12 2018-02-28 23:58:15 I posted earlier that it is possible oil and product markets could be signaling slowing economies in the face of 3-4 more rate hikes. (Why isn't the US$ higher?)
13 2018-02-28 23:58:01 I tend to focus on the wrong things. How do they get the oil off the furniture? What happens if someone slips in it? Do they have liability insurance? The insurance agent in me can't help it 
14 2018-02-28 23:57:55 Pennsylvania oil rush was a boom in petroleum production which occurred in northwestern Pennsylvania (1859 to the early 1870. )It was the first oil boom in the United States. The oil rush began in Titusville, Pennsylvania, in the Oil Creek Valley when he struck "rock oil" there.

40 2018-02-28 23:57:22 we gotta stop using oil and yesterday. remember all that oil int he sea in 2010. warming water even a few degrees will kill coral. they are  vital to all life. it will be a relic before I die
41 2018-02-28 23:57:20 He is becoming a true politician or snake oil salesmen
42 2018-02-28 23:56:59 ISIS territory reduced by 98% including the loss of oil field income sources. Weapons going to the Ukraine, Poland, and Saudis to oppose Russia and Iran, a Russian ally. 

I see all of this being opposed by Democrats. 

Insanity.
43 2018-02-28 23:56:50 I’m on fertility medicine and can’t take any pain relievers for my headaches. Peppermint essential oil on my forehead has saved me the past 5 months!
44 2018-02-28 23:56:48 I just took some thc/CBD oil  bc I’m in pain and it tasted like fried chicken what
45 2018-02-28 23:56:27 When the oil price rises again.
The business council whinges about govt deficit yet shut up when business tax cuts were mentioned.
And where are those corrupt ratings agencies ? Hmmmm
46 2018-02-28 23:56:20 Everything oil and gas related being proved for oblivion sooner than later.
47 2018-02-28 23:56:13 While there is a business on the blood, while there is America, there will be evil on the earth. Washington feeds terrorists to steal oil!
48 2018-02-28 23:55:56 Sounds a bit like the bureaus I opened in Lynchburg, Virginia, and South Charleston, West Virginia, back when oil trains were blowing up.
49 2018-02-28 23:55:55 in other news my supervisor is on town this week n we ordered dominos cheesy bread for lunch and I’m still feeling icky from all that oil and cheese
50 2018-02-28 23:55:53 We'll never have a completely safe society. Not gonna happen. Somebody always screws up, does some bad deeds. Question is, how do you isolate these faults without limiting society's freedoms overall. So if an easy way out is to arm teachers, passively secure schools....
51 2018-02-28 23:55:46 We continue to subsidize oil companies while many scietists are ignored. Nothing honourable about my country when it comes to the environment
52 2018-02-28 23:55:36 make sure it’s 100% coconut oil tho 
53 2018-02-28 23:55:32 Went out for breakfast and coffee. A mushroom medley fricasseed with basil oil and thyme on brioche with a poached egg and bacon. The coffee was great too. 

Got the day off and it’s beautiful outside! 
54 2018-02-28 23:55:29 MY MOM HAS MOBBIN W NO FUCKING OIL
55 2018-02-28 23:55:24 If they tried swinging hockey sticks or lacrosse sticks now, we would just “Liberate” them for their frozen ass oil and maple syrup.
56 2018-02-28 23:55:18 Word. And think about all the oil production in the Persian Gulf that would be at risk.
57 2018-02-28 23:54:50 Harry Reid!?!?!
58 2018-02-28 23:54:39 First Oil Well, First Oil Well Fire. Edwin L. Drake, right, stands with friend Peter Wilson of Titusville, Pennsylvania, at the drilling site – but not the original derrick – of America's first commercial oil well of 1859
59 2018-02-28 23:53:46 Well, those "prophets" and the like sell all sorts of "snake oil", and like to go to war against anything (incl. politics) they feel will make them gain popularity... despicable
60 2018-02-28 23:53:25 What if Saudi said "yep we'll have some of those CNY oil futures"?
61 2018-02-28 23:53:21 tesco sell Gram flour,  make a curry as normal and then add the flour, make it really really thick like doughballs and simply drop a teaspoon of the mixture into hot oil, sorted
62 2018-02-28 23:53:05 There may be people who claim to be prophets and messenger of #Oil and #Gas,
Take you to guidance, to sacrificing on the pipeline. heaven waiting for you
don't worry be ready
63 2018-02-28 23:52:59 Me da casi ternura que haya gente que piense que la corrupción describe al PRI y sólo al PRI. Todos los demás (partidos, ciudadanos, medios) son pura inocencia.
64 2018-02-28 23:52:30 The South does, not just Texas. And so do many, more rural states in the interior.
65 2018-02-28 23:52:13 Same here I’ll have grease or oil on me and not one customer or coworker wants to say anything smh 
66 2018-02-28 23:52:12 Sure, when the economy was in recession as oil prices plummeted. Basic economics my friend, basic economics...
67 2018-02-28 23:51:47 If Patchouli oil had a face, it would be yours
68 2018-02-28 23:51:46 Ooh! I forgot about CCs red stripes. I feel you on the blonde. Today when she lightened a bunch of mine I had a moment panic. Weirdly I feel like my oil slick hair is less drastic.
69 2018-02-28 23:51:43 Shea butter and castor oil.
70 2018-02-28 23:51:31 Wow lies and more lies!! Why should we live in the stone age because you're in the pocket of the oil and gas industry. We need to innovate! China is crushing us in clean energy. Lots of other countries are investing in clean energy. It's the way of the future! Grow up!
71 2018-02-28 23:51:28 Using the numbers from a minute ago, you still have 3 other teachers plus the SRO..
72 2018-02-28 23:51:27 My son is already slicker than a can of oil and he’s only 3 
73 2018-02-28 23:51:19 My da delivered central heating oil. ‘The help’ 11 months a year. ‘Mr Nolan’ when they ran out of oil.

77 2018-02-28 23:51:01 Great practice for using ink/washes and dry brushing highlights. If you can get GW nuln oil or seraphim sepia, they work really well as is. Vallejo washes need to be thin, they work fine but are not quite as "wet". Having a brown, black and flesh wash is all you want.
78 2018-02-28 23:50:46 And maintain? Lol I have an olive oil spray I’ve prob used twice when I was feeling adventurous otherwise.... if I tie my head it stays “fresh” longer
79 2018-02-28 23:50:34 im like 4000 miles overdue for an oil change
80 2018-02-28 23:50:31 Canada could not use all our oil in the next 5000 years so let's sell it now
81 2018-02-28 23:50:20 オレも前にリツイートした気がするーーーーーーｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗ
82 2018-02-28 23:49:55 why not 2018? the past year and a half was driven by massive stock appreciation that has now ended.  Oil prices were held up by "once in a hundred year" hurricanes.  Interest rates are higher.  Trade and budget deficits are also on the rise even with a weak dollar.
83 2018-02-28 23:49:50 I’m in love with the drunk elephant Virgin Marula oil. I have very dry and sensitive skin.
84 2018-02-28 23:49:41 Gracias mi estimado!
85 2018-02-28 23:49:40 The big ocean cargo ships that use marine oil are the worst for emissions. I'll find the stats, but the parts per million content of sulphur bi product from those ships is astronomical
86 2018-02-28 23:49:39 Probably favorite oil ever
87 2018-02-28 23:49:33 It is not strategically possible to lock down the world's third largest oil reserve. Albertans have to start thinking outside of the box about alternative political arrangements.
88 2018-02-28 23:49:30 1 in 20, still good. Especially if they talk about it internally. Better than one SRO. Especially if that's like that waste of space parked out in from of #Parkland.
89 2018-02-28 23:49:24 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。
90 2018-02-28 23:48:35 Opportunistically when crude oil prices nearly doubling over last 12 months or so and rebel China/Iran sponsored non USD anti OPEC petro currency splutters.
91 2018-02-28 23:48:34 220億の損失ってなんだって思ってたーーーーーーｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗ
92 2018-02-28 23:48:19 1 in 12 teachers. Let's say a school has 50 teachers, that's 4 extra guns in addition to the SRO, makes 5. And once some do, they might convince others.
93 2018-02-28 23:48:13 [food]

i really need to start looking into how to prepare tofu other than frying it, bc ik i should cut down on oil but all i ever wanna eat is tofu

95 2018-02-28 23:48:05 Thank you for protecting BC's coast. Risk of oil spill is just one risk, the effects of increased tanker traffic (increased noise, pollution, ship strikes) on #SRKW & marine ecosystem are other critical risks to address. We have much at stake even without spill. @AJWVictoriaBC
96 2018-02-28 23:47:54 After repulsing attack, Russians & Syrians were allowed to retreat unmolested. US & Kurdish forces could have wiped them out to a man. No incursions against oil facilities since.
97 2018-02-28 23:47:33 I just straighten it!! Sometimes Ill use a little hairspray or a little oil but other than that it pretty much stays how I do it.
98 2018-02-28 23:47:25 That, OK. Question stays, how many of these have actually been exposed to guns, how many would change their opinion once they did? I know a bunch of teachers who carry. More that these stats suggest.

111 2018-02-28 23:45:11 What's wrong with this? @LushLtd are right to spread the word. Obesity largely caused by excessive car use (causing pollution) and, palm oil and factory farmed meat consumption. Which then costs the NHS. 

If this is 'fat shaming' then anti smoking adverts must be smoker shaming
112 2018-02-28 23:44:59 Are you using full synthetic oil? It's all I use.

121 2018-02-28 23:43:30 Another snake oil salesman promoting his team.  Good riddance.
122 2018-02-28 23:43:24 Caraway has one front paw pad that's dry & cracked. I've been rubbing coconut oil on it for the past 3 days & every time she starts sniffing around for what smells like coconut for several minutes before realizing it's her own foot.
123 2018-02-28 23:43:22 And we need moats...and quick sand...And towers that we can drop boiling oil from.  And pendulums,  alligators, and trap doors, and catapults. #NRABloodMoney #GunControlNow #ClueLessGOP
124 2018-02-28 23:43:21 How do we know that, and have they actually ever held a gun?

128 2018-02-28 23:43:10 Did they change the formula to Wild Growth Hair oil? It smells less earthy and more medicinal 
129 2018-02-28 23:43:00 “Who needs a glo up when you already shine?” I ask myself as I wipe the oil off of my never-washed face
130 2018-02-28 23:42:51 Got my oil changed and Kaylee got new shoes. Now I’m just ready to go home cause Kaylee has work my last nerve. 
131 2018-02-28 23:42:40 Girl..CBD oil is no joke, Jareds mom has a kidney disease that causes her extreme pain and also makes her entire body swell up, so she drops like 6-7 drops of CBD oil in her mouth every morning, her swelling has gone down significantly and she no longer has any pain!
132 2018-02-28 23:42:30 That’s about as smart as telling people not to buy gas on one particular day to put pressure on “Big Oil.” Of course, we’re used to strident stupidity from you.
133 2018-02-28 23:42:23 The oil turned him red.

135 2018-02-28 23:42:21 I had a speech prepared ready to go off on the mechanic for taking 2 hours on a scheduled oil change but he did it for free due to the wait. Now I gotta alter this speech and deliver my pent up anger at someone else.
136 2018-02-28 23:42:20 @SenMarkey Continued.Oil Central Heating on far too high and for too long. Televisions left on in unattended rooms.Computers left on during meal and break times.

Which air pollutants would be reduced if we utilized  if no more oil/petroleum
144 2018-02-28 23:41:16 Take it, but take what the bottle says...it says 2tbs and you take 3 u got problems! I like the @Onnit brand, emulsified mct, that way u can mix in hot and cold drinks with no oil separation
145 2018-02-28 23:40:57 Yeah it's what you eat. Nuts and veggies all day is fine.

I drink "bullet-proof" coffee. Not the brand, I just use Folgers coffee, coconut oil, and avacado oil. Blend the heck out of it. Keeps my appetite down till the afternoon.

Google bulletproof coffee, but don't get sold.
146 2018-02-28 23:40:47 Hypothetically speaking..IF this China Yuan Gold whatever contract were to gain traction ...you know what they would do? They would try and sink oil price faster than you can spin your head
147 2018-02-28 23:40:40 Why is it crucial for life on the earth’s surface that oxygen did start forming in the atmosphere?
What surprised you the most from the oil spill activity and why?
Give three reasons to stop utilizing fossil fuels, one from air, one from water, one from a diversity standpoint.
148 2018-02-28 23:40:33 You have your corrupted parties confused. The Republicans are the corrupt party owned by the NRA, Big Tobacco, and Big Oil. Not to mention Russia. Not a single Democrat indictment.
149 2018-02-28 23:40:31 ベスーベスー！はははやめろってくすぐったい～
150 2018-02-28 23:40:16 これ？ドレッシングっていうか廃油。
151 2018-02-28 23:40:13 I am capitalism and my anatomy is the anatomy of a monster, I breathe fire, I consume oil, I tinker with your pretty brains.
152 2018-02-28 23:40:09 So other than getting fried in oil what else do you do ? 
153 2018-02-28 23:39:52 That is the USA for ya. All about the oil and to damn with the infrastructure of the middle east!
154 2018-02-28 23:39:51 جيش الفهد معااااكك الله يسسعدك ويرزقك الجنه وان شاءالله تكون صادق
155 2018-02-28 23:39:42 室温は２０度近くあるのですが、灯油消化のため、ストーブつける苦行も同時開催中！
156 2018-02-28 23:39:26 And with that we'd have mission accomplished. A believable deterrent would suffice to keep school shootings from happening, because a potential shooter knows he'd wind up dead in a hurry.
157 2018-02-28 23:39:26 Wasn't it an oil refinery?
158 2018-02-28 23:39:22 We aren't asking anyone to fight our wars, but Iran having nukes is everybody's problem, they are developing intercontinental ballistic missiles, not to mention USA interests are also at stake with  the oil industry. #Israel Israel
159 2018-02-28 23:39:19 i only came to houston early to change my oil and buy jeans with no holes and ended up buying 5 new fits and clothes i don’t need
160 2018-02-28 23:39:19 Their willingness and comfort to get oil from the Middle East could ultimately cause their own demise.   They either have no clue what's ahead or don't care for one or more reasons.
161 2018-02-28 23:39:13 Lol nah fam. Pizza Hut pours straight oil on your shit before they deliver it
162 2018-02-28 23:38:55 Um... This story is misleading. Sure, higher overall spending on electricity, but Southeast also leads the nation in use of electricity for heating. - expenditure on gas, fuel oil, etc + more actual heating + higher elec rates in other parts of country
163 2018-02-28 23:38:34 I was feeling fatigued, so I put some peppermint & grapefruit oil in my diffuser, and now I’m 
164 2018-02-28 23:38:32 @billsweet fear not as wage/incomes & oil/energy are fast on the last lap! They’ll be the final straw that breaks the mkt back

167 2018-02-28 23:38:24 Again, I'm fairly sure one could find enough teachers who'd be willing to carry. Only one way to find out.
168 2018-02-28 23:38:22 Wahoo! We are so happy! Thank you! 
169 2018-02-28 23:38:20 You should deal with the oil issue raised by the residents not these nonsense you are talking about here PUGA!!
170 2018-02-28 23:38:16 I think that was a little generous, that shit leaves an oil slick on your tongue
171 2018-02-28 23:37:57 If by "versatile defensive playmaker" you mean "actor for local oil change dealership" than I agree.
172 2018-02-28 23:37:49 Beard oil is such a game changer
173 2018-02-28 23:37:35 ... of the issue at hand, the willful ignorance, rejection of early warning signs, no follow up despite clear indication that something is wrong. Applies to patients requiring therapy, treatment, as well as perps requiring jail-time.
174 2018-02-28 23:37:26 Wrong. Check Stats Canada data on oil imports to Canada.
175 2018-02-28 23:37:17 Anyone who believes that has a childs perception of economics. Big oil is not one unified blob with the same incentives. It is different players competing. Big oil loves the cartelization of their industry.
176 2018-02-28 23:37:06 Got an essential oil set (thanks for the Amazon card) & I’m obsessed - you can use them for everything!
177 2018-02-28 23:37:05 To the best of my understanding the CSM classes are generally quite good. I'm a bit more concerned about PSM classes as I've been told, but do not know, that their trainers are not always very experienced. 

So "snake oil"? Where do you get that?
178 2018-02-28 23:36:58 I tried coconut oil and I’m here an hour later almost in tears, one eye intact, one looking like total crap, in pain with about 5 lashes left 
179 2018-02-28 23:36:57 @AfAmUcla #uclam5    The name of the book she wrote is Vetiver. It means a kind of oil, important to human live. Also she said it means creativity, inspiring.

181 2018-02-28 23:36:37 Yeah let's build a glass wall around schools and then... They'll think of anything before dropping gun sales.
182 2018-02-28 23:36:19 Me, after going on a globetrotting adventure in which I fall in love, am betrayed, watch my best friends die, and am left with myriad scars both mental and physical all to save Guernica by Picasso: I FUCKING HATE OIL PAINTINGS GOD DAMMIT.
183 2018-02-28 23:36:00 Well, if somebody wants to check out prematurely, there is little to keep them from doing so, unless one acts upon warning signs. The truly intent will find a way, if not with a gun, then something else. And with that we are back to the root cause...
184 2018-02-28 23:35:44 I keep thinking back to that Steven Seagul vs oil baron in Alaska movie.
185 2018-02-28 23:35:31 What kind of oil are the fries cooked in?
186 2018-02-28 23:35:28 Ok, extending your logic - ban ALL guns. Every last one of 'em. I've lived 62 years quite happily without ever shooting anything. Take up golf. Stamp-collecting. White-water rafting. Rock-climbing. Oil painting. 

Or rescuing animals - much more rewarding than killing them.
187 2018-02-28 23:35:24 Decided to sleep in baby oil tonight and I feel fucking disgusting 
188 2018-02-28 23:35:23 I was outside on a external oil boiler breakdown and then the snow dumped on me, I was like that Disney film.

194 2018-02-28 23:34:47 It used to be "our police don't carry". When I was over there, but that was a very long time ago. Easier means to travel means easier availability of illegal guns.
195 2018-02-28 23:34:46 I never cease to marvel at the insatiable Hunger of America for charletons and snake oil. I must be missing something.
196 2018-02-28 23:34:22 I'm sticking to my #coconut & #butter. I don't use #vegetable oils or#margarine. I #love #nuts,& #olive #oil. I #cook with #coconut oil. It can take higher #heat. #Low #heat for olive oil & butters.
197 2018-02-28 23:34:19 I agree but the rest of Canada doesn’t care. They get their oil from ME.  BC gets a lot from Washington. I ‘ve been told here by many B.C. and some easterners that they don’t care about Alberta and our problem with being landlocked.  Nice. But they will accept our$$$$
198 2018-02-28 23:33:50 By olive oil you mean butter
199 2018-02-28 23:33:31 I’ve been using baby oil as a mosterizer  but I want to look dewy but not smell like a preschool 
200 2018-02-28 23:33:11 I don’t like them if non are illegal.
Their religion and our constitution are like oil and water.
I personally, prefer our constitution!
201 2018-02-28 23:33:07 The past two days have low key ruined me, I'm physically, mentally, and emotionally exhausted as fuck

Imma take an essential oil bath, catch y'all on the flip 
202 2018-02-28 23:33:07 So the oil I put in my hair after I straighten it smells so good
203 2018-02-28 23:33:02 Idk about y’all, but i really like @GovHolcomb. He’s getting the job done with this alc sales on Sunday AND they’re working on CBD oil. 
204 2018-02-28 23:32:37 You have destroyed any legitimacy you might have had by your disgraceful behaviour and your alliance with liars and snake oil salesmen

206 2018-02-28 23:32:36 ridiculous oil heater makes you smashed
207 2018-02-28 23:32:36 evidently Russia can't even drill its own oil
208 2018-02-28 23:32:33 Oil
209 2018-02-28 23:32:31 I just had it your right it tastes like motor oil
210 2018-02-28 23:32:25 Sorry 1 last question lol. What are your thoughts on MCT oil alone and on Keto? Does it actually help and is it needed or just preference?
211 2018-02-28 23:32:23 How likely is it that I’ll get my oil changed and emissions tested today?

217 2018-02-28 23:31:06 Big oil receives so many subsidies that their effective tax rate is 0... I guess it’s not ready yet either, why are we using a dirty technology as opposed to sunshine and wind...?
218 2018-02-28 23:31:00 coffe still tastes bad to me... but olives, they always were good for me, but as i said already, that's probably due to the copious amount of olive oil we use(but black still feel weird, i can tell you that)

220 2018-02-28 23:30:46 I changed my diesels oil for like 60 bucks only thanks to the best auto parts guys around. #advertising
221 2018-02-28 23:30:44 but i think its because i started going to the gym again.... or the fact my body reacts a little to too much oil,butter, and sugar in foods
222 2018-02-28 23:30:30 OIL DIFF: 3.18 -> 3.24
223 2018-02-28 23:30:26 Police acting without thinking tend to take out innocent suspects, and, in most cases, get to take the fall for it. Yet, we don't disarm police.
224 2018-02-28 23:30:11 I love everything the @BosPublicMarket is about, but every time I spend more than 10mins in there, I leave with my clothes smelling like cooking oil. =(
225 2018-02-28 23:30:05 this oil pen come in clutch at work
226 2018-02-28 23:30:00 I'm just gonna say it: I don't get all the oil in the pornos. It just seems unnecessarily messy. And hard to wash out of hair. #WhatAboutTheFurniture
227 2018-02-28 23:29:53 Gotta hate the profit-loss! My condolences, dear oil company.
228 2018-02-28 23:29:38 That's why you train, train, train. You don't take shots that kill others than your target. With one offender, more than one teacher, chances are one of them has a clean shot.
229 2018-02-28 23:29:35 아!!...stop! 
-flinch and quickly move to aside, luckily did not spill the hot oil while taking out the chicken and put on the plate-
230 2018-02-28 23:29:27 My dude! I'm only cooking with Chicken at this point too on top of only using coconut oil.

233 2018-02-28 23:29:08 The issue is really how stretched and one sided positioning is on treasuries shorts and oil longs by hedge funds/swap dealers.  Any news that says inflation isn't as expected unwinds those positions.  We can see the 30yr & 10yr go back to 2.25-2.50 range by summer & oil sub 50.
234 2018-02-28 23:29:06 In between the “what my father did” and the “sat in a chair” one is one about news reports, stealing oil and god saving gas prices???
235 2018-02-28 23:28:55 Mine was doing the same thing. Start using tarte maracuja oil, it works wonders!
236 2018-02-28 23:28:41 Had my wife and her mom "organize" my kitchen.  I don't know where half the shit is anymore and I'm tempted to just buy everything again instead of figuring out why this drawer has a colander, 2 spatulas, and an old dish towel; and the coconut oil is by the cleaning supplies.
237 2018-02-28 23:28:38 Reality check

244 2018-02-28 23:25:55 At least astrology is based upon superstition, therefore impossible to come up with a realistic horse shit plan for snake oil salesmen (sic) to sell it. The other three have a cadre of liars paid as professors who are in fact grifters who perpetuate pseudo science.
245 2018-02-28 23:25:50 Yes, can’t say for sure it worked but I did officially go into labor after I took it  it’s gross but you’re a perfect candidate lol I tried spicy pickles, fresh pineapple, but I guess castor oil did the trick, it could upset your stomach tho 
246 2018-02-28 23:25:43 You can't take responsibility for something that is not considered wrong. That's why we have laws. But, laws should not be overbearing, implemented carefully. To get reelected, many politicians like to look strong on paper, so they propose more legislation, not less.
247 2018-02-28 23:25:41 それなんて改修案件？
248 2018-02-28 23:25:28 Yeah so but is drones being sold all over knowing that the countries wouldn't make money on the oil selling a tax gases and stuff they've all had the drones that they bought from us it hasn't came out when Bush was in office and and all the oil money and stuff so that's what's

257 2018-02-28 23:24:17 YET, Like Oil and Gas in the North Sea being a curse on the people of Scotland, so it seems, was saving every student in Scotland £2,289.

That's pushing political point scoring against the #SNP just a bit too far.
258 2018-02-28 23:24:15 Violence against unarmed women is prevalent. That's why I strongly suggest for any woman to learn how to use a gun, get the license, carry. Make colleges to allow carry-on-campus, watch campus rape rates go down. In a hurry. /cc @noleforjustice
259 2018-02-28 23:23:55 We already have a NEWFOUNDLAND... between the mismanagement of our fishery, our mining, destroying our native culture and now exploiting our coast for big oil I would say Mars will be doomed by the "merchants" who pillaged us...

270 2018-02-28 23:22:03 It's an old clip & the news was reporting the hoax as it came in, so they were kinda clueless until they stopped to THINK. 
Kinda like a meme that's been going around again about Irish accent & words Whale, Oil, Beef, Hooked.

272 2018-02-28 23:21:57 That's the worse thing I've ever heard. You know what else relieves headaches. Water, peppermint oil, a bath or shower, good posture, I'm sure the list goes on. Drinking a hot mountain dew has to be the worse thing I've ever heard.

276 2018-02-28 23:21:12 the USA is interesting, in oil and selling arms, not in people. without selling, arms wouldn't be a rich country, anyway if you poor country than your overlooked by the USA, unless you are in the strategic position
277 2018-02-28 23:20:49  halloween already? Or opening an oil pipeline?
278 2018-02-28 23:20:39 I disagree. The ones I know here ... let's face it, a good part carries As in, they do have an LTC, and they are packing. Unfortunately, that's not something some ISDs support or allow.

Seguro le dijeron "y ponte bonita mija para que sea viral". Este nivel chafa de discusión alimenta la indolencia de los políticos.
284 2018-02-28 23:19:39 Houston’s all about the oil. Must be a campaign fundraiser
285 2018-02-28 23:19:30 try a type of oil. I've been using my face oil for lips too now.
286 2018-02-28 23:19:27 i would pack my bags and leave and this brain drain will finish them off like Venezuela .. I know im sounding like an asshole here but that's the truth .. Norway became rich in the 60s & 70s with all the foreign capital drilling for oil
287 2018-02-28 23:19:25 Watching our Oil is our pastime. I like the game & my Oil ‘cause I’m a fan. Negativity takes away from the fun. What I am going to do is screen out negativity. It seems each season an Oiler is chosen as a whipping boy (Horc, Petry, Schultz, Lucic). It’s Time to stop doing that!
288 2018-02-28 23:19:23 No, it does not. There is this thing called individual responsibility, where one takes credit for one's actions, or admits to doing wrong, bearing the consequences. You don't hold society at fault for the failures of individuals.

290 2018-02-28 23:19:10 the double bag is same day from amazon...... "adds to that list".....  I have a list for same day amazon ordering.  66% of it is chocolate and the other is the coconut oil.
291 2018-02-28 23:19:05 No need for oil for frying. Chiclet teeth has enough grease on his hair to light up Manhattan.

294 2018-02-28 23:19:02 Little happy adult moment. After 22 years I finally learned how to change the oil in my car 
295 2018-02-28 23:18:50 I hope the blessings were performed correctly with Rem oil
296 2018-02-28 23:18:26 Oh my GOD if I never see the words “Trump thinks” in that order again it will be TOO SOON. “Thinks” is WAY too generous. He’s a sack of germophobic, ass-covering, shame-deflecting, raindrop-runoff-pouring-on-Barron anger impulses in a suspension of hydrogenated soybean oil.
297 2018-02-28 23:18:26 The earth can withstand the oil a little at the time. But what we are doing now are getting all the oil that we find to than burn it. Unfortanatly the earth can't handle it all. So you are pretty smart when you say you want the clean renewable energy that doesn't harm the earth.
298 2018-02-28 23:18:21 Just add oil
299 2018-02-28 23:18:17 I got hot engine oil in my eye 
300 2018-02-28 23:18:16 The quintessential mid-90s car was the forest green Ford Explorer.

302 2018-02-28 23:18:02 That kid is only 14? I have hope for the future again.
303 2018-02-28 23:17:51 Better wash it clean the inside and put a oil change on her thanks 
304 2018-02-28 23:17:45 olives and coffee are an "acquired taste" oversea? ...eh, i guess vegemite is for anyone that isn't australian too anyway.

note:am italian, home of the espresso and olive oil, just to add some context to what i said
305 2018-02-28 23:17:41 Not sounding true to me. Millennial s are not into oil, they want electric and clean energy, not into guns, not into war & terror- those are Track words.
Education of “Hippie” is in with peace.
306 2018-02-28 23:17:40 Got out of all my oil short before market close today. Hoping a small bounce tonight, I can short it again tomorrow above $62.
307 2018-02-28 23:17:32 I get oil heating is expensive but c’mon Claire it’s -7 outside 
308 2018-02-28 23:17:32 So instead, we had a snake oil salesmen sway a minority of the people, and he was elected.
309 2018-02-28 23:17:03 Seperti peristiwa matinya Orang utan di Gunung Leuser tempo hari di viral kan ama seorang PhD environment Amrik. Gara gara Palm oil, Padahal Orang utan tsb mati karena Penyakit , What the Issue folk. Mereka ga ingin Minyak goreng kita membanjiri pasar dunia.
310 2018-02-28 23:16:53 LNG is viable because it can assist China reducing its dependence on coal. Tar sand oil is, and always has been, dependent on high petroleum prices.
311 2018-02-28 23:16:49 Want to know something about Lex Luthor? He's bald like Mr.Clean. He uses baby oil to shine his bald head.
312 2018-02-28 23:16:48 Okay, y'all, I need some help! I need some policy info to read, specifically:

rural healthcare
renewable energy, including how to integrate it into oil and gas
general infrastructure
public education
voting rights

Please comment below or DM me!
Thanks so much!

313 2018-02-28 23:16:46 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
314 2018-02-28 23:16:38 Totally craving a salad with coconut oil and biodynamic kale.
315 2018-02-28 23:16:27 Depression makes you tired.  It just does. It could also be hormonal. I take 1300mgs of evening primrose oil every day and that helps with my moods tremendously. B complex and fish oil also help!
316 2018-02-28 23:16:05 OIL BRENT US$65.79/bbl -2.7%. Iraq in agreement with Kurds over eventual restart of export flows through the Kirkuk oil pipeline.
317 2018-02-28 23:16:02 No school tomorrow so I’ve covered my hair in coconut oil and wrapped it in a towel for an overnight deep condition! #longhairsecrets #healthyhair
318 2018-02-28 23:15:24 It was the first game of the season at Lucas Oil field in Indy. Matt Forte took one to the house. It was beautiful.
319 2018-02-28 23:15:22 
320 2018-02-28 23:15:16 “Hippy” as a term for the 20’s Gen is now making sense.. It was degraded by whoever in media. The concept of an economy of peace is now cool with youth. Guns are out, oil is out... hence prime time education of what is what is in . Peace and delight for the human heart & soul.
321 2018-02-28 23:15:15 This is with oil cleanser. I KNOW.
322 2018-02-28 23:14:55 I'm opposed to off-shore drilling for oil off of New England coasts.
323 2018-02-28 23:14:52 You ran out of oil ( hat in in house !)?
324 2018-02-28 23:14:51 Actually excited for my cbd oil to come
325 2018-02-28 23:14:31 Sue Andrews prefers killing of foreign Gays. Canada’s Gay friendly Oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss  off buildings.
326 2018-02-28 23:14:30 @JimRyanThePulse Peppermint oil messaged into temples or down neck. Eat a peppermint if you don’t have oil.
327 2018-02-28 23:14:23 @KLOVERadio the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the Lord, which he spake by Elijah-1 kings chapter 17 verse 16 kjv of the Bible
328 2018-02-28 23:14:02 The amount of times I’ve turned the tv off due to frustration for this team is silly. I love watching hockey but it’s hard to lately with the oil
329 2018-02-28 23:14:00 It's something that has not been tried before. All the restriction suggestions won't fix the root cause, and that's a systemic failure, non-compliance with rules, regulations and procedures.
330 2018-02-28 23:14:00 GTO stands for Gas Tires & Oil. Everybody knows that.
331 2018-02-28 23:13:56 Scotland's oil & Gas has underpinned the "UK" economy for decades.

OIL！
333 2018-02-28 23:13:49 @holisticbanana what the fuck are you on about? ' engine oil'? This stuff treats my pain better than anything. Cannabis for the win. Its a magic thing that has been proven to kill cancer...whats you beef you mental?
334 2018-02-28 23:13:46 Didn't a oil major just pull out recently, tossing the goons the keys?
335 2018-02-28 23:13:32 Who is going to vote for it? Already, all the coastal states are rejecting Trump’s coastal drilling for oil. No one wants the pollution .
336 2018-02-28 23:13:30 All i wanna do is love you and dip that body in a little oil baby
337 2018-02-28 23:13:24 It's consistent.  Kiss first... take the oil... take out their families...take the guns, then...
338 2018-02-28 23:13:22 @petejohn10 #SDF us doesntneed oil. Swims in natgasnow. So who steals
339 2018-02-28 23:13:20 I’m gone need y’all to use y’all tax money to get y’all oil changed .
340 2018-02-28 23:12:59 As I've said before, arm the teachers. Let them try. Don't rule out the option. This is America: we try things, when they don't work, we try something else. We are not supposed to limit rights just because the street demands it.
341 2018-02-28 23:12:36 Did you boycott Arab oil too?
342 2018-02-28 23:12:20 Mark Worthing prefers killing of foreign Gays. Canada’s Gay friendly Oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that throw  off Buildings. Protesting #KMX= killing #LGBTQ. By far, Vivian Krause is Canada’s Best investigative journalist.
343 2018-02-28 23:12:03 I miss the time when the idiot liberals weren't trying to infringe on my 2nd amendment rights.
When I could just post neat news from my engineering and offshore oil professional life. *sigh*
344 2018-02-28 23:11:56 going to Chicago in a month. Big ups to Big Oil, but what about VeNtUrE cApItAlIsTs???
345 2018-02-28 23:11:47 Professors reinforcing the new name Orange County Community College.
346 2018-02-28 23:11:41 I agree Bree but Alberta will never get our oil out in Canada or be treated like the other Provinces.  At least our oil would be worth something there.
347 2018-02-28 23:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza for lunch today will be: chewy crust with wet motor oil and spinach.

350 2018-02-28 23:10:51 All of it , everything that's clean. We don't need to keep polluting the earth. I mean I know oil comes from the core , maybe earth needs it there. Does anyone really know.  Magnetic field also. Quantum physics all way above my head . You look young.  be a doctor in this field
351 2018-02-28 23:10:46 Oil changed  engine air filter changed

355 2018-02-28 23:10:22 Yea - a variety of As I Am, Jamaican castor oil, coconut oil, shea moisture, cantu and ogyx. Heat treatments at least twice a month and just braid it down and wore a wig.
356 2018-02-28 23:10:20 ああ、これはまずい。実にまずい。0.1トン超えたよ。
357 2018-02-28 23:10:09 As long as we’re moving...  

Seriously though, USA was headed in the wrong direction for sometime. 

I read a compelling Story stating our oil replenishes & actually doesn’t run out. Don’t know but we have been tricked &robbed for years by Corrupt Political Hacks Repugs & Dems
358 2018-02-28 23:10:03 You have never seen a mom backed into a corner? Doesn't get any more vicious than that.
359 2018-02-28 23:09:48 Have you tried essential oils? Some of them can be a bit pricey but Peppermint oil often does wonders for my migraines. 
360 2018-02-28 23:09:44 I really wish that when chefs say “put some oil in a pan” they would say what kind of oil. #chefs #cooking #teaching
361 2018-02-28 23:09:41 my jojoba oil came in the mail 
362 2018-02-28 23:09:34 2018 when devs discovered coconut oil!
363 2018-02-28 23:09:28 And we are back to the beginning, where all get to be held accountable for the actions of one.
364 2018-02-28 23:09:20 As an economist from the Treasury said to me when I asked if Scotland could go on its own he simply said the economy will go up & down just as it does with the UK. Few have our resources, tech capability & inventiveness. We’ll do fine. Bonus oil price up & production costs halved
365 2018-02-28 23:09:14 I exercise caution because it could have been olive oil...
366 2018-02-28 23:09:09 Pork bellies and snake oil are my retirement, so I sure hope so...
367 2018-02-28 23:09:06 I love working from home because I get so much more work done. I’ve literally did all my work, got a passport, an oil change, run a few errands, and I’m chilling.
368 2018-02-28 23:08:56 CBD oil or lavender could help with her anxiety ..
369 2018-02-28 23:08:54 Their pineapple papaya scrub and midnight recovery oil will make you look like a smooth and tender infant.
370 2018-02-28 23:08:51 And a maple syrup ‘reserve’ as we do oil!
371 2018-02-28 23:08:51 You'd be surprised what you can, and will do without hesitation once your own, or the lives of those in your custody, are at stake.
372 2018-02-28 23:08:39 Vitamin E oil !!
373 2018-02-28 23:08:17 Hot Epson salt bath. Essential oil’s. I’m into that holistic shit. It really does help.
374 2018-02-28 23:08:17 My guess is whale oil..
375 2018-02-28 23:08:17 Jesus I just need the smell of gas and oil again
376 2018-02-28 23:08:11 capitalism is creative in ability to sometimes circumvent/ destroy barriers to capital flow--such as encountering natural limits like finding new sources of oil or confronting political power of the working class in unions--but capitalism is also incredibly self-destructive 
377 2018-02-28 23:07:57 Bertone cooks turkey bacon with avocado oil and says it tastes exactly the same.
378 2018-02-28 23:07:55 ... hand them an easy to control handgun or rifle, also ammo, plus a stack of targets. Works wonders.

It just takes a modicum of time and effort. Actually, not effort. Fun ain't effort.
379 2018-02-28 23:07:49 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!

382 2018-02-28 23:07:30 I have sesame oil in my nose and it smells so gross. I think @sirenecynique was just messing with me 
383 2018-02-28 23:07:29 You can’t say you love and listen to Rap/Hip-Hop if you don’t know and love James Brown. The shit don’t mix like oil and water.
384 2018-02-28 23:07:24 @LizMacDonaldFOX Shale/fracking miracle needed in 1973. Arab oil embargo devastated US economy with hyperinflation. Caused US to force Israel to not destroy encircled Egyptian 3rd army, and flatten Damascus and Cairo. US and west politically and economically held hostage to OPEC.
385 2018-02-28 23:07:22 Tar sand and LNG projects are multi-year projects that withstand oil price volatility.   They don’t withstand government views such as those by Trudeau government.
386 2018-02-28 23:07:12 that’s a GOOD thing. We don’t want spilled oil ruining the Jersey Shore!

390 2018-02-28 23:06:58 He certainly isn't for me. I see him as a snake oil salesman.
391 2018-02-28 23:06:56 Yea, yea, and the English have the Gas fields off East Anglia.  Taxes collected from Scottish oil production fell from £1.8bn in 2015 to just £60m in 2016. The gap between tax revenues and what Scotland spends is now 9.5 per cent, ...Need I go on?
392 2018-02-28 23:06:55 coconut oil & water = your bestfriends
393 2018-02-28 23:06:44 Bitcoin and snake oil.

395 2018-02-28 23:06:23 Cooking methods for optimum #fertility: Steam, grill, roast, bake, stir-fry (little coconut oil only), shred, eat raw, or casserole
396 2018-02-28 23:06:21 An oil change is like $400 unless you want to prop it up yourself and still lose value because it’s not their oil.

400 2018-02-28 23:05:51 Could that be the case because too many parents incorrectly, mistakenly think that guns are for boys, not girls? In these gendered days you can't rule that out.

Taking time to explain, what to (not) do, what's where and what it's for, then ....
401 2018-02-28 23:05:39 yeah it can slightly damage ur hair depending on how much oil and weight ur hair carries if u shampoo every day
402 2018-02-28 23:05:39 If @realDonaldTrump were to put his ego aside with this wall and at least go to Asia first and get more oil, he'd become the GOAT @POTUS.

404 2018-02-28 23:05:03 Is it that the price of oil has tripled since 2014 and won’t run out in a hundred odd years  and we’re in the process of getting our own banks and currency.   Or are you still sucking your mums nippels  and not weaned yet pretendy wee Scot
405 2018-02-28 23:04:50 Castile soap, witch hazel, tea tree oil
406 2018-02-28 23:04:49 You can’t give up everything for a few billion in investments , we can’t compete with the Koch brothers . But eventually oil will run out then watch what happens
407 2018-02-28 23:04:49 And hedge funds are 95% net long even with this taking place Art.  The scarier part of the current oil price market.
408 2018-02-28 23:04:17 I take the so called @RealAlexJones  's "snake oil" and I've never looked or felt better in my 54 years. And the money goes to help support @infowars who supports the 1st and 2nd amendment, unlike you, commie pinko.
409 2018-02-28 23:04:17 Its not like Herb or his colleagues on the Council needed this report to know that all urban oil drilling needs to end now. There is no acceptable reason to put our citizens at risk for the profits of a toxic product that is  now destroying our livable climate. #ShutItAllDown

414 2018-02-28 23:03:14 Why is it taking them so long to change my fucking oil ?!
415 2018-02-28 23:03:10 I like people making oil from the stones!!
416 2018-02-28 23:03:03 That sounds AMAZING! I am always looking for known good recipes that don't require milk or soybean oil.
417 2018-02-28 23:03:01 I lit a coconut milk incense in my master bath and started diffusing lemon oil in my bedroom.
It smells like a Girl Scout cookie in here.

428 2018-02-28 23:00:37 Iso someone to change my oil cause valvoline is a waste of tiiiimmmmeeee.
429 2018-02-28 23:00:36 Love kale. I stack the open washed leaves. Roll them up then slice thin. Finely chop garlic then brown it with salt n pepper in olive oil. Then toss the kale in the garlic and sauté.
430 2018-02-28 23:00:35 I have a 3 year old limited edition Vauxhall Corsa, 1.2 petrol engine, purchased directly from Now Vauxhall. All I want to know is how on earth an engine oil top up was quoted at £196?

434 2018-02-28 23:00:02 It's a good thought in the small scheme of things. But your government is not stupid. They've been researching things for a long time. With the model of capitalism the world has, there is no doubt an unarmed citizen would be easier to control. The waste, the environment, oil...
435 2018-02-28 23:00:02 Chiro,derma,primary care,oil change,new gym shoes, license plates, & windshield. I DONT KNOW HOW ANYONE DOES IT?
436 2018-02-28 22:59:59 Not to forget the gold , diamonds and oil
437 2018-02-28 22:59:47 It's almost as if the oil industry is a slowly dying industry, like many that came before it, and Alberta needs to diversify its economy rather than constantly trying to push an industry and product that no one wants.
438 2018-02-28 22:59:46 Ah bit of both
Oil and hair changed then
Regarding another tweet 
Codename Beige
439 2018-02-28 22:59:43 Our bins will not be collected, school is shut, local shop not getting delivery tomorrow, we're about to run out of milk and heating oil has not arrived. Got wine though.
440 2018-02-28 22:59:38 Right, the poor oil companies
441 2018-02-28 22:59:33 Naso,I be sure Aboki sha,if u get drops to pick,holla
442 2018-02-28 22:59:33 If u leave the gravy it goes all mushy like how oil does. It’s gross

444 2018-02-28 22:59:19 Such excitement over potatoes.
 If he could only find such happiness over /life/.
 
 Snickering, the mutt rolled his eyes and pointed at the potatoes. “Can you start peeling them? I will make the mix of honey, lemon and oil.”

446 2018-02-28 22:58:50 This is the same wolf as the one in your selfie? Came close to Artic wolves one spring in late May at scientific survey camp 35 miles from A Circle Did not see wolves but tracks were fresh & Very Large Still have an aviation oil can that was chewed 3 shreds Pilot told me why
447 2018-02-28 22:58:49 Wth happened to him?  It’s like he’s lost his mind like McCain (no pun intended), Flake, and Corker.

Is this the old school big tobacco, big oil conservatives trying to be relevant again?
448 2018-02-28 22:58:45 Never in my life have I been asked so many questions about the oil change I'm wanting and boi was it awkward
449 2018-02-28 22:58:37 Car aint worth the cost - this is my workhorse - kicked, beaten, abused, rarely washed but never been stranded. Well apart from that one occasion all the oil fell out but I fixed that by the roadside too. That's the thing with Landrovers, you can often fix them immediately
450 2018-02-28 22:58:31 He screams nonsense, sells snake oil, and is a conspiracy theorist.
451 2018-02-28 22:58:27 I forgot and wonder is getting your oil changed in town meaning getting your oil changed or letting your hair down while painting the town beige?
452 2018-02-28 22:58:16 So my grandparents got a new car about a year ago and took the car yesterday to get the oil changed and they said they needed new tires/shocks so instead of getting them replaced they decided just to go get a new car, brand new Tahoe. Only my family.
453 2018-02-28 22:58:09 RUINING THE OIL PATTERN
454 2018-02-28 22:57:48 It’s obviously not about the money. Mommy and daddy got that oil money
455 2018-02-28 22:57:42 I know he works hard but the walls seem to be caving in on Justin Barrasso's credibility. If this Rey Mysterio story turns out to be more snake oil, the IWC might come for his whole life. Good luck, big homie.
456 2018-02-28 22:57:41 Inhaled so much olbas oil I went blind for a sec
457 2018-02-28 22:57:36 Women do produce lipoid fluid, an oil that protects the nipples! Does this qualify as an "essential oil?"
458 2018-02-28 22:57:27 誕生日おめでとーーーーーーｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗ
459 2018-02-28 22:57:27 car was out of battery somehow and oil light came on as well as engine light reappearing after I thought I fixed it

お誕生日おめでとうございます〜！
どれミで会いましょう〜！
461 2018-02-28 22:57:20 I’ve literally spent the entire day trying to get an oil change. 3 different places. Zero results
462 2018-02-28 22:57:17 I missed this but I wanted to ask the logic behind funnel shaped roads that suddenly merge large traffic from two lanes to one lane. This seems to cause bottlenecks. Then when is Acacia avenue being redone from City Oil up to Golf course. Terrible bumpy road in high value area.
463 2018-02-28 22:57:11 I'm doing everything possible to make my hair grow and thicken up again so I used Jamaican black castor oil and holy fuck it stinks 
464 2018-02-28 22:57:07 Marinades are great and all. For a perfect steak all you really need is olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic.
465 2018-02-28 22:57:04 Protect these lands reservations and national parks. No oil and gas development.  Ecotourism is the future.
466 2018-02-28 22:56:39 My infused chili olive oil gives everything that extra life
467 2018-02-28 22:56:25 Maybe my hands are cursed to be dry forever because I used them as palettes for acrylic and oil paint back in the day
468 2018-02-28 22:56:03 Grocery store items that cost too much:

honey
Olive oil

More soon come
469 2018-02-28 22:55:53 What the hell are you eating for Boss! Jeff sessions from day one covered his own ass! Eric holder would take a bullet for president Barack Obama and so would Loretta Lynch! Jeff sessions let your son fry in the oil pan grow some balls and fire this guy
470 2018-02-28 22:55:50 If you are too uneducated to understand that the reduction in jobs was as a direct result of the drop in the price of oil, there is no hope for you. Please look at some historical charts showing a) the price of oil and b) what happened to employment during good times or bad.
471 2018-02-28 22:55:45 No many House Democrats voted to stop regressive taxes that Gov Fallin loves so much. They had a better plan but @GovFallin and big oil wouldn't hear it. They think we're not paying attention.
472 2018-02-28 22:55:40 Bwahahaha! Says the bot with several numbers after their name! Seriously? I'm a bot? Well damn, my partner is sure going to be disappointed this evening! Lol. Go get an oil change and come back when they've fixed your algorithm!
473 2018-02-28 22:55:32 Ordered some cannabis oil today from Holland & Barrett they'd sold out of the stuff, I'll try anything to ease the arthritis & I'm told it really works,we'll see.
474 2018-02-28 22:55:20 We need to go back to wonderful clean whale oil!
475 2018-02-28 22:55:18 They build 3000 new ships every year. So all the green programs are a waste of money.. The Carbon tax is just a tax grab if you don't talk about container ships.85% of the saudi oil fuels containers ships.

480 2018-02-28 22:53:41 BREAKING: Exxon to pull out of joint oil projects with Rosneft due to anti-Russia sanctions - reports
481 2018-02-28 22:53:25 My wife and I are retired teachers and we are going get $50 per month, couple extra trips to Starbucks. We and others like us cannot drive the economy with that pittance. Shimkus and Ryan are worse than Snake Oil salespersons! Still won't tell me his Cut? Hmmmm
482 2018-02-28 22:53:22 We should have all that free energy the last 25 yrs.  We should be driving our cars with water and off the sun . We could use solar energy for our homes.  We all know it's out there,  but never asked GORE why.  He would rather tax the shit out of us and keep the oil.
483 2018-02-28 22:53:16 I can tell u how to make the mushrooms as long as u get the white wine parsley garlic and olive oil
484 2018-02-28 22:53:14 Which is weird because it’s so full of butter, oil and sugar
485 2018-02-28 22:53:14 見   て
486 2018-02-28 22:53:14 Like yours is still killing people these days for sitting on oil or having different belief? Let's talk about the people your government killed in Ireland for being catholic.

PXP Talks With Potential Partner While Waiting For Sea Rules
2018-02-20 03:39:28.734 GMT
By Cecilia Yap
(Bloomberg) PXP Energy has held discussions with a
potential partner in exploring for possible oil&gas
488 2018-02-28 22:52:56 To the five this Eve wend. I have lung cancer and Rick Simpson is making a cbd type oil that has cured many people of this type of tumor they have many people to speak up about it. They say they've done all they can do I live in Texas and it's illegal here I need it to try!
489 2018-02-28 22:52:56 Have you tried marijuana oil you actually apply to the skin for pain relief? There are marijuana meds out there that can truly help you! There is gum, ointments, all sorts of good stuff! Oregon is a leader in this area!
490 2018-02-28 22:52:26 Please please please tell me they plowed into the pseudoscience snake oil place selling intravenous “treatments” for things like cancer? If not someone should back the car out and take another run.
491 2018-02-28 22:52:14 We do have a great team, yeah. And yes, gas produces around 50% of our electricity all year round, part of the 40% of our yearly UK primary energy (which, by the way, is 75% oil and gas). But sorry to live relentlessly in the real world #gashasyourback
492 2018-02-28 22:52:03 Aloha, Mary! This dish is known as "poke". It’s a raw fish salad seasoned with ingredients like soy sauce, green onions, and sesame oil. You can find various versions of it throughout the Hawaiian Islands.
493 2018-02-28 22:52:02 Far out, it gets boring harping on about this issue. So tired of hearing @jacindaardern talk about our "nuclear-free moment", while in the meantime, the oil drilling/mining in NZ continues. What's the hold-up, Jacinda? We're all waiting for meaningful action. #EndOilNow @nzlabour
494 2018-02-28 22:51:55 Coffee?! Noooo.  It’s a plant. It’s oil free.
495 2018-02-28 22:51:51 OK Troll I'm game - present your "Evidence".
Hell I may be a Russian Agent, lived there 2 years & have met with the oil ministers.
Stupidity of SnowFlakes is a constant source of amusement.
496 2018-02-28 22:51:27 Yes humans are dirty creatures that can definitely help earth . Global warming hoax got a lot of people to live in fear. Everyone should just do there part. And we all know there is free energy out there . We wouldn't have to use oil or gas.  If Gore was so serious.
497 2018-02-28 22:51:22 Interior advisory panel agrees to propose: oil and gas royalty cut for federal offshore, streamlined permitting for oil and gas in federal onshore, change for federal coal royalty valuations.

505 2018-02-28 22:50:32 Saturated fats are actually good for you. The problem with coconut oil is that it increases intestinal permeability.
506 2018-02-28 22:50:32 Yes, lotion them before and after. Baby oil, coconut oil, anything like that works!
507 2018-02-28 22:50:21 A coconut oil + lime hair mask does wonders for your hair. It made my hair sooooo soft 
508 2018-02-28 22:49:49 Oil change successful, it was so much easier with jacks this time

510 2018-02-28 22:49:40 Meanwhile the missiles pass.  Oil trains.
511 2018-02-28 22:49:25 And remember that when you sell finished product to the store, and your sunflower oil is costing R35 and there are imports for R24, the poor consumer is not going to be interested in your over priced product. They want fair prices according to international standards.

515 2018-02-28 22:48:50 I disagree with your disagreement. The SOS should be the one. The fact that trump didn’t send the sos is on him. This kid shouldn’t be the one to start a new process. He’s still wet behind the ears! Even an ex- oil man is better, at least he has maturity.
516 2018-02-28 22:48:28 Ordered a magic hat cuz it was on the menu. Excited. I get handed a glass of something darker than oil. This should be an interesting night

who fucking cares lmao
522 2018-02-28 22:46:56 If any other institution of company made such false claims and promises as a university, they would be sued for false advertising or for being a snake oil salesman

528 2018-02-28 22:45:50 It is curious that we only see Whites inventing things when they are OUTSIDE of Europe, in colonial environments that supply immense amounts of land, slaves, gold, silver, oil, etc.

Funny how we didn't see this time of original "High IQ" displayed when Whites only had Europe.
529 2018-02-28 22:45:48 Yup that's accurate.  Just don't need to put lipstick on oil sands pig to make lithium look bad.

537 2018-02-28 22:45:05 And, if one rebutts that Rockefeller was obscenely rich and had money to burn, he had been donating to charity long before he accumulated his vast oil wealth.  In many ways, he's a shining example of bipartisanship, combining the best qualities of left and right.

541 2018-02-28 22:44:50 A fiat currency that OPEC oil is set in. If Saudi Arabia sells the share of Saudi Aramco to china, the petrodollar is over and war with China may be inevitable with oil interests running the state department.

566 2018-02-28 22:41:58 18 year olds are old enough to go die in a war for oil. They're legally adults and no reasonable person should want to take away their rights because of the actions of a criminal.

569 2018-02-28 22:41:49 Guys stop buying things like turmeric and coconut oil from health stores. That stuff is so overpriced. Get them from Asian food shops. Same stuff, just different packaging.
570 2018-02-28 22:41:29 I suggest this has been the case since the very first meeting with the Snake Oil salesman Barnier and Juncker.

576 2018-02-28 22:40:40 splashed oil up my finger so now I'm crying like a lil bitch 
577 2018-02-28 22:40:34 Look like he put some coconut oil on it before recording.
578 2018-02-28 22:40:34 Got a new car & didn’t realize it requires synthetic oil... Man this $70 an oil change HURT

581 2018-02-28 22:40:20 Damn I’m out of Indiana for a month and a half and now we have Sunday alcohol sales and CBD oil is gonna be legalized? It’s like a whole new state
582 2018-02-28 22:40:13 知ってる？スーパーってタダで牛脂くれるんだよ。
583 2018-02-28 22:39:58 They wasn't getting pussy for oil changes if that's what you're asking.
584 2018-02-28 22:39:51 The Maybelline Total Temptation line. Especially the mascara with the coconut oil!!!
585 2018-02-28 22:39:34 Don’t allcaps yell at me. And yes, there is- it’s what he said. He also removed some of the legal precautions that would have prevented this= hypocrite. I think you see his after the fact blustering as heroic. I don’t. He’s a liar & a cheat- a snake oil salesman. Always has been.
586 2018-02-28 22:39:33 Nigeria's economy has never really been unlocked. Not even during the glorified First Republic. We went from depending on commodity exports (cocoa, groundnuts, oil palm, rubber) to depending on commodity export (crude oil).
587 2018-02-28 22:39:27 Man I could totally go to Bozo Right now... but I need an oil change and I don’t really wanna wait around for that 
588 2018-02-28 22:39:22 You don't think that would change with independence?

You jocks will have to find a new way to get rich exporting porridge and whiskey after the oil runs out. 

That is assuming we let you have the North sea oil.
589 2018-02-28 22:39:22 missed the fleshlight & oil show... hope your gonna have another!
590 2018-02-28 22:39:12 Tea tree or peppermint oil!

593 2018-02-28 22:38:26 Face it.  The man is a complete dolt.  So confused.  Out of his league.  A snake oil salesmen.  It’s not a lib v cons thing.  Others in the GOP would have been fine.  Anyone who needs his lawyer to payoff a porn star shouldn’t be Pres. Dem or rep

602 2018-02-28 22:36:57 I agree. I'm mad at the hypocrisy. This mayor sues tobacco and oil companies but ignores how many kids are smoking weed. Every middle school in the city is littered with kids smoking weed. It's crazy. He ignores it all because those kids have parents who vote & also love weed
603 2018-02-28 22:36:50 i’m just going to dance to Madonna’s “Hung Up” and cry.  don’t worry about me.

622 2018-02-28 22:33:55 Just had a lady come in who was high as shit on something put lipstick and a hot oil hand mask all over her face and neck and then sprayed all of our perfumes before stumbling back on to Pearl street.
623 2018-02-28 22:33:52 Not only out of touch but socially regressive, fiscally incompetent, owned by big oil, divide Canadians by pitching wedge issue after wedge issue, environmentally ignorant and dangerous and stick their beaks in women's crotches where they don't belong #cdnpoli
624 2018-02-28 22:33:47 Must be nice to have family oil money.

634 2018-02-28 22:32:22 I work with four women and they all seem to get them at the same time according to them lol. And if we stopped using oil millions would die without an alternative that can support the same amount of people. I still don’t see how business are going to compensate for all this.
635 2018-02-28 22:32:20 Lol,
636 2018-02-28 22:31:45 Thats absolute disgrace. Look at Norway & look at us. One country managing its oil wisely & us having another country mismanaging ours.

642 2018-02-28 22:31:11 If you have oily skin, it still isn't good to overdo setting powder. Instead, opt for a oil-free or oil-managing moisturizer (and other mattifying products) to help maintain the amounts of oil on ur face

In all seriousness, I’m shocked to see you can pick your political side to snark at the other. Such cheap name calling is putting more oil to the garbage bin fire. Think about what you’re reinforcing.

721 2018-02-28 22:20:07 Where do @MarketWatch journalists get this stuff up from? 

Crude oil stocks increased by 3 mmb and the 5-yr avg for this week is 4.3 mmb. Crude stocks increased much LESS than expected. All knowledgeable traders know this.
722 2018-02-28 22:20:04 Need one more this Sunday then you can go back to scoring once in a while need to shut up that camp way too noisy over luck and oil
723 2018-02-28 22:20:04 Ah ah! I dnt understand.. plz sm1 explain to me d tree or d flower na background ne or watin??
724 2018-02-28 22:19:57 Yea i prefer oil irl cause it doesnt dry so quickm just a pain to set up and clean if you dont have a dedicated art room or smth
725 2018-02-28 22:19:46 but who has all the resources???? lol england is a joke if england didnt have scottish oil to sell the world they would have been bankrupt 8 yrs ago
726 2018-02-28 22:19:43 If you use coconut oil on your face, we can’t be friends 
727 2018-02-28 22:19:41 thanks :-)
728 2018-02-28 22:19:39 That was Maggie fronting out the unions, financial services growth due to Big Bang, and North Sea oil revenues (which should have been invested better). Nothing due to EU, and you cannot prove we wouldn’t have done considerably better if we were out during that time
729 2018-02-28 22:19:32 i don't mean to be helpful but olive oil isn't the best thing to use as it will oxidise and gum up the hinge over time. You should use a machine oil or teflon spray thank you and again i'm so sorry
730 2018-02-28 22:19:23 My dad tried for years when he got me my 1st car to pass little things on to me (checking my levels of oil , etc) & I'd say nah got places for that.  Now I wish I listened!! Good things to know!
731 2018-02-28 22:19:20 Regina didn’t have no oil. Smh
732 2018-02-28 22:19:16 On a different note, that soap with the peppermint oil is wonderful
733 2018-02-28 22:19:12 I have to go look at a car...oil all over garage floor...
734 2018-02-28 22:19:08 Agreed.
735 2018-02-28 22:19:07 Celebrate every time victory. If you finally changed your oil, celebrate. If you finally answered an email, cleaned your room, called your bank, mailed a letter, celebrate and be proud of yourself.
736 2018-02-28 22:19:04 It's all that oil , ya see
737 2018-02-28 22:19:02 It never fails that my car need an oil change, new tires and all fresh fluids at the same time. Goodbye paycheck

753 2018-02-28 22:16:56 I could sense some judgement from the Jiffy Lube employee when he saw the state of the inside of my car then noticed I was 2300 miles past due for an oil change.
754 2018-02-28 22:16:48 I did a hot oil treatment in my hair
755 2018-02-28 22:16:36 The FDA Just Outlawed CBDs and Hemp Oil Extracts by Claiming all Plant Molecules Now Belong Exclusively to Big Pharma..... Are you serious @realDonaldTrump @donaldtrumpfire
756 2018-02-28 22:16:32 Oil industry pa more. Daming time
757 2018-02-28 22:16:28 Ye same bull shit argument that was pulled out a few years ago. It might be closest but there no chance they would want to be independent or stay part of England and have to pay taxes to transport the oil through Scotland.
758 2018-02-28 22:16:27 Great to meet and hear from Palestinian olive oil farmers @Zaytoun_CIC 'Fairtrade under Fire' talk, hosted by @ThePlatformSE "When's the best time to plant an olive tree? 30 years ago. When's the 2nd best time to plant an olive tree? Now!"

764 2018-02-28 22:15:55 Your offer doesn't make sense. As I described above, the dealership's service department says there is no 'serviceable problem' with a @Dodge Dart designed to shut off while driving when the oil gets low. They said it's how @FiatChrysler_NA designed the car. This is not safe.
765 2018-02-28 22:15:45 Random Guy at store: "they let you smoke dro at your job?"

Me: "Naw, smoking is illegal in the state of Texas."

Him: "oh, you smell like dro."

Me: "oh, that's prolly just the smell of engine oil from cars."

768 2018-02-28 22:15:27 I am in my 50s, the need for oil will be around as long as I am alive. The decisions that stick today as going to make life extremely challenging for the 20-40 somethings. I am fearing civil war in this country to be honest.

770 2018-02-28 22:14:30 Oil's stakeholders are seeing the death of their economy's demand paradigm with rise of citizen lobby to make energy policy adaptive to planet's needs and demands. Less people marching to money is making them divest. They either increase investing in oil's futility or give up xo
771 2018-02-28 22:14:18 Trump's endorsement of illegal gun seizures is anathema to Republican dogma but entirely consistent with his own political and personal philosophy, which is that you just do things you want to do. 

"Take the oil." "Take out their families." "Just kiss. I don't even wait."

777 2018-02-28 22:13:53 Unlike England, Scotland exports more than it imports you thick shit. You talk about oil, what happens when the financial services leave London? England is a basket case, and you know it.

782 2018-02-28 22:13:08 I just changed my oil, rotated my tires, and changed my brakes myself and I feel very accomplished
783 2018-02-28 22:12:41 Oil prices will never come over $ 70 due to US wells.
784 2018-02-28 22:12:27 If olive oil comes from olives, where does baby oil come from?
785 2018-02-28 22:12:20 I wonder: Does it matter? Nothing good will come out of his sudden support for gun restrictions. $20 says he'll try tying his support to some initiative of his, like a wall with Mexico or drilling for oil in everyone's backyards or something else just as ridiculous and awful.

787 2018-02-28 22:12:08 Trump is obsessed with energy industries of the past.

His offshore drilling plan opens our coasts to the oil industry of the 20th century.

What's his next brilliant plan for US energy dominance?

Steam engines?

Whale oil?

Candle making?

It’s time for energy of the future.
788 2018-02-28 22:12:04 Yo hair not thin, it’s not dry, but it always can get very tangled if u don’t do anything to it and just leave it in its natural state and your hair prolly absorbs a lot of oil
789 2018-02-28 22:12:00 Hello everyone! Today I’m at the Board of Adjustments meeting where it will be decided if an oil company can drill near lake Thunderbird.

799 2018-02-28 22:11:09 @VW So according to Green VW in Springfield, Oil changes are repairs and not maintenance. Guess they'll do anything to not have to honor a contract. If you're looking for a new vehicle you should definitely skip ALL Green dealerships in Springfield, IL

834 2018-02-28 22:07:41 I assume Trump wants to drill it for oil?
835 2018-02-28 22:07:36 Oil industry is Alberta's industry. What's wrong with that? Someone should pay for his political expenses.

838 2018-02-28 22:07:03 @toddzwillich ...base is ever more polarized and yet votes against its own interests, in defense of 2A, which all translates into the kind of deregulation that turns the oil industry loose. The circle is closed. NRA money is not what's controling congress, it's the #Kochtopus 5/
839 2018-02-28 22:06:37 I like how you add percentage of price drop occuring... what's missing is probability of going up even if it's not too high.. 10% or so... that way it's easy to retrospect

846 2018-02-28 22:05:04 Does that sound like someone the government might be interested in surveilling? He traveled to Russia as an Oil industry consultant & often criticized the US when giving speeches there. Why all this suspicion about why gov. wanted to watch Page? Because he once worked for Trump?

861 2018-02-28 22:02:21 Oil and Gas 100% Scottish but Scotland has received 6.75% of the revenue.  Bonkers. Scots are truly mental imho. No other nation on earth would hand over 93% of that income to its bigger neighbour and for what in return?
862 2018-02-28 22:02:13 In Indiana, as of today, the Sunday prohibition on sales of carry out alcohol is over.

865 2018-02-28 22:02:02 The "enemy?" Are you Saudi? I mean, you'd probably like the theocracy, the oil billionaires, and the brutal oppression of women. You also really like the idea of massacring civilians for being Arab (that's why you supported Iraq), so you'd fit right in with the Saudi government.

884 2018-02-28 21:59:24 Tip: if any of you are like me and get anxious at bedtime, then sniff some olbas oil with 2 relaxing deep breaths. 

The scent shocks the senses and takes your focus away from your anxiety for a brief moment which then allows you to consciously relax.

900 2018-02-28 21:57:26 How much would your carbon tax take from the pockets of consumers of imported oil? Would it be enough to cover your fossil fuel subsidies, which I assume would triple to $6.6 billion a year if you managed to triple pipeline capacity for oil exports to China?

904 2018-02-28 21:56:52 The so called seaport is actually a burden on Lagos and would rather do without it,besides the funds generated from the seaport goes to FG just like South South oil, I'll not deny that Lagos does benefit but maybe 4% of her IGR can be linked with the seaport unlike her population

908 2018-02-28 21:55:27 Sorry for the bad luck, it’s a part that deals with telling your car if the oil pressure was delivered to the VVT system. Hope that helps somewhat? It’s definitely something that needs to be looked at.
909 2018-02-28 21:55:13 So your parents refused to receive oil block by faith

917 2018-02-28 21:54:32 i will say this though, it's nice to see a female hero in a role/job as engineer which usually gets coded as male, but... I wish they'd given her some oil stains, dirt, idk-- something that comes off as more than just... pretty lady
918 2018-02-28 21:54:17 Double ergo....all this chaff about the "Bushmaster"/AR-15/'assault style' weapon: it isn't about the the 2nd Amendment... it's about the $$$$$.

919 2018-02-28 21:54:13 I looked at my wall and almost thought that painting my ceiling with oil paints might be a good idea

...very tempting.  But it might ruin the asthetic I have going in here if I’m not careful
920 2018-02-28 21:54:04 I preface balm
It just as good. Doesn't leave your beard with a shine of oil and doesn't stay oily all day
921 2018-02-28 21:54:00 So I need to do an oil change on my truck. I really hope my local store gets their act together so I can actually find the oil
922 2018-02-28 21:53:52 Shea Moisture African black soap shampoo + eden bodyworks tea tree shampoo. Another thing that’s helped is only putting oil on the strands of my hair and not  directly on my scalp.
923 2018-02-28 21:53:42 so how 2stay away frm gossip? well u cant . it's all around u. but u can help by not commenting much or adding up 'oil 2 d fire'.
924 2018-02-28 21:53:34 the essential oil diffuser is forreal a game changer

927 2018-02-28 21:53:20 Just has this conversation with my brother. Why can you put oil on a salad but not fry a potato in it? Why is a baked potato healthier than a fried one?
928 2018-02-28 21:53:14 Hillary has taken hundreds of millions from foreign sources. Supported African Overlords to displace indigenous people from their land for oil development. How is it that you don't know these things? Perhaps you do and don't care.

930 2018-02-28 21:53:00 This does not mention the 10's if not 100' of millions that big oil spends to promote and lobby the gov't, it has become necessary to organize well to combat this big oil big money influence,. we are simply the electorate, and it takes a huge effort 2 overcome big corporations,

933 2018-02-28 21:52:47 I mean, I'd put in a lot of money and diplomatic influence into expanding oil and gas production in the Caucuses and use the BTC pipeline to provide energy to Europe while circumventing Russia but the Armenian lobby wouldn't like a US pivot towards Azerbaijan very much.
934 2018-02-28 21:52:42 Hate to say it's beginning to look like an $18T economy and 328 million citizens cannot be effectively led by a Snake Oil Salesman, Handbag Designer, Wildly Indebted Failed RE Developer, Winner of the Putin Award, a Kracker Kristian Kollege grad, a caddy, & a fashion coordinator.

955 2018-02-28 21:50:22 They do say essential oil is expensive. It’s actually not
956 2018-02-28 21:50:16 How many times and different ways must this be explained? American shale oil is less expensive to extract, therefore when oil prices are down investment shifting to extracting it is logical vs oil sands. Stop misleading Albertans. #kennochio #ucp #abpoli #ableg

959 2018-02-28 21:50:07 The US could soon overtake Saudi Arabia and Russia to become the world's biggest oil producer. American shale fields have increased output at a pace "so extraordinary" that it could equal the growth in world's demand for oil- International Energy Agency

How many retweet for a Oil Block sir?
969 2018-02-28 21:47:55 The best sanction would be to expand natural resource extraction and get it to market asap thereby devaluing their oil. You want to retaliate against the Cossacks? Hit them where it hurts.

978 2018-02-28 21:47:06 Be honest ye just want complete control of the global oil stocks. Iraq Syria. Amazing enough when there was a war going on in the Balkans ye were nowhere to be seen... no oil there for ye to commandeer.
979 2018-02-28 21:46:59 Your “women’s intuition” needs an oil change around the time you become confused about “what are we?”
980 2018-02-28 21:46:55 As long as you don’t pull them out, the will grow out or if you use an oil base it will take them off! I’ve had them for months at a time and mine are still full(:

987 2018-02-28 21:46:36 Yeah, sounds pretty safe. Maybe place an oil lamp on the end table so they can see better.

990 2018-02-28 21:46:18 Lagos is only enjoying the monopoly of having the only functional seaport, that's why there IGR is high. Am nt saying oil is the future am only pointing out to the convener that he shouldn't preach about what his sabotaging.

992 2018-02-28 21:46:16 wow i didn't know this & now i wanna be checked too. i was actually going to say peppermint oil. but i dont like lavendar so i cant speak for it. i keep mine on me, dab it on my wrist & temples. rubbing it into my temples kills the headache i usually get with my attacks too
993 2018-02-28 21:46:04 So, because I read the BSJ, I'm part of a group opposed to you?  That's like saying because I drive a car, I agree with every decision that the oil industry makes.
994 2018-02-28 21:46:00 Will you do anything when the next oil spill happens?
995 2018-02-28 21:45:57 S&P/TSX index finished the day down 1.46%. Crude oil fell 1,44$ to 61,57$. $VRX falls more then 11%. #stocks #TSX #index #StockMarket #oil #CAD #finance #economy #markets #financialeducation #financialservices #MutualFunds #valeant

997 2018-02-28 21:45:28 havent used this - usually use neatsfoot oil and Mrb leather cream....  this is better? easy to use? where from?
998 2018-02-28 21:44:39 Yes, that's true in the case of natural gas. There are alternative methods for producing hydrogen which result in zero carbon emissions i.e. electrolysis. Scalability is the main issue here. Don't care how we do it, I just want to see us get off the oil w/o making a "new oil"

1003 2018-02-28 21:43:49 Well, several republicans have discussed that revenue shortfalls are incorrect due to fed tax policies, higher oil prices,  some increases in the economy (albeit slow)... also cuts suggested by the Gov were in places designed for max effect... etc
1004 2018-02-28 21:43:47 I just got off work and went to get an oil change.. I work at Walmart. Oops

and my phone died so I have no image of it. Sigh.

1037 2018-02-28 21:39:02 unhelpful b/c: If your house were on fire, what would your goal be? To put water on your house? Or to put out the fire? Obviously you want to put out the fire, but not all fires can be put out with water. In fact, oil, electric, and gasoline fires are made WORSE by water.
1038 2018-02-28 21:38:31 Positive vibes and lavender oil cure all...  ... ?
1039 2018-02-28 21:38:27 Of course you, but fall yake, sometimes never HMU unless you need oil change

1041 2018-02-28 21:38:15 And if the need for shipping oil decreases, there won't be a need for it EVER. So the whole conflict going on now gets to go away.  I'm just thinking out loud here.  LOL

1069 2018-02-28 21:34:33 @revpmorrison  Have you heard of Kaneh Bosm?  It appears in the Old Testament & many historians believe it translates to Cannabis.

Now THAT'S some Holy anointing oil eh?!

God gave us Cannabis & all the seed-bearing plants.
1070 2018-02-28 21:34:27 It so is! I finished the end of a stale ciabatta with dukkah and oil. (I'd had my eggs at breakfast.) Really good in a fish crust too. 
I think you need a vitamin rich Maitai for your throat. 
Or some ginger & honey tea.

1072 2018-02-28 21:34:01 @BeyondMeat I really like your product but stopped eating it as it contains canola oil which is an industrialised trans fat which causes free radical damage to human cells. The opposite of healthy. Do you have plans to remove this dangerous oil?

And BTW seen a LOT worse elsewhere. This is pretty good compared
1077 2018-02-28 21:33:47 Just started using oil at night now, very soothing tbh but the balm is still really strange when I get hit with cold wind it freezes up and goes almost... Solid again? Why doesn't it melt properly in the beard?
1078 2018-02-28 21:33:43 Tim, note he stands with Israel. He hasn't a clue that Israel is the provider of American weapons to the jihad baby killers in the middle East conflict. You know, the one we're in the middle of? Oil, gas, water, land. $ is all that matters. God has nothing to do with it.

1081 2018-02-28 21:33:30 I was feeling pretty down b/c I’m delivering flyers for work to some local businesses and everyone keeps turning me away like I’m trying to sell snake oil.

I told my mom and she replied with “go buy some cute sunglasses and put on a pair of heels”

Like ok if u say so
1082 2018-02-28 21:33:28 I was getting my oil changed & a bunny jumped out of my skid plate when they took it off.....wtf
1083 2018-02-28 21:33:24 cars are for people who can pay $50 for oil changes an not I. chances are i’ll never have another car cause they are for people with money to spare, i don’t have that.
1084 2018-02-28 21:33:23 We store the jar upside down and that seems to solve most of the oil problem? But yes it is a legit issue.

1088 2018-02-28 21:33:00 Easiest thing in the world. Use canned pinto or black beans. Sautée spinach or other veg in olive oil w/ whatever spices, add salt. Heat corn tortillas  on grill or pan. Added beans, veg. Top w/ cotija cheese, parsley, tomatillo salsa. Bob's your tío.

1100 2018-02-28 21:31:29 is it illegal to make cannabis oil in the uk??
1101 2018-02-28 21:31:25 What are your thoughts on his push to expand the oil pipeline?
1102 2018-02-28 21:31:20 Been reading more on Exxon’s 7th oil discovery in Guyana. Latest 4km away from #eco block. Drill qtr 4 or qtr 1 2019 latest could easily see a 15 -20 bag from here. CPR soon is going to daylight a very good chance of success.
1103 2018-02-28 21:31:12 Thanks Clare, great talking to you. Now we just need to find a way to do the oil rig project!
1104 2018-02-28 21:31:10 If fish oil not very good for the heart it is definitely great for the brain and to reduce depression . Reduce body inflammation and good for the joints
1105 2018-02-28 21:31:05 Did have one close by when they were prospecting the Jurassic oolites for oil in the eighties. No worse than someone building a house.

1109 2018-02-28 21:30:18 Doc, You're On "Fire" Today. Just wondering what @birol92 thoughts on oil are?
1110 2018-02-28 21:30:18 It’s basically marijuana made into an oil without the THC. Helps chronic pain a lot.
1111 2018-02-28 21:30:16 おはよう。二度寝したら追いオリーブだぞ。
1112 2018-02-28 21:30:14 Would also add that we’re seeing oil start to roll over, and a possible USD rebound tactically

5 years are also rolling over. And meaningful inflation rises without oil increases seems unlikely.
1113 2018-02-28 21:30:11 Elderberry and oil of oregano pills!
1114 2018-02-28 21:30:10 im thinking about getting a cbd oil vape pen?? for anxiety? just bc i dont like the idea of being on benzos At All but also my anxiety has been really unmanageable lately!

1117 2018-02-28 21:29:53 what about for oil and brakes??
1118 2018-02-28 21:29:50 So there were some guy's on set talking about how Krispy Kream donuts are made

2-"What!? I thought they we're baked?"
-SILENCE-
Guy1: (ROFL!)

1120 2018-02-28 21:29:42 ‘Vegan cheese’ makers: whoever suggested making cheese out of coconut oil - they were joking. It’s like the haggis being a mountain dwelling creature who’s left legs are shorter than its right, you weren’t supposed to believe it. Just taste or smell your products to know its true
1121 2018-02-28 21:29:29 Portfolio slipping down a bit lately. Not worried as oil stocks will cone good when second half 17 results announced. £££££
1122 2018-02-28 21:29:16 Before or after the oil?
1123 2018-02-28 21:29:08 It’s time to separate the oil from the water, because they don’t mix well.
1124 2018-02-28 21:29:05 Lmao I have to get full synthetic oil changes shit aggy and a bmw
1125 2018-02-28 21:28:51 What about the oil pipelines that they continue to develop
1126 2018-02-28 21:28:51 It's sickening that Arabs worry about their oil and boosting the economy via tourism to be on par with western countries while blood is being spilled in nearby Muslim nations. #SyriaIsBleeding
1127 2018-02-28 21:28:38 We and the SNP have told you separatist fundamentalists time and again that the white paper had oil as the basis of an IndySco economy. You drones, stuck in the past and clutching at straws as your movement dies, continue to bleat it out. #boring
1128 2018-02-28 21:28:35 CSR and corporate profit seeking are not mutually exclusive concepts. I would argue CSR could be considered the more free market approach to maximize profits than a “conservative” oil company lobbying a politician to transfer the cost of pollution to society via legislation.
1129 2018-02-28 21:28:35 Nah it’s a mac and cheese but with truffle flavor... like those truffle mushrooms. It’s a frozen thing so I add gourmet truffle oil and fancy it up and my friend here found that funny. Then _he_ tried that flavor and loved it! We’ve been mac and cheese besties ever since. 
1130 2018-02-28 21:28:23 Yea I love olive oil but coconut oil is better for cooking at higher heat (you don't want to get past the smoke point of the oil where it goes rancid and loses nutritional benefits). So for pan-searing salmon, stir fry, or these pancakes coconut oil works great!
1131 2018-02-28 21:28:20 @CHUPPY11301 @TheRealDaybyDay heres wat I dont get if there is  Rug pull why is Eco buying $GUSH rnt oil suppose to go down when SP go down?
1132 2018-02-28 21:28:08 Half agree. I use coconut oil for skin and hair, but for cooking? Nothing beats lard and butter
1133 2018-02-28 21:28:01 A leak caused engine oil to mix with the coolant in my car, which turned the coolant into a chunky sludge that damaged the radiator, water pump, thermostat & heater core.  Now accepting donations for the "fix Nicole's car" fund.
1134 2018-02-28 21:27:48 Today instead of paying attention in class I bought an essential oil diffuser on amazon. I’d say things are going well today
1135 2018-02-28 21:27:41 When I was in Jr high there was a kid who slicked his hair straight back with oil or Brylcreem. It was strange since no one else did that in the '80s.
1136 2018-02-28 21:27:40 It’s a repetitive saying on your part ,liquid damage on your iPhone 7! My phone was given back to me in two parts to view the apparent liquid .. it was like a oil substance. Also I felt pressured into buying a new screen because they said so ... very poor

1138 2018-02-28 21:27:34 Every time I get an oil change at Walmart because it’s so cheap I immediately regret it because of shit service

It's bad for your joints  !  
1141 2018-02-28 21:27:30 I just went to the grocery store and checked the Pillsbury "Chocolatey" chip cookies.  There was some cocoa butter and oil, but the rest of the "chocolate" was cheaper fats! I guess here in Canada they have to call it chocolatey to reflect the difference.
1142 2018-02-28 21:27:21 This seems to be quite a recent thing amongst the far right, flat earth weirdos that interestingly think Alex Jones’ snake oil will give them super powers.

1147 2018-02-28 21:26:20 54 minutes on hold with Disability. Normally it would've bothered me but today I stretched, started laundry, played with the pup, ate supper, and did an oil protocol on my feet. #theonlywaytomultitask
1148 2018-02-28 21:26:19 Think positive bro. We in the west initiated this war to steal their oil and gold resources so we can compete with China and other developing countries by brute force. Education is cure to this cancer.
1149 2018-02-28 21:26:13 i scoop extra oil from the olive bar at the italian market when i get olives and use the bread for dipping and it always brings me to tears. so fuckin good. divine actually.

Will you refuse to take funds from Wall St/Big Pharma, Big Oil, war-profiteering companies? WILL YOU PUT THE VOTER 1st?

1168 2018-02-28 21:23:44 I would stick with avocado or olive. Grape seed tends to hint amounts of omega 6 and be highly processed. If you have some finish the bottle then try an avocado oil. I think you’ll like it. Does that help?

1171 2018-02-28 21:23:09 Could be. Or it could be about oil. If India buys our oil and after this stops, that’s one less reason to push for the transmountain pipeline. What better way to cripple the oil industry more than conflict with countries we sell to.
1172 2018-02-28 21:23:02 2. As the calorie ledger theory is infantile and fails 95% of the time. When you you eat the right thing, hunger sorts itself out. Protein, plenty of fat and green leafys to your satiety. Just don't eat man made manipulated fat that needs a chemical plant (seed oil, marg)

1175 2018-02-28 21:22:58 I stumble into an old plantation mansion, replete with victorian sofas and dust coated oil lamps, and meet the ghost of a debutante named Annabelle who won't stop talking about the veranda.
1176 2018-02-28 21:22:53 Exactly. The entire windfall of taxes will go to Moe’s govt. if he wants to cut everyone a cheque, he can do that. Hopefully he’ll use the billions to pay for his citizens to get off oil
1177 2018-02-28 21:22:44 I ain't got a kid the first, I haven't had a job in over a year, and there still isn't a damn thing anyone could say or do to make me go back to oil and gas.

Hopefully this is a step forward for her.

1215 2018-02-28 21:18:07 Current technical conditions indicate further mineral extraction from that particular location is not profitable. In a few years, a breakthrough technology might make that location profitable again. Under producing oil wells returned to productivity after fracking technology.

1219 2018-02-28 21:17:20 Natural gas!! Electricity! No oil! No fossil fuels. No more oil rigs off our beautiful coastal cities. I vacation on coastal cities, because I live n Troy Illinois! Ur district at least that what it says on my voters registration card. U never do what ur constituents want anyway.
1220 2018-02-28 21:17:16 I see! Good to know! My preferred choice of cooking oil is olive oil, but I'll have to check out coconut oil at some point! Gotta get those proper fatty acids in 
1221 2018-02-28 21:17:10 used oil, yummy
1222 2018-02-28 21:17:09 Use citranloa or lemongrass oil, they wouldn't dare touch you.
1223 2018-02-28 21:17:04 Chef Louis cut up some tinsel, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was some live hornets, along with Play-Doh.
1224 2018-02-28 21:17:01 Correct. We criticize the corruption of other counties, while our Congress takes huge bribes from NRA, Big Oil, Big Pharma, etc to pass laws that harm citizens or rip us off
1225 2018-02-28 21:16:53 I dream of a Nigeria where living standard gets so good we no longer need to share bags of rice, kegs of palm oil to women just because their husbands are dead. They can miss his presence but his absence shouldn't translate to starvation for the family

1229 2018-02-28 21:16:09 The military hasn’t protected “us” in over 50 years. It’s just protects American interests...like oil interests. No country is attacking America. So get off your high horse. You’re not better (or tougher) than everyone else just because you served.

1282 2018-02-28 21:09:16 Blasting my ear drum with @trvisXX so I don’t hear these old white people arguing about gun policies. I’m just tryna get my oil changed fam
1283 2018-02-28 21:09:05 I took fish oil in my 2 nd pregnancy.  That kid had the worst case of eczema and food allergies. Don’t believe all studies
1284 2018-02-28 21:08:55 I have a few suggestions. Sexy essential oil blend, something sensory that you have made or cooked such as chocolate covered strawberries, a thumb drive or cd with a sexy playlist, A #cuddlebean or pleasure bag from @thecumpanion.

1292 2018-02-28 21:08:04 So maybe my car didn’t turn on because I had absolutely no oil in it.......

1294 2018-02-28 21:07:49 What's CBD oil????
1295 2018-02-28 21:07:48 “Edible oils are suspected of adulteration e.g. mixing olive oil w/liquid vegetable oils; blending virgin olive oil w/lower grades,” says USP’s Dr. Kenny Xie #Pittcon2018 #FoodFraud #FoodIntegrity @Kennyxie777 @Pittcon

Butter (Miyoko’s)
Olive oil
Minced garlic 
Diced red pepper

Heat gently, don’t let it brown. Crank heat, deglaze with white wine. Add pasta to pan, sprinkle generously w/parsley, black pepper, finish w/ bread crumbs
1297 2018-02-28 21:07:33 Bess!  What abt substitute teachers? Both short and long term?  And, and, weeks with days off!! That’ll really mess with the schedule. And coaches who teach health and sex ed? Oil vey!
1298 2018-02-28 21:07:32 I spotted that on boiler juice no one thinks of helping rural people with oil heating
1299 2018-02-28 21:07:30 Well written article about a family that few care to immulate. For me at the end of the day, BBB is modern day snake oil in wild west of broken dreams & misplaced resources. @TheReal_MJ_23 and @kobebryant   didn’t need brands to be great - being great was their brands 
1300 2018-02-28 21:07:28 No. A teacher's job is to teach, not provide protection full time by standing guard. That weapon close by does not change his professional duties during a regular school-day.

1302 2018-02-28 21:07:19 it is the EPA's job.  They are supposed to be a watchdog for the environment and those of us who live in it, not lapdogs of big Pharma, Agra, Oil and Coal and industry.
1303 2018-02-28 21:07:07 We don't want or need Line 3. But the U.S. government is bought and paid for by the NRA, oil and mineral extraction.

One set of ‘scientific research’ claims Coconut oil is beneficial, while another set claims the opposite !
1306 2018-02-28 21:06:55 Billy Graham was an asshole and a snake oil salesman
1307 2018-02-28 21:06:54 Think of it less as gravy and more as Dispersit or Omni-Clean for those who need saving from the Colonel’s oil spillage
1308 2018-02-28 21:06:43 No fascination, just an observation that the economic case for independence assumed a 6bn contribution from oil revenues - would take a lot of whisky to make up the shortfall
1309 2018-02-28 21:06:41 Sorry, but hashtags attract some folks more than others. I don't consider them statistically significant sources.
1310 2018-02-28 21:06:25 The way the stock indexes go, is the way Crude Oil goes. Oil & the Dow down sharply. Stay long SPXS bear fund & SCO oil bear fund! Also stay long Cotton with follow-up stops! #Agriculture #Commodities #Stocks #Cotton #ETF
1311 2018-02-28 21:06:19 Can someone explain to me why we don't put coconut oil on our faces?
1312 2018-02-28 21:06:11 It’s my understanding that cancer feeds off of glucose. Being overweight alone doesn’t cause cancer. Although most overweight people ,hell people in general, have a very high carb diet.

1314 2018-02-28 21:05:53 I was guilty of believing Larsson was a "better fit" for the Oilers or more what the team "needed" in order to become a "winner." At the end of the day (and in hindsight), we can all agree Hall is the better player, the elite talent, and should have been worth more in any trade.

1320 2018-02-28 21:05:06 you could try using the pill with the oil on the inside, i know those aren’t expensive

1324 2018-02-28 21:04:39 Any project that puts mari-culture at risk, is risk we can not take. South Central has endured enough economic and subsistence detriment at the hands of oil and gas exports. Marine hwy tolls for vessel that pass between Point Adam and Cape Douglas.

1326 2018-02-28 21:04:07 If anyone in Reno is bored and wants to pick me up while my oil gets changed and go to lunch or something i wouldn’t mind 
1327 2018-02-28 21:03:53 Cheese says oil tipped it off, and I think it was the 30 year up a handle with ZT unch
1328 2018-02-28 21:03:53 The oil does like to be warmed up a bit you know.

1335 2018-02-28 21:02:33 So what? There's a gap between the image of the AR-15 as "Freedom's gun" and its reality as a light, fairly inaccurate, high ROF small arm.  In this gap, we can sample the snake oil marketed by the NRA and the #merchantsofdeath.  They're not fighting to preserve freedom, &etc. 4/
1336 2018-02-28 21:02:27 Haba....how do you manage? I’ve been able to read only one - Oil, Violence and Politics.

How do you do it? I really want to start reading one book per month.
1337 2018-02-28 21:02:22 I pray you get this oil block soon enough sir
1338 2018-02-28 21:02:20 Great, delighted to get that sorted Seamus, Rgds Top Oil
1339 2018-02-28 21:02:02 I brought my car into the shop and now everyone is trying to help me find a new car.. All I got was an oil change
1340 2018-02-28 21:02:01 So you mean to sell our oil from already built industry $20 under price to initiate new energy hungry  industries by the oil we buy from other nations, $20 over price? Brilliant!
1341 2018-02-28 21:01:45 “Combat” the opioid epidemic. You mean like continuing the war on drugs? We don’t want this bill. We want gun reform and net neutrality. How many gallons of snake oil you got left?
1342 2018-02-28 21:01:43 I honestly should! I go back to the doctor next week. I'm gonna try the lavender oil too in the meanwhile
1343 2018-02-28 21:01:38 what is the Roseneft website where the percentage of each company as you said that Eni has 30%, Roseneft 30% and BP 10%. please as the same situation is going to happen in Lebanon the same company will start producing oil and gas.
1344 2018-02-28 21:01:36 Yes! I know there's some brands who have the oil that you can ingest. My mom swears by it.
1345 2018-02-28 21:01:26 ground coffee and coconut oil
1346 2018-02-28 21:01:04 If you really absolutely have to drive in that weather please remember to give your car at least 30 seconds before setting off.

The oil has to be pumped into the engine from the sump below as it will have drained from the engine. It will be thicker and gloopier when cold
1347 2018-02-28 21:00:59 Try swapping out your butter for a less fatty ingredient, like olive oil or canola oil. #CleanEating #Healthylifestyle

1350 2018-02-28 21:00:41 But Derek, Canadian Oil doesn't get WTI, we get WCS. So the projects are high. Right now, WTI is almost double WCS.

1354 2018-02-28 21:00:33 As a Seahawks fan I can say that Gruden is speaking the truth, as evident by Seattle players comments about him. The real issue was that him and Bevell were like oil and water and never got on the same page of calling plays that fit the OL strengths/weaknesses.

1364 2018-02-28 21:00:02 I should also say a hand out to the banks. DEBT! Worry about it tomorrow. Canada is not forward thinking. OIL is going NOWHERE, GAS is going NOWHERE! SIMPLE. WE had had an OIL for decades, yet have NOHTING to show for it! Norway, look into what they have, Biggest Sovereign Fund.
1365 2018-02-28 21:00:02 Thank you so much for sharing, @Skynationation3 ! We are confident that you will find you love this oil as much as we do!

1371 2018-02-28 20:59:14 Appreciate this your excellency .
More of good bills sir.
There should be one to take over all private oil blocks from the old greedy government officials as well.
1372 2018-02-28 20:59:10 It is sad that until this day propagandists still parade themselves as the real thing. 2012 January 1st subsidy removal, APC, Bakare, NLC shut down Nigeria with nationwide protests. 2015 Buhari did same thing which Jonathan did in 2012 when oil price was still above $100
1373 2018-02-28 20:59:08 Damnit. Gene has been getting some dandruff from the weather and a few days ago I noticed his balls are really dry so I just looked it up...and I have to oil his balls. I really don’t want to do this. I don’t think he’ll care, but still 
 but...ugh.
1374 2018-02-28 20:59:01 Right on Gary - somewhere around a hundred million starved to death - Stalin, Mao, Polpot etc. and now we have a country literally floating on a sea of oil - Venezuela- where women are crossing into Colombia to sell their hair to enable them buy food. Next time say the socialists
1375 2018-02-28 20:58:49 I hope you panic-bought all the crumpets and Waitrose essential truffle oil you could find!

1381 2018-02-28 20:57:57 i put caster oil and thus shit fell out overnight 
1382 2018-02-28 20:57:52 @LizClaman oil is down because the DXY is up. It's the single most reliable indicator of dollar direction. Oil is denominated in dollars, not the other way around.  DXY spiked on Jay Powell, oil falls.  Now compare stocks to the DXY.  Long run, they are inversely correlated.
1383 2018-02-28 20:57:52 everything I own is covered in oil paint
1384 2018-02-28 20:57:48 I love to fix a drink. I’m trying to be mindful of juices so my current go to is vodka water, turn on ratchet music, light incense and tend to my cuticles. I have lavender cuticle oil and I just trim, push back and oil them. It’s heaven.
1385 2018-02-28 20:57:46 What do ya'all use on your fresh tattoos? My artist recommended a product w/ coconut oil as a main ingredient, but I'm thinking about just using pure coconut oil. Has anyone tried this??
1386 2018-02-28 20:57:31 unfortunately it's already closed, so we walk on. "That looks so gorgeous!" I stop a little later and look over the river. The dark water flows calm and black like oil, still glittering like silver coins.

1389 2018-02-28 20:57:12 Please reread.  It's not a service issue, it's a potential design flaw.  There's nothing service can do about a car intentionally made without a low oil indicator, but with a low oil sensor that will shut the car off regardless of other factors. #coastingmissile
1390 2018-02-28 20:57:05 I came for an oil change that’s it don’t tell me about nothing else!!!!
1391 2018-02-28 20:57:02 The Kickin Chicken is for "Key Compromise" ... move up to Raki for "CA Compromise" ... don't dare ask what the devops team does with the olive oil

1393 2018-02-28 20:56:53 no! leave it in jus put tea tree oil i had a nasty ass bubble on mine n i put tea tree oil on it and it went away overnight
1394 2018-02-28 20:56:44 Things I've managed to do today: dump a quart of diesel fuel on my tool box. Drop a massive oil filter on my face, showering me with oil and nearly giving myself a black eye. And dump a half gallon of tranny fluid on the floor. This is going good...

1397 2018-02-28 20:56:38 That's because oil-for-loan deals require PDVSA to ship about 382,000 bpd of refined products, mostly diesel to Chinese and Russian companies
1398 2018-02-28 20:56:29 n, oil paint sticks to everything forever and ingesting heavy metals is no good
1399 2018-02-28 20:56:28 I put olive oil on my pancakes the other week.. it was by accident as the bottle looked similar to the syrup bottle. But you can see how these things happen.

Who knows
1402 2018-02-28 20:55:54 Thanks Nick. What you've suggested has always been my tried and tested and has never failed... I know some frown upon using differing undercoat and top coat systems (w/b, hybrid, oil) but for me it's a viable compromise on time, money, quality and value.
1403 2018-02-28 20:55:50 i feel like my bun looks like shit but that's because my hair is basically just oil right now

1412 2018-02-28 20:54:49 I have adulted far too much for one day. Retrieved insurance cards, tires bought and rotated, went to the bank, car inspection and oil change, and finally registration re-upped for another year. But it's done!

1416 2018-02-28 20:54:19 I like to add sliced olives to roast vegetables, it gives a great Mediterranean flavour. Just toss the veg with olives, olive oil and seasonings and pop in the oven for 30 mins! You can even add feta cheese for an indulgent dish #AskManiOrganic
1417 2018-02-28 20:54:02 At a town hall in Firth, @ButchOtter learns about CBD oil passing the House today. Strongly implies he will veto again. "I think it could be just the beginning. It's the camel's nose under the tent." #idleg #idpol

1419 2018-02-28 20:53:57 What I guess we are talking baby oil? Or is that evil too
1420 2018-02-28 20:53:56 No more Scottish beef, soft fruit, salmon, whisky, gin (most of the gin in the UK), water, oil or gas. Well good luck with that.
1421 2018-02-28 20:53:55 We have no oil and the delivery should have been here Monday....but won’t be here til Friday now  have had to send libby to my mum tonight as it’s way too cold here

1423 2018-02-28 20:53:45 Instead of inventing a new currency, why doesn't Maduro just back the Bolivar with oil?
1424 2018-02-28 20:53:41 I love their mozzarella. It’s beautiful with tomato, basil, olive oil and balsamic. Dare I say it but it beats bread any day
1425 2018-02-28 20:53:22 I think I’m done with politics and religion. They are like oil and water and both contradict themselves, bend the rules to suit themselves. I’m not saying Christians, I’m saying religion - there’s a difference.
1426 2018-02-28 20:53:16 Any technology that seeks to disrupt the oil and gas giants will inevitably be supressed, ridiculed and destroyed.

It's going to take a grassroots movement by the common people to usher in a new energy paradigm. It's very possible.

Question more.
1427 2018-02-28 20:53:07 Am I missing something? I see these arguments all the time in aw over trumps persuasion ability but where does that make him a good president? He's a huckster and a snake oil salesman who doesn't have the temperament to handle the responsibility.
1428 2018-02-28 20:52:58 US crude and oil products exports inch up to a new record high of 7.296mbpd in December (7.158mbpd in November), crude oil exports declined to 1.515mbpd (from 1.534mbpd) - EIA #OOTT
1429 2018-02-28 20:52:55 Thanks! I'll see how oil reacts at 61.39. Please do keep us as up to date as possible. Sorry if I'm annoying. I'm still a noob. Thank you for everything Jimboman! You are the best!
1430 2018-02-28 20:52:41 But human development is haram to your kinsmen who prefer oil as a great resource for which they can levy a war against any body who challenges them from having unfettered access to it.
1431 2018-02-28 20:52:32 How about taking on Nash’s contract thus the NYR don’t have to take on Beleskys? Oil eat 50% of Nash and then swap him to Bos. By the time Bos gets Nash his contract is down to a million ish. And Chia does this for the low cost of a 3rd rounder
1432 2018-02-28 20:52:24 Question in the WhatsApp Group:

I cried. 
1433 2018-02-28 20:52:23 Me too, I’m personally not associating the burgundy glow of my Shiraz with that lot. Mind you I’ve got to be up at 5.30 am so not going to be burning the midnight oil myself

1438 2018-02-28 20:51:22 Olive Oil! It is the food of the Gods; Greek Gold! Olive Oil goes into nearly all of our other products, we just couldn't do without it. Luckily ours has won awards all over the world including Top 10 in the world at Biofach this month! #AskManiOrganic
1439 2018-02-28 20:51:20 you'd have to break down the diets in a very granular way to spot all the variables to find the true culprit e.g. most people have bun and sauce with burgers and hot dogs, chicken is often breaded and deep fried in veg oil, meat is often eaten with mash and gravy...

1443 2018-02-28 20:51:13 Fair play. You should investigate getting some CBD cannabis oil as a supplement to conventional treatment. Best wishes!
1444 2018-02-28 20:51:12 Illumination is non-uniform in propagation direction.  Large beams, bad z-resolution.  Side lobes absolutely contribute to blur.  Photobleaching only better on large specimens.  Oil immersion leads to large spherical aberration, decreased resolution, sensitivity in embryo...

1480 2018-02-28 20:46:37 Q: What about lagging business investment?
Ceci: Manufacturing, exports, purchasing is up. That investment by people will help us. Reality is our oil sector expanded last year. Things are looking up. #abpoli #ableg #abmoney
1481 2018-02-28 20:46:30 It's fun to point the finger at nations like Japan and Norway and forget about the shit ton of plastic we throw in the ocean, the noise of our oil platforms and ships, sonar etc.

I used Chinese eggplants which are less bitter and it is very good. The hummus also went well. We are eating with friends on a low fat diet so I reduced the tahini, no oil.

1528 2018-02-28 20:39:09 I would prefer less dependence on oil and more use of renewable energy: wind, solar and hydro powerhouse name just a few. The use of petroleum needs to die just like dinosaurs!

1540 2018-02-28 20:37:35 I started a diet by a nutritionist almost a month ago, and like the most important parts are max 3 spoons of oil a day, if you eat meat/fish it should be white (chicken, turkey)
4-5 fruits a day and lots of greens
For dairy 0% yogurts, milk or fresh cheese
1541 2018-02-28 20:37:22 I'm a naturalista. I only used cold pressed coconut oil, shea butter and castor oil
1542 2018-02-28 20:37:12 Great article! I think we need to replace the "filter" and "funnel" metaphors though, which suggest that customers are like dirty motor oil. 
1543 2018-02-28 20:37:07 My favorite part about getting an oil change is at the end when you go up to the counter and they tell you everything that’s wrong with your car and you ignore it and just pay the $25 for the oil change
1544 2018-02-28 20:36:39 ...and made fun little parodies out of those websites instead of just paying them to be featured in their movie. It's similar to how Pixar did with parodying Sinclair Oil with Dinoco from both Toy Story and the Cars movies.

1551 2018-02-28 20:35:28 Hate to bust up the lil love fest, but Erdogan and Turkey were allowing safe passage for Daesh and buying their oil. Erdogan can choke. He'll never unite anything.

1554 2018-02-28 20:35:03 If you really want to stop the opioid addiction then I have the answer.   GET them on CBD oil and CBD drinkable.   It stops the cravings as well as stops the use. Without withdrawal symptoms or sickness.  I know because I used high doses of opioid for 9 years.  And
1555 2018-02-28 20:35:00 Does castor oil really work to induce labor? I don’t want to buy it if it doesn’t work 
1556 2018-02-28 20:34:54 want a tea tree oil though.
1557 2018-02-28 20:34:52 tea tree oil is really my bestfriend out here
1558 2018-02-28 20:34:52 Yup turns out plastic (oil) does not mix well with sperm....too many tails.Viagra ain't going to change that
1559 2018-02-28 20:34:50 That is essentially the point I was making. Ive seen ppl who only have 3 stones & a cooking pot; ie an open fire pit. Thats highly inefficient & the whole family breathes in the smoke. Improved wood stoves help. Moving people to solar PV instead of candles or oil lamps also helps
1560 2018-02-28 20:34:45 As always it's the civil servant who really has the upper hand in these discussions they are the ones who have burnt the night oil reading all the small print of the EU laws and treaties that's why the MPs get testy and creative with the truth.
1561 2018-02-28 20:34:44 I deadass bought a kilogram of coconut oil bc that’s the best thing to moisturise your skin with and that’s the tea
1562 2018-02-28 20:34:20 Yep, and it'll be a fantastic day when that happens, and the oil runs out, however the oligarchy and establishment will still find a way of invading other people's countries for their own personal benefit.
1563 2018-02-28 20:34:02 @LizClaman 
What's with oil??? This is the time of year for it to be heading up
1564 2018-02-28 20:33:44 Oil price jumps 4% after Paulo Dybala double sinks Lazio: • Juventus restores nine-po...
1565 2018-02-28 20:33:42 @GlamLifeGuru I i don’t know... I’m just disappointed that this is the product you came out with.  This is essentially a bottle of snake oil. You’re smarter and better than this.
1566 2018-02-28 20:33:41 فهد ال حركان تمنى 15% والحمدلله حققها مشاءالله مشاءالله مشاءالله ع فهد اي شي يتمناه يتحقق وان دل دل ع صفا نيته وطيبت قلبه والقبول الي معطيه الله.

1567 2018-02-28 20:33:39 Yes, it is. It's only been 1 yr of a 4 yr term. Imagine the damage that will be done in 4 yrs. It's like you continuing to drive your car when the oil light comes on. FUBAR!
1568 2018-02-28 20:33:19 are you expect oil bounce back a bit or this looks like a free fall for now?
1569 2018-02-28 20:33:17 Love you right back brother I will work on the oil thing for you ;)
1570 2018-02-28 20:33:05 Yep! I cringe at the krill oil products everywhere.

1572 2018-02-28 20:32:59 I HATE! I MEAN I TRULY HATE TAKING MY CAR TO GET A OIL CHNAGE!!
1573 2018-02-28 20:32:51 Materials dumping harder than the rest of the market. Oil makes sense.... metals, less so.
1574 2018-02-28 20:32:47 And yet oil shills hate Notley.  I get the feeling that some people don't know what they believe in.

1577 2018-02-28 20:32:32 I have been using some@mega growth oil and that shit is getting me right
1578 2018-02-28 20:32:30 U want trump then look at Venezuela. Venezuela was drifting toward authoritarianism. Lines of starving ppl. The richest country in oil all to get $5.00 a month as wages. trump not taking action will result bad on USA, but economy as well! trump the Russian wannabe!
1579 2018-02-28 20:32:25 Good question. I assume high taxes and nationalizing natural resources. I am not inherently opposed to either, but I would oppose our government doing it as things stand. We'd end up with no oil, high taxes, and an even bigger national debt. They'll spend as much as we give them.
1580 2018-02-28 20:32:12 He's a showman/snake oil merchant- how DO you combat an experienced reality tv showman like Trump?
1581 2018-02-28 20:32:04 @narendramodi is the true son of soil. He has guts to take on the congressi-inflicted filth in the system. We want jail to all Congress sympathisers and agents in beaurocracy, journalism, education NGOs etc. @AmitShah @rsprasad @rss_org @sardanarohit
1582 2018-02-28 20:32:00 It's fecking tragic. My husband works across Europe. He is one of a v small no of people who understand eu law and standards and specs and the management, recycling and safe treatment of waste oil . His consulting business will be truly buggered without FoM. As will the industry.
1583 2018-02-28 20:31:56 I had a 73 Mustang. It leaked oil *everywhere*
1584 2018-02-28 20:31:55 Yeah but think about adding value to your produce. Don't just sell maize sell maize products,cornflakes etc. Instead of apples do cider as well, don't just sell sunflower sell sunflower oil etc. Build a factory at your farm. Add value and be in charge of pricing
1585 2018-02-28 20:31:46 Getting my oil changed right now :(
1586 2018-02-28 20:31:27 Im so in love with my diffuser. Satu sbb berlampu2. I obses sikit benda yg berlampu2 ni 

Sumpah after kerja satu hari, biasanya otak overheat, 7 drops of peppermint essential oil + 5 drops of lavender essential oil. Ya Allah tenangnya the smells....
1587 2018-02-28 20:31:24 That’s where you’re out of time. Scotland could put a cap on her oil. We have all the power we need in Scotland. But don’t worry. Your leader @theresa_may is well on with the Saudies. You’ll be fine. And Trump’s gonna reopen his coal mines. @theresa_may a big fan of his.
1588 2018-02-28 20:31:20 Big brother, please don’t ruin Lolu. CeeC can be on her own. 

She’s the only person that hasn’t learnt to accommodate or live with others. I doubt she’s learnt a thing.. well maybe she has...”that oil can’t come out in my urine”

1594 2018-02-28 20:30:50 Surprise US inventory build.. oil prices run into another cap. Poor factory activity in the big Asian economies & $ strength are other limiting factors.
1595 2018-02-28 20:30:49 Olive oil without a doubt! But that's the easy answer.... I personal use our sundried tomato paste for many dishes; as a pasta sauce, in dressings, on toast, in sauces, as a chip dip.... so many uses! #AskManiOrganic

1604 2018-02-28 20:29:51 The point is that contraband, oil for NK, human trafficking, hit contracts, etc can be purchased anonymously. No trail to follow.
1605 2018-02-28 20:29:45 Maybe it’s because I live and work in oil country, but if you want a war machine, a Ranger isn’t going to cut it. 1ton Dodge or Ford, diesel. Then you’re getting close.

The snow completely justifies me eating like a load of bread straight from the oven tbh.
1611 2018-02-28 20:28:30 There’s so much snow! Don’t yuh just wanna oil up and try to swim through it like Michael Phelps?

1627 2018-02-28 20:26:43 it was cool running to the gym while my car’s oil was being changed.... but now after 45 minutes of cardio I’m realizing I have to run back to go get it

1636 2018-02-28 20:25:08 If a weapon can be converted from a semiautomatic to a full automatic in under an hour with no specialized tools, then clearly the manufacturer intended it to be done.

1640 2018-02-28 20:24:49 I generally cook with coconut oil, olive oil, butter (sometimes ghee, avocado oil). Canola oil is ok & better than some vegetable oils but I don't keep in the house because IMO it's not as healthy, tends to be more processed, is higher in Omega-6s (you want more Omega-3s not 6).

1698 2018-02-28 20:17:08 Just woke up and I'm about to burn the midnight oil because books
I oddly missed studying
1699 2018-02-28 20:16:41 Blocked. Thanks for the heads-up.
1700 2018-02-28 20:16:14 “Yo I'm a Raptor doin' what I can gonna eat everything 'til the appearance of man. Yo yo yo, see me, I'm living below the soil, I'll be back but I'm comin' as oil!”
1701 2018-02-28 20:16:09 There's mountains! It's a perfectly natural border. Anyway, oil just breeds complacency.
1702 2018-02-28 20:16:06 I started doing the oil cleansing method. Cleansing my face with pure coconut oil. Haven't looked back since
1703 2018-02-28 20:15:56 This IGP is really telling Nigerians that Fulani cattle business is high above anything & Fulani ethnic group are in govt & are d law itself. They can control d sea, oil, fields & farms, desert and graveyards. Governors, Chiefs and royals should obey their commands. #Foolish man.
1704 2018-02-28 20:15:22 @KateBrownForOR  When you figure out the oceans and seas are God's intended sewer and water purification system you'll quit dumping garbage in it. Not stop man from extracting oil from it that floats on the top.
1705 2018-02-28 20:15:19 Lavender is probably my favorite essential oil. In addition to bringing good luck, it’s also calming and pleasant smelling. I put a drop on my palm every morning. #drpaula #thoughtfortoday #lavender #essentialoils #wednesdaywisdom
1706 2018-02-28 20:15:18 Also good way to build up contacts for the future. But beware of clashing deadlines for both - F/T job & freelance & be prepared for burning the midnight oil - speak from previous experience! #museumfreelance
1707 2018-02-28 20:15:17 Hello there, I would like to ask you a question. I have a large canvas Id like to paint over. I want to gesso first. Would you just gesso over the existing water-mixable oil that is dry or sand it a bit first?
1708 2018-02-28 20:15:14 We will not buy into the propaganda of the APC that recession was inevitable irrespective of who was president. That was a blatant lie. Oil is just 15% of our GDP. The fact was, capacity was lacking.
1709 2018-02-28 20:15:08 Sorry I didnt mean to blame de cesaris. Think I read there was some new component in the engine which increased oil consumption so thats why it blew
1710 2018-02-28 20:15:03 Isn't linolenic acid also considered a veggie oil..? Looks safe. Besides, quite a few caveats in the design hindering interpretation. Also a billion other effects in the body.
1711 2018-02-28 20:14:58 "I notice you're calling me a "shit journalist" and "snake oil" salesman when I have never called you any disparaging names."

But YOU ARE a "shit journalist" and "snake oil" salesman. Thank you @Google & @YouTube !
1712 2018-02-28 20:14:38 I’m actually smoking tap water and bathing in hemp oil, mister smartie Lederhosen.
1713 2018-02-28 20:14:36 Still don't understand why the English won't boot us subsidy junkies to fuck and let us take our feeble natural resources and industries with us - oil, fish, forestry, whisky etc. After all they've got jellied eels and the 'butcher's apron' & a rapidly dwindling financial sector!
1714 2018-02-28 20:14:28 I’m about to google how to change/ put oil in my car so my car won’t explode
1715 2018-02-28 20:14:26 I have also built a custom one from scratch, it can burn vegetable oil to a blue flame!
1716 2018-02-28 20:14:26 うーん自分で言っておいて申し訳ない、今日も昼から仕事なのでもうちょっとしたら帰宅して休もうかと思います…。徹夜作業ってなにかのイベントの原稿です？シンステ？
1717 2018-02-28 20:14:24 Sheesh. I thought it was bad that I was paying $80 for an oil change
1718 2018-02-28 20:14:11 Umm the NRA, just like the OIL, FOSSIL FUEL, and BANK lobby are all about money while tossing human life aside yet you people complain about guns... so sad and hypocritical.
1719 2018-02-28 20:14:10 Well stated James Woods. In dire need of cleaning out all the holdovers for sure a well oil engine can’t run on clogs.
1720 2018-02-28 20:13:46 "The nastiest and nastiest things in the world cannot be fondled or even pursued - they must be kissed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
1721 2018-02-28 20:13:41 Ya know what really grinds my gears tho? When customers ask how much for an oil change then bitch about pricing and say “ill just go to my dealer its free there” BITCH LIKE WHY TF IS YOU HERE YO!?!?
1722 2018-02-28 20:13:31 TRUTH and beto are like oil and water, it'll never mix!

1725 2018-02-28 20:13:16 I made an avocado and olive oil hair mask wow my hair has never been curlier  I hope it stays like this even after I wash it off
1726 2018-02-28 20:13:15 As New England braces for a nor'easter threatening coastal flooding and more beach erosion—remember *45's reckless executive order to allow Northeast offshore oil drilling starting next year. #KeepItInTheGround #ClimateChangeIsReal
1727 2018-02-28 20:13:02 the new moisturiser the dermatologist gave me is making my skin oily like im not used to this what is this oil where does it come from my dry skin is confused.
1728 2018-02-28 20:12:59 In a tragic combination of all the nicest things I own: managed to tip over a bottle of rosehip oil, which splashed down the kowtow dress I own, and got in my phone
1729 2018-02-28 20:12:48 This is the worst because he thinks he actually understands this issue. His teeth are in this insane concept of gun free zone= undefended children. I hope the embarrassed GOP members present are forever tarred with this moment. I wish there was an oil painting so we never forget.
1730 2018-02-28 20:12:39 Solution is simple though. Just require oil companies to pay reclaimation costs upfront like every where else
1731 2018-02-28 20:12:25 "Classy" + "RT" mix together about as well as "oil" + "vodka". 
1732 2018-02-28 20:12:17 Anyone selling oil and nuclear rockets for cheap I’m in low budget this year.
1733 2018-02-28 20:12:13 Feds say they raided Bilodeau's home and took 183 pounds of marijuana, butane hash oil, three pistols, a rifle, a Lamborghini, and a Nissan GT-R. He's due in federal court at 4:00 p.m.
1734 2018-02-28 20:12:11 Anything with oil I'll buy lol shiny shiny shiny 
1735 2018-02-28 20:12:10 It should be highlighted even in the form of advertisements.
1736 2018-02-28 20:12:07 i’m still SO obsessed and in love with the white tom ford fragrance and oil  best smell i’ve ever encountered
1737 2018-02-28 20:12:05 @BWWings do you guys still only use beef tallow to fry in? No hydrogenated vegetable oil?
1738 2018-02-28 20:11:49 Not as dumb as placing all of your oil wells on the other side of a land border
1739 2018-02-28 20:11:41 Sounds like a lot but works for me. Decided to try natural: African black soap (Corium in Braam has great ones); Toner mix: Rosewater and Witchazel with drops of rosehip oil and tea tree oil; Moisturizer: rosehip oil mixed into my Epizone coal tar cream cause eczema prone.
1740 2018-02-28 20:11:39 Like I'm not the dude you wanna piss off.. might fuck around and deliver your car with no oil and with you brake line cut off
1741 2018-02-28 20:11:39 when you finally do, John McPhee, don't feed it - did that once at my place upstate, she brought her 3 cubs back - once, on return from a vacay in Michigan, we saw the window ripped out, inside was a concoction of honey, maple syrup and olive oil
1742 2018-02-28 20:11:29 But extra virgin olive oil?
1743 2018-02-28 20:11:25 I prefer my righteous victories to be paid for with Russian oil money instead of UAE oil money

1755 2018-02-28 20:10:02 To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it
1756 2018-02-28 20:10:01 With Dat digging you should have discovered oil by now.

1758 2018-02-28 20:09:56 It's amazing how fast we've come to take for granted that the US is now a
petroleum-exporting nation - It was just over 2 years ago that the 1st US crude exported in 40 years left our shores - Remember when some were saying the US is running out of oil reserves?

1777 2018-02-28 20:08:31 What is the fascination on basing out ability to be independent on an oil price, when even at their peak, revenues contributed only about 10% to gdp. Whisky exports makes more money for Scotland!
1778 2018-02-28 20:08:20 it contributes very little to healthcare. And the fact that oil and gas are an unstable industry based on fluctuating world market prices.#KinderMorgan has nothing to do with healthcare or the fact that is being forced on BC and the coast. #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM
1779 2018-02-28 20:08:16 Olive oil can be simply added to any dish just before serving! Try adding a few teaspoons on top of your food to add a great source of monounsaturated fats! Make a dressing of lemon juice and olive oil for a classic way to add flavour to fresh veg and salads #AskManiOrganic

1783 2018-02-28 20:08:04 That's great!  My neighbour has two astounding oil paintings of desert scenes by an Italian artist, looted frm the Meytega in WW2.  So far, they refused to sell them :(
1784 2018-02-28 20:07:59 ireland was in that position. look at them now. and they dont/didnt have the huge resources Scotland had./has. Your rancid labour party should never be forgiven for keeping central belt scots poor at the height of an oil boom for votes to your london parliament.
1785 2018-02-28 20:07:58 The news media should be hammering this! Neither the WhiteHouse or GOP Congress take action. Our government literally "Will Not Act!" It's beyond reason, our democracy is being attacked and we can't even implement a sanctions bill because oil companies stand to lose money...
1786 2018-02-28 20:07:54 @jhbeery: To quote @CoryBooker, “We know full well the potentially devastating impact drilling in the Atlantic could have on the Jersey Shore and the entire East Coast.  An oil spill would not only be an environmental disaster for our beaches, fisheries and marine life..."

1793 2018-02-28 20:06:53 I did see a documentary about a Syria/ISIS conspiracy. Saying the Clinton and Obama, purposefully allowed ISIS to build and take over Syria, because Assad would not allow a oil pipeline to be built between the middleeast and Europe. Isis was used to create chaos and change Syria.
1794 2018-02-28 20:06:50 Q2. So let's talk about SLEEK first! What ingredients are in the Cleansing Oil Shampoo and what are their benefits? #TXTRbyCantu

1800 2018-02-28 20:05:58 yep israel want Oil Fields on the Golan, the US & their proxies controlling Oil Fields in Eastern   Syria.
1801 2018-02-28 20:05:55 I’ve been waiting for an oil change for a HOUR AND A HALF. How in the world does it take that long???
1802 2018-02-28 20:05:51 Yup those too. Oil doesn’t claim zero emissions like electric car folks. That’s a fact
1803 2018-02-28 20:05:49 Shutting down Holyoord is a 1MT reduction in emissions. Doubling oil production is a 2MT increase in emissions. There's no credits to be gained there.
1804 2018-02-28 20:05:42 I do. Puts hair on yer chest. Ha! I had it with butter (good butter) and coconut oil just a tad of sweetener.
1805 2018-02-28 20:05:38 Koch partnered with Davis to build the 3rd-largest oil refinery for 3rd Reich, a project personally approved by Hitler.

1817 2018-02-28 20:04:41 RUBIO, you are a liar!   The difficulties in Venezuela mirrors problems many oil producing countries have faced, declining revenues due to oil glut, related to Increased pumping, by worlds largest producer. Tend to America’s needs, not Venezuela’s!!!

1839 2018-02-28 20:02:05 If you’ve had a heart attack, taking about a gram (1,000 mg) of fish oil per day may lower your risk of sudden cardiac death by about 10%. In people with heart failure, fish oil supplements may reduce death and hospitalizations by about 9%
1840 2018-02-28 20:01:59 @dambisamoyo oil consumption is increasing inline with global economic growth..

1850 2018-02-28 20:01:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, and evaded justice.
1851 2018-02-28 20:01:04 Our oil comes from the Arabs and it’s running out, so the government bring out a global tax. When it’s the government who are the biggest polluters with there big industrial factories” but it’s us the people who pay for it.
1852 2018-02-28 20:00:56 #Didyouknow Spain produces 45% of the worlds olive oil!
1853 2018-02-28 20:00:50 You do know that women do not get their period all at the same time right? Sure we've created a society that is dependent on oil but it doesn't need to get done. And there's other people to do it, just like there are people to do it during maternity leave, sick days, etc.

1860 2018-02-28 20:00:24 Fun Fact: Coconut oil can promote your heart health while also lowering your risk for heart disease. This oil can increase the healthy choloestoral in the body by converting the bad cholestoral (LDL) to good cholesterol (HDL)!

1862 2018-02-28 20:00:06 counting calories so damn depressing. Im on a 1500 calorie diet. One tuna melt sandwich (whole grain bread, tuna mixed w olive oil, salt and pepper, provolone cheese, lettuce, tomato, red onions, jalapeno peppers) and an iced tea is 800 calories. -______-

1867 2018-02-28 19:59:18 Question: is backwardation inevitable when prices are this high as producers are locking in higher prices for future contracts?
1868 2018-02-28 19:59:12 I use a diffuser, but I also have a bracelet that you drop the oil onto and that works as well! They have necklaces too!
1869 2018-02-28 19:58:44 That was the fasted oil change like ever.
1870 2018-02-28 19:58:40 Crown Oil arena wasn't known as Spot Land, @btsportfootball Spotland .... one word, different inflection!!
1871 2018-02-28 19:58:40 My Dad was a 17 y/o seaman 2c on the USS Utah when it was sunk at PH. 58 shipmates killed. He spent a week on burial detail wearing the same oil and blood stained clothes. No space, no grace, & his cousin, FDR, did not consult him on Japan. Kids were tougher then.
1872 2018-02-28 19:58:31 It’s black tea with clover, cloves, pine oil, and oregano oil. The oregano is something she added that isn’t traditional but she says also works
1873 2018-02-28 19:58:23 Give it a try. I had to tape my ears before I started using it and now I can move up pretty easily. Also if you have scar tissue in your ear, use vitamin e oil to break it down
1874 2018-02-28 19:58:09 We have the same set-up as you, oil & log burner
1875 2018-02-28 19:58:08 Have you got some of the really thin flexable filling blades, looks like you might be able to get behind the paint & scrape it off quite easily with them,Might save a lot of sanding.wash surface sand it with 80 grit paper, quick dry undercoat & your preferred oil top coat.

1879 2018-02-28 19:56:54 But you are ALWAYS hot. Plus it’s good to have a cold bedroom to sleep in......... you sleep better. Failing that you could always buy a little oil filled radiator uncle @mickjones1 swears by the things !!!
1880 2018-02-28 19:56:47 The best defense is hand-counted paper ballots and not trying to stir up a war with Russia or cut off their oil & gas pipelines to Europe.

Their military is one sixth the size of ours--EXCEPT for their number of nukes. Whoever is pushing for war with Russia is a traitor.

1883 2018-02-28 19:56:12 Put too much oil in my hair and now I got white girl hair today
1884 2018-02-28 19:56:06 I feel like the Elf/ranch thing isn’t quite right. Ranch is too fattening for elves. Oil and vinegar? Maybe a slightly spicy Thai peanut sauce?
1885 2018-02-28 19:56:00 If canned season and sauté in olive oil. Lots of spice, top with hot sauce.  Haven't tried myself but figured this could fall under the oddments category. Or hash. 
1886 2018-02-28 19:55:44 7 billion people all burning coal and oil (not to mention whole forests) at the same time 24/7/365 
creates weather modification on a global scale - aka climate change. 

It’s really not that hard to understand. 

The problem is combustion - burning stuff.
1887 2018-02-28 19:54:40 I just tried a vaguely hipster-ish new sushi place by my office. Apparently the avocado in their avocado rolls has truffle oil in it. Who thought that was smart?
1888 2018-02-28 19:54:10 Lol. I'm actually catching up on the X-Files (the new ones). But if we just started a down fractal cycle, then I want to add to the short. I guess I'll wait the news on FE and arrows.
1889 2018-02-28 19:54:00 No drilling for oil, don't throw trash into the ocean, invest in alternative energy resources.

1890 2018-02-28 19:53:56 Having no tools here in AZ sucks because now I have to bring my car in for an oil change like a rookie
1891 2018-02-28 19:53:54 Lard is your friend then - or an olive oil spread that is dairy free.
1892 2018-02-28 19:53:52 “There is no evidence that taking fish oil supplements offers any benefit for people prone to cardiovascular disease, including those with diabetes, atrial fibrillation, or stroke.”

1894 2018-02-28 19:53:30 Radio mast? No it's an oil rig 20 miles off our coast. Lovely trip out there. You walk the first 8 miles.
1895 2018-02-28 19:53:18 What about the environment? Oil spills? Weather disasters that cost billions? Seems like you’re moving in exactly the wrong direction.
1896 2018-02-28 19:53:12 Yep - truffle oil! It was seriously the wierdest thing ever. Genuinely don't know if it was fab or bleurgh...

1898 2018-02-28 19:53:07 Probably should’ve cleaned my car before dropping it off for an oil change but oh well
1899 2018-02-28 19:53:00 Have you tried cbd oil?
1900 2018-02-28 19:52:53 Ripple effect of low oil prices. Fewer oil workers = fewer dollars in the economy. Also, oil taxes primary source of state revenue so budget cuts also hurting economy.
1901 2018-02-28 19:52:51 Straws and bags ......... all plastics are an oil byproduct it’s even in decking material . As it breaks down or perises it lets off a toxic gas . Big oil companies must be penalised . Or at least pay towards clean up of plastic continents in our ocean
1902 2018-02-28 19:52:36 To be clear, water needs to be free from oil and bitumen.
1903 2018-02-28 19:52:36 Why not submerge it in oil
1904 2018-02-28 19:52:35 A4: #FLKeys 
Grouper - blackened (seared with a mix of lemon juice, butter, Worcestershire) 
or
Flounder - sauteed in a garlic butter with a touch of truffle oil
1905 2018-02-28 19:52:35 That your assertion that your ancestors didn't benefit from the riches of slavery (as tainted as they are/were) was bunkum - comparable to you hypothetically claiming that oil revenues haven't benefitted you.

Clear enough now? Lordy, I thought you were a scholar!
1906 2018-02-28 19:52:25 The best things in life (and sex) are free anyway  unless we count the champagne and coconut oil....
1907 2018-02-28 19:52:18 Go short and watch Netflix 
1908 2018-02-28 19:52:04 There are more jobs in clean tech than oil. It’s been that way since 2012, almost double now. Time to close the buggy whip factories and move on. Fire was a great discovery but combustion is ending as humanity finally moves past fire.
1909 2018-02-28 19:51:53 Yeah. But I need to position myself right. I got caught in some traps lately (my fault).
1910 2018-02-28 19:51:41 The most important Resource is not Oil, but Human Capital. 
Population is not a curse, but an opportunity. Nigeria needs to focus on developing its Human Capital. - @elrufai
Is the government contributing in developing the human capital?
1911 2018-02-28 19:51:37 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪
1912 2018-02-28 19:51:36 I’ve only just seen this! Truffle oil ?!??????
1913 2018-02-28 19:51:33 The only 2 things that have never disapointed me are avocados and coconut oil. Y'all the true mvp.
1914 2018-02-28 19:51:33 Yes, it’s not the end of the world. Was worse three years ago when we ran out of heating oil in February and couldn’t afford any more until payday!
1915 2018-02-28 19:51:28 Never heard of it. But glad you've found something that works! I use coconut oil.  For me, it's the best.
1916 2018-02-28 19:51:27 Hard to say, but a little extra oil might be nice.
1917 2018-02-28 19:51:25 No, he means he won't reply to @RealAlexJones because he's a grotesquerie who makes his money peddling snake oil and conspiracies. #NeverAgain
1918 2018-02-28 19:51:23 Sounds easy enough Lou  I just threw it in last time with too much oil and forget the egg haha it was 
1919 2018-02-28 19:51:15 And, of course, this classic: 

"Why is New Jersey called 'The Garden State?'"

"Because 'Oil and Petrochemical Refinery State' wouldn't fit on a license plate?"
1920 2018-02-28 19:51:13 Squeaky wheel, gets the oil. Keep up the noise.
1921 2018-02-28 19:50:59 I want one of those sexy, silk robes  the way it would feel on my skin after everything is freshly shaved and moisturizer with coconut oil 
1922 2018-02-28 19:50:48 Having your fossil fuel cake and eating it. You cannot  have a just transition paid for by continuing oil exploration & new developments.
1923 2018-02-28 19:50:41 I add fresh roasted Garlic and @Jovialfoods extra virgin Olive Oil
1924 2018-02-28 19:50:28 going to the dealership is a SCAM. why in the everlasting heavens are they charging $40 for an oil change.

1929 2018-02-28 19:49:56 I would be keen to see the breakdown in WA. Kenya commands 56% of EA PE deals - who in WA is the outlier? Also could this be due to some few large deals- extractive / oil and gas sector? Hmmm?
1930 2018-02-28 19:49:52 You should spend your time to focus on your country becoming fail state with its people starving and fleeing to other countries despite having the largest oil reserves in the oil.
1931 2018-02-28 19:49:51 Wow I am inferior to coconut oil
1932 2018-02-28 19:49:44 I feel like you’re overthinking now 
1933 2018-02-28 19:49:42 But u and ur party have refused to restructure this country's system cos u don't want to leave Niger Delta with there oil.
1934 2018-02-28 19:49:40 so fuck honda for not fixing my car bc it’s now saying that i need my oil changed AGAIN after changing it alREADY
1935 2018-02-28 19:49:38 Or, incineration for the lucky ones with a front row seat and starvation/exposure for the fellas farther out. The ecosystem colapse triggered a chain reaction of bad things paving the way for all of us to enjoy sweet, delicious oil. #fossilrecord #harrystampercouldasavedthedinos
1936 2018-02-28 19:49:32 Omg I’ve missed good olive oil
1937 2018-02-28 19:49:29 I'm glad we gave them headaches last year.
1938 2018-02-28 19:49:22 it tasted rancid but it was organic palm-oil-free stuff from a health food shop so i thought it was meant to taste like that
1939 2018-02-28 19:49:22 Thank god! No more fish oil taste in my mouth for hours!

1943 2018-02-28 19:48:46 Peppermint oil on my temples and back of neck.
1944 2018-02-28 19:48:28 Coconut oil is my favourite thing in the world
1945 2018-02-28 19:48:28 For example, now we are down. Are we in a down fractal cycle? Should I add to the short now? These questions fill my head.
1946 2018-02-28 19:48:06 Why is my face an oil spill 24/7
1947 2018-02-28 19:48:05 
1948 2018-02-28 19:47:58 You ever just accidentally dip your hand in the oil when cooking?
1949 2018-02-28 19:47:42 Coconut oil is extremely unhealthy to eat anyways
1950 2018-02-28 19:47:39 Sturgeon said, in a TV Debate with Galloway, that 15% of an iScotland’s finances would be from oil, which suggests it was higher.
1951 2018-02-28 19:47:37 If course I think it's going down. But I just down ever want to go against a fractal cycle, and I have to get better at knowing how to play the fractal cycle.

1970 2018-02-28 19:45:50 What’s the difference between a ‘Brexit cliff’ and a ‘Scottish Independence cliff’ where we had an economic model based on an overly ambitious oil premium assumption and no idea what currency we might have used? Just asking!
1971 2018-02-28 19:45:45 Two hours for a fucking oil change, Walmart got me fucked up
1972 2018-02-28 19:45:38 I’ve just realised that nothing nice can be cooked without olive oil. And I have run out....
1973 2018-02-28 19:45:37 Yes, I've heard him Chris, calls us the Petro Club but conveniently forgets other clubs enjoying sponsorship deals from oil states. I normally switch off if he's on as he leaves a bad taste in the mouth tbh...
1974 2018-02-28 19:45:37 This week is the inflection point.
Hedge funds are very one sided in Oil, Gasoline, Gold, Platinum, Soybean Meal, Soybeans, Copper, Steel.  The dollar rising now is similar to 2014-2015 period.  My macro anaysis says were about to enter in a similar 2014-2015 period again.

He might as well say "down with capitalism" and "Oil = Evil"

1979 2018-02-28 19:45:00 One of the chief functions of light is to expose what is hidden. If we, Christians, are the light of the world (Matt. 5: 14), then we should do so much to sustain our flame to burn so bright and never be short of oil at the midnight hour (Matthew 25: 1-13).

1980 2018-02-28 19:44:43 Not sure of the brand, but she cooked in a pot with a lid, then added a little more melted coconut oil over the top with sea salt. I never knew specific amounts but watched her make it. I use 4-5 TBSP coconut oil, 1/2 cup popcorn. So tasty!

2030 2018-02-28 19:39:21 I see the short term tactical benefits when dealing with morons. But the mid-to-long-term damage to your own career is bizarre. Like me saying all digital marketers are shams, peddling snake oil. I mean... it’s true but not good for me!
2031 2018-02-28 19:39:20 Said Thomas too and his point was they weren’t striking oil again.
2032 2018-02-28 19:39:16 Nelson is not playing with me he really took my car for an oil change and asked me for the cash to pay for it

2040 2018-02-28 19:38:29 The Algos must be horribly confused.. oil price action is saying sell, but yields are also going down.. so I guess if confused, sell.
2041 2018-02-28 19:38:21 I think we are thinking about different things here. Trump in my opinion is a fraud. A fake. A huckster. Snake oil salesman. A bigot. Paranoid. Liar. And more than likely a treasonous criminal.  He also gives zero shits about small biz FYI. 
2042 2018-02-28 19:38:18 See? Global warming is a scientific reality & a real threat. I am telling this to the most ignorant Americans and politicians bought by oil companies.

2123 2018-02-28 19:26:54 If you're frying them don't leave them too long, 3-5 mins on a high heat, add some lemon that really helps, butter over oil for mushrooms, if they're being mixed in a stew/casserole mix them in after adding the sauce and let them cook with the sauce!
2124 2018-02-28 19:26:43 Good. Now you can buy your Birkenstocks, patchouli oil, and kayaks there. Hopefully that will keep them in the black.
2125 2018-02-28 19:26:42 Trumps EPA is doing more sinister shit than accidentally killing marine life with fucking fuel oil.
2126 2018-02-28 19:26:40 and the underlying degrees are worth a lot less than oil control

2135 2018-02-28 19:26:03 Some of these right-wing Christian people aren't wrong about some things--in fact I've met many who are whip smart--but I can't understand how they can buy into Trump. He might be selling a different flavor of snake oil than the establishment pols, but it's still snake oil.

I worked at a service station in high school and I had to pay if I dropped a new oil filter,  I developed a bad habit of using my foot to catch to things I dropped.

2143 2018-02-28 19:25:15 I'm fine, but mum has no heating or hot water and can't get anyone to come out to it for two days. She won't come to stay with me so I've taken round a new oil filled radiator and a fan heater. 
2144 2018-02-28 19:25:11 How the hell do you have money to smoke but no money to change the oil in your whip?

2154 2018-02-28 19:24:15 We can agree it's an exaggeration to say the O&G industry pays for all of healthcare just like it would be unfair to say it doesn't contribute a lot. 

Also much of what's in a modern hospital is made from oil and gas not to mention the fuel for them and emergency equipment

2270 2018-02-28 19:08:37 the big companies and the government now work together and they both help each other out.  big pharma and monsanto run the FDA, goldman-sachs practically runs the treasury and the SEC.  big oil runs..........
2271 2018-02-28 19:08:27 I really need to oil my scalp and flat twist my hair but I’m being lazy. I haven’t even washed the conditioner out of my hair 
2272 2018-02-28 19:08:26 You can even try patches for a 24 hour affect! If you feel like you are always having to consume the oil maybe patches is the way to go! Always start with a small amount and work your way up! :)

2276 2018-02-28 19:07:58 So you want companies to operate totally unregulated? That sounds like it would make everything perfect. We don't need to protect the environment- oil and gas companies will do it for us. Makes total sense.

Makes perfect sense, hence my apprehension.
2282 2018-02-28 19:07:07 For years in industry people have always said if it's not broke why fix it. With that mentally we would still be mining coal, extracting gas and oil and ignoring climate change. Daft argument really.
2283 2018-02-28 19:07:03 Want to fix mine?? I suppose it helps if I order oil on time
2284 2018-02-28 19:07:02 Think I understand where he’s coming from. more a lack of confidence in if we read the data right. Of course there are no guarantees & you can make the right decision for the right reasons but still get undesirable results. Just want to make sure we get the decision right
2285 2018-02-28 19:07:00 For some it is for some it is not, but I fer sure felt a difference first night using a 50mg Dose of a 750mg potent CBD oil tincture.

2298 2018-02-28 19:06:12 Yes we should also not forget how much was a barrel of oil before 2015
2299 2018-02-28 19:06:11 Ohh I literally thought you were referring to a limited slip differential and using it as a trick question when you were referring to the engine oil dipstick
2300 2018-02-28 19:06:09 Two things can be beautiful, but that doesn't mean they should be together. Oil and water. Fire and gasoline...
2301 2018-02-28 19:06:06 None tbh. I prefer the elastic band method, and pre-laying/setting my edges with like gorrila snot, or got2b. I put a plastic bag on my mannequin head, lightly spray my mannequin head w/ olive oil AND then do my edges so they come off with ease, no residue and IN PLACE. AMEN.
2302 2018-02-28 19:05:58 Dimenticavo.... posa la forchetta e lascia a casa il fegato! Le meravigliose fried oysters hanno ancora un vago retrogusto "BP oil" ma la salsa "KETCHUP LEMON HORSERADISH" ti assicura una copertura adeguata!
2303 2018-02-28 19:05:57 I love those people ... Alberta would be much healthier economically if we weren’t carry the load for Canada. The only Oil moving is going thru the US ... BC is not shipping as near enough to demand any royalties of substance. Nothing goes near eastern Canada.

2323 2018-02-28 19:03:31 So, the people saying CBD oil are not wrong but do check with the vet first. If vet wants to prescribe, ask if there is a way to try a "non-synthetic chemical", such as CBD before leaping to synthetic concoctions. If the vet gives you shit, seek a second opinion.

2328 2018-02-28 19:02:59 Free markets can be a great thing but government dictates affordability through subsidies and tariffs. It’s not hard to crush oil, however, many jobs will be lost and Albertans will not let that happen unfortunately.

2333 2018-02-28 19:02:34 Could any snp muppets please explain the obsession with the environment ie wind farms and the fracking ban to name just two. Then say oil is Scotland’s golden egg laying goose? The black stuff that’s the answer to all problems
2334 2018-02-28 19:02:34 Easy to be anti-war and take MIC money when there aren’t any wars to fight. 

First Gulf War was just a small skirmish. Over and done in a couple of days. Over what? Oil.

9/11 kicked it up a notch but it took a Dem to really make war “ok”. Obama expanded the number of countries
2335 2018-02-28 19:02:03 So lets vote! We believe the Japanese Foreign Ministry or the Maldivian President's Office regarding the oil smuggling and UN sanctions breach?
2336 2018-02-28 19:01:55 I tried to listed yesterday on Periscope. 15 minutes of snake oil commercials with 2-3 min blips of content scattered here and there. Just awful programming besides the nutty theories.
2337 2018-02-28 19:01:52 Yeah, I don't get why people are bashing this tax plan. I'm taking home more money each pay check, sooooo why the demonizing? Any most of the criticism I've see has not been accompanied by an evidence.

2400 2018-02-28 18:55:18 A madman used dynamite to blow up school kids, no guns, another used fertilizer and fuel oil to blow up a building in Oklahoma City. It is the evil intent, not the tool.

2422 2018-02-28 18:52:42 Its important to have government subsidize renewable resources and provide alternative options. It’s not up to oil companies as you have suggested. Capitalism is psychopathic and thus the oil companies will produce for as cheap as possible with little concern for environment.

2430 2018-02-28 18:52:10 US oil production has exploded to the highest since the 1970s. Why it's only the beginning New techniques are sucking oil faster than ever
There are two factors in oil production: 1) How much oil is in the ground, and 2) how fast you can get it out.
2431 2018-02-28 18:52:09 Q5: I love this tip for getting to sleep from @NaturesBounty "As soon as you’re home after a long day, washing your face should be a priority.

2440 2018-02-28 18:51:10 Has this bottle  got frost bite.
2441 2018-02-28 18:51:06 Tax cuts for billionaires and does away with heating oil assistance.
2442 2018-02-28 18:51:03 Must be in the same way that oil tax revenue over the last 50-odd years didn't benefit G32 or her family.

Or ancestors, considering the newly revised definition of "a generation".

2455 2018-02-28 18:49:34 If you're jonesing for it, and you live near a "Popeye's Restaurant," their "Fried Chicken" is about as close to an order of Hot Oil Bird as you can find in the states
2456 2018-02-28 18:49:29 They need to do something to get people to remember they exist I guess.
2457 2018-02-28 18:49:27 We lost 4,000 in Iraq over lies & oil, every fight is not about our Liberty, it should be, but we have a National Guard for State defense, we can't expect you to fight off the Gov, who has tanks & drones. Nothing wrong with training yourself to keep up marksmanship skill.

2463 2018-02-28 18:48:52 It is sickening that they took Tribal lands initially, then took their OK Tribal lands
In order to get the oil money.  Native Americans could not win!
It’s a miracle that my family still has some land in OK, but they may still steal it.
2464 2018-02-28 18:48:43 Lilith/Shekhinah  =  Oil/Water  But, even more intense... Yahweh, exactly WHAT stirred to up General Titus’s men to destroy the temple, circa 70 A.D.
2465 2018-02-28 18:48:30 Exactly, and part of the point.  It's the snake oil salesman approach.  BIG SHINY NUMBERS
*ignore actual impact and how it will play out to get there*

2479 2018-02-28 18:45:39 Do not put butter or oil on the burns as it may trap heat &amp; cause burns to worsen. Instead hold the burnt area under cold running water.
2480 2018-02-28 18:45:39 My parents had an oil lamp off the old bridge. Absolutely brilliant. During the power cuts in the 50s our house was lit brighter than normal! Wish I knew what happened to it.
2481 2018-02-28 18:45:32 Where are the Russian Sanctions? Why did you allow three highly sanctioned Russian spies enter our nation?Why are there Sanctioned Russian ships with Sanctioned Russian oil & gas in our harbors, in direct violation of the Magnitski Act?Do you think Muellar May want that answered?
2482 2018-02-28 18:45:06 Al Gore has all the credibility of a modern day snake oil salesman or an 80's televangelist.  Wouldn't give him the time of day.
2483 2018-02-28 18:44:50 I am guessing the binder and or lubricant? I had someone trying to convince me once that all the original tape lubricant was whale oil, and that the true cause of sticky shed was the end of whaling. Even if not true, I suppose organic based lubricants could be present! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

2499 2018-02-28 18:43:15 So do I. But, I have been living in a HUD subsidize housing project and it's horrible. You have little freedom. They tell you what 2 put in ur garbage, how many bags to use, when to take it out, how to take it out. No candles or incense allowed. No cooking oil, list goes on & on.
2500 2018-02-28 18:43:12 Sucks for those Kids. First they get shot and now @SpeakerRyan is going to try to sell them snake oil. Will he even ask how they are doing or just tell them how great #TaxReform was?
2501 2018-02-28 18:43:11 They stole land from many Tribes in order to explore 4 oil. They were flat out stealing the Tribal lands that were agreed upon by the Tribes (under duress) & Gov’t during The Indian Removal Act. So, after they moved everyone to OK, they wanted their land 4 oil!

2519 2018-02-28 18:40:35 @jkenney You really changed my mind on Canadian oil - you're right. We should be leveraging our ethical and clean process to fundamentally reduce the powers of nations like Russia, Venezuela, and Saudi Arabia. You've got yourself an ex-Liberal voting Conservative!

2538 2018-02-28 18:38:17 How much have you received from the military industrial complex??Or big pharma??Or the prison industrial complex??Or big oil??And how much is wall street kicking your way??these are the industries running our lives and government,how much was your soul worth to them??
2539 2018-02-28 18:38:16 Wow, is that a caster oil plant Diane, it's huge
2540 2018-02-28 18:38:16 We have knew since 1970s that our roads were heading for gridlock and then North Sea Oil came and they squandered it as no government would look past 4 years. I was a Bricklayer and there was no work and they knew they had signed up to open borders. We are electing idiots.

2542 2018-02-28 18:37:53 Sounds wonderful. Shame about the garlic oil Carol 
2543 2018-02-28 18:37:47 She's blocking proper bankruptcy proceedings w/ the Redwater Resources case which is backlogging renewal in the oil patch & her LMR change from 1:1 to 2:1 has crippled medium and smaller companies. People in the oil patch know she is vehemently anti oil while misleading the media
2544 2018-02-28 18:37:43 Yes, Norway invested oil revenues in market for future generations. AB invested oil revenues in grants to profitable oil companies and tax breaks for Bay St interests. Albertans? Sorry, nothing left for you. Norwegians (similar pop to AB)...
2545 2018-02-28 18:37:38 How about the price of oil vs. cost of extraction of Bitumen? That should be on the graph as well.
2546 2018-02-28 18:37:34 The people who preach that they should have been taught about taxes, oil changes, and other "necessary things to know" in school are the same people who sat in the back of the classroom not paying attention to the teacher, either sitting on their phone or talking with friends.
2547 2018-02-28 18:37:28 Their should be little changes should do minister not lead finance, oil and gas , energy like positions and this position will be given to only 30years experience with maximum education. They should be government 21 grade officers. Then you will see no party fight and leader only

2555 2018-02-28 18:36:20 My mother was French Huguenot. No Naughty words. But she would, ever so politely, spread oil all over Mr. Wolff and then light it with My Scots father's WWII service Zippo lighter.
2556 2018-02-28 18:36:08 I never trusted Farrakhan. Malcolm X I respect . But I never trusted Farrakhan. He reminds me too much of the particular snake oil salesmen-type preachers from my childhood.
2557 2018-02-28 18:36:03 Dr. Christopher Shade is an American Shaman. His hemp oil is high above the rest. His masterpiece, detox prevention will come out next month. I'm beyond blessed to find him.

2567 2018-02-28 18:34:45 To be honest, I've always avoided taking Fish Oil supplements because of the dreaded  burps . Thanks goodness that doesn't happen with @NaturesBounty Fish Oil! #BetterOffHealthy #ad
2568 2018-02-28 18:34:35 Is that Olive oil?

2572 2018-02-28 18:34:27 bahahaha! Sun Sun knows the way! To be fair, I find that I have to use alot of coconut oil. It kind of evaporates super quick. Maybe I'm crazy, or maybe, it's because olive oil is the greatest
2573 2018-02-28 18:34:09 Yes, but if we pour cauldrons of boiling oil over the wall everyone will be safe. And then we can just slip that ring on our finger and ... oh, wait ... real life isn't like Lord of the Rings?

2578 2018-02-28 18:33:45 What else can we say for a Nigerian who left off as Finance Minister of a Nigeria in the midst of an oil boom in 1975 & popped up as chairman of Sokoto LG council in 1976-77 when non-party polls were held?
2579 2018-02-28 18:33:43 There's probably oil in it then

2594 2018-02-28 18:32:21 .@Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!
2595 2018-02-28 18:32:13 Sigh, Norway agreed with their populace that oil belongs to people & and the benefits should be shared with Norwegians.
 AB PC Party & fed govt both agreed AB oil belongs to US & Chinese oil corps and that they should get grants to pull oil from AB. Sadly,, suckers like you agree
2596 2018-02-28 18:31:42 Mr. President: The money for the wall is there, Mexican economy depends of U.S. remittances more than the income from oil, mining and agriculture. Impose a 35% remittance tax, Mexico will do nothing because otherwise the country is going bankrupt.

2604 2018-02-28 18:30:58 Right! i moisturize my hair and spray conditioner mixed with olive oil and water and call it day.
2605 2018-02-28 18:30:57 Outstanding point. The lobbying groups for pharma, oil, tobacco etc are much bigger and more powerful. 

Also the gun manufactures have their own lobbyists.  NRA fights for rights. 

Gun manufacturers fight to protect their entire product line. Accessories like mag size

2614 2018-02-28 18:30:29 Do vegetarians, vegans, and pescatarians every wonder if their food is fried in the same oil as meat? How do they know? Do they ask? Do they request different oil?
2615 2018-02-28 18:30:23 $SSOF "The Company also projects two (2) potential oil rig sales that will generate estimated gross sales of $11M to $15M in the first half of this fiscal year which will increase our overall net gain when completed." (.003!!!)
2616 2018-02-28 18:30:20 I don't eat animal, I don't like same tallow rendered oil used for dryer sheets on my dinner. Love seeds, coconut, avocado all but oils can't go wrong.
2617 2018-02-28 18:30:19 i was charging my oil pen and it literally caught on fire for 2 seconds what the fuck
2618 2018-02-28 18:30:14 Niggas get a beard and start putting excess oil in that shit. Beard look like Easter egg basket grass
2619 2018-02-28 18:30:09 too bad liberal 'magical thinking' joined with conservative realism and common sense is like oil and water

2624 2018-02-28 18:30:00 I didn’t know my oil change would be 60 I swear it’s was 35. But I’ve clearly been dreaming or something
2625 2018-02-28 18:29:57 I can see the logic in making the US fossil fuel independent when all hell was breaking loose in the Middle East.  There's a certain sense in it even if it's awful environmentally. COP is really only interested in who burns the oil and causes emissions not the source of the oil.
2626 2018-02-28 18:29:53 I am too.  Are you wondering how her family, now rolling in money from their snake oil sales, is going to react?
2627 2018-02-28 18:29:39 That snap back oil

2631 2018-02-28 18:29:13 Thanks to Your Welcome I’m now amongst the ultra minority of male Texas oil and gas professionals that knows what a “decant of fragrance” is.
2632 2018-02-28 18:29:12 Unless the Trump admin gave it to them like they did the oil & mining lobbies.
2633 2018-02-28 18:29:08 Lick this bottle of oil, quick! #BestFriendster
2634 2018-02-28 18:28:54 @harleygrl3465 Thanks for tweeting approval. I have attached an article that won’t connect. It proves why democrats hated pipelines. Warren Buffett & Bill Gates owns rival train lines that transport the oil. Billions could made in rail transportation stock,non-environmental issue

2637 2018-02-28 18:28:43 Absolutely beautiful ,
2638 2018-02-28 18:28:42 If we're talking history, let's look at how administrations back to the '20s have fouled up US foreign policy for oil. Hindsight is 20/20.
2639 2018-02-28 18:28:34 it's okay it is quite manageable usually, just gets worse in winter. hemp oil and castor oil help!
2640 2018-02-28 18:28:34 @femibakre at this point you have to intervene, kindly pay your brother a visit with a bottle of anointing oil from Canaanland.
2641 2018-02-28 18:28:13 I currently look like I’ve face planted an oil slick!! The joys of charcoal face masks!! 
2642 2018-02-28 18:28:10 Very Girlish,,
2643 2018-02-28 18:28:07 Exactly! I keep it braided down. I’ll add some wild growth hair oil mixed with Jamaican black castor oil to my scalp every other day, but that’s it.
2644 2018-02-28 18:28:04 Candy the petals, sprinkle their delicate fragrant parts in sugar...

2647 2018-02-28 18:27:38 Rev. Billy Graham, anti-Semite and snake oil salesman is lying in state in the Capital Rotunda. This country and especially the Drumpf Administration is a joke. Another religious zealot gone. Good riddance.
2648 2018-02-28 18:27:30 your wcw hasn’t got a oil change in 2 years.

2651 2018-02-28 18:27:18 How long does it really take for them to get my oil changed and to check everything else?
2652 2018-02-28 18:27:14 Who sent you to do tsokana this nyt
2653 2018-02-28 18:27:08 Stir fry: Usual culprits - Garlic, ginger, shallots. red pepper, tomato paste,half a tin of butterbeans, chinese 5 spice, chilli,leek, spinach, toasted sesame oil, soy source, honey, noodles. black pepper, Who needs meat?  One pan, 5 minutes. Super satisfying!
2654 2018-02-28 18:27:07 he should also reveal the oil data too so that we know how much money have been taken from the public budget  :)
2655 2018-02-28 18:27:06 tbh essential oils fix everything. acne? throw some lavender on it. headache? peppermint. stressed? frankincense. ex wants you back? hit him with that good lemon oil.
2656 2018-02-28 18:26:57 Colds are a nightmare.  Zapped mine with vitamin c and olbas oil.
2657 2018-02-28 18:26:50 Plus watching guys like Jujhar/Slepy/Nurse develope has been good. Never give up on the oil!!
2658 2018-02-28 18:26:46 What I'm gathering from this exchange, starting with Amy's comment, is that this debate has been taken to the market and just waiting on government to tell us what should/should not be. It's interesting and kind of a nice change. Let the boycotts roll!
2659 2018-02-28 18:26:43 Ours has no thermostat so we have to manually switch it on or off. Oil costs SO much so I try not to use it when the kids are at school but it's - 4 outside and my fingers had gone numb 
2660 2018-02-28 18:26:33 So you will be lobbying for a legal regulated supply chain right? So these alleged harms are mitigated yes? After all it’s the only way that would work. The skunk nonsense is silly, cannabis oil back in the 80’s was 70% THC
2661 2018-02-28 18:26:29 If food is the body's fuel, then oxygen has to be like engine oil or something

2668 2018-02-28 18:25:41 Ya mcm drives a beat up automatic 350z that he hasn’t done the oil change on in 3 years and claims he’s into cars
2669 2018-02-28 18:25:23 The only big businesses that are unambiguously pro-GOP are oil/energy companies.

2673 2018-02-28 18:24:58 I guess when you have foreign trawlers fishing your seas to oblivion, foreign mining companies extracting all your natural resources and foreign farmers using your land to grow palm oil then you're bound to need foreign aid. Who knew?
2674 2018-02-28 18:24:54 this guys needs a drum of annointing oil from Magaya and some serious prayers from Madzibaba Wimbo

2676 2018-02-28 18:24:38 Gotta bring my hoe to the shop I need a oil change and new brakes .
2677 2018-02-28 18:24:33 Maybe you can make a mini guide on how to play arrows and FE correctly? That example you just gave was good. Maybe you can give more examples of how to play the combination of FE and arrows? That's where I fall really short. I think I just entered a short prematurely at 61.83 :)
2678 2018-02-28 18:24:32 trying to work out why an oil company would make the decision to drill more when the price of oil was in the $40s which it was in May and June? particulalrly as that would be the time the decision would be taken for Aug/Sep/Oct production and that extra would probably be unhedged
2679 2018-02-28 18:24:30 I can hire someone to change my oil for $30. They can also dispose of the old oil safely. I don’t see much gain in doing it myself or saving much money, but if you can do more extensive and expensive work, I could see it. I just don’t think most people do anymore.
2680 2018-02-28 18:24:21 We know that Sports, Entertainment, Agriculture and ICT can create about 20million jobs, but we sha want oil. Are we not stupid?

2684 2018-02-28 18:23:37 Just bought gas yesterday at 97.9. Canada has to build their own refineries and use their own oil.
2685 2018-02-28 18:23:37 You can't win the game, don't play it.
2686 2018-02-28 18:23:33 Thank you!
2687 2018-02-28 18:23:26 Isn't it cute the way the two snake oil salesmen back each other up?
2688 2018-02-28 18:23:22 @josie_maran are you coming back to the uk?
I'm in NEED of your oil. I've no more left. 

2689 2018-02-28 18:23:22 Yeah so Im breastfeeding while getting an oil change 
2690 2018-02-28 18:23:17 I'll remember this session for the same window of compassion that was shown to people suffering from chronic pain and other illnesses by allowing CBD oil to become legal.
2691 2018-02-28 18:23:01 @ItsUncleStephen Golden morn and groundnut is normal na...

Its kinda like yam and groundnut oil... or rice and ogbono
2692 2018-02-28 18:22:58 Oil barrel prices dropping and spending increasing. That makes sense when you insist on carbon taxes.
2693 2018-02-28 18:22:52 I mad the dealership tried to find shit wrong with my car like I came for an oil change and side mirror that’s it 
2694 2018-02-28 18:22:49 Hmu if anyone needs their oil change or tune ups done 
2695 2018-02-28 18:22:42 Came here for an oil change and end up getting a wheel alignment too 
2696 2018-02-28 18:22:31 On the one hand Vero was built by a shady Russian team and Oil Baron and wants to own all your content.

On the other hand, I haven't heard of anyone being demonetized for unknown reasons.

2698 2018-02-28 18:22:20 Oil, gold, diamonds, dancing, models, dancing, corruption. What can’t go wrong. 
2699 2018-02-28 18:22:20 Can’t click with everyone, but that doesn’t mean I have issues that caused that. 
Oil and water don’t mix, but they’re both fine right?

2712 2018-02-28 18:21:17 Thanks so much  - I was so taken with the fact their truffle oil actually had truffle in it rather than just aromas like most that instead of buying some I thought we’d start importing it

2716 2018-02-28 18:20:29 i’m not saying this to be an annoying vegan but HOW can people just dislike all vegetables??? Baked, sauteed? steamed? cooked in olive oil??? with some seasoning??? like boo SOMETHING has to work for you!!!! eat ur veggies stop being vegtists
2717 2018-02-28 18:20:26 “Lock the jaw, lock the door, avoid the speech, cause once you speak bullshit reek like oil you leak, pop a pill, cop a feel, rock the lease!” (this is my songggg  love it too much “pop a couple xanies for me quick”
2718 2018-02-28 18:20:16 Exfoliating hand soap is my new least favorite thing. I do NOT wanna wash my hands with some weird, gritty, semi-viscous substance, even if it does smell like lemon and tea tree oil!
2719 2018-02-28 18:19:55 Tight engine bays made me think the same thing...then I found @YouTube videos for all kinds of DIY repairs on modern cars. Labor charges turn minor repairs into big bucks. And changing your own oil has a zen feeling to it.
2720 2018-02-28 18:19:29 Gorgeous!

2734 2018-02-28 18:18:03 Increasing our debts and importing conflict oil from around the world. Produced with no regards for environmental issues at all. It’s disgusting

Luckily, my injuries were only super fish oil.
2765 2018-02-28 18:15:07 You are a snake oil salesman.  When, exactly, did you decide to sell your soul.  Go peddle your wares and wing-nut conspiracy theories on InfoWars.  And, enjoy hell.

2777 2018-02-28 18:13:08 coconut oil smells better, tastes better too 
2778 2018-02-28 18:12:58 I like the Razzle Dazzle bath oil from lush. It's not a bath bomb technically... but I like it better than most bath bombs I've tried. It still makes the water pretty as it dissolves like a bomb, smells good, and leaves your skin feeling like it's covered in lotion.
2779 2018-02-28 18:12:52 I used to change my own oil on all my vehicles but the cost began getting more and more expensive for DIY.  Plus getting rid of the waste was becoming harder and a bigger task each time.  So glad @RicksTorrance offers good service and affordable coupons to offset my time.

2785 2018-02-28 18:12:33 Just had a press release from a company stating taking fish oil supplements when pregnant, reduces chances of food allergy in resulting children. However, it fails to note that the NHS advises avoidance of fish oils supplements due to vitamin A risks. #badscience
2786 2018-02-28 18:12:27 Overheard at #embeddedworld2018 “Data is not the new oil. It is the new asbestos.” Makes you think.
2787 2018-02-28 18:12:25 I’m actually cooking. And enjoying it! I’m making roasted cauliflower/mushroom soup in an Instant Pot (that I won!!). After that’s done, I’m going to steam some artichokes & then sauté them in olive oil with garlic.
2788 2018-02-28 18:12:20 I get it.  Electric cars are coming - but I prefer a V-8.  Support those oil drillers and their families rather than Obama's G.E.

2808 2018-02-28 18:09:45 In times past that may have been true. But the economy reacts in real time now. When the economy was easily read the indicators where oil, housing, money prices. But the libor scandal changed all that.
2809 2018-02-28 18:09:42 no i mean i only used coconut oil to ruin my legs, i use conditioner quite often actually lol
2810 2018-02-28 18:09:41 U.S. oil production surged to an all-time high above 10 million barrels a day in November.
2811 2018-02-28 18:09:40 I can tell you what I stand for. Increased funding for rural hospitals, a major focus on public education, including higher teacher pay and less standardized testing, expanded voting rights, and integration of alternative energy solutions in the oil and gas industry.

2816 2018-02-28 18:08:44 Leaving for Florida next week and I just had to pay my last tuition payment for the semester that was like $400 and today I took my car in for an oil change only to find out there’s a leak in my water pump so there goes another $400. If this isn’t adulting idk what is 
2817 2018-02-28 18:08:38 If napping outdoors in February on a park bench at the auto service place while they change my car’s oil is wrong, I don’t wanna be right.
2818 2018-02-28 18:08:38 Really? A snake oil salesman!
2819 2018-02-28 18:08:25 Wondering if @chefsymon has a tomato-free pasta dish. Our daughter has a contact allergy to tomatoes, and always gets a bland, oil & garlic butter sauce on her pasta when the rest of the house is enjoying a meaty, flavorful red sauce.

2821 2018-02-28 18:08:12 Agree with Paul. We are open with the idea that mineral oil gets distorted. But we have seen results in reducing use of high EIQ products that have been shown to be harmful ecologically otherwise

2839 2018-02-28 18:06:02 Fyi, liberals don't have issues with large corporations. Their issue is with the idea that they bribe politicians to make things work in their favor. Drug companies, oil & gas companies, banks....
2840 2018-02-28 18:05:58 That eco style with the black castor oil n shit did absolutely nothing for my hair. I'll stick to the olive oil one.

2843 2018-02-28 18:05:45 The way I was taught was to boil your rice then let it cool, put a little oil in your frying pan once it’s hot add some beaten eggs and let them cook through then add your rice, some pre cooked chicken/prawns etc and add soy sauce and mix together make sure
2844 2018-02-28 18:05:45 Socialism is ok as long as it benefits the oil or gun industries.
2845 2018-02-28 18:05:35 Have you been burning the midnight oil, @mlp_MedliC? I'm eager to hear what you have been working on.

2847 2018-02-28 18:05:19 Describing how something works does not mean that thing is working correctly, nor does it mean it was intended to work that way.  Heck, my neighbor says his car drives just fine with the low oil warning light on.  I guess he should drive it faster, right?
2848 2018-02-28 18:05:03 i'm having an emergency that definitely doesn't have to do anything with the fact that you can get retroactively high if you take solid infused coconut oil before going to bed 
2849 2018-02-28 18:05:00 I dread getting an oil change because my car is literally breaking down piece by piece and they always try to eff my life up by telling me the cost to repair it all........ and they hardcore judge me...
2850 2018-02-28 18:04:54 @Boilerjuice 3rd party sales = 3rd party service.Shame on you no oil and still no notification of not being deivered. Don’t use/order fuel.
2851 2018-02-28 18:04:46 When you are young you do not understand how politics is mostly about curbing power. Venezuela nationalized the oil industries and gave them to be run by socialist cronies who know nothing about business. After Venezuela’s downfall watch the rulers blame the people again.

2854 2018-02-28 18:04:36 I noticed I cut out a lot of conversations at work that served neither: my happiness, my productivity. I allowed my two jobs to make more demands on my time and increased speed of tasks. I started taking spoonfuls of fish oil.

2870 2018-02-28 18:03:03 Guys please remember oil is not a moisturiser. There’s no water in oil so make sure you’re using a water-based moisturiser before you put the oil in. Oil’s there to seal in moisture and stop water evaporating as quickly.

2873 2018-02-28 18:02:52 Too late. The oil is declining and renewable will replace in the next decade. Global warming will intensify and no water for development. 50 percent of Iran will be inhabitable in a couple of decades if these incompetent thieves are not removed.

2877 2018-02-28 18:02:23 Q4 GDP was revised lower, while housing and regional manufacturing reports severely missed. Booking Holdings is higher and Lowe's Companies is down following their earnings. Crude oil prices are lower and gold is flat. Asia was down and Europe is recovering.
2878 2018-02-28 18:02:21 Absolutely. Uninterrupted electricity at lower prices wud help even rural side. India is blessed to hv almost 365 days a yr sunlight and we must harness that to reduce our dependence on oil&gas. Battery storage technologies rimproving a lot and scaling cud bring down its prices.

2881 2018-02-28 18:01:38 billy graham was a racist, sexist bigot that thwarted social progress in this country for decades so he could sell his “fire and brimstone” snake oil. the fact that US presidents gave that relic the time of day shows just how far we’ve yet to go. good riddance.

2886 2018-02-28 18:01:26 I agree it gets harder for the Oil.  I am curious if Calgary fans have their sphincters as tight because I am sure they expected to be a lot higher as well... especially with the Oil being as shitty as they are this year

One day will not make a difference if you go back to shopping and shipping with them tomorrow. A lot of people paid for Amazon Prime.  A boycott only hurts their wallet.

3086 2018-02-28 17:36:12 USA imperialist regime change agenda for Syria:

We want to appropriate Syria's oil fields.
We want to partition and balkanize Syria. 
We want to march to Damascus and topple Assad.
We want to stay in Syria permanently.
3087 2018-02-28 17:36:11 Things I love about China:
1. How quiet it is at night (when the fireworks aren’t going off)

Things I absolutely can’t stand but have to bc I’m living here:
1. It’s not the smog, the sewer or even the cigarette smoke; it’s the cooking oil smell that won’t leave my clothes.
3088 2018-02-28 17:36:03 Ima oil myself up like a WWE superstar when i hit up these beaches & pool parties
3089 2018-02-28 17:36:01 most of the time it just looks like they're using oil paints. like i know i can't be sure but i still always have to think of that

3095 2018-02-28 17:35:28 Interesting correlation between that and the world oil price. Just throwing that out there for you Jason. Please make us a video of what you would say to the Saudi and American govs if you had a chance.
3096 2018-02-28 17:35:26 Oil production:
Russia: 10.905 MMb/d
US: 10.283 MMb/d
Saudi: 9.983 MMb/d
3097 2018-02-28 17:35:24 I remember in the late 70’s our primary school closed for a week as the lorries couldn’t get up the hills to deliver the heating oil.  Ended up with burst pipes and they then bussed us to a neighbouring school while it got fixed.  Fun times!
3098 2018-02-28 17:35:00 Think i'll print that one off, you're in for a shock (either that or you're obfuscating somewhat) 
Oh, the oil was always a bonus, that's why our economy grew when the price fell
3099 2018-02-28 17:35:00 Compared to the pollution from mining coal and oil spills this is zilch and you know it

3108 2018-02-28 17:34:18 Maybe there are special interest groups from US who works behind the scene to keep our oil price low?  Why not buy your raw products @ 40% discount ship to your door then process it and sell it for more?
3109 2018-02-28 17:34:17 $60 for a fucking oil change

3112 2018-02-28 17:33:49 It was also a reminder that Christianity has been manipulated by racist, homophobic, and intolerant snake oil salesmen like Graham.  If Billy Graham was a Muslim and did what he did in the name of Islam, he would've been arrested.

3120 2018-02-28 17:32:49 True. She thinks coconut oil is healthy. A lot of people do, apparently. I found a health food delivery service that uses coconut oil in a lot of things. Makes the fat content sky high. Of course, they also push the keto diet, so what do they know.

3123 2018-02-28 17:32:31 I need someone to change my oil. Would you be so kind? It goes in through here... *spreads legs*
3124 2018-02-28 17:32:16 It’s still less than the $108 price around the time of the Indyref  white paper in 2013 and volumes of oil being produced by North Sea are also falling.

3126 2018-02-28 17:32:13 Most of our imports from China is electronics and electrical goods. Adding to the skyrocketing trade deficit;  which stands more than $46 billion now! You are right Sir, matter of time when electronics will replace oil for the number one contributor for dollar outflows!

3128 2018-02-28 17:32:07 I find it appalling a hateful bigot like Billy Graham is being laid out in the U.S. capitol to be honored as if he did anything to benefit our country. He was nothing more than a snake oil salesman who bilked the gullible out of their money while poisoning their hearts & minds.

3136 2018-02-28 17:31:11 No there are NOT 1000s of scientific papers saying the opposite.  That is simply untrue.  There are websites funded by oil companies that spin this particular lie, and a handful of dissenting scientists, but no evidence to back them up.

3145 2018-02-28 17:30:14 Two ways to become number 1 oil producer:
1. Increase your production compared to the competitors
2. Decrease the production of the competitors.

Which is going to be followed? Both will yield the same result.
3146 2018-02-28 17:30:11 The oil runs over your head despite how you feel.
3147 2018-02-28 17:30:07 Isn't this oil?

3162 2018-02-28 17:28:26 @honeycrisp @judofuse are both right. Thighs are amazing on the grill straight up (olive oil, salt, pepper). Chicken breast is over-rated and usually needs help (sauce, dry rub, breading, etc.) to be truly tasty.

3166 2018-02-28 17:28:03 Doesn't appear to have worked well for Scotland when you think both countries started from the same square on the discovery of oil. But decades of Westminster scheming HAVE been funded: specifically, unearned income for Rent-seekers - the extractors of wealth created by others.

In any event, I wouldn’t trust Russia’s “help”.
Their “help” so far in NK has consisted of violating the existing sanctions re:coal, oil.

3213 2018-02-28 17:22:35 Right? They even opened the hood and showed my 5-year-old daughter how to check the oil level. I mean....

3367 2018-02-28 17:04:00 Curse all those "#consulting" companies that sell BS solutions for "fixing" struggling companies, and the #HumanResources and management fools who think that snake oil is a good idea. Still a little traumatized about those activities from the past.
3368 2018-02-28 17:03:52 Im wondering how @davidhogg111 's neck supports his fat head. Perhaps he needs that "snake oil".
3369 2018-02-28 17:03:38 Imagine a society where curing cancer, diabetes and arthritis with cannabis oil was not illegal and instead paid for by societal funds. CANNABIS IS THE MOST POWERFUL MEDICINE IN THE WORLD. Paraditopia is a society where everyone can heal themselves with cannabis for free. <3! =)!

3415 2018-02-28 16:59:21 The other dimension is that a handful of extremely conservative industries (like oil) tend to set the tone when in fact there is a slight left-lean tendency among executives in most big corporations

You are what would be described as a snake oil salesmen.

3432 2018-02-28 16:57:23 I just googled it to see if it was a business (maybe reminding me to get an oil change or something, idk what I thought)
3433 2018-02-28 16:57:16 Oil rolled over. Took a little longer than I though, which is typical for commodities.
3434 2018-02-28 16:57:10 I use coconut oil as just my regular lotion and it makes my nails look great by default
3435 2018-02-28 16:57:05 Heid is waiting.....lets see if you are right. Must be one soon though.
3436 2018-02-28 16:57:01 Of course it is but he's not responsible for the negotiations so putting more oil on the fire is the purpose of opposition well done actually even if it was nonsense
3437 2018-02-28 16:56:50 The oil companies refused fueling up, in fear of sanctions from the US. But our German government found a solution and ordered our army to help out. :-(

3441 2018-02-28 16:55:32 Throw the oil industry under the bus? I think you're talking to the wrong guy, I've been advocating for it for years. Trudeau and Horgan are the obstructionists, backed by the eco fanatics in BC.
3442 2018-02-28 16:55:24 @bbc5live Plastic free goods, GREAT. But if you have shares in a petro/oil company, now might be a good time to sell? @RobinRedshanks1
3443 2018-02-28 16:55:20 The premier did not trigger a trade war with Alberta. You as leader of the opposition should concern yourself with BC ‘s interest and not flanking for US dirty oil corporations
3444 2018-02-28 16:55:15 He’s no different than our corrupt politicians that send our service men and women into harms way to protect oil and opium, and then leave them high and dry once their used up, yet they still get their lifetime pension and benefits package after one term!

3487 2018-02-28 16:50:36 Guess that’s one way to guarantee none of it will be built, as the WHOLE wall will never happen. I can support that! And if it’s built, are you going to have stations set-up where we can pour boiling oil down on those on the other side? They did that in the Middle Ages too!

3507 2018-02-28 16:48:29 V-commerce?    Ugh.    Reminds me of how cool it seemed when my dad's 1985 Chrysler Laser would warble:   "Engine oil pressure is above normal, engine damage may occur"   when a red light was all that was required.

3511 2018-02-28 16:48:12 Don’t make appointments for oil changes you’ll end up sitting here watching these fucks do nothing for 35 minutes
3512 2018-02-28 16:48:03 Pessimistic? Could be, but I defy you to prove me wrong...and I'm an oil BULL!
3513 2018-02-28 16:47:52 We tax milk & bread, but not oil & gas
We ignore racism, but embrace nepotism & cronyism
We subsidize global companies, but ignore small businesses.
We're the worst, because we refuse to do better.

3515 2018-02-28 16:47:47 it’s really thick so it probably loosens as it’s heated. so just castor oil and a few drops of essential oils?
3516 2018-02-28 16:47:16 Separators: 

-Pita has to have a somewhat crisp texture and a slightly buttery (or oil) flavor. Meh pita...it’s a “no” for me, dog

-And no dog treat “gyro meat” strips.  Gotta shave it from the rotisserie or GTFO
3517 2018-02-28 16:47:02 Nope tapi highly recommended for oily skin. I pakai neutrogena oil free for my combi skin type :)
3518 2018-02-28 16:47:02 Meh. Let them worry about “follower counts”. If they think that’s what socials about, they’re burning oil IMO...
3519 2018-02-28 16:46:57 Funds are closing, commodity desks are closing, analysts are fleeing, in favour of tech coverage.  Nobody but oil bugs knows anything about oil, and the market, beyond hearing the daily closing price, in passing, and the odd "shale will flood the market", or "EV's are the future"

3521 2018-02-28 16:46:51 You do know, right, that people who are ACTUALLY successful don’t need to tell people that they are successful?
You are a fraud & a snake oil salesman & the only people who believe anything you say are too stupid to know otherwise, or too selfish to care.
3522 2018-02-28 16:46:50 Tbh i just used a couple of drops cause i have sensitive skin especially to tea tree oil, also u don’t need as much castor oil for the base as you’d think, i wayyyy over estimated lmao

3524 2018-02-28 16:46:43 Someone just wrote this comment on my website:
"What happened to oil sky rocket?"
Does anyone use "sky rocket" as a noun? I never have and can't recall ever hearing it used. Why is the verb form common? I suggest avoiding it along with "game changer." What game?
3525 2018-02-28 16:46:20 Whether people like @Wickes or not, my go to 'safe as houses' woodwork paint has always been their waterbased primer undercoat and oil based eggshell or oil based liquid gloss... has never let me down in the 10 years I've used them... #HorsesForCourses #IfItAintBroke
3526 2018-02-28 16:46:19 "There were no substantial differences in the frequency of servings per week for cereals, fruits & vegetables, potatoes, sweets, & olive oil." 

Eggs & dairy act like other meats. If this were a Med diet vs. a whole plant-based diet, there likely would've been clear differences.
3527 2018-02-28 16:46:19 We can't stop supporting the militants in the Middle East unless Saudi Arabia will stop thinking about putting Saudi Aramco, their oil company, on the US stock market and sell to China, thereby ruining the US-Saudi petrodollar deal and giving China the hegemonic ball to run with.

3530 2018-02-28 16:46:02 Even wilder, it was mostly used for the oil (think about the random maniac who decided 'let's crush up a bunch of radish seeds) before becoming human food
3531 2018-02-28 16:46:00 Either way, I'm beyond grateful that you share FE and arrows with us, and talk fundamentals.
3532 2018-02-28 16:45:47 I use organic jbco but haven’t mixed it with anything as a hot oil treatment yet! Do you just use equal parts of everything or like..?
3533 2018-02-28 16:45:45 A travesty of the Separation of Church and State. That we honor a Snake Oil Salesman, that made (Tax Free) millions in personal wealth by stealing old people pentions
3534 2018-02-28 16:45:27 I personally HATE coconut oil and it makes my skin feel disgusting and even more oily than it already is

3537 2018-02-28 16:45:15 Yeah but like shorting oil at like 1min before stats is not that smart of a trade. That was what I was saying =)
3538 2018-02-28 16:45:14 I never understood why Ireland have been able to be independent and on theirs own, but not Scotland, i mean you have the means, Oil & Gas + others things.
Anyway it is never too late if Brexit hurt too much a way will be found to independence.Nicola Rocks.
3539 2018-02-28 16:45:11 Did you know that 4am is when your baby’s temperature is at its lowest. So make sure they are cosy in this cold weather. Try an thermostatically controlled oil filled radiator set at 19-20 degrees. This will help with night wakings especially early morning ones!

3541 2018-02-28 16:45:04 None, I would posit, but, if you want to discount history, why are you still citing the 80's oil boom as an argument for Indy?
3542 2018-02-28 16:45:02 I understand. It helps but I make the mistake of waiting for big blue (up or down) OR for FE to be in the 90s before ending and starting positions. That's where I fall short. I understand the trolls and that problem. Maybe there is a way we can figure it out to avoid the trolls?
3543 2018-02-28 16:44:58 #BillyGraham was a racist, woman-hating, snake oil selling con man who duped his ignorant followers out of millions, but was praised bc it was in the name of religion. I'm glad he's dead.
3544 2018-02-28 16:44:43 I think part of it is they don't fully drain the oil off of the Wings.. When I've done that at home it seems to come closer to their sauce

3573 2018-02-28 16:41:44 Easy!! One with loads of oil! That's what America & the UK do. Iraq, Iran, Libya. Either war or sanctions. The only reason USA & the UK government haven't stepped in Syria is there ain't enough oil or the tanks would have rolled in ages ago!!!

3578 2018-02-28 16:41:02 Why do these shooters wear military gear when they do these things? Why do most drawn on a combat mindset? Because they, like our communities and our country have declared war and defined enemies worthy to die. Be it for oil, for slight, for $ in the streets or in FY 201x budget.

3641 2018-02-28 16:34:16 Not on purpose but I always make a money drawing oil during an Earth full moon.

3657 2018-02-28 16:33:15 However when Thatcher got in she had to deal with 79 oil shock but compounded the high unemployment with her poor industrial plans. Unemployment sky rocketed to 6m.
3658 2018-02-28 16:33:12 too right first things to boycott is the oil gas and electricity that goes south. That'll show the porridge-wogs.

3660 2018-02-28 16:33:08 There national security plan in that regard was solved by becoming one of the biggest oil and gas producers in the world.

In the last decade.

After we knew of the dangers.

But side effects of fucking up oil dependent enemies like VZ made it all too tempting.

3667 2018-02-28 16:32:32 we've ran out of oil!!!!!! im going to actually freeze
3668 2018-02-28 16:32:31 Don't forget to change the oil every 100 million miles unit its broken in.  Don't want to void the warrantee.
3669 2018-02-28 16:32:21 "Oil is the most hated rally in history". Bear thesis is based upon what might happen, bull thesis based upon what has, and is, happening. Bull thesis dismissed at first as impossible (OPEC+RUS). When happened, dismissed because of future shale prod. Oil bears are like zombies.
3670 2018-02-28 16:32:10 Big Oil loves that article! Education, research, connection are the ways to make change, and VA needs funds for that. They pick their battles. We have to be smart and not be manipulated by Big Oil's attempts to divert our attention. Divided we fall. #isupportvanaqua
3671 2018-02-28 16:31:51 There were 2 oil shocks. One in 73/74 and one in 78/79. Tory dealt with half of the first. Labour had both. It was these that sruffed the economy and led to high unemployment, power cuts etc

Funnily unemployment is the same now as it was in 79 when Tories came to power

3674 2018-02-28 16:31:44 The (dems & media) will do anything to divide this country. If TRUMP was a dem they would bow at his feet. Guns, like big oil,or Walmart is just the next wedge issue. They promote violence & Hate.

3677 2018-02-28 16:31:36 It's not a genuine push for a pipeline. It's a talking game. If you examine Trudeau's WORDS versus his ACTIONS that would be obvious. All of his ACTIONS have impeded oil exports from day he was elected.

3683 2018-02-28 16:31:04 It's critical to distinguish between regulating individual "right to choose" and the "right of sellers to market snake oil with false, unsupported claims of medical benefit."
3684 2018-02-28 16:31:01 in typical oil fashion, at some point, it'll probably retrace some of the one-directional move. Which is why I always trail behind action. Pop over 62.00 will probably take me flat.

3692 2018-02-28 16:30:31 Haha I really gotta hear your opinion of what Elon is doing negatively. Disrupting the oil industry and making clean energy products? Yeah, he’s a fucking piece of shit, I agree.

Just because someone speaks in a calm and concise manner doesn't mean what they're saying shouldn't be paid attention to. The man is a snake oil selling wolf in sheep's clothing.

3718 2018-02-28 16:27:24 @ERTACobblerLine We must not put all eggs in one basket, it is too reliant on roads, oil, car-legs and lorries for it's transport operations.

3724 2018-02-28 16:26:56 Well, I think gas shouldn't cost so much, but the Big Oil people exercising their "freedom" don't agree with me.  The sad thing is the state used to fund more, then they sold us on the lottery, then they implemented Robin Hood, then testing.
3725 2018-02-28 16:26:48 Alright, thank you! I’ll be trying that then (is it possible to use regular olive oil, or does it have to be a specific one?)
3726 2018-02-28 16:26:44 Let oil price fall, we no go hear pim  from you. You have not done anything to improve the economy, rising oil price is responsible for all you mentioned

3866 2018-02-28 16:12:11 If we get

- more harvests rotting in fields due to lack of pickers  
- more queues in hospitals
- a spike in oil prices that has a knock on impact on jet fuel, making air freight imports more expensive

Etc etc 

Then we may see everything implode.

3867 2018-02-28 16:11:56 A good part of their stock is not actual parts: motor oil, windshield wipers and fluid, tools - all kinds of stuff.  I suspect they make very little money on actual parts because of the labor cost to get the right one, storage, low margins.

4249 2018-02-28 15:35:54 1) All the major cities in the US are in those blue counties, as are the majority of people.
2) The Electoral College was created because our forefathers were afraid that a snake oil salesman could sway the masses. The E.C. failed due to corruption & gerrymandering so not needed.
4250 2018-02-28 15:35:51 Numbers of spill, even if true, doesn't matter but the volume. Fraking is one if the best controlled way of oil extraction. Frak is mostly in US, the pipeline being discussed here is moving from oilsands.

4476 2018-02-28 15:17:29 Oh look, a would-be dictator who would like to silence all dissenting voices.

A pro war, pro big oil, pro big pharma tyrant who would love nothing more than to keep the people from organizing to take the power to govern back from her cabal.
4477 2018-02-28 15:17:19 I showered, brushed me teeth, put keratin oil in me hair, borrowed a bit of expensive face cream bc my skin dry and I smell like a prize

4479 2018-02-28 15:16:55 This tweet is almost as good as the first caller today talking about Jets leaking oil, and allowing goals right after they score.
4480 2018-02-28 15:16:43 Oil and gas do have their special insentives here as well, and those are probably more along the lines of what you have problems with.

4487 2018-02-28 15:15:32 In Alberta they have recently rewritten the public education curriculum. There's been reports of kids coming home to their parents who work in the oil and gas industry and the kids would ask Mom and Dad why they are killing the planet.

4495 2018-02-28 15:14:49 Yeah I just really like the idea of using the stick to apply to paws. Makes it easier for everyone involved. Probably not great with peppermint oil in it though. Thanks for listening!

4512 2018-02-28 15:13:17 Is  Alta/Sask trend because Alberta relies more heavily on oil sands investment and industry is focusing more on tight oil plays?

4517 2018-02-28 15:13:02 Mr Segalink, this not true, I guess you should no that with or without Buhari in 2015 the economy was set for the direction of double digit inflation, due to d miserable fall in oil prices. The plague was set to happen in default, Iweala have settled this in her last interview.

ちょっと考えてみる
4519 2018-02-28 15:12:38 @ruralleafowner did you pay for a maintenance program ? For my Altima I have but it only covers oil and tires. I have to pay for any extra. After 20k Mi it will be my first out of pocket US$200 for some filters and CVT fluid change. How much did you spend with the Leaf ?
4520 2018-02-28 15:12:37 ????? ivr never experienced coconut oil that doesn't smell good

4526 2018-02-28 15:12:02 Are you really so lacking in intelligence that you don't understand it isn't up to the Tories.  The Scottish people chose to remain part of the union. The tax from oil paid for public services we wouldn't have had otherwise.
4527 2018-02-28 15:11:55 Growing up is knowing and loving how different ur car drives after a fresh oil change 
4528 2018-02-28 15:11:45 Spent nearly a year in Brunei, visiting Malaysia. Haven't used palm oil since. :(
4529 2018-02-28 15:11:45 Adam, the Oil was only “running out” due to the independence referendum, look now at what’s going on in the North Sea. BP plan to double production for just ONE SITE to 200,000 barrels a DAY at $70 a barrel. We also sell Whisky and more right around the globe.
We’ll be fine ;)
4530 2018-02-28 15:11:41 You are the best snake oil salesman in the business @marcorubio.  If only you believed a word that came out of your own mouth.

4533 2018-02-28 15:11:24 On BBC Trust me Im a doctor: Interesting small experiment testing butter, olive oil and coconut. Thought they would debunk the idea that an oil so high in saturated fat did any good but the experiment confirmed that coconut oil increases HDL cholesterol and by a large amount.
4534 2018-02-28 15:11:13 De rate at which Madrid is going down, soon dem go discover oil ooh
4535 2018-02-28 15:11:00 Bought a fresh new bottle of argon oil and my skin is fucking snatched bitch. I slept with it on last night and woke up feeling plumped and supple
4536 2018-02-28 15:10:55 I found that mineral oil had a super high eiq similar to chlorothalonil. One is considered organic but apparently had no benefit as far as eiq was concerned.
4537 2018-02-28 15:10:55 Question -

You see a woman standing in front of her car, hood is up, she is pouring something in, could be oil, could be washer fluid. You go over to see if she needs help. Sexist?

4555 2018-02-28 15:08:54 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
4556 2018-02-28 15:08:38 Went to get my oil changed and now have to get a new tire. Always something with this damn car #takinallmymoney
4557 2018-02-28 15:08:21 oil prices are up, Russia gets to sell new planes etc, and it'll leak to us plebs 
4558 2018-02-28 15:08:19 Simple, cool. Nothing else added, like vinegar, a sauce, or coconut oil?

4565 2018-02-28 15:07:48 No you moron. People dying of hunger and no medicines. If they wanted to have the oil they have the military power to do it in a month.

4569 2018-02-28 15:07:32 Took my car in to get inspected and a quick oil change, to find out my car has leaked all the oil out and has 2 months to live. Cool.

4576 2018-02-28 15:06:26 Why are you fixated with Norway?  It's a country in which you pay to see a doctor. The only thing it has in common with Scotland is population size and an oil industry.
4577 2018-02-28 15:06:24 I have an electric fire in the living room and an oil heater in the hall. Real fires and gas fire concern me.

4586 2018-02-28 15:05:28 They sell it as oil to put in food or under tongue. I couldn't smoke either, I've had lung cancer surgery.
4587 2018-02-28 15:05:20 Never was said by a real liberal. Sorry, but liberals like myself have done more for women than trump and your precious GOP have ever done.
4588 2018-02-28 15:05:15 Cheers, probably about half an hour to give a coat but spent about 1.5hrs on it just dusting over it and touching up so  couple of bits of tanning bleed that I’ll touch up with some oil based but other than that

4590 2018-02-28 15:04:59 Try using 100% maracuja oil! Tarte sells it but you can get an essential oil brand and it works just the same!
4591 2018-02-28 15:04:58 @Varneyco I keep watching the stocks on crude going up and down over the past month and if the speculators keep driving the price up,the market will crash! Does anyone know what inflation is? Transportation costs are driving prices up. It’s time Wall Street leaves crude oil alone
4592 2018-02-28 15:04:54 My new thing i ask if they can change my oil or car maintenance. Always about their benefits want a woman to be independent work full time maintain her self and cook when she gets home yea those years are gone.
4593 2018-02-28 15:04:47 何が気になってるのかわかんないけど普通に使えてるよ
4594 2018-02-28 15:04:47 They kept asking questions and I was like look all I know is I need my oil changed, one tire has low air or pressure or whatever, and something is rattling when I drive. Dassit.
4595 2018-02-28 15:04:40 Nothing smells worse than burnt frying oil in the morning fuck wrong wit ppl
4596 2018-02-28 15:04:34 Theyre the ones who had oil and money and good services and bikes and suits and state of the art tech and yet they still fucked it up.
4597 2018-02-28 15:04:30 @jimcramer Please have a look at Sand sector and its disconnect from domestic oil production. 

Sand/proppant up 2x in 18 mos, supply shortages, revs up 400%, efficiencies attained, but stocks languish 40-50% below FMV.

4617 2018-02-28 15:02:23 If our gvt ran anything at a profit, we too could have a sovereign wealth fund
If we had Norway's oil, we too could have a Statoil
If we had one of the richest and freest economies with $1tr to spare, we too could throw money at NHI
Since we have none of that, we can't have NHI

For my dollar, I would be very happy to pay for him to continue to dance the Bhangra, wear silly costumes, and visit faraway lands.

We are best served when he stays away from government. From our oil sector. And from NAFTA negotiations.
4625 2018-02-28 15:01:40 Hey @RealAlexJones, here is a free speech civics lesson. YouTube shutting you down isn't violating your free speech, they are not the government.  It is just a platform recognizing you as a shit snake oil salesman, and showing you the door. #Youarethedarkside
4626 2018-02-28 15:01:17 Is there any other subject the media lies so much about, so often, and gets away with it?

4644 2018-02-28 14:59:23 It is perception of leadership. Due respect, very father of our prime minister
could look right in the face of a strong Prez. Nixon and challenge him"I can close my oil on U.S." If that provoked the infamous 'a hole' response on him somewhere in his tapes.

4649 2018-02-28 14:58:47 I really should change the oil in my truck but I definitely don’t feel like doing it 
4650 2018-02-28 14:58:46 I’m weary of any on my face. Ended up with serious white heads from trying coconut oil on my face. But I do like skinny and co. That’s a good company. I like their body melts and deodorant. 
4651 2018-02-28 14:58:40 On the contrary, IndianaPutz,  the majority of this country is relishing with the upcoming Nov vote... and the ousting of the evil empire, and of course the soon to be impeached Orange Snake Oil Salesman.  Thank you for showing the true colors of this administration.

4660 2018-02-28 14:57:34 I actually enjoyed what I played of the beta, wasnt outstanding but it had a certain charm and gave you fun ways to play around like making the enemies slip on oil traps then continuously slam into spikes you had placed.

4680 2018-02-28 14:55:19 What would 'selling oil' bring in? You do know that the only income from oil that the state gets is from taxes? They were slashed at Swinney's request to protect the industry in the NE as prices plummeted. It isn't a winner now.

4683 2018-02-28 14:54:51 The difference is that the Petro is backed by the value of oil in Bolivares, which is a hyperinflated currency. It's basically a form of buying Bolivares without you knowing initially.

They are in big oil's pockets and they have no intention of meeting Paris commitments
4690 2018-02-28 14:53:42 Buy Greece! It is time for Brits to support our royal Kin. HRH Prince Philip is Greek Royalty and so let us buy not olives and olive oil from those who mean us harm, but instead support our Kin in Greece and help their people recover from the tyranny they suffer beneath.

4693 2018-02-28 14:53:31 It appears to me that CDC puts out the scares,  then big Pharma rakes in the bucks selling these "Cures" that usually create more problems that then they have a "cure" for...on and on...great racket, look at Tamiflu. In the old days they would have been called Snake oil salesman.

4710 2018-02-28 14:51:44 When we had this boiler put in, we gained an entire room because we also got rid of the oil tanks. Big win. Lucky for us we did that in August, though. 
4711 2018-02-28 14:51:32 Who said that?  It's all culture.
4712 2018-02-28 14:51:20 With the Oil out of the playoffs this was a perfect game for McLellan to step up for his players and lose it on Referee, Graham Skilliter.  He shouldn't have been happy until he was tossed.  I don't see him being connected to his boys.
4713 2018-02-28 14:51:13 Who's money went into the exploration of NORTH SEA OIL, to say nothing of the equipment for that exploration? the SNP have spent their inheritence and are now crying because cow has run dry?

4715 2018-02-28 14:51:00 Despite the sub zero temperature and attempts at snow, I switched on the studio heating yesterday, and managed to do a bit more to the NY oil. I spent time working detail into the background skyscraper and was quite pleased with how it progressed.

4735 2018-02-28 14:48:46 I’m not sure scientists can create individualistic rituals and empowerment. Maybe if Cambridge Analytica shared their 1000s of data points though .  But when researchers should take on snake oil and when to say maybe it makes their skin softer and let it be.

4746 2018-02-28 14:47:00 The #West is in the ongoing business of shoring up its assets & "vital interests" w/wide. #NATO has required a 'Russian Threat' to survive & thrive in a post Cold War world. Constant wars in the Middle East are required to weaken those opposed to #Israel & who may deny West oil.
4747 2018-02-28 14:46:53 my baby took my car to get a oil change yesterday... I needed that
4748 2018-02-28 14:46:42 Oh dear I’d say warm Olive Oil but can’t think that is any good in your case. Sorry...

4750 2018-02-28 14:46:25 You mean "fight against Big Oil that actually helps our economy while bowing down to OPEC and helping the Gulf State's with theirs"?
4751 2018-02-28 14:46:22 I’ve been wondering why I’m getting so shiny after only a few hours in drag when haven’t been before, I check out the setting spray I’ve been getting by with…; it has fucking Coconut Oil in it!! @HardCandyLife, coconut oil doesn’t make you glow, it makes you oily. #BigDifference
4752 2018-02-28 14:46:18 Caleb got me a gift card to Amazon and I was able to get the You Are A Badass book that I am super excited to read, a yoga bolster, a yoga mat bag and then some sunflower oil to make my own herbal abhyanga massage oil. I’m so excited! 
4753 2018-02-28 14:46:14 Obbessed with my new oil diffuser

4755 2018-02-28 14:45:43 usually just oil/vinegar based dressings. usually one with cilantro or whatever herbs, garlic, and shallots but sometimes like a honey mustard or something. nothing really complicated
4756 2018-02-28 14:45:39 Yes they are. (And oil paints). Balsa wood bases.
4757 2018-02-28 14:45:33 Medyo kumapal lang talaga kilay ko stap na ako sa castor oil!
4758 2018-02-28 14:45:31 Lol i just use a konjac sponge while washing and put some neem oil on it
4759 2018-02-28 14:45:22 Please @RockstarGames allow us to sell our personal special vehicles and Pegasus Vehicles such as The Dump, The Strech, Dune Globe Oil, The Anti-Aircraft Trailer, Ruiner 2000, Rocket Voltic,etc. Some of then I don’t want anymore and sell them to put the money to better use
4760 2018-02-28 14:45:20 That's not oil. :)
4761 2018-02-28 14:45:15 Buses are running. Hope the oil trucks are too.
4762 2018-02-28 14:45:06 I use my rose oil everyday. Love it
4763 2018-02-28 14:44:57 My house smells like German Shepard and peppermint oil
4764 2018-02-28 14:44:55 It's not really that hard... just need to put the chicken in one by one. 
-turn on small fire after put the frying pan on it and put some decent amount if cooking oil in it for deep fry-
4765 2018-02-28 14:44:45 I just want to know how my face produces more oil than a refinery but I have a few dry places. HOW.
4766 2018-02-28 14:44:43 아 씨팔 옛날 생각 너무 나서 하는 말이지만. 옛날 팬질 너무 해갖고 ㅜㅜ 요즘 팬질 솔직히 적응 힘들어.. 공출목이랑 뭐야.. 하여튼 여러가지들 ㅠㅠ 그때는 팬이 다 요즘 말하는 사생이라 그게 당연한걸로 안 새럼이 요즘 팬질 할라니까 되게 힘드름
4767 2018-02-28 14:44:36 Coconut milk even I love..But oil ?!!!
4768 2018-02-28 14:44:27 Maybe the next generation has just had it with politicians and elected officials who do NOTHING to protect them and are more beholden to NRA, oil and gas Koch brothers, other donors than they are in their own citizens.
4769 2018-02-28 14:44:20 Ireland is virtually entirely dependent upon UK for trade and not EU from energy, importing 90 per cent of its oil and more than 90 per cent of its gas,and all its exports is with UK and no EU. When the bubble burst, Ireland' was on her knees who help? No EU but UK that help them

And it goes on...
4773 2018-02-28 14:43:45 Why does my apartment smell like stinky flowers? Hey @MisterDelcid what did you put in the oil diffuser? 
4774 2018-02-28 14:43:24 73. Saved thousands of Muslims & Christians from being murdered by ISIS
74.  Put an end to ISIS killing non converters to butcher for body organs to sell on black market to fund their terrorism
75. Took back ISIS controlled oil wells used to fund terrorism & have back to Iraq

4776 2018-02-28 14:43:22 The fundamental destabilizing force in the Middle East is the ongoing need of the western powers to shore up the power of #Israel while ensuring continuing access to the vital oil it needs. All else said is PR & propaganda, demonizing all who would expose or hinder their plans.

4779 2018-02-28 14:42:23 Dale on uptick in renewables: Moving toward a diversified fuel mix. Natural gas, coal and oil are expected to make up just a quarter of the energy market each.
4780 2018-02-28 14:42:21 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
4781 2018-02-28 14:42:13 I was just singing in front of my grandpa and he goes “oh god no, we need some oil for that squeeky wheel” ouch
4782 2018-02-28 14:42:06 Freeman mask manuka honey and tea tree oil is so 
4783 2018-02-28 14:42:01 I believe John Major exported more of parliaments powers to the unelected Brussels elite under the Maastricht Treaty which was "just a matter of tying up a few legal loose ends." Snake Oil comes to mind.

4816 2018-02-28 14:37:59 She studied his large hands as she passed, marked by streaks of black oil embedded into his skin after years of "grease monkey" work, as he called it. No matter how fiercely or often he washed them, that oil had tattooed his fingers and hands with permanence. #1linewed

4823 2018-02-28 14:36:48 which it hardly ever is, judging by the amount of it now found inside fish. Also it's made from oil, which we will one day run out of
4824 2018-02-28 14:36:42 Make an aloe vera gel + castor oil mixture and use it every night before you sleeeeep! 
4825 2018-02-28 14:36:41 Sir, not in IL, TN, but we had a major win for CBD oil yday. State testing could not say CBD was made from MJ or Hemp so state reversed convictions of shop owners w CBD. CBD is like a insulator to injured nerves from my days as CH47 Flight Engineer in US Army. *Rmv MJ from Sch1*

4828 2018-02-28 14:36:19 WOW. Yeah. They're just openly calling for regime change now. That is wild. I knew the oil and steel industries were striking, not just the mining industries, good to have videos of that happening. Fantastic.

4849 2018-02-28 14:34:15 I think the army should be out in this weather to help out the elderly in effected areas where roads arent gritted & covered in snow to see if they need  food coal & oil for their heating #BeastFromTheEast #snow #snowday2018 #snowday
4850 2018-02-28 14:33:57 It depends on the debt structure. Chinese will want oil rights. Not sure about Russia.
4851 2018-02-28 14:33:56 What connects to that rationale is the fact govt acts like they're concerned about opioid problem , yet cannibus oil cures cancer and doctors still advocate for radiation therapy.

4861 2018-02-28 14:32:30 Mr. President now that we’re #1 in energy, shouldn’t we build a new US owned refinery to process US oil & liquify natural gas & sell our coal & oil to pay off our national debt? @ENERGY @SecretaryPerry @WhiteHouse @VP @SenateMajLdr @RandPaul @SpeakerRyan @Varneyco @FoxBusiness
4862 2018-02-28 14:32:25 a cool thing, to me, is that saint paul talks a big game about being progressive but its "innovation cabinet" is mostly white men, many of whom are involved in the finance, defense, and oil industries

4866 2018-02-28 14:31:37 It mostly began with the drop of oil prices. The excessive money 'printing' was the result of hyperinflation, and not the cause (as is almost always the case with hyperinflation)
4867 2018-02-28 14:31:35 Market watch: Oil and cement garner attention as KSE-100 gains 0.57%

4870 2018-02-28 14:31:06 Whether Genie Oil or who gets access to European Natural Gas market  via Syria is actually none of our business. Deep state interests are not American interests. As a matter of fact, I would argue they are antithetical to each other.

4873 2018-02-28 14:31:00 If it ever happened? But that's has nothing to do with what's going on now + it's not like Russia is trying to make nukes like North Korea Russia is 2nd most powerful country who's hostile and hates America and DJT has a lot invested there and wants him some oil $ from Russia

4882 2018-02-28 14:30:33 Indeed! Basically we use the same method and data (CO2 by main fuel type from IEA, fuel trend from BP and fuel trend% from NBSC, respectively). Actually, when I apply it more precisely,including *net* fossil oil from BP plus IEA "other fuel", I get 1.7% for China's 2017 CO2 trend

4884 2018-02-28 14:30:23 True Larry, but there is far to much money in oil trains on CN.  CP to a similar level.  Harshly, the chickens are coming to roost from terrible government decisions now and in the past.  This government has no concept on how to fix the railways.

4896 2018-02-28 14:29:05 Is your skin oily because it’s overcompensating for how dehydrated it is or have you always been oily because it might be better to reach the right hydration vs fight the oil
4897 2018-02-28 14:28:55 Seen Oil Tankers turn quicker. Nasty streak too. Not a bad passer but I'm still waiting for that penalty at Wembley to land.

4932 2018-02-28 14:25:40 On the day of Holi, make sure you apply almond oil all over your body.  Especially, on the parts that are most exposed.

4941 2018-02-28 14:24:10 About the only time it's pleasant on a pacer is bundling along through the snowy countryside, the heating slightly too high and the whiff of diesel and hot oil it's like a mobile nissen hut
4942 2018-02-28 14:24:06 I did a rice water rinse this morning but it smelled like butt. Next time I'll add some essential oil to tone down the stink 
4943 2018-02-28 14:23:55 What smells stronger: lavender essential oil, or hot bacon, egg and cheese

4952 2018-02-28 14:22:39 I used CO2 emissions from coal, gas and oil products for 2014 from IEA's CO2 database (released in 2016). Then for 2015 and 2016 I used BP (2017) fuel consumption trends. Lastly, I estimated the 2017 fuel consumption per type from the Stat Comm. (see our annual CO2/GHG report)
4953 2018-02-28 14:22:35 Yes there needs to be a total ban on Big Oil subsidies and exploration and a massive effort by every sector of society like with WW2 to convert the Earth to green energy within the next 10 years.
4954 2018-02-28 14:22:29 I strongly believe that you were part of the people that buried the country. You said PDP wasted $500B Oil money in 16 yrs. How much have you wasted in about 4 years? You've been complaining ever since and nothing to show for it. It's a shame!
4955 2018-02-28 14:22:22 Showers and baths add moisture to your skin, but they can also dry it out by removing the skin's natural oils. Hot water washes away oil faster than warm water. So use warm water when you cleanse your face and limit yourself to one short (five minutes) warm shower or bath a day.
4956 2018-02-28 14:22:19 @POTUS Dear sir. Respectfully I ask you to invade us. Please invade Venezuela and then, Brazil. So, America could take over of the oil reserves in Venezuela and here in Brazil also our fresh water supply and other valuable goods. Please sir. We counting on you. Thank you.
4957 2018-02-28 14:22:14 I ripped my eyelashes off from my extensions so every night I take a spooly and dip it in the oil and apply it like mascara. I do it to my brows as well. My eyelashes grew back in about 2 weeks and so lush. Gotta try it!

4983 2018-02-28 14:18:39 You (and the Petroleum Institute which you represent) ask that we look at the bigger picture.  So let's do that.  Solar and wind energy are cheap and getting cheaper.  We have more oil already than we can use and fossil fuels are heating the climate of the planet.  Big picture.

5154 2018-02-28 13:57:42 Could it be the vastly lower energy densities of current batteries /lb/volume vs oil and gas?  Just a thought.
5155 2018-02-28 13:57:36 Yesterday, I had the opportunity to meet with Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, about the threat offshore oil drilling poses to the Jersey Shore’s tourism and fishing industries.
5156 2018-02-28 13:57:34 guessing the 1973 oil embargo ?

5159 2018-02-28 13:57:00 If you're against fracking, what measures of domestic energy production are you willing to support?

Coal mining is outdated and no longer viable.

North Sea oil & gas can't provide enough for our future domestic energy needs, nor can solar & tidal power, so what do you support?

5162 2018-02-28 13:56:33 @GovLarryHogan. disappointed to hear MD residential homeowner reimbursement fund is now taking 3 years to get people their money back. Not a good way to encourage people to remove leaking heating oil tanks.
5163 2018-02-28 13:56:30 Mama-put would rather put excess oil in your food than give you extra stew..
5164 2018-02-28 13:56:27 Thank u Pst Chris Okotie.
PMB is not perfect,he has inconveniently taken for himself the risk of fighting against corrupt elements in our society who are powerful&with media to oil their propaganda against their arch enemy.

PMB need more of this encouragement.

5184 2018-02-28 13:53:38 You start out with a bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic...you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it, make sure it doesn't stick. You get it to a boil; you shove in all your sausage and your meatballs, a little bit o' wine, a little bit o' sugar...that's my trick.
5185 2018-02-28 13:53:17 That is exactly THE point
Outlook for oil and battery metals changes soooo much based on what figures you chose!
5186 2018-02-28 13:53:15 wellll make sure to cleanse well with whatever works for ur skin type everyday before u go to bed, after that use a cotton pad with rose water on it and wipe ur face with it, use vitman C acid serum and let ur face absorb it and then vitamin E oil to moisturiz, thank me later
5187 2018-02-28 13:53:13 That's pretty dark, Andrew.

Also I mean oil rides on top of the water so all we have to do is pull water from the bottom and filter out all the dead fish no big deal.
5188 2018-02-28 13:53:11 Any chance we can also get this for cars? Maybe making it drive on crude oil to give that one a second use?

5196 2018-02-28 13:52:05 But the Scottish economy went up by 1.9% when the oil price crashed to $27pb, and now it's back in the high 60's so how do you figure this loss of yours ?
5197 2018-02-28 13:52:04 Im more concerned about how she’s going to cook the evening meal with her hands caked in oil. It’s probably just a fad she’ll be back to hoovering before long

Did you know? The amount of recoverable oil and natural gas around the world has been rapidly expanding thanks to the advanced development of technology in the last couple of decades.

5209 2018-02-28 13:51:15 If PDP invested money they made on oil on refineries now oil price would have been down considerably.
Some pple got nothing to do with $ and £ yet they are making noise about it.

5213 2018-02-28 13:51:02 An oil subsidy is only acceptable if it is provided by the UCP.

5214 2018-02-28 13:50:55 Things aren’t inherently good or evil. We put these labels on. Oil is the reason you can go from NYC to Rome in 8 hours like magic. But it’s also why the EPA’s Scott Pruitt wants to poison the air and water.

5283 2018-02-28 13:42:45 Yes, oil is better than electricity. I did look into Propane or similar once - but the price was appalling. And now, replacing the boiler etc would cost much more than my author's salary would allow!

5306 2018-02-28 13:38:38 Thats only part of the story, Russia gets Syrian oil and Gas and rebuild the country from its revenue. Iran is not involved in any of it. Well you wanted Iran out of Syria.. Dont cry about it now.
5307 2018-02-28 13:38:23 3) If the mixer isn’t used on a weekly basis, run the mixer at least once a week to keep the grease and oil incorporated together. While we do not recommend ingesting any of the oil that may have gotten into the food, all of the products used in our mixers are non toxic.
5308 2018-02-28 13:38:11 Remember the time Jamaica discovered oil?

5310 2018-02-28 13:37:52 Fair examination- is it too much to ask after burning midnight oil for months n years? 
#sscscam
5311 2018-02-28 13:37:50 2) Unless the mixer has lost a fairly large amount of oil (¼ cup or more) this is most likely not a concern. Turn the unit on to speed 10 and let the unit run for 2 minutes. After 2 minutes, turn off the mixer and wipe any excess oil from around the planetary action.

While the world wasn't paying attention, China played "Monetary Moneyball": "U take these UST's, we'll take a controlling share of ur oil (etc) production for the next X yrs."  If China ctrls this & others' oil in this way, are we still sure CNY oil contract will flop?

5318 2018-02-28 13:37:10 1) Hi, we apologize for the inconvenience and frustrations with the oil leaking. It is normal over time, if not used on a regular basis that some oil can settle and separate causing it to leak out.

5514 2018-02-28 13:10:09 The very basis of any religious belief (faith) leads society down a road to falling for a whole host of snake oil salesmen/bad political ideology by simply not requiring evidence of claims; you don't need extremists for that.

5521 2018-02-28 13:09:23 (1/n) See, when we import items like oil, chana, daal etc we also make the farmers of those countries dependent on us. They too start growing for India. Now if we suddenly reduce the import it will bankrupt those farmers.

5539 2018-02-28 13:06:56 Definitely fried man, though I prefer bacon grease.
If I don't have it or want a lighter taste I go olive oil with a touch of butter to add a bit of flavor.

Here's some #krisonomics.

The only way to hold up prices of anything, stocks, bonds, tomatoes, houses, cars, crude oil, aluminum etc, is to:

CREATE SCARCITY.

Get the point, folks?

Scarcity = Higher price

Abundance = Lower price

Still happy about high prices?

5615 2018-02-28 12:56:57 Germany and Russia are not responsible for the economic dependence of PL and UA on russian transit fees. It's economics.

5618 2018-02-28 12:56:50 Just like canola oil (made from Canadian Rape Seed) was used as light-weight machine oil-but was displaced by synthetics--So they HAD to come-up better than "Rape Seed" oil so ppl would use to cook!

5634 2018-02-28 12:54:03 Understand the interface, but that's not what happened under Thatcher (unemployment increased, revenue was artificially boosted by North Sea oil). As for corporation tax, current levels are below all orthodox Laffer curve optimums, so no, cuts don't boost revenue at this level.

5703 2018-02-28 12:40:31 So I'm starting to accept the whole aquafaba being actual magic thing. But now I'm hearing people are using it as a replacement for oil when frying. What is this sorcery!? Still reckon this may be a step too far. Any of y'all out there tried this? #wfpd #aquafaba
5704 2018-02-28 12:40:24 The Oil Industry Drills into the Blockchain The historic and paper-intensive ways of the oil industry are due for an upgrade, especially amid heightened demand for the commodity. Some of the biggest names in oil transport are leading the charge for the integration of blockchain.

5757 2018-02-28 12:34:00 No. It was the two major oil shocks when the oil producing countries like Saudi Arabia witheld production. Cars queued at petrol stations for miles amd electricity cuts happened. Not because of the unions but because of the OPEC statea
5758 2018-02-28 12:33:49 I'm at a meeting where NPA @nigerianports is outlining new guidelines for Stevedoring operations. From what I can see, there'll be additional costs for downstream oil companies. This will one day be transfered to your pump price.

Editing didn’t happen, had to take my car in, they found an oil leak which is $1300 to fix. Then got hubby’s medical bills from a 2-hour emergency room visit when he had heart palpitations: $1700
I was waaaay to distracted by both those things to edit 
5836 2018-02-28 12:24:43 They told us assad was buying oil from isis then report said EU lifted sanctions to allow oil exports to EU after ISIS took over oil fields 
5837 2018-02-28 12:24:40 He cannot even he wanted to. He doesn’t have the means to undertake such a huge operation.Maldives hasn’t oil production facilities or refineries. It doesn’t have many tankers or oil storage facilities anywhere.These r all unfounded rumours without any substance
5838 2018-02-28 12:24:25 That's a little inaccurate. Academics later did defs. I agree with you that IOTA  is snake oil and, separately things should have definitions, but I can think of only a handful of systems that do and nearly none that did at launch.

3. Wash it off with a mild soap and warm water.
4. Do this once daily until the skin tone around your elbows lightens.
5848 2018-02-28 12:21:54 You are either naive or just bltantly lying. It is well established fact that STO Singapore bought fuel and then sold to Myanmar in international waters and back then too they chartered tankers. We don't have to be oil producing to sell oil illegally.

5851 2018-02-28 12:21:31 I don’t believe in fabricated documents. STO doesn’t have the capital, capacity n means to undertake an operation of the magnitude you are taking about.Maldives is a small economy with limited resources n it isn’t an oil producing nation.

6040 2018-02-28 11:52:21 I’m not sure what your point is other than that the oil industry wants to maximise sales.

We have the technology to generate all electric through renewable sources and phase out the combustion engine but it isn’t happening because it isn’t as profitable as oil.

Global warming is almost certainly caused by the Co2, which mainly comes oil. Oil is profitable, it is THE global commodity. The money maker. That’s why there is a reluctance to move away from it.

Unless the price of water rises significantly up north, drilling is tough to justify. Better to just import food from places with water

6388 2018-02-28 10:48:50 Try coconut oil and/or egg mask. Like, use actual eggs. Olive oil helps too. But coconut is much better. Eating cucumber helps clearing acne. Also papaya.

6395 2018-02-28 10:47:20 Yes but the oil is of lesser quality and needs refinement. This attempt to lower prices by exaggerating the efficacy of fracking methods amounts to another injection of credit into this already bloated economy.

6494 2018-02-28 10:28:41 I sympathise, the same thing happened to me with oil once, but with such an open-plan house you *need* to have a small sitting room that can be heated with an electric heater as well. Most of that stove's heat is dissipating into the vastness of the space.

6517 2018-02-28 10:22:36 As for OPEC. Last year? OPEC has been setting the price of oil for longer than either of us has been alive. Well, trying to. Ever since the US became a net exporter they've lost their strangle hold and it is far more market reactive then OPEC controlled.

6523 2018-02-28 10:21:17 《オリーブ油豆知識》

オリーブ油は、オリーブの果実から得られる植物油である。
6524 2018-02-28 10:20:41 Just know if you see me I don’t have greasy hair I have coconut oil on my hair, it needs some tlc so I’m leaving it on 24hours. 
6525 2018-02-28 10:19:46 Not so simple - the cheapest way to get feedstock for bioplastics is by ripping up rainforests and planting fast growing stuff. Replacing dependence on oil with dependence on something else from somewhere isn’t a great option no matter how attractive it may initially seem.
6526 2018-02-28 10:19:45 Macro tailwinds like oil, inflation, #CAD etc are turning negative at the margin, but not alarmingly so. However, rationalization of logistics following #GST, new resolutions for #Banks, policies like #HousingForAll, electricity for all & #MUDRA point to higher economic growth.

6529 2018-02-28 10:19:39 What about that? So oil earnings have stopped since then? Use the one Nigeria is making better and stop the complain.
6530 2018-02-28 10:19:28 So??? You didn't say that when there is oil spillages on land or sea with massive environmental consequences, yet big oil lobbies and buys politicians everyday...

6729 2018-02-28 09:39:12 Agreed.. But look at most of the conflicts going on and you will find that the US have either armed/encouraged/destabilised one side against the other. Sometimes the rebels, sometimes the government. Its not always Oil.. Its always US interests.
6730 2018-02-28 09:38:59 '...reported by the Turkish Anadolu agency to be part of a broader bombing campaign in Deir Ezzor aimed at halting the advance of forces loyal to the Assad government on strategically important gas and oil fields'

I get out of bed and out of the shower because I don’t have N400m hidden somewhere. And my parents don’t have oil block either.

7335 2018-02-28 07:35:04 Simply apply a diluted solution of this oil on wounds, or use it after blending with a skin cream and your wounds will heal faster and will also be protected from infections. Frankincense oil is equally beneficial in healing internal wound, cuts, and ulcers.

7478 2018-02-28 07:05:20 Yeah like he did when he belied Russia by lowering import cost in oil and coal and placing a 40% tariff ok solar panels because he really care about all sides...
7479 2018-02-28 07:05:03 Don’t want to go get my oil changed tomorrow):
7480 2018-02-28 07:04:55 Guys scrapping in practice during what was a horrendous stretch for the Sabres, isn't uncommon. But when Kane is involved, it becomes a story.
7481 2018-02-28 07:04:43 Make stock
Use some of the stock to make a broth (reduce a bit, and add sesame oil, soy sauce and whatever else you like)
Steam a little veg

Add chilli oil to bowl
Add veg + noodles
Add broth
Add protein (beef, chicken, pork, eggs - whatever you want)
Garnish with spring onions
7482 2018-02-28 07:04:21     see this old cargo, used machine. You are the one that needs the oil more.
7483 2018-02-28 07:04:13 Hope the oil doesn’t ruin your bike shorts

7486 2018-02-28 07:02:44 we also overthrew Libya because they wanted to go off the oil standard dollar and go onto the golden silver dollar that is why we killed Qaddafi remember HRC said we came we saw we killed all this for the petrodollar
7487 2018-02-28 07:02:36 Have said repeatedly I'd love to see in Edmonton. If the UFA market is soft for him, Oilers would be wise to offer Kane a 1 yr deal to play w/ 97 & help recoup his value around the league.

7496 2018-02-28 07:01:32 In 22 hours I will have successfully completed my 28 day fast & I will get to eat food for the first time in a MONTH. I'll be having a tomato & roasted red bell-pepper bisque simmered in olive oil infused with garlic & basil, with a 3 cheese blend & a dollop of sour cream on top.
7497 2018-02-28 07:01:26 This morning, a coworker said I looked like I had a glow. Another girl agreed. So, I think they’re sweet! or it was a nice way of saying I looked greasy - I was too apathetic to wear makeup and had just smeared coconut oil and moisturizer on my face before leaving the house
7498 2018-02-28 07:01:15 #HoliBeautySecret  
Before holi-use of coconut oil then sun screen ,
On hair - apply oil -braided hair or make bun 
Post holi - use organic products on skin n hair - use aloe vera gel both on skin n hair...
7499 2018-02-28 07:00:02 For shiny hair, mix one egg with a olive oil and apply to your hair. Leave it on for 20-30 minutes then shower.
7500 2018-02-28 06:59:54 Oh yeah man my beard oil spending is through the roof
7501 2018-02-28 06:59:51 i really don't omg at first i thought it was the new oil so i skipped it last night but now i think it's the moisturiser which is weird cause hello it's a moisturiser
7502 2018-02-28 06:59:47 Omg that happened to me...throw a crap ton of coconut oil on it... and sleep in it. Find some oleplex somewhere... and sleep in that.  Don't dye it. Grab a toner (T14 and T18 wella are nice) and put on with 10 developer. It won't harm your hair.
7503 2018-02-28 06:59:41 Many are and obviously his earlier stunts have scared many a GM off. Too bad but someone is going to get a damn good player & it may just be the Sharks.
7504 2018-02-28 06:59:34 Genus Fulmarus 
Fulmarus derived from Old Norse word fúll meaning foul, and már meaning gull; reference to the smell of their stomach oil.
7505 2018-02-28 06:59:11 Tacos and just the oil from the corn ones just disgust tf out of me
7506 2018-02-28 06:59:07 When boiling water and it starts foaming over, pour in some olive oil. Just a bit. It'll make the overflowing go away.

7509 2018-02-28 06:58:27 Another is brominated vegetable oil, which is oil treated with a fire retardant. So I guess it'll come in clutch in case of a fire?

7513 2018-02-28 06:57:42 Oil money > tourism money
7514 2018-02-28 06:57:28 Finally, there's also the US$ part. Russia and China now deal oil & gas in Yuan and Rubles. Russia's economy is entirely self-contained, and that's all transacted in Rubles. Cheap Rubles means that Russian exports earn more relative profit than dollar-based economies.

7516 2018-02-28 06:57:00 Oh! That reminds me, one of my fave things i used to do is mix hemp oil w/ a dot of tea tree oil and rub my face for like 5-10 minutes, then wipe it off w/ a warm wet wash cloth. Baby skin. I need smore of these things :u

7518 2018-02-28 06:56:31 So please don’t dismiss this serious concern with some childish chicken little meme. We are talking about expanding climate change inducing oil production, or not. We are talking about increasing the risk to our economically critical coastlines, or not. So please, be serious.

7524 2018-02-28 06:56:01 fair enough but isn't every game the oil win worse for them from here on out?????
7525 2018-02-28 06:55:58 Strengthened by non oil sector which was strengthened by oil sector figures. Look at the figures. #FreshlyPressed981

7528 2018-02-28 06:55:37 I spilled olive oil on my T-shirt while accidentally making tabbouleh with coriander instead of parsley (ba2dounes) so my friend gave me a T-shirt of someone she hooked up with and I spilled wine on that and have to give it to him myself now

What a time to be alive 2.0
7529 2018-02-28 06:55:28 Sounds so familiar-in a creepy way.  He must have borrowed the Seuss tactic from a certain Snake Oil Salesman on the Hill.  Pure genius.
7530 2018-02-28 06:54:53 Pffffff. Check out the grown up without beard oil. I bet he owns a house AND eats avocados too.  ;)
7531 2018-02-28 06:54:35 One thing I'm still bullish on...I would have rathered the 4th rd pick but Aberg will have to do.
7532 2018-02-28 06:54:23 Yeah if @KM_Canada is stopped jobs and tax revnus will move from Burnaby  to Blaine and prices paid by #MetroVan #bcpoli drivers will soar soar  soar espy if US$ climbs as expected. Even worse: since #TMPL is full  Blaine will import more oil via more tankers! Be careful what you

7543 2018-02-28 06:52:48 It has nothing to do with tonight's game. My point is the perception of the player is based on something that just isn't true. Was it at one time? 100% but don't think that has been the case for a bit now.

7546 2018-02-28 06:52:06 No, the energy inquiry found that SA's major problem was insufficient baseload supply. ie too many windmills, not enough coal/oil generation.
You can waffle dishonestly all you want, but that won't reduce SA's ruinous prices and unreliability.
7547 2018-02-28 06:51:51 #1 American and Canadian oil has been sailing up and down our coast and in and out of Vancouver for decades and I would say post-Valdez there certainly has been worry of the risks. Otherwise why the continued northern tanker ban? So your red herring is just that.

7567 2018-02-28 06:47:37 There was zero chance he signs unless the $ was reasonable & Buffalo started to turn the corner. Neither were going to happen w/ that Sabres roster.
7568 2018-02-28 06:47:33 The classification is ridiculous & I hope it gets swiftly overturned. But does the film really explore "toxic" masculinity? (Also, the thrust/theme of the film is the inherent, irreconcilable conflict between Xhosa culture & homosexuality -- like oil & water, they're NOMA.)

7573 2018-02-28 06:46:35 I thought they got Lucic for this sort of game. If I'm the Oilers I don't overreact by this because knowing them they'll trade 30 cents on the dollar for toughness  or overpay in term/$ for it.Its funny how everyone talked about the Oil not being pushed around in Cali last yr.
7574 2018-02-28 06:46:23 Not forgetting it’s the quality that counts too - a quality free range butter & extra virgin olive oil. And an understanding of how they synergistically work with food. Our ancestors knew this instinctively.

I’ve been diving deep on your content, but outside of vague but true NWO insight, my insight has been that there is a US/Saudi plan for an oil pipeline to Europe that directly challenges Russia’s majority on the region.

7616 2018-02-28 06:40:13 Disagree, the hear from earths core is reduced as reservoirs of oil, water, seas absorb a few degrees. Removing billions of gallons of oil allows more heat to get to the surface.
7617 2018-02-28 06:40:07 Why are Israel, Turkey, and the USA bombing Syria? Is this just because oil or because Israel and Syria do not like each other?

7619 2018-02-28 06:40:01 It is just to inform all that SNGPL transmission department put the odourant oil for detection of gas leakage

So no need to worry and if you find any leakage so inform SUI gas emergency department

7766 2018-02-28 06:15:05 Here's something totally weird that happened today that I am unable to fully explain. 

A friend and I met for lunch earlier this month. In the course of our chat, she mentioned a particular brand of hair oil. I made a mental note of it. *Please note: 'Mental' note.

7772 2018-02-28 06:14:45 It's interesting that they're testing it against a placebo of olive oil, which contains omega 3 & 6 fatty acids that are one of the claimed benefits of fish oil. It wouldn't surprise me if this study ended out having a null (or negative) result when compared to olive oil.

7782 2018-02-28 06:13:15 it can be. 
it’s definitely worth trying, for many people a coconut oil hair mask gives them lasting moisture & softness. 
on the flip side it can weigh your hair down and/or cause your hair to be too oily.

7910 2018-02-28 05:53:22 PSA to ladies who wear falsies a lot: when removing them, use almond oil. not only does it take them off w/o pulling your lashes, but the almond extract also makes your lashes grow. i use it, it works.

7919 2018-02-28 05:51:30 I always advise, India & Middle east should join hands. India is a big importer of oil n gas & ME is a big importer of food products/medicines etc. local currency trading /through local banks can be done and save on $.  @PMOIndia @narendramodi @arunjaitley
7920 2018-02-28 05:51:22 Right now Sweden gets some of its electricity from burning oil due to lack of power in South Sweden. Danish coal also at full blast for same reason. #barsebäck
7921 2018-02-28 05:51:19 Remember when 'big oil' at least tried to offer a PLAUSIBLE reason for gas prices going up? Now they don't even bother--prices seem to rise and fall on a whim. Wake up people, DEMAND accountability!

7940 2018-02-28 05:47:58 There’s a reason why the figure of speech is- a snake OIL salesmen. I don’t trust anyone trying to sell me oil.

if I need it, my car and French fries will tell me so.
7941 2018-02-28 05:47:41 Our business model stands firm in the case of environmental issues, "in hop oil we trust!"

7948 2018-02-28 05:46:27 Can you get to a chemist? Flying congested can be really painful (you probably know that). Load up on sudafeds or similar. And saturate a hanky in eucalyptus oil to inhale - until twitter doctors respond with something better. Regards ex frequent flyer nanna.

7956 2018-02-28 05:44:45 Today this lady stopped me admiring my baby hair. She asked me what I do to it so I told her I grease it with coconut oil then rub olive oil thru it twice a day. I'm not being mean but I was so confused being that we're 2 different ethnicities. Idk how that would help her.

7966 2018-02-28 05:43:03 I feel coconut oil clogged my the pores on my scalp, is this posible? Also tomorrow I am gonna exfoliate my head with baking soda so I can get rid of the product buildup.
7967 2018-02-28 05:42:49 That's awful! I feel bad for you guys!  Had something similar once in our old barn. Have to pump the cows that ate alot of grain with mineral oil or something. Your Vet will know.
7968 2018-02-28 05:42:40 hmmmm
do i drain the oil/fat/etc from the crockpot if i'm going to be turning this into a cream of chicken soup with real chicken & canned veggies
or do i just use that as supplement for the water
because idk
i feel like that would be ridiculously bad in oil
maybe i drain a bit?

7985 2018-02-28 05:40:32 The question for me is how much CO2 will be sequestered for every barrel of oil it pushes up. With subsidized EOR, the sequestration can exceed the extraction. You could even have carbon-negative oil if it uses direct air capture of the CO2.

7987 2018-02-28 05:40:24 Gaddafi was stuck just like how Maduro is stuck. Because of OPEC all oil & vast majority of commodities are sold in $ hence US sanctions cripples a nations. Also he didn’t invest in defence, in fact Libya didn’t really have a Army tbh. It was made up of tribal militia.
7988 2018-02-28 05:40:04 .The candidate @StefanRumpel who is running in the by-election to fill Brad Wall's seat isn't thrilled by this. But he wants to see govt sit down at the table to create a Sask-made solution that doesn't hurt oil & gas or agriculture. Sounds like a better plan than suing the feds.

8019 2018-02-28 05:34:37 So I have to be out of here by 7am. New tires, alignment, and oil change at my fav shop that also happens to be slow as dirt.
8020 2018-02-28 05:34:32 Can we all get over "imperialism" and move on. We should not support this government as they have done nothing for their ppl. I think they thought the oil money would last forever. I have a feeling that Colombia might use military force if things don't change. We'll see.
8021 2018-02-28 05:34:32 Coco has been my winter/nighttime scent for the past 15+ years. Mademoiselle is my everyday scent. Both parfumes can be heavy. I literally spray half a pump in the air and walk through the mist.

Why is it people have the MOST problem with the NRA. And what does it matter if ALL NRA members were men. That's sexist isn't it

8052 2018-02-28 05:29:06 When Oil signed Lucic, I thought $3M was for ability to score points and $3M for leadership and toughness. Sad Overpay on both accounts.

8056 2018-02-28 05:27:30 We have been importing oil successfully  on the east coast for decades. It's still beautiful!
8057 2018-02-28 05:27:15 I put castor oil on my eyelashes so I better fucking wake up looking like snuffleupagus
8058 2018-02-28 05:27:10 Mr President @realDonaldTrump the choice is clear: free-market RINS = WINS for US workers, motorists, and for clean air. Don’t let oil interests pollute the convo here. #rfsworks Corn is America’s crop and corn ethanol is America’s biofuel. #Classic18

8067 2018-02-28 05:25:08 @joliekerr A Portuguese seamstress who made 1940s glamorous ladies loungewear taught me the trick of sprinkling baby powder on oil spots or spills on clothes. The powder absorbs the oil and then just brush off. A neat trick when traveling.

8074 2018-02-28 05:24:38 Okay good. Put tree tea oil on it when you can shoild heal it right up and help keep the co edition of the nail growing pretty well. Mix it with jojoba oil as well you you should be golden. Haha sorry I know too much about nails
8075 2018-02-28 05:24:19 Not oil, coal, poverty? Any vicious use of religion does not mean religion is itself evil.

8077 2018-02-28 05:23:25 America’s energy leadership will be destroyed if Democrats win the house or get anywhere near Senate majority.  Once again, we will be under Chinese solar cell control on one side and the whimsy of oil cartel on the other hand.
8078 2018-02-28 05:23:17 I need a lash perm baddd. I’ve been using castor oil on them and the longer they get the straighter they become. It’s sad but I love my long lashes

8080 2018-02-28 05:23:13 The glass ceiling sits on top of marble pillars too saturated with oil to climb. My muscles have given out from trying to grip hard enough to inch my way up. 

The ceiling is much higher than those pillars anyway.

8087 2018-02-28 05:22:12 Your logic doesn't follow. I eat tons of vegetable oil but no vegetables. Checkmate.

        - get bored of her and leave. 

Her head laying down on his lap her long black locks draped over his legs like a blanket. Silky and shining like a raven's feather. 

      Her secret ;
                  Olive oil. 

The rest of her tails reveal themselves -


8100 2018-02-28 05:20:19 おめうめ
8101 2018-02-28 05:20:18 If you don’t believe that transitioning to renewable energy is a national security issue, then consider this… in 2012, 7% of the world's known oil reserves were in countries that allowed private international companies free rein. 65% were in the hands of state-owned companies.
8102 2018-02-28 05:20:17 やぞ
8103 2018-02-28 05:20:09 グラン君もジータちゃんも未成年や
8104 2018-02-28 05:20:02 Oh lucky you, hot oil generally leads to third degree burns. Get well soon. Looking forward to #RubhuSocial next week
8105 2018-02-28 05:19:53 Yes, that's all these guys care about. If being anti RU was more $$$ in their pockets, that's what they'd be. Still think the deal was lifting sanctions for a share of RU oil. Real billions, at last!

8111 2018-02-28 05:19:00 I’ve never seen such heavy duty investigative reporting !!! 
8112 2018-02-28 05:18:59 Jojoba oil? ? ?

Bener ya? Awas aja nanti kalo tetep lupa, nanti aku gigit! Cubit aja deh
8113 2018-02-28 05:18:55 Hey I have some castor oil!! I’ll use it again. Thanks!!
8114 2018-02-28 05:18:22 Wear leather gloves, I even put a pair of woven gloves inside with little oil on them. If you don't do this your hands are screwed. A good bowl of hot soup, an aspirin, and hot shower will have you at the top of your game.
8115 2018-02-28 05:17:31 Traditionally yes but the Industeially produced ones are kind of a question mark. Given that other fried foods like chips lost the oil on the package as an ingredient I’m guessing the ones I get are safe
8116 2018-02-28 05:17:28 Try tea tree oil
8117 2018-02-28 05:17:20 Try coconut oil for a natural product and Fresh’s Rose Hydration line for a more effective one!
8118 2018-02-28 05:17:03 Hahaha. The bunny will now single handedly change the course of the tater war by doing what no bunny has done before... he will accidentally drop them potatoes in a pan of frying oil, hence inadvertently inventing the fries and saving everyone from the war & boiled potatoes 
8119 2018-02-28 05:17:02 Why are these people being arrested when it's the oil company that's continuing construction despite a court ordered injunction?
8120 2018-02-28 05:16:44 I’ve been giving her coconut oil
8121 2018-02-28 05:16:39 Where the hell is @27MilanLucic

8125 2018-02-28 05:16:06 Wow I’m so glad I only have one more year as a student in the Oklahoma public school system because legislatures and people in power care more about the oil industry’s pockets than my constitutional right to a quality education

Apparently it's a tasty treat when high on ones own exuberance.
8128 2018-02-28 05:15:27 They don't care what happens to the Myanmar people. Haven't you got it yet? They want the oil which is going to China.
8129 2018-02-28 05:15:25 It happened much before 2014

It's the right of Dassault to select Reliance.

And what's that Bull shit about Oil prices.

8141 2018-02-28 05:14:06 I’d get a job where they let me put gas and oil in their stupid cars, and they’d pay me a salary for it, and I’d build me a little cabin somewhere with the dough I made and live there for the rest of my life.

8142 2018-02-28 05:13:40 It means if we can go in and take oil, that we need, of what belongs in a foreign country, we're setting ourselves up for problems that roll in after.

8144 2018-02-28 05:13:35 Perhaps it's just me but I see a lot of milenials running around making sure they have good beard oil and the latest craft beer in hand. Are they planning the future or looking after the now? #honestquestion
8145 2018-02-28 05:13:08 True. I still don't think that pouring oil into their already raging fire is a good idea.
8146 2018-02-28 05:13:04 とりあえず本棚全部探したけど見つからないってもう捨てた以外の可能性なくない？？？？

8152 2018-02-28 05:12:19

8154 2018-02-28 05:12:04 I'm so sorry to hear that you have Fibro Lady Gaga! I've had it for 45 years, CFS & Chronic Migraines, and disabled because of them. My 2 oldest children have it, my 2 youngest are showing they will get it. I wish you the best! Topical Magnesium oil seems to help, D3 with K2 also
8155 2018-02-28 05:12:03 snub (snail rub) oil into her skin
8156 2018-02-28 05:11:51 I used my moisturizing body oil after my bath and now I'm full of regret... slippery regret.

I do smell amazing though, so there's that.
8157 2018-02-28 05:11:50 Here it is — So they say with the amount of corn it takes to make one cup of oil, it could feed the avgerge American family for a year, but frankly I don’t want to eat that much corn in one year
8158 2018-02-28 05:11:48 Thank you. I didn't know that they still sold castor oil. I tried sleeping in a brace but it didn't help.
8159 2018-02-28 05:11:05 That particular kind of snake oil was found to contain lead too. I bet his skin got so red because he's taking too much niacin. "Super Male Vitality" indeed.

8166 2018-02-28 05:09:43 Castor oil packs topically, magnesium and b vitamins orally are miracles for nerve and soft tissue injuries. Deep massage of forearms (not palm side, other side) heals carpal tunnel. Hope you heal soon!

8182 2018-02-28 05:05:34 if you want super smooth, hydrated skin when you wake up in the morning, put lots of coconut oil on your face before you go to sleep and it soaks it all in

8184 2018-02-28 05:05:15 Such a fragile and scientifically incredible land, there’s species that ONLY exist there which we could learn so much from, to lose that over oil is irresponsible.
8185 2018-02-28 05:04:53 Whatever the Sharks did in ther Intermission, Oil needs to do now.
8186 2018-02-28 05:04:46 This oil has me feeling good just chilling in my bed haha
8187 2018-02-28 05:04:32 Wow ... Do you think Veterans know about the Oil Refineries your father built for the Communists in the 1920's and the Oil Refineries your father built for the Nazi's in the 1930's ? ... You Koch's are quite the patriots... NOT !
8188 2018-02-28 05:04:25 My mom just hid her bfs oil and he just walked in and was like where the fuck is it, ALEX?! And my moms just laughing in the background 
8189 2018-02-28 05:03:43 You think an eyelid to be an oil.
8190 2018-02-28 05:03:23 You can use Hot water still. Get you some organic oils and rub them on your skin, like vitamin E, or an organic coconut oil. I use a little lotion then pour some vitamin e or tea tree oil in there and rub it all together. Works like a charm
8191 2018-02-28 05:03:19 Wow ... Do you think Veterans know about the Oil Refineries your father built for the Communists in the 1920's and the Oil Refineries your father built for the Nazi's in the 1930's ? ... You Koch's are quite the patriots... NOT !

8193 2018-02-28 05:02:56 So many false flags.Terrorists are a machination created to frighten us into allowing the stealing of resources. Now that Russia is opposing the oil grab in Syria and that the oilygarchs and criminal bankers are salivating over Iran, the narrative has changed.
8194 2018-02-28 05:02:42 Sorry to hear Warm Vanilla Sugar Lotion is not the same fragrance as you remembered, Lisa. Our Super Smooth Lotion is infused with Shea Butter and Coconut Oil, but suggest trying this in the Body Cream which has not changed formula. We'll share your feedback with our Team.

8211 2018-02-28 05:00:14 Frankincense oil reduces symptoms associated with menstruation and menopause by balancing hormone levels. It can help relieve pain, cramps, constipation, headaches, anxiety, nausea, fatigue and mood swings.
8212 2018-02-28 05:00:12 OIL bears beware. On 20.02.18 OPEC said the 14-member producers’ group is working on a plan for a formal alliance with ten other petrostates aimed at propping up oil prices for the foreseeable future. If it comes to anything, it could be OPEC’s most ambitious venture in decades.

8243 2018-02-28 04:55:48 Best advice I ever got was to stay out of the sun. I was slathering on spf18 when all the other girls were using corn oil. I go from pasty white to burnt red in about 10 minutes. I do have a little sun damage on my face, but it’s minimal. Thank goodness.

8280 2018-02-28 04:47:19 Yes - I was shocked that it was used liberally not just for frying but as a replacement for ghee in the curry sauce. A lot of oil!
8281 2018-02-28 04:47:15 The oil of olives? Delish. The fruit? Not so much. It's a piece vs. whole thing.

8292 2018-02-28 04:45:12 good morning. They should ban the oil industry. Unfortunately everyone's pension will then go tits up!
8293 2018-02-28 04:45:11 This is half the reason the oil are so much worse this year. The only explanation is Vegas money. Don't talk about it lol.
8294 2018-02-28 04:45:05 I do too. They're professional hockey players, not actors. What does everyone expect? Is it bad writing?

8297 2018-02-28 04:44:57 use witch hazel at night during your skin care routine, it’s an astringent so it can strip your skin of oils if you use it too often. You can try to make a spray with witch hazel and rose water but make sure it’s 100% rose water and maybe put a small amount of tea tree oil in it

8327 2018-02-28 04:39:53 @NHL your refs are a fucking joke!
8328 2018-02-28 04:39:53 I use coconut oil as a moisturizer. I exfoliate with honey & sugar w/ a few drops of tea tree oil. I just use dove soap as a cleanser only because it doesn’t irritate my skin or dries it out and it’s sensitive and okay to use.
8329 2018-02-28 04:39:46 いや、月締があるからアウト(・ω・)
8330 2018-02-28 04:39:42 This cracks me up. Some people benefit from smoking so just the oil is ridiculous. Legalize the full spectrum for everyone to benefit from it or leave it the way it is. We will smoke either way. Everybody has a medical marijuana !
8331 2018-02-28 04:39:31 Alaska is purple not red. But bc the Koch Bros bought Sullivan his seat & have supported Don Young for 40 years & Lisa Murkowski. We have so many military bases that are allowed to vote along with brought in miners & oil workers. They outnumber Alaskans. 30 days residency to vote
8332 2018-02-28 04:39:18 He would whip your snake oil ass
8333 2018-02-28 04:39:14 I watched a show recently about a chef who travels to rural India to cook and they poured in loads of what I imagine was cheap soybean oil into the curry.

8336 2018-02-28 04:38:39 Oof, I'm 6 months overdue on my oil change. My last one was over a year ago.
8337 2018-02-28 04:38:35 Tonight I made chicken breast stuffed with provolone and spinach and a little garlic and I fried it in some olive oil and some more garlic and a small bit of butter
When this protein hits me it’s over for u bitches
8338 2018-02-28 04:38:32 And the more oil explorations at the Chad region. 
The more money saved
8339 2018-02-28 04:38:25 That and Axe oil are God's greatest gift to all head aches.
8340 2018-02-28 04:38:09 I need to get a oil change & a new tire tomorrow after work.
8341 2018-02-28 04:38:03 Bruh stfu!!  i saw your daddy at auto zone that boy giving me free oil he was like wassup d! Move home bruh
8342 2018-02-28 04:37:53 Makes about as much sense as some moron donating to your travel expense gofundme ... only a true dipshyte progressive troglodyte would go for that pitch. You are one helluva snake oil salesman there squirt. Well played, well played

8346 2018-02-28 04:37:07 Where is all the oil money? Your corrupt KRG stole it. When you lie about facts its easy to see your bias. Why don't you have any good roads trying to travel in Kurdistan is like traveling 100 years ago.
8347 2018-02-28 04:37:01 それは怒られて当然(・ω・)
8348 2018-02-28 04:36:50 my point is bigger than the article!!! If don't want to see that too bad I  will say this one last time Were it not for the MIC, Big Oli and Big Auto=slowing down progress we would even be using oil and gas that the f-ing point period
8349 2018-02-28 04:36:45 Yes, they are. They go together like oil and water 
8350 2018-02-28 04:36:09 If for some reason that doesn't work, I strongly suggest using a drop or two of doTERRA lemon essential oil. #Magic

8353 2018-02-28 04:35:42 Car insurance is such a acam. If Im paying over $100 a month then the company should pay for any and every repair or maintenance. New brakes, oil changes, windshield wipers, everything! I want total coverage!
8354 2018-02-28 04:35:32 Is it just me or does trump always look like he just stuck his head in a hot oven?
8355 2018-02-28 04:35:05 @DrBobHealthline My brother needs to gain his consciousness, he lost oxygen for 10-15 min. We started him on fish oil and dmso treatments. Any other suggestions or some advice? Love your show and the advice you give. Thanks!
8356 2018-02-28 04:35:00 So, halve acorn squash, remove seeds, place on a cookie sheet lined with foil, sprinkle lightly with olive oil, place ½ tablespoon butter & brown sugar in each cavity, still with S&P, roast for 55 minutes at 400°, DEVOUR! The best.
8357 2018-02-28 04:34:58 agreed re Sydney.. and nope re Oil deals! lol
8358 2018-02-28 04:34:46 Anybody have a good brand for vitamin E oil?
8359 2018-02-28 04:34:33 exectly. that what I mean. we have soil so fertize that compareable to our neighbour thailand but still we always have food shortage while our neighbour has food surplus. Why? because we focus more or should I said too much on industrial and palm oil.
8360 2018-02-28 04:34:30 Against gay marriage, pro deep sea oil drilling, thinks dolphins are fish, not for conservation, does not deliver promises, only cares for those profiting from housing crisis, thinks it’s ok to ask your female deputy to get your water, and rude to @JohnJCampbell #nzpol #badchoice

8367 2018-02-28 04:32:57 Bet they use gun oil for lube.

8372 2018-02-28 04:32:07 ทำไมอัพเกมไม่ได้อ่ะ
8373 2018-02-28 04:31:50 Went to Auffenberg Auto Mall to get a oil change and have my check engine light checked. My car is a 2017 with 8000+ miles and they showed the problem. It was a $ 15 part and they wanted to charge me $300+ to fix it. I ended up reusing the part and fixed it in 5 minutes.
8374 2018-02-28 04:31:49 I speak for the majority Sara. I really liked having Rick as my Consevative representative. I think he would have done great things for us and the UCP, even though he lacks any insight into economics, the oil and gas industry, or environmental issues.
8375 2018-02-28 04:31:15 Wow, somebody made a car that runs on coconut oil?
8376 2018-02-28 04:31:06 Anyone good oil tycoon investors!
Please give me money!
8377 2018-02-28 04:31:03 "Food is the best medicine." Vitamin E supplements are also problematic, @chriskresser says. They can promote heart disease. Get your Vitamin E from food, such as spinach, kale and sunflower seeds! Also throw some olive oil on those - fat increases bioavailability! #osherminimed
8378 2018-02-28 04:31:03 allergic to peanut oil, they use it for everything.
8379 2018-02-28 04:31:01 I got a little bit of tea tree oil residue near/in my eye. #HotMessAneesa
8380 2018-02-28 04:30:57 Even when we're drilling deeper oil wells next door?
8381 2018-02-28 04:30:38 You are absolutely right. I have an oil but it’s bleh
8382 2018-02-28 04:30:23 Which game?
8383 2018-02-28 04:30:08 The same antiseptic qualities also make frankincense oil a useful preventive measure against oral issues, like bad breath, toothaches, cavities, mouth sores, and other infections.
8384 2018-02-28 04:30:06 I could watch that all next.
8385 2018-02-28 04:30:05 You bet it gets to me. Lol. I'll have to go out prepared with oil
8386 2018-02-28 04:29:54 Loud it
8387 2018-02-28 04:28:43 อยู่ในเฟสน้ำมัน ชึ่งก็ต้องใช้ remover ประเภท oil มาช่วยดึงออกไป ใช้หลัก ลิโปฟิลริก เข้าช่วย ทั้งนี้ทั้งนั้น ถ้าหากเราล้างไม่สะอาดมันก็จะทำให้ยังหลงเหลืออยู่ที่หน้าของเรา ก็จะก่อให้เกิดสิวต่างไปขึ้น หน้าก็จะพัง เพราะฉนั้น จริงๆแล้ว ซิลิโคนไม่อันตรายต่อหน้าเราครับ
8388 2018-02-28 04:28:27 @ColleenRowan1 deliciously chilly outside & smells like it might rain,should be going out to 'thing' but soaking in hot scented oil bath w/windows cracked to let in the yummy chill & smell also sounds good...contrasts. I'd do both but work in AM : (  maybe can do both...decisions
8389 2018-02-28 04:28:01 Canada knows how to bring oil to tidewater safety .We've been doing it 4 many decades . These green people are out of touch with how the real world functions . You are obstructionists
8390 2018-02-28 04:27:51 @27MilanLucic hey you will get a few goals before the end of the season. Oil country believes in you. Keep pushing
8391 2018-02-28 04:27:34 โอ้ยเอวลอยด้วย
8392 2018-02-28 04:27:31 Basic skincare routine like aiken(moisturizer and toner) , nutox sunscreen , biore oil based cleanser and water based cleanser (ponds)
8393 2018-02-28 04:27:26 Oh and stay away from sesame or truffle oil 
8394 2018-02-28 04:27:09 In my dying days, I’ll burn brighter than the oil burns the day. The day smudges into night, the horizon burns. You’ll find me there, unrecognizable, distant. I’m not gone, just on the other side, waking others up, to start their day. I’ll burn brighter than the sun burns the day

8402 2018-02-28 04:25:55 Not exactly food but kat litter is great for removing oil stains in the garage.  Even better, leave some fresh litter on the garage floor under the engine, ready to be swept up if a leak should occur.
@joliekerr
8403 2018-02-28 04:25:48 In the oven? Nonstick spray then oil? Then you can put them on napkin fresh off pan to drain extra oil?

8406 2018-02-28 04:25:32 Not in a good mood so I’m just going to take myself to bed with my lavender essential oil and call it a night.
8407 2018-02-28 04:25:31 I stand by what I said! There has been talk of cars that run on water since the 50's and cars that could get 30 plus miles to the gallon since the early 70's-why don't we have them? bc Big Oil and Big auto don't want us to!!
8408 2018-02-28 04:24:55 I don’t have satellite. @SIRIUSXM screwed me for over $350 and refused to *credit* my account for their error. 
Hey @amazon ask Sirius  how well I boycott- 5 years & going!  Ask Shell oil too. 24 years. Ask Chick-fil-A, 6 years. 
Just thought I’d throw that in. #BoycottNRA
8409 2018-02-28 04:24:54 Thanks to my ability to get oil all over my clothes in conspicuous places, I now have to change my shirt before heading back to work. Usually I manage to smear my face, which is much easier to remove.

One of those days.

8439 2018-02-28 04:18:54 its sad that snake oil is the classic example of a fictional product that doesnt exist, cuz what if it did exist?

I feel as if I am becoming a gentle little lavender bud 

My heart is so warm
8448 2018-02-28 04:17:11 that is BS. the oil industry runs Alberta,  dictates policy, sets royalties and reaps massive subsidies.

even if gov't put in appropriate taxation, big oil would have extorted it's extra share.

anyone that thinks Albertans or their gov't is calling the shots is delusional.
8449 2018-02-28 04:16:55 You can’t be that retarded! If they refined that shit in Alberta fuel would be cheaper  of course we don’t trust Alberta anymore so we will import our oil from overseas and build our own $10 billion refinery lol

8454 2018-02-28 04:16:28 Libya was once the most prosperous nations in the region even with a dictator at the helm. Gaddafi wanted to get away from the petrodollar and start trading oil for gold. He didn't last long after that.
8455 2018-02-28 04:16:28 Tingin ko mukhang high risk-high reward player ka,master. hehe. Mga narratives na umiikot ay joint oil exploration w/china (PXP,BRN,APX, even AB). Then mga 3rd telecom plays (ECP,HVN.STR,NOW,TBGI). Rotation ang mga rich gamblers/speculators.

8607 2018-02-28 03:54:11 #protip: This is laughable to women who already drank Blue and/or Black label- we don't need no stinkin' girly label, and now you've got the idiot feminists riled up. Ah well, I've been more on a single malt Islay kick lately anyway.
8608 2018-02-28 03:53:36 I mean most of us will get meats and stuff to grill and fruits . But you can’t depend on me to remember Flour and Olive oil lol. 
8609 2018-02-28 03:53:34 I love when I nair then top it off with baby oil I be wanting to walk around the house ass naked
8610 2018-02-28 03:52:44 also bought Indian Oil. Hopefully the bonus shares will be issued before March. In any case it fell in sympathy and should recover
8611 2018-02-28 03:52:40 I imagine meeting my wife going something like we both reach for the coconut oil at the same time in the local Whole Foods
8612 2018-02-28 03:52:27 Thanks to oil prices from 120 per barrel to less than  30/ barrels fir years . People switched to petrol.
8613 2018-02-28 03:52:23 The oil rich Gulf Nations are responsible for financing of Muslim Brotherhood.
Ever since oil has been found in middle East, the spread of Islam has accelerated exponentially. Along with that the world has also seen sharp rise in terriost activities as well.

8616 2018-02-28 03:52:19 Ethanol supports many thousands of jobs, lowers the cost of fuel at the pump, improves engine performance and reduces emissions. And ethanol does it without govt subsidies, unlike oil refiners. What is the downside to ethanol?
8617 2018-02-28 03:52:09 thought this argan oil i bought was trash until i used it last night and came out with the curl pattern on swiiiiim
8618 2018-02-28 03:51:55 Let’s just say I don’t like him. Rubs me the wrong way there’s something about him that reminds me of Shylock. Sorry all I get is snake oil salesman
8619 2018-02-28 03:51:50 This is even more horrific. Exploiting and harrassing them in return for the aid is absolute shameful and it adds oil to the further mental agony that all such women and kids are going through by means of war. Painful to hear!
8620 2018-02-28 03:51:43 Arugula, local lettuce, home grown smoked  and pickled beets with curry spice, sliced almonds, orange bell pepper, goat cheese, harissa olive oil and Serrano balsamic vinegar #easy

8622 2018-02-28 03:50:54 i feel like nothing will humble you quicker than getting popped in the face with some hot ass oil while you’re cooking
8623 2018-02-28 03:50:52 Ok, thanks! At that rate almost every high CBD oil available is excluded from excise tax. That’s not ideal but the clarification is so key
8624 2018-02-28 03:50:33 lol he's being nice when he calls you a shit journalist and snake oil salesman, most people don't even consider you a journalist and all. If anything you really are is just shit salesman

8635 2018-02-28 03:48:40 This reminds me of the #10 fall in oil price towards the end of Jonathan regime. We collectively reject the emotional appeal, we will do same again. Bring the money, it's our right. But our votes? Mbano

8638 2018-02-28 03:48:04 “Steady oil prices and a wind-down in sanc­tions against Iran since the 2015 nu­clear deal have given the coun­try’s cler­i­cal gov­ern­ment a fresh in­flux of rev­enue—cash that U.S. of­fi­cials say Tehran is fun­nel­ing to­ward its al­lies through­out the re­gion.”
8639 2018-02-28 03:47:58 KSA has immense availability of oil. What has affected is their business on oil. Now they have a burden on them infact a debt a bad GDP growth. So Kingdom looking to diversify their business into entertainment+sports etc. For this they badly has to shed conservative image.

8678 2018-02-28 03:43:45 You must live in Austin, because Trumps the man in my area! Hell, he's even popular in the oil & gas fields with the Hispanics (legal or illegal), because we are booming and they are making good money feeding their families.
8679 2018-02-28 03:43:44 I like to cook fresh spinach in a pan with olive oil & red pepper then break a runny egg all over the top  sometimes throw some sweet potato or charred tomatoes in there too! 
8680 2018-02-28 03:43:41 True, but they turned Nolan into their #1 D(Ozolinsh), Sundin into Lemieux (a downgrade but he did win a Conn Smythe...) and Lindross into half their team (including Forsberg).
I'd say the Oil have a lot of catching up to do.

8731 2018-02-28 03:34:56 Big Tobacco and Big Oil are being sued because they knew about the dangers of their products but lied about them to promote their business models, gun manufacturers as far as I know have never pretended that their products were not deadly.

8735 2018-02-28 03:34:41 yep, it’s used for EOR — a process that both leaks CO2 (estimated 30%) and of course results in more oil being burnt. 
8736 2018-02-28 03:34:38 Now to drench my hair in coconut oil & deep conditioner while I got a face mask on
8737 2018-02-28 03:34:31 Em No Not true ERDOGAN is Isis SUPPORTER His ENTIRE Family have supported DAESH IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER AND the ERDOGANS bought Oil from DAESH AND QUITE LIKELY CHEMICALS from NKorea  to use on Kurds The day will come LUV when ALL will be held accountable and will rot in jail U2
8738 2018-02-28 03:34:19 So THAT'S how you get them to quit leaking oil!
8739 2018-02-28 03:33:56 I don’t have a skin care routine. I just use cetaphil, rose water, and coconut oil. That’s it, that’s all. I never had acne. I just get pimples from time to time.

8747 2018-02-28 03:32:44 You haven’t thought that through. The selling of licenses is big bucks, oil revenue would go to the Scottish Treasury post Indy.

8815 2018-02-28 03:23:22 I find if I prep the skin extra well (oil, moisturizer, hydrating primer) I don’t need powder for longevity. It just adds unnecessary cakeyness. Only under the eyes and on the cheeks if I use powder contour on top to prevent blotchiness. Plus it always looks like skin
8816 2018-02-28 03:23:21 all this prep is just for one unit... i need to take a bath in oil........

8825 2018-02-28 03:21:38 when people include coconut oil in their skincare routine i shiver at the thought of that
8826 2018-02-28 03:21:37 That's fantastic. Heartbreaking 2 see such a young person lying there like that. God bless his heart & his future. I wish his medical team would look into getting him started on a medical grade program of quality fish oil, vitamin C and Curcummin. It would help promote healing.
8827 2018-02-28 03:20:59 My “I don’t feel like being creative but I’m hungry tho” meal is to chop chicken thighs with tomatoes, spices and peppers and cook in imported olive oil and have with basmati rice.

8865 2018-02-28 03:16:30 Climate change is the biggest risk for water security, as glaciers that feed major rivers are receding fast. Clean river supplies are another serious sustainability issue in that area. Wars over oil are a greater risk the longer we defer de-carbonisation.

8901 2018-02-28 03:13:10 A girl at work today asked me what highlighter I used because I was so glowy. Like girl no, that’s just oil.

8909 2018-02-28 03:12:08 The CBD/THC ratio would be the same in the extracted oil. If the dose of oil is given in g of dried bud equivalents, the corresponding dose of THC is the same. Will this hold up?

8915 2018-02-28 03:11:46 Another day in the pilot plant making flakes. Modified the process parameters to get better products with oil added. Eventually replied back to Ross on the deferred enrollment. Eric seems to forget to ask VP on the budget for next year. Anyway, relieved and may be a good decision

8918 2018-02-28 03:11:23 If you have east coast votes you already have majority to form a government in canada. Alberta should understand their position and stop relying on federal govt. Without oil money Alberta have no leverage....they must look at south..
8919 2018-02-28 03:10:59 I'm always offended when some women say they've friendzoned me, when I'm deadass sure I didn't want to be more than friends with you

8921 2018-02-28 03:10:44 Chili powder qty is per your kharam level. I used about 12 tsp for the 3 big mangoes.  Turn the heat low and let it cook until oil separates out. Earlier I had dry roasted methi seeds and ground it.
8922 2018-02-28 03:10:34 ナルルちゃーん、俺の机ちょっと片付けて…くれないよねー
8923 2018-02-28 03:10:32 An 18 year old at this time couldn’t possibly know what snake oil, obviously parroting what he’s told. I mean, when’s the last time anyone used the term snake oil??
8924 2018-02-28 03:10:22 Well... Yeah. 'cause who the hell uses FedEx if you aren't getting a deal? Not when you can go to the post office and ship for ten bucks less. I'm surprised that FedEx has even stayed in business. This is why I call bs on this so called boycott. These people aren't using FedEx.
8925 2018-02-28 03:10:19 おっぱいって結局は脂肪だろ？少し胸についてるからって僕を巨乳キャラにするなよ。

8932 2018-02-28 03:09:46 So are you just now realizing that Trump is a liar? If you're not representing big oil or coal, he doesn't understand or care? Here's the bottom line: Trump only cares about himself. Stop sucking up.

8940 2018-02-28 03:08:55 Now you should know money and work don’t mix very well it’s like oil and water step away 
8941 2018-02-28 03:08:48 Why would Trump run for reelection, Bush and Cheney where globalist crooks who benefited the oil companies, and helliburton .Obama is a liberal America hating,  racist ,anti law enforcement ,terrorist sympathizer. Trump is a American first president who msm hates, pick your side

8945 2018-02-28 03:08:43 Term limits would limit anyone being bought by any organization. Widen your search of lobbyists. Big oil, pharmaceutical, tobacco, unions, farming, etc. There are very very few politicians who haven’t been bought by big business. Corruption runs deep. Be careful.
8946 2018-02-28 03:08:41 No, it is not. We have under cover air marshals and in some cases armed pilots. Arming teachers solves more problems than it creates.
8947 2018-02-28 03:08:27 You can tell they are used to govt monopolies.

8951 2018-02-28 03:08:08 Stop putting coconut oil on your face

8958 2018-02-28 03:07:15 I can't believe in this day and age, vandals at traffic lights are still running up to trucks and squirting oil on the hubs and wheels!
8959 2018-02-28 03:07:11 Noble bill proposal. The world must be made free for democracy. Venezuelan government has been abismal at leading  its people’s and  managing resources. Hyperinflation concurrent with starvation, all while sitting an abundant oil supply. Complete mismanagement of a dictator.
8960 2018-02-28 03:07:01 Yes! It's a snake oil conman trove!
8961 2018-02-28 03:06:52 Bush did 9/11 and nobody is willing to admit it but me! The electric car was killed by Walt Disney! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
8962 2018-02-28 03:06:50 I've heard about honey. My boyfriend's mom actually gave me some raw honey, I just wouldn't know about how to apply it to the skin without making a mess. xD

Coconut oil unfortunately makes me break out, but it's awesome for removing make up!
8963 2018-02-28 03:06:40 An essential oil. Helps headaches lol
8964 2018-02-28 03:06:35 やったーーーーーー！！！！！！！！！！！！

8967 2018-02-28 03:05:54 Different skin type different regime. Double cleansing je sama steps. Oil cleanser org pakai atas dry face ye anak anak pastu bilas pastu facial wash low pH. Double cleansing org buat malam je. Pagi tu cuci mcm biasa sampai la sunblock. Malam org tk pakai sunblock. Bazir.
8968 2018-02-28 03:05:53 As long as CNN is writing his tweets, shouldn't they edit them for dumb as well...?
8969 2018-02-28 03:05:38 My hair is currently drenched in coconut oil in hopes that I can come back from this
8970 2018-02-28 03:05:29 I think it's higher than that. 3 X (oil + gas + coal), by weight, if all sent to CCS.

8975 2018-02-28 03:04:31 yeh that's basically what I did. I just went online and just tried all the shit that people said was good. My eyes still hurt a bunch all the time, but the flaxseed oil, the artificial tears (you can get it at Smith's), and microwaving a rag works best for me.
8976 2018-02-28 03:04:24 You know, people forget Ab has 2nd most conventional oil reserves in  (SK #1)... LOTS of profit at $50/bbl... just need 2 things:

•way to ship it out

Ab prov election May 2019

8977 2018-02-28 03:04:13 In Social Media the “squeaky wheel” gets the oil. You have to put yourself out there... - Jessica Northey #Quote
8978 2018-02-28 03:04:08 Or InfoWars! Wanna buy some snake oil?
8979 2018-02-28 03:04:06 The oil is actually coming from Alaska via tankers through the Juan de Fuca Strait to refineries at Cherry Point in Washington State.
8980 2018-02-28 03:04:04 より可能性を感じるのは？
8981 2018-02-28 03:04:02 Oil
8982 2018-02-28 03:03:39 Another thing that's good for skin is pure, organic honey. Washing with that a few times a weak and pure coconut oil is good. It soothes, cleans and softens skin naturally.
8983 2018-02-28 03:03:24 You might mention what they sell it for (oil recovery perhaps?) and total world usage of that. There's always Coca Cola. Still, a wee bit will be left over from the 20 billion tonnes or so of CO2 waste.
8984 2018-02-28 03:03:18 Stop getting medical advice from memes!  And stop buying snake oil from @infowars!
8985 2018-02-28 03:02:59 US markets down about 1.25%.

8997 2018-02-28 03:00:43 Under no circumstances do you mention that you're there for work and definitely don't have anything to do with oil.

8999 2018-02-28 03:00:38 At Wounded Knee they knew US politicians were buying and selling Tribal lands with their votes in favor of oil,  gas, uranium and European expansion. #YellowHairGotWhatHeDeserved
9000 2018-02-28 03:00:35 My eyes have been extremely fucked for years and are stupidly dry. I get artificial tears and I also occasionally get prescriptions for cholinergic drugs to help produce tears. Every day I use a hot wet rag a few times to help dissolve oil that is blocking tear production.
9001 2018-02-28 03:00:33 Personal care brands like Aveeno and Oil of Olay use #USsoy in their products. Current ads for the Aveeno Positively Radiant body collection promote the moisture-rich power of soy. #Cropportunity #Classic18

9008 2018-02-28 03:00:07 @Rosenthal5280 paul- then explain why you killed the fracking bill that would give communities local control over fracking.  Stop taking money from oil and gas industry.
9009 2018-02-28 03:00:02 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!

9012 2018-02-28 02:59:55 for a sense of scale, the @IEA’s (unrealistic) projections for #CCS would have carbon industries inject CO2 underground at a volumetric rate roughly equal to the extraction rate of the _entire_ oil industry.

that’s hopelessly unrealistic IMHO.
9013 2018-02-28 02:59:53 Hell yeah.

9036 2018-02-28 02:56:33 Jared Kushner’s level of expertise in foreign relations is that of a naive girl who walks into an auto repair shop for an oil change and leaves with thousands of dollars worth of unnecessary work
9037 2018-02-28 02:56:21 That ended with the Soviet’s stuffing Nazis into oil drums and setting them on fire.

9043 2018-02-28 02:55:33 The price in BC is going up because there is not enough refineries, not because of a lack of oil. 

Get used to it. Dont whine about the high prices either.

9057 2018-02-28 02:54:08 It’s not the companies fault, it’s the food department that banned the use of the oil or whatever.
9058 2018-02-28 02:54:06 Putting a few drops of eucalyptus oil in my bong has been my best idea yet 
9059 2018-02-28 02:53:42 Yeah well they suck
9060 2018-02-28 02:53:36 Casi se quedan sin oil ...
9061 2018-02-28 02:53:28 But then some K-Pop fans just want to throw more oil into an open fire... Not just for block b but for any member of other group that is "problematic" on their eyes except their faves certainly 
9062 2018-02-28 02:53:17 also put coconut oil in ya hair before
9063 2018-02-28 02:53:12 *usual
9064 2018-02-28 02:53:03 The point of boycotts is to take money away from these Corp, oil, and groups that have bought our Congress. also to send them a message. It’s our $$. You see what has happened w the boycott the NRA action. Businesses are jumping ship fast because of the threat of losing $$.
9065 2018-02-28 02:53:02 Used peppermint oil for the first time on my scalp and I’m in love shit feels amazing

9067 2018-02-28 02:52:34 Bruv, my little sister literally came up to my dad and Inand was like, "so 9/11 was a scam and we've been playing ourselves for years, all of this drama is due to global white supremacy and the quest for oil in the Middle East" ... she's 10.
9068 2018-02-28 02:52:28 A question: have Americans been compensated for the oil wealth being extracted from our land - the extractors reap all the profit but we as Americans pay them for their efforts without profiting @fawfulfan

9071 2018-02-28 02:52:25 This is all true and will all be ignored by our regressive leftist governments. Oil is the equivalent of zyklon-B in the mind of most.
9072 2018-02-28 02:52:19 Guys, a thought: what if that whole NRA argument was exactly the same as the clean coal argument. And the oil argument. Almost as if...rich people are scamming the hell out of us to get richer! Holy shit!

9077 2018-02-28 02:52:08 The surplus is mostly oil (trade deficit) kinda like buying Girl Scout Cookies their over priced but it makes you feel good helping the little girl next door but ultimately makes the association huge $ just follow the Rat trail it’s going to Canadian elites not goods and services

9089 2018-02-28 02:51:01 I should get coconut oil then. I thought butter will work?
9090 2018-02-28 02:50:58 that oil light must’ve been on
9091 2018-02-28 02:50:52 It's okay. Even if you use the tacky putty shit the oil from your fingers gets in there and it seeps through the poster a bit, so they're getting dinged and won't remain "cherry" no matter what you do.
9092 2018-02-28 02:50:47 Hahahhahaa pakai bio oil lah! Piak kang 
9093 2018-02-28 02:50:45 Really? I am sooooooo sick of this stuff. Don't we have more important issues in Colorado, like the I-70 corridor traffic, oil & gas battles, high rents, overpopulation........the list goes on and on. Let's report on meaningful things. #TooMuch
9094 2018-02-28 02:50:41 Cutting onions while watching @QueerEye might make me dehydrate from all the tears. Thank god @antoni taught me the coconut oil trick! I’m shook by that one STILL!
9095 2018-02-28 02:50:40 At the current rate of oil consumption, we will run out of oil in about 39 years.

9101 2018-02-28 02:50:15 Unless it's real truffles..take the truffle oil out.
9102 2018-02-28 02:50:02 That oil painting is that old?
9103 2018-02-28 02:49:56 Nope
9104 2018-02-28 02:49:42 And get an oil change because I’ve been neglecting my little baby
9105 2018-02-28 02:49:39 It’s hair oil that smells like birthday cake 
9106 2018-02-28 02:49:37 Best is coconut oil cinnamon and espresso
9107 2018-02-28 02:49:33 Is that an extract or an essential oil?
9108 2018-02-28 02:49:24 A9 - First of all, I'm a FL native and moved to CO 10 years ago.  I will advise all of you NOT, repeat, NOT to go to FL in the summer.  If you must, you have to take an afternoon break at the pool.  Peppermint oil doused on your neck helps also.  #disfanchat
9109 2018-02-28 02:49:17 I can only assume the dots around it are drops of snake oil from security vendors?

9112 2018-02-28 02:48:53 Gov Abbott, where can we find out how much money you have received from the oil and gas industry?

9114 2018-02-28 02:48:40 I'm more concerned about Kennan in Washington courting Russian oil/gas money, declining to hold events highlighting persecution o Crimean Tatars, etc.
9115 2018-02-28 02:48:37 yeah my bros tell me the same shit lol, I own one I just don’t have oil
9116 2018-02-28 02:48:31 *sara pulls out olive oil* oh look rachel! it’s you- extra virgin!
9117 2018-02-28 02:48:27 Getting back on my dry brushing/oil pulling morning routine.
9118 2018-02-28 02:48:24 What type did you use? The original coconut oil works good for me but all the rest don’t. 
9119 2018-02-28 02:48:24 Niggas post snaps of themselves driving and all you see is mad different lights on like how about you go get gas, fill ya tires up, and get an oil change before that shit breaks down and you can’t make no more snaps
9120 2018-02-28 02:48:19 I just use neutrogena oil free acne wash/grapefruit or a black head scrub from cvs, at night i use vitamin e/tea tree oil and in the morning first aid beauty ultra repair cream! I used to use ambi fade cream it helped a bit too. But that’s it nothing too special

9122 2018-02-28 02:48:09 "I poured all 150 in to see what would happen and now the water looks like oil and the tub is stained"
9123 2018-02-28 02:47:54 I believe joint US-Israel air attack against Iran will happen soon. Iran will retaliate by blocking oil ship routes. That will expand the war.
9124 2018-02-28 02:47:36 Coconut oil tho taste bagunda curries ??
9125 2018-02-28 02:47:21 When Time tries to make "Pakoda" out of you, have patience to enjoy the dance on boiling oil.
#Lol #Pakoda
9126 2018-02-28 02:47:21 there's some stuff popping up but it seems like the company the ceo was in tanked because oil prices dropped so they had to drop projects. They had to lay off workers and the workers cannot leave the country without the company helping them (per their law??)
9127 2018-02-28 02:47:17 i have the same skin concern but i am yet to find the right moisturizer for me :/ i tried the oil balancing one and broke out

9133 2018-02-28 02:46:45 Exactly that Those up to the job are a second, maybe final line of defense, until police arrives. A perimeter defense is useless once the perimeter has been breached.

9135 2018-02-28 02:46:30 Chef Ramses cut up some potatoes, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was chicken, along with cheese.
9136 2018-02-28 02:46:29 @IMGoph you should read some of Paolo Bacigalupi's sci fi books, he kind of takes the oil and gas era to their logical conclusions.
9137 2018-02-28 02:46:10 Take a cold shower to reduce the swelling and heat you created by itching then as soon as you come out the shower put coconut oil
9138 2018-02-28 02:46:07 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, but government benefits.
9139 2018-02-28 02:46:05 Ok go back to reporting on Russian oil and smelly Ukrainian food
9140 2018-02-28 02:46:01 but, arms and ammunition supplies were dangerously low. The Arab threats of an oil embargo and trade boycott had effectively halted European munitions re-supply, so Meir turned her attention to the United States and the Nixon administration.
9141 2018-02-28 02:45:51 i need some oil to put on my edges...

any recommendations?
9142 2018-02-28 02:45:37 Now you are starting to get it. There are compromises.  Unless you live in BC, and glibly want to continue to use Alberta oil to fuel their cars and heat their homes. But thats it. None for overseas. 

How is the cost of gas in BC now? Get used to it.
9143 2018-02-28 02:45:27 Right see I'm allowed to shoot my hydrogenated soybean oil before I eat it while crying wistfully before the Confederate flag.

9146 2018-02-28 02:45:13 Still, you people (Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, Iran, Iraq, ARbs and other nearby countries) are just watching this attack @ Syria. As of now, this crucial attack is happening in Syria and you people are close enough to Syria where you too have oil in the country.  remember qayamat

9151 2018-02-28 02:44:38 Population control. Centralized resource rationing. Medical care rationing. Compensation for Palliative care vs curative medicine or regenerative care with a side of genocide over oil or water.
9152 2018-02-28 02:44:30 With the economic times we’re having, increased value in oil and lumber, service industries finding their feet and money bein made, is this not the time for a surplus? @jkenney @DaneLIoyd
9153 2018-02-28 02:44:29 Please tell your friend that she should be doing coconut oil pulling daily for her teeth/gums health. Hope she can get a local dentist to help her out and she can eat more. Always an option to blend soups, which is a good way to get the nourishment needed.

9158 2018-02-28 02:43:25 best is to get solar rolling as fast as possible in America - if costs can be shown to be better than Gas & oil, its game over - except for Gas & oil subsidies
9159 2018-02-28 02:43:24 God sealed the oil and coal under the ground to protect us from it, we break those seals and God's protection ends, the unpaid cost of carbon fuel continues to rise as does the tide, and the cost of wind and solar energy continues to be free, a blessing given to us by God.

Ridiculing a snake oil salesman whom by choice is profiteering from unproven, so called treatment of illnesses, that's called a warning to public health. Just like how we have all done to Big Tobacco. That's not bullying.

9170 2018-02-28 02:42:18 Does anyone else make skincare cocktails when they're feeling too lazy to go through the steps? like I mix an oil, a moisturizer, and a serum when I couldn't be bothered to do more than wash and moisturize
9171 2018-02-28 02:42:13 Oh this is interesting! I'm going to listen to this when I'm done with work.  Is there a right or wrong kind of fish oil to purchase? I've been intrested in starting that
9172 2018-02-28 02:42:05 India needs oil for its energy needs but Canadian Govt “values” are too high maintenance!

Indian govt’s position of ‘Look East & Middle East’ should serve for now. 

India & Canada together? Maybe some other time. Let’s try again in a decade!
9173 2018-02-28 02:41:59 I see. Sy now currently guna oil cleanser biore yg purple tuu and gel cleanser sy guna simple oil balancing jer. Aloe vera pulak awak guna brand apa ea? Awak sapu AV dulu pastu moisturizer ker atau mix sekali? Maaf banyak tanya 
9174 2018-02-28 02:41:57 This is perfect for Chris! Tell him I said, “Hello!” I can’t tell from the other pictures if I know the other boys or not. I am sure they are enjoying every minute learning about changing the oil in a car and changing a flat tire from a male mentor.
9175 2018-02-28 02:41:54 IS THOR OUT NOW? shit i need that money to get the oil change i needed back in december. x.x

9177 2018-02-28 02:41:31 Soak to get rid of sugar and extra starch. Start with cold oil. Bring up. Let water boil off while oil temp is relatively low. Pull when desired browness. Kiss of death is browning before boiling off water.

9182 2018-02-28 02:40:49 If it works I'd stick with that, clove oil is pretty strong tasting. It works though

9184 2018-02-28 02:40:34 40 years I have watched Labour and Tory Governments squander oil money. we have knew since 1970s roads were heading for gridlock, record homeless, record poverty.  stealing from the  the disabled . Do what your paymasters told you and leave. You are not smarter than your masters.

9188 2018-02-28 02:40:01 Dead skin cells of the body can be removed by applying mixture of olive oil and salt. Replacing salt with granulated sugar can work too.
9189 2018-02-28 02:40:01 "the rancid coconut oil incident" should be forgotten about.
9190 2018-02-28 02:40:01 Have you tried coconut oil
9191 2018-02-28 02:39:45 The hair oil has me....scratching my head.

9195 2018-02-28 02:39:24 Signing out! Game is too late for me! I will catch in the morning! Go Oil!
9196 2018-02-28 02:39:22 Coconut oil is really paying my bills.

9204 2018-02-28 02:38:05 Owwieee i had those and all that truly helped were painkillers until i had them removed. I really hope he he gets some relief. If they've broken the skin anywhere use clove oil. It numbs the area and works fairly deep. Enough relief to eat at the least
9205 2018-02-28 02:37:39 Middle aged women giving me advise on rinse or swish coconut oil for ten minutes every morning... first of all, who has 10 minutes to spare in the morning? Second, that’s why I got mouthwash and lastly GROSS
9206 2018-02-28 02:37:38 Jonathan Garner, @MorganStanley: Reduce OW in India further to 50bps from 150 bps. #Q3 weighed down by PSU banks & Oil cos. Higher #crude prices, elections & prospect of higher deficit are obstacles for the market. India ranks well on fundamentals, but valuations are not cheap
9207 2018-02-28 02:37:37 @maricobuzz  Your switch to sachet for Parachute hair oil is a good idea for travelling , but packing needs to be improved as the sachet leaked!!!!
9208 2018-02-28 02:37:26 You mean like taking to the streets in pink cat hats? Protesting with balaclavas carting sticks around?

9210 2018-02-28 02:37:11 My friend, speaking of God, you should share all your good with the poor, not oil companies right?
9211 2018-02-28 02:36:45 Burning of the midnight oil notwithstanding, starting a pot of coffee at 8:30 PM is probably not going to turn out the way I want it to.
9212 2018-02-28 02:36:40 And that was months before the oil spike!!
9213 2018-02-28 02:36:38 The Lord gives me new oil daily! I won’t complain.

9220 2018-02-28 02:35:26 Hoyer, Zinke is out to destroy our Lands & Parks. So, now he’s after our Oceans all for his gas/oil buddies. If we the people can see it why doesn’t Congress do something about it. The way DC is going we won’t own anything anymore.
9221 2018-02-28 02:35:16 I also have v dry skin! Have u ever tried cetaphil face wash??? It’s so basic but it’s helped with my skin sm & witch hazel n I use 100% argon oil and rose hip oil for moisturizing hope this helps a lil
9222 2018-02-28 02:35:13 Local businesses from Burnaby Abbotsford and the lower mainland also depend on the oil and gas industry as well all of Canada’s resource sectors. The big difference is other municipalities respect the taxpayers within them and are diligent in their in their processes

9224 2018-02-28 02:35:00 I got a box of lush stuff from johnny and I smell so good after my bath with my marshmallow oil
9225 2018-02-28 02:34:40 Pro-tip: lay the knot in a few drops of oil (olive or baby) and use pins to untangle. The oil lubricates the chain.

9230 2018-02-28 02:33:52 using jojoba oil right now but olive oil would probably work too
9231 2018-02-28 02:33:32 Also: gender politics and communism are like Oil and water. They don’t mix.
9232 2018-02-28 02:33:31 Ask my mother anything and her cure is olive oil. Cold? Drink Olive oil. Bad skin? Rub Olive oil on it. Headache? Drink Olive oil. Cancer? Olive oil

9234 2018-02-28 02:33:20 So many people actually cared about me getting burned by oil, I forgot what it felt like for someone to care 
9235 2018-02-28 02:33:14 Btw clove oil
9236 2018-02-28 02:33:05 Big Oil, Thunder Thorton, and Charlie Anderson arent opening up that checkbook....

9240 2018-02-28 02:32:11 Need a new fun way to answer "I don't understand how American voters chose/ choose a snake oil salesman" comments? Apparently Americans actually bought enough timeshares - I know, right! - to support an industry designed solely to get one out of a timeshare. #SawItComin

9241 2018-02-28 02:32:06 And for some diddling kids is okay. What’s the point of that statement?

9244 2018-02-28 02:31:48 Have you ever heard of the brand Boscia? (I get it from Sephora) They have an exfoliating scrub & a charcoal scrub that leaves your skin like amazingly soft. I usually apply coconut oil after than the Nivea lotion.
9245 2018-02-28 02:31:44 I want to learn about investing in Oil & Gas....
9246 2018-02-28 02:31:34 The album 10'000 days came out same year as cup run in 2006. I remember listening to Vicarious a few times when Oil won.

Drum roll....
9251 2018-02-28 02:30:31 King snake oil seller would be Jeff bezos of whole foods I thinks
9252 2018-02-28 02:30:18 OIL DIFF: 3.76 -> 3.78
9253 2018-02-28 02:30:14 Were you ever a conservative?  You sold snake oil to your constituents who thought they were electing a conservative and instead got someone who champions all of the liberal causes.  Arizona is counting the days until your departure.
9254 2018-02-28 02:30:10 I bet Trump calls him a "good man" now. Damn slimy snake oil salesman
9255 2018-02-28 02:30:09 A little bit of Frankincense oil goes a long way; it should not be ingested in large quantities as it can be toxic.

9257 2018-02-28 02:29:47 Blister the size of Tokyo on the ball of my foot during my first marathon  (pouring rain at the start)  left it alone and used lavender essential oil on it, applied several times. It never popped and healed within a few days
9258 2018-02-28 02:29:40 I tried Nivea and it didn’t work for me  but I should definitely try some coconut oil. This winter has been the worst for my skin

9268 2018-02-28 02:28:42 Putin and trump are partners in an international criminal enterprise. They are partners...trump is very willing to participate with putin. It is a business deal involving the election, the sanctions and oil. They are in bed together, so to speak

9275 2018-02-28 02:27:46 Accha..but with regards to stiched  clothes..on deepawali early morning don't you keep the new dresses near bhagwan? For e.g. we have gangai snaanam with gingelly oil and then Amma or paati will give us our new dresses kept near bhagwan
9276 2018-02-28 02:27:45 Which is precisely the reason why you train, train, train, train some more, and, oh, did I mention train? It's part of the job. Make it so. Anybody can pocket a gun. One needs to learn how to use it. Like driving a car. Any other non-trivial task.
9277 2018-02-28 02:27:37 From food that tastes salty without the health risk of adding salt, to bread that contains healthy fish oil but without any fishy aftertaste.

9282 2018-02-28 02:26:45 The why of Russia keeps stumping me, but everything seems to point back to oil, Middle East, the arctic and more.  China investing in South American recently, keep an eye on Venezualla.  Russia wants all the oil that’s left.  Trump is their puppet
9283 2018-02-28 02:26:43 Have you watched his show?

1. The fact that he mentions in the video being "oil checked" leads me to believe that he knows a bit about high school wrestling.

2. He loves MMA.

3. I think you should actually watch the video, and his show on the whole, before giving an opinion.
9284 2018-02-28 02:26:20 If NATO bombs Syria, forget it, wider way, overnight. It will be a criminal act too and the justifications are the usual lies that it's humanitarianism. Bullshit it is, it's about oil and control of the region.

9289 2018-02-28 02:25:28 I’m dumber for having read that. Thanks.
9290 2018-02-28 02:25:19 Eat less red meat! Beef Lamb pork ! Maybe just once a week is OK. No heavy paste OK. Just a simple pan seared steak with a little bit of salt pepper olive oil or butter. Or in steamboat. Make sure the base is not heavy taste or oily. A clear chicken or kelp soup base is perfect.
9291 2018-02-28 02:25:13 Wound wash/saline soak (easiest) and tiny bit of tee tree oil right after, and if i were you I’d put cotton pads in your sports bra to absorb any sweat and prevent harsh rubbing!
9292 2018-02-28 02:25:02 trade deficit is even worse when you adjust for the fact US oil production is up
9293 2018-02-28 02:24:28 That’s what the Jews thought when that small amount of oil lasted for 8 days
9294 2018-02-28 02:24:26 Don't add oil when you fry your bacon. Unless you're cool with soggy bacon. Or better yet, just oven bake your bacon.
9295 2018-02-28 02:24:21 ไปรับชนน.กันเยอะๆเลยนะ ฮืออออ ฝากรับเขาทีค่ะ นี่ไปไม่ได้
9296 2018-02-28 02:24:11 The economy is not doing great Jagmeet, many of my friends have lost their jobs. Why don’t you come out to Alberta & explain how we’re going to grow the economy when you’re opposed to pipelines & oil/gas development?
9297 2018-02-28 02:24:04 Akala ko mamamatay ako potek hahahaha literal na pumutok yung oil ng crispy pata!!!!
9298 2018-02-28 02:24:02 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
9299 2018-02-28 02:23:57 Also great for hold oil paint mixes so that you can reuse them in other project or dye blends or for setting frangrence blends i can think of a thousand uses off the top of my head.
9300 2018-02-28 02:23:56 Coconut oil and Nivea. Surprisingly the men one works wonders.
9301 2018-02-28 02:23:51 อีเชี่ยยยยยยยยยยยยยยย หื้ออวสานคอมจ้าทั้งโปรเจคทั้งสัมนาอยู่ในคอมทั้งหมด ร้องไห้งานหายอยากได้คืน

Documented abuse, yet Dems refuse to shut it down.
9303 2018-02-28 02:22:59 It seems that he is s puppet of the US interest groups especially those who want Alberta oil kept in the ground! He is nothing but a puppet on a string ..pretty wo- man to his preferred group !
9304 2018-02-28 02:22:58 Cod liver oil so nasty but it get the job done
9305 2018-02-28 02:22:53 Convenient but if it was crude (which it is) the protests would continue, none of the protests are based on science or history. This is all about jealousy and US oil interests pouring money into protest groups
9306 2018-02-28 02:22:36 You could use a little bit of ANY kind of oil. Gain some weight before stepping into the ring with the men, little boy. @infowars @alexjonesshows
9307 2018-02-28 02:22:28 I agree. Soon we all will be dipping our shrimp in motor oil. Alaska is finished as big oil moves in as coward big game hunters leave their carnege for bragging rights. Trump over turned President Obamas restrictions on oil drilling off the east coast, sad day for Maine lobsters
9308 2018-02-28 02:22:13 For dry eyes it is essential 2000mg to 3000 mg per day . Medicinal Ingredients
Fish Oil (Sardine, Mackerel, Anchovy) 1000 mg Yielding:
EPA (Eicosapentaenoic Acid).400 mg
DHA (Docosahexaenoic Acid).200 mg it takes 2 or3 months to feel the effects
9309 2018-02-28 02:22:08 Very high taxes, very high housing costs, high energy costs even with the oil subsidies, small homes and apartments, I prefer keeping my own money. My state of Texas pretty much stays out of your life & has a low cost of living. I prefer messy freedom. But it’s a pretty place.

9324 2018-02-28 02:20:37 Because driving is not as simple as push this and go. There's ignition, blinkers, lights, seat belts, oil lights, engine lights, pumping gas, changing a tire, changing brake pads, learning how to properly stop the vehicle, learning how to turn, learning how to drive in reverse
9325 2018-02-28 02:20:31 @nikocadoavocado I love 2 watch ur videos especially the recipe mukbangs. U just crack me up like ur fried rice recipe. U added a ton of oil. U always make me smile when I'm depressed. Nick, thanks a million for always being there for us. U are the best!! Iu.

9327 2018-02-28 02:20:17 In a drugged haze, Ted Cruz mistakenly tells Katrina Pierson that angry parents are drilling for oil. Alex Jones briefly says hello.
9328 2018-02-28 02:20:13 I’ve got 99 problems & coconut oil solved 85 of them 
9329 2018-02-28 02:20:10 I like Frankies oil 457 I like California olive ranch too. Those are both pretty available high quality options
9330 2018-02-28 02:20:08 What about them tires and oil ? Lol
9331 2018-02-28 02:20:02 What’s the theme this year? More funding of anti oil activist/researchers?? Maybe some divestment ‘research’.Just what industry  will this leftist arm of the bureaucracy spend our tax money fighting this year...can’t wait to see the results
9332 2018-02-28 02:19:48 Of course snake oil sellers still exists. Dr. Oz still has a show, right?
9333 2018-02-28 02:19:34 His snake oil customers do, too, so he's the perfect model for crazy fat guys that suck.

9343 2018-02-28 02:18:32 Sad to see a Reefer Madness prohibitionist spread misinformation about the brave @AlexisBortell and malign her family's decision to utilize whole-plant cannabis medicine to treat her seizures after CBD-only oil didn't work. #CannabisCommunity
9344 2018-02-28 02:18:17 Western elites label anyone who stands in way of their oil & land grabs as a tyrant/dictator. Typical #BS ppl finally see thru.

"I can't believe it's not butter.  It's vegan & it's organic."

Pffft.

I *can* believe it's not butter, because it's vegan. and crude oil is 100% organic...but it doesn't mean I'm gonna eat that crap.
9350 2018-02-28 02:17:50 key to have a well groomed beard is combing and applying oil everyday. Keep that shit fresh and shiny

I had some 3DS model textures I needed up scaling (but WX2 is still ofc) that the oil paint just doesn't cut it
9401 2018-02-28 02:09:46 That is complete BS. The main reason for killing whales once crude oil was substituted for whale oil lamps was for meat & bone meal. They were still being slaughtered at far above their reproductive capacity into the late 1970s when we stopped them. Now they have/are recovering.

9450 2018-02-28 02:03:42 The Congress should refuse to certify the electoral vote from Illinois and California. Let’s see them win the White House without those 75 electoral votes right there. Their congressional delegations should also not be seated. #refusetocertify
9451 2018-02-28 02:03:31 Newer trucks are using 15w30 instead of 15w40. They say this "thinner" oil will improve fuel mileage. Meanwhile newer trucks have a after-treatment fuel injector that sprays extra fuel at the DOC/DPF to deal with particulate matter. Thus, using more fuel means cleaner air!

9477 2018-02-28 02:00:18 Seems timely to press on this issue to help preserve gas tax that actually fixes roads versus “mystery premium” lining pockets of big oil. Or are legislators content to not tangle with oil interests?
9478 2018-02-28 02:00:10 俺もoil moneyとやらで旅行をしてみてえ
9479 2018-02-28 02:00:03 it smells like... oil? like it smells super greasy and i feel gross
9480 2018-02-28 02:00:00 The top seven oil consumers combined use more than half of the world’s total. The United States alone uses more than a quarter.
9481 2018-02-28 01:59:48 Unfortunately, you can’t force @Amazon to use @FedEx to ship your stuff.

9483 2018-02-28 01:59:42 I love the way coconut oil smells. I wanna rub it all over my body.

9485 2018-02-28 01:59:25 Make sure you consume real olive oil. It’s a rather scandalous industry.
9486 2018-02-28 01:59:07 I just started 2 sell CBD oil online. I enjoy helpin people who want the medical benefits without the high & I  taking the product 2. I have not made enough 2 quit my full time yet but workin on that by building my team. DM me 4 more info.
9487 2018-02-28 01:58:51 Amazon is the modern Standard Oil and yet hipsters still protest Wal-Mart.
9488 2018-02-28 01:58:43 Glad I'm not the only one burning the midnight oil... well done!
9489 2018-02-28 01:58:42 Great...can we get our oil back? For over 40 yrs we've been told it's running out,while UK Gov have taken billions and yet Scotland has food banks. #pissoff
9490 2018-02-28 01:58:28 I make a special mix of salt and use olive oil instead of butter yum
9491 2018-02-28 01:58:25 @Ameryl_oil 안녕하세요~ 트친소에 흔적주셔서 왔어요 흔적 실수가 아니시라면 팔로우 드려도 괜찮을까요?? 팔로우 후에 메인트 링크도 한번 읽어주시면 감사하겠습니다~!
9492 2018-02-28 01:58:23 Oh! The thumbs! Although I had a shoulder sore enough to incapacitate me a couple of months back - I'd take that again over my left thumb! Arthritis in the fingers - no, thanks!

Hope the shoulder is better by now. Do you have a rice bag? Or Blue-Emu oil?
9493 2018-02-28 01:58:19 A historic pact awarding a consortium of Indian oil companies a 10% stake, This is the 1st Indian Investment in upstream oil sector of UAE, transforming the traditional buyer-seller relationship to a long-term investor relationship. Yes, AbuDhabi is a gr8 partner for India.
9494 2018-02-28 01:58:13 Why every country that has oil got a terrorist group??
9495 2018-02-28 01:58:10 Mideast oil barrens and family maybe?
9496 2018-02-28 01:57:50 my skin isn’t sensitive tho, n it doesn’t just look like dry, irritated skin. I put some coconut oil on it tho. so we’ll see.

9498 2018-02-28 01:57:27 @realDonaldTrump You don't need to help with climate change efforts.  Many of the changes off fossil fuel have begun around the globe.  It's beginning from the ground up.  Renewable energy has already surpassed oil. $$$$$.  Shame you don't want in.
Snooze you loose.
9499 2018-02-28 01:57:10 @AlikoDangote 

Where should I send my resume.  I recently read your interview with a leading malayalam newspaper  and would like to work with your firm in Oil and gas sector.
9500 2018-02-28 01:56:58 Africa barely have any notorious animals left. Common animals. Animals that will soon be extinct. Africa benefits nothing from its oil or diamonds. It never has. Majority of its citizens still have to walk 4-6hrs a day for clean water which is still technically dirty.
9501 2018-02-28 01:56:50 Last time I hada pizza hut. The pizza was dripping in oil. Yuck
9502 2018-02-28 01:56:09 This beautiful vinyl chip system comes with a 10 year warranty! Oil, salt, heavy impact, and hot tires are no match for the Rhino Lining FastFloor System professionally installed by Titan Garages.
9503 2018-02-28 01:56:03 Global Update
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank remains on course for more interest rate hikes
Emphasized that the job market remains robust, consumer spending is solid and wage growth is accelerating
Popular bond yield was 2.9%
Crude oil at $67
EU markets closed flat

9505 2018-02-28 01:55:25 I’m so excited to try my wild hair growth oil
9506 2018-02-28 01:55:22 as a "hater of unaffordable student debt," you sure love pimping a speculative asset backed by nothing that will lead to serial bankruptcy. Good job Sheila. Hope you're making lots of money by monetizing the public trust you've earned in this snake oil crypto industry.
9507 2018-02-28 01:54:39 If you've ever purchased something from a third-party seller on Amazon then you've most likely given money directly to an NRA member.
9508 2018-02-28 01:54:07 i was due for a oil change on november 9th and i’m just now getting it done .... Ha Ha Ha
9509 2018-02-28 01:53:45 Just think for a second,  Nigeria is not allowed to sell oil to South Africa,  so Nigeria wud rather sell its oil to the USA AND THEY refine it and sell back to Nigeria and South Africa.... Guys we are still slaves and colonized
9510 2018-02-28 01:53:30 We shot this gun and it didn’t work. We need to make some changes to our armaments! We will win this war! Go Oil!
9511 2018-02-28 01:52:52 Yes! We like to follow up with 100% Argan oil which is not only an amazing treatment for delicate eye skin, but also a great makeup remover.

9515 2018-02-28 01:51:41 Now I see they deleted a constituent's question about school funding from his FB post about "snake oil salesmen." Most of the remaining comments are a single commenter's barely intelligible praise of the #NotSoGolden senator.
9516 2018-02-28 01:51:08 What is the green liquid? Is it "dill oil"?
9517 2018-02-28 01:50:34 Mal ahí cuando te queda el olor a Gas oil en la mano y no se te va..
9518 2018-02-28 01:50:32 Gotta call people out on this every time. Hall was the best and often only good thing about the oil until 97 and even then Hall made that collar bone break bearable. Hall gave all he had despite management incompetence and media derision. We could be so lucky to have another Hall
9519 2018-02-28 01:50:31 Wealth goal: being able to just say “go head & fix it” when the mechanic comes in telling me all the hell going on in my car after coming in for just an oil change.
9520 2018-02-28 01:50:06 @un @AmericaTV @realDonaldTrump.  you are sucking blood of children for oil. #SaveSyria #SaveSyrianChildren
9521 2018-02-28 01:50:03 It is used by either inhaling the oil or absorbing it through the skin, usually mixed with a carrier oil. It’s believed that the oil transmits messages to the limbic system of the brain, which is known to influence the nervous system.
9522 2018-02-28 01:49:47 Your #2018Budget is going to take a massive hit the way Canada is getting wrecked on oil sales. Time to switch the narrative to a shitty economy.
9523 2018-02-28 01:49:45 Our scholars are corrupt, our leaders were placed by the zionist. America is conquering us by dividing us. Al saud loves their oil more than their faith. We are all aware of it! We are a humiliation to our ancestors!we tried to start a revolution. But it is dividing us even more!
9524 2018-02-28 01:49:39 Sexist.  Omg she is beautiful.  Haha
9525 2018-02-28 01:49:35 “Bring a case and I’ll throw in a free oil change”
9526 2018-02-28 01:49:26 オイルはギトギトというイメージを拭い去ろうか。時にはサラサラし、時にはギトギト。オイルはいつだって君のそばにいるのさ。
9527 2018-02-28 01:49:23 I think pure cbd has some efficacy but it isn’t a miracle by any means. Doesn’t mean there isn’t something else in the plant that might be even better. Not nearly enough research to recommend the other components or administration somehow other than oil right now.
9528 2018-02-28 01:49:20 Russian oil! @FBI
9529 2018-02-28 01:49:18 I've been told to try CBD oil. I can't afford it atm but if you have recommendations on the best ones that would be cool. Id like pain relief with less side effects.
9530 2018-02-28 01:49:13 blood for oil even if it's our soil we still got more white kids to spoil
9531 2018-02-28 01:49:00 Exactly! Make no mistake, the Saudis know they have a finite amount of oil and virtually no other industry. They needed to make a play towards nuclear power and they may have paid for play to do so. Remember that was Trump’s first trip outside of the U.S.
9532 2018-02-28 01:48:37  oil
9533 2018-02-28 01:48:35 In cartoons, Popeye ate spinach and loved olive oil.   It is a much a recipe as a love story.
9534 2018-02-28 01:48:33 Damn!!!! There goes that oil change 
9535 2018-02-28 01:48:24 "why do my lips feel puffy and sore and hot?" 

Flashback to me 4 hours ago putting AVOCADO OIL on my lips like the FUCKING DUMBASS I am.

9541 2018-02-28 01:47:38 Boiling oil, isn't that what you Brits do? Hah, that cop dealt him a fucking think about it next time.
9542 2018-02-28 01:47:32 am cooking oil down
9543 2018-02-28 01:47:04 Exfoliate 2-3 times a week, use a toner with tea tree oil, and doing a dance to the good skin gods have been working for me lately!
9544 2018-02-28 01:47:02 Yes! Made some sweet potato fries tonight with a little olive oil spray and they tasted great. Crispy. Made garlic parmesan wings that were crispy and juicy.
9545 2018-02-28 01:46:50 My body drenched in coconut oil and freshly shaved is the best way to fall asleep

9547 2018-02-28 01:46:46 Once we switched to oil we did not need whale oil except for the fine lubrication oil used in spacecraft etc. The reason they kept killing them was for meat, bone meal, and lubricants which could not be made with crude oil.
9548 2018-02-28 01:46:37 Snake oil? Looks more like barbeque sauce.
9549 2018-02-28 01:46:34 Love new car smell make sure u work a couple free oil changes into the deal
9550 2018-02-28 01:46:25 Watch the national debt soar. Canada is getting hosed on oil prices but that’s the trade off I guess. Pretty soon people will be complaining about the shitty economy.
9551 2018-02-28 01:46:18 Oh right, The one i use just has some sunflower oil added to help it cook in the pouch but seems to taste alright. Saves putting on the stove to boil another thing in my case.
9552 2018-02-28 01:46:02 It's the only way to be sure.
9553 2018-02-28 01:46:00 I really need to go get an oil change 
9554 2018-02-28 01:45:50 @DavidWolfe Fraud. Snake oil peddler. Lying sack of shit. Does pretending you’re helping people but knowing you’re putting them in real danger give you an erection? Moron

9560 2018-02-28 01:44:42 Coconut oil really is good for everything
9561 2018-02-28 01:44:17 Yes. Years of buying slices from Ray's taught me that. Run to the curb to let the oil drip off, lol!  The best days ever. 1971-1988. Soho.
9562 2018-02-28 01:43:51 omg so pretty! thx, i will. i just got a new oracle deck and I LOVE IT but i got a small stain of essential oil on one of the cards yesterday and i'm so upset about it lol
9563 2018-02-28 01:43:49 soo I just typed five in a half pages to find out my computer is gonna shut down in the process. I hate college, I’m going to work in the oil fields for the rest of my life.

9565 2018-02-28 01:43:26 HOW TO PAY FOR THE WALL.  Here is part of a Forbes story dealing with Mexico’s income.              Last year, Mexican remittances were $24.8 billion, while oil exports were $18.7 billion. With remittances growing and oil revenues decreasing, the pattern is likely to continue.

9570 2018-02-28 01:42:04 I don’t think it’s a dark age - but I think our naive presumptions about tech being a net-positive are gone. and there’s a recognition that there’s potentially something much more insidious to our minds/culture about big technology than there was about, say, big oil.
9571 2018-02-28 01:42:00 Every one of those jokers are corrupt hacks, like Trump.  The only difference is that the special interest that owns and controls Trump is Russia.  Oil and gas interests and the chemical lobby own Texas Republicans.
9572 2018-02-28 01:41:58 David Hogg wants to be a journalist, but doesn't seem to know the difference between a journalist and a pundit.  I don't think anyone considers Alex Jones a journalist.  From what I've seen, he just reads news and sells snake oil.
9573 2018-02-28 01:41:50 There are quite a few things ailing this club, and many of them have threads to management &/or coaching. I can't find my way clear to being satisfied with either
9574 2018-02-28 01:41:33 maybe an iron maiden? Or some boiling in hot oil a la Henry VIII?
9575 2018-02-28 01:41:27 I used to use coconut oil religiously. Like the real stuff from the health food store. Idk if it helped with growth but definitely shine and softness
9576 2018-02-28 01:41:25 Your tire rotation schedule should be the same as when you get your oil changed, to prevent uneven tire wear! Call or come by get your rotation done free when you buy. 4 or just one tire, we will rotate your tires FREE!! #rotation #free
9577 2018-02-28 01:40:53 You have to be 18 to even buy CBD oil, it's legal and way better than weed! Some want the help not the high.
9578 2018-02-28 01:40:45 @TuckerCarlson Richard Goodstein at best is snake oil who can't get smirk off his face.

9607 2018-02-28 01:34:32 Jay telling me the recent oil downturn was a once in a lifetime event. I think he thought I was just some hedge fund jerk that would do a rotation in energy. He didn’t stop to find out that I have thought about the price of oil every since 1984
9608 2018-02-28 01:33:50 Attention all patrons, please start boycotting the Dunkin’ Donuts next to us. Those friggin dotheads called the police on us for dumping our discarded food and used frying oil in their dumpster. Big deal.
9609 2018-02-28 01:33:31 It's baby oil a lot of the time. It also helps with the wrestlers talking to each other without the cameras noticing.

9625 2018-02-28 01:30:57 Norway produces far more oil than the UK and its less than half the price to extract, also the UK treasury only gets tax on any profits the oil companies make.

9632 2018-02-28 01:30:13 I think the REAL definition of insanity is me watching cooking shows on  when I can't even boil water. Sure, as soon as Martha Stewart's show is over; I'm just going to whip up one of those whole-wheat crust, mushroom tarts topped with olive oil.

9642 2018-02-28 01:29:00 Is only possible though through the use of oil heavily for both production and distribution of this produce. Again, going local, is arguably the best option, when both meat/produce are farmed/harvested organically and sustainably.

1st, if your mom leaves the car on all night, the battery will die and you should organize a ride pronto, and
2nd, if you happen to start an oil fire in the oven, throw salt on it, a lesson learned after my mom set our oven on fire.

9695 2018-02-28 01:21:49 Nothing better than some glove oil and repeatedly using it. Can’t break in a glove properly if your hand isn’t inside it.

9727 2018-02-28 01:18:53 To be a true vegan, the heavy dependence on oil from everything to production & distribution is staggering (considering the wide variety of produce required to maintain such a lifestyle). I’d argue eating locally raised/caught/hunted meat, locally grown produce is arguably better
9728 2018-02-28 01:18:48 The worlds plan is to make up as much dirt they can on the government so they have a reason to make government  change and let the evil rebels win ,This way they earn more money on weapons and they can lay down the pipelines to transfer Oil 
9729 2018-02-28 01:18:18 A person doesn't have to believe that snake oil actually works to be a snake oil salesmen
9730 2018-02-28 01:18:07 I've been having a good time with cooking pita pockets on a frying pan with no oil, and adding spinach, sheese and mushroom either in more pitas or in a tortilla sounds really, really good.
9731 2018-02-28 01:18:04 easy to be brave behind a keyboard in your nice cozy home. Doubt you'd be as brave in the middle of a war where civilians are being attacked with chemicals and bombs - children, women, men being murdered by a bunch of fanatical despots who only care about the oil.

9769 2018-02-28 01:12:18 Coconut oil is your best friend! 100% virgin coconut oil is completely safe for cats on their skin and to eat. Give him a wee bit coconut oil on your finger a few times a day and watch the difference in your cats overall health. Coconut oil helps my cats asthma. xxxx
9770 2018-02-28 01:12:02 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
9771 2018-02-28 01:11:47 Canada, I have answers. Onion skins are used for colouring. Easter is coming up; affix tiny leafs (i.e. shamrock) onto the egg shell with i.e. a rubber band, boil the egg hard, remove the rubber band (or other fixture) and then oil polish the shell until shiny.
9772 2018-02-28 01:11:38 Another one I like is apple cider vinegar to like equalish parts oil (to taste rly I don't like it overly vinegary) and then like a little bit of this mustard that has the mustard seeds in it and some pepper
9773 2018-02-28 01:11:31 Have the accountants look into the fossil fuel interests too. Look for names like Gasprom and other oil and gas names.  My name is Jacalyn Wolf Heinl and I live in Beaver Falls, PA.  Number is readily available on the web.  This is bigger than you realize.
9774 2018-02-28 01:11:04 Here's to ending our reliance on oil and coal.

9796 2018-02-28 01:07:31 But as you note, the industry as a whole is relatively low relative to others (dwarfed by Pharma, Insurance, Oil & Gas), but still $70 million last year. Which, again, might be all they need if the primary goal is maintaining/increasing the military spending pie.

9810 2018-02-28 01:05:10 Sounds bananas, but we’ve had luck with Vick’s rubbed on the feet (or garlic oil). No, I don’t know why it works & didn’t make it up myself.

9812 2018-02-28 01:04:59 Patience is better than rashness. Now with the Kirkuk oil flow agreement, there's going to be funding, US and Israel wil train and arm them, and the Kurds wil be a free independant entity. The Turks had a hundred years to make peace with its minorities. They failed miserably.
9813 2018-02-28 01:04:54 Get clear nail polish that has vitamin oil in it to help strengthen your nails! and take B12 vitamins if you can. I took them from last Jan-July and my nails are still really thick and grow so fast.
9814 2018-02-28 01:04:51 @eastcoastwings Just had the most terrible service at your establishment located in Greensboro, NC. The food was disgusting and when I asked for my food to be remade they put more sauce on it and gave it back and the oil was old and it left a nasty aftertaste.
9815 2018-02-28 01:04:50 our GDP has dropped and the TSX is now only second to Venezeula as worst performing stock exchange   So where are all the revenues coming from since LPC has sent investor billions south on oil and mining!  Where is the money coming from to pay for it?
9816 2018-02-28 01:04:42 I can probably get it done cheaper some places but I still love changing my own oil , plus brakes , spark plugs ect. All the minor stuff.

9828 2018-02-28 01:02:49 I'm doing an oil treatment on my hair so I'm in my robe with a plastic bag tied around my head and of course my RA comes around to do inspections at that moment
9829 2018-02-28 01:02:47 They're building solar plants too. They know that not only is their oil valuable as a fuel, but as a feedstock for plastic.  People forget about plastic. It's easier to replace oil as a fuel than as a base for plastic on a short term basis.

9835 2018-02-28 01:01:46 Estimated to be up to 20 billion barrels of oil equivalent left that are known of. While we transition away from fossil fuel vehicles, there are many ways in which hydrocarbons can and will be required - eg automotive parts for EVs and other consumer goods, bitumen for roads etc.

9839 2018-02-28 01:01:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, or the crime.

9874 2018-02-28 00:55:55 Well put. They privatised oil companies too.

9875 2018-02-28 00:55:07 Russia sits on massive natural gas and oil reserves, its energy independent.

9884 2018-02-28 00:53:35 We'd have ~95% of the oil fields. The actual crude oil and gas production levels vary according to the annual yield of each field, but yeah, you can currently count on 90% of all crude and 60% of all gas coming from Scottish fields.

9897 2018-02-28 00:51:20 @iancollinsuk @LBC Healthy fats are avocado oil or in  fresh avocados themselves, Extra Virgin Olive oil or Raw organic Coconut oil.
9898 2018-02-28 00:51:19 LOL! "peak kook".  Is that anything like peak oil?

9903 2018-02-28 00:50:46 ON GOD. Just hold a Cleopatra oil for me please.
9904 2018-02-28 00:50:42 Looks like he sells chicken. Or snake oil. Bet he vapes.  (So petty but so funny)

9906 2018-02-28 00:50:21 Would love to hook @pewdiepie  with our beard oil ....
9907 2018-02-28 00:50:17 Am I right in that if Indy took place, we would have the rightful claim to around 96% of the UKs oil reserves?
9908 2018-02-28 00:50:13 I’ll get my oil changed, fluids checked, might rotate my tires every 3 years....

I ain’t THAT bad.

9910 2018-02-28 00:49:31 Ive been roasting pecans in coconut oil and cinnamon. This is my dessert every day. Amazing!
9911 2018-02-28 00:49:24 amethyst + lavender oil
9912 2018-02-28 00:49:22 there is no OIL in my HOME, there is no HEAT in my HOUSE
9913 2018-02-28 00:49:20 You are fine with expenses up on healthcare and gov't despite population decline. PREPA needs to get off oil and needs access to capital.  Gov of pr needs to pay its own bills instead of acting like bank.

9915 2018-02-28 00:49:11 You are so low rent, that this is something you are leaning into. You lead tainted snake oil sales man and performance artist.
9916 2018-02-28 00:49:10 It could be, some people like taking things separately. Like myself I take a multivitamin but I also have vitamin d3, magnesium, acidophilus separately. And then I take fish oil and cla, protein, bcaas etc. 15 supps sounds about right.
9917 2018-02-28 00:49:07 จะไม่มาคนเดียวละจ่ะ ฆ่ากูที
9918 2018-02-28 00:49:02 Made my own pasta sauce with a couple cans of San Marzano tomatoes, olive oil, fresh oregano & basil, onions, garlic, pepper, and salt. Super easy, and muy tasty, although certified SM ain't cheap.
9919 2018-02-28 00:48:37 My stomach may be tired a little. For a while, I want to be careful not to ingest animal oil.
I decided to take a diet drink when my breakfast. However, this is not a diet for beauty, it is a diet to regain health.. :-)

9920 2018-02-28 00:48:37 It’s so soft and pretty. I have naturally curly hair but ofc it doesn’t behave like that. You ever try a hair oil? Helps the frizz.
9921 2018-02-28 00:48:29 shrimp sautéed in fresh lime juice & coconut oil, over avacado & cold whole grain pasta topped with toasted coconut & a homemade honey lime dressing
9922 2018-02-28 00:48:28 Query that there is any regulation of oil & gas in Texasssss.
9923 2018-02-28 00:48:26 Essentially, Thatcher blew the easy oil money on deindustrialisation and throwing workers onto unemployment benefit (which later all but disappeared) in the name of transition to a service economy.

That - more than anything - is how Scotland got screwed.
9924 2018-02-28 00:48:24 O Lord I Praise thee, you Anoint me with the Oil of Gladness and restore unto me Riches in Hope and Glory.
9925 2018-02-28 00:48:14 Why every time you take your car to the shop for one problem the mechanic telling you a million other problems that’s wrong with your car. Look man I just came for an oil change.

9929 2018-02-28 00:47:20 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
9930 2018-02-28 00:47:15 Ok so who is it the sells the body oil/lotion that makes your skin all nice and sparkly cause it's getting warmer outside and this summer I'm tryna GLO ya feel me?

9934 2018-02-28 00:46:56 He is funded by the oil companies. Renewable Fuels will always have to be ready to respond to his constituents
9935 2018-02-28 00:46:48 I wish I could capture in a tweet how amazing my room smells rn this oil diffuser really did change my whole damn life
9936 2018-02-28 00:46:41 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
9937 2018-02-28 00:46:37 9%%, why so low! i suppose u can always make oil . can they grow plants with more thc at home ?
9938 2018-02-28 00:46:18 witch hazel burned my skin and tea tree oil dried it out so now my skin is a mess
9939 2018-02-28 00:46:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, yet you and your family.
9940 2018-02-28 00:46:08 It tastes like nothing but has a really high smoke point 

It's better than vegetable oil imo, but can't beat really good olive oil at lower heat
9941 2018-02-28 00:45:49 Almond oil has done wonders to my skin
9942 2018-02-28 00:45:48 Jungkook ah, you sing very well!!!! But u should not stay too late and please sleep early!!!! Otherwise, u wake up so early?! Must take care of yourself, please  don’t always burn the midnight oil

9944 2018-02-28 00:44:44 Yeah growth is definitely the right word for it u using oil on this one ?
9945 2018-02-28 00:44:35 Stainless steel #nameplates are extremely durable, and they can withstand the harsh environments common in the oil and gas industry.
9946 2018-02-28 00:44:26 Wat will destroy South Africa is the sabotage that I'm telling you, We know UN is against Africa. Even today Iraq is not stable because USA purpose was to steal oil and destabilize Iraq, and that worked. Poverty & Corruption in Africa is created by the greed 4 African resources
9947 2018-02-28 00:44:22 Those are your words...this is about the #KinderMorgan expansion and the proposed increase in oil tanker traffic and risk here...in addition to the risks you're describing. #EnoughIsEnough #ActOnClimate #cdnpoli #bcpoli #StopKM #WaterIsLife
9948 2018-02-28 00:44:21 Went in for a $80 oil change today, walking out with a $2K bill. #gimmebeer

9950 2018-02-28 00:44:14 Needs that oil change ASAP
9951 2018-02-28 00:44:11 Are they fried in a crappy oil?  Too much fat perhaps?
9952 2018-02-28 00:43:38 She needs to invest in some blotting paper for that oil slick she's got going on there
9953 2018-02-28 00:43:34 tell me why my dog just came flying through the whole house soaked in motor oil  great day at the Gloyd house everyone 
9954 2018-02-28 00:43:30 Oh Shea butter , a little of a olive oil and kantu cream
9955 2018-02-28 00:43:27 Time for an oil change... oooh, lordy! ＼(＾O＾)／

9960 2018-02-28 00:42:28 It’s been dying for about seven years. Maybe I should crack it open and blow the dust out. Perhaps replace the fan. New bearings and all that. Change the oil. Rotate the tires.
9961 2018-02-28 00:42:19 Oh yeah, those 7 years of curbstomps in the name of securing oil. Good going there. You sure are exactly the kind of stereotypical American soldier one tend to spot online. Out of everyone I've ever talked to who claimed to be a soldier, only - ONE - was a decent person.

Sod off
9962 2018-02-28 00:42:15 A straight pin and baby oil or cornstarch. And patience...

9968 2018-02-28 00:41:03 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.
9969 2018-02-28 00:41:02 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

9984 2018-02-28 00:39:41 Tried my home-made facial scrub for the first time tonight. 300g epsom salts, 108g avocado oil, 18 drops lavender oil.
My face certainly feels smooth! Maybe a bit tight in my skin, but I don't think dry.
9985 2018-02-28 00:39:14 Yea idk it’s definitely messier. Crust is always better tho. Maybe something todo with the cheese’s oil merging with the crust.

9988 2018-02-28 00:38:42 i love brushing my hair for 80 years and putting conditioner on top of conditioner on top of oil on it so it doesnt break
9989 2018-02-28 00:38:28 I’ll never forget the disrespectful time my aunt got me a mr heros sandwich with no oil.. who would even think of something like that I mean the grease makes the whole sandwich what’s wrong with her
9990 2018-02-28 00:38:22 There is a lot of gov’t involvement with your Norway example (which I think would be a great idea) and I don’t think you are a big gov’t kinda person.  Our oil industry is totally free market so do you think the corporations here would do this?
9991 2018-02-28 00:38:10 Basically a semi-solid mass of bananas, sugar, and coconut oil. Kinda has a bread pudding texture. Drop a couple slices in a non-stick pan (no additional oil/butter) and fry a couple minutes each side. Almost works.
9992 2018-02-28 00:37:51 For soup, cook ground onion in oil, then simmer with tofu, green curry paste, beef broth and asparagus. Top with sour cream.

9996 2018-02-28 00:37:26 The manner in which the president's own people are trying to sell him European snake oil on #IranDeal fixes does not bode well for bold but necessary US action.
9997 2018-02-28 00:37:22 I've looked and looked. Can't find that right anywhere in Constitution. Help me out.
9998 2018-02-28 00:37:21 Smoke screen.......dont buy the snake oil
9999 2018-02-28 00:37:20 Every Human and Animal has a right to clean air and clean water, Oil and Coal companies destroying our world to profit. They should be outlawed, renewable energy is the future.
10000 2018-02-28 00:36:49 everyone i know has said "Yeah taxing mega corporations that could fund a small country should probably get fucking taxed more" but then again that might be because i live in a town thats been fucked by the oil industry to the point where small tremors happen cause of drilling.

10002 2018-02-28 00:36:30 I'm no genius but I submit that if you ban plastic straws and cutlery, the flipside is poor countries getting more acreage stripped to grow bamboo. It's amazing how many straws you can make with one drop of oil. Plastics are fantastic. People just need to know how to discard them

10007 2018-02-28 00:35:48 One time @dallasrowee woke me up in the middle of the night to tell me he had a nightmare, I asked what happened and he literally told me his “nightmare” was that he ate in n out burger and died bc they used peanut oil
