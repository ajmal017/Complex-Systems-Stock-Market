1 2018-02-18 23:59:46 From my understanding most UK businesses have thought ahead and hold large amounts of various crypto currency. We as always will survive and flourish, we are British and proud. The UK is strong it always will be. We have the Scottish Unicorns watching our collective backs.

5 2018-02-18 23:58:56 I skimmed over a few of your insane tweets which must come out of left field and make zero sense. You simply keep trying to run a circular argument with zero actual facts except for discredited Snopes.  Go play with Crypto Idiot, as you two seem alike  Bye Felicia
6 2018-02-18 23:58:37 There’s no problem wiping the AP, because it’s just something that has value only in SOLA. But SOL is a crypto currency, which means that is will be taxed. How can the users explain to their tax office? “I was goxed”?

13 2018-02-18 23:57:43 I know. Bags are full, just waiting now.
14 2018-02-18 23:57:41 I agree, but do you really believe governments will allow Bitcoin (or other crypto) to be part of the future economic landscape ? If you look at China or India for example who do not allow it because it destroys their control on the money supply.

What are your thoughts on this?

25 2018-02-17 23:59:07 乖離率10%超でロングしてSFD取られても、利食いのタイミングでも10%超えてたらSfd返してもらえるから、定常的に乖離10%超える状態に入ると、この仕組みあんまり意味をなさない。。
