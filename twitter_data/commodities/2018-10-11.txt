3 2018-10-11 23:42:38 That’s not entirely untrue. The dairy market is over supplied which keeps prices ridiculously low and margins unsustainably thin. I couldn’t fathom doing anything other than mixed veg in a niche. Commodities, Dairy, and Cattle pay a pittance.
4 2018-10-11 23:38:48 Damn how do u follow all charts & news on crypto, forex, commodities etc at the same time ?
5 2018-10-11 23:33:28 It’s math. Rise over run. Unlike other commodities the more profits miners make the less they sell. And once miners reach that efficiency of 7-5 nm it’s going to take time before new 3 nm chips come out. What you see is a replcement cycle. Antminers getting replaced
6 2018-10-11 23:26:02 Bit odd that commodities ccys are rallying when this type of sentiment...
7 2018-10-11 23:09:55 They’re proud people & hardly EVER ask for help but the past 3 years crops have been going down the toilet. The commodities are way too high & they are losing their farms over it. They only need the help they get for a little bit. They don’t live off it like some do forever!!
8 2018-10-11 22:56:30 25yrs trading on commodities exchange & they never put me on with you? WHY?
9 2018-10-11 22:53:11 Ask a vet how government run health insurance is. Let the market provide commodities. The government should only take care of common goods.
10 2018-10-11 22:51:30 EYI~ FEMA Director Brock Long: nearly 3,000 people in field ready to assist w/ Hurricane Michael.  Teams/ aircraft ready to support any search/rescue missions in FL or elsewhere, staging areas w/ commodities needed after storms set up in Atlanta & Maxwell AFB in Alabama.
11 2018-10-11 22:47:48 June 2014 to December 2014, (6 months) the price of oil dropped 56%.

April 2014 to September 2014 (5 months) the price per ton of corn in the US dropped 27%.

December 2015 to July 2016 (7 months) the price of gold rose 24%.

Market based commodities prices fluctuate, so?

13 2018-10-11 22:39:48 Sad...was in Zimbabwe in 2003 for a year those were never scarce commodities
14 2018-10-11 22:34:25 That’s why you just gots to buy commodities and ride the wildest of roller coasters. Jk. FINRA seriously just kidding...
15 2018-10-11 22:26:51 Brasil y Argentina se mandaron tremenda fiesta populista la última década. Para cuando terminó la música y caen los commodities, Brasil y Argentina quedan con un déficit fiscal de 7% del PBI.  Lo sostienen c/deuda hasta llegar a 80% del PBI. Chile sin resaca, ni déficit ni deuda.

17 2018-10-11 22:21:00 If we elect a new and good president, will the current high prices of all commodities go back to their old prices??. .
18 2018-10-11 22:16:23 Los países deben exportar lo que genere mayor valor agregado. Eso puede ser desde commodities hasta productos high tech. Pensar que solo la industrialización agrega valor es pensar la economía con ojos de los 50’
19 2018-10-11 22:03:57 Nick Gartside, capo della divisione reddito fisso e commodities di JpMorgan:
"La variabile chiave sarà la crescita economica e crediamo che le misure messe in atto dal governo italiano possano essere di stimolo per l'economia."
