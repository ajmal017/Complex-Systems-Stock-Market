2 2018-07-10 23:59:39 Do other tech folks get LinkedIn requests to advise dodgy crypto currency startups, or am I just lucky like that? 
3 2018-07-10 23:59:08 When I do new crypto (or even implement known crypto) there is absolutely NO way I ship it to the world for production use without dozens of people checking my work. Because every time I’ve tried I screw something up. Every single time. It’s that hard. 2/2

(全国の上司ども〜聞こえてますか〜？
定時で帰るのはありえないとか、悪とかって風潮や雰囲気漂わすのやめてもらえますか〜？
あなたが決める権利ないですよね〜？
こっちは仕事が全てじゃないんですよ〜？
「定時で帰る＝悪」じゃなくて「定時で帰る＝普通のこと」ですからね〜？)

14 2018-07-10 23:57:28 The hallmark sign of a scam on Telegram is when a new user joins a channel and immediately, with their very first post asks to speak to an admin about something business related.   Spoof accounts of known crypto folks do show up often in these spamming attempts.
