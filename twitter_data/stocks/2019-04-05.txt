0 2019-04-06 23:58:52 Yesterday they had stocks upto 700+ queue. As long as they have the same stock count. Should still make it
1 2019-04-06 23:57:50 What is the proof qe4 saves stocks? global  QE + NIRP has the entire world sinking right now including US. There may be to much debt and inequality for QE 4 to matter. Prove to me what QE 4 does or is it all speculation from the past that has very diff circumstances in 2019.
2 2019-04-06 23:56:42 They also used the #TrumpTaxScam to buyback stocks.  Rich get richer off working class back. Income inequality has never been worse.
3 2019-04-06 23:55:24 A few months ago I joined Motley Fool for a year and bought a few of their recommended stocks (in my Etrade account, not as DRIPs).
4 2019-04-06 23:54:36 Bud stocks have tanked. Dilly Dilly.
5 2019-04-06 23:54:13 Yes, but the increase in world wide liquidity (debt) needs to accompany this chart. Are these actual or comparative figures over a pervious period?
This chart must suggest highly index weighted stocks have increased and pushed up the S&P index.
6 2019-04-06 23:53:32 They would need to act fast, put all the money is stocks or gold, this way the assets value rises with inflation.

14 2019-04-06 23:43:13 Bought a few China stocks for a few hundred and made $7000 in one day dude. Defunk corps are closing. 750,000+ manufacturing jobs added since Trump in office and that’s just manufacturing! Women unemployment down to 3.3%! Lowest since 1953! 5bill people off food stamps #walkaway
15 2019-04-06 23:41:42 When people are not worried about where thier next check is going to come from, they are more willing to invest in small businesses and stocks. The income from these would be taxed. Not to mention UBI does not preclude working.
16 2019-04-06 23:38:43 I recommend every trader read these 5 books:
1. Reminiscences of a Stock Operator- lafevre 
2. How to Trade in Stocks -livermore 
3. How to Money in Bull and Bear Markets- Weinstein 
4. How I made 2 million in the Stock Market- Darvas 
5. How to Make Money in Stocks- O'neil

21 2019-04-07 23:56:00 Unpopular opinion: Quantitative easing is just as good for bitcoin as it is for stocks.

23 2019-04-07 23:54:06 Might do what I've never done before and listen to music during sets at majors. Every single time, I don't think about the game at all until I'm down 2 stocks or down 2-0, then suddenly I'm like "Oh fuck I'm about to lose." Need music to make me actually try while playing.
24 2019-04-07 23:52:07 We ain’t going back broke! Long as these stocks & mutual funds keep growing. 
25 2019-04-07 23:51:55 $gvt working product... transparent traders across different markets. Stocks coming soon. Putting traders on a blockchain for confidence and transparency....finance sector. I see it huge in 5 yrs...
26 2019-04-07 23:50:32 Need to get you into penny stocks
27 2019-04-07 23:46:40 Hi @deadset59, unfortunately, there is currently no way to cycle through charts for stocks on your watchlist. That said, it's a great suggestion and I'll be happy to log it for review. If you have any other questions or concerns, please DM us. Many thanks. ^Nick
28 2019-04-07 23:46:11 I never gamble on people or animals - they are vulnerable & subject to abusive practices that are (at least in horse racing) associated with venality & gambling. Also too many variables. I hate to lose. Instead, I bet on stocks. They are more predictable. 
29 2019-04-07 23:43:08 I'm just astounded we're having this conversation. It's free in Ontario. I encourage all my students to pick up a kit. Naloxone won't stop this overdose problem but this Band-Aid will save lives. Insurance companies should be buying up stocks and giving it to you to dispense!
30 2019-04-07 23:42:20 For instance, you have those they dislike me because I won’t follow their crappy methods, take their crappy advice and listen to their “best stocks to pick” advice 

Which when all combined don’t even reach 1%
31 2019-04-07 23:39:45 Thank God @WWERollins won, we needed a real weekly Champion & not every 2/3 month, maybe. I was about to sale my Wwe stocks, really.
Congratulations Seth..

35 2019-04-07 23:35:52 Christy,Eric here insults beta males,most metrosexual beta males know they are despised by real men; reviled by modern feminists who created them and are laughing stocks.Eric feels he is important&people care about him;we want to stop his anti-freedom/anti-Constitutional ideas
36 2019-04-05 23:58:17 Sorry yea, it was the “ home and voice memos” apps that came with Mojave along with “stocks and news” 
TV app confirmed for this year.
37 2019-04-05 23:57:32 3/Instead you support the policies of the NRA and other pro gun lobbies that allow people with mental disorders to order AR-15s and bump stocks online. Absurd. The NRA looooooves the uneducated.
38 2019-04-05 23:53:17 A question though.  If you are a parent, one who is already struggling under the current system to provide enough food for your family, would you choose to take that money that use to go to Social Security and put it into stocks, or would you try to feed your family?
39 2019-04-05 23:51:44 I get universal health care/ I paid 1600$ for one year of university I got 5 weeks of for parental leave the mother got 1 year off/ 7$ a day day care, I invest in stocks I work for one of the most profitable companies in NA
40 2019-04-05 23:50:27 Sold some US based U stocks during last 2 days for 2 reasons: 1) US based U SP went up much more than the rest in the last 2 wks. To keep portfolio balanced, need to sell us based to buy non-us based U stocks. 2) 232 looks more like sell the news event now as speculators pile in.
41 2019-04-05 23:48:25 I would recommend others to buy DFFN stock their at 3.70 a stock right note I think this stock will pay off in the next few years. I have 9 and will be buying more. @DiffusionPharma #invest #stocks #futurewealth
42 2019-04-05 23:47:07 We all make mistakes - that’s why you keep a portfolio of stocks. There are always a few big wins/big losses - but most just march along. Some do better than others and in different time periods. Some take longer to reach the finish line.  Ctl I’m collecting the div while I wait.
43 2019-04-05 23:46:30 Pro tip: Don’t be a “day trader”

FX, Crypto, penny stocks etc

I’m telling you right now - you won’t make much $$ that way. Just wasting your time.

Go BUILD something.
44 2019-04-05 23:46:15 I was up over 120% in 2.5 months; but didn't sell. Now up less than 100% but I'm in this for the long term - if I keep selling every time it shoots up, won't be able to catch the big move. Good stocks can grow 10-20-30X over several years. Just how I see it anyway.
45 2019-04-05 23:45:09 They built the company together. There are stocks, properties and assets in both of their names. They divorced because of his infidelity. He knew the risk involved, especially since WA state legislature says that assets acquired during a prenup-less marriage are split 50/50.
46 2019-04-05 23:44:11 New rule: You can only chart pot stocks using 7 hour candles because they are 420 minutes.

47 2019-04-05 23:43:54 This suggests major recession coming in late 2020-2021 That's why some big wigs converting stocks to gold? Trump's policies are big fail Time to buy BTC Save assets Buy hard assets Curtail spending Delay buying home Sell quickly homes before devalue Diversify assets? #economy
48 2019-04-05 23:43:33 apple stocks rise by 35%.
49 2019-04-05 23:42:45 Trying something new to do sector analysis for the day based on stocks in my database. I include 3 "special" sectors of China, Cannabis, and 5G, since those seem to be kind of "hot". So stocks in those sectors also are part of other traditional ones.
(Part 1 of 4...)
50 2019-04-05 23:41:59 Commons stocks and Uncommon Profits my friend! 

Buy right; sit tight.....until the business/management deteriorates; all in that book :)
51 2019-04-05 23:41:55 Don’t be mad bro! I know stocks are hard to understand for white supremacist  like you
52 2019-04-05 23:41:52 #Bitcoin has been the best preforming asset over the the last 3 and 5 year periods, better than real estate, better than stocks. Hardly a lottery ticket at this point.
53 2019-04-05 23:41:44 To sell or not to sell my Netflix stocks, that is the question...
