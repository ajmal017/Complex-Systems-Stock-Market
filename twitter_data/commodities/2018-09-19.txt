43 2018-09-19 21:45:02 But defense spending is not our biggest problem. For one reason, it's a legitimate public good. Many current and proposed welfare programs are commodities that balloon in cost the more people it covers. Second, it's a fairly small portion of the entire budget.

52 2018-09-19 21:16:36 I just wish someone could explain the market forces that drive these dramatic value swings. It seems not just unpredictable but also irrational. Values don’t seem to have any correlation to stocks, currencies or commodities. So irrationality & no regulation seems a bit scary.

69 2018-09-19 19:30:53 Just to say this again, policymakers and experts simply discussed postwar economic governance in much broader terms, and very much included commodities, trade, etc. in the same sentence as currencies etc. So indeed, there was some sorting out and dividing up of things still do to

73 2018-09-19 19:08:22 Thank you. Exactly. Women are sick of being treated without basic dignity. First, the country elects a president who brags about sexual assault and now this.

116 2018-09-19 16:35:48 Pl forget Sidhu he is not so important sky rocketing prices of fuel  & other essentials commodities are the main area of concern to discuss & question from govt what steps our government is taking to control price hike
117 2018-09-19 16:33:21 We are goods. We can be bought. Depreciating commodities.... All because of ilobola.
118 2018-09-19 16:30:43 And yet dairy farmers in New Jersey are suggesting a supply management system is appropriate for their industry. 
The problem with “free market” in food commodities is the supply demand cycle results in waste/scarcity and farmers unable to make a living. 
As shown by US subsidy
119 2018-09-19 16:08:53 Vegetable, pulses and commodities pricing is muted in money wholesale markets. One of the slowest September ever. Just before a big festival season. 

It's going to be a bad OND quarter
120 2018-09-19 16:05:50 Fare se lekar essential commodities ke rate badh Gaye hain. Sir ji pls galat chez Ko support na Karen. Main bhi 14-15 tak aap jaisa soncha Tha par performance nahin dene ke baat I & many of my non-political friend don't support.
121 2018-09-19 16:03:51 And on that same note - Money coming out of yen also into stocks. So it’s general rotation out of safety of bonds and yen and into risk assets stocks and commodities. That’s how I see it
122 2018-09-19 15:59:06 Recebeu não. Recebeu um país com moeda estabilizada (coisa que não existia), deu sorte com o boom das commodities, mas preferiu o projeto criminoso de poder do partido que assaltou o país ao invés de estruturá-lo. Grandes obras? Quais? Da Odebrecht? Sei....
123 2018-09-19 15:56:06 Well said Mr Gutu but now tell us how the government is doing to address this crisis and how is the opposition contributing to the rise of all the basic commodities and who controls the economy of Zimbabwe
124 2018-09-19 15:47:35 I understand but we’re well past going off “upside”. We need to put proven commodities in the rotation. Sheff is young rookie so he’s different. Lynn also, I’d be weary to sign.

126 2018-09-19 15:39:15 Children as commodities. This is sickening.
127 2018-09-19 15:38:05 No they are not. In a cycle it's inflationary recovery state, where interest rates are raising and DXY is weakening and EEM, commodities are creating boom for inflation. Once this recovery break to slow-down phase it's game over. And it seems Jan2018 started slow-down phase.
128 2018-09-19 15:36:50 Más allá de la coyuntura, lo que dice este gráfico es que nuestra economía no debe depender de un commodities cuyo precio se fija muy lejos nuestro y según intereses que no controlamos. Cada vez más necesario un plan de Industrialización y exportaciones con valor agregado
129 2018-09-19 15:36:08 For someone bullish on EVs the safer approach might be to invest in the commodities (eg cobalt producers)
130 2018-09-19 15:25:13 Marco I swear I was just about to ask you about what U think about everyone saying that BTC wouldn’t go below these levels because of production cost ... has this happened in the history of BTC? Or just most commodities as you’ve stated that you know of ?
131 2018-09-19 15:22:59 It might take longer to harvest w/out desiccating, but isn't it moot when there is a glut of unsold/unwanted grain? Unless it is contracted commodities, the variables are a crap shoot, quality and investment-wise. How many food processors had no idea what the residue levels were?
132 2018-09-19 15:22:58 But at least you trade commodities and forex so you will be fine when it kicks in and recognize that fact
133 2018-09-19 15:17:52 If it is China selling then the money is going into the Chinese markets and commodities. Look at charts, FXI bottomed around the same time bonds topped out.

135 2018-09-19 15:15:05 Nobody said anything about them being commodities. I personally would never leave my pets behind but sometimes it isn’t that easy for people. That’s all I’m saying.
136 2018-09-19 15:12:54 What's wrong with Kenyans? Always loving foreign commodities including sex? South C
137 2018-09-19 15:08:51 Healthcare, UI, education, those are all commodities. Just because you claim them as a right doesn’t just make them appear. These cost trillions and someone has to make/provide them.
138 2018-09-19 15:06:06 bonds are attempting to making multi-year lows this week..... a lot of selling. That money needs a home. Stocks and commodities seem like the obvious choice imo $TLT $SPY $CRB

140 2018-09-19 14:58:28 in the way things are headed/already taken place, “influencers” are the next ad space

it’d be naive to ignore this sign of the times
141 2018-09-19 14:56:37 As certified DG shippers our team here at Hawkeye certainly has more exposure to what haz mat is, but we only ship a few commodities and are still surprised by what is haz mat!  Fun video (in a great city!).  Thanks for doing "asbestos" you can.  (SB)
142 2018-09-19 14:55:00 I'm voting for Republicans that support the President's agenda.

146 2018-09-19 14:36:18 Having said that, inflation has also gone up due to GBP weakening against the USD (thanks to Trump) - which is the base currency for oil and other commodities used as raw materials in manufacturing. So it’s not all QE.
147 2018-09-19 14:32:52 There is a resistance being redefined. Change is coming.

China's tariff authority announced on 18 September that China will levy an extra tariff on U.S. commodities worth about USD60 billion. Based on Foreign Trade Law and Regulations on Import and Export Duties of P.R.C and approved...

238 2018-09-19 09:31:11 Bus fare will be increased by 4% (which was  previously increased before 2 or 3 months)

Increase in prices of many commodities indirectly. 

Increase of LPG price

Still the party lovers will justify this.

243 2018-09-19 09:09:01 Agreed. However in the long run from a personal point of we I would argue we focus on self sufficiency in commodities and move towards service driven industries. Theoretically we could out perform Singapore. We need internet speeds to also increase

268 2018-09-19 07:11:35 I would say the govt could've gone one step further & barred ownership of similar other luxury commodities without a registered tax #. 100% agree tho that tax collection & net increase should b the ultimate goal but registration of tax IDs I feel is an important step towards it
269 2018-09-19 07:05:55 By taxing the basic commodities, most families will be hardly hit by these recent measures by government. Changing taxation measures every FY hurts many industries as one cannot forecast adequately ie EABL will continue to suffer due to uncertainties.

279 2018-09-19 06:30:58 If prices of imported commodities rise and govts subsidise the end user by giving subsidies to OMCs, the Taxpayers have to foot the bill for such luxuries. Rise in price
leads to fall in demand and consequent fall in Fx outgo. Nation gains.

288 2018-09-19 05:43:14 Current thesis is that most of commodities will go much lower from current levels, there might be USD squeeze above 105 and higher, after that we might be looking at generational commodities bull market
289 2018-09-19 05:40:17 Who said consumption would come down with rampant increase of prices. These are essential commodities and irrespective of being wrongly hiked, people DONT HAVE A CHOICE but to unfortunately purchase it...

On a positive note the house should look great and I’ll have a new semi and commodities trailer ready for the road here shortly haha.
346 2018-09-19 02:04:36 Unlimited greed and madness, it is mostly the low & middle income folks who have or are losing their shirt, to earn big money quickly stupid people bet all their savings do not hesitate to borrow money to bet on highly risky speculative financial instruments stocks & commodities
347 2018-09-19 02:01:44 Sweet. Don will be happy to hear that. Apparently this spread sheet and travel plan was organized. When you are going in and out of so many countries, that really made sense.
348 2018-09-19 01:59:32 I don't agree. specifically education promotes the general welfare of our great nation, it also promotes our defense & insures domestic tranquility within our populace. education is not a luxury, nor is electric, water & gas. they are all commodities that are bought & sold.

351 2018-09-19 01:53:32 Broadly speaking, yes.
Inflation is poorly defined, depends on 'consumer basket' (???). fluctuating price of commodities, and the IRs available. Ex: a speculative hike in oil price will 'inflate' prices of all energy intensive products.

EL PUEBLO NO QUIERE BICAMERALIDAD¿NOS OBLIGARAN?
354 2018-09-19 01:48:15 Uma coisa é ter as provas para incriminar especificamente LILS, mas já tem pessoas do petê na cadeia.

Ninguém em sã consciência pode acreditar que o PT, PMDB, PP e outros não aproveitaram o milagre das commodities e surrupiaram a valer os cofres públicos.

356 2018-09-19 01:07:09 A nation running an enormous trade deficit that has to import vast quantities of commodities priced in USD can’t play fast and loose with its currency. Learning that last time around was very painful for most people, and certainly for public services.

360 2018-09-19 00:59:58 The rest of it is, in fact, fucked up power dynamics that are inherent to a patriarchal system wherein women are treated as commodities, prizes, or trash with regards to sex. It's super gross! I'm not saying it isn't! But consent is still the priority.

362 2018-09-19 00:56:59 That system always works. At worst, you have a plethora of talent at one position and you trade some assets for what you need... Proven commodities.

367 2018-09-19 00:20:27 That was fortuitous for y'all, no doubt. I don't hate him, and I didn't watch Week 2 (only saw Gamecast play-by-play) so I'm a bit in the dark. But it looked shaky at times, and I want to see more before I'd put him above more proven commodities.

371 2018-09-19 00:01:14 Trade shots did not trigger a risk-off mode but acted as a catalyst to positive investor sentiment. Risk assets i.e. equities found support in a robust manner. Shanghai stock market bounced as much as 1.8% from its lowest level since 2015; US stocks & commodities delivered gains.
