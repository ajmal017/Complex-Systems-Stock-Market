80 2019-05-18 22:36:02 Not having major feedback on this chat, but I think all alt coins are reflecting historic moves done before (penny stocks, pump/dumps), so now that we for sure know this, it's time they die a natural death they always meant to end up as. Only one, for the protocol of blockchain.

And Quantitative easing is coming home to roost. Believe that. Inflation is coming hard. Why own stocks in high interest rate environment?

138 2019-05-18 21:23:43 This is a win for the quiet Australians. Those that don't go abusing farmers or protest in the middle of Flinders streets. Australians who worked hard and built this country. Stocks go back to asx this Monday and I'm sure everyone will too. #ASX will go up Monday.

141 2019-05-18 21:20:48 The difference between crypto and stocks and why crypto is far superior to stocks is that you can buy fraction crypto. If I want to spend 500 dollars hypothetically I can either get an even number with stocks and leave a remainder of money just sitting or buy 500 worth of crypto.

144 2019-05-18 21:17:43 His pay is exponentially correlating with the results of his performance. He fails? No pay. He succeeds? Gets pay. Sure the numbers are unusual, but many CEO’s are paid in stocks as well. Elon only gets those shares if he performs well.
145 2019-05-18 21:17:25 @APompliano How can Oleary be so well off and not see the opportunity cost of missing the next great transfer of wealth. Railroads. Oil. Gold. Bonds. Stocks. Mutual funds. EtF s. None of that garbage interests me. It's all yesterdays crap. Take your wealth wherever you go.Bitcoin
146 2019-05-18 21:15:59 Bought most at around 300 and some at 250. The threat of full-blown trade war is making stocks volatile but we don’t have control over that. Tesla raised cash to protect against this so they are in better position. In 3 years i think this will all be just noise so I am holding.

156 2019-05-18 21:04:42 You should pick/support your team just like investors invest their fortunes in the particular company. Investors SELL their stocks if the company is doing bad  and BUY stocks if the company is doing great. They don't really support particular company, they look 4 consistency.
157 2019-05-18 21:02:05 Thank you for this info. I’ve been waiting for someone to update. May I ask if there’s still a lot of stocks by this time?

164 2019-05-18 20:57:49 I made pasta with tomato and tofu as a replacement for usual protein. It's still pretty yummy. I'm a little hard pressed finding mock meats around here in my city. Apparently a lot of people are investing in those company stocks though so it'll probably get here eventually.

176 2019-05-18 20:42:21 Unless you’re an engineer, these are facts. I see it first hand.  they get their moolah in stocks though if they sign on prior to IPO.
177 2019-05-18 20:40:29 Idk, depends on the industry. In other places fisherman have been movers for enforcing restrictions when stocks get low. Problems would incur when it couldn’t be enforced on outside groups coming in.

192 2019-05-18 20:27:17 I've always marveled at the fact that so many Trump supporters praise Trump when the stock market goes up... as if they have any stocks or shares in anything when they don't even have teeth.
193 2019-05-18 20:27:01 Are those the dates of his sales or the dates of the reports of the sales? Because if those are sale dates, he sold the bottom instead of dumping on shareholders like normal exit scam --I mean-- stocks.
194 2019-05-18 20:25:39 Why would they!
I’m willing to bet that every GOP member has large stock holdings of Pharmaceuticals, especially Trump.
Investigate the entire GOP.
The fact that they’re eager for War, they likely own stocks in the Military Industrial Complex.
GOP Party is completely Corrupt.

205 2019-05-18 20:15:05 I get what you mean, it's kinda a bit of both actually. Yeezy as a company has stocks and the owners have shares. And its also a fashion brand, with shoes and clothing, as their brand franchise. But under Adidas, which is the income we're discussing, it is a fashion brand.

219 2019-05-18 19:59:21 The Fed is not legally able to buy stocks, but in a world where they monetize the US debt, and interest rates are at the lower bound or negative, the people will demand that they do, bc the pension funds based on the Ponzi scheme will have gone belly up

226 2019-05-18 19:53:33 And do you really think the UK on its own would be able to stand up to such lobbying?
EU has already banned some neonicotinoids.
Fish stocks are recovering because of the EU quota system, this needed European wide action. I've not seen figures on how much was dumped.

273 2019-05-18 19:10:07 But why do that. I just cant see the benefit. Folk will.lose jobs in manufacturing. Pensions and stocks will likely drop. We will have weaker security. For what?
We'll have to agree to differ. Thanks for debating constructively tho

277 2019-05-18 19:04:50 There is more than one way to become wealthy - starting a business, investing in rental properties, investing in stocks, working in a high income profession for years, etc. - but there is a common trend among all people who become wealthy: they spend less than they earn.
278 2019-05-18 19:03:44 I’m really interested in investing into stocks, crypto currency, etc. 

If anybody has experience/knowledge, tips, anything...PLEASE LET ME KNOW

314 2019-05-18 18:23:49 How 2003 and 2019 are same...??
Valuations alone makes a big difference...
In 2003 everything was at dirt cheap price... And in 2019 everything is at higher valuations with few exceptional stocks...
315 2019-05-18 18:23:33 Thanks. I will check tat
316 2019-05-18 18:23:24 I love the beetroot wraps, our local @BoothsCountry stocks them 
317 2019-05-18 18:20:54 Yes it's very much possible & I don't deny that fact. What we need to understand is the context in which a stock is making 52W high or low. Many stocks are marked up only to exchange hands with retail & to trap them. That's why I pay a lot of attention to volume. It really helps.
318 2019-05-18 18:20:51 This is intuitive. Everyone wants a bargain. But "bargain" is relative. One man's bargain is another's premium. To be market specific, buying cheap stocks isn't the only way to play the markets. E.g $BRK has underperformed the S&P over the last decade and so has value to growth

404 2019-05-18 16:51:43 Can feel your pain. I’m sitting on two disastrous stocks, $BPMX and $CAPR. I’ll try to take it as lesson to learn, the hard way. Good luck to you for the next trades and thx for your honest insights.
405 2019-05-18 16:49:34 I also see some out of stocks which is part of growth and a healthy thing.  Now if we can only get the @Starbucks inside to have the #brainoctane and grass fed butter add on's my shopping experience would be instantly #upgraded #trends #sales #outsidethebox
406 2019-05-18 16:45:24 Cette mue parisienne tranche avec le "tout bagnole" des années 70.

Ce n'est pas un jugement, les stocks de pétrole regorgeaient à cette époque-la et les Français qui avaient vécu sous le joug de l'occupant voyaient dans la voiture la liberté retrouvée.
407 2019-05-18 16:45:08 Soon stocks as well indices would fly high. Earning shall fall in place once but at that time stocks would be expensive.

410 2019-05-18 16:42:20 If we are confident that it doesn't matter whoever forms the govt stocks will discount fundamentals after some time, then we can wish coalition govt to catch the knee-jerk market drawdown.
Besides, coalition govts in India were better than one party majority govt in recent times.
411 2019-05-18 16:41:33 Ruger 10/22. You can buy many different tactical stocks.
412 2019-05-18 16:40:47 How many stocks you track per day? do you prefer top gainers and losers list or you have standard stocks list to trade them on daily basis.
413 2019-05-18 16:38:06 market doesn't seem to care if your stocks are "great"... $NVTA, $TNDM , or your IPO $TIGR ...what I'm doing and loving is trailing half stop at hourly 9EMA / ~3% and half stop at daily 9ema ~7%...and sell some above upper Bollinger on 15 / 60 / day timeframes (into rip)
414 2019-05-18 16:35:50 Regarding the stock, i’m sure it’s been taken down for big banks and institutions to accumulate. I witnessed it done to many other stocks
415 2019-05-18 16:35:18 Golden words! 
For 1st point, reason is HOPE
For 2nd point, reason is FEAR

Perpetual HOPE is the reasons why accounts blow up repeatedly. Markets, stocks don't believe and run on HOPE at all..that is where the technical analysis play most vital role giving us stop loss levels 
416 2019-05-18 16:35:16 Can always tell who doesn’t know much about stocks as if “isn’t going anywhere” is meaningful, predictive, or even positive.
417 2019-05-18 16:35:09 I have been trading only few stocks so I dnt need to run for 200 stocks 

Following few stocks makes u familair with stocks move over year and levels are by heart 

All depends on set up occurring for eg an intraday trade can become a positional trade and vice versa
418 2019-05-18 16:35:08 Economics of Elections

1. If Modi wins,buy mutual funds,shares

2. If Congress wins,buy land & take agriculture loans

3. If 3rd front wins, sell everything, accumulate gold and wait for elections within 1 year

4. If there are chances of 2 elections in 2 years,buy liquor stocks

420 2019-05-18 16:34:34 Kapag makaabot dito yung stocks nila  sana talaga
421 2019-05-18 16:34:26 psa, if you ever run into a significant amount of money do not go buy a chain. pay off some debt, buy some stocks, build your wealth. come on y’all we gotta do better for ourselves
422 2019-05-18 16:34:22 Well vine is dead, YouTube is dying, and stocks wouldn’t be a large payout. Well at least not as large as it could have been.
423 2019-05-18 16:33:40 Cant remember where I read this but it elegantly explains private vs public market tension wrt startup valuations : 

Former has only optimists, latter has optimists, pessimists & skeptics. 

I use this framework to explain the gap to those who don't follow tech or stocks.
424 2019-05-18 16:33:14 I decided to let my money work for me so I buy stocks, don’t we smoke weed all day and we buy it, how much profit you gain none so why not invest that money dumb people won’t get it
425 2019-05-18 16:31:29 ...and there should be a cap on how much the CEOs of private health insurance companies can earn. Mark Bertolini, CEO of Aetna, received compensation in 2017 of nearly $59 million, much of it in stocks and options he exercised during the year. Obscene.
426 2019-05-18 16:31:21 Shit! I’m not positioned for an explosive move higher in stocks.
427 2019-05-18 16:31:15 If I’d go back into I’d tell my dumb ass to start a YouTube channel, vine account, and invest in stocks.
428 2019-05-18 16:31:03 There’s many ways of trading/investing aim stocks .. one method buy then have enough funds to average down 3 times every time it goes a penny or 2 down  .. (dyor)
429 2019-05-18 16:30:52 There is no way Danny would have posted it in good conscience if he knew it was a mixed race baby .
I find it much easier to believe his explanation, than to believe someone of his intellect, would put himself in the stocks like that .
Knowing what the consequences would be .

444 2019-05-18 16:22:52 well, for the more stable stocks/cryptos, but honestly dude, cryptos might be semi-calm now, but they still are rather volatile. do you just do btc? hopefully you bought yours before the rise in q1/q2?
445 2019-05-18 16:20:52 The market is always oscillating....usually between getting shares out of your hands on some timeframe, and then running the stocks you sold upward...other option is wholesale correction...what phase are we in now?
446 2019-05-18 16:20:31 I still have some stocks left 
447 2019-05-18 16:20:17 I hear that foreign investors who have confidence in Pak stocks and longterm outlook were buying whilst local investers took money out after scaremongering by the PMLN & PPP media nexus.
448 2019-05-18 16:19:54 Why do stocks move randomly on most days without any news or change in fundamental nature or status of business?
449 2019-05-18 16:19:48 Sandra Rolnicki: uses natural language processing to pick bank stocks, outperform banking index. Bad news often followed w/positive spin, so look at high emotional valence (EV). Low, high EV portfolios over-, under-perform SPX by 1%, -3.3%.  @RinFinance #rfinance

459 2019-05-18 16:15:05 In countries like the US, Canada, Germany and Japan today, yes. Banks will honor the deposits (e.g. in US they are FDIC insured upto 200K).  

But most people diversify and don't store more than 5% to 10% in banks; rest is in real estate, stocks, bonds, etc. depending on country
460 2019-05-18 16:14:56 In the marijuana industry? Pick one. The problem is a lot of people getting paid to promote these stocks, and dumb money managers who buy the hipe with your money.

470 2019-05-18 16:06:08 Yes Chipo, I know it sounds terrible but it has never been cheaper to buy Zim stocks. Plus if you're confident of a political solution or that status-quo is unsustainable then you must believe an upward trajectory is possible from the bottom we've hit. It's like buying in 2008.

472 2019-05-18 16:03:54 Yes - that seems to get around that criticism that the short side of BAB doesn't survive transaction costs because of high turnover.

I'm looking at trend too: 14% of small/mid/large stocks currently pass an ensemble screen for strong uptrends (13% for downtrends).
473 2019-05-18 16:03:49 Would you believe it if I told you the stock declined because the time was right for it to decline? Stocks have cycles, same as the universe. Other than BYD who is creating as many electric vehicles as Tesla? It’s easy to be criticize, not easy to do. Rivian started around Tesla.

475 2019-05-18 16:02:45 Maybe stocks because they’re heavy on news but there’s structure and rules the market makers need to follow and they use psychology to induce you to take the wrong direction.For the most part they do the same shit everyday there’s daily,weekly and monthly cycles they have to fill

$wsj and others in my view printed many outright lies about the trade deal YTD that never got substantiated but juiced the markets when they came. Clown show @realDonaldTrump might certainly do this for stocks.
481 2019-05-18 15:55:13 Time has already told on that move. I'm much better off. Instead of losing money holding TSLA I made >100% on some solar stocks. 

But for the future, yes, time will tell from here as well.
482 2019-05-18 15:52:20 @itvjeremykyle represented the embodiment of much of what is wrong with the UK. The encouragement to emotional knee jerk judgement, the cruel public stocks, the unexamined stereotyping, all help explain how Brexit became a reality. The dumbing down of a nation.

502 2019-05-18 15:35:19 The 37% tax on these students' funds should be eliminated immediately. Only 50% of Americans can afford to own stocks. If they make money on a stock they hold for over a year, the tax rate is 15%. If they lose money, the value of the entire holding is a tax write-off.
503 2019-05-18 15:34:45 First time your data is some what accurate not all but 50%. Second thing there is term called Beta stocks if you dont know go n check. Except Kajaria and Dollar others are High Beta Stocks. TATA Motors: 1.67, PCJ: 1.1, Kwality: 2.06, Kajaria: .61, Eveready: 1.3. So shut d fuck up

513 2019-05-18 15:27:25 Totally agree. And he is using his stupid voters for making millions of dollars at everybody's expenses: he uses his position to make announcements or even moves (i.e. China) to make the stocks drop down severely and a couple of days after, he announces the opposite, so stocks up
514 2019-05-18 15:26:18 I am lucky and my company actually gives both a 401k and a pention. A 401k is a set percentage that the employee or company sets at the beginning and lot of time is tied to stocks. A define pension is based on this is what the company gives based on the times spent there.

519 2019-05-18 15:21:52 The wealthiest 10% own 84% of the stocks, and the richest 1% own 50% ,so you can see why its troubling to continue to use the stock market as an indicator for a thriving economy when most of the people benefitting are already financially sound ,and far removed from the rest of us

Indices chase momentum.

As index investing grows > more funds  flows into index funds > Index funds have to invest the sums in the same stocks> More money flows into the index fund.> Repeat indefinately.

How does this self feeding cycle break.

571 2019-05-18 14:43:05 There is a silver lining. Magic is growing tremendously and many paper collections are appreciating as fast or faster than financial investments like stocks & real estate.

The deflection of American tech stocks is not fair.

642 2019-05-18 13:47:35 Your problem is you’re using the Apple stocks app so you’re at the mercy of algorithms and which outlets are paying to place their content there. Yahoo Finance is just as bad. By all means keep tabs on prices, but those apps are no good for news. Need other sources for that

650 2019-05-18 13:41:46 This!

When they destroy the prior cycle's leaders in the bear, those stocks take the next bull market off.  Sometimes they take the next 2 bull markets off.

Any wonder why things like Energy and Banks have lagged so badly post-2009?
651 2019-05-18 13:39:41 the fact that you'd buy private healthcare stocks now shows you have absolutely no idea what you're doing

708 2019-05-18 12:38:34 Foreign investors are investing in Pakistan stocks whilst Pakistanis are selling shares. Looks like the Mafia are reacting against Govt decisions re accountibility.  PPP-PMLN scaremongering & disinfo may be working on locals but it is not deterring foreign investors.

710 2019-05-18 12:37:49 2/ For 10 years running Ws has invented new narratives to explain or justify why everything is diff this time and stocks can rise under every scenario or crisis So let me say to @barronsonline , @cnbc @WSJ stop with the garbage
711 2019-05-18 12:37:18 Yes every one said that... Have 8-10 stocks with diversification but not understand why only 8-10?? A mutual fund generally made portfolio of 20 -25 shares.  Are they did wrong. Actually my concern is also that all companies in a sector are not good. And perform differently.
712 2019-05-18 12:36:29 $OTLK climbed even higher Friday (37% more) after its big move Thursday. Next sub-$1.00 biotech to do this could be vaccine stock $VXRT, it’s due after the big pop in $NVAX too.  #stocks #biotechstocks #vaccines

714 2019-05-18 12:31:57 Consumer confidence very high. The demand is still there. Gasoline inventories are dropping and below average. Everyone has been paranoid demand will drop and so far it has not. With interest rates down, stocks, housing prices and commodities in general will all rise.

717 2019-05-18 12:31:12 How are those defense stocks doing?
718 2019-05-18 12:31:11 Why over diversification is not good for your portfolio?
-Low expected Returns
-Tracking them all is difficult
-Duplication or inefficient diversification(like buying same sector stocks:BPCL/HPCL)
Max you should have 8-12 stocks not 30+!

745 2019-05-18 11:56:07 That's cause there are so many intangibles in investing, even the best investors can have self doubts when prices continuously fall.

810 2019-05-18 10:57:49 You clearly have no idea of basic economics. The value of pensions is driven by the share prices of the stocks they hold. A re-nationalisation programme that undervalues the shares held will drive the value of those shares down and pop goes the value of people’s pensions.

It doesn't matter what price you pay for this stock; when it goes to $0, you'll still lose 100% of your money!
1. Auto stocks trade at book value. 
2. Tesla's book value is $25. 
3. That's ~ 90% downside, even without bankruptcy.

829 2019-05-18 10:28:23 This is the reality of the economy. There is no point for govt to come and intervene as they are doing. Stock are also declining because mutual funds are investing in t bill which is offering decent return . Hence selling stocks
830 2019-05-18 10:27:35 My guess would be there has been a lot of money poured into stocks of companies that would create the force. Now they want to make their millions.
831 2019-05-18 10:25:52 That's amazing. I had no idea you actually did announcing. Marc, I have read your book GRWD twice. I have implemented the strategies and am still building my portfolio. Everything you taught in your book seems to work. I only worry about my non dividend stocks!

I wasn't involved in Apple back then but have shorted plenty stocks to zero, esp during the 2007-09 crisis. Tesla is a more obvious short than any of them ever were. See u at zero.

Nirav got all his LOUs under UPA.

Factually, they HAD to fled country because they no longer deemed it safe to be here.

Secondly Bankruptcy and Insolvency code of 2016 is doing wonders to banks.

920 2019-05-18 08:09:25 I expect a 8-10 percent correction and it could start next week. Spx is pulling back and trade war stalling. On top of that stocks has been rising a lot since January 1. We need a correction. #stocks #SPX

926 2019-05-18 08:05:38 Well stocks go up in price because people judge the value of one is more than market price, and so buy, driving the price up. If other people don’t buy the stocks I own, the price of those go down too.

1000 2019-05-18 06:17:16 10 yr US bond is 2.39%.  Germany & Japan negative %. Strong appetite for US bonds. Apparently no need to cut deficit now. Deficit spending stimulative, economy stays strong.  Increase in homeless & low wage jobs a social failure, poop in streets but rest get richer, stocks go up.
1001 2019-05-18 06:16:18 Thanks - very helpful - amazing that it works. I assume that the long portfolio is positively correlated to BAB and that the short portfolio is negatively correlated?

1032 2019-05-18 05:46:20 Retail investors are very anxious and would keep on checking the performance one way or another. 
Some news are very instrumental in taking decisions as well.
 So, a better way would be to provide a no notifications button for stocks where you are ok with volatility.

If you are "risk averse" and won't want to lose your money while investing in stocks especially as MTN has brought the market to limelight again, this is how to know how risky an investment is per unit of returns promised.

1046 2019-05-18 05:28:46 Are investors aware that if they want profit from buybacks they have to sell stocks? Thats why companies buy there own shares to reward investors but if they don't sell it is onley a figure on there portfolios
1047 2019-05-18 05:28:11 But it has fallen 2,000 points in the last 10 days. 537 jump is minuscule in front of the battering that stocks got.

1049 2019-05-18 05:26:26 I plan on sticking with him as my main for doubles but for when I team with someone where my survivability is important I’d like to make taking my stocks as hard as possible (teaming with a lucario or some shit)
1050 2019-05-18 05:25:26 Effects of years of QE and asset purchases by Fed have compressed yields. Not just in stocks, but real estate as well. Historical cap rates in the 7s are trading in the 2s in Southern California. A day of reckoning will come when Fed is forced to raise rates.
1051 2019-05-18 05:24:28 How did you decide to trade small/micro cap stocks vs. say index futures?
1052 2019-05-18 05:24:01 Do you know this is a popular myth? Buy & forget?  Bufffet used to hold 30% of his stocks for less than 6 months

1057 2019-05-18 05:18:39 After looking at Robinhood most popular stocks i doubt those kind of buyers do any analysis at all. They just buy familiar brands and hot stuff like cannabis.
1058 2019-05-18 05:14:43 I buy quality stocks as wedding gifts for my near and dear ones.
1059 2019-05-18 05:12:48 a lot of red heads on that chart. But how much downside below 7.5, its tough shorting cheap stocks.
1060 2019-05-18 05:11:17 Well perhaps instead of buying back all their stocks they should have saved some money, have they never heard of, trump vodka, trump air, trump university, trump meat, and I can go on, he ran them all into the ground, did they expect different?
1061 2019-05-18 05:09:54 Somany Ceramics, Godrej Properties, Sharda Cropchem and Godfrey Phillips have lost 13-15 per cent in last one month against a 4.6 per cent drop in Sensex. These stocks had gained 30-47 per cent between January mid-April period.

1064 2019-05-18 05:08:49 Not only has the rally in these stocks halted, there are concerns if they can see a recovery anytime soon. Brokerages say a few of these stocks are not yet looking like value buys even after the sharp fall.
1065 2019-05-18 05:07:49 So true... I'm ok if I get stuck here on this Compound, but we gotta move soon... my water storage is piss poor and my food stocks ate slim... need to re-up soon as I get new home
1066 2019-05-18 05:06:40 Above deleted and reposted because apparently $ before the word profit creates a link like words after # do. When I clicked on it I found all sorts of stocks related stuff. I didn't want to leave it up like that.

1077 2019-05-18 04:51:10 (2/2) Security companies profit greatly from buying the cheaper stocks while that company's investors are ultimately the ones who lose the most from a MS warrant since they didn't buy those now cheaper stocks.

Not entirely sure if that's 100% accurate but that's my understanding

1082 2019-05-18 04:49:41 (1/2) So I'm not 100% sure how its specifics work, but the gist of a MS warrant (correct me if I'm wrong) is that a company can't borrow money from banks & investors so it raises funds by selling its stocks at a cheap price.

1103 2019-05-18 04:27:32 That's quite a sales pitch!  Are you a big fan of @DSjuggerud?  Is he widely respected?  He makes a good case for stocks, and then says he's invested elsewhere.  Did you pay to learn the secret investment he likes better?  I'm not sure whether I'd want to discover it is Bitcoin.

1111 2019-05-18 04:18:29 First step would be; get a corporation to adopt the rule, that it sells to it s own workers first, before going to a public option on Wall Street, increasing or decreasing the amount of available stocks on the market.

1114 2019-05-18 04:18:02 I might be wrong about this, but ranking stocks based on Sharpes would select stocks with the most negative excess returns divided by standard deviation. Since the latter is in the denominator, smoother downtrends are "better."
1115 2019-05-18 04:17:15 So the question is...  What is the 2019 equivalent?  So I can find a running shop locally that stocks them?

1122 2019-05-18 04:14:03 after it s proven to be a successful business model, annex or better said, adopt amendments that are going to regulate workers ownership, workers first buy stocks of the company they work for, and other rules.

1172 2019-05-18 03:07:08 Just stop spending.  That will get more attention then any tweet or protest.  Only buy essentials.  No big purchases, no money into big banks(use small community banks).  Stop all unnecessary spending.  Tell your money managers to stop buying stocks 9zif it applies).
1173 2019-05-18 03:06:53 U are not allowed to buy stocks unless u have at least 3 medium posts on S curves. This is Stanford bicc I don’t make the rules
1174 2019-05-18 03:06:26 come hither so we can lock you in the stocks and throw rotten tomatoes at you
1175 2019-05-18 03:04:54 Sir bahut ghamandi insaan ho, unfollowing you immediately.
You get followers because of your knowledge in stocks and trading. When you speak something else it's always out of context, irrelevant and   egoistic.
1176 2019-05-18 03:03:59 Finally after a couple of years I’ve learned It’s all about discipline and waiting for your set up. Just rinse and repeat. 7 stocks I look at 3 setups a day. That’s all I need.
1177 2019-05-18 03:02:35 Financial & stock market in deep spin as rupee down by 5% and stocks by over 1000 points in 2 days. Continuing devaluation seems part of IMF deal that is not made public. Bring it into the open in Parliament & assure that provinces share not being slashed, to avoid speculation.

1180 2019-05-18 03:00:02 This explains a ton! Sometimes it's right in front of me & I just can't see it. Thanks! And I'm really glad my favorite bar stocks Pilsner Urquel, which I found by getting fed up with the struggle to even finish IPAs anymore & working my way down the menu.
1181 2019-05-18 02:59:14 Very very very poor top ten list. I hope you pick stocks better than top 10 rappers. 
1182 2019-05-18 02:58:46 Stocks are like housing prices they only go up
1183 2019-05-18 02:56:18 "do your due diligence." That experiment into penny stocks and learning the terminology and markets was a very necessary move for me and setting the foundation properly right as i got in at spectrum.
1184 2019-05-18 02:55:30 Ppl need to do research. Many cannabis penny stocks out there for the long game too
1185 2019-05-18 02:53:44 "Day Trading" will always be safer than "Swing Trading" or Long-Term investing in my eyes until the Stock Market is open FOREVER and a Trailing Stop will work 24/7

1186 2019-05-18 02:53:31 It may also mean that - stocks might plunge, and your critics and customers will make you famous....
1187 2019-05-18 02:50:40 Yes you are right. Hu Xijin was referring to those stocks (mainly hardware producers) that face a "live or death" situation. I guess he was lost in translation. Only those who invested in the Chinese stock market understand what he meant.
1188 2019-05-18 02:49:50 There are few quality stocks like Hero Moto Corp Maruti Icici Bank

My God I feel sorry for them.
1191 2019-05-18 02:46:34 Yep even with this correction #btc is still up around 9% on the week. Not bad since that’s the historical average of stocks for a whole YEAR 
1192 2019-05-18 02:44:26 So, if Walmart raises prices to keep competitive, then the law of Supply & Demand shall be the purchasing of less Chinese goods, their markets dwindling,their stocks & economy goes down,while American producers get a bump up. Tariff Capitalism can work 4 US.

We agree that kids shouldn't vape, but your hypocrisy is astounding. Your financial gain from tobacco stocks is sickening.
1204 2019-05-18 02:28:39 you have to learn that there’s a company behind every #stock and there’s only one real reason why stocks go up. Companies go from doing poorly to doing well or small companies grow to large companies.

1205 2019-05-18 02:26:33 Had a crew battle yesterday against some juniors. I really underperformed. I know I could have done better. But, I only took 9 stocks. Well, better luck next time ig.
1206 2019-05-18 02:25:59 I agree that it's a matter of case selection, but Baidu is certainly not Huawei-related...a possible explanation is that state-owned financial agencies were pouring cash into these stocks. Just my personal opinion.
1207 2019-05-18 02:25:40 Yes because rising auto sales imply bumping up ratings on all ancillary stocks too!
1208 2019-05-18 02:25:00 I think you're right. That's why I wanted to see if the long/short version of Sharpe ratio momentum would work. I'm surprised that it does: so Sharpe momentum is shorting smoothly downtrending stocks while BAB is shorting volatile stocks, and both work.

1212 2019-05-18 02:19:50 I say this off-hand because I have noticed that lower vol stocks & assets tend to have higher sharpes. So, if I target sharpe in my momentum, my hunch is that the portfolio would have a lower vol profile versus a classic momentum portfolio. Again though, would need to test it.

1225 2019-05-18 02:08:57 I’ve been thinking about this stuff lately because I was losing a lot of early stocks because i kept getting edge guarded. So with some practice hopefully I can consistently get back to the stage

1228 2019-05-18 02:06:11 Although question was asked to @Deishma sir but my view is bajajfin, bajajfin, kotak are longterm pf stocks. Buy on dips. Right now at all time high. Buy near 50 day ema
1229 2019-05-18 02:05:54 Due to the rush of states to pass anti abortion laws, the value of condom producer stocks should skyrocket. The day is nigh when women will be forceful in making certain she is safe from empregnation. So chill out boys.

1238 2019-05-18 01:57:53 任健 indeed those three stocks went up. I guess that given the size of 华为 one could identify Huawei-related stocks losing value.For ex: Baidu (BIDU) today. So you could argue the other way. It's a matter of case selection. In terms of suppliers, they are very diverse.
1239 2019-05-18 01:57:18 yea.  thats the answer.....charge a father for making a mistake.  let me guess, you are a democrat that believes fear is the way to solve all the worlds problems.  do you own private prison stocks?  grow up peter pan

Not because bagholders smartened up or indices/ETF-s crashed & had to liquidate. Stocks avail for short didn’t budge, hence long liq.

1277 2019-05-18 01:16:39 I've been extremely busy at work due to understaffing, so I haven't been day trading. So instead I'm swing trading stocks that don't require constant supervision. -3% $AKBA, +10% $CPRX this week. Account isn't growing as fast as I'd like, but it's growing.
1278 2019-05-18 01:16:38 Most murders are not mass murders. Most don't even make the news.

1279 2019-05-18 01:14:48 I find it difficult to get excited about getting up and bashing stocks every day in order to buy cheaper shares. Now you're just making yourself look pathetic. How many shares did you buy on the last dip? Not enough I guess
1280 2019-05-18 01:14:15 Let’s consider another scenario. Buddy lives in Idaho but trades Canadian pot stocks. He moves his money into a Canadian bank (maybe even moves here). Does the Canadian bank have an obligation to seize those funds because any pot related activity is illegal in Idaho?
1281 2019-05-18 01:13:46 hey @timothysykes i know you specialize in penny stocks, but how do you feel about options?
1282 2019-05-18 01:11:20 Absolutely not! I ain’t indicating it’s cheap or expensive. Just saying, within the fall, a lot of stocks are now available at throwaway valuation.
1283 2019-05-18 01:11:06 If MMM does end up another 20% lower that would mean many industrials would get pulled down too since stocks in same sector trade together. Put it this way, if MMM gets down to 140 there is little chance SPX will be above 2900 when MMM is at 140

1306 2019-05-18 00:50:29 Don’t understand why there are so many negetive news about TSLA everyday. These shits only affect our investors’ faith in TSLA and influence the stocks. Nothing else! Our life and future will be better without these shits.
1307 2019-05-18 00:49:53 Centralization & command require enclosure, heavy physical capital, constantly accumulating stocks of resources, inattention to local conditions, and the type of standardized, primarily capital, production all inimical to ecology & the environment.
1308 2019-05-18 00:48:16 I’m not holding any ETH except for testing purposes. Almost all of my portfolio is traditional stocks - and even then it’s pretty small. I do hold some Stellar Lumens which I bought years ago now.
1309 2019-05-18 00:45:53 Investment strategies given on 9 May. Reliance moved up from 1254 to 1266. Bajaj Finance from 2890 to 3301. HDFC Bank from 2275 to 2361.Bajaj finance and HDFC Bank rocked.Holding 50 quantity in all stocks.. Your visions and analysis are excellent for both trading and investment.
1310 2019-05-18 00:45:50 The stock market has been very volatile under trump. It lost over 600 points in one day last week. Making a killing on stocks is never easy and much less so with a maniac in charge. Read a friggin’ newspaper once in a while.
1311 2019-05-18 00:45:04 The decision about when to buy or sell often is called THE ENTRY DECISION

1317 2019-05-18 00:39:41 Stocks trading at a $~3B market cap, buyouts run ~1 to 2% of AUM, they’d get more than 10%.... don’t like the firm as well but disagree here.
1318 2019-05-18 00:39:34 Ross, why do people think so short term with stocks it seems? Is the concept of business ownership lost on so many? If one were to open a franchise restaurant as an investment would they/could they so easily sell in and out or give up while they implement their plan and survive?

1324 2019-05-18 00:36:17 Trust me its much easier contributing to your retirement with smoother returns and 10% drawdowns than owning all stocks and experiencing gut wrenching 50–55% drawdowns where you 
most likely panic and sell at the bottom and thus miss the big bounce off the bottom.
1325 2019-05-18 00:35:44 @ClayTrader25 I want to get some dividend stocks in Coca Cola how many stocks should one buy to see a bigger dividend payout ? Is monthly dividends better than yearly ? How are they issued to you?

1341 2019-05-18 00:26:28 @garyvee Hey Gary! I’m 15, have a passion for finance. I want to start a hedge fund in life and I’m learning all I can about picking stocks and investing smartly. What advice do you have for me?
1342 2019-05-18 00:26:16 Shenseea stocks gone up
1343 2019-05-18 00:25:16 7-10mm a day volume and over 1,000 open interest on 1 strike out of the money. Is that too light of volume for you to pull the trigger? I’m not sure if anybody has run into a similar situation where their company was matching money on stocks outside of their 401k.
1344 2019-05-18 00:24:40 
1345 2019-05-18 00:24:25 My feed is full enough of Tesla shorts so I don’t have to look hard! (Btw, I don’t short stocks)
1346 2019-05-18 00:23:40 + You have no way to protect your 401K from market corrections. In a self directed IRA you can buy protective puts, buy dividend paying stocks and compound monthly 1% to 2% gains with covered calls.
1347 2019-05-18 00:23:28 Crypto target on market cap is way beyond tradional stocks market IMO. Imagine you can move and trade freely around the world. This is where we can unite as a world citizen. Personally i ve more than 10 accounts in some exchanges.

1358 2019-05-18 00:11:06 Yet their market reforms were, again, motivated by these intrinsic problems. And they are still accumulating massive natural resource stocks, building such heavy capital projects it's causing earthquakes & constructing massive empty concrete cities.

1360 2019-05-18 00:07:32 The world currently OVER produces everything, it is a scale back of production, especially of throughput, below rates sufficient to replenish stocks, sicks & ecosystems, that is necessary, using non-extracted resources. A centrally planned economy literally *can't* do that.

1362 2019-05-18 00:06:06 The infrastructure, social, technological & physical, needed to run a centrally planned economy--let alone on a global scale--requires massive stocks of heavy capital, accumulated throughput, and enclosed natural resources.
1363 2019-05-18 00:05:45 "So WHAT?!? He's a Business Man, HUUUUuuuuugge! A BIG Businessman AND CORPORATE FARMS WILL BUY THE FAMILY FARM AND THEN CORPORATE FARM STOCKS WILL GO UP AND THEN THE FARMERS 401K's will go up & I WIN AGAIN!"
*goddamn clod kickers believe everything i say, is this mic' still hot?"
1364 2019-05-18 00:05:25 Fair point! I do remember it being Last stocks but I also remember it always ending up in a 2v1 in their favor.
1365 2019-05-18 00:05:11 That sound about right. Big Pharma is in the pockets of the Dems. That's why the cost of meds under Obamacare has shot up so much. They know Medicare and Medicaid can't negotiate lower costs for patients. How much do Dems own in stocks from these pharma businesses??

1367 2019-05-18 00:01:32 ahahahah I love it--the infrastructure of state management and planning is itself throughput intensive, and can't survive without massively accumulated stocks of raw inputs & heavy capital

1369 2019-05-18 00:00:35 Yahhh. re:TSX. Assuming one stock is of better value over another would be hate speech. Let’s stop picking on stocks with low earnings, it may hurt their feelings....give them all a passing grade! You can’t make this stuff up @BillTufts @SpencerFernando   We need a new plan!

1377 2019-05-19 23:54:53 The decision to invest in stocks or bonds or to stuff your money in a mattress or even to save money is an “active” decision. But let’s not confuse things. Are you trading to outperform a static benchmark? Yes? That’s active.

1432 2019-05-19 23:22:18 Oh he knows, he's just being intentionally dishonest.
Calling it Ripple tokens and Ripple stocks on purpose to dissuade potential XRP buyers and encourage Bitcoin buyers.
He's a real piece of work. (PoW)

1435 2019-05-19 23:17:52 Balance isn't what I'm talking about.  I'm talking about design.  You don't want to get hit.  Getting hit is what leads to losing stocks, which ends up in a loss.  You should never be rewarded for LOSING.  That's how the worse player wins which is AWFUL design.
1436 2019-05-19 23:13:35 apple stocks rise by 20%.
1437 2019-05-19 23:13:15 Equities worry me because we’re at the end of a ten year cycle fueled by cheaper ebt and buybacks. Lots of stocks selling for crazy P/E ratios.

Bumpfire stocks aren't firearms, so no laws were broken 

Even with the current law banning them less than 200 have been turned in and there's no way to enforce it

1445 2019-05-19 23:05:17 With equities you already know what you’re gonna get.

I highly doubt a year from now you’d be saying to yourself “damn Ryan you shoulda put that 30k into more stocks” lol

Or just do half in equities, half in btc.. this market sells itself.
1446 2019-05-19 23:01:54 Participated in my very first Crew Battle today against the Pit Discord. I ended up doing pretty well taking five stocks out of the thirty. I had so much fun today. Thank you @cathArcAct2 for the stream. I enjoyed watching and listening to your commentary ^~^

1450 2019-05-19 22:58:33 I’m sorry but this is just not true.  I watched election night, my stocks and economy just creeping along. THE NEXT DAY stocks BOOM . Just by winning, not even in offc yet! And then when he took offc we finally saw hope and change. Now that’s just the truth
1451 2019-05-19 22:58:13 Financials have most to gain from a LNP win, capital gains tax, negative-gearing reform, & changes to dividend imputation no longer happening. Bank stocks suffered from expected implementation of such policies. #AusVotes #Election2019Results #AustraliaDecides #auspol
1452 2019-05-19 22:55:21 No, you misread me. By the time we got a general strike we’d be too far. And who says. They’d make money off our misery, short the stocks, sell weapons apply insdurrection law and start over
1453 2019-05-19 22:54:55 That’s my point. What you’re doing in stocks is ok. We agree. I did that in my 401k. But gambling is not investing. So doubling up to catch up is a death wish.

1464 2019-05-19 22:44:30 You don't think the simple fact many nations have no regulation and/or allow material over-fishing of fish stock biomass may contribute to declining fish stocks? Suggest this is materially more factual than your climate narrative.
1465 2019-05-19 22:43:31 If you’re good at stocks I’ll pay you to do mine for me and you’ll get 40% of what I make. For example if I make 1mill, you’ll get $400k. Leaving me with $600k! Bro ima be good

1467 2019-05-19 22:41:22 I absolutely agree with @nuclearkatie on Yucca. Every country that tried to close the fuel cycle has ended up with large stocks of separated Pu. Much more dangerous than SNF.

1476 2019-05-19 22:32:41 False. People are working 2 to 3 low-wage no benefit part time jobs. Working poor are skyrocketing, the stock market doesn’t help working class- only the rich who owns stocks.

Tax breaks helped the rich
Stock market was up (down now because of tariffs) but most people don't have stocks. They barely make ends meet! 
Prices going up because of tariffs which are just taxes on Americans!
1484 2019-05-19 22:21:50 Fisheries policy and management has come a long way. Also market & quota issues impact on what is currently fished where. Eg you don't have quota for whitefish, or a good market for it, or processing facilities for it there is a challenge in fishing it even if stocks are healthy.
1485 2019-05-19 22:20:17 Sure. But choices of whether to invest, or mix of stocks and bonds, is far more impactful than the decision of what large cap US equity mutual fund to invest in,  no?

Focus on low costs is a distraction. Get the asset allocation decision right and it will overcome median costs.
1486 2019-05-19 22:19:17 It's more about constantly reading, playing detective and having experience - knowing your marked than technical analysis when trading stocks.

1491 2019-05-19 22:14:33 The decision to invest at all is an active decision. How much to have in stocks and bonds is certainly a personal choice that should be based on one's ability to take risk and need to take risk.
1492 2019-05-19 22:13:58 Seems likely. I'd much rather put them in the stocks and invite locals to show what they think!
1493 2019-05-19 22:13:47 This is the moment I want to bring back the public stocks. Maybe set them up in front of the Washington Monument, w/cutouts of Trump smiling. There could be bus tours with rotten produce to throw at this smirking face & all the others that broke the law & spied on Americans.
1494 2019-05-19 22:13:43 Asking for evidence is evil?

Trump cheats on his wife, repeatedly.  How does that set with your moral code?  He bragged about grabbing women sexuality.  Would you want your daughter near him?  

You probably love 2A- Trump banned bump stocks by executive fiat.

Buy before stocks last. On 23rd May, there will be a chance of price increase.
1506 2019-05-19 21:58:05 Long term, a fair PE to me would be something like 20. Which is pretty normal for blue chip stocks. To give $TSLA a $100B valuation, they need only to make around 1M cars /yr with an asp of $55k and GMs of 20%. Something I see happening in the next 2 years. Very conservatively 3.
1507 2019-05-19 21:57:44 SG wants to double (to 18k) the number of aquaculture jobs by 2030 and double the contribution the sector makes to £3.6b by then too. The bulk of this is fish farming. It’s factory farming on a disgusting scale, causing disease, environmental damage and loss of wild stocks.

1509 2019-05-19 21:55:27 I take stocks sometimes I won't 
1510 2019-05-19 21:53:57 What happens to stocks if it's down toward zero?  Some would say SPX could sky-rocket on multiple expansion. Experience of Europe and Japan is contra, however. And of course, earnings presumably weak if economy that bad.
1511 2019-05-19 21:50:57 Yeah I completely appreciate that and I know it happens unfortunately. But like with any form of stocks, number one rule should always be to make your own decisions and take responsibility for your own buys/sells
1512 2019-05-19 21:49:54 U can enjoy an imaginary cabinet for nxt 5 years atleast. Get yr stocks ready.
1513 2019-05-19 21:47:23 The stocks?
1514 2019-05-19 21:47:11 If that’s what the goal is he could’ve got him some stocks and bonds.
1515 2019-05-19 21:45:13 As you said, Japan has fallen from second place in GDP.
The main cause is not the real economy, but the failure of stocks and real estate investment.
By the way, will China invade Taiwan with force?
I think that international criticism is big.
1516 2019-05-19 21:44:30 Let’s invest in these stocks
1517 2019-05-19 21:42:50 Sir , are you or do you know of any Indian broking house with which we can buy and sell US stocks ?

1524 2019-05-19 21:36:44 On average, there are five waves in a trend, three impulse (w/ the trend) and two corrective (pullbacks). The first and second pullbacks in a trend are the higher probability plays. After that, the probability fades as the trend becomes obvious to the crowd. #stocks

1526 2019-05-19 21:35:27 I would same the same thing on a Thursday: Buy some kid toys and some stocks with that Rolex money.
1527 2019-05-19 21:35:23 Having achieved command of W Europe's economic output by mid-1940 made the Nazis -- Hitler particularly -- in Berlin rather overconfident in taking on Stalin in '41. 

Seeing a Wochenschau touting the seizure of the French Army's immense supply stocks in late '40 was enlightening
1528 2019-05-19 21:35:09 STOCK TIP:

Buy stocks in companies that make those blue tarps & companies that make camping tents & cardboard.

I have a funny feeling those are GROWING markets for the next 20 years or more.
1529 2019-05-19 21:34:56 Madison was talking about muskets not AR-15s and bump stocks.
1530 2019-05-19 21:34:08 It won’t be his blood getting spilled, & it won’t threaten the thing he cherishes most: His money.

As a matter of fact, I’d be unsurprised to find out that he’s recently invested heavily in defense manufacturers’ stocks. War profiteering is totally in keeping with his character.
1531 2019-05-19 21:33:32 4/  the market capitalisation of crypto-assets stands at 4% of the market capitalisation of the so-called FAANG stocks and at 1% of euro area GDP. It is also smaller in size than the peak of the two major past bubbles, the dotcom bubble and the subprime mortgage securities bubble
1532 2019-05-19 21:33:28 Nope. No, I wouldn’t. Maybe buy him some kid toys and some stocks with that money to create some generational wealth.
1533 2019-05-19 21:30:38 Flies. Hmmm. And a peasant to boot that sucks at war. You know what peasant. What kind of name is Beelzebub. A desperate love hate Lunatic that stocks others with a team that keeps disappearing. Are you too chicken to face me one on one for a fight

1556 2019-05-19 21:03:41 I’m not a  expert but my understanding is the blight is still a problem. OTOH I’ve read that several groups are trying to grow blight-resistant American s (hybridized with Chinese stocks) & have also found viruses that infect the blight to use as a treatment for infected s.

1559 2019-05-19 21:01:46 @ImranKhanPTI now no more oil and gas. Just sell all your stocks and invest in dollar to gain your wealth or get broke. 1 dollar will be 200+ in 2020. Sell all your company and buy dollar. You can get 60% return in 1 year or lost your money in huge amount down way.

1575 2019-05-19 20:49:01 Individual traders have a huge advantage over large institutions. Large institutions are limited to mediocrity due to their size and diversification. If you own 100 large cap stocks then it is hard to achieve massive gains because you are limited by averages. Concentration is key

1587 2019-05-19 20:42:13 If its for investments, buy some stocks or mutual funds, way more secure and probably more upside. Consumer tastes change, who knows if the high end watches will still be as popular in the future. I already feel like fewer people wear watches now due to smart phones

1625 2019-05-19 20:11:53 I think the two people most hated by Gun Nuts are Ronald Reagan (banned automatics) and Donald Trump (banned bump stocks). People like Obama didn't have the capital to pull off bans like that. "Only Nixon could go to China" and all that.

1646 2019-05-19 19:45:48 Here in NZ it doesn't drive a huge amount of new bad construction,  but it does lead to a downgrade of pre-existing rental stocks as landlords customise houses in bad ways to fit in more "bedrooms" and maintain them in shitty condition for years.
1647 2019-05-19 19:45:30 I think a lot of designers just tend to find stocks and duplicate them, tips on how to make this from scratch would just to be to whip out the shape tool and the pen tool and experiment with different ways ;)

1655 2019-05-19 19:42:33 @ProfLowell (2/3) For example, had you bought $1,000 worth of SGEN stocks on this date 10 years ago, you'd have $7,513.57 today. This is a return of 651.36%. Not too shabby! #Fin2209

1697 2019-05-19 19:15:15 Time to study stocks!
1698 2019-05-19 19:14:00 A financial contract is boring low level stuff. That's easy to automate. Trade realestate like stocks that sort of thing. Or transfer your house title at nearly zero cost within minutes once proper authorization. Blockchain automates trust. The US Gov't will be disrupted as well.
1699 2019-05-19 19:13:36 apple stocks rise by 35%.

2. Almost 90% of Americans taxes reduced. 
     Plus raises and bonuses and new jobs.
     Plus 55% of Americans own stocks. Made money there too.
3. Best MINORITY/WOMEN employment numbers in 50 years.

1715 2019-05-19 19:04:01 Ditto #stocks.
Hasn't that been similar bubble - soaring prices in recent years, while good-wage jobs largely vanished and keep on vanishing?
Aren't stocks pure gambling - and an obvious bubble now?
1716 2019-05-19 19:03:50 Lol. This to me looks like a clear trend with a retracement on something that looks like a 61.8% fib. 

Buying right after the pullback is a great chance at making proper profit.

Besides, currency trading and stocks trading don’t follow exact same rules per se.
1717 2019-05-19 19:03:33 You cannot beat a good rotten veg throwing at some git in the stocks.

This seems mild in comparison.
1718 2019-05-19 19:01:25 The main reason for BTC IMO it’s actually not it’s quality’s as sound money/digital gold.
It’s the opportunity cost of ‘holding other assets like usd or stocks’

Hyper inflating USD / Equities that produce nothing are dumb money, that a third party had to hold for you.
1719 2019-05-19 19:01:09 I see better talent in the mini stocks at my local dirt track

1721 2019-05-19 18:57:26 Absolutely! We R in a false economy. Stock market only went up with this administration because the rich R the benefactors under trump rule. Like most middle class, I don’t own stocks so it’s hard 2 get excited when the Dow goes up. That market will come crashing down soon
1722 2019-05-19 18:57:24 Who am I? We are not breeding stocks. We are not good people by nature. We are not gods. We cannot create out of nothing. We are sinners by nature. We are created in God's image. Race has caused us to forget who we are. Race has caused us to forget our purpose.
1723 2019-05-19 18:57:06 If u want to sell your stocks it’s now. It will peak on Monday.
1724 2019-05-19 18:56:31 Just a word of caution to the retail investors. If possible stay on sideline tomorrow or cash out on stocks you don't like. Election result intensify the volatillity in market with the obvious reasons. Nothing is going away, many buying opportunities will comes in near future.
1725 2019-05-19 18:56:21 Even if it is a hard Brexit, the FTSE100 should do well, as the index is heavily weighted towards international $ denominated stocks. As the £ falls, the market should rise.

1728 2019-05-19 18:52:48 Stocks are my Favourite flowers for their scent and intricate petals
1729 2019-05-19 18:51:10 I don’t own a Tesla yet but I have enough stock to buy one... it’s frustrating talking with friends/ co-workers who talk stocks or cars and having to explain that what they read about the company and the shares is mostly false... or rehashed stories from older models or stories
1730 2019-05-19 18:50:24 You can see that the opposition atm is without any strategy now. Allows BJP to take dense sitters on their side.
Also, prevents falling of Adani/Ambani stocks for 3-4 days, which are sufficient for some profit booking.
1731 2019-05-19 18:49:57 Stocks... I had armfuls of them as presents for my 60th birthday .. the smell is divine
1732 2019-05-19 18:47:43 Yep, with stocks, it’s not good vs. bad firms. Second order thinking is the firm getting better or worse? The third is the firm getting better or worse versus expectations — in other words, price matters.
1733 2019-05-19 18:46:24 TIME TO SHUT YOUR SHOP AND SET IT UP ELSEWHERE ,, Time’s Up to finally redeem yourself ... you have thrown enough false one sided propaganda and hope you got paid well ... change of profession is also welcome  ,,, and yeah take enough Burnol, stocks might not last .
1734 2019-05-19 18:46:21 One day Sales of Burnol may surprise & startle its mfrs itself on 23/5/2019. 

Keep plenty of stocks as Maga, chotta, badaa, mini gathbandhans may need them in truckloads. 
1735 2019-05-19 18:45:59 I've been trading options for the past year and now it's time to start building a portfolio. Researching depressed stocks that pay dividends. $KHC $GT $BMY
1736 2019-05-19 18:45:32 It’s called researching credible sources. We don’t wait for people to “give” us info. A lot of our taxes went up, and it will continue to do so year after year. And all billionaires did with the money was buy stocks, not create more jobs. Trickle down DOES NOT WORK.
1737 2019-05-19 18:45:02 @hollyla_fon In regards Mr Ackman's comments vis a vis Lowe's. It is obvious to me, as a store level shopper, that he has never set foot in one of their stores; short staff, out of stocks, badly done installs...looking like KMart post-Antonnini.

Has real economy they supposedly represent soared anywhere near as much as stocks have in recent years?
Or are stocks also nothing but artificial inflation - and gambling?

1764 2019-05-19 18:31:57 & sir HDFC bank was also a midcap in 2008 but it didn’t fell more than 40% many quality mid-caps didn’t fell in previous recessions also so such stocks at 15P/E is everyones dream :)

But waiting for that valuations train chut jayege sir 
1765 2019-05-19 18:29:41 & something which such perfection sir can’t be available at 15P/E evry recession is different sir becozz of 
Increase in 
1)inflow of funds 
2)Awareness of investing (holding)
3)avaliability of information:) 

So in every recession u can’t expect stocks to be similarly cheap(2/2)
1766 2019-05-19 18:28:59 anybody know anything about stocks and stuff? i’m trying to fall in that.
1767 2019-05-19 18:28:44 Some notes on dividing market cap by # of funds. It helps in comparing two stocks of similar market caps.  Quick example using two stocks I don't own, $ACIA and $YETI, both with caps around $2 bil, but different sh bases. YETI has a cap/fund ratio of ~12.3 and ACIA of ~5.87.

1796 2019-05-19 18:07:37 Is the theory generally applicable for stocks which were falling till last week (auto and metals mostly) or even those which rose consistently to make highs on Friday (like titan, Bajaj twins,HDFC bank etc.)
1797 2019-05-19 18:07:33 Realism and optimism do coexist. If you believe in market data that predicts stocks will return x% annually (on average) that’s optimism supported by realism.

1824 2019-05-19 17:52:21 No, savings are not investment.

A healthy portfolio should have a good chunk in highly volatile cryptos, a good chunk in stable interest-bearing crypto, and then the standard stuff like ETFs, stocks, even gold, etc. My aim is to show *bank* savings as moot.

“Northants are a strong side with all bases covered. They’ve bolstered their stocks even further with a couple of loan signings of their own and we’ll have to make sure we’re at our best.” (otherwise it might last 2 days)
1827 2019-05-19 17:50:37 Debate? It was a simple question 

You don't see white people running around "hey man, have you heard about stocks?! You need to go get you some"

Seems like it's just you who've just made this new discovery.

1830 2019-05-19 17:46:08 #ExitPoll2019 showing a huge 42% vote share for the BJP/NDA combine, a full 12/13% ahead of the nearest opposition . Positive Indian stocks, bonds and currency INR. Political stability and continued structural reforms expected.Positive economy focussed sectors.
1831 2019-05-19 17:45:44 Why only black people think it's cool to brag about owning stocks in general. In the regular world, it's just another Sunday bro

1837 2019-05-19 17:44:19 I'm thinking that it might be time to bring back "stocks" and public shaming!

1839 2019-05-19 17:41:36 I was so disappointed they sent me an account maintenance fee to just hold leftover stocks from previous employer. Then they write a letter it is commensurate with services they offer. What the heck @UBS
1840 2019-05-19 17:41:26 Index ETFs & largecap company common stocks had some blocks move Thursday.. Friday saw a large increase in this activity.  Brexit is going to take everything down in short order..
1841 2019-05-19 17:41:23 When has buying stocks ever been a bad thing?
1842 2019-05-19 17:40:48 Yes. She’s stocks an amazing range of goods.

A dead economy for good-wage jobs, good-wage jobs downsized in droves daily past month, sky-high underemployment among working-aged - yet stocks have soared past year.

1849 2019-05-19 17:33:28 Math 101.  Trump supporters, well, the only math they care about is in their retirement stocks, folks who already are retired. They look away from Trump’s lies, etc and only care about their own !!  SAD
1850 2019-05-19 17:33:05 Yep. I assumed you were right! Why? It sounds like something either family would do. Sick fucking people. Sick and decaying old white outlook; they should be shunned. Or put in stocks and pray for a Good Samaritan to come along.
1851 2019-05-19 17:33:02 It's a combination of strong fundamentals (heavily weighted towards future EPS growth) & current technical strength. Generated from a database of 7000+ stocks. Then additionally sorted by group strength & delivered in order of RS.

1855 2019-05-19 17:31:00 Or what about the computer & now mobile phone ?? 

Have to agree though - blockchain will change the way we bank - will replace stocks and there will probably be blockchain loans / credit & mortgages.

Good job everyone here right now are the pioneers.
1856 2019-05-19 17:30:56 I'm no longer responding to bashers or critics. Everyone has a choice on who they follow. I will continue to spend countless hours researching and looking for the next unknown and undervalued stocks for us ALL to make money on. If you don't want to follow me, then don't. 
1857 2019-05-19 17:30:55 Should be put in stocks in local market place. A bit of old fashioned justice.
1858 2019-05-19 17:30:35 Imagine the head of Nasdaq tweeting “The 3 stocks we just added last week over 3xed in price! Nasdaq is the best place to list your stock!” They would have 20 pending investigations within an hour.
1859 2019-05-19 17:30:26 True same with UK or stocks and shares etc
1860 2019-05-19 17:30:12 They said we had 12 years.  I already cashed in my retirement, kids college, sold stocks, sold home so we can live it up for the last 12 years of earths existence.  God I hope they were right.
1861 2019-05-19 17:29:57 Mann people love talking bout, “Invest in stocks get portfolios” and that bullshit with no knowledge of how that shit actually works. Weirdos
1862 2019-05-19 17:29:32 And I just found out you can invest money into songs you think will blow up and can get royalties/dividends from them like stocks 
1863 2019-05-19 17:29:06 y’all conclusion based on evidence provided be weird. Fuckin weirdos. Do you even know about stocks to be investing money in them?

1867 2019-05-19 17:26:52 Funny how many believe Trump has done so much to make things better because they use propaganda techniques, repeating Economy good, Jobs up, more Judges, Stocks great, Wall built, most of us know this is all bullshit, but the Echo Chambers Power is immense.
1868 2019-05-19 17:26:31 But boy does it fatten the bank balance of shareholders of private prison stocks.

1874 2019-05-19 17:22:37 Lori Hendry, cut the crap about Trump’s economy. It’s Obama’s economy. The big tax break allows the rich to re invest their dividends, so the economy looks like it is exploding.... lies. Main st don’t own stocks.
1875 2019-05-19 17:21:04 Saw your post on Goons thread. Yellow Corvette, sick!!!! I'm looking to get into stocks. Currently building $$$ in crypto.

1896 2019-05-19 17:10:38 Your stock bouquet is beautiful love them so I'm gonna say stocks are my favourite
1897 2019-05-19 17:10:29 #win my fave flowers are carnations, but I absolutely adore the scent from night scented stocks.
1898 2019-05-19 17:10:04 I believe that we can do business with people regardless of political differences because when these businesses do discuss politics, they start getting divisive and cut off their economic ties, hurting their finances & stocks. And customers aren't going to be happy about that.
1899 2019-05-19 17:09:44 One bit of heartless advice I heard about investing in stocks years ago is to invest in things people have to have like tobacco or health care.

1911 2019-05-19 17:04:25 Comfortably investing $500 of my own EARNED money in my (risky) choice of stocks is a good fuckin feeling.
1912 2019-05-19 17:03:47 When bad things happen to good stocks, great things often happen for disciplined investors.
1913 2019-05-19 17:03:37 That a pretty impressive back up system. 
Assets like stocks,securities and couple of others are ok for this. 
Things like Dai and stuff.... Yeah don't use it.
1914 2019-05-19 17:03:24 Yes, but different direction of deltas should only work with different lookback period for the S/T than I/T delta, right? I mean if stocks mainly dropped last week to decrease # of S/T uptrends it is hard to imagine that # of I/T increased over the same period
1915 2019-05-19 17:03:09 Obama averaged 2.2 GDP during his tenure. With 5 quarters in the 4+ range and one at 5.1. American GDP outpace the entire world during his tenure. Considering that the world economy was in free fall when he was elected. I see nothing wrong with his numbers. Stocks equaled Trump’s
1916 2019-05-19 17:02:58 4 consumer stocks - McDonald’s, Starbucks, autozone and church and Dwight. Not surprising since we thought the world was ending but still want our food, coffee, baking soda and cars to keep running longer 
1917 2019-05-19 17:02:48 Some of us don't know how 2 B FATHERS. I wonder if Future has ever given his son any blue chip stocks or land as a gift. There are rites of passage. If he gets a Rolex at 5, what will Future give him at 19 or 21. I'm sure he's getting a prostitute for his 9th B-day.

1923 2019-05-19 16:58:58 Obama inherited a financial crisis brought about by failed Republican, trickle down policies. The only folks benefiting under Trump policies are his rich cronies. Tax cuts used to buyback stocks, not to create jobs or raise wages
1924 2019-05-19 16:58:23 Isn’t it wild how one of the most important scientific discoveries of my lifetime is being framed to the public only in terms of the financial risk and reward, like stocks.

1941 2019-05-19 16:44:57 The reason I feel #nifty may not end on a solid high is that many of its scrips are entering or near resistance levels. They may spike at open but I m unsure if those levels would be sustained so EOD price may become attractive.

1942 2019-05-19 16:44:30 Two words of caution for you too. (1) India is not Australia & (2) Buy Burnol immediately. Stocks will run out before 23 May
1943 2019-05-19 16:44:30 The economy is growing yes, but it's because the large corporations reinvested all that tax break money back into their stocks, making the market rise.  That tax scam bill did nothing for middle America!  It is a fake economic growth and yet you still lie about it!

1948 2019-05-19 16:39:39 Point. There's no fluctuation in FD. That's why stocks are the best option. But for people who can't take risk the FDs seem to be better option. Nd if you're talking about property. There are contingency expenses. It just doesn't end there.

1950 2019-05-19 16:39:15 My stocks aren't doing so well thanks to your garbage tariffs.  You're tanking the economy all by yourself.  Tariffs are taxes on Americans, or are you too dense to get that?  Just quit already.  If you don't, women are going to impeach you.  We are done with you.

1958 2019-05-19 16:34:01 Tomorrow 150 points gap up. Most likely PSU stocks maybe in favour on expectation of mergers. For example mmtc and stc, DREDGECORP.
1959 2019-05-19 16:31:58 I’m going long on all stocks in the stock market. That thing has been making money for years.

1964 2019-05-19 16:28:24 Isn’t it interesting that the world operates on this model of ‘majority’ wins? When inequality exists in all spheres of life, does this really define equality? how about weightage be given to individuals? Just like stocks & shares, the minority might get a voice on the table then
1965 2019-05-19 16:28:09 Do you think these numbers are for the Stock Markets? To reap rewards by selling off the stocks on a high before the election results are out? #LokSabhaElections2019
1966 2019-05-19 16:27:54 Transferring a portion of your savings from fiat, stocks, bonds to the bitcoin blockchain is, IMO, a good idea.  A few reasons for this:

BTC is sound money

BTC blockchain is secure

1970 2019-05-19 16:23:18 You know who reliably makes money from picking stocks? Brokers from commissions and “analysts” from subscription fees.

1972 2019-05-19 16:22:24 That was the same player they had him being ‘better’ than Neymar. Only highlight he has was that goal in the CDL. The rest, well, ruined. His player stocks have dropped extremely ever since joining Madrid.
1973 2019-05-19 16:20:20 Would also suggest investing in Dr Morepen stocks. UPA folks likely to buy burnol in large numbers over the next week or so.

1976 2019-05-19 16:17:28 No one should buy the ripples. I heard ripples a scammer and xrp is security. Bitcoin gonna burn down da banks. LOL. Ripples are stocks of ripples. I know big facts.

1982 2019-05-19 16:13:08 It’s so cute seeing Bitcoiners who think they understand financial markets, argue that stocks also dump because of large sell orders that come for no reason.
Bitcoin investors have really self-selected for utter ignorance coupled with absolute certainty. Like all pyramid schemes.

2031 2019-05-19 15:37:39 Gold stocks can be greater than physical gold during certain events, but it’s near impossible to predict.

2079 2019-05-19 15:02:38 I had this question for a very long time: how did Stocks make it place? It seems there may be billion of user who are not that obsessed about stock price - an external app would be fine.

2082 2019-05-19 15:00:49 Economics of election
If Modi wins, buy mutual fund,share,bonds.
If Congress wins, buy agriculture land, take agri loans
If 3rd front wins, sell everything, accumulate gold & wait for next elections within 1yr
If thr r chances of 2 elections within 2yrs, better buy liquor stocks!

2085 2019-05-19 14:57:08 The  recent  depreciation  of  stocks is something that has taken place not
only  in  Poland  but  all over the world, as a result of US trade tensions
with  China.
2086 2019-05-19 14:56:56 Well #GameOfThronesFinale is trending. Dude I need chocolate and a lot of it. Watch me run to the store to buy all of their stocks. #GameOfThrones
2087 2019-05-19 14:56:37 Sir, do you still see correction in stocks?? I believe you have predicted 2-3 months of turbulent period for Indian stocks from May
2088 2019-05-19 14:56:21 The Polish Zloty only really depreciating
,  caused  most  probably by depreciation of local stocks.
2089 2019-05-19 14:55:44 When governments manipulate the price of Bitcoin/Gold/Stocks/Bonds, it’s not called market manipulation, it’s called economic policy. Keep dollar-cost-averaging and smooth over price manipulation.
2090 2019-05-19 14:55:41 Exactly, My main source is from my AUM. I consider bitcoin like gambling but it’s a part of my overall investments portfolio. I treat it the same as a stock until it’s clearly defined with its use in the future. So I invest a portion the same time each month as I do my stocks.
2091 2019-05-19 14:54:13 Hey OTC MJ Stocks(@OTCMJStocks24), thank you for following me
2092 2019-05-19 14:53:55 He's manipulating the stock market with insider trading. Sell stocks, cry tariffs, watch price plummet, then buy when prices are down, then say "nevermind", watch prices rise, then repeat process and put profits in your bank accounts.
2093 2019-05-19 14:53:47 Bout to learn about stocks and bond next week 
2094 2019-05-19 14:52:56 If you wanna learn how to trade stocks hmu !
2095 2019-05-19 14:50:29 I don’t understand the mindset of someone who is willing to short #bitcoin.  Given the provable scarce supply, by being short, you expose yourself to the potential for unlimited losses.  You can’t conjure up more bitcoin (like you can with stocks, bonds, fiat).
2096 2019-05-19 14:50:27 There will be people who see value in the same stocks you do- others will provide an alternative perspective- I encourage not brushing it off, absorb it and stack it up against your own research. Bulls are better because of the bears and vice versa. You can still block the idiots

2105 2019-05-19 14:45:43 ah yeah... I’m not fluent with the language but from what I read, it seemed that acct said they’re afraid the company (S M) might reprimand K soo in case the use of HT would bring the company’s stocks down~

2110 2019-05-19 14:40:19 The number of blatent pump and dump accounts tweeting about #NCCL is ever increasing. Accounts pushing stocks like #PREM now getting involved. This is a huge red flag.

2134 2019-05-19 14:19:14 You are clearly clueless; I've NEVER said that one should blindly buy&hold random stocks. Even I don't buy&hold forever. 

I only hold if the growth story is intact; otherwise I cut my loss and move on. 

Plus, I hedge my portfolio during stock market downtrends.
2135 2019-05-19 14:18:29 I forgot i bought stocks
2136 2019-05-19 14:17:38 I would go back to penny stocks if no crypto.
2137 2019-05-19 14:16:29 NASDAQ & NYSE fewer stocks may be due to Trump's tax cut on big companies and using them to buy stocks back?
2138 2019-05-19 14:15:59 I just don’t understand why so many retail traders and ws continually buy insanely expensive tech stocks when they are offsides and in the wrong sector as of today. Watch. Wti 70-76 wcs 50-55. Imo. Fang to me is a ATM machine along with other tech names that you watch imo

2145 2019-05-19 14:10:15 Most people (not most dollars) buy Bitcoin/alts the same way the buy stocks: broker (exchange) and don't day trade. Just hold there waiting. Now, if you're talking about most dollars, nodes and keys are majority.
2146 2019-05-19 14:10:00 1) Each morning choose which stocks / futures / currencies you want to trade. Focus on 2

2) Make a plan set a risk

3) Always have rules iin front of you

4) Chose the A+setup entries only

5) Respect your rules

6) Always calculate how many $ you are risking

2154 2019-05-19 14:01:13 If you see stocks as blips on a ticker tape, you will be led astray. But if you regard stocks as fractional interests in businesses, you will maintain proper perspective. -- Seth Klarman

2197 2019-05-19 13:29:42 I have tested these rules: Rank stocks by P/B ratio. Rank also by earnings yield. Sum rankings and take top quintile. Buy the top 2. Sell 1 year later. Run once a month.
2198 2019-05-19 13:28:34 Yeah, yeah unemployment is low & the stock market is hi. But sky hi stocks benefit only the top 10% of wealthy Americans who own 84% of stocks & while more people r employed now than during the Great Recession, the vast majority of Americans haven’t had a real raise since 1979.
2199 2019-05-19 13:28:12 The caution flags are out all over the market. I'm going to reduce size and be a little more selective until I get confirmation that the market isn't taking a dump again.

2214 2019-05-19 13:13:32 Did you know the Trump actually violated the 2A as his supporters see it? He banned bump stocks, making them illegal for civilians to have. Is that not limiting open gun rights? Obama didn't even ban bump stocks, but Trump is protecting 2A?

2218 2019-05-19 13:11:32 One thing i could clearly see was my filter was favoring with current list. Since current list will have winners, it wont have underperformer/penny stocks. Since some current penny stocks could have been good performer in past.

2220 2019-05-19 13:09:18 Yeah, it's particularly a good deal for electronics, often. Like if a kid were starting college soon, I'd get them a Lenovo T-series laptop (T-440 and above) because they get cycled out from corporate stocks long before they need to be replaced. And they are tanks.

2222 2019-05-19 13:07:10 Stocks and real estate have taken on monetary roles which disrupts their real use as economic devices. Not sure what you are missing.
2223 2019-05-19 13:07:06 EVS was worrying, basically saying, "What if you lose money? You could lose everything." The odd part being that that could happen in the stock market, but nobody bats an eye when people invest in stocks.

Or fish will just disappear. That would be a great mistake ! Save our oceans fish for every generation !!!
2227 2019-05-19 13:02:40 Removing @Twitter today because they think they can control and suppress what THEY DEEM AS BAD.... can’t wait for their stocks to plummet when @POTUS takes action against these left wing social media depots

2233 2019-05-19 12:58:00 What other stocks do you like?
2234 2019-05-19 12:57:32 2015 pretty much. A lot of Apple products having been falling wayside since then. It's why Apple had a bad fall in stocks this year. Recently there phone sales were released too and they didn't do so well.

2238 2019-05-19 12:52:44 Recently, whilst browsing through trading/stocks & Shares websites, i have seen adverts on the web about trading in cannabis, cannabis stocks/shares ect, so perhaps something is on the horizon. Its estimated the UK cannabis market could be worth £10bn.

2240 2019-05-19 12:50:05 Stocks will rise. If climate change makes our waters to warm the fish have freedom of movement there is nowt to stop fish moving. I don't know why you are trying to label me as a farage supporting right wing racist but you are entitled to your opinion
2241 2019-05-19 12:48:19 One common blunder by many investors including me is ' to book profit in the best among the best stocks like sold HDFC bank years back'.
2242 2019-05-19 12:44:41 Stocks have been protected under the EU . Regarding stocks rising that’s not going to happen with climate change but saying that your leader Farage doesn’t believe in Climate change

2248 2019-05-19 12:41:34 @davidgura You might be a Republican who cannot believe in human caused climate change because you are heavily invested in oil company stocks.
2249 2019-05-19 12:39:58 I’m by no means an expert but maybe take a step back, reassess, and focus heavily on controlling downside risk (cheap stocks relative to current trading, high net cash etc.) Often find if you look after downside, upside can take care of itself.

There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks. (131)
2258 2019-05-19 12:30:33 And they do it all while making $170,000 a year. How do you become a millionaire if you have to live on $170,000 a year. It’s not possible. They used to be able to manipulate stocks by the way they voted. Now I guess they just collect from lobbyists
2259 2019-05-19 12:30:20 It's Sunday once again. Time to revisit your stocks portfolio and make trade plans for the week! #PHStockMarket #PinoyMoneyIQ
2260 2019-05-19 12:29:53 Good valuation stocks picking over price brackets is one strategy, patience and stomach needed! Predicting a definite market bottom is practically impossible.
2261 2019-05-19 12:29:05 I research ALL day every day , i just like to know what’s going on around me especially with the stocks I invest in 
2262 2019-05-19 12:25:39 Good idea! Maybe start with a stocks and shares ISA as well as a cash one
2263 2019-05-19 12:24:07 Wow, imagine that...a senator who doesn't realize bump stocks have already been banned.  What else doesn't she know?  A lot.  How DO these people manage to get elected in the first place? 
2264 2019-05-19 12:20:52 Intellectual compensation: If you have an idea that is better executed by a company vs a person, the company should pay via stocks or preferred stocks so the idea contributor can earn via increases in co. Value directly proportional to the specific earnings the idea effected.
2265 2019-05-19 12:20:16 The stocks I bought are the ones that I felt went down despite having good earnings.. I think people sold it to book profits.. so they will bounce back!
2266 2019-05-19 12:19:05 I accumulated basket of five big fmcg stocks in huge quantity during   recent downtrend... I am hoping good returns in long term....
2267 2019-05-19 12:18:04 And of course, stupid old UK could not have possibly protected its own fish stocks but need an unaccountable foreign power to do it for us because we are pathetic and can't do what is good for us ourselves?  Do you really think the EU loves the UK?
2268 2019-05-19 12:16:40 Sadly there are no deterrent in this country so people don’t get punished . It’s time out so called government brought in a better justice system where people are punished for the crime. For crimes like this we need stocks like they did in Georgian times

2272 2019-05-19 12:13:28 Yeah.. around 25k in bluechips and Pharma as it was down.. None in risky stocks

2274 2019-05-19 12:11:23 Beyoncé performed for Uber back in 2015 and instead of accepting cash she took $6 million in Uber stocks so she became a private investor before Uber launches their IPO on May 10th this year.

2278 2019-05-19 12:09:08 Okay, good timing then:)

Generally wouldnt buy stocks with money u might need.

Stocks could drop 50% short term. That wouldve hurt
2279 2019-05-19 12:08:57 Good chart/data. A lot of value investors look for a margin of safety, which on the surface implies some level of downside protection. That may be true sometimes, but value as a group stocks, are riskier. In theory, that additional risk is part what makes the value premium.
2280 2019-05-19 12:08:56 Calling Gundlach a contrarian indy is ballsy, but I like your confidence.  That said, if 10yr rates went to 6% we’d have a societal collapse.  Housing prices would drop 30%, stocks would drop more and all hell would break loose.  So not saying it’s not possible but not probable.

2291 2019-05-19 11:55:26 Another way I’d answer this question is by saying I wish I would have bought more shares of the stocks on my portfolio that have performed really well. I sometimes find myself saying “wish I would have bought more”. :)
2292 2019-05-19 11:55:24 Pure finance,  stock price based on investor's expection about the perceived risk,  so here investors expecting  very high premium from Aamir So his Stock price HIGH.. and those investing in his stocks will earn high return..

2297 2019-05-19 11:50:26 Perfectly fine for people that want to start investing but might not have the time or patience to research stocks. However, I also believe that everyone should experience buying shares of a company they love and seeing them thrive - which is what stock investing allows us to do!
2298 2019-05-19 11:49:17 but for cyclical commodities, mostly the stocks operate in that range and during cycle  upturn they give humongous return, ofcourse entry/exit matters.  paper/chemicals/sugar/steel  for example in 2015-2017
2299 2019-05-19 11:48:52 smart money is always fond of buying silently , without affecting price change in the stocks : which is called as accumulation . 

Lets see what happens .
these are just opinion , based on certain assumptions made , which may turn out to be wrong anytime .
2300 2019-05-19 11:48:41 I need someone to teach me about stocks

2318 2019-05-19 11:30:42 Yeah. I’m assuming he means tax assets more and tax wealth less. Like stocks and property are things he’d likely want to raise taxes on. So we do tax “wealth”, but I’d imagine he just means higher taxes on it instead of salary.
2319 2019-05-19 11:28:55 I can’t get my head around why congress is allowed to do this and also trade stocks.

2324 2019-05-19 11:26:48 We are forbidden from investing in debt or interest based, which basically excludes all bonds. Also certain types of stocks are not permissible either, so most index funds would disqualify as well. We also have to pay a 2.5% charity tax on all investments.

2. If Congress wins, agriculture land & take agriculture loans.
3. If 3rd front wins, sell everything, accumulate gold & wait for next election
4. If there are chances of 2 elections within 2 years, better buy liquor stocks!
2338 2019-05-19 11:13:04 Momentum rarely comes at cheap valuation. If you are momentum investor, prefer high growth stocks.
2339 2019-05-19 11:12:42 2/2 But because most of the new money is concentrated in stocks, no money trickles down to the rest of the goods/services out there? And therefore everyone not invested in stocks is punished extra?

2341 2019-05-19 11:09:09 “This is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to speculate in stocks. The others are July, January, September, April, November, May, March, June, December, August, and February.” Twain (Pudd'nhead Wilson's Calendar)

2343 2019-05-19 11:05:49 @econplusdal quick question about buffer stock systems... I've been taught to shift the demand curve to the right to show a government buying stocks, but I've seen on a mark scheme this being shown as a leftwards shift of supply. Is it okay to use either method?
2344 2019-05-19 11:05:03 Broadly agree but infra stocks do get affected by the ruling dispensation. The earlier dispensation pushed the entire EPC industry over the brink.

*Burnol stocks are gone,
2346 2019-05-19 10:59:48 I do similar but buying a co is more of an investment and possibly you are looking for a more secure investment. Stocks a diversifier and growth expectations higher.
2347 2019-05-19 10:58:50 If your investment strategy is based on the fact that good stocks will be at great prices due to the market oscillating between greed and fear, you will make money. The market isn't a robot.

2349 2019-05-19 10:56:47 You know somebody believes people should have control of their bodies; you're going to hate father time you want the illusion of control but I've knocked health stocks back and they still haven't come up with a cure to anything they havent cured we're going to need a lot of Jesus

2357 2019-05-19 10:48:07 I know many disagree, but the value of stocks/securities is as real or as unreal as the value of gold, money, bitcoin. We just grew up with the narratives that a security is a "real" value...

2364 2019-05-19 10:38:41 Sir, in my humble opinion, there is nothing called an election multibagger which can double in 1 week. We shouldn't focus on such things, only utilise any  market during this period to buy into stocks where we have deep conviction
2365 2019-05-19 10:37:23 "Hope" destroyed $AKAO, $SGYP, and countless other dev. investors. @RVH_Investing  takes a lot of crap from buthurt  'hoping' longs in failed stocks, but meanwhile, he's right 80% of the time. Smart people should follow him, as he's a self-,made multi-millionaire from doing this

In investing avoid stocks outside your circle of competence.

2368 2019-05-19 10:29:35 Option trading and structuring is the professional side. But worked at a discount broker in 2000 while in university and saw the aftermath of the tech bubble first hand. A number of stocks in this market remind me of that.
2369 2019-05-19 10:27:13 The other thing is, you can control your "income" by selling or not selling stocks at will. So if you squeak under the TFT, it's not because you're doing it tough. It's by choice.

To me, that's a slippery slope of "tax avoidance" that ends in the Caymans.

2374 2019-05-19 10:22:16 High quality stocks always have higher demand, hence higher price n PE. So wont consider PE, will consider price action and money management for good fundamentally strong stocks.
2375 2019-05-19 10:21:34 Get ready to watch exit polls funded by stock market bulls. They will make a killing tomorrow and when the stocks fall on May 23. #EXITPolls2019
2376 2019-05-19 10:21:14 I always used to think it and missed many multibaggers. Price is the expectation of people towards the stock, and it is driven by earnings and forseeable visibility. So follow price action for good stocks, ratios dont matter much in long run.

2399 2019-05-19 09:37:26 It would be poor management for any business not to explore options and plan for the future, seeing the harvest coming and being a user of around 1.7 million tonnes.

2414 2019-05-19 09:15:19 On the face of it, stocks reporting may appear helpful. 

In reality, depending on seasonal outcomes, it’s that vacuum of information that can create opportunities for growers.

2461 2019-05-19 08:08:00 Then that's the euro, dollars and stocks too. Define Investment...

2464 2019-05-19 07:53:57 Tomorrow will be amazing!

Markets will boom with real estate, banks, and high dividend players leading gains. 

The dollar will rise.

However, I wouldn't want exposure to renewable energy, healthcare, or education stocks. #ausbiz

2474 2019-05-19 07:35:05 What I find appalling is the total lack of TMC leadership remorse for poll violence unleashed across 7 phases of polling in West Bengal by TMC!! Mamatas unrepentant stance and vicious stocks on anything ‘Hindu’ ( Kedarnath visits too !!)drives more West Bengal voters to vote BJP
2475 2019-05-19 07:34:30 Found few stocks to trade next week/few days.
If #ExitPoll2019 comes in #BJP's favor will post the stocks, else those findings will be useless.

2484 2019-05-19 07:22:15 Interested in your take as well, Macro.

Labor policies were more loose fiscally in the near term

But dividend stocks may now be underpriced and notionally the removal of the threat to ban negative gearing seems supportive for the housing market

Supportive for wealth effect?
2485 2019-05-19 07:22:04 Given that a number of blue chip stocks have done buy backs or paid a special dividend in anticipation of an ALP victory, how is this going to effect dividend payouts next year? #asx #auspol #ausbiz
2486 2019-05-19 07:20:51 The more time I spend looking at charts, the more I realize that the mechanisms behind price action in crypto vs. Forex or stocks are the same. Crypto just moves in a slightly different way: more impulsive and less "organic".

This Trump has done something.

2522 2019-05-19 06:36:08 Many ways to trade in stocks but the easiest & most functional way is to look for Support/Resistance zone or Demand/Supply zone. Your probability of winning Vs losing is highest at those places. Tip: Never buy at resistance & never sell at support

2527 2019-05-19 06:29:46 Vanguard, Nutmeg, Scalable Capital - stocks and share ISA because of the tax benefits. Investing in those is a bit like being in a driverless car: you just top it up and it, largely does the rest.
2528 2019-05-19 06:26:58 Yes Vincents but have to agree with Michael overall, the stock effect means that we are already stuck with quite a few cars for 2030.

2540 2019-05-19 06:02:52 Very smart. Have you heard of M1 Finance yet. They do this for you. No direct dividend reinvestment. They just take any money above $10 and buy whatever will balance your portfolio. Been using them for almost a year. I love it. But, no mutual funds, just ETFs & stocks.

2544 2019-05-19 05:52:43 This probably isn't always and everywhere true - you can, I understand, keep sheep & goats on land which can't be easily farmed. (Is this still true with modern farming methods? I don't know) And as for fish, well, we could sustain stocks better, but you can't farm in the sea...

2547 2019-05-19 05:48:11 I mentioned it at the top of the reply chain. It began with server issues into maint then they tried a region lock blaming overseas for it and that didn't work either so it went into shutdown. Hit NIS's stocks really hard as a result and investors finally pulled out.

2550 2019-05-19 05:43:54 There was the famous Harper let them eat cake remark on the eve of the 2008 Great Recession (caused by his RW buddy, Dubya, @sunlorrie) that "Stocks are now on sale."  One of the most arrogant and ignorant statements ever made by a Canadian PM.
2551 2019-05-19 05:43:45 Interesting because I bought those 2 stocks (my only 2 at the time) about 15 years ago and I had the reverse outcome. GE is only at $10 and I bought in the low $30's. I bought CSCO at $16.
2552 2019-05-19 05:43:18 Like you I also sold out of TVS/Bajaj Finance early and missed sugar stocks because I too normally don’t invest in commodities. Isn’t there a lesson for us to pick real long term themes like Bajaj Finance

2560 2019-05-19 05:31:47 2019 May onwards will see a new era for public sector stocks ..all these so called operator and their fantasy for third grade promoters is a dream . Focus on companies with earnings yield and dividend yield in public sector ..
2561 2019-05-19 05:30:18 Just some thoughts from a slightly different angle Warwick,
If there was mandatory stocks reporting we would know for sure how much and what grain we have  and if the supply chain was more efficient imports would be less competitively priced 
2562 2019-05-19 05:30:00 He supported the 1990’s Clinton gun ban, then #Cult45 chanted, “only Trump will defend the second amendment” and then he bans bump stocks in a manner that if done by Obama their heads would explode, but Trump does it, and Meh.
2563 2019-05-19 05:29:35 _*Economics of these elections:-*_

1. If Modi wins, buy equity mutual funds and good shares.

2. If Congress wins, take agricultural loans and buy land,  preferably agriculture land in NCR.

4. If MGB wins, der r chances of another election within 2 yrs, buy liqour stocks.

2565 2019-05-19 05:28:14 Given the improving US economy & rising spends, #IT has emerged as a robust sector. Better days are ahead for this sector on account of improving deal pipeline & rising share of #digital revenues. Investors should consider adding select IT stocks to their #portfolio.
2566 2019-05-19 05:25:14 So I'm trying to become a more ethical person. Having to close bank accounts (that I don't agree with), shift around stocks including retirement (that I don't agree with), and looking at corporate culture is something I wouldn't have ever realized is important growing up.
2567 2019-05-19 05:24:53 Coins will effectively replace stocks, and I'm sure you understand how many different stocks are out there.  There will be millions of coins I assure you
2568 2019-05-19 05:20:36 I know how you feel. We just went back to cable (from Direct), but are considering going to an antenna and streaming devices. I love my re-runs (MASH, The Middle, Andy Griffith, etc.), my 2 soaps (most of the time), and a few cooking shows. Hubby loves golf, nascar & stocks. Ha.

2577 2019-05-19 05:12:08 But let’s go with your theory that most corps used tax breaks to buy back. So they bought stocks from only people that wanted to sell.  Fair transaction. They, at the same time,  increased the value that the stockholders have for those that wanted to keep the stock. 

Why u mad
2578 2019-05-19 05:11:00 I have family members who trade stocks and forex who can't grasp this idea.  Any suggestions on how to explain

2580 2019-05-19 05:10:05 I actually advocate that if you have a capitalistic country you should finance the nation through capitalistic means!  

That means the purchasing of investments such as stocks, bonds, gold, land, etc.
2581 2019-05-19 05:09:33 Yes, sometimes corporations like Disney do have a to many shares, then the stocks split and... wait...what?...my wife says that's not what it's about.
Nevermind.

2586 2019-05-19 04:58:10 No stocks hintay munaaa
2587 2019-05-19 04:55:58 Honestly even if he played in zone, he still showed elite anticipation when rotating on team help, great hands deflecting off the dribble, and over half of his blocked shots coming from behind on recovery.  Even w stocks cut in half, he's awesome.
2588 2019-05-19 04:55:38 Not starting early enough around the great recession and thinking I was a genius trading in and out of stocks.
2589 2019-05-19 04:55:15 Marico and Dabur both are comparing to smaller than what are in the list. Though both are excellent stocks.
2590 2019-05-19 04:52:36 *down 2 stocks to one*

2593 2019-05-19 04:48:37 So re u saying buying stocks from them is a total waste ????
2594 2019-05-19 04:48:35 There is a charity shop in town that stocks video tapes so someone must still use them.
2595 2019-05-19 04:47:50 In today's era, isn't this applicable only for a handful of stocks in the market? Like HDFCs of the world?
2596 2019-05-19 04:47:36 MOST of the companies used it to buy back stocks? Guessing you have no evidence of that to cite. Right?  Of course you don’t.  But I’ll let you off the hook for that one. 

Wages have increased since the tax cut so I’m not sure where you are getting your facts?  Explain?

2598 2019-05-19 04:44:14 I still can’t understand how people like S4 more than Ult... every problem, besides input lag, in Ult can also be seen in Bayo and/or Cloud in S4. You die early? Bayo. Getting camped? Cloud. Plus, you had only 2 stocks. 1 tiny mistake would lose you a game or even a set.
2599 2019-05-19 04:42:58 I refuse to let y’all bring my stocks down 
2600 2019-05-19 04:42:24 I think it's rather easy. If u dm me I can tell you which stocks r near their top and r gonna fall badly

You like Bayo killing you at 15?
You like Cloud limit camping you?
You like making one mistake and losing half of your stocks?
You like getting killed by Lucario at 10?
You like rage?
You like 7 of the top 8 being the same two characters?
2604 2019-05-19 04:39:05 Not buying stocks after 2008 crash.
Not going with my gut feeling while buying stocks.
2605 2019-05-19 04:36:18 No. Much like stocks in the market progress can take years to gain yet mere moments to undo. That’s what these gangster animals are doing. It will take decades to retain, if ever. Glad I’m not having kids!

2607 2019-05-19 04:30:13 Agree! #KSE plunged to 33K points. Highest loss since @PTIofficial @ImranKhanPTI came to power. Wise traders always buy in gloom and sell when everyone is rushing to buy stocks.  #BePositive .
2608 2019-05-19 04:21:21 so mukhang negative na sa bsa, kaya tutuloy ko na lang yung worth 2,000 stocks na nakuha ko sa COL Financial! baka yumaman pa ko 
2609 2019-05-19 04:20:42 Not sure how you figure that. They have money saved that they live on. Sure some might be tied up in investments or stocks etc, but it's their money, they are NOT receiving the pension. As such, they are self funded.

2612 2019-05-19 04:15:59 Global stocks fell in response to China’s retaliation against U.S. tariffs, stoking economic anxiety. Stocks around the world fell sharply on Monday as the trade war between the world’s two biggest economies showed little sign of ending soon.
2613 2019-05-19 04:13:34 apple stocks rise by 69%.
2614 2019-05-19 04:12:43 @DebraMessing  The rare earth element of cerium has been cornered by China they own 90% of the worlds stocks. Cerium is the key ingredient in making electric car batteries... Its like if China had bought all the Oil fields back in 1880.  Russia making nukes the size of pens
2615 2019-05-19 04:11:52 i'm going back to school next year at the ripe age of 26 and if any of these kids make fun of me in class i will not be afraid to flex the fact that i already have a retirement plan and am invested in stocks

I look back at all of the loss we’ve all had over time from their string pulling
From 911 to the average joe trying to make ends meet,but losing it all in a financial crisis

2629 2019-05-19 03:48:04 Agreed.  Look how many coins are .000001 of a cent.   You don’t see that shit in stocks.  

At least I don’t think so.  I could be talking shit.
2630 2019-05-19 03:44:39 Nice and lucky find! At moments it would be nice to live near a store that stocks anime stuff, but even they would have to import it, might as well save a few bucks and import it myself. Import blu rays are murder on a budget tho!

2632 2019-05-19 03:42:43 In trading the strategy on the Index, Options can be used. If trading on Stocks, Futures or Cash would be more appropriate

2635 2019-05-19 03:40:09 Economics of Elections

1.If Modi wins,buy mutual funds,shares
2.If Congress wins,buy land & take agriculture loans
3.If 3rd front wins, sell everything, accumulate gold and wait for elections within 1 year
4.If there are chances of 2 elections in 2 years,buy liquor stocks.

2640 2019-05-19 03:34:08 You have the opportunity of a lifetime to buy Bitcoin, and alt coins at a premium level right now. 

It's like buying Amazon, apple, or Google stocks at extremely cheap prices.

Don't waste the opportunity!

2642 2019-05-19 03:25:20 No, you're doing great! I just find it helps to flesh out the world a little more and finding the right name that stocks, rather than just coming up with something random.

2651 2019-05-19 03:10:56 Do you expect this would mean the other 50% gets incrementally invested into more of the same stocks, or the ETF would further diversify?
2652 2019-05-19 03:10:24 So it wasn’t a business investment to buy a club for £150m and turn it into a global brand worth billions? Whole point of a portfolio is to seek opportunities and create value. Warren buffet didn’t buy Coca Cola stocks because he wanted to make profit...

2656 2019-05-19 03:03:30 Well, @justinamash has now let us down once or twice. @realDonaldTrump let us down on the 2nd Amendment with a ban on bump stocks. Shall not be infringed. Seems many Americans (especially media, politicians and judges) have a major comprehension problem.

2666 2019-05-19 02:53:27 First do a sip for twenty years out of your salary or other income, then after look for trading stocks in your retirement.
2667 2019-05-19 02:52:27 Why, have they changed the definition sale?  Is college economics woke now dude? All Kidding aside, I was referring to not saleing off stocks out of fear of tarrifs.  These tarrifs will result in fair trade and brighter future for our kids.

2673 2019-05-19 02:47:36 I feel that you have to be in the market for many-many years to know what makes money. You have to invest in your high conviction, new found stocks, burn your fingers & see them crumble. That is when real lessons are learnt. #investing #stocks #stockmarket

2680 2019-05-19 02:36:22 They didn't say "gold stocks" or "bitcoin stocks" but fair game, @RampCapitalLLC ? @goldstocktrades
2681 2019-05-19 02:35:58 They’ll be saying “sir, how buy?”

 “I should have bought when btc was _____.”

Just like all the cunts that laughed at tech stocks in the 90s.

2699 2019-05-19 02:10:35 Empower us with FRIP taken from Scottrade clients. FYI, FRIP allowed investors to pool dividends and then allocate them to any 5 stocks/funds at any percentage, monthly at no cost. Balance holdings, built new positions. Awesome tool lost!
2700 2019-05-19 02:10:20 Tariff war is just a prelude of Cutting business ties between the two countries, I believe in ten years the real war will begin, buying stocks of anything military related might be a good investment.

2707 2019-05-19 02:01:16 Starting quite late.

Ray Dalio bought his first stocks at age 12 while Warren Buffett was 11 when he did the same. I began investing when I was 18. I'm approaching 30 and looking back, I feel like I missed out on an extra half decade or so of riding my country's economic growth.
2708 2019-05-19 02:00:07 With due respect, Vakrangee/Rain Industries were never really great stocks in the first place. The type of stocks which meet the ‘long term hold’ criteria include HDFC Bank, Asian Paints. Time is a friend of a great business & the enemy of a mediocre business

2712 2019-05-19 01:50:16 Well I guess after the election result in Australia we can assume that franking credits are safe? That might give some ASX listed stocks a lift on Monday?
2713 2019-05-19 01:49:13 Ya Allah memasing berebut stocks lipmatte  tolong lah cukup

LAST STOCKS
2715 2019-05-19 01:47:11 I was taking a finance class and we had to pick 5 stocks to track for the semester. I picked $NFLX as one of the 5. It was around $6 a share at the time. I regret only buying it in theory and not real money 
2716 2019-05-19 01:45:57 I'm not predicting anything, but I will say the time is ripe for a major market meltdown - in bonds, stocks, futures and currencies. Why? Many reasons, but paramount is the imbalanced U.S. bond yield curves and heavily-weighted credit flows within Southern Europe and India.
2717 2019-05-19 01:44:58 COMPASS UNITY stocks climb despite troubling geopolitical headlines
2718 2019-05-19 01:44:05 Low vol can have some crazy growth stocks that aren’t volatile cuz they only go up.

We use, and really like $VMVFX

It’s where we get the majority of our non-USA exposure 
2719 2019-05-19 01:43:50 You owe every time a trade is made if it’s profitable, and in Crypto the cost of accounting for the gains/losses is significant in terms of time and effort since it’s not really tracked well for you. Some services can help but it’s much more work than stocks.
2720 2019-05-19 01:43:36 I remember a portfolio manager in a late 2000 interview after tech stocks broke, saying, "look, the only way CSCO doesn't get back to 80 in the next 10 years is if we have a Great Depression." Lol, it's still not back there yet. No offense, but your comment sounds just like him.
2721 2019-05-19 01:43:26 let’s invest in these stocks, let’s vacate on these yachts, let’s go chill out in bali.....
2722 2019-05-19 01:41:35 I wonder if ishiship niyo pa B4M ko  Baka naman wala na kayo stocks, refund niyo na lang please. 
2723 2019-05-19 01:41:11 Nah, high yield stocks are the much better investment.
2724 2019-05-19 01:40:17 This rumour was in News in past/ present also on Social Media whether right/wrong that there is a difference of few Lakhs of EVM in physically stocks available with Election Commission&EVM Supplied/Manufactured by the Manufacturing Unit.
So must be verified at all costs/levels.
2725 2019-05-19 01:39:47 Does anyone else get excited about buying stocks !?
2726 2019-05-19 01:39:07 “To make money in stocks, you must have the vision to see them, the courage to buy them and the patience to hold them.” Patience is the rarest of the three. (George F. Baker)
2727 2019-05-19 01:38:42 Its performance also seems to be inconsistent through time (may not have been present before 1990) and across asset classes (exists in stocks but not in other asset classes). I'm on the fence about it.
2728 2019-05-19 01:38:28 I have two side hustles outside of my full time job and stocks
2729 2019-05-19 01:37:58 And I'll be there buying stocks from luxury car and goods companies.
2730 2019-05-19 01:36:45 We are the laughing stocks of bullpens.  Good job AA
2731 2019-05-19 01:35:35 London under such unthought-of information tending to be a liberty to think the stocks were conducted in life."
2732 2019-05-19 01:35:33 Pro tip. @ItalianCentre also stocks. Among other retailers I am sure.
2733 2019-05-19 01:35:27 Giving long-term prediction on prices of stocks based upon charts isn't really practical. All those splits, bonuses, etc activities happen and tend to skew the indicators. In short term it is great.
2734 2019-05-19 01:34:52 Remember how good the Canadian economy was during the Harper years. . The dollar and Canadian stocks have tanked since then thanks to liberal policies concentrating on fluff.
2735 2019-05-19 01:32:51 I Gotta Get More Into Stocks 
2736 2019-05-19 01:31:30 Don’t  fall victim to widespread panic and begin selling off stocks, because wealth-generating investments are long term.

2738 2019-05-19 01:31:03 How you do you feel about bundled stocks, like from Stash, Mint, or other investing company/apps?
2739 2019-05-19 01:30:22 They dont want their cronies to suffer them loss that make those cheap contaminated drugs they want us to shove down our throat every day! You know,the ones that have metal shavings,other fillers that are dangerous yet they keep their stocks high! And not only dems!Rhino's too!
2740 2019-05-19 01:29:41 For all my people that follow the stocks it's a buyer's market right now find a company you believe in & buy $100 worth of shares I BET you make a profit when the US-China trade-war ends because that's the reason EVERY price is so low at the moment
2741 2019-05-19 01:27:46 Stocks don’t just change in price ...
2742 2019-05-19 01:26:02 If you’re gonna try, at least try to fix your DI before the final hit of down smash. JW lost at least two stocks because he tried to SDI both moves
2743 2019-05-19 01:25:12 I think it’s a given we are all going to be unhappy given what’s happened so far. But... oof this doesn’t make me feel any better. *stocks up on wine*
2744 2019-05-19 01:24:53 Is there any other stocks like AXXA you can recommend
2745 2019-05-19 01:23:57 Yet,  Buffett has no plans to return any of the dividends that were recived from the bailed out bank stocks he owns.
2746 2019-05-19 01:16:27 These laws aren’t that old either, within the last 10 years.  And trump: he infrastructure spending, his ban on bump stocks, he trade policies. The only conservative policy he has is defense and boarder security
2747 2019-05-19 01:14:16 Do you still have it?
2748 2019-05-19 01:13:55 HE IS BRITISH GOVERNMENT FINANCIAL EMPLOYEE FOR STOCKS
2749 2019-05-19 01:13:16 More ‘hope’ market hype today, “As a “trade deal has become much less likely...what the bond market sees...likely is the Fed easing policy, a net benefit to stocks,”Gary Pzegeo, head of fixed income at CIBC U.S. Private, Marketwatch @LanceRoberts @michaellebowitz @DiMartinoBooth
2750 2019-05-19 01:09:20 No, it's use is to help flavor other things like stocks and soups. Alone it's stringy gross proof that creation is fallen. In the "holy trinity" it's a beautiful thing.
2751 2019-05-19 01:07:46 My stocks says Trump has kept his principles, all i care about.
2752 2019-05-19 01:07:23 not really, you just had trouble finishing stocks. Had you did the easiest parts - the edge guards compared to the neutral wins and combos, you would have won vs sfat
2753 2019-05-19 01:06:10 Your buying stocks right now and some people cant afford to buy stocks.
2754 2019-05-19 01:05:19 Trading will give back to you what you put into it. And then some #stocks
2755 2019-05-19 01:05:01 People who compare cryptos to stock don't have the first clue about the true power of cryptocurrencies. Cryptos are stocks, currencies, they can be staked and have utility. They will have market caps far superior to any tech company because of this simple fact! (1/3)
2756 2019-05-19 01:04:17 “That’s what life’s all about, man. Skateboards. Jesus. Trading stocks.” —overheard outside of Temple Square
2757 2019-05-19 01:04:12 long these stocks and short livestock commodities... so.. next one must be Unreal Foods? Vegan gluten free ... nightshades free too
2758 2019-05-19 00:59:41 Is not applicable for most routes. Old brics stocks are still in the midst of distribution
2759 2019-05-19 00:57:05 Honestly both do similar things but lucina the better option imo. Wolf has laser to force things, but I think Lucina doesnt struggle to set the pace at the end of stocks, which I think happens with cloud, where youre killing like 150 against some characters like snake or inkling
2760 2019-05-19 00:55:03 In 1993, George Soros made $1.1 Billion for the year 

Julian Robertson made $500 million 

Bruce Kovnev at $209 million 

Henry Kravis $56 million

2761 2019-05-19 00:53:17 IMRAN statement that we  have succeeded in offshore drilling was false Exxon’s stocks went up recovered there money. This is a crime  called inside. Trading
2762 2019-05-19 00:51:41 He is part of the cadre of Dr. Frankensteins who created their evil construct called Trump. He can’t save his soul now, anymore than you can, Bill.  It’s like Jim Cramer apologizing for ginning up stocks and ‘playing the market’ that led to the financial collapse in ‘08.
2763 2019-05-19 00:51:09 The wealthy own most of the stocks, so their dividens are substantial. The rest of us get bird seed. SO IF THE ECONOMY IS SO GOOD WHY ARE THE ONLY ONES BENEFITING FROM IT THE ONES WHO DONT NEED IT?????!!!!
2764 2019-05-19 00:46:47 One more thing: the second Ice Climber needs to learn how to fast fall. I've lost stocks in so many situations where Popo (I use Nana lead alts) fast falling would have absolutely let us both live.

2768 2019-05-19 00:44:41 Is providing logistical support and Intelligence to assist the Saudi Arabian and the UAE governments in bombing stocks of water,hospitals and school busses full of children courageous? Why haven’t you said a word about the atrocities we support in Yemen at all, not a tweet nothin
2769 2019-05-19 00:41:41 I appreciate the info(honestly) I just want to see salt stocks plummet again
2770 2019-05-19 00:41:34 When they come in with the bullets you prepare with the bombs  fuck being violent let’s get stocks and bonds
2771 2019-05-19 00:41:15 Also, as a small-gvmt guy, I suppose anything that violates the constitution is impeachable (banning bump stocks) but other than that, it’s a ridiculously weak case unless you’re taking the property rights angle.

2774 2019-05-19 00:36:32 At least we don’t have to worry about playing with only 2 stocks with this buffer. That’d be awful
2775 2019-05-19 00:34:16 We shorted many securities in 2015 including Chinese yuan, equities, other EM stocks, oil, and US shale stocks and MLPs. Had a great year. But we are much more short US and global stocks today, more short certain currencies as well.
2776 2019-05-19 00:34:04 Invest in stocks maybe and put some in the bank so that I can earn interest and make more money in the future.
2777 2019-05-19 00:32:03 Stocks rose under Barry because the Fed Reserve kept interest rates low and pumped printed money into the economy they called it “Quantitive Easing” and the unemployment rate was at 7.6% in 2009 when he took over. It ballooned to over 10% before falling to 7.9 % in 10/12...

2784 2019-05-19 00:23:10 Summer trading sucks.
I'm going to cash out and play with an account somewhere between $2-5k over the summer.
High risk/reward trades only. 
Goal: 200% growth by August 31st.
Still going to post daily plays, but will emphasize my smaller size trades more.

2785 2019-05-19 00:23:08 Millennials don't own stocks...Perception doesn't drive rallys...Trying to blame missing out on a 11 year bull market run in tech is pretty hilarious, maybe stick to mutual funds...Sorry for your luck!
2786 2019-05-19 00:20:02 he has money to rebuild it, but still there, why.
smart people know that is a notice and reminding others all the time.
I think that also is a reason he buy in the stocks of bank .

21 years before he know property worth money..

but.....
2787 2019-05-19 00:19:03 Could cause a short term rally in AUD potentially although I really think that is all driven by USD flows anyway. High yield stocks could get a boost. I think upside is probably limited by international factors though. I think the whole thing is Fed driven for now
2788 2019-05-19 00:18:33 What you think which stocks will be to return ! Also timenlines ? Do you think by year end

2840 2019-05-17 23:40:12 Yeah, I understand. Lol. Everyone who invests in gold says this. For me I would prefer to invest in something that provides income. The long term growth rate of gold is not encouraging too. For me, stocks > gold.
2841 2019-05-17 23:39:27 His base, who primarily don’t own any stocks, are cheering for a guy whose sole motivation is to increase stock prices. Yep, makes sense. 
2842 2019-05-17 23:38:04 Also depends on what the rumors are. If the rumors are good for the company then even the stocks will increase their value. But at the same time in the future will be dangerous, the company will be facing a big issue trying to grow continuosly based on a fake reality.
2843 2019-05-17 23:35:31 Not sure what it is I can help with?
@Diskcartguy happy to give my modest advice on any specific question.
I've been harping on for the last 6 months how declining stocks - both Vitas and games - is making it increasingly difficult and expensive. Not much one can do about .. /2

2845 2019-05-17 23:34:00 It's not just the pharmaceutical companies,  it's also congressmen & women who have taken their $, have stocks in their companies in exchange for getting as many kids in schools as possible on their drugs. You all are drug pushers in the name of power and lining your pocket.
2846 2019-05-17 23:33:39 $SPY  In these type market conditions:  I'm not looking for strong confirmation (buy signals) which too often come significantly higher.  It's worked well for us, especially with recent IPO's No doubt some of the best performing stocks despite these volatile market conditions.

No chance of ousting MickMac, but hopefully ALP can do lots of damage to LNP stocks elsewhere
2860 2019-05-17 23:19:46 At the end of the day, try to compare $SPY  ytd  %gains with  our stocks is a good exercise .  When SPY  is weak & our stks holding well, means they R good . & when they R close to or  hit ATH like $OKTA $TEAM $TWLO $ZEN $ZS ....etc means they R excellent .
2861 2019-05-17 23:19:28 Bad labeling to say "credit market."  If he had just said "rate market"  he still has a bit of a point that T-Bonds implying either ultra-dovish Fed (bullish stocks) or a recession (bearish stocks)...but that is not much of a point of course.  I like Crescat overall as thoughtful

2878 2019-05-17 23:04:57 But if he is able to escape relegation and have them close to top 10, say 12th or 13th then can you imagine how much his stocks would rise?
2879 2019-05-17 23:02:48 Dr. William Wolkstein, would you please disclose how much your holdings are in $ABMD.  Seems like you are a disgruntled investor.

2888 2019-05-17 22:57:16 Na corporations are trying to make things cheaper and sell them at a higher price. Buying direct from small businesses is the best way to bring REAL economic change to real people and not just increase the value of stocks. fuck @amazon and @Walmart and fuck @realDonaldTrump

2890 2019-05-17 22:55:58 Well, let's say financial instruments are taxed a percentage point; including speculative investments, stocks, bonds, derivatives, futures, ect. in America. Would the modern banking industry see even more consolidation or would it actually open it up for new blood.

2900 2019-05-17 22:49:18 With the way some of these ladies talk about charms in Pandora, you’d think we’re selling stocks here or something lol
2901 2019-05-17 22:48:34 Bump stocks was totally banned from ownership two months ago.
Obama couldn't do that from 2010 to 2016.

Don't tell me you didn't get the memo!
2902 2019-05-17 22:48:30 Do you think the upgrade cycle from central to global hvac could make JCI/UTX/LII hotter stocks?
2903 2019-05-17 22:46:24 Those that got in early made a fortune!  I trade AMD daily or every couple days and make my money on it. Not going to do many stocks this summer. I like reading daily!!!
2904 2019-05-17 22:45:36 On one hand IK govt seems relying on investments! It keeps encouraging ppl for businesses. But who would invest in such devalued currency? Such uncertain stocks! Such fluctuating economic conditions? Mere words of IK wont bring in investments like votes!

2908 2019-05-17 22:38:46 Well. I just happen to see weed stocks last year on someone’s Facebook.  So joined a group and started researching. Yes, I bought the highs!. I’m finally good now and averaged down. They dropped as soon as I bought!!!
2909 2019-05-17 22:37:56 Think key for the average investor is to avoid drawdowns. Not easy but if made the goal that is half the battle. Let's look at preferred stocks as an example. They are anchored by the buyback price usually 25. So if they hold their dividend they won't go down. Why r they unloved?
2910 2019-05-17 22:37:53 Yeah i considered that as well as doing spreads into each rollup, but depending on how many stocks (out of my top 10 names) im managing, i either run into risk management, psychological, or BP issues, whichever comes first lol. so trying to simplify the process as much as possib.
2911 2019-05-17 22:37:06 Is there any ways to invest with stocks in Space X?

2913 2019-05-17 22:36:42 I see artists talk about it a LOT when they’re selling, most of the time it’s someone stealing a pin or charm they’re too sorry to pay for. Other times I’ve heard of people stealing whole stocks of inventory. People suck :/
2914 2019-05-17 22:36:29 Can’t overtrade, stocks hit their highs first top/bottom 30-45 min of day on avg, rest of day is choppy until 3pm
2915 2019-05-17 22:35:46 $PRPO Said it on RBZ as well. Dont give away your shares. Hold strong and wait for a PR. Stocks reachs quite well to them. Should see major upside!!
2916 2019-05-17 22:35:45 Completely stupid... but you better understand it if you are going to trade stocks.
2917 2019-05-17 22:34:57 Santa question for you. Do the caps suggest stocks and trends? Is perhaps something coming down the pike about insider trading?
2918 2019-05-17 22:34:27 I love that my grandpa told me to put my first paycheck into specific stocks like I’m not going to start portioning parts of it out for cosplay fund
2919 2019-05-17 22:32:54 On Monday state bank will float dollars in open market to stabilize it which they promise otherwise 20% more devaluation is expected on IMF terms and conditions. Today investors lost 150 billions in one day after stocks market crashed again

2935 2019-05-17 22:19:56 Zero sum so of course. People don’t understand that with stocks you at least have the wind at your back. Anything else and it’s zero sum and you have to pay to trade it, which makes it a negative expectations game.
Very few can make money in that environment.
2936 2019-05-17 22:18:54 Honestly had no idea options were through the app as well. I don’t buy big board stocks so I avoided it, but this is amazing! How’s the interface and what are your thoughts overall?
2937 2019-05-17 22:18:34 "So you don't think .223 ammo does more damage to a human body if fired  from a semi-automatic weapon with high capacity magazines using bump  stocks?"

Bullet for bullet, no.  But the high volume of fire from the Vegas shooter allowed more bullets to hit.
2938 2019-05-17 22:17:24 Idk where the man got his money from but it definitely wasn’t from holding stocks I’ll tell you that much
2939 2019-05-17 22:17:13 Bernie Sanders is a do as i tell you not as i do politician. Why doesn't he bring up that congressional people can do insider trading on stocks. That's one of the biggest way they become millionaires.
2940 2019-05-17 22:16:30 Yes we do know why. Bitcoin historically soars around the blockchain week as new announcements are out. It’s kind of like the earnings season for stocks. This week, we learned we can use Bitcoin at #WholeFoods and that the SEC is onboard. That’s enough reason for me to be bullish
2941 2019-05-17 22:14:50 Stocks go up and down.  You can't sue cause you're mad you lost money. You just wait till they rebound.

2945 2019-05-17 22:10:10 Most beginning traders risk far too much on each trade and greatly increase their chances of wiping their account even if they have an otherwise valid trading style.

2946 2019-05-17 22:09:47 Another important thing to note is that - you have to diversify your portfolio. Don't invest in just one firm. Buy the stocks or two or more firms to diversify your risk and limit your loss
2947 2019-05-17 22:09:04 If I sold all my xrp right now you all know it would jump to over a dollar.Hahhaha I should start a business of getting in crypto’s and stocks and having people pay me to get out. #xrp

2952 2019-05-17 22:03:07 Did Plan B stocks go up?
2953 2019-05-17 22:02:51 But you also support freedom for anyone to buy bump stocks, ARs, armor piercing bullets, unlimited magazines, etc correct? Idiot.
2954 2019-05-17 22:00:52 The idea behind buying stocks is to invest in a good, well-managed companies that in turns gives you a profit.

For example, if you bought 1000 shares for #100 each and the share appreciates in value by 20% during the period you own it, you've earned #20, 000 and vice versa.
2955 2019-05-17 22:00:43 J’ai mis la cloche moi si elle refait un réassort je t’envoie un message directe ! (Ou au pire des stocks s’écoulent extrêmement vite, je t’en prendrais une si la bourse est rentré  et tu me rendras plus tard )
2956 2019-05-17 22:00:08 What about when they lose all their stocks tho
2957 2019-05-17 22:00:04 We all know the market is corrupt and a fraud casino but during these difficult times to see stocks go up x 11 yrs has been absolutely insane. A nightmare that we still haven’t woken up from. cnbc is a govt agency. It’s soul purpose is to psych us out. We have been saying for 10
2958 2019-05-17 21:59:08 Save more for retirement. No magical thinking-just invest in dividend paying stocks and don’t touch!
2959 2019-05-17 21:58:48 We are the generation that is quick to wake up and jump straight to our phones to check emails, stocks, social media. Whatever the case may be Some of us have wonderful people next to us, give them a hug and kiss, tell them good morning. #littlethings
2960 2019-05-17 21:58:10 Yea usually best time to jump in but sometimes does stocks go down like crazy for example SNAP AQMS awhile back. Just want u to be extra extra careful . Today was a red day(lose) profit but I just moved my money from one coin to another and  maximizing my profits when

2962 2019-05-17 21:57:04 Cramer: You and most Americans, Westerners, world citizens do not understand one thing: this is the last chance civilization can defeat the Chinese Communists. It's not about stocks, your life will be totally destroyed if not doing it now. You will be treated like a Chinese
2963 2019-05-17 21:55:30 Stocks are ending on losses, just like the week started. Trump, king of losses.
2964 2019-05-17 21:55:28 Lol. Well, first thing is to have an understanding of how the stock market works, the particular shares of the company you want to purchase.

For a first timer- Finding a good online broker is advisable. The broker helps with the selection of good stocks and professional advice
2965 2019-05-17 21:55:28 Ratings for the sheep!  As usual; you all are behind!  Only the informed innovators will make money here... the rest of you are after the fact.   @CNBCFastMoney stick to stocks!
2966 2019-05-17 21:53:57 I agree and I’ve kept that in mind when it comes to some of the stocks I’ve looked at. Primarily focusing on some technology stuff right now but I’ve bought some stuff that is low right now that I’m sure will go up later. Sometimes when everyone is getting out it’s good to get in

2968 2019-05-17 21:52:53 Then that is a completely different conversation. What I’m saying is that what he was doing in his sessions work. How he makes his money is a whole other massive topic because he has multiple businesses and stocks etc which I don’t know too much about.
2969 2019-05-17 21:52:39 The pension thing was much later in the episode, talking about how there are so few left.

It was just the massive disconnect between "stocks seem like they shouldn't exist" and "more people should benefit from dividends" that hurt my brain.
2970 2019-05-17 21:49:16 Price steadily going up. Gotta get it while it's hot cuz the stocks are rising 
2971 2019-05-17 21:48:54 You losers was sure waiting for this moment to happen, like this isn’t happening with the main stocks
2972 2019-05-17 21:47:24 If u ever thought to participate in Indian markets, last week n coming week is GR8 time for first timers as well other to *INVEST* in Financial ASSETS(Stocks,Mutual funds,LUMPSUM SIP's etc). Though we have Elections as binary event for short term , 1/n
2973 2019-05-17 21:46:36 Love you Sven, I can’t stand all the lies of the past 11 yrs. all we have are ridiculously overpriced stocks. The highest in history. Massive. ULTA, ADBE, MSFT,AAPL, AMZN, FB, AZO, ORLY, INTUNIV, VRSN, the cloud, the biotech you name it. Biggest fraud bubble in history.
2974 2019-05-17 21:45:59 This isn't economics, it's not stocks, it's not a religion.  It's a considerably more complex set of parameters at play here; there is no optimal zero-slope first derivative in Bitcoin's perpetually increasing fee structure.  Get your head out of the books.
2975 2019-05-17 21:44:58 My stocks are down today looks like I’m eating ice for dinner smh
2976 2019-05-17 21:43:52 David, I'm gonna fuck your healthcare stocks and they're going to leave you for me
2977 2019-05-17 21:43:17 Still trading Chinese stocks?
2978 2019-05-17 21:43:16 Carolyn, they have been lying for 11 yrs.The economy is only slightly better then 2008 but they have been obsessed w pushing stocks higher in the jobless recovery.They are lying about unemployment rates.most Americans are dead broke and in debt. And they printed 250 tril globally

2981 2019-05-17 21:41:23 Oh I was definitely on an episode where we talked about stocks though my position is a bit different. The Canadian pension fund doesn't ring a bell though.
2982 2019-05-17 21:40:11 I feel like dk kinda needs it and it's not the hardest thing to get consistent with so you've gotta keep practicing it and trying it in tournament even if you lose a couple of stocks from SDs
2983 2019-05-17 21:39:52 Didn’t help my stocks. Trump is not a very good wealth creator.
2984 2019-05-17 21:38:51 This is exactly why, to choose stocks, I just through darts at a board, blindfolded.  No cognitive biases!!!!

2988 2019-05-17 21:34:43 You are wrong. They do watch closely. They count the ammo used and when the stocks deplete to a certain level they warn for procurement. You get everything the wrong way

2998 2019-05-17 21:32:57 Hi Sarah, it should be available in most retailers until stocks lasts. Easter eggs are seasonal products we're afraid.  Maybe you might want to try our Milky Bar Mix Ups? 
2999 2019-05-17 21:32:52 Yeah, right? But, our year over year gains are ridiculous. My in laws' house gained like 1/2% in 10 years. That's what housing should be. Not an investment option like stocks.
3000 2019-05-17 21:31:11 This is why i don’t celebrate till i hear the cha ching. Also, why one of my new rules (that i will probly break) is not having positions on stocks through earnings. Good luck next time.
3001 2019-05-17 21:25:54 I never realized how exciting it is to buy / sell stocks 
3002 2019-05-17 21:25:00 We need to bring back the stocks for people like that!
3003 2019-05-17 21:22:59 Well, I don't think we have stocks anymore.
3004 2019-05-17 21:22:44 Not the best time to be investing stocks cause of the potential tariffs of taxes that will hit wall street it's already bad right now alot of stocks are down so be very careful. I invest too but not in stocks anymore wasn't worth the time and the feess
3005 2019-05-17 21:21:58 That appears to be the case. Likely acting as Market Maker to balance ETF NAV with unit market price. They appear on all component trades as a buyer.. taking in $ on ETF unit sales then buying shares of component stocks. 
3006 2019-05-17 21:20:46 I’d buy a host of different call and put options on different stocks with high potential for momentum ie earnings reports, news in general, stock IPO’s. Ppl do it every day actually 
3007 2019-05-17 21:20:15 Y’all really don’t got stocks or bitcoin? HA
3008 2019-05-17 21:19:51 $BABA and $NVDA are down about 13% over last 10days. I view this as over sold and should bounce, but I was wrong this week but I still think both of these stocks are due for a large bounce.
3009 2019-05-17 21:18:26 And he kept pushing stocks higher. I’ve never in my life seen a more corrupt market. Tremendous stock prices and market caps. Absolutely colossal. The past 10 yrs have been economically horrible. Educated ppl couldn’t find jobs or at least good paying jobs and either no health -
3010 2019-05-17 21:18:20 Jesus continue to bash if every stocks go back to warrants price it will be known.. This conclusion makes no sense.. I agree that charts are made by trading. They are a good indication of some risk to take or not nothing more. Gl to you and don't dream too much about warrants..

3044 2019-05-17 21:02:05 A marketing firm that works with publicly listed companies can use clients’ stock price as a guide. Companies that trade at growth multiples tend to “invest” in marketing. Income stocks (low multiples) tend to mean the company views marketing as an expense to be minimized.

3062 2019-05-17 20:52:11 Growth stocks can easily be priced very incorrectly, they are much more subject to psychological swings and herding.  But, they offer many arbitrage opportunities.

Has the long-term record on US stocks overstated global returns? Well, UK results have been even higher:

1955-2019
US Market = +10.4%
US Large Value = +12.3%
US Small Value = +14.8%

UK Market = +10.3%
UK Large Value = +13.1%
UK Small Value = +16.5%

Datacenters have stopped expanding, AMD has forced lower prices, CPU shortages are hurting new PC sales, crypto is gone and it's hangover hurts, Tesla built its own AI chip, trade wars with China, ray tracing lacks appeal. Ugly stuff.
3086 2019-05-17 20:37:36 We had the same situations before were stocks were strong and options went to 0
That’s why I asked the question
3087 2019-05-17 20:36:10 Funny, I did the same.  Chinese stocks are all cheap rn
3088 2019-05-17 20:35:44 "When the Bank of Canada speaks, people listen." Well, I sure hope they do. We're facing an existential threat and these people are worried how their stocks are going to perform?
3089 2019-05-17 20:34:32 AAAA THANK YOU SO MUCH!  T_T  also, I didn't know it was you who ordered them! I would've added some left over zelda stocks for you too ;_;
3090 2019-05-17 20:33:57 25 years when I was a financial advisor, my dad gave me $100,000 to buy equal amounts of 20 blue chip stocks. He’s never sold a single share, nor has he bought either. Reinvested all dividends.

By far, his best performer is McDonalds. It’s up over 1,200%. Fast food = $$$
3091 2019-05-17 20:31:46 Middle class of Pakistan has hugely suffered because of PSX crashes; their entire life savings were invested in mutual funds and stocks

3094 2019-05-17 20:30:32 Maybe he meant 2 stocks at 420
3095 2019-05-17 20:30:30 I don't believe that was correlated to stocks as much as some believe. The data on the number of households who actually own stocks aligns with my view. I'd argue that rising interest rates had more impact.

3102 2019-05-17 20:27:19 The feel of this market way different from 1999. Inflation actually is extremely subdued. Darlings climb, but they also get chopped back down. IPOs not being wildly embraced. Debt a real concern and we read about it daily on Bloomberg. Gold stocks at very generous valuations.
3103 2019-05-17 20:27:18 Consumer confidence is going to collapse as prices rise due to the increased tariffs. Most consumers don't own stocks and an even smaller percentage base purchase decisions on them.

If a country doesn't allow the US companies access to their markets, plain and simple, they shouldn't have access to the U.S. market.

3117 2019-05-17 20:22:09 Manipulation has always been the key factor in our market. The market was bleeding in 2015. One of the reported reasons for it that some of the AMCs were under investigation by SECP. So the stocks were being dumped to pressurise the regulator to back off.
3118 2019-05-17 20:22:01 No sir, just small cap stocks
3119 2019-05-17 20:20:50 Malik gave 4 runs in 2 overs and got a wicket too but Sarfraz decided not to give him ball again as pitch was slow and english batters were looking nervous against spin so 1-2 more wickets over there would have hugely raised Malik’s stocks ..

3130 2019-05-17 20:17:14 If it goes to 0.80$ later on then it's none of my problem cuz i'll be out the door but i agree that investing or swing trading these stocks at the highs is just being the late comer that's being handed the stage at the end of the event.
3131 2019-05-17 20:16:20 also almost all stocks are not properly priced right now in the market

3138 2019-05-17 20:12:37 So Trump creates a fake crisis and the stock market drops! He and his rich friends buy the stocks at a low price.  Then when the stock market recovers a few days later they cash in. They may have also dumped their stocks the day before the fake crisis if they were tipped off.

3210 2019-05-17 19:42:22 You don’t seem to know much about cryptocurrency or their market, should probably stick to stocks you sound pretty dumb. I’ll be over here enjoying my 50% jump in past 3 days
3211 2019-05-17 19:42:07 Stop asking about stocks, forex and crypto so you can focus on getting a properly allocated portfolio that’s going to get you better than piss poor returns!
3212 2019-05-17 19:41:56 If you own a telsa then watch out for speculations about the autopilot crashing. Only thing crashing right now are the stocks #tesla
3213 2019-05-17 19:41:45 Anyone want to teach me about stocks and investments...
3214 2019-05-17 19:41:42 Hate when my healthcare stocks are carrying another man’s seed and the village laughs at me behind my back
3215 2019-05-17 19:41:23 Trump is enjoying very nice touching game with Ivanka, kiss her in the tone. Trump is euphoric for shorting his stocks accounts. Trump’s family was grown by eating shxt
3216 2019-05-17 19:41:01 He says this because of his OWN "ANONYMOUS SOURCE" calls to FORBES  and rumors he started to gain from stocks, investors and so on. SO he naturally thinks anyone else is the same...
3217 2019-05-17 19:39:49 Whats up with tesla stocks? #teslastocks
3218 2019-05-17 19:39:49 $XBI $IBB - Long set of tweets! Cutting Bio positions today, because I don’t like the market. Not so much judgments on the individual stocks - I’m having a pretty good year and want to keep it that way. It’s OK to get flat – really, it is. Those who followed me last year...
3219 2019-05-17 19:39:44 These people who call 911 to complain should be fined, put I The stocks for a week without food or water, and then we should get tough with them! Seriously, these people are clearly not part of society
3220 2019-05-17 19:39:12 Everyone short $LK to stick it to China on stalling trade talks. Hell, short all Chinese stocks. Game on! $BIDU, $BABA
3221 2019-05-17 19:37:42 lots of stocks down on lower volume though
3222 2019-05-17 19:36:38 No, we don't promote stocks at all at NCV. Have you ever seen anything on the site that looks like stock promotion?
3223 2019-05-17 19:36:29 I’m gonna fuck his healthcare stocks in front of him
3224 2019-05-17 19:35:16 Great point, I like that idea! Any thoughts on gold or gold stocks? Also, looking at $AA $FCX $CENX $X and some other metals, any opinion on those, seems like they are getting to a good buying range?
3225 2019-05-17 19:35:04 No end to the uncertainty:

Stocks dropping after CNBC reports that US, China trade talks stalled; scheduling discussions have been put on hold since the White House targeted Huawei  #ChinaTradeTalks
3226 2019-05-17 19:33:52 @kaylatausche sounds like you are an idiot - we all knew about stalled trade talks- you just wanted stocks to go down - time for SEC to look into you
3227 2019-05-17 19:33:52 pour le coup ils peuvent faire autant de fautes qu'ils peuvent du moment qu'on se fout pas de ma gueule à annoncer des stocks faux et me balader depuis un mois ça m'est égal
3228 2019-05-17 19:33:38 Peut-être oui mdr. Mais c’est pas la crédulité des fans qui me posent problème c’est surtout que le foot est bien trop tourné vers le financier. C’est vendu comme un hommage alors que c’est juste une façon d’écouler les stocks de maillots mdr
3229 2019-05-17 19:33:23 .@edponsi has 3 consumer staples stocks for a volatile market:
3230 2019-05-17 19:32:18 i know, i'm more trolling the gold bugs.  i'm not a fan of either since i'm long term and can handle the volatility that comes with stocks
3231 2019-05-17 19:31:47 Do you think most Americans know that their elected representatives are allowed to trade stocks on inside information that would put any of the rest of us in jail?
3232 2019-05-17 19:31:31 Just to be kind the powers that be will push this back above the 50dma or on it. But if you did not take some off on all the bounces we have had this week then shame on you as this has been a gift to raise some cash and rotate in to DIV safe stocks as a storm is coming next week!
3233 2019-05-17 19:31:21 Whew a Mako, been a hot minute since I used one, my kid plays with Scott Gomez pro stocks cut down actually

3235 2019-05-17 19:30:56 Ese tema ya no lo tengo tan claro. Pero pongamos que lo suyo sería usar imágenes libres de derechos, de bancos de imágenes, stocks de pago, etc etc etc y/o referenciar los resources.

3238 2019-05-17 19:29:45 Over the past few years, I've learned how to grow food, make stocks, bake bread, make tinctures and syrups, pickle things, got a rain barrel for plant irrigation, and am starting to learn to compost...

Have I been lowkey preparing for the apocalypse in my subconscious?
3239 2019-05-17 19:29:23 Thats not accurate. If you pick individual stocks, many underperform. The mix of companies in the S&P 500 varies quite a lot, as do their rankings. You're generally pretty safe investing in indexes but you can make it big or lose it all trying to pick individual winners.
3240 2019-05-17 19:28:01 Lol I need to start trading stocks! Even if you know nothing about trading you can make a lot of money by listening to reports about trade talks..
3241 2019-05-17 19:27:46 The Dow Jones Transportation Average has outperformed the Dow Jones Ind. Avg. year-to-date by approximately 4%. Do you believe the outperformance will continue throughout the rest of the year? #FWRI #stocks #market #transportation #logistics #freight #poll

3244 2019-05-17 19:27:21 I think folks are smarter than that by now, they realize that tariffs yes, tariffs no, China retaliation yes, retaliation no, negotiations yes, negotiations no, are all meaningless things.  As long as everyone shuts the fuck up, stocks can keep drifting up like this week.
3245 2019-05-17 19:27:13 Would the #slavetrade care if they punched #merica in the stomach for a while to lower #stocks pricing while they buy it cheaply using #stolenwages and #foreignfunds?
3246 2019-05-17 19:26:56 ...hay hun...I just finished mowing the yard--true story
Did I miss anything? Not really?  Are you busy now?
Not really, ok will do. Can you believe these markets?
1 day up, 1 day down. The Healthcare stocks are climbing
a wall of worry. How is that light sweet crude doing?
3247 2019-05-17 19:26:52 I think that’s a smarter, albeit safer, investment strategy. I’m big on weed stocks, which I know is cliche, but buy what you know...
3248 2019-05-17 19:26:48 U.S stocks gains after @POTUS extended 180 days a final decision on whether to impose broad tariffs on cars from Japan  and European Union  citing national-security concerns
3249 2019-05-17 19:26:40 I wonder if he or his criminal family are shorting stocks based on his speeches and tweets.  When you meet with Russians to get campaign dirt on your opponents,  you would not think that criminal at all.

3251 2019-05-17 19:26:23 U.S stocks gains after @POTUS extended 180 days a final decision on whether to impose broad tariffs on cars from Japan  and European Union  citing national-security concerns
3252 2019-05-17 19:26:18 They have had a series of technical events that pushed the price down way below reasonable value- funding needs, equity PP, pricing of conversion if debt below market, all of which are now out of the way. Even getting to even on their recent PP would be a huge gain from here.
3253 2019-05-17 19:25:31 You bought the lie. If you own $tsla stock, you’ll probably want to review the class action suits that will be coming. Unlike many of those for other stocks, I’d say there is a case here that material misstatements were and continue to be made.
3254 2019-05-17 19:25:12 Sometimes stocks fall for good reason.
3255 2019-05-17 19:25:08 I've been sleeping on my stocks

3260 2019-05-17 19:22:46 He sure knows how to dumb and pump stocks
3261 2019-05-17 19:22:20 this means watching while someone else fucks his stocks. which. uh, er...?
3262 2019-05-17 19:22:06 This guy really said “stop cucking my healthcare stocks” lmao
3263 2019-05-17 19:21:56 I dont think its known how many shares are pledged but when they raised capital I think Tesla said Elon had borrowed 500 million or so which was less than most thought. 500 million is really not that much compared to his stocks so cant he just pledge more?
3264 2019-05-17 19:21:31 'cucking my healthcare stocks'?

And btw, using outcomes as a measure, we are not the 'best in the world.'

3271 2019-05-17 19:18:00 In the stocks what goes down must come up eventually as trends over many years show growth for tye long term.

3277 2019-05-17 19:16:36 Stocks lower as the country mourns Grumpy Cat.
3278 2019-05-17 19:16:04 Hey many honestly curious why do you think the opportunity is so great on Uranium stocks?  Does it have to do with the future of the nuclear energy industry or does it have more to do with the fact they're at attractive price points right now? Thanks!
3279 2019-05-17 19:16:01 Correction:  Jan-April stocks rise on Fed put and the expectation of lowered Fed Funds and eventual QE - May: stocks fall on growing realization that lower rates and more money printing might not help (See Von Mises to understand why). The "trade war" is whore lipstick
3280 2019-05-17 19:15:23 Given how low the aviation related war stocks of our allies are, they are gonna be leaning much more heavily on our air and naval assets than our ground assets.  Those are the ones we should have on hand, not the first and third biggest armies in NATO.
3281 2019-05-17 19:15:15 Time to study stocks!
3282 2019-05-17 19:15:05 Yea, he brought us out the great Bush recession, gave health care for pre existing and health ins could be saved between jobs. Stocks gained greatly and jobs created and jobless rate from over 10 to 4.6 percent. Admit u r racist
3283 2019-05-17 19:15:01 FYI @CNBC a -10% dip in BTC is not a tailspin. Do your research. We have had much bigger drops than this and BTC always comes roaring back. Please stop reporting on BTC and stay in your lane with your Oil, Stocks and Bonds. Thanks. We are all Satoshi.
3284 2019-05-17 19:14:35 @cnbc had @blackrock Larry Fink on tv on April 16, 2019, claiming stocks could meltup, as if they hadn't melted up at record highs yet. The whole time China tariffs were advertised as very bad for stocks, by guests of cnbc & @markets, all who work for trading/wall st firms...
3285 2019-05-17 19:13:58 I talked to the rep that stocks.
3286 2019-05-17 19:13:51 Not all businesses but I can see why the fishing industry would want one. I know a lot of Irish fishermen are not happy with huge Spanish trawlers fishing in Irish waters taking what they see as their fish stocks and livelihood.
3287 2019-05-17 19:12:55 #fintwit OK, we’ve all seen “Stocks Dip on Trade Woes” and “Stocks Soar on Trade Optimism.”

A Bloomberg headline now splits the difference:
“Stocks Fluctuate on Mixed Trade Signals.”

I guess the headline-writers can now be laid off.

3297 2019-05-17 19:10:47 FED Funds also seen mispriced by some Fed heads.  Not a good way to end the week.  Why are stocks rallying everyday?  We need to reprice a longer term trade war.  Trump is thinking longer term cuz voters seem to like this...

3300 2019-05-17 19:10:15 @LizClaman  Why do you think steel stocks would rise after are tariffs removed? The opposite makes sense since tariffs were protecting the U.S steel producers !
3301 2019-05-17 19:09:51 If your healthcare stocks are in danger of being "cucked," they must be diverting their "reinvestments" towards dividends.

3312 2019-05-17 19:06:08 Maybe 2 months. I started end of March. And I been trading now. Got lucky on some but so far I had a couple of bad trades lately. But I still study and watch the stocks every day. Our learning process doesn't stop.
3313 2019-05-17 19:05:35 I plan on retiring in my 30s so i already know I’m not going see my full amount, I look at it as side change I can have once I’m done working. I got money in that and stocks. Lowkey been thinking about closing my account and make that shoe box money
3314 2019-05-17 19:05:34 Clear thinking! Those profits on your virile healthcare stocks can only be coming from patients getting really affordable treatment!
3315 2019-05-17 19:05:32 "stop cucking my healthcare stocks" is like "hootie hoo" for an incel party
3316 2019-05-17 19:05:07 I urge local investors to start buying Stocks on PSX as they are low in price now, good time to invest for long term. This is exactly what world's best investor Warren Buffet does.

3321 2019-05-17 19:03:55 They only want children to make it to 18 so they can send them into the war of their own making. To fund the bullet and firearm stocks so they become even more wealthy. After 18 good fucking luck with life and PTSD I guess...
3322 2019-05-17 19:03:26 Cya stocks adios
3323 2019-05-17 19:03:23 I think "get you in get you out" is the definition of cucking Healthcare Stocks.
3324 2019-05-17 19:03:14 take my healthcare stocks! please!!
3325 2019-05-17 19:03:07 Stocks

3328 2019-05-17 19:02:54 I guess that would depend if you own a home or a vehicle or had stocks or a 401k or life insurance or etc...  basically, how responsible were you as a parent.

3339 2019-05-17 19:00:33 Won’t someone please think of THE STOCKS?!?
3340 2019-05-17 19:00:25 Simply bigger allocations into more defensive stocks like $XLU or $XLP. In the #EM universe the $EEMV sounds like a good alternative to $EEM or $VWO to protect downside risk.
3341 2019-05-17 18:59:53 Stocks have bounced back after a drop at the open. But Deere still down on weak outlook. I'll be talking about markets and $DE with @ZainAsher on @cnni around 3:06 ET.

3344 2019-05-17 18:58:08 Yeah not everywhere stocks them sadly. Tesco q often do.  I like it when you get a cracker selection box and it includes Hovis, they're gorgeous with cheese.
3345 2019-05-17 18:57:55 Healthcare and stocks should be illegal to put next to each other in a sentence like that.

If you make your money off of people's suffering like that you're a pretty despicable person.
3346 2019-05-17 18:57:55 All to influence the market with it's biggest stocks to keep trying to push it higher... for greed

3350 2019-05-17 18:56:33 Everyone knows that once you buy a stock you have to keep it forever. No tradesies! And by law you have to profit from that stock with zero thought about changing market forces. It's why my steam engine stocks are still paying off such huge dividends.

1) Auto stocks trade at book value
2) Tesla's book value is $25
3) This stock has 90% downside
Tesla should trade at a big discount to book value due to its alarmingly weak balance sheet, massively negative ROE, and rapidly deteriorating fundamentals

3480 2019-05-17 17:53:23 Yeah that's usually how it goes let me do some research though. some times the summer months are bad for buying stocks compared to the fall. Thanks for the tip though 
3481 2019-05-17 17:53:12 CNBC is leading the lambs to slaughter. I wish they would discuss the reality of market conditions rather telling everyone that stocks are cheap. Too much conflict of interest with the talking heads.

3512 2019-05-17 17:32:59 I have the view that most stocks are not priced correctly.   It’s why they always move in price.   How is any of the market pricing in the geopolitical risks, economic risks, the risk of A Trump impeachment.  The market is looking at only interest rates.   But Tesla is Cheap.
3513 2019-05-17 17:32:36 Also shows how trickle down economics is bullshit. Instead of using profits to increase wages for their workers, they are buying back their stocks and keeping it within the higher-ups in their companies.

3515 2019-05-17 17:32:21 Yeah several. But for most tech IPOs, there's a 3 month window period you wait to buy after the IPO. Most times by then, the stocks have underperformed.

3525 2019-05-17 17:26:55 The secret to long term retirement investing (in my humble opinion) is to own stocks or funds with low drawdowns.
The less you notice an investment the better and the easier to hold long term as we as investors tend to notice big losses more than big wins.
3526 2019-05-17 17:25:02 Which is better international stocks or low Rick state side stocks?

3530 2019-05-17 17:23:09 A stock is not a company. The bigger the disconnect between the stock and company. The more the opportunity for a patient investors. Most stocks are priced correctly. But many are not. That’s where opportunities lie.

3556 2019-05-17 17:12:54 Value investing is very misunderstood, it has nothing to do with valuation metrics its simply buying stocks that were irrationally sold off at a price much lower than intrinsic value.
A good example was buying $ANTM $UNH after Sanders rhetoric hit healthcare stocks last month.

3589 2019-05-17 16:57:47 The way I understood this chart is that value stocks by definition trade at a discount with regard to the market and:

3603 2019-05-17 16:51:05 No reason to get hyped. It is already back down to 22 and change. Put your money in $SBUX and $ICE they are climbing in the midst of political uncertainty. #stocks #StocksToTrade #stockstowatch

PLEASE ask the Najarians to STOP pumping stocks that are 'already big gainers' and pick DOWN stocks that are seeing heavy call buying for a change. ALPHA!

3613 2019-05-17 16:48:23 It was "rigged by the Fed" last year, too. Didn't stop a 10% decline earlier in the year, followed by a 20% decline later in the year. 

Every cycle there's a reason that stocks will "never go down again!", and this cycle's reason is "the Fed!"
3614 2019-05-17 16:48:19 EXACTLY. And it’s sad because there’s thousands of stocks and many sectors. That’s what they should be talking about. Not just same 8 every day year after year day after day. Again. It’s what they own and they are pumping it. It’s sad because I like Pete bad jon and most.

3657 2019-05-17 16:36:12 ..The prices of some stocks or market indexes can be highly volatile; unpredictable and have swings which make them a more risky investment. The higher the volatility, the more risk it has, the lower the volatility the less risk it has. #journeytowealth

3733 2019-05-17 16:09:16 Hey Braden! Unfortunately, the process of stock settlement is not up to us. Stock settlement is the process of transferring stocks and cash between a buyer and seller after a trade is made, and for stocks this process takes T+2 days.
3734 2019-05-17 16:08:57 Longer than that during which you got two biggest declines of the last 15 months. And stocks have not recovered, and I seriously doubt they will irrespective of the coming elections. Save this tweet.

I'm not so sure on the altruism, other than paying more in taxes & having my stock accts less stable, i've not been hurt by djt personally. I knew he was bad long before the taxes & unstable stocks.

3741 2019-05-17 16:06:49 Stocks stilll nervous but US stocks move lower after European markets close
3742 2019-05-17 16:06:43 Certainly not, but buying stocks while you are young and holding them might work out nicely a few decades after graduation.  Better than blowing it on something you think you need at the time.

3749 2019-05-17 16:05:22 Comex vaults are not important.  All other commodities traded on exchange with or without exchange stocks. Copper, oil, grains, coffee. There will be a seller at a right price if or when price goes up.

Tell me what other stocks you own?
3755 2019-05-17 16:04:01 Let me ask you an honest question and this is not personal, but exactly which companies and their stocks have you had success with?
3756 2019-05-17 16:03:49 Haha nice to have you back those were AR-15s with  bump stocks. Those aren’t assault rifles
3757 2019-05-17 16:03:36 I passed my Series 7 Exam! I can now officially & legally sell stocks, bonds & any other investments in the US 
3758 2019-05-17 16:03:30 Yes crypto will be similar, but many Uranium stocks are essentially at their cycle lows right now. Akin to BTC at 3k if the bottom is in. Just the most optimal time to buy.
3759 2019-05-17 16:02:22 But not surprising when such movements are bankrolled and pushed by wealthy elites, banks, and corporations, the very entities ordinary people own stocks in or have 401k plans. So I guess we all have some responsibility to bear. My advice, don't invest in corporations. Use coops.

3770 2019-05-17 15:55:37 Some say index funds are a threat to the market. I say the opposite. Actively managed funds over-trade with each other while index funds buy and hold the same stocks long-term. The shift in investor preference from rent-it to buy-it doesn't hurt the markets - it helps investors.

If you check daily you’ll be perpetually stressed or annoyed, if you just leave it be and check back in a couple of years you might be pleasantly surprised, without the daily roller coaster of emotions.

3821 2019-05-17 15:32:18 You could be right. At the same time, there's a good argument to be made that a true breakdown in talks will cause a big hit to equity valuations. And the pessimism being baked into bond markets doesn't totally cohere with the resilience seen in stocks.

3856 2019-05-17 15:14:09 If u find that u agree about the market & #trading #stocks with a whole group of other people, & you're all in 'agreement' on what is considered right & wrong, then you've got serious problems. That's 'the crowd' u are meeting. RUN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION!
3857 2019-05-17 15:14:08 I do every day on Twitter! It's quite easy to figure out my positions I think. But don't want to make it too easy for people feeding on canned foods in their mom's basement & trading stocks off Yahoo chat rooms
3858 2019-05-17 15:14:02 When there is an economic shock a huge percentage of the stocks that go down do not recover. As I said you only have to watch sterling for the truth. As for real estate values in Swindon. Honda may leave them flat temporarily as will other economic factors but they've not fallen.

3865 2019-05-17 15:11:45 It is. I will find myself hoping to find that one friend in a coffee shop or bar that just wants to talk stocks. Other than that I end up talking about her nails or how long she spends in the salon.  Just eye candy.
3866 2019-05-17 15:11:13 I really, really, really hate owning stocks.  It feels nasty and gross.

I wish land, ammunition, seeds, and silver were my only holdings. 

I know, I know, just shut up, okay?  Something’s wrong with me.  

I don’t care.

3875 2019-05-17 15:09:44 So disappointed that nobody around me stocks a laptop with decent specs.

3877 2019-05-17 15:08:29 I honestly think its inkling 2nd best grounded normal based on the fact that it can almost instantly punish a  quick dash in after inkling whiffs a smash. People sleep on the move's speed and priority and it can save stocks in the right conditions.
3878 2019-05-17 15:08:18 This is the primary reason why there is such a big wealth disparity. Cash the primary asset of those who are no wealthy. While stocks and housing go up with inflation, cash loses value.

3882 2019-05-17 15:06:43 Very "interesting" but US stock market does not care about statistics for long term investors who are 100% in US stocks at all times. Bad times blow over fairly quickly and resume march upward. Politicians have too much at stake to blow it.This is why gold is a dying relic in USA
3883 2019-05-17 15:06:41 Stocks turn positive on news that consumer sentiment is at a 15 year high.
3884 2019-05-17 15:06:28 "Stocks fall on trade worries early, but spend the rest of the day climbing the wall of worry!"
3885 2019-05-17 15:06:22 Dollar cost averaging on a regular basis and HODLing may likely outperform experienced traders over time. In stocks, if you bought at the highest point every year for 30 years, your eventual returns are almost as good as someone who bought at the lowest points. Time is your ally.

3888 2019-05-17 15:04:45 I don't know, Younger people are actually putting more and more into their 401k today than ever before and if they invest in T.ROWE price retirement funds, they should have most in growth stocks looking out to 2050 and beyond. Troweprice is just stupid.
3889 2019-05-17 15:03:42 The Corbyn/McDonald Plan is to unnerve the Stocks of listed companies, knock down the value to ‘cheapen’ the price. However, many pensions rely on high values & it’s they who count the true cost of Communism.

3899 2019-05-17 14:58:12 IMO it will be more of a panic, at least in the VC community. These are momo stocks and they can go the other way on loss of faith, could be worsened by a crazy rush to get the junk off the books.

The man is insane.
3905 2019-05-17 14:55:10 So the cross party 'talks' (anyone else imagine a lot of games of hearts?) are over, and Brexit is restarted with the possibility of a no deal somehow right back on the cards - just when we have nearly finished all our March no deal stocks and hoarded essential prescriptions!
3906 2019-05-17 14:55:07 Beyoncé performed for Uber in 2015. Instead of accepting her $6M pay cheque, she requested to be paid in stocks. Today her stocks are worth over $300M. Bey took half of the $8M Coachella offered her in exchange for the rights to the show...Netflix paid her $60M for it.

3916 2019-05-17 14:51:10 Well you shouldn't ever panic-sell your stocks. I do think the CW is a bit blase about the threat. As Brad Setser notes, China could respond to tariffs with depreciation, which tends to eff with global markets. And deterioration in US-China relations is scary.

3947 2019-05-17 14:34:47 Happy Friday all! $SPY and $QQQ is back above 8ema, but $IWM is not. $IWM continues to be weak. On weekly chart one can see IWM weakness longer-term. It never regained August 2018 highs. Thinking this is a continuation a repricing of individual stocks based on China tariffs.
3948 2019-05-17 14:34:41 I have to agree, short all stocks. Assuming it's a random 50/50, basically every major company will lose half their board and C level employees, and that will devastate their stock prices.

It’s either bid chasers not having a clue what they’re doing chasing down and up or this is one example of many stocks being manipulated by the market lately.

4147 2019-05-17 13:09:15 Stocks are up because investors know that Donald will cave big time to China. They have had more than 2 years of experience with the Loser-in-Chief. Those fake bones spurs will always brand lmpotus as a coward. Business failures will always brand him as a loser. Bet against him.
4148 2019-05-17 13:08:58 They will ship more jobs to China for bigger profits, use that juicy tax cut to buyback stocks to drive up the valve their own stock options to self profit.  Stop giving corporations bigger & bigger handouts for smaller amounts of jobs and wages. It's a corporate culture sickness

4201 2019-05-17 12:41:40 The situation is perverse, because even negative news like trade wars are positive to stocks, because bad news imply more stimuli.

4229 2019-05-17 12:27:48 Flynn was working on deal with Russia to bring nuclear to Saudis. Nunes no doubt has financial ties in the deal. As always, follow the money.

4241 2019-05-17 12:22:16 Except that in the medium to long run GDP matters. It's real dollars to everyone in the economy. Most Americans don't even own stocks. The stakes are vastly higher for China.

4254 2019-05-17 12:14:04 for traders wondering what to look for in premarket action to pick top watches for the morning session, they should always watch relative strength and weakness. What for stocks that "dont want to come down any more" or vice versa even when the market continues down.
4255 2019-05-17 12:12:50 Stocks would be lower if companies didn’t increase economics on a per share basis by returning cash to owners. Face meet palm.
4256 2019-05-17 12:11:36 Will the Fed end up buying stocks?
4257 2019-05-17 12:11:10 @SunderjiJB Kindly Sir share  What is the good TF to spot patterns in stocks as per your observation & do you look for same pattern in every stock or each one has different characteristics if so how to backtest them.
4258 2019-05-17 12:10:49 I disagree with this. If those companies kept cash instead of buybacks I think stocks would be higher. How many companies have wasted money buying back stock at the top? That’s inefficient use of capital ex- NVDA buybacks > 200
4259 2019-05-17 12:10:26 stocks are more stable. That's coming from a crypto guy haha
4260 2019-05-17 12:09:26 You do realize one of three things happen, right?
1. Desired (prices rise, fall and stabalize through a new trade deal)
2. Undesired (prices rise and stocks fall hurting both of our economies) 
3. Things stay the same with America providing more goods and services at -630 billion
4261 2019-05-17 12:09:25 On your side here, however that’s not entirely true. In fact it’s only true about bitcoin. Other currencies are pre-mined or have non-profits (  ) behind them. Some are also holding a reserve and could easily influence value, just like stocks.

4286 2019-05-17 11:51:40 Thanks for that Rick.  

The question regarding Magic Fridays is of course, is the Fed and/or Treasury in there pumping up stocks or not? It would be insane for them to do it, but that's precisely why I suspect it happens.

4374 2019-05-17 10:48:18 Point being, that historically, fixed income securities thrive and stocks decline during a rising interest rate period.

4410 2019-05-17 10:19:40 Well, for eg, they seem to think they want "more control". I doubt they *really* want to spend more time discussing tariff quotas & fish stocks so perhaps they mean our MPs should decide such matters. But Brexit will give our MPS *less* leverage in the relevant domains not more.

4469 2019-05-17 09:31:43 I get ur point. What exactly is “pay to borrow”? Does it mean covering my short or am I “paying to borrow” the stocks at that prevailing market price.
4470 2019-05-17 09:31:24 C'est juste le temps de finir les stocks !

4471 2019-05-17 09:30:24 1. Our little local hardware shop stocks a huge range.

2. Confirmation bias: you remember all the times they annoyingly turned inside-out but forget the occasions when they stay the right way round. (Also, because you didn't do them up.)
4472 2019-05-17 09:30:23 And when, exactly, has he signed any legislation or EO that abrogates #2A Rights beyond bump stocks?
(They were, as I said, not legal under the NFA, so not sure why the ATF approved the patent and sale...)
4473 2019-05-17 09:29:43 U stocks still crap as they're making no money.  That is the simplicity.
4474 2019-05-17 09:26:41 Among the 50 stocks in the Nifty index, 31 were trading in the green, while 19 were in the red.

4479 2019-05-17 09:23:34 Don't think so. Stocks & exchange rate are barometers of economy’s perception which can't be misread by investors for long. Strong macroeconomic indicators & stocks+ER have to go hand in hand. Govt provided conducive policy env, which unfortunately this govt has failed miserably.
4480 2019-05-17 09:23:24 We should be in disbelief phase by now. Last cycle of gold also took 22 years, so stocks will end the bull market soon as well (next few years). Crypto cycles are just a lot quicker :)

4501 2019-05-17 09:03:06 My public high school mandated all students take a semester-long personal finance class prior to graduation.  It covered household budgeting, types of bank accts, credit/debt, & types of insurance.  It didn't cover retirement, stocks, or bonds.  He's making faulty *assumptions*.
4502 2019-05-17 09:03:06 I’ve seen niggas wash trap $$ in royalty statements, stocks/investments & pay bills. It’s true all $$ ain’t good $$ but it’s what you do with it all... that’s what really counts.

4514 2019-05-17 08:56:20 Agreed. But on LSE/AIM you often can still buy cheap stock after discovery. London market is slow in recognizing it and paying 40% more for confirmed discovery (with assays) is better for some people than taking risk before. On TSXV stocks move much quicker after big discovery
4515 2019-05-17 08:55:15 Stocks which witnessed selling:

Few of the stocks in the list were a part of CPSE ETF, which may have witnessed selling due to redemption in ETF, said the report.

4522 2019-05-17 08:47:46 $MATIC is currently trading 200 sats (top of the day) from 49 sats (since the bull took over). I learned from trading penny stocks,300% gain is toppish. And it is already at 400%. It is very risky to enter at this point for a small upside. But this is crypto, so who knows?

4582 2019-05-17 07:57:39 A very good question. It is possible that the decision was made when stocks positions were less certain and they wanted to sure up supply in a worst case scenario. That said the decision to approve the import should have been made on current information. Need to ask Manildra.

4611 2019-05-17 07:32:01 SOV has special meaning. If bonds are SOV then company stocks, real estate, anything you hope you can sell is a SOV. But then the SOV loses its meaning. Money is a SOV. People who hold money don't have any expectation of a yield, just liquidity.

4627 2019-05-17 07:19:11 Zero. You just keep putting up fake quotes and screenshots. Slavery and abortion are far more complex than this. Slavery was about REMOVING choice and the Black women used as breeding stocks had no choice so on that level your comparison is weak. Not having a choice is control.

 Stocks in General:

 The p/e ratio. Is it high or low for this particular company & for similar companies in the same industry.

 The percentage of Institutional ownership.The lower the better.
4635 2019-05-17 07:12:56 You feel a stock you hold is too costly, sell it. You feel the stock you like is cheap, buy it. As simple as that. Do not overcomplicate stock picking based on all the expert 'one-liners' that go around #stocks #Markets
4636 2019-05-17 07:12:43 Something is going on in China well beyond trade. Shan index is now at a level it was at in 2007. It dropped to lows than rose into 2015 on all that stimi and sold down since 2015 while world stocks rose. China is true on the data while US is a lie.

4669 2019-05-17 06:52:28 Not all are winners... if half the stocks u hold end up 10x & the other half extinct ,portfolio would be 4x & the CAGR is still 15%  post a 2% annual fee.. I would still feel making 12% PA from a Index fund safer. Very little changes of going BUST.

I generally don't bother trying to find high dividend stocks. 

That said, dividends are extremely important. 

Say u buy a 200 Rs stock, where dividend is Rs 2. When it hits 2000, the 1% yield gets u Rs 20.

On the initial base of Rs 200, it's 10%!!

That's a STEAL!

5002 2019-05-17 02:15:13 For sure: the toughest battle is the mental one when corrections and drawdowns take place.  Great growth stocks can often correct by 50% or more, multiple times, during decade long runs.

5067 2019-05-17 01:23:35 More than likely they all own big Pharma stocks. What happened to their bosses promise to lower them..
5068 2019-05-17 01:23:28 Is this bullish for stocks or not? I always hear it's not cuz stocks are priced in USD but if this usd is going up wouldn't that make the value of everything priced in USD go up? 
5069 2019-05-17 01:23:23 Well, although I do consider Lance a good friend here on Twitter I can't say that we've ever had a night out unless DMing about stocks counts I called him Sir this morning to be facetious and use a gender specific term and that was the reason for the wink

5073 2019-05-17 01:19:06 although it is a microscopic start ... Trump put a ban on bump stocks ... but a microscopic start is better than the "no start at all", given by Bush and Obama

5077 2019-05-17 01:15:07 SITUATION AT PSX IS A MATTER OF GREAT ANXIETY CONTINUED SLIDE OF STOCKS INDEX 52,000 TO CURRENT LOWEST 33000 DUE TO LACK OF DIRECTION & UNEVEN FISCAL POLICY OF THE GOVERNMENT. MOST FOREIGN INVESTERS WITHDRAWN, LOCALS SHYED AWAY EVEN FROM BLUE CHIPS. ATTENTION CALLED TO RECTIFY.
5078 2019-05-17 01:14:34 Not really a good idea to invest in penny stocks
5079 2019-05-17 01:14:32 In the end, I can work up optimism for his offensive game and figure out a scheme with which he'll succeed. What worries me more is his defense and how his frame translates to that end. The stocks% notwithstanding, he really feels like a guy who's going to be hunted on switches.
5080 2019-05-17 01:14:01 Even though the Biotech sector got knocked back hard since early April (see $IBB, $XBI, $BBH), I wonder if a comeback is in store.  In the last several days, the Biotech stocks in the list of stocks I track have been performing comparatively well as a group.
(Part 1 of 2...)
5081 2019-05-17 01:13:34 Different characteristics.  Physical in your position is the safest investment in the world.  Better than fiat cash in my opinion. Gold mining stocks provide leverage up and down to the gold price.  But with significantly more risk.  Mining is a tough business.
5082 2019-05-17 01:12:12 So billion of debt is a plan. letting your buddies profit off Infrastructure projects is a plan. Watch the stocks drop in your company when you are out of power

5107 2019-05-17 00:49:08 European stocks rose on Thursday as M&A activity offset concerns over the US-China trade conflict.
5108 2019-05-17 00:48:05 what's the narrative for stocks to climb further .    I think I missed it lol
5109 2019-05-17 00:47:58 stocks brodie
5110 2019-05-17 00:47:16 US stocks rose on Thursday, boosted by blue-chip results, economic data that highlighted the good health of the world’s largest economy and gains in banks as bond yields firmed.
5111 2019-05-17 00:46:52 Saw a story about @BeyondMeat  and how they are offering a plant based meat option at fast food places now. I eat meat but want a better option. So I bought 2 #Stocks in the company.. :-) $BYND
5112 2019-05-17 00:45:45 Yeah and then we ripped today. Mkts move around but we r darn near all time highs. Investing in stocks is my job. Farmer income has been hurt, true. Overall mkt doing very well.
5113 2019-05-17 00:44:42 You should look into linking CEO pay to average worker pay. Keep stock buybacks and keep the incentive for CEOs to boost stock prices, but create a bridge that automatically increases worker pay as stocks and executive bonuses go up.
5114 2019-05-17 00:42:46 I don't like Friday on the #ASX as few stocks move and people sell
5115 2019-05-17 00:41:12 i like the idea that its part of Trumps master plan to get re-elected - hold out on China, slump the stocks - take a 1% hit on GDP then swoop in and save the day with a Fed cut and a trade deal - stock market to recover to new highs - Economy to roar back. He's crazy like that
5116 2019-05-17 00:40:20 whats the next great stock?
5117 2019-05-17 00:38:59 How tf did i lose 3 stocks to kirby when kirby had JUST ONE WTF HOW

5125 2019-05-17 00:30:05 J'ai refait les stocks d'images flippantes jsens que je vais bien rigoler
5126 2019-05-17 00:26:40 You're right. Trump is yet again making money for his rich peeps. Not only did he tank the Soy bean market, Russia is now growing soy beans for China. Markets sway on his words, his rich friends by in the turmoil. This is a man who bought stocks then spread rumors and made 60 mil

5129 2019-05-17 00:20:34 Just had the conversation with a friend if he should buy his first #stocks now or later.

I honestly think everyone should buy a stock of their favorite company tomorrow!
5130 2019-05-17 00:20:19 Inflation means that as soon as you get money you need to buy something to keep its value before it's eroded (the value then going to the inflater). The hotter the inflation, the faster you have to do this. We do this in savings accounts (not good protection), CDs, bonds, stocks.
5131 2019-05-17 00:19:12 Not if it makes me money. I was flat lining on “great value stocks”  with P/E’s below 15 and kept watching growth stks explode higher. I’m in this thing for ONE REASON. To make money.   BOTTOM LINE
5132 2019-05-17 00:15:08 What's your questions about #trading? Shoot them my way, and I'd be glad to answer anything you want answered #stocks $AAPL $FB $NFLX $AMZN $GOOGL #QandA
5133 2019-05-17 00:14:57 Gregory, another informative PMWU. Question. If there is a full scale war won`t markets crash? Taking Oil & Oil Stocks down with it? At least for a short time? Precious metals normally spike too right? : ]
5134 2019-05-17 00:14:07 Yes, the IRS is watching.
But members of Congress can never be found guilty of Insider Trading. They have the power, authority, and knowledge to move entire industries & markets, and they're ALLOWED to buy & sell stocks with that info that none of the rest of us have access to.
5135 2019-05-17 00:13:43 news dosent matter anymore in stocks or crypto lol. Its a fake market until it completely collapses in a couple years.
5136 2019-05-17 00:13:25 @realDonaldTrump You fucking piece of shit dried up old hot pocket... who are you to have opinion on why fashion stocks are suffering you wish one of your shitty businesses/brands would of ever had success like @VictoriasSecret? Worry about your own god damn issues #FreeTaxForms
5137 2019-05-17 00:12:44 That's true, in a narrow sense as I compare art to stocks, an Art has given less than a Stock Index. But ofcourse the billionaires know better!
5138 2019-05-17 00:12:10 Hey Pot Stocks(@stocks_pot), thank you for following me
5139 2019-05-17 00:11:49 Interesting what's selectively reported for #markets and #stocks in times of volatility. e.g. $AMAT beats analysts forecast!!
5140 2019-05-17 00:10:27 How you find penny stocks ?
5141 2019-05-17 00:10:06 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
5142 2019-05-17 00:09:30 Well, when they come on TV and give "advice" they should have to disclose who they are paid by, just like stock mkt pundits have to disclose their positions, or not hold any stocks at all.
5143 2019-05-17 00:04:56 stocks on my "concerned list" have dwindled from 20+ to 3...in two days. Powerful market $SPX $COMPQ
5144 2019-05-17 00:04:44 Something you learn that isn't necessarily taught:

Stocks usually go up on lower volume than they go down on. This isn't a red flag, it is the standard way prices move. People panic quickly (sell volume all at once) and regain confidence slowly (buy volume over time).
5145 2019-05-17 00:01:29 Theoretically. However, I bet if programed to some form of hype stocks (OSTK etc) and set at X percent of a pf to run on the side, it would add alpha. I am thinking CGC 'breakout' at 50+ last year that instantly failed to 25 etc.
