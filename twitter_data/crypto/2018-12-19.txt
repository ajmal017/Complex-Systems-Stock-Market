40 2018-12-19 23:55:50 The worst thing about this is lack of education on “assets” this is crypto’s biggest challenge of the next few years. ZRX is not something I would consider an asset.

70 2018-12-19 23:50:42 i can probably write one end of the week and upload. From there we will have mass adoption. Should long BTC now :)
71 2018-12-19 23:50:38 No issues... I transferred over a small amount to my tronlink address first, swapped that to make sure everything worked, and it was really smooth.  Don't think the trc20 can be traded right now, but the trc-10 can still be traded (if you want to accumulate)  and swapped over.
72 2018-12-19 23:50:29 non crypto friend, over text: @kobebryant is speaking at the Tron $TRX conference! is Tron gonna tokenize the NBA?! can you get me a ticket?! should i buy Tron?!? ANSWER ME!!!

119 2018-12-19 23:43:12 there is always space enough for a stop gain, there is no need to be hugely trending markets.
of course that a strategy desgined like this is trend-following at his best 
but the better trades are always on trend following markets.
trading range is about little profits + keep cap

146 2018-12-19 23:39:54 probably shouldnt believe everything you google. There are individuals who have looked at the location of his funds on the XRP ledger, the multi-sig release of them and the subsequent sales. 
Crypto articles are notoriously unreliable. as someone in industry you should know this.
147 2018-12-19 23:39:53 Do you see any future in Ethereum or are you ignoring crypto as a tradable asset altogether?

152 2018-12-19 23:39:23 No one is pulling their crypto from exchanges lol. Too many idiots

162 2018-12-19 23:38:39 It is possible and it is our only bearish count left IMO .
Just don't like how far BTC swung up
163 2018-12-19 23:38:38 +1 @xrptipbot extra tip for use of the word fuck.
164 2018-12-19 23:38:33 I would buy it with crypto, but very confused by "smallest bid wins" stuff.
165 2018-12-19 23:38:26 while I highly appreciate crypto in all forms, please note that vim uses its own implementation...

174 2018-12-19 23:37:15 Much confusion between cryptocurrencies and #crypto assets - everything is bundled together under the term ‘cryptocurrencies’ but for example #ethereum or #ether isn’t a currency. Important to educate

183 2018-12-19 23:36:25 21 million is a limit created by satoshi. An arbitrary limit. Plus, even miners admit that there's at least a century before the last coin is mined. By then, the fad would have died out.

Crypto is only "finite" in technical terms.

195 2018-12-19 23:35:30 Recommending hallucinogens as a fool-proof way to improve someone's life would be the equivalent of recommending they bet their life savings on a round of roulette as a fool-proof way to double their wealth.
196 2018-12-19 23:35:16 That's exactly what I said. There's a finite number of each crypto. Once you acquire them all (by mining or other means), that's it. An, no, BTC is not the only "common" coin. Ripple, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dash, etc.

208 2018-12-19 23:32:44 So its not just a regular trailing stop but more like a series of individual trade setups chained together in a way?
209 2018-12-19 23:32:42 @coinbase doesn’t see a dime of my business at this time because I buy all of my XRP direct from @uphold. I’m sure alot of people transfer between exchanges but I avoid it. Investors want simple solutions for buying crypto.

293 2018-12-19 23:21:55 Well if you held gold during the GFC then in terms of USD you ‘lost money’, but relative to say the Australian or Brazilian fiat you would have ‘made money’ since their currencies fell more than gold relative to the USD

Bitcoin built with value set
That's compatible with

Not so with Chinese or Russian sets

Crypto crashes on its own. USD doesn't crash on its own.
299 2018-12-19 23:21:26 its just another market bubble cycle, look at marijuana stocks rn and theyre the exact same as crypto last year. bitcoin goes through crazy growth cycles every 2-3 years. the next one will be demonic and the people that buy at the top are going to be so fucking broke
300 2018-12-19 23:21:04 So Why is it current customers problem what happened several months ago?

308 2018-12-19 23:20:09 How is this problem unique to fiat?  Just as a bank in such a foreign jurisdiction can take fiat deposits, a crypto-bank can hold crypto deposits for the customer. The only obstacle to this are those that keep crypto from becoming a real currency.

346 2018-12-19 23:16:23 *Sigh* that's what makes it better than fiat. Fiat currency generation is determined by politicians and bankers. They decide how much is printed and when. With crypto, no body decides anything. There's a finite amount of each. Once you run out, the existing coins increase value.
347 2018-12-19 23:16:22 #FREE
Bitcoin closed down 5% this week but this  drop did not affect the popularity of cryptos — the number of verified clients of exchanges and crypto services increased almost twofold in the nine months of 2018.(from 18 million to 35 million people in the current year).

356 2018-12-19 23:15:17 And if small/developing/commodity focused economies default(or are speculated to)on national debt then BTC could launch like during the Greek debt crisis as their local currency collapses(at least temporarily)due to capital flight out of the country and its fiat

439 2018-12-19 23:03:38 Hello Diana! Since we are not a crypto investment firm we do not invest in cryptocurrencies. Is this something you are interested in?
440 2018-12-19 23:03:35 ですねぇ。出来高のあまりの変動に違和感を覚えたのかもしれませんが、逆にあからさま過ぎて怪しくないというか。
441 2018-12-19 23:03:25 yes I can try
442 2018-12-19 23:03:24 I think the main thing deterring people from going full time $crypto is that no one pays you to go to the toilet any more.

If this was last year, someone would probably make an ICO for that.
443 2018-12-19 23:02:52 Define "interiorizar" e define "o que se passa".

Pá, para acompanhar o que se passa lá fora basta ler jornais estrangeiros. O FT publica coisas sobre crypto desde essa altura (pelo menos). O resto é só ter cabecinha para pensar e um browser para pesquisar.Será assim tão difícil?

468 2018-12-19 22:59:43 I didn’t (good call) but it’s not that. It’s literally now generating files with different header lines, no longer “BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY”, now “BEGIN PRIVATE OPENSSH KEY”. New files don’t seem compatible with node crypto. It’s new ssh-keygen behaviour.

470 2018-12-19 22:59:23 Because crypto twitter doesn't reflect the true feelings of the general public. CT are purists who are in it until 0 and therefore we have a skewed sense of perception
471 2018-12-19 22:59:22 Even with the Dow tanking 350 points today, the crypto market trended downward. It probably won’t move back up until Asia comes on line later today, which corroborates US market manipulation, as usual. The Asians are way ahead of us on cryptos. They get it !!!

484 2018-12-19 22:57:48 Hadn’t thought about miner liquidation as a potential negative.  Was assuming marginal miners are selling close to 100% at these prices. This and Bakkt lead me to think Jan will be the start of accumulation. That said I increased my $ETH by 10% in the $80’s.
485 2018-12-19 22:57:46 Some people who do a that don’t hit millions till 50, all the trading and investing is very hard and does require quite a bit of intellect and school def helps, crypto is always a gamble and unpredictable, etc. can’t really plan this stuff.

512 2018-12-19 22:54:43 It is realistic. My plan is to focus on investing. Learn how to invest in forex, crypto, then stocks and do it for 2 years. After that, get into real estate. Lastly, open my own business. This whole thing 5-8 years. Millionaire within that time.

The competition in crypto trading is that big that unless you sit on a big bank account you will have to charge fees in order to survive. Currently at the market only a few players are really profitable from trading fees only.

587 2018-12-19 22:44:46 @coinbase @brian_armstrong, it is a misleading statement. Coinbase is only bringing crypto-currencies like bitcoin in end users world, not the definitely not the blockchain tech!
588 2018-12-19 22:44:31 nice work! i would buy one
589 2018-12-19 22:44:31 I'm not getting into this discussion my lady
590 2018-12-19 22:44:26 Let me know when it hits $75k so I can buy in
591 2018-12-19 22:44:22 Cool nickname though.
592 2018-12-19 22:44:20 Has anyone ever nailed down why exactly XRP and Ripple seem to make her so combative? XRP is great tech, and Ripple is doing a huge amount of heavy lifting to get crypto assets legitimized. Everyone wins in that scenario, and yet..
593 2018-12-19 22:44:19 For most people very soon will sounds as still this year
594 2018-12-19 22:44:18 it's very good that imusify is the best cryptocurrency to invest in 2018 so let's take this opportunity

596 2018-12-19 22:44:15 I reckon they are still trading 3 apples for a coconut.  They are still miles away from signed promisary notes never mind gold standard backed fiat.  We are going to #blowtheirminds when we show them crypto.
597 2018-12-19 22:44:13 Everybody will use crypto for the rest of their lives. Everyone will swap tokens to use dApps and have their own digital assets. Everybody has to learn sometime. Call it democratising of trading if you want. I just call it using crypto.
598 2018-12-19 22:44:10 I thought you said USDC for a second there
599 2018-12-19 22:44:02 well 1.5 year is closing shortly :D also what is the purpose of a rowdmap and time stamps if all we hear when its ready it will be ready,that sound to me like Soon..This kind of talks are weak indeed :)

660 2018-12-19 22:37:11 It's not. As a Bitcoin maximalist I know Bitcoin is the sound money that all humans were waiting for. Bitcoin is here to end with Fiat. @ the same time on a different layer I can see how some projects can unlock swarm intelligence. Once bitcoin is adopted crypto is not a problem.

698 2018-12-19 22:31:04 The fact that you can "mine" crypto for free, given you have a gpu and electricity, says a lot about how invalid of a currency it is.

The fact that it's not produced, controlled, or regulated is proof of how illegitimate it is.

725 2018-12-19 22:28:25 It sounds like they mean just buying / selling crypto, not using it as a bridge currency for transferring fiat
726 2018-12-19 22:28:25 There's a difference between backing and investment, not that you'd know.

Wall Street has investors in crypto. Backing is recognition by governments that a currency is legitimate. So like I said, crypto has no backing.

732 2018-12-19 22:27:58 The prefix "crypto" means secret or hidden. It's just another made-up word to throw around as an insult in order to paint them as much as a bad person as possible. The same way they use "Neo-Nazi adjacent" or "gateways to the alt-right".
733 2018-12-19 22:27:46 @CNBCFastMoney
734 2018-12-19 22:27:41 I don't wanna answer that question, black SUVs will come out of nowhere.
735 2018-12-19 22:27:38 Behind every ask of, "Is XRP is a security?" there is typically a Bitcoin maximalist with a bone to pick and a red bag that isn't turning green often enough. I'm long BTC but not at the expense of the rest of the digital asset market. How about some crypto unity, people?

739 2018-12-19 22:27:02 I have been to #sixflags but I can definitely tell #crypto #trading is the better rollercoaster park
740 2018-12-19 22:26:43 Love that movie but it’s also terrifying
741 2018-12-19 22:26:42 If you truly love #crypto, you love it in a bull or a bear market. Gaining value is nice, but improving the future of the world is better.
742 2018-12-19 22:26:40 Do you have a strategy for deciding how far behind the trailing stop is from the price, or based on feel?
743 2018-12-19 22:26:13 Just tried to talk to the denarius guys about the cryptobridge misunderstanding
744 2018-12-19 22:26:04 A lot put words in others mouths nowadays. Can't even believe anyone anymore lol

749 2018-12-19 22:25:34 @buddendorf Je pinned tweets doen het niet. Wat zijn Crypto-Jews? Doen die iets met BTC?
750 2018-12-19 22:25:23 So you think because Sam was close to the truth he got suspended?

754 2018-12-19 22:25:10 Smart as a carrot? Never heard that.

I am sure @ltc_angel has other names for cucumbers 
755 2018-12-19 22:25:06 lol no.  Everyone leaving CA
756 2018-12-19 22:25:05 You're right. If they block my account Kichiro will turn on the ban hammer and ban Twitter from the internet. Or at least Europe.
757 2018-12-19 22:25:01 Oh, our Telegram bot is also protecting over 1 million crypto across 1,000 crypto communities too - for free. And then there is our integration with @coolwallet which is protecting 200,000+ customers - for free.
758 2018-12-19 22:24:59 not sure about Santa but apparently we could still do worse than crypto's 2018 performance as we are sinking while bitcoin is rebounding....
759 2018-12-19 22:24:53 I figured as much. Thanks for that feedback. I like the colour scheme in the rusty brown. Since you do not know what cryptocurrencies are (as painters) may I volunteer that having ever increasing numbers of ICOs does not create value out of thin air; it just dilutes existing cap.
760 2018-12-19 22:24:53 Haven’t bought any crypto besides $btc in the past few days. Not gonna fomo into rallies just yet either. Mad I didn’t buy waves at $1 when I wanted to buy in. Procrastinated on that one

799 2018-12-19 22:20:50 Unlike stocks markets which have a daily closing time, crypto is 24/7 so it's very arbitrary to have a daily candle at 00:00GMT
Today a daily close at 1pm would give a very different candle despite orders/trades/PA which is the data we should conclusions from, being the same, no?

817 2018-12-19 22:18:34 My fear is how many people9 Bitcoin, Altcoins to "crypto") are going to blunder and lose their supply. People really need to be stressing testing small amounts first and ensuring they know how to implement safe, recoverable storage. Could shade the movement and turn sour. imo
818 2018-12-19 22:18:22 Surprised the Crypto bros haven’t pivoted to 2K VC yet. @NBA2K
819 2018-12-19 22:18:14 Even the listing news of xrp doesnt cause a massive buy anymore. Last coin BAT just got dumped massively after coinbase listing. Forget coinbase: its trading volumes are irrelevant.

Not to self plug but our engine is benchmarking faster than Nasdaq and 10x faster than the bigger crypto exchanges so we’re designed not to have those issues. Integrity, consistency & responsiveness we have to build over time, can’t cheat that process
854 2018-12-19 22:15:01 I never said that. Divide and rule is a brilliant attack vector for no coiners (not the people who don't hold it but the ones who want to see it burn to ashes i.e. make all of crypto $BCC)

862 2018-12-19 22:13:49 So you're hedging a bet in the value of bit coin on the downfall of the American economy? That isn't going to happen anytime soon. I like the concept of crypto but it only works as a stable economy if we lived in a libertarian wet dream society, which is never going to happen.
863 2018-12-19 22:13:33 I bought the top and stayed around long enough to learn how to buy the bottom. I hope this past week was the bottom or I learned nothing lol.

871 2018-12-19 22:12:16 Crypto is going down to beanie baby status at some point.
872 2018-12-19 22:11:55 Learn. Adapt. Improve.
873 2018-12-19 22:11:53 I think it was a genuine response to ppl wanting reassurance. He didn't really solve much, he just gave us a little more insight to keep holding. I've read all of his comments when his sub was open and based on the linguistics, I'm almost certain this is the same person
874 2018-12-19 22:11:49 Would like it if you could better customize individual coin price notifications instead of just "significant moves since last opened." A scrolling selector by coin would be cool. Crypto moves >2% often with swings so the standard notifications are sometimes too much.
875 2018-12-19 22:11:48 Nothing has changed
876 2018-12-19 22:11:48 No need to make a big thing out of this, but i wont hesitate if he goes full @Nouriel
877 2018-12-19 22:11:43 I know I haven’t tweeted much lately #icecreamarmy. Been focused on some life stuff. But I really feel the obligation to tweet about the crypto “analyst” @RonnieMoas. He is basically a scam artist. Stay very far away. Sad to see these type of people in the community.
878 2018-12-19 22:11:38 Hahah i like it, however BAKKT I “believe” is only using BTC “to start”, once all kinks (if any) are worked out they will start losting Crypto’s that”everyone wants “according to their post.. i pray that TRX is eventually listed I will c u in KEY WEST on my trip around the world
879 2018-12-19 22:11:37 It seems some of the crypto influencers do have a price.

Bear market shows your true colors I guess
880 2018-12-19 22:11:33 I’d say that, and the consistency. Exchanges were a nightmare in Q4 2017.... CB included. Binance was by far the standout when no one else could handle the bandwidth and the parabolic frenzy. That’s huge. For me their investment into crypto succeeding as a whole is a big deal.

890 2018-12-19 22:10:41 my favorite are those who post after the top and bottom...they’re not even worried about the appearance of timing. only the gloating of having longed and shorted to to the exact high and low.
891 2018-12-19 22:10:24 You should tell him to reconsider blocking and deleting that

Nothing wrong with making mistakes predicting the future.

But hiding mistakes.... that's a deception i wont tolerate
892 2018-12-19 22:10:14 I'm implying that the American dollar becomes worthless if the American economy goes to shit. Crypto isn't reliant on a single country's economy. A fiat (like crypto) is only as valuable as people deem it. There's no inherent difference.

925 2018-12-19 22:07:47 Are you implying the American dollar does not have international value? People around the world have much more faith in fiat currency than they do crypto. Especially the American dollar. And the American dollar has the backing of a (semi) efficient government to stabilize it

Actually this altcoin rally is a bad omen for a sustainable crypto rebound.

930 2018-12-19 22:06:49 Have you used BTC? Money needs to be fast... BTC is pretty slow and just bad... any other crypto is better then BTC.  Besides, when we see 40 billion double spends that are coming to BTC, it will completely abandoned.....
931 2018-12-19 22:06:40 til it breaks thru the next resistance at a higher high etc all i am seeing so far is a bounce/bulltrap

hoping it gets there tho

976 2018-12-19 22:02:30 Any of these things (fiat currency, stocks, crypto) are as trustworthy as people believe them to be. They aren't actually any more or less stable than each other. Unlike fiat currency, crypto has international support, so one country's economy can't make it worthless.

990 2018-12-19 22:01:00 they would control it with no more certainty than any other currency, including crypto coins. If it is to be a global  currency, then it would have to work transparently in the same way everywhere.

1000 2018-12-19 22:00:26 I think we might wanna slow the role a tad. There aren't even very good on ramps into just crypto yet. Not sure an investor fleeing risk in equities sees crypto as a suitable hedge right now. Time will tell.
1001 2018-12-19 22:00:24 Damn and blast macOS Mojave!

1015 2018-12-19 21:59:46 The same, don't know something wrong
1016 2018-12-19 21:59:14 It's unstable, which has been completely proven. It's no more stable than a stock option and that's all people treat it like. Unlike a government regulated currency which is way more stable and trustworthy as a currency when compared to crypto currency.
1017 2018-12-19 21:59:09 For non-US residents I think.  The good ol "aml/kyc" excuse, that coincidentally happens as crypto liquidity evaporated.

1019 2018-12-19 21:58:59 Just finished setting up my $xtl @stellitecash wallet and miner. This is by far the easiest setup I've done and this is how we can get newbies into crypto mining. Keep up the good work.

1029 2018-12-19 21:57:42 One good thing about the wilting of crypto is that the consultancy requests that go nowhere and involve them hoping I will write something explaining how they are the future of money and freedom have dried up.

1038 2018-12-19 21:56:44 Pete’s a fantastic technical analyst. I sold my $HIVE the day that Bitcoins parabolic advance ended, which ended up being a massive top on crypto. I’m thankful to him for his insight.

1056 2018-12-19 21:55:34 Stock market drops = crypto market drops faster. Money from stocks will not flow into an even more volatile and risky asset class. People will be looking for safe havens.

1063 2018-12-19 21:54:32 Got a heavy bag of this. Accumulating every month.  then 
1064 2018-12-19 21:54:26 Why whats up
1065 2018-12-19 21:54:25 Encouraging debate and facilitating transparency seems daunting and even counter-productive but is actually a superpower which facilitates becoming anti-fragile

Many crypto projects stymie legitimate questions labelling it as FUD. Huge red flag run a mile. Short them if possible
1066 2018-12-19 21:54:25 It inching up a bit. But I don’t own any, so the crypto guys in here can better speak to that.
1067 2018-12-19 21:54:00 Dude I put a link somewhere on my twitter of this website. It was pretty good. Only thing I didn’t like was the fib ratios . But fib ratios will vary in each market. Also u know how they say wave 3 is typically the strongest. I would say 5 is the strongest in crypto
1068 2018-12-19 21:53:51 Stratı sattığını umuyorum
1069 2018-12-19 21:53:45 say it clear man, not all the world knows all of your sophistications.. just fucking say it clear. Who the fuck should be interested in being one year exactly?

1074 2018-12-19 21:53:08 What if that is what they want you to think? instead of 40% drop in 1-2 days they do it in a month to accumulate cheaper for longer? some were confident that the market had to reasons to go under 6k, specially not to 3,2k, so pretty sure that was the capitulation
1075 2018-12-19 21:52:58 any crypto without underlying physical assets backing it up is TRASH
1076 2018-12-19 21:52:56 So you are watching the daily open as a support area? If so, can you please explain why?
1077 2018-12-19 21:52:54 Take a look at what happened today in the #Crypto markets

1095 2018-12-19 21:51:33  if you were to invest $1k in crypto today what % should you put into $BTC vs $ETH?

1156 2018-12-19 21:44:09 Most likely rise up again imo. Too many people missed the bounce and are hoping it comes back down and as you know the market doesn't tend to do what everyone wants. Also those who shorted 3600-3800 are hoping to retest the low and may get liquidated allowing us to rise higher

1176 2018-12-19 21:41:00 Hi Hello the 2 brothers ! 
I don't want to promote ABRA and their BIT-10 currency. I only want to have your opinion about this 10 in 1 crypto.

Thank you. I appreciate each of your videos!

1180 2018-12-19 21:40:43 Crunch time! predict we will have a drop... then everyone's going to realise there's nowhere else to put their money = crypto possibly surge first quarter 2019 
1181 2018-12-19 21:40:38 You can ask, I already know how the industry works
1182 2018-12-19 21:40:33 I agree, but think it is ok for the masses to start with the basics.
Even though starting with 0x is not even the real basics like Bitcoin, Ethereum or what a blockchain actually is...
1183 2018-12-19 21:40:28 Then your beef is only because they list coins that pay the fees but a most likely scams? Cryptopia and coinexchange should be your target too! CB is far from perfect but I think you might try to find facts to fit your narrative.

1204 2018-12-19 21:37:32 I think a huge win for $XRP and the #XRPcommunity in 2019 is going to be a common understanding by news outlets that XRP is not Ripple's. This story that keeps getting told of it being Ripple's XRP is a road block, especially for those new to crypto. #educateyourself.

1240 2018-12-19 21:33:46 This is mainly what I think. But I also think how PayPal acquired Ebay. That couldn't happen in crypto. So we need to start from the ground up with similar concepts to Amazon, Alibaba and eBay in my opinion. Create new more popular blockchain marketplaces with advantages.
1241 2018-12-19 21:33:46 We’re all mad, that’s why we created our own space

I agree ...this next "bull market" will be very different from previous, it won't dump, it won't be organic retail, the whales will look like krill in the face of how institutional (very smart) money plays the asset accumulation game.

1271 2018-12-19 21:30:47 And not for nothing, Binance launched as an ICO that accepted BTC, ETH, and NEO as funds. They also famously claimed they would mine the GAS and give to it's customers. they did as claimed. I suspect they saw what the hottest alt was at the moment and used it to their advantage.

1286 2018-12-19 21:29:18 It's just hard to synchronize events more closely than a couple of seconds reliably. Spanner manages 7ms or so with gigantic effort. That's still 100k or so transactions of possible double spend in a high frequency trading system: not good enough for that kind of trade.
1287 2018-12-19 21:29:14 I for one NOT taking your own word that it's a common occurrence (otherwise the patent office would have been abolished) but all kind of crooks do all kind of things and many of them get burnt/crucified, this kind of thing (theft of designs) can be in their ass for long long time

1290 2018-12-19 21:29:11 Again, Ripple did not create $XRP.  As for adoption, planes didn’t overtake trains for quickest mode of transportation immediately after the Wright brothers took flight.  It took decades and two major wars.
1291 2018-12-19 21:29:03 I've been accepting crypto as a payment option for over a year now.

1295 2018-12-19 21:28:33 Alibaba, Amazon, Apple, Facebook or Ebay accepting either BTC or some new crypto (the one they created themselves maybe). This will produce trust, increase global usage by multiple factors and will lead to growth for the whole crypto space.
1296 2018-12-19 21:28:17 We need a much better user experience. Right now, even smart people struggle first time. And if the first one is a struggle, people will always choose the easy option the next time

I hear that NEX exchange have some tricks up there sleeve that makes user experience much better
1297 2018-12-19 21:28:06 Bittrex hit it's stride during Neo's early run...many sites didn't have antshares back then and after the ethereum pump from $15-$440, people were thinking of neo as the ethereum of China (ha! Oh 2017.) I recall neo having a 24 vol on bttrx @ ~40k or more btc volume.

1301 2018-12-19 21:27:53 No idea how to predict crypto. Can't call a bottom or a top can only ride the wave.  More interested in the second half of 2019 for crypto.

1309 2018-12-19 21:26:17 In which the original would have to prove. In fashion it’s not that “easy” as you’re trying to make it out to be? Otherwise this wouldn’t be a common occurrence in the industry

1312 2018-12-19 21:26:02 Great way of pushing crypto... Well done.. Keep it up 
1313 2018-12-19 21:25:56 Wow 1st , no need to be rude, I was never rude. It goes to show how professional you are. 2nd, I never said denarius is a shitty project, I just said that because cryptobridge have a lot of them on the exchange. Stop being so emotional in a discussion
1314 2018-12-19 21:25:49 Lines of support will be tested, you might capitulate at 750, but overall Bullish on you...
1315 2018-12-19 21:25:49 For starters, crypto would have to be as fast as paypal
1316 2018-12-19 21:25:44 "cutesy and wholesome" you know this chick is just tryna finesse crypto nerds outta their hard earned coins
1317 2018-12-19 21:25:43 Who one and then respectfully returned it to him. He could hardly see him. #twitterbot #crypto #cryptocurrency #bitcoin #ethereum
1318 2018-12-19 21:25:05 Wtf is a blockchain eco system ? Like sharks selling and sheeps buying tron js that what you mean your token coin is retarded it hasnt brought any value to crypto you support it for all the wrong reasons its a worthless pos.

1361 2018-12-19 21:21:19 I believe the advent of Stable Coins will support merchant and payment adoption of crypto to rival traditional assets and systems like PayPal. It will take time, the infrastructure is being built.
1362 2018-12-19 21:21:12 Hey @RubinReport @jordanbpeterson:

Have you guys considered talking to the famous @BrendanEich at @AttentionToken? He's revolutionizing online advertising and payments using crypto. Their browser has millions of users and they have thousands of YT channels signed up. 

Synergy!
1363 2018-12-19 21:21:03 Aren't they too preoccupied with crypto, now, anyway?

1367 2018-12-19 21:20:24 The market cap of Paypal is equal to the entire market cap of Crypto. Yet Paypal is just one entity. So we have to ask ourselves. How did this digital entity grow? I think PayPal, and websites accepting PayPal (mainly adoption) so what would it take for crypto to get there? 
1368 2018-12-19 21:20:21 Crypto really is up right now. I don’t think I see a correlation to what’s happening now with the US market . Hmm not reallyyy but it’s possibleeee ehh? $BTC

1451 2018-12-19 21:12:09 What about the broken scepter in the fire? This image was sent some days BEFORE the SWIFT CEO has announced to quit his job. Coincidence?

They will defend it and denial all truth at any price.

1473 2018-12-19 21:09:59 Binance is the only one I really trust. They've had a phenomenal track record of dealing with issues. Solid CS. But most importantly... They're actively involved in crypto and the continued progress of crypto. 
Coinbase is too "gov-frienndly" imo. I don't trust that.

1475 2018-12-19 21:09:37 If this was real education, they would mention that ZRX tokens serve no purpose now. Not that it did much before. 

 But I’m sure they didn’t. I think they’re trying to condition newbies to believe all crypto assets are “peer-to-peer” & “decentralized” same as Bitcoin.

1502 2018-12-19 21:07:01 SuppoCat says...KIN has already flirted with death, like many cryptocurrencies in 2018.

KIN on Coinbase would be positive news.

The day KIN can be used to buy products,services,homes&cars etc will be the day crypto has truly arrived.Let's hope KIN can be the most utilised coin.
1503 2018-12-19 21:06:59 Never said it cost them 0.5btc, but on an exchange that include so many different coins, you need to put a price that would stop every shitcoin to change ticker just for the sake of it otherwise you just end up working on trivial matter instead of real issues. 0.5btc cover that.

1507 2018-12-19 21:06:45 Just because you think it, does not make it true. Ask any credible exchange, crypto payment service, or bitcoin company, or even coin market cap. BitcoinSV is an instance of bitcoin, with its own rules, hash rate, blockchain etc.

1598 2018-12-19 20:56:51 Big love for @LBXSocial and their OTC desk. I've used them 10+ times now & they're a wonderful, quick & helpful group of people w/ excellent service. Buying or selling >£100k of crypto, theyre your best bet. Thanks a lot, especially to Greg. I don't even get paid for this tweet.
1599 2018-12-19 20:56:35 Would you have liked crypto market to have gone down slower too?

1623 2018-12-19 20:53:00 More like a sudden rush of cocky dumbasses playing the market. Happened in tech stocks, housing, crypto, etc. Not saying you're one of them but if you look at twitter, stocktwits, FB/Youtube ads.. there were many signs of Euphoria out there. Especially January 2018.

1661 2018-12-19 20:49:13 Three days ago people were waiting for sub 3k to buy #bitcoin. It went up 25% and today few are chasing it at 3700. In the near future lot of people will buy at +20k just before it drops again. Be greedy when other are fearful. #Crypto #btc #cryptocurrency #money
1662 2018-12-19 20:49:12 I apologize for gross oversimplification or if this thought is like Coase Theorum duh! But is legit Crypto/bitcoin essentiallly a hedge against or more accurately bet on the shrinking of American Hegemony?  At some point, does United Nations become involved as regulatory forum?

1671 2018-12-19 20:46:20 Thanks bro...Don't miss out on Cowrium. And it's not time to sell any of your crypto right now. it's time to buy. Don't fall a victim....smiles!
1672 2018-12-19 20:46:19 The math might work out differently long-term with PoW cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin/0xBTC, due to their fixed lifetime supply (21 million units) & deflationary properties. More can't be spontaneously printed (#inflation). Downside: I can't (yet) buy a pizza directly with crypto
1673 2018-12-19 20:46:16 I can't wait for @RobinhoodApp to add crypto to the platform!

1721 2018-12-19 20:41:12 It is different yes, but as far as updating goes it is the same exact thing and a ticker change is typically not a fork or a swap unless you are choosing to do so or that happens, you are missing the point here massively. It also does not cost them 0.5 BTC in any world.
1722 2018-12-19 20:41:11 @BulwarkCoin if you aren’t just trading and looking for huge instant gains. It has listings on several exchanges upcoming and a history for delivering on its promises. I also have a soft spot for @AdEx_Network but I haven’t kept up with this one in a couple months.
1723 2018-12-19 20:41:11 In that document they describe disposing of crypto assets as "using cryptoassets to pay for goods or services"

1744 2018-12-19 20:37:30 How many times can you post the same meme
1745 2018-12-19 20:37:21 I can’t figure out why @robinhood would recreate yahoo finance chatrooms on Robinhood crypto. Worst possible way to legitimize BTC
1746 2018-12-19 20:37:20 Too true. Market is looking like Wall St 2.0 / Big Banks yet again, just utilizing 'blockchain & crypto' and do new takeover on the digital currency forefront. Hopefully the market will bring in new innovations and potentially topple these existing big companies.
1747 2018-12-19 20:36:33 Pete's a ledge.
1748 2018-12-19 20:36:31 There will be no coinbase pump as coinbase basicly lists every crypto at the moment
1749 2018-12-19 20:36:28 OK but if its just a crypto by name and not nature its not of much help. China is a dictatorship and they crush there countrymen; innocents and opponents. Their cyrpto is unlikely yo be a permission-less payment mechanism.

1752 2018-12-19 20:35:59 Is there something coming out regarding XRP or crypto in general?
1753 2018-12-19 20:35:25 We understand folks have misgivings about influencer marketing in crypto. Most of the folks you saw promoting us were engaging in our referral contest, and were otherwise unaffiliated with us or directly paid. But we understand why you might feel this marketing tactic was scammy
1754 2018-12-19 20:35:06 For instance, I’d text a buck in crypto to someone in Bangladesh (in return for....whatever) just to start strengthening the global network among us. 

I dunno. These econ-“lifeboats” around the world are just something on my mind since hearing a presentation by @aantonop

1759 2018-12-19 20:34:21 So true! Listening to the difference in tone between EOS and other crypto podcasts is brutal. Huge gap. Great example is @finchify @BlockchainZack in “everything EOS” vs the normal @icoalert podcast. Nothing against the guys but the space is dead compared to EOS

1781 2018-12-19 20:31:37 Yes you are right. Sad reality of the world we live in. But after being cyber attacked on an almost daily basis the past few years I don’t wish being “crypto profiled” on anyone.
1782 2018-12-19 20:31:18 until that you would have much time to learn basics of trading then

1804 2018-12-19 20:28:31 Climate change is warming to the environment + the side effects. Clearly documented exctinctions exist as a result of climate change. No argument in regards to crypto, but still thinking climate change isn’t real. Come on bro.
1805 2018-12-19 20:28:29 It's a bull trap because it won't go back to 20K yet !
1806 2018-12-19 20:28:20 It is hard to take this article seriously when they spell it as "crypto-currency"
1807 2018-12-19 20:28:13 That’s fantastic! Getting the crypto asset is needed to truly understand it but a major on-boarding hurdle.

Love this approach for solving the chicken-or-the-egg situation.
1808 2018-12-19 20:28:04 BTC just had a relief rally, which might not be over, possible wave 4, and I honestly dont see this being the end of the BTC bear market.  Bullish euphoria also picking up too quickly, which is even more bearish.

1815 2018-12-19 20:26:47 Stocks and crypto are so far from each other as far as rules and how they perform. Be careful with crypto brother
1816 2018-12-19 20:26:16 Je ne dis pas que le film va être nul. Il sera peut être bien. Mais de base, je n'aime pas l'idée de refaire le film d'animation qui était déjà un franc succès. Pour moi à part l'argent il n'y a pas d'autres motif et je trouve ça très moyen

1867 2018-12-19 20:20:50 I'd usually place BTC and crypto as part of the higher risk side of your investment portfolio. And tbh, it's never too early to start having a financial plan. 

As long as you're emphasizing diverse holdings and not counting your high risk portfolio as part of savings, it's OK
1868 2018-12-19 20:20:49 Leave it to the Fed to once again stick to their own personal globalist agenda and stunt all growth from the US Markets. The market was telling them something and yet they ignore it once again.

1871 2018-12-19 20:20:33 Of course, deflationary assets like $XRP have are a great advantage! However, you can take $BTC forks & immediately "fork" them back to $BTC /use as pocket-money or convert to $XRP (or other crypto). You still have the same amount of $BTC so I don't see a catastrophic dilution.

1902 2018-12-19 20:16:12 What do you mean by description?
1903 2018-12-19 20:16:04 Yes, I totally agree. The XRPCommunity is literally 1000’s of people, very knowledgable. Could share with you information that would allow you to publish a great article. Be a front runner. Crypto is not the future; it is the NOW !!!
1904 2018-12-19 20:15:57 これはETCか。イーサリアムがハードフォークした結果生まれた通貨だ。theDAOの事件があった後、イーサリアムが「事件が起きなかった時のチェーンまで巻き戻します」と実質的なロールバックを行って、それに怒った採掘者たちが反発して今日まで動いている。まぁ思想の違うイーサリアムだな。
1905 2018-12-19 20:15:51 I'm presenting the case for the the real bitcoin. There are two demographics in the space now - the bitcoin religion, and the crypto capitalists. TRB is for the bitcoin religion, hence it's monotheistic pitch.

1928 2018-12-19 20:13:24 none of all. Some stablecoins maybe, but crypto money on blockchain they only support such a coin which is fiat like and centrally controlled by banks with infinit supply.

1932 2018-12-19 20:12:40 Yes. the Dollar often trades against the stock market. Crypto probably is more of a coincedence.
1933 2018-12-19 20:12:36 This is a good point — would just say that the bar was set so low for finance blockchains that the idea resembled more a cost-sharing joint venture to pool resources. So yes, became increasingly a Trojan horse for automation/digitisation and not genuine decentralisation.

1939 2018-12-19 20:12:00 I apologize for gross oversimplification or if this thought is like Coase Theorum duh! But is legit Crypto/bitcoin essentiallly a hedge against or more accurately bet on the shrinking of American Hegemony?  At some point, does United Nations become involved as regulatory forum?
1940 2018-12-19 20:11:54 So many *high conviction* crypto VC's looking like scared sheep right now.

1942 2018-12-19 20:11:32 I thought it was too
1943 2018-12-19 20:11:30 Riddle me this, if it's centralized, what is the point? The entire cryptomovement was founded on the idea of creating a peer to peer electronic currency. The very nature of any peer to peer is decentralization. Without that aspect I dont understand what u think crypto is
1944 2018-12-19 20:11:02 All these people shilling $XRP knowing the ‘coin’ will be worthless in the future

2063 2018-12-19 19:58:28 Something I’ve noticed regarding @coinbase and @binance
#coinbase is FILTERING the market so that their investors wouldn’t get hurt. 

It is why they are taking so long to add all these #crypto. 

#binance has more options but look at how many coins they delisted in the past.
2064 2018-12-19 19:58:27 Had to create another user for my phone since I had to many apps with "bit" on their name which suggested I'm big on #crypto, this new user only carries normal apps like @Pornhub and @tinder. I can now go through customs without having to suffer inspection of cavities.

2071 2018-12-19 19:58:02 I kinda like Uphold, but it's pretty annoying to have funds clear my bank and sit in limbo for a week every time I purchase. I thought crypto was supposed to be about FASTER money transfers. I could write a check, hop on a bicycle, and hand deliver funds faster than that.

2083 2018-12-19 19:56:59 I'm finding BTC performs to the same rules as any other markets, but to your point it is only part of my plan. Currently prioritizing fiat emergency fund > Ira contributions > stocks/crypto.

2089 2018-12-19 19:56:22 I think you need to study how economics works. So far the crypto experiment has produced few winners but many losers.
2090 2018-12-19 19:56:17 Doesn't necessarily mean they bought follower, crypto twitter is filled with fake accounts that just follow random people for some reason

2102 2018-12-19 19:55:18 In contrast to broken promises of @ethereum, new blockcahins like @ThunderProtocol, which is catering to the Ethereum DApp developers, are showing how to execute on crypto projects.

2109 2018-12-19 19:54:49 If $BTC drops anyways out of its own technical over extended situation, expect the narrative to be around rate hikes.
2110 2018-12-19 19:54:42 he's worth over 100M. Bernanke had a mortgage. Powell won't need to give speeches at crypto events for money. He can't be bought w speaking fees post Fed
2111 2018-12-19 19:54:27 I respect that you're honest about it 
2112 2018-12-19 19:54:21 The belief that people will not invest in crypto when stock markets or economic conditions is down has been debunked with this?
2113 2018-12-19 19:54:20 These other cryptos dumped to over -90% while Chainlink made an ATH in 2018. x4 against the market. So if any crypto could made such big steps, it's LINK.

2120 2018-12-19 19:53:11 I agree I've stopped reading those articles written by anyone who can create an account and post a blog with grammar mistakes and tell you about how your crypto will change the world.
2121 2018-12-19 19:53:05 I don’t understand why Crypto youtubers give 5 different scenarios. Yes, stay open to other possibilities, but for the purpose of a video it’s best to give the projection you believe price heading, otherwise you can just say in the beginning “price can go up down or sideways.”
2122 2018-12-19 19:52:59 I agree it is interesting, I was watching it too. That being said, it's probably not as responsive as say equities indices, so I'll be watching the next 24 hours to really begin to consider it a weathered storm

2134 2018-12-19 19:49:58 Good luck getting a respectable audit firm to put their seal of approval on a crypto asset. Until we have clear regulatory guidance on exactly what this space is; commodity, currency or security, no auditor worth his salt will touch this.

2140 2018-12-19 19:49:26 Im bullish on $ZRX because 90% of coinbase users will buy it because it's cheap and the chart looks killer. Now I think $BTC has stabilized, & the bottom is in,  and I'm #crypto shopping. No money to be made in the $SPY or $IWM for a while thanks to the stupid #fed
2141 2018-12-19 19:49:25 Why no love crypto?
2142 2018-12-19 19:49:22 Small sale on $XRP in 10 minutes! 
Thanks @coinbase
2143 2018-12-19 19:49:21 It’s tough on deals that don’t do proper paperwork which means few Crypto deals up until this point will have accurate data because it will all be unconfirmed and/or self-reported. When I launched INVST we digested all public data and all reported data to CB, filings, etc...
2144 2018-12-19 19:49:20 If somebody has been in crypto since before 2015 there is ZERO chance their advice is valid.

2172 2018-12-19 19:45:32 Due to the quarter system, it doesn't start til April, so you have a few months to go West, young man.

2175 2018-12-19 19:45:18 Why does Bloomberg worship billionaires and hate crypto so much?
2176 2018-12-19 19:45:09 Why would you do this to crypto?!?

2291 2018-12-19 19:31:56 No. What I’m saying is I think bitfinex sold USDT in exchange for crypto like btc. So bitfinex ends up with $100M worth of btc and issue $100M USDT. All fine right? 100% backed. Well, what if bitcoin price goes down and they’re still holding btc and USDT holders want their USD?

2336 2018-12-19 19:27:44 People spending their energy trying to find someone else to blame for their poor decisions when they should be focusing on learning from those decisions. They paid well enough for it, did they not? #Crypto #Investing #Responsibility
2337 2018-12-19 19:27:30 yes you are correct, but on a DEX the interface does the matching and reduces somewhat the friction wouldn't you say?

2339 2018-12-19 19:27:29 They block everyone! Your Twitter experience is so much better for it. Condescending clowns all of them. They cause so much rubbish. Tiffany is a nasty spiteful joke.
2340 2018-12-19 19:27:23 lmfao "peter the deleter"
2341 2018-12-19 19:27:12 nothing personal...just tired of people buying crypto and all of a sudden they are Larry Williams.

2344 2018-12-19 19:27:02 Let's generously cut down the 35M verified by a factor of 80%, assuming the MAU accounts are lower, still 7M, so that means the crypto-in-the-90s analogy puts us at '96.
2345 2018-12-19 19:26:50 Keep Calm! Just Buy and HODL!
2346 2018-12-19 19:26:49 No offence taken as questions are always welcome.

@ArbitradeX plan been to bring $DIG up to its floor “price”.

But i know it is a very hard task to get banks, auditors, governments ect to work with a crypto project.

But IMO only a question of “time”
2347 2018-12-19 19:26:35 Everyone forgot peter brandt made a $50k bitcoin chart and just deleted it to run with the $4k narrative 

That’s how he got the name “peter the deleter”
2348 2018-12-19 19:26:27 Great quote! I think many have lost site in what crypto is all about or never even understood it.

2355 2018-12-19 19:25:20 The goal being to use alternative models to remove dependencies on the above. I run my life through FB but wouldn't shed any tears; equitable systems for social networking, governance etc brought a lot of us towards crypto and following people like you in the first place.

2366 2018-12-19 19:24:26 The blockchain space sometimes feels like just drama and noise, but when I move large amounts crypto across the room or across the world for <$0.10, and it gets there basically instantly with no middleman or gatekeeper, I'm reminded that this technology is pretty damn cool.
2367 2018-12-19 19:24:25 There's no reason why the world can't "go full crypto" tomorrow, or full any other non-USD fiat. YET...

The reason why the reserve currency is the USD is because of TRUST. Everybody else is trusted less & US is the enemy that everybody knows. It's predictable. Crypto is not.Yet.

Also, Twitter (especially followers of crypto personalities) is not a reliable target group to guage sentiment. But you already knew that :)

2461 2018-12-19 19:12:27 How cheap would it be to pay nodes to handle a stable crypto ecosystem that actually worked as good money? Probably $50k a year total. But nobody uses crypto so the nodes wouldn't get paid that much in fees. And you think bitcoin deserves a 60 billion dollar market cap.... why?

2463 2018-12-19 19:12:13 The crypto market needs to continue its decline, preferably to the $1,000 -1,500 BTC level and rebuild from there. My guess is, the $3,200 BTC level will not hold and this recent bounce will be short-lived.

2525 2018-12-19 19:02:51 The illiquidy of crypto is not from conversion to other currencies. That is done almost instantly. The illiquidy comes from it being slow to make and not many people accepting them directly.

2529 2018-12-19 19:02:29 Actually, there’s a second use case: crypto could more easily control one account per person and link to state-issued ID. This is critical wrt helicopter money and solving obvious double-issuance problems. My guess is wechat directly links to RMB crypto accounts for this reason

2629 2018-12-19 18:50:18 Yes, I know it. But looks like btc price is rising!
2630 2018-12-19 18:49:55 That's not really fair though. Many of the Goldman reports saying "stay away" were written by research analysts that likely had no knowledge of Goldman's involvement with a small crypto outfit.
2631 2018-12-19 18:49:54 not sure where crypto fits in here. people may choose to hold it in addition to or instead of fiat and money in banks, but otherwise there isn’t really a “crypto” project ready for global business, other than HODLing, for most people.

2634 2018-12-19 18:49:50 i think the euphoria is for the sign that this move is kicking off reversal, so it is not about the return 5-20% but what the return will be 1 year from now as a result. 

before i got into crypto i was a macro trader, never seen any market make wild sentiment shifts like crypto

2642 2018-12-19 18:48:53 Market maturity is kind of a hot topic for #crypto-fundamentalists. But no matter what side you fall on, you have to admit, the market of cryptos needs to grow.

2705 2018-12-19 18:42:36 Only advantage that I see is ability to more deeply integrate with rapidly growing crypto ecosystem rather than silo it. Whether one connects via crypto, API, or a centralized ledger is irrelevant as they all connect to the same faucet:)
2706 2018-12-19 18:42:25 If a “shape up” means trimming my beard at home, every week, and cleaning it up with a straight razor, having a tight, clean look that women appreciate, then I guess I have a shape up.

2747 2018-12-19 18:37:40 I hope I can ask you a relatively noobish question. Traded crypto for a while, am relatively new to "traditional" markets.

Why would Gold and Silver prices depreciate if we go into a recession or crash? Or are miners valueation too independent from that? Is it about the Dollar?

2749 2018-12-19 18:37:30 i don't understand why so many people think crypto will destroy the financial system
crypto will become part of the financial system (and many other parts of our life)
that's the only way to get mass adoption imo

2751 2018-12-19 18:37:14 A IRL crypto guy from Venezuela said no one is using those altcoins, sorry I can't find the youtube video. I doubt anyone has real metrics as to the use of crypto in Venezuela.

2758 2018-12-19 18:36:12 @Lukewearechange, I cancelled my #WeAreChange subscription through Patreon and noticed that PayPal is your only credit card option.

Crypto is very inconvenient for auto payments.

Any plans for an auto cc payment apart from #PayPal? /1

They can capture the crypto branding while deploying digital RMB on a highly centralized ledger--a "better cryptocurrency" for the masses

2763 2018-12-19 18:35:48 Guy I work with told me yesterday he put a little money into Bitcoin. He's never shown any interest in crypto. It's a sign normal retailer investors are starting to get back in. I remember when this happened last year.
2764 2018-12-19 18:35:35 No Comex rule. I.e the cornering of precious metals like silver, which JPmorgan apparently did. In other words somebody is cornering the crypto Xrp market to cause scarcity and when demand is needed the price will rocket

2794 2018-12-19 18:32:06 Compared to normal business Dynamism, crypto/BC has a much larger growth rate because it's a new & wide-ranging tech (with no debt). Failure rates are about the same so far.

2890 2018-12-19 18:20:28 Tapcoin/Hooch and mfchain are worthy projects as well. Hooch already has a viable business before tapcoin addition. that is where i invest now in addition to crypto to fiat. Stand alone coins not so much. Too many of those
2891 2018-12-19 18:20:23 Agreed
2892 2018-12-19 18:20:20 The US government is going to jump into crypto within the next 5 years, do you have any idea how much counterfeit USD is made on a daily basis? enough to move into crypto asap.

When asked if cryptocurrency represents a new asset class, Hayes expressed skepticism, saying crypto “is sort of a blend” but that it is “still extremely small”
2897 2018-12-19 18:19:53 It's true I've boycotted both. I'm in the process of learning how crypto works so that I can be ready if people find a suitable platform. I'm not sure what other alternatives there are :S I was hoping subscribestar would be up and running

2901 2018-12-19 18:19:29 Decentralization is a means to an end to achieve bitcoin's main value proposition. Pretty much all other "crypto" could deliver thier value prop better as a centralized project (which most are anyway).

I, speaking for myself, not a fan of gold.

2940 2018-12-19 18:14:35 Agreed - As we will discuss in a later question, the later versions of the ransomware are built quite well in terms of the crypto implementation.

2948 2018-12-19 18:13:21 Short answer is the affiliate model that makes it available to ransomware as a service operators. Each affiliate has their own spreading technique and can customize pricing.

3015 2018-12-19 18:06:47 Are you showing that in USD? Of course everything’s going to be up because BTC just jumped 20%. Doesn’t mean that alts themselves are jumping that high as far as btc value goes. Rather misleading
3016 2018-12-19 18:06:46 I am leaning more to "Bitcoin not blockchain" thinking lately, especially from an investing point of view, cryptonetworks ultimately solve the trust issue however in many commerce transaction trust is a given. Biggest killer app of crypto is still payment and store of value.
3017 2018-12-19 18:06:20 Looks like NONE of the XRP price predictions are going to happen by EOY 2018. Probably won't make $10 until 2020+. Which if you're gainfully employed in this shitty economy that's great, but some of us have been forced to dig into our crypto holdings to live off of..

3044 2018-12-19 18:02:55 @Cryptonary_ hey bro. What can we do about it, surely we should revolt? Its a matter of principle. Would be good to give some lessons on how to circumvent crypto taxes legally ofcourse. In my eyes, crypto not taxable so screw them

Judging by the market jump & this publication, it’s possible a market surge is inbound and they want to jump ship to ensure they get their lovely tax payouts.

3135 2018-12-19 17:54:03 So crypto is basically the 21st century snake oil.
3136 2018-12-19 17:54:02 Coinbase is slowly becoming the Apple of the crypto game. They’re taking their sweet time to add features, new coins, and only new crypto investors seem excited when these news come out.
3137 2018-12-19 17:53:58 This is real.
3138 2018-12-19 17:53:49 True, as long as "everything about everything" includes basics that are often lost on generalists:
- Computing architectures
- Logic & algorithms
- Low level coding
- Comms protocols
- Crypto primitives and implementations
- Litany of fails to the above

3190 2018-12-19 17:45:37 "How do you trade crypto?"
"Just follow the dog and the duck"

magic internet money ftw.
3191 2018-12-19 17:45:34 Buying crypto again
3192 2018-12-19 17:45:27 Well, there had been a market for them in Crypto, but that’s not as much of a thing anymore

XRP Baby!!
3196 2018-12-19 17:44:55 Is it just me or is the crypto crap pumping when #BTC consolidates? #BCH #BSV are diluting the run.
3197 2018-12-19 17:44:34 Don't make the mistake of thinking that cryptocurrencies won't evolve. The space is constantly developing, much like the internet in the 90s. It was slow back then, nobody understood the concept of email, and the opportunity was missed by many. Crypto is similar, in my opinion.
3198 2018-12-19 17:44:34 The idea that something fungible like money is the #1 thing you need to secure with crypto, rather than human privacy and autonomy over one's own life, is a ridiculous idea that only techbros could invent.
3199 2018-12-19 17:44:21 If that sell wall at 120 sats gets moved we could easily see 120-124 sats on Vet.

3201 2018-12-19 17:44:14 Yeah I’d say less noise but StockTwits Community is less crypto focused and more stocks. That’s how my account on there is too, definitely post more about stocks and a little on crypto. If you just want my crypto this is the place and crypto community on twitter still better imo
3202 2018-12-19 17:44:14 Well done now I'm just thinking about pina colada and i'm at work.
3203 2018-12-19 17:44:03 What do you mean? So the whole idea of crypto is wrong ?
3204 2018-12-19 17:43:57 looks like you grew some balls
3205 2018-12-19 17:43:57 What is with all these crypto payment processor companies?  The major crypto sales pitch is that it is peer to peer and removes fee charging financial intermediaries.  Truth is, there are way more intermediaries and fees in crypto than traditional commerce.

3220 2018-12-19 17:43:05 Furthermore, by ignoring XRP for the past several years they've helped to bolster the narrative that they are just "protecting their bags." I would hope that this is not the case, as it would be seen as manipulation. No more games. Just let the market decide.
3221 2018-12-19 17:43:03 The AMA with @bgarlinghouse yesterday was really refreshing to reiterate the extent of how great this year actually was for Ripple. 2019 beckons for more global adoption and tighter regulations #xrpcommmunity #xrp #ripple #crypto

3283 2018-12-19 17:35:19 Majority of the ERC20 tokens have no real use cases and add no value to our cryptocurrency ecosystem. It's the lazy man development. Stop creating ERC20 tokens and start building real blockchains.

3296 2018-12-19 17:33:34 It doesn't deserve to be #400.
3297 2018-12-19 17:33:32 Y’a plus l’abattement pour durée de détention avec le flat tax. Les gains de crypto sont au final fiscalisés comme les valeurs mobilières, dans le fond je trouve ça plutôt logique.

3299 2018-12-19 17:33:26 While I do agree. They could be more transparent with regard to their intentions around XRP. They seem to just let the constant speculation of adding/not adding fester, leading to anger among their customer base. Seems like an odd approach to handling the #2 asset in this space.

It's more effective than selling in bear market.

It's a meaningless shit phrase in crypto with no valid use, let's get rid of it!

3340 2018-12-19 17:28:35 the real crypto market cap of a real bubble should be around 5-6 trn. 

I arrive at that number by indexing the nasdaq bubble for 20 years a d multiplying by 2 because of global phenom. 

Real bubble is yet to come.

3351 2018-12-19 17:27:22 Anyway, i believe this is one last bull trap, we have yet to see the final lows... And after that, there will one final stage of accumulation and then the big bull run in 2019
3352 2018-12-19 17:27:12 What advantage would a #crypto RMB have over the regular RMB? Monetary would not change. Government would still make the rules. They would not use wasteful proof of work, so the blockchain would essentially be an append only database with replication & users wouldn't care.

Since the 1971 UN vote, China has slowly crept its way into Africa via large “infrastructure” projects that are financed by their state owned Export-Import Bank. These little interest loans will soon be replaced by “crypto yuan” to fuel more industrialization

3448 2018-12-19 17:12:46 their "maintenance fee" is a complete scam - it's much higher above the price of mining profitability. Also, they provide zero proof of equipment so most likely are not mining and simply pay old customers out of new customers "investments". Classic ponzi scheme 101

3464 2018-12-19 17:09:12 Is that what this is about? Tribalism? Critical thinking needed in this community more so then ever. Devolving to territorialism and clout scalping/maintaining is cave manish. Be above.

3472 2018-12-19 17:07:56 what about #crypto?
3473 2018-12-19 17:07:51 はにゃさん、それ正解www
3474 2018-12-19 17:07:48 You need to be intellectually curious, you need to be brave, and control your emotions, can’t find a better definition for a crypto trader. Tnks for sharing the video!
3475 2018-12-19 17:07:42 The most likely long term outcome imo will be a mix between fiat and btc. I don’t see us switching over completely to one or the other. On-ramps like this are exactly what we need to make crypto more accessible to everyday people.
3476 2018-12-19 17:07:37 Not yet.

3509 2018-12-19 17:04:16 It's unfortunate because from what I've read of the comments of all involved historically, they are of the same POV regarding XRP, and crypto, etc.

3542 2018-12-19 17:00:34 Learning about the 'information for the masses' made all the difference to me. It's actually pretty tricky to stay aware of this, and even smart traders might possibly find themselves part of the dumb money fueling such failed corrections.

3670 2018-12-19 16:46:04 If its a state issued crypto, its suffers from the same issues of centralization that plague fiat currently. Aside from a means to outlaw cryptos, this cant really change the fact that a regime without sound money  will eventually fail.

3812 2018-12-19 16:29:50 I've been "HODLing" my index fund for the past 15 years.  Granted the money may have (likely, I suppose) been put to better use.  But people do traditionally "HODL" their investments.  It sounds like you're saying this is a bad strategy for crypto specifically?
3813 2018-12-19 16:29:17 @mappopk_crypto I like it
3814 2018-12-19 16:29:05 This would mean a very bad experience for those who buy into a coin only supported by one website no matter how big that site is crypto needs to flow freely for mass adoption who would be happy putting their money into a coin with such restricted use case?
3815 2018-12-19 16:28:54 Using crypto to pay for your Amazon order or your morning cup of coffee is much harder than swiping your card or using your phone’s wallet. This is what keeps us from making crypto a part of our day-to-day because we really don’t need the extra challenges.  @Upthinity

These #cryptos will be owned by these companies, and they have no accountability to their users –they don’t care what’s good for users. BTC will always be better for society.

4014 2018-12-19 16:04:17 Bubbles are mathematically impossible with crypto currency
4015 2018-12-19 16:04:09 That's impossible unless central banks follow the Chicago Plan, cutting commercial banks out of the printing machine, asking for 100% proof of reserve. That's a change cannot be done in 5 years. And Crypto Fiat does not need chains at all, just spin up a server.

4047 2018-12-19 16:01:24 Oui c'est ce qui se passe le plus souvent...maintenant le marché des crypto est incroyablement volatile & imprévisible. Tout dépend ce qu'on appelle par "quelques temps".

J'ai toujours la crainte de voir $BTC creuser à 2400$ et moins d'ici les prochains mois
4048 2018-12-19 16:01:20 I don't really have a problem with bigger accounts shilling obvious scamcoins ... as long as they actually acknowledge that the project is a scamcoin with no real, long-term value. Won't deny that these coins usually pump hard, but at least be honest about it.

4085 2018-12-19 15:57:45 I think the most interesting thing to compare the difference between traditional tokenized systems (arcades) and crypto tokenized systems (erc-20's) are a few things:

- UX friction
- Liquidity of tokens
- Deflationary supply of tokens

4135 2018-12-19 15:52:40 I think it’s hard to label a “net negative for the world” for crypto.

4144 2018-12-19 15:51:26 Funny to see crypto currencies getting a slight boost after multiple creators announced that they're leaving Patreon and an alternative service is being worked on that doesn't involve mainstream payment methods.

4171 2018-12-19 15:48:34 The Crypto community needs to STOP equating:

Decentralizated == always BETTER &
Centralized == always WORSE

Even a slight bit of common sense would tell you that this is incorrect. Context matters.

4219 2018-12-19 15:42:39 Imo the promise of crypto is that it gets users on a good rail system where they don't have to constantly be wondering if a corporation is exploiting them. Why stop at Facebook? Do I need to take action against Google, Amazon, et al, every single time they exploit me or my data?
4220 2018-12-19 15:42:33 The amount of Ico’s seen in 2017 was unhealthy. BTC raised and the amount of BTC that is now being put back into the market to fund the projects, suppressing the price.

4241 2018-12-19 15:41:22 The sad thing is that the people who are actually good and making accurate predictions in Crypto are few, unpopular and they post out information for free

4243 2018-12-19 15:41:19 EXACTLY. Look into the people who invested in Ripple. Ripple is just one piece of the equation. If you follow the money, you will see what is really going on. Ripple is the gate keeper for XRP, they are heavily invested in creating crypto ecosystem. XRP is everybodys payday.
4244 2018-12-19 15:41:16 Are you still against crypto (and do decentralized systems fall into that bucket?). Just curious what's your solution here? A better, more responsible corporate culture than Facebook? Smarter users? Don't think you'll gain much traction hoping for individual action...

4256 2018-12-19 15:40:27 Anyways, I may be ignorant of something. I just thought that the whole point of crypto was to REPLACE legacy layers with something more efficient, effective, and flexible. I guess in the future, everyone still shuffles around papers.  Star Trek had me fooled...
4257 2018-12-19 15:40:19 That's no fun, then you would come back to the present with changed future, lots of money, and this year of 2018 is great, but boring. I assure you not nearly as if we let 2019 to roll out as the best year in #crypto history. $XRP #limitless

4289 2018-12-19 15:36:06 TeraWATT customers and other businesses will want to accept our payment tokens, because our deflation rate is much higher than all FIAT currencies, and most, if not all, crypto conventions / tokens, as well as more private and secure zk-SNARKS and masternodes. #terawatt_led #ico

4298 2018-12-19 15:35:08 Vitalik Buterin donated $300,000 in #ETH to developers of the next ETH iteration, saying “I expect results”. However, these devs already received combined $750,000 in donations from ETH Foundation. #Crypto is so complex, that simply throwing money at the problem doesn’t solve it.
4299 2018-12-19 15:34:58 Draag zelf de verantwoordelijkheid voor je eigen investeringen. En als het een probleem is dat we morgen zakken, moet je vooral geen geld in crypto steken. Die kans is namelijk zeer groot.

4335 2018-12-19 15:31:30 Disagree with your premise. 

Stablecoins were meant to solve currency volatility. Currently all stablecoins solve that problem.

Some stablecoins added censorship resistance, which is a core part of crypto. Some added issuer control.

4354 2018-12-19 15:27:45 In my opinion I don't think this is the start of the next bull run, there is still too much excitement and anticipation, when we have green and everybody believes it's a bear trap and no excitement then we will see a bull run.

4439 2018-12-19 15:18:26 Despite originally being forecast as the ‘year of the bull’, most crypto assets are currently down significantly from this time last year. On the upside, much progress has been made to legitimize crypto’s use and adoption at a governmental and international level.

4465 2018-12-19 15:15:59 Here are some reasons (guesses) for the #bitcoin price drop:

1. 99% of crypto is fraud.

2. Nothing is retail ready.

3. Adoption will take < 5 years  not 5 days.

4. Tech talent in crypto is embarrassing.

5. Fed ending the boom.
4466 2018-12-19 15:15:58 So all these #stablecoins are stable vs USD, will enable digitisation of assets in...yes, USD...so isn't that net positive for the USD? and I thought that #crypto was supposed to be the end of the Dollar...#btc #bitcoin #eth #ethereum #blockchain #tether #USDT

4483 2018-12-19 15:14:36 Why would anyone want to use a crypto fiat when they already have plenty of other digital fiat options? People like cash because of privacy. That feature is completely removed with crypto fiat. In other words, the government's gain in control comes at a cost to its citizens.

4488 2018-12-19 15:13:49 Well, maybe not a global currency, but more of a global asset like Gold and Silver. Because, governments won't be ready to accept it as a form of currency as crypto behaves more like an asset i.e. Anyone can produce it and it's not limited to anyone nation

4537 2018-12-19 15:08:15 You know what would be terrible (kinda)?
If gov't decided crypto is non taxable currency. 
(I know that would create a lot of demand)

But then after so many people made $ last year, paid taxes... Then lost lots of $ this year and wouldn't be able to deduct off taxes.
4538 2018-12-19 15:08:14 The only downside to you statement is that Coinbase is the number one exchange to use fiat with. How else can some buy crypto if is not with fiat? I know others have fiat options but everyone uses Coinbase for that.

4563 2018-12-19 15:05:59 Functionally speaking thats good to hear, but personally my soul crys any time I hear people talk about "selling" crypto. I never went and bought, or earned, pesos or euro to sell them for usd. Im in the middle of building a diy skyminer and all coinhours will go to fiber apps
4564 2018-12-19 15:05:52 Case of Crypto meningitis on HIV+ patients with yeast forms on CSF and negative Crypto Serum Ag. Think of causes of false negative Crypto Serum Ag: 
• Prozone effect 
• Acapsular or poorly encapsulated 
organisms 
• Low fungal burden 
• Localized disease
4565 2018-12-19 15:05:44 Crypto is going to be better than any stock to invest in. @Bakkt,  @DigitalAssets, @ErisX_Digital all coming soon 
4566 2018-12-19 15:05:42 @JasonWitten any interest in crypto currencies?
4567 2018-12-19 15:05:40 チャートだけは見てたけど始めてなかったから羨ましかった
年始からスタートで暴騰はまだ味わってないので楽しみです！
4568 2018-12-19 15:05:30 Killer apps are emerging. Wait till media picks up on some of these developing stories. Most people still think Crypto is just Bitcoin. Wait till many start getting on #dapps
4569 2018-12-19 15:05:18 Look what happened when #MarshallIslands wanted to unpeg from #USD to #crypto called SOV [sovereign].
4570 2018-12-19 15:05:12  Prices update in $USDT (1 hour):

$EOS - 2.63 $        (+0.19 %)

$ETC - 4.48 $        (-0.07 %)

4571 2018-12-19 15:05:07 I bet!!
4572 2018-12-19 15:05:07 You’re deciding between #BTC and #ETH. 

Current prices are $3781 and $104. 

All-time highs were $20,000 and $1,500.

For every $1,000 invested you get 0.26 BTC or 9.6 ETH. 

If ath’s are hit again, which is the better coin to hold? #crypto #bitcoin #ethereum

4574 2018-12-19 15:04:58 @thejaylonsmith what do you know about crypto?
4575 2018-12-19 15:04:44 Yes got filled. So I am back again
4576 2018-12-19 15:04:34 Also not my TA* this was something posted to a group i am a part of!

4583 2018-12-19 15:03:38 Dude this is too funny
4584 2018-12-19 15:03:34 If you'd read this book you could have lost your savings in Bitcoin like a champ, rather than losing them in crypto, like a shitcoiner!  
More seriously, though, this isn't financial advice and I don't think investing in bitcoin is for everyone, so be careful out there!
4585 2018-12-19 15:03:30 They can not be compared since they are going after different values. #Bitcoin is developing to be the most secure and decentralized, borderless and censorship-resistant token for transfer and storage of value. The rest are businesses that use the crypto hype to become popular.
4586 2018-12-19 15:03:14 What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party. #bitcoin #BTC #blockchain #crypto

4593 2018-12-19 15:02:38 Well yeah, I've done some fancy dining if I made a sick profit, but the question here is if people actually had to give up quality of food/health because of their investment in crypto.

4616 2018-12-19 14:59:39 I can't read the whole post so my guess is that crypto police "elites" are rounding here...
Do these people realize that people hasn't to preach their gospel to grow their lack of ego???

4618 2018-12-19 14:59:26 Have to think of these types of days in a behavioral economics type of mindset. Because we are still in crypto bear market, rallies need to be viewed with skepticism and profits should be taken at key down-sloping averages. That is what I did this AM. Others doing same probably.

4629 2018-12-19 14:58:29 The previous rejection from the top of this channel was M shaped... Meaning that if we see another rejection, this one will be much more vertical (head and shoulder). Could we see it just free-falling to 2900 after today ?
4630 2018-12-19 14:58:22 Honestly who has $70k to just throw into crypto in the first place. You crazy
4631 2018-12-19 14:58:21 Great. Now I’ll just have to convince my wife to let me spend that dough after losing our savings in crypto .

4659 2018-12-19 14:54:48 Considering the fall in crypto and stocks this year, I'm actually proud of that number. 
4660 2018-12-19 14:54:42 Please read the rest of the story, join the telegram. Its nog pcn anymore... team stepped up bigtime!
4661 2018-12-19 14:54:34 First actual "use-case" for crypto (potentially) is server/computing infrastructure. Another, more abstract potential, comes from blockchain greatly reducing verification costs for transactions. Anything else?

4664 2018-12-19 14:54:00 Is the crypto "bear market" a leading indicator of broader economic problems?
4665 2018-12-19 14:53:57 Just silently watching, none of us want to jinx it . This year has been rough, but the learning opportunity has those of us who stayed through it ready for the next run, whether it is now, 6 months from now, or a year down the road, or more.
4666 2018-12-19 14:53:52 Because the US dollar is going to crash and institutions know it
4667 2018-12-19 14:53:50 The first bear market charts in crypto have been very useful all year 
4668 2018-12-19 14:53:47 the point is that once they DO have the capital they will turn to digital assets first.

4685 2018-12-19 14:52:27 Put your money in to Crypto, XRP!
4686 2018-12-19 14:52:19 それはそう思います。ZkDaiとEnigmaは別物ですが、この業界って後追いがどうしても有利なので、先行プロジェクトはBTCやETHみたいに圧倒的なネットワークとコミュニティ形成がないと負ける可能性が高く、その点Enigmaってどうなんだろうなと。
4687 2018-12-19 14:52:15 Alts need a 2000% rise to get back from a 95% fall.......let me say it again, they need to a 2000% rise...so 30-40% is measly for HoLDers...for a scalping daytrader that's off a off the hook gain

4746 2018-12-19 14:45:50 @HMRCcustomers I noticed you updated your policy on crypto. What's not clear is how you treat crypto obtained through staking. Staking isn't mining. In many cases You don't "do" any "work" to get it. It appears automatically in your wallet, like a dividend. How is this taxed?

1.) Huge markup and fees on resale because middlemen like Ticketmaster own the closed marketplaces.

2.) Scams. Someone can sell me a ticket, which is just a PDF, and still use it or sell to someone else.

4875 2018-12-19 14:31:28 The electronic money market is falling deeply. But Nexty's prices are still stable, even up from last week. This proves that people have a lot of belief in Nexty and I think the future is not very far, Nexty can replace bitcoin. #crypto #nexty #bitcoin

4911 2018-12-19 14:28:11 Because this is most probably 4th elliot wave. The 5th wave will take btc to 1k. We'll not see a bull run before that. Unless we see a stock market crash. That would change everything..
4912 2018-12-19 14:28:06 While all crypto on conmarketcap fell sharply, the Nexty Platform remained firmly in the market.

5046 2018-12-19 14:15:55 I think it's a personal thing found through trial and error. I used to trade stocks and i felt they didn't move fast enough. Then I found crypto and it's a more dynamic and volatile market that seems to suit better with my personality.

5135 2018-12-19 14:05:29 Tu as un commentaire pour décrire une fausse idée / rumeur que les gens extérieurs ont face à la crypto et argumenter contre cette idée. Tu dis quoi?

5136 2018-12-19 14:05:29 I’ll wait for a bull flag (consolidation) Good advice tho to scale in, thanks.

5183 2018-12-19 14:01:07 The most arent using is yet is regulations. Something the whole crypto market is waiting for. Without $XRP use they will leave a hefty cost, risk, speed saving on the table.. all the incentive for them to use it. 1 hint. US won’t be first in this.

5221 2018-12-19 13:57:29 Reason why trading bots should use @the_Blocknet as an arbitrage hub: 

- a plethora of exchanges to arbitrage across as bots arbitraging different 
markets link in (no need for multiple CEX accounts)

- no deposits and withdrawals 

- low fee 

- quick transfer confirmation time
5222 2018-12-19 13:57:28 And with the drop in prices due to over production and the end of crypto mining and what not, they're a steal!

5227 2018-12-19 13:57:06 @CryptoShillNye the market variance (daily,) is sufficient enough to make money in a Bull or Bear Market. Grant it, we all want the Bull run, but you and I both know that you make your money when you buy. Thats true in REI, Crypto, stock market, etc, etc...
5228 2018-12-19 13:56:58 It looks like Christmast has gone. It is still great time to buy but only the best and diversify. Iota, Wanchain, Matrix Ai, Utrust. Bnb is very safe crypto bet and it should 3x 10-12 months.

So many projects that will vanish, so i just dont want that people loose money!
In my modest opinion, with just a few knowledge of crypto assets, my favorite to grow are: xrp, eos, ada, hot..and maybe trx!

5288 2018-12-19 13:51:15 This is just partly true. Bitcoin is the most useful currency humanity ever created so far. It is the hardest money in existence. The rest of the crypto market which had its biggest hype in 2017, is exactly what you say.
5289 2018-12-19 13:51:11 All of crypto is pegged to Bitcoin. When Bitcoin pumps so do alts. Alts have smaller market caps so are easier to manipulate. Hence easier to pump and dump on idiots buying them.

5291 2018-12-19 13:51:06 I will not hesitate to tell you that the nexty platform (NTY)  is the best platform today. Although it is currently not popular, but in the future, it will pass bitcoin to become the coinmarketcap leader. #crypto#nexty #bitcoin #nty

5297 2018-12-19 13:50:49 @Altcoinbuzzio you think that institutions have crashed bitcoin before the recession really kicks off to then pump it as the traditional markets crash to "show it off" as a typical commodity like gold?

5344 2018-12-19 13:47:49 I disagree entirely. If you're accruing less than 10% on your loans, whereas crypto is returning 100% y/y, paying those loans off is actually not rational. I know you've been trained to think paying debt to exploitative banks is "responsible" but in actuality... It is idiotic.

5360 2018-12-19 13:46:25 Crypto journalism must rely upon unassailable facts- not speculation, conspiracy theories, or emotion. Crypto communities are already rife with the latter. We need quality, impartial journalism to be the lighthouse in this sea of tribal noise.

Me: how to hang up phones from the command line in a VG 200. Reset a promina 100 to fix loss of crypto lock (use a dime). That satellite always adds 600+ ms to network latency. Finally- how to reboot the cutter/scorer in a cardboard plant

5417 2018-12-19 13:41:30 Bitcoin front running yet again.  The mere existence of the federal reserve system is now bullish for bitcoin.  There is no decision that powell can make that doesn't have the potential to be bullish.  And there is no direction, market/crypto, that would be a surprise.
5418 2018-12-19 13:41:29 You won't get a trophy for winning a battle with yourself on when to enter/exit/abandon a trade.  

But you will gain:

- A skillset that will guarantee you success over the long run. 

- Permanent character growth which will help you in other aspects of your life.

5428 2018-12-19 13:40:31 The general term shitcoins yes, but each individual one lost to BTC in the long run. The way it lost is that whenever it pumped hard, it dumped harder.
5429 2018-12-19 13:40:29 Clearly you dont understand that crypto is bigger than the internet, crypto is going to destroy central banks and SIFIs, and institutional investors are coming to pump crypto to the moon (remember that meme?) any second now

5459 2018-12-19 13:37:00 Woah I'm just asking if EOS has any anonymity features not trying to be a dick or unhelpful.  Anyway telling people to forget about their loans and buy crypto to hide is just plain irresponsible and not helpful at all to their situation at all
5460 2018-12-19 13:36:54 An exchange, in most cases, do not know what you are doing with your crypto once withdrawn. They legally have to have a default so everything is consistent on their end. Your responsibility is to report basis and adjusted basis.

5603 2018-12-19 13:21:56 no way of knowing - however, this could be a sign that crypto, in general, was oversold. US tax year ends this month + sentiment is improving.

Invest $1000 Bank interest 3% a year $1000 = $30 profit

Traditional stock market 6% a year $1000 = $60

Masternode example 250% a year $1000 = $2,500 profit (With Crypto this is possible)

- 85% correction (20 to 3k) , in line with the other crypto bear market correction levels.

- similar market structure and length of 2014 bear market.

5977 2018-12-19 12:48:10 The best way to lose this game is to chase a 20%+ pump.

6035 2018-12-19 12:43:03 Explains why the market is so irrational.  Pump and dumps centralize this.  Anti thetical to the bitcoin movement. Ignore this and ultimately be the one who is rekt.  If it doesn’t adhere to what makes it valuable(decentralized) then it’s worthless!
6036 2018-12-19 12:42:59 Nowhere in the IRS guidance does it say that transferring BTC between your own wallets or exchanges constitutes a sale. Selling BTC for fiat/other crypto or exchanging for goods and services is a sale and that needs to be reported.

6042 2018-12-19 12:42:31 All of that doesn’t work to the T in the near market so it’s almost useless. Crypto has no fundamental value and is backed by nothing, unlike Gold. So while using those tools to guess, it shouldn’t be relied upon.

6119 2018-12-19 12:34:51 @mappopk_crypto  new way
6120 2018-12-19 12:34:50 I had switched from @BittrexExchange to @binance for same reason of fees.
I had no issue with exchange.
Right now binance fees have also got heavy.
Again looking for some better options.
Low fees exchange is scalpers paradise.
6121 2018-12-19 12:34:36 great work
6122 2018-12-19 12:34:25 good way
6123 2018-12-19 12:34:05 Should be fine for this sort of thing, iops isn't a requirement

6155 2018-12-19 12:31:14 I'm not saying we'll reach ATH's but u cannot be so self righteous to completely disregard that it can happen. The same way the market could simply die by EOY too. 

This is crypto, unregulated & wild... Anything can happen and if you say otherwise, you're not fit to give advice.

6172 2018-12-19 12:29:41 それにしてもCDPでDai発行してると感覚がおかしくなる。
CDPの維持率が持たせられる限り、 年利2.5％(0.5％に下がる見込みもあり)で借りっぱなしに出来るという恐ろしい仕組み。

Dai借りてETH買ってそれを元にDai借りて…ETH値上がりで維持率UPしたり。
まあ流石に30とか40ドル行ったら辛いけど 笑
6173 2018-12-19 12:29:35 Any other 1000 ETH stacks lying around? I’ll give you a whole lot of ads back for that to promote in the crypto and/or dev space.

6176 2018-12-19 12:29:25 Without regulation institutional investment money will stay on the sidelines. When they are convinced the wild west days are over, they will help stabilize crypto and that will lead to wider adoption.

You don't need to be a genius to know that the audience of crypto/geek related subject is almost only men.
The lack of female reaction seems normal with that in mind.
6217 2018-12-19 12:24:05 The reason for lack of regulation for crypto in India can be attributed to the extreme fluctuations in the price of the Cryptowhich can lead to high losses instead of profits. Also the government fear that non-traceable and anonymous crypto might be used for funding terrorists.
6218 2018-12-19 12:23:59 MVNOって契約代行であって回線はメガキャリアと同じなんです。

6228 2018-12-19 12:22:45 why not 1,500 or 500?
6229 2018-12-19 12:22:45 Bull is just liquidity backed.
I don’t know anyone in my contact who wants to put money, they are just waiting for sell off as most of the stocks are trading at loss to them. This period is very similar to crypto, everyone wanted it to go up, but no one was putting. Crash severe

6266 2018-12-19 12:19:38 Coinbase supports XRP as part of its institutional efforts. Both companies are co-invested in some projects. I dont think anyone is working against retail investors. I think they are just working according to their strategies and the current "lay of the land". Things take time.
6267 2018-12-19 12:19:27 But definitely all crypto is subject to a lot of risks ....smaller and newer projects are even higher risk — there are lots of ways to attack this coin or any coin

6290 2018-12-19 12:16:29 I disagree in the fact that there is no real-life utilisation of #cryptocurrency. If you go to Venezuela you'll face the problem that you can't use any fiat currency given that the government audits everything. Thus, people have started using #crypto as a way to transfer value.

6501 2018-12-19 11:51:47 I agree on SCB, definately. But if they were so sure Catalyst are banks, he wouldn't have corrected himself when he was calling them banks.

Either way, we know Catalyst and SCB are using or going to use $XRP and that's already 1 true bank at least. We'll hear more next year.

6534 2018-12-19 11:47:45 Remember in the UK everyone gets ~11k tax free, to start. Make good use of that! Then its 10% tax if you're a basic-rate payer, up to a certain amount. 20% after that. There are ways to make realizing gains more efficient – obviously get a GOOD accountant who knows about crypto!

6673 2018-12-19 11:29:12 I do this for a living. I was trained by a former federal IRS agent (my dad). Every tax payer may find themselves is various circumstances due to if then, and if else situations. But one thing is for sure, if you move crypto from an exchange, the default must be sale/proceed.

6678 2018-12-19 11:28:55 Do you know ? When bitcoin, etherium or ripple is born, it has a lot of promising features and the crypto
 community has high hopes until we start to see some flaws. That is why the #nexty of the project has appeared
6679 2018-12-19 11:28:34 #Brexit How much does #EU pay shills like #LBC tax-dodger #JamesOBrien? 1975 #EUref was implemented. 2016 #PeoplesVote must be too. That's #democracy! #ProjectFear doesn't scare us. Who'd vote to join the anti-democratic, crypto-fascist EU today?! #StandUp4Brexit #LeaveMeansLeave
6680 2018-12-19 11:28:31 I think BTC , ETH .. will be replaced by #Nexty platform.  Although it is a new electronic currency,but it has received a lot of attention from the international community. 
It deserves to be the electronic currency of the future with zero transfer fees #crypto
6681 2018-12-19 11:28:30 Done 
6682 2018-12-19 11:28:22 Santa's delivering a few more price drops for Christmas this year & in place of coal our crypto stockings will be filled with rekt.

6933 2018-12-19 10:53:46 Na habt ihr euch schon fürs neue Jahr vorgenommen endlich eurer Crypto zu verkaufen weil es nur noch wie ein schwerer Stein daliegt?
6934 2018-12-19 10:53:39 ppl still give this guy credit for his crypto knowledge.
6935 2018-12-19 10:53:29 On voit très exactement la même chose dans la scène hacktiviste, la scène crypto-anar, et crypto-libertarienne.

Deux formes de cyber-impérialisme fasciste qui s'affrontent. Et l'anarchie et la crypto-anarchie dans tout ça, et bien il ne reste plus grand chose.
6936 2018-12-19 10:53:20 I'll say... Crypto is for smart people... You wouldn't get it.

6939 2018-12-19 10:52:27 "Do your research, it's all available on the internet". Means I don't fucking know what I am talking about for :

- crypto
- conspiracy theories
- inexistant scandals 

And popscience, but this is good even though misleading.

Birb has called $3k the entire year, shorted the thing the entire year and made a killing.
Even IF he opened new shorts at $3.6k he probably either took profit and went long or lost a % or 2 max with a stop loss.

Japan plans to officially name Crypto as "Crypto Assets".

Crypto is seen as an asset and not a official currency. There's no threat, just wealth creation.

7183 2018-12-19 10:15:36 Crypto has been slow to start but 10 years in the narrative feels similar - how to monetize, scalabilty is an issue and how to get use cases to the masses.  Lets judge it 17 years from now and see how we go ;-)

7186 2018-12-19 10:15:02 Yeah but took a very long time for people to accept paper money over metal coins. I think crypto may still take the public quite some time. I think Ripple’s ‘go for the backend’ strategy is very wise.

7200 2018-12-19 10:13:16 @Bitfinexed The idea they don't have the funds seems like a red herring. They probably have the funds. The issue is *where* they got them from. Deltec was recently involved in a multi-bn $ Venezuelan money laundering op. This smells more like a Liberty Reserve sequel.
7201 2018-12-19 10:13:10 I lost the sale of their crypto in ICO they had recently, ask when they will place it in the exchenger for sale to all public and there to buy, because I lost the opportunity, but I want to invest in its crypto.

7271 2018-12-19 10:02:40 I'm not that bothered by it really. They are one of two fiat on-ramps I use into crypto trading. Coinbase doesn't list XRP, but the other does.

7359 2018-12-19 09:49:12 Really apparent that these ‘crypto influencers’ do nothing but shill investment because they have investments. They don’t recognize that Bitcoin is supposed to be peer to peer electronic money, not an investment. Fools. #Bitcoin #cryptocurrency #cypherpunks @nixops #crypto

7362 2018-12-19 09:48:46 Yes. I agree. There is this common thing in crypto community and in general too. People think stock market crash will be good for crypto and I disagree.
7363 2018-12-19 09:48:45 Twitter is quite what?
7364 2018-12-19 09:48:38 Not related. That’s why it is a question. Remember that 800 billion is still out there in someone’s pocket and can enter at anytime. It’s just the game. I think it is positive that crypto goes up when the rest dump. It’s a lot of money entering anyways in a short period of time.

7431 2018-12-19 09:38:21 Coincidentally these also have very good fundamentals, which already tells a lot about the market: absolutely nothing has changed, it hasn't matured, stuff will pump no matter the quality of a project and crypto is still the biggest financial opportunity of our lifetime.
7432 2018-12-19 09:38:04 Good idea. I'm not falling for it either. Looks like a fakeout. I am however positioning more and more capital to throw into crypto when I believe is the right time.

7434 2018-12-19 09:38:00 I was refering to noobs in ethereum staking. Like ordinary people interested in crypto but not at developer level. Running secured hardware should not be so complicated that could not be learned in few months time, provided that there is some guidance published for that purpose.

7438 2018-12-19 09:37:01 I don't care how much crypto pumps up. It's going to go down really hard soon. There are zero reasons, fundamentals for it to hold $124 billion. If anything it's confirming my suspicions. When the stock market crash finally hits full effect. Crypto will grow. Give it time.
7439 2018-12-19 09:36:58 Not related at all, the % of money entering the crypto market (excluding OTC for which we cannot know accurately) is miniscule compared to the outflow in the stock markets

7511 2018-12-19 09:24:58 My honourable friend,to be honest with you,at this time and for the next 4-6 months I’m not worrying about super low prices. All we who is deep in Crypto should expect this to happen. The more we rely on Crypto,the more difficult is to take this low prices. Guys be independent

7517 2018-12-19 09:24:07 Now that people can't buy crypto with credit cards anymore, I sometimes question if the next bull run will be as aggressive in terms of its parabolic nature

7519 2018-12-19 09:23:32 One of the problems investing in a volatile market is that in the course of a simple train ride home you can lose what you make in a week, but over a decade the potential for payoff is larger than your current historical earnings working 9-5 #crypto #hodl
7520 2018-12-19 09:23:05 U do know that traders can actualy buy crypto 24/7 right i mean who sleeps at night who is trading btc 
7521 2018-12-19 09:22:52 I can’t say coinbase because we know their position about XRP. However, I am confuse regarding Binance. I don’t know what is Binance position about XRP. The day XRP will be base crypto on Binance, I will answer this question.
7522 2018-12-19 09:22:46   some people are still waiting for $ 1500
7523 2018-12-19 09:22:02 The friction that you’re talking is a limitation of current infrastructure, and DEXes will solve the problem. What “unnecessary” currency does is it allows new business models to emerge

7913 2018-12-19 08:20:12 Very informative @maenqt ... more recently Initial Coin Offering (ICO) emerged as a form of crowd funding, using the crypto and blockchain technologies. Which basically rewards you with coins that will “hopefully” will be worth more in case the service takes off.

7958 2018-12-19 08:13:23 There was euphoria in crypto which took the place of what we usually see in small caps. The charts of the FAANG stocks and their ilk very clearly demonstrate euphoria and blow off tops. It may not have felt like broad euphoria but it was there

7989 2018-12-19 08:07:00 The biggest problem of all financial crashes was that people didn't have nothing else to chose. Now people can left old fiat system and never come back. Bitcoin can really make very big shock to the world economy, but it is inevitable.
7990 2018-12-19 08:06:49 You've made a lot of errors in what you are saying.

Most fiat currencies cannot be manipulated "anytime in any way". They are strictly regulated and monitored, both nationally and internationally.

You think manipulating crypto is hard due to "rules"?

8015 2018-12-19 08:02:33 I would wait for further confirmation, If 3k is the bottom then I would expect some consolidation above that level and maybe even a capitulative wick before going for another run. About the fundamentals I dont think Bitcoin is dead, many other crypto projects are.

8110 2018-12-19 07:46:40 Always take your coins of exchanges not only on jan. 3 , the whole point with crypto is to be your own bank and detach yourself from the corrupt and failing fiat system, use a @LedgerHQ @Trezor etc. to store your #BTC and #DGB

8113 2018-12-19 07:46:12 Why trust on fiat that can be manipulated by its creators anytime in any way while crypto has much stricter rules making manipulation less easy?

8450 2018-12-19 06:46:06 ソフトバンクIPOのことをハードフォークって呼ぶのはなんかわろた。
8451 2018-12-19 06:46:03 Actualmente exciten mas de 1200 #cripto , y Venezuela le abrió las puertas legalmente a todas ellas, yo personalmente siempre me inclinare a usar la que tenga menor fee, que tenga mayor velocidad de transacción como @Bitcore_BTX , el fee del BTC son muy alto!. no vale la pena.
8452 2018-12-19 06:46:00 I thought the idea of crypto was to get Wall Street to buy retail traders bags?
8453 2018-12-19 06:45:58 そっちはVertCoinだな。ライトコインに引き続き耐ASICを目的として作られた通貨だ。ASICはより強固なセキュリティを得るのに良い方法なんだが、如何せん一般人の参入障壁になってしまってな。セキュアを犠牲にして参入障壁を取っ払っているぞ。グラボがあれば誰でも掘れる。
8454 2018-12-19 06:45:42 たまーになら良いけどねw

8455 2018-12-19 06:45:24 That's exactly correct, shame people are too scared to correctly"work" the crypto world to properly make money which is why they got into crypto to begin with lol.. good words of advice my fellow crypto like minded friend.

8468 2018-12-19 06:44:01 Not useful to me nor other colleagues and friends...we eant to invest in XRP. Why? Because its technical data sheet is way better than the one of other crypto assets, let alone Bitcoin...

8471 2018-12-19 06:43:36 In crypto it’s an indicator that they still have a hard time accepting conventions that work for society and aren’t the best possible technological solution to a problem (not that crypto is).

8476 2018-12-19 06:42:53 Fair enough. I do think this company does offer improvement for people who earn crypto or just want to sell crypto they have. Instead of having to sell through an exchange then pay your bill. You just sell it to them, and they pay your bill.

8479 2018-12-19 06:42:17 The real mind-virus of crypto is public key cryptography. 

Diffie + Hellman took crypto out of the NSA by inventing it, but RSA patented it and turned it corporate. Zimmermann infringed the patent into PGP and an internet open source community formed around it: the cypherpunks.

8518 2018-12-19 06:35:17 Well the extreme case is crypto but I think that's far to volitle and not mainstream enough for most to use including me. But that might be the only answer or maybe just mailing check or something to account which has lots of issue with that lol.

8547 2018-12-19 06:30:04 Dear @arunjaitley 

Japan plans to officially name Crypto as "Crypto Assets".

It's a matter of time before every country starts using this term

Crypto is seen as an asset and not a official currency. There's no threat, just wealth creation.

Let's wake up! #IndiaWantsCrypto

その意味では、BFみたいに1ポジに対して証拠金も倍いるし、1ポジしかポジれないしSLが滑るBFはまったくメリットがないよ。

8586 2018-12-19 06:24:21 Look Kieran, I’m happy to accept an apology from her, just don’t think it’s right in what’ll soon be 2019 that men have to face shocking sexism, she’s a clever lady, I’m sure she’ll realise just how sexist and out of touch it was.

8698 2018-12-19 06:08:00 Good question. My feeling is this rate rise is too small to have a direct impact on crypto prices, since they're far removed. 

Broader, quantitative tightening could be playing a role though.

8947 2018-12-19 05:31:05 I think that in 2019, the electronic currency has superior technology, practical applications will be more known and strong growth. Nexty Platform (NTY) with Instant transfer, Zero transfer fees, it is fully deserves the money of the future #crypto #nexty #bitcoin #nty
8948 2018-12-19 05:31:03 I think there are some triggers for next year early crypto spring. $ETH is getting his update, bakkt is released, the final ETF decision is coming, the Europe government is pro crypto, the sec is talking more positive about icos, and at last: bottom was never what all expected
8949 2018-12-19 05:30:51 A Cross-Chain is a much needed tool in this Crypto Space. The difference is #OCN is creating their protocol to first connect w/ #TRX.

8962 2018-12-19 05:29:54 Bitfinex and Tether have a long history of making up the rules as they go along and shitting on retail traders.  I could say that for just about every crypto exchange, though.

9094 2018-12-19 05:14:18 Pity. Step by step I guess. Great to see CZ and the team continuing to push forward regardless. I’m bias as I live here but I’m extra excited by any developments taking place for the crypto ecosystem here in Singapore / Southeast Asia.

9106 2018-12-19 05:12:15 It’s not a Hail Mary but completely rational for them. If Bitcoin is the only winner in crypto, and buy+HODL BTC becomes consensus wisdom, then their business model is utterly decimated. 

Bitcoin alone winning is an extinction-level-event.

Survival mode is rational.

9156 2018-12-19 05:02:39 "Prominent" people in crypto are starting to turn their backs. The bear market has taken its toll. True believers are digging in. 

Last time we saw this was around the time Mike Hern left Bitcoin. We all know what happened next.

This feels familiar and this feels good!

9158 2018-12-19 05:02:06 @kittiefightHQ Might be wondering why would someone euthanize precious non-fungibles? Well it boils down to risk-taking in a crypto-economically incentivized game, where the corresponding payoffs outweighs the risk of losing a kittie that is not costlier than the reward/payof

9161 2018-12-19 05:01:51 In my own opinion! @bitcoin_token Btk will be the greatest crypto in coming 2019! You know why? Because #BTK have alot of members, many market to trade, great dev team, active social media, and many more! Thats why i buy it. Then wait for the right time!
9162 2018-12-19 05:01:43 “Stable Coins” like Tether or USDC seem to be the most logical crypto for everyday use. Not fun to invest in or hold if it’s pegged to USD, but it appears most people are not interested in using Bitcoin as a currency. Bitcoin is likely digital gold.
9163 2018-12-19 05:01:38 Not sure where the crypto world is heading in 2019, but I always warned people not to invest in ICOs given that there are no securities commissions in the crypto world.

9224 2018-12-19 04:51:57 Wow. At first I thought that guy is some crypto grifter. Didn’t realize he’s a freaking US congressman...
9225 2018-12-19 04:51:45 Ask yourself.
In 10+ years, will the crypto market be above an 80-100B total MC? (now)

Take into account all rapidly advancing tech. Take into account what top stock exchanges are doing. Take into account the great depression/every bear market after. Where are we? Higher.

9420 2018-12-19 04:19:40 Green is nice when it lasts and then cements the bull market.

People see green and sell at these levels, but realize you've traded your 89% loss for an 80% loss, 

But in a green market...you can call that +9% trade the worst decision you'll ever make. #bullish #tron
9421 2018-12-19 04:19:33 Okay, down to brass tacks:
We need to recognize that the enemies of crypto are undoubtedly the enemies of freedom (and probably of humanity in general).

9434 2018-12-19 04:17:16 Dear @arunjaitley 

Japan plans to officially name Crypto as "Crypto Assets".

It's a matter of time before every country starts using this term

Crypto is seen as an asset and not a official currency. There's no threat, just wealth creation.

9473 2018-12-19 04:10:21 Exactly. Kate has a history of complaining about white males and the "patriachy" but she's often condesending and rude towards anyone who doesn't share her viewpoint.

9493 2018-12-19 04:07:07 Crypto WILL solve the issue of debt. Lemme explain with Bitcoin, the government uses words like 'quantitative easing' and print more money, which results inflation (in a crude manner).
Bitcoin's supply remains constant and its price is set by the demand n supply = public.

9501 2018-12-19 04:06:15 fomo betting? the bear market will crush many for a while. but at some point it will end and the fomo buying will, as per the past 10 years of crypto history, return.

9508 2018-12-19 04:05:17 @philthatremains I know nothing about crypto.. so where does it get it's value? I know i could just google it, but you talk about it frequently

9520 2018-12-19 04:03:37 This isn’t what we are talking about.  My statement is that crypto will probably not solve the issues of debt.  

Sell coins at the top = more money = no debt

Are you suggesting that the more money one has , the less debt they have ?
9521 2018-12-19 04:03:37 Bahaha your first response was fine. I decided not to even point out how you admitted your previous tweet calling out Steez was wrong. Then you said this trash. I havent changed my count. We hit my targets perfectly. Meanwhile we pushed above your "b" termination.

9523 2018-12-19 04:02:57 Their main argument also is price like what if this hits $100. Ripple forgets for the longest time of the alt run last year it was sucking wind until the start of December. I remember I had some (like $10 why not) and followed it.

プラスというか、入れ替えですね、BTCの使っている果物がリンゴなら、ZCoinがこれから使う果物はみかん(MTP)で、今までみかん使った暗号資産は無かったということです。

というより、MTPを新しく考案したわけですので、果物の新種を開発したという方が正しい例えかもしれません

9591 2018-12-19 03:53:47 When bitcoin currency is converted from currency into cash, that interface has to remain under some regulatory safeguards. I think the fact that within the bitcoin universe an algorithm replaces the function of the government[that] is actually pretty cool.

9622 2018-12-19 03:48:33 Do you have any information that validates any of your claims? I’m all up for listening, but to be honest, all I’ve seen from XRP army up to now is desperate people who need it to go to five hundred dollars within a few hours of it pumping properly
9623 2018-12-19 03:48:24 False. Garlinghouse will flip the switch and activate the new tech which will initiate the next bull run. The tech (at least for ONE cryptocurrency) will be there

9652 2018-12-19 03:43:30 I keep seeing people asking the same questions about crypto? Knowing what the true answer really is.
Some ask ... "When is the next crypto bull run going to happen..."?
" ...When will crypto be accepted as a form of payment..."?

9658 2018-12-19 03:42:01 Never felt more confident about Crypto relevance.  Even with this small bounce you can see it doesn’t take much to get the money flowing back in.  It’s not new money but it certainly capable of attracting new money.
9659 2018-12-19 03:41:56 Stick to crypto & chainblock
9660 2018-12-19 03:41:53 Crypto is in it’s IP pre DNS phase or its Mosaic pre Netscape phase. It’s been slow, usable only to more tech knowledgeable users v “mom&pop”. It’s a realistic endeavor that will take years of psychological change for us to adapt to but the benefits are there.

9751 2018-12-19 03:29:20 値幅にして約17%なわけだが
9752 2018-12-19 03:29:07 Not to be obnoxious, but I think "sound money" is way over played in Crypto, it relies on convincing others on your perspective. People have shown they don't care much about the soundness of money for the most part.
9753 2018-12-19 03:28:54 Let gets something straight. Yeah the technology is cute and all but this run that we are going to have when we reverse is not going to wait for the “Tech” to catch up. Greed doesn’t care about your blockchain. Greed cares about greed & we are going to run regardless of the Tech
9754 2018-12-19 03:28:51 値幅でいうと大したことない上に普通に考えたらリスキーすぎる..って事は、普通に考えてわからない力とか何かしらがあるんだなあ...想像つかないレベルのLOTだったり情報だったり動かす力だったり...
9755 2018-12-19 03:28:50 運営上の理由で利確？
利確したからって売りが終わるわけではないし依然として守備力強く！
9756 2018-12-19 03:28:41 WHY:

1. When BTC is rising @binance is $30 lower than everyone else?
2. When BTC is falling @binance is $100 higher than everyone else?

9757 2018-12-19 03:28:36 It's a fair implication to me. A hedge fund manager saying he closed it now before it goes to zero just bcuz he didn't want to think about it? BS
9758 2018-12-19 03:28:33 Will there be any retracement for BTC at 3900? Or do we hit 4200 before retracing.

9772 2018-12-19 03:26:48 There are plenty out there who assume that it will happen that way again with crypto simply because "world history shows" it has happened before with legacy assets.  Things seem different enough this time for that to not be a foregone conclusion.
9773 2018-12-19 03:26:48 I’ve been researching about XRP, I see all the partnerships but my concern is that they don’t use the XRP token, or even Ripple labs at all?

If that doesn’t happen, it has a terribly high market cap when compared to other coins with a good future like ICX or even DRGN
9774 2018-12-19 03:26:42 Their foreheads. The old servant Katoda came out, and kept himself at the Palace. #twitterbot #crypto #cryptocurrency #bitcoin #ethereum

9776 2018-12-19 03:26:38 Low interest rates will continue to push investors further out on the risk curve.

In traditional markets, this means money moving from bonds to high yield credit to equities.

In crypto, this means money moving from bitcoin to altcoins.

Same search for yield, same bad ending.
9777 2018-12-19 03:26:30 Really good...

9780 2018-12-19 03:26:19 To be clear I’m not recommending any, just passing along info. Most of these new exchanges will fail, the big boys have a huge leg up
9781 2018-12-19 03:26:14 One should never forget all the bugs that happened in several exchange plateforms during last bull run because of traffic overload. I prefer pay more and care less, better safe than sorry
9782 2018-12-19 03:26:13 すごいね。
9783 2018-12-19 03:26:04 The exchange I generally trust (Gemini) is far too expensive to trade on.

9792 2018-12-19 03:24:33 $crypto went up 20% these few days. Do crypto traders know something stock traders don’t?  Fed about to print again? Yeah sooner or later. Let hyperinflation begin. $Gold and $crypto will shine.
9793 2018-12-19 03:24:29 That’s absolutely insane, there are some places like that in England also. Little pockets that have their own little economy because the demand is so high

9796 2018-12-19 03:24:13 this totally didn't happen, why did you retweet it? lol
9797 2018-12-19 03:24:11 pretty sad how bad unregulated exchanges are between market fees "server overload" and other fuckery. definitely the weak link in the crypto chain.
9798 2018-12-19 03:24:07 XRPはコインベースの件で上げてるんか、忘れてたわ
9799 2018-12-19 03:24:04 Stock up on xrp will be worth it once all the banks start moving trillions across border payments
9800 2018-12-19 03:23:58 Yes, It's kinda hard to tall as ten years ago there were none of them. But I'm hoping crypto will get stronger during that time as an alternative investment and "asset" purchase power 
9801 2018-12-19 03:23:55 Ben Shapiro is taking Savages slot?  I can't stand that crypto neocon.

9805 2018-12-19 03:22:57 While this indicator doesn't align w/ my trading style, as #Crypto does not suffer from Close/Open as it is continuous, and the futures market is still largely institutional, it doesn't hurt to stay educated on other methods should new potential developments arise. #Crypto #Trade
9806 2018-12-19 03:22:56 Yeah I agree, I really feel that the bottom is in. And I’m certainly hoping so, I’m buying good alts while I still can at these prices
9807 2018-12-19 03:22:51 @kin_foundation thee best crypto currency around an instant buy in my opinion .00000030 is well worth it and it’s owned by @Kik
9808 2018-12-19 03:22:49 If all you look at is price, sure....it went down with the rest  of crypto projects. Wish the best of luck.

Now stop hijacking a thread where we are giving out LBC to loyal users...the only thing that matters long term in any project.

9810 2018-12-19 03:22:40 So ETH broke 100$. What next now?

I am grateful I followed you
9811 2018-12-19 03:22:36 Other areas might crash but I doubt it will happen in my area.  I live in Silicon Valley and a crappy burnt down home sold for $900k last year.  Nothing but a wall left on the land.
9812 2018-12-19 03:22:35 Maybe? That's a question best answered by @needacoin, he's the one fucking this goat, I'm just holding the horns
9813 2018-12-19 03:22:30  I guess I should start hedging a bit that this won’t just turnaround and tank. 
9814 2018-12-19 03:22:26 This Christmas I asked santa to give me 1 BTC .
He said crypto is a scam it's fake money . It doesn't exist.
At that moment Santa knew he fucked up
YOU DON'T EXIST!!

9822 2018-12-19 03:20:59 It's so fun to be long bitcoin when it's pumping from the lows I think I'm going to get euphoric now so I hold longer than prudent risk management and watch it keeping going up.
9823 2018-12-19 03:20:56 Hahaha 
9824 2018-12-19 03:20:51 I figured that was it. Appreciate the response man! Nice trade!

9868 2018-12-19 03:16:34 That is explained in the video. You do not buy the crypto till you wish to pay for something and the person you pay immediately converts it into whatever fiat currency they want. No value is lost because you are holding onto the crypto for a few minutes at most.

9875 2018-12-19 03:15:38 This is an inherant problem for crypto. One should consider reporting as a sale the market value at the time of the move. The exchanges can only  report to IRS information they have.  If you fully reflect all activities from an exchange, you will satisfy IRS.

9880 2018-12-19 03:14:47 What if Wall Street has been buying while the market is low and not exactly manipulating so much since crypto is global? What if they’ve been in a buying frenzy trying to HODL as much as possible like us waiting for the bulls?
9881 2018-12-19 03:14:41 Looking at you @coinbase. You sneaky little thieving SOBs. CT and hopefully the general public soon enough are aware of your ridiculous “fees.” Knock it off. I’m rooting for @cz_binance.

Minority groups might not have the numbers to win an election but, they have disproportional impact and power to spread the word. 

Someone who is pro drug, anti-big tech and all things crypto works.
9907 2018-12-19 03:11:13 With that said, all that could easily play out and then proceed back into a hard downtrend once it's reached.  Until we get back above $5,800 I won't be completely confident that the worst is over.  Still think if we go sub 3k it'll wick out quickly.

9911 2018-12-19 03:10:48 Does this change your stance on no crypto until 2020 or reassessing?
9912 2018-12-19 03:10:42 You can’t buy crypto with $ and sell $ to your bank on Binance therefore we need them both

9923 2018-12-19 03:09:29 "...profitable businesses with growing customers..." you totally didn´t understand for what crypto stands! Crypto is not all these shitty ICOs and shitcoins floating around. Diminishing the crypto space and everyone involved is flat out disrespectful.

9926 2018-12-19 03:09:00 Yeah. In that case ABC the A and C legs are impulsive because they move in the direction of the trend. While the ABC is corrective wrt HTF trend.
Waves move IN THE DIRECTION of the trend within the same trend are called iMPULSIVE. That is definition.

9936 2018-12-19 03:07:15 Even if it was crypto, they would still be able to trace. All transactions are online. To do anything useful you still have to go thru KYC/AML

9945 2018-12-19 03:05:18 Yep, that’s why I’m saying the only option is a local dealer. OCS doesn’t take crypto.
9946 2018-12-19 03:05:00 That doesn't need crypto it needs mobile banking and payment system
9947 2018-12-19 03:04:46 @tradingroomapp  sir i think we have a new personality here adding a lots of value which can be shared among large audience.
9948 2018-12-19 03:04:27 Sounds like you’re a smart guy. Give it 5 years and we’ll likely be aiming to rotate Bitcoin gains back in to cheap property during the next housing crash

9963 2018-12-19 03:02:43 Today's theme: Sell too early.

Today I had a 4 day trade open on $BNB and sold a little too early because it gained another 4% - but - I loaded it into $XLM which had more runway and jumped 8-10%.

Closed both out which provided 2 & 3 Friday's from now's paycheck.

9964 2018-12-19 03:02:41 I fully agree, the beauty will all be apparent in the end. Right before our eyes we have a future Titan or a blockchain company, with a smaller market cap than Dentacoin  we even lost more of a % than Tittiecoin
