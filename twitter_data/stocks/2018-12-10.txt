2 2018-12-10 23:58:49 Let me translate #BearMarket it’s when your stocks lose all your contributions since May and your investment advisor says to hold them longer, it’s just a bump. 
Remember, they take their cut first. You get what’s left.
3 2018-12-10 23:58:11 I think the stocks went out of favour much too soon. Line these self aggrandising buggers up and pass me the rotten eggs.
4 2018-12-10 23:57:23 @timothysykes question: I notice sometimes you’ll trade stocks not on your watch list based off their price action, are you solely finding these using the stocks to trade scanners? Or something else? New challenge student- loving the DVD’s and grinding!
5 2018-12-10 23:57:17 I took some stocks off of Ally's annoying ass snake, that makes me top 100 at least, right.
6 2018-12-10 23:57:15 On CNBC, these FastMoney & Halftime TV Traders are a disgrace for investors, the shows shouldn't even be legal. EVERY ONE OF THESE TV TRADERS WERE BULLISH & PUSHING STOCKS AT $SPX 2940. & AFTER WE SLID TO SPX 2600, they are scared mice in a snake pit...that is clueless advice
7 2018-12-10 23:57:12 I'm not. Would be fun though. Based on stocks reaction past two weeks it feels like it's being held up. It's so strong. Someone is accumulating imho

10 2018-12-10 23:55:50 This is a day for stupid headlines: “Stocks End in the Black Because Yo-Yos Go Up, Too.” This is why I don’t subscribe to Barrons anymore.
11 2018-12-10 23:55:44 high speed quick matches is what i want , quick stocks so people learn to counterplay them and we have higher stock and more exciting matches. i don't want characters to be overpowered, but i also don't want decent characters to be nerfed just bc ppl don't know how to fight them
12 2018-12-10 23:54:18 Crypto "nutjobs" sound a lot like the gold/oil/biotech etc "nutjobs". Emotional, anxious, gamblers. Low IQ.

Crypto "naysayers" sound like bank analysts who build 5k line valuation models on stocks that often collapse. Low EQ.

17 2018-12-10 23:50:36 When someone says the business cycle has been moderated if not eliminated, I fear we are heading into a recession.  And slowing growth, dropping stocks, multiple trade wars, and inverting yield curves suggest we have cause for concern.

40 2018-12-10 23:50:04 12/10 Consumer discretionary stocks which include Disney, Nike, Amazon were down last week.   As a group they are still up 5% for year, but down  7% in last six months.  I'm avoiding these stocks until there is a better read on the USA economy.   World economies are in decline.

46 2018-12-10 23:44:11 The stocks are under pressure even if the price go up
47 2018-12-10 23:44:09 I wouldn't say 'without reason'. Blizzard is looking to cut costs across the board. Activision stocks have practically halved in value post-Blizzcon. HGC makes an easy target.
48 2018-12-10 23:43:26 Selloff until the fed announcement. I think stocks short term go higher if they want to raise once more next week. They need calmness....

52 2018-12-10 23:41:47 I didn't think Inkling would have this much potential with so many options. I didn't think 3 stocks would last so long with the whole 1v1 system now, but at least it's worthwhile.

55 2018-12-10 23:39:35 I don't think it would be accurate to say the United States government deliberately provided seed stocks to the Iraqis' biological weapons programs,'' said Jonathan Tucker, a former U.N. biological weapons inspector.
56 2018-12-10 23:39:20 Inkling is crazy. Also, I'm gonna make a new room real quick because i underestimated how long 3 stocks is

71 2018-12-10 23:31:28 Why don't you just resign.  You have made our country into a swamp.  The stocks are down, companies are closing, other countries are laughing at us because of you, you are getting rid of all plans to save the  water, air. Crops are rotting, you are against media, all institutions
72 2018-12-10 23:31:14 Pot stocks and CBD were the hits of 2018. We've beginning to understand biology better. 5 years ago if you asked people what the top 3 healthiest foods were they wouldn't know the answer. They're all animal products, organ meat, shellfish, and fatty fish. This is the beginning.

74 2018-12-10 23:27:49 To be ironic it has to have an unexpected result. Turning 98 and then dying the day after you win the lottery isn't unexpected. He's fucking 98. The first person to be sentenced to wooden stocks was the man who invented it. Now that's irony.
75 2018-12-10 23:26:34 Russia u need to stop their source of wealth, which is from poor African countries. Support these countries to truly be independent, n France,  UK, n Spain, shall be global laughing stocks.

80 2018-12-10 23:24:13 Markets are up? Trump is a genius economist who deserves all the credit. Stocks plummet? Trump isn’t responsible for the stock market.  Was the reverse for @BarackObama : Up no credit. Down all the blame.

Once you get these handled you can start looking into the many ways to invest (Roth IRA, Stocks, Real Estate, etc) make your money work for you

91 2018-12-10 23:13:51 IDK if I’m just lucky or not? But Quickplay for me has been absolutely amazing. Played against people with like-minded rules and only a couple of times had the rules change from 7 minutes to 6 minutes. All three stocks.

Quickplay is the future. Also Elite lmao

93 2018-12-10 23:12:29 U.S. stocks closed modestly higher Monday after an afternoon turnaround that followed a deep dive into negative territory. Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted more than 500 points after PM May Theresa May announced that the Parliamentary vote  on Brexit was being delayed

100 2018-12-10 23:06:56 I believe that All politicians have had their day. For lying and deceiving they should be put in the stocks and given to the people. Save your spuds and rotten fruit, the only thing they now deserve.
101 2018-12-10 23:06:46 How did you make out with "Buy until #TreasuryCurveInversion, still have 18-months before stocks rollover"? "After last #Fed hike, re-test old highs"..

109 2018-12-10 22:59:52 It's good to make those observations. If you have enough and could quantify the result you might have a leading indicator. Preferably you use some tool to do that. 

I don't know about btc but when it comes to stocks it's usually the opposite since they usually build up momentum.
110 2018-12-10 22:58:10 Yes.. i just mean in general.. both teams are laughing stocks. That will surely continue. Thats like watching Browns fans argue winning vs Bills fans
111 2018-12-10 22:58:06 OMG! This is just insane - you guys have such great imaginations! Love those stocks and the PVC dress. And that is a serious amount of goo you are covered in. Thank you again.x

121 2018-12-10 22:54:35 Tip for new traders: Always be aware of the volume and tape on a stock. If you see huge bids/offers getting taken out like butter, then you are going against SMART money. Those 20k share prints aren't robinhood traders lol... Know your competition and know which stocks to avoid!

127 2018-12-10 22:48:25 You'll know the same goes locally. The huge super vessels that suck the fish out of the sea are the enemy of the small fishermen and many are owned by Peterhead and Fraserburgh fishermen. Let's also remember that Canada fished its stocks to near extinction. No EU involved there.
128 2018-12-10 22:46:34 The british Elite like her.......rich socialists with their heated toilet seats have to be called out. Bob geldof telling british fishermen to fuk off because they were mad at other countries coming in and raping their fish stocks.

131 2018-12-10 22:45:57 I remember in  '87 there was a scare and then what seemed a recovery as everyone piled back in .

I'm a bull LT. There's going to be plenty of time to buy stocks . People who don't understand markets want everything resolved now.

This is a period of adjustment

138 2018-12-10 22:40:49 "Stocks closed higher Monday as major indexes bounced back from earlier losses as renewed confidence in the strength of the U.S. economy offset lingering worries over the U.S.-China trade dispute."

See that Dems, "confidence in the Trump economy."
139 2018-12-10 22:40:47 So many variables can used or found to make a perfectly well argued point for small-caps to underperform - How about more risk-aversion for high-beta, volatile stocks like small-caps?
140 2018-12-10 22:40:25 As expected #stocks #Dowjones #DJI closed under the support trend line since 2016. 2019 will confirm bear market and maybe crash

158 2018-12-10 22:33:13 In the current financial system, securities (stocks, bonds, derivatives) are continually 'double spent.' -- rehypothecation

Effectively, shares are 'printed out of thin air'

161 2018-12-10 22:31:21 I need Elon to do some wild shit again so I can cop these Tesla stocks
162 2018-12-10 22:31:04 Stop saying stocks are so cheap on a forward basis. Still pricey on a trailing basis, and never forget, earnings estimates can be very wrong.  Earnings estimates were 40% too high at the start of 2008.
163 2018-12-10 22:30:49 Sea stock. Cup a clump in your hands a breath deep, the perfume like other 'stocks'.
164 2018-12-10 22:30:41 Wall Street ended Monday's volatile session slightly higher with help from technology stocks although bank stocks tumbled and uncertainty over Britain's exit from the European Union kept investors on edge about global growth.
165 2018-12-10 22:30:30 Yes they are. Stocks have more than 1 owner. Check the Dole Foods case....
166 2018-12-10 22:30:19 So for awhile there I was going to trade stocks. But I think I’ll stick with currencies. They are more of my flavor.

168 2018-12-10 22:28:55 Agree income is most of it. But mortgage rate has dropped a lot so that must also be taken into account.

Sentiment seems v bearish on US resi real estate from what I see on Twitter.

In contrast, regarded as a truism that “you can’t go wrong w stocks in the (not so) long run”.

171 2018-12-10 22:27:53 True. And stocks are waaaaaay over-valued and sectors are adjusting. It’s scary as all get out, but imo, the stock prices have been inflated for awhile. Worth keeping an eye on, but a bit too soon to declare skullduggery.

177 2018-12-10 22:23:03 The average stock lost over 20% last time around. Put another way, over 50% of stocks hit the technical bear definition. Its arbitrary anyway, but it seems like what you are getting at. Indexes are weighted so levels just above technical bear don't tell the full story
178 2018-12-10 22:22:53 i think its more of a question is how long will stocks stay 15% down? Low prices will attract buyers

195 2018-12-10 22:12:56 @business @Bloomberg  - too much exaggeration and sensationalism for some time now. I just read a headline on the site stating that today "stocks roar back" --- up 0.14%  0.17% and 0.74% --- more of a #Meow than a #roar, I'd say - #stock #rally

265 2018-12-10 21:36:05 It is not being drawn that is the excess production which goes to storage which is effectively unavailable to the market. Stocks will only draw down 135kbpd to maintain the maximum amount available to the market.  It is comparing what is available to the market and what is not.
266 2018-12-10 21:35:17 “U.S. Stocks Widen Global Lead”
267 2018-12-10 21:34:35 1/ Once again stocks recovered and closed up after what looked like another bloody day on the open. So that's encouraging. But Even though we have some very favorable transits taking effect right now, we aren't seeing any up trend, #BTC is flat.
268 2018-12-10 21:34:15 I'm wondering where #Gold fits into this story. Might this be a good foundation for a resumption of the secular bull in 2019? Just heard an interview from the guys at @caseyresearch predicting a 22% rally for 2019 amid a continued choppiness for #stocks.
269 2018-12-10 21:34:08 I GOT A GAME WITH HAZARDS ON 4 PLAYER (TEAMS)  FULL ITEMS 7 MINS NO STOCKS LMAOOOO love how i get this when i choose 3 stock 5 min 1v1 xd xd xd
270 2018-12-10 21:32:58 It remains a mystery as to why the #ASX would even let them list here, no real market here, doubtful market elsewhere, #dodgyoperators written all over it. I really have no sympathy for any punter silly enough to put their money on this. Better off punting on pot stocks. $FIJ

273 2018-12-10 21:31:25 That’s not how it works. She has formed a minority gov. As much as I fantasise about seeing her in stocks in Parliament Sq, she is legitimately the PM
274 2018-12-10 21:30:35 Money is moving out of traditional stocks, and being prepared to enter the crypto space in a major way. Do not be confused by this "bear" market. It is a trap to liquidate your crypto holdings and put it into the hands of the Moby Dicks.
275 2018-12-10 21:30:22 thanks man, yeah have to double down on my emotions and take small risk positions, should try to just focus on 2 stocks at a time.
276 2018-12-10 21:30:19 They force stock analyzers to disclose whether or not they hold positions in the stocks they publicly analyze why can't they do the same with the scientific community?
277 2018-12-10 21:30:14 I'm waiting for ECB to follow BOJ and Swiss buying ETF's and stocks.

279 2018-12-10 21:29:46 Funny how stocks rebounded but oil continued to sell off.

You get cheap oil the same way you got ZIRP using HFT w counterfeited money.

283 2018-12-10 21:25:46 talking abt stocks all day makes my brain hurt sometimes
284 2018-12-10 21:25:17 Going on TV and saying that some stocks will be higher and some will be lower  next year and saying that most likely the market will be up doesn't make for a compelling narrative. But it is the most honest.
285 2018-12-10 21:24:51 Bank stocks are taking some hammering
286 2018-12-10 21:22:55 World stocks ex US tumble: Europe -1.9%; US +.2%. Another volatile day as bargain hunters piled into US stocks to erase a 500 point Dow loss. Noise still major driving force for stocks. No reason yet market should not see modest gains in 2018 & 2019. But fear could win short-term
287 2018-12-10 21:22:37 Iwwnt to invest in stocks but for marijuana, I feel like it's going to blow up one of these days

291 2018-12-10 21:20:26 It could be a BAD day for #Nifty #Sensex today. Get your wallets out and look for stocks selling at ‘distressed’ prices.
292 2018-12-10 21:19:42 All this macro stuff is great for conversation, but if you want to get super rich trading stocks, follow the best names, buy them from low risk entry points and learn how to manage the risk/reward relationship.

338 2018-12-10 20:59:40 Makings of a counter trend rally in SPY:  263 now support and 265 short term resistance with 268 a more formidable resistance.  Need to base out a little for a longer lasting rally.  FANG stocks look like they are trying to make a bottom.  A break below 263 will test 259 low.
339 2018-12-10 20:58:55 Hi Nate,how on earth do u just trade with the one minute chart and not look at resistance and support from few days ago or on the daily chart? Do u just remember it ALL for the stocks u are watching? Thank you very much .:)
340 2018-12-10 20:57:54 Tomorrow will be an interesting day. Will we see follow troughs and breakout in leading names? Software stocks are very close to breakout. I am prepared and watch them closely.

344 2018-12-10 20:57:11 This has nothing to do with POTUS, the largest generation in history is retiring & pulling their money from volatile stocks & moving it to more secure long term protections from inflation
345 2018-12-10 20:56:46 They did for the later, its that mode where you actually play smash but with a set of stocks of different characters.
346 2018-12-10 20:56:37 Stocks are owned overwhelmingly by the wealthy. You can't make the case that 1 year (maybe 2 years) of big wage gains (and even then have to break this down by decile to get the full picture) is going to even come close to countering the effects of a +120% in stocks.

360 2018-12-10 20:50:14 When you don't buy stocks that are on sale like $AAPL, you'll look at this next year saying to yourself "Damn, I can't believe I didn't buy it down there." Happens all the time. Trying to time markets is very difficult. You have to take some risk. Those risk usually pay off.
361 2018-12-10 20:49:53 Imho the #Fed cannot pause, would do more harm than good. But in order to raise rates and cushion the potential blow to the markets, it needs stocks to rally and rate hike expectations for Dec and ahead also. This way market just getting what it expected. So S&P rally into FOMC?
362 2018-12-10 20:49:09 hey who the fuck is choosing fd stages, ffa, 5 minutes, 2 stocks, no items as their preferred rules what the fuck
363 2018-12-10 20:48:29 As soon as you start convincing yourself intangible assets (stocks, this case) hold real value, you've already created unnecessary bias that will distract you from making the hard decisions like taking losses or profits where the market says you should.
364 2018-12-10 20:48:27 The Deep State can intentionally dump stocks and cause the Market to crash. Especially, anything the Rothschilds have dibs on. Just to prove tothe American public they need to be LOCKED UP.
365 2018-12-10 20:48:09 Because the only stream of revenue into stocks is people buying stocks. There are never dividends or buybacks, nope.

371 2018-12-10 20:45:54 I did not realise we had the best or the worst week since 2011. I does not mean anything. 

Stocks will move one way or the other based on sentiment, and once every quarter they will get some earnings results and people will try to “see-through” them and make “educated” guesses!
372 2018-12-10 20:43:23 Everything is fixed!

No more Tariff war, no more slowing Worldwide economy, no more Fed hikes, no more inverted Yields, no more poor housing sales, no more crashing car sales, no more huge debt... no more bad at all!

Now go buy stocks! 
373 2018-12-10 20:43:11 : Uh, hey guys. As you may have noticed, my stocks are going dow-

385 2018-12-10 20:37:03 I’m sure there were a ton of stocks that traded below the October/November low & reclaimed them for a RDR.  You don’t need to be in them all to make money. Does anyone want to post the one they caught to teach others
386 2018-12-10 20:37:02 I’m genuinely in favour of bringing back stocks & public lobbing cabbages etc at all of them. I’d feel better.
387 2018-12-10 20:37:00 @juliefisher just a guess that Asian Stocks go up tomorrow.

392 2018-12-10 20:35:25 Will be interesting to see how the defense stocks fare this week; you had to be buying into the fear to come in this Monday on top; it didn't help that folks were all geared up going into the weekend.

BA weakest of the bunch with China overhang.
393 2018-12-10 20:35:11 Tailgating (the traffic kind) and littering could be cured tomorrow by placing stocks in the middle of every roundabout in America and filling them with perpetrators.
394 2018-12-10 20:34:39 The year is 2019, and I'm the only financial advisor who still trades individual stocks and who doesn't have a podcast
395 2018-12-10 20:34:35 What if only the garbage stocks "capitulated" and the indices didn't?
396 2018-12-10 20:34:20 market moved  up as expected ,,, nice  up moves in fang stocks
397 2018-12-10 20:33:49 Again, I get what you’re saying but the Market responds to negativity, speculative or not, but it never responds to psychological uplifting news. I believe in these stocks long term...but they will bottom before.
398 2018-12-10 20:33:17 after being out of stocks for almost 11 years, this morning I bought back in!
399 2018-12-10 20:32:56 Because we're complaining but not doing anything else!  We need to collectively drop twitter on the same day or within a few days.  Same with Facebook .  If conservatives dropped them ... their stocks would crash and our voice truly heard.

401 2018-12-10 20:30:11 US stocks have had a mixed session with Dow and S&P slightly down on the day whilst Apple shares rallied taking the Nasdaq +0.5% as Oil settled back at $51.00. Currencies have seen USD strength with GBP the biggest faller as Brexit news continues to dominate price action.
402 2018-12-10 20:30:00 Hedge-fund boss Paul Tudor Jones says stocks could fall 15% before rebound. Tudor is widely credited with having predicted the stock-market crash of Oct. 19, 1987 - Market Watch

408 2018-12-10 20:28:45 Stocks recovered a bit, I feel better, it's still negative, we'll see how they play out this week as Congress ponders what to do with Trump for the next 3 days in session.

410 2018-12-10 20:27:56 at the end of the day hunting and fishing are fundamentally incompatible with capitalism mostly bc it values money over sustainability, but also bc it acts like rich ppl have a right to the local fish stocks of individual communities just bc they have the money to pay for it
411 2018-12-10 20:27:54 I think that was the signal, euphoria in mid cap and small cap is the start of fall. Learnings that will help us avoid traps, I think except for few food stocks everything was inflated and operator had great play
412 2018-12-10 20:26:47 homie stocks are fucking stupid
413 2018-12-10 20:26:27 Most commodities stocks have been hammered in 2018... and the discussions on HC look to have equally turned into a bashing, shit throwing contest most places I look... the tide will turn! #Gold #Copper #Cobalt #Lithium
414 2018-12-10 20:25:11 Yes everything to a bitcon investor is a BIGGER ponzi scam than bitcon. 

According to them wall st is a scam, stocks are scams, usd$ is a scam, bankers are scams, brokers are scams, exchanges are scams. 

And of course bc of that, “they” are trying kill bitcon. Lmfao yeah sure

425 2018-12-10 20:23:17 I put growth into registered accounts and high dividend yields in non registered to Max tax advantage over long run.  Betting the capital gains will be grow faster than the steady dividend stocks overtime. Also I live off of passive pretty much 100%
426 2018-12-10 20:23:11 It would be so amazing if The Fed would cut rates 0.25% next meeting. Stocks would be at new ATH's before Christmas

429 2018-12-10 20:22:27 more than half of SPX stocks in a bull market?
430 2018-12-10 20:22:06 Another interesting corollary: traditional wisdom is diversification among asset classes. Normally, bonds are seen as a counter to stocks. In bad times, rates are lowered, which makes bonds attractive.

Lots of investors shifting to bonds. But rates can't be brought below zero.
431 2018-12-10 20:21:27 Mr. Market has been manic-depressive for years when it comes to this sector. Many stocks are down 90-95% from their highs.

435 2018-12-10 20:20:25 you got that right. Got lucky with couple of his picks, failed after that and left. Tried crypto , failed again. I heard that his last project is to short the otc stocks.

448 2018-12-10 20:15:48 Not even close, most pot stocks are still way down the last couple months, This is going to be a huge 50%-200% bounce.

452 2018-12-10 20:14:56 What? Stocks go up and stocks go down, but nothing Trump was doing was any real threat to them, until now with this escalating trade war.

456 2018-12-10 20:12:08 Think it is too early to throw in the towel for 2019 as Doug suggests, but a lot depend on if you are a long term gamer and what you own and how diversified you are. For now, keeping my stocks, saving my dividends to invest later and lower. It is not 2008

505 2018-12-10 19:50:41 US #stocks plunged in intraday trading on Monday, with the Dow slumping over 500 points, or about 2 percent, as steep losses in major bank shares weighed on the broad market.

But no factor in this world will stop the growth of India & Indian Co's 4 next 30 Yrs.

516 2018-12-10 19:47:10 Also this is an ignorant comparison of stocks & flows. What's the monetary value of the UK gov's capability to issue the pounds it uses to buy goods & services & pay its debts. That asset is worth more than all the financial assets of all the corporations in the graphic.

519 2018-12-10 19:45:54 I wonder who the buyer is and where the money comes from?

It can't be QE money. It has to be fron another source. Most likely the EFSM funds that are now being used to buy the falling knife stocks.

It will only buy them time.

You can't avoid the inevitable.

526 2018-12-10 19:41:32 Yes, u are wasting my time. Sectoral Financial Balances refer 2 changes across sectors within a defined time period. They r not stocks of anything incl. money. They are flows of money, & u constantly conflate the two. I think u know this & are not exchanging views in good faith.

552 2018-12-10 19:31:23 tip of the day: don’t buy stocks impulsively while you’re waiting for the subway, no matter how bored you are
553 2018-12-10 19:30:52 I have come to the conclusion that without President Trump the CNN and MSN would fall like the stocks of the 20s. They are not a news organization but a resistance to the democracy of a nation. Therefore they need to be labeled as a Treasonous regime.
554 2018-12-10 19:30:34 But you're missing a key driver... the Lehman-like crash to come. Hasn't happened yet. #Palladium setting higher highs but the duration between each getting shorter and shorter, suggesting the peak is close. Palladium will fall faster than stocks from the cliff edge to come IMHO.
555 2018-12-10 19:30:07 And yet those who would shriek over synthetic stocks or a pistol grip, probably saw it either on a mobile phone, laptop, or big screen TV that would be utterly unrecognizable to someone from 100 years ago.

557 2018-12-10 19:29:28 Past midday, Mortgage Bonds near unchanged, off best levels. Stocks cut most losses ... Dow -90 points. 10-yr yield 2.86%.
558 2018-12-10 19:29:02 you will be feeling the pain. 

Trump’s irresponsible actions, tariffs, stupid tweets, attacks on US businesses, and support of foreign business all have added to the lousy stock performance of 2018. 

Trump knows treason, he doesn’t know stocks. 

Trump’s bad for retirees.
559 2018-12-10 19:28:31 Stocks cut losses in half. Mortgage Bonds at session lows.

562 2018-12-10 19:26:55 Some of the emerging markets might be safe haven if you are in stocks and what not.  I think anything dollar denominated is going to be a scourge to the investor shortly.
563 2018-12-10 19:26:21 Example: You make 100k/year, tax rate 20%. You buy 50k worth of stocks, so you pay 0.2x(100-50)=10k in year one. Next year the stock appreciates to 100k and you sell it all, so your income for that year is 200k and you pay 40k.
564 2018-12-10 19:25:39 Look for bottoming of stocks in early 2nd Quarter of 2019...We have another 10 percent drop to go in S&P 500 before buyers will come in...If Trump passes Infrastructure Bill in 2019 then stocks will rock!!!

579 2018-12-10 19:16:43 Stocks look forward... Recent trends aresigns of assessments being made today of what is ahead. It is the future stimulus (stimulii to be correct),  not  the past ones,  that are now being dial-down.
580 2018-12-10 19:16:13 The fact that GSP is being integrated is fine, but many matches are based outside your preferences, connections are ass 90% of the time, and idek if you can choose a different character in soloplay. Some guy lost 2 stocks from dying ONCE.

593 2018-12-10 19:10:38 Yes. algos and queasy investors could take stock prices down more, our research on sustainable EPS est trends is indicating the downside potential for stocks is much less significant today than back in September.

612 2018-12-10 19:02:41 Morgan Stanley 1/4: The underperformance of U.S. growth stocks could result in  relatively less tightening from the Fed, which should drive dollar  weakness, especially given its expensive starting point.

631 2018-12-10 18:54:45 This market crash will probably be similar to 2008 (maybe worse), too many asset bubbles and zombie corporations.  Many companies tried to fool investors with these stock buybacks instead of reinvesting that money into their business/employees. #spy #stocks

638 2018-12-10 18:51:04 "In stocks, it’s the only place where when things go on sale, people get unhappy. If I like a business, then it makes sense to buy more at 20 than at 30. If McDonald's reduces the price of hamburgers, I think it’s great." - Warren Buffett

670 2018-12-10 18:34:03 You could say the same thing about stocks. Does it make stocks just stories without any underpinning in reality?

The supporting information for this comment is immense. Banks are not a neutral benevolent presence, a community granddaddy; they're a very aggressive self-interested profiteer. Hence, informed people "bank" w/ credit unions. #stocks #stockstowatch #finance

727 2018-12-10 18:04:28 Stocks being down has nothing to do with China trade fears or Brexit. It's not being undervalued either (though that is a fact). It's being used as cover right now as big spenders from Deep State remove their money.

734 2018-12-10 18:03:44 No doubt that’s why you must invest. Investing in stocks etc will make the money that much longer. It’s all about hustling and never stopping. Not 1 hustle but multiple hustles
735 2018-12-10 18:03:19 No, it does not look bullish for many reasons. However, I dont think it's a guaranteed rule that commodities will selloff (or with equal severity) with stocks this time, as they've been in a current downtrend.
736 2018-12-10 18:03:14 Anyone with half a brain and reading comprehension skills knows that big tech is driving the decline in stocks. Apparently you're not that bright.

753 2018-12-10 17:56:03 Not necessarily. Commodities crashed with stocks in 2008 because they were in a previous uptrend. If stocks were to crash right now, it’s not entirely guaranteed that commodores will dump (or at least not as severely).
754 2018-12-10 17:56:03 This correction is officially over only when experts say "sell and save your shirt" instead of "this is a really good opportunity to add some quality stocks", till that it's pure drama.

778 2018-12-10 17:46:36 It is a little early to give up on 2019.  Stocks already have a lot of bear sentiment priced in and maybe more to come in 2019.  Im just hoping we will see bottom in first quarter.
779 2018-12-10 17:46:20 There has been tremendous volatility in #stocks over the past few months. We will discuss what is causing this today on @WBBMNewsRadio AM780 FM105.9 at 12:30 CT. Please tune in if you have a few minutes. A lot to talk about!

786 2018-12-10 17:43:15 Wanted: honest financial headlines.  I've included a few suggestions:

• Stocks fall for no apparent reason
• Rates continue to wobble around, reasons unclear
• Bitcoin moves in directions
• People without any predictive power have predictions anyway
787 2018-12-10 17:43:00 Oh sorry my mistake. I saw an article with just five stocks in the portfolio so far. That must’ve been an article you retweeted or linked to. Great to hear you’re diversified!
788 2018-12-10 17:43:00 Depending on what stocks Trump owns, Is there any insider trading going on?
789 2018-12-10 17:40:55 As of about an hour ago, more than 50% of the S&P’s 500 stocks were down more than 20% from their 52w highs @bespokeinvest

791 2018-12-10 17:40:31 $AAPL could turn this entire market around today. If she retouches $168, it will turn green as will markets. It's always hard to predict bottoms and tops. You just have to find a level that seems like a great value. We received that today in $AAPL and a large # of stocks.

795 2018-12-10 17:39:01 I say we start investigating ALL THEIR CAMPAIGN Contributions & figure out HOW THEY ALL END UP MILLIONAIRES by end of service. Also let's look at Stocks they purchase, when they purchase & what insider info it correlates with #MAGA @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity @IngrahamAngle
796 2018-12-10 17:38:54 very possible scenario....after hitting -50% all central banks on the planet will buy stocks like BoJ already does.....long gold and usd cash are the only safe havens now, gold stocks may jump too because nobody has them and they are broadly underweighted!

C'est souvent pas hasard que l'on découvre les vraies raisons de la colère.
896 2018-12-10 17:05:41 The Pound sinks, and stocks and bonds are sinking too.  We must do something now!
897 2018-12-10 17:05:30 I think stocks are going to new highs in 1H 2019
898 2018-12-10 17:05:28 That's the issue people are still comparing bitcoin with traditional stocks and crashes with dot com bubble. You gotta consider it's features, demand/supply, population of world and all the physical money in the world to predict it's prices.
899 2018-12-10 17:04:43 Anybody else having the same problem as @SpecialKBrook? @amirkingkhan isn't answering his phone.............hope he's ok. On a serious note though, andrex stocks have risen 60%. 
900 2018-12-10 17:03:56 I have 6 stocks in my share portfolio. Only two are positive ytd. At least I'm not worse than the average.
901 2018-12-10 17:03:29 In the words of JPM "stocks tend to fluctuate" I think he latter added microcap biotechs tend to fluctuate more. It's a rough and volatile space, but the beta will give you opportunities.
902 2018-12-10 17:03:03 $TTPH $AKAO $SNAP stocks are simply financial instruments that at times drop and other rise, the globalized capital market will prevail duh
903 2018-12-10 17:02:57 They are probably not that intelligent, they are just knowledgeable in a subject that people associate with being intelligence (i.e. knowing a lot about politics, stocks, medicine)
904 2018-12-10 17:02:15 Why are we comparing stocks to crypto though? If i own btc and 20 of your index are bitcoin forks, i receive your entire index for free while anyone buying your index plows in fiat to buy the forks.
905 2018-12-10 17:02:12 Everyone wants to blame brexit for the DJIA today (down ~800 ytd) but it’s really bank stocks.
906 2018-12-10 17:01:46 $MLNX is in the green for now. $MSTF was there for a minute, but no longer -- I would look for both of these stocks to finish up? #investing #semiconductors #techstocks $Nasdaq
907 2018-12-10 17:01:21 $VOLD continues to roll over on each bounce attempt indicating more down flow than up. $ADD bouncing with individual stocks finding supports. Currently $NQ_F supporting at 6533.25, the (3) 76.4%. Below there I think we see bigger rolls across the board.

913 2018-12-10 17:00:17 I think this month will be best for hunting stocks that have bottomed and snatching those up at a discount. The markets may not boom like crazy again, but you won't lose much on what you put in -- as long as you invest in the right place! #investing #markets #StockMarketNews

It is the night of our dead cat bounce's birth

930 2018-12-10 16:54:58 I don’t know much about stocks but 
931 2018-12-10 16:54:57 Stocks are continuing it's down trend from Friday's selloff this morning on data from China and a sharp decline in it's exports.  MBS is up 8bps and Yields have slid down below an important floor and is at 2.83%.
932 2018-12-10 16:54:47 Wild action in pot stocks again. Take care in the whipsaws. Once you get caught, if you ever get caught the wrong way, you will feel it just as investors feel the pain on by and hold.
933 2018-12-10 16:53:52 Look for what stocks are holding up best realtive to SPY. They will likely outperform once the correction is over.
934 2018-12-10 16:53:44 You are dumpster diving in Canadian energy stocks.  Wood shed action.  Even after tax loss selling they are going lower.  Institutions are leaving this space for a long time.  Probably need a govt change to get them interested again.
935 2018-12-10 16:53:26 Smocks, stocks what’s the difference? Wonder if POTUS knows? 
936 2018-12-10 16:53:06 I wanna see Old Mick in stocks. Real stocks. In the town square. In winter.
937 2018-12-10 16:52:20 Dear God, imagine where it will be if he's in office for another two years?  When he was elected, I slowly got rid of most of my stocks.  Thank goodness because I listened to @HillaryClinton.
938 2018-12-10 16:52:17 I just looked and there are many very liquid stocks in the 13-F portfolio that are down way more than Berkshire in Q4.  I suspect that we may see more aggregate buying of common stocks in Q4 than repurchases.  Maybe a lot more.
939 2018-12-10 16:51:53 One of the best looking charts is the VIX, the CBOE Market Volatility Index.  It's at 24.70 now, and it looks to me like a major move up will begin soon, that may ultimately result in the index taking out the high of 89.53 hit in Oct. of 2008. That is very bearish for stocks!
940 2018-12-10 16:51:24 Like stocks and shares I see it as rossy. YouTube and watch a few videos explaining it.
941 2018-12-10 16:51:18 Except that it's the tech stocks, Apple leading the way along with Tesla and Facebook, that are causing the market to tank. That's fact.
942 2018-12-10 16:50:47 $SPY and of course stocks up is part of this pivot. $IJH $IWM 2/
943 2018-12-10 16:50:22 i'm totally talking my book here
and overall i expect stocks much lower

a nice equity bounce here would really fuck with everybody, i think longs and shorts probably oversold themselves recently

put the market a little above todays highs and buyers get sucked in and sellers out
944 2018-12-10 16:50:13 Sucks cause all my stocks are down and it would be a great time to buy. Problem is I already have allocated all the money I can afford to in the stocks...which are down...you see my problem now

946 2018-12-10 16:49:09 Many crypto people are so naive that they think crypto is not correlated with stocks. When the stock market crash comes, there will be PURE PANIC: everything will be sold!!!!!!!!!!

948 2018-12-10 16:48:45 I can't imagine that that will be a tradeoff issue during this Q at least - just not enough time to deploy all that cash, even when both buying stocks and repurchasing.

Doesn't matter that you have good earnings.

1024 2018-12-10 16:29:18 Hey @realDonaldTrump your stocks keep falling. 

-2,000 in 5 days.
1025 2018-12-10 16:27:28 This was changed a bit, but you have a lot of options to choose from. I’d stay away from individual stocks (personally not my thing) but something longterm like mutual funds, ETFs, Roth IRA, CDs or a college savings plan.

1125 2018-12-10 16:03:49 Crypto value fluctuations do not depend on any stocks, commodities or Fiat fluctuations. Cryptocurrency is in a self correction period that’s why it’s down. So clearly with my narrative crypto can increase in value even when stocks go down in value!!
1126 2018-12-10 16:03:42 Banish this thought. "It has to go up."  Why? Cuz you own it? A stock is not a living entity. It doesn't even know you  exist. #stocks

1160 2018-12-10 15:54:42 Let me educate you! Ford seems to be doing ok. So the tariff argument doesn't wash. And when the worthless stocks were sold off we the taxpayers took a 15 billion dollar hit. That wasn't recouped from GM. And when asked if they felt they should repay...it was a no. Look it up.

1266 2018-12-10 15:23:01 i guess i'm saying: these horn dogs wanna buy stocks on a dovish fed turn that they might buy them early delaying the dovish turn, a rally might be bad for stocks.... hammer them lower and get the fed to turn and they you wanna buy'em
1267 2018-12-10 15:22:20 Nice. Take a look into forex. I’ve been trading it for about 6 years now. Huge bonuses from stocks. Markets are open more. More options to trade from 10x the money moving in markets. May be nice to work in that when stock markets close.
1268 2018-12-10 15:21:44 Meanwhile: unemployment at all time low, stocks all time high, ISIS destroyed, illegals sent back.... and I'm suppose to listen to those failed celebrity mouthpieces. 

Try again.
1269 2018-12-10 15:21:20 Somewhat odd how they define the risk metrics. Stocks and futures are also risky as is real estate. To me cfd's and binary options are two different world's.  Im just one guy, whatever....
1270 2018-12-10 15:21:19 Stocks open lower after their worst week in half a year
1271 2018-12-10 15:21:09 It's mostly self-fulfilling. If everyone thinks that an inverted yield-curve causes recession, they may sell stocks and save their money, thereby causing the recession, itself. It's more psychological, as in anything in the stock market.
1272 2018-12-10 15:21:06 What is the optimal number of open positions (in different stocks), assuming avg position size, should one have at a time?
1273 2018-12-10 15:20:50 Added another form of investment for me, apart of stocks,Unit trust,TH.which is gold.

1274 2018-12-10 15:20:28 FWIW the trump #steel tariffs have now exceeded the Bush steel tariffs of 2002 in hammering the stocks of steel companies.  $ US Steel now down -55% from the peak of Feb.  US Steel lost -44% in 2002
1275 2018-12-10 15:20:28 I've been trading long enough to know prognostications like stocks will be up or down X% over the next Y months are crystal ball. Too many variables to take into account.
1276 2018-12-10 15:19:17 Ever notice if btc is correcting strongly with stocks ?
1277 2018-12-10 15:19:01 Nice what do you mainly trade? stocks?
1278 2018-12-10 15:18:58 Replenished stocks of food for midnight snacks since finals  love you, mom  you da best 
1279 2018-12-10 15:18:50 And predicting stocks is hard.
So yeah probably a dovish statement but if stocks rallied they wouldn't

We're still at a tentative stage, things might be falling apart but they might also be just fine, fat tails they says
1280 2018-12-10 15:18:40 Trump's running it...into the ground.  Deficit up, stocks down.

1286 2018-12-10 15:17:18 @nitinbhatia121 Sir, is there any way to find out % Dly Qt to
Traded Qty in one place for all Nifty50 stocks? (i guess you said you will make a video on that..but i might be wrong). Any excel formula to use on bhavcopy etc? need to find about '4000Cr' buying of FIIs today! Thanks
1287 2018-12-10 15:17:03 It's what I think vs what they will.  I thought they shoulda stopped at 2.00 but it's what they think not me.

Besides, if stocks rallied from here to there they wouldn't even mention any problems; so predicting a dovish fed at this point is also predicting stocks don't rally
1288 2018-12-10 15:16:46 Didn’t Buffet say the stock market a mechanism to transfer wealth from the impatient to the patient?  Stocks decline, impatient sell to the patient.  Patient buying low selling high.  Basic concept but important to understand!

1297 2018-12-10 15:14:05 Is there a stock trading utility that tells you what bad stocks are in the mutual funds and ETFs that you might own so you can get out of them? I would think the 'impact investing' community must have done that long ago, no?

1302 2018-12-10 15:12:41 I believe the American banks are going towards a dead end. And when they hit a dead end, the market qill be plunging downwards and the American economy is going to hit recession. My call is sell all bank stocks $BAC
1303 2018-12-10 15:12:36 It’s a difficult December for markets so far. Trade tensions, signs of slowing global growth and central-bank tightening have roiled stocks, bonds and commodities in what historically has been a strong month of the year. ..
1304 2018-12-10 15:10:38 From one Puerto Rican to another, AOC, you’re an embarrassment to us. Focus on representing Americans, not dividing us by what % of Taino blood we have.

1317 2018-12-10 15:06:50 #stocks#FederalReserve#Trump Looks like both the FED and Trump are starting to run scared.  7 consecutive rate hikes, reinforced by the trade war with China, are concerning, given the economy's enormous debt load.  No one wants to be blamed for a crash or a steep recession.
1318 2018-12-10 15:06:07 $VIX muted, many Tech stocks in green
I would call for a triple bottom for now
Way too much bearishness for a move lower

1395 2018-12-10 14:45:34 After a record-breaking bull run in the stocks & #crypto market during early 2018, the rest of the year has proven to be a bit more difficult for investors.

1397 2018-12-10 14:45:23 Yeah, the matchmaking was way more consistent there, although I can't say I prefer it when I finally have a way to do Team Stocks in any stage.
1398 2018-12-10 14:45:16 Now the fools are trying to argue

1409 2018-12-10 14:42:27 I’m curious to see what stocks do this week...very rare the market has a bad December but it looks headed in that direction. i think we could see a drop to 22,000 or below.
1410 2018-12-10 14:42:09 my take: the shifts in stock prices are more or less based on the fundamentals — now that the house has flipped the price of stocks has moved to reflect the certainty that corporations and owners of capital aren't going to get any further tax cuts in the short term

1629 2018-12-10 13:13:26 True buying opportunity will emerge at 9500-9000 Nifty levels. Consumption stocks have to correct for a cheap/rational Index PE.
1630 2018-12-10 13:12:56 I can't believe the severity of the falls in large cap stocks with high yields such as #AV. #ITV, #GFRD, #SSE, #BAB - is now the time to be brave & buy some (more) or wait and see how #Brexit / #TradeWars / interest rate rises play out with the possibility of a bear market..

1638 2018-12-10 13:11:14 How so? What terrible decisions have been made? My taxes are lower, I got a huge raise and bonus due to tax cuts, my 401K is up, my stocks are up, ISIS destroyed (flourished under Obama). I fail to see anything bad. Also - he's put more sanctions on Russia than Obama. Traitor? 
1639 2018-12-10 13:09:38 Stocks is now a scam as a computer run system . Not even human making decisions now So cash better and wait intill fall of 2020 when the houseing drops like in 09 again . It starting to crash in CA , NY , FL already .
1640 2018-12-10 13:09:14 He could have gone on ignoring it. Plenty would have been content to pull the very last fish out of the water for another dollar. Not unlike some other stocks even now. Moratorium is unique in NL fishery history, definitely the most important conservation measure ever taken

1642 2018-12-10 13:08:59 Nah it isnt. It can cause a recession.Household debt is huge. Some will lose houses, others will just tighten their belts to get through, then retail plummets, unemployment goes up, tradies dont get work, bank stocks plummet so retirees get less, foreign investment dries up. etc
1643 2018-12-10 13:08:09 Not worried. Average bear market duration is much shorter than average length of bull markets (at least how it works in stocks), we should be in fine shape by this time next year. I think we're still witnessing the birth of a whole new asset class n it won't come w/o lotta

1650 2018-12-10 13:03:12 From my business perspective, they bid low to win and then try to manage costs to make a profit. Government complicit in always wanting “value for money” which equates to cheap.

1652 2018-12-10 13:02:09 None of which invalidates @Fox_Claire ‘s point. If you wanted to make money shorting stocks, there are less risky ways of going about it.
1653 2018-12-10 13:01:59 We have been advocating the return of the stocks for many years now, there is a law on the statue books from 1406 whereby any town will be downgraded to a village if it does not have a set of public stocks. Stocks were used to curb antisocial behaviours of the day! #Manicfesto
1654 2018-12-10 13:01:52 I mean in terms of size, they have very few artists they represent, in terms of revenue, they were on the 9th position in the charts, but their stocks hasn't been that good since early 2016
1655 2018-12-10 13:00:57 The re-focus on stocks instead of sensationalistic headlines will be much appreciated.
1656 2018-12-10 13:00:00 Holding bitcoin today is similar like holding Amazon stocks in 2001. after the dot com crash. There’s still a huge upside potential, don’t get fooled by noise. #bitcoin #investing
1657 2018-12-10 12:58:57 Too many NL politicians and fisheries ministets have been afraid to act to conserve stocks because of the inevitable uproar

Considering a crazy day tomorrow, its gonna be panic and chaos, i believe its the best time to BUY good investment stocks. Can you plz provide your favorites, so that small investor can park their funds for short and long term?
1661 2018-12-10 12:55:33 That's what I keep saying. To many stupid kids on the OTC. They don't know how to spell, count or trade stocks.

1664 2018-12-10 12:53:59 ETF- exchange traded funds, or buy listednproperty stocks. You have a piece of property and leave the headache of management to the professionals.
1665 2018-12-10 12:53:39 GOP Rep just said on @Morning_Joe that stocks and 401ks "are all going the right way" but he was unchallenged. No! Trump personally wiped out all gains this year with his dangerous moves. Why isn't this a bigger story especially for his business fans?
1666 2018-12-10 12:52:56 N Korea is building missles, Yemen in starving, the trade deficit is higher than it ever was, stocks are falling, your lawyer was indicted, you are individual one, your tax cut only helped the rich, I don’t think you are looking at this right
1667 2018-12-10 12:51:27 Many don't understand why stocks are selling off:

1. Major funds/corporations deleveraging for assumed recession in 2019.

2. China (and potentially Russia) selling equities to combat trade war escalation.

Knowing this, why would they sell $SPX 2500 when they can get 2800?
1668 2018-12-10 12:51:18 Depends if you can buy good stocks - we discussed this a couple of weeks ago.  But do you not filter the ones you make?  Or perhaps just a sieve, not muslin?

1675 2018-12-10 12:45:46 As on today base metal /EV/Oil stocks  charts looking extremely weak across the world , can change however as CRB Index is showing a sort of bottom. Rightly stayed away by and large from base metal /EV/Oil /U stocks almost fully, very few positions taken till now.
1676 2018-12-10 12:45:25 $spx back in feb this year when we had the steep sell off & strong bounce back we were looking at april months which pointed to several times that the bottom could fall out of stocks.

1679 2018-12-10 12:44:41 $CRON $CGC I see - So if we go with the targets set by analysts - all stocks are off by 25-40 percent and are on sale. In  bear market targets means nothing - Good luck
1680 2018-12-10 12:44:36 @SquawkCNBC Of course traders and investors Are hesitant to buy the dips. You keep reporting from your guests and contributors that the market is going to feel more pain and stocks are going to drop lower.
1681 2018-12-10 12:43:34 Last fall almost all weak hands will be wiped out.. Pe multiples will get further shrinked, stocks quoting at 4-5% yield, pe of 5-6, volumes very low. That's where bottom will be made.. #nse

1685 2018-12-10 12:41:48 No don't do that. Bottom is coming soon.. But last leg of downside can be ferocious, just like last leg of upside was insane. Remember how stocks like omaxe went to 80 to 200 in 15 days?

1688 2018-12-10 12:40:52 The social & economic impacts of mismanaging stocks are clear. MSY is an economic target not a conservation concept. Let's implement the law and manage stocks sustainably.

1690 2018-12-10 12:38:41 Trump's cult followers don't own stocks so they don't care about them; probably don't know how stocks work. And most are not getting/understanding Meuller info cuz they only get news from FOX, Breitbart, etc. Too dumb to understand all the laws involved in the Meuller probe.
1691 2018-12-10 12:38:16 You've been saying same thing since early Nov...... stocks have declined viciously and aggressively in all leaders.....FB $217 to $127.....NVDA $293 to $133......AAPL $233 to $167.....NFLX  $423 to $250.....more?! it's maybe a new bear market in 2019 where equities fall 20-40%
1692 2018-12-10 12:37:14 Bonjour @TopAchat, je me permets de vous relancer vis-à-vis du problème que je rencontre avec ma commande, avez vous des nouvelles concernant vos stocks ?
1693 2018-12-10 12:37:03 that one's good too, I also like "I got bongs not stocks bitch that's how you save, and when I cross the street I look both fucking ways"
1694 2018-12-10 12:36:56 As you go towards retirement, your pension & investments are usually pushed from volatile stocks into more stable currency/fixed bonds.
Majority of Brexiteers are therefore not fussed that markets are collapsing today, whilst those building and working for the country should be.
1695 2018-12-10 12:36:45 Please do not use Altantic Salmon, farmed or wild, for this recipe.  Both cause significant damage to our already catastrophically low stocks - as The Field should know.
1696 2018-12-10 12:36:34 Nah but he can kill you at 0 without trading stocks
1697 2018-12-10 12:35:46 It’ll be like this until January. Lot of money has been pulled out and its not being put back in buying stocks now is pointless
1698 2018-12-10 12:34:43 I fancy the real winners will be people who short-sell currencies. UK stocks may blip when the pound slips, but long-term they've taken a pounding. My pension statement will be grim reading this year.
1699 2018-12-10 12:34:01 How do you select stocks for this strategy?
1700 2018-12-10 12:32:43 Good good. Stock prices will hit bottom low. Time to buy stocks. Yay 
1701 2018-12-10 12:31:24 Yep. Mine survived the .com bubble, the recession, and traded back when stocks were printed in actual fractions, not decimals. The Michael Jordan of the OTC if you ask me.

1705 2018-12-10 12:28:50 Indian stocks still holding on to gains for the year,but they're disappearing fast. The BSE Sensex Index fell 2% today,marks its worst close in 4 weeks.
1706 2018-12-10 12:28:38 I use this indicator for stocks and options.
1707 2018-12-10 12:28:16 Yikes sounds like the system is really set up for crime then. Why also would others ‘lend’ the stocks?
1708 2018-12-10 12:27:57 Let me get this straight,Kass is calling for a bear market(which he's done every year for 9 years), but he's super long stocks including buying bank stocks for 3 months all the way down. So if the market goes down, kass will claim he was right, if it goes up he will do the same
1709 2018-12-10 12:27:31 Well, we have become laughing stocks.

1713 2018-12-10 12:25:37 A bull market fairy tale:
Stocks rose for 10 years on artificial stimulus.
Then there was no more stimulus and stocks fell.
The end.
1714 2018-12-10 12:25:28 totally.  data dependency works both ways....

Although I do side w Peak Stimulus | QE | Assets | Earnings + cycle probably more done than accepted, lagged impacts of these make 2019 a challenge.  Stocks won't bounce a lot, nor will rates,  Not 2016, but policy may look like it

Probably foreign investers too.

@SRuhle. How many foreign governments buy U.S. STOCKS??

I don't trust this sell off! NOT ONE BIT!

1724 2018-12-10 12:20:17 But Spanky, stocks have spent four weeks in the red, because of your tariffs. The pessimism has been exacerbated by data showing the world’s largest economies – the United States, China, Japan and Germany – are all headed for slower growth. Fix it fool. Drop tariffs.
1725 2018-12-10 12:20:02 SHOULD  I SELL ALL MY STOCKS???
1726 2018-12-10 12:19:08 The course of the #Bitcoin #BTC #cryptocurrency bubble is exactly like technology stocks #dotcom bubble in 2000! 19 years later, we know that an investment would have been worthwhile at that time, even at highest point.  Invest into Top-10 coins now and then Lambo in 10 years!
1727 2018-12-10 12:18:55 But will never have stocks here cause sold out 
1728 2018-12-10 12:18:54 I also think the nature of the market is changing, and now bubble-like stocks may experience such a large decline over the coming year. As many have already started their declines off the highs. $AMZN, $BABA, $NVDA, $NFLX are largecaps that fit that mold.
1729 2018-12-10 12:18:54 Urjit Resigns..Bad News :)
1730 2018-12-10 12:18:24 So many breaking news in a day:

1.Stocks markets
2. India won against Australia
3. Urjit Patel resignation as RBI governor

Media can claim these as BREAKING NEWS OF BREAKING NEWS.
1731 2018-12-10 12:17:27 Hmm good question. In those prior examples, they were broken stocks that were down and looked “cheap” or “value”, and kept going down a lot more. Now I’d think $FB is prime example of such a stock.
1732 2018-12-10 12:16:44 Oh no! Not the smocking gun theory! Are the even legal? Can bump stocks be added? Can they be automized?
1733 2018-12-10 12:15:03 Stocks across the globe are heading lower Monday including U.S. equity futures at the start to the new week-on fresh worries about U.S.-China trade tensions.

1808 2018-12-10 11:09:29 Fair points. But how do you explain the fact that households in deciles 1-3 have negative savings and at the same time hold stocks, funds and bonds of between 4% and 9% of wealth? We need better sliced data to see whether these groups really are unable to save at a minimum rate.

1839 2018-12-10 10:38:46 Hype will always play a part in stocks going up.

It’s a bit of a down ramp saying it’s fallen on results when it’s been falling an expected rates with the overall sector.

It fell severely due to major holders selling.

It’s only a loss if you sell.

1929 2018-12-10 08:53:40 The reason UK fisherfolk don't have quotas is that HMG, unlike other EU states, commoditized them, allowing them to be sold to anyone. Quotas themselves arise from UN agreements we've signed re: neighbourly cooperation to conserve stocks, so we still have to agree them with EU.

1932 2018-12-10 08:51:09 The obvious solution, of course, being that there won't be ANY fish for anybody if we all continue like this. No trawlers in any waters until the stocks have recovered: much reduced quotas for everyone thereafter is the only *realistic* scenario. Everything else ist just politics

1980 2018-12-10 08:04:02 @business @markets #EuropeanOpen @mattmiller1973 : The falling US Treasury yield is bullish for US Stocks. It would mean that The Fed monetary policy normalization is not wirking & would need to step up the pace!!

1982 2018-12-10 08:01:50 No... I spend a lot of time searching for the truth.. which Mr. Trump doesn’t know the meaning of. Fact: we are headed for a recession. Our national deficit is 3 times what it was when Trump took office. Stocks are WAY down. 16 people in jail for collusion.

1985 2018-12-10 07:58:37 Biggest swindles in history are
1. Govts telling depositors, “Leave your money with banks. We’ll make sure it's safe.”
2. Govts telling retail investors, “Buy stocks in listed companies. We’ll make sure it's safe.”
3. Govts selling #corporation licenses in "the public interest."
1986 2018-12-10 07:58:37 I feel like there were way more obviously undervalued stocks then than there are now.

Also, they reworked Lucario's upB and it controls me now (no joke, SD 3 stocks/3 games).
2021 2018-12-10 07:20:22 Japan market is dead. GDP -2,5%, Nikkei another down. Europe slowing down, and today is key day for US markets. Deflationary slow down is on the way.

2029 2018-12-10 07:16:04 The way stock market reacted to exit polls gives an impression that BJP is losing all three key states. This is little premature to react like this. In the past we have seen exit polls quite off the mark. Use correction to buy good quality stocks.

2034 2018-12-10 07:12:41 Let’s be honest. Voting is bull for stocks. It’s a scam so to make shareholders think they own something when they don’t own .

A stock without dividends is a #Ponziasset . The truth really is just that simple.

2143 2018-12-10 05:49:03 Today in Asia!

* Negative start for Asian stocks- Huawei Arrest sparked fears - "worst timing" or "predictable move"?
*ASX200 dropped to its lowest level in 2 yrs
*FX: Few gaps to the downside on the opening
*Aussie Home Loans upbeat at 2.2%- AUDUSD climbed higher
2144 2018-12-10 05:48:56 In times like these we realize the real risk in Stocks/Mutual Funds.
While falling stocks may shake your confidence, always remember there is an underlying business in every stock you buy.
2145 2018-12-10 05:48:39 I was joking about starting a paid group. I am considering a weekly speculation report covering crypto and stocks in near future. As far as stats I got nothing to prove to anyone but myself until I start asking for $. I'm not familiar with how GVT works. What's the deal?
2146 2018-12-10 05:47:59 It is a chain reaction. Govt pushes buyers out of the market by buying at MSP, faces deluge of stocks. Sells via auctions to traders who then buy cheaper than they would from farmers, depressing market prices. MSPs are a big market distortion, damaging to agriculture.
2147 2018-12-10 05:47:11 I’m really conflicted because my heart says to start a business to help the environment but my brain says go after the money in stocks bc I’m also trying to be the 1%

2169 2018-12-10 05:22:27 The greatest trick the robber barons ever pulled was to convince the world they didn't exist...  by using the 401(k) to align the interests of Main Street to Wall Street.  Once every mom and pop owned stocks they would never agree to progressive taxation, antitrust laws, etc.
2170 2018-12-10 05:19:17 he doesn't have that kind of money. over half of his net worth is because he owns about a quarter of Tesla, and another quarter is from SpaceX. Most of his money is in stocks or company ownership

My only complaint is that of banning Bump stocks. Not because of their usefulness, but it provides a precedent for chipping away at our Bill of Rights, in particular #2A.

2175 2018-12-10 05:13:15 There is no doubt that a leak exists. Wheat millers in MP, rice millers and distilleries in many states benefit hugely from the system. However, impossible for the govt to stock infinitely. They have to sell old stocks to make way for new procurement. And take a loss too.
2176 2018-12-10 05:13:05 An inverted yield curve historically preceeds a recession, yet the lag is considerable, and stocks usually move higher over the next 1-2 years. Markets sometimes have a knack for over-reacting.
2177 2018-12-10 05:12:35 “Propositions such as ‘the stocks & lash are cruel punishments’ are true in just the same way as E=mc2.

2181 2018-12-10 05:07:57 Don’t care about them either, but this provides a precedent for follow on legislation - like Florida has:

2319 2018-12-10 03:23:03 Trade Setup 

Buying Nifty around 10530-550 if you are a quick momentum trader for 40-50 point pullback is a good idea. (no carry)

If you are a bear, then after pullback sell around 10610-620 is a good idea for week trade

$STAF see the uptrend on Fri. but less volume. Watch over $2 with volume.
$TENX $TNXP Offerings, other pump & dump stocks like $UXIN $PTX. Watch for a quick trade but not chasing.
$ASNS watch for bidders & volume to go above $4 & 4.50.
$AETI continuation.

Too early to tell if a boss #ShortTreasuries entry is coming or if rates can crater on a new round of panic selling in $SPX. We'll probably need a max oversold condition in stocks to know. #Center
2343 2018-12-10 03:02:17 #nifty will fall today as expected. May be time to pick up some stocks at close today for a gap up open tomorrow.

2349 2018-12-10 02:54:40 Good morning, 

Dow tumbles more than 500 points, wipes out gain for the year to cap wild week on Wall Street

Stocks dropped sharply on Friday, concluding what has been a wild week for Wall Street. A weaker-than-expected jobs report and China-U.S. trade tensions
2350 2018-12-10 02:54:36 One of the best paying monthly dividend stocks $CLM Cornerstone Strategic Value Fund cut its dividend payout by 3.17 cents for the first quarter of 2019. A year ago they increased the payout by .4 cents.

Not good for fixed income folks.

#stocks
2351 2018-12-10 02:53:09 I'll not buy overvalued stocks. A fund manager, manages my money, according to offer document, should follow the pre-announced philosophy. If not, I'll sell.

My argument is not the last word. Everyone has the right to differ.
2352 2018-12-10 02:51:05 He's right, it costs way too much electricity. There's better things to invest in anyways, like the stock market. I'm rolling all my xrp over tonight before the opening bell tomorrow. Stocks will always be there
2353 2018-12-10 02:50:42 Follow stocks watch out
2354 2018-12-10 02:49:41 And the roar of those who want to feed the world with less fishing of wild stocks.  The polls missed asking those who want farms.
2355 2018-12-10 02:48:23 Listening to my coworker try to explain my stocks and options is like listening to a person who takes words from 45 different sentences and tries to make it work. #high #StonerNation #StonerFam #stoners
2356 2018-12-10 02:48:23 Precious metals green, and stocks all red...
2357 2018-12-10 02:48:06 So if Americans make enough to have a home and eat stocks have to fall?  There must be a different way to look at this.
2358 2018-12-10 02:46:42 Maybe all. But I am not betting on any of these. Gambling in bio stocks has never paid off for me 
2359 2018-12-10 02:46:20 I bet you anything @davidhogg111 supports Trump's new ban on bumpfire stocks. And guess what? That's a straight-up ban that orders people to turn in their property. It's the exact same thing as civil asset forfeiture. They're literally taking people's property.
2360 2018-12-10 02:46:11 Aden why did you think 5 stocks was a good idea
2361 2018-12-10 02:44:06 And yet the Democrats that approved him to be 41’s AG said he was a perfect choice! This is why the democrats are the laughing stocks of the world!!!
2362 2018-12-10 02:44:03 And it’s etf. Electronic trading fund. Reverse etfs take short positions. Again you’re retarded if all you want to do is buy stocks. Makes no sense and shows your inexperience. Nbd.
2363 2018-12-10 02:42:21 Im a swing trader.  I have 30 guys that work for me. This is not 2008 anymore. Restricted list is huge so you cannot short companies anymore with low volume. Big cap stocks don’t move and you can check the short interest on stocks. If it’s over 8% then we like to buy and squeeze

2385 2018-12-10 02:22:03 Couldn't we have just had For Glory with 3 stocks and random between battlefield and FD? that was all I wanted
2386 2018-12-10 02:21:38 Here are the dominoes we need. We're asking that no one pays4 anything but gas&food. Y? The media & dems have been lying2 all of us. They're obstructing justice &fixing elections in their favor. Stop paying in2 the system. Pull ur stocks..all of them. We're going 2 FORCE CHANGE!
2387 2018-12-10 02:21:17 Today we treat #cryptocurrencies like #stocks, just to keep in our #wallets to ultimately sell them for #profit.

2391 2018-12-10 02:16:44 Picking individual mining stocks as a n00b, perhaps could be construed as gambling. I do have the metal, approx 20% of my net worth. One of the funds I use holds bullion too with the mining shares. I'm about split between metal and mining shares.

2395 2018-12-10 02:14:38 We're asking that no one pays for anything but gas and food. Why? The media& dems have been lying to all of us. They're obstructing justice and fixing elections in their favor. Stop paying into the system. Pull your stocks..all of them. We're going2 FORCE CHANGE!
2396 2018-12-10 02:14:15 What if markets going down for a variety of reasons, one of which is Trump getting kicked out of office, no ones taking about it but there is some wild things making stocks this scary, not humans doing this

2398 2018-12-10 02:14:05 What is the actual problem @prahladkumar33 ? Over-valuation or inflow? Do you buy overvalued stocks? If no, then why should your fund do the same?
2399 2018-12-10 02:12:37 If any of you are Republican..we're asking that no one pays for anything but gas and food. Why? The media& dems have been lying to all of us. They're obstructing justice, and fixing elections. Stop paying the system. Pull your stocks..all of them. We're going 2 FORCE CHANGE!
2400 2018-12-10 02:12:14 Although not every downturn in stocks signals a slowdown in the economy, slowdowns in the economy usually precede a downturn in stocks. As such, the bigger and longer the drop in stock prices, the weaker the fundamental outlook will become.
2401 2018-12-10 02:11:21 exactly. And now they don't even let us have any return on our savings... so we either play in the market (pick your poison: housing? stocks? funds? gold?) or we work till we die.

2408 2018-12-10 02:06:27 New to #DayTrading #Stocks? All your trades should end in one of four ways:  

1. A small win
2. A big win
3. A small loss
4. Break even

You should never experience a big loss. If you can get rid of big losses, you have a great chance of being profitable for years to come.

Also, just wait till trumpites file their tax returns. Farmers lost profit margin due to tariff games, etc.
2411 2018-12-10 02:05:38 Dont worry!

2420 2018-12-10 01:59:00 I wish I could live in the dream world Trump lives in but instead I live in the world Trump created stocks in the crapper and Trump encourages hatred
2421 2018-12-10 01:58:42 He filmed her and made her a public example,then posted to social media: Today's equivalent of stocks and veggie throwing. Read the comments about her/him on FB, here. Can't agree this is good parenting.
2422 2018-12-10 01:56:58 So what you are trying to say is that stocks never go up and down and the planet never cools and heats up over time,you really think i should spend time arguing something as simple and consistant as that with you.
2423 2018-12-10 01:56:20 Global systemically important bank stocks are getting monkey-hammered and are down 30% from 52-week highs. Goldman Sachs is down 33% from 52-week highs. We will want to watch the “too big to fail” banks very carefully during the weeks ahead.

2427 2018-12-10 01:51:14 When Markets are Selling off, When is the Right time to go Long?

When Stocks or Indexes are Down 1-2%—Shorter Time Frame Trades-work for a Bounce.

Down 3% or More—Only Longer Time Frames into Trend-CHANGE Levels Should be Bought.

2438 2018-12-10 01:42:43 The theta will decay less as you have much higher time until expirarion but equally the premiums will be higher so the trade-off is present. Best to buy when beaten down in one direction after premiums get cheaper :)
2439 2018-12-10 01:42:31 Oh, boy. Another pump and dump clown trying to squirm out of the mess he's responsible for getting his paying subs into. So typical. How's the Standpoint 'Research'?

2458 2018-12-10 01:26:49 Yeah I'm certainly having toooons of fun with her, but I'm having trouble killing so far. Killing is going to be more important than in Sm4sh b/c of 3 stocks tbh. In this game, I think consistent kill potential will be rewarded a lot more & I'm not finding that with Inkling

This has been a public service announcement.

2465 2018-12-10 01:20:38 The Pope is no stranger to controversial stances, but with his latest statements he may have helped ignite when he called for a ban on bump stocks. As a show of support to defenders of #2A, enter to win a few virtue signaling points by whining about 'white supremacists'.

2477 2018-12-10 01:13:11 The best short term investments to do in 2019 are probably the Uber and Lyft stocks. Pump in and dumb, catch the flight, and dump at earliest dip. One more tip: Buy both!

2485 2018-12-10 01:08:04 and Doug Kass is super long, extremely over his skis in bank stocks and he's trying to insinuate he's making money. More proof he really doesn't trade
2486 2018-12-10 01:07:38 Real “Land of the Free” of you. 

You would rather live under armed guard then stop the sale of AR-15s or bump stocks. Real patriotic

I feel fucking lost lol
2488 2018-12-10 01:05:45 Top 4 stocks to watch for the week: $FANG, $FCF, $THO, $WETF, all may climb w/in 14, 9, 7, 11 days up to 6.2%, 1.9%, 2.5%, 3.3% respectively 
2489 2018-12-10 01:03:07 Even if ward hits URL stages,  I highly doubt he  gonna sign an exclusive contract. He knows what his stocks worth.
2490 2018-12-10 01:02:05 That is not true at all. US stocks were up about 20% last year. And obviously you weren’t paying much attention because we had bigger market drops in 2011 and 2015
2491 2018-12-10 01:01:20 Comprehensive background checks. And then you need to reregister and get checked out again every couple of years.  Ban on bump stocks. Maybe track people who stockpile ammunition? Seems like a good way to have stopped the Vegas shooter.
2492 2018-12-10 01:00:41 Mine too. The past week was brutal. Worst start for stocks in December since 2008! Tomorrow already looking to continue the trend. Their trade team just keeps on making it worse with their comments too.
2493 2018-12-10 00:59:05 I own stock in Reynolds Metals Co. my previous employer that was bought out by Alcoa which in turn bought out by Altria. Now that Altria is purchasing Cronos am curious how my stocks will do.

2497 2018-12-10 00:55:58 Stocks have been down the last 2 years in a row.  I’ve recently lost over 60K.  My 401K & IRAs were much better behaved under the previous administration (after having lost near enough everything in my retirement fund during the 2008 market crash).
2498 2018-12-10 00:54:21 It's good to know people close to me have now pulled all their money out of bank stocks.
2499 2018-12-10 00:53:46 you should prob delete some effects, stocks, whatever because u might have too many and it overloads it, or try to clear ur cache
2500 2018-12-10 00:53:02 After spending quite a while hunting for Thunderbolt 3 cables I’ve come to realise:
a. There’s still very, very few out there.
b. Almost no one stocks them.
c. Lindy is a great online store.
2501 2018-12-10 00:51:51 Do you understand this is relative? International stocks are down over 10% this year and US stocks only 2%. That is the definition of winning
2502 2018-12-10 00:50:45 Picking stocks is a lot difficult and tough.  Focusing on $SPY and specific stocks like $TSLA $NFLX have been highly rewarding
2503 2018-12-10 00:50:44 I mean, it's all about the money, right? Buy Apple stock. Buy Microsoft stock. Buy into Amazon at the jump. With my memories intact I could avoid the games I played back then and put that money into stocks. By the time I'd cycled back to near my actual age I'd have millions.
2504 2018-12-10 00:49:47 ehh yeah I had it mixed up with the timezone.. 9AM is for stocks if I'm correct, muh killzone is between 1 and 3.

first stophunt out of the gates and reversal around those times is the thing I'm looking for as continuation.
2505 2018-12-10 00:49:32 #Futures. We're off to a weak start. I expect to see better strength in gold and Yen. $GLD I have been strengthening these positions over the last few weeks so we'll see how it plays out. #stocks #StocksToWatch
2506 2018-12-10 00:48:36 Terrible service at the Orleans @RealCdnSS. I ordered $300 of food, I barely got $200. Every week, they are always missing products. Unbelievable they manage their stocks so poorly or cannot have substitution. Definitely switching to @WalmartCanada next time.  #shame

2510 2018-12-10 00:44:55 Nearly all of the stock ownership in the U.S. is concentrated among the richest.

2513 2018-12-10 00:42:57 @realDonaldTrump well Mr president as a supporter that voted you into office in the 2016 election will not be voting for you in the upcoming 2020 elections if you continue to support the unconstitutional move on banning Bump Stocks. “Shall Not be Infringed”
2514 2018-12-10 00:40:32 I'm not sure this is public humiliation. He didn't lock her up in stocks and let people throw rotten veggies at her.

2519 2018-12-10 00:37:53 Stocks are great. Thank you. Climate is great. Thank you. Fox News works well for you. No thank you.
2520 2018-12-10 00:36:59 #Stocks,#Indexes The weak bottom signals of 12.07 remain the operative signals, but indicating-- at most-- a 1-day rally, their time of influence is limited.  The next rally awaits its bottom signal (process).
2521 2018-12-10 00:35:18 Woah. That makes 3 new stocks that I’m aware of. Now for new players!
2522 2018-12-10 00:34:58 Only Fake news; Mexico paying for a very very big beautiful wall, Americans will get the very very best healthcare in history, only hiring the very very best people, getting rid of the very very bad bump stocks, climate change is a very very big hoax by China.
You’re bad news
2523 2018-12-10 00:34:30 In other words, these investors have piled into green stocks and they’re now pumping their investments. These investors fund climate change research and make sure the results are “correct.” Too many don’t understand how the world works.

2548 2018-12-10 00:20:58 you can choose which rules you want, but you may get into matches that have the rules of what other people wanted. basically it's a big outcry because people who want to play only 2-3 stocks 1vs1 omega stages without items can't reliably get that every time.
2549 2018-12-10 00:20:52 Robinhood i know you have a 5y chart showing but is it possible to have a 10y chart showing for stocks that have it? 
2550 2018-12-10 00:20:21 Plus it would make the gun manufacturers more money so the republicans would support it, and it would mean less gun murders each day so democrats would support it.but who are we kidding, we can’t even pass a law about bump stocks.
2551 2018-12-10 00:18:38 and that’s not far fetched at all. I’ve experienced that a few times. Items were obs out of stocks so not delivered but the company didn’t tell me, charged me full price nonetheless, and then I have to complain.
2552 2018-12-10 00:17:35 As of 7:15pm Sunday night.....  U.S. Stocks futures drop 260 points as sell-off looks set to continue in new week.

Australia Stocks (which opens before Asia markets) drops quickly on lower than expected China Trade Data. The ASX 200 fell 0.9 percent in early trading.
