8 2018-05-02 23:54:45 I would pay down the debt. If not all, maybe 50% of it. Cut your interest payment in half. Then aim to pay down the remaining principle over 5-10 years. Need to find a balance of continuing to invest in growth/dividend stocks and paying down debt IMO. That’s my approach.

40 2018-05-02 23:45:42 I’d have to consider both higher risk assets, but it ultimately depends on individual stocks & cryptocurrencies (or tokens), one’s investing strategy, and the actions of regulators & central banks.  I watch the yield curve—its flattening or inversion could signal a downturn.
41 2018-05-02 23:44:09 Oh boy. GL
42 2018-05-02 23:42:50 How idiotic
Anyone of those idiots consider death threats just might swell the NRA membership and increase gun sales???
Anyone following Obama knows what his anti gun rhetoric caused with gun sales and stocks.
A little bit of insider going on there????
43 2018-05-02 23:41:47 @bakun nope I didn't sell my sq stocks. But I'm confident to hold it. Tomorrow will add more for sure.
44 2018-05-02 23:41:27 I think the opportunity in energy/commodities stocks is the best I’ve seen in years. Cheap, disliked and under owned with improving returns

46 2018-05-02 23:39:25 Uh stocks are tanking again. Companies are laying off. Your tax cuts were not good.
47 2018-05-02 23:38:39 Maybe a public flogging and a turn in the stocks.
48 2018-05-02 23:38:19 What the hell...99% of americans believe in the 2nd admendment. That doesn't mean we should be selling assault weapons n bump stocks. Have you no logic to understand this concept? It's all or none eh? YOU ARE AN IDIOT IF U BELIEVE THIS.
49 2018-05-02 23:37:33 The problem is also that no-one knows how long existing tungsten and arc stocks will last.

50 2018-05-02 23:36:46 So I recently got a small amount of stock (teeny, tiny really) and I've been checking on it everyday. The micro differences in amount is frustrating and almost anxiety inducing. I could never do this for a living. #stockmarket #stocks #comeonalready
51 2018-05-02 23:36:16 That's a fair point. I think FDA wants to approve, but my bet is that they ask for more studies. I guess it depends on the chair's ability to sway others, as he seemed most on board.

58 2018-05-02 23:25:45 Bump stocks have been used in ONE crime (only one!!!) yet Democrats and establishment Republicans rush to ban them.  Meanwhile, both refuse to seal our Southern border where illegal weapons, drugs, and people flow across, leading to 1000s of crimes and human casualties.

Hmmm...
59 2018-05-02 23:25:32 So many former Blue Chip stocks have been clobbered in the last month. $IBM $MMM $GIC $GILD $PG $PM If not for the rise in oil stocks, the DOW would be in correction territory. Seems like there is some good opportunities in the value area.

95 2018-05-02 22:42:23 A lot of the commentary about #cervicalcheck now is ill-focussed rage. This is not acceptable from elected legislators.

96 2018-05-02 22:40:58 You have to treat it like an uneven stock split.  Dividends would usually be taxable (dependent on account type) because stocks are denominated in fiat, but it’s not a dividend.

99 2018-05-02 22:40:22 It is true that there are a few stocks with critical mass of trading interest where market makers are mostly unnecessary, but that is a VERY small percentage.  Beyond that, however, data is strongly suggestive of the liquidity benefits to market makers & liquidity incentives

101 2018-05-02 22:38:38 1) We already have defacto subpenny ticks with inverted venues, 2) Only stocks which should have .5 or .2 tick sizes are those with overly large queues,  (very few) 3) coincidentally, many of those are the stocks where rebates get mischaracterized as kickbacks
102 2018-05-02 22:36:10 Since the tax break Trump signed for them, most corporations right now are buying back their stocks, with Trump causing the stocks to drop so many times, they stand to make billions when( or if) the market recovers. If the tariffs go thru
103 2018-05-02 22:36:03 Yes. Knew this. We are like stocks or bonds to the Fed (the bank that was changed from Hamilton’s perfect bank into a federal “reserve” part of the 8 world banking families’ portfolio.)

108 2018-05-02 22:29:04 I agree but when so few shares are traded (especially penny stocks) big swings can happen. This company is still cheap so if you're holding be patient with it.
109 2018-05-02 22:28:57 You still benefit from company stocks doing well even if you don’t own them. A lot of companies give stocks to charitable causes, colleges, etc.

126 2018-05-02 22:09:27 $tsla in red after the earnings call. Investors have officially lost confidence in @elonmusk and have finally come to terms that hopes and Dreams painted in the earnings call are far from reality. My guess is @Fidelity starts dumping @Tesla stocks at this time. #CashBurn #Ch9

129 2018-05-02 22:02:45 People still trading stocks instead of crypto reminds me of limit holdem players in 2002. Everyone who switched to no limit started printing  $$$$ while limit players grinded out small edges, too scared to take advantage of bigger edges because of the volatility .

168 2018-05-02 21:36:15 I bought into Ali baba when they went public. Their IPO was around $93 a share. Last week it was close to $200 a share.... another thing to watch for is major companies splitting their stocks.
169 2018-05-02 21:34:34 Dow Jones Industrial Average down below 24,000. It started above 24,000 at the beginning of the year. Stocks doing worst since the great depression.

my question is: for stocks like $SNAP & $GLID when the general trend before the open seems to be a downtrend, do you only go for a short, or you go with whatever pattern you see?

179 2018-05-02 21:29:52 Mining costs are much higher that $1k. Small shops need $6k to wash. Publicly traded mining ops won't mine at a loss, just like Jr mining stocks in metals, they'll mothball. 
Too much investment to let a tightly controlled market tank. If $1k, I'll buy in and mine, so will others

189 2018-05-02 21:21:37 you got crumbs while the rich got most of the tax cuts, & you're too obtuse to see that's a ripoff. If the tax cuts were really for the middle-class, most of the money wouldn't have gone to the rich. instead of raising salaries, companies mostly just bought stocks back.
190 2018-05-02 21:21:37 Stocks have also come under pressure as investors debate whether profits might be peaking early in the year. Those worries have compounded anxiety about protectionist trade policies slowing global economic growth.  WSJ
191 2018-05-02 21:20:37 How about we peaked on earnings and now stocks are correcting.  It’s not that hard to see.  Commodities are going to rally.  Wage pressure.  All leads to lower margins.  Sad but true.

200 2018-05-02 21:09:03 I just last week watched Michael Hudson end to say that the only safe place for your money was T Bills. His definitive conclusion was that they would always pay as opposed to stocks & bonds. More squirrelly bonds than ever passive or aggressive, in my view
201 2018-05-02 21:08:15 Yeah they repressed it but man its like 20 bones. We have a vinyl shop here that stocks alot of the reissues. Some o broke down and bought. I bought blowout comb by digable.  Its double vinyl but the sound quality doesnt sound remastered. I have the cd tho.

227 2018-05-02 20:59:34 Okay, the fact that you ask people to google "what happened to the internet stocks" and then writing they ended like the dodo means you don't know that Google was an internet stock. Clearly they didn't all go away.

235 2018-05-02 20:55:18 Here's the thing.  Over the same time period I have been investing in bitcoin I have had one of my stocks go up by 12x in value.  Another one of my stocks went up by 3x.  No, those are not 100x returns like bitcoin delivered, but a long way from 9% and more diversified. NVDA/TSLA
236 2018-05-02 20:55:08 Add to such technical indicators: (1) growing consensus among EW analysts that wave counts point downward, (2) Fed’s QT now in full swing, (3) BTD is fading away as an investment strategy. End result: vicious cycle with ever decreasing demand for stocks & cash being funneled out

238 2018-05-02 20:54:07 IFXY Bombarding with increasing good news through July it has a good chance of doing real good. but a single good news and not keeping it up it will do fair. As with other sub penny stocks. Along with CSRH which could do good
239 2018-05-02 20:54:03 Sometimes when folks have pre-set orders to sell and the stock jumps before they have the chance to move it up. If a few larger blocks sell it triggers a panic. I've had a few stocks that it jumped so abruptly it hit my sell order.

245 2018-05-02 20:51:54 You may be right in the short term but any analysis of history suggests those stocks are doomed for longer term outperformance.
246 2018-05-02 20:51:38 Utter nonsense. You don't understand the argument, just really you don't. We could go into it but whats the point when you don't even understand stocks & flows. If you really want to I'm up for it.
247 2018-05-02 20:51:38 I agree! The weighting is the larger issue in my opinion, though. There remains about a third of current mining stocks in URA only. The uranium ETF - GONE!
248 2018-05-02 20:50:55 U.S. stocks dropped on Wednesday as investors remained concerned about worsening trade relations between the United States and China and digested the Federal Reserve's decision to leave interest rates unchanged.

251 2018-05-02 20:50:27 To be fair, my experience investing in stocks as a hedge fund manager greatly informed my @BloombergTV reporting. But I was out of all that when I returned to journalism. Readers need to know that the only reason you write an article is because the facts need to be known.

260 2018-05-02 20:44:57 Oui mais je veux dire, le côté stocks en tension, avec des surgelés c'est moins évident. D'autant qu'ils en ont fait rentrer plusieurs fois, ils ont disparu deux fois. Je pense que c'est une question de recette plus que d'attente. Genre un essai foiré.
261 2018-05-02 20:44:36 Need to do some analysis on that article, Seb.  Was offended by the suggestion it makes that investors should avoid Cameco and other component stocks during transition, encouraging investors to look at other uranium stocks instead. Seems to be a promo for a stock not held in URA.

281 2018-05-02 20:33:31 'A service performed for money' is almost the definition of a commodity. And commodities always embody social relations. Many commodities (e.g. stocks, patent rights, financial instruments, etc) are nothing but social relations.

285 2018-05-02 20:31:37 They will approve it for cUTI, surely. It's hard to say if they'll approve it for BSI. They could, but I agree that with THIS *particular* division, it is unlikely.

288 2018-05-02 20:29:21 I'm still not convinced people from inside DSG and Yeti aren't tanking their stocks on purpose. It wouldn't be surprising to see if there were massive stock dumps by executives before these little PR stunts.
289 2018-05-02 20:28:36 I say this because I'M taking the L. $AKAO is my biggest spec bio holding.

To see people's reaction be 'well actually, FDA is likely to approve it anyways' comes off as wishful thinking.

298 2018-05-02 20:23:18 Bloomberg guest making the case that volume goes up when stocks go down and that's bearish. Problem is the hallmark of the entire market since 09 has been higher volume on downside. So why is it different now?

1. How much risk per trade (in %) did you take?

2. How many stocks do you typically hold in your portfolio?

309 2018-05-02 20:16:54 The old bromide, “when they don’t want ‘em, they don’t want ‘em!”, is perfect for today’s market. Good earnings, no Fed action and they still threw stocks over the side. The screen all red and breadth not great: 1 to 1, and 1 to 1.5.
310 2018-05-02 20:16:14 #Insight - stocks close on the low of the day after FOMC minutes indicate that FED is expecting US economy entering STAGFLATION (low growth and high inflation) - this is a a negative narative for the market thus being caught wrong footed..!

312 2018-05-02 20:15:13 World stocks mixed: US -.7%; Europe +.6%.  US investors likely worried that the best has occurred and is not yet to come & is already priced into the market. Its clear last year's 22% will not be repeated this year; however, 5-7 percent still likely barring trade or political war

393 2018-05-02 19:40:37 I don’t like recommending individual stocks to ppl without research on their goals... I suggest a few high performing low cost mutual funds are your best best. Try to find some with No load and no sales charge. What service do you use? I use E*TRADE

421 2018-05-02 19:28:48 You need to look at the #tacscam again. The ones for the rich are permanent. The ones for the middle class expire & start to go up. It was a trick to the foolish to get votes. Most companies used the money to buy back stocks with less than a few % invested in workers.
422 2018-05-02 19:28:43 We don’t own anything nba teams nfl teams etc , we don’t invest in stocks if you talk to someone about saving money they ignore u. I’m not agreeing with everything Kanye saying but I feel him on them topics black ppl use as excuses the world fucked up ain’t nothing new..
423 2018-05-02 19:28:11 Yes that's what they'll do, they first ban the AR-15 even though many other rifles are like them just have different stocks because they'll say we banned those and now we've got to ban the other ones that fire similar to the AR-15. Gun control is slow and Insidious.

444 2018-05-02 19:15:32 Because I’m not as heavily invested into stocks as I am crypto. My stocks are ones I’ve had for 10+ years meant for cashing out when I need it like a savings fund. They’ve all been steadily increasing since I was young and for the most part I don’t mess with them
445 2018-05-02 19:15:31 To the point of @ChronicallyRara, it’s a step in the right direction. If we can attempt to prevent something worse from happening, that should be good. How is banning bump stocks a bad thing? What good use comes out of utilizing a bump stock? What is the need in every day life?

463 2018-05-02 19:06:06 What about being needlessly stopped out?  I.e. market volatility or a short-term event.  That to me is horrible.  I think we nearly always underestimate how volatile stocks are.  Not least due to many people having stop losses and so selling at say a 20% loss etc.

519 2018-05-02 18:38:10 Prof. Cramer, I wish we could get a chart like this one for all other stocks that took a dive since you either recommended them on @MadMoneyOnCNBC or interviewed the CEO. Here are some of them: $URI, $HON, $NUE, and $HON.

527 2018-05-02 18:33:37 Stop acting like Amazon couldn't absorb the costs. That's ludicrous and you know it. In fact, if they did it they would redeem their reputation with a ton of people. (Also, we are not even talking about the amount they make in stocks.)
528 2018-05-02 18:33:00 Holding stocks of a company which might be bought out, is the safest way to lock in profit in this market.. Perfect Example- Cannimed Shareholders !! no matter how bad the market was, they still got premium dollars for their stock !!
529 2018-05-02 18:32:52 tickers like $IMTE, $SEII, $BOXL and the other sub 1M float stocks running on no other reason than the fact that "guru's" pump, hype, text alert this garbage, for the sole fact that they're easily manipulatable. But hey keep sheepin on. GLTA
530 2018-05-02 18:32:42 This was one of the purposes of the tax scam and all that followed. Tank the stock market so that the greedy corps, and Apple is greedy, could buy back their stocks at reduced prices and keep control and get richer. Love my iPad but Apple is a very trumpian company.

548 2018-05-02 18:27:34 I don't buy single stocks but sounds like a great time to buy: "Furthermore, the company is well positioned to post solid profit growth over the next few years. As a result, Southwest Airlines stock looks like a bargain based on its Monday closing price of $52.83."
549 2018-05-02 18:27:19 Now it all mess bar perhaps TSY and USD. Won't touch stocks here.
550 2018-05-02 18:27:03 I share the fact that a community of 40,000 had very little interest. Go on to r/weedstocks and check for your self.  I’ve seen stocks such as HVT and Mari getting a million posts..showing interest.

3. leave midday if u must to avoid the grind
4. when shorting, stop out on high of day break

658 2018-05-02 17:42:09 I don’t see a need for bump stocks, but as @ElectAmyMurray stated, there will be a lawsuit filed immediately.  SCOTUS said that the right to bear arms is not unlimited and that guns and gun ownership would continue to be regulated.

663 2018-05-02 17:39:35 I love the fact that so many millennials are getting into #investing. Pursuing financial freedom. However often we're drawn to flashy, buzzy stocks/coins when often the boring, long-term investment strategy is best. #Study #Research #growth

671 2018-05-02 17:37:19 $LDSI #stocks what I have seen and learned ::  it is better, imho, to follow end of the day charts vs intra day Level 2 quotes to identify a trend. Level 2 is maybe a tool but that’s it, one  of many

679 2018-05-02 17:29:23 Marco Rubio, I was getting prepared to tweet USA about your courageous statements on the failures of the GOP tax cut and how corps are just buying back their stocks and very few investments into workers.

694 2018-05-02 17:19:11 I have the first one, but those Vestron releases are too rich for my blood. I could almost see it if they went the extra mile on bonus stuff like Arrow and Scream Factory do, but for just the movie and maybe a trailer or commentary, they're too expensive for me.

702 2018-05-02 17:13:55 Two brothers. One buys a house, which grows in value by dumb luck.
The other invests his money in stocks, which grows out of his insight. One pays capital gains tax. One gets to sit on his asset and use it as equity for other investments. Why?

@Xiaomi has a policy of not sharing their stocks at Mi Official Stores over phone. You need to personally visit and find out if they have what you want.

₹30 flushed down the (Mi) drain.
705 2018-05-02 17:13:27 Less pay and fewer hours to do hard work. Our ASD son struggles with hard labor jobs because he doesn’t have the skills. And he’s minimum wage with less than 35 hours most weeks. Disgusting and the executives pay themselves back in stocks.
706 2018-05-02 17:13:19 @david__belle hi from Switzerland, question here about a certain Sektor, insurence, is there any economic reason for a Europe insurence etf being 1% below February high when banking stocks and indexes still suck? I Googled a bit, is it just because of rate the hikes?

712 2018-05-02 17:11:08 That's true. The refiners are running more light crude, which has much higher gasoline and naphtha yields. We might be building up gasoline stocks leading to pressure on gasoline cracks.

714 2018-05-02 17:10:31 History shows stock market should have a bear correction every 3-5. We are on year 10. Stocks are close or in a bubble and fiat will be dead in 10-15 years. Crypto is the future and a much safer long term investment
715 2018-05-02 17:09:52 Perhaps you can spend a little time today on why Corporate America is buying back their own stocks and paying higher dividends to their shareholders. Plus paying larger salaries and bonuses to management. Did you say corporate tax cuts would be used for growing our economy? Funny

All in all Bernie owns $3 million plus in real estate. He also has countless savings accounts, mutual funds, stocks etc..
743 2018-05-02 16:53:39 Low Float stocks are consistently the best play if they have a half decent catalyst.. Low float for me is under 10M shares. Just make sure to check SEC filings if they need cash and if there is an offering mentioned. As always...sell into strength. 10-20% gains build accounts.

771 2018-05-02 16:43:07 You have wrong There. They are BUYING 9.9% stocks of a bank. With an option to buy up to 90% of the bank. That gives them controll over the bank. How is that marketing gimmick?
772 2018-05-02 16:40:08 Not necessarily true. Maybe exit but not short. Stocks can go sideways. Shorts are for broken stories and Apple is far from that. Far. But google is example of an “innovator” and they seem to be doing less and less these days. Amazon is the only one seemingly doing anything.

801 2018-05-02 16:25:34 Clean come up i just made on my stocks
802 2018-05-02 16:24:54 Just a doubt. I'm new to investing and I plan to hold the stocks for a long period. (More than 1 year) 
I'm using Zerodha for a few months now and have invested around 60k(MF and Stocks combined).
Should I be worried about the issues at Zerodha? Should I move to any other broker?
803 2018-05-02 16:24:48 @jimcramer is it too early to start buying some of the cpg stocks such as $GIS and $MDLZ?
804 2018-05-02 16:23:16 Ugh. 8/15, seriously? CARE gets uglier and uglier the more one looks at it.
805 2018-05-02 16:23:14 hmm, wageflation picking up.. as is velocity of money stocks......
806 2018-05-02 16:22:26 Don’t worry, it’s all part of my plan. @elizarde is going out of town for a week so I’m drawing down our food stocks so I can subsist on pizza and beer in her absence.
807 2018-05-02 16:22:13 I couldn’t agree more. ANY opinion on anything Jewish or Israeli is often classed as anti Semitic. If you were to criticise the Israeli gov. policy on fishery management of sea bass stocks, it would be construed as against their ancient rite to fish in the Mediterranean.

809 2018-05-02 16:21:39 Manu jee #Amaraja is very strong technically on daily chart. Writing CE for a strong stock is not a good choice one can write PE instead.
For writing CE you can choose  weak/ oversold stocks. By the way if you get chance pl close this position ASAP.
810 2018-05-02 16:21:32 Nice to see one of my US stocks (AAPL up 4%) giving a boost to one of my UK stocks (IQE up 5%). You could call it a 'special relationchip'......Sorry.
811 2018-05-02 16:21:23 Remember fella's - as I was told YEARS ago about stocks - "They all just pieces of paper...don't fall in love...they do NOT love you back"  SAME WITH CRYPTO!!!!!!

814 2018-05-02 16:19:08 sure guns r here to stay but the public doesn't need AR15s. They don't need more than 3 guns in a household. They don't need bumper stocks. They shld hv amnesty, people  turn in excess over 3,.... for $50.00/gun. no questions asked.  destroy those, they'd get rid  of millions.

816 2018-05-02 16:18:38 People may not care about those who have had these increases in home values but is this tax the right thing to do?  If you are taxing wealth, why not tax massive stock holdings of the very rich?  Going after people's homes while not taxing other wealth like stocks seems wrong.
817 2018-05-02 16:18:12 Tencent is the name of the chinese game company who bought out alot of stocks. Theyre pretty big. Nowadays they mainly focus on mobile games due to the popularity of them in Asian countries. They also published and developed the pubg mobile game.
818 2018-05-02 16:16:44 A stock buy back literally takes stock off the market, by buying them off their owners, reducing the total stocks available for trading. 

If their are 100 carrots, John owns 60 and the 40 are individually owned, john decides to buy 10 more carrots, he has 70 everyone else has 30

828 2018-05-02 16:10:54 The original game was actually never intended to be pvp at all. This was stated by the original dev team. The only reason why Fortnite got a BR gamemode was because of a Chinese company bought stocks and had a chairman in place.
829 2018-05-02 16:10:48 Ok Cool, he says it wasn’t a cult. But the cult is a big deal, and so him being suspected of being involved, hurt his rep and made stocks drop. That won’t change. We can only hope he really wasn’t involved with them.
830 2018-05-02 16:10:31 I’ve seen stocks sell off right before earnings and then jump back up after, and vice versa. You never know. I don’t try to guess at those things.

833 2018-05-02 16:09:24 Earnings this current season has been overall excellent, but markets aren’t listening. 

The problem most stocks were priced accordingly before their earnings released, Now, external factors are beginning to intrude on the fundamental bull case... Play the price action, not news!

835 2018-05-02 16:09:01 This doesn’t confirm anything, because why would he say “oh yeah I’m involved in a cult”. People always deny this stuff. So again, I ask, what was he doing in those pictures. Also, this story made JYP’s stocks drop, him denying it isn’t going to change anything.

843 2018-05-02 16:05:05 Kanye is right in the aspect of they are okay with us talking about slavery and police brutality because it means we’re not talking business and real estate and stocks.

845 2018-05-02 16:04:46 I’ve been trading stocks for 30+ years and rhe one lesson that is of the utmost importance is diversification.  Never put all your eggs in one basket.

849 2018-05-02 16:02:38 U.S. stocks were slightly lower on Wednesday, with declines in biotechnology and insurers negating Apple's rise after strong results, ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy announcement.
850 2018-05-02 16:02:38 Then buying back your own shares is to expensive and not profitable. Meaning stocks will stop rising and possibly crash, cause they are extremely overvalued. The ratio stock value-profit generated by the company has never been more stretched. What goes up must come down.

934 2018-05-02 15:32:10 I'm starting to see a trend develop over the last few days. People are buying stocks literally just because they're low flow and they're spiking HUGE on no news. Like $NVIV and $HTBX Really good short opportunity and/or dip buy right? @timothysykes @profitly
935 2018-05-02 15:31:57 Tex while i understand it’s concerning. Usually nov ish is a high time for the market.

940 2018-05-02 15:28:08 See lower yields to 2.60-2.83% 10Y over the next month or so, supporting stocks to higher highs, then yields soaring again, contributing to the coming crash which I believe will occur pre #Midterms but could slide into early 2019. Thanks for shout out edge!
941 2018-05-02 15:27:37 What you are calling an assault weapon is virtually never used in gun murders in the US and bump stocks are not necessary to bump fire a gun. Nothing worth banning.

1032 2018-05-02 14:59:22 Trading penny stocks for the past few months has done me little good when it comes to really knowing how stocks trade/range.

1033 2018-05-02 14:58:09 I am also proposing legislation to mandate state paid-for upgrades of all non-wood AR15 furniture to be wooden. I have learned that wooden stocks prevent high speed fully jacketed projectiles from incapacitating an enemy with 1 shot and obliterating organs.

1042 2018-05-02 14:52:37 Hi Dylan. Although not my favourite thing, keeping up with macro is essential. The reverberations of higher US interest rates is a good example. It affects all stocks to some extent.
1043 2018-05-02 14:51:41 I wouldn’t compare stocks or crypto as a whole period. Some stocks are safer and some cryptos are safer, there is no one is better then the other.

1070 2018-05-02 14:39:46 Big issue. If the divvy is paid in the coin then you get dilution for every divvy being made. Eventually the divvy is worth $0 because the inflation. This is why stocks don’t pay the divvy is shares. And the reason why the coin would payout in the coin itself /1
1071 2018-05-02 14:39:18 In my view Amit takes a position after lot of research and study. If the story doesn’t play out as he expected it is always better to move on to other high performing stocks . Concentrate bet big and accumulate wealth . Then settle for compounders .

1152 2018-05-02 14:07:03 Stocks are overbought and a ever growing wave of retirees will be pulling their money out of stocks until all the boomers are dead. Cryptocurrency is an infantile market compared to stocks, find yourself a good coin and hold for a couple years. It'll run circles around stocks.

1154 2018-05-02 14:06:45 People get ridiculously over sentimental about their crap*y AIM Stocks but the only way to consistently make money is by Trading them. Best to not mention Buy or Sell otherwise you invite aggravation and abuse.

1199 2018-05-02 13:51:13 Stock market is being artificially held up with Company stock buy backs and federal reserve to buy any large dips. Never mind the global debt levels soaring. Thirdly more money entering the global market means higher prices of stocks.
1200 2018-05-02 13:51:10 There’s a lot more stocks putting in new 52 wk lows today than there are putting in new 52 wk highs
1201 2018-05-02 13:50:55 True.

Unfortunately, some antis are taking the opportunity to drag JYP artists too. JYPE stocks went down as well.

An article was released, stating that the said sect/cult has spoken and said that JYP is not part of their group.

1211 2018-05-02 13:47:26 The currencies, stocks and bonds of nations from Turkey to South Africa have fallen in recent weeks, pressured by a sudden resurgence in the U.S. dollar, rising expectations for U.S. interest-rate increases and uncertainty over the path for global growth.
1212 2018-05-02 13:46:59 Are JYPs stocks ok now?
1213 2018-05-02 13:45:56 But that’s my point. Investors, at the time, don’t know that. Why risk a collapse in stocks for “Entertainment” purposes? They didn’t need to promote $20M because Floyd was a draw anyways.
1214 2018-05-02 13:45:50 Many have an opinion on individual stocks and market sectors, but nobody truly knows--which is why I'm a hardcore indexer.
1215 2018-05-02 13:45:26 .@whitehouse @realdonaldtrump: Your bump stock regulations will place you to the left of the gun-hating Obama on this issue. I stand with @GunOwners and urge you to not regulate bump stocks.

1219 2018-05-02 13:43:18 Momentum chaps are the precise reason why stocks and real estate become like a casino. They don’t care about the underlying asset. They follow charts and over extend asset prices on the way up and on the way down. Bad for the system.

1250 2018-05-02 13:30:39 Probably won't make stocks (corporations) irrelevant, but for the foreseeable future, stocks are more risk for less reward.

1283 2018-05-02 13:08:44 don't trade in such stocks. \it is dangerous and especially with zerodha who is always failing.. no use of keeping stop loss with them. Better to 2 do 2 things:

1 - quit trading
2 - choose upstox or fyers brokerage

1378 2018-05-02 12:17:05 Bitcoin is sound money and not greed. Millenials love Bitcoin because they understand "Austrian school of economics". Mutual funds and stocks are inflated bubbles and Bitcoin is the pin that will burst these bubbles.
1379 2018-05-02 12:16:50 This applies to every country in debt. It has gone much further than that in the West. The ECB, Fed and other central banks are printing money to buy stocks to prop up their stock markets as well as to prop up their economies. This can only lead to a big crash.

1414 2018-05-02 12:01:20 What amendment would that be? An amendment to make bump sticks illegal to a bill banning gun stocks sounds a little convoluted but not a little political.
1415 2018-05-02 11:59:38 Omg EVERYONE here is missing the point please check the korean news the reason why the stocks are dropping so quickly is because the cult he’s in is the cult behind and caused the sinking of that korean ferry a few years back with 300 innocent victims gone
1416 2018-05-02 11:59:32 If I was more diobolical i would invest in FB stock for the Oculus VR betting on humanity falling into a ready player one vr type future but I will just do pot stocks for now...

1430 2018-05-02 11:53:38 With #btc it is quite the opposite than with stocks. With the latter - sell when your cabdriver talks about it- because i.a. wealth of the company will be devided among too many ppl. With btc wealth grows with the expansion of it s network- so the more ppl know/talk the better:)

1439 2018-05-02 11:45:57 @amyreports Enjoyed your report on buybacks where you reminded people that 80% of stocks are owned by richest 10%. Suggest adding:wages continue to be stagnant after 30 yrs. More $ for 10% never has trickled down to reward the worker actually producing the service or goods.
1440 2018-05-02 11:45:17 So by that Standard what won't be "Hate Speech". I'd really love to see a massive exodus from folks on FB, watch their stocks dive, and then FB crash & burn. Zuckerberg made his billions so doubtful it would hurt him but it would help a lotta folks & Society as a whole!

1444 2018-05-02 11:42:41 Neither, just gotta look at their hands between stocks to find out. Although if they faked inputs inbetween stocks and didnt make any unique expressions during the match (crush face) then itd be gdlk

1454 2018-05-02 11:37:17 At what point do they start buying shares of the overall market just to own everything and make all stocks (that are worthy) go up? Almost seems like they could and would also benefit them.

1485 2018-05-02 11:10:06 Well written. I wd say skepticism bordering on cynicism, especially in one's early years, is the key to not losing money. If someone has entered this field in last 1-2 years & is finding it very easy to pick stocks, he's about to be taken to the cleaners.

1497 2018-05-02 10:59:08 Markets started to neglect good earnings so I wonder if it will also start to see postponed rate hikes as a bearish sign of a weak economy now and not the bullish sign of continued easing. It ould start to look beyond the FED just as it looked beyond fake EPS numbers. #stocks
1498 2018-05-02 10:58:36 Yes, but aren’t we supposed to value stocks discounting *future* profits, rather than juicing the stock price using the cash pile?

Seems like the consumer has eventually realised he can’t afford to, and importantly: doesn’t *need* to, pay anything like $1,149 for a top end phone

1504 2018-05-02 10:53:09 @porinju what are the possible reasons for stocks like PC Jewelers to correct close to 70% in a very short time? Some shares like Core Education were also part of Nifty and BSE Index but ended up being suspended from the bourses eventually.  Your opinion, please.

1508 2018-05-02 10:48:40 Those are two very different questions. You can get started with options at a lower price point for training, but maybe a higher capital level for implementation. You trade stocks or futures? That will make a diff on order flow discussion.
1509 2018-05-02 10:48:33 IT stocks gained plenty in last 2-3 weeks so now in consolidation and you entered on top. In my opinion you must set SL before enter any trade for now you can wait till 960 coz have enough time till expiry .

1522 2018-05-02 10:37:17 Some companies have already admitted that they would either invest in automation, which will replace workers, or buy back their own stock to increase executive & investor profits; the richest 10% of Americans now own 84% of all stocks.

1533 2018-05-02 10:33:28 We should invest only in stocks which are good in first place. Then it's matter of market realising it's potential, it can take week, months or years. Why invest and divest based on short term earnings.

1534 2018-05-02 10:32:43 Tips for buying stocks @religareonline
1535 2018-05-02 10:32:41 When I have dividends and capital gains on foreign stocks these are paid to me net of foreign currency exchange charges made by my broker. Should I report the net amounts for income tax and CGT, i.e. what I actually receive in GBP?
1536 2018-05-02 10:32:22 @BrewDogUSA it's been about 2years now that we have been trying to change our account with the stocks. All we need to do is switch names and bank accounts, yet we have been given the run around by your "professinals" handling it? Totally disappointed with your business practices
1537 2018-05-02 10:31:42 Thanks for sharing this. How many stocks we should keep in our concentrated portfolio.Please explain.
1538 2018-05-02 10:30:21 Tops is a ramper (now blocked me!) He knows it, I know it, the market knows it, to take a swipe at my investment in #PCGE was ironicly pathetic considering what stocks he peddles. I am very aware of the history of PCGE but it jus that history................ 1/2

1570 2018-05-02 10:04:15 Hi. If everyone follows the same and plays defense rather than offence, the overvalued stocks will become dearer and dearer with time as more and more people chase them. For a newcomer, how would it pay to buy at sky high levels?
1571 2018-05-02 10:03:21 The WSJ did an article in the 90s on this. A worker starting in 1950ish & retiring in 90s & putting same funds in stocks would return 2.25 MILLION. Yeah the government screwed us.

1589 2018-05-02 09:49:57 and how do you think, with current pretty dry conditions, prices should go firmer? even with high stocks?
1590 2018-05-02 09:49:52 At this point we have to be careful and not fall back into pre QE thinking. Price and volume action is very bearish and one would expect more downside w/o QE. However things changed and QE could still be strong enough to neglect the bearish action in individual stocks.

1898 2018-05-02 05:58:35 I am not sure WTF is going on with FACEBOOK, but for our business pages, some of the areas on the business page don't display well, our message box is not working and the call button is not showing up. 

I guess it is time to purchase Facebook stocks?

1901 2018-05-02 05:56:03 Well, I hope this wasn't a prophetic vision? Now that we are in May and the line had to be reset:robots? Not to mention someone with only 12 stocks requested your being REMOVED as CEO. Nerve! I still have a huge list of questions for you~I'd like you to preview and accept/reject

1909 2018-05-02 05:51:38 I hope this is just rumors about JYP and I hope JYP artists are safe... I don’t want anything bad to happen to them, the stocks have already drop drastically... please be safe
1910 2018-05-02 05:51:31 Once I figured out what bitcoin was I exited all stocks and put all into BTC.
1911 2018-05-02 05:51:23 Because it CAN affect the artists. Doesn’t matter about the stocks going back up. It can ruin the reputation of the company. They felt concern towards the artists bc if this was true then why would they need to feel bad for him??
1912 2018-05-02 05:50:38 Neves has just turned 21. He’ll be better in time.

1918 2018-05-02 05:49:04 The petroleum division officials said the fuel stock at the Hubco plant was less than three days of consumption while Bin Qasim plant of K-Electric had five-day stocks. The situation in Punjab was not well either.
1919 2018-05-02 05:48:35 Pretty much everything @myownpetard said, but I really can’t stress enough to source your seafood responsibly using resources like SeafoodWatch. 

Global fish stocks are basically at or over their sustainable limits, and a lot of fish gets mislabeled in markets.
1920 2018-05-02 05:48:31 True that. Not everyone bought at the current price, and not everyone would be able to sell at the current price either. It’s not a great metric. Same goes for stocks, tbh.
1921 2018-05-02 05:46:52 I’d rather buy 20 $50 dividend paying stocks than 10 $100 flights, and my wife would probably go for the purse  lol  who wins?

1926 2018-05-02 05:41:32 JYP really fucked up, the stocks already went down big time and even if this whole thing turns out to be fake he still has his whole lecture up on social media. Unfortunately all of his groups are probably gonna get a bad rep too in south korea

1942 2018-05-02 05:24:51 I am not one of them. Because I follow your advice. @Atulsingh_Asan you are a very good person who does all this research on stocks and shares it with less knowledgeable people like us.
1943 2018-05-02 05:24:18 出席とらないのになんで今日来たんだ...
1944 2018-05-02 05:23:43 I just read some short statement about the issue. Regarding their stocks.
1945 2018-05-02 05:23:34 Bad stocks are like bad relationships . It’s always better to cut the bag early and move on with your life. #LifeOfATrader
1946 2018-05-02 05:23:24 okay so lemme recap. . jyp's apparently in a cult that had to do with the sewol ferry accident which would mean it was actually intended + their funds and stocks are dropping and it could drastically affect their artists BUT it may all be fake because dispatch seems to be +
1947 2018-05-02 05:23:10 I saw the stocks go down earlier 
1948 2018-05-02 05:22:53 Crypto over stocks tbh. Only a small % though
1949 2018-05-02 05:21:56 
今日はいけないので僕じゃない誰かに任せます...
1950 2018-05-02 05:21:50 JYP posted a whole letter behind the issue. It's about his path and how he became religious. He also denied of it being a cult and what Dispatch outed him on.

This news is affecting the stocks and will cause him damages.
1951 2018-05-02 05:21:26 You rather waste your money on designer shit and materialistic things. I rather invest and buy stocks. We are not the same.....
1952 2018-05-02 05:20:29 I sense an insider trading happening right now... SEC will probably be checking stocks bought...
1953 2018-05-02 05:19:57 jype stocks have dropped by 11% since the news dropped lol
1954 2018-05-02 05:19:40 Anyways JYPs stocks going up again then this means it may be not true 
1955 2018-05-02 05:19:23 They say that JYP is associated with a cult that caused the sinking of a ferry (I forgot what it was) and so his stocks dropped
1956 2018-05-02 05:19:20 Great article, really enjoyed that and the way you've distilled 30 years worth of experience and wisdom in one post! Like your point on buying value stocks that show upward momentum. Thanks for sharing this.
1957 2018-05-02 05:19:17 Available in continental Europe & America. Limited stocks in Singapore
1958 2018-05-02 05:17:57 people who don't know anything about stocks should keep stocks out of their mouths
1959 2018-05-02 05:17:57 I'm really hoping the jyp cult thing is false, the stocks for the company are already dropping so fast. I hope that nothing will happen to the artists under the company 
1960 2018-05-02 05:16:58 The company's stocks are increasing again right now tho. 
1961 2018-05-02 05:16:26 Think about this, apple ( #AAPL)had a hundred billion dollars in cash in order to buy back stocks. That was money that could have been invested for jobs in the United States. Instead, they chose to enslave people in China.
1962 2018-05-02 05:16:09 Of course they’re going up, that’s how stocks work. doesn’t mean that the company won’t be affected. And of course he’s going to deny it? Do you think he’s going to confess lol idk if it’s true or not but dispatch wouldn’t come for such a important man without tons of evidence
1963 2018-05-02 05:16:04 Bc of that, artists under jypent might be affected. The stocks of the company was decreasing a while ago
1964 2018-05-02 05:15:27 some ppl think this whole jyp in a cult x samsung scandal is a fun thing like living in a kdrama. srsly wake up. it's more than that. jype is out there dropping their stocks bc of smth that's not supposed to be real and u think its fun

1968 2018-05-02 05:12:16 #Asian stocks drifted and the dollar retreated from a 4-month high as investors digested the latest earning reports and many markets reopened after holidays! #US equity futures edged lower after a report the possibility of a subpoena has been raised for president #Trump!

1970 2018-05-02 05:11:33 i) Buy on good quality companies
ii) Avoid paying expensive price
iii) Diversify in 20-25 stocks. 
iv) And hold it for long term because equities do great over long term.

Rest of the time do nothing.

2022 2018-05-02 04:49:02 Actually the stocks thing literally does matter. JYP aka not the actual ceo's record is now stained but as long as the stocks are fine that means there are still people who have requests for what they can offer thus more money for their workers aka idols/artists. So yes, it'sFine
2023 2018-05-02 04:48:15 U know how hard stray kids, twice, got7, suzy and 2pm members work to increase the stocks. Meanwhile dispatch just dropped cult scandal on jyp then the stocks incredibly drop. U are insane dispatch!!!!!

2025 2018-05-02 04:46:35 At least, if the falling stocks are any indication
2026 2018-05-02 04:46:02 He might be part of a cult and the leader of the cult owned the sewol ferry and knew that it was unsafe but let the kids on anyway and JYP stocks dropped 10% already bc of it and he might even be arrested
2027 2018-05-02 04:45:28 JYP is crying looking at his stocks right now.  What a mess
2028 2018-05-02 04:45:08 Perfect chance to buy stocks now 
2029 2018-05-02 04:45:05 LMAAAAO jype's stocks are increasing again im cackling, haters celebrated too early hahdhdhjajdjwjdhahjdakdjs
2030 2018-05-02 04:45:00 This is so sad. JYP’s stocks are dropping which is huge because it not only affects the company but also affects the artists and I really don’t want the artist to be hurt but there is just no way people are going to support the company after these rumors. Me included :(
2031 2018-05-02 04:44:54 Yeah but if it's true that group is involved in the ferry incident his company will fall. Stocks already fallen 
2032 2018-05-02 04:44:52 where do you even checked their stocks tho? haha i've always seen people posting those stocks updates but never knew where those came from lmao
2033 2018-05-02 04:44:48 Holy shit what got my fellow reveluvs steamin about Tempted. Did some article or stocks about about Joy?
2034 2018-05-02 04:44:36 The answer is that African Americans don't teach their children about credit and investment or stocks. Because their parents .. Parents was uneducated about it now we're moving in a cycle.. #BreaktheCycle

2041 2018-05-02 04:41:59 stocks are dropping lmaaaaoooo
2042 2018-05-02 04:41:29 It’s exactly what I wrote in an email to my co-workers... other stocks in the dating app game got hit today.
2043 2018-05-02 04:40:41 Increasing MSP will not only help uplift the Farming community but also stimulate the Indian Economy by boosting rural consumption and spending.
The Rural theme in India is expected to do well over the coming years, keep an eye on rural stocks such as Godrej Agrovet, ITC, M&M!
2044 2018-05-02 04:40:41 The stocks are rising a little bit, it fell 11% but has gone up 6% since. I hope this gets sorted out soon though <3
2045 2018-05-02 04:40:06 Yeah. I saw that, too. That's why I also emailed them to know how to actually place a bulk order. But yeah, I keep on getting the automated response. It's already May and it's making me more anxious since no one knows how many stocks they have.
2046 2018-05-02 04:39:57 Boulder council members have voted unanimously to ban most semi-automatic guns, bump stocks and high-capacity magazines.
2047 2018-05-02 04:39:41 I'm well aware about the whole jyp situation. I hope the artists wont be affected directly (although the stocks have dropped to hell). That being said, everything else better chill for at least 12 hours
2048 2018-05-02 04:38:11 just read the reuters article and basically a sub group of we from samsung messed around with numbers to make their profits look good?? but they got CAUGHT so their stocks and the parent/related companies' stocks also dropped, r.i.p
2049 2018-05-02 04:37:48 If new firearm regulations are approved, #BoulderCouncil is discussing immediate ban of assault weapon sales and phase in of other regulations, such as ban on possession of high-capacity magazines and bump stocks
2050 2018-05-02 04:37:41 jyp has great artists in the company but sadly all of them will be affected by this scandal being it true or not 

jype stocks are dropping really fast and it only gets worse I really do hope it will be solved in the best way bc the groups do not deserve this
2051 2018-05-02 04:37:07 wow jyp’s stocks literally plummeted
2052 2018-05-02 04:36:53 Okay jyp save the artist,  save the stocks I hope that issue will be done as soon as possible
I BELIEVE IN YOU
#JYPfaith
2053 2018-05-02 04:36:46 goodnight I hope jyp stocks get back to their original value asap and that issa gets her acc back
2054 2018-05-02 04:36:14 Hmm seems like JYP stans are going for their own cover-up then. The stocks for the company are already downward spiraling. Probably hasn’t even been covered in the news yet.
2055 2018-05-02 04:34:33 If JYPE stocks are dropping. I dont think JYPE will put Twice into mess. Theyre the the ones who can save them. Idk about what dispatch will do.
2056 2018-05-02 04:34:20 "Why do I invest in @BSESME stocks? Because the possibility that the small can grow big faster seems  more real to me than the possibility of the big growing even bigger on the same scale in the same time frame." Anonymous SME investor. @ashishchauhan @porinju

2058 2018-05-02 04:31:31 @HillaryClinton would be in the stocks
2059 2018-05-02 04:31:06 Okay can people calm down??  Dispatch is a piece of shit that we’ve been known but even tho the stocks are having a drop right now, JYPs PR team is better than most handling scandals, I do believe this is going to blow over in a few weeks SPECIALLY once JYP presses charges
2060 2018-05-02 04:30:45 No! Its point was to reflate **asset markets**. The CBs were explicit about this: push people out of bonds and into stocks, by lowering long-term interest rates. It was not about causing banks to be able to lend more.
2061 2018-05-02 04:29:21 BITCH THE STOCKS WERE DECREASING??? WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK KAJAKAHSKSJ
2062 2018-05-02 04:27:45 jyps stocks are already down?????

2068 2018-05-02 04:25:47 stocks can go up again.
2069 2018-05-02 04:25:43 yeees uwu it can affect the artists cause I heard jyp stocks are going down  ㅇㅅㅇ

2073 2018-05-02 04:23:18 PLEASE HIS STOCKS DROPPED 10% IN LESS THAN AN HOUR
2074 2018-05-02 04:22:54 JYPE'S STOCKS LITERAKLY DROPPED I'M SCREAMING KFKDJAJSJFJFJFJSJAJSU
2075 2018-05-02 04:22:35 Jyp stocks went down a lot, losing about 11%
2076 2018-05-02 04:22:21 their stocks crashed too 
2077 2018-05-02 04:21:33 European stocks made light gains on Tuesday, although trading activity was thin with most major markets closed for the May Day holiday. @BP_plc jumped 1.8% after its earnings won investor approval, Shell lost 0.4%, @RollsRoyce dipped 0.1% and HSBC rose 0.5%.
2078 2018-05-02 04:21:32 shit jype stocks rly are dropping uh UH UHHHHH protect the artists please :(
2079 2018-05-02 04:20:43 US stocks ended mostly higher on Tuesday, led by gains in the big techs ahead of Apple's results and as investors eyed the start of the May meeting of the Federal Reserve.
2080 2018-05-02 04:20:26 save the kids juiceyo :( srsly the company stocks are falling fast
2081 2018-05-02 04:20:06 Basically JYP is involved with a religious cult linked to the Sewol Ferry Tragedy. That means he may be partly responsible for what happened. Now the company stocks are dropping. This will also be really bad for all the people working for him including idols.
2082 2018-05-02 04:20:02 Why is it different than any other investment?

Stocks? Bonds? Real estate? Commodities?

Why should you allocate more time to crypto than those?
2083 2018-05-02 04:19:45 Everyone's getting so shocked @ jyp's stocks but I'm pretty they'll balance out tomorrow once JYP releases an official statement. Investors pull out their shares and sell them just in case the rumor doesn't blow over.
2084 2018-05-02 04:19:27 ooh the stocks are increasing again, yes pls
2085 2018-05-02 04:17:26 None? So, most of the academic research in these topics is wrong? Naturally we do not have a bubble now. People just want to buy stocks at 31xearnings and lend to Italy for 10 years with 1,8%. "Permanently high plateau..."
2086 2018-05-02 04:17:24 such beautiful entrances. $DIRV is one of those stocks where you buy when you can, and sell 1,000s%%% later not even caring where u bought
2087 2018-05-02 04:17:24 Exactly, and jyp was an artist he knows how much badly it can affect his artists, stocks etc
2088 2018-05-02 04:17:19 Ok JYP saved, all artists saved, the stocks also are going up again  #JYPFaith
2089 2018-05-02 04:16:59 With all this JYP scandal we can’t confirm anything but since the stocks are dropping at a fast rate, I’m worried about the artist, hopefully this will get resolved soon
2090 2018-05-02 04:16:04 I am really hoping for more gains. With the penny stocks a lot of volitality. I am short term with MTP.
2091 2018-05-02 04:15:22 JYPE stocks going up again like some lovers that got back together after breaking up on impulse
2092 2018-05-02 04:14:57 @CalSTRS Stop funding teachers’ retirement with money made on the backs of children. Divest from gun stocks. #DivestForOurLives
2093 2018-05-02 04:14:08 So jyp is in a cult group?

And upon hearing this, JYP's stocks fell?

What in the world is happening in JYP entertainment?
2094 2018-05-02 04:13:51 Yea but I saw jyp's stocks have decreased like a hell lot, so it seems like people are really taking this seriously
2095 2018-05-02 04:13:43 not to mention how many groups and artists are at risk because of the company’s stocks plummeting
twice
day6
got7
stray kids
suzy 
to only name a few

this is actually serious okay
2096 2018-05-02 04:13:26 Save TWICE and GOT7!  JYP's stocks went down, it's gonna affect their artists.
2097 2018-05-02 04:12:25 Wtf their stocks are dropped so much...
2098 2018-05-02 04:11:42 I think bump stocks are unnecessary, I’m OK with banning them. But I’d like to point out that we already have folks with illegal fully automatic weapons on the streets. If you don’t think this is true, check NYE when dozens of idiots are emptying clips into the sky.
2099 2018-05-02 04:11:17 The top 7-8 stocks account for 75% of portfolio of #BerkshireHathaway . Keep it simple @Iamsamirarora
2100 2018-05-02 04:10:49 I can make this money flip and I ain’t even into stocks. 
2101 2018-05-02 04:10:39 Luckily the stocks went back a bit. Stay strong our Daddy

2103 2018-05-02 04:10:13 im crying about jyps situation right now :( their stocks is alr decreasing and the artists might be also affected 
2104 2018-05-02 04:08:37 In all honesty for the sake of JYPE artists I hope JYP isn’t really affiliated with that cult because the way the company stocks have dropped and it’s barely been a few hours since the pictures were posted is honestly worrying.
2105 2018-05-02 04:08:27 Nakakastress tignan nung pag taas-baba ng stocks ng JYPE ngayon
2106 2018-05-02 04:08:17 The vegas killer took out hundreds. Just goes to show how much more dangerous guns are then any other weapon. Besides, we need autosmobikes, they serve a purpose for their risk. Military style rifles, extended clips, bump stocks, serve NO PURPOSE except to kill. C the diff ?

2111 2018-05-02 04:06:55 no, they'll be fine. i was worried since got7 is my ult, but with how everything is going so far there shouldn't be much problems. stocks dropped but that would go up again soon and that's pretty much the effect of the scandal. nothing else lmao
2112 2018-05-02 04:06:43 .@whitehouse @realdonaldtrump: Your bump stock regulations will place you to the left of the gun-hating Obama on this issue. I stand with @GunOwners and urge you to not regulate bump stocks.
2113 2018-05-02 04:06:43 .@whitehouse @realdonaldtrump: You've tweeted before that the "Second Amendment will never be repealed." But that's just what your bump stock regulations will effectively do! I stand with @GunOwners and urge you to not regulate bump stocks.

2115 2018-05-02 04:06:25 media company who always posts false rumors to start shit claimed jyp is in a cult that is linked to very serious stuff and now jype stocks are dropping so fast and their artists could be affected bc of this if they lose business but jyp posted and said its not true
2116 2018-05-02 04:06:05 I'm freaking out over this, I can only imagine what the artists are feeling. The stocks plummeting like that is a terrible sign. Just terrible. The damage this is doing will be felt in waves.
2117 2018-05-02 04:05:23 it was reported by dispatch and the company stocks have already dropped djjd
2118 2018-05-02 04:05:12 Then what will happen to the people who invest systematically into stocks if it crashes.  In India people deposit into stocks like fixed deposits.
2119 2018-05-02 04:05:02 he rly wrote a whole essay omg im scared for jype artists bro stocks already went down by so much
2120 2018-05-02 04:04:00 Bdsosbsosbs jyp’s stocks are dropping omo momo nooo
2121 2018-05-02 04:03:53 according to dispatch apparently jyp was involved with the cult that was behind sewol ferry incident so his stocks are going down.
2122 2018-05-02 04:02:11 @Stockabilities @DavisVegas it’s not that simple but lots more fun then trading stocks. People say higher risk more reward. I say lower risk
2123 2018-05-02 04:02:06 Auto stocks will be watched after April sales outcome
2124 2018-05-02 04:01:07 And you know anything about this or if you ever read anything related about this topic, you would know that this will affect the artist in the company. First just to inform you, JYP is not the CEO, second it will affect the artist because their stocks is doppung
2125 2018-05-02 04:01:01 Before isro s mangalyaan touch the mars, our stocks #mcap will touch it.

2131 2018-05-02 03:57:29 Not how it took jyp les than a minute to respond to the claims once his stocks or whatever they're called were dropping
2132 2018-05-02 03:57:13 The damage has been done.. their stocks went down so fast.
2133 2018-05-02 03:56:19 His stocks crashed so hard....if he’s involved.....

But even if he wasn’t, it might hardly matter. JYP is apart of a BIG scandal now. I don’t think he’d be able to live this down easily. Geez.
2134 2018-05-02 03:55:58 yup :( the stocks have plummeted too, everythinhs getting messier as the seconds tick by

2152 2018-05-02 03:50:20 The top 10% that own 80% of stocks in this country. ENOUGH with party. We all need to get on the same side of this. It’s not partisan. They just need to divide us .
2153 2018-05-02 03:50:18 JYP's stocks are plummeting  we gotta save Day6 and Twice they ain't going down with them
2154 2018-05-02 03:49:52 In all honesty all theyre going off of are some paparazzi photos and rumours about his late wife, so he could very easily not be religious in the slightest. Either way, it's already majorly affected JYPE company stocks and JYP says he plans on taking legal action for defamation.

2157 2018-05-02 03:47:09 JYP (The Man) is linked a cult run by the man who owns the Sewol Ferry. The JYP companies stocks are dropping rapidly

2160 2018-05-02 03:46:12 Bitcoin was used for buying mail order drugs until cool bros started to buy it up like stocks which drove the price up

2162 2018-05-02 03:46:00 JYP's stocks are plummeting... yikes
2163 2018-05-02 03:45:40 according to dispatch apparently jyp was involved with the cult that was behind sewol ferry incident so his stocks are going down and we’re off to buy the groups!
2164 2018-05-02 03:44:47 JYPs stocks are dropping hella fast
2165 2018-05-02 03:44:38 this is a really bad time for dispatch to be playing like that, jyp’s stocks are plummeting and stray kids just debuted recently which could possibly affect them.
2166 2018-05-02 03:44:31 the tea on samsung: 

samsung biologist is involved in another scandal; the company breached accounting rules (which is a serous offense) thus their stocks drops more than 5%.

dispatch used jyp to cover up this scandal.
2167 2018-05-02 03:44:28 sdkjndsn me too, the company's stocks dropped so fast
2168 2018-05-02 03:44:23 Basically he was found to be in a cult and using that status to avoid paying taxes..... jyp stocks are crashing big time right now

2174 2018-05-02 03:41:43 Stocks have 100-200 years of history to look at. Bitcoin has 9. If you think it’s a guarantee, you’re kidding yourself.
2175 2018-05-02 03:41:36 The only way it would affect the artists is if it keeps plummenting, but if the stocks level out they'll be fine, honestly bighit just needs to swoop in and buy jyp
2176 2018-05-02 03:41:30 it’s too damn late damage has been done and they stocks dropped so

2182 2018-05-02 03:40:10 If you argue that stock volatility is not risk, you must also state that stocks are potentially a very illiquid asset class.

2207 2018-05-02 03:35:02 Dispatch exposed jyp for being a member of a cult. Jype's stocks dropped fast. Jyp denied it and is apparently planning to sue dispatch
2208 2018-05-02 03:34:20 My mom had a chance to buy stocks in Apple back in ‘85 but she didn’t because she never thought computing would take off
2209 2018-05-02 03:33:42 I really hope that he has no connections with them  and dispatch is soooo fucked if that's the case look at jype stocks bfhjdch
2210 2018-05-02 03:33:26 The JYPE stocks are rising?!
2211 2018-05-02 03:32:44 omg his stocks are dropping

2214 2018-05-02 03:32:34 Apparently Dispatch released something regarding about JYP being in a cult, and the stocks are dropping in such rate. JYP already released a statement regarding this.
2215 2018-05-02 03:32:27 JYP stocks are going down yooo...
2216 2018-05-02 03:31:50 Not only JYP stocks are going down but SM’s (not that much tho) because Bae Yong Joon has 4% of SM’s shares (remember he sold SM his part of KeyEast)
2217 2018-05-02 03:31:49 he’s like...possibly part of a cult and stocks are dropping
2218 2018-05-02 03:31:24 JYP stocks plummeting oh my god someone do damage control up in this bitch

2220 2018-05-02 03:31:14 Jyp is In a cult created by the sewol ferry owner, and jype is dropping stocks faster than snsd drop in the boys
2221 2018-05-02 03:31:01 Stocks are very volatile, if this gets cleared up and JYP is innocent like he claims then everything will be fine
2222 2018-05-02 03:30:49 jyp is reported to be in a cult that had to do with the sewol ferry and stocks are dropping like hell but he’s posted on instagram saying that’s not the case
2223 2018-05-02 03:30:48 if this isn't true I hope jyp declines the issue FAST cause this brings big negative impact both the company itself and the artists i've already seen a picture of stocks reducing in massive rates THE ARTISTS DON'T DESERVE ANY OF THIS. JYP FCKING TAKE ACTION OR ELSE
2224 2018-05-02 03:30:09 Same :((

2233 2018-05-02 03:28:26 now, i'm seeing that jype's stocks/charts are dropping. please  don't let this affect the artists, please. they've done nothing wrong. 
2234 2018-05-02 03:28:07 Something about him being in a cult? It'll drop the jyp ent stocks and hurt all the artists
2235 2018-05-02 03:27:58 Listen I just hope what he said calms the situation and the stocks stop dropping
2236 2018-05-02 03:27:08 Jyp stocks drop 8% this is bad.
2237 2018-05-02 03:27:01 look up jyp cult or jyp stocks dropping
2238 2018-05-02 03:26:49 jyp’s stocks are dropping really fast every minute passing, and that could affect all the artists in the ent. so like he needs to make a statement and fix this shit aSAP

2254 2018-05-02 03:22:28 BASICALLY he's part of a cult that could've prevented that tragedy which is still a very fresh wound to the korean people so now that it's proven that he's in some shady cult.. ESP THAT ONE.... JYP ENT's stocks are falling like crazy and there's definitely gonna be repercussions
2255 2018-05-02 03:22:28 Why are the jyp stocks dropping what happened
2256 2018-05-02 03:22:06 Double digit MoM growth in air traffic in India over the last 3.5 years or so, will most probably continue for several years. But you don’t have to own airline stocks to benefit from this trend. So many ways to play this. #NSE #BSE
2257 2018-05-02 03:21:55 jyp stocks dropped like 10% im-
2258 2018-05-02 03:21:28 Occasionally, it pays to be in backwards town, USA. 
Example: When someone stocks the Stella Artois under the $11.99 sticker instead of the $17.99 sticker. 
Dum Dums. I win.
2259 2018-05-02 03:21:11 IDK. But I saw tweets about JYPE dropping stocks because of a news.
2260 2018-05-02 03:21:10 quick everyone sell your jyp stocks before its TOO TOO late
2261 2018-05-02 03:21:08 omg the stocks are plummeting. it's over. omg what the actual fck.
2262 2018-05-02 03:21:02 JYPE stocks drop a lot
2263 2018-05-02 03:20:54 what the fuck am i hearing about jyps stocks dropping
2264 2018-05-02 03:20:40 I’m concerned about the stocks dropping and the artists’ tbh
2265 2018-05-02 03:20:38 jype stocks are just like my patience
2266 2018-05-02 03:20:33 $Akao doesn’t have a sales force maybe because they have a buyout offer contingent on a Plazo approval.
2267 2018-05-02 03:20:33 The reason why you are not seeing a ramp in $AKAO is that they most likely will be sold. You don’t create a sales force after approval, you build once prior to approval... so you get out of the gates running.
2268 2018-05-02 03:20:05 Rocking my new clothing brand lonely and dry Whatsapp, unlimited stocks .

2273 2018-05-02 03:19:38 the jyp stock will be Added to my followed stocks from two years ago when i was really into stats for like a month
2274 2018-05-02 03:19:32 How is Nifty looking?  
If you are asking - It is just not falling :-) Prefer it over banknifty

Above 10700, prepare for 10880-10900. 

Below 10600, Bears will come back for pullback.

2322 2018-05-02 03:04:28 JYP's stocks are dropping at such a fast rate omg
2323 2018-05-02 03:04:22 .@whitehouse @realdonaldtrump: I urge you to rein in the ATF's regulations on bump stocks. I agree with @GunOwners that these regulations will criminalize millions of law-abiding gun owners!
2324 2018-05-02 03:03:42 Would it be plausible for $AKAO to raise capital post-approval? I know they're still sitting on >$100MM, but their burn rate is high already and they'll need to amp it up for C-Scape/plazo sales force. Plus, if plazo sales slump out the gate, they'd have to raise at a bad price.

2326 2018-05-02 03:03:21 Legends twicesus didn’t bust their ass everyday working back and forth between Korea and Japan to give insane profit for the company only for jyp to drop stocks so carelessly ...
2327 2018-05-02 03:02:39 I am very disappointed that we are debating a law making Bump stocks unlawful in CT and I agree with that law. It's the fact that the proponent failed to answer how many Bump Stocks are in CT Also what will we do to legal gun owners if this law passes? Maybe making them criminals
2328 2018-05-02 03:02:36 Yup, no MOMO stocks anymore. Can't even trust earnings anymore. Tuff market.

2333 2018-05-02 03:00:31 So stock value represents all the financial and trading investments put into a company. And like winning the lottery, a small percentage investors can acquire the greater value of those collected stocks, while many others many lose their investments to those stocks?

2443 2018-05-02 02:16:19 You may be right. I should have stated that at TD Ameritrade, OTC stocks typically are non-marginable.  There may be a different outcome with other firms.  Thanks for checking with us.  Have a great day!  ^ZJ
2444 2018-05-02 02:15:56 They will be banning bump stocks and they won't be grandfathered in, that means people have to turn them with no compensation or they will be felons. Some states want to do the same with AR-15's, so that would gun confiscation.

2462 2018-05-02 02:02:22 Have been trading differently as of late; buying long term OTC stocks that I don’t have to worry about as often while building my business.  It’s been interesting looking for OTCs that are promising in a longer time frame.  Thinking about doing a video.
2463 2018-05-02 02:01:48 Yes & not a single person or the Brewers projected this type of dominance in BP. They put him there for the same BS projections. U can’t have it both ways. In doing so u are saying this is not what he truly is but considering Sterns was part of the group who traded him here!
2464 2018-05-02 02:01:09 .@whitehouse @realdonaldtrump: Your bump stock regulations will place you to the left of the gun-hating Obama on this issue. I stand with @GunOwners and urge you to not regulate bump stocks.
2465 2018-05-02 01:59:47 Doubt it. Stephen Paddock had several different types of guns with bump stocks on them. He wasn’t even there. He was across the street and 30 something floors up. Nobody knew where it was coming from until it was too late. Including the police, they were looking for him too.
2466 2018-05-02 01:59:38 He has to, 90% of traders fail especially buying junk stocks with little to no natural volume and chasing.

2470 2018-05-02 01:55:05 .@whitehouse @realdonaldtrump: You've tweeted before that the "Second Amendment will never be repealed." But that's just what your bump stock regulations will effectively do! I stand with @GunOwners and urge you to not regulate bump stocks.
2471 2018-05-02 01:54:34 .@whitehouse @realdonaldtrump: I urge you to rein in the @ATFHQ's regulations on bump stocks. I agree with @GunOwners that these regulations will criminalize millions of law-abiding gun owners and will do nothing to help the mentally ill which should be your focus!  #2A

2476 2018-05-02 01:52:52 To everyone saying he is...He is clearly not wrong. This is speculation- the same exact way stocks were speculation before they became the norm. It’s okay it find something before it’s established, but don’t convince yourself it is just because you want that.

2481 2018-05-02 01:50:23 PhRMA is a profit-oriented group, each one spending >$10 Billion more per year on sales & marketing (ads, gifts, etc.) than they do on drug research & development. They should be non-profit, unable to sell stocks, which makes them beholden to shareholders, not patients.
2482 2018-05-02 01:47:54 So projections had Francisco Lindor as a power hitting SS hitting 30 bombs? NO! Greinke and his 5 ERA in his first 57 starts....moved him to the BP & realized they made a mistake & moved him back. Baseball Gms, scouts & mgrs get fired all the time for wrong projections.

2485 2018-05-02 01:44:40 I do care one way or another as I am not wanting one.  What I want is CT legislation to pass a budget so seniors can get care and our youth get healthcare and an education. Talking bump stocks will not get that done.

2490 2018-05-02 01:37:31 This is silly, the largest manufacturer of bump stocks has stopped production and they make the rifle way less accurate due to muzzle rise.  We need a budget and road infrastructure, not a progressive agenda item.

2495 2018-05-02 01:31:37 The Koch’s can’t buy back their own stocks because they already own them. Their company is privately held. The tweet was referring to publicly traded companies like Chevron or 3M. That’s why it’s such good news. Good news is much better than fake news 
2496 2018-05-02 01:30:53 Wasn’t the idea to hire workers? Pay workers more? Bring jobs to America? workers spend money and grow the economy! all this is is the government borrowing money to refund tax money so that these companies can buy their own stocks and inflate their worth..economy wasn’t helped
2497 2018-05-02 01:30:53 And to think, this massive short squeeze will continue as long as the $TLNUF shares are still waiting to convert. $AXXA could easily be over $1 by time that happens.

2545 2018-05-02 00:54:41 Hmm, I wonder if anyone has told him that it doesn’t have any cash flow, can’t grow earnings, or pay dividends?... Surely an S&P index fund makes more sense.

He’s a billionaire and I’m not though, so perhaps shame on me.

2577 2018-05-02 00:29:16 You don’t need socks cause the stocks look cleaner
2578 2018-05-02 00:28:28 $CCUR recent insider buys, moving up to fill gap after recent selloff. #stocks This would be a swing trade idea. Need to be carful in this current climate with swing trades. Looking for volume and a bullish green candle

2583 2018-05-02 00:22:39 Did you people read Apple’s report out today?! Their buy back stocks to be be given back to shareholders because of the tax cuts! That’s right EVERY American has stock in Apple or any other stock for that matter! The @GOP and @HouseGOP are a SCAM!

2586 2018-05-02 00:21:57 Sounds like a recipe for running in place at best, but in my 25 years watching markets, I’ve noticed the tendency for stocks to feel a headwind in any persistent rate hike environment at least until there is visibility to the end of rate hikes (if not slightly beyond that)
2587 2018-05-02 00:21:55 Also . . . all good entry points for bonds.  Stocks . . . not so much.

2594 2018-05-02 00:16:37 The fact is that there are 1000s of AR15s in the state that have not been registered for fear of confiscation. You still cannot call the @CT_STATE_POLICE and get an accurate answer if a gun is legal laws are so complex. Not a fan myself of bump stocks, a novelty.

2596 2018-05-02 00:15:35 Nope, there is a limit, once you hit a particular amount boom, you dont pay anymore. And for some reason if you are getting money from stocks you only pay 14 percent.

The poor and middle class create actual demand which makes everyone prosper. The corps invest to meet demand, more jobs, higher paying jobs etc. Supply side and trickle down don’t.
