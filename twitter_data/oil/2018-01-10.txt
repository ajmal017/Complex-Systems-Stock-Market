The reason Florida is exempt from oil exploration is because the other state's beaches don't hold a candle to Florida's pristine beautiful beaches! Can't begin to compare!

14 2018-01-10 23:59:00 It is necessary to have offshore drilling in the state of California. Thank God that Florida is exempt. We the People have to push Drilling in California. It has abundance of oil. Therefore we don't have to buy from the Middle East.

Wonder what would happen if someone offered Trump interest in a oil well off the FL coast.
42 2018-01-10 23:58:11 The proper response from “big oil” would be to suspend all sales and all transfers of oil products to any entity, public or private, in the mayor’s jurisdiction.
43 2018-01-10 23:57:46 The oil he recommended apparently eliminates all shuddering

46 2018-01-10 23:57:31 Well I'm a little confused, where does this fuel oil come from? Ah yes I forgot it's grown off trees, just like all the money your party likes to tax....
47 2018-01-10 23:57:22 You made in great in 2017? Wow, we in the UK had brexit and the pound fell, the dollar vs pound though since you.. well, Good luck with your oil plans. Despite the fact that it's a stop gap. For like 2-3 years.

56 2018-01-10 23:56:40 Regardless whether you agree/disagree on offshore oil drilling, to exempt Florida is so self-serving to @realDonaldTrump and his billionaire friends.  I really thought it couldn’t get worse under this loser of a president. Get on those tennis shoes and keep fighting, Sen Murray.

73 2018-01-10 23:54:55 Yup. When you put a new coil make sure you curated 1st. Put oil on the sides and on the top. Hit it but blow air into the tip. Do that a couple of times than inhale. It'll be ok after that

76 2018-01-10 23:54:40 So you sell oil stocks but continue to use their products huh?  Cars, planes, electricity, heat, I guess you will continue using them but just sue the companies.  What a joke - it’s a transparent publicity stunt.

78 2018-01-10 23:54:37 I make a curried fried “rice” out of it. I wok it up in some coconut oil, Chief® brand curry powder and Braggs® Amino acid as the soy sauce. If I’m feeling froggy, I’ll add some TJ’s chicken skrips
79 2018-01-10 23:54:34 Oh, and they are divesting from oil.
80 2018-01-10 23:54:17 If we have to drill for oil in the US ...

86 2018-01-10 23:53:33 3. Now the condebsate produced is lease condensate and that is classed as crude oil not as NGL’s. As the gas is dryer and cooler going to the gas plant after it produces less plant condensate which is an ngl. So in colder weather you are producing more crude and less NGL’s.
87 2018-01-10 23:53:30 Coconut oil is awesome for skin :)
88 2018-01-10 23:53:07 Trump doesn't believe in climate change.  He thinks we have a never-ending supply of oil and that all we have to do is keep drilling instead of exploring renewable energy sources.
89 2018-01-10 23:53:03 And we know that if the country’s ressources were turnips instead of oil and gas the US would not have gone in this way.
90 2018-01-10 23:52:42 Wow. Almost as if EVERY State has its own voice. And many of them seem opposed to having oil rigs near their beautiful shorelines. Hmm 
91 2018-01-10 23:52:40 Not sure if I like this or not BUT I'm pretty sure I need to see some oil next time
92 2018-01-10 23:52:37 In addition to air & water pollution, FRACKING increases the potential for oil spills which can harm the soil & surrounding vegetation. Fracking may cause earthquakes due to high pressure used to extract oil& gas from rock & the storage of excess wastewater on site.- Investopedia
93 2018-01-10 23:52:30 He excuses Florida , because it’s a tourist destination. What’s California. Can’t wait to drive up PCH to be greeted by oil rigs. Goodbye beautiful coastline. And the same will be true of all our coastal waters. So very sad what this president is allowing to happen.

97 2018-01-10 23:52:01 Fascinating. One query. You assume that the fiscal take in SEEngland is accurate. Is it? Does it value eg Scots oil, Welsh water/wind?

101 2018-01-10 23:51:31 Nice...
102 2018-01-10 23:51:11 But you said you keep campaign promises, like paying off donors and destroying the US coast with oil drilling.  YOU PROMISED MEXICO would pay for your wall.  Are you saying you don't keep promises?  Or only rich people promises.
103 2018-01-10 23:51:07 Trump and the republicans just don't care.  as long as they can see short-term profits, the long-term effect doesn't bother them.  that's why we're now drilling in the Arctic Refuge and virtually all safeguards for off-shore oil drilling are gone.

108 2018-01-10 23:50:25 This is insane. How about the oil companies stop selling petroleum products to them and see what happens then. The whole city would shut down. So what percentage of alternative fuel vehicles does the city use. And what type of vehicle does the Mayer ride around in?
109 2018-01-10 23:50:24 I normally don't like my oily skin, but I am glad I have it even in the winter time because that moment I'm outside, and it's negative something degrees, and I feel my skin start to crack... a horrible feeling. But then the oil comes through clutch.
110 2018-01-10 23:50:17 When I first learned how to change oil in a car, I was taught to pour the old oil out around the garage to kill the weeds.

146 2018-01-10 23:45:41 Don’t go to .@Valvoline folks. Got an oil change yesterday. Left squeaking. Complained. Got told to come in. Two hours “we didn’t do this” and useless “work” on my car later I have to go to a mechanic to fix what they messed up
147 2018-01-10 23:45:27 TBF, .@RepStevePearce is quitting to run for governor in a blue state. He’s a trump/gas/oil  lemming, #NM disgrace. 

He will not win. Good riddance.
148 2018-01-10 23:45:23 You should use CBD oil do the research #CBB #StayHealthy
149 2018-01-10 23:45:06 Have been waiting for that to happen. Its what big oil companies want so they can control the direction of the Paris agreement.
150 2018-01-10 23:45:04 High end skincare companies really mix rosehip oil & Vitamin e together & charge $68 a bottle for it.
151 2018-01-10 23:45:00 Ban all oil products in your city.
152 2018-01-10 23:44:50 Tried to be productive after work and change my oil only to find the drain plugs stripped.
153 2018-01-10 23:44:40 There's a good lad. Now just exempt the other 4 coastlines from oil and gas development, restore the monuments and the lead shot ban, and history will honor you for being more than just another Trump-looney.
154 2018-01-10 23:44:33 Fucking hot oil burns! Ahhh! There go any plans I had to write tonight.
155 2018-01-10 23:44:24 Nothing but a publicity stunt to promote Governor Scott. It also prevents oil spillage at Mar-a-largo. Bastard.
156 2018-01-10 23:44:09 I live in Houston, schooled in Austin and agree that Houston is good place to live. Considered most culturally diverse city in US. Since breaking away form mostly "oil" it has expanded and thrived. Housing reasonable, world class restaurants and med center.
157 2018-01-10 23:44:09 Wake up! Rise up! We need people now! We'll lose our national treasures/iconic wildlife to these soulless greedy dirty extractive industries toxic mining, fracking, oil drilling, clear-cutting timber on our public lands causing irreversible damage! Call congress (202) 224-3121 RT
158 2018-01-10 23:43:56 I didn't realize that Donald Trump was so broke that half of Americans think he's going to be working on an Exxon oil rig somewhere in the nation by 2018!
159 2018-01-10 23:43:53 We need to provide incentives for those trying to develop alternative energy cars. 45 seems inclined to keep big oil in business for as long as possible. Now we're going to drill off all coasts.
160 2018-01-10 23:43:23 So what do you think of Trump's removal of protections to wildlife? Further endangering of many species to allow mining and oil extraction - is that what you voted for?
161 2018-01-10 23:43:17 Can anyone help me do an oil change today :(
162 2018-01-10 23:43:13 what the fuck! I've taken enough MCT Oil in the last 48 hrs to render me incapable of walking
163 2018-01-10 23:43:05 Olbas oil is quite good to Susan x i put a few drops on my pillow case at night and it helps to clear my nose..
164 2018-01-10 23:43:04 I think the oil rig should go right in front of Mar-a-lago in Florida. Let Trump have the best view of metal when he entertains his guests.
165 2018-01-10 23:43:02 We need $200/ oil to get out of the hole we’re in.
166 2018-01-10 23:43:01 I've heard its good for everything.. like coconut oil is.  I rinse my hair with vinegar. Leaves it squeaky clean & shiny!
167 2018-01-10 23:42:54 Believe me, she is not representing the people, they are more worried about filling their pockets at all cost to the people
168 2018-01-10 23:42:54 I need more olive oil
169 2018-01-10 23:42:39 She really needs to stop selling snake oil to people.
170 2018-01-10 23:42:33 Will NYC cease using oil and anything produced via oil?
171 2018-01-10 23:42:28 Yes, as a country we need oil to continue to grow but ruining wildlife refuge and natural resources is not the answer
172 2018-01-10 23:42:24 Sounds like the basic definition of a bigot to me.
173 2018-01-10 23:42:11 @realDonaldTrump you serious? Libel laws? This is what you do with your seat as president, make it easier to sue Gawker.  You're a snake oil salesman in a cheap, un-ironed suit. Go eat your fast food and kiss Fox News ass. Oh wait does your libel laws include that hack TV?
174 2018-01-10 23:42:09 Coconut oil = loml
175 2018-01-10 23:41:54  coconut oil and almond oil do wonders 
176 2018-01-10 23:41:53 I dribbled @AaronGoesToTown's New Year's honey mustard on a shirt and it seems to have left an oil stain. We told him there was too much mayo. 
177 2018-01-10 23:41:51 It’s a shakedown worthy of the Mafia (but will fail). Most of the top 20 oil companies are state owned. This will go nowhere (except for the potential counter suit).
178 2018-01-10 23:41:49 Where’s my States waiver for oil drilling?

NOW, WHO COULDN’T SEE THIS COMING?

@realDonaldTrump gave @FLGovScott a pass & whiny Floridian @GOP followed suit @marcorubio 

BEGINNING to see CAVING by @POTUS for political maneuvering & election fears, DACA

#MAGA OR GO HOME
179 2018-01-10 23:41:43 Norway has 4 trillion sovereign wealth fund derived from FOSSIL FUEL. 
Tiny country, uses very little oil/gas.
Easy to comply for them
180 2018-01-10 23:41:22 OIL DIFF: 5.84 -> 5.84
181 2018-01-10 23:41:05 Oh and Florida is most likely the state with the most oil off the coast.
182 2018-01-10 23:40:57 Tell Trump to build a wall between USA and Canada. Or maybe you have a plan to invade Canada for oil!
183 2018-01-10 23:40:50 Coyotes appear to be all in on trying to out Oil the Oilers. Imagine Dahlin and OEL together?
184 2018-01-10 23:40:45 #Ireland has plenty of oil, just the government gave most of it to the #Norwegians #SovereignIreland
185 2018-01-10 23:40:45 Governors should sue. Jersey shore will be ruined as will Carolinas, Delaware, Virginia, California, Oregon.
Who wants to go to a beach and see oil equipment?
186 2018-01-10 23:40:45 Andrew, in African countries which have no natural energy resources of their own, renewable generation is commercially profitable and competitive with expensive alternatives such as diesel and heavy fuel oil. I develop power in Africa for a living.
187 2018-01-10 23:40:44 During the presidents first year he has lied about 3000 times. He has denied DACA citizens the right to not have to live in fear, he has called white supremacist very fine people, he has allowed our waters and air to be compromised and given away our national parks to big oil
188 2018-01-10 23:40:44 Thank you!!! Also, NEVER use tea tree oil on anything ever. It’s highly toxic to cats. It’s one of the most harmful oils you can use!
189 2018-01-10 23:40:41 Son of a hash oil pen.
190 2018-01-10 23:40:37 Perhaps it has to do with the location of POTUS's favorite golf course. Can't tee off with oil rigs in the distance.
191 2018-01-10 23:40:35 America needs to drill all of the oil that we can. That oil won't do any good in the ground. The one "from the North", Russia, is surrounded by oil. America, our great President Trump is supporting Israel; God's chosen! Pray for and support our President! Jesus is coming soon!
192 2018-01-10 23:40:33 OIL DIFF: 5.81 -> 5.84
193 2018-01-10 23:40:25 Hey Tucker, that guy you had on first was trying to blow smoke up your a__. All of that crap that “family’s need to be together” Tell that to a GI or oil worker. The Bracero Program 1942-1964 worked pretty well. A modern version that OSHA was involved with is the answer.
194 2018-01-10 23:40:23 Day two of the patch. 
A little bit of a craving. Drinking water/eating chocolate almonds/chewing gum helps some.
CBD oil helps with the nausea.
195 2018-01-10 23:40:18 if oil drilling isnt an industry where did they get asphalt to pave roads in midgar
196 2018-01-10 23:40:16 Gee the just announced in pa heating oil and gas are being increased. So thanks again for nothing
197 2018-01-10 23:40:10 Endless oil story
198 2018-01-10 23:40:04 Except I don't over-tighten my oil pan plug and strip it, causing a leak. Commonplace with the yokels most places hire. Save $5 and piece of mind.
199 2018-01-10 23:39:54 Good.  They're all a bunch a crooks and they're trying to destroy the planet with their greed.  No offshore oil drilling.  NONE! 
200 2018-01-10 23:39:43 Some ppl have a crush on u b/c of ur oil, b/c of the anointing on ur life. Be mindful  God will let u know who loves YOU not just ur oil
201 2018-01-10 23:39:41 So you're saying oil drilling is punitive, that you recognize how destructive it is to local economies (since human health seems to escape your notice). Funny thing to admit.
202 2018-01-10 23:39:35 Watching back today v prior live statements by @realDonaldTrump. I just gotta ask? Who's bought his BULLSHIT ever? He's ALWAYS been the definition of a snake oil salesman.
203 2018-01-10 23:39:22 I’m waiting to get my medicine and this mom in front of me is talking about getting her son lub cause he used al her baby oil 
204 2018-01-10 23:39:22 Oil dey your head soon come!!!
205 2018-01-10 23:39:15 How about all the other states voicing opposition? Come on... you’re a joke. Get in this century. The environment matters more than your big oil interests! Focus forward or the States will be left behind the rest of the world... you old dinosaurs!
206 2018-01-10 23:39:13 Oil dey your head bruv 
207 2018-01-10 23:39:04 I put Peppermint Oil in my humidifier and it works so well!
208 2018-01-10 23:39:02 You love numbers, remember you only have 32% of the country fooled with your snake oil Democracy...
209 2018-01-10 23:39:00 Reason #37383929 why sian should break up with her boyfriend and be with me instead : he thought that vegetable oil won’t cook chicken so you use “meat oil” instead (& he does btec sport)
210 2018-01-10 23:38:56 Finally, someone is suing the oil companies. Every person who lost a home, a job, family in Louisiana, Puerto Rico should file class action.
211 2018-01-10 23:38:48 Getting an oil change and I feel like I’m cheating on my Father. He’s the best and only mechanic I’ve ever known... #adulting #daddysgirl
212 2018-01-10 23:38:45 Sudafed and huff peppermint oil :P
213 2018-01-10 23:38:42 @FLGovScott So RINO when it comes to offshore oil production in your state?  Ever hear of NIMBY? (Not in my backyard). FL residents use a lot of oil and they shouldn't participate in finding and producing? I am a staunch Republican but it seems you are one selfish RINO governor
214 2018-01-10 23:38:19 America needs to drill all of the oil that we can. That oil won't do any good in the ground. The one "from the North", Russia, is surrounded by oil. America, our great President Trump is supporting Israel, God's chosen! Pray for our President! Jesus is coming soon!
215 2018-01-10 23:38:17 Pruitt is the WORST person on this planet.  He should be the one to soak in pesticides & petroleum oil instead of children and animals.  He's literally doing the opposite of what he is supposed to be doing. 
216 2018-01-10 23:38:14 Plus it doesn’t even make sense from a business/economic perspective as the world is facing a serious oil oversupply issue and increasing production will only make it worse since a big price drop would threaten the profits and feasibility of higher cost US producers
217 2018-01-10 23:37:56 And also the Gulf Coast! (Speaking of which, how many years it took to clean up all the oil mess that was created to the Gulf's waters---& they are still cleaning that mess up today!).
218 2018-01-10 23:37:50 So why have you enacted policies that make coal, oil, and ng companies more profitable?
219 2018-01-10 23:37:48 Ang rami ng nakiki- Argan Oil 

Dara is such a trendsetter.
220 2018-01-10 23:37:35 So Fracking for OIL is ok?
221 2018-01-10 23:37:16 it emulsifies with oil super well and it’s honestly great
222 2018-01-10 23:37:03 Bell sleeves.......dangerous......pink 3 tiered bell sleeves......i refuse to drink out of anything but a wine glass.....the eleganza.......watching rick and morty , but feeling like an oil painting
223 2018-01-10 23:36:57 Hunny and sugar and mineral@oil
224 2018-01-10 23:36:56 The truest quote ever : People pray for the cake. Then someone gives them the batter, eggs, oil, icing, a pan, an oven, they get get frustrated and leave the kitchen.” Let that sink. Sometimes you have everything right in front of you, but how bad do you want it ?
225 2018-01-10 23:36:49 Pruitt is a low life a thief he works for and gets paid off by oil,chemical,and any industrial companies that what’s a favour there needs to be a full investigation into him and his bank account and in the island  bank accounts and then put in prison 
226 2018-01-10 23:36:48 wow body oil is amazing i feel like a goddess
227 2018-01-10 23:36:42 changed my mom’s oil in her honda but, the people who changed it last tightened the crap out of it. let’s say the old filter ain’t looking too well lol
228 2018-01-10 23:36:36 I am a plant powered coconut oil saturated sun filled goddess I should not have to do exams
229 2018-01-10 23:36:24 Love a cleansing oil :)
230 2018-01-10 23:36:18 Just transition to 100% renewable energy for everyone. No new coal, oil or gas projects anywhere.
231 2018-01-10 23:36:15 With the planet awash in oil there certainly isn’t any reason to drill of any of our coast.
232 2018-01-10 23:36:09 Trump to PM: “I wish we’d do some of that,” he said. “But hydropower is fantastic, and it’s a great asset that you have.” MAYBE because in the next breathe you said: “I am for massive oil and gas"....
233 2018-01-10 23:36:01 Interesting. Pitch this to a good journalist, who could make an excellent counter-narrative story to the greed of the oil industry. Who are the oil industry journalist specialists?
234 2018-01-10 23:35:55 I wonder how fast the lawsuit would be dropped if all oil companies stopped selling fuel in New York.
235 2018-01-10 23:35:47 oil
236 2018-01-10 23:35:44 @SecretaryZinke Ignorant climate change denier,thief, who thinks he can give away the people's national monuments 2 oil company pals,which he has no right to do,taxpayer $$$ wasted on travel, Puerto Rico ignored & spinelessly bowing to Drumpf to remove Florida from drilling list.
237 2018-01-10 23:35:31 Mix of oil heat and baseboard heaters (they have digital controls).   Oil tank is going to expire in a few years, probably going to get heat pump.
238 2018-01-10 23:35:13 Rick Simpson Oil 
239 2018-01-10 23:35:10 What you need is vitamin e capsules. Poke the capsule and put the oil on your lips. Cured in less than a day. You’re welcome!
240 2018-01-10 23:35:04 if you're not using coconut oil instead of lotion, what are you doing?
241 2018-01-10 23:35:02 Four hands coming together to rip off donors and produce narcissistic garbage.
242 2018-01-10 23:34:55 Realist shit I ever read: “People pray for the cake. Then God gives them the batter, eggs, oil, icing, a pan, an oven, they get get frustrated and leave the kitchen.” Let that sink. Sometimes you have everything right in front of you, but how bad do you want it ?
243 2018-01-10 23:34:47 I think the coolest thing I've ever had happen in my life was drinking a beer while a hot girl covered my body in baby oil and glitter
244 2018-01-10 23:34:45 Jaja vendan las camionetas 4x4 y compren gas oil!!
245 2018-01-10 23:34:39 Exactly! I’m pretty sure i just need a good week of rest lol I tried different skincare regimens, drinking water, praying, healing oil NADA. I’m going to the altar on Sunday because Jesus gotta fix this
246 2018-01-10 23:34:37 I love you Zubeda. As you know (because we act like it) . I can't work out how to tweet my rant. Apologies. I'm the most stone cold sober today..off the cannabis oil.. and I'm incandescent. I'm snapping at my loved ones. I've pretended my phones broke so I can't snap at any..
247 2018-01-10 23:34:34 If  crude  oil  in  BiafraLand  dries  up, all  global  conspiracy  against  us &  support  4 Jihadi  Caliphate  dries  up  too
248 2018-01-10 23:34:33 When Trump says "I'm a big oil and gas guy," he's prepping answers for his upcoming physical.
249 2018-01-10 23:34:31 Yes they do and they can be quickly fixed. And reality number 2 is that transport of oil and gas over rail is more dangerous and will too more damage to the environment. Once the lines have been in operation for a while all leaks will be found and repaired.
250 2018-01-10 23:34:22 Hi, I’m a local voice from California I DO NOT WANT  California’s coastal waters opened up to drilling or fracking for oil or gas. #LocalVoiceMatters

252 2018-01-10 23:33:55 Seen the setup at @DownUnderGeo in Perth? Big ol' tanks of baby oil
253 2018-01-10 23:33:38 @hblodget those oil rigs will look great off Nobadeer
254 2018-01-10 23:33:36 And start to punitively taxing oil and gas and the auto companies for wrecking the atmosphere, and funding the denial of climate change. Oh no half her government are oil and gas douches.
255 2018-01-10 23:33:27 Haha, knowing Norway, they'll come up with a decent retort. Funny thing is, they have oil money like it's ridiculous, but they are phasing out fossil fuel cars like mad in Norway. The oil fund surely owns a shit load of Tesla stock.
256 2018-01-10 23:33:16 @itsbl0ndie Clinique dramatically different moisturizing gel. It’s so smooth and refreshing. It’s oil free hydration and has skin strengthening ingredients. And it’s for your face or where you need moisturizing! 
257 2018-01-10 23:33:09 Obviously not the mechanism. Just the outcome.
258 2018-01-10 23:33:07 I highly recommend it. Much healthier. Easier clean up cuz of no oil. And just a lot of fun to use and experiment with. I don't think you'd be disappointed.
259 2018-01-10 23:33:03 on line at vs today two girls were discussing how they cant live in asbury because there isn’t enough charging stations for their teslas and i was just thinking of how i used a groupon to pay for an oil change this afternoon ://

263 2018-01-10 23:32:48 “People pray for the cake. Then get the batter, eggs, oil, icing, a pan, an oven, then they get frustrated and leave the kitchen.” Let that sink. Sometimes you have everything right in front of you, AND YOU DONT KNOW WHAT TO WITH IT. but in the end how bad do you want it?
264 2018-01-10 23:32:40 cc @Sharksawn @Omojuwa @ibrahim100692
265 2018-01-10 23:32:39 And I have no idea if it passes muster with olive oil aficionados. Not being one myself, this works fine for me.
266 2018-01-10 23:32:35 Now if NYC divested from and shamed Wall Street banks for financing & owning fossil fuels & oil companies, then I might take this war as something serious rather than virtue displaying.
267 2018-01-10 23:32:03 @RawStory @newsweek Is really bad news they're going to drill for oil in AK arctic wildlife refuge-smh But what is truly amazing is the penguin depicted in your article must have walked from the southern hemisphere's Galapagos or more south from Antarctica to get to Alaska #KITM
268 2018-01-10 23:31:55 ”And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.”
Revelations 6:6 (KJV)
269 2018-01-10 23:31:48 I also as a Texas resident who enjoys the texas coastline formerly request that Texas be exempt like Florida on your new drilling. I want the ecology and the beaches to stay like they are or better. No oil balls all over the beach and wildlife.
270 2018-01-10 23:31:46 Wala ang mommy at ang daddy nagpapa change oil kuh katagal nun Hindi nila kami na ihahatid at Hindi rin kami masusundo hayst
271 2018-01-10 23:31:43 Trump "No drilling for oil off the coast of Florida" Marilogo come to mind anyone, the rest the country can just go pound salt.
272 2018-01-10 23:31:35 Capacity!!! 
273 2018-01-10 23:31:35 Is he sure this has nothing to do with Mar-A-Lago and oil rigs in plain sight?? Of course it does. What a lame excuse.
274 2018-01-10 23:31:32 That time of the year when the MTA lathers subway station floors with extra virgin olive oil 
275 2018-01-10 23:31:20 yes n tea tree oil is the worst + if they digest enough can be dead within hours with absolutely no signs of being sick
276 2018-01-10 23:31:15 1) Sen. John Barrasso WY Sen. James Inhofe OK & Rep. Rob Bishop UT received hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign funds from oil & gas industries frustrated by the ESA laws & want exploit public lands for mining drilling & other environmentally destructive operations.

278 2018-01-10 23:31:06 One of the other great assets is a thing called oil.
279 2018-01-10 23:30:57 You are the oil to my water.
280 2018-01-10 23:30:54 Richie Sambora has his own oil?
281 2018-01-10 23:30:51 Just like a star across my sky,
Just like an angel off the page,
You have appeared to my life,
Feel like I'll never be the same,
Just like a song in my heart,
Just like oil on my hands,
Honour to love you
282 2018-01-10 23:30:46 Combine 11 lbs kiwi with 3 pints chips. Mix in Olive Oil. Roast. Serve over basmati rice.
283 2018-01-10 23:30:34 Trudeau is as full of shit as any politician. Pays lip service on immigration & the environment, but look at his actions w/ Canada's oil industry & immigration law. Now, he's for legalized pot but admits the tax revenue will be low & only pay for addiction issues. He's a putz.
284 2018-01-10 23:30:29 we are just going to look  after her and pamper her until she passes away, lots of treats, gonna give her some hemp oil as well ; )
285 2018-01-10 23:30:25 Agreed. But the Libs are also forcing us to buy blood oil from the Saudis, their bum-buddies, instead of from Sask/Ab. That is not efficient, and it leads to economic ruin.
286 2018-01-10 23:30:21 Like a vampire, he drinks oil out of robots.
287 2018-01-10 23:30:20 I’ll never eat at Quaker Steak & Lube. It sounds like an oil change place.

289 2018-01-10 23:30:16 NC Governor Roy Cooper is clear. No oil drilling off our shore!

291 2018-01-10 23:30:08 @EatFellowHumans cooking 911. If I don’t have butter to make a roux for gravy can I use oil ? Having pot roast and mashed taters. tia!
292 2018-01-10 23:30:03 @jeff_the420chef  Cool, thanks for the follow!  I too love the butter, my fav lately though is the organic coconut oil. 
293 2018-01-10 23:29:57 If Brent Oil Spot can get over $70 there is then a Band of Resistance up to $90.
294 2018-01-10 23:29:56 I use an old mascara wand, Clean it and you can dip it into the oil  just don’t get it in your eyes lol
295 2018-01-10 23:29:45 Sad.
296 2018-01-10 23:29:43 Some of y’all wishing to come across drugs and shit to sell. I just wish I bought some land with mineral rights and find out there’s oil in that hoe.
297 2018-01-10 23:29:37 She has sold snake oil to women to become one of the richest women in the world and for the past 20 years she turned her back on women who actually needed her...but she does a speech and all is forgiven...
298 2018-01-10 23:29:30 Why can't NC get an off shore oil drilling exemption like Florida?@NC_Governor
299 2018-01-10 23:29:25 Downtown this morning.....black smoke was inhaled by a group of us waiting to get into Park Plaza - Wondering if there were PCB's in the transformer oil that was burning and creating black smoke?  #epcor #yegdt
300 2018-01-10 23:29:17 I saw the same thing and I have one!! I have tea tree oil and lavender, some oils aren’t toxic, so I have to look up if these are or not, but my cat never had a problem, still so glad I saw it!!
301 2018-01-10 23:28:56 For ABFA (oil money) funded projects to be sustainable, the Central Government of Ghana must involve district assemblies and show real accountability. We must know how our oil money is spent.
302 2018-01-10 23:28:42 Humans are contributing with the deforestation of the forest for palm oil, oil spills, pipelines, drilling sure the list goes on
303 2018-01-10 23:28:37 Really want an oil diffuser
304 2018-01-10 23:28:35 What makes Jim think bullying and demeaning even a Conservative woman is a good idea given current climate?
305 2018-01-10 23:28:24 I felt like my skin went a bit dry since I moved from Portugal to here but nothing major,I only noticed when I used the wrong foundation  I clean my face everyday with Johnson baby oil and also when I shower it’s the last thing I apply!
306 2018-01-10 23:28:19 FTSE100 probably helped by Oil, Banks,  Miners - smaller UK indexes look like turning down though. DAX also looks to be turning.
307 2018-01-10 23:28:12 Honestly Senator it seems (from a distance) that the states are doing a better job of it anyway. It’s not like that federal dude who just oversaw the carving up of all that beautiful interior land and whoever approved more oil drilling are moving away from fossil fuels
308 2018-01-10 23:28:08 BillWeirCNN 
At least Key West will not have oil rigs on their horizon while the rest of us will need to learn how to over look them from our beaches - how do we stop this pending disaster
309 2018-01-10 23:28:08 Yep,right aling with allowing oil drilling all along east and west coast - oh yeah except for Florida where his “Southern White House” is located.
310 2018-01-10 23:28:02 And had they at least subscribed to this Twitter feed they would have/should have known to expect this weather along with nat gas shortages because of ridiculously low inventories, leading to utilities burning oil, even coal!
311 2018-01-10 23:28:00 Just realized I like the smell of this one hair Moroccan oil I use is bc it the smell remind me of one of my favorite beers grapefruit sculpin.... weird? Probs but it smells soooo good
312 2018-01-10 23:27:50 Patty, How about all the oil and gas drilling be put on hold from all the states that would be affected, not just a few.
313 2018-01-10 23:27:49 it's gotten to the point for me  where just the thought of lavender essential oil is calming to me.
314 2018-01-10 23:27:48 @erna_solberg How did it feel to be next to someone who says he wants “massive oil & gas” but then says his EPA wants “clean air & water”? This press conference was another in countless examples of how he is the most contradictory president ever. POLLUTION FOR PROFIT PRESIDENT
315 2018-01-10 23:27:43 I think I get to stay at my cousins or grandparents, but we don't get oil till the 22nd
316 2018-01-10 23:27:38 @SpecialReport So Let Me Get This Right, We Can Have Ugly Ass Windmills Off Our Eastern Cost That Kills Birds ( never mind the view ) But Not Oil Rigs @BretBaier Kinda one sided don’t ya think ?
317 2018-01-10 23:27:36 A good diet too is crucial so your body has what it needs to replenish and repair your skin. As a cleanser, I love AcneFree's Oil Free Cleanser. Generally a moisturizer for day/night time is good, and spf also for the day time use.

321 2018-01-10 23:27:29 Sad that it has come to this. Total swamp. I wonder how much money this asshole is making from oil companies
322 2018-01-10 23:27:24 Just charge oil companies $15mm per day for shore access per well.

If they spill one drop of oil it's an immediate $5bil fine and $250mm per day until clean up is completed to the states satisfaction.

324 2018-01-10 23:27:06 The price you hear on the news is a futures contract on the NYMEX (usually), deliverable in Cushing, Oklahoma. Prices paid for spot cargoes of oil elsewhere trade at different prices

326 2018-01-10 23:26:55 I have an issue with the Macaroni Salad industry: what is with the waxy sauce? Who are the adwizards who came up with this one? Can't we just get a nice mix of like oil mayo and butter? Can anyone solve this quagmire?
327 2018-01-10 23:26:46 @SecretaryZinke Ever hear of NIMBY.    That is the result of your decision to let FL off the hook ref offshore oil production.

337 2018-01-10 23:26:01 Mr. President, Thank you for working so well with congress! Thank you for working so well with Tillerson, he is the oil man. Thank you for making America great again! 
338 2018-01-10 23:26:00 Botanics rosehip oil is jamazing
339 2018-01-10 23:25:57 Well and that's why the demonization of oil companies should probably stop. They're Energy companies, not O&G companies. They're funding renewables research more than anyone. They know O&G isn't gonna be this profitable for long
340 2018-01-10 23:25:47 Most of CA's offshore related income drives from tourism, surfing, beach use, etc; all vanish in an oil accident. Why risk multiple solid long-term revenue streams for one that is short term *and* risks all the others for years to come?

Economics matter, not just environment
341 2018-01-10 23:25:46 Been sitting in my Amazon after friend a mentioned it, can't believe the pages of pages of oil painting glory!
342 2018-01-10 23:25:42 @SenatorBurr enjoy the beaches of NC with the oil rigs as a backdrop. You, Sir, need to choose country over party. Protect Mueller.  It is difficult to trust a member of GOP. $ seems to be the GOP god.
343 2018-01-10 23:25:40 @SecretaryZinke So you gave FL a break from producing oil...against Mr Trump's declaration..Do they not use oil like the rest of the country?  Now CA WA and OR will want the same treatment and Mr Trump's welcome order will lose its teeth and there will be no new exploration. Bad
344 2018-01-10 23:25:39 Well if you have ever been to the beach, regardless of what state, country, or continent, you should never see an oil rig drilling for an outdated energy supply. #allcoastsareequal

347 2018-01-10 23:25:29 Got to ask, what will suing an oil company accomplish? Besides driving up the cost of energy.
348 2018-01-10 23:25:22 @SecretaryZinke the idea of putting oil rigs off Washington's coast is completely irresponsible and imprudent. In an area known as the Ring of Fire because of earthquakes and induction zones, oil platforms are just an oil spill waiting to happen.
349 2018-01-10 23:25:05 Maybe the 5 major oil companies should stop doing business in NY.
350 2018-01-10 23:24:57 They say they come oiled but I soaked mine  in oil and rolled them and they are soft now! still thick, but soft.
351 2018-01-10 23:24:55 Why not sell the oil when you are in place for renewables?

361 2018-01-10 23:23:47 How much oil does the NYC government consume?  How much plastic?  Shouldn’t they be naming themselves in the lawsuit?  This is just beyond stupid.

364 2018-01-10 23:23:34 Agreed. And we need more research/dev into solar/wind energy. Diversify. I know of oil trades guys moving into the green infrastructure - construction & maintenance. Smart guys.

366 2018-01-10 23:23:08 You are dismissing them imo. After working in security a while you learn to use heuristics to cut through things because 99.9% of what's out there is snake oil. The experts are convinced and satisfied. You're not? Well, either trust the experts, become one, or pay them! ;)
367 2018-01-10 23:23:04 resources we take from brown nations. fruits, vegetables, metals, gems, gas, oil etc... things we use to keep our economy going. do you think those nations are 100% happy about westerners going there taking what we want?
368 2018-01-10 23:22:57 £5 says you get a bubble in the oil that just won’t budge
369 2018-01-10 23:22:57 More drastic action: cut oil exports to USA for 2 weeks.
370 2018-01-10 23:22:56 I would counter that the glut was part of that reason, but the increasing affordability and reliability of renewables MAY prevent the price of oil from rising much higher, especially in light of international divestment from fossil fuels. 1/

386 2018-01-10 23:21:25 @DrPetra There's a Rob Newman sketch about how people like Jeremy Clarkson style themselves as mavericks, saying the unsayable. But in a world which worships the car and oil, how is anything Clarkson says unsayable?
387 2018-01-10 23:21:24 There’s a perfume to help you sleep too usually chamomile or lavander. But more of oil than perfume.
388 2018-01-10 23:21:18 Most or all oil and gas extraction in California is on land. Little to none of offshore. Hard to close what isn't there!

416 2018-01-10 23:18:18 The methane source which has increased the most is fossil fuels. Mainly oil and natural gas. The rise is largely due to increasing nat gas production and a rising contribution from shale oil.
417 2018-01-10 23:18:17 The reason we had a recession  was the Saudis creating an oil glut in an attempt to destabilize Iran. The reason are recovering is the end of said oil glut.

418 2018-01-10 23:18:16 Is this in the best interest of #NYC employees & tax payers? Big Oil is providing a service to the consumers. Why don't you sue the auto industry for making gas powered cars. How much did #USTaxPayers lose with #Obama's invest in renewable energy?

426 2018-01-10 23:17:30 All coastal states depend on tourism and economy, take Maine and their fishermen & women. We Do Not need oil drilling on our coasts. I wish @realDonaldTrump ans the rest would think with their heads instead of their wallets.
427 2018-01-10 23:17:30 Fyi I swear by #rawsheabutter vitamin E oil, used high SPF suncream since age 14 (irrespective of having olive skin), drink water, use a retinol cream, eye cream at night, @BurtsBees lip balm night& day & #Smile & be a nice person #thetruthaboutlookinggood
428 2018-01-10 23:17:29 Not virtue signalling but responsible investment - lower risk than oil & gas and possible stranded assets... see @CommonsEAC green finance enquiry next Tuesday for details!
429 2018-01-10 23:17:28 Have the USA stay out of Venezuela's business then. Just because we want their OIL. Just the same old same old. The US wanting some other sovereign countries resources and looking for regime change to get it.
Denmark is actually a truer form of Socialism. Gee the happiest country
430 2018-01-10 23:17:23 Oh my god Vo5 hot oil is a godsend that transcends the decades.
431 2018-01-10 23:17:22 I’d Florida, or other states, want an  exemption from producing off-shore oil energy for the nation, they should pay an extra off-setting fuel tax to be exempted.  A free pass is not justified.  All for one, one for all.
432 2018-01-10 23:17:14 He was supposed impose more Sanctions, Russia is supplying N Korea with oil. We need to protect ourselves, keeping our Allies is Critical especially when everything is in such turmoil.
433 2018-01-10 23:17:11 I usually put on facial oil before I use it cause yes it’s super drying
434 2018-01-10 23:17:03 If anyone from the UK was wondering about the cbd oil and ordering send me a message :D
435 2018-01-10 23:16:59 This is better than living under the biggest oil well
436 2018-01-10 23:16:54 @StarbucksCanada why is there oil residue in my white chocolate mocha? # Starbucks # gross #whitechocolatemocha
437 2018-01-10 23:16:51 In this case no oil for NY
438 2018-01-10 23:16:48 Is Florida's offshore drilling "off the table" because DT has a little cottage there? Guess he doesn't want Mar-a-Lago's waters sullied by oil spills...as for other states, well........
439 2018-01-10 23:16:36 3 sleeps for us. GO OIL!!!
440 2018-01-10 23:16:35 I am no fan of the oil companies. Lol, he said Rome fell due to Keynesianism? LOL! They fell because they became cucks and let the mongrels in.
441 2018-01-10 23:16:33 yaaasss girl when i tell you my skin is clearing the fuck up  i heard castor oil and coconut oil helps too tho
442 2018-01-10 23:16:27 Notice what Zinke is doing, look at markets today. What is Putin involved in. As well Trump and sure many other in his circle. OIL, OIL, OIL
443 2018-01-10 23:16:26 Unlikely she was talking about her personal investments and much more likely that she was talking about the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund created from oil revenues to benefit the general population.
444 2018-01-10 23:16:23 Oil dominance is ridiculous! Stay away from our water, @SecretaryZinke We hate you here in Washington state.
445 2018-01-10 23:16:10 ... and why does Florida being unique help them? Are you saying that the oil folks are going to spill and that might hurt Florida's tourism? #ass #TeddyURnot #worstkindofpolitician #loser #trump
446 2018-01-10 23:16:03 This literally reminds me of when i had ms. Manuel for nutrition and wellness and she made us make eggs like 10 different ways and this idiot in my group decided to fry an egg with a pan full of oil
447 2018-01-10 23:16:02 I've used the geographic allocation method (so nearer 80% to Scotland under "normal" circumstances) - but of course per GERS,  oil revenues were no more than a rounding error by 2015/16 anyway - oh and see footnotes: I compare with GERS and GERW & pretty close
448 2018-01-10 23:15:42 It’s 5:09, I’m at my desk working and I get asked if I’m burning the midnight oil tonight #governmentjob
449 2018-01-10 23:15:42 Repaired 1929 door or at least one side. Gripper primer and Behr oil paint hiding a multitude of things I failed to fix.
450 2018-01-10 23:15:37 Not to mention the cynical deviousness that the oil majors' shareholders wil have to bear theur legal costs, while it's NYC taxpayers who'll have to bear City Hall's
Hope NYC lose & then residents pursue class action against de Blasio personally & bankrupt him
451 2018-01-10 23:15:26 Zombie anti-vaccine tropes are always amusing. About once or twice a year, peanut oil shows up somewhere about vaccines.
452 2018-01-10 23:15:21 I find it incredible and damn rite amusing all the rags think they have on us is empty seats and oil money. That’s only means one thing, they are hurting very deep inside seeing what’s going on across the city to them. 
453 2018-01-10 23:15:20 .@NatResources today moved to gut protections for marine mammals endangered by seismic airgun blasting. Yet again, placing oil special interests before our environment and the needs of coastal communities who rely on tourism. HR 3133 must never become law.
454 2018-01-10 23:15:13 Make your own! I don’t trust any chemicals lmao, honey, any kind of sugar and any oil, vitamin e or coconut or almond oils
455 2018-01-10 23:15:11 oil industry should refuse to deliver fuel within the state.that would shut this horseshit down
456 2018-01-10 23:15:09 I hope they’d spread em then point to their robo pussy and make the noise that the Tin man did in wizard of Oz when he needed oil
457 2018-01-10 23:15:09 Step1:  Disable all smoke alarms
Step 2:  Burn oil to pan
Step 3:  ???
Step 4:  PROFIT!!!
458 2018-01-10 23:14:51 I wouldn't dare try that snake oil.
459 2018-01-10 23:14:37 Well if we all did it, would bankrupt oil companies and we go back to horse and carts until they release free energy technology.
460 2018-01-10 23:14:32 . @VoteJan Wow, look how . @FLGovScott was able to stop the offshore drilling for oil off of FL. He will make a great Senator for FL!
461 2018-01-10 23:14:32 I’d like to cook things with imaginative & delicious names like Roasted Beet & Grilled Flat Bread with a lightly scented garlic dipping oil.  

My usual meal of hot dogs with mustard would run off in horror.
462 2018-01-10 23:14:29 Venezuela isn't about socialism. It is about the USA wanting their Oil and imposing sanctions looking for Regime change. Look to other socialist countries such as Denmark where they have no resources the US wants.
463 2018-01-10 23:14:29 So, it’s oil’ s contract that justifies an hostile attitude from France toward the people of the DRC by blocking an EU resolution to condemn the mediocrity of kabilie 31/1/2017. France should know that 1 elected Gov in Congo Can/ will rescind dis contract
464 2018-01-10 23:14:05 In 07 when oil was at $150 and  soybean & corn were at $16 and $7 respectively they said inflation numbers were ex food and energy.
465 2018-01-10 23:14:00 No, Mike Adams knows his audience. The people dim-witted enough to believe in chemtrails are his target market. Mike's not the dumb one, the people buying his snake oil are.
466 2018-01-10 23:13:57 man can tapper show he is more mental every day, he oppose all oil drilling if fla dont want drilling off there shores thats up 2 them its money they will lose tapper most liberal media show america they r really the ones who have mental problems they r fake there news is fake
467 2018-01-10 23:13:54 Did you ask her how her country has a $1 trillion  SURPLUS of cash in their treasury. No national debt. Oil royalties invested for the people. @realDonaldTrump
468 2018-01-10 23:13:44 My grocery list, so far:

Olive oil
Garlic
Broccoli

Am I forgetting anything else?

473 2018-01-10 23:13:06 We do. But on the other hand we're filthy rich from oil and gas production, with most of the revenues invested in a $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund.
474 2018-01-10 23:13:03 شكراً ي غناتي
475 2018-01-10 23:12:56 Local voice, here, Secretary Zinke… We would like Washington state taken off the table for offshore oil any gas as well. I think there's quite a few local voices that join me.
476 2018-01-10 23:12:52 i was only looking for a human to reciprocate.

478 2018-01-10 23:12:40 Artic Oil and Mineral exploration is  very important  thank you  for doing this for  Canada .
479 2018-01-10 23:12:35 ... has it's own risks which are unique to that particular state. For example, the coast if Mass. was just raked by a winter storm that flooded coastal counties freezing cars into blocks if ice on the street. An oil spill there would be just as devastating as in Florida. (2)
480 2018-01-10 23:12:32 Cause they can’t get their ratings up.
481 2018-01-10 23:12:21 Why would you wash anyone's feet with your hair? Especially feet caked with dirt and probably also blood? Did she oil her hair? What are you doing, Mary?
482 2018-01-10 23:12:21 well, maybe the mexicalis will pay for the new water mains. Or Florida since there won’t be any funds spent on cleaning the Gulf of Mexico of oil drill spills 
483 2018-01-10 23:12:13 I think he said exactly what he meant.  He wants to use the amount of hydro that Norway uses and instead burn coal and oil.

487 2018-01-10 23:11:50 And English olive oil?
488 2018-01-10 23:11:48 #CAbudget Why worry about the budget...?  The ocean will be polluted from oil drilling, the land is being destroyed from overdevelopment and in the not too distant future we'll probably be saluting the Chinese flag.
RIP California...  you used to be heaven on Earth. #splitkooks
489 2018-01-10 23:11:38 Been said "never 2nd chance to make 1st impression." Really unhappy with 1st: Towed vehicle in; asked 4 look-see. Battery dead&bad belt. Asked check battery. Put in new didn't check old. New belt, new pulley, change oil. Excess $1100. Over week to even start. Not good experience
490 2018-01-10 23:11:31 At best, Oprah is a snake oil salesperson. Dr. Oz? Dr. Phil? Seriously? Could this shit be an more devoid of substance? She sells hope and pseudo-science. Snake oil. Bread and circuses as the Romans called it.
491 2018-01-10 23:11:27 They're great! You can also buy this powder that will solidify a lot of frying oil so you can glorp it out
492 2018-01-10 23:11:27 NYC is suing the oil companies.
493 2018-01-10 23:11:22 Then maybe, just maybe ALL Oil and Nat Gas should be shut off to NYC. Then watch as hilarity ensues.
494 2018-01-10 23:11:20 At least it's not Argentina... All that oil and no money...
495 2018-01-10 23:11:14 The newest trend in skincare: unicorn horn-infused hair oil
496 2018-01-10 23:11:13 Pot, kettle, Black.....and talking of lies..... Vote No to safeguard Banking/Pensions/Shipbùilding/Staying in EU ....I could go on but you really don't seem to comprehend the difference betwèen error and lies...oh, and that reminds me... Scotland's oil is running out......
497 2018-01-10 23:10:59 COCONUT OIL
498 2018-01-10 23:10:53 We use hardly any of the oil we produce.
499 2018-01-10 23:10:52 We will see more cities do this sue oil companies stuff.
500 2018-01-10 23:10:46 Especially while calling for oil drilling everywhere

504 2018-01-10 23:10:26 Give that thing some new oil once in a while
505 2018-01-10 23:10:16 I notice you said oil spill and not leaks .Well if anyone knows anything about "LEAKS" it's you sneaky Diane
506 2018-01-10 23:10:09 Same. I was *this* close to snorting eucalyptus essential oil last night
507 2018-01-10 23:10:06 Sold out of all Canadian #oil today that I still held.  Just think the run has been great since mid Dec and I will wait for the rebuy. Still like several mlps that are simply not pricing in the YOY difference like $SPH $SRLP and $CEQP (long all those).
508 2018-01-10 23:10:02 Is that Before or After the Oil Spill Destroys the Pristine Beaches?!
509 2018-01-10 23:09:52 Interesting little experiment on #TrustMeImADoctor Coconut oil reduced LDL (bad cholesterol) & increased HDL cholesterol (good),. Butter raised LDL. 

Plant-based saturated fat wins! 
510 2018-01-10 23:09:40 Yes! Everyone thinks oil is so bad for your face but it’s actually exactly what you need! (As long as you don’t already have naturally oily skin) but i use this vitamin E oil that is FANTASTIC and doesn’t leave an oily feeling afterwards!!
511 2018-01-10 23:09:36 They'll use the oil on you soon
512 2018-01-10 23:09:25 mobil saya jaman dulu, yg nyala tuh lampu oil sama charge nya doang. terus kedip2 ngikutin irama radio, alay ga?
513 2018-01-10 23:09:10 @jimcramer EVs scared global oil producers to get off their peak oil asses.  Thank green energy for the short term petro recovery
514 2018-01-10 23:09:05 I just looked at the days of supply. Crude, gasoline and distillate are at or below 5 year average line. Heating oil is dangerously low and we are not done with winter. Every single product is lower than 5 year average-even propane.
515 2018-01-10 23:08:50 Y’all be copping the 1000mg thc oil cartridges or just the 500mg joints?

521 2018-01-10 23:08:18 to everyone who asks about my hair: i used john frieda volume shampoo, soak cheap conditioner in my hair for five minutes and oil all twice each week. I brush my hair straight then try n tussle it!
522 2018-01-10 23:08:00 Maybe you should get the dotard to built a Mar a lago West. He doesn't want to see oil rigs from his golf course.
523 2018-01-10 23:07:58 I grew up in New Jersey, and spent just about 30 or 40 Summers at our cottage in Lavalette, NJ on the Jersey Shore.  No freaking way do Jersey folks want leaky, Trump-deregulated oil rigs sitting off those beautiful beaches! #JerseyShore #JerseyStrong
524 2018-01-10 23:07:36 Matilda smells like cocoa and we have been giving her coconut oil so she is super soft and most mornings I just can't cope with getting up.
525 2018-01-10 23:07:26 Hm. Why don't you explain to the rest of the GOP exactly how drilling for oil isn't good for the environment?

529 2018-01-10 23:07:06 have you tried using bio oil to reduce the scarring?
530 2018-01-10 23:07:03 You've got to be kidding.
531 2018-01-10 23:07:02 @jimcramer are inflation expectations too low given the rise in oil, housing, financial assets, etc over the last 2 years?
532 2018-01-10 23:06:48 Stop using palm oil please
533 2018-01-10 23:06:47 Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me. You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; you anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.

544 2018-01-10 23:04:44 Poor coal gurus made poor oil gurus. Poor oil gurus will make poor future energy gurus. Once a guru, always a guru. That's why they are leading. The energy mix will be neessary for a very long time.
545 2018-01-10 23:04:42 Also, Trump owns ocean front property in Florida (Mar-a-Lago) and his administration exempted Florida from offshore oil and gas drilling.
546 2018-01-10 23:04:40 Each day we are sharing a reason why Governor Inslee should deny the proposal to build the nation's largest oil terminal in Vancouver.
Reason 2: In 2013, 25 train cars carrying crude oil derailed in rural Alabama. No injuries were reported, crude oil spilled into a marshland.

554 2018-01-10 23:03:44 Creating plastic burns a lot of oil. Oil companies are insidious, mixing their chemicals into nearly all waste, and air, land & water.

562 2018-01-10 23:02:37 Blair is a war  criminal, a complicit with Bush in the 9/11 conspiracy and subsequent rush for oil in Iraq. Think of all the lives lost!
563 2018-01-10 23:02:31 The good part for me was between not dying and being found naked and covered in baby oil and eating a tasty scotch egg
564 2018-01-10 23:02:21 I bet all those pre-historic creatures were proud to die then spend millions of years underground fermenting into crude oil so that I could drive my Corsa to B&M Bargains.
565 2018-01-10 23:02:17 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.
566 2018-01-10 23:02:15 Being a woman in public is exhausting, I just wanted a f&*%ing oil change edition.
567 2018-01-10 23:02:06 Thank fuck for overtime and holiday pay. My car is costing me $600. Granted, it could have been much worse with the wipeout last week. Oil change, inspection, something with the front sway bar, and then new brake pads and rotors. But it’s all getting done.
568 2018-01-10 23:02:03 Coconut oil and coffee... So cheap and so good from everything I've heard! I'm trying it when I get back to school

570 2018-01-10 23:02:01 @gabeflowers Evening Primrose Oil can help induction
571 2018-01-10 23:01:52 TAEP's @JJT13 was excited to discuss ways in which #State and #Federal #policy can work together on #oil and #natgas issues with @EPA Region 6 Administrator Anne Idsal and the Domestic Energy Producers Alliance.
572 2018-01-10 23:01:48 so moisturising feels like extra oil and it’s yucky
573 2018-01-10 23:01:36 Maybe if the oil rigs weren’t forced to be in water 5 miles deep, any repairs or damage would be quicker and easier to do. Idiot....
574 2018-01-10 23:01:33 Just what is a fairer deal? More Smog? More Coal and Oil.
575 2018-01-10 23:01:33 Y’all know Gotti verse on “Wet” with Chris Brown?! 

I thought he said,”I get the oil first and then anoint you.”

578 2018-01-10 23:01:21 Put oil rigs off the coast of Georgia, @GaRepublicans and @GovernorDeal don't give one shit!!
579 2018-01-10 23:01:21 The only thing olive oil and I got in common is that we're both extra virgin
580 2018-01-10 23:01:20 Florida supposedly got out of offshore oil expansion thanks to pushback from the (R) governor. 

Let's see if a state without a garish presidential tv-watching and golfing enclave gets the same deferment.
581 2018-01-10 23:01:17 Trump supporters are very rare here in MA also. Liz Warren claims to represent me but I don’t see it.
582 2018-01-10 23:01:04 The west coast of Florida will not be spared (remember BP Gulf oil spill,) they are truly only sparing the east coast, to please Trump. But I feel compelled to state that I see any spared coastline as a good, even if for evil reasons, some creatures and coastline might survive.
583 2018-01-10 23:01:04 Coconut oil pulling be nasty but it works really well

585 2018-01-10 23:00:51 Heat oil in a pan. Mustard. Green beans. Let them cook for a while. Eat with rice.
586 2018-01-10 23:00:32 It looks like we are alone and forgotten in the whole world, it looks like nobody care but our oil and natural resources, we are knees down by Maduro's boot
587 2018-01-10 23:00:16 Burning the midnight oil reading about linguistic structuralism because I am a cool guy.
588 2018-01-10 23:00:12 Trump couldn't lift the sanctions on Russia so tillison and his boys can drill over there in Russia so now they want to drill for oil All Over America bullcrap
589 2018-01-10 23:00:10 Heat oil in a pan, throw mustard and garlic, throw chopped onion, add salt,fry a bit, throw chopped veggie (tomato or capsicum), add Maggie masala or anything you have at home, chilli powder. Eat with rice..
590 2018-01-10 23:00:09 can we just take a moment to appreciate how i told diego *ONCE* that i wanted to start using oil paints instead of acrylic and he gets me paint, canvases, and some new knives??
591 2018-01-10 23:00:03 Omg no. Oregano oil is so gross
592 2018-01-10 23:00:00 #OTD in AR history, Oil is discovered in El Dorado for the first time in 1910.
593 2018-01-10 22:59:53 Like BP getting an award for their oil spill cleanup.
594 2018-01-10 22:59:49 Girl thought I was gone have to get my holy oil out 
595 2018-01-10 22:59:33 i miss the days when we were trying to get away from oil
596 2018-01-10 22:59:17 I missed the conversation, but I know coconut oil also has a million great uses!  Love ya Bethenny; I am an enormous fan, and you are 100% an inspiration for all man-kind!!! 
597 2018-01-10 22:59:15 I’m excited. I told them I was never going back and he asked if I would if I got free oil changes. Hell yeah!
598 2018-01-10 22:59:02 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.
599 2018-01-10 22:58:55 What’s happened to @AlanDersh? How has he fallen so low this late in his career? He’s been acting like a high priced ambulance chaser for months & now sells his soul to snake oil conglomerate @21CF & its principal @realDonaldTrump? Why not save his dignity & ride into the sunset?
600 2018-01-10 22:58:54 Are you talking about Ryan and Scott ...who are going about digging, drilling , destroying the environment for $$$ from big oil and the coal you have washed clean ! Or Betsy ..cant find the words
601 2018-01-10 22:58:52 What a great day for Change.  Today I will change my mindset about rain. Today I see rain as a friend that cleans the dirt and smells away. I love you rain and you also provide us with water to drink and give life to our essential oil plant and tree items. DoTerra essential oils
602 2018-01-10 22:58:48 Fractionated Coconut Oil in my bath...on my feet...and in my diffuser tonight!  I need to breath!
603 2018-01-10 22:58:30 We were oil and water laying side by side 
604 2018-01-10 22:58:28 Any cream or lotion you have mixed with olive oil is very good to moisturize your skin (and sorry for my bad English?

607 2018-01-10 22:58:12 Everybody deserves protection from the oil lobby!
608 2018-01-10 22:58:09 Let’s hope NYC will be fair and sue all those who used the oil in question
609 2018-01-10 22:58:08 You just answered your own question, facilities we need. Once we build them we can lower spending costs. We need to catch up. You know what really scares me with cons? You never consider that the reason our economy was so dependent on oil and gas for so long
610 2018-01-10 22:57:52 Tip for the ladies: dowse yourself in gasoline and the smell will attract rich oil barons who might bed and or wed you
611 2018-01-10 22:57:49 California is BROKE as usual...expects the rest of America to pay for their wacky liberal projects, but turns it's back on oil industry jobs, and income.
NEVER changes.

Let em go bankrupt.

614 2018-01-10 22:57:29 Actual energy independence focused on growth and what will work for the long term health, wealth, and well being of #SouthCarolina would not involve oil.
615 2018-01-10 22:57:21 Norway protected its resources prior to drilling for oil in the North Sea in the 1960. London lifted up the Scottish kilt so that outside oil giants, including BP, could come in and rape and pillage your resources. Norway today owns about 1.5% of all listed companies worldwide.
616 2018-01-10 22:57:19 Oil and gas are being disrupted, though. Meat consumption just looks likely to rise for half a century or more.
617 2018-01-10 22:57:18 You know what they say about the blind squirrel...
618 2018-01-10 22:57:16 Werent you the one who knocked the oil drain plug out of the transmission after hitting a curb at 70 mph
619 2018-01-10 22:56:55 Got me some vicks vapor rub with lavender oil. 
620 2018-01-10 22:56:50 Every time I get my oil changed I find out more and more of what’s wrong w my car I don’t like being made aware of these things
621 2018-01-10 22:56:34 Lorne || Oil and Water
622 2018-01-10 22:56:18 We would literally all die and/or live miserable lives without oil and fossil fuels. If wind and solar energy industry disappeared tomorrow nobody in the world would notice.
623 2018-01-10 22:56:18 Aveeno moisturiser & shower oil with oatmeal are insanely good.
624 2018-01-10 22:56:00 Think of it in full! Basically, the "cloud of forgetting" is used to fund the transitional oil supplies were delivered late. Oh hell yes. .
625 2018-01-10 22:55:59 Amazing, incredible.....reminds me of a drop of petrol/oil in water and the patterns it makes
626 2018-01-10 22:55:56 I love putting coconut oil all over my body
627 2018-01-10 22:55:52 Would honestly do anything for them nice olbas oil tissues and headache tablets
628 2018-01-10 22:55:43 who wants to change my oil w me before this snow comes 
629 2018-01-10 22:55:30 Eating fat food to lose weight. Consuming foods with MUFA’s (molyunsaturated) and PUFA’s (polyunsaturated) accommodates the calories needed. 

Eating salmon, avocados, olive oil, dark chocolate, chia seeds, flax oil in mod’ helps. Get your fats.
630 2018-01-10 22:55:29 Pour sundried tomato oil directly down my throat
631 2018-01-10 22:55:12 We are producing plenty of fossil fuels, we need to open more opportunities in alternative fuels; these are the greatest areas of job growth over the past decade.  Nonetheless, this is just a republican play to give back to Big oil donors and it’s so transparent it’s nauseating.
632 2018-01-10 22:55:08 I could eat red oil wontons everyday. #heartburn4life
633 2018-01-10 22:54:51 He feels so strongly about the environment that he is allowing oil drilling next to the shores of Ca. & NJ. Not Florida though( that's where Mara-a-Lago is!) .
634 2018-01-10 22:54:49 What are they running on now?  Oil still?
635 2018-01-10 22:54:47 Lame bullshit . every single man made thing is made from oil ...post industrial revolution , its possible the carbon that makes your body is made from oil ...i bet he'll still get in his planes , eat his fancy food, love his coal provided heat . Anyone who thinks this is great is
636 2018-01-10 22:54:31 Jones is a classic cynical huckster. He had a radio show in Austin back in the day, he played up conspiracies, & little by little his act has morphed into this. He even admitted in court that his persona is an act. His website is designed to sell verility supplements & snake oil
637 2018-01-10 22:54:29 Why?  Because #Ecuador took a $9B #oil deal from @ChinaDailyUSA, after the  USA wouldn't pay pennies on the dollar to #KeepItInTheGround and deadbeat oil megacompany @PromoTexacoDO @Chevron, reneged on their responsibility to pay $6B for their awful #oilpollution!!  @AmazonWatch
638 2018-01-10 22:54:24 Love this tokens, add oil!!!
639 2018-01-10 22:54:22 I wonder what happens when you put poppers in an oil diffuser?  There's only one way to find out!
640 2018-01-10 22:54:22 Just got asked to go get a beer while waiting to get my oil changed by a guy wearing a sweatshirt that says "assholes live forever" #victory
641 2018-01-10 22:54:17 Paris could have pushed industry to be innovative. To open us up to alternative energy sources which in turn creates new jobs and helps the enviorment. Oil, coal, and natural gas will eventually be gone and we as a nation will be behind the 8-ball. #ThinkOfTheFuture
642 2018-01-10 22:54:17 No, no it won’t. It’ll just put a veil over everyone’s eyes as the US keeps bombing the Middle East, supplies Saudi Arabia, lets big pharma and oil run this country, lets banks grow bigger and allows companies to outsource and abuse labor

644 2018-01-10 22:54:04 Yesterday was a hard day and in a state of distraction I put a large amount of what appeared to be simple syrup in my coffee only to find out it was olive oil. Embarrassed I drank it anyway and I’m happy to report that it wasn’t terrible.

651 2018-01-10 22:53:36 Issa’s joke about fellow Republicans Rohrabacher & King being on Putin’s payroll was an indicator. 4 the benefit of creep Glenn Greenwald, they’re not Russian spy’s nor were Ron Paul, PatBuchanan, Giuliani, Peters, Franklin Graham in saluting Putin & his oil yrs ago over Obama.
652 2018-01-10 22:53:36 Of course the ONE day I cook shirtless oil jumps and hits me in the stomach

658 2018-01-10 22:52:56 Entirely possible?? It’s entirely possible that the earth revolves around the sun. It’s fucking for CERTAIN that trump exempted his own properties from the possibility of oil spill disasters.
659 2018-01-10 22:52:41 Can someone tell me how the hell I lost a jumbo bottle of tea tree oil before I even opened it jxjrjeosnd idek if it's in MD or here in CA omfg I'm so FRUSTRATED
660 2018-01-10 22:52:40 Sitting here sniffing a tissue with olbas oil on it what’s good 
661 2018-01-10 22:52:07 5) Government's energy dominance plan as released doesn't really align with the optimal profit of the refineries. Especially, at an open market like the US, it is hard to dictate to corporations to use domestic oil when there are cheaper options to replace it.

669 2018-01-10 22:50:53 Trump's continuation of his agenda allowing unbridled exploitation of natural resources while deregulating enviromental protection laws. And the US doesn't need the oil. Unfathomable unchecked greed to feed the kleptocracy.
670 2018-01-10 22:50:52 Did they forget about the other oil companies??? Trafi statoil etc
671 2018-01-10 22:50:45 I was surprised to hear Trump say he cares about the environment today, esp water!. Why then does he let coal companies dump crap into streams ? And now allow oil rigs to be created off any shore? They eventually leak into ocean. Was he just trying to impress PM of Norway?
672 2018-01-10 22:50:39 If you've got coconut oil and brown sugar. Mix that shit together and rub it on your face. It should smooth your skin. I do it everyday xx
673 2018-01-10 22:50:34 We have a Tesla charging station here in my little Louisiana town, but I never see any cars using it. Probably because SWLA is oil country.

If @elonmusk would just give me a car, I’d drive it every day to set a good example for the rest of the state.

I WOULD FALL ON THAT SWORD.
674 2018-01-10 22:50:31 If this wasn’t so serious I would laugh. This uneducated,science denying, lying, big oil loving pos has no decency

680 2018-01-10 22:50:15 I think all the oil companies should come to an agreement to close every gas station in New York and see how that plays out
681 2018-01-10 22:50:03 I think we should just extract all the oil from your greasy hair and save the coasts!
682 2018-01-10 22:49:55 NYC Mayor de Blasio is suing the 5 big oil companies for causing global warming and causing Hurricane Sandy.
What a huckster!

684 2018-01-10 22:49:29 The constituents desire the @realDonaldTrump agenda that is bringing our country back from the brink Obama brought us to during the 8 loooong disastrous torturous years. Look at the market, look at economic growth, look at the jobs, look at the growth of mining and oil drilling!!
685 2018-01-10 22:49:15 Renewable Energy! It’s over for oil & gas.. Just look to China where IVANKA owns her SWEAT SHOPS! Even they use SOLAR..
686 2018-01-10 22:49:05 1.10.1901 - Oil was discovered at the Spindletop oil field near Beaumont, TX.

Stepping back, Viola went to pour a teaspoon worth of the coconut oil into the palm of her hand. She began warming it in between her hands by rubbing them together before moving to apply the oil to his back.

Her hands—
691 2018-01-10 22:48:54 I started doing this thing called “oil pulling” with coconut oil to detox my body and holy fucking shit, I feel horrible. I’m definitely getting detoxed.
692 2018-01-10 22:48:54 The sell off started in July 2014. Then oil price fell & delayed the return. Then the Fed raised rates & $800b left emerging markets
693 2018-01-10 22:48:52 Hope the oil companies can sue back for frivolous court costs.

You cut taxes for the 1% so the 99% now pay for 1% Tax Cut
704 2018-01-10 22:47:20 But...But...But...it's the green future. I'm sure the alarmists have lot's of oil, gas, heat....
705 2018-01-10 22:47:09 the package had x2 spicey!!! and a chicken on it and i added like the last of my hot sesame oil to the broth
706 2018-01-10 22:47:08 While you are at it, take all the other states off your draft offshore plan. Oil spills HAPPEN! All of our shores are at equal risk. Florida is no more important or special than any other.
707 2018-01-10 22:46:55 Every state objecting to drilling relies heavily on tourism and has a natural desire to protect their coastline and marine wildlife from oil leaks.
708 2018-01-10 22:46:50 mom of the year award goes to the lady walking her kid around Hollywood Studios as she casually rips her oil pen. #goals
709 2018-01-10 22:46:46 Snarking aside, the huge amount of easily available hydropower is a really really big plus to Norwegian economy. Allows them to export their oil, too.

Sure, US produces twice in raw GWhs, but US hydro share is ~16%, whereas Norway has ~95%. And they export surplus power for €.
710 2018-01-10 22:46:43 oil drillers
711 2018-01-10 22:46:40 New England has been compounding heating oil challenge by burning oil to produce up to 40% of electricity used during cold waves. 
Gas utilities purchase fuel with delivery commitments. Opportunistic power generators depend on short term interruptible delivery.
712 2018-01-10 22:46:40 Every time I take my car to get a oil change, they always say something broke or need to be replaced 
713 2018-01-10 22:46:37 Senator: what is your plan to lower our dependence on foreign oil?   Please remember that Theodore Roosevelt once said “complaining about something without offering any solution is called whining”. I suspect that is what you are doing here.  It is however expected from you.
714 2018-01-10 22:46:19 I see my favorite-multi colored carrots. I roast them with olive oil, garlic, thyme and of course s&p  :-)
715 2018-01-10 22:46:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, but reform our laws to make your life better.

717 2018-01-10 22:46:03 As if my today my bed broke, the cupboard hinge broke and a bottle of oil was spilt over the kitchen floor! Everything is a disaster in our house this week
718 2018-01-10 22:45:58 Looking for face oil recommendations for oily skin ?! #skincare 
719 2018-01-10 22:45:57 Maybe. I’d seen someone use it (maybe you?), as well as an esthetician I follow & I’d seen it at trade shows.  it’s like the only one I hadn’t tried. & boom.

Exfoliation gloves. Glytone body wash Currently testing the best oils & lotions for this area but Rosehip oil  works well
720 2018-01-10 22:45:51 Earl grey is black tea infused with oil of bergamot, which is a kind of citrus. I've never drunk it before so I can't recommend it or un-recommend it, one way or another.
721 2018-01-10 22:45:41 So happy that NYC has chosen to #Divest and take action against oil companies!
722 2018-01-10 22:45:39 محسن بن تركي
723 2018-01-10 22:45:37 Wow, all we need now is a few oil rigs off of Santa Monica.
724 2018-01-10 22:45:36 Lo curioso es que su mujer ya le fue

725 2018-01-10 22:45:36 I rub her down in oil
726 2018-01-10 22:45:36 I HADN'T DISCOVERED ARGAN OIL YET. THOSE WERE TERRIBLE TIMES.
727 2018-01-10 22:45:35 Lmao samesame. Coconut oil overnight leaves my hair so smooth worth trying
728 2018-01-10 22:45:08 @MTP A FOREIGN ENTITY VIRTU PARTNERS "hacked" the computer trading systems at the CCM causing the precipitous rise in commodity prices "we the people" deal with daily in gas/heating oil. Can they also "hack" voting machines?
729 2018-01-10 22:44:47 Hey, all Gov Scott had to say was Mr Trump you will be seeing oil rigs from Mar A Lago  no suprise
730 2018-01-10 22:44:31 The U.S. bottled water industry consumes roughly 50 MILLION barrels of oil per year, enough oil to fuel 3 MILLION cars for one year.
731 2018-01-10 22:44:27 The best way to defeat Big Oil is to cut the puppet strings they use to control Congress. #28thAmendment campaign finance reform will clear the path for true change to happen. @WolfPAChq @StampStampede @IssueOneReform @usapromise @RepresentDotUs will make it happen.
732 2018-01-10 22:44:25 He said: don’t we have to include facts in the story even if they undermine our political agenda & propaganda efforts? Oh wait. No, they’re all 100% fine with selective reporting of only the facts that fit. They let you do that when you’re a star reporter.
733 2018-01-10 22:44:13 In today's episode of #Asthewhitehouseturns  ...our Stomachs

"Hey Zinke, an oil rig within view of MaraLago isn't good 4 my brand" 

"Easy! I'll exempt Florida"

"Well, just make it look good u know? Don't make it seem like I asked"

#DrillingisKilling
734 2018-01-10 22:44:08 He then realised that he had come face to face with the scrambled egg monster. It gave a low growl, sounding like the sizzle of oil. The rogue remembered that he had a secret weapon in his bag of holding!

@bioha7ard
735 2018-01-10 22:43:44 @BobVanVoris Re NYC suing big oil what a waste of $, court time etc. Maybe big oil companies should stop selling oil in NYC and make the point of Stupidity; and tell the citizens they're on own till the foolish litigation stops!
736 2018-01-10 22:43:42 This shine oil for my hair smells like strawberry
My hair now officially smells like strawberry
Can I nibble on my own hair yet
737 2018-01-10 22:43:41 FACT: Manufacturing the nearly 28 billion plastic bottles used each year to package water in the United States alone requires the equivalent of 17 MILLION barrels of oil.
738 2018-01-10 22:43:40 that isn't the right answer. do you want me to sigh like a 16 year old and talk about how I want to be a lawyer and wear braces and have terrible hair because I had not yet discovered argan oil?
739 2018-01-10 22:43:32 I won't criticize Oprah as a voice for women or the black community but it's super important to remember that A) she is the mental health equivalent of a snake oil salesman with her doctor oz/phil shit and b)
She came on at the same time as ninja turtles and can never be forgiven
740 2018-01-10 22:43:28 Girl me too! It’s horrible! I would def recommend the Sephora airbrush foundation! I think Fenty is pretty good too but I use a setting powder after that it. Do you prime your face? I use the smash box oil control primer and it helps me out A LOT!
741 2018-01-10 22:43:24 #Oilers tanking but great to watch McDavid nice goal last night #Edmonton #NHL will the oil spend the money for defense?
742 2018-01-10 22:43:19 I believe climate change is real,  but suing and divesting ? What a joke. You know how you divest ? By not USING the stuff . You will continue to use the oil while you sue . Its nothing but window dressing .
743 2018-01-10 22:43:02 My husband worked in oil. It doesn't pay very well when gas is <$3/gallon.

746 2018-01-10 22:42:39 2) The oil import from Canada keeps increasing while imports from OPEC countries keep decreasing. Refinery complexity isn't the issue. Actually, US refineries are much complex than the other refiners around the world. That lets them handle heavier oil and increase their margins.
747 2018-01-10 22:42:31 when they say the oil change gonna be 15 minutes so you leave your school stuff + laptop in the car but it's been almost 3 hours :')
748 2018-01-10 22:42:31 Wow just found out oil diffuser is toxic to cats so I've been slowly killing my cat 
749 2018-01-10 22:42:22 Congressman Schiff do you not have offshore oil and gas in your state? I think I have seen them when I was stationed in CA? Then we need to stop all offshore drilling. Sound good eh?
750 2018-01-10 22:42:07 A mixture of tea tree oil, witch hazel and aloe vera is the absolute best. Works like a charm
751 2018-01-10 22:41:53 Sue China, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Libya, Syria, Russia and every other country that drills for oil. Sue China twice for all of their emissions. Then sue yourself for being a Buffoon.  What a waste of time. #Nonsense #SmokeAndMirrors
752 2018-01-10 22:41:50 One big problem with Republican policy is that they never consider “then what?”  Legalize silencers, drill oil offshore and cut the clean up reserve fund, remove sanctions on dirty banks, run up the debt, ignore Puerto Rico, undermine health care, and on and on...
753 2018-01-10 22:41:48 Not to mention, Trump has his property & golf course that we’d all like to see him permanently retire to this year, and doesn’t want it to ruin with a nasty oil spill.. 
Any other questions?
754 2018-01-10 22:41:42 And If you do try this make sure it’s sweet almond oil. 
755 2018-01-10 22:41:39 Treat your beard nicely, and he'll return the favor. #oil #comb #norevenge
756 2018-01-10 22:41:36 Off Florida after mounting pressure... I.) Reported Probe FBI agents text messages for ordinance of leaks... J.) Bannon steps down as executive chairman for Breitbart news... K.) Iran oil tanker burning for 3rd day, may explode as crew still missing...
757 2018-01-10 22:41:16 Many oil fired furnaces in New England are quite modern devices. Natural gas is fine if you live in a reasonably well-populated area with enough customers to justify distribution systems.
Propane and fuel oil are more logical for rural areas.
758 2018-01-10 22:41:12 Make sure it’s sweet almond oil. :)
759 2018-01-10 22:41:10 Completely agree!! He’s always been a snake oil salesman
760 2018-01-10 22:40:57 What are the chances there will be an oil spill affecting Mar-a-lago if there are no oil drills in the area?  Think he did it for @FLGovScott? Think again.  Just like the windmills off the coast of his Scotland golf coast that he protested against.
761 2018-01-10 22:40:53 ราคา เท่าไหร่ครับ
762 2018-01-10 22:40:45 OIL DIFF: 5.79 -> 5.83

764 2018-01-10 22:40:31 Wait until NYC realizes there has never been a study on how much of #GlobalWarming #climatechange is caused by humans, let alone oil companies. This will cost hundred$ of million$. Innocent until proven guilty... remember NYC?

766 2018-01-10 22:40:24 1) Hey Sam, I want to share my thoughts on the subject. Energy independence or dominance or whatever you want to call it (since President Reagan, everyone renames it and comes up with similar projects) is more about cutting down dependence on ME oil and increasing its own output
767 2018-01-10 22:40:23 エルザに殴られたなう
768 2018-01-10 22:40:23 Look no further than Venezuela which also has an economy primarily dependent on oil.  Without oil, Norway would be very different and much poorer than it is.
769 2018-01-10 22:40:21 Think of how those oil platforms right off Maine's coast will help our energy savings! I can't wait! How about you Susan?
770 2018-01-10 22:40:15 It's more the sourcing that's the issue. Palm oil is 'natural' (or what most people define as natural) but it's super bad for the ecology how we typically source it, which people don't think of bc ya know natural and trees and what not
771 2018-01-10 22:40:12 Hi Craig/Lesley, advice for a cleanser please, my skin oxidises throughout the day and goes very dark, is the cleansing oil ok for this?why is this happening to my skin? Any advice?
772 2018-01-10 22:40:11 Offshore oil spills affect marine life through direct contact (inhalation and digestion) and causes damage to many vital organs!It is also harmful to the surrounding communities, studies show it can cause cancer, immune system suppression, and lead to reproductive failure!#RESIST

780 2018-01-10 22:39:37 Might have put a little to much oil in the bread will see for sure when it comes out.

783 2018-01-10 22:39:09 Lots of very good volunteer groups here. And such a strong arts community - grass roots to be sure, but some exceptional opportunities. Way better than the yyc arts scene despite all the schools & oil money

786 2018-01-10 22:39:03 Hey Susan... how will you like those oil drilling platforms off Maine's coast? Bet that will help tourism!
787 2018-01-10 22:39:01 It's like cod liver oil: ya' hate it, but it's good for ya'. Good luck.
788 2018-01-10 22:38:58 Looking at recent usage, "peak oil" now means "peak oil demand".

792 2018-01-10 22:38:24 So nice to hear the talented @kristen_shilton on @TSN1260 . Great interview and thanks for the Leaf talk here in Oil Country.

795 2018-01-10 22:38:04 Look at the US. 15 years ago or so it was written off as a major supplier of oil and gas. Today it is the #1 producer of gas and may soon be #1 also in oil. And then... we have the methane clathrates...
796 2018-01-10 22:37:54 What would you recommend  to get next bath oil bath bomb what are your favorite products thanks!

798 2018-01-10 22:37:51 ALL VOICES MATTER IN ALL STATES! WA & Oregon's coast depends on tourism as well. Are you going to allow oil rigs to set up near the Cascadia Fault? Cuz that would be fracking brilliant. Cascadia goes Yellowstone goes. Buh bye Montana.

811 2018-01-10 22:36:26 well played
812 2018-01-10 22:36:18 Coconut oil has actually done wonders for growing my brows out the last month or so
813 2018-01-10 22:36:17 Calgary’s value was tied to oil head offices/executives. They looked at yeg as too blue collar, etc. But infinitely more resilient.
814 2018-01-10 22:36:13 Can't deal with all that oil.
815 2018-01-10 22:36:10 LOL. NYC is suing 5 major oil companies. Advice: Cease and desist selling fuel there immediately until lawsuit is settled.
816 2018-01-10 22:36:09 I love this! Especially the Self Love + Beauty. Sugar Scrub!  Coconut Oil!  Face mask!  You know how to pamper! 
817 2018-01-10 22:36:00 brand new tires, oil change and a full tank of gas for my car today.
818 2018-01-10 22:35:59 I recommend something even more simple - Coconut Oil.
819 2018-01-10 22:35:55 They made a baby oil gel, works great!

823 2018-01-10 22:35:31 What terrifies me the most is he is so malleable the GOP are just using him to sign off on all the Koch Bros policies with no push back at all.  Look at all the new legislation passed favoring the oil industry at the expense of renewables.

825 2018-01-10 22:35:29 InfoChip's #RFID products are ideal for industries like oil & gas, rigging, lifting, #mining, #aerospace, construction, & rental companies.

827 2018-01-10 22:35:19 We need a free market, but Apple needs to follow stricter rules than oil companies.
828 2018-01-10 22:35:17 Nobody in California, Oregon, or Washington wants your stinking oil wells either.
829 2018-01-10 22:35:15 That is obviously a very difficult question. On the supply side, I will never bet against the oil / natural gas industry. Just when it seems we are running out of them here come entrepreneurs and change the market completely.

834 2018-01-10 22:34:54 120 kcal though for a tbspn of olive oil? Surely it's something to be used sparingly?
835 2018-01-10 22:34:49 Als het aan mij ligt werd @Shell vandaag opgesplitst, net als Standard Oil destijds. Dit is ongezond.
836 2018-01-10 22:34:45 In the meantime, we burned ten's of millions of dirty expensive oil during the recent cold weather, clean efficient combined cycle gas plants unable to get natural gas. The need for increased gas pipeline capacity is needed ASAP.
837 2018-01-10 22:34:21 If that's all these people keep worrying about is tourism industry while drilling for oil. We need to lower our gas prices in NC not raise them. Aling with other prices of products and services

841 2018-01-10 22:33:47 Look at all that hate dripping as if you knew one thing about conservatives and what we care about. You have NO IDEA and you are SO UNBELIEVABLY stupid about POISONING the planet that you really should NOT Even speak. Those of us who have done oil and gas all our HARD LIVES
842 2018-01-10 22:33:43 This looks like an oil painting. 
843 2018-01-10 22:33:33 It was terrible for like an hour!!! Luckily I closed my door and I have an essential oil diffuser in my office.

847 2018-01-10 22:33:15 Essential oil of pennyroyal is amazing for getting rid of pantry moths. Very contra indicated in pregnancy but I'm assuming that won't be an issue just at the moment!
848 2018-01-10 22:32:53 "Be the best"; at what? Mindlessly following orders of a psychopathic elite to kill strangers for oil. Come on, there's a better way to live than this.
849 2018-01-10 22:32:51 Whispers of $80 Oil Are Growing Louder. I believe an investigation for price fixing among the Oil Companies is in order. These price increases will only lead to more electric cars on the road which will damage the environment when the batteries are discarded.
850 2018-01-10 22:32:36 Sadly we are NOT using or getting ANY USA oil! Its sent to china
851 2018-01-10 22:32:34 You do.  Snake oil salesman
852 2018-01-10 22:32:23 If the oil companies lose, they can raise the price of a gallon by $2.00. Just in NY. Should have that baby paid off in no time.

859 2018-01-10 22:31:23 Now, as I watch the sunrise.
Ah, the smell of oil, the morning light.
There's but one shadow cast on the asphalt.
860 2018-01-10 22:31:20 @NYCMayor I appreciate you suing oil companies for contributing to climate change. Don’t you think it’s time to stop being a hypocrite and go #Vegan ? You are contributing to climate change as well sir. Make the connection, U can’t be an environmentalist and not be vegan in 2018.
861 2018-01-10 22:31:13 Too bad Trump isn't in any sort of position of power to do something about that. Guess he'll just continue to give huge money to oil and coal and remove benefits for renewable power.
862 2018-01-10 22:31:08 Oh she's over there live puffing on her oil, it must not b working cause she's nasty again.
863 2018-01-10 22:31:05 Why only Fla?  These beautiful waters belong to US.  Not big oil  You stop this nonsense now.  This is wrong.  Too bad your parents didn't raise you right.  They must be ashamed.
864 2018-01-10 22:31:04 Super easy lol I got some vegan Spelt bread from Whole Foods... get some organic pizza sauce which mines was tomato basil  also got this vegan cheese I get from Publix.. toasted it in a pan like grilled cheese in coconut oil. I also seasoned the sauce a bit
865 2018-01-10 22:30:55 the only campaign I was ever in, I trapped a priest in my beard and then set fire to his church by smearing beard oil on it. I’ve never seen a DM look...so confused.
866 2018-01-10 22:30:40 I have. There are a lot of interested families being “left out” for one reason or another. I’m still looking for a single interested patient who qualifies and is successfully able to purchase cannabis oil through CURT.
867 2018-01-10 22:30:36 If it had been diverse enough prior to 2014, then we would have been shielded from the worst of the effects of the drop in the price of oil.  Alberta-wide, we faired better than #yyc did because too much of corporate Calgary depended on O&G.

Hopefully this helps oust Netanyahu.
873 2018-01-10 22:30:09 Didn’t know 15 minute drive thru oil change existed until right now but so glad that it does.
874 2018-01-10 22:30:04 My oil change is $25 lmao
875 2018-01-10 22:30:03 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
876 2018-01-10 22:29:56 We are that cool underground band. The one with a real industrial space. Noises, wind draft and machine oil smell and all.
877 2018-01-10 22:29:36 I grew up fairly wealthy but my mom did not so they bought me an old car, manual and I had to pay for upkeep. I learned quickly how to replace my breaks change my oil and rebuild a carburetor, saved me a ton of money.

888 2018-01-10 22:27:33 Yip I do. The evidence is those darned accounts you want to deny.  They clearly demonstrate that in years of poor oil revenues, Scotland can continue its high level of public service spending because of UK funding. Benefits of a union.
889 2018-01-10 22:27:31 45 praised Norway for HYDRO but throws his support behind big oil and coal.  Puerto Rico needs HYDRO!!!

892 2018-01-10 22:26:54 Like it would be a bad thing. Don't you want more jobs, growing economy and stop buying oil from another country. As slow as solar and wind are doing much of anything NOW, 2% isn't enough to keep us going. I can afford an electric car like you politicians.
893 2018-01-10 22:26:54 The white truck moved.  Backed to old faithful now
894 2018-01-10 22:26:35 I don't know the story behind his thinking? All I do know is our Country has moved into oil and power independence. At the CA/NV border, CA built a solar field selling the power to NV Google it, it's amazing
895 2018-01-10 22:26:34 Received a poorly lit, painfully loud snap from Francis, who tells me between sobs he's at the bottom of an oil reserve about to have his dick drilled off!

I'm guessing no and that they don't see the irony of their actions.

902 2018-01-10 22:26:03 Sadly, the coastlines of America will suffer even more damage than we've seen in the past, the deaths of marine life & important undersea biology will be further destroyed by trump's & ill-advised scheme to drill for oil; say good-bye to beautiful beaches & sandy shores! (No pun)
903 2018-01-10 22:26:01 Trump - a complete embarrassment. Here is Trump: Hillary bad, no collusion, no collusion, i won electoral college, hard to do that; israel has walls, all troubles gone; Obama weak; Hillary is not for oil, for windmills; no collusion, no collusion, I am smart; Norway has water.

910 2018-01-10 22:25:29 I use the benefit pore primer. I haven’t checked the ingredients in it but it does give off a little bit of a silicon feel (I’m sure you’ve tried it). My moisturizer is Mary Kay & is indeed oil free. I’ve tried A LOT trust me...I think it’s just my skin. I’m fuglies

920 2018-01-10 22:25:00 This is a false narrative. Trump wants to expand energy production which has been crippling oil economies around the world. HRC would have banned fracking resulting in higher oil prices. AlGore Omaha wanted gas to be $5/ gal. They loved it when oil traded $150/bbl
921 2018-01-10 22:24:53 Dang!!! Looks like PLUR is in the citral reformulation list and our supplier is out of stock on the oil, so that one is headed for a premature retirement. Huge bummer! That is/was one of our top sellers. 
922 2018-01-10 22:24:50 I buy tinned sardines in olive oil. If I can't get those I get the ones in sunflower oil. Which do other people buy?

No.
928 2018-01-10 22:24:09 Yeah it really is about adjusting to the oil pattern and the other bowlers and their lines. If it's high oil etc.  What is your house shot like? Mines usually kinda dry so I use a pearl ball.

935 2018-01-10 22:23:19 Make sure you give them a good coating oil! We had a prefect thumb print in rust within a week on the bolt of one of ours!
936 2018-01-10 22:23:17 The UK Government gave extensive tax relief also to the oil companies,which seem to be looking for an easy way out of abandonment costs now.Maybe tax relief over a long period should be reviewed to see if relief for abandonment provisions has already been taken?

943 2018-01-10 22:22:51 It's not. It's just how traditional finance interacts with assets. Nobody is ever going to physically hold crude oil. The ETF is for the institutional investors, not the retail investors or actual users.

947 2018-01-10 22:22:26 Great. They should donate all the products they have that use oil too lol. Waste of time and money but they can do what they want.
948 2018-01-10 22:22:23 Funny how searching TWS for Patrick Fitzgerald doesn't produce quite the same sentiment.  Now what if Fitzgerald had decided to start investigating W's oil companies or his management of the Rangers?
949 2018-01-10 22:22:14 Can you elaborate? Holding oil companies to account for their actions is one step in the process of decarbonizing the world, but it's not the only step. Why does holding them to account deflect responsibility, and from whom?
950 2018-01-10 22:22:11 Strong words from @NYCMayor during presser announcing lawsuit against Big Oil on behalf of New Yorkers suffering from climate effects: "Morally we know what these companies have done to the Earth" (lawyer up- ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP, Shell, and ConocoPhillips)
951 2018-01-10 22:22:08 @NGRPresident Credit to crude oil appreciation, last chance to truly diversify our mono economy, lesson from Saudi & Qatar
952 2018-01-10 22:22:06 Why is the US only cutting $285 million in 2018 & 2019? Why isn't the US cutting at least $2 billion? There are oil rich nations worth trillions of dollars in the UN. Let them make up the difference.

968 2018-01-10 22:20:33 We are spending billions on dirty oil fired generation during peak loads before your 100% renewable goal is met. Let us know when your 100% goal is expected to be completed, in the meantime, oil costs skyrocket.

971 2018-01-10 22:19:47 Right, lol. One doesn't herd truck loads of opposing jihadists into trenches to be shot, sell children as sex slaves, sell captured oil and crucify Christians because he had a few less strips of camels ass than the other jihadi.
972 2018-01-10 22:19:42 Cocoa butter or vegetable oil lmao
973 2018-01-10 22:19:41 Listen, essential oil shill, if you are going to claim Young Living is FDA approved you are going to find out exactly what the FDA thinks of them.
974 2018-01-10 22:19:32 Sorry you don’t like it, but budgets require tough decisions. Tearing down hospitals was terrible policy. Choosing not to take on billions in costs during the oil collapse was prudent. If you keep running deficits, the province will eventually become handcuffed.
975 2018-01-10 22:19:30 first league season! i've been moving around a lot trying to find where i should be on a house shot. i don't have enough revs to make it back from the first or second arrow but playing further in means i can't cut through the heavier oil and the ball just sort of sits there
976 2018-01-10 22:19:24 Are you thinking about reducing your plastic and maybe getting rid of it altogether? Seeing as it’s PET (made from oil)? #plasticpollution #Environmental
977 2018-01-10 22:19:15 Why did our dollar drop with the oil increase? Nothing makes any sense???!!!
978 2018-01-10 22:19:13 太るから?だから僕を突き放すの?オイルが嫌いなの?オイルに罪は無いだろう…?
979 2018-01-10 22:19:09 The oil drilling is less a partisan issue and rather a geographical issue. In the Central Valley areas around the Inglewood oil field, it's a popular economic generator. However, in coastal areas, they are eyesores that depress housing values.
980 2018-01-10 22:19:07 Waiting for my car to get it's oil changed I had 2 beers and I'm buzzin, definetly not as good as I once was
981 2018-01-10 22:19:01 I loved that comment....after ragging on Hillary about pushing “wind mills,” he raves about Norway and hydro power. Ahhh, alternate power sources to oil and gas..both. One good because he needed to butter up the Norwegian PM, the other bad because it was Hillary’s thought.
982 2018-01-10 22:18:58 Looks like a collosal essential oil diffuser built to mask the stink of Chicago corruption.
983 2018-01-10 22:18:58 How much does it cost to extract a barrel of oil and how much is it selling for?
984 2018-01-10 22:18:37 No on GDP = Q1 seasonality 
3% already there when it's prime age labor force
3% 10 year, If oil moves higher, PMI data higher and we get a strong core CPI & PCE move together
3 Rates hikes, yes especially if the 10 year yield is in the upper channel band
985 2018-01-10 22:18:33 oil on canvas: "Four o'clock (Study after Hidden Law) is a common feature of prenatal ultrasound" (Another Crap Art TM 1997)

987 2018-01-10 22:18:10 At this point I just look at it as a blessing in disguise that activist judges and the Ninth Circus creates a situation where SCOTUS has to intervene and eventually rule in our favor and settle the issue once and for all.
988 2018-01-10 22:18:06 Solar & wind power are two sources of energy that do not pollute. On the other hand, oil is one of the top polluters. He has a bias—aka pocketbook—which clouds his vision. Sad to see ppl who are so greedy that they could care less about the environment & only   Block idiots!
989 2018-01-10 22:18:06 Great job. How refreshing to hear the unfiltered update on Florida offshore oil and gas.
990 2018-01-10 22:18:06 I just saw were NYC is suing Big Oil Companies for Climate Change. Maybe Big Oil should stop selling oil products in NYC!
991 2018-01-10 22:18:00 Stop dependence on foreign oil!

We invaded Iraq for oil!

Whoa, you can't drill anywhere.

Same people.
992 2018-01-10 22:17:59 Make sure all of the oil companies immediately quit selling them gasoline for any of the city vehicles
993 2018-01-10 22:17:58 The other option is for Liberals to accuse him of keeping the oil proceeds for his own account. Take a nap. You're losing too much sleep thinking up dumb shit.
994 2018-01-10 22:17:53 why is canned tuna always packed in oil in this country? I wanna put mayo on my tuna but if there's already oil that just seems... excessive
995 2018-01-10 22:17:50 currently taking the most relaxing bath ever, wearing a face mask, burning an essential oil candle, and listening to fleetwood mac. a vibe

997 2018-01-10 22:17:42 What of Taraba and Adamawa
998 2018-01-10 22:17:36 A lot of people expecting more oil. Better not let us down
999 2018-01-10 22:17:33 Lit I'll wake up w a wet face, use an oil sheet, apply the moisturiser n I'm good for MAYBE 2 hours. MAYBE.
1000 2018-01-10 22:17:02 Can't wait until ALL of the Oil
Companies do the same thing! 
Gas prices should go WAY down.
We should see $1.50 soon and
$1.00 a gallon later this year. 
Unless they don't pass their
Gigantic HUGE Windfall on. 
1001 2018-01-10 22:16:54 The key is intake of DHA and EPA. ALA (fairly easy to consume from plants) does not substitute. Vegans can supplement with algal-based supplements instead of fish oil. Minimum: 1000mg /day DHA+EPA combined
1002 2018-01-10 22:16:53 I have a lot in common with olive oil - we’re both greasy, feel at home with bread, and are extra-virgin.
1003 2018-01-10 22:16:48 Let's just hope and manifest that all the things that Trump is undoing, can be fixed in about the same time it took to un-do them.

We need to stop it before they start building oil rigs off the coast in Cali and elsewhere.

1005 2018-01-10 22:16:44 my mother gave me a fish oil supplement and I broke it in half and swallowed the oil from it. don't ever do that if you like yourself.
1006 2018-01-10 22:16:43 You know you’re an adult when getting an oil change makes you happy :-)
1007 2018-01-10 22:16:41 Exciting press conf @NYCMayor   and @NYCComptroller - positive global impacts probable fr whacking the wallets of big oil via lawsuits for damages to NYC by #Exxon.   NYrkrs are many things, but not climate chumps (h/t @billmckibben)
1008 2018-01-10 22:16:29 Oliver oil soap. One bar outperforms 3 plastic bottles of shower gel by far!
1009 2018-01-10 22:16:24 Oh I’m loving the so call women who are shaming her cause she named Mo and Steve! She spoke the damn truth it’s time for change I swear I wish i had some baby oil and a belt! As a woman I am mad and want to hit something
1010 2018-01-10 22:16:21 I know it’s not the same thing, but have you tried an essential oil pen? From like Monq or Corked? Has a very similar feeling...deff comfortable
1011 2018-01-10 22:16:19 RELATABLE. i literally use so much oil controlling products yet does it control those oils ? absolutely not. mattifying powders and foundations ? for like 3 hours and then wow foundation who’s she ???
1012 2018-01-10 22:16:18 I am confused. So if Dapper worked a normal job, but it meant he had to work away for a bit on business meetings or on the oil rigs then that would make him a scumbag as well because he left his child at home with a perfectly capable mother

1016 2018-01-10 22:15:51 Just got a free oil change and tire rotation 
1017 2018-01-10 22:15:41 Oil rigs are soooo lovely especially at the beach.
1018 2018-01-10 22:15:31 What is your favorite oil to use on your hair? #curlcentric #naturalhair
1019 2018-01-10 22:15:30 I’ve never painted with oil before and I’m super excited to try it! It definitely blends better than acrylic, which is what I’ve always used but then gotten frustrated that it never blends out right! Ugh!

sounds kinda badass

1022 2018-01-10 22:15:02 @ChefTomKerridge enjoying your new show. Beware the one cal fat spray as some suggest this damages the non-stick ability of the pan and better to use a little oil in pan first. But ok to spray food later.
1023 2018-01-10 22:15:00 Venezuela? Peace for a fortnight war within a month or two, more oil than iran?
1024 2018-01-10 22:14:56 I'm trying to get into CBD oil
1025 2018-01-10 22:14:56 What if the oil companies decided not to do business with NYC .. he’d get his green agenda very quickly.
1026 2018-01-10 22:14:54 Best to apply frankincense oil to exposed skin at night as it can make skin sensitive to sunlight. This product that Nina has shown is perfect.

1030 2018-01-10 22:14:39 Putting more slug in the swamp #tRump is... RT @JillK1964: Does everyone know the tax cut also cut 9 cents per barrel of oil paid by oil companies for emergency oil spill clean-up fund?? And now they want to drill off both U.S. coasts? WTF??!!
1031 2018-01-10 22:14:34 It all sounds lovely; but where is this "severance" money coming from at the one time? AND.... is it fair to think the other unions will be offered similar offers? NLTA, CUPE, Nurses, etc. I hope oil stays above 60$ a barrel.
1032 2018-01-10 22:14:31 Oil is up 50 cents today, to $63.50. #LikingIt
1033 2018-01-10 22:14:29 Bill De Blasio can't be bothered to get the subway trains to run effectively but yeah sure why not waste resources suing oil companies for global warming. Try launching nuclear waste into space while you're at it, old man.
1034 2018-01-10 22:14:28 This Norway state is oil rich like a motherfucker.
1035 2018-01-10 22:14:28 thank u CBD oil for giving me relief from my anxiety since im not about that blazing up before work life
1036 2018-01-10 22:14:17 Do either of you watch the Oilers? Subban left his stick attached to McDavid last night with a hook and it was not called. Maroon almost had his balls lopped off, not called.  The oil are bad but the calls need to be made.
1037 2018-01-10 22:14:06 ... large oil companies continued to damage the environment well after they became aware that they were doing that.  Why should NYers be stuck paying for all of this?
1038 2018-01-10 22:14:05 me vs olive oil
1039 2018-01-10 22:14:00 @michaelsantoli in the broad spectrum of things that can disrupt the market, what do you think might blind side us? War? Rates? Oil? Currencies? Rogue Algorithm?
1040 2018-01-10 22:13:42 Oh, daddy trump will be mad at you even talking about that pesky science stuff. You better post pictures of you with oil and coal lobbyists and hope he doesn’t hear on Fox you said the word scientific research.

1045 2018-01-10 22:13:18 Your EPA CHIEF IS KILLING THE ENVIRONMENT! With you opening up offshore drilling it’s killing the environment. The oil doesn’t even come to America!

1054 2018-01-10 22:12:17 The opening of coastal waters for increased oil and gas drilling by the Trump Administration, with an exemption for Florida, could very well leave California with zero congressional Republicans.

1066 2018-01-10 22:11:03 I use them a lot, keeps fat content down brilliantly. I still use oil for some things, I just like the taste for some dishes.
1067 2018-01-10 22:11:00 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
1068 2018-01-10 22:10:59 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
1069 2018-01-10 22:10:58 That is sooo sad!! The are amongst the silent sufferers while right wing politicians and oil tycoons lie about climate change to confuse Americans who are easily misled.

1072 2018-01-10 22:10:38 Effectiveness wise, you can’t go wrong with something like our Absorb Pure+.... being water based, it has up to 10 times the absorption of an oil!
1073 2018-01-10 22:10:35 Our prices closely track the crude oil price, we pass on reductions as quickly as we can, and shield our customers from dramatic price increases. Thanks - Chris 3/3
1074 2018-01-10 22:10:19 I wonder if they baffled the sumps? Commissioned a road tyres v slicks test with a 3-series when I was at Auto Express and the track cornering forces were such they starved the engine of oil and lunched it!
1075 2018-01-10 22:10:19 Like all single-serving sandwich cheeses not made by Kraft (according to their old commercials), I too am made mostly of oil and water.
1076 2018-01-10 22:10:17 That would raise the price of oil by $42 a barrel. More than half of the current cost. Try that and in turn we would see exports of oil to Mexico stop, lose the revenue generated by it and instantly add a boom to Canada’s or a EU country’s economy
1077 2018-01-10 22:10:17 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.

1081 2018-01-10 22:10:10 I lived in Norway for a few years,  what an awesome place.  They rely heavily on offshore oil production and exuberant taxation to support their lifestyle. Maybe one day we can drill like the Norwegians and eliminate our reliance on foreign oil.
1082 2018-01-10 22:10:06 I would love to have the first one ... the one with the candle and the oil I think

1085 2018-01-10 22:09:45 Drumpf cares not of the environment - he wants to drill in the ocean floor when oil is cheap, he will now allow coal slag to be put in streams — fairly unstable comments.
1086 2018-01-10 22:09:42 Great overview of technical indicators to look for before the market turns bearish. Thanks for taking the time to explain the market forecast everyday. Was looking for play on oil thanks for the overview of potential trade.
1087 2018-01-10 22:09:41 Baby oil & bleach in my bath water get me right every time 
1088 2018-01-10 22:09:40 I think you were smelling the stench of the toilet CA has become. I run a boat in the oil fields in LA. Sitting 500 meters from a flare I can’t smell anything but ocean air.
1089 2018-01-10 22:09:37 @GregAbbott_TX you have to pay all fire depts and get these stolen oil and gas filters from EDS and NEC out of the sewers .then lock them
1090 2018-01-10 22:09:37 Probably should have had the backup energy plan in place BEFORE you sue the oil companies, dummy.
1091 2018-01-10 22:09:28 Alberta is recovering over and above what other oil provinces are experiencing because of the NDP and their refusal to implement austerity. Taxes pay for services. There is NOTHING excessive about AB's taxes.
1092 2018-01-10 22:09:24 New York Is Suing Oil Companies over Global Waming
1093 2018-01-10 22:09:10 @tabpaigewilson Paige - Your Oil & Gas Leaders podcast is the first I’ve heard of for that industry. Very cool! I’m in Bakersfield, huge O& G as you know. ~Dave

1098 2018-01-10 22:08:09 Sadly, our over-reliance on oil has over the years makes us lazy and unimaginative. In view of that, our government remains the manufacturer and producer of goods& services. Everybody relies on monthly alloc. The moment we have shortfalls even  markets shiver. This has to change
1099 2018-01-10 22:08:08 you're welcome! Cool down at lvl 1 is good too with oil/E build
1100 2018-01-10 22:08:01 where can i get the synthetic oil?
1101 2018-01-10 22:07:53 A slime that's made of liquid metal or black oil.

That's my best idea.
1102 2018-01-10 22:07:52 One of the dumbest thing the white shark has done was to sell  Africa guns. I see them carrying the gold and diamond back the Mother land. I see them begging for oil to keep warm. I see all kinds of slave ships. With Apes on the helm 
1103 2018-01-10 22:07:36 Use coconut oil
1104 2018-01-10 22:07:27 His motor oil may be synthetic, but those moves are all natural 
1105 2018-01-10 22:07:25 Plant based is a specific diet (excludes meat, eggs, dairy but also excludes refined sugar and oil), vegan is more of a“life style”avoiding animal products completely (including hygiene products, clothes, etc). Plant based usually revolves around personal health & is more lenient
1106 2018-01-10 22:07:20 I adore any and all lipsticks by @Clinique that I have ever bought and their Turnaround range, but if their Dramatically Different oil slick...er...alleged moisturiser ever comes within metres of me again in my life it will be too soon.
1107 2018-01-10 22:07:09 Every oil bust I went through when I was working in the oil industry, meant the industry got leaner and much meaner.
1108 2018-01-10 22:07:07 Yeah I've been testing pretty much all of PTR week and that quest with lvl 4 slow when oil is ignited is good

1113 2018-01-10 22:06:44 great! so you, would rather be one mistake away from an oil crises.

1116 2018-01-10 22:06:22 @GordonRamsay  Chef Ramsay, what kind of cookware do you use? How do you keep them from sticking really bad?  I bought some mid-cost (stainless steel) skillets and they stick horribly. I heated up oil in them, and it helped a bit, but it's far from perfect.
1117 2018-01-10 22:06:20 There's plenty of ways to make Mexico pay for the wall.

Withhold aid

20 percent tax on Mexican oil. 

increase tariffs 

#increased import taxes

Do you guys ever use your brains?
1118 2018-01-10 22:05:57 First, CNN doesn’t do you any favors! Second, get on board with off shore exploration and drilling! Oil and energy independence is a must for our country and S.C. should fully support this! The economic boost, job creation and so on would greatly help our citizens. Drill!
1119 2018-01-10 22:05:56 The risk exposure is far less for the other states you mention. Hurricanes/serious accidents + oil rigs + longest coastline in CONUS = higher risk & impact.  Getting FL off the table for this is like saying engineering strength for hospitals needs to be higher than houses.

Vin was getting weaker and weaker as he lost more oil, a sharp gurgle resonated in his throat. He was choking on his own blood now.

But it was just to much. A robot, just like any human, could only take so much.
1123 2018-01-10 22:04:57 So let’s start drilling for oil.
1124 2018-01-10 22:04:55 And by harmful regulations are you referencing the rollback if protections that will leave the NC coast susceptible to oil drilling? And the rollback on oil companies to provide $ for cleanup when they inevitably have an oil spill to clean up. #embarassment
1125 2018-01-10 22:04:46 I actually was thinking about painting a picture of them, but I haven’t decided which picture to do yet and I still need to buy some oil paints!

1145 2018-01-10 22:02:54 Internet dropped for an hour. I burned myself on hot oil. So how’s by you?
1146 2018-01-10 22:02:52 How many they get compared to other teams is irrelevant, the disparity to getting and giving is what matters. Based on that the Oil are still -21 whereas the Ducks are worst at -42. The Yotes leading w/ +26 and the Avs are +15. Oilers really don't have it that bad.
1147 2018-01-10 22:02:52 @accidntlmystic @maggiesmom1_mom some dude on twitter tried to convince me how solar power pollutes.  guy's twitter profile said he worked for more than a decade in the oil industry...that tells me he has no fucking idea what he's talking about.  I blocked the idiot.

1152 2018-01-10 22:02:36 Oversimplified? Maybe. But surely if rest of world (incl arms suppliers) wd rely less on oil & butt out, the Israel/Palestine conflict cd return 2 what it was - civil action between 2 groups.
1153 2018-01-10 22:02:33 I agree the game changer in the climate wars was George Mitchell making oil and gas much more abundant than was thought by the peak oil nuts.

1158 2018-01-10 22:01:52 Yes that is all correct.  Dry skin is often the result of the skin being low in oil.  That reduces the barrier function so you lose more water.  So your skin gets dry.  So what you believe and the terminology is all saying the same thing.
1159 2018-01-10 22:01:49 I got this sleeping potion essential oil mix from Sprout, put lavender in his diffuser/humidifier, and put a noise machine on. Bryson is sleeping way better now. A few weeks ago he went through something and these things has helped. Is it a sleep regression?

1164 2018-01-10 22:01:28 @NYCMayor is actually having #NYC sue some oil companies because of #climatechange. It will be interesting to see them try to PROVE climate change is caused by humans. Although if history continues, all they need is a liberal court with no proof.
1165 2018-01-10 22:01:20 When will oil companies admit global warming and climate change are a real concern?  When it stops making them money?   Thank God for Musk and Spacex...may be our next generation only option

1189 2018-01-10 21:59:58 Canada better put some thought into how we can have a vibrant economy when we have to stop producing our major export.  Getting off oil is obviously more urgent than most on the right accept. It is also going to be more challenging and disruptive than the left has acknowledged.
1190 2018-01-10 21:59:55 I eat way too much French bread and olive oil 
1191 2018-01-10 21:59:53 I use a "stick blender" (whatever they're called) for 2-3 minutes with the butter to keep it from separating when I add ice. It worked for ~3-4 hours today (I sipped for quite a while since it was my second caffeine of the day). Is the MCT oil different?

1240 2018-01-10 21:54:45 Be sure there is a process involving the Gov.& the UN. You are not the most important person regarding this. We do not need to develop coal & Oil here in the US. It will pollute our country& are both dangerous to pursue. Mining Coal takes lives due to illness or accidents.
1241 2018-01-10 21:54:41 I use MCT oil every day in my BPC. Once you become fat adapted, MCT oil is crucial. It bypasses your liver mostly, digests quickly & goes straight to your brain. Energy, mental acuity, helps you get into ketosis faster, etc... Basically it's the most pure fuel u can get on keto.
1242 2018-01-10 21:54:30 Senator Colin , you want off shore oil drilling?
Be sure your oil spills don’t reach the Canadian coast 
You will have to explain to your citizens why the fishing industry won’t exist after a major spill
1243 2018-01-10 21:54:29 Hi Tim I had a great day, gonna service the Honda scooter,  I have the complete maintenance service manual for it a 312pages book, so bought special oil and the sparkplug , new filters it's the 5000miles service interval service all my vehicles, Saves lot of 
1244 2018-01-10 21:54:29 —higher motivation that was for sure. She heard the door opening and chuckled.

"I'm awake, 20 minutes for oil? Really? Did you got lost downstairs?"

She was of course just teasing him a little bit, she was even grinning with both her hands—
1245 2018-01-10 21:54:28 Milk are good too but I find that the oil cleansers remove more makeup and dirt.
1246 2018-01-10 21:54:26  YESSSSS The water cream is in there!! And the oil cleanser is one of the best out there! Let me know how you love it baby
1247 2018-01-10 21:54:24 @realDonaldTrump If she's such a great friend did you ask her how #Norway has increased electric/hybrid car sales to 50% of new sales.Maybe your great friend should give you advice on how to get US gov out of bed w/oil companies & give US automakers a swift kick in the ass #Tesla

1249 2018-01-10 21:54:21 Very lucky hubby. Are you a fan of baby oil?
1250 2018-01-10 21:54:08 Better then Trump enabled oil..

1254 2018-01-10 21:53:40 WHAT A JOKE ON THE OIL DRILLING...NO OFF SHORE DRILLING IN FLORIDA WATERS WHAT ABOUT THOSE WIND MILLS...LOL TRUMP IS SO FAKE!
1255 2018-01-10 21:53:34 You are asking a smug rhetorical question, but my guess is yes, by burning oil (or consuming in any way i.e. through driving, heating home with it) you are directly or indirectly contributing to climate change.  But I am assuming that is not the lawsuit is about....
1256 2018-01-10 21:53:16 So Trump is holding the US hostage over @BorderWall. How did WE get put in the middle ? AND is putting every coast at risk with oil drilling? Great day at the office.
1257 2018-01-10 21:53:00 You really are an EEJIT  ! There is no way in a million years Wastemonster are you going to allow the Scottish government to get their hands on oil revenues  . Now why don't you try something else to ponder your mind on . Scottish politics is obviously beyond your comprehension.
1258 2018-01-10 21:52:54 I used a ready made kit thing just used 1 tea spoon of baking soda, 1 table spoon of water & 1 tablespoon of oil instead of an egg :))
1259 2018-01-10 21:52:43 Rents didn't like Ska music.  Grabbed the wrong liner notes for their intervention.  Instead of RBF they took MMBT.  Easier to explain Royal Oil than She's Got a Girlfriend Now.  Ban avoided.
1260 2018-01-10 21:52:42 Is it true that NYC has sued several major oil companies for their role in climate change?  If so, that could be the most ridiculous lawsuit since the college student sued her college because they didn't warn her that picketing on a highway was dangerous.
1261 2018-01-10 21:52:35 I mean... this is ridiculous that Florida is the only state excluded from the oil plan. Y’all know it’s because he’s got Mar A Lago down there 
1262 2018-01-10 21:52:35 It happened before, for oil, and it will happen again, for other reasons. If the world is so concerned with tackling terrorism they shouldn't look further than saudi arabia. If they talk so much about human rights look no further than Myanmar.
1263 2018-01-10 21:52:34 He's suing the oil companies now with those tax dollars. Must be nice to be a NYC resident
1264 2018-01-10 21:52:32 The REALITY IS,  soon as a hurricane or some tropical storm approaches the oil rigs,  it'll give an EXCUSE to the Oil Co. TO JACK UP PRICES
1265 2018-01-10 21:52:32 Yes, a purveyor of snake oil who pockets millions when he shills for sham products. He is disgraceful.
1266 2018-01-10 21:52:24 Let's discuss Farallon, Asian investments in oil bringing in millions. How about the hundreds of millions you made off of coal mine/coal powered plants in China. Invested in Maules Creek coal mine and the destroying the forest? Time to face reality hypocrite. #TomSteyer@ShaunKing

1268 2018-01-10 21:52:21 Unless wooden boards are frequently coated with a natural oil like linseed, food should not be repeatedly served on them. Food hygiene has gone out the window for the sake of a stupid trend.

1271 2018-01-10 21:51:52 Why would I add MCT oil to this, though? What purpose does it serve in this?

1274 2018-01-10 21:51:41 Singapore, Taiwan, HK, Denmark, as others have said. Places with high property taxes + high land values (Switzerland, Germany) are similar. Norway makes the value of its oil (a type of economic land) somewhat common property.
1275 2018-01-10 21:51:33 #BREAKING rump takes Florida off the table for drilling - big surprise...dumb owns property all over Florida and islands. Of course he does not to look at oil rigs while golfing. GET HIM OUT NOW. HE IS A JOKE.
1276 2018-01-10 21:51:28 As much as I love the SPATULA CITY scene in UHF, knowing how they filmed that movie in Tulsa all I can think of is how the store that was previously there probably closed after the mid-1980's oil bust.
1277 2018-01-10 21:51:19 It wasn’t a dumpster fire. More like an out of control bonfire next to an ocean laced with oil...
1278 2018-01-10 21:51:17 And, by extension...?

Wait, I forgot elliptical comments are lost on Republicans:  Who the hell DOES want to see oil Riggs -and the likely oil spills- from their shores???

1282 2018-01-10 21:51:14 Every state in the nation except Florida is mandated coast oil drilling & is completely unfair to the rest of US.  NJ tourism is just as huge at Jersey Shore.  #ClearConflict #Favortism #BullShit
1283 2018-01-10 21:51:09 Minnesotans. Please thank me later. I just put oil in my snowblower, which should mean I won’t need it anytime soon.

1289 2018-01-10 21:50:36 Shame on you!!! Yeah, can’t wait until y’all start drilling offshore here in Myrtle Beach!!! Can’t wait to see how a major oil spill will impact our beautiful shores.

1292 2018-01-10 21:50:20 Not yet - it was delivered this afternoon. That said, no coconut oil in this recipe, since it's iced.
1293 2018-01-10 21:50:08 funny how they’re not suing state-run oil companies, which account for 3/4 of production.
1294 2018-01-10 21:50:07 Their diet is also high carb (69%), low fat (21%) & they don’t tend to have diabetes either. Also important to differentiate between coconut & coconut oil. Low intakes of sugar, western foods etc. 1/2
1295 2018-01-10 21:50:01 The entire Administration has been trying to roll back the clock. Coal. Oil. Division. Isolation. Stupidity.

No thanks #DelusionalMan
1296 2018-01-10 21:50:00 2/2 I'm not an expert or anything, just an average person listening in on oil conversations at the restaurant. That being said, I bow to genuine experts. Are you an expert?
1297 2018-01-10 21:49:53 .@SecretaryZinke removed Florida from the offshore draft proposed plan Tuesday without consulting officials within the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, the @Interior agency which developed the plan: Interior and industry sources. Industry groups also not consulted #OOTT #oil
1298 2018-01-10 21:49:43 are you using MCT oil yet?
1299 2018-01-10 21:49:34 Oh good! Another meaningless feel good tweet from Lisa... but

I’m confused about oil drilling: so it’s very safe in ANWR, but not safe off of Florida (and Zinke says no drilling there) but @SenatorCollins doesn’t think it’s safe for Maine... so which is it?  #GOPTaxScam

1305 2018-01-10 21:49:12 Too bad you think you are smarter than all the other leaders.  There is no reason to drill more oil. We need to convert to wind turbines and solar.  This makes you look dumb, not smart
1306 2018-01-10 21:49:07 If KKK David Duke went up to Trump & said, we gotta get blacks back to Africa cause they are polluting the oil grilled air & David Duke hands him money...Trump will say, oh ok, I'll do it. He would do it, for money & cause he respects/relates to the KKK. Still could be suggested.

1332 2018-01-10 21:46:14 I remember from living in the UK references to cannabis resin, which I believe we called hash oil. Could this be a twisted reference to that?
1333 2018-01-10 21:46:11 How can they blame oil companies when NYC itself is 100% compliant? A huge city endlessly consuming without a second thought is retroactively looking for a scapegoat. Adorable.

1355 2018-01-10 21:44:13 @sullivanradio If a city wants to fight air pollution they should quit using oil and gas those companies make. Maybe the residents of the city should suit the city for causing pollution. And quit using Apple products and apps.
1356 2018-01-10 21:44:05 I find it easier just to oil myself.
1357 2018-01-10 21:43:51 @SecretaryZinke please keep your dirty oil off the “tourism dependent” Oregon coast too.
1358 2018-01-10 21:43:24 Yeah, it’s a process finding masks that Work. In the summer time try it with more vinegar and less oil if you tend to be oilier, but don’t skip the oil completely because it does help your skin regulate how much it produces. In the winter I add more oil bc I get rlly dry
1359 2018-01-10 21:43:20 Seems like a stupid move by @TheDemocrats. GOP should put all DACA negotiations with @TheDemocrats on hold until this is resolved.

1372 2018-01-10 21:41:36 anyone else creeped out about the connotations of those signs at artist run centres in economically depressed towns that say things like "Art is the new Oil"  or "Art is the new Steel"?

1375 2018-01-10 21:41:33 Amusing how all of a sudden FLORIDA is a Blue State when it comes to OIL DRILLING!  The Gov. doesn't want their beautiful water polluted.............:)
1376 2018-01-10 21:41:28 Love the character, but I have to work on a quicker retreat at times. And using the oil spill much close to me for more healing. Other than this watch em burn
1377 2018-01-10 21:41:26 Spring is on the way. Get ready to use ACT Concrete cleaner to clean the oil off your driveway.
 Have a great day. :)
1378 2018-01-10 21:41:06 Pinch of salt needed as based on ONS 'Experimental Data' publication. 2 split UK Public Finances & Revenues requires raft of assumptions about how these should be allocated 2 regions, most notably about north sea oil revenues (Scotland gets 8% or 75% depending on method!).
1379 2018-01-10 21:41:04 wouldn't say I'm a huge fan, but reckon they get a bit of a hard time. Not like the NE is overflowing with successful start ups outside of oil+gas.
1380 2018-01-10 21:41:02 Seafood, mineral oil, industrial machinery, medical supplies and tools, electronics, it's a pretty productive country.

1384 2018-01-10 21:40:50 Of course love!!! Hope it works out for ya! I have combo-dry skin and the ACV with it and coconut oil did wonders for my skin!!
1385 2018-01-10 21:40:49 We are too busy taking care of big business especially the oil companies. 52% of our entire budget is spent on the military.
We fight wars we can't win and instead of making companies pay their fair share we give them back money. CRAZY 
1386 2018-01-10 21:40:46 I thought I was doing a good job surviving without coffee today. Was in a pretty good mood. Then got bitched at maybe like 5 times and the oil change thing happened. Then here comes the waterworks  I hate myself

1395 2018-01-10 21:40:15 I also picked fruit in high school, I work in the oil fields right now and I would kill for a job at target. I don't have to wake up at 4 in the morning, get treated like shit and there is a.c. I would suck a sick for that job.

1398 2018-01-10 21:39:55 Remember that all energy and matter in the Universe is constant, Rude. All that oil and other fossil fuel is simply changing forms and space (where it resides). We just hope too much of it isn’t residing in our lungs and other bodily tissues. Just a thought.

1403 2018-01-10 21:39:40 Oil is selling big but won't sell big forever even though we've only discovered 30% of the world's oil reserves (allegedly). However, as palasa doesn't sell as much as smartphones, we need to be wise and scale things evenly.
1404 2018-01-10 21:39:35 PSA: Cheap knock off essential oils won't do anything for you and are actually toxic. Also, quit letting your babies breathe in eucalyptus and peppermint oil. It triggers more congestion. Research them and how they work. Dont use them just because it's a trend.

1409 2018-01-10 21:39:20 He wants to develop coal&oil energy that is horrible for the Env. & Dangerous to pursue. He must have an investment in this. I think there was a threat for war against Norway. She came to make sure he knew there are International Laws to abide by

1411 2018-01-10 21:39:06 Mix it with apple cider vinegar and the *smallest* amount of coconut oil. It strips the skins of toxins without being too harsh or drying. Other beauty oils work as well, so does rose water

1413 2018-01-10 21:39:04 Why don't they ban the sale of all oil based products?  Seems like the city government is complicit.
1414 2018-01-10 21:39:04 Bill DeBlasio another Lib nut job that like @NYGovCuomo actually believes he has a shot at being POTUS & will spend as much taxpayer money as he can on frivolous things like suing oil companies for global warming, to get his name in the paper. @NYCMayor @FoxNews
1415 2018-01-10 21:38:48 So, what's up with @SecretaryZinke ? He gave Florida a pass from oil drilling. Why? Is it because of your"Winter White House"?
1416 2018-01-10 21:38:32 Car wouldn't start when I was trying to leave Gamestop and believe me few things are scarier than not being able to escape Gamestop. Guess it's about time for an oil change lol

1421 2018-01-10 21:38:02 went to get an oil change before we head out & the guy tells me, oh you need brakes for the back & im like wtf aha my parents set me up 
1422 2018-01-10 21:37:54 @tedlieu By exempting Florida because of the threat to tourism, @SecretaryZinke acknowledges the danger oil drilling poses for ALL coastal states. Equal protection?

1429 2018-01-10 21:37:02 La historia hoy: en 1870, en USA, John D Rockefeller funda la Standard Oil Company, que se constituye en la más importante de la industria y controla desde la producción hasta la venta del petróleo. En 1911, fue acusada (Suprema Corte) de monopolio y obligada a desmembrarse.
1430 2018-01-10 21:36:58 He did just tweet that the cold snap in the US is proof that climate change is a hoax. My senator was also the guy that brought a snowball into congress. He's basically on the payroll of Oklahoma energy/oil companies.

1435 2018-01-10 21:36:35 He's also cluelessly advocating renewed emphasis on fossil fuels, and his own Energy Dept has disagreed with him on coal.  Perhaps you can agree with me that we need to cut tax-funded subsidies to oil/coal/gas companies and let them compete for profits naturally.
1436 2018-01-10 21:36:29 When i was in grade school in the 70’s, Teachers would preach about Global Cooling and the estimated end of oil.  “We’ll run out by 2025”  At least ONE of those things is not true— i’d say both.

1443 2018-01-10 21:36:01 I always enjoy those who literally ignore the socialist democracies Bernie and his supporters point to, mostly in Scandinavia, and instead point to Venezuela, a petro-state, which literally lives and dies over oil prices. Of course, you know this already....
1444 2018-01-10 21:36:00 For arguments sake, if ISIS takes land back, its theirs? If the Syrian govt. inevitably decides to grab back the oil fields east of Deir Ez-zor, what then? It becomes theirs again by rule of conquest? It isn't "their land" (yet), whether your support the Kurds or not.

1451 2018-01-10 21:35:12 You mean the trade surplus you have with Canada is not good enough? Remember, the USA does not have energy independence from the middle east without Canadian oil, which you get at a discounted rate through NAFTA. 45% of your oil.

1508 2018-01-10 21:29:48 I’m over here eating Poke jus chillin and I overheard a middle school girl say the words “Jessica put olive oil and salad on her ice cream SHES SO WACK”  like WTH y’all doing out here 
1509 2018-01-10 21:29:31 Nice!  Did it spew all its oil out 
1510 2018-01-10 21:29:26 a mix of frankincense and tea tree oil really gets my skin all the way together once it starts acting up
1511 2018-01-10 21:29:24 No, That is due to the gov't no giving AF after they use us for oil wars and central bank take-overs of sovereign countries. PTSD wouldn't be a thing if we were properly deprogrammed b4 getting out.  Bless your son Ma'am.
1512 2018-01-10 21:29:18 As he's ready to chop down 300,000 Giant Sequoia Trees, and endanger our ocean waters with oil rigs, and bring back filthy coal mines. Mmmm-k.
1513 2018-01-10 21:29:17 can’t wait to deep condition my hair & do a hot oil treatment this weekend  this cold has done my hair dirty
1514 2018-01-10 21:29:11 My truck is leaking something and im pretty sure it’s oil, great

1516 2018-01-10 21:29:04 It’s all they have to cling to. Kinda like Rose at the end of Titanic.
1517 2018-01-10 21:28:54 Is it alright to put just frankincense oil on your face at anytime?
1518 2018-01-10 21:28:52 my face and scalp is bad with oil/grease. i have to make sure to wash face/scalp everyday. witch hazel is a good facial astringent. I use it before sleeping only. Covering head (scalp/forehead) while in bed. u be surprised how much more grease/oil comes off scalp than face
1519 2018-01-10 21:28:47 I’m sure there’s an oil for that too 
1520 2018-01-10 21:28:32 Botswana is very very dependent upon mining. Similar to... Venezuela's dependence on oil no? When the prices of said minerals goes down, so will their economy, and by by will the success story of Botswana.
1521 2018-01-10 21:28:30 RT SeaSaveTweet "RT SenFeinstein: Blocking the Trump plan to expand offshore oil drilling is a top priority of mine in 2018. We don’t want to be one mistake away from environmental catastrophe. The dangers are too great!"
1522 2018-01-10 21:28:23 Clove oil, Monday a long way off for toothache...
1523 2018-01-10 21:28:14 Wonder if anyone filing this suit has ever used oil or any oil based products? Never been on a plane, owned a car or paid for a ride in a taxi... simple life I guess.
1524 2018-01-10 21:28:00 Argan oil is great!xx
1525 2018-01-10 21:27:55 #thetruthaboutlookinggood Don't be going for lotions and potions.  I never use a thing on my skin apart from water or coconut oil, never have and never will! It's all just marketing to make you feel bad about yourself - Don't buy into it! <3 x
1526 2018-01-10 21:27:47 Hey Bill. You do realize that oil companies don't control the weather, right? Or that New York sits on a bight, which is literally the WORST place a city could be during a hurricane?

1530 2018-01-10 21:27:18 Lester's Oil radio advertising comes up with the perfect oxymoron: "...join our no commitment Loyalty Club"!
1531 2018-01-10 21:27:09 I really like cleansing oil
1532 2018-01-10 21:27:05 Because all 12 of their viewers are obsessed with it.
1533 2018-01-10 21:27:01 Paracetamol and oil of cloves, or just drink bottle of scotch 
1534 2018-01-10 21:26:37 It's all about big oil and their freakin lobbyist with these people ...heck with a clean environment ...been gettin trashed in Louisiana forever already.
1535 2018-01-10 21:26:31 I take multivits with iron (although I was taking those pre-C as well). I also now take cod liver oil but again more cos I'm getting old rather than anything specific to the C. No idea if they do any good but I figure they don't do any harm! #bccww
1536 2018-01-10 21:26:31 There's professional organizations for all different fields. I've attended luncheons & socials for architecture, advertising, oil & gas, politics, and general ones for young professionals. You can def network here and get leads on connects in other cities
1537 2018-01-10 21:26:28 Brakes brake flush and an oil change and now I'm not sure if I can afford to put gas in
1538 2018-01-10 21:26:28 I been using jojoba oil as a facial moisturizer and I love it. It doesn’t leave my face greasy either
1539 2018-01-10 21:26:16 F'ing hypocrites! If trump doesn't want an oil dump in Mar Largo, well guess what A Hole, neither do we in VIRGINIA!

1541 2018-01-10 21:25:40 How could coconut oil cause chd? Kitavans eat 18% satfat all coconut and get NO chd. Michael Mosley you need to read a lot more :(
1542 2018-01-10 21:25:31 We will have 8% of UK assets,that covers the deficit with spare,we are an oil and gas rich country,we will be able to borrow for growth,which has never happened in scotland,WM has held scots economy back for decades to discourage nat support
ALL scots paid a price for that.
1543 2018-01-10 21:25:28 oil makes my face so fucking itchy im in hell right now
1544 2018-01-10 21:25:25 Just Florida? You know about ocean currents? Ban oil drilling off of all US coastlines
1545 2018-01-10 21:25:18 Building a wall and destroying habitats, having children who kill animals for fun, withdrawing from a global climate protection agreement, supporting the oil industry, opposing renewable energy.. yes, of course, @realdonaldtrump feels very strongly about the environment.
1546 2018-01-10 21:25:16 @JulepBeauty Hi @JulepBeauty , I am using your face care kit. Do I do the cleanser oil/exfoliating sponge/white liquid twice daily? So far I love this kit!

1549 2018-01-10 21:25:02 I know it's real important to let my cable company control my internet access and allow oil companies to drill on every inch of coastline, but #SaveCHIP.

1551 2018-01-10 21:24:56 Just like a car, my oil needs changing.
1552 2018-01-10 21:24:49 Goop is filled with people selling snake oil. I’m not sure why anybody trusts anything they say or sell at this point.

1555 2018-01-10 21:24:35 So, when are you taking your cat in to have its oil changed and tires rotated?
1556 2018-01-10 21:24:35 Pulling the Midnight Oil
1557 2018-01-10 21:24:31 Absolute idiot. You should be thanking every oil company for all the GOOD they've done. Commie.
1558 2018-01-10 21:24:18 aW that sucks but ill try the tea tree oil on it thank you!!
1559 2018-01-10 21:24:11 OCTAVIAN USED FUCKING COOKING OIL TO CLEAN OUR FLOORS  Talk about I used PINE SOL 
1560 2018-01-10 21:24:02 I also want to shed fat & have mental clarity.. soo, it's end of day 2 of keto + IF. 75% fat = 380g for me but I only hit ~280 on both days. I have a whole mozerella ball with lunch, a bunch of brie with dinner. 5-6 tablespoons of olive oil/day. Idk how to up my fats any more!
1561 2018-01-10 21:23:38 so im sitting waiting to get my oil changed & who walks in the waiting room?? my lovely little sister
1562 2018-01-10 21:23:34 It's too early on in the year to be burning the midnight oil actually 
1563 2018-01-10 21:23:18 does Hop Stoopid still smell like diff oil?
1564 2018-01-10 21:23:11 So instead our stable genius gives away the store and lets oil companies drill in the ocean and national parks .... except by Mar-a-Largo
1565 2018-01-10 21:23:08 I think I should start using beard oil, but like what the fuck do I get?? What do I do??? Is it worth it?? Beard boiz help me!
1566 2018-01-10 21:23:01 Hope you oil up your sweet ass on stage at @SapphireNYC next weekend 
1567 2018-01-10 21:23:01 I got an abrasion on it a few months ago then got peppermint oil in it the other day smh 
1568 2018-01-10 21:23:01 Ladies day at the oil change place #winning
1569 2018-01-10 21:22:55 Note: Norway runs an annual deficit of $C160 billion. Only under NDP has Alberta's debt risen. BTW Offshore drilling is not as demanding a process as oil sands recovery.
1570 2018-01-10 21:22:42 In 2005 I didn’t even know what the left and right was now I’m the vp of bushwick oil and all I do is hang out with republicans
1571 2018-01-10 21:22:38 of environmental emergencies, what did the Oil and Gas Activities Act. It made no reference to that nationality, that nationhood that we 4/5
1572 2018-01-10 21:22:35 Believe me sunshine, if SNP Scottish Government (or probably even previous Labour Lib Dem Scottish Exec) had had control of our oil riches they wouldn’t have squandered them on tax cuts for billionaire Tory donors while Scotland’s children go hungry.
1573 2018-01-10 21:22:09 #EIA forecasts mostly flat crude oil prices and increasing production in 2018 and 2019

Oil Source
1575 2018-01-10 21:21:51 was this tweet put out by the oil industry.

BETTER:  Uruguay has 95% 

Uruguay:  renewables provide 94.5% of the country’s electricity.

In less than 10 years the country has slashed its carbon footprint and lowered electricity costs, without government subsidies.
1576 2018-01-10 21:21:48 There's a lot of things that we don't need to other sufficient way since we're not launching specific vehicles that need to oil in the tractor that carries them to the pad. Or 36B. We need to find solutions to keeping our Earth healthy and not making it harder to live
1577 2018-01-10 21:21:39 @chicagotribune How can we follow the details of the lawsuit NY is bringing against the 5 oil companies?
1578 2018-01-10 21:21:23 Noteworthy:  New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Wednesday his administration had filed a lawsuit against five major oil companies and was pushing New York City pension funds to divest from fossil fuel, both part of an effort to fight climate change.
1579 2018-01-10 21:21:23 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪
1580 2018-01-10 21:20:55 i got hot pepper oil in my nose 
1581 2018-01-10 21:20:53 I keep coconut oil in a zip lock bag in my gym bag & everytime somebody see it they double take lmaoooo, niggas think I’m off the booger sugar.
1582 2018-01-10 21:20:47 So #TrustMeImADoctor study suggests that Coconut Oil reduces LDL ('bad') cholesterol, and increases HDL ('good') cholesterol, more than olive oil.

More needs to be studied on sat fats before conclusions can be drawn, but it's v v interesting. 
1583 2018-01-10 21:20:40 But next year you will cut back on it and drill for oil.
1584 2018-01-10 21:20:31 Also, never trust a brownie recipe that substitutes butter for oil -- unless you are trying to be "healthy", but 2 cups of white sugar is far from that!
1585 2018-01-10 21:20:25 That is absolutely rediculous. The oil companies should stop supplying their products to NYC for a week to show them what it is like to live without fossil fuels.
1586 2018-01-10 21:20:20 When my brother was 5 he came home with fossils
Family thought they were wee car wheels
They were crinoids
Now my brother is a world class Geologist/PetroGeologist/Directional Driller/WellheadEngineer/Co Man & goes all over the world to tell Oil Co's where and how to drill
1587 2018-01-10 21:20:20 Oh , just f**k , they have billions $$ to fix their own dirty oil pipes , not the American taxpayers 
1588 2018-01-10 21:20:14 This is a misrepresentation of the facts

1) Since the UK joined the EU and accepted the CFP, the SNP has consistently criticised the policy and demanded change 
2) coz Scottish agriculture and fishing is vital to the Scottish economy, making up 6% of our GDP (oil & gas is 7%)
>>
1589 2018-01-10 21:20:12 NB If marine oil spill response & compensation costs exceed c. $1.5 billion, Canadian taxpayers would be on the hook, rather than the polluter.
1590 2018-01-10 21:19:52 You are nuts. Do you know how to read? Did you misunderstand his comments? He is against expanding ocean oil drilling. Period. Of course he’s worried about spills.
1591 2018-01-10 21:19:50 حتى وهما غلطانين فيها ردت بأدب 
1592 2018-01-10 21:19:46 Fav oils are definitely Tea Tree & Olive Oil & a dash of JBCO 
1593 2018-01-10 21:19:45 Oil pan and tranny pan just broke completely leaked every thing all over the floor feeling depressed
1594 2018-01-10 21:19:41 What good are oil platforms if the State of California blocks oil pipelines crossing the the state?
1595 2018-01-10 21:19:36 Trump - a complete embarrassment. Here is Trump: Hillary bad, no collusion, no collusion, i won electoral college, hard to do that; israel has walls, all troubles gone; Obama weak; Hillary is not for oil, for windmills; no collusion, no collusion, I am smart; Norway has water.
1596 2018-01-10 21:19:26 He doesn’t want any oil spills on the beaches of Mar-largo,but if an oil spill happens off coast of South Carolina or Georgia it will eventually end up in Mar-largo,but he’s not that smart 2 figure that out,so he says screw the other red states,he doesn’t have a golf course there

1601 2018-01-10 21:18:32 Annual maintenance cost is about $30k. $20k of that going to one oil change. You have to basically disassemble half the engine to change the oil. That's why the price is so high.

1604 2018-01-10 21:18:26 Yeah, that's what I came here to say. 
How about we make it legal for foreign governments to invest in political campaigns (I mean, legal for countries besides Israel). Might level the playing field while we otherwise get transnational oil & arms companies dictating our policy.
1605 2018-01-10 21:18:24 Our prices closely track the crude oil price, we pass on reductions as quickly as we can, and shield our customers from dramatic price increases. Regards - Peter 3/3

1617 2018-01-10 21:17:34 tumblr is already fading, twitter is not profitiable but Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple have reached critical mass where if one area fades they can invest massively in another. The only way they will get smaller is through government intervention a la Standard Oil

1622 2018-01-10 21:17:12 That just shows trump is terrible with money, he's been bankrupt a few times, so your point is?
Remember how trump has orchestrated oil, arms and tax deals to feather his own nest. If you think for one moment trump gives a toss about Americans you're deluded.
1623 2018-01-10 21:17:06 Arguably oil spiking oil prices trigged the financial crisis 10 years ago.

1625 2018-01-10 21:16:37 Got any ideas on the best way to process it, for year round use? I'm thinking mincing it in oil.
1626 2018-01-10 21:16:26 And with the more than dwindling oil production from Venezuela, then PETROCARIBE could be experiencing its final years, if this situation keeps going on, with an important geopolitical space for the U.S. to fill but also with China and Russia to rival it in the Caribbean basin.

1636 2018-01-10 21:15:33 There're actually human beings with brains (supposedly) who think Blasio's lawsuit against the oil companies is a "game-changer" and something more than a mere public relations stunt.

My god, people are gullible.
1637 2018-01-10 21:15:30 Today multiculturalism is like mixing oil and water, NO matter how bloody well we mix it up or shake it, it will still separate.
1638 2018-01-10 21:15:23 I guess this means those oil companies proving climate change isn't caused by human activity. In which case this might just be a political attack, rather than anything to do with monetary compensation.
1639 2018-01-10 21:15:21 @AlvaroMorata @ChelseaFC that reminds me I've not had chips in a while, can you recommend where I can get some decent oil..

@Arsenal
1640 2018-01-10 21:15:14 You are no protector of any of our environment.There should be no off shore drilling anywhere. Removing Fl. Only shows your hypocrisy.Both coastlines should be oil free. You take orders from big oil & gas.Unpatriotic, UnAmerican.This is a criminal enterprise disguised as admin .
1641 2018-01-10 21:15:11 No problem! You can also mix it will raw sugar sea salt coconut oil to make a really strong face scrub of body scrub
1642 2018-01-10 21:14:56 I agree. 2nd stages, while near same look/name, felt like new levels. You could slap a new name on those and probably wouldn't notice (Like Chem Act 2 being "Mad Science Zone" for example.) Music/Design was phenomenal for Act 2s. (Would have taken any zone besides Oil Ocean btw.)
1643 2018-01-10 21:14:56 Also, why isn't @LindseyGrahamSC  speaking out on off-shore drilling? He represents a state that could be gravely impacted by a drilling disaster. Imagine the beaches of Myrtle Beach being shut down for a vacation season due to oil spillage.
1644 2018-01-10 21:14:55 Made dinner and Andrew wants to go to my parents to change his oil. Surprise! Brought dinner!
1645 2018-01-10 21:14:55 This is co cool!! Thank you!!
1646 2018-01-10 21:14:55 "not to overstate the case, but I actually think this could change
the world." @NaomiAKlein on Mayor de Blasio of NYC announcing a lawsuit against 5 oil majors for climate damages AND fossil fuel divestment.
1647 2018-01-10 21:14:50 Me: **goes to get oil changed, tries not to make it blatantly obvious I know nothing about cars**

“Ma’am can you please release your hood”

Me: **pops trunk**
1648 2018-01-10 21:14:38 @NYCMayor Sueing Oil Companies just when the economy starts getting good again! Someone is going to sue you! Your an IDIOT!!!!
1649 2018-01-10 21:14:36 If not for coal, we'd have no trees left, if not for oil we'd have the sooty air I recall as a kid. Technology has made oil/distillates use cleaner than ever imagined. It will still be a factor in 75-100 yrs.
1650 2018-01-10 21:14:36 With the way he flipped out over wind turbines in view of his golf course in Scotland can you imagine an oil rig? 
1651 2018-01-10 21:14:35 How about whale oil? Candles? Think of the jobs they would create!
1652 2018-01-10 21:14:32 "all I got here is a basket full of oil rags and guesses" (thanks to @raisinland)

1656 2018-01-10 21:13:41 All about the oil 
1657 2018-01-10 21:13:28 really excited to be getting an oil change with a relatively new car bc now i dont have to worry about them telling me how i need $1000+ worth of repairs
1658 2018-01-10 21:13:28 Every state depends on coastal tourism so take them all off the table for offshore oil you oil company shill
1659 2018-01-10 21:13:20 I’ve always maintained that the people are the greatest assets or resources of any country. Not Oil or Gold. In our part of the world everything works against the people. From the Govt to the Police not to mention traffic and roads. Life expectancy keeps dwindling.
1660 2018-01-10 21:13:20 Coco got her oil changed, got washed and a full tank of gas today #Spoiled
1661 2018-01-10 21:13:19 How, since livin cattle while deliver methane, this methane comes from their food, and food comes from plants that take CO2 from the air, or plants are feed on Oil ?

1664 2018-01-10 21:13:07 I had to put some blessed oil on my lips  They be so dryyyy
1665 2018-01-10 21:13:05 And do you know how fast the cycles change? Really slow (it's in the tens of thousands buddy)
Yet our climate has been warming up more than EVER in recorded history. And that started happening in... ding ding ding! 1800's and afterwars! You know what we started using? Oil. Gas.
1666 2018-01-10 21:13:02 1901: U.S. - a drilling rig at Spindletop Hill near Beaumont, Tx, produced a huge gusher of crude oil ~ start of the U.S. oil industry.
1667 2018-01-10 21:12:56 @USAmbIsrael We all desperately want an end to killings. This is only likely when there is a dignified and fair peace. You could help by working to bring the sides together - using partisan vocabulary may make you popular in Israel but it is just pouring oil onto flames
1668 2018-01-10 21:12:53 Just learned how to change the oil in a vehicle. Pretty proud of myself
1669 2018-01-10 21:12:50 Excellent work! Every country has the right to be #EnergyIndependent. The #Climatards hate this independence; they love the Saudi and OPEC blood-soaked oil because it's #NIMBY (not in my back yard). Out of sight; out of mind. A typical simpleton short-sighted outlook.
1670 2018-01-10 21:12:47 Some thoughts on Venezuela and PETROCARIBE after recent geopolitical and political and energy news in the Caribbean basin: #guyana might be the next contender of Venezuela after important finding by EXXON, #cuba might well not be needing venezuelan #oil anymore, also venezuelan..
1671 2018-01-10 21:12:37 It begs the question, just who is Donald Trump's constituency for this? Exxon? 
Does he have money invested in companies that do deep Sea oil drilling? We may never know. But we know this is dangerous and very unwise.
1672 2018-01-10 21:12:32 peppermint oil was a life savor for me!! it might help
1673 2018-01-10 21:12:29 so my teacher told the class that they brought titanium white oil paint, gesso, and damar crystals for the class.... after I bought a pound of damar crystals and two tubes of titanium white

guess i'll die
1674 2018-01-10 21:12:27 I know this will fall on deaf ears. Because greenies give you so much money. How about you make sure the oil companies follow safe driving practices
1675 2018-01-10 21:12:12 hydro revenues were treated the same as Alberta’s oil revenues under the rules then Quebec would be knocked for those revenues but they are not. Alberta is knocked for oil revenues. Another flaw in the system that greatly benefits Quebec.
1676 2018-01-10 21:12:07 7-Eleven Today I said this word and I even said genius, it was like oil on water, because anyone who uses any of he PRES Phrases is now apart of his regime , CAN WE LIKEN THIS TO ANOTHER DAY?
1677 2018-01-10 21:12:07 Trump doesn't mind BP neurotoxin Corexit  in Gulf of Mexico, oil spills, poisoning of marine mammals, fishes. He & Zinke, Pruitt, Perry work for offshore drilling on Atlantic & Pacific coasts, the Gulf and Alaska... but made an exception for Mar A Lago's Florida.
1678 2018-01-10 21:11:52 @algore "megawatt/hour!  Not possible.  This is a scam.  kilowatt/hour more likely but oil, coal and gas do it for 2 cents per Kw/hr.

1683 2018-01-10 21:11:42 Come on - Trump didn’t like windmills near his Scotland course.  You think he wants oil rigs anywhere near his places in FL??  Talk about rigged
1684 2018-01-10 21:11:27 Rosemary oil 
1685 2018-01-10 21:11:24 Thank you. Not tried sudocrem but will give it a go. I have an omega 3 oil to put on my dinner, grain free too. Mums read about other oils too like coconut and hemp. Will see if anything works and report back.
1686 2018-01-10 21:11:20 Wearing pachouli oil to work should be considered low level terrorism
1687 2018-01-10 21:11:17 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
1688 2018-01-10 21:11:16 The Edmonton Oil Kings send Davis Koch and a conditional third round pick in the 2019 Bantam Draft to the Vancouver Giants for Brendan Semchuk, Todd Scott and a third round pick in the 2018 draft. #yql
1689 2018-01-10 21:11:14 Becoming a moving experience, I read a novel and see an oil rig sobbing on top of the Pyramids
1690 2018-01-10 21:11:14 OIL DIFF: 5.84 -> 5.9
1691 2018-01-10 21:11:02 Exactly - Keeping big oil off the coast is a constant battle we can't turn away from for one minute.
1692 2018-01-10 21:11:02 That combined with access panels and awkward positioning.  Couldn't get any of my filter wrenches on it.

Would be a different story if I had a pit or lift and an extra set of hands

IOW, Ford wants you to bring it to the dealership for a $80 oil change.
1693 2018-01-10 21:10:56 I dropped my car off at 1:30 for an oil change....why aren’t they finished.
1694 2018-01-10 21:10:51 Yeah makes total sense,  divest from oil companies that aren't in NY but don't give a shit about NYC being powered by fracked gas power plants in Hudson Valley. Why not stop CPV, CVE and Millennium? No one cares NY is adding 25% GHG emissions? No one stopping 2,000MW power plants
1695 2018-01-10 21:10:49 Always knew #CoconutOil is good for my health - I eat the whole nut and use the oil for cooking, hair, skin etc. all my life. Good to see @BBC programme -Trust me I’m a doctor - give attention to the health benefits of  #CoconutOil  & Alain- on TV #Proud @doctoralaing
1696 2018-01-10 21:10:47 Where I live the household waste are being burned and the energy from that being used to heat homes and possibly generate electricity. But still the recycling of plastics would be very useful as it saves on the oil budget.
1697 2018-01-10 21:10:44 Ridiculous-Charlatan-In-Chief. Selling snake oil to the very people you're screwing over.  And some of them love it.  Amazing.
1698 2018-01-10 21:10:42 I have tremendous respect for people who have a particular view and then live true to their beliefs. So when I see someone badmouth oil companies get on a bike and ride away, I’m like “what a great person.”
1699 2018-01-10 21:10:35 Thing is, the U.S. really does not need MORE oil.
1700 2018-01-10 21:10:31 OPEC has just raised oil to over $102/Barrel. And @realdonaldtrump still won't approve the Keystone Pipeline. Does he want high gas prices?
1701 2018-01-10 21:10:30 ＢＢの変装は本当にすごいぜ！やっぱベテランだけあるよなー！
1702 2018-01-10 21:10:29 So Putin's ROI is bad. These lg phishing, hacking, trolling, $ corruption and compromising efforts, contribute to a degradation of democracy. You haven't noticed anti-news, off-shore kleptocracy & oligarchy trends? the Paris accords and other oil & gas states/industry policies?

1707 2018-01-10 21:09:39 Guys it’s ok! Mayo =eggs and oil. You favorite baker probably does this and you don’t even know 
1708 2018-01-10 21:09:25 Just been watching #TrustMeImADoctor and glad to see that my suspicions are right. Coconut oil is good for skin , shite for the heart. Anyone who tells you to eat it may as well tell you to smoke a ciggie
1709 2018-01-10 21:09:09 Palm oil plantations should be ILLEGAL if if means  Elephants being killed
1710 2018-01-10 21:08:44 Yes the shells/husks can be pressed to make all sorts of things! Think how popular coconut oil is now, what happens to all those shells?!  #organichour
1711 2018-01-10 21:08:39 Please, please someone in NY. Declare Trump Tower an eyesore and tear it down. Or better yet. Claim there is oil under it and sell the rights to the tunnels underneath. Drill Baby Drill
1712 2018-01-10 21:08:38 Yeah it's a good move for the Oil. I'm not sold on Bilous. So in the end it works. Semchuck is a good fit for their system too.
1713 2018-01-10 21:08:33 The verdict is out on coconut oil. Please read the research.

1716 2018-01-10 21:08:31 What? Immigrants are gonna use oil/gas pipelines and elextric grid to bypass the wall? 
1717 2018-01-10 21:08:28 I keep thinking about oil, world powers, armies depending on oil, reserves, alliances. shifting paradigms, and, the occasional surprise.
1718 2018-01-10 21:08:27 As they say in the west Texas oil fields, "when the boss is looking, walk quickly and carry something heavy."

1726 2018-01-10 21:07:33 I had a stud for like 6 months then a hoop for like 2 but I was doing so much with it. I had one of those annoying bumps and was doing an aspirin paste and occasion jojoba oil. I was so over it.

1735 2018-01-10 21:06:42 @realDonaldTrump  You already let it happen starting with the pipeline oil spills in South Dakota. Now you want the same mess through the bread basket heartland where earthquakes will destroy our fresh water aquafers, that would RUIN the world's food supply.  Nice Legacy Donnie.
1736 2018-01-10 21:06:28 The place where I got my truck, they change my oil for free.

1737 2018-01-10 21:06:19 Humorous. Sue the companies, settle out of court, they jack up oil prices, public costs skyrocket, taxes hiked, people leave NYC. Problem solved. Now they can get back to riding bikes on mud roads & growing mushrooms.
1738 2018-01-10 21:06:15 i think i’m burning oil :-(

1743 2018-01-10 21:05:53 We pay less in hydro, you pay less for gas and oil so I assume it all works out in the end, but I would not attempt to comment on something I really don’t know anything about, I still find my hydro bill high but not compared to some friends in Ontario. How much you paying for gas
1744 2018-01-10 21:05:50 When it's 2050 and cheese has supplanted oil, coffee, and cosmetics in the World economy...boy are you going to feel silly.

1750 2018-01-10 21:05:27 Narrator: Oil and gas fuel civilization -- even in California. Texas deals with off shore oil platforms quite nicely,.
1751 2018-01-10 21:05:20 Anytime. If only we *were* oil independent, but it's a long way.
1752 2018-01-10 21:05:09 I hope the oil companies say "fine" and just stop selling petroleum to NYC.

"Will de Blasio's transit policy match his investment policy?"

1761 2018-01-10 21:04:29 We are very diversified now with oil on a down we still have record low unemployment
1762 2018-01-10 21:04:26 Between 2005 & 2010, Quebec received $42.4-billion in equalization. Lost revenues resulting from excessively low electricity pricing during that period was $28.6-billion. If hydro was treated the same as Alberta’s oil that 28.6 billion would be deducted from equalization payments
1763 2018-01-10 21:04:20 You didn't really think he'd allow oil rigs within sight of Mar a Lago, did you?
1764 2018-01-10 21:04:07 @JustinTrudeau NORWAY ...1 TRILLION DOLLAR OIL CITIZEN FUND ...THATS A COUNTRY FOR THE PEOPLE  ...where's OURS ?
1765 2018-01-10 21:04:06 Thank you. Our land and seascape attract people from all over the world. Oil rigs would ruin our land/seascapes, attracting fewer tourists. It’s an economic cost.

1768 2018-01-10 21:03:47 Why do these programmes always look at brands and not also ways of making your own lotions & testing those too?

I use coconut oil, Vit A & Evening Primrose oil with drops of lavender & rose oil for moisturising my face. A pot lasts for ages too! #thetruthaboutlookinggood
1769 2018-01-10 21:03:42 Everyone who uses fossil fuels should be rounded up and locked up before they kill us all!  They're causing hurricanes and cold snaps and whatnot!

Force them to work building hydroelectric dams or harvesting cooking oil or something before it's too late.
1770 2018-01-10 21:03:41 Not only that but they've built up a national oil fund worth over 1 trillion.
1771 2018-01-10 21:03:35 we really havent. Outside of dominating winter sports and getting rich off of oil, we are a boring country with gorgeous nature and impolite people7

1780 2018-01-10 21:03:18 I'm not a fan of this.

I like oil and advanced fracking natural gas.
1781 2018-01-10 21:03:17 Coconut oil is proof of gods existence
1782 2018-01-10 21:03:05 Just took a quick look at your meme and thought I'd let you know that the keystone pipeline has leaked over 200,000 gallons of oil in South Dakota. Hell of an accomplishment he shoved through, without researching it at all.

1785 2018-01-10 21:02:56 New York City is suing five major oil companies, claiming they have contributed to global warming.
The defendants in the city's federal lawsuit are BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell.
1786 2018-01-10 21:02:55 That's what happens when you steal someones heart. Well.. before all the oil & pupils roll up.
1787 2018-01-10 21:02:45 That's hilarious
I have people tell me all the time that they "Have an oil for that problem". #DefinitelyYesOnAllOfYourQuestions
1788 2018-01-10 21:02:41 Higher oil prices have a record of halting periods of strong global economic growth. Maybe the optimistic forecasts for 2018 are a little premature.
1789 2018-01-10 21:02:27 It’s about time US becomes energy independent so as not to be held hostage by oil producing countries and other hostile actors to help lower energy costs for the American people. Way to go Mr. President. 2018 shaping up as a very good year.
1790 2018-01-10 21:02:22 Hot bath with Johnson's Baby Oil?
1791 2018-01-10 21:02:19 Must be great to shift the blame to others, but is more the damage we've done.  The oil companys just met our demand.
1792 2018-01-10 21:02:15 NORWAY ...1 TRILLION DOLLAR OIL CITIZEN FUND ...THATS A COUNTRY FOR THE PEOPLE
1793 2018-01-10 21:02:13 Watching @JOYNEWSONTV.
Ghana has the worst primary schools in the world.

This is unimaginably bad for a country with gold and oil. 56 schools look like abandoned cow sheds.
1794 2018-01-10 21:01:59 Add oil yl hahahaha
1795 2018-01-10 21:01:57 Thank god there wasn’t anything wrong they forgot to reset it when they changed my oil
1796 2018-01-10 21:01:49 Shea butter ..raw black natural soap , coconut oil ...almond oil , lavender oil 
1797 2018-01-10 21:01:47 $BBPPQ huge buying came in EOD court tomorrow in favor of shareholders?? Very possible assets worth 3x now with oil above $60 , if equity in favor of shareholders preferred will see $10++
1798 2018-01-10 21:01:45 It’s not oil
1799 2018-01-10 21:01:43 Just transition to 100% renewable energy for everyone. No new coal, oil or gas projects anywhere.
1800 2018-01-10 21:01:42 Little heads up.  He opened up a little bit of space for drilling oil and gas too  didn’t want another big friggen surprise to make your heads explode
1801 2018-01-10 21:01:39 Okay! Thank you! I already cook everything in coconut oil so that I won’t have to change. And okay I love that list you sent!
1802 2018-01-10 21:01:38 They've struck oil in Dingle!
1803 2018-01-10 21:01:32 They let you shower in prison still?!? I thought you had shower privileges revoked after what happened last year when you covered the shower room with canola oil, started a naked haka, and challenged every prisoner and guard to fight...
1804 2018-01-10 21:01:26 I made a chicken stew, I didn't add any oil or anything but I kept the skins on. I didn't eat them but I feel awful :(
1805 2018-01-10 21:01:19 I am elated! The big companies Including oil companies got a big tax brake; gas is going up. Someone explain that please!
1806 2018-01-10 21:01:13 Why? Because it would have meant the end of unionism as a political force in Scotland! Look, independence is my first priority, but I'm an experienced political strategist, independent and impartial. I'm giving you the good oil here. I called for everybody to vote SNP in WM...
1807 2018-01-10 21:01:10 Actually, isn't cold-pressed coconut oil good for you?
1808 2018-01-10 21:01:07 dont mind seeing my bio and physics grades but boy my chemistry grade need holy oil

1810 2018-01-10 21:00:58 Good!! If VA fights for it and wins, it will give NC DEMS the power to fight for NC. Both NC and VA would both be ruined with oil rigs off the coast.
1811 2018-01-10 21:00:58 have you tried coconut oil on your audio interface though?
1812 2018-01-10 21:00:53 By exempting Florida because of the threat to tourism, @SecretaryZinke acknowedges the danger oil drilling poses for all states. Duplicity.

1816 2018-01-10 21:00:32 Global warming is caused primarily by putting too much CO2 into the atmosphere- again, shit WE do everyday- animal agriculture, burning coal/oil/natural gases rather than cleaner sources of energy(air, solar, etc)
1817 2018-01-10 21:00:32 I would love rub it with some oil
1818 2018-01-10 21:00:32 How does atomising oil affect taste? I get how it reduces calories but not flavour.
1819 2018-01-10 21:00:23 Stop by and see us for your oil change. $8 Off.
1820 2018-01-10 21:00:21 Norway did it RIGHT ....my country CANADA ..squandered its wealth to the big AMERICAN OIL FIRMS ....BLAME is on CANADA'S POLITICIANS

There have been protests against Chinese oil projects.
1822 2018-01-10 21:00:20 Apply jojoba oil for 20 minutes before going to the shower. This promotes fast hair growth!
1823 2018-01-10 21:00:10 The 5ms latency of my audio interface is no match for the speed in which someone will respond recommending coconut oil if you mention literally any physical ailment on social media.
1824 2018-01-10 21:00:09 Ok im pouring oil on the mustang seats 
1825 2018-01-10 21:00:00 the question of the moment was "is coconut oil good for you?" not a scientist or MD so I googled and posted something from an apparent quack that said yes.
1826 2018-01-10 21:00:00 I was bored last night so I wrote an article on the history of oil wrestling in the Ottoman Empire. Here's comes the first blog of 2018 
1827 2018-01-10 20:59:54 Last I looked oil is not a nationalized industry so states and not the feds should decide if they want offshore drilling. Exempting FL because of tourism applies to every east and west coast state. Zinke and Trump just screwed up, again! #offshoredrilling #Zinke

1829 2018-01-10 20:59:42 This is your party - this is what years of Fox News, Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck et al have done to your base. They have been conditioned to ignore facts as reported by professional news gatherers & now adhere only to a bunch of carnival barkers who sell them snake oil.

1834 2018-01-10 20:59:12 I just sit the bar in the water for about 20 mins. Take out bar and cool solution. Dissolve some #essentialoils in vodka (as mixing them in the usual base oil would mean it wouldn't mix well into the salt solution) and add to salt solution. Pour into spray bottle...
1835 2018-01-10 20:59:05 And to sell off our National Monuments got gas oil & mining isawful
1836 2018-01-10 20:59:04 She has what they call a Canadian tolerance.  It seems to get bigger in the winter time and around OIL inventory reports.
1837 2018-01-10 20:59:00 Sorry, hard to take anyone seriously who doesn't seriously curtail their air travel limiting it to only essential trips. Climate scientists do, so surely states who are suing the oil companies who refine their jet fuel should do so as well.
1838 2018-01-10 20:58:40 I don’t either but I’ve been using witchhazel with drops of tea tree oil and sleeping with aloe Vera on my face it helped
1839 2018-01-10 20:58:29 Some people get away with using just coconut oil or just a slice of lemon. #OrganicHour

1849 2018-01-10 20:57:35 Such a blessing to have a friend who will change oil and tune up car w/o me having to worry about getting ripped off or things breaking. And in exchange I babysit. Great deal!
1850 2018-01-10 20:57:34 I've heard the same sort of talk from employees of local oil and electric companies.

1858 2018-01-10 20:56:23 The real idiocy of Bullard's comment is that he's basically rooting for higher oil prices. He should walk into a Walmart and tell people that's what he wants.

1860 2018-01-10 20:56:03 I use Joico Kpak , aquage oil, and pistachio oil. My hair is just so so so dehydrated ! It’s terrible. It comes from me not drinking nearly enough water
1861 2018-01-10 20:55:59 With @jeffsessions suggesting he'll crack down on weed industry and @realDonaldTrump letting oil rigs set up offshore @LAOEconTax @california are going to be screwed
1862 2018-01-10 20:55:57 Yes. The athletes are not the employees here, they’re the oil.
1863 2018-01-10 20:55:57 Last time they made a trade with the oil kings it worked out ok... might have worked out better if not for the injury bug!

1865 2018-01-10 20:55:55 @CarinesMoncada Esto de bitcoins es el nuevo “snake oil” de los años 1880
1866 2018-01-10 20:55:42 Yes! Thank you @NYCMayor for divesting NYC’s pension funds from big oil & gas companies, AND for the city suing the biggest fossil fuel corporations for the #climate damage they’ve caused.
1867 2018-01-10 20:55:33 NY permits fracking infrastructure, so this rings hollow for those of us who have to fight pipelines & compressor stations & bomb trains to not be built/present in our neighborhoods. The Port of Albany ships all kinds of oil & gas.
1868 2018-01-10 20:55:31 I love making home made BBQ chicken shawarma. Need chicken tenders, garlic, lemon, olive oil, salt, pepper, cumin, paprika, turmeric, and curry powder. Marinate the chicken for 24hrs or more and toss on the grill. Way better than some deep fried chick-fillet fat-fast food.

1871 2018-01-10 20:55:28 #CoronationStreet did they start banging that oil drum and chanting?   
1872 2018-01-10 20:55:27 And oil. 
And water.
But mostly the oil.
1873 2018-01-10 20:55:21 i use the moisturiser and the rose hip oil and two more oils/masks, im not sure what the name of them isill sent you pictures when im home!
1874 2018-01-10 20:55:20 Me either. If the oil is on the floor of the Gulf, then the bottom feeders are eating it, the predators are eating them, and humans are then eating them. -- Not only making humans sick, but hurting the entire chain of animals.
1875 2018-01-10 20:55:15 Perhaps he means he needs castor oil.
1876 2018-01-10 20:55:12 Bill, you should ban all oil and oil based products from NYC!!!! PLEASE SAVE THE PLANET!!!

1879 2018-01-10 20:55:03 The last time I honestly paid for an oil change it was $30 only because I let someone talk me into some extra shit
1880 2018-01-10 20:55:00 Rap it up ! Pop some cod liver oil on those joints
1881 2018-01-10 20:54:57 Talk to me like I'm stupid: 

Doesn't any state/jurisdiction have the ability to zone away the infrastructure need to supply offshore oil wells?
1882 2018-01-10 20:54:51 Of course it is. He doesn’t want his golf properties subjected to the sight of oil derricks and his beach front covered in sludge.
1883 2018-01-10 20:54:28 I just turned up my oil furnace.
1884 2018-01-10 20:54:26 Rap it up ! Pop some cod liver oil on those joints ....
1885 2018-01-10 20:54:15 there was only enough oil to last one night of #CES, but a miracle happened and the oil lasted eight whole nights
1886 2018-01-10 20:54:11 Oh yes! A jar of rollmops. Or a jar of artichoke hearts in olive oil and some bread. Or sardines. Beans on toast! All comforting.
1887 2018-01-10 20:54:01 today’s to do list

1888 2018-01-10 20:53:54 I feel like I'll know I've made it when I can take my car for an oil change and not get a list of extra repairs needed
1889 2018-01-10 20:53:47 C'mon! He's got a lot invested in ocean front properties; can't risk an oil spill there
1890 2018-01-10 20:53:46 Vitamins help alot and oil a mix of coconut with  Moroccan Aryan oils work for me and a diet change drinking alot more milk and eating more almonds and seafood
1891 2018-01-10 20:53:45 oh I hope there is a vid. Your mammoth tits and baby oil OMG
1892 2018-01-10 20:53:43 Hey have great hydroelectric power, I want to see more of that in the future, but I'm an oil man and Hillary was for windmills! Bahaha haha! He makes a fool of himself Everytime!
1893 2018-01-10 20:53:42 Please stop selling gas and any other oil products in NYC if they’re going to be suing your company. @NYCMayorsOffice
1894 2018-01-10 20:53:37 Dear God, Msss Feinstein, don't your Californians PAY MORE than any of the lower 48 states for gasoline? Don't YOU want Californians to get those high paying jobs drilling for oil & gas? YOUR CONSTITUENTS WANT TO KNOW, Msss Feinstein
1895 2018-01-10 20:53:33 because not all of us can afford to smear olive oil all over our screens to achieve the same effect
1896 2018-01-10 20:53:32 Singapore's SWF versus Saudi is interesting -- zero natural resources versus tons.
I started out as an oil reporter, covered OPEC etc. Save for Norway (which came to the money late) every oil economy - Indonesia, Nigeria, Saudi, Texas, Venezuela - is cursed.
1897 2018-01-10 20:53:32 This man just told me my oil change gone be $50 
1898 2018-01-10 20:53:24 if you argue that repealing #netneutrality/other regs is going to (a) encourage more rural broadband buildout or (b) lower internet bills, I have some snake oil to sell you.
1899 2018-01-10 20:53:23 Washington State moving towards a carbon tax, New York City divesting from fossil fuels and suing oil majors. It ain't all bad.
1900 2018-01-10 20:53:21 i scheduled my oil change online and they sent me an email and text confirmation and then called me. i did it online so i WOULDN’T have to talk on the phone 
1901 2018-01-10 20:53:19 Exactly!! Plus, we have no idea how long it will affect the reproductive rates for animals in the area. I'm so sick of big oil.
1902 2018-01-10 20:53:18 Now let's get into stroke continued; prevention sugar (candy) = healthy glucose consistency; salt of pillar, lemonade, Olive oil in sweats of blood...
1903 2018-01-10 20:53:09 Baby oil! Haha
1904 2018-01-10 20:53:02 Si algun dia viajo a Corea lo primero que voy hacer es tomar soju esa bebida me esta llamando
1905 2018-01-10 20:52:57 Getting an oil change in the Italian community means you gossip, practice your flirting, eat some snack, coffee and then maybe, if there’s time, fix the car.
1906 2018-01-10 20:52:55 Not nearly enough oil to do that, especially with new tax cuts. There's a consequence to everything.
1907 2018-01-10 20:52:48 Spain will not veto it 90% of its seafood and 100% of its oil and gas come from Scottish waters,I actually live in Catalonia and let me assure you it s completely different and Spain will not veto anything
1908 2018-01-10 20:52:47 ELN's 1500 guerrilla fighters have been bombing the Cano Limon - Caribbean shore pipeline once a week, causing severe financial damage to Colombia's Oil industry. USA & Colombia must hit them hard to force ELN into Peace, surrendering or be destroyed
1909 2018-01-10 20:52:42 طب هو فيه الاتنين قولي بقي يا دكتور عاصم هتكشف ازاي ، هتكشف بال volatile oil ولا بال tannins !؟ ابهرني
1910 2018-01-10 20:52:39 didn't he also do one of pouring hot oil on his junk?
1911 2018-01-10 20:52:36 Whale oil beef hooked (say it fast) Thanks for following an farmer's son from Iceland. Red or dead @AbdoulThiam
1912 2018-01-10 20:52:27 Then the border of the park is reduced to allows drilling for oil.Dummy.
1913 2018-01-10 20:52:13 So I decided to be adventurous today and blow dry my hair. I haven't applied heat to my hair in over a year. I slather some coconut oil in it before the process...and now my hair smells like straight up vomit. Legit barf.
1914 2018-01-10 20:52:02 If only he had someone in his administration who could explain the connection between U.S. oil companies and Russia...
1915 2018-01-10 20:51:55 Remember that 9-cent-a-barrel US tax on oil that was set aside for cleanups? Our new tax "reform" cut it to zero.
1916 2018-01-10 20:51:52 Well I think it’s safe to say the “new” (preexisting) libel laws will not apply to him kind of like his whole “offshore oil drilling will move forward” just not for Repub. run states. #InvestigateGOP #ImpeachTrump
1917 2018-01-10 20:51:48 Stop selling gas and any other oil products in NYC. Screw them.

1919 2018-01-10 20:51:31 I've heard of staff using role play e.g. pretending to be a car and "having an oil leak" when it's time for the toilet #SENexchange

1921 2018-01-10 20:51:26 Shordy want them Free oil changes 
1922 2018-01-10 20:51:25 To tell the truth.  The climate is always changing. Is it man made. The verdict is out. Here is another fact. The usa cannot produce enough electricity to keep up. Energy efficiency is a good thing. The oil is running out. So there you go.
1923 2018-01-10 20:51:22 The moisturizing properties. Gotta love gold bond and coconut oil!! #tinselvoxbox

1926 2018-01-10 20:51:12 Ok, Twitter. Please take a collective Deep Breath & Don't Panic. I have the ultimate #MiddleClassCrisis happening right here, right now. I have run out of olive oil. I repeat. I am out of olive oil. This hasn't happened to me since 1986. #WeHaveCalamity
1927 2018-01-10 20:51:11 My major issue with the new SC is it looks like everyone is covered in baby oil most of the time

1929 2018-01-10 20:51:02 Great - Now get with the Gov and make a BIG public statement to Zinke about oil Drilling
1930 2018-01-10 20:50:53 I need a hot oil back rub and some dome 
1931 2018-01-10 20:50:53 Hrm. I know we already talked about it, but maybe Tea Tree oil might help? I hear that stuff is pretty good at healing. Helps numb and good for the skin too.
1932 2018-01-10 20:50:51 Sue the fuck out of oil companies. Make them pay reparations.
1933 2018-01-10 20:50:51 Everyone knows you use garlic on vampires, but for ghosts, I'd recommend a bit of olive oil, salt, ground pepper, and dash of fresh thyme. Place on a baking sheet and put in a 350° oven for 15 minutes. Flip once, add oil as needed, and bake for another 10 minutes.
1934 2018-01-10 20:50:47 The biggest card the SNP have to play is independence and return to Europe after Brexit, and a promise to abstain in return for e.g powers or oil revenue is a good negotiating tool.

1935 2018-01-10 20:50:46 What about the dignity people who work on oil rigs get?  They want to be productive citizens instead of being drain on society

1938 2018-01-10 20:50:37 that’s what they call it when it’s got too much oil to legally be classified as cheese anymore :9
1939 2018-01-10 20:50:35 I was considering that, tbh! I have some aveda stress fix aromatherapy oil and I’m kinda thinking I’ll dig it out

1948 2018-01-10 20:49:27 I put lavender essential oil in EVERYTHING because I am a cliche. Genuinely, putting it into my nighttime face cream has been lovely. I've noticed a marked difference in how quickly and easily I sleep after starting it.
1949 2018-01-10 20:49:24 Must admit I did it on purpose once  guy was getting irate so I decided to check my oil and washers!! 
1950 2018-01-10 20:49:22 We don’t need more oil drilling and the byproducts, or “externalities,” as oil companies call them, do kill people.
1951 2018-01-10 20:49:16 Bet it has a wall.
1952 2018-01-10 20:49:02 It’s so good and I use it every wednesday night. Also rose hip oil is full of vitamin A and C (good for anti aging/cell turnover and brightening) and antioxidants and maybe i’ve recommended it before but get some!! again recommend the ordinary for this shit, they’re so affordable
1953 2018-01-10 20:49:02 @marcrileydj would like to send you some Banana Oil music (re: dude called Brian who shouted us out on your show in his review of the Freakender! festival in Glasgow last year) - what's the best way to do this?

1968 2018-01-10 20:48:01 How is hydro power better than wind power exactly? Aren't both equally better than oil and gas?  This is the stuff that makes my head hurt
1969 2018-01-10 20:47:51 I've looked up how to start a Model T and how to light a coal stove. Also how to refine crude oil into fuel. Sexy!
1970 2018-01-10 20:47:45 It's a fairly small amount of XCT Oil, so you'll still want to use close to your normal recipe.

1980 2018-01-10 20:47:11 Paul & his western caucus buddies lying, deceiving and trying to spread misinformation so they can reward their dirty oil buddies & campaign contributors at the expense of our health & safety, sea life & coastlines.  You really have no shame Paul!
1981 2018-01-10 20:47:09 He says they are: SCOTUS judge + other judges confirmed, “set a new record” reducing regulations (call the Guinness World Book!), passed “the largest tax cut in American history” (it isn’t), reopened ANWR to oil drilling, stock market “shattering one record after another.”
1982 2018-01-10 20:47:06 Infrastructure. National parks are in the US. They are being opened up for oil drilling. How many oil workers are killed on the job? Or, even better, park your car in the garage, leave it running, and close the door. What happens to you then? Would a poisonous gas kill you?
1983 2018-01-10 20:46:55 Right, it's disgraceful!  If Bill Nelson was truly concerned about saving Florida's coastline from oil spills he would be fighting against all drilling in the gulf considering the direction of the Gulf stream.
1984 2018-01-10 20:46:50 And he's for swapping the statue of liberty for an oil rig.
1985 2018-01-10 20:46:48 Ppl saying a 30 ft wall has no deterrent value  show us how stupid ppl can be.
1986 2018-01-10 20:46:47 too bad the 5 oil companies don't get together and turn off the fuel supply to New York City

1991 2018-01-10 20:46:25 I never use all the fancy creams.  I wash my face in Johnson’s baby soap and water.  I make my own moisturiser using Camellia oil and whatever essential oils I fancy.  I never wear foundation, or any other makeup, occasionally a whisper of eye liner. #thetruthaboutlookinggood
1992 2018-01-10 20:46:24 Trump - a complete embarrassment.

1993 2018-01-10 20:46:24 People pray for the cake. Then God gives them the batter, eggs, oil, icing, a pan, an oven, they get frustrated and leave the kitchen. Let that sink. Sometimes you have everything right in front of you, but how bad do you want it ?
1994 2018-01-10 20:46:20 It's cheap too! I had the rose hip oil but didn't try anything else. What do you use?
1995 2018-01-10 20:46:19 Because I want Palm oil in my chocolate instead of cocoa butter.
1996 2018-01-10 20:45:53 But hardly eat any as not a big crisp fan generally. Popcorn from bulk is my go to crunchy snack. Love it with salt and olive oil! 
1997 2018-01-10 20:45:51 Be like Norway. Oil extraction should be a public non-profit business and all profit should go to the federal govt. get rid of income taxes altogether. Fund military and natl health insurance. Oil, natural gas is a NATIONAL resource. It should done by/repaid to private venture.

2001 2018-01-10 20:45:29 Trump's opening Georgia coastline oil reserves to leasing by off-shore drilling companies will decimate Georgia's loggerhead sea turtle population, but no protest from Georgia Republican Guv and #GaGOP legislature who, like Trump, are in the pockets of big oil. #gapol #Dunwoody
2002 2018-01-10 20:45:28 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
2003 2018-01-10 20:45:27 These sound like winners, helps soak up oil, leaves it smelling good and refreshed, bouncy and manageable #TinselVoxBox #contest @InfluensterVox  sounds like everything you need in a hair product

2007 2018-01-10 20:45:11 Will California sue Mother Nature to stop releasing oil from the natural fissures on the ocean floor off the California coast ? 
2008 2018-01-10 20:45:09 He also said he is great on the environment and said he supports massive oil..??
2009 2018-01-10 20:45:03 President Trump on Paris Agreement: "We could conceivably go back in ... I feel very strongly about MAKING MONEY AT THE EXPENSE OF environment, JUST ASK MY FRIENDS WITH COMPANIES IN THE MINING, LOGGING & OIL INDUSTRIES”

2010 2018-01-10 20:45:01 While tauting that US is doing so great in oil & gas,Trump critcizes Hillary Clinton for clean energy policies like wind mills, then tells Prime Minister of Norway how great it is that most of their power comes from hydro power.
Could someone explain to him what clean energy is!!
2011 2018-01-10 20:44:57 A most lackluster, on-the-nose, and shitty attempt to try and brand appealingly brand yourself.  Cringeworthy.  We all know the snake oil you're really trying to sell.
2012 2018-01-10 20:44:53 @DrMichaelMosley Doc, VLDL is the issue, not LDL cholesterol. We all knew that Coconut oil increased HDL. It's really disappointing that you found this result surprising as there are many papers available on this subject. @FatEmperor

2017 2018-01-10 20:44:25 I think the actual response was "There was no collusion, I like big oil and a yuge military and Putin doesn't. Hillary Clinton likes windmills and hates the military. Mary had a Little Boy Blue..." yada, yada, yada.  Just about as coherent as that.
2018 2018-01-10 20:44:07 It's a giant mistake, he's actually just a fan of classic Aussie band Midnight Oil.
2019 2018-01-10 20:44:01 He better get some more of that snake oil from Mark Jackson!
2020 2018-01-10 20:43:58 I coulda changed the oil myself at this rate lol
2021 2018-01-10 20:43:45 I left a fish oil pill in my cammies chest pocket by accident when I washed it and now I smell the fish 
2022 2018-01-10 20:43:43 Of course, Trump gives into Florida to exempt them from offshore drilling. It just wouldn't be good for business at Mar-a-Lago and Trump properties to have million dollar views of oil rigs offshore and oil stained beaches. Typical NIMBY a$$hole!
2023 2018-01-10 20:43:36 Let's get rid of the greatest threat first, the GOP and Trump.  A vote for Jill now is a vote for Trump, a vote to keep the Supreme Court ultra conservative, a vote against women and minorities, a vote for big oil, and a vote to allow ultra right wing nuts to make policy and laws
2024 2018-01-10 20:43:29  was just on TV with Norway's VERY right-wing, anti-immigrant, OIL Prime Minister, Erna Solberg.  , of course, had to bring in Hillary ("Hillary was for windmills"....for no reason whatsoever, the bloody fool embarrassment). Show-off fool.....@justtish7
2025 2018-01-10 20:43:27 I deserve an olive oil hair treatment and to watch Netflix in bed all day :) Oh and let's throw a mud mask in too!

2028 2018-01-10 20:43:14 Please revisit congestion pricing. A lawsuit against big oil without supporting mass transit is hypocritical.
2029 2018-01-10 20:43:12 Is there a lot of oil off the Oregon coast? What makes you think anyone will drill there anyway? Simple incompetence, or Advanced Trump Derangement Syndrome?

2041 2018-01-10 20:42:05 I think he was trying to say, "I am formed from a massive ball of oil and gas and nothing else,"
2042 2018-01-10 20:42:02 Think of how much dirt & oil builds up on makeup brushes after each use. Wash them with a brush cleaner often.
2043 2018-01-10 20:42:01 Didn’t he just say he was all in for big oil.
2044 2018-01-10 20:41:54 dear young boy, this is what you do: Get black jamaican castor oil (eBay), and take like a spoonful and rub it into your beard at night before bed. its a super thick oil so wash it out in the morning. do that, and take biotin tablets and wham u will be the arab voldemort
2045 2018-01-10 20:41:48 Reporters ask Trump about Paris climate agreement but not upcoming decision on #IranDeal waiver of oil sanctions.
2046 2018-01-10 20:41:32 and the best part is before norway got our oil. the US was there to see if they wanna drill for some oil , but they didnt find oil, so norway got it #Muuuuuuuurica

2054 2018-01-10 20:40:53 You did one thing (taxes).  You did not do that much except weaken the EPA, Reduce safeguards for oil... etc.       You bunch are a joke
2055 2018-01-10 20:40:51 I'll believe it when those parroting walls don't work take them down around own homes and take locks off doors. Pure ignorance
2056 2018-01-10 20:40:43 Trump next to a leader from Norway with intelligence and facts at her fingertips - a complete embarrassment. Here is Trump: Hillary bad, no collusion, no collusion, Obama weak; Hillary is not for oil, she was for windmills; no collusion, no collusion, I am smart; Norway has water
2057 2018-01-10 20:40:37 Is anyone watching trump's press conference? God, he is so embarrassing. He just brought up his opponent Hillary. He wants massive oil & gas & Hillary wants windmills. Unbelievable! And then he complimented Solberg on their Hydropower & said "we need to get some of that."
2058 2018-01-10 20:40:32 We're not. #1 source of oil in the USA is the USA. #2 source is Canada.
2059 2018-01-10 20:40:30 Great picture! Wineskin making the moves on De Nero.
Harvey: Come on watch me shower, then give me a nice massage! I've got potplants....
De Nero: You talkin' to me? What kind of pot plant?
Harvey: You'll be great in my next movie. Can you use oil not talcum powder?
De Nero: Ok.

2061 2018-01-10 20:40:21 There is no oil off the Fl coast. If there was it would have been pumped during WW2.

2070 2018-01-10 20:40:01 S/o to @ChrisColston17 for taking my car to get oil changed, tires rotated, vacuumed, washed, and a full tank of gas. You da best. 
2071 2018-01-10 20:40:01 @MSNBC  he just repeated NO collusion 15- 20 times. And for the big one HE's for BIG OIL now we know all that Koch money makes him a puppet to them. He's so Guilty
2072 2018-01-10 20:39:53 But it is a start...first time I have ever heard a conservative MP actually admit that Scotland is not subsidised and the additional funds are related to Scotland's oil!!!
2073 2018-01-10 20:39:53 Bill De Blasio, sindaco di New York ha appena dichiarato che la città di New York farà causa e disinvestirà in tutte le big Oil Companies perché complici del climate change.

2076 2018-01-10 20:39:41 No. But again. Not my point. Stop looking at individuals and look at the system. The NCAA is literally OPEC only instead of oil it’s college sports.
2077 2018-01-10 20:39:35 FFS woman just stop talking abut this!  Have you never heard the phrase “when you’ve sold the snake oil just stop selling”?  We know what it means, & no tiny amount of potential savings in our CMP bills will make up for the burdens we’ll see elsewhere. We’re not that dumb.
2078 2018-01-10 20:39:32 I'm getting a pedicure. Salon has Fox News on; Trump and Norway are announcing their commitment to fight ISIS. (This is all about oil. Bet.)

Trump says, "If there's collusion, it's with the Democrats."

Oddly, my head is still unexploded.
2079 2018-01-10 20:39:31 Hope you are watching bbc2 Joe @thebodycoach very interesting about coconut oil! 
2080 2018-01-10 20:39:28 Trump says he is pro environment, especially clean water, but he let's coal companies dump their garbage into streams, is making it easy to drill for oil off every coast, knowing they all leak eventually. He lessons areas for parks. 
He is delusional.

2085 2018-01-10 20:39:19 Wish we in the U.S. could convince "Duhnald" to educate himself on RENEWABLE ENERGY!! @realDonaldTrump  -- instead, he wants to drill for more dirty oil in the oceans surrounding our entire country, including Alaska / Arctic... #DeepwaterHorizon
2086 2018-01-10 20:39:18 CBD oil is vile - tastes like rotten fucking dirt 
2087 2018-01-10 20:39:10 If he could get “massive oil” out of the wall his life would be fulfilled.
2088 2018-01-10 20:38:59 It's true.  It looks like blood sugar regulation and weight-loss will be a fast growing category for CBD especially.  I lost about 25 pounds after my first course of CBD oil which may be able to regulate insulin...
2089 2018-01-10 20:38:56 *has already gotten truffle oil all over my web design textbook*
2090 2018-01-10 20:38:54 It’s really quite simple. Trump doesn’t want off-shore oil rigs ruining the view off the coast of Mar-A-Lago:
2091 2018-01-10 20:38:45 Well, a little bit of other news... my life mantra has now been changed to:

"I am for massive oil and gas and everything else."

Words to live by.
2092 2018-01-10 20:38:44 As Trump and his thugs prepare American oil interests while giving them care Blanche to destroy the fn world, our coasts, fishing INDUSTRIES, tourism, the DEMON whines that Paris Climate Agreement is unfair to . Soon we will be isolated like we have a contagious case of VD.
2093 2018-01-10 20:38:41 I’d like to see any oil company try. See what would happen.
2094 2018-01-10 20:38:39 and he just repeated NO collusion  20 times. And for the big one HE's for BIG OIL now we know all that Koch money make him a puppet to them
2095 2018-01-10 20:38:30 This is disturbing — all for greed over their oil/coal agenda

2099 2018-01-10 20:38:24 Is there anything stopping the state from charging a local tax on any oil brought onshore by these new leases?
They aren't going to tanker it somewhere else but to a CA port or shore facility.
Something like $1000/barrel would make the leases unattractive to buyers..
2100 2018-01-10 20:38:22 You are a rude egomaniac. You looked so stupid just now speaking in front of the world.We know you are for MASSIVE OIL (except in Florida) because the only thing YOU care about is profit. You are the one chasing WINDMILLS. You are disgusting. SO UNFAIR to the American people.
2101 2018-01-10 20:38:15 Very funny. NYC has its lowest crime rates since 1950s, thanks to the Mayor who hired more police and NYPD. He won re-election 66% to 28% over his GOP opponent. And he speaks for millions of oil/gas consumers in NYC.
2102 2018-01-10 20:38:14 Comprehensive!!!! Libs parrot this relentlessly EXCEPT when term applies and doesn't fit rhetoric. Wall is part of comprehensive control.
2103 2018-01-10 20:38:05 exfoliating ya skin and using coconut oil is life changing b
2104 2018-01-10 20:38:05 So do you want oil and gas or do you want renewable energy or do you just want what the other guy has?
2105 2018-01-10 20:37:58 i don’t think i’ll ever get used to using a dry oil spray but it’s the only thing that stops my face from drying out 
2106 2018-01-10 20:37:55 Part of the response from the oil companies should include the tax revenues the city collected from the sale of their products. Would love to see the companies close operations in NYC.
2107 2018-01-10 20:37:54 WHEN exactly was the last oil Rig spill.........that wasn't sabotage by eco terrorists?
2108 2018-01-10 20:37:51 @BillSpadea Bill de Blasio  is not going to use any NYC funds to invest in oil companies
2109 2018-01-10 20:37:41 Valuable heating oil .
2110 2018-01-10 20:37:40 Im getting my oil changed and I know their list of what needs to be fixed in my car is gunna go on forever 
2111 2018-01-10 20:37:27 At least I disposed of my old oil paint and pills properly without much hassle.
2112 2018-01-10 20:37:23 "I'm for big oil. Hilary was for windmills."
"But you guys have water...that hydropower is great...wish we could do that."
SMDH
2113 2018-01-10 20:37:21 They’re weaning themselves off of the oil that made them rich and outpacing everyone for the future.
2114 2018-01-10 20:37:08 I had zero oil in my wheel for idk how long. Im trippin 
2115 2018-01-10 20:37:01 Dude! Two minutes earlier, he said he was a big oil and gas guy, as he talked about how Hillary was an idiot for supporting wind power.
2116 2018-01-10 20:36:59 Question Chad: where do you drain the oil pan and where fill it?
2117 2018-01-10 20:36:59 I was supposed to change my tires and have an oil change today... but I overslept. XD
2118 2018-01-10 20:36:59 Up with oil down with windmills & Hilary, amongst the many confusing things that is Trump. What language is he speaking just when he makes sense, it all falls apart ?
2119 2018-01-10 20:36:58 California is one of the leading states that drills and exports oil. Why hasn't it hurt your coastline yet?
2120 2018-01-10 20:36:55 1) Energy independence is a myth in a global economy. Just ask Norway or Canada. 
2) We get more oil from Canada than from all the nations of the Persian Gulf combined. 
3) The US now exports oil, often to countries we also import it from. Again, see #1 above.
2121 2018-01-10 20:36:54 I was told in most cases you should combat oily skin with oils bc it’s caused by your skin overproducing oil bc it’s what your skin is lacking ? I’m no dermatologist obviously so idk how true that is 
2122 2018-01-10 20:36:45 Nigeria and Zim are in so many whatsapp groups together.

2123 2018-01-10 20:36:45 Who said anything about oil, bitch? You cookin?
2124 2018-01-10 20:36:45 OMG!!!!! We have oil!! Hillary wanted windmills!! HAHA!! 
Norway has water power! I wish we'd do that. OMG!!!! 
Doesn't anyone else notice this?! I feel like I'm taking crazy pills!!!
2125 2018-01-10 20:36:38 And he just said he would continue to only exploit oil and gas and Hillary wanted to explore alternate energy like "with windmills"; then flipped and touted Norway's use of alternate energy and said US should be doing that. WTAF.
2126 2018-01-10 20:36:36 What is cooking oil kuqala? Soyifanisa ne fish oil!
2127 2018-01-10 20:36:34 I could say the same about directions on shampoo bottles.

2131 2018-01-10 20:36:26 How dare I, the employee that’s been at work EVERY DAMN DAY SINCE SHES BEEN FUCKING SICK FOR A WEEK, have my diffuser running with peppermint and eucalyptus oil so I can breathe. 

HOW DARE I TRY TO FUCKING SURVIVE AT THIS DAMN PLACE
2132 2018-01-10 20:36:25 Yes, lets depend on middle east oil, because God knows, Exxon hasn't profited a penny here anyway.
2133 2018-01-10 20:36:21 What a bunch of crap, AND AGAIN HE GOES TO BASH HILLARY, DENIGRATES WINDMILLS, this man is insane,obsessed w/HILLARY cause he knows SHE IS RESPECTED &HE IS A LAUGHINGSTOCK,now touting MORE OIL&GAS,rambling re:Paris accord,YEAH EVERYTHING SUCKED BEFORE U EXISTED,all deals sucked
2134 2018-01-10 20:36:16 #MSNBC no oil drilling around Florida, it's to close to Mar-a-lago
2135 2018-01-10 20:36:07 For a Bugatti Veyron the price to change the oil is $21,000. Yes, you read that right.
2136 2018-01-10 20:36:04 There is an Afro-Carribean Shop in Dalston, London that sells every Oil under the Sun, and I use Neem or Frankincense Oil, and the Bottles last Forever.

2137 2018-01-10 20:36:04 The Norwegian oil fund is worth $192,307 per Norwegian, over $1trillion in total. 
Norwegians GDP per head is $70,812 vs US on $57,467.

They have money that needs investing!
2138 2018-01-10 20:35:59 He says he doesn't like anything but oil & gas but then contradicts himself by congratulating Norway for having hydro power. Does he not know what he talks about? @jaketapper @CNN
2139 2018-01-10 20:35:49  is on TV with Norway's VERY right-wing, anti-immigrant, OIL Prime Minister, Erna Solberg.  , of course, had to bring in Hillary ("Hillary was for windmills"....for no reason whatsoever, the bloody fool embarrassment). Show-off fool.....@justtish7
2140 2018-01-10 20:35:49 Riggs Asset Managment Company Upped Stake in Cabot Oil & Gas Com $COG by $466,622 as Shares Rose ...
2141 2018-01-10 20:35:43 Did this jackass just say he is for big Oil and big Gas but #Norway has great Hydro power & he wish we would do that! who is in a better f****** position to do that if not the God damn #President of the #UnitedStates.
2142 2018-01-10 20:35:43 Notice that totally self centered Trump is NOT allowing the oil drilling near his precious Mar-a-Lago.
2143 2018-01-10 20:35:42 and what about all that oil and gas Trump for.... and hydro power too! (hypocrite clean water, clean air he has rolled back regulations - geeze)
2144 2018-01-10 20:35:39 It gets Canada’s resource to international markets, bypassing the US that buys our oil at a reduced rate.  Which in turn adds to Canadian GDP. And that money funds Canadian society.
2145 2018-01-10 20:35:38 How embarrassing @BilldeBlasio is suing oil companies, since they are to blame for Climate Change. He needs to be committed to the Psych Ward at Bellvue. What a fucking Idiot.
2146 2018-01-10 20:35:31 Trump: I'm a big oil and gas guy. Hillary wanted windmills. 
Trump two minutes later: Norway has great hydroelectric power. I wish we had something like that.
2147 2018-01-10 20:35:30 Sure it's not chili oil?

2149 2018-01-10 20:35:24 The real issue is the unsightly oil rigs that will ruin the views at Mar-a-lago. Membership fees just went up, drilling could put all that new money at risk.
2150 2018-01-10 20:35:20 @realDonaldTrump MAGA! DON'T DRILL FOR OIL OFF OUR COASTS!  Water is Life Oil is Death.

2153 2018-01-10 20:35:04 "I am for lots of oil...And gas...And lots of other things."
2154 2018-01-10 20:34:55 @realDonaldTrump if you are for clean air and environment how can you be for big oil and c al at the same time? You news conference was a giant bipolar mess. And Russia-ALL agencies agree the meddled with our elections. You are making a mockery of our Nation. Sad.
2155 2018-01-10 20:34:54 @realDonaldTrump Putin doesn't love you being massively for oil?? You have lost your mind. #25thAmendmentNow
2156 2018-01-10 20:34:46 Thank goodness that Trump's massive oil platforms will save American coastlines from ugly windmills.
2157 2018-01-10 20:34:46 We’re selling oil into the Eastern block, undercutting Russia’s dominance in any industry they depend on greatly for revenue.
2158 2018-01-10 20:34:39 Turned on bbc news and trump is talking about how his opponent Hillary was for windmills and he’s for so much oil. At a press conference. With the Norwegian PM. How is everyone in the room acting like this is normal?!

2160 2018-01-10 20:34:38 The untold story behind the little told story of the alarming influence that the crazy rw Christianists have with Trump is that this whole admin is a takeover by fossil fuel industries, where Putin is a big player. Putin got his puppet to make an oil co. Secretary of State ...
2161 2018-01-10 20:34:35 Have said that back in March. and now at his press conference NO collusions he repeated 20 times now. He so guilty the more he's says it the worst it's going to be for him. Someone is whispering in his ears and he just said he's for BIG OIL.  Got ya
2162 2018-01-10 20:34:31 Love how @realDonaldTrump says Paris was unfair to US while standing next to Norway’s Soldberg who had 46% of exports from oil in 2016

2173 2018-01-10 20:34:03 In a joint conference with Norway’s leader Trump showed his commitment to and determination to expand big oil rather than green technology.

2188 2018-01-10 20:33:33 Trump calls turbines “windmills” and incorrectly says it’s less efficient than oil and gas. He’s so ignorant it hurts. How can one man be this moronic.
2189 2018-01-10 20:33:28 Gavin.  What can you do about this exception legally? Use it as the basis of exempting CA from drilling as well? What about wind turbines for every oil rig proposed using federal $?
2190 2018-01-10 20:33:26 ask the PM of Norway about their OIL PENSION FOR ALL ITS CITIZENS
2191 2018-01-10 20:33:25 Candles on a oil drum... hmm  #corrie
2192 2018-01-10 20:33:22 Cbd oil works miracles I just went from feeling like death to feeling shitty but sooo much better
2193 2018-01-10 20:33:22 @realDonaldTrump just said that opening up oil production would make Russia sad when Exxon and Putin want a huge development going it's why Putin put @RexxTillerson in as Secretary of State

Trump does not understand the Paris agreement
2194 2018-01-10 20:33:20 "I feel very strongly about the environment...I want clean water."

So let's fill the ocean with oil drilling!
2195 2018-01-10 20:33:20 I forget how young you are .   Yes, once upon a time, there were full service gas stations where someone would come out and pump your gas, check your oil, etc.   I know of 1 place in Tulsa that’s still that way.
2196 2018-01-10 20:33:19 Love #TrustMe - informative, straightforward, & cuts through the noise. I use coconut oil all the time so interested to see what they have to say about it...
2197 2018-01-10 20:33:16 Oil is there because God let the people discover it, Now the city who think they are god,wants to control it by threaten Gods people with money.
2198 2018-01-10 20:33:16 @sethmoulton Why can’t states buy their offshore oil rights/leases from the Feds? Then the states can decide what they want to do.
2199 2018-01-10 20:33:14 I definitely am! And the citicle oil is a dream as well. My hands are so spoiled!
2200 2018-01-10 20:33:09 Is anyone watching trump's press conference? God, he is so embarrassing. He just brought up his opponent Hillary. He wants massive oil & gas & Hillary wants windmills. Unbelievable!
2201 2018-01-10 20:33:04 "i am for massive oil and everything else. putin can't love that. hillary was for windmills."

- smooth brain potus discussing Russia with Norwegian prime minister

2204 2018-01-10 20:32:50 I legit asked to change the channel while I was getting my oil changed. Not only was it the news, it was  news. 
2205 2018-01-10 20:32:49 I'll have to have a read. I use olive oil for near enough all of my cooking, I never thought of sprays. 
2206 2018-01-10 20:32:49 hundreds of dollars. he charges on a per advice basis. lol. he’s calling for another breakout on oil. typical bs #WTI #OOTT
2207 2018-01-10 20:32:49 Question if I'm not mistaken we import more oil than we export correct??
2208 2018-01-10 20:32:47 Coconut oil
2209 2018-01-10 20:32:46 Eczema? Coconut oil.
Teeth whitening? Coconut oil. 
Hemorrhoids? Coconut oil.
Dry, brittle hair? Do NOT fucking put coconut oil in it. You’ll be walking around like someone fried bacon on your damn head!
2210 2018-01-10 20:32:43 Like Saudi oil
2211 2018-01-10 20:32:42 And of course he's going back to his favorite obsession - Hillary Clinton!
Also better to work with Russia (on dying)  Oil & Gas, Hilary wanted windmills!  He just can't let her go can he?
2212 2018-01-10 20:32:42 #FakePotus is for "massive oil and gas...Hillary is for "windmills"

2218 2018-01-10 20:32:24 Remote controlled oil sands mine trucks never have to stop to pee! In not too long they will all be driverless. They could be driven from mine to plant by a driver sitting in Calgary.
2219 2018-01-10 20:32:23 Alternative energy one of the industries that has the highest job growth but why support that. Windmills look beautiful in the fields as opposed to oil rigs. Heaven forbid we should support the way of the future!
2220 2018-01-10 20:32:19 For dry skin? Because i use coconut oil and it does what it needs to do.
2221 2018-01-10 20:32:18 Well it's a keloid, so try using tea tree oil I heard it really helps
2222 2018-01-10 20:32:16 PM Solberg gives eloquent answer about international diplomacy. 

#Trump: I do want to work with Russia and be better with North Korea, which shouldn’t have even been my problem it should have been solved and Hillary didn’t like Putin. But she wanted windmills. I’m for big oil.
2223 2018-01-10 20:32:13 I bathe in oil....very strongly
2224 2018-01-10 20:32:10 Oil xhaka give the corners to someone else cus your fucking shit at them #CHEARS
2225 2018-01-10 20:32:08 does trump know that gas and oil are the same. fuckin. thing
2226 2018-01-10 20:32:08 It's so clear that big oil has Trump in their pocket.  It's a GOP thing.

2228 2018-01-10 20:32:03 Trump: “I am for big oil and gas...” “Hilary was for windmills”
2229 2018-01-10 20:32:03 We demanded oil and they found it for us, but apparently now they are to blame.
2230 2018-01-10 20:32:01 You know there's something wrong with the world when Walmart puts the $5 coconut oil behind a case, but leaves the $12 coconut oil  out in the open.

Also fucked up that they are same size, same (one) ingredient, and just different brand names.
2231 2018-01-10 20:31:59 There’s just nothing I look more forward to than slathering myself in coconut oil after a long day 
2232 2018-01-10 20:31:55 Trump: "I am for massive oil and gas and everything else."
2233 2018-01-10 20:31:49 Yoons would have us believe England hasn't benefited at all from the Oil and Gas industry: it gave all the revenue straight back to Scotland with grace and dignity. Didn't spend any of it on wars or WMD, oh no... 
2234 2018-01-10 20:31:45 3 observations during this @realDonaldTrump press briefing 1. What is @realDonaldTrump definition of collusion 2.  Hillary Clinton is out of the picture 3.  Why so much emphasis on dirty oil vs. renewables yuck
2235 2018-01-10 20:31:40 It's BECAUSE if Mar-a-Lago that he's stopping drilling in Florida. He doesn't want oil rigs messing up the view.
2236 2018-01-10 20:31:39 Energy creeps into Trump press conference with Norway PM. "I'm for massive oil  and gas and a lot of energy. Putin can't like that," Trump says.
2237 2018-01-10 20:31:36 Incidentally "Massive Oil" is Trump's wrestling name.
2238 2018-01-10 20:31:36 As you can see, #Trump is still acting like a dinosaur, because he is one. Take your oil and live in it, but quit screwing around with us.
2239 2018-01-10 20:31:31 I am for massive oil and gas and everything else.
2240 2018-01-10 20:31:27 "I am for massive oil, gas....Putin can't love that.  I am for a strong military.  Putin can't love that.  But Hillary......"
2241 2018-01-10 20:31:27 Who told you that we do not need the oil?  Obama?
2242 2018-01-10 20:31:27 This just in @realDonaldTrump   He is for massive oil!  How massive does he want the oil?
2243 2018-01-10 20:31:27 "I am for massive oil and gas and everything else (...) Hillary was for windmills." Trump har funnet en sjelevenn i Erna Solberg, åpenbart.

2252 2018-01-10 20:31:07 Trump: I was for drilling for oil and a strong military. Putin can't love that. Hillary was not for a strong military and for windmills.
2253 2018-01-10 20:31:06 .@POTUS explains philosophy on #Russia. Better to work w/them on North Korea, for instance, and it's not all pro-Russia. "I am for massive oil and gas and everything else… Putin can’t love that. I am for the strongest military this nation has ever had. Putin can’t love that."
2254 2018-01-10 20:31:05 We've heard his excuses about Russia, oil, and gas and his default--Hillary, Hillary, Hillary!

2258 2018-01-10 20:30:58 Interesting--Trump talking about things he desires that offend Russia, citing desire to increase oil and gas production and enlarge the military: "Putin can't love that."
2259 2018-01-10 20:30:58 Oil change & state inspection today I can’t cook and do all this at the same time you know?
2260 2018-01-10 20:30:57 Fry plenty onions in the oil first before using it to fry ripe plantain. You can thank me later. 
2261 2018-01-10 20:30:52 #TrumpIsAMoron @realDonaldTrump 
You think Putin doesn't want natural gas and oil? You think he actually is a climate change believer and supports solar and hydro power? #Dumbassery
2262 2018-01-10 20:30:50 Sure this is totally bad for humanity, but hey, at least NY is going to sue oil companies for their harm to the planet, right?!

2265 2018-01-10 20:30:47 Good plan! Wouldn’t want to contaminate that nice clean oil with the sleaze from Mar A Lago.
2266 2018-01-10 20:30:47 But it’s s good idea to buy oil from Middle East right?  We don’t care about their environment - nor do we mind being held hostage to their pricing.

2295 2018-01-10 20:29:21 Bear in mind that all those wonderful social programs in Norway, that we hear so much about from liberal media, are funded by offshore oil production revenue, just as Saudis are funding their Islamic doctrine with their oil wealth.

2310 2018-01-10 20:28:04 If no one wants offshore oil rigs on the coast of their state, maybe, and just hear me out, maybe we should restrict the construction of offshore oil rigs through some sort of law or edict.

2317 2018-01-10 20:27:39 It’s essential oil (at least for some diffusers), which just means it’s a distilled essence of a plant so I think thc oil might actually work. The only thing idk is if the diffuser would get hot enough to fully vaporize it or if it would be wasteful
2318 2018-01-10 20:27:39 New York City divesting from Big Oil! That's swell news. How the other cities follow suit at least in the next ten years. It is high time.
2319 2018-01-10 20:27:36 Are they Chinese oil companies because the so called President ( I think this is a better term for the dullard formally known as trump) thinks that the Chinese created the illusion of global warming and he should know cos he's real telligent

2336 2018-01-10 20:26:10 Oil for the mustang?  Or  did I misunderstand?
2337 2018-01-10 20:25:27 correct, and Trump property that is his favorite. I love my Texas beaches, that the oil Ind has beat up. We want to be on the list with Florida too!
2338 2018-01-10 20:25:15 Not of to much of a start when your brand new facility automatically becomes the shittiest school in NL! Another drunk on oil Danny’s PC plan gone down the toilet. Gander children will be forced to wallow in it literally. The cost of LEGACY. #nlpoli
2339 2018-01-10 20:25:12 Oil is good. Therefore, drilling is good.

QED
2340 2018-01-10 20:25:03 oooh, i use the clinique moisturiser with facial oil and i love it but i need a toner so im gonna try this one
2341 2018-01-10 20:24:59 Colorado oil and gas commission regulators pushed back making a decision on pipeline rules. Local citizens ask that companies provide maps of all pipelines. But industry officials say the proposal creates substantial cumulative burdens #oilandgas #pipeline #regulation #rules #ENN
2342 2018-01-10 20:24:52 I want the Trump admin to exempt the globe from drilling. Yes, the entire planet. It's time to move on from oil. There is opportunity, jobs jobs jobs are available if we only try! @realDonaldTrump
2343 2018-01-10 20:24:45 Trump should ask her how Norway got rich.

We base our welfare on oil and gas, but can't keep our mouths shut about CO2.

Norway is a den of hypocrisy.
2344 2018-01-10 20:24:40 Wow,  I thought the Florida exception was a spoof, he didn't want to see wind turbines from his golf course in Aberdeen either. There can't be any oil off Washington or La.
2345 2018-01-10 20:24:40 The reason why some colognes/perfumes are more expensive than others is because they have more oil in them, making them “thicker”.
2346 2018-01-10 20:24:34 :( no bueno, coconut oil hates me
2347 2018-01-10 20:24:30 it i locking him to fucking oil
2348 2018-01-10 20:24:27 When you go get your oil changed and college guys are working and they understand the money struggle and give you a discount 
2349 2018-01-10 20:24:25 I too agree we don't need any more oil drilling, however, I do hope you Democrats decide to do more than just "resist" this year. You miss out on good opportunities acting like children
2350 2018-01-10 20:24:20 Class and Bannon=oil and vinegar
2351 2018-01-10 20:24:06 Sec Zinke, you should be protecting the lands you were entrusted with. The oil and gas industry will go the way of the dinosaurs. Perhaps working on clean energy programs, wind, solar and wave, and stop threatening our beautiful coastal states. FYI, California has more tourism.
2352 2018-01-10 20:24:02 Truffle oil flavored bagels
2353 2018-01-10 20:24:02 Bit disappointing watching @BBCTwo #tomkerridge recipes and using low fat everything. Not even a splash of olive oil. Really goes against all nutritional advice. Fat is good! This is exactly what people who really need help shouldn’t be hearing.
2354 2018-01-10 20:23:52 To truly stand with divestors, the Rockefeller Brothers should totally divest, become paupers, and start over.  Regardless of their actions and current investment portfolio, they are still filthy rich due to "dirty" oil, no?
2355 2018-01-10 20:23:51 Made the yummiest bacon, leek and potato soup, pot cost $2.60 and made 8.
4 leeks, 6 potatoes,250g bacon 
2 Bay leaves, oil & pepper.
Fried the sliced leeks & bacon, add potatoes, 3lts water and seasoned with pepper, summer for 1 hour, surprised that it didn't need any salt.
2356 2018-01-10 20:23:50 I'm thinking of arranging for an oil tanker to accidently run ashore at Mar-a-Lago and dump it's cargo.
2357 2018-01-10 20:23:45 Coconut oil and Dr. BRONNNERS soap. #obsessions
2358 2018-01-10 20:23:34 I ALREADY TRIED BRINGING THE OIL SITUATION ABD THE BEST WAY TO FIND IT TO YOUR ATTENTION ESPECIALLY OFF THE COAST OF FLORIDA SPECIFICALLY BOCARATON FLORIDA.  BEFORE THE OIL BECAME TO HARD TO DEAL WITH!
2359 2018-01-10 20:23:31 @DividendMaster plus state AG is looking for "victims" of "price gouging" and "late deliveries" for heating oil customers
2360 2018-01-10 20:23:24 Most transparent even if sometimes policy statements are as easy to follow as a driver blowing a 3.0. #MAGA 
2361 2018-01-10 20:23:20 I love your products the ultracruz supplements are amazing and my dogs coats look great after the shampoo, conditioner and oil
2362 2018-01-10 20:23:16 We would of had super fast trains and efficient trolley system by now if it wasn’t for big oil holding the country hostage by halting progress in energy and transportation
2363 2018-01-10 20:22:56 It's been reported that 45 usually only thinks of himself so a good guess would be, it probably has more to do with no oil platform being constructed any where near Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort than it does with an affinity to a GOP Gov.
2364 2018-01-10 20:22:50 If my rental needs a oil change do i have to pay for that ? 
2365 2018-01-10 20:22:49 Another fine example of profiteering. These companies keep changing the bar in their favour all the time. Reducing the product in size, filling the products with cheap rubbish (palm oil instead of butter as an example).
2366 2018-01-10 20:22:43 I am intrigued by the email from @IndyEleven because it mentiond Carroll Stadium, not Lucas Oil Stadium.
2367 2018-01-10 20:22:41 Who is going to start suing the rich and famous who use private jets, have multiple mansions, and consume 100's of times the average person's oil every month?
2368 2018-01-10 20:22:37 Thank you Senator Harris! Question though, how are outside oil companies even allowed to drill in our water? It's not their land, can't we just not allow it? This seems to me like a State's Rights issue, can we sue to block?
2369 2018-01-10 20:22:33 I'm fine with losing Sanchez but not Oil as well. That's just throwing in the towel unless we somehow but Cesc
2370 2018-01-10 20:22:31 A lot of snake oil in the description of that router, don't buy one thinking it's going to magically solve all your internet problems, it likely wont.

2373 2018-01-10 20:22:24 I just learned the essential oil blend that Vanderburg uses in her diffuser. I can die happily now
2374 2018-01-10 20:22:11 Oh I want to thank Congress and President Trump for the tax plan since Price of oil and gasoline are going up that means big oil gets more of my money and taxpayers money plus tax cut for them. guys in Congress and Mr. President you guys are OK.... that sarcasm you $&$(/:?$&@&$:
2375 2018-01-10 20:22:06 @StephMillerShow @TheRealTBone @carlosalazraqui FYI: Overheard this: Mar-a-lago is in Florida. Can't have Trump's beachside property tarnished with oil spillage. Other Governors just need a Trump property on the beach like Gov. Rick Scott has to get the same exemption.

2378 2018-01-10 20:21:47 I use the face shop rice water oil  cleanser and that’s really good! Light and doesn’t upset my skin at all!
2379 2018-01-10 20:21:40 job creator.... like oil clean up are green jobs
2380 2018-01-10 20:21:35 @RPGreyhounds if belle vue closes does that spell the end of racing all the land in Manchester why built houses the gra and oil pension fund should be ashamed
2381 2018-01-10 20:21:33 Our purpose is to uphold the constitution and do what’s best for the whole of the country. Not just the 1%. Shame on you, you snake oil salesman!
2382 2018-01-10 20:21:32 Perhaps if you did not promote illegal invasion then the fires would not have been started by them, no fire no flooding mudslides. Seems like cause and effect. Your policies are the reason CA is in bad shape not drilling for oil.
2383 2018-01-10 20:21:25 Oh! I do my own version but with coconut oil...a bit healthier. Yum!!
2384 2018-01-10 20:21:24 First off deep treatment/hair masks are the key.Cantu/maui/devacurl/curls/mielle organics/shea moisture.Can make this homemade hair mask-avocado,banana, a scoop of a hair treatment,coconut oil and whatever other hair oils u have 4 hair,scalp massages,the way u put ur hair 2 sleep
2385 2018-01-10 20:21:18 The oil in Generac pressure washer should be changed after every 20 hours of usage. RT to spread this #MaintenanceTip
2386 2018-01-10 20:21:11 Same goes to you “men”. Learn to change your own oil and separate the whites from the colors and cook more than a hot pocket y’all. Then good things will come your way. #waitonit
2387 2018-01-10 20:21:08 If you can buy an exotic in the first place, the cost of the service is like nothing to you.

Plus you could save a lot of money doing yourself. All you need is an oil pan, basic socket set, new oil and filter and either jack and axle stands or a set of ramps
2388 2018-01-10 20:20:40 Says “made in England” on the box though, so they’ll likely be dead by Brexit. Then I’ll barter the plant pots for some oil drum-roasted rat skewer from a wild-eyed trapper in an abandoned Metro tunnel, feed my kids with it, and it’ll all have worked out nicely in the end.

2391 2018-01-10 20:20:22 Federal agents raided 7-11 huh? WEll I hope they were looking for some corn syrup, hydrogenated oil, SUGAR, and fats! Because that's all there is there! And gas. chips.
2392 2018-01-10 20:20:18 Have they talked about oil production in #Norway yet? #ErnaSolberg
2393 2018-01-10 20:20:18 And their electorates will thank them regardless of party affiliation.

Drilling for oil off coasts is just so dumb when there is more than enough oil from fracking and traditional wells. It took decades for Alaska coast area to recover from the Exxon Valdez spill.
2394 2018-01-10 20:20:15 إخيراً 
2395 2018-01-10 20:20:12 Probably Manchester city and their fucking oil money.
2396 2018-01-10 20:20:09 The new tax plan stopped funding the oil spill fund
2397 2018-01-10 20:19:57 Any of my beautiful black queens available after I leave the barbershop to apply coconut oil to my beard?
2398 2018-01-10 20:19:49 Bowl of boiling water with oil of olbas in it , throw a towel over your head and inhale it - gives the skin a good cleanse too! like a sauna for faces
2399 2018-01-10 20:19:34 The pharmaceutical industry spends the most on politcal lobbying. More than the oil/gas industry, more than defense, and more than the banking industry.
2400 2018-01-10 20:19:30 It’s 3 PM do you know where your money is? The Dow and NASDAQ may have their first down day of the year! NASDAQ down 20 Dow down 43 !  BITCOIN-20 Oil 3 year high !
2401 2018-01-10 20:19:28 Do any of tlist have cleansing oil recommendations?
2402 2018-01-10 20:19:15 Fed’s Bullard: Higher Oil Prices to Lift Inflation Expectations. 

So the Fed's policy failure will be blamed on shale again
2403 2018-01-10 20:19:12 Yes they are. And are all related to the consequences of burning oil.

Sorry, you were making some kind of point?
2404 2018-01-10 20:19:12 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。
2405 2018-01-10 20:19:04 How about all of the other states too?  Their coastal waters are not for sale. Our national monuments are not for sale. Tribal lands are not your oil highways. Stop giving away America’s resources to corporations and the wealthy.
2406 2018-01-10 20:18:59 I used ACV before and it gave me an reaction. I use Manuka Honey. I can make a mixture and add tea tree oil. 
2407 2018-01-10 20:18:44 As a girl I hate going to get my oil changed ....they try to make up all these other things that “need to be done” as well  like no.
2408 2018-01-10 20:18:32 @ChefTomKerridge Chef can you explain about the oil sprays? There's so many different types available, which one is best for every day cooking? I couldn't believe what you just said about the kcal in olive oil! 
2409 2018-01-10 20:18:30 Florida has the I-4 corridor which defines Presidential elections. Plus, @realDonaldTrump would be furious if he saw oil rigs off the coast of his beloved Mar-a-Lago.
2410 2018-01-10 20:18:25 Who da fuck buy da tuna in vegetable oil 
2411 2018-01-10 20:18:25 Exactly. The man has golf courses in Florida. You try golfing when there’s the fresh smell of oil spilled on the beach next to the property.
2412 2018-01-10 20:18:25 Dear Twitter,
  I was discussing essential oil diffusers with @ClintFalin yesterday and he implied that I am a crackhead. I am still feeling attackedt.
2413 2018-01-10 20:18:20 Coconut oil?!
2414 2018-01-10 20:18:17 If to light Petersburg w/ electricity it's necessary that the smallest number of lives should perish, then let Petersburg be lighted by oil.
2415 2018-01-10 20:18:09 I'm so old I remember when it was called oil of Ulan.
2416 2018-01-10 20:18:04 it’s the only thing that’s helped my dry skin tbh...i got the sunday riley sunday school kit which has this, the cleanser, the good genes lactic acid, and the luna sleeping oil, and i like them all!
2417 2018-01-10 20:18:02 The lawsuits are an important way of underlining the need for companies like Exxon to take action. Put yourselves at the forefront of the shift away from oil. Don’t lobby against environmental protection.
2418 2018-01-10 20:18:01 I know how to change oil, but that’s not the only thing they do in the checkup
2419 2018-01-10 20:17:59 Just accidential put peppermint oil on my nether regions 
2420 2018-01-10 20:17:59 Really confused - you lost your weight on a low carb plan, how can you now promote calorie counting, low fat ingredients and horrible low calorie oil substitutes?
2421 2018-01-10 20:17:57 The ONLY good thing about oil rigs is that their existence gave us the scene of Henry Cavill Superman saving people on one in Man of Steel.
2422 2018-01-10 20:17:53 Sometimes I wish I could get all the rapists, put them in a huge pot full of extremely hot oil, and toss them one after another. I swear this is the least they deserve. Especially kids rapists.
2423 2018-01-10 20:17:52 I think tullow might be due a drop before pushing on again. Will see how it opens before deciding if it's worth top slicing a bit.
It has its best chance this morning of really pushing on and went sideways all day. Currently investigating small cap oil stocks. #TLW #toilinginoil
2424 2018-01-10 20:17:52 Clove oil if you have it, other than that a shot of whiskey held in the mouth where the pain is helps relieve it
2425 2018-01-10 20:17:51 I’m losing faith in the sincerity of NDP’s people policy also Phase. We are just basically ****ed. What grates morning n me the most is that these snake oil salesmen used put money to screw us over.
2426 2018-01-10 20:17:35 WHY? So you can sell them off to Oil and Mining Industries? #zinke #MrLocalVoiceMatters
2427 2018-01-10 20:17:34 also a special s/o to @IAmMaliahMichel I now drizzle olive oil in the shower and wow bless you girl  my skin thanks you daily
2428 2018-01-10 20:17:32 Loool invest in some biotin and Jamaican black castor oil
2429 2018-01-10 20:17:31 Crowd funding may in time reduce the need. Got a ways to go yet.
2430 2018-01-10 20:17:29 Oil will only soften but will rarely budge it on its own - can totally relate to the shed. I have it done twice a year now as always an issue ( look at me like it’s a treat ) get that jet wash on it and feel like a new woman #eartalk
2431 2018-01-10 20:17:26 Sue the companies that produce the oil that fuels our cars, planes and trains, heats our houses and provides our electricity.  Great plan there, deBlasio.  Moron.
2432 2018-01-10 20:17:26 That awesome ingridients love coconut oil #radiantwomen #tinselvoxbox #contest
2433 2018-01-10 20:17:20 The dough is easy to work with and tonight I had a small bowl of bigoli just with oil, garlic and chilli. Simple. Lovely almost nutty taste x
2434 2018-01-10 20:17:14 once i burned my whole face with tea tree oil
2435 2018-01-10 20:17:12 Best days for hikes! (Don’t go to the beach though... all the oil and hunk in the streets flows right into it)
2436 2018-01-10 20:17:05 I'm just here to buy sesame oil aaauuuugggh
2437 2018-01-10 20:17:04 In other news. Oil companies raise the price of heating oils in New York to stop global warming and cover the cost of being sued.
2438 2018-01-10 20:16:58 We only import ~25% of our oil, the rest is domestically produced
2439 2018-01-10 20:16:56 Lead by example: ban the use of products made from oil from New York City.
2440 2018-01-10 20:16:40 The price tag on an oil change & standard service on  a Bugatti Veyron $21,000.
2441 2018-01-10 20:16:37 So what "snake oil" is he selling?
2442 2018-01-10 20:16:33 Zinke is an idiot.  Obviously this isn't a place to dig for oil.
2443 2018-01-10 20:16:32 I wonder if Mar a Lago had a part in that decision. I doubt Trump wants to look at an oil drill from his resort.
2444 2018-01-10 20:16:31 Dude, what? Is it because of the filter, the oil?
2445 2018-01-10 20:16:25 A240 Kingston Road, Tolworth southbound 2 of 3 lanes closed due to oil spillage. Buses around the area are experiencing serious delays to service.
2446 2018-01-10 20:16:21 Oil companies should cut NYC off, to avoid doing anymore harm.
2447 2018-01-10 20:16:15 Given that the oil industry knew about, and then suppressed info on climate change, yea, sue them. Sue them like crazy. Hollow them out financially.
2448 2018-01-10 20:16:06 Just transition to 100% renewable energy for everyone. No new coal, oil or gas projects anywhere.  #Auspol #EvacuateNow #ItWasLaborsFault #LiberalsDoNotLikeYou #OneNastyNation #StopAdani #FreePalestine #FrackOffSantos #NoFrackingWay #BringThemHere #metoo
2449 2018-01-10 20:16:06 got the glycolic acid toner & rosehip oil about a month ago & have definitely seen improvement in overall skins tone & softness

2451 2018-01-10 20:15:47 I see you went to the oil museum in Stavanger at least :)
2452 2018-01-10 20:15:37 It's inevitable. Shocking though to see the ignorance of a plurality at least,  that accelerate the trend through misguided policy.
2453 2018-01-10 20:15:36 Watershed moment in the fight against climate change - New York’s $189bn pension funds are suing the world’s five biggest oil majors for #climatechange damages
2454 2018-01-10 20:15:32 Tom Kerridge criticising olive oil has just made me turn off!! #TomKerridgesLoseWeightForGood @BBCTwo
2455 2018-01-10 20:15:30 I heard the veyron oil change is 20k every 3,000 miles 
2456 2018-01-10 20:15:29 THIS IS A REALLY GOOD ONE! I used it as a hair oil
2457 2018-01-10 20:15:26 Of petroleum products yes we're a net exporter. But oil- we still import a significant amount- nearly half- of what we consume.
2458 2018-01-10 20:15:18 Its actually lovely, homemade, coated with olive oil, garlic, lemon and a bit of paprika and roasted in the oven for about 30 mins. Why would you buy it prepacked? Buy a cauli, slice it thickly. Done.
2459 2018-01-10 20:15:15 This fall we spoke w/ our Mayor & Comptroller to #DivestNY from fossil fuels that drive #climate chaos 4 world’s poor. Today they said city will divest huge pension fund & sue oil companies. @billmckibben has called this 1 of biggest victories in 30 years of climate movement.
2460 2018-01-10 20:15:13 I wish I was a Greek olive oil merchant living in the Western Mediterranean circa 500 BC
2461 2018-01-10 20:15:12 I have the contents of a small garden shed in my left ear. I was using oil for 2 weeks but not a jot has moved on as yet.

2463 2018-01-10 20:15:05 I’ve added in another of Pete’s previous recommendations. Tea tree oil inhaled in the old fashioned towel over the head method! Now this one I can guarantee works! It’s brilliant!

2466 2018-01-10 20:14:50 If you fail to put the right amount of oil in a fully working car for 7 years it won't work properly. At least you finally are admitting you are running down the NHS to give it away to your donors.
2467 2018-01-10 20:14:50 We need to remove these fools we need gas and oil as national product when the fiat currency USD ..fails to back new monetary system to compete in the world
2468 2018-01-10 20:14:48 NATO funding talks and 
"Norway, can we get some oil off ya"?
2469 2018-01-10 20:14:42 How much OIL is enuff for these crooks and corrupt fkrs.
2470 2018-01-10 20:14:41 Spray it with some olive oil.
2471 2018-01-10 20:14:41 You have to go to like, Flea Markets or those organic type shops. They have it though––people be fronting like they're wearing the real stuff. A lot of them are wearing the oil version. Same for Bond No. 9
2472 2018-01-10 20:14:37 Tea tree oil? :)
2473 2018-01-10 20:14:20 Witch hazel and vitamin E oil >> 
2474 2018-01-10 20:14:13 I'm calling it now: durian is a hoax. Here's what you need for a durian dessert for four:
- 1 tbsp coconut oil
- 1 big white onion, diced
- 2 cloves of garlic, pureed
- 1/2 mango, diced
- a pinch of salt
2475 2018-01-10 20:14:10 If you have an oil diffuser and own cats or small animals BEWARE!! Lavender, orange, eucalyptus are TOXIC to them and can make them very sick or cause death!! Only scents that are safe are rosemary and frankincense!! 
2476 2018-01-10 20:14:09 Let me ask you first, how many national oil training center we have in the south west, North Central, north west and East
2477 2018-01-10 20:13:59 Over an hour for an oil change. For real?
2478 2018-01-10 20:13:54 "we support Iran, but we try to sue people who protest the president, this is all a show for profit of oil, thank you."


2479 2018-01-10 20:13:53 I havn't hear Freebird in months.
It must be time to get my oil changed.
2480 2018-01-10 20:13:50 The oil change on a GTR is $300 

I can’t imagine what owning an actual exotic costs
2481 2018-01-10 20:13:49 that would be great. we can nationalize all of our oil reserves in the process!
2482 2018-01-10 20:13:40 Tricky to oil up those hard bodies without getting any in the wig and fucking up the powder job
2483 2018-01-10 20:13:37 Thc vegetable oil
2484 2018-01-10 20:13:36 I think I might wash my car tomorrow after I do my oil change
2485 2018-01-10 20:13:33 Lol yeah he threw a ton of folks under the bus this year. I said before he’s a snake oil salesman. This dude has won 1 game in 2 years!!! That’s damn near impossible to do. Hope he keeps his word and jumps in the lake like he said he would.
2486 2018-01-10 20:13:32 1870: Business - John D. Rockefeller incorporated Standard Oil in Ohio. #history
2487 2018-01-10 20:13:30 Mistake or no mistake, we don't want oil drilling off California's coast. Thanks you for making this a top priority. If Florida doesn't have to do it, neither should we.
2488 2018-01-10 20:13:22 Don't let him look at the refuges! He'll want to drill for oil! Keep Zinke away!
2489 2018-01-10 20:13:21 At the very least, California, like Florida, needs to be Exempted. California has so much incredible coastline and we cannot subjected to the disastrous effects of an oil spill.

2493 2018-01-10 20:13:10 Girl, this is a good routine! I, too, never use soup—just hot water on a cloth and of course, lotion afterwards. Sometimes coconut oil. It could be that I don’t have/get pimples, but it really works!
2494 2018-01-10 20:13:08 In 2018, the world's scarcest natural resources:
1. Water
2. Oil
3. Natural gas
4. Phosphorous
5. Thoughtful melodies in popular music
2495 2018-01-10 20:13:06 Time to also consider the threat to our democracy and security by paying billions of dollars to purchase oil from Middle East countries that hate us versus being energy independent.
2496 2018-01-10 20:13:01 What a childish take. We're fighting to save what's left of the environment; much more important than low gas prices. We depend on it for survival, yet we're destroying it. Plus if you care about economics, look at the cost of an oil spill. NJ coast alone is a $50B/yr industry.
2497 2018-01-10 20:12:57 Just bathed my scalp in oil. But I promise my scalp is gonna be dry af in 20-40 minutes.
2498 2018-01-10 20:12:54 The coconut oil,  the African Shea butter and that it's a cream it what I love most about it!  #TinselVoxBox #Contest #RadiantWomen
2499 2018-01-10 20:12:53 He’s using fake oil sprays now  he’s got a new book out, obviously sold his soul to the devil. Awful stuff.
2500 2018-01-10 20:12:46 Hang on a tick.... is baby oil made FOR babies, or made FROM babies?? Cause so far I’ve been smooshing babies for like an hour now and, NOTHING
2501 2018-01-10 20:12:44 i need a hoagie from Broad and Erie. If anybody go to max's tell Sheen i said mail me a ham and cheese hoagie with lettuce, tomato, pickles salt pepper and oil with extra mayo. i would say extra meat but if anyone knows about max's why would you say extra meat.
2502 2018-01-10 20:12:44 Gah... snark snark.  Perry disappointed ring is underground. . Hates sculpture... wants to drill for oil. Wants to eat bison.
2503 2018-01-10 20:12:43 New York City sues five big oil companies, asking for billions of dollars to protect the city from climate change #Forex
2504 2018-01-10 20:12:41 I need an oil change
2505 2018-01-10 20:12:39 Stole a SC seat. Passed tax bill that does the exact opposite of what you promised. Screwed up ACA reform. Stole National Park land to drill for oil and coal. 

What exactly are these "monumental achievements" that you're talking about?
2506 2018-01-10 20:12:34 #LoseWeightforGood....pasta and low-fromage-fraise Yes. That should do it!  NOT! @ChefTomKerridge 
Now he's rubbishing Olive oil!
2507 2018-01-10 20:12:28 Thank you Senator Feinstein. There should be no more drilling until there is enough research & understanding on how to effectively prevent oil spills and how to contain & clean them up when they happen. Oil companies should stop destroying our environment for their profit
2508 2018-01-10 20:12:15 Is it harder to get into a carwash, or get an oil delivery right now?
2509 2018-01-10 20:12:12 Sah aus wie Olive Oil
2510 2018-01-10 20:12:00 And u must use oil drops for at least twice a day for 5-6 days first or it won’t budge x
2511 2018-01-10 20:12:00 @MaddowBlog @maddow my day for making requests-hoping now that you have touched on several admin ppl connected to Thiele(sp) some time soon can you educate us further on Him/company? seems like they are pulling strings related to oil/natural resources & battling Bannon
2512 2018-01-10 20:11:58 either I’m really baked or something but this oil I’m smoking right now tastes like fucking strawberries and it is SO DANK
2513 2018-01-10 20:11:55 If y'all could go as hard as you do about H&M and put it on the oil industry that'd be great.
2514 2018-01-10 20:11:29 If local voice matters, then please take ALL these States OFF THE TABLE for offshore oil and gas drilling, please.  It's "unsightly"....and tourism matters, right?  Oh yeah, and then there's the environmental impact, as well.....

2516 2018-01-10 20:11:24 2 tbls of any oil or fat is a lot of extra calories for a mouse. In the author's previous study with Olive oil, the treatment mice also gained more weight than the check. So not a Canola specific conclusion.
2517 2018-01-10 20:11:23 Most certainly agree with the efficiency issues. One big reason for more local controls. A canoe is easier to turn than a oil tanker.
2518 2018-01-10 20:11:20 That said, Pebble has not received final approval from feds/state. And given uncertainty around size of actual oil developments in NPR-A and ANWR, hard to pin down numbers there, too.
2519 2018-01-10 20:11:18 I know more than a few Canadians who work in the oil sector who have done very well for themselves by putting in a tour of duty in the Gulf
2520 2018-01-10 20:11:18 Oil was found off the shores of Scotland and a country inside the M25 got exceedingly rich.
2521 2018-01-10 20:11:16 ปกติหน้าไม่มีสิวอยู่แล้ว แต่พี่เขาขายสบู่เคบีวี่ เลยอุดหนุน เพราะเขาบอกหน้าใส ไม่เคยเชื่อพวกครีมสบู่ห่าเหวนี่หรอก แต่นี่ลองดู สิวมาจะ10เม็ดละจ้า ขึ้นแต่ตรงคางด้วย เลวจริงๆ ไอ้เวร ครั้งเดียวพอ
2522 2018-01-10 20:11:15 I’m referring to the home game in Indy. If they play in Lucas Oil, FCC could have more supporters at the match
2523 2018-01-10 20:11:14 All I wanted to do was relax in the sauna with some olbas oil, instead I get my ear chewed off for 30+ minutes by a complete stranger who’s life story I now know 
2524 2018-01-10 20:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza this Spring Sampler will be: chewy crust with moist coconut oil and philly beef.
2525 2018-01-10 20:11:05 its 2018 and people still think coconut oil is good for your face 
2526 2018-01-10 20:11:02 Holy shit, I thought veltins was motor oil from the time they sponsored Williams in f1.
2527 2018-01-10 20:10:53 The coconut oil,  African Shea butter is definitely what helps this cream be so hydrating! #TinselVoxBox #Goldbond #RadiantWomen
2528 2018-01-10 20:10:48 You're suing oil companies because they cause hurricanes now? And you're bragging about it? Son, you are a special kind of stupid.
2529 2018-01-10 20:10:42 Florida a Red State #45 and Zinke crooked as Hell all about loyalty to #45 and big oil  $$ don't stay silent yell scream at Legislatures NO
2530 2018-01-10 20:10:31 Think of your product like an organism—growing, shifting, decaying—not an oil painting; a "finished" masterpiece.
2531 2018-01-10 20:10:19 Can they drill up your ass for oil Governor?
2532 2018-01-10 20:10:17 Don't worry... There will be plenty of jobs spraying Corexit on everything and scraping oil off of the beaches and wildlife. When it happens be sure to thank a republican!
2533 2018-01-10 20:10:15 Today in 1901 Anthony Lucas struck oil in Beaumont, TX. at Spindletop.  Spindletop was the largest gusher the world had seen and catapulted Beaumont into an oil-fueled boomtown. Its' population tripled in 3-months.
2534 2018-01-10 20:10:15 @Freedom1776__  How many "oil" people are there now in Trump's team?

2536 2018-01-10 20:10:12 But the alliance with Europe deteriorating,  thanks to you know who... supplying their oil with usa oil is now in wtf ville.  But i doubt their first move will be to buy instead from Russia? Nobody knows what brexit is going to do.
2537 2018-01-10 20:09:56 Was waiting patiently to get my oil change. The door reads “do not enter for your safety” so I waiting in the lobby and this bish comes out 20 min later saying “you have to let us know” omg omg omg fml fml fml 
2538 2018-01-10 20:09:40 even covered in oil, if this is a problem for somebody they are probably, too fat and too weak.

2544 2018-01-10 20:09:09 #DivestNY  So N.Y. City has decided to sue Oil Companies for climate change - While still having investments in those companies.  Then they want to remove that investment, and reinvest in what?  Green energy? obama lost BILLIONS in green investments.
2545 2018-01-10 20:08:53 It’s time for Big Oil to take responsibility for the devastation they have wrought.

2549 2018-01-10 20:08:13 Yes, let other countries with less environmental oversight drill oil.
2550 2018-01-10 20:08:10 Bruh, go ahead and eat! Its okay to rotate them tires. But, if she ask you to "changer her oil"...grab yo dipstick and RUN.
2551 2018-01-10 20:08:01 Could have gotten a free oil change but I’m too honest. I just had to tell them I didn’t pay yet.
2552 2018-01-10 20:08:00 Oh good. Going to ban all Fossil Fuel vehicles from the city? Stop using grease and oil on subways, LRTs, and buses?
2553 2018-01-10 20:07:59 It's call King drumpf wants it drill your coastline@$$$$ for big oil masters$$$
2554 2018-01-10 20:07:58 Now, will they be drilling for oil there?
2555 2018-01-10 20:07:48 Oil slicks will destroy beaches, businesses and tourist locales of Republicans as well as Democrats. Oil in the ocean doesn't have a political persuasion.
2556 2018-01-10 20:07:47 make sure you've got a good oil in there because all the good stuff in turmeric is oil soluble.
2557 2018-01-10 20:07:42 All good but we all must understand the pipeline industry is just as dedicated to to the environment as any Canadian.
The fact is that we must get our oil to shoreline to pay for the many programs David and other environmentalists want to implement. Life is good!

2559 2018-01-10 20:07:28 Since Trump wants to pull out of NAFTA, Canada s/withhold Lumber, oil & hydro, then where would the US be, they need us more than we need them. Trump states NAFTA s/b fair for all, but what he really saying everything s/b positive for US & does not give a damm about anyone else!
2560 2018-01-10 20:07:26 Alberta has 4 million people and actually 3-5 times the oil of Norway and a 20 year head start. Your point about ignorance?
2561 2018-01-10 20:07:25 Oil is highest import by far.
2562 2018-01-10 20:07:06 Oil companies haven't proved up everything in NPR-A, so we don't know the totality of what's there. Same with ANWR, same with OCS. All I know is that this winter, Conoco is employing approx 1,100 workers on what *is* proved up in NPR-A.
2563 2018-01-10 20:06:52 Or a load of oil is parked nearby. That smells funky as well.
Or like money depending on your view of the subject
2564 2018-01-10 20:06:48 Whenever I'm cooking and l don't get the taste l want, i just add more oil

2566 2018-01-10 20:06:43 Colombian rebels attack oil pipelines hours after ceasefire expires
2567 2018-01-10 20:06:40 Really stupid thing politically is that even Republicans in coastal blue states have businesses, want a pristine environment for their families, etc. so they don't want oil rigs polluting their coasts either.

 Not a Dem or GOP issue, just common sense. & we don't need more oil
2568 2018-01-10 20:06:40 Dumblassio, suing the Oil Companies for Global warming is like the big bad  suing the 3pigs for building a brick house. The guy's a whack job 
2569 2018-01-10 20:06:24 They need to make this oil change quick cause I’m ready to go back home
2570 2018-01-10 20:06:16 Oil, newsprint, fish (2 HS codes), and iron ore.
2571 2018-01-10 20:06:15 Radical liberal virtue signalling. Interesting to note that NYC won’t be returning the profits they made off of oil. Also interesting to remember Manhattan is heated by steam. ConEd
2572 2018-01-10 20:06:14 I just let this woman at my job convince me to drink cumin oil. The full body dry heave I had after tasting it, was something else.
2573 2018-01-10 20:06:08 I spent so much time trying to do a video of me putting oil on my face for my 1 second everyday thing that I’m now very sticky
2574 2018-01-10 20:05:44 Perhaps but I'm guessing Oil and Gas ;-)
2575 2018-01-10 20:05:35 Y'all, I found a packet of yellowfin tuna in olive oil in my cabinet at work! This was a beautiful discovery. With a pack of mayonnaise from Chick-Fil-A and a sprinkle of NatureSweet, I had lunch.
2576 2018-01-10 20:05:26 RT billmckibben: New York mayor BilldeBlasio was as eloquent as any leader I've ever heard on climate change today. The oil companies 'won't be rewarded any more. It's time to start paying for the damage you've done.'
2577 2018-01-10 20:05:18 Are you sure that is a good idea? Be careful not to drown in snake oil ;)
2578 2018-01-10 20:04:55 @cvpayne
@trish_regan SO THE #SOUTH KOREA LEADER IS A LIBERAL THAT EXPLAINS WHY HE IS BUYING OIL FROM THE #IRANIAN DICTATOR BUT NOW THE LIBERAL & THE IRANIAN DICTATOR HAVE A BIG ASS #OCEAN OIL MESS!
2579 2018-01-10 20:04:47 Y’all ain’t politically motivated? What’s all that about open the coasts and national parks up for drilling about then? And why is BP still in business after the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico?
2580 2018-01-10 20:04:40 Well resin doesn't stick to oil based stains, and that's all I have atm 
2581 2018-01-10 20:04:35 بشرو شيلة فصول وصلت نص مليون ولا لسى؟!
2582 2018-01-10 20:04:28 I remember for years in my high school years spending time in Galveston. Viewing the offshore rigs from beach. Until the repeated oil spills tarred the beaches was action taken to remove them.
2583 2018-01-10 20:04:28 Our country will be hit hard.   I don't see any way around it at this point.    and it's not just the Russians.   Koreans want payback,  too.  Chinese are using the opportunity... opportunists.   We will probably get enough oil going to keep europe supplied.
2584 2018-01-10 20:04:17 Laugh while you can, what resources do you have? Financial district already moving to Ireland & try borrowing without Scotland's oil the interest rates will cripple you. We don't need you but you need us #ticktock #Scotref #EndLondonRule #StillYes

2586 2018-01-10 20:04:00 This is why there's  #Corruption in our government  Why Russia worked with @realDonaldTrump  to get him elected & why those Russian Sanctions  are on his desk & why the @GOP @SenateGOP @HouseGOP  all working for Putin for Arctic  Oil Rosneft Russian state run OIL @maddow @CNN
2587 2018-01-10 20:03:59 @SecretaryZinke Is a tool for oil he cares nothing for for our future generations @realDonaldTrump to blame also. State's need to do what NY doing
2588 2018-01-10 20:03:46 #DivestNY is so dumb it blows my mind. Only NYC libs would think divesting from consistently earning fossil fuel stocks will help climate change. And they’re going to sue oil company’s for damages lmao what a joke
2589 2018-01-10 20:03:39 Why would I spend $25 on stuff for changing my oil and doing it myself when I can go to @pepboysauto and have them do it for $30?
2590 2018-01-10 20:03:33 Just transition to 100% renewable energy for everyone. No new coal, oil or gas projects anywhere.
2591 2018-01-10 20:03:26 Yo #Florida @FLGovScott you do know that oil floating on the water doesn't respect state boundaries, right?
2592 2018-01-10 20:03:20 We are Moving Past Coal and Oil at an Amazing Pace. Someone should educate @realDonaldTrump about that FACT
2593 2018-01-10 20:03:08 I forgot all about tea tree oil thanks
2594 2018-01-10 20:03:07 Saying we're not shipping plastics to China because they have banned burning plastics is a conspiracy theory? 
Sure, tell me the one about how big oil is somehow paying more than the £18bn funding the Uk gov alone contributes again?
2595 2018-01-10 20:03:07 Dead skin cells of the body can be removed by applying mixture of olive oil and salt. Replacing salt with granulated sugar can work too.
2596 2018-01-10 20:02:45 And now under #45 they can look forward to offshore drilling bringing oil spills and damage to beaches and wildlife!
2597 2018-01-10 20:02:38 I have sum baby oil 4 that asssss
2598 2018-01-10 20:02:37 Coconut oil is everything
2599 2018-01-10 20:02:37 .@CNN is all yet another ballistic missile...but China is allowing oil to go up.
2600 2018-01-10 20:02:26 Tax-funded expansions of our highway system- effectively subsidizing the automobile, construction & oil industries- have resulted in 50 years of negative economic & social outcomes for our city. Raising taxes to continue this path is like shooting ourselves in the foot
2601 2018-01-10 20:02:26 @CBCNews Network: Alberta.. enough already you got the oil you got the wealth you have increase in crime you got the most redneck Conservatives And now naked pool events who do you think you are Ontario?
2602 2018-01-10 20:02:14 You get a clue. We need to stop depending on oil. More alternative, renewable power and more jobs
2603 2018-01-10 20:02:14 It's a beautiful place. They've really taken a hit recently though. And only 2 years ago they had a pipeline rupture and oil spill in the ocean. It's a place of extremes geographically and climatically, with the disasters that go with that.

2612 2018-01-10 20:01:27 Well that should provide some comfort ahead of the beautiful coast of Maine being littered with oil platforms and petroleum stained shores.
2613 2018-01-10 20:01:27 The only reason @GOP Trump exempted Florida from his "Make the oceans a rainbow of oil slick" #OffshoreOilDrilling  proclamation is because lawyers convinced him that "Allowing offshore oil drilling everywhere except near #MaraLago" wouldn't stand up in court.
2614 2018-01-10 20:01:25 Or garbagemen, miners, oil drillers, carpenters, or anything that has to deal with the dirty parts of infrastructure of the world
2615 2018-01-10 20:01:19 ~Take the white of one egg and mix in a teaspoon of olive oil.
Beat to give a paste-like consistency and apply to the entire scalp and hair.
Keep it on for about 15 to 20 minutes and then rinse with cool water and a mild shampoo.
2616 2018-01-10 20:01:14 who chose oil over hemp?
2617 2018-01-10 20:01:10 @SkyCorridors I’m trying to wrap my head around the talk online about Venezuela looking to create a Cryptocurrency backed by oil? That’s doesn’t seem right to me. That’s not Cryptocurrency, that’s a credit system like with credit cards, right?
2618 2018-01-10 20:00:55 Have you looked into CBD oil? My local talk radio guy has a daughter with similar attacks. He was in congress but couldn't deal with them. He swears by it and said her attacks have stopped except for one when she had the flu. You might want to look into it.

2621 2018-01-10 20:00:49 Why?  You going to drill for oil there?
2622 2018-01-10 20:00:35 Instead of oil and coal focus on natural alternative resource's very concerned about our Washington  and Oregon environments
2623 2018-01-10 20:00:34 Why? So you can open them up for oil drilling and fracking? Or to cut down trees? 
#ProtectOurNationalParks
2624 2018-01-10 20:00:31 I also got essential oil in an ocean fragrance like body wash.
2625 2018-01-10 20:00:31 Have you checked the biggest oil reserves untouched by man in the "Dominican Republic " it's literally gushing out the ground!.. Also known for its gold, amber,  nickel and tropical sunshine!
2626 2018-01-10 20:00:31 Do NOT allow @realDonaldTrump to destroy our national parks, create a government shutdown and drill oil off our coasts
2627 2018-01-10 20:00:19 Tea tree oil at night on problem spots works wonders!!!
2628 2018-01-10 20:00:17 I need an oil change, I need to clean out my car & I need groceries BUT it's also my first day off in weeks with no plans and I really just need to sleep
2629 2018-01-10 20:00:15 Why not? Perfectly consistent from a constitutional perspective. More benefit for those that do.

2636 2018-01-10 19:59:43 Lovely #vegans! #help! I can’t find a good alternative to egg wash! I’ve tried coconut oil, almond milk, water. Nothing turns my #pastry nice and golden! Do you have any suggestions please? @Lilmissmeatfree @LucyandLentils @WeAreVeganuary @VeganBlogger78 @Veganbabelife 
2637 2018-01-10 19:59:41 Then she said her weave just needs water, not conditioner or oil sheen, water  Lord take me!
2638 2018-01-10 19:59:35 It feels very temporary. I would have liked to see the Suites built on the track closer to the field, but I thought it worked to get started. I don't think Lucas Oil stadium is a good fit though.
2639 2018-01-10 19:59:21 not caused by oil drilling !
2640 2018-01-10 19:59:16 There was some talk about the government removing oil and oil marketing companies from the Sensex.
2641 2018-01-10 19:59:08 Drunk elephants Marula oil has changed my life
2642 2018-01-10 19:59:06 @LindseyGrahamSC I hope you get use to oil drills off the coast of SC. Compared to Florida where Trump has houses.
2643 2018-01-10 19:58:42 aannnnnnndddd he's muted now. lol. I don't need a tweet to tweet book salesman. Or any snake oil. Whatever he's selling...
2644 2018-01-10 19:58:30 Campsen has a point.  South Carolina’s ports are ill equipped to service an off shore oil industry of any meaningful size. The economic scale just isn’t there.  For that matter, NC’s and GA’s aren’t either.
2645 2018-01-10 19:58:22 Because they make no $ there. They have $ or cronies in oil, steel, (thus, coal), etc. So removing EPA regs & restrictions & discrediting all  scientific proof while taking us back to the stone age!
2646 2018-01-10 19:58:07 Woke up to a $600 oil bill, but on the bright side I got an interview with a job somewhat in my field. Keep sending good vibes please, I need em.

2649 2018-01-10 19:57:51 Nothing bad about #RedCardToAPCAndPDP...But destroy these parties and they form new ones. It's a tragedy. Blood&oil sucking demons in power
2650 2018-01-10 19:57:39 Hard to tell diff btwn lying and trolling. More thn a little just thrown out as bait, MSM never fails to rise to it.

2652 2018-01-10 19:57:31 Oh @KushFruit about those instructions for this oil...
2653 2018-01-10 19:57:25 I think you are on something .... try and get this next FACT . The Scottish government does NOT get ANY of our oil revenues  . Now how hard was that for you to grasp.
2654 2018-01-10 19:57:22 Really simple, just cut it up like you would cut a potato for chips, dip them in a little flour and chuck in a hot pan of oil, that's it, lovely and crispy too
2655 2018-01-10 19:57:17 I think putting water in MY oiless fryer would be a healthier option than a little bit of oil. What can go wrong, right? Nothing, because I'm a culinary genius, assholes.
2656 2018-01-10 19:57:15 ads: u know that u should be eating fat-free its healthier
me: mmhmm
ads: WHAT ARE U DOING? WHY r u adding oil from the pan into you rice
me: :) all ur science is fake, made from decades of sugar-companies lobbying to push away the real problem. also pan drippings taste amazing.
2657 2018-01-10 19:57:14 ya se preparan para aumentar las naftas y el gas oil y el gas tambien ... Los mediaticos no saben como defender la estafa y la explotacion ! Los trolls de chantiemos desocupados!

2659 2018-01-10 19:57:04 Taking issue with Florida’s special exemption from offshore drilling, @RepSanfordSC tells @BrookeBCNN: “if this is not an example of ‘politics-as-usual’ I don’t know what it is” & calls it “self serving” since unfair to not want to see an oil rig from Mar-a-Lago as opposed to SC
2660 2018-01-10 19:56:56 if you do bring her on for that could she also explain NYC decision regarding pension and oil? would assume DJT WH is good for oil so they are taking stand agains oil?
2661 2018-01-10 19:56:31 #GeogChat we build as much 'fieldwork' in as possible.  We do a nice little tour of the boilers in our school. We still have oil delivered, a geographers dream, gas & a new building that uses geothermal! Get the fuel bills from Finance & the boys plot, analyse and evaluate.

2671 2018-01-10 19:55:45 Exfoliate once a week with bicarb, then moisturise with coconut oil or tissue oil. Works like a gem
2672 2018-01-10 19:55:41 These people have nothing to do?  Take their oil away.. don't sell petroleum products in NY...DeBlasio will sue them to come back almost instantly.. What a moron
2673 2018-01-10 19:55:40 My RMT uses straight coconut oil, which means I now smell like a seasoned chicken breast, ready for frying in the pan 
2674 2018-01-10 19:55:39 Think I'm about to OD on coconut oil.
2675 2018-01-10 19:55:33 Does anyone here work at a factory making car parts? Idk if it’s just a certain kind of factory but T smells like oil no matter how many showers he takes. I’m about to start working there and I swear if I have to smell that every second of my life, I’ll die. TIPS PLEASE?!
2676 2018-01-10 19:55:29 Well just check your oil, if it’s really low or really dark I would really recommend changing it, it’s a synthetic oil it will last longer!

2678 2018-01-10 19:55:22 I’m getting an oil change at a Valvoline and there is some DRAMA happening in the bathroom between a guy and some girl named Chelsea via phone call. Something about money missing and how he doesn’t like her being around Sean. Lots of F bombs dropped. Sounds intense.
2679 2018-01-10 19:55:11 So today I got my inspection, oil change, registration & battery handled now come to find out there’s 2 nails in my back tires  what is going on ?!?!

2681 2018-01-10 19:55:09 @LindseyGrahamSC hope you enjoy visiting you SC beaches and the view of the oil rigs. Why in the world would you want to open the coast to oil drilling!!!! You, sir, are a disappointment.  I am assuming there are pictures that are incriminating or embarrassing.
2682 2018-01-10 19:55:03 " Her"  truth to power. Run out of characters?
2683 2018-01-10 19:55:00 Kromski Fantasia! I usually oil mine pretty often but I can't find the bottle, so I ordered a replacement. It should get here today, but isn't yet.

2689 2018-01-10 19:54:25 Well even Columbus might not have predicted oil rigs business... um...
2690 2018-01-10 19:54:23 I wasted too much money on Bio Oil while pregnant considering I have a million stretch marks 
2691 2018-01-10 19:54:19 That screen noise goes right through me, I nearly obsessively oil mine. Which wheel do you use if you don’t mind me asking? (Fiber porn, I wants it. Lol)
2692 2018-01-10 19:54:17 I like to make sure I exfoliate with a scrub for acne and acne scarring once a week. Witch hazel toner helps balance ph = clearer skin. Use coconut oil on wet skin to help absorption. Drink more water always, best of luck to ya 
2693 2018-01-10 19:54:15 What do you think about @NYCMayor's lawsuit against the five major oil companies?
2694 2018-01-10 19:54:03 Really need vitamin E oil
2695 2018-01-10 19:53:47 I’m so confused. They can’t drill in FL. because of the beautiful beaches and the economic affect? However California, Oregon and Washington with beautiful beaches and coastlines which entails so much more land are okay to have oil pumping? These people are insane!
2696 2018-01-10 19:53:41 Also the Alaskan Wild Life Reserve is one of the last in America.  Why the hell would you want to ruin it by drilling for oil and gas,  Oh - yea, that's right - I forgot - MONEY
2697 2018-01-10 19:53:39 There should not be drilling off East Coast either. Why is the Trump Administration trying to do this anyway? We don’t need more oil! Our country is moving away from it. Is the administration in a time warp?
2698 2018-01-10 19:53:37 U.S. crude oil production is expected to climb to more than 10 mbpd early in 2018, reaching that milestone for the 1st time since 1970, & to continue to surge into 2019 to a record high, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said Tuesday #Oil #USA #Energy #business
2699 2018-01-10 19:53:33 Don't hurt the bad touch trio never messes with a secret between you thing Virgin olive oil comes from???
2700 2018-01-10 19:53:33 Right.Oil leaks and exploding oil rigs do nothing to the oceans, the fish, the air, the land.If it’s okay for CA to have more oil rigs, than it’s okay for Florida. How can you be this blind to Trump’s obvious disregard for everything and everyone as long as it doesn’t touch him?

2703 2018-01-10 19:53:02 Remind me where Mar a lago is. Will  there be oil exploitation on that bit of coast,?
2704 2018-01-10 19:52:59 Is anything lovelier than a jacket potato slathered in olive oil and salt and put in the oven until it's crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside? 
2705 2018-01-10 19:52:54 @brat2381 
You do know he let oil cos stop paying into a fund that helped clean oil spills now tax payers pay!
2706 2018-01-10 19:52:35 Just tapping the brakes to see how legal actions around that laptop play out.
2707 2018-01-10 19:52:25 it’s feels like someone pour hot oil all over my skin. i wanna die
2708 2018-01-10 19:52:24 I don't think Trump is trying to fix a shortage here.  I think he is thinking of the money in royalties & fees the fed govt will get plus growing US biz/jobs.  

Not sure he has considered low oil price will keep offshore drilling down anyway.
2709 2018-01-10 19:52:17 The stricken Iranian oil tanker in the East China Sea could burn for as long as one month, South Korea's Ministry of Oceans & Fisheries told < the blaze raged for a 4th day following a collision w/ a freight ship #Oil #China #Iraniantanker #Iran

2711 2018-01-10 19:52:09 This is fucked up and I hope you're taken to court over it.  We don't need you, the #PSYCHOPATH in the White House and oil destroying our coastal areas.
2712 2018-01-10 19:52:09 Olive oil body scrub makes me feel like a goddess
2713 2018-01-10 19:52:08 New York mayor @BilldeBlasio was as eloquent as any leader I've ever heard on climate change today. The oil companies 'won't be rewarded any more. It's time to start paying for the damage you've done.'

2716 2018-01-10 19:51:47 but you’re right, maybe I should of made my resolution to only buy sustainable palm oil products  #saygoodbyetonutella
2717 2018-01-10 19:51:42 Oddly, exactly the exact same amount was reinvested in the oil sands by the buyers of the assets, if I'm not mistaken. I'd be happy to be corrected on the point.
2718 2018-01-10 19:51:32 Issne woh oil tanker k issue pay bhi aisi baatain ki thee'n aur 4 din baad govt ko defend karna shuru kardaita hai
2719 2018-01-10 19:51:24 It's ok to have identity process in all systems in country..I hope govt is sure to track bogus employee as in teachers case,80000 fake..
Wish success.
But Canadian co.says adhar is in 97 crore loss, slump in oil prices giving false saving of 1500 crore???
2720 2018-01-10 19:51:20 They r buying hard assets - gold, oil, silver, metals etc with USDs that have buying power now before there USD holdings devalue significantly...
2721 2018-01-10 19:51:06 You dont get 'high' on the oil itself. Ask those who smoke it and vape it.
2722 2018-01-10 19:51:04 Trump knows nothing. Inside his brain is a great oil site.
2723 2018-01-10 19:51:01 Sleep with thick wool on your head. Douse your head with Frankincense oil.

2725 2018-01-10 19:50:50 CBD if you can get your hands on it!! Vape CBD oil, also here are herbal vapes with different herbs for anxiety relief too
2726 2018-01-10 19:50:44 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, just wan't to let you know the gas prices are really going up, what happen to self sufficient. Keep the oil fields open, don't let the states change your orders. Get rid of the dreamers because my kids and grand kids have dreams to...
2727 2018-01-10 19:50:42 Why so we can keep being forced to buy oil from the Middle East and other areas supporting them and supporting terrorism in the process.  We need to end our foreign dependency on oil and the only way we can do that is by drilling in our own country.  Get a clue!
2728 2018-01-10 19:50:40 Lol, it's not only tyres though. Everything in, around, and on top of the tyres, heck, even petrol and oil, everything would be compromised. See why I say, conspiracy bra. They got flying cars and keeping it from us. 

WOO WEE WOO WAH WEE WOO
2729 2018-01-10 19:50:38 I just need to decide which base oil to use; Almond, Wheatgerm, Grapeseed, Coconut, Argan???? Decisions, decisions!!!!???

2731 2018-01-10 19:50:23 Those who subscribe to the NIMBY philosophy should not be allowed to use the service that is in question... no oil pipelines? No oil products or fuel!  No power transmission lines? No electricity!

2737 2018-01-10 19:49:43 I'm not the world's greatest cook but even I could slice up a cauliflower, toss it in oil and seasoning and roast it in a hot oven. I can see why people are ridiculing M&S over this.
2738 2018-01-10 19:49:37 sustainable palm oil is probs the most sustainable option for vegetable oil that we have, cause of it’s higher yield  #trustinnthepalmoil
2739 2018-01-10 19:49:37 Ha! I’m not the only person putting oil on my cat. It’s good, we all need a little moisture this time of year. Also it makes him smell really good!
2740 2018-01-10 19:49:36 its great to get oil and water and smash them together to feel morally superior to everyone else
2741 2018-01-10 19:49:34 Trump doesn't want fracking/oil rigs in view of Mar-a-largo but it's fine for the rest of the country. fine example of the president for the people
2742 2018-01-10 19:49:31 It’s all that olive oil - Gemma  @itvcorrie #CoronationStreet
2743 2018-01-10 19:49:26 italians living longer because of “all that olive oil”. huh. #CoronationStreet
2744 2018-01-10 19:49:25 Well is it for an oil change?
2745 2018-01-10 19:49:25 So, you're exempting the state where the our current president has oceanfront property that will be devalued by the view of an oil rig or if a spill occurs...got it.
2746 2018-01-10 19:49:12 Well that's -good- oil. Probably means you can add -more- butter.
2747 2018-01-10 19:49:12 Everytime I go to get an oil change They convince me to do more stuff and I end up spending over 100 
2748 2018-01-10 19:49:06 He was Italian, they live longer, all that olive oil.  #Corrie

2750 2018-01-10 19:48:57 It's a fryer thingie so you can enjoy the taste/texture of fried foods without all the grease/oil. Coworker put me up on it.
2751 2018-01-10 19:48:55 In their dreams...most clueless and shameless national oil company in the world ...they have made Nigerians to struggle for fuel  for over 20 years now.
2752 2018-01-10 19:48:55 Can you tell me which "devolved powers Scotland has which can be used to further change the oil revenue being collected down South "?
2753 2018-01-10 19:48:54 Went to the store for lavender oil but was intuitively drawn to clove bud instead. Took a sniff and was flooded with memories of our first dates in the woods 2+ years ago
2754 2018-01-10 19:48:44 Ladies do you want slack or do you want an ass rub? Id like an ass rub.... breast massages are also good with warm oil please
2755 2018-01-10 19:48:15 When hasn’t oil drilling affected the environment or animals eco systems?
2756 2018-01-10 19:48:13 Common sense and basic economics wins every time no matter how you " feel" about it.
2757 2018-01-10 19:48:11 @680NEWS You just announced that EnPro says the GTA gas price is going up 1 cent tonight. No reason given (because there are none valid). No competition, all collusion. An Oshawa consulting company in cohorts with all GTA oil providers. And you news media say nothing... Big joke.
2758 2018-01-10 19:48:08 You're complete moron. How many oil spills happen every year around the world with other countries that are doing tons of offshore drillin? Not that much. And we have better technology now than they do. Stop feeding into the liberal lies and conspiracies.
2759 2018-01-10 19:48:08 Together Vic and I should give you a massage Dani I will bring the vitamin e oil
2760 2018-01-10 19:48:00 We should all chip in and buy an oil well to be placed about 40 feet from Mar A Lago. Every time he’s there we press the button that causes a gusher which drenches his lawn. Maybe even throw in some oil covered duck decoys.
2761 2018-01-10 19:47:50 It’s amazing- works so well. Tastes like motor oil
2762 2018-01-10 19:47:34 انتي هيلا بنت صخر؟!
2763 2018-01-10 19:47:22 Oh well. You won't answer the questions about carbon tax, low-carbon fuel standards, CCS, and lobbying for methane regs, instead of against them. Another question. I thought you represented oil and gas (the industry). Or do you represent coal too?

2765 2018-01-10 19:47:12 Cbd oil is also good for providing nutrients, obtainable from breastmilk, which mothers who cannot breastfeed can provide to their children through CBD oil from what I have studied.

2775 2018-01-10 19:46:07 You only get to destroy off 1 vehicle a month. PUT SOME OIL IN THAT POOR CAR!!! 

(sorry if that was #toosoon)
2776 2018-01-10 19:46:01 I've been waiting so long for this oil change that I'm starting to think that they crashed my car and are trying to put it back together
2777 2018-01-10 19:45:56 my car is only a year and half old and i’ve already gotten three oil changes

2780 2018-01-10 19:45:33 I first read this as ‘baby oil’ and I was very concerned for a moment
2781 2018-01-10 19:45:23 Will Cain called LaVar Ball “carnival barking snake oil and a fraud” and I’m like how? Lol there is nothing fraudulent about what he’s doing.
2782 2018-01-10 19:45:20 Oooh I never thought of that! I’ll try them both and see which is best, I just used oil and soy sauce and it made it really firm and a bit crispy so the only way is up, if you ask me
2783 2018-01-10 19:45:18 Have you tried our new Mediterranean Smoked Turkey yet? It's yummy! Mesquite Smoked Turkey, sweet red peppers, black olives, hummus, and lettuce on toasted ciabatta lightly drizzled with olive oil. #SoulFullSandwiches #Hoboken
2784 2018-01-10 19:45:07 Waiting for an oil change & talking on my phone to my wife about some crazy customer screaming out here... then it picked up on the Bluetooth on my car in the shop.

2786 2018-01-10 19:44:58 Still haven’t taken my car for a oil change.. I’m such a procrastinator 
2787 2018-01-10 19:44:54 เจ็บแล้วไม่จำคือกูเอง
2788 2018-01-10 19:44:48 Anyone know why castor oil is so awesome
2789 2018-01-10 19:44:46 Wish I had a clever name for it, but long milk and wheat vs short lumber and oil feels like the right commodity pairs trade here.
2790 2018-01-10 19:44:14 GOP pols (Rubio, Scott etc) get FL exempted from off shore drilling. So, oil independence and good new jobs aren't really that important? Whatever.
2791 2018-01-10 19:44:07 I won’t defend the clown in office, but this woman would be throwing oil on a fire
2792 2018-01-10 19:44:03 Why would you blame President Trump?  

Governor Brown is who has done all the damage.

Why are some out there wanting Cali to have oil spills now.  We have natural seepage.
2793 2018-01-10 19:43:59 Every politician you have is supported by the oil industry to gain reelection. Sueing is biting the hand that feeds them. What they are saying is baloney to appeal to the Church of Climate Change congregation to gain votes because they are losing voters daily as NYC crumbles.
2794 2018-01-10 19:43:31 Trump has been on each side of every issue being his is a snake oil salesmen

2800 2018-01-10 19:43:02 Republicans need to finally behave themselves & stop downsizing & undoing some great things Americans have enjoyed for years like: national parks, monuments & refuges; fishing & recreation on seashores (all now opening for oil production and ugly drilling rigs); & abolishing DACA
2801 2018-01-10 19:42:59 @PuertoRicoPUR With 19 million barrels of undiscovered oil and 244B cu ft of undiscovered natural gas in the Puerto Rico, United States could buy the island under eminent domain and use it to explore oil & natural gas. This could be a way to pay back bond holders that lost money.
2802 2018-01-10 19:42:50 Oil free primer!! I always always always, wash my face, exfoliate, moisturize, and then prime before I put makeup on
2803 2018-01-10 19:42:41 except that without oil NYC wouldn't exist anymore.
2804 2018-01-10 19:42:40 Oil change done car clean now on my way to get my haircut
2805 2018-01-10 19:42:39 Please tell why they are divesting from oil. And what are they investing in instead. TY
2806 2018-01-10 19:42:39 @Bamabroker get your full oil short?
2807 2018-01-10 19:42:39 Florida pols present the APPEARANCE of protecting beaches against oil slicks and unsightly oil platforms, but there's a big pile of money and they want their cut.
2808 2018-01-10 19:42:32 Hearing that the @WHLGiants are pitching hard to get Davis Koch, 19-year-old winger from the Oil Kings.
2809 2018-01-10 19:42:14 Again, lackluster performance doesn't translate to poor market performance. When the last was on seat, what were market indices like considering oil prices were ok?
2810 2018-01-10 19:42:09 The USA is still a net importer of carbon based energy and a net importer of oil/gas based products.
2811 2018-01-10 19:42:03 I'll be watching from my cabin at work - On an oil tanker! #burnblue
2812 2018-01-10 19:41:56 - I HAVE To Get A Oil Change Tomorrow. Literally A MUST 
2813 2018-01-10 19:41:54 I don’t have in depth knowledge about everything there. I will say that my doc told me there is such a thing as taking too much  D, tho this is not a commonly held opinion. I only take cod liver oil for D.
2814 2018-01-10 19:41:47 Yes! All the time! My Iranian grandmother used to swear by turmeric and argan oil
2815 2018-01-10 19:41:45 Gold and Sullivan are snake oil salesman; talk big and then never deliver.
2816 2018-01-10 19:41:44 Which reminds us of Sadam Hussein setting oil wells on fire when he invaded Kuwait that resulted in the pollution  equivalent of 750 million automobiles.
2817 2018-01-10 19:41:42 I feel as if God will allow you to have a flat tire so you can pull over to realize you’re oil pan is leaking.

2819 2018-01-10 19:41:29 I’ve had my bio oil for like 5 years and idk if it expires or not
2820 2018-01-10 19:41:26 What would be better is if big oil would divest itself of NYC.  If you think the last week was cold, you could look forward to freezing your ass off EVERY week for three or four months a year.
2821 2018-01-10 19:41:26 Hey hey you guys... I have a really great show planned for tonight so I hope you guys can make it. It's bodypaint and oil! Like whaaaaaaaa....
2822 2018-01-10 19:41:23 So basically, our options are: oil and butter in coffee... or bone broth....
2823 2018-01-10 19:41:20 It is also called The Industrial Military Machine... and without Middle East oil? It is worthless. Connect the dots. Ding. Ding.
2824 2018-01-10 19:41:11 For the first time I just put oil in my own car three quarts to be exact and apparently that’s not enough
2825 2018-01-10 19:41:09 Brighton away last season a fan said he’s not turning a boat around he’s turning an oil tanker around
2826 2018-01-10 19:40:44 Thank you Bette.  

Oh about the oil spills, we have natural seepage . 

Worst of all we have Governor Brown .....

2830 2018-01-10 19:40:17 Right?  The Oregon Coast is one of the most beautiful places to visit. Wouldn't want to go if there were oil rigs there.
2831 2018-01-10 19:40:13 Because Barack Obama let BP oil rig flow. Changed weather. Killed a lot of wildlife. And phytoplankton. Then he wanted people to visit Gulf Coast and get sick. He is sick. Bet he’s from Saudi Arabia.
2832 2018-01-10 19:40:08 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
2833 2018-01-10 19:40:03 You might also see a very big gold for oil deal run through Iran and Turkey...which as we know from articles earlier this year, happened
2834 2018-01-10 19:40:01 What islegal about allowing something illegal tohappen. This idiot has drank too much of BHO’s snake oil
2835 2018-01-10 19:40:00 nooooo don't do it. Put some butter and coconut oil in it
2836 2018-01-10 19:39:58 Same omg I was freaking out about an oil change and tire rotation
2837 2018-01-10 19:39:56 I think it's a wrong move because we need the oil, but your suffering from wishful thinking on the Legal end.
2838 2018-01-10 19:39:52 @realDonaldTrump , the eternal scam artist & slimy snake oil salesman  I see another lawsuit settlement in his future.

2845 2018-01-10 19:39:12 Let's focus more on how much money oil companies and politicians make with incentives. Compared to minimum wage. That's real talk. Not this bullshit.
2846 2018-01-10 19:38:57 You fry the potatoes in quite a lot of olive oil before they go into the filling.
2847 2018-01-10 19:38:49 Dont be worried if you have oily hair cuz your skin's oil is actually very good for your hair!
2848 2018-01-10 19:38:41 Sorry to be a bore but I just got a beast of a water ring out of my glorious hardwood table. With olive oil. Magical magical olive oil. Feeling quite smug.

2853 2018-01-10 19:38:17 Gold will rise dramatically. Where other floating curremcies settle will depend upon debtor/creditor status in terms of oil as well as gold holdings...
2854 2018-01-10 19:38:01 you could super easy modify it! make a rub from the spices instead of a marinade, then squeeze some lime juice on when it's done! then make a mango salsa instead of a dressing, and you've cut out all the oil.
2855 2018-01-10 19:37:44 Still injured, had to shovel anyway for oil guy, kids kept me up all night, accidentally backed into baby sitter's car as I was going to run errands - BUT... have the best day job in the word, so all good. THANK YOU.

2858 2018-01-10 19:37:28 The oil to be drilled off our coasts would actually go to China through Exxon. The risk is all ours.The funds for cleanup in case of oil spill have been allowed to expire, we get nothing & lose everything!

2864 2018-01-10 19:36:36 In the past we feared US being dependent on foriegn oil. Now we are dependent on foriegn purchases of our rolling debt. A precarious situation for our entire economy if the funds dry up. #nationaldebt
2865 2018-01-10 19:36:22 @PurdyPaintTools I cannot believe after paying for your expensive brushes that today I used a 2" blue brush for oil based paint and the hairs/strands were coming out on my paint work, I counted 15 strands and I am well disappointed, what has happened to Purdy?

2868 2018-01-10 19:36:15 But insurance cost are going way up (if you can even get insurance) and with oil prices rising and inflation waiting, we will be way worse off.

Just purchased ur 2001-2005 STi direct fit oil cooler and watched your installation vid... however the wrx In your vid doesn’t have the power steering cooler and so I wondered do you provide installation instruction for when one is fitted as per the WRX / STi UK?

2873 2018-01-10 19:35:56 But first I gotta tell my dad he gotta change the oil in my car 
2874 2018-01-10 19:35:50 Given the mayor of the largest city in America has announced that they will sue and divest from 'Big Oil' does that mean the city will not welcome the possibility of the ARAMCO IPO or discourage the many benefits that said sector has provided?

The hypocrisy of it all.
2875 2018-01-10 19:35:49 I’m currently waiting at the auto shop so my car can get its oil changed, and they keep calling me “Ms. Groves” and I honestly love it lol
2876 2018-01-10 19:35:45 and where is the oil
2877 2018-01-10 19:35:40 I told a Hebrew friend of mine how funny you were. He spent 20 minutes looking at a Fram oil filter and said he didn’t get it.
2878 2018-01-10 19:35:40 My da gave me a doin because I got bike oil all over mine.Loved it.The strip,not the doing.

2880 2018-01-10 19:35:12 Ed Sheerans quaking in his boots at this fella. Love it when he brings the shaker instrument out. Not sure if it was juice or cooking oil. Made my night that.
2881 2018-01-10 19:35:00 doesnt stop equities, why oil?
2882 2018-01-10 19:34:59 Drowning pizza in olive oil  i need to try that
2883 2018-01-10 19:34:58 amazing that you are switch from having your salary paid by the Qataris from your Brookings Doha time to giving succour to the UAE. Kinda like your flip flopping from the KRG begging the Ministry of Oil for Money to being a avid Maliki supporter
2884 2018-01-10 19:34:55 Anadarko is in talks to sate China’s increasing appetite for LNG from its planned development in Mozambique > China’s record-breaking gas demand could help spur investment decisions on projects to export LNG from East Africa #Oil #China #Mozambique #anadarko
2885 2018-01-10 19:34:50 This certainly isn’t the first or last oil spill due to offshore rigs. You don’t think having a rig in Elliott Bay would have negative consequences? You think these oil companies don’t cut corners to save money? It can only happen somewhere else?
2886 2018-01-10 19:34:46 As if those companies are responsible for every oil and gas burner in the city. Now that Indian Point is going offline, won't more fossil fuels have to fill the energy gap.
2887 2018-01-10 19:34:37 Soup tonight is Ibiza pumpkin soup (from cookbook Eivissa). Thought it was nice enough when cooking, bit sweet, but seasoned with sherry vinegar and sage oil, it is superb.

Less #Benghazi, more #SanDiego.
2889 2018-01-10 19:34:21 You know where spills are more likely to occur?
When you are bringing oil from other countries here on tankers.
You are fine with other countries spilling oil while collecting or transporting oil, as long as you don’t know about it, your conscious is clear right?
2890 2018-01-10 19:34:19 #bigoil should grow a pair and tell deblabio if he wants oil for #nyc that he can suck it out of the ground with his stupid liberal mouth!
2891 2018-01-10 19:34:14 Imagine you had snake oil medication, and it was turned into a soda... and let's just say for argument's sake, that it was prescribed be medical professionals, but was really just the step-sister of a bad Coca Cola imitation... That'd be the Legend of Moxie.
2892 2018-01-10 19:34:09 I have a friend who developed adult cystic acne and she tried washing her face at night with oil (avocado or coconut). It took her a few times to not be weirded out doing it but she swears by it. There’s something about it that will help your body from over producing oil & idk

2910 2018-01-10 19:32:46 Did anybody notice that New York City is suing five oil companies because they are responsible for global warming, during one of the greatest snowstorms of the century. DeBlasio really is an idiot. Way to go New York.
2911 2018-01-10 19:32:45 demand for oil, propane and gas is so high right now because everyone is letting their tanks run low so its happening to literally everyone so they’re doing a lot of overtime business rn lol
2912 2018-01-10 19:32:44 This is so sad. But hey... how about if we deregulate oil? how about if we add offshore drilling leases for all of our coastline except Florida where 45 has property... Hey... how about if we just let this administration destroy our water, land and air...Yeah that's a great idea

2932 2018-01-10 19:30:39 No, read your original tweet. You didn't say oil and gas. You just said "the industry." And those energy-related emissions are going down primarily due to natural gas.

2941 2018-01-10 19:30:07 Ok. Science and logic aside...oil spills are very real and very bad. Without the sea humans will no onger be able to live on this planet.
2942 2018-01-10 19:30:06 last year we extended our carbon cap-and-trade program through like 2035 over the strenuous objections of the oil and gas industry
2943 2018-01-10 19:30:04 Why this discussion when repeatedly government is telling that Kashmir along with POK is property of India. Media unnecessarily dropping oil into fire.
2944 2018-01-10 19:30:03 Energy independence from off shore drilling? Where did you get that idea? Off shore drilling is good for one thing. Enriching the oil companies. That’s it. And the danger it poses environmentally cannot be ignored. Do your homework
2945 2018-01-10 19:30:00 like Indianapolis Colts Lucas Oil Stadium?!? that's going to be a lot of tarps.
2946 2018-01-10 19:29:42 We had solar plant poc back in Henry Ford’s day. The industrialists killed those mirrors-boil-water plants so we could burn JP Morgan’s oil.

2948 2018-01-10 19:29:38 Scared his golf course may get polluted? Maybe it’s just that drilling platforms aren’t aesthetically pleasing. Know he doesn’t like wind farms - maybe feels the same about oil rigs.

2951 2018-01-10 19:29:27 When the Oil finally do call it a season, there's absolutely ZERO point in playing 97-29 together, right?! I mean, aside from trying to goose their #'s. Like, there's no team benefit to it. And there absolutely *is* benefit to playing them apart, even if 29 plays RW.
2952 2018-01-10 19:29:23 'you are what you eat' man i should really tone it down with the extra virgin olive oil

2954 2018-01-10 19:29:07 I really like the hask monoi coconut oil conditioner for in the shower, along with the hair masks from the same company are super hydrating.
2955 2018-01-10 19:29:01 The theory is that your head is producing more oil to combat the fact that your washing the oil out of your hair everyday. Therefore if you wash your hair less your head will produce less oil making you less of a greasy person..... Bitch
2956 2018-01-10 19:29:00 Trump is, in a twisted way, and eye opener for the blinded US public that actually believes their children and soldiers in the US Army have died defending ideals and not oil, mines, real estate, and more, and a small bit of poetic justice for US vassal (colonized) countries.
2957 2018-01-10 19:28:56 when will this oil finish no that our politicians can use their heads?  Oil money has made them very lazy

2960 2018-01-10 19:28:40 ? So ignorant. Norway only has 5 million people and has more oil production. Also equalization payments sent it to Quebec and other have-not provinces.
2961 2018-01-10 19:28:24 The Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen said on Wednesday it had  thwarted an attack on a Saudi oil tanker over the weekend by Houthi  fighters near the Red Sea port of Hodeidah.
2962 2018-01-10 19:28:19 Do you have to keep it full of BAR oil like a chainsaw so ya dont burn it up like when your working with a big log?
2963 2018-01-10 19:28:17 Christianity suffered a great set back when prosperity snake oil salesmen are accepted into the fold to proliferate. It started as a joke & they used the tv to convince many Christians into their brand of heresy. There's no turning back now from the epidemic

2975 2018-01-10 19:27:16 How much does Florida being exempt from the drilling plan have to do with Mar A Lago being on the golf coast? I doubt Trump wants to look at an oil rig from his resort.
2976 2018-01-10 19:26:56 Congress n Communist govts ruling there simultaneously turning a blind eye only to keep power n loot . It isn't surprising to see there's absolutely no development except in high literacy rate that too proving entire leadership sold out to gulf oil 
2977 2018-01-10 19:26:53 So you are suing the five major oil companies for their role in climate change?? I hope this (losing) lawsuit is funded by an outside group and not NYC taxpayers. We have more pressing issues than a virtue signaling, expensive lawsuit.
2978 2018-01-10 19:26:43 today's inventory Refined product UP both Gasoline & Heating Oil, why do you think?

3001 2018-01-10 19:25:21 Until then, but note that it is only now that poor oil host nations have started to clamour for independence and local content control. Meanwhile the article didn't preclude other sources of energy, but emphasises that we have to look inwards to look ahead

3004 2018-01-10 19:24:59 I can see nothing wrong in your decision. Tourism drives the Florida economy and an oil rig would spoil the view & possibly cause a coastal disaster. Seems rather logical to me.

3007 2018-01-10 19:24:47 It's easy to sue Big Oil, but does New York have an alternative, using 1000Watt/m2 fossil energy now? The question is can Green Energy deliver? I fear not!

3017 2018-01-10 19:23:49 And will the levy go directly to good causes or go to pay for the supermarket to print their advertising on the  bags. Why no plain alternatives? Why no paper alternatives? Is it because plastic bags are an embarrassing necessity of the oil industry?
3018 2018-01-10 19:23:47 Though I’m not an NDP follower, neither am I filled with angst about their focus on social issues. They’ve had huge hurdles in oil prices tanking and in overcoming 44 years of entrenchment, for which I can give NDs grace. But the UCP outrage and outright lying appalls me #ableg
3019 2018-01-10 19:23:43 Hopefully, they can step in before we hand land to Big Oil for next to nothing and watch beautiful landscapes turned into a lifeless wasteland
3020 2018-01-10 19:23:42 Skin the rapists alive, then drown them in kerosine oil, and then set them on fire!
3021 2018-01-10 19:23:41 lastnight my pillow cases were smelling like downy . . now they smell like cantu & coconut oil  natural hair problems
3022 2018-01-10 19:23:38 We divested from all banks oil and munitions.  Only good citizen stocks.  Our portfolio does BETTER now.

3025 2018-01-10 19:23:33 Trump Stupidly pulled out of TPP and Paris Accord.....now word on the street thinks he’ll pull out of NAFTA.....A great many states will suffer as a result and those that think it’ll help Labor are just wrong! Agriculture, Oil, Auto Manufacturing, so many jobs will suffer!
3026 2018-01-10 19:23:28 I told the guy doing our oil change lmao I can't wait for the next one. And no sugar o/

3029 2018-01-10 19:23:14 honestly all chips are better in them. baby potatoes coated in oil and whatever herbs are real good in the fryer too! i usually just cook whatever i'd usually cook in the oven (without raw chicken breasts or fish but coated and wrapped in tinfoil would work actually)
3030 2018-01-10 19:23:08 
3031 2018-01-10 19:23:08 Anyone have any tips on how to mask the smell from Black Castor Oil ? 

I don’t want to be walking around smelling like this oil all day 

Maybe a scented hair spray or somethinggggg .. lmk
3032 2018-01-10 19:23:01 The drilling has already happened the oil company s just need to uncap the wells. Oil independent s is most important
3033 2018-01-10 19:22:58 Eliminating State & Local tax deduction, oil drilling of the west coast, not popular in CA.
3034 2018-01-10 19:22:50 Thanks! The closest is in Flint though, which might be a bit far for an oil change 
3035 2018-01-10 19:22:50 @cascinaverdesol I love your olive oil. How can I purchase here in United States?
3036 2018-01-10 19:22:46 oil

3038 2018-01-10 19:22:32 Hey, In NJ we don’t even pump our own gas! Now you want us to drill our own oil?
3039 2018-01-10 19:22:28 Chris, listen to me. I need you to rescue two hostages from an underwater oil field. Agent Sherry Birkin... ...and Jake Muller. He's Albert Wesker's son.

3042 2018-01-10 19:22:15 I'm really happy i went with a double treadle option. The wheel came with an allen wrench and an oil thing (i ordered another bc i lost it some time in the last few months) and I like how much I can tweak and maintain it myself, but I don't think that's wheel-specific.

3049 2018-01-10 19:21:45 i wonder if it would work tho cause isnt the oil for the diffusers a thinner substance?
3050 2018-01-10 19:21:42 Sundinqanda! The sermon will probably be like "Jesus walked on water, we're are floating on it, anything is possible my sister! Open yourself up for blessings!"

And you know how many have sought anointing oil for marriage! 
3051 2018-01-10 19:21:38 Jersey is the one state we should allow off shore drilling. The armpit of the US could do with a little oil spill. Might improve the oil slick from the hair on the jersey shore
3052 2018-01-10 19:21:25 My mom received a package and was like like “oh it’s my weed” I was like naaa and she goes yea look and it was a cannabis oil lol 
3053 2018-01-10 19:21:17 I never learn, when it comes to class introductions I always mention that I work in oil and gas and my classmates go on and immediately think Im a stupid, hillbilly redneck. It's a surefire way to not get a good group for projects.

3062 2018-01-10 19:20:11 Did you know Puglia and Calabria (South Italy) produce 68% of Italy’s olive oil? Tuscany produces 2%. Remember that next time you pick up Italian EVOO at the supermarket. (Facts from updated @USDA Foreign Agricultural Service) #evoo #oliveoil #southitaly
3063 2018-01-10 19:20:10 It’s a warehouse for like building things for oil fields 
3064 2018-01-10 19:20:08 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
3065 2018-01-10 19:20:07 Watching professional chefs cook with oil so close to their fingers... cómo no se están quemando las manos?
3066 2018-01-10 19:20:06 I often use oil filled radiators I had in my old house. Just take them in and keep them running till the jobs done.
3067 2018-01-10 19:20:06  it's soooo expensive like..$80 mask, $75 tiny bottle of oil
3068 2018-01-10 19:19:59 I just shower early in the day like 3hrs before my shift and use 1/2 lotion 1/2 coconut oil all over. It soaks in by the time I have to I go work so I'm never ashy and never making the pole slippery. I do a lot of tricks so I need my grip.
3069 2018-01-10 19:19:54 I've started using rose hip oil for my supah pink and blobby face skin and I smell like every granny's Imperial Leather soap bars.
3070 2018-01-10 19:19:47 @jamieoliver had another fab meal in Jamie’s Covent Garden today but struggled to find Slimming World compliant foods. Ever thought of an option not cooked in butter, flour or olive oil?
3071 2018-01-10 19:19:39 esp given how expensive gas has been relative to oil. Oil was double what it is now and I don't remember gas being that much more expensive. Even taking into account tax change.
3072 2018-01-10 19:19:27 Yeah they were wanting £100 off me for an oil change. Went to them and the cut it by half price
3073 2018-01-10 19:19:19 Senator Markey, Please tell @SecretaryZinke that Mass doesn’t want our shores covered with oil! Why does a @GOP state get a pass?! They should all go in his home state!

3075 2018-01-10 19:19:10 Not sure - is it oil?
3076 2018-01-10 19:19:03 just passed a blacked out Escalade. all it’s license plate said was “OIL”
3077 2018-01-10 19:18:48 But really do this... make this a art space and do you art in your beautiful oil fog room

3081 2018-01-10 19:18:36 I think that for this to be made "true", you've got to make the claim that BTC's utility will be much less than that of gold and oil.  I think the utility of BTC is still yet to be fully realized, so a bit premature to make this claim.  3/X
3082 2018-01-10 19:18:08 Problem is CBD oil is not legal in all 50 states they have it is a schedule one just like medical marijuana cannabis and it’s sad that something that can help millions is still technically not legal
3083 2018-01-10 19:17:43 @realDonaldTrump is right when he claims that China has the power to hit the North Korean economy hard. Yet an oil embargo would mean that China has abandoned its ally in #Pyongyang an ally that provides a buffer
against the presence of US troops on its border.
3084 2018-01-10 19:17:36 You must hair softer curls then. I oil my hair with jojoba, Argan or olive oil and it's like there's nothing in my hair the next morning. My hair just drinks up the shit 
3085 2018-01-10 19:17:33 Where does plastic come from? The majority of products have some oil by-product. So I'm not wrong. Over the past 200 years people have been living longer and better lives despite the oil being used. The oil has helped people live better lives.
3086 2018-01-10 19:17:33 Oil me up!
3087 2018-01-10 19:17:16 Exfoliate your face, neck and hands with a mixture of baking soda and olive oil. It is very gentle, and keeps skin very soft and smooth.
3088 2018-01-10 19:17:13 Waiting for an oil change and a door latch replacement due to safety recall. Tonight I keep jumping to Colonia in #EliteDangerous for #ExpeditionEnigma. The dealership has comfortable chairs.
3089 2018-01-10 19:17:12 I hope you're feeling better. I have a ritual. Dark house, crank the ac, extra dark french press of coffee, peppermint and lavender oil behind the ears and on the temples, XL glass of very lemony ice water. A nap if poss. No idea what yours are/would be, but I hope you find it.
3090 2018-01-10 19:17:11 @realDonaldTrump Hey Don...you know that off shore drilling order you signed a few days ago? I heard today that you’ve now excluded Florida. Is that because you didn’t want to see oil rigs off Mar-a-Lago?
3091 2018-01-10 19:17:05 Almost everything smells terrible to me right now, except French fries that I still haven't eaten any of, and now the lobby of this oil change place??

MY LIFE IS SO WEIRD RIGHT NOW

It's the legislature who decides how we fund govt. They have refused to implement an income tax and refused to remove oil tax credits.

3097 2018-01-10 19:16:32 And if BTC (like gold and oil) don't replace fiat money then I don't see how the leap is made that people buying are only waiting for other people to buy it.  Is that how gold and oil work?  Why would BTC be different? 2/X
3098 2018-01-10 19:16:24 I’ll oil it up when my hair is feeling dry, and then I’ll co-wash it, put in my leave in etc and that’s it

3107 2018-01-10 19:15:07 And how we pay for it is companies dumping hazard waste in our water ways, clean air a thing of the past. Oil drilling off our coasts causing massive oil spills in the ocean. Pipelines (that have already burst) on sacred land. The cost to clean up will outweigh any savings.

3112 2018-01-10 19:14:45 @realDonaldTrump says no offshore oil rigs in Florida.  Why? Oil rigs would block the view from Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s faux-luxury swamp ghetto.
3113 2018-01-10 19:14:43 the lack of discussion is because whenever jan 18th is here and the oil contract isn't out there is nothing to discuss...
3114 2018-01-10 19:14:29 The analogy he says about the early BTC holders garnering more wealth seems analogous to the early gold finders of the gold rush or oil discoverers ... If this is accurate, then do/did Gold and Oil discoveries only result in "redistribution" ?... 1/X
3115 2018-01-10 19:14:26 Yet if we don't drill it another country will. So you would rather other countries drill all the oil with lower environmental standards than the US. So then we still have to rely on other countries for oil instead of being energy independent. Tell me how that logic works.
3116 2018-01-10 19:14:25 Cut me a break...Without those #oil companies & the #by-products produced from that oil, where would #NYC & everyone else in this country be - riding horses, thatching our roofs, wearing leather shoes (not sneakers/tennis shoes), etc. etc.

Plus, increased funding will not cost taxpayers a penny because it's paid for with drilling fees from oil and gas companies.
3127 2018-01-10 19:13:24 HE HATES THESE OIL CANS!
3128 2018-01-10 19:13:20 It amazes me the Unionist press rant on and on about Oil price drop, 
Perhaps fair enough to an extent, 
But when it rises to $69 a barrel we do not hear a peep from them 
Strange that!
3129 2018-01-10 19:13:12 More oil is released naturally than all man made disasters combined Blah blah blah please re-elect me so I can help immigrants and African Americans and umm oh yeah poor people and and of crap you know what I mean Just vote for me I’m a serious person

3132 2018-01-10 19:13:03 Thanks, Senator.  The current oil prices do not justify extreme drilling practices!
Keep the pressure on your peers to  be responsible custodians of our environment.

3134 2018-01-10 19:12:47 I got my first ticket today and I need a oil change then my car payment due 
3135 2018-01-10 19:12:43 Just seeking transparent, honest appraisals of the merits and limits of choices. If it is aspirational, great. That was a nice flash of clarity. Not there in the rhetoric around the oil lawsuits. If it's *symbolic*, for instance, fine.
3136 2018-01-10 19:12:38 No carbon is from bad gas or running rich for to long. Oil usage is normal for All Subarus bad pcv system esp over 100K
3137 2018-01-10 19:12:31 We lived through that with the BP oil spill. I am not suggesting that oil is wonderful. I am saying that oil rigs all along the shoreline is reactionary. The states can decide where, and if, they appear.
3138 2018-01-10 19:12:28 You go girl! We all know Big Oil makes the really big bucks when they spill oil everywhere!!

3141 2018-01-10 19:12:15 Trump properties have pregnant Russian women living in them so they're children can be born in America. Trump also exempted Florida from off shore drilling. Viewing oil platforms would be distressing for patrons of Trump properties to see.
3142 2018-01-10 19:12:14 I'd like to write a how-to adult manual on all the things you don't learn growing up but everyone automatically assumes you know. 

1. How to check your oil. 
2. You should get your oil changed every few months.
3. Also have your tires rotated and check other fluids.
3143 2018-01-10 19:12:14 do you think this is unlikely to pop up? resistance at 56
3144 2018-01-10 19:12:05 Last week the Trump Admin announced their plan to dismantle a decades-old ban on oil & gas drilling on shorelines across the nation. For over 40 years I’ve opposed drilling off the CA coast, understanding the risks of drilling & knowing we had to move to a new energy future.

3146 2018-01-10 19:11:57 I thought scrooge's thing was mineral rights. Wasn't he always exploring exotic locales looking for diamonds and oil and, oh i don't know ducktonium?
3147 2018-01-10 19:11:53 i wanted to wear my tracer leggings to the dealership to get my oil changed and half way there i violently remembered that my car is also covered in overwatch decals and now i’M MAD

3151 2018-01-10 19:11:26 Joe Oliver, the guy who left in a huge deficit, then lounged about at the #FAKELAKE in his riding! Only solution he had, was giving more money to big oil in his #CORPORATEWELFARECHEQUES
3152 2018-01-10 19:11:22 Overbought based on "record" long positions in the futures market, "real-time" RSI at highest since 2011, DSI highest since 2012, oil stocks / sector ETFs peaking. Nothing subjective about it being overbought, only thing subjective is your view based on nothing it seems. LOL!
3153 2018-01-10 19:11:20 I’ve seen a lot on Facebook about homemade hair oil recipes, does it really work on very thin hair?
3154 2018-01-10 19:11:15 How honest are American history books with the theft of Mexican land and our current immigration issues? How much gold and oil were taken?
3155 2018-01-10 19:11:12 Mr President please check oil/ gas prices. Don’t let them get out of hand. I smell a rat. Oil companies are notorious for raising prices at every opportunity.
3156 2018-01-10 19:11:07 I will get you some stuff but Fenty match stix are matte so that’ll be better for you. Won’t be too dry because you’re naturally oil. Finish is better too

What does Dubai produce other than oil? There are so many nations that have deliberately refused to produce anything while converting their Human and natural Resources to capital generating avenues. That narrative is stale please
3180 2018-01-10 19:08:36 Again, I was not speaking of "green credentials", rather, disrespect in the desire to drill in environmentally sensitive areas;  no country — aside from perhaps Russia — has been so aggressive in opening up the Arctic to oil exploration.
3181 2018-01-10 19:08:33 It can be The Mar-a-lago Oil Party of 2018!  @SierraClub @greenpeaceusa  - any ideas on how to “celebrate” the construction of oil platforms around Mar-a-lago???

3200 2018-01-10 19:07:18 Of course not. 1) California didn't vote for Trump 2) Trump doesn't want Jerry Brown to run for Senate so he isn't trying to make him look good 3) No one with the money has put an oil drilling rig immediately offshore of his properties in CA (unlike his "Winter White House")

3216 2018-01-10 19:05:49 On weekly basis, we rarely see a change in the production number of NGLs plant liquids. Now oil is down substantially, and NGLs are up almost by the same amount.  Also, read the EIA statement on benchmarking.

3220 2018-01-10 19:05:21 Must be new to California, there are nearly a dozen offshore operations already between oil and gas and there is already a ban on new leases off California and there has been for a long time. Also welcome to California.
3221 2018-01-10 19:05:21 They should be suing the nation state oil companies too, right? They’ve produced the vast majority of the hydrocarbons humans have consumed. What’s the matter, NY? Afraid to sue Saudi Arabia? Iran? Iraq? Venezuela?
3222 2018-01-10 19:05:21 The city has not specified an amount of damages it wants from oil companies. @BilldeBlasio says it would be in the billions. Any money recovered would go toward climate measures.

3225 2018-01-10 19:05:05 Who cares WHY they won’t allow it?! Just happy this is the outcome. After the BP oil spill several years ago, most of us Floridians are glad there won’t be new drilling.
3226 2018-01-10 19:04:54 Glad I know how to do my own oil change so I don’t have to overpay someone to do it for me

3234 2018-01-10 19:03:44 That’s cool. The oil companies can just raise the price of gasoline for New Yorkers.
3235 2018-01-10 19:03:26 Well I guess I'm not changing my oil today

3244 2018-01-10 19:02:08 I just can not stop laughing. You are suing oil companies for causing hurricanes that damage NYC? I hope your lawyers are working on contingency, otherwise you will be getting sued for using taxpayer dollars on frivolous lawsuits.

3247 2018-01-10 19:01:54 In case you haven't noticed, no coastal state wants to allow for offshore drilling.

Got a pipe around?
Here, I got something for you to stick in it:
Not only is it damaging to the environment and tourism, it would create way more supply than demand, damaging oil company profits.

3265 2018-01-10 19:00:17 Specifically, Trump is allowing coastal drilling to keep the Koch Brothers happy.  They want to take us backwards - coal burning and oil drilling everywhere.  They also pay republicans to vote certain ways on bills.  It’s disgusting.

3272 2018-01-10 18:59:59 @TerryMcAuliffe  I strongly oppose  offshore drilling off the VA coast. #1 We don't need the oil. #2 any oil spill would devastate the economy in VA beach. A risk that is not worth taking. Let alone the impact to our environment and the health of the Chesapeake Please speak out
3273 2018-01-10 18:59:59 I’m getting an oil change today and i don’t wanna hear all the extra shit.
3274 2018-01-10 18:59:57 So basically you just told Cuba they can have all the oil off the coast of Florida. Just because we won't drill there doesn't mean others won't drill that oil. And their standards won't be as high as ours. So if they have a spill or accident it is you I will blame
3275 2018-01-10 18:59:56 If olive oil comes from olives, where does baby oil come from?
3276 2018-01-10 18:59:50 Time for the oil companies to stop sending gas to NYC.  Let’s see how they move that many people without petro.
3277 2018-01-10 18:59:45 It helps for in between washes. You’re not supposed to wash your hair every day. I can go three days without washing, then it is questionable. It soaks up the oil and makes it smell nice.

3283 2018-01-10 18:59:06 That’s what I’m thinking. I got one of those oil pens and NOTHING man
3284 2018-01-10 18:58:54 How so? NRA OFFERS $$ to gov't officials including Democrat. NRA doesn't force them to take it. Right? Same as health care, insurance, car manufacturers, oil. You may not like @POTUS but, as of today, what is wrong? SK and NK are talking. Dow is up. Jobs are up. DACA at Congress
3285 2018-01-10 18:58:52 I don't want more oil platforms off our California coast. There are enough oil rigs. I like that Senator Feinstein is making this a priority because the current leadership in Washington DC does not appear to care about the environment. 1/2
3286 2018-01-10 18:58:52 Coconut oil is essential for such situations
3287 2018-01-10 18:58:49 Oil is a beauty

3289 2018-01-10 18:58:45 Dammit, I was just out collecting plastic bottles to collect my free oil.  Guess I’ll just throw them back in the ocean where I found them.
3290 2018-01-10 18:58:45 Should the major oil companies embargo New York City in response?
3291 2018-01-10 18:58:44 Or the loss of soil quality... or ocean acidification... or species loss... or deforestation... or nuclear waste... or gender-bending chemicals... or oil leakages... or the proliferation of plastics... or the destruction caused by mining... or #fracking... And what else?
3292 2018-01-10 18:58:38 Dear Sec Zinke - when governors ask for exemptions on oil drilling - they really mean you should resign immediately you buffoon
3293 2018-01-10 18:58:24 Oil companies should stop selling gas and heating oil in NYC.
3294 2018-01-10 18:58:15 Lol oil at 120 probably had a lot more buyers than oil @50
3295 2018-01-10 18:58:13 I said oil and gas. Oil and gas emissions are UP.  Coal emissions are down. When are you going to lobby hard for a carbon tax? Embrace CCS? Lobby for, instead of against methane rules. Lobby for low carbon fuel standards?
3296 2018-01-10 18:58:09 There will be some improvement in the oil sector but will not be booming due to quality, transportation, and several other factors that affect exports and profits #yeg #raeforecast #maketherightmove

3298 2018-01-10 18:58:01 How is this "proof" due to offshore oil drilling and production?
3299 2018-01-10 18:57:57 I'm going to personally stick a DeWalt in a dune just to prove you wrong. It's people like you who'd have our grandchildren bowing to Wahhabists for more oil.
3300 2018-01-10 18:57:56 Of course they won't drill for undersea oil in Florida; a spill might damage Mir-A-Lago. Trump would have to find a new place to peddle his influence of that happened.
3301 2018-01-10 18:57:54 They aren't even trying to hide the evil anymore. Next President needs to put 30 oil rigs just offshore of Maralago. They don't even need to drill. Just sit there and ruin the view. Yes this is just how petty I've become in the past year.
3302 2018-01-10 18:57:50 No chance the oil belongs to whoever the SNP say it does..... doncha know..........
3303 2018-01-10 18:57:49 Me enamore de la wuacha de la oil
3304 2018-01-10 18:57:44 House paint with oil paints, has it worked for anyone else? Cos it certainly ain't working for me. Ran out of white so resorted to gaff paint
3305 2018-01-10 18:57:35 There are oil fields all over California. There are also wind farms, nuclear reactors, and solar power stations. Eventually, there will be no oil fields because fossil fuel usage is killing the planet. There is no rational argument for offshore drilling.
3306 2018-01-10 18:57:29 @realDonaldTrump Why is Florida exempt from offshore drilling? Nobody wants ugly oil spills creating dead zones in our oceans and bays and that includes New York, California and every other state bordering the ocean.
3307 2018-01-10 18:57:13 I think Trump is punishing Feinstein by allowing oil rigs to be placed on the California coast.
3308 2018-01-10 18:57:12 Leave in R85, Shea butter R180 & oil R150
3309 2018-01-10 18:57:11 Right I really hope this Neem oil works. The smell is horrid. But I need clear skin!!
3310 2018-01-10 18:57:10 I just use shea moisture coconut oil
3311 2018-01-10 18:57:03 Can y'all please put some oil in these mixed babies head, please 
3312 2018-01-10 18:56:45 @JerryBrownGov  they have barred Florida coast from oil drilling because their coastline supports tourism.  This is also true of California.  I hope your're fighting Trump on this BS.  What's good for CA is good for FL! @SenKamalaHarris
3313 2018-01-10 18:56:30 yup, damn that old white crone Obama. He said he put down enough oil pipelines to circle the earth. But at least he stopped Keystone for a bit....
3314 2018-01-10 18:56:23 What does a mouse drink?? 
Oil because he squeaks 
3315 2018-01-10 18:56:21 @PurpulHair how much is your leave in conditioner , Shea butter and oil?
3316 2018-01-10 18:56:17 Operating nuclear is cheaper than coal and way cheaper than oil.
3317 2018-01-10 18:56:17 Manning's treason warranted a lifetime trip to a tough gulag, helping drill for oil on the North Slope in Alaska. Gitmo is too good for him/her/it.
3318 2018-01-10 18:56:08 Agreed. There was a long time CAD and oil weren’t correlating but perhaps the gears are rotating in the right direction, signalling a top in oil. Possibly 
3319 2018-01-10 18:55:59 Another waste of time like coal oil drilling marijuana laws and wall
3320 2018-01-10 18:55:57 What, we suddenly see we don't need the oil, or someone doesn't want to see oil rigs in front of their golfcourse?
3321 2018-01-10 18:55:45 with $ or with € or with oil wich one enough for heapy World ?
3322 2018-01-10 18:55:39 Didn't know there were oil sands in SE Alberta. I love it when elected officials stand up for their constituents.

Our worst oil spill was because of offshore drilling. #ProtectOurCoast
3329 2018-01-10 18:55:09 People pray for a cake, god gives them the batter, oil, eggs, icing, a pan, and an oven, people don’t get the recipe and get frustrated and quit. That’s real
3330 2018-01-10 18:55:06 A clip 'round lug oil from thi mam.
3331 2018-01-10 18:55:05 Spent over $400 just to get tires and an oil change to get me through the next few weeks to where I have to do another $1200 worth of work 
3332 2018-01-10 18:55:02 #NewYorkCity sues oil companies? The Oil companies should just say, "Fine" and stop selling oil there. Fuck them.
3333 2018-01-10 18:55:02 California Soon to have offshore oil spills. Thanks Trump.
3334 2018-01-10 18:54:57 Laying in bed while cramping makes it a lot worse. That’s why when woman are in labor all they want to is walk around and it is also highly recommended to sustain the pain. Trust me, I’ve been there. So working out makes a lot sense.Take cannabis oil if you can. It works wonders
3335 2018-01-10 18:54:53 Well that would be bearish if oil they got out of a refined barrel of oil is gas and diesel.  But now that’s not the case now is it?
3336 2018-01-10 18:54:48 As I’m shoving my face with french fries... We’re talking about our healthy eating she talking about no fried foods we got to use peanut oil to cook our food with, only eating fruits, vegetables, fish, and meal plans...Lord she serious! And I’m still eating fries 
3337 2018-01-10 18:54:41 Same story  again bitching bears going short without a meaningful Sell Signal using micro timeframe. Think an Oil tanker can turn on a dime think again
3338 2018-01-10 18:54:23 Sitting here watching my oil be changed by a guy smoking... hoping he doesn’t blow this place up lol
3339 2018-01-10 18:54:20 Good job senator. Our coastline is too precious to risk another catastrophe like in the gulf, or the Exxon Valdez or another of the huge oil spills that are going to happen if drilling is allowed!
3340 2018-01-10 18:54:20 Coconut oil in my coffee
3341 2018-01-10 18:54:17 I agree! Most of them are harsh and completely strip the natural oils from your skin. That’s why I always carry a tiny bottle of Olive Oil with me, instantly softens cuticles and hands not to mention very nourishing.
3342 2018-01-10 18:54:17 todos orando para que el oil no se desplome!! Lo que hay que hacer es ahorrar, reducir pasivos en USDs, diversificar la economía incentivando la industria manufacturera, agro y turismo.

3345 2018-01-10 18:53:58 I just found out that many essential oils are toxic to your cats. If you have an oil diffuser please make sure it is safe for your kitties!! 
3346 2018-01-10 18:53:55 So... my mom found my oil and now she's asking 173828282 questions lmfaooo
3347 2018-01-10 18:53:54 C'est pas vraiment Noêl dans le 11ème : + 7%+8% pour le gaz - Les PV  qui passent de 17 à 50 Euros - le Gas Oil +11  Cts d'euros le litre ... Et en fouillant un peu les impots locaux ect   ... Merçi à Mr le Millionnaire Hulot , Mme Hidalgo , Mr Macron , qui défends les modestes ?
3348 2018-01-10 18:53:51 So recently the GOP let a tax on oil companies expire.  The tax funded cleanups in case of spills (example Exxon Valdez).  How many citizens don't care?  How many are saying the oil companies EARNED their money and get to keep it?  Average Americans can pay for cleanups right?
3349 2018-01-10 18:53:50 & Courtois & errrr Salah & errrr Dybala! So unless they’ve suddenly struck oil under the Bernabau it’s all a load of bollocks!
3350 2018-01-10 18:53:42 As I’m putting oil in my car, outside of work sits the schizophrenic homeless lady singing a song repeating, “shift in the atmosphere”. Schizo people have higher levels of DMT than a normal person; which that shapes your consciousness. Maybe she knows something we don’t 
3351 2018-01-10 18:53:39 Was just looking at photos from Sapelo this morning. The inevitability of oil drilling is a major spill.
3352 2018-01-10 18:53:27 burning the midnight oil?
3353 2018-01-10 18:53:10 There has to be some agenda to derail governments development agenda.  So that government is busy in these things and the development  work is not done.  That's all.  Who do you think goes and put oil in court.  Who all has lost so much after Nap came to power.  The Dallas.
3354 2018-01-10 18:53:04 HE WILL HAPPILY RETIRE AS A MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR OWNER OF A PASS-THROUGH CONSULTING FIRM HEDGING BETS ON OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING.
3355 2018-01-10 18:53:02 Nah...Hell of a lot of oil and good old clean coal left to use up! Yee haa...
3356 2018-01-10 18:52:46 As per fireworks, never saw the thrill. However I was blowing up real explosives as a means to sell them to eager oil company engineers. Big bang baby, it's a gas, gas, gas..
3357 2018-01-10 18:52:39 Not just individuals but institutions too ie pension funds etc Inflationary pressures likely to come from shortages in certain commodities or poor supply ie housing A weak pound will import inflation especially oil products which of course would feed into transport etc

3362 2018-01-10 18:52:07 This is meant to distract. Deblasio will hurt workers in the oil industry.  Layoffs on the horizon. This is a big baby move. Sorry.
3363 2018-01-10 18:52:06 I don't say this lightly, but Brian Sullivan @SullyCNBC is the smartest, most intuitive,  and quickest thinker on television plus extremely entertaining.  Too bad no award for this category, but Sullivan would win. Keeps it light, keeps it funny, and no idea what direction. @cnbc
3364 2018-01-10 18:52:01 Mayor DeBlasio also suing five major oil companies for lying about their impact on climate change.  Boston should do the same! #MaPoli

3366 2018-01-10 18:51:57 Monoi oil feels really good to me! It’s a bit hydrating as well!
3367 2018-01-10 18:51:51 Damn maybe you just a flower guy ... but I've seen ppl throw up on thc oil... go to the blazers cup
3368 2018-01-10 18:51:44 So, without trying to sound negative, this could be the same result? My question is .....does this mean it’s LOTS of oil if it’s a repeat of last month with produced nothing...albeit as expected for KL1/2
3369 2018-01-10 18:51:39 Oil natural gas nuclear coal have been frauding manipulating for a hundred years. Our chances of survival are slim BC of what humans have done to earth

3376 2018-01-10 18:51:04 Bullshit.  You're exempting Florida because they voted for your boss.  Washington and Oregon have coastal tourism as well, not to mention fishing industries.  The oil and gas potential in the PNW is insignificant compared to Florida.
3377 2018-01-10 18:51:01 I've been using lavender oil on a blemish, and my skin texture is noticeably prettier in that spot... even with a zit 
3378 2018-01-10 18:50:53 All of these sound great but strange I don't see avo listed. I love soft poached egg in half an avo, dash of cayenne pepper and olive oil and maybe grated hard cheddar 
3379 2018-01-10 18:50:53 just realizing im eating the very same recipe (plus oil) that i made some cosplay props out of
3380 2018-01-10 18:50:50 Car feel brand new after a oil change and tire rotation though 
3381 2018-01-10 18:50:41 I need an oil change and some more.
3382 2018-01-10 18:50:39 Spared?!?!  Just using that word implies the danger all coastal states are facing thanks to trump’s greedy oil buddies.
3383 2018-01-10 18:50:29 Climate activist Naomi Klein says there have been suits before against oil companies over climate change, but big firms have been able to overwhelm small-time plaintiffs. NYC is bigger and different. "Bullying isn't going to work here."
3384 2018-01-10 18:50:27 also, a lawsuit against Exxon, Shell, BP & other major oil companies for the damages caused by climate change sounds like fire to me.
3385 2018-01-10 18:50:24 Temperatures increased .8°C since 1880. There are many factors that play into the earths temperature change. What scientific evidence do you have that pinpoints these oil companies impact on this rise?
3386 2018-01-10 18:50:24 The question isn’t should we drill at certain locations but when. By waiting the price of oil will be over $120 dollars a barrel and the technology safeguards will be so much better.
3387 2018-01-10 18:50:19 Well i hope the oil companies oblige and let it play out in court. Me thinks it won't go the way NYC wants it to.
3388 2018-01-10 18:50:16 Trump doesn’t want oil drilling off Florida, it might ruin the view at Mar-A-Lago

3408 2018-01-10 18:48:56 Oil heating is just the worst.  Filled up my tank today for $680. No gas in my area so options are limited.  I do this every month in the winter.

3413 2018-01-10 18:48:44 Check how much oil and sittn dem put in it, all sugar. I was surprised
3414 2018-01-10 18:48:29 You need to press it first to get the water out, I cut it into bits and then pressed it between 2 chopping boards for like 1.5 hours! Then coated it in oil, bit of soy sauce then roasted it. If you mixed some cornflour in it would go crispier but I didn’t have any!
3415 2018-01-10 18:48:25 Oh FFS, why would he want to kiss someone he's not attracted to? She's certainly no bloody oil painting is she?
3416 2018-01-10 18:48:09 @maddow I'm not sure why this no offshore oil drilling in Florida is such a mystery? Have we forgotten where Donald's Winter White House is?
3417 2018-01-10 18:47:56 Very apt sir!
Here, we are battling with severe fuel scarcity at the moment...a country with one of the largest crude oil export in Africa. Suffering in the midst of plenty!

3420 2018-01-10 18:47:54 Realist shit I ever read: “People pray for the cake. Then God gives them the batter, eggs, oil, icing, a pan, an oven, they get get frustrated and leave the kitchen.” Let that sink. Sometimes you have everything right in front of you, but how bad do you want it ?
3421 2018-01-10 18:47:43 Itakua poa sana vikikaza weka oil
3422 2018-01-10 18:47:37 Sorry to hear you've not understood all the points I've made. I'm saying that the powers Scotland already have are not being used to further change the Oil Revenue being collected down south in Westminster.
3423 2018-01-10 18:47:34 New York sues big oil companies over climate change...
3424 2018-01-10 18:47:27 Meet the new Diet Coke flavors aimed at millennials: Rosé, avocado toast, and beard oil.
3425 2018-01-10 18:47:14 There is a lot of Tom$uckery going on with these 4 products imo... OIL GOLD SPX NG.  Let's see if anything actually changes this year from 2017
3426 2018-01-10 18:47:07 This day in history
1901 Gusher signals start of U.S. oil industry 
1776  North Carolina governor calls on Loyalists to combat rebels  
1861 William Seward named Secretary of State         
1989 Cuban troops begin withdrawal from Angola
3427 2018-01-10 18:46:57 Swimming in a bucket of dirty oil, you should have seen him on Sunday evening when he reappeared.
3428 2018-01-10 18:46:53 i have the oil blotting powder and it’s bomb 
3429 2018-01-10 18:46:47 and yet oil production was reported to fall 293,000 bopd.  That combined with the 50,000 bopd (which makes sense in light of the new STEO whether you think EIA is on target or not) seems like a really big "freeze off" number.
3430 2018-01-10 18:46:46 The last sentence is the most crucial. We pass laws in Oregon to keep our state beautiful and environmentally ahead of almost any state to the east of us for this very reason. We don't want the possibility of an oil spill destroying our coastline.
3431 2018-01-10 18:46:36 Rhode Island doesn't want any oil drilling on their coastlines either. We don't want to swim in oil!!! Just because he wants to keep his Rich donors happy and fill their pockets. I hope senator White House is speaking up with you.
3432 2018-01-10 18:46:35 Have you checked the price of heating oil in New England?   what about the electricity provider rates....only thing they've done is go up, up up!
3433 2018-01-10 18:46:34 News Flash! This country is awash in oil. So much so that we're actually exporting it. There is zero need to endanger our coastlines and habitats by offshore drilling. This change in policy is a gift from Trump and Tillerson to the oil industry, and a punishment for blue states.
3434 2018-01-10 18:46:25 You know me so they have to be Certified Organic essential oils. Especially like a blend of 1 part Citronella 3 parts Lemongrass and 3 parts Lavender for keeping mosquitoes away, and freshening the air. Usually need 1/4 - 1/2 oz of oil per lb of wax, but can make stronger
3435 2018-01-10 18:46:12 With Shahana and Mousumi at Indian Oil Programme..... Nice moments
3436 2018-01-10 18:46:08 #climatechange This a historic day. New York City is divesting from it's fossil fuel company investments AND has announced that it is to sue the big oil and gas companies for the damage they are doing to the environment
3437 2018-01-10 18:45:55 Quede tan traumada con los "unicorns oil"que voy a comprarme todos, alv me vlv.
3438 2018-01-10 18:45:55 We don’t need more oil extraction. We need more renewable substitutes and adjuncts. The GOP $$$$ is all-in clinging to the dirty fossil past & holding back the clean future.
3439 2018-01-10 18:45:49 Dr Mintz has taken us through a wide ranging look at World and the Alberta economy. The world economy is ticking along very nicely but it will also see interest rate increases. Oil/Nat Gas prices will remain volatile, especially with US shale oil and gas exports. #RAEforecast
3440 2018-01-10 18:45:36 Has anyone gotten eyelash extensions in queens anywhere? This castor oil takin too long
3441 2018-01-10 18:45:34 &fact that Mar a lago sits on ocean, doesn't it? Of course oil spils travel so the rest of states on oceans could still get em. Speaking of water..there IS a BLUE WAVE coming 2018/2020...what DO can be fixed...the money the Rs have wasted in last 20 yrs could've fixed alot! SAD!

3444 2018-01-10 18:45:28 You do know your savior most likely used Cannabis Oil to anoint and heal right??
3445 2018-01-10 18:45:25 I need to learn how to paint with oil. Also acrylic can SMD.
3446 2018-01-10 18:45:20 If you are a Blue state you’re fucked. NJ relies heavily on tourism to its beaches, but we lean democratic so I expect oil rigs to be as commonplace as boardwalks.
3447 2018-01-10 18:45:12 EIA weekly on crude production: This week’s domestic crude oil production estimate incorporates a re-benchmarking that raised estimated volumes by less than 50,000 barrels per day. #OOTT
3448 2018-01-10 18:45:12 What about the members of @berkeleyantifa and @followbamn who were posting online on their blogs and discords for months about pouring cement on the train tracks of oil and natural gas carrying commercial trains in the NorthWest United States. Is that a big deal?
3449 2018-01-10 18:44:54 Getting my baby Venus’ oil changed, tires rotated and balanced, mufflers deleted and a new sound system today 
3450 2018-01-10 18:44:50 Oil is trading at highs not seen since December 2014, shortly after the market tanked as OPEC refused to cut output.
3451 2018-01-10 18:44:44 The real story is Donad trump frauded about global warming to drill oil and it and he is a threat to all life.
3452 2018-01-10 18:44:36 Ah yes, he’s in our book (under snake oil)
3453 2018-01-10 18:44:21 More investors are favouring U.S. bonds that profit from a pickup in inflation as the global economy gathers momentum with oil and other basic commodity prices recently hitting multi-year highs.
3454 2018-01-10 18:44:17 Why are British Nationalist fanatics so ignorant? Anybody who has even a passing interest in Scottish politics would know that the Scottish Government has no control of oil revenues. It's all diverted to the British exchequer. #Referendum2018
3455 2018-01-10 18:44:15 British wine ( no disrespect Brit vineyards but really, to a Savoyard?!) washed down with snake oil...a metaphor for the state of the nation.
3456 2018-01-10 18:44:00 How much gas & oil does NYC burn up on a daily basis?
3457 2018-01-10 18:43:45 It is a fact that ALL pipelines leak. I have yet to see a case where a pipeline didn't leak within the first 3 months of operation. We could switch to solar power RIGHT NOW and end this oil/gas nonsense.
3458 2018-01-10 18:43:36 That’s what leave in conditioner/ hair oil is for.
3459 2018-01-10 18:43:36 Oh oh oh! I also do work with herbs! Tea blends and oil tinctures and such. Wow I appreciate the kindness so much  what a lovely plant based GODdess you are!!!
3460 2018-01-10 18:43:32  omg that’s funny. But know it’s not. Poor poor thing. Bet you’ve tried everything! Castor oil?
3461 2018-01-10 18:43:26 Take your oil
3462 2018-01-10 18:43:22 All we can do is trade price and do our best to risk manage trade and curb losses as much as possible. Conviction is running high on OIL GOLD SPX short but to no avail thus far.  Likely will work but until you have to survive and be liquid enough to withstand draw-downs.
3463 2018-01-10 18:43:10 "The nastiest and phoniest things in the world cannot be fondled or even ingested - they must be washed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
3464 2018-01-10 18:43:09 I think the door is really open now for exemptions. No one wants oil rigs offshore with likely accidents and spills. Bad for the Environment wherever we live in the country.
3465 2018-01-10 18:43:06 i used this facewash for a long time and i loved it!! i use it with an oil cleanser and it REALLY helps to take everything off especially in the rare times i wear makeup lol

3471 2018-01-10 18:42:40 It all goes with the territory but any coach understands what the non coaching world has a hard time getting! As if the trash collector to Oil baron and everyone b/t does their job to perfection!

3473 2018-01-10 18:42:35 @MickWest I've just watched the corbett report's "how and why big oil conquered the world", kinda skeptical about it but it would make sense if that wasn't all bullshit. Since you're a professional debunk-er, could you take a look at it and give your opinion on the matter? cheers
3474 2018-01-10 18:42:30 good place to get an oil change?
3475 2018-01-10 18:42:11 Nada. Love the Gulf Coast. Except many states there have thousands of residents who already make a living off of oil exploration and drilling. So, leaving them off my White House request. Hopeful. If @realDonaldTrump is going to listen to Christie, why wouldn't he listen to me?
3476 2018-01-10 18:41:56 Burning midnight oil is such a pain in the ass.
3477 2018-01-10 18:41:51 Jan. 10, 1870 - John D. Rockefeller incorporates Standard Oil.

3480 2018-01-10 18:41:35 Hi Richard, Brent Oil looks a pretty strong uptrend and with Global Economy firing well it's likely to continue. $70 a key Resistance level I think.
3481 2018-01-10 18:41:34 Take it from a right-wing organization financed by oil money, there’s no climate change. Also, no Russian collusion. And tax cuts pay for themselves.
3482 2018-01-10 18:41:31 Coconut oil

3486 2018-01-10 18:40:59 Sen Feinstein:  Just have your Governor ask, that seemed to work for Florida.  But then, does he have a property near the water (like Mir A Lago) that could be damaged if there were an oil spill?  I am sure that is the determining factor for granting the waiver.
3487 2018-01-10 18:40:57 With/without co2 cuts bc Oil & Gas industry caused it
3488 2018-01-10 18:40:50 Oh wow. It is hideous. Who's idea was that? I'm assuming those Q-tips are windmills. The building looks like an oil cylinder.
3489 2018-01-10 18:40:45 I was making food and I ended with hot oil in my eye
3490 2018-01-10 18:40:37 Right. I’m don’t think one would use the 2008-09 period to measure anything about success of TX vs CA state policies (tho TX politicians were happy to do so). Maybe 2011-16 a more stable time, but oil/gas downturn in there will skew to CA’s favor. Not entirely a policy issue.
3491 2018-01-10 18:40:35 Enough with these soulless greedy inhumane crooks working for special interest/big oil turning a deaf ear to the people! @GOP @HouseGOP
3492 2018-01-10 18:40:34 นี่ก็ปาเองหิวเองเหมือนกัน งือ กลิ่นต้มยำจุ้งลอยมาเลย แง

3494 2018-01-10 18:40:28 The USA already is a net oil exporter with all the recent exploration.  More offshore drilling is the last thing we need.
3495 2018-01-10 18:40:22 ベスーベスー！はははやめろってくすぐったい～
3496 2018-01-10 18:40:19 The fact they rolled back safety regulations for off shore oil rigs shows how little they care!!!!
New GOP safety rules:
Rewrite them.
Ignore them.
Pretend they don't help.
Pretend they don't matter.
@SenFeinstein is doing her job, keep supporting her please!!!
3497 2018-01-10 18:40:09 ああ、これ？スポーツブラ。油の貯蔵庫が垂れちゃうからね。
3498 2018-01-10 18:40:06 And Trump Administration responds:  “No... and in fact, we’re going to explore for oil in your blowhole...”...
3499 2018-01-10 18:40:05 You really haven't a clue about devolved powers . Oil revenues are NOT devolved . Why do you think Wastemonster won't let Scotland go ... because then Scotland will have total control of our oil .
3500 2018-01-10 18:40:05 Wow if you really want to spontaneously clear your nose and make your eyes water just accidentally get peppermint oil in your mouth it’s a treat 
3501 2018-01-10 18:40:02 I don't like relying on 18/19s to develop. Drafting isn't exact enough to say Benson, Maximov and Safin will all be sure fire NHLers. The Oil have missed a step in the development with so many players going straight to the NHL and trying to fill into the gaps with college FAs
3502 2018-01-10 18:40:00 I'm on Day 4 too... yesterday, woke up to text from my mom, concerned that the LA flu has killed 27 people under 65. But grateful her recent obsession with essential oils has landed me with a diffuser and... I think the snake oil is actually helping... that and Theraflu.
3503 2018-01-10 18:39:53 Try coconut oil!  
3504 2018-01-10 18:39:52 Can’t have oil spills closing down his beach right?
3505 2018-01-10 18:39:49 Noooooooooo the Muji is closed and I'm out of cleansing oil 
3506 2018-01-10 18:39:39 KEEP THIS UP! THEY HAVE TO KNOW AMERICANS ARE STANDING UP AND ARE WITH THEM FOR THEIR GOD GIVEN FREEDOM! ALSO SOUTH KOREA SHOULD NOT SUPPORT THEM BY BUYING THEIR LEADERS OIL! NOW WE HAVE A BIG ASS #OCEAN OIL MESS BECAUSE OF POOR SAFETY!
3507 2018-01-10 18:39:31 Here’s an idea! Those 5 major oil companies should end any and all business with NYC. See how long it takes for them to drop the suit
3508 2018-01-10 18:39:29 Very interesting http//www.thegatewaypundit.com/2018/01/somethings-fishy-iranian-oil-tanker-fire-ocean-160-miles-shanghai-headed-north-korea/
3509 2018-01-10 18:39:22 They all own oil companies now so how stupid do you feel
3510 2018-01-10 18:39:20 What kind of tanning oil do you use?
3511 2018-01-10 18:39:18 It is also due to the fact the Florida is tourist based in making money , No State tax, and a spill would devastate Florida for decades. Not saying that oil spills would not devastate others. Florida just has some of the most beautiful beaches in the World.
3512 2018-01-10 18:39:17 Reading a good book is a helpful way of unwinding. I also occasionally use an essential oil pillow spray with Lavendar to calm down and am trying to eliminate technology before bed.
3513 2018-01-10 18:39:01 The CBD oil would help so much! :(
3514 2018-01-10 18:38:55 this is the wetlands of Louisiana before oil drilling and now.  Scientist say the wetlands will never recover .. essentially dead
3515 2018-01-10 18:38:53 Much of the electorate in the SE relies on govt safety nets to stay afloat. When the electorate is homeless due to cuts in FEMA and oil slicks on their beaches or too sick to afford healthcare they will turn around. I now understand why Jefferson only wanted the learned to vote.
3516 2018-01-10 18:38:47 Castor oil can cause miscarriage.
3517 2018-01-10 18:38:43 Offshore drilling/oil production has proven to be very safe and environmentally friendly.
3518 2018-01-10 18:38:41 His family doesn't own Arm & Hammer. His grandfather was on the Board of Arm & Hammer but he was an oil magnate. His grandfather joined the Board because he thought it was funny. But it is just a coincidence.
3519 2018-01-10 18:38:40 @JimNorton hey @StanLeeComicCon lets throw some hot oil on em
3520 2018-01-10 18:38:37 BBC2 TV prog this evening based on coconut oil coincides with a video I saw - suggesting that trials have shown coconut oil can halt or reverse dementia. Anything that can do what it says is worth considering.

3523 2018-01-10 18:38:28 Coconut oil and water solve about 95% of my problems

3525 2018-01-10 18:38:10 It burns oil but for some engines it’s not always a bad thing
3526 2018-01-10 18:38:06 Of course we're the sinful nation! Must be invaded, colonized & punished well as it happened in Trianon!
Yes we're bombing the whole middle-east for power & oil, but in name of freedom & democracy whilst selling tons of bombs & arms for our Saudi friends & other despots! Hmmm !
3527 2018-01-10 18:38:03 We have the biggest fishing port in the country New Bedford/ Fairhaven who rely on the water. Keep our waters free from these oil rigs.
3528 2018-01-10 18:38:00 ONLY IN AMERICA. WHERE THEY BLOW PEOPLE UP AND STEAL THEIR OIL AND POPPY. AND ENSLAVE THE AFRICAN AMERICAN MAN

3534 2018-01-10 18:37:27 Natural progression based on Energy Flux Density was from wood to coal/coke to oil and natural gas to nuclear and as soon as possible to Fusion. Any one technology must be superceded or you totally deplete that resouce. nuclear and fusion are million times more dense than solar.
3535 2018-01-10 18:37:18 The most esteemed and dearest oil is Almond. What is called Peach-kernel
3536 2018-01-10 18:37:03 At one point its estimated about 90% of Venezuela's revenue came from export of oil & gas. The government overspent & mismanaged revenue, not using the oil money to diversify & to grow the economy.
When exports/ oil price fell lagged so die the economy.
3537 2018-01-10 18:36:58 This is a problem in Africa too! It was a problem in USA during early 1900's. Cut wood, burn an oil lamp & haul water! Buck up. We had to!
3538 2018-01-10 18:36:55 Who knew that hot oil and water don't mix. How often is this show coming out? He burns the house down within 10 eps.
3539 2018-01-10 18:36:51 Only snake oil.
3540 2018-01-10 18:36:49 I say let's drill off the coast of Florida right next to Mara Largo Resort let Trump's oil overspill onto his Golf Resort that would be awesome he can see the oil rigs in crap right off the golf course and rate out of the windows of his Resort Suites and serve oil for breakfast
3541 2018-01-10 18:36:48 Cars won't matter much if we make the planet uninhabitable. Deepwater Horizon? Oil tanker currently ablaze in China sea.....

3543 2018-01-10 18:36:46 Big Oil has KNOWN SINCE 1967, that the burning of Fossil Fuels resulted in a higher CO2 output into the atmosphere which would RESULT IN GLOBAL WARMING!
3544 2018-01-10 18:36:34 Is there nothing the Republicans won’t destroy as they slash and burn their way to riches for that top 1%? Even the destruction of our oceans to keep those Oil Company donations rolling in - just so long as the oil rigs don’t obstruct the view from Mar a Lago. #feelingpowerless
3545 2018-01-10 18:36:30 Food for thought: Assume #ClimateChange is a lie & human consumption of #FossilFuels isn't the problem. Why oppose #RenewableEnergy when we know that oil will run out some day? Where is the downside in the Investment of renewable energy?  I see no problem with energy diversity.

3556 2018-01-10 18:35:52 An increase in production of oil in Canada this year #RAEforecast
3557 2018-01-10 18:35:50 Zinke should removed from office immediately.  He is willfully ignorant, an agent of big oil, and totally unqualified for the job.
3558 2018-01-10 18:35:50 Mine do too!! The oregano oil and taking a couple Advil’s should help until you get them taken out
3559 2018-01-10 18:35:46 Well, specifically *health* insurance (no one expects their State Farm guy to pay for oil changes). Major part of the problem.
3560 2018-01-10 18:35:39 to have someone for u when ure burning the midnight oil is a blessed .
3561 2018-01-10 18:35:38 The U.S. within the next 10 years will be a net exporter of oil #yeg #raeforecast #maketherightmove
3562 2018-01-10 18:35:24 @KirstenKing_ I can't believe Trump is targeting CA. again and again. First with oil drilling off or coast, and now 7/11 owners. They are productive members of society. What's next, independent motel owners?
3563 2018-01-10 18:35:14 It looks like offshore oil rigs are exciting to him ... unless  they affect the ocean view from any of his properties.
3564 2018-01-10 18:35:14 Is it lame of me to take my Switch in public? I don't wanna be bored at the auto shop getting my oil changed
3565 2018-01-10 18:35:13 You need to understand t's need for revenge. He was crushed in CA vote. He was humiliated when he appeared at a NoCAL fundraiser by having to schlep across a field to enter hotel thru back door bc of protestors out front. So--ex-out SALT and new offshore oil rigs. Take that, CA
3566 2018-01-10 18:34:58 You want to end this abuse of the courts in less than 24 hours? If all oil and gasoline suppliers would immediately stop selling their products in New York City, the hue and cry from the cabbies alone will bring it to an end. De Blasio is a total buffoon!

- read more of that book that somehow makes corruption sound boring
- brainstorm ideas for this month's blogpost

3581 2018-01-10 18:33:59 It will get your energy to you. Of course, you have enough oil and no one else deserves any right?
3582 2018-01-10 18:33:56 Exactly what i was thinking. If there was a group of black ppl and someone said oil spill they'd get dragged. Double standard
3583 2018-01-10 18:33:54 Oil , gases, chemicals

3586 2018-01-10 18:33:50 How can that be true? They've suing oil companies for causing Global Warming! You mean that doesn't enhance their business?
3587 2018-01-10 18:33:40 Marinate the chops with salt n pepper. Heat oil in a heavy bottom pan. Keep the chops in it & turn it brown on all sides. Pour a tbs of soya sauce. Close the pan, reduce the flame & cook for 15mnts. Tadaaa.. :)
3588 2018-01-10 18:33:17 Natural home remedies for hair fall :
1. Extract the juice from an onion & mix it with olive oil, apply this on the scalp & massage really well. Keep this for 30 mins & wash off. 
2. Black seed oil (Kalonji) with olive coconut & castor oil helps promote hair growth.

3592 2018-01-10 18:32:49 I'm so cheap sometimes... I made my own cuticle pen. ain’t nobody is paying $10-15 for some oil mixture in a pen here. nope.
3593 2018-01-10 18:32:30 Hey @SecretaryZinke I'll direct your attention to the pristine beautiful Pacific Coast, that doesn't want oil drilling either.  We don't want it dumped on by you or @realdonaldtrump.  You are both hateful, mean-spirited, corrupt people.
3594 2018-01-10 18:32:30 I was in NOLA shortly after the BP disaster & the devastation was horrific!! You are so right--this is not a matter with which we want to *hope for the best* & put profits over safety for the oil industry!!

3596 2018-01-10 18:32:19 Of which the OIL Magnates will not allow. Solar, free energy from the sun? Who will need oil?
3597 2018-01-10 18:32:08 I'm thinking of industrial clusters that aren't centred on cities. So far I've got Cadarache (France), CERN, Kourou, and North Sea Oil.
3598 2018-01-10 18:32:07 They weren't?
3599 2018-01-10 18:32:06 With all the garbage dumped off new York city,  drilling and making us independent of Arab oil shouldn't be a problem
3600 2018-01-10 18:32:03 This was done in oil? It has a fresh look of a digitally rendered piece. I'm surprised I haven't come across it before. This piece is simply incredible.
3601 2018-01-10 18:31:57 Hahaha
3602 2018-01-10 18:31:52 Fossil fuels are a limited resource, not "renewable". We will run out. Fracking is evidence of the short supply.  Fracking is extremely energy intensive, meaning it takes a lot of energy to extract a relatively small amount of oil, compared to say, oil drilling in Middle East.
3603 2018-01-10 18:31:41 What is causing the oil consumption?
3604 2018-01-10 18:31:41 A day after @FLGovScott's photo op with @SecretaryZinke on removing #Florida from oil drilling consideration, @American_Bridge is submitting a FOIA request for records between Scott admin & Trump admin "on this cheap political stunt."
3605 2018-01-10 18:31:41 No, obviously. 
Laughable to espouse a middle school version of efficient markets! 
Oil prices collapsed 70% and the money never showed up ANYWHERE not until oil started to climb back again. They investors showed up EVERYWHERE.
3606 2018-01-10 18:31:22 Hey five big oil companies.

You can cut back on global warming IMMEDIATELY stop providing any of your products to NY state.  That will shore up millions of Carbon units, and give NY what they want!!  #ilovenyc   Voters stand up, your govt is running you over.
3607 2018-01-10 18:31:21 That feeling when you hop out the shower & smother yourself in coconut oil

3617 2018-01-10 18:30:47 Why? Isn’t there any coal, oil, or uranium beneath it?!
3618 2018-01-10 18:30:45 Putting Argan Oil on my face really paying off
3619 2018-01-10 18:30:23 Not just any other oil producing country. Conflict countries with 100's of years of various  abuse & atrocities against women, child brides & homosexual people. Also proven records of fighting & killing of Canadians during war.

3622 2018-01-10 18:30:14 de Blasio/NYC sues oil companies over climate change. Why not the car companies? Airlines? Beef producers? Glad I’m not a nyc taxpayer #whatajoke #onlythelawyerswin
3623 2018-01-10 18:30:02 Californians consume a lot of oil products. They should not put the risks of extracton onto other States and other countries, particularly 3rd world countries so they can live in oil-based luxury in CA. Immoral.
3624 2018-01-10 18:29:57 #Hi #ImMrMeseeks #LookAtMe How dare the US not keep oil prices artificially high at the expense of the American people!

3628 2018-01-10 18:29:23 Tell them how you took away the funds in case we have another oil disaster and the one that was created to clean up massive oil spills and then trying to let big oil companies all over the coast of the United States you don't give a damn Trump but yourself you're like a cancer

3634 2018-01-10 18:28:48 Why do you just assume it’s just oil? They own so many other businesses around the works people haven’t got a clue about our owners really. All clubs would be where they are at without investors, that’s a fact.
3635 2018-01-10 18:28:41 Evening Primrose oil capsules inserted vaginally softens the cervix.  Obviously read about it but I've known it to work. Sex and nipple stimulation can help. Good luck!
3636 2018-01-10 18:28:40 I live in South Laguna.   trust me we have a tourists.  I hereby declare CA off-limits for new oil platforms.  anyone who tries will be citizen-arrested and forced to surf urban runoff after a rainstorm.
3637 2018-01-10 18:28:34 The Oil industry kept this country afloat. Regardless if it was subsidized the return on the investment was insane for Canada. They collected huge royalties. People always bring up subsidies with the oil industry without bringing up the profits the Canadian government reaped.
3638 2018-01-10 18:28:24 My regular hot mechanic must have fucking quit without letting me know  :(  I’m never gonna get my oil changed again

3641 2018-01-10 18:28:13 Oh yes! I left out a big one. They agreed on olive oil as well. And plants too.
3642 2018-01-10 18:28:13 She is a charlatan. A con. A snake oil salesperson. The epitome of evil and the opposite of Christ. This woman is a predator.

3650 2018-01-10 18:27:41 Hemp oil apparently boost the immune system, helps healthy cells to repair faster.  It is not a cancer healer, and doesn't work on everyone.  We bought really quality organic, not from a company but home made by a medical doctor.  Made from medical plants with only buds.

3652 2018-01-10 18:27:40 Be careful next time you get an oil change cause i think once you go synthetic once it’s bad for the engine to switch back
3653 2018-01-10 18:27:20 Is there standard properties which indicate of Oil possibility exist?
3654 2018-01-10 18:27:13 I WANT A VEHICLE THAT IS GOOD ON GAS AS WELL AS EASE OF MAINTENANCE.  I do not think to change oil you would have to remove the front right tire and the suspension just to reach the OIL FILTER!
3655 2018-01-10 18:27:13 It's not just that oil companies produced a product that increased greenhouse gases. They concealed and distorted the causes of climate change and funded science denial.

3658 2018-01-10 18:26:59 This deals only with the "public practice" not the private practice. Corporations exploring for Oil & Gas fall under "private". Beside the point though because I'm retired. Worked for Pennzoil in the 1980s

3660 2018-01-10 18:26:51 home grown organic iero grease is a healthy emo's alternative to conventional cooking oils. much like coconut oil, it has many proven health benefits. available soon at your local whole foods!
3661 2018-01-10 18:26:45 both of those are very good for your skin in different ways, castor oil reduces inflammation among other things and coconut oil is both soothing but has a cleansing effect,
3662 2018-01-10 18:26:39 Very misleading article. Canola (rapeseed) oil and soybean oil are harmful. You also must define the type of coconut oil, refined vs. virgin cold pressed unrefined, the latter of which has the healthy benefits. Very disappointing to see this failure from Mashable.
3663 2018-01-10 18:26:34 French food=Butter

3664 2018-01-10 18:26:26 The future survival of our planet is WAY more important than unscrupulous Big Oil oligarchs & corporations making $! They took natural resources from Earth (which belongs to all Earthlings) at unreasonably low prices; &made trillions in profit. Now it's time for them to pay back!
3665 2018-01-10 18:26:22 Olive oil, salt, pepper the fresh green beans. Get oven to 400, spread the greenies on a sheet pan. Put em in, Shake em every 15/20 minutes until there’s a good amount of brown on them and Ta da!
3666 2018-01-10 18:26:05 Same for CA we don’t need or want drilling off our coast! lol is not safe, but you know that look at all the oil spills in MT... people and environment over oil profits for once.

Lots of Russian money flowed to the GOP.
3671 2018-01-10 18:25:49 NYC mayor announcing divestment from 190 fossil fuel reserve-owning companies, up to $5 billion in assets. But more remarkably: with lawsuit, laying full-fire blame on big oil companies for costs of city hurricane damage and protection measures.
3672 2018-01-10 18:25:47 It is a ton of oil though. This morning I had 2 scrambled eggs in 2 tbsp of butter and cheese. Fatty
3673 2018-01-10 18:25:38 Blocking the Trump plan to expand offshore oil drilling is a top priority of mine in 2018. We don’t want to be one mistake away from environmental catastrophe. The dangers are too great!
3674 2018-01-10 18:25:33 Going thrifting after this oil change.
3675 2018-01-10 18:25:19 It honestly just depends on what type of skin you have. I have oil skin so I’ve liked Too Faced Peach Perfect, Diorskin Forever Perfect Foundation, Milk Blur Liquid Makeup.

3682 2018-01-10 18:24:53 “The days of drilling for oil are numbered,” @SenFeinstein said. “We have clean-energy alternatives that can grow our economy faster without jeopardizing our coastal economies and natural resources.” Missed this great quote last week in @latimes #ProtectOurCoast

3686 2018-01-10 18:24:36 Maybe they own the oil rights off their beach.
3687 2018-01-10 18:24:29 .@NYCMayor: "It's time for big oil to take responsibility for the devastation they have wrought and that alone will take us forward in a powerful way to know that we will use the full power of the court system to get justice."

3689 2018-01-10 18:23:52 Shiff!, you don't care about protecting the already protected coastlines. You only want to suppress the Oil & Gas industry so your Communist party can control the energy industry. That way you can give contracts for pie in the sky energy that never produces to your cronies!

3691 2018-01-10 18:23:36 Make plans!! Change your oil. Vacuum the car. Dust. Shovel. Do dishes. Do laundry.  
3692 2018-01-10 18:23:31 "Sandy didn't happen by accident. For decades Big Oil ravaged the environment." 

New York City mayor just announced a lawsuit against Exxon, Shell, BP & other Big Oil companies for the damages caused by climate change. + NYC's #divestment from fossil fuels. #keepitintheground
3693 2018-01-10 18:23:30 Oil is for the weak.
3694 2018-01-10 18:23:30 "For decades big oil ravaged the environment," @BilldeBlasio says. "They used a classic cynical playbook. They denied and denied and denied that their product was lethal...It's time for them to start paying for the damage they've done."
3695 2018-01-10 18:23:30 Needs an Oil Change bad . I keep missing my appointments 
3696 2018-01-10 18:23:29 @WADeptHealth #Medicaid if you paid for #medicalmarijuana #Oil then I could really END #OpioidCrisis in WA @AGOWA  Then world. @premera pays for #Boeing pension #edibles so why not @GovInslee @PattyMurray my cost is $350/batch. Think of the possibilities if it was covered
3697 2018-01-10 18:23:23 What? Sounds like pointy headed fact based babble to me! Oil executives in Houston are entitled to their stock options!
#BlueWave2018 
3698 2018-01-10 18:23:22 .@NYCMayor : "It's time for them to start paying for the damage they have done. It's time for Big Oil to take responsibility for the devastation they have wrought."

3700 2018-01-10 18:23:07 I can tell the manager at this oil change place likes me. I’m not into him but I’m chillin so I can get a discount on this high ass oil change.
3701 2018-01-10 18:22:55 I can't believe I forgot to tell the cool med student subletting my spare room that the coconut oil in the bathroom routinely goes on my undercarriage. I hope they haven't used it yet. Because I can say for sure that... it's definitely been contaminated.
3702 2018-01-10 18:22:55 I wish it was off the table for Big Cypress "oil exploration". What's the status?

3704 2018-01-10 18:22:40 THE ENTIRE FEGGIN PLANET - EVERY CITY & NATION - NEEDS TO SUE BIG OIL & FOSSIL FUEL CORPORATIONS FOR KNOWINGLY POLLUTING OUR PLANET & RISKING CLIMATE CRISIS. THEY MADE TRILLIONS $ IN PROFIT. THEY NEED TO FUND GLOBAL SWITCH OVER TO CLEAN RENEWABLE ENERGY. THEY CAN AFFORD TO DO IT.
3705 2018-01-10 18:22:36 If it wasn’t for the oil companies most New Yorkers would have frozen to death last week. Let’s be grateful for oil/gas and #celebrateCO2. Earth is getting Brenner I’m higher level CO2. Crop yields are up. CO2=life.
3706 2018-01-10 18:22:35 Oil should sue NY for buying and using products they believe are causing “global warming” (as they’re mired in artic cold). And oil should stop selling anything to blue states immediately (and watch the law suits). Leftist revolutionaries should be hung.
3707 2018-01-10 18:22:34 .@NYCMayor said the city is suing 5 oil majors for millions (billions?) to help the city response to and prepare for climate impacts
3708 2018-01-10 18:22:33 U.S. oil price rises to highest level since 2014
3709 2018-01-10 18:22:28 Use the provided cleaning cloth to remove oil and residue that may accumulate on the frame and lens. A small amount of mild dish soap or a specially-formulated eyeglass cleaner may also be used. After washing, rinse the glasses and then dry with a soft cleaning cloth.
3710 2018-01-10 18:22:24 We suggested hemp oil, aka Tony Simpson.  She started two week before Christmas, went for a update with oncologist on bone spots 27 Dec, scan showed liver cancer reduced 65%, liver function 50% improved.  I know this is weird, but worth mentioning.  We were blown away.
3711 2018-01-10 18:22:23 Yet you press ‘post’ on a phone made of oil in an internet made of oil. I’m sure you’re warm from ff on these frigid days. Git.
3712 2018-01-10 18:22:12 Yes we do but most products that have water as the main ingredients are widely marketed & senang nak dapat. That's why I use face oil a lot, it's magic to my skin! 
3713 2018-01-10 18:22:11 The city filed a lawsuit last night in federal court against 5 oil companies,  BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil, and Royal Dutch Shell.

3719 2018-01-10 18:21:53 Yep, but I would submit that the oil/yuan contract is the gun on the wall. We've known it was hanging there for several months (chapters) now. This latest "news" simply reminds the audience of the fundamental problem for which the gun will become the solution.
3720 2018-01-10 18:21:51 Exporting a lot more oil as well.
3721 2018-01-10 18:21:46 Good point - Yes it is a political stunt. Mar-a-lago is in FL and our dear leader I am sure doesn't want to see oil derricks every morning, and FL is red (unfortunately).
3722 2018-01-10 18:21:40 Good decision! We have enough problems, from hurricane damage. We do not need an oil spill.
3723 2018-01-10 18:21:35 Y’all should get on oil pulling too. Gurgle a tablespoon of organic, refined coconut oil for 10 minutes while you getting ready in the morning. Shit takes all the toxins out of your mouth, makes your teeth whiter, clears your skin up, etc. If you don’t believe google oil pulling
3724 2018-01-10 18:21:33 Mayor de Blasio on city's lawsuit against 5 major oil companies: "They are the central actors. They are the first ones responsible for this [environmental] crisis and they should not get away with it anymore."

3731 2018-01-10 18:20:58 Trump has also eliminated safety rules for offshore drilling rigs, inviting another Deepwater Horizon, and is removing the tax that funds oil spill clean-ups.  Triple whammy.
3732 2018-01-10 18:20:58 Is he using the same law firm to sue the oil co’s that also handled his campaign lawsuits?
3733 2018-01-10 18:20:53 Are they trying to reduce crime in Chicago with a huge aromatherapy oil diffuser full of lavender & eucalyptus?

3738 2018-01-10 18:20:28 Ok.
Remove ALL petroleum products from the proper of NYC.
Gasoline
Diesel
Oil
Propane
Any other fuels.
Announce that it would NOT be in the best interest of the oil companies to continue to provide supplies to the city and city vehicles while litigation is in process.
3739 2018-01-10 18:20:26 lmao almost forgot about getting my oil changed today
3740 2018-01-10 18:20:21 STATEMENT BY MAJOR OIL COMPANIES:

“In order to protect the environment and combat Global Warming (or Cooling) we are suspending all shipments of petroleum products to New York City. By this act we stand with the environmentally conscious people of New York City.”
3741 2018-01-10 18:20:20 I think you guys are missing my point:

Scotland already has the power to ask for a change at Westminster and has the influence to negotiate with the Conservative party a better deal for Scotland in Brexit.

E.G Oil revenue to be devolved for exchange of some brexit support.
3742 2018-01-10 18:20:19 I know you know!! Lol sometimes i came to school wit that stiff style cuz Mom sprayed too much oil in it l

3744 2018-01-10 18:20:10 Nah the only reason why they say not to touch it is cus of the oil on your hands causes it to burst from all the heat but it could just be a faulty wire.
3745 2018-01-10 18:20:09 Oil cans and gas spouts...makes my heart flutter
3746 2018-01-10 18:20:06 60 dollar oil change

3753 2018-01-10 18:19:24 So you like the new regulations on allowing gas and oil drilling off the NC coast?
3754 2018-01-10 18:19:21 I personally have about 15ml mct + 10-15g Coco oil every morning in tea, a mix of green tea (sencha + kukicha).
3755 2018-01-10 18:19:20 debating on buying a pair of headphones just so i can watch the sopranos while penny gets an oil change
3756 2018-01-10 18:19:20 This can only happen in a communist community or in an environment where thugs rule and think the shakedown is still viable. I truly hope these five oil companies financially destroyed New York City
3757 2018-01-10 18:19:17 Israel is not libareting Kurds, prepearing Turkey for New World order Euroasia structure while stealing their oil
3758 2018-01-10 18:19:16 Will not happen, we need the Saudi oil...........oil before lives are the US/UK motto.

3763 2018-01-10 18:18:59 Or use   coconut  oil  its also  really  works  
3764 2018-01-10 18:18:58 Oh FFS are you for real ? Should not be on here if you don’t know your Country or what the score is. Its being shafted by WM,away & do some research.

3773 2018-01-10 18:18:07 Damn Willie ass was at the fitting room lastnight and I didn’t think about asking him about the motor oil

3775 2018-01-10 18:17:51 New York joined other municipalities hoping to use the law to hold oil and gas producers responsible for costs related to the environmental effects of their products.
3776 2018-01-10 18:17:49 .@JerryBrownGov on Trump admin exempting FLA but not CA from new oil drilling plan: "They’ve set the precedent in Florida and we’re hoping for the same exemption." Going way out of his way to avoid declarations of war.
3777 2018-01-10 18:17:49 It sounds like you’ve reached the stage of eating spicy salads, going to the trampoline park, researching castor oil...
3778 2018-01-10 18:17:45 Need to re-up on my hair supplies and face care items. I know I need more gel, oil, leave in and rose water /witch hazel
3779 2018-01-10 18:17:44 @nycgov Typical liberal SNOW FLAKES,blaming the oil companies for global warming,ask the east coast if theres any global warming going on. Global warming DOES NOT EXIST,IT'S A LIE!!! you people are PATHETIC!!!
3780 2018-01-10 18:17:36 Well done to the donors of the heating oil This was a despicable crime, hope the thieves have a rotten year and life 
3781 2018-01-10 18:17:32 My hair used to be sooooo dead in high school, argan oil saved me. I also used to use coconut oil every few days for a deep conditioning. And I completely stopped with all heat, I don’t do my hair anymore I let the natural curls take over 
3782 2018-01-10 18:17:30 But it wasn't the rig upsetting the tourism, it was that horrible, partisan, liberal oil
3783 2018-01-10 18:17:28 No worries, stop delivering oil to NYC.  Problem solved!
3784 2018-01-10 18:17:26 Momma makes a mix of white vinegar, distilled water and lemon essential oil to clean all hard surfaces. Works great

3786 2018-01-10 18:17:22 I used baby oil.  He really just did that because he had nothing better to do. Next time ima send him to school like that and embarrass him
3787 2018-01-10 18:17:22 @lisamurkowski is THIS an example of "responsible energy development" for the #arcticrefuge ? Oil wells requiring fresh water, a cocktail of chemicals, etc. all for a FINITE resource? #KeepItInTheGround #ProtectOurCoast #protectthearctic
3788 2018-01-10 18:17:18 IT'S BEEN 8 YEARS SINCE THE OIL SPILL, DAWN STOP USING THAT TO GET US TO BUY YOUR DISH SOAP
3789 2018-01-10 18:17:02 Current mood: being shamed by the mechanic for being way way way way way overdue for an oil change.
3790 2018-01-10 18:17:01 It is so dry right now!! I’ve been mixing our serum with our day cream and just letting it set on my face for a few minute and it soaks in almost right away! Love the jojoba oil ide Carrie! Will have to try ~ Nicola
3791 2018-01-10 18:16:57 Sounds plausible all of the above. But if so, @StatoilASA could or should remove 500kg of CO2 via DAC/CCS pr. barrel of oil produced and sell «CO2 neutral oil», or if 1ton CCS pr barrel sell CO2 negative fossil fuel...
3792 2018-01-10 18:16:51 Was yesterday April Fool's Day? BBC docu #CanveyThePromisedIsland was unbelievable. Hasidic extremely trad Jews bought 30 homes on Canvey Island. It seems they love the oil covered beaches & below sea-level aspect.
3793 2018-01-10 18:16:47 And the march toward communism continues. Pretty soon the state will determine oil execs “mentally ill” for killing the planet and seize control to “protect” everyone
3794 2018-01-10 18:16:40 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
3795 2018-01-10 18:16:39 “We are going after those who have profited,” @NYCMayor says of his plans to sue big oil for Hurricane Sandy reparations
3796 2018-01-10 18:16:27 I need to get an oil change, a car wash and need to pack my duffle.

3799 2018-01-10 18:16:12 Have you tried a few drops of Lavender Oil on your pillow (or on a tissue tucked inside pillowcase) I find an eye mask helps if I wake in the night.
3800 2018-01-10 18:16:12 oooh which essential oil/scent tho?
3801 2018-01-10 18:16:08 And, when will the city and their citizens stop using oil?  Isn't this just as much a user issue?  Talk about misguided, frivolous and a poor use of taxpayer resources.
3802 2018-01-10 18:16:07 If your animation was a car it would've had 5 oil changes already...7 under the old "every 3k" standard.

Don't look too deeply into that metaphor, it falls apart pretty quick. But still! Well done, ma'am! Thanks for all your hard work that we absolutely don't deserve! 
3803 2018-01-10 18:16:03 Plenty there makes me think it’s a sham. Maduro is involved. Bolivar was oil backed. Failed. Ven has huge debts to China/Russia. Payment is in oil. How’s that going to work? How will trusy be established (needed for working currency)? Trust in #Maduro? #petrocoin
3804 2018-01-10 18:16:02 @TWGinfo your company is making me jump through hoops for a repair that would be covered if I can find 2 oil change receipts. This is crazy. The dealership clearly stated this isn't due to negligence.
3805 2018-01-10 18:16:02 ...and tomorrow, you will probably give approval for oil drilling, fracking, and mining in that park.
3806 2018-01-10 18:16:01 Hey 5 Major oil companies, CUT OFF OIL TO NYC
3807 2018-01-10 18:16:00 New Yorkers? Keep a real close eye on your brilliant politicians! There suing 5 oil companies over climate change!
Going to be some big time $$ spent on THIS WASTE OF MONEY!
IN WHO’S POCKET?
3808 2018-01-10 18:15:51 Their never was a true spring it was a false thaw in dark, gloomy winter..a winter of despair.. prejudices..sectarianism..dollars & oil...of power sheikhs & religious sheikhs...of dictators that be & dictators that want to be....of Egypt, Libya, Bahrain, Syria ....eastern Arabia
3809 2018-01-10 18:15:45 Marmite and PG are made by Unilever and whilst both are made in the UK, all the ingredients and packaging comes from outside the UK. They're also happy to illegally destroy rainforest to farm palm oil, just fyi.
3810 2018-01-10 18:15:40 Is this the oil that goes into the old fashioned heaters?
3811 2018-01-10 18:15:35 that's bad... so does that mean there is a oil leak into the engine that then burn it/it escapes?
3812 2018-01-10 18:15:33 They'll need oil prices back up near $100/barrel again
3813 2018-01-10 18:15:32 Use  some. Oilive  oil or  coconut Oil   droplets  in  your  shampoo
3814 2018-01-10 18:15:21 I love the smell of tea tree oil 
3815 2018-01-10 18:15:19 I myself have been without work now for months because of the state of the oil industry. Where is all the concern about the thousands of people who those pipelines or refineries employ.
3816 2018-01-10 18:15:15 My question to you when you roast cauliflower how much olive oil do you use?
3817 2018-01-10 18:15:13 #oott AP saying iran sanction relief to be extended .. bearish oil
3818 2018-01-10 18:15:10 Wow, maybe it’s time to cut New York State off of all oil ?
3819 2018-01-10 18:15:09 Ok then the oil companies should stop sending natural gas to NYC let them find their own source to heat themselves that doesn't "contribute to global warning"
3820 2018-01-10 18:15:04 Why don’t we need the oil

3823 2018-01-10 18:14:41 Rub with olive oil and season with salt, pepper and thyme. Stick holes in a lemon with a fork and stick into cavity. Roast for an hour on 170°C.

3825 2018-01-10 18:14:22 Sorry about the oil drilling by the way. What’s your favorite beach? Mine’s Ocean City (Well Rehoboth is, but other than my actual beach)
3826 2018-01-10 18:14:17 gonna try out that royal purple oil for Hondad
3827 2018-01-10 18:14:13 Awesome vid, keep ‘em comin’! Another day that BI’ers no longer need to rely on one million gals of oil per year to generate electricity.
3828 2018-01-10 18:14:06 Stop drilling, you’ve hit oil.
3829 2018-01-10 18:14:03 Money is a big reason for the slowdown toward adopting clean energy, true, but not entirely due to big oil stakes.
3830 2018-01-10 18:14:03 okay i put a tiny bit of salt in bUT OIL
3831 2018-01-10 18:13:39 sautéed onions, crimini mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, baby spinach, eggs, feta, olive oil, and a scosh of frank's
3832 2018-01-10 18:13:37 It doesn’t make economic sense. Renewables sounds nice. But what do you mean ? Surely something  that’s yet to be invented. Windmills kill birds. Solar uses rare minerals that are harmful to mine. bP spill is all clean thanks to the ocean and the fact that oil is natural.
3833 2018-01-10 18:13:29 LOL! Someone emailed him pics to post. He's really flying on his oil buddies Lear jet collecting his pay cut for allowing dirty offshore drilling everywhere. Check Delta passenger manifest.
3834 2018-01-10 18:13:24 Funny how Florida just happens to be home to Trump’s Mara-lago club, a seaside vista resort...Don’t we all think Trump should have some oil rigs stationed out front for a view of his great accomplishments???
3835 2018-01-10 18:13:24 I’m gonna need this essential oil headache remedy to come through
3836 2018-01-10 18:13:23 O/N Wrap:
Most equity market take a breather - FTSE the notable exception with a new record high; oil continues to climb; yields on US 10y bonds jump again; #NZD breaks above 0.7200, but is unable to sustain the move.
3837 2018-01-10 18:13:23 I use 100 percent organic soap too! it helps you'll see a difference in like 3 days. but yea organic soap rose water and coconut oil. I use my witch hazel sometimes!
3838 2018-01-10 18:13:13 Girl castor oil
3839 2018-01-10 18:13:09 Why a picture of a spill? It's way more likely to get a spill from the non stop string of tankers bring foreign oil here than from drilling.

3842 2018-01-10 18:12:52 Lol. No problem man. Not very common to hear the pump going out. It’s a rotary oil pump and they’re reliable.

3845 2018-01-10 18:12:28 If you listen to twitter he wanted Texas oil wells
3846 2018-01-10 18:12:10 Whoa, things I didn’t know existed. Only recently learned about spray olive oil so this doesn’t throw my world off kilter. Also I totally have extra Cocoa Puffs.
3847 2018-01-10 18:12:10 So you are suing the five major oil companies for their role in climate change. I hope this (losing) lawsuit is funded by an outside group and not NYC taxpayers.
3848 2018-01-10 18:12:01 It is different than the koch brothers putting out blatantly false info out about climate change to sell oil. They are lying for profit, that is a big difference.   tit for tat, that's wrong. And yes the democrats get money from big pharma, I have a problem with that.
3849 2018-01-10 18:11:56 If he would’ve filed it in California, Washington (state) or Hawaii, a judge would have enjoined the major oil companies forcing them to stop the climate from changing
3850 2018-01-10 18:11:52 I just bought a cool new CD/cassette tape player!  No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
3851 2018-01-10 18:11:48 The best way to resist pipelines is to actually stop using oil and gas. If all Greenpeacers stop using them for good the need for pipelines would be reduced.
Please, lead by example. Thanks.
3852 2018-01-10 18:11:46 who got the oil 
3853 2018-01-10 18:11:34 New York City suing big oil companies over global warming
3854 2018-01-10 18:11:27 Ha. True story . Everything will be. I remember when I landed in uk in 91 olive oil didn’t exist. Only in Harrods . I used to travel by car with it. The 90’s are back.
3855 2018-01-10 18:11:17 OIL DIFF: 5.84 -> 5.88
3856 2018-01-10 18:11:17 If it is cheaper to extract oil from the ground then to convert CO2 to fuel, then another pathway is to use oil as we do today & offset the emissions with DAC. You could also do coal to liquids with CCS, as we have plenty of coal. That is probably cheaper than DAC to fuel?
3857 2018-01-10 18:11:16 Workflow for now...meeting after work... oil change then I .be in Decatur who .can I .pull-up. On
3858 2018-01-10 18:11:15 That's not even remotely true.  Oil only seems cheap because of externalized costs passed down to our children.  Our country's future will be so much stronger if we invest in renewables now.
3859 2018-01-10 18:11:13 someone needs to open up a placebo based hospital for us hypochondriacs. i think that's the MAIN reason people end up turning to religion and snake oil salesmen.... and GWYNETH PALTROW.

3862 2018-01-10 18:10:54 .@BilldeBlasio is announcing a plan to diverst from fossil fuels, and a lawsuit against 5 big oil companies for their contribution to climate change.
3863 2018-01-10 18:10:51 LMAO! NYC is sueing oil companies over climate change?
Just when you thought you HEARD IT ALL? Something like this comes along!
Now! Thats a GREAT example of tax payers money being wasted.
New Yorkers should hit the streets over this i would think
3864 2018-01-10 18:10:50 Thanks, @Twitter, for quickly removing yet another spoof account selling snake oil using @NBCNews logos. But it's like whack-a-mole. Some people are evil.

3868 2018-01-10 18:10:40 Saying Scotland has a fiscal deficit because the price of oil is low is like denying climate change because today is cold and you had to put on a coat.

3874 2018-01-10 18:09:54 I absolutely love @DrBronner hemp oil soaps!  Peppermint and lavender are my favourites but almond is quickly rising to the lead.  I also bought some of the bar soap to try.  #trusted #safeproduct #AllOne
3875 2018-01-10 18:09:49 1) if somebody hadn't figured out how, it wouldn't have happened. 2) there are lots of easier ways Bezos could have made his billions, eg stocks and oil. 3) our species' population is expoding anyway, density isn't amazon's fault. 4) the problem isn't density, but managing that.

3882 2018-01-10 18:09:04 Oil took a beat down. Don’t blame the rules
3883 2018-01-10 18:09:02 @wendyknowler Yr :Buttery/Butro Article from a few years back
Clover stated Butro Veg Oil content was less than 30 Veg Oil, not so? So I was i in the past informed and again most recently.
Alas as of today 10/01/2018.Clover now stating less than 35 % ! Interesting?

3884 2018-01-10 18:08:47 Washington,Oregon and Alaska  also have beautiful coastlines and huge salmon runs but Trump doesn't have a West coast white house in any of these states. STOP COASTAL OIL DRILLING ZINKE or you are looking at law suits from every coastal state
3885 2018-01-10 18:08:26 Did you know that while most residential heating oil tanks have a life expectancy of 20 years, many homes have tanks in the ground from the 1950s. Don't wait for your oil tank to corrode and leak! Let us take care of it! #HeatingOilTankDecommission #WednesdayWisdom

3892 2018-01-10 18:07:42 True a gap there, but could argue oil/gas booms provide TX a benefit CA doesn’t get. (Not arguing merits, but there is a premium to be had in good times.) Also, can pick periods in CA, especially during real estate crash, where one could find issue w/ CA economic mix.
3893 2018-01-10 18:07:40 It’s not about tax-it’s about GDP. Scotland has lost £1.8Tn NPV in oil rev alone, has vast wealth more than almost any country yet survives on pocket money, awash with food banks, infrastructure decimated to enrich bankrupt England £2 - 6Tn in debt-that’s what its about

3895 2018-01-10 18:07:20 The secret is using an oil while seasoning.
3896 2018-01-10 18:07:19 @walmarthelp Cumming Ga location. Not a single car in your service bay or outside and was quoted 2-3 hours for an oil change. Went to another provider and spent $800 on a tv at the nearby Target while I waited. You may want to rethink your staffing
3897 2018-01-10 18:07:01 Hundreds of sea turtles deposits their eggs on these shores every summer: we can't let this beach to be contaminated with oil!

3911 2018-01-10 18:05:19 This is idiotic of @RyanZinke People in every coastal state should be up in arms over this. An oil spill won't observe state boundaries and would devastate entire coastal communities, not just one state's coastline. #NoDrilling

3926 2018-01-10 18:04:05 My only queation is this. Do you really need off-shore drilling, when you had all those oil wells open up in N Dakota, that will supply us for essentially the next century? Why cap them to the build rigs at sea.

3944 2018-01-10 18:01:42 She said it as a negative comment because of Zendaya's faux locs. It was incredibly disrespectful. What girl, at seventeen, deserves to be told she look like she reeks of "patchouli oil...or weed"??
3945 2018-01-10 18:01:33 soap is made with oil and oil yess yes adultery
3946 2018-01-10 18:01:32 Do you seriously think that Scotland gets the whole price of a barrel of oil? Don’t you know that Sco gets only the TAXon oil - very little.
3947 2018-01-10 18:01:30 Ummm. CA is already littered with oil rigs you can see from the coast. Who cares if y’all have more.
3948 2018-01-10 18:01:20 250k working half the year, sounds like an oil platform job.

3951 2018-01-10 18:01:07 Probably? But it's a huge difference. If we'd kept pace w/ CA economic growth rate from 2011 - 2016, we would have had a $387 billion larger economy in 2016. Did our economy really miss out on $387B from oil prices? (Also to note, that explanation not a great story for TX either)

3957 2018-01-10 18:00:34 I remember Mr. Moolick, who grew up in Anaheim, talking about all of the oil derricks in LA. I had no idea that there were so many and right up to the beach.
3958 2018-01-10 18:00:24 Now that you voted to give the top 1% tax breaks, kick 13 million off healthcare, open unique and irreplaceable wilderness to destruction to make the oil companies happy, what are your plans after you're booted out of office? Lobbyist? Relax with a taxpayer funded retirement?

3961 2018-01-10 18:00:01 LAW CUP

@RochdaleHornets face @Roughyeds at Crown Oil Arena tonight from 7:45pm 

This was re-scheduled because of wet weather last weekend.
3962 2018-01-10 18:00:00 #FonsTips If you have dry skin, a few drops of Olive Oil will help moisturize it. It's time to take care of your body!
3963 2018-01-10 17:59:57 Also you have to wash the oil out after for the same reason
3964 2018-01-10 17:59:56 it would be a laugh to see Westminster trying to explain why at the very least the union between Scotland & England should remain without saying "because without Scots oil England's bankrupt"
3965 2018-01-10 17:59:49 They don't have any reverence for sacred lands in New Mexico either. I'm working on a doc project now about oil and gas in Greater Chaco. The lack of respect for the environment and the people who live there is mind-blowing. Zinke is as much to blame as Trump.
3966 2018-01-10 17:59:44 Truly feel for those who have lost friends or family due to these oil wars and also those with good hearts indoctrinated into fighting for a deceptive cause. Nutcases are increasing yet we're fighting them, it should be decreasing, this is just proof of the deception i'm afraid.
3967 2018-01-10 17:59:40 My oil painting class is definitely something new! I’ve never painted with oils so this is going to be a fun experience.

3973 2018-01-10 17:59:03 And i couldn't say if that's better or worse.   Though part of American history is the exploitation of the common worker,  the company store.   So i think those are the "great days" the wealthy like the trumps are shooting for.    big oil,  of course, is in the mix
3974 2018-01-10 17:59:01 NIMBY -  Cronyism for Trump's property.   Trump knows he can't afford to lose Florida voters and he doesn't want oil rigs near his resort.  So he's using his position in office to exempt himself.
3975 2018-01-10 17:59:00 Why don't they descend on Maralago and all Trump properties? Trump is all about hiring undocumented workers. PS: Why don't they off-shore oil drill right in fron of the phoney "Winter White House"??

3979 2018-01-10 17:58:29 Yes,Tamanu Oil is perfect for gently healing acne and dark spots.
3980 2018-01-10 17:58:29 I think HUR share price is much more likely a function of institutional investors taking a position pre first oil, given resource scale involved & fully funded status it’s still almost a pure option on a) oil price & b) geology panning out as predicted..which imho makes it 
3981 2018-01-10 17:58:28 Specifically Black Seed Oil. There's different types and I've gotten jipped before.

3987 2018-01-10 17:57:18 I hear you. And yeah, much was oil and gas and ripple effect of that. Saw the same trend in jobs. TX job growth below national average in 2015 and 2016 before rebounding last year (as energy/manufacturing recovered).

3997 2018-01-10 17:56:05 The argument for higher is you can’t believe any of the information fed to the public.  It’s all a grand collusion.  US production, Shale Oil, OPEC shenanigans.  Overbought is subjective based on what?  Lagging tech. indicators.  The ones buying it up don’t think it’s overbought.
3998 2018-01-10 17:56:02 Have spent the day using satin from @Colourtrend1953 brilliant product lovely look to it  and doesn't yellow like oil based paints does. Recommend 100%

4000 2018-01-10 17:55:40 yeah, different, in that Trump doesn’t want an oil platform sullying his view from mara lago.

4002 2018-01-10 17:55:33 I think all coastal states  want to keep their beautiful beaches free from oil spills ! I would much rather see wind farms off of my Long Island beaches!
4003 2018-01-10 17:55:27 Ignorance at Best corruption at the worst..either way they just have no idea what they are doing or the kickbacks from oil and gas are just too good
4004 2018-01-10 17:55:23 Thank GOD Hawaii doesn't have oil on the islands nor near its shores
4005 2018-01-10 17:55:13 I always say if I was a nigga I’d find me one girl & save! None of these hoes would say they chowing my money with their oil bfs 
4006 2018-01-10 17:55:03 mostly just chest congestion not moving enough. I bought an OTC like mucinex but haven't braved it yet. so far just teas, humidifier w/ eucalyptus oil, chest vapo-rub & heating pad, homeopathic and herbal syrups, lemon oil on my feet and sleep.
4007 2018-01-10 17:54:57 it depends what oil they were cooked in but often they are!

4009 2018-01-10 17:54:50 2/ It’s beyond me how this can happen in this day and age. It’s no wonder people search for alternatives and find nutribollocks/snake oil sellers/IgA & hair testing/juicing/Goop etc. Stress related IBS is exacerbated thanks to treatment like this, not pt’s neuroticism 
4010 2018-01-10 17:54:38 Isn't that largely Houston, driven by oil prices?
4011 2018-01-10 17:54:34 Yes just a tad;(( thanks Pollly.. you have a fab evening too

4013 2018-01-10 17:54:22 And yes, it's because the whole engine has to be lifted and yadda yadda to get the oil pan off just to get to said pieces. Still no. I'll figure this out myself.
4014 2018-01-10 17:54:09 I just cook it in vegetable oil and it comes out perfect

4016 2018-01-10 17:54:03 Belize bans oil exploration knowing what side it's bread is buttered on: if there's an oil spill, Belize tourism industry goes down the toilet. It's the same reason so many British Columbians oppose the tripling of #KinderMorgan pipeline. #StopKM #yvr #Burnaby #bcpoli #cdnpoli
4017 2018-01-10 17:54:02 Yeah but when they spill oil, they may "impact tourism."
4018 2018-01-10 17:54:00 That seems reasonable. Any discussion of olive oil or fatty acids? Will watch when I get some time...
4019 2018-01-10 17:53:53 If this is still an issue in 18 months.Kenney is coming. The clock is just counting down to an Alberta election.I bet my kids shoes he will turn off the Oil and natural gas to the lower mainland and impose duties/tariffs on goods travelling thru Alberta.
4020 2018-01-10 17:53:50 They should cut off all oil/gas from NYC for a week

Don't get me wrong, we'd love Dahlin, but we'd love Playoff Hockey way more. Just wondering if you'd grant us these 2 wishes?

1) Allow the Oilers to win 17 in a row. 
2) Offside & GI calls go our way for a change

4033 2018-01-10 17:52:23 Your facts aren't correct. How can Trump's reversal of Obama's policies still be Obama's? The new tax plan wasn't Obama's, the ACA mandate change was Obama's. I guess Obama raised oil prices with your logic. I'm not drinking the koolaid.
4034 2018-01-10 17:52:22 About to go get my oil changed so I’m getting prepared to be there for 2+ hours

The oil benchmark is, by far, the bigger story, with a much greater potential impact on the future of the USD.

4070 2018-01-10 17:48:34 Politics is more complicated than one old picture out of contexr, defining a party's entire political position. The NDP prior to election had a nuanced position where they supported value added oil projects but opposed raw export of bitumen. Today they support nearly everything.

4092 2018-01-10 17:45:42 Does anyone know where I could get some CBD oil here?
4093 2018-01-10 17:45:41 That's an interesting view & a concept I hear more and more.  It would be more credible if Baghdad were explicitly offering a re-start of Article 140 obligations, petroleum costs (not profit oil) to KRG oil producers, and demilitarization / joint sec mechanisms for Kirkuk & DIBs.
4094 2018-01-10 17:45:38 Make magnesium oil to spray on - google it to find out how to make it it’s quite simple.
4095 2018-01-10 17:45:34 So here is everything that went through my head in this episode
1. Arjun challenging Sam & his initial anger is very justified. But then Sam cleaned bowled him & that hit his ego, oil in fire & Boom. Then seeing that card, Double BOOM
Sam just has shit luck#YehUnDinonKiBaatHai
4096 2018-01-10 17:45:26 【add oil】

[慣用句](香港やその他中華英語圏)
1.頑張れ

同じ意味を持つ中国語の慣用句「加油(jia you)」からの借用語。直訳ですね。「油を加える」→「頑張れ」。

例 Add oil lor. I'll support you. 頑張れ。応援するよ。

4099 2018-01-10 17:44:59 Depends on the driving you do and type of car you have. If it’s a performance car I wouldn’t worry about months but miles 3-4000 miles is a great bet. You can send an oil sample in for analysis and they can tell you a recommended mileage based on oil condition.
4100 2018-01-10 17:44:58 And the other 84 billion in approved projects in oil gas and pipelines? guess those don't count, eh? Cause they don't fit your political agenda.... 

See why this is cognitive dissonance? 
Get help. For your own health, get help.
4101 2018-01-10 17:44:55 Since my comment was misunderstood I will clarify. I did not say to withhold cleanup funds!! That has already been done by the new tax bill. Republicans stopped the tax on oil that provides funds for a cleanup!!
4102 2018-01-10 17:44:52 あと私の場合は「グッズは公式であろうと同人であろうと買わない」という別口の制約と誓約もあるんですけど、これの効果は「これは買わない、これは買う」の判断がめちゃめちゃ早くなることですね……
4103 2018-01-10 17:44:51 Dr. Kwame Kyei oil money finished
Can't buy better players. Wei y3 d3 kc Africa? 
4104 2018-01-10 17:44:43 Peppermint oil or eucalyptus?
4105 2018-01-10 17:44:42 Dint forget the oil spill clean up fund is no longer funded
4106 2018-01-10 17:44:31 Free oil changes lol
4107 2018-01-10 17:44:31 coconut oil has drastically improved my ongoing existence, I’m a human pina colada.
4108 2018-01-10 17:44:27 Because the landlord forgot to order oil for the house
4109 2018-01-10 17:44:26 Yeah not really conditioner oil & water it’s all it takes. With leave out then yes cause you have to match up the curls
4110 2018-01-10 17:44:25 Because the US hasn’t gotten behind good research and development of clean energy sources. So we cost the birds, fish, soil and water in oil and fill the air with particulates for our children to breathe. Hmm...yes i see your point about how bad clean energy is.
4111 2018-01-10 17:44:20 Any comments on other parts of industry, eg construction, oil and gas etc? How are these industries faring?  
4112 2018-01-10 17:44:18 Thats why you have it with olive oil lol trust me I aint like it either til I had it that way
4113 2018-01-10 17:44:13 Those Venetian ‘s needed to pay carbon tax, shut down oil , gas, coal...pipelines OMG had they only known what we know.
4114 2018-01-10 17:43:54 Has anyone taken notice? Obvious on the Huge Tax Cut for the UltraRich. And now this Florida Oil Drilling exemption.

The United State Federal Government is Now Serving Red States Only.

Let's not make the same mistakes made in the years leading up to The Civil War.

#Vote2018.
4115 2018-01-10 17:43:52 Random anxiety sucks. Ever stood on the edge of a tall building? You know that feeling you get in the pit of your stomach that's like "i'm going to fall I'm going to fall I'm going to fall"?

I just got that exact feeling because I remembered I need to get an oil change.
4116 2018-01-10 17:43:49 I'm convinced DC Metro uses motor oil to mop their floors.
4117 2018-01-10 17:43:45 眠いような眠くないような感じで寝れねえ
4118 2018-01-10 17:43:41 Losing 4 liters of oil suddenly is not minor. Unless it's something silly like the drain plug fell out.
4119 2018-01-10 17:43:16 Honestly, olives can go fuck themselves. Nasty ass little oil bombs that explode in your mouth. #FOH

4121 2018-01-10 17:43:09 @jimrome I fully expect Gruden to come out with his own wine, breakfast cereal and motor oil to supplement his meager salary.
4122 2018-01-10 17:43:04 I really don't understand when people say they don't like water. Like.... you gotta be pissing kryponite & motor oil.
4123 2018-01-10 17:42:55 @hothaata wits should and must perform miracles today.. I dont know if they will use oil,petrol or holy water but they must win this game.
4124 2018-01-10 17:42:46 IOTA is like lithium. You know it’s the future of energy but gas and oil aren’t done yet. Too early to buy IOTA!
4125 2018-01-10 17:42:39 Clashes? Don’t be liars, ELN rebels have attacked with terror oil pipelines and innocents as always
4126 2018-01-10 17:42:32 Let PP invistigate  the Rupert or Ackermans or whoever she wish to. This is only for the ZUPTAS ONLY. Guys let's not mix water and oil. I REPEAT ZUPTAS FINISH & KLAAR
4127 2018-01-10 17:42:19 But I do ask my mechanic to change the wipers whenever I need the regular oil change in the fall.
4128 2018-01-10 17:42:05 @stockgurupiyush excellent interview with Mr. Mathur of Vedanta oil n gas CEO. Would be gr8 if u share the link to Vedanta share holders one more reason to hold this stock.
4129 2018-01-10 17:41:55 Right? Those oil rigs are huge. I've been on quite a few for launchings. Truth here, though, is that the rigs would make the anchoring of Putin's couriers' ships harder.
4130 2018-01-10 17:41:52 I just bought a essential oil humidifier/diffuser and oils and im obsessed i swear it cured my 5 week cold!
4131 2018-01-10 17:41:47 Am wondering after snow bomb in north east america no body talked about environmental rape & global warming. only environmental and global warming global pollution issues thrown at developing world especially #India #China how about Antarctica oil drilling & #Shale oil/ gas #USA.
4132 2018-01-10 17:41:42 Need to clean mine up, oil the chain, pump up the tyres.

4136 2018-01-10 17:41:23 OIL DIFF: 5.86 -> 5.9
4137 2018-01-10 17:41:13 Dude....Incase you haven’t noticed oil, gas and coal are a thing of the past. They pollute our great environment. The future is green renewable energy. Time you and the moron @realDonaldTrump figured this out. Stop flying on tax payer funded private jets.
4138 2018-01-10 17:41:11 I had similar problems, and my optometrist told me to clean them periodically with dish soap instead of rubbing the dirt/oil in and damaging them. I haven't destroyed any lenses since!
4139 2018-01-10 17:41:05 What a great time to get an oil change
4140 2018-01-10 17:40:59 oil and gas companies could comply . Just stop all oil,gas,coal to New York.
4141 2018-01-10 17:40:54 Easy solution— Oil companies will no longer sell any of their products in/to NYC.  #seehowthatworks
4142 2018-01-10 17:40:50 You need some good massage with some baby oil!
4143 2018-01-10 17:40:45 A gorgeous coast that bears an oil spill's traces
Taxpayer-funded junkets to romantic places
And still your life lacks things
Private jet things
That remind us of you
A tinkling piano in the first class compartment
Great hors d'ouerves that told you what your rank meant...

4144 2018-01-10 17:40:44 Just remembered how unhinged Trump got over windmills in the ocean visible from his Scottish golf course -- guess the thought of a oil platform off the coast of MarALago could bring down the club's rates? #msnbc
4145 2018-01-10 17:40:39 Explain “ take control “? Is he saying he wants a totalitarian govt? Where everyone works in coalmines and oil/ gas industry until the US is wasteland , wearing clothing from the DJT / Ivanka line?
4146 2018-01-10 17:40:38 The fastest growing occupations in the U.S.? Solar installers come in at #1, followed by wind turbine techs at #2. Oil and gas ranks #20 for derrick operators. Time to remove the remaining barriers (political footballs) that prevent us from building energy resilient communities.
4147 2018-01-10 17:40:31 1970s - Oil discovered off Scotland's coast and extracted.
2017 - Scotland "bankrupt" 
Westminster controlled our oil production, and controls our economic levers.
What sort of gullible, simple-minded fool would insist the best course of action is to allow Westminster control?
4148 2018-01-10 17:40:25 Dawg.. I wrote a bad review about them and they gave me a free oil change.. Main reason I went back.. so I go to pick up my car and they told me it wouldn't start 
4149 2018-01-10 17:40:21 エルザー　何怒ってんだよー？
4150 2018-01-10 17:40:17 bout to buy an oil diffuser and fill that shit w thc oil n hotbox my room
4151 2018-01-10 17:40:14 why do I still remember oil rig
4152 2018-01-10 17:40:08 これ？ドレッシングっていうか廃油。
4153 2018-01-10 17:40:02 Idk whitey, ask your ancestors
Or ask the Native Americans who have been removed from their lands, killed, and abused by Europeans in the colonial era. And till this day, their lands are being taken away by oil companies and by your dear leader.
4154 2018-01-10 17:40:00 1970s - Oil discovered off Scotland's coast and extracted.
2017s - Scotland "bankrupt" 
Westminster controlled our oil production, and controls our economic levers.
What sort of gullible, simple-minded fool would insist the best course of action is to allow Westminster control?
4155 2018-01-10 17:39:59 Lol seems so! I admire your patience Jimboman, learning lots from you!
4156 2018-01-10 17:39:53 Oil
4157 2018-01-10 17:39:45 Yeah, everyone knows New York loves its polluters and can’t wait to have it’s coastlines covered in oil and the Adirondacks turned into a landfill.
4158 2018-01-10 17:39:30 Coconut oil bath + Travis Scott playlist 
4159 2018-01-10 17:39:28 She said good news and I was so relieved!!!! Just more PT, vitamin E oil, turmeric and massages!
4160 2018-01-10 17:39:26 how do you know consumers of oil from COT?
4161 2018-01-10 17:39:23 If you cover you massage your scalp with warm oil and lie upside down for 5 minutes every day for a week your hair can grow up to 5cm in that 1 week.
Sounds fake but it’s true.
4162 2018-01-10 17:39:15 How do you get that cause even my blazer they gotta add extra oil the tank is too big and even if i do synthetic it’s only 65
4163 2018-01-10 17:39:07 We hope you will fight to protect our natural areas and resources from gas and oil development! There is so much at stake! #keepwaynewild
4164 2018-01-10 17:38:57 Hope your work calms down soon Ian !!
4165 2018-01-10 17:38:35 It's like the tobacco lawsuit, just an excuse to grab money from oil companies which will be used for Deblasio political ambitions. NYC mayor can't be what he sees as the final line on this obituary
4166 2018-01-10 17:38:34 Take a bath with some drops of tea tree oil or lavender oil and take deeps breaths, it works!
4167 2018-01-10 17:38:32 The jar is good
4168 2018-01-10 17:38:31 The GOP Tax Heist bill was a giant earmark for Corporations and those earning over $450,000 a year. Plus all of the special perks provisions - private jets, gas and oil investments, pass through real estate income. Looks and smells like earmarks for most GOPers. #GOPTAXKICKBACKS
4169 2018-01-10 17:38:29 Thanks rob 
4170 2018-01-10 17:38:26 Our beautiful 30 year old neighbor who turns out for 3 years has been sleeping with her boss (married chairman of a huge oil company) in hopes of marrying him, got dumped and now is suing, claiming sexual harassment?!
4171 2018-01-10 17:38:20 Hey, wait. Oregon wants Florida's deal too. Our entire coastline has been set aside for the public for decades. It's for everyone, not for fracking or creating oil slicks off shore like Texas has done. #Oregon #NoDrilling #TheResistance
4172 2018-01-10 17:38:16 So I’ve been rinsing my mouth with saltwater then aloe Vera I was using clove oil but it wasn’t working for too long but anbesol has been working wonders it has a numbing effect. And pain killers lol sigh I’m making a dentist appointment too
4173 2018-01-10 17:38:15 #Turkey & #Oil & #MichaelFlynn is everything against the USA and conspiring and #colluding with #ISIS 
Whole bunch of top 1% making tons of #Billions of money   
Not one peep of effort to stop by #POTUS45 #GOP or #Republicans , now known by the masses as Republikkkans!!!
@CNN
4174 2018-01-10 17:38:15 Should’ve gotten my oil changed first though, they gone take forever 
4175 2018-01-10 17:38:06 You guys are the best 
4176 2018-01-10 17:38:03 @ProtoDubs I wonder if Grease will have the same transformation as Cross Z Charge. Black greasy oil spewing out the top of his head making his armor. Also I wonder how they will do Kamen Rider Rogue’s transformation and when.
4177 2018-01-10 17:37:52 UK onshore oil and gas regs, such as they are, are not gold standard but gold plated - appearances are everything.
4178 2018-01-10 17:37:47 I would probably use linseed oil. X

4180 2018-01-10 17:37:39 No drilling for oil off Florida because Donny Dotard doesn't want oil befouling the shores of Mar A Lago.  He included the rest of Florida to disguise his true purpose.
4181 2018-01-10 17:37:35 ｜ω◉)ｴｯ

残念ながらまだですｗ
4182 2018-01-10 17:37:34 What about the Cascadia Subduction Zone off our Oregon coast?? And the new underwater volcano erupting lately near Astoria? ... These geologic features don't preclude off shore oil drilling?
Sounds like a terrible idea, possibly dangerous to the planet, even, to me...
Geologists?
4183 2018-01-10 17:37:33 coconut oil witch hazel and rose water?
4184 2018-01-10 17:37:33 Put oregano oil over it, keep it there for about a minute and spit out the rest. Numbs it for some hours
4185 2018-01-10 17:37:23 or the time me and kiara tried to change my oil and used the money my dad gave me for weed.. #unkshit
4186 2018-01-10 17:37:21 Il faudrait qu'elles soient "largement en baisse". Heureusement, grâce au changement climatique, il y aura plus de vent...
4187 2018-01-10 17:37:20 I LOVE GETTING MY OIL CHANGED AND THEN THEM TELLING ME MY CARS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE WHATSOEVER BC OF MY WHEEL BARING
4188 2018-01-10 17:37:16 jesis i burnt my forehead wit teatree oil too :<
4189 2018-01-10 17:37:08 But you're always reminded the oil one works right
4190 2018-01-10 17:37:03 froze the rally ..we are about to see a big dump soon:)
4191 2018-01-10 17:37:00 can you do something 2 STOP trumps deal to Drill off the NYC coast.The LAST thing we need is OIL spills on our beaches @NYGovCuomo
4192 2018-01-10 17:36:59 Oh good. Now you can close it down and drill for oil in it. Gotcha!
4193 2018-01-10 17:36:54 We are seeing the oil companies grasping drilling rights and signaling we will die from burning fossil fuels before changing to renewables.
4194 2018-01-10 17:36:45 @lisamurkowski “Many studies have estimated that leaks from oil and gas production, particularly fracking, are a major driver of rising methane emissions.” Drilling the #ArcticRefuge will contribute to this critical issue. #protectthearctic #KeepItInTheGround #protectouroceans
4195 2018-01-10 17:36:41 I took a look at it, did some research. It looks like they weren't following Proper safety regulations. So this incident was totally avoidable. So we simply enforce our safety regulations with an iron fist. Oil platforms are safe, and have little to no impact on the environment.
4196 2018-01-10 17:36:38 @realDonaldTrump I don’t understand why you are trusting the snake oil salesmen of Congress to do what is best for America and its citizens. #DrainTheSwamp #DACA is bad for the country
4197 2018-01-10 17:36:34 It's a sham. @realDonaldTrump doesn't want oil rigs out in front of Mara Lego.
4198 2018-01-10 17:36:32 a struck oil filter?
4199 2018-01-10 17:36:29 Clans isn't too long. No longer than Great Western Trail. I'm going to read the rules to Hunt for the Ring and bring it as well. I have Peak Oil I need to read rules for as well
4200 2018-01-10 17:36:20 What is baby oil even used for? As if babies need to become MORE droppable.
4201 2018-01-10 17:36:18 HELLOOO.  Can you say Mar-a-Lago??  Palm beach - oil platforms?  Never.
4202 2018-01-10 17:36:14 NYC nanny state sues oil firms "climate change is a complex societal challenge that should be addressed through sound government policy and cultural change to drive low-carbon choices for businesses and consumers, not by the courts." - Let’s counter sue NYC for default bailouts!
4203 2018-01-10 17:36:08 I liked Tiff’s analogy of us having the oil, designed the automobile, but no quite got the roads in place (paraphrased)
4204 2018-01-10 17:36:08 Big Oil should try to bankrupt NYC in this suit.
4205 2018-01-10 17:36:01 soon they will experience the catastrophs of oil drilling
4206 2018-01-10 17:35:58 An “orderly exit” as they called it! From my understanding its due to energy being scarce right now in China due to a dry season, and also an oil & gas supply bottleneck.
4207 2018-01-10 17:35:53 Olbas oil on the download
4208 2018-01-10 17:35:37 Oil changed and a good haircut, I’m ready for anything now.
4209 2018-01-10 17:35:31 They already came up with - "protect the Indo-Asia-Pacific shipping lanes" including the Strait of Malacca (wink, wink - oil & natural gas reserves) and oil shipping) as part of the militarization aspects of Obama's Pivot to Asia initiatives.
4210 2018-01-10 17:35:31 Listen to dupstep while you oil pull
4211 2018-01-10 17:35:27 i chemically burned my forehead with tea tree oil and toner my life is a mess
4212 2018-01-10 17:35:23 For tighter curls you need more hydrating/protein hair masks. So try doing an avocado, honey, banana, olive oil, egg, & mayo mask, it helps revive your curl pattern. Also shea moisture’s styling milk & their Jamaican black castor oil leave in.
4213 2018-01-10 17:34:54 I use grapeseed oil which I also got at dischem for R50(250ml) but there's another one from Nutri Women (even-derm) it's R265(50ml) so it's better if you use the oil... I have really sensitive skin so if I didn't react badly you're probably safe.. Also always use sunscreen
4214 2018-01-10 17:34:25 Muammar Khaddafi through the oil money did what the world thought impossible - he made farming possible in the desert. He made free housing a possibility for the Libyan. Education was free. Yet he was killed because he was greedy and selfish. I am confused!
4215 2018-01-10 17:34:17 Really? Is that why OUR PRESIDENT TRUMP banned oil drilling off the coast of Florida?
4216 2018-01-10 17:34:16 I like de Blasio but this is dumb. This is just as dumb as activists suing Apple because their kids are addicted to their phones or suing McDonalds because you are too many cheeseburgers.  Just DUMB!!  The oil and gas industry provides a necessary service.
4217 2018-01-10 17:34:11 And maybe so there wouldn’t be an oil rig off mar a lago.
4218 2018-01-10 17:34:10 Maybe we should propose some oil wells just off the coast of his Trump National golf course then he might listen?
4219 2018-01-10 17:34:07 Soon we’re going to have oil spills.
4220 2018-01-10 17:34:01 I think Warren Buffett should start buying cryptocurrency and use it for major purchases like crude oil Commodities big purchases like for Arrow defense purchasing big planes buildings cryptocurrency can have a big play in it invest in Bitcoin
4221 2018-01-10 17:33:36 They screwed up the blend a lot of it gelled. Diesel and Heating oil
4222 2018-01-10 17:33:31 So it would mean that measured by GNP the country was much poorer than GDP.  Nationalisation of the oil companies came in the mid 70's
4223 2018-01-10 17:33:29 That cold spell was brutal, feels like summer now 
4224 2018-01-10 17:33:17 @AndrewHolnessJM i think to reduce time the government should set up program where they could buy illegal guns from off the street and sell it to other country that is interested. also to seek partnership with overseas oil company to reduce the price on oil importation
4225 2018-01-10 17:33:12 I guess $50 is the new norm for a synthetic oil change 
4226 2018-01-10 17:33:10 仕事は家内に頑張ってもらいます。僕はひたすら享楽につとめます。
4227 2018-01-10 17:33:10 Yoga oil is gross
4228 2018-01-10 17:33:09 I love how the same people who pollute the water with oil and garbage, the air with toxicity, and feed chemicals into animals get a couple hours of rain, then ask nature to give THEM a break.
4229 2018-01-10 17:33:03 We should drill and cheer for an oil spill off Florida because Trump is President. That’s true resistance!
4230 2018-01-10 17:32:49 i saw some youtube rant in like 2007 about video game graphics and the line "throw some olive oil on the screen while playing a ps2 game, there now it's a ps3 game" has stayed with me my whole life
4231 2018-01-10 17:32:44 There was cold spell last week in the US...that affected production.
4232 2018-01-10 17:32:43 Lol a picture isn't an air quality test or a water pollution test. And what are the numbers on how many lithium mine's vs oil refineries and drill locations there are? Ridiculous. Also, once the battery is made it no longer pollutes. Nice try though
4233 2018-01-10 17:32:42 But the geologically unstable west coast is open for oil drilling. These guys are unbelievably corrupt.
4234 2018-01-10 17:32:33 هو لازم تكون فيه لو شي بسيط من هذه الصفات لتستقيم الحياة
4235 2018-01-10 17:32:29 It's a made up recipe using Gram flour, baking powder, plant milk and seasoning. Making a pouring batter. Hot tin with oil.
4236 2018-01-10 17:32:25 I have drained and pressed the #tofu, and put it in a #soysauce, #sesame oil, #ginger, #garlic #marinade.

4237 2018-01-10 17:32:01 Hahahhahaa tak pernah tapi before kami try hada labo dulu memang kami baca review cleansing oil lain dulu, and biore mmg boleh breakout kalau tak kena muka org tu
4238 2018-01-10 17:31:46 Drilling for oil in ANWR or anywhere in the Arctic with permafrost or ice is idiotic.  Oil spills cannot be cleaned up under ice.  @realDonaldTrump
4239 2018-01-10 17:31:41 Pls remain him not to forget the annoiting oil,pastor will be using it for deliverance service. Thank you
4240 2018-01-10 17:31:39 Nice visualisations... not sure I'll agree on his statement of 4th reacher country in earth. Oil concessions meant that most revenues in the 50th would go to transnational companies
4241 2018-01-10 17:31:31 "Goldman Says Cryptocurrencies May Succeed as Form of Real Money"  estos fueron los que vieron el OIL a 200 cuando estaba en 130
4242 2018-01-10 17:31:31 .@SenNanOrrock on the floor: GA lawmakers must “be at the table” in the national conversation on coastal drilling. “GA is the only state not to weigh in” on the Trump admin decision to open our nation’s coastlines to oil drilling. @100milesGA #ProtectOurCoast

4244 2018-01-10 17:31:15 I’m getting my oil changed and my phone is on 3%. No one told me life would be this hard.
4245 2018-01-10 17:31:12 We are boiling the 7 mountains of the universe in the anointing oil and the throne of grace is the burner.
4246 2018-01-10 17:31:08 After two years #oil price increased.
Waiting for #oilandgas #requirement
4247 2018-01-10 17:31:05 My potato roasting days are over considering a just burnt my eyelid with hot oil
4248 2018-01-10 17:31:05 Any girl that thinks oil will keep me.... Don't be deceived.....

4250 2018-01-10 17:31:00 A gusher at Spindletop Hill near Beaumont, Texas coated the landscape all around the derrick with crude #OTD in 1901, marking the start of the American oil industry. #TexasTea #BlackGold
4251 2018-01-10 17:30:57 I always have to go get my car washed after an oil change cause I feel like the mechanics are 1000000% judging me 
4252 2018-01-10 17:30:55 that was then this is now it can be changed now reform needs to be put in place to help unemployed low income also create jobs price control and inflation need to stop spending in Syria Lebanon Iraq yeman oil money should be spent on IRANIAN people
4253 2018-01-10 17:30:53 The offshore oil drilling memo is the most alarming to me. Even without climate change, oil drilling and fracking is prohibitively destructive to natural resources and industries like fishing, tourism. We need to be investing in renewables. #makeamericagreater
4254 2018-01-10 17:30:52 Most oil filter size been included?
4255 2018-01-10 17:30:44 try making a hair mask (like a deep conditioner) to use before or in the shower, and try to put castor oil (hair growth), almond oil (strength and thickness) and coconut oil (hydration and shine) and any other things u want to add but thats how i maintain my hair!
4256 2018-01-10 17:30:40 Nice Intraday Reversal on #DGOC and did Bullish Engulfing Candle - I'm assuming Oil price been perky again.  @Agneshkel
4257 2018-01-10 17:30:38 จากตอนแรกที่ค่อนข้างเฉย แต่พอฟังเพลงเขาบ่อยๆ ดันเป็นแฟนเพลงเขาไปโดยไม่รู้ตัว แหะๆ 
4258 2018-01-10 17:30:36 Price of oil goes up a lil and everyone goes to buying shit they don't need. No. I'm not tryna buy a boat rn broski.
4259 2018-01-10 17:30:34 Obama didn’t have to give up clean air and water, decrease national monuments, open our beautiful coastline to oil drilling or give rich people tax cuts to improve the economy. I don’t think these compromises are worth any gains made in an already good economy.
4260 2018-01-10 17:30:28 The reality is: millions would die from hunger and cold if not for the evil oil companies.
4261 2018-01-10 17:30:23 The reason it's so important for them to drill in ANWR isn't because of the oil, it's because of what it represents . If you won't deny them there, where can you deny them?
"Come on, we're already drilling in a WILDLIFE REFUGE!"
4262 2018-01-10 17:30:23 There is a big difference Saudi production is real oil. US production is real crude and a lot of condensate. About 2 MM barrels/day higher than API gravity higher than 45
4263 2018-01-10 17:30:21 No oil drilling off Florida bc it would hurt Republican gubernatorial candidate. Oil drilling in ANWR to help Sen Murkowski. Are all decisions on environmental protection or destruction now just based on what helps local Republicans?

4265 2018-01-10 17:30:05 Yes i use various magnesium products, oil, lotion, diy body butter, foot bath. 
I can’t say it helps massively bt it’s sposed to be good for Pain n all that. If u can bothered to make ur own can add ur fave essential oils
4266 2018-01-10 17:29:57 The closer the wick is to the oil the longer it will burn and Problems occur if the wick is not fully saturated.
4267 2018-01-10 17:29:53 “Struggling oil sector”. That’s rich
4268 2018-01-10 17:29:46 Debt servicing or debt incurred?
We are on fx debt incurred by GEJ vs PMB.
GEJ:Debt from $3.45b - $10.3b(Despite huge oil receipts)FxR:$45b down $29.3b

PMB:Debt from $10.37b -$15.3b(low oil receipt)
FxR:$29.3 up $40.3b($3b for domestic debt refinancing).

Kudos doesn't kill
4269 2018-01-10 17:29:39 Surely they missed out the decimal point in the middle. Wow that would be brilliant. Is that the work of Sanllehi. Looks like he could sell oil to the arabs.
4270 2018-01-10 17:29:38 Apparently, this wasn’t shopped around to the states to be effected by the decision. What a shocker, they didn’t do any homework. Seems big oil told them what they want, and were given the same. So much for states rights, again.
4271 2018-01-10 17:29:37 Anyone use Alikay Naturals Essential 17 Hair Growth Oil?
4272 2018-01-10 17:29:31 . Sorry about the oil
4273 2018-01-10 17:29:27 Only they have... They have approved many oil gas and chemicals projects. Is it really up to me to prove to you that the the real world exists? That opposition political dogma does not define reality? 
All the projects on that site have been approved. Many after 2015.
4274 2018-01-10 17:29:13 Blame the customer—exactly what tobacco industry did. (And consumers of oil have even less choice.)
4275 2018-01-10 17:29:10 The good ole' days! When purity mattered. They had a hellouva Cannabis oil too

4283 2018-01-10 17:28:22 @NYGovCuomo Maybe the oil companies should close all gas station in NY so they don’t continue to damage the ambient.

4286 2018-01-10 17:28:16 Any update on that burning oil tanker?
4287 2018-01-10 17:28:01 The gall of it, just after Florida has been taken off the list for oil & gas development by corrupt-to-the-bone-Zinke on we know whose orders. 
4288 2018-01-10 17:28:00 Glad I’m down here in Florida where our politicians would sell their souls for a Trump  endorsement.  See Rick Scott for Senate and Ron DeSantis for governor.  They’re getting some help with that oil drilling too.
4289 2018-01-10 17:27:59 Firm believer that coconut oil is literal skin crack 
4290 2018-01-10 17:27:42 Showered, bout to take a quick nap & get this oil change
4291 2018-01-10 17:27:32 @jgavinxcelerate I notice you make a great deal of the "entourage effect" of your CBD concentrate oil and claims that it is not an extract. However your data sheet appears to contradict you. Taken from your very own data sheet:

"Celtic Wind CBD Multi-Complex Extract Hemp Oil"
4292 2018-01-10 17:27:31 We should drive up there in snowmobiles and take the oil!
4293 2018-01-10 17:27:31 In the 60's my Mom was denied a job as geologist with oil company because they'd have to get a separate porta- potty. Is this what they mean by we've come a long way baby?
4294 2018-01-10 17:27:30 Do they have enough massage oil for when they go around the table?
4295 2018-01-10 17:27:28 Also a great "oil site"--the ocean floor about 1/4 mile off the Mar-a-lago beach.
4296 2018-01-10 17:27:20 my card declined when i got my oil changed. I'm some how not freaking out. go me?
4297 2018-01-10 17:27:19 Didn’t know it was hair.. well in that case Cantu shea moisture .. use some almond oil
4298 2018-01-10 17:27:10 Hey thanks! I’ll look into that! I mostly use oil paints because I can create a bit more fluid looking stuff with it. I’m not a very good painter though so I have to struggle for a while to make anything look halfway passable.
4299 2018-01-10 17:27:07 Every time I change oil, I will also change the oil filter. Is it OK to replace the oil alone but keep the used oil filter there?
4300 2018-01-10 17:27:06 The great state of Illinois will soon become an oil and gas pipeline catastrophe just like the coal industry left it
4301 2018-01-10 17:27:02 I use pureology for my shampoo and conditioner. I shower every 2 to 3 days. When I get out of the shower I put frizz ease all over my hair and use coconut milk oil and agave on just my tips. Blow dry then use heat protectant then straighten then put this other oil That makes it
4302 2018-01-10 17:27:01 Reality President, what infomercials are going to be the sponsors? We know Big Oil, Investment Banks, Big Pharma and the list goes on.
4303 2018-01-10 17:26:58 In NL no one is mandated to pay severance under Labour Law in the best of times let alone the worst. I'm more concerned with "No Lay Off" clause. So if a barrell of oil drops again & our financial situation worsens the largest public service in Canada cannot be right-sized??
4304 2018-01-10 17:26:57 It was dat pussy or oil sucka
4305 2018-01-10 17:26:57 A ver canario retardado, si esto fuera un gobierno comunista en lugar de subsidiarte el Gas Oil y darte ayuda económica cuando se te inunda o se te seca el campo, te habrían expropiado las tierras para dársela a trabajadores para q vivan  y no para ir de vacaciones a Europa.
4306 2018-01-10 17:26:56 Exactly!! Lmao!! And they gonna have oil, chicken, and weed! And they gonna set out the “i want yo line sister” and “meat to meat” hops lmao. So predictable! Every Omega Psi Phi founders day goes the same exact way 
4307 2018-01-10 17:26:55 3/3 know this, we’re encouraging our kids to go into trades that are more diversified, so they have options when the inevitable happens. The rise and fall in oil is NOT any govt’s fault. Diversification is good for our kids. Meeting carbon goals is a must for world business.
4308 2018-01-10 17:26:40 China would lack capacity to drill oil at all were it not for US tech.
4309 2018-01-10 17:26:39 And of course NYC politicians won't go after Russia or China - the ones with the largest oil companies.

4316 2018-01-10 17:25:39 And we’ll make sure not one drop comes your way. They you can walk your fat ass everywhere you have go. And I’m sure you don’t use any of hundreds of products that are made with the use of oil.
4317 2018-01-10 17:25:38 Whoa! The price of oil hits a 2-year high.
4318 2018-01-10 17:25:37 The purpose of this service is to get extra oil to go the extra mile. Oil in the lamp keeps you burning for a while; oil in the jar keeps you burning the extra mile.

4319 2018-01-10 17:25:31 It seems very tasteless to dig up all those old churchyards just because the residents have turned into coal and oil.
4320 2018-01-10 17:25:30 Why is Florida no longer apart of the new oil drilling off the coast of the US?
4321 2018-01-10 17:25:27 Ima miss dem free oil changes 
4322 2018-01-10 17:25:19 Chinese have been stealing Gulf Coast oil for years, with miles long slanted drilling rigs. Ships just past US territorial waters, rigs slanted into US waters. If US did to China, they would seize ships.
4323 2018-01-10 17:25:09 What gets me is the populist anti bank drain the swamp guys who elected trump and these loons will ignore clearly corrupt stuff like waivers for fines to banks like Deutche and offshore drilling that only benefits the oil companies
4324 2018-01-10 17:25:04 If I were a major oil company I would stop selling my product in New York.
4325 2018-01-10 17:25:01 Oil drilling off their coast couldn’t have helped either or sessions pot crack down 
4326 2018-01-10 17:25:01 Argan oil hair masks always work super good and are really cheap!!!!
4327 2018-01-10 17:25:00 Saudi Aramco is having problems valuation problems which could be of good news to China as to a lower valuation the cheaper it is to purchase it, but as long as oil pushes higher the US oil industry with fracking technology will pushback that hike.
4328 2018-01-10 17:24:52 virtually no one investing in crypto understands crypto other than the words "it's the future!" Not even the CNBC talking heads, it's just been going up, so they are buying it. Just like I don't understand oil drilling.
4329 2018-01-10 17:24:40 Ze no good. The oil pressure sensor is mounted in front of the block. It’s very easily accessible. Check the wire that goes to it. Its a small wire and I’ve seen the wire break

4338 2018-01-10 17:24:16 Just read that the oil industry no longer has to pay into a fund to clean up oil spills! Really sick.  How much $$ did U get from the Koch Brothers? @DavidHKoch "Sad".
4339 2018-01-10 17:24:15 Oil, oil, oil.  Didn't work in Iraq.   Won't work in Iran.

4362 2018-01-10 17:22:31 Zinke's statement seems to insinuate that because of tourism as an economic driver in Florida, off-shore oil drilling is not compatible. Why would that not be the case in any other location? The abusive attitude of the trump Administration to the environment is boundless.
4363 2018-01-10 17:22:28 Ok so I gotta ask 3callsaday. Are you saying if we put an oil rig and pipeline along the “Gorda Plate” California will slide off into the ocean? 3callsaday to a psychiatrist I hope. I HOPE your liberal whacked out Gavin Newsome goes live with that argument

4366 2018-01-10 17:22:22 Timber companies log on federal land for pennies.  That seems like a subsidy. Oil and coal were asking for US subsidies.
4367 2018-01-10 17:22:20 It's worrying when one industry leader like Jamie Dimon and another like Buffet take opposite stands. From a common sense standpoint Bitcoin is snake oil.
4368 2018-01-10 17:22:04 It took an embarrassingly long time. The key I found was (a) not to be afraid of it and (b) let it sit after.
1. Medium high heat for the olive oil. While that's going,
2. Wash, pat dry, and flavor the chicken. I like salt and garlic powder.
3. Let the chicken sit. The salt -

4370 2018-01-10 17:21:54 Wide range of livery companies seem involved in wood mongering & oil trade, and skinners seem remarkably flexible as to products

4372 2018-01-10 17:21:38 I question how you could accept a bribe of oil drilling in Alaska and in return accept tax cuts for your donors and a dismantling of health care for opioid users. #hypocrite
4373 2018-01-10 17:21:26 @realDonaldTrump If you want off shore drilling, LEAD by example and allow drilling off florida in YOUR OWN BACK GARDEN.  Show your support for the oil industry first hand by allowing it off Mar-a-largo's coast.
4374 2018-01-10 17:21:24 That is because the big oil companies know there is no appreciable oil there to make it profitable.

4380 2018-01-10 17:20:31 You seem to believe your loyalty oath to poTUs is your job, WRONG! You work for We The People! We dont want OIL DRILLING AT ALL! Greedy SOB!
4381 2018-01-10 17:20:28 Just poul-try to understand that it's clucking important in a number of fields. Oil be here if you want to talk about it.
4382 2018-01-10 17:20:20 Please keep that oil drilling to yourselves we don't want it here in florida no way...
4383 2018-01-10 17:20:16 Pourquoi ne pas laisser sa voiture là où on se trouve pour réussir à bloquer toutes nos villes de France on fait cela jusqu'à obtention d'une baisse du prix du gaz oïl. Il vont pas nous verbaliser tout de même
4384 2018-01-10 17:20:12 I believe that pure godly good oil  had me giving it to her for that long. Ended up sweating
4385 2018-01-10 17:20:06 Precious metals, miners, copper and oil all should move lower with rise in dollar?

4387 2018-01-10 17:19:20 When I go to mechanic shops I walk in there like “look homie just change my oil, don’t tell me shit else bout a transmission flush or something, change my oil fuck boys”
4388 2018-01-10 17:19:19 If your man doesn’t change the oil to your car, he ain’t the one
4389 2018-01-10 17:19:18 オイルがあるから、みんな生きているんだYO
4390 2018-01-10 17:19:17 can I add like vitamin E oil or just use it alone?
4391 2018-01-10 17:19:12 I need to get my oil changed today I’ve been BSn for a very long time
4392 2018-01-10 17:19:01 I wasn't talking about Barca - I know they're a members-owned multisports club. I was talking about the dirty money looted by human rights-abusing oil sheik dictatorships and Russian gangsters that buys the likes of Man City, PSG & Chelsea their trophies.
4393 2018-01-10 17:19:00  get some anointing oil.
4394 2018-01-10 17:18:52 Went to beaches in Texas - Hotels have to provide feet cleaner to get oil off your feet. Please keep California and Florida beaches clean of oil !
4395 2018-01-10 17:18:52 Just called: operator told me to call 202-208-7351, instead. Left msg to keep NC coasts free & #cleanenergy leaders. No oil drilling off our emerald coasts. We #rememberBP devastation off gulf. No thanks.
4396 2018-01-10 17:18:41 You could apply Zinke's statement to almost any state (removing the hurricane reference)  California for example has massive whale migration and oil exploration affects that massively plus @MontereyAq  ocean conservation work is priceless & necessary for the world.
4397 2018-01-10 17:18:39 Then opened her for oil drilling?
4398 2018-01-10 17:18:37 Pulled up to Jiffy lube to get my oil an shit changed & my nigga Akil getting me out the way 
4399 2018-01-10 17:18:34 Major Oil Companies should stop selling Gas and Oil in NYC..... they don't need it if it's bad for them.
4400 2018-01-10 17:18:30 Me withhold aid?? Trump and his republicans took care of that when they put in their tax bill to stop the tax on oil that goes into the fund!! You misunderstood what I said completely!!

4403 2018-01-10 17:18:13 Double oil papers for slow burning 
4404 2018-01-10 17:18:07 Think it is time all those boat owners start going out and putting a protective ring around our coast in protest. I would rather look at boats rather than worry about oil spills coming onto the beach.
4405 2018-01-10 17:18:07 and my honest apologies for sounding snarky Trevor, but this is frustrating. Hubby is 51 and has worked oil his entire career. He lost his job in 2015- before NDP- and at best had low paying part time work until recently, when business began to boom again. we weren’t going 1/2
4406 2018-01-10 17:18:05 @MaticaMMJ @BoZiger If you guys start offering Cannabis oil like Cannabis shatter is right now on the black market but with co2 etc then you're looking at very very good money. Here's to good things.
4407 2018-01-10 17:17:51 Poisons on your vegetables and fruit. Oil and mercury in our fish.
4408 2018-01-10 17:17:48 I’m no professional but I’m pretty sure an oil change shouldn’t take over an hour to do

4410 2018-01-10 17:17:42 Crown Fastflow satin, it really does feel and look like oil, it's awesome., but the downside to all waster based, it will always be soft and not hard wearing, ( i never use in Halls and stairs for this reason) It's about time @Brewerspaints started stocking the fastflow range.
4411 2018-01-10 17:17:41 Clear! was the value of the franchise increasing A, B, Or C? I wasn't in Edmonton at the time Katz bought the Oil, plus at my age.... last week could have been last month, a few years ago, could have been 2002
4412 2018-01-10 17:17:39 @orlandosentinel @pbpost Oil drilling, FL&self interests. Come on, get real.....this isnt about the governor...it's about MIRALAGO!!!
4413 2018-01-10 17:17:34 @RonWyden I have great concern over the drilling off our coast for oil. We could lose huge amounts of money if our shores are fouled, and we could lose so much of what makes Oregon special! Please fight against this sick legislation and protect our shorelines!
4414 2018-01-10 17:17:30 I wish more arenas had that (glares at Chicago). I love when schedules work out perfectly and I can see lots of teams/leagues in one go. In 5 days in Alberta, I saw the Oilers, Oil Kings, Flames and Hitmen!

4416 2018-01-10 17:17:27 Lavar Ball is a DAILY news story on many of the sports networks and blogs because he doesn't mind speaking what's on his mind, yet somehow he's the "snake oil salesman?" Strange how these labels are always thrown out to people they "claim" not to like.
4417 2018-01-10 17:17:24 This administration has reversed the oil drilling plan for Florida only because he doesn’t want Mar-a-Lago to be affected. #DonTheCon #25thAmendmentNow #MuellerTime
4418 2018-01-10 17:17:21 Ask your self. Can we live with out oil? 

The answer is No.
Unless we stop transportation of every kind.
4419 2018-01-10 17:17:00 The lunch I made today included the recommended daily portion of 55% vegetables with a tbsp of Extra Virgin Olive Oil.

When am I getting the superpowers? I'm just gonna wake up with em tomorrow or...?
4420 2018-01-10 17:16:51 USA, on the other hand, is moving back to oil and coal.
4421 2018-01-10 17:16:48 I had no idea! I just commissioned an amazing oil painting from her, based on a photo of my boss based out in a dog door. It's hilarious and brilliant, just like her.
4422 2018-01-10 17:16:43 It is as well as this is Coastal California here in the 49th. We do not want or need oil drilling here.
4423 2018-01-10 17:16:25 Perhaps trump incentive to vote his way or you’ll get oil wells on your beautiful beaches.

4425 2018-01-10 17:16:23 Simple.  Make the numerous offshore oil rigs tourist friendly destinations.  

There.  #figureditoutinfiveseconds
4426 2018-01-10 17:16:20 We don’t want to see oil platforms from Mar-A-Largo. We just want those assholes in the NE to see em.
4427 2018-01-10 17:16:19 @mitchellreports get a clue please: Mar-a-Lago is on coast and oil rig would ruin view for Trump! Politics has very little to do with exemption for Florida.
4428 2018-01-10 17:16:16 Cory Gardner what kind of idiot are you,is it the money you receive from the high on pot lobby what is our country coming to,use the pot oil for  medicine not to smoke it
4429 2018-01-10 17:16:14 Since the last week of August I have gone from 235LBs to 188Lbs. Reduced my carb intake and greatly increase high quality fat intake. If you are a coffee drinker, add grass fed butter and mct oil instead of sugary creamers. Increasing good fats WILL eliminate those cravings.
4430 2018-01-10 17:16:12 This is a thread about offshore oil drilling and its economic consequences for Florida. 

Gov. Scott has not done enough to protect FL, its environment, its business, or its people. Scott is only doing the bare minimum so he can pad his resume for a senate run #Florida
4431 2018-01-10 17:16:10 How many ml's is your rosehip oil from the pure luxe oil range? It's so cheap  @CoriumSkincare
4432 2018-01-10 17:15:42 Bottom line is Trump didn’t want  rigs and oil spills in front and on his property.
4433 2018-01-10 17:15:41 We had our first  sweet potato wedges of the year yesterday.. Literally just a spoon of olive oil,salt and pepper and stick on low oven
4434 2018-01-10 17:15:40 .@SenBillNelson if your concern with oil drilling is the environment then a simple "THANK YOU" to @FLGovScott would be appropriate. Clearly your motives are political. #DrainTheSwamp
4435 2018-01-10 17:15:39 Good. I was worried. 

I'm sure I'll use it up.  I think the processor was too big for the amount I tried to make, then I added the oil too fast.
4436 2018-01-10 17:15:38 But I'm just a humble oil and biomass engineer...
4437 2018-01-10 17:15:37 Stop depending on foreign oil.

4442 2018-01-10 17:15:17 On this day in 1870, John D. Rockefeller incorporated Standard Oil.  And on this same day in 1901, the largest oil strike ever made, the Spindletop field near Beaumont, TX, was made.
4443 2018-01-10 17:15:17 You only just beat Bristol at home mate in front of a packed crowd ooppsss . Listen not arsed your club is shit you have no fans never be as big as us ... all you have is oil that’s it
4444 2018-01-10 17:15:16 That’s ridiculous as hell. Message to oil companies- stop selling oil products to NY. See how that does. The rest of the country will be fine. Cut California off too. They both are shit holes.
4445 2018-01-10 17:15:16 I've just started to drink straight black coffee w/MCT oil. Hard to change not adding 30 lbs of sugar and cream at first but I feel way better now. Try it out! I get my stuff from @CavemanCoffeeCo .
4446 2018-01-10 17:15:15 The coffee increases blood circulation and plumps up the skin making the cellulite less visible, the sugar scrubs away dry cells and the coconut oil moisturizes. I do it in the shower, circular motions, then rinse. Leaves you smelling incredible too.
4447 2018-01-10 17:15:13 I absolutely love my products!! I’m obsessed with everything. I didn’t realize how much I would love the Laura Mercier cleansing oil, but I’m obsessed with it!! But the primer and foundation are to die for! Loved seeing you! Can’t wait to go back 
4448 2018-01-10 17:15:12 @mitchellreports @MichaelSteele Oil drilling, FL&self interests. Come on, get real.....this isnt about the governor...it's about MIRALAGO!!! @USATODAY

4452 2018-01-10 17:14:45 Of course the price of oil and the Ft. Mcmurray fires had nothing to do with it. Carbon tax is up and gas prices are down. Slowly getting out of the mess that the Conservatives put us in.

4470 2018-01-10 17:12:35 In this country they will let it go to court and Ny will win then an appeal will happen and the oil companies will win.. So all of new york needs to stop using gas for their cars or to heat their homes they need to burn wood to stay warm but i will sue for that less oxygen
4471 2018-01-10 17:12:28 I wanna design ridiculous buildings in the middle East with oil money made on the backs of Indian and North Korean migrant slaves is thAT SO HARD
4472 2018-01-10 17:12:17 South Africa - Did and does DAFF-RSA agree to a Dairy Manufacturing (Commercial) Company and or Companies. Including Vegetable Oil MORE than 40 (% m/m) to a Substance known as Full Fat Modified Butter Spread. To 50% (%m/m)? Likewise still declare this as Butter Spread?
@DAFF_ZA
4473 2018-01-10 17:11:48 I mean, 'no exploration success' is a little contrived given that they have a flowing well at HH, oil recovered at BB and strong preliminary OIP estimates from SLB and Nutech. I do agree they need to be careful with the old readies though!

4478 2018-01-10 17:11:30 I’ll give you that. I hadn’t lost faith, but I was quite uneasy sitting down to watch game 3 in Edmonton. What a critical Monday evening it turned out to be! For both clubs. 20 points separating us and the Oil spill now.
4479 2018-01-10 17:11:24 *a random thought at 4am*
 If you really think about it butter and vegetable oil is  pretty much just food lube

4512 2018-01-10 17:08:58 The oil pipelines that were forced across Native lans are leaking right NOW! There is no "safe way".
4513 2018-01-10 17:08:52 Read an article yesterday that said they had plenty of oil, problem has been drivers.
4514 2018-01-10 17:08:51 DiBlasio/Stringer. Two fools on a fools' errand. The premise that the oil cos are responsible for global warming is preposterous and the courts have thrown out similar suits. But hey, it's other people's money funding the lawsuit, so let's have fun and burnish our creds.
4515 2018-01-10 17:08:38 You don’t really know trauma until you’ve burped up a half-digested fish oil capsule that leaks its contents as it slides through your throat. #IllNeverBeTheSame #TastesLikeDrinkingBaitJuice
4516 2018-01-10 17:08:29 I suggest switching out the maracuja oil for the serum babes
4517 2018-01-10 17:08:23 A very bad idea like offshore oil drilling is bad everywhere.  Nothing special about Florida.
4518 2018-01-10 17:08:05 The dealership called and said it needed a new oil pump and i told my mom to just throw the whole car away , she cut into me so fast  called me ungrateful and everything 
4519 2018-01-10 17:07:53 Fuel Oil: Strong selling on ample prompt supplies plus sluggish demand dragged spreads, cracks refining margins lower albeit thin volumes - rising crude weighed on front month fuel oil crack, sending it to lowest since Nov 2016.
4520 2018-01-10 17:07:51 Maybe a Saag Paneer Pie.....
4521 2018-01-10 17:07:44 @RepTomMacArthur please get our state off the list for oil drilling just like Florida just got removed. An oil spill would destroy our shoreline and the tourism dollars it brings us.
4522 2018-01-10 17:07:30 NYC sues 5 big oil cos:  BP, $CVX, $XOM, $COP, Royal Dutch Shell claiming they contributed to global warming.
4523 2018-01-10 17:07:23 It is! (The palm oil probably isn't very healthy for you, but the flavor is AMAZING!) #commchat
4524 2018-01-10 17:07:21 I started getting my gas at Speedway, because people said @BP_plc (BP) gas has oil in it. And that oil can mess up your car. 

Then I transferred from @Speedway to @Shell, because Speedway always hassles me about a “Speedway Card”. #IJustWantGas
4525 2018-01-10 17:07:21 @BahiCosmetics if I’m using a moisturizer, rose water, and tarte’s maracuja oil in my skin care routine when would be the best to apply the sunflowers serum?? Before or after those products and how many times a day?
4526 2018-01-10 17:07:13 New York City sues 5 major oil companies, claiming they contributed to global warming.
4527 2018-01-10 17:07:12 Esquimaux consume enormous quantities. Nuts are generally rich in oil.
4528 2018-01-10 17:07:09 Imagine how fucked Miami would be if the beach turned into an oil spill. This is purely about tourism money.
4529 2018-01-10 17:07:07 Salad is awesome and infinitely variable. Make it colourful and find a nice dressing. With Dijon and a yummy vinegar like champagne or verjus blanc, you don’t need much oil.
4530 2018-01-10 17:06:58 I would test spot MTG and don’t slather him the first day. I had a horse that it burned all his hair off his face when we put it on his forelock and it took forever to grow back. But I use 50/50 coconut oil and avocado oil.
4531 2018-01-10 17:06:53 There is no more delicious smell than coconut oil
4532 2018-01-10 17:06:46 水素原子の波動関数とか縮退しまくってるけどな
4533 2018-01-10 17:06:42 The oil companies received a cut of tax designated for oil spill cleanup. When the next one happens who will pay? Why did you do this?
4534 2018-01-10 17:06:39 They’re losing money, none of them want to be in oil and gas anymore, and this wouldn’t step on emerging alternative enegery and provide a single location for climate justice initiatives- who wants to reforest all of Michigan with me?
4535 2018-01-10 17:06:33 Why this plane  sound like it need and oil change . . .
4536 2018-01-10 17:06:31 3. after washing i deep condition then wash it off. 
4. use an old top to wring out excess water then i spritz my hair (coconut oil, castor oil, conditioner, water & glycerine mix) then i use cantu shea butter leave in conditioner on it. 
5. do twists, sleep, cornrow next day.
4537 2018-01-10 17:06:18 After the day you had yesterday, we have faith that you will be a strong force in helping stop Trump's disastrous off shore oil drilling plan.
4538 2018-01-10 17:06:01 Until Rita and joke will use oil to service him and he will forget about “baby”

4540 2018-01-10 17:05:46 Use spray lite oil when cooking instead of fatty oils and butters xx
4541 2018-01-10 17:05:35 As a proud Scot and a chef with over 30yrs experience all over this wonderful planet I beg to differ. Good to know you are a purist though.
4542 2018-01-10 17:05:33 Canadian provinces KEEP their own OIL, fishing, agriculture, IDENTITY.
4543 2018-01-10 17:05:29 Well admitted Smiffy it IS scotland`s oil,but WM has had 92% of it for 40 years and still managed to turn oil rich UK into a bankrupt debt mess.Scots had more oil than Dubai,,have you seen pics of Dubai Smiffy?
4544 2018-01-10 17:05:24 Girls be crying over guys who don’t even know how to change their engine oil
4545 2018-01-10 17:05:15 LORD, and earth is but the land of oil.
4546 2018-01-10 17:05:13 when i get home im gonna do an oil pastel drawing of mel
4547 2018-01-10 17:05:08 This is pure fixing of elections. If Iran problems goes longer, oil price will kill India and this government.this government doesn't have time to see beyond religious issues. God help my country

4551 2018-01-10 17:04:40 That being said, CA is notorious for this kind of hypocrisy. We pass climate legislation & action plans, but trying to densify neighborhoods or build more public transit is a nightmare caused by the very same residents who say big oil is bad bc of climate change.
4552 2018-01-10 17:04:33 Why not investigate the rising disparities in income inequality and study on how to correct that, or investigate the oil spills that have happened after deregulation and how they abuse their workers and kill our environment?  Or Big pharma distributors/wholesalers ?
4553 2018-01-10 17:04:32 Can I just get an oil change without basically being told my car isn't a piece of shit
4554 2018-01-10 17:04:27 Let's drill holes all over Trumps properties and see what he thinks about oil prospecting then.
4555 2018-01-10 17:04:13 What do you, the US government & crude oil have in common?
4556 2018-01-10 17:04:03 Otherwise explain the U.S. close ties with Saudi besides the oil...
4557 2018-01-10 17:03:59 Tires rotated, oil changed, hopefully I don’t die on my drive
4558 2018-01-10 17:03:44 No S—-! Moron—I was tweeting this since bannon got involved! The moron wants a war in Asia ! Whether it be Korea’s, China, Japan! About OIL AND TRADE-also debt Chinese have bought on us!

4562 2018-01-10 17:03:34 Background: Comes from Edo period hair oil salesmen who took their time chitchatting with the customers when selling.
4563 2018-01-10 17:03:22 I’ve never once in my life seen anyone I know die from the flu.  Keep selling that big pharma snake oil Doc.
4564 2018-01-10 17:03:13 BLM and BigOil no doubt. The requirements of cattle ranchers and oil & gas production blind any truth in America.
4565 2018-01-10 17:02:54 When you have a sew in, apply oil into your scalp at least twice a month. You don’t have to overdo it, but you have to maintain your natural hair even with protective styles
4566 2018-01-10 17:02:40 We've been sold this snake oil before.
4567 2018-01-10 17:02:28 @AdamMancini4 oil short or buy?plswhat?
4568 2018-01-10 17:02:26 US Navy should blockade NK ports to enforce UN resolution stopping oil transfers.
4569 2018-01-10 17:02:25 The oil change might run $80-$100 cause your joint prolly take synthetic. But the tail light shouldn’t be no more than $10. And tire pressure should be free... so yea he taxin
4570 2018-01-10 17:02:20 It looks like you have no understanding of plate tectonics. Sure, let's put an oil rig and pipeline along the Gorda plate. It's not San Andreas that's the problem. #LookItUp
4571 2018-01-10 17:02:20 Have a look at the profits of a corp like Shell. World wide. 
They are considerably LESS than the £18 billion spent on climate change just in the UK. It's not a conspiracy - just saying that much money has a warping effect.
This conspiracy theory about oil companies is nonsense.

4574 2018-01-10 17:02:13 We’re talking about nationalizing the insurence industry it would be comparable to nationalize oil and gas and turn them into a climate clean up/repair industry (with a small national plastic industry on the side)

4580 2018-01-10 17:01:56 Do you think oil field people are stupid? I agreed with you that the energy sector needed to do some fat trimming, can you agree with me that there is a desperate need to trim some people in the education sector?
4581 2018-01-10 17:01:39 My man swapped cars with me so he can take my car to get a oil change and tires rotated. These little things are why he the mvp.

4587 2018-01-10 17:01:15 Here are some tips to lighten-up your intake of fats to save calories:
Focus on cooking foods via no-fat methods: bake, grill, broil, boil or poach;
When baking replace all or part of the butter or oil called for in a recipe with pureed fruits such as applesauce or baby prunes.

Its 110% safe. No chance of polluting beaches!!  Thats all Liberal objectionism. Never happened!!
Also, there are reports of a coal vein right under Mar A Largo. Start strip mining too!! We need the jobs!!

4599 2018-01-10 17:00:16 Used cooking oil is a fantastic source of revenue if you have the tools to collect it properly

4601 2018-01-10 17:00:02 @DrMichaelMosley Just read your article on coconut oil. Was "unrefined" coconut oil used in that study? Any reason to believe "refined" coconut oil would be any different? Unrefined coconut oil would overwhelm cooked foods in taste and smell.

4609 2018-01-10 16:59:18 Russia investors and banks are the only people that would loan him money. And if he lifted sanctions on Russia opening up the oil fields, he wouldn’t have to pay them back. That’s where this only deal started.
4610 2018-01-10 16:59:17 Why do you people just soak up the lies and misrepresentation of the SNP without ever thinking for yourselves??  Maybe UK govts made a wrong decision when oil came on stream, we will never know.
4611 2018-01-10 16:59:16 Remove the rest of coast States too. Frankly, we don’t need the oil.
4612 2018-01-10 16:59:12 The tax scam pushed Issa to the brink.  The prospect of oil rigs visible from Oceanside, CA pushed him over.

4622 2018-01-10 16:58:26 This whole thing is even funnier when you realize that more drilling and mining isn't going to save oil and coal.

Renewables are cheaper, the industry is growing, and the world has moved on.

For a @POTUS that was supposed to buck the mainstream... He's pretty mainstream.

4629 2018-01-10 16:57:45 Interesting, I see what you mean. Nor would anything oil based - life would be a bit shabby for sure. I still think the work to make sure “modern” chemicals are used safely needs recognising more than it is by some
4630 2018-01-10 16:57:40 Yeah he was crying his eyes out. If you can call leaking oil due to bullet holes around his eyes crying, he was also sad so it’s 100% crying

4646 2018-01-10 16:56:12 European shares end the session mixed.  Yields mostly higher. Gold up but off highs. Crude oil higher.  JPY strongest. CAD is the weakest.
The European stock markets are closed and provisional closes are showing a mixed picture for the major indices:
4647 2018-01-10 16:56:11 And we are exporting record amounts of oil and refined products. Republicans are throwing away our future just to enrich oil companies. Not to mention the big fat tax cuts they just got.
4648 2018-01-10 16:56:10 Join Canada as aprovince, KEEP oil, fishing etc , get to DECIDE Scotland's future
4649 2018-01-10 16:56:02 Sure the his well briefed, so what? He meanders all the time, does not make sense more often than not when declaring positions and, oh yeah, changing the right to oil exploration only off of Florida says what about our President?
4650 2018-01-10 16:55:59 For Canada to build pipelines and expand tar sands with solar+storage under 3 cents a kwh, is economic insanity. At those prices, and the electrification of transport, oil demand will shrink rapidly.
4651 2018-01-10 16:55:57 My favorite marinade for chicken is thyme, olive oil, rosemary, lemon, a dash of salt and pepper
4652 2018-01-10 16:55:46 The only reason was to prevent oil drilling in the vicinity of Mar-A-Lago. Trump doesn't care unless it protects his property
4653 2018-01-10 16:55:38 Coconut oil lipgloss is bomb 
4654 2018-01-10 16:55:37 Oil terminals in Boston were closing last week per my oil guy. Nothing on local news. I filled my tank with 60 gallons of diesel from gas station.
4655 2018-01-10 16:55:36 It’s crazy that some people have to deal with oily skin and I’m over here pouring oil all over my face every day to combat this incessant dry skin.
4656 2018-01-10 16:55:36 @jemelehill, I know @willcain didn't call LaVar Ball a snake oil salesman after admonishing @maxkellerman for calling Tom Brady's trainer, a guy who claimed to sell a product that cured cancer, the same thing. I didn't just watch that, right?
4657 2018-01-10 16:55:27 ทำหายไปละประเด็น
4658 2018-01-10 16:55:20 Sad that these morons think an oil rich scotland needs England to get by,,when in fact the oppossite is the case!,The media have a lot to answer for,there are people in England who actually think Davidson won in scotland ffs
4659 2018-01-10 16:55:19 Me no likey Lorenzo's Oil. Banjir tangis.
4660 2018-01-10 16:55:08 Andrew Blackwell: "Let us keep our stereotype that Canadians are mild-mannered, but in terms of oil there is nothing moderate about them."
4661 2018-01-10 16:55:03 Is this before or after you OK oil or fracking drilling there?
4662 2018-01-10 16:55:02 Hmmmmmm you are the sneaky snake oil salesman. #LiarInChief
4663 2018-01-10 16:55:02 Grapefruit oil (one of main ingredients) is known for appetite suppressant :) I believe the other oils are mixed as well to benefit! Omg my hardest part is waking up, im only a morning person if i can awaken hahah
4664 2018-01-10 16:54:54 Oh, nice oil rig reference.
4665 2018-01-10 16:54:53 พี่กี้เห็นอะไรอ่ะ //รีบมากระซิบข้างหูน้องนะ
4666 2018-01-10 16:54:44 That volcanic eruption that hot oil does just happened now so I’m in a long distance relationship with the frying pan, can’t come and die
4667 2018-01-10 16:54:38 2018 is the year we NEED people to wake up. Stop watching the news and CNN. Quit playing attention to that dipshit cartoon we call a president. Start researching pharmaceutical companies and oil companies and see how disgusting it is. #truth #wakeup
4668 2018-01-10 16:54:36 That’s pretty damn good. try hard dry  cheese such as Parmesan drizzled with honey.  Some people add a drop of truffle oil but cheese is already damn expensive.
4669 2018-01-10 16:54:36 Tell@me why FFP investigated our spending twice last year and found out we were spending what we earn? Funny that. But yeh it’s all oil money isn’t.
4670 2018-01-10 16:54:31 Congrats to Lisa Johnston Brewer on winning the cup and Cindy Maxwell for winning the Dill oil!!
4671 2018-01-10 16:54:15 I use to add it to my pasta dish to ingest the oil. I also use it as a fungicide. :-)
4672 2018-01-10 16:54:05 Apparently, the Utah wage gap of paying women only .69 cents, to every white male's dollar, is economically advantageous to businesses.  Stealing public lands and selling them off to Big Oil, is popular with the Koch brothers. Allowing unchecked pollution is cool, too. #VoteBlue
4673 2018-01-10 16:54:03 We dont want to drill on our soil, bo drills on shores, don’t want to be dependent on middleeast for oil yet we drive big 
4674 2018-01-10 16:53:55 Haha erm gtu ah. Dok keje lagi tu gong doh. Nk kabo paka sek oil & gas saje ah tu. Bakpe eh jadi riak takbur gini
4675 2018-01-10 16:53:46 My trick is to use a little body oil mixed in with my lotions. A drop or two with the lotion. It takes longer to apply, but it works well.
4676 2018-01-10 16:53:46 Shocked and happy that Rick Scott actually said no to offshore drilling.  Family and fun and sun... an oil spill fiasco is not worth the risk to that. Good economic decision! #Florida #Beach 
4677 2018-01-10 16:53:41 Any tips on how to get Kitchen oil out your clothes??
4678 2018-01-10 16:53:31 Congratulations Ababu Namwamba on being appointed the minister for  devolution at the Jesus Is Alive Ministries. This means you will be in-charge of special programs(Kesha), Finance (Sadaka, Tenths & Tithes) and Water (Holy Water and boycotted Bidco anointing oil) in Brussels
4679 2018-01-10 16:53:27 The overriding concern is not only to prevent buyer confusion as to the source of the goods, but to protect the registrant from adverse commercial impact due to use of a similar mark by a newcomer.  See In re Shell Oil Co., 992 F.2d 1204, 1208
4680 2018-01-10 16:53:26 I dont. oil pulling is more effective, and Ive been doing that for around 2 years now
4681 2018-01-10 16:53:13 I didn’t make it to get my oil changed. I’m so annoyed. I started clean and lost track of time. 
4682 2018-01-10 16:53:07 Oil, oil, oil.    It didn't work in Iraq and it won't work in Iran.
4683 2018-01-10 16:52:58 หางานให้กูแล้วไงงงงงง หึหึหึ
4684 2018-01-10 16:52:57 Took the plunge cause I was broke and used a moisturizer with fucking coconut oil in it... Worst mistake I've ever made. Stopped using it and these awful breakouts on my cheeks started clearing up immediately.
4685 2018-01-10 16:52:55 I do not think the CNY oil contract will be paid in gold.  I do think a CNY gold settlement system is already in place, w/ a gold window having been re-opened in Shanghai in 3q14.  I do not think goal is to destroy the USD.  I do think the outcome will be a big USD deval v gold
4686 2018-01-10 16:52:49 The water and sewer companies will get some relief from masses Not rushing to the bathroom at halftime.
4687 2018-01-10 16:52:47 Ah one lets out water the engine releases the oil... 
4688 2018-01-10 16:52:45 Govt policies geared toward dem states and businesses.   Now it will be geared towards repub states and activities (oil, farm, auto, coal, no climate change myths, military, etc...) so that will have an impact in different places
4689 2018-01-10 16:52:42 $TMST higher as oil price surpassed three-year highs today. Anticipate a good year for Timkensteel, but needs to invest profit into non-oil technology if it is to prosper in the next 100 years.
4690 2018-01-10 16:52:40 College Educated people favored Clinton by a pretty big margin yet democrats rely on low info voters ? Hilarious - trump even said “he loved the uneducated” because their so easy to sell his Charlatan snake oil “politics” to
4691 2018-01-10 16:52:40 2017~ US had 16 major natural disasters costing US $306B+ while there were 3 major hurricanes costing $100B ea. Worldwide according National & Oceanic Administration due to Climate Change yet GOP still denies it's existence.Turn off Oil/Gas/Coal. DEMAND SOLAR/WIND USE OR FIRE GOP
4692 2018-01-10 16:52:39 Closing prices: #Ftse100 0.23% #DAX -0.78% #CAC -0.35% #Estoxx50 -0.42% #GBPUSD 1.3509 #EURGBP 0.8855 #GILTBUND 0.0 #Gold 0.33% #Oil 0.83%
4693 2018-01-10 16:52:34 Yes, but SoCal roads are designed poorly for water runoff and the traffic +  lack of consistent rain causes extreme oil buildup. I’m the first to complain about bad drivers but it actually is much worse here than most areas when it rains.
4694 2018-01-10 16:52:30 Common person ko chhaiye woh apna ghar aur business meh ground nut oil used kare.
4695 2018-01-10 16:52:26 Oil, oil, oil.    It didn't work in Iraq and it won't work in Iran.
4696 2018-01-10 16:52:14 onsenって名前の仮想通貨作ったら「PCでonsen掘り放題」じゃん。
むしろOILって名前にして持っておいて、めっちゃ金持ちになったら石油王名乗れて二度美味しいのでは、、、

4697 2018-01-10 16:52:13 Found out the $177 I spent on an essential oil starter kit are toxic to my cats so that’s money down the drain. @younglivingUS is only offering partial store credit minus shipping cost. Like I want to buy other, different but still toxic to cats products...
4698 2018-01-10 16:52:03 Now that it's public, he will be taken out by an assassin that works for big oil.

4700 2018-01-10 16:51:48 You should try a face oil!
4701 2018-01-10 16:51:36 Avocados, nuts/seeds, nut butters, olives, olive oil/olive oil based salad dressings, whole milk, some fish (gross) etc.. It's higher calorie stuff so just gotta monitor amounts if you're trying to lose weight
4702 2018-01-10 16:51:30 Oil, olil, oil.    It didn't work in Iraq and it won't work in Iran.
4703 2018-01-10 16:51:28 Check his schedule for visits from oil lobbyists
4704 2018-01-10 16:51:26 Not only is his disgusting administration allowing oil companies to set up shop off pretty much entire US coastline except where his property is...they're also undermining/removing the safeguards and regulations put in place to stop things like BP oil spill from happening again.
4705 2018-01-10 16:51:22 Trump administration won't allow oil drilling off of Florida to protect family assets while crapping on the rest of the country. 

There. I fixed it for you.
4706 2018-01-10 16:51:17 2/2-oil is NRG reliant keeps us self sufficient supplyprices screw OPEC =win USA more jobs esp.locally in towns which would dbl local $$$ . B very careful who u call stupid b cuz we disagree on policy #MAGA #AmericaFirst
4707 2018-01-10 16:51:08 I knew Feinstein when she was the Mayor of SF and she did a lot good for that city. Yet as Senator she is now beholden to big oil (Chevron) and big med (Blue Cross)! Corporations that just received a HUGE tax break! She is worth $52.8 million. Sorry my vote cant be bought!
4708 2018-01-10 16:51:04 Our coastline is very fragile and valuable to the wildlife that is indigenous to Virginia. We need wind turbines not oil spills. Dominion power has consistently pushed back against wind energy.  Oil is a filthy disaster. #Environmental #NoDrilling
4709 2018-01-10 16:50:52 Worth it to save our NHS alone but when you throw in saving our place in EU, no tuition fees, free social care, oil revenues, whisky revenues, to name but some then I just cannot understand why the mad yoons would want to stay on the sinking rule britannia, dragging us with them.
4710 2018-01-10 16:50:48 Oil, oil, oil.   It didn't work in Iraq and it won't work in Iran.
4711 2018-01-10 16:50:41 Pols won’t allow any pipelines to be built, it’s crazy that NE still predominantly burning fuel oil to heat homes when cheap abundant natural gas is produced a few 100 miles away in PA.
4712 2018-01-10 16:50:40 Are we getting oil rigs off of our beautiful coast?
4713 2018-01-10 16:50:33 Oil will boil till the Aramco IPO.. till then there will be jitters for airline stocks. After oil stabilizes, and new airport policy kicks in, the prices will fly. This is my guess.
4714 2018-01-10 16:50:33 Thank you, but it is a variation of the humble Scotch Pie, we move with the times and adapt as we go.
4715 2018-01-10 16:50:18 I can answer that. I live in Texas. When I was younger I used to go to Galveston all the time. There are lots of offshore oil wells, not too close but close enough. The last few times I went the water was murky brown with globs of black tar floating around and all over the beach.
4716 2018-01-10 16:50:17 I use their toner, daily moisturizer, and deep earth clay face wash. I also use Sunday Riley night oil too which has been amazing.
4717 2018-01-10 16:50:14 Trump doesn't want oil rig bought in West Palm Beach. 

Michael Moore was ready.....
4718 2018-01-10 16:50:13 Then please research MAPS, "non offending pedosexuals", NAMBLA, and Heart Progress and protect the LGBT/trans community from these snake oil salesmen!
4719 2018-01-10 16:50:13 The “punish” Dem states with oil rigs off their coasts while protecting GOP run states should do wonders for them.
4720 2018-01-10 16:50:12 PM ko chhaiye ke request kare  logo  se maximum ground nut and ground nut oil purchase kare.sab army canteen meh ground nut complusary Kar deh.
4721 2018-01-10 16:50:11 BREAKING: Florida Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson is threatening to use an obscure Senate rule - which Republicans have used to dismantle many Obama-era policies - to attempt to strike down President Trump’s repeal of Obama-era safety rules for offshore oil drilling.
4722 2018-01-10 16:50:05 Exploring pure oud oil!
4723 2018-01-10 16:49:48 How is it legal for the Administration to pick & choose which states they will protect from offshore drilling. This is not gerrymandering of districts after a 10 yr census the GOP likes to do! Keep all U.S. shores safe from oil pollution not just states w/R Governors!
4724 2018-01-10 16:49:26 Essential oil diffusers are fidget spinners for middle aged people.
4725 2018-01-10 16:49:22 I promise to get an oil change this weekend. My light isn’t on, but I feel like it should be
4726 2018-01-10 16:49:21 As someone who have been addicted to both opiods and benzodiazepines I now use CBD oil to curtail my severe period pains. It doesn’t get me high and my state doesn’t alter. If people refrain from driving or operating while high I don’t understand the problem. People will still 1/
4727 2018-01-10 16:49:16 They played really well , use struggled to finish them off  my tweet states it , but i got respect for them for murking your oil club 
4728 2018-01-10 16:49:15 I hope all you “New Year , New Me” females come with New Weave too

Put some oil sheen && moose on that stale ass see-in 

Stop leaving the ends of y’all braids unraveling . Get it braided to the end && get that shit dipped Sis

4730 2018-01-10 16:48:41 Inconsistent and ever changing regulations, increased tax burden, long delays in approvals lack of pipeline capacity, If it wasn't for the excitement around the Duvernay oil play Alberta would be dead until 2019
4731 2018-01-10 16:48:31 Only reason Florida got an exception is because Trump's property is there, Mar-a-Lago. Trump doesn't care if entire country coastline covered in oil, all marine life wiped out there, tourism dries up hurting local economy. He only wants to make sure his property isn't affected.
4732 2018-01-10 16:48:30 @SecretaryZinke DJT doesn't want to see oil drilling platforms from his window at Mar-a-lago.
4733 2018-01-10 16:48:29 An avid oil diffuser user. Vanilla. It’s a vibe.
4734 2018-01-10 16:48:26 It's just so lovely to have such incredible friends! Thank you for your support!! And to all 
4735 2018-01-10 16:48:15 If you have an oil burner put a bit of Vicks vapour rub on it it helps wonders
4736 2018-01-10 16:47:48 We have been paying more, the wage increase never went up accordingly throughout the years.  Power,oil,water,food and gas continue to rise every year & products as well because of this.
4737 2018-01-10 16:47:47 Stop ruining our environment for big oil and gas.  I’m sure plenty of kickback money going round!
4738 2018-01-10 16:47:44 Oil prices higher and UST yields higher, and guess the big loser has been Turkey, with the lira back on the back foot again. Guess not helped by Erdogan banging the US again over the Atilla case et al. In the end USD is the funding currency for Turkey.
4739 2018-01-10 16:47:43 "How come you never get seasonally sick?"

I put respek on the cyclical nature of life.  Timing matters grasshopper.

-Garlic, fish oil, lemons, honey, ginger, fresh fruit, bone marrow, natural probiotics (kombucha, kefir, sauerkraut ect.)
4740 2018-01-10 16:47:40 Crude oil  less may not sustain !

4742 2018-01-10 16:47:22 Okay, Hive Mind, talk to me about your experiences with CBD oil. Got a starter bottle this morning because my St John's Wort is fantastic at treating my low grade anxiety but I am tired of dreaming my face off every night. Thoughts?
4743 2018-01-10 16:47:17 I wonder if Revlon have actually released their black seed oil shampoo, because I’ve tried a few samples and I think this may be my new shampoo
4744 2018-01-10 16:47:16 Wow Ian just fantastic 
4745 2018-01-10 16:47:11 Remember Santa Barbara, 1969. Largest oil spill in U.S. history until the Exxon Valdez.
4746 2018-01-10 16:47:05 I love all the switches ... Are they bespoke?  Does one of them release oil out the back when you are being chased ...? Please say yes
4747 2018-01-10 16:47:05 I like organic oils too. Marula oil for my face. Sweet almond oil for body & doubles as an overnight treatment for dry hair. 
4748 2018-01-10 16:46:55 Oil rally takes Brent crude closer to 3-year high...
4749 2018-01-10 16:46:55 Boy I get an oil change like twice a year. 3/3000 rule has been out the window since 2000.
4750 2018-01-10 16:46:55 We’ve tried that, I put her diffuser on every night and I’ve even done the coconut oil and lavender on her feet before bed. She hates sleep
4751 2018-01-10 16:46:51 Truly honored for the mention from the world’s leading olive oil  @great_oil
4752 2018-01-10 16:46:51 @dannykellywords so spurs are just gonna get wealthy off the back of their buddies in America eh? Bit like city with their "oil money" then ? Hypocrites.
4753 2018-01-10 16:46:38 Seriously...who the f is buying oil right here? $USO
4754 2018-01-10 16:46:23 Depends on your car foreign oil changes be expensive as hell other shit like tail light 20-30 and tire pressure free lol
4755 2018-01-10 16:46:22 So potentially you could be at a casino watching an oil spill. Or be on that big ass wheel ride thing at Wildwood looking out at an oil platform. Christie sucks
4756 2018-01-10 16:46:06 บ้าปะ ถูกเขาบอกว่า คิดได้แค่ เพื่อน ยังยิ้มหัวเราะออกมาได้ ถามว่าเจ็บมั้ย ก็เจ็บ แต่โล่งอะ แค่แกไม่เปลี่ยนไปก็พอใจแล้ว

4758 2018-01-10 16:45:59 @LeoC_OSiebert La société The inprod vous invite à sa salon Carthage Best Olive Oil en tant que speaker qui aura lieu du 24 au 26 janvier 2018. Veuillez nous envoyer votre adresse mail pour avoir plus de détails.
4759 2018-01-10 16:45:50 I feel so accomplished. I mixed a coconut milk, walnut oil, grape seed oil, hair food, banana moisturizer hair mask. My hair has been so dry lately. I can’t wait for the end result. 
4760 2018-01-10 16:45:49 I wonder how much of this "cryptocurrency" Maduro owns personally.  Seems like a scheme to sell fuutre state oil for his own pocket.
4761 2018-01-10 16:45:46 Combine 3 pints jelly / jam with 1/3 cup jambalaya. Add Olive Oil. Chill.  Serve warm.
4762 2018-01-10 16:45:39 If you have a vaporizer try one or two drops of pure lavender oil in it before bedtime and while she sleeps. No more than 2 drops though too much is unhealthy for her to breathe in
4763 2018-01-10 16:45:32 Hypocrisy at its finest - @henrymcmaster knows if drilling for oil is dangerous to his state's economy, it's dangerous for every state's economy, and it's not with the risk. No state on either coast should bear this burden, especially when it's not necessary.
4764 2018-01-10 16:45:19 I actually randomly just mashed up an avocado in a bowl with some olive oil, salt, and pepper, spread it on toast with an egg on top. It lived up to the hype for me, and I'm no avocado fan usually. No idea if that was right either, haha

4767 2018-01-10 16:45:09 Honey dilution was the bane of my life during my PhD. Extending it with High Fructose Corn Syrup is pretty much impossible to detect to a legal standard, as honey itself is so variable.
Detecting extra-virgin olive oil extended with regular olive oil, that I can do!
4768 2018-01-10 16:45:02 I use coal face as a cleanser, it leaves my face feeling fresh and absorbs all oil from my skin. For toner I use their tea tree toner. Those two products have helped me a lot.
4769 2018-01-10 16:44:56 Why is oil not allowed to be drilled of the coast of Florida but every other U.S coastal city isle is allowed? Weird! If it’s so safe why not in Florida’s back yard where Mara a lago sits....
4770 2018-01-10 16:44:54 You are doing the entire country an injustice by allowing a pass on Florida alone when other states will get the oil spills and environmental devastation - just the Gulf recently or California has had. Please resign.
4771 2018-01-10 16:44:44 Times are proving that the move from fossil fuel is quickly becoming a reality with electric cars , solar energy ,wind power etc why is it so important to drill for Liquid gold off our coasts. In 10 years  oil may be obsolete.A last minute grab by Trump to fill his pockets ?

4774 2018-01-10 16:44:33 I modified my mom's biscuit recipe. Replaced butter, buttermilk and vegetable oil with coconut milk and coconut oil, AND A NIGGA BEEN BUSS'N DOWN BISCUITS EVER SINCE!
4775 2018-01-10 16:44:33 Yesterday my hairstylist applied beard oil. Look out, ladies: my beard is now 100% more flammable.
4776 2018-01-10 16:44:32 There you go.. see.. a plan indeed.. set up a Polly Guy support group with sole purpose of getting you the recognition warranted, you already have 2705 followers, great start, lol we could all mail CH4,BBC2 etc and put pressure onjob done 
4777 2018-01-10 16:44:31 Oil & gas industry drugs tests a ton.  I'm in two industry security databases, three of my customers' databases, and my company's system.  All do randoms and annual tests.
4778 2018-01-10 16:44:30 So the entire West Coast and East Coast is now fair game for oil spills but god forbid Mari-lago or whatever it's name is, gets a drop of oil. Somebody stop this asshole.
4779 2018-01-10 16:44:12 Oil slick around the inside lane of the roundabout at the bottom of the n6
4780 2018-01-10 16:44:11 I did the same thing in the cellar with casks. And I have a line of animal product processing machines (mayo machine, cheese press, loom, oil maker) next to a chest. All I do is dump stuff in and it takes care of everything else.
4781 2018-01-10 16:43:47 *In the waiting room of my oil change place, they still have their tree up*

Woman I don't know: I always take an ornament, one or two from each state from trees that places I go have up and write where I got them and put them on my tree at home
4782 2018-01-10 16:43:38 There shouldn't be any drilling anywhere. We don't need the oil at the risk to the environment. Renewable energy is the future.
4783 2018-01-10 16:43:32 Don't need the oil.......Another Trump bullshit move.

4787 2018-01-10 16:43:25 Central govt. fails to lower the petroleum prices by giving freedom to oil companies.
4788 2018-01-10 16:43:17 the REAL reason that Trump agreed to no OIL Drilling in Florida is a selfish reason.  His Mar-A-Lago is right on the Atlantic coast and God forbid his property would be devalued.  He has only his interest in Mind, he does not care about anything else.
4789 2018-01-10 16:43:09 ไม่ลดค่ะ งั้นคงดูผิด บิลก็ไม่ได้สน  พลาดเลยแต่ก็คุ้ม
4790 2018-01-10 16:43:08 You said 'unable'... not for lack of trying. Even the lady with the oil had to go ahead and pour it into the containers.
4791 2018-01-10 16:43:07 @usbank Follow through on your promise to suspend financing of oil & gas pipelines by suspending all financing activities with ETP & its affiliated companies
4792 2018-01-10 16:42:53 The oil drilling rigs lining the Alabama coast scar the landscape a pose a direct threat to the environment.
4793 2018-01-10 16:42:43 Brent crude oil hits new highs today ...will happily sell @ $70 per bbl at this rate , caeteris paribus price is going there
4794 2018-01-10 16:42:38 It will nice to have a representative who moves towards the next booming industry. Oil is as old and tired as the GOP party, and we are ready for the future.
4795 2018-01-10 16:42:36 Yooo I swear by makeup breakup cleansing oil. I haven't tried anything else but I'm sure they have great oil cleansers that aren't just for taking makeup off!
4796 2018-01-10 16:42:35 Trump/Zinke reversed new open oil drilling plan only for Florida because Republican gov demanded it.  So which red states are next to get pref and which blue states still get more oil rigs on the horizon? #MAGA policy in a nutshell.
4797 2018-01-10 16:42:34 Let me be your oil. It's just a little rust. Your destiny will soil if you don't learn to trust.

4801 2018-01-10 16:42:20 @ThunderRooster @carle once NG hits $2.50 oil will likely be ready to fall again.
4802 2018-01-10 16:42:17 And more oil spills! WHOOHOO! Speak for yourself, douchbag. #OilRigsForFlorida
4803 2018-01-10 16:42:11 I'm pretty sure there is no oil off the NH coast.

4814 2018-01-10 16:41:07 @ThunderRooster @carle don’t fight the trend that oil and gas companies are greedy and there is much more supply then demand
4815 2018-01-10 16:41:07 There should be fishing fleet blockades of oil ships. Look at the footage of that ship burning in Shanghai harbor.
4816 2018-01-10 16:40:52 OIL DIFF: 5.87 -> 5.97

4818 2018-01-10 16:40:43 I surprised Linsey couldn't get this done but perhaps be believes our war machine needs oil. It will be interesting what side he comes out on this. Could Linsey afford to lose votes along the coast.

4823 2018-01-10 16:40:29 I don't know about you but I can barely tolerate the thought of an oil spill off the coast of Florida potentially sullying Trump's new helipad American taxpayers just bought him
4824 2018-01-10 16:40:27 Yea, until oil spills all over.  It’ll happen eventually. #OilRigsForFlorida!
4825 2018-01-10 16:40:22 A nice line of oil drilling platforms off Myrtle Beach, Charleston Harbor and Hilton Head should be just what Trump voters in South Carolina want.
4826 2018-01-10 16:40:22 @SenNanOrrock: GA lawmakers must “be at the table” in the national conversation about coastal drilling. “GA is the only state not to weigh in” on the Trump administration’s opening of our nation’s coastlines to oil drilling. @100MilesGA #ProtectOurCoast

4831 2018-01-10 16:39:57 I feel the same... waiting for bear capitulation as a signal.. maybe seasoned oil trades become perma pessimists?
4832 2018-01-10 16:39:56 So i will see my utility rates go down? my food bills go down? gas and oil prices go down? car prices go down? clothing prices go down? everything will be cheaper? and I will see a big fat pay raise too. Is that right?

4837 2018-01-10 16:39:36 When that first oil spill happens in California that YOU VOTED FOR, there will be no place you can hide. We will make you clean it up with your tongue.
4838 2018-01-10 16:39:32 So when OUR local voices speak up, will you remove OUR states from oil drilling? B/c you KNOW Oregon won’t allow that! #OilRigsForFlorida!
4839 2018-01-10 16:39:30 @charwinslow So this Calia oil works for you and you don’t have to put it on, you just sniff it? Sure it’s not a placebo?  I’ll certainly look into it. Also; I simultaneously envy and detest the fact that you’re a successful morning person, haha. Morning people ughhh!!! Lucky.

4843 2018-01-10 16:39:18 Well obviously not everyone supports Alberta oil. Like the Federal Liberals, Justin Trudeau(I’ll add him separate), the NDP Alberta, the NDP BC, Quebec (transfer payments), Climate Activists (who still drive, heat their homes)

4846 2018-01-10 16:38:53 Oil up to $63.47/barrel in North America today.  Admittedly, I have been surprised that oil prices have marched higher so quickly.  I expect them to moderate in the weeks ahead as new quantity supplied comes on line chasing these higher prices.#adjustmentforthcoming
4847 2018-01-10 16:38:44 We need to take step on contaminated oil this is big big problem for people who is using @PMOIndia @PMO_India @narendramodi @AmitShah @BJP4India @BPCLimited @rjmalishkaa @abpnewstv @Zigwheels @vwfsIndia @CarWale @abpnewstv @aajtak @PetroleumMin @IndianOilcl @CPMumbaiPolice

4850 2018-01-10 16:38:32 Tell that to all the people who have lost jobs in the oil industry. BTW How do you know that the MSM is garbage, except that you must read it? That smacks of masochism! Where do you get the correct news from? Fox, CNN, Sky, CBC, RT, Al Jazeera?
4851 2018-01-10 16:38:13 When u think of it of course scotland would be better off its not just our oil that we have. Scotland subsidises england and we wouldnt be paying for trident or the hs2 that doesnt even come up as far as Scotland. England wouldnt survive without the revenue from Scotland .!!!
4852 2018-01-10 16:38:11 Eep!

I was standing in a store yesterday thinking “I could make my own body oil from olive oil!” & I slapped myself right back to common sense.

4856 2018-01-10 16:37:48 I can’t afford to change my oil every time the weather changes. I let everything warm up instead of just running it wide open as soon as it starts
4857 2018-01-10 16:37:47 True story here in RI... lots of oil companies ran out completely, people couldn't find a company to get oil from, have friends who ran out completely

4863 2018-01-10 16:37:25 We don't want offshore oil and gas platforms off the Atlantic coast.
4864 2018-01-10 16:37:22 China is no longer buying UST and they are also starting to price oil in Yuan.  The party is over and no one seems to realize.
4865 2018-01-10 16:37:09 Tomorrow lunchbox is sorted timmy 
4866 2018-01-10 16:37:07 And the official EIA report was half of what the API reported. Falsifying data to sway the price of oil.
4867 2018-01-10 16:36:56 Radio listener:"In response to the Cuomo/deBlasio efforts to sue, hinder, and divest from the oil and gas industries, the oil and gas industries should divest from New York and stop selling their products in the state."
4868 2018-01-10 16:36:56 Why is it ok to drill for oil for America off the shores of other lands but not our own?
4869 2018-01-10 16:36:45 Don't fall for this hoax; it's a diversionary tactic to shift attention away from leaking pipelines, contaminated aquifers from fracking, and the sale of US oil to Asian markets.
4870 2018-01-10 16:36:45 Iraq to ask foreign oil firms to build housing, provide services for employees
4871 2018-01-10 16:36:42 Yeah the water would be unclear due to the pollution and oil.
4872 2018-01-10 16:36:36 Tell me why when oil companies give a day they're delivering they don't give you a timeframe ???

4874 2018-01-10 16:36:29 I at first read this as a reply to Gov. Cooper's tweet about opposing off-shore oil drilling.
4875 2018-01-10 16:36:27 $85 on a oil change... fuck these new cars and the synthetic oil they need. Bourgeois ass cars needing this expensive shit.
4876 2018-01-10 16:36:20 Madness! Haha. Hopefully he follows up with some beard wash and oil to prevent severe beard damage. 
4877 2018-01-10 16:36:10 So, one day, I saw this calabash with oil & goat head in it, with 2 pieces of yam at one junction. I didn't know when I took one piece, thank God I didn't vanish that day

4882 2018-01-10 16:35:39 Wouldn't want an oil spill hurting @realDonaldTrump's FL property values.

4888 2018-01-10 16:35:07 Well got the Neem oil. Let's hope this helps because I now look like I have chicken pox lol.
4889 2018-01-10 16:35:05 essentially because hash/cannabis oil isnt technically legal yet it cant be lab tested and the few tests theyve randomly run on random oils find many are dangerous to vape and have butane and formaldehyde and general carcinogens. so they can be just as bad as joints or cigs
4890 2018-01-10 16:35:01 #DidYouKnow? #Texas is one of the most oil-rich states in the US! On this day in 1901, the first salt dome oil discovery was made at Spindletop, near Beaumont, making 1/10/01 the most famous date in Texas petroleum history! #texas #wednesdaywisdom
4891 2018-01-10 16:34:59 Sorry if I confused you,I just noticed that. There’s already studies published that prove cannabis kills cancer cells it’s no longer a secret. I have a friend who’s mother actually took cannabis oil for her cancer which she’s cured of now. Stuff works man
4892 2018-01-10 16:34:56 There is a great deal of talk mentioning that China will start a crude oil futures contract priced in the yuan which will convert to gold. The contact will enable trading partners to pay with gold or to convert yuan into gold witj the grand scheme to devalue/destoy the US dollar.
4893 2018-01-10 16:34:54 .@POTUS If hurricanes are the excuse why are there oil rigs in the gulf??
4894 2018-01-10 16:34:50 Don't know about common man, but Narendra Modi's #AchheDin are definitely over. 

Crude oil has reached $68/barrel.

We're screwed! 
4895 2018-01-10 16:34:46 Hearing Tales about a crisis mode with heating in New England,  People having to drive for hours to get any fuel.  Living on  5 gallons of diesel a day of backed up oil deliveries  Anyone from the press paying attention to this
4896 2018-01-10 16:34:43 We don't have refining ability for more oil. Just gonna give it to China anyway
4897 2018-01-10 16:34:33 This free car wash >>>>> this free oil change.
4898 2018-01-10 16:34:33 Spinach, basil, sea salt, oregano, kalamata olives, roasted garlic, some olive oil drizzled on top. 
4899 2018-01-10 16:34:33 I always though Iran went to OPEC meetings & insisted on the highest price for oil, so it could just make money fast, invest it to build other parts of the economy & have a diversified economy by the time the oil ran out.  Its not quite that simple I guess. it never is

4905 2018-01-10 16:33:59 To any USA coast for that matter. We need to move on from our dependency in oil and carbon as fuel.
4906 2018-01-10 16:33:50 Right now I’m using a rose oil from Korress! Their ingredient list is like little to none. I also alternate between maracuja oil from Tarte and that one is honestly my favorite one ever. What are your skin concerns tho?
4907 2018-01-10 16:33:46 Wouldn’t expect anything less... o wait isn’t it true the only place no oil drilling is allowed is Florida but all other U.S coastlines are ok that weird!!!!
4908 2018-01-10 16:33:43 Read the label. You'll have your own answer.
The ingredients might vary from flavor to flavor, but generally speaking they are nothing but liquid sugar with some vegetable oil and maybe some soy protein.

4911 2018-01-10 16:33:28 Yet @jjhorgan & @JustinTrudeau  are planning for increased tanker traffic - carrying LNG, oil, etc. This is NOT in the best interests of people, only corporations. We need real leaders #bcpoli #cdnpoli

4914 2018-01-10 16:32:55 When you go to get a oil change and they start bringing up everything else thats wrong with your car like damn okay ? mind your business 
4915 2018-01-10 16:32:50 Two suggestions - Kefir from @ChucklingGoat & golden paste (Google will explain, but the paste is turmeric, coconut oil, water & black pepper). Good luck!
4916 2018-01-10 16:32:40 This is ridiculous of you to construct on this FB Poll, perhaps these voters are from Suli.  Let's ask you @KamalChomani who do you think should have control of Kirkuk oil?
4917 2018-01-10 16:32:39 Petrol diesel prices are increasing daily irrespective of crude oil prices. Till now I haven't saw any decrease in petrol prices. So irritated that this govt is not doing anything to stop this robbery. And they are encouraging this way of pricing too #PetrolPrice
4918 2018-01-10 16:32:39 We have enough issues in NJ, we don't need an off shore oil spill
4919 2018-01-10 16:32:14 Well done seeing likes such as Guyana an Jamaica entering the oil/gas sector .
More has to be done having more food production locally,we have to work on bringing back the smelter, seeing we can gain huge foreign exchange via the motor vihecle manufactoring  industries

4922 2018-01-10 16:31:31 Exchange rate was N150 - 199. Do the maths again. Lol. What do you think the dollars in FX reserve is used for? The cheaper the N is to the $, the more $ you use to "defend" the N. Fuel is imported using N? Plus FG paid FX differentials to oil marketers as part of subsidy.
4923 2018-01-10 16:31:30 It will never happen' you are an oil producing nation who they managed to convince they could not go it alone. Whisky sales are all bought for the next 5 years and the 3rd highest UK export. Yet you believed what the media told you without thinking for yourselves.

4936 2018-01-10 16:30:24 It’s not about politics. It’s about right versus wrong. It is definitely wrong to put our coastal waters in danger, republicans removed the tax on oil that goes into a cleanup fund with their tax bill. If it happens, no money for cleanup.
4937 2018-01-10 16:30:19 And that's why there was just an oil spill in our new pipeline that DT approved? All of this updated new technology to protect us from spills. IT JUST HAPPENED. Every pipeline has a spill. Every one. With deregs now, it will be worse. Very bad for all.
4938 2018-01-10 16:30:18 Oil inventories show a larger drawdown than expected.. Oil a little higher..
4939 2018-01-10 16:30:02 Azerbaijan accounted for 85% of oil imports to Ukraine last year, followed by Iran -- 8.5%; and Kazakhstan – 4%. (Ukraine Business Journal <am=theubj.com@mail145.atl21.rsgsv.net>)

4943 2018-01-10 16:29:21 you aren’t making sense. you are telling lies about the good of oil and gas and what most real alaskans really want. you aren’t hearing nor representing us. you are cooperating, venally,  w/gravely dangerous “president.” we are planning to vote you out.
4944 2018-01-10 16:29:13 Wait, I didn’t know it damages! It’s the only primer that ever helped with my oil all day.
4945 2018-01-10 16:29:01 Moaning is also a bad habit. They give you the oil and joint access to the border and airports, you give them revenue share somewhere between 13-17% of non-sov spending. The deal is on the table - stop starving them for fun and sign the damned deal.
4946 2018-01-10 16:28:59 yall know i don’t really fuck with white people like that but i’m down for a smear of this olive oil mayo that just hopped on muni
4947 2018-01-10 16:28:52 The majority of Californians oppose offshore oil and gas programs. I hope, Mr. Zinke, you also consider our "local and state voices" to stop the offshore oil and gas programs. California coasts are also "heavily reliant on tourism as an economic driver." Stop the madness!
4948 2018-01-10 16:28:49 Please don't apologies Ian!! It's just fabulous that you and others support me !! 
4949 2018-01-10 16:28:49 This was after you signed an executive order to pull back 80% of 2 national parks in Utah to open them up for oil drilling and fracking, both of which destroy our environment and revert to an obsolete form of energy. You don't get to applaud yourself for this.
4950 2018-01-10 16:28:46 Trylah essential oil
4951 2018-01-10 16:28:39 I loooove tea tree oil
4952 2018-01-10 16:28:38 The uk is not the sixth richest country . Why do people keep repeating that rubbish? You think the Uk is richer than Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait etc, all floating on oil? Give me a break...
4953 2018-01-10 16:28:30 Ask some climate litigation experts that question about the users of the oil.
4954 2018-01-10 16:28:29 Neither are ok. Oil spills do not ever go away. Oil just sinks to the bottom. And what about plastics/pollution? Any plastic in your fish lately? We need to save our oceans. It is our life. Please do your research on that. This is not an LOL problem.
4955 2018-01-10 16:28:28 Me too!!! I want the strawberry face scrub, the eye cream and the rose hip oil next 
4956 2018-01-10 16:28:27 Well the look of those oil rigs would simply clash with the Mar-A-Lago style.
Just like a wind farm would when Sen. Kennedy killed that project off the coast of Mass.
So unfortunately the oil drilling will need to be relocated off the coast of a blue state.

Sarcasm intended.
4957 2018-01-10 16:28:16 isn't this just a natural consquence of mix-shift to tight oil?
4958 2018-01-10 16:28:12 NEWS FLASH: no one wants oil drilling off their coasts! Florida gets a break because of personal interests (think Mar A Lago). Hypocrit! Dont disguise this behind : "we hear the local voices". We see you! We see Trump! We see the money in the pockets of few.
4959 2018-01-10 16:28:08 How about the lower bills reflect using dirty coal & oil while other countries pass us by. We need to lead in, AI, SOLAR, WIND AND WAVE POWER, you idiots sell to oil & mining foreign OWNED CORPORATIONS.  Murders and Traitors = Republicans HANG'EM all.
4960 2018-01-10 16:27:36 Ol'Bob sez , We should respect the wishes of the Carolina's... for the liberal states NO , but we will build Wind Farms on their beaches to block the view of the oil platforms... see a easy solution

4964 2018-01-10 16:26:52 uhh our family relies on oil to make a living, and while not necessarily NDP per se, we’re certainly supportive of the good they’re doing, and will vote for them as long as the Cons keep their fake outrage up. We want to see our province succeed, not cry about it when it is.

4971 2018-01-10 16:26:06 Mother Jones (before HC funded them) did an expose on how State hide ties to KXL contractors. State's environmental impact statement written by oil man hired by KXL. MSM not a peep. Now Mother Jones is just a prostitute.
4972 2018-01-10 16:26:04 It’s not a great look that the Arkansas oil family won’t give this guy the job title he’s earned.
4973 2018-01-10 16:26:01 Oh good I love when @CNN is on the TV in the waiting room. This is why I usually do my own oil changes.

4980 2018-01-10 16:24:52 foreign oil?
4981 2018-01-10 16:24:48 Foreign cars usually more expensive for oil change (at least $60-100) but the taillight is a reach did he changed the whole thing or you just needed a new bulb ? Like he need to explain all that cuz nah 165 seems high as hell
4982 2018-01-10 16:24:43 Slept through my appointment to get my oil changed, guys at the shop laughed at me. It's a wonderful life.
4983 2018-01-10 16:24:41 Yes because you want @potus to get oil from countries who do not share our values and who treat women as property. You don't mind what oil does to foreign countries environment and we, the best at protecting the environment, should not drill our own oil but remain dependent on...
4984 2018-01-10 16:24:37 International Oil prices have been increasing but our AB oil price has not been. We need pipelines to get it moving. Same as years past. Keystone XL and Kinder Morgan need to happen.  #RAEforecast

4986 2018-01-10 16:24:31 Ed covered both sides KXL,oil by pipeline or train,Bernie,TPP-MSNBC couldn't allow that. Some dems upset when Ed explored transporting oil. They thought he should be absolutely anti. But he gave a thorough examination. MSNBC zombies don't like exploring all angles.
4987 2018-01-10 16:24:25 I really might have to be clean shaven for this photoshoot/auditions and I'm furious about it. DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD I WORKED FOR THIS SHIT. I pretty much should have a castor and almond oil IV drip at this point
4988 2018-01-10 16:24:24 I hate getting my oil changed 
4989 2018-01-10 16:24:24 You approve of him pulling out of the Paris Climate deal? You approve of him letting people drill for oil in our national parks? You approve of Pruitt deregulating everything the EPA has put in place to protect your children? A tax bill that is literally only for the wealthy?
4990 2018-01-10 16:24:16 I think olio is the generic word for oil, not specific to Olive oil
4991 2018-01-10 16:24:13 NO offshore gas or oil ANYWHERE in the U.S.  Someone stop this madness. We are already destroying too much.  Please!
4992 2018-01-10 16:24:09 Our future oil industry will go forward with leaner, meaner economics with automation and a much reduced workforce no matter what any govt does. It was top heavy with fat and high wages that have been shed for good...
4993 2018-01-10 16:24:06 change a thing from what my @BrookeBCNNhas done starting in #June2015 when she did d "miracle of d oil" a maintained BOTH my home gas/electricity service on d whole summer of 2015 cuz Dana?

4994 2018-01-10 16:23:40 The greedy few are F’ing with the rest of us. Oil? Coal? Drill national parks and oceans? Buy more plastic garbage for our house? Build more mass killing bombs military devices? Increased profits is our God? No no no. Free our minds. FREEOURMINDS.

4997 2018-01-10 16:23:31 We have been quite fortunate not to have had any significant spills thus far. While new energy options are becoming available - oil consumption is not going to stop any time soon. The federal gov, not the prov gov regulates vessels and gear types
4998 2018-01-10 16:23:30 There are many other issues..Offshore oil drilling. First he said all USA.. now he won’t allow in Florida. Is that fair? Because he owns Mara Lago? I don’t want my beaches polluted . He also cut requirement for oil clean up fund. Like Horizon disaster used.
4999 2018-01-10 16:23:23 Paul supports me Bigly!! He is a mindless tool that acts like Iranian people matter to him while Saudis are ignored. If Iran gave us cheap oil we would condemn their protests too! Believe me!! #StupidPaul
5000 2018-01-10 16:23:16 Don’t do it ......oil changes usually 30 max a tail light bulbs is a few dollars from and parts store and you can look up your car pressure just look up “PSI” specs for your make /model

5004 2018-01-10 16:23:06 Not only is Donnie holding millions for ransom his words not mine. He is allowing drilling in the gulf that potentially can damage our oceans, our shorelines, jobs, proven scientific that oil drilling has caused all of the above. Environmental award slipping away.

5010 2018-01-10 16:22:42 @DarrellIssa you screwed California over, you should be embarrassed, you chose to be aligned with @SenateMajLdr @jasoninthehouse Russian puppets glad ur retiring.  Every new oil platform off our coast will remind us how you screwed us

Global equity rally cools but energy stocks rise as oil prices hit fresh highs
5012 2018-01-10 16:22:38 Where should we drill for oil, then? Or just depend on foreign oil? Who is ready to give up their heating, cars, etc?  I would like a better way too but what's your solution?
5013 2018-01-10 16:22:31 Dude, I’m just here for an oil change. I don’t want a new car. Leave me alone.
5014 2018-01-10 16:22:27 You bet it is! That and the prospect of oil rigs off our coast
5015 2018-01-10 16:22:25 One grifter advising another. Snake oil salespeople of the highest order, Hucksters who have identified a huge market of gullible suckers who they can fleece
5016 2018-01-10 16:22:21 I’m at the car dealership waiting to get an oil change (wait is around 2-3 hours so I’ve decided to start people watching) stay tuned
5017 2018-01-10 16:22:20 You realise  we are in 2018 and have to deal with reality now? How does harking back decades do us any good? Btw it’s Uk oil and we all benefited from it
5018 2018-01-10 16:22:10 Not to mention what an oil spill does ecologically to an area that produces significant amount of country’s food.
5019 2018-01-10 16:21:48 The problem in one! I get so angry when established scientific facts are “balanced” by the snake oil merchants. How long before the BBC will interview a flat earther for “balance”?
5020 2018-01-10 16:21:41 Clay Cooley Mitsubishi Arlington, TX and they actually broke a gasket changing the oil and still have my car. Over 24 hours nor for a simple service.
5021 2018-01-10 16:21:40 Senator:  Be Happy Florida is off the list because Florida voted Trump.  Blue States will have off shore drilling.  We need the oil to be energy independent.  Jobs, Jobs, Jobs.  JM
5022 2018-01-10 16:21:30 Beard balm, beard baubles, beard dye, beard oil, the only things that go into my beard are crumbs and spit
5023 2018-01-10 16:21:24 my face oil from palmer’s has rosehip oil in it and i really like it. i noticed my spots fading and it absorbs pretty fast.
5024 2018-01-10 16:21:22 If there were oil/gas deposits along the continental shelf, there would also be deposits on the adjacent land.  There isn't any along the Atlantic coast.  Any 1st year geology student knows this.  The entire topic is political.
5025 2018-01-10 16:21:18 European countries should know if they want 2 side with the regime, the people of Iran would make it impossible for European businesses to do business with Iran. Just like the oil tank that is burning. If the money is not going 2 people the business will not be supported in Iran
5026 2018-01-10 16:21:15 Lavender or tea tree oil and certain supplements such as Dong Quai and Tribulus terrestris have also been associated with #gynecomastia.
5027 2018-01-10 16:21:12 You seem to think Rachel Notley’s NDP should be miracle workers and raise the prices of oil back to $100/bbl. Kenney’s plans would make it much worse! Our oil industry has changed and will NEVER return to what it was.
5028 2018-01-10 16:21:11 So if FL is exempt bcuz they rely on the coasts for tourism $, then to a greater extent so does CA. And NC & SC.  WA and OR, LA, MS, AL, VA all the way up to ME, rely on the coasts for fishing industry $. 
Which brings us all back to DO NOT EXPAND oil drilling off our coastlines.
5029 2018-01-10 16:21:10 Had to run to the car and get some beard oil to put on really quick. I was looking a bit dry out here

5035 2018-01-10 16:20:25 It sounds to me like you’re not standing with the conservatives on this. I appreciate that Ms. Sarandon. These oil pipelines are definitely a danger...to people, and to the earth. Something worth standing up and shouting about.

5037 2018-01-10 16:20:21 Scotland vastly greater resources / head than r-UK - water, oil, land
W/out lead weight of inept (mainly Tory) Westminster Govts. who consistently mismanaged oil & tailored UK economy for service / financial (i.e. London) sectors we can only prosper
Biggest risk is staying in UK
5038 2018-01-10 16:20:10 Yeah and Castor oil or sometimes Jamaican Castor oil
5039 2018-01-10 16:20:08 Wow! Which specific location took 8 hours to get your oil changed?? I'll make sure this gets addressed immediately! Thanks
5040 2018-01-10 16:19:56 Jodie Willsher administration bars drilling for oil and gas off Florida after governor's plea Follo…
5041 2018-01-10 16:19:39 This oil change place is full of tatted up men and I'm a fan.
5042 2018-01-10 16:19:35 The only reason natural gas has been pushed as a petroleum alternative, or a bridge, is because oil companies already had the means to extract it, whereas they'll be left out of the renewable energy market after putting all of their eggs in hydrocarbons.

5049 2018-01-10 16:18:52 you think its not going to retest?
5050 2018-01-10 16:18:49 I wished they would open up oil drilling right up in Zinke and Rick Scott’s buttholes.
5051 2018-01-10 16:18:37 When do they begin drilling for oil there?
5052 2018-01-10 16:18:34 Caucasus, from Majorca is given in doses of 16,000 quick-sets in oil or African side he even to have completed the Himalayas,
5053 2018-01-10 16:18:11 $150m of Chinese money is cheap if you think of the squandered oil wealth... knowing the good temperament of the good burghers of Juba, I am sure the urine smell, shouting and chaos will quickly return..

Oil Price?
5061 2018-01-10 16:17:45 Every oil drill platform needs spill containment capabilities, if were gonna explore the off coast fields. I have ZERO opposition if that happens, but I dont think the technology or infrastructures there, yet. Just 'drill baby drill' is immoral, & catering 2 Chumps base vs USA #1
5062 2018-01-10 16:17:43 YOU ARE DESTROYING THE ENVIRONMENT - YOU ARE TRYING TO STOP FARMERS FROM GROWING MARIJUANA - YOU ARE POLLUTING OUR AIR AND WATER WITH YOUR FOSSIL FUEL INITIATIVES - YOU HAD OIL LEAK OUT OF BAD PIPELINE - DENYING GLOBAL WARMING - BUT YES YOU ARE A FRIEND TO THE FARMERS!!!

5067 2018-01-10 16:17:24 I made some whipped shea butter with lemongrass and peppermint oil last night I feel like Erykah Badu.
5068 2018-01-10 16:17:24 cbd oil should be available at any medical dispensary around you. As far as brand's not really brands except for people like willy nelson and tommy chong that have their own companies . it's more about Strain's of the weed itself indica/sativa the 2 main types of weed
5069 2018-01-10 16:17:16 That’s good,I’ll say thanks to Rick Scott for that,but every one needs to speak up against this so that no state or area has to endure the horrors of an oil spill or accident-our waters and what lives in them deserve better.

5071 2018-01-10 16:17:10 What will affect our 2018 market? Mortgage rates/Bank of Canada rate, oil prices, consumer confidence, and employment, as well as in-migration to the Edmonton area. The usual suspects. #RAEforecast
5072 2018-01-10 16:17:01 Inbox: "Chris Christie's office issued a statement today reaffirming his opposition to gas and oil drilling off the New Jersey coast, and he urged the Department of Interior to provide New Jersey with the same exemption granted to Florida."

5074 2018-01-10 16:16:58 WTI crude oil futures are up by 10% over the last month & by more than 20% YoY topping mid 2015 levels. Oil price shock on the way so keep an eye on inflation numbers this week.
5075 2018-01-10 16:16:57 Imagine some of the crude oil in inventories actually is ultra light condensate that refiners cannot use? Inventories would look even tighter for crude
5076 2018-01-10 16:16:53 Third cold-cough in as many months. Perfect. I now permanently smell of eucalyptus oil. It’s from Kangaroo Island though ... only the best.
5077 2018-01-10 16:16:52 North Sea oil production is very expensive and the reserves are dwindling. Makes sense to keep volume down with the current global price.

5087 2018-01-10 16:16:06 How is drilling for oil off our coast not a #StatesRights issue? Why would the Feds get to say what happens on our shores? @JerryBrownGov ?

5089 2018-01-10 16:15:51 It is IRRESPONSIBLE 2 have an edict 2 open drilling off every coastal state, if there isnt FOOL-PROOF tech 2 prevent or contain oil spills immediately.

Ill leave that as 1 of my shortest tweets ever-U simply need 2 reread it til Ur brain understands what Ur eyes R reading!
5090 2018-01-10 16:15:50 This is great, but what about the rest of the eastern seaboard and the west coast?  If an oil rig leaks off the coast of Georgia, you can bet that northern Florida will be affected.  Oil leaks know no boundaries.  Fight for #NoOilDrilling anywhere.

5095 2018-01-10 16:15:27 What to use in Lieu of Pesticides? Neem Oil, Garlic & Clove Oil, Azatrol, StrawFlower Extract... the list goes on!
5096 2018-01-10 16:15:24 Ya think?!  With fracking the cost structure dropped to $40 for a new barrel and $3.00 for new gas.  If fracking were eliminated oil would go $150 and gas to $15 virtually overnight.  The US$ and balance of payments would crater, a recession would ensue.  Yes.  Positive.
5097 2018-01-10 16:15:19 We live on a planet, in a solar system, in a nebula. We can't have all the oil in earth. This planet also wants or needs oil to maintain homeostasis. Earth is watching.

5101 2018-01-10 16:14:58 Do you work in Oil and gas?
5102 2018-01-10 16:14:46 Just use a tiny bit of coconut oil  and massage it around your face before you go to bed. It's what I do and helps against acne, blackheads and makes my skin feel soft. Then in the morning wash your face with something that doesn't have alcohol in it or an exfoliant.
5103 2018-01-10 16:14:45 Ugh, why do oil changes have to be so expensive, remember when I could get it for like $20 now it’s like minn $35 
5104 2018-01-10 16:14:30 It would be helpful if so-called scripture of all religions explicitly state these "literary conventions" wherever they may have been used if only to differentiate themselves from similar claims of snake oil salesmen.

5126 2018-01-10 16:12:38 Because Rick Scott is a Repub., Florida gets let out of drilling. Everyone else gets offshore oil. Especially you, California. Be thankful.

5129 2018-01-10 16:12:23 Cannabis oil is usually made from single-bladed "sugar leaves," which are high in THC and grow in the buds of a marijuana plant.

5131 2018-01-10 16:12:13 Hmmm I wonder if the President has any property in Florida that might give him a vested interested in keeping oil rigs from littering the views and beaches in Florida? Inquiring minds want to know

5133 2018-01-10 16:11:53 He’s also going to run for Senate and he’s not in the oil business. So like all of them it’s personal gain that drives him. He has been truly evil for Florida and he looks like Batboy.
5134 2018-01-10 16:11:49 Saudis are investing more in clean energy than fossil. They need to refill their depleted coffers but they are moving their infrastructure to be green. We ALL need to be doing that because Oil is a weapon. It must never be any countries sole source of energy. 
Clean must win out.
5135 2018-01-10 16:11:42 View of a oil rig off of Ma rA Loco would damage property values & membership.

5137 2018-01-10 16:11:30 The price of oil makes no difference to petrol price  when it's low ...it didn't change that much when it was bellow $30 a barrel from when it was near $130 a barrel !

5150 2018-01-10 16:10:44 Dude. go get a cup of herbal tea or something. Calm down. 

The NDP have approved NEW projects in oil gas and chemicals. That's the truth. You can ignore that - but that would be crazy

It is stressful to deny reality. You need to take care of your mental health, and accept it.

5156 2018-01-10 16:10:15 @realDonaldTrump Please DO NOT increase oil drilling in our oceans! I am old enough to remember globs of oil on San Diego beaches in 1969 from Santa Barbara spill. Horrible! BP Gulf of Mexico? Exon Valdez? Your base DOES NOT like this idea.

5160 2018-01-10 16:09:55 So the FL coast is exempt. I guess the 200K/yr Tsar-a-Lago club members don’t want to sunbath with a view of oil rigs or swim in oil slick. But everyone else’s coasts don’t matter. @Trump is a rotten pig!

5168 2018-01-10 16:09:05 Yeah. Because nobody benefits from energy except “big oil”. Well thought out point.
5169 2018-01-10 16:09:04 I'm going to go make some ramen noodles and hopefully theres no vanilla oil in the fucking bowl
5170 2018-01-10 16:09:03 People that have oil wells we are still giving them money to buy car.
5171 2018-01-10 16:08:53 In basic terms your using Alcohol or high grade Ethanol to “wash” off the oils and terpenes. Then you purge and decarboxylate it. Depending on method, you’ll get anything from an RSO oil to a full melt shatter. But that get into too much detail to explain. Google it, be safe!
5172 2018-01-10 16:08:50 
5173 2018-01-10 16:08:46 I've heard that coconut oil in coffee isn't terrible.
5174 2018-01-10 16:08:30 Using my tax cut money to fill up my tank, oil over $63 a barrel. #ThanksTrump #funnelmoneytoexxon
5175 2018-01-10 16:08:27 getting my oil changed and the view is on.... my god these women are a torturous to listen to
5176 2018-01-10 16:08:26 Learned something about essential oils the other day. Each oil has their own frequency. Your body has a frequency. When the oil is mixed with your frequency, healing or therapeutic magic happens! 

I’m obsessed with this!
5177 2018-01-10 16:08:24 The problem with the video is that it includes Jewish organizations which are really enemies of the Islamic State, and therefore would NEVER participate in clandestine Islamic activities or plots. Oil & water don't mix...Something stinks in Denmark as the saying goes...
5178 2018-01-10 16:08:19 Starting a Keto diet today, putting oil and whipping cream in coffee is disgusting. That's def a good start, yay!
5179 2018-01-10 16:08:17 So if FL is exempt bcuz they rely on the coasts for tourism $, then to a greater extent so does CA. And NC & SC.  WA and OR, LA, MS, AL, VA all the way up to ME, rely on the coasts for fishing industry $. 
Which brings us all back to DO NOT EXPAND oil drilling off our coastlines.
5180 2018-01-10 16:08:04 So yeah, the entire western coast line of the United States. I'm sure some folks on the east coast might have similar feelings. Maybe even folks along the gulf, it's not like they've had a major oil rig disaster that got turned into a major motion picture.
5181 2018-01-10 16:07:53 So Florida is temporarily exempted from offshore drilling? What happens to Pensacola if an Alabama rig explodes, or to Jacksonville if a Georgia rig explodes? Offshore drilling is a no in any event as oil is about to become the new coal in our use of energy, dying on the vine.
5182 2018-01-10 16:07:52 If you like that product, Ouidad has an oil cleanser that I’m also OBSESSED with and I love how it makes my scalp feel!
5183 2018-01-10 16:07:47 1.) Every costal state should require special permits for oil transportation  over that states roads from every port.
2.) Deny all transportation permits for offshore oil production coming into ports.
3.) Effectively making Florida the ONLY costal state accepting offshore oil.
5184 2018-01-10 16:07:37 CALIFORNIA #SaveOurOcean ... coastlines and the destinations that tourists love  Block 45, zinke and all oil mongering Repugnants from poisoning our waters.  We see you sneaky snakes and you will be Repealed and Replaced.  Our votes will not be bought by lies, fear & oil $s.
5185 2018-01-10 16:07:26 Today is the day I finally invest in CBD oil.
5186 2018-01-10 16:07:20 I gave an old dod some reclaim which is cannabis oil that has been vaporized and turned back to oil. Lots of cbd and activated thc. The dog ran like a pup again.
5187 2018-01-10 16:07:19 "If we all stopped worrying about fixing issues of the past then maybe we would solve the problems of tomorrow" - smart owner of an olive oil factory #MoveOn
5188 2018-01-10 16:06:55 But think of what youre saying. The NDP takes over, theres already debt, theres massive infrastructure deficits, and then oil price crashes. They had to keep spending, once our economy is back on track and the infrastructure is reasonably caught up im sure they will address debt
5189 2018-01-10 16:06:52 It's less amazing when you remember Pete Wilson, "lol Fucking welfare mooches state, go Texas!", president  Wilson 2.0 in 2016, the oil drilling order, the fact that the state is 40% Hispanic and SALT being repealed 
5190 2018-01-10 16:06:43 My $30 oil change turned into $235 to fix my brake pads lmao.... i just wanted an oil change
5191 2018-01-10 16:06:42 English is easy to learn, I am sure persian too. But trust me french is a nightmare . It’s an interesting idea, but it’s like asking people to stop using oil... not really practical
5192 2018-01-10 16:06:37 Folatil Oil Dlm Jahe Sudah Sejak Dulu Tbukti Bisa Mngatasi Problem Penyumbatan Hidung Dan Sesak Nafas
5193 2018-01-10 16:06:33 Get to have a diagnostic done on my car today and figure out why I suddenly lost 4L of oil. Hoping it’s something minor that can get fixed right away so I can sell the damn thing
5194 2018-01-10 16:06:33 Day after @nytimes article details "How a Coal Baron's Wish List Became President Trump's To-Do List," @NYCMayor & @billmckibben announce NYC beginning divestment from fossil fuels AND suing 5 oil companies for endangering NYers. Thank you, @NYCMayor. We'll help you #MakeThemPay.
5195 2018-01-10 16:06:12 No matter how much lotion/coconut oil i put on as soon as i get outside i look like a powered chicken leg from Popeyes (specifically Popeyes cause they’re golden & thats what i am under this ash)
5196 2018-01-10 16:06:12 Dear peanut butter companies: WTF is your problem? Is it your goal for me to spill peanut oil all over my damn counter? Is there some trick to stirring a new jar of peanut butter that I haven’t be informed of? Please correct this design flaw.
5197 2018-01-10 16:06:04 The latest #EIA data show US crude oil stockpiles falling again- pushing Brent crude prices that much closer to the US$70/barrel mark.  Interestingly, rising US crude production hasn't put much downward pressure on #oil prices of late.
5198 2018-01-10 16:05:58 Ugh, had a 10 death Blaze game on Braxxis. 

My team was literally all squishies, but they also refused to follow up on my engages. 

So I'd charge in, lay down Oil, hit Combustion, and die. 

And my team would be standing in Fuckoffsville nowhere near me

??????
5199 2018-01-10 16:05:46 Your hair will look dirtier at first too since it’s overcompensating with oil production as a response to shampoos.

Get some dry shampoo and also just tolerate looking gross ish for like a week or two? (I’ve always wanted one of those knit hats)
5200 2018-01-10 16:05:42 Technically it takes 2.1 gallons of oil to make one gallon of gas and 3.8 gallon of oil to make 1 gallon of distillate
5201 2018-01-10 16:05:39 Disgusting that DT will now allow oil drilling off of all the coast of USA EXCEPT Fl where he owns property!!! DT takes care of DT and says FU to the rest of country!!DT puts BIG BUSINESS ahead of USA!!
5202 2018-01-10 16:05:31 We watched people slide down a mountain of baby oil for 30 minutes on NYE, no judging allowed
5203 2018-01-10 16:05:28 I think you can because it says professionals in oil and gas as well.
5204 2018-01-10 16:05:27 Coconut oil
5205 2018-01-10 16:05:19 I would love the recipe for that dessert please!
5206 2018-01-10 16:05:16 Also, OIL IS A DYING INDUSTRY. Renewable energy is the future, so take your polluting industries elsewhere (preferably the grave)
5207 2018-01-10 16:05:04 I will get some tanning oil
5208 2018-01-10 16:05:03 I’m one of those weirdos that still changes their own oil...
5209 2018-01-10 16:05:02 うおー。いい風景ですな…
5210 2018-01-10 16:05:02 I live in SE Coastal NC & work on our beach front.  3/4 of my yearly busness relies on tourism. My business along w/ countless others up & down  the coast would b destroyed by 1 oil spill.  @GOP @realDonaldTrump NC was a red state in 2016 can u afford to loose it. #saveourcoast

5215 2018-01-10 16:04:34 If he wants to drill so badly, let him put an oil rig on the lawn at Mar-a-Lago!
5216 2018-01-10 16:04:25 Day 5 of a twist out & still getting compliments on my hair . 

I ‘d just like to thank argan oil & camille rose’s almond jai twisting butter.

5218 2018-01-10 16:04:09 It's Wax Wednesday!!! Fire BHO is on sale for $13 per gram! All Bodhi High concentrates are $30 and Dorado Oil is $19 per gram!
5219 2018-01-10 16:04:07 Why would any coastal State want oil rigs? 

The drilling decision will go to court due to Florida being removed.
5220 2018-01-10 16:04:05 UCP say they're gonna make Alberta prosperous again. How? Are they going to bring back triple digit oil prices? Cause that would take some Harry Potter shit right there.

#ableg #theendofgrowth
5221 2018-01-10 16:04:04 I suspect it's because oil and gas have paid for so many politician puppets that any threat to their bottom line becomes a common sense vs propaganda argument. It's a discussion which wouldn't take place if money weren't in politics. Further...the Petro dollar cycle.
5222 2018-01-10 16:04:02 Delaware voted Blue.  No leverage with Trump.  Drill Baby Drill.  We need the oil to be energy independent.  Jobs, Jobs, Jobs.  JM
5223 2018-01-10 16:03:57 Florida has oil rigs off their coast in the Gulf of Mexico. They’re beyond the horizon so you can’t see them.
5224 2018-01-10 16:03:49 เนอะคะะะ > < ขอบคุณมากค่าาา♥︎
5225 2018-01-10 16:03:34 Literally: to sell oil
5226 2018-01-10 16:03:29 The crew Muttley & Cattley all love coconut. They get dried strips for a treat & a small amount of coconut oil in their food a few days a week.
5227 2018-01-10 16:03:21 Crude oil has gone to 60's from 40's. LUV offering $56 flights specials... Really 
5228 2018-01-10 16:03:18 I would Google No Poo lifestyles. Your hair will freak the first month, but then oil production slows down once it realizes it's not getting washed away every day. A lot of up-dos!
5229 2018-01-10 16:03:16 Coconut oil saved my life
5230 2018-01-10 16:03:15 Well, he knows better than to sully his own front yard. Besides, why do we need more oil when the clear trend these days is sustainable energy? Protecting the natural resources we still have should be top priority.
5231 2018-01-10 16:03:05 Just a publicity stunt. Arrogant lying Zinke doesn't listen to anybody except special interest big oil, beef & timber industries & mining. He loves stealing taxpayers money by flying around making secret back room deals. When asked about these records he refuses to release them.
5232 2018-01-10 16:03:03 well I was gonna go get my iPhones battery changed but that shit is booked up for the next week  so it looks like an oil change is gonna be the highlight of my day
5233 2018-01-10 16:02:56 Oh, I forgot one more thing:   @realDonaldTrump has valuable coastal property (and wealthy clients) in FL that he visits weekly and has been dubbed the Winter White House.  I heard ocean views are spectacular. Wouldn’t want offshore oil wells to mess that up, would we?
5234 2018-01-10 16:02:53 well that's just great. why do you want to put oil rigs in my back yard?
5235 2018-01-10 16:02:52 Coconut oil

5237 2018-01-10 16:02:39 Our prices closely track the crude oil price, we pass on reductions as quickly as we can, and shield our customers from dramatic price increases. - Alisha. 2/2
5238 2018-01-10 16:02:30 I'm pretty sure that coconut oil will be involved in my untimely demise.
5239 2018-01-10 16:02:25 Point is the NDP are not anti oil. They have continued existing projects, and encouraged investment - signing off on new projects in oil, gas, and chemicals in the province. I'm sorry this doesn't fit your narrative but it's reality. What agenda do you have if you deny reality?

5242 2018-01-10 16:02:17 Apparently petrol was actually just alcohol and they just put petrol in it so that people didn't drink it so that oil companies could make more money than alcohol
5243 2018-01-10 16:02:14 It is northwest of Austin now.  It was a campus for an oil company previously.
5244 2018-01-10 16:02:13 Ok so not answering the question directly BUT I use argon oil (from holland & barrett) it's basically great for face, hair, nails, body the lot. Light weight oil - not greasy. I don't like how creams/lotions make my skin feel... oils tend to work for me.
5245 2018-01-10 16:02:13 Which item(s) on this list constitute a counterexample to my claim that there's been no apparent ill effect of Trump's (purported) puppetry

Maybe you think I'm dumb but it's not immediately obvious why [oil co. A] signs deal with [oil co. B] in itself constitutes an ill-effect
5246 2018-01-10 16:02:07 Are you adding enough protein & fat to your salads?

A little protein goes a long way in a salad - and I go mad with olive oil, avos, nuts & seeds in my salad.
5247 2018-01-10 16:02:05 @BenCardinforMD @ChrisVanHollen @GovHogan @BrianFrosh @Call_Me_Dutch @RepSarbanes @RepRaskin Please speak out to Trump Adm & Sec Zinke to protect our Md coastline. We don't want TAR BALLS in the water like they have in Texas waters. You HAVE TO WASH OIL OFF OF YOU AT TX BEACHES!!
5248 2018-01-10 16:02:00 That a huge difference between the API and EIA data of over 6 million barrels! The drop in production (-290K bpd) is likely caused by the New-years,, so not really indicative.

5249 2018-01-10 16:01:49 #iranprotest When a regime sells oil to fund terrorism r the funds are not going to people, they should be stopped selling it. All the European countries that r sucking up to do business with Iran must know that they will be destroyed by protestors. This uprising is different.
5250 2018-01-10 16:01:38 Different forms. Carbon in the ground (oil) is burnt and mixes with the moisture in the air to make CO2. Nothing IS lost (I'm guessing you're working within the conservation of mass theory).

5253 2018-01-10 16:01:22 @Varneyco I find it ironic that after 8 long years, the democrats plsyed politics where republican sentiment was dissed. Now tables are turned with oil drilling exemptions and the dems don't like it and call it political. Absolutely laughable and hypocritical. The Pot & Kettle ??
5254 2018-01-10 16:01:18 One acre of hemp produces twice as much oil as an acre of peanuts and nearly four times as much fiber pulp (for paper) as an acre of tree. #HempDay #HempDayFact
5255 2018-01-10 16:00:38 What does Zinke mean, "Oil and Gas Platforms?"  The draft program was for leasing, not platforms per se.  Considering local views in CA and elsewhere, his remark "local voice matters" is absurd, not to mention dumber than a bag of hammers.

5262 2018-01-10 16:00:12 I always dread getting an oil change because I feel like they always find something wrong and try to push a sale 
5263 2018-01-10 16:00:08 @MeenanServices I am on day 2 of no heat. I have called your number numerous times. I was promised oil yesterday, no truck showed. Still waiting on that and service. When can I get some help?

5266 2018-01-10 15:59:27 what was that massive drop at 47 though do you think they just wanted to run stops?
5267 2018-01-10 15:59:20 I'm a Floridian and believe me Crooked Rick Scott is NOT TO BE TRUSTED. I'm glad they won't drill off of our coastline, but other states shouldn't have their coastlines and natural resources put at risk for big oil either!

5271 2018-01-10 15:58:55 I woke up re-mad at BP for their oil spill so I did some looking around to find that they arent planning on repaying even half of the billions of dollars for reparations & in 2015 they received about 223 BILLION dollars

5275 2018-01-10 15:58:45 Just not arrest , force him to eat food with same oil 
5276 2018-01-10 15:58:40 Coconut oil only used for solid-at-room-temp properties.    Probably could overconsume and get the runs if you made an effort.  :)
5277 2018-01-10 15:58:39 How the National Review defends Pruitt: “His critics may dismiss him as a creature of oil and gas, as an ogre who is willing to see the water and air despoiled in the service of his corporate allies, but he is in fact a true believer.”
5278 2018-01-10 15:58:39 Exactly and either does anyone else. We want our beaches free of oil spills.
5279 2018-01-10 15:58:35 @animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
5280 2018-01-10 15:58:21 Oil companies could be like tobacco companies. When tobacco products became unprofitable, they diversified by buying other companies. Oil execs could acquire solar, wind, other alternative energy firms. What’s stopping them? Ego?
5281 2018-01-10 15:58:12 Google is really hitting home runs with these targeted ads. You're right, Google. I absolutely DO need olive oil. ??
5282 2018-01-10 15:58:02 Do you really think President Trump cares about bad press?!?  It’s been rolling off him like water over an oil slick!
5283 2018-01-10 15:58:02 Your SEAact is going to sink. There are numerous other ways for job creation besides offshore oil drilling. LEAVE OUR COASTS ALONE.
5284 2018-01-10 15:58:01 We should focus on alternative fuel sources to protect Mother Earth not the Oil companies !

5293 2018-01-10 15:57:13 Wow you are defending the prospect of offshore oil spills?
5294 2018-01-10 15:57:03 I did some oil related this weekend. Not advice here but I did say "all clear to short hell outta oil". Ideal target is 54-55, not sure if we quite make it there. Know more as we go. check weekend update for dollar and gold. looking for 1200 gold next and dollar rally to 96-97.50
5295 2018-01-10 15:56:33 India's Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry announced that investment in oil and gas will return to previous highs this year.

5297 2018-01-10 15:56:31 That’s up to city! They can do it as backed by oil money and it’s a great PR exercise! Also helps to get fans through the turnstiles! Imagine what the crown would have been like last night of normal prices were charged

5299 2018-01-10 15:55:58 Exciting news from @NYCMayor @billmckibben today: NYC announces it will sue 5 major oil companies. My hometown will officially: 
end investments in companies wrecking our futures
take billionaires to task & make them pay 
pass the solutions we need
Your move, @NYGovCuomo.

So Nigeria has crude oil, has $40b in reserves..N3t in TSA.....they say.

So Nigeria has polio.....one of only three nations on earth to have polio.

Nigeria bought Polio vaccines from Japan but Mr Bill Gates is paying our bill of over $60m

5302 2018-01-10 15:55:48 Well I would like to say chocolate made with 100% coconut oil is 100% not chocolate. But some chocolatey flavored simulacrum. Which may or may not taste good I've never tried it. Can it not be overconsumed because of the diarrhea?

5304 2018-01-10 15:55:31 Il faut demander à @OIL_MEN, c'est de son ressort. Mais je crains qu'il ne confirme.
5305 2018-01-10 15:55:31 Kinda destroys their BS pro life talking points they hold onto like a shield. Protect inside the womb but you're on your own after birth. Their only policy is oppose whatever the dems want to do. More snake oil sales than business people.
5306 2018-01-10 15:55:23 U should be in share market or at least give some advice to brokerage houses, imagine how participants will benefit from rise in crude oil prices
5307 2018-01-10 15:55:22 Why do you think we don't use oil? Why don't you want our gas prices to go down? You could finally pay down the PERS and Madicade debt, instead of trying to tax us to fix it.

5309 2018-01-10 15:54:49 The tar balls you may find on the beaches of California would go away if drilling were allowed. They form from oil working it's way to the surface.  Drill and deplete those oil deposits and the beaches will become cleaner.
5310 2018-01-10 15:54:44 Zinke you are a piece of floating oil soaked shit. You come out to California and ignore what the people want? Good luck when you start trying to mess with our coast. You’re not welcome here.
5311 2018-01-10 15:54:42 The oil sands gave my mama breast cancer. I has baggage.
5312 2018-01-10 15:54:36 @DrewDawg @PeteinSD A lot of commodities like Oil and Copper are confirming that the dollar is in trouble.
5313 2018-01-10 15:54:35 Ugggggh who uses a real paper sticker as a oil change reminder. I’m never getting this off my windshield, let alone fast enough to avoid embarrassment with the mechanics over how long I waited to get said oil change. Not looking forward to that lecture 
5314 2018-01-10 15:54:16 The oil drilling that affects Florida is in the Gulf, so if that's what you mean it wouldn't be a player in that decision since Mar-A-Lago is on the Atlantic side.
5315 2018-01-10 15:54:11 He still has the Great Lakes in which to drill for oil and gas. Canada won't mind.
5316 2018-01-10 15:54:10 The @Interior department announced oil and gas drilling will be allowed off U.S. coastlines. @FLGovScott worked a "deal" to exempt FL. Probably a political stunt to benefit Scott's run for Democratic @SenBillNelson's seat.
5317 2018-01-10 15:53:59 Then, why are the Malaysian and Indonesian palm oil companies mounting a costly PR campaign against the Parliament's vote to phase out support for palm biodiesel? EU biofuels policy is today the top driver of palm oil demand in the EU and key around the world.
5318 2018-01-10 15:53:55 omg i have truffle pizza in the fridge and truffle chips in my room i love truffle oil ok the way to my heart is truffle

5324 2018-01-10 15:53:09 I have no problem with the Oil Sands.  I'm just realistic about the future of the fossil fuel industry.
5325 2018-01-10 15:53:05 We're sorry to hear that! Try saturating the KT Tape in a household oil like baby oil or olive oil for 5 minutes before removal. Also slowly pull the skin away from the tape. Let us know if this helps!
5326 2018-01-10 15:53:04 I have the oil from marleys smoke shop and I love it!
5327 2018-01-10 15:53:02 I feel bad for this customer  i have no oil , denied fuel asstance help months ago for living in illegal apt. I hope this person got heat for the kids.

5331 2018-01-10 15:52:39 Have we learned nothing from the experience of electing a television snake oil salesman already? @Oprah would just be just another one. No thanks #oprahforpresident2020
5332 2018-01-10 15:52:37 It's all those years of watching stunts on tv. Not only is this hazardous to his health but to the land this waste oil was dumped on. Imagine what one lit cigarette could have done? It's not just here this mentality. But definitely dangerous behaviour
5333 2018-01-10 15:52:33 Have you guys never had 100% chocolate made with coconut oil?   Very rich.   Impossible to overeat.   Put on top of ice cream while still liquid and it instantly solidifies giving you that chocolate "shell" you loved as a kit.
5334 2018-01-10 15:52:27 I have not tried that yet. I also have heard castor oil works well for that purpose too
5335 2018-01-10 15:52:22 The report says it was because of weakening gas prices and widening oil differentials, not the NDP. Why do always tell lies? #ableg
5336 2018-01-10 15:52:15 I have the privilege of hosting an outstanding group of @ussoy oil buyers from Korea this morning. It's truly great knowing they're demanding the very things #USSoy farmers continue producing and supplying our growing world. @USSEC

5340 2018-01-10 15:51:58 A rough day for CTAs today. Yen and flatteners. Correction in stocks will be horrible, DOE data should see oil lower.
5341 2018-01-10 15:51:54 Wait until your hair looks or feels oily, for me that's 2-3 days for you it could be longer but normally every 2-3 days is good. Also, i use shampoo with tea tree oil in it. Makes my hair super soft and healthy but it will strip dye. Coconut oil is also good for dead hair :)

5343 2018-01-10 15:51:45 what’s a dry oil
5344 2018-01-10 15:51:40 Oil/coal are DEAD! Renewable energy is the now  & future. Greed is the only thing keeping big oil profitable.
5345 2018-01-10 15:51:32 You're from a land locked state. Hands off our coasts. Invest instead in energy of the future not oil of the past.
5346 2018-01-10 15:51:29 Nope, oil going up. Big Time,  believe me. HUUUUGE Barrels of 80$ texas tea
5347 2018-01-10 15:51:27 Have you heard of the carbon cycle? Then tell me how, under natural circumstances, over 100 billion barrels of oil, most of it thousands to tens of thousands of feet deep, would make it to the surface without human intervention in less than 200 years?
5348 2018-01-10 15:51:18 They will pay for it! The 2 biggest GDP producers for Mexico are oil & remittances sent back. Now that our own oil production is better less we import. More illegals we get rid of less remittances! Y r democrats financial illiterates?!
5349 2018-01-10 15:51:17 I like my idea for a reality show. Take a beta boy Oberlin graduate with 200K student debt and a degree in lesbian dance theory. Send him to be a roughneck in the Bakken oil  field in N Dakota. Live in a man camp. If he lasts a year , erase his debt.

5353 2018-01-10 15:51:04 I think they're supposed to be pretty good, which prob explains why. Might have got shit in recent years but remember reading their stock was modern and decent and tickets cheap due to all the oil
5354 2018-01-10 15:50:39 *Shakes my head and gets off the bed, going to the kitchen to get some olive oil as I know that gets it off. Dabbing some tissue into it and rubs my upper lip, finally getting the marker off, mumbling to myself* Revenge will be sweet.

5357 2018-01-10 15:50:02 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
5358 2018-01-10 15:49:58 Vitamin e oil is really good for yuh skin too 
5359 2018-01-10 15:49:56 I'm for fairly limited federal with a few exceptions, myself.  W/drugs, only after extreme testing - marijuana, much as I can't stand the smell, isn't worse than alcohol really, so regulating it similarly would be good.  The non-high-enducing oil shouldn't even be a drug really.
5360 2018-01-10 15:49:47 added extra shares $ugaz 68 for a trade, get out b4 close

add new position in $dwt 12, continue to add if $oil headed to 65
5361 2018-01-10 15:49:41 There is no reason to be drilling for oil in Maine either. There are many whale sanctuaries out that way that are far more important than you and your oil. Fuck you and the horse you rode in too!!!

5369 2018-01-10 15:49:04 Exchange rate was average of N170 throughout the previous tenure, that's nearly HALF of the current exchange rate. Not to discuss cost of subsidy with oil price at $100. Please feel free to give kudos without talking about the unprecedented debt Buhari's admin is piling up.
5370 2018-01-10 15:49:02 if rising oil prices were pushing up yields because of inflation expectations shouldn't we be seeing break-evens also rise too?  BEs have been flat over the last few days while nominal yields are taking off.
5371 2018-01-10 15:49:02 So the administration wants to drill for oil on the coastlines of America, except Florida of course, because you can’t charge 350k at Mar Lago if there is a filthy oil rig just offshore

5382 2018-01-10 15:47:58 So then, will he also open it up to oil drilling, as well - or will this be a really real National Park? Like one that receives the respect and honor it deserves.

5406 2018-01-10 15:45:10 That woulda be invaluable like oil
5407 2018-01-10 15:45:01 That would be monopolistic and restrictive trade practice under the MRTP law, as buyer will be forced to buy from dealer a helmet that he may not like. Check the ruling related to oil marketers and gas stove.
5408 2018-01-10 15:44:54 u think chlorpyriphos is funny then check out 2-butoxyethanol, the endocrine-disrupting chemical agent in Corexit that degrades all oil sources (including our human cells) and is currently part of the fracking fluid that big ag & oil uses to water our crops with
5409 2018-01-10 15:44:45 There's maybe more you can do with tangible ideas like the oil rigs off of California, but we have plenty of evidentiary examples that he is willing to do the exact opposite of what he posited on the campaign trail to little criticism (tax bill, cabinet/swamp, stance on China)
5410 2018-01-10 15:44:44 No, I mean, do they bill labor (work done) separate from the oil thst they put in the vehicle?

5415 2018-01-10 15:44:13 I’m not either. Buuutttt I used olive oil, paprika, garlic powder and salt and pepper to season them. Came out good
5416 2018-01-10 15:44:03 1.) Every costal state should require special permits for oil transportation  over that states roads from every port.
2.) Deny all transportation permits for offshore oil production coming into ports.
3.) Effectively making Florida the ONLY costal state accepting offshore oil.
5417 2018-01-10 15:43:39 Domestic oil production down 290kbpd and NGL liquids up 275kbpd on the EIA weekly. Guess @HFI_Research was right to question the product classifications for recent growth.  #oott

5430 2018-01-10 15:42:35 BTW, over the past 7 years, I also found out that the widely claimed massive support of "climate skeptics" by big coal & oil is actually a MYTH created & propagated by #AGW activists. The biggest supporter of junk climate science until last year has been the US federal Gov.
5431 2018-01-10 15:42:30 If your car engine is burning oil the solution can't be to have extra oil in the trunk at all time, #justsaying

5434 2018-01-10 15:42:21 And how about Alaska, America’s last vestige of vast wilderness areas, w/varieties of wildlife & marine life not found in any of the Lower 48 States? The Trump Admin doesn’t seem to care about those treasures,which are worth far more than any single barrel of oil or piece of ore.

5436 2018-01-10 15:42:18 You should respect each other and refrain from disputes; you should not, like water and oil, repel each other, but should, like milk and water, mingle together.
5437 2018-01-10 15:42:14 Drilling for oil should be off the table on all coasts! We need to invest in renewable energy sources to replace harmful oil drilling
5438 2018-01-10 15:42:09 If you have not seen, first hand, what oil spills do to a coastline, the wildlife and economy of the area, perhaps you don't understand. We've been through this before. Don't want it again.
5439 2018-01-10 15:41:58 My fellow Californians are deluded with enviro-religious zeal.  CA won't even allow a new oil platform that would *replace* 4 old (but working) platforms, and be cleaner, and be beyond the shore's horizon.
5440 2018-01-10 15:41:53 But it is not every Nigerian responsibility to benefit from the oil. Criminals

5442 2018-01-10 15:41:48 Nope. Sorry. It’s all or none. As a resident of Florida, I’m thrilled, but you don’t get to cherry pick a red state over blue states. 

My hope is that each state will file a court ordered injunction that ties this BS promise to oil companies up in court before it ever happens.

How much do you typically think of the cost for an oil change is?
Do you go to a local mechanic or a chain service center?

5484 2018-01-10 15:37:28 It does have a lot of features of a rentier state, but it isn't a typical case. Oil industry is only 20% of the econ, tax revenues are surpassing oil revenues, and private sector is expanding. Human rights issues remain, but the country can escape the resource curse.

5514 2018-01-10 15:35:18 That makes no sense. The world  market is flush with petroleum. None of this oil will go to US for consumption or for production of goods. How about we subsidize clean energy sources that make us less dependent upon petroleum states like SA and Russia. Oh never mind.

5665 2018-01-10 15:24:50 Exactly. They put them where the oil is. If it's 100 miles off the coast, they put them there. If it's 200 yards off the coast, they put them there.

5687 2018-01-10 15:22:43 Put coconut oil in your coffee instead of creamer. You’re welcome.
5688 2018-01-10 15:22:43 California has become such a nuisance.  A it wrong for me to want an oil rig in every mile of the coast?  Oh and by the way Governor Moonbeam—you don’t own the ocean!

5693 2018-01-10 15:22:25 #PantsOnFire #45 doesn't want to devalue his gaudy craphole resorts and estates with drilling platforms and oil spills.  #hypocrite
5694 2018-01-10 15:22:25 I must be a super hero because I have been seeing oil platforms from the coast of California since the 1960s.  Drive the 101 near Ventura/Santa Barbara and they are clearly visible.
5695 2018-01-10 15:22:20 Trump doesn’t want oil drilling in Florida to affect his business interests or ocean front view. So crass policy making.
5696 2018-01-10 15:22:16 Car maintenance literally gives me anxiety.  I just need change oil next thing you know something wrong with the car.
5697 2018-01-10 15:22:15 Damm I hate waiting. Currently waiting for the whip to get a oil change.
5698 2018-01-10 15:22:12 Do I have this right? @realDonaldTrump announces he’s opening all coastal waters to oil exploration. @MMFlint says Great, I’m going to get a rig and drill right in front of Mar-A-Lago - and Trump says “oh, except for Florida”? #ethics
5699 2018-01-10 15:22:11 Yung accidentally mong nahulog at nabasag yung bagong bili na efficascent oil.  Saklap! #titosofmanila
5700 2018-01-10 15:22:10 #MyMaine How would Maine's economy survive an oil spill, if we don't sue the Trump Administration to stop drilling of the coast I of MAINE? Where is our Governor and State Attorney General?
5701 2018-01-10 15:22:09 Did u know most oil heat households accessing fuel assistance will exhaust benefits this week & rest by end Jan?! #heatinghelpma #mapoli

5703 2018-01-10 15:22:02 Oil seems to have got way ahead of itself lately. expect it to settle around $60-65
5704 2018-01-10 15:21:58 This coconut oil have me smelling like the tropics 
5705 2018-01-10 15:21:43 You missed your calling. Should have been a snake oil salesman.
5706 2018-01-10 15:21:32 Really? All the safety improvements they made after Deepwater Horizon have been rescinded... Thanks to the trump administration. Oil companies couldn't be happier.
I'd like to see your reply but...

I'd say sorry... But I'm really not.

5708 2018-01-10 15:21:23 They have on multiple occasions suggested that illegals should vote, and we all know that some number of them do vote.
5709 2018-01-10 15:21:21 why would you want to ruin the Atlantic coast by drilling it? Are you an oil guy who will make money. I live two tenths of a mile from NC coast. Why are you a wrecking ball? Makes no sense. So much hate to want to ruin the coast.
5710 2018-01-10 15:21:05 yes, the world is laughing at us because we elected you as president. they are laughing because we ignored all of the red flags in your candidacy and in your background. we bought your snake oil salesman routine
5711 2018-01-10 15:21:04 Rinse and drain chick peas - pat dry. Toss with cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, S & P, oregano and turmeric. Then brown them in a little olive oil!
5712 2018-01-10 15:20:53 มันต้องมีซักคนแหละ :-)
5713 2018-01-10 15:20:52 Are you going to drill for oil on it now?
5714 2018-01-10 15:20:41 There should be no more offshore drilling. We should be looking at 21st century clean/green energy not 19th century oil drilling. We have the technology.
5715 2018-01-10 15:20:38 “Thou hast loved RIGHTEOUSNESS and hated INIQUITY; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the OIL OF GLADNESS above  thy fellows.” (HEB 1: 9; KJV) 
5716 2018-01-10 15:20:36 In the UK, the taxpayer has to cough-up 50% of the decommissioning costs incurred clearing up the oil & gas industry's mess in the North Sea. Receive subsidies when you start and receive subsidies when you stop. Win-Win No wonder oil & gas are not worried about stranded assets.
5717 2018-01-10 15:20:25 I guess the site of a oil rig from the lush confines of the club house is upsetting to the wealthy members of @realDonaldTrump golf course. Too bad the rest of the coast line could not be protected.
5718 2018-01-10 15:20:20 神戸は修学旅行以来2度目でしたが、とっても楽しかった！いいところですよね
5719 2018-01-10 15:20:13 No oil on those.  They were all in the eastern end of island
5720 2018-01-10 15:20:11 Baka yung sabon na gamit mo di ganon ka effective, try mo sabayan with oil clear sheet

5722 2018-01-10 15:19:58 Will it mix with a moisturizer? Depending on the base it might not mix with a gel moisturizer but may mix with an oil based, or vice versa.
5723 2018-01-10 15:19:46 So the state of Florida can prevent off shore oil exploration because the governor (Scott, a GOP) can be trusted? What about WA or CA? No GOP no trust--right Sec Zinke?
5724 2018-01-10 15:19:43 We ought to open a spigot of oil off the NY/NJ coast just cuz we can.
5725 2018-01-10 15:19:32 おつかれさまでした。今日はご挨拶できなくてごめんなさい。次回現場でお会いした時はよろしくお願いします。
5726 2018-01-10 15:19:31 Well said Jackie, please keep fighting! Zinke is a pawn everyone knows it. He doesn't know that CA sits on the Pacific Rim of earthquakes. Once one of these oil rigs goes down the fault will be his. His name will forever be in History books as an idiot. FIGHT!
5727 2018-01-10 15:19:23 The trouble is that living wage means different things to different people, and skill can be largely substituted for money.

I can and do live well on $8,000 per year. But I can cook, change my oil, and live with a roommate.  Does that mean companies should pay $4 per hour?

5733 2018-01-10 15:18:48 Actually, California's pristine beaches are built by Forces of nature that existed before man or oil or racism or pollution. Cool story though.
5734 2018-01-10 15:18:35 India is the biggest palm oil buyer in the world. China is a potential biofuels market so Malaysia is aiming to corner the market. More aspirational than concrete deals.
5735 2018-01-10 15:18:34 Have you forgotten Fukushima? 
Sorry to break it to you, but Pacific waters are full of radioactive goop already. 
Sadly, oil or radioactive materials are all bad.
5736 2018-01-10 15:18:30 Boris actually: 

I don't care.
OIL!
Time to casually joke about curry eaters.
May's problem, not mine.
Is there oil there? No, ignore them then.
More lobster for my dinner parties.
Same thing isn't it?
5737 2018-01-10 15:18:20 Thanks for following up. Nothing worth elaborating on. Just no oil in inventory at the store. Things happen. Just was a little surprised since that’s your core business. I’ll be back.

5740 2018-01-10 15:17:55 If that orange fuck head, @realDonaldTrump thinks that he can drill off my coast without me protesting he’s got another thing coming. Fucking moron, talk to a scientist. Look at a map of existing oil spills and grow a heart

5744 2018-01-10 15:17:44 so my doctor said i have to take fish oil and calcium pills daily right? and the fact that more calcium intakes means height increase right?
5745 2018-01-10 15:17:38 Or oil or whatever. all currency is tricky from a Marxist perspective tho
5746 2018-01-10 15:17:37 1.) Every costal state should require special permits for oil transportation  over that states roads from every port.
2.) Deny all transportation permits for offshore oil production coming into ports.
3.) Effectively making Florida the ONLY costal state accepting offshore oil.

5748 2018-01-10 15:17:29 You see Trump Admin backed off drilling for oil off the Florida coast after Governor Scott pressed them to back off? I guess it’s not a great idea when it’s in your own backyard.
5749 2018-01-10 15:17:28 Yes, that is one possible oil you could use!
5750 2018-01-10 15:17:26 you and your coconut oil 
5751 2018-01-10 15:17:26 There’s a Trump golf course in Palos Verdes. Maybe someone should remind him its property value will go down with views of oil rigs offshore.
5752 2018-01-10 15:17:19 .@reprussellott What is your stance on opening up leasing rights for oil drilling in SC waters?

5755 2018-01-10 15:16:54 How will oil spills from drilling off the Texas or Louisiana coasts avoid Florida?
5756 2018-01-10 15:16:53 うお、大丈夫か？
5757 2018-01-10 15:16:44 And your hotels in Florida (where you blocked oil drilling, just for you) are anchor baby factories for Russian women. Paid for by dirty Russian money that you're happy to receive. They just shut down a similar set up in Ca., ICE should stop yours next.
5758 2018-01-10 15:16:42 The time for green energy is now!Coal & oil are becoming fossils yet again.
5759 2018-01-10 15:16:41 If it’s all about America First with you lot why are you concerned about other countries? Oh THATS right - it’s only that when it suits you and Iran has oil!
5760 2018-01-10 15:16:34 Made the switch to coconut oil for my hair. I think now my hair is ready for it. Plus it’s lighter than the Shea butter I’m using.
5761 2018-01-10 15:16:33 SP: New Year optimism in the CPP market in the west, putting upward pressure on ex-South America veg oil freight rates to both India and China.
5762 2018-01-10 15:16:31 Will it work with rapeseed oil? Thinking of the air miles. And no oats 
5763 2018-01-10 15:16:28 Coconut oil instead of cocoa butter. That one makes sense.
5764 2018-01-10 15:16:27 Brought my moms truck to the dealership for an oil change and a rotation.. now I want a new car  

MUST RESIST!!!
5765 2018-01-10 15:16:26 .@POTUS That's because the Liar-In-Chief asked him to do that. Otherwise there would be an oil platform right off the coast from Mar-A-Largo!!
5766 2018-01-10 15:16:22 I really wanted to get some coconut oil & pick up my stuff from the jeweler but these clouds have a mean set up...
5767 2018-01-10 15:16:18 Coconut oil is MAGICAL for hair, eyebrows and lashes

5770 2018-01-10 15:16:03 .@TempletonCath What is your stance on opening waters off of SC to oil drilling? Seems that would be a big negative for Myrtle Beach, Charleston and SC in general.
5771 2018-01-10 15:15:54 Donald Trump doesn't want an oil spill washing up on the beach at his Mar a Lago Club.
5772 2018-01-10 15:15:36 Actually a lot has been done and the oil company has left the park! Thank you for your support :)
5773 2018-01-10 15:15:35 Rising oil prices will create an interesting Russia-US-OPEC dynamic. Especially with protests in #Iran and reform in #KSA underway. Russia could definitely use higher prices, but some in OPEC, per @FT, want lower prices to block US shale production. 2018 will be fun.
5774 2018-01-10 15:15:34 I really need a better pu truck but 208,000 miles and doesn't use or leak oil..hard to change. #f150farmtough

5776 2018-01-10 15:15:31 Omg, I could never put oil on in the morning. I’d look like a greasy mess lol
5777 2018-01-10 15:15:28 And Shri @NandanNilekani the windfall gain on lower oil prices not seen anywhere.  If so much gained,  why the renowned n highly knowledgeable FM forced to borrow  50,000 cr. And last I heard while that midnight GST drama about GDP going up by 2% and tax collection vl hit ceiling

5780 2018-01-10 15:15:06 Don’t worry Claude...California and the rest of the American taxpayers will get to pick up the tab for the eventual oil spill...as Florida has zero regulations preventing them. They want no regulation or responsibility for the mess they make....sounds like Florida to me

5789 2018-01-10 15:14:09 If anything Venezuela has demonstrated the failure of planed economies. And before you somehow blame the U.S for their ruin, we subsidized that mess for years by buying half of their oil output.
5790 2018-01-10 15:14:07 Yup.. that's why oil drilling is on its way, but not in Florida.

5796 2018-01-10 15:13:21 Bad enough it'll soon be under water. Why expedite property value loss with an oil slick.

5804 2018-01-10 15:12:31 Ahahahaha yanno I’m NOT a Rick Scott fan, but my governor just told the Trump administration that they’re not drilling for oil off the coast of Florida, and those motherfuckers basically said, “okay.” 
5805 2018-01-10 15:12:23 This is a good use of Iranian oil!
5806 2018-01-10 15:12:18 Does the dicision to not drill for oil in Florida has something to do with protecting Mara largo? Nah, how can I be so brash.Beware of " Geeks " bearing gifts. Isaac Newton said; for every action there is a like and equal reaction.Stop drill - save Mara Largo.
5807 2018-01-10 15:12:08 I damn near spent 200 for a oil change an a mirror bulb

Is that why there are seven oil installations under construction totaling 33 billion dollars of investment?
#FactsMatter #AbLeg
5812 2018-01-10 15:11:50 Are you seriously denying that the scale of #palmoil demand affects the sale of palm oil production? That seems a desperate argument.
5813 2018-01-10 15:11:46 Honestly. I have to pick some up at dinner time so I can have it in the morning at regular people breakfast times. But at the end of the day, all they have is the oil left with one two red peppers and a gram of saltfish
5814 2018-01-10 15:11:44 Should probably get my oil changed today lol

5829 2018-01-10 15:10:25 I guess you were too stupid to realize that Senator Feinstein was giving you the benefit of the doubt until proper evidence was given to the committee. You deserve a tar and feathering (and not from the Oil platforms off the Texas coastline but from the coast of Mar a Lago)
5830 2018-01-10 15:10:23 @SecretaryZinke - @realdonaldtrump wants offshore oil drilling behind Mara-Lago. Take Florida off the table except for Mara-Lago area.

5838 2018-01-10 15:09:29 Things start to happen. In Norway, although climate activists recently lost their first trial against the Government to stop Arctic oil drilling, our right to a healthy environment was confirmed, based on the Constitution. We will come back to protect future generations.

5840 2018-01-10 15:09:24 No, instead we use public funds to build and maintain highways and roads, provide police to monitor inherently unsafe machines (automobiles), and incentivize motor vehicles in many other ways. Not to mention tax breaks for oil and gas.

5845 2018-01-10 15:08:57 How odd. @YouTube has deleted my beer reviews of Gouden Carolus Classic and Old Engine Oil. No idea why.
5846 2018-01-10 15:08:52 Just because a product in the store is labeled non gmo and vegan it still can have harmful ingredients in it like soy and canola oil
5847 2018-01-10 15:08:48 .@RyanZinke Political revenge tactics will be exposed. Kickbacks from oil cos will be carefully traced. Yr incompetence is highlighted w/each self-serving, environmentally destructive decision you pull out of Trump’s butt. As u prostrate yrself to Trump, we will walk over you.
5848 2018-01-10 15:08:48 But the Iranian oil sanctions question looms - bet on shale or bet on Trump?
5849 2018-01-10 15:08:44 @TheSocialCTV to be an 'experienced politician' at this point typically means skilled in corruption and collusion; experience in politics does not mean stronger leadership. What's her Stance on oil - she could END WAR. Would she heed scientists? That's crucial for next POTUS
5850 2018-01-10 15:08:39 No rush on China/RF part since they get more bang (oil/gold) for their buck before reval. West should be sweating though due to chips stacking in east. The longer this goes on, the better positioned Cina/RF are.

5861 2018-01-10 15:08:00 Interesting article, but it doesn't take into account US oil resources. And China's artificial yuan value.  Not saying it's wrong.
5862 2018-01-10 15:07:54 @SecretaryZinke Governors on every effected coast, the 'local voices' that matter, have been screaming about this from the moment the short-sighted, disastrous policy, a GIFT to no one but the gas/oil industry, was announced!
Only Red-State voices matter??
5863 2018-01-10 15:07:51 1. If by conquering land, you mean murdering its inhabitants and not honoring agreements, then sure. 2.

If we had a world free of nukes, it would now be the world against USA
5875 2018-01-10 15:06:54 No doubt. I have a feeling Russian influence runs VERY deep in our Republic. Let's hope the end result is not just Trump & Co going to jail but also an amendment that gets the money out of the process. Without billions in oil $$ Russian influence means nothing.

So next time he should THINK before he signs.
5880 2018-01-10 15:06:18 @RyanZinke I just saw a map of the US showing the 10 states that you & President Trump have approved for offshore drilling. The way you are prioritizing big oil over our environment is abhorrent. LEAVE OUR OCEANS AND SEA LIFE ALONE!

5889 2018-01-10 15:05:26 @ELLMEHL: your tweets are too illogically laser-focused on minutia for you to not be a bot or a troll. Point is: yes oil rigs are ugly. Yes, there are many already existing. Donald just rolled back regulations, so we'll see more DeepWaterHorizons disasters in the future.
5890 2018-01-10 15:05:21 In fairness @jkenney and @stephenharper didn't campaign in Quebec and Ontario promising to kill the oil and gas sector...
5891 2018-01-10 15:05:12 Basically, if you have to buy cheap oil purchase from California or the Mediterranean; otherwise it will be infused with addictive cheaper oils.

2.) Deny all transportation permits for offshore oil production coming into ports.
3.) Effectively making Florida the ONLY costal state accepting offshore oil.

5928 2018-01-10 15:01:58 There is absolutely no need for shale gas in Scotland....as your link explains.

5955 2018-01-10 14:59:38 Fla gets exemption of offshore drilling because coastline so important to tourism. Two things:
Isn't this admission that there could be disastrous oil spills? 
Will the same consideration be given to NJ or any other blue state?
5956 2018-01-10 14:59:32 How market perception changes,,, when crude oil dropped from 115 to 70 many almost all were happy and some fund manager even suggested that indian govt should hedge for long term @ $70. But now when crude price increased from 30 to 70 everyone is nervous.... #CrudeOil #Brent

5963 2018-01-10 14:58:27 We need to drill so the Middle east can drink their own oil.

5965 2018-01-10 14:58:23 If your science does not align with government dogma, then you are "in the pocket of oil companies".  But if you are literally in the pocket of the government, then your "science" is beyond reproach. This is the contradiction one must accept to be a global warming alarmist.
5966 2018-01-10 14:58:10 They claim that gas/oil wells aren't a danger, so it really shouldn't be necessary to exempt any state.

Unless they are lying about the danger.

6006 2018-01-10 14:55:03 Don't forget the water currents will take the oil to the nearby States if a spill where to occur. So drilling off the coast of Louisiana effects Florida Gulf Coast as evidence of the disaster that occurred with BP.

6011 2018-01-10 14:54:43 The Deepwater Horizon rig wasn't in FL waters, the oil spread over several states.  

This move by @SecretaryZinke is 100% political and is a joke. A rig in Alabama waters will damage FL as Deepwater showed.

6015 2018-01-10 14:54:17 It was just a political stunt (opening drilling, not your awesome idea) to give Scott points with us since he is going to run for Senate. His campaign literature can say “stopped oil drilling off the coast of Florida”.
6016 2018-01-10 14:54:12 I'm more interested in my share prices really, but I remember some relief at the "No" vote because we had dodged a bullet since the oil price was below $30. Now the sustained recovery period seems to be getting little attention.
6017 2018-01-10 14:54:04 If we look at what China's been doing, the question IMO is not what USD value China will place on oil, but what gold value will China (& Russia) place on oil.  If that CNY gold/oil ratio is different (higher) than the USD gold/oil ratio, it would be a powerful USD trump card.

6053 2018-01-10 14:51:22 What state is "similarly situated"? FL is unique, in that it's mostly a peninsula, vulnerable to hurricanes more than other states, and dmg to off-shore oil rigs a higher potential risk.

6061 2018-01-10 14:50:50 A couple of questions: 1) are other coastlines, like CA, OR, and WA not reliant on tourism, and 2) by removing FL because of the importance of its coastline are you admitting to the environmental risk of offshore oil drilling?

6065 2018-01-10 14:50:21 Starting pay for a mudlogger, the most grunt-level of grunt workers in the oil industry, literal bottom of the totem pole, can earn 1900 for two weeks straight of 12 hour workdays starting out.

6100 2018-01-10 14:47:52 @visitnc @SierraClub  Love your Outer Banks!  Wonder how much my friends vacation rental home would be worth if an oil slick moved onto those beautiful beaches!  I bet I could get a deal for a cheap rental then!  Sign onto Florida Deal!

6102 2018-01-10 14:47:50 Agree, oil dives currency, it’s easy to see in the market if you look.  ..but better currency create a better distribution system to collect and consume oil. Reflexive and cycling supply/demand dynamic.

6107 2018-01-10 14:47:17 Thank you. No footpaths since years from Bishop's and St. Mary's School till Indian oil chowk and broken pathways from chowk till MG bus stand. It's scary bcuz of vehicles and buses moving on the footpaths and no place to walk #Pune

6113 2018-01-10 14:45:59 I think it's a little deeper than that. I believe it envolves not only our legislators but their 1%, Corporations and lobbyists as well who invested in their plans of robbing & pillaging America of its natural resources. Hmm did Mar A Lago have anything to do with Florida oil?
6114 2018-01-10 14:45:46 Blend 9 tsps Ahi Tuna with 2 tablespoons grits. Add Olive Oil. Roast. Serve with a nice chianti.
6115 2018-01-10 14:45:39 Olive oil has antifungal and antibacterial properties that help soothe an aggravated scalp dealing with issues like itching, dandruff, and clogged follicles. Dandruff and clogged follicles are the leading causes of hair loss.

6121 2018-01-10 14:45:26 Wow. First of all Kim oil prices are extremely low. Offshore drilling would not reduce the cost to fill up your SUV (more drilling is bad policy right now). Aside from that your ineptitude  on this issue is shocking, I almost feel dumb saying Deepwater Horizon.

6123 2018-01-10 14:45:23 California has had a ban on offshore drilling since the early 80s in order to preserve our coastline, which already has problems from natural oil seepage. Your daddy is going to make things worse, and is going against the will of Californians. #OilDrilling #impeachtrumpnow

6127 2018-01-10 14:44:57 @DVEValPorter Thanks Val It was Nice to just hear Koyak and Oil City on DVE  :-)
6128 2018-01-10 14:44:48 @VisitVirginia @chinco_dot_com @SierraClub Loved my visit to your Island and viewing your coastline, lighthouses, and wild horses!  Get your state in on the same deal as Florida to protect the coastline so I can bring my little girl back for an oil slick free visit!
6129 2018-01-10 14:44:45 Well I think I actually spilled a glass of motor oil that @Jerrun85  was drinking idk that I would call it beer

6133 2018-01-10 14:44:28 You know Trump didn’t mean for oil drilling to be off Florida. 
Just everywhere else. He doesn’t get it. The money is in renewable energy not oil. That is an old mans way of thinking. Trump is not looking towards the future, our future.
6134 2018-01-10 14:44:22 You love coconut oil don’t you
6135 2018-01-10 14:44:22 I had washed it down first, was covered in oil from a crack in one section.
6136 2018-01-10 14:44:19 Shouldn't there be an assessment of whether oil actually even exists off the coast before we blow up the shore?  I suspect this is Trumpkin's way of heading off any more unsightly wind farms :).
6137 2018-01-10 14:44:00 thinking about the chili-infused olive oil they give you at fancy pizza places
6138 2018-01-10 14:43:58 Bet there are back door oil deals with Russia.
6139 2018-01-10 14:43:57 Ironic your dad fought against windmills off the coast of Scotland (near his golf course) but is OK with oil drilling off the US coast (except in swing states like Florida).  Care to comment Jr?
6140 2018-01-10 14:43:57 We are already getting profit from our oil? 80 bn shillings worth!that Salgaa road ought to get done this year!

6145 2018-01-10 14:43:21 @SecretaryZinke I guess because the west coast didn't support Trump you're going to punish us with oil rigs?  None of us want them.

6168 2018-01-10 14:40:33 It definitely isn't, but I've had a red bump over the piercing that at first I thought might turn out to be a keloid scar but now I think is a different kind of scarring so I'm hoping the oil will help calm it down

6171 2018-01-10 14:40:24 I get it.  From my perspective Trump is going after everything that favors Democrats or blue states.  They announced a week ago an expansion in oil drilling off the coast, then yesterday rescinded that order for Florida, but not for any blue states.

6180 2018-01-10 14:39:44 This is probably happening in raw soybeans, too.  More CO2, higher yields, but lower protein (and maybe higher oil).

6192 2018-01-10 14:38:32 Conflation of African economic growth with global commodity prices needs to end. Nigeria will soon be in the top 15 global economies, and that growth will be driven by services and manufacturing rather than oil and gas.
6193 2018-01-10 14:38:27 It’s so hard! I’m combo/dry. I thought I was oily for the longest because my face was like an oil slick growing up but I had just destroyed my moisture barrier so it was overcompensating! Crazy things we learn. I have a trial next month so I’m super stressed 
6194 2018-01-10 14:38:18 When oil fell from $110 to $30, US GDP growth got worse, not better.  US now massive energy producer that is intensely sensitive to price.  $4 gasoline = + for US GDP growth.  + for TSLA.  + for US corporate earnings & stocks.

6208 2018-01-10 14:36:52 In the past the economic gravity of Indonesia was in the East such as indicated by the high economic roles of spices.

6209 2018-01-10 14:36:38 This is so true, Eilidh. The cost of decommissioning ought to be written into the contracts as being the responsibility of the oil companies & hope they do a proper job of it. Same situation with nuclear. Short-term thinking.

6227 2018-01-10 14:35:39 Nothing has changed. They sold us the War in Iraq, built on lies.
I fear:  bottom line is another war for oil in Iran, which was the goal way back then. We know Russia wants it.  
So we'd go into WWIII--just horrible carnage--to satisfy a bunch of greedy oligarchs.

6229 2018-01-10 14:35:26 Take New Jersey off the list for offshore drilling too, tourism at the shore is the core of the state's economy. We can't afford an oil spill in our waters.

Plz listen to the "Mann ki Baat" of 10661 candidate who burnt their midnight oil to get a job and now suffering due to lethargy of SSC and judiciary.#Save_SSC_CGL #Save_CGL_16 @PMOIndia @DrJitendraSingh
6238 2018-01-10 14:34:27 in 1911, the Supreme Court deemed Standard Oil too big to exist, splitting it into 34 companies, including two that became ExxonMobil. 

Starting the Corporate empire
6239 2018-01-10 14:34:24 Drive CA coast on RT 1 and 101, then drive I 95 in FL. There's no comparison. I'd opt to drill every square inch of Mar a Lago before an oil rig is gets anywhere near Pebble Beach, Spy Glass or Torrey Pines
6240 2018-01-10 14:34:24 @carloslcurbelo "Russian state oil major Rosneft in May resumed fuel shipments to Cuba for the first time this century."
6241 2018-01-10 14:33:51 I'm good babes. Bloody viruses. Awful. Burn those oils Amy Tea Tree oil n Olbas oil. Helps lungs
6242 2018-01-10 14:33:45 If your felonious father couldn’t get Zinke to stop oil rigs off of mar-a-lago, you’d be concerned about a leak too. You’re as freaking STUPID as your old man. Apple didn’t fall far from his tree, did it?  Mueller has a red bead drawn right between your eyes. GOING DOWN
6243 2018-01-10 14:33:34 I love my fro man, tonight imma comb it out and put some almond oil in it
6244 2018-01-10 14:33:29 This is far worse than the Gulf!!!!
Oil oil everywhere....a dirty, dangerous material..... why do we continue to poison ourselves over and over?

6246 2018-01-10 14:33:04 I don't mind packing his lunch, its a home cooked meal in a thermos. He can't leave his job to get food, he works at an oil refinery. Harsh environment, awful hours, dangerous occupation.
He is extremely supportive of me & takes care of our boys as I campaign for U.S. Senate.
6247 2018-01-10 14:32:58 the guy told me i had no oil on my dipstick when i came in to get to get my oil changed and im like yea sounds about right
6248 2018-01-10 14:32:50 My mami is an expert when it comes to applying hair oil.. itna mast maalish karti hai that neeeeeeeeeend aa jaati hai
6249 2018-01-10 14:32:36 Ripe plantain fried in onion infused oil, Jesus!!!!! The sweetness is out of this world.
6250 2018-01-10 14:32:29 Oil price for forward delivery is set when contract transacted. Question is what $ price is China prepared to bid at spot USD/CNY rate at point of sale? To extent China withdraws bids/liquidity from ICE complex & bids on Shanghai instead then this could be interesting.

6256 2018-01-10 14:32:15 Seriousily when has gs called oil price right last 5 years?  anybody?
6257 2018-01-10 14:31:54 I will!!!! I ordered a thing of organic tea tree oil bc I tried hydrogen peroxide and a mix of antibacterial soap with warm water and it hasn't gotten better
6258 2018-01-10 14:31:46 I use cocoa butter and I mix it with coconut oil and sunflower oil get the right level of absorption and consistency
6259 2018-01-10 14:31:35 Coconut oil is really the plug for this cold weather ..
6260 2018-01-10 14:31:32 Excellent effort. Needs to continue. Two more games before their break. Absolutely need these two wins. No excuse in AZ. LV would be a steal but the Oil are due. Then sit on your hands for a week and watch the standings 
6261 2018-01-10 14:31:26 Drilling for oil is boring.
6262 2018-01-10 14:31:14 CA has also been hit with oil spill disasters.
NO STATE should be subject to this corrupt money grab.
6263 2018-01-10 14:31:09 @nyanducha @wmnjoya  Tullow Oil is providing yet another opportunity for those who work hard! Gluttons are impatiently waiting
6264 2018-01-10 14:31:08 Amid criticism from @SenBillNelson & others that @SecretaryZinke excluded FL from oil drilling plan mainly as a sop to @POTUS political ally @FLGovScott, Zinke spox calls it "nonsense lodged by politically motivated organizations and individuals."
6265 2018-01-10 14:31:06 We know about pirates on the high seas; here we have our own brand of pirates dressed up in three piece suits, the Plutocrats,  who are plundering our seas and land for oil, natural gas, fish, and minerals.  It’s a land and sea grab with Trump leading the way.

6280 2018-01-10 14:30:19 …if a state doesn't want drilling off its coast, the state doesn't have to provide support to oil companies either…logistics and drilling regulations are part of the equation as to whether its profitable to get the oil out of the ground…
6281 2018-01-10 14:30:17 True that

But lets just put this another way Florida isn't only state known for its beaches and tourism generated

California the Carolinas New Jersey just a few

Potential oil spills damage to environment to commercial fishing

There are no positives to drilling off OUR coasts
6282 2018-01-10 14:30:16 #WorkdBank: WB project that global oil prices would average $58 a barrel in 2018, edging up to $59 per barrel in 2019.

6296 2018-01-10 14:29:38 No, actually the opposite is true
Because TAR sands is the dirtiest most energy intensive oil to extract, it will be the first to go as the world transitions to renewables

6319 2018-01-10 14:27:48 same with hydrating and moisturizing

hydrating - it gives moisture in the form of water and humectants. oil is not moisture, emollient and occlusive yun

6327 2018-01-10 14:26:52 I prefer using oils for my anxiety. Proper sleep is really hard to come by when you're anxious. Currently I take chamomile oil every night, and rotate either passionflower oil or catnip oil along with it. The oils are put in a bit of water and taken like a shot.

6373 2018-01-10 14:19:58 I was here 8 yrs ago when the worst oil spill in US history happened. I went to the beach and saw the devastation..it was awful. Yet I think it has nothing to do w learning from that horrific event & more to our POS Gov who's prolly gonna run for a US Senate seat
6374 2018-01-10 14:19:52 You and I are like oil and water
And we've been trying, trying, trying
Ooh, to mix it up

I've been smiling with anchors on my shoulders
And I've been dying, dying, dying
Ooh, to let them go

6398 2018-01-10 14:18:00 Russia's goal in Arctics officially is to grab more area for Russia in hunt for oil/gas. Note - Russia doesnt have own technologies to extract oil/gas in Arctic. Such tech is presumably under sanctions now. Why the west is not worried?

6401 2018-01-10 14:17:36 Plus we should be installing clean power in the US instead of getting in bed with big oil, & drilling our coasts. One man cant make that decision with no hearings, I suspect kickbacks, payoffs are in play because prez just isn't trustworthy

6407 2018-01-10 14:17:12 It's probably better for the oil to burn off than to just be released to cover everything in that area of the ocean. Also, we here in The USA have developed microbes that will consume/eat the crude oil when you apply them to the oil while at sea--but I bet that's not being used.

6443 2018-01-10 14:14:18 That looks like the life rafts we use on oil rigs when you have to evacuate. Sure that where they got the idea. The store them in barrels that open up when they hit the water.
6444 2018-01-10 14:14:15 Offshore drilling is uneconomical.  New wells won’t be drilled.  Oil can be produced at a “fracktion” of the cost on land.
6445 2018-01-10 14:14:09 Facts and @GOP are like oil and water. It’s obvious this is their mind set.

6457 2018-01-10 14:13:00 Agreed; subsidies to oil companies are particulary obnoxious based on the money they tend to make. There may be a case, however, for subsidies to private companies that may have a large detrimental affect on the public if they fail; but the caveat here is the potential for abuse.
6458 2018-01-10 14:12:57 You can already lose fluids (such as fuel, coolant, oil...) but they won't form spills on the ground, and it's not planned either.
6459 2018-01-10 14:12:49 Yes- Iran was a rentier state in 1978 and still is. Iran has the capacity to be a thriving diversified economy, but getting most wealth from selling natural resources means the gov can maintain authoritarian control. Oil never demands respect for rule of law, human rights etc

6509 2018-01-10 14:08:31 Pleasing President Bone Spurs by exempting Mar-a-Lago from oil drilling will not be enough. We need all the states' rights to be obeyed, not just Trump's money-maker.

6515 2018-01-10 14:07:40 I agree completely, but this will not end while any kids they have here are citizens
6516 2018-01-10 14:07:14 Is it your view that there are no environmental implications in the extraction and refining of oil required to create plastic? And are you calling for heavier regulation and penalties for those who fail to dispose of plastic bags appropriately?
6517 2018-01-10 14:07:08 Apologies, “moron” isn’t exactly right. More like “emporer has no clothes”, carnival barking, snake oil salesman eventually to be exposed.
6518 2018-01-10 14:07:06 the answer is most likely the pervasiveness of the scent of fried eggs coupled with usage of the same oil and cooking vessels for multiple foods

6520 2018-01-10 14:07:03 Tenders dominate as Nigerian crude spot trading slows

Tenders dominated the crude market with Nigerian crude differentials  remaining at a relatively high level. Trading of Nigerian oil was limited by the pending tenders, as most of the buyers often take the nation’s oil.

6522 2018-01-10 14:06:53 Which is absurd!!! To protect his resort only FL is exempt but now all other states who are against this have to comply. Rachel Maddow shed light on this situation. In the tax cut bill they passed they cut the 9 cent /gal tax on oil sold in US which solely went into a slush...

6525 2018-01-10 14:06:43 So will renewable energy which is cheaper cleaner and providing more jobs than polluting the water and air with fossil fuels. NH has a very small coast line it would be a shame to put a few oil rigs out there so big corps can make money over putting solar panels on homes.
6526 2018-01-10 14:06:36 SMH. Like using tranny fluid as oil. Doesn't work.

6529 2018-01-10 14:06:15 @henrymcmaster What is your opinion on the president opening up the Atlantic coast to drilling? I would like to let you know that I would be against off shore oil drilling. Our coast line has some of the very best seafood and hosts people from all over the world. Save SC's coast.
6530 2018-01-10 14:06:06 OTDIH: 01/10/1901 a drilling derrick near Beaumont, Texas, produces an enormous gusher of crude oil, coating the landscape for hundreds of feet and signaling the advent of the American oil industry. The geyser was discovered at a depth of over 1,000 feet and took nine days to cap

6532 2018-01-10 14:05:53 Think about it: “People pray for the cake. Then God gives them the batter, eggs, oil, icing, a pan, an oven, they get get frustrated and leave the kitchen.” Let that sink. Sometimes you have everything right in front of you, but how bad do you want it ?

6541 2018-01-10 14:04:56 $TLT $GLD $DXY so the issue of the day seems to be quickly increasing rates? This could put in a bottom here for the dollar, which might not be the best thing for oil.

6543 2018-01-10 14:04:40 You got it bro. Stable power supply will affect the income of oil marketers and investors. But the interest of the majority should come first.

6549 2018-01-10 14:04:23 So you admit that off-shore oil drilling is potentially damaging to the environment to the extent you're concerned about the effects on Florida's economic interests? Sounds like someone is at least sipping the environmentalist Kool-Aid. #hypocrite
6550 2018-01-10 14:04:19 He's right. The oil revenues belong to the oil companies not Scotland. Scotland gets a 90% share of the tax take, nothing more nothing less. #simples

6570 2018-01-10 14:02:31 Why should Florida be taken off list. I say first rig should be right offshore by Mar a Lago.  Let it be our gift to trump. To look at oil wells every time he goes there.
6571 2018-01-10 14:02:06 Why is there oil there that he wants access to?
6572 2018-01-10 14:01:56 The problem is on your side. Although I'm not a VERIZON employee, much of my career in the offshore oil production  & marine industry consisted of finding solutions to  complex problems. I view this as fairly simple one. But first you have admit that it's your problem.

6612 2018-01-10 13:58:21 Im sure they are. The almost the whole coast line will be effected if they do drill. Also Florida is already a major oil state. Oil companies use the keys to flay back and forth the the rigs already up in the golf.

6636 2018-01-10 13:55:21 Our beaches and waterways have long been a huge resource for our state. If we wouldn’t put wind turbines in our ocean front why would we put ghastly oil platforms?
6637 2018-01-10 13:55:08 Weird dream: Son was doing some ceremony. I go up front w/ him only wearing 1 shoe. Whatevs. While priest is rubbing oil on my kid's head, my mom comes up carrying a baking dish, thinking this is the best time to give it back. Priest rubs oil on it too and shoos my mom away. 
6638 2018-01-10 13:55:01 Eh the links are from pro union rags, what is your point, did WM relinquish all links to NS oil all of a sudden, as it seems to be such a burden.
6639 2018-01-10 13:55:00 And yet no aid to victims of CA wildfires and now they want to auction off our coastline for oil drilling.
6640 2018-01-10 13:54:48 My skin is bettertea tree oil and Vitamin e oil really help
6641 2018-01-10 13:54:44 Have I missed something 
6642 2018-01-10 13:54:22 Irrelevant. I saw oil platforms off the coast of California, easily, before they were banned. Different state, different time.
6643 2018-01-10 13:54:16 
6644 2018-01-10 13:54:04 Wondering at the mentality of ppl that vote #Republican risking the water they drink & the land they live on from off-shore drilling, oil spills, leeching & undisclosed chemicals used in fracking/mining

Because they want to stop a rape victim they never met f/having an abortion

6649 2018-01-10 13:53:53 If gallantry is a crime than any man who eats asparagus prepared with butter even though he prefers it with oil and salt will be a criminal, even if designs fabulous dresses. Is that the world we want to live in? Asking for an imaginary friend.

6651 2018-01-10 13:53:48 I use coconut oil every day to take off my mascara and eye shadow, then cleanse with my normal face wash. I use it as well for oil pulling for my oral health. I also use it to cook with, but very minimal. I try to avoid as much oil of any kind that I can. Its good to have on hand
6652 2018-01-10 13:53:42 Dah benda ni oil, memang la ingredients dia oil   Macam argan oil, marula oil, rosehip oil, of course ingredient dia oil 
6653 2018-01-10 13:53:37 Many Senators spoke on Capitol Hill yesterday against off shore oil drilling.
6654 2018-01-10 13:53:32 I really want fried food but I know it's so unhealthyyy and so much oil but like mmmmm
6655 2018-01-10 13:53:26 Longer term oil is a dead duck. Electric power and efficiency will continue to eat away at per capita demand. Meanwhile, technology makes supply cheaper and cheaper. Its all about the Curve

6660 2018-01-10 13:53:04 Could it be that trump doesnt want tar balls washing up on the beach and oil slicks staining the waterline on boats at Palm Beach Florida (a barrier island), where his hotel Mar-a-lago is.
6661 2018-01-10 13:53:01 Oil and vinegar?
6662 2018-01-10 13:52:44 @SenatorIsakson Senator: Are you going to make Georgia take all the oil platforms that Florida won't? If you're in favor of home rule, why not take the side of the majority of Georgia citizens? Tell the President and foreign petroleum companies to keep it where the sun don't...
6663 2018-01-10 13:52:43 true , but also consider things like being a net oil importer ,doesn't help the deficit with oil prices rising ,
6664 2018-01-10 13:52:40 i might let him go w/me to get an oil change , but I’ll go to dekalb farmers market & drop him off to daycare while i do that.
6665 2018-01-10 13:52:36 and how will the huge oil tankers coming from Alaska be able to maneuver into CA ports if they have to dodge oil platforms? what abt offshore quakes?

I never had this problem at Yonge/college store. Sorry Currys; I won't be back. Waste of time and ttc fare.

6671 2018-01-10 13:51:42 Tullow Oil has concluded the recent oil exploration and appraisal of drilling in the South Lokichar Basin as part of its plan to increase production of the hydrocarbon by the end of March this year.
6672 2018-01-10 13:51:26 The original Timberline oil painting is gorgeous btw!
6673 2018-01-10 13:51:13 What if Waco or Oklahoma City had happened under President Bush, Sr.? What if the Gulf oil spill happened under President McCain?

6677 2018-01-10 13:50:56 It’s doesn’t have to be scary! As long as you have everything backed up, you’re all set. In my experience, doing a completely fresh install of Mac OS every couple of years keeps things running buttery smooth. It’s kind of like an oil change for the computer.
6678 2018-01-10 13:50:47 This is BS! All the coastal states heavily rely on tourism you idiot! Exempting FL is political and the entire offshore drilling scam is to further enrich the oil companies just like not continuing the tax to benefits spill cleanup.
6679 2018-01-10 13:50:41 So let's just say trump knows oil drilling off shore is not good for Florida then it's not good for the rest of the coast lines . Stop it now !
6680 2018-01-10 13:50:38 Since every coastal state except Georgia & Maine appear to have registered objections to your dastardly plan to permit offshore oil drilling in any US coastal waters, will you cancel your #Koch brothers-inspired give-away to the oil industry? @ENERGY @Interior @NRDC @nature_org

Have you thought about clearing do you  you have 
 have have too much oil in your brains which immense dampness and slow motion in energy ?
Have you thought about running a kilometre everyday ,dieting and doing fast vigerous exercise .
6682 2018-01-10 13:50:12 YOU paid off your house and car. Oil companies paid you for your work just like any other employer would have.
6683 2018-01-10 13:50:09 good news!  Your lovely ocean view from Mar-A-Lago won't be spoiled by oil rigs! Totally a coincidence that Zinke removed Fla. from the list!
6684 2018-01-10 13:50:02 Here before @precisionautot is even open. Paws Crossed Shania can get an oil change this morning  – bij Precision tune auto care
6685 2018-01-10 13:49:58 I think it’s honestly a case by case thing though. Like Bahi Cosmetics used to be cheap it was $12 for a facial oil. As there business grew there prices increased and now it’s $38 for the medium sized oil. But they have a good reputation so people aren’t afraid of a bad ROI
6686 2018-01-10 13:49:40 @Ford charges $774.00 for an oil change and alignment for their recommended service.  Use local shops #patriot #scheme #nomore @Independent

6688 2018-01-10 13:49:32 Trump backing off oil drilling along Florida coast but no where else because HIS property is in Florida is one of the many asshole selfish things his presidency is all about.

6693 2018-01-10 13:49:03 You should share the first startup! How are they delivered from the factory? Empty of oil or ready to go?
6694 2018-01-10 13:48:50 MT "oil drilling off the #Florida coast" #Mar_a_lago is protected from loss of value due to environmental pollution

6696 2018-01-10 13:48:42 The issue is that this was tried... E.g. Iran-China tried to settle trade in oil/goods/projects but failed, not enough gadgets to sell settle...

6706 2018-01-10 13:47:23 Chavez did something truly groundbreaking—he nationalized Venezuela’s oil, and Jez hasn’t had a chance to do anything like that yet.

Chavez and his revolution had received seemingly infinite bad press (and even a US-backed coup) because of this.
6707 2018-01-10 13:47:17 ... Deutschland es ist ganz schwer. Manchmal wenn ich mit Bahn oder Bus unterwegs bin, Leute machen Spaß indem sie sagen etwas mit  Allah usw. Das ist sehr peinlich und nervig. Ich denke, viele Menschen hier sind religiös ungebildet.
6708 2018-01-10 13:47:15 More oil
6709 2018-01-10 13:47:14 I’m confident, more cash invested now. The next RNS has to be good news  if there was no oil the well would have been abandoned 2 months ago.  Good luck UKOGers!

6722 2018-01-10 13:45:54 It's about time they deregulated the oil sector. It's obvious capping petrol at N145 can't be sustainable.

6727 2018-01-10 13:45:14 Bit to much oil there 
6728 2018-01-10 13:44:56 Maryland residents DO NOT want offshore drilling either. Hundreds of thousands of people visit our shorelines each year. We have Chesapeake Bay. Oil spill would be catastrophic.

6740 2018-01-10 13:43:31 None that I know of. Even our worst enemies are perfectly willing to sell us oil at the world price.

How much coal is burned to power the Chinese plants making most of our solar panels & storage battery cells? Is that figured into the environmental benefits?

6746 2018-01-10 13:42:36 Shah was granted special access by the US as a key ally in the Cold War, remember the listening bases he authorized the snoops to have, US paid for oil mostly in Arms Deals like India and USSR did.
6747 2018-01-10 13:42:34 Realist shit I ever read: “People pray for the cake. Then God gives them the batter, eggs, oil, icing, a pan, an oven, they get get frustrated and leave the kitchen.” Let that sink. Sometimes you have everything right in front of you, but how bad do you want it ?
6748 2018-01-10 13:42:34 I barely use it. But curries do taste better baked in this coconut oil. And as far as understand nothing is proven yet. Neither positive nor negative effects. This article has found no bad cholesterol either. So I don't know 
6749 2018-01-10 13:42:24 It started when KSA king Fahd had hearattacks in 97, Abdullah dealt with Europeans and EURO was speeder up launched at end of 1999. KSA, Iraq, Iran studies switch to Euro for oil settlement but that was postponed and only Iraq went on.
6750 2018-01-10 13:41:52 No, true, far too much still depends on oil and I’m aware of that. May I ask: what are YOU doing? Only criticizing?
6751 2018-01-10 13:41:33 But, by all means, consider to refer to her as a spiritual advisor instead of a charlatan, snake oil saleslady, crook or God-invoking extortionist.
6752 2018-01-10 13:41:29 The right’s Libertarians confused by anarchy- They reside pretty close on the political spectrum and naturally confuse each other regularly. 

The left’s people start demanding more from their government, they are a nice antecedent.

And Putin + oil oligarchy and rinse, repeat.

6758 2018-01-10 13:41:15 Exfoliate, use oil. It doesn’t really matter what oil. You can get cheap black castor oil from Sally’s , coconut oil. If you do use coconut oil I’d be weary about getting it on your skin, I’m acneic and it clogs pores super easily.

6760 2018-01-10 13:41:11 Don't know why people are upset over the pay discrepancy between Mark Wahlberg and Michelle Williams for the reshoot if he negotiated his payment and she didn't. Happens in business all the time and is not necessarily gender related. The squeaky wheel gets the oil.

6797 2018-01-10 13:38:04 Getting an oil change with a baby is a sick joke.
6798 2018-01-10 13:37:52 I hope so. I am a new Florida resident. And, we do have beautiful beaches. That, have been negatively affected by oil spills in the Gulf before. One time being a red state , and Winter White House, helped.
6799 2018-01-10 13:37:37 It looks like Trump is playing Putin's book, of annexing more eastern european states, and link their Gasprom oil pipe line through eastern europe.
6800 2018-01-10 13:37:27 If Indy XI cannot secure Lucas Oil, wonder if we end up back at The Mike or maybe try to play at a high school field somewhere. Crispus Attucks is downtown, but the bleachers prob hold 500 people. V few other options. Arsenal Tech? Slim pickings
6801 2018-01-10 13:37:22 Hey! Californians love our beautiful coastline, too! We also have tourism that depends on no filthy oil spills. We also have animals and habitats that deserve to be protected. Protect every single centimeter of the US coastline. That is your job.

6806 2018-01-10 13:37:03 $50 for an oil change what the hell
6807 2018-01-10 13:37:02 Tax billion trillions more in corporate welfare.  Welfare to corporate welfare queens is trillions a year - more than is spent on military, Social Security each year.  Banks, Cable oligopolies, oil, coal, prescription drugs, etc.  IMF externalities on net.

6811 2018-01-10 13:36:45 You are a special kind of simpering idiot, aren't you? So, the rest of the country will be supporting the oil energy industry while it does a slow crawl to its well-deserved demise.
6812 2018-01-10 13:36:26 Im so bullish on oil, look at that monthly chart. Dont mean i cant short it for a few dollars tho.
6813 2018-01-10 13:36:26 Zinke is a disgrace period. Wholly owned by hydrocarbon industry and a fuckin political HACK for GOP. Also owned by big oil.

6816 2018-01-10 13:36:07 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.

6820 2018-01-10 13:35:17 yeah, you could use a product then like an HA or squalene that delivers moisture below the surface, then. or try using hydrator oils and oil cleansers? they are much better at penetrating the skin than just a cream moisturizer
6821 2018-01-10 13:35:10 Jojoba oil, castor oil, and shea butter have worked miracles in my hair

6824 2018-01-10 13:34:50 The paycut remark, indicating he's happy to take cut to do this job implies he knew the detail of the re-shuffle before Christmas, when he left his oil company. Is that likely?

6826 2018-01-10 13:34:32 So far the only benefit I’m seeing in taking flax oil is that I’m getting even with my dogs by out farting them.

6827 2018-01-10 13:34:26 Not to mention the environmental damage fossil fuels do. Doubling down on oil production is moronic policy.

6835 2018-01-10 13:33:46 True.
But to be fair, the oil wasn't too bad.
I just didn't feel the dab hit because we had already vaped 12 strains of lovely weed!
We were already camed!
I've never forgotten that day.
Thank you for it.

6836 2018-01-10 13:33:45 I bought glycerine soap with tea tree oil, they all vanished in a week or so from my body.
6837 2018-01-10 13:33:41 my firsts never leave.  my first time on an off day at cafe listening to apop watching artist paint oil on a coffee table

6845 2018-01-10 13:32:56 My homemade ''cootch hootch'' (coconut and tea tree oil) seems to finally be doing the trick. The fire is slowly being contained. Thank goodness!
6846 2018-01-10 13:32:51 Me too, Virginia is our home.  I don't want to look at oil rigs.

6849 2018-01-10 13:32:27 Need an oil change and went on Groupon to see a coupon.
6850 2018-01-10 13:32:24 Public can’t afford to endlessly subsidize inefficiency. Oil&gas “tax breaks” are simply writing off the costs of doing business, like every industry does.
6851 2018-01-10 13:32:16 She was WO for the NUS for whole of UK then straight into TV, then political fulltimer, US state dept and head of comms for oil and gas firms. No idea about where she grew up but if you think that's a working class background then sorry but bollocks, she's never had a normal job

6862 2018-01-10 13:30:50 So we cut back the tax that finances oil cleanups, open up volatile areas to oil regulations and repeal the rules that prevent oil blowouts to begin with.
You are a fraud.
6863 2018-01-10 13:30:48 paid for a oil change with cash then realized I had gift cards  I am cancelled
6864 2018-01-10 13:30:45 It is a combination of factors that should worry 'petrolheads':  CASE plus China. 
Perception of unsustainable oil profits would dry large capital investments in exploration, production and refining. Long before Level 5 is reached.
6865 2018-01-10 13:30:44 I religiously track my macros as part of my ketogenic lifestyle. No, I do not eat bacon all the time. My approach has been high protein, low carb and healthy fats (avocado, coconut oil, etc.) and lots of strength training.
6866 2018-01-10 13:30:37 Exact opposite. First cleanse is with an oil cleanser & second with a flaming cleanser.  It’s fantastic

6872 2018-01-10 13:29:54 Duh. Snowflakes never remember history that is right in their face. They all forget that Obama ordered leaflets to be dropped warning ISIS convoys stealing Syrian & Iraqi oil that the Russian air strikes were on their way to stop them from entering Turkey to sell the oil.
6873 2018-01-10 13:29:53 I think it needs oil derricks on each and every hole... The drilling has already begun for them. 
6874 2018-01-10 13:29:52 Let it be said again.  Trump is a pathological liar and snake oil salesman at the helm of this great country and it's an absolute travesty.  How the hell did this happen?
6875 2018-01-10 13:29:38 Protect CA from oil spills We need to go Green & be FIRST COUNTRY TO be free of oil Other countries are getting close We dont want want other countries to beat us Electric cars are being used IN  GREAT numbers in Europe & Solar also Lets NOT FALL BEHIND & dont ruin oceans

6889 2018-01-10 13:28:03 If you throw a little fat in there (butter or oil are best), and some spices (thyme, or rosemary, or garlic)... 
6890 2018-01-10 13:28:00 How about just stopping this farce? I guess you won’t get to line your pockets with big oil money that way. You are repulsive.

6892 2018-01-10 13:27:53 Scent : varies. Some bau sedap (chocolate), some tak bau apa apa

A lil bit on the drying side. Better pakai lipbalm dulu.

Waterproof, smudgeproof.

Kena tanggalkan guna cleansing oil. Micellar water isn't enough.

OK lipstick, not great but not bad either.

6905 2018-01-10 13:26:00 I live in New Orleans. The rat bastard eliminated regulations and penalties for oil spills. We will never recover from BP. Cancer incidents have tripled. If the oil doesn’t kill us all, the dispersants certainly will.

6913 2018-01-10 13:24:35 I only use the milk.... Baking I use vegetable oil. Or sometimes ghee depending on dish. I looked into this coconut oil also. The saturated fats are proven risks, the cholesterol positive side is not really established yet. So I am careful for now.
6914 2018-01-10 13:24:19 I’ve just had an e mail from the Nigerian Oil minister accusing you of muscling in on his action...
6915 2018-01-10 13:24:15 Why the oilprepared by melting animal flesh is stillavailable in Hyd? Why not stringent action against the criminals preparing it! Why not use drones to identify the places or satellite images as the oil is playing with lives of people?
6916 2018-01-10 13:24:14 This is about stopping @MMFlint who was determined to plant an oil rig in front of Mar a Lago in protest, this has nothing to red or blue. This is NIMBY, wreck the rest of the coast, just not mine

6919 2018-01-10 13:24:07 Big oil with their big oil leaks doesn't give a crap about the reefs. Countless industries pumping toxins in the rivers. Noone cares as long as they have their profits. Why should they when we always come to the rescue to clean up their messes and they suffer no consequences?
6920 2018-01-10 13:23:55 Of course, I thought rewarding Fla Repubs was why the exemption from drilling. But, I forgot about his property in Palm Beach. It could get messed up by those nasty oil derricks and potential oil spills so he exempted it for himself. That’s the Donald we know.

6922 2018-01-10 13:23:29 Indeed, there is a big mismatch between the limited number of people who were killed in the protests and the huge amount of gas and oil that is in control of the Islamic Republic.
6923 2018-01-10 13:23:27 This is about stopping @MMFlint who was determined to plant an oil rig in front of Mar a Lago in protest, this has nothing to red or blue. This is NIMBY, wreck the rest of the coast, just not mine

6934 2018-01-10 13:22:20 I have spent my entire life fighting to keep oil rigs away from our coasts. This is a political stunt orchestrated by the Trump administration to help Rick Scott who has wanted to drill off Florida's coast his entire career.@SenBillNelson
6935 2018-01-10 13:21:51 You know who needs drilling? Montana- put an oil derrick on your front lawn and then let’s talk

6940 2018-01-10 13:20:24 Venezuelem crisis is multi tiered. One reason is that the econony is linked to oil prices, which are down. When oil prices were up govt didn't always spend the revenues wisely. You can't say it's because they're Socialist.
So in your metric only Venezuela counts & Europe doesn't?
6941 2018-01-10 13:20:19 Why are we drilling for oil when it"s so cheap?? It's like we're giving it away! Some businessman

6943 2018-01-10 13:20:06 If you have naturally dry/brittle nails, use vitamin E, or jojoba oil on them. These are the only oils with molecules small enough to penetrate the nail.

6945 2018-01-10 13:20:01 Maybe we can put an oil rig AND a coal mine on Tangier Island. 

What could go wrong?
6946 2018-01-10 13:19:45 Remember BP oil spill? West coast Florida got no special treament there... it is east coast Florida Trump is protecting, but I admit, I am glad if any part of any coast is protected.
6947 2018-01-10 13:19:36 China raced to contain oil leaking from an iranian tanker stricken off its eastern coast today amid warning the burning ship could spark an environmental disaster.The Sanchi was carrying 136,000 tonnes of light crude oil when it collided with a cargo ship & erupted into flames

6957 2018-01-10 13:18:52 This also suggests Chinese authorities have a high level of confidence not only in their future ability to purchase oil for yuan, but also to establish a China-based benchmark through which they will be able to strongly influence the global USD exchange rate.

7021 2018-01-10 13:10:27 This is how idiotic the Trump oil drilling proposal is.

They agreed to exclude Florida after pressure because of tourism and threat to economy.

Ummm... Every coastal state has significant tourism revenue and economy relating to shore business. From CA, AK, and WA to NJ

7024 2018-01-10 13:10:08 It's the tech they use on oil drill ships that are out at sea for long periods of time. That's the water they use for their everyday. There are smaller units that can work for residential use I think.
7025 2018-01-10 13:09:49 You are exactly right - and this is one of the aspects my research is looking at at the moment. My big frustration in Scotland - and Aberdeen especially - is that so much talk from govt is still about 'sustaining' oil&gas, and not a managed and just transition.

7053 2018-01-10 13:06:32 @SenatorCardin is a disgusting human being. Trying to pass a bill using the Russia lie to censor Americans who criticize their government on social media, and which aims to cut off Russia's oil exports to the EU and force them to rely on US. Deep-state puppet.

7055 2018-01-10 13:06:21 Union Oil began drilling a 5th oil well on their offshore Platform A, off the coast of Santa Barbara, CA.  01/28/69, the well blew out, leaking oil & gas.  Areas of the nearby CA coastline were affected for years. This disaster led to stricter restrictions on offshore activity.
7056 2018-01-10 13:06:21 Here's an Idea... It's called "The Sunshine State". Meaning it gets a lot of sun shining on the state. How about setting up wind and wait for it... solar instead of oil. Work with Telsa to make it a green state. It will help keep the state around for years to come. #GlobalWarming
7057 2018-01-10 13:06:20 I used to have terrible dry skin. I've been using coconut oil after every shower for 3 years. Dry skin is no longer a problem. #skincare
7058 2018-01-10 13:06:09 Old man parked next to me at the gas station just bought a bottle of motor oil and poured the entire thing into his gas tank
7059 2018-01-10 13:06:08 We must recognize that the use of #combustion #engines has peaked long. #peak #combustionengine #oil #gas #carbon #nocarbon #fracking
7060 2018-01-10 13:06:06 @realdonaldtrump Paid attention to Shanghai lately mr. President? The tanker holding 1 million gallons of oil that could explode at any minute? Plus the oil that's going into the ocean at that site? Tax Bill just cut funding $0.09 a barrel for cleanup of oil spills. Nice!
7061 2018-01-10 13:06:01 I am a Floridian but I think all States coastlines should be protected.  No state should have to go thru another oil spill!   It is heartbreaking!  Truly devastating! #NoDrilling

7063 2018-01-10 13:05:37 and solar provides more jobs than oil/gas/coal combined.  the GOP bought  and paid for by big oil. and americas environment and workforce are paying for it. gop sucks
7064 2018-01-10 13:05:36 Dude you're a paid hack for the oil industry and are secretly in love with @RepComstock so you're hardly objective

7077 2018-01-10 13:04:16 Nancy Pelosi is sort of right, but by total accident of course.  Actually, oil is not a fossil fuel.  It comes up from the mantle of the earth, which means it's not from fossils.
7078 2018-01-10 13:04:08 おつぉいる！
7079 2018-01-10 13:03:56 As a Floridian, it’s a small bit of good news. Offshore drilling + hurricanes = oil spills, and the hurricanes are only going to get worse. Please save California without re-endangering Florida.

7083 2018-01-10 13:03:35 So, Zinke, are you going to give the same deference to the voices of Californians and leave the California coastline alone, or will you still allow it to be ravaged by your oil drilling donors because it is a blue state?

7087 2018-01-10 13:03:08 @hughhewitt @Radioblogger I think one reason Dow futures down so much is because I saw oil futures up 1 % - fear of rising gas prices -just a guess by me
7088 2018-01-10 13:03:07 No, it just replicates the 19th Century oil based model that's been running since the 1890s. It doesn't bring anything new or any improvements. It just leaves economic power and control with the same group of large corporations.

7092 2018-01-10 13:02:50 Basically, anything toxic to cats or dogs, if you have an essential oil of that thing, the essential oil is going to be toxic as well.
7093 2018-01-10 13:02:40 So despite one of the worst oil spills happening in the gulf in 2010, let’s open up all the coastal areas for drilling.... after we remove regulations on drilling and clean water, etc. except Florida, because they asked... and they’re a key GOP geography for elections.

7097 2018-01-10 13:02:24 I'm one of many people who thought our presence in the #MiddleEast amounted to nothing but wars for oil. But our soldiers go where they're told, not where they want, and die just the same. Shitting on them or their families shows greater lack of character than even #HanoiJane.
7098 2018-01-10 13:02:22 I don't know why @AsoRock Cannot dedicate 5 states for massive commercial agriculture, see why non oil GDP will still be negative, better still develop business hubs in Nigeria, focus on production...

7114 2018-01-10 13:00:22 What does "trusting" Scott have to do with off shore oil? Trust him how, for what? If off shore rigs are a danger to FL'S beaches, therefore,  tourism,  then aren't they also a danger to all states?
7115 2018-01-10 13:00:08 People bash because they lead boring, insipid and rather tasteless lives. So if you are one, douse yourself with olive oil from Tuscany, Worcestershire sauce, and grill yourself to burnt perfection!

7126 2018-01-10 12:59:04 The only reason he’d suggest that is because trump personally doesn’t want his views from MaraLago ruined. Who would pay him to stay there if oil wells were in the view . California is so much more responsible  about environmentally maintaining our beautiful coast/land .
7127 2018-01-10 12:58:42 If you truly believe it’s just about seeing an oil rig off any coast, you’re even more ignorant than your posting leads on.
7128 2018-01-10 12:58:30 Could be indicative of someone who likes to melt wax into their bicycle chain instead of using oil. I use a rice cooker for that though.

7131 2018-01-10 12:57:55 If the Mexican govt wasnt so corrupt hoarding all of their oil $ their people would stay there. Instead were supposed to take on the burden!
7132 2018-01-10 12:57:42 But they probably meant to say $70 #Brent #crude #oil could spell "misery" at the fuel pump throughout 2018 (not 2017).

7135 2018-01-10 12:57:38 Well that sucks! Not all Floridians wanted that! I for one would love to have offshore drilling. We have natural gas here to drill for not OIL!!!!! So this garbage reasoning of the fear of oil spill doesn't hold water. Supplying food for drilling rigs are billion dollar industry!
7136 2018-01-10 12:57:34 Not Maine’s  @Governor_LePage though.  He’s #Zinkedink all the way.  A stupid little thing attached to a greedy thing.  They’ll be so much oil on those Maine lobsters you won’t need any butter.

 So stop riding in cars and flying in airplanes, otherwise you'll be a hypocrite...
7182 2018-01-10 12:48:59 Tough with the wrong target. North Korea is able to do what it has done because of consistent oil deliveries via China. Try getting tough with China or are you afraid?
7183 2018-01-10 12:48:42 It is a difficult one yes. Morally there’s many things that can be done. Countries that object to our arms trade can freely stop selling us the crude oil that powers our industry. The 55K workers involved can resign. Nations can stop selling us component parts.

7187 2018-01-10 12:48:06 I did see that on @Love_Lula... a bit pricey for me but I am tempted to give it a try! Interesting about the lemon oil though... seems crazy they’d combine that with SPF!

7192 2018-01-10 12:47:11 I remember mr.mukesh ambani at an event say. Data is the new oil. Wonder what mr. Nilankeni must feel like sitting on the largest oil well in the world.
7193 2018-01-10 12:47:10 All is well. Some hot oil on a paper towel started a fire in the trashcan. The smell was the same as the smoking pan, so we didn't notice it for a good 10-20 minutes. The extinguisher did its job admirably.

7201 2018-01-10 12:46:24 Somehow drilling for oil is good for Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Dubai & Qatar ( the richest country in the world, per capita).
But it is "terrible" for the US, according to the Dems. The left just wants to bring America down! That's the only logical explanation...

7210 2018-01-10 12:44:30 FL Gov. Rick Scott has been a die hard supporter of Trump & FL's Atty Gen., Pam Bondi refused to investigate the shady Trump University after Ttump gave her a $25k donation, so these backroom deals no doubt helped the decision to exempt FL from the outrageous oil drilling plan.
7211 2018-01-10 12:44:19 お、まじ！！そそそ！！
なんか全部微妙ーー、、
7212 2018-01-10 12:44:02 #followthemoney Shell Corp. already knows where the oil is off the California coast.
7213 2018-01-10 12:43:28 why does purifying cooking oil have to be this complicated i literally thought it was just putting ginger slices in there
7214 2018-01-10 12:43:28 Yeah I can understand that. But the difference is massive, I honestly don’t think a specific camera angle can do that at all. It’s not just SM there’s a lot of them nowadays. Plus, I never said Lisa was an oil painting at all???
7215 2018-01-10 12:43:25 I'm glad that Zinke banned oil drilling off Florida. Now someone should tell him that oil spills don't know state lines and that a spill off of one state will still spoil Florida's beaches.
7216 2018-01-10 12:43:16 Congrats, Oregon Republicans. You finally got your wish, oil drilling platforms obstructing everyone’s view of Haystack Rock. Love you guys!

But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face, so that it will NOT BE OBVIOUS TO OTHERS THAT YOU ARE FASTING, but ONLY to your Father, who is unseen; and your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.
7221 2018-01-10 12:42:19 2/3 I stand by my original larger point that now in the 21st century our Cllr's have allowed a oil exploration and drilling company to further their aims of extracting fossil fuels in our county. This at a time when the devastating effects of climate change are proven. Therefore
7222 2018-01-10 12:42:13 Ill give u a hint why gold is spiking. #INFLATION look at oil, lumber, copper, etc. All very bullish, hated by public. The sheep have been misdirected into the crypto bubble as the smart money buys hard assets.
7223 2018-01-10 12:42:09 Agreed we need to open the breakers on Coal and Nuclear power plants. The cold weather of this month has proven the need to re-evaluate NE ISO power supply. Dependence on dirty expensive oil during winter and summer peaks becoming the norm. > Gas pipeline capacity needed ASAP

7230 2018-01-10 12:40:58 Apparently not. We don’t want offshore oil drilling. This is the action of an addict. We need to get off the crack (petroleum), especially at the expense of our environment.
7231 2018-01-10 12:40:41 @ssvsasp @BVR1953 Electronic media is pouring oil on fire by capturing and reporting controversial statements creating hatred in the society. Probably with  ulterior motive . They shud ignore and blackout such statements

7240 2018-01-10 12:39:32 I had super oily skin and I actually started to use oils instead of moisturizer. argan oil is my fave the ordinary has a good one!! AND it's non-greasy for all skin types, also reduces sebum meaning less oil on ya skin  also use more gentle cleansers
7241 2018-01-10 12:39:29 not the worst idea; some mx lotions and creams have allergens (I can't use the ones with mineral oil)

7262 2018-01-10 12:36:44 Well Louisiana relies on its coastline for seafood and other reasons. We know for a fact what offshore drilling can do to a coastline with the horrendous oil spills over time. Why is this administration now trying to destroy others states coastlines. All except Florida. Not right

7273 2018-01-10 12:35:14 What is he most proud of?  Ending the tunnel to NYC and thus raising the cost massively? Giving that massive tax break on owed taxes to Trump? Settling that 12 billion lawsuit against Standard Oil for 200 million?  Or the bridge?
7274 2018-01-10 12:34:50 @oil_is_opium The article lacks legal substance and gravity. Given this rhetoric, why was Mumtaz Qadri's case tried in ATC and not in sessions court? Mashal Khan's case has the same bearings, it imparted fear among the society. Same for Shahzeb murder case, insecurity.

7283 2018-01-10 12:34:00 Fine abandon oil drilling in you state and coastal shores and refining oil but then quit importing gas to your state and see how your economy crumbles. It’s fine for other states to drill and bring in gas but not your state. You’re to moral to be that “crude”.
7284 2018-01-10 12:33:49 I would like to ask the question regarding the amount of crude palm oil that Kigoma can produce @zittokabwe. Probably young individuals in collaboration with you sir can invest there and supply crude oil to @moodewji

Oil State Republic of trussia. So, that would be how much for each retirement?
7297 2018-01-10 12:32:51 @SecretaryZinke All coastlines are beautiful an unique, as are prairies, canyons, forests, lakes and fields. Let’s use energy sources that leave these for our great grandchildren.  Say no to Coal, Gas, and Oil. Let our planet live.
7298 2018-01-10 12:32:44 Please tell me how “oil barons” are “squelching attempts at renewable energy like solar, wind, and water”.

Governments around the world push renewables with massive subsidies & draconian mandates. But the only way to make them economic is to drive up the price of oil&gas.
7299 2018-01-10 12:32:27 I have spent my entire life fighting to keep oil rigs away from our coasts. This is a political stunt orchestrated by the Trump administration to help Rick Scott who has wanted to drill off Florida's coast his entire career @SenBillNelson

7309 2018-01-10 12:31:44 Correct, but you are dealing with significantly longer lead times. Offshore b/e are probably below 40 bucks (see EPDs slides). FID now, it'll 24mths for shallow water first oil I think.
7310 2018-01-10 12:31:26 Not surprised, if the Dow Jones opens down 100 pts+,
Rising crude oil and higher rates. But, buying me come into play, thus Dow Jones may not have a big fall end of the day..?
7311 2018-01-10 12:31:22 Yes lightly in a shallow amount of oil 
7312 2018-01-10 12:31:22 Looks like I am not an EU citizen since my right to have an elected president and free country has been denied by a foreign country by use of force. Perhaps if we had tons of oil under the Catalan soil you will pay more attention to the Catalan Republic under occupation.

7374 2018-01-10 12:22:57 Republicans handing out favors to other Republicans.  By exempting Florida from off-shore drilling for tourist reasons, Republicans admit a threat of oil spills.  But Democrat states with high tourism get no reprieve.  Republican dirty deeds are at work.

7412 2018-01-10 12:19:05 What seems irrational in this case and suggests a near term correction makes sense if you consider that #oil is seen as a 'store of value', that will ad a premium to it. I am not bullish right now either but it can clearly go higher. It was a crowded trade at $56.

Fin del comunicado.
7417 2018-01-10 12:18:23 Zinke, drilling for domestic offshore oil is a dumb fucking plan. The crumbs of fossil fuel industry are not as important as building a new diversified clean energy portfolio that will propel our economy into the next 50-100 years. Blink twice if you can hear me.
7418 2018-01-10 12:18:20 "Local and state voice" & "trusted" leadership are obviously code for "republican" as anyone with half a brain knows California leads the nation in environmental protections & would never allow oil/gas platforms. You're pandering, plain and simple. You're shameless & disgusting.

7420 2018-01-10 12:17:41 No way Hearn would let it happen- got to get as much cash as possible- greed - oil
7421 2018-01-10 12:17:37 Refineries care about profit, so they’ll import cheaper oil than consume domestic. Domestic oil gets exported as it is cheaper than Brent. Energy independence as a policy/strategy is thrown out the window.

7470 2018-01-10 12:11:43 True.. the Oil assets being handled by overwhelmingly right wing UK governance did lead to unpreparedness for such events. Still ongoing !!

7530 2018-01-10 12:03:40 No. As I mentioned, the high electricity cost dictates that these renewable energy projects can absolutely compete on the free market. In fact, they can even compete with government subsidized fossil fuels - most people forget how much money governments already give to big oil.

7582 2018-01-10 11:54:00 My point is USA is still importing from VZ while exporting what it needn’t. Sure, VZ oil is cheaper while shale is higher quality, but energy independence is no longer a priority. What’s crazy is that sanction can be placed on VZ heads, but not on their oil.

Was Thatcher using North Sea Oil money to smash Unions which creates worklessness.

7601 2018-01-10 11:51:47 The global financial institution, World Bank will stop financing upstream oil and gas after 2019. This was said at the mini-grid action learning event held  at Abuja, Nigeria in December, 2017, this would help Countries achieve their goals towards the Paris Agreement.

7604 2018-01-10 11:51:36 Must have: face wash, toner, moist, sunscreen. Bisa ditambah first cleanser kayak micellar water atau cleansing oil sama produk exfoliate. Untuk brand ya cocok2 an sih, ga berani ngerekomendasiin. Kalo mau yg gampang dicari, pake produk lokal aja
7605 2018-01-10 11:51:28 Oil was 80 plus from 2004 onwards. Equities were flying, real estate was flying, economies were booming. All this happened after a sustained low interest rates due to SE currency crises/ IT crises in US. We are just having a repeat. Have fun. Economies will boom globally
7606 2018-01-10 11:51:19 The estimates should decrease periodically because bitcoin mining increases in difficulty over time which means less returns over time. NVM the complete instability in bitcoin value. Also actual returns that the buyer makes is hidden. Actually quite clever snake oil.

7612 2018-01-10 11:50:25 Until one has an accident and spills oil all over your marshes where oysters live, where your commercial fishing industry reproduces, where your poorest communities live. Then you’ll regret Alabama’s choices.
7613 2018-01-10 11:49:56 coconut oil really makes my hair great. maybe I should put some on my life
7614 2018-01-10 11:49:46 It's really an unexplored area of research, but hugely important one given climate data. I've been using it since about '11 for some things (Russian oil output etc) but it will become central to research in not too far future.

Actually, oil is formed from ancient plant life which was far more abundant than dinosaurs.

7649 2018-01-10 11:44:29 Yeah, good conditioner is important, a lot of products are just marketing fuzz, I would stick with organic. Argan oil does miracles

7651 2018-01-10 11:44:21 My comment was In relation mainly to the big business bully sentiment.  People need jobs, and oil products.  They are everywhere.  We need companies to provide jobs, no?
7652 2018-01-10 11:44:18 I don’t think rotting does the situation any good whatsoever. 

The whole greed argument is completely lost on me. This money gets reinvested. Always does. If you haven’t oil money it’s important to be shrewd in the transfer market.

7663 2018-01-10 11:42:07 #Iran's economy has grown by ~18% over 2 years. One reason this growth is not felt by the average people and improved their lives is that most of it is driven by large industries owned by state or semi-state orgs: oil & gas, mining, metals, petrochemicals, auto production, etc.
7664 2018-01-10 11:42:05 Yes. And if US really could afford to put an embargo on Venezuelan oil, they would have done so already. It would have been their first step, but now it won’t even be their last step. Chinese refineries are more flexible. US need to upgrade.
7665 2018-01-10 11:41:46 No thanks, I've done my teeth.
I'm talking about the people employed in and around the refinery.  Falkirk benefits massively.  We don't get a penny from oil and gas?  People in Aberdeen may disagree?

Opening up offshore drilling benefits oil companies, not the American people. If you wish to serve your donors, leave us out of it.
The American people
7686 2018-01-10 11:38:23 That’s ok, the Cubans have already started drilling there.  Let a country with no regulations or experience in Deepwater drilling do it for us.  How about we just buy our oil from Cuba so we can fund this awesome thing they call communism.

7720 2018-01-10 11:32:37 Hmmmm. Current levels of Sensex, Nifty and now oil should make policy-makers feel anxious, if not alarmed.
7721 2018-01-10 11:32:10 Here’s a question. Why can’t we invest in more green energy which is what the majority of Americans want?   Oh wait... that wouldn’t be good for your buddies who own oil fields and coal mines.  Never mind.

7731 2018-01-10 11:30:00 Compare how much it was, when Yaradua left office, and the amount that was remaining in 2014. The administration of "hero" didn't save. Instead, they squandered years of savings under OBJ and Yar'adua. During the oil boom years, all oil-producing states saved but Nigeria didn't.
7732 2018-01-10 11:29:57 Local voices matter! Let's all raise our voices. No offshore drilling for oil & gas!
7733 2018-01-10 11:29:54 あ、そうなんだ。。もともとの問題？？よくわからん
7734 2018-01-10 11:29:48 No. The tweet is just meant to highlight potential risks of licensing or pursuing offshore oil/gas activity in the area. There's no production, just exploration. I'm not at all suggesting there's any cause-and-effect or other link re the earthquake.
7735 2018-01-10 11:29:08 Oil markets are still in over supply mode despite rise in oil prices. More pumping from Shale will be negative for oil - all other measures remaining equal.

7738 2018-01-10 11:29:05 The cleanser will help remove excess oils and then toner will help rebalance the oil production. Using them in conjunction with face masks and other things is the best way

7741 2018-01-10 11:28:58 Someone in his cabinet got him to listen long enough to scribble his name on something good.  Way to go, whoever did that.  If they find oil there, however, all bets are off.

7810 2018-01-10 11:19:23 Exactly. Hell NO in NJ!! Our beaches and the communities are NOT going to have another oil company saddle us with cleanup costs for certain damages that WILL occur or another toxic sight. This mad, mad  in the WH need for greed has no bounds.

7839 2018-01-10 11:15:06 But mostly just opportunity; Japan is kind of full. Moving towards  renewable energy might help ease this tension going forward though. Less  oil and gas imports, more solar, wind, and tidal. Less nuclear, more  Tesla arrays.

It’s part of Iran’s plan B strategy.

8170 2018-01-10 10:21:39 So, using your logic, if a petroleum corporation is charged with, for example,  fraudulent claims on their 'windshield cleaning additive', then it has EVERYTHING to do with all their gasoline & oil products. So all gasoline is bad & dangerous & should not be used.

Okay...

8176 2018-01-10 10:21:02 I know what you mean, but I think the oil price will be considerably higher in 2 year than it is today - mkt is already much tighter than the institutions report
8177 2018-01-10 10:20:56 The few Oil Marketers that have defied all odds to dispense fuel at the regulated N145 price, have proven that, not all birds are of the same feather. We should consider patronizing only from them when #FuelScarcity is over.

8195 2018-01-10 10:18:11 IS CBD OIL LEGAL IN THE UK?
Yes! CBD Oil comes from hemp flowers and seeds grown legally on farms in the European Union. Hemp is legal to buy throughout the European Union. In other parts of the world the law can be less liberal. #WednesdayWisdom

Kurdish oil is already exported to Turkey, Israel and Europe. Perhaps the foreign corporations who invested to extract & refine r the ones who steal?

8355 2018-01-10 09:47:33 Calorie content is all pretty similar across the common cooking oils. What is important is the saturated fat content - Hillfarm oil contains just 6% sat fat, olive oil is at 14% and coconut oil is at 91%!
8356 2018-01-10 09:46:51 We should be more specific - George W. Bush himself from what I understand has taken to 'Oil'-Paintings and running Handicap Center. I can-not imagine how DUMB USA can be (possibly preferred choice as Team GI Joe-GI Jane).

8448 2018-01-10 09:33:18 Still can’t find real Jezebel root. A worker on insta posted her Jezebel root oil and I asked if she had any left and she linked me to a seller selling mulch. Wtf.
8449 2018-01-10 09:33:12 I’m somewhat concerned with the lower inventory of crude oil, which will result in higher fuel prices. This may wipe out the tax cut for many. What say you? I appreciate your comments. Keep posting!
8450 2018-01-10 09:33:08 Trump Administration’s call for increased offshore oil drilling is a good thing! Agree?
8451 2018-01-10 09:33:05 Americans piss on your head and say it’s raining... fund coups, psy-ops, media, commercial, financial blockades, manipulate oil prices and say “socialism doesn’t work”. Blind: socialist policies won great battles against US fascism and colonialism in Venezuela
8452 2018-01-10 09:33:00 Reduced Games Workshop slightly with a 46% profit. 
Increased my holding in CAML and PRES. 
PRES is high risk and I am hoping with the improvement in the oil price will improve profits at their oil and gas division as oil companies increase spending
8453 2018-01-10 09:31:59 Tullow Oil said its West African production exceeded expectations in 2017 by averaging 89,100 barrels of oil per day. In Europe, meanwhile, working interest gas production performed in line with expectations, with full year net production averaging 5,600 boepd
8454 2018-01-10 09:31:55 The same crude oil price increased between 2011 - 2015 but our foreign reserve went down during same period. What have you to say to that?
8455 2018-01-10 09:31:33 It's my understanding that there are 60 chemicals in the stuff...probably does just as much harm as it does good. I wouldn't smoke it...but I would use the oil if it were legalized here.

8463 2018-01-10 09:29:59 Could it be because of the newly discovered oil in Benue state that these herdsmen are so bent on evicting Benue people from their land?
8464 2018-01-10 09:29:51 I think another critical prevention method would be not sending troops into foregin countries for oil and instead focus on healing the troops that have already been scarred

8472 2018-01-10 09:28:35 The Nation’s powerful supply in 2018 should exceed that of 2017, given the budgetary allocation, improved production of crude & the high oil price. But the problem is still hanging: lack of political will, corrupt & poor implementation of power projects. We need to monitor these!

8475 2018-01-10 09:28:17 I’ll always be a fan of oil submerged rigs for OC purposes. A little messier, but better heat dissipation, complete isolation from environment, and a lot cheaper tan complex liquid cooling systems.
8476 2018-01-10 09:28:04 They don't care who they kill this fight is all about money and oil and who gets to control it get it's not about religion it's about money and power. Get It now send your money to help come on this is a joke feel sorry for everybody and give their broke and they will kill.

8493 2018-01-10 09:24:38 India will adapt renewable energy at a higher rate. Crude oil and good quality coal isn't available in India. So hopefully, India will end up going ahead of US in that domain at the very least.

9039 2018-01-10 07:44:34 Where are we supposed to pay the bribe to keep oil drilling platforms away from the coast?  I assume this is a straight up blackmail/bribe situation.

9062 2018-01-10 07:40:36 @netanyahu The regime of the Wilayat al-Faqih must be overthrown. There are significant gains in the fall of this regime. Israeli companies will invest in oil and gas to Iran. This opportunity should not be missed.
9063 2018-01-10 07:40:27 I am also concerned about opening our coastlines to oil mining. If terrorists attack those wells, our fishing ind, beaches, & wildlife will be devastated. Plenty of oil in BAAKAN and here in PA not being mined bcz they're mining gas instead.

9149 2018-01-10 07:27:52 I'd think, but since it's a sauce derived from an extract I think the extract was oil based so it ended up floating. Diluted everything down but it. Took a nip of the floating ooze and it's pure heat.

9405 2018-01-10 06:43:19 I hadn’t heard of this oil tanker crash. Glad there may be survivors but my question is this... Why is Iran in the South China Sea in the first place other than to smuggle shit in or out of North Korea?!! I thought they had some strict UN sanctions put upon them as well! 1/4

9492 2018-01-10 06:31:02 Not stupid at all. If we are to leave oil, gas and coal in the ground than we have to give up everything that is made from them. Steel and carbon fibers for example. This would put us living like our forbears did in the early 1700s.

9546 2018-01-10 06:21:01 Why isn’t POTUS Trump helping the truck drivers in the country?  They are under paid and over regulated. Latest outrage is they have to pay to park at truck stops!!!! Big oil gouging!
9547 2018-01-10 06:20:58 I just tried the oil cleansing method using essential oils that I already had (lavender & tea tree) rather than making a mix specifically for cleansing and holy shit it worked. I was wearing ten layers of makeup and it almost all came off (i blame that on my impatience though).
9548 2018-01-10 06:20:57 Could be. I don't know. But short term trend may remain strong on oil and gas demand owing to strong winter and pick up in global economy

It's not just that such a contest is possible. It's to wonder what other outcome this totally beyond parody doom spiral could yield?
9568 2018-01-10 06:18:51 I still sort of want to do a fake out sexy comic, where it starts as a sexy oil wrestling thing and then they get more and more serious about winning, until they get kicked out for spreading thumbtacks on a card table and lighting it on fire.
9569 2018-01-10 06:18:49 Whichever ones come along.  Was the whale oil industry prepared for gas lines and then electricity changing lighting?  Were steamships prepared to be supplanted by diesel?  Were buggy whip manufacturers prepared for cars?  There will be innovations. For now - status quo.
9570 2018-01-10 06:18:22 So by offering a ‘sweetener’ to not drill for oil in the Florida waters, @realDonaldTrump is actually saying that drilling in waters is a bad thing… But I’m not sure he’ll get that! #resiststupidity #floridadrilling

9590 2018-01-10 06:14:11 We may not count substituting gas for oil as reducing emissions. Are we taking credit for how newton purchases electricity?  I think the current contract requires 25% clean energy via purchasing class 1 RECs. But then, we cannot count emissions reductions twice.

9612 2018-01-10 06:09:45 Hoping each coastal state Governors demand that off-shore drilling will not be tolerated under any circumstances! If hands off no drilling is important to Florida then it's just as important to the rest of the states! Look to other energy sources and fight to break oil cartels.
9613 2018-01-10 06:09:40 Electric cars being hyped up as the end of the Oil & Gas industry is like touting Urine Therapy as an aid to Water Conservation...

9617 2018-01-10 06:09:28 If, for some reason, the vast majority of climate scientists are wrong about the human influence on climate change, the worst thing our efforts ever did was take money away from big oil. So, there's really no point to deny climate science, unless you have stake in oil.

9637 2018-01-10 06:05:54 What’s maddening is the oil we will be risking our coastlines for r not for our use. We r endangering our oceans for other people. Trump has rescinded a fund used to clean up oil spills, much needed.
9638 2018-01-10 06:05:41 In general GENIUS I think any Pacific Ocean facing coastline or any Atlantic Ocean facing coastline want to keep it beautiful and pristine! I don't want to be headed out on a cruise ship out of a Florida port and see a big oil rig drilling out at sea!
9639 2018-01-10 06:05:32 It is beyond him Sifu, all our Neighbours are taking one thing or the other “oil, gold, weapons, land, citizens, timber, wildlife smuggling, air space, water”

9688 2018-01-10 05:59:15 That sounds like the conman, @realDonaldTrump , own words. No wonder he likes Ms. White. Snake oil anyone?
9689 2018-01-10 05:58:27 While I was driving home from work on the back roads, a 90 something Chevy pickup truck pulled front of me just hauling away, I took a beep breath in, and as I smelled the smell of the truck burning a little rich on oil, (probably an oil leak )I thought to myself “man I miss...

9694 2018-01-10 05:57:35 One thing that keeps Trump awake at night is America people, whereas  democrats burn the midnight oil for Illigals and their illigal activities.
9695 2018-01-10 05:57:35 Rise in Crude oil prices and reports of increased delinquencies in home loans are dampening the sentiment towards Indian Equities. May underperform the global indices for a while.
9696 2018-01-10 05:57:20 I've never heard of cannabis oil being proven in treating depression. Seriously, get some meds that work.
9697 2018-01-10 05:57:10 @cnbcSri @dan_murphy @CNBCi Problem with theory that higher #WTI/#Brent /#Oil price always bring in more supply, not true, 1)operationally you pump what you can sell, 2)why destroy margin by oversupply, 3) add supply more likely if new players get tempted in at much higher price
9698 2018-01-10 05:57:08 I just imagined how good a bath w @lushcosmetics pink bath bomb and rose jam bubbleroon would be and oooh imagine if I added polyamorous bath oil too
9699 2018-01-10 05:56:51 nah, have to drive a slower because the oil in the roads surfaces during first rains and since we have such large gaps between rains it gets suuuper slick especially at intersections.
9700 2018-01-10 05:56:43 The California coastline is also unique and rely on tourism as an economic driver. Plus, you ain't seen nuthin' yet about the local VOICES here. We aren't going to have nasty oil spills on our beautiful beaches, you PUNK.
9701 2018-01-10 05:56:35 Food for thought:  #Trump opened up all US waters to #OffshoreDrilling ... EXCEPT #Florida.  Any guesses why?  

Remember that when your beaches are covered in #Oil, #Governors.

9707 2018-01-10 05:55:07 On Florida Trump doesn’t get credit for creating a problem then acting like it didn’t exist...Trump wants oil platforms on every beach, and doesn’t care who they leak oil on while cutting programs for cleanup to pay for tax cuts, it’s not sun tan lotion or baby oil!!!

9709 2018-01-10 05:55:00 Scott will support offshore oil drilling the second he is sworn in. We can’t let that happen!
9710 2018-01-10 05:54:53 “Oil my scalp for me” 

9711 2018-01-10 05:54:31 The Trump administration will allow disastrous oil drilling on both coasts, EXCEPT for the state where Trump owns a beach resort. The kleptocracy continues.
9712 2018-01-10 05:54:05 Keeping oil price high to aid RU govt, oh no, wait

9716 2018-01-10 05:53:14 Scott’s Senate run is now effectively confirmed. 

We can beat him. We need to. 

Scott will likely reverse on offshore oil drilling - like he did on Medicaid expansion. Vote to protect Florida’s shores!
9717 2018-01-10 05:52:54 Oil in the Earth softens the soil.  The sink holes are from being deprived of oil.  Sink holes don't happen in soil.
9718 2018-01-10 05:52:36 My mint essential oil really sets the mood  in my place  in here just smell clean and nice.

9721 2018-01-10 05:51:58 After the atrocity of the tax bill? It passed and they redacted safeguards of offshore drilling, and the tax of oil sold in the US that goes to the "slush fund" to clean up oil spills, now we have an oil tanker on verge of explosion in China sea carrying 100M gal of oil....
9722 2018-01-10 05:51:49 Good now it’s likely you will sell it off so we can drill it for oil
9723 2018-01-10 05:51:33 @lisamurkowski is this a part of the “responsible energy development plan” in the #ArcticRefuge? What will happen after the first oil spill? #KeepItInTheGround #ProtectTheArctic #allpipelinesleak

9727 2018-01-10 05:51:00 Massage a few drops of coconut oil around the eyes to get rid off dark circles.
9728 2018-01-10 05:50:40 I'm contrarian. Existing KM pipeline roughly 60% - 70% over-subscribed every month. Alaskan oil fields dwindling & WA State+coastal California refinery agglomeration require new sources. Most have cokers installed to refiner heavy oil/ bitumen. Logistically KM output preferable.
9729 2018-01-10 05:50:37 Hey Zinke, Michigan has more coastline than Florida and California on the Great Lakes & we've got an aging dangerous oil pipeline of a foreign co. threatening the largest surface freshwater in the world. We want it shut down! #NoLine5

Elon Musk: we can make it electric and carbon neutral.
Trump: Fake News.. Easy Elon is a immigrant!
9737 2018-01-10 05:49:08 Lol! Coconut oil. Apply some on ypur finger before going to bed and it should feel much better in the morning

9742 2018-01-10 05:48:46 That moment when your phone is covered in body oil xD
9743 2018-01-10 05:48:40 That is exactly where it needs to start , off shore from Mar-a-Lago . I think the black oil tar would bring more visitors to the golf course.
9744 2018-01-10 05:48:39 What would be amusing is Billy waking up with a tranny laying next to him on his next cruise.
9745 2018-01-10 05:48:39 I rub her down in oil... yaa
9746 2018-01-10 05:48:36 Recently realized I am allergic to coconut oil, meaning that I am literally allergic to trends. This was, of course, not news.

9751 2018-01-10 05:47:22 killed by the documents she released. If there had been, they'd have strung her up without even a thought of a fair trial for exposing the shitstorm that OIL was.
9752 2018-01-10 05:47:18 @realDonaldTrump You knew it was coming.  That's why you wanted Dems & Reps. at the WH to talk DACA to make it seam like you were doing a good job.  Your raping the land of our country, the oceans with oil and raping the taxpayers.

9756 2018-01-10 05:46:29 You pray for cake. God gives you batter, oil, eggs, pan & an oven. 
You get frustrated 
9757 2018-01-10 05:46:27 It’s near certain that Scott will reverse his stance on offshore oil drilling if he becomes Senator.

It’s what he did with Medicaid expansion to win re-election - dooming many to an earlier death.

Don’t be fooled again.
9758 2018-01-10 05:46:17 Yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,good luck with that,oil and water dont mix,should be an Irish solution to an Irish problem.

9770 2018-01-10 05:44:49 So does this mean you recognize the disastrous effect of oil drilling on the environment and health, but only care to protect from it those states who support Trump?

9777 2018-01-10 05:43:58 I’m going back to drowning myself in coconut oil.

9779 2018-01-10 05:43:33 Coconut oil sister it does wonders. I live in a city where it rains almost everyday and I just put a little bit on before I head out.
9780 2018-01-10 05:43:31 when a baby is born they squeeze the baby and the oil comes out… you’re welcome
9781 2018-01-10 05:43:31 The reason for that swing, btw, was because the oceans stagnated and a bunch of algae sucked up the carbon.  That algae than sank to the bottom of the ocean and turned into the oil we're currently burning.  Putting all that crap back into the air seems hazardous.
9782 2018-01-10 05:43:29 Finally in bed ... hmm which essential oil should I fall asleep to tonight??

9816 2018-01-10 05:39:27 The Santa Barbara oil spill occurred in January and February 1969 in the Santa Barbara Channel, near the city of Santa Barbara. It was the largest oil spill in United States waters at the time, and now ranks third after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon and 1989 Exxon Valdez spills

9821 2018-01-10 05:39:04 We don’t disagree!  It started here, to disaster, so oil companies moved because of push back.  Doesn’t mean it should happen anywhere!
9822 2018-01-10 05:39:04 By granting an exemption for oil drilling.
9823 2018-01-10 05:38:46 Plus, they're already experienced the damage all that oil can do...

"So... Almond or Coconut?" she—
9827 2018-01-10 05:38:22 I hope it’s not too late to answer  I’ve been oil cleansing lately using just almond oil. Really love it bc it’s gentle and has been keeping me even by fading scars and dark spots. My skin is combo/dry.

9833 2018-01-10 05:37:56 One business interest interfering with another lucky for Florida you make more money with hotels and real estate deals to launder money for Russian mob than oil.
9834 2018-01-10 05:37:56 New to politics? Psst...they don’t undo EPR unless it’s to return the donation to the lobbyist or unless it has Obama’s name on it! Your cheering and you have no idea what this means for American...explain? Drilling for oil only benefits them. What are you to gain by this?
9835 2018-01-10 05:37:56 I believe the oil and gas industry realizes a successive President would ban the practice so to begin such a phase of drilling would be a waste of money in the long run.
9836 2018-01-10 05:37:52 สาบานว่านี่หน้าหนาว ร้อนมดลูกจะละลายแล้วจ้า
9837 2018-01-10 05:37:45 It's not spicy, really, it's savory, and it's really good. If you want the recipe, I got it from the Better Homes & Gardens cookbook. But instead of 1½ cups shortening I use 1 cup butter and ⅓ cup coconut oil. Butter tastes better and oil makes the dough easier to handle.

9839 2018-01-10 05:37:39 Acrylic and oil is a lil bit expensive for some brands :') would still want to try them one day

9841 2018-01-10 05:37:25 I am water
Oil is death
And it floats to the top
In the cup of my heart

So please don’t shake my world

I care not to mix company
With death again
9842 2018-01-10 05:37:24 やめたい！！！！！！

9843 2018-01-10 05:37:23 Sounds like local voices in every coastal state in the Union needs to bombard Zinke with requests to take their state off the table for oil drilling. And if he doesn't comply with them then he is just an asshole, right?

9845 2018-01-10 05:37:10 Until our current president gets an oil rig off the coast of his golf course, and a pipeline across it, you keep future oil rigs out of the oceans!

9847 2018-01-10 05:37:10 I used shea butter instead of vegetable oil
9848 2018-01-10 05:36:49 Our lawmakers have the wrong priorities! Look into how the US subsidizes the Oil & Gas Industry, Drug Industry, etc.. Rich industries.
9849 2018-01-10 05:36:44 using MCT oil too?

9851 2018-01-10 05:36:26 Dryness! My skin is also very sensitive so it can be hard to find products that are effective yet natural/gentle. 

I use almond oil + @BurtsBees sensitive moisturizer & @ilovepacifica coconut cream for my face and coconut oil + Cetaphil everywhere else 
9852 2018-01-10 05:36:07 Each year, U.S. offshore drilling rigs are responsible for dozens of spills of crude oil, natural gas liquids, diesel and hydraulic  fluids into the environment.We cannot allow this!!
9853 2018-01-10 05:35:33 For various reasons ALL states should be removed from consideration for any new oil and gas platforms.
9854 2018-01-10 05:35:25 If one finger touches the oil, it spreads to all of the fingers.....
9855 2018-01-10 05:35:23 If I had a beard, I would totally be the kind of guy to use beard oil & conditioners & brush it out regularly
9856 2018-01-10 05:35:22 Oil increases are continuing - Brent at $69.16 this morning. The ruble is also strengthening at 56.87 v USD this morning

9859 2018-01-10 05:35:03 @KKeefer120 I remember in one pod you said you don’t recommend running synthetic in the 17/18 Honda 450. What oil do you recommend running.
9860 2018-01-10 05:34:56 We don’t want any offshore oil or gas here in California either.  Thank you for making it so easy to take us off the list. We have a lot of sun so are perfect for solar, let’s get going on that and create a JOBS in green, sustainable and not life threatening industries.
9861 2018-01-10 05:34:54 The area where drilling occurs, off Santa Barbara, has significant natural oil seepage as it is.  More drilling there would likely reduce beach fouling.
9862 2018-01-10 05:34:47 Hai na? and one would think that a platform centred around community and creators would be more humane. This reeks of a big oil company mentality dealing with an oil spill and commenting by the playbook after legal has pored over each word and comma to be safe
9863 2018-01-10 05:34:38 @pamharvestcraft  Hi pam the apple saplings are not crafting for me and the cooking oil still will not work for me for the furnance. how do i regen for it to work?

9877 2018-01-10 05:32:49 Fun Fact For Zinke: The entire coastlines of America are actually not divided by state lines, except arbitrarily. Oil spills don't obey state borders. An oil spill in Virginia or in Louisiana could effect Florida beaches. Amazing, huh?

9880 2018-01-10 05:32:10 Sea birds are attracted to offshore drilling platforms by lights, burning  ares and human food that can be scavenged. Birds are killed or injured after colliding with the structures, becoming contaminated with oil and related chemicals, and even being burned by  ares.
9881 2018-01-10 05:32:00 Brown talking out the side of her neck again. Oil companies will not spend a dime in Oregon, because they know no oil off Oregon coast.
9882 2018-01-10 05:31:38 The Orca whales are DYING OF STARVATION in the San Juan Islands. There are no fish for them to feed on. But by all means big oil please rape the planet some more to make yourselves obscenely wealthy.

9885 2018-01-10 05:30:52 I don’t think CA is perfect by any stretch, but the state is attempting to put in tougher regulations to get off oil. Encouraging hybrid or electric cars. Solar farms. My partisan take is that Red states are pandering to oil lobbies.

9896 2018-01-10 05:29:17 I’m glad you feel that way, so here’s my voice. Stay the hell away from #California , we don’t want offshore drilling threatening our ecosystem, tourism, and climate. Now, let’s see if you listen to that or to the oil companies in your pocket.

9912 2018-01-10 05:27:21 Would we actually want it though,I know it depends on what price. In 2 years almost debt free and with our exploration history and oil price where it is or possibly higher,difficult to put a price on.
9913 2018-01-10 05:27:20 Does bio oil really work?

9916 2018-01-10 05:26:37 No coastline deserves to have drilling allowed. Singling out Florida as a state this shouldn't be allowed is ridiculous in the extreme. If oil drilling of America's coastline is bad for Florida, it's a bad for every coastline in America. Why is this so fucking hard to understand?

9941 2018-01-10 05:24:23 Read it.  Now issue the same for every other state in which the governor and the people don’t want this!!  It’s clear the only people who want this are oil company execs.  Not hard to read through this BS.
9942 2018-01-10 05:24:16 He doesn't, this is just some NIMBY. Other states depend on tourism with the coastal waters being an important part of it. So can you tell me why only Florida is being removed from consideration for new oil and gas platforms?

9947 2018-01-10 05:23:50 in the third grade, i told my best friend (the same one from the fish oil story) that i was born on long island and she asked me “is long island like hawaii?” and i remember thinking it was such a stupid question that i just nodded my head and went along with it

The more i found myself falling deeply inlove with you?
9959 2018-01-10 05:22:16 Sorry for the sudden midnight rant. I am up kinda burning the midnight oil, feeling restless with a lot on my mind, and had to vent some random thoughts.
9960 2018-01-10 05:21:47 Honey, I cleaned up oil spills for a living. You need to go on an emergency response and see up close how much damage even a small spill can cause. Until then, STFU.
9961 2018-01-10 05:21:36 Yea but it didn’t really spill that much like shit people dump oil in the Earth all the time

9963 2018-01-10 05:21:02 Why didn’t you want oil drilling?  Is it ugly? Dangerous? Prone to devastating spills? Kind of argues against drilling anywhere, doesn’t it?

9986 2018-01-10 05:18:35 mas pior que no sonic mania a fase de agua é ate de boa o problema é uma que chama oil ocean
9987 2018-01-10 05:18:21 Oh no that sucks. Fish oil actually DOES help and there are studies, but jury is still out on cocos. I’m sure it does help. As someone who sells drugs in the cholesterol space i don’t want to give misleading info 
9988 2018-01-10 05:18:12 Maybe I was talking about moisturizing his beard with tea tree and castor oil beloved
9989 2018-01-10 05:18:03 Not all crypto stuff is a scam but beware block chain snake oil. See: Hooters, Kodak, etc. Companies seeing intense stock jumps just cause of announcing a blockchain product is ridiculous.
9990 2018-01-10 05:18:02 Isaiah Scroll Chapter 21 : Verse 5
They set the tables, they prepare the rugs, they eat, they drink! Rise up, you commanders, oil the shields!

9993 2018-01-10 05:17:45 Trump opens the oil and the Intelligence Chair Nunes voted for UN Ambassador Nikki Haley if you VOTE, and Geneva Conventions
9994 2018-01-10 05:17:38 Zinke opened up a can of worms when he chose to exempt one state and his reasoning applied to several. Also I don't know of any Governor who wants oil drilling off the coast of his/her state.
9995 2018-01-10 05:17:34 @SBakerMD sorry for redundancy, just heard you @joerogan, question 1 of many, do you take multi vitamin + fish oil + anything else?
9996 2018-01-10 05:17:26 You're not fooling anyone with this move dude. The only reason you signed this is because nobody wants to drill the site for oil, mine coal, build another leaky pipeline or otherwise exploit it. You don't give a shit about Dr. King. You're desperate for political good will.
9997 2018-01-10 05:16:56 I’m calling BS. He doesn’t want oil running up on Mar-a-Lago. Doesn’t care abt anyone or anywhere else. Plus, Florida’s red.
9998 2018-01-10 05:16:47 We have a separate fryer and oil for our pakoras and they are totally gluten-free :)
9999 2018-01-10 05:16:45 i use organic extra virgin coconut oil an i rub it on an it worked within like month they all blended in. coco butter is shit compared to coconut oil.
10000 2018-01-10 05:16:41 Well, there goes my idea of the “50 feet off of Mar-A-Lago’s shore” oil well”.
10001 2018-01-10 05:16:36 Yep.  Don’t want oil washing on shore at Mar-A-Lago.  Would be bad for business.
10002 2018-01-10 05:16:18 If it's only light purple, then YEW NEED to throw back a shot of MCT oil. If ur ketones aren't >2.5, you are A GLUCOSE BURNING MACHINE AND UR GETTING DIABEETUS.
10003 2018-01-10 05:16:13 Now everyone talking about Brent oil !!, If someone guess this earlier,then they also part of oil drilling stocks rally?? 
10004 2018-01-10 05:16:11 This is what a client of mine (hedge fund) told me last Monday about oil: “there's a lot of upside if people want to play global co-ordinated growth story. Reality of big inventories, fresh shale production should by rights be capping us here but flow might overwhelm”
10005 2018-01-10 05:16:06 Helps get smooth and oil free skin: Beat one egg-white until stiff w/ lemon juice. Apply on your skin for 20 mins. Rinse w/ lukewarm water.
10006 2018-01-10 05:16:06 But yeah I have high cholesterol. It’s genetic. I eat a lot of fish and try to avoid red meat. But supposedly coconut oil helps with bad cholesterol
