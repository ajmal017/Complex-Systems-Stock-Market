1 2018-08-07 23:59:42 Of course! I own shelves worth of your oils and didn’t even know y’all were on Twitter! My fav essential oil company
2 2018-08-07 23:59:37 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
3 2018-08-07 23:59:27 Our air compressor at work had a backflow of oil into the air and blew the F up.
4 2018-08-07 23:59:23 Rhode Island culture is thinking a drive to providence is a day trip where u need to pack snacks and get an oil change
5 2018-08-07 23:59:23 Oil? Is it an essential oil or do aloe plants make actual oil?

8 2018-08-07 23:59:07 OMG garlic stuffed ghost peppers roasting in the oven smell so good, the ghost just hides all that garlic and olive oil.
9 2018-08-07 23:59:05 Great John Wayne movie- "Hellfighters", based on Red Adair. For about a week in the 60s I wanted to fight oil well fires.
10 2018-08-07 23:59:03 It is not a secret. We all know he wants to sell public land to oil and mining companies. But he can’t outright say it.
11 2018-08-07 23:58:57 I'm so anxious, I'm about to deadass snort a bottle of lavender oil
12 2018-08-07 23:58:39 To me, this review paper doesn’t inspire panic in me, just dread because I seriously doubt the world will give up its oil addiction.
13 2018-08-07 23:58:35 With all of the oil currently being extracted in places like West Texas and North Dakota, why would we need to steal another nation's oil in the first place?

16 2018-08-07 23:58:07 Statistics and figures say otherwise we are the largest oil exporter in the world and in 2030 Saudi Arabia will become one of the five most economically active countries in the world
17 2018-08-07 23:58:02 Don’t worry we still have oil covers the world for thousends of years  
18 2018-08-07 23:57:56 Coconut oil turns liquid at too low of a temperature. If you're storing it in a refrigerator it would work, but it would be tough to make it work

38 2018-08-07 23:57:54 Resentment is like one of those oil fires that can never really be extinguished- they have to be capped off.
39 2018-08-07 23:57:51 Follow the Money. Simple but true. In exchange for selling arms to Saudi Arabia we buy their oil. Eastern provinces gaining at the expense of the West, again.
40 2018-08-07 23:57:47 Natural peanut butter is only healthier because it’s a workout to mix the separated oil in so your not left with a soggy, runny PBJ
41 2018-08-07 23:57:45 No shit but I have said for years that if we can pipe oil any where in the world why not pipeline water out of floaded city's like Houston and Louisiana back to the area like Cali that burning. I've said this shit for years
42 2018-08-07 23:57:38 I love robotic oil poffins~!
43 2018-08-07 23:57:36 Is it simpler for Tesla. They want to invest every cent in capital now for next car models/production lines. Short term market pressures would want to stop all that and take profit from model 3. The real game is who has the money to make this happen? Buffet? Middle East oil/gas?

50 2018-08-07 23:57:12 @MarioAndretti the first time I saw you race you were driving the STP Oil Treatment Special Andy’s turbine car ! Whistled right by us and man it was fast !
51 2018-08-07 23:57:12 いってら！楽しんで(*⁰▿⁰*)
52 2018-08-07 23:57:11 @Saverocity as an avid griller, have you ever had something that’s been marinating in lemon juice and extra virgin olive oil cause a small fire?
53 2018-08-07 23:57:06 Ans they also have to be doxxing parents of mass shooting victims for them to be harassed, peddling conspiracy theories about a Pizzeria child sex ring and selling actual snake oil to finance the whole shtick.

Doesn't happen "on the left".
54 2018-08-07 23:57:01 Got an oil change, took a nap, had McDonald’s. I’m good.
55 2018-08-07 23:56:43 The most intimate thing two men can do is share the oil dipping plate with the bread that you get at Italian restaurants.
56 2018-08-07 23:56:37 ちんげでもいいから欲しいんですよ！！(切実)
57 2018-08-07 23:56:23 What a waste of talent. This is why countries with Islamic governments will always lag behind in economic growth and standard of living - especially when the oil dries up. It is no wonder immigration from Islamic countries is one way only - outta there!
58 2018-08-07 23:56:21 doing a face mask & then smothering myself in coconut oil happy tuesday
59 2018-08-07 23:56:21 Oh no Thomas! I’m shattered... after I stole the oil I thought I’d be entertained by a whirling dervish. Or a flying carpet? Or a genie? You mean I won’t!?? 
I think Muhammad bin Salman, along with Donald Trump, is an absolute genius.
60 2018-08-07 23:56:20 2) THERE ARE POLAR BEARS ON TINY ICE FLOES STARVING TO DEATH.  SALMON ARE AT RISK AS WELL AS ALL OUR DRINKING WATER SOURCES FROM DIRTY TAR OIL SHIPPED FROM CANADA TO TEXAS IN PIPELINES BY THE KOCH BROS. 2 BE SOLD TO CHINA BY KOCHS. YOU CAN'T DRINK OIL. YOU CAN'T EAT MONEY.

62 2018-08-07 23:56:06 Disappointed. Was so sure essential oils were involved, but no one has admitted it yet. The apple cider vinegar crew are currently in the lead, but I'm sure the coconut oil brigade is still suiting up.

65 2018-08-07 23:55:57 LOL it has taken my husband years to engineer me salads that I will happily eat. There is a lot of cured meat, diced cheese, pitted olives, and crumbled hard-boiled egg in them. (Also: greens + tomatoes.) Oil+vinegar dressing that he makes. Thanks @bdekoz #browngirleatssalad

68 2018-08-07 23:55:31 While is Canada buying their oil and making these guys rich?
69 2018-08-07 23:55:31 On a different note, cooking with Olive oil is not a very pleasant experience!
70 2018-08-07 23:55:30 Does that include extra virgin olive oil?
71 2018-08-07 23:54:58 Twiggy Forrest says "You don't put the rabbits in charge the cabbage!". So why does the oil & gas industry run marine parks and The University of Western Australia? #HushMoney #Greenwashing #wapol #perthnews UWA integrity questioned

73 2018-08-07 23:54:57 Oh girl that’s your oil plug
74 2018-08-07 23:54:50 You are correct we shouldn't bother interviening in your countries backwards ideologies, but last time I checked  we are a country rich in natural resources you have oil (which we have alot of) and sand
75 2018-08-07 23:54:42 As mentioned in the article, a couple of the brands do, indeed, use algae oil :)
76 2018-08-07 23:54:31 In Shampoo and Moisturiser Ads, "Essential Oils" means that the oil gives off a distinctive scent, not that they're essential.
77 2018-08-07 23:54:28 You are very ignorant.if it has beeen crude oil nko? Or a chest of Gold? How can you deride him for demanding for payment?
78 2018-08-07 23:54:19 Snake oil
79 2018-08-07 23:54:17 Rub down with coconut oil. I think I heard that repells them
80 2018-08-07 23:54:08 As for being green - tanker traffic in the StLawrence, threat of oil spills, dead whales ... UTTER silence. And not just from the myoptic Quebecers who killed Energy East. Hello CBC - why don’t we hear you guys covering this discussion? Or is it too pro-Alta or not lefty enough?
81 2018-08-07 23:54:06 The oil leak in my CTS flows freely!
82 2018-08-07 23:53:59 Is it leaking oil? Could be your oil pan. Unless you maybe just ran it over
83 2018-08-07 23:53:55 I don’t need to be putting just toxic amounts of coconut oil in my hair but that’s not gonna stop me
84 2018-08-07 23:53:51 Red Adair and all major well control companies that could bring assets to the oil field were there. None took a victory lap, none stole Oil and none embarrassed the United effort to repair the damage.
85 2018-08-07 23:53:45 Lance is known in the oil fields as “the guy who fell asleep with a corn dog in his hand”
86 2018-08-07 23:53:40 "Yeah? So you could fuck me forever?"

The blonde teased in return, her movements quickly increasing rapidly, the oil splashing her in the face. She didn't care at all. In fact, she leaned in, flicking her tongue along the tip of his rock hard cock at vamp speed while lustful >
87 2018-08-07 23:53:38 No, just pure speculation to counter Wolfgang's talk about oil money!

Also to illustrate that there are a lot of different potential investors.
88 2018-08-07 23:53:34 It keeps their liberal port facility workers employed = continued liberal votes. Not to mention the wealthy socialist globalists who own the oil tankers. It’s economic subversion at the citizen’s expense of local industry and economy. If you owned the tankers what would you do?

95 2018-08-07 23:52:17 กราบขอโทด
96 2018-08-07 23:52:00 and again #Europe is surrendering to #Arab oil, supporting #Terrorist regime of #Iran against the #USA who saved their sorry asses in #WW2. Let's hope #Trump will remind the #EU of this shameful behaviour when they come begging!
97 2018-08-07 23:51:56 Also it will flood the oil market which will Alberta will lose money! Less transfer payment for Ontario
98 2018-08-07 23:51:37 Trump has done this to raise the price of oil for his handler Vladimir Putin, all other info on the subject is superfluous tripe.
99 2018-08-07 23:51:30 G never bought coconut oil before until today & he was confused that there was “white stuff” in it. He thought it was “expired” I was like 

“Dude, that’s the oil . It hardens up in cool temperatures. “ We got in the car & he’s fascinated by it melting.

what did I get into 
100 2018-08-07 23:51:29 A full jar of Olbas Oil has spilled beside my bed and now I can smell sounds.

102 2018-08-07 23:51:29 In the meantime, @seankheraj's book project on oil spills is bound to be fantastic. Given it's Sean, it simply can't turn out any other way...

104 2018-08-07 23:51:10 The only reason we have such a large military is b/c of all the people that profit from war. There are many places that could use our help but since they don't have oil (or something we want) we ignore them. I'd rather have healthcare & education than more bombs.
105 2018-08-07 23:51:07 Another example: Halliburton was the first drilling company to use directional drilling techniques (forget the name) which allows one drill site for multiple oil deposits. This limits ground surface disturbance.
106 2018-08-07 23:50:48 the avocado oil rippled ones in this brand are my faaaaavourite 
107 2018-08-07 23:50:29 Yup. Manipulating yuan and hiking oil & gas prices to make summer driving season more painful... the list goes on.
108 2018-08-07 23:50:18 へい、お待ち~~ッ！！
109 2018-08-07 23:50:04 Who’s bright idea was it that we paid a handful of elites trillions for oil? We should have just taken it. All those people being abused in all those backward countries would have been far better off and so would we. Bleeding heart economics obviously doesn’t work.
110 2018-08-07 23:50:00 The Saudis could jack up the price of oil accelerating EV adoption, and make money from both ends

114 2018-08-07 23:49:42 おはようございます。友達の家に遊びに行った幼稚園児（当時）の長女に「何して遊んだの？何が楽しかった？」って聞いたら「階段」と即答されたの思い出しました。今はエレベーター無しのマンション4階に住んでいて上り下りだけで死にそうと言っております(笑)
115 2018-08-07 23:49:36 Wondering if this "Canadian Shade" is a Result of Fact that Saudis are going Bankrupt? Perhaps this is why they're clamping down on Dissent. Not about Human Rights but rather Royal Family depriving their own People of a Sustainable Livelihood.
Thoughts??? Price of Oil too low
116 2018-08-07 23:49:26 Yo Royal Oil was better

131 2018-08-07 23:47:20 Those pipeline protesters need to admit the climate is changing and stop protesting pipelines so we can save the earth by getting oil off rail.
132 2018-08-07 23:47:11 Just saw an automotive repair shop with a sign out front that said, “Our oil is gluten free” lmao

136 2018-08-07 23:46:50 I’d say it’s about time to use domestic oil - the pipeline naysayers (especially Quebec)  have a conveniently blinkered view on ‘green’ anything or human rights. Neither of which crosses those minds while they cheerfully burn Venezuelan & Middle East oil. Human Rights? Wot?

139 2018-08-07 23:46:32 People like this drive me crazy. There are a ton of them that are against using marijuana and cbd oil as treatments for veterans. They'd rather they use narcotics and other big Pharma products with devastating side effects. Idiots.
140 2018-08-07 23:46:26 I got away with getting a free oil change and these bitches didn’t even wash my car for me when they always do lmao petty.
141 2018-08-07 23:46:24 my mom just asked me if i have an oil diffuser and i had to ask if she meant the weed kind or the smelly kind. 2018 ian is WILD 2011 ian would never

146 2018-08-07 23:45:30 I have meant to grab some clear coat, just never remember to haha. With this guy I'm not too worried about the washes, I want it to look slightly more worn, as the 152 didn't see much action during the war. Thinking of a nice oil dripped tarmac display for this guy :)
147 2018-08-07 23:45:24 If coconut oil is made out of coconut, and vegetable oil made out of vegetables. What is Baby oil made out of? 
148 2018-08-07 23:45:23 What a brilliant thread. Oil and the lies of the left. I used to be a sucker for them. Never again.

150 2018-08-07 23:45:22 1. Water is the new oil. 2. Canada is in good company, and on the right side. 3. Before we get too sanctimonious, there is still work for us within Canada.
151 2018-08-07 23:45:12 And John like you real deal need a hobby you putting your nose in other people business  Go change the oil in your race car or something or drive some laps
152 2018-08-07 23:45:00 Me: h- 

Girl who drinks boxed water: do you know how bad eating meat is? Vegetables are the FUTURE. I am currently injecting myself with vitamin B-12 while hitting my essential oil vape pen. Get on the wave you EARTH KILLER
153 2018-08-07 23:44:59 Tesla is the new oil!
154 2018-08-07 23:44:51 recalling too poignantly what is often mixed with motor oil to ooze dishonest into gaps between piston and cylinder wall.
155 2018-08-07 23:44:48 Leftists think capitalism is theft. If a US based company is drilling for oil somewhere in the middle east they think that is the same as stealing.

Honestly it's just easier to call the left retarded.
156 2018-08-07 23:44:44 グランパパよりビアードパパが好き・・・食べたい・・・
157 2018-08-07 23:44:39 More oil, please 
158 2018-08-07 23:44:38 Teens have been drilling holes in car batteries and mixing the contents with vodka, and chugging it through an oil funnel. Its call going "full throttle"
159 2018-08-07 23:44:27 The US only has another 15-20 years of oil left and the rate they’re extraction it now.  Canada, The US and Mexico need to start working together to protect our own first then worry about selling to rest of the world.
160 2018-08-07 23:44:23 Affordable CBD Oil News Thank you for following me!!
161 2018-08-07 23:44:15 And fucking stay out , we don't your oil....that's all your country is good for anyways
162 2018-08-07 23:44:07 津川雅彦さん、高校生のとき東京の荻窪ルミネにグランパパがテナントで入ってて視察にいらっしゃってたのか時々見かけたことがあった。時には奥さまと一緒にレストラン街にあったラーメン屋さんで遭遇することもあった。あの時代のスターはオーラが全然違ったんだよなー。お悔やみ申し上げます。
163 2018-08-07 23:43:56 Why would we steal oil when its so plentiful HERE?.....The wandering mind of the left!
164 2018-08-07 23:43:54 $CVN in #ASX waiting for big announcement today when coming out of a trading halt. The rumour mill is that it has discovered a large deposit of oil off the Western Australia coast. If confirmed get ready as it could go stratospheric. #stocks

167 2018-08-07 23:42:50 We will see it in terms of solid performance. Just look at SpaceX and I think this is what it will look like (except oil and car industry misinformation will still be noisy but just like with SpaceX the facts will simply speak for themselves).
168 2018-08-07 23:42:48 Why would any Tesla owner sell to literal Big Oil?

170 2018-08-07 23:42:46 Providing a platform for snake oil salesmen to incite people to harass the parents of murdered children isn't a valid use case for DLT.
171 2018-08-07 23:42:36 Today, Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe asked; Why not stop taking in Saudi Arabian oil and replacing it with our own resources. What do you think?
172 2018-08-07 23:42:21 Got some oil paints today, can’t wait to try something new 
173 2018-08-07 23:42:18 I figured out what Mick was quoting. OPEC has 80 percent of crude oil. Canada, The US and Russia have shale deposits and heavy oil as well as crude. So not understanding the whole picture is making him think what he does. It’s fine. Opec will run out of oil way before us.
174 2018-08-07 23:42:06 I’m a great cook, long as you don’t care about eating healthy. 

Someone said to me once, “you know you could pan fry that with coconut oil instead of butter?” 

My response was “yeah, and you could wipe your butt with a pine cone instead of TP, but it’s just not the same is it?”
175 2018-08-07 23:41:58 If the money we send them is used to fund terror and undermine our oil and gas industry, it is our business.

178 2018-08-07 23:41:26 The only way you can boycott oil is by killing yourself
179 2018-08-07 23:41:25 @CanadianPM Please move forward with the Trans Mountain Pipeline. I am appalled my new premier has reneged on a signed contract and remains intractable. We need safe transport of oil and gas, until alternate energy solutions are in place, and sound investment reputation.
180 2018-08-07 23:41:09 Lol I swear. Its on twitter I learnt that coconut oil makes skin glow.
181 2018-08-07 23:41:06 We have the bigger 100kg model with oil filled heater jacket
182 2018-08-07 23:40:56 Now thts fascinating mate. Btw the rumour of oil in biotopes was a lie. I was in one of the islands in 94 oil free.
183 2018-08-07 23:40:40 たらこって美味いよな！
184 2018-08-07 23:40:23 Need to develop a device that can be dropped in the fire to use up the oxygen. Dynamite is used to put the fire out on oil well fires. The area is deviated anyway.

He's a massive opiate and stimulant abuser.
188 2018-08-07 23:39:49 Why are you playing hard to get when you're sitting right next to me with that sweet almond oil and box of Twinkies. ;) #ChopOn
189 2018-08-07 23:39:43 Who is going to ban ICE?  Just make oil a profit center of governments and tax it like Europe.  Banning ICE anywhere before 2050 is insanity.  Govt works for people, this would be against.
190 2018-08-07 23:39:28 The squeaky tweet must get the oil because they are well lubed now, to be fair. 
The NSA must have complained.
191 2018-08-07 23:39:27 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
192 2018-08-07 23:39:25 Sonic the Hedgehog was invented by a Liberal Hippie douche back in the 60's and Dr Robotnik was invented by a Illuminati oil baron back in the 1920s.
193 2018-08-07 23:39:23 All the latest news to break into msm is weird, and suspicious. What are they getting in front of? I have msm boycott, but i've seen misinfo in excerpts. I see joke Jones v Assange, joke Rivera v Saud terrorism, soften blows, muddy Yemen, oil is gonna skyrocket...
194 2018-08-07 23:39:22 Szkoda, że ICC nie zorganizowało meczu Realu z Romą na stadionie w rodzaju Lucas Oil Stadium. Okay, pomyślałem o tym, bo jest burza, ale nadal - szkoda, architektonicznie cudowna arena.
195 2018-08-07 23:39:15 Lol my car way over due for an oil change I came last minute before they closed the lady was about to turn me away but one of the mechanics was like gone ring her up 
196 2018-08-07 23:39:03 Talk dirty to me ... Tell me how bad you wanna take my dreads out of braids n then wash my hair for me with tea tree oil shampoo

198 2018-08-07 23:38:38 Yes, it would require nationalizing the industry and that is indeed common sense for basically every other major oil exporting nation.
199 2018-08-07 23:38:37 Canada is full of racist and homeless? Prove it! Canada has the third largest OIL reserves after Saudi Arabia, who is 2nd. We also have freedom, economic strength, best education, democracy, Universal Health care, women can drive many centuries ago. So #ignorant
200 2018-08-07 23:38:35 Nope !!  He hates our oil..He hates our gas...  but more than anything...He hates the humans that live here !  THAT'S the man running this country!
201 2018-08-07 23:38:24 Need to develop a device that can be dropped in the fire to use up the oxygen. Dynamite is used to put the fire out on oil well fires. The area is deviated anyway.
202 2018-08-07 23:38:10 This is like a snake oil revival...listen to yourselves not a single negative comment...reminds me of the good old days of internet stocks in 1999.
203 2018-08-07 23:37:55 Gone change the oil on the truck. BAEs been hurting and it’s all my fault. 
204 2018-08-07 23:37:40 Alberta has the highest wages in Canada for a reason and it’s because of the oil sector.
205 2018-08-07 23:37:36 The amount of times I done get pop by this hot oil <
206 2018-08-07 23:37:17 tea tree oil for literally everything
207 2018-08-07 23:37:15 Lavender oil on your pillow will help you relax and get to sleep.
208 2018-08-07 23:37:15 Eew my hair still smells like coconut oil, I’m suffering.
209 2018-08-07 23:37:14 Backfire? Certainly not. But that's what the U.S. is trying to do. Twist the arms of China, bend its knees. Imposing tariffs & pressuring China to halt oil importation from Iran won't work. Too late! Xi has already cemented China's economic, military & political power.
210 2018-08-07 23:37:14 And there are "Angels" like him everywhere. Much love and thanks to all those who provide cannabis oil to patients in need at little to no cost, my own son being one of the fortunate recipients (stage 4 cancer). You are all Champions of Humanity.
211 2018-08-07 23:37:10 I do not like mustard. And it’s like they took bbq sauce and destroyed it by adding mustard and soybean oil. 
212 2018-08-07 23:37:06 No it's Keto look it up on Pinterest some recipes give you the macros you melt it down with coconut oil and then freeze it its not straight peanut butter
213 2018-08-07 23:37:03 No oil and vinegar on Alex, though. Perhaps that makes all the difference.
214 2018-08-07 23:37:02 Oil moneyの威力ですね
215 2018-08-07 23:36:41 Chicago-style is oil instead of vinegar, and a mix of veggies... I swear it's good
216 2018-08-07 23:36:36 The oil of honour is coming on you.
217 2018-08-07 23:36:33 The guy doing my oil change referred to my cabin filter as “this guy” like it’s a fun little character in a children’s book. Quit patronizing me and put my dusty filters back, dude. I’m not spending another dime today.
218 2018-08-07 23:36:13 Power they would use to stall the transition away from oil.
219 2018-08-07 23:36:09 Sweet! I'm the same, currently on a diet of lemons, asproclear and tea tree oil fumes
220 2018-08-07 23:35:58 2nd if it is true that west Canada have a lot of oil and you have no silly pipeline why you do not use the ship from west to east since Africa and Middle East is far away
221 2018-08-07 23:35:57 My oil comes in diamonds now. .
222 2018-08-07 23:35:53 I would cover his wind shield with glitter and olive oil!!!
223 2018-08-07 23:35:38 This is a hedged position.    The Saudis are longing oil and longing an electric carmaker as a hedge- brilliant
224 2018-08-07 23:35:34 Yeah, I had to use baby oil on his head. It didn’t work when he was a baby but it did when he was a bit older.
Oil it up, leave overnight, use a baby brush to gently remove any that wa ts to come off then wash his hair
225 2018-08-07 23:35:31 i dont mind it if it melts,it goes like concrete in the fridge, a spoonful of goodness is the same as an oil or as a solid. just gona have mine now, coconut,lime,peppermint,sunflower and
226 2018-08-07 23:35:20 One of the great things about today is the $tsla bulls can no longer act like having "big oil" investments is bad. The seem to love this idea.
227 2018-08-07 23:34:55 I'll try that, thank you!!! All I've been using is Vitamin E nail and cuticle oil, which mostly just helps them grow and not really strengthen
228 2018-08-07 23:34:44 Just started CBD oil...relaxing.  Takes away the anxiety 
229 2018-08-07 23:34:37 shut up you can't put garlic n oil on cheerios

231 2018-08-07 23:34:11 Full house 2 cars to do 2 motors to do another motor coming next week, going to be some late nights burning the midnight oil.
232 2018-08-07 23:33:54 So much oil. U.S about to invade. 
233 2018-08-07 23:33:47 Newfoundland just announced the development of a new deepsea oilfield that could produce 300m barrels of oil. At ~3.15 tonnes of CO2 per barrel, how many millions of people have to give up meat to compensate for that?
234 2018-08-07 23:33:46 We will have to make deals and the stuff they are going to ask for are not what you are currently concerned with. We need a political party that is aware of the future 40 year's from now. That party doesn't exist now. But currently we have to become oil self sufficient
235 2018-08-07 23:33:46 "Stranded Assets" is why you would short $TSLA. Big Oil tried to kill them in the stock, now they are trying a hostile takeover by building positions. Going private will lock out both strategies. Big Oil and Legacy Auto will have to compete on their merits now.
236 2018-08-07 23:33:34 Am I the only one that loves the scent of tea tree oil ?
237 2018-08-07 23:33:22 WE don't need their oil... we have oil and right now Alberta has been under utilized. I say yeah!
238 2018-08-07 23:32:59 They need the book thrown at them. I hope they go after underground fish oil capsules next.
239 2018-08-07 23:32:56 Nick, this is what I do for a living. You’re wrong. Any single organization that had 80 percent of world oil under their control would rule the world. They’d crush every other country back to the stone ages. Think about what you’re saying. It’s fucking retarded.
240 2018-08-07 23:32:24 I am surprise that Canada import oil because silly reason that you can not build pipeline but in. Saudi we are building a lot of pipeline in one year so replace your management and search for corrupted person who benefit from it
241 2018-08-07 23:32:22 We sure do...but I’m still loyal to the Oil...Canucks fans have a lot more slot more losing to do before considering a 2nd favourite team! ;)
242 2018-08-07 23:32:22 Can we work on refining oil within our country  ..since Trudeau has destroyed any possible relations with Saudi
243 2018-08-07 23:32:17 Yeah, we send our oil to the US and then buy it back because we don't have a lot of refineries here in Canada, which is the governments fault. But that wasn't my point. Canada can survive without Saudi oil as it shows in your graph Canada only imports 9% from Saudi.
244 2018-08-07 23:32:17 CBD oil sounds so tempting.. 
245 2018-08-07 23:32:12 Where did you get the oil??
246 2018-08-07 23:32:10 A Soviet Union controlled by the workers would be a hundred times better then anything from Jacobin or “Democratic Socialists.” They should honestly analyze that concept rather than tiny countries that sit on huge oil and rentier profits.

248 2018-08-07 23:31:57 The sanctions you want to imposed are due to oil not nuclear.  The original agreement was based on a nuclear agreement.
249 2018-08-07 23:31:45 Pam strutted into the club, her hips swaying in a hypnotising motion as she walked, biting down onto her bottom lip, her gaze locked onto Eric. 

She was dressed in only a tiny lace thong, cherry red, a contrast to her pale skin, the oil shiny on her breasts as the lights >
250 2018-08-07 23:31:44 Nooo sorry you got a province full of Oil red necks ..it would be years before they converted over to renewable jobs ... Provincial losses would be massive ...nice to say go to other jobs not so easy to do
251 2018-08-07 23:31:42 It’s actually jus bentonite Clay. It’s not an actual mask cause you’ll still have to add stuff like ACV or water, charcoal powder or honey even tea tee oil. ACV n the clay is the most basic mask u can whip up. Many variations exist. U can get the clay at any herbal store.
252 2018-08-07 23:31:42 Formula for success: rise early, work hard, strike oil.
253 2018-08-07 23:31:34 Part time. Which means part time pay. In a city half way across the world and very expensive to live in. Tasting a product over 57% sugar palm oil and skim milk. Hmmm. Pass.

258 2018-08-07 23:31:02 I crush them up w salmon (sometimes tuna), sea salt, olive oil and lemon juice. Makes a good snack.
259 2018-08-07 23:30:59 Canada needs to get up on renewables NOW. Ditch the oil sands. Ditch coal. The Chinese are going this direction too.
260 2018-08-07 23:30:58 If CFO/DD&A is an appropriate indicator to measure shale operators cash flow performance, I see low evidance for shale oil being unsustainable. This would somewhat support the lower for longer thesis in the long run. Tbh, I'm still unsure if shale is mall investment or not

270 2018-08-07 23:29:20 The information you have in that magazine is outdated. The current owners of the refinery have made significant investments since they purchased and are now refining offshore NL oil. I don’t have %, but they are.
271 2018-08-07 23:29:11 Yep. I think they hold their own as an individual dish though too! Cut them in half, olive oil, salt and pep, then bbq or roast!
272 2018-08-07 23:29:10 Really deal with it is what you have to say  stop trying to mix water and oil in one pot just to get a point through. For once have some emotion

274 2018-08-07 23:29:05 I don't know.  I've never seen the term antitrust broken down.  I'm also not totally sure if the "trust-busting" era was actually monopolies or oligopolies.  Like, US Steel was a real monopoly under Taft, and he wanted to break it up.  I think Standard Oil was also a monopoly.
275 2018-08-07 23:29:02 How pathetic. Confirmation that oil talks, but human rights? Forget about them. What a dark age we are in!

279 2018-08-07 23:28:52 Heralding an end to our global oil addiction — perpetrated by a few mega-rich dealers who affect domestic policy, and drive deadly climate change — does not enrich Saudi Arabia

289 2018-08-07 23:27:15 @demonologist666 I need to know what hurts demons. I no about sage, kosher salt, olive oil... 
But those aren't weapons, there more like, for warding off demons.
290 2018-08-07 23:27:14 One good thing about trade wars, maybe fewer giant cargo ships burning massive amounts of fuel oil?
291 2018-08-07 23:27:11 Fair enough. I’ll even make the popcorn. It’ll be fun to watch. Although, the plaintiff will have to prove harm to have a viable case, no? I’m guessing loss of revenue? However, Jones has his own website where he can share his thoughts and sell snake oil all he likes.
292 2018-08-07 23:27:07 Today I learned that there are people who don't like the smell of coconut oil
293 2018-08-07 23:27:02 The king of a kingdom that is propped up by oil. When the oil wells dry up, where will the kingdom be?
294 2018-08-07 23:26:59 @agrumia Love the sound of the Olive oil, I just can’t get enough of it, how good is yours then?
295 2018-08-07 23:26:56 If it was the USG deciding what was acceptable speech, I'd agree with you.  But that's not what's happening.  Alex Jones makes millions every year peddling his conspiracy theories and snake oil supplements.  He has a platform, even now, in his website, newsletter, etc.

296 2018-08-07 23:26:48 The way we are extracting the oil is a disaster. We can’t even sell it at a decent price.  There is no reason to allow this to continue.
297 2018-08-07 23:26:44 I remember my dad’s yellow Mustang. It was pretty, but leaked oil like a sieve. 
298 2018-08-07 23:26:38 If Saudi Arabia was just an ordinary country without huge amount of oil, what you say wound already have been real.
299 2018-08-07 23:26:31 coconut remains good at high temps  but the higher the temps the more the oil degrades, because coconut oil melts at 23 degrees you can infuse at very low temps so melt the oil add 3 drops of lime,mix well,job done

301 2018-08-07 23:26:10 Every time I get a oil change the nigga come back like  looks like you need a flush  so every car I bring need a flush huh
302 2018-08-07 23:25:54 Every CA Infrastructures’ materials, inclusive of the wind, solar, and EV industry, are dependent on the chemicals and by products from oil for their materials.
303 2018-08-07 23:25:42 Just like Big Oil colluding to rig and elevate the price of gas, Big Tech will be dealt with.
304 2018-08-07 23:25:32 Then we shut off the oil that is going to the states as we speak from Alberta. Key Stone pipe line.
305 2018-08-07 23:25:23 okay what saved me is: oil based cleanser, then charcoal cleanser, then witch hazel toner and then an oil moisturizer (i use olive oil but if you have oily skin use something lighter like jojoba oil)! the witch hazel toner is amazing for acne. also tea tree oil for spot treatment
306 2018-08-07 23:25:23 Keep an eye on JGB's - 20 bps on the 10 year would be enough to help treasuries test YTD highs - But 20 bps is the ceiling for JGB's IMO - a real breakout in U.S. will need some nasty inflation data - oil spike maybe? Still a no touch for me and rangebound.
307 2018-08-07 23:25:11 James5:14-15 Is anyone among you sick?Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.And the prayer of faith will save the sick,and the Lord will raise him up.And if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.

313 2018-08-07 23:24:32 1) Chavez failed to diversify the economy and chose to invest in social services which helped a lot of people, but neglected to invest in the long term economy of the country, this resulted in an economy extremely vulnerable to a crash in the value of oil.

315 2018-08-07 23:24:16 Why are dads so obsessed with checking the oil
316 2018-08-07 23:23:50 Oil price will super spike if Iran keeps to her promise of blocking the Straits of Hormuz. China will pay dearly for oil with a self devalued RMB, due to myopic unfounded Sino supremacy syndrome.
317 2018-08-07 23:23:48 Life begins when you learn how to make croutons. Gone are the days of stale bread. All you need is oil and cheese to revive, resuscitate, reveal that all of us have beauty inside. We just need to be brave enough to release it.
318 2018-08-07 23:23:47 You'll soon know. I think actually the oil filter mount on my old Nissan was slightly bent as it had to be *really* cranked on to not leak
319 2018-08-07 23:23:33 It’s a valid response if not a bit rambling.
Oil subsidies, military budget bloat. These things absolutely could@get redirected to social programs and make America better.
320 2018-08-07 23:23:33 Saudi student won’t be missed. Students from around the world are clamouring to come to Canada to learn. 
The Student issue is a non-issue. Why even mention it. The bigger problem is Saudi Tanker Oil is 11’/, of Ont & Que Oil. We must stop buying & build a pipeline, use  Oil

325 2018-08-07 23:22:50 Went to ask Anthony if he needed any help with changing the oil in his car & spilled oil all over the driveway in the first three seconds 
326 2018-08-07 23:22:44 yeah only use it in cooking, don't like olive oil taste. I just found out about the benefits of castor oil. it is more just cosmetic and medicinal. where the coconut is nutrionally better taste, feel wise.
327 2018-08-07 23:22:38 It’s caused by the draining of Lake O. Not oil.
328 2018-08-07 23:22:33 I don’t need a preferred gas station setting, but would like an “avoid this station” setting to avoid BP. Has nothing to do with the quality of gas but has everything to do with their handling of the gulf oil spill. They don’t get a dollar from me

Just saying.
334 2018-08-07 23:22:07 I hear a call for Conservative sites. IMO, while it may seem the answer to censorship, I think it only increases the probability of people being confined to living in a bubble of like mindedness.

354 2018-08-07 23:19:49 You better impose sanctions on Islamic Regime's power organizations, the IR officials and their families as you better know that a significant number of them are living in your country and at least 2 years of Iran's oil export dollars are deposited in their bank accounts.

381 2018-08-07 23:16:17 You mean the promised broad shoulders of the union before 2014 became slopy shoulders when the oil price collapsed and tens of thousands were made redundant. You pad all that tax and NI, and  Westminster went thanks sucker, you can forget about us bailing you out.

384 2018-08-07 23:16:04 coconut oil is the best oil to use internally as its got the highest saturated fat content (the healthy saturated fat) about 80 percent compared to olive oil 20 percent. this means it is a great carrier and breaks down colesterol & tastes nice

this is unacceptable
402 2018-08-07 23:14:33 that's a mistake, he tries to stop the war in the middle east between Sunni and Shia cos Shia mullahs in Iran supporting Yamani Houthis to attack Sunni Saudi like last week they attacked 2 Saudi ships carrying oil and even #IRGC confessed it was their doing.

413 2018-08-07 23:13:04 I can look it up myself, but if we're the largest EXporter of oil....why do we import it? Or do we?

416 2018-08-07 23:12:53 Not all oil is equal. Differing amounts of sulphur and other elements. Certain types of oil are more cheaply refined into say gasoline or other end products. While we have a surplus of oil it is cheaper to import certain types/qualities for the refining process.

422 2018-08-07 23:12:28 I’ve been taking a look at OANN. Not liking what Im seeing. Anyone have info on Herring? I see connections in Tx that cause pause. In that, I mean family tree...Oil  Industry. Also see connects to Bushes,& Hogg’s.. info just drops off when I hit those 2 Families. #Scrubbed? WHY?!
423 2018-08-07 23:12:25 In a generation when Saudi oil is gone they'll go back to living in tents and camel caravans because they don't produce nothing but terrorists like almost all if the 9/11 hijackers were Saudi citizens.
424 2018-08-07 23:12:25 We could probably afford to pay for all the entitlements she wants by legalizing marijuana and taxing it just as high as current legal states do. 
Cut off foreign aid to countries that express hatred for us and start using our own oil instead of terrorist funding OPEC oil.

427 2018-08-07 23:11:45 Seeing what Qatar and Saudi Arabia did with their oil money makes me wonder if Nigeria is selling coconut oil.
428 2018-08-07 23:11:42 There is oil on every continent. Why fill the ocean? #EnergyEast
429 2018-08-07 23:11:42 idk if you have oily skin but i do and my dermatologist said the witch hazel is actually not good bc it tries to dry out your skin so in turn it produces more oil
430 2018-08-07 23:11:39 3. Tea Tree Oil

use the 100% tea tree oil as a spot treatment and it works really well.
Tea Tree Oil is good for fighting bacteria. it's perfect for getting rid of pimples. I would mix the 100% tea tree oil with some water so it's not super strong when you put it on your face.
431 2018-08-07 23:11:36 Now you know that oil was slippery af 
432 2018-08-07 23:11:29 Maybe build some  more refineries, our oil industry just magnifies the idiocy of the bureaucracy controlling it. Sell it low buy it high.. 4th biggest exporter yet we are completely reliant on foreign oil.
433 2018-08-07 23:11:23 If that's your position Marco then you better chat with @potus about how global warming is real, how science is real, how weakening environmental controls is detrimental to all of us? What's next for #GOP .. oil drilling in the keys? #hypocrit #resign
434 2018-08-07 23:11:19 Big Oil knew and not only did nothing but actively spread fake science. If there is a Hell you and those you support are on the fast track.

440 2018-08-07 23:10:36 Scots £. Which will be an incredibly resilient Petrocurrency. You really ought to be worried about how much the £Eng will tank with the double hit of Brexit &  losing the oil fields. Before you even start UNCLOS has Scotland retaining a MINIMUM of 70% of the oil fields.
441 2018-08-07 23:10:24 Well oiled machine is falling apart. You used the wrong type of oil.  Lebron and Robert dinero my heroes!
442 2018-08-07 23:10:19 PDP has looted Nigerians for 16 years. Billions of dollars oil funds are unaccountable for up till today. PDP likes to chill and enjoy tax payers money. Their objectives are to steal and loot Nigerians dry. PDP are chronic thieves. Old con men repeating same circle of looting.

445 2018-08-07 23:10:09 It's really disappointing when an industry wrecks the planet for everyone, promotes climate denial (read: shuts down the real conversation), & holds annual events to plan to extract more oil & gas, despite knowing for 40 years that we can't keep doing it.

FUKUSHIMA radiation is pounding the Coast why everyone is ignoring 
And the red algae in FL from the chemical they dumped on the oil spill in the gulf
451 2018-08-07 23:09:29 You’re so completely wrong. The US and Canada are now the worlds largest exporters of oil. Russia and Africa are now pushing to pass all of opec. Within ten years opec will be meaningless.
452 2018-08-07 23:09:28 We already do that. We have not used Saudi oil in some time. Saudi, Iraqi, and Libyan oil still effects the global price. The reason it effects our politics beyond that is that we still protect Europe!

458 2018-08-07 23:08:55 Yes to Energy East. Ridiculous that eastern Canada gets oil from Middle East.

469 2018-08-07 23:07:23 My all time favorite oil!!
470 2018-08-07 23:07:20 First time I’ve ever thought a gas and oil guy was cute & he was a solid 10 
471 2018-08-07 23:07:09 The truth is that we can't compete with China, we will eliminate good paying jobs here in the oil sector and ship the so called green jobs overseas.
472 2018-08-07 23:07:00 but how about pineapple, bacon and garlic oil?

476 2018-08-07 23:06:49 I’m not sure why you are so upset with Saudi Arabia You knew who you were going to be sleeping with when you started buying their oil They haven’t changed
477 2018-08-07 23:06:45 Don't worry too much about Slavey Arabia, they won't be anyone's concern once the oil runs dry.
478 2018-08-07 23:06:43 I doubt it, that's trump talk coming out of him the whole shit hole bullshit talk. Its astonishing how some think we can not exist without cutting down our oil and gas usage in this day in age, wow!
479 2018-08-07 23:06:40 Flakes in oil
480 2018-08-07 23:06:40 Ily Queen massage your scalp with castor oil and jojoba oil mixed together twice a week and your luscious lock will be back in no time 
481 2018-08-07 23:06:21 That’s obviously due to USA sanctions   

Ironically Saudi Arabia is a far more oppressive autocratic state that gets 100% backing from the West. 

This is because war with Iran has always been for Oil & Gas and nothing to do with freedom & democracy.
482 2018-08-07 23:06:16 Looks like one of “Dr” David Wolfe’s  nutribullet snake oil fraudtein smoothies

485 2018-08-07 23:05:56 Imagine if we used our own Western oil to supply, via a pipe, Eastern Canada. We could tell the Middle East to pound sand. Two birds with one stone.  We in Alberta could never understand why CANADA supports middle Eastern economies and not our own
486 2018-08-07 23:05:52 Only a fool would preach human rights to the most oppressive cult on earth. Finally Trudeau's pretense backfired. How does risking 2,000 jobs in Ontario compare with 100.000 jobs already lost in Alberta's oil patch? Why Ontario & Quebec are the holy cows of Canada? Answer= votes.

489 2018-08-07 23:05:29 we should boycott oil.

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
491 2018-08-07 23:05:07 If the grease burns you put food in the pot, that means your oil is too hot and you need to turn it down!!
492 2018-08-07 23:05:04 He might raise a couple hundred mill like that, nowhere near the amount Pakistan needs, but it can be a  part of the mix of solutions. Personally, I think we need drastic action on imports, and ask Saudi for an oil deferred payment plan & even propose barter
493 2018-08-07 23:04:42 Canada is after the camel-jockeys' oil dollars.
494 2018-08-07 23:04:11 But you still think you have the right to impose your will and beliefs on people by way of force. ‘Only rarely we lock women in cages’ that’s your defence? 
And fines for oil spills.. how does that help the people that have their livelihoods ruined?
495 2018-08-07 23:04:05 if u have peppermint oil, that helps me too.
496 2018-08-07 23:04:05 Fat hogs do not bring as much at market as do lean porkers.  There has been a drastic drop in the use of LARD with the advent of vegetable oil.
497 2018-08-07 23:04:00 You making it worse put grease on it or put castor oil in your hair
498 2018-08-07 23:03:41 That sounds like we could save our Western Hemisphere oil for later, tho
499 2018-08-07 23:03:33 The oil sands in Alberta can run positive at 45 bucks a barrel. The Russians and the Middle East need 70+ a barrel to stay afloat. Canada would be fine. Russia would tank.
500 2018-08-07 23:03:29 The only people who come to work in Saudi Arabia are the slaves you buy with your oil.

502 2018-08-07 23:03:26 I wonder how that compares to a chemical exfoliant! Super curious and will def Google.

It dried out my skin when I came off of it, so I started producing oil in excess 
503 2018-08-07 23:03:19 fraid man more than i fraid hot cooking oil ana
504 2018-08-07 23:03:14 Yeah, that one and the salt one didn't make sense. Although I did forget the popcorn oil. 
505 2018-08-07 23:03:08 ありがとうございます
506 2018-08-07 23:02:59 There’s also the precautionary principle at work. There’s so much at risk if it is true, and a lot of steps to solve it are good in their own right (why wouldn’t we want to be less oil dependent- look who produces the oil!).
507 2018-08-07 23:02:46 To clarify:  Going solar, replacing gas vehicle with EV and oil heat with heat pumps is cost effective in the long run (as well as being the right thing to do) but there's substantial upfront cost.  Tax credits & other incentives are important but also need to provide credit.
508 2018-08-07 23:02:41 Yes of course. Oil will always be needed, I was implying that personal vehicle demand for fuel may drop in 50 years, regardless the end is nowhere near the so called predictions.
509 2018-08-07 23:02:32 Using essential oil for headaches>>>>> it works
510 2018-08-07 23:02:27 For real @MannyMua733 you're wearing @nailogical merch in your story when your cuticles need some oil plsss Cristine can give you the goods
511 2018-08-07 23:02:26 I just wish we could have a pipeline down east...then we wouldn't be as worried about Saudi Arabia's oil...
512 2018-08-07 23:02:25 Coconut oil everything
513 2018-08-07 23:02:15 There's a jar of coconut oil on a shelf in my house. I cannot remember the last time its contents were opaque. The melting point of coconut oil is Too High to Be a Comfortable Indoor Temperature.
514 2018-08-07 23:02:13 Where do you think the oil is going to come from to supply the East Coast and Quebec’s refineries now that KSA +OPEC buddies have basically shut off the taps to Canada.Iran or Venezuela,two bastions of human rights.
515 2018-08-07 23:02:08 I got Kamani hair growing sooo much I mix “blue magic or the coconut” one with the pink “baby don’t be bald” and” castor oil”every 2-3 days and every time I do it I moisturize it with water and conditioner in a spray bottle
516 2018-08-07 23:01:59 I play this game with myself when i get off work everyday.

517 2018-08-07 23:01:50 Saudi Arabia SLAPS childish Canada!

They like reading news like that 

Boy all you have is oil even grain & cotton are imported let alone cars & other shits!
518 2018-08-07 23:01:48 Imagine the US buying all their oil from Mexico and telling Texas to fuck themselves and then take billions of dollars of their taxes and giving it to Seattle. That’s what Canada does.
519 2018-08-07 23:01:47 Scrubs 

- Body 
• Mix 1/2 cup of coconut oil & 1 cup of brown sugar together and rub into skin

-Lip 
•Mix 1 tbs of organic honey, 1 tbs of organic coconut oil & 2 tbs of brown sugar together and rub into your lips
520 2018-08-07 23:01:46 Not an everyday oil...but try deep conditioning with palmnut oil, it leaves my hair really moisturized. Nutrition wise its one of the healthier oils
521 2018-08-07 23:01:41 well u do realize trump could colapse russian economy because of his words to germany about stoping the oil pipeline right. this would completely blow your theory out of water. the russian collution was when hillary paid a russian for dirt on trump for the dossier. follow truth
522 2018-08-07 23:01:41 I use a vitamin E oil on my fingernails and just massage it in on the nails and cuticle. Sometimes a couple times a day. Sally Hansen makes some.
523 2018-08-07 23:01:38 Also, are refineries out East able to handle bitumen? Or are they relying on processing sweeter/lighter products than we produce in the oil sands?

529 2018-08-07 23:01:21 Dear person that calls for dictatorship lite in Nigeria, in your heart of heart would you accept such a dictatorship led by someone from say the south east/ south south?

If he decides that Nigeria needs to be weaned of oil by force for instance, would you support?
530 2018-08-07 23:01:11 Not for most blue collar jobs. I left finance and went into oil and gas. Never been happier! Office to the field in under 3 months. Support for Trump is through the roof out here. #MAGA
531 2018-08-07 23:01:09 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, and the duty to stop it cold and she didn’t do it.

544 2018-08-07 23:00:03 i use NHR organics for my essential oils,they are expensive but quality, no pesticides used in the growing of fruits etc for internal use infusions but aroma usage a cheap oil might b ok? i prefer quality tho

548 2018-08-07 22:59:45 Media, not his primary source of income. Removing him from social media platforms doesn’t hurt his model, just slows its expansion slightly. It also inflames his base even more. 

He makes more money peddling snake oil stuff than he does with ads.
549 2018-08-07 22:59:41 Privatizing PetroCanada was a huge mistake. We can’t force oil companies from buying from where it’s cheaper.
550 2018-08-07 22:59:39 "The economic slowdown in #Russia had started itself in 2011–2012. #Russian GDP grew by 4.5 percent in 2010, 3.4 percent in 2012, and by only 1.3 percent in 2013—well before any economic sanctions against #Russia and the drop in oil prices occurred.

552 2018-08-07 22:59:26 Ever listened to an @realDonaldTrump campaign rally speech? I think, he thinks, he’s a stand up comedian. Truth is, he’s a snake oil salesmen. Don’t get sucked in. The truth is staring you in the face.

No SA oil, no NAFTA, no pipeline, & no action plan for alternatives, the current PMO has backed Canadians into a corner. Like a bully or a pillaging army: an enemy in every sense.
564 2018-08-07 22:58:20 LA traffics great mayyyne. Managed to call European wax center, health insurance, and Nissan for an oil change.
565 2018-08-07 22:58:12 Fuck Saudi Arabia anyways we don’t need their oil, the east coast would love to have that work anyways.

568 2018-08-07 22:57:47 Canada has more than enough of its own oil. Why do we buy from Saudi's?
569 2018-08-07 22:57:47 My mate at Izaguirre around 2010 when he was getting subbed on in an Old Firm because of his greasy-haired appearance due to copious amounts of hair product.

"Git tae fuck, you, ya... Fuckin'... Walkin' oil slick!"
570 2018-08-07 22:57:41 Argan oil has changed the game in regards to my skin care. Can’t go without it.
571 2018-08-07 22:57:05 All these convoluted lies only prop up official narratives and help him sell literal snake oil to his befuddled fans in the form of supplements . Pathetic
572 2018-08-07 22:57:00 KSA definitely influences oil development here in Can. We have massive oil stores, why we have not gone completely off of their tap can only be explained by external manipulation and politicking on their end. The end of the KSA would be if all the nations who had oil, used it.
573 2018-08-07 22:56:52 “...and after the chanting and dance for the gods, everyone noticed that the oil stain had actually disappeared completely.”
574 2018-08-07 22:56:41 14yo is back at cooking camp this week! Yesterday was French-themed:

577 2018-08-07 22:56:20 Is there an essential oil to help you go fuck yourself?
578 2018-08-07 22:56:15 So last night I was having some bad anxiety, and I decided to try out the CBD oil I got to help with it - I had picked up the cheapest, smallest bottle in case it was no good.

I felt much better within a few minutes, but it made my sweat smell like weed for hours afterwards :P
579 2018-08-07 22:55:56 Shot into the roof of my mouth playing paintball...#1 it hurts...#2 it’s filled with codfish oil...havnt played in 4 years
580 2018-08-07 22:55:41 Emailed minister of Health about PALMOIL and the amount of companies now using this terrible oil. The reply was a whitewash and they just don't care about the massive destruction of our forest from these MULTINATIONALS

582 2018-08-07 22:55:30 I, like the majority, understand that we need oil, that our demand for oil is still growing, and solar and wind cannot replace it. Also solar panels use a ton of toxic chemicals, wind is very unreliable and kills thousands of birds and bats etc
583 2018-08-07 22:55:29 I may need to oil my shoes they are making noises.
584 2018-08-07 22:55:27 You think Trump's deregulation of dumping waste & Hazardous chemicals into our Streams and Rivers by chemical & Gas & oil companies will be a benefit to public health?
585 2018-08-07 22:55:24 A little bit of tea tree oil mixed with dog shampoo is helpful for killing/repelling fleas. It MUST be diluted though, 10/90 ratio
586 2018-08-07 22:55:15 The Oil Kings used to play the Barbera Streissand song but replaced the chorus with different names of the scorer. It was wild.
587 2018-08-07 22:55:09 If no one wanted to buy it, contracts wouldn’t already be in place to purchase the oil this pipeline will transport. #inconvientfacts

589 2018-08-07 22:55:06 ok to eat the lime oil? Can't do with spoilng the tan. good winter moisturiser ..
590 2018-08-07 22:54:58 Maybe if we are oil independent then that helps north America
591 2018-08-07 22:54:55 Halved or sliced then baked on puff pastry with crumbled goats cheese and thyme (and olive oil) for a different lunch?
592 2018-08-07 22:54:47 From Ontario east they all get their oil from Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Africa and a small amount from the US. Not a drop from the west. The second largest oil deposit on earth. Oh, also Quebec takes 11 billion dollars a year from oil taxes from Alberta and Sask.
593 2018-08-07 22:54:45 Lots of doom and gloom, Mike. Are you looking for any solutions? Besides protesting Canadian oil?
594 2018-08-07 22:54:44 Another great reason to get off the oil tit.
595 2018-08-07 22:54:41 Deleting our oil reserves is like running down the earth’s batteries without recharging them.
596 2018-08-07 22:54:23 It’s the oil.
597 2018-08-07 22:54:21 So strange. 

Yesterday had an old guy come up to me as I was dropping a relative off at a medical center and say, "Oil!" I couldn't figure out what the heck he was talking about but then he asserted that the car was running low on oil because of how it sounded. Nope.  :)
598 2018-08-07 22:54:18 Also - I don’t care about Jones at all - but this is an interesting time where a few very powerful people can silence whomever they like - can shape public opinion.

They are private companies, but then so was Standard Oil.
599 2018-08-07 22:54:11 Oh man, you complain about "propaganda sites" and then post a graph funded by the Heartland Institute. Bankrolled by oil companies. Previously bankrolled by cigarette companies, when it funded studies about how secondhand smoke was totally safe. So credible!
600 2018-08-07 22:53:56 F Saudi Arabia, too many barbaric beliefs.   Don't need their oil, all they offer
601 2018-08-07 22:53:36 It’s what most of the “activists” are lead to believe, that we can live with out oil, oil is bad, the world will end if we don’t stop using oil... in their mind the world will be glorious without oil, split and wind can fulfill our needs, and they can ride around on unicorns
602 2018-08-07 22:53:35 Peppermint oil
603 2018-08-07 22:53:16 tea tree oil is the KEY
604 2018-08-07 22:53:12 I've had my baby oil and toilet paper out for hours now still nothing
605 2018-08-07 22:53:08 its better to eat lime oil as it reacts to the sun on the skin and needs 12 hours before you should expose your skin after application
606 2018-08-07 22:52:52 Yes!!!
607 2018-08-07 22:52:43 (it's not great: where I was (20 minute drive from Lucas Oil) it was only once/hour, bus would come sometime in the 15-minutes-before-or-after that time)
608 2018-08-07 22:52:32 So my truck is officially done for..... Its overheating too much and pushing oil back into the coolant reservoir. 
609 2018-08-07 22:52:28 Try the pillow case .. cotton absorbs the oil in your hair causing It to dry out .. my ass just too lazy to do any of that .. but try and see if It works for you .
610 2018-08-07 22:52:26 Rick Scott is an oil mans wet dream..

614 2018-08-07 22:51:44 Nope. They've been stocking it for years. Before being PM of the Lebanon Rafik Hariri was president of a company called Saudi Oger who had every royal construction contract going, including tunnelling into rock hills to turn them into oil storage facilities. (Started in 80s iirc)

There was NO NOZZLE ON IT! I have an infant son & hubby is away w the army so it's hard 4 me 2 get out 2 buy this stuff on a whim
618 2018-08-07 22:51:04 Lol Red Neck Engineering got to love it! Funny things is Paw Paw was there for an oil change not to fix this lol
619 2018-08-07 22:51:01 @Lexus Not happy bc instead of honoring a 10K complementary service, they did another 5K service so my car was with NO oil change for 18 months since we bought the car!!! When called back to @Lexus the service rep told me that it is OKAY because of the low mileage!
620 2018-08-07 22:50:58 The license plates on both vehicles are European  He’s still a gluttonous snake oil salesman.
621 2018-08-07 22:50:53 I cut too many corners in the kitchen. Really didn't occur to me that cold almond milk would solidify coconut oil...
622 2018-08-07 22:50:50 overthrow of the democratically-elected, secular government of Iran in favor of the Shah to ensure BP retained control of Iran's oil. Indeed, without US meddling, it's likely that Iran would be a positive influence on the region, and that as a whole it would be more democratic
623 2018-08-07 22:50:45 took a bath with coconut oil in it and my skin has never felt better. dear lord
624 2018-08-07 22:50:42 It is all about oil.  Discovery of oil in Iraq, and the Arab peninsula, led to the creation of small countries like Saudi, Bahrain and Kuwait with the understanding that they would not impede the free flow of oil to the west. There was no Saudi Arabia prior to 1932.
625 2018-08-07 22:50:29 'Canada needs to get off Saudi Arabia oil [9% of Canada's imported oil is from Saudi Arabia] and build Energy East' says the woman who helped Stephen Harper solidify Canada's contract with Saudi Arabia for armoured vehicles, Rachel Curran on #PnPCBC. What a hypocrite. #cdnpoli
626 2018-08-07 22:50:28 @Bill_Morneau @JustinTrudeau So now the Saudi’s not buying wheat etc from us. No problem u will subsidize the farmers. Next they won’t sell us oil which we need for Eastern Provinces because we hv no Pipeline and no refinery. For an oil producing country we r so behind.
627 2018-08-07 22:50:26 You would love to put a sanction on China but you can’t cuz we still owe them money. You’re going to go to war for Oil once again aren’t you?

635 2018-08-07 22:49:36 We should have stopped buying Saudi oil and gas after 9/11. That's where the majority of hijackers came from. We should start using our oil and gas buy Canadian!

647 2018-08-07 22:47:57 1. Use a white or light eyeliner to really make your eyes pop

2. Mix a little peppermint oil into your lip gloss to give your lips a plumping boost.

3. If you accidentally purchase a foundation that’s too dark, adding a bit of moisturizer to your mix can help lighten it.
648 2018-08-07 22:47:53 Massage a few drops of coconut oil around the eyes to get rid off dark circles.
649 2018-08-07 22:47:51 You need to check if u still have enough engine oil in ur gen most times it happens. Pls ones u check & confirm what’s wrong, it’ll be gud to share so we can learn should in case we experience d same.
650 2018-08-07 22:47:50 We should boycott products containing palm oil. I’m dismayed that Nairn’s oatcakes do.
651 2018-08-07 22:47:49 Carter was a Southern Democratic conservative. The oil crisis occurred during his presidency which affected many of his economic decisions. He was NEVER one of the 'New Dems' who tied themselves to corporate economic power. To the detriment of our nation, that was Clinton
652 2018-08-07 22:47:44 @VassyKapelos The minister should have stayed off Twitter If she has a problem with the Human rights violations it should be thru the diplomatic channels If the gov. Is that serious about it why the sale of Armoured vehicles to a country with such a bad record . OIL??????
653 2018-08-07 22:47:32 Well they have oil. Had to happen someday
654 2018-08-07 22:47:26 While people are fretting about oil, time to reduce your demand on it, and start taking the bus or biking to work. There are also great electric vehicles now too, both cars and ebikes.
655 2018-08-07 22:47:15 Well, "economic dependence", nah. KSA are the one making $1.3B in trade with Canada. The only thing we buy from them is oil which we can get elsewhere.
656 2018-08-07 22:47:12 Yeah right. The Wall Street Journal Editorial Page is a caricature of itself. It's a con rag. If anyone takes that rag seriously, I have a jar of snake oil to sell you.
657 2018-08-07 22:47:09 Lordy. That back and forth arguing between Michael Eric Dyson and Candice Owens just now on @MSNBC's #TheBeat was a mess. @AriMelber please keep in mind that you can't mix oil and water.

659 2018-08-07 22:47:05 I'd say sanction Saudi Arabia but we don't buy anything off them. They are a competitor in the oil market and don't produce tech.

664 2018-08-07 22:46:40 Told Megan the guy who changed my oil was cute so she calls the place and ask him if he’s single and tried to give him my number. Never getting my oil changed there again but at least i got a good wing woman

666 2018-08-07 22:46:30 They won't be responsible for the content as long as the government doesn't pass a law requiring them to be. All this concern trolling because a bigoted, paranoid, snake oil salesman got kicked off some major platforms is pretty tiresome.
667 2018-08-07 22:46:26 Due to ad contracts with the corporations that control our gov, mainstream media is effectively state propaganda. 

It is the war machine giving news to civilians, oil industry giving news on the climate, pharma giving news to the sick, corporations giving news to workers.
668 2018-08-07 22:46:13 Surely the Great Barrier Reef Fund name is Orwellian double speak for Bank and Oil Fund. #reefgate
669 2018-08-07 22:46:09 Murdoch won't leave trump as long as trump can help him #TakeTheOil Fox news is now just a way to a much more lucrative venture. Genie Energy found more oil in Golan Heights in Syria than all of Saudi Arabia.
You really think trump moved #JerusalemEmbassy for religion?
670 2018-08-07 22:46:07 Those Girvin linkage forks were garbage! If you weren’t rolling Judy’s (with Speed Springs and White Bros oil Cartridge) then you had no business being on the trails!
671 2018-08-07 22:45:55 Oil money from a country that still beheads people. wtf.
672 2018-08-07 22:45:53 You don’t know the first thing about the environment or environmental policy when you are on the side of big oil & Russian petroleum.
673 2018-08-07 22:45:51 Fair enough but all countries on Earth and 97% of scientists are in agreement. That is more than agree on evolution. There is no debate. Just fake info from oil companies.
674 2018-08-07 22:45:40 I've got bloody teenage zits again but I'm a few decades beyond. Bedroom will stink of   oil by the time @_SteveAB returns.
675 2018-08-07 22:45:40 Much appreciate you replying. It is always very interesting to hear what you have to say about the various oil and gas companies from time to time.
676 2018-08-07 22:45:33 Think of all the evil oil worker men that won't be roaming the countryside in Alberta. Remember that @cathmckenna was worried about oil workers effect on a community.  They might get rapey

683 2018-08-07 22:44:58 About time someone called out that vile dictatorship which is Saudi Arabia! The spread of their toxic Wahhabism must stop immediately. Women are stoned to death in Sudan..& Oil Theocratic Monarchies are not exactly setting a great example for the future of humankind
684 2018-08-07 22:44:42 The first question scientist will ask when other beings come here. Is how did they get here & what energy source did they use to get here. There goes natural gas, coal, oil & pollution.
685 2018-08-07 22:44:39 U got a problem norway oil boy??
686 2018-08-07 22:44:22 It’s 5%. Look it up. It’s on the CTV story. Besides, don’t we want Canadian oil? Saudi oil only makes up for 10% of total imported oil. And other countries will fill the void of students in one day! Canada has waiting lines a mile long for foreign students.
687 2018-08-07 22:44:09 Unproven embezzlement? Assumptions?

The funds the FG makes Yearly from all its parastatals is enough to fund the budget, you know that right? And that Is minus oil.

Did you know oil companies pay 50% tax of offshore exploration and 80% on onshore????????

Did You?
688 2018-08-07 22:44:02 Wtf, oh man, I'm behind on the fry oil technology. Just spectacular. That's why i like my wings grilled!!!
689 2018-08-07 22:43:55 Lol, you never know when you might need an excessive amount of coconut oil
690 2018-08-07 22:43:54 These people don't have respect for other countries and there cultures they believe what they do and believe is righteous but western Europe and North America's is not so this is good time to cut ties with them and not feel we have to deal with them we don't we have oil.
691 2018-08-07 22:43:52 She’s one smart cookie! Hehehehe! Yep that’s why I will NOT eat products that have palm oil!

695 2018-08-07 22:43:31 Yep, better for Canada any way you look at it.  But, we have to get oil independence from them.  It's an easy fix, if this government would just DO it!
696 2018-08-07 22:43:21 Oil fields out there...maybe?
697 2018-08-07 22:43:18 Mfs At Walmart really left fucking oil stains on my fucking car ima fight
698 2018-08-07 22:43:01 tea tree oil smells so good
699 2018-08-07 22:43:00 CBD oil keeps me and my anxiety straight, but I still like smoking weed for that more. #tfwumovetoanewcityandneedaweedman
700 2018-08-07 22:42:45 Whoa, did I hear that right? Oil & Gas investors try to buy up public shares in your electric car company, so the plan is to take it private? 

That's gangster as hell @elonmusk
701 2018-08-07 22:42:44 Gotta go with the woods in the wedge spots of my bag and the Midas trucker hat to help match my 7 handicap for this weekends scrammle...new Midas deal gets me free wiper fluid with every oil change I pay for #MyAgentNeedsARaise
702 2018-08-07 22:42:33 Trump is a money Oil hungry PIG who has no ethics and who surrounds himself with war hungry moneygrubber yes worms
703 2018-08-07 22:42:23 Dried fruit is crazy full of sugar. I've been opting for roasted pumpkin seeds. Toss them with a little sesame oil, sea salt, chili powder,and taco seasoning!
704 2018-08-07 22:42:21 I’m not walking around Hobby Lobby looking at Christmas decorations while I wait for my oil change. I’m not already planning my winter wonderland. It’s not the middle of August and 110 degrees outside.
705 2018-08-07 22:42:11 I’ll pay in blood oil
706 2018-08-07 22:42:07 Get rid of Saudi oil. Get rid of any relationship with Saudi Arabia.
707 2018-08-07 22:42:07 @MrMarcusEsquire says I’m not allowed to add olive oil to Archie’s food anymore. 
708 2018-08-07 22:42:03 Canada won’t stand up for its engineers though. Oil, gas, aerospace, renewables private investment, nuclear, etc. Message is this is a wasteland and engineers are not wanted or needed. Go to US if you want to engineer in those industries. More to be added to the list
709 2018-08-07 22:41:59 Kimberley oil has been watching NRA TV and the good old entertainment news channel, Fox News.  All while cleaning her AK 47.  Just remember to lock them away from the kiddies
710 2018-08-07 22:41:55 Negative propaganda will not end so long as the oil empires feel threatened by Tesla.
711 2018-08-07 22:41:25 Actually terrorism started with the discovery of Oil.  When Arabs started visiting West to sell their product!
712 2018-08-07 22:41:16 Canadas oil shortage will be 15 percent.Prices rise carbon tax?
713 2018-08-07 22:41:09 Ah, sweet. Thanks Oil up those drumsticks. I'll be on to you soon. 
714 2018-08-07 22:41:03 Conoco’s actions also forced PDVSA to stop shipping oil on its own vessels to terminals in the Caribbean, and then onto refineries worldwide, to avoid the risk the cargoes would be seized in international waters or foreign ports.
715 2018-08-07 22:40:58 and oil !
716 2018-08-07 22:40:58 If VIX spikes with dollar up then long oil
717 2018-08-07 22:40:50 They have this oil purification product that you dump in the fryers and recycle the oil a few times! Ahh no thanks
718 2018-08-07 22:40:39 Thank God we can get filthy oil from the Saudi's..... Oh wait...
719 2018-08-07 22:40:07 サラダ油って体に悪いんですか？サラダなのに？
720 2018-08-07 22:39:50 Look beyond the story & you may see Frank Herbert's inspiration: Afghan tribes as Freemen, Middle East oil politics as planetary intrigue. Shai-hulud is BDE; in the US, Big Rigs drive the black pavement across a continent. He who controls oil, controls our world.
721 2018-08-07 22:39:49 Who can what is it that was done by Russia in an American soil without American runing around the world cousing conflict like right now in Iran?what you will achieve you want to still oil and gas while the Iranian fighting on other side you will be drilling oil
722 2018-08-07 22:39:48 1. You are almost right. The value of your work is tied to the work you produce. The Ferrari mechanic probably makes more than the guy that changes your oil at jiffy lube. But even he doesn't get 100% of what he produces.
723 2018-08-07 22:39:33 Venezuela ranks number 1 in oil reserves. Yet they are starving due to their socialism. 

BTW Exactly the government DEMS want for America
724 2018-08-07 22:39:21 There have been articles for the last decade theat the Saudis have been looking for investments to wean their wealth away from oil. This is not surprising.
725 2018-08-07 22:39:20 $1trn goes a long way. The Saudi’s are super keen also to diversify out of oil. Again, I have no view or axes in the name but it makes sense to me if 80% of shareholders don’t sell and opt for a private company. Who knows...just observing the shorts desire to it to fail
726 2018-08-07 22:38:54 No Dawn dish detergent. High in sulfates and strip the hair of it's natural sebum alongside build up. Try a clarifying shampoo. Moroccan oil has an excellent clarifying shampoo! I'm also a salon owner and actively behind the chair.
727 2018-08-07 22:38:52 Pro-Tip Tuesday! 

If you start seeing dust and black residue gather on your gantry rods, it’s time to use our gantry care oil to clean and lubricate the rods. This will keep your printer in great condition!

728 2018-08-07 22:38:33 I’m getting an oil change at Honda and they keep moving my car and my phone keeps telling me
729 2018-08-07 22:38:31 To sell fuvking literal snake oil supplements, no less. But I honestly think there is a dark agenda at work
730 2018-08-07 22:38:28 Not likely... the world is more likely to switch to alternatives in 55 years which would extend any foreseeable prediction of today about running out of oil. Those planes and freighters won’t run on solar or electric but cars can and will.
731 2018-08-07 22:38:27 It’s the oil.
732 2018-08-07 22:38:21 Man synthetic oil changes are $80 with a coupon !!! KMA ! My girl said fuck it put some vegetable oil in that bitch
733 2018-08-07 22:38:19 I’m tellin you. Yo girl gon be horny as fuck. I think it’s the smell of baby oil n fried chicken
734 2018-08-07 22:38:18 XAU/CL reads like a currency pair. Can currently get 17.42 barrels of oil for every oz of gold. This can either break at this x road with maybe some risk off-ness or increase with risk on
735 2018-08-07 22:38:14 Another good tip is the used cooking oil receptacle. Just look at the trap on top, if you see burnt remnants of fried food, gives ya a good idea how often fry oil is changed, which can give you a good idea how long they try and stretch other items, ones you may eat!!!
736 2018-08-07 22:38:12 PDVSA’s problems were compounded in May when U.S. oil firm ConocoPhillips began seizing PDVSA assets in the Caribbean as payment for a $2 billion arbitration award.
737 2018-08-07 22:38:12 It’s called the price of oil.
738 2018-08-07 22:38:12 Thats right. Climate change is a crisis that will throw a monkey wrench at oil.
739 2018-08-07 22:37:58 As the real interference in UK politics hits us full on in the face, the Tory's & Blairites try to fool us with the snake oil salesman trick of Russia poisoning us  & infecting our minds with memes
740 2018-08-07 22:37:47 toast and  oil 
I'm the oil
741 2018-08-07 22:37:31 maybe you should start a facebook for republicans? oh yeah old out of touch white people and technology are like oil and water.
742 2018-08-07 22:37:18 I know Jamaican Castor oil works. You have locs?
743 2018-08-07 22:37:14 Owowow- some oil splashed onto my hand q x q
744 2018-08-07 22:37:13 Bikers, please visit the "Oil Bud" oil cooler booth at the Deadwood Custom Cycles.
745 2018-08-07 22:37:11 I prefer mine fried with olive oil :P
746 2018-08-07 22:37:01 oh and salt! grabbed the olive oil pan spray, the lid flew off & the can then flew, arced. landed right on my toes.
747 2018-08-07 22:36:59 It’s kinda funny when a road gets paved watching every single persons vehicle drive by with that black oil thrown halfway up the sides of their vehicle. Looks like I’m stuck at home until it dries so that I won’t be one of those people too
748 2018-08-07 22:36:58 I’m not sure, but I do have a hankering for Kikkoman soya sauce while topping up my oil levels with STP!
749 2018-08-07 22:36:54 Facebook should be broken up like Standard Oil. One company for party invites. Another company for photos. A box under an overpass for posting.
750 2018-08-07 22:36:40 Guess I’ll try to take my baby in one day this week or next. Can’t be neglecting Ebbiev just glad I get free oil changes. But I know some other ish going on, which ain’t in the budget 
751 2018-08-07 22:36:31 Me: *applies Amla oil to hair* 

-Goes to meetings

Clients: “anyone smell that awful smell?” 

Me: “yeah man! Wow that’s bad :(“ *cries inside*
752 2018-08-07 22:36:25 Canada may be right about their human rights, but why the hypocrisy. Why does Ottawa and Quebec punish Western Canada and continue to buy “bloody” Saudi oil?
753 2018-08-07 22:36:22 Problem is they don’t have any editorial standards.  Also what a crap argument. Some of the snake oil they sell is poison, but some of it is aspirin, so let them stay!
754 2018-08-07 22:36:14 got peppermint oil to get rid of the mouse so i put it everywhere except my ass uwu
755 2018-08-07 22:36:12 The "right wing" supported Energy East pipeline while the left opposed it. Trudeau is stuck with Saudi oil like Merkel with her Russian gas.
756 2018-08-07 22:36:10 There's oil in them there deserts. That's what it's all about. Your just latest pawn in the game. #sad #StayWoke #Resist
757 2018-08-07 22:36:10 US Steel- Google got nothing but fact checking president, fake news
Republic Steel- hiring 50 workers in lorain, yay?!
BRS- nuthin
Nucor-tariff exempt
Tenaris- manufactures oil field equipment, big difference
758 2018-08-07 22:35:43 Canada is a lost cause for oil and gas. Don’t invest a penny here. Oil and gas is like aerospace, renewable industry ..all lead now by US and others. Canada has told engineers they are not wanted or needed here, so get out.
759 2018-08-07 22:35:40 Or maybe look to the future, invest some of that money into renewable energy, lots of jobs, lots of profits, doesn't destroy the planet. What would be the downside? No big oil company to bestow billions and billions of dollars upon.
760 2018-08-07 22:35:17 Is this the same state that has some of the dirtiest oil on the planet and due to the fact that they have squeezed 50 m people into one state is always in a drought? They have literally sucked up so much well water that the wells are filling with saltwater and making them useless
761 2018-08-07 22:35:11 Michelle homemade Nasal Spray. If suffer, Molds, Bacteria, need to do nasal wash..1.peppermint oil 2. TeaTree. 3.Eucalyptus
762 2018-08-07 22:35:03 Does anyone sell good oil that can drop it off to me?? Lol
763 2018-08-07 22:35:02 Does the agave and coconut oil offset the garlic and red pepper flakes?! I can’t tell if this dish is sweet or spicy or creamy or what...
764 2018-08-07 22:34:54 And BC has more oil reserves than Alberta. Most people may not know that. We have more than enough in Canada and should not be supporting terrorist groups saudi/USA
765 2018-08-07 22:34:53 Ratito de oil 
766 2018-08-07 22:34:52 How long ago was your last oil change?
767 2018-08-07 22:34:42 Wallahi..
768 2018-08-07 22:34:38 That was your nickname? But olive oil didn't have boobs... I'm lost!
769 2018-08-07 22:34:35 Build it. Oil sovereignty from other nations can only benefit Canada.
770 2018-08-07 22:34:19 Ok my car musta bn updated or some bcos my last oil change was a min ago but I go by the miles. Anywho sticker say at 55984 get another change. Soon as I hit 55985 my signal go off saying maintenance needed l: oil & filter. Sweet 
771 2018-08-07 22:34:15 I should be able to change my own oil 
772 2018-08-07 22:33:55 But one must say clearly that we redistribute de facto the world’s wealth by climate policy. Obviously, the owners of coal and oil will not be enthusiastic about this. One has to free oneself from the  illusion that international climate policy is environmental policy.
773 2018-08-07 22:33:52 A lot of good people worked in the whale oil industry. Pardon me but fuck 'em. This comes right from a @newburycomics staff T-shirt: "Music is life and Life is not an industry" ...and thats all I have to say about THAT. lol
774 2018-08-07 22:33:51 Dude, maintaining a website does not cost “almost nothing.” And there’s no way their revenue doesn’t go down because of this: they’ll have to fire people and push their snake oil products even harder now. And that’s supposing their Internet hosting service doesn’t boot them too.
775 2018-08-07 22:33:49 That’s funny because I was Olive Oil with boobs.
776 2018-08-07 22:33:40 The Word of God say's in ISAIAH 10:27. It shall come to pass in that day That his burden will be taken away from your shoulder, And his yoke from your neck, And the yoke will be destroyed because of the anointing oil.
777 2018-08-07 22:33:38 Red currant jelly is amazing on meat! But Chili oil is great on curry... Hmm which one is the best..?
778 2018-08-07 22:33:27 My coworker did this diet y me dio un asco. The amount of oil she was eating.
779 2018-08-07 22:33:11 @b_momani This exposes Liberals failure with Energy East! Why buy Saudi conflict oil when we can buy from Alberta and Saskatchewan. @ezralevant was right all along.
780 2018-08-07 22:33:10 Follow the Oil & Minerals. . .

Iraq
Afghanistan
Libya
Venezuela
Syria
Yemen

And now - Iran!

Tally ho, the US Pirates say!
781 2018-08-07 22:33:09 your bp lookin like an oil spill lol
782 2018-08-07 22:33:08 he wants to get rid of the reporting every few months and has some pretty big investors, like Saudi Arabia investing in the future when the oil runs out, to back him up
783 2018-08-07 22:32:59 There’s an oil for that
784 2018-08-07 22:32:52 Biberiye yağının rosemary oil olması ...evt uykum kaçınca bunu düşünüyorum 
785 2018-08-07 22:32:41 @annecurtissmith  use some peppermint oil n hemp oil
786 2018-08-07 22:32:33 I wanna drink Oil
787 2018-08-07 22:32:26 HBDนะครับ
788 2018-08-07 22:32:15 What I get so far is that there is no market, which I knew, but it seems that oil companies have already signed to have the crap shipped via KM.  Why are they screaming their heads off?
789 2018-08-07 22:31:45 “Are you wearing all black to protest oil spills?” “Yes”. I’m glad I got out of the house today.
790 2018-08-07 22:31:42 booty rubs w/ baby oil a diffrent type of sensation
791 2018-08-07 22:31:41 & Ukraine threatening the EU which would've also brought the Crimea along with them is what pressured Putin into invading the Crimea & eastern Ukraine! He wasn't gonna let the West influence Ukraine/Crimea which controls so much gas & oil into the EU!
792 2018-08-07 22:31:39 . US oil is generally better quality and closer to market .
793 2018-08-07 22:30:39 “im like this oil”
“?????”
“extra virgin”
794 2018-08-07 22:30:38 I sell oil warme….
795 2018-08-07 22:30:34 Absolutely true. In decades to come water will be the new oil.

797 2018-08-07 22:30:30 Its a Maldonado exit again... If sponsors have a contract in place and want out to follow a driver they have to pay up, just like that oil company did at end of 2013
798 2018-08-07 22:30:29 Oil get power sha... The naive ones who are permanent residents of la-la land are already yapping about "clean energy". As much as renewable energy sources are ideal for human existence, countries like Saudi Arabia will remain relevant for a long time. The lobbying no be here.
799 2018-08-07 22:30:27 oh thank god, for some people medical cannabis oil can mean the difference between hundreds of potentially brain damaging/deadly seizures and none.
In Scotland we recently had such a decision which will save lives and protect quality of life for generations to come.
800 2018-08-07 22:30:22 1. Did she have all her teeth?
2. Was this at an oil change shop?
801 2018-08-07 22:30:12 Yup! You cannot change the matrix competent of the Fcd calc, which is essentially an unconventional version of the Darcy Equation. Analysts who talk about EOR tech achieving wide spread Recovery Factors > 15% in tight oil do not understand this
802 2018-08-07 22:30:08 I would recommend not putting peppermint oil in your eye or really anything, other than maybe eye drops.

804 2018-08-07 22:30:01 Y'all do realise that supporting companies that use palm oil is leading to the death and destruction of orangutans and their habitats? There's chocolate spread that doesn't use palm oil you could easily go for instead without harming endangered animals
805 2018-08-07 22:29:56 I make the best vinaigrette 

I want more flavored vinegars so $end $40 so I can go to the olive oil shop and get some goodies

806 2018-08-07 22:29:49 #Nutella = destroy the land (forest) for palm oil
Palm oil producers use child labour 
Palm oil producers use slaves 

Thats more than enough for me to say stick with the raspberries i picked and jammed . 
No slaves and natural wild bushes ... and i pay myself in berries too!
807 2018-08-07 22:29:27 Oil spill, the block party, black out party, Champagne showers.
808 2018-08-07 22:29:12 @sawbones No shit, I was listening in the car as you were wrapping up the ep and talking about ethics and evidence, and I drove by a shop called "CBD American Shaman" which apparently specializes entirely in oil.
809 2018-08-07 22:29:08 1 why did you have peppermint oil on your hands 2 didn't you learn to wash your hands after handling irritants 3 I have no sympathy
810 2018-08-07 22:28:59 Oil and Water never mix...
811 2018-08-07 22:28:58 my aunts on facebook selling CBD oil and is mad because nobody is ‘supporting’ her i can’t
812 2018-08-07 22:28:55 Is that enough outrage for you? I am so totally disgusted at all Canadians management of oil and gas. The NDP should be tried for treason, the Liberals aren’t far behind and PC was incompetent and ball- less to get several tidewater pipelines built. It’s too late now
813 2018-08-07 22:28:27 Co-sign on this. I also take their fish oil gels.
814 2018-08-07 22:28:23 Yeah if I'd done that trip using the old T5 van it would have : 
A: never made it
B: if had made it drank all of the  engine oil available in France
815 2018-08-07 22:27:56 Pro of living in a small town: when you go to get your oil change and mention to the woman behind the counter offhand that you have a bit of a migraine she TURNS OFF THE LIGHTS IN THE WHOLE PLACE FOR YOU.
816 2018-08-07 22:27:55 Why in the heck are we giving aid to an oil rich country?
817 2018-08-07 22:27:53 This really is premium coconut oil! 
818 2018-08-07 22:27:49 Argentina Is Said to Prepare to Auction Offshore Oil Blocks —-> nota en #Bloomberg con @jongilbert9
819 2018-08-07 22:27:28 The US is, and has been for decades, the most significant threat to regional stability.

Greedy again for more OIL.
820 2018-08-07 22:27:28 I can’t afford to get my oil changed ive been needing it changed for 3 weeks LOL but I don’t have time because I work 60 hours a week but also I don’t money still
821 2018-08-07 22:27:15 So we shouldn't call it 'ethical oil' anymore?
822 2018-08-07 22:27:05 Time for some pepper & stink oil spray! That will clear the area real fast!
823 2018-08-07 22:26:53  palm oil?
824 2018-08-07 22:26:51 Probably bitch ass city again if Liverpool don’t give em a run for their oil money
825 2018-08-07 22:26:48 If Canada wanted to invade Saudi Arabia I would be in favor of letting them "keep all the oil."
826 2018-08-07 22:26:48 Sure, why not. Next up, they’ll start pumping used motor oil directly into the rivers.
827 2018-08-07 22:26:25 Well.. I am the chief.. So you’ll have to report it to me.. *She puts the oil on her hands*
828 2018-08-07 22:26:06 For some reason Diesel engines make the oil really black very quickly.
829 2018-08-07 22:26:01 Theocracy vs republic. Extremism Vs moderate. Educated Vs noneducated. Literate Vs non. Foreign influence, war, drugs, religion, trade, weapons, oil, political, ideologies, colonization and the vacuum it left after, ease of travel, etc etc etc
830 2018-08-07 22:25:58 Well yes, but most major multinationals have a major snake oil product so it’s not an exclusionary aspect.
831 2018-08-07 22:25:58 Also, the infowars family of websites are alive and well and have millions of views each month. Getting kicked off Facebook will mean nothing to them. He'll still be selling his liver cleanse snake oil.
832 2018-08-07 22:25:56 By the end of 2019, Venezuelan crude oil output is expected to plummet to 700,000 b/d, making it likely that it will produce less than the US state of New Mexico.
833 2018-08-07 22:25:55 Guys..you do know crude oil is fossil fuel  yeah??

Nigeria is basically home to millions of dinosaurs.
834 2018-08-07 22:25:49 Hahaaa....hope the expert gets paid in oil
835 2018-08-07 22:25:48 i figured it was the bone. very rich taste -but a lot of thick oil. it was made at nihon machi street fair in San Francisco
836 2018-08-07 22:25:46 So much for modernization....  I'm proud of Canada....  Its not all about oil or arms deals
837 2018-08-07 22:25:36 This is problem when eastern Canada imports foreign oil instead of Canadian oil. But when oil companies are foreign oil they dictate where to import oil and gasoline!
838 2018-08-07 22:25:34 I smacked my head on my drawing and accidentally left an oil stain on the paper. Only I, would I do that and ruin it.
839 2018-08-07 22:25:32 @levinepmc @gmbutts yup. Canada is now an also ran in oil and gas. Great potential out the window. Gone. Like aerospace, like renewable leadership as well which is being funded elsewhere with profits from O/G... why the hell would an engineer stay in this country? Disgusted
840 2018-08-07 22:25:27 Thursday price changes. All data is in: Heating/stove oil to drop by 1.3 cents a litre. Diesel fuel to drop by 9/10ths a litre. Gasoline to drop by 1.9 cents. #nlgasprices Saudi's no threat to supplies, but a pipeline east would secure the country from such a possibility!...
841 2018-08-07 22:25:27 I remember I had liked this girl and bought her an essential oil diffuser for a house warming gift. I haven’t heard from her since.
842 2018-08-07 22:25:21 Stupid is not realizing that AB oil sands benefits all of Canada.
843 2018-08-07 22:25:11 RUTHERFORD: An oil spill is affecting northbound traffic on the New England Hwy near Kyle St. Exercise caution and allow some extra travel time.

845 2018-08-07 22:24:55 I have been doing the oil cleansing method since January, and have never looked back. It’s takes a little more time, but totally worth it.
846 2018-08-07 22:24:50 Latest Trade War Impact:

Bridges, buildings, and towers just got more expensive 

Cars, Oil changes, fruits, and vegetables are impacted too

So, as long as you walk everywhere, only eat meat, and have zero income for municipalities to tax, you should be largely unaffected...
847 2018-08-07 22:24:47 Anda con gas oil pero presentan la factura de NAFTA q es más cara y se quedan con la diferencia eso ya lo llevan en el adn

849 2018-08-07 22:24:33 I mean I guess peppermint oil repels spiders but I have never tried it and I don't really know how the spiders are getting in here in the first place so no idea where to even put the oil. How do spiders get in?! There are no holes for them to come in through, I don't understand!
850 2018-08-07 22:24:25 I am always afraid of a coordinated worldwide attack on the oil depots of the world. World ending terrosim

852 2018-08-07 22:24:13 my favvvvve snack is broccoli, zucchini & califlower baked in the oven for 20 mins with a lil bit of oil + salt n pep 
853 2018-08-07 22:24:09 Brilliant as usual. Kristina can you ask why money not ‘gifted’ to GBR Marine Authority please? PhD in Marine Science is Chairman of board and makeup of entire board appears to make it more suitable than board of bankers, miners and oil company execs.

855 2018-08-07 22:23:58 @AndrewScheer so a country that we dont approve of their human rights doesnt want to sell us oil that we dont really need, but we will keep selling them tanks/ What am i missing here?
856 2018-08-07 22:23:56 Il a fallu une décision de la court suprême des Etats-Unis, par exemple, pour faire cesser le monopole de la Standard Oil dans le pays.
857 2018-08-07 22:23:52 It's not paks. It's Arabs, best friends of weapons buyers and oil shills to the UK. Arabs promote it. As well as hand chopping. Head chopping. But the UK is OK with that. As long as the oil is there.
Pah!
858 2018-08-07 22:23:49 It’s amazingly easy to skip breakfast and make it into the afternoon. I think fear is my problem. I don’t understand what the heck MCT oil is, how I get essential minerals/salts or whatever I need to do a fast.
859 2018-08-07 22:23:46 Lemme get this straight. Ontario bought into this 25cent reduction in the mandatory price of beer nonsense and elected this snake oil salesman because of it?

870 2018-08-07 22:22:40 Problem is the price of Canadian oil just dropped again and if it continues to drop it becomes counter productive to get it out of the ground. We need the pipelines
871 2018-08-07 22:22:31 You can shine leather shoes with a cloth and some vegetable oil.

877 2018-08-07 22:22:06 Probably burns oil 
878 2018-08-07 22:22:04 Lindsay, the stats are clear--SA does not sell much to Canada.  Plenty of other oil producers.  This hurts them more than Canada.
879 2018-08-07 22:21:58 Ya, cause Iran was behind the 9/11 attacks..In the world of the #deepstate, Iran is responsible for all terror.  Not an Iran fan either, but KSA has a much worse record and supports ISIS.  We should ban all Saudi oil and mosque funding.
880 2018-08-07 22:21:44 It's about time these companies stopped abetting this man's lucrative snake oil & shinola empire he so cleverly wrapped in the flag of conspiracy theories and hateful nationalist politics. He's a lying huckster pretending to be a freedom fighter.

882 2018-08-07 22:21:42 As much as I agree I do caution that in the oil industry many jobs have been eliminated that won’t return even though oil production is up. Outsourced, automated etc. The recession proved how little they@can operate in so for many it is a jobless economic recovery.
883 2018-08-07 22:21:26 Well since I have no choice but to eat, I’m making cauliflower roasted in the oven with a little olive oil with spices and parmesan cheese.

928 2018-08-07 22:17:01 Oil money ran dry in both NL and Alberta. Many people with high paying jobs couldn't afford the high ticket items and high mortgages associated with that. The middle class always finds a way to survive.

930 2018-08-07 22:16:44 CBC makes it sound like the differential is justified because WCS is lower API than other blends. Why not just compare the price of WCS when it's in Alberta with the same oil priced in Texas? CBC intentionally misleads to cover for Liberal inability to build infrastructure.
931 2018-08-07 22:16:38 How? We don't need your oil. We barely trade with any of the countries you control or with you. We have way more resources and a much more diversified economy. As the wise Canadian philosopher, Georges Laraque once said, "Good luck with that"

938 2018-08-07 22:16:14 Oh it couldn't be all that oil still sitting in the bottom of gulf could it? We should start to see something of the results by now. Talking about the Oil rig years back that leaked it all out in the gulf.
939 2018-08-07 22:16:07 I have a philosophical question for you on this litigation.  I assume the justification is similar to the justification for the tobacco settlement with the state AGs.  Could this not be used by other AGs to sue oil cos over climate change, or gun manufacturers etc.

977 2018-08-07 22:09:50 My skin glows because I moisturize with OIL. Oil is the answer and depending on what type of skin you have determines what type of oil you should use. Moisturizing with oil prevents your sebaceous glands from producing more acne provoking oil
978 2018-08-07 22:09:49 So you think the parents of murdered children should continue to be lied about and harassed so the NRA can sell more AR 15s? That the memory of those poor dead children should be defaced by a roided-up snake oil salesman? Seriously, WTF is wrong with you?
979 2018-08-07 22:09:48 We can sell guns and give aid to every country and pay for immigrants and refugee's, and we just started paying for our soldiers boots??? WTF kind of country are we? AND we buy other countries oil? We are a F*cking joke!!!
980 2018-08-07 22:09:44 Those tariffs suck ass. A friend who does pottery said he can't make the oil lamps at the moment because he cant get the parts he needs. Thanks to Trump's Tariffs.
981 2018-08-07 22:09:37 46p in pound ....made redundant in oil downturn from 120k a year 
Never got penny Broo despite paying more tax than some pay in lifetime in 10 years .worked  maritime security , drove vans , worked Nhs as Mechanical engineering supervisor. now back in money didnt need work butdid
982 2018-08-07 22:09:27 Give us our  back and lets  invest in our own oil!
983 2018-08-07 22:09:24 Our PAM brand is innovating. New Coconut Oil Spray Pumps let you control how much you use so you can reduce added fat and calories—with the same superior non-stick cooking experience of PAM.
984 2018-08-07 22:09:16 I love that my husband surprised me with a sensual oil kit with bath salts and he even got organic bc he knows me so well 
985 2018-08-07 22:09:13 Iran does not do much business with the USA anyway most of its oil goes to China and most of its imports are from China and Europe Does not agree with the sanctions and will not honor them so what’s the usa doing All of this to make Israel happy that’s all.  Stupid trump
986 2018-08-07 22:09:13 I'm most impressed that this is the edited version that doesn't have the, uh, oil trail.
987 2018-08-07 22:09:03 frozen oven chips (potato and sunflower oil only) and baked beans 
988 2018-08-07 22:09:01 How ironic that an oil nation’s wealth fund is funding an electric car company....
989 2018-08-07 22:09:00 You won’t believe some of the outstanding oil and natural gas production numbers coming out of the Permian Basin! #PermianPower
990 2018-08-07 22:08:40 Yes, but I'm sure a little boiling in oil could have huge benefits all round
991 2018-08-07 22:08:37 She need to lubricate it with some oil first .
992 2018-08-07 22:08:29 That is key observation overlooked by sycophants of technology. EOR is a total failure in tight oil. Can't sweep what can't be swept b/c of nano-darcy perm. Re-sweeping induced fractures non-starter. More cost on mechanical failures of downhole equipment than incremental oil.
993 2018-08-07 22:08:29 Having a car is the best, mostly because you get to experience going in for a 50 dollar oil change but actually finding out you need to pay over 200 dollars for other repairs as well 
994 2018-08-07 22:08:06 Then there's the fact that many outboard motors are two-stroke motors, which require oil in the gas, which is nasty for both the air and the water
995 2018-08-07 22:07:51 #WalkAway #

Trucking or Oil and Gas will hire all at equal pay if they have High School Diploma,  Pass Background Checks and Drug Tests  !

Just like us White Men Do!
996 2018-08-07 22:07:49 did he lose all his dirty oil millions?
997 2018-08-07 22:07:48 My car be happy as fuck today. New gear stick, tires, oil change, and full tank of gas. Spoiled lil bitch
998 2018-08-07 22:07:37 thanks. Was using rosemary, but love frankincence.  used to burn those stones, think it was that... Ill get some oil.
999 2018-08-07 22:07:35 It is far more dangerous using the means of Oil Riggs on the road or using trains to transport oil and natural gas than the pipelines . Pipes like that are closely monitored for any type of leaks. Not only that the profit off of them will actually benefit us in the future 
1000 2018-08-07 22:07:17 Xactly. Quantum Crypto-snake oil.
1001 2018-08-07 22:07:10 Had some leftover pasta. Quartered ten cherry tomatoes, chopped one med onion, peeled two small cloves garlic, thinly sliced half large carrot & six green beans, one stick celery chopped, sunflower oil in pan, gently fried, onion, garlic, celery & carrot for ten mins...lid on...
1002 2018-08-07 22:06:47 I think it's a case government schools dont teach about government. It really makes sense from a standpoint of the less ppl know, the less they are able to recognize when gov has overstepped authority and become oppressive
1003 2018-08-07 22:06:46 America’s Horniest Oil Change Spot Waiting Rooms
1004 2018-08-07 22:06:39 it's not like an instant fix but massaging coconut oil and leaving it in for a while before you wash it out is supposed to help! Also im sure you look great im sorry you're not happy you're always gonna be a babe to me anyway though
1005 2018-08-07 22:06:38 Proud, hopefully it will be more - good for tourism
1006 2018-08-07 22:06:38 Almond oil
1007 2018-08-07 22:06:18 Ofcourse Saudi Arabia is the bigger problem of the two but they are so intertwined with US economy and investments so the bootlicking of the oil sheiks continues. #oildependancy
1008 2018-08-07 22:06:00 Any easier/cheaper alternatives? Wax? Coconut oil?
1009 2018-08-07 22:05:59 It’s not about oil, It's about trade, investment and business
1010 2018-08-07 22:05:46 What would be a bigger moral dissapointment? Kevin Durant colluding with @warriors or Elon Musk @elonmusk possibly using Saudi oil money to buy @Tesla
1011 2018-08-07 22:05:44 When those of us who need wheelchairs make a noise, folks still do the ‘British’ thing of feeling embarrassed & look other way. What we need is for our able bodied fellow travellers to complain or at the very least alert staff, along with us; ‘the squeaky wheels gets the oil’!
1012 2018-08-07 22:05:32 WE’VE BEEN SAYING FOR YEARS, SO WHY IS THE WEST BUYING TERRORIST OIL ? STOP BUYING IT NOW !!!!!!!
1013 2018-08-07 22:05:25 oil massage  you giving us head then let you ride deep and slow,you suck his cock we switch and do that till you can't cum anymore
1014 2018-08-07 22:05:21 We need to use our own resources. But with the understanding that we work with our indigenous ppl & we work towards green energy as our future energy. Phase one in as we phase one out. That will take time but using our own oil would give us better control. SA can not be trusted.
1015 2018-08-07 22:05:13 Worth it.  We don’t need authoritarian money. We have our own oil and lots of other countries will buy our wheat.  #RightSideOfHistory
1016 2018-08-07 22:05:09 Name one time a oil tanker has crashed ONE TIME?
1017 2018-08-07 22:05:04 YES Build the Pipeline to the East we don't want or need oil from the middle east ;)
1018 2018-08-07 22:04:55 Goan check the oil guage
1019 2018-08-07 22:04:40 Also, Alberta oil sands crude could be partially upgraded in Alberta before shipping to eastern Canada; this would have added benefit of requiring less diluent, thus we could ship more in a pipeline. NFLD crude should also be refined in Canada for Can first to displace Saudi oil
1020 2018-08-07 22:04:32 Yes, which makes leftist supported socialism even more insane.  The narrative of radical Islam mixing with "anything goes" leftist socialism doesn't work, IE. mixing water and oil.
1021 2018-08-07 22:04:00 And yet, Venezuelan oil is still in high demand.
1022 2018-08-07 22:03:56 tired of all these alternative dudes who smell like sawdust and murphy's oil soap
1023 2018-08-07 22:03:55 I’m bout to take castor oil Fuc this lol
1024 2018-08-07 22:03:42 for external use on her knees frankincense is a good oil for artheritis
1025 2018-08-07 22:03:37 This article brought to you by Calgary Oil propaganda machine.
1026 2018-08-07 22:03:37 i just sort of make it up every time? and i don't use proper masarepa bc i'm lazy. it's cornmeal, water, salt, butter or oil, til it makes a dough and then roll balls of dough, smack it flat with a coffee cup, fry, repeat
1027 2018-08-07 22:03:32 I’m not surprised, way to much oil
1028 2018-08-07 22:03:28 Designing several hundred ft long oil tankers to traverse Siberia, the Arctic ocean, and break ice is up there in my top 10 coolest sounding jobs
1029 2018-08-07 22:03:27 @JimMiller_155 just throw a little salt and pepper and a some of that seasoning on there put a little olive oil on there and your set to cook!! I personally think u should do it in a frying pan with like 2 or 3 table spoons of olive oil then put in on medium and 3-5min each side
1030 2018-08-07 22:03:24 Thanks Daniel,  was able to follow great patriots I didn't already have....  Grateful..
1031 2018-08-07 22:03:22 Oil level is low... Or Check the SparkPlug...
You're being Alerted...
1032 2018-08-07 22:03:15 Change the oil and plug
1033 2018-08-07 22:02:57 They want to look like they support climate change. No Oil no middle east threats. With out oil the whole middle east would be at war. Not being able to sell your GDP would impoverish the middle east. 2030 is just to fool the incompetent governments like Canada's.
1034 2018-08-07 22:02:43 Maybe reflex from oil droplets?
1035 2018-08-07 22:02:41 It became an oil boom town in 1933 and Humble Oil set up there in 1935. It was called Oil Town USA and was the only town in America that had fee gas and water.
1036 2018-08-07 22:02:40 I am thinking oil money, Chinese or tech money or all.

also white oil sharpie cleans up boost well bc you're literally drawing over the dirt LMAO
1039 2018-08-07 22:02:28 يوم زحمة ومليان مليون حاجة ملهاش لازمة ده غير مشاكلة والله لو اتشال من الاسبوع ماحد هيعترض 
1040 2018-08-07 22:02:24 We have one of the largest oil reserves in the world, we don’t need a dam thing from that sand pit of a country!
1041 2018-08-07 22:02:23 WE have enough OIL in CANADA so as to NOT RELY ON OR IMPORT ANY...and we don't....that is the SHAME in this story!!!! PATHETIC!!! BUY CANADIAN!!!!
1042 2018-08-07 22:02:16 The problem is there is no another country Canada can buy oil from.. because you know our friend Donald Trump what did to Iran 
1043 2018-08-07 22:02:06 On the other hand, since Feb 2017 the US has been drawing down its oil reserves
1044 2018-08-07 22:02:03 The biggest mistake is not taking the shells off after cooking. If you don't it comes out very gritty and the most common flaw found in store bought and even some restaurants. Also finding the right balance between, Olive Oil and Tahini is key but that is more based on taste.
1045 2018-08-07 22:02:02 AAAA THANK U!!! THE LAST SET ON THE RIGHT IS OIL SLICK PATTERNED!!!!!
1046 2018-08-07 22:01:59 when u go to get ur oil changed and they try to charge you 80 dollars cause they think u don’t know shit ha ha just girly things :))))
1047 2018-08-07 22:01:57 The best part about you snake oil salesman and performance artists crying about free speech and 1st amendment. Are the same garbage people not less then 8 months ago crying that NFL players should be fired for expressing their 1st amendment rights. Cognitive dissonance #magats
1048 2018-08-07 22:01:56 I’m aware of the refinery capacity issue of eastern refineries vis-à-vis Alberta oil sands crude. There are solutions, like adding that capacity to existing Canadian refineries which would be cheaper & less risky than building very expensive new refineries from scratch in Alberta
1049 2018-08-07 22:01:54 Even fuel subsidy issues in Nigeria,all products of this indirect rules from the west,exporting crude oil abroad to refine  then pay for the importation back ,crazy
1050 2018-08-07 22:01:54 @Tesla sees the impending oil crisis and will triple in Value within a year. They will end up leading the market.
1051 2018-08-07 22:01:50 She went to Bani Gala with oil reserves, but Imran never used em. Bechari #Rehamkhan
1052 2018-08-07 22:01:43 That’s a huge jar of coconut oil
1053 2018-08-07 22:01:29 Man say Oil field hard to come by unless you know someone .. thank god I got someone in the rail roadjust waiting to get put on 
1054 2018-08-07 22:01:24 And nothing from outside the system (exogenous shocks) can occur - no aliens and no psychic powers, but also not even something as simple as the equivalent of one backwater province suddenly discovering oil
1055 2018-08-07 22:01:19 Freedom of press is not absolute. 
One thing apparent from social media is that a  small number of Americans have read Constitution and fewer understand it
1056 2018-08-07 22:01:07 Just made some potato chips with truffle oil and Parmesan
1057 2018-08-07 22:01:05 thanks Arran, i'll def tell her. i'm sure it would help. i got her putting coconut oil on her knee, castor oil on her thumbs. this would be a great help... So glad  it's helping you...
1058 2018-08-07 22:01:01 I need a hot oil treatment for my beard
1059 2018-08-07 22:00:58 The US passed its prime oil production and reserves at the end of the 1970s. The reserve numbers recently reported are unfortunately over-inflated. The US is still one of the worlds largest importer of foreign oil.
1060 2018-08-07 22:00:57 And I just got my monthly budget oil bill from the oil company.  Hard to believe it will actually be winter here again.  Too darn hot!
1061 2018-08-07 22:00:46 Ironically, the same Ret*rdlicans who deny climate change are the same dummies pushing for an oil pipeline and anti-immigration laws so climate refugees can't get help. What bubble do these idiots live in? Dumb question, we all know it's the bubble known as White America.
1062 2018-08-07 22:00:43 When wiping up spills from your vinyl car upholstery, the sooner you do so, the better results you will have. Use simple cleaners such as baking soda and dish soap, as oil or mineral based cleaners will only make the vinyl stiff.
1063 2018-08-07 22:00:31 I find it funny that a lot of people who support pipelines are against oil tankers and increasing traffic - they don't seem to realize that "getting oil to tidewater" means putting oil on tankers and exporting it.

1070 2018-08-07 22:00:04 Thanks, "ethical palm oil" feels like carbon offsets to me. Did Emanuel Bronner use palm oil in his original recipe?
1071 2018-08-07 21:59:57 Someone tell me why men wear white t-shirts every time they work on their vehicles or change the oil.
1072 2018-08-07 21:59:52 Morrison just borrowed $444 million,  and handed it over to an odd little bunch of ex bankers,  oil,  mining interests.   They bank it immediately,  and enjoy the interest too!   We are paying them loan off.   Weird?  Please explain lii ain't Morrison!
1073 2018-08-07 21:59:52 Just saw this retweeted, so beautifully and soft looking, would caress it so softly, kiss softly, even give a lovely Oil Massage, to feel all over
1074 2018-08-07 21:59:28 Currently getting the oil changed with my Uber driver
1075 2018-08-07 21:59:19 I use coconut oil
1076 2018-08-07 21:59:14 Medicine is real, homeopathy is snake oil
1077 2018-08-07 21:59:14 and that’s a FACT. oil field and the rail road be backing up the brinks truck
1078 2018-08-07 21:59:12 I was just thinking about your lack of sleep and how you should get a diffuser and put some lavender oil up in there
1079 2018-08-07 21:59:05 @GovofCO Real Risk analysis and any gap analysis in the Broomfield Extraction Oil and Gas CDP must be public! Hickenlooper, this is your state and it’s time it reflects transparency & local laws! #uphold301 #copolitics @jaredpolis
1080 2018-08-07 21:59:01 A3: Some other weird ones include a vial of holy water from the Vatican, a town map of Kotor, Montenegro, and some coconut oil from Tahiti. That last one was given to me, though. #TTOT
1081 2018-08-07 21:58:51 Except that we can't refine it here. Canada only has 15 refineries and the vast majority of them can't refine Alberta's oil. Some handle Newfoundland's offshore oil.
1082 2018-08-07 21:58:50 ワーッハッハッハ！
1083 2018-08-07 21:58:40 Why are we dependent on foreign oil anyway?

#WakeUpCall
#EnergyEast could have been built by now. 

Where is the national #EnergyCorridor that transports oil, gas AND electricity from east coast to west coast benefiting millions & generating billions in tax and energy revenue?
1084 2018-08-07 21:58:40 Peppermint oil, good for blinding monkeys and repelling spiders.
1085 2018-08-07 21:58:37 Nah one time Supreme put cooking oil all over the kitchen floor and said he was skating in it omfg I cried I just stared and cried with anger 
1086 2018-08-07 21:58:25 Do you use CBD oil?
1087 2018-08-07 21:58:15 @H1Z1 Squeaky wheel gets the oil, right? More like squeaky kids get to determine weapon balancing. Stop fucking with the game so much. Why is it that the people who are content and happy with the game have to suffer every update. Stop giving baby a bottle.
1088 2018-08-07 21:58:13 Real talk: I'm trying to pray and oil away my bad mood away as we speak
1089 2018-08-07 21:58:09 Obviously a die hard fan, since the Russian oil money came 
1090 2018-08-07 21:57:39 What I don't understand is why people still drink snake oil.
1091 2018-08-07 21:57:35 ITS LITERALLY GARLIC FLAVORED PUBES AND BURNT GRASS WITH A LIGHT OLIVE OIL VINEGARETTE ON CARDBOARD
1092 2018-08-07 21:57:33 Yep, a cunt of the highest order. Alongside his bile he peddles useless supplements called things like Brain Force Plus. Snake oil punter
1093 2018-08-07 21:57:28 Damn, imagine sucking the dick of the SAUDI GOVERNMENT. Arguably the most repressive government in the world. Goodluck with that. When your oil runs out, Saudi Arabia will look like Raqqa.
1094 2018-08-07 21:57:25 So go work in the West Texas oil field. Big $$$$ and bonuses.
1095 2018-08-07 21:57:19 Anymore oil and he’d look darker than Shaq after a few hours in the sun 
1096 2018-08-07 21:57:18 Breaded chicken breast with olive oil and side of potatoes with gravy.
1097 2018-08-07 21:57:06 use castor oil on ur beardline and release that shit
1098 2018-08-07 21:56:57 CBD oil absolutely could give you relief from your arthritis.  Make sure whoever you go with is completely organic!
1099 2018-08-07 21:56:52 @VickieHowell Hi Vickie, first thanks for your kindness during the past year! Your show helped me pass time while hand healed. Daily I massaged apricot oil, 10 drops of each black pepper, eucalyptus, lavender and tea tree oil into my right hand IT WORKED. Crochet/knit again !
1100 2018-08-07 21:56:50 Quebec doesn't want our 'dirty' oil just our dirty oil money.
1101 2018-08-07 21:56:41 I used to spend a butt load on Lush's Sleepy lotion but then I discovered Wilkos sold lavender oil for £1.50. Fuck you Lush and your expensive wizard potions.
1102 2018-08-07 21:56:36 Lots of people agree with you on him being anti-war, but I never got it. He said in a vlog that we should take 50% of Libya's oil for removing Gaddafi. That's on top of the Iraq stuff. He then lied about being for both interventions. He'll say what he knows people want to hear.
1103 2018-08-07 21:56:35 but my snake isn't getting enough oil
1104 2018-08-07 21:56:33 Nah he’s thinking he could get a bit more oil on that 6 pack
1105 2018-08-07 21:56:27 I just spoke to Director Desai Robinson. Website is old. They sold their oil gas company and are looking to switch into a security tech for homeland. Hoping by end of year to officially PR.
1106 2018-08-07 21:56:25 I love the "you can't talk cus we're more successful and you do bad too" shit like we didn't give you your money for the oil. Where do you think that money came from? The British helped you into power, the US is keeping you there. Do not bite the hand that feeds.
1107 2018-08-07 21:56:14 Use the oil
1108 2018-08-07 21:56:14 My boyfriend ain’t condoning that shit this time though... we was up for days squeezing bottles of oil in my damn head 
1109 2018-08-07 21:56:11 Superb book. Even better is its predecessor “Oil, Politics and Violence” which covered the military’s earlier interventions in politics (1966-1976). That book is Nothing short of a masterpiece on Nigeria’s post-independence history.
1110 2018-08-07 21:56:09 So take some hash oil
1111 2018-08-07 21:56:07 You republicans keep going back to Hillary. She isn’t president and it is irrelevant. Your president will get all that is coming to him. Just wait. Don the con filed SIX bankruptcies & screwed bankers, vendors, contractors & employees. He’s a real snake oil salesman....

1113 2018-08-07 21:55:56 You can always get a job with the a carnival. You would fit right in and you can sell your snake oil
1114 2018-08-07 21:55:53 Alex, I'm all for Canadian oil and human rights...but Canada is wrong here.

Who's bright idea was it to call out the Saudi's over twitter and think that is the perfect way to support human rights?

Someone screwed up here...and still no statement from JT.
1115 2018-08-07 21:55:46 How about release the suppressed clean  energy tech. It's suppressed so the big oil can keep making money and they can on slap carbon tax
1116 2018-08-07 21:55:39 I dribble some apple cider vinegar and some olive oil on mine and its... edible
1117 2018-08-07 21:55:22 Gotta get my ends clipped and brows done tomorrow... two auditions... and an oil change. Then I’m good to go!! 
1118 2018-08-07 21:55:18 So nothing to do with ending oil and gas permits, industrial unrest, rising unemployment and the fact the coalition you are part of is an absolute dysfunctional band of ideologically opposed narcissistic fucktards?
1119 2018-08-07 21:55:06 maybe @elonmusk wants to go private because he wants to prevent oil money from acquiring an even higher stake ??? Who knows!!??
1120 2018-08-07 21:55:01 Who cares it’s those corrupt oil money scumbags.
1121 2018-08-07 21:55:00 Beefing up oil profits? What happened to you promises to repair our infrastructure? Not build a freaking wall.
1122 2018-08-07 21:54:52 Health care prices going up? Hey, genius, thank OBAMA & the Democraps for Obamacare. Gas prices? Thank the Dems & Obama for fuel regulations, which Trump is addressing. (BTW, oil prices are set INTERNATIONALLY). Also, Trump doesn't control grocery prices. Go complain to Bezos.

1128 2018-08-07 21:54:15 Judging by how many times @elonmusk promised to improve the car production, I think the world has a better chance of running out of oil before any of this actually happens. What he will do for sure though is cry about it and then go on a @twitter rampage - guaranteed.

1130 2018-08-07 21:54:03 For those that love the smell outside when it rains heavily after a dry season- The smell is called Petrichor, a scent given off by plant oil released when wet and absorbed by the soil.

1132 2018-08-07 21:53:39 Maybe it's a trump-coordinated long con to get Trudeau to fold on supply management in the dairy sector as part of the NAFTA negotiations. Or, maybe it's about oil and Chinese tariffs on US oil. A reshuffling of the deck.
1133 2018-08-07 21:53:21 The only reason westerners go to Saudi is for the mountains of corruption and oil money we can exploit. The front is bombed like you said, but it's not the front you want. Saudi is but a puppet of NATO.

1136 2018-08-07 21:53:07 So it’s about oil then?
1137 2018-08-07 21:53:03 From CT and I know Pizza. Headed to the #OBX last week as most Northeastern folk I was skeptical about if ordering a pie down there. Got a @Maxs_PizzaOBXNC Truffle oil pizza well done and it made my top 3 all time favorite. #pizza #kittyhawk #sothernshores

In other words, not all that accurate.

1142 2018-08-07 21:52:30 Can't wait until this sh*t country runs out of oil.
1143 2018-08-07 21:52:26 YES! Canada needs to stop their hypocritical importation of oil from AK47 countries.
1144 2018-08-07 21:52:22 I hate that climate change is a partisan issue, like people will dump oil into the ocean just to dab on liberals, sure go ahead Brenda laugh now before the rising ocean levels destroy your Floridian McMansion you selfish fuck
1145 2018-08-07 21:52:12 Olives make me sick to my stomach but I can drink olive oil out of a bottle.... I can also eat cut up olives on a pizza..... someone explain this witch craft that I have not yet got to in my studies!
1146 2018-08-07 21:52:10 To borrow Arab oil money directly from the Arabs was going to offend the traditional money suppliers who were borrowing from the Arabs anyway.
1147 2018-08-07 21:52:03 Exposes the failure of Liberal leadership in Energy East. We should be   “Importing ” oil from Alberta and Saskatchewan instead of the Saudis!
1148 2018-08-07 21:52:00 Or don’t fill up the pan half way with fucking oil. Maybe that shit would snap
1149 2018-08-07 21:51:52 for someone to tell me where I can get essential perfume oil to buy
1150 2018-08-07 21:51:49 How many of those infrastructure projects are to safely transport our oil to market?
1151 2018-08-07 21:51:42 Maybe, but sometimes I look at the pic of the issue and know that needs some kind of prescription med to take care of it. Tea tree oil is great, but it isn’t a solution to everything! 
1152 2018-08-07 21:51:36 You don't own US or Iran, so we would continue to do our deals with both sides.
Also this bull shit unilateral offensive and negative influence US abuses to threatened the world, must come to an end.
US dollar should be place where it belong,they don't have oil.

1155 2018-08-07 21:51:31 Stop importing oil From the Saudi’s. It will cost the a billion dollars and help our economy. No brainer.
Oh wait a minute, the Libs won’t allow pipelines to be built so we will need a billion or so buckets and someone to carry them to refineries.
1156 2018-08-07 21:51:26 Too busy getting oil changed

1160 2018-08-07 21:50:43 If only there were plans to move Alberta oil to the east coast. Oh,there was, Energy East, and Justin killed it.
1161 2018-08-07 21:50:35 You sir are correct, I'd also bet the blind love #Trudeau #LPC have for Iran a big reason for this spat -& I will say here & now if eastern Canada stops buying Saudi it will be replaced with US oil - both around the same grade - I imagine the US is very happy about this as well
1162 2018-08-07 21:50:33 Ahhh I love you

1170 2018-08-07 21:50:00 yep. after the US marines and rangers...  Your tweets prove how SA treats its allies-with no gratitude.  Well, I suppose we (the US) needs your oil....
1171 2018-08-07 21:49:57 Brussel sprouts, minced garlic, olive oil, little bit of pepper. Yes please!
1172 2018-08-07 21:49:52 Because that war was waged under false pretenses, was a total failure, killing hundreds of thousands of people, destroying even more lives, expanding the problem more than solving it, costing way too many billions & only making money for the likes of Blackwater & Bush oil friends
1173 2018-08-07 21:49:41 Demoralised by blockchain: the misunderstanding of decentralisation priority. There are ways to implement a trust based system for digital exchange; Blockchain may be the formative stages of that. But now it's just ICOs and snake oil, with a dose of resource exploitation.

1179 2018-08-07 21:49:22 It won't. Saudia Arabia as a whole is a facade. It's built on slavery and oil. Once they start running low on oil they'll fall. Saudia Arabia is more aken to an amusement park than it is to a country.

1182 2018-08-07 21:49:11 Check the oil or maybe the plug is dirty
1183 2018-08-07 21:49:10 Brian.. You are trying to insult a little country that is selfsufficient with oil, not really a threat. Oh NO! Saudi Arabia wont sell us their oil! Oh no!. Yes can you imagine. Well, just like Canada, we wont sell our freedom for oil. Good look abiding to Sharia mate.
1184 2018-08-07 21:49:05 Canada is still importing Saudi Oil?  Saudi Arabia freezing trade with Canada.  Energy East....?
1185 2018-08-07 21:48:59 To be clear: it has been a year since the PXD stock slide on gas oil ratio concerns. Rising ratio associated with declining reservoir pressures. This issue has not been resolved and may be worse
1186 2018-08-07 21:48:51 Then it's just ignorance... The first cars ran on steam. Water is so much more dangerous than oil! Soooo much more!
1187 2018-08-07 21:48:45 That is just utter bullshit.  Figure out how many bbls of oil the average car burns during it lifetime, what it took to produce it, refine it, ship it, and what happens when it is burned.  Common sense is not a flower that grows in every garden.

1189 2018-08-07 21:48:40 Although I'm not an engineer, those who are make a distinction between "heavy oil" and diluted bitumen. If what AB produced were normal heavy oil, I expect there wouldn't be a problem with refining & using it in Canada.

1193 2018-08-07 21:48:24 True or false... schools with less threat mitigation measures pay higher premiums for active shooter insurance? I’ve volunteered veteran owned companies to help schools mitigate threats. Not to sell them snake oil insurance
1194 2018-08-07 21:48:18 Time to get out of the oil business. Destroying our environment is not the way to go
1195 2018-08-07 21:48:18 Canada should first stop selling the Saudi's weapons which they are using to commit human right violations and war crimes. Second they should stop buying their oil. Canada doesn't need a relationship with a tyrannical and oppressive regime like Saudi Arabia.
1196 2018-08-07 21:48:12 I think she said it’s because oil keeps moisture from penetrating our hair or something. She said we just need a shit ton of water and some kind of cream or conditioner that already has oil in it

1206 2018-08-07 21:46:25 Money-losing automaker. What a devious way to discredit such a progressive and future forward company. Guessing Bloomberg likes their oil and diesel car stocks more.

1207 2018-08-07 21:46:19 @AlexSteffen help I don’t know where to go for real info about sustainability practices. Natural gas, oil alternatives etc. the articles all seem to be written by energy companies (flag). I know this isn’t really what you write about but...any thoughts?

1213 2018-08-07 21:45:55 Canada is a net exporter of oil.      We import gas because we don't have the refinery capacity.

1247 2018-08-07 21:43:10 Oh gosh yeah it's expensive! My main issue is my house is usually too crowded for extended painting time. I envy your ability and skill to oil paint!
1248 2018-08-07 21:43:07 You need some peppermint oil or a new house 
1249 2018-08-07 21:43:04 This is same person who voted to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling, you bloated buffoon!  I'm voting for @RosenforNevada she is so much better for Nevada.
1250 2018-08-07 21:43:03 SA is completely irrelevant on the world stage, or as a sustainable country, next to Canada. We have almost as much oil, a hell of a lot more water, infinitely higher education, smarter people, competitive industry. SA is BEGGING for foreign investment, you forget?

1260 2018-08-07 21:41:46 I track US exports daily for a living. Do you know what they're exporting and why they're importing Iraqi oil?
1261 2018-08-07 21:41:39 I appreciate the smell of baby oil in the train station as opposed to the occasional musk 
1262 2018-08-07 21:41:39 Words without action are meaningless. Are we still selling them military Equip. that will be used to trample dissent in KSA?  Our "Enviro loving" PM did just buy an oil pipeline to force it to get done; & #MeToo doesn't seem to apply to him. This govt speaks a lot, does nothing.
1263 2018-08-07 21:41:37 That's nice but... where's my olive oil?
1264 2018-08-07 21:41:35 JT and crew will buy oil from the US rather than Alberta and no longer from Saudi Arabia IMO
1265 2018-08-07 21:41:33 $CL_F finished a larger bounce in wave ((B)) and already made new lows. #Elliottwave #Oil
1266 2018-08-07 21:41:31 I find it inane that the same people who groan about these same corporations doing anything to make a buck, and how evil the corporations are, want the corporations to censor anything the people disagree with.
1267 2018-08-07 21:40:57 I became disabled in 2008 from chronic migraine. Some things (CBD oil) have helped but that was not one of them. People just don’t get it

1271 2018-08-07 21:40:40 Learning how to replace my own lights saved me time and money. I do wanna learn how to change my own oil eventually

1276 2018-08-07 21:40:04 all the replies here are right, doing it in stages is best if you can't go with a pro, olaplex is a godsend if you can get your hands on it (do research and make sure it's real, there's a ton of fakes out there). My stylist used an cream oil lightener as opposed to the powder

1279 2018-08-07 21:39:47 Classic projection 
No, thats what YOU would do.

We remember 9/11 and we are still wondering as to why we still have a relationship with Saudi Arabia (oil).
1280 2018-08-07 21:39:41 It’s got peppermint and tea tree oil, I’ll send you a pic when I get home! It’s fairly cheap too

1282 2018-08-07 21:39:24 3) If you actually think the federal govt directly negotiates the purchase of oil I don't know what to say. 

Oil is a freely traded commodity. Blame the markets, blame capitalism
1283 2018-08-07 21:39:11 Do some research into what is happening in Venezuela. The US and local corporate extremists are waging economic war. Couple that with over reliance on oil, lack of investment in the real economy and big FX debts and you have a perfect storm. It’s nothing to do with socialism.

1285 2018-08-07 21:39:00 Yes, he is a conspiracy monger but there is also his right to be a conspiracy monger.  Better to educate people to recognize these snake oil salesmen.
1286 2018-08-07 21:38:59 Hi Benedict, any idea why these people would be protesting the Kuwait border? Is this just to disrupt oil supply chain?
1287 2018-08-07 21:38:51 I love this meme where conservatives put duct tape on their mouths.   By all means shut your mouth and put tape on it.  If you really want to own the libs, dump a bucket of motor oil on your head.   That'll show them!
1288 2018-08-07 21:38:41 2. Yes. He’s stated several times that the NHL is his goal. Last season he said he stayed in touch with the Oilers org weekly. Mainly talking to Per-Erik Eklund, who scouts Sweden for the Oil, but other guys as well, getting pointers or just asking how he’s doing.

Are maintenance expenses on my truck tax deductible?
As long as the expense is deemed as “ordinary and necessary” by the IRS. Others include insurance, oil, coolant, tires, replacement parts and repairs.  #trucking #transportation
1294 2018-08-07 21:37:27 There has been a natural reluctance to expend $2b+/- on coker units with oil prices where they are. Suncor has put off approving one for Sarnia for years now.
1295 2018-08-07 21:37:21 Do you think the US would be retrenching from the region with the speed it is, if the region and its oil was still crucial to it? Let alone allowing the Russians of all people to fill the vacuum.
1296 2018-08-07 21:37:20 in what ?? that got fuck all besides oil ..

1307 2018-08-07 21:36:12 I completely agree Robert. I strongly suspect that Big Oil has it fingers in the Tesla onslaught.
1308 2018-08-07 21:36:10 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
1309 2018-08-07 21:35:59 They are almost bankruot, can't feed or heat themselves, it's why they will fight to hang on to Scotland.  Our oil and our exports.
1310 2018-08-07 21:35:57 We all know why - to increase oil and gas drilling for his buddies
1311 2018-08-07 21:35:56 A clarifying facial mask, light white, with lily, peacock oil, and exfoliating pumice. It smells strongly lemony.
1312 2018-08-07 21:35:39 it is indeed oil! and thank you ^^
1313 2018-08-07 21:35:38 That's the point, you can't stop buying our oil .
And our economy is too high whether you buy or not .
In addition, we're not supposed to please you .
1314 2018-08-07 21:35:38 I wait until my car says “oil change required”
1315 2018-08-07 21:35:36 Ireally hope so
Those cake slices are huge-
I make 12 of them from a 1/2 sheet cake that's supposed to feed like 30 people
And she always buys six of the German chocolate slices which. Are  LOADED with coconut and oil and just. My heart hurts thinking of eating one of those a day

I will tell the breweries and oil companies to suck it up.

I need a campaign manager.
1321 2018-08-07 21:35:12 This is oil right? I'm loving the distinct color! I'm sure once you complete and varnish it, its gonna have an extremely satisfying look to it.
1322 2018-08-07 21:34:49 PXD’s NGL yield down to basin average from much higher run rate. Oil & NGL up small. Gas up size. Not the best BOE profile
1323 2018-08-07 21:34:32 Cough syrup tastes like used engine oil, gimme that calpol.
1324 2018-08-07 21:34:31 As for wanting the west to join. Well it is a global economy and for our oil to be exported the region needs stability. Besides we've been fighting it for 4 years now on our own, can safely say we didn't and won't need the west.

1328 2018-08-07 21:33:44 Have I got this right...the Saudis have stopped purchasing CDN wheat and barley, because Trudeau and Co. have pissed them off, but we will continue to buy their oil rather than build a pipeline to use our own oil!! Seems to make sense

Pump money into oil sands and find new grain markets. the kingdom's resources will dry up in 50 years and Canada will still be sitting on one of the world's largest oil reserves and a hell of a lot of water.

1381 2018-08-07 21:29:06 i can make 300ml of quality organic oil for the price they charge 30ml of poor qualty solvent stripped rubbish.
1382 2018-08-07 21:29:05 Troy Balderson, ExxonMobil’s inside guy, co-sponsoring SB 315 which basically allows Big Oil to hide their poisoning of the environment while fracking in Ohio.  They allow the poisonous chemicals to remain exempt from public knowledge by calling them trade secrets. Nice Guy. NOT!
1383 2018-08-07 21:29:00 Film 250 of the year was Deepwater Horizon. It is a rare film indeed in my film collection - one starring Mark Wahlberg!. Very good film looking at the tragedy in 2010 on the oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico. Extremely well done with stunning special effects work.
1384 2018-08-07 21:28:50 True. So why are we bringing so much of  their oil down the St. Lawrence in their filthy tankers? We already have our OWN! Ridiculous. What's going on then, JT?
1385 2018-08-07 21:28:39 Bay Scallops are back on special! Beautiful tiny scallops tossed around in a savory medley of marinara, garlic & oil and a touch of white wine over your choice of pasta  @ Trattoria Ravello

Either knife must cut me or blender must slice my finger or oil would splash .

1388 2018-08-07 21:28:17 going to open my account & get my oil change in the morning.
1389 2018-08-07 21:28:12 Thanks David. I was swinging towards that, he just looks more Sheriff-like than Mayor-like! Auction house described painting as "Edwardian oil on canvas Mayor John Atcherley Jebb" - but he was a Victorian Mayor (1894) and an Edwardian Sheriff (1905).
1390 2018-08-07 21:28:10 @qvcuk Lovely to see @JudithWilliamsU for the special shows this week! Absolutely adore her Rose Oil... Its amazing! Will definitely be trying some more of her range ! x
1391 2018-08-07 21:27:57 Take a relaxing swim in the Glistening Oil Lazy River and drift off as you become complaeted
1392 2018-08-07 21:27:54 Tbh all these people - liberal or not - moaning about Alex Jones, completely disregarding the damage he actually does (or the fact that he is a fucking snake oil salesman), would be less annoying if they had any kind of legal standing 
1393 2018-08-07 21:27:38 i’m still pressed that someone with crusty ass skin asked me why my face was shiny. bitch it’s my Hyaluronic Acid and Rosehip Oil
1394 2018-08-07 21:27:34 Youre trippin 

They taste metallic and who knows how nasty the oil they cook it in
1395 2018-08-07 21:27:25 Loughgall Snout Pie:
1. 1 tonne of ammonium nitrate.
2. 8 litres of household fuel oil, or diesel if not available.
3. Car battery, tinfoil, clothes-peg, wire. 
Gently mix over very low heat. Add nitromethane for flavour. Leave in JCB bucket & destroy rival drug dealers.
1396 2018-08-07 21:27:13 i just changed the oil in my car completely by myself, including driving it on & off the ramps  so basically you can’t tell me shit right now
1397 2018-08-07 21:27:09 Jimmy, your naivety is adorable. Explain to the class why there is a need to debunk something that everyone knows (except Alex Jones that is) is clearly FALSE? This guy makes shit up as a matter of expediency and the 1st amendment was not designed for him to sell his snake oil

1400 2018-08-07 21:26:54 A lot of people got very rich in the Iran deal. Iran knows who got the money. I saw a picture of the offices of an Iranian oil prospecting company burning yesterday, and that's probably the mildly incriminating stuff.
1401 2018-08-07 21:26:53 Why sad? Fry it up in some oil and garlic, add some chopped scallions and cilentro, top with a fried egg. I'd eat it right now!
1402 2018-08-07 21:26:37 If reham khan stoops any lower, she'll discover oil reserves.
1403 2018-08-07 21:26:31 Why not put out government incentives to go entirely off of crude oil?
1404 2018-08-07 21:26:28 i bought oil colors today wow i regret my decision and i suck
1405 2018-08-07 21:26:20 Hope the 15yrs (work in progress)of democracy and elections in #Iraq is going well for u, oil rich nation with great history goes back thousands of years its ppl should be very wealthy and happy
1406 2018-08-07 21:25:53 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
1407 2018-08-07 21:25:33 Its because the Saudi Arabian Dictator who calls himself a 'Prince' and american oil companies are profiting from the stock market on imported Saudi Arabian oil.

Saudi owned Fox news isn't helping any.
1408 2018-08-07 21:25:30 Teldrassil will be broken into florets. Teldrassil will be tossed into a sauté pan with a teaspoon of oil and mixed with the buffalo sauce.
1409 2018-08-07 21:25:29 he would owns energy rules the world,SA is proving it can do whatever it wants because it produces oil that fuels the world.
1410 2018-08-07 21:25:26 Oil??
1411 2018-08-07 21:24:53 You know what goes great on tacos? Hemp CBD oil. Why? Because that taco is good for the soul, but CBD is good for your ECS. 
1412 2018-08-07 21:24:49 its my ritual every night,a spoonful of magic oil works wonders,my old collie has his own recipe for his arteritis aswell, we both organic oil lovers,hes 15
1413 2018-08-07 21:24:45 You are wrong, Eastern Refineries already process heavy oil, and furthermore Energy East could very easily send a blend down the line... how about you leave the engineering to the people that know what they’re doing.
1414 2018-08-07 21:24:37 @LushLtd very frustrated after using razzle dazzle bath oil, used correctly and as advised by the lady who served me and I have come out stained as pink as the pink panther 
1415 2018-08-07 21:24:36 Garlic oil! If you have garlic pills in the house, just poke a hole in one and squeeze it in your ear. If you have regular garlic, you can use that, too. Google that method.
1416 2018-08-07 21:24:30 What about the west? What’s wrong with the Alberta oil???
1417 2018-08-07 21:24:30 Idk how many times I go inside a customer's car and I just see a bag of weed or an oil pen lmao
1418 2018-08-07 21:24:27 They all did a deal with that asshole Donald Trump.  He was over there suckholing for oil  & other personal asset reasons.  I’m tired of BS & politics.  I believe in freedom & a new age type of leadership that is beyond the scope of America.  All Lives Matter !
1419 2018-08-07 21:24:27 Most awkward oil change experience of my life. Employees arguing and venting to me as I wait to pay. It was horrible. @jiffylube
1420 2018-08-07 21:24:09 !!! that’s good to know bc THC gives me a lot of anxiety too (but i love weed too much so i smoke and mix it with cbd oil lol)
1421 2018-08-07 21:23:53 So it’s confirmed, the oil billionaires are going to throw 80 billion at these cars?
1422 2018-08-07 21:23:52 people advertise cbd oil like its fucking jesus' piss dfkm
1423 2018-08-07 21:23:49 How many fans would Tesla have if bought out by a Saudi oil prince? Do we like oil now?
1424 2018-08-07 21:23:39 I can imagine Iran will sell to Russia and Russia will sell to the EU. Iran will lose out with a middleman. Trump simply wants higher crude oil prices so fracking makes a profit.
1425 2018-08-07 21:23:38 Hair

• It’s a frizz tamer 
-Smooth on ends or lightly over loose strands 

• It’s a dandruff treatment 
-Lightly massage into doors & let it sit for a few minutes.Then shampoo 

• It’s a Oil Treatment 
- Apply from roots to ends ,comb, wrap head & sit for 15 min then shampoo
1426 2018-08-07 21:23:17 If you struggle with humidity ruining your straight hair, put some macadamia oil in it after you straighten it. My hair never gets frizzy anymore 
1427 2018-08-07 21:23:10 I’m like 99% sure there was olive oil on the pong balls. Couldn’t get a good grip

1429 2018-08-07 21:23:05 @JustinTrudeau Why do guys need the Saudis for ? You got enough oil for yourself right ?
1430 2018-08-07 21:22:51 @realDonaldTrump ANYTHING YOU SAY IS FAKE NEWS-YOU ARE A FAKE and a flim-flam man, a snake oil salesman and a traitor to this nation. They are getting close to getting all this information out whether your zombies and cult members you have recruited believe it or not. Violence?
1431 2018-08-07 21:22:40 That ain’t olive oil #supernaturaluk
1432 2018-08-07 21:22:34 And not dump oil and gasoline into our precious Salish sea. We have an Exxon Valdez worth of oil and gas being washed into our Salish Sea every year. Great idea, Senator. Don't stop there! You can do more. I'm with you.
1433 2018-08-07 21:22:30 I went to a Westlaw Edge training this morning and they had a mini donut making contraption there.  You could smell the oil when you walked in.
1434 2018-08-07 21:22:26 NZ can save a lot of money if we reduce our largest import expenditure. That is oil.
The buses are so good for most.
But in our large city are it's difficult to have buses in all directions.
1435 2018-08-07 21:22:25 Because Canada has a better education system and Saudis only have oil money. Kind of shooting yourself in the foot there.
1436 2018-08-07 21:22:25 The mechanics changing my oil are jamming out to boo’d up all singing their hearts out 
1437 2018-08-07 21:22:23 It's "hell yeah". Seeing as we import only 10% crude oil from SA I think we will be fine.
1438 2018-08-07 21:22:22 Will one of those be an oil rig on leith hill, or an oil tanker stuck in the rear, beautiful sunken, steep single lane road that is Coldharbour Lane?

1442 2018-08-07 21:22:04 I tried to make saffron risotto but I added too much olive oil and now I'm sad
1443 2018-08-07 21:22:02 Salty asf my oil changes are $60-$80. 
1444 2018-08-07 21:21:59 Well to be clear "We" don't do any of that. Private enterprise buys, sells and refines oil. They are the ones with the moral failings that prefer unethical sources of petroleum because it is more profitable.
1445 2018-08-07 21:21:53 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.

1448 2018-08-07 21:21:37 There's a lot of misunderstanding regarding the Antiquities Act of 1906. (Needs to be overhauled w/o sweeping application as it stands.) Many interpret it the way it shouldn't be interpreted to promote preservationist-rather than conservationist- policies.
1449 2018-08-07 21:21:26 Oil sanctions against Iran not due till November. Doubt if Trump cares where EU gets its oil from !

1453 2018-08-07 21:20:51 canabis cbd oil is legal and can be bought at holland & barrets but its very expensive and has low properties, usually made with solvents to strip the cannabanoids from the plant, organic oil infusion is best
1454 2018-08-07 21:20:44 Sorry you are wrong.   Short sellers are out to destroy Tesla.   They are led by Jim Chanos well connected to gOP and oil interests.   Other clean energy also attacked.  Oil owns the media.  You.
1455 2018-08-07 21:20:32 guy at the shop said my car needs "european oil" lmao
1456 2018-08-07 21:20:30 Thank you so much for ur respect
Nice education
I’m living in one of the G20 country 
To let U know, the proven oil reserves in Saudi Arabia are the 2nd largest in the world. To let u know Saudi Arabia is the 19th-largest economy in the world by GDP (748,003 million US$)
1457 2018-08-07 21:20:29 The Trump administration bringing asbestos back to the market is a good sign for my plan to sell whale oil lamps to the military
1458 2018-08-07 21:20:25 It means he doesn't ever have to care what CNBC. Fox News, Bloomberg, or Business Insider has to say ever again. No more analysts telling him how to build cars. No more oil and car company sneaky social media campaigns to worry about
1459 2018-08-07 21:20:24 You have to hit trump where it hurts dr zarif.his weakness is high oil prices,thats why he backed down and  offered no condition talks.iran will be fine.
1460 2018-08-07 21:20:23 not to mention, you can't build an oil fund (too late anyway) and at the same time spend that money.
1461 2018-08-07 21:20:16 The vapes are oil defusers not for weed

1464 2018-08-07 21:19:58 Many Central Canadians (Trudeau's base) literally hate Albertans more than Saudi or Trump's oil. 

The only way we will get oil to tidewater (and cross-country) is if Scheer wins a majority and has the fortitude to deploy the military if necessary to maintain rule of law.
1465 2018-08-07 21:19:58 also my hair is been so nice lately.. im glad i been doing this argan oil hair mask.. its so soft and bouncy
1466 2018-08-07 21:19:55 As long as it doesn't overly moisturise the skin you'll be absolutely fine. Just steer clear of baby oil in the bath. Epsom bath salts are great. Perhaps pick a time for it being least active as well. How long have you had your stoma?
1467 2018-08-07 21:19:33 and don't say oil money. There isn't enough tax revenue from oil currently and the UK government is currently subsidising extraction.
1468 2018-08-07 21:19:19 1) I called you alt-right, not Trudeau, and that isn't about race anyway. You literally spewed a stream of textbook alt-right talking points..so? 

2) Govt handouts are not a free speech issue

3) Private enterprise buys Saudi oil, go shame them not your fellow Canadians

1472 2018-08-07 21:18:58 £72m for Spains number 3 seems a bit high to me, but its only gangsta oil money, so who cares!! Spurs will sign Grealish tomorrow for stooopid money, that may well be it. No doubt sell a few once prem window has closed. Cricket? Never heard of it!!

1474 2018-08-07 21:18:57 I did worse than that. B4 I discovered the smart idea of gloves I washed my hands over & over & said never again. Then getting ready for bed I took out my contacts. Next morning put them in & started yelling, even after all that washing, the oil got on my lenses. It was BAD!!
1475 2018-08-07 21:18:55 I think it’s very sad how some guys can’t do oil changes
1476 2018-08-07 21:18:53 Will post more charts later tired and going to bed. OIL top Ticked short still holding and $SPX funny top today was 2863.75 must be joking. .25 from that tweet I posted about 2864. Sometimes I really do think someones watching my tweets. So weird...
1477 2018-08-07 21:18:53 We side with Saudi Arabia with their genocide in Yemen because of their money and their oil. But now we have abandoned Canada, in their recent fight with the Saudis. This is a disgusting display of greed and power. We can't get the pos Trump out of office fast enough.
1478 2018-08-07 21:18:50 Asad umar wiĺl reduce oil prices q k wo patwari nai hy
1479 2018-08-07 21:18:49 Oh no no no. 5% meat/cut the fat off/don’t use oil or use the spray light instead and you’ll notice a massive difference 
1480 2018-08-07 21:18:48 oh sorry, meant to say my feelings over decades, real, but not helpful. Struggling to not voice downer news, but increasingly hard to allow ignorance everywhere. Bush Sr. goes to grave as 'junk science' promoter for oil. Trump just dumb enough to believe it then and now. argggg!
1481 2018-08-07 21:18:35 We have enough oil. We don't need Iran and oil prices should not be rising.
1482 2018-08-07 21:18:27 @chedetofficial you know this nation has the resources, oil. But the car industry is already saturated. The highways are already cramped..the rural folks in Sabah and Sarawak are still in dire need of fair infrastructure. You are neglecting them for the sake of your ego.
1483 2018-08-07 21:18:25 It was big oil
1484 2018-08-07 21:18:01 I thought it would be smart to sit on the beach today for 7 hours and just apply oil to my caucasian skin .... so here I am looking like a ripe tomato in a crazy amount of pain
1485 2018-08-07 21:17:56 Suggestions: 
-Try the Whole 30.
-Limit your amount of bread and sugar.
-No more snacks/sodas. 
-Don't eat after 8PM (wait 12 hours).
-Workout BEFORE you eat breakfast (weights>cardio)
Also, I take a multivitamin, fish oil pill (heart), and a spoonful of coconut oil every day.
1486 2018-08-07 21:17:49 Who's gullible? I said nothing about not having border security. Hes not trying to deflect you are. The Saudis are having a temper tantrum... oh well. I'd prefer we dont deal with them anyway. We have the 3rd biggest oil stores on the planet we just lack refineries.
1487 2018-08-07 21:17:47 What a jerk..my pain doc is awesome been with him since the beginning 2006 he was all for it..but started me on non-thc oil no good waste of money but did what he said finally got the good stuff..it was worth the wait hopefully it helps u too Valery stay strong girl

1489 2018-08-07 21:17:34 Yes let’s keep that relationship tight!! They let women start driving cars last week. Build Energy East!! We don’t need their oil or their BS.
1490 2018-08-07 21:17:34 That’s why Tesla car is so worth it! No need to depend on oil from Iran. Get it @POTUS? Extend full EV tax credits for Tesla up to year 2020. The more Tesla EV sold in , the more  jobs created by Tesla and less dependence on foreign oil. $TSLA
1491 2018-08-07 21:17:23 How do countries  without  oil survive?  I didn't  know  that leadership in my country is all about price of oil. But I know there was global economic melt down  in 2008 and we had a government  that managed the economy  better.  We also had life threatening Ebola  outbreak
1492 2018-08-07 21:17:20 @BBCSimonJack or could the inadvertent result be the beginning of end of the supremacy of the dollar on international markets, with Euros for instance, used for trading oil #bbcnews
1493 2018-08-07 21:17:16 1/5 of Iran crude came to the EU. But Trumps sanctions are already in action. It means the EU could end up buying Russian crude oil. Is that what Trump wants?
1494 2018-08-07 21:17:11 Now that’s a laugh. Of all broadcasters the @BBCWorld has always leaned on the side of the oil rich #Arab world.
1495 2018-08-07 21:17:11 Girl power!
1496 2018-08-07 21:17:02 Hugo Chavez (which is the context of my original statement) managed to ruin Venezuela without their help.

The cia didn't force him to steel billions of $ of oil money, fail to diversify the economy, give Cuba huge oil subsidies, etc.

The cia did bad, but not everything...
1497 2018-08-07 21:16:29 Diversity from the oil.. good direction.

1499 2018-08-07 21:16:06 Just like all those ones up in the north country. All that energy ruining those gorgeous hills, and the locals get nothing. It all goes to his voters in NYC.  Except for the noise, fires, and leaking oil.

1504 2018-08-07 21:15:31 No. This makes gas prices more expensive, cuts US investments into Iran's economy (costing us jobs), and prevents us from buying Iranian oil. Israel wants this for their own interests. They are pathetic.
1505 2018-08-07 21:15:16 Used cAr purchase most GTO but there is some new car leases occasionally that pencil out to be like 0% and 24-36 months for. Brand new ride maintence and oil changes usually included in most leases as it’s cheap for a new car so buy a used one or lease a new one on a special
1506 2018-08-07 21:14:44 Isn't olive oil meant to be good? Or is that just to clear blockages...?
1507 2018-08-07 21:14:30 From a country that doesn’t have “principals” that’s rather rich!  It’s an idiotic response from a country that has a terrible record on human rights.  Canadians should stand up and be counted. Let’s ban all oil shipments from Saudi Arabia.
1508 2018-08-07 21:14:29 He probably did that without the boinking license Londoners need now, :D.
1509 2018-08-07 21:14:28 Yoruba people put enough oil in their stew for America to invade.
1510 2018-08-07 21:14:23 What’s in the beard oil you ask? I pour a lil of my juice box in each bottle.
1511 2018-08-07 21:14:13 @Grubhub when are you going to start servicing Oil City Pennsylvania I could go for some tacos from taco bell or a subway sandwich
1512 2018-08-07 21:14:10 Had the oil way before i had the tec like i ain’t always have money but i always had respect
1513 2018-08-07 21:14:08 Race baiting- calling people "alt right" who don't agree with you.

Free Speech- why don't you ask the groups who feed the poor who were denied funding this year about that. 

Human rights- using that to virtue signal while importing 100,000 barrels of Saudi oil per day.
1514 2018-08-07 21:14:07 Thanks, Jiffy Lube, for the oil change and for interrupting me. #Mansplaining

1521 2018-08-07 21:13:21 I don’t care that Saudi Arabia is Muslim. I care that they are anti-democratic, anti-capitalist, mysogynistic, and state sponsors of hate speech and terror. Fund alternative energy and let these bastards choke on their oil. I stand with 
1522 2018-08-07 21:13:15 good thing they produce their own oil. oh wait.

1524 2018-08-07 21:12:47 I was waiting for an oil change, it was the best I could do on my phone 
1525 2018-08-07 21:12:34 Just earlier, I applied oil onto my sword so it has great sharpness. If you touch it even slightly, your fingers would be cut and blood could spill.
1526 2018-08-07 21:12:33 At the risk of over analysing a joke, can you be indifferent to olives? People either seem to love them or think they horrible, woody, greasy abominations that should only be crushed, many times, the pulp incinerated and the oil only used in bolognaise sauce.
1527 2018-08-07 21:12:30 I hope there isn't any oil nearby, or Stinky @SecretaryZinke will demolish every one of them.
1528 2018-08-07 21:12:25 you forgot the most important part, OIL.
1529 2018-08-07 21:12:15 Chuck's mind was made up before nomination. 
Any rhetoric coming out of his mouth to contrary is a lie
1530 2018-08-07 21:12:13 HAHAHA the guy at the front desk trolled my bf and called him to say that they found a pair of his underwear in my car while doing the oil change. I had nothing to do with it and I'm disappointed tbh.
(The two know each other, all in good fun)
1531 2018-08-07 21:12:05 oil is solar energy... from some time ago admittedly.
1532 2018-08-07 21:11:50 and you cant already own someones time they choose how to spend it, you can however already own all the oil
1533 2018-08-07 21:11:46 But your happy using Muslim oil which actually oppressed people but attack The burka really, it’s like saying ban the cross, stop getting emotional, Muslims and Islam have never been a problem we have it time to take our responsibility rather than just blame Islam
1534 2018-08-07 21:11:41 Yes they are. Snake oil salesmen pretending to be statesmen.
1535 2018-08-07 21:11:35 The squeaky wheel Little Johnny Howard should get no more oil Johnny you had your time  #goverment #Badplolises
1536 2018-08-07 21:11:24 This whole @SomersetsShave business is pretty ridiculous. I went from a set of:
1. Pre-shave
2. Shaving soap 
3. Coarse blade
4. Fine blade
5. Aftershave

To
1. Medium blade
2. Somerset’s oil

My toiletries bag was maxed out with de-wookieing stuff alone.
1537 2018-08-07 21:11:19 Where does the oil go by rail? Which refineries?
1538 2018-08-07 21:11:14 Literally wrestling with shirtless bodies covered with oil
1539 2018-08-07 21:10:56 5/ Nigerians need to know what they signing into. The PIB is still in process. Nigeria cannot afford to sign any Oil Reserve-based finance contract for now. We need to look at this proposal by the @NNPCgroup very carefully. It’s not clear to Nigerians @ProfOsinbajo

1541 2018-08-07 21:10:49 I am just wondering how many Canadians knew we imported oil and why?
1542 2018-08-07 21:10:48 @GovofCO #copolitics keep Broomfield honest....no drilling without transparency! Better yet tell oil and gas #nomorewells
1543 2018-08-07 21:10:45 There are bunch of oil refineries in MTL that were shut down by head offices in Calgary to save a nickel per litre.   Do some research  FFS.

1549 2018-08-07 21:09:43 Also the board is obligated to seek higher offers.  I always thought $TSLA would get into a bidding war from oil companies or $MSFT (or similar) as a hedge against disruption. Member 3Par?
1550 2018-08-07 21:09:33 Turn natural peanut butter upside down overnight before stirring it up. The oil rises to the bottom of the jar which makes it easier and less messy to stir in.
1551 2018-08-07 21:09:29 Spent part of the afternoon changing  oil and rotating tires with my 5 year old. Then we went to the store for ice cream as a reward. He was so proud telling folks that he earned his ice cream helping daddy fix the car. He also bragged that his hands were greasy.  #prouddad
1552 2018-08-07 21:09:07 Another nonsense tweet from Chuck, he knows is meaningless.  Never seen a black female iron worker, rig deck hand, electrician or auto mechanic. Blue collar jobs dominated by mainly by white males because others dont get skills or apply. 
Why? Good question
1553 2018-08-07 21:09:05 Real Risk analysis and any gap analysis in the Broomfield Extraction Oil and Gas CDP must be public! Hickenlooper, this is your state and it’s time it reflects transparency & local laws! @broomfield #broomfield #uphold301 @GovofCO #copolitics
1554 2018-08-07 21:09:03 Anyone else feel like they get talked down to during an oil change? I mean, I freely admitted that I was irresponsible. Let’s not celebrate it.
1555 2018-08-07 21:08:58 Slice a lemon and squeeze both halves into a small bowl (minus the seeds). Add two tablespoons of sugar and a tablespoon of honey, stir well to form a medium-thick consistency, then gently rub into your face in circles, about 10 minutes before bathing. Same with soda × oil scrub
1556 2018-08-07 21:08:51 How big were they? Any chance the holes could be filled with a drop of water or oil held together by surface tension and used for magnification?
1557 2018-08-07 21:08:42 theres different forms,if u smoke it then it will get u stoned but infused in oil u have a choice to just take the cbd cannabanoids (benificial but dont get u stoned) or to have the active thc which will. i have the non active cbd. smoking kills,oils healthy
1558 2018-08-07 21:08:35 We need someone to make engines to be run on water or vegetable oil! I'm no engineer but I feel this can be done... It's 2018 for God sakes. The oil industry will never budge on that cuz the world is run by money 
1559 2018-08-07 21:08:25 Tell them to Go F themselves. We have our own oil

1564 2018-08-07 21:07:51 Nah, that thing ("hers") is immortal. All it wants is petrol, oil, and the odd tyre or two and it's quite happy to carry on. Last test failed on an oil drip FFS and was probably from me throwing some in a few days before. Mine is an A6 C5.
1565 2018-08-07 21:07:49 But by opposing energy east you are for buying Saudi oil.
1566 2018-08-07 21:07:42 It will blow up any second and kill everybody in Canada, and poison all the water, and the earth, and murder all the puppies and kittens...

Oh, it carries foreign oil? Then it's perfectly safe. Halal certified...
1567 2018-08-07 21:07:37 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.

1569 2018-08-07 21:07:09 $1.5 billion to be exact. Maybe we should source our oil from home?
1570 2018-08-07 21:07:06 1. wash once a week 
2. use a gentle/nourishing shampoo and conditioner
3. hair mask (could be oils/cream anything for 15 minutes, an hour? I wing it)
4. rub in a tiny bit of oil that is Good for Hair (not too much to avoid greasiness)
5. leave it to dry in a braid/ponytail
1571 2018-08-07 21:07:04 Proverbs 5:3-5 - For the lips of an immoral woman drip honey, and her mouth is smoother than oil; but in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword, her feet go down to death, her steps lay hold of hell.
1572 2018-08-07 21:07:03 Your insisting it's a fact but there are projects doing exactly that with gold silver oil and others . The non geo locked access is something which is appealing and that's reflected in the price of these tokens, which I concede may be bloated in some cases
1573 2018-08-07 21:07:03 Might hit oil and have more fun money

1575 2018-08-07 21:06:57 Oil money is no more dirty than other money as long as it's used for "clean" purposes. Saudi et al. are preparing for a world without fossil fuels.

1578 2018-08-07 21:06:44 Wonder if we are gonna stop buying their oil. If only there was a pipeline going east. An energy east pipeline. Wonder how how many human rights activists Alberta has in jail. Good thing those down stream emissions helped that project get shovels in the......never mind
1579 2018-08-07 21:06:43 I've actually participated in one and I came second out of 8. That was awful but we had no oil at least.

1585 2018-08-07 21:06:12 Caution: Sassafras is no longer considered safe for human consumption, especially when safrole oil is included. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration currently prohibits sassafras bark, oil, and safrole as flavorings or food additives. ... The FDA banned sassafras use in 1979...
1586 2018-08-07 21:06:07 Work on the farm would have stopped in January if we relied only on British oil, British chemicals and fertilizer and British machines. In my opinion this oversimplification of food security does the industry no favours.

1589 2018-08-07 21:05:54 A bit like when the power goes out. You suddenly realize what you took for granted. The world has been long removed from an energy crisis, so much so it seems impossible to happen. The globe thinks it's "Dooms day" level analysis. 
It isn't.
It's coming to a gas station near you!

1597 2018-08-07 21:04:46 Europe, a CONTINENT, has experienced 10 incidences of oil spills in 40 years. Nigeria? 9,343 oil spills in the past 10 years. 9,343. Air pollution, water contamination, depletion of wild life, acid rain, deforestation. The whole Niger delta is in a state of emergency. Wow.
1598 2018-08-07 21:04:43 However, the part of #Brexit that is most sad is (and here I plead guilty to a little British exceptionalism myself in the past) I always believed it could never happen here.

1600 2018-08-07 21:04:40 Yes, but the Saudi potential investment in Tesla is a vision of a future where Oil is no longer king and used only as a lubricant, etc. And, that is a very optimistic outlook for the future of all earthlings.
1601 2018-08-07 21:04:39 He should at least disclose that this is a paid ad and tell us which logging or oil company he owes favors to!
1602 2018-08-07 21:04:37 And oil rigs!
1603 2018-08-07 21:04:37 Why not take your own balls and put them in a vice! @Bill_Morneau We’re a quarter or two away from recession / depression after next wave of tariffs and failing to get oil to tide water or to east coast will ensure out unemployment rate again heads north of 7%, inflation jumps!
1604 2018-08-07 21:04:33 Theresa May’s house is a mess with Brexit and no country should depend on Trump. We need to quit screwing around and build a few pipelines and stop buying Saudi oil.

1609 2018-08-07 21:04:03 I did. I put it in my food processor and then cooked it with a little olive oil, salt & pepper.
1610 2018-08-07 21:03:57 Much stupidity is so spread here. Some canadian think it’s just about traveling to Saudi while they have nothing to know about the 750000 barrels of oil daily exported to them. Good luck with finding another supplier MF

1613 2018-08-07 21:03:24 Some men make more than some women. Some women make more than some men. Men have a higher chance of going into construction,mining, sanitation,oil rigs, s.t.e.m fields and so on and so forth. Women do not. That's why they are paid less. You guys wanna be paid more, take more risk

1618 2018-08-07 21:02:46 Because the liberals want more expensive gas. Trudeau also said he wants oil sands oil to stay in the ground. This is plying right into liberals plan to create an oil shortage in Canada so prices increase and we drive less.

1622 2018-08-07 21:02:34 my only complaint with @DarkestMinds is that ruby’s curls were lookin too vibrant for her to have been locked up in labor camps for years. i know she didn’t have no coconut oil or bonnets up in there!!
1623 2018-08-07 21:02:34 I just mentioned his concern. I don’t know if he did or not. I do know he’s a snake oil salesman, and it’s unnerving that so many people are all in.
1624 2018-08-07 21:02:32 By buying products with palm oil, you are supporting an industry that burns orangutans alive (as well as other native forest animals) by burning down their habitats for palm plantations. These are intelligent beings who can speak via ASL and communicate their feelings. (1/2)
1625 2018-08-07 21:02:03 Simply put - Greenpeace is not being paid to protest the oil and gas industry anywhere else - just Canada.  
Here is a plan, we take up a collection, pay all Greenpeace members to go protest in Saudi Arabia...and see what happens .
1626 2018-08-07 21:02:03 So proud of myself :

Never use heat (last time I straightened my hair was back an March and it had been about 7 months before that since I used heat) 

Coconut oil / rose hip oil 

My hair is finally blessed. Be patient.
1627 2018-08-07 21:02:02 Nutella's use of palm oil is bad for us and the environment.
1628 2018-08-07 21:02:02 is peddling snake oil like dr oz and david wolfe different as well because the shit they say affects people’s health and lives?
1629 2018-08-07 21:01:43 So working people can't get an oil change at 4:30pm at Beaufort, SC #walmart on Robert Smalls Pkwy.
1630 2018-08-07 21:01:33 You definitely missed the point of why Alex Jones is being censored... you missed the difference between hate speech and free speech. You follow conspiracy theorists and believe what they have to say even when their main sponsor is snake oil pills...
1631 2018-08-07 21:01:32 dont make up shit to go in there...republicans in office made up a war..to get oil basically .
1632 2018-08-07 21:01:30 I don’t have peppermint oil 
1633 2018-08-07 21:01:29 Which. Kinda explains exactly all the corruption and wheeling and dealing of the mid east, Trump, ExxonMobil,.. The whole oil thing. They fear solar and wind.
1634 2018-08-07 21:01:15 I think the most common SFAs (butter, palm oil, coconut oil, chicken fat, cheese, etc) all are predominantly palmitate, with stearate at around 10% of total weight vs. ~25% palmitate. Even beef tallow is 26% palmitate and only 14% stearate. So no easy way to use this info.
1635 2018-08-07 21:01:07 To “restock” the oil fields!
1636 2018-08-07 21:01:05 The government of Canada has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Kevin Hart in a burlap wig.

1638 2018-08-07 21:00:43 We don’t need Saudi oil. We needed Energy East and even if the costs would have been higher, at least we would be supporting Canadian resources and creating Canadian jobs. #ableg #cdnpoli
1639 2018-08-07 21:00:41 its a holistic treatment but with things like cancer,parkinsons,epilepsy and physical conditions etc then if cannabis oil works compared to legal pharma products then people should be allowed to use it legally,lifes depend on it
1640 2018-08-07 21:00:39 Look for higher oil prices and higher gas prices at the pump. Russia appreciates the added income, I’m sure.
1641 2018-08-07 21:00:37 Nows the time... let’s use our own oil!Quebec, you can have carbon tax and high gas prices... then let’s separate! By the way, give us our 50M back!
1642 2018-08-07 21:00:31 Driving Safety: Haven't changed your vehicle's oil since April? Why not make an appointment at the garage today!

1645 2018-08-07 21:00:17 August 07, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1646 2018-08-07 21:00:08 We produce more than we can use from what I've read so why are we even getting oil from them?
1647 2018-08-07 21:00:05 Real Risk analysis and any gap analysis in the Broomfield Extraction Oil and Gas CDP must be public! Hickenlooper, this is your state and it’s time it reflects transparency & local laws! @broomfield #broomfield #uphold301 @GovofCO #copolitics
1648 2018-08-07 21:00:04 avocado oil has a really high smoke point, has better fats, and makes you look cool to all the millennials
1649 2018-08-07 20:59:53 Coconut oil! It helps so much
1650 2018-08-07 20:59:52 One wonders if that Saudi comment was done intentionally? Maybe Trudeau is reinvesting in Canadian oil? Someone is going to get really rich again....courtesy of the Canadian Taxpayer!!
1651 2018-08-07 20:59:52 I want bushier eyebrows. Been using castor oil almost everyday. I wonder if there is anything better to use?
1652 2018-08-07 20:59:41 No fucking oil paint tomorrow cause i fisting y’all asses downnnnnn
1653 2018-08-07 20:59:24 The right decision imo. There is too many people out there that gain on Tesla going downhill. No matter if its shorts or oil industry. As a private company it will be more peaceful.
1654 2018-08-07 20:59:09 So, I bought a car from @GraysonBMW in May. They said it was inspected and that the oil had been changed. I get it home and in a week the service engine light comes on. I take it to have it inspected which cost me $100. They said that not only does it need $4,500 worth of things

1656 2018-08-07 20:59:06 I am trying out clary sage oil to help regulate periods . Not sure if its working yet
1657 2018-08-07 20:59:05 Serious mass. One scoop of that with pb olive oil and whole milk. Put weight on yah quick
1658 2018-08-07 20:58:45 The oil He wants women to oil the tough muscles in the birth canal oh mah gah.
1659 2018-08-07 20:58:34 i highly recommend trying coconut oil for extra dry cracky crappy itchy sandpaper skin- it has antibacterial & anti-inflammatory properties like olive oil
1660 2018-08-07 20:58:28 My dad gave me money to buy the oil for my car and when I went to go give him the change he said “no mami ve cómprate tu dutch” 
1661 2018-08-07 20:58:20 Do people actually get their oil changed every 3k miles like they’re supposed to??
1662 2018-08-07 20:58:05 Mane fuck it ima make it easy for my first time smoker too and just cop like 100 oil pens 
1663 2018-08-07 20:58:00 not saying I have a drug problem but sometimes I take algal oil supplements just for fun how’s that for a rebellion mum
1664 2018-08-07 20:57:57 i think oil will be the best realistic bc i dont think you can really get the small leaves with watercolor
1665 2018-08-07 20:57:49 Are you aware of anything outside your bubble?
Canada is an international laughing stock, money is being thrown at illegals while our own needy suffer, kneecapping our own resources while buying oil from Saudi Arabia
I don't have space to continue.
Wake up.
1666 2018-08-07 20:57:43 Wow!  Can’t wait to taste Kupljen Pumpkin Oil
1667 2018-08-07 20:57:43 Lol at this Saudi propaganda. Dudes, Twitter doesn't have enough characters to get into Saudi and its history of violations.

Re withdrawing students, petulant teenager move but hey maybe it'll be good in the long run considering the state of oil and Saudi's failure to diversify.
1668 2018-08-07 20:57:42 weird ... so they release a PR about it on 27th and comes on Website as dried flower week later. 

1) they need to complete 2 crops for sales license - they haven’t
2) there is also assets license for oil but that never gets posted either like the Seeds - starting material N/A
1669 2018-08-07 20:57:37 #NP Pour the Oil by Joshua Rodgers on #KRGN_985FM @thejoshuarogers
1670 2018-08-07 20:57:22 Crap. I clicked the wrong one. +1 for Begich. Walker should be allowed to keep doing what he has been doing. Hopefully there will be enough legislative turnover to pull the State's lips off the oil tit.
1671 2018-08-07 20:57:19 Oil or chalk? Oil are a bit like crayons, chalk ones I like to use quite violently. Dragging, scribbling .
1672 2018-08-07 20:57:14 All you Snowflake Socialist Democrats need to take a trip to the Oil Rich Country of Venezuela a Country who thought Socialism was a Good Idea. See how the people are eating dog food and dog's. And than come back and tell us all the positives of Socialism vs Capitalism. #StupidIs
1673 2018-08-07 20:57:12 Yes! He is hardly ever worried and hasn't had a fit in months! Even his obsessive thoughts are minimal. Plus, my Chihuahua had a bad seizure over the weekend and we gave him a dropper of CBD oil, and literally, they stopped in 15 seconds!
1674 2018-08-07 20:57:09 Worst oil change experience ever! @woodmansfood39 will definitely spread the word!
1675 2018-08-07 20:56:55 Just use olive oil for anything lower than frying temperature
1676 2018-08-07 20:56:46 The investments are not enough but I think many have decided to ignore it
1677 2018-08-07 20:56:46 Trade agreements specified what % would be paid in goods (like oil and East German radios and Romanian nose rings :-) and how much in hard currency. But over time the terms shifted in favour of hard currency and 'harder' commodities like oil, so Cuba could resell oil
1678 2018-08-07 20:56:45 then this means minimum wage of N65K is coming. Govt feels comfortable paying as crude oil now sells @ $74 we've borrowed enough
1679 2018-08-07 20:56:34 @realDonaldTrump "It's offical. The sake of our country and the way we can go about our lives in a orderly fashion is at stake. We are falling behind due to constantly buying Gas and Oil. We cant seem to get passed the fact we'd rather kill our earth rather than keep it alive."
1680 2018-08-07 20:56:32 Why are we importing oil!!
1681 2018-08-07 20:56:06 Aren’t the villains called “The Smokers” or something, and they cruise around smoking cigarettes on an old oil tanker?
1682 2018-08-07 20:55:59 Get the house sorted so everything easily accessible to avoid bending and do a good food shop to avoid stressing. Buy a pair of comfy slip on shoes with no laces and loose sweat pants so not to aggravate scar. Bio oil and a helping hand essential and download some good films 
1683 2018-08-07 20:55:50 Imagine rubbing her down with oil
1684 2018-08-07 20:55:42 Funny how this Trudeau Federal Liberals didn’t think of this? Humm..unless they are dead set to destroying our oil industry!
1685 2018-08-07 20:55:39 Spilled oil on myself @ work & i wasn’t tripping but my boss made a big deal  he made me go home and change all while being on the clock lmao
1686 2018-08-07 20:55:35 i think oil or watercolor will look beautiful
1687 2018-08-07 20:55:33 How we the People can change the world for the better for everyone everywhere? 1- protest and stop never ending war and never elect a pro war politician 2- protest and stop all nuclear weapons 3- protest and stop all oil and fracking pollution 4- protest and stop nuclear power
1688 2018-08-07 20:55:23 cooking experts: is olive oil bad for high temp cooking? if so, what are good substitutes?
1689 2018-08-07 20:55:10 1:- Sale Arms(to stabilise USA’s economy)
2:- overcome crises Of Oil(invade MidEst)
“necessity is the mother of invention“
Then bush came up with the zionistic idea of “War on terror” and targeted muslims, it was all planned.
it’s all politics, it has nothing to do with #islam
1690 2018-08-07 20:55:04 CBD oil and products? And then Free Bird? 
1691 2018-08-07 20:54:58 @DrmDnr sir, whether somebody has poured mustard oil in your both ears
1692 2018-08-07 20:54:51 Yeah I learned that y'all don't know about the ads haha but thank you for these great suggestions I'm going to try to salmon oil first and hopefully that works
1693 2018-08-07 20:54:48 That's sadly how the world works. The rich countries invade all the little countries for oil and opium while the poor in the world are manipulated and put to work everyday of thier life just to barely get by. In FACT, 1% of the world owns 99% of the world's money. The elite...
1694 2018-08-07 20:54:47 This lavender oil hurts my face. I hope it clears the acne marks.
1695 2018-08-07 20:54:32 @lilomatic , @GutuObert  and @DrThoko_Khupe were in the election to spoil it not to win. And now they are just oil to the rigging machine. We thank God for the death of their political careers.
1696 2018-08-07 20:54:23 Yeah, you're really commanding South Asia there.  How many hours did it take for the Indian Navy to destroy half of Pakistan's Navy and blow up the oil tanks?  Was it 12 or 24?
1697 2018-08-07 20:54:12 That's great. It's very positive to hear when animals left alone to minimal human interaction in these cases. It's the Palm oil industry that is the biggest threat to them in Borneo isn't it?
1698 2018-08-07 20:54:12 Oh boy that oil money gonna flow to the separatists movement lol.
1699 2018-08-07 20:54:04 Say the  the more they screamed Climate change the more money they go. Except for their pet projects. I was in Washington DC and met with the EPA The little grants  they gave to the environmentalist vs what they got was peanuts.  I work with Oil and Gas at the state level.
1700 2018-08-07 20:53:56 @radfast dissapointed you cant make infinite oil sources. i get why for "balance" reasons, but had an idea for a build that could have utilized black water. still great mod!
1701 2018-08-07 20:53:55 I've been trying CBD oil, daily for the last two weeks, but it's hard to tell if it's really working or not. I guess if I don't get any more migraines for the next month I'll call it a success.
1702 2018-08-07 20:53:55 I figure if they clean endangered birds that have been in an oil spill then it’s safe for this old dog
1703 2018-08-07 20:53:54 Chose to write about Nigeria and the issue of oil spills for my global health class, because why not learn more about my country right  Reading these journal articles are pissing me off. My people are literally dying because of carelessness and lack of government aide
1704 2018-08-07 20:53:48 Can @JustinTrudeau buy any oil from Iran after US sanctions? I guess Donald Trump will spank the butt of that feminist sissy hard. He wouldn’t even dare think of it
1705 2018-08-07 20:53:48 Hey @factnoopinion, I'm lmao thinking about what will happen to Saudi Arabia  when you run out of oil!
1706 2018-08-07 20:53:47 The sooner Donald Trump is removed from office, the better it will be for the world. He is nothing more than the equivalent of a nineteenth century snake oil carnival barker.
1707 2018-08-07 20:53:46 Castrol 'R' (road illegal) race motor oil added to high octane petrol and burnt by a full-throttle 1950's J.A.P engined speedway motorbike, mixed with newly dampened cinders thrown up by its spinning back wheel, as it hurtles past six feet away from my 10 yr old olfactory system.
1708 2018-08-07 20:53:43 OMG so I'm not a party girl and I say so on my profile. Just had someone turn up with THE WORST coke cock EVER!! FUMING. And he expected me to wank it for 2 hours with Coconut Oil!! I got him out after 45 mins and even gave him part of his money back. #Justno #EscortProbs
1709 2018-08-07 20:53:43 They are continuing to ship oil by rail carto Saint John.
1710 2018-08-07 20:53:40 Mum woz also locating live woodlice in the garage to feed it BOL! She was also bathing it's leg with lavender oil til it healed. Hoobruv was gutted when it was well enough to leave it's enclosure!
1711 2018-08-07 20:53:26 So, the knight-commander... Boiling in oil? That one never gets old.
1712 2018-08-07 20:53:26 มีอะไรก็บอกเลยนะอย่าให้รู้เอง
1713 2018-08-07 20:53:25 I shouldn't have to say this, but I'm going to anyway....
You don't have to like or agree with Alex Jones to see why completely censoring him from the internet is a bad thing. Y'all dumping oil down a slope already slippery but hey what do I know?
1714 2018-08-07 20:53:24 Lol. Nope, they're clearly not. It becomes the treasure for the Federal Government just like when an oil deposit is discovered on anyone's property, but the owner of the land will surely be compensated.
1715 2018-08-07 20:53:23 That moment when the biggest Oil Producer decides to invest in the Company leading the Electrical Car Movement through secondary buying!
#Interesting_Times ahead..
1716 2018-08-07 20:53:13 Your plan is hopelessly inadequate. Emissions being down is not enough. They have to stop and selling oil to other emitters counts against you. Btw have you noticed the fires in BC?
1717 2018-08-07 20:53:12 Confirmed by #IS-oil & #IS officers even operating in Turkish hotels near the border to #Syria.

Any idea where #AlBaghdadi is? In #Mossul? Or with "friends"?
1718 2018-08-07 20:53:10 The Saudi government is an oppressive dictatorship. This has been true for, like, forever, but the U.S. has maintained an alliance anyway. Because of the oil, and to sell them arms, among other reasons.
1719 2018-08-07 20:53:09 All that lovely cheap oil.
1720 2018-08-07 20:53:05 Joan Rivers: Our natures are a lot like oil, mix us with anything else, and we strive to swim on top. | #Quotes
1721 2018-08-07 20:52:55 Well the problem is, the sort of things that Jones put out there were slanderous and designed to inspire hatred and had next to zero vetting By responsible journalists or third parties. He was no better than a vile snake oil salesman
1722 2018-08-07 20:52:51 U sure about it?  Chaves was actually championed reliance on oil to implement Marxist state.  His economic war pushed millions to the extreme poverty. He died year before oil prices gone down, but nevertheless, this Marxist, not capitalism is responsible for hell they live in now
1723 2018-08-07 20:52:46 Omg you psychos! It’s my cup of tea  the honey and tea floaters make a weird oil residue on the top, it happens at home too 
1724 2018-08-07 20:52:44 We don't need Saudi Arabia. Just wait till your Oil dries up and it will. The only reason anyone pays attention to your shit countybis because of the Oil. If you didn't have that you'd still be living in the stone age.
1725 2018-08-07 20:52:38 Is a populist. Populism is snake oil based on market reactions. Progressivism is about moving social issues toward equity. Populism blames others for their ills. Progressivism is about responsible government. Populism is about stronger use of force. Progressivism is about 5/
1726 2018-08-07 20:52:30 My skin care routine:
1. Wash face with anti-acne soap (or facial scrub) bc I have oily skin
2. Toner (to get rid of the remaining gunk)
3. Moisturizer 
4. Argain oil (or serum) (for younger looking skin)
5. Sunscreen (only when I go out)
Bonus* castor oil for lashes and brows
1727 2018-08-07 20:52:29 And even more basic, what would they do with all the energy produced? It would cost them more than the oil based production. And it leaves them with a load of excess capacity.
1728 2018-08-07 20:52:27 I’m sure we will quit buying their oil too then.
1729 2018-08-07 20:52:27 The oil industry will die from a thousand little cuts. Not drowned to death at once in a vat of their own effluent.
1730 2018-08-07 20:52:24 Look at the gas produced in the quarter. I don’t see these wells names specifically.  I guess I will have to go find them and see if they made any oil.
1731 2018-08-07 20:52:15 برج الجديد .. المخابرات القديمه
1732 2018-08-07 20:52:08 rub peppermint oil on your temples & behind/under your ears
1733 2018-08-07 20:52:04 All that oil and money but they sure are sensitive.
1734 2018-08-07 20:52:02 That’s the sick part of this. I say screw the Saudis and their oil. Build more pipelines in Canada. It’s perverse that we don’t even use our own oil. Trudeau is a complete hypocrite.
1735 2018-08-07 20:52:00 We don't decide (or even know) what ads go on our videos. I've never used it before, but you can try sardine or salmon oil, coconut oil, raw goats milk (Primal or Answers), or Missing Link Pet Kelp Skin and Coat! All of them are natural choices and will help with dry skin!
1736 2018-08-07 20:51:59 F A L S E
1737 2018-08-07 20:51:53 No you'll pay more taxes in Canada. You need to go to the Middle East where they fully fund their governments on oil sales.
1738 2018-08-07 20:51:53 おはよう！早起きだぁぁ！！

順調に進んでいる玉楼弐！

連覇も今日から頑張るぞ！！
1739 2018-08-07 20:51:49 It’s well-documented who uses their $ for good and who on themselves. I don’t think Trump‘s giant oil painting of himself, paid for by his charity, counts. I don’t think the yachts count. Notice it’s not usually the Democrats who own those. We are obviously do not share values.
1740 2018-08-07 20:51:46 Man you're gonna have to sell so much more of that lead tainted snake oil to cover costs. huh, you UK white nationalist and snake oil salesman. Fear is big business after all.
1741 2018-08-07 20:51:44 North Sea Oil By Northwest
1742 2018-08-07 20:51:40 Ehh, it will be one less distraction, and I’m for it, but it isn’t going to fix the FUD from other automakers or the oil companies. It just won’t matter as much anymore.
1743 2018-08-07 20:51:39 Fast Fashion is the SECOND Biggest polluter of our environment, just next to OIL. We fund this dirty industry by carelessly shopping in their stores. In this day and age of heatwaves and drastic weather conditions, let's help the earth by making more informed decisions.

1746 2018-08-07 20:51:13 i just wanna,,, give bakugo some chamomile tea,, maybe a cooling sheet mask,,, some lavender essential oil,,, have him do some breathing exercises,, talk things out nd just get him to calm the fuck down
1747 2018-08-07 20:51:09 Are we surprised though? The US and UK would choose to support countries for the sake of oil and their opposition to Iran rather than moral decency and human rights.
1748 2018-08-07 20:50:54 make the olive oil cake permanent! one of your best pastries!!

1751 2018-08-07 20:50:16 Jonnie is such a happy smiley boy. He is so dorky I love him.
1752 2018-08-07 20:49:56 Or, alternately, there's money and power in rigging elections and selling snake oil and the other bullshit is cover.
1753 2018-08-07 20:49:54 いやっふぅーーーー(*´꒳`*)
1754 2018-08-07 20:49:53 So get your legs out and vests on, fuck sun screen because global warming will kill us all (especially in Norwich) before skin cancer does. In fact, splash some carrot oil on. Enjoy it.
1755 2018-08-07 20:49:39 Did the leftover beard oil make it glisten?
1756 2018-08-07 20:49:38 just got an oil and air filter change on sherane (my car) plus some a/c WOOO we new bitches

1758 2018-08-07 20:49:37 I would like us to be clear of their business  and stop buying oil from them. Just another shithole Middle East country. As for Trudeau, this will not work for him. People know he favours Islam.
1759 2018-08-07 20:49:33 you smell good what oil is that? something from bath & body! It's notyou're gonna be in there smelling all day long
1760 2018-08-07 20:49:31  Mine filled the bathtub with rose petals, bubbles and essential oil one year. I slipped and dislocated my shoulder and the bathroom was still a mess a few days later.  I begged him not to do that again. Nothing says romantic like pain killers and cleaning. 
1761 2018-08-07 20:49:12 No OIL, No LIFE!!!
1762 2018-08-07 20:49:10 ...like Carotone or Epiderm ir Choco cream and soap. Alternatively, there are homemade face scrubs you can use to help glow up and smoothen your skin, like lemon+honey+sugar scrub, soda+coconut oil scrub, etc
1763 2018-08-07 20:49:06 Who NEEDS Canada? Saudia certainly does NOT; BUT Canada "needs" cheap oil on "credit" which comes daily to Nova Scotia & PEI from Saudis. Trudeau kiss cheap oil bye & pay thru ur nose & bones as gas will now cost canadians arm & leg!!! Will Trump give Trudeau gas?
1764 2018-08-07 20:48:51 What massive oil fields?
1765 2018-08-07 20:48:50 I ordered an entire skin care routine and it gets here Thursday. Trying a more natural approach with tea tree oil for getting rid of my cystic acne because OTC medicated stuff doesn't work anymore.

1767 2018-08-07 20:48:44 Now there’s a thing - I just assumed you’d crack the egg in the oil, but you have a point. @paletteandgun can you enlighten your eggy disciples? 
1768 2018-08-07 20:48:40 @JulepBeauty Hi! I have a bottle of your radiance oil and I used it 4 times just to have it leak out! Who can I contact? Can I get an email address? :( I am so disappointed!
1769 2018-08-07 20:48:38 Not sure Canada should invest that in this Badawi drama but to be lectured by the KSA is ridiculous..hey assholes ...we have our own oil thank you very much ..and fewer flights from your nations airline is just less jihadis landing on our soil

1773 2018-08-07 20:48:15 Replace with Canadian Oil.. It is insane that we would buy from other countries when we have our own oil
1774 2018-08-07 20:48:10 Thankfully you wont be "studying abroad" here any time soon. Here's hoping you never come back! Go pollute other countries with your terrorism and human rights abuses. You live in a corrupt country. The clock is ticking on your oil. 
1775 2018-08-07 20:48:01 I’ve been buying my Rosehip Oil in The Ordinary but I am a #Revoholic so definitely i will divorce with them ,  eagerly looking forward to it, yasss! 
1776 2018-08-07 20:47:48 Depending on what I said, you could go for either cocoa butter, shea butter, coconut oil and other natural creams if, say, your skin is dehydrated or needs a glow or sumn. But maybe if you have blemishes like pimples and dark spots you wanna get rid of, you could try correctors-1
1777 2018-08-07 20:47:40 The process has become less expensive and easier to do in the last 50 years. Currently it's is profitable to pull and refine at current oil prices. Not only does Canada huge reserves of it but so does the U.S. and Venezuela. Cleary it is a viable long term solution.

1873 2018-08-07 20:38:38 Yes. MBS is Saudi WF, not bonds. Others too. A syndicate of oil money, Chinese, tech investors.

1904 2018-08-07 20:35:15 "should we maybe put a little olive oil in--"
"i say nooooooooooo" (deeply)
1905 2018-08-07 20:35:07 Back in the days when being a fine guy with good cologne was enough to get you any chic you pull-up on. Now they find a steering wheel more good looking and the smell of engine oil more pleasant. Sigh 
1906 2018-08-07 20:35:05 Signed up!
Also, signed myself as a Greenpeace volunteer last month!
Currently going for the Amazon Rainforest and its coral reef conservation, against oil drilling! Excited to feel like a part of something that's fighting for the good!

1909 2018-08-07 20:34:51 Non-GMO project = modern day snake oil, fear profiteering. Shame Nestle feels need to market GM-free products, but that's their right as long as they do it truthfully  and without misleading people that it's any different from foods with GE ingredients.
1910 2018-08-07 20:34:48 I wouldn't say the same, plus look at the forum / feedback page, blurry close to objects photos, oil painting effect and much more...Great performance but I'm disappointed in camera.

1912 2018-08-07 20:34:41 Just like there is nothing liberal in Liberal National Party. Snake oil applied to the cover they use.  #auspol
1913 2018-08-07 20:34:41 I went home and got a cut last yr nigga charged me 25 dollars. I can get an oil change cheaper than that.

1920 2018-08-07 20:33:57 Stop buying Saudi oil and stop giving Palestinians money. Build a pipeline to the east and use Canadian oil. Use the money in Canada!

1924 2018-08-07 20:33:45 I like to add roasted garlic and lots of smoked paprika and cumin. It gets smoother in the blender than the food processor. Be sure to cook your chickpeas long enough and don’t skimp on olive oil or lemon juice.
1925 2018-08-07 20:33:37 Tea tree oil with 100% natural ingredients!
1926 2018-08-07 20:33:33 This is Saudi Arabia, which fights terrorism and helps the weak. Islam is a religion of tolerance and love. Saudi Arabia is not what you think is oil and money, it is the strategic depth of the Islamic world
1927 2018-08-07 20:33:30 We have 3d largest oil reserve and the DUMBEST prime minister in the world!

1932 2018-08-07 20:32:34 Yeah it's a whole line of they have for African black soap! but I found this cream a couple months ago & best thing ever. It helps too not add on more oil to your face even if you sweat, helps with breakouts after you wash your face, lightweight. It's really good!
1933 2018-08-07 20:32:25 An oil change should not take 6+ hours.
1934 2018-08-07 20:32:11 I think trump's vision of a great America is oil fields, landscapes razed and wildlife removed for logging and agribusiness. Only green spaces are golf courses. They don't care about consequences because they won't be alive then. 
And rich will have protected spaces.
1935 2018-08-07 20:32:10 Is my dream to work for Tesla as Brand Promoter in W/Africa, I talk about Tesla to my participants and anybody who cares with regards to the EV revolution is introducing into automobile, & how it has potential to liquidate my Country mono economy and only source of income, oil.

1942 2018-08-07 20:31:06 That is not even what we are discussing here. Islam is a conservative religion. Period. On the other side of debate who supports Islam more I would say ppl like trump investing into saudi/turkey/indonesia. Then ppl like bush doing oil contracts then ppl like Cheney arming them.
1943 2018-08-07 20:31:06 Onshore #naturalgas would be cleaner than oil, would employ Nova Scotians and grow our economy. If we also used it to replace imported coal we could really make a difference by cutting our CO2 emissions in half.
1944 2018-08-07 20:31:00 The government of Brazil has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Adam Sandler in a shweshwe wig.
1945 2018-08-07 20:30:56 True--I remember my dentist talking about pipeline MLPs in mid-2014 (right after I sold all of mine). When I told him I sold all of mine and that they're ultimately impacted by oil prices (contrary to prevailing narrative) and were at frothy valuations, he said "uh-oh".
1946 2018-08-07 20:30:44 Demand will fall,,This is why oil is being nationalized around the world,,Long term for oil is downward,,Energy will rise
1947 2018-08-07 20:30:43 Bring da oil 
1948 2018-08-07 20:30:42 Litte fact.....Oil Can lives in EP.....see him at the local bar at least a couple times a month...... always will talk baseball with you at the bar....real cool guy.....How’s that for ya #RhodeIslandTypical
1949 2018-08-07 20:30:41 It doesn’t even look like an ugly junker that leaks oil everywhere.
1950 2018-08-07 20:30:37 A bit ironic that the largest oil producer and manipulator of oil prices has a big stake in one of the leading electric car manufacturers. I'm all for diversification, but I'm not sure I trust there won't be subversion.

1952 2018-08-07 20:30:27 Personally, I prefer my olive oil to be a little 'slutty'. A virgin doesn't know what they're doing as it is, what the hell’s an EXTRA virgin going to do? Play ‘Grand Theft Auto’ with my bruschetta?
1953 2018-08-07 20:30:25 @RehamKhan1 Reham jee.  What do you think of the possibility of a huge oil reserve in the midst of being discovered near the Iran border to Pakistan.If oil is found we are looking at billions of barrels.  Will Imran Khan be able to capitalise and make Pakistan a 1st World Country
1954 2018-08-07 20:30:18 The only thing I would give Azan is a damn perm and some oil for that dry ass hair. he looks like trying to use somebody with that nappy ass hair. He ought to be USEing some luster's pink oil.
1955 2018-08-07 20:30:05 You're not a human rights guy I see, George. Do you realize the federal gov't doesn't buy oil?

1957 2018-08-07 20:30:02 This Gist this night sef. Lemme go and look for anointing oil this night. Anoint myself before entering any taxi tommorrow.
1958 2018-08-07 20:29:47 I wouldn't say the same, plus look at the forum / feedback page, blurry close to objects photos, oil painting effect and much more...Great performance but I'm disappointed in camera.
1959 2018-08-07 20:29:37 Saudi paired trade...small hedge against oil...pocket change.
1960 2018-08-07 20:29:27 To be fair Man City and most of the Arab owned teams are more for diversifying investments away from oil, PR a bonus.

BTW, no one would be complaining about Kronke if he was not American.....
1961 2018-08-07 20:29:21 yes,if i child is having 100 life threatening epileptic fits per week and by simply letting them take cannabis oil reduces it by 90 percent then its a no brainer? 
thats after the parents tried every thing the pharma companies had to offer
1962 2018-08-07 20:29:14 Yes sir... you prefer oil based?
1963 2018-08-07 20:29:06 Valvoline oil change is lit af! The guy who helped me literally gave me a $20 off discount 
1964 2018-08-07 20:28:57 @RamTrucksCanada so my oil life monitor says I’m at 65%. It has been over a year since my last synthetic oil change. Only 4K klm since then. Read one FB post by Ram Canada said go by the monitor. Dealer says every 6 mos or 8K klm. Who is right?
1965 2018-08-07 20:28:50 Clary sage essential oil is one oil I respect
1966 2018-08-07 20:28:45 i’ll check them out! i’m new to trying cbd so i just have oil 
1967 2018-08-07 20:28:37 You continue to argue about the parameters.

I’m willing to show numbers showing immediately implementable societal changes can reduce refined liquid fossil fuel consumption in the GVRD sufficiently that, absent exports, no expansions of pipelines or oil by rail is required.
1968 2018-08-07 20:28:33 How could rats eat dey pepper and vegetable oil?? What kind of therapy is that???? Tomorrow I will leave Maggi on the table. Sheybi you want to prepare spiritual stew. #ratsaremad

1972 2018-08-07 20:27:49 Man I love taking naps with indie music playing and my oil difusser on .
1973 2018-08-07 20:27:45 i got my oil checked in my car bc the check message was coming on but the people set my mph to kmph so i'm just out here driving like im in canada again
1974 2018-08-07 20:27:29 No one probably remembers the news from before the election, except maybe @zerohedge who posted it

Saudi Soveign Fund sold a lot of US Stock.

Then oil went back up too!

They got money to burn, to burn shorts now. Watch for more!

1977 2018-08-07 20:27:14 Canada, I just spent a week in a chalet in Switzerland, a “Swiss Chalet” if you will, and not once did anyone roast any poultry, make a seasoned oil and water sauce, or produce a festive special. I am beginning to think our national myths are bullshit.
1978 2018-08-07 20:27:13 Chuck is nothing more than a snake oil salesmen
1979 2018-08-07 20:27:05 Took five hours to get my oil change, but I only paid $20 with a coupon!
1980 2018-08-07 20:27:03 the first time i cut all my hair off i put coconut oil in it like twice and my hair grew like cray
1981 2018-08-07 20:27:01 The base is always the same but you can vary flavour heaps:
Oil in a decent sized pot. 2 heaped tsp of beef stock powder, 1/2-1 tsp cayenne, 2 tsp paprika, 2 tsp garlic paste, 1 tsp chilli paste, 1-2 tsp tomato paste, Fry off til oil separates...
1982 2018-08-07 20:26:44 Correction: about 10% of the total imports to Canada are from Saudi but the total percentage used by Canadians would be far less since many of our oil needs are met with domestic supply. 
We use 2.4M barrels per day and import less than 1M, and 100K is from Saudi

So,... 4%
1983 2018-08-07 20:26:44 i just bought jamaican black castor oil to give some life to my edges, but there's a small chance that i am actually allergic to it... and i laughed so hard because i was like Jan... you see this is what happens when you stray from your 2 product life
1984 2018-08-07 20:26:43 Don't we need to consider the exports and imports?  If we stop importing, how will nations respond to purchasing our oil?
1985 2018-08-07 20:26:40 Says a lot about what (or who) Ryan considers a "tragedy". I would have included 5000 Puerto Ricans, racists killing with impunity, trans kids isolated at school & locked-up babies. Plus asbestos and chemicals poisoning us and oil drilling scarring our parks.

Ok, Paul 
1986 2018-08-07 20:26:25 Quant à l'effondrement énergétique, je m'en voudrais de paraître iconoclaste mais j'attends avec impatience le peak oil depuis qu'il a été prédit en 1970. Ajusté par l'inflation le baril était moins cher l'an dernier qu'AVANT le choc pétrolier de 1973.
1987 2018-08-07 20:26:16 Well then let's choose human rights, stop dealing with Saudi Arabia, and start using our own oil.
1988 2018-08-07 20:26:06 I am thinking a huge draw , what do you think?
1989 2018-08-07 20:26:02 To protect US oil companies sending middle eastern oil to Europe using mostly  migrant Indian/Bangladeshi labor while keeping profits offshore.

Oh and to give huge rebuilding contracts to  politically friendly US corporations.

Corporate welfare at taxpayer expense! As you know!
1990 2018-08-07 20:25:56 Eastern Canada loves dirty oil shipped up the St Lawrence.
Bizarre.
1991 2018-08-07 20:25:54 Such a one variable view; blame a politician.  US fracking and Iran coming in stream causing a glut in oil.  Many other variables making Alberta oil easier to down bid.
1992 2018-08-07 20:25:53 But I do know about electric cars and I know you want to drive one.  I also know about solar power and so do not need to resort to burning oil to drive my car.  I know that pure capitalism is flawed with perspective to life and energy and what actually creates capitol.
1993 2018-08-07 20:25:43 Coconut oil and leave in
1994 2018-08-07 20:25:41 Oil fields?

1996 2018-08-07 20:25:34 I think it’s government overreach to ban the sale of snake oil.
1997 2018-08-07 20:25:32 Sanctions on Iran again . With trading pact of Iran turkey China Russia do you think Iran cares. Bad move trump. Euro zone lose big time
1998 2018-08-07 20:25:26 JUST BECAUSE IM A GIRL DOESNT MEAN YOU CAN TRICK ME INTO BUYING TIRES MR. MECHANIC JUST CHANGE MY OIL AND LEAVE ME ALONE
1999 2018-08-07 20:25:25 "Snakier oil" is a great expression!
2000 2018-08-07 20:25:19 I think we'll see that as the tariffs begin to bite and Iran oil stops.
2001 2018-08-07 20:25:12 PSA: If you're buying amd or trying to sell the thc oil cartridges why dnt you make sure it hasnt been used bc all you mfs buy them used ass ones out here. If it has an air bubble it HAS definitely been puffed on already
2002 2018-08-07 20:25:11 Oil prices up due to your Iran actions. Good for Putin and Russia; not so much for anyone in US who needs to drive or heat their house. But you showed us who's side you're on in Helsinki. No surprise. #TraitorTrump #IranSanctions #Iran
2003 2018-08-07 20:25:09 Lmao.. Af cause I be taking medicine. Older people will be like "just get that healing oil and pray, you'll be alright"

2008 2018-08-07 20:24:35 Data is the oil and AI (arguably algorithm) is just the refinery. 

Oil without refinery is valuable but refinery without oil is nothing.

2012 2018-08-07 20:24:23 Big oil profits = Big GOP donations 

It does nothing for the air you breath and your grandchildren who die of respiratory diseases.  But hey, a buck’s a buck, right?

2017 2018-08-07 20:23:59 I'm not changing the topic. The @TransMtn carries both refined fuels and crude oil and the new pipeline will be used for both as well. This is you changing the topic. Show us how we can significantly reduce our use of liquid fuels. That is what you promised you would do.
2018 2018-08-07 20:23:49 when that dueling guild is open i'm gonna have so much frost oil on my axe for you
2019 2018-08-07 20:23:31 Saudis or some other ME oil fund?
2020 2018-08-07 20:23:29 You could have a sensor problem or an oil pressure leak.

2022 2018-08-07 20:23:26 Coconut oil can be used for literally anything, cooking fried foods, lotion, hair oil, toothpaste, blood cleanser, the whole nine
2023 2018-08-07 20:22:50 I think the more you strip it the more it will try to make up for the moisture loss and create more oil and clogs
2024 2018-08-07 20:22:34 Yeah, but as a technology has gotten better, prices have gone down. They are coming up with batteries to store renewable energy. So eventually there will be no need for any subsidy. I don’t think there are subsidies right now. The change will bring more money than oil or Coal
2025 2018-08-07 20:22:22 Well seeing we have managed to piss off a bunch of Middle East countries, run by dictators, maybe we should get our shit together and do Energy East. They have quit buying our grains maybe we should quit importing their bloody oil.
2026 2018-08-07 20:22:21 @POTUS PRESIDENT TRUMP, PLEASE PUSH THROUGH AN OIL REFINERY AT THE SOUTHERN END OF THE ALASKA PIPELINE FOR AND ‘VALUE ADDED’ COMMODITY TO CREATE JOBS AND KEEP MORE MONEY HERE AT HOME !!!
2027 2018-08-07 20:22:20 Yeahhhh shit oil paints are hard and this is only my third painting with oil paints. Thank you so much oh my gosh!
2028 2018-08-07 20:22:13 Do you think we've seen the full extent of human stubbornness and pride in Satan's goat nature yet? Get really into the fresh oil today to avoid that mess.
2029 2018-08-07 20:22:06 when I was making dinner I'd only been cooking for less than 30 seconds when a moth flew in front of me and landed directly in the oil in the hot frying pan
I still feel bad for both the stupid moth itself and the food it forced me to throw away

2036 2018-08-07 20:21:28 And thanks to Justin Trudeau’s pipeline policies Canada cannot supply Atlantic Canada with Canadian oil. We can only buy foreign oil. Nice job Ottawa!
2037 2018-08-07 20:21:24 Seems someone didn’t bother to do any research, we have an abundance of oil here in Newfoundland alone , let alone what Alberta has...Canada will be just fine.
2038 2018-08-07 20:21:07 @kalilahrey made a good point this morning regarding the oil hedge and SCT. I didn't remember. The @jlpjamaica said in its 10 point plan that it would steer the oil hedge towards funding $1.5 threshold. Sincerely forgot that.
2039 2018-08-07 20:21:07 Front seal bad. Oil pain gasket bad. O2 sensor bad. Replace belt. $1000.

2 pounds of Freon - $200

Ouch. Feels like a Monday.
2040 2018-08-07 20:21:06 On balance, this doesn’t seem any weirder than hiring a bald pasty Australian guy to shill for the oil and gas industry. #justsaying #copolitics

2046 2018-08-07 20:20:37 The check engine, change oil, and low fuel lights are all on in my car because I like to live on the edge
2047 2018-08-07 20:20:37 No, it's in line w all T's policies. Up car emissions, mfrs dumping waste in rivers, drilling off coast lines, reducing endangered specie prtctns, allowing bee-killing pesticides, letting hunters bait/shoot bear moms & cubs IN their dens, letting Big Oil drill our natl parklands.
2048 2018-08-07 20:20:24 and the most ridiculous is where's the money? Such projects usually just PR, only politics to "get influence" in countries for KGB. During Putin's ruling $4 trillions from oil vanished, federal budget illegally financing Prigozhin terrorist which almost get Ebola samples in Congo
2049 2018-08-07 20:20:19 For the first time in my life i have gotten on amazon and not binge bought pocket pussies and olive oil.
2050 2018-08-07 20:20:14 Sanchez SN, a former superstar,  just dropped nearly 30%in one day!!! It is down over 90% in three years. The business model of overproducing and selling way below cost at hedged prices simply cannot work - even at 70 oil.
2051 2018-08-07 20:20:13 WAIITTTTT YOU USED OIL PAINTS? THAT'S THE HARDEST THING TO WORK WITH!! OMG YOU KILLED ITTT
2052 2018-08-07 20:20:04 Not quite sure how to check your oil? Don't worry. Here's a quick tutorial. #themoreyouknow
2053 2018-08-07 20:19:47 Get that Energy East Pipeline built.   Build some Cdn refineries, get the oil to the refineries in Montreal and N.B..   then tell the Saudis to keep their goddam oil
2054 2018-08-07 20:19:46 Not me black people don't need no baby oil lol it automatic
2055 2018-08-07 20:19:41 The Puget Sound has 630,000 b/d of refining capacity for which they need a steady supply of crude oil. It used to come via tanker from Alaska (91% in 2003) and Trans Mountain (9% in 2003), now it increasingly coming from Saudi/Russian etc... tankers and oil-by-rail
2056 2018-08-07 20:19:38 Can I get some olive oil Juul pods
2057 2018-08-07 20:19:37 I think I'm out of olive oil doe
2058 2018-08-07 20:19:37 They definitely help. Some people are sensitive and need to mix with a carrier oil like coconut oil. Personally they don’t bother me. Definitely help my feet.
2059 2018-08-07 20:19:22 It’s not Billy-Bob’s Chat Forum. It’s the Standard Oil of that online product.
2060 2018-08-07 20:19:20 Make sure that ur extra active.Start using oil between d virginal passage &anus to avoid tearing. In labour keep walking as much as possible &try to stay up right. Choose the best hospital possible. Women get pregnant and get lazy or think I’m skinny so I’m ok. No It’s a marathon
2061 2018-08-07 20:19:17 @ImranKhanPTI don't worry about nab they  been sleeping for 25 years & just woken up. you need helicopters,jets bullet proof cars call me
2062 2018-08-07 20:19:10 You are playing fast and loose with your numbers, mixing crude oil numbers with refined fuels numbers, and being unclear with what geographic region you are referring to.

And I literally *just* called out your numbers as being suspect.

You do not engage in good faith.
2063 2018-08-07 20:19:00 全ての料理はオイルなしに作れない…(作れるのもあるかも、え、あるのかなぁ)
2064 2018-08-07 20:18:45 Can't see OIL...
2065 2018-08-07 20:18:38 Please read up on the Energy East pipeline. It was an export pipeline. It would not have displaced any oil imports.

There are no refineries equipped to handle bitumen in eastern Canada.

Perhaps insread ask why Nfld oil goes to the US and not to eastern Canada?
2066 2018-08-07 20:18:37 The flame you see coming out of oil refineries. I can't remember the amount that is lost each day currently per refinery but its huge
2067 2018-08-07 20:18:34 Sorry you were alarmed, Diana! What you're seeing is a mixture of crumbs and oil that sometimes forms in the package and is not peanut based. Please DM us the package UPC, along with the expiration date and the letters and numbers that follow? Thanks!
2068 2018-08-07 20:18:32 Funny that... want to see what 40+ years of Oil Bonanza looks like when we stay in Union with England? Oh yeh, £1.6 Trillion National debt, no infrastructure upgrades in Scotland, and if it helps...have a look at #govanhill today.

2072 2018-08-07 20:18:15 No need. With shale oil and fracking moving full speed ahead under Trump, America is increasingly less reliant on foreign oil.
2073 2018-08-07 20:18:10 Got my baby an oil change for the trip 
2074 2018-08-07 20:18:09 Dear @POTUS Why are you allowing this election meddling by Zuckerberg? Why isn't FB being broken up as standard oil was? Mid-terms are here!
2075 2018-08-07 20:17:46 i'm half awake but i got mad that xc gives you swim lotion made of mechon oil and doesn't let you put it on the robot
2076 2018-08-07 20:17:34 Huh. Fifteen years ago it was "No blood for oil!"

Professional malcontents are best ignored; it's attention they crave. If they become overly rowdy, turn the hose on them.
2077 2018-08-07 20:17:20 The one you wipe off with baby oil on god
2078 2018-08-07 20:17:06 No we now buy oil from them.

2080 2018-08-07 20:17:01 With the exception of oil/gas and those little dolls Russia makes nothing the world wants. Russia is a paranoid and psychotic country that will stab it's neighbor or friend in the back just because it's their nature.

2084 2018-08-07 20:16:36 But that would increase our EMISSIONS!!!

Trudeau has both pooched a reliable source of cheap oil, AND our ability to replace it with domestic product. It takes real talent to double-hamstring yourself like that, but Boy Blunder managed it in one term, with a year still to go.
2085 2018-08-07 20:16:35 Pakistan election commission is f ing stupid. How many recounts are they going to do? Imran Khan won accept it
2086 2018-08-07 20:16:33 Bob, the record shows that Canada sells SA military equipment and buys billion$ of their oil.  If Canada doesn’t cease this activity in light of the recent Saudi actions, then Canada will be enabling SA to do whatever they want.  C’mon, you’re smarter than that.
2087 2018-08-07 20:16:21 So why are we paying unnecessary Adnin fees of Millions to this outfit? We had the BEST scientists directly funded through the public service. Many of the directors in the GBRF would seem to want the Reef to die so that they can exploit the underlying oil reserves. Conflict much?
2088 2018-08-07 20:16:04 Try owning a Prius! In addition to the gigantic batteries, it has a 3 cylinder engine. I have yet to find a chain oil service for under $75.00. RIPOFF
2089 2018-08-07 20:16:00 They ain’t sayin nothin slick to a can of oil.......
2090 2018-08-07 20:15:42 We have plenty of oil here just off the east coast. But all that gets shipped away to the US after it's loaded on tankers. Same thing happened on the Grand Banks here many years ago with another local product we like to call cod.
2091 2018-08-07 20:15:24 Look at Iraq.  Did gas prices go down because we stole all that oil?  No, the oil companies just got richer.  We as citizens NEVER benefit.  We only get tasked with fighting and dying for the right for rich people to get even more wealthy.
2092 2018-08-07 20:15:10 Whether you need an oil change, tune up, or engine work, we have a mechanic that can get your boat or jet ski back in mint condition. Call @BurrsYachtHaven 860-443-8457 for a price quote!
2093 2018-08-07 20:14:48 But Rex was there for only one purpose. $1/2 Tr. oil deal through Crimean Port. He was put in solely for that purpose. When Congress tied Trump's hands w/sanctions his value plummeted. Romney was displayed as eye candy but Tillerson & his medal of friendship was always the one.

2095 2018-08-07 20:14:32 No, no reason to. I can't lose significant $$$. I've made half of what I am down in $TSLA just trading #Crude oil. It is not significant. LOL. People are idiots. My credo always is manage risk. And part of that is sizing positions.
2096 2018-08-07 20:14:32 One common refrain that I get from local Govs when I propose new approaches on transport/emissions is that "if we do that, we will get sued by big oil/big auto/big aviation/big whatever... and that's really expensive."

2099 2018-08-07 20:14:13 @WBrettWilson I'd follow the money. Who gains/loses. Try this: US and KSA sell oil to China. China slaps tariffs on US oil. US needs new market. US asks KSA for help. KSA uses random tweet as excuse to stop trade w/Cda. US fills import gap with more oil to Cda. KSA sells to China
2100 2018-08-07 20:14:13 Cures tooth decay, soothes dry throat, kills bad breath, whitens teeth, heals bleeding gums, heals cracked lips ---> these are just a few of the benefits of oil pulling, a natural alternative to the harsh chemicals found in most mouthwash. #oilpulling #oralhealth #naturalremedies

2103 2018-08-07 20:14:05 Not many know, but we only use about 40 percent of our own oil, and export rest, but buy Arab oil.
It's been like that for years.
2104 2018-08-07 20:13:56 Weigh up the money that WM has had over the many years of draining Scotland OIL, where is that money now??????????????? It's definitely not in Scotland @ScotTories @Scotland_future @IsThisAB0t @YesDayScotland @WingsScotland
2105 2018-08-07 20:13:52 Do you let potential buyers know about mega oil & gas fracking pad plans proposed for neighborhoods affected so that potential buyers can make educated decisions based on health, safety and quality of life needs?
2106 2018-08-07 20:13:51 Back in the days of photo film and prints, I knew that technical knowledge was the undeniable foundation of any art I achieved.

2110 2018-08-07 20:13:12 Just did a hair mask with benonite clay, coconut oil, water, and Jamaican black castor oil. Hunny. I ain’t never seen my hair this defined and soft in my life.
2111 2018-08-07 20:13:09 Don’t be a dumb bitch just driving a damn car. Know your mileage, know when to change your oil, how to check you thread count on your tires, shit know how many miles are on your car
2112 2018-08-07 20:13:06 I think Trump invested in Putin's oil sell-off & plans ti profit biggly
2113 2018-08-07 20:12:37 If we developed our own domestic oil industry it would completely overshadow any economic losses due to troubled relations with the KSA.
2114 2018-08-07 20:12:31 how I would love Chelsea to lose their oil money and mean nothing anymore like the past
2115 2018-08-07 20:12:29 Spritz with oil and bake at 220°c until crispy. Season afterwards, not before. Salt will draw out moisture whilst cooking and leave them soggy.
2116 2018-08-07 20:12:23 @RealJamesWoods  Not even sure if you will see this, but my friend was given 3 months to live from stomach cancer, long to short, he was cured from a high alkali diet and mainly cannabis oil CBD oil.

2122 2018-08-07 20:12:00 approx 10%. 
First question question answered

It isn't easier to move Saudi oil. Canada exports about 4000% more oil than it imports from Saudi.
Second Question answered

Anymore misleading/stupid questions?
2123 2018-08-07 20:12:00 LOL except only Eastern Provinces buy their oil.
2124 2018-08-07 20:11:59 No, I don't. English companies own much of the oil and will get a favorable apportionment, not to mention that oil prices are not...
2125 2018-08-07 20:11:57 Maybe try essential oil of peppermint, if you can get some good therapeutic grade oil (not cut with alcohol or anything nasty).
2126 2018-08-07 20:11:52 But if you want a more filling and savory healthy route, steam chicken thighs or steam salmon fillets (with a little olive oil) with salt pepper seasoning, and boiled broccoli.
2127 2018-08-07 20:11:42 It is incredible how stupid people have become in the last few years. Led by a Pied Piper with snake oil. Truly amazing
2128 2018-08-07 20:11:31 So big tech is the new Standard Oil. We know what has to be done.
2129 2018-08-07 20:11:22 I think oil production needs to be increased by US sanctions on Iran
2130 2018-08-07 20:11:19 Oil pre heating rather than an oil cooler. He may be on to something...

2141 2018-08-07 20:10:08 Oil producing countries hope you are thinking outside the box like the slogan of 9ja when it was in recession of which a big recession is looming at the front

2143 2018-08-07 20:09:59 If we are talking about the present time then I think I did mention the underperforming state of the Scottish economy, however wouldn't you say for example that the whisky industry, oil, energy production and water are just some areas of strength?
2144 2018-08-07 20:09:57 Wouldn't watch this trash if you offered me a lifetime supply of hot bean water and rigged oil and gas leases.
2145 2018-08-07 20:09:55 And oil
2146 2018-08-07 20:09:55 Lamp oil, rope, bombs! You want it? It's yours, my friend, as long as you have enough rubies!

2148 2018-08-07 20:09:42 2 chk breast sliced fine, fry in oil 5 mins, add sugar snaps, sliced onions, sweetcorn, sliced chillies fry 4 mins. 4 tbs Miso paste, 500ml boiling water. Mix thoroughly. It can be a bugger. Add chk/veg and udon noodles to miso. Don't boil! Heat for 5 mins. Enjoy!
2149 2018-08-07 20:09:29 Money obtain from the oil Russia has will be used to buy ballistic missiles to aim at the United States. None of that money will go to the Russian people. Putin and his world wide cadre of oligarchs will use all means necessary to maintain power. If they have to buy a president
2150 2018-08-07 20:09:26 A good investment: wallflowers from bath and body works... btw the pumpkin apple oil is bomb
2151 2018-08-07 20:09:24 And some of the people claiming to inform you are snake oil salesmen like Andrew Wakefield
2152 2018-08-07 20:09:22 You mean Hopper and his clowns that tried run an oil company?  Failure. Did not work. Govt sold out.

2159 2018-08-07 20:08:53 $SPWH Total sales increased by 14% in Q1, and it's trading less than 7x forward and 0.25x sales. Camping/hunting stuff can be heavily cyclical, and they're big in the midwest (where oil is starting to boom again).
I think Q2 is going to be a knockout. Not sure when they report.
2160 2018-08-07 20:08:47 sir your thought right but "kisano ke tractor ke oil ko mahanga karna wrong hai sir''
2161 2018-08-07 20:08:43 @FoodNetwork Man vs Food. He said he’s been in the business for “Years of experience in the restaurant business”. I guess it wasn’t so great if he’s in commercials for cat litter and motor oil. He’s no Adam Richman. He’s just a cat shit scooping mechanic due to his commercials.
2162 2018-08-07 20:08:41 I never thought it made sense for one country to sell oil for another.   Tell the Canadiens to CRAM IT!

2165 2018-08-07 20:08:31 I understand this visceral dread, it’s something that has twisted my guts, too. Images of plastic-laden waves… just another sort of oil spill, really, and just as deadly. I’ve felt it seeing oil  on beloved waterways. I try to make conscious choices & wonder if it’s folly. /1
2166 2018-08-07 20:08:26 Nothing says "fighting climate change" like pushing through a pipeline with fake analysis. Your government is in the employment of the oil industry.
2167 2018-08-07 20:08:15 Iran iran iran yes the iranians are no saints but the wahhabi terrorists are extremists who deal with terrorists on daily basis. The world knows but keeps mum coz of u'r bloody oil. BLOODY MURDERERS ALL U KNOW IS KILLING YEMENIS.  SAUDI=TERROR
2168 2018-08-07 20:08:07 hey @JustinTrudeau. Time for some REAL change? Ban imports of Saudi oil
2169 2018-08-07 20:08:06 Weeeeeeell ... I am late but you may like frying diced sweet potatoes, onions, green beans, spinach & mushrooms in a wok of EV olive oil.  You could also dice carrots, soak them in honey and oil before roasting them, a chicken / turkey filled too.
2170 2018-08-07 20:07:54 Great comment. Google refining capabilities in Canada. You're on glue if you think having that pipeline would solve the problem. It will help us sell our oil but does not help us with gasoline, and other refined products. Irving just isn't that big.
2171 2018-08-07 20:07:50 Fantastic product wonderful ethics LOVE IT  wouldn’t use any other oil.... on my third jar just bout to order my 4th Thank you x
2172 2018-08-07 20:07:45 But nobody is “certain” how, or even if, Oil Well fires harmed our Gulf War Vets?
2173 2018-08-07 20:07:43 Sri's explanation is exactly why I think a lot of IR historians (with notable exceptions) are in the woods about this though. If you are a oil exporting country in the 1970s, you don't have an advantage. You have a problem.
2174 2018-08-07 20:07:42 Gowon said so. Show me. And yes Danjuma is lying. He didn't say jack till they didn't renew his oil bloc license.
2175 2018-08-07 20:07:04 No one @CNBC has mentioned why would Saudi Arabia funds wanna invest in Tesla a electric car maker if it will affect their Oil demand in the future?!
2176 2018-08-07 20:07:04 Plant sterols and stanols found in vegetable oils like olive oil, canola oil, peanut oil and coconut oil lower LDL cholesterol by blocking its absorption- 2gms (1/2 tsp) a day lowers seum LDL by 8-10%.

2179 2018-08-07 20:06:36 It would be even greater if the GOP didn't lie about climate change to prop up big oil and wealthy donors. How about doing everything possible to minimize the damage instead of lying about it. #DumpDean #HellerLies

2183 2018-08-07 20:06:18 Now why would one of the worlds largest oil producers not have cheap gas for their county. Answer is no refineries. They spent their money on nuclear technologies and funding terror activity.

2185 2018-08-07 20:06:05 Apologies for disappointing you! I'm going to attempt a political-related tweetstorm tomorrow, I hope, but yeah, it's a bit difficult now as we're just waiting for polls to close. But, hey, oil!

2191 2018-08-07 20:05:02 Who’s doing the shorting? People who want musk to fail. If you’ll allow me to don my tinfoil hat for a moment, I wouldn’t be at all surprised if its the other auto manufacturers and/or the oil industry (or their investors) who stand to lose by Tesla’s success.

2195 2018-08-07 20:04:35 FYI, there's an escalator clause in the agreements with the shippers; the oil companies that use the pipeline: Their tolls- the costs they pay to ship oil through the line -increase if production costs increase. Increased costs get passed on to the users, not the owner.

2200 2018-08-07 20:03:58 just think, If we had leadership  the east coast could “import” it’s oil from Alberta and Saskatchewan instead of Saudi Arabia.

2202 2018-08-07 20:03:37 Domestic oil production at all time high. So why are pump prices higher than they should be? Let alone imported oil coming in.
2203 2018-08-07 20:03:21 One thing Trump forgot to tell you?  Part of the big trade deficit we've got is from oil!  Add to that the fact that we're a big, consumer culture where much of the manufacturing got outsourced, especially on raw materials, and we happen to be a wealthy country that pays a lot...
2204 2018-08-07 20:03:08 Tea tree oil

2217 2018-08-07 20:02:04 Hahaha teach Seth how to change the oil. It’s super easy! Haha
2218 2018-08-07 20:02:01 New research is finding that canola oil is NOT a healthy option, especially when compared to olive oil. It causes weight gain and impacts memory. Until recently, it was prohibited from use in infant formula because it stunts growth.

2222 2018-08-07 20:01:23 1) Shut up! Your precious oil & gas industry uses 2-8 million gallons of water to frack one natural gas well. Some wells consume much more. 
Fracking wastewater can contain massive amounts of brine (salts), toxic metals, and radioactivity. And so the gas companies have a

One country does not tell another country how to act. That is called diplomacy.
If Trudeau wanted to fall on his sword on his self-righteous ideals, then Canada had better cut all ties with KSA esp oil.

Anyhow. Have just asperges the entire house in lavender oil which apparently they hate.
2239 2018-08-07 19:59:30 Just throwing this out there. If Canada were to stop importing Saudi oil is energy east back on the table? It would be quite comical to see Eastern Canada have a big push to get this going again.

2243 2018-08-07 19:58:45 Our #VeryStableGenius forgets the fact that Iran supplies 12% of world oil and OPEC (of which Iran is a member) supplies 40%.  The USA consumes 20% of world oil. Can we threaten the rest of the world to not buy from Iran? And how will we track the source of OPEC oil? #DotardDon
2244 2018-08-07 19:58:34 Not sure about your $25/barrel oil figure, but inflation means can’t compare the 2. Further, Klein left a massive infrastructure/social deficit that left successive govts buried. Agree re Redford failed Govt & NDP incompetence in managing budget & having realistic path to balance

2278 2018-08-07 19:55:22 You can keep arguing the same irrelevant point until you’re blue in the face. If we turn crude oil into margarine, that’s net positive; if we run cars on biofuels, that’s neutral.

All fossil fuels provide is a way to borrow carbon from the past. Balance the budget.

2295 2018-08-07 19:53:11 @CBDOilSolutions the oil is only helping with sleep right now.  With pain not so much.  What can i do??  I hurt so bad.   I cant take it anymore.
2296 2018-08-07 19:53:09 I’ve been making avocado toast with sprouted bread and i can’t get over how amazing it is. add a lil nutritional yeast, olive oil, red pepper flakes, cilantro, and minced onion. MMMM
2297 2018-08-07 19:53:02 thank you so much. i’m going to try the peppermint oil.
2298 2018-08-07 19:52:58 If only Canada had a safe , regulated  supply of oil eastern Canada wouldn’t have to import oil from Saudi Arabia .....oh wait #Alberta 

You screwed us on the energy east pipeline ......#karma
2299 2018-08-07 19:52:45 And thab had  another guy come up to me and say I shouldn’t be putting oil in my car (?) Bitch what. My car bought to explode. I didn’t to do it.
2300 2018-08-07 19:52:42 sad to see how well @RealAlexJones has manipulated conservatives and tech bros into defending his victim attacking snake oil operation on the grounds of free speech.
2301 2018-08-07 19:52:42 Use a clarifying shampoo, co wash your hair 2-3x weekly to get rid of dandruff. Oil your scalp when you’re wearing protective styles as well. Use light oils since your hair is fine.
2302 2018-08-07 19:52:24 he’s like that teaspoon of cod liver oil my mum used to make us have every morning. no fckn thanks mum. but she blocked all the exits so you had to take it.
2303 2018-08-07 19:52:17 I really just ate one whole kilo of kalamata olives I can’t wait until I throw up olive oil that’s how it works right
2304 2018-08-07 19:52:16 Just watch, the next thing will be jacking up crude oil output to bottom out the market price just as it's recovering.
2305 2018-08-07 19:52:04 rapaciously looks at my extra virgin olive oil
2306 2018-08-07 19:51:57 Is xom is converting from oil to natural gas just like Chesapeake
2307 2018-08-07 19:51:51 Saudi Arabia has one export, oil, they may have partial ownership of wheat board but our   farmers aren't obligated to sell to them it's just easier for them if we had a government with a backbone we could sell elsewhere they have to import 80% of there food.
2308 2018-08-07 19:51:33 By the way the Kuwait you are referring to owns its resources: oil, minerals, etc. Healthcare, education, media, etc. are significantly under the control of the state. These are all free
2309 2018-08-07 19:51:26 Now time for a hot oil treatment and deep conditioning and all that good stuff
2310 2018-08-07 19:51:22 So Trump harps on Germany for buying gas or oil from Russian but now we will be buying asbestos from Russian and adding more deaths to our people from a deadly substance. Is there any thing Trump won't do for Russia?
2311 2018-08-07 19:51:11 Does the east coast of Canada still buy their oil from the Saudi's?
2312 2018-08-07 19:51:10 David Dugas and Chad Collins representing South Louisiana’s, Bishop Lifting and Morgan City Rentals, at a Gulf of Mexico’s oil operator annual Offshore Personnel training seminar. #offshore #rentals
2313 2018-08-07 19:51:04 Yeah unless he is bluffing ... 
also, does that mean oil era is ending? That is the only valid reason for Saudis to make this offer.
2314 2018-08-07 19:51:00 Ageing yourself in a log of butter? I use almond oil but this is a good idea
2315 2018-08-07 19:50:54 jis trhan oil nikal raha ha Pakistan sy

lagta ha yeh b wesa he sona hoga jesa chiniot sy nikla tha
2316 2018-08-07 19:50:31 70 years ago is 3 generations and untold billions in oil revenues. It does not take that long to allow women the right to drive and to leave their homes without having to ask permission.
2317 2018-08-07 19:50:17 Literally $800 later and being told my car was good to go and not even making it home my engine light and oil light came on so here I am again for over an hour :-)))
2318 2018-08-07 19:50:11 Well, let's just say that german car manufacturers and international oil companies don't seem don't want to rush things here.
2319 2018-08-07 19:50:09 Attention Media where are the count down clocks for 45 California has been burning for how long now? When Obama was in office I remember the oil spill AND THE COINT DOWN DAYS OF THE SPILL. HE GOLFS WHILE YOU BURN 
2320 2018-08-07 19:49:59 Saudi Aramco was an underdog before we invaded Iraq and the rest of these countries, now they sell 12.5 million barrels of oil a day. So the establishment gets cheaper oil now, but look at our prices, from 95p to 1.33 a litre, that's the scam here n why they support them.
2321 2018-08-07 19:49:57 Palms 23:5 
You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies: you anoint my head with oil; my cup runs over.
2322 2018-08-07 19:49:56 No oil, no need to turn up after, just throw on (seasoned, of course) and cook! Spying through your replies, if you do veggies, I like to wrap them in a foil pack and throw them on, they steam and they're delicious. If you want more bite to them, get a grill pan/basket or skewers
2323 2018-08-07 19:49:55 Oh lord. I didn’t realize this oil blend had patchouli in it.
2324 2018-08-07 19:49:42 The problem is. No one knows how exactly strong Megatron is. I know his fusion cannon is connected to a black hole, so it has immense power. Megatron is the Polar Opposite if Optimus, and Optimus three an oil tanker at Megatron. No one really knows how strong transformers are.
2325 2018-08-07 19:49:38 Don’t forget economics and the low price of oil.
2326 2018-08-07 19:49:24 It's about driving Cadillacs in a future where industrial pollution led to extreme natural disasters and the collapse of civilization & also that same pollution caused dinosaurs to come back. My theory is that they freed the dinosaurs that had been turned into oil or something.
2327 2018-08-07 19:49:17 水(ウォーター)とは仲が悪いです。
2328 2018-08-07 19:49:16 u said Canada has more oil than us that’s sooooo funny
2329 2018-08-07 19:49:12 You are 1 of #Iran 's #80_million_nation :)

I am another one and this is what I would like to say to the meddling super powers who constantly shove their noses in middle east seeking oil and war induced benefits:
#StopMeddlingInIran and GTFO
2330 2018-08-07 19:49:03 You need Russian (Israeli) oil billionaire money. :)
2331 2018-08-07 19:48:59 Fue frustrado por la Guardia de Honor. Los terroristas hicieron todo lo que era suficiente para asesinar al Presidente.
2332 2018-08-07 19:48:55 We need refined oil, and we don’t refine enough here.  That’s the problem.
2333 2018-08-07 19:48:55 TREMENDOUS day one coverage of @FasigTiptonCo Saratoga by @JessMartiniTDN & @CDeBernardisTDN and special thanks to @BMassamTDN, @BDiDonatoTDN and @theTDN ad staff for burning the midnight oil.
2334 2018-08-07 19:48:52 Pretty sure tank factories and oil wells did more for them.
2335 2018-08-07 19:48:51 OIL OIL OIL . と紙に書くとサザエさんに聞こえる。
2336 2018-08-07 19:48:49 Oh you care about our forests now? Makes easier to drill for oil.
2337 2018-08-07 19:48:45 Scalding water was more likely.  Oil was scarce.
2338 2018-08-07 19:48:44 At a Congressional hearing, she ran her mouth about #AmericansAbroad and #AccidentalAmericans being suspected criminals, money launderers, human traffickers & drug dealers. She tried to peddle SCE snake oil. She didn’t know what #FATCA was & kept calling it FACTA. #EPICFAIL x 3
2339 2018-08-07 19:48:42 Safe journey home
2340 2018-08-07 19:48:33 My fave is LUSH's No Drought. Has kind of a lemon-y smell to it, and it soaks up oil without leaving too much build-up/residue since it's a powder and not an aerosol.
2341 2018-08-07 19:48:30 Great morning... Hope funding is not from Big oil!
2342 2018-08-07 19:48:29 Good thought the price of oil this morning was 68 $ a barrel if it goes higher everything will become more expensive.  The higher oil price will heat up inflation.
2343 2018-08-07 19:48:10 Capitalism works when there is fair competition. Vertically integrated firms such as Facebook, Google, etc., should have to separate the ad sales from their content services. This has precedent in antitrust realm, AT&T and back to Standard Oil. Next Congress! Bills being drafted.
2344 2018-08-07 19:48:07 Sardines in oil out of a flat tin with no utensils...
2345 2018-08-07 19:48:07 If you get burnt by drops of oil, rub salt on it to prevent it from forming a bubble. Or real rub honey on the burn. It eases the pain and helps prevent scarring. #RandomHacks
2346 2018-08-07 19:48:05 Night 2 & coat 2 (of 4!) of linseed oil for some bedroom furniture. I’ve gone from ‘save the earth’ to ‘chemicals would have given me more time to drink wine’. 25 year-old Greenpeace super fan me is disgusted with middle-aged, throw-a-feckin-can-of-paint-at-it me #ashamed
2347 2018-08-07 19:48:02 The oil cleanser I just bought basically is @riekeoka's fault 
2348 2018-08-07 19:48:00 Yeah but you get a ‘bigger’ oil dividend every day, don’t you?
No PST.
2349 2018-08-07 19:47:56 We have money more than u we have oil more than u , our country is very rich and our people are very rich and our country are help us so much. We have no unemployment else our ppl are going well on the life ، our people are the only people who enjoy their lives in a special way
2350 2018-08-07 19:47:51 I’m really pushing the limit on how long my car can go before I get an oil change
2351 2018-08-07 19:47:50 Yes with Canadian oil
2352 2018-08-07 19:47:49 The modern nation Of Saudi Arabia was formed by the West, US & UK over oil early 1900s after oil seeps were noted. Can't negotiate oil agreements with ALL Bedouin tribes. West armed and backed Saud. Oil was discovered about the same time Saud became Official
2353 2018-08-07 19:47:45 Burnt myself twice today with hot oil and my boyfriend had to do first aid and an accident report form 
2354 2018-08-07 19:47:45 Excellent. You reminded me about it. What stuck in my mind? Changing the oil in the desert and letting it drain into the sand.
2355 2018-08-07 19:47:42 can they go private if prices go above 420$ ? $tsla

2361 2018-08-07 19:46:57 Stop all oil sands immediately if you are serious about the environment
2362 2018-08-07 19:46:57 Never been there. Not doubting u. I think NPS/Interior has same problem. Now fees. But at least u don’t have oil rigs, roll back of endangered species, etc. Pretty soon our national parks will look like drained swamps.
2363 2018-08-07 19:46:45 OIL: O PÓ NO MONOPÓLIO!
#palindromo
2364 2018-08-07 19:46:38 No shit! Build the pipeline to the east ffs! Total hypocrisy to have Saudi tankers sailing into Montreal 24/7 and not buy Canadian oil! Especially when Quebec has  been pocketing billions in Alberta transfer payments!
2365 2018-08-07 19:46:38 Here is to hope that we find new sources of stable alternative energy. Cuz when oil will get left behind so will they and the world will be a more peaceful place.
2366 2018-08-07 19:46:30 Companies drilling for oil in the Gulf were driven to ever deeper waters by environmentalist. When the problem occurred on Deepwater Horizon, the well head was so deep, it was difficult to repair.

If this had been a normal depth well, there would not have been a problem.
2367 2018-08-07 19:46:23 Hmmm explain what melted the last ICE AGE that scientists say happened 18,000 years ago-were no cars, factories, Hollywood concerts, Disneyland using all that oil and coal. Maybe CA should catch their overflow from dams that go into the Pacific Ocean and plant billions of trees
2368 2018-08-07 19:46:22 Wish me luck that i get hired for H&P so i can head out to the oil rigs , they just contacted me 
2369 2018-08-07 19:46:17 Yeah, I see what you mean, especially with the resurgence of a new Wild West with the oil boom and all that it brought. The history gives me hope, though, that some of these older social preferences can break through again.
2370 2018-08-07 19:46:13 what a opening $TSLA now 10% up
2371 2018-08-07 19:46:10 I remember nkiwa 8, I always wanted coca cola soda which was rare, so i took kibuyu ya oil imejaa nkamwaga kwa shimo ya maji ndio tuchote maji ya black kama soda..vita ya come and see

2372 2018-08-07 19:46:00 James looked at the menu. He noticed something odd. The menu here was exactly the same as the menu at the New York Sandwich Shoppe. There were even motor oil and lug nut sandwiches, an item which he'd only suggested as a joke but which sold surprisingly well.
2373 2018-08-07 19:45:52 Lmfaooo. Olive oil: the answer to all things in life
2374 2018-08-07 19:45:37 beeswax and coconut oil

#COMEDIAN EZEMUO BLUETOOTH
2378 2018-08-07 19:45:08 Use natural oils like argon, coconut, peppermint (I’ll send you some more later) and do hot oil treatments. Cover your hair from scalp to end and then put a cap on a let it sit for like an hour. The best.
2379 2018-08-07 19:45:00 Ya’ll I am here to tell you if you have not tried CBD oil and you have PTSD, please give it a try. Talk to your doc about it first of course, but I haven’t had a meltdown or panic attack since I started using it last Thursday. Also, it is legal and non-psychotropic. No THC. 
2380 2018-08-07 19:44:46 Intelligence: putting vape oil on top of a hot server for a multi-million dollar company...what could POSSIBLY go wrong?
2381 2018-08-07 19:44:39 You provoking a war . Iran will say well if we cannot export our oil then no one can . The strait of Hormuz is off the Iranian coast line your war ships seem to be lost. Most of the worlds energy comes through the strait . You are doing the opposite of peace and provoking war
2382 2018-08-07 19:44:28 Why the hell are we importing #oil from Saudi in the first place? #cdnpoli #yyc #ableg
2383 2018-08-07 19:44:27 Still trying to sell that snake oil! Socialism does NOT WORK! Socialism kills innovation and enslaves the masses! #WalkAway
2384 2018-08-07 19:44:20 my mental picture of Soviet industry is a big coal and steel sector feeding smaller arms and consumer goods sectors into the late '50s, and then a shrinking coal and steel sector feeding bigger consumer and arms sectors (funded by oil exports) afterwards. no?

2386 2018-08-07 19:43:49 Been trading internal @WoodMackenzie emails today on tight oil EOR. Just my two cents, but I think $OXY and $DNR should form a JV to figure this one out. Would be an all-star team.
2387 2018-08-07 19:43:44 And what if they want more? This could be a pure-play hedge against oil being phased out. Plus a few more warm years like this and general public will be rallying against any legacy energy in such a way that any oil spillage protest of the past will look like a quiet gathering.
2388 2018-08-07 19:43:39 #ksa has been the cause of many violences muslims and only hold power because they got oil and contain the holy cities of Mecca n Medina. Neither they nor Iran should be considered as the true voices of islam as islam condemns violence n hatred that they spew. #isupportcanada
2389 2018-08-07 19:43:27 the coconut oil?
2390 2018-08-07 19:43:25 I cannot stop coming like icing. It comes out in clumps and hurts really bad. it smells like crude oil and canine breath, i don't know what to do. The girls i cum in are prosititutes so i wont have to hear from them when the stench does not leave.
2391 2018-08-07 19:43:19 omg i never knew that! i cleanse w/ african black soap (i know, i know...i need to find something else) i use a hylauronic + vitamin c serum; then the tea tree oil, aloe vera gel, nip & fab kale moisturizer and then marula oil!
2392 2018-08-07 19:43:16 “Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund has acquired a $2 billion stake in the company.” Yeah, there goes big oil conspiring against him again.
2393 2018-08-07 19:43:08 Son falsos positivos, bien preparados!!
2394 2018-08-07 19:42:49 screw you, sauidi arabica. fry in your own oil.
2395 2018-08-07 19:42:40 Everything I buy now I compare to the price for a sub from sheetz.. oh, this shirts 12 dollars.. that’s 4 subs from sheetz.. I could get my oil changed for 27 dollars.. orrrr, I could get 9 subs from sheetz..
2396 2018-08-07 19:42:36 hello !! In a period id 2 1/2 yrs since the tweet, the int'l oil prices hv nearly doubled, so this request mks no sense at all
2397 2018-08-07 19:42:36 Canada has plenty of its own oil. Why would we import it?
2398 2018-08-07 19:42:26 PDP has secretly met with oil marketers. They are planning to cause artificial fuel scarcity in November till 2019 elections.
2399 2018-08-07 19:42:10 Quite right there is nothing charming about Saudi's dictatorship and its medieval laws. The west panders to this evil because of oil greed and arms sales. Show your true sense of human rights @theresa_may and expel Saudi Ambassador today!
2400 2018-08-07 19:42:06 Hang on just one doggone minute...which side is Big Oil on?

#Tesla
2401 2018-08-07 19:42:00 But they're NOT minus oil, which is the point. Even if their own army isn't up to the job, they could easily hire mercenaries. Modern urban Canadians have very little stomach for suffering and it wouldn't take much of a show of force to cow them.
2402 2018-08-07 19:42:00 Completamente! demuestra el carácter aplomado, de mi Presidente!! Firme como la roca.
2403 2018-08-07 19:41:46 GOP is the only governing body in the entire world that denies climate change. Every country on Earth signed on to Paris Accord. US only country to withdraw.
Out of 7.5 billion people, you really believe just a few million Republicans (owned by Big Oil) are right? 
2404 2018-08-07 19:41:34 Warren Buffet invest a half a Billion dollars in that tar sands. Also invested millions into Obama’s campaign. Buffett was moving the oil in his trains through America to Texas. A pipeline would have killed his investment. Obama couldn’t allow that after he paid for his campaign
2405 2018-08-07 19:41:33 Iranian president Rouhani also said the country can rely on China and Russia to supplement its oil and banking sectors amid the U.S. imposed sanctions. NOW, US and ALLIES must PUNISH RUSSIA and CHINA for their WRONG SIDING with IRAN!
2406 2018-08-07 19:41:30 I've never seen this before, you have opened a whole new world for me, thank you (has been looking up the butter europe vs olive oil europe, etc for the last 10 minutes and is in awe)
2407 2018-08-07 19:41:13 Coat chicken breasts (or whatever kind of chicken you want) in olive oil, then season thoroughly in a dry rub of: brown sugar, paprika, salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, dry mustard, cumin, and chili powder/cayenne (your heat choice) pt1
2408 2018-08-07 19:41:03 Link is oil, not oil!
2409 2018-08-07 19:40:59 also recently incorporated marula oil to help w/ my oily skin. could that be the cause?
2410 2018-08-07 19:40:47 今月はTwitter控えます、多分
2411 2018-08-07 19:40:47 You must've been toking up when he spoke at length about antitrust action.  The govt took apart Standard Oil for dominating oil production.  Should they not take out monopolies that control speech & information?
2412 2018-08-07 19:40:46 Lorenzo’s Oil
2413 2018-08-07 19:40:45 Ahaaaaa I’ve never used oil painting, looks so cool!!
2414 2018-08-07 19:40:43 Agree but we have to be honest -no way western Canada oil gets to the east, hell I bet Transmountian never gets built - if anything US oil replaces Saudi oil in the east - Canada is broken and a joke when it comes to properly using our resources

2418 2018-08-07 19:40:26 My mum does that too  i try to cook healthy but she's like you need to put more oil
2419 2018-08-07 19:40:23 Network effects cause a steep barrier to entry for competition.

This is why Standard Oil was broken up and the utility company can't shut off your power for dissident political beliefs.

“This isn’t working out”

2426 2018-08-07 19:39:56 Yay writing furry porn as I wait for an oil change.
Been here for nearly 2 hours already. Getying home is gonna be a pain with the rush hour traffic that started 40 minutes ago.
*sigh*
2427 2018-08-07 19:39:50 I can NEVER get my coconut oil open I’m crying why am I so weak
2428 2018-08-07 19:39:48 I actually think there is a paper to be written (maybe I'll do it one day once I get more and more comfortable with some of the modeling involved) that the boost to the Russian economy from 1998 to 2014 wasn't just oil but just how massively repressed consumers were since 47.
2429 2018-08-07 19:39:47 They know oil has no future that’s why hehe!
2430 2018-08-07 19:39:41 Always remember the @infowars motto.......

"We're putting the fun back in racism, hypocrisy and snake oil supplements"
2431 2018-08-07 19:39:31 @ICEespanol @ICEgovTampa @NASA_ICE Asian man in my Attic he from Miami FL but he is in my Attic here Newport News VA 23606 He has a Tactic Flash light with built in knife.He giving my daughter by needle Cannes oil. Black Police involvex
2432 2018-08-07 19:39:12 We all on this planet, the only with life, must stop oil drilling and gas fracking. Nature gives us all what we need! Less consumpton - more life. We are one planet.
2433 2018-08-07 19:39:00 Hi Mike, I would like to get a link to the footage to post on my Boycott Big Oil FB page. Can you please send me that.
thanks so much,

2434 2018-08-07 19:38:55 Most fbs are failed CBs or failed wingers .... he was clearly never a CB so he must tried to be a winger.... he failed....! I like him used sparingly .... he’s not a first choice but for a club not owned by an oil baron we’re gonna have to accept a lesser player as back up
2435 2018-08-07 19:38:48 What would the motivation be? To grab the oil? Are people ready to die for that?
2436 2018-08-07 19:38:39 Listen. These are the reasons I’m staying it’s this #Camry for the forseeable future. I’m not paying for premium gas or expensive ass oil changes 
2437 2018-08-07 19:38:34 Lol I think it's to prevent getting burnt but I'm just wondering if it won't melt when the oil touches it 
2438 2018-08-07 19:38:32 do u think i could just pour vs pink warm & cozy body spray into my essential oil diffuser orrrr
2439 2018-08-07 19:38:12 It's to be drinking black seed oil, camel urine and zaytun.. 
Oh and zam zam plus dabinu
2440 2018-08-07 19:38:03 Wrong. The gap between our oil and WTI was never this large under Harper. The left wing parties have strangled our oil sands with pipe capacity. There was no reason energy east shouldn't have gone in. 100% trudeau's fault
2441 2018-08-07 19:37:52 I really want to attempt to change my oil myself but I just imagine something going all wrong lol

2443 2018-08-07 19:37:35 Loads of idiot round here. If you think this sport has something to do with bisexual or homosexual relationships, go get hooked with one of the oil wrestlers and see the outcome
2444 2018-08-07 19:37:33 pake bio oil
2445 2018-08-07 19:37:20 The whole free world should rise and tell these guys that their oil money means nothing  #yodontfuckwithcanada
2446 2018-08-07 19:37:17 Please do not sell to oil linked company
2447 2018-08-07 19:37:06 There's good oil and bad oil. Like, your skin needs oil and a lot of the time people get zits because their skin is overcompensating because it's NOT getting the good oils. I actually started oil cleansing as a teen, because Sophia Loren.
2448 2018-08-07 19:37:04 so cool to be part of this team ! i'm happy for you oil king :)
2449 2018-08-07 19:36:53 Are they putting you through a series of adjustments to correct what's causing it or is the oil the only thing they recommended
2450 2018-08-07 19:36:52 If you want a conversation from me dont give me simple fucking answers.
I am water, I dont need oil floating around contaminating my shit.
You either get the flow or you dont.
Im too pure for simple shit. 
You either want a full blown conversation or Ima skim yo ass.
2451 2018-08-07 19:36:44 I had 3 passports inspecting rigs to make they behaving themselves ie the right equipment to reprosess the chemicals  used drilling oil wells. 36 years
2452 2018-08-07 19:36:44 The @nytfood robot dreams of one day becoming an olive oil cake
2453 2018-08-07 19:36:31 Yeah, but Youtube & the rest are a lot more like public utilities than Alex Jones is. As @JZmirak points out, we wldn't have put up with Ma Bell cutting us off from phone service for saying ugly things. Never liked trust-busting, but FB seems harder to replace than Standard Oil.
2454 2018-08-07 19:36:30 Not that there’s great American cheese but that super low end stuff made out of vegetable oil is pretty freaky.
2455 2018-08-07 19:36:29 Oil is already running out in lighter
My stomach is nervously burning inside

Meltdown, iroha
2456 2018-08-07 19:36:28 Awesome news. Cbd oil and other cbd products are so much better. They help with so many thing's and make peoples lives easier to live.
2457 2018-08-07 19:36:27 @IN_n_OUTcentres I usually go to the cardiff branch for my service and mot. My car has an oil leak is this something they can help fix for me?
2458 2018-08-07 19:36:20 Cos it's called Hypocrisy think of how much environmental pollution formula one has created from the creation of tires to the oil etc that fuels them he's a total hypocrite
2459 2018-08-07 19:36:16 Sadly there’s nothing you can do it’s a public street. We have the exact same problem in our neighborhood. Someone’s car leaks oil so they park in front of my house not in their driveway. You can call the city It just has to be moved every like 48 hours.
2460 2018-08-07 19:36:13 its actually really good for your hair. the natural oil, sebum, has time to settle. brushing your hair everyday in the process will make it so much stronger/healthier and A LOT softer. nothing wrong with it! it’s actually probably one of the best things you can do for your hair
2461 2018-08-07 19:36:12 @chrisdelia on the real though, you are an amazing guy. Just use less olive oil on your lips and you’ll be good bro.
2462 2018-08-07 19:36:05 Yeah, too bad they killed the pipeline that would have sent oil there from Alberta.
2463 2018-08-07 19:36:03 —Dry Hair
1 ripped Banana
1 tbsp. of Honey
1 tbsp. of Olive or Almond Oil
2-3 drops of Lavender Oil

Until it’s a smooth liquid with no banana lumps, blend it.
Add the mask, massaging your scalp and cover your hair with a shower cap along with a warm towel.
Sit for 15 min.

2472 2018-08-07 19:35:15 Salty Cooking-tip number 1. 
Salt dissolves in water but not oil. Preparing meat or vegetables? If you apply the oil before the salt, the salt stays on the surface, and remains grainy. But if you apply salt before the oil, you’ll get better penetration of salt into the food.

2477 2018-08-07 19:34:54 I’ve literally been waiting 2 hours for just an oil change and a patch on my tire. Wtf. And y’all still ain’t done? What’s the point in an appointment?
2478 2018-08-07 19:34:41 Oil money...
2479 2018-08-07 19:34:24 Motor oil
2480 2018-08-07 19:34:20 Today, in his press statement Abdullah Haroon said he only talked about offshore exploration of ExxonMobil, he is apparently denying this story of big oil discovery near Iran. Wonder why this @Dawn_News reporter put his boss in an awkward situation?
2481 2018-08-07 19:34:02 DJT was never going to drain the swamp.  He’s just a snake oil salesman who duped 62,980,160 voters.   65,845,063 Americans knew that was just bullshit.  

Pence is a hypocrite Christian who says what suits his purpose at the time.  He is smarter than Trump so more dangerous.
2482 2018-08-07 19:33:46 That one time my friends made breakfast but didn’t tell me they cooked with thc oil and seasoned everything with Mary Jane and I fucked around and went to sleep at 10am for 12 hours 
2483 2018-08-07 19:33:16 But my point, moreso, wasn't about communities being targets in battling climate change, but that economies may collapse or significantly reduce in the process of trying to put the brakes on. Imagine if we truly halted oil production and fossil fuel usage.

Lo único que me preocupa es que no veo que en las ciudades haya planes para sustituir las calderas de gas oil por alternativas mejores.

2490 2018-08-07 19:32:40 —Damaged Hair
1 ripped Avocado
1-2 tsp. of Olive Oil

Mash up ingredients, and separate dry hair into 4 sections. (2 up, 2 down)
To apply the mask into each section, use a pastry brush.
After, cover with a shower cap & leave it on for 30 minutes.
Rinse in shower using shampoo.
2491 2018-08-07 19:32:20 Screw off BOT! We have our own oil, as well as our principles.
2492 2018-08-07 19:32:15 Benidorn and any gas/oil project in the world. Lot share tickets with lads on the opposite shift. SWFC are a great club, Please don't turn into bitter seat counters like the mackems
2493 2018-08-07 19:32:00 I had a gorgeous-skinned elderly babysitter when I was a kid and she used the Oil of Olay, original stuff, smelled like...Oil of Olay, unique.
2494 2018-08-07 19:31:48 Ah, here comes the rain. I love the smell of patchouli oil. I mean patrfkoricior. Schnurkems essence. Pavement stink. Whatevs.
2495 2018-08-07 19:31:47 I think maximum pressure campaign on Iran  continues till regime get rid of false mistake if sancations are reinforce it also harmed US also Iran block supply of oil to world there are many options especially blockage of hamtoz
2496 2018-08-07 19:31:45 just learned that lavender tea tree oil is bad for cats... disappointed yet still fully prepared to stop using it
2497 2018-08-07 19:31:22 Where is this ignorance coming from. They have what vast wealth? Fortunately economic indexes are publicly available for all read. Minus oil Saudi Arabia is a third world developing country. The monarchs are rich but the people are not.
2498 2018-08-07 19:31:17 Stop trying to Science. You are out of your depth. Next you’ll be telling us if we just filled CA lands with oil rigs, we’d be able to draw of all the fuel that feeds the fires.
2499 2018-08-07 19:31:14 Middle school was like that but then getting drowned by the motor oil that came out of the truck

2502 2018-08-07 19:31:00 The government of Kazakhstan has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Florence Welch in a buckram wig.
2503 2018-08-07 19:30:54 Can’t believe I haven’t tasted oil based stew in over a month.. like meat stew or turkey stew, worst still I’ve only eaten a small portion of rice once since June..
2504 2018-08-07 19:30:50 Batana oil smells really good
2505 2018-08-07 19:30:49 Yoo Don! You’ve always driven a hard bargain.... I was hoping to get my last min shopping in for some gold blocks and some of that good old crude oil. No worries, I’ll try Iraq.. “Viva La Trump” 
2506 2018-08-07 19:30:46 Of fucking course....I’ll drive them around for free & buy them oil pens!
2507 2018-08-07 19:30:43 They’re covering their oil interests against a massive downside in the future

Shame that all the history books will have gone up in flames too -  great legacy that no one will be able to celebrate #idiot
2511 2018-08-07 19:30:26 Oil is the lifeblood of modern society. No contemporary civilization can function without it, and replacements are decades away. People buy from Arabia because it's less galling than buying from Russia.

They're not going to jeopardize that just for the sake of virtue-signalling.
2512 2018-08-07 19:30:22 Yes but that is bad, stinky, sweaty oil. You need the sweet olive oil of magical goodness!
2513 2018-08-07 19:30:21 Very true, learned that one the hard way. Honestly I only managed to about break even on my day trading. Found crypto investing more to my liking, but have never had the same rush as trading on oil inventories.
2514 2018-08-07 19:30:18 I need a oil change who gonna take me

2523 2018-08-07 19:29:30 After the first few oil washes I was like OMG I wish I could go back and tell my teen self about this. XD
2524 2018-08-07 19:29:28 And he himself noted back then the heat trapping effects of CO2, and the effects that releasing millions of tons of CO2 into the atmosphere would have on the climate. The fact that you think some stupid fucking right wing, oil lobby funded think tank knows more about climate
2525 2018-08-07 19:29:19 I'm with you. Much as the naysayers want to deny it, as a modern society, we NEED oil. Better it's our own (& aren't we lucky to have it) than be hostage to foreign entities. Better too to transport by pipelines rather than rail as history has shown.
2526 2018-08-07 19:29:15 "Washington’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and target the country's oil sector with sanctions is expected to significantly boost China's leverage to demand crude imports be priced in yuan."
Trump has given this petro-yuan futures market a boost.
2527 2018-08-07 19:29:11 @elonmusk So the new format of 'quarter' results press conference will be packed with exciting questions and disruptive idea sharing in technology without a worry about oil investors turning each statement upside down? Hell f yeah dude 
2528 2018-08-07 19:29:11 DID YOU KNOW? Once up and running, the new refinery & petrochemical plant being built in Lagos by Africa’s richest billionaire, Aliko Dangote, will process 650,000 barrels of oil per day, that is 1/3 of Nigeria’s daily production, and 1% of global production.
2529 2018-08-07 19:28:56 I stopped in and got an oil change on Saturday with the dog, you weren’t there lol
2530 2018-08-07 19:28:51 I tried it and it was amazing, you can feel the oil soaking out the bad things from the pores!
2531 2018-08-07 19:28:50 I would love to see these changes, but all the rednecks I'm surrounded by who only love buying gas guzzling vehicles & spewing oil all over the forest while denying #ClimateChange makes me think it's impossible

2535 2018-08-07 19:27:36 going to my first oil acrylic and gouache painting class so suck it haters
2536 2018-08-07 19:27:27 I’m not trying to start an argument, but this simply isn’t correct and doesn’t make sense. So we should just keep all the oil we produce inside Oklahoma and never sell it?
2537 2018-08-07 19:27:27 It’s crazy how so many people swear by tea tree oil for their acne issues but I’m so allergic to it and always have a bad reaction
2538 2018-08-07 19:27:23 Conservatives: "Muslims are terrorists and we need to stop buying oil from Saudi Arabia!"

Also Conservatives: "WTF Justin? Why did you damage our relationship with Saudi Arabia and force them to put sanctions on us?"

2544 2018-08-07 19:27:07 Last time Canada gave foreign aid to Saudi Arabai 2001, but Canada still buys Saudi Oil. #LOL
2545 2018-08-07 19:26:45 Someone mentioned Saudi money.
Sometimes it's fun to be a little conspiracy nutty; Saudi oil money removes Tesla from market, confirmed!
2546 2018-08-07 19:26:31 Just quit mate, after 2 depressing years of brexit means brexit and all the other crap the snake oil salesmen spout it's clear no deal brexit is unplanned chaos and missery for everyone including the fishing industry.
For fuck sake start listening to experts again, please!
2547 2018-08-07 19:26:10 I smell like coconut oil, shea butter and the desperate effort of translucent-pale individual to self-tan.

2548 2018-08-07 19:26:10 Dear .@cafreeland and PM @JustinTrudeau ,
Now that KSA is pissed off with us and canceling trade and removing their students from our Universities how about:
1. Cancelling the ARMs sale contract with KSA?
2. Banning oil imports from KSA?
2549 2018-08-07 19:26:06 3) ......This took advantage of being in the EU and our geographical position, midway between the USA and Asia. Now we have to try to restructure again with no North Sea Oil money and most probably tariffs from our largest market. A deep self inflicted wound.
2550 2018-08-07 19:25:52 What a nifty person!  I’ve been a Beto fan for a long long time. Love the car trips.  He did one from Houston to Washington with Will Hurd, a Republican Congressman, and recorded the conversations. And Cruz is such a snake oil salesman. GO, BETO
2551 2018-08-07 19:25:51 That’s quite ironic how you’re talking about money considering your “government” sells out their citizens and keep all the oil money to themselves while you guys live in huts 
2552 2018-08-07 19:25:47 WOAH, no. The ph in Borax is way, way too high for a human face. Could cause some serious irritation. Oddly enough, a lot of people with acne have had luck with oil cleansing, might be worth checking out?
2553 2018-08-07 19:25:47 Tesla is fulfilling it’s destiny to be bought out by big oil and to self-destruct itself into a private company with no checks and balances in the marketplace. Many of us knew it had to end someway somehow at some time.
2554 2018-08-07 19:25:36 Gospel drill is sacrilegious. Oil and water. That’s that on that.
2555 2018-08-07 19:25:30 Miss Robertson does not import crude oil, ever & she was blamed. And, that guy went to prison.

2558 2018-08-07 19:25:11 One slight correction if I may,

Just like Rockefeller, Standard Oil and JP Morgan, all-time combined wealth and influence.
2559 2018-08-07 19:25:07 Anything like that or even close is cheating.
Its one thing that leads to another. 
You don't go putting oil on fire when you want to drink tea.
2560 2018-08-07 19:25:07 It will take a bit of time since Obama administration ensured Iran's progress toward nuclear weapons. The harsh sanctions will just do that, when the oil money runs out they will not have money to spend on nuclear weapons. Appeasements certainly didn't work.
2561 2018-08-07 19:25:05 We don't have oil money. That's a fact
2562 2018-08-07 19:25:00 No, it was a big tent to sell snake oil to gullible, angry, frightened people.

2568 2018-08-07 19:23:59 The strike and the oil part. Obama put lots of sanctions on Russia and is why Putin didn't like him.

2570 2018-08-07 19:23:52 @FoxNews i’m a Christian I follow some of the prophet and one of them said that       Iran,China ,Russia and some other countries have decided to buy oil with gold instead of the US dollar could you please look into this

2584 2018-08-07 19:22:44 I tried using vegan butter. It tasted good but got too dry to make lattice out of. I used to make a pretty good olive oil crust that was vegan. I’m going to try coconut oil crust next time.

2592 2018-08-07 19:22:21 Too bad we did not have #EnergyEast Canada could use all Canadian oil Domestically .
Forget these countries that have limited human rights.

2593 2018-08-07 19:22:18 If only there was somewhere we could refine crude oil in Canada.  From Canadian sources.  Like Alberta.  And we could not build another pipeline to ship the oil somewhere else.
2594 2018-08-07 19:22:14 I don't see why you would believe this. Renewables are used almost solely for electricity generation, where oil has long been uncompetitive when measured against coal and gas. Oil can command a high price because, in addition to electricity, there is also a demand for liquid fuel
2595 2018-08-07 19:22:07 They should start renegotiating oil prices with both countries E. g “yo MBS? Trudeau said your mama smells of camel dung and that he would sell oil for $62/ barrel...” “yo Trudeau? MBS said he wishes your mama to be raped by a thousand camels, will sell oil for $59/ barrel...”

2598 2018-08-07 19:21:47 I agree. Both CBD oil and the gummies have helped me So much with my anxiety. I wish I would have started on this a long time ago.
2599 2018-08-07 19:21:41 But please tell us @realDonaldTrump how we don't need emission laws or greener power, and about how good coal an oil are for us.

2639 2018-08-07 19:18:12 A purpose of the Euro was to compete with Petro Dollar. Europe had to buy US$ to pay for oil. It's like a sales tax. And when US devalues the US$ by debt or war Europe pays more for oil. Europe cut deal with Russia to accept Euros for oil. That's one angle of the Euro creation.

2648 2018-08-07 19:17:21 Saudi Arabia gets ticked off by other nations all the time. We just don’t hear about it. Further, if other nations can intervene to secure oil or effect regime change, why can they not do the same for a less self-serving agenda?

2663 2018-08-07 19:16:08 Oil from stimulated reservoirs is either high or low carbon (on LCA basis) depending on the emissions created by extraction/refining. If reservoir is stimulated via CCS, then low GHG, if by steam from turbines, high GHG. If CCS used for H2 at the refinery, that will lower GHGs.
2664 2018-08-07 19:16:00 Pruitt is allergic to science. Pretty sure everyone knows that. If it impeded his ability to take money from Big Oil or his other allies, it was immediately discounted, ignored, and altered to suit his agenda.

2681 2018-08-07 19:14:04 Oh nice. Do you use the paper filters? Or a screen? I have some stainless screen ones here I bought to filter cooking oil through that were meant for the Aeropress but haven't tried them yet.
2682 2018-08-07 19:13:58 it also means i’ve had to crack out the orange blossom oil that my mum got me which seems to be helping
2683 2018-08-07 19:13:57 An on time oil change is the key to Grit. Can’t have sludge building up in your HEART
2684 2018-08-07 19:13:54 @GraveB4Shave will you guys ever have a oil/wax the same scent as your bead wash? #ibegyou, until then I’ll enjoy bay rum

2686 2018-08-07 19:13:27 12% of our crude oil comes from Saudi Arabia. That's gone because she couldn't keep her twitter account in check. Add carbon taxes and 15k students (paying full tuition) being pulled from our universities, she has delivered an economic blow to hard working Canadians!
2687 2018-08-07 19:13:26 Walking around the riv with a bunch of coconut  oil in my hair cause it’s hot af and I’m deep conditioning out here lmaooOoo
2688 2018-08-07 19:13:22 Workout, Target, oil change, tire rotation and blood donation by 12?! 

Killing the game on a Tuesday!
2689 2018-08-07 19:13:05 Pipeline East>  Maybe now tree huggers will see too late the benefits of Pipeline East to offset unnecessary importation of Saudi oil.  Dont worry, the Saudis will cut off Canada from any more Saudi oil. All of our oil companies are owned by the USA.  $2.00/litre gasoline soon!
2690 2018-08-07 19:12:55 It's a quite abnormal and un-natural for Britain to come far to Africa and created a monster and hand it over to Islam. 
#Biafrans are Christians. Handing over the #Biafrans to the #Hausa/Fulani is like mixing up oil and water. Crime of Britain against #Biafrans! @crimesofbrits
2691 2018-08-07 19:12:42 #ukog The oil-related sanctions will take effect in November, and analysts expect countries to begin cutting their imports from Iran with that deadline now only 3 months away. Estimates on outages vary, but many analysts expect the losses to top 1  oil could hit $90
2692 2018-08-07 19:12:40 For anyone who says smoking weed helps asthma you are an idiot. However I do believe that the anti-inflammatatory properties of CBD oil do actually help. The key word there was “smoking” smoking is bad for your lungs no matter what it is.
2693 2018-08-07 19:12:37 Oil and gas plays where notable reserve increases eg 1500% increase to P1 alone can blow conentional TA out. I am very bullish here on fundi's alone but all come with risk. Appreciated your TA with Enquest, no longer hold there but CO. Looking in better shape now. Best regards.
2694 2018-08-07 19:12:28 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2695 2018-08-07 19:12:13 15% of Canada's oil imports come from SA.
2696 2018-08-07 19:12:09 The president himself 1.4trillion subsidy under G payment, with passing the through channel which is the sanate.. No wonder he's the petroleum minister..

2.8billion naira, oil money isn't missing (in fela's voice)
2697 2018-08-07 19:12:05 Ifu missed a line in her posts on IG. She should have included 'My 2 yrs old hair was styled using beautifuenada leave-in conditioner n super hair oil' since everything is a means to an end for her. Let us just know that she wrote the post to promote her hair products #BBNaija
2698 2018-08-07 19:12:01 Oil = $$$$.
2699 2018-08-07 19:11:55 West Hollywood needs to vet who gets a star. DJT has never been more than a snake oil salesman & a grifter. Hollywood has had so many talented legendary folks that rate to be on the Walk of Fame, they don’t need fake !
2700 2018-08-07 19:11:55 Dude, Alex jones made a death threat towards the special counselor. That alone is a felony and well beyond his first ammendment rights on free speech. This isn't a right/ left issue. He was pressing his luck as hard as he does his snake oil.
2701 2018-08-07 19:11:51 I live in Austin TX, where Rick Perry was governor for an excruciatingly long time. He’s in bed with the oil and gas industry. Maybe Mattis?
2702 2018-08-07 19:11:19 Came to get an oil change and there is 4 other Escapes here, everyone is like WTF going on 
2703 2018-08-07 19:11:11 Ok so I’m the 1st and about to be the second largest oil exporter in the world; my bigger risk is liquified Nat gas plus the Us has and is worlds largest economy  is only short pipelines to destroy my primary income source. Of course you a elec bar company as a hedge
2704 2018-08-07 19:10:43 I make nd sell  organic oil for skin nd hair care very affordable.pls RT nd patronise thanks.
2705 2018-08-07 19:10:42 Non-sensical, no strategy, no planning, no studying. Remember, he said no studying. He was just going to feel his way through it. He knew best. He'd be able to tell in the first 15 minutes about a deal. WRONG. Flim flam con man. Snake oil salesman.
2706 2018-08-07 19:10:36 Canada has the 3rd largest oil reserves on the planet.  Saudi Arabia threatening to cut off exports should be like Pepsi telling Coke were not going to buy you Soda.  #cndpoli
2707 2018-08-07 19:10:22 Hi, we understand you've put your trust in Walmart to provide your oil change. We would like to hear more about the location you visited, and the car troubles you've been having. Would you mind sending a DM with further details including contact information?

2712 2018-08-07 19:09:58 Thanks @Walmart for breaking a piece of my engine instead of changing my battery and oil

2714 2018-08-07 19:09:50 Commodities may be physical goods such as oil or gold as in this case that are traded whereas futures are contracts to buy and sell things in the future usually at agreed prices but delivered and paid for later. There is a difference .
2715 2018-08-07 19:09:27 I started taking CBD oil and now I’m able to sleep again at night. Haven’t had any nightmares about H affair since taking it either. Anxiety has gone down a bit also.

2719 2018-08-07 19:09:03 India has altrntives like Iraq wch has a better quality oil also Saudi is gonna incrse production so as Russia & other countries..import might decease but India will find it's ways to keep dealing with Iran as it's not only about oil import but it's also strategic partnr of India

2721 2018-08-07 19:08:47 #ukog #weald $75 closing in.
French Societe Generale has already estimated that the sanctions will remove 1 million bpd of Iranian oil from global markets, and yesterday a Goldman Sachs analyst told Bloomberg that the bank expected a “very, very tight oil market”l

2726 2018-08-07 19:08:11 Sorry, Ken. Did the world suddenly stop using oil over the long weekend? Crap, I must have missed that memo...
2727 2018-08-07 19:08:09 If Canada supported Human Rights we wouldn't be buying their oil and supplying them with arms.

2737 2018-08-07 19:07:02 You do realize that the Oilsands are only a part of the AB energy mix, don't you? 
Both AB & SK have vast reserves of conventional oil that the current Irving infrastructure can work with.
2738 2018-08-07 19:06:50 I will agree that Trump should focus on ending the use of oil and gasses. The electric car will help save our planet and yet Americans are too self obsorbed to understand that the Elite make most thier money raiding countries for oil, if we switch to electric, no more oil raids!
2739 2018-08-07 19:06:45 New treasure chest to check out for me. Looks to be some heavenly, luxurious products. Just checked the website. Divine Xmas gifts at @friendlysoapltd Very ethical, natural company. Gone natural on products since i heard of palm oil and orangutan crime. Shea butter. #soak

2741 2018-08-07 19:06:33 Is world energy demand going up or down?  Does the world use oil and Nat gas?  Will Russia and Saudi Arabia provide if we do not?  So how is using our energy increasing climate change if we are providing it where others would have if we didn't?
2742 2018-08-07 19:06:32 @PrinceMartin_  watermelon oil
2743 2018-08-07 19:06:31 The Don just slapped new sanctions on Iran. The mullahs are obligated to push back. I think that is enough headwinds for oil futures.
2744 2018-08-07 19:06:18 I think they are the only European country without debt because they were wise with their oil reserves , so maybe they are in a better position then most to invest in health . My last boss was Norwegian - calm, wise people
2745 2018-08-07 19:06:10 Reham Khan @RehamKhan1 can really be beneficial for Pakistan. Let’s invite her here. she goes so low & can help us find oil reserves or natural gas #RehamKhan

$25million deal being satisfied with $0.20ct stock. Can’t see it trading @ $0.03 for long “IF” they can close this deal
2747 2018-08-07 19:05:59 Perhaps the time has come for Canadian energy to supply our domestic needs? Saudi Arabia currently supplies 15% of Canada’s #oil imports in the east. News Flash - #Alberta and #Saskatchewan can meet that demand!
#cdnpoli #abpoli #KeepCanadaWorking
2748 2018-08-07 19:05:59 In which @tomemmer defends the oil industry ... at #FarmFest18 "let [ethanol] compete with [oil] on a fair basis" ... is Tom Emmer even from Minnesota?
2749 2018-08-07 19:05:58 That pretty much blows the “Big Oil is Out to Get Tesla” theory, doesn’t it?
2750 2018-08-07 19:05:56 Texas sharpshooter fallacy Walter.. Rather have my oil -which we all still need no matter how much we would all prefer renewables, from a highly regulated sector and a modern westernised government. Thank you
2751 2018-08-07 19:05:50 The Saudi frigate, the Al-Dammam, was hit in an unspecified type attack off the Yemeni coast of Hodeidah. Two Saudi oil tankers were also hit. #Yemen #SaudiArabia
2752 2018-08-07 19:05:47 Probably not necessary then. I only take multi and fish oil. They make me feel better. I’ve been slacking though with probiotics cuz sorting out gut problems and working outside all day aren’t a good combo lmao
2753 2018-08-07 19:05:44 Such as? Give examples so we can consider the consequences.

That "chainsaw" trope is needing some sharpening and chain oil, 'cause it don't mean a thing anymore.
2754 2018-08-07 19:05:41 This oil exploration news is giving me that water kit feeling
2755 2018-08-07 19:05:41 A piece of friendly advice:

 Stop tweeting about the environment while we own a leaky oil pipeline that you want to expand to triple the output of the tar sands.
2756 2018-08-07 19:05:29 Oil k bagher aag lagany ka talent dekhari han madam 
2757 2018-08-07 19:05:28 Yep. His "business" is nothing more than performance art for the easily fooled, a modern day snake oil salesman.
2758 2018-08-07 19:05:18 Capitalism housed and fed the world. Vested interests are the enemy of Capitalism it destroys houses and crops to keep prices high. Example, plastic can be turned back to oil and reused, cleaning up plastic pollution but oil companies don't want it so it don't happen.
2759 2018-08-07 19:05:10 the oil change ppl luv trying 2 scam me into getting all the extra expensive shit i don’t need so then i end up calling my daddy to figure out wtf im paying for lolz
2760 2018-08-07 19:05:08 I did olive oil, parmesan, and garlic. Super yum!
2761 2018-08-07 19:05:07 No oil

Pre-scrub your grill while it heats up

Brush your chicken with marinade during cooking if you have any, or season during it
2762 2018-08-07 19:05:06 Not so dumb, when you think about it. You are sitting on hundreds of billions in oil. How do you hedge it? You buy $TSLA....
2763 2018-08-07 19:05:02 and rubbed coconut oil
2764 2018-08-07 19:04:43 Turning the once part-time economy into a full time economy. 
People are quitting two part time jobs to take one full time. There for leaving openings. Also the oil and manufacturing booms happening. Great opportunities for the American worker.
2765 2018-08-07 19:04:15 A lot of pre Trump job growth was due to the Dakota oil fields (& other independent entrepreneurial businesses) despite the Obama obstructive administration.
2766 2018-08-07 19:04:15 Cars are fucking expensive  go for a simple oil change and although I knew there was a leak somewhere I didn’t expect it to end up costing almost $400 at the end of it all because they gotta replace 2 things now
2767 2018-08-07 19:03:53 Oil is a mineral that is naturaly reproduced .
2768 2018-08-07 19:03:51 No, I have come accross snake oil salesmen waffling about carnivorous diets though.
2769 2018-08-07 19:03:48 I guess it's to hedge their oil position...
2770 2018-08-07 19:03:45 @fordnation Mr Ford... Oil is under $70.00 a barrel... Gas is $1.35...When oil was at $120.00 per barrel, gas was at $1.20....We are being gouged, big time. I think it's time for you step in and investigate these oil companies...
2771 2018-08-07 19:03:35 Post the Saudi Sovereign wealth fund investment of $2 bln in TSLA, does anyone have the "Texas Hedge" trade on for Short Oil & long TSLA?

2776 2018-08-07 19:03:08 Does Big Oil Accelerate Climate Change?
2777 2018-08-07 19:03:03 You could say the same about Saudi Arabia big difference is they have more oil and they suppress their women. Iran is one of the most educated populations next to Israel in the ME. Yes even women. It was foolish to drop the Iran deal. We hope u lose ur seat
2778 2018-08-07 19:02:58 Get my oil changed, now.

2780 2018-08-07 19:02:46 When we see the kinds of civilizational clashes between #SaudiArabia and #Canada, we have to recognize the importance of not relying on a theocratic despotism for oil.  We must pursue energy independence.
2781 2018-08-07 19:02:35 As soon as I find the olive oil, we're gonna be cooking today, ladies

A net-off of losses will still give Israel (Jews expelled) wealth equivalent to over 70% of Iraq's oil worth.
2784 2018-08-07 19:02:21 Just discovered toffees with mastic oil (bought in error by my husband) - hmmm an interesting flavour. However one benefit is that mastic oil is good for snake bites. I shall just go and find a snake... #bitter #pineflavour
2785 2018-08-07 19:02:17 No other auto manufacturer is considering the all inclusive picture of what’s necessary to end oil now before it is too late For our environment.
2786 2018-08-07 19:02:14 cockroaches always find their way into cool oil, and match boxes always find their way into water
2787 2018-08-07 19:02:13 Zero shame. I’d rub that dude down with coconut oil.
2788 2018-08-07 19:02:11 The Russian State may call itself a capitalist society, but it doesn’t operate as such. Putin is a communist, ruling with an iron fist. He runs the banks, the oil companies & the media. PS-he kills on foreign soil.
2789 2018-08-07 19:02:02 Thank you Elon we’ve bought stock at $20-30 a share and only sold some to buy our 3’s!  Please every day I watch the gamers play this stock and the big oil nay sayers bad mouth it. Tesla should be over $400/share already.
2790 2018-08-07 19:01:56 Coconut shouldn't be eaten it should only be used as an oil
2791 2018-08-07 19:01:50 Fuck, Saudi Arabia, their backward theocracy needs to be fixed, but as long as they're controlling a portion of the world's oil they'll always have power.
2792 2018-08-07 19:01:50 Conceptually, though, isn’t it right to think of oil from stimulated reservoirs as lower-carbon oil? If one otherwise-emitted carbon atom is stored underground for every two coming out, I’ve reduced the carbon intensity of oil by 50%, no?

2802 2018-08-07 19:00:48 assuming to knowing what ingredients you have on hand... use some sugar and olive oil in a bowl and mix together. Then exfoliate your hands with the mixture and rinse. #TuesdayThoughts
2803 2018-08-07 19:00:38 It’s only $4 billion in trade. You can’t lock up and torture our citizens. Get fucked Saudi Arabia. We won’t bend over like other countries. We don’t need your oil.

2808 2018-08-07 19:00:09 Hahah, learn the difference between oil and gas genius. 

Then learn the difference between export and domestic consumption

2812 2018-08-07 18:59:55 Then we definitely need to shut down all toilet paper exports to Canada...aye.

Careful what you wish for...around 40% of their exports are oil and natural gas. What is it we have become the world's leading producer of...oh yeah, oil and gas.
2813 2018-08-07 18:59:47 Cooking Twitter fam, I need advice.

I have two chicken breasts that I'm going to cook on the gas grill soon.
BUT I've never used a gas grill in my life.

Grilling advice? Do you need oil? After I'm done grilling, you turn it up to burn off the excess right...???
2814 2018-08-07 18:59:35 The oil that is found in poison ivy is called "urushiol."
2815 2018-08-07 18:59:34 A bit flowery but she's not wrong. Pearls are ridiculously susceptible to erosion and destruction by chemical means. Even skin oil can severely damage them!
2816 2018-08-07 18:59:24 More like rubber in black engine oil
2817 2018-08-07 18:59:22 It would be the CBD oil...never had it and curious if help with May anxiety @FordDandy @jennyscheldt
2818 2018-08-07 18:59:13 I don't know if it is the Peppermint Essential oil or someone has a lucky charm shoved up somewhere, but 30+ hands of Texas Hold'em Poker including at least one pair per hand has to be some kind of record. Different dealer and different shuffle method each hand.
2819 2018-08-07 18:59:12 I may have broken my car by waiting too long to change the oil. Will find out tonight
2820 2018-08-07 18:59:09 Oil Competitors trying to buy @Tesla to nip in the bud concept of pollution free world! Resist!
2821 2018-08-07 18:59:07 We don’t pay double for Canadian oil, but the Americans pay just over 1/2 for our Canadian oil because environmentalists have stopped our oil from getting to shoreline, to sell our oil to other countries, to give us more money to build more refineries. Vicious cycle
2822 2018-08-07 18:59:00 BIG OIL CONSPIRACY (Except the Saudis. They're cool.)
2823 2018-08-07 18:58:59 You are lucky to have good passport and visa. Difficult to swallow that you were missused  and abandoned by rich donors of regime change project for Syria oil,gas,water,land, Golan, regional power. Billions $ spent in vein, millions of Syrians displaced, many cities ruined.
2824 2018-08-07 18:58:46 Fantastic!! We used to see the Orca's most days when I worked on an oil rig off Sable Island. Everyone was in awe of them. They'd roll on their side and look up at you. They're people!
2825 2018-08-07 18:58:40 I take either an oil/grease or butter and melt it into the pan first, then I crack my eggs into a bowl like you would to scramble (check for shells), season to taste and pour into the pan! I try to fry the bottom as long as possible to keep the yolks in tact when flipping
2826 2018-08-07 18:58:40 coal is longterm dead but the intermittenacy problem is non-trival and lithium batteries aren't enough to make up for transportation deficit (cars are easy planes and boats less so). Oil still a problem

thorium powered container ships would utterly rule tho
2827 2018-08-07 18:58:40 What the hell did I miss?! How the bloody hell have you burnt that?? Do you generate that much friction dear, maybe some oil might help?!
2828 2018-08-07 18:58:28 You mean where will our eastern brethren get their oil??
2829 2018-08-07 18:58:22 If @rehamkhan1 stoops any lower she will discover oil reserves.  #Pakistan

2831 2018-08-07 18:58:03 I wouldn’t bother anyway, it’s like watching it as an oil painting. #nonHD
2832 2018-08-07 18:57:59 Will never happen, no way to get western Canada oil to eastern Canada - never - if anything the US will replace Saudi oil - like how they doubled exports to Canada under climate hero fraud Obama while he blocked KXL, he built US pipelines while blocking Canadian pipelines
2833 2018-08-07 18:57:52 We're all going to get rich off rubes buying low grade overpriced snake oil?
2834 2018-08-07 18:57:47 @realDonaldTrump Please keep the gas prices under $3.00 per gallon~ The VOTERS will blame Republicans for HIGH oil prices, especially those who live in CA, NY, NJ and states where prices have been below $2.70 per gallon. We want more Republicans in the Senate/House
2835 2018-08-07 18:57:38 Thank you for the mention Kathryn—so happy you’re enjoying the FAB butter. I use it everyday, with the oil and deodorant 
2836 2018-08-07 18:57:26 I checked out the Josh Wood costs the other day but I think that's a bit much even for me! I am not 100% sure what impact it has had, I've just restocked with Clarins Lotus Oil and am not sure i'll get the Zelens again (unless my face suddenly gets worse when I stop!).

2841 2018-08-07 18:56:56 If we want a chance at managing this situation the @GOP must be voted out and neutered.  They will destroy our planet before standing up to oil and industry. #VoteBlue2018 and beyond.
2842 2018-08-07 18:56:39 Nah. I want the oil not the e liquid
2843 2018-08-07 18:56:26 Down the road from Midland.  It's s very small town in the middle of the oil BS. Haha.  And lots of Wind Turbines.
2844 2018-08-07 18:56:24 The garlic oil is perfection on a pizza.
2845 2018-08-07 18:56:21 @USTreasury : Our honorable President Trump is correct , BUT , Iran has it own huge natural resources in minerals and huge money from past business to develop anything like our Texas oil boom.
2846 2018-08-07 18:56:20 Bonus: In all my brilliance I put olive oil in the bath so my skin was soft af and hydrated, but I had to stand in the middle of the floor for like 10 minutes trying to dry. In retrospect i could’ve towel scooted to the closet, but I didn’t think of doing that until just now.
2847 2018-08-07 18:56:07 If you went through life like he did, in a part of Kenya like where he calls home, you would be lucky to write and talk in english. let him and their oil be. Learn to respect people and that which is theirs
2848 2018-08-07 18:55:52 I check oil on the old cars, but I expect the warning lights to do their job these days!
2849 2018-08-07 18:55:45 So the problem lies primarily with capitalists and right wing neoliberal governments fucking with em and because they didn't diversify their economy, resulting in dependence on oil exports, not their wildly successful social programs that helped millions out of poverty.
2850 2018-08-07 18:55:38 Recent events with #SaudiArabia and with the current #canadian Government interest in pipelines, is now a good time for Canada’s private sector as well as Canada’s Goverment to get into the refinement game harder. Let’s get off import oil. #alberta #cdnpoli
2851 2018-08-07 18:55:26 We can't dig that oil because of some law which my late father told me
2852 2018-08-07 18:55:25 lmk how i just got charged 74 dollars for an oil change lol
2853 2018-08-07 18:55:20 Oil logs modest gain as Iranian sanctions add to fear of supply disruptions
2854 2018-08-07 18:55:11 It’s naive to think that all right-wing social media propaganda on Puerto Rico is solely of PNP (statehood party) origin when Trump, GOP, Dems, the Junta, US military, corporations, neolibs, neocons, oil & gas barons, Wall St, etc have very similar or MORE REACTIONARY interests.
2855 2018-08-07 18:55:08 Ya in terms of a reliable tune I think I'm fine. It's just a matter of keeping the power train warranty even if they're doing an oil change they can check the computer if they really wanted too.
2856 2018-08-07 18:55:07 saudis are going to buy it, shut it down, and use the IP to stop electric cars, to keep the price of oil up
2857 2018-08-07 18:55:05 NRA has polluted America with guns. Same damage caused by An oil spill or a nuclear disaster. Greed and profit are the motive.
2858 2018-08-07 18:55:04 Yes it is.  Just as it was with Standard Oil’s breakup.
2859 2018-08-07 18:54:57 Is this done with Greek olive oil?

2862 2018-08-07 18:54:53 Thanks. Would Jackson’s own Alkyd oil medium be compatible?
2863 2018-08-07 18:54:51 I’m never changing my oil myself again. I’m sitting in my truck and i don’t have to do anything but pop the hood and pay for it. Wow.
2864 2018-08-07 18:54:45 @TheAJayII please react to oil of every pearls un-insides
2865 2018-08-07 18:54:42 Lastly (promise) how can u be sure it’s ‘them’ that have pol. agenda, not ‘you’? Action on CC would hurt oil ind.
2866 2018-08-07 18:54:27 Threddy, use fractionated coconut oil by DoTerra essential oils.  It has no smell.  Plus it’s AMAZING for your reptilian skin. It always stays as a liquid and not as thick as baby oil or mineral oil.  You will love.
2867 2018-08-07 18:54:24 Go to the Infowars website and you can get all the snake oil you want.
2868 2018-08-07 18:54:24 I tweet about food, wine and olive oil all day and you guys want me to explain IG stories??... leave me out of it

2871 2018-08-07 18:54:10 Jim Womack says oil & gas Commission must go on field trip to Bradford County, Pa. or WV to see fracking operations. Again no mention of how to pay for it. @NCPolicyWatch #ncpol

Meanwhile, wealthy people, esp those who are wealthy from oil/gas, are innocent victims, who sit quietly in a huddle, worried about their future. But don’t worry, they would never, ever resort to fraud, collusion or conspiracy to keep their wealth.

Flat Earth anyone...? 
2878 2018-08-07 18:53:34 The vOIL CARTEL and ESPECIALLY the 5 Refineries that comprise the MONOPOLY on OIL Refining in the USA will USE this as an EXCUSE ton RAISE PRICES!
2879 2018-08-07 18:53:33 Nah they don’t care, they stay charging $600 for an oil change hahahaha
2880 2018-08-07 18:53:25 Stupid! I will not debate the KKK about their right to stand up for their race.  I will not debate climate change is real with oil and gas Lobbyists with an agenda to make money, and I won’t debate with the Christian righ that trump is the savior, and god sent him here!
2881 2018-08-07 18:53:23 Coconut oil?? On your face??
2882 2018-08-07 18:53:18 Good thing no previous Conservative government ever took a drop of Saudi oil.

2888 2018-08-07 18:52:55 Both. But peanut oil is ok aparrently because the processing removes the allergens. Still, I try to stay away from all nuts as they’re processed on the same equipment. I eat sunflower seeds in the form of tahini instead and it has similar benefits.

2891 2018-08-07 18:52:27 The illegal SANCTIONS against IRAN are done because a request by SAUDI ARABIA,  to prevent IRAN from selling its OIL ,to create a,violent CIVIL unrest in IRAN, leading to an all out WAR provoked by ISRAEL,with the hopes of a REGIME change which will never happen,  IRAN I
will not
2892 2018-08-07 18:52:26 I don't think they denied that. In terms of my politics, I'm center-right (probably?) but I don't think we should ignore other factors on the Venezuelan question: the death of Hugo Chavez (Maduro may be a bad leader), the fall in the oil price etc. I am more for a mixed economy.
2893 2018-08-07 18:52:22 Most excited and least happy in the same sentence? Like plantain chips in hot oil?
2894 2018-08-07 18:52:21 The squeaky wheel doesn’t always get the oil. Sometimes it just gets replaced.
2895 2018-08-07 18:52:21 Me too, always a widow who is military or works for big oil like Exxon etc.
2896 2018-08-07 18:52:20 THANK YOU. ITS NOT A GOOD SUBSTITUTE, COCONUT OIL DOES NOT FIX EVERYTHING
2897 2018-08-07 18:52:19 Took it for oil change, alignment and a couple other things. Didn’t do the alignment so I had to wait and then I get in my car to notice both seats adjusted and close to 50 miles added to odometer when a test drive is 5 miles...
2898 2018-08-07 18:52:11 Spot pricing, and don't sign a contract. Compare prices once a year. Fuel oil companies rely on lock-in, and give their long-time customers worse prices than what they offer to poach their competitors' customers.

2909 2018-08-07 18:50:47 Where is Bob on calling out Canada purchasing oil from 3rd world dictators?  Right, he’s silent.
2910 2018-08-07 18:50:34 What about Economic or Financial deals that we are presently negotiating with countries that buy oil from Iran like China and other European countries
2911 2018-08-07 18:50:24 here's a radical out of the box idea, build then refine the Canadian Oil in Canada and then sell it. is that too radical an idea for the Liberals and the Progressive Conservatives in Ottawa?

2913 2018-08-07 18:50:17 Climate change is who can get away from oil first. That is another huge contributer to the crisis we're facing. Climate change will affect the troops as well. What do you think people in the most hard hit regions are going to start doing? We don't need to worry about name changes
2914 2018-08-07 18:50:07 And by "exfoliate" they usually mean a physical exfoliant (prob some diy sugar scrub) and not an AHA or BHA. 

Do you want microtears? Because that's how you get microtears.

Also, viscerally cringing at coconut oil. Oh..no...
2915 2018-08-07 18:49:59 It’s actually terrifying how little people know about their own cars.... if you don’t know how to *at least* check your oil and change your tire... idk about you...
2916 2018-08-07 18:49:57 Of course, HUGE oil money there!
2917 2018-08-07 18:49:52 Come on now you know these are the same people that though That there was a gas shortage last year remember? I don’t think people really understand how much oil Texas really does have.  Gas shortages

On the flip side, I knew my shop in W-S was the one when Dad took me to get my oil changed, and the mechanics talked to me instead of Dad
2923 2018-08-07 18:49:23 Netanyahu and Putin both want the Shia gone. Trump's taken the same stand. The enemy of my enemy is however I see it at the time, said some old wise man, wrinkled from oil money.
2924 2018-08-07 18:49:15 Definitely watching to see your thoughts on the fund idea...this was definitely unexpected, but would certainly limit exposure to Big Oil manipulation attempts...

2936 2018-08-07 18:48:08 Pipelines that are now leaking under native American reservations. Also unless you invested in oil doesn't benefit you. Nk trump, admitted in a tweet earlier was not denuclearizing, isis is not gone. Jerusalem removed us as a fair arbiter , and didn't end the conflict. Vetran...
2937 2018-08-07 18:47:49 Nope if you exclude oil SA is the richest in the world.
2938 2018-08-07 18:47:37 No, no, genuinely wondering. Trying it out myself and didn't realise how effective beard oil is so wouldn't mind buying something a bit...cheaper than I have...
2939 2018-08-07 18:47:36 I know they charged me $55 for an oil change like bro Ive got this done for less
2940 2018-08-07 18:47:32 Yes, even as someone who leans more to the JLP, I was a little embarrassed by that article. If the oil hedge was stopped, logic would dictate that either the tax should be rolled back; or you change the name and indicate what exactly it will be used for.
2941 2018-08-07 18:47:30 My face is an oil today
2942 2018-08-07 18:47:28 As much as i dont support that kind of descision from the govt., Oil wrestling is nothing like that. You are more homophobic than you think...
2943 2018-08-07 18:47:19 Fresh out the shower, coconut oil in my beard... bout to light up and cook on this beautiful day off of mine 
2944 2018-08-07 18:47:14 Arabs hedging on their oil with a bet on TSLA?
2945 2018-08-07 18:47:07 my skin is so dry i could literally use it as a notepad think i need to deep myself in a pool full of bio oil..kanti ngizothini

2948 2018-08-07 18:47:02 pakai apa bagus nak hilangkan parut? bio oil ke?
2949 2018-08-07 18:47:01 I've also learned that research doesn't always support real lived experience and can also be biased sometimes. And yes, I studied science a lot. Many ease leg cramps with mag "oil" in the groups I've seen.
2950 2018-08-07 18:47:00 And asking for everything under the sun when oil was way up.
2951 2018-08-07 18:46:59 So bring in Town for other reasons, I went to see Thomas Cole Eden to empire at the national gallery. It was a bit tricky to find, going through the caff, through a room of lovely landscape oil sketches (lord leighton, my favourite) and then into the exhibition.
2952 2018-08-07 18:46:51 And the tea tree oil
2953 2018-08-07 18:46:45 Gas & oil are to the vehicle that seeks to move as perspective & positivity are to the vessel that seeks to improve. #TuesdayThoughts
2954 2018-08-07 18:46:35 More like the one where the frogs are turning gay.  
Or more like the snake oil you sell actually does anything positive.
2955 2018-08-07 18:46:34 Canada is oozing with oil and gas. It's time to tap into it. We don't need scum one horse countries like that for thing we already have plenty of. Probably as much as for a matter of fact.

2960 2018-08-07 18:46:16 It would be the ultimate irony.  Oil rich bomb buying country that started letting women drive like yesterday.
2961 2018-08-07 18:46:15 My causes go to our armed forces and veterans.  Climate change is a race of who can get to the oil first, so far Russia is ahead I think. We need more research into why it has gone from ice age to global warming to climate change. They can't make up their minds 
2962 2018-08-07 18:45:48 Just switched to @bareMinerals foundation and I am in love! I’ve been wearing it for 7 hours and there’s no oil or patches 
2963 2018-08-07 18:45:44 So Saudi oil money is going to buy Tesla, just like it bought Al Gore’s company. You are all suckers!
2964 2018-08-07 18:45:38 Western oil comes from icky TAR sands. Saudi oil comes from dead dinosaurs. They're dead, so it is much cleaner.

2974 2018-08-07 18:44:30 I’ve been using the SIMPLE sensitive face wash and honestly it’s the only face cleanser that has ever worked, doesn’t leave my face dry like when I use natural lemon soap. But both feel really clean afterwards.. but babe I’ve been using vitamin E oil and Marula oil combined and..
2975 2018-08-07 18:44:26 We pay taxes now and what do we get in return? We get endless war in the middle east, we subsidize the oil industry, we bail out big banks, and we fund huge tax cuts for the rich. How about we stop those things and use the money for education, Healthcare, and our infrastructure?
2976 2018-08-07 18:44:23 Saudi Arabia has been granted disproportionate influence because of its oil reserves/military bases. That county has never had human rights, gender equality or free speech. It’s trappings of modernity have been purchased. Modern is unknown to its elite leaders.
2977 2018-08-07 18:44:18 Lol...how about oil spattering to the face(eyes)
2978 2018-08-07 18:44:09 Yep! It came with pack of butter flavored oil and kennels. The bag says "vegan" but I'm skeptical. But we have oil and kernels too.
2979 2018-08-07 18:44:02 EU is in a tight position they just did a free trade deal with Japan euro has been taking a hit since they still need to adjust and recover from that . Oil from Iran is cheaper if they concede and get oil supply else it will be more costly .
2980 2018-08-07 18:43:42 I learnt today that if you wear wigs a lot or weaves,you should use grapeseed oil for your hair
2981 2018-08-07 18:43:42 Overdue for an oil change? I'll get to it. Crack in the windshield? I can live with that. Blinker light on the verge of dying? Will deal.

Convertible top acting strangely? HOW SOON CAN I GET IN FOR SERVICE??!!??
2982 2018-08-07 18:43:34 I dunno, why do we import 100,000 barrels of oil per day from Saudi Arabia and sell them arms?
2983 2018-08-07 18:43:34 Need a oil change
2984 2018-08-07 18:43:33 Still convinced that second map is a hipster map of beard oil outlets
2985 2018-08-07 18:43:33 Man even vegans hate coleslaw wtf is up with that, its refreshing af after like an oil spill in ur throat get outta here.
2986 2018-08-07 18:43:22 So the very very modest social reforms helped out the population by a ton before we pulled another Chile on em. Don't deny that they had other problems, should've diversified their export to not mainly on oil and others. But it wasn't "socialism" that did this.
2987 2018-08-07 18:43:16 Sure, the government’s ROI is an exponentially growing network of electric chargers to reduce dependence on oil. Hopefully a lot more to come.
2988 2018-08-07 18:43:08 It's like having oil, but they don't improve their own countries, even south american countries with oil aren't that poor
2989 2018-08-07 18:43:05 That is a lie made up by Obama. Haha now I see you are just a parrot. Do you know who put sanctions on Iran that blocked them from oil sales money, in the first place? Obama did, then he made up this phony deal that they didn’t sign. He lifted sanctions and gave them billions..
2990 2018-08-07 18:42:58 Yes and no ...Yes Mecca is the centre of the muslim faith but its weird that Saudi has so many differing approaches to the muslim faith, some traditional some modern but the rest of the countries in the Saudi peninsula are more progressive...And we buy oil from them too

3003 2018-08-07 18:41:48 You need to read something more current on China than the Little Red Book. China will lead the world in renewables, while we turn to coal and offshore oil.

3015 2018-08-07 18:40:26 Giles’ picture implies energy is exclusively provided by fossil fuels, as a sole provider of the energy needed in modern society. 

And let’s not pretend that the oil companies hate each other more than they hate proponents of anthropogenic climate change.
3016 2018-08-07 18:40:18 @JonErlichman So with Canada shipping 4 million barrels of oil per day why dont we build refineries to process into fuel???
With price of gasoline how could it not be profitable over 20-25 year life of refinery?

They work closely with local community co-operatives in Crete to produce their high quality products & ingredients.
3019 2018-08-07 18:40:08 Haha. I’m guessing that’s coz of the small old field auction and plenty on these small oil fields coming online over the next 1 year..will do some research maybe thu.

3038 2018-08-07 18:38:06 It only took $2bn for the $TSLA bulls to fall in love with an oppressive religious death cult's oil money.
3039 2018-08-07 18:38:06 Where did you read that BS? Or is this just a rumour among your six followers? Oil demand continues to rise every year with no reliable “green” alternatives able to replace it. Wind and solar critter killers are of little help in a Canadian winter.
3040 2018-08-07 18:38:04 Our govt, under multiple prez’s, has spent trillions on illegal wars so oil companies & weapons makers can make obscene profits. No wonder then, w/lack of regard for human life, as well as the environment, we’re under-equipped & understaffed for every crazy large fire in America.

3043 2018-08-07 18:37:48 New car battery acquired and installed. Also got my oil change. Next is tires and fan motor.
3044 2018-08-07 18:37:41 It’s only “obtained more responsibly” when the oil isn’t being stolen from Indigenous land, when oil extraction and transportation is done with Indigenous consent, and when Indigenous land isn’t being destroyed/contaminated/etc.
3045 2018-08-07 18:37:25 Butts & Trudeau are willing to send billions to mid-east despots and spill Canadian blood in Mali or elsewhere for a vote from them in the corrupt UN. For political reasons they cancelled Canadian pipeline projects that would have freed us from SA oil imports

3051 2018-08-07 18:37:06 If you think about it, financing a $TSLA buyout would be a genius move by the Saudis - in one swoop they move $70B of oil wealth into a leading solar energy/EV play.

3061 2018-08-07 18:36:07 Its right up there with, (1)bringing back DDT & other banned chemicals, (2) oil drilling & mining on protected land, & (3) selling out America to foreign powers. All that & more Trump has done. He & his supporters will chip away, bit by bit, until our world is no longer liveable.

3066 2018-08-07 18:35:32 On the other hand, you're already so good at everything else you may not want to bother with learning a whole new medium.  I am never going to learn to oil paint in this lifetime, I finally realized the other day.

Alex Jones Demands His Infowars Followers Rise Up and Buy More Snake Oil

3078 2018-08-07 18:34:21 How is he a complete bullshitter? 

Because he lies? 

Like Obama about Obamacare, overseas bombings, taxes, or funding? 

Like Bush about overseas wars, oil grabs, public world events, taxes? 

I’d say compared to the 2 listed, he ain’t doing much harm.
3079 2018-08-07 18:34:17 Once the world stops buying their dirty oil would send a clearer message.
3080 2018-08-07 18:34:10 Is she going to help you put oil rigs in Lake Tahoe?
3081 2018-08-07 18:34:07 The display is a soft plastic. It’s very porous, so I doubt that oil is goin anywhere
3082 2018-08-07 18:34:00 How to refresh a mattress? Add a few drops of essential oil to baking soda, mix, sprinkle on, and one hour later, vacuum off.
3083 2018-08-07 18:33:59 Building parking structure no one uses-$20 mil

Building a new airport after the oil boom-$50 mil

Building a new jail-$30 mil

Coming up with a City of Minot Budget- Priceless

3085 2018-08-07 18:33:58 So it’s sourdough, olive oil, Parmesan & vino time 
3086 2018-08-07 18:33:54 I also read that the natural oil in roses is great for healing scars as well!
3087 2018-08-07 18:33:48 @beautybakerie since my awake and Bake oil isn’t here just yet, can I substitute it for the Farsáli rose gold elixir?
3088 2018-08-07 18:33:40 I know it's actually scary how some people can be so easily deceived
The internet and social media enabled big oil to create this mass ignorance
I simply can't believe how effective they've been
3089 2018-08-07 18:33:34 Lotion. Oil. Cream. WHATEVER. Use it. Man. Woman. Child.
3090 2018-08-07 18:33:34 Taking the cultural stuff out of the equation for the moment. The real issue is that we are dependent on oil and that comes from ... where their religion is ... Just saying.
3091 2018-08-07 18:33:33 No it wouldnt. Not with the lying Liberals in power. They would rather import oil from unethical countries like Saudi Arabia and Iran
3092 2018-08-07 18:33:31 Hopefully this will dissuade you from supporting Trump's offshore oil drilling schemes, if you don't oppose them already.
3093 2018-08-07 18:33:28 We don't really need to see pictures of you in a business suit, sitting with other men in suits, to know that your ONLY interest is to protect other men in suits and their corporate big oil/coal/chem/gas $$$. #SAD #PlanetBeforeProfit #Resign
3094 2018-08-07 18:33:24 If we had free market, at least we'd have other options to ponder and create. If it's oil, then it's oil. We should capitalize on our strengths, not worry about competition. We need to show we have the best and the payoff will follow, if we don't, back to the drawing board.
3095 2018-08-07 18:33:22 I’m so tired and I still gotta go get an oil change before I can lay down.
3096 2018-08-07 18:33:01 I’ve been at it with Saudis since the other night. It’s been quite amusing. They seem to think we’re heavily dependent on them for oil.
3097 2018-08-07 18:33:00 I use coconut oil with aloe Vera gel, it's totally natural and does the same job without all the harmful toxins In The sun creams you recommend.
3098 2018-08-07 18:32:56 Felt like being lazy today so I figured I’d bring my car in and use my free oil change, so far, it’s been 2 hours, I need new rotors, pads, front driver side ball joint, right rear tire rod and an alignment. Every time I ask questions they just tell me something else is wrong
3099 2018-08-07 18:32:42 It's the last day to get our Craft Oil Cartridges on sale! Stop in today! 
3100 2018-08-07 18:32:41 One day oil will run out, what are you going to do then Saudi Arabia!
3101 2018-08-07 18:32:40 so is Canada's oil when talking about revenue but Alberta's oil when pandering to environmentalists and first nations ... pretty slick CBC ...
3102 2018-08-07 18:32:36 Also, and no one’s talking about this, these platforms are hopefully protecting rubes from buying Jones’ snake oil health and survivalist products...that way they’ll have more $$$ for saving and consumption of stuff that won’t make horrible people unnecessarily wealthy
3103 2018-08-07 18:32:23 Will work with Russia. And I'm thinking part of Trump's deal is to participate in the profits. Believe some where I saw 10%. And if I am wrong and this makes him look even worse than he is......oh well!!!! 
Just another oil well!!!!
3104 2018-08-07 18:32:19 Ab mzy bnd is bar bat ko oil lga k.......teri......mein ......dein ge
3105 2018-08-07 18:32:16 An oil imbrago against Iran helps Russia the most. Their income relies heavily on the price of oil.

3107 2018-08-07 18:31:32 I have a question, how do you get rid of a oil or some sort of film like stuff on the Switch screen? I tried disinfecting wipe like the ones that r used to clean a spot before testing for your sugar. Thank you
3108 2018-08-07 18:31:20 we went to papa Jim’s and my mom bought me a cleansing candle and some success bath oil potion it’s time to prosper

Cut from a different cloth 
I was dipped in rare oil
3110 2018-08-07 18:31:17 It makes sense when you get specific. We must destroy their economy because they (particularly poor people) are benefitting from it. We can’t let our oil profits be diverted to education or a broader economy.

3122 2018-08-07 18:30:14 hehe yeah me too! i love mickey mouse, and oil panic is from when dad was a young dude. haven't checked if mickey and donald works yet. need batteries
3123 2018-08-07 18:30:12 All that oil making my stomach hurt
3124 2018-08-07 18:30:08 Maybe the closet is too full or it needs oil?
3125 2018-08-07 18:30:05 Have just mixed white truffle oil and @HendersonsRel to make a marinade. Half wondering if the gods of cooking are about to smite me
3126 2018-08-07 18:30:04 What a tragedy for those people, in the past Venezuela received people from all over the world, they took the infamous profit of the oil wealth and now they do this
3127 2018-08-07 18:30:03 Jiffy Lube employees are the most aggressive up sellers of all time . Bruh just change my oil
3128 2018-08-07 18:30:00 Crazy, does that mean I own big oil???
3129 2018-08-07 18:29:57 So the Prince is throwing his oil producing country under the bus?
3130 2018-08-07 18:29:55 Was cooking chicken wings and the oil just popped on me from outta nowhere, ain't making shit again
3131 2018-08-07 18:29:38 Next they will be on PTV holding a bottle of dirty oil.. I remember that scene from 40 years ago..

3134 2018-08-07 18:29:33 I'm sure vlady has a scheme going already. he can move oil through russia, skim some $ off the top. trumps a fool.
3135 2018-08-07 18:29:32 when you run out of oil that would drive a woman mad 
3136 2018-08-07 18:29:26 Didn't even hear about this event and I live in Southall. Most of the homes on my street are all rented with multiple occupants. And they all fly tip. It's disgusting. I've seen food thrown out, car oil, cat litter, fridges, beds, you name it.

3140 2018-08-07 18:29:10 you cant ask that since you are big oil
3141 2018-08-07 18:28:56 Big oil companies are still drilling, coal companies are still digging, heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, volcanoes, earthquakes, storms etc etc etc just keep on intensifying.
Which is the dumbest species on the planet?
3142 2018-08-07 18:28:34 ISIS and "terrorism" is a creation by your government to destabilize oil producing regions for selfish gain...so basically they should delete themselves
3143 2018-08-07 18:28:33 "Don't like it? Start your own social media company!" is almost as ridiculous today as "Don't like it? Start your own oil refining company!" would've been in the 1880s.
3144 2018-08-07 18:28:05 Put your efforts into more important things you drunk. This issue shouldn't be as big as you made it. Smoke and mirrors you snake oil salesman.

3148 2018-08-07 18:27:36 I think it is reasonable to expect Oil patch to do what is best for their bottom line. If there is cheaper feed stock, they will take it 

Lot of money gambling on a really long pipeline that may not be used  (is tanker shipment is still cheaper than pipeline shipment?)
3149 2018-08-07 18:27:34 Lemme give you a life hack from my italian great great grandma. You have a stain? Dawn soap. Your oil company spills. Dawn soap. You spilt fruit punch all over your white shorts? Dawn soap. You eating chocolate ice cream and it happens to get over your new shirt? You guessed it.

3151 2018-08-07 18:27:28 Great, but no one nation has exclusivity over gold, oil, or other "vital" resources. Outside of cutting edge tech, it's really about resources and territory, hold the nail salons and pizza parlors.
3152 2018-08-07 18:27:20 What else can you expect from a snake-oil salesman? Oh! I forgot! It wasn't snake oil, was it??!!!

3155 2018-08-07 18:27:04 Probably because many First Nations have working brains and know we need petroleum products right now and also know that Canadian oil is obtained more responsibly than most other places.

3157 2018-08-07 18:26:56 I just love olive oil so much. 
3158 2018-08-07 18:26:50 Which makes the lesson clear: "We are a rich country, influential in global politics because of our oil and related wealth, and other countries dare not challenge us due to this outsize influence."

An abject lesson in how the UN functions; & the cowardly behavior of Europeans.
3159 2018-08-07 18:26:33 when bailey and i first started dating we were talking about skin care and he told me his “”””routine”””” was to once in a while rub coconut oil all over himself including his face and i just about DIED
3160 2018-08-07 18:26:21 If your business model is to sell snake oil and lies you shouldn’t have a public platform. Move onto another town.
3161 2018-08-07 18:26:18 Maybe , just mayBe. Kim  and Kourtney can resolve this matter in a big swimming pool filled with Jell-O and baby oil. And then sell the after mixture in Rachel Rays dog food.

the box was a Mecafilter
(Made in Morocco).

They are actually a renown brand, yet still didn't expect they'd replace Purflux in OE.

(I admit having a 'oil pressure anxiety' feeling for a sec ;-)
3165 2018-08-07 18:26:01 What was my generation's obsession with irony but an intellectual version of the larger world's environmental destruction? Extracting the short term juice of feeling clever, just like coal or oil, leaving the whole damned thing empty and ruined on any longer scale.
3166 2018-08-07 18:25:57 trumps not worried, hes getting all his oil from russia.
3167 2018-08-07 18:25:57 I make a chickpea salad—chickpeas+tomato+red onion+olive oil+lemon+garlic—and it’s so good, especially when tomatoes are great.
3168 2018-08-07 18:25:55 Saudi efforts to drive down oil prices have drastically reduced Venezuela’s state budget and led to enormous consequences for the Venezuelan economy."Before all that Venezuala was doing quote well.What is now happening is just another Chile and Argentina,like always with our help
3169 2018-08-07 18:25:52 It's all about the oil? Didn't Trump state in an interview we should take Iran's oil, or was it Iraq? I know the comment was made by him, just need to find it!

3173 2018-08-07 18:25:01 @UKCycleChat anyone got any good recommendations for getting chain oil out of my jerseys 
3174 2018-08-07 18:24:57 Scotgov rightly point out decisions hamstrung by lack of full budget control. Claim otherwise is gaslighting. £15 billion pa shortfall is pure unionist BS not backed by facts. Scotlands oil is undervalued (rig to ship transfers omitted etc). Wouldn't fund trident, HS2, etc = £'s
3175 2018-08-07 18:24:56 The Saudis had Idi Amin and despite his Crimes against humanity, USA could not intervene for fearing that Saudis will go back on their oil promise 
3176 2018-08-07 18:24:56 When the oil flows, it doesn't matter if one terrorist operates the pump, the US wants the oil, no matter how many and which people die for it. The US is not interested in freedom, democracy, religions, people, foreign politicians, only oil and dollars count.

3185 2018-08-07 18:23:31 Most don't want the oil. Republicans want oil. Democrats prefer renewable energy. Learn more about US politics. Natives don't care about the environment anymore? That's news.
3186 2018-08-07 18:23:29 Yeah right! Money makes the world go round and Saudis have a lot of money and let's not forget oil. Human rights are all great and everything until they don't interfere with profit. I think Yemen is a good example of that
3187 2018-08-07 18:23:27 This is why in a Trade war,China would lose.for Oil,I am sure China can divert oil from Iran cos China needs oil and gas to power it's industry but to go against Trump US and sell cars directly to Iran,trust me, even China won't help Iran on this.

3196 2018-08-07 18:22:43 It has helped both myself and my husband. CBD oil is a life saver

3208 2018-08-07 18:22:07 @cullyandsully Hi, Really love your tomato & basil soup.  Today, tried the Pea & Minty.  Husband said to tell you it tasted like Duckham's motor oil...which hasn't been on the market for years.  Binned it...per his instruction.  Maybe bad batch.
3209 2018-08-07 18:22:04 Why is CNN airing old episodes of Glenn Beck?
3210 2018-08-07 18:21:54 The future energy source of solar is reliant on regular sun. Corporations, which have been running the world since the 70s, are able to manifest global warming. Bankers have already locked in the profit margins for the energy revolution freeing nations from US dollar/oil matrix.
3211 2018-08-07 18:21:50 so when big corporations that have a monopoly in something like this case social media conspire (thats what it is) to get someone silenced that's something to be applauded? what would you think of monopoly OPEC raising price of oil to say $1000 per barrel one day?

3213 2018-08-07 18:21:40 I guess our candles aren't technically candles, they have swappable, oil burning cores, to save money on beeswax, I think.
3214 2018-08-07 18:21:36 "the alcohol or starch in the product soaks up the excess oil and grease in your hair, giving it a cleaner, fresher appearance"!
3215 2018-08-07 18:21:30 The recent news of oil in PAK Iran border with size upto more than Kuwait reserves is found to be fake
3216 2018-08-07 18:21:28 I'm going to blame sun and camera quality, except it's an android then lol. It's oil

3219 2018-08-07 18:21:02 So the big oil guys are investing in $TSLA ?
3220 2018-08-07 18:20:47 If you lose the oil i will turn your post notifications off
3221 2018-08-07 18:20:38 Come to England in May/June & I'll show you fields of golden yellow Winter followed by Spring Oil Seed Rape / Canola. The field margins will be alive with bees / bugs and all the higher wildlife depending on the OSR / Canola food chain. The same in all NW Europe.
3222 2018-08-07 18:20:37 Have to sell out to a foreign country because you couldn't do it.  Saudi will just pump it up then start to squash it. Saudi is an oil country, not an electric country. Oil will win.
3223 2018-08-07 18:20:36 Silly Season stuff (I hope).  Anyway the increased price of oil is pushing up the Tax take.
3224 2018-08-07 18:20:33 Took a bath in Thai lemongrass oil  It was definitely what I needed after that workout 
3225 2018-08-07 18:20:28 So Videoton changed their name to ‘FC Vidi’ due to sponsorship. 
A Hungarian oil company. Poor show. If it was for sponsorship they should have went with the natural next step, Netflixton FC.
3226 2018-08-07 18:20:21 China says all oil imports be paid  in cny which is now convertible to gold via Shanghai gold exchange.
Is that a basically a petro-gold backed yuan? If so, why isn't there any coverage of the petro-usd's new competitor? Will that cause a supply crunch in an already tight market?
3227 2018-08-07 18:20:21 Truffle oil on a bitch
3228 2018-08-07 18:20:16 Baby oil is essential
3229 2018-08-07 18:20:05 Here’s my natural curl routine:
Shampoo and condition. 
Put Moroccan oil in when still damp and comb through. 
Bedhead curl cream when still damp and comb through. 
Let air dry overnight and run bedhead after party in the next morning to combat frizz!
3230 2018-08-07 18:19:47 Socialism fails under harsh US sanctions and the worlds largest untapped oil reserves.
See Germany, Iceland, Scandanavia for Socialism.

3232 2018-08-07 18:19:44 Fuel cells also less than half as efficient as BEVs — requiring more than twice the solar panels (or oil) to go the same distance down the road.
3233 2018-08-07 18:19:43 You guys, peanut butter is delicious. Especially an old school Peter Pan treat. None of that oil separation you have to pretend isn't gross when you're 'stirring' it.

3235 2018-08-07 18:19:37 The price of oil is about to become unaffordable. Tesla to boom. Again. Someone sure likes your company.
3236 2018-08-07 18:19:37 In Atlantic Canada we welcome the idea of western oil being piped to us.
3237 2018-08-07 18:19:26 Efficascent Oil Extra Strength the famous liniment. Amazing. Powerful. Intense.
3238 2018-08-07 18:19:08 WWII, Look at Ford, JPMorgan, AT&T, IBM, Standard OIL, and many more American companies were profiting from the slave labor of the concentration camps. This is why American news papers were owned by the Rothschilds to control public opinion.
3239 2018-08-07 18:19:07 Suburbia changes people in strange ways. I just ordered fuel oil for the first time in my life.
3240 2018-08-07 18:19:06 What about the impact on the long run? And how would the sanctions impact foreign oil companies investing in Iran?
3241 2018-08-07 18:18:59 <みなさんにとっての"オイル"とは何ですか⁇
3242 2018-08-07 18:18:57 There are 2 questions my mechanic always asks me & which I never know the answer: What kind of oil do you use, regular or synthetic? How much did you pay for your last oil change?
What I want to answer is, fuck Jeff, update your billing system & we wouldn't have this conversation
3243 2018-08-07 18:18:55 Saudi Arabia is supposed to be an “ally” (because of its oil reserves and military bases). In truth, there has never been any human rights, gender equality or free speech. The repressive & wealthy elite sits on top of its people. Allowing the Saudis to push the West is foolish.
3244 2018-08-07 18:18:54 I can always get the oil out but some seasonings are tooo stubborn
3245 2018-08-07 18:18:51 Beware he will get his oil back
3246 2018-08-07 18:18:45 I read about this story and I’m sure she used cbd oil. Why doesn’t anything get said about it?
3247 2018-08-07 18:18:34 Stick it on a barbecue or roast it in such a way it becomes charred. Then blend with lemon, olive oil, seasoning, tahini - nice dip as alternative to hummus
3248 2018-08-07 18:18:28 Ohhhhh nice! I used tea tree oil (: you guys are beautiful 
3249 2018-08-07 18:18:27 Funny how American groups pay protestors to stop Canadian oil production and now we buy more oil from the US than anywhere else.. #cdnpoli
3250 2018-08-07 18:18:09 Most of this oil & gas commission mtg has been spent doing nothing of import. We’re now filling out the mtg calendar into 2019. Plus 5 @ncdeq employees here having their time wasted #ncpol @NCPolicyWatch
3251 2018-08-07 18:18:00 I was at least smart enough to realize that refined diesel doesn't just come out of the ground. I figured the oil was to become diesel later. ;)
3252 2018-08-07 18:17:56 Poor we Iranians who will be despoiled by ur trading partners even more. At least do a favor for us: ask them to extract oil themselves as its money will end up in their banks.
3253 2018-08-07 18:17:54 Kinder morgan was a fiasco long before those two came to power.  I think we can blame Montreal mayor for Energy East. Carbon tax.... ok.  But you can't blame them for the discounted oil.  That's all Harper and Alberta PC not pushing the pipeline to get to world markets
3254 2018-08-07 18:17:54 Exactly how I want it to be. I dont want an oil oligarch or yank billionaire paying our debts. Us, the fans, are the most important things in our club and we will pay off the debt ourselves. Makes us all important, unlike City or Chelsea where only 1 person matters.
3255 2018-08-07 18:17:50 Russia supplies oil to Iran, Iran will now have to pay MORE money to Russia and China, since that's who ISN'T sanctioning them. It's all about the dollar!

3258 2018-08-07 18:17:30 i massaged my body after I showered with this oil and omg... I’ve never felt/slept better. 
3259 2018-08-07 18:17:16 Thank the virgin oil Mary for this rant acc on my main I’m alike ‘everything’s fine111!!!2!2!!2’ and on here I’m getting all my FUCKs out hhhhh truly blessed
3260 2018-08-07 18:16:44 Reduce your heat to medium and let them cook longer.  Also take the potatoes out onto a plate, pour off the excess oil and return the potatoes to the pan.  Heat plus time (no matter how long) and you'll get crispy hash browns. Good Luck
3261 2018-08-07 18:16:39 *Dab pen. It's much more reasonable than an oil rig.
3262 2018-08-07 18:16:33 Is Big Recruiting like Big Oil or Big Pharma?
3263 2018-08-07 18:16:29 This shows a continuation of what the Obama admin had built. The massive glaring diff, that few are talking about, is that Obama did it without destroying protections that offer long term safety. Removing clean air to enable growth to an oil company isn't a positive achievement.
3264 2018-08-07 18:16:15 You act like Demorats dont do the EXACT same thing with the Saudis ... oil and money Trump all. If we got all our energy or at least all we could from our own soil would the Saudis even have any real pull ?
3265 2018-08-07 18:16:07 Getting my first oil change and I feel like a grown ass women
3266 2018-08-07 18:16:02 getting an oil change at team honda the wait is 2 hours , next time im sending my daddy
3267 2018-08-07 18:16:00 fixed my AC & got my oil changed, thank you babe  . 
3268 2018-08-07 18:15:55 Trump is undercutting Russia at every turn. Just one thing is, he is negotiating with Germany and the EU to get them to buy U.S. oil and natural gas instead of Russias. That is the only thing keeping the Russian economy afloat.
3269 2018-08-07 18:15:52 Do not put coconut oil on your face. It has one the heaviest fatty acid content. Which can clog your pores.
3270 2018-08-07 18:15:42 And dont sell oil to usa
3271 2018-08-07 18:15:37 Big oil or peace?
3272 2018-08-07 18:15:28 Need to strip the alfine hub out of Thunderbird 2 later as it needs to go back under warranty. It's refusing o freewheel or rotate backwards as its so "sticky" even after an oil change. Just chucks the chain off. The ride home was fun.
3273 2018-08-07 18:15:15 Not talking about the MIC or oil, talking about direct financial influence to control their governments via bank deals. The global banks don't control those governments yet
3274 2018-08-07 18:15:10 Is linden tea an omega 3 fish oil?
3275 2018-08-07 18:15:06 @CookOut Love your food (we frequentt your Richmond, KY store) but you serve everything in Styrofoam & so far as I can tell do no recycling other than cooking oil.  Please do better.

3277 2018-08-07 18:14:34 Can an engine that requires oil run smoothly without oil?

3279 2018-08-07 18:14:20 i bought two packages of oil paint but :( it’s not to my liking ... can’t return it to michaels i hate myself so so much
3280 2018-08-07 18:14:14 I do have training in Parasitology.  It is a lost science  and that is why people are so chronically ill now in the US. Other nations are much better at addressing this very common issue. Edometriosis is caused by Ascarids. Treatment: CoQ 10 , L-Cystiene and ozoneated Olive oil.
3281 2018-08-07 18:14:14 Damn castor oil can do anything wtf lol
3282 2018-08-07 18:13:46 I braided my hair a little more than a month ago, I based my scalp with coconut oil twice a week and that's all.
3283 2018-08-07 18:13:40 Partly explains why we have oil, can't imagine the ones they come across in South south region 
3284 2018-08-07 18:13:36 When you cook things in oil, they get hot, Juan!
3285 2018-08-07 18:13:24 Right because we're totally not concerned about people, including women and children, being blown up, murdered, raped, and who knows what else. It's all about the oil. 

Idiot.
3286 2018-08-07 18:13:23 What, if you spew hate and conspiracy to hawk snake oil YouTube drops you? Sounds like an excellent precedent to me. Also I like your Freudian spelling mistake, the president is in fact abhorrent
3287 2018-08-07 18:13:20 Natalie is a  tuner that likes Sesame oil on their sausage pizza with grape juice
3288 2018-08-07 18:13:14 $ISM.C is now an oil play lol
3289 2018-08-07 18:13:13 According to BP's Statistical Review of World Energy, global oil reserves at the end of 2012 were 1.7 trillion barrels. Given that the world consumes about 86 million barrels of crude oil per day, it would be easy to conclude we'll run out of oil in 55 years, or sooner
3290 2018-08-07 18:12:51 Guys look out for:
Lucky Johnathan Kiki Oops!!!  Too much Oil there!!!
 
3291 2018-08-07 18:12:43 OIL PASTEL DEMOS: Taking a few minutes to capture big scenes on small paper...
3292 2018-08-07 18:12:43 There are other oil producers, like ourselves!
3293 2018-08-07 18:12:39 To increase the price of producing goods in other countries by manipulating the price of oil.
It is conceivable that President Putin was informed in a one-to-one talk about it and
the old game; good and bad "policeman" should be taught to warlike conditions
to provoke.
3294 2018-08-07 18:12:37 well since shampoo is literally stripping the natural oils out of ur hair, maybe ur scalp produces more oil to overcompensate for the lack of?? same thing happens with oily skin 
3295 2018-08-07 18:12:35 castttor oil
3296 2018-08-07 18:12:25 Refinery would be quite Optimum, but no government wants to touch with a ten-foot pole, since the market has failed to build a new one in Alberta. You are correct about Irving Oil, it's a private business and no guarantees, but I think it's reasonable to expect them to buy IMO
3297 2018-08-07 18:12:07 You go to department store & remember only a two or three brands of soap biscuit toothpaste oil etc
You go to cast vote.everything is blacked out you  remember just few candidates.Why

3298 2018-08-07 18:12:03 Guyssss my car has AC now and an oil change and a full tank of gas AND a car washhh wooooo
3299 2018-08-07 18:12:02 Holy shit. Daytime TV is scary. Sitting here waiting for my oil change and I’ve seen The Real and now Harry. Older man on the other side of the room looked at me in dismay. It’s truly been a tragic lineup.
3300 2018-08-07 18:11:56 Psst.. Saudi Arabi is backing off selling oil. We produce more lng and oil now.. Russias entire economy depends on Energy sales. Iran is Russias ally and business parter... Pay ATTENTION. and try not to be angry without proper research...
3301 2018-08-07 18:11:53 Lots of info in your graph Peter. 

1) Is the North Sea in unstoppable prodn decline? Will they b able to stop the declines?

2) How sustainable is US Tight Shale Oil prodn? David Hughes analysis says less than a decade b4 steep declines.
3302 2018-08-07 18:11:51 I hate when I oil my scalp then the oil just starts sliding down my forehead 
3303 2018-08-07 18:11:46 Yes, the massive amounts or royalties pd to governments by oil and gas companies are missed by most of these economists. In AB, if what you call "subsidies" were reduced, dollar for dollar, with royalty reductions wld u then be happy? No, didn't think so.
3304 2018-08-07 18:11:45 เอออนั่นดิ บางทีก็ดูสูสี 5555555555
3305 2018-08-07 18:11:33 I remember 2013-2104 too. And trading right now is below the 2010 avg. While I have no doubt that the sanctions are and will continue to affect gas and oil prices, we’ve seen the volatility since 2008 and Iran hardly needs an excuse to cause trouble.
3306 2018-08-07 18:11:17 I don't have a car, so that actually doesn't bother me personally. And we get most of our crude oil from Norway. So...
3307 2018-08-07 18:11:13 I’m tired of spending money but I’m glad I already bought my oil last month 
3308 2018-08-07 18:11:06 The U.S. has massive oil reserves available via deep sea drilling in the Gulf, a better alternative to fracking and would create a lot of jobs in both operations and engineering. It requires around $65/barrels to break even.
3309 2018-08-07 18:11:05 Are u sure it isn't because the oil is going to be sold in the petro Yuan contract instead of US manipulated confetti?
3310 2018-08-07 18:11:00 6. local governments - welfare to corporate welfare queen parasites - Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Comcast, Nestle, Pepsi, Coca Cola, banks, oil, coal, prescription drugs, electricity, large food companies, large farming companies, etc
3311 2018-08-07 18:10:57 Let’s use all those materials in the building of trump hotels! Oh yeah...he doesn’t care about his guests. Ok..use the materials for his personal residence. This is like the the oil rigs off of Florida. Ok for the rest of you!

3313 2018-08-07 18:10:45 Black castor oil or Argan oil (available from @Afri_berry although it's tough to access their products)
3314 2018-08-07 18:10:43 Desperate attempt

Everybody should be aware that they are the intension behind sanctions against Iran,
that the US president wants to push up the price of oil in order to give the US companies the advantage gain.
3315 2018-08-07 18:10:41 My baby need a oil change
3316 2018-08-07 18:10:39 Or would that be the same John Kavanagh that predicted a 4th round stoppage of nate Diaz at ufc 202.. don’t get your palms read by this snake oil salesman
3317 2018-08-07 18:10:34 I’ve been working out here since 2014. Have learned more while driving my truck and listening to various podcasts since then than in the 20 years prior. I discovered Metaxas and Zmirak thanks to the oil patch. #winningatlife
3318 2018-08-07 18:10:34 I put too much oil in the pan and didn’t let it get hot enough and added the hash browns too soon and now they won’t crisp up and my day is ruined.
3319 2018-08-07 18:10:29 Add 2 part fertiliser and one part oil, oh wait that’s a different recipe.
3320 2018-08-07 18:10:25 dont forget Italy Government is most Corupted Regime in Europe And They Need Afghanistan Narcotic Via Iran Thats Why They Need Ayatolah For Narcotic and Cheap OIL iron ,Coper,Gold ,Oil ,Gas and Cheapest Labor in the World Iranian Worker For 89 Dollars a Month
3321 2018-08-07 18:10:24 My light just popped on for an oil change 
3322 2018-08-07 18:10:23 I agree. 

If Canada really wants the world to buy Canadian oil (vs oil from the Middle East), we should set an example by using our own oil for internal needs.
3323 2018-08-07 18:10:22 すっかりバルカロールも寒くなったなー。へくしっ
3324 2018-08-07 18:10:18 y’all castor oil really lives up to the hype my hair has been growing so fast 
3325 2018-08-07 18:10:15 Sun means bald head burns, bugs, sweat, oil, glasses getting sweat and oil on them, feeling uncomfortably hot, feeling itchy from grass and the bugs and the sweat, smelling, annoying sun block, and feeling envious of everyone else's gym bodies

3331 2018-08-07 18:09:52 So I experimented with not using my Chicken marinades for a month or so,  replaced it with red wine vinegar and a teaspoon of Olive Oil,  the weight fell off me doing a similar workout I have been doing

3334 2018-08-07 18:09:36 Yeah since he has a lot of media against him because well, it’s the future and electric and media most likely ran by ppl who love oil. It would be better to be private.
3335 2018-08-07 18:09:35 You lay for Saudi Arabia . The attacked was not oil ship it was warship.
3336 2018-08-07 18:09:34 I think the Romans had the right idea. First, fill pores up with oil and let it soak. Then, go in a hot tub or the steam, and then, after a while, scrape off all that oil and put on some clay and let THAT soak. And then, wash with the soaps.
3337 2018-08-07 18:09:27 Finally got some shit done, i got new tires for my car, oil change, and new big ass suit case... i needed that.
3338 2018-08-07 18:09:25 True.  Seem like a hedge against their own oil revenue.  Just a strange new
3339 2018-08-07 18:09:09 You could have condensed that in my opinion. I don’t know why but oil get fired up if they keep moaning about us. We’re above them and normal service has been resumed. It’s not ideal is it...
3340 2018-08-07 18:08:58 The lady deserves a knighthood  there’s not a country outside of the brokern  eu that would tolerate the child paedophiles and protect them maybe the Saudis won’t sell us oil if we do anything about it why do the government not do anything
3341 2018-08-07 18:08:53 :)  My Mom, as well & an inveterate collector!  I have most of her creations (oil paintings & pottery) as well as an incredible amount of 'collectibles' :)
3342 2018-08-07 18:08:47 No, Canada should sever all ties with them...Saudi Arabia has a disgraceful human rights record and we  NEED ethical Canadian oil, not Sharia oil #Canada #BoycottOPEC @aboutpipelines @OilGasCanada
3343 2018-08-07 18:08:45 Babes will rub oil on their faces and start tweeting “gloww”.

Like what else was supposed to happen? 
3344 2018-08-07 18:08:18 That is because you don't know the eternal difference,  the difference is the OIL... So the honour is not to the man on the pulpit it is to HE that called him (GOD).
3345 2018-08-07 18:08:12 Not much of hedge as their oil is worth trillion dollars
3346 2018-08-07 18:08:08 They're mining for a rich seam of Etonian talent. But actually its a crystallised lump of snake oil.

3350 2018-08-07 18:07:29 @SkyAngkorAir you guys forgot to refill oil until passengers have boarded. we are now on shuttle bus watching refilling.
3351 2018-08-07 18:07:13 Keep digging. There's oil down there somewhere.
3352 2018-08-07 18:06:53 Which day is the least busiest to get an oil change?
3353 2018-08-07 18:06:46 Those who IGNORANTLY disrespectfully comment on our national game..I doubt if you Have got the guts to oil wrestle???Kind of SUMO Wrestling...Whats wrong with it....Guess u appreciate Mud wrestling..which I myself find disgusting!!!!,at which ,on the other hand, u may be drooling
3354 2018-08-07 18:06:45 But we can get oil from Saudi Arabia
3355 2018-08-07 18:06:42 For full LCA we need more transparency on assays for California oil. Oil fields evolve over time, and things have changed a lot since the last detailed assay came out for Midway sunset in the late 1970s. One thing CA could do is to require release of assays for oil sold in CA.
3356 2018-08-07 18:06:37 Toothpaste. Doesn’t matter what kind. Gently smear over affected area. Let dry. Remove with warm water and soap. Preferably Oil of Olay or Dove. Repeat day and night. You should be glowing mamas!!!
3357 2018-08-07 18:06:34 It'll be a gift my friend to pay you back for the almond oil and all the wild stories of camels, odd Mass experiences, and crazy things you've entertained me with this last little while as you've survived being Canadian in the Middle East.
3358 2018-08-07 18:06:22 We should not only be  using less oil but find morealternatives to it
3359 2018-08-07 18:06:18 Whale
Oil
Beef
Hooked!
3360 2018-08-07 18:06:03 peppermint oil
3361 2018-08-07 18:05:59 Saudi Arabia has not decided to stop shipping oil to Canada.
3362 2018-08-07 18:05:53 You are the other half (?) 

Sesame oil + Eric Mun = Shin Hyesung
3363 2018-08-07 18:05:53 Oh, I the Mighty! I loved Connector and the re-worked album, Oil in Water.

Side note, A+ to your music taste, it’s very similar to my own.
3364 2018-08-07 18:05:50 Cow sey na beef. Beef sey na APC & PDP. PDP sey na Osinbajo. VP sey na DSS. DSS sey na order. Order sey na Oil. Oil sey na AkwaIbom. Akwaibom sey na Akpabio. Akpabio sey na Senate. Senate sey na witch-hunt. Witch-hunt sey na Wike. Wike sey na Amaechi. Amaechi sey na Wike.
3365 2018-08-07 18:05:46 No new dm signing in this window... 
Maybe our Sugar Daddy is bored & wants a new fluffer girl? 
Maybe the oil money has dried up? 
Maybe players don't want to play for a little club like Citeh? 
Maybe Txiki is a fraud? 

Or maybe our squad is strong enough.  Have faith. #MCFC
3366 2018-08-07 18:05:39 So u mean u guys never new of the barricade.... O wrong oil
3367 2018-08-07 18:05:30 That's what. Real life is about other things than power dynamics. Oppression and abuse are caused by power dynamics. Canada has enough oil not to need the 11% coming from SA. A government should be at the service of the citizens, not the citizens at the service of the government.
3368 2018-08-07 18:05:27 Please - if it comes down to that, Canada has far more oil than Saudi Arabia which, unlike Canada, has absolutely nothing more to offer. SA should apologize profusely, release Badawi, stop exporting violent Wahabiism around the world, and stop threatening terrrorist attacks.
3369 2018-08-07 18:05:13 RT @LivingSafely: Eating mayonnaise this August? It's made by adding oil to egg yolks. Commercial mayo can be as much as 80% fat!
3370 2018-08-07 18:05:12 Yea Saudi govts investment profile has changed recently. Used to be more conservative. Looking to hedge oil I guess.
3371 2018-08-07 18:05:10 We need full LCA for oil with carbon capture. The emissions impacts will vary by oil, and it still makes sense to start with CCS for lower emitting oils first. Production of heavy oils need to be shut down as CCS ramps up for lower emitting oils.
3372 2018-08-07 18:04:56 It's the amount of money the Saudis spend in UK that trumps the human rights issues. The Saudis would be a backwater medieval cesspool of humanity if oil wasn't found there now it's just a backwater medieval cesspool of humanity with money.
3373 2018-08-07 18:04:50 A well-known multinational oil and gas firm in the United States ‘Exxon Mobil’ is on the point of exploring huge oil reserves near the Pakistan-Iran border, which could reportedly be bigger than the Kuwaiti reserves.

3374 2018-08-07 18:04:37 Welcome to Florida, Moroccan Argan oil is my best friend. And I make sure my hair is completely dry before stepping outside. 
3375 2018-08-07 18:04:36 After Seeing what Qatar and Saudi Arabia are doing with their oil money, I wonder if Nigeria is selling coconut oil
3376 2018-08-07 18:04:36 Chumps.  I guess when you have two much money, losing a lot of it does not concern you.  It's hard to see Tesla as a natural hedge for decreasing demand for oil.  Much bigger upside in solar and wind.
3377 2018-08-07 18:04:32 My doctor would still be prescribing it if I hadn’t told them I was taking zero THC CBD oil. He cut me off for that
3378 2018-08-07 18:04:19 The $TSLAQ bears are quiet.  If I were them I'd be try to spin big Saudi money invested in $TSLA as a kiss of death or some sort of green mission funding by dirty oil money.  @skabooshka @TeslaCharts @brodieferguson Thoughts?
3379 2018-08-07 18:04:09 I did not have such a morning, as my only struggle was trying to flip an egg without getting burned by the cooking oil, and proceeded to flip it with the help of a football helmet and a cardboard shield
3380 2018-08-07 18:04:09 Dr. Barker, Thank you, Sir, for this word. My feet, ankles & legs in great pain so I can't sleep at night. A pastor is praying for me, anointing my head w/oil twice a week. Believing to be healed NOW in the Name of Jesus! Thank you for your prayers, Sir! I appreciate you!
3381 2018-08-07 18:04:00 Ever since I started trying @commiegirl1's system of washing with olive oil before soap, the pores are much less fighting with the immune system! Praise Editrix, Boss of Us All!
3382 2018-08-07 18:03:47 So, is Jeff Goldblum so woke that he seems high 24 hours a day, or is he actually just dropping LSD, vaping some THC oil, and popping some ecstasy before every public appearance?
3383 2018-08-07 18:03:46 Hahaha we have our own oil  we dont need nor want your dirty shit
3384 2018-08-07 18:03:45 Tips from my lifestyle brand: Drop a bottle of sesame oil in your kitchen a week ago and your apartment will smell like sesame no matter how much you clean
3385 2018-08-07 18:03:37 @contrarianEPS @yesvamsi He is born for creating panic with oil cartel.. now oil cartels are giving him an offer which he can’t refuse...he is engineer he is facing pressure from markets.. to perform every quarter. He made his options open he would have got the offer..
3386 2018-08-07 18:03:36 Snorting 10 spoons of hemp oil + eating almonds 93 times a day cures cancer. (source: Facebook)
Now please focus on teleportation pods/pads/beams.
3387 2018-08-07 18:03:27 We got oil forever dude we dont care how much we sell it as soon we get their army around our countries and protect us like the way we want dummy ;) we the kings
3388 2018-08-07 18:03:23 We’re working non-stop now to get your HATEful and HATE-fueled lies off of Twitter.  

You can spew all you want in the wind, but you aren’t entitled to use a privately-owned platform to sell your snake oil to the vulnerable.
3389 2018-08-07 18:03:19 Oil changes synthetic and regular for low hmu
3390 2018-08-07 18:03:12 Here is the thing my left wing friends. IF @JustinTrudeau and @cafreeland had a consistence alliance with nations that don’t meet our high moral road. I would respect the grandstanding. But they don’t. We sell weapons of war to the Saudis and buy their oil. Actions > Words
3391 2018-08-07 18:03:11 PLEASE do not bring this garbage up!!!! How about listing all of the environmental toxins being placed back into our country:  asbestos, mfg. run off, FLINT, Puerto Rico, oil rigs on protected lands, car emissions....  This costs lives & $$$.  
3392 2018-08-07 18:03:11 Some sort of homemade weight gainer. Probably oil, nut butters and grains added to the whey.
3393 2018-08-07 18:02:42 Even if Tesla goes private you will still have oil companies and their PR firms bashing electric vehicles and Tesla by extension?
3394 2018-08-07 18:02:39 I think ignoring is too nice a word for Ignoramus Trump. He doesn't care. Thinks he's immune to weather disaster. Thinks if he refuses to face the pending disaster it won't matter as much as his corporate gas/oil/coal buddies making money does. Corrupt. Debauched. Dead inside.
3395 2018-08-07 18:02:26 Bull. He's been agaisnt OPEC for decades and has put US back in the oil industry. With all the other presidents it was about oil.
3396 2018-08-07 18:02:10 United currently has 23 'global' sponsorship partners, from Gulf Oil as 'official lubricant partner' to Casillero del Diablo (official wine). There's also a noodle partner, according to The Times.
3397 2018-08-07 18:01:59 Remember that truly unhinged time when everyone was using coconut oil for everything
3398 2018-08-07 18:01:56 100$ oil change should be illegal
3399 2018-08-07 18:01:56 Had to give my cat a bath he hated it, I let him out last night he came back covered in some kind of oil, poor little dude. :(
3400 2018-08-07 18:01:55 Get you one that rub lavender oil on ya before you go to bed 
3401 2018-08-07 18:01:45 Finally, what if you asked the question: Should California allow oil drilling next door to schools and hospitals? You acknowledge the issue of local impacts, but don't consider a policy that restricts supply based, at least in part, on those impacts.
3402 2018-08-07 18:01:42 #oott the impact of iranian oil sanctions under trump will be very different to iranian oil sanction under Obama ...  then you multiply that by the china tarrifs ..
3403 2018-08-07 18:01:41 Turkey doesn’t have oil nor natural gas. We import them. Out growth comes from production.
3404 2018-08-07 18:01:20 Lol 
Try changing the engine oil
3405 2018-08-07 18:01:18 Yeah, as lawfully held as those right wing undemocratic criminals could ever dream to be. Now they are getting into bed with the extreme right of the USA, racists, anti-civil rights, anti freedom of expression, pro oil wars and pro civil violence. I'd rather be a knucklehead.
3406 2018-08-07 18:01:15 Trying to save time & money for your business in the oil industry? #RFID is making traction in the #oilindustry for valve tracking.

3413 2018-08-07 18:00:48 I hear the US has lots. Or they can eat oil. After the 911 picture of the CN tower they can go straight to hell.
3414 2018-08-07 18:00:36 Canada's oil tar sands are an abusive disgrace to the planet. The country is no green angel and golden boy Trudeau is in league with big oil.

3418 2018-08-07 18:00:11 This. He’s been using YT & FB as hosts for his videos using terabyte upon terabyte of their storage and bandwidth free of charge, embedding them on his sites. Now he’ll have to actually use some of the millions he’s made pedaling snake oil supplements to host them himself.
3419 2018-08-07 18:00:02 Easy. Jagjit supports Saudi Arabia more than Canadian oil interests

3421 2018-08-07 18:00:01 My parents stole my leftover pizza from the fridge, jokes on them bc it had chillies and chili oil on it and I'm the only one who likes spicy food

3423 2018-08-07 17:59:59 Yes i drink motor oil! If you down w fish n grits and all the pimp shit lemme hear you say oh yeah!
3424 2018-08-07 17:59:55 Little jealous of the women who don't have stretch marks. No amount of oil and lotion is stopping mine. 
3425 2018-08-07 17:59:54 Why not? their oil is much cheaper.
3426 2018-08-07 17:59:51 Gayest man on earth would call oil wrestling over the top
3427 2018-08-07 17:59:45 Looks like I’m gonna be stuck at Pep Boys while they do my oil change.
3428 2018-08-07 17:59:29 Woke up at 4:45. Did my #workout, ate breakfast, & now sitting at the dealership waiting for my husband's oil change.
It's only 8. Going to be a long day.
3429 2018-08-07 17:59:25 It's great news! It means that the oil industry is now helping to fund its replacement.
3430 2018-08-07 17:59:24 I am making the simple point that the very existence of Saudi surplus, where ever in the world it was deposited or invested, made that money available to all global uses, including Freddie Mac. The oil shock was redistribution from global consumers of oil to global investors
3431 2018-08-07 17:59:22 What if you asked the question: Should California produce oil that is as dirty as tar sands? You don't analyze a case where California phases out production of its dirtiest oil supplies.
3432 2018-08-07 17:59:21 What you mean is that the people getting rich off the process like us to believe it's 'widely recognised' that its nawty animals rather than soy oil driving deforestation.
3433 2018-08-07 17:59:03 I'm discussing what a silly Minister of Climate Change we have.  She makes jingo statements that have nothing behind them.  Of course, emissions (irrelevant to climate change) go up with increased economic activity.  We use oil a lot and rightly so.
3434 2018-08-07 17:59:02 “Hey Brooke I have bad news, apparently tee tree oil is toxic to cats.” “Well that is bad news...I guess we don’t have cats anymore”
3435 2018-08-07 17:58:57 olive oil the best perm 
3436 2018-08-07 17:58:49 Your environmental policies are the reason we are getting the fires. Don't fuck with our trees; stop allowing coal and oil and car companies to pollute our atmosphere with so much carbon that temperatures are record highs and rainfalls are record lows.
3437 2018-08-07 17:58:44 Man City fans act as if they supported the club before the oil moneyffs
3438 2018-08-07 17:58:44 We also need to uphold US treaties with Native American tribes especially when they take a stand against Big Oil to protect water resources.

#NoDAPL
3439 2018-08-07 17:58:28 "almost become" - ;) - I'm sure manufacturers are keen to keep the price of the oil low, given it plays such a big part in making their business economical.
3440 2018-08-07 17:58:13 Kirby and his brave band of nine followers. I will personally see you Scots get nothing says brave Kirby. We will man the border and make sure you don’t have any wind to grow on your wind farms. No oil for your chips, we are the masters of the universe.
3441 2018-08-07 17:58:04  gotta get that castor oil lol
3442 2018-08-07 17:58:03 Good thing I'm not deathly allergic to peanuts. Last thing I was expecting in the ingredients list on a bag of potato chips was peanut oil. Only discovered it after eating half the bag. #annoyed
3443 2018-08-07 17:58:01 Let joce take my car today so i can take hers to get an oil change & now she thinks she’s reaaaally cool “  “ byeeeeee lol
3444 2018-08-07 17:57:34 Through shady means) and the policy of spending their money in stupid crap over the Chavez's years instead of modernizing their oil infraestructure, social welfare alone isn't the problem (you know gulf kingdoms have had an even more patronising welfare policy over decades).
3445 2018-08-07 17:57:32 This would be an excellent point were we talking about oil refinery...Einstein.
3446 2018-08-07 17:57:32 Since I have only coconut oil for now I applied it. Next time I'll buy the almond oil and try it
3447 2018-08-07 17:57:29 Well I think he believes too much in environmentalism and electric cars to risk letting a big oil producer like S-A buy and take Teslas off the streets. I think I stand by my conspiracy theory for now.
3448 2018-08-07 17:57:25 What if you asked the question: "Should California subsidize oil consumption in the rest of the world?" I think you would say no, but that is the effect of reducing oil demand without making corresponding cuts to supply.
3449 2018-08-07 17:57:12 If you have questions about CBD oil feel free to direct message me or just ask right here. :-) Have a great Tuesday!
3450 2018-08-07 17:57:11 HHS Secretary talking about Short Term Ins Policy which is a joke. You can't get short term ins with pre-ex dx. You pay thru the nose, then you get sick on the STP, you will get dropped by STP for being sick when the next payment is due. Gov't is selling snake oil not solutions
3451 2018-08-07 17:57:09 Somebody needs to give me a instruction sheet of how to act when I get my oil changed because every time I turn into *that girl*
3452 2018-08-07 17:57:08 Totally agree that knee jerk cuts harm Alberta significantly.   The Alberta (tax) Advantage ends up not sustainable in long term. Moderate Alberta based growth is better than adding tax avoiders to our population that’s gotten used to “free ride” on oil royalties.

3454 2018-08-07 17:57:03 Approve strong measures against Global Warming first!

Then we can talk border security.

Without life on earth no one will be talking about shit, let alone a border wall and border security you money hungry, oil peddling jack hole.
3455 2018-08-07 17:57:01 I like the way they look when they're mature? Like, that sort of iridescent covered-in-oil look and the white spots make them look like an inverted ermine tail coat royalty would wear. But god they are annoying to hear.
3456 2018-08-07 17:56:53 Farrell FLOURNOY @FLOURNOYFarrell As stated by IAEA inspectors, IRAN has been compliant; so why are sanctions being imposed? The reasons are WAR & because SAUDI ARABIA doesn't IRAN to sell oil on the world market. Saudi can limit supplies & increase oil prices based on shortage.
3457 2018-08-07 17:56:51 #ClayItAway!

Say goodbye to rough skin with Red Algae  Tackle excess oil by using Green Eucalyptus  
Buy your @lorealmakeup new clay washes from #Aqua!
3458 2018-08-07 17:56:46 Also, vitamin deficiencies can cause soreness. Check your diet. Another thing that works for me is to take flaxseed or fish oil.  Doesn't work for everyone but does for me.  The thought of quitting coffee to me seems unnecessary as it has so many health benefits.
3459 2018-08-07 17:56:42 You want Iran paralysed because they threaten American and Russian oil. You said on yr date with Putin that u will join together and supply oil as one. That’s how you plan to take over the word. Except we won’t let you!!! #TraitorInChief
3460 2018-08-07 17:56:33 hmm...from what I can extrapolate from the information that I have come across about the individual in question, is that he 'coincidently' turned up at the early stage of our beloved nabi's nabuwwah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam), kind of like a slithery oil salesman
3461 2018-08-07 17:56:29 Doesn’t matter much oil will be depleted in 50 years ... start planing ahead Canada
3462 2018-08-07 17:56:17 No money.. No oil anymore
You didn't see anything yat
3463 2018-08-07 17:56:13 Agreed & that is credit 2  success of Capitalism model that allowed enough Government liquidity  2 manage crisis-unlike VEN whose economy already in tatters but were fortunate to have oil 2 bolster themselves but instead of building diversity they undermined it with nationalising
3464 2018-08-07 17:56:09 Took my car in for an oil change and now they tryna tell me about all the shit I need done got me all scared like bro I JUST WANT AN OIL CHANGE

3468 2018-08-07 17:55:40 It's actually @RonWyden, you deranged dingbat. And as an actual constiuent, I can say I am proud and happy to be represented by him. He isn't a puppet to big oil, pharma or the NRA. He works for the people.
3469 2018-08-07 17:55:39 Lynne here’s yet another example of your analysis falling short. You are concerned about TMX and all of Twitter is concerned about energy east and what it could mean about getting off dictator oil. Give your head a shake
3470 2018-08-07 17:55:37 I'd suggest doing the small maintanence regularly as the drive line on bikes is one of the most expensive components on it besides the frame. I just use and old rag and a bucket of dishwash as it's degreaser lol and some light oil like sewing machine oil or CRC to lube it again.
3471 2018-08-07 17:55:34 When will Nigeria stop importing Petrol?

This is sad...

We export crude oil and import petroleum. Shame on us as a nation...
3472 2018-08-07 17:55:31 Did you use the same type of oil that was in it?
3473 2018-08-07 17:55:29 It's been 1,000 days since the BP oil spill and the Gulf of Mexico still has not been restored.
3474 2018-08-07 17:55:28 The sooner @KaizerChiefs starts preparing the future without Parker and/or Katsande the better. These guys are steadily running out of oil. #Khosi4Life #HailTheChief

3479 2018-08-07 17:55:04 Yeah we can buy back our discounted oil from the USA for full price. Great deal. Can we just build Energy East instead?
3480 2018-08-07 17:54:50 Cancel the oil purchases. Let Quebec go "carbon free"!
3481 2018-08-07 17:54:44 owns is sun, heat, sand and saltwater.
I mean that's great for production of energy and solar energy machinery. Are there any efforts? From where do you get the knowledge? Is those segment living or did you still stick on oil?
3482 2018-08-07 17:54:44 Start off with our Rosehip oil (use as your daily facial moisturizer accompanied by SPF, at all times)
3483 2018-08-07 17:54:42 All she does is sell body oil, shea butter & braid hair. She working like a slave niece lol.
3484 2018-08-07 17:54:40 10mm. The door has a slight texture on the panels, add that oil base levels better than water base and it was job done. I’d happily use the 5mm on flat panels without laying off if I’m using oil. You have to judge for yourself because not all paints are made equal.
3485 2018-08-07 17:54:35 Howard Hughes was pretty brilliant.  As I recall, he made his fortune producing a drill bit for oil exploration.  No biggie, right?  He got fee, a % of the oil $.  Without taking the risk of hitting sand.
3486 2018-08-07 17:54:34 Trudeau-Butts and the environment wackos are out to destroy our oil and gas industry. No ther country in the world is so self destructive.
3487 2018-08-07 17:54:30 The only reason why you guys are friends because you guys have oil 
3488 2018-08-07 17:54:25 This is just the beginning of the US oil production downgrades. Paper barrels don’t move through paper pipelines. #OOTT

3491 2018-08-07 17:54:10 Yeah oil & tires
3492 2018-08-07 17:54:08 Stop this kind of news.. you guys pouring oil while burning..
3493 2018-08-07 17:54:07 Heard huge oil reserves found in Pakistan, is that true?
3494 2018-08-07 17:53:55 I was working today and just nursing Happened to mention the name of the thing that finally took her all profsssional. I then spend 30 minutes sobbing like a three year old with colleagues comforting me. 18 months xx I wear oil of Olay and smell her jewellery. Weird?

3498 2018-08-07 17:53:23 @adeel_azhar  There is a fake news on air about Oil Reserves in Pakistan which is more than Kuwait. Its 100% wrong statement bcoz the Company EXXON is even not present in Pakistan. Can u pls clarify this in ur show and thru Twitter.
3499 2018-08-07 17:53:22 Woah, hacks who listen to snake oil salesman and performance artist Alex, fear something? Isn't that the whole point, constantly being fearful and duped.
3500 2018-08-07 17:53:17 a waste product created by deforestation when, ironically, pigs and chickens are a forest species ;) if humans want oil from a forest, they already had lard.
3501 2018-08-07 17:53:16 Anointing oil is olive oil mbok ... It's used for cooking
3502 2018-08-07 17:53:14 Yeah, they can fuck right off.

Vested interests in oil & gas will take down entire economies, if nation states don’t divest from stranded assets.
We’re already too bloody close to the line where sunset industries can rip the guts out of the global economy.
Next GFC in action.
3503 2018-08-07 17:53:08 The Norway government OWNS its biggest oil company and to your...uhm..brilliant mind that doesn't count as 'socialist'? Who am I to disagree with an all-knowing polymath.
3504 2018-08-07 17:52:59 I think I found something good enough for what I need. I played around in the texture box for the Pastel Rough, Oil Pastel and Carbonara brushes until they seem to do the trick. Setting them to "Dissolve" gives them some extra tooth. Thanks so much, Kyle!

3506 2018-08-07 17:52:52 Going rates vary, hash oil retails for around $50 per gram in Seattle, with wholesale rates of $20 to $30 per gram. The pound rate—if it exists—would be $9,000 wholesale or more. If one could source 72 ounces of liquid hash oil, it would carry a $40,000 price tag.
3507 2018-08-07 17:52:50 Did the government prematurely start oil transportation from Turkana? Share your thought and opinion with using the Hashtag #WastedResources @tonytimase @missmorganke
3508 2018-08-07 17:52:43 So is there any explanation for the Player Character Behavior in GONE HOME? Like, is Kaitlin ripping everything off the shelves because she's panicking, because she hates her parents, because she's looking for whale oil?
3509 2018-08-07 17:52:40 Bubbling Islamist insurgencies are popping up in the strangest places; now Africa has a reason to be invaded by Western powers. Islamic terrorists seem to be in strategic oil and mineral locations, or in the case of the Congo, biowarfare from a lethal strain of the Ebola virus.

3511 2018-08-07 17:52:20 If Reham Khan stoops any lower she will discover oil reserves.
3512 2018-08-07 17:51:51 unfortunately... we also need a refinery to promise to purchase this oil delivered by pipeline..  The Irving family is non-committal on any purchase agreement exclusive to Canada oil
3513 2018-08-07 17:51:50 Look at this cattle his country is feeding trumps pocket , as long as you have milk(oil’s money) trump is on your side and later he will slaughter you all coward cattle
3514 2018-08-07 17:51:46 Jim Womack: “there have been attempts to complain to the oil & gas commission. There will be more.” Does he plan to write new complaints from drillers as he allegedly did earlier this year? @NCPolicyWatch #ncpol

3516 2018-08-07 17:51:41 Hey, @uefa how much oil money is actually needed to act like tonights ref team in Malmö?
3517 2018-08-07 17:51:30 Mine came with a free oil change and car wash so who’s the real winner here
3518 2018-08-07 17:51:28 Elon owns 20% of the company, and I doubt he would give up a controlling interest. *IF* the Saudis are the big money behind this, it might signal a hedging move against the reality of the end of oil dominance. Also, Musk does have other rich friends in SV.
3519 2018-08-07 17:51:27 When you lose money on it, it becomes a “race to the bottom”.  Good beer costs money. Crappy beer is cheap. To whomever suggested it’s like oil... we don’t drink oil. Quality costs more. It’s a fact of life. #craftbeer #onpoli @NepeanGreens @NepeanRiding @OntarioGreens

3522 2018-08-07 17:51:06 สบายใจสะดวกแบบไหนก็เอาเลย โอเค!!!
3523 2018-08-07 17:51:04 If it is the Saudi’s they probably want to close it down to eliminate competition to oil. 
3524 2018-08-07 17:50:52 I combo between a face oil a face primer, and a mist to keep it moist. Helps even fine lines. Application of makeup are gentle packing & good blending brush.

3526 2018-08-07 17:50:41 EnergyEast is to export oil from the Irving refinery in Saint-John to the USA. Pipelines already go to Toronto and Montreal. Also, heavy oil is easier to refine when mixed with lite oil.
3527 2018-08-07 17:50:36 Never leave home without these two Summer favorites!!!
Rescue and Renew Gelee: great for sore muscles and sunburn.
Rescue and renew detox oil: All Natural Bug Repellent! Smells Devine!
I keep them in my beach bag!!
3528 2018-08-07 17:50:21 Will all imports and exports with China be stopped when China buys Iranian oil? Inquiring minds want to know.
3529 2018-08-07 17:50:12 With GOM oil trending down this year it looks like nearly every forecast is too high.  GOM is offsetting both TX and ND.
3530 2018-08-07 17:50:06 #calgary2026 #yescalgary2026 All the nostalgia for #yyc88 is just like an episode of #SouthPark where everyone gets addicted to #memberberries & ignores changed situation factors: (1) Low Shut In Oil (2)Inflated Security (3)City over extended already high taxes / utilities.
3531 2018-08-07 17:50:00 Because the workers at @Walmart decided to bullshit my oil change & not put oil in my car my engine has blown while I was on the freeway & my daughter was in the backseat I need answers ASAP on why I paid for an oil change I did not receive
3532 2018-08-07 17:49:59 Canada has a lot of oil
3533 2018-08-07 17:49:44 Unfortunately oil and water can never mix!
3534 2018-08-07 17:49:37 ...for a while to see if I get used to it, or just go back to my other iron, which is also good.

I was wanting to try liquid iron by it might be absorbed more readily.

It's worth mentioning that I had some symptoms of this or that when starting omega-three oil, but they

3536 2018-08-07 17:49:23 Waited to long to get my oil change & my filter thingy was all torn with rocks & bugs all stuck in it & the mechanic just stared at me like “ are you really not going to replace this “  but I ended up doing it
3537 2018-08-07 17:49:23 That's the dude from Midnight Oil, right?
3538 2018-08-07 17:49:18 オイルbotって何⁇とよく聞かれますが、…オイルはオイルですYO
3539 2018-08-07 17:49:17 i think jojobo oil or castor oil are better for growth?? coconut oil and almond oil help retain length. i could be Wrong though
3540 2018-08-07 17:49:15 Considering we protect their oil fields and them as well as supplying them with military equipment and other items. I highly doubt they would say anything if we said something. Oh wait we already did. Mr Bolton has already
3541 2018-08-07 17:49:12 castor oil
3542 2018-08-07 17:49:04 I agree that this is some sort of "hoax", and will be very interesting to see how it plays in the short term.  Make no mistake, I have no love for Musk or electric cars funded by Saudi oil money (LOL)--  just do what the charts tell me 
3543 2018-08-07 17:48:56 I use Noxzema and raw coconut oil
3544 2018-08-07 17:48:40 1/2 China future oil contracts in Yuan are already hitting the daily limits after #Trump issued warnings to countries doing business with #Iran. #China the world's top crude oil importer is looking to diminish the US dollar in oil market using Yuan in oil trades instead #IranDeal
3545 2018-08-07 17:48:40 I hate to see him turned into a martyr. It's all too easy to imagine Jones’ head superimposed on David's Death of Socrates with a speech bubble that says, “Our cod-liver has the highest midichlorian count of any cod-liver oil on the market.”
3546 2018-08-07 17:48:34 The empire of oil will come to a close, and when that happens the oil sheikhs will revolt having no more financial power, or resources.
This is 100% intentional, and the cabal aims to destabilize the economy, and start world war.
It can be avoided.

3557 2018-08-07 17:47:10 I know it's unrelated but Trump has manipulated oil prices (WTI) several times this year (blaming OPEC or saudi's 2 million additional production), no action was taken
3558 2018-08-07 17:47:04 Oil level?
3559 2018-08-07 17:46:59 Oil.
3560 2018-08-07 17:46:57 Swear every time I get an oil change there’s at least one fine ass Puerto Rican working
3561 2018-08-07 17:46:54 gov says something the Saudis don’t like,so the Saudis act and do stuff like pull the ambassador out,so what do we say in return..we can “easily” replace the saudi oil..more talk while Saudis act..this is the @JustinTrudeau weakness on the World Stage. #cdnpoli #680news
3562 2018-08-07 17:46:43 Wish we could have both, insane snake oil sellers and nipples on social media.
3563 2018-08-07 17:46:41 Too many buffoons in place and zero oil and gas experience. What a shame how Canada is slipping.
3564 2018-08-07 17:46:13 I'm hearing lots of Earth stories today! Besides the earthquakes, tornadoes, wildfires, work begins today to extract bulk oil which has been leaking from a sunken ship  (since 2013), off the coast of Newfoundland! Yeah! Cheers for Momma Earth! 
3565 2018-08-07 17:46:01 Please do the same thing with Venezuela. Stop buying and selling oil to maduro's regime.
3566 2018-08-07 17:45:32 i think im going to go into nude modeling bc i want nothing more than to have a genius artist spend 40 hours on a depiction of my ass in the form of a classic-style oil painting

3573 2018-08-07 17:45:04 have an irrational fear of driving into that little hole in the floor when I’m getting my oil changed
3574 2018-08-07 17:44:58 Koch yes, lots of stuff still unknown like, just revealed, his father’s oil supplied to hitler.

No Jones, we must just offer him our Thoughts and Prayers.
3575 2018-08-07 17:44:54 Does anybody really care about Saudi Arabia throwing a fit at us for calling them out on their bs? Once they run out of oil will they even be relevant anymore?
3576 2018-08-07 17:44:52 Yeah. But also, 70% of girls are 1, 20% are either 3 or 4, 1% are 2. The rest are medical students
3577 2018-08-07 17:44:50 Modern mayo is mostly (((soybean))) oil anyway

3579 2018-08-07 17:44:22 Oh, like psychological snake oil stuff? Take a pinch of the truth, mix with woo, be your best multidimensional self?
3580 2018-08-07 17:44:11 5% of oil consumption is directly tied to shipping the actual oil.

When oil prices are low, they use the worst & cheapest bunkering fuel possible, and that pollutes.
3581 2018-08-07 17:44:10 We only recycle about 10% of what we recycle because it’s cheaper to produce new from oil. It’s the companies that should be made responsible and forced to use more recycled plastic- nice one Lewis for bringing this to more ppl attention 
3582 2018-08-07 17:44:06 Sunday, August 12, 2018, during 11:00 am Worship, there will be anointing with oil, laying on of hands, and prayer offered for students attending/returning to college.

3586 2018-08-07 17:43:55 Can we add big agra and big oil to this? Corporate welfare ends up being a lot bigger than social services and student loans. The navy patrolling shipping lanes for big corporations comes to mind. They don't pay for that security, tax payers do. Heck many corps don't pay taxes.
3587 2018-08-07 17:43:54 two snake oil salesman?
3588 2018-08-07 17:43:49 Fayez, Canada has more oil than you guys do, we have the iron ore, the grains, the technology, the electrical generators and the armoured vehicles. You guys have got lots of sand and camel crap.  Still, think we're the losers?
3589 2018-08-07 17:43:29 and look how backwards you still are? Without oil you are nothing. That day is coming.
3590 2018-08-07 17:43:19 I use oil to moisturize my body and face but on days like this man...wtf
3591 2018-08-07 17:43:04 So, is America holding the world hostage, OR BUYING GAS FROM RUSSIA SOMETIMES? Because you can’t have it both ways! My husband works in the oil industry, and OBOZO TRIED REALLY HARD TO KILL IT! I know tens of thousands, who were laid off. Trump is working hard to reverse that.
3592 2018-08-07 17:43:03 @fordnation next campaign promise to be kept is the reduction of gasoline by 10 cents a litre. This will be accomplished by allowing oil companies to reduce their price by 10 cents a litre. No INCENTIVES ... promise kept #smh #ONpoli #BuckABeerBoycott
3593 2018-08-07 17:43:03 Tesla is dragging the auto industry by the shorts and curlies into an electric future they *really* don't want. And the Kochs and nearly every oil interest are out to crush him by any means possible; he's gonna cost them trillions.

3596 2018-08-07 17:42:34 Now show us where Canada exports our oil to
3597 2018-08-07 17:42:32 Seems like removing their ability to use US Banks/Bonds for oil trade was enough. Unclear how the situation is not already owned by that move. #OOTT
Cheers!
3598 2018-08-07 17:42:22 LOL and yet the information he presents has never been proven correct and in many cases has been proven wrong. Nice try with the sophistry and moving the goal post, but the man is a liar and a snake oil salesman.

3602 2018-08-07 17:42:04 So lets say he is serious. If you were say an oil giant looking at the rise of EV's and you had trillions sitting around it would make sense to back the biggest EV company.

3606 2018-08-07 17:41:34 And then, since they mismanaged “our” oil, they get sanctions and destabilization campaigns and finally regime change. Reagan actually spelled it all out transparently.

3610 2018-08-07 17:41:22 You would rather have a deceitful power broker who did more with Russia than any of the players involved.  Dow is at 25.6. GDP way up (Obama 3+ 5 of 32 qtrs).

3613 2018-08-07 17:41:08 Crap my co-workers have said today:

-Yes sir I’ll file a hurt feelings report 

-If David keeps playing that rock music in here I swear to Buddha i’m going to quit 

-who put oil on the toilet seat again

-I heard Luke is quitting so I brought in a cake with his face on it
3614 2018-08-07 17:41:00 I am looking not for me but a case like @mophie for IPhone 8 but not Mophie because the staff is great but the warranty is the worst ever.  It’s snake oil. It was bought at @Apple but can’t register it.  Mophie implied it was a fake.  @Apple do u sell fakes?

3617 2018-08-07 17:40:43 you know what’s gonna happen?.the more tough talk like we can easily replace Saudi oil is gonna make the Saudis make oil cost more and then we will pay more at pump b/c of #cdnpoli gov stupidity. #680news
3618 2018-08-07 17:40:34 And how does this fit with @lisamurkowski allowing Alaska to be wrecked for oil?
3619 2018-08-07 17:40:31 Oil?

3621 2018-08-07 17:40:22 They want to also drill for oil, mine, and frack
3622 2018-08-07 17:40:19 Not2 mention comments abt who supported dictators brings nothing 2 the table- by some1’s definition every president we had supported dictators 

My legit question is why we don’t take SA to task over 9/11 - I know someone’s going to say oil but more analysis would be 
3623 2018-08-07 17:40:19 @Samir_Madani has someone studied the possible effects of climate change related events on the oil supply chain?

3626 2018-08-07 17:39:57 You guys need to redo the entire equipment and consumables part of the game.  Half of the stuff is pointless.  How many people actually use oil or removed speed governors?  Anyone?
3627 2018-08-07 17:39:53 That oil won’t last forever.

3631 2018-08-07 17:39:38 "Tell me why we are friends with SA and foes of Iran !"

Compare the amount of proven oil reserves in the KSA with that of Iran; I think you'll have your answer . . .

3635 2018-08-07 17:39:30 lack of iranian oil on global market will increase demand for this oil.. especially as pipelines come on line in 2019 .. plus the news you just announced .... reinforces this ... but yes market mover prior ....
3636 2018-08-07 17:39:28 Lol you realize coconut oil isn’t a beauty product first? Lol it’s edible?
3637 2018-08-07 17:39:24 Money is just a paper rectangle with no value. Removal from the gold standard in the early 1970's was the end of value. All Oil purchases from the source controllers must be made in usa dollars to keep the presived value illusion alive
3638 2018-08-07 17:39:14 oh ya..we can “easily” replace Saudi Oil..then do it...if you do concerned about human rights then why you letting the saudis control our oil addiction..who said that anyways? #680news #onpoli #cdnpoli
3639 2018-08-07 17:39:10 U need some baby oil woman
3640 2018-08-07 17:39:05 So an oil fund in essence is interested in a car company which requires less oil? What is their goal?  to destroy the company and the EV market?
3641 2018-08-07 17:39:02 For a second there, I thought it was the lead singer for Midnight Oil....
3642 2018-08-07 17:38:58 Take some eggs.

Good luck. Hope it passes quick
3652 2018-08-07 17:37:37 is oil finally dead?
3653 2018-08-07 17:37:32 You take your unproven, 'fake science', big-pharma owned snake oil vaccines and just keep right on walking off the edge of the Earth, Mister.
3654 2018-08-07 17:37:28 We should as a nation stand together and boycott all things from Saudi Arabia including there oil 
In fact we should start refining straight from the oil sands for our own country and stop relying on others to do what we can do ourselves
3655 2018-08-07 17:37:27 I just remember seeing Richard Scorer (aptly named) looking like a snake oil salesman at a White Flowers meeting back in 2015 he was up to his neck in £££s too - another of bins mates.
3656 2018-08-07 17:37:21 Dear Prof. Hanke
In my belief before November election the lower oil prices is more important than sanctions for U.S. government
3657 2018-08-07 17:37:17 Wait, you gained weight from a vegetarian diet according to your doctor. What did he think you were doing, stuffing peppers with litres of olive oil and sluicing the lot down with a side of guacamole?

Gabapentin is horrid, I am sorry to hear this.
3658 2018-08-07 17:37:15 Oil rigs ex-North America rose by 27 m/m to 780 in July, driven by APAC (+12; China offshore +9) and Latam (+10; Colombia +5), Saudi oil rigs were unchanged at 60 -Baker Hughes #OOTT
3659 2018-08-07 17:36:55 Norway's government owns ALL oil reserves in Norway; StatOil is Norways biggest State OWNED oil company. Kuwait is also small. Scandanvia includes: Denmark, Finland, Norway, Iceland, Sweden, Holland.

3661 2018-08-07 17:36:37 President Jimmy Carter had a plan to get us off the oil teat in the 1970s.  It fell by the wayside when Republicans came in. Obama was stymied by GOP congress but still made headway including Paris Agreement. The planet won't die, it will be here but life will die.
3662 2018-08-07 17:36:34 Just like Rockefeller and Standard Oil
3663 2018-08-07 17:36:33 Getting the oil changed. Couples Court is on the TV. A woman in the waiting room is LOUDLY going on about how offensive it is. She has just demanded it be changed and left the office in a huff.
3664 2018-08-07 17:36:08 Ah, I use frozen garlic which has the same problem. Although the Leidenfrost effect is cool, well it is until you get hot oil on yourself.
3665 2018-08-07 17:35:52 the huge expansion in mortgages happens much much later, long after oil boom; & by then you don’t need to ‘recycle’ petrodollars at all — what a funny notion — everything happens via money makets; not to mention Asian surplus savings absolutely dwarf ‘petrodollars’ after mid 90s
3666 2018-08-07 17:35:51 Came home had my wash smothered my skin with lavender oil.. I'm beyond relaxed right now 
3667 2018-08-07 17:35:50 Yes you vape the oil
3668 2018-08-07 17:35:43 Lately people keep asking me how as a massage therapist I manage to not get oil on my clothes while working & I’m always standing there in a tshirt with oil stains on it like...ummm I don’t?
3669 2018-08-07 17:35:39 متحاملين على السيتي وملاك السيتي .. اذكر كنت اتناقش مع جماهير انجليزية هنا كلهم يردون نفس الرد oil اويل اويل اويل
3670 2018-08-07 17:35:34 You store it in a container until you can recycle it or just throw the container away if there's no place to recycle cooking oil in your area. Looks like there are places in Bucks County but not farther north. :-(
3671 2018-08-07 17:35:19 They make you set appointments at the dealership. I’ve been here for 2 1/2 hours for an oil change. Checked on my car n they said 30 more mins!!!!! Y’all had to dig the oil up or what cause it doesn’t take 3 hours to change oil

3673 2018-08-07 17:35:13 At least shorts are consistent in their investing ideology. Enjoy the s/p gains that Big Oil has provided you now that SA has a 4% in the company. Sell your shares, take the shill money, and go find some other dumpster fire to throw your cash in.
3674 2018-08-07 17:35:10 Until he sit down with them and they pinky swear to never ever make nuclear weapons again and reduce oil prices and eliminate all terrorists!  Promise ... REALLY!!  Pinky swear!!
3675 2018-08-07 17:35:04 If Reham Khan stoops any lower she will discover oil reserves.
3676 2018-08-07 17:34:50 U can vape the oil? I thought the e liquid was for vaping
3677 2018-08-07 17:34:35 Argan oil. Even shinier 
3678 2018-08-07 17:34:33 Hello HR? I’d like to report a hostile work environment. Someone in the break room is talking about avocado oil
3679 2018-08-07 17:34:27 I cant wait to go home and use @theouai body oil and drink wine
3680 2018-08-07 17:34:25 True—It’s asinine the nuclear deal was scrapped in the first place. *War profiteering.

As for FDR, Japan was driving through China and the Pacific—leaving destruction and death in its wake. Oil had to be cutoff. Japan chose to attack Pearl Harbor, over ceasing it’s war machine.
3681 2018-08-07 17:34:17 Seams there are some bullies there to. Just buy oil from other countries and see what happens next
3682 2018-08-07 17:34:16 Why don't you read Oil Kings and the Spiro book, and then we can have an informed conversation.
3683 2018-08-07 17:34:12 I thought Venezuela was a Socialist counter point? 

Venezuela was never either. Maduro claims to be a socialist, but hasn't put in place any socialist policies. The man's a dictator and his country only has an economy based on oil. There are far more issues than ideology at play
3684 2018-08-07 17:34:09 It hurts everyone, except oil company, refinery owners.

Even if you don’t own a car, truck distribution of American goods, farm produce means that increase has to go somewhere.  We ALL suffer.

3686 2018-08-07 17:33:53 Helps get smooth and oil free skin: Beat one egg-white until stiff w/ lemon juice. Apply on your skin for 20 mins. Rinse w/ lukewarm water.
3687 2018-08-07 17:33:48 Mike, I feel you man. We'll just take our third world little selves away and with us, our depleted oil reserves our expansive fisheries and a massive trade surplus. We'll just about manage and we'll stop being a drain you. You won't even notice we're gone, honest. 
3688 2018-08-07 17:33:47 You've done nothing but  cause oil prices % gas to rise. Your a disgrace and I can't wait for impeachment day and its coming.

3690 2018-08-07 17:33:36 My mom is so irritating when she says “it just need a lil oil” when she’s talking about my hair. GIRL it’s a whole bottle of castor oil in here, my natural hair not bouta look like a shiny new wig moe.
3691 2018-08-07 17:33:33 Why is Zinke Still there? He’s destroying national parks and bidding them out to mining and oil drilling! This needs to STOP NOW! Preserve our National Treasures!
3692 2018-08-07 17:33:30  that 4G oil lmao
3693 2018-08-07 17:33:17 No puede ser. Es lo mismo cuando los europeos le quieren decir a los africanos cómo conservar sus recursos naturales. O cuando los ricos les quieren dar lecciones de empleo a los pobres. O cuando las mamás les quieren limpiar el culo a los niños. Ah no espérame tantito.
3694 2018-08-07 17:33:09 Why GVRD only? BC is a big province and our demand is provincial as is our rail system.
The pipeline is intended to replace the Puget Sound's supply of refined fuels. That is where all the oil-by-rail is going.

That being said show me how we reduce demands and we can chat.

3696 2018-08-07 17:33:04 Kingdom of Kuwait and Norway have diverse economies they aren't dependent on oil. Kuwait is an extremely small country enjoying rewards of Black gold like most Gulf State. Kuwait has highest valued currency in world and NO TAX!
3697 2018-08-07 17:32:58 Dear @naturetractors I find this to be exceptional validating our concept of the highly cited lawnmower hence I recommend publication with no changes except an oil change.
3698 2018-08-07 17:32:56 Your plan doesn't meet the target that Harper set, that your campaign said was 'the floor' and that the Paris Agreement says needs to be ratcheted up. You gave the oil sands 100Mt of that 2030 carbon budget. You are giving EITE breaks.  Who do you think is going to reduce GHGs?

3701 2018-08-07 17:32:35 A. this is a report on a British archival doc and you may find many more hints of this thinking at the Pentagon if you look up the frus vols for the 1973 war and the oil crisis. B. I didn't say that Gulf Petro$$ were not deposted in EU & JAP banks.
3702 2018-08-07 17:32:21 I used to like using chopped garlic from them lil jars you get but god would they cause a firestorm when I would put them into a pan with hot oil
3703 2018-08-07 17:32:18 We impose sanctions. Iran stops the flow of oil that passes through their waters and this my friend starts a whole lot of problems with threats of war with Iran which would be over in a few days.
3704 2018-08-07 17:32:10 Can we stop shipments of oil from them?

Oh yea.....  we aren’t yet self sustainable when it come to our energy needs.

And whose fault is that? 

The Liberals and their left wing supporters are ruining it for all Canadians with their shortsighted plans.
3705 2018-08-07 17:31:58 I love vinaigrette too! But this is slightly different. Dressing = chilli oil, Chinkiang rice vinegar, caster sugar, toasted ground Szechuan peppers, crushed garlic and light soy sauce.
3706 2018-08-07 17:31:49 Like so many other good things in this life: it's all in the wrist. 
You can't be heavy-handed with it in the manner of Nigella 'drizzling' olive oil over everything (including herself and her kitchen floor for a light spot of wrestling).
3707 2018-08-07 17:31:32 Correct.  Monopolists who today pose much more of a threat to society than the oil companies ever did  because of their ideological filters are Facebook, Google, Twitter because they undermine open discussion on topics they disagree with.
3708 2018-08-07 17:31:26 I acknowledge you are an expert in the oil and gas sector.  

Now help me out here.

How many eastern Canada refineries are designed to process heavy oil or bitumen?

How much would it cost refiners to reconfigure their sites to take Alberta bitumen over Saudi oil?

Stil d guys side?
3712 2018-08-07 17:31:11 Good point Colin. I don’t know of anyone who takes regular fish oil for heart health (except maybe krill?) but I think most take it for long term brain health.

3717 2018-08-07 17:30:53 My anxiety is so annoying to where I go to the same places for my oil changes ,nails, grocery, anything is always the same spot.
3718 2018-08-07 17:30:50 I'll admit I have an agenda.... but cycling is incidental. I'm mainly concerned about carbon, oil and pollution. Clean air and safe streets.
3719 2018-08-07 17:30:35 No, we don’t. We just import oil (to make gasoline) that supplies most of eastern Canada. If only our  turd of a PM would remove all barriers to get an oil pipeline built, we could become less dependent on other countries, like the U.S. have been doing for years now.
3720 2018-08-07 17:30:35 Someone told me amber oil was his secret and i figured id cop it but dont know the appropriate levels of it yet and no one is helpin me out

3729 2018-08-07 17:30:13 Only if you agree to the following terms:

1. We’re talking about GVRD only. The concepts & numbers can be extrapolated to other regions.
2. The bar is to demonstrate that reductions in consumption mean TMX expansion, oil-by-rail, etc, aren't “needed”.
3. No oil exports.

Deal?
3730 2018-08-07 17:30:08 I think what makes them so upset is foreign affairs is led by a women, they hate being "told" (suggested) what to do, more so by a women. Any human rights they have are for show for the outside world. We do not need to sell them arms or buy their oil. #EnergyEast #HumanRights.
3731 2018-08-07 17:30:05 That's old news and we can't dug out because if we'll be doing this then Iran's oil will also comes to us.
3732 2018-08-07 17:30:03 Me at 16: tanning in a tanning bed every day and using spf 4 tanning oil whenever I’m in the sun

3733 2018-08-07 17:30:00 That is happening a bit, & for good reasons - who better to build wind turbines than those who once built oil rigs. BUT… eg workers often lack an effective voice as they’re in small firms and not unionised. 20,000 solar jobs disappeared, unions didn’t bat an eyelid
3734 2018-08-07 17:29:55 What’s the difference? You hadn’t heard of Chelsea until the oil money
3735 2018-08-07 17:29:41 Folks, this could be very bad for us TSLA shorts. The Saudi fund is dumb enough, and wealthy enough, to do this. And they could possibly delude themselves that this is some kind of hedge for their oil wealth. For the first time, I am worried about my short position.
3736 2018-08-07 17:29:40 The issue with Jones is he repeatedly violated TOS on private platforms . He still has options ( such as his website ) to market his snake oil and spew his bullshit .
3737 2018-08-07 17:29:40 Thank you Olive oil baby
3738 2018-08-07 17:29:39 He’s smart enough not to joke about that. 
My prediction is Saudi is part of the funding, won’t have say, just are investing for future to offset loss of oil revenue. 
Tesla is an energy company.
3739 2018-08-07 17:29:37 Well analysed dear. But I think most of these guys are just trying to be humble. They can be fine o but may have bad handwriting
3740 2018-08-07 17:29:33 Psst. It aint for world peace, it's for big oil.
3741 2018-08-07 17:29:26 Yup, they did. LOL
3742 2018-08-07 17:29:21 LOL We do 3-4 billion in trade with Saudi, which is negligible. The bit of oil we get from KSA we can get elsewhere. It won’t have any impact. KSA is not a major trading partner, even if you want to imagine you are.

3744 2018-08-07 17:29:17 rose cbd oil. need.
3745 2018-08-07 17:29:02 Should be sleep but my car needs an oil change 
3746 2018-08-07 17:28:55 Because that’s just what Saudi Arabia needs. A flourishing car brand that DOESN’T USE OIL!!!!
3747 2018-08-07 17:28:50 In a free society, it is not your business what people choose to spend their money on. If I choose to spend my money on the traveling snake oil salesmen’s miracle cure, its is not your/anyone’s role to tell me I can’t. This is no different then what I choose to listen to or watch
3748 2018-08-07 17:28:49 And American English continues to slide all over the place like baby oil. Enabling the users to slather on fascism at the ready.
3749 2018-08-07 17:28:42 I believe plan B is to lavish Scotland with promises and rains of cash to ensure a no vote and their stranglehold on our oil and brands.
3750 2018-08-07 17:28:41 Chris has lost it. LOL
3751 2018-08-07 17:28:28 Stop importing their oil in eastern Canada. The 5000 jobs would be easily recouped building a pipeline from western Canada. And that $15bil, would easily be made up by this too.
3752 2018-08-07 17:28:24 Alex Jones is a conspiracy theorist who spouts nonsense in order to sell snake oil to his listeners, he's not exchanging any ideas.  Also, isn't forcing a private company to do something against their will a violation of every conservative principle ever?
3753 2018-08-07 17:28:24 bio oil saved my life
3754 2018-08-07 17:28:23 So you think you know oil and gas? #TuesdayTrivia 
What is the name commonly given to the liquid used in drilling a well?
3755 2018-08-07 17:28:17 LOL so how silly is this? Today I could devour some sweet treats but because of the slimmer I am using and the oil I just don't crave sweet treats :) lol...just a silly thought of the day :)
3756 2018-08-07 17:28:02 oh ya..we can easily cover saudi oil..where then why the hell are we still buying it..”easily” smh..what a snobby liberal government point of view ..then do it anyways?!! man smh. #680news #cdnpoli
3757 2018-08-07 17:28:00 Continuing to burn coal, oil, and natural gas for energy is like rolling up car windows on a hot summer day.

3758 2018-08-07 17:27:56 Congrats Ontario & Quebec for giving the US,Alberta’s only export customer Canada’s oil at a 30’/, discount. Ont & Que buy all foreign oil & get Tens of Billions in Oil Equalization Welfare money from Alberta.
Its actually unbelievable! A pipeline would earn Billions for Canada.
3759 2018-08-07 17:27:55  diversifying? The problem is that big auto isn’t behind oil replacement, they’re watching to see what works and what doesn’t. 

Then they’ll they’ll salt the tent out back to make sure another one is never built.
3760 2018-08-07 17:27:54 The question you should be asking yourself, "Why would the Saudi's, one of the worlds largest oil producers and arguably the lowest cost producer of oil, want to buy the worlds most successful electric car company?"...... hmmm, can't for the life of me think of why. 
3761 2018-08-07 17:27:50 Please be advised that the original crimping oil formulation known as CRIMPX and manufactured by Glenveigh Developments Ltd has been discontinued and is no longer available.
3762 2018-08-07 17:27:47 70% of guys are either 3 or 4, 25% are 1 and then there is the other 5%
3763 2018-08-07 17:27:36 At this rate I either start downing olive oil straight from the bottle or slowly fade away. 4-5 shots a day should do the trick.
3764 2018-08-07 17:27:34 Power to the northern elite is WAR

They would do anything to have it 

North and south can work 
Oil and water can't mix

3765 2018-08-07 17:27:32 Anybody in my timeline knows someone from Cuba? I have an oil painting of Che Guevara which I made some 4 years back. 
Would like to get in touch with someone who might want to purchase it....
3766 2018-08-07 17:27:25 The wildfires burning up the Okanagan and spreading smoke East through Alberta this week are brought to you by the Oil and Gas Industry. The Oil and Gas Industry reminds you to ask yourself why you even brought children into this world!
3767 2018-08-07 17:27:24 We starting another war for oil and opium?

3769 2018-08-07 17:27:05 Let's all continue to move away from oil then
3770 2018-08-07 17:27:04 I was going to apply this rose oil moisturizer on the bus till this woman entirely ruined my mood
3771 2018-08-07 17:27:02 They start by cleaning the place,  like of let us get rid of all this bad stuff,  old batteries old oil,  it's so bad for you,  
3772 2018-08-07 17:27:01 It uses 6 Boeing Jumbo jets for fly away, and then their trucks for Europe! It would hardly be scratching the surface of what all the passenger/commercial planes, huge oil tankers/cargo ships, lorrys, diesel cars are already doing!
3773 2018-08-07 17:26:56 Trying this new thing with my hair... Washing and only using organic aloe & jojoba oil
3774 2018-08-07 17:26:41 Stop buying from Saudi, build the #TransMountain pipeline for export markets, #EnergyEast for domestic, and expand refining capacity. We need to stop shooting ourselves in the foot and support the Canadian oil industry.
3775 2018-08-07 17:26:25 My furnace did that. Every time the exhaust blower turned on, it started to howl, all night, on and off. Called a repair guy on emergency basis next morning. He put three drops of oil in it, charged me $400.
3776 2018-08-07 17:26:25 If the #US wants #energy independence surely the logical route is to introduce more stringent #fuel economy standards and reduce #oil consumption? Currently a net importer of ~7m bbd
3777 2018-08-07 17:26:24 I’ve been thinking about taking CBD oil for general health so I’m following a few CBD companies. Anxiety treatment is one of its most common uses, although there are many. Just a thought if that’s something you’d like to look into. Hope you’re better very soon!

3782 2018-08-07 17:26:02 Ah yes, pinching mandibles. Perfect for handling oil!
3783 2018-08-07 17:25:57 CBD Oil has helped me gain my weight back, I was 108 pounds 8 months ago and was introduced to the oil in March and I'm at my old weight again 130.. it's like magic !
3784 2018-08-07 17:25:55 Oh yeahh. What type of oil? Cheers though X
3785 2018-08-07 17:25:47 tea tree oil will honestly do the job
3786 2018-08-07 17:25:47 Its literally powder in an aerosol can. It dries up the excess oil in your hair so you don't have to actually wash it as often which is healthier for your hair and scalp.
3787 2018-08-07 17:25:42 Wind and solar is a farce that requires huge maintenance and oil in its production/distribution. Nuclear is the way to go and hemp plastic.

3796 2018-08-07 17:25:07 I mean fox news hasn’t been banned. Then again fox news isn’t selling snake oil.
3797 2018-08-07 17:25:06 Ah. So you have bought the snake oil that Trump sold you. Lol
3798 2018-08-07 17:25:05 The realized price of crude oil and natural gas was $60.98 per barrel and $3.19 per Mcf, respectively, down from $61.29 per barrel and $3.39 per Mcf in Q1.
3799 2018-08-07 17:25:00 These megacorps are basically trusts who are avoiding the (rightful) application of antitrust laws by doing the bidding of certain elements of our government. They are the modern Standard Oil. It's time to break them up or regulate them as public utilities.
3800 2018-08-07 17:24:55 Corollary: those who are funded by the biggest beneficiary of the misplaced  AGW theory, namely govt, do more of a disservice to actual science than oil companies, because at least they fund both sides.
3801 2018-08-07 17:24:54 You shouldn’t cold stop hydro, it will really mess you up. I went from 4mg 4x a day-4mg 3x a day-3mg 4x a day-3mg 3x a day-2mg 4x a day etc, every 5 days down to the point where I was only taking 1 mg morning and night. The CBD oil helped so much on top of this weaning.

3807 2018-08-07 17:23:50 I get giardinera on the side when I get a beef sandwich so I can pull out the carrots to put on the sandwich and pour some of the oil on as well.

3811 2018-08-07 17:23:35 Western nations have taken a lot of Saudi’s dirty oil $ that they’re all shying away from defending Canada & are looking at less confrontational ways of dousing the situation instead of taking the bull by the horns, guess it’s coz the Saudis know a lot of the West’s dirty secrets

3817 2018-08-07 17:23:19 BoR rate setter McCafferty says it's reasonable to have a couple of more rate hikes. Were is the evidence for this?

3821 2018-08-07 17:22:48 A2) Some (NDP?) say that we should keep oil in the ground, or enforce a high $$ carbon tax to spur clean energy innovation.

3828 2018-08-07 17:21:56 Let’s get on with the advancement of the electric age. Big oil wants our dependence on fossil fuel to continue until they wring the last dollar out of the last drop, and will do anything in they’re power (which is vast) to continue
3829 2018-08-07 17:21:47 I'm not thrilled about how much power big tech corporations can wield, but banning Alex Jones is pretty much the opposite of a slippery slope. They reluctantly removed a lying snake oil salesman *after* he got hit with massive lawsuits and bad press.
3830 2018-08-07 17:21:44 Nothing shady about HSBC at all.  They have simply decided to court the "green" constituency believing they will gain incremental business by shunning the oil sands people. That kind of "pick and choose" should warrant many firms to look elsewhere. It could happen to ANY sector.
3831 2018-08-07 17:21:41 WTI oil at $69.77/barrel, +$0.76 on expectations of tighter global supply due to revived U.S. sanctions against major crude exporter Iran.

3846 2018-08-07 17:20:03 I'm not sure how they are related. How will an export pipeline on the west coast affect private corporations on the east coast buying oil from the Saudi's?

He refused chemo and took cannabis oil instead....

3869 2018-08-07 17:18:14 Damn I’ve had my car for 3 days and it’s already telling me it’s time for an oil change.
3870 2018-08-07 17:18:13 I assume oil and misogyny.
3871 2018-08-07 17:18:07 Are the Germans not willing to go die for oil in the middle east any longer? Who would've thought
3872 2018-08-07 17:18:03 You brought the deficit down by creating $800M in new taxes and fees, supported by an increase in oil prices. Since “oil is not a policy” and there isn’t another $800M in taxes to raise, what’s the plan now?
3873 2018-08-07 17:18:02 I’m supposed to get an oil change TODAY and if I do it it’ll be the first time I got one exactly when I’m supposed to
3874 2018-08-07 17:18:02 Fool me once, shame on me. Fool me twice... oh, fuck it, just take all my money and invest it in oil pipelines that destroy native lands and precious ecosystems.
3875 2018-08-07 17:17:57 Ooh, yum. I’ll do that next time. They hold olive oil super well, I can imagine they’d be great with cheese.
3876 2018-08-07 17:17:49 I need to change my oil in my car so bad but I forget to do it every day 
3877 2018-08-07 17:17:48 It's penetrating oil for rusty nuts and bolts. So, sort of. It works pretty well. 
But let me reiterate...
PENETRATING oil.
It PENETRATES NUTS.
3878 2018-08-07 17:17:44 Urs is definitely no. 1
3879 2018-08-07 17:17:42 @brucebusiness if you talk about a barrel of oil , how many litres is a barrel .

3884 2018-08-07 17:17:10 Tax deduction ideas for artists that tour: Car insurance, fuel, tolls, parking, mileage, public transportation (for gigs, rehearsals, meetings), vehicle repairs/maintenance (tire patching, fluid flushes, windshield repair), oil changes, washing/vacuuming, vehicle/loan interest

3888 2018-08-07 17:16:57 Lol disagree fr what
3889 2018-08-07 17:16:56 In effect we agree Socialist policy propped up by capitalist oil economy when capitalism had hiccup socialism failed completely as it relied 100% on capitalism success & socialism response wasnt to fix economy but to attempt to falsely keep socialism going resulting in inflation
3890 2018-08-07 17:16:43 Ha ha..aapko ye zaroor taste Karna chahiye. Na oil na panner..Authentic food..
3891 2018-08-07 17:16:42 In no way I’m brushing all the snail oil stuff that has passed before! Neither should I be rejoicing in a well balanced card, however, this year has been great on the whole so glad a card like this is ticking it over
3892 2018-08-07 17:16:42 Giant piles of money built off old industries will end up owning the future. See: commercial real estate, transportation / oil
3893 2018-08-07 17:16:40 To be quite honest, pipelines don't help us.  We export all of our oil, and then pay MORE for gas than the people buying our oil do.

3896 2018-08-07 17:16:30 Them offering onsite oil changes at my job is clutch af. Make an extra trip for whet?!
3897 2018-08-07 17:16:21 How about we build a pipeline to Eastern CANADA, and support CANADA!! We can buy oil from a clown who puts kids in cages, starts a trade ware with us or a country that leads the world in public executions and is a champion of women's rights! @JustinTrudeau @RachelNotley
3898 2018-08-07 17:15:58 I’m good I ran outta baby oil over here
3899 2018-08-07 17:15:56 And kale and quinoa and coconut oil ...
3900 2018-08-07 17:15:52 Check your Transmission oil this weekend.
3901 2018-08-07 17:15:47 hmmm well we wanted to buy 1 bill $ worth of us weapons and a little iranian oil
GUESS WE SPEND THE 1 BILL. $ FOR THE WEAPONS ELSEWHERE .....and just buy the little iranian oil
3902 2018-08-07 17:15:47 As well as savings on forage seeds we group source a full range of cereal & oil seeds and cover crops so why not dm us with your requirements and see how much we can save you?
3903 2018-08-07 17:15:46 Remember the oil sanctions US place on Japan in 1940. Pearl Harbor one year later!
3904 2018-08-07 17:15:46 Indeed oil price will go up another factor being new US sanctions on Iran which came into effect last night and 2nd round of sanction are coming November. This will have a direct impact on oil prices

3907 2018-08-07 17:15:24 Aww you did the switcharoo! Well we’ll have to see. I don’t have much hope for any of us tbh. It’s 39 degrees in Paris Sweden’s on fire, and we have oil companies that see the melting tundra as great new opportunity to drill more oil. It’s f*cked

3909 2018-08-07 17:15:18 Heartlands Parkway, M6 an oil painting, so everything approaching is too
3910 2018-08-07 17:15:09 It might be needed to prevent a takeover from the oil industry.  Not really sure why he went public in the first place, given this risk.
3911 2018-08-07 17:15:07 waiting for my oil change to be done. it has already been nearly an hour
3912 2018-08-07 17:15:07 Well worn counters, perfectly-aged oil, residual cigarette smoke from 1976?
3913 2018-08-07 17:15:02 I disagree joo
3914 2018-08-07 17:14:57 I have hot coffee, iced tea, @12AMVenus, doused the room in clove oil & lit at least three candles. I am now prepared for patch day.

3917 2018-08-07 17:14:51 I'd have to look at what he posts (not YOUR interpretation) and most importantly how much he lies but says it's truth. How often he targets victims of horrific crimes as actors. Or does Farrakhan harass restaurants & push conspiracies? Does he hawk snake oil?
3918 2018-08-07 17:14:40 @MassSave Are there energy audits for oil heated properties?
3919 2018-08-07 17:14:38 My skin is the fakest bitch. I literally use tea tree oil + witch hazel every day and night and just when I see my skin clearing up, it betrays me and breaks out smh
3920 2018-08-07 17:14:36 Pake bio oil
3921 2018-08-07 17:14:28 Serious question for the crude oil crowd:

Does it not make sense that the Saudis are investing a ton in $TSLA because they know *exactly* how much oil will be soon?

Or is this just Idiot Level Conspiracy Nonsense?

I'll hang up and listen.
3922 2018-08-07 17:14:24 i’m so overdue on an oil change man. i don’t wanna go :/
3923 2018-08-07 17:14:13 One of my go-to snacks for a long time was a cut up tomato with salt, pepper, and a bit of olive oil.
3924 2018-08-07 17:14:06 I don't understand how people can get away with calling this infrastructure. Nothing could be further from the truth. This for giant multinational  oil corporations to pull wealth from our indigenous.
3925 2018-08-07 17:13:52 Well said Sir 
Indeed it was but we ware the sick man of Europe 

we ware just months away from a IMF deadline due to the Oil crisis of 1973-76 & the Bad management policy of Gov Assets

Then Germany, the Netherlands & Denmark came for the help

This is now in history books
3926 2018-08-07 17:13:51  sorry
3927 2018-08-07 17:13:47 Échense 100% pure black castor oil en las cejas y las pestañas. De nada.
3928 2018-08-07 17:13:30 Actually  Venezuela has more oil...and Canada is third...we dont need your oil,  we have a lot more of something more valuable than oil , its called fresh drinking water
3929 2018-08-07 17:13:24 The games afoot Watson! Nukes for LA or some oil tanker heading into New York, Or swarms of drones loaded with explosives hitting a major downtown area at rush hour?
3930 2018-08-07 17:13:24 Awww. Tew bad!!!
3931 2018-08-07 17:13:22 I was on hydro, and a heavy dose. It took 6 weeks to slowly wean me off. Luckily dilaudid only lasts a few days in your body, unluckily getting off it is a bitch as your brain chem changes and the withdrawal is extreme. Maybe you are experiencing this?

CBD oil helped me A LOT.
3932 2018-08-07 17:13:18 We take the oil, gas and water. You either die of thirst or cold. Take your pick
3933 2018-08-07 17:13:18 I slipped in a puddle of oil and I’m covered in it
3934 2018-08-07 17:13:17 He's backing Russia and Israel.  Russia was going broke with the low oil prices

3951 2018-08-07 17:11:55 But it’s ok for the (Paul Martins) shipping company brining oil back from  the Middle East to Nova Scotia .  Liberals .... way to go.
3952 2018-08-07 17:11:55 So much for big oil as “shorty”...
3953 2018-08-07 17:11:53 The only way we will ever compete on a regular basis  is if we are bought with oil money. Some man has to come in and buy us and treat us as his pastime. Exactly like city and Chelsea. 2 nothin clubs until the oil money came in. (And pushed us out )
3954 2018-08-07 17:11:50 Who knew such a mild rebuke would draw such a vehement reaction? Ultra sensitive. They now allow women to drive & watch football. Big yay. For those minor changes they expect unconditional praise. No more Canadian arms to Saudi & we use our own oil, both good ideas in themselves.
3955 2018-08-07 17:11:49 Where can I get an oil change that won’t take me all day
3956 2018-08-07 17:11:48 Coconut oil in my coffee.
3957 2018-08-07 17:11:38 The west would love to see civil war start so that they loot the OIL, Nigeria  people be on the look out and don’t fall to their trap .. remember most African leaders are their puppets for use then damped
3958 2018-08-07 17:11:26 You're on public transit I'm from the bay I no how it is I no how people are you ain't saying nothing slick 2 a can of oil don't try to play you was uncomfortable card. It is not that you said no you want 2 record it then you want 2 post it on social media which makes us look bad
3959 2018-08-07 17:11:19 These oil pens come in clutch 
3960 2018-08-07 17:11:10 Of cooking oil.
3961 2018-08-07 17:11:01 Dear @gbkburgers 

Would you please tell me if the dishes marked as vegan on your menu are cooked using the same oil as non-vegan dishes, or if they're cooked, for example, using the same utensils & pans without being washed beforehand.

With gratitude :)
3962 2018-08-07 17:10:59 Idk.. Sort of want to hold my long position until after you have desimated both the auto and oil industries.. What would my shares be worth then, in 5, 10, 20 years? $500? $1k? 10k? How many splits by then?  "If I had a million dollars..." I would buy you ... Tesla Stock...
3963 2018-08-07 17:10:57 I have never finished s bottle of olive oil - or a blue pen, or a notebook, or Tabasco - in my life
This is not because I’m a bezos but because a) I lose everything and b) I have four siblings 

Respect to you.
3964 2018-08-07 17:10:52 #EIA says higher output from OPEC and Russia in H2 likely put pressure on crude #oil; expects #Brent spot prices to fall towards $70/barrel by end of 2018 in fairly balanced mkt. But notes low stocks, spare capacity make volatility and price increases possible if supply disrupted
3965 2018-08-07 17:10:49 Actually makes sense. As oil becomes less and less important in the world, why not invest in batteries and the future of transportation.
3966 2018-08-07 17:10:48 Coffee + 1tsp of coconut oil + creamer of your choice.... mix it in a blender for 5-10 seconds = cheap frothy coffee that gives you life

3969 2018-08-07 17:10:42 Maybe the Saudis want to get out of the Crude Oil business  .... $TSLA
3970 2018-08-07 17:10:40 I would love to. A complete head to toe hot oil massage.  I promise complete satisfaction.
3971 2018-08-07 17:10:34 I m sure it's three
3972 2018-08-07 17:10:34 girl i have one too!! haven’t had an oil burn since then. truly, magical 
3973 2018-08-07 17:10:24 Pure snake oil salesman
3974 2018-08-07 17:10:22 —glance to Ba’al before looking back at the menu. “Yeah, chinese then, that sounds good. Thanks, again, for offering. Maybe I should do the bare minimum more often since it gets me bath oil and takeout.”
3975 2018-08-07 17:10:15 15. Congress has allowed hospitals, health clinics to charge extremely high prices for doctors visits, medical tests, medical procedures, prescription drugs, etc.  Congress has allowed oil, coal to increase our health care costs by trillions of dollars over time - pollution.
3976 2018-08-07 17:10:06 And where do you think you’re getting your oil from 
3977 2018-08-07 17:10:06 ああ、これ？スポーツブラ。油の貯蔵庫が垂れちゃうからね。
3978 2018-08-07 17:10:00 used these coconut oil brands for hair care from childhood in India and they don’t give a strong odour.
3979 2018-08-07 17:09:58 Annnd I just got catcalled again. Second time in what, a month?  What the heck is in the water lately?  (besides the NS power oil spill)
3980 2018-08-07 17:09:53 Good thing Eastern Canada would rather buy and refine Saudi Oil, rather than Canadian. #EnergyEast
3981 2018-08-07 17:09:48 And that statement from Irving oil from 2016 saying that even if the energy east pipeline was built, they would still want as much Saudi oil as they currently refine, says volumes about the east.
3982 2018-08-07 17:09:40 あぶらせんせのすごいあついエール！！！！！すごい！！！！！！がんばってかいていつか！！！！！！！おわらせるので！！！！！！いきるので！！！！！！ありがとう圧迫祭りよ！！！！！！
3983 2018-08-07 17:09:38 Yeah like China cares.. they have been reducing US oil orders based on reports we've all seen
3984 2018-08-07 17:09:36 Nakahanap ka na ba? Try allday supermarket, human nature carries sunflower oil nasa less than 200 pesos lang ata yung large bottle :)) nasa may shampoo section siya
3985 2018-08-07 17:09:25 Yes replacing it with more outside oil sounds much saner than building a pipeline and not using domestic oil ! Poor Canada
3986 2018-08-07 17:09:14 Hashanah great  oil is going to hit $160 in coming months ,interesting days ahead 
3987 2018-08-07 17:08:54 God bless coconut oil
3988 2018-08-07 17:08:48 Had to mail more CBD oil so Trading Post Southwest is open now
3989 2018-08-07 17:08:42 I have never understood the WHY although I imagine OIL is the why.
This situation is so Machiavellian and twisted.

I wonder if this is why Venezuela's Maduro is being attacked? They have the largest oil reserves in the world.
3990 2018-08-07 17:08:32 have not fared so well at oil & gas exploration/production.  (Nigeria?) Before you pat your back too hard, you might pick up a history book about how well your industry has done at helping the "energy impoverished" to use your language. 2/2
3991 2018-08-07 17:08:31 @WholeFoods failed me today with nasty, oil soaked vegetables. My lunch was ruined 
3992 2018-08-07 17:08:23 When they close strait of hormuz and unsecured bab al mandab ,and all of this began another  war in persian gulf,and billon around the world sufferd from increastion of oil praise,world will realize american notion of WORLD PEACE
3993 2018-08-07 17:08:20 No. 2 
3994 2018-08-07 17:08:12 Great way for Sauds to pivot from oil to electric.  makes perfect sense.
3995 2018-08-07 17:07:56 Also look out for "Jamie Cooks Italy" His new series starting soon. Awful stuff, he really needs to work on his wording. Expect many classic Italian recipes to be ruined by his olive oil fetish
3996 2018-08-07 17:07:55 the girl in the desk next to me used coconut oil this morning and i am VERY allergic to coconut and it gave me a bad reaction to a point where i can’t even be at my desk. friendly reminder to do your skin care routine shit at home so your coworkers don’t possibly suffer like i am
3997 2018-08-07 17:07:54 Cheating is one thing...but you let that nigga use my castor oil. . .
3998 2018-08-07 17:07:54 Rub them with olive oil, apparently. Olive oil everywhere
3999 2018-08-07 17:07:50 I took my car yesterday to the Chevy to get an oil change and tire rotation and it’s still not done
4000 2018-08-07 17:07:45 But it doesn't. Theres a massive rift between tesla and profits thats only just being addressed, massive resistance from big oil, and unjustifiable reports bashing the cars. This sounds like what a scrappy upstart ev company should be
4001 2018-08-07 17:07:38 DSS boss knew he would be sacked before it became official. Probably on a site inspection now to see his oil block. No be today! 

Naija naija! ... House of card! , dont be on the losing side sha. Lol. 

Proud Nigerian!
4002 2018-08-07 17:07:35 Support Canada and their brave stance on human rights.   Saudis: free the Badawis; your regime is oppressive and will find no cover this time.   Oil for weapons with the west will dry up someday along with your misdeeds.
4003 2018-08-07 17:07:29 A couple of value studies from Etretat today. Both 10" x12" oil on panel Plein Air paintings. Still hotel hunting for future painting trips
4004 2018-08-07 17:07:20 Engine oil can solve this problem shikina
4005 2018-08-07 17:07:19 KSA  needs to cozy up to the USA - without USA support and weapons, the House of Saud is a goner. Time is not on their side, best way to cement their position, is to alienate longtime allies like Cda. We are also in the unique position, of being able to challenge Saudi oil
4006 2018-08-07 17:07:14 I feel like as a female whenever I take my car to get an oil change or anything they try to swindle me. When I went with my uncle they didn’t require none of the shit they told me when I was by myself.

4008 2018-08-07 17:07:00 my mama just asked her nigga y he smell like baby oil  I instantly thought of madea 
4009 2018-08-07 17:06:59 Our allies wouldn't be buying their gas/oil from Russia or give money and access to the financial systems to a terrorist nation who regularly chants death to America.
4010 2018-08-07 17:06:40 Just listened to Mark Papa address likely gas shut-ins in the S Delaware.  That will certainly impact S Delaware oil production in '19.  Same contention on WPX call. STEO needs to factor in actual feet-on-the-street and take away the gov't forecasters' excel spreadsheets.

4012 2018-08-07 17:06:31 individually is the biggest con big oil has ever pulled- to make meaningful change, collective public response necessary 3/3
4013 2018-08-07 17:06:30 I saw this thread last night and I actually had a dream about going to the store to buy vitamin e oil & tea tree oil

4016 2018-08-07 17:06:21 First off, that's a George Foreman grill whether you want to admit it or not. Second, if you are doing Atkins, marinade the meat in vegetable oil and a McCormick meat seasoning packet. Place in a ziplock bag in fridge for 15 min-all day. These packets are on the staining aisle.
4017 2018-08-07 17:06:18 Inflation was 27% 1975, in part thanks to Nixon and oil shocks 1971/1973. Interest rates were lower and certainly never 20%, meaning that inflation reduced the value of people's debts. Not that the times were good. But middle classes did alright as always.
4018 2018-08-07 17:06:16 Lmao fucking Karen  but I read that pregnant women take cbd oil to help with nausea and other symptoms  idk any medicine that’s specifically safe but in the meantime for your nausea try drinking some sprite or ginger ale
4019 2018-08-07 17:06:12 This is deep
4020 2018-08-07 17:06:12 I can’t risk looking into it, just in case the diesel turns out to be... well, you know. 

Never thought I’d find myself hoping for an oil spill.
4021 2018-08-07 17:06:07 Unfortunately they don’t look at your oil when you for inspection
4022 2018-08-07 17:06:05 H/T @mtracey"'Don't like it? Start your own social media company!' is almost as ridiculous today as 'Don't like it? Start your own oil refining company!' would've been in the 1880s."

Ask @getongab how it's going for "enterprising young chaps" becoming filthy rich. Easy 4 U 2 say
4023 2018-08-07 17:05:52 it’s summer, I got my tea tree oil & my sketchbook, and it’s time to f*cking party
4024 2018-08-07 17:05:50 The Fuel Shortage Wars obviously coming about after Trump blocks world trade with oil producing countries because...uhhh...American Petroleum First?
4025 2018-08-07 17:05:50 I've always used coconut oil on feet it brilliant  . Use it all over it's so good on hair too 
4026 2018-08-07 17:05:46 Foreign policy for the sake of a few good press cycles (on both sides). This is why it’s a bad idea to elect a con man snake oil salesman.
4027 2018-08-07 17:05:45 Oh my you are funny
4028 2018-08-07 17:05:43 Is coconut oil really working
4029 2018-08-07 17:05:43 nah, he said "take oil" - like, drinking it! (But WITH your pain meds, obv)... then, uh, bathe in it, wash your hair, brush your teeth, use it as lube, bake it into pumpkin spice cupcakes, become a spokesman, profit! YAS! hippie cures!.. becoming a lawyer is too much work
4030 2018-08-07 17:05:37 Now oil $ is clean...
4031 2018-08-07 17:05:33 So he got Montana off twitter cause his boss was invested in big oil.  Now Elon taking equity injections from Saudi.  Makes sense.
4032 2018-08-07 17:05:31 Elon just tweeted to say he has funding to take Tesla private again. I was just being cheeky, as there aren’t too many out there with the $70bn it would cost. Saudi do. What a twist in the story, a fortune made from oil, used to buy Tesla?
4033 2018-08-07 17:05:27 Isn’t there a @Lucas_Oil divisional race you could go to?
4034 2018-08-07 17:05:16 So long, snake oil salesman
4035 2018-08-07 17:05:13 $TSLA up on @elonmusk tweet of going private at $420/share. Also, reports that the Saudi Arabia sovereign wealth fund has accumulated a stake of between 3%-5%. Somewhere between $1.7B and $2.9B. Even #OIL knows this is the future. #EV #tesla $tslaq #climatechange #GetInvested
4036 2018-08-07 17:05:11 #Oil price update: $74.44 #ukog have just had an enormous pump delivered today with the ability to handle 1000s of bpod the last pump tapped out at nearly 500 ? surely the penny is starting to drop here not the share price. #ukplc

4038 2018-08-07 17:05:03 For me, anything with tea tree oil works best!
4039 2018-08-07 17:05:02 exactly!  we could bring the Constitution and our economy there.  Build up their middle class.  reduce the lower class.  think of the development and infrastructure jobs we'd create.  not to mention all that oil.
4040 2018-08-07 17:04:52 No more sesame oil please—“
4041 2018-08-07 17:04:50 I don’t have RA but just a few thoughts based on experience. Turmeric: there is a user group-TUG on FB-they say it needs to be combined with both an oil and black pepper to be effective. I didn’t tolerate it well.

4043 2018-08-07 17:04:43 Best reinvention for the Saudis is to save the world from oil pollution
4044 2018-08-07 17:04:39 Output of oil is slowed to INCREASE the price Floyd, not decrease it. Called supply and demand. An interesting capitalist concept.
4045 2018-08-07 17:04:34 I should’ve gotten up earlier to go get this oil change
4046 2018-08-07 17:04:22 Yes.. I can buy another bottle of sesame oil !
4047 2018-08-07 17:04:22 Tea tree oil saves my life
4048 2018-08-07 17:04:09 To pick up on @neilayates theme, tonight's fare is barbecued chicken jerk ( home made marinade) with coconut rice and pes seved with salad and black-eyed beans Greek style ( with onions dressed with vinegar and olive oil).
4049 2018-08-07 17:04:07 He just told us that water is wasted because it flows into the Pacific.
I am sure he has a plan for stopping and storing the water that grew out of his plan for taking the oil.
If his brain was dynamite, he couldn't blow an ants nose.

4051 2018-08-07 17:04:01 It honestly depends on your hair! I have healthy hair with enough protein, so coconut oil dries my hair out and makes it brittle. If your hair is dry using a product with coconut oil, try without and see if your hair is better!

4055 2018-08-07 17:03:38 Naked and covered in oil with the women, muscly and oiled with the men. Ohh and we gotta wear yellow.
4056 2018-08-07 17:03:37 I bit trump and the big oil and thinking shit, now what! @tesla
4057 2018-08-07 17:03:35 Yes omg! When I first got my peppermint oil, I was so excited to use it so I used it without FCO and rubbed it on my temples and it was insta burn in my eyes lol
4058 2018-08-07 17:03:34 That cannabis oil CBD knocks you out, what a sleep I’ve just had 
4059 2018-08-07 17:03:32 When you hear all the shady things that went on behind the scenes, how brutally mismanaged the finances were, I think I’m being nice by saying just “snake oil”
4060 2018-08-07 17:03:27 Yeah, very concerning! Had stopped for an oil change before then and was getting scared when the wheel wouldn't really turn and a lot of dashboard lights were lit 
Then I realized...
4061 2018-08-07 17:03:17 Well, this one wasn't a coloring book, just a kids' book about how great the oil industry was, but the message was very similar.
4062 2018-08-07 17:03:01 It is a combination of both. There is radicalization in Kashmir with anti-India sentiment at all times high as well as Pakistan happy to add oil to fire. Problem is Modi government is handling both aspects badly. You no who decides Kashmir policy Amit Shah out of all.
4063 2018-08-07 17:02:54 Saudi Arabia only has friends because they buy weapons and bribe people... Your human rights are a disgrace and were moving away from oil... Maybe sand might come up with another use... Free your women! #istandwithyemen
4064 2018-08-07 17:02:48 QAnon was made up by 4channers for lulz and you got played. You need to detox yourself from this polluted and illogical mindset. Alex Jones is a snake oil salesman who has used his knowledge of propaganda tactics to trick you all into buying his BS and supplements. Also Cruz sux.

4066 2018-08-07 17:02:32 the USA didn’t have to stumble onto a solution to high oil prices; the ultimate solution was the Volcker recession which was far more painful for everyone globally than the 1973 and 1979 oil shocks combined (and 1979 was more painful than 1973)
4067 2018-08-07 17:02:26 CNN used to talk a lot of shit about @glennbeck when he did this.
4068 2018-08-07 17:02:15 Saudi, Norway both have trillion dollar funds and are looking to diversify away from oil

4071 2018-08-07 17:02:08 About Guyana in 2017-18. A snapshot of life. Before the oil. On the brink of potentially momentous and/or turbulent change. Things will never be the same again
4072 2018-08-07 17:02:01 Been waiting for my oil change now for an hour and a half  it’s not like I had other plans today anyway right?
4073 2018-08-07 17:01:49 Lol, we will be giving her some coconut oil because she hasn't had it in a long time and she loves it :3
4074 2018-08-07 17:01:44 My guess here on manufacturering jobs is same thing that is driving inflation:  Oil and drilling and more equipment.  It is worth monitoring but these issue tend to below the surface of headlines

4078 2018-08-07 17:01:35 Meta--so when you colored in the oil industry propaganda, you got dirty hands.

Oil and other gvts' meddling in iran always created pblms for iran. Regime change will not solve anythg but just adds more disorder and confusion to this mess
4101 2018-08-07 16:59:48 It's a publicity stunt & waste of our time.
How about a buck for gas or a buck for insurance or a buck for oil to heat our houses or a buck for the electricity or water or a buck a month for property taxes!
This is not an essential requirement for @fordnation to be delivering on.

4104 2018-08-07 16:59:46 Sure we will do equal housework..... if women agree to allow men to leave the sinking ship first, go to war and get themselves killed. Go drill oil in the frozen artic.

4107 2018-08-07 16:59:13 Did you know that current production from a major oil sands producer matches the carbon emissions from its US counterparts?
4108 2018-08-07 16:59:12 I was getting my oil changed this morning. CNN came on with this story. One of the guys in the waiting room starting ranting this is fake news and CNN is bent on hurting Trump. He was off the rails. I kept quiet. My dad use to say only idiots argue with idiots.
4109 2018-08-07 16:59:10 I've got a headcold and Lempsip isn't working so I've taken to snorting tea-tree oil in case it's the long lost cure to the common cold that nobody ever thought of.

4116 2018-08-07 16:58:03 Us oil doesn’t dictate oil prices. We could if we wanted to make it much cheaper here but we don’t.
4117 2018-08-07 16:58:00 I think we collectively need to stop referring to them as “free markets”. There is no such thing and no major party advocates for it. Oil and farm subsidies, the fuckin stock market, these are all forms of government sanctioned market participation
4118 2018-08-07 16:57:55 If you came close to doing your job, he'd mean you....but you all break out the massage oil for that side.
4119 2018-08-07 16:57:52 Oil constitutes about 95% of Nigeria's general revenue.
4120 2018-08-07 16:57:45 If oil switches from the US dollar standard the decline of thebUS will accelerate dramatically. It is already in a fast decline. If it doesnt keep military spending at ludicrous levels it will also end quickly.
4121 2018-08-07 16:57:43 We have refineries , we refine your oil  with it, just too busy telling you how to live instead of looking after our own best interests . Like the economic growth that comes from refining our own oil
4122 2018-08-07 16:57:41 هذه كيف نوصل لها
4123 2018-08-07 16:57:38 Russia for these: National Telecommunications and Information Administration & Office of Marine and Aviation Operations. The OIL & Gas Industry picked him for: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration & National Institute of Standards and Technology. OLIGARCHS RULE!
4124 2018-08-07 16:57:36 Yes, we are the biggest Power producers we will stay that way with or without oil.
4125 2018-08-07 16:57:33 Tapi kulit i tetap berminyak . Mungkin kulit kita sensitif dgn kandungan dlm cleansing oil ni. Mungkin juga faktor lain. Silap hari tu tak buat patch test. Nasib baik jerawat naik kat tepi tepi je 
4126 2018-08-07 16:57:33 Right!!!!! I said the same thing about BHO  in 2011-2012 when oil was almost $110 a barrel and I was paying $4 for gas. I had to sell my truck and buy a freaking car. Thanks Barry!!!!!!!

4128 2018-08-07 16:57:26 Now Iran will block the Strait of Hormuz in defiance of the sanctions..no oil will leave Saudi Arabia by their blockades..theres a possibility of war with iran..the USA and it's allies will make easy work to defeat Iran on its own turf
4129 2018-08-07 16:57:07 Coconut oil makes me so happy
4130 2018-08-07 16:56:57 “Allo dave”

What’s your take on all the oil they’re not allowed to sell because of USA sanctions?
4131 2018-08-07 16:56:51 Could be. But they’re in full hijab & burqa. Hence the assumption. I’ve tried to help them. But it’s sad to see them plead for their hungry children. It’s no use if Saudis merely flex their muscles to display their financial power, for their oil is a gift of God.
4132 2018-08-07 16:56:51 No, but hair has never been an issue for me so thankfully it just grew back in on its own.  I mainly left it alone and wore wigs. Deep condition +steam every 2 weeks. Oil scalp. Nothing fancy.
4133 2018-08-07 16:56:47 Good morning Larry, all of our oils have the stain type listed on the lab results page. Just click on the photo.  Our oil is made from full batches of complete buds. Please don't hesitate to contact us with any questions, we are always happy to help!

4135 2018-08-07 16:56:35 What the more agro part of #feminism dont realise is that for women to actually achieve #feminist goals is that they need to also have men contribute not split like water and oil! This is for men to come to terms on womens equal rights! I'm not saying women should be nicer!
4136 2018-08-07 16:56:35 Time to start producing our own oil and gas. We need our own refineries.  But soy boy @JustinTrudeau would never have the guts to do this.
4137 2018-08-07 16:56:27 The oil tank in my car has burst, an now I have to pay out £150 to get it fixed.

So in conclusion - being a car owner is no longer fun. 
4138 2018-08-07 16:56:22 By the way in 2030 only 30% of SA income will be from oil, and SA already started to transfer to solar energy.

4145 2018-08-07 16:55:32 "True ketos"?  I have a ketogenic nutritionist through my neurologist. Not once has she mentioned "keto coffee", MCT oil, exogenous ketones or any other ridiculous products. Stop preying on people new to #LCHF with "supplements" that are overpriced and not necessary.

4147 2018-08-07 16:55:25 This "Liberal" govt has made a lot of effort to convince us that we don't need oil so to be consistent, emissions should be irrelevant to economic growth. Anyway, they are crazy when it comes to economics so it doesn't matter.
4148 2018-08-07 16:55:20 I came across a similar kids book recently about the benefits of the oil industry left behind after some event at a local hotel. The illustrations looked like they were drawn on graph paper.

4150 2018-08-07 16:55:14 They need boiling in oil.
4151 2018-08-07 16:55:14 However, we must bear in mind that although inflation remains controlled, the risks are upwards due to the increase that fuels prices  may continue  presenting because of the high value of the dollar and oil.

4154 2018-08-07 16:55:01 Oil free hotey hain 
4155 2018-08-07 16:55:00 Dude. Don't worry. There is no separatist movement in Baluchistan. Only Isis threat.
And Pakistan is not an arab country which totally depends on oil. We got talent in every field. Intact revenue from oil will help us make our other economic sectors strong.
4156 2018-08-07 16:54:54 If emissions were assigned to oil companies then price per barrel would be higher and consumers would be driven off "dirty" energy sources faster. Oil really would be "too valuable to burn" to paraphrase the Shah.
4157 2018-08-07 16:54:48 @SICAxxSICA  but yet somehow the oil goin find its way to pop you through the hole
4158 2018-08-07 16:54:48 Nice idea for some but thinking cheaper gas would help many more people. Everyone use oil in everyday life.
4159 2018-08-07 16:54:40 Look at the maps from 1900...
Mesopotamia Persia Assyria have a history... Your history? Oil money and a King made by UK...
4160 2018-08-07 16:54:36 Kale and spinach are good ones. Massage Kale with oil for a better texture though. Beans and quinoa are also good salad proteins.
4161 2018-08-07 16:54:24 So how long before conservatives find oil nearby and run a leaking pipeline through here?!? How long before they open it up to logging?!?.......Oh right....This is Canada. They have a sane leader that will the environment.
4162 2018-08-07 16:54:10 I am right there with you. I wasnt 100% tired but i was more focused and calmer. My brain wasnt scattered and helps with stress and anxiety BIG TIME. !!  i think i prefer the oil  straight up tho. over the joint
4163 2018-08-07 16:54:03 Yeah they are only a couple hundred miles apart with SN 33% oil vs PVA 75%
4164 2018-08-07 16:53:59 Maybe the US will invade Canada, who knows at this point. Oil. Water. Resources. They certainly don't ACT like allies to me... They say steel/aluminium coming from Canada is a security issue. Prefer buying from Russia. WE are a security issue!
So, yeah, god knows what's next.

Take your used oil, filters, antifreeze & containers to Carman Eco Centre (located at the Carman Transfer Station) during the month of August & you will receive the opportunity to win new oil during the EcoSummer program.
(Some conditions apply.)
4166 2018-08-07 16:53:49 Two snake oil salesmen. That's a hard verdict - but maybe fair when all things are considered.  Lacklustre transfer strategy without clear vision for tactical purpose.

4169 2018-08-07 16:53:42 Will do.

4171 2018-08-07 16:53:23 if we are selling our oil so cheap .. @realDonaldTrump should be slapping tariffs on it (for #NationalSecurity reasons of course) any day now ..
4172 2018-08-07 16:53:08 SNB and MBS have figured out that the energy released from burning cash far exceeds oil, for a minimal CO2 footprint (for crypto it’s 0). It’s basically free energy. I’ll collect my Nobel later.
4173 2018-08-07 16:53:03 yeah but then the “oil interests, not economics, are the only thing stopping electric cars” narrative would break

4178 2018-08-07 16:52:49 All that’s achieved with this is just escalating the conflict. They just made a martyr out of him, gave him the biggest PR history in ages. I bet his snake oil sales are going through the roof.
4179 2018-08-07 16:52:39 All data indicate that the price of oil will fall to 55-60 dollars
4180 2018-08-07 16:52:38 Canada sells more oil to the USA than KSA does.
We will see who goes broke, won't we.

4182 2018-08-07 16:52:34 Great Q. The 8/5 deal focused on governance. The parties prev. signed deals on 6/27 (declaring a permanent ceasefire, based on the Dec 2017 CoH & "all relevant provisions of ARCSS", and discussing security of the Unity oil fields) and a 7/6 Outstanding Security Arrangements deal.

4187 2018-08-07 16:52:12 But they still own $2 billion in Tesla, which is more of the point. Ownership is power. If they bought enough of Tesla they could cripple it so they could keep selling oil at inflated prices.
4188 2018-08-07 16:52:11 And why does Saudi sell oil to a certain state who oppresses Palestinians?
4189 2018-08-07 16:52:00 You won’t find a canola plant in nature. Instead, canola oil comes from a genetically-modified form of rapeseed, designed to be resistant to pesticides and lower in erucic acid, a substance known to be harmful to humans.

4192 2018-08-07 16:51:41 KPLC should spare us tonight as we all Tune to K24 TV (9pm) where Hon. Lomenen will be interviewed on Oil Issues and Stalemate surrounding it.
4193 2018-08-07 16:51:39 The problem is that Eastern Canada can't use unrefined dilbit in place of heating oil and gasoline. If there were Canadian refineries that could handle it, we'd be glad to "buy Canadian" instead of importing. On the other hand, we'd really prefer switching to renewables.

4280 2018-08-07 16:44:02 I use real avocados with honey and olive oil & mixed it. it made it soft, less dry & you can see my curl pattern better
4281 2018-08-07 16:43:59 The Saudi Arabia of #oil, Saudi Arabia, has invested $2 billion in an electric car company. IF YOU CAN'T SEE THE FUTURE YOUR EYES ARE CLOSED, just sayin'.
4282 2018-08-07 16:43:51 15,000 scientists from around the globe on my side. How many you got? what's this "thousands"? No reputable scientist would stake his reputation and career on a lie, unless he's getting a lot of oil money. 

You wake up, I gave you factual proof, not my fault you don't read it
4283 2018-08-07 16:43:41 お強請り！！！！！！！！しろ！
4284 2018-08-07 16:43:40 Milan’s last month: Real owners with real money. Basically swapped the artist formerly known as Kalinic for Gonzalo Higuain. Leonardo replacing the two snake oil salesman and trading the gargantuan Bonucci contract for one of Europe’s best centreback prospects. Oh, and Maldini.
4285 2018-08-07 16:43:37 So nice to go to an oil change place that's drive through and they don't pull your air filter out and try to get you to replace everything

4287 2018-08-07 16:43:23 I don't know which series I read that had an explanation that involved a bile-producing organ that secreted flammable oil and lungs that produced air hot enough to ignite it when spewed.

How do you stop engine oil boiling? Apparently Pauline’s at 130 degrees. 
(Pauline is the car btw)
4294 2018-08-07 16:42:43 When the global oil price collapsed, Venezuela was not the only developing country whose chief export is oil. Howcome other nations are not in the same dire position due to the oil price, right now?

Please apply some critical thinking before responding Floyd. This is Twitter.

4305 2018-08-07 16:41:22 @TransitCustom just want to say that these ford customs are awful. Bought a 3 year old one. Needed a new dpf and now because the oil light didn’t come on a new engine
4306 2018-08-07 16:41:22 Every administration since then has worked with the community and scientists to improve the environment. Until the last few years trying to weasel out of planned improvements. Big Cypress acquisition took land out of hands of oil exploration. Deliberately.
4307 2018-08-07 16:41:20 Not so sure, because US controls almost all the monetary policy making bodies, imf et al , aside oil, there is basically nothing to benefit from the rouhani Iran, the US is the largest oil producers currently, so they have the viability to impose sanctions on them.
4308 2018-08-07 16:41:18 I picked up my coconut oil and started rubbing it in my hair and said “yummy yummy hair oil” and I can’t believe I have a job and am allowed to interact with the general public
4309 2018-08-07 16:41:16 Perhaps everyone can get their undies untwisted & realize that MBS is no damn reformer. More of the same. Saudi Arabia is the shittiest country - has poisoned all else around it, rife w/ human right/child abuse, slavery & god knows what else. Can't wait for their oil to run out
4310 2018-08-07 16:41:13 If you buy the filter and oil I could do it for free!
4311 2018-08-07 16:41:06 Oil change while she's up there?
4312 2018-08-07 16:41:02 About to tell these people "Fuck the oil change, just give me back my damn vehicle." because I have been waiting for too long now.
4313 2018-08-07 16:40:41 But @infowars is a ridiculous hill that a lot of keyboard warriors will die on.   @alexjonesshows is a fool, a charlatan, and a snake oil salesman.  Lumping him in with TDS, TRS, and the others cheapens all of us.
4314 2018-08-07 16:40:32 Hey, @elonmusk,

Does the @SierraClub and your left wing base know you're taking evil oil money from the Saudi's?

First, the @gop, and now this!

Shameful!

4322 2018-08-07 16:39:44 @realDonaldTrump reinstituted  sanctions on Iran, with the exception of oil production. Which means manufactured goods. It that really going to create a hardship for them?
4323 2018-08-07 16:39:35 There’s a lot of luxuries in life I’m really happy to afford at age, like buying full synthetic oil and not mixed.
4324 2018-08-07 16:39:32 The refineries in the east are not equipped to handle bitumen. Energy East was just another export pipeline.

Why doesn't oil from Nfld supply eastern Canada?
4325 2018-08-07 16:39:26 $TSLA-It appears Musk's short burn of the century comment was the sharing of insider information RE:  Saudia Arabia's SWF taking a monster position: (1) SA-SWF position is likely an oil hedge (2) SA-SWF has no idea what it's getting involved in (3) The purchase already occurred.

4327 2018-08-07 16:39:14 When the US stops propping up their monarchy for cheap oil and defense contracts then it’ll probably take another 10-30 years after that
4328 2018-08-07 16:39:11 Of course environmental damage of this Canadian oil is not less.
4329 2018-08-07 16:39:07 he  will with a support of oil muslim country

4331 2018-08-07 16:39:07 3 million is a pittance to that kind of guy and even to the club’s overall health. He’s not an oil baron or Russian oligarch. I’d rather have a self funding club.
4332 2018-08-07 16:39:07 Don’t feel like going to get a oil change

4346 2018-08-07 16:37:33 He's three years younger than me. I'm no oil painting but Basil Hallward used Alex Jones as a template for his Dorian Gray picture.
4347 2018-08-07 16:37:31 The Public Investment Fund is central to the Kingdom's Vision 2030 plan, which is an effort to diversify the economy away from oil; in that context, this is not very surprising.
4348 2018-08-07 16:37:22 To be fair, start up capital needed for a social media platform is substantially smaller than an oil refinery. More like "don't like it start your own website". I don't understand why this concept is so hard to you.
4349 2018-08-07 16:37:18 @realDonaldTrump  The CA wildfires are not because of over regulation, but because GLOBAL OIL in burning fossil fuels is causing more extremes in weather. Your denial of climate change is a threat to our species.
4350 2018-08-07 16:37:15 i’m tired of the coconut oil fad because companies keep putting coconut oil in their shampoo/conditioner and killing my hair

4355 2018-08-07 16:37:02 Big oil should get the hospital bills, funeral expenses for all those with asthma, lung disease and more. 
Send them bills for the crops which were ruined by extreme weather. The earthquake damage caused by weight of ocean water from melting glaciers.
Final would be death of all.

4362 2018-08-07 16:36:29 Shouldn't the idiots who think Trump is Putin's puppet be wondering why Putin wants Trump to make NATO more formidable by making member countries spend more for defense.

4389 2018-08-07 16:34:37 It is going to backfire as more countries realize that there are now many more reliable oil producers in the world and that the Saudis really don't matter much anymore.
4390 2018-08-07 16:34:36 Going after oil companies is passe. Having sex with the earth is what will do the trick now.

4396 2018-08-07 16:34:00 What exactly are we looking at here? These are BABY SUNFLOWERS!  Wright Farms in Bird City, KS grow sunflowers & cold-presses them on their farm into sunflower oil- a healthier alternative to many of your traditional cooking oils!
4397 2018-08-07 16:33:57 Probably. The same ones who get upset over serving on a presidential council or donating a small amount of money to a political party. But if the Saudis see the wisdom of renewable energy, good for them. They know the oil won't flow forever & demand will go down.

4406 2018-08-07 16:33:13 If u live in islands or tropical coconuts are real cheap. Thats a days meal right there. Coconut mix w flour sum roti or flatbread, make coconut milk for a smootie or curry or ice cream, coconut oil etc
4407 2018-08-07 16:33:12 That's funny if you imagine all 10.4 million living in their compounds. There is a few like this but but not 10 million haha and not all workers that work in oil industry!

4417 2018-08-07 16:32:52 Instead of burning oil the Saudis have moved on to burning cash. Reminds me of Zimbabwe, but just in a different context.
4418 2018-08-07 16:32:44 highly unlikely. Chelsea's oil money has gone.
4419 2018-08-07 16:32:41 social media isn't just a platform to share vacation pics & swap recipes. it's the lifeblood of many businesses & elections are won & lost on the digital battlefield. as such,1 of 2 things must happen:
1) break up big social media monopolies
2) regulate them like AT&T & big oil
4420 2018-08-07 16:32:37 So if we are going to tank their economy by putting pressure on it, what do they have to lose by tanking ours too?

Meanwhile, why not help North Korea? And Iran? We’re already putting tariffs on them. And with Iran, they can get oil cheap now.

4422 2018-08-07 16:32:27 It be taking the mechanic people TOO long to do a oil change. Why it take you 2 hours fam? Wyd?

4428 2018-08-07 16:31:45 WTF

>As for coconut oil, Dr. Sacks said, “It’s the nutritional fat du jour but it has not been proven to be healthful.” 

This is the perfect description of Soviet-Harvard top-down style of thinking about nutrition. IYI.

4430 2018-08-07 16:31:38 Aku baca2 artikel katanya emg direkomendasiin karna oil tuh diangkat pake oil karna kalo air doang jadinya ga bersih, air sama minyak ga bersatu kaann. Klo aku pake RCO bisa dibeli di botanica_treatment itu mantul parah sih gosok muka doang langsung rontok komedoku
4431 2018-08-07 16:31:36 lmfaoooooooo but the cart does he make the oil himself cause it really taste weird girl I can’t even hit it I rather withdraw lmfao
4432 2018-08-07 16:31:15 As the price of conventional oil goes up (inevitable), the gap between the two shrinks, especially if you’re using organic waste from cities

4449 2018-08-07 16:30:08 So you can’t buy ordinary red oil 
4450 2018-08-07 16:29:59 Obvious as the nose on your face. Women are now “allowed” to drive in Saudi Arabia. They want their oil money-rich husbands to buy them a Tesla.
4451 2018-08-07 16:29:45 Vitamin D and fish oil. You can often find them together in one pill, which is easier, but also better because Vitamin D is not as easy to absorb as other vitamins. Whole food magnesium pills have been proven to be beneficial. Folic acid. Beet juice tastes bad, but it’s good too.
4452 2018-08-07 16:29:38 I need an oil change to lazy to go get one 
4453 2018-08-07 16:29:34 Funny u wanna sanction every one but your Puppetmaster Putin oh and who dies raised oil prices help . Yelp  same guy
4454 2018-08-07 16:29:27 Teddy Crispskin? 100% agree. Oil and season, then unapologetically stick a half-empty beer can up his ass. Don’t open that grill for about an hour. Absolutely delightful.

4459 2018-08-07 16:28:55 Is it because it will raise the price of oil, which benefits Russia?

4466 2018-08-07 16:28:35 Odd to think that a finite resource on a finite planet might reach a plateau. /s I know that the term “peak oil” is no longer in vogue and is passé, but it is a reality which will eventually impact us. I would rather use oil and natural gas on products instead of as fuel.
4467 2018-08-07 16:28:31 So about 1 million non-financial idiots just lost any bear argument with -- you from big oil bro

6) use olive oil to smoothly slide tomatoes into the garbage.

4474 2018-08-07 16:27:47 Yes but the Saudis do not say they want to sell oil in other currencies than USD. Look if Switzerland today said it wanted  to buy oil in Euros then the US would say they develop nuclear weapons and sanctions are needed.
4475 2018-08-07 16:27:39 BIG OIL!!!
4476 2018-08-07 16:27:38 It isn't really a religion so much as it is a cult... and those who claim that it is peaceful haven't read it's doctrin... glad that we are not dependant on them for oil anymore..
4477 2018-08-07 16:27:34 I feel your pain. The 5 years I commuted from Cleveland to Shenango I felt like I spent a lot of time in the car, and in car-related establishments like oil change and tire shops.

4485 2018-08-07 16:26:36 These mfs on Instagram really tryna convince people that they’re gonna get Lil Miqueala typa clear skin by rubbing honey and coconut oil mixed with nutmeg all over ur face and leaving it on for 10 minutes
4486 2018-08-07 16:26:31 Yeah this one is hilarious. How exactly should the US have ‘taken the oil’? It’s not all neatly packed in barrels waiting to be shipped ... he’s nuts. Sounds even nuttier 4 years on.
4487 2018-08-07 16:26:30 If they chopped down all those damn trees in the Sequoias and other places and rubbed crude oil all over the land, this would have never happened. Also, those giant fans that they have all over California are fanning the flames! You are a stable genius!
4488 2018-08-07 16:26:30 America has really gone back in time. What next 1940s doctors telling you it's healthy to smoke, adding extra oil in cooking is slimming?

Damn have I been lied to?? lol I be putting hella oil in my hair 
4498 2018-08-07 16:25:45 Good gods we could apply this to all sorts of things. In the energy sector alone, we could apply it to fracking, oil spills, and nuclear disasters.
4499 2018-08-07 16:25:43 Why are we really doing this?  BC oil prices go up and that's good for Russia?

4509 2018-08-07 16:24:54 We shouldn't drill new wells, and should ramp down existing production as demand comes down, otherwise we'll depress oil prices (it's the inverse of the argument in Severin's piece). And of course, as the piece acknowledges, we need to account for local emissions.

4530 2018-08-07 16:22:48 Also note that there is large variation in total life cycle emissions from oils, so differentiating among those would yield benefits. CA's oil is some of the world's dirtiest.

4543 2018-08-07 16:21:36 Allowing smaller fires to burn would be WAY more effective from what I've read

The trees aren't the problem, the underbrush and collection of debris is what burns so quickly. Eucalyptus doesn't help either, the oil is highly flammable
4544 2018-08-07 16:21:35 Maybe ive just never paid for an oil change but damn 125$?!   Foreign problems I guess 
4545 2018-08-07 16:21:30 I wonder if you cut a deal with the Saudi's to impose sanctions so that they can boost oil production with the export decline from Iran?

4554 2018-08-07 16:20:51 It's adorable how the medias response to being outed as charlatans and snake oil salesmen on the daily is the shout "no, we're real news! We're the victims here!"
4555 2018-08-07 16:20:46 Just realized that around this time last year, Salpy and I both lost our one of our nails. Thank you nail oil

4557 2018-08-07 16:20:31 All you need to say is that you support Indigenous rights and want to see mining, oil, pipelines, green energy, etc, that respects Indigenous rights and consent.
4558 2018-08-07 16:20:19 Hate to say it, but you’re 100% right Steve. Our Governments are obsessed with money and are in bed with fracking, oil, coal and gas corporations. So I don’t see a dramatic change from many governments to tackle climate change, which is disgraceful as this planet is for all of us

4562 2018-08-07 16:20:13 As a nation, the USA has addressed many monopoly situations in the past, whether it was the steel industry, oil, or telecommunications.  I think the time has come to address the publicly-traded Big Tech firms and the monopolies they have established.  #freethinker #truth
4563 2018-08-07 16:20:12 Because this administration has no respect for lives, except their own, they are willing to trade votes or favoritism for dollars. "You want to put asbestos back into building materials? Sure, that'll cost you $X & you got it. Run a leaking oil pipeline? $X. Use dirty fuel? $X!"

4569 2018-08-07 16:19:41 I’m getting really annoyed with the service department at my dealership. This is the third time I have scheduled service with an oil change, and the only thing they have down is the oil change. Today they were supposed to recalibrate my adaptive cruise control.
4570 2018-08-07 16:19:41 I can't stand Alex Jones, he's a snake oil salesman who spreads intolerance, but I find it fascinating that after ten years of letting him slide, he suddenly gets banned from three platforms, just as he's agitating for Julian Assange's release.
4571 2018-08-07 16:19:38 Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said talks between the two leaders would not take place until penalties on oil, cars, trade, gold and other metals were lifted after Mr Trump put them into place on Monday.
4572 2018-08-07 16:19:34 Change engine oil+oil filter+air filter at workshop will be around RM190. I can get the same things from hardware at RM125 + RM20 for the labour service.

4575 2018-08-07 16:19:30 I literally hate these days. I come across so cunty but I’m just sad, want cuddles and want anything deep fried in oil
4576 2018-08-07 16:19:28 We invaded countries with oil to get rich? Odd. We have a lot of oil. Like, a lot. Google it. We were bombed by Japan because as the #1 exporter of oil in the world, we cut them off bc they were aggressors. Slaves did work in the agriculture south, not the entire USA.
4577 2018-08-07 16:19:26 Being an adult is not cool at all when you only have $11 and you’re 1,000 miles overdue on a $120 oil change

4579 2018-08-07 16:19:21 Do remember Iran had a real parliamentary democracy which the US and UK helped to topple because they were going to nationalize their own oil.. As diplomats are often instructed: The axe forgets, but the tree remembers.
Each side has its story.
4580 2018-08-07 16:19:14 Every study whether it's EW, Gann,  P&F... has some amount of fascination & mystery & that's precisely y snake oil sellers make a killing out of it, it's just a matter of how soon you realize it.
Also every study by default will have some % success, including  coin toss.
4581 2018-08-07 16:19:14 You pulled out of Iran deal so you could put sanctions on their oil, so that it can help boost Russia’s petroleum sales, because of US sanctions on Russia, #traitor, #resign
4582 2018-08-07 16:19:13 I’m buying all my oil only from Iran.
4583 2018-08-07 16:19:12 Today's energy update sees electricity prices trade higher at 5.98p or circa 13.29p full cost. Pipeline closers and higher oil prices still biting, tread carefully if renewing.

Yes Gov does have mineral right on federal land, as that is all our oil.and fracking is amazing today, energy independence baby

4606 2018-08-07 16:17:07 You know when Forbes accuses your leftist government of mismanaging a resource, it is a complement. It means somehow some of the value from the resource (oil) was extracted for the Venezuelans rather than letting only foreign companies benefit.

4608 2018-08-07 16:16:50 It might be a joke to some people but my understanding is due to poverty people couldn’t or can’t afford cooking oil and would substitute with Idobi. They hardly buy bread and also add it to samp or rice and pumpkin porridge - Nhopi. It has become normal for many to add idobi.
4609 2018-08-07 16:16:50 susah nya hmm, anyway thanks. igtkan nak beli je then pakai terus cam cream ke. bio oil okay tak? pernah try?

4611 2018-08-07 16:16:31 @realDonaldTrump pulled US out of Nuclear Treaty and imposed sanctions on Iran at Putin's request.
Oil prices were too low and now that Iran has been removed from the market prices are higher, Russia's oil reserves are paying the bills again.

4614 2018-08-07 16:15:57 The Saudis supply 15%  of the oil coming to Eastern Canada. Perhaps they can find another supplier like Alberta or Saskatchewan

4623 2018-08-07 16:15:05 Will this current Canada vs Saudi dispute finally awaken Canadians to the fact that we are paying FULL PRICE for oil brought in via ocean tanker from the Middle East when we could be paying a discount rate (with NO TANKERS) from our own country?

4684 2018-08-07 16:09:42 @AcuraBrooklyn Needed an oil change on a Saturday; came in to see Kawsar at 10:30AM; no problem; hooked me up with Jamelle; in & out in an hour#happy customer!
4685 2018-08-07 16:09:40 This has nothing to do with nuclear weapons but oil trade!
The Iranian deal was working period
This president only does things for his shadow agenda.
1.he wants to start a war
2.wants to take foucus off the investigation
3.weaken support for the United States around the world
4686 2018-08-07 16:09:38 If there really is such a thing as reincarnation, I want to return as you bath oil.
4687 2018-08-07 16:09:38 You're right it is but then again I don't care :) we hit oil the SP moves up I make my 20k and then move on
4688 2018-08-07 16:09:37 It's weird that white people are so obsessed with the color of a person's skin. As if color determines what is in a person's heart. And I spent most of my summers as a teen laying in the sun as I rubbed  a mixture of baby oil an iodine on skin to turn it ad brown as could be.
4689 2018-08-07 16:09:27 Forever calling my dad when I’m getting an oil change because the mechanics stay trying to finesse me
4690 2018-08-07 16:09:10 EPIC grape juice olive oil victorias secret perfume i live in the.
4691 2018-08-07 16:09:07 ah yeah. well to be honest they never told the truth about why we dont attend to euro but we are all aware of it. 

BTW oil wrestling is not actually our national sport but i agree its gay. haha but told tell that in Turkey you may get kicked. I did in the past. Thats how I know.
4692 2018-08-07 16:09:06 Does anyone else get extreme anxiety over getting an oil change or is that just me?
4693 2018-08-07 16:08:52 this is what i get for putting off my oil change til the last minute 
4694 2018-08-07 16:08:51 I think we have bigger fish to fry  than this issue (cept there will be no oil and no batter)
4695 2018-08-07 16:08:47 Yeah I mainly use mine for headaches. When I feel one coming on I rub some on the back of my neck, shoulders and my temples with fractionated coconut oil. And cup my hands and inhale it as well
4696 2018-08-07 16:08:44 Palestinian olive oil is, hands down, the best I’ve ever tried!
4697 2018-08-07 16:08:38 Very Bullish on Brent and OIL plays, $Chke, $Jone, $Cei $Gbr and the right entry points. Russia can only increase 250k PD by EOY, Iran will fall of Nearly 1.5m by November. Meeting between Trump and Putin was about Iran and oil production, read between the lines....

4700 2018-08-07 16:08:12 Appreciate few people care about actual facts but it was Trump`s US that broke the deal with Iran.
Venezuela and Iran with rivers of oil but apparently that isnt why US are instigating regime change. Its never had any negatives in the past

4710 2018-08-07 16:07:14 It was great back then! 3 day week, nylon sheets, Angel Delight, asbestos, inflation. I still remember my parents’ oil lamps for the power cuts. Can’t wait for it all over again.
4711 2018-08-07 16:07:09 Not sure where I heard this but I think peppermint oil repels them. You may be able to find it in a spray form for easy application.
4712 2018-08-07 16:07:04 To buy that juicy spicy oil dripping catfish suya and boiled potatoes Or go home and eat pineapples?
4713 2018-08-07 16:07:03 I carry daily. Just last month we had a lady brutally raped while using the bathroom in a large car dealership she was having an oil change done in. These street people attack and destroy as they go. I won’t be that victim. I just won’t. Sad but reality.
4714 2018-08-07 16:06:58 Why not bring Bush in the conversation and his war on oil
4715 2018-08-07 16:06:58 Did #SaudiArabia really cut #crudeoil production last month? Saudis say they did, contrary to some independent estimates. Also debate over Saudi claim: supply>production (sold barrels from storage). @UrsaSpace we monitor global oil storage weekly using #satellite technology
4716 2018-08-07 16:06:54 Yes as long as it’s olive oil  most shops make  with rapeseed oil...

4722 2018-08-07 16:06:41 Is free market libertarianism inimical with practical access to civil rights? Yes.

Should out-and-out lies and a ceaseless, broad spectrum campaign of intimidation against your ideological opponents, as an advertisement to sell snake oil pills, be protected as a civil right? No.

4732 2018-08-07 16:05:43 Seems like Trudeau has created conflict to distract public - now he need to build a pipeline cause Billions of litres of their oil won’t be available to Canadians. @JamieMauracher
4733 2018-08-07 16:05:42 Call me what you like, but you still haven't answered the questions on: the deficit, currency, debt, EU membership, dwindling oil revenues, high taxation and all the other stuff you look to Business for Scotland and Wings over Bathgate to answer for you, zoomer!
4734 2018-08-07 16:05:22 Don’t worry about your clothing, it’s only in fire retardant clothing used for refineries and working oil rigs, fire fighters etc....
4735 2018-08-07 16:05:20 EIA sees the oil market undersupplied by 0.28mbpd in 2018 (-0.04 previously) and oversupplied by 0.28mbpd in 2019 (+0.64 previously) - #OOTT
4736 2018-08-07 16:05:17 has anyone deep fried an egg? like just fucking cracked an egg into hot oil and see what happens
4737 2018-08-07 16:05:14 But he is telling the truth, presidency has virtually no knowledge of anything. From oil to finance, to infrastructure, to meaning governance. Bottom line, they have zero knowledge combined. Lack ideas and innovations and refused to surround themselves with people who do. Vexed
4738 2018-08-07 16:05:13 Thats the issue....most noobs dont have the skills/experience/knowledge to smell BS.
Plenty of ppl out there to help out, just not snake oil salesmen like ICT.

4748 2018-08-07 16:04:18 You don't like what the company is doing? Stop giving them money, stop encouraging that sort of behavior. You manage to convince enough people to do that and companies will cave. But you're battling peer pressure to own a premium advertised phone, style, marketing and so on..
4749 2018-08-07 16:04:17 Meantime Butts & Trudeau are willing to send billions to mid-east despots and spill Canadian blood in Mali or elsewhere for a vote from them in the corrupt UN. For political reasons they cancelled Canadian pipeline projects that would have freed us from SA oil imports

4767 2018-08-07 16:02:17 I pulled heads before I tweeted they look good. I think it is just the case gasket.  I might have jumped the gun on thinking it was all coming from the pcv.  I wrapped a rag around the valve and it was still dumping oil from the back somewhere. I'm dumb, but thanks twitter
4768 2018-08-07 16:02:16 There’s a new documentary out with Jack Johnson that I just saw.  Even more eye opening. I do all the things you listed; and spend my time educating folks on this stuff.  I don’t think people get the oil / plastic connection either

When I ask a Vegan to describe their preferred approach to brassica production and they waffle, I know that they know sod all about ethics and food
4773 2018-08-07 16:01:49 My long-standing pet theory is that 2016 was a Hail Mary attempt by the forces of incumbent fossil fuel producers (Russian and UAE included, but also multinationals) to secure demand for their future oil production by derailing renewable/battery/efficiency projects.
4774 2018-08-07 16:01:47 It would be convenient if opinions were enough to make change but that's not how it works. Takes much more effort and time to do cohesive research and boycott your fav company until they get it straight that you won't take that shit. People are too lazy to commit.

4812 2018-08-07 15:58:25 It’s so hot my oil paints are melty after six minutes outside
4813 2018-08-07 15:58:22 Aku pake coconut oil sumpahh bagus banget.
4814 2018-08-07 15:57:58 All I need is an oil change and every place in san tan is booked already like why
4815 2018-08-07 15:57:56 Do you use it as a vinegar substitute or just add some to the oil and vinegar?
4816 2018-08-07 15:57:50 If you paying more than $25 for an oil change you getting waxed 
4817 2018-08-07 15:57:40 @tedcruz Mr Cruz get a fucking clue. this Alex Jones spreads lies for profit or he's a bought & paid for puppet much like you by the oil companies. So keep your mouth shut as this isn't your watch or per the elders design & a couple more we'll be taken down before it's over. AFF
4818 2018-08-07 15:57:33 I wonder what the political calculus is for oil and gas revenues vs wildfire expenditures? #wildfires #bcpoli #cdnpoli
4819 2018-08-07 15:57:30 They reported that before Saraki crossed the carpet, Buhari offered him an oil well and an automatic ticket in 2023 to run for presidency (I don't know how this would have worked out) and Saraki turned him down.

If that was true, that's something really out of this world.
4820 2018-08-07 15:57:28 Once your oil is no longer needed, your country will return to the complete desert it once was.
4821 2018-08-07 15:57:20 It’s made out of coconut oil isn’t it?
4822 2018-08-07 15:57:20 I bought Car Engine Oil.
4823 2018-08-07 15:57:10 Hi piers welcome back , I appreciate you’re and extremely busy man but was wondering if you could give me some advice on a new business me and my father have started . We are in the CBD  business ( cannabinoid oil ) and struggle to catch people’s attention
4824 2018-08-07 15:57:00 You’re mentally ill- I cant in good conscience have a battle of wits with an unarmed personyou’ve had nothing of your own to say that is valid and no defense for your views-you’re a sad pathetic soul and I pity you greatly. I’ll pray for you.

4826 2018-08-07 15:56:49 Oil wars. Thank the families. You can’t thank the dead
4827 2018-08-07 15:56:44 A lot of oil companies buy parts from China. Now they are starting to buy parts from US which is what they should've been doing in the first place. Because of tariffs. A big plus for US industry.
4828 2018-08-07 15:56:44 I smell like coconut oil and weed rn
4829 2018-08-07 15:56:34 Only thing (almost) I know about myrtle is you can make a wonderful etheric oil out of it! I have a tea candle holder made of stone with a small bowl over the candle. A few drops of myrtle oil in the bowl, light the candle - and your house smells deliciously exotic in few secs!

4833 2018-08-07 15:55:38 Sir, the write up is comprehensive about 'String of pearls'. It also takes note of other somewhat less talked about PRC projects such as Coco Islands, which is great.

I suspect there will ever be oil pipelines from Gwadar to anywhere in China due to geographical & tech reasons.
4834 2018-08-07 15:55:33 no i mean it in the way like the chicken is his wife whomst provides with eggs, it would be like calling a cow a milk wife, or an oil rig an oil wife

4836 2018-08-07 15:55:29 Don’t worry just use red oil
4837 2018-08-07 15:55:23 Well, in your analogy, the current outrage is that they aren't being fair to the oil.
4838 2018-08-07 15:55:20 I think I am going to give Heavy Body Acrylics a try, I struggle a lot when I use Fluid Acrylics but I am still scared to try oil paints. Heh hehh hh..
4839 2018-08-07 15:55:15 It’s also good to keep a bottle of body oil in the shower; once the water is off, rub it over your still-damp arms and legs, pat dry and you’re good to go—with amazingly smooth skin. #TipTuesday

4841 2018-08-07 15:55:13 He’s doing this for the same reason he’s dropped fuel efficiency standards. It makes his Johns (big oil executives in this case) more $$$. So millions of Iranians suffer and the hardliners have incentive to proliferate nuclear weapons- big oil gets a big win, that’s what matters.
4842 2018-08-07 15:54:59 if you ask russians - they also angry that country in famous "oil curse", bigger than USA by area cannot make even furniture, from this point of view the KGB in Russia are pure evil, this model suits them well & they afraid of independent local capital, they almost restored USSR.
4843 2018-08-07 15:54:39 Yeah same here. I'm out here in the Permian Basin Oil Fields of West Texas almost working hard, but banking some serious cash, and doing my part to #MAGA
4844 2018-08-07 15:54:35 Wahabism is a Stone Age torture. It has NO space in the modern world. Keep the fighting don’t buy Saudi (I know they have only oil to sell; can’t built anything there)
4845 2018-08-07 15:54:28 Made a Salmon/Tuna Salad yesterday w/ Greek Yogurt + Chopped Carrots and Onions + A Greek Vinaigrette blended w/ Avocado Oil. Seasoned it w/ a pinch of Sea Salt & Cayenne Pepper. Next time: I WON'T use Canned Salmon, but Salmon Fillets, saute' the Salmon & chop it up from there.
4846 2018-08-07 15:54:27 Love Oil とは・・・？
4847 2018-08-07 15:54:08 Digging oil forever right? Enough money to don’t give a fuck about anything right?
4848 2018-08-07 15:54:01 I'm not to familiar with PTSD but I heard maybe meditation might help, there's a ton of apps online that can guide you. I'd also recommend CBD oil but that can get pricey fast.
4849 2018-08-07 15:53:59 So no evidence, but it seems you concede that plant fats are 'as sustainable'. 
As I said before palm oil is not limited to vegans and many avoid it. 
I'm sure you are aware that much deforestation is due to animal agriculture, not the small percentage of vegans ( 0.5% )
4850 2018-08-07 15:53:50 Just using coconut oil as lotion improved my skin tremendously this summer
4851 2018-08-07 15:53:47 True. I can't drill for oil or work at Amazon. I just buy the stock & let them work for me.
4852 2018-08-07 15:53:43 Bingo! The man is a menace masquerading as a poster child for protection of First Amendment freedoms when he is, in reality, a snake oil salesman who uses hurtful, harmful, and hare-brained conspiracy theories for personal profit at the expense of innocent people.
4853 2018-08-07 15:53:40 No. It isn't designed for beards.

4854 2018-08-07 15:53:36 Norway (the state) owns oil in North Sea. As such profits from the oil are invested in the name of the people. Each citizen of Norway is worth more that $1 Million as a result.
4855 2018-08-07 15:53:34 Why does "add oil" make so much sense though??? XD
4856 2018-08-07 15:53:33 Oil and air training????

4859 2018-08-07 15:53:11 Easy mistake holly they have oil rigs in the seas so they need fire men on Standby 
4860 2018-08-07 15:53:05 It's mostly palm oil. Tropical deforestation in a jar.
4861 2018-08-07 15:53:01 #Venezuela: Oil rig count in Venezuela rose for the first time this year to 27 (+1 m/m) in July, rebounding from a 15-year low, Baker Hughes data show.

Iran likely to cause extreme disruptions in the world or oil supplies. If you were them would you blame yourself.

4868 2018-08-07 15:52:35 Almost, but he will be inviting Putin here to connect him to Exon so he can get his oil out of the ground affordably from Russia now that Iran can’t deal. This is the money trail folks!

4883 2018-08-07 15:51:29 As a nation, we condemn the imprisonment of family members of Saudi dissenters. Sentences of 1,000 lashes and 10 years in jail for “insulting Islam” is something out of 6th century. 
Face it, if your oil ran out today - your nation would be back to herding goats in a generation.

4889 2018-08-07 15:51:02 Lol of course politician will lower beer to a buck  but can't do anything about gas prices?

4891 2018-08-07 15:50:59 Any word from any of the other leaders yet? Has Trudeau axed the arms deal with them as a result? Or decided Eastern Canada needs to stop importing their oil and support Canada by purchasing its own?

4896 2018-08-07 15:50:08 Don’t forget China they have huge oil and gas imports from Iran. trump just shutting US off from world. Much winning, super smart. Apple phones are made in China so no iPhones. Really!
4897 2018-08-07 15:50:01 Won't deny "some of my best friends sell..." I don't have any particular experience w essential oils (or Lularoe or any of those other groups.)  If u make $ @ it, cool.

In case you haven't connected the dots... Putin controls the largest oil company in Russia. He made a 500 Billion dollar deal with the CEO of Exxon Mobil.

4908 2018-08-07 15:49:23 We are taken for fools too readily by corporations whom wish to serve stakeholders only. So it is hard to believe in large corps being altruistic or using good ecological practise just because they say they aim to do so. Processed palm oil is unhealthy to eat anyway.

4925 2018-08-07 15:47:57  we don’t have the kind of oil that can compete with there’s. Not without destroying the whole environment, and building out special facilities to do so.
4926 2018-08-07 15:47:55 Circa 1953 when we toppled their democratic government in order to gain access to their oil fields. An act they never forgave us for. Careful what you ask for.
4927 2018-08-07 15:47:48 In other news Saudi Arabia just basically threatened Canada with a 9/11-style attack over a twitter feud about human rights concerns. The Saudi's are still one of our closest allies because we rely on them for oil.
4928 2018-08-07 15:47:44 Today, tonight, Donald Trump, bribed by billions of Persian #Gulf Arab oil money and egged on by Israel’s extremist #Likud & its omnipotent American lobby, will start an economic war on the people of #Iran. Under the phony guise of helping them....

4933 2018-08-07 15:47:15 Sure, thanks to your unforgettable Margaret Thatcher (wasn't alone on that, I give her that)
But by the time, oil extraction was prosperous. Now it's heading toward its end.
4934 2018-08-07 15:47:15 The east would take all the Alberta oil we can get, but the refinery here isn't set up to process it.... but if the pipeline was built it may spark some refinery conversion or expansion

4936 2018-08-07 15:47:10 Maybe Canada should stop buying those 87,000 barrels of oil a day from Saudi and buy it from #Alberta and #Saskatchewan ..,what a novel idea.
4937 2018-08-07 15:47:10 @KeepCanWorking Join the thousands of Canadians not working and refuse to allow our government sending our natural product, oil, outside Canada for processing. Do it here and do it for a long time. That creates jobs and improves life inside Canada.
4938 2018-08-07 15:47:05 She would have been so much better at this had she watched that episode of the Americans where Elizabeth and Claudia teach young Paige to coat her stomach with olive oil before drinking.  For shame.
4939 2018-08-07 15:47:00 Those with much to lose seem to know that to maintain our currency hegemony (from which all our economic leverage stems), we must protect the free flow of commodities like oil and markets priced by the dollar.  We have to secure global shipping lanes, pipelines, etc.

4943 2018-08-07 15:46:40 gas pipeline is very old story - first such project with USSR in 1970's saved the communism for some years, but not fully (the famous oil price drop to $10 beats it), Russia esp. Putin's one are not manufacturing anything, his regime are getting money only from oil/gas export.

4946 2018-08-07 15:46:03 We must all buy Tesla Electric cars! This will shake them to the core. With no more oil money they can’t finace world wide terror or cause War for Oil!
4947 2018-08-07 15:46:03 coconut oil works very well on my skin  im lovin it
4948 2018-08-07 15:45:54 This is a function of capitalism since ever, like the looting of the global south to pay for England's health care and America's oil.
4949 2018-08-07 15:45:53 Ya okay I’m spider proofing my house so let me know how that peppermint oil works 
4950 2018-08-07 15:45:46 Why so cheap, they produce oil?
4951 2018-08-07 15:45:38 The plane with the gear symbol and of course the oil drums :o
4952 2018-08-07 15:45:30 This fool looked at jar of coconut oil and said is this food or bath salts?  was dead serious too.. clearly the jar says coconut oil 
4953 2018-08-07 15:45:14 The Middle East, except Israel, is made up of shithole countries. Do not buy oil from those countries and do not send them any free cash.

4968 2018-08-07 15:43:33 i swear to oil slicked rihanna tiddies that my parents are like my children. they were getting ready to head out for the day and the amount of times either one called out my name and asked me to help them do something,,, y'all this is why i don't want kids lmao i already got them
4969 2018-08-07 15:43:29 If your truthful you don't need PR.. unless your peddling snake oil.
4970 2018-08-07 15:43:29 That would be clean energy.  Russia's economy is based on oil.  Go green and clean!
4971 2018-08-07 15:43:26 I consider myself a right wing Canadian. I would be happy to cut ties with the backwards Saudis. I would be especially happy to stop buying oil from them and using our oil. I also think we should not send one penny more to the Palestinians, who fund terrorists.
4972 2018-08-07 15:43:17 Now playing I Need Your Oil by E. Dewey Smith, Jr. & The House of Hope Atlanta!
4973 2018-08-07 15:43:15 That's nice. But nowhere does it say, unequivocally, that you do not use palm oil from deforestation sources. It says what you strive or aim to achieve. Not what you are actually doing. And, until that happens, I will just assume it is corporate word-play.
4974 2018-08-07 15:43:10 you can tell im a masochist because i enjoy putting straight tea tree oil on my face without diluting it
4975 2018-08-07 15:43:00 An idea that will revolutionize the peanut butter industry (or at least my lunch): package natural peanut butter in jars with at least one inch of extra space at the top to allow the product to be stirred without leaving the countertop covered in peanut oil.
4976 2018-08-07 15:42:55 Gross. Nutella is LITERALLY causing orangutans to go extinct because of palm oil plantations. Please do not promote and support this!
4977 2018-08-07 15:42:55 Man I’m waiting on this oil change I’m about to fall asleep in their chair! It’s so comfy!
4978 2018-08-07 15:42:52 Lol to all my naturalista’s out there the first step to healthy hair is finding the best oil for your hair type! 

Please don’t think that black castor oil is the best oil for all hair. It’s not. Neither is coconut oil. 

1. Find out your porosity 
2. Find an oil accordingly
4979 2018-08-07 15:42:43 If it is really shale oil. there is new technology which heat it inside their shale or still in ground and then extract. it cost less and less pollution.

4981 2018-08-07 15:42:13 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
4982 2018-08-07 15:42:13 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
4983 2018-08-07 15:42:13 Seriously, as I’m playing Gone Home I’m constantly like “dammit, why don’t my conservative homophobic parents have ANY whale oil? My sister’s creepy red room doesn’t even have any Outsider relics!”
4984 2018-08-07 15:42:09 Research has shown that sniffing peppermint oil revs your brain up before working out and it at least works for me.
4985 2018-08-07 15:42:04 Mix coconut oil and lavender oil together and rub it on his feet and chest! I did that with my baby at 1 1/2 months when she was super gassy and she slept all night!

4990 2018-08-07 15:41:51 I hope they don’t take forever to change my oil 
4991 2018-08-07 15:41:37 If Reham Khan stoops any lower she will discover oil reserves.
4992 2018-08-07 15:41:25 Imagine if all oil selling countries decided to take only gold in exchange for their oil!? 
Imagine if they said no to the US Dollar. 

Boom!!
4993 2018-08-07 15:41:16 Guyanese people better RISE UP! Don't let foreigners come an steal your oil, look what happened to the Middle East
4994 2018-08-07 15:41:14 Smells good! Like my old school’s floor (linoleum is made with linseed oil too)
4995 2018-08-07 15:41:13 Been using CBD oil for a few years. It helps with my PTSD and arthritis.
4996 2018-08-07 15:40:57 Let me go get this oil change & tires . For I be shit out of luck .
4997 2018-08-07 15:40:52 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
4998 2018-08-07 15:40:49 Iran's been under sanctions matching in circles chanting death to one entity or another since 1979

Exactly what's different? 

They've always found someone to barter with to meet basic needs

Bolton unfamiliar in Islam history. Trump's sanctions are increasing oil & gas prices

5005 2018-08-07 15:40:14 Funny, you'd think most conservatives would rejoice at the prospect of using our own oil over the Saudis.

5019 2018-08-07 15:38:57 @GMA puleeeeze, white rice in burritos?! Red cabbage in burritos?! Vinegar in pico de gallo?! Olive oil in guacamole?! Ugh! Disgusting!
Millions of Mexicans you could ask how to make Mexican food, Cal-Mex, Tex-Mex, New Mexico-Mex, but noooooo, you colonize & assimilate our food.

5021 2018-08-07 15:38:48 They are doing all they can to deregulate EPA restrictions for BIG OIL & Corporations. A YUGE thing we can all donis DIVEST from Big banks. Go w/local ir credit unions. Big banks fund these horrible deals w/out our knowledge that our $ is being used for their evil.
5022 2018-08-07 15:38:47 If you follow the law and come legally- you become naturalized and are legally a citizen- if you come illegally you are breaking the law & are a criminal- like if I come to your house broke in, and say I live here now- I’d be breaking the law- same concept- just as a country!!

5024 2018-08-07 15:38:42 Saudi Arabia a barbaric, repressive, authoritarian regime. The day the world no longer kowtows to them for oil, they will go back to what they’ve been best at for thousands of years...namely herding livestock.
You can cover a pig in gold, but it’s still a pig.
5025 2018-08-07 15:38:39 Omar El- Bashir just wants South Sudan oil income, especially since the lifting of U.S. sanctions didn’t spur the economy.

Oil tankers seem to be A-OK though.
5029 2018-08-07 15:38:27 Yemen Oil still flows though
5030 2018-08-07 15:38:09 They also sit on one of the largest oil reserves in the world, and has the backing of a country's GDP. I'd say that helps.
5031 2018-08-07 15:38:06 Everyone in the world is entitled to free oil from the Middle East for reparations from terrorism. Because I said so.
5032 2018-08-07 15:38:02 Market update: price increase.

A relatively small increase compared to recent days. The most recent underlying prices show that Gas Oil has increased by 0.20PPL.
5033 2018-08-07 15:37:52 Aim of NK is to ensure uninterrupted supply of oil from Iran for a start. Collaboration in exchange of nuclear technology cannot be ruled out. Their engagement has tacit support of Russia &China. If things don't progress in Korean peninsula, it's a  shape of a new world order
5034 2018-08-07 15:37:49 I believe Liberal mouthpiece @CBCNews called Saudi oil...."mineral products"
5035 2018-08-07 15:37:47 Nothing more attractive than hearing your man change gears and shoot premium motor oil.
5036 2018-08-07 15:37:46 If we can run oil lines form Canada to the states, why cant we run a water line to most of these areas susceptible to fires?
5037 2018-08-07 15:37:42 I’m tired of paying $100 for an oil change 
5038 2018-08-07 15:37:35 I recommend having a cleansing ritual that includes saging your space as well as sprinkling the peace oil as it’s very powerful, energy wise. Sage an area, then sprinkle the oil, then move onto the next area. Focus on corners. And always use your guides to lean on..
5039 2018-08-07 15:37:35 @PeterSchiff what’s a decent oil index fund to invest in?

5042 2018-08-07 15:37:27 You said perfume. I stick with Eqyptian Goddess perfume oil from Rockin Rudy’s. Just one daub. [Much mellower on than the aroma out of bottle. ]
5043 2018-08-07 15:37:15 Market update: price increase.

5044 2018-08-07 15:37:10 His hair creeps me out for starters...imagine running your fingers through a bowl of olive oil...ewwwww! But that smile, is it a dopey smile, a wicked smile? More likely a smile with him thinking how far superior he to you because “I’m a Trump”. NAUSEATING
5045 2018-08-07 15:37:02 Have you noticed under GOP governance most of us make less, work longer, sicker & for every tax break we pay out of our pockets 50 for every $ they give back. GOP are cons Snake Oil Inc will use anything to rip you off but it's most of their base they screw the most.

He worries me. Big ambition back then was to carry Iraq over to Iran.
Trump is rattling same swords.
Of course, it's about OIL.   $$$$ for officials. 
Not about safety of US military or people.

5057 2018-08-07 15:35:40 If you believe that the worldwide supply of oil is infinite and that extracting and burning it causes no adverse environmental impacts, then you might find some things in this article with which you agree.
5058 2018-08-07 15:35:21 Nothing beats My mom's pureed rice.  Ingredients: olive oil, and grated parmesan cheese.
5059 2018-08-07 15:35:16 If you cross the border ILLEGALLY you are breaking the LAW- it is a crime- if you do it and commit more crimes that is really bad. Maybe if I break it down like I would for a 2 yr. old you’ll understand immigration & how it works- probably not though

5065 2018-08-07 15:34:33 They use it as an excuse to get rid of them ,Liars !
 Its the constant grazing by livestock, mining and fracking for oil that completely destroy the public land & water.  I'm afraid the only way the horses & burros can b saved is to have huge protected ,well funded sanctuaries .
5066 2018-08-07 15:34:19 I think maybe that's too simplistic an answer. I think our governments are looking for easy fixes to complex problems.  Alberta was a have-not province fairly recently.  It doesn't want to go back to ranching, but without oil, what does it have?
5067 2018-08-07 15:34:15 Alex Jones and those like him are just the modern world's version of Snake oil Salesmen. They are selling Hate, Lies, and Conspiracy theories, to fools and making millions in the process.
5068 2018-08-07 15:34:08 "McTeague...says govt attempts to control prices are misguided efforts that ignore the root of the problem: a weak CDN$ dragged down by ironically low prices for CDN crude oil, and increasingly slim operating margins for gasoline and diesel distributors" #onpoli @financialpost
5069 2018-08-07 15:34:02 Govt, @TullowOilplc and Turkana leaders agree on a two tier committees to address grievances. This is to pave way for resumption of operation in the oil fields and trucking of crude oil. cc @citizentvkenya @patrickigunzah #CitizenBusiness

5072 2018-08-07 15:33:30 The truth is evident. Trump blunders constantly on twitter , implicating himself and his sin in collusion. They promised removal of sanctions and a Rosneft  oil deal ( tillerson was supposed to complete ) in exchange for dirt on Clinton to derail her. Trump is corrupt.
5073 2018-08-07 15:33:29 It says we don’t want ppl to break the law or criminals 2 come 2 our country illegally-we don’t want ppl to traffic children,sell drugs, ect. And we have a 0 tolerance policy for that-what do you think you are proving?That you are not just delusional-but, are batsh*t crazy?

5085 2018-08-07 15:32:00 Do I want ethical oil. Yes! Do I want Canadian oil over imported oil ? All the way! This is not what this is about. Instead of the Liberal government accepting responsibilty for creating this mess they are diverting and changing the issue to oil. Saudis know its not about oil.

5091 2018-08-07 15:31:17 Trump bellicose announcements with Iran, North Korea, Syria is all about getting the crude oil price up. If Iran can't trade oil at the next sanction it almost guarantees war.
5092 2018-08-07 15:31:08 World peace?  LOL!  Willing to start a war so your oil company buddies can get rich off of raised oil prices. That’s the opposite of world peace. Look it up!

5105 2018-08-07 15:30:08 It seems to me that personal data is NOT the new oil. The way it is being abused, it is much more like the new child labour. #privacy protection and regulations are required to prevent abuse and set a floor for real competition in the attention economy. @JLINCLabs has a solution.

5113 2018-08-07 15:29:49 I've found that peppermint oil lotion really helps with topical treatment of joint pain, but it's not a lasting treatment. I'm not having much luck with plaquenil or methotrexate-they've helped minimally but not enough, same with celebrex. Humira is the next step

5120 2018-08-07 15:29:12 Fields sit fallow for a reason! Certain crops take a lot out of the soil hence the need for fallow fields and crop rotation! Oil seed rape particularly greedy! But the oil it produces will be necessary as we don't have olives or !
5121 2018-08-07 15:29:03  Can’t believe people who say it’s a money making scam.. went the docs, said I feel a bit anxious & they tried to give me anti depressants .. that’s the real scam!  CBD oil is hands down the best thing I’ve ever used!
5122 2018-08-07 15:29:01 This oil change was damn near quick
5123 2018-08-07 15:28:58 Please compare the international market prices also.
At 2016 crude oil was 42 $/barrell and now 69 $/barrel.
Don't throw the tweets without investigation.

5125 2018-08-07 15:28:48 Curious I think we should be using our own oil too and putting more money into our own energy sector.  Trudeau and his lying Liberals won’t do it though

5139 2018-08-07 15:27:11 and stop buying their oil... sell them the APCs but dont give them a dime for oil ever again.
5140 2018-08-07 15:27:02 I usually love it when you put it in the fryong pan and cook it with a little bit of oil its sooo good. And baked are good too because all those while fish oil comes out and MMMM I LOVE that part!!

5142 2018-08-07 15:26:55 Curcumin turmeric is the big one. I just added St. John’s Wort. Otherwise, it’s stuff like fish oil, chromium, calcium, magnesium, etc. I’ve found that if I neglect my physical health, my mental health suffers, because being unable to do anything due to fatigue, back pain, etc.
5143 2018-08-07 15:26:54 Certainly as sustainable as every plant fat and more sustainable than palm oil and others grown in an intensive, often deforesting way.
5144 2018-08-07 15:26:45 In 50 years or more that’ll happen. Oil is king unfortunately
5145 2018-08-07 15:26:18 With these Iran sanctions by the US crude oil will go up and wonder how much we'll be paying for petrol the end of the year 
5146 2018-08-07 15:26:18 And some of the dirtiest oil in North America! Where are those protesters?
5147 2018-08-07 15:26:17 In essence it’s a very healthy style of eating. You can however still put weight on if you ate too much (olive oil is easy to indulge on as is feta cheese!).  But all good types of fat, had a great one with tuna today 
5148 2018-08-07 15:26:15 if the US targets a country for decades , it will eventually become a failed state. It has targeted Venezuela for decades because the USA can not have a country with so much oil in its part of the world that is not subservient to it.
5149 2018-08-07 15:26:07 Working in the oil industry, I’ve had lots of friends working in the Middle East, all of them said they were treated well, living in their compounds, but each one also expressed their concern over how migrant workers were treated

5153 2018-08-07 15:25:57 The solution would be to change the legislation that doesn't allow for another refinery and build one that we can use to refine our own oil. #nlpoli

5156 2018-08-07 15:25:22 I totally agree but the squeaky wheel always gets the oil. Perhaps all of us good ones should become a lot more squeaky.

Thief 2: This tweet is dumb.

5160 2018-08-07 15:24:59 It does mention the oil grade too tho (see picture #3)
I guess the cost of refining heavy crude / bitumen would be much higher so its cheaper to ship it to places with lower environmental regulations..

5199 2018-08-07 15:21:22 Very well said. It certainly does, Scotland has built up a lot of business and knowledge regarding oil extraction, but I believe they are well behind Norway in this regard. And would say UK government is partly at fault for that.
5200 2018-08-07 15:21:18 Tight govt control doesn't make it socialist when it's still based on capitalist economic structures and systems.  Even if there was 0% private economy, if the state engages in capitalist economics, it's still capitalist. State-owned oil co. still acts as a capitalist biz.

Not even close to the same level of wrong but Oil companies are a business, it's not ok for them to cast doubt about global warming bc its correct for max profits.

5212 2018-08-07 15:20:53 Unless the state bans what you say then it is not a free speech issue. There has never been a better time to be a racist with a megaphone. The "free speech" debate is just another flavour of snake oil which speaks to people who feel afraid, but it offers them no solutions.
5213 2018-08-07 15:20:46 Soooo... with 95% of their income derived from oil, tell me again how sanctions aren't to blame?

Fuck ton (1 cup) Olive oil, 
1 tsp paprika, 
Juice of 5 lemons,
8 chicken breasts, 
4 tbsp of oregano. 
Salt'n'Pepper, Push it.
If you leave it marinating overnight it will be explosive. The chicken was a mad blaze on the BBQ! 
Time for a fag.

5223 2018-08-07 15:19:48 at this point i feel like i have every variation of coconut liquid in my apartment; coconut oil, coconut milk, coconut cream, and soon i have to buy coconut butter
5224 2018-08-07 15:19:45 We should stop giving them money purchasing oil, use our own oil BUT keep taking their money for APCs.  That would be the smart move here... instead we cut off income and continue to buy their oil- we are stupid. (in Ottawa) @manny_ottawa
5225 2018-08-07 15:19:30 Don’t overlook the fact that trump has destabilized the Middle East to the point that GAS PRICES ARE ON THE RISE!  If trump makes it impossible to buy oil from Iran, there’s always....RUSSIA!
5226 2018-08-07 15:19:30 Really?  Remind me who owns the oil companies?  Oh yes, foreign corporations.  So, do you plan to nationalise it and if so, where will the money come from

5229 2018-08-07 15:19:12 Lol the fact that you dream up this fantasy there is significant private sector economic activity, when its common knowledge that 95 % of Venezuela's foreign currency income is derived from oil sales from a gov't monopoly, shows you are either ignorant, or stupid.

5231 2018-08-07 15:19:07 @CFRASnow I would support a total ban from importing oil from Saudi Arabia.  We need to build the pipeline.   It wouldn't surprise me if the Saudis were sponsors of those protesting the Energy East pipeline.
5232 2018-08-07 15:19:06 We could elect a fascist government but we could also dismantle multi-national oil conglomerates and transition to a fossil fuel-free economy complete with across-the-board support for electric vehicles and rail but idk all the parties suck right :/

5250 2018-08-07 15:17:54 But what if the exact person you wanted didn't notice you? Do you think you should just give up on what you want or could you expand into the roll that they are looking for.

5255 2018-08-07 15:17:27 Oil is likely to push up while gold is likely to push back down - that could mean the VIX also spikes.
5256 2018-08-07 15:17:18 In some cases yes. The stability of global oil markets in exchange for security guarantees from Washington. Far from perfect, but almost non-stop crises – over human rights, the Arab-Israeli conflict, the war in Syria, Iran – have systematically failed to break the partnership.

5260 2018-08-07 15:16:45 Things people believe: Pakistan has the biggest oil reserve in the world anyway if not for yahoodi shazish and agreements between our corrupt politicians. Kuwait who?
5261 2018-08-07 15:16:45 A common argument against oil infrastructure projects for port cities is that they offer few benefits to the members of the community, outside of some local jobs, while posing significant risks to safety and public health locally and to the climate globally, and thus are often ..

5275 2018-08-07 15:15:31 Bring them to their Knees in the Supreme Court just like what happened to Standard Oil.
5276 2018-08-07 15:15:30 It go 1 for the homies, 2 for the down bitch, 3 for the lawyer, 4 for the oil! I wake up time to bake up & raise the bar

5279 2018-08-07 15:15:24 Changed my mind came to my car dealership for an oil change @Kia
5280 2018-08-07 15:15:17 You realize that all the oil from the Middle East is shipped via the Persian Gulf & Iran has control of those ports. OPEC still controls massive distribution of oil & Iran is a member of OPEC. Please, name one country that doesn't directly or indirectly trades w/Iran?
5281 2018-08-07 15:15:16 So those decide to continue doing business with Iran can drop the dollar as a transaction currency for oil contract?
5282 2018-08-07 15:15:12 Ya fuckin niggas that can’t even do a simple oil change

5284 2018-08-07 15:14:51 Washing your hands and arms after you get in poison ivy will help dry the oil up and keep it from spreading too
5285 2018-08-07 15:14:48 altruism and cooperation will do no good unless we put oil companies out of business. so, save the cooperation for the rebuilding. now is the time for tearing down the oil companies.
5286 2018-08-07 15:14:47 What’s also interesting is Eddy and Lea Counties, from which oil & gas production basically funds K-12 education, votes completely opposite of SF and ABQ. Will make the Fall Governors election very interesting.
5287 2018-08-07 15:14:46 Because you have an oil bloc?
5288 2018-08-07 15:14:43 Another idea would be to reduce or eliminate our dependence on oil so we can cut them loose entirely.
5289 2018-08-07 15:14:31 I agree- half the country uses Canadian Oil the other half doesnt get its hands dirty.  Its stupid. If this is motivation to stop importing oil- thank you- please toss out more idiots and expedite the process.
5290 2018-08-07 15:14:09 Whats his plan to stop devaluing of Pak Rupee & increase Foreign reserves.  As a FM whats his strategy to lower down Oil prices.

5291 2018-08-07 15:14:05 Trump leads markets to trade war .so oil prices will down to 55-60$ soon

140g 00 flour
2 egg yolks
pinch salt
teaspoon olive oil

Mix SLOWLY in processor 'till "just" together
hand knead to finish
cling film, then rest in fridge for 20 mins
and Bob's yer uncle!

Good luck!

The sesame oil, green onions, and salt would go well with grilled chicken skins.

5326 2018-08-07 15:10:51 Politicians are supposed to be FOR/representing, the average American citizen.  That’s what Bernie is saying here.  No one said that liberals hate successful wealthy people.  That’s a false generalization to make you feel justified in voting for a snake oil salesman.
5327 2018-08-07 15:10:44 I read somewhere that Canada has like, alot of oil, ya know? 

But it's probably easier to just making the KSA wealthier and screw Canadian jobs.

5351 2018-08-07 15:08:14 All of the birthday money I got is going towards my car (tags, oil change, windshield wipers) and school  the adult life is just great 
5352 2018-08-07 15:07:59 In light of Meuller's uncovering of schemes to hide money, Gates and Manafort, why didn't he want to investigate 2 oil companies in Colorado defrauding millions?
5353 2018-08-07 15:07:58 Private or no but they do function as public space. If bakery does not serve you start your own, if oil is not sold to you start your own refinery. Can do just ok without cakes not so much without oil. Alex is-was idiot however it should be up to state, not corporation.
5354 2018-08-07 15:07:55 Oil Companies can only hire people, who have been admitted to, andsucceeded in pursuing, the essential educational prerequisites. It is importantthat education becomes a key component of the African Local Content Strategy.

5357 2018-08-07 15:07:50 I really like the raw liver with sesame oil, green onions, and salt.

5365 2018-08-07 15:07:15 You mean like the auto industry and the oil industry subsidies? Same rules apply. It also means corporate tax breaks should be lowered or cut by that reasoning.
5366 2018-08-07 15:07:13 Please research Venezuela before you spout misinformation. Economic sanctions and the price of oil are major contributing factors to the current situation in venz.

5370 2018-08-07 15:07:07 I take CBD oil (the legal “whole plant extract” found online rather than “hemp derived” as sold in most health food shops which is different). I’ve not been consistent with taking it tho I have done in flares. It helps a little. Hope you find relief soon!
5371 2018-08-07 15:06:55 I’ll definitely try the peppermint oil! Thank you! 
5372 2018-08-07 15:06:49 Well you cant be independent in oil production unless you get your hands dirty and disregard the environmental hazards of extracting your dirty high cost oil which is not sustainable now given the current oil prices anyways
5373 2018-08-07 15:06:33 Don't think a little bit if baby oil is to much Hamrick lol.
5374 2018-08-07 15:06:27 I just want my damn car keys so I can go to work and buy some damn oil..
5375 2018-08-07 15:06:12 as soon as they try to stop iran exporting oil, without KSA and gulf states oil there is no need for $ no buying of the fiat currency
5376 2018-08-07 15:06:10 He said picking a fight with everyone in the world. OPEC will raise the prices oil and Americans will pay the price.
5377 2018-08-07 15:06:02 @realDonaldTrump For us, it is very important for a full boycott of oil, until November 4, Iran's oil exports should reach zero and there is no exemption, the exemption from sanctions is unacceptable and will never be accepted. November is the end of Iranian oil
5378 2018-08-07 15:05:56 sorry but your explanation has no scientific basis. measurements spanning decades show a consistent and accelerating warming. co2 levels are not declining but increasing faster than ever. there are no 'aerosol injections' but the natural dimming effect of coal & oil.
5379 2018-08-07 15:05:51 Also I've been fairly deep in the guts of energy and ag infrastructure.  Powerplant engineering, directional drilling on oil rigs, and now drop out farmhand.

5393 2018-08-07 15:04:28 Socialism doesn't work.

In the very few places where it hasn't gone completely to crap, it's because the population is tiny, homogeneous, and is sitting on top of a gigantic oil field. Essentially, when the country is one big oil company (relying on capitalism elsewhere).
5394 2018-08-07 15:04:24 So how did she get medical cannabis oil in Scotland? Also,  did she have a TURBT? Was her cancer non-muscle-invasive or not? Does her oncologist say she's cured?
It's good that your mum is doing well, but there are almost certainly other explanations for her cure.
5395 2018-08-07 15:04:08 And charcoal within inches of the oil.  Good thing kitty's there to prevent a fire.

5410 2018-08-07 15:02:49 One implication is higher Oil prices, which usually help support uranium prices and push them higher.  Could inflame Russia - US tensions which could affect U imports.  Hard to say. We'll see... Cheers!

5421 2018-08-07 15:01:43 If the liberals are really that offended by the Saudis human rights why do we buy any oil at all from them? Oh wait a second - because the Saudis underpin Canada’s ineffective “social licence” by keeping the pollution in their country. Very convenient.
5422 2018-08-07 15:01:43 Pimples medications work by reducing oil production, speeding up skin cell turnover, fighting bacterial infection or reducing inflammation — which helps prevent scarring. #health
5423 2018-08-07 15:01:40 Alex Jones should be shunned from the Right and Left.  He peddles absolute political snake oil crap.

5424 2018-08-07 15:01:36 There are other jobs than just being a firefighter

Fire Suppression is what they are trained for and what they can apply for. There are also private organizations that hire for this type of work. It also can help you qualify for working on oil fields, fire suppression training

1) The ayatollahs will be replaced by another group as anti-American or more.
2) European countries will tell Trump that they need Iranian oil and tell him off.
5435 2018-08-07 15:00:56 Actually this could be a good thing, let them take their terrorists back and they can keep their dirty oil because we've got our own

5460 2018-08-07 14:59:28 If only it were that easy. While Trudeau’s virtue signals to the Saudis obviously backfired, all OPEC and the Saudis have to do is keep oil prices low enough to make Canadian oil economically non viable.
5461 2018-08-07 14:59:18 Albertans are oil experts and ready for the next Big Boom.. we are on standby-bring it on! Until they release better energy technology we are stuck with fossil fuels...so why not use the mother lode we are sitting on? Lets make some BIG $$$ "Make Alberta Great Again!"

5464 2018-08-07 14:59:10 I know, we should have a pipeline to take oil from Saskatchewan and Alberta to the East Coast!!!
5465 2018-08-07 14:59:09 Weird that he didn’t ask President Reagan about all the hidden subsidies the federal government provides to driving. Stop subsidizing automakers, the trucking industry, and oil companies so we get to an understanding of the full cost burden placed on American roads.

5476 2018-08-07 14:58:35 They have oil and other capatialist products they sell. They also are the size of one small state. Sweden is going to hell in a handbasket. Bad comparison..

5488 2018-08-07 14:57:19 If only there was some place else we could get oil? Too bad the east would rather SA oil than Alberta's. Better to ship oil half way around the world then halfway across our country.

5497 2018-08-07 14:56:45 Let's simplify this. Does the government of Norway own the country's mineral resource, namely oil? If so, why is this a problem when non western countries want to do the same?

5508 2018-08-07 14:55:21 Comment from @KyleTrouble blog:

"I can drive to my local supermarket and buy imported olive oil from Italy in a glass jar. For a fair price.

I see the benefits of owning a brand, but I just don’t see this as a good market. "

What does this tell us about business?

5526 2018-08-07 14:53:42 Quatar is a bad example as over 90% of their exports are oil and gas that are desperately needed. People have to buy it. We have nothing in such quantities that can't be bought from elsewhere.

5629 2018-08-07 14:43:51 My brother was on opioids for 5 yrs ( motorcycle wreck n 3 back n neck surgeries)I saw how he changed mentally and physically he started using the CBD oil for his pain he quite the opioids cold turkey and is now free from them.

5631 2018-08-07 14:43:39 P.S. That oil isn’t “ethical” when it’s a stolen resource, extracted from stolen land, without consent.

If you want it to be “ethical”, the land needs to go back to FNs, we need to honour Indigenous rights (FPIC), AND there needs to be reparations for all the harm we’ve done.

5634 2018-08-07 14:43:30 There is contingency planning that can be done that does not touch foreign policy.  Economic Development and planning etc. They are not doing that, that shows you how impactful No Deal is seen internally.

So the SG would be happy to deliver all of Scotland's oil fields to EU?

5638 2018-08-07 14:43:13 We never learned the lessons of the 1973 Arab Oil Embargo, the 1978-1979 Energy Crisis, and 2002 Mini-Crisis. Our oil consumption leads directly to war in the Middle East and climate change. I think we need to understand the true costs and weigh actual need versus imagined need.
5639 2018-08-07 14:43:11 Do any UK supermarkets sell Palestinian olive oil? It would be lovely to create a demand for it.

5652 2018-08-07 14:41:59 I'm glad we have no overall dependency on KSA oil. If we we were all hooked on their exports, they'd have us over a barrel, so to speak. Would we then be calling them on this? According to the above replies, it may be political suicide.

5656 2018-08-07 14:41:37 Let me sing you the song of my people  We have a good system, maybe too good. Some people will always take advantage of it. The future is coming so I’m guessing things will get harder soon. We now have to save up for our own pension. The oil is running out.
5657 2018-08-07 14:41:22 Ivy leaves going brown & falling off. Possible culprit red spider mite which are too small to see but suck sap. Warm temps this summer was ideal conditions for them.

5658 2018-08-07 14:41:20 Exactly my point. No oil was discovered in the 7th century in order to even guess they will become that rich to build the tallest buildings so how did he know?

It's very specific as its not just talking about Arabs but Bedouins which are the people of the UAE

5668 2018-08-07 14:40:27 We import oil, refine it and then export the refined products. We export almost no domestic oil. We export domestic natural gas because we have an abundance of it.

5675 2018-08-07 14:39:06 The Yaris is a great car. It’s very affordable to repair but requires little maintenance. Just be aware that it’s like Toyota Corolla that requires a different oil filter - oil change mechanics charge extra for them. I’d buy a dozen or so for $2 each - save $4 on oil changes.

5682 2018-08-07 14:38:31 Currently, we are backed by the price of oil (petro dollar) and the necessity of other countries to hold our monopoly money to buy oil. When that ends, China is ready to step up with their gold back $$. What will happen to gold ownership then?

5694 2018-08-07 14:37:40 There are plenty of old and several massive new projects in Finland. Not all can start. For example the Kuopio site already has a mill from 1968 that produces fluting. It’s currently owned by Mondi. The new one would produce 1.1M tons of long-fibre pulp and 60k tons of tall oil.

5699 2018-08-07 14:37:14 Yeah I very well think that you won't get what you want. The oil money you saved is currently eaten up by a massive budget deficit and if you'd continue like this you're soon going to be some uninportant desert again. Would be a damn waste.

5734 2018-08-07 14:34:21 Get they can redirect it within country to power gen etc.  - but for international oil market it's still going to be primarily about how much oil is coming out. 

I'll defer on the wooden boats part until November... then the hunt begins
5735 2018-08-07 14:34:21 I do understand. I brought up palm oil to highlight how unimportant it is to live up to this one definition while allowing exceptions that are just as harmful, but still getting to call yourself vegan cause one definition suits you

5742 2018-08-07 14:33:40 I was addressing your issue re: Trump & Iran. I don't disagree that Saudi Arabia has many of the same issues I listed re: Iran but arguably they are a more stable nation & have geopolitical value in the region. If oil is the main value we'd have commendered Iraq's.

5745 2018-08-07 14:33:27 Plus, most of the 70k commercial ships on the sea today burn fuel oil, which is a waste product of the refining process. From 2020 these vessels will be mostly burning distillates (gasoil/diesel) which is a refined grade so will have quite an impact on crude prices.

5778 2018-08-07 14:30:19 It's the antitrust/public utility question. @JZmirak points out that if Ma Bell had acted like this, conservatives wouldn't have been allowed on the telephone. Maybe free market competition can fix it, maybe not. But moving from FB is a lot harder than just buying cheaper oil.

5783 2018-08-07 14:29:44 Cut off their oil supply to eastern Canada. See if the idiots would have built energy east pipeline we would have to rely on foreign oil and we could grown our own economy. Those crooked Politicians in Quebec are the cause of the problem.

5794 2018-08-07 14:28:46 WHY ARE WE buying Saudi Oil , and not processing our own for the East coast- we literally feed the hand that beats us ish.  Its easy get our national energy program to move much faster than its pathetic pace - that will impact them.
5795 2018-08-07 14:28:43 Vehicle would be including as our country does not have reliable public transportation everywhere.  The vehicle deduction should be capped at a mean value that considers insurance and standard operating costs, such as gas, oil changes etc.

5801 2018-08-07 14:28:26 Soo Trump said we won't trade with anyone who trades with Iran, well guess we have an oil crisis again (OPEC), can't trade with the EU at all, China, South Korea, Singapore, the UAE.... Ok time to watch the economy implode! Ya, you sure are making America great again asshole

5808 2018-08-07 14:27:48 Canada is rich with oil and other natural resources.  Why are they dealing with this demonic ideology?  The US (regrettably) does so to preserve the dwindling "petro dollar", but it seems like Canada could pass.

Don't use in areas where it could get in contact with pets (especially cats), though. Also: likely to work better before the nest is fully built / the colony is established.
5820 2018-08-07 14:26:29 Exactly why we should supply our own oil and stop buying from countries still in the dark ages.
5821 2018-08-07 14:26:29 @KeepCanWorking (an #ableg initiative) is making false and misleading claims in advertisements on TV about #TMX: "this doesn't mean there will be more oil, it just means it will sell at a higher price".

5828 2018-08-07 14:26:14 I've been sitting in this car dealership since before 7am for an oil change and inspection. I'm about to lose it and I'm typically the most chill person when it comes to this stuff.

5835 2018-08-07 14:25:52 As long as they are soft (giving oil) towards India,US and to some extent Israel,we must ignore them.
More danger in middle East is from Iran and Yemen (Houthi). Watch for Iran, Syria, Turkey,Yemen,Quwait and Russia combination.

Free to bully me, go ahead
5839 2018-08-07 14:25:26 Notice that no one is talking about production.  They are talking about exports.   Why?   Yes, exports affect global oil market.... but also no one wants to do the hard job of focusing on production.  There is a reason why Iran focus on joint fields... and swaps
5840 2018-08-07 14:25:17 If time is taken to make sure the people have some relation to the kids at all- and are not trying to harm them-they don’t send them with traffickers in the first place to NEED to get the kids back and prosecute them.

5857 2018-08-07 14:22:58 Yes most of the oil company & mine's belong to the US / UK. 
You call it foreign investors. Spend money so that they can make money 
It taks capital build it up and when a countrys take like venez and zim just take it away from this foreign company the country takes action
5858 2018-08-07 14:22:55 Only to the rich and shameless, don’t want there dirty money.  We should be making our own oil.
5859 2018-08-07 14:22:55 since we are discounting the impact of major oil market shifts entirely on the basis of a supposedly wrong economic system, lets also talk about the success of the Greek capitalst economy. Jst for fair contrast

5876 2018-08-07 14:20:51 @CFRASnow Yes, to a total ban on imports of Saudi oil. BTW, Saudi Arabia deliberately depressed the price of oil a few years back in order to force unconventional oil producers (shale oil & oil sands) out of the market. This hurt Canada. Saudi regime is unprincipled.
5877 2018-08-07 14:20:50 Woke up early, went to vote, got my oil checked, went to the bank to get my move in money, and changed my address. I just have to pack the rest of my stuff and I will be all set for the move.

5889 2018-08-07 14:20:06 It's insane...with oil prices changing every other day, they should realize it's a kind of volatile industry and shouldn't be the only thing funding education, healthcare, etc...

5900 2018-08-07 14:19:13 It was naive in the first place to think that MbS is really reforming the Saudi Arabian society. He's only trying to prolong their absolute monarchy where respect for human rights are ignored completely and critics of regime are brutally silenced. Nobody cares because of oil!

"it has also actively sought to influence the geography of pipeline routes from Central Asia in order to limit Russia’s control over European oil and gas markets as well as over the scale and direction of oil and gas supplies from Central Asia"

5906 2018-08-07 14:18:38 Is this the one where Shirley Temple dreams he's a giant baby and climbs a ladder up his high chair to feed him some cod liver oil and then powders a giant diaper? Dennis Hopper couldn't make a movie this trippy.
5907 2018-08-07 14:18:31 OK is is far worse fiscal shape. Oil prices plummeting over the past year and a lack of alternative revenue options has resulted in drastic cuts to public services. Teachers in the state are underpaid and many school districts have switched to a 4-day school week.
5908 2018-08-07 14:18:30 Research is inconclusive re. Coconut oil as a food.
5909 2018-08-07 14:18:26 Who give a company with oil and mining directors on the board 444 million to look after the reef... Oh yeah take 45 million use it to pay the board
5910 2018-08-07 14:18:20 Sweet let’s build that trans Canada pipeline and stop buying Saudi Oil!
5911 2018-08-07 14:18:19 I S2G I can’t leave this VW dealership without dropping over a hundy and it’s really frustrating and I just wanna cry every time I come in for something as simple as an oil change

5915 2018-08-07 14:17:57 The UK is the number one culprit in fighting against Jesus in the world and all bcos of the massive capitalisation coming from the Arabian petrodollars. The election of Khan as mayor was dictated to the govt and mainstream media by oil politics.
5916 2018-08-07 14:17:54 Reminds me of my Gran cooking in Beef dripping in one of those old pans with a mesh 'ladle' in it ... but wow the smell !!!    Might try it again just for the hell of it !!
5917 2018-08-07 14:17:48 So Saudi Arabia is upset with us. We buy oil from SA. Let me understand this..we buy oil from women abusing radicals but don’t support pipelines in our own country? 
That’s like buying milk from the a crazy stranger when your best friend owns a dairy farm.

5919 2018-08-07 14:17:44 The human error is giving in to an impulse when you know it is wrong/ having a moment of weakness. It doesnt mean you dont care, it means you have room to grow. Vegans still using palm oil are given room to grow even tho its just as harmful to animals/ppl

5921 2018-08-07 14:17:36 Yeah, I recommend doing this while at home. The garlic scent can be off putting to some, but coconut oil is an alternative.
5922 2018-08-07 14:17:36 This meal is over 1,500 calories (but I could easily boost the calories with more noodle and olive oil). It’s completely healthy (although I eat less carbs as I’m diabetic). I could simply add more noodle and feed 6 people with this for under $10 CAD.
5923 2018-08-07 14:17:26 Soo what can i do for hair growth other than hot oil treatments??
5924 2018-08-07 14:17:18 I didn't really want cocktails with his snake oil supplements in them.

It's an interesting point that i'd like to see evidence for.
5942 2018-08-07 14:14:57 Where does our oil come from?
5943 2018-08-07 14:14:54 To me, one of the biggest takeaways from Saudi Arabia’s behavior over the weekend is that Canada has a responsibility to have the infrastructure to get our ethical oil to market. #pipelines #abparty #abpoli #ableg #centretogether #abvote #teamalbertaparty

5964 2018-08-07 14:13:11 The majority of EU is interested in trade, oil, greed &money. They want the cheapest goods from Iran. President Trump is hearing the voices of the brave freedom fighters in Iran who are currently risking their lives protesting for freedom &EU still won’t let go of the Mullahs.
5965 2018-08-07 14:13:06 Why do we need Saudi Oil? There are many alternatives. We need to stand up for Canada and give Bullies of the world a cold shoulder and go about our business

5967 2018-08-07 14:13:03 This morning I watched a video of olive oil being made the old-fashioned cold-pressed method with big granite wheels for crushing and fiber disks for pressing... I know now what Virgin Olive Oil and Extra Virgin Olive Oil means...

5971 2018-08-07 14:12:44 so now, Avocado Oil is not easily accessible, it narrows down to coconut oil which is accessible and healthy
5972 2018-08-07 14:12:24 Crude oil can go lowest
5973 2018-08-07 14:12:13 Your asking for oil...same thing for the past 60 years...only different country
5974 2018-08-07 14:11:51 "Don't like it? Start your own social media company!" is almost as ridiculous today as "Don't like it? Start your own oil refining company!" would've been in the 1880s - Michael Tracey
5975 2018-08-07 14:11:50 Yes fortune comes with right person in command. Glad to hear this news earlier Friday and curious to see once they bump on real oil.

5979 2018-08-07 14:11:42 I like the idea of getting an oil pipeline across Canada so we can use our own oil. Rather than importing from Saudi. One thing that gets me about social media is, you’re immediately assumed to be left or right leaning. I vote blue, but lean a little left.

5982 2018-08-07 14:11:38 NOPE.. this is NOT true, you are just twisting words to fit what you think but what is not true with data. You really should take time and read about the Palm Oil value chain before making such conclusions

5987 2018-08-07 14:10:57 If you look at their profiles, most have joined Twitter since Model 3 first delivery. They all follow each other and egg each other on.  I don’t think they are funded by investing, but rather it’s a campaign likely funded by oil $. If so they are paying $$ for stupid.

-Because they sponsor campaigns.
Why is Big Pharma allowed to continue to make money?
-Because they’re one of the most powerful lobbying interests in the world.

5993 2018-08-07 14:10:27 I think what broke the camels back is when he began targeting specific families who were victims of mass shootings. Which then got them targeted by specific individuals who threatened to harm them. The man has been selling snake oil for years enough is enough

6000 2018-08-07 14:09:47 yeah, and we all ran out of oil way back when. Thing is, even if supplies tighten, our economies can adapt. That's what capitalism is really good at.

6005 2018-08-07 14:08:29 So tougher then you put on your good friends in Russia. Yep that makes sense. Iran didn’t install you as president and Putin needs to reassert his control over Iran. Getting you to reapply the sanctions let’s him buy their oil cheaper and sell them supplies they can’t get.
6006 2018-08-07 14:08:26 You're suggesting imported oil + America the beautiful drilled for no gain by Americans. It's not like we will get free oil. I suggest we import like we do while researching for better ways of powering our cars....
6007 2018-08-07 14:08:23 Majority of the time they are coming across the border alone- not w/ their parents-it turns out in a LARGE percent of the cases that the ppl bringing them across aren’t even related to them- many are kidnapped.

6011 2018-08-07 14:07:50 most airlines except the ones from the oil economies are not doing ,ba is privatised ,most us including delta ,AA etc are feeling the pinch,lufthansa is ok as everything has to transit thro frankfurt ,air india is up for grabs ,indigo is not doing well ,spice jet  is route clever

6024 2018-08-07 14:06:56 Trudeau and his group of Sharia enablers have been taught in Saudi a convert is still a second class better than a Christian still beneath a Muslim.  Being an oil rich nation we should start producing more of it. #WalkAway

6032 2018-08-07 14:05:57 Do you know if tea tree oil is okay for rabbits? When my rabbits paw was bleeding, I sprayed tea tree oil mixed with water on it just in case
6033 2018-08-07 14:05:46 You haven't said anything to rebut the points made in this piece. There are geopolitical tradeoffs to keeping California oil in the ground and overall a very small net change in oil production.

6041 2018-08-07 14:05:00 @kyle_park Where is your PPE in the "Don't Forget Where You Come From" music video? If you come from the oil patch, you know that safety is a core value.

6043 2018-08-07 14:04:57 The tax cuts along with low unemployment are actually contributing more dollars to the government coffers. Tonnes of money pouring back into the country from companies like Apple that parked it in Ireland. Steel Mills reopening. New gas and oil wells be drilled.

6049 2018-08-07 14:04:08 a lie is like a thick oil poured into a small amount of soy sauce, once its poured, you'll see how the oil separates from the soy sauce quickly, which means, no matter what happens, the truth and the lie will never be at the same level.

6057 2018-08-07 14:03:42 It would seem to matter quite a lot given oil price is moving on expectations 1m b/d plus is going to be knocked out come November... and that those moving it - previously or in future - risk getting their collar felt by the long-arm of the US.

6062 2018-08-07 14:03:27 You're going to get outsmarted again Simpleton-in-Chief. Iran is gushing in oil. They'll use it to support our enemies. This was a colossal, amateurish, & regrettable mistake by someone (you) who is naive & embarrassingly ignorant on the world stage.

6065 2018-08-07 14:02:59 I’m making the point that human traffickers ( they happen to be who apprehended them) do come across the border and the kids don’t belong with them.
6066 2018-08-07 14:02:59 Blithering idiots think that by sacrificing our beautiful land for oil will make gas cheaper..instead it wrecks the land and we will be sold the same priced imported oil.
6067 2018-08-07 14:02:39 Didn't he try and convince the EU to stop buying oil from Russia? You aren't making much sense.

6069 2018-08-07 14:02:37 Another way of putting the question:

6074 2018-08-07 14:01:51 And because the Canadian government has screwed up Canada so much, and impeded our capabilities in crude oil and refineries, now Canadians will suffer another rude awakening! And the liberal media stays mum on the continued government screw ups!

6079 2018-08-07 14:01:03 You are all aware of course that 60yrs. ago Iran had a modern parliamentary democracy but it was toppled by US and UK because it was going to vote to nationalize Iran's oil reserves!

6094 2018-08-07 13:59:48 good to know..does the grade of olive oil make a difference?
6095 2018-08-07 13:59:40 Oh look, the weak kneed pup speaks. You are all bluster, but frankly can't accomplish anything without oil money. Oil stops .... so does your country. To are too obsessed with religion and repressing your women to accomplish anything.

He actually tried to get people to believe  this had nothing to do with big oil? They lobby for this,just like the old Red Line Trains removal
6115 2018-08-07 13:57:20 The early responses to the crisis was exactly that. Much of the 70's bicycling revival was a direct response to the oil crisis, and lots of people took up biking. However, co-opting of the traffic planning profession by VC'ers meant that bicycle infrastructure didn't get built.

6133 2018-08-07 13:55:23 Venezuela has the world's largest oil reserves. But during the country's oil boom in the 1970s, Venezuela's politicians decided to keep all of the country's oil revenues instead of sharing them with the imperialists behind foreign companies. ( Anglo this, Anglo that is ZA mines)

6137 2018-08-07 13:55:00 We destroyed #Iran road to democracy in 1951 to get our greedy hands on their oil & refused to let them recover. Must still be about #oil . Just sayin...  TY @Trevornoah for the history lesson last night. I hope you do this again.

6159 2018-08-07 13:52:29 And if it is that we are dealing with addiction to oil why do fossil fuel companies have access to policy development? We don’t have heroin dealers make drug policy - why should Big Oil make climate policy? This article is intellectually dishonest and misleading with that device.

6171 2018-08-07 13:50:32 Policies put in place by the last government to curb scarcity of fuel your man reversed it set price at 145 per litre when oil price rose no one wanted to import fuel only to sell at a loss that was why scarcity lasted that long but your man didn't care
6172 2018-08-07 13:50:24 One step closer to raising the prices of oil, for Putin?
6173 2018-08-07 13:50:24 The Kingdom of #Saudi_Arabia granted $60 million worth of oil derivatives per month to power plants in #Yemen to operate 24/7 to alleviate the suffering caused to the Brotherly Yemeni people by Iranian-backed Houthi militias’ practices

6177 2018-08-07 13:50:06 many vegans don’t consume palm oil

Butkus sure you can understand why palm oil is so controversial because it’s not an animal nor does it come from an animal. 

Yes our unsustainable and unethical harvest of it harms animals, but as i said, this is why many don’t consume it.

6183 2018-08-07 13:49:48 one must acknowledge that under communism - in any world that is to bear greater semblence to the world to come - certain luxuries & exploitations that we've come to demand as normal would no longer be so

in the case of pineapples, this may be a shame. but as for oil, fantastic

6190 2018-08-07 13:49:03 @abu_augusta your head too get oil. Asin your statement just make sense wella.
6191 2018-08-07 13:49:02  It is very possible within the near future that the US Petrodollar will end as a primary global currency for oil.  
6192 2018-08-07 13:48:48 Add butter (real) into your diet.  Use coldpressed virgin olive oil and coconut oil in cooking.  You should have two pats of butter at each meal.  This will help the cravings.  Fats give your body energy over a long period of time.  Withholding them causes cravings.
6193 2018-08-07 13:48:47 So you're gonna wait until November before you use sanctions against oil, cuz that'll make ya look really tough, right around elections, its all just a show for you, you don't give a crap about world peace unless you have a starring role.

6211 2018-08-07 13:47:29 NEW: @AmbJohnBolton says, "We're working with all countries to reduce oil imports from Iran to zero. We're making progress on that. We think these sanctions are biting already, and we think they will continue to bite and cause significant negative economic consequences for Iran."

What's your point?
6219 2018-08-07 13:46:44 I think senior went to war over the price of oil and jr went to war because they threatened his dad.

Did jr know? NO, but he was itching for a fight and he got a reason.

Of more concern is what Obama is doing to cover his tracks, save his legacy and promote global marxism.

6270 2018-08-07 13:40:58 I honestly find it odd America still has a relationship with Saudi's seeing as they funded 9/11 and provided the hijackers. But then I guess oil and money are more important.

6284 2018-08-07 13:39:57 I read the article and i can agree with you. However, do you think it’s more economical than whatever human rights’ concerns. Do you think Canada’s oil sands is competing with the Saudi oil in the oil market especially after Iran’s sanctions. I know it’s a long shot 
6285 2018-08-07 13:39:53 Yes. Even free last mile connectivity for 5 years, Rs 5 - 10/- tickets for first three stations, holiday/lean time discounts, 3 to 5 min frequency etc. Will help draw more people to metro and reduce use of Pvt vehicles. Oil is imported and pollutes

6292 2018-08-07 13:39:31 No. They have campaigned against you with some of our biggest enemies and making record oil sales. If things continue like this, they will separate Europeans from us as well. You’re an idiot when it comes to anything. Just like your university. You’re a mob boss liar.

6305 2018-08-07 13:37:53 Plano raw ng ating gobyerno na humirit ng higit pa sa 60-40 na hatiang inaalok nito sa China mula sa kikitain sa isinusulong na joint oil exploration, ayon kay Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano. Live mula sa Quezon City, may report si @jpsoriano
6306 2018-08-07 13:37:48 hey guys don forget sth! putin is with iran , putin is with trump , so trump - iran war ain’t gonna happen , now why the sanctions?! cuz the oil price goes up so saudi and other rich arabs can get more money meaning more guns to be bought from NRA all part of plan ,headache...

6309 2018-08-07 13:37:37 I used the oil blend this morning for a creak in my neck discomfort dropped from a level 10 to 2 in minutes, amazed at how quickly it worked 
6310 2018-08-07 13:37:34 Less than one year.

Look at the entire region, social unrest in iran could drive oil over 100+ because clerics will not walk off into sunset quietly.  Coupled with currency deflation, weighted against USD denominated bonds/ debts, a recipe 4 disaster
6311 2018-08-07 13:37:33 I've now been here for damn near 3 hours without even a hint of an update on what's going on with this oil change and inspection. Better be getting that crude straight from the Alaskan pipeline.

6315 2018-08-07 13:37:07 Why do cars have door handles?  Or rear view mirrors?  Is oil food or drink?  Is a flat tire like a broken shoe or a broken ankle?  How do they grow from childhood?  Little cars can't become big cars.  That's a decent start.
6316 2018-08-07 13:37:04 She vex our @oil_shaeikh

6343 2018-08-07 13:34:53 Sedan vs. Truck/SUV demand has in the past shifted based on the macroeconomic cycle, and primarily the oil prices. This was true in all previous cycles. This time, however, as oil prices surge in 2H18/2019, demand will shift back to sedans, but primarily Model 3.
6344 2018-08-07 13:34:52 Vitamin E oil is doing wonders.

6350 2018-08-07 13:34:32 A zero-sum game. Iran losing India and gaining China in terms of Oil imports.India has booked a total of 9.94 million barrels of crude, about 319,000 bpd to arrive from the US this month.
6351 2018-08-07 13:34:28 Al Oil le queda subida. Puede que el punto de inflexión sea cuando Aramco saque parte de su negocio a la vente y aproveche para distribuir y empaquetarle acciones a toda la peña
6352 2018-08-07 13:34:28 You can make a spray with peppermint essential oil and water (~10-15 drops in a squirty bottle) and squirt it on them and it messes up their pheromone trails! I used it on an ant break-in in my bathroom recently and it worked surprisingly well.
6353 2018-08-07 13:34:24 Probably because of oil/gas. The price of everything fluctuates with the price of oil.

6355 2018-08-07 13:34:18 Trudeau was in Montreal for Canada Day (it is Canada Day accross Canada on July 1st). Also, Canada isn’t giving money to Saudi Arabia, although Irving inc. does buy some of their oil.

6360 2018-08-07 13:33:35 Why did they wait 30 years to remove the oil from the ship?? Waiting until it leaked into the ocean is negligent.
6361 2018-08-07 13:33:31 An unexpected new alliance is forming between PAS, GPS and GBS. They were fighting for the same course for oil royalty before and today they both against GST and SST.

6372 2018-08-07 13:32:21 Examples: PAC and corporate money influence politicians to spend more on military, subsidize oil and coal, fund pipelines, clean up hazardous spills, sanction various countries, engage in counterproductive trade deals, offer unproportional tax cuts to the wealthy, etc.

6385 2018-08-07 13:31:16 OIL 1H CAUTION, technically we have an issue and oil is signaling lower, much lower this moment. HOD is BELOW 69.91 & formed a TRIPLE TOP & Head & Shoulders, both bear pattern signals. I was expecting the push to move much higher than this and stay bullish. WATCH

6453 2018-08-07 13:23:32 As a Canadian I stand for human rights no one should be mistreated or taken from parents or maligned for race, sexual orientation or gender. Without oil they would be nomads.
6454 2018-08-07 13:23:11 Oh I think that's not very likely given the political motivation of the bordre change but I'm not just talking about oil, I'm talking about all our natural resources and human resources too.  We have a wealth of resources in this small country that are being wasted.

6456 2018-08-07 13:23:08 So if you're arguing Iran was actually exporting far more oil under the previous sanctions regime than widely accepted, where did it go? 

I don't deny there was smuggling... but most major traders I've spoken with think it was only in the 10s of thousands b/d...
6457 2018-08-07 13:23:01 Correction 73% thanks to the fake resistance bot who let me know I made a grammar booboo.  Oh and told me we have good reasons for supporting Saudi Arabia...yea no we don't if we got off oil and stopped meddling in the middle east we wouldn't have to.
6458 2018-08-07 13:23:00 My reference was to his book “Ethical Oil” - as such, selling military equipment to the Saudi government...
6459 2018-08-07 13:22:58 All they want to do is to destabilize their adversaries and keep the price of oil up. I believe it is really that simple.
6460 2018-08-07 13:22:49 As Big Oil keeps pouring gasoline on the planet.
6461 2018-08-07 13:22:49 The problem is, everyone who uses the service has signed the TOS and if they're broken they can boot you off. Even infowars has a bloody TOS. 

With all the money he has made selling snake oil he can host his own bloody videos fine.
6462 2018-08-07 13:22:45 What do you need oil for? Don't they have butter where you live?

6471 2018-08-07 13:22:16 Yes, they export much oil; however, we buy off the "world market." Other than oil, what do they export or manufacture, for that matter? Oil we either fade away or simple run out. We need to move away from fossil fuels, now. We need renuables-- and lots of them.

6476 2018-08-07 13:21:29 Ya I believe.. US will impose sanctions on India on their oil trade with Iran and it should be..
6477 2018-08-07 13:21:09 Thats why I always have my own backup of home made (read really crappy made) beard oil, just in case these things happen. and yes they happen a lot when a semi conscious man tries to groom himself. :D
6478 2018-08-07 13:21:02 Nobody is saying $tsla isn't a business. Sociopathic would be Ford battling an inventor in court for 20 yrs or Exxon knowing about climate change for 50 yrs. #Tesla is instead rebuilding puerto Rico and taking on big oil. That's smart investment AND altruism.

6480 2018-08-07 13:20:37 Omg now where will we get our oil from? Saudis only export.......    
6481 2018-08-07 13:20:31 Trump playing bad cop with Iran is based on the outdated notion of the US as the world’s policeman.
Back your adversary into a corner & you give him no choice but to fight.
In July 1941 the US froze Japanese assets, & in August of the same year imposed an oil embargo.

6512 2018-08-07 13:16:38 Yes and it will boost the economy. Madam, pakistan is going to hit the largest oil reserve at iran-pakistan border. The reservoir is larger than that of the whole oil of kuwait. Plz ask Mr. Prime Minister not to compromise on oil extraction. Sab se pehly Pakistan.

6519 2018-08-07 13:16:21 Totally agree, Natal. We can no longer look to governments for environmental leadership. We have to take care of things ourselves. The way I see it, governments can get behind big oil all they want... they can’t make us buy the oil. #ActOnClimate #GoodbyeGas

If the media is creating doubt/confusion then you can rest assured something is definitely there.

6547 2018-08-07 13:14:05 What resources? Oil, subject to arbitration division in international courts, might not even be favorably allotted to Scotland.
6548 2018-08-07 13:14:02 AND oil and gas were subsidized 4.8 billion in 2015. I’ve owned 20 cars including Porsche’s and my Model S is far and away the finest car I’ve ever driven; so I Will enjoy my “shit mobile.”

6573 2018-08-07 13:11:44 If the JLP government has decided to cease hedging oil (which it has), then logic would dictate that it should roll back the tax.

 No my loony liberal friend Harry Reid resigned in disgrace.
6577 2018-08-07 13:11:34 Because you drive with their oil, eat at their restaurants, and sleep in homes that they build. And then call them fascist, while being actually fascist, described by your statement. You should probably take a civics class. Should we drink from different water fountains too?
6578 2018-08-07 13:11:33 You’re absolutely right. The thing is, 80% of Japan’s oil was coming from the USA, so when it was embargoed, & the USA made anti-imperialist demands for it to be lifted, Japan refused to give up their ambitions. They had been cornered, & cornering an adversary is often unwise.

6582 2018-08-07 13:10:48 Why y’all ain’t warm me about this exspensivd ass oil change.
6583 2018-08-07 13:10:47 I really don’t think the ‘savings’ from buying food from outside the EU will be passed on by retailers.

I can’t see how palm oil from Indonesia, increasing child labour and no traceablity or food safety checks will really improve the  economy and national health.
6584 2018-08-07 13:10:47 Yeah countless people on the right (who are truly on the right side of things mind you) have been censored over the past few years, but yeah a snake oil salesman gets the ban and suddenly they are the first company to be censored and bla bla bla.

6587 2018-08-07 13:10:24 The Palestinian authority had a deal to build the gas fields and sell it when israel blockaded the strip and took over the field. Now you know why they are blocking Gaza.. They want to steal the Palestinian oil and gas and have stolen their water already.
6588 2018-08-07 13:10:18 Ok other than your oil, what do you offer to the world, you need Pakistanis to build you country, the greatest event that Saudi Arabia’s achievement is letting women drive

6594 2018-08-07 13:09:51 This is so easy, obviously big oil has donated biggly to your legal fund. This only increases the price of oil like your cancellation of the mileage mandate. Oil prices rise they make billions and the American people pay the price. Sold out again.
6595 2018-08-07 13:09:40 La oil esta mucho mas barata , no se por que sera , ah claro no paga impuestos

6626 2018-08-07 13:07:24 Nice find. Congressional hearings on WWII and national defense during early Cold War are filled with this sort of assumption about air power.  So important for creation of national security state... and so much else (including expansive foreign oil policy)

Other things should be done like sinking empty oil tankers, destroying tanker trucks basically anything that drives up the costs for the fossil fuel industry.

6693 2018-08-07 13:01:36 We must all pay close attention. The price of oil could skyrocket unless Saudi Arabia decides to help the U.S. and not Iran. Russia is Iran’s friend already. Every major economy has petroleum at its center. The price of oil goes up, price of everything else follows.

6719 2018-08-07 12:59:29 That’s his point. ANYONE DOING BUSINESS WITH IRAN WILL NOT BE DOING BUSINESS WITH THE USA. He’s talking to China. Yes China will buy more Iranian oil, to the detriment of USA trade. It’s called leverage.

6730 2018-08-07 12:58:34 There are a LOT of things that drove Japan to war with the USA, including racism (from the USA) hamstringing all diplomatic relations. It’s the oil embargo that forced Japan into such a tight logistical bind that they needed to wage war for pragmatic strategic reasons.

6752 2018-08-07 12:56:28 I agree. Alex Jones sells snake oil to gullible people, so I despise his business, but the power of those companies is too great, they have to be impartial to speech (unless it is illegal). This decision will hurt a lot of people, and after that, these companies themselves.

6754 2018-08-07 12:56:27 What they don't seem to take into account is that if we have sustainable renewable energy powering our cars,the state may be losing out on tax at the pumps but the economy will be saving billions annually by not buying Russian or Saudi oil.they want their cake,eat it&eat ours too

6756 2018-08-07 12:56:21 Get your self a magic bullet mixer. Every Morning (because you should be intermittent fasting with Keto as well), mix warm coffee with a tsp of Cocao Powder, 1tbsp of MCT oil, 1 tsp of ghee, and stevia to flavor.

This will significantly stave off hunger, and give you energy.
6757 2018-08-07 12:56:17 It's a legit move in the sport, but that's after they've already covered the other in olive oil as part of sportsmanship.

6795 2018-08-07 12:52:56 Depends what, where and how you drive? Sedan, SUV, pickup truck. It's always good to stick with the manufacturers recommendation but it'll cost more to buy dealer. The major brands are all good nowadays, #Pennzoil, #Castrol, #Mobil 1. I would caution against using recycled oil.
6796 2018-08-07 12:52:53 I had a dream that I was training @KDTrey5, having him just run around a lunch table. He ended up sweating out motor oil and I had to clean it up before the paparazzi came. That’s it.
6797 2018-08-07 12:52:36 Ironic that you would say that given a primary ingredient in “snake oil” was often alcohol; were those kids driving???
6798 2018-08-07 12:52:35 Think of all the gas & oil products that WILL NOT be used over the lifetime of all these cars. Natural for some people to be scared of positive change.
6799 2018-08-07 12:52:35 Why do you think this won't end with a North Korea crazy fudge? Surely that's in Iran's interests as much as Trump's, and they saw what we all saw: handshakes, celebration, Trump #WINING, then back to building missiles, or in Iran's case, selling oil.

6804 2018-08-07 12:52:00 To be perfectly clear - my comments are focussed specifically on this one issue - I’m not stepping my toe into international issues related to human rights. But that’s kinda the point, that’s abundantly clear. This inadvertently corners government on this external oil dependancy.
6805 2018-08-07 12:51:58 Now that we’re focused on Iran will the news ask Giuliani about his work for Reza Zarrab, Turkish Gold trader and architect of the cash for gold scheme for Turkey to buy Iranian oil and evade sanctions?

6808 2018-08-07 12:51:35 Like Jamaican or Haitian Castor Oil. Make sure the bottle just has Castor oil as the ingredient. The closer to the source the better because at least you know it's real and not diluted. It's should not smell great at all.
6809 2018-08-07 12:51:35 Actually, a mixed arnica and SJW oil because this whacked my "funny bone" and I've got a pissed-off nerve in there. I will eventually remember to rotate my elbow *every time I shoot.*
6810 2018-08-07 12:51:26 Russia has nothing to offer the world but oil (and chaos)....as the world moves away from using fossil fuels they need a foothold somewhere - what would be the greatest coup, but taking everything from their ideological enemy?!

6817 2018-08-07 12:50:52 I'm pretty sure that oil is made from dead microorganisms that lived in the ocean for millions of years before plants even existed. Coal is made from plants. Dinosaurs didn't really have the luck to turn into any sort of fossil fuel.
6818 2018-08-07 12:50:50 @GdnPolitics Could it be that Trump sanctions on Iran are really a payback for Mr Putin? Throughout 2014-2017 Russia has only been able to recover cost of crude oil production. Removing Iran oil will put billions more roubles into the Kremlin's coffers.
6819 2018-08-07 12:50:49 Good times. Recall arguing with them that time that what they saw was a product of a good oil price and very soon it would collapse.

6822 2018-08-07 12:50:05 Reconsider coconut oil as a one-stop skin cure-all. Yes, coconut oil is fabulous. But there’s a wide, wonderful world of oils you may miss out on if you never experiment a little. Get to know sweet almond oil, sesame seed oil, marula oil, papaya seed oil…the list goes on!

6841 2018-08-07 12:48:49  I don't even know why we (western countries) even have relations with uncivilized countries (#SaudiArabia). I really think we can do without their oil.

If the power sector has improved; agricultural export increased; non oil export increased why are industries closing and unemployment rates increasing. Government must right people at right places.
6847 2018-08-07 12:48:26 So many people only read the textbook history. They never bother to accept 2 things:
1. FDR's oil embargo was an act of war prior to Pearl Harbor.
2. Japan was ready to surrender. They knew what an invasion would mean.
6848 2018-08-07 12:48:17 I have never seen such a news before. Why ExxonMobil keep spreading such a news even before discovery? And why they are emphasizing the words "Pak Iran border", why not the exact name of the place where the oil is being discovered?
6849 2018-08-07 12:48:11 I just spilled coconut oil all over A Room of Ones Own and the Portable James Joyce , I’m a parody of myself

6853 2018-08-07 12:47:44 Largest sponsored of terrorism is saudi arabia, by far. But oil ;)
6854 2018-08-07 12:47:36 I mean, pushed Pizzagate conspiracy, said the government murdered 3,000 people on 9/11, committed the Sandy Hook shooting and Oklahoma City bombing, he sells snake oil on his website, etc. He is still free to spew his nonsense on a street corner, just not a company's platform.
6855 2018-08-07 12:47:32 lavender + jojoba oil (10 drops lavender oil/1tbsp jojoba).  put on face.  wipe off.  cleans, heals, makes skin happy.
6856 2018-08-07 12:47:23 That doesn't get around my problem: consider e.g. that USA would have harder time even w nationalised oil bc we use so much more of it. Norway's oil pays for Norway and then some, this doesn't necessarily hold for the world's oil re: the world

6858 2018-08-07 12:47:16 There will def be black market smuggling but where do you see that much oil going out of Iran? I can see some smuggling to Syria, a little though Iraq & some through Turkey but logistically snuggling that much oil seems unfeasible to me.

6861 2018-08-07 12:47:02 1) Chavez/Maduro expanded the social safety net by redirecting profits from the state oil company.  There wasn't a dramatic rise in taxes on the rich and, in fact, this reliance on the commodities market rather than taxes is partially to blame for the crisis.
6862 2018-08-07 12:46:55 Had to wake up extra early for my oil change appointment. I’m just going to start riding my bike everywhere now

6864 2018-08-07 12:46:38 @campbellclaret Could it be that Trump sanctions on Iran are really a payback for Mr Putin? Throughout 2014-2017 Russia has only been able to recover cost of crude oil production. Removing Iran oil will put billions more roubles into the Kremlin's coffers.

6874 2018-08-07 12:45:30 @GoldmanSachs: #Oil exporting countries #Currencies such as Norway have not experienced same degree of appreciation as #oilprices. We're positioned for convergence in price action between the two assets, namely, appreciation in #NOK & stabilization or a moderation in oil prices
6875 2018-08-07 12:45:14 We know why you implement these sanctions- if Iran can’t sell its oil, 1 major producer out; your rich donors in US, Russia, Saudi Arabia can jack up prices & make more $. We the people will lose again. You scratch their back, they scratch yours. It’s always about you Don the Con
6876 2018-08-07 12:45:03 1. Be Tony Stark, but be startled by saphires on tuesdays.

2. Eat a lot of motor oil, but have a spaceship.
6877 2018-08-07 12:45:02 You wouldn’t have found canola oil on the shelves before the 1970s. The term, short for “Canadian oil,” was invented by the Rapeseed Association of Canada as a way of rebranding rapeseed oil to make it more appealing to the public.

6883 2018-08-07 12:44:11 Every AU government has screwed East Timorese. I view Howard the worst - he gave them the impression AU would protect them, but waited until after the bloodshed to intervene, portraying himself to the world as a savior when truth he was plotting to steal their oil and gas.
6884 2018-08-07 12:44:06 Definitely worse. Oil is extremely destructive and dangerous chemicals leak into the water supply. That said, blowing them up while under construction helps to prevent oil spills
6885 2018-08-07 12:43:55 I wish they would stop the oil, that way Quebec would have no choice but to buy Canadian
6886 2018-08-07 12:43:54 WTI oil at $69.77/barrel, +$0.76 on expectations of tighter global supply due to revived U.S. sanctions against major crude exporter Iran.

6890 2018-08-07 12:43:36 In the long run it will help foreign auto makers by giving them an advantage in the US while domestic auto makers fall behind AGAIN. But it will help oil companies.
6891 2018-08-07 12:43:22 That is so spot on ! What’s the end game here ? China buys 50 percent of oil from Iran ! Where exactly is China meant to replace her oil from ? Price can hit $200
6892 2018-08-07 12:43:14 Bio oil bagus buat ngilangin bekas luka, bekas jerawat, strechmarks. Tp tidak untuk bekas sakit hati.
6893 2018-08-07 12:43:08 Even if Oil prices collapsed, why did food production collapse, people are now dining on pets. The oil price collapsed to $25 in 2014 and recovered within a year on a side note.
6894 2018-08-07 12:42:47 Showing off what you're going to sell off to Big Oil, Big Mining Interests & Big Timber?
You're still in the running for the title of "Most Swampy" in Trump's "Swamp Olympics"!
Why don't you use the taxpayer $$ you're wasting for Park Maintenance or NPS employee wage increase??!!

6896 2018-08-07 12:42:26 ‘Socialism works! America just made it fail!’ Yes people really think this has nothing to do with Socialism being unsustainable and oil prices tanking worldwide plus the mismanagement of a fat dictator.
6897 2018-08-07 12:42:20 This is coconut oil glow
6898 2018-08-07 12:41:51 Hate when military ppl disagree w you and pull the "I fought for your freedom to say that" line

First of all, most ppl saying this fought for oil resources 

But also...you fought for my freedom to say what I think....so I should respect you by...not...saying...what I think?

6902 2018-08-07 12:41:26 Ask to be seen by a different doctor. Contact talking therapies (doesn't require a referral from a GP). If you have money then seek private therapy. Alternatively, go to Holland and Barrett and ask for CBD oil. It's cannabis oil without THC so it only -
6903 2018-08-07 12:41:17 I was thinking more about blowing up the ones undercontrcution but you do have to way up weather the environmental damage done by an oil leak is worse than it being turned into atomospheric CO2.
6904 2018-08-07 12:41:13 liberal dems are where the kkk, segregation,slavery, Jim Crow, all come from. They did not want to give black Americans the right to vote or own property-it’s always been that way- dem policies have created a welfare state that has been financially crippling in black communities

6925 2018-08-07 12:39:07 Quite. Some have polysorbate 80, some have foetal dna fragments, mercury, formaldehyde, monkey kidney cell fragments, or human albumin. Even the benign ingredients such as peanut oil, egg and milk proteins in tandem with adjuvants can induce lifelong food allergies.
6926 2018-08-07 12:39:07 So the USA and it's partners in the West makes a deal with Iran, but you throw it out like a baby throwing its teddy out of the pram. US word means nothing under your administration. Now watch the price of oil go sky high. Russia will love that.
6927 2018-08-07 12:39:00 Oh really then why you are using dirty oil to destroy the environment!?
6928 2018-08-07 12:38:58 I wonder what would have happened if Chinese, not Western Oil firms were responsible for the environmental disaster in the Niger Delta. Western Media would have concocted an elaborate plot linking the Chinese Government to the "deliberate destruction of Africa's environment".

6934 2018-08-07 12:38:25 This is flawed thinking. The Scandinavian countries are tiny compared to the US and have huge oil reserves (Norway at least). What works in small and largely ethnically homogenous countries can't be applied to a country of more than 300 million inhabitants.

6944 2018-08-07 12:37:37 Harry whats the crack with Iran because we overthrew their democratically elected government in 53 and this sanction crap has been going on ever since they figured it out and had a revolution in the 70's, seems like oil and gas into Europe to me...

6959 2018-08-07 12:35:49 Prez. Trump has warned that any country trades with Iran, will not be doing any business with US. Iran is third biggest oil exporter of India. Hence ban must be imposed on Indian companies trading in US and their employees must be repatriated to their own country immediately.

6963 2018-08-07 12:35:36 Under the current laws we have- had local law enforcement and the FBI have followed procedure he’d never have obtained one, and heather heyer was killed by a psycho who’s a memeber of a hate group. None of those things are related to random strangers assaulting someone

6965 2018-08-07 12:35:06 Oil consumption isn't at 2stroke levels but they do use a bit!
6966 2018-08-07 12:35:00 I have to wonder if these nimrods are aware that Canada's economy is 2 1/2 times larger than SA and we are widely diversified. They have oil, and it's finite.  We absolutely do not need them in anyway whatsoever
6967 2018-08-07 12:34:55 You looking around to see how much of RMMP you can sell off to Big Oil, Mining Interests or Big Timber??!
You're still wasting taxpayer money while scoping out what to sell off.
You're still at the top of the list for the title of "Most Swampy" in the Trump "Swamp Olympics"!!
6968 2018-08-07 12:34:47 Because Canada is beholden to their oil.  Canada hasn’t the energy infrastructure to mouth off to the Saudis.  They can literally crush you with an embargo.
6969 2018-08-07 12:34:42 You don’t fool anyone, schmack, everybody knows you want to help Russians with the price of oil, that’s why you have a one-on-one meeting with your boss putler. They need the price of oil going up and by attacking Iran you just helped with that. Don’t celebrate yet though...

6975 2018-08-07 12:33:54 This is why we need to cut coal and oil out completely and look to things like Solar, Hydrogen and also look into making Cold Fusion work. We also need to seriously start looking to Space Exploration to establish colonies.

7003 2018-08-07 12:31:03 Disagree. Venezuela has had deep divisions before Chavez. But Venezuela under Chavez, when he expropriated the oil field, could rely on some of the cheapest pumped & sweetest crude oil for all funding. Then the oil price tanked.

7112 2018-08-07 12:18:03 The obvious motive is because we can’t rely anymore with O&G income and government have to move into non oil revenue. Implementation of GST being push to suit with gov financial dire need at that time.
7113 2018-08-07 12:18:02 Add the Bush family, Standard Oil, US bankers etc etc etc ... Hitler would have never gotten to where he was without a lot of outside help.
7114 2018-08-07 12:18:00 Continuing to burn coal, oil, and natural gas for energy is like rolling up car windows on a hot summer day.

7116 2018-08-07 12:17:36 I've been saying this for years... YES!!  A couple of things Saudi Arabia does with it's oil profits is to building mosques and promote islam around the world.
7117 2018-08-07 12:17:29 Had you have read all and not one tweet before replying you’d know that.

7119 2018-08-07 12:17:04 Don’t worry, you can still buy their survival supplies and snake oil on the web.
7120 2018-08-07 12:16:44 It could be because my cheese was wet. Or because there was oil and tea and sticky stuff poured in the bottom of my new fridge by a perpetrator who is a dirty as Uwe.
7121 2018-08-07 12:16:34 I referred to both personal experience and evidence that msm do not have issue with this attitude- which further fuels it in those who possess it. Only so much space in a tweet.
7122 2018-08-07 12:16:23 Just one drop of the glistening oil can eventually stain even a soul as stalwart as a loxodon's beyond redemption.　《Loxodon Convert》[NPH]

7124 2018-08-07 12:16:16 Depends on location. Resources are more readily available for some than others. Example, I'm near a major river, hydro is makes more sense. Coal may be more effective elsewhere. Oil rich areas may be good w/ that. Available resources & startup costs are important to consider.

7126 2018-08-07 12:15:43 There is no magic about it. States were already owning salaries and everything was coming down prior to 2015. Jonathan inherited crude oil of over 100$ or almost 100$ per barrel. So kindly do full analysis Or you can tell us how we could have maintained It while oil was falling
7127 2018-08-07 12:15:23 The message from the Saudis is to shut up about your fake "feminism" and take whatever we want to give you, including world wide sharia.   Time for Canada to be independent on oil.
7128 2018-08-07 12:15:14 Fun how you can make numbers tell any story you’d like  In fairness, it says petroleum, not crude oil. We have a lot of refineries.
7129 2018-08-07 12:15:11 U want regime change at any cost, u r destabilising the Middle East which will mean “higher oil leading to inflation, eat into consumer purchasing power & dent the fiscal & current account position of oil-importing economies” - DBS Bank
7130 2018-08-07 12:15:05 “For the lips of the adulterous woman drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil; but in the end she is bitter as gall, sharp as a double-edged sword.”

7132 2018-08-07 12:14:54 How is it that multi-national gas and oil companies are beholden to the US when it comes to sales.  Or are they not?  Just because it comes out of the ground here, doesn’t mean it stays here.
7133 2018-08-07 12:14:44 This month I am doing a 90 minute massage special when you try our new CBD oil enhancement! We have a 12:15 open today and a few openings this week!

7136 2018-08-07 12:14:25 Why should Canada be surprised ? US treatment toward immigrants do not deliver a great image of US around the globe by putting infants in cages and separating from parents...human rights keeps loosing grounds in this country...more respect for oil than human..@HillaryClinton
7137 2018-08-07 12:14:18 Why! did @BarackObama give (USA money) $150 billion to an oil rich  terrorist nation @Iran ,  secretly in the middle of the night. How much was kicked back to Obama. USA want an explanation and the money returned. Iran are terrorists, let them implode. @foxandfriends @OANN @CNN

7139 2018-08-07 12:14:10 Looking to write about medicating anxiety with CBD oil and the effects. Anyone know of any outlets who may be interested?

7140 2018-08-07 12:14:04 My girlfriend was mad when she walked into the house and I was shirtless and covered in baby oil. I said "you always say I never glisten?"

7148 2018-08-07 12:13:26 Why can we not purchase oil from Venezuela?  It would seem they could use the funds .

They are also supposed to be the poster Country for Socialism, mainly Roman Catholic like the French. 

Oh look away ...
7149 2018-08-07 12:13:08 それは大変でしたね…
自分が言うのもなんですが、まつたけさん自身に危害が及ぶような事態にならなくてよかったです…
7150 2018-08-07 12:13:03 Great, can’t wait for oil and gasoline prices to skyrocket. All you’re doing is hurting the PEOPLE of Iran. They’re trying to live in peace and you won’t let them. And the repercussions are NOT going to be “world peace.” A jellyfish is smarter than you are. #Resign Or #Impeach
7151 2018-08-07 12:13:01 It's unlikely we don't have oil. 

What messes up the economy quick is the access to oil. Often your democratic conviction is overriden by external forces.
7152 2018-08-07 12:12:53 Uy baby oil
7153 2018-08-07 12:12:47 No, environmental laws are not to blame for the fires—just the opposite. We know you would love to just get rid of environmental laws altogether to help out your buddies in the oil, lumber, mining companies, etc, but spare us these outrageous lies.
7154 2018-08-07 12:12:46 You don't care about peace, you want to sell oil.
7155 2018-08-07 12:12:38 In the same way they reported the oil spill in the Gulf would destroy beaches in FL far up the Atlantic coast.  Tourism went off the cliff, the damage limited to some on Panhandle, then a yr later, #FNM crying about bad reporting ruining economy.
7156 2018-08-07 12:12:24 Or be born into a rich family and defraud your investors at every turn, run a few businesses into the ground while you escape in your golden parachute- bum money off of Russian mobsters and oil princes that will poison your family if you don’t pay them back... is more the case.

7161 2018-08-07 12:12:04 Thanks for driving up the price of oil even more, doofus.
7162 2018-08-07 12:11:57 @Wizkidayo does your feet smell like hot oil
7163 2018-08-07 12:11:50 No, you want to keep them from selling oil so we can sell more of ours.

7166 2018-08-07 12:11:37 This spat is a good reason to fire up Energy East.  The world can do without conflict oil.
7167 2018-08-07 12:11:36 Dealing with ME countries like KSA is like dealing with juveniles. A tweet about a blogger should elicit such strong reactions from a state is quite amazing and distressing. But the West is equally complicit in creating these franchenstein given their lust for wealth & oil etc
7168 2018-08-07 12:11:34 우정이라는 기계에 잘 정제된 예의라는 기름을 바르는 것은 현명하다.
It is wise to apply the oil of refined politeness to the mechanisms of friendship.
7169 2018-08-07 12:11:32 this dumb bitch bought soft pastels instead of oil pastels
7170 2018-08-07 12:11:31 Ignore him, he is no oil painting.
7171 2018-08-07 12:11:30 I still wonder what I could have done to my granny as a child for her to make me drink castor oil.
7172 2018-08-07 12:11:25 It’s a virtual monopoly (like Bell Telephone and Standard Oil had years ago) - so, different rules apply.
7173 2018-08-07 12:11:24 I don’t know why im up so early but I need to get up and get this oil change.
7174 2018-08-07 12:11:21 Actually Texas produces more oil than anywhere in the world.
7175 2018-08-07 12:11:09 Russias economy is held back by:

It's large reliance on oil

Western sanctions reducing investment

Corruption and lack of institutions that allow people to build and keep wealth without it's confiscation by the state.
7176 2018-08-07 12:11:04 BO did nothing but what? double the debt; man what a genius to have the Feds spend $9 trillion more than it took in. "shovel ready jobs", phew-- glad he was on that. Shaking down BP for spilling oil in the Gulf.. man he's good. BO had no clue on biz, that wasn't his background.
7177 2018-08-07 12:10:55 This is a big issue for us. Tried everything, currently researching CBD oil... 
7178 2018-08-07 12:10:54 When John Bolton says the US does not want to force regime change on Iran, the US wants to force regime change on Iran 

This is a coalition of pressure on Iran from our human rights hating friends in both Saudi Arabia and USA

7182 2018-08-07 12:10:36 Cari rosehip oil or anything yang ada brightening ingredients. Kalau your mom boleh go dgn oil, rosehip oil is like the best.

Kalau tak suka, boleh cari yang ada barley extract, tranexamic acid, pearl extract, alpha arbutin. Dalam bentuk serum boleh, essence boleh.
7183 2018-08-07 12:10:34 I don't have them very often but when I do I like them peeled. I don't throw out the peelings tho, I cook them in some @great_oil with cumin, paprika or chilli powder, great for snacking on

7200 2018-08-07 12:08:17 It is directly related to Socialism. They seized prosperous private enterprise & ran it into the ground. Then they took control of all else as it spiraled downward. Start w/Chávez’s seizure of oil rigs & work forward -you’ll see. Now who would invest there? Govt will take it.
7201 2018-08-07 12:07:36 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.

7237 2018-08-07 12:03:14 Ah cool :) parathas/ puris etc. Can be cooked without oil (kind if like dry roasting?) And kept in the fridge. My mum usually does this when expecting many guests :) 

I wanna try Sudani and other African food. It always looks like I would love it.
7238 2018-08-07 12:03:10 Inflation rate up to 5.7%. World oil prices still high. High correlation. Those excise taxed tobacco alcoholic drinks and oil based like transport elec water and some agri prod. Rice fish meat vege.  Must import and PNP catching eco saboteurs/erring traders

7241 2018-08-07 12:02:54 Hello Anas. You are correct sanctions are mostly symbolic and that countries can get around that-especially oil countries as their product is so needed-importers will help them circumvent-enforcement is futile especially by unpopular Trump and because  are good people
7242 2018-08-07 12:02:50 And derivatives are prefabricated monetary scams that don't actually exist in the real economy but can in fact destroy the real economy. The ultimate snake oil salesman has got the global economy by the gonads. People get dumber & more evil at the top

7249 2018-08-07 12:02:00 They have finished pouring palm oil all over Osinbajo. By the end of this administration, not a single spot of white will be left.
7250 2018-08-07 12:01:45 Gusto na nako inumon ning efficascent oil sa kasakit sa akong tiyan ataaay
7251 2018-08-07 12:01:41 @cafreeland Never thought I'd be thanking you.  Please stay firm on Saudi Arabia. The atrocities committed to women there are horrendous.  And Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan. We have oil. Let's use it. Don't cave....
7252 2018-08-07 12:01:35 I dont know how this people can manipulate and think that all filipinos are idiots. Just admit the fact the china took it for their military positioning not for some oil sway shit you are talking about what they put their is a military base an airfields!!! Idiots!!!
7253 2018-08-07 12:01:34 Retweeted (World_Oil_Price): Today I grew up again. #Oil #Brent 74.73$ (+0.79)
7254 2018-08-07 12:01:29 TDIH: (1996) Oil barge Irving Whale is brought into #HalifaxHarbour, by American tug Atlantic Salvor. The barge sank 26 years earlier.
7255 2018-08-07 12:01:25 Please fall inside the oil well already
7256 2018-08-07 12:01:22 #GENOCIDE in Ambazonia. How can the world stay silent & watch this genocide going on, the work of Paul biya, a 86 years dictator in power since 1982, a personal  friend of Mr Antonio Gutierrez. 
Please say no to genocide in Ambazonia! No to blood Oil no to corruption in the U.N.
7257 2018-08-07 12:01:20 And neither country is socialist in having nationalized the means of production, which seems like a sine qua non. Norway a) nationalized oil b) nationalized German industry after WWII, but its own citizens have strong private property rights.
7258 2018-08-07 12:01:03 Pakistan se oil niklay ga aur America Pakistanion k khoon ka paisa ho jayega.

7261 2018-08-07 12:00:11 we have a full service dept. from oil changes to full rebuilds if you want it done we can do it. 10% parts for vets and first responders. We have a wide verity of consignment bikes check'em out
7262 2018-08-07 12:00:07 Yes, temporary peace can be attained in S. Sudan, if Bashir and M7 agree to tame their egos, UN and USA agree to open cash taps, and China decides to back off  oil production in SS. Short of that, all peace agreements will be like writing on top of water.
7263 2018-08-07 12:00:07 "Ike gave the go-ahead to the Iranian coup. In a brilliantly cunning plan, the CIA successfully toppled Mosaddegh  The CIA then vested the unelected Shah of Iran with total dictatorial power over the Iranian people. The Shah restored oil rights to the British petroleum countries"
7264 2018-08-07 12:00:01 Today I grew up again. #Oil #Brent 74.73$ (+0.79)
7265 2018-08-07 12:00:00 Lots of oil...
7266 2018-08-07 11:59:59 Is he making pancakes in all that oil.? 
7267 2018-08-07 11:59:26 You think 11% of our oil is a big deal?
7268 2018-08-07 11:59:16 So, Quebec depends on Islamofascist Saudi Arabia for oil but blocks the Canada East pipeline from Alberta which would be cheaper and much safer.  Maybe the Saudi war of words and actions against Canada means its time to build this pipeline.#cdnpoli

7270 2018-08-07 11:59:10 BIG MEDIA PLATFORMS have become Thug CARTELS:  What if All Major Oil Companies say we are going to charge $8, a gallon or All Electric Co. say we are charging everyone $200 a month, THIS WOULD BE ILLEGAL COLLUSION BY MONOPLIES! THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE NOW! @Potus ???
7271 2018-08-07 11:58:53 it's not the point, if you know anything about Anglo-Iranian history and relations you'd know all the west wants is their oil and gas and a pipeline under our control into Europe we have toppled legitimate governments to do so.
7272 2018-08-07 11:58:33 What is more interesting is how many legit conservatives are going to tie their wagon to the “slippery slope” of this lying con artist and actual snake oil salesman Alex Jones.

I think it’s an insult to conservatives to call him a conservative...

7275 2018-08-07 11:58:15 we've had enough of mental health BP clubs building oil well platforms that don't produce oil because there isn't any oil, they needed a secluded place to live for their own safety,? I don't know who builds these things.

Check the unemployment trend - he's done nothing special (it has been increasing for years). 

Wages? Compare that to the inflation please & rising oil prices. 

You have to look at the big picture not just small pieces.

7300 2018-08-07 11:55:06 Since this incident I have seen so many Saudis telling things that are totally inaccurate, specifically numbers. They say that 50% of oil imported in Canada is Saudi. Disinformation and propaganda are ruling over there.

7308 2018-08-07 11:53:34 the bypass was originally proposed for conveyance of oil between Ipoh and Port Dickson, so that dangerous cargo doesn't go through KL Sentral and general populated areas. That service has ceased since mid 2008.

7317 2018-08-07 11:51:36 For shiny and healthy hair, mash an avocado, and a tablespoon of olive oil, and rub it through your hair. Wash your hair after 15 minutes

7341 2018-08-07 11:48:18 My guess is they have removed a bunch of the peanut oil (to sell on it's own, good stuff) and have added the palm oil to keep the peanut butter from drying out.

Still, not the end of the world.

7347 2018-08-07 11:47:03 The best peanut butter is 100% peanuts.
If you are to splurge on preservatives all you need is a little salt.
The palm oil is frankly acting as filler.
Ideally there should be a layer of peanut oil at the top too (just stir it in for all the peanutty goodness).

7353 2018-08-07 11:46:16 Interesting that Saudi Arabia supplies Irving Oil with 40% of their oil feedstock. Another example of the need for the energy east pipeline and the importance of getting Canadian Crude to eastern Canada. #pipeline #canadiancrude
7354 2018-08-07 11:46:14 A little wet and soggy here in Concord today. Gradall crew will be installing pipe on Vaughn St. Crews will continue to mow in Collins and we will begin to sweep our oil and chip roads.

7358 2018-08-07 11:45:48 This reaction by Saudi Arabia is self destroying. This news is being shown around the world. It is showing what a poor excuse for a country SA is. It has been politically sustained by the West because of it's oil for years. Another country in the middle east that can do no wrong.

7373 2018-08-07 11:42:59 It's an oil emirate with a sovereign wealth fund. I'm not saying it can't be described as socialist, but it didnt seem to me that it would quite qualify in the sense you meant. Correct me if I am wrong however.

7391 2018-08-07 11:41:12 It's benefiting rich coal and oil company owners (friends of Trump) rather than investing in green energy which, as I've already demonstrated, would create more jobs.

7401 2018-08-07 11:39:40 He wants World peace! (In reality he wants cheap oil...) 

The citizens of this country have to watch this man very closely.  When you corner an animal, they get desperate.... 

Will @realDonaldTrump start a war to gain support for his racist and treasonous regime?
7402 2018-08-07 11:39:31 I think Rudan needs a refund from this snake oil salesmen
7403 2018-08-07 11:39:31 I don't believe it untill I see it happen.. uzmanov won't let this surely??? Also there is some African Billionair in his mid 60's and he's a huge arsenal fan and hates kroenke, he stated that once he finishes some developments of his oil company, he will bid for arsenal

7415 2018-08-07 11:38:08 I’m unsure if it’s the heat or what but the oil production in my face has increased and it’s annoying.
7416 2018-08-07 11:37:55 From the Lucas Oil Stadium webpage it states that there is a "Clear Bag Policy" and no cameras with lenses over 4".
7417 2018-08-07 11:37:38 Hahaha...it’s fine that it’s a concern, but we provided the brand and kind we bought and have proven that there’s no corn syrup, it’s low in sugar, and has sustainable palm oil. It’s like this shit is more important than getting starving kids a regular protein source.
7418 2018-08-07 11:37:05 Nigerian government revenue is largely based on oil sales. unfortunately that dictates a lot of monetary policies and decisions on development that have an effect on other industries. There is potential, however, our government is still too reliant on oil for now.
7419 2018-08-07 11:36:53 We don't have oil here to fund your pie-in-the-sky "free" programmes. Here, we have a very small tax base and a growing dependency on social grants. You want to threaten the very small tax base, and nationalise everything from banks to land. You, sir, are the ignorant one.
7420 2018-08-07 11:36:41 @KTRTRS .... Sir....CGD (City Gas Distribution) is happening event in the Country ..... time has come for Telangana State to  look into options to join hands with E&P majors (ONGC, OIL, IOCL, BPCL) for creation of separate Joint venture for CGD project in our State
7421 2018-08-07 11:36:39 Obviously you need glasses and a hearing aid- liberal ppl are consistently being openly violent against conservatives- it’s been happening across the country- especially in mostly liberal states.
7422 2018-08-07 11:36:39 I just remembered my previous stepdad had me doing all this crazy shit in the mechanic shop we owned when I was 6, mf had me doing oil changes, tire changes, spark plug replavements at SIX Y/O
7423 2018-08-07 11:36:27 Avon’s Skin so Soft oil spray is a bit of a cult product for deterring midges for some reason.
7424 2018-08-07 11:36:23 I have no love for Jones, but shutting down public voices for "malicious lies" will likely lead to all criticism being declared a "malicious lie" and similarly censored. He may be full of snake oil and shit, but like Russia he's effectively now a strawman to justify censorship.
7425 2018-08-07 11:36:18 The fastest path to development in Nigeria na make crude oil finish.
7426 2018-08-07 11:36:08 So all the press releases of say any oil company are heck hospital are that uses double talk are HITLER...
7427 2018-08-07 11:36:06 But Oil has been there with only 2 vice presidens but people life still remains miserable....no single tarmac road or water project being undertaken by the govt. When u add another 3 only the cartels who control oil will have their profit cut...

7429 2018-08-07 11:35:51 They successfully got everybody to quit wasting so much paper and forgot that paper biodegrades at the same rate as leaves-even waxed paper, and especially previously recycled wax paper-while plastic will still be around in the same billion years it took for the oil to form. 
7430 2018-08-07 11:35:34 Protesting what?

Tax cuts
Employment 
Record low food stamps
Strong military
Self sufficiency 
Less dependence on foreign oil

What!
7431 2018-08-07 11:35:32 you fry eggs with oil. we aren't fucking no more I'm sorry Mbali . 
7432 2018-08-07 11:35:14 Let me tell you what happens next 

First iran responds by increasing oil prices 
Then big oil companies charge more...earning trumps friends more money 

This isn't stupidity.....just selfish

The oil hang our ears
7435 2018-08-07 11:35:00 Oil prices are too high, and it's your voice that matters the most.
7436 2018-08-07 11:34:47 Farmers that view EU standards as being unscientifically based are no different than oil companies that support denial of climate change. US farmers that want to export to the EU need to meet EU standards. Simple! Would the US agree to import goods that didn't meet US standards?
7437 2018-08-07 11:34:42 Baby gotta get an oil change, and a tune up soon
7438 2018-08-07 11:34:41 Panicked about losing the gas and oil ?

7443 2018-08-07 11:34:05 "I just performed a life saving surgery."
"You monster! How do you know the morphine used was sourced from poppies grown in a country with a strong human rights record!"

Palm oil is a valid concern, so they can fuck off and deal with that while your busy with feeding children.
7444 2018-08-07 11:33:38 With butter,MCT oil and cinamon is the best.
7445 2018-08-07 11:33:32 Anything from America is going to be the best quality, use are miles ahead of everyone lol. Do you use pure cbd oil?

7447 2018-08-07 11:33:25 Brazil closes its border with Venezuela becaus so many Venezuelans are seeking refuge from the failed socialist country. Venezuela is hugely oil rich country but socialism has squandered its wealth. Tragic, but that's what socialism does-no matter how rich your country.
7448 2018-08-07 11:33:22 I need a oil change so bad but don’t feel like being in there forever 
7449 2018-08-07 11:32:32 CBD Oil
7450 2018-08-07 11:32:30 China have bought (HAVE) more 3 (THREE) TRILLIONS USA $. USA DEBTS are 21 TRILLIONS $.
THEREFORE will be well if China will be invest into Russia instead usa.
Namely China must invest to Gas, oil, steels, agriculture... of Russia.
7451 2018-08-07 11:32:19 Iraqi Kurdish leaders must abide by US sanction on Iran so stop  smuggling oil to or through IRAN على قادة اقليم كردستان العراق  تطبيق العقوبات الامريكيه على ايران  وايقاف تهريب النفط الى او من خلال ايران
7452 2018-08-07 11:32:06 He will keep screaming into the dark tunnel of his mind, hoping to sell sawdust pills and snake oil.
7453 2018-08-07 11:32:00 Maybe you don't even need to oil up.

7461 2018-08-07 11:31:01 Most morning when I’m late it’s because I’ve rubbed down in oil while air drying and dozed back off NOT because of Starbucks or my smoothie bowl run
7462 2018-08-07 11:30:58 Many So called "Kafirs" as you put are working in Saudi/Iraq/Malaysia/Qatar/Dubai....... so on !! hope you accept .. and btw the way the oil you using is also anti national one !!

7468 2018-08-07 11:30:01 trus dia coba pakai olive oil. Kelihatan mendingan. Bekasnya juga agak memudar
7469 2018-08-07 11:29:51 イベントキャラにしてはまあまあって感じ
7470 2018-08-07 11:29:34 Considering how much Putin wanted Tillerson to be SoS, this would fit. The reliance won't stop with oil, other goods will be imported and their sub quality product will do lots of harm in America. I'm connecting it to all the deregulation in all safety government offices.
7471 2018-08-07 11:29:29 interest of any one. It conserve its oil resources and work for the good of middle east on one hand and the rest of humanity on other. Iran can play an important role in restoring peace in middle east which was shattered by George Bush. World should punish him for the blunders
7472 2018-08-07 11:29:29 Yes keeping Irans oil off the market so your buddy putin won't have any competition
7473 2018-08-07 11:29:25 I love using all natural body products. African black soap, shea butter, sunflower seed oil, charcoal for my teeth. I really be in this bitch feel like Mother Nature
7474 2018-08-07 11:29:20 which is why I recommend that before creating a taxi firm, you should at least build your own oil refinery, rig and pipeline or your own nuclear power plant, mine or solar power plant, rubber plantation (you don't want to get locked into tyres), automotive industry etc etc.
7475 2018-08-07 11:28:50 Gasoline prices will rise by 40% in the coming weeks and your oil friends will thank you while the rest of us suffer. You’re a disaster
7476 2018-08-07 11:28:47 New polling shows nearly all those with an education disapprove of Trump. His support comes almost entirely from non-college educated whites. His support comes from those without the knowledge base to make educated decisions. Like a snake oil salesman he cons the easily conned.
7477 2018-08-07 11:28:42 let’s compair presidential actions against the Russians?  Trump has imposed the strongest sanctions ever, he screwed up their big oil deal with Germany, he threw out over 50 Russians diplomats? Obama said “Cut it out” to Putin!US Cyber Security  to stand down! How weak Obama is!

7480 2018-08-07 11:28:25 every day i think about climate change and ecological collapse and every day i walk past a model of an oil drilling platform on a plinth in my department. feeling disorientated. am i wrong to think geology/earth science needs to address its conflicting purposes?
7481 2018-08-07 11:28:24 Need to educate owners/drivers up here in Bradford of diesel engined vehicles that adding cooking oil to each tank full is harming everyone and the vehicle's as well.
7482 2018-08-07 11:28:12 Now would be a great time for Canada to get on w/ developing their native oil industry and sticking by the demand.  It would create lots of jobs too.
7483 2018-08-07 11:28:10 I made pesto last night with basil, spinach, kale, parmesan, olive oil, walnuts, and a little lemon juice. It was a hit with the whole family!
7484 2018-08-07 11:28:05 China is a major importer of Iranian oil. It isn't just about Iran. China won't buy US oil, they will go somewhere else. My guess is we will see their tariffs go up again, as a response.
7485 2018-08-07 11:28:03 How do you do that when other governments only want to get involved when there are mineral or oil they can explore. Look into a book called war is a racket. The man that wrote that book won 2 CMOH and saved the US from a coup... Little know history of this country.

7491 2018-08-07 11:26:51 I try to be ideologically consistent- I give trump credit when it’s due for policies I agree with-& I criticize policies I don’t- I know from experience that liberals can be rabid-you may not be but, many can & are! I’ve seen it firsthand more than once.

7496 2018-08-07 11:26:32 You're right the Scottish people having to pay £30bn in decommissioning costs would be a terrible burden for a nation of 5m people. At least we agree on something. How much of remaining oil is burnable without irreversibly damaging the climate?
7497 2018-08-07 11:26:26 Nah too far i rubbed my eye forgetting i put coconut oil on my lashes nd now my eyes stinging lit fuck can this day get any worse ?

7504 2018-08-07 11:25:10 an economy can and will sink with or without oil. tourism is hardly a good pivot because it is susceptible to perception and or global polity. venezeula sinking can be attributed to poor governance and the war on communism. south africa can survive land reform but will not....

7507 2018-08-07 11:25:00 @theresa_may how can UK people sit& watch this grave undemocratic situations that has been going on in Nigeria? Why is UK government  pretending as if they don't what has been happening 2 their colony is,is UK government against or for Nigerians citizens?or is just about our oil?
7508 2018-08-07 11:24:55 For this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: ‘The jar of flour will not be used up and the jug of oil will not run dry until the day the Lord sends rain on the land.’ ”

7511 2018-08-07 11:24:22 These are not honorable men. They really thought the Ukraine model of assigning one “friend” the steel industry, another #PayToPlay big oil, their relative “private security forces” was something they could get away with - while they skim billions off the top. Nope. Not leaders.
7512 2018-08-07 11:24:18 For months I have been tweeting that America will be dependent on Russian oil. Sanctions will be lifted off the RU for that.
7513 2018-08-07 11:24:08 Most of the people who have grabbed hold of climate change and greenhouse gases, pollution, oil dependency - they have another motive, and their motive is to attain the appearance of virtue without having actually done anything virtuous.
7514 2018-08-07 11:24:06 Have you seen the documentary “ The Pruitt Igoe Myth”
It’s all about the auto industry, suburban white flight and how highways and the burbs were created by the government to help their cronies in the auto and oil industry - worth a watch - on Netflix
7515 2018-08-07 11:23:53 $440 million  always should be. This is disgraceful. Directors are mining and oil company mates. Close to corruption.

7518 2018-08-07 11:22:58 So we can look forward to the US lifting sanctions off Russia to import their oil? Was this the new design? SMDH
7519 2018-08-07 11:22:45 I actually don’t do any kind of rally & deplore racists & racism of any kind-I also don’t like being physically threatened for not wanting socialism/communism that is the DNC platform @ this point. I oppose both the death penalty and abortion-not a fan of killing. (Libertarian)
7520 2018-08-07 11:22:44 This just helps Russia. Russian companies will continue doing business in Iran as if nothing happened at all—in oil, gas and nuclear energy. They have this advantage over the Europeans who, like Total or Airbus, have major businesses in the US.

7561 2018-08-07 11:15:37 I cut them in half, drizzled olive oil & garlic salt and baked them until the outside was real crispy. I’m assuming that’s the most basic way lol

7566 2018-08-07 11:14:54 American sanctions on Iran went into effect today,90 days after the U.S. withdrew from the nuclear deal,unless Iran complies far-tougher steps will take effect on Nov. 5, when the U.S. will cut off Iran's oil exports.
7567 2018-08-07 11:14:35 Even if you say so. Is there a country to follow? If the Japan has obeyed, the United States will guarantee the oil of the minute, isn't it, president?

7577 2018-08-07 11:12:53 2. In the 1970s Scotland discovered oil which would have made us one of the richest countries in the world. &which I'm sure we would've been happy to share with the poorer areas of the rUK.  Instead what happened was the oil wealth was stolen,used to line the pockets of the rich
7578 2018-08-07 11:12:33 It's lines like that which make you realise he's just free associating. I don't think he's nuts, or an ideologue, he's just an old fashioned snake oil preacher who doesn't believe any of the guff he sells to his marks.
7579 2018-08-07 11:12:07 They are heading back in time to wait for the oil to run out, or the rest of us to not need it as much.

7585 2018-08-07 11:11:04 No. They’re not hungry. They have a lot of potatoes, yams and plantains etc. Why would they be hungry? They’re successful farmers remember. All they need is oil for frying their food and they’ll eat. That’s why Sai Baba is building refinery for them

7610 2018-08-07 11:08:03 The only real reason for going this way is to increase the selling number of fracking oil. This decision is a comercial one not a politcal. At the end you drive up the oil prices in generell and the economy is going back. You are the best deal maker ever

7624 2018-08-07 11:06:25 Still Russia and China side with Iran -- The sanctions may bite hardest in November, when the US blocks Iranian oil sales.

This could halt about half of Iran's exports of some two million barrels a day, although Iran may look to China and Russia to keep its industry afloat.

7633 2018-08-07 11:04:21 Best estimate, is that US oil sanctions will only take about 300,000 bbl per day of Iranian oil off the market.
*A good amount, but nowhere near shutting down Iran.

7652 2018-08-07 11:01:50 Never mind that oil prices have gone UP recently .....
7653 2018-08-07 11:01:21 Its not because of patriotism. Its because foreign oil is cheaper. Our oil is too expensive to extract. 
Just like cheap Chinese plastic, people dont want to pay more for things. Doesnt matter where it comes from.

7661 2018-08-07 11:00:40 True, but when repeating what's been tried before hasn't worked, then it's time to try something else. Russia, China & others will keep the regime afloat. China needs the oil while Russia enjoys the weapon sales.

Also - and this may come as a bit of a shock - Alex Jones isn't really a "conservative." He's a con artist hawking overpriced snake oil to the gullible.
7669 2018-08-07 10:59:29 Now yr talkin! It turns out that the only reason they want to fix the planet is because we stole half the oil that they were planning to harvest, and now they have to wait another 300 million years to get a decent yield.

However, stronger sanctions related to oil exports are not due until Nov. While Brent approaches $75/bbl, the market is still around $5 below last month’s peak.

7777 2018-08-07 10:40:36 So Iran is going to block Strait of Hormuz? 
US should provide oil to those countries which are trading with Iran to fulfill their oil requirements.... Otherwise don't mess with Iranians

7790 2018-08-07 10:39:12 Playing the blame game on oil masks the underlying problem of the Venezuelan economy. That's economic mismanagement. By the way Norway, Saudi Arabia among the few are net oil exporters. Why didn't they face the same catastrophic challenge as Venezuela?

7794 2018-08-07 10:39:04 Actually the Scottish taxpayer & Scotland’s resources do more than well enough on their own. It’s a known fact that Scotland’s oil funded Thatcher’s deindustrialisation program. Whisky alone is a large %age of UK food & drink exports. Do some reading son, it’ll do you well.

7834 2018-08-07 10:31:36 Whilst the oil price also contributed to the meltdown, the leftist economic policies further collapsed the economy due to massive capital flight. Oil price has now recovered.

7859 2018-08-07 10:28:33 Don't agree.Have heard more US bashing from our Government & media then this grave concern for a country we continue to enrich by buying their Oil.

7863 2018-08-07 10:28:16 The only way for the Saudis to make money on that will be a massive oil price spike caused by conflict. Backed by the UK of course. No wonder they don't want #Corbyn in any power to prevent that.
7864 2018-08-07 10:28:01 So do it for oil,some from back handers,lobbyists.Many Pollys support terrorists just like this current gov who support Isis, arm the Saudis right wing Wahhabism, arm Syrians Islamic terrorists to overthrow Assad.Then after that import lots of Trojan horses who kill our people.

7868 2018-08-07 10:27:27 Just do business with them! Within a year the US would dominate every aspect of their economy : oil, gas, power generation.  To achieve what you clearly want - do it by trade domination not sanctions. It’s how we brought down the Iron Curtain imbecile !

7879 2018-08-07 10:25:42 Yep. Speaking to a fundy recently who asserted he wasn’t concerned about global warming. He insisted the oil was put there by god for mankind and he was going to burn it without restriction. 
7880 2018-08-07 10:25:41 Our military is always advancing, and if we are the largest oil producer why are the gas prices so high and why are we relying on another country for oil, only thing Trump has done is destroyed relationships with alias and increased hate and violence in our country

Lefties make the dumbest comments
7902 2018-08-07 10:21:17 if youve watched in the heart of the sea...for the longest time humans sourced their oil from whales...only for the industry to be disrupted when they found oil underground...and now the new 'oil' from the sun.....are we due for another disruption?

It's not right but it is fact....

7911 2018-08-07 10:19:51 That would be Saudi Arabia that does that. We are giving Saudi weapons so that they give them to Al Queda to use against Iran as a proxy and our soldiers in Yemen. Now we are going to force up oil prices so Saudi ISIS has more money.

7914 2018-08-07 10:19:32 Hi there, please be honest. We know US does not care about the peace in the Middle East or actually anywhere else. Most certainly, if Iran decides to give all its oil to US, they would be the a democratic country. :) 

PS. USA is the only user of atomic bomb in the histroy.

7971 2018-08-07 10:10:59 “Oil war”? What’s that supposed to mean?

This silly story about Iraq being “about oil” is nonsense. There’s a global market in crude oil, and except for local subsidies (or eg between Venezuela & Cuba) everyone gets access to the same world supply at the same price

7987 2018-08-07 10:08:21 Interesting post, as always. Indeed, CB triggered the rise of the #USD and thus, the #oil crash in 2014. However, the correlation between oil & the USD turned positive in 2017 as US #CrudeOil exports rose. The major risk for #WTI seems to be a #recession now.

7999 2018-08-07 10:05:58 They need their oil, more so than their monies. No one cares about the monies because the US can borrow that from the Japanese.

8007 2018-08-07 10:05:28 I agree. One of the key selling points is "not a bookies". Avoiding the cheap pushes would build credibility.

Plenty of neutral news will cause the pumps. You would never see an exchange saying "Oil! Oil is the one to buy today!" 

Exchanges are supposed to be honest brokers.
8008 2018-08-07 10:05:25 No one was listening to him. He sounded like a tin foil hat whack job selling snake oil pills. Now he looks like he has some legitimate claims on censorship. They just made him a lot more powerful, not the other way around.

8013 2018-08-07 10:05:05 The growing anxiety in oil markets over reimposed US sanctions on Iran may see crude prices going $ 100 per barrel or even beyond in near future. I do not know how it is going to help the ordinary American consumer.

8029 2018-08-07 10:02:48 You do realize that you aren't a contestant at the Miss America Pagent; right?
But not doing business with a country that does business with Iran.
Will that mean you will no longer purchase oil from the middle east?
8030 2018-08-07 10:02:34 You would be bankrupt now relying on the price of oil only for being part of UK, remember SNP said the oil revenues would make Scotland land of milk and honey what a shock when the price tanked, you are pushing against an open door the rest of UK want you to be independent.

8032 2018-08-07 10:02:22 It's all about driving up the price of oil to profit his major benefactors.

8037 2018-08-07 10:01:47  Typical. Move away from figures - nowt. HW was complaining about kids in social media at 8. Estonia are teaching kids code at 5. The huge energy oil & gas companies are heavily involved in AI/robotics. It’s called vision. They know where we’re heading.
8038 2018-08-07 10:01:01 We are still waiting, but if traditional political stances are to be trusted, we will not see much support for Canada against the Saudi. UNHRC and western democracies have no values when oil money is concerned.
8039 2018-08-07 10:00:59 And that suits the Saudi oil and Russian gas exporters just fine.

8050 2018-08-07 09:59:32 It is obviously a very weak economic policy if the price of one commodity can bring an economy to total failure. Most of the other countries around the world seem to have survived 'the oil price crisis' quite well.

8056 2018-08-07 09:58:32 I’m a staunch believer in free speech, but he was inciting hatred, encouraging it in others, and abusing people who’d already been victimized in the worst possible ways…to sell his stupid snake oil supplements. He was dangerous.
8057 2018-08-07 09:58:23 @realDonaldTrump you are wrong here as the advancements in MPG technology pays for itself as the growth is exponentially expensed out over time and helps the USA to become gasoline and oil indepentant as we are seeing
8058 2018-08-07 09:58:11 The Oil isn’t Scotland’s. It’s a shared resource. Should they go independent which isn’t independent they join the EU, that oil gets divided up between countries. If Scotland is as wealthy as you suggest, why does it need the Barnett Formula? Why does it have a deficit bigger
8059 2018-08-07 09:58:00 They can have their students and keep their oil as far as I’m concerned. They can also fuck off and keep their craziness to themselves.

8064 2018-08-07 09:57:27 Berapa nak jual tea tree oil tu?
8065 2018-08-07 09:57:14 Not really - let steak come to room temp & season, heat grill plate, flip em every 20 seconds until cooked to your preferred temp. shave parmesan with a peeler over rocket, mix lime juice and olive oil and dress, toss to mix through, and serve!

8078 2018-08-07 09:55:17 Why would it? Enlightened Western states' laws are not predicated on imaginary prophets nor their imaginary teachings laid down in a book. Saudi Arabia has nothing to bring to the Western world, other than oil.  And their paralympic team.  Who are all presumably thieves...

8082 2018-08-07 09:54:20 Nigerians have the genes for Alzheimer's. but do not often get it due to their diet, which is high in plant based fats. The trick is natural fats, not processed fats like yellow oils and spreads. Coconut oil definitely helps, as does avocado, olive oil (raw in salads) et al.
8083 2018-08-07 09:53:49 I dey tells u bro...ur head get oil
8084 2018-08-07 09:53:46 Yep, at least they are working, not like you lazy arabs. Our country doesnt sell the oil which is found by Britishs. We produce to live;)
If Britishs hadnt find the oil, you poky desert people were still riding camels to sell some date of palm.
Thank to britain for life you live
8085 2018-08-07 09:53:36 Oil Price?

Oil has been incredibly robust considering increased production fron US - and helping its exports on energy with liquid gas 
The Iran sanctions - will oil exports and implications on buying nations 
China main market for Iran 

Only increases  Tariffs as beating stick
8086 2018-08-07 09:53:16 A disaster for the environment: 
"...the boost to local palm oil consumption will hasten Indonesia's already fast spreading deforestation..."
A huge menace for orangutans too.

8094 2018-08-07 09:51:51 Again you are displaying your ignorance. The EFF was not in existence in 2010. So which EFF took students to Venezuela in 2010. A youth delegation went to a WFDY conference in Venezuela and that time the oil revenue was providing quality free education and healthcare for all.

8108 2018-08-07 09:49:48 I agree with Leophan. Political discussion isn't about reinforcing your own views. It's about softening other's view.
At best he's driving people away from conservative and libertarian views. 
At worst he's a snake oil merchant causing harm to others through conspiracy theories.

8114 2018-08-07 09:48:09 There was a global decline in oil production and the price of crude oil under the socialist government, which inherited a skewed economy of capitalist greedy kleptocrats, was reduced by more than 50%. Of course a prejudicial reading of Venezuela will reach wrong conclusions.

8120 2018-08-07 09:47:41 China can take over Iran. I'm sure the oil will help pay for a proper form of government that can purge those Islamic turds from existence.

8129 2018-08-07 09:46:32 That’s right. David Dein was the first to propose the idea of having Stan on board, because Stan told him that he can finance the club to compete with oil money. The board and Danny Fiszman in particular, were against the idea. Hence ensued a board room rift and Dein exited.

8138 2018-08-07 09:44:49 Chavez and Maduro inherited an economy that largely revolved around oil. Saudi Arabia and almost all Emirates’ territories diversified their economies and created Sovereign Wealth Funds, which earn them foreign currency incomes from different investments all over the world.

8163 2018-08-07 09:40:52 Of course that is true. Since 1800 there had been but a handful who actually did advance this science of Unani Medicine.After the death of Hakeem Ajmal and Hakeem Saeed, sadly there has been no advances at all in this field. Snake oil vendors have destroyed it's future and charm.

8174 2018-08-07 09:40:06 There’s a lot of misconception around about beard oil and what it does. Beard oil mainly acts as a moisturizer and conditioner for your beard and the skin beneath your beard. This keeps your beard in mint condition; soft smooth and shiny. And it smells great!

"Then we could say to #OPEC, if you don't stabilize your prices, ten years from now we don't need your oil. Use it on your salad dressing" 

What struck me was his emphasis on price volatility, not price level.

8277 2018-08-07 09:25:17 That’s a very simplistic and decidedly wrong reading of Venezuela’s economic problems. Venezuela under successive capitalist governments didn’t diversify its economic base and largely depended on oil exports. When the global oil price collapsed, the entire economy was affected.
8278 2018-08-07 09:25:17 Your country want to get oil for free.This is not going to happen. Do not call for IMMEDIATE release for terrorists and criminals who are subjecting  to fair court. You will find many people in Africa need your help for justice, but they do not have oil. Native Canadians need it
8279 2018-08-07 09:25:16 No it isn't as simple as that. Ask Standard Oil or AT&T.
8280 2018-08-07 09:25:15 Or how the myth of Cda as a socialist country under the medicare umbrella while the rest of the corp indulgences go unnoticed like corp media saturation captured CRA institutions owned by oil banks favoring interest rates for corps billionaire elites.
8281 2018-08-07 09:24:48 Jones is a snake oil selling con man, a fraud and a moron. He is not a conservative, does not speak for conservatives and has nothing to do with conservatism.
8282 2018-08-07 09:24:23 No..u r focusing on the South. The main issue is that the whole U.K. economy is tilted to the south..of each constituent country. ( Aberdeen is an anomaly due to oil). Maybe learn from continental countries and address regional diversification and growth plus infrastructure

8285 2018-08-07 09:24:05 Going by the history of oil geopolitics, the possibility that Balochistan will become a bigger theatre of conflict than it already is, given the new oil finds, seems quite real.

That's why he replaced Rext Tillerson with @SecPompeo. In upcoming #Energy_War he will understand why he should not #mess with the #Oil! 
#IRAN is able to save #OPEC and it means end of US oil plan.

8369 2018-08-07 09:09:05 because, to me, the value of making progress not by being funding by criminality and oil is huge. tbf - man utd haven't done that either. but progress by developing players and selling them (like Suarez and Coutinho) and buying a better squad is how a club should be ran IMO.
8370 2018-08-07 09:08:11 Whenever it can be taken from the ground at a profit the oil industry will do so. Stop blaming government for not financing a losing proposition.

8377 2018-08-07 09:06:37 Hard to see the point of this discussion. In a best case scenario a total shut down of all oil production in Norway could delay temperature rise by a month or two, assuming none of the 1.8 mbpd were replaced - which is unthinkable. Climate depends on peak demand, not peak supply.

8555 2018-08-07 08:33:15 No it did not peak in the 70's. What you and others ignore is as technology advances does our ability to find, get and refine oil.

8583 2018-08-07 08:28:28 Most of Kuwait, UAE, Brunei, and Qatar's income is based on the price of oil. 

San Marino has 33,000 people. Luxembourg has 600k. All of the countries with a higher per capita income have less than 10 million people.
8584 2018-08-07 08:28:26 Similar to illegal bunkering in oil producing States, but they are treated differently. With license factories & modular refineries in host communities, such illegalities will be history. The People will be gainfully employed & the community will protect their resources better

8598 2018-08-07 08:26:00 Our revenue dropped drastically, our foreign reserve was at a record low of 20billion dollars, meaning we had basically nothing to fall back on during this world oil crisis, so whether gej made it back to power a not, a recession was going to hit us real bad.

8609 2018-08-07 08:23:30 I agree with you that the harvey/ wallerstein explanation is two-dimesional. These 2 books are very good. Bottom line: the us stumbled onto a solution to high oil prices that also solved the 1960s urban riots and set the stage to the subprime crisis of 2008

Give me any other source of revenue and i’ll sit aside. What about Inventions? Professors? Doctors ? Presidents? CEO’s of multinational companies?
8613 2018-08-07 08:22:55 I actually don't understand why KSA has its knickers in a knot about this. If Venezuela and other OPEC countries had good relations with USA KSA would be the one getting crushing sanctions 24-7. Only popular because of oil.

8621 2018-08-07 08:20:49 First off, Nigeria has a monoeconomic structure whi ch means they have just one major source of income which is oil. In 2014 there was a major decline in world oil prices which wasn't caused by the prevent administration because it was a global issue.
8622 2018-08-07 08:20:03 Important to note that the Italian government is not anti-capitalist as such, but a coalition of racist snake oil salesmen (Cinque Stelle), and racist neo-fascists (Lega).

8625 2018-08-07 08:19:48 You realize that this whole thing happened because your gov thought they could tell us what to do. Don't you get it? No one tells us what to do.

8672 2018-08-07 08:09:55 Got that right.  Saudis have proven oil reserves of 268 billion barrels. (Enough for 37 years of US consumption at current rates).  But it's gonna get way hotter than it already is.

8855 2018-08-07 07:32:52 Ah, you've fell into an old trap. You don't need a new chain, you just soak the old one in white spirit, clean and oil the cog, and then resign.

8860 2018-08-07 07:31:44 Yes, well not Iran, of course.  We have enough oil for our needs.  We just lack infrastructure, and effective leadership
8861 2018-08-07 07:31:41 Scotland’s temp is good, not too hot & splashes of rain, in years to come we’ll be a much coveted country, when other’s countries temperatures become too hot to survive.

8864 2018-08-07 07:30:56 Oil has been a weapon for decades. We have the technology to leave oil where it belongs...in the ground. We shld have long moved away from its use. Only greed keeps it in play. So we continue to be held hostage to its use.
8865 2018-08-07 07:30:51 It's very rare that we get an owner who pumps money in unless we get Saudi ownership tbh. Kroenke as it stands has not been all bad, we just haven't got oil money like City or Chelsea so it looks awful.

8871 2018-08-07 07:30:02 @cafreeland @JustinTrudeau  Using a page from Donald Trump's playbook will always come back to bite you. Twitter diplomacy never works. Since we're in KSA's bad books now, let's go all the way. Cancel the armoured vehicle deal, stop oil imports. Revisit Energy East.
8872 2018-08-07 07:29:59 Because Americans, on both sides of the political establishment lines, are sheep with shit for brains for the most part. A bunch of Saudis fly plains into our buildings, so lets invade countries that aren't growing enough heroine and ones that are selling oil in Euros not dollars

8880 2018-08-07 07:28:45 Shes right to say Trump is loathed and call the media out on certain stat basics like employment which needed debate. Independents are fed up with both parties but will go Dem just to right the ship. Free? Yes, Cut military, boom! Tax the 1%. And oil co. Cut Congress wages etc

8882 2018-08-07 07:28:24 Affluenza, breathing in gas fumes, used to getting what they want due to oil, is it really a surprise they act like that?
8883 2018-08-07 07:28:12 I work in the oil and gas industry. So less of the "swampies" nonsense. Taking a risk in a densely populated area for a couple of hundred barrels per day seems reckless to me.

8909 2018-08-07 07:24:40 @GMB CBD (cannabis oil) is a prescribed medication and has just been legalised in Britain for one (possibly two) particular cases. So unfortunately for Richard he should be doing more up to date research.

8916 2018-08-07 07:23:29 Chavez was not socialist, despite his claims. They were briefly progressive, but the take over of the oil companies was incomplete and simply set up another bourgeois elite. Worker ownership of oil fields and reduction of all politician pay to that of workers never happened.

8979 2018-08-07 07:12:06 Difficulty in the analogy other than value extraction is that unlike oil data is not scarce, it has many inputs and outputs, means of production is getting easier, reproducible… etc

I only think that other than perhaps licensing, taxation is problematic.

8987 2018-08-07 07:11:08 Sure Iran sucks but they are having conflicts of their own with the US. Russia and China want to sell arms to Iran and especially oil as far as Russia goes. In 20 years a new World plan could be put in place but after 20 years of peace Iran may not want to have the bomb anyways
8988 2018-08-07 07:11:05 I learned this the hard way too omg I think it's because bbcream tries to moisturize you as well so if you have primer that cements your pores you'll just end up looking like a oil slick

9047 2018-08-07 07:00:47 おそらく、オイル語の o もラテン語の hoc に由来すると想像できる（c の音が脱落した）。この代名詞 o と人称代名詞の主格形 il が結びついて「肯定の返事」o il を構成していたので、元々 oil というのは2つの単語から成立した語であることがわかる。ちなみに、oy, ouy という表記もアリ。

9129 2018-08-07 06:47:38 Let’s boycot all these Arab Islamic gulf countries. We don’t need them, we have a lot of oil and gas in Alberta and Canada.

9131 2018-08-07 06:47:08 It's called sweet oil, a high quality, low sulphur oil.  If it weren't for that, I doubt the Saudis would be treated with such kid gloves.

9146 2018-08-07 06:45:00 Chicken, cut to strips, sesame oil, and any herbs from your spice rack, doesnt matter, just rub them in well (place sideways to get nice marks). Serve in a bowl on top of boiled rice and peas (cooked in the rice, just throw in a few handfuls).

People will assume its gym food.

9158 2018-08-07 06:42:02 I know someone else has mentioned this but give CBD oil a try. You can get it from Holland and Barrett. Just a few drops twice a day. Did wonders for our mini schnauzer who inexplicably became almost semi-paralysed and in pain. Within days she was fine again. It calms too.
9159 2018-08-07 06:42:02 That's correct, but the budget includes a multi £Bn fiscal transfer under Barnett, last year's was £15bn. We are spending more than our revenues here in Scotland can support. It is worse since the oil price collapse, and Salmond promised we'd see income in the £8bn range by now.
9160 2018-08-07 06:41:57 would be funny if Canada upped its oil production...
9161 2018-08-07 06:41:18 #SpacedOutRadio @SpacedOutRadio this is not a both sides issue. NYT does actual journalism. Alex Jones peddles blatant propaganda and snake oil. Also, YouTube is a private company and doesn't have to give him a mouthpiece.

9208 2018-08-07 06:34:36 Its about the quality please recheck @hallaboutafrica tweet SA wine quality better.
What does Nigeria export known for oil and where does it export the oil.

9210 2018-08-07 06:34:24 2016 Canada imported ~87000 b/d of oil from SA.  AT $50 US/b that's about US$4.3M/day.  Where would eastern Canada get their oil should the Saudis cease shipping?  Canadian oil?

Sounds like she struck oil in the end.

9227 2018-08-07 06:32:27 True. Not looking to prop up dictatorships in Iran or Venezuela. Or Russia (you left them out somehow). We don't need to import any oil. Making a point that we don't need the Saudi regime. They are just one of many oil producers countries can choose from. World passing them by.

9230 2018-08-07 06:31:29 But one of the best things for sleekness is Hair oil. I use one by windle & moodie. It’s essential oils for hair. Little goes a long way! Also I love living proof thickening cream. I think it also helps blow out straight + sleek 
9231 2018-08-07 06:31:29 I sense it would be an easier sell (certainly to B.C., perhaps to the rest of the country) if the pitch were "We're committing the country to meeting our Kyoto targets by ensuring that the oil stays where it is, but this costs money, we think it's worth it, and here's why."
9232 2018-08-07 06:31:16 No dairy, no fried food, no sodas and lots of water & rosehip oil for your face each morning. Eat lots of veggies. That's it.
9233 2018-08-07 06:31:10 Because the media is.... Wait for it... *The enemy of the people*
9234 2018-08-07 06:30:37 Venezuela can overcome it’s economic hardships, with an economic plan to diversify it’s economy, rehabilitation of it’s oil producing infrastructure&it’s people working together. 
External support in part of countries friends, necessary.The US must stop it’s economic sanctions.
9235 2018-08-07 06:30:37 Arable yields are likely to be down at least 20% ( assuming a normalisation) of weather this year. Buy rapeseed oil futures ; needs planting now and ground too hard and dry for germination.

9243 2018-08-07 06:29:10 Lol! So if it was exams time, I’d basically burn the midnight oil. But also, study leave babe. Cos you work right? Use that. Otherwise, for normal studying, I’d get home as early as possible then go from 6-8pm or 9pm then close the books.
9244 2018-08-07 06:29:01 for the times you don't want to practise weight lifting, Circulon is heavy enough base for even heating, non stick but without the Teflon flaking worry. needs way less oil than cast iron/le creuset
9245 2018-08-07 06:28:35 @realDonaldTrump is such a piece of garbage. People are dying in history's largest wildfires in CA, and all he can do is blame our "environmental laws". He is working his own agenda to please big oil companies who stroke his tiny little penis. #Trump #TrumpTinyPenis

9257 2018-08-07 06:26:31 Of course, if you watched the great Robert Redford in Three Days of the Condor, you might come away thinking it was about oil in South America, or that Chinese spies might be involved, not just CIA (or if you read the books).
9258 2018-08-07 06:26:19 We felt the need to break up AT&T and the Bell Companies. The power that Google and YouTube have today makes MaBell look like the corner candy store compared to Amazon. 
It’s no longer just dominate market share. It’s todays Standard Oil. In our free market economy, it’s monopoly
9259 2018-08-07 06:25:48 Buy hair wonder Natural oil and the Shampoo works amazing
9260 2018-08-07 06:25:31 Yeah, that's the reason. Nothing to do with all that oil your friend likes burning . . . it hasn't been under 100 where I live all summer, 55 years in California. Your lies don't make it "normal"

9267 2018-08-07 06:24:44 Use of Palm Oil, burning habitats for animals. Ask @Anchi46 for details.
9268 2018-08-07 06:24:33 Saudi Arabia expulsion of the Canadian ambassador for criticism of how they treat women and advocating for “women rights “ is prove of how male chauvinist is it’s society but also of a sticking foreign policy...Iran &Qatar will export 10%oil Canada imports from Saudi...!

9270 2018-08-07 06:24:26 Tea tree oil helped my acne clear up
9271 2018-08-07 06:24:18 Olive oil too. Heard it from the grapevine 
9272 2018-08-07 06:23:55 So, we would reimburse oil companies tens if not hundreds of billions dollars and then pay the interest on that debt how?
9273 2018-08-07 06:23:41 Discovery of oil reserves, Naya Pakistan on the horizon, Ummah looking towards our nukes for protection, ISPR preparing a troll army in the name of 'internship', what's not to be positive about m8?
9274 2018-08-07 06:23:34 The hardcore leftist liberals like antifa use violence.
9275 2018-08-07 06:23:25 Most guys will Read this and Get soy Oil on themselves & Taking….
9276 2018-08-07 06:23:19 AND NEVER EVER EVER!! Put coconut oil on ya face! I did it to see for myself...face gonna look like the cannoli stuffing
9277 2018-08-07 06:23:10 DFA Secretary @alanpcayetano confirms President Duterte has approved the formation of a technical working group that will study the feasibility and legality of a possible joint oil exploration with China.
9278 2018-08-07 06:23:04 I may have cannonballed my finger in a lil hot oil tonight but I’ll take a physical burn over a verbal burn any day of the week, oh yes I will
9279 2018-08-07 06:22:58 Ah nice Luke, I've not tried the liquid form, just the tablets.
Omega 3s are an absolute daily essential, so whilst there's doubt in the cardiovascular side of things at the moment, that doesn't mean they're not beneficial...though I've started using algae oil instead recently.
9280 2018-08-07 06:22:51 We have an inversion of values.Hard work and innovation are values.If we are seen to denigrate the same,what are we saying as a society? @SafaricomPLC is nowhere near such companies as Standard Oil that were punished for abusing their dominance in the US.
9281 2018-08-07 06:22:44 So does this mean we stop paying $Bs to SA for oil?
9282 2018-08-07 06:22:40 If you can EXPLORE how much OIL does HINDustan produce generally.

You can also make a quick 30% return on this in next 6-8wks
9283 2018-08-07 06:22:39 Saudi Arabia only cancelled new trade deals. I bet those 100,000 barrels of oil per day we've been importing for the past few years from them don't stop. This is just a chance for Turdeau to score some quick political points. Smoke and mirrors.
9284 2018-08-07 06:22:18 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, what will you do about OIL prices?  You once said “as interest rates go down, the “Cartel” OPEC raises the price of oil.”  Now interest rates are rising and the price of oil is skyrocketing.  Please tell me you have a solution to the monopoly OPEC?
9285 2018-08-07 06:22:14 Boris Johnson. Fake Brit.

Diss Muslims & encourage UK to despise all Muslims - to help those who wanna steal Muslim oil and land

Next step in justification of destroying now obviously inferior people to steal their land & oil?

Demonise Russia for getting in way of land grab!
9286 2018-08-07 06:21:53 How about a fetish for feeding wet oil spills under cars, #sexy
9287 2018-08-07 06:21:26 Please explain to Nigerian about your involvement in the oil deal you, oil goddess Alison and Aliko in last Administration.
9288 2018-08-07 06:21:24 Coral. Grew up on the coast and the coral was destroyed due to oil spill. Would love to study them and maybe learn how to better protect what's left of it.
9289 2018-08-07 06:21:16 Like I’m constantly having people tell me to try marijuana and/or cbd oil and 1. I live in Texas so a doctor can’t advise, prescribe, or monitor this and 2. With cbd I would still have to talk to a doctor because my body is a disaster stop pushing your hippie cures ugh.
9290 2018-08-07 06:21:16 No habiby remember the plan : rub oil on your beard every night and come back like iron man.
9291 2018-08-07 06:20:20 I wonder if the u.s is also behind the drone attack in Venezuela, Venezuela has tasty oil reserves and they've been known to have messed with South and Central America before i believe.
9292 2018-08-07 06:20:18 Oil/milia seeds kat pipi pun boleh gak, bergantung kat individu. Lgpun yg Sarah punya mmg dia kumpul kat bhg pipi bawah mata. Nnti cari serum yg ada retinol/retinoid/vit A, vit E, pakai before tido.
9293 2018-08-07 06:20:18 t@RealAlexJones I feel bad for you ALex. Without youtube, it will a lot harder to sell that snake oil to all of those half-wits who buy into your crap. I guess this is a victory for gay frogs everywhere! #gayfrogpride

9296 2018-08-07 06:19:55 The question is, of course, whether it's a business the federal government ought to be in at all even on a temporary basis given the environmental impacts.  I wonder if it wouldn't be a better course for the feds to just *buy* the oilsands and keep the oil in the ground.
9297 2018-08-07 06:19:52 Infowars pushes snake oil via extreme conspiracies that have awful real world consequences. Don’t lie about it.
9298 2018-08-07 06:19:42 the only item i have is their oil paper with sekaiho's pic on it hahahhahha,,i use cosrx instead 
9299 2018-08-07 06:19:40 Heading to Kileka at former  Super Oil Station to train  family Members in Book Binding. Those interested can contact us now

9304 2018-08-07 06:19:18 #Crude, today's price is not what I needed.  Price should drop to get that uptrend.  Right now the dates of the uptrend has been push back to 2 days.  #oil #opec #aramco
9305 2018-08-07 06:19:16 Canada doesn’t purchase oil. Private companies do. I suggest you direct your questions to the Irving’s.
9306 2018-08-07 06:19:14 So no more SA oil?
9307 2018-08-07 06:19:09 オイルはギトギトというイメージを拭い去ろうか。時にはサラサラし、時にはギトギト。オイルはいつだって君のそばにいるのさ。
9308 2018-08-07 06:18:43 Why then do we pay them $Bs for their oil and not use our own?  Are we stopping the importation of SA oil?
9309 2018-08-07 06:18:31 the U.S and its lly detroyed libya that wanted to make its own monetary system for Africa...,iraq for its rich oil money.., syria for the oil too. and whos next? because of controlling world economy? quatar maybe too..
9310 2018-08-07 06:18:04 But foreign interest groups keep our oil off the market by paying special interest crusaders to keep our oil landlocked. I'm against that. Imagine how long the KM protesters would last in SA. They would be shot and buried in a week. But we buy oil from them.
9311 2018-08-07 06:17:53 she lyin’ oil won’t go there! if it wanted to, it would be there now.
9312 2018-08-07 06:17:45 but i literally have both of those laying around lmaoo trader joes, man. 

picked up some aloe vera (in the bottle, not the straight from the plant kind) and a few small packets of coconut oil around here.

ooh do i mix these together and put them on my face? on some mask shit?

9314 2018-08-07 06:17:40 Oil?
9315 2018-08-07 06:17:35 you can just use an oil that dose not smell like patchouli. You can use any food-grade oil, may i recommend canola or safflower? Or look at the packaging for your scented version and discern the base oil.
9316 2018-08-07 06:17:15 This admin's objective is steered by petrol peddlers who feed oil addiction, squelching alternative energy. Underneath the yet-to-melt Arctic are oil fields right between Canada and Russia. I think 45's been totally set up & manipulated, which was easy between the ego & low IQ.
9317 2018-08-07 06:17:10 Canada bets big on biodiesel to limit costs of oil imports

9321 2018-08-07 06:16:36 Why then do we pay them $Bs for their oil, rather than use our own?

9324 2018-08-07 06:16:17 I know! It wasn't just spaghetti by the way - it had olive oil and fried courgette through it. Strictly the pasta should have been primi and the chicken secondi but I just put it all on one plate.

9326 2018-08-07 06:15:53 If the pressures on the inflationary front are worrisome, there is little good news to be had from the international scene. Oil prices are steady right now, after having done the damage in the recent past but what is troubling is US-China trade war

9328 2018-08-07 06:15:12 DSTV why not. You could hike the fees more and maybe remove championships league. This is Nigeria, a country fantastically corrupt. Those concerned will even kill their fellow countrymen to keep licking the oil from DSTV.. And that's how to fight corruption

9330 2018-08-07 06:14:59 Canada has more or less same proven  oil reserve as Saudi Arabia .
9331 2018-08-07 06:14:47 They can flood the market with cheap oil when in Canada the price of oil has to be above 45-50 bucks a barrel to make money because we can't ship enough to be competitive globally. If we could put as much oil on the market as them they would lose that edge. We have enough to

9334 2018-08-07 06:14:28 Your Islamic "Iran" was created by the British in order to prevent the "godless" Soviets from reaching the Persian Gulf and becoming a permanent superpower that controls over 60% of global oil. Should they'd wished Khomeini would have never left France instead thrown in jail.

9340 2018-08-07 06:13:57 Yes! The monopolies must punish anyone who disagrees with the leftist political class. The oil companies, the cable companies, auto industry, insurance, etc. must all PUNISH DISSENT! We must have a totalitarian police state for the survival of our representative republic!
9341 2018-08-07 06:13:48 Not sure why Canada spends billions on oil imports when they own 13% of global oil reserves....and that's third largest after Venezuela (20%) and Saudi (18%).
9342 2018-08-07 06:13:41 You see, it can now be said that

9346 2018-08-07 06:12:39 Palm oil should be banned. The amount of deforestation taking place in Indonesia is criminal.
9347 2018-08-07 06:12:18 When a foreign firm,company etc  invest in our communities , we are so quick to persuade ordinary pple to cramped the street and applaude. Does that help increase the price of oil or the amt of CSR benefits that accrue to local communities? We'd passed  this stage
9348 2018-08-07 06:12:10 Answer is to:
1) find/use  alternative energy or
2) refine own oil for use in Canada - should not have let US companies essentially “own” energy resources.
9349 2018-08-07 06:11:32 On bright side, every event like this IS changing hearts and minds. Disgusting leftists lose votes everytime. #MAGA
9350 2018-08-07 06:11:30 Not sure what you are getting at. Opec controls the oil market like a monopoly. I don't like that. It's a free market in name, but the Saudis are so rich off their abundance of oil that they could care less what the global price is. The make money at 15-25 bucks a barrel, so

9365 2018-08-07 06:09:57 Canada doesn't buy Saudi oil. Privately owned refineries by oil that makes them the most profit. For a group that loves the free-market, you sure do whine a lot when it actually doesn't donwhat you want it to do. You can't have it both ways, Ed. So do you want an NEP then?
9366 2018-08-07 06:09:52 Good news for pti and Pakistan. One of the biggest oil discovery in the world. Good times ahead. Near iran border. Plus off shore gas drilling going on for oil and gas.

9401 2018-08-07 06:03:03 Canada should also be placing sanctions on them, instead of selling them weapons and armoured vehicles.  I am glad we spoke up, but we need to put our money where our mouth is.  If it weren't for SA's sweet oil (needing less refining), no one would tolerate their actions.
9402 2018-08-07 06:02:41 I’m experiencing hair loss but it’s potentially because you have a higher testosterone level after coming off the pill. I’d get your blood checked. I’ve had to go on the pill to reduce it. I’m still working out what helps but I’ve heard coconut oil and regain work wonders.

9417 2018-08-07 05:59:56 Give Somalis a right to enroll national army, give them a fair deal on their oil as 5% is a ripoff and give them government positions.

9421 2018-08-07 05:58:59 As we discuss human rights, let us not forget Canada has been silent about the massacre and displacement of the Rohingas. I guess because they are poor and have no oil as a tool of foreign policy.
9422 2018-08-07 05:58:49 YouTube have some documentary’s on him.They called him a “dictator” because he was constantly attacked by the rich and elites in the state of Louisiana for going against Standard Oil in the state, and built the bridges and roads with free text books for kids in schools.
9423 2018-08-07 05:58:32 If anything, I think things would be much better if the US didn't have as big a presence in the Middle East as we do... it's not really necessary except for the oil companies to make more money...

9430 2018-08-07 05:58:06 My feeling is, if he didn't commit, incite, or threaten violence he should be left alone.  I'm betting, in this instance it is his insane level of support for the Trumpster.
Now...if you want to pop him for something, maybe take a closer look at the snake oil he sells.

9439 2018-08-07 05:56:12 @ezralevant @SheilaGunnReid is it possible the LPC has engineered this spat with the Saudis in order to justify blocking Saudi oil imports, creating an oil shortage in Canada (since Energy East is dead), driving up fuel prices and causing less use and a drop in CO2 emissions? 
9440 2018-08-07 05:55:45 Your ignorance is astounding but understandable. You prefer to lie yourself than to admit you were sold a big dollop of snake oil from an orange charmer. Honestly I pity you, for you shall be the worse for it. Your President does not care about you or the country. You were told.

It was NOTHING compared to the discrimination & abuse I got in US Family Courts. People wouldn't believe.
9445 2018-08-07 05:54:54 It’ll limit the supply of oil. One of Russia’s biggest, if not largest  export is oil products. So the price of oil is about to get a boost.

9449 2018-08-07 05:53:45 @samtripoli @TinFoilHatCast @eddiebravo
The renuable oil theory is that it isn't created by fossils, aka not a fossil fuel. The alternative is that the crust of the earth contains billions of billions, infinite amount of microorganisms that create oil as a waste product.
9450 2018-08-07 05:53:19 Oil is everywhere still to truly get away from oil you would have to grow your own food make your own clothes and so on.Please don't misunderstand me I would like to live in a more pure world with less plastics and better lasting products.

9461 2018-08-07 05:51:34 How much oil is left according to you sources and how long will it last? In early 70s, the world had about 3billion people and far less cars, surely you cannot just ignore the amount consumed by cars and industries since 1972, even if you believe oil is an infinite resource.

9524 2018-08-07 05:42:54 Ye, Geoff, I think that is totally it - taking the opportunity, doing risk management. Seems so simple. If someone has a direct stake in oil or gas I suppose I get the reticence. But for everyone else the down looks horrible and the upsides could be many.

9676 2018-08-07 05:16:18 I never liked lipstick either, it cracked my lips & discoloured them, but i recently started coating my lips with virgin coconut oil when i start getting ready, at the end i wipe it off with cotton and some water based cleanser, apply lipstick & it sits so well!
9677 2018-08-07 05:16:16 Which oil company?
As for the Wheat Board, perhaps it's time to re-evaluate that, along with all other Supply Management. I consider it anti-free market. It should have never existed in the first place.

9685 2018-08-07 05:15:06 Maybe now the Saudis are being giant dicks we can get Alberta oil flowing Eastward in Canada. Not that I care about the Saudis and how they treat their own people but why buy oil from them?
9686 2018-08-07 05:15:00 They have an innovative technology which recycle’s plastic into oil where it originally came from. You are a responsible business leader, with a long list of admirers & followers. Therefore, I request you to study about this startup or any other such technologies and promote them
9687 2018-08-07 05:14:50 This is not the most straight forward debate. I ask you if they are making so much money for the country, why is a free cup of rice and. 2 litre cooking oil special? Why do they get free seed and fertiliser yearly. Command agri and input program take a billion, do we get such bek

9701 2018-08-07 05:12:18 Of course. Most content of Rasam is actually Water. It has Tomatoes, Tamarind, Coriander, Garlic, pepper, Dried Red Chillies, and many spices. Oil is only used for Tempering with spices. This is an awesome for Digestion.  Some even make Daal Rasam.
9702 2018-08-07 05:12:05 Coconut oil ahoy!
9703 2018-08-07 05:11:56 yeah I still have my curls too even tho I never wear them natural. I only bleach my roots once and when I first bleached my hair I used coconut oil masks like once a weak to get it back to an okay texture lollll
9704 2018-08-07 05:11:51 Technology may become a great unequilizer if it provides all factors of production. After all, it's the tech companies that concentrate all wealth today. Way beyond oil or pharma or anything one can name.

If he is just selling a product that can actually help people, what is the problem again?

People sell product everyday. If he isn't hoodwinking people, this whole beef smacks of envy.

9782 2018-08-07 04:58:09 The pipeline is to bring oil products to more customers than just the USA (which we need to do). The carbon tax revenues that the provinces collect are supposed to cover the investments you mentioned..
9783 2018-08-07 04:58:07 I've seen multiple "why don't we just buy all our oil from ourselves" tweets today, as if this is somehow a new idea that had never occurred to anyone in history before, and maybe there are reasons that doesn't work?

This is a Trump talking point repackaged. Be smarter.
9784 2018-08-07 04:58:02 Double cleansing tuh bersihin muka pake 2 type product. Yang pertama yg oil based dulu, bisa make milk cleanser viva, di oles di muka tuh trus diemin bentar abis itu usap pake kapas, setelah itu pake cleanser yang water based yaitu micellar water, usap juga pake kapas
9785 2018-08-07 04:57:40 Different types of oil, though, isn't it? Different ratios of volatiles?
In any case, ultimately we are going to have to learn to manage without fossil fuels, and the sooner we do that the better our chances of surviving what we have done to our planet already.
9786 2018-08-07 04:57:38 Too bad that he drank the Trump snake oil and is now reaping the painful consequences like so many others.
I wonder if he is still a supporter? Would love to know what he's thinking.

9828 2018-08-07 04:51:09 Hello...I think it's too late, this should have been done years ago....US is becoming, if not already , energy self sufficient, and actually is selling some of the oil it imports( at great discount)from Canada. Thx Soros !
9829 2018-08-07 04:51:03 Also the time when her uncle was out shootin' possum with one of his many assault rifles and he struck oil and moved her into a Beverly Hills mansion to get her married off so she could change her name and stop embarrassing her family. Ok...I may have added the last part myself.
9830 2018-08-07 04:50:55 I HAVE BECOME ALEX JONES. LOOK AT HOW RED MY SKIN GETS. BUY THIS FUCKING SNAKE OIL.
9831 2018-08-07 04:50:53 I also prefer castor oil, argon oil and teatree oil.

9833 2018-08-07 04:50:32 Thanks to my online artist tip jar I’ve been able to purchase new oil paint, palette knives, & a painter palette. Not to leave out my friends who sent me a stack of canvas! Thank you to the generosity of my friends, my mama, & even a total stranger over on twitter. 
9834 2018-08-07 04:50:31 funny no one said anything until now. I said a week ago he was leaking oil. but that's okay this is a "playoff" team. this game is on the manager. poor ssubstitutions. the only thing knapp has done consistently is lose his helmet after every 1st swing and miss. again 2 runs
9835 2018-08-07 04:49:58 “why are you anxious?? just take your cbd oil” IT DONT WORK LIKE THAT SUS
9836 2018-08-07 04:49:47 It wasn't directly caused by socialism, it was more caused by the national economy being entirely based on a single export commodity that is historically volatile in price, combined with incompetent people being funneled into the state-run oil company via cronyism. Do research.

9850 2018-08-07 04:47:58 I use peppermint oil - 1-2 drops under the tongue and in the diffuser. Dried ginger. I avoid dairy on injection day. If that doesn’t help, I have an ondanestron prescription. It might be worth getting your bloodwork done to make sure liver and RBC count is ok. #methotrexate

9860 2018-08-07 04:45:51 The same could be said with coal, gas and oil. They buy politicians to influence legislation to benifet their cause. Ever since you guys backed Citizen United. Those monopolies and now even forgein investors are making legislations for their business and not the US citizens
9861 2018-08-07 04:45:50 Oil prices rallied Monday as markets braced for the reimposition of US sanctions against Iran.

9881 2018-08-07 04:41:41 The club library in OIL campus (previously Brit owned Burma oil company), guwahati, was fascinating. It was up in an attic with iron winding staircase and rows of glass covering leather bound books. Recreated much of Blyton with an aura of mystery, danger & charm for a 12yr old.

9885 2018-08-07 04:41:34 Donald J. Trump lies more than any U.S. President in history! He also is more ignorant of the functions of the US government than any president in history. He should be peddling snake oil, not running our country!
9886 2018-08-07 04:41:27 I don’t support this. Dominguez was a starter coming up. Stamina should not be an issue. I get the “longer season”, but it’s not like Dominguez has been over used. He is just leaking oil. He’s not pitching well at all lately. Slider is absolutely worthless right now.

9888 2018-08-07 04:40:53 I understand the ways of tyrants, like American leaders ... one tactic they use is war initiation, they ignore peace offering, then; to make it obvious that they are only interested in going to war, and seizing all of your countries natural resources (which may be oil).
9889 2018-08-07 04:40:49 You must be so naive to think my country will be in “grave danger” if we don’t have any oil left. It’s enough for me that 1.6 billion muslims when they want to pray they put their faces to Mecca city in KSA. We are the capital of Islam. We don’t need oil to be strong country.

9906 2018-08-07 04:38:55 My biggest complaint about that meal is the grease. Cooking oil, butter, and cheese.
9907 2018-08-07 04:38:48 Also make sure the tortillas are maize. White ppl will swear they’re called taquitos and flautas are made with flour. it no one calls em that in Laredo, back where I’m from. Also don’t deep fry em, just lightly crisp em. Peanut oil is best tho.

9919 2018-08-07 04:36:30 There's a portion of the political spectrum that loves to demonize corporations, and oil companies in particular. That wouldn't phase me. But the people who are quick to blame the oil companies NEVER acknowledge how fantastically beneficial FF's have been for humanity.

The difference is 
I worsted so much money on skin routines tsa batho yeses
9950 2018-08-07 04:30:05 Even worse if you get massage oil into the mix.
9951 2018-08-07 04:30:00 It should be the case due to the Oil Deregulation Law. It should spur competition. But what happened was the reverse. Naging cartel. Prices for one became for all.
9952 2018-08-07 04:29:52 Canada  doing right and good for people of Saudi Arabia, where as USA always supporting Saudi Arabia just because of Defence supplies and Oil

9954 2018-08-07 04:29:27 mom noticed a bunch of scabs on me in this crazy woman covered me in all of oil! she said something about a flareup of mites. What in the world is all of oil and why do mites not like all of it?!
9955 2018-08-07 04:29:27 Well id prefer it say 'platanos' but its a lovely instructional on a great dish.

Wait COOKING BANANAS!? That just don't sound right.

Also as far as sauce goes I love to fry up minced onions and fresh garlic in olive oil. Toss in some lemon juice at the end. Then drizzle.

9958 2018-08-07 04:29:02 anyway just got the idea to massage the really painful spots with peppermint oil and it seems to be helping some. also got more water and cantaloupe?
9959 2018-08-07 04:28:59 At this stage of my recovery, nerves are re-attaching themselves and boy, that's a shit ton of fun!!! Zap! Zap! Zappity-zap random stabby pains. 

I need sleep, but even the THC oil isn't helping tonight. #crymeariver
9960 2018-08-07 04:28:23 I guess Human life is cheaper than Oil

9964 2018-08-07 04:27:31 “The eff have birds ever done for ME? Can I turn them into OIL or FOSSIL FUELS?”


9965 2018-08-07 04:27:24 I’d suggest Sendayu Tinggi (both Tea Tree oil and Argan oil) or Becca if you look fot high end primer. Jangan beli Benefit! So small not worth it
9966 2018-08-07 04:27:13 I certainly wouldn’t be quoting him. Studied him at school, atrocious man. Used to kill people who didn’t vote for him by making them drink bottles of castor oil
9967 2018-08-07 04:27:12 gotta oil the wagon first 
9968 2018-08-07 04:27:11 I remember I was almost tackled to the ground by a preacher and all I wanted was prayer. Like idk why he felt the need to bring out the oil and sheet for my ass but I was NOT feeling it and he made me lay down. I was so over it
9969 2018-08-07 04:27:07 So, I may have missed a few things, but does this whiteboard say that God is involved in the Russian collusion plot now?
9970 2018-08-07 04:27:04 If you’re into Oil diffusers and oil blends .. listen up... cedar wood mixed with Geranium is so bomb , knock ya out like a baby

9979 2018-08-07 04:26:11 Laughing in pain. Ended up almost burned my hand with heated vape oil.
9980 2018-08-07 04:25:16 Well done for speaking out against no brainer Saudi hypocrites who wants their hunan rights protected while visiting different countries but don't know the meaning of it in their own....you see oil is so thick that it has to be refined..
9981 2018-08-07 04:25:14 wonder who gets cheated on more niggas in the military or oil field workers
9982 2018-08-07 04:25:02 Came here for this
9983 2018-08-07 04:24:59 Try to spry your hair with apple cider vinegar before shower, from research I found out that it helps with decreasing the oil in the hair
9984 2018-08-07 04:24:42 *dips entire body in cbd oil*
9985 2018-08-07 04:24:42 Once we rescue her, you owe me a frosty mug of oil!
9986 2018-08-07 04:24:38 The vision on uae and ksa is to improve other sectors to be a base as income other than oil. Most projects have already started. We build cars, airplanes parts and more. You can search about it.

9989 2018-08-07 04:24:24 わかる
9990 2018-08-07 04:24:19 YW! The TJ's instructions say to use a nonstick pan, but I used a cast iron skillet with a bit of oil and it works great. The marinade caramelizes without burning. When it's done you could deglaze the pan with a little water for a pan sauce to drizzle over the steak.
9991 2018-08-07 04:24:14 I use argan oil. How do you like castor?
9992 2018-08-07 04:24:01 It is so sad and pathetic that thousands of Nigerians die yearly from treatable and curable sicknesses and diseases in the world’s major oil exporting nation
9993 2018-08-07 04:23:43 It’s not an oil. It’s more like a resin. Anyone who’s seen it, tasted it, chewed on it knows that “oil” is inaccurate.
9994 2018-08-07 04:23:43 Great, look forward to seeing the results soon ! These are water in oil droplets right ?
9995 2018-08-07 04:23:40 巌窟王強かったよ………っていうか監獄塔普通に巌窟王で全部クリアできたし………
9996 2018-08-07 04:23:32 Why does @eBay allow InfoWars to sell its snake oil on its platform?
9997 2018-08-07 04:22:37 Nah, calm down.  We have enough supply to buffer this and many more shocks. 

Price of oil is artificially held up by OPEC production cuts of 2017-2018. Prices were lower before sanctions were lifted by Barack.  Lots of wiggle room.
9998 2018-08-07 04:22:29 Iya pake cleansing oil aja
9999 2018-08-07 04:22:27 "In my case"

10006 2018-08-07 04:20:41 Canada is an amazing place filled with amazing people. I hope the next response from Canada would be to say "We only buy Oil from Countries who have the same ethical and moral standards as us & we're going to build a pipeline to the  east."
10007 2018-08-07 04:20:26 i always see the same woman completely covered in bright fabrics asking for peppermint oil on the side of highway where no cars can stop. today i saw her on the bus
10008 2018-08-07 04:20:01 African black soap + Witch hazel or apple cider vinegar + vitamin E oil + Shea butter = .... just thank me later  much appreciation
10009 2018-08-07 04:19:47 I had 2 makeup free days and somehow got a zit?? This hoe is sizzling in tea tree oil but like WHY.

Crisco oil
10011 2018-08-07 04:19:27 SA complains that we shouldn’t complain about their society by complaining about ours. Circular stupidly. But... good riddance. If we buy oil from them we could get it somewhere else.
10012 2018-08-07 04:19:12 オイルの気持ちにもなってよ…
10013 2018-08-07 04:19:00 Do you mean like Obama did? When he stood in Iraq and said, "We were never here for the oil." Or..."We will end the wars..." or "We will close Guantanamo..." or "Sure...we tortured some folks...but..." Ya mean like that kind of Military-Media-Industrial-Complex BS?
