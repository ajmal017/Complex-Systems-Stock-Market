16 2018-08-21 23:57:10 That’s a fair assessment. Personally I’m going to be building a crypto position (mostly BTC) over the next year or so as a hedge.

#XRP is in the "fight you" phase w/ the larger crypto community & in the "ignore/laugh" phase in the general investor community. The real battle begins when they start fighting...

73 2018-08-21 23:52:50 The problem with crypto currencies is new ones are starting all the time. That’s diluting the market for them continuously. If you don’t like the dollar, which is getting stronger by the way, get gold, at least it will always be worth something.

137 2018-08-21 23:42:18 Certainly, if you figure it would help get the fundraiser exposure. Also, is there some way you can enable Canadian dollar donations? The USD donation form is not letting me put my Canadian address in, and crypto isn't really practical for me at the moment.

148 2018-08-21 23:40:15 Contributed margin on soda is miniscule.  Would rather sell a $6 pint that costs $1.50 to pour rather than a $2.50 soda that costs $.15.
149 2018-08-21 23:39:51 #LocalTokenExchange is one of the unique project that currently exists and has so much potential. They are a crypto exchange site. This is unlike any other projects 
@Local_Token
150 2018-08-21 23:39:36 why do I always feel like I'm about to get a serious roast on @Crypto_Bitlord and end up getting roasted by Chewbacca ??
151 2018-08-21 23:39:25 Ragnar, you’ve been a huge inspiration to me in the crypto space and I agree with you on principle. But, this fight is here and now, equally important but more immediate. Besides Ver is a con and BTrash is going into the toilet eventually, using it to win here won’t stop that.
152 2018-08-21 23:39:14 So is bullwhale the hero of $crypto now? $BTC
153 2018-08-21 23:39:03 Smart man! Followed him as well
154 2018-08-21 23:38:59 ....wrapped in a correction
155 2018-08-21 23:38:38 Wow!!! That is just great, who thought that 1% a day isn’t good enough???
156 2018-08-21 23:38:31 $ostk such a shit show. I was a sucker to buy it right after the last crypto surge and obviously sold it for a big loss in the trough before the earnings surge.... but at the end of the day, happy as hell I don’t own it at these levels.
157 2018-08-21 23:38:30 Robbie Rotten's demise is gonna hit the crypto markets hard.   These 20yr olds lost the shirts off their backs and now they've lost a childhood icon.
158 2018-08-21 23:38:25 Time to buy a fook ton!
159 2018-08-21 23:38:16 Were back on crypto lol
160 2018-08-21 23:38:07 You guys are by far one of the worst banks @wellsfargo it’s just unbelievable.. can’t wait for crypto to go mainstream so you guys can go fly a kite somewhere
161 2018-08-21 23:37:46 That will be a crypto fund , its just tokenized in order to raise money but nothing related to blockchain.  Tech people are different from financial guys. In this case , it would be less attractive for them. Especially, in a bear market.

166 2018-08-21 23:37:13 Well the tricky part is that not all nazis identify themselves as such. Some, crypto fascists, masquerade as people who aren't fascists. Others lack the self awareness.

But would a nazi by any other name fash as much? If it quacks like a Hitler...
167 2018-08-21 23:36:36 That’s fucked up doc!
168 2018-08-21 23:36:21 i am the most BULLISH mother fucker that i know.

but 100k? for the first time in my crypto life i just have to deny that.
169 2018-08-21 23:36:09 I still have a large sum of money in crypto. PROFITS.

176 2018-08-21 23:35:43 So torn about this. You have to be rich to be an accredited investor, which is one of the few ways one can grow wealth. But the same rules that prevent high risk investments would have also prevented the type of speculation that many that hedged on crypto are suffering from.
177 2018-08-21 23:35:36 Yes they do, the main purpose of the futures is to hedge holdings, most likely from mining.
178 2018-08-21 23:35:16 Sounds like the crypto community needs to step up their game
179 2018-08-21 23:35:14 This makes me feel better about crypto than . . . almost anything I've head yet.
180 2018-08-21 23:35:10 I just keep losing followers.. must be because I'm here for the tech not day trading or shorting.  Just hold multiple large bags of solid projects.

So i do some math about "small % profit"
So if you trade every day and earn 1% that is not easy as you all think.
1. 1000$ every day for 365 you will earn around:37783$
2. next year budget almost 38k and every day 1% that is 1435770$
211 2018-08-21 23:31:01 Shocking, isn't it? I couldn't believe how many of the "investors" were desperately throwing their money at crypto at the height of the bubble. I kept pointing out the idiocy of it to many people, none wanted to hear the truth.

299 2018-08-21 23:17:23 There’s also a clear crypto->hip-hop parallel—mixtapes and turntablism are the musical versions of forking.
300 2018-08-21 23:17:18 Definitely
301 2018-08-21 23:17:13 I have about 47 dollars worth of crypto, hire me.
302 2018-08-21 23:17:13 Should have bought spankchain....
303 2018-08-21 23:17:10 It is. The mortgage rates are increasing. And not even slowly. Sub prime rates are climbing. Bank loan rates are increasing. Problem repaying Credit card debt commercials are non stop on the tv and radio. How do people not see these patterns? It’s the same pattern over and over
304 2018-08-21 23:17:09 do you know him or what
305 2018-08-21 23:16:53 Alby is definitely onto something with these insane sub threads

307 2018-08-21 23:16:27 If we compare crypto blockchains to gaming platforms, #TRX is like PS4, while #ETH is like PS1. We wouldn't be where we are today withou the advancements of ETH, but to continue using it would be silly for anything except nostalgia purposes. #thefutureofcrypto #trx20

310 2018-08-21 23:16:17 Whether the crypto is a scam or not, is simply too early to tell.
311 2018-08-21 23:16:17 Lol might as well crypto Homer and crypto Matt groening
312 2018-08-21 23:16:17 おっと、それはrarepepeだな。カエルの絵札を交換するのに使うトークンだ。CounterParty上で取引できる。絵札を集めて何が面白いかって？昔は俺も集めてたんだが、何が面白かったのか今でもよく分からんな…なんであんなに熱中してたんだろうか…

ん～
314 2018-08-21 23:15:34 I thought you was smarter than that Ethan 
315 2018-08-21 23:15:31 Nice one dude. Great to see you doing what you love. You guys should think about accepting crypto for tickets/albums. HMU if you want to find out how easy it is!
316 2018-08-21 23:15:09 In crypto? That would be volume analysis.
317 2018-08-21 23:15:06 It’s good to be.
318 2018-08-21 23:14:52 I was going to read through tweets anyways but like I said I heard a lot of the same

321 2018-08-21 23:14:35 What if he does and it's crypto-sadism...
322 2018-08-21 23:14:30 You guys are forced to buy crypto to preserve value.This will be great two fold, when crypto gets adopted.
1) Venezuela will have crypto,and will know it well.
2) The people will own the wealth of the country,not the retarded government.
This isn't a bad lookout really long-term.

326 2018-08-21 23:14:04 Thanks bro!
327 2018-08-21 23:13:59 When's @UglyGod getting a crypto currency??
328 2018-08-21 23:13:48 I wonder what a real (read non-Ponzi) crypto bank would look like. Could it make loans like any other bank requiring payment in crypto? Could it self-finance insurance to safeguard against a bank run with a smart contract? #cryptocurrencies #bitcoin
329 2018-08-21 23:13:32 Never had an issue with Stratton. But heard a lot from people, weather it’s true I can’t say.
330 2018-08-21 23:13:22 I liked the expression crypto-apostates!
Both words with a Greek origin/root
Crypto = κρυπτόν = hidden 
apostates = αποστάτες = defectors
331 2018-08-21 23:13:15 We are proud to be the first crypto project to implement hydro raindrop, pushing one step further the security in our products. This will be a fruitful partnership. Thank you @HydrogenAPI

333 2018-08-21 23:13:10 I have a 12 year old daughter and I hope one day she will fall in love with crypto like her daddy did. I am crypto for life.  I will continue to spend all my available resources to help promote the women of crypto and show the appreciation you deserve for your dedication.

337 2018-08-21 23:12:48 Dave old mate where can I apply? I make real good coffee and can turn a computer on. And I'll take a paycheck in XRP. Cheers 
338 2018-08-21 23:12:40 New baselines and standards have been set by block chain and crypto. Now waiting 2-3 days for a transaction to clear via a major bank seems like 1980s technology. Not a good look.
339 2018-08-21 23:12:37 まだ上がりそうな気もするけど？？
どうなの？？
340 2018-08-21 23:12:35 He must’ve blocked me too. My work is done here
341 2018-08-21 23:12:25 At this rate the entire ETHOS airdrop program will be less than a dollar! DISAPPOINTING!!
342 2018-08-21 23:12:23 I farm crypto and just had shower
343 2018-08-21 23:12:17 Maybe you about crypto-currancy sounds like
344 2018-08-21 23:12:16 Vino @tel coin is a good coin that is trying to resolve this issue, very intersting product, getting all their work done behind the scenes...
345 2018-08-21 23:12:13 Idk why youre arguing? It’s not traded! TA takes into account historical pricing to determine human psychology of future price movement. You skip that section in the CFA study material?
346 2018-08-21 23:12:08 Yeah these crypto billionaires all wanted to split the bill precisely down to the last $0.0361.
347 2018-08-21 23:11:57 that means that this s*** post cost you nearly $300 in the time you could have been profitting, and every time you sleep it costs you $85,000 , what a rip-off!

350 2018-08-21 23:11:20 You have a got long trek.  Wow.  But I would find ways to save here and there.  

At the end of the day.  It is your decision.  The extras you can invest in crypto.
351 2018-08-21 23:11:19 Do you have the cliff notes? Asking for a friend. 
352 2018-08-21 23:11:11 I think wormhole was another contender?

354 2018-08-21 23:10:56 I don’t disagree. Made a quick in and out on both though.
355 2018-08-21 23:10:55 No problem. All those people bring something different to the table and you can learn a lot from all of them. Of course the ladies are all beautiful, caring, and a breath for fresh air.

358 2018-08-21 23:10:40 What are you so excited for?  Bitcoin will eventually go under 1k and crypto will be dead
359 2018-08-21 23:10:25 Yeah something pre-runup. Maybe details pertaining to the crypto company they 'acquired'

370 2018-08-21 23:09:06 honestly, after reviewing his TL, crypto is giving him too much credit
371 2018-08-21 23:09:05 Thanks - totally enjoying it for now 
372 2018-08-21 23:09:01 Maybe you aren't, Mr. Smart Money... but I now have at least two followers with crypto sounding twitter handles... so maybe there's hope!
373 2018-08-21 23:08:58 I'd say 55% less than right now.

382 2018-08-21 23:07:38 I believe its because he was reporting/blocking anyone who had a differing opinion. Got a few accts restricted/banned/etc. That was the word going around anyway.
383 2018-08-21 23:07:36 Fascinated by the crypto-apostates: those who have once fully drunk the koolaid but then find themselves doing cartwheels trying to reconcile a whole bunch of facts...
384 2018-08-21 23:07:20 Thanks Elixium Crypto  for the follow!
385 2018-08-21 23:07:11 Curious to use the term crypto in cryptocurrency - it means concealed or secret.
Actually what's being hidden in all this gambling nonsense of #bitcoin? ....Quite a lot I think

389 2018-08-21 23:06:47 2 litre orange  juice in Australia is now $10. 3 yrs ago we paid $6. Oil fell from $100 a barrel to $45 but at the pump we still pay $1.48 instead of $0.85. This is hidden inflation. Soon Cryptos will jump to align with hidden inflation & ur crypto balance with explode higer

397 2018-08-21 23:05:35 It is cool to see you go to the crypto conferences Goddess.  We need way more women to show up and represent the woman of crypto.
398 2018-08-21 23:05:17 Those destruction parks where you can smash cars and things,... they really didn`t recognise that huge gains waiting in crypto. tzzzzz
399 2018-08-21 23:05:12 INTP is a very rare personality type, but it is pretty fitting for crypto twitter...I have only met 1 other INTP aside from CT

401 2018-08-21 23:05:11 I feel ya man... Regardless if crypto goes to the moon our work ethic will! 
402 2018-08-21 23:05:02 I find the idea that crypto needs new money to become profitable once more a little disconcerting but sadly, that's the way the cookie crumbles around here: we need fresh money in the space.
403 2018-08-21 23:04:59 So buy once the price moons?

Once it starts getting used and reports fly out, you’ll be too late. 

Risk Reward. You’re basically saying you are not willing to risk anything.

Crypto is deffo not for you.
I suggest checking out pension products.
404 2018-08-21 23:04:57 
405 2018-08-21 23:04:55 Yep sounds legit. Hey. Have you been watching the stock market and currency market? Mortgage rates, and employment rates? Because the USA economy is literally about to hit the shitter and you’re sitting her licking this guys asshole. How stupid are you actually??

408 2018-08-21 23:04:47 They will be using VisaNet: not crypto, not blockchain, not RippleNet, it does transactions in 30 minutes or less and it's more expensive.  Buuuut, VISA already has the established, globally trusted network.

437 2018-08-21 23:01:17 Hell no.
438 2018-08-21 23:01:11 Many buyers got in, got burned and got out...likely to never touch crypto again, including #XRP. Many of those were in the top market, Korea. So it’s going to take a whole new set of recruits to start investing at this point.

450 2018-08-21 23:00:09 It is telling that while #BTCUSD has held its June lows while nearly every other #Crypto has made new lows. With around 50% of the entire crypto market cap, the BTC divergence is indicating that major lows for #cryptocurrencies maybe in.

501 2018-08-21 22:51:43 I dropped out from offlane work for only one single reason - to be an expert in crypto.

502 2018-08-21 22:51:33 Perhaps you should look into #telcoin if you haven't already. It has the exact use case that you've described and beautiful vision. 

I will always $TEL the world #telfam, hope you do too.
503 2018-08-21 22:51:14 You totally missed the crime.  Understandable for someone so mentally challenged.  BTW, anyone with the word Crypto in their handle is suspicious to start with.  Alas, I need to move on to better things and smarter people! #Blocked

I hate "crypto" because it is (now) an abbreviation for "crypto-currency" and only one legitimate crypto-currency exists so I want to just say "bitcoin" but to much of the population they don't know this so I'm stuck. :P
511 2018-08-21 22:48:37 Its looking like the Proshare ETF wont be passed. Apparently its still too much of a risk in terms of stability and regulation.

537 2018-08-21 22:44:55 I'm also deeply unclear how my analysis supports the original poster's argument that Pol Pot was some sort of crypto-capitalist, when I directly state that he could still be an ML-based Commie and get US backing in the sociopolitical climate of the Vietnam War.

550 2018-08-21 22:43:31 The devil advocate,

1- there are many examples in the stock and Crypto market where investors were taken by the hype during bull runs, but then when the storm clams the realised the value of assets should be actually be less then a $1. 

2- cheap doesn’t mean can’t get cheaper
551 2018-08-21 22:43:03 
552 2018-08-21 22:42:59 Wow nice one
553 2018-08-21 22:42:49 How would "they" take Bitcoin?
Deep State "one world currency" is failing. Yuen is settling oil. $USD has a bond market bubble. Central Banks can't manipulate 100 + crypto exchanges around the world. What am I missing? (serious question).
554 2018-08-21 22:42:45 Think for a moment, what if the ETF is already approved and the Wall Street Bankers are playing their typical manipulation? Is this possible? Isn’t this how the “super rich” get richer? If ETF gets delayed again, guess what the Wall Street Big Money is doing? Buying your $BTC!

558 2018-08-21 22:42:19 A) it’s overrated cuz shorts can reach price discovery 
B) trend lines, Elliot waves (lol) and fibs on a non tradeable unit is false as there is no price history for a non tradeable asset. It’s like charting fuel consumption on your car saying it will go up/down in future
559 2018-08-21 22:42:18 Crypto at the moment is nothing more than a digital Ponzi scheme. Yes the early investors made a ton of money, but that’s the mechanics of a ponzi.

566 2018-08-21 22:40:56 But we could just end the war on drugs and thus again, eliminate the need for crypto? Again, there doesn't appear to be a single use case for crypto that doesn't have a simpler solution in principle. (Putting aside that yes as mentioned some people need a stopgap in the immeiate)
567 2018-08-21 22:40:51 This is bullshit.

609 2018-08-21 22:33:25 The real question is where did the #TRX go to that was in your wallet when your Bandwith went to zero, did it just Disappear into thin air, did it go back into circulation or was it Burned, if Burned then why no change in the number of coins in circulation,

888 2018-08-21 21:46:47 I feel like I'd just rebrand as What Crypto Did for all of it. Just my $0.02.
889 2018-08-21 21:46:44 Oh God yeah. These are the weakest people in crypto. If you don't believe that, ask them to come on my show and watch how fast they run. It's very disappointing

893 2018-08-21 21:46:10 そっちはオーガーだな。賭け事と保険を綯い交ぜにした実験トークンだ。来年の作物は今年より豊作かどうかなど、投票して賭けていく。農家は凶作に賭け続けるだけで、勝っても負けても美味しいとこ取りになる。リスクを分散できる優れものだ。予測市場なので凶作予想なら素直に畑を休ませるのも良いぞ。
894 2018-08-21 21:45:58 There are some Crypto Youtubers that do just that. lol Except they are hopeful that they are talking to someone out there.

896 2018-08-21 21:45:50 I was making assumptions.  Without researching I assumed @geekgirlreviews was in the game and knew her way around the playground.    

Assumed “Reviews” meant crypto reviews.

902 2018-08-21 21:43:50 If you have faith in Tether nothing else matters. Why do we need bitcoin or other crypto when Tether does the whole job?! Tether is the King of crypto!
903 2018-08-21 21:43:46 So true man! 80/20 ratio applies. But in crypto, it's probably 95/5 if that.
904 2018-08-21 21:43:30 Lets say 99 percent of coins dissapear over the next 5 years and there only a few projects left standing, these projects will recieve multiple times the funds other shitty projects are getting now, theres no reason tron can not reach 100, if adaption takes place

919 2018-08-21 21:40:12 I’m liking where the future is headed, especially where crypto is involved. Tokenising asset classes in this way makes perfect sense and is “honestly” an improvement on the model we have today. Reducing barriers of entry is a winning formula in realestate! 
920 2018-08-21 21:40:07 @sahelirc Hi Saheli - I'd love to pitch you on the WeChat blocking crypto media update. Might you be willing/able to share your email via dm?

Congrats brother! Very well deserved!
928 2018-08-21 21:38:44 One thing I've learned after 15 months in crypto is that no one knows what investors are doing with their own retirement funds and they do not care at all. You almost cannot have a market conversation with anyone. And that was me, before this.

936 2018-08-21 21:37:49 Its unnecessary to come to this when  normal conversation can take place without attacking each other. In the end we all in the same boat. 

It’s my opinion to both.  Have a discussion and don’t attack each other

Let’s enjoy the ride and respect anybody’s ideas. 

My 2 cents 
937 2018-08-21 21:37:47 Gained one. Hit that 300 mark. Wasn’t even paying attention. You guys just keep pumping my #’s. Can’t have enough degens
938 2018-08-21 21:37:31 Well i disagree. They say to do your due diligence in Crypto right? Well DD has brought many to $DIG. And @CryptoDadi explains things in a well thought out manner which benefits many. Why sizzle on that bro? For me its a winner with some of the best ppl including benefits to DIG

940 2018-08-21 21:36:48 Bitcoin could be the "Commodore 64" of crypto one day, but there will be new crypto (comparatively) "supercomputers" to replace it. Will it function? Perhaps on some level. Will there be better (scalable, decentralized) versions to replace it? Yes.

946 2018-08-21 21:35:23 And in 2013 (in a document marked confidential internal only) the RBA Reserve Bank of Australia (our central bank) was doing a fact finding/ analysis on Crypto/ bitcoin in particular and sighted some fallacies, but in closing saw benefit/ interest / utility in Ripple project.

967 2018-08-21 21:31:50 I agree with that. Many are salivating over the next crisis, expecting a lot of money to run to Bitcoin. That may be true but not before a massive crash that will convince many that crypto is done.

971 2018-08-21 21:31:39 I believe he said "*Dozens* of banks" by EOY 2019 , which would make sense because of the consortium of banks in Japan alone.

1020 2018-08-21 21:23:18 The Spanish anarchists had an interesting currency policy, which eliminated the overproduction paradox by placing value on industries instead of goods. I think crypto might go that way. It definitely could.

1046 2018-08-21 21:17:51 I will officially return to crypto twitter from tomorrow on

expect some mediocre memes and bad charts
1047 2018-08-21 21:17:48 I actually like #digibyte over other coins for this very reason. EVERY crypto is so focused on being currency that once they realize #BlockChain is much more it will be to late because $DGB will already be there! Ya being a currency is great but its not the best use case overall
1048 2018-08-21 21:17:48 Tether is a corner stone of crypto economy that we still can not trust. Probably exchanges already know what is going on and trying to cover it because if it will bust, every one will lose. It can go further, but what if somebody will speak up?

1104 2018-08-21 21:07:43 If you're looking for another reason that we will see a dump this week, it won't be the ETF rejection. Political instability in the U. S. Is more than enough reason for Crypto to react dramatically.

Hang on my fellow Americans, we could be waking up to a brand new world.
1105 2018-08-21 21:07:41 These are the days I wish I could cryo sleep til the bull run begins
1106 2018-08-21 21:07:34 And it seems like to me that the problem that *does* require crypto brings us back full circle to the "solution in need of a problem" and that problems seems to be "the modern monetary and financial world order" and subverting it and that's crazy town that doesn't even have Noam
1107 2018-08-21 21:07:08 Klopt. Alleen jammer dat een leek op het gebied van crypto / bitcoin vaak dit als tegen argument gebruikt.... “bitcoin is slecht voor het milieu”.
1108 2018-08-21 21:07:06 Exactly. More tether needed because people buying tether with their crypto ?

1124 2018-08-21 21:04:02 i have a question. why do you hold? in general, why does one hold crypto and not trade it? there are no dividends to be paid, the price fluctuates tremendously and pumps do not result in a stabilized higher price. what do i not know about holding?

1170 2018-08-21 20:58:02 NetCents, you guys have done such an amazing job throughout the halt, busy solidifying deals, working on the trust etc. Awesome job, and bring on the unhalt!! NetCents is going to take the crypto world to a whole new level
1171 2018-08-21 20:58:00 When Don Jr goes to jail it's going to be for the funniest shit ever it'll probably turn out he tried to sell an F-35 to Iran in exchange for crypto and leftover Jucero cartridges or something

1177 2018-08-21 20:56:33 They could open more shorts because they have Inside info on the Bitcoin ETF Decision on Thursday. Or place bids at $ 4000, or add margin to existing shorts. More unknowns than knowns, just saying
1178 2018-08-21 20:56:29 dude i care nothing about followers I am here to try and convince people not to fall into the crypto trap and to help them know the Lord Jesus Christ...that is why i comment, sorry if I came across rude I just think your picture is obscene and ridiculous
1179 2018-08-21 20:56:26 *Damn 
1180 2018-08-21 20:56:26 Exactly, we should be able develop and focus on the technology behind crypto more than the concern on bullrun,

1186 2018-08-21 20:55:15 I agree..it seems to look that way. However, snapping up funds of honest investors in such a despicable manner is not what the crypto communities needs.
It’ll just bring in regulations a lot fast I suppose.
1187 2018-08-21 20:55:08 Can you present a case (or link to one) that speaks to how to arrive at a fundamental value of various crypto tokens? You speak to the lack of sophistication in the markets yet this market benefited in tremendous funding from these unsophisticated investors. don't bite the hand..
1188 2018-08-21 20:55:04 Good judgement comes from hard won experience, which comes from bad judgement. 

A lot of crypto trader/investors are going to earn some valuable experience about their (lack of) predictive ability.

1214 2018-08-21 20:50:38 LINK I think is the next big thing. HOLO I also see the next big thing or worst case it will pump being so low in sats. It holds btc value well in a bear market. QASH I think is the next big exchange token and UUU has a ton of upside with limited downside due to price and mcap
1215 2018-08-21 20:50:35 One of the Haitian people told me that i don’t know how valid that is but the country doesn’t make money trading
1216 2018-08-21 20:50:30 The art scene is very much like the crypto scene: 90% scams but also 10% visionary. No point in comparing the ancients with the moderns. Different worlds, different tools. If da Vinci was alive today maybe he would be a great movie director, not a painter.

1240 2018-08-21 20:46:16 Excellent piece man. My opinion about this bull run and the crypto space is, we need to do more massive advocacies. Get everyone to have the tiniest opinion about what crypto actually and see it adopted. If this is done and we can buy roasted corn with #crypro d bull will run

1385 2018-08-21 20:26:07 Not necessarily.
Tethers may simply be one stop in a money laundering sequence.

DirtyUS$ -> $USDT - > $BTC -> $USD

The story of the laundered money in the Polish bank last fall is evidence of this scheme.
1386 2018-08-21 20:25:55 I just gotta ask, has any traditional market ever had predictions like BTC? Like "Experts" calling for $1 million per apple or amazon or even gold? Just curious now reading these comments, if that has ever happened or if BTC amd crypto is a totally new hype level.

1408 2018-08-21 20:20:32 I will add to crypto that there are different ways of viewing the strata. One is uniformitarian and they presuppose that it's a time capsule and thus organisms they would deem older are found in rocks they deem older. (no where is the actual geological column in order).

1409 2018-08-21 20:20:06 Crypto is  a strange world.

1416 2018-08-21 20:19:05 Talking about "tech" as an industry is becoming increasingly untenable given the lack of overlap in the varying stacks and business models in crypto, DNVBs, B2B SaaS, IoT, video games, media streaming, health tech, AdTech, etc.
1417 2018-08-21 20:18:52 They understand it,  they just decide to ignore it.  In hopes of history repeating itself.  Hoping for a repeat is hoping for crypto to move backwards, not forward.  Just for some short term bullshit moon gains.

1451 2018-08-21 20:14:39 This shows importance of underpinning digital assets with legal contracts. You can have assets in dematerialised form with blockchain as the register or ownership denoting legal title to such asset. Harder with native crypto currency but not impossible.
1452 2018-08-21 20:14:29 High schoolers have made better content. I know you’re eager and rushing and the current bear market isn’t doing you any favors. But a company trying to exponentially increase the size of the overall crypto market cap as you are can simply do better.

1588 2018-08-21 19:56:41 Tone is good choice. do ask vinny which bcash gang he blongs now. Ideal will be vinny predicting long bear market, he always predict almost exact opposite of what is going to happen.
1589 2018-08-21 19:56:31 I meant like taking over for something like bitcoin by ending the crypto currency Wild West. I don’t like the idea of not paying taxes and having my money be worth nothing or $10 million every ten seconds.

1594 2018-08-21 19:56:06 But Sir, @ToneVays is not convinced exchanges put hidden walls to keep BTC price at high levels and pumping liquidations.

1640 2018-08-21 19:48:20 I think there's a bit of a difference of opinion as to where we'd draw the line as to which side the greater evil is, but I think we covered this that I wouldn't *ban* crypto, I'd do what I could to dissuade people from it and rejigger it to tilt the equation so more good exists.

1657 2018-08-21 19:46:49 Crypto is the kind of market where one side of the trade is using oscillators on short/long ratio chart to justify pump while the other one is betting on an ETF denial even tho 99% of them do not even understand what it is.

It is not possible.

the best traders know this and calculate losses into their strategies.

1739 2018-08-21 19:34:41 But I think a certain blurriness has crept in between possibly different concepts: Crypto True Believers, Criminals, people who just wanna use the new thing kids are talking about(tm), Legitimate Users in Basketcase Weirdo Countries/Regions, Miners, etc. Miners are my main beef.
1740 2018-08-21 19:34:35 How many businesses accept gold, Peter? If i went to Wendy’s and tried to pay for a hamburger using gold, how many hamburgers could I buy? The point of how useful a currency is depends upon how many people accept it? Crypto currency is no better, unless you have the right one.

1744 2018-08-21 19:33:54 If you don't believe that scenario is likely to happen than you should cash out now. 

If it never happens than crypto is nothing more then a ponzi.

1748 2018-08-21 19:33:23 I get high off the food that I eat.

Why did I ever do drugs???

WHY ISNT ANYBODY TALKING ABOUT THIS???

1756 2018-08-21 19:32:31 What’s the difference? If they are in tether hot wallet they are not in circulation. If they are on finex they should be in circulation as they are not allowed to buy btc with uncovered usdt? Seems to me they are going in circulation now?
1757 2018-08-21 19:32:27 If you tweet from pc, you should be able to tag crypto teams by setting "you are with...", so I guess you should be able to save more chars!
1758 2018-08-21 19:32:18 I may not always agree with everything @WLFOFMYST says but that's how it should be. However, he's genuinely honest with gis tweets and always always gives credits to whomever deserve it. Honestly when shit hits the fan he's still here, not hiding.
1759 2018-08-21 19:32:08 Investec and Allan grey is more like shares so growth is unpredictable and fees are payable going through Capitec I am in charge like crypto. I want to know what I am investing in for me that is important and in crypto I will earn higher % than traditional stock.
1760 2018-08-21 19:32:01 Do you accept crypto? If not, let me know and I'll help you to provide that option for next auctions! Also, congrats for being that awesome role model for our community!
1761 2018-08-21 19:31:50 Crypto twitter is not the herd. Yes, being contrarían against the herd at extremes is profitable (Ie Dec 17).

Crypto twitter is mostly degenerates w a few successful early adopters.

Just cuz u bet against CT doesn’t mean u are betting against the herd.

1786 2018-08-21 19:28:32 Nobody said crypto is dead,  1.0, PoW, and the manipulated hobby market is dying.  XRP will lead 2.0.  Blockchain has never been more alive.
1787 2018-08-21 19:28:30 while being able to then revoke it. E.g. I upload my passport, you verify it, and then 2 months later I revoke your access to it.

A lot of this has gathered a lot of attention from teams, it was out of necessity for network security to preserve irreversible assets (crypto).

1791 2018-08-21 19:28:15 My best tweets, or at least what I think are my best, come to me when I have a beer in my hand.  This in turn means I end up not tweeting.  I want to apologize Tweeter.  
-If you want financial advice buy #assets not #liabilities  
There's my best for today, back to this beer.
1792 2018-08-21 19:27:57 The future is near. @Bytecoin_BCN will be the first crypto currency with a physical coin out there. Don’t miss this opportunity to get aboard! You have only one life, so treat it good and make it something worth while.

1796 2018-08-21 19:27:14 but it doesn't really change that for most people into crypto it's just one gold rush gamble after another for virtual pogs that people hope *this time* it's not them holding the bag at the end of the day when they decide to sell. Untraceable unaccountable xfers? Just a bonus?
1797 2018-08-21 19:27:07 Binance, the biggest crypto exchange, might be insolvent.

1807 2018-08-21 19:25:34 Still, could have the same effect, if someone has a plan to squeeze it up it will be like a walk in the park
1808 2018-08-21 19:25:34 Well, won't agree with that, first pudix using POS which is not cheap and not every small biz will spend 300$ to let their customers pay with $crypto, #MFChain offering a free app. What they simple can just delete, if customers will not pay with crypto and they will lose nothing.
1809 2018-08-21 19:25:19 Except we're not talking entirely about "worse-yet-extant" solutions; if that was the case the whole 50 tweet derail with Videah would never have happened; but no, some people do think crypto is superior to fiat currency and bizarrely "central banking". You can have your stopgaps

1813 2018-08-21 19:25:00 Hopefully you are correct.  I don't see it and been doing this for a bit now.  2.0 is on the horizon.  What happened in the crypto 1.0 test run has no bearing in the future.  I enjoy the gains I've seen but have let go.  I guess who really knows though?  Nobody.

1826 2018-08-21 19:23:41 I think a crypto company going public is selling out.
1827 2018-08-21 19:23:25 Lots of crypto investor likely had higher tax to pay in 2017 given crypto to crypto trades were taxable events (think every ICO). Any capital losses claimed in 2018 won’t be refunded until Q2 2019 at which point they might be reinvested back into the market + the cycle continues
1828 2018-08-21 19:23:05 Maybe rep is one of the strongest motivational forces out there.

No one wants to be a scammer - I don’t.

I don’t have a strong twitter following, but every follow by those I respect in crypto gives me a little extra push to work harder.

So if you’re reading this - thank you.
1829 2018-08-21 19:23:03 If patterns like this initial tweet become consistently easier to recognize then I'd bet it's going to start backfiring sooner rather than later.

1845 2018-08-21 19:20:50 I think we have too many mad predictions - 589 EOY, 58.9 EOY, etc.

In any case I wouldn't predict prices by a fix date in crypto. Your prediction looks modest. A stable growth, which I hope to see. But I think we'll see in between bull runs, which we've seen in previous years.

1854 2018-08-21 19:20:05 Lets suppose for a second that's true, that crypto some allows for people without millions to to do so and does not by definition make it *even easier* for those with resources to bypass: How is that at best, a pleasant convergence of circumstances and how does it justify

I’m over here trying to figure out how to run a crypto data & transparency business without spending $1mm in legal fees and drowning in red tape.

This is why crypto exists.

1878 2018-08-21 19:17:28 It is extremely likely that M3 is worse, may be much worse, than Yugo.
The reasons is simple: Musk wants to shove crap out regardless of the cost in the name of meeting meaningless milestones. There were probably people at Yugo who did not want low quality cars to go to customers

1897 2018-08-21 19:13:54 Someone text me today and said, "I think it's time to invest in Crypto. I was thinking of investing in Ripple and Tron, what do you think?" What would you answer?

1908 2018-08-21 19:12:20 Its like when Videah suggested Crypto is the solution for homeless people not being able to access the economy; why not just make them not homeless and give them bank accounts? Completely pulls the rug out from under crypto and I suspect this is possible for every legitimate one.

1933 2018-08-21 19:10:00 That's because you're a crypto-interventionist.
1934 2018-08-21 19:09:54 What I realized recently is that the #1 way for a crypto derivatives exchange to bootstrap volume is to:

1) make a product like the most popular product
2) make the payment formula more attractive to savers
3) make the mechanics and cost a net plus for arbitrageurs

just makes ico's seem even more scammy.
1943 2018-08-21 19:08:05 Totally agreed with that.  I mean being able to buy anything with any $crypto or being able to accept crypto for services with the subsequent wd into the bank account, without losing on fees, I can be wrong, but something like that doing #MFChain and their platform.
1944 2018-08-21 19:07:56 Obi was right.  That is a wild bunch.
1945 2018-08-21 19:07:42 Crypto donations!?
1946 2018-08-21 19:07:35 No need to wonder, crypto immediately boomed and busted when the media caught on. The coins that weren't outright scams are at least where they were before the hype.
1947 2018-08-21 19:07:23 I think @fitbit should be in on #blockchain that's an awesome concept footsteps verified on the Block chain! #crypto

1953 2018-08-21 19:06:31 It’s crazy thinking about 0.02 BTC being $177!! I still feel like 0.02 BTC is worth pennies. 

Back in my day $177 would get you at least a whole Bitcoin.

1957 2018-08-21 19:05:48 4 weeks and nothing. This isn't acceptable. Luckily I didn't pay with crypto or I'd probably be screwed. Because I paid with a credit card, I just need to log on to the credit card's website and dispute the charge, which I'm going to do if I don't hear anything in a day or two.
1958 2018-08-21 19:05:38 Yes it is very difficult.
I think even Quarkchain or Pchain won’t make it if Ethereum add something like sharding.

My pick for 2018 are Hashgraph, Radix and Rootstock

1984 2018-08-21 19:02:19 After experiencing the 2017 bull market and experiencing this 2018 bear market, you end up learning a lot about trading. But when you understand the crypto you’re investing in will be here for the future then hodling down 90% doesn’t seem so bad.

1991 2018-08-21 19:01:43 Speculation is about the only thing going for #BTC right now. 

As you pointed out, it’s too slow/expensive to use as it was intended, a currency. 

Speculative assets do not typically do good as a SOV. Granted, crypto is new tech but without utility use, I think BTC will fail.

1996 2018-08-21 19:01:15 Hypothetical: If you were granted the ability to look 3 years into the future of #crypto, but would be rendered unable to buy/sell/speculate or even talk about it for that same period of time. $BTC $ETH $ICX 
Would you:
1997 2018-08-21 19:00:50 Looking good 
1998 2018-08-21 19:00:45 Well, the real professionals in crypto-currencies, blockchain technologies and ICO cooperate with the Neironix. This is very good news for us

2008 2018-08-21 19:00:01 We don't need pumps and dumps ! We need more legit projects that can grow and give stability in the crypto world. Beside all ... projects, there are still some pearls between them. Crypto is the future.
2009 2018-08-21 18:59:59 Didn't hooters recently create a token?  I call that progress.
2010 2018-08-21 18:59:55 i WISH fox news would have you on....

that would be some fire shit right there!
2011 2018-08-21 18:59:45 Despite the crash this year, #cryptos are still beating the pitiful rate of return of savings accounts, if they bought 12 months ago. If tax rules were not hindering #crypto use, I think most people will choose moving more of their cash from their bank account to crypto.
2012 2018-08-21 18:59:36 King of altcoins - really depends on bitcoin.. ETH chart doesn't look very good though.  Crypto needs ETH to perform better - a lot of ICO's depend on ETH.
2013 2018-08-21 18:59:29 Hilarious that click bait desperate "media" try FUDDING anything they can. It's work shy "employees" jumping before they get fired for inherently poor work ethics, and nothing negative about the new owners.
2014 2018-08-21 18:59:25 @hoshogroup just checked in on one of the best teams in crypto. @thehartej was still at home playing with Shanti and slacking though while Andrew was working hard at the booth. 
2015 2018-08-21 18:59:21 Not sure, but they don't seem to like crypto much. I tried to use Twitter Ads once to promote a meme. After that, blocked forever. Their support says they can't comment on why and just point me to their general terms. Gotta hate centralization.
2016 2018-08-21 18:59:18 Sick pic man 
2017 2018-08-21 18:59:17 Anyone else find it odd that only #BTC hasn’t dropped in value over the last several mass crypto drops? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2018 2018-08-21 18:58:44 never bet more than you can afford to lose...if you’re in a casino that is...but if it’s crypto, by all means, take out personal loans and mortgage the family farm to buy exotic assets w names like bitcoin, ethereum, ripple, neo, qtum, etc.
2019 2018-08-21 18:58:22 Time to go long....what are the Futures figures?
2020 2018-08-21 18:58:09 I'd definitely be more interested in hearing from some of the OG "degens"

2023 2018-08-21 18:57:30 Very important to be able to spend your crypto.. completely agree with you.
2024 2018-08-21 18:57:20 Both are a mental illness
2025 2018-08-21 18:57:15 Always feel like I’m 1-2 industries behind in my 9-5 commitments, while my future vision seems relatively accurate, that said every industry is continually adapting, evolving, and changing....

Crypto is the obvious industry for future vision but my focus is not on crypto ....
2026 2018-08-21 18:57:01 Goals!
2027 2018-08-21 18:56:57 Dude, I know etoro has many flaws which I hate as well, but here they're not asking for some fees to remove SL. I don't exactly know why you still have SL on crypto at all as they have removed it some time ago. Maybe you have leveraged position?

2033 2018-08-21 18:55:42 Yound ppl wont accept the old, slow and expensive way to exchange money anymore. It needs to be instant and cheap. Its also much more fun. Every country or even socialgroups will have diff coins they use but it will be interoperable.

Why would you think I would be blinded by the 5th moon run??
2079 2018-08-21 18:47:24 But like I said I still bet on both, being prepared for if it goes up too, skin in the game

2084 2018-08-21 18:46:42 Oh, okay, but Rainbows End is kind of confusing/boring/difficult for most readers, unlike the adventure stories like A Fire Upon the Deep. But Rainbows End is a must-read for crypto folks. 
2085 2018-08-21 18:46:37 Derien 
2086 2018-08-21 18:46:37 A bit of TA but mostly a feeling. Just doesn't feel like enough bleeding, we're still 600%+ up from Jan 2017
2087 2018-08-21 18:46:30 Despite that it seems unrealistic, you still believe all things people tell you. 

There is no easy money in crypto.
Trust your own instincts, if if’s too good to be true, it often is.

2088 2018-08-21 18:46:10 驚いたな。それはZcashだ。そいつの上にビットコインを載せて、鋳造という工程を踏むと匿名通貨に変換できるぞ。取り出したい時は注ぎ込みという工程を踏んでビットコインに戻すんだ。俺の友達が一度実践してみたんだが、見事にビットコインが飲み込まれたまま取り出せなくなったらしくてな…

2093 2018-08-21 18:45:21 Without spendability, it's just a distributed ledger with the number on it. Crypto gains value when it's spendable and secured. You should see how bitcoin cash thrives in asia and the 3rd worlds to be a global payment system. Time will tell anyway
2094 2018-08-21 18:45:17 i 100% agree....i gained weight when i joined crypto... and sometimes life happens.. stress piles up... amongst other things... i always say... if you dont love me at my worst.. you dont deserve me at my best... your other half should to be your biggest support system & fan

2105 2018-08-21 18:44:08 This is precisely why there is such pushback toward blockchain from the current establishment: they do not want *power & authority* to be decentralized.
They literally *need* to be the nexus of trust in order to maintain much of their authority & relevance.

2107 2018-08-21 18:43:52 I find it curious how little #TRUMP devotees are willing to accept dissension. Even solid #Conservatives have their creds questioned because they don't march lockstep with Trump's (IMO #nationalist crypto-socialist) policies. Trumpies should just accept they aren't "conservative"

2122 2018-08-21 18:42:11 why should someone lie about owning crypto? if someone does not care about crypto he has no interest in lying. and if he likes crypto and doesn't own any, still no reason to lie in a fkin anonymous survey.
2123 2018-08-21 18:41:57 *exactly this*
We do not need to "blockchainify" all the things.

Hopefully that's not the case.
2126 2018-08-21 18:41:46 You need to do some research before regurgitating typical fud. There’s much more going on in the crypto market than the price.

2137 2018-08-21 18:40:37 I'm saying people who didn't know shit about crypto thought xrp could hit those prices. That's why it climbed so hard so quickly
2138 2018-08-21 18:40:13 Glad to hear that :)
2139 2018-08-21 18:40:02 Does anyone see crypto as a way of saving in addition to investing?

2143 2018-08-21 18:39:14 Grow up? Sorry but I have been in this market for quite some time now and we have gone through this BS every time..

We go up to ATH, we crash down..  people crying..  crypto dead..  we go horizontal, and he SURPRISE!! We go up to new ATH and all over again..

No need for that..
2144 2018-08-21 18:39:11 On bitmex (shortterm): Buywalls pop up when price on other exchanges goes down, whale can fill up shorts, buywall disappears, price rallies down to price on other exchanges, profit on shorts. Same with longs. Just need 2 accounts & enough xbt to setup walls. Probably bots.
2145 2018-08-21 18:39:00 "The mischiefs of a central bank spring from the power which the moneyed interests derives from a paper currency which they are able to control & manipulate."- Andrew Jackson... He's talking about our fiat dollar which politicians foist on us & which Crypto currencies may solve?
2146 2018-08-21 18:38:58 Let me teach you more pal... Those who founded turkish republic were crypto jews..That repuclic was run by cryprı jews until the sultan came to power..All critical posts of the turkish state has been occupied by crypto jews since 1923 including those in the army..

2148 2018-08-21 18:38:41 Oh, but I have. I simply reject the frame crypto-fans use of "how can I use blockchain to do X" rather than "how to best do X"?

Because the answer is never, ever blockchain. Trustless systems suck balls.

2161 2018-08-21 18:36:46 これを知らずに割安だと思って買ってしまった人、結構いそうだヌゥw
2162 2018-08-21 18:36:38 Regardless, what’s good in the crypto community? I haven’t checked my portfolio in months. What are you liking right now?

2164 2018-08-21 18:36:23 今後リップル社が保有しているxrpが市場に流通せざるを得ないほど市場が拡大することを期待していますし、リップル社もそこまで予測して1000億という発行数にしているのだと思います。

2167 2018-08-21 18:36:20 Hahaha :D thank you very much ! :D
2168 2018-08-21 18:36:18 I bet it will still be cryptocurrencies by then because cryptocurrencies is a word that appears a lot in this thread.  Also, blockchain.  Spelled different ways, like crypto-currencies.  Crypto currency. Block Chain.  Block-chain.  But we'll see what happens!
2169 2018-08-21 18:36:16 Ha!  And everyone invested in crypto will be a millionaire.  Grow up.
2170 2018-08-21 18:36:09 Indeed. More work means less trading which means less losses.... I traded my trading for my trade, went to work and got paid. Meanwhile others traded getting laid in hopes of basking in the shade. ETF got delayed, bills never got paid. ...lol I could go on forever

Why have a bunch of stuff laying around without being used when you can put its value to work.

2177 2018-08-21 18:34:59 Given "creating speculative asset bubbles" is literally the only use-case of crypto, it has everything to do with crypto currency and its boosters.
2178 2018-08-21 18:34:57 So are you suggesting that if xrapid goes live it’s impossible to reach $5 eoy??? I think you have all forgotten this is crypto and it dosnt work the way any other investment class does.
2179 2018-08-21 18:34:53 I'm seeing 2x-3x more overload responses since mid-July through early-August, but still 90% fewer from March-June.  Another frustration is the clustering of above-average response times during price movements, even if overload is not triggered.

2185 2018-08-21 18:33:05 If you can't withdraw your crypto to a private wallet, you don't own it; you are just funding some trader's bets.  If the trader ever makes too many bad bets, your "portfolio" will disappear.

2200 2018-08-21 18:31:20 たしかに、リップル社の保有率が高いことに関しての議論が起こるのは理解できます。
しかし、お言葉通り全く新しいデジタルアセットという分野において、保有率に関して持ち過ぎかそうでないかを決めるのは、私たち個人投資家ではなく今後の実需やそれに伴って拡大するであろう市場だと考えています。

2226 2018-08-21 18:28:05 i think finding an undervalued coin in this market is a challenge, considering there are so many shitcoins out there and prices are bottoming with respect to market support
2227 2018-08-21 18:27:58 Being salty towards everyone just cause you had losses won't improve your situation, on the contrary, it closes doors. Make friends during the market depression, it's a time ppl might be more open to it. No one likes gold diggers. Friends are with u when you're down.
2228 2018-08-21 18:27:52 Not sure which country you are, where i live when holding a crypto longer than 12 months all realised profits are free of taxes which can save u up to 55% depending on combined profits
2229 2018-08-21 18:27:52 Nah next bullrun will get us way past old ATH, it's how the market had been working for years now..  it's waves, happens  every time and will happen now. Also we then will see another retrace again and all people crying "crypto is dead" for the millionth time..
2230 2018-08-21 18:27:37 Ah oui, c'est carrément de l'investissement en mode kamikaze. On n'est pas plus serein que les mecs qui allaient chercher de l'or en Californie en 1850.

2246 2018-08-21 18:25:51 Of course there have been worse things in Crypto. But I'm not sure if it's not also fraud if Investors are lured into giving (more) money with using false promises. Also the pr-stunt: It wasn't fraud but it was done on the back of their Investors.

2285 2018-08-21 18:18:41 Why do crypto traders feel the need to invent new terms for trading? Haha. TF is a “buy wall”? That’s just a level, son. It may be real, it may be fake. But it ain’t no wall.
2286 2018-08-21 18:18:36 I had a long series of attempted “funny” tweets mocking ICOs 6 months ago.

2294 2018-08-21 18:17:16 @Bakkt Will BAAKT expose crypto trading to retail brokerages like @TDAmeritrade? Will this allow trading through 401K / IRA accounts?
2295 2018-08-21 18:17:16 それなんだよねえ
2296 2018-08-21 18:16:58 Yes indeed. If there where just more exchanges to partner up wit IOC - this would be a top 20 coin at least. It’s a small team of dedicated devs and it‘s pretty tough to deal with these ridiculously overpriced listing fees. Give $IOC a second chance @Poloniex. Thx guys
2297 2018-08-21 18:16:49 Not true for gold, there is a set amount and a limited resource, the demand keeps its value. Crypto is different in the sense that people can make as many coins as they want
2298 2018-08-21 18:16:38 It’s fractional reserve biz mode holding it back lol.
2299 2018-08-21 18:16:35 the world crypto is very defrence from stock market
2300 2018-08-21 18:16:31 Agreed. Ride the bull.

2303 2018-08-21 18:16:09 これはETCか。イーサリアムがハードフォークした結果生まれた通貨だ。theDAOの事件があった後、イーサリアムが「事件が起きなかった時のチェーンまで巻き戻します」と実質的なロールバックを行って、それに怒った採掘者たちが反発して今日まで動いている。まぁ思想の違うイーサリアムだな。

2305 2018-08-21 18:15:17 Thanks I’ve seen a lot of people raving about the ledger. As a intermediate hot wallet some people have suggested exodus or Jaxx. ? 

My understanding is if you buy from somewhere like coinbase you send crypto to a unique address on exodus / jaxx and then move it across to ledger
2306 2018-08-21 18:15:11 Guys its TMZ.  If you are here, manage your expectations
2307 2018-08-21 18:14:32 every market that has had futures introduced has become controlled and manipulated and totally detached from real world demand and/or cost of production etc

2310 2018-08-21 18:13:34 Las crypto también responden a novedades y demás si las sigues, el problema es que el mercado es muy pequeño y la manipulación de los whales es más grande que el efecto de lo primero.

2317 2018-08-21 18:12:11 I don’t really agree with “control markets”. It provides a more accessible way to short, so it can reduce volatility and can help hedge positions. That might be a good thing long term. It might lead to more realistic price discovery and less insane bubbles.

2321 2018-08-21 18:11:21 CNBC's problem is that they think crypto is a real, regulated market which it ain't as we all know.

2328 2018-08-21 18:10:13 Although probably true most of the time I entered last year but just created my account today. Despite the price action I see the developments being made in the space and wanted to dedicate an account to the crypto ecosystem. Crypto is here to stay

2331 2018-08-21 18:10:01 Yea long term is definitely better, but increasing liquidity when the underlying asset is held is still a great thing even if the trades are short term.
2332 2018-08-21 18:09:54 no futures are designed as speculative tools to control markets. just look at how it is used for precious metals price suppression

2348 2018-08-21 18:08:25 Who knows, maybe CME feels pressured or feels safe with the regulators to start holding actual bitcoin once Bakkt starts doing it on a big scale. That’s a possibility as well.

2350 2018-08-21 18:08:23 I don’t see nearly enough foundation respect in crypto
2351 2018-08-21 18:08:01 With the main net will come the exchange so it's more than possible. But in the hand some trader holding since december will probably sell, so we never know, it's crypto!  On my side, don't really care... I'm there for the passive income

When you do look at it, the quantum superposition will collapse into one of the definite states.. #crypto
2354 2018-08-21 18:07:45 yes that I agree with
2355 2018-08-21 18:07:36 Nice man. Just got off active duty last year to trade crypto full time.
2356 2018-08-21 18:07:34 I think that’s the disk crypto. My chief complaint is it deciding to get stuck after that step because there’s a USB C device within 100m.
2357 2018-08-21 18:07:32 Agree 100%! Form is Key.
2358 2018-08-21 18:07:22 that's the point lol
2359 2018-08-21 18:07:20 People don’t realize that lifting smaller weight to build up strength is the better route

That’s how injuries happen
2360 2018-08-21 18:07:11 I agree with this while playing poker or blackjack, but in trading, learning to employ patterns is a deft skill, not as robust as we may like, but still an important element to it.

2367 2018-08-21 18:05:59 Yes of course, but some futures volume on CME might move to Bakkt and/or Bakkt may grow itself to eventually have impressive volume like CME.

2420 2018-08-21 18:00:25 They've pretty much written off New York & Cali. Don't worry, I'll be rich off crypto in 5 years, then the next 5 I'm gonna make myself the right wing Soros.

2452 2018-08-21 17:57:25 @nolimits It's a brave decision to accept 15000 companies - would surely be beneficial to include a company building a new kind of crypto exchange (quanto derivatives - may surpass Binance volume due to leverage).

2453 2018-08-21 17:57:01 Welcome man! Looks like the Indiegogo already closed out? Should launch another one and make it wider spread! Let's promote the sh*t out if it. Maybe we can convince indie to take payment in crypto? OCN? Maybe even make it to CNBC with it to make it take off!

2505 2018-08-21 17:50:27 This is an evolving financial space, they need to make moves they believe are best for LT, even if it doesn't match the plan.   I've been in crypto in a while, seen a lot of BS.  I'm critical if I need to be, but these guys are killing it.

2563 2018-08-21 17:41:57 My crypto timeline so far:

*Learned the market late 2017, luckily in time to sell at peak ($17.5k avg btc, alts around similar time)

*Learned I sucked at day trading in early 18, lost ~10% of trade stack.

*Learned to sit and do nothing in mid 18 to protect stack.

2568 2018-08-21 17:41:11 @alegw maybe you can give us some insight in how crypto is actually being used in Venezuela. Do you know if it's used as store of value (savings) to combat the inflation of the bolivar or is it more used for smaller transactions?
2569 2018-08-21 17:40:58 That’s a hilarious mind set. Like the hipsters of crypto

2577 2018-08-21 17:40:30 I sort of figured out how the $btc #crypto market runs. So I was hired by a manufacturing company to run some saving projects, I asked what was the goal, the goal is to go from big red numbers to less big red numbers, the company has never been in profits (funded 10 years ago)...
2578 2018-08-21 17:40:26 Oh yes the church lady!  Imagine if snl did a #crypto special?
2579 2018-08-21 17:40:15 Yes. And I fucking loved it.
2580 2018-08-21 17:40:08 A lot of people hear ETF and assume it’ll be good for the current crypto market. The ProShares ETF, up for denial/approval this week, would likely NOT have a net positive effect on the current price of $BTC. Its value is determined by futures contracts, not backed by actual $BTC.

2671 2018-08-21 17:27:38 I got crypto trading opened today. Buying rate is ~100usd above average rates, which translates to about 1.5% fee I guess. Biggest issue is that I didn't find any way to withdraw bitcoins, so I guess they are not my bitcoins then?

2722 2018-08-21 17:21:08 Maybe I'm old school but I've always viewed crypto currency as a gimmick. At least gold and silver have intrinsic value. I fear people are panicking and turning to gimmicks.
2723 2018-08-21 17:21:04 I see your point in terms of the potential gains, but getting into crypto is about more than just making bank. It is about taking control over your value and escaping the fiat inflationary nightmare. I would be curious what the real inflation rate was over those 4 years..?..

2740 2018-08-21 17:18:23 It would push it past $1 IMO.  Utility will drive volume and in order to have increased liquidity the price of XRP would have to increase.  With the usage of XRP this will also drive demand. The speculative all time high of $3.80 will be a thing of the past. #xrp

2837 2018-08-21 17:07:36 Give it a look. They are spending a lot more money on content they commission these days. But as someone who covers crypto, you are probably up to your eyeballs in marketing schlock published on Medium
2838 2018-08-21 17:07:34 Agreed.  BTC is rising and shorts rising to ATH...  Talk about indecision right now...  #crazy
2839 2018-08-21 17:07:34 Seems legit . Anyways do we need ETFs? The only reason to have them is to feed the speculators. First there were scammy ICOs now we have ETFs - both are poison for the space. Just my 0.2 cents of course

2872 2018-08-21 17:03:26 It's important to note that this only covers data from one exchange, Bitfinex!  The crypto market is very fragmented with dozens of exchanges and several OTC liquidity providers, and as such it is really difficult to get an overall picture of positioning that is accurate.

3067 2018-08-21 16:44:57 Crypto Fund managers deploying most of their capital now will likely be significantly more successful for the next few years than ones that have been deploying capital over the last 9 months and it will basically be because of luck.
3068 2018-08-21 16:44:56 I think it's still wrong in BitMEX context. If I want to get instantly liquidated on a short position of $3200 with 30x leverage I should get to do that if I want, but with ~$100 in margin. When liquidation breach is involved, the calculator forgets that I want to use leverage.

3120 2018-08-21 16:38:58 The point is compounding your gains tho,170$ x30 days a month,you do the math on the extra income...
3121 2018-08-21 16:38:55 BTCウォレットを見ていていつも困ることは，
どこから送金されてきたものなのかよく分からないこと。
普通は額面と送金日で大体判断。
今回，2つの送金が纏められ，同時期に別の入金があり混乱。そのため未着金があると思ってしまった。
送金元にトランザクション情報があり助かった。
3122 2018-08-21 16:38:51 I do the same for “discounted”
3123 2018-08-21 16:38:46 Eid Mubarak b
3124 2018-08-21 16:38:43 lol - did they actually try promoting this to crypto people, and not to the number crunching crowd?
3125 2018-08-21 16:38:43 Still no Exchanges? Only idex. Thats not good, or am i wrong?

3134 2018-08-21 16:37:33 バーンは初期に見積もっていた程は普及しなかったという計画の甘さや見通しの悪さを露呈を意味している。

株式併合も発行した枚数に対して株価の単価が安すぎるという状態の解消だと思うので、似ている気がしますね。

3136 2018-08-21 16:37:10 that said, most crypto enthusiasts are actually fine and reasonable people, and I do try not to judge them by their worst and most obnoxious nutters, e.g. the flood of such I dealt with yesterday, oh boy

3140 2018-08-21 16:36:55 Basically, banks want as little capital as possible locked up in the settlement process, and that is achieved through delayed settlement and netting. To do instant settlements on a blockchain with actual cash (vs. later netted & settled credits), they'd need more money on hand.
3141 2018-08-21 16:36:54 @TalibKweli thanks for the retweet, can I get a follow back please?
3142 2018-08-21 16:36:41 If everyone in $BTC trading says shorts will get rekt and there's a pending short squeeze, then why are longs and price not going up due to everyone wanting a piece of the #crypto pie ?
3143 2018-08-21 16:36:35 So are you implying that most of GenX and baby boomers are $TSLA shorts and will suffer the consequences? 

We agree on the consequences part.
3144 2018-08-21 16:36:25 @paulvigna any interest in coming on @thebtcpodcast to talk about the growth of the crypto industry since you started writing about it?
3145 2018-08-21 16:36:23 Who made you a judge of anything?  You just got on here. 25 followers.....you are in the category (for me) “when I want your opinion, I’ll give it to you” - Al Capone.  Troll be gone!
3146 2018-08-21 16:36:06 
3147 2018-08-21 16:35:50 the ideological basis is more normal and socially acceptable - BTC is "CRYPTO ANARCHOCAPITALISM NOW" and ETH is "make a technology and get rich from it (and a soupcon of crypto ancap)" - and quite a few non-crypto ppl have told me they much prefer ETH people to BTC people
3148 2018-08-21 16:35:41 He said that some companies we’re integrating onto the Blockchain and that was the cause for some of the transactions? (I couldn’t really tell I was at work when the video streamed) Either that or more testing I would assume.
3149 2018-08-21 16:35:35 Well some are just born naturals and others need to learn it. If you put the time in you can master the art

Buy walls: whale wants to push the price up so inexperienced traders buy into his sell walls.
Sell walls: whale wants to surpress price so you panic sell into his buy walls = buy signal.

3170 2018-08-21 16:33:30 Geloof ik graag. Enige remedie is politieke omverwerping van vele westerse landen. Verzet tegen globalisatie en financiële macht. Daarom geloof ik in crypto’s. Daar hebben politiek en die machtscentra geen vat op.

3173 2018-08-21 16:33:20 Spot on! A system that wants to change the World needs to be corruption-proof.
What excites me is that crypto will allow us to organize within previously unfathomable parameters. People will subscribe to whichever economic system they believe in. Not just capitalism or socialism.

3183 2018-08-21 16:32:33 Me being someone who uses a graphics card more for productivity than gaming, these prices will kill that industry. With 4k footage, you NEED a good graphics card to even view it in Premiere. Fuck bitcoin and crypto currency for fucking up the GPU market

Im not sure the continued beratement is speeding up the process.
3185 2018-08-21 16:32:27 Yep. That’s my main focus. Getting title work down to just a few days. And getting funding time reduced significantly. Would like to see 5 day turn around times on closings.
3186 2018-08-21 16:31:57 If you hit 80% you'd be retired and not running it on Twitter lol.  People keep saying other options are better all of a sudden but can't name anything.  You say Vet is too spread out among industries but then what is eth?  It went from no use case to too many use case in a month

3192 2018-08-21 16:31:40 I think your hunch is right as the buyers last night were real and large.  But to assume those 2 bids are from the same buyer, is stretch!  This sell off is about crypto wealth conservation.  If u own an ico, u likely owned/still own BTC. It does feel like it’s basing tho.
3193 2018-08-21 16:31:30 Hahahaha, show me the proof of that, lmao. stats provided by your church?? hahaha, people who don't masturbate are more prone to rape my delusional friend.,lmao!

3197 2018-08-21 16:31:10 $CY straight up 6.5% since Fri's open when the semis were just getting puked because, you know, $NVDA was down on crypto; on another note, saw that equity hedge funds on avg down 1% for the year- wonder if any relation:)??
3198 2018-08-21 16:30:46 I think the reason why cross-bank money transfers take several days is because banks want to net settlements against each other so only deltas needs to be transferred. They're basically extending credit to each other (or through a clearing system) so they need less money in cash.

3234 2018-08-21 16:26:50 He didn't try to devalue it into crypto. He attempted to launch a secondary crypto currency in the country, which was an absolutely nonsensical decision. A decision unrelated to socialism in any sense.

Make sure you are doing your research to see who is buying viewers, subscribers, likes, comments, etc.

3252 2018-08-21 16:25:00 After the plastic straw epidemic & the private prison crisis, the crypto energy panic has to be one of the frauds going on right now.

3255 2018-08-21 16:24:52 What is the "most important" unaddressed aspect about crypto? I found the Times article bizarre. The promise of crypto to create better/more fair financial systems etc has ZERO to do with FOMO'ing into a speculative instrument.
3256 2018-08-21 16:24:35 Btg even in the difficulty that crosses the Crypto Coins can do much better!
3257 2018-08-21 16:24:33 You tell your personal things to a guy who could be gay? lmao... I just go to pornhub or xvideos to relief myself, it works!

3259 2018-08-21 16:24:25 Haha! 

No worries, thank you very much, i appreciate it!
3260 2018-08-21 16:24:25 I don’t think anyone is inherently against layer 2 solutions. I think big blockers are against using a production quota on tx throughput because it creates high fees and unreliable confirmation times. Better approach is to let layer 2 freely compete with on-chain.

3290 2018-08-21 16:21:50 Spending it would still be a problem. There are a lot of way governments could cripple a crypto, stifling speculative investments and basically destroying its price. 

So yes, it’s true bitcoin can’t be stopped but it’s price would collapse if it was pushed back to the dark web.

3292 2018-08-21 16:21:37 At this point in the bear market, you should be praying for crypto blood. "Getting rich quick" is out the window, so you might as well buy the coins you like for as cheap as humanly possible
3293 2018-08-21 16:21:10 For one to see the value proposition in $VET they must understand how the token economics work. There is going to be a learning curve, hence why there are skeptics. Better to leave it be and see where the year takes us.

3300 2018-08-21 16:20:09 Different from what you're looking for here, but still interesting to me:

NVIDIA built a big company solving a specific need (gaming) insanely well. So, when new industries (AVs, crypto, VR) needed high end GPU, they had the best technology way ahead of the problem.
3301 2018-08-21 16:20:07 porque?
3302 2018-08-21 16:20:05 I agree with you. In general, as you said, only time will tell. I hope positively for crypto-coins otherwise I'm half-screwed k :v

3306 2018-08-21 16:19:24 A recent study found 81% of #ICOs were scams with only 8% reaching #exchange. Amazingly, only 15% of the genuine projects treat online reputation management, or #ORM as a priority. FUD is on the up & trust is at a low. Be proactive with your rep, not mistaken for a scam. #Crypto

3381 2018-08-21 16:12:53 I definitely understand the ways crypto could be used as a tool of control and enslavement.

But I also believe that the people who see it like that don't see the world the way I do.

They overlook the potential it has to expose truth & unite the masses by aligning interests.
3382 2018-08-21 16:12:45 Futures volumes are meaningless though as doesn't create any underlying demand for #BTC

3386 2018-08-21 16:12:25 It's like my bank in the UK that sometimes blocks me from buying cryptocurrency...I go in and the little boy behind the counter tells me it's for my own good. Then I try again a few weeks later and I can indeed buy crypto. Kind of like 'blocked but not blocked'.

Suppose you will learn thru experience.   $VET is NOT #1 vs all the other choices in crypto or supply chain interoperability.   Most of their relationships are “talks” and not bonafide business

3444 2018-08-21 16:08:32 I was talking crypto with someone today and they just found out that it went up 20k last week. As consumed as we are we forget that it’s still a niche thing. What happens when more than 1% of the world is hip to crypto. It boomed off of word of mouth last year.

3521 2018-08-21 16:01:22 @Tronfoundation @justinsuntron  We need some big cooperation with companies from gaming entertainment sector. Sony Playstation, Microsoft Xbox, Steam etc. Users from these sector is much more educated for fintech and this is one of the basic way to get crypto in mainstream.
3522 2018-08-21 16:01:12 Because I dont trade in BTC in a market like this. Watch closely when BTC moves and look at how the BTC/pair bleeds and then switch to the USDT/pair and see for yourself the results. It will be an eye opener.

3553 2018-08-21 15:58:10 Yeah, I am thinking about an asset backed crypto too. Real estate projects would be a perfect start. May be need a CTO to join in at this moment
3554 2018-08-21 15:58:07 It doesn’t make sense to pay a 5% real interest rate on a mortgage. So there would be no market for mortgages.
With crypto, real estate prices would plunge. If you didn’t have a home, you still couldn’t buy one. But if you did, its price would be cut in half. How nice is that?

3563 2018-08-21 15:57:12 Porte legal de armas ya! y así estos hampones lo dudaran para actuar! en este país corrupto sólo tienen armas los policias y los delincuentes.

3566 2018-08-21 15:56:58 ほんとにだいぶすごい。六本木のバーでもし話しかけても、なんだこのクソガキ‥でスルーされますもん。良く考えたら。
これ以上言ったら僕の天性の煽り屋が発動して逆に怪しまれてしまうので控えますがw
3567 2018-08-21 15:56:54 While the distributed "cloud" which has no single authority by definition does not and cannot. The day it could is the day the governments decided to become said central authority for said crypto currency.
3568 2018-08-21 15:56:52 The way I am looking at that Looks like either way. Do you see it leaning one way more than another?

3575 2018-08-21 15:56:21 Definitely possible.
3576 2018-08-21 15:56:21 I don't have a prediction, I mean, its sad but a lot of people invested in DAPS to get rich overnight. Its just not gonna happen, I can tell you.

I also invested in DAPS but I really don't have a prediction.
But ye, who knows? Anything can happen in crypto.

But $1, sorry but no
3577 2018-08-21 15:56:17 I didnt! double luvs then

3584 2018-08-21 15:55:37 Be careful man ppl out there gettin raped & killed on POF & Tinder.
3585 2018-08-21 15:55:24 Y pensar que són centavos comparado a lo que roban politicos. En una republiqueta camandulera con salarios miserables, sobrepoblación y falta de oportunidades esto núnca terminará!

3594 2018-08-21 15:54:26 I feel sorry for the people out there that put in loans and mortgages in January to buy bitcoin and other crypto currencies.... without understanding the market. But the first rule of trading is not to invest, that you can't afford to lose. 
3595 2018-08-21 15:54:16 Bakkt is the reason everyone should be bullish on bitcoin if your invested in cryptocurrency right now you are in a good place #bakkt #Bitcoin #Crypto

3603 2018-08-21 15:53:27 La agenda de su programa es promover el crimen con estos "reportajes" que sólo incitan a que más delincuentes sigan los mismos pasos. Al final los ratings de este programa depende de que haya crimen. Eso sí, núnca tocan el tema del verdadero problema. LA SOBREPOBLACION!
3604 2018-08-21 15:53:23 That guy has always been weird to me. And now he’s big into crypto, which is a red flag.
3605 2018-08-21 15:53:21 隠しオーダーですね
Kiwameさんのnoteで勉強しました。
FXアルトのはなしはぼくには難しかったです
全然関係ないですけどVETが強くてぶっ飛びそうです
3606 2018-08-21 15:52:43 Yes we are buddy. Make sure to sell now so you dont lose everything 
3607 2018-08-21 15:52:42 やはり銀行の腰は重たいのですね（いい意味で慎重ですね）。先ずは送金業者や取引所などがxRapidを使用して事実的な根拠が証明されれば採用これから楽しみです。

3610 2018-08-21 15:52:36 If you're talking about Briebart, then I agree.
3611 2018-08-21 15:52:36 Don’t waste your time. I was skeptical on $VET until they did the split. Now they’re probably the best investment in crypto. Let all the plebs watch and see. September is coming fast!
3612 2018-08-21 15:52:26 I remember listening to them on a podcast, RIP in peace
3613 2018-08-21 15:52:19 will?
3614 2018-08-21 15:52:16 Open one?
3615 2018-08-21 15:52:15 Depends on investment style and risk tolerance.Crypto needs btc and alts to become a mainstream investment vehicle not only for us but for all the funds ETFs ETNs being created worldwide.

3618 2018-08-21 15:51:57 Your beard is thicc
3619 2018-08-21 15:51:45 The problem is the legal status of crypto currency in the US there is a major divide between those that want to classify it as a security token and a financial asset, to lawyer one of these would certainly fit your definition of laundering.
3620 2018-08-21 15:51:38 まさかの謀反でゲロ吐きそうです
3621 2018-08-21 15:51:35 Sorry, $1m :)
3622 2018-08-21 15:51:28 So let's get this straight.
 
#Malta is holding itself out as the #BlockchainIsland and attracting, among other interesting characters, #Chinese #crypto exchanges escaping #Japanese regulation & AML. 1/
3623 2018-08-21 15:51:21 don t know and don t really care too, 1.5 years in crypto and still think i m a big noob so... no leverage for me... :) (poll show many or most think they are good lol = REKT)
3624 2018-08-21 15:51:05 not so sure I would lay the blame at Adobes feet there, DeepFake is opensource software built on general neural networks software. Technology can be misused, tools can be misused, look at all the advances nuclear weapons, crypto cracking machines, and ICBMs enabled after the 50s

3630 2018-08-21 15:50:37 person to hire? If both have equal talent...
A: Person wants $300k package. $300k salary, no equity.
B: Person wants $300k package. $100k salary, $200k equity.

Person A will just head off with the next best offer. More recent crypto example would be EOS warchest to buy ETH devs.
3631 2018-08-21 15:50:37 まさかの返信ありがとうございます。カピさんとやりとりできる器ではないのに恐縮です。またツイッターでのルールや常識も正直わかっておりません。リツイートからのやりとりも失礼をおかけしているのではと思っております。
3632 2018-08-21 15:50:22 As sketchy and manipulated as tether is, don't let it cloud your view on crypto as a whole. While it may prove very destructive when it implodes, the future of crypto is still bright.
3633 2018-08-21 15:50:16 Winklevoss brothers have created a new self-regulatory organization for the #cryptocurrency industry. It’s encouraging, but it shows that the US has a lot of catching up to do – Japan and Korea had this for a while now. #crypto #btc #xrp #bitcoin #altcoins
3634 2018-08-21 15:50:15 Help family
3635 2018-08-21 15:50:08 Yes and no. I've learned quite a bit from Crypto Twitter, but you have to dig through a lot of bullshit to get there.
3636 2018-08-21 15:50:06 Good old days
3637 2018-08-21 15:49:52 I agree with your RTX concerns Andrew - the #1 immediate issue, soon to be compounded by ‘peak crypto’ comps over next 2 Qs - but their datacentre business is growing at 80%+ yoy.

TPU is a small problem for small customer set rn. 

In time, sure, but not next 2-3 qtrs.

3638 2018-08-21 15:49:51 well the data clearly shows that they do lol, do you have your own survey that contradicts this? Your comment clearly shows you have no clue about surveys.. just because % of people that own crypto is higher, doesn't mean that more people own crypto lmao it's simple maths
3639 2018-08-21 15:49:48 idk but that new profile pic is fire flames

3672 2018-08-21 15:46:56 You too. Never meant any disrespect, I hope that was clear. Good luck.
3673 2018-08-21 15:46:30 Not NEARLY enough price manipulation for it to be crypto.
3674 2018-08-21 15:46:27 Big money won’t allow crypto to go up like jan again for awhile. They want a piece and can push the price down really easy so they can get in cheap. Expect $5,000 BTC prices before we see $10,000 again but we will get there

3683 2018-08-21 15:45:54 Of course not, but it's all part of the game mate. Trading is very hard for most people, and I bet around 99% of people in crypto are in loss right now!

3690 2018-08-21 15:44:24 Reading long books and following crypto most advice. One should start out doing a simple forex newb course for free. They should learn how and what each global data release means in depth. Learn what moves traditionally, that are causing their micro crypto market's little moves.

3701 2018-08-21 15:42:56 Good nice idea, I like the idea of the project, I think that the project will be implemented in the crypto world, but a lot depends on large investors, how much they like this project, or if it will find a response from millions of people.
3702 2018-08-21 15:42:47 every time I log in here, crypto twitter is fucking trying to predict the next move. "wuh wuh wherez bitcoin gonna go tooz" stfu already. Trade what you see happening and stop trying to predict whats going to happen. Fucking gamblers
3703 2018-08-21 15:42:29 Most wise
3704 2018-08-21 15:42:27 Malta is more cryptofriendly than Japan. GAFA are all using remoted offshore islands to optimize their financials and move to others if the setup optimization is better. To me lack of transparency in crypto space is a real issue, but moving to Malta is not.

3716 2018-08-21 15:40:41 YOu got valid arguments, regarding the scams and illegal activities, surrounding crypto & Bitcoin.
But you still have a lot to learn (like myself &everyone else).
Mortgages and banks will exist within Bitcoin. Bitcoin can be fully law-compliant. And will be in the future.

3719 2018-08-21 15:40:19 Me not wanting to indulge you in a bullish $ price prediction for a random crypto has nothing to do with my long term outlook for crypto.
90% of today’s crypto will be gone in 3 years. I could maybe perhaps risk a Bitcoin guess but the rest is just an uneducated guess

3736 2018-08-21 15:38:09 Haha yeah. I’ve been saying this for awhile now. Comments were only made at a congressional hearing and/or news interviews. Nothing official, or binding on the SEC... but, crypto twitter hears and tweets what it wants! 
3737 2018-08-21 15:37:58 What worries me most, is the frequency people vape which is increased compared to smoking and they dont realise the amount of condensation sitting in their lungs throughout the day.  For example, none of these heavy vapers would stay inside a sauna room for too long and be ok.

3743 2018-08-21 15:36:47 @ChuckModi1 Do you think the falsification of evidence is a systematic numbers game from the top down? Or are each of the so called "experts" acting independently in some kind of blind do-good justice "This is how I think it should be"?
3744 2018-08-21 15:36:39 Noticed the same correlation, but it seems that it's flipped (stockmarkets and crypto).

Assuming from there that we'll see a correction in the next months on stocks & upwards momentum on crypto, as there's not much upwards potential anymore in the stock markets and techstocks.
3745 2018-08-21 15:36:34 No gray area for $BTC! Do we dump or pump?
3746 2018-08-21 15:36:32 I am always looking for somebody with previous crypto bear market experience. The few I found remain peculiarly tight lipped. The same old story, I guess, they don't want to give anyone an edge. So we'll have to get smart ourselves.
3747 2018-08-21 15:36:13 The use of #blockchain technology on #Milc platform eliminates the need to have intermediaries, which reduces the price of media content.

3758 2018-08-21 15:34:27 People always point out the value that accrues in crypto exchanges and mining, but another moneymaker of the market is the ICO issuers (launchpad). when the book will be written we'll find the shitcoin shillers made the most money upfront.
3759 2018-08-21 15:34:12 So what I’m saying is if he said “digital assets are the world’s first” and “the only production ready digital asset” then what is the issue? It seems we’ve hit on the fact that you care more about whether you personally consider it a crypto or not, not whether it works or not.
3760 2018-08-21 15:34:12 I venture to guess that Crypto Twitter users have the largest block lists on the platform and Binance's referal system is responsible for the majority of them.
3761 2018-08-21 15:33:58 Investing Tip

If you are heavy in alts + btc and don't want to gamble on the upcoming ETF volatility (pos or neg), open a hedge short or long and avoid the action. 

If you can't handle stress, keep it to a minimum.

Hedging is one of the best tools you have.

3849 2018-08-21 15:26:08 How can EToro customers spend crypto when it’s locked away with zero wallet support and a new wallet which will also have zero support for old positions. Found this tweet a bit hypocritical to be honest. Not yours Muzza, the original.

3856 2018-08-21 15:25:10 Thank you Tim,

I attended the Blockchain panel you were on at Oppenheimer's Tech Conference and really enjoyed your way of clearly explaining how much of a sea change crypto/blockchain is in a way that was understandable for analysts and managers.

no idea why so many haters try to get fame
3864 2018-08-21 15:24:09 If we see a ProShares Short Bitcoin ETF approval, it will rock the #CT world and absolutely destroy so many shorts... In crypto UP usually means DOWN .. I'm not expecting it to pass, but imagine if it did!!!  The CBOE would be a shoo-in and we begin our $BTC moon!

3874 2018-08-21 15:23:23 what would worry me about trying to invest in cryptocurrencies as opposed to just trade, is that very few people are actually building anything crypto related. a lot of projects have only a handful of people working on them. that’s not a very bullish sign.
3875 2018-08-21 15:23:07 a lot of those discord groups are like that, the only one i'm in now is Bryptos, too many like CC are just filled with trolls and hate
3876 2018-08-21 15:23:00 I think it’s good. I’ve gotten a few already. Don’t really see a downside. Also a good way for coins to promote cheaply
3877 2018-08-21 15:22:46 Just my opinion, I feel the crypto space is about the innovation and the technology crypto has brought, we’ve had a tremendous and successful growth although even more ahead, bitcoin hit $20k without any ETF as the growth has been, we can achieve the desired growth without that
3878 2018-08-21 15:22:42 Imagine if something fell off of the flying car and hit people on the ground? Yes! Way ahead of their times! Google glasses the same - way to early! Crypto is not b/c solves the trust problem now AKA Inflation, fraud, data mining, reduces cost of going public by 10X or more.
3879 2018-08-21 15:22:35 Higher leverage, you ll get more profit along with price increase, but you'll get more loose along with price drop

3898 2018-08-21 15:20:17 Yes. My friend who loves soccer, is now more convinced on what this means for Bitcoin & crypto, even though he's very hesitant on it in general. He's beginning to see the "potential".

He considers this a HUGE DEAL for soccer in general.

3909 2018-08-21 15:18:55 my general rule for trading crypto is to cut losses. i don’t really get the investing aspect because everything is speculative. you’re not really investing in anything but the idea price will increase. not the same thing as investing in a business.

3937 2018-08-21 15:15:34 I think that shorts are going to drop based on the velocity of their rise, the divergence with RSI and their proximity to ATH. Whether that will be a squeeze, profit taking, or assuming small losses ... that I can't predict.

3944 2018-08-21 15:14:31 Imo the biggest problem facing crypto and stopping mass adoption is being your own actual bank. 

All these great people on crypto twitter and 95% of them staying anonymous to avoid ‘bank robberies’. 

Whoever solves this will make 
3945 2018-08-21 15:14:18 Everyone is expecting it not to get approved, so why would it matter when it doesn’t? Anyone who dumps on etf getting rejected has already dumped because everyone knows it isn’t getting approved.
