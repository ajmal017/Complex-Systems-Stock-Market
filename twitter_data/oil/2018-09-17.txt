0 2018-09-17 23:59:50 @CharlyABC13 @abc13houston ??? Extremely helpful report on black mold, but we couldn't discern which oil to use after soap. We replayed your segment 6X with captions turned on but captioning ended with "wash it off" so we still didn't get what kind oil.  Can you help? Thank you!
1 2018-09-17 23:59:41 I don't understand it either, mind you I've never had it. In fact the only place I've ever even seen it is in the shops. I think it is one of those things that people used to eat but since olive oil has become readily available everyone has just switched to proper dressings.
2 2018-09-17 23:59:40 my mom discovered cbd oil and she’s so happy about it :’)
3 2018-09-17 23:59:40 What’s at stake is that we as a society need to radically throttle back our use of fossil fuels & then eliminate the demand for refinery output. Improving the oil refining process is not part of that critical path though would be a good thing in the oil business’s last years.

12 2018-09-17 23:58:21 What has TAMU done in football consistently? They have plenty of 4, 5 and 6 win years and only one 10+ win season since 1999. Oil money doesn't make it a better program or job, just makes it a higher paying job.
13 2018-09-17 23:58:12 Tonight was my first time using an essential oil on Wes before bed. I picked it up at target. It’s a sleepy time combination, and I hope and pray it helps! He still has a slight cold and has been suuuuuuper clingy and whiny. I need him to be a bit more independent again!

16 2018-09-17 23:57:42 What does it has to do one thing with another? I want governments to help them in their countries, but they do not, keep selling weapons, doing dirty deals to get their oil, coltan, gold... this could be stopped by western countries but it won’t.

37 2018-09-17 23:57:07 @rockitmeister is Steel Meister the same product as Rockit Oil Lustre? I can't find the latter anywhere so I'm hoping you renamed it. Friend loaned me his can and it works great on my fridge but I need some more!
38 2018-09-17 23:56:19 Oil companies are so wealthy I don’t understand why they are not embracing this with everything they have instead of riding a sinking ship. Oil will not last forever
39 2018-09-17 23:56:01 The challenging thing with Molly now is that the sassafras oil to make pure MDMA is getting increasingly difficult to get which is causing molly to get cut with things such as Fentanyl and Meth. So if you’re gunna do drugs, test them first!
40 2018-09-17 23:55:58 HAVE you heard of neem oil as male birth control? It's safe and natural, you'd think pharmaceutical companies would jump on it, but of course not because we already have a solution of making women suffer, why bother sparing us when there is something safe and easy for men to do?!
41 2018-09-17 23:55:44 I can feel my flatmates judging my toast with oil every morning but then again Im the international student gremlin here so no one cares

50 2018-09-17 23:54:39 I shit on "economists" every day of the week. But really I am always talking about those who have power and are referred to as economists.

The real economists are just scientists. They aren't snake oil salesmen.
51 2018-09-17 23:54:36 100% agree. On the substance of the trip: NYC is the global leader of large municipalities for divestment of oil/gas by its pension funds and investment into clean energy. The former is path-breaking mega important. NYC and London are genuinely pushing other big funds. A BFD.
52 2018-09-17 23:54:34 All my beautiful U.K. friends are heading off to dreamland. Sad times. But you need your rest though! So I'm saying goodnight back and expect more and more tweets from me in the near future. Possibly tomorrow. Lol. Hugs and sleep very well "Oil Tot"!

‣Rice cooked in chicken stock with tarragon.
‣Butternut squash with sage, thyme, mustard, white pepper, fresh garlic, and maple syrup.
‣Flounder sauteed in olive oil with garlic, rosemary, and a very light amount of celery seed.

57 2018-09-17 23:53:36 Anyone else with a beard care routine have a bad experience with L'Oreal products? I tried the beard wash + conditioner, as well as the beard oil, and my skin went from clear to a flashback of puberty, just a fuck ton of acne everywhere.
58 2018-09-17 23:53:36 It wasn’t bad though but different as I usually broil it with olive oil. It’s something that I will make again though. Thank you again Willy.
59 2018-09-17 23:53:33 what's more most of that capex spending is oil related, a response to the oil price surge, not the tax bill

64 2018-09-17 23:52:32 It’s almost like the universe wants me to risk it all and just drive into the back on an oil tanker rn
65 2018-09-17 23:52:20 Considering Cola originally had cocaine as an ingredient. I’m hoping the CBD oil will be FDA cleared for cola soon :-)
66 2018-09-17 23:52:16 Tonights supper was homecured pastrami, cubed and sautéed with a little duck fact (to get the cured brisket fat to melt); finished by reducing some fresh lime juice, then tossed with cumin rice: Kale steamed with salt and olive oil.
67 2018-09-17 23:52:14 They’ve fudged the numbers from the past 100 years to make their models work.  They’ve admitted to it. Big globalist money makes oil money look like crumbs.  Have you researched the 10k year Greenland Ice Core survey?   How did big oil raise the climate in the Medieval Age?
68 2018-09-17 23:52:14 12時間は寝すぎだろ…
69 2018-09-17 23:52:13 It sounds small but multiply millions of litres per ship by the total number of ships,  and were talking about 70 million gallons of oil per year.  Add to that all the other waste water and its not a pretty picture.
70 2018-09-17 23:51:46 which city?
71 2018-09-17 23:51:23 Peppermint oil is a godsend for when I have a migraine.
72 2018-09-17 23:50:48 That's #ClimateChange caused by China burning a lot of coal and oil but it's not all that common to see China getting called out for that.
73 2018-09-17 23:50:22 Ashy?  now that’s a good one considering the fact I tried to get your dusty ass to use coconut oil
74 2018-09-17 23:50:17 My mom accidentally gave our cat 10x the amount of CBD oil she’s supposed to
75 2018-09-17 23:50:03 Oh myyy oil done  omg
76 2018-09-17 23:50:03 I sell cold pressed coconut oil.. very affordable
77 2018-09-17 23:49:56 I guess I'm gonna slather my hair in coco oil bc my hair is fried and platinum
78 2018-09-17 23:49:47 Pulled into work this morning and had a check engine light, dead battery, and needed an oil change.

80 2018-09-17 23:49:43 Who believes Bloomberg US news agency to tell the real story?  More BS.  India a China are buying more of their oil from Iran, but that's not in Bloomberg figures.  mmmm
81 2018-09-17 23:49:34 You should tell China to stop burning so much coal and oil.

85 2018-09-17 23:49:01 So much lying. U vote out the middle class at every opportunity. U LIE like trump lies. Does your wife lie like u? U have made $10,000,000 in congress working 4 the Koch’s, gas & oil. Your lying flows out of your mouth like a NC river in global warming flooding that u ignore.
86 2018-09-17 23:48:54 Probably has an odifferous bouquet of crap in a bucket, rained on for a month & tipped over in 100 degree heat & 90% humidity added to  the flowery essence of "Oil of Olay" & the fresh application of baby powder (for chaffing) on filthy, long sweaty skin (covered by fat rolls).
87 2018-09-17 23:48:48 I just need a lil oil, a blunt & a black 
88 2018-09-17 23:48:45 Oil of oregano!
89 2018-09-17 23:48:25 Huge... I mean gigantic shoutout to my mother. She is watching Naomi so I can take a 30 minute bath. I have a migraine and feel like death. This very hot oil and rosemary epsom bath is literally life right now. #beingamomishard #imback #ahhhh #relaxation
90 2018-09-17 23:48:20 This is about the oil industry and buffer zones for the fake nation.
Control of oil is control or subjugation of industry.

Wakey! Wakey!
91 2018-09-17 23:48:19 Who is questioning the oil companies interests?
92 2018-09-17 23:48:15 Don’t look because Big Oil money is suppressing the company with a boatload of negative, merit-lacking media and massive short position. Any share under $300 is a STEAL (I see price target above $1,250 in next 3-5 years). Take a free test drive and then make your own decision
93 2018-09-17 23:48:07 Mmmm been neglecting my face oil at night time and I've just put it on now and I really didn't realise how much I missed it 
94 2018-09-17 23:47:51 virgin olive oil 1 large spoon, P B fit 2 large spoons, use the back of the spoon to blend in to a thick past, remove stones by cutting down and fill with the P B fit past, put them in the fridge over night, any you do not use can be stored in a jar in the fridge,
95 2018-09-17 23:47:43 @ShaneOliverAMP @JustinWolfers re #trumpchinatradewar has anyone done analysis re China dumping billions in US Treasuries? Wouldn’t this be an unintended consequence of hot trade war (like when JP bombed Pearl Harbour in response to US oil embargo)? Thanks
96 2018-09-17 23:47:43 Although The Pakistan Citizenship ACT of 1951 is present, it wasn't implemented in regards to the refugees for decades. That is why it is such a big deal. This is also mentioned in the article referenced, Please read it before commenting.

106 2018-09-17 23:46:29 This 2:1 oil gives me energy, I wonder if that’s the increased CBD in it. But not exactly what I wanted lmao
107 2018-09-17 23:46:28 Everybody is NOT YOUR ASSIGNMENT .  ASK GOD  BEFORE YOU WASTE YOUR   OIL.
108 2018-09-17 23:46:26 No kidding. Half-measures that maintain the status quo and our dependence on oil/gas, while attacking those actually doing the fighting for our health and planet.
109 2018-09-17 23:45:54 I need some lavender essential oil
110 2018-09-17 23:45:40 Why do body builders rub oil on their bodies?
111 2018-09-17 23:45:35 If you are sick, take a bath with Epsom salts, baking soda, tea tree oil, peppermint oil and lemon grass oil. That’s some voodoo magic shit right there
112 2018-09-17 23:45:33 Not knowing when to get your oil changed is ignorant bottom culture 
113 2018-09-17 23:45:20 อีกบ้านละ

115 2018-09-17 23:44:43 You're gross, and I can't imagine why anyone would buy the snake oil religion you peddle.
116 2018-09-17 23:44:22 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
117 2018-09-17 23:44:02 DPR Watch: #EIA put shale play #natgas production growth at 961 MM/d for October. Last month's iteration of the DPR had September growth forecast at 1.0 Bcfgpd and at 1.07 Bcfgpd for August.  As with the oil model, EIA is sharply putting the brakes on their gas growth forecast.
118 2018-09-17 23:43:56 Maybe we shouldn't have cut out the shot of the super dirty stirplate with the dark brown oil bath...that would have done it.
119 2018-09-17 23:43:45 My face produces so much oil it’s ridiculous
120 2018-09-17 23:43:36 Spoonful of honey, coconut oil, half a lime juice, a pinch of garlic mix together really well and swallow ever 45 min it’s going to help soooo much 
121 2018-09-17 23:43:30 Looooove when my mom cooks rice with coconut oil
122 2018-09-17 23:43:29 Lol make the oil no too much Cox some people will just fry egg in ur head

125 2018-09-17 23:42:46 I tried to work on my doctoral thesis, but I couldn't find my bottle of oil.
126 2018-09-17 23:42:45 You know why they DO this? Especially the tiny countries, Japan builds their infrastructure or Community Centers to buy their UN votes. Perhaps oil trade is the reason Norway buys in. It's all about the money.
127 2018-09-17 23:42:30 Putin kept the charade going by selling off most of the country's assets, including oil based assets

He had a great plan by buying all those ice breakers to grab a stake in the north arctic, but it looks like time expired too quick to have it save him
128 2018-09-17 23:42:26 The official amount mentioned earlier that YouTube wouldn't have it. I think fb and the oil site. Blackout restrictions in effect so i how that doesn't screw you from watching it.
129 2018-09-17 23:42:19 Absolutely- its great for everything, and no oil so its better for you, if only a little lol.
130 2018-09-17 23:42:18 Teachers against oil and gas should start using candles and an abacus, as the saying goes “practice what you preach.”
131 2018-09-17 23:42:11 CBD very interesting and AFIAK no psychosis risk. But medical cannabis strains can be very high THC and cannabis oil and edibles very high as well
132 2018-09-17 23:42:10 Ok. So explain why they need to generate false “global warming” results in order to get grants. And explain why it’s not easier to understand why oil companies have a vested interest in questioning the science of climate change.
133 2018-09-17 23:41:55 Not lately. *I add some lavender oil to the bathwater, then hold out my hand to help you into the tub* Now that I have you home, I’ll be able to put more time into it.

I called him on it, said the man is conning you, just like you con everyone, how could you be so stupid to fall for the snake oil??? He just went silent. Nuts
137 2018-09-17 23:41:31 It's the truth dude. The Biden's deal with the Ukranian oil & gas cos & did they register as foreign agents They also spoon with China buying up US property. Biden looks out for foreign interests than ours

145 2018-09-17 23:40:02 Do any of you use CBD oil, and if so, what has your experience been using it?
146 2018-09-17 23:40:00 Coconut oil?
147 2018-09-17 23:39:59 Pull up to get my oil changed and the guy tells me it will be a 45 min wait cause the employees are chasing down a lady who just did a hit and run...

151 2018-09-17 23:38:57 It gets more and more like the Spice wars on Dune every day, only the spice is oil.

165 2018-09-17 23:36:53 No, the minister said such long term guarantees were a mistake. Nobody but oil lobbyists & their marks think developing green power is bad.

171 2018-09-17 23:35:39 We literally shared our entire Space Program with the Soviet Union, which is why they still Launch our Astronauts to the International Space Station, and our oil companies moved in after the Berlin Wall fell.

174 2018-09-17 23:35:19 @nhsuk there's other problems? look no further than paul. he's attacked patients to say words to each other in an enforced manner, with legal texts to allow for pauls oil to allow the patients to use that method. and conveyed the monarch"" text to them too.

176 2018-09-17 23:35:05 way to expensive.cheaper to go to jiffee lube ,even with the new "lower prices".the service manager was unprofessional and made me feel like he was glad I was leaving. I used to have my oil changed there regularly but I won't go back.
177 2018-09-17 23:35:03 David, cannot wait for you to try a quality CBD oil and see the results for yourself.
178 2018-09-17 23:34:52 I got it to drain.  Had to plunge the disposal side. I think its oil & build up & that there was something in the toilet drain cuz it was fine itll it got replaced.

182 2018-09-17 23:34:01 The land belongs to all Canadians; not certain special interest groups or corporations. You'd be surprised of the cooperation between some bands and some corporations in regards to oil and gas and logging. Sadly it's the all mighty dollar that drives many :/
183 2018-09-17 23:33:27 Got the WRX a fresh oil change, tire rotation and detailed inside and out today after all the damn miles put on her from working up in the Boondocks the past month or two. She cleans up good. 
184 2018-09-17 23:33:21 There’s a magnolia tissue oil from Pep that my friend used & worked within 3 months of consistency. Apply after bathing & every night, wear your tights. It’s only R20
185 2018-09-17 23:33:18 I'm just a dumb old oil and gas trader but I am going to start using the phrase "crude maximalism" at the next Railroad Commission cocktail party #OOTT
186 2018-09-17 23:33:14 This is honestly disgusting! Obviously because it's a Tesla... but you don't touch somebody's damn vehicle!!! I don't care if it runs on oil from my ancestors... you don't mess with people's possessions!

188 2018-09-17 23:32:59 The Iraq war was rationalized as war on terror, but I have no doubt that one motivation for it was oil.
189 2018-09-17 23:32:56 Turkey sees the YPG as a terror group, Iran has increased operations against YPG affiliates at home and in Iraq, Russia sees them as a US proxy and threat to the integrity of Syrian soil and Assad wants his oil back. The US is going to have a very tough time backing the YPG.
190 2018-09-17 23:32:53 Well i know u might not care but i do these ppl risk their lives to keep us safe .but keep drinking that snake oil its guaranteed
191 2018-09-17 23:32:53 Venezuela's economy did not tank in a vacuum. Global market fluctuations on the price of oil tanked Venezuela's economy. Market fluctuations are only a characteristic capitalist systems. Fluctuation on the price of oil are largely due to America's meddling.
192 2018-09-17 23:32:40 Roasting veges with olive oil, garlic and herb mix is the best new thing in my life
193 2018-09-17 23:32:24 She straight up just cooked chicken in coconut oil and served it. Nothing else on it. I bout choked to death 
194 2018-09-17 23:32:24 If I had a dollar for everytime someone not from southeastern New Mexico told me “Ya’ll got a lot of oil down there” I wouldn’t  have to work in these damn oilfields anymore.
195 2018-09-17 23:32:03 I tried to get the pearl handle brush plus the body oil that say $3.99 but it then goes to links where it’s not $3.99 Finally sent a help request. Probably will wait a week for an answer.
196 2018-09-17 23:31:56 Cetaphil + olive oil!!!
197 2018-09-17 23:31:41 I’m SO glad Morgan told me she was allergic to coconut oil bc it’s in so many products and I’d feel so awful if I gave her something that made her skin freak
198 2018-09-17 23:31:35 SA's practices are essentially the same as the red cross so I wouldn't trust them. Most vets would also swear that giving up their lives for oil companies in endless offensive wars was the same as protecting freedom those wars were already used as false justification to eliminate
199 2018-09-17 23:31:19 The sexiest soft skin alive! My hands ...hot oil ....and sweet slide!

Try massaging your scalp with coconut oil
201 2018-09-17 23:30:49 Tories asset stripping scotland. They did it with oil and will continue until there is nothing left - then Scotland will get independence
202 2018-09-17 23:30:46 No I saw the E45 eczema cream in superdrug today but it was like €18 :( I've been putting rosehip seed oil on it all day

204 2018-09-17 23:30:41 It depends on the type of migraine it is but I’ve found peppermint oil (rub it on your temples or where the majority of the pain is) and laying in an extremely quiet and dark room with a warm washcloth over my forehead

207 2018-09-17 23:30:17 Your best bet is probably to stay on the matte side and be sure to set your foundation well. For full coverage I like the “Too Faced Born this Way” foundation & for a BB cream, the “IT cosmetics your skin but better oil free CC+” also priming with a mattifying primer helps a lot

210 2018-09-17 23:29:44 Gas prices fluctuate and has zero to do with President. OPEC controls fuel and oil prices. You wanna bitch about the rich, maybe we need to call the towelheads and complain about their hammering us in the ass with ridiculous prices,instead of pinning everything on Trump.Jus sayin
211 2018-09-17 23:29:42 What they should have done is fix it, but that is not what cons do, unless it is the oil industry.
Doubtful it had anything to do with the mill being built in Dakota. It was built in dakota because that is where the money was.
Happens all the time in every industry.
212 2018-09-17 23:29:29 Not much affect on my business, all AWP machines I buy made in UK, Jukeboxes shipped from America, pool tables made in UK, maybe a very slight indirect affect of parts to those manufactuers but much more volatility from example oil price.

216 2018-09-17 23:29:15 oh hey, about we get a fair market value for our oil instead of giving it away.

219 2018-09-17 23:29:00 I just ate some leftovers tonight but I'm thinking that's what I'll do tomorrow. I forgot about the broiler. Maybe with some olive oil, rosemary and salt and pepper
220 2018-09-17 23:28:39 Hey y'all, I love my CBD oil! I feel so much better!!
221 2018-09-17 23:28:33 You have proved the original point. 

Iran was at peace if only because Britain and America demanded their Oil Companies come in.

He wanted to nationalise.

The Russians moved in to Afghan in '79. Americans armed opposition. Extremists took over. Oil and greed....
222 2018-09-17 23:28:17 More power to ya, friend.  I only do the simple stuff.  Oil changes and minor things like filters and wiper blades.  The rest I leave to the professionals.  That said, I wouldn't ask my mechanic about my plumbing, nor an electrician about pouring a concrete foundation.

235 2018-09-17 23:26:08 True. But would rather have the land go back to First Nations than big oil.

243 2018-09-17 23:24:30 Do the old silver foil over the top of the pipes trick. Much better than trying to get oil off hot pipes
244 2018-09-17 23:24:19 ...to increase production or change refining processes.

There's no such thing as "normal" oil, but it's the ones that make them most profit that produce the most straight fuel production, so those are probably the ones we (as a species) need least.
245 2018-09-17 23:24:13 saturday was my moms bday and yesterday i got a hair cut and changed my cars oil and cleaned a lot. im almost done with spivak critique of p.c.r. first sunday w/o microdosing which really only happened two sundays in a row. ready for to move out. i love my friends.

259 2018-09-17 23:22:21 I personally would be changing out to oil ASAP
260 2018-09-17 23:22:17 Hey! Thanks for reminding me my ride needs an oil change.
261 2018-09-17 23:22:14 Cafeteria's pancake is made out of 0.1% flour and 99.9% oil. Best breakfast I've ever had in my entire fucking life. How in the world of fuck could somebody not make a fucking pancake? It's just a fucking pancake. 
262 2018-09-17 23:22:11 I'd be tempted to try as a clueless amateur but messing around with essential oil of tobacco sounds like a great way to get nicotine poisoning.
263 2018-09-17 23:21:42 I do. I do a cuticle oil a few times throughout the day and then a more intense balm at night along with gloves. The packing and unpacking and cleaning and everything wrecked them.  and when I do a mani, I soak them in a cuticle remover, then push back and clip as needed.
264 2018-09-17 23:21:35 so i made avocado toast with olive oil, stone ground brown mustard, salt, and pepper on rosemary sourdough bread and i think i'm qualified to open a restaurant here in california now
265 2018-09-17 23:21:34 There are some important caveats on those simple numbers, as not all oil is created equal.  Crude comes in many different grades, and this means that many oil fields and/or refineries could be largely shut down  and it would only impact fuel.  

Others would need...
266 2018-09-17 23:21:34 I know someone who had a $250 oil change recently.  The "highly trained staff" at @jenkinsandwynne couldn't get the oil filter off the oil filter mounting bracket and said they needed to instead break it off and replace it.  @toyota is totally sticking people for service costs.
267 2018-09-17 23:21:30 Fearing for when my hair dries after conditioning like 100 times when i got out i put omega oil (Haha) in it usually it just gets frizzy anyway but [HRRG]
268 2018-09-17 23:21:25 So, is truffle oil - oil of truffle or truffle flavored oil? Hahaha!
269 2018-09-17 23:21:24 Oregano oil! Tastes horribles but its magic!
270 2018-09-17 23:21:22 I work 60 hours a week for a marketing agency making damn good money. I don't have a lazy bone in my body. However, I do have a brain, and as an upper middleclass American, I'd  rather see my tax dollars go to education and healthcare instead of wars and oil subsidies.
271 2018-09-17 23:21:22 Not with so many #FakeClaims.. I mean Currency, oil, no border were only the start of an endless cascade of problems...Scotland really dodged a bullet in 2014, everyone knows that... we'd be crazy to go back tie a blindfold on and ask the firing squad to have another  go...
272 2018-09-17 23:21:19 Using CBD Oil can’t hurt either.
273 2018-09-17 23:21:12 Frankincense is an essential oil. It’s one of those weird ones that works for like all sorts of weird things.
274 2018-09-17 23:21:05 The US really doesn't have much need to be in Syria. It doesn't care about the oil. Impeding Iran and improving relations with Turkey probably matter most to the US, but the impeding Iran part iscmore for KSA, Israel and an anti-Obama obsession among some in the White House.
275 2018-09-17 23:21:05 I've also heard that fish oil in the diet can help with dry skin too.
276 2018-09-17 23:20:56 When we went from unlimited rpm to 78-8000, I went from 900 to 1500 laps on freshening. No real need for titanium valves, and don’t really even need an oil cooler anymore. Biggest savings in the 25 years I’ve been racing. I don’t agree with not allowing the tires to be cut/worked
277 2018-09-17 23:20:30 Salah ayat tu. Baking soda is actually a harmful chemical. Because everything in this world is chemical including water, oil, sugar and salt.

282 2018-09-17 23:19:50 That’s really not saying much.  Venezuela’s oil is like tar, difficult to extract and all their top oil people left when the industry was socialized by the government.

285 2018-09-17 23:19:38 Respect that. Actually don’t even welcome one of them but also stop occupying other lands for #oil and #drug businesses.
@SecPompeo you don’t let Afghan or Syrian refugees in your country but what are you doing in #Afghanistan and #Syria ?
286 2018-09-17 23:19:35 NUTRIENTS! also our toenails are the same materials as our fingernails do if they don't grow..  idk, dip them in that nail oil!
287 2018-09-17 23:19:20 Use peppermint and lavender oil. Both have antimicrobial properties which should help. Diffuse them and add to tea with honey.  Hope you feel better soon!
288 2018-09-17 23:19:18 ああオイル、どうして君はオイルなんだ…
289 2018-09-17 23:19:05 @PepsiCo @Nestle @Pizza Hut & @TacoBell spend millions on their ‘ethical’ image & say they only use RSPO-certified #palmoil. But truth is @RSPOtweets gives the OK to destructive palm oil by brand @Indofood #savetheorangutans
290 2018-09-17 23:18:50 Soft warm titties wrapped around your hard shaft...? What’s not to like. Better if they’re silky slick with oil or line and big enough that she can lick your tip while she’s still wrapped around you. 

I’d rather finish between than than over her face.
291 2018-09-17 23:18:44 2 tbsp honey (local is best), 2 tbsp Apple cider vinegar, 2 tbsp lemon juice mixed in a cup of hot water with cinnamon sprinkled in is my family's life saver! Also a couple drops of oregano EO in a carrier oil when you start feeling bleh. AND On Guard cough drops! Feel better! 
292 2018-09-17 23:18:43 Put it where it hurts, Empower. Its ia great oil or lotion that will take that pain away. Availible in THC or CBD, Oil or Lotion.
293 2018-09-17 23:18:35 i need to get my oil changed when i get paid 
294 2018-09-17 23:18:26 I can never keep my braids in as long as I want. Pretty sure it’s because of this scalp growth oil and gummy hair vitamins.
295 2018-09-17 23:18:23 Stop warmongering for Israel, Genie oil and MIC and banksters!
296 2018-09-17 23:18:17 @kochie_online Not buying into the Koch Bros. latest ad about tariffs. I have been wanting a president to stand up to the Chinese for 20 years. I own oil company stocks and a family farm. I support President Trump in standing up to China. Your $ cannot buy everyone.
297 2018-09-17 23:18:12 So by World Leaders, you must mean invade every country with oil or land we need to run pipelines though? They turned M4A to "affordable" healthcare and dropped single payer. Nah.  No, thanks.
298 2018-09-17 23:18:01 I’d love to see this used for measuring fugitive emissions from oil fields or identifying fugitive leaks from within a refinery
299 2018-09-17 23:17:58 When we can't maintain our refinaries you are recommending building offshore. This is a battle we have lossed. The world has moved on and we are left behind. With massive research in alternative sources of energy and green revolution, just a matter of time oil will worth noting
300 2018-09-17 23:17:46 ましゅまろにきたお題の構図がおもいつかない
301 2018-09-17 23:17:35 That's what your oil filter said when you thought you tightened it at HQ 
302 2018-09-17 23:17:29 If you think real conservatives are against this, you’re wrong. I would love to see the Saudis’ pay for their role. Now that Trump has made to US the strongest oil exporter in the world. Maybe they will. As long as the swamp is strong I won’t hold my breath.
303 2018-09-17 23:17:11 We're gonna get fishy this week. We are going to talk Salmon Oil, Cod Oil, Krill Oil and Coconut Oil. Stay tuned to get the not so skinny in these oils and which one is the right one for your fur baby! See you tomorrow.
304 2018-09-17 23:17:09 Biden talking about Conservatives using terms like, them, they, those people. 
Lecturing on how supposedly Conservatives use terms like , them,  they and those people. 
Not very bright.
305 2018-09-17 23:16:48 Is CBD oil available wherever you’re at? It’s not the cannabis itself, just a derivative sleep aid that a lot of lifters use for muscle recovery. Works wonders and is cheap.
306 2018-09-17 23:16:41 Hi Georgina! No...I've mixed it with water but never tried oil. And dates...I love them!! Sounds tasty!! #MuchLove 
307 2018-09-17 23:16:31 No the president selectively declassified document that would help him personally, all the years of your BS "America democracy loving constitutionalist" just another 2 bit snake oil salesman living with no morals or convictions to make a buck #Loser

312 2018-09-17 23:16:02 What a joke to smear a guy in the 11th hour
313 2018-09-17 23:15:59 Check your Engine oil this morning.
314 2018-09-17 23:15:56 Guyana got robbed for gold by Canada & the oil is next because the government just tryna line their pockets. Try again...
315 2018-09-17 23:15:51 sometimes peppermint essential oil helps me, if it doesn’t help with the headache it’ll generally get me to relax :/
316 2018-09-17 23:15:51 It will end whenever the rulers of Venezuela allow the Rothschilds and Rockefellers to plunder their oil.
317 2018-09-17 23:15:44 Describe olive oil tasting, sluuurrrrppppp. Right, sir?

319 2018-09-17 23:15:27 When the gnus follow the bottle of oil, it is because they think house will be thrown into the boudoir.
320 2018-09-17 23:15:24 When was the last time you looked and changed your car oil? 
#Car #CarCare #Warranty #Oil
321 2018-09-17 23:15:07 This is actually a great sign. Not only does it again reaffirm @Tesla ‘s mission statement, it shows big oil’s affirmation of it. This “rising tide raises all ships” and right now @Tesla has the most buoyant ships!
322 2018-09-17 23:14:48 
323 2018-09-17 23:14:31 my car needs an oil change, im literally fucked

326 2018-09-17 23:14:02 lavender oil is soooooo bomb
327 2018-09-17 23:13:51 I found an old birthday cheque for 50$ when I was cleaning so I can finally get an oil change on my car, orrrr I can go get that new breeze. I think we all know which one I'm gonna choose

OIL！
329 2018-09-17 23:13:44 Omg I thought I was the only one, things like jollof and oil rice etc I think because they were broke and just mixed the ingredients together and magic came
330 2018-09-17 23:13:31 Good luck this year kid , loving the flow takes me back to the Gretzky days , go Oil

333 2018-09-17 23:12:53 If you can relate to these words in Kiswahili (Swahili) then you can pick up very easily. Nyama ya mbuzi > goat meat. Mafuta > oil, fat. Ulimi > tongue. Moyo > heart. Mbili > two. Nywele > Hair. Ndovu > Elephant, Nyati > Buffalo. Baba > Father. Lastly Kuku > Chicken... &many more
334 2018-09-17 23:12:49 Trynna drive with this baby oil all over my hands is a dangerous sport

338 2018-09-17 23:12:26 Bugs, sugar, dirt, leaves, fruit roll ups, a drop of oil next to a drop of water, a grape, fruit seeds, ice, freeze pops are kind of amazing to look at up close too with the crystal structures.
A slice of sourdough bread, yarn, cork, an ant, a potato chip, salt next to sugar.
339 2018-09-17 23:12:19 We reckon the select committee considering legislative changes to oil & gas exploration should meet in Taranaki so the local community & workers can have their say. We've written to MPs asking for this in the interests of fairness, democracy & natural justice. What do you think?
340 2018-09-17 23:12:08 oh that sweet almond oil too, run it..
341 2018-09-17 23:11:56 I’m really glad I bought this 3 gallon bottle of coconut oil so I could make my food taste like laundry detergent that one time
342 2018-09-17 23:11:26 how about switching asap to Hemp? Hemp plastic, hemp oil, hemp fabric, hemp glass, etc It's not only recyclable, it takes 3-6 months to decompose completely and its non polluting.
343 2018-09-17 23:10:57 True

Got me off Xanax

Slept so much better on CBD oil
344 2018-09-17 23:10:55 But thinking about cool lava lamps... what about black wax, a more cylindrical bottle shape, and metal stuff at the top and bottom that looks phyrexian. 

Tank of suspended Glistening oil.
345 2018-09-17 23:10:50 Simone owes me a new oil burner , ever since her big ass knocked mine down i can’t smell it nomore 
346 2018-09-17 23:10:49 @realDonaldTrump we are pumping out massive amounts of oil in the U.S. Can we get gas prices down in all states. Except California, they are screwed no matter what thanks to their shady state government. Please and thank you!
347 2018-09-17 23:10:45 big pharma hates CBD oil and other natural remedies that work just as good if not better than there drugs, and no side effects either
348 2018-09-17 23:10:37 Which mistake was that? Voting for the candidate who actually supported a $15 minimum wage, a just transition to 100% clean renewable energy by 2030, a Green New Deal, abolishing private prisons, ending foreign wars for oil...
349 2018-09-17 23:10:36 Finally got an oil change 
350 2018-09-17 23:10:36 エルザー　何怒ってんだよー？

354 2018-09-17 23:09:53 My car has idiot lights for everything, but it can run troublingly low on oil and no notification. Mini coopers  “consume” oil. 
355 2018-09-17 23:09:32 انتي ايش دراك؟ ماغيرك الكذوب العالم كلها تقول في دبي ماجبت شي من كيسي قال كذبتي قال َقال كندا قال؟ تخلف

358 2018-09-17 23:08:55 How was it cooked? Roasted in olive oil? Everything is so simple and delicious in Italy
359 2018-09-17 23:08:50 A man in 1750 BCE would have to work 50 hrs to read w 1 hr of light using sesame oil; 1800 6 hrs for 1 hr of a tallow candle; 1880 15 min w kerosene lamp; 1950 8 sec w incandescent bulb; 1994 1/2 second for an hr w a compact fluorescent. What a world we are privileged live in.

それはとってもメンタルやられますねーーーwwwww
361 2018-09-17 23:08:39 True. 93% of drop in income tax revenue was due to the *international* oil industry crash. But there's no data yet on 2017 Cdn tax rate. Anomalous 2016 data says high income earners were able to avoid Liberals tax reforms before they were implemented at year end.

363 2018-09-17 23:08:34 Screw oil money clubs that buy titles. I happen to like the competition Real Madrid gives us every season.
364 2018-09-17 23:08:08 Mine got a gnarly keloid. It’s half gone in 3-4 days just from putting tea tree oil on it
365 2018-09-17 23:08:02 Did you know that production of polypropylene starts with crude oil which is distilled into naphtha? I came across this when  searching for chemicals used in medical devices,
366 2018-09-17 23:07:55 cassin/downes have the similar self heal once a battle and i can 2lb and unlock the skill in the retrofit tree and not complete the kai conversion for more oil saving
367 2018-09-17 23:07:34 An increase in population and electrical demand will mean more electricity usage. Which makes it important for platforms like ours, aiming to increase renewable energy generation and supply.

369 2018-09-17 23:07:29 Same with my bike. The oil filter is above the four header pipes. 
370 2018-09-17 23:07:20 Ha ha ha ha ha ohhh ohh God has blessed us with this Brave economist who's study in entire political science is going to be put in use. He's decided to take on the growing oil prices by himself. Ha ha ha.
371 2018-09-17 23:07:12 cedarwood essential oil is really good to treat spot acne btw!!! :)
372 2018-09-17 23:06:55 So given that oil is a finite resource, we should just enjoy schools, hospitals and fire fighters while we've got them? That's what your saying?

You'll forgive us for wanting a bit more than that for our friends, family and neighbours.
373 2018-09-17 23:06:44 Yes, this entire box is filled with Champlain!  Also coming Chocolate, Raw Silk, Sterling, Little Lamb, Ultra Grip.

375 2018-09-17 23:06:38 Enbridge's deadline for their mandatory disclosure of corporate info behind the sale of Line 10 oil pipeline is Sept 18. I am looking forward to reading it. Just.  Google Enbridge Line 10 sale to get to the NEB page about it.

377 2018-09-17 23:06:13 I know how to change a tire, I know how to do a oil change on my own car, but that’s just basic things you SHOULD know how to do.

383 2018-09-17 23:05:33  amazon’s prices went up because of the hurricane. I desperately need to order avocado oil and a protein treatment for my hair
384 2018-09-17 23:05:32 Tea tree oil from Body Shop! That won't disappoint
385 2018-09-17 23:05:08 The pharmacy Insurense have all you big rich republicans bought, so do not continue you work for big oil companies, and insurance, only this country lets them get away with price  increase, they ask for increase and government allows it.

392 2018-09-17 23:04:11 The new cohosts of GBBo (great British bake off ) ironically, are kind of oil and water...... they don’t mix!
393 2018-09-17 23:04:04 I have an Accord. My dad used to have a BMW 3 Series, but you had to take it in for all kinds of normal stuff (he's the kinda of guy who like to changes his own oil, etc). We've been Japanese since.
394 2018-09-17 23:03:57 @ChrisGPackham the palm oil industry. So, so sad. This prog is one of the saddest I have seen.
395 2018-09-17 23:03:16 I mean, if you're basically chugging down oil and straight-up preservatives as food, you can just about switch to anything and be better off.

402 2018-09-17 23:02:37 Also, Putin wants Venz oil to go away as that prod difference does change oil price. China wants to keep the patient alive as they have opposing positions
403 2018-09-17 23:02:34 Guy who changed my oil today was hot, so naturally I ended up spending  $70 extra on things he recommended 
404 2018-09-17 23:02:24 Pls do!
405 2018-09-17 23:02:21 No oil, just water and oxygen.
406 2018-09-17 23:01:57 Doesn’t really matter who it is they’re still kicking the shit out of someone
407 2018-09-17 23:01:42 So yeah, the podcast isn't going away, I'll be back to twittering about it and trying to schmooze with others when I have something I feel proud about. The formula isn't locked down yet and I'm tired of shouting about my own snake oil.
408 2018-09-17 23:01:29 The more tightly your clothing fits against your body, the more it will trap dirt, oil &amp; sweat on your skin, which could cause body acne.

ツバキ科、種子。ホホバオイルとオリーブオイルと共に、世界の3大オイル。85%以上がオレイン酸。保湿、肌を柔らかくする。浸透力は優れている。ヘアケアに最適。使い心地はやや粘性があり、滑らか。酸化しにくい。
412 2018-09-17 23:00:57 These countries have extreme wealth. The end of oil has begun. Those with the most $ at the end will control the next resource to sell, or at least that’s the plan. World autocratic rule will make that much easier to achieve.
413 2018-09-17 23:00:49 The only way I’m doing that is if I try to keep custody no need to change, i just use used oil from work to fill it.
414 2018-09-17 23:00:45 #DebateQC Will Quebec still be in the oil and Gas extraction business in the next few years? With the liberals and the CAQ, the answer is yes.
Under my leadership, the PQ has made a clean break from oil and gas.
In French or in English it is the only planet we have! @jflisee
415 2018-09-17 23:00:40 Diffusing some essential oils. Today’s oil is Hope. “It reminds us that the beauty of life is only yet to be discovered.” 
416 2018-09-17 23:00:38 And if it’s from taxed income you have to earn.....oh, you do the maths. And the oil company has to pay tax on the profit bit of the 50-odd pence.
417 2018-09-17 23:00:32 Argentina aim to double oil & gas production in 5 yrs, create 500,000 new jobs in Vaca Muerte and speed up renewables projects to cover 20% of electricity production. Equinor is an active player with drilling activity and our first solar project#energyofthefuture

420 2018-09-17 23:00:24 I thought more oil meant lower prices. (I knew they were lying.) Collusion on oil prices --GREED-- is one factor destoying economic growth for the middle and lower class. Now they want to pillage more pristine natural resources.  #No #LoseLose

430 2018-09-17 22:58:55 Can you say criminal conspiracy or as I like to say Treason. They should all be prosecuted for capital crimes. Oil that hemp!
431 2018-09-17 22:58:53 Or Brian Stetler?
432 2018-09-17 22:58:50 Caster oil and more, but yeah mainly that...
433 2018-09-17 22:58:49 They mean nothing because they don't show the true figures that an indy Scot would raise. So much of Scotland's resources/assets aren't attributed to Scotland's books within the UK. Oil from our waters, not all is attributed to Scotland's books.

439 2018-09-17 22:57:40 You realize Canada has the third largest oil reserves in the world, right? Venezuela is out of the game. Internal chaos. Selling their oil to print more money. Saudi’s then Canada. Who helped Trump steal presidential election? Russia, Saudi’s, UAE, Isreal. Coincidence?
440 2018-09-17 22:57:38 Never mix business with pleasure...thats like mixing water and oil
441 2018-09-17 22:57:38 Why are we getting our oil from Saudi Arabia instead of Alberta? Albertans are pissed off and with good reason

443 2018-09-17 22:57:21 The UK govt decided to let the oil revenues go to oil companies. 

Unlike sensible countries like Norway.
444 2018-09-17 22:57:20 Why are you giving press time to this monster? He killed his wife and strangled his daughters and dumped them in an oil vat. The family left behind deserve the press and they are devastated not depressed
445 2018-09-17 22:57:05 Literally had a full cart of oil and this shit broke. That’s BS
446 2018-09-17 22:57:00 Asset sale coming for #PTR

447 2018-09-17 22:56:57 I’ve never heard of shito oil before!
448 2018-09-17 22:56:43 Hahaha always start by asking me questions about the army then start telling me If look good in oil ffs i dont send noodz pmsl
449 2018-09-17 22:56:33 i'd love to do oil painting but everytime i think about it, supplies come into mind and i immediately get turned off.. Why is there so many different oil painting "mediums" that all do different things 
450 2018-09-17 22:56:30 $0.16 an hour, outrageous!!!
 I will pay no more than 8 with free health care. 
Now we just need to find doctors that will work for 16 cents an hour. 
Ain't Socialism great.
451 2018-09-17 22:56:29 Funded by dirty oil money.. nice.
452 2018-09-17 22:56:15 It works every time!

455 2018-09-17 22:55:52 I was speaking to a dental hygenist and she told me that fermented cod liver oil actually reversed cavities in her two young nieces. She thinks it some kind of vitamin deficiency and sugar that causes cavity.
456 2018-09-17 22:55:34 great  let s set a date and place! X
457 2018-09-17 22:55:33 You know what sort of complex dish sounds good right now? A pan crust pizza with a vodka sauce, mozzarella, anchovies, pepperoni, black olives, and some fresh basil on top <3 With olive oil drizzled on afterwards.
458 2018-09-17 22:55:29 Man, I don't know, don't even eat that much 
459 2018-09-17 22:55:25 When I get too come home from the oil field I'm getting tatted up

463 2018-09-17 22:55:01 The answer will always be the oil money boys lol...just like Chelsea Abromavich era in the chase of CL, they are all chasing that elusive elite trophy for bragging rights beyond mere league titles.
464 2018-09-17 22:54:59 Something I've found very helpful is using Azulene Oil as the final step after my sensitive skin aftershave balm. Shaving sucks.
465 2018-09-17 22:54:59 Gas is frightening. I only wish we had been more focused on how natural gas was going to be the menace that it is 25 years ago. GAS IS THE PAST! Keep the OIL IN THE SOIL!
466 2018-09-17 22:54:54 Oil field trash ain’t so bad tho 
467 2018-09-17 22:54:46 It's a scary phase.

475 2018-09-17 22:53:44 setting pools of oil and blood on fire? in a tomb raider game? it’s more likely than you think
476 2018-09-17 22:53:40 Now you are passed that where are you headed
477 2018-09-17 22:53:31 A6. Run, jump, walk, sleep well, wake up without feeling like The Tin Man without oil. But I hope I’d be more active. #CreakyChats
478 2018-09-17 22:53:31 Alright oil tweeps. I have 15 Jerseys, none of them current Oilers. Who should I get next ?
479 2018-09-17 22:53:30 I am fat now bro, so taking my shirt off is off the table at the moment.
480 2018-09-17 22:53:25 I used that toner as well. Works pretty well. Olay breaks me out for some reason. I switched up my lotion products and the frequency and it’s always the same. I’m looking for a product that reduces oil that’s aside from what i already use to moisturize
481 2018-09-17 22:53:15 CBD oil is legal in most places. It does not contain THC, so it does not cause a high or cause a positive on a drug test. It has therapeutic effects for anxiety, depression, & pain.
I use an oil derived from hemp which is THC free & I love sharing it!
Good luck & God bless!

484 2018-09-17 22:52:24 No it's the other way round, they asked me where the relationship was heading, when I didn't even know where my life was heading. Damn!! I hate early 20s.
485 2018-09-17 22:52:23 why do you put oil in bread?
486 2018-09-17 22:52:21 CBD hemp oil effects can be felt within as little as 20 minutes.  4 days in and pain is at a level where I could cry.
Was as well had spent price of the very expensive little bottle on a spliff and got high

490 2018-09-17 22:52:14 Ever notice how nobody has bad skin in old oil paintings, even though they never bathed? There's a reason for that. Pimples were invented by the CIA in 1963 in an attempt to make hippies too embarrassed to attend anti-war protests.
491 2018-09-17 22:52:09 I use....

- Neutrogena Oil Free Face Wash 
- Noxzema
- Rodan and Fields Unblemish
- Sea Breeze Astringent
492 2018-09-17 22:52:04 You need to do more songs and try taking off your shirt in your next video.
493 2018-09-17 22:52:00 i spilt my frickin farsali facial oil everywhere 
494 2018-09-17 22:51:47 Slice it in half, smother it in olive oil and a dash of garlic and bake it! It's a new way to bake dirigibles.
495 2018-09-17 22:51:44 Omg!! Yes please update me. Also i love the custom CBD essential oil 
496 2018-09-17 22:51:39 ? You must be mistaken .. .. we export our oil at 39 a barrel and import at world market rates at around 65 .   So either your knowledge is lacking or what I just read is wrong
497 2018-09-17 22:51:36 You know how to stop this? Ban zebra crossings like how you ban oil pumps. 

Jokes aside, as a driver you should always slow down when approaching a crossing. The two pillars in your car are your biggest blind spots.
498 2018-09-17 22:51:30 I’ve been using vitamin e oil to try help the scars but it’s annoying cos the spots just come back and make more scars hopefully my hormones will level out & itll stop soon n same for u. But yeah the vitamin E is meant to be good
499 2018-09-17 22:51:28 The Government owns all the natural resources. Oil, Gold, Timber. But they have a real democracy where the guy with the most votes actually is the winner. The economy is exploding. like most of Asia. American businesses like Trump exploit the labor because it is cheap.
500 2018-09-17 22:51:22 Some or only ?
501 2018-09-17 22:51:17 idk why people are so rude about acne??? i’m a teenager, it’s normal. i drink 3 32oz bottles of water each day, i wash my face twice a day, i moisturize 3 times a day, and i use tea tree oil on spots... acne is natural and i can’t control it

503 2018-09-17 22:51:10 That’s wonderful! What a wonderful feeling and a reminder to enjoy every second you can with your beloved pets - and spoil the SHIT out of them; they didn’t choose you, and  and they have no choices in life. They’re there for YOU. Spoil them rotten!
504 2018-09-17 22:51:05 And will come their response to ban the supply chain to US and may be even Rare earth materials and if push comes to shove treasuries since they proved that they don't care much about CNY/USD so long as CNY is as good as gold for oil theme. Will be oje exciting few months ahead.
505 2018-09-17 22:51:01 I swear by lavender oil. I've seen it do some really awesome stuff in regards to speeding healing. Peppermint oil has also worked well on mosquito bites.
506 2018-09-17 22:50:56 This booty hasn’t seen oil in like 2years Ayeeeee 
507 2018-09-17 22:50:55 A few drops of oil in a body of water will cause a tremendous amount of sheen on it's surface, eventually killing the fishes beneath.
508 2018-09-17 22:50:41 We were also told demand was to go up, which was false, that oil would be $150-$200/bbl longterm creating markets for power sales in US & also would make HTG too expensive. Shale gas revolution was dismissed. 2041 option was all we needed in reality.
509 2018-09-17 22:50:39 It’s about time we got together again and blockaded the oil refineries, bringing the country to a standstill instead of rolling over and being ripped off
510 2018-09-17 22:50:36 The right response is to stop Trans Mountain Pipeline in its tracks, not throw more good money after bad forcing approval through and building a pipeline using taxpayer money against the will of so many Canadians. Will the feds cancel oil company subsidies as promised?
511 2018-09-17 22:50:25 Salt and olive oil, you can use it on your body, or you can dip bread in it and eat.

516 2018-09-17 22:49:51 You broke the hearts of some of your would be female fans.
517 2018-09-17 22:49:40 turns out you can make healthy food taste good by drenching it in oil, butter, salt, spices & sauces, effectively make them unhealthy :)))
518 2018-09-17 22:49:39 The frame on this oil painting got a makeover! The brown wasn’t doing it justice, so I added a deep orange to make it pop! Swipe for more photos, including the before! $24.95 plus ship! Headed to my shoppe soon! Link in profile. I do appreciate your time and consideration!

527 2018-09-17 22:48:40 Canada can and should supply it’s ethically produced oil to meet that requirement.
528 2018-09-17 22:48:37 Depends on many factors. Vaping cannabis oil depends a lot on the extraction method and if it's mixed with VG, PG, or artificial flavors may not be the best choice for everyone.
529 2018-09-17 22:48:34 Shame on you. Nobody would give a damn shit about Venezuela if they didn't have LOTS OF OIL.
530 2018-09-17 22:48:32 “cheese is so bad for you. eat a vegan substitute.” 

i’m pretty sure the coconut oil in daiya “cheese” is no better and has even more saturated fat. so shut up.

555 2018-09-17 22:45:25 We didn’t have to use our phones, buy oil, listen to the radio or watch TV. That doesn’t mean I’m not glad Ma Bell and Standard oil were forced to give up their monopoly and the FCC regulated the air waves against unfair political biase. This is one of the things gov Should do
556 2018-09-17 22:45:11 who got oil for a dab pen 
557 2018-09-17 22:45:07 @realDonaldTrump It's TIME TO BUILD THE WALL! GOD said to  BUILD IT TO PROTECT AMERICA! GOD w CLEAN UP U.S. DEBT when U.S. & Israel has all the OIL in the WORLD. Satan/Dems know his time is short & will do everything to win this election. WE MUST ACT LIKE THIS IS OUR LAST!!
558 2018-09-17 22:45:06 British nationalists will consistently argue that a second independence referendum shows disrespect to democracy.

It's no wonder these same minds think an oil producing, net exporter of food & energy can't sustain itself. No ability to question, or a desire to see Scotland down.
559 2018-09-17 22:45:05 Thr way you're sinking you'll soon discover oil  brother 
560 2018-09-17 22:44:38 This wild growth oil got my hair growing so fast
561 2018-09-17 22:44:38 ...and the other 48%?
562 2018-09-17 22:44:36 So Westminster want Scotland shut out of the EU Brexit deal, want our farmers out of business, want our parliament powerless, want our produce branded British, want 45% of our oil attributed to another region. Remind me, how is this a union of equals? #DissolveTheUnion
563 2018-09-17 22:44:22 But substantial performance?
564 2018-09-17 22:44:17 Why though? You haven’t given one single reason. The Liberals support billionaire tax havens, pension theft, minimal climate action and billion dollar give aways to big oil every bit as much as the Conservatives do. How could Trudeau’s Liberals not be regressive enough for you?
565 2018-09-17 22:44:12 Chai !!!!
566 2018-09-17 22:44:10 We'll still all to play for.. Can't help but say the 2nd half of the season in the big meetings the engine room has gone missing  . Should never if changed the oil 
567 2018-09-17 22:44:00 Ah, I pretty much do the same thing exceptI do olive oil, salt, garlic and kyan if i have any. I f not cracked black pepper or just pepper. Sounds good though.
568 2018-09-17 22:43:52 Generally, no specific performance in services contracts. Remedy is usually damages.
569 2018-09-17 22:43:26 If you read the entire thread here, the reason I went to twitter because the dealer is insisting that an oil change is needed and couldn't explain, to my satisfaction why it needed to be changed if the gas engine is not actually being used for > 90% of the miles.
570 2018-09-17 22:43:19 The only way the antigens in vaccines will cause antibody production is if they are combined with potent irritants.  These irritants, called adjuvants include aluminum, peanut oil, fetal cell fragments.  Some immune systems have the right size reaction. Some over react.
571 2018-09-17 22:43:08 I agree with the Oilers fans on my TL right now that knew @drtwofive would be back with the @EdmontonOilers sooner rather than later. It's a business I am happy the two sides worked things out. A contract dispute would have done nobody any good the Oil need him!!! Great signing!!
572 2018-09-17 22:43:03 Along with some fabulous oil
573 2018-09-17 22:42:54 Alisa: can you open up the coconut oil?

Normal response: yeah, sure.

Actual response: Coconup the openut oil? Sure
574 2018-09-17 22:42:43 @LiberalQuebec privatize oil research on Anticosti Island, let's remember!

575 2018-09-17 22:42:31 So good just saying been using magnesium oil and is very good 
576 2018-09-17 22:42:27 Me cagaron la primavera
577 2018-09-17 22:42:22 Ahwell I think I just ruined a pair of pants with motor oil...
578 2018-09-17 22:42:14 getting burned by an oil splash while frying something.
579 2018-09-17 22:42:04 It's not true what Couillard said, liberals start to take out oil of Anticosti, not PQ #polqc #debateQC
580 2018-09-17 22:41:54 Haven't a clue about Salmond, he's no longer part of Scottish Gov. We don't need oil, we have plenty other natural resources.We don't like Westminster but we do not hate the English.  In fact English people are a very big part of the independence movement #EnglishScotsforYes
581 2018-09-17 22:41:46 @waitrose encouraged to see commitment to reduce plastic and packaging by 2019. What about getting rid of palm oil from your own brand products and supporting our rain forests? #rainforest #PalmOil #orangutans #orangutanjungleschool @wwf_uk

583 2018-09-17 22:41:38 Tried out oil paint today
584 2018-09-17 22:41:10 MrLegault, instead of talking about the PAST, how about telling us what you intend to do=
 go ahead with oil & gaz explotation, just like PLQ. 
#debateQC
585 2018-09-17 22:41:08 I really like the Moonchild gloss from the Kathleen collection! Any of their new Ultra Glossy Lips are really good because they all contain jojoba oil
586 2018-09-17 22:41:00 what’s the best way to get rid of fake tan please??? I’ve tried baby oil and it’s got off some but there’s still some left 
587 2018-09-17 22:40:59 Is Barney in concussion protocol as a precaution?
588 2018-09-17 22:40:58 That’s what you don’t understand.-you’re not improving anything. Just trading four quarters for a dollar (or CND oil for Foriegn). You’re trying to handcuff the wealth of your nation for NO ENVIRONMENTAL gain and to increase the wealth of other nations.What are you accomplishing?
589 2018-09-17 22:40:48 Traeger: hairdryer with hamster pellets
Electric smoker: Someone saw a wine fridge and got bored

590 2018-09-17 22:40:39 My brother is a pipeline scheduler for a gas/oil company. Kids probably having a HELL of a day today trying to reroute fuel for everyone in NC
591 2018-09-17 22:40:37 The CAQ, PLQ and PQ are all open, to varying degrees, to oil exploitation and exploration. Can we trust them to lead the fight agains't climat change? #debateqc #PVQ #polqc #environment
592 2018-09-17 22:40:34 Oil makes ya fat!
593 2018-09-17 22:40:33 Thought Singapore would be blue . But there is blue Brunei (oil) Panama (canal?) and Trinidad (not an oil heavyweight ?)
594 2018-09-17 22:40:26 Why I actually actively am hostile to the GOP in general as of late: no party rebellion against it, just money from Oil tycoons and Plutocrats trying to pull “i got mine, fuck you”
595 2018-09-17 22:40:25 ナルルちゃんは素直で可愛いなー。誰かさんもあれぐらい素直だったらいいんだけどなー
596 2018-09-17 22:40:16 Organic Acv!! 1 tbs In the morning and at night. Helps regulate, helps you digest and blast belly fat.
I'm also a very oily girl and this was the only thing that helped to decrease the oil on my face.
597 2018-09-17 22:40:10 What about Lord of Snake Oil or is it too similar to Duke of Fraud? Or Lord of Traitors maybe?
598 2018-09-17 22:40:08 油揚げって言うほど油って感じしなくない？ほんとに騙された気分だよ。
599 2018-09-17 22:39:58 In those Dawn commercials where they're washing oil off of baby ducks, if they don't like the first take... Do they cover it in oil again?

Seriously how do they make those ads?
600 2018-09-17 22:39:43 I just lit my stress relief candle and turned on my diffuser with lavender essential oil. I'm about to be knocked out.
601 2018-09-17 22:39:42 Getting my oil changed at a place airing Fox News is hell
602 2018-09-17 22:39:42 okay so i just got a free oil change and tire rotation bc they took hella long doing it 
603 2018-09-17 22:39:39 This oil man tried to force me into giving him my number while I'm on the train. On top of that, when he was talking, his spit flew on my chin. I am disgusted.
604 2018-09-17 22:39:32 The only association Cramer has with oil is to cash Harold Hamm’s checks. If he had his way, Cramer would give Hamm naming rights to ND for all the cash he’s given!
605 2018-09-17 22:39:07 Bro I’m just tryna get an oil change
606 2018-09-17 22:39:04 -Dad was a petroleum engineer. Honest don't know what that means but something to do w/ figuring out getting oil out of the ground. He took me to the office when I was young & tried to explain it to me. Even drew me pictures (usually works). Nope. Don't get it-
607 2018-09-17 22:39:01 Another reason why I won’t be voting for Labour again. How many Unite members work in the oil & gas industry again?
608 2018-09-17 22:38:31 The oil is 40ml and says 37g also same issue with the seeds. Is that per seed, pack of 4
609 2018-09-17 22:38:30 Bacon fat is my favorite essential oil!
610 2018-09-17 22:37:59 Gall, audacity, nerve, obsequiousness, plus light disdain and sweet disdain (light and sweet crude oil) 
611 2018-09-17 22:37:45 Got home not too long ago & realised that I left my meds in the office.

Well oil beef hooked!!
612 2018-09-17 22:37:43 supply-side activism for commodities that trade on a world-market is terrible marginal use resources. 

The BEST use of activist resources is with market action in reducing demand for oil and other pollutants by reducing meat/dairy. Real immediate effects yo
613 2018-09-17 22:37:36 I like Five Guys french fries- they’re fried in peanut oil! 
614 2018-09-17 22:37:12 when my hair was long i would wash it every day, never blowdry it, use argan oil in it. maybe spritz it with water!!
615 2018-09-17 22:37:10 World oil pricing began dropping in 2014, 2 years before the Liberals took office. It has little to do with Canada & everything to do with a glut of oil reserves, overproduction & low demand for our high-sulpher bitumen. It's proof that petro-states are vulnerable to free markets
616 2018-09-17 22:37:05 おなかが痛い……
617 2018-09-17 22:37:01 A PORTA RICAN PASTOR #DENNISROJAS HAD A CHURCH ABOUT 12YRS AGO HIS CHURCH THE BIBLE WAS DRIPPING OIL MIXED W WINE W PEARLS A TRASH BARREL THE BIBLE WAS N PRISTINE SHAPE THE SAME THING W THIS CHURCH N #GEORGIA BIBLE SOAKING N THE OIL ITS DRIPPING
618 2018-09-17 22:36:52 The thing they don't tell you is that you have to rub the kale with a bit of salt until it "wilts". Then add dressing like oil and lemon. Delicious and easily consumed.
619 2018-09-17 22:36:27 I kno I just got a oil change lmao just gotta make sure...
620 2018-09-17 22:36:25 No no, fair enough... I just hadn’t really heard of a lot of oil contaminated ducks from tailing ponds.
621 2018-09-17 22:36:05 That's only the HEALTHIEST OIL on the planet! extra virgin olive oil
622 2018-09-17 22:35:50 Mine had the plugged PVC orifice problem. Blew the main seal and dumped all my oil on the highway in -20 temps last Dec.  This is a known defect of the ecotec engine, my make and model should be part of the defect warrantee, my VIN wasn’t included. This will be my last GM vehicle
623 2018-09-17 22:35:36 People are dumb. Chavez gave you Maduro. He stripped bare the oil operations and left the country poor as shit.
624 2018-09-17 22:35:30 Use lavender oil - keeps them away and helps bites heal faster. I swear by it - use it on myself and my 5yo - mosquitoes love us.
625 2018-09-17 22:35:28 Read the same things about the kid and has all the tools. It's crazy how he managed to stay realitively healthy playing football & it has been the complete opposite playing ball. Further proof that baseball is far more stressful on the body to play than many believe.
626 2018-09-17 22:35:10 Under Nixon you got stagnant inflation and low growth and loss of competition and most of all that when Japan rampage with imports so you are very wrong then under carter who inherited bad economic problems it got even more worse plus under ford Nixon cater huge oil spikes
627 2018-09-17 22:34:52 And that’s all natural brightening items. And apply coconut oil after. My mama think that’s why I’m getting lighter, I put coconut oil on every morning and night.
628 2018-09-17 22:34:48 Okay, quick thought before I get this fish in oil.

Wizarding photographs are just physical gifs, correct? Imagine with me: WWW has the hottest new shit, instead of famous witch and wizard cards in chocolate frogs, they sell cards with gifs on them .
629 2018-09-17 22:34:34 Globalists were setting up an oil pipeline from SA to EU, Human Trafficking lines through Turkey and Malta, across the border to the South and further.
Do you even have a grasp on what it means to be a Globalist? -EVERY- agenda a Globalist has he is oppositional of. You are wrong
630 2018-09-17 22:34:28 Modern day journalism as well as journalist have become nothing more than liars and snake oil salesmen. I wonder if the world will ever recover from the damage they have been causing for the last decade.
631 2018-09-17 22:34:25 Maracuja oil is the miracle oil of my life
632 2018-09-17 22:34:21 I was told coconut oil would help my beard, will it also help fix my life? (asking for a friend)
633 2018-09-17 22:34:20 We can put a rover on Mars, but we can’t come up with a compostable alternative to plastic? Can you say, oil companies?!
634 2018-09-17 22:34:17 Who's wages? Not my wages.
Your wages? Private prison owners wages? Big oil wages? Military contract wages?
Because certainly not my wages.
635 2018-09-17 22:34:15 I sleep with virgin olive oil on every night and wake up with baby soft skin 
636 2018-09-17 22:34:06 Yeah...this one broke me...next one I leave....
637 2018-09-17 22:34:06 The fact that i watched Brad drink the garlic oil off the top of an uncooked garlic pizza bread makes me actually vom... NOPE
638 2018-09-17 22:33:52 The “wellness” vitamins from Whole Foods are a great place to start. If you’re really feeling it, cod liver oil, garlic, zinc, and vitamin A & D (usually offered as a combo) are my go-to. 
639 2018-09-17 22:33:50 90% rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle. You can also add essential oil for fragrance if you like
640 2018-09-17 22:33:46 One point to clarify since I am from the oil & gas industry - The gas prices at the time were actually going down and its lowest in recent history- currently they are on the up and near to the avergae high hence prices rises all over the world
641 2018-09-17 22:33:45 Coconut oil will give me carpal tunnel #youwontgoblind
642 2018-09-17 22:33:42 AsjklajdhsomgI’ve heard of castor oil or whatever but it makes sense why V would work. It coats them & protects them?
643 2018-09-17 22:33:39 I'm not at all religious but the fact that he walks the walk seems to be to his credit.
644 2018-09-17 22:33:31 I need assembly hymns back in my life I can’t listen to anymore notices or about lanyards just sing — give me oil in my lamp keep me burning. Give me oil In my lamp I prayyyy
645 2018-09-17 22:33:29 Kids don't pay $200+/game to go watch an ineptly managed product.
Adults have every right to be frustrated when their teams, that THEY pay to support, are run as the Oil have been recently.
Hell, we almost lost the Flames 20 years ago because of awful management/teams
646 2018-09-17 22:33:21 Property is bought, not earned, and those who pay the fruits of their labor for property the owner did nothing to produce (farmland, oil fields, forests, etc) are among the worst victims of capitalists. You shouldn’t work for someone else to be able to provide for yourself.
647 2018-09-17 22:33:17 oregano oil from the vitamin shoppe!!
648 2018-09-17 22:33:15 Hot oil treatment really?
649 2018-09-17 22:33:05 Cute seeing you..if only I wasn’t vinegar and you oil.
650 2018-09-17 22:32:43 And there’s a whole lotta people on the right ready to cave on this right now, as if the tactic won’t be lathered, rinsed, and repeated. We are through the looking glass.
651 2018-09-17 22:32:37 I’ll never use another oil brand again 
Liqui Moly never rose over 220 degrees and it’s been at 245 
652 2018-09-17 22:32:35 Do you mean the climate is changing? Not according to POTUS, keep burning them fossil fuels, at least the oil companies make generous donations to the GOP.

656 2018-09-17 22:31:53 every high school should have a mandatory class called 
"Life"
w/c teaches u how to sew, change tire/oil, do taxes, make money, basic 1st aid, basic cooking etc. 
Basic things that u need in real Life.
657 2018-09-17 22:31:50 Wait, are you going to discover oil and move to Oklahoma?!

660 2018-09-17 22:31:29 Guessing the Oil were trying to get him to sign for 4+ at this kind of number?
Don't blame him for holding out ...
Hasn't proven himself to be worth the upper level D salaries, but too good to lock himself in too long.
661 2018-09-17 22:31:14 Don’t forget when you said I could oil you up, Joey
662 2018-09-17 22:31:13 My son makes me happy, my girl makes me happy, my family makes me happy, my friends make me happy... I’m so happy, I’m from the gutters, with a little bit of dirty oil in the gutters, the water will have rainbows
663 2018-09-17 22:31:07 We're on year 20 now! We have to seal up the cracks around the windows if we're going to so much as see each other in passing or for passers by it's like when they used to pour boiling oil out of gargoyles only worse

677 2018-09-17 22:29:11 Labour should apologise for robbing Scotland and giving our oil and waters to little england. Little brittas should apologise for raiding our oil and using our money to support it.
678 2018-09-17 22:28:54 Dear B.C. pipeline owners: John Horgan and the NDP have doubled the risk of oil spills by increasing oil transport by rail. You can send him your thanks for nothing to premier@gov.bc.ca.  #NDPFail #GreeNDPHypocrisy #bcpoli
679 2018-09-17 22:28:38 You can try it, start with the oil used in frying stuff.

686 2018-09-17 22:27:37 Sending Babe to get my Oil changed 
687 2018-09-17 22:27:31 A country that is self-sufficient is less likely to starve from outside sources being stingy or stifled in its production. The saudis have manipulated oil prices to cause Americans hardship and to force the US to change policy or go after enemies.
688 2018-09-17 22:27:19 The loss of tax revenue is due the income dropping not tax rate. 4.2 billion of that drop was in Alberta due to this governments handling of the oil sector.
689 2018-09-17 22:27:02 It hasn't stopped indefinitely & that Reuters story is not true. 

My friends in Aramco are still on the IPO. 

The IPO is delayed till they resolve the legal issues & hope for higher oil prices to raise valuation. The focus now is on the Sabic acquisition.
690 2018-09-17 22:26:50 I work for the biggest Oil Company in the world. Sometimes I just can’t go to work. Like today. #fucked
691 2018-09-17 22:26:36 Still not sure we are talking the same language. So being upset and caring about outcome is not okay?
What exactly will happen to this Oilers team if more fans follow your approach?
Unhappy? Walk away. The Oil would be long gone by that strategy.
692 2018-09-17 22:26:35 Man you have some serious work ethics. Bravo.
693 2018-09-17 22:26:28 TRY CBD OIL
694 2018-09-17 22:26:13 I really can’t wait to go home to my own house , turn on my oil essentials cook some dinner and watch tv with my baby
695 2018-09-17 22:26:06 Avocado oil mayo, squirt of mustard, old bay, salt. I eyeballed it.
696 2018-09-17 22:26:03 We extract the oil from the leaf.
697 2018-09-17 22:25:49 The only food I have in my house is olive oil, condiments, and a stale baguette, but I already took my pants off and you KNOW your boy isn’t putting those babies back on and I guess what I’m saying is GUESSWHO’SHAVINGCRUETONSFORDINNER
698 2018-09-17 22:25:21 You need to bring it up with STV, SKY and BBC as I saw it all on their news. Sturgeon was silly enough to believe Scotland could survive on N sea oil revenue. The Arabs could flood the Market with Oil tomorrow and ger estimates will drop through the floor .
699 2018-09-17 22:25:16 Get cbd oil instead. take it in a dropper by mouth. That’s what I do
700 2018-09-17 22:25:14 also: holy SHIT walnut oil is apparently GREAT for seasoning cast iron

702 2018-09-17 22:25:00 I loved it! My Dad would run out and roll his eyes at me  I’ve been using Nag Champa oil for the last decade. But, if I ever went back to a cologne...it would be Grey Flannel 
703 2018-09-17 22:24:59 Went to oreilys to get oil for an oil change and get asked on a date by a guy I haven’t seen since middle school

712 2018-09-17 22:23:42 Since their socialist government collapse and the people are starving I think a regime change for the people sakes is good.  Trump doesn't want their oil. Trump's a businessman.  He'd be more than happy to make a good deal with them. If all countries would make Fair deals=happy.
713 2018-09-17 22:23:40 A mix of jojoba and tea tree oil. Two pumps of jojoba and two drops of tea tree. It should also work as a natural repellent. Good luck!
714 2018-09-17 22:23:26 We all know that Scotland exports whisky, oil, water etc to England....& we're told that this will stop once we're independent (we know it won't ) but what comes the other way? What does England export to Scotland? Anyone know? I can't find anything out there of any importance?
715 2018-09-17 22:23:13 Can you send a link to the oil you use??
716 2018-09-17 22:23:11 if water and Oil DONT mix being messy and anointed WONT either 
717 2018-09-17 22:23:09 Oh, need to get the vehicle in for an oil change and tire rotation. I don't do that ish myself anymore.
718 2018-09-17 22:22:49 And i didn't realize the oil can be regulated. As in: very little "high" s/e and mostly therapeutic response.

724 2018-09-17 22:22:17 Well, once we ramp up #HempProduction, we can grow it all across our GREAT NATION and then make Oil based products locally, thereby creating local jobs, all across the nation and therefore not need to transport dirty yucky crude oil all over the place!!

725 2018-09-17 22:22:15 One is a make-your-own cloud thing, and the other is using oil, water, food colouring and salt to make lava-lamp type things. Those are so easy :) Then, also, I made a DIY operation game with a Makey Makey.
726 2018-09-17 22:22:12 Hey some motor oil from your mechanics. Works a hell of a lot better than CLP for keeping things running smooth.

735 2018-09-17 22:21:32 By 2050, just 32 years from now, Nigeria's population is projected to be 411 M (more than the US). Oil will no longer be relevant. The debt burden of China will become unbearable. Environmental degradation, food crisis, etc. Without visionary leadership, the future is BLEAK!
736 2018-09-17 22:21:29 I've got baby oil babe.

741 2018-09-17 22:20:43 Free markets? Didn't Trump just subsidize farming even more than it already is? What about Oil subsides? Free people? Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, West Virginia etc. have 15% of their population living in poverty...   REAL #FREE
742 2018-09-17 22:20:40 I met an oncology doctor the other day, who actually prescribes CBD Oil, etc.  She is very concerned and is worried about the police force.  She isn't the first doctor I have heard say this either.  I sure hope they have done their homework.
743 2018-09-17 22:20:39 oil coats the boy from head to toe, but for good reason. the vintage harleys donated to him are almost tinkered to perfection; all they need is some finer tuning and a good shining up.

745 2018-09-17 22:20:33 Oil will need to come out in the first game of year with a pissed off attitude. Which I believe they will. Lucic will have a bone to pick and leave a statement that this will be a different team.

759 2018-09-17 22:19:25 I don't think people are talking about regular investments when using the word neo-colonialism but rather the building of infrastructure for cheap/free to get goodwill/influence. Oil in Nigeria is a mess and at this point the government is just seeking the limit of citizens there
760 2018-09-17 22:19:20 Do we have savy people in government with a sole job of monitoring global trends e.g Tech, Oil&Gas etc.?

We need such, so policies can be formed to catch up on these advancements.
761 2018-09-17 22:19:19 Just one more tempest in a teapot. The oil lobby has spends MILLIONS advocating for big oil. What are the critics afraid of???

770 2018-09-17 22:17:56 That is why @realDonaldTrump has given consideration to "regime change" in Venezuela.  It is for the oil.  Other people's property.  Wanting what others have = war.
771 2018-09-17 22:17:54 When was the last time you checked your oil levels? Do this weekly, more so if you travel long distances. Never let your car run dry.

782 2018-09-17 22:16:57 Instead of pipelines of oil and gas why not ones for water that other wise gets washed down drains. Water tanks buried underground on roadways that thru high risks fire areas that can be set of before firefighters arrive. Utilising unused farm lands as wind farms solar farms.
783 2018-09-17 22:16:54 do they have to approve it the first week or the first month?
784 2018-09-17 22:16:44 Ok I know I’m gonna sound crazy but I NEVER used CBD oil and I got this horrible sore throat and was so swollen for days and I rubbed cbd oil all over my neck, throat and lymph nodes and the next day I was completely fine no swelling or soreness it was so weird.

806 2018-09-17 22:13:24 You should talk about the 8K people laid off due to gov't incompetence and the effect on their families. About the thousands of Albertans still unemployed in the oil patch and their families. Then justify jetting all over the world trying to ensure their situation won't change.

845 2018-09-17 22:09:56 you should use coconut oil, it’s so great for making your hair feel rejuvenated! but it leaves a bit of a residue so i suggest using coconut oil first then a color safe shampoo and conditioner after.

863 2018-09-17 22:06:58 Totally agree!  These Social Networks hold users hostage. They have a Monopoly and need to be broken up, just like Ma Bell was broken up, just like Standard Oil. They should not be able to restrict Free Speech.
864 2018-09-17 22:06:55 Which essential oil (if you don't mind)? Some are MUCH stronger than others.  so sorry for your poor skin!!!

866 2018-09-17 22:06:27 I agree we need help from the feds , raising the taxes on the big oil companies is a little trickier. How about the millions in savings that can be had within government departments ? #nlpoli
867 2018-09-17 22:06:22 The squeaky wheel got the oil it seems!
868 2018-09-17 22:05:36 When they’re making the chicken they put it in milk tbh can’t have any takeaway bcos of the oil

877 2018-09-17 22:03:08 Why? You know nothing about 2 times elected president Maduro and Venezuela (where  the US tried to overthrow the government with violent coups plots, 24/7 propaganda and is greatest oil reserve in the world) but US propaganda is the way to go
878 2018-09-17 22:03:07 Slopped sesame oil on the table while trying to stir an uncooperative tin of tahini. Now my arms are moisturized and the top of my cat’s head smells delicious.
879 2018-09-17 22:03:03 Who is drilling in the Golan Heights? Murdoch and his Genie Oil Company.
It gets worse and worse if you think about it all, plus there is a pipe line under Syria that the US want to get hold of.
880 2018-09-17 22:03:03 And supafry...best oil (and healthiest) for deep frying ..no nasty seed oils

890 2018-09-17 22:01:37 Hormonal acne is a big problem for teens and women between the ages of 20 and 29. When you’re suffering from a hormonal imbalance, it can overstimulate oil glands, which can clog pores.

891 2018-09-17 22:01:28 A vacuous comment from a professional politician who can only think and act along party lines. I see plenty of CVs from oil workers needing jobs, what has she ever done to help her constituents affected by the downturn in oil and gas?
892 2018-09-17 22:01:27 If you see me full of oil or masa, mind your business hoe, I just got out work
893 2018-09-17 22:01:17 Oil gamma still cheap…
894 2018-09-17 22:01:14 Not sure will check because oil companies/drillers could be involved. Did you see the movie WIND RIVER?
895 2018-09-17 22:01:04 And... Dad worked in the oil business. I spent my summers with him and would often go into the field with him. He would have me climb the ladder on the side of the oil tank to the top and pull the hatch to check the level in the tank- I was about 7/8! That was actually crazy!

897 2018-09-17 22:00:47 The real reason art students only buy clothes from goodwill is bc when they eventually get ruined u can just say “whatever, it was a $4 goodwill sweater” and pretend u didn’t actually really like that sweater that u got red oil paint on and can never wear again
898 2018-09-17 22:00:42 Um NEVER FUCKING PUT ESSENTIAL OIL IN YOUR BATH. My skin is on fucking fire. My skin is sensitive though so maybe it’s just me. I immediately tried to wash it off with a shower but it still burned.

905 2018-09-17 22:00:01 But I will put some valid arguments Elevating the fuel prices without any justification when the crude oil price is comparatively low. Price of fuel maintained high by imposing high tax rate is a classic example of burdening the general public.
906 2018-09-17 21:59:52 Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:
James 5:14
907 2018-09-17 21:59:33 I ran out of tea tree oil. This is pure heartbreak 
908 2018-09-17 21:59:32 Wait.
909 2018-09-17 21:59:26 Got7
910 2018-09-17 21:59:20 But so far I’m still dry af unless I actually have coconut oil on
911 2018-09-17 21:59:10 Panels not pipelines does not suggest eliminating oil. Things can work together, look into it.
912 2018-09-17 21:58:57 Came home to find a new faucet in my bathroom, vegetable oil on the table, and seven yellowjackets crawling casually on my windows. What does it mean? And: can my car sleep 1 human and 1 cat comfortably tonight?
913 2018-09-17 21:58:53 I can’t wait till they try tomatoes with olive oil sandwiches. #mindblowing #itsacubanthing #wegrewupinacubanhousehold #werenotyellingwerecubans
914 2018-09-17 21:58:51 lol good to hear. I have an outdoor cat like that....If there is ever a nuclear war, there will be three things left...Keith Richards, cockroaches and my cat
915 2018-09-17 21:58:46 You two back slapping each other is bs.
We’re importing oil from Saudi and having it refined in Irving plants...seems ridiculous financially and environmentally.
Shipping coal is ok?
Not everybody gets to live off the taxpayers....
916 2018-09-17 21:58:23 Had a yeast infection AND BV during pregnancy & I had no idea bc I was using coconut oil to mitigate any itch/didn’t have any smell was ON TOP of my pussy cleansing ritual
917 2018-09-17 21:58:20 Coconut oil helps, apparently
918 2018-09-17 21:58:18 夜って空が明るいんだね！
919 2018-09-17 21:58:18 Well I had today off for PTC this week so I got my oil changed on my car, long overdue. Also, I went to the doctor and for a new anxiety/antidepressant that shouldn’t interact with my other meds.
920 2018-09-17 21:58:05 this oil cart is called pink panties I love it ahah 
921 2018-09-17 21:57:41 Why it happens ? I noticed that myself too. Huge volume today in gold and oil. Usuallt gold rises in times of high inflation. We ll see...
922 2018-09-17 21:57:38 I really think about this our country, they claim they’ve discovered oil, I really wonder what kind of oil that is, maybe olive oil or coconut oil, because looking at a county like Qatar the way dem de bang the oil money!!! Herh! Fuel prices just shoot up anyhow in this ghana
923 2018-09-17 21:57:34 Curious, since If oil falls or stocks fall, US hand in trade wars weakens
924 2018-09-17 21:57:32 LMAO! Some motivational speaking kinda rhyme
925 2018-09-17 21:57:12 Pls open up and tell Nigerians what you know about 1914 amalgamation, The Oil and Water refused to mix over 100 years of that terrible experiment

928 2018-09-17 21:56:45 Scott, I had many engine issues and had to replace the transfer case.  Also found the engine was losing oil.
929 2018-09-17 21:56:27 To whoever stained the walmart parking lot with oil in the shape of a dick and balls cumming--I see you. Your work does not go under appreciated
930 2018-09-17 21:56:22 .........a esta la veo en la tienda donde compro el carrito el Echenique y pidiendole consejo,de si gas oil,gasolina,gas o hibrido....
931 2018-09-17 21:56:21 Rose water & CBD oil for the PMS
932 2018-09-17 21:56:07 Melissa, care to share where "Beto says he wants to ban guns in Texas"? Also, PETA has nothing to do with the @BetoORourke campaign. Also, Ted Cruz is a spineless snake oil salesman who only looks out for himself. You're too poor for him to care about, rest assured.
933 2018-09-17 21:56:01 you remember my shitpost about giving myself the "I'm the coward?" rant when I dont want to do something?? just did the cold shower and conditioned my hair and jesus fuck I forgot my conditioner had peppermint oil in it.
934 2018-09-17 21:55:51 Petrol-diesel se kya lena dena.... Bs gadi chalana hai  
Crude oil/ petroleum all this stupid
935 2018-09-17 21:55:28 Frustrating day. Gonna burn the midnight oil via script writing.
936 2018-09-17 21:55:28 Not all PURE CBD oil are created the same!!

No fillers or additives with CTFO!!
937 2018-09-17 21:55:24 @DanieBuzz I had stomach problems when my baby was 3 weeks old,years ago. It took Drs 9 months 2 diagnose me with I.B.S which is caused by stress as the colon spasms. Mayb u have Irritable Bowel Syndrome? Medication is available but peppermint tea & peppermint oil capsules r gr8!
938 2018-09-17 21:55:17 Maybe when I was 17! Lmao. It's a small oil/gas digital consultancy firm. Gunslingers trying to win clients and also protect their IP

940 2018-09-17 21:55:10 Not religion it's imperialism & power /control over resources esp oil!
941 2018-09-17 21:55:09 Normal people : Mobil Oil

Faisalabadi : Moblail
942 2018-09-17 21:55:01 Definitely fake. The proposed "fake" oil minister is unknown in politics but comes from the oil sector, was director of gas filling company and oil pipeline co.
943 2018-09-17 21:54:55 Coca-cola is thinking about adding CBD oil to its product  yeahhh but what percentage? That shit is going to be so low. Don’t add something helpful to something harmful. It’s a gimmick 
944 2018-09-17 21:54:55 If you can read it's the shortfall between the snps oil revenue forecast in the white paper and what the actual result was. A 30 billion shortfall which if Indy had happened we would all be covering in massive tax rises and austerity. Hardly for the people.
945 2018-09-17 21:54:30 Burning the midnight oil as well?
946 2018-09-17 21:54:21 Mostly cocoa butter, castor oil, vitamin e oil, olive oil, coconut oil. Jojoba too
947 2018-09-17 21:54:02 Voice of reason, Russia and Syria have an agreement since 70s. What west was doing is just arming terrorists and buying oil from them.
948 2018-09-17 21:54:00 "clash of European/Western and Eurasian civilization on the one hand, and with Islamic civilization on the other"
And this, because of oil and hegemony.
We'll face WWIII because of hegemony and oil.
Human values are lost.
And I totally disagree with this, so I take some distance.
949 2018-09-17 21:53:58 Is it the same quality of oil ?
950 2018-09-17 21:53:56 Also with acrylic it’s good to start light and then add dark but with oil it’s better to start dark and then blend the light on after because it’s a lot harder to go darker once you add the light
951 2018-09-17 21:53:42 America is one of the richest and most powerful nations in the world. We take resources from other countries (oil from one ... gold from another). With that power and richness comes responsibility. We can improve our own country and help others internationally as well.
952 2018-09-17 21:53:40 #NatGas > Oil > Carbon
953 2018-09-17 21:53:27 i dont think you can really count on ppl to hold you upbc if you ever try using them as a foundation your house will crush them into oil
954 2018-09-17 21:53:19 then @PressSec you're as insane as Donald is ... if Donald is anything it is the ANTI-Christ....the one spoken of in the Bible who would come and basically be the snake oil salesman that Donald is, leading you all astray....he is EVIL !
955 2018-09-17 21:53:15 Yeh bitch w some olive oil and lemon pepper it’s the shit
956 2018-09-17 21:52:56 Again, she nailed it! I by LP Cannabis and it's killing my lungs. It's not flushed good, burns black and crappy. I like Good, Clean Cannabis only grown by Connessoir's who know what each strain can do. You don't want little kids taking Oil with pesticides. This is War! #cndpoli
957 2018-09-17 21:52:27 Agreed. Nuclear plants & oil don't mix.
958 2018-09-17 21:52:25 Ooh, I get it, oil's on me.
959 2018-09-17 21:52:23 You wouldn’t believe how often this happens at the shop. Old techs just want oil changes and services.
960 2018-09-17 21:52:18 Chris, listen to me. I need you to rescue two hostages from an underwater oil field. Agent Sherry Birkin... ...and Jake Muller. He's Albert Wesker's son.

964 2018-09-17 21:51:44 "B.C. is also helping to prop up Alberta’s oil industry by shipping it lots of extremely valuable “gas liquids” — byproducts of natural gas which are essential to dilute heavy oil or bitumen so that it can move more readily through pipelines."
965 2018-09-17 21:51:37 I had to wait for my damn oil change, then at the bank , NOW HEB. Over it
966 2018-09-17 21:51:32 We love you Lucas oil swift!

968 2018-09-17 21:50:57 IF I CHOSE GAS SNAKE PEOPLE MIGHT INTERPRET THAT AS A STANCE ON THE OIL LOBBY-
969 2018-09-17 21:50:53 Oh man! :( thats understandable. well I got an oil field on my face. The US is jealous. Why couldn’t we have combo skin 
970 2018-09-17 21:50:39 Do you have a picture of it? Link?I've been using coffee+castor oil body scrub it makes my skin baby soft I don't even have to moisturize my body after using it lolol.
971 2018-09-17 21:50:20 My dad got my oil changed and filled my car up for me while I was gone this weekend 
972 2018-09-17 21:50:08 Rates doubling in the next 14 years are pure corporate oil/nuclear scare tactics. Without renewable, our rates will surely double in that time frame. Arizona is nothing but sunshine. We should build more solar and start selling our excess energy to others.
973 2018-09-17 21:49:59 This same excitement 6lack's songs gave me was the same August Alsina's gave me a few years back

976 2018-09-17 21:49:45 Nah the transition from way beyond to oil on water is what gets me through tbh
977 2018-09-17 21:49:43 And now I am here, looking for a recipe and try to understand if they must be soft or Crispy. And. If. I can put oil instead of butter. And it's almost midnight... What am I doing it?! 
978 2018-09-17 21:49:42 Boomers still romanticising coal. It was a terrible technology for the environment and did horrible things to the miners. We should rejoice that Thatcher ended the industry in favour of oil and gas.
979 2018-09-17 21:49:38 Our department is slowly trying to encourage heat blocks over oil baths. We use them in our group, and they’re not ideal for every reaction, but so so convenient for reflux

Remember the impossible wealth, John D. Rockefeller, Eastern Standard Oil?
The Supreme Court ordered Eastern Standard Oil broken up
Rockefeller's wealth went from impossible to imponderable
Never to have been duplicated
Then, too, Times were different back then.

994 2018-09-17 21:48:04 @vegsoc Hello. So chips, onion rings etc....fried in same oil meat has been cooked in. Vegetarian or not?
995 2018-09-17 21:48:04 I just checked on their website and even my son who went in 2011 shows needs to pay extra 2000SAR !!!! Rip off merchants Saudi ! Oil price down so they do this!!!

998 2018-09-17 21:47:31 Wow....HBD Morgan, one of the oil barons!
999 2018-09-17 21:47:30 If they could build engines that didn’t need an oil change every 5k miles and cars with a little reliability, things would perhaps be different. I’d like to buy a Jaguar but will not invest in such a risk.
1000 2018-09-17 21:47:23 Chef Kawasaki cut up some Pikmin, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was 1000 rat corpses, along with toast.
1001 2018-09-17 21:47:12 So the oil money flows.

I need to make a new pinned post later so forgive me for not responding any more than that.
1002 2018-09-17 21:47:11 isn’t it weird how low fat coconut milk is a scam but low fat hummus is like a reverse scam? low fat coconut milk means more water and less actual coconut milk and we buy that bc we are conditioned to think it’s better but low fat hummus means u get more chickpeas n less oil !

1005 2018-09-17 21:46:36 Those folks truly believe that we’re all going to fall for the lines that they’re feeding us; that we are dumb enough to buy the “snake oil” that they’re selling. Do not get distracted by the SIDE SHOW.
1006 2018-09-17 21:46:17 I don't relate to either.I believe in balanced budgets, low taxes, am against wars for oil and the war on drugs.I am against government spying on citizens, the NSA and a border wall. I am against government regulation unless nessasary.  Neither the Rs or Ds agree with any of that
1007 2018-09-17 21:46:07 I measure them the same way I measure olive oil ..
1008 2018-09-17 21:46:07 And oil...
1009 2018-09-17 21:45:57 It's just I'm fed up with people thinking that Russia is the perfect ally for Syria and it has Syria's best interests at heart, people seem to be forgetting that Russia has benefited significantly from this as well. Economic deals, oil monopoly, power, geo-politics, bases ect.
1010 2018-09-17 21:45:51 ive started putting beard oil in my eyebrows in the hopes of having eyebrows akin to feather dusters

1012 2018-09-17 21:45:24 Getting my oil changed and my phone automatically connected to my car and started playing @MyFavMurder, the poor mechanic that got my car was probably very thrown off 
1013 2018-09-17 21:45:15 Snake oil salesman peddling false hope to those who believe.
1014 2018-09-17 21:45:14 I’ve finally decided to get an oil change
1015 2018-09-17 21:44:52 missus once had a Beetle 1.8T was the same. no possible way to stop oil draining all over the place
1016 2018-09-17 21:44:44 That black slick in the Earth's crust called oil - needed "chemists", "experts" - the tinkers/manipulators of natural law to refine it to power the machines.
1017 2018-09-17 21:44:38 2:23 PM Sam in BA dry shaving her face - moustache, chin, cheeks, between eyebrows. Cams switch. Cams back to Sam shaving forehead over eyebrows, eyebrows, goes over previously shaved again. Asks Tyler if she can use his olive oil conditioner after her shower. #BB20 #BBLF
1018 2018-09-17 21:44:36 ‘Cologne’ used properly is just the ratio of essential oil to alcohol. Contrast w/ eat de parfum or eau de toilette. But gendering fragrances is definitely a scam.
1019 2018-09-17 21:44:22 A couple of weeks ago I tried to make brownies from a box and I messed them up by adding too much water and using applesauce as a substitute for vegetable oil... this is why I can’t have nice things

1021 2018-09-17 21:43:50 I use bio oil on mine it doesn't smell and between weigh loss and the oil they've faded so much
1022 2018-09-17 21:43:42 @HillaryClinton And are the Global news systems that screamed Russia did it because they do not own Russian oil nor their money this time around and they are afraid people will see how well how much better they are doing owning their own oil and money obviously
1023 2018-09-17 21:43:33 FFS These ships use the dregs of oil refineries that are TOXIC WASTE and should not be used as fuel.  The stockholders and directors of this company should be tied at water line in case they hit any ice.

That doesn't mean voodoo and snake oil - in fact it shouldn't . Wellness didn't appoint anyone - alt-health hijacked it.
1026 2018-09-17 21:42:56 I hope it’s silicon oil.
I’d rather use a heating mantle or an aluminum block. And control with the temp probe in the flask, not in the bath… and have a webcam on it and a remote switch...
or I can tell you about my scars.

1028 2018-09-17 21:42:31 it's to bad the current occupant of WH has less than a minimal knowledge of economics, finance and business in general. he's a charter member of the lucky sperm club who became a snake oil salesman
1029 2018-09-17 21:42:31 I've just invented a really quick way of making an Italian sauce made from basil, Parmesan, pine nuts and olive oil. I'm going to call it 'Hey Pesto!' #BadPun

1031 2018-09-17 21:42:28 Crap. The Brits gave him the Grand Mufti title & with their bias in favour of the Arabs bc of oil, the Arabs had free reign. The Brits only went after him when it was clear he was a German ally.

1035 2018-09-17 21:42:10 My late grandmother used to have her oil changed at a local shop. After she passed I got the car. Those knuckleheads had the drain plug so tight, I had to take it to their garage and told them to get it loose. Why do that?
1036 2018-09-17 21:42:07 The oil industry in this province is very capital-intensive. Not many people in this province employed on the rigs
1037 2018-09-17 21:42:06 You do realize the phone, tablet, or laptop you’re tweeting on is made of oil byproduct.
1038 2018-09-17 21:42:05 What's beard oil for and why is it so expensive??
@dadtoadaughter?

1040 2018-09-17 21:41:59 You do realize that oil is a fungible commodity and that given we will still need liquid fuels for our transportation needs any reduction in supply from here will be met from other sources only they won't be transported as safely #bcpoli #abpoli 5/

1043 2018-09-17 21:41:43 I don't understand how ppl say leave NAFTA, or don't renegotiate. there are 10's of thousands of not 100's of thousands of jobs on the because of this clowns incompetence. 20% of our GDP depends on this. We are 2% of their trade.  USA is now the biggest oil producer in the world
1044 2018-09-17 21:41:43 Shouldn’t you be more concerned with your bottom line... oh right, that’s what you’re doing now. Gotcha  plenty of snake oil still to sell, go get em Alex!
1045 2018-09-17 21:41:43 Client got new windows + now there’s damp seeping through. Window guy says the sills need 2B “scraped clean at the join & then painted with oil-based undercoat & overcoat (3 coats)”.  Sounds fishy...  Not heard of oil based Masonry paint before. Ideas? @decoratorsforum
1046 2018-09-17 21:41:41 It's the easiest thing in the world to do. Just relax totally. No fear. No pushing. The energy will take over for you and pulse the baby out. Make sure you eat lots of progesterone foods in the last month like evening primrose oil & maca, & powdered plant proteins like lucuma.
1047 2018-09-17 21:41:26 i washed all mikey’s clothes and folded them and took his truck to get an oil change while he was at work. so when are we getting married?
1048 2018-09-17 21:41:25 How do they truly know it's marijuana and not just CBD oil which is legal in all 50 states. CBD does not have THC or if it does at a very low % that it does not have the hallucinate side affects. Because you are not being specific this post could be misleading.
1049 2018-09-17 21:41:24 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.

1052 2018-09-17 21:41:10 Agreed. Lancôme, Estée Lauder, and weirdly enough, the Mary Kay one. You gotta get the oil/water mix that you have to shake up before using.
1053 2018-09-17 21:41:08 Brazilian Palm Oil doesn’t cause deforestation - many reports have actually  stated it could help protect the Amazon. It’s not the oil that’s bad - it’s how it’s produced

1059 2018-09-17 21:40:28 In honor of my dads birthday I scheduled my car to get an oil change
1060 2018-09-17 21:40:27 So let's go back to my initial question. How has anything you have done helped to achieve the goals you so loudly proclaim? Even if we entirely shut down the oil sands will that make a dent on Canadian demand? Will it in any way reduce global emissions? #bcpoli #abpoli 4/
1061 2018-09-17 21:40:22 Murph, my hefty oil collection is mostly doTERRA, but young Living Oils make up about 30% of my collection, and have some of my favorites. However doTERRA wins with Deep Blue. I can't live without it.
1062 2018-09-17 21:40:22 Yes, I will most definitely admit it, it's called propaganda, it's how the US and the UK justify bombing the shit out of their countries for oil. Did you not notice Iran appears to be next with trumps rhetoric

1067 2018-09-17 21:39:56 Boy I can’t wait to get paid this week. I’m trying to see what one of these 70hr+ oil field paychecks is looking like.
1068 2018-09-17 21:39:46 I recently started using CBD oil (put under the tongue) to help with depression, anxiety and sleep. My mind definitely started feeling lighter after using it.
1069 2018-09-17 21:39:36 Took my vehicle to @Honda for a routine oil change and they tried to convince me I need $800 in repairs, then took 3 hours for a procedure that should take one at most. They just returned my key to me (worked fine when I arrived) and it is malfunctioning. Extremely disappointed.
1070 2018-09-17 21:39:30 There used to be excise duty in the oil price but that was abolished. The road funds levy is currently 40p. The energy debt recovery levy is currently 41p. The energy funds levy is about 1p per litre. - Shiela Abiemo (Head of Research, NPA) #PointofView
1071 2018-09-17 21:39:03 So says #JerryBrown, who's family became RICH from oil due to his dad helping the Indonesia's military dictator #Suarto and #Pertamina. LYING Jerry Brown.
1072 2018-09-17 21:39:02 My teenage years making Sicilian pizzas for Noble Romans taught me this. You have to use what seems like a inordinate amount of olive oil.
1073 2018-09-17 21:38:49 Pictsweet Farms Vegetables for Roasting tonight for dinner. Chose the brussel sprouts and butternut squash variety. Easy and tastey side to go with barbeque ribs. A little bit of oil and twenty minutes in the oven, delicious. #GotItFree #PictsweetFarms #LetsRoast #RoastEmUp
1074 2018-09-17 21:38:44 Shetland and Orkney voted no ,more than any part of Scotland , wonder who'd keep the oil?

1078 2018-09-17 21:37:58 Just another morning of oil burns on my belly 

Who wants banana chips 
1079 2018-09-17 21:37:58 You don't need them to be positive. Media is corrupt anyways, controlled by oil and other corporations that will not profit from electric cars and clean technology.
1080 2018-09-17 21:37:57 oil don pour, I get dodo here, anyone thinking what I’m thinking ???
1081 2018-09-17 21:37:43 My last day at church was when the pastor asked me to “act like a demon just entered your body” I refused so three men held me against my will and poured oil on me, I was fuming, as soon as I managed to escape I told my step mom about it, nothing was done or said.
1082 2018-09-17 21:37:43 Castor oil thank me later
1083 2018-09-17 21:37:38 Ugh, apparently it’s September/October these fuggers come out.
If anyone has good ideas on how to kill these house spiders quickly I’m all ears. I’ve already bought a humidifier which I top up with peppermint oil but clearly that didn’t work.
1084 2018-09-17 21:37:38 what happened? it smelled like oil but smoke looked like it was coming from the gearbox
1085 2018-09-17 21:37:24 Going into the oil field I’ve found a new appreciation for school. Although the money is awesome, it’s just not always about the money. I would much rather be at a desk, sitting through a lecture, and studying for a test. So don’t take things for granted
1086 2018-09-17 21:37:21 I just use Moroccan Oil after showering and that’s about it veere.
1087 2018-09-17 21:37:17 6-4 Oil!
1088 2018-09-17 21:37:15 I zoomed in on this trying to find out what lipstick she was holding but it was an oil pastel 
1089 2018-09-17 21:36:52 Weddings are Satanic rituals to uphold the patriarchy! The electric car was killed by Walt Disney! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
1090 2018-09-17 21:36:37 The recipe calls for 2 T. olive oil in the pan, and I (stupidly) thought that was WAY too much so I took some out. Don't be me.
1091 2018-09-17 21:36:33 please enjoy a paleo flan with tequila, olive oil, and almond.
1092 2018-09-17 21:36:25 about to eat fish oil & hair supplements for breakfast, lunch, & dinner 
1093 2018-09-17 21:36:24 Maybe you need to do some research. Oil and bitumen are *not* synonymous!!!
1094 2018-09-17 21:36:10 Oatly (oat milk) is nice, but I’m not coo with the canola oil in it
1095 2018-09-17 21:35:48 THE GOOD NEWS IS MY CAR JUST MAY NEED DIFFERENT OIL THE BAD NEWS IS IF IT KEEPS MAKING A TICKING SOUND IT WILL COST $1200 AND MY BROTHER JUST AGREED TO GO AHEAD AND HAVE THE EXHAUST CHANGED FOR $600 I MAKE $9 AN HOUR AND HAVE TO PAY 4 SCHOOL HELP
1096 2018-09-17 21:35:32 That’s not the same. These guys have beef. It’s like mixing oil and water. They cannot coexist as sponsors because most of both companies messages consist of “my product is better than my competitor’s in every way”
1097 2018-09-17 21:35:26 Who needs clean air.i say Big coal,big oil,fracking and anything else that me a lil more prosperous is for me ..MAGA

1108 2018-09-17 21:34:42 Your beliefs that everyone is lying but those you believe in is typically human. To observe patterns around you is a sign of intelligence. Yet you don’t see the patterns by hateful hearts who have only the desire to toss burning oil on your opponent when you can’t win with ideas.
1109 2018-09-17 21:34:36 The whole of Nigeria is retrogressive that's why u have Delta and cross river communities still killing each other over land boundaries. Militants blowing up oil pipelines with impunity.    Chill, we r all terrible and no region is superior in relative term.

1115 2018-09-17 21:33:43 So I guess without the electoral college, the food and oil producing states will have to withhold their resources sent to the condo dwelling liberals in order to leverage their representation.

1117 2018-09-17 21:32:56 There is literally a hospital here holding a GoFundMe to stay open, and the city with the lowest life expectancy is in this state. Meanwhile, we give oil and gas companies tax breaks to keep their business here while we ignore the most vulnerable members of the state.

1133 2018-09-17 21:30:27 Plus picking the "right battles" always seem to be politically motivated and not ethically motivated. That is why so many people were willing to listen to a snake oil salesman announcing he would drain the swamps.  

There is no question that the Republicans have lost their way.

1136 2018-09-17 21:30:21 Norway should be #1.. Tiny little country..barely 5 million people. Over 1.5 Million Barrels of oil per day & over 110 Billion CM of gas production.  With the reserves.. basically you are born a millionaire in Norway.
1137 2018-09-17 21:30:17 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。
1138 2018-09-17 21:30:11 It seems like everything always wants to go wrong with your car at once. Need brakes, then new wipers, then an oil change. Like damn
1139 2018-09-17 21:30:07 Give over. I studied for enough years to know. Go to college medical school and university then come back to me. Also have people in your family go through cancer and have CBD oil and then also come back to me taraa
1140 2018-09-17 21:30:03 Avocado oil is a healthy alternative to vegetable oils. Avocado oil is rich in monounsaturated fats like olive oil, but it is stable at h...
1141 2018-09-17 21:30:01 NOVA is blue, everywhere else is red (except Charlottesville and Richmond proper).

Some leftist wrote a book about splitting the nation into 4 different ones. He wanted to keep Texas bc of oil. I thought the leftists were greenies!
1142 2018-09-17 21:29:43 I remember Jim advising to go all in and buy oil at $80 (after $120) and then oil went to 30 imidiately!
1143 2018-09-17 21:29:35 Perhaps you don't think you said that but that is exactly what you said.

The crisis manifested in a crush of asset and commodity prices (shares, oil, property etc) and the cause had absolutely nothing to do with taxes. Nothing!!!
1144 2018-09-17 21:29:35 Says Ben Ninno of the Atlantic, Council, fumed by USmGovt, NATO, Gulf State Dictators, Big Oil Companies & the Military Industrial Complex.
1145 2018-09-17 21:29:34 @BlairKing_ca is the master of circular reasoning. We need liquid fuels to run aspects of our society (eg. plane flight) but do not require new infrastructure as we have reserves of conventional crude oil internationally to meet needs during a transition to a #lowcarbon economy.
1146 2018-09-17 21:29:28 He selling Kroger olive oil with 11 herbs and spices, promising long hair results for $300.
1147 2018-09-17 21:29:06 It isn't fine if you're selling the prospect of indy on the basis of a lie (oil is a bonus!). Had we voted 'Yes' we'd be at least £30bn worse off—and that's just the oil revenue aspect; there would have been far more losses to contend with but Yes/SNP covered them all up.
1148 2018-09-17 21:29:02 No i didn't his family owned big steel and oil business worth billions. Sure the Bush family were in business with them years ago. He doesn't even look pakistani.
1149 2018-09-17 21:28:19 all u rlly need to do is put some concealer or foundation on ur lips and then put some blush all over ur face & back of ur neck. put some olive oil or coconut oil on ur hair bc rednecks always look greasy & gross & BOOM ull fit right in. also just be constantly clenching ur jaw
1150 2018-09-17 21:28:12 US independence means not needing OPEC oil or Chinese steel funneled thru a multitude of countries to supply our armed forces should it ever come to that.
1151 2018-09-17 21:28:11 We could use them here too.  But dream it’s is while oil companies and mining companies run the country more than politicians do.
1152 2018-09-17 21:28:09 Don Young only believes in socialism for oil companies.

The rest of us; piss off. 

Also, Obamacare is a disaster. 

#medicareforall is the answer.
1153 2018-09-17 21:28:06 It's risible. Mrs May blows her hot #brexitshambles breathe over Malta PM, to win him over. Westminster are cosying up to EU Malta. Honestly. Scots voted Remain; yet Malta gets a say. And #indyref Scots told can't survive despite oil/fishing/energy & much more Malta doesn't have.
1154 2018-09-17 21:27:45 Does Chinese drink oil or what?
1155 2018-09-17 21:27:44 I got my rosemary oil from Earthfare
1156 2018-09-17 21:27:38 No more experimenting with hair products for me ... sticking to my Olive oil line of products and good old coconut oil ....
1157 2018-09-17 21:27:32 This is not a tribal thing, but I can bring myself to trust Calabar men
1158 2018-09-17 21:27:21 Its a complex problem that will require a complex solution but as I've said we need the fed's help & we need to raise taxes on the Big Oil/Mining corps who are making billions off our resources & giving us pennies for them
1159 2018-09-17 21:27:19 @HillaryClinton But as the nastiness that is coming out uses nasty American slang i am inclined to believe phones at the DNC computers etc. had backdoors built into them by probably caucasian Americans who stand to profit by Russia being blocked from selling oil into the markets
1160 2018-09-17 21:27:17 Ikr. All US actually wants is natural goods. As per the Islamic prophecy, Euphrates is to dry up & reveal mountain of gold when the end times are near. Many say it will be in the form of natural oil. The river flows from Iraq and Syria. Coincidence?
1161 2018-09-17 21:26:55 But hey sometimes ppl like hate. So they keep it going. They spread hate like fire on oil.
1162 2018-09-17 21:26:49 Currently got coconut oil all over me face in the hope it’s gonna work some miracles and transform me from a 2 to a 10
1163 2018-09-17 21:26:47 So my 5yr old daughter came home from school today & explained all about palm oil & the damage that has been done to the wildlife & nature to produce it. She is so passionate about the planet & the damage we as humans are causing, thank you #wicorprimary #minihorts #markwildman
1164 2018-09-17 21:26:43 I hate it when I get behind a car that is burning oil or burning antifreeze and I immediately Wonder oh my God my car is going to break down.
1165 2018-09-17 21:26:33 It’s not jacking up the vape pens. Oil has to be wrong term.
1166 2018-09-17 21:26:31 If the @ChicagoBears lose to the Seahawks tonight I will drink motor oil for a year. Ok bye #MNF #BEARSTALK #Beardown #bears @52Mack_
1167 2018-09-17 21:26:28 It wasn't the transfer payments that put Alberta where they are. It was the past provincial governments giving away their resources for pennies on the dollar, all in the name of creating jobs. Why? Because big oil threatened them that they wouldn't come otherwise.
1168 2018-09-17 21:26:22 ماانا سالت الدولاب اروح للدكتورةقاللى لا ده بيحرض الناس علينا
1169 2018-09-17 21:25:47 Okay, I only have used Bactine and tee tree oil but I get wym like when I wash my face damn ittttt
1170 2018-09-17 21:25:44 There is no good deal to have. Never was. You’ve bought the snake oil and at some point you will realise it won’t do what he peddler men told you.
1171 2018-09-17 21:25:42 I hardly ever j*** o** with lube. But when I do I use baby oil gel 
1172 2018-09-17 21:25:40 Yes. There are costs in terms of both time & money for the consumer. What's more, I am not a customer of Equifax. I didn't choose to engage with them. They have my family's data and they spilled it all over the internet. Costs to clean up? On me. Unlike BP or Exxon w/ oil spill
1173 2018-09-17 21:25:39 Yeah! Quit marinating in motor oil, Christine!!!
1174 2018-09-17 21:25:39 You can but you get a better consistency without it, I put 3 drops of Rosemary oil in mine to get rid of that oatmeal smell.
1175 2018-09-17 21:25:33 Products are potash oil and grains.
1176 2018-09-17 21:25:23 People that said Monday.. You have oil on your head. Those of you who think otherwise please explain. 
1177 2018-09-17 21:25:22 @cbdadvocate Hi. Really like your screen name. I just discovered cbd oil for my spinal stenosis. It's like lidocaine 5mg except a cut above. Way better than a narcotic like percocet. Having 2nd fusion soon, but will continue using. Pleased to meet you!
1178 2018-09-17 21:25:15 Ghana will always be a price taker when it comes to crude oil. We can't deal with petroleum prices but what we can deal with is the impact it will have on the people - Senyo Hosi (CEO of CBOD Ghana) #PointofView
1179 2018-09-17 21:25:00 @Jakewim 
Jimbo cashed in the dumpster fire in Tallahassee for the oil money at A&M...smartest man in the room...any room.
1180 2018-09-17 21:24:48 Idiot oil was 125 Dollars a barrel when UPA sold petrol for ₹74 per litre. Now oil is $90 a barrel. Say what?
1181 2018-09-17 21:24:45 The NWO... Don't know too much about that. I would recommend you to Google the Barcelona declaration. When Islamic nations extorted the West with oil in the 60s. We made a contract with the devil to get oil for a fair price.
1182 2018-09-17 21:24:38 Show me the video about how you're working hard to clean up tailings ponds and old oil wells.
1183 2018-09-17 21:24:37 If I can no longer read the date I was supposed to get an oil change bc it’s so faded. Do I now need an oil change?
1184 2018-09-17 21:24:33 CBD oil
1185 2018-09-17 21:24:30 Coconut oil
1186 2018-09-17 21:24:12 Hahahaha

Really?

Actually you’ll regret the teeet, idiot, as it just revealed your ignorance 

Hemp is a cousin of cannabis and oil is extracted to make all sorts of products both medical and recreational
1187 2018-09-17 21:24:09 Took my car to the dealership this morning for an oil change and alignment......
1188 2018-09-17 21:24:08 If u pour oil inside yeti e go pop open
1189 2018-09-17 21:23:57 Changing a tire and oil shouldn't take 3 hours and over 200 doll hairs but Wtf do I know
1190 2018-09-17 21:23:46 What about me ?
1191 2018-09-17 21:23:42 Yup.
And the oil doesn't smell like marijuana.
So many of them vape it in public with anonymity.
Still think you're going to hold back the legalization process?
Good luck.

1193 2018-09-17 21:23:25 All the crap in the newspapers, at the end of the weekend, 2 teams have won and 2 teams will have lost. I am excited about Friday but, the big dance is still a week away. 
PS Dusty seen at Woolworths buying olive oil, must be making a Salad , slippery little customer!! 
1194 2018-09-17 21:23:15 He's been pushing this stuff called Beard Lube. He applies beard oil to you as you wait for your oil change.
1195 2018-09-17 21:23:10 This bitch only getting oil and gas out of me moving forward
1196 2018-09-17 21:22:49 I think last time this happened was when we were vetoing the entrance of Venezuela to Mercosur, while enjoying their low oil prices and their patience with Petropar's bullshit.
That didn't end very well.
1197 2018-09-17 21:22:43 I remember a class I had in European colonialism back in grad school; my prof started going off on GWB & oil; it was completely off topic and was more a rant than anything. A student actually asked him if we could get back to the discussion at hand.
1198 2018-09-17 21:22:38 I don't know what pleasure cat find in vegetable oil, if we fry something and left the vegetable oil uncovered overnight or even it's unused oil, my cats(two) will finish the oil before morning... Smh
1199 2018-09-17 21:22:38 oh uh, furries begging me either spotting or uses oil as The great
1200 2018-09-17 21:22:37 I making some. Do you put castor oil in it?
1201 2018-09-17 21:22:34 ...How? That oil is going to fry your coils in a few puffs.
1202 2018-09-17 21:22:13 Who has time for crackling oil or bruising basil if there’s no cocktail? Not me!
1203 2018-09-17 21:22:09 Use coconut oil or shea butter!
1204 2018-09-17 21:22:09 Iran is one of the major suppliers of oil in the world; there is no major change in demand around the world. When OPEC decides to take a stance on any sanctions against Iran, it can affect the world prices - Senyo Hosi (CEO of CBOD Ghana) #PointofView
1205 2018-09-17 21:21:42 Coconut oil really be that bitch huh
1206 2018-09-17 21:21:30 Can you imagine all the African Natural resources shared and tradesd in African terms,  Oil, gold, diamonds, platinum, wild life, besides you can continue failing and afrikaans nobody is stopping you. #EFF_SUPERIOR_LOGIC in Cruise Control
1207 2018-09-17 21:21:29 Always with the violent language. What are moonbats smoking in their hookahs these days? Do they conjure essential oil hate drops and mix with their ganja ....
1208 2018-09-17 21:21:23 Erica just asked if you wash a baby with... baby oil. Yes, baby oil. I don’t even know what to say.

1210 2018-09-17 21:20:58 Could someone do a segment on what the oil patch companies ( Syncrude , Suncore , )
are going to do with legalize weed ? Are they still going to demand screening before hiring ?

1211 2018-09-17 21:20:30 Pictures of blowouts, talk about oil production and Bitcoin. I support this thread.
1212 2018-09-17 21:20:28 Gabon is Africa's sixth largest crude oil producer.
1213 2018-09-17 21:20:22 Oh yeah it’s that natty soreness but yeah I did a castor oil cleanse Friday so imma do a week off supps then switch up my supps to a new stack finna do a dairy free protein

and they added a skate park too for all the people who know that "cool" is on the inside, not in your cars, not in your chicks, not in your duds
1216 2018-09-17 21:19:48 I need an oil change asap
1217 2018-09-17 21:19:44 Yes, I've said this for years. Nine in 10 Americans have some sense that sugar is harmful. Not even one in 10 realizes seed oils are vastly worse, or that "vegetable oil" is toxic, unstable, inflammatory soybean oil. We are "woke" about so much, but why don't people know this?
1218 2018-09-17 21:19:44 I just started using oil paint for a class and my biggest mistakes are definitely using way too much paint and too hard of brush strokes. Or using too much solvent and then thinning out the paint. It is defs not easy
1219 2018-09-17 21:19:37 castor oil! mine did the same until I started massaging my scalp w oil
1220 2018-09-17 21:19:16 Isn't the Joe Biden involved with the Ukranian oil & gas company? Isn't one of them a VP?
1221 2018-09-17 21:19:13 That girl owes me a calf massage. My legs need attention and massage oil.
1222 2018-09-17 21:19:05 The oil contracts are with the corporation - Big Oil doesn't deal with you about African resources it deals with the corporate structure. Big Oil pays $5 barrel x 300,000 barrels a day - held in EU accounts manage by Big Oil accountants. 
The people have, no say in how it works
1223 2018-09-17 21:19:03 The Edinburgh Tram all over again, many times the size
Is anyone surprised?
Consultants will say anything they need to in order to get you to buy their snake oil, pocket their massive fees and then leave.

1225 2018-09-17 21:18:59 Season the squash, my man and maybe drizzle some olive oil too.
1226 2018-09-17 21:18:54 Western media just does not give a fuck about the east does it unless we can bomb it and get oil from it?!
1227 2018-09-17 21:18:46 Honestly it’s a terrible idea to let me wonder Walmart for 45 minutes while I get my oil changed. Like you know im gonna spend money I don’t have, on things I don’t need, but hey, gotta fill that time somehow
1228 2018-09-17 21:18:44 Haha a little goes a long way. Go to Sephora and see if they have a tester see how it works before you commit. I use a rose oil but i googled and I learned they animal test

1245 2018-09-17 21:15:59 I usually eat for breakfast dates with olive oil
1246 2018-09-17 21:15:57 Never liked that. Always thought about all the Vaseline, deep heat and massage oil on players hands. Never wanted that on my palms.
1247 2018-09-17 21:15:57 Aye that black seed oil is legit!!
1248 2018-09-17 21:15:52 My skin is so confused shame, it is screaming for moisture. I can literally feel the ashes  I need a skin oil.

at some stores you can find cuticle oil, cuticle cream, or strengthening clear nail polishes that contain minerals that strengthen your nails.
1252 2018-09-17 21:15:31 Like the Hillary DEPLORABLE comment if you cheered Trump when he mocked disabled, said military should execute entire families, take all the oil in iraq, said POWS are losers, and men women of FBI are Nazis then you are dregs and DEPLORABLE. If you hated these acts, I apologize

1260 2018-09-17 21:13:27 My fans lube lasted about 2 and a half weeks. I'm actually impressed. time to give it that good ol' love oil again.

1263 2018-09-17 21:13:18 Forte Oil. that's who they're fielding
1264 2018-09-17 21:13:18 went to get my oil changed and told the guy “cool beans” when he said everything looked good on my car 
1265 2018-09-17 21:13:16 By far the largest source of revenue Ven has is the sale of oil, to Citgo itself and others, and that has not been affected  by sanctions as per the articles (largely because doing so would create unpleasantness on the US side as well)
1266 2018-09-17 21:13:13 i’m not even ashamed to say my head has been hurting so i laid down put some lavender essential oil on my temples and gave my self a lil massage.... my head feels better so ya that’s cool. gotta love natural remedies, you don’t always need the pills
1267 2018-09-17 21:13:07 Im curious as to when @Starbucks is gonna offer coconut oil shots in their coffee
1268 2018-09-17 21:13:00 Now Andrew Scheer complains about foreign oil being imported into Eastern Canada. Well, Mr. Scheer, Irving oil made it clear that it would not feel bound to refine oil from an EE pipeline and the other refinery (NL) is basically a merchant refinery. #cdnpoli @PnPCBC

1273 2018-09-17 21:12:33 They do have a point as the oil estimates were crazy.  Rather than all the vitriol against a paper i still quite like perhaps people should just unfollow them.
1274 2018-09-17 21:12:16 The matter is tiring. The  marketers are even online flaunting themselves. How can you be marketing how to wreck a guy financially thriugh vaginal oil or firce him to marry you through slippery whatever.... ridiculous stuffs everywhere and ladies are indulging them
1275 2018-09-17 21:12:10 Mine are that much cause I have to have synthetic oil lol
1276 2018-09-17 21:12:01 FOREIGN OIL WOULD STILL FLOW TO EASTERN MARKETS WITH ENERGY EAST BECAUSE THERE ARE NO REFINERIES THAT CAN HANDLE HEAVY CRUDE. #PnPCBC
1277 2018-09-17 21:12:00 Oil Soaks

you can soak your nails in any type of oil (castor oil, coconut oil, olive oil, argan oil, jojoba oil, tea tree oil) for 5 minutes, then rinse with warm water.
1278 2018-09-17 21:11:38 I noticed a big change last two weeks without oil and only doctors advice. He became completely sick and couch locked I'm sure the oil would kept him a lil longer it was probably to late to stop it but who knows we didn't follow threw and I was min dosage
1279 2018-09-17 21:11:35 Man, I need to make more Capricorn oil... that smelled really good 
1280 2018-09-17 21:11:21 Norway's oil is cheaper to produce than the UK's and they produce twice as much as the UK. Sorry to burst your bubble but the fact is the UK's oil is the most expensive in the world.
1281 2018-09-17 21:11:21 SAME. I have been watching tutorials and speedpaints for a year now and it's fueling my determination to learn.
I know the kind!! They're very cool, some people have got mad skills.
I like watercolours and oil paint the most. They look insanely pretty. OTL
1282 2018-09-17 21:11:15 Oh you mean the constant headaches I have every morning, or the smell of oil / tar that lingers throughout my apartment? I might as well start smoking cigarettes again
1283 2018-09-17 21:11:14 Longtime fan... I own "77" on vinyl. But it bothers me that @DBtodomundo played @coachella this year. Goldenvoice (Coachella's organizer) is an @AEGworldwide subsidiary owned by Philip Anschutz, an oil tycoon's billionaire son who supports virulent right-wing causes & candidates.
1284 2018-09-17 21:11:12 Maybe we just need to start our own country. The United Dregs Of America. Trump can be the first POTUD and founding father. Red states have most of the oil.  We can take foreign aid from USA and let the blue states freeze in the dark when broke.

1296 2018-09-17 21:09:38 I think the softening of Islamic law in Saudi was related to spark the words interest in wanting to invest in his technological project that he wants to create in the desert. The oil dependency will hit Saudi hard in a decade or two because alternative energy.
1297 2018-09-17 21:09:36 Listen to ‘trigger warnings’ to anyone still need oil, doesn’t challenge the fearsome painting was the curtailing free speech.

1302 2018-09-17 21:09:27 Norway’s Oil comes from under the Sea but their Oil isn’t handed over to a neighbouring country to squander...
Oil is at $80 a barrel, with extraction costs of $15-20 production is planned to be around 2.5 Million barrels a day by 2020.
Scotland also produces 80% of worlds Whisky

1308 2018-09-17 21:08:34 What about extra virgin olive oil from Spain? Could probably sort out  a giveaway for that!
1309 2018-09-17 21:08:30 I don’t understand why beauty brands put so many terms on foundation and mascara .. like just say Volume Mascara.. don’t need to say Major Volume luscious dark mascara  or Full coverage HD ultra matte finish oil free smooth foundation

1319 2018-09-17 21:06:47 In fairness, the whole party has that same exact secret.

Lots of Russian oil money has been laundered through GOP connections this century.

Billions overall, and some of the loose change from all that action has filled a lot of Republican pockets.

1321 2018-09-17 21:06:37 Hey boomers, I'm trying to mow my lawn but the motor is stalling. It has enough gas and the oil is good, so what else could it be? I do routine maintenance every week.
1322 2018-09-17 21:06:30 I've found applying a serum containing vitamin e oil, vitamin C & jojoba oil to the dry patches before applying moisturizer before bed works well. Just vitamin E oil & jojoba oil helps too. Some folks are sensitive to vitamin C.

1413 2018-09-17 20:54:24 Oil change about to take all my money
1414 2018-09-17 20:54:16 I was wondering about whether I could expand on that very piece for this earlier on. I'll have to oil my brain and figure something out.xx
1415 2018-09-17 20:53:38 GDP of 90% oil. Time to diversify
1416 2018-09-17 20:53:28 As I understand it our currency ONLY works because we force others to use it for oil. Giving it an artificial value backed by guns. By simply printing the money for universal healthcare would actually require more war to float those dollars on. Cuts are required.

1437 2018-09-17 20:49:52 Malnutrition/starvation has ruled VZLA for years, especially after 2013. Hard labor jobs are impossible when the workforce is starving.

1565 2018-09-17 20:32:43 Trump: And the birds, folks. We love the birds, don’t we. So sad, with the solar. You see all the birds. People say “Oil is so bad for us” but they don’t say anything about birds.

1582 2018-09-17 20:31:23 Sometimes oral steroids. Deep breathing & mindfulness. Some people swear by medical cannabis or just CBD oil. I’ve also heard of Botox being added to nerve blocks to prolong the therapeutic effects-research was being done at standford u can ask your doctor about that 3/

1584 2018-09-17 20:31:17 I think the worst part about telling people I work at an oil & propane company is the inevitable response of "really?? Did you actually want to work in that industry??"
1585 2018-09-17 20:31:17 Great Fast Service Done By a Very Friendly Staff. Thank You Take 5 Oil Change..
1586 2018-09-17 20:31:14 Wondered why these chips I got from the store yesterday were making me sick. Or rather I ignored it thinking it was my usual stomach/gastro issues. Realize it's the chips. Look at ingredients. Sunflower oil. I can't eat sunflower oil. My stomach hates me.

1589 2018-09-17 20:30:58 Yes sir, I'm going through sleepless nights wondering how quickly people can ignore the truth and how quickly they change sides. When fuel prices were rising during UPA (oil 100$ per barrel) @akshaykumar ji & @SrBachchan ji were so vocal about it, now what happen.

1597 2018-09-17 20:30:08 I had healed my Hashimoto's down to remission level when I took a job in Africa. They knew I couldn't do gluten and didn't serve me wheat. But the kitchen at the camp cooked donuts every week in oil and re-used the oil all week in EVERY OTHER DISH. I lost all my health gains. :(
1598 2018-09-17 20:30:07 We had the same with the Brum one last year. They had to change the route twice and there were dicks who put tacks and oil on the road on the day itself.
1599 2018-09-17 20:30:01 witchiness is cool in theory but once you start thinking rubbing oil from an orange (no idea what the oil comes out of) on your skin is going to make you happy and make you less nervous you need to stop and fix your problems in a real way
1600 2018-09-17 20:30:00 I'm interested in an answer as well. In addition to the devastating environmental impact, a loved one is deathly allergic to palm oil.
1601 2018-09-17 20:29:58 Yeah.  Very little detail that you need to get to.  I just undercoated it all leadbelcher and then a nuln oil wash and then started on the bits you can see!
1602 2018-09-17 20:29:46 Venezuela is a crime scene, if the legitimate Supreme Court orders an embargo against oil sales the U.S. Navy should assist in effectuating a legal blockade that would safely sever the regime's funding lifeline and force an exit with bloodshed @TSJ_Legitimo

I hate it. I miss my kids and my woman, my fridge and bed too lol. And it never gets easier, just harder.
1619 2018-09-17 20:27:37 I still expect a lot of Iranian oil to be sold to China and India. Beyond That? Not much.

1666 2018-09-17 20:22:49 Two 8% drops in Canadian Oil. Each drop means the refinery margins go up exponentially, because Brent and WTI still trade high, the lower feedstock makes for increased gains differential-wise, watch VLO and IMO and CRAK next few weeks.

1708 2018-09-17 20:17:33 Kemi Adeosun learnt one big lesson, if you want to fight every sector , stay away from oil cabal. The moment she scream non remittance of money in nnpc, someone opened her own page of the book.sad

1747 2018-09-17 20:12:54 By keeping those coal plants open Alberta absolutely locks in increased emissions for the next 20-30 years. By losing the Climate Leadership Plan Alberta loses the firm cap on oil sands emissions they committed to. Also locks in increases 1/
1748 2018-09-17 20:12:45 1. Why so much increasing petrol price? :  High Petrol Prices are in line with Crude Oil. Currently both Centre and State Govt (including Congress) dont want to reduce the tax as it will increase deficit. High Deficit will increase inflation and will hurt common people.
1749 2018-09-17 20:12:37 The fallacy of graph is that is assumes environmental degradation is linear.  It does not account for technological advancements which are always improving efficiencies pushing the curve down.  Like peak oil theory which time and time again shown to be false. #science

1751 2018-09-17 20:12:12 and my addition (very consistent with Bernanke, indeed he has also emphasized it) is that a lot of the saving in EMs was policy induced.    Oil exporters make a spend v save choice with a windfall.   But China also reigned in credit in 2003 -- helping to preserve its XR

1756 2018-09-17 20:11:31 also something called OPEC then..... the cartel tripled oil/gas prices from $10 barrel to $33 barrel, gas lines in US that was 90% dependent on foreign oil then.......to put in perspective that'd be oil prices going from $70 to $225 per barrel today.

1760 2018-09-17 20:10:39 Oh dear! No crunchies. Mum could ask vet for something to soothe your gums. Hoomans can use clove oil (diluted) or tea bags (the tannin). After the op, you sleep; Mum has a stiff drink or two.. Be brave.

1790 2018-09-17 20:07:24 They can, spark plugs are steel and ceramic, oil and steel on filters are recycled and rubber is also recycled, plastic can now be made into petrol and jet fuel too or recycled. There are new battery technologies that use just water and Graphene which will be a game changer
1791 2018-09-17 20:07:17 I take it this deosn't apply to CBD oil.  If they start that they will receive a very steep learning curve.

1815 2018-09-17 20:03:45 Ive had worse. I was served reused oil from recooked hot Indian food. I was like 8 and gaged. Dad said 'don't be rude shut up and drink it thinking I was being picky over foreign drinks'. I cant forget that taste.
1816 2018-09-17 20:03:42 I’ve given one of my coworkers a ride home soo much that she almost need to help pay for my oil changes. You are helping with putting miles on my car boo
1817 2018-09-17 20:03:37 In as little as 15 yrs the oil demand will plummet to just a fraction of current demands. Look around the world, read articles from Asia and Europe.

1825 2018-09-17 20:02:20 I know nothing about furnaces, but burning oil for any reason still feels like wartime measures.
1826 2018-09-17 20:02:09 You want to repeal the meat and oil subisdies? Ok.

Last time I checked ,we were all paying for climate change already though. I'm all for charging polluters.
1827 2018-09-17 20:01:48 I really think it's important that women, especially if you drive yourself , know the basics of a car...To change a tyre, fill in water , oil and brake fluid. The feeling of knowing  to do such is empowering
1828 2018-09-17 20:01:28 Oh dear oh dear on two counts “Men’s Health”...what were you thinking? Coconut Oil was found in an RCT to come out tops compared with EVOO and butter! HDL-C increases massively with little change in LDL-C. As with Avocados being high in calories. Cos calories count REALLY?! 
1829 2018-09-17 20:01:21 Due to coming sanctions? I would think since they are getting oil from Iran, all is good.

1841 2018-09-17 20:00:22 My intolerance towards independence is because of the lack of credible facts and figures from the pro-Indy side—the "oil is just a bonus" lie (it was the basis); the lies about the revenue (£30bn shortfall already!); and now the attitude that the lies were acceptable.
1842 2018-09-17 20:00:20 I need an oil change and a car wash. I’ll probably do both Wednesday morning

1862 2018-09-17 19:58:58 You may not require a reply, but your statement merits a response. A rhetorical question (since you probably won't read this)—should we just ignore the fact that if we had voted 'Yes' in 2014 then we'd be at least £30bn worse off purely because of SNP's oil revenue lies?

1868 2018-09-17 19:58:15 The equipment he rented also has a tendency to leak oil so they’re investigating runoff damage

1883 2018-09-17 19:56:15 Option 2 is inaccurate because the US is adamant about protecting the YPG. 

Now that a decision on Idlib has been reached Russia, Turkey, Iran and the Regime can concentrate on the YPG. Assad wants his oil back and the Astana 3 see the YPG as the biggest threat to Syrian soil.

1889 2018-09-17 19:55:36 Yeah, I think it's definitely dipped into the 40s here. And I'm too scared to use the existing oil furnace, which is like 50-60+ years old.
1890 2018-09-17 19:55:15 OoOoOo I gotta try it out. I’ve been using a matte balm from elf but only on the parts my face gets oily in lately but tea tree oil is so good I might try that one!! Yep the cleanser is AMAZING  they have little $5 bottles if you wanna give them a try

1898 2018-09-17 19:53:57 So true
1899 2018-09-17 19:53:34 They still don't.  @HillaryClinton orchestrated the smear campaign and defamation of numerous women with credible claims.  They still consider her their president.
This woman is nothing more than a means to an end to them.
1900 2018-09-17 19:53:22 Larry Kudlow believes that deficits don't matter. He believed that when he worked for Reagan and now we are 21 trillion in the hole. He was also for overproduction in oil. Look what happened when oil hit $30. I am sure that he believes that farmers can ride out the storm too.

1908 2018-09-17 19:52:25 Also its entirely possible to have pipelines and meet a 2 degree target. I get the target is "no oil" but the ask to go "no petroleum tomorrow" is so far beyond what we are currently capable of. Do we object to rope or clothing? (nylon) rubbing alcohol?

1918 2018-09-17 19:51:03 I’m so overdue for an oil change because every time I try and get one, something just HAS to come up and I don’t have time to get it done until days later, then something else comes up after that and it’s just a never ending cycle

1927 2018-09-17 19:49:35 Sometimes I wonder why the elites of #NOLA seem more concerned with chasing after oil and gas dollar$ than reversing climate change.

Maybe they never skinnied up behind a utility pole to get a few degrees respite while baking in the noon sun while waiting for a once an hour bus?

1933 2018-09-17 19:48:35 That is is "gram equivalent" not the actual weight of the oil.

It's different for every LP but the 37 grams of oil is probably equal to 5-10g of dried cannabis in that conversion

1948 2018-09-17 19:46:25 Also claiming Scandinavia is somehow a “planned economy” is … wildly baffling. Maybe they’ve got larger public sectors or state oil that they don’t run into the ground like Venezuela, but they’re still broadly capitalist with wildly different social norms than the USA.
1949 2018-09-17 19:46:24 When you go shopping next look at the fat content of food. It's very surprising. Once I knew the problem, I lived off of jacket potatoes and baked beans for months. Cheap sliced white bread is the best and a small amount of Olive oil is OK.
1950 2018-09-17 19:46:24 my opinion is he's a snake oil salesman. did he recruit better than what had been happening the prior 2 years at SMU? sure, but anyone could have b/c @CoachJuneJones quit recruiting after he *accepted* the ASU and we couldn't afford the buyout after their fans ran him off.

1975 2018-09-17 19:43:54 Galbani do a lovely, long, loaf-shaped mozzarella (the Maxi) which happily feeds 4, for £2. Wonderful with tomato, olive oil, black pepper, torn basil leaf, and salt
1976 2018-09-17 19:43:38 I’ve got beard oil just for you bruh

1979 2018-09-17 19:43:14 Me: fuck, I'm hungry *and* lazy. What did I eat before my body fell apart
Brain: pastaroni
Me: okay...measure lentil noodles, add 2x liquid, a splash of oil, some seasoning, and simmer until the liquid mostly vanishes. Maybe it'll be soupy but oh well

Me: hey this isn't too bad
1980 2018-09-17 19:43:07 Fun with melt and pour soap today! These are an organic olive oil base with my rosewood and patchouli blend of essential oils and a dollop if honey. It smells awesome and I love the golden honey hue when the sun hits it 
1981 2018-09-17 19:42:56 I'm concerned for sourcing medical CBD and THC oil from transparent BC sources, to treat my mothers arthritis. National #Access referred to an East coast business that has had pesticide recalls.
1982 2018-09-17 19:42:49 Gee I shoulda guessed you and @ericadyork woulda written this already. I just read #KeyFindings which nails it. Will read rest too. Thanks much, keep at it! Seems TX can survive a lot of economic mistakes sitting on all that oil. I wonder how Ohio survives it?

1985 2018-09-17 19:42:43 I recently saw a list placing America at the top of oil producing nations!
America catching up with the world with their shale gas!!
What is wrong with Nigeria folks, how can we favorably play in the world economy with leaders like the ones we currently have
1986 2018-09-17 19:42:43 I think I'm going to try & attempt to do my first full body oil show & set it as a goal this Friday! What do you all think?

It could be that they found non-commercial oil and are testing and sampling!

Hopefully we've a commercial asset!

1990 2018-09-17 19:41:58 It was  Olive oil that used a wrench to break the toy top
1991 2018-09-17 19:41:57 Traditional oil paints & thank you!! I did it with yellow purple and white paint only

1993 2018-09-17 19:41:52 Please check Zwane and Tina’s involvement in the R3Billion DE oil discount-offset on Optimum shares. Did the discount end with Glencore Energy and  the Optimun shares with the Gupta & Zuma-Tegeta-clan? All under the watch of cadres Brain, Anjo, Glasenberg & NO1?
1994 2018-09-17 19:41:35 I did that for my fam and now my dad wears a brown hat everyday when he goes out to the oil fields. I'm sure they'll love the gear.

2005 2018-09-17 19:40:28 This girl infront of me at the oil change placed told the dudes dont try anything on me because i'll go outside and check it myself lmfao D E A D
2006 2018-09-17 19:40:21 Afghanistan is like the crude oil prices, increasing everyday.

Whereas, Sri Lanka is like the Ruppee. Falling, falling and falling.
2007 2018-09-17 19:40:20 And probably rancid beard oil as well.
2008 2018-09-17 19:40:10 Working on oil and gas you always have to keep in mind that the resources are not finite , and what are you going to do if the inevitable happens
2009 2018-09-17 19:40:10 ん、これ油変えた？あーなるほど、ごま油をひまわり油で割ったのか。
2010 2018-09-17 19:40:08 Worse, it's mostly palm oil which does double duty damage to your insides + the rainforest
2011 2018-09-17 19:40:07 Face or body? I started using this face oil that has helped me tons and I love using coconut oil or this bomb coconut Shea for body.
2012 2018-09-17 19:40:07 For the first time since 1973, the United States is the world's largest producer of crude oil, according to preliminary estimates published on Wednesday by the Energy Department. The feat demonstrates how the US shale oil boom has reshaped the global energy landscape.
2013 2018-09-17 19:40:04 CBD oil & shrooms have been my medicine lately .

2015 2018-09-17 19:39:52 This is after I “revived” it by adding oil and chilies once already
2016 2018-09-17 19:39:49 @BirdsEye I can't find the vegetable pasta (Penne olive oil) ANYWHERE near me...all stores are sold out or not carrying... please advise where can I buy this product??? #itsallIeat

2018 2018-09-17 19:39:38 Finally bought a essential oil diffuser 
2019 2018-09-17 19:39:27 A turn to nuclear power would be great. It's a clean (and statistically safe) way to supply energy to the populace, and could help diminish greatly our dependence on foreign sources of oil. I do hope our leaders are considering this route seriously. @realDonaldTrump
2020 2018-09-17 19:39:20 This booty need motor oil
2021 2018-09-17 19:39:18 The more I read the more I want to try CBD oil after I give birth. There are some big benefits to it that really make it worth it in my mind.
2022 2018-09-17 19:39:12 I’m bored at Walmart wishing I brought a friend while I wait for my oil change
2023 2018-09-17 19:38:59 you could also try a dose of sprays of CBD oil! Has amazing benefits including reducing stress and anxiety 
2024 2018-09-17 19:38:54 And we are naturally fair not jikked! Also we don't use too much  nmanu! (oil) very subtle
2025 2018-09-17 19:38:46 Peppermint essential oil usually helps me. Put a drop or two on your palm, rub your hands together to spread the oil, then cup your hands to your face and breathe in deeply a few times. It's amazing how much that can wake you up, FAST.
2026 2018-09-17 19:38:46 Find out what oil you use before you go because if not the people will try to make you spend way more than what you actually need!
2027 2018-09-17 19:38:46 I have a legitimate question. How on earth are super long lines at disney world on a Monday in September? shouldn't kids be back in school and the parks be empty? I'm asking because I'm bored waiting for an oil change and I looked at my disney app for fun.
2028 2018-09-17 19:38:41 To the goon who’s exhaust dropped off in the middle of the A1231 today and they left it. I hit it at 70, almost crashed and luckily for you didn’t split my oil sump in 2. I really hope karma bites you back for being a total stupid cunt.
2029 2018-09-17 19:38:38 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.

2035 2018-09-17 19:37:48 You are hilarious.Obesogenic endocrine disrupting GE seed canola,soy and corn oil sales have taken over the world and dwarfed sales of my extra special oil.If you use Roundup in an olive grove you risk xyella fastidiosa. Now devestating olive trees in Europe.
2036 2018-09-17 19:37:38 a gentle reminder that artwork is not better or more valid because it is an in depth oil painting made over the course of many months, some of the best works are tiny monotypes done in 10 minutes. thanks for coming to my ted talk
2037 2018-09-17 19:37:30 Last week was a love fest on energy stocks on CNBC. Not looking so good now! After this next leg down in OIL they will be bearish and calling for 30s again. Thats when we go long
2038 2018-09-17 19:37:29 so i have to get an oil change by myself and i’m actually terrified #help
2039 2018-09-17 19:37:28 I sat with a very old rich oil mogul man yesterday. And after analysing all his experiences, he came to a conclusion that from time immemorial, 'China never mean well for us'.

2043 2018-09-17 19:36:30 You mean from plants?  Nah they don’t cause any issues. Humans naturally eat refine deodorized rape seed oil
2044 2018-09-17 19:36:14 With the cbd oil it needs to go under your tongue to work the best
2045 2018-09-17 19:35:50 I used olive oil as lube in mine so it would stop screaming as it goes up and down.

2048 2018-09-17 19:35:36 Don't be delusional and hateful, your playoff run hinged on Talbot maintaining his unbelievable year, it sadly wasn't repeatable, I like the Oil, but to defend China's decisions is absurd
2049 2018-09-17 19:35:21 Man made Climate Change ? Now wondering if "Big Oil" was responsible for Dinosaur Extinction?
2050 2018-09-17 19:35:12 I think you need to look at oil and gas revenues over the last few years, and realise that our oil is the most expensive to produce in the world. Westminster subsidises Holyrood at the moment. You are living in dream land.

However, I don't recommend dumping oil into the sea

2107 2018-09-17 19:28:41 @TransCanada Your company is the most advanced with Renewable Energy.  I strongly recommend deploying enough Renewables to replace fossil fuels.  We can still use oil for lubrication.  I recommend you start deployment in West Virginia, help coals miners transition.
2108 2018-09-17 19:28:37 I’ve had 5 cars already wtf I bet I know how to drive the speed limit and get oil changes now cus I will not keep doing this
2109 2018-09-17 19:28:18 I don't have any experience with the gummies but I put the oil in my coffee every morning so if he drinks coffee or tea I find it's a good way to disguise it.
2110 2018-09-17 19:28:12 E-mobility is going to end oil boom.

2111 2018-09-17 19:28:06 Most of those either have oil (Qatar, Brunei, Norway, UAE, Kuwait) or are tax havens, which attract the rich (Liechtenstein, Monaco, Macau, Isle of Man, Bermuda). But in any case, all wealth is ultimately created by resources, isn't it? And resources are finite. That's my point.
2112 2018-09-17 19:27:58 Ok how can we con Shell in2 oh I don't know, collecting urine instead of drilling 4 oil. There's a phosferous shortage. Urine is GREAT fertiliser. If only it powered cars!
2113 2018-09-17 19:27:40 Lmfaoooo I’m weak! Aye it will be much cheaper then spending it on gas  and oil change and all that extra stuff
2114 2018-09-17 19:27:40 You can't even get off oil, by the time the oil companies get through with the world in 2030, may be 10 times as worse.
2115 2018-09-17 19:27:39 Same question could be asked about oil and gas subsidies.  Must just be a coincidence that y’all don’t ask that question though...

Or could it be because your board is made up of oil and gas millionaires and billionaires?  
2116 2018-09-17 19:27:37 Saying this with respect, are you saying Oil and Gas are operating as free market sources now? If there is an even playing field find, but don't cherry pick subsidies.

2124 2018-09-17 19:26:39 Saudi Arabia's PIF (equivalent of Nigeria's SWF) just invested $1b in Lucid (electric auto maker)

Saudi Arabia pumps more crude oil than Nigeria... It is diversifying from oil

Nigeria keeps glorying in our poverty mindset which gives us the faux impression that we are rich

2135 2018-09-17 19:25:40 Today, I renewed my license plates, renewed my actual license, got an oil change, did the grocery shopping, found a place for winterizing my car, and went for a 3mile walk.

2217 2018-09-17 19:17:21 You hit the nail on the head. The government and those in power haven't figured out how to make money off it. Same reason why we haven't seen "flying car" technology yet. Gas and oil industry haven't figured out how to cash in on it.

2232 2018-09-17 19:15:39 Sure... Its only your Maggi n salt that can mess you up.. 
Ohhh.. And boil your animals with onions first.. To soften it. 
Then add your pepper, oil, seasoning everything to the same pot and cover it up. 
That's the best way for you.

2241 2018-09-17 19:13:59 The first thing to do is to gather the folks who designed that forsaken FBR website and boil them in oil.

2246 2018-09-17 19:13:30 AND...His conflation of socialism with fascism is a classic. The end stage capitalism we suffer, teetering on oligarchy & kleptocracy is far closer to fascist policy than good social democracy. Don't let #PeterWallison snake oil soothe you. Can't believe how long he's been loose.
2247 2018-09-17 19:13:28 Nonsense. We are just picking up scraps of a vibrant  USA economy + decent oil prices, otherwise this country would be in recession. US GDP 4.2%, CDN 2.5%, US jobless 3.9%, CDN jobless 6.0. Most F/T CDN jobs R public sector, US mostly private. CDN Deficits as far as eye can see.
2248 2018-09-17 19:13:06 sort of linked when the high savings were in Asian economies that recycled everything through central bank balance sheets and the oil exporters.   The big savers (e.g. large surplus countries) institutionally wanted "safe" as in credit risk free assets.

2252 2018-09-17 19:12:48 Thieves essential oil in the diffuser. All day every day.
2253 2018-09-17 19:12:45 I made a tough decision today to not renew my @ColumbusCrewSC tickets for next year as long as @APrecourt is the owner. It’s lunacy to me what @thesoccerdon has allowed to happen and the fact this snake oil salesman wants money from people in a city he has trashed is the icing
2254 2018-09-17 19:12:18 Black seed oil !!!! It’s a life saver
2255 2018-09-17 19:12:17 @KL_ATL Past 2 Years I have studied cannabis Sativa aka hempseed oil has been known as Sacred Oil with great benefits. It’s a complex oil with great benefits.good for For body internally as well as topical applications.Its main benefits are for digestive system&Myelin protection
2256 2018-09-17 19:12:09 I think you'll find Auckland are paying the Regional Tax it's just that the Fuel/Oil Companies are ripping youse off as much as per usual.
2257 2018-09-17 19:12:01 I'll take it. That's a solid number for the Oil and leaves us room to make a move once Sekera hits LTIR.

2262 2018-09-17 19:11:39 We have transformed the standard oil delivery system from manufacturer to wholesaler to distributor to consumer (Whew! that's a lot of travel).
2263 2018-09-17 19:11:36 I got the meet Christian a few weeks ago. He’s a super nice guy and loves being part of your team!
2264 2018-09-17 19:11:31 Our Vets deserve to be free to use Hemp oil & Vape for pain & anxiety. It is not Pot, won't get you high, it's legal in all 50 states, the U.S. government owns the patent on it, so please separate Hemp from Pot as an illegal substance & make it available through the VA. God Bless
2265 2018-09-17 19:11:11 Palmers oil, either the coco butter one or the rosemary. Both work well. Also try witch hazel.
2266 2018-09-17 19:11:11 least it is a small bottle for your panniers.
2267 2018-09-17 19:11:11 I sauté it with a little butter or olive oil and add Italian spices  it cooks suuuuper quick.
2268 2018-09-17 19:11:10 To be sure the peak includes a lot of inflows into EMs that are recycled back into reserves -- it isn't just the Asian + oil current account surplus.  But accomodating the recycling wasn't easy.   think you end up ...

2276 2018-09-17 19:10:18 My sister almost messed up her engine skipping oil changes and my brothers have been chastising her for 10 minutes now. 

Our dad would be so proud. LOL!!

2278 2018-09-17 19:10:02 The GOP wants a win & will do anything to get it. Morals & ethics be damned. None of them fear job loss. Most have huge amounts of money. The rest will end up as members of think tanks, get corrupt corporate jobs (oil anyone?), or end up on the talk circuit. They. Don’t. Care.

2300 2018-09-17 19:06:32 When we stop importing oil and instead power electric cars with wind and solar energy from here in Minnesota, we will have cleaner air, more jobs, a stronger economy, and fewer negative #ClimateChange impacts. @mn_seia @CUB_MN @cleanenergymn @MNlocalenergy

2302 2018-09-17 19:06:25 Clove oil. It always works. Dentists use it too so that it partially heals the decay when they can't immediately work on a very deep cavity.
2303 2018-09-17 19:06:18 Oil price variation most likely

2317 2018-09-17 19:04:42 If you use EV for 90% of your 8000 miles driven; why does it tell you to change your oil if it has only been 6 months?

2322 2018-09-17 19:03:31 Ig they have to clean my A/C pump and fuel filter so that's what cost so much bc the rest is just oil change and tire rotation which normally is only $60. I just need my car to be in good condition for Life is Beautiful so I can make good money but ugh I'm so mad it's expensive

2354 2018-09-17 19:00:00 Cruz is like a 2 bit crook. He's so blatantly a snake oil salesman, it's hard to even take him seriously as a villain. He's like if Saul Goodman had 0 charisma and no positive attributes of any kind.

McConnell really is just evil incarnate.
2355 2018-09-17 18:59:47 I hear bio oil is really good!
2356 2018-09-17 18:59:24 I don’t think sears does oil change
2357 2018-09-17 18:59:23 I think it might be? The front porch spider moved a couple of times and I just found the oil tank spider moved his web towards the garbage cans last night.
2358 2018-09-17 18:59:21 Is it the dry oil spray or the leave in conditioner?
2359 2018-09-17 18:59:10 No, I'm sorry Turnip. I just don't see you as a "smothered in butter" kinda vegetable. Pickled, maybe some butter with your greens, but I like to use oil better.
2360 2018-09-17 18:59:07 They've had oil the whole time, they still have social upheaval - so, given those conditions, why was there a break in lending and why has it resumed?

2364 2018-09-17 18:57:51 True. Wind turbines, in fact, do not generate as much energy as one would hope for. Furthermore, I don't think everyone is are aware of the amount of crude oil that is mandatory for the manufacture of solar panels and wind turbines. That is part why I made no mention of the two.
2365 2018-09-17 18:57:38 can you imagine me with a glass of that.

2375 2018-09-17 18:56:53 i used tea tree oil and it went away in like 2-3 days!
2376 2018-09-17 18:56:49 Scheduled oil change and I’ve been waiting for 2 hours now. A free oil change is not worth the long wait 
2377 2018-09-17 18:56:30 And the oil goons will fund it?
2378 2018-09-17 18:56:20 It seems to me that NOT SELLING OIL to other countries ( esp. those not concerned about the Environment) would actually do more for the Environ. and keep it off our oceans! REFINE IN CANADA for CANADIANS!
2379 2018-09-17 18:56:16 It's the innocent men, women, and children overseas that we murder on a daily basis in the name of oil and defense contractors. That's where the hatred comes from. It's from the proud ignorance of jingoists like you who delude themselves into thinking the US only does good.
2380 2018-09-17 18:56:15 I need a oil change

2394 2018-09-17 18:54:38 IIRC alcohol has more calories than oil. Anyway, a good recipe. 

Here's one in return:

Sauce: Orange juice & walnut oil, pickled capers, garlic, "herbs of the Provence", salt&pepper.

Main ingredients: Cucumber, tomato, bell pepper, feta, tuna, (onion rings on top).
2395 2018-09-17 18:54:29 Nixon's Trashing of the 20 year-stable Gold Standard; permitted the Dollar to be floated; and, that brought Predators out in Droves.  Also brought a Decade of extreme financial hardship as Nation had to combat Oil Embargoes, Wage & Price Controls; and, very high Inflation!
2396 2018-09-17 18:54:23 That is true.. But.. And a big BUT.. Why they are silent over big issues in present govt.?? Such as hike in petrol prices, dep. of Rupee, and succumbing under US pressure in oil import from Iran?? In my opinion, they should now act as all these flaws will effect them too..
2397 2018-09-17 18:54:20 OIT - Oral Immunotherapy Dr supervised intro of allergen - Natural, no drugs. Still allergic, but desensitized.  I am a mom who watched her child go into anaphylaxis.  I have put this out there before, people gave me links that pnut oil is in immunizations but link was broken.
2398 2018-09-17 18:54:07 Note: Norwegian gas costs up 18%. Maybe we could just keep our own gas/ oil & England can import Norwegian.
2399 2018-09-17 18:54:00 I never thought I would be an oil diffuser stan and yet... here I am
2400 2018-09-17 18:53:57 She knows where she's going to get the money. By,  jack up our taxes, possibly jack up gas & oil tax, tax the  middle class until they disappear. Then actors & actresses &  the political government top officials will live comfortably never giving up their percentage to socialism
2401 2018-09-17 18:53:57 I love when the oil refinery burns off excess gas, it makes the entire South Bay smell like burnt rubber
2402 2018-09-17 18:53:56 Agreed. Caring about one thing DOES NOT exclude or negate your care or concern for the other. These are both important. One just needs more attention right now. If your oil light came on would you say that getting an oil change meant that you don’t care about the rest of you car?

2405 2018-09-17 18:53:28 I have nothing else positive to say about Obamacare, everything that was predicted to go wrong with it went wrong (gee, if only someone had warned them), but to say it did "nothing" is not accurate (and triggered my OCD).
2406 2018-09-17 18:53:28 I've seen a ton of posts lately about anxiety. Seems like its covering my fb feed .. y'all seriously need to look into CBD oil!
2407 2018-09-17 18:53:16 Sitting in the car getting my oil changed wit a frustrated Nicholas is NOT how I want to spend my day ...
2408 2018-09-17 18:53:06 Honestly that’s all I use. I had a huge Afro and cut it 6 weeks ago then started grow my hair afresh using the coconut oil and I’m seeing a huge difference

2411 2018-09-17 18:52:58 to top it off palm oil is also really hard to cultivate healthily for the environment
2412 2018-09-17 18:52:56 right? it was uhhh... a real big yikes. can you not use a good sentiment to push some snake oil and diet culture?
2413 2018-09-17 18:52:49 #PANR looking strong as the story unfolds in a perky oil price environment. Acquisition, joint venture partnership and revenue all in the space of weeks.

2415 2018-09-17 18:52:34 Your mcm told you your car need an alignment and an oil change...he didn’t offer to pay.
2416 2018-09-17 18:52:10 Interesting how media, including CBC, frames political narrative. Specifically, the importance of “oil.” Given the global climate trajectory we are on, disappointing and discouraging. #surreal
2417 2018-09-17 18:51:50 Coconut oil helps get rid of the orange but keeps the tan!!!!

2421 2018-09-17 18:51:12 @ProfNoelFitz ‘I’m no oil painting and a workaholic freak’. I would just like to say, one of the most attractive things about a man is his ability to see his own flaws and whilst I disagree completely with your analogy of yourself,passion for the job outweighs anything else 
2422 2018-09-17 18:51:08 Algae could save you. +50% of algae is oil. We're talking about biofuels that could power everything. You could end up in a carbon negative situation where the byproduct is clean drinking water & hog food! Alabama is already doing it!
2423 2018-09-17 18:51:06 I do do them....when I have that massive amount of oil lol
2424 2018-09-17 18:50:46 Just fripperies then? Like oil, gas, electricity, water.
2425 2018-09-17 18:50:44 The Holy Spirits job in your life is like: 1) A seal (to reveal Jesus) 
2) Wind (to guide us) 
3) Fire (to convict us)
4) Oil (to comfort us) 
5) water (to remind and refresh us)
2426 2018-09-17 18:50:43 Actually your Russian government and your allies hezbollah and IRGC are the ones terrorizing the people in Syria and aided ISIS and Al-Qaeda by buying their oil and attacking the anti-ISIS forces
2427 2018-09-17 18:50:39 She's playing to low information voters.
The markets do this daily and quarterly in forecasts/ conference calls.  Global market forces, supply and demand have more effect than climate on corp value

2432 2018-09-17 18:50:02 Since May, I eat a whole damn plate of bacon, butter, coco oil, beef, chicken, fish daily; some intermittent fast 2x week, and load up with Arginine, glutamine, lysine big dose supplements. Been bodybuilding 30yrs- I'm stronger, leaner and more vascular than ever.  Period.

2435 2018-09-17 18:49:56 You're welcomeLol same I was waking around looking like a damn oil spill, but this has worked so far for me. 
2436 2018-09-17 18:49:54 Well OF COURSE we run out of heating oil just when it gets Baltic. OF COURSE THAT HAPPENED.

2439 2018-09-17 18:49:35 snake oil is a lie

2443 2018-09-17 18:48:58 Who wants in on my monthly draw for a free bottle of cbd oil
must purchase from my website

2444 2018-09-17 18:48:55 Airgate Centre, popularly known as Taj Mall — which was demolished on Saturday — sat on oil pipeline, the Kenya Pipeline Company (KPC) has said.
2445 2018-09-17 18:48:53 Didn’t notice too much change in the forecourt due to the weak oil price. But obviously as oil is bought & hedged ahead, it’ll only be a £ per litre in 6 months time...
2446 2018-09-17 18:48:49 OIL OIL OIL . と紙に書くとサザエさんに聞こえる。
2447 2018-09-17 18:48:46 Yeah that sounds really nice!! 
One of my friends had this shot of some type of drink that would make sure she wouldn't get hungry and I though that was really cool. For the makeup one, I'd definitely recommend some type of face towel that can dab off sweat or oil
2448 2018-09-17 18:48:40 I had pasta/pesto/cheese/pine nuts/oil, Jaffa cakes and strawberry/melon for afters.
2449 2018-09-17 18:48:36 Shampoo for your face is a very bad idea. 
It really cuts the oil in your face down (which you need some) and can increase your chances of break outs and what not. 

As weird as this sounds, I use an oil cleanser to keep zits off the face 
2450 2018-09-17 18:48:36 I have my girly girl side, but I also just got under my truck and changed my oil. Get a girl who can do both 
2451 2018-09-17 18:48:35 We have new shops coming to 50th & France! Cocinnella, a boutique olive oil and vinegar shop, is looking to expand their staff.

Email info@50thandfrance.com for more information on how to apply!
2452 2018-09-17 18:48:32 its super easy and fast tbh!

cook mock chicken in garlic, ginger, soy sauce, sesame oil. add sprouts, mushrooms, spring onion roots. shortly after add veggie broth & cashew cream. bring to boil. set to low. mix in miso & chili pastes. add sesame oil on top. serve over noodles.
2453 2018-09-17 18:48:26 Not our debt. Devolved Gov can't exceed budgets/borrow! Without subsidising your oil, electricity, & export rev our GDP will improve.
2454 2018-09-17 18:48:25 That video was epic! But how does Wall St. leverage an asset class like Bitcoin that will become a Medium of Exchange as well?  They can control the supply of gold, oil, etc. and we can't effectively trade those items.  But Bitcoin?  2nd and 3rd layer apps will change the game!
2455 2018-09-17 18:48:09 Thanks Mark, Wee know you love our CBD oil  | Welcome to the family Wee Hemper
2456 2018-09-17 18:48:00 My mom told me to put coconut oil on my face cause it was so fucking dry! And now I can’t even rest my face on my hand cause I’ll slide right off! 
2457 2018-09-17 18:47:54 The world runs on oil and will continue to do for decades . It is irrelevant what Canada does.
2458 2018-09-17 18:47:50 This is what “selling out” looks like kids. McKenna, you are nothing more than a shill and crony for big oil.
2459 2018-09-17 18:47:39 My bad I meant Hatch. The Mitch McConnell hates them too. Oren Hatch is the quintessential snake oil salesman IMHO
2460 2018-09-17 18:47:38 Trying to figure out what the rationale is for discontinuing a multivitamin and fish oil a week before a scheduled surgery?

2463 2018-09-17 18:47:31 Not an accident - the oil cartels & motor vehicle makers can't afford to have Americans thinking that driving = death.

2467 2018-09-17 18:46:48 Stay with me here, what if all of the shops that became $TSLA certified were actually part of a massive sabotage plot FUNDED BY BIG OIL!!! to bring on $TSLAQ.  Well, they'd have my support.
2468 2018-09-17 18:46:41 I buy CBG isolate from @leafandoilUK. Although I also take the hybrid CBD oil from @InfoMolytor which contains higher levels of CBG.

2471 2018-09-17 18:46:22 Put out an image that they are for the common man, but they are absolute snake oil salesman looking out for their own dollar. Play the victim card their whole lives in order to succeed. Typical.

Baby oil & shave w. the hair & not against it. She got all bent and said she shaves w. A woman’s razor. Um ok Bumbs MaGee
2475 2018-09-17 18:46:05 Hemp and cannabis have a multitude of purposes not being used today because of the heavy stigma and legal problems. Growing on mars could lead to a more efficiency than we have here today. Just a few of its purposes include, clothing, rope, paper, oil, ect. The list goes on..
2476 2018-09-17 18:46:03 Is the oil, that’s used in porn scenes, a name brand or is it mixed/made specifically for content?
2477 2018-09-17 18:45:40 I live in a rural area where we are used to power outages. Our drill is put all electronic items on to charge. Put battery lanterns & oil lamps in prominent spots & make sure all vehicle windows are closed.

Cooking for them is my love language.

2483 2018-09-17 18:44:19 The ? is what don't I have....... I have every documentary, whistleblower testimony, generals talking about it being done from within our own government, leaked emails talking about how it was Mossad & our own CIA involved. All to justify invading Iraq for regime change, oil,ect

2500 2018-09-17 18:42:13 The “Law of similars” is not just fantasy. It is dishonest. 

Homeopathy is immorally dishonest about evidence and physical reality.

Our contempt for “the butcher with his thumb on the scale” extends to these snake oil salesmen.  They are not stupid. They are vile.
2501 2018-09-17 18:42:03 can neverrrrrr allow my legs to be ashy lol , I wash my ass and then I lotion and THEN I rub in some baby oil all over . needs all that moisture

2506 2018-09-17 18:41:57 That is high! If I have chips I use baby potatoes (68kcals/100g) and a table spoon (and a half) of veg oil in a halogen frier thing lol.

2511 2018-09-17 18:41:09 Egg and pecorino cheese make the cream, that must not be cooked. Take the guanciale (i suppose bacon is fine) and cook it a while in a pan, without oil or butter: the grease from the meat is enough. Cook the pasta in boiling water, use the colander to remove the water (1/2)
2512 2018-09-17 18:41:08 Obama is friends with Al Sharpton, Louis Farakhan, the Iranian Mullahs, Castro in Cuba and we are the bigots? Please go sell your snake oil bullshit somewhere else and take that clown of an ex vice president with you.

2517 2018-09-17 18:40:49 Just enjoyed a very tasty low carb Thai Red Chilli beef curry, with cauliflower rice, and french beans with white cabbage sautéed in coconut oil...

...trouble is, I hardly ever follow a recipe exactly, rarely measure the ingredients and never write it down.
2518 2018-09-17 18:40:45 coconut oil is the plug sis 
2519 2018-09-17 18:40:42 How can you have a deficit when you can’t borrow you fool

Scotland takes a burden of debt that Westminster creates so you know where to shove your so called deficit 

Plus the £15 billion hmrc found after coding oil that doesn’t land in Scotland as “unknown” would cover it

Fool
2520 2018-09-17 18:40:41 I'm finally getting an oil change.. surprised my car didnt die 1st.. it's been soooo long

2523 2018-09-17 18:40:19 The one where he is an attoney in the small rural town having issues with the oil company? Or the one that was I believe a real life story.. where the man was in prison for... I realize those are too vague answers however my brain is on shutdown mode due to stress lately
2524 2018-09-17 18:40:16 RT SenWarren On the other hand, if the global community follows through on commitments to limit global warming and move away from the use of fossil fuels, oil and gas companies could be worth a lot less.

2526 2018-09-17 18:40:06 The oil bond lying is going to blow up on BJPs face and the public is pissed. They deserve it,should have passed on benefits when crude prices were low.
2527 2018-09-17 18:39:58 こんな時間まで起きてるだなんて。。。！
2528 2018-09-17 18:39:58 Another regulatory expense, TAX,  placed on business to produce reports based on hypothetical scenarios and future events that may or may not happen. This is true no matter whether you are a believer or not.
2529 2018-09-17 18:39:53 gores2 gitu aku suka pake medicated oil kalo masih segar.. Ntar kalo lukanya udah kering gitu kasih vaseline rada mendingan deh
2530 2018-09-17 18:39:52 Apparently many of our foods weren’t stews or soups like they are now. More like raw ingredients mixed in an apotoriwa like they do the pepper that goes with Yam/ sweet potato and Tsofi. Then they may have just poured palm oil on it afterwards, or eaten as is.

2531 2018-09-17 18:39:52 if you r my friend and considering joining an essential oil social media pyramid scheme,dm me and i will venmo you the $4 that you would make off of that and you can keep your dignity and good standing in the community.

2532 2018-09-17 18:39:42 Yo my cousin said advise of the day (to all the females out there with stanky vagina y’all need to put coconut oil and keep that shit clean ) 
2533 2018-09-17 18:39:31 Standard Oil was split into several companies when it got to big & powerful, needs must!
2534 2018-09-17 18:39:29 I think the idea is oil will soon be $35 per barrel, Nigeria will turn Venezuela by then
2535 2018-09-17 18:39:14 Hii ni PR tu. Investigations have been done before and nothing was done. Infants and this hospital is like water and oil, they don't mix.
2536 2018-09-17 18:39:09 What good is in Nigeria. Poverty capital of the world, Numbe 1 skin bleachers in Africa and 2nd in the world. GDP is number 1 yet 90% oil, no diversification, hence poverty
2537 2018-09-17 18:39:08 Should be right around where the Oil pick.
2538 2018-09-17 18:39:04 Not THAT oil. 
2539 2018-09-17 18:38:56 My shoulders zinakaa nyoka ina shed skin. Coconut oil is helping a lot though
2540 2018-09-17 18:38:54 "What's the dumbest policy in the world? Public cash for oil and gas!" That's exactly what Canada is doing 
2541 2018-09-17 18:38:52 @opieoils can I order online and pick up in Redruth? Or do you guys stock in Redruth? Looking for "Fuchs TITAN GT1 PRO FLEX XTL 5W-30 Fully Synthetic Engine Oil - Service Pack: 5 litres" tho I'm just after the oil.
2542 2018-09-17 18:38:34 CBD oil is the bomb for post work out muscle pain!
2543 2018-09-17 18:38:32 I think the plan is to ruin the electric cars market so everybody buys oil from us 
2544 2018-09-17 18:38:26 They are our twin gods. Basically the living embodiment of the gemini if the gemini smelled like rancid baby oil and Zima and tried to get you to join a Resistance pyramid scheme every hour on the hour.
2545 2018-09-17 18:38:25 そういえば人生初のゴルフがはじまるかも！
2546 2018-09-17 18:37:56 Thank you. Just coconut oil fela?
2547 2018-09-17 18:37:30 No truffle oil?  Are you a savage?
2548 2018-09-17 18:37:24 Raitt: Justin said "Alberta's oil industry." It's all Canadian resource industries that are suffering.

Morneau: We botched the TMX pipeline because we know it's so important to Albertans.

2552 2018-09-17 18:36:45 I use to think that virgin olive oil was called virgin olive oil because the olives weren’t touching each other.  hence “virgin”.
2553 2018-09-17 18:36:32 Like trying to optimize oil lamp tech to get better lighting
2554 2018-09-17 18:36:24 Got to go get me A oil change soon
2555 2018-09-17 18:36:23 Im blowing out oil my blow by, but they say run it... so here I am just casually trying to seize up a motor.
2556 2018-09-17 18:36:00 The place I go to on south st has really good exfoliants for aftercare. The scrub has acids and peppermint oil in it and it’s the best feeling
2557 2018-09-17 18:35:56 did this one YEARS ago - oil on canvas - still one of my personal favourites though.
2558 2018-09-17 18:35:44 tell me why the guy who was changing the oil in my car pulled out his vape pen and started smoking like it was no big deal....
2559 2018-09-17 18:35:34 She must'a had a oil change
2560 2018-09-17 18:35:30 What a lot of bull. Stop the looting, retrieve the stolen billions, go fetch the oil you sold for under R3billion of the market price last year and gimme a beer and a Chesterfield... We have enough shit. Leave me and my sins alone 
2561 2018-09-17 18:35:12 ImO, Italy market was affected by UE's market factors:

Bullish:

Bearish:

Lower Gas Demand
2562 2018-09-17 18:35:08 If an oil vessel in custody can get missing what is a 'bombardier' in Nigeria?
2563 2018-09-17 18:34:58 Seconding whoever suggested the CBD oil, it’s worked wonders for me. If not try melatonin it’ll put you right to sleep 
2564 2018-09-17 18:34:53 WHEW, had to come confirm with oil country on Twitter. @drtwofive GET YOUR ASS HOME BABY!!!!
2565 2018-09-17 18:34:52 Left paints Kavenaugh as an existential threat to the country. Whether she's lying or not isn't important and doesnt matter to them. If she brings him down, she's a hero and saved the country, if not, at least she tried. Win-win for her either way.
2566 2018-09-17 18:34:40 China uses soft power in order to get access to African markets. They don’t interfere in the internal affairs of African affairs; instead, they build seaports, airports, roads, railroad, dams, oil & gas installations. When African countries can’t repay them, they use the raw 1/2
2567 2018-09-17 18:34:40 I just don't know what to try & where to get it from. I've tried CBD oil balm but it didn't do anything for me
2568 2018-09-17 18:34:21 334
2569 2018-09-17 18:34:15 I am going to lift this vehicle up if nobody buys it because I don't want to jack it up to change the oil.
2570 2018-09-17 18:34:08 I don’t get it, cause I know he’s got an amazing rep with people who know him well, but yeah he’s said some head scratchers especially about the Oil which seem to be more pot stirring than anything else
2571 2018-09-17 18:33:40 or do the @chrissyteigen method- peel it, cube it, and cook it for 15-20 min over medium high heat in a FULL CUP of olive oil w lots of salt, pepper, and chile flakes! mind blowingly good
2572 2018-09-17 18:33:30 An alternative version might be:-

Dear loyal customer, we will be hiking your charges.
We have long procrastinated the choice of fuel for 2020 compliance but have decided upon low sulphur fuel oil. This will be eye wateringly expensive for Maersk & yourselves.

2582 2018-09-17 18:31:42 You can google palm oil plantations. They are overtaking the Amazon & other areas. Orangutans & other endangered animals are losing their homes to this cheap oil in most processed foods. Its thoroughly disgusting.
2583 2018-09-17 18:31:39 Thanks Kim, I just dice them up in chunks drizzle some olive oil baked at 410 for about 15 minutes season them with some Lowery's seasoning and at the end shredded parmesan cheese it's really good in a salad or by itself

2587 2018-09-17 18:30:50 you mean CBD oil right? ... because you smoke marijuana not vape it
2588 2018-09-17 18:30:49 I’ve been drinking peppermint tea which has helped, gunna try the black seed oil for sure. Thanks sis! 
2589 2018-09-17 18:30:47 Yep! Just needed the oil change and a new air filter! Yay!

2593 2018-09-17 18:30:21 I take it in the straight oil form. It's really works. It's completely legal! I been having problems with my left hand punching the bag. Started it and over 3 weeks the pain near stopped. They are even trialing it on the NHS for arthritic patients.

2597 2018-09-17 18:29:56 Didn’t say anything about oil or the racial makeup of the military
2598 2018-09-17 18:29:33 Yes, we actually should. But regardless of the climate, we should get away from fossile fuels. Even the most conservative oil-idiot out there knows, that oil isn't infinite. We need it for gas, plastic, fertilisers, etc. So don't burn it.
2599 2018-09-17 18:29:15 I've done my research and know this is one of the largest oil and gas deposits in north America. I'm a shareholder. Know the flow rates of what was drilled and this is the highest risk/ reward ratios available. Legault wins and this is a x100 bagger. Politicians are the only neg.
2600 2018-09-17 18:29:13 It’s almost like Erdogan wants a slice of the Russian oil pipeline action. 
Seems the Clinto/Qatari version is long gone.

2602 2018-09-17 18:29:02 After 4 day’s and 3000 kms driving Sam’s old Mercedes finally has a warning light (oil). There is some justice in the world! @autovista_group
2603 2018-09-17 18:29:01 Not a lot of meat on the bone. How are the other items priced out. 10.97 a gram for oil. Right now from canntrust I pay $90 for 37grams.
2604 2018-09-17 18:28:50 sending you love & peace of mind girl if u haven’t, try cbd oil! it’s helps me chill out when i can’t shake that overall anxious feeling & lavender baths!! hope you find something that works for you

2610 2018-09-17 18:28:29 Ooo Boots should defo have it ..  I found one that uses rosemary?! And vegetable oil .. or ricekrispies and veg oil ..
2611 2018-09-17 18:28:21 Data is the new oil.
2612 2018-09-17 18:28:08 How much have the Norwegians collected in oil revenues since 2014. More than £30 bn, last year £12 bn alone. Perhaps the UK government should apologise for their fiscal incompetence.
2613 2018-09-17 18:28:07 How can water wash away oil.. bro do some research or use commonsense...
2614 2018-09-17 18:27:56 You can make oil, Tea etc instead of smoking.. sucks that’s you can’t smoke anywhere ..

2629 2018-09-17 18:26:00 Geez that took a long time to get done after Morrissey got $6.3 mil over 2 years in Wpg. Oil gives him a shade more at $6.4 mil.
2630 2018-09-17 18:25:51 I used quarter legs! Dillion’s usually has then for the low $3.50! Used olive oil cooking spray, not covered! Soooo easy, inexpensive and yummy
2631 2018-09-17 18:25:50 I need to stock up on Maca Root and Coconut Oil.
2632 2018-09-17 18:25:48 Your assertion that anyone here has made any comments in regards to a person race when legally immigrating. The rate of domestic oil consumption or the racial makeup of the military. On and on and on.
2633 2018-09-17 18:25:26 I learned from the best used car dealers and snake oil salesmen!
2634 2018-09-17 18:25:14 Good grief, if the price of oil was high they'd jump through the 9 circles of hell to get a pipeline through but it is not so just stop with the BS. Also, tell us all again how successful the CPC was with getting pipelines built?
2635 2018-09-17 18:24:42 Congratulations!!! One of the most amazing things I’ve ever seen!!
2636 2018-09-17 18:24:40 More like pasta and olive oil since tomato sauce like Americans do ain't Italian.

The olive oil doubles as a lube for later.
2637 2018-09-17 18:24:33 You should start listening to Rush and Hannity. They back everything up with facts. It's what they do. I work oilfield and with the Obama regulations lifted we are all back working again. Trump did that. Obama tried to kill the coal and the oil and gas industry.

2645 2018-09-17 18:22:57 Same think happened to me. I used 400 plus records to get 30 cards for the honey oil business. And now it shows i only have 26 out of 55 when it should be 56. I got the demos i spent back though which is even weirder. I cant upgrade the business now and won't get the hashcoins.
2646 2018-09-17 18:22:51 Snake oil being sold to fans. Like this saturdays Joshua fight.....
2647 2018-09-17 18:22:35 And I had to cut up lil ones for samples... some soap was glycerin some was olive oil and it was my favorite thing we literally had a cutting board and a set of butchers knives for SOAP NSdkdncm
2648 2018-09-17 18:22:34 We are the worlds largest energy producer so nobody can blame foreign oil  for our almost cheapest in the worlds fuel
2649 2018-09-17 18:22:31 Is this the record that was previously held by Guy Martin?
2650 2018-09-17 18:22:18 I can't believe that Coca-Cola wants to come out with a marijuana oil infused cola. What would their founder think?

(you don't really have to tell me the history, this is sarcasm)
2651 2018-09-17 18:22:12 I was wondering something. How can coconut oil be good for you? Of its 14 grams of fat per serving, 13 is saturated fat.
2652 2018-09-17 18:22:12 Je suis favorable que le gouvernement augmente les taxes sur l'essence et le gas oil
2653 2018-09-17 18:22:04 You mean structuring how every single citizen gets around in almost all contexts to be based on the profits and motives of the oil industry was a bad idea?
2654 2018-09-17 18:21:59 Woman get a car & don’t check the oil, coolant, tire pressure, no nothing. Just start & go 
2655 2018-09-17 18:21:45 Bro... that’s price of crude oil . Let’s assume 25% of buying price as refining cost so it will be 53+13.25=63.25,

2. More 'experience' options/ opportunities for us 'common folks' in the upper bowl
3. Better on ice visuals... oildrops in the center line, LED strips in the glass stanchions for all McDavids goals, bring back the oil derrick
#GoOil!
2664 2018-09-17 18:20:49 Finally getting my oil changed!!!
2665 2018-09-17 18:20:40 Best of luck with the Voltigeurs Olivier! Oil Country is behind you and we can't wait to see you stopping pucks in Oilers silks again.
2666 2018-09-17 18:20:03 vitamin E oil works too!!
2667 2018-09-17 18:19:58 Farming and ranchers, along with oil and gas is strong in this region. And while Dems still have voter advantage in the district, the area has become more conservative over the years.
2668 2018-09-17 18:19:37 Photons are emitted by any body above absolute zero? C-  quantum mechanics oil man.
2669 2018-09-17 18:19:31 Are Westminster going to apologise for 50 years of squandered Scottish Gas and Oil.
What’s Scotlands Oil fund worth after letting Westminster’s broad shoulders carry it?
£0, absolutely nothing...

2671 2018-09-17 18:19:17 Baby oil you all think we didn’t know?
2672 2018-09-17 18:19:13 Not US. Saudiarabia is the largest crude oil producer in the world. 
Now saudi is stop pumping of oil due to OPEC advise. So we cant say US is the largest oil producer.

2673 2018-09-17 18:19:11 Coconut oil works wonders. Base with it
2674 2018-09-17 18:19:06 Once a pore becomes clogged, it traps skin oil inside. Bacteria grows in this oil and can cause an inflammatory response in the skin.

2676 2018-09-17 18:18:57 What makes you think that? He had everything before taking office. Presidents Bush, old and young, were out for personal reasons. Going to war with Iraq was due to family pride. Saddam threatened old man Bush. So young Bush had to step up. Also involved with oil companies.
2677 2018-09-17 18:18:50 Excellent, I'm Camila, I'm 73, and I never fucking learned how to use an oil heater.
2678 2018-09-17 18:18:50 We are self-sufficient. Canada is a net oil exporter. Alberta greatly objected to the earlier attempts to "manage" that sector of the economy. And, no, it doesn't make economic sense to tell refiners who are not part of an integrated supply chain where to get their feedstock.
2679 2018-09-17 18:18:37 Oh good god, you're one of the "we should have a oil fund" which would have taken MORE out of the coffers not added anything to it since independence! Amazing.

2682 2018-09-17 18:17:50 He doesn't want us to see just home much the Trump tax scam benefited him and his family and how staked in oil/gas/chemical industries he is. He makes the top 50 richest MOC lists every year.
2683 2018-09-17 18:17:46 Grow up asshole. This is one Exceptionally Fucked up Man. And he is to Stupid to understand his Brain is running on 3 Cylinders and those 3 Are leaking Oil like no one has ever Seen. Soon his 3 will lock up  Sad human being  SAD!

2688 2018-09-17 18:17:36 @HillaryClinton You need to teach her while you are still here to be a strong frugal independent if needed strong person in case the world turns to Nuclear War because the people who spread the lie it is Russia because they own their own money and oil who own our money and oil
2689 2018-09-17 18:17:32 What environmental controls. Unlimited oil sands production?
2690 2018-09-17 18:17:31 I have attended meetings with the RSPO and WWF and their advice is to use responsibly sourced palm oil as if everyone moves away from palm it would cause major environmental issues and RSPO palm is from well managed farms.
2691 2018-09-17 18:17:28 We are a nation of consumers. The GOP, and Trump, NEEDS us to be consumers, The rest of the world doesn't need America. America doesn't carry anyone. We step in to protect our interests. We want Mercedes and diamonds and pate' and silk and oil and caviar and electronics.
2692 2018-09-17 18:17:15 ha. do you think china and india are going to get penalized by the U.S. for importing Iranian oil? or do you think there's going to be an exception for both?
2693 2018-09-17 18:17:10 I’m getting my oil change during work hours lol. I love me 
2694 2018-09-17 18:17:01 "Your hair looks super soft" thx dude i use two seperate conditioners, argan oil, gentle hold gel, and some very judiciously applied aquanet every morning it had fucking well better look soft

2696 2018-09-17 18:16:57 @marinamaral2 with apologies to my own mother with her oil paints brought large format b/w to color life...  marina is best at it plus involved in history
2697 2018-09-17 18:16:45 The contouring make up that doesn’t match any skin on their body, the lips that look like they’ve been pumped and not natural. I’m no oil painting as a mid 40’s fat woman but at least I’m me-warts and all!!
2698 2018-09-17 18:16:39 Tax the rich and corporations. Don't give money to oil and insurance companies and it is easily paid for.
2699 2018-09-17 18:16:37 Doesn't look like Petrol, may be it's lubricating oil...
2700 2018-09-17 18:16:30 He didn’t compare economy or politics....just the price per barrel of oil....it’s a legit concern since they also have heavy oil. And the light sweet crude discount is especially alarming as it is virtually the same oil as you see the US getting well over $60 per barrel.
2701 2018-09-17 18:16:24 Emergency plumber out as the oil tank is still leaking #oilfumes #Northumberland #kevincoeplumber #seriously #whataheadache
2702 2018-09-17 18:15:54 Without profits from gasoline... the price of oil will essentially collapse along with their power
2703 2018-09-17 18:15:46 So on top of me not having ANY power steering fluid in my car, I also have NO oil loolllll.
2704 2018-09-17 18:15:40 Nope. The majority of the análisis focus on Maduro’s government, since 2014, coinciding with oil prices fell. So people is like “oh is because Maduro and because oil prices”. If you don’t show the record from before Chavez...nothing explains by itself

2708 2018-09-17 18:15:14 In the past week or so:
- A Catholic crusader used "ableism" to attack abortion
- Oil industry astroturfers used Resistance hysteria to attack anti-fracking petitioners as tools of Putin
- An obvious weight loss/MLM scam presented as a self-love confessional went massively viral
2709 2018-09-17 18:15:13 Bro, don't believe on this figure, India's total oil consumption is 42 Lakh barrels, 1barrel=159Ltr, in Ltrs its 67 thousand crore ltr per day approx India consumes the diesel/petrol every day.
2710 2018-09-17 18:15:12 Laundry is half way done, got a well needed oil change.

2717 2018-09-17 18:14:20 Washed my car, oil change done, gym done. I love getting everything done early. 
2718 2018-09-17 18:14:18 È certo che sapesse esprimersi per iscritto in latino, greco, lingua d'oil e arabo.
2719 2018-09-17 18:13:56 All in the name of "jobs". At least that's what they tell us. Total lie though. This is about protecting the wealthy's quarterly dividend cheque. The best way to end oil's power is to convince enough people to switch to electric vehicles
2720 2018-09-17 18:13:47 Take plenty Vit C and eat garlic. ASAP smother yourself in 8 drops tea tree essential oil diluted in an egg cup of oil, not baby oil. You will sweat/shiver but cold will not take hold. Good luck 
2721 2018-09-17 18:13:44 Apply lots of clove oil/ or guava leaves paste/ have a Combiflam and google up a dentist first thing in the morning.

2727 2018-09-17 18:13:08 I don't wish assault on anyone, and I don't applaud snake oil salesmen who ineptly try to discredit those who come forward about it either, excusing "oh shit! I got caught;" with some form of imaginary journalistic integrity. Have fun with that balloon, though.

2733 2018-09-17 18:12:43 Indeed Snoutintrough with you on that one - will tell Mr EE  to oil up the rack and the metal pincers #FBPE
2734 2018-09-17 18:12:33 Primer is key! A good oil controlling primer will work wonders - the Becca one is really good. Another trick is after using primer, set it with some powder. It helps control the oil and keeps you matte longer
2735 2018-09-17 18:12:29 Get out here with the polygraph crap ... it’s not reliable and there as many hucksters in the business as there were snake oil salesmen in the 1800’s.  As for the therapist notes, they are inconsistent with her public statements and don’t name Kavanaugh.

If it wasn't for Arabian oil, great depression otherwise was making westerners sell their children out of hunger.
2753 2018-09-17 18:10:41 Oh nice! Happy for ya!

2763 2018-09-17 18:09:47 @Kashifabbasiary saw your show today... valid point on gas price increase.

Also, they did reduce LNG prices.... we should also give credit where it is due

2768 2018-09-17 18:09:09 In family life, love is the oil that eases friction, the cement that binds closer together, and the music that brings harmony.

2780 2018-09-17 18:07:47 Are you serious? Got a reference for me? I love you. The eucalyptus oil is crap in comparison xxxx
2781 2018-09-17 18:07:25 We need to ditch oil completely as far as it’s use in transport is concerned. Electric and bio fuel cars only. GOI should create the infrastructure - charging stn. in every gas station. Mechanism to convert petrol/diesel vehicles into electric.
2782 2018-09-17 18:07:00 I do have one question can I use my normal charcoal facemask before I use the products and my clean and clear oil free face wash after I use the product and the products will still do what there designed to do?  xx
2783 2018-09-17 18:06:59 First a jar falls on my head and now I had hot oil splash in my eye, whoever has my voodoo doll quit that shit I ain’t tryna die before I graduate
2784 2018-09-17 18:06:55 @realDonaldTrump AS WE IN THE FUTURE APROACH AN ICE AGE, I feel sorry for us if all we have is solar mostly. We will definitely need oil during that time I think???
2785 2018-09-17 18:06:46 non ca fait plusieurs mois que je l'utilise, et le oil control est impecc, y a aucune sensation de secheresse apres, contrairement a bcp de nettoyants mousse !
2786 2018-09-17 18:06:35 The Patriot conducted two ship-to-ship oil transfers for North Korea in early 2018, moving 1,500 tons to North Korea-flagged Chong Rim 2 and 2,000 tons to Chon Ma San.
The oil buyer was North Korean company Taesong Bank, which is also subject to US and UN sanctions.
2787 2018-09-17 18:06:20 the coconut is just flour and oil
2788 2018-09-17 18:06:17 From the confessed limited amount of information available - it seems clear that Saudi Arabia funded/sponsored the 9/11 attack - I cannot image why we are still buying any oil from them - or transacting business with them - they are mass murderers of Americans
2789 2018-09-17 18:06:17 Sometimes, I question why I don't have more white clothing in my teaching wardrobe, and then I spend my day getting oil, grease, and dirt on everything and I quickly remember why.

2791 2018-09-17 18:05:55 What the actual giddy fuck is "alkaline water"? I smell snake oil ...
2792 2018-09-17 18:05:55 I went to the supermarket today. ALL of the snacks I saw contained palm oil. I have lost faith in humanity.
2793 2018-09-17 18:05:43 I like how Lavender oil helps just a common headache as well.
2794 2018-09-17 18:05:38 Think of an unsweetened scone. White gravy: like a French  roux made with flour, milk, a little oil (usually bacon drippings), salt, pepper and meat (usually sausage). The gravy is poured over the biscuit. It’s very good and eaten for breakfast mostly in the Southern USA.
2795 2018-09-17 18:05:38 i want to make paintings of female nudes!!! i gotta get to model night and start doing more still lives of florals and shit for backdrops, yes im aware that florals are the fashionable backdrop du jour but like...i also want to partially become a oil portraitist and like. u kno.
2796 2018-09-17 18:05:33 @InklessPW Tonight. Paull Wells with Justin Trudeau. My question:
Justin Trudeau bought a $4.5 Billions on this current pipeline evaluated at $500 millions. We now own it and we are responsible to have the rest of it built on our dime. Asia decides not to buy our oil..???
2797 2018-09-17 18:05:14 U better be nice w me iP paper, I'm burning the midnight oil for yaa
2798 2018-09-17 18:05:11 Ponds oil control is good, except if you’ve tried it and it didn’t work.
2799 2018-09-17 18:05:07 These ships still use bunker oil. Basically what's left after refining crude. And the captains aren't too troubled to wash their their tanks in mid ocean.
2800 2018-09-17 18:04:33 However, with oil flowing ever more thickly, things got better eventually, with then secretary of state Condoleezza Rice describing Obiang as “a good friend”.

2802 2018-09-17 18:04:13 The face of someone who repeats the oil / coal industry's false line.  She knows better; she just isn't allowed to speak what she knows to be true.  The face of someone bought and paid for by oil and coal.

2808 2018-09-17 18:03:42 Qatar to produce electric vehicles by 2023, yet our @NGRPresident is minister for petroleum. Very soon Nigeria go drink crude oil
2809 2018-09-17 18:03:33 No. Despite the undermining of Venezuela by the US - its foreign policy for decades. They are a single-source economy [oil], which is an easy vector to undermine, so we'd better look out post-#brexitshambles if we only export 'services'. #ugh #ToriesOut #bbcaq #bbcqt

2811 2018-09-17 18:03:30 I honestly believe that you simply haven’t been lucky enough to enjoy a great pizza. Really, your rejection of pizza is unnatural... some fluffy dough, some spicy tomato sauce and buffalo mozzarella. For the finish some olive oil after baking - heaven!  
2812 2018-09-17 18:03:18 I always believed that Nail and Chuck were ruined by being rushed into NHL service by the bad teams that drafted them. What a difference a Memorial Cup run in Sarnia might have made for them, the Oil and the Habs.
2813 2018-09-17 18:03:14 We aren’t even smart enough to buy our own oil!
2814 2018-09-17 18:02:59 What is this animal afraid of? The parasitic nature of the North is making him jittery. No more oil wells for them . Thieves
2815 2018-09-17 18:02:58 So I actually had to wait a few minutes for my @ChickfilA food at the drive thru which I didn’t mind at all. While I waited tho the workers ended up changing my oil and rotating my tires. #alwaysaboveandbeyond
2816 2018-09-17 18:02:41 I don’t have enough knowledge of the oil markets to understand the supply dynamic, so always keen on asking smart people of their views.
2817 2018-09-17 18:02:34 Yeah, just get the area moisturised (tissue oil and lotions for very dry skin)
2818 2018-09-17 18:02:34 Oil spill on the road past the Plough in #Coton I know most of you won't know where Coton is but if this helps a (motor)-cyclist stay upright on their way home then it's worth it. Did a proper wheel slide on it myself. Please RT @camcycle @BBCCambs
2819 2018-09-17 18:02:31 I need someone to change my oil. Would you be so kind? It goes in through here... *spreads legs*
2820 2018-09-17 18:02:27 So it does take a little while to kick in or regulate in your system?? I’m trying to see if my CBD oil will help with my depression/anxiety/irritability, and I haven’t noticed a huge difference. But I’ve only been taking it for a week or so.
2821 2018-09-17 18:02:19 how easy it is to cook vegetables baked in just a few with Picsweet Farm in just a few minutes with a little oil and salt we get delicious vegetables with the roasted flavor
2822 2018-09-17 18:02:15 Hmmm, do I believe the person who is working to salvage the environment, or Jackie Stewart, who is paid to maximize profits for the oil and gas industry as Managing Director of @FTIConsulting?
2823 2018-09-17 18:02:14 iluto sa boiling water with oil, tan. hehe. ang water and oil kay enough lang na mabasa ang hotdog pero dili sya mauga sa lutuanan. dili masunog imong hotdog :)
2824 2018-09-17 18:02:10 i think some people literally turn their brains off while they take notes. the person next to me literally wrote “eating too much oil is bad for your health” (i’m in a foods class)
2825 2018-09-17 18:02:10 Devil in Toronto ?! Am I missing something? Is this a new take on the lockness monster as a way to improve the economy over there ? 
Religion and politics mixing is like oil and water ? I think I'll keep to my atheist views !!!

2827 2018-09-17 18:01:59 Lol nah bro, the UK don't really have that much exports. What does UK make that the world can't do without? Maybe oil in Scotland but even Scotland doesn't want to be apart of Britain anymore
2828 2018-09-17 18:01:59 At first prepare this suspension : 4tb spn Aloe Vera gel(fresh extract), 3+3tb spn Lemon juice & ginger juice, 2 tb spn EV Olive oil. Mix all in mixer & store in fridge. Take 1T spn twice 15 min before meals(not BF). The supplement would be taken before BF. I think start it first
2829 2018-09-17 18:01:58 My purse is a wallet made of duck tape, my lipstick is melted crayons & coconut oil, my favorite jewelry- handmade. All gifts from my kid, which I wear proudly when I go out.

Their economic outputs are probably the defining factor , and of course the lack of fecking oil.

2853 2018-09-17 17:59:21 Try a few drops of olive oil on a cotton ball.
2854 2018-09-17 17:59:18 How about Japan, Germany, South Korea, Poland, Estonia, Latvia and other countries with so called "wester influence"? Ukraine = Russia without oil and gas in terms of economy. Russia is governed by fsb-mafia-oligarchy who is robbing russian people and brainwash them.
2855 2018-09-17 17:59:17 they could also run on whale oil. plug them in the wall. you know
2856 2018-09-17 17:59:14 How the hell do they go that fast?!...
2857 2018-09-17 17:59:03 Its obvious that reducing taxes on petrol/diesel will affect fiscal deficit in a large way. But isnt that means that current govt economy growth is mainly due to fall in crude oil prices which gave option of increasing tax by more than 400% and no actual development @arunjaitley
2858 2018-09-17 17:59:02 I guess my temp was too high to give blood today so now I’m killing time at panera before my oil change at 3.
2859 2018-09-17 17:58:45 This land is my land, this land is your land....maybe we should pockets the proceeds, like how Alaska pays its citizens from an oil fund?  #giveitback
2860 2018-09-17 17:58:38 It should be at Popular Mechanics in an hour or less? Interesting stuff, I learned about hot tapping pressurized oil and fuel.
2861 2018-09-17 17:58:33 Hrm, granola from last night turned out to be not so great. Didn't taste much like pumpkin, not much spice to it, and I'm pretty sure the recipe called for waaaayy too much oil.
2862 2018-09-17 17:58:33 never heard of a hiccough only a hiccup.

2888 2018-09-17 17:55:17 I'd do anything to help with the oil
2889 2018-09-17 17:55:11 Cut into small cubes and roast with dried chilli flakes, sprinkle of salt and a little oil. Forms the basis of lots of other dishes then...
2890 2018-09-17 17:54:43 You know, there's nothing wrong w/#ChuckGrassley that a little neatsfoot oil couldn't cure.
2891 2018-09-17 17:54:35 Yeah, I actually just wrote about it. We're draining it of oil right now. Estimated 250-750k gallons still inside hull, USNS Salvor is working on it.
2892 2018-09-17 17:54:01 I just refilled my essential oil blend for tension as if I could anticipate the blundering emotional mess I'd be today.
2893 2018-09-17 17:53:55 You can avoid it. Olive oil and butter are my staple good fats. Avoid the processed oils like rapeseed, vegetable etc.

2898 2018-09-17 17:53:01 We are oil and water. Both are liquids! They can even look clear! But water will never be oil.

If we use enough force, we can make a colloid like mayo. We won't make the oil transform it's nature.

2939 2018-09-17 17:47:20 That represents about all the people actually working in the oil fields. The industry likes to quote a figure off more than 200,000, which includes everyone working in a gas station or 7-11 with pumps. So a good portion of lower figure could be at risk
2940 2018-09-17 17:47:18 AHHHH!  A MAN!

Where did the nice glasses lady go?  And this one smelled like oil, too!  Yuck!

Now he's hiding in a corner.
2941 2018-09-17 17:47:13 Even though I also think that they should be capable of bleeding. At least some kind of oil like sustance, they don't. They shouldn't even able to feel, they only have simulated personalities.
2942 2018-09-17 17:46:57 Great to see oil free postage stamps being designed.
2943 2018-09-17 17:46:55 I had the shea moisture hair butter that was of Jamaican black castor oil. That shit smelled horrible.
2944 2018-09-17 17:46:36 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...

2947 2018-09-17 17:46:27 what are the cannabis to coconut/sunflower/grapeseed oil ratios?
2948 2018-09-17 17:46:26 Don’t go to Walmart period go in there needing an oil change leave out needing a whole new engine.
2949 2018-09-17 17:46:23 I figured you had plenty of that 525 oil in there....
2950 2018-09-17 17:46:12 8 remaining

2952 2018-09-17 17:46:00 nooooooooooooooooooooooooo D: drinks lots of water, find someone with lavender oil or somethin!
2953 2018-09-17 17:45:36 Definitely not the oil industry. Just a concerned mum who likes to see consultation behind Government decisions. I walk to work but I still appreciate that the demand for oil is there. Hope you are not using anything made from oil today to help conserve for the rest of us.

2955 2018-09-17 17:45:15 I need an oil change
2956 2018-09-17 17:44:56 I think if we all adopt your path we won't have this issue. Parents play a huge part in making us feel secure & confident in our bodies. As great as my mom is, she encouraged us to use bio oil for stretch marks from like 12 yrs 
2957 2018-09-17 17:44:44 This bitch really gonna make me wait till this damn oil change is done, she irks me with this bullshit
2958 2018-09-17 17:44:37 Am not even following playoff. Though power is leading JKL 2 up and City oil/KIU is tied at 1 a piece. Might watch finals.
2959 2018-09-17 17:44:18 Eataly has more than just coffee. They've got a gelato bar, fresh made Italian dishes, and various Italian foods imported. You would be hard pressed to find fresher and higher quality olive oil.
2960 2018-09-17 17:44:09 Heavy Canadian crude, referred to as Western Canadian Select is benchmarked by Canadian oil producers, but cannot reach new customers because the existing pipelines and railcars are at capacity. A pipeline is the safest and most efficient way to get AB oil to market.
2961 2018-09-17 17:43:58 Birds covered with oil, pipeline leaks or explosions, even environmental damage from extraction… not so much. They all pale in comparison to the fundamental changes that will happen to the ecosystem in which we live and our ability to function within it.
2962 2018-09-17 17:43:31 @AngelCorrea32 Walk at least with 1 crutch inside until the leaking is gone, that should be within a week, better with 2 and keep the knee strait, put tissues & a spoon in a backpack, a shower-chair, a bottle of water with sea salt, scissors, tape, the oil, a pen, notebook,

2966 2018-09-17 17:42:49 Productivity is not valued in Nigeria. Oil revenue is enough.

2969 2018-09-17 17:42:32 Do you realize you are comparing services to commodities(things)? Do you understand that automation & technological advances usually will lead to the lowering of cost. Look at the oil industry. What did you learn in college?
2970 2018-09-17 17:42:26 #Inflation goes high by day to day so it doesn't mean bcz of #BJP , it goes high because of you've waste & you're wasting a lot of fuels, electricity, oil and gases without any reason. "Use those things only when you needed otherwise it costs more" @PMOIndia @narendramodi #india
2971 2018-09-17 17:42:13 You need to put your thinking cap on and make the connections. Don’t blame you for not doing this before. So much obfuscation from The  Company owned media. With the knowledge that we’ve reached peak oil production some while back you should be able to join the dots.
2972 2018-09-17 17:42:08 Modi hs already given clean chit to UPA that no corruption that time.

2013-14:Centre had got 2.53 lac Cr tax on Petroleum Product.
Now center getting 11 lac
Cr, deduct 1.3 lac crore Oil bond, still it is 9.7 lac CR(3 times of UPA).

Why center is not reducing tax ?

2975 2018-09-17 17:41:34 i have low porosity hair so i do my hot oil treatments&deep conditioning treatments for hours instead of thirty minutes because it’ll still be stuck on the surface of my hair after only thirty minutes. I also finger detangle my hair by section and twist it in between treatments
2976 2018-09-17 17:41:33 She goes where the U.S. Big Oil Money pays her to protest but in this case a Teachers Association will pay her to help them indoctrinate our youth. Suzuki got an honourary degree. Alberta is headed to full on anarchy to stop this. We’ve had enough.
2977 2018-09-17 17:41:32 Barn cats are tough as fuck.
2978 2018-09-17 17:41:32 Ironic that you think it's not ok for the uk to use the oil but perfectly fine for Edinburgh to claim Shetlands oil as its own
2979 2018-09-17 17:41:26 We fucked it up with Excise Duty..Nothing wrong with crude oil !
2980 2018-09-17 17:41:26 Proverbs 5:3-4 “For the lips of an immoral woman are as sweet as honey, and her mouth is smoother than oil. But in the end she is as bitter as poison, as dangerous as a double-edged sword.”

2983 2018-09-17 17:41:03 Trump's a wild man, but fortunately he isn't good at being evil like Bush Jr. it's just easier to tell he's a bit touched.

Bush sent hundreds of thousands in to a war for oil, and destabilized an entire area. Trump tweets a lot of crazy stuff and signs whatever Repubs want.

2988 2018-09-17 17:40:23 Mine too  I actually started making my own facial products with essential oils and vitamin e oil and rosehip, and my skin has never looked better, cutting chemicals out of your regime does wonders! Natural beauty is the best!

2993 2018-09-17 17:40:06 sept 11th was nothing more than a stepping stone for lying bush/cheney to expand their WMB excuse they perpetrated to attack Iraq for oil! Cheney's Halibuton made 39.5 Billion dollars without any bidding for contracts, - yet NO investigations!
2994 2018-09-17 17:40:03 What about NAFTA and the thousands of jobs that you have destroyed in our oil industry? What about our border with the burden you are causing us with the cost of housing ILLEGALS? When are you actually going to do things that benefit Canada and Canadians?
2995 2018-09-17 17:39:59 - New record highs for small-business confidence and job openings.
- Food stamp usage declines for eight straight months. 
- S&P 500 & NASDAQ reach record highs as earnings eclipse trade war fears.
- The USA is rapidly becoming the world's biggest oil producer.
2996 2018-09-17 17:39:50 India has just completed a modern refinery at tidewater which has capacity to refine 67% of all of Canadian heavy crude. And the preferred feedstock is premium heavy crude which is exactly what Canadian oil producers sell. 

You're trip is great timing Jason!

3000 2018-09-17 17:39:00 Ha! Good question. I didn't think to ask so I looked it up and found this "Peppermint oil is one of the most versatile essential oils out there. It can be used aromatically, topically and internally to address a number of health concerns. I think Id try topical first but thats me

3005 2018-09-17 17:37:41 Lots and lots of aloe!!  Keep your skin clean, less face makeup if you wear it, and drink lots of water. 
When it heals, you can use a rosehip facial oil or a Vitamin C serum to help even out any discoloration! I hope this helps :)
3006 2018-09-17 17:37:40 My thread could be snake oil for all you know, but it’s not going to harm you if you try it. And writing is therapeutic, anyway.
3007 2018-09-17 17:37:39 There are different sorts, metabolised different ways. NSAIDS are renal metabolised so I'm banned from them. There are options other than opiate based, CBD oil can work too (not in renal failure!) I use cryotherapy gel (alcohol based) applied topically.
3008 2018-09-17 17:37:35 I highly doubt anybody is doing a premium oil change for $20 lol
3009 2018-09-17 17:37:35 Josh, pick me along the way. I got a few poor management case studies, some olive oil, a six-pack of Shiner, and some $2.99 knock-off sunglasses I can add to the fray.

3020 2018-09-17 17:36:41 I like coconut oil as a leave in treatment. Especially for the ends. You can put it in your hair over night and wash it out in the morning. It’s fantastic. Also a hair serum called bumble bee is great.
3021 2018-09-17 17:36:35 my morning started off with me knocking over a full glass of water all over my bed, makeup, clothes, oil lmao
3022 2018-09-17 17:36:26 What's the value of cotton to you. Sudan is unable to state that for it's own commodity So - oil up, cotton up but revenue down, outlook up, input cost are up with growth over the last 5 years. Why? it's called market sentiment to paint negitives without facts (economic warfare)
3023 2018-09-17 17:36:23 A lil Shea butter or coconut oil to rub on it after leaving the shower never hurt nobody. Hun you gotta treat your booty better than that.
3024 2018-09-17 17:36:21 That's actually supposed to reduce oil production in your hair. She looks good *because* she hasn't washed her hair in a week. I just don't have the fortitude to make the switch. lol
3025 2018-09-17 17:36:20 Socialist?  That word has little meaning after big bank, big oil, and big auto bailouts and other corporate welfare handouts.   In fact, it's almost been a century since nationalists and socialists merged to form the NSDAP.
3026 2018-09-17 17:36:13 So why didn’t you show leadership on the morning of the referendum result, even celebrated, instead of running scared. Was it because you knew how difficult it was, what BS was sold. Easiest deal in history. £350 million for NHS. Enough of your snake oil.

3034 2018-09-17 17:35:05 The tenor in which it’s talked about gives it to much credence especially in its infantile stages.  

I’ve seen this through the history of football we’re too ready to get the “anointing oil” and start prepping Busts for Canton for early success and Condemn others for struggles

3069 2018-09-17 17:32:05 This whole pipeline issue has zero to do with the environment.
It's the big players that want to control the market, they don't mind if our oil makes it to the world market as long as it doesn't make it there directly from Canada.
3070 2018-09-17 17:32:05 That’s why you have to get dirty and trick people into paying you by sending out official looking documents making them think they legally have to pay you.....huh ??? You are the scum of the earth, carpet bagging blow hard snake oil salesman

3072 2018-09-17 17:31:57 I need to ask Mechanical Engineers this question. 
Are mechanical parts time dependent for wear and tear if they based on utilisation?
I would have thought that change of oil is sufficient than replacing parts.  I think I am being taken for a ride by the garage.

3075 2018-09-17 17:31:50 #MATD 7am RNS tomorrow morning? 5 more fully funded drills to go....Winter coming in #Mongolia so surely they'd have plugged it by now and moved if a duster? Wishful thinking maybe, let's see... #AIM could do with a big Oil find, help liquidity 
3076 2018-09-17 17:31:47 every time i use an oil blotting sheet my feelings get hurt smh
3077 2018-09-17 17:31:38 Add a jacket potato done in the oven Alastair? We have fish and a jacket spud all the time,  especially nice if you cover the potato skin in olive oil and sea salt and of course pricking with a fork! Ooer Missus!  Enjoy 
3078 2018-09-17 17:31:36 The stuff I use now has .0% THC to 300 mG of CBD. According to federal law, CBD can have trace amounts of THC (.3%) to be considered hemp(CBD) oil. Yes, the mints I usED was a 20:1.    
not trying to get into an argument, just trying to get people to research on their own.
3079 2018-09-17 17:31:32 What global companies?! No one interested in iraq as long as its corrupt and unstable. Cant wait for govt? Who exactly us we?! Nothing will good will happen as long as pol parties capture oil rich state institutions. Iraq does not have a thing called private sector
3080 2018-09-17 17:31:09 Am gonna try taking coconut oil soon :). Have been taking flaxseed powder and chia seeds on and off since few years :)

3083 2018-09-17 17:30:47 Giving full body oil messages are so fun tbh
3084 2018-09-17 17:30:43 Ahaha unionists eh like to blame the SNPzz about shortfall in oil receipts when its WM that guzzles the profits, other countries laugh at this as they know the UK Westminster govt is at it. Was it not Malta they said would never survive Independently of the UK, i rest my case.

3086 2018-09-17 17:30:24 .@norwex body cloth is what I use every day  and it changed my life! I hate oil in/near my eyes. I wear contacts, super sensitive. And these wipe eye make up and all make up right off.

Add some lemon, tom paste, flake, salt, wine, cook another min, mix, add pasta. Maybe £1.5/person
3090 2018-09-17 17:30:05 Sure Untill 2040 , Oil domination can't be ruled out
3091 2018-09-17 17:30:04 Of course you could just mix it yourself using Blackcurrant essential oil.... probably need some experimenting to get the other notes right
3092 2018-09-17 17:29:29 We know that an iScotland from 2014 would have been in deep financial trouble. There's that £30 billion of oil revenue missing and the likelihood that the IMF would have had to be called in.
3093 2018-09-17 17:29:25 Does OPEC even has 1m bpd of spare capacity to pump more oil ? And why are they bringing this up ? Are they scared of some kind of shortage later in the year ?
3094 2018-09-17 17:29:19 or at least mention "Mom's Homemade Squirrel Oil"
3095 2018-09-17 17:29:11 Cut into big chunks, roast with olive oil, garlic and red onions (quartered). Serve at room temp with a sauce made of tahini, garlic and lemon juice.
3096 2018-09-17 17:29:01 Why are business companies such as Google,  Microsoft,  Facebook among many and oil companies as well as the farmers union are wanting you to stop these tariffs. Everyone is hurting.

3100 2018-09-17 17:28:43 @SuperValuIRL @bordbia nearly all biscuits/crackers in Supervalu are baked with Palm oil which is most unhealthy. I wonder could you pressure your suppliers to change this?
3101 2018-09-17 17:28:41 Kenapa nutox cleansing oil ni tak macam oil?dia macam kesat sikit tak macam HL punya cleansing oil

3103 2018-09-17 17:28:36 There's nothing more disappointing than someone you respected going all-in on YL oil BS
3104 2018-09-17 17:28:35 Bruuuhhhh! I was at NTB and had an appointment to get an oil change. I was gonna get my inspection done too, but their machine was down. So now I’m at this other spot where there’s one dude working and it’s taking forever
3105 2018-09-17 17:28:34 Sounds like start of JAMES Bond movie plot. Next they team up with China and a Middle East cartel to spike the oil market (having stockpiles themselves) and send the despot west into global recession before flogging gold to buy up cheap western companies.
3106 2018-09-17 17:28:31 I definitely could!! There are also some alternatives in the supermarket that don’t contain palm oil that I’ve switched to now!!
3107 2018-09-17 17:28:27 Whisk egg yolk with a tablespoon of olive oil and leave on hair for a few minutes before your shampoo. It makes a great hair conditioner.
3108 2018-09-17 17:28:17 Grill it!  Little olive oil, high heat for a couple minutes on each side. Salt. Pepper. Feta or Tajiin! It’s wild.
3109 2018-09-17 17:28:02 Cleaning my car out and letting it sit til I’m ready to go get an oil change & doing homework for the rest of the day 
3110 2018-09-17 17:28:02 Why do they always work on a oil rig or retired military too and they all call you dear and then of course they DM I have male friends on here that do it occasionally but not as soon as they follow you

3113 2018-09-17 17:27:58 My husbands made his pizza. Makes his own crust( rivals Mozza’s)with olive oil, fennel pollen, fontina, parm, heirloom tomatoes, fresh basil. So yummy!
3114 2018-09-17 17:27:46 It’s easy for a male to find a great paying job. Y’all can weld, go to the oil field, and much more that pay well. For women it’s different. You have to have a degree if you want to make good money. 
3115 2018-09-17 17:27:41 Gotta wait a mf hour to get a oil change 
3116 2018-09-17 17:27:41 I'm from Gadsden, Al.. I'll only defend Moore on those allegations, however Moore has always been a snake oil salesmen and a garbage judge
3117 2018-09-17 17:27:32 So far my car's needed service is the oil change and an air filter change I figure it needed. Feeling ok about it.
3118 2018-09-17 17:27:27 India's export industry is adversely affected by implementation of DeMo and GST. Most of then loses there working capital due to not getting tax credit and tax refund. That's why this time CAD is start  imbalanceing when oil price not as much high as it was before 2014.
3119 2018-09-17 17:27:17 The guy changing my oil just asked me if my car was a beetle, not sure if i should be concerned about if he knows what he’s doing or not 
3120 2018-09-17 17:27:13 Premier Notley...You bring zero value to Alberta. You have allowed Trudeau to destroy our once proud Oil industry. Keep tweeting....

3123 2018-09-17 17:26:59 Try rubbing the tape with oil when you want to take it off (Baby oil, coconut oil, olive oil, etc.)
3124 2018-09-17 17:26:55 Hey!!! No filter on this one. Just Oil of Ulay

3128 2018-09-17 17:26:41 Nutella was originally invented to cope with post WW2 food shortages in Italy & I'm sure they didn't use palm oil then. Why not make it yourself with sugar, nuts & a little cocoa?
3129 2018-09-17 17:26:38 Am so proud of you oluwatobi.  May God continue to encompasses you with wisdom, knowledge and understanding. Above all, I anoint you with oil of greatness.
3130 2018-09-17 17:26:24 Anyone on my TL every tried oil pulling?
3131 2018-09-17 17:26:06 habitat destruction from palm oil plantations, do some fuckin research lol
3132 2018-09-17 17:25:58 I want to start oil pulling before I go to my dentist appointment
3133 2018-09-17 17:25:56 In Zambia Lands were stolen to little farmers to produce Palm Oil for....Europe !!!
3134 2018-09-17 17:25:56 @LBC #FarageOnLBC We KNEW voting for Brexit would mean the status quo would leave,  their snake oil salesmen, this intervention is just about keeping the UK money propping up  the failing EU and I just don’t care anymore not one iota – Chris Edmund
3135 2018-09-17 17:25:43 That will mop up the oil spill nicely though
3136 2018-09-17 17:25:38 Why is Nigeria Giants of Africa, population or the GDP that's 90% oil
3137 2018-09-17 17:25:34 Sa panahon kasi ngayon, COCONUT OIL na lang ang virgin. TANGHALI na lang ang tapat. BILIHIN na lang ang nagmamahal. PIMPLES na lang ang hindi nang-iiwan. IHI na lang ang nagpapakilig. Ang TRUST naman, naging condom na. At isa pa, You find true love in, SAN MARINO TUNA.
3138 2018-09-17 17:25:15 you right us gays don’t know how to change oil
3139 2018-09-17 17:25:03 me: do your homework
also me: go buy a panel and paint something COMPLETELY unrelated even though u have good oil paper adn also shouldnt be oil painting rn
3140 2018-09-17 17:25:02 It’s a shame tax payers pay your salary and soon to be very expensive pension. Meanwhile you hurt thousands of families trying to make an honest living in our once proud Oil industry.

3143 2018-09-17 17:24:55 OMG I know about anointing with oil, Becky. You're just claiming it was cannabis oil  not even your Wikipedia article is goofy enough to make that claim
3144 2018-09-17 17:24:53 Both the ActiFry and the Air Fryer work with heat, just in different ways. Both require little oil, I used 1 tablespoon of olive oil on my potatoes and about the same for the chicken which may not have needed it.
3145 2018-09-17 17:24:52 *places chili in olive oil* ah food science
3146 2018-09-17 17:24:51 And tea tree oil as a natural antiseptic! Maim, but don’t infect the wound. That’s just bad manners.
3147 2018-09-17 17:24:45 This “warning” is all about trying UK in the EU for OUR money, that’s what it is not concern for us 
Le Guard and the rest of the “experts” are snake oil salesmen, I’m so sick to the back teeth of them I need dentures! – Chris Edmund
3148 2018-09-17 17:24:45 38 yrs ago a boss in the geophysical company I worked in masturbated in front of me while asking me to touch him.

He also paid young female employees to "entertain" vacationing oil field guys. 

We were so young, so gullible, afraid to lose our jobs.

Call me a liar.  I dare you
3149 2018-09-17 17:24:42 Fuckin hot body and delicious ass!!!  I love to oil it for you.   Yum!!
3150 2018-09-17 17:24:42 See you on the circuit buddy. Up the Daniels. Got to take me cod liver oil now
3151 2018-09-17 17:24:35 Try using an oil when taking it off (baby oil, coconut oil, olive oil, etc.)

3158 2018-09-17 17:24:00 "apply pressure to Trump" ??? This has little to do with "pressure on Trump". AM & EM are welcoming the developments to satisfy key #oil/#gas-lobbyists (and the speculative financial markets of course) ... I have not the impression as if right hand knows what left hand does!

3161 2018-09-17 17:23:32 They just tried to call me and schedule a oil change for my old Subaru .   I’m not crying your crying
3162 2018-09-17 17:23:30 Senator Franken never had the chance to testify. When are you Republicans ever going to show a spine? Why are you OK with hypocrisy? Any woman who supports this backward thinking snake oil salesman is delusional. #cavanaugh #MerrickGarland #GOPRegime

3167 2018-09-17 17:23:04 if you're not willing to oil my scalp then you not the one
3168 2018-09-17 17:22:54 Things are more clear when I look back wondering why USA gave up top export of oil, gave up manufacturing, started common core education, flooding illegals into country and destroying the construction gig. Broke the backbone of the local economys. No more Friday pay checks, etc,
3169 2018-09-17 17:22:40 I wish somebody would have told me before I could use tea tree oil 
3170 2018-09-17 17:22:26 Actually, friend told me they just raised prices.  If this was an oil company there would 'price gauging' stories everywhere.
3171 2018-09-17 17:22:24 It is! "The Great Day of His Wrath" (1853) , John Martin, Oil on Canvas.
3172 2018-09-17 17:22:24 When I go home I need a good hot oil treatment & cut.
3173 2018-09-17 17:22:15 Are you trying to sell oil, or collectible cars? 
3174 2018-09-17 17:21:53 これは、ちなしなし
3175 2018-09-17 17:21:52 so is it just the same basic maintenance? belts, brakes oil changes? are the costs horrendous? lol gotta know before I spend a fucking ridiculous amount
3176 2018-09-17 17:21:48 Big pharmaceutical has poisoned minds against it.  Cannabis leaf and oil has many medicinal properties but if you use that you aren't buying their over priced drugs and paying for their outrageous bonuses.
3177 2018-09-17 17:21:47 what the fuck is happening why is everyone saying mark drinks olive oil
3178 2018-09-17 17:21:37 Lol taking people’s money... selling thin olive oil as hair magic... and that is not his daughter and he photoshops hair on them ndndbdjsnbsns

3180 2018-09-17 17:21:25 Not too much has changed for me from what I wrote in August. The data for August isn't out yet but the Demand/Supply ratio in those charts tends to lead Oil prices by ~6 months so we should see Oil move lower but it's so tough to ignore production headlines w/ Iran & Venezuela
3181 2018-09-17 17:21:05 My memory is starting to fail me...do remember Grich, Lynn and Downing as regualrs as well
3182 2018-09-17 17:20:55 At Jim Ovia's book Launch earlier today

Ambode said, "Who am I to speak after the Jagaban has spoken"

Jim Ovia also said, "Amazon GDP is higher than Nigeria's GDP, even with all the oil blocs we have"

Jim erroneously bashing Nigeria in front of V.P Osinbajo...
3183 2018-09-17 17:20:49 Weapon, What kind of weapon?

3185 2018-09-17 17:20:34 Amazing how I never relate to these 21st century social problems. Then again me and grooves are like oil & water.
3186 2018-09-17 17:20:32 No, I’m weird and have grown to enjoy the oil texture in my coffee
3187 2018-09-17 17:20:29 I happen to have beneficial genes that help convert ALA more efficiently & have some flax (not much), but also chia, Brussels sprouts, hemp, walnuts, and algae oil. I have tested and my O3/O6 levels & ratio 
3188 2018-09-17 17:20:11 Unsure of the oil you require? There’s lots of choice, how do you know what will work best? Our dedicated team of industry professionals would be happy to advise you. DM us today and a member of the team will be in touch

3192 2018-09-17 17:19:40 Maybe if he's against milk pricing control, he could be convinced that oil and gas shouldn't get any form of subsidy either?
3193 2018-09-17 17:19:33 All non american cars have expensive maintenance no matter the year. My step dad pays like 300-400 for an oil change on his Benz. It aint worth it.
3194 2018-09-17 17:19:29 Also... one last thing, if you have a hormonal imbalance and are using Monat products I HIGHLY suggest you look into the effects of red clover oil. It can be used as a health benefit for some, but it can wreck havoc on women with hormonal disorders or uterine cancer.
3195 2018-09-17 17:19:09 i met this girl who wants to work in oil and she’s very nice and all but like at this point she should know that uhhhh...that shit isn’t gonna work anymore, you know with the impending apocalypse due to our abuse and neglect of the planet?
3196 2018-09-17 17:19:04 but i dont have any olive oil
3197 2018-09-17 17:18:59 oh!イル
3198 2018-09-17 17:18:59 Booty need a oil treatment
3199 2018-09-17 17:18:58 Finally a candidate who's willing to defend big banks, stop & frisk innocent minorities and go easy on serial sexual harassers!
While he's at it maybe bring back whaling? Those whales have had a good run and we could use the oil!
3200 2018-09-17 17:18:57 I use cococut oil (that pure shit) to clease, a hot steamy towel to remove my makeup all the way until gone, works on water proof mascara too! And then i use witch hazel for toner and moisturize with coconut oil 
3201 2018-09-17 17:18:57 Agreed. If it was something major, couldn't see either side bothering. Especially since Upshall has become a pro of sorts at this PTO thing in recent years.
3202 2018-09-17 17:18:56 Eating broccoli for lunch... had an apple for breakfast ... I literally have damn near 0 appetite when I’m sick, yesterday I ate 1 piece of pizza at like 11 am and 1 chicken patty at 7pm and didn’t even wanna eat anything until now and I’ve eaten 3 pieces of bro oil and I’m full
3203 2018-09-17 17:18:50 Totalmente de acuerdo : La gestion venezolana ha sido catastrófica. No obstante, el breakeaven de los oil sands tenderá a aumentar, inversión proporcional a la bajada de su EROI (ya pasó su pico de EROI máximo en Canada. En Venezuela, ni idea).  Para Dakota, es otra historia...
3204 2018-09-17 17:18:50 Take a day (where you know it doesn’t have to be fixed) and put coconut oil on the ends and half way up to your roots. Leave it in over night (or all day if you have it in a bun) and then rinse it out with warm water and then wash your hair.
3205 2018-09-17 17:18:47 Some examples: (1) Tampon Tax (2) The Common Fisheries Policy (3) VAT on things like Electricity, Gas, Heating Oil and books (4) Free movement of Labour (5) Working time directive.

There are literally thousands of laws imposed by the EU. Did you really think there were none?

3208 2018-09-17 17:18:02 Afraid this goes well beyond the ATA just having a tin ear. The education establishment seems to be run now by West Vancouver-type trendies, who would not recognize the importance of our oil/gas economic base until they can't fill up their Priuses. Remember also, UofA and Suzuki.
3209 2018-09-17 17:18:01 True sha 
3210 2018-09-17 17:17:56 thank you. aside from the fish oil i have not heard of the others. I strongly believe these children under 10 can reverse & heal whatever injury/condition they have with diet. got some research to do. thanks again.

3216 2018-09-17 17:17:05 Damn, I guess I should go on the quest for a beard oil. I just hated touching my beard and having oily hands... 
3217 2018-09-17 17:17:02 Who is behind the oil prices hike.If its a compulson or deliberately hiked.
3218 2018-09-17 17:17:01 Slave labor: okay
Child sex workers: check
Save Lives by making and giving away free cannabis oil: DEATH PENALTY! Is this country being run by Bayer and Scott Gottlieb?

3221 2018-09-17 17:16:39 All this for oil! When oil is no more will the West steal water from other countries?
3222 2018-09-17 17:16:22 As it should be!!!
3223 2018-09-17 17:16:14 So what has oil got to do with notable reforms to liberate the north from its chronic illiteracy? Oil has been a curse for Nigeria. The possible solutions to close the disparities between the North and South is been discussed here using US as a case study not oil
3224 2018-09-17 17:16:12 Oil? You have got to be kidding.........
3225 2018-09-17 17:15:49 Still doing business with terrorists I see ... weren’t they responsible for 9/11 ... why would you even engage with a country like Saudi Arabia ... as long as you keep supporting them your part of the problem and funding trrrorist activities ... is the oil really worth it? !!!!!
3226 2018-09-17 17:15:49 Except even if you choose to disbelieve the SNP government's GERS figures for god-knows-what reason, you still have the £30bn missing oil money so we'd have a deficit twice the size that Ireland had to deal with *anyway*. No wonder you're running away.
3227 2018-09-17 17:15:41 Cut them in half horizontally, scoop out seeds, nob of butter, chilli oil, salt pepper and into an oven to bake. Yum.

3242 2018-09-17 17:13:36 What 'scare stories'? Like oil being worth £30 billion less by now than the SNP predicted in 2013? That kind of 'scare story'?
3243 2018-09-17 17:13:36 Every politician has his compulsions. Pak will keep his oil prices low and face fiscal consequences. We will keep them high and write off farmer loans, build statues, spend 4000 cr on govt ads, etc etc.

BTW let’s not compare with Pak. Even Maharashtra state has more GDP than Pak
3244 2018-09-17 17:13:34 1. Don't  pick  that was one of my downfalls
Uhh, hellicrism (sp?) Is one, i gotta double check with my momma for the rest, shes like an essential oil quren
3245 2018-09-17 17:13:29 Congis are spreading news that NaMo govt repaid ONLY 3500 cr of the oil bond time bomb left behind by MMS.

Accha? Who paid the interest for the 1.3 lac cr??

We are such a strange bunch, none will q fiscal prudence of such moves but will q how much other guy repaid. Shame
3246 2018-09-17 17:13:19 Apparently, we will be free to sell olive oil in containers over 5 litres. 
I'm not making that up. From the UK's vast olive plantations, of course.
3247 2018-09-17 17:13:18 Sir may god bless you... sincerely do take some steps in Sc St act for punishment of its misuses and in oil price front. Or else your years of good works will not be bearing fruits in 2019.

3249 2018-09-17 17:12:50 What about crude oil?
Seems this is impervious in application to petroleum.
3250 2018-09-17 17:12:50 In the mid-1900s #Greenland was known for manufacturing oil used for lighting, soap and lubrication. The product—taken from the skin of whales, walruses and seals by using vats, presses and tubs like these—was supplanted in the early 1960s by vegetable oil. (Pic by @wordlybeth)
3251 2018-09-17 17:12:48 Plantlife = fundamental to ALL life on earth.  CO2 from vegetation and marine life becomes oil, natural gas and limestone, trapping it and eliminating it's CO2 from the life sustaining tropospheric cycle.  We dig it up and burn it... releasing it back to the life giving cycle.

Was told to bring back for 1pm ... now we wait to see how they’re planning to resolve. If they’re going to charge I hope they’re prepared for she-lion mom.

3263 2018-09-17 17:11:27 that's why it is so important to buy my special extra virgin olive oil.
3264 2018-09-17 17:11:17 Your question was why Govt did not gave any benefit when prices of crude oil was low, and when it came out that the Govt did so to pay oil bonds, your topic quickly shifted to Nirav Modi and Mallya

3267 2018-09-17 17:11:00 So you want subsidy for petrol like UPA had given and added 4lakh crore oil bonds on people ? This subsidy was gulped by rich people and inflation rose to 10.5% and poor people were happy? You have to pay for the goods or services whether from left pocket or right  is immaterial
3268 2018-09-17 17:10:45 I get my cbd oil online, it comes from America- really good and decent strength. Also have oil from CBD Brothers, got a sample as it’s quite expensive + didn’t fancy committing to a high price tag + it not working.

3271 2018-09-17 17:10:39 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.

3276 2018-09-17 17:09:29 I dislike him even more for that @safeagain1. Fossil fuel Oil is an archaic outdated energy source. It’s plain lazy. We have alternative such as bio oil which burns cleaner, takes 90 percent less energy to manufacture and if it spills biodegrades. We have natural gas, solar, wind
3277 2018-09-17 17:09:27 @KlasraRauf is Honey and @AmirMateen2 is Olive Oil or it’s other way around ?
3278 2018-09-17 17:09:26 The issue is corruption and putting your entire economy into one resource (oil)

3281 2018-09-17 17:09:01 You really think propaganda isn't used to promote capitalist endeavors? "Remember the Maine" much? Or how about the use of 9/11 to start wars in several countries with zero ties to the attack (but plenty of oil)?

Do you understand its role in history?
3282 2018-09-17 17:09:01 I stopped eating bread and drinking beer! After that, my skin liked being cleaned with coconut oil and i started using essential oils to remove scar tissue.

3288 2018-09-17 17:08:33 It's what Trump 's oil sanctions against Iran will throw out come November .@les_politiques posted an interesting article.

3304 2018-09-17 17:07:10 Blow drying is nice! If you don’t already have a fine wooden comb and a boar's hair brush, I highly recommend both of those things. A high-quality beard oil is also going to help with that softness. In the winter I add in a balm later in the day because moisture.

3312 2018-09-17 17:06:21 That really sucks. I'm not sure if you can get your hands on any, but raw apple cider vinegar on a cotton ball works wonders for that. And coconut oil is a great lubricant to prevent further friction.
3313 2018-09-17 17:06:02 What shit is @vinitgoenka talking about oil bonds. It’s these bonds that saved oil prices from hitting out of ceilings during that time. There is no cash flow for oil bonds. Interest definitely was paid of 44000 cr. But only 2 bonds matured in last 4 yrs. total long to 3500 cr.
3314 2018-09-17 17:05:46 I’m nearly shocked by the amount of CBD oil ads that have been popping up everywhere for me. FBI man must know how riddled with anxiety I am  thanks bb

3328 2018-09-17 17:04:40 Do you know how much #gas & #oil #Ireland needs?
3329 2018-09-17 17:04:34 Except vijii no one did anything special.
Others doing the same thing with oil, water ,shampoo.
So why pin point only Riythvika.
3330 2018-09-17 17:04:19 so how does that equate with Andrew Wilson's assertion: "We'll assume for the purposes of our projections that oil is producing zero revenues"

3345 2018-09-17 17:03:02 Thanks Daniel very kind, that is a mighty fine oil you use, no one ever stocks that here in the south! We use beeswax oil from Liberon, prefer the thicker oils if I’m honest

3381 2018-09-17 16:59:32 Absolutely, you need to invoke an emotional response to successfully package and sell policies. But the policies themselves have to be based on facts. Otherwise you are just selling snake oil.

3) big pharma
4) big oil/forestry (hemp based products)

3483 2018-09-17 16:49:33 Sudan Hussein was being funding Military weapons and training by the U.S. - then he mentioned he was leaving the corporation for its father Europe. He wanted to only trade oil for Euros .... DIED

3488 2018-09-17 16:48:59 people talk about it like its an oil change
3489 2018-09-17 16:48:57 Imagine being so in denial about the state of your franchise that you shoot the messenger. Not sure why some oil fans insist on burying their heads to (fair) criticism of their team and its management. I'm rooting for the Oilers to make something of their time with McDavid, truly

3491 2018-09-17 16:48:41 are you implying Trudeau never had a job?  and I believe SH worked in the mailroom of an oil company before entering politics.
3492 2018-09-17 16:48:31 Yes. Some alluminum utensils for Dalits, SC-ST, fishermen. The maid only has to serve. They were not allowed to go near Well and Tulsi. Not to enter in the waranda. Some festival days, the maid used to pour oil on their head standing while they're sitting.

3501 2018-09-17 16:46:37 It's easy enough to make at home in a food processor. Nuts, a neutral-flavored oil, salt, sugar  (or cane syrup or maple syrup).  Shelled pistachio butter is pretty teriffic

3503 2018-09-17 16:46:23 For me They make great oven chips Jack - cut into good size wedges - olive oil, salt and pepper (herbs too) shake around to coat and slow bake, turning a couple of times till start to brown.  Can also use them like this as base for a really flavourful soup.

3529 2018-09-17 16:43:54 I'm okay with this to start with.  Why?  Because it's RNH v. Letescu meaning that even if Luc isn't a puck carrier & is slower on retrieval, Oil will have 4 guys who can enter zone. RNH might be the best of all at gaining blueline under control.

3589 2018-09-17 16:38:56 It's not "medicine". The Holy oil is a nutrient and cannabis is a vital nutrient. The Holy oil is made by the apothecaries of Christ. We must have specific knowledge about extraction and techniques to make these nutrients. The cannabis is bought legally and inspected. God bless!

3607 2018-09-17 16:37:25 @rajnathsingh The public does not understand the game of oil and you will not understand. If you want to win elections, you have to think seriously.
3608 2018-09-17 16:37:12 Equal pay for equal work sounds fine to me.  How many women work on oil rigs?  How many women are lumberjacks?  Fishing boat workers? Garbage truck drivers? Roofers? Etc.  IF they do equal work, for equal time--they should (AND ALREADY DO, btw) get equal pay.
3609 2018-09-17 16:37:09 All the negatives associated with #Nigeria are #British instigated because they want to divert the world's attention, so that they can continue to steal #Biafra OIL AND GAS. #Biafra simply demands #BiafraReferendum.

3630 2018-09-17 16:34:57 En esta empresa he comparado desarrollos informáticos, he estado en mkting... mi compañero ahora está en el car sharing que hemos montado con Kia @wible_esp, por ponerte un ejemplo. No todo es oil&gas. Ahora vendo poliolefinas pero nunca se sabe. Veremos.

3632 2018-09-17 16:34:39 Add a little olive oil or cooking oil. High heat for 3-5 mins, stirring & serve! Depending on level of heat u can substitute jalapeños or serranos with green bell pepper.

3634 2018-09-17 16:34:33 I can’t own a single shirt without dropping some food on it that ends up leaving an oil stain of some kind that never washes out.

3635 2018-09-17 16:34:28 When I’m worth 100 mil I’m going to have a big ass oil painting over my fireplace of me sitting on a gold throne, wit an all gold regalia, gold crown wit diamonds, a gold sceptre, wit a lion on my left and a tiger on my right.
3636 2018-09-17 16:34:27 You eat eggs. You eat oil. You eat mustard. Those are the three ingredients in mayonnaise. You're like my teenage daughter telling me "I like honey and nuts, but I don't like honey nut cheerios "
3637 2018-09-17 16:34:25 Some of y'all are on some weird ass shit. Rub coconut oil plus aloe vera and banana skin soaked inside wet ashes. All for clear skin?

3639 2018-09-17 16:34:21 Looks like it’s a synthetic blend vs. Mobil 1 which is a fully synthetic - helps explain differential. Love seeing oil industry disrupted though - even in a small way.

3642 2018-09-17 16:34:00 We do use US oil. I just posted a link that outlines US oil CONSUMPTION that is the amount of oil the US uses not exports. We only USE about 19% foreign oil.

3647 2018-09-17 16:33:46 Success isn't parameters of Fulfilment.
For example 
Most of the edible oil are greatly successful but we know, it's biggest threat to mankind.
Likewise 
Biscuits are success?
Truth? 
Glucose Biscuits-It's biggest scam. 
It has flour, yeast, Essence, sugar- 
Nothing healthy?
3648 2018-09-17 16:33:41 Definitely. I know at least two PTSD sufferers who found cannabis oil stopped their night terrors.
3649 2018-09-17 16:33:38 ... Just a special type of anointing oil

3654 2018-09-17 16:33:08 2. As the crude oil prices have gone higher by ~$ 18/barrel in recent months, the price of petroleum products has not increased accordingly, so now the difference is coveted by reducing taxes.

3663 2018-09-17 16:32:15 No body is saying that oil prices should not be linked to crude markets. All we are saying is that the doubling of central taxes on crude should be reversed. No further pil bonds need to be taken for that and price will come down by Rs. 13
3664 2018-09-17 16:32:13 In my view it is due to a meltdown. Most O&G companies are run by the wrong principles. Even high oil prices do not help.

3667 2018-09-17 16:31:45 and bailing out the auto industry is a different phenomenon than decades of subsidies paid to republican donors like big ag and big oil... but I guess self reliance is just for those other people... the non billionaires

3671 2018-09-17 16:31:22 I bought some organic peanut butter at Whole Foods recently (yeah, I did that).  Only to realize later that it’s made with palm oil and sugar…. I think Amazon’s changed the rules for what can go on WF’s shelves.
3672 2018-09-17 16:31:18 Have you considered an oil? I try to follow all of the steps of Korean skin care and I have found oils to be quite helpful. I use it at night as my final step when I do my regular routine. Overnight masks also work very well. Being in my 40s, dry skin is a struggle.
3673 2018-09-17 16:31:17 1. We need to understand why Assd ws saying so, at that time crude oil in the international market was $60/barrel which has now increased to $78/barrel. The price of all petroleum products is based on the crude oil prices in International market.
3674 2018-09-17 16:31:03 When it’s pumping oil then I will believe them, until then consider it all BS!

3690 2018-09-17 16:29:26 Day before race and I change the oil of the buck 25 and it was gray and spelled like nothing but clutches. Said fuck it and sent it anyway, half way threw the last race I regretted that decision 
3691 2018-09-17 16:29:23 For sure the oil helps but how do you explain the gap in lending over the last three years?
3692 2018-09-17 16:29:19 Oil Prices rose as investors focussed on the impact of U.S. sanctions on Iran despite assurances by Washington that Saudi Arabia, Russia and the US could together raise output fast enough to offset falling supplies.

3700 2018-09-17 16:28:54 Oil companies have been building measures to cope with sea level rise into their engineering plans for as long as they have been finding the climate misinformation campaign you have fallen prey to. Feel free to check those facts of you don't believe me.

3706 2018-09-17 16:28:08 Royal Dutch Shell announced plans to cap leaks of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, across its oil and gas operations as it tries to sharply curb carbon emissions

3708 2018-09-17 16:27:53 Whatever is financially beneficial, I don't think the Chinese gov care about the Palestinian issues or Iran other than oil imports, MeK can pump oil. China have their own issues with Uighurs. Looked like what's happening in Myanmar might be relevant to China (port/pipeline).
3709 2018-09-17 16:27:50 Climate change from burning oil is endangering our food supplies through sea level rise, drought and flood. It threatens the food security of billions and the resulting famine, migration and chaos could easily precipitate was that escalate into thermonuclear holocaust.
3710 2018-09-17 16:27:49 This is my first season with #MyFriendAlexa and it has been a great experience so far. Discovered many amazing blogs, burning Midnight oil, reading 10-15 blogs a day. Sadly, I miss out many viewers when not in reading list.Still, a good learning experience @blogchatter

3714 2018-09-17 16:27:12 I think that's ECACTLY the reason they NEED to fail. Breaking up Standard Oil and AT&T were some of the best things our government did. Social Media has been monopolized to the point were Twitter, FaceBook, Reddit are public squares and should be subject to the same laws as such.

3718 2018-09-17 16:26:59 The new "Price Controls" are more subtle than in the past. Start watching oil on Monday & Tuesday every week. It get chipped (if I can use a football term) every week on those two days. Why? It's the Pavlovian HFT Fade w no hard data to oppose it until after the close on Tuesday.

3732 2018-09-17 16:25:08 Generally heavy oil all require the same infrastructure. High-TAN oil has napthenic acids that activate at high temps requiring coker upgrades to avoid degradation. WCS, Mayan and Merey are all close enough they are run identically. Price diffs on these grades are due to access.

3735 2018-09-17 16:25:03 personal responsibility and self reliance like farm subsidies and tax breaks for oil companies and bail outs for coal companies who have been put out of business by natural gas... individualism like shitting yourself in a rage when people say happy holidays
3736 2018-09-17 16:24:58 The devastation caused by soviet Russian dictators is a fact, but Russia is now a capitalist dictatorship based on fossil fuel extraction. Capitalism has spread worldwide and its most powerful industry is resisting all efforts to move away from oil, a key cause of eco collapse.

3741 2018-09-17 16:24:20 CBD as applied by majority of companies on the market is snake oil and has no health efficacy...only properly extracted & ingested full spectrum extracts have proven (double blind studies) benefits. Most companies just isolate CBD & back up product w/ results from full spec data.
3742 2018-09-17 16:24:16 I never even thought of edibles being used like that. I jus hear all great things about cbd oil, I’ve never used it myself or had any need to really but I think it’s definitely worth looking into

3748 2018-09-17 16:23:32 RT if you agree @BNNBloomberg should have Western Canadian Select (WCS) oil prices on the TV ticker right beside WTI.

Canadian oil prices matter to Canadians. We’re selling our oil for a massive discount.

3751 2018-09-17 16:23:19 Yeah, definitely! I've been using coconut oil as well and it has helped mitigate dryness.
3752 2018-09-17 16:23:18 Very broken. We the people are who is supposed to count. Not big pharma, oil companies, or the NRA. It’s so disgusting and at times makes me feel like we truly are helpless in this!

OP: DROPPERS? Drops, I said DROPS ~
3758 2018-09-17 16:22:43 I had the same problem. After years of pain killers, mirena, trialling different pills, the one thing that has helped manage my pain is CBD Oil and trying to be Plant Based.

3829 2018-09-17 16:14:06 I’ve been talking about a whole lotta different places, Venezuela included. VEN is a mono-commodity economy based on its oil deposits. It nationalized it’s oil business to pay for core services and took a huge hit bc US domestic natural gas production cratered the price of oil.

3901 2018-09-17 16:05:54 Exactly! The squeaky wheel gets the oil. Time to start acting ijust like the Dems and play dirty political and get something done. We are in disparate times and if we don’t start acting soon will truly be too late.
3902 2018-09-17 16:05:42 It's a huge problem that they side with big oil and big pharma at times. They shouldn't be but at least they aren't siding with those industries as much Republicans. We need to work on voting for democrats that are running without PAC money because that is the start of fixing it.
3903 2018-09-17 16:05:36 Great time to be in the oil business.  I bet new codes will require some kind of shut off valve at homes.

3936 2018-09-17 16:02:32 Only ever made soup out of them, after roasting first, drizzled with olive oil, salt, pepper and cumin. Sometimes roast onions alongside, so they get caramalised. Then whizz them up in a blender with some stock and bingo.
3937 2018-09-17 16:02:06 Don’t you find it interesting the difference in the way ‘Uncle Jack’ Walker and the Sheikh are portrayed? 

Working class lad made good versus ‘oil money’. 

Given all the clubs they could have bought I love the fact our owners chose to take on ‘the biggest club in the world’
3938 2018-09-17 16:01:46 For the millionth time, a $20 advertised oil change costs — wait for — $44.95.  Along with accusations that the previous vendor put “recycled oil” in my Jeep. #LOL #Scam #FakeNews
3939 2018-09-17 16:01:24 The entire Middle East would be better off if it had all of it's secular dictators back. But those people didn't want to continue selling oil exclusively for dollars & that harms Uncle Sam's ability to spend at the expense of the rest of the world.

3968 2018-09-17 15:58:11 This is 100% true for all major banks. It is naive to think otherwise. I have a BA in Advertising and I've studied psychology and propaganda. It is just about money and power. This isn't even a good thing they are doing. They should just promote Cannabis Oil if they cared

4025 2018-09-17 15:50:15  Run it into oblivion you mean? NEVER GONNA STOP as long as children are locked in cages and separated from their parents. Not as long as he keeps selling off God’s most beautiful country and oceans in America to drill oil. I wish I had more room to go on... BYE!
4026 2018-09-17 15:50:15 Can’t really fix it buttttt warm oil treatments and deep conditioning for a weak will mask it 
4027 2018-09-17 15:50:07 Если бы, я решила, что гуляш нужно оставить на попозже, было бы веселее
4028 2018-09-17 15:49:59 Utter nonsense report. And btw can Labour apologise for the lack of a trillion pound oil (like Norway) fund that labour decided not to set up
4029 2018-09-17 15:49:56 YAS.
You can get CBD oil in the local chemist.
4030 2018-09-17 15:49:55 At UN Security Council discussion on #DPRK, @RussiaUN rejects US narrative on oil transfers, other measures to evade sanctions.  "Bringing railroads together" is not a violation of sanctions regimes.  We should promote cooperation where it is legal to do so.
4031 2018-09-17 15:49:36 i would get a flat tire the day jax decides to run away and i am supposed to open the boutique &trey leaves his phone at home & my oil change is due.. smh 
4032 2018-09-17 15:49:28 Totally agree....The View should never host someone like Chuck Schumer who spreads division and hate.

4034 2018-09-17 15:49:14 Today I found my very last oil painting that was "lost" in 2015 and now that it's been found I hope it's lost forever god that piece is embarrassing. That exact painting is the reason I quit doing oils on canvas and turn into printmaking studio man I can't fuckin paint with oils

4036 2018-09-17 15:49:03 Argon Oil hair color at sally's is my go to. So long as you take care of it, it'll last a long ass time. And it'll strip out in 1 or 2 round lightening mix when you wanna get it out. Argon Oil has one that is nicer to you and you can do 2 rounds 24 hours apart if you want.
4037 2018-09-17 15:48:52 Wassuh mane uh oil pastel eating ahh
4038 2018-09-17 15:48:51 In my opinion I feel like if you have a vehicle you should know how to at least change a tire or  change your own oil 
4039 2018-09-17 15:48:50 MPL oil babe
4040 2018-09-17 15:48:50 @elonmusk Do you think it is possible that you have been played by the Saudis (big oil) now that they invest a meagre 1 bilion in Lucid?
4041 2018-09-17 15:48:46 You're producing a documentary on Axe Oil?

I'll convey your condolences to them.

4046 2018-09-17 15:48:13 Cigarette and asbestos manufacturers say thank you.
As does the coal industry (what little of it remains).
As does the oil industry. 
Those who prefer a less toxic and degraded planet to live on?
Not so much.
4047 2018-09-17 15:48:11 Did the oil industry deadbeats in #congress get the memo?? #infrastructure
4048 2018-09-17 15:47:58 Just asking for a pipeline.  Is that too much to ask for. Maybe use Canadian oil in this country instead of importing Saudi oil. Is that too much to ask.
4049 2018-09-17 15:47:57 Roast them and then use them in soup.  I stick in the oven with a tiny bit of oil whilst I get a basic vegetable soup going, when the soup is done, semi-puree with potato masher & then add in the well-roasted squash etc.  Adds a lovely taste, nice variety of texture & looks good.
4050 2018-09-17 15:47:56 1. Roast it and the use it in curry
2. Roast and then hollow out and stuff with whatever takes your fancy
3. Cut into chunks and peel and mix with other veg, season, wrap in tinfoil with a dollop of marmite and some oil and shove on bbq/ in oven 
4. Roast seeds for eating...

"nah man, just an oil change, its fine"
4055 2018-09-17 15:47:28 Totally agree.   Schumer exposing himself as so politically biased and spreading division and hate.  Thank you !!

4059 2018-09-17 15:47:13 It's a shame the oil companies have so much power in the U.S.. We could have the same thing here.
4060 2018-09-17 15:47:06 Actually not a lot - salt, olive oil bit of rosemary and bang it in the oven! Tried spiralising it once to make low carb spaghetti then had a proper word with myself.
4061 2018-09-17 15:47:05 ホントそれー！
4062 2018-09-17 15:46:58 There is no gunpoint involved. USD is a global currency and is the bases of all valuations, all major transactions and the oil trading houses. The military spending protects Europe, Asia, middle East... and as a result of stability and protection global economy keeps growing
4063 2018-09-17 15:46:51 Sekarang gw jualan produk. Produknya ini olahan dari kelapa, ato nama beken skg mah VCO (Virgin Coconut Oil).
4064 2018-09-17 15:46:37 I was on synthetic marijuana b4 & it took like 2 hrs to kick in, then it hit like a mack truck & was ridiculously high. I can drive & function normally on opiates, so I'm kinda stuck. I wish they'd prescribe cannabis oil for Lyme, I hear it works & antibiotics haven't for me 2/2
4065 2018-09-17 15:46:36 I use it for my migraines and shoulder pains. I use the oil because it works better for me. THC makes me really nauseous so I tried CBD and I don't take migraine or pain meds anymore. They have it in candies and such too (the oil does kind of taste weird)
4066 2018-09-17 15:46:31 Her state is suppose to be an oil rich state
4067 2018-09-17 15:46:30 Jacob did a handstand for five minutes to get that oil into his hair
4068 2018-09-17 15:46:29 Every one of those items are related directly to oil production

Again you're a hypocrite

4073 2018-09-17 15:45:49 I think the Saudi’s getting into EVs is good news for all EV makers, including Tesla. Writing is on the wall. ICE cars and oil are on the way out.
4074 2018-09-17 15:45:41 This only further demonstrates the end of Big Oil's campaign 2 crush the electrification of transport. Med & small oil will soon come on board as they'll have no choice. Automotive, desperately trying to catch up now realizing they wasted resources on crushing over innovating.
4075 2018-09-17 15:45:39 A superb and important report by @jocelynzuck Jocelyn Zuckerman on palm oil and its impact on public health in India. Published by @thenation in conjunction with @FERNnews. #India, #PalmOil #diabetes #fastfood

4077 2018-09-17 15:45:27 did any of you read it. If you did what about it made you think it was anything more then a bill to placate oil and gas companies. $ati.v
4078 2018-09-17 15:45:25 I remember watching Osinbajo talk about zero-based budgeting like it was the next best thing after crude oil. Truth be told,  I was inspired. 

I remember the ground breaking ceremony to kick-start the Ogoni cleanup.
4079 2018-09-17 15:45:22 Hydrogen can also be sourced as a byproduct of oil refining..so really a fossil fuel. It needs certification to be “green”. Also an inefficient use of RE via hydrolysis. Better to electrify the line and use electricity directly (maybe 75% efficiency solar panel to wheels).
4080 2018-09-17 15:45:14 it's our Hydrating Oil! 
4081 2018-09-17 15:45:13 Not a bad deal. $45 for an oil change and complete car wash.

4088 2018-09-17 15:44:41 I can't resist a good skincare regime! 

But I swear by witch hazel (as a toner), tea tree oil (for acne and hair bumps) and Bio-Oil mixed with my every day lotion.

Saves my life every single time.
4089 2018-09-17 15:44:33 The oil.

4092 2018-09-17 15:44:30 I haven't played for probably two years. I was a new player and got up to oil processing, at which time I promptly became overwhelmed and quit. :P Been putting in the effort to learn this time though! And oh, the world of opportunities that awaited!
4093 2018-09-17 15:44:30 Sardines in oil should help ease it out

4099 2018-09-17 15:43:50 In case you haven't connected the news dots... Putin owns the largest oil company in Russia. He made a 500 Billion dollar deal with the CEO of Exxon Mobil. Obama put sanctions in place which stopped that deal. Russia then hacked into our government in order to get Trump elected.
4100 2018-09-17 15:43:47 How many stater motors (plus the extra fuel to turn over a dead weight stationary engine - with the oil drained away) do you get through a year?!
4101 2018-09-17 15:43:43 YES! DANG LUCAS OIL!

4103 2018-09-17 15:43:41 Sure, Venezuela is not a socialist state, it's effectively a kleptocracy, where significant amounts of the people's resources (oil revenues) have been stolen by a small minority.
4104 2018-09-17 15:43:29 It is all deception can we buy oil in other curruncy answer is no has our export increse in usa answer is no in fact export to europ has has increse  this also bust argument weeker rs increse export it is well thought conspiracy of imf and world bank to keep other country indebt

4122 2018-09-17 15:41:39 Ha ha ha I would normally order a meal and ask for hot water with lemon coz soft drinks mess around with my eating plan. I was charged R7 for water at Olive n Oil and I couldn't believe it

4125 2018-09-17 15:41:06 Local media reporting on electric scooters which reduce emissions from automobiles, then report, by the way, the smoke hovering over El Segundo is just a "planned burn" by a Chevron oil refinery.

Coffee and olive oil.

OK, for coffee and olive oil I recommend the top recipe called roast with gravy, which takes 2 hours 45 minutes to make.

4137 2018-09-17 15:40:03 Baseless & meaningless allegations. Doesn't look to charges framed by court again him. Bail or jail leaders enchant 15 Lacs, oil.prices, lynching etc. No solid issue to accuse BJP. Nation mocks & fade up to hear  repeated useless allegations

Trudeau in power means, in LOTR terms, that Sauron has the One Ring. There is only darkness and pain on the horizon. No investment, no hiring, no R&D, and layoffs. #ableg #cdnpoli
4143 2018-09-17 15:39:26 Look at ALL the unrest in SA? Look at the accidents, look at the political factions ?? When did it start ? AFTER BRICS started the Development Bank and Putin suggested that BRICS rebuild SYRIA so they have a way to get to Iran , oil from Iran,
4144 2018-09-17 15:39:25 Keep doing the double cleansing & try to pick face wash which more into balance your pH. Use hydrating toner and do exfoliation for twice a week. Do not scrub your face!

4162 2018-09-17 15:38:00 Senka tu tak sesuai sebab ada mineral oil. Clinelle okay cuma tak best pulak bila pakai. Hat loose powder tu tak pakai sebab time consuming nak cepat p kerja pakai sunscreen ja

4169 2018-09-17 15:37:06 I have no problem with having universal health care in the USA, but it should be funded by taxing the wealthy and creating funds similar to the sovereign funds in Norway and Alaska from the proceeds of oil, etc.
4170 2018-09-17 15:37:04 @ArmorOfHalo Does Danny still do that thing where he fries the rice before putting oil in it? @QueenKoopah do you know if that's an actual thing that's supposed to be done?

4173 2018-09-17 15:36:41 Trust me where Ted Cruz was born  in the city of Calgary. It is an oil town and the men like to play hockey drink lots of beer with many fist fights. Ted would not have made it through grade school with that attitude.
4174 2018-09-17 15:36:34 Interesting graphs, except for the per capita GDP one which includes a ton of oil wealth that is not fair to compare - both because it's neither a natural gift for Ethiopia nor that wealth trickled down to regular Nigerians.

4179 2018-09-17 15:36:15 Well Mr. Ultra Idiot Vinay Sharma, you have deliberately forgotten to convert Pakistani Currency into Indian Rupee. Convert that than compare it to the prices of Petrol n Diesel in India controlled by Oil Companies. Such lumpen updates only appease you cattlehead masters not us.

4183 2018-09-17 15:35:52 I realize their oil isn't the "best" - but their production continues to decline - *despite* having the most proven reserves of any country in the world.
4184 2018-09-17 15:35:51 Chuck Schumer is a political hack. On The View ratcheting up anti Kavanaugh sentiment.  So obvious he is pandering to women, democrats, etc on delaying confirmation. Democrats have gone too far on this one.  Dividing America. Pushing hate. Only caring about politics. @TheView

4193 2018-09-17 15:34:36 Yet nothing made from that oil provides the octane that helps reduce air quality challenges in our cities. Plus, it’s non-carcinogenic like many of the compounds in gasoline
4194 2018-09-17 15:34:26 Opposition to #LightRail...?!

Only the stagnant cannot look to the future and recognize common community needs, born of dual resource-drains involving increasing populations & reduced dependence on oil/gas/cars.

Denver continues to thrive - and continues to expand light rail.

4206 2018-09-17 15:32:29 Unfortunately the money controls the DNC and rigs the rules to keep changes from being made. Even after small improvements are made, like refusing oil $ the consultants step in and get their grift back. The DNC needs a completely new staff if unity is ever to be achieved.
4207 2018-09-17 15:32:04 That makes sense! I mean, it is the logical way to think... but I wasn’t expecting this kind of logical thinking from them. I always thought that those rich guys from Saudi Arabia had the “oil ‘til the last drop” policy.
Good to know that this is changing!
4208 2018-09-17 15:31:57 I learned to pass my test in a VW Polo and then bought and learned to drive in a recent but already-clapped-out 1.0 Metro. I concur with your assessment of quality; apparently they were *meant* to leak oil on the street outside.

4214 2018-09-17 15:31:29 Other than the fact Nigeria is the 6th largest oil producing country in the world. Africa is a beautiful continent with many problems, just different from those on other continents. Lots of things need fixing...
4215 2018-09-17 15:30:44 Rockefeller's Standard Oil operated like this in the 20s. They would offer to buy competitors in a region. If they refused Standard Oil undersold their product for impossibly low prices driving the competition out of business. Then they would pick up the business for cheap.
4216 2018-09-17 15:30:39 Nothing like starving to bring you around to how good oil is for our economy.

4222 2018-09-17 15:30:26 Overwhelmingly, it is the American population (and that of other developed nations) that drives up demand for products—manufactured goods from Asia, oil from the Middle East, rare minerals for electronics from Africa—that result in large amounts of pollution.
4223 2018-09-17 15:30:25 It does have olive oil, and coarse ground pepper. I think I’m going to pick up some basil-infused olive oil from the local specialty shop. (And honestly, while I love the balsamic glaze, if the tomatoes are ripe enough, it would probably do without even for me…)

4249 2018-09-17 15:27:30 Securing their future. They know that the industry has started to move away from oil. If they do not invest early they'll loose out.

4265 2018-09-17 15:25:40 It's a financial stance, and therefor political. If oil companies and their bought politicians wouldn't lose money we would all be driving green cars and recycling by now in our solar powered homes...but the greed is real. Real ugly

4296 2018-09-17 15:21:26  your head carry oil
4297 2018-09-17 15:21:24 Not sure why I bought motor oil for my Jeep this weekend when I could have used the coffee from work this morning.
4298 2018-09-17 15:21:20 With all the polygraph shit hitting the media right now because of Kavanagh's accuser, its important to remember that polygraphs are pure snake oil.  I don't disbelieve the accusation, and hope she gets her chance to testify, but that has nothing to do with passing a polygraph.
4299 2018-09-17 15:21:17 Sandwich Special,The Italian. Salami,pepperoni,provolone cheese,lettuce,tomato,red onion,bell pepper,pepperoncini,oil&vinegar dressing,and Greek oregano.
4300 2018-09-17 15:21:02 Yep. And the world loses Iranian oil and wti shoots up to $100 a barrel and gas prices hot $5 a gallon destroying every penny the tax cut saved.
4301 2018-09-17 15:21:00 I’ve been waiting on this oil change for 2 HOURS, T-W-O
4302 2018-09-17 15:20:50 I have a few $25.00 off gift cards ..are you wanting to order cbd oil or the black seed oil? Let me know  lots of other choices
4303 2018-09-17 15:20:40 Can someone get me up to speed?
4304 2018-09-17 15:20:36 Assuming this, the 82,9% of the oil from the disaster of the deepwater horizon has been destinated to other than producing electricity... oh, we could continue over and over...Please.
4305 2018-09-17 15:20:32 ถ้ากลับมานะจะฟาดให้
4306 2018-09-17 15:20:29 Nani pakai oil cleanser apaa
4307 2018-09-17 15:20:24 Because we had "marijuana is a gateway drug" ingrained in us. My kids laugh with me about my turn around since I've been using it and cbd oil for neuropathy and insomnia. I'm a vocal convert.
4308 2018-09-17 15:20:08 Its real sexy though to see a typically prissy city bih all wet & covered in oil going down under to ensure his girl is properly serviced & well lubricated. 
4309 2018-09-17 15:20:07 I want an oil painting of this to hang over my fireplace.
4310 2018-09-17 15:20:04 You can keep the balsamic vinegar, I'll take olive oil instead.

Does look pretty tasty though.
4311 2018-09-17 15:19:52 I understand perfectly and it is really worrying, in addition to what you inform me, the payment of that loan is worrisome because it would be guaranteed with the oil deposits that are patrte of Venezuelan national territory, which also has coltan and other valuable minerals,
4312 2018-09-17 15:19:43 I'm Oil Can Harry! And I'm Sit Down!
4313 2018-09-17 15:19:40 This man just tried to tell me an oil change is 80 dollars and when I say I flashed

4318 2018-09-17 15:19:09 So last year Ryleigh kept getting lice from a classmate (gross I know but fuck it, it happens) so I started putting tea tree oil in all her hair products to try & avoid that shit & this morning I used a spray on Josie’s hair & she says, “uh... ew that smells like lice.” LMAO BYE
4319 2018-09-17 15:19:08 @OGJOnline why are oil prices so high?

4324 2018-09-17 15:18:25 Well, I'd cook spaghetti on the side, Then other other port, add olive oil and Fry some garlic along with tomatoes and lentils add a little bit of water, season the sauce with spices add some ginger and mustered, when I'm done add the sauceon the spaghetti Mix it well.

4329 2018-09-17 15:18:04 A degree is not a degree.

That is, "Elementary Education" (heavily female) is not the same degree as "Chemical Engineer" (heavily male). And in the case of female Chemical Engineers, they are sought after all over the oil and gas industry in the name of keeping the SJWs appeased
4330 2018-09-17 15:18:04 Yeah its really helped me. If your interested I just started with a company CTFO selling CBD oil. The information is on my pinned tweet. Also you can sign up to work there to if you like. No pressure though. I am glad thou that cbd is helping you too. It's really been a blessing
4331 2018-09-17 15:17:51 While you were watching @weatherchannel USA became #1 global crude oil producer. Also, in USA, hydroelectric power #1 source in 19 states and wind #1 in 16 states versus natural gas #1 in 16 states and coal #1 in 18 #Renewables #FossilFuels
4332 2018-09-17 15:17:44 So THC-A oil is legal in Virginia with a doctors note and Hampton roads is most likely gonna have dispensary’s next year. Does this mean my drug charge is getting thrown away and I can stop being on the run 
4333 2018-09-17 15:17:43 just make sure the oil is as hot as the literal sun and try to not open the oven door much!
4334 2018-09-17 15:17:34 These are probably a handful of individuals who wants to be a president of something. If there was no gas/oil, they stay with Ethiopia, drink the waters of Ethiopia and consume its makings. Oh but when there is gas/oil, forget Ethiopia. What a shame.
4335 2018-09-17 15:17:28 That's happening right along the value chain - from mines and oil fields, to resource processing, manufacturing, distribution and services - including finance. The potential for significant leaps in productivity is there - but so are the downsides.

We hv good relationship with Iran, we r still importing oil despite the deadline of sanction from america i.e. 4th Nov 2018
by ur logic, R V supporting Iran in othr matters
Iran Supports Boko Haram Muslim Brotherhood & Houthi rebel.

R V?

4339 2018-09-17 15:17:12 yes I noticed that - future forecasts of IEA have been poor at future tech (just like oil comps) leaving ING loans still at risk of future shock. Esp if we get our act together on Paris

4347 2018-09-17 15:16:37 I don't for sure, but If you notice on the chart, whenever the RSI went oversold and turned up (circles at the top), oil saw a decent pullback (circles at the bottom). I've found this to be a helpful (but not perfect) signal since I've been using it.

4349 2018-09-17 15:16:35 @VoxPodcast @SharePickers Question is does your 'oil & gas specialist' use your platform to promote companies where there is financial incentive to do so ? Notable that many companies, some of whom are 'high profile' are never discussed? Chance of clarity on the topic?

4360 2018-09-17 15:15:52 So....Labour PFI deals to cost Scotland £30 BILLION over next decade; Over £300 Billion of Oil in Scottish waters flushed down the WM drain in last 40 years and Norway STILL raking-in 20 TIMES the oil revenue from N Sea, compared to UK, every year......and it's the SNP's fault???

4376 2018-09-17 15:14:01 So poor people get subsidised kerosene, LPG too. Who is going to pay for subsidy and oil bonds on which interest also have to be paid? Every employed person claims 10% yearly increment so why can't they pay inflation which is less than 4.7% compared to more than 10% in UPA?
4377 2018-09-17 15:13:54 The Witcher:
It was a rainy day in Kaer Morhen. Vesemir was teaching new recruits about  Botchlings. 'Use Cursed Oil against them', he said, 'It'll make your jobs easier'.
4378 2018-09-17 15:13:43 That may be, but in the meantime vast majority of existing ICE service-oriented businesses will transition to EV as apart from oil/gas they still need basics - fuel, repairs, bodywork, parts, insurance. 91% of China's EV charging demand comes from scooters & buses. Add trucks!

4427 2018-09-17 15:08:09 While we definitely encourage experimentation, our testing hasn't given us good results with essential oils--if you want to give it a shot, start with 1oz of oil per pound of wax and go from there.
4428 2018-09-17 15:08:05 Cover in oil and bake for like 45 minutes. It won’t be great at first, so make sure to use more oil. Clean it with hot water and a chain mail scrubber. Also wipe down with paper towels to dry if I’m impatient.

4431 2018-09-17 15:07:40 This was exactly what I thought. What surgery isn’t grim to look at? I’m pretty sure my gallbladder was all kinds of nasty and I doubt my spine was an oil painting. It’s any excuse for the transphobia over there. Which is, to my mind, way uglier to watch than any surgery.

4439 2018-09-17 15:06:53 Why does Notley think oil will be any different. Current suppliers of oil to the Far East will protect their market by slashing their prices on higher quality product requiring less energy to refine it. Send it to eastern Canada where they are importing oil from foreign sources.

I was against it but a lot of people who couldn't afford health insurance got covered because it was mandatory. That's "something." Yes it expanded Medicaid, but people who had their first access to healthcare were probably grateful to have it.

4475 2018-09-17 15:02:17  couldn't resist sorry! When my cat was bunged up though, we put some olive oil with its food and green beans. That soon got it moving again. 
4476 2018-09-17 15:02:08 IMHO, talking about sustainable palm oil is tiptoeing round the issue. Greenpeace should call for a Europe-wide ban on palm oil in processed food. Use home-grown rapeseed oil and sunflower oil, which is what used to happen.

4482 2018-09-17 15:01:34 I actually think we could get the attention of oil companies by picking one to boycott. Just everyone stop using that one for three months or so so they feel it. And then pick another one, etc.

4525 2018-09-17 14:56:23 Today's oil price was $78.60 and the petrol price in Mumbai was Rs 90 per liter. If the oil price increases to $140, the price of petrol will be Rs 160 per liter if BJP's logic is applied. BJP will reduce the prices of petrol just before the elections to get votes.

4571 2018-09-17 14:50:37 @nikkihaley: When we pursued UN designation of the Patriot and other North Korean, Russian, and other country-flagged ships that have been found to be illegally transferring oil, Russia consistently blocked these designations in the sanctions committee #sabcnews
4572 2018-09-17 14:50:35 But, still, you're banging on about oil. You said it's "a bonus", I'm still waiting on you explaining how that is. You just seem to be shouting "squirrel!" louder and louder and showing how little you actually know each time
4573 2018-09-17 14:50:32 Castor oil is da key!
4574 2018-09-17 14:50:30 Use your tea tree oil! Everyday twice a day and don’t let it fall out. Just stop messing w it

4577 2018-09-17 14:50:00 Try to play “Happy Wheels” idk if u know it but heres the thrill if u fails you need to eat 1 tablespoon of chili oil but you dont need to drink milk or water, Once u drink u lost the game. (P.S i tried this once before it lasted me 10 Min. Before drinkin)
4578 2018-09-17 14:49:59 I agree, I'm not energy stocks. I just think a pullback may be in order based on historically what has happened to oil when the RSI went oversold and turned up
4579 2018-09-17 14:49:56 @GuyB look at $TELL. Also doing well- oil/gas stock

4586 2018-09-17 14:48:41 Convincing yourself while convincing your flock to follow you to the swampy snake oil to drink and be marry while the poor and middle class die off one by one.
4587 2018-09-17 14:48:31 Then why is congress protesting now? These protests have nuisance value. It gets some value when over all economy is in shambles. UPA screwed the economy from 2010 onwards. When the oil price increased it came on top of 11% inflation. They dint had any policy response.
4588 2018-09-17 14:48:22 Et vous pensez réellement que les gens en Bretagne ou au Pays Basque ont attendu tranquillement le XVIe -ou la fin du XVIIIe en  Corse- (trois régions ne pratiquant d'ailleurs pas ni langue d'oc, ni langue d'oïl) pour baptiser leurs enfants avec des prénoms traduits du fr. ?

4593 2018-09-17 14:47:39 Do people realize that Zinke & Trump issued a Policy this summer that rules that : 
No private corporation leasing any public lands can be held financially responsible for any damage they cause to those public lands, including OIL SPILLS
4594 2018-09-17 14:47:37 I just looked at the last three years...apples to pumkins? I'm not to sure. 
Being an Oil King fan when admission was a nickle! follow them as closely as a layman can,  I remember Ty Rattie very well, when the game was on the line Ty Rattie would kill ya! He was dangerous!
4595 2018-09-17 14:47:24 This is from August... Read bill 106. Then read this. They're very different because a couple politicians decided their will should trump democracy which overwhelmingly voted for responsible oil and gas production.

4598 2018-09-17 14:47:04 Brexit, talk to me.

Thing is you don’t just jump into bed with Theresa May, you take Theresa May out to lunch, you wine and dine her, you give her an oil massage then she gives up British fishing rights in the North Sea, if you’re lucky.

4601 2018-09-17 14:46:42 Punting the worst government in Canadian history and producing more oil and gas from the most responsible country in the world. We are C Negative you fool.  Why does a Quebec cement plant need No EIA, bombardier and Saudi oil pay no CTax? Hypocrite.  #neverwasready
4602 2018-09-17 14:46:38 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
4603 2018-09-17 14:46:30 Out of which Rs. 70,000 crore was simply interest accrued on the oi bought thru credit.

If UPA bought the oil thru cash, tis wd have been completely unnecessary!!
4604 2018-09-17 14:46:28 you literally, quite literally, just made my point... you can sit down now... and I'll invite you to check up on farm subsidies and oil company tax breaks when you want to research self reliance

4611 2018-09-17 14:45:48 I don't buy that she doesn't have an answer. She's just not willing to share it, and isn't as practiced at hiding it as some other politicians. She'd rather sell snake oil for votes.

Copaiba essential oil : Resin from the Copaiba tree - 55%

4697 2018-09-17 14:35:59 Mine was quinoa, baby spinach, blueberies, strawberries, avocado with chia seeds and homemade dressing of olive oil, honey and lemon.... This is a whole meal. Salads are easy and yummy.

4714 2018-09-17 14:33:32 Did not read the article do not want to . Let's just push for alternatives to oil asap.
4715 2018-09-17 14:33:27 I'd halve them, salt and pepper, and dry them very very very slow and low in the oven. They hugely intensify in flavour and can be kept for months in a little oil in the fridge - use in anything you would use tomatoes in and taste the difference 
4716 2018-09-17 14:33:18 do oil and gas rate down
4717 2018-09-17 14:33:13 What would be the possible positive outcome for Russia taking on the US?

Our military-industrial complex is always spoiling for a fight, & our banking & oil industries are looking for an excuse to break Russia into obedient little pieces.
4718 2018-09-17 14:33:11 Well you gulp oil and gasoline then wash it down with roof water, yell at random super nice ppl, and randomly have sleep overs at the circus.

Do you want to the list of contractors ?

4727 2018-09-17 14:32:17 As soon as fear enters your mind, wisdom departs it. Just as oil and water cant mix, so will wisdom and fear not mix. Thus, when calamity tries to enter your life, remember that only wisdom can deliver you. Refuse to be anxious so that wisdom doesn’t depart from you..

4747 2018-09-17 14:30:47 Oil is just an extra. We can survive and still be better off without subsidising little Englanders. HS2, channel tunnel, M25 and every other thing that's been done south of Watford but enjoy your Brexit as it's going to leave a bad taste in your mouth.

4837 2018-09-17 14:20:02 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
4838 2018-09-17 14:20:02 S/o CBD oil
4839 2018-09-17 14:20:00 I just looked up the worlds largest oil drilling bit.  It is 90cm in diameter.  Radius of the earth, 3,959 miles.  You want to make a 90cm x 637,137,706cm drill bit?  And deal with the pressures at depth?  How relentlessly stupid are you people!
4840 2018-09-17 14:19:58 @UmActuallyShow Um, Actually, it's ok to use soap on cast iron skillets (that's an old wive's tale). The anti-stick coating is the polymerization of the oil when it passes it's smoke point and bonds to the metal on a molecular level and will not be washed off with soap and water.
4841 2018-09-17 14:19:57 80 to 83 is long term supply levels, and even if this breaks will not sustain, perfect case of a bull trap ahead, we do see it heading down towards 65 to 70. On #brent #oil ahead in few month's. Kind regards

4845 2018-09-17 14:19:38 I can FUNCTION on #Oxycodone in addition to the MMJ oil (in a syringe) that I only use a "rice grain" size, on a tiny piece of chocolate. My scoliosis pain is greatly reduced by these combinations. The nerve damage bee sting sensation, requires (3) 5% LIDOCAINE patches qd 12 hrs.

4914 2018-09-17 14:13:11 Price didn't come down because global crude price were on all time high. During this period oil prices were above $100+. Sir at least read my full tweet before selectively picking up what you want to pick up.

4931 2018-09-17 14:12:00 Fuck off with the 1% bullshit narrative.  It’s not the 1%, it’s politicians (most of whom are not in the 1%) and their oil tycoon and weapons contractor cronies.

Just stop with this myopic view of the labyrinth of political corruption. It’s not helping.
4932 2018-09-17 14:11:59 If it's any reassurance, my oil light has been on for a week and I've been driving just fine. It just means it needs an oil change and as long as you aren't neglecting it for long periods of time it'll be okay. Walmarts auto shop can change the oil for you for cheap as well.

4975 2018-09-17 14:08:23 I expect China to withdraw forward physical oil market liquidity from the completely inflated Brent/WTI complex and transfer it to Shanghai. It was control of this complex which enabled Obama to jack up prices in 2009 as massive 'fund' futures positions.

4979 2018-09-17 14:08:03 Worked in the oil industry before turning to politics. Had a masters of economics degree so thinking he’d have invested wisely in the bull market of 2002-2007, and beyond. Name a politician who’s poor? None of them are. Point being, he worked. Unlike PM Trustfund Vacation.

4981 2018-09-17 14:07:58 How about the oil/ oil refining business? All oil change shops done. Most refiners done (gasoline demand gone). Oil filter makers done. Gas pump and parts suppliers done. Oil tanker fleets and drivers done. Tanker manufacturers done. Just the job losses will cause a recession.

4993 2018-09-17 14:06:36 I know, my friend.
But, in the end China didn't deliver the money, because Venezuela must first pay a debt that is pending, so China now agreed to give a deadline to pay and if it pays, only if it pays, it will lend the money and how can Venezuela pay? With oil fiel.

5009 2018-09-17 14:04:26 ignore it if you like son,,the truth is 43% of those you are desperate to be in union with dont give a toss about your union,they would see scots go to keep brexit.
Even 43% of yer union dont want union,they do enjoy you voting to give them scotland oil and gas though
5010 2018-09-17 14:04:16 Not exactly, there per capita income is much more than us, there oil pricing is done on par with global trend(A practice which is going on for decades). India's market pricing is done by OMC on behest of Govt. Totally a different model.
5011 2018-09-17 14:04:07 How do you deal with oil spills, ash run off, beach shutdowns, strip mining, air pollution, sonic blasting, earthquakes, water contamination, or loss of resources?
You can ignore them I guess.
Dealing with the externalities of renewables is better than the status quo.

5035 2018-09-17 14:01:18 Even more impressive if you think that the entire population of North Dakota is only 750.000 while Venezuela is 30.000.000, and a lots of Venezuelan oil goes abroad just to pay debt to China and Cuba, meaning Venezuela doesn't get cash for it.

5043 2018-09-17 14:00:00 Don’t Forget to Keep Your Skin Hydrated 

Your oil glands diminish as you age, resulting in dry skin. Bacteria can easily penetrate dry skin and cause infection. We can see to it that your seniors apply the necessary moisturizers to hydrate their skin.

5054 2018-09-17 13:58:47 China & Russsia have bled dry the easy gold. Now what? The US remains #1--4X more gold. Everyone has oil (now). CNY currency doesn't float that's the REAL issue. Both EU and US have off the books agreement re buying their own debt, $ remains OK. Simple enough: It's East vs. West.

5059 2018-09-17 13:58:13 also, India has been pressurised by USA to reduce oil imports from Iran to zero by November. The cut off in oil imports is nearly half compared to previous year. Oil companies haven't renewed their contracts yet, they're waiting for govt actions.
5060 2018-09-17 13:58:06 That said, Ethiopia is not resource-free, but it lacks oil and is land-locked. There's serious export potential of precious metals, but like land-locked South Sudan, they need a way to get product to market. Then potential for resource curse will kick in, but one would hope not

5118 2018-09-17 13:51:19 I hate having to get my oil changed and that’s exactly what’s on my to do list today. 
5119 2018-09-17 13:51:07 You do know the SNP attacked the OBR for having to low an estimate for future oil prices don't you?

5122 2018-09-17 13:50:48 First, I was born in & spent the last 61 years in Alberta.  We've been calling it the Tar Sands up until about 10 years ago, when somebody decided that "Oil Sands" sounded so much... nicer. Less like pollution.

5124 2018-09-17 13:50:27 I hate the whole, "You know it's fake, right?" or "You like to watch grown men hug each other in spandex and baby oil?" like I'm hearing it for the first time. Not taking in to account it's more real than anything they watch or takes a lot of skill.
5125 2018-09-17 13:50:24 ขอบคุณนะคะ
5126 2018-09-17 13:50:23 I care about things you haven't even considered. I care about a strong dollar, the price of oil, political stability. NONE of which are good AT ALL since Trump.
5127 2018-09-17 13:50:17 The use of unskilled underpaid workers has actually slowed or halted agricultural innovation in many ways. Similar to how cheap oil prevents investment in solar etc technology. Why spend $$ on new ideas for your farm when the guys hiring illegals can undercut you every time.

5141 2018-09-17 13:48:35 In last 16 days Petrol prices have gone up by Rs.3.33/ liter.I think Centre Government must take a note of these increased prices immediately & bring these down by cutting d excise duty and should ask state governments to reduce d VAT.The only way to bring down d prices of oil.
5142 2018-09-17 13:48:32 Fadhnavis wil b askd to cut VAT..i think he wil do it if it touches 95..i am sure before state elctns, they will manage somethg (ask oil Companies to take d heat) to manage perceptions

5154 2018-09-17 13:47:11 Let's say you're right. It will reduce our dependence on foreign oil, reduce traffic and add a couple free hours to your week. You don't have to be a climate change advocate to see some amount of remote work makes sense.
5155 2018-09-17 13:46:46 I'm not sure but I think tea tree oil works well!

5157 2018-09-17 13:46:23 I don't think castor oil is the only thing that will help. My mother used castor oil way back when, so that's why I pointed that out.

I think baking soda, tea oil, or Epsom salt could work too.
5158 2018-09-17 13:46:09 and what is that ground made of? Tar paper? Broken glass? Slick oil? Broken promises? Bibles? His erotic fantasies of women?
5159 2018-09-17 13:45:42 I know. Nonetheless, their oil production has crashed due to their own failure, not because of extraction difficulties.
5160 2018-09-17 13:45:37 I always dread getting a oil change they act like your cars about to blow up and needs service all around

5166 2018-09-17 13:44:32 They have made a mess of things, yes, but 'largest oil reserves in the world' requires a VERY loose definition of 'reserves'. Most of it is oil sand and tar, hard stuff to deal with.

5341 2018-09-17 13:24:00 As long as Canada allows foreign oil to control our exports we will always be a puppet for the USA to manipulate. Pushing a pipeline through would have meant independence and we could actually say that we are oil producers .We need refineries and tidewater access.

5431 2018-09-17 13:13:35 the main factors of our inflation are 1. crude oil - in Sept 2017 on $44/barrel, now it's $78, 2. peso depreciation - in 2012 only P44/$, now P54 and economists said maybe P58
5432 2018-09-17 13:13:30 Yes, we liberally applied hot pepper oil this week in hopes to deter. That seemed to work with our @WildlifeAcoust raccoon issue. We also put out some camera traps to catch the vandal in action.

5485 2018-09-17 13:08:21 True. Venezuela has 2 main industries. Oil and tourism. It's a lovely place. If they had someone in power who used even a portion of the oil proceeds to promote economic development they could flourish.

5528 2018-09-17 13:04:53 What is that you want to know? U asked for Crude oil price. I have given a chart. The crude oil price from 2004 to 2014. When the crude oil in 2004 was only $36, why is the petrol price also equal? Did any idiot question the congress? Or was someone sucking thumb?

5629 2018-09-17 12:54:22 Hi Walt.

5640 2018-09-17 12:53:10 Maybe because those of us that drive EVs know how good they are, and want manufacturers to hurry up and make EV versions of their cars? Also, as far as power goes, remember to add in all the power used to pump, ship and refine oil. That's why EVs are cleaner, period.
5641 2018-09-17 12:53:08 Happy to see this. The average Canadian needs to be learn more about this topic. Oilsands industry has been villified by the media. It's remarkable how we can make oil from this sandy deposit.

5660 2018-09-17 12:50:54 Great chart. Try thinking. Obama regulations shut off oil+gas known reserves never mind exploration. 
The ACA money suck is off+you should look at key economic factors. Do some real research+I advise you to be a force for good instead of a disruptive influence.

5671 2018-09-17 12:49:38 The idea is: it was the same Sceince at that time:  One group denied, the other found oil in massive quantities.
5672 2018-09-17 12:49:32 I should REALLY schedule an oil change tho someone hold me accountable
5673 2018-09-17 12:49:29 Looks like oil will be flowing before October, don't you think?
5674 2018-09-17 12:49:22 Data is the oil of the 21st century. But oil is just useless thick goop until you refine it into fuel.

5693 2018-09-17 12:46:56 I support the hydrogen technology over others, but the claims in the story are not accurate:
1- what is the source of hydrogen? It is has to oil or gas

2- zero emissions only in operating the train, but not when you count hydrogen production

5723 2018-09-17 12:43:16 Indeed Chris...though would still be replacement for oil. Ultimately could be natural gas reforming with carbon capture, or electrolysis with renewable electricity
5724 2018-09-17 12:43:03 Marci Rossell: 2017 is first example of synchronized global growth in a post-crisis world. Why? She holds that new US oil production has made oil prices a stabilizer rather than source of volatility. #AICPAbanks
5725 2018-09-17 12:42:55 thank you for your reassurance!! the new oil is because (my) concern that we’re completely empty but yes totally an oil change is a must!!

5733 2018-09-17 12:42:14 Teach yourself how to use the dip stick to measure how much oil there is. any reputable oil place will give you a sticker with a recommendation on how many miles the car should be at when you should get another oil change. You can add a little oil in between if you’re running low
5734 2018-09-17 12:42:08 Oh, we noticed.  We see it every day in every store.  Food, gas utilities.  Maybe YOU don't see it but we do and will remember in November.  Oil barrel prices have dropped but gas is going up?  What is that about? We noticed the cost..daily. Stop lying. Stop gloating!
5735 2018-09-17 12:41:58 The choice in 2019 is simple: if you hear anyone who is talking about big government and with an oil mindset just blank that person.....they don’t mean well for you.

5748 2018-09-17 12:40:37 I'm in no dispute with you on US production; however that extra production, even if 20mbpd, cannot sack #OPEC. You do realise that #US Oil-Major are not routing to sell oil below $60pb, do you? My point is that #US production CANNOT meet entire world's demand; so #OPEC stays.

5750 2018-09-17 12:40:25 You didn't read the sources on the graphs, did you ...?! They REAL GDP data shows the drop-off in "local GDP" (not our exports, which HAVE grown a lot (some via £crash, as contracts are in $/€, e.g. oil exports)).

5755 2018-09-17 12:39:48 No I think you’re fine!! From my experience the light comes on with time for you to drive to a station, etc. I would say if the oil light is on you should get an oil change not put new oil in though! Adding more oil should be fine for now but get it changed soon!

5946 2018-09-17 12:15:37 Where I live it's mainly ag and oil, and both have been suffering over the last 3 or 4 years, unemp is high, as a result the rideshare is oversaturated, so strategy is required in order to make any money at it. Many drivers commute to LA to work, and then LA gets oversaturated.

5957 2018-09-17 12:13:44 These areas are close to Iran, where the geological faullines reside, hence higher potential of earthquakes. Could write a Phd thesis about this being just a misconception. the fracturing here is 1/1000000th scale to that being conducted in US shale basins or Canada’s sand oil.

5986 2018-09-17 12:09:47 I agree. Oil & gas is not an infinite resource. 

So what's the answer. Renewable energy or nuclear. A long way to go for both. 

But come a serious crisis, 3rd world countries who rely on firewood & wells will survive.

What would happen in Sydney if the power & water stopped?

6000 2018-09-17 12:07:30 Surely if the cars and power stations are going to burn oil anyway why not recycle the plastic, which originated from oil, probably. At least it gets rid of the plastic and makes use of it in the process.

Recycle into? 

Convert into

Recycle as

6040 2018-09-17 12:02:26 Inflation is not just a macro-economic indicator. In common parlance it is unaffordable prices. Modi kept the prices high when oil prices were low & even higher when they actually became close to historical averages. $ is up because exports are dead!

She also got raw carrots frequently, between 2 and 4 each day, it was her favorite, even above all the meat treats

6113 2018-09-17 11:54:12 I've tried CBD oil twice for my RA and it didn't reduce the pain at all. Tried rubbing it on the affected joints, eating it, and sublingually too. No pain relief.
6114 2018-09-17 11:54:11 ぜひ～(*´∀｀)
6115 2018-09-17 11:54:00 Oil you scalp or mix oil with aloe Vera juice
6116 2018-09-17 11:53:58 Please go away and keep whatever is left of your dignity intact.  We had 8 long yrs of this snake oil salesman and his corruption.  You are the reason for this countrys current woes.  Youre an embarassment.

6118 2018-09-17 11:53:28 Without the military option on the table, Maduro has zero motivation to leave by peaceful means.  Oil revenue plus drug trafficking will make his situation viable if they can one way or another get rid of 5 to 10 million Venezuelans. Don't forget Mao is Maduro's hero.

6130 2018-09-17 11:51:14 Soup is good this time of year, I made one with butternut squash, tomato and pepper which is quite healthy but any vegetable soup isn't too bad unless there's lots of oil or starch added
6131 2018-09-17 11:51:05 For sure. Not that they don’t know what to do but r too lazy and complacent to do the right thing. If crude oil is substituted for clearner Energy,Nigeria and Angola will be in deep mess.
6132 2018-09-17 11:51:05 Oh point well taken. Just don't see humanity abandoning hydro anytime in the near future, it's a pretty solid technology, innovation on the generation/transmission side continues. Coal and oil however well the writings on the wall

6143 2018-09-17 11:49:58 Oil. Lots of leave in conditioner and oil. Brush through. Add more. Then dry on a medium warm setting, and towards the end a cool setting. If it still goes wrong, shampoo out and scuff in to a ponytail
6144 2018-09-17 11:49:49 No we wouldn't its your WM Government would fix it so we didnt last time project fear. . They need us too much. Ask yourself why they are so keen for us to stay?  If we were such a burden and no oil/.whisky we would be long gone.

6155 2018-09-17 11:48:50 Growth also took a huge hit in 2014, wonder about reexports, and which service sectors most relevant. For example, oil service growth in Kazakhstan would make sense, but not be big diversification of trade.
6156 2018-09-17 11:48:30 Fucking Jintsuu why wont you drop my oil is finite
6157 2018-09-17 11:48:12 Candles, essential oil diffusing, breathing and just laying down listening to calming music usually helps - good luck.

6162 2018-09-17 11:47:41 North Dakota is now pumping as much oil as #Venezuela.  Those are the fruits of socialism for that formerly proud country.
6163 2018-09-17 11:47:34 I just started crying in the service waiting area while getting an oil change because the news is playing stories about a 26 year old boy who died because of a shark attack yesterday!?!?!!!?!!! HELLO????? THIS IS LITERALLY MY GREATEST FUCKING FEAR

6173 2018-09-17 11:46:17 We have had "wars for oil" ...
in the future we'll have "wars for water" ...
Water is the most essentials resource ... unfortunately "drinking" water is in scarce supply ...
6174 2018-09-17 11:46:15 Didn't fix anything?  That's irrelevant when it comes to socialism.
6175 2018-09-17 11:46:07 Yeah where are the clips so we can watch/rub oil on ourselves?

6184 2018-09-17 11:45:05 It's gonna be a long day of truck maintenance and doctor's appointments.

Right now, I'm sitting in Wally World getting the oil changed and tires rotated. Then, it's off to my mechanic to see how much the next bit will cost. 

Follow that up with a trip to the VA in PGH.

Joy!

6193 2018-09-17 11:43:41 The pseudo point is interesting. The strict control in Australia dried up domestic production for a while which resulted in a change in the improtation of finished ATS. Then after a while pseudo became valuable in its own right like safrol oil for MDMA.

Your supplier claimed they could not get down the lane, despite oil being delivered here for the last 25 years. No evidence has been provided that they were ever here. Please either fulfil this order or make an immediate refund.

6202 2018-09-17 11:42:57 ........... In addition to being skeptical about the existence of climate change, Dr. Spencer also doubts the theory of evolution, believing in "Intelligent Design” . So he is backed by Heartland (OIL& GAS), and the infamous George Marshall Institute (OIL & GAS). See a pattern?

6247 2018-09-17 11:35:13 Might be peanut oil. More expensive, but worth it.
6248 2018-09-17 11:35:06 Can you please send me the details of the product please? Id be interested to research; Id read in some research the ancillary ingredients, not the oil, are the things that help.

6267 2018-09-17 11:33:25 Forcing a 100 year old fuel type into the future is a no go. It can be replaced with elephant poo, solar, wind whatever. There is no economic case for oil anymore. It's dead.

6307 2018-09-17 11:27:13 So the govt starts taking painfully-necessary measures. Smartly, the gas prices increased slab-wise, lesser for poor lower/middle class. Rationalised for commercial rates to reflect ground realities of high RLNG rates when oil prices are higher.

Is Sasol now just feeding off increased fuel prices for the benefit of shareholders?

6422 2018-09-17 11:13:35 Any compromise in fuel pricing of India 4 consumer would set the stage for increased govt borrowing and a deteriorating debt profile. But it would not allow for a major reduction of local oil demand.

6438 2018-09-17 11:11:39 As money is fungible, this is ultimately a subsidy to EV manufacturers (not just Tesla). This is a far more sensible way to spend tax payers money than to subsidize polluters or even pay for geopolitics of controlling oil supplies in Middle East.
6439 2018-09-17 11:11:37 It  makes no sense exporting doctors in a country where many people can't access health care. Its  the same as exporting crude oil to import refined petroleum products. thats why you have many Nigerians traveling to India, to access healthcare they couldn't get here!

6683 2018-09-17 10:35:42 Et en même temps ils annoncent l’augmentation régulière des taxes sur le gars oil et l’essence taxe qui empêchent la mobilité
6684 2018-09-17 10:35:39 Mine is an 07. I made sure it had a tune up and an oil change before I drove it off the lot.
6685 2018-09-17 10:35:28 Whyyy am I awake so early on my day off?! To make it worse, I just realized I just watched this entire fish oil infomercial.

6699 2018-09-17 10:33:33 I maintain, not so much civil war, although the definition does seem to fit the claim...much rather Lawlessness - speaks to the moral decay across the board - like oil flowing down from the head to the toe, so does moral decay come to ruin all in all - all fall victim, good / bad
6700 2018-09-17 10:33:29 They could care less. He plans to purge most of the population and sell off most of the land to rich Russians and Chinese and Oil companies. He doesn't care about lost jobs cause he knows his plans to kill off or get rid of 2/3 of the population.

6705 2018-09-17 10:32:46 Same thing happened to russia.  There GDP has dropped 11% since 2012.  There dollar still hasn't recovered.  Its still only 70% of where it was.  They're economy is energy based as well.  Oil and gas.
6706 2018-09-17 10:32:30 Agreed, it can if not careful.  Jonathan also messed us up after he wasted billions of dollars he shared amongst governors. That would have being saved for the raining day when oil price is down.
6707 2018-09-17 10:32:13 Find me an example of when the producers grow smaller.  And if you say Venezuela... wrong.  They're not lazy, there entire economy was built on 1 thing.  Oil.  That's what killed them.  Not because people were laxy.  Bc oil prices dropped in half and there dollar tanked bc of it.
6708 2018-09-17 10:32:09 Trump's Infrastructure Plan:

6714 2018-09-17 10:31:39 Taylor is breaking almost every attendance record of the stadiums this tour. Proves how huge she is.

6718 2018-09-17 10:31:01 Sir, it would be great if you hold a press conference/mann ki baat, to nullify all the allegations that the opposition is leveling at the Govt. of India viz Rafale, Mallya, Oil Prices to name the prominent ones. A humble request. @PMOIndia @narendramodi @AmitShah @BJP4India

6753 2018-09-17 10:25:40 Really true. Muhammar Kaddafi was surely better than seven year of civil war, thousand of deaths, and immigration sparkl. France and Gb started the hunt to Kaddafi to get oil fields only. UN has repeated a big mistake.

6805 2018-09-17 10:19:34 Yeah our budget is very low. Somehow Nigeria decided to depend on oil revenue, oil revenue per person is very low. There’s a burning need to increase tax collection. How do you propose to do that?

6811 2018-09-17 10:18:03 And you produce great results. The run home in January 1982 was something special too. Never been faster through Finsbury Park. What oil do you use nowadays, by the way?
6812 2018-09-17 10:17:59 credit for this goes to our govt/system/oil companies?
6813 2018-09-17 10:17:50 Core CPI inflation rate down to 2.2% y/y during August. 
It's ranging between 1.6%- 2.4% since 2012. Upward pressure 
on the PPI finished goods inflation rate since early 2016, which is also visible in the CPI goods inflation rate. Uptrend attributable to the surge in oil prices.
6814 2018-09-17 10:17:37 かわい~!
6815 2018-09-17 10:17:35 But he’s not doing that. Deficit, tax cuts, budget shortfalls, stock markets been flat for 8 months. Oil prices going up. Stagnant wages. Raising interest rates and inflation. All from Trump not putting policies in place to continue what obama left him. A rising economy.

6973 2018-09-17 09:49:36 Canola oil has the highest smoke point oil which makes it an ideal choice for deep frying because it can be heated to a higher temperature (smoke point -450 °F). This results in less oil retention in the fried foods.

7103 2018-09-17 09:28:27 No we will not destroy the planet. We will, however, destroy all the exquisite life forms on earth that have evolved over millions of years. That sounds like an atrocity to me. Tragically, it's easy to fix. All that has stopped action is the corrupting influence of oil industry $

7105 2018-09-17 09:27:34 Coconut oil ang talagang mabisa pag grabe na. It's the only thing the cured mine nung high school. Yung homemade pa yun kaya mainit-init pa pinapahid na. Very soothing. Better with drops of tea tree oil. Ta's ordinary shampoo & conditioner na lang.
7106 2018-09-17 09:27:18 He's a lying, nasty snake oil seller! Backtracked from the 350m for the NHS 10 minutes after the referendum result was confirmed, now claims  hardworking people voted leave knowing they might put their families through hardship for 'political' gains!
7107 2018-09-17 09:27:07 @VP the Iranian regime is really stupid, thinking that Europe can help them, Europe has no strength. The nuclear deal is over a few months, and all sanctions will be enforced, and you see oil exports to zero by November,
7108 2018-09-17 09:27:07 Wow, you sir are a true product of the American education system, taught to obey and never question nor think for himself, you would make your masters proud. Russia played no part in the illegal invasion of Iraq. The USA invaded Iraq to get control of all that oil

7135 2018-09-17 09:22:38 The most common cause of solidification Vegetable Oil (Palm based) is low temperatures during the cold season.

Of this, there is no doubt.
7137 2018-09-17 09:22:19 The only thing we'd have left to restart our economy would be to start tapping the the oil & gas reserves we've intentionally been keeping untapped...

7167 2018-09-17 09:15:15 So even if you are right and let’s just say World notorious Afghan warlords have learnt to become normal humans, would you agree with a state policy of throwing out nationalities to foreigners esp to those from a hostile country, esp when you have scarce resources yourself.

7171 2018-09-17 09:13:43 It is not about fighting it. It is about stopping doing something that will likely lead to the end of life on earth. It is the moral imperative of our generation. It is an easy thing to do. All that has stopped it is pressure from the power oil lobby.
7172 2018-09-17 09:13:43 Similar with tomatoes. 1/4 toms, crush salt over, add crushed garlic clove, stir and leave. Salt extracts juice from flesh. Prep rest of salad

Last thing, pick out garlic clove, add torn basil & whisk in olive oil, check  seasoning.

Amazing over big, hot, buttery croutons.
7173 2018-09-17 09:13:28 A useless question, every Nation has it's resources. If Biafra wants to stand on its on what will be it's own resources of survival. As we all know oil is the wealth of Nigeria..  What will Biafra stand on

7220 2018-09-17 09:05:19 Sounds like big oil is attacking not only science and scientists, but also environmentalists. Evangelicals don’t respect biblical scholars and experts. Evangelical Christians prefer to misinterpret the Bible due to lack of historical and linguistic knowledge.

7237 2018-09-17 09:01:52 Quite. For example many years ago before we joined the #EU I remember olive oil was something exotic which you bought in tiny wee bottles from the chemist.

7243 2018-09-17 09:00:49 Start developing jobs with alternative forms of energy production not the building of pipelines. Oil is a 19th century resource. Look to Costa Rica, Iceland and countless other examples. @DavidSuzuki #cdnpoli

7278 2018-09-17 08:55:31 the 15% paid upfront for EPC was supposedly drawn from the energy fund which
energy fund was also capitalised by oil related revenue, shouldn't this money have gone to the Petroleum fund instead.
So am still wondering where the actual taxes I pay like VAT,PAYe are at?

7280 2018-09-17 08:55:19 The way I see it is if the Oil are offering $3M but are probably willing to go up given Morrissey's deal (maybe $3.25M) and the Nurse camp value him at $4M but are willing to come down and start at $3.8M. 

It probably comes in around where Joseph is guessing, which I'm ok with.
7281 2018-09-17 08:55:07 There is a trading element with semi conductor companies. A lot of bears makes money shorting them short term. Long term investors hold forever which is good as there are plenty of room to grow compared to Oil companies. You consider shorting them by soxs time to time to max it.

7326 2018-09-17 08:47:19 Even oil rich countries like oman and dubai are charging their citizens with approx Rs 24/litre of petrol. So if we can manage to keep the prices at Rs 40/litre, it will be helping us in many ways.
7327 2018-09-17 08:47:09 5. I hope there is method to the madness of indigo

7356 2018-09-17 08:41:28 You wouldn't think the UK is a long time oil producer. Or that the treasury pulls in about 750 billion every year from all taxes. They happily shovel money at the EU and 'foreign aid' but not to our drivers. Miles is right about EVs - we will be screwed too soon enough. Cretins!

If you want him to stop searching & change his thinking that wouldn’t helpful.

7384 2018-09-17 08:36:42 Bro, the metro construction in Bangalore has largely to do with Oil tax Or an expressway to drive  your 10L Car. Effectively Petrol has gone up by 5-6 rs in 5 yrs.Its better to tax this to construct a Metro that improves everybody Quality of life than have no space to drive a car
7385 2018-09-17 08:36:34 Oil is only 7% of our GDP .

7393 2018-09-17 08:35:14 I 100% agree. I don't don't usually eat isolated fats, but I have a bottle of extra virgin oil and cold pressed irish wild flax oil which I would use very rarely.

7395 2018-09-17 08:35:02 What kinda oil? Also tryna grow out my nails
7396 2018-09-17 08:34:47 Absolutely.  It is in our national interest to build refineries in Canada as well as national pipelines from coast to coast to coast.  Unless you support wasting $40 million every day on unethical oil imports from the Saudi regime and other unethical producers with zero enviro.
7397 2018-09-17 08:34:36 Interesting Slate Money podcast episode with @bethanymac12 & her take on the USA strategy to pump as much oil as possible, instead is thinking long-term. Funny no one on the show  mentioned that country with the largest reserves and dwindling production.

7425 2018-09-17 08:28:56 I’d add Nixon to the list as he is the POTUS that allowed privatization of healthcare.

7430 2018-09-17 08:28:18 Republicans believed bullshit conspiracy theories on climate change for years because big oil denied man made climate change and right wing personalities repeated the lies. Now that almost all big oil companies openly admit man made climate change is real, they feel stupid.

7486 2018-09-17 08:16:54 It's a good idea, Norway did a similar thing when oil was found in the 80s, instead of spending it on political bribes for short term power, the Norwegians created a wealth fund out the profits, they now have a globally influential fund worth over a trillion dollars.

Refine .. to cut on freight and premium ...a small drop.

7515 2018-09-17 08:11:13 Russia did not obliterate Libya and take over it's oil fields and open the gates to uncontrollable immigration from the African Continent to the EU. Neither did Russia destabilize Iraq, Afghanistan or Syria for the same reasons. Have you evidence of Putin's funding?

7517 2018-09-17 08:10:50 Just shaking my head at the dollars and the fact that it's come to this for a non-proven guy.  Yes, the #Oil need him, & the Owners/GMs offer $ to the players, but geez, we talk about lockouts and here is an excellent case to discuss on why it's headed that direction again.
7518 2018-09-17 08:10:48 I thought Turkey was a major source of funding & illegal oil shipments.

7525 2018-09-17 08:09:46 Congress Era Oil bonds loan is the reason why government can’t cut taxes on petroleum products so now whom to blame.

7553 2018-09-17 08:03:53 @narendramodi
A Progressive Crude Oil Pricing system should be applied:
1.Reduced or Half Price for Buses and Goods Carraige  vehicles 
2.Proportionate increase for 2 & 4 wheelers accordingly on the basis of their CC to find a substantial compensation for the above reduction.
7554 2018-09-17 08:03:44 You still need to moisturize your skin daily. Instead of a thick cold cream, you can use almond or extra virgin olive oil to moisturize without blocking pores. #skincareroutine #moisturise #almondoil
7555 2018-09-17 08:03:43 RaGa is gaining traction and want to loot the respect of janta. The present Govt is cheating you by not passing benefit of cheap oil and is looting from you in keeping high price of petrol and diesel. You better understand this truth. Do not be prey of propaganda.

7562 2018-09-17 08:02:20 Global oil prices edged up from early losses on Monday despite assurances from Washington that Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United States can raise output fast enough to offset falling supplies from Iran and elsewhere.
7563 2018-09-17 08:02:11 Wind&Solar require 100% 24/7 on-tap fully-staffed baseload (nuke,gas,coal,oil) backup needed. Kinda expensive. Very unreliable (when the wind doesn't blow [or blow hard enough or too hard] or the sun doesn't shine, like EVERY NIGHT!).
7564 2018-09-17 08:01:58 Iran is interested in maintaining high prices possibly as its supplies will as it is be curtailed.
OPEC has to heed world's need as also USA's advice as US today, with shale gas, is one of the world's largest producers of oil/gas and can by increasing production, upend OPEC!

7648 2018-09-17 07:46:48 Is it a dramatic drop, the vote was in June 16, so GDP growth at the same level? The economy has an infinite amount of variables, price of oil, upward trend in interest rates, it's a lazy claim used for political expedience, with no proof.

Large oil companies are also making large investments into renewables.

7700 2018-09-17 07:36:47 I was thinking that when one of us, Tweeps, are sick we can visit them with 10 kg of Rice, 3 kg of sugar, 2 loaves of bread, 5 litres  of cooking oil, airtime and cash amounting to R5000. If we all agree to my suggestion we can start tomorrow, I'm not feeling well. 
7701 2018-09-17 07:36:25 I heard around 40% of income (on avg), which means farmers get into the black numbers. Without those EU subs Sco farming would already be dead and UK would have to import even more food.

That’s only second best because of thennature of the gas. New infrastructure costs a lot.
Why not use Diesel engines with biofuel then (such as waste cooking oil or sustainably produced fresh oil)?
Priegnitzer Eisenbahn did that, they just got taken over and it finished.

7780 2018-09-17 07:19:24 Crude Rate = Variable

Agreed.

Can we not Fix the Money that Govt will earn from Tax on Oil as a Fixed, Instead of a % ? 

Isn't govt (state and central) making more money when Petrol/Diesel rates are high?

7837 2018-09-17 07:08:10 Completely agree. The US needs to take more interest in electric cars and other forms that ween us off oil, especially for transportation, a huge sector.

7913 2018-09-17 06:54:23 Give me tax relief and I will sell petrol, diesel for Rs 35-40 per litre, claims Baba Ramdev : We should discourage people from lavishly using Petrol & Diesel, as most of it is from imported crude oil, which cause huge "deficit" in trading a/c. Hence I support Modiji in this.

8059 2018-09-17 06:22:08 @OfficialNDCGh in government also faced many external factors outside its control--a few: meltdown of the BRIC economies from 2014 to 2016 led to fall in global demand and fall in commodity prices; compounded by "shale gas" wars and collapse in crude oil prices in 2015 and 2016

8063 2018-09-17 06:20:01 I’m gonna oil and brush this happy head of mine. Hopefully it’ll look better than what it does.
8064 2018-09-17 06:19:50 People are at their worst when you're between them, and something they feel entitled to.

Feeling entitled frees them of restraint in what they do to get their way.

Oil money's like that.

They don't want to let it go, so rationalize not having to by denial, or other means.

8076 2018-09-17 06:17:10 Why not diversify away from oil entirely? The future of oil is not as rosy as it's past/present, all considered on a decades-long timeline.

8086 2018-09-17 06:13:46 Interestingly, OPEC Chief Barkindo just noted that in the medium to long term, the demand for oil will face significant headwinds due to "extraneous factors" over which producers have no control.
8087 2018-09-17 06:13:41 Yep, but too much oil less healthier.
8088 2018-09-17 06:13:27 ECONOMIC INDICATORS: 17 September @ 8:00 
The dollar is trading at R14,93, the euro at R17,37 and the British pound at R19,53. Gold is selling at $1194,88 a fine ounce and Brent crude oil is quoted at $77,52 a barrel.

8095 2018-09-17 06:12:01 And the changes in the global market are largely due to the American shale oil boom as the US has become a swing producer. With Canada producing about 5% of the global supply, we are not in a position to influence the market and we're also price-takers.

8097 2018-09-17 06:11:50 Dairy Crest expects H1 revs “slightly ahead” of last year, driven by strong demand in Cathedral City and Clover. Frylight expected weaker due to weather hitting oil usage, though trading is improving. Net debt significantly lower following May equity issue. FY guidance unchanged.
8098 2018-09-17 06:11:44 Also that analogy is wrong. Look at how the supply of holofuel works. It is very much not like oil.
8099 2018-09-17 06:11:19 We also almost never understand the consequences of our decisions, until long after we make them, which makes for uncertain futures.

Most of all, we get attached to expectations, and sacrifice people to realize them.

Oil clings to relevance because of all the money sunk in it.

8102 2018-09-17 06:11:14 Dan perlu diakui lagi, pengusaha2 palm oil Indo kurang mau kompromi sama standar global yang makin tinggi (lihat notulensi rapat RSPO)

Emang yang kek gini nih, selain perlu ditekan sama masyarakat, pemerintahnya jg harus ada political will untuk naikin standar indo

8114 2018-09-17 06:09:15 Although perlu diakui, ISPO standarnya kurang ketat klo dibandingkan standar versi global, Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil.

8130 2018-09-17 06:06:08 In the 50s and 60s my way ahead of her time mum was buying olive oil from the chemist to make salad dressing with lemon juice. She read Elizabeth David’s cook books! We ate a lot of salads and very little processed food. I was very lucky!

8147 2018-09-17 06:01:14 I honestly have no clue what the point is... they cut jobs to save money for the bottom lines. Global corrections started by the saudis by opening taps to stop shale oil in the US. Ab doesn’t process enough if it’s own oil. Integrated companies do. Ab needs to export to process
8148 2018-09-17 06:00:56 Let it stay this way because they’ll misuse funds just like how they’re doing with the oil

8202 2018-09-17 05:52:02 The money is there with the price of oil. Why aren’t they moving forward? My theory is they want to see who wins the next election first.

8267 2018-09-17 05:42:00 Kindness is not measured in how much money is given in aid. While laudable, it's mere pittance compared to what is extracted from developing countries whose wealth and resources such as oil are constantly plundered by more developed nations. The human cost of oil is staggering.
8268 2018-09-17 05:41:48 America is now the number one oil producer in the world!
8269 2018-09-17 05:41:33 @narendramodi 
Although prices of petrol / Diesel are high it is  good
1. People will use oil wisely.  
2. Low Carbon emission.
3. Low Global Warming
4. High use of Public Transport.
5. Motivation to use Cycle.
6. Government is getting revenue for social work.

8330 2018-09-17 05:28:38 Baby oil is made of mineral oil. Mineral oil is something completely foreign to the human body. It is a synthetic oil which is a byproduct of the distillation of gasoline from crude oil.

8339 2018-09-17 05:28:04 Italian prosecutors allege that, of the total $1.3bn fee paid by Shell and Eni for the oil field, $1.1bn went not into the the accounts of former oil minister Dan Etete who then distributed hundreds of millions to well-connected individuals, including ex-pres. Goodluck  Jonathan.

8359 2018-09-17 05:25:14 You are dead wrong there.  I can show you just as many who disagree. 

Ok, so let's see.

Let's shut down coal, oil and gas production.
While China has 18+ new coal mines being no built etc..
It's not fair for us Americans.  You see this right? 
We want a level playing field.

8364 2018-09-17 05:25:03 Then you should grasp that oil & gas are energy dense STORED energy.
Wind/solar aren’t - as useful as a two legged dog.
Even stoneage fuel of wood, peat & dung is superior as it has its energy stored & so able to deliver its power on demand.
8365 2018-09-17 05:24:36 I find it hard to believe it how a highly sought after oil company cannot sustain itself after paying 20% oil royalty to oil producing states..80% oil revenues plus other overseas projects

Sekedar koreksi, bahwa abiotic/benda mati = tak terbaharukan. Dalam hal ini minyak bumi, menurut "kaum" pendukung teori "unrenewable source"/abiotic oil theory.

8388 2018-09-17 05:21:15 If you would have a bit of research, you would know why..
Crude oil price in 2013 was $105.87/barrel
Now in 2018, $69.02/barrel. Even crude oil prices are so low, petrol prices are increasing everyday!

Benarkah asal minyak bumi dr fosil?

8465 2018-09-17 05:08:06 @pgarrett is an excellent musician, I  like midnight oil but everytime he goes into politics he must have had some weed, acid or white power, just hallucinating and saying bullshit #auspol
8466 2018-09-17 05:08:04 Oil field trash is what we’re called. Lol
8467 2018-09-17 05:08:03 Because oil prices increased and Turkish lira crashed triggering an outflow of foreign capital from all emerging markets causing increment of cad leading to depreciation of rupee

8471 2018-09-17 05:07:28 Jones is anything but a wacko. He knows how to steer his gullible audience to sell his snake oil, even if that means they do his dirty work such as harass and threat anyone who represents an idea contrary to his.

8480 2018-09-17 05:05:03 Nobody is suggesting not using oil at all. There will always be a need for oil. Fact is, though, we should be using much less.
8481 2018-09-17 05:04:58 Anyone know how many drops of essential oil to put into a candle when making your own soy candles?

8491 2018-09-17 05:03:31 You and the boys at the MAGA think-tank sure are burning the midnight oil (and likely a heap of meth) to deliver that triumph of logic.  Don't stop now. #Winning?

8506 2018-09-17 04:58:09 Sure. Instead of building a multi billion nuclear plant, it could be reasonable if we directed such funds and energy to an oil refinery

8509 2018-09-17 04:57:59 I saw someone fry a Twinkie at a fair here once. As if twinkies aren’t bad enough, they dipped it in hot oil and then put whipped cream on top of it. I could feel my arteries harden just watching it. And there was a line a mile long!

8511 2018-09-17 04:57:37 It's not just soyabean, every refined oil is harmful. Kachchi ghani (traditional wooden mill) ka oil is the way forward. Refined oils undergo various chemical and mechanical processes which destroys all the nutrients present in the oil completely before bottling.

8514 2018-09-17 04:57:12 Uhhhh that’s not really how your major supermarkets get your produce from though. All of our food systems are pretty flawed unless you’re growing everything independently on your own land. Going vegan doesn’t stop big oil companies or large toxic factories or plastic production.

8517 2018-09-17 04:56:59 If they keep duties low/even subsidise as the opposition party seems to be suggesting, it blows a hole in the government's long term finances, especially since India doesnt produce a lot of its own oil. 0.7 mb/d and a declining profile, vs. 4.3 mb/d of demand and growing.

8525 2018-09-17 04:55:22 Castor oil is heavy oil so your low prosperity hair won't absorb it, it will just sit on top of the hair. You can use light oils such as argan oil, grapeseed oil and sweet almond oil.
8526 2018-09-17 04:55:21 it may be overproducing oils that you’re not putting back into your body idk lmao i read that somewhere so try moisturizing a little more often and see if it helps? there’s also oil absorbing sheets that will pick up excess oil but leave your makeup on

by pulling out of the Paris Agreement and shredding rules against poisoning our air and water.
8547 2018-09-17 04:50:42 Please, then, when you return, provide me with peer-reviewed studies that prove that chelation and detox are miracle cures.  There are also only four states in the US where CBD oil can be prescribed to autistic children.

Also, if they "couldn't speak", how do they speak "again"?

8562 2018-09-17 04:46:21 If you can’t make it from scratch, you can’t cook. Stirring up oil, water, & an egg with premade ingridents & heating it up, is not cooking
8563 2018-09-17 04:46:13 Have you got any jojoba oil or coconut oil (or any carrier oil)? Try using some of that on a cotton ball or tissue to gently wipe over your eye.
8564 2018-09-17 04:46:10 Oh my Sam just poured the sauted garlic pepper concoction onto the puddle of oil on the cookie sheet and put it in the oven #BB20
8565 2018-09-17 04:46:06 CBD oil has been effective in children who also have seizures along with autism, or those who are violent and/or extremely self-injurious.  It's not for all autistic individuals since it works on different parts of the brain that might not be affected by autism.
8566 2018-09-17 04:46:00 It really annoys me when they deliberately spread lies like this rather actually giving us an informed debate. Sure the dollar has dropped and oil prices have gone up but no all Labour!
8567 2018-09-17 04:45:58 its almost one and i really wanna cook one of these porkchops we got on the skillet with olive oil and seasoning but theyre for dinner sometime and i think my mom would get mad at me. Its happened before

8575 2018-09-17 04:44:00 Drink lots of water and irrigate your sinuses with sterile saline (assuming you have nose/ear/throat issue/s.) Oil pulling helps but not as much as rest and fluids/water. Don't forget to eat light meals somehow in between naps and chugging water.
8576 2018-09-17 04:43:50 US 10-year climbs to near 3% further weighing on Asian currencies. Oil prices eased on concerns that the US is poised to impose additional tariffs on China, outweighing ongoing supply fears.
8577 2018-09-17 04:43:47 And with oil it's only resource, apart from silicon. Another interesting country is Bhutan with Gross National Happiness as its measure of wealth.
8578 2018-09-17 04:43:42 Tax money is not distributed evenly to the people it is being extracted from the people and syphoned to the elite class via corporations, the war machine, Big oil, Big Pharma and private prisons.

8591 2018-09-17 04:40:32 That's someone else's term. Zionists opposed the Brits for failing to carry out the Mandate honestly and fairly, and for their bias in favour of the Arabs.

8742 2018-09-17 04:14:50 It shouldn't be polarizing, it's just a word that people who are overly sensitive take offense to. The tar sands had been known as just that for a very long time before the oil industry decided it needed to "rebrand" itself.

8746 2018-09-17 04:14:17 Biggest problem with switching is the fact that there's so much big oil money mixed up in politics -- that and our current infrastructure doesn't really support a rapid transition from ICE to electric.

8749 2018-09-17 04:14:08 First they support the bigotry & help sell snake oil.  Then they rue the consequences of bigots practicing their faith.  Meanwhile the Gods that be continue to be revered as before.
8750 2018-09-17 04:13:48 Agree, except that Exxon is hardly alone in owning the US. They actually haven’t been doing as well as they once did. People who can perceive reality know the oil industry has to shrink by at least 97% in the next few decades.

8882 2018-09-17 03:55:22 @GoldmanSachs says "India’s world-beating economic expansion.. now faces tests from higher oil prices and a tumbling rupee"
 prices of crude and currency are the common factors for all. Why don't it see the bright spots in India which are sui generis. Analysts are opaque?

9011 2018-09-17 03:35:08 Yep another power play. Just to keep Putin in ck . That's why trump approved all out oil production or his appointees. It's all good letting countries that there is a new sheriff in town. So far I'm liken what I see. I also lived in Germany so I know what they think us too.
9012 2018-09-17 03:35:02 This bathbomb has coconut oil and glitter in it oh my I am in bath heaven rn. Even though I’m allergic to epsom salt
9013 2018-09-17 03:35:00 Interesting question!
The increase in both number & severity of hurricanes in the not so distant future IS IN FACT Trump’s fault
Trump’s greedy policies that cater to fossil fuel industries WILL increase global warming!

There is no “clean coal”

9016 2018-09-17 03:34:46 The really history making move would be to divest from the oil industry, concentrate on public education, and invest in greener technologies.
9017 2018-09-17 03:34:41 I know y’all put gas & oil in those generators so you can’t return them
9018 2018-09-17 03:34:27 I need that oil change
9019 2018-09-17 03:34:23 When I was in the service in the 80s and Mexico hit the biggest oil strike in history,I thought, beautiful, now the Mexican people can live like us. Shit of course not, the corrupt elitist paved the streets with gold and screwed the people. Why do you think we left England

9023 2018-09-17 03:34:11 'promoting criminality' and 'respect for law and democracy' 
so that would exclude the entirety of big oil, + both Alberta and Cdn gov'ts (says FCA)

'campaign is foreign funded'
so that would exclude the foreign funding for twice-daily lobby visits by big oil to our gov'ts...

9029 2018-09-17 03:33:37 These really irritate me. Yeah the avocado will have more calories, calories aren’t the enemy and what it also lacks to tell you is that the avocado contains essential fats and that Nutella is packed with palm oil

9038 2018-09-17 03:32:36 If Hillary was in office & her cabinet was being indicted & overflowing with guilty pleas their attitude would be a little bit different.

9052 2018-09-17 03:30:48 Spluttering is such a delicious oneomatopoeia, isn't it? :) It's what I prefer and use. 

"Blooming" makes sense: any "curry" starting with hot oil and spices releases an aroma/flavor bouquet. It also sounds good rolling off the tongue of a trained chef or read from a cookbook.

Me: *opens Pinterest* “essential oil remedy”
9238 2018-09-17 03:08:34 This is the plan until they build out their batteries, renewables & alternatives to one day lessen their oil dependency altogether. They are now the largest global producer of batteries & onward. Getting our oil on the cheap is their plan to make the rest work. We’re screwed.
9239 2018-09-17 03:08:30 Keep pedaling your snake oil

9271 2018-09-17 03:04:27 I think I've honestly lost hope in a better future because I feel like it's more likely that oil corporations would find a way to bring hydrocarbons from Titan to earth when we run out of fossil fuels rather then invest in renewable sources of energy because they would make bank.
9272 2018-09-17 03:04:25 @albertateachers - time to strip oil and gas revenues out of pensions and salaries and send back.
9273 2018-09-17 03:04:24 Do you mean accidents related to the oil industry such as spills, well fires/explosions etc? If so, yes, there is. But i am not that the data is segregated by deregulation. You'll have to code for that.

Some of my comments on #USOil are bullish but during the same period, others are bearish. Some fellows got confused then complained about the inconsistency. Overlooking the timeframes is the main reason why such a misunderstanding could've happened.

9442 2018-09-17 02:48:31 Yes, I agree. Definitely research your supplements. Look for cold pressed, liquid juice (real food), check where your fish oil comes from (eg farmed fish or wild), what the outer gel capsules are made from (eg bovine or fish).  Just some "food for thought" :)

9454 2018-09-17 02:46:55 Jim is correct Craig. It is rather like consuming a lot of apple juice (soybean oil or other processed soybeans) versus eating an apple (edamame).

Unless you're strict keto, then both are heresy.
9455 2018-09-17 02:46:47 You don’t know the half of it. Also went grocery shopping. But I saved a few bucks, which will happily go straight to my savings. Think I might invest it in oil, CDs, tech, maybe a blue chip. It’s just good to have options.

9567 2018-09-17 02:30:58 Not true.  Venezuela is crony capitalism disgusted as socialism.  There problem is 80% of there GDP is dependent on oil prices.  I'm neither pure socialism or capitalism... bc there is no such thing as pure.  Even capitalism has socialism built onto it.
9568 2018-09-17 02:30:57 Yup, that was intense. EV should be made affordable (33% markup only but high quality) @elonmusk @tim_cook @JeffBezos @Tesla , accelerate early adoption of EV- d weather's messed up coz of CO2 & plastics (by product of oil). All/most companies are indirectly responsible for death

9605 2018-09-17 02:26:00 coconut oil mixed with a few drops of tea tree oil and equal parts of shea/cocoa butter, depending on what i have and you just have to massage it in for 5-10 mins daily (10 if they're older) so it penetrates the rough scar tissue

9608 2018-09-17 02:25:49 As for it being a panacea for all things medical, unfortunately that’s just not true. I have something similar to Parkinson’s and a symptom of seizures of which cannabis Oil marijuana Parkinson’s meds Botox pretty much everything will lower my seizure threshold. So I can’t use it
9609 2018-09-17 02:25:48 I infuse coconut oil and make edibles.
Great for pain and sleep.
9610 2018-09-17 02:25:37 Yeah take out one more drop of oil and the place is going to implode---poor saudi women just got to drive too. Sure was nice of them just in time for the fiasco. I mean come on. How much art are we going to have to make to stop this madness? I can't tweet fast enough--send paint.
9611 2018-09-17 02:25:36 Exactly.  If people don't want to smoke, it's available in oil and pill form.  I have neuropathy, too, and I do not want to take opioids that are extremely addictive and ultimately cause physical and psychological dependence.
9612 2018-09-17 02:25:13 It was a good idea until the locals turned it into lamp oil

9614 2018-09-17 02:25:11 Criminals prefer USD over BTC anytime because cash is untrackable while BTC is. BTC is way more transparent than USD and therefore every international crime that happens, gets funded in USD. ISIS sold stolen oil against USD, not BTC.

They're just more efficient... and they don't use oil.
9636 2018-09-17 02:21:40 The problem with your whole statement is the same problem with the concept of Muskrat Falls. We are pinning all our hopes on oil revenues. That didn't work out to well for us last time.

And it's higher than soy oil, so there's already a considerable "saturated fat tax" if one were EVER needed.
I like the way you think here.

9673 2018-09-17 02:17:52 I do too! It is so much healthier since there is no sugar, oil or preservatives
9674 2018-09-17 02:17:43 What about the castor oil packs?
9675 2018-09-17 02:16:49 Cute photo opp. Did you explain to them how you will continue to not tax oil companies like we used to so we can’t afford to take care of the elderly or poor or veterans or teachers, etc.? Did that come up over lunch?
9676 2018-09-17 02:16:40 That's actually the only part of that pic I dont like. Actually we buy oil months out so that we have large reserves j.i.c. and those things while aren't directly the presidents control, still kinda are if your able to blame another president for them. So really I just trumpism
9677 2018-09-17 02:16:31 We raised way more money than the republicans while we lost a thousand seats to them. Money obviously, does not mean more votes. That’s what you corporate supporting Dems don’t get. Gas in the car? Hah! Is that a reference to the oil money they take?

9694 2018-09-17 02:13:17 During Dr. Manmohan's tenure the Rupee did not weaken when the whole world went into recession. Fuel price was well controlled inspite of high crude oil prices.
Now Rupee has a free fall. ' External Forces are trying to weaken the Rupee' says Jumla king and economic expert Bozo.
9695 2018-09-17 02:13:10 Yay! My sweetie made an oil shelf for the RV because....well, we have “a few”. 
I organized by color, alpha and size. David said he would rather just do all alpha. . No. I just can’t. 
How would you do this display?
9696 2018-09-17 02:13:05 Let me see? Pay more for gas or get blown up by Iran supported terrorists with nuclear capacity. I’ll ride a bike or better yet...support US oil exploration. 
9697 2018-09-17 02:13:04 Was the derailed train tasked with repairs? I thought it was hauling oil cars ?
9698 2018-09-17 02:13:00 Really excellent points.  I understand that they're saying that the prices are outrageous and they are!

Most of us #medicalcannabis patients are very ill and we can hardly fight this tax battle!

@CFAMMcan said a bottle of oil will cost $32 more!
9699 2018-09-17 02:12:57 I wish someone would just pour concrete mix down every oil source on the planet. Solve a lot of problems immediately
9700 2018-09-17 02:12:53 Extra Virgin olive oil!
9701 2018-09-17 02:12:44 I’m so excited to write in my new journals, read my new book, and use my jojoba oil. 
9702 2018-09-17 02:12:32 Happy birthday to @narendramodi  our beloved PM ...Plz solve Ram Mandir, oil prices and 370 matter quickly for strength of more seats..
9703 2018-09-17 02:11:58 What is that? It looks like the pepper and oil mixture that goes in pho.
9704 2018-09-17 02:11:49 He is a nightmare for Native People too! He will allow oil & gas companies to go wilding on tribal land & national parks.
9705 2018-09-17 02:11:43 Less than a decade more than 50 billion dlls. Were directed from China to the Venezuelan goverment to ensure access to oil. The money guaranteed the Venezuelan goverment conditions to bail a walfare policy driving by oil capital & infrastructure projects.

9709 2018-09-17 02:11:31 speed is your friend.

Personally, I would pan fry the tortillas (with the meat rolled up) in oil first. You will loss the crispyness when you cover them in sauce, but they will hold together better.

9720 2018-09-17 02:10:04 Nope, but consider it a compliment.  They could use peanut oil. That would be an insult.
9721 2018-09-17 02:09:55 Sexism, patriarchy & objectification of women is far from over. Women Bollywood stars when slim & fit are made to appear in the ads of apparel, soaps, beauty products but when they get married, gain weight, they’d appear in cooking oil, kitchen appliances, washing machine ads
9722 2018-09-17 02:09:51 Also, if you think about it then we were supposed to hate communism and buy everything now we’re supposed to buy oil
9723 2018-09-17 02:09:48 no he stole my olive oil
9724 2018-09-17 02:09:47 Congrats!!!!
9725 2018-09-17 02:09:19 I have not figured out why people complain about a pipeline - do they think moving oil by train is better for the environment? Or would they prefer to go without? And FYI, I am a very much an environmentalist, and all for using solar, wind and hydro power whenever possible.
9726 2018-09-17 02:09:05 Environmental damage is made more worse when virgin forests make way for the oil palm plantations! Vehicles will continue to increase but the forest are gone forever together with other plant and animal species that thrive in forests. The greed of man will destroy planet earth.

9730 2018-09-17 02:08:39 One reason is it’s still looked as a taboo, a gateway to harder stuff.  So I’m a Foster Provider for adults with Disabilities, I had a client who would benefit from CBD oil but the State put more restrictions on the admin of it to where it was impossible.  They regulate harder
9731 2018-09-17 02:08:38 What is your favorite essential oil??
9732 2018-09-17 02:08:17 @lisamurkowski Your place in history is waiting. You can either be someone who stood for the right thing, or you can be someone who was bought off by oil drilling in Alaska. It's your choice what your grandchildren and they're children read about you in the history books.

9767 2018-09-17 02:04:47 The UPA used to keep oil prices stable but was depreciating ₹ faster due to their voodoo economics by Harvard Educated Economist.  

If all other prices are stable due to supply chain efficiency as Ashu says, price rise of oil will not impact on all commodities.

9769 2018-09-17 02:04:38 The tax cumulatively totals $400-700 million next year! That money comes directly from patients.

9770 2018-09-17 02:04:35 They want to sell us the disease and the remedy - one harsh overpriced chemical with toxic side-effects per symptom.

They want to make the maximum oil profits destroying the planet, and then turn around & self-deal to profit off the trillions worth of contracts...pure greed.
9771 2018-09-17 02:04:23 Birthday greetings to PM @narendramodi. Wish you a long and healthy life. You are leading  India with a clear vision. And make India #SwachhBharat in more ways than one. Cleaning banking, clearing oil bonds backlog debt, cleaning corruption and many more. All the best.

The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords.
9778 2018-09-17 02:03:30 So sorry to hear, my prayers and thoughts are with you!! Meanwhile you should look into an “alkaline diet” and get some minerals along with CBD oil. Cut out processed foods, meats, sugars  and dairy. Soursop is a natural cancer fighter that stops cancer cell growth.
9779 2018-09-17 02:03:28 I have! Anyway I preferred it's country cousin - a removable kerosene oil lamp, as these 'dynamo' lights were easy targets for petty thieves in Chennai!

9783 2018-09-17 02:02:53 BEIJING (Reuters) - Global oil prices eased in early Asian trading on Monday on concerns that the United States is poised to impose additional tariffs on China, outweighing supply fears from upcoming sanctions on Iran.

9799 2018-09-17 02:00:23 a second thought on your question: alberta is starting to embrace other industries insted of their preference of oil patch.

amazon just hired 1000 emplyees for their distribution plant near calgary -- a 24/7 operation ( as i understand it)
9800 2018-09-17 02:00:13 Also never forget, the whole shebang was a catalyzing domestic black flag operation used as a pretext to go steal oil from the Middle East. "Vote for me, I got you cheap gas!" Costs you trillions in taxes to subdue the people you're stealing from, but Cheap Gas!!!
9801 2018-09-17 01:59:47 Today was eventful and exciting. Cracker Barrel for breakfast with my boys. spent quite some time changing my oil and filter  but we got the job done. Played all day had dinner and grabbed a new pair of kicks for kyzier. Only to end the day with ice cream.
9802 2018-09-17 01:59:46 It means we are paying the transportation cost from India to Australia as extra. Is oil shipping that cheap that it cost same to ship to India and Australia?
9803 2018-09-17 01:59:45 My oil cheaper per litre  than GE free Rape seed oil.We have very low inputs and milling costs cheaper for a grower co-operative.Customers insist on Residue tests partularly since IARC has found glyphosate is a probable human carcinogen.
9804 2018-09-17 01:59:38 GAS could be way cheaper as we pump the most oil in the world!!! Look it up its a #Fact We also export the most!!! I dont understand why gas isn't 1.75 or 1.80 no more then 2 bucks!!! But no big oil biz wants there pockets lined with #Cash
9805 2018-09-17 01:59:18 That’s good. Soybean oil was exactly what I was thinking of that makes soy allergies suuuuuper difficult for people to deal with

9831 2018-09-17 01:54:35 Collagen and CBD oil
9832 2018-09-17 01:54:02 I'd also recommend using a toner and serum, if you can't afford both at the same time (skin care is wildly expensive QQ) then I'd say go for the toner. It'll draw more oil out of your face and dirt out of your pores. I hope some of these suggestions help cysts are the WORST!!!

9868 2018-09-17 01:48:59 If its a ticking noise, check your oil, if its a screeching noise, its either your serpentine belt ( breaking belt, or leaking coolant onto the belt) or your belt tensioner. If it's a rattle/squeek type noise. It may be your hub bearings.

9874 2018-09-17 01:48:32 If you have a chance to try roasted pecan butter on sliced apples it's incredible! Like apple pie with no added sweeteners.

9942 2018-09-17 01:38:55 ETF’s like stablecoins are neo-Keynesian economic models at best. Crypto-currency is more or so Austrian economics. Its like mixing oil and water. Crypto is like water.

9950 2018-09-17 01:38:16 Check crude oil price. It was 115$ during 2013. Now it's 78$. 
Hope you are aware that petrol is extracted from crude oil and not cow's urine. This govt was elected hoping that it will reduce prices. Instead it has increased the same even when crude oil prices are low.
9951 2018-09-17 01:37:54 "Climate Change and Indigenous Reconciliation?" How about having credible scientists speak. How about having credible professionals of the industry speak.

9954 2018-09-17 01:37:26 The United States is the largest producer of oil thanks to fracking. What exactly is your point? We are the worlds second largest economy do you think we need oil to afford it? If you want to nationalize our mineral rights I’m ok with that.

9965 2018-09-17 01:35:21 This has got to be the worst decision in the history of this Country. Why let ANY President make announcements about things they are not educated enough to handle? Bush knew nothing about hurricanes. Obama knew nothing about oil spills. Trump knows nothing! C'mon!
9966 2018-09-17 01:35:19 Prime Minister Shinzo Abe seeking a bilateral meeting with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in New York later this month. Apparently, Abe will convey the notion that Japan's going along with Trump oil sanctions isn't meant to reflect any anti-Iran hostility on Japan's part. (MP)
9967 2018-09-17 01:35:00 I'm convinced he has forgotten the 1970s and is talking about the 80s.

Two Rambo sequels and an oil glut, all against the backdrop of a cowboy actor president... it takes so little effort to be nostalgic for that.

And I'm not saying Tucker is a little-effort guy, *but*...
9968 2018-09-17 01:34:41 As most of the strands have stuck together, you need to add oil to the water and stir often. Try again, pasta is cheap.
