50 2018-11-04 23:20:37 Feeling much better after having run the data today.  A lot of 'pauses' in strong stocks.  They'll be plenty of good stocks to buy when things firm up.

74 2018-11-04 22:46:36 By standard measures, last month was the worst on Wall Street since the 2008 financial crisis. The Nasdaq lost 9.2%, the Dow Jones Industrials, 6.9%, and the S&P 500, 5.1%. Riskier markets such as tech stocks and emerging markets were hit especially hard.
75 2018-11-04 22:45:03 Great view Colombo! As smart money flew away which is only 10% of the mkt, in the latter days of a bull market or bubble, retail investors are typically the most aggressively positioned in stocks. Sadly, these small investors tend to be wrong at the most important market points.

81 2018-11-04 22:34:03 And she was absolutely right. What Republicans, first and foremost care about is money....more money for the already wealthy, more money to buy back corporate stocks and then having no money left to care for the lesser among us. #GOPVotingBlue

83 2018-11-04 22:30:22 I agree with David regarding the market plunge keeping in mind the trade war impacts but I’m not going to sell even one stock in my portfolio. Overall my stocks are up by an average of about 300%, I can take an 80% plunge.
84 2018-11-04 22:28:42 Should definitely be in potato chips and ice cream stocks

86 2018-11-04 22:27:07 @codyko i just wana say that i forever regret not investing in juul stocks the MOMENT i saw one in ur hand f u, have a nice day
87 2018-11-04 22:25:23 That's an example of how a stock is a security.

Tokens are not stocks.

The expectation of profit must arise from their (buyer/seller) common enterprise, which actually are very distinct in token projects. Of course, SCOTUS gets the final say, case by case.
88 2018-11-04 22:25:05 The pound dropping usually has a positive impact on investments as most of the big UK stocks make money around the world. Brexit has been pretty good for investments

I'd add it also means fundamentals matter again.

128 2018-11-04 21:58:26 But it was OK for America to smuggle out Natzis to help build there space rockets.

I believe Walt Disney took an interest in the Natzi scientist Wernher von Braun.

Does that mean all celebrities should Boycott Disney?

Celebrities have become irrelevant laughing stocks.
129 2018-11-04 21:55:46 @BarackObama  U had NO EFFECT ON President Trump’s ECONOMY—HE HAD TO WRITE EXEC ORDERS TO UNDO ALL THOSE CRIPPLING REGULATIONS U PUT IN PLACE THAT STIFFLED COMPANIES & SENT THEM OVERSEAS—HE worked with congress to get TAX CUTS & JOBS ACT—OPTIMISM WAS RESTORED & STOCKS SOARED #KAG
130 2018-11-04 21:55:18 I think so. That's a slightly deeper than average league. He's ranked 85 right now, with 2 combined stocks in under 15 minutes. Go for it.
131 2018-11-04 21:54:23 Trade LESS frequently in volatile markets.

But .   .

Stalk the high quality money setup and pounce when it presents itself.

The volatility will make these wins will be bigger than your normal wins.

132 2018-11-04 21:54:15 It sure does! I purchased this book on Tim's recommendation last weekend and already I am reading it a second time.  The smartest people in the room are the ones  that  put forth the effort to learn.
133 2018-11-04 21:54:02 C'est pas du tout bidon nope le mieux c'est de commencer par faire force avant de faire masse, j'ai des exemples de potes qui l'ont fait et qui sont 50× plus stocks que toi tqt pas mon bro, juste chacun sa technique si cque tu fais marche aussi tant mieux jdis rien

135 2018-11-04 21:53:23 Land and stocks can, and often are, simply inherited. Rich parents make for rich children. Re: “knowledge about stocks”.... The richest people pay financial advisers from their gross capital income to make such decisions for them. No work necessary.
136 2018-11-04 21:52:41 or you could be a savage and go all in on penny stocks
137 2018-11-04 21:52:28 Our stocks are down again, or have you ignored that fact?
138 2018-11-04 21:49:53 They had to work in order to afford to buy the land you are currently renting,  the ammount of knowledge collected over years to know which stocks will go up, etc...
139 2018-11-04 21:46:27 la vie en rose was supposed to be clc's title track??? or smth like that but  cube really did that,,, they could've saved their stocks and one of their groups,,, this song couldve been clc's breakthrough song,,, i mean iz*one did well with the song but imagine clc 
140 2018-11-04 21:43:40 Not sure how they decide what would constitute trading “often”. In my TFSA, I might buy 6-8 stocks, hold for months, then sell if I sense a dip. So that’s 12-16 trades in a matter of a few months. Is that a lot, or is that infrequent? I don’t consider myself an active trader.
141 2018-11-04 21:42:59 Biggest consideration would be risk tolerance, given that higher risk can mean higher potential profit. Highest risk - penny stocks, lowest risk - GIC’s & Bonds, happy medium - real estate and/or diversified equities
142 2018-11-04 21:41:55 Like a merchant? Is that what you mean? Or like a stocks and futures guy?
143 2018-11-04 21:41:03 there have been a few of the new shirts and lots of the badges which makes us all very proud
144 2018-11-04 21:39:42 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
145 2018-11-04 21:38:47 If every man was encouraged to buy individual stocks (regardless of investing knowledge) the way he is encouraged to vote, you'd get even more inefficient markets.

A group of doctors might reach a better diagnosis - but not a group of random people.
146 2018-11-04 21:35:17 Stocks have already gone down quite a bit in the last few months because of Idiot trump.
147 2018-11-04 21:33:44 Absolutely true. We’ve lost 15k since beginning of year, and we are not in high risk stocks.
148 2018-11-04 21:33:37 I just want my stocks  why this computer keep playing
149 2018-11-04 21:32:41 My stocks went down so I’m in red rn. Only time I’m tryna be in red is when I’m eating pussy.
150 2018-11-04 21:32:17 A Holding Company is one that largely holds majority shares of other companies but does little or no business in its own right. A hedge fund speculates on behalf of its investors in a wider area than the usual stocks and shares. I'm simplifying a bit due to Tweet limits.
151 2018-11-04 21:31:59 Many of the new shirts in the audience?
152 2018-11-04 21:31:55 abigail!!! ah, you're wicked yet aren't y'? you'll be clapped in the stocks before you're 20!!!
153 2018-11-04 21:31:31 No. My stocks took a hit. My time and a half holiday pay is gone. My health insurance premiums are up. I also got a pay cut. So much winning NOT. All of the above are directly tied to the current administration.
154 2018-11-04 21:31:25 Shownu talking about stocks turns me on, seriously.
155 2018-11-04 21:30:58 Wish I could see it again but off home to Birmingham now. Only down for the play which was well worth the journey. Enjoy it again. 
156 2018-11-04 21:30:58 nice, enjoy!

161 2018-11-04 21:29:32 Saw it first time round and loved it. Going again on Tuesday  and taking 4 others with no ties to the O's or knowledge of the story apart from what I've told them. Can't wait for their reactions.
162 2018-11-04 21:28:28 Also, we have had 3 failed rally days without a single follow through day.   But maybe the current rally day will produce a FTD.    Still need some canslim stocks setup in full and proper bases and that is what is still missing
163 2018-11-04 21:25:51 I'm finding plenty of stocks this weekend I like, but trying to keep the holdings really small and nimble...may not add any...holding $NIHD, $CIEN, $AMRN few other Momos...general market feels edgeless here...still potential for monster moves either way...
164 2018-11-04 21:25:33 I am a CNA in Florida and I haven't seen a dime increase. No vacation, no sick leave, no benefits. The only ones with a big winning economy are the richest with the stock market. They are investing their savings with the tax cut in stocks not employees
165 2018-11-04 21:24:12 Will the market Recover or Make New Lows this week? #stocks
166 2018-11-04 21:24:05 I love mine
167 2018-11-04 21:22:35 Bump stocks increase the fire rate of an AR-15 at the loss of accuracy. A fully automatic (not legal to purchase in USA for 30+ years) will emtpy its clip in 1/3rd of the time. The difference is huge.
168 2018-11-04 21:21:44 Oct Trading Recap...nice hedge at the top $SOXS $SRTY short $BABA ...thought I was a genius until the 11th...had closed hedges too early and hung on to some stocks $FNJN $CRMD too long...tried the long side right at the bottom (26th), but got shaken out...small loss for month
169 2018-11-04 21:21:13 Palace: "Eh les gars on va faire des stocks de tee-shirts hyper réduits histoire que les gens galèrent à acheter celui qu’ils veulent"
170 2018-11-04 21:21:05 I thought that #U stocks wouldn’t be as correlated as they were when the broader markets sold off. That has me wondering how they’ll react when recession hits; blow-off top when broader markets $ comes in or collapse with the rest of them. 
171 2018-11-04 21:18:01 Wow, such moving performances in @GreaterGameplay. Freely admit I had a tear escape at the end. Cast & crew should be so proud. @James_Phelps @StevenBush90 @MichaelGreco2 @Tom_Stocks @JackH1985 @ScottJKyle1 @Helena_Doughty @ActorPaulMarlon @_V_Gibson_

172 2018-11-04 21:17:13 Stocks are losers,. The economy , jobs, same as it was under Obama,. And Trump owes 413 million in backed Taxes,  what about the hc policies for ppl with pre existing conditions. , Republicans are totally lying there,. Lying Ted and others. Bald faced lying.

174 2018-11-04 21:14:23 I’m talking about buying houses, good credit, stocks and bonds.... I’m trying to build a future for my family
175 2018-11-04 21:14:19 trump is saying STOCKS are going to CRASH if democrats win....what's the nutcake have planned?
176 2018-11-04 21:13:15 " There two types of men in this world; there are men with gunz & men with butta. Now what are the guns? The gunz, that's the real estate, the stocks & bonds, artwork, you know sh*t that appreciate with value. What's the butta? Cars, clothes, jewelry & all that other bullsh*t
177 2018-11-04 21:11:31 This is all crap! The @POTUS needs to BAN the FULL AUTO BAN(BRADY BILL)! Forget bump stocks! Look at what Obama and his deep State has been doing and tell me we don't need our Guns... AND TERM LIMITS!
178 2018-11-04 21:09:48 I assume this applies to all stocks not just "low liquidity" stocks.  Because I've been getting slippage on highly liquid stocks.  But getting slippage because the lvl2 doesn't show hidden buyers/sellers fills are getting priced at the next price level shown.
179 2018-11-04 21:09:39 honour to work under your guideance
180 2018-11-04 21:09:34 Marijauna stocks are up
181 2018-11-04 21:08:34 Most people watch the SP and the Nas. The Dow is only 30 stocks
182 2018-11-04 21:06:53 Still got good stocks and happy to deliver!
183 2018-11-04 21:06:20 If you really think of it objectively, more stocks have been lost to random missed dashback in melee than stocks were lost to RNG tripping in brawl and that bothers me
184 2018-11-04 21:04:01 Agree w Mike. Technically not in love with $XPO now. I prefer stocks wIth good fundies & RS lines at new highs (showing resilience) while the overall market is in correction mode $HQY and $ULTA for example. I’m long $ULTA 268.67 avg. 2 to watch out for if uptrend begins
185 2018-11-04 21:02:16 Don’t follow 30 stocks on a watchlist. Follow only the few % gainers that are doing something big
186 2018-11-04 21:01:57 When you type F and it doesn't autocomplete to Facebook and you end up look at Ford Stocks #GoogleSearchTypos

189 2018-11-04 21:00:14 Doh!

Did I just stumble into a room of unemployed economic experts?

I heard there's quite a few out there since making that "bad call". You know, the one to pull your clients stocks because of the crash that was supposed to occur when President Trump took office. 

Go figure...
190 2018-11-04 20:57:34 J'ai eu une idée pendant ma douche, je vais refaire un thread qui m'avait bien fait marrer. Fav et je te donne une de mes vidéos "j'aime" (dans la limite des stocks disponibles)
191 2018-11-04 20:54:30 @NakedNoodleUK who stocks your soup range??
192 2018-11-04 20:54:26 All off unless a better stage list is available with all on. People can’t remember to toggle stocks/timers from doubles to singles; they won’t be able to do hazards on or off.
193 2018-11-04 20:52:53 I hope my stocks check be here before Christmas...
194 2018-11-04 20:51:46 Of course Julio scores his first touchdown of the season against @Redskins Laughing stocks
195 2018-11-04 20:51:46 Price of gas is up, price of groceries is up, cost of living in general is up, interest rates are up, stocks are struggling, the deficit is up...

And the GOP wants to take away healthcare from those with pre-existing conditions, and social security from the old.
196 2018-11-04 20:51:23 Because an hour after the announcement stocks went negative because it was not proven of even such talk with China
197 2018-11-04 20:49:42 But maybe you can do a video abt the media bias and how their false information helps manipulate Tesla stocks.
198 2018-11-04 20:49:25 Shame on ASU. Free country! Oh that’s right we aren’t free if we disagree with the blue cult!
199 2018-11-04 20:48:37 Maybe coz it's a small store, that doesn't have any space where the staff can put all of their stocks? As someone who wants to become an architect i can tell you, in those situations this is actually normal :)
200 2018-11-04 20:47:30 stocks dry puder for the Ill people and pinkun’s pellets for all the Pale; gave his mundyfoot to Miserius, her pinch to Anna Livia,
that superfine pigtail to Cerisia Cerosia and quid rides to Titius, Caius and Sempronius; made the man who had no notion of shopkeepers
201 2018-11-04 20:46:42 You’d lose them
202 2018-11-04 20:45:37 He's a wealth manager from LA of some sort who goes on CNBC to shill for garbage growth stocks. But mainly he's a walking caricature of a prototypical limousine liberal. Amazing to behold

204 2018-11-04 20:43:55 Just discovered that my local grocery store (rightfully) stocks @NutellaUSA on the highest shelves which makes it nigh impossible for me, a child-sized adult with a sweet tooth, to get her some chocolate hazelnut spread 
205 2018-11-04 20:39:15 Yeah I trade small cap stocks so  being $1 in small caps is horrendous but lucky it was only 100 shares a good lesson learnt for a small price in the grand scheme of things
206 2018-11-04 20:37:23 Yes, having an actual emergency changes your perspective

In addition to my husbands near death when I was 32, he also lost his job when his factory closed during the Great Recession 

Would have been a bad time to have an emergency fund in stocks.
207 2018-11-04 20:37:22 What did our Govenor say about Universal background checks? Or bump stocks?
208 2018-11-04 20:37:01 I'm in favor of outright abolishing the stock market, it has no value. 83% of all stocks are owned by 1% of the population, 50% of Americans have nothing in the stock market. Those that buy and sell stocks get taxed at a significantly lower rate than those who actually work.

211 2018-11-04 20:30:04 The use of 'patriot' seems a bit misplaced? Are they in the stocks for being xenophobic bigots?
212 2018-11-04 20:27:20 Apparently some of the rarer #amiibo stocks are getting replenished.  A bit late, #Nintendo! I already paid a black-market spiv a kidney for a #Marth 3 yrs back.

And to those that say "don't pay scalpers", ever seen a kid, #Christmas morning, opening "the moral high ground"?

217 2018-11-04 20:24:29 Bump stocks are gay
218 2018-11-04 20:24:20 Tax cut only permanent for the rich not the middle class the rich bought back stocks.  People are stil working 2-3 jobs and paycheck to paycheck  and the rich not offering healthcare and driving up gas food utilities insurance and state taxes  so u lie again
219 2018-11-04 20:21:10 $1 a share isnt too bad on higher price stocks though. I'm assuming you are trading pennystocks so ye $1 is a lot. Good that you are aware of your weakness though
220 2018-11-04 20:19:19 Interesting narrative.....go out & ask real people, the ones who don’t have stocks, the ones who have to pay for gas to get to their paycheck-to-paycheck jobs, the ones trying to stretch the dollar to make nutritious meals for their family. ASK THEM ABOUT THE FUCKING ECONOMY!

226 2018-11-04 20:10:04 Honestly, it boils down to you can't do govt work for an industry you have a financial interest in.  You work for HHS, no health medical stocks. It makes sense, and it's not that hard.
227 2018-11-04 20:05:01 So I just started investing last week and I'm planning on being very active for the next 20 years. Is this a good time to start loading up on stocks you guys recommend?

Charge them
Put them in the stocks

Disgraceful
232 2018-11-04 20:02:21 Do you have a thesis or post on what you look for in stocks? How picking sticks & poker relate to each other & more along these lines? Seems compelling.
233 2018-11-04 20:01:55 We have 401k, some aggressive stocks, some gold, some fun stuff (coins, etc). But, SS is important to many ppl who aren't as fortunate as us.

239 2018-11-04 19:56:55 These are just plain good sense. You can’t truly justify any of these things. It doesn’t take a 30 round clip to kill a deer just 30 humans. You don’t need assault weapons to hunt anything but people. Bump stocks are ONLYfor killing people. Need I say more!

241 2018-11-04 19:54:29 This is not true.The avg citizen did not benefit from the TEMPORARY taxcut.Most only saw a difference less than 150 n their paychecks if anything at all. Economy is good 4 corps stocks. Avg person owns neither Jobs paying less hsg/living costs higher.Only low level jobs increased
242 2018-11-04 19:54:25 Stocks are where they were a year ago, that’s not improvement. 
Obama handed Drumpf a great economy, it wasn’t tanked when Donny got here. 
All Don has done is increase Twitter users. Like watching a train wreck, everyone wants to see it happen.
243 2018-11-04 19:53:40 What’s more important while choosing stocks to trade, volume, price, or catalyst?

245 2018-11-04 19:51:26 This tweet was directed at @realtheprophet and is taken out of context. He warned ppl about "pot stocks bubble", I was just pointing out that his most recent picks haven't been performing better.
246 2018-11-04 19:51:17 Con la izquierda se quejan que se dolarizan los stocks y con la derecha que les rompes el culo con la tasa para que vendan el flujo. Y suponen que nadie se da cuenta.

250 2018-11-04 19:47:55 Live your life for The Lord; your stocks will always trend upward! Do for those less fortunate, it be special needs child/adult, a family that’s fallen on hard times(but is still working to overcome that which has dragged them down). Oops! That’s my family situation.

251 2018-11-04 19:47:46 Besides the fact ther investments in pharmaceutical and health stocks!
252 2018-11-04 19:47:01 Modern culture is totally boring. 
Bring back cowpox.
Bring back the village green stocks
Bring back free poppies for all the working classes

254 2018-11-04 19:46:11 Long term, having a layer of safe investments is important. Start with that, not the risky, potentially more profitable

I passed on buying weed stocks in Canada cause it was risky. They went from $8 to $30 to $70. My finance advisor bought them at $8, I looked into them at $30

262 2018-11-04 19:40:34 Agreed! Would like to see the indexes reclaim their 200-day lines. Should a re-test of recent low occurs (with or without undercut), will be paying attention to stocks that will show relative strength vs the indexes, that's how we'll hunt for the leaders.

285 2018-11-04 19:14:13 Turnovers are useless. Dividends paid from profits. I avoid stocks w.o decent, consistent dividends with potential to grow. Packaging contracts are more volume centric despite innovations. Trade war 'may' throw up favourable surprises but lack of visibility. Better options avbl.

295 2018-11-04 19:03:10 Love or hate Trump, I pay less taxes, get more money in my check each month, less regulation of my business, and see my stocks going up than when the turd doubled the ntl debt by himself, raised taxes, increased regs on businesses, almost tripled healthcare costs, etc.
296 2018-11-04 19:02:16 Very similar to how America will use Trump as a prop in stocks for all to see in front of the White House.

297 2018-11-04 19:02:09 Yowling? Well, I guess they do have good reason to be mournful. Social Security, Healthcare, Medicaid on the chopping block when hardly any of the tax cuts for the corps/wealthy trickled down. How many have enough stocks to retire on? Jobs are starting to leave - b/c of tarriffs.

301 2018-11-04 18:59:27 Well bump stocks are not automatic and if you ask me unreliable. Also the barrel heats up to fast on a AR-15 when using a bump stock and will catch fire alot faster than a M-16 so no its not military grade. Also bump stocks are about to be illegal federally. So.Not military grade
302 2018-11-04 18:58:51 i’m putting all my money in whisper rap stocks for 2019
303 2018-11-04 18:57:39 its not because pentagon and gidke success but its because clc comeback was originally around the same time hyuna-edawn scandal, cube stocks dropped they need money so they canceled theirs comeback and sold the song....
304 2018-11-04 18:57:08 Most of them fear coz they tend to earn a living on saved savings besides they invest in less risk business like stocks treasury bill and notes coz they still to stay in comfort zone they left in employmentb

308 2018-11-04 18:53:31 Chu, you worked there bro, talk to them please. I know they know and you already talked to them but they're killing the game, bringing their stocks value down with it.
309 2018-11-04 18:53:24 No...just options. I own stocks in my 401k
310 2018-11-04 18:53:22 We seek n tired of being laughing stocks pls khosi
311 2018-11-04 18:52:50 No. Report yourself to Dr bookeater for polling about having you put in the stocks.
312 2018-11-04 18:52:12 Yeah... I seldom go naked on stocks.. And when I do I keep it to 1 lot.
313 2018-11-04 18:51:57 kinda wanna go learn how to do stocks or go to school to learn it would be nice
314 2018-11-04 18:49:58 Stocks, commodities, currencies, crypto... It's all the same guys. The only difference is some shit is the flavor of the day and some shit is out of favor... Then the Masters rotate out of one and into another  
315 2018-11-04 18:49:52 Social media great for getting some leads but if you're not screening for stocks or filtering charts you will likely under perform. If you do what everyone else does, you will get very similar results.
316 2018-11-04 18:49:50 Very observant of you...now do you have pressing issues to take care of?? I thought not..so check stocks and keep up with whose offshore accounts prosper and buy a dark horse for a hobby farm...see ya around

334 2018-11-04 18:39:44 Aw, Fake News CNN is so compassionate to communists - how cute. When Obama plunged us into debt with China, let China go unchallenged as they manipulated currency & stocks, and stole U.S. intellectual property, CNN fawned. Now, Trump is fixing all that, but CNN hates Trump! Crazy

356 2018-11-04 18:06:51 I liked the smaller $ tick size (not realizing back then that it moved much more directionally) and I used to also trade a lot of tech stocks alongside it so provided more relevant context to those, then I grasped all of the NASDAQ indicators the CME puts out so I stuck with it

359 2018-11-04 18:03:22 There are no fixed rules. If conviction is high in a particular stock, must allocate it higher. It all depends on individual. Low allocation means one is not sure of his stock picking. Max i would prefer 10-12 stocks, sufficient for a pf that makes 10% allocation to each stock.
360 2018-11-04 18:03:05 STOCK MARKET WILL CRASH IF REPUBLICANS WIN because other countries will accelerate cutting back on business with USA.

376 2018-11-04 17:50:23 That's Tru. What I see if that, ads for that Benz will be in your face day in/out which becomes ur dream as you sleep. Stocks and investments are of a secret society it seems, for most.
377 2018-11-04 17:47:59 My take, a chart is only as real as the big money thinks it is, and the more obscure a chart the less the big money pays attention to it. The farther back in time you go, the less relevant it is to current day investing/trading decisions, especially on individual stocks.
378 2018-11-04 17:47:27 It seems to me that whenever the stocks of the few are rising, Nature is really paying the debt for the health & well-being of All of Us. Sic!
379 2018-11-04 17:45:46 Himanshu sir could u pls elaborate on how these stocks like Kajaria u posted come under radar.. Is ther any s/w u use so they come up.. Learn g so any inputs will be helpful
380 2018-11-04 17:44:12 In my eyes, XRP if used as DLT (distributed ledger technology) via payment gateways such as ACI Worldwide might propel its current price of $0.45 up to $3 or more before the end of December 2018. #xrp #ripple #cryptocurrency #altcoins not #pennystocks or #stockstowatch or #stocks
381 2018-11-04 17:43:57 They never will, but they'll take that money made from stocks and bonds and tax cut money.
382 2018-11-04 17:42:15 Watching @BBCCountryfile and the feature on white eggs v brown. I don’t get why people don’t buy white eggs - I see them as far more ‘natural’ than the brown, and I swear the yolks are better. Thank goodness @waitrose stocks them! #egggate
383 2018-11-04 17:41:34 List Parliament in stock exchange, sure becomes best performing stocks all times.
384 2018-11-04 17:40:22 Hey!
Thatch deserves to be in the stocks. Free him at your peril.
385 2018-11-04 17:39:45 AND the unemployment rate has been on a steady trend downward over the last 8 years thanks to PBO.  The stock market is high b/c the 1% are buying back their stocks which means NOTHING to the average working family....
386 2018-11-04 17:39:39 Stocks wouldn't be a bad idea lol
387 2018-11-04 17:38:15 @Twitter is hurting itself. Many Republicans own Twiiter stocks. It's foolish for them to demonstrate time and again how they stifle conservative speech. Americans had enough of the ''free speech for me, but not for you''.
388 2018-11-04 17:37:29 Nagchat sa akin may ari ng Sole Slam 
Sayaang tong opportunity na toh naubusan lang ako stocks :<
389 2018-11-04 17:36:55 Hopefully also Extended Version with Paul Bettany's speech in front of the stocks, cut from the theatrical release!!
390 2018-11-04 17:35:51 Na so NIKE drop that Colin Kaepernick "sacrifice everything ad". People started burning their NIKE merchs. 

Guess whose income & stocks increased that period? 
391 2018-11-04 17:35:38 26 states have passed gun control laws in <6 months. Bump stocks banned in 9 states & counting. ~250K voters registered by gun control groups. Keep telling lies while others do; soon they'll be knocking on your door to take all your guns away, oh fearless anonymous person.
392 2018-11-04 17:35:04 j'ai des stocks de bouchon de liège si ça peut dépanner certains.
393 2018-11-04 17:34:38 No reason for ANY one to suffer with pain. I think Scott should read the PHYSICIAN OATH... DO NO HARM. He missed that part i believe. Those millions he made off RX stocks.... makes one wonder who is paying him for this drug
394 2018-11-04 17:34:34 (stocks and shares) which, surprisingly, affects predominantly already rich people. The difference made to those of the common or poorer economic classes? Almost zero. If you don't have the intellectual wherewithal to identify racism (went more than I thought 4/5)
395 2018-11-04 17:33:41 Well we're at 7 billion+ now and that is way too many. Fish stocks going down, can't create more pasture land for cattle without creating too much methane, can't be all vegetarians because that would mean removing too many trees and besides we would have to transport it.
396 2018-11-04 17:32:42 Yes, exactly. Trust or agreement of methods is also different than belief in their ability to control outcomes.

Similar to the equity bull market where everyone has been talking bearish, but acting bullish for years because there's "no alternative" to U.S. stocks for them.

399 2018-11-04 17:31:11 To people blaming (G)I-IDLE coz cube might be postponing CLC comeback coz of IDLE's success or talking shit on IZ*ONE coz Cube sold La vie en rose 2 Mnet, WELL scandal with hyuna made Cube stocks decreased THEY NEED MONEY thus selling that song 2 Mnet knowing Mnet can pay it well
400 2018-11-04 17:31:03 Would be useful and thankful if stocks meeting this criteria can be shared
401 2018-11-04 17:29:03 The Brazen Minotaurs were wiped out because the Death Guard destroyed their geneseed stocks,
402 2018-11-04 17:28:19 Iam in Ottawa Ontario, fairly new to trading.   Any advice for me with buying penny stocks?
403 2018-11-04 17:27:46 @ChildersRadio On Tuesday's "Stocks UP" segment, please consider Coach "AVE MARIA".   He is a crazy dude, but wow, he has turned Michigan into a powerhouse again.
404 2018-11-04 17:27:24 Biomass plants emit more CO2 than fossil fuel plants & rely on forest growth to compensate for emissions from cropping & burning. So can only reduce CO2 emissions IF forest stocks are increasing, which they are not. Emissions are not low enough to reach Paris or IPCC targets.

406 2018-11-04 17:25:25 repub.cant brag about economy because a 3% raise at minimum wage is 2cts.80cents per week.80%of stocks are owned by 15%of population.people on fixed incomes had no benefit.inflation has diminished their income.assholes!
407 2018-11-04 17:25:20 let's break down again.

1. again I don't think everyone should know about private business on one offs

2. I don't care about bump stocks, they're rarely used

3. 3D printed guns would explode upon first use at best, at worst it wouldn't fire at all.
408 2018-11-04 17:15:32 Need to hit him up to see what stocks are taking off in ‘19

410 2018-11-04 17:15:21 Thanks for the sharing! Great choice of stocks.
411 2018-11-04 17:14:11 Just a note that I have a second account Thomas Kaine on Stocks under @kaine_on for those interested in sharing investment thoughts... didn't want to mix investment info with politics unless relevant
412 2018-11-04 17:12:53 Stocks plunged as Smithfield Foods, Inc. unveiled a respectful domino set today.
413 2018-11-04 17:11:52 CRUCIAL!

415 2018-11-04 17:11:05 Disclamer....... positions in multiple CBD related stocks.   Turns out we have our own CBD internal compounds and they become deficient in older age. This research was truncated by the war on drugs.  Yet another war we lost to big pharma.  .....
416 2018-11-04 17:10:44 Niggas ask me to explain this shit to them and expect me to get a full scope of stocks in under 5 minutes and wonder why they lose money. This shit takes time.
417 2018-11-04 17:10:17 2/2  I took a very bold decision and predicted exact reversal. Thank God it proved correct & we picked bottom in most Housing finance stocks.
Special thanks to all my followers / Friends & Clients for their immense faith on me. God bless them.

419 2018-11-04 17:09:32 The US mid term elections are on Tuesday once the dust settles the previous 18 have ended in Stocks rallying significantly n matter who wins. May be prudent to sit it out until the results are in
420 2018-11-04 17:09:21 Disgusting. Don't the mindless pricks realise without such sacrafice they would be having a totally different life. Was their Ancestors one of them. My god their parents must be so ashamed. Bring back the stocks....
421 2018-11-04 17:08:07 We must ban bump stocks!
422 2018-11-04 17:07:58 I could go on & on but u don’t care about ethics, morals and our country’s past inclusive history. You only care about yr fake christianity, your guns, your stocks & yourselves! It’s all about greed & guns -who cares about our children’s future? Just protect yourself & YR stuff!
423 2018-11-04 17:07:06 Will you play him on FD?
Will you play with 2 stocks, not 3?

I would not play him on FD
I would not play with 2 stocks or 3

They say the grinch's heart shrank 3 sizes that day
For his leak was wrong, and he would not have his way.
424 2018-11-04 17:06:20 My stocks on Jupiter are up 8000%
425 2018-11-04 17:06:12 Instead of buying Jordan's for $200 I'll buy tesla stocks or buy hella ford stocks and just collect dividends.
426 2018-11-04 17:05:17 I also hold few quantities of these stocks. What should be the weitage (in %) of each stock in a long term PF ? Thanks.
427 2018-11-04 17:05:13 @labound123 I'm thinking 
IF Dems win both House and Senate THEN Gold goes up and stocks go down. $1,233 as of today.

IF Dems win only House Not Senate THEN Stocks don't move much

IF Rep win both House and Senate THEN stocks soar

(All of the above short term)

429 2018-11-04 17:03:23 Ça s'appelle créer son marché, bande d'assistés. Ah ca c'est sûr, vous ne pouvez pas comprendre, hein, les gauchiasses ! Merci de penser un peu à mes stocks, bande d'egoistes !
430 2018-11-04 17:02:19 What Modiji has increased is not advised by you? government buys what stocks they maintain as back up reserves & do not buy 100%. However, Congress planted commission agents in grain markets since 1947 blackmailing them to buy much lower than MSPs.
431 2018-11-04 17:00:46 We had 3 stocks in Europe from the start and look how that ended up
432 2018-11-04 17:00:46 $VKTX $MDGL $GLMD Stoked to play options/daytrades for the upcoming data on these three stocks. Violent moves both ways. Does bad data for MDGL mean power to VKTX? Will the 24w data VKTX data be good? does GLDM gain ground with the 59PT?
433 2018-11-04 17:00:30 Que lo diga cualquier militante ignorarte todavía... Pero vos que sos economista, no sabes lo que les dejo Kici...? No te hubiera gustado el ajuste, no te gustó el gradualismo... que te hubiera gustado? Seguir emitiendo y liquidando stocks y reservas??

438 2018-11-04 16:59:22 Businesses are nothing more than value creation and delivery systems.  The only difference between them is scale, scope and quality.  Equity is just owning a slice of a particular system.  Investing any other way is just speculation. #investing #stocks #alpha
439 2018-11-04 16:59:14 Don’t forget the GOP robbed your financial future so big corp can buy back their stocks and give their executives large pay raises. The 1% privately holds 40% of US wealth, 90% holds 78%  of all national debt

Don’t believe the hype. It’s a ticking time bomb to a recession
440 2018-11-04 16:58:34 Niggas really mad they’re only making a dollar investing in stocks when they only invested 100 bucks. Like nigga you get what you give. Like i didn’t put mad cash into this shit. Compound interest is your best friend. 7% annual interest on 100 is exactly what you think it is.
441 2018-11-04 16:58:29 Only chocolate available right now. Stocks are on the way now.
442 2018-11-04 16:58:28 Went last night and very much enjoyed the re working. Very moving performances, made even more enjoyable after the win at Fylde, but someone needs to advise as in the intro, they refer to us playing the likes of 'Rochdale & Gillingham' in the National League...?

445 2018-11-04 16:48:04 Its possible! we just did a completely different correction (subwaves and all) than the nasdaq and microsoft and qualcomm and all the internet stocks! I expect the .618 to be respected after the first impulse. we could double bottom again but I think that is less likely
446 2018-11-04 16:46:30 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to improve your EDS
447 2018-11-04 16:46:28 Which stocks should I buy?
448 2018-11-04 16:46:27 Tomorrow should be telling as to what will happen on Tuesday with the #markets. I hope to see a giant surge in futures- signaling the #Republicans will be retaining control. #stocks #NASDAQ

452 2018-11-04 16:43:24 What is he trading exactly? Goods? Services? Stocks?
453 2018-11-04 16:42:43 I disagree , at some point u have to take a bold stand , I am clear PM stocks will do great over next two years while every thing else suffers more or less.The move is not far off now IMO .
454 2018-11-04 16:40:37 En effet. C'est sympa de faire profiter les fans.
En espérant qu'il y ait assez de stocks jusqu'aux dates de décembre.
455 2018-11-04 16:40:16 I’ve been blessed to be able to semi retire due to some properties that I have, stocks and other investments. I worked very hard for what I have for over 30 years. I don’t see a recession happening. Idk I could be wrong here
456 2018-11-04 16:38:36 I'm just using the stock NYSE derived graph that google search has available, set to 5 years. Stocks dropped to around $90 around the time-frame I mentioned encompassing "SOLO".
457 2018-11-04 16:37:54 Stocks are zooming? Seems like u don't invest in stock market.
458 2018-11-04 16:37:41 Haha if I wasn't allergic, I'd already have two! My mom has a black kitten, and it's tempting  Although I'd have to buy stocks in reactin...
459 2018-11-04 16:35:32 what do we want MOVEMENT when do we want it NOW, stocks saying to you Buy the LOWS
460 2018-11-04 16:35:23 I do have a role... but I'm looking at a dashboard of several metrics.  My biases play a tiny role.  And my biases are like that of a stock professional suggesting the stocks that they believe will go up in value.
461 2018-11-04 16:34:53 What he taketh , he giveth back...    If he and others like him dont buy back their stocks , the stocks will go into a free fall.
462 2018-11-04 16:32:28 My stocks did well last week. I just need to maintain and keep pumping money into them
463 2018-11-04 16:30:30 Ohh haah lah, sorry sorry aku lupa. Tersasar di jln mu. Kau ada stocks ke
464 2018-11-04 16:30:24 You play stocks too?
465 2018-11-04 16:28:49 The biggest problem for the stock market is Trump... other countries  don't want to do business with the USA companies.. so company executives  are dumping stocks at record rates
466 2018-11-04 16:28:12 Back in my hometown where the record store that stocks a surprising amount of indie/emo/punk is closed on Sundays. It’s for the best, but also uggghh
467 2018-11-04 16:28:11 They (medias) are always biting their nose to spite their face. Issues: illegal imigration, N korea resolved for now, tax cuts, raises for working class, isis stopped cold for now, stocks sky high... Vote party (Republican) not independent. V I P to America
468 2018-11-04 16:27:31 You need to follow @todd_harrison for great perspective on US stocks, imo.. lots to read there

470 2018-11-04 16:26:45 Tech companies are in a bubble, bursting now.  Silicon valley will be decimated with layoffs within couple of years.  Their exaggerated political influence will decline as their stocks and employment numbers fall.. Necessary for a rebalancing of the American Political system.
471 2018-11-04 16:26:39 Sounds like it’s time to short the ESG ETFs. Hedge the short with coal, tobacco, liquor, and junk food stocks.
472 2018-11-04 16:26:35 STOCKS decline as investors focus on trump & republican trade wars.  GOP economic policies caused GIGANTIC declines in China stock market  (down over 20%) & Europe (down over 10%).  Who is going to lend USA  $$ to fund MASSIVE BUDGET DEFICIT caused by Tax Cuts for Billionaires.
473 2018-11-04 16:26:27 may new stocks na but I don't want to post it yet... Deliver muna ko bukas ng pending items
474 2018-11-04 16:25:52 talk with @StocksToTrade
475 2018-11-04 16:25:05 Of course. I’ve worked in the business for 40 years. Dealt with pretty much every one of them. Not saying that US people don’t own shares. Same as Canadians own US stocks. But they are Canadian companies.
476 2018-11-04 16:24:24 I am relatively new to shares but have learnt thia lesson quickly in 2 yrs. One of my stocks lost 16% in last 2 weeks,  decided to hold, and then recovered 10% this last week! Good fundamentals remain reason for buying = stick to your guns!
477 2018-11-04 16:23:44 Hi Tim I'm still trying to get the link to download stocks to train and am a lot of trouble with it I wanna learn I'm looking at the videos
478 2018-11-04 16:23:15 Yeah.....i already pre ordered but i was hoping that there were available stocks already...

Hahahaha
479 2018-11-04 16:22:45 Let's face it .
....

Fox is a ultra right wing rich persons propaganda machine and actual facts are never spoken ....just manipulated to justify the rich getting more rich.

Stocks go up and down under Trump they mainly will go down
480 2018-11-04 16:22:14 If you love babies and not just fetuses, then you support a ban on assault weapons/bump stocks, and stronger background checks, so that nuts can’t go into our schools and murder those babies?  And you must support Planned Parenthood, which helps young women get contraception?
481 2018-11-04 16:20:44 From an investment perspective, the slump is just good news. Long bull market in the stocks, long bear market in crypto. I think the tables will turn 

Or no crypto bull market ever again? Maybe it's just a tulip mania bubble who knows, rat poison and all that 
482 2018-11-04 16:18:23 Buffett's Shows His Appetite for Buying Stocks, Including His Own - DA CROOKED "KOCH"-SUKKA DON'T HAVE NO CHOICE, OR IT WOULD NOT BE AS HI-PRICED AS IT IS ! THIS TAX MONEY WAS SUPPOSED TO BE USED FOR WAGES AND JOBS FOR THE REAL AMERICAN PEOPLE ! PHUK TREASONOUS LARDAZZ TRUMP !
483 2018-11-04 16:18:00 Trump and the GOP made the deficit by giving the top 1% a huge tax cut.  Then the ultra rich bought back stocks, and squirreled away cashin tax havens overseas.  We all saw them partying on the front lawn of the whitehouse when they took healthcare away from 23 million people.
484 2018-11-04 16:16:34 Be careful tax breaks to corporations are what was holding stocks, high end home sales on Maui have been flat for two years now, trump runs businesses into bankruptcies, it can all come crashing down

487 2018-11-04 16:13:42 apple stocks rise by 10%.
488 2018-11-04 16:13:14 Hahahahaha!!!!!!! Sure it was. Had nothing to do with the company’s financial condition. Tell me, what other stocks do you like?
489 2018-11-04 16:13:13 Your patience with people is really admirable. The time and effort that you spend to explain and repeat without losing cool is great!
I've always loved reading your opinions and have learned to form my own (w.r.t. stocks). Thank you.
490 2018-11-04 16:13:10 Wow, that was a 40% haircut from ath to $176 in 4 weeks, one of the strongest stocks
491 2018-11-04 16:09:58 I do take full responsibility, I haven't been doing enough to denounce the scamming, educate people about why these "investments" are scams, and promoting non-scams like Bitcoin and stocks. Every day I try to do more. In fact, the tweet you were responding to was doing just that.
492 2018-11-04 16:09:36 Oh that's pretty except I am not a fan of folding stocks at all
493 2018-11-04 16:08:41 i do too 
494 2018-11-04 16:07:18 Walt Disney gave his housekeeper stocks every year for the holidays, and she died a multi-millionaire.
495 2018-11-04 16:05:46 Yeah saw it and sounds reasonable but I still think that 3 stocks is the way to go
496 2018-11-04 16:05:07 I have bet huge on Gold & Silver stocks along with some platinum , a few base /EV metals plays. Physical v less .

503 2018-11-04 15:55:24 That is NOT true. Trump hasn't created anything. 
Companies are taking jobs to Mexico because of Trump.
Stocks are down.

Nothing he promised has been done. Not one thing has been done to improve our economy.

504 2018-11-04 15:54:33 I wish I could opt out of social security for a higher return. 

Why is it that other SWFs are invested in equities/alts and meanwhile we’re tracking what looks to be short end bonds? 

Compound interest lags way behind on a 6% inflation adj return (stocks) vs near 0% for bonds.

508 2018-11-04 15:52:31 They must be excluding October from the data, cause 2018 gains have been wiped out.   That $2T handout created  bubbles as companies were using cash to boost results and buy back stocks.   That money is all gone now.   They are getting out, we should too.
509 2018-11-04 15:51:31 I can't buy into this BS, sorry. The game is rigged, its not about value as it is about momentum. 
Example, FANG isn't value, they're all over inflated momentum stocks.
Yet, I finally had to bail on GE, got in at 29, doubled down 15 and sold out at 9, its BS.

553 2018-11-04 15:24:54 of course,rates move first,once they have enough momentum/velocity,credit spreads start to move because default probabilities increase (even ever so slightly),stocks can still rally,but if the overall cost of money (Rates+Spreads) are too high, issuers + consumers feel the pinch.

591 2018-11-04 14:56:52 Stunned that the historically low yields on 30yr (and all) bonds are all but ignored in most discussions of a 60/40 portfolio. It's a quantifiable & objective change in the risk-reward measure of bonds (and their ability to "balance" stocks) that is somehow ignored.
592 2018-11-04 14:53:56 Makes perfect sense about the trend line respecting the highs. Point noted. 

I am trying out small tweaks to the trendlines and then  observing the stocks action. 

At times if provides a good entry and at times it fails. 

Just boils down to risk management more than the entry

622 2018-11-04 14:25:25 Why would Democrats come to the table with ideas when Trump will eventually just walk back/ignore any compromises? Immigration, Bump stocks.
623 2018-11-04 14:21:41 Yes we have stocks :) Please check the provided pre-order form.
624 2018-11-04 14:20:05 Hello, we are not accepting orders anymore as of the moment. We will announce this week if we will have extra stocks... :(
625 2018-11-04 14:19:28 Another question. Why do you focus on just micro stocks? I would like to understand.  Life is full of opportunities in every size. That is the magic. Thanks!
626 2018-11-04 14:19:23 Not only they are small minded, they make the mistake taking the knowledge of stocks and forex and thinking it applies to this new asset class

@GOP cannot even outlaw bump stocks after 59 MURDERS in Las Vegas due to the #NRABloodMoney that they take

631 2018-11-04 14:16:35 But only when stocks go up.
632 2018-11-04 14:15:26 We Americans are on a sugar high paying for our tax cuts with borrowed money from our children's credit cards. On the anniversary of the mass shooting at Las Vegas, still no Fed ban on automatic weapon modifying bump stocks. If the young ever figure this out, Watch out!#Midterms
633 2018-11-04 14:14:55 a simple retroactive adjustment in capital gains tax, based on value of stocks on Feb 20, 2009 would balance the federal budget.  cspanwj
634 2018-11-04 14:14:31 Penny stocks (stocks trading at less than $5 per share) are a risky, but with some research potentially huge returning investment.
635 2018-11-04 14:12:15 That's great news Caroline. Make sure they have plenty of stocks for Christmas 
636 2018-11-04 14:11:03 I feel like i'll never put money into stocks. Mainly cause theres other things i want to do with my money than that.

640 2018-11-04 14:08:36 Important lesson taught in "Rich Dad Poor Dad":

The rich acquire assets (stocks, bonds, real estate, websites, businesses, etc.) while the poor and middle class acquire liabilities that they think are assets (houses, cars, most material possessions, etc.).
641 2018-11-04 14:08:11 Enjoy my free analysis of stocks @thinkervenu
642 2018-11-04 14:04:04 LOL. Dude it is a useful comparison as the formula for market cap doesn’t depend on the asset class. Gold, stocks, crypto, fish and all other stuff is market cap = price * whole amount
643 2018-11-04 14:03:23 Yeah, good thing the rich got those tax cuts so they could invest in stocks and boost the market.
644 2018-11-04 14:02:14 $MFIN traded up nicely last week ahead of this week’s earnings. While the street is expecting $0.18, we are more excited about the preferred getting done before YE and expansion of the industrial bank. We see $MFIN earning over $1.20 per share in 2019 #StockMarket $Stocks

646 2018-11-04 14:00:35 ....Democratic proposals to ban bump stocks and prevent dangerous individuals from receiving a concealed carry permit, saying, “I don’t think anyone in the history of our state has ever been killed by a bump stock” and “neither one of them is very serious.
647 2018-11-04 13:58:34 So in reality it becomes a stocks vs bonds market- not to that extreme but investors price in different expectations

651 2018-11-04 13:56:33 The main reason investors abandoned the group is because the stocks went down and that indiscriminate selling is what makes many of the stocks cheap now. That's how the stock market works

685 2018-11-04 13:04:31 If the stock of company A is worth $1000 and there are 1000 stocks/shares it will have a market capitalisation of $1MLN.

690 2018-11-04 12:53:09 There are 4 Ways to Learn Investing

1)Study of history of last 50 years (Experience of Market Cycles)

2)Study of what Stocks have created wealth (Factors that make money)

3)Study the People who have created Wealth and How (Qualitative factors that make money)
691 2018-11-04 12:51:39 I agree it does sound good especially where They can not own Individuals stocks   and have to buy government managed investment accounts. The way our government manages money they all will be broke in no time!! She will be broke in no time

693 2018-11-04 12:50:46 I call BS.  Let’s see your ytd/1/3/5 year return if you are going to talk traders w the ease of a cherry picker.  You are not making money trading stocks/options, and it’s bc your tweets are all reactionary backward bragging.  Since you said $tsla below 300 YE, we will watch.
694 2018-11-04 12:50:44 Trading is not about only buying 52week highs or stocks near highs, or only buying stocks near lows, or not buying the dip or only buying if we are above a certain avg etc.. It's all risk management and how you handle the trade.

702 2018-11-04 12:37:00 Great ideas aren't born overnight.

In 1993, Jeff Bezos developed D.E. Shaw's third market operation. His strategy was committing to make markets in all listed securities--even thinly traded stocks.

Why? Bezos said:

"We think there is a desire for *one stop shopping*."

What's the economy?
Because most don't buy into stocks, and WAGES are FLAT or LOWER.
What % work more than one job because you never say. 
"BUT TRUMP COULD TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMY!!"

Our purchasing power is LOWER, our HC COSTS are HIGHER.

you can't put yourself on a scale and think you're better than someone, because hat's just going to fill an ego that doesn't deserve to exist.
If you're SDing/giving stocks away, you need to acknowledge that, and accept that you need...
720 2018-11-04 12:19:04 So at the end, when he said “masternodes”; you still thought stocks, huh? Interesting.

729 2018-11-04 12:01:37 That's a great thought, will look forward to your videos on YouTube.

874 2018-11-04 07:45:37 Why not bring back the birch while you’re at it Tories? - Oh and we could have stocks and pillories installed in the village square and then put the while idea to a gerrymandered Referendum which will be advisory just in case we don’t get the result we want.

885 2018-11-04 07:18:12 Many stocks just went through a10 % correction. 401K statements will show a lot of minus signs. Stocks like Amazon, IBM, Apple, Netflix, Facebook, have taken it on the chin. Amazon went from a high of $2,050 a share to around $1,600
Some stocks were taken behind the woodshed&shot
886 2018-11-04 07:16:45 STOCKS TO WATCH:

1. STRAITS
2. SLP
3. DNEX

YTD, FBM Small Cap Index has dropped by 25%. Investors should focus on fundamentals & growth of small & mid-cap players especially after greater policy clarity from Budget 2019 for potential rebound.

896 2018-11-04 07:00:09 No Sherlock, we've known it for decades. Every time the price goes up its INSTANT, meaning that the cheaper fuel in their stocks is sold to us at the new HIGHER price. But thanks for sharing that nugget of information 
897 2018-11-04 06:58:38 You must own a seat on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to trade stocks. The highest price paid for a seat on the NYSE was $2,650,000, in 1999 (when the market was near a high point before the tech stock crash). The lowest price paid for a seat, was $4,000, in 1876.
898 2018-11-04 06:56:22 And the other current  prop is Jordan McLean .A guy that played about 5 games this year.Tells you about the prop stocks at the moment don’t you think . Klemmer gets picked because there isn’t anyone else to pick. Fifita Tonga , Paul Vaughn (injured) & a level below . RCG ?

915 2018-11-04 06:12:04 One concrete example here that leads to large scale financial ruin is not understanding why being long a high-vol asset like crypto in 2017 or penny stocks is so risky even when it’s consistently gone up. Auto-correlated Markov processes really can ruin people!

935 2018-11-04 05:42:23 You have no idea how shell companies on the ASX work, and how penny stocks go from explorer to developers. 

AVZ used to be a shell.

It now has highest and biggest lithium deposit in the world, also they used to be valued at less than $5mill. 

Look at them now.

937 2018-11-04 05:39:40 Must have gone through at least 10 *Diwali Samavat 2075 stock picks* reports.
Most of the stocks don't overlap so it's going to be interesting to see which ones actually will work. 

The ones recommended are top safe large businesses to bet on so I see no value addition. #stocks
938 2018-11-04 05:38:50 As a investment strategy for next few months, I have decided to buy stocks only below 10 and few below 20. 
Reason:  risk can't be quantified in micro cap. Good cos available at throw away price, we can buy truck load and wait for sentiments to change...

1.KESM
2.GTRONIC
3.D&O
4.AEMULUS
5.KEYASIC
6.INARI

They are cheap & trading below their 2 year average except for INARI. The strong growth in global semiconductor sales is poised to hit its highest level this year. But investors will have to tread carefully.
952 2018-11-04 05:19:44 Will be down almost 50 %.all the stocks in next diwali
953 2018-11-04 05:19:10 A consensus trade with all mutual funds seeking Alpha from same stocks never worked. Axis Bank and ICICI Bank are those such stocks now. Those who entered in distress earlier will gain now but new entrants are in for a disappointment yoy.
954 2018-11-04 05:17:54 And it was 1 left wing nut job. Now how many people that own those bump stocks are killing people? so we ban them based off 1 persons actions. So over 10,000 will die this year from drunk drivers. Time to ban cars

990 2018-11-04 04:14:06 very good attack but Australia not even looking competitive at this point. batting stocks at an all time low
991 2018-11-04 04:13:49 I think Adam's correct, Amna, and Syria was not expected to deliver CW by that time, as Syrian stocks had already been declared, tested/typed and removed/destroyed. The "Sarin grenades" were tested by OPCW. From what I understand the contents did not match a known Syrian CW type.
992 2018-11-04 04:13:39 You should never buy stocks with any money that isn't "extra". Spend all of that you want on them. It can be very lucrative. But never spend a dime of the money you really need. And SS is something you don't want to go without. If you're in Florida, you should know that.
993 2018-11-04 04:12:56 depends on the overall speed of the game. Melee goes by too fast for players to adapt with less than 4 stocks, Smash 4/Brawl always had longer match times so their requirements were often fewer stocks and shorter timers
994 2018-11-04 04:12:13 Similar ytd pattern was observed in major pharma stocks in 2014-15, followed by 30-40% drawdowns in 2016-17.. interesting!
995 2018-11-04 04:12:11 Purple....black & blue are novelties....by going back in time...you could easily buy stocks &make more $ than you could ever spend...Greens a tough one..watching your loved ones grow old & die would be haunting...&their children..etc...while you never age...you would be hated!
996 2018-11-04 04:12:05 Lots of people make less than bright financial decisions like that. I know, I do consulting work for non-profits that help people in financial distress. I've seen data on hundreds of thousands of them over the years. Be smart. Protect your SS. Investing in stocks is less secure.
997 2018-11-04 04:10:37 sadly no listed stocks to play this theme
998 2018-11-04 04:09:52 NOVEMBER....

999 2018-11-04 04:09:46 Yea but only as an investor, I’ve been learning options this year and the trader in me wants to short the F out of the market, tech stocks in particular.
1000 2018-11-04 04:07:48 Obama said that 4% GDP was unattainable and that those jobs were gone.Cutting taxes and regulations has brought those jobs back with higher wages. “Magic Wand” has been located by Trump.

1001 2018-11-04 04:07:46 Agree with CJ - I’ve found there to be plenty of value in +.10-.30 trades given 3k-10k share positions. Not all stocks can accommodate that comfortably but can make $1-2k per trade without much hassle.

1004 2018-11-04 04:04:49 USA does need me. And all politicians think only themselves. But you can’t argue against high stocks, more jobs, and lowest unemployment rate. So I’m voting Red to make America free!
1005 2018-11-04 04:03:54 Ya but most of it are old stocks

1015 2018-11-04 03:49:19 What a bunch of CRAP! You got $9900. Russian laundered NRA donation. Aren't you proud? Dems have NEVER voted to take away your guns. They have suggested common sense protections backed by 83% Americans including NRA members! What's wrong with banning bump stocks?
1016 2018-11-04 03:47:27 Who's making all that money? China doesn't seem to be able to safely return high%long term due to Unionization, universal health care costs, and unregulated pay offstime will tell, ring the bell, stocks just fell, need a well
1017 2018-11-04 03:45:37 Bump stocks do not make a rifle fully auto matic. They aid in bumpfire, which is still semi-automatic and does not require a bumpstock.

You cannot buy conversion kits on the internet.

1020 2018-11-04 03:44:38 An asset bubble is when the price of an asset, such as housing, stocks, or ​gold, become over-inflated from investors bidding up the price beyond any real sustainable value. Agree?

1024 2018-11-04 03:41:33 I think the biggest confusion comes from the thought of what market cap means for stocks.  With a typical company their stock is worth how much profit and/or future profit the company brings in. With crypto it’s the value of the problem the coin is solving, which can be huge!

1033 2018-11-04 03:27:56 If this were an Obama admin, everyone would be yelling about how stocks have flattened and job growth is slowing. But Trump has his own machine declaring it miraculous and people just say okay, great!
1034 2018-11-04 03:27:43 on this week's On The Media, @LilyMasonPhD says the main thing keeping the US out of civil war is our ongoing prosperity. But it's such a bubble — these tech stocks are holding everything up, and they are obviously not worth their market caps.
1035 2018-11-04 03:27:32 a sadly conned #cult by the most divisive potus we have ever had who has blown up the deficit to give 1% a tax break to buy back stocks. That's Losing
1036 2018-11-04 03:25:56 No. Not BS. Just not good. Stocks are currently overvalued as opposed to predicted earnings over the next year. And much of this started well before the election. Trump is just adding to the instability.
1037 2018-11-04 03:25:33 I don’t know if I likebthe bud knight, but I do like watching him put the beer prick in the stocks
1038 2018-11-04 03:24:58 Ys good , I also don’t trade sin stocks

Point is:
USA Thriving under Trump!
1040 2018-11-04 03:19:28 the S&P is BELOW its 200 day average...that means about a year since stocks do not trade two days of the week...we are now below the year's average...and blue chips like Ford and Cat and Boeing are taking hits due to trade

It’s good in some instances, but in others it literally takes your stocks (especially when you’re interruped).
1047 2018-11-04 03:13:57 And, there are numerous acidic lines of dialog delivered w/ real gusto by a varied ensemble. The changing film stocks and aspect ratios, while novel, at first, quickly become grating. I guess, the real triumph of the film, is Michel Legrand’s score. (3/3)

1059 2018-11-04 02:57:06 If corporations buybacks are pushing stocks higher how were they going higher for 10 straight years. It couldn’t have been corporate buybacks. And if stocks continue to go higher indefinitely will we say its corporate buybacks or will we say some fraudulent force is propping them

1065 2018-11-04 02:47:42 @BellatorMMA @ufc @UFCONFOX @ONEMMA_ACADEMY @LFAfighting since trades are legal then the price of fighters stocks should go up, also people out side the organization should be able to invest in their stock on a level of sponsorship which isn't know & still reap the benifits amen
1066 2018-11-04 02:46:45 Well you do know the Dow is down since it’s high point in January 18. So this year my 401k is down. I do know that the Dow went up 210 percent under Obama from its low point March 09. So yeah it crushed under Obama. 2017 it continued under Trump but 2018 stocks are down.
1067 2018-11-04 02:46:07 Difficult comparison though, weed market did have a large demographic of young ppl who are traditionally disinterested in buying stocks
1068 2018-11-04 02:45:02 Reason is, Valuation of 40-50x their EPS is not justified as their revenue is growing at less than 10%. Market is giving lower valuation. These stocks may correct further or stagnate here for a longer period.
1069 2018-11-04 02:42:22 Everybody’s going out tonight then there’s me. In my room, listening to r&b, trying to figure out how stocks work

1071 2018-11-04 02:39:35 If treasury yields start providing better returns than stocks investors will leave stocks for guaranteed locked in rates of return. 

If you could buy a treasury note that yielded 5% or more for 5-30 years that's a pretty decent return that beats inflation with little risk.

1075 2018-11-04 02:37:16 My algo posts top stocks to watch on this feed M-F after the market closes.  In order for a stock to go up 100%+ it has to trend.  I looked at characteristics of winning stocks and boiled down the key elements into this scanner. If leading stocks are under 30, the market is weak.

1077 2018-11-04 02:29:03 No shit really? I gave that as 1 example! It does include over 30 of top traded stocks so its gives a pretty good idea of how things are doing. It just dropped 608 pts last week but regained 459 points the next day to bring it back up to over 25k.  A level never seen!
1078 2018-11-04 02:28:50 I don't know if this is at all how stocks work but you should have the majority share of them in Twitter now.

1082 2018-11-04 02:15:42 I'm not certain, but it could be a Starbucks effect, among others. The company moves stocks around the region and, at least theoretically, that may have a demonstrational impact on entrepreneurs. 

The gov't seems to be discouraging coffee imports with a 10% duty.  It's curious.

1098 2018-11-04 01:49:06 America seems been out of carrots stocks,because the American policy so far is all stick and no carrot, the worst of it is that all its adversaries are trying to adjust to the new situation without making a fuss

1101 2018-11-04 01:47:23 Very sad. I just read the obituary for Maggie Haughton. In the late 80s and early 90s she was my trader at First Marathon. One of the best on Bay Street. She used to complain I only gave her difficult stocks to trade. I told her why waste your skills on trading Bell. RIP Maggie.
1102 2018-11-04 01:47:11 Most people get interested in stocks when everyone else is. The time to get interested is when no one else is. You can't buy what is popular and do well.
1103 2018-11-04 01:46:38 @GiveBloodNHS I see 0- stocks are still very low. So frustrating that it’s so hard to get an appointment to give blood that suits me. I would give blood as often as possible. But can never get an appointment in the lakes

1106 2018-11-04 01:44:31 Yeah, I was thinking the stocks would be lesser than that of the main stores and probably sold out... 
1107 2018-11-04 01:43:46 stocks rise by 1%.
1108 2018-11-04 01:42:53 Dog stocks like KRC almost hit a $200M MC. Value hard to predict!
1109 2018-11-04 01:42:24 Am I wrong to be optimistic things will move up after Tuesday? I felt if the Rs hold the houses it would anyway but then I read the best period to make profit on stocks missionary style was between the 4th qtr of a Presidents 2nd year and the 1st/2nd quarter of his 3rd year.
1110 2018-11-04 01:39:58 You're getting dragged bro. Why not just go back to your super important and high class life trading stocks and running an illegal PI firm?

Oh you can't? Bummer...
1111 2018-11-04 01:38:18 If so, it'll be the "Dumb and Dumber" session! Sell your stocks, get ready for a recession!
1112 2018-11-04 01:36:20 And what does overcrowding (e.g. urban Los Angeles) do for the local environment?  Higher rent, lower housing stocks, overcrowded living spaces, intense traffic, more trash, more homeless- you would import more poverty then to California, which has the highest poverty in  U.S..
1113 2018-11-04 01:34:49 Democrats will destroy more than just the economy, stocks, jobs, etc., they will destroy the whole country, just like what been happening throughout Europe.
1114 2018-11-04 01:34:15 Well, the investments I made in oil stocks recently are all down near 52 week lows. I may have lost ya in all my verbiage. I sold a pink dog I invested in 9 years ago that I thought I would never see a penny back from for $17,xxx

1129 2018-11-04 01:15:26 Isn’t this a little understandable? MC >is< the $ that have been put up for stocks etc. since this is not a stock maybe another term is needed. ‘Currency valuation’? Market valuation?What is it called with the total value of a specific fiat is called a sum value? @galgitron

#Pharma stocks and #Tobacco stocks will rise (again) once @SGottliebFDA coordinates with the #Media #FakeNews blitz and tweets his own announcement himself.
1132 2018-11-04 01:11:51 1 key difference (thankfully) is that cannabis companies have to report earnings & we're going to get our first read on how strong sales were since Oct 17th & guidance of how demand will increase going forward. Weed stocks will recover & go much higher it's a fabulous industry.
1133 2018-11-04 01:11:47 Yeah all my stocks ended in the green except @4CE I’m going long 

Apart for trading it was my birthday and went out with some mates on Friday

1135 2018-11-04 01:09:54 People need to realise a digital asset does not conform to conventional metrics reserved for shares/stocks. It would be like applying marketcap metrics to Oil or Gold. Fear and greed are what motivate price movements for now. There is no market cap ceiling.

1149 2018-11-04 00:54:52 Since WW II there’s never been a 5 year stretch with negative market returns. Take out what you’ll need 5 years from now and leave the rest in stocks. 8%+ average return since 1972.

1154 2018-11-04 00:47:09 The timing is hard mate, you could risk a small amount of your net worth and see how you go but its risky, better way is to diversify into US dollar and US stocks via ETFs like ASX listed $IVV and $IRU

1156 2018-11-04 00:46:31 I'm long several weed stocks but this sounds exactly like what the bitcoin bulls were saying during Q1 when BTC was imploding. On the contrary retail investors can buy & hold forever it's institutions that have high position turnover because they need to perform every qtr/year.

1159 2018-11-04 00:44:57 do you reckon it’s a good time to short sell bank stocks. And then buy them back later for profit. It seems like GFC 2 is getting closer.

1164 2018-11-04 00:35:34 how much will this affect the stock market Sam? Given that corporate debt is ridiculously high -I suspect it’s going to hurt investors (especially retirees taking on risky stocks), businesses and employment. All on top of a deflating property bubble. What could possibly go wrong!

1167 2018-11-04 00:32:58 @RealJamesWoods Best Seller was a killer movie. “You have got balls my friend “. Thank you for speaking the truth about EVERYTHING!  If you don’t like your country being safe, higher wages,tax cuts, stocks, move.

1175 2018-11-04 00:18:08 No one asked but through accounting I’ve been starting to understand stocks. I never would’ve thought. I’m glad tho cause I genuinely wanted to get into stock trading and shit.
1176 2018-11-04 00:17:34 Might just fuck around and use the stocks app
1177 2018-11-04 00:17:16 I'm quite tired of hearing how great the economy is. Sure, if you have stocks, if you're wealthy. Unemployment numbers seem great but wages are stagnant. Folks working 2 & 3 jobs. Groceries going through the roof. Gas $3 a gallon. Utility bills go up. What's so great? #VoteBlue
1178 2018-11-04 00:16:18 Sell your stocks NOW.
Biggest stock market crash in history if DEMOCRATS win.
1179 2018-11-04 00:15:16 Its pretty reasonable to say the risk you make in being love with someone is similar as you do as investing in stocks. You have to go in with the mindset that you might lose everything. All your energy, time and effort.

1187 2018-11-04 00:06:10 I think what others have pointed out is that in cannabis stocks you are playing with fire getting stopped out constantly.
1188 2018-11-04 00:04:21 Stocks are a great way around a lot of things. See also the cap gains tax indexing proposed changes.
1189 2018-11-04 00:02:29 *not "day traders" with $1200 stacks, im talking about people with actual money

people with a few million dollars in assets don't sell stocks for groceries
1190 2018-11-04 00:02:03 My point being they are complicit in the fraud as well. But not all blockchain is fraud, 99% of crypto’s are the equivalant of 1980’s penny stocks pumped by snake oil salesmen but there is still potential in the blockchain infrastructure.
1191 2018-11-04 00:00:50 People sell stocks for all kinds of reasons, including to purchase goods and services of a wide variety of prices.
1192 2018-11-04 00:00:15 Keeping an eye on Chinese stocks. Still super oversold and ready to make a come-back anytime. Watch $FXI to look for a follow-through day on good volume next week. Still well-behaved last Friday: $BZUN, $ATHM, $NOAH, $BILI, $YUMC (earnings Monday), to name a few

Because """the economy""" means "stocks and bonds".

1264 2018-11-03 23:00:26 Where are the investor dollars going? The ASX has performed pretty abysmally. I'm guessing bonds and international stocks?
1265 2018-11-03 23:00:02 Mumbo's mustache was taken because of the magic of vintagebeef
The story goes:
He is said to of become inactive due to a mystic force haunting him. The unbeknow force gave him magic abilities that no one had ever heard of.
VintageBeef only vistis Hermitcraft when the stocks need
1266 2018-11-03 22:59:00 I keep forgetting to buy those Alcan stocks. Tinfoil usage has to be on the upswing.
1267 2018-11-03 22:56:59 In high priced stocks yes. In low priced stocks with big liquidity no. I know plenty of traders who scaled this with incredible success.
1268 2018-11-03 22:56:54 I’d say at this point let’s agree to disagree. I don’t know a single individual who owns an automatic & I go to a shooting range weekly. The only thing I know about bump stocks is the left liberal hysteria talking points on it
1269 2018-11-03 22:56:24 For those not familiar with OZ's they allow you to defer any capital gain on any investment stocks, cars, art, coins etc. and place it in a low income community as an investment in businesses or development.  If you keep the money their for 10 years your gains tax burns down.
1270 2018-11-03 22:53:22 @StocksTryHarry oh you meant Warren buffet? No but stocks go up and down regardless of big time investors
1271 2018-11-03 22:51:38 Because all these newspapers are own by corporations or have public stocks with shareholders and CEOs, so they're pretty much a for-profit company. And they'd never advocate for their own destruction.
1272 2018-11-03 22:51:37 This is the bottom....if there’s no selling by lunch Monday, we should start rising....all long hold stocks are suffering due to inactivity... $byoc $rxmd $argq etc...if it’s not a microfloat or cbd/hemp/mj (or the next flavor of the month) it basically gets little attention atm
1273 2018-11-03 22:50:29 For those not familiar with OZ's they allow you to defer any capital gain on any investment stocks, cars, art, coins etc. and place it in a low income community as an investment in businesses or development.

1280 2018-11-03 22:45:07 Numbers were on the decline. Stocks on decline. Hope and change show up in 2016 and both side don’t like him.

1282 2018-11-03 22:43:02 I am half aroused & seeking the truth of time, as I watch love and hate trading barbs like Wall Street’s index ascension sold on penny stocks by old car salesmen. To the booth we go in the rage of change, while the hobos loiter in the streets dressed as politicians.

1296 2018-11-03 22:28:36 Me parece que hay stocks exportable que aún no se han desarrollado a pleno, que en breve nos van a sorprender...
1297 2018-11-03 22:26:37 Norway Sovereign Wealth Fund created under Conservative government!!, taxed companies extracting oil from Norwegian waters. SWF now worth>US$ 1.1 trillion, owns 1.3% global stocks, 2017 earned US$131 billion. Aust mining tax became partisan debacle, public robbed
1298 2018-11-03 22:25:21 Those numbers were all already on an upward trajectory so I doubt trump had much to do with that. The tax cuts were largely used by companies to buy back their own stocks instead of pay increases or more hiring as we were told they’d be.
1299 2018-11-03 22:24:58 U poor things. Hv u the stocks ready so she can hang her head in shame. Bet tht £ for DWP to support UC ppl transfer will never meet her criteria so can lie to Gov saying ‘ told u the public did not need it ‘ lies!
1300 2018-11-03 22:23:53 #termstoknow IPO (Initial Public Offering) - The first time the stock is available to the public. #StockMarket #investors #stocks
1301 2018-11-03 22:19:18 British brewers can fill the gap. Cut beer duty and VAT, lay in more stocks of barley, hops and yeast and away we go. Mine’s a pint, thank you. 
1302 2018-11-03 22:19:11 A Semi Auto will only fire as fast as you pull the trigger, bump stocks don’t count. They were designed for people who are disabled. They have a binary trigger but how many of those do you see? But those weren’t full autos, I’m saying find me an instance that a full auto was used
1303 2018-11-03 22:17:32 #ALGW

My TOP 4 stocks to see EXPLOSIVE moves next week.

1. ALGW

2. NUOG

3. OEX

4. PREM

Many will think the list is CRAZY but i believe all 4 could EACH easily BAG
Or more

Think next week will be an EXPLOSIVE WEEK in the 4 stocks

1306 2018-11-03 22:08:43 Ban bump stocks
1307 2018-11-03 22:07:16 Many of them have personal wealth from stocks as well as those sweet donation checks to think about, that's why.
1308 2018-11-03 22:07:09 Not sure today will mean a huge amount for the selection at all. McGrath and Carbery's stocks may have dropped slightly but not to the extent I'd think Cooney and Byrne would be on the bench next week
1309 2018-11-03 22:05:56 yves nation stocks are back up . sorry for the worry
1310 2018-11-03 22:04:36 I’ve been cleaning up my portfolio for the past few months. Finally got my portfolio down to just 6 stocks. I owned up to 25 at one point lol  

The only stocks i own at this point are:

$NIO
$MEDH
$BDCI
$VRED
$PLFM
$PRPM (no bid so cant sell lol but .00005 avg at least)
1311 2018-11-03 22:04:22 It is quite good. I am sure that there is a Euro grocer near you somewhere that stocks it.
1312 2018-11-03 22:04:00 I think it also shows that tripple down economy tax cuts are just nonesense cause corps only byback there stocks instead of investment in jobs.
1313 2018-11-03 22:02:50 Then ur gonna have to throw down with @freeasmyfahad first to 100 stocks to declare dominance

1316 2018-11-03 22:01:04 Wealth vs Income will always confuse these people. Jobs was paid $1/year but got lots of stock options. He didn’t get paid until he sold the stocks. I bet it is the same with Bezos. Amazon’s stock went up and Bezos is worth more but if Amazon’s stock crashes then Bezos is broke.
1317 2018-11-03 22:00:28 Stocks, and Crypto.

1321 2018-11-03 21:57:02 More than $7 trillion has been returned to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends since the bull market started in March 2009, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. That’s equivalent to 40 percent of the value that stocks in the S&P 500 Index added during that stretch.

1324 2018-11-03 21:54:58 Weed stocks still double/tripled for another year after everyone was talking about them. But agreed, start your exit plan when JoeShmoes are recommending uranium stocks. Also when the # pubco’s skyrockets to multi 100s again.
1325 2018-11-03 21:54:28 Why in the world would market cap affect a cryptocurrency? Caps for cryptos don't measure assets or profit potential like with stocks, they're literally just a tool of measurement.
1326 2018-11-03 21:53:22 If you set off a display firework (banger)  in a residential area you should be placed in stocks and pelted with rotten hen fruit
1327 2018-11-03 21:52:31 Btw if it was not clear - I don’t think anyone should buy coins or bitcoins or invest in anything to do with crypto - it’s to soon and un-investable and there will be a lot of changes - so stay away completely it’s like all the “internet stocks” 1999 it’s a 100% scam, for now

1336 2018-11-03 21:35:51 Indeed. 

Having everyone repeat “strong and stable” over and over ... and over ... again turned them into laughing stocks. 

And that was before the u-turns.

1340 2018-11-03 21:28:04 Smart move by Coke.
1. Wait for US legalization. Don’t buy Vancouver stocks.
2. Then, let others try and fail.
3. Finally, around 2025, buy a couple of the Top-5 winners.

Adoption of the “Two-Joint Lunch” may or may not happen.  Smart to wait and see what the real market is.
1341 2018-11-03 21:22:49 Always exceptions to the rules when it comes to owning bonds. If you are older or closer to retirement, there is no need to get greedy and get overweight stocks, a guaranteed return will do fine for wealth preservation along with Gold.

1358 2018-11-03 21:01:40 You should delete this post. I’m embarrassed for you. It clearly shows you are as ignorant as investors can possibly be. I’m scared you might think all stocks have the same number of outstanding shares also. #XRPInvestorsLOL
1359 2018-11-03 21:01:01 correct, although there will be one short spike up - when the corporations buy their own stocks again - then roller coaster ride down 50-80% drop down for all.......

1368 2018-11-03 20:44:12 Well like I mentioned before BI and SA are the only guys covering small cap stocks so they are obvious choices to easily fill a news feed.

It's just a shame they have no editorial integrity. If RH didn't use them, there wouldn't be much of a feed.
1369 2018-11-03 20:43:31 Many good ideas have unforeseen consequences. Years ago some bright spark deigned that net holes should be larger to let more of the small fish escape and increase stocks. The opposite happened. The small fish were runts and the studs were caught and stocks fell.
1370 2018-11-03 20:42:19 Stocks down to less than 1% increase since Trump took office and that is most likely dividend. Strange idea of a better economy.
1371 2018-11-03 20:42:06 I think wild salmon stocks need to rise not for profits but for biodiversity, planetary health. It's the farmed salmon that are for greed and profit, and are harmful environmentally. Might @GeorgeMonbiot (who I greatly admire) support seal-culls to help wild salmon?
1372 2018-11-03 20:41:50 2) So down first and then the all out blitz to save the economy one last time into the mid 20’s stocks soar then collapse in a debt bomb destruction in the second half of the 20’s.
1373 2018-11-03 20:40:44 Sorry for follwing your lead and picking 2nd half who wins game...oh this is better than stocks...thanks Clay
1374 2018-11-03 20:40:19 I agree some people will pick stocks regardless. But I've seen the pattern I described many times, including Hallam and 1996 Motley Fool Investment Guide. Stock-picking sections should start with "This will almost certainly lose you money" and "just try to limit damage."
1375 2018-11-03 20:40:17 I never paid for a single course in my life... I learned trading from babypips and YouTube videos. I trade forex and stocks. I don't teach anyone anything. I trade... Traders trade, scammers scam
1376 2018-11-03 20:39:56 If you have any extra money you should consider buying some cannabis stocks. But be careful and do your research! It could be a big success though.
1377 2018-11-03 20:38:11 I think stocks vs flows thinking should be mandatory in elementary school.

Blizard: Just now is shitty

Trump: has been shitty for 3 years

You need an explanation as to why Trump JUST NOW made Blizzard shitty.
1378 2018-11-03 20:37:08 Now that stocks are down for the year, glad to see Berkshire Hataway is using their tax cut to have their companies give their workers raises... oh wait, instead they are buying back a billion in stock.. I’M SHOCKED! 
1379 2018-11-03 20:36:51 @IBDinvestors Some stocks LGIH back at 7, CLF at 6, more recent short of THOR above 120. Many others. CERS was at 3.5, I just strongly recommended  ENPH under 4.5.  I require no salary but consider an incentive on NET performance. I also like BSTI but on hold with China impact.
1380 2018-11-03 20:35:59 Is that the cash they took from the shareholders? How can you go bankrupt, seize shareholders stocks and then brag about a sizeable bankroll? Screw me once, shame on me....

1385 2018-11-03 20:28:55 Yo Doe! I've been doing my research on penny stocks for a couple weeks now. I haven't found anything worth my time. Can you throw me a solid penny stocks or give me some pointers on what to look for My G?

1387 2018-11-03 20:26:40 Prepping the Sunday update for members.  Sunday update consists of various  ETF's and stocks. Overall analysis of some and also opportunities going into the week. DM for details. For a very low price you get a lot of detailed info on a daily  and weekly basis
1388 2018-11-03 20:26:03 Have sympathy.  But can lead to very intrusive state.  Also how to distinguish between this and betting on stocks.
1389 2018-11-03 20:25:55 Plus the equity portfolio is full of bank stocks.
1390 2018-11-03 20:25:11 Also Apple Watch S3 and older iPads. Maybe these wind down stocks until Spring and some disappear, others refresh
1391 2018-11-03 20:25:06 That's where I disagree.  Bitcoin can't be used for many things that XRP can (e.g. bank transfer, remittances, etc.).  You can't compare the market caps between coins because they have different purposes.  Like comparing the stocks of IBM and your local shoe store.
1392 2018-11-03 20:24:59 @IBDinvestors I am a follower and offer fundamental feedback at a local IBD group in Riverside, Calif.  I would love to write a column regarding 
strong future fundamental stocks. My most current are CERS since it was 3.5 and NOW ENPH.. about to break up from H&S on the SPWR news
1393 2018-11-03 20:24:29 Funny thing.. weed became legal.. and the world didnt end... and pot stocks actually dropped opening day lol
1394 2018-11-03 20:23:19 2009-2017 was a tremendous reversal of the economic free-fall handed to Obama, followed by record steady growth & deficit reduction. 

The sugar high of corporate tax cuts & irresponsible deregulation is wearing off (see stocks); the insulin spike of $1T new deficits is coming.
1395 2018-11-03 20:21:29 Seen the shelter with bed for every night , very disappointing to find it without washing facilities , and  no stocks of  essential supplies , get the referels in and it’s going to stink when 20 unwashed men are in ! @clarefallon @SpinMcr @streetskitchen @MayorofGM @MENnewsdesk
1396 2018-11-03 20:20:57 But i think rent in good and safe areas of Brooklyn will continue to rise(It is rising in bad area also though).I think ,so far, stocks ,gold and BTC (after that bear market is over) is less stress investment.
1397 2018-11-03 20:20:03 Any advice on stocks?
1398 2018-11-03 20:19:10 He’s in the Stocks section because I trust him less than Woods, but the Rams are undefeated and doing fine without him; they wouldn’t risk his health if he wasn’t ready.

And the matchup against P.J. Williams is so damn good...
1399 2018-11-03 20:18:51 @replyall Love the show.  Take a look at escheatment.  It's the policy where government can take stocks if they can't locate you. We were victims.  Lost original Apple stock.
1400 2018-11-03 20:13:38 Market cap means nothing towards traditional stocks, with crypto it does
1401 2018-11-03 20:13:25 Exactly—I mean, even you must agree we should ban bofa stocks for guns based on their name alone
1402 2018-11-03 20:13:17 He hasn’t managed to fuck yo the exciting yet. Good on him. Stocks were already rising under Obama. So was the unemployment rate. But trump dismantled d frank so we’ll see. Trickle down economics doesn’t work for the long term.

1407 2018-11-03 20:10:39 Agreed. It takes the mistakes of classical economics ( the rational actor with infinite knowledge and an almost religious rejection of stocks and flows and actual money ) and replaces the rational actor with a clean room.

1409 2018-11-03 20:09:05 That you are correct about. Some people have this itch to pick stocks that I cannot comprehend.
1410 2018-11-03 20:08:08 *won’t pick stocks...
1411 2018-11-03 20:07:54 I think your worry is warranted. To many people low-cost indexing is what you do if you don't have the time or expertise to pick stocks. 

It takes a certain amount of knowledge (or repeated experience losing money) to realize that is not the case.
1412 2018-11-03 20:07:25 Certainly wasn’t my intention. The guide was more along the lines of Andrew Hallam’s original Millionaire Teacher and the chapter for those who can’t help themselves but to pick stocks. 

Even as indexing advocates we can’t pretend a large portion of investors will pick stocks.
1413 2018-11-03 20:07:23 I have done as you bid Ninja Lady; and told all my churls and servants to do same. This straw man of the Rus #Bankski must be opposed; ridiculed in the public stocks, and then imprisoned. I hope he dislikes porridge!
1414 2018-11-03 20:06:19 I’m pretty sure we’ve hit more *often* on the Locks, but we’ve hit *bigger* on the Stocks, which seems to make sense.
1415 2018-11-03 20:05:22 Nobody knows for sure.  I’m long a few stocks we will see.
1416 2018-11-03 20:04:08 just a lot of bad luck lately, really should go back to daytrading fulltime than investing. I held 3 stocks through #ESMO18 #ESMO2018 and all 3 got obliterated. now probably holding another 3 into #SITC18 #SITC2018 and some probably into #ASH18 #ASH2018
1417 2018-11-03 20:00:50 I agree, that summer price spike and high volume was probably attributed to everyone FOMO’ing into Chinese tech stocks. A parabolic rise and then steady decline. This chart looks very similar to bitcoin from late 2017 and on.
1418 2018-11-03 20:00:38 I won't pretend to have a high degree of confidence in the timing of this prophecy, but I'll go out on a bit of limb all the same and predict that US stocks, the DXY, and US 30Y bond prices will all be lower and gold higher on 12/31/2018 than they are now.
1419 2018-11-03 20:00:02 Anyone can acquire the know-how for analyzing #stocks.
1420 2018-11-03 19:59:13 i do quite like a few of the commodity stocks. rio tinto and anglo american being at the top of that list. commodity plays should be big as the single instance risk is pretty high in that area and failure is swift and brutal. long gold anyway as inflation increases. silver!

1422 2018-11-03 19:58:26 No Matt it didn't. It put more money in the pockets of the top 1%. They in turn bought back their own stocks and didn't trickle down any increase in wages. Duh.
1423 2018-11-03 19:57:43 At this point, doubting your picks would be blasphemy. That being said, my question is about your record. Why do you think the good stocks come out better than the locks?

I might agree on that for very large cap stocks, but certainly not for the vast majority of bio
1428 2018-11-03 19:54:11 Real returns on stocks, bonds, most financial assets were extremely negative during the 70s.
1429 2018-11-03 19:53:13 Is there value in UEC stock now? Is it greater or less than what it was? Is it greater or less than current trading price? 

I don't know. I have my opinions, but would suggest that it's really really hard to pin down "value" for junior mining stocks. $UEC

1435 2018-11-03 19:48:33 The no-lose scenario for stocks after the midterms
1436 2018-11-03 19:46:29 Yes, it was. But the data he compares includes those bad times for stocks, but doesn't include the bonds. The paper doesn't support what the headline purports, that bonds beat stocks over the long run.
1437 2018-11-03 19:44:21 The market is okay because the Corporation are buying back thier stocks. Then it went down so they started buying bonds. It's doesn't have anything to do with us. I will start tanking soon. 
This country is on credit  has been for long time.
1438 2018-11-03 19:43:10 Ya it is stocks in yearly minus so far lost 50000 dollars assholes

1447 2018-11-03 19:39:22 Since early '18 that I've seen countless tweets asking "Who the hell is buying bonds here?" Stocks too as the world crashed yet we soared. You've answered that question.

Think we'll see BIG fiscal stimulus by any means necessary.
One of your scenarios presents the justification.
1448 2018-11-03 19:39:15 Corporate welfare isn't the same as corporate taxes. Did you know the majority of corporations used the tax breaks to buy back their corporate stocks and shares which increases the net wealth of the owners/share holders. If I can invest an extra 20 million a year...
1449 2018-11-03 19:38:21 Does an equivalent of crypto twitter exists in normal markets? E.g. People shilling Penny Stocks claiming great fundamentals and road maps accompanied with basic TA, resulting in a nice pump and dump?
1450 2018-11-03 19:37:10 I thank you for your reply Learned Scribe. I suggested "stocks" to infer they might "share" them; and we lose the key. But public gelding might be a more fitting punishment, and taking their cattle, horses, chattels, and plate
1451 2018-11-03 19:36:48 We will focus on momentum stocks, ones with highest probablity to make profit within various timelines

1483 2018-11-03 19:07:51 It loves business insider, wsj, and seeking alpha who coincidentally hate Tesla. Don't use RH for market research.

Sources like BI and SA cover small cap stocks, but mostly shorts and day traders write the articles to move prices.
1484 2018-11-03 19:07:33 I swear if I don’t get rich from these stocks...
1485 2018-11-03 19:06:27 Same people who think stocks that trade at the highest prices are the most valuable companies.
1486 2018-11-03 19:05:40 patterns alone can’t guarantee success coz without volume confirmation they are useless,you have to combine chart patterns with volume and supply/demand, it’s  a puzzle you put the pieces together for the best outcome, track the stocks as I said and you will find them easily
1487 2018-11-03 19:04:57 No point to even say that. Since the beginning so many people were wrong. you ll never know. Beside we ll have a bubble like 2k with stocks and the price of bitcoin will be inimaginable

1493 2018-11-03 18:56:03 My thoughts: If the GOP can create an illegal tax scam to help billionaires buy back stocks and buy $40,000,000 yachts, then maybe the Democrats can come up with a legal way to help young adults drowning in student loan debts
1494 2018-11-03 18:55:28 Stocks are up artificially because of corporate buy backs and you know it. Or at least you should.
1495 2018-11-03 18:53:47 There is a big shock coming to utilities. Soon Uranium stocks will be recommended by your hairdresser...when that happens...sell and retire wealthy. This is the biggest contrarian play on the planet.
1496 2018-11-03 18:53:47 The DAY AFTER the election was when everything got better. Stocks soared!

Why?
1497 2018-11-03 18:53:10 I was not too much interested in trading stocks. All I learned about stock market was because I was studying accountancy and economics in school and had to search the internet. I also bought the book "The Intelligent Investor" but it started going above my head halfway through.
1498 2018-11-03 18:52:58 Cryptos have FDIC backed stable coins (Coinbase and Gemini), Stocks and IPOS are not FDIC insured. What the point?

1501 2018-11-03 18:50:39 None of this has anything to do with Brexit...

I've no savings due to cost of living.

1504 2018-11-03 18:48:20 Many define a ponzi scheme incorrectly- ie something that requires new buyers to boost the price. That definition applies to all assets including stocks, gold silver, real estate and bitcoin. IF no one bought them the prices would collapse, but that doesnt make them ponzi schemes
1505 2018-11-03 18:45:13 @StockGodd peace god... question? Do you trade both markets as well? Stocks and forex?
1506 2018-11-03 18:45:03 The stock market dropped because people fear the Fed will raise interest rates

Yet gold rose as stocks dropped, out of fear the Fed won’t raise because stocks dropped

Hmm wtf?
1507 2018-11-03 18:44:06 ASCENDANT FACTION stocks climb despite troubling geopolitical headlines
1508 2018-11-03 18:43:53 Even ganoncide got nerfed in ultimate because any person that plays ganon online and even for fun cheeses out stocks using it
1509 2018-11-03 18:43:05 The balance sheet looks very brim. When the baby boomers will retire the spending to the economy will drop by aprox 60%. Stocks will plummet , inflation will rise. There is not much equity in the market like baby boomers had. Milenials will have bigger challenges.
1510 2018-11-03 18:42:02 Agree, also in how many stocks did this happen

1513 2018-11-03 18:37:54 over 50% of the "people" own stocks in a 401K or some retirement account now a days. the better the market does usually means the better the retirements plans do & inflation is barely visible right now & more people are working now then ever before cannot fill over 1M jobs now
1514 2018-11-03 18:36:23 rail'yards 've been humming along n making repairs n smoke stacks 've been steaming. just sayin. w're in for a'better than post wwII boom. yup. ( hope y'bought railroad stocks)
1515 2018-11-03 18:35:07 If you just want to look at 10 years of bull market returns, put 100% in stocks and spent 10%/year and you'd be OK for the last decade. But doesn't mean that's sustainable through all market cycles. :)
1516 2018-11-03 18:33:59 Du pipeau vous n'y arriverez pas @murielpenicaud connaît bien le problème en tant que DRH elle ne l'a jamais appliqué dans l'entreprise où elle a encaissé ses stocks options.

1519 2018-11-03 18:30:04 were the weed stocks too high? 

I'll block myself.
1520 2018-11-03 18:27:45 “don’t get caught with your stocks down”
1521 2018-11-03 18:25:24 But even more worrisome are what are called 'stocks and sinks'--a 'sink' is how much the global ecosystem can tolerate a shock, for example, CO2 emissions. We can think of 'sinks' as a semi-fixed resource, kind of like oil.
1522 2018-11-03 18:25:24 Somebody check his stock ownership-bet he owns the same prison stocks the AG has.
1523 2018-11-03 18:24:31 Ah.....TOUGH! What a little shit he is.Oh,for a set of Stocks, he could sit in there & be spat upon & maybe have flour thrown at him? Along with rotten veg & anything else people can get their hands on. Hopefully learn some humility.
1524 2018-11-03 18:23:51 That’s it for eSIM coverage on my Twitter feeds. Back to stocks, tech and medicine. Hehe
1525 2018-11-03 18:20:35 When he @Smartertrader starts talking about “other” things besides stocks ONLY MEANS HE LOST AGAIN!!!!! How can you win with his peso option model ? Simple. Amazing. Lose your account with @Smartertrader @smarter411 #scam #fraud #beware
1526 2018-11-03 18:19:18 which exchange do you recommended for faangs/stocks?
1527 2018-11-03 18:17:43 Sir, hoping for the same with ADAG stocks as well.
1528 2018-11-03 18:17:07 If it’s similar to stocks I believe it’s capital gains no matter what, however the 1 year mark is a threshold for different tax brackets.
1529 2018-11-03 18:17:03 Some big accounts on here will complain about people posting 7.5%-15% trades

I don't understand this at all.

If you put in $10k and make a 10% trade you have $1,000

That's an incredible result and people trading stocks crave that. I'll continue to post movements like this 
1530 2018-11-03 18:15:28 Stocks plunged as Delta Air Lines, Inc. unveiled a ostentatious cement stone today.
1531 2018-11-03 18:15:04 And people this is why you can't trade stocks if you're too broke or stupid to get a trading account open.
Crypto is ruining dumb people. Sad.
1532 2018-11-03 18:14:31 Hanging, drawing and quartering, ducking stool, village stocks........
1533 2018-11-03 18:14:17 How are stocks going along ?
1534 2018-11-03 18:13:05 What this means? Other companies' stocks not worth buying? 
1535 2018-11-03 18:12:49 Are you a crack addict? My stocks have a 538% profit margin this year!
1536 2018-11-03 18:12:31 Not the first time! He’s trash-talked a lot of companies who’s stocks then fell. I wonder how many shares his people bought before the stocks went back up again?!!
1537 2018-11-03 18:11:51 Tesla Stocks won’t stay under 400 for long. In 20 years, everybody will be pushing towards electronic cars, them stocks finna be over 1000. JUST WAIT ON IT

1541 2018-11-03 18:04:20 Yeah..how's that ban on bump stocks that daddy promised.... One punch from a 60 year old won't kill anyone.
1542 2018-11-03 18:03:44 Thanks for the advice, I’ll consider this for sure, that’s kinda how I’ve got started. Playing some volatile stocks and putting gains in more stable stocks.
1543 2018-11-03 18:02:21 I will tell you that once my uranium stocks climb out of the basement!
1544 2018-11-03 17:59:50 Damn man my stocks dropped like a mufucka wth happened? Well Christmas coming so my shit should blow up again
1545 2018-11-03 17:59:46 seems your stocks are flying high
1546 2018-11-03 17:59:37 kids who invest in stocks are worse than vegans
1547 2018-11-03 17:59:02 Do you do any gluten free options? I find vegan options popping up almost everywhere now but hardly anyone stocks decent gluten free food - something that’s a dietary requirement rather than a choice too

1549 2018-11-03 17:56:31 Stocks would be ideal, not a big fan of public accounting, you get worn into the ground do the same thing over and over again with no sense greater scope for years when you are young.
1550 2018-11-03 17:54:25 We will come up with our Diwali Patakha Stocks by Monday Evening
1551 2018-11-03 17:53:58 Having said that - broadening the ownership of financial assets is a worthy goal. Really the top 20% of households should all have a stocks isa with non trivial amounts of money in it.
1552 2018-11-03 17:53:39 I sympathize with your situation. It’s terrible what Trump is doing to the auto industry. His lies add insult to injury. General Motors (GM) is down 28% from its peak last October. Auto and home sales, Home Depot, Lowe's stocks fall after analyst downgrades, downbeat housing data
1553 2018-11-03 17:52:30 They called in the best mate. Putting out fires. Something about a previous Scottish twat getting them into weed stocks at the wrong level  
1554 2018-11-03 17:52:30 Where is George lebese bantu ay pitso naye now we laughing stocks suka!!!
1555 2018-11-03 17:52:23 What the happens to US stocks if the dollar is reversing down?
1556 2018-11-03 17:51:08 Corporations are pretty sensitive to that. If even 15 % of voters did this corporations would panic and stocks would start dropping.
1557 2018-11-03 17:50:51 I guess you don't have stocks or had to pay Obama's tax for those that can't afford health care. Democrats are no longer for the poor. The are Globalist for the rich. With Trump the poor are working and getting off food stamps. Best President for the poor yet!!!
1558 2018-11-03 17:49:44 Crypto Macro # 1 - If the federal reserve increase interest rates, money will flow out of stocks & crypto and into savings account as it is far better to store money in banks than to invest in risky fianancial markets. Interest rates is King of Markets. $btc #crypto $eth $bitcoin
1559 2018-11-03 17:49:15 Yes protect your portfolio but do remember to buy when stocks are on sale. That adds to upside returns. For trading a good dip/correction strategy: always come off the bottom of dips or corrections holding more positions than you had at the top.
1560 2018-11-03 17:48:01 Thanks :)
And the new pot etf's? You think that is a good idea? Maybe less risky because they invest in different medical pot stocks
1561 2018-11-03 17:47:53 the exact same as stocks
1562 2018-11-03 17:47:30 It's a cash stash that banks change for you and invests it in stocks so that it gains interest.
1563 2018-11-03 17:47:29 Lol nah bro stocks is cool but forex hop on a call at 3 with my team and see how you like it ?
1564 2018-11-03 17:46:15 And stocks?
1565 2018-11-03 17:45:55 you have to invest in things where the volume is high and there’s a strong margin.
You can also sit on stocks that have a trend of going up. 
The more money you have to work with the more you can make.
1566 2018-11-03 17:45:24 Banyak nya stocks pickupline baru so nak kasi siapaa ni

1568 2018-11-03 17:43:28 Enjoy until it last but BTC is going nowhere. Stocks goes down, BTC goes down and gold goes up. Tells you story where smart money is going when this system goes...BTC is just not ready to deal with this crash. You will see and then no RS5 or shrimps for a while

1570 2018-11-03 17:43:00 Now that’s a real WTF moment. Hell, I trade marijuana options and stocks. Went to the F-ing bathroom and lost 4K by the time I got back. Reminds me of bitcoin days.
1571 2018-11-03 17:42:55 @puppytracks4 I’d like to do both. Invest in things like $AAPL $ARRY & $BAH, and also try and trade more volatile stocks too.
1572 2018-11-03 17:42:09 Been spending today learning about investment, stocks, ISA's, savings accounts... all that stuff I wish they'd teach you in school 
1573 2018-11-03 17:42:08 Does @Pornhub have stocks available for purchase, if the demand for coochie is null for November them shits gonna be worth more than bitcoins
1574 2018-11-03 17:41:12 It's become extremely obvious how much more focused on making more money and increasing stocks and lost all focus on the players. I've noticed the servers becoming far worse and queue times in @PlayOverwatch becoming minutes longer. I guess fewer servers.
1575 2018-11-03 17:38:57 Besides actually being able to ko and take stocks
1576 2018-11-03 17:38:11 There are many who look and see all kinds of shapes in the Charts. e.g. descending Triangle. Further they imagine that the prior bear market will be replicated. But have studies Stocks and charts for 30+ years. History is a poor predictor for 5X,10X,100X 1000x returns.
1577 2018-11-03 17:35:51 $SPX $BA $LMT $BIDU $BABA election scenarios republicans sweep then tech & defense stocks rip. Democrats sweep China stocks rip and $SPX craters. Houses split then more of the same. @smartertrader Thoughts?

1582 2018-11-03 17:32:32 Stocks are like kids on steroids. Screw the FED!  check the bond market. The fiat currency will bust. 99.99 percent depreciated. 21 trillion in debt another 21 trillion missing at least. Lots of gold and silver getting moved around right now.
1583 2018-11-03 17:32:20 prisons have no stocks??? what they use money like everything else.
1584 2018-11-03 17:32:20 Again, I love guns, we have plenty of assult rifles, drum mags, bump stocks, you name it.. I will give up that joy on the weekends of pulling trigger to stop mass shootings...
1585 2018-11-03 17:31:57 When you contract a folio, you should have some defensive stocks, Infosys and Auro are defensives.
1586 2018-11-03 17:31:47 No times for pictures but we have traded for a H-R handi-rifle with wood stocks in a 45/70.

1592 2018-11-03 17:24:21 Put my next 1k into stocks like a true capitalist or don’t because our stock market is so fucking mercurial I’m destined to lose 90% of my money? We lost 2 trillion last month so I’m kinda spooked 
1593 2018-11-03 17:24:04 Took me 2 years to where I can wake up and consistently profit from scalping specific stocks that fit my criteria. I have a 2nd account I use for swinging. Even though I'm mainly a scalper I would never recommend a new trader to even think about doing it. RR would be a mess.
1594 2018-11-03 17:22:38 thanks! .. for your appreciation .. always think of how best to guide markets ! ... in most stocks may already have Invested .. so do have vested interest !
1595 2018-11-03 17:22:24 That was a bad time for stocks too I bet. So we’re the 1890s
1596 2018-11-03 17:21:12 The year isn’t over. Perhaps you’re in the wrong stocks. My 401 alone is up 16% for 2018 and my individual stocks are all up and running between 8-32% growth, unlike 2009-15 when they averaged no greater than 4% at the highest mark and were in negative number for most of time.
1597 2018-11-03 17:21:12 Where are you on your bomber? Where are you on the Saudis murdering a US Journalist? Where is the money from Mexico for the wall? Where is the ban on bump stocks you promised? Where is YOUR health care plan? Where is the beautiful DACA bill you promised? Where is the 10% tax cut?

1601 2018-11-03 17:18:41 Increased $TCEHY to 14% of single stocks (new savings). It's my second largest after Berkshire now.
1602 2018-11-03 17:18:26 You know better than us but HDFC bank and kotak, both Pvt sector banks in one portfolio of 9 stocks. Having one of them replaced with an HUL will make it perfectly balanced.
1603 2018-11-03 17:17:33 40 factory stocks entered for the #AllAmerican60. We started 8th in heat race two and finished 2nd in 10 laps.That puts us in the pole for the $2500 today @JMSpeedway
1604 2018-11-03 17:16:06 Why would any person choose to be? Well, maybe those with a large portfolio of stocks.

I’m new to stocks and this is my current hand. Thoughts? Advice? I’d love some civil conversation
1606 2018-11-03 17:14:18 It's really, really hard to have expectations for the prospects of individual stocks. I'd probably call it a hope as opposed to an expectation, and hope is a tough thing to bet on. I agree with Robb - base decisions on expected returns.
1607 2018-11-03 17:14:03 Stocks will not be able to check for sometime.
1608 2018-11-03 17:11:49 yes but death threats are dumb, put him in stocks and chuck stuff at him

1615 2018-11-03 17:07:27 The wealthy are buying back stocks but that doesn't help the rest of us. My friends, coworkers and family have all felt the pain.. I've lost thousands in my 401k. I knew I shouldn't look but glad I did. All my gains washed away in less than a year. 
1616 2018-11-03 17:05:53 Yup... holds the majority of their stocks. 
Interesting how Netflix actually looks like the cover op for the Deep State

Anyone paying for Netflix is supporting the Deep State... that's just my observation though.
1617 2018-11-03 17:05:14 My friends ALWAYS were begging me to do that Facebook~ I NEVER EVER DID IT. So glad now. But it was weird~ I always had distrust in that social media site. It was a 6th sense and EVERYBODY thought I was just bein' paranoid! Then the Big Blow up Happened.
Now about those stocks?
1618 2018-11-03 17:04:53 Great choice of stocks sir
1619 2018-11-03 17:03:40 If you have stocks in the Buddy Holly Airport, I heard they plummeted yesterday…
1620 2018-11-03 17:03:03 I think you know what is trading and what is exiting stock!
You said they exited and went back to their country! I can’t see them exiting stocks however I can see they are still trading!!!!
1621 2018-11-03 17:02:52 For the first time I agree. The economy is on fire. 1.3 Trillion added to the debt. Farmers on welfare because foreign markets closed. Businesses closing or moving because they can't get raw material. Stocks crashing. The Trump depression is well on its way.

1637 2018-11-03 16:53:59 Physical is a LT investment 3-5 years or longer imho. Miners are a trade for a rally in Gold and Stocks alike over the next 1-2 years. I hold all physical today but for a couple of miners. Even when we get to the low in Gold, I'll load up miners but still only 10% vs 90% physical
1638 2018-11-03 16:51:48 If wealthy individuals use stocks, real estate.. etc for store of value purposes  then why is it inconceivable to say that upon a US market downturn that these same individuals would turn to bitcoin? $btc
1639 2018-11-03 16:51:36 Reading about paper sector. The dynamics of Indian paper sector is changing. Paper stocks are trading at reasonable valuations. There can be some positive surprises from this sector in future.
1640 2018-11-03 16:51:03 I’ve been buying micro-cap stocks
1641 2018-11-03 16:50:37 I urge the investing community to look at investing with the right paradigm. Please avoid looking at day trading and long hold investing as a game of price arbitrage! Alpha ROI will naturally come by investing only in business that add value to society! #investing #stocks #alpha
1642 2018-11-03 16:49:31 Hey, I've noticed that you use bar charts for some stocks and Heiken-Ashi candles for others. How do you decide between the two? Do you use regular candlestick charts at all? Thanks!

Unfortunately, this week’s bounce does absolutely nothing to negate the major technical breakdown that occurred last week...

1650 2018-11-03 16:45:55 You saw the stock market go up...and it’s heading right back down because all it did was give the wealthiest enough to buy their stocks back. Classic spike and fall.
1651 2018-11-03 16:45:06 Ah...stocks go up and down and up again. As long as people want to use natural gas...not worried.
1652 2018-11-03 16:44:07 I agree. I like to be know exactly where all my books are so I can find them and look things up quickly. I am currently having to prune and reorganise my book stocks after a difficult and busy few years when we have had to concentrate on other things. My favourite German phrase
1653 2018-11-03 16:44:01 You continue to rally because you know you're in trouble.  If Americans vote for you (red) they deserve what's coming.  Stocks will be in the red. America will be doomed.

1669 2018-11-03 16:32:59 Looking forward, any concessions during G20 will prove to have an enormous impact on the market. If no deal is struck, I see a systemic shift to value stocks and look to value small/mid-caps to outperform. If we reach a deal, a lot of earnings pressure will be relieved.

1686 2018-11-03 16:18:23 Was 2.6x sales when Trump won & 4x now. Services, yeah, but there are loads of stocks whose multiples reflect tax changes & multiple expansion due that "growth"
1687 2018-11-03 16:17:04 Siouxsie, lives on Aliso Rios with too many lizards.

Put all their savings into maca root stocks. Can't retire.
1688 2018-11-03 16:17:03 Disagree. All throughout Trading Tickers Tim Grittani is taking profits at these levels on low priced stocks.

1690 2018-11-03 16:15:14 WSJ: “Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Repurchases More Than $900 Million of Stock”
His 1st buyback since 2012. Speaks volumes about the high valuations prevailing in Q3. Nothing undervalued today, except #gold & #silver. Stocks & fiat currency most overvalued.
1691 2018-11-03 16:15:11 Activists claim they want to protect wild salmon stocks. They think hundreds of rail cars and now transport tanker trucks running oil down  the banks of the Fraser river  and on our highways through towns is safer than a pipeline. Wonder who they'll blame when thres a derailment

Nobody is there who can explain Indian Stock Exchange like BSE  and NSE and stocks with exlanation and analisys with breakout and breakdown indication and their targets.
Thanks and regards.
1693 2018-11-03 16:14:59 But yeah I saw the Berkshire article. Trump needs stocks high to justify trade war and oil low to justify Iran sanctions. The GOP will prop this sucker until it doesn’t work anymore, or they succeed and exhaust bears (which I think is less likely but still possible)
1694 2018-11-03 16:14:22 "i feel like zombie,to be exact." he wriggles his eyebrows playfully as he grins.

1695 2018-11-03 16:14:12 Stocks are up significantly since the election, this headline is misleading to your readers who don't understand P/E. The S&P is up roughly 25% since the election, and was up over 30% a few weeks ago. I agree that Trump's a moron and detrimental to the market/economy but come on.
1696 2018-11-03 16:11:18 Anyone that says socialized medicine has

Your gambling is about as overvalued as the stocks you invested in. You don’t produce,create,employ,build, nada
1699 2018-11-03 16:09:28 Matt, you seem to lie as easily as you breathe. You know you are lying but you simply do not care. What did corp's do with that windfall? They bought back stocks. And now we have a deficit over $1 TRILLION because of the GOP.

1761 2018-11-03 15:15:58 No u lie. But what is the truth is that the cost of gas insurance food utilities all increased 10-45% since trump took office the rich got Billions in tax cuts and bought back stocks. Then raised prices to take any tax break we had.
1762 2018-11-03 15:14:43 Great idea !! Maybe we could bring back stocks in town centres and put on the odd stoning or two whilst we are at it?

1766 2018-11-03 15:08:48 He needs to question the big tax scam that artificially cause stocks to go up and companies did exactly what many said they will do buy back stocks and now the country’s deficit is at a record high.
1767 2018-11-03 15:08:38 - Je laisse mes enfants manger leurs bonbons d'Halloween n'importe quand et autant qu'ils en veulent comme ça ça épuise les stocks plus rapidement.

1768 2018-11-03 15:08:34 I'm all for stricter background checks, as well as the bump stocks being banned. But after that I'm not sure what can actually be done. Most shootings are performed with illegal weapons anyway.
1769 2018-11-03 15:07:25 Remember...always buy low and sell high. Don't get caught with your stocks in the climate-change apocalypse.

1770 2018-11-03 15:06:58 Is it a period of time of lower lows and lower highs ?
For an example do most of technology stocks are in downtrend ?

1773 2018-11-03 15:06:06 Relative strength plus ichimoku.   Seems to be more reliable with stocks though.
1774 2018-11-03 15:06:06 So now the country is stuck with a slowing economy but a much larger debt pile than it had 10 years ago. Investors don't like what they see, and Asian stocks are hurting as a result.
1775 2018-11-03 15:05:30 Adding small/value stocks during accumulation can lead to > wealth or < required savings (1928-2018):

S&P 500 = +9.9%
Stock Asset Class Index* = +12.0%

In retirement, short-term bonds + stock asset class index = market returns w/less risk:

65/35 Asset Class Index** = +10.2%

1781 2018-11-03 14:58:12 Numbers over feelings.

When you show me an economic trend line that has IMPROVED under Trump, I will give him credit. Till then, I will credit ONLY OBAMA for the current UPWARD TREND of stocks, unemployment, wages, etc that he set in motion.

Numbers over feelings.
1782 2018-11-03 14:58:03 So far its all right, but ending stocks seen at only 650,000 T. I guess some local consumers will see shortages

1784 2018-11-03 14:56:37 Some choices in a volatile late stage bull market. 

1. All in stocks no matter what and take a loss. 

2. Try to time the top and sell short, probably unsuccessfully for most. 

3. Fool around with options for big losses for most.

4. Hold some cash and be protected either way.
1785 2018-11-03 14:56:30 The mid-term election outcome will have a significant impact on stocks over the next two years.
1786 2018-11-03 14:54:57 doubt this one come from old USSR stocks 
1787 2018-11-03 14:54:38 There's been this discourse about discounted-cashflow assets like stocks vs. store of value assets like gold/Bitcoin/alt-coin-wants-to-be.

But really a currency, irrespective of its inflation or deflation rate, is given value by the phenomena of cashflows through it.

1789 2018-11-03 14:50:36 I see. That makes sense too. Never traded a commodity either. Similar to stocks. Supply/demand or different animal
1790 2018-11-03 14:49:43 Look into getting some non-US exposure as you grow your investments. The Total World Stock Index Fund is a good one as well (even though it has underperformed US stocks).
1791 2018-11-03 14:46:59 "Thriving"? 43.1 million Americans are living in poverty. Millions living hand to mouth, no savings, maxed out on credit. Plenty of low paying jobs cause folks need 2 or 3 to survive. Vast majority of Americans don't own stocks. The only people thriving are the 1%.
1792 2018-11-03 14:46:28 Fact: trickle down economics doesn’t work, because corporations use tax breaks to buy back stocks.  STFU idiots who think this tax break did anything for the 99% of Americans.  Industries die as mankind evolves, history  proves this.  Other jobs are created as a result.
1793 2018-11-03 14:45:52 #Uranium update. @Ralph_Acampora taught me about fusion analysis - the convergence of fundamental, technical and quantitative factors. In many U names we are now seeing that.

1798 2018-11-03 14:42:45 I don’t think you understand how stocks work, given that you have resorted to personal comments re investors/Elon. If you want to join the light side, we always have room for more longs in the tribe.
1799 2018-11-03 14:40:59 Sheesh constantly blaming political parties..once again both sides own stocks in insurance. I would never vote all blue or red. Or black or white, we need the diversity in Congress, we don't want dictators
1800 2018-11-03 14:40:17 Simple steps for a smarter investment spending strategy:

1. Set asset allocation (desired risk/return)
2. Keep bonds short/high quality
3. Diversify globally and across small/value stocks
4. Rebalance with cash flows (spend stocks in bull mkts, bonds in bears)
5. Stay the course
1801 2018-11-03 14:38:36 Guns don't kill people they just make it easier to kill large amounts of people at one time. Now things like bump stocks or new binary triggers are not for hunting or any reasonable good and I feel should be banned as large clips. Who needs a 100 rounds clip or bump stock?

1807 2018-11-03 14:36:06 It's funny because in so many ways the value in Twitter and things like the WheelieBash we did a few weeks ago is in enabling peeps to discuss different approaches. I guess anyone can buy a basket of Stocks but managing them is quite an unknown art.
1808 2018-11-03 14:35:46 Dairy is directly linked to osteoporosis. Please look into who is funding the ‘studies’ you’re reading about 100% guaranteed they have stocks in or ties to animal agriculture. Even the FDA is full of people with money in that field, of course they’ll condemn veganism.
1809 2018-11-03 14:35:39 Stocks over the past 10yrs when the economy has been horrendous. That’s the question I want answered. And how can you invest when you see w your own eyes how corrupt the market is by going higher & higher x 10yrs when wages suck, benefits suck & there just aren’t any jobs

Ppl are barely paying their bills how are you suppose to have left over money to invest & more importantly why would you invest your blood money in a fraud system. How can u have justified buying -
1814 2018-11-03 14:33:29 Hello @timothysykes ! would you have a broker advised for non-US residents? because the penny stocks interest me strongly but in France it is difficult to find a good broker for traders the US shares that accepts the French :/
1815 2018-11-03 14:32:39 Even if Brent falls to $60, because industry costs (dayrates, etc.) have fallen so much, IOC's can still make good returns on invested capital.  In other words, with oil >$60-$65, IOC's have the means, motive, and opportunity to ramp spending. OFS stocks aren't pricing that in.
1816 2018-11-03 14:32:07 Telling dichotomy, 45's tax bill enables breaks for billionaires to buy back stocks, while everyone else struggles to pay for health care...
1817 2018-11-03 14:31:58 Unfortunately this is wrong. 
If you want to save the planet and stop climate change,The answer is simple, the best way you can help is don’t have children. Less people for the planet to feed=less consumption of the rain Forrest’s, sea stocks, plastics, oils etc. And plant trees.

1823 2018-11-03 14:28:02 It will be. Raiders will be laughing stocks for awhile but let’s see how Gruden drafts. He may be good at that.
1824 2018-11-03 14:26:45 If the Republican tax scam were reversed, and the poorest got the most, the economy would explode. The poor would not spend on tax shelters & stocks. They would spend on goods and services.
1825 2018-11-03 14:24:15 The LORD hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that ye should be officers in the house of the LORD, for every man that is mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put him in prison, and in the stocks. -Jeremiah 29:26
1826 2018-11-03 14:23:23 Stocks and the market is at near record highs. The US is now the world’s most competitive market. You absolutely can’t bash our economy right now it’s doing absolutely fine.
1827 2018-11-03 14:22:28 Beyond a slowdown they have fraudulently held up stocks to create an illusion that the economy is doing well. The bottom line is majority of the people are broke or barely surviving & that’s the way they want it. Trump is in on the sham they all are
1828 2018-11-03 14:22:01 Wall Street snaps three-day rally as Apple falls, trade optimism fades: U.S. stocks snapped a three-day rally on Friday as Apple shares dropped following a disappointing forecast and the White House dampened optimism over U.S.-China trade talks.
1829 2018-11-03 14:21:44 I won’t debate this. I can see it’s useless. I day trade stocks and options in the market all day. I eat, sleep and drink financial information. I have to. I’m not going to debate a fairytale

1831 2018-11-03 14:20:45 I always open positions in high volatility stocks by selling puts but I keep enough cash in case i get stock. That’s how I started building my TSLA position at $20.
1832 2018-11-03 14:20:10 @Hedgeye great podcast guys. Correct me if I’m wrong but you nailed the big pullback in high beta momentum stocks NOT the actual quad 4 poor data cause the bad data your predicting won’t be reported til Jan/feb. Am I missing something?
1833 2018-11-03 14:19:52 The supermarket stocks the shelves with inventory from its suppliers. If the suppliers violate the law with their goods, they are liable first of all, and not the supermarket.

1835 2018-11-03 14:19:05 Assuming (!!) that your confidence in the signals is the same, I think of it like combining stocks.  There is typically always value add, but there marginal value decreases the more signals you add.
1836 2018-11-03 14:18:30 Rich people don't buy low risk stocks. Why? Because they are too witty
1837 2018-11-03 14:17:58 I’m trying fuck with them stocks..
1838 2018-11-03 14:16:06 Crypto traders should dip their toes in #PotStocks and make for some of the 2018 losses. These stocks corrected dearly and will soon be back up. Canadian plays will be back up sharply after US midterms. US plays have taken the spotlight momentarily
1839 2018-11-03 14:16:05 The GE dividend debacle serves as a reminder: a) don’t own stocks just for the dividend b) understand and be confident in the underlying business - GE has always been in the “too hard” pile IMO c) diversify d) insist on adequate FCF cover on dividends (GE had no cover since 2015)

1844 2018-11-03 14:08:47 His older letters to shareholders have lots to say about how to handle an inflationary environment. One principle: own blue chip stocks that will be able to raise prices to keep pace with inflation. Guess nothing is bluer than Berkshire for Buffet.
1845 2018-11-03 14:08:44 Unfortunately not - although as a technical point Oates is depicted in a pillory (head and hands imprisoned) - stocks were where your feet are locked up. Not sure which you would prefer for your nominated prisoners...

1855 2018-11-03 14:01:41 You could also use more aggressive stocks like Apple which is up 18 times so that $500k would be $9 million or Amazon which is up 40 times so that $500k would be with $20 million.
1856 2018-11-03 14:00:05 Thanks, the next time one of my stocks miss their quarterly earnings I’ll be sure to contact the CEO and have him contact you on how he should spin it for a favorable outcome.. You guys are on fire this morning.

1859 2018-11-03 13:58:42 $500k 10 years ago invested in something stable like TD with a drip is worth $1.85 million today compared $1 million for a house. Shares would pay $68k in dividends annually. You can use leverage for both. No repair expenses on stocks, and dividends are taxed more favourably.
1860 2018-11-03 13:57:50 Expected after economy Obama handed you.  No great shakes just influx of temporary boost of military spending.  Tax cuts and trade wars are already directing us towards inflation and recession and stock market is reacting. Stocks down in 2018.
1861 2018-11-03 13:57:29 Stock market =/ economy! More than 70% of all stocks are owned by the richest 1%. Outside of a bump on some 401ks That does not benefit the majority in tangeable way and certainly does not mean the economy is working for everyone.

1877 2018-11-03 13:43:00 @smerconish policy doesn't cause a recession. Trade wars and over-priced stocks are always a factor.
1878 2018-11-03 13:42:27 If a stock open price and high price same and if it didn't cross high price in
Next  5 min
Such stock falls

If a stock open and low price same
And if it start trading above it for next 5 minutes then such stocks blast.

These all subject to normal market

2000 2018-11-03 11:33:19 You make some good points especially the spreading risk, but in my view  maybe a little too enthusiastic to buy when the prices initially go down.  Old saying don't try to catch a falling knife comes to mind.  Small stocks act more irrationally in a bear market.

2012 2018-11-03 11:19:58 Employment is up. Only a small proportion of what Obama did every single quarter. But, inflation is up, and wages are stagnant. The richest are collecting the difference. This was feeding a boom is stocks then they crashed, wiping out this years gains overnight

2016 2018-11-03 11:14:39 If You buy an authentic company stock from a proper dealer, etc., then other people print up their own stocks, and the TSX considered them all equal, your asset has been diluted by lack of market enforcement, not bad market performance.

2022 2018-11-03 11:07:58 You have to run an enterprise before getting Judgemental. Banks do not fund losses. Suppose unit goes in loss so Book Debt & Stocks limit will get hit. So unit will inflate both values hoping against hope unit will recover. But It is a gamble which will surely take him to jail

2024 2018-11-03 11:06:35 Always some debate over whether it is easier to pick funds than stocks.  I think funds are easier.  Because you can always choose a tracker.  Then you have Investment Trusts which are meant to add alpha.  However, many people think "all funds are rubbish."

2027 2018-11-03 10:56:08 Thanks Mark, I am very interested in Lord Lee’s strategy where he holds for long periods of time and buys dividend growing stocks with low P/E ratios but I have yet to come across what he defines as low. I like your approach of predicting P/E over time.
2028 2018-11-03 10:56:00 The total portfolio now contains of 18,4% cash and 81,6% stocks. The share part is 52,7% G5 entertainment, 24,5% SOBI and 22,8% CTM. Going to buy one more stock this next week, alternatively save it for CTMs Q3 and buy more there.
2029 2018-11-03 10:55:28 In my class today, I asked my participants how to make money investing? answer: buy low, sell high. Some student laugh, who don't know? but, what does it really means? Sell high = choose a stock that can go up. Buy low = chose the right price to go in. #simplestocktrade #stocks

2046 2018-11-03 10:27:10 Investment trusts + etf trackers + a few quality stocks is the way to go IMO
2047 2018-11-03 10:26:14 Let’s be even more direct. Stocks are valued based on discounting the likelihood of future performance to the present. If the market doesn’t trust what a management says, then it adopts a “wait and see” attitude. So when news is announced with big future cash implications....(a)

2055 2018-11-03 10:09:41 This makes a lot of sense to me.  Have funds and stocks.  Funds help you diversify and buy overseas stocks.  However, many people seem to only one to have one or the other.  There is often an aversion to funds.  But you can always buy low cost passive trackers.

2071 2018-11-03 09:41:22 It's a good strategy actually to boost returns. As you likely know, used in retirement planning as well. Cut risk then introduce risk, an equity glide path. @WadePfau did a lot of research on this. I de-risked in 2012 or so, then all income and new contributions went to stocks.

2267 2018-11-03 04:59:50 One major, major problem. Wall street hierarchy trashing the markets from and by whatever reason or source has people (IRAs/investments) pissed. This needs to be addressed and corrected, feels like fraud. Market "taking a pause", down 15-50% for many, many stocks, doesn't cut it
2268 2018-11-03 04:59:44 Do you use dried chiles at all in your broths/stocks? I almost always do, but I realize that falls outside classic methods.
2269 2018-11-03 04:52:12 thought not having melee singles this week was kinda a bummer, but RR crews was so lit tho. took 6 stocks, 5 stocks, and then 13 stocks. 

why is melee like fun?
2270 2018-11-03 04:51:28 Interesting, I generally only use ginger when making pork stocks, which I generally use for vaguely East Asian noodle soups.
2271 2018-11-03 04:50:09 I’ve never made any money in mine so I’d recommend stocks.

2277 2018-11-03 04:45:36 Stocks closing lower though off worst levels. Dow -140 points after being +200 early in the session.
2278 2018-11-03 04:45:14 Thanks, a lot of advocates of the philosophy that those working in the markets shouldn't own stocks at all. 

It adds up leverage at personal level as ones livelihood is dependent on the markets. 

You subscribe to that idea?

Ok, trying not to turn this into an interview. :-)
2279 2018-11-03 04:43:48 We appreciate your interest for Bullets wireless. The last sale for OnePlus Bullets wireless was on 25th October. Due to huge demand the Bullets wireless is out of stock again. We are constantly working towards bringing more and more stocks for our users.
2280 2018-11-03 04:43:45 Maybe its the right fighting in court to remove protections for preexisting conditions, gutting Medicare/social security to pay for tax cuts for the rich, Trump fueled division or the daily fear mongering that you morons fall for. Glad your stocks are doing well though.
2281 2018-11-03 04:43:01 I hate to admit this, but I’ve been making my own broths and stocks for at least 5 years now, and I can’t produce a good clear broth, much less a consume.

2283 2018-11-03 04:41:23 Very good but only one suggestion. If u r exiting before SL, by the time we see, stocks moving down.. overall excellent..
2284 2018-11-03 04:40:45 Schwab, Vanguard both have them. You put your money or stocks into the fund (and take the deduction then). Then, at any time, you can "advise" the fund to donate to a charity of your choice, which they will do... as the fund, not you.

2287 2018-11-03 04:32:42 tTrump tax scam is just more of the same old tires, trickle down economics where corporations get billions of $ in tax cuts, promise growth but instead buy back stocks and leave American middle class to fight over the crumbs, well done, Trump and GOP really showed us.
2288 2018-11-03 04:30:57 Well, either that or be locked in the stocks for a few months.
2289 2018-11-03 04:30:40 Investors don't like what's happening. Way to much debt.Stocks reflect it.
2290 2018-11-03 04:30:03 Was your buy on the 1st or 2nd Green Day? I know you like to trade first Green Day’s. Just curious.
2291 2018-11-03 04:26:16 Don't trust the numbers,
Just might be a set up, ordered by trump to inflate stats to make his party look good. Why
did stocks FALL ,shortly after
announcement of job data ?

2298 2018-11-03 04:16:45 I suffered under Obama’s punishing Obamacare “tax”. He had crap to do with my managed portfolio except tank my stocks, which finally recovered under Trump. I’m guessing you’re a young pup?
2299 2018-11-03 04:15:54 Then why does the #NRA oppose a national gun owner registry or database? Why do they only support republican candidates? Why does the NRA spread lies saying Dems want to take away everyones guns, when they know it's not true? Why do they oppose making bump stocks illegal?
2300 2018-11-03 04:15:40 They also care about enforcing a certain POV. Imagine if Bernie were president with those stock market drops. He'd have been drawn and quartered. But no repercussions for Trump. If they really cared about sensationalism they'd be screaming at Trump for the stocks drops.
2301 2018-11-03 04:15:23 Every person should own a gun. For the same situations you are mentioning. A shooter deters when there’s resistance Only way to regulate the gun issue is to have more in depth backgrounds done. Trying to restrict certain guns is only going to increase stocks in the black market.

2304 2018-11-03 04:12:34 2/n..had moved up 3x in the past twelve months.
The stocks are HEG, VENKY, GOA CARBON, GRAPHITE & SHAKTI PUMPS.
The starting capital was 10 lakhs to begin with & only long trades were taken as per my long term trend following system as & when the signal was generated.
2305 2018-11-03 04:11:04 @SubhadipNandy 
Arun have done an interesting back testing on risking less than 1% per trade to further clear your doubts about the same.
As you are aware i buy strength & sell weakness. 
The following stocks were the strongest in 2017, the base being that they 1/n..

2308 2018-11-03 04:04:24 It was already moving, ever since Obama revived it. It’s still doing well but it’s foolish to talk about a big “turnaround” under trump. Growth in both stocks & jobs, on average, was stronger under Obama. 

Plus, Obama didn’t suggest shooting at women & kids for throwing rocks.
2309 2018-11-03 04:04:05 denying for any return & refund. Now I am feeling cheated by Flipkart & felt that Flipkart clear the faulty product stocks with attractive offers. FEELING CHEATED  FLIPKART MUST COLLECT FAULTY PRODUCT & REFUND ENTIRE AMOUNT IMMEDIATELY

How do i earn 7%? Do i go into ebay flipping? Stocks? Which Stocks? how do i even BUY stocks? How do I sell them?
2311 2018-11-03 04:03:51 Yeah it's all about Power right 'Ted'?  Done anything for single moms, kids, the elederly, any legislation on immigration, healthcare, bump stocks?  Just that one tax scam that's draining the wealth of the country?

2316 2018-11-03 03:56:32 No stocks aren’t out of the woods but what’s with the drop in the USD this week? Yes I know the rubbish that’s rolled out but is there anything of substance behind it or is it just a pause on its continued push up?
2317 2018-11-03 03:53:47 Mr. President, MAGA is just a slogan. GM just announced buyouts (modern term for lay-off) for 18K salaried workers. Stocks of our Legendary American Automakers is at 8 years low, while Foreign automakers are thriving. MAGA is becoming more like making Foreign Countries Great.
2318 2018-11-03 03:53:44 Cheers will take a look, what do you think of taking short positions on oil/gas stocks like STO/WPL? 
Trump loosening sanctions, crude oil dropping and Aus gov talking about imposing more taxes over the years
2319 2018-11-03 03:53:19 Trump doesn’t care!! He is just happy to become the fascist dictator he always wanted to be. When the recession occurs he and his top1% will be ecstatic to buy up all the cheaper stocks furthering income inequality where there will be no middle class anymore.

2328 2018-11-03 03:46:14 Cut your losses. Don't hold in hopes of recovery. Chances are the trade is not in your favor, so think of it as a "no hope" situation. Your stop loss is the level you planned to exit your trade based on technicals. That level should be a point that invalidates your bias. #stocks

2332 2018-11-03 03:42:40 You must not read it. They offer granular as opposed to an overall approach to economics like WSJ. WSJ is good for an overall view of a stock, but not behind the metrics of stocks and economies. They let a child die, why not hawking?
2333 2018-11-03 03:41:33 It should. It would be...revolutionary. But it does not have to be violent. Think of the government(or even labor unions) slowly purchasing stocks until they had a controlling interest. The rich could still have money - but they would not wield control over industry.

2379 2018-11-03 02:52:45 Funny how this stock drop  looks great to those who know how to take advantage of it and have capital aside.  Can short or buy low some good stocks for good opportunity! Or sell small bounces.

2385 2018-11-03 02:44:32 Massive bull run in the bond market. When yields go down it means they made capital gains. When they start losing those gains, they sell. When they sell, interest rates go higher and start to become more attractive than stocks.

2397 2018-11-03 02:35:25 @GregBro63987876  is this a bandaid or long term solution? You always say “look at the stocks over the years.” Well this is a short term fix and a few wins... What is the longevity..

2405 2018-11-03 02:23:08 Could you add to your video if you are scaling in/out and at what points. That may help a lot of traders.
2406 2018-11-03 02:22:44 His tariffs are causing inflation which causes the Fed to raise interest rates which causes stocks to fall.  Trump is an economic no-nothing.

2408 2018-11-03 02:19:38 Using autism as an insult makes me doubt you actually have it.  Can go both ways sweetie. This will go in circles. Point is your "success" in stocks is mislead and has nothing to do with our failure of a potus.

2447 2018-11-03 01:46:56 I have traded stocks using this pattern.  The issue I see using options is consolidations can last longer than expected.  Have you found any indicators to help you manage the time factor.  I have only traded on daily so never looked at 15 30 or 60 min.
2448 2018-11-03 01:46:29 Could be. Right now looking like what happened to rare earth stocks. But I don't think so. Stocks are disconnected with crypto, would make you think crypto keeps going down when it doesn't. It's quite stable at higher prices.
2449 2018-11-03 01:46:21 I personally haven’t used it yet, but I’ve been reading into it and I’ve read it’s really good compared to others like stash and etc but your basically sol, they don’t really teach you about the different stocks and risk factors
2450 2018-11-03 01:45:49 MMT describes the stocks and flows of a monetary system ... it is totally relevant.

You spend so only a small portion of the population makes the money then wonder why inflation is low ?

2487 2018-11-03 01:00:24 QE 1, 2, hurt middle and working poor Americans the most. Cheap dollars drove up the price of goods, services. No jobs or wage increases. 1 percenters made money in stocks. That is @BarackObama legacy.
2488 2018-11-03 01:00:20 Yeah, agreed. If that money is actually going into what’s next, which was kind of my point at the beginning. Periodically, we reach these inflection points (I remember a similar discussion over sports and stocks), and there’s a sort of “How can this be!” moment…

2497 2018-11-03 00:54:20 Based on these latest wage & corporate profit reports, I would be very worried about any stocks I currently own. The market will soon feel the pinch. With living costs rising and wages not increasing enough, people will start spending less, and profits will go down. Stocks too
2498 2018-11-03 00:53:59 Yep thats trading you are on your journey it takes time
2499 2018-11-03 00:53:15 And somehow that bothers me less than pornstar payoffs, soundproof booths, buying and selling stocks after tip offs from lobbyists, flying bunny rabbits on airplanes.......The swamp, you get it, right?
2500 2018-11-03 00:50:29 Ok do your percent. If you have 5$ and someone gives you 5$ you doubled it. Very good but if you have 50 and get 40 not double but better for stocks 401k. Much harder to double bigger#s hence stock market. Sorry but this 2 year period best in history

2511 2018-11-03 00:33:52 This was exactly my question. If you have that much money outside of stocks, then you're losing lots of money to interest.
2512 2018-11-03 00:33:04 Sure.

8 years of Obama and magically when Trump is elected, stocks go up, jobs come back, life gets better.

2525 2018-11-03 00:24:06 "When we talk about universal background checks or bump stocks, we ignore the real issues. We have serious cultural issues. Mass shooting weren't happening 30 years ago. We need to talk about mental health and family breakdown."

2526 2018-11-03 00:23:46 I used to always check crypto prices throughout the weekend. Now, I don't care. Bullish. Getting ready to massively trade washed out crypto stocks from the long side.
2527 2018-11-03 00:22:09 WWE stock prices fluctuate on a cycle of 14 days. By your logic Impact and NJPW should be worried as there stock prices are expected to drop in a few days. 

A majority of all publicly traded companies see stocks dip on the cusp of the upcoming elections on Nov 6th.
2528 2018-11-03 00:21:02 I hope this goes Virale.  As a Democrat if we take the house look for Pelosi to head it, Grid Lock for two yrs, 401K down, Jobs loss, Socialism, stocks down, taxes up, Open Borders, Restrictions taken back, Health care higher,  So vote for my party  # Truth
2529 2018-11-03 00:20:56 Slow sell if the stock market, make a shit load of money with cyrpto quickly.   Then buy back into stocks
2530 2018-11-03 00:17:28 That’s exactly what it will be. Even the big news days will have a muted effect on my overall situation. Buffering the weed stocks with some big bank/insurance company stocks. Heavier pctg of weed in the TFSA account to allow slightly more aggressive gains (tax free!)
2531 2018-11-03 00:17:04 Don't think I did, actually - that's sweet of you, but if I was going to go for a lesson on stocks, I don't  think I'd go with someone with a Twitter handle reading 'The Intelligent Wrestling Fan'

2534 2018-11-03 00:15:33 It takes a while to recover from all the things that our country has endured in the past few years.  Take a look at our Stocks to show that there has been a growth since President Trump was elected.
2535 2018-11-03 00:15:30 Have a look these #stocks that made all-time highs: $CME
2536 2018-11-03 00:15:15 Don't let Trump Voters tell you about the beautiful economy he has brought us. Everyone knows the gains are the fruits of Obama’s Recovery and Reinvestment.
Now, the omens are bad. Paying farmers to offset tariffs. Oct. Worst month for US Stocks in 7 years.
2537 2018-11-03 00:15:04 If Democrats win any control economy will tank again it always does. So is it better to sell stocks on Monday or wait for Election Day and watch Soros and others short stock market?
2538 2018-11-03 00:15:01 Don't LOL. Those guys are vicious. A friend who was an analyst on Wall Street has been building a website to predict stocks and is ready to roll it out. Algorithms are the new mantra. We'll see. Generally better to under promise and over deliver, though. Honestly good luck  :)

2541 2018-11-03 00:10:39 The antisemitic scum at @Unilever presents another shitty piece of political ice cream.
I know why I got rid of my @unilever stocks and their products long time ago.
2542 2018-11-03 00:10:34 Despite Oct. being a bad month for stocks, 10 year T-note didn't see any gain for the month either.

2548 2018-11-03 00:05:06 They do, but they care more about the investors and their stocks.  They care more about short term large gains than the continuous support of their fans for decades more.  This is what it comes to with the Activision take over I suppose.  Might as well be Battlefront 3...
2549 2018-11-03 00:03:37 PREDICTION 2019: SNAP will go the way of VINE soon…the stocks are in the gutter and all it is now for folks is a camera filter…Never like it…or understood it's purpose…Good Job Instagram!

2558 2018-11-02 23:53:09 I haven't messed around with buying stocks, but as soon as someone opens up a place called "OOVOO JAVER" I'm investing.
2559 2018-11-02 23:52:44 That’s a fallacy. The incentive is to make money, ie capitalism. Just like outsourcing jobs and skirting tax laws and proppingbup stocks, the goal is $$$ the cheapest way you can make it. Lazy? Non-innovative? I wouldn’t use those words to describe the Chinese.

2563 2018-11-02 23:47:05 I think anyone that's been paying attention to the market over the past 12 months saw this coming. I find it interesting that foreign stocks such as brazillian utility companies saw gains while US stocks were being sold.

2565 2018-11-02 23:45:15 @hardball  This economy got better after Obama saved it and set it on this trajectory! Tax gifts to the 1% of 1% did nothing! They simply bought their stocks back with public money.

2588 2018-11-02 23:40:20 You know there stocks are about to become a recreation of mount Wario from MK8
2589 2018-11-02 23:39:57 2) par 3 pompiers au lieu de 4, voire 2 si population décimée... On ne oeut oas lui reprocher d'avoir peis un max de précautions.
Le vrai scandale, ce sont les stocks de "tamiflu" soit disant antiviral, inutile, commercialisé par le conseiller de Bush qui a déclenché la guerre...
2590 2018-11-02 23:38:12 Bet you stocks in Colgate have dropped heavily since Trump's been in office!
2591 2018-11-02 23:36:52 Disagree on one thing... Stocks sell off on news if that news is priced in... Not all stocks have news priced in going into binary events.  So not all stocks will sell off on good news.
2592 2018-11-02 23:35:28 Worked for nfl too. Lol. Keep up the work of self mutilation and business destruction. Look at twitter, took political stance and stocks drop 34% from 3 months ago. Lol. Will you idiots learn? That most of the country does not follow your bullshit tactics.
2593 2018-11-02 23:34:25 This is a little bit misleading. Utility tokens purely for payments are relatively pointless. If they are used for governance, they might serve a valuable purpose, just like stocks do.
2594 2018-11-02 23:34:12 I agree with you there, I'm not a trader either.  I hold names long term. Dude if $LPTX goes to $20 someday I'll be the first to congratulate you.. just don't get people on Twittr making calls on other stocks all the time as if they have a clue, nobody does... Don't care how well
2595 2018-11-02 23:34:07 How about that ban on bump stocks??  What happened to that?
2596 2018-11-02 23:33:36 Probably her man sells fairly used lingerie. Its part of the old stocks he want to suply
2597 2018-11-02 23:32:53 You can literally convert your 401k into weed (stocks) now and do so legally.  Makes me want to get a WEED THE NORTH shirt if that kind of thing existed.
2598 2018-11-02 23:32:33 Buy weed stocks with that money and u will make prolly 5x in a years time. And or buy ZRX the potentials of making 10 times the money is high!!
2599 2018-11-02 23:30:51 Why vote GOP?  Stocks are now the same before the "tax cut".  Go blue.
2600 2018-11-02 23:30:45 He also stocks a huge range of chocolates from around the world. But missed here is the subtle anti-racism & inclusion agenda of this insta acct. its a great shop!
2601 2018-11-02 23:30:25 I believe ppl especially us youngins should read & learn as much as they can on investing , stocks, bonds, etc. so when we sleeping we making money. Something school will never teach us
2602 2018-11-02 23:28:08 Have you looked at stocks this month
2603 2018-11-02 23:26:44 Ah Thanks Alexandro, Appreciate that, those are some good folks you mentioned > 
2604 2018-11-02 23:26:34 Cannabis $$$$$$$$$ coming to Uranium investment??? Cannabis stocks are done!  U stocks ready to take off as well.....I hope so.
2605 2018-11-02 23:23:54 So with that track record don't make calls on other stocks when you have no clue man, cause you sure would look foolish if $oncs isn't sell the news and the stock does well
2606 2018-11-02 23:23:48 Thank you for responding. Only OTCs or also listed stocks?
2607 2018-11-02 23:22:41 With that reduction, will the USDA lower US exports half that, 150 mb, increasing US 2018/2019 carryover stocks to over 1 bb? They should, but won’t.
2608 2018-11-02 23:22:26 Sure I can. That's why I hold both Wendys and McDonalds stocks. I believe in hamburgers. Just like I believe in bitcoin.
2609 2018-11-02 23:22:21 With that reduction, will the USDA lower US exports half that, 150 mb, increasing US 2018/2019 carryover stocks to over 1 bb? They should, but won’t.

2624 2018-11-02 23:10:05 Good thing you get to hold stocks long and now buy more Apple cheap(er) if you want.
2625 2018-11-02 23:08:40 If rocks are like rifles, why do we need bump stocks?
2626 2018-11-02 23:08:19 U.S. stocks closes mostly lower Friday,11/01/18: $DJIA -0.43% at 25,270.83, $SPX -0.63% at 2,723.06, $COMPQ -1.04% at 7,356.99, $RUT +0.19% at $1547.98.
2627 2018-11-02 23:08:03 So surely, when your system is telling you to buy, sell. When its telling you to sell, buy. Right? 

Try that see the results. Maybe your system just need inverting.
2628 2018-11-02 23:07:23 @ZeeBusiness @AnilSinghviZEE @subhashchandra My humble request to Zeebusiness channel, please stop inviting DD sharma as an expert in stocks recommendations, most of his recommendations in last 2 years are down by 80%. He is fraud and made money from these companies. Please save

2633 2018-11-02 23:04:45 Guys I’m just reminiscing on how much I love compartment models and the elegance of partial differential equations to describe flows between stocks. You can do hawt science basically by inventing your graphic-less own video game. #FridayFeeling
2634 2018-11-02 23:04:22 Looks like stocks to trade
2635 2018-11-02 23:03:45 You probably invested in crappy stocks.
2636 2018-11-02 23:03:11 @TheBull_Stocks because his DD is on point
@br4nd1e because she post only what she believes will be a great return
@ShortSqueezed1 great stock picks, usually 100%+ return
@KentsBrokerage because he's bull and bear
@SaraGoingUp great OTC trader
2637 2018-11-02 23:02:36 Someone doesn't seem the realise that while WWE has done some crappy things, they have always been obvious as storyline. WWE also cares about money. If it came out this is storyline, stocks and ratings would crash. Saudi Arabia might even back out.

2642 2018-11-02 22:58:54 But that’s in his portfolio to buy stocks or bonds on dips, not for spending. It’s not really liquid
2643 2018-11-02 22:58:48 Closing of US stocks not a good signature
Yes weekly charts have bullish hammer. 
The technology, semi, FANG, & China internet not so good. Most have bearish cloud cover
Perhaps the most important break (Gap) is Apple the gap holds the key for markets in coming weeks and months.

2653 2018-11-02 22:52:54 Hooray! So pleased to see the return of Kiwi. Maybe you won't see so much of him during the colder months now, he'll just potter out to that lovely squirrel Waitrose that you've set up for him and then spend a few days in his drey, munching away till stocks run low again. 
2654 2018-11-02 22:51:33 @Jesse_W33 I enjoy your ideas, you know your stuff. Who did you follow to learn from? Looking for a trader to follow and learn from who trades cheap stocks, doesn't pump, and knows his stuff #stocks #Crypto
2655 2018-11-02 22:51:19 Thanks for your reply. Is 'Green Citrus Slim' going out of production? Hardly anywhere in Vancouver stocks in now. :-(
2656 2018-11-02 22:49:45 Hi there, I've managed to find the Highland Spring product but not the Princes Gate bottles. could you please DM your nearest local store and I can check their stocks against our records? Many thanks - Noor
2657 2018-11-02 22:49:22 One thing you leftist-socialist do good is whine, belly ache and bash in a mob fashion. I haven’t heard one of you complain about more $ in your pay check or your bull market stocks going through the roof or more women than ever in supervisory positions or the lowest unemployment

2659 2018-11-02 22:48:01 Brilliant book by @bethanymac12 #SaudiAmerica , great ROI if you read the book after the release and sold your shale stocks.

2661 2018-11-02 22:46:00 Oui mais les stocks seront vite épuisés du coup faut etre actif
2662 2018-11-02 22:45:29 Yes it's very possible, I believe that.  I had to lose money for nearly 10 years, blow up an account of 10,000, before I learned how to make money and trade.  Valuable lesson.  

For someone just starting trading, if you start playing with penny stocks and shcoins,expect the same
2663 2018-11-02 22:45:25 Even when I'm wealthy and have invested in property and stocks, I'll still be shopping at the Dollar Tree and 99 Cent store for some things I need lol

2667 2018-11-02 22:43:49 I see stuff like this all the time , especially "promoted " tweets . that's why bighit stocks is rising and everyone else is falling. Ads ,media play  cost $
2668 2018-11-02 22:43:49 A reporter would still get in trouble if they traded stocks based on that info! (THAT'S still insider trading, if they got it from an insider!) But not if they published it.

2680 2018-11-02 22:34:12 Stocks closing lower though off worst levels. Dow -140 points after being +200 early in the session.
2681 2018-11-02 22:34:08 Stocks cut some losses after President Trump says trade deal with China is closer.
2682 2018-11-02 22:34:07 They could ban assault style weapons, bump stocks, tighten up loopholes for background checks, deny firearms to domestic violence offenders.
2683 2018-11-02 22:34:03 President Trump's top economic advisor, Larry Kudlow says, "There's no massive movement to deal with China." Stocks fell on the headlines.

2691 2018-11-02 22:23:31 it seems to me that the narrative changes from week to week depending on what is going on, so the oil related stocks look like good candidates for swing trades... $wti had a great q3, so did $xom and $bp

2694 2018-11-02 22:20:49 Trump is pro gun control while lying to his cult base that he isn't. He has always been for heavy gun control and has proposed six gun control measures while being in office. He has implemented one and the ban on bump stocks is next.
2695 2018-11-02 22:20:32 30. Single family rentals and 401k in index funds; some individual stocks and mutual funds mixed in that I’m gradually selling. Engineer and financial analyst. Avg annual gross combined the last 3 years: $190k
2696 2018-11-02 22:20:19 One reason why Canada was judged as a dark time during WWII because the economy and stock markets were down due to massive debt to the investors borrowing massive amounts of money from selling the stocks.
2697 2018-11-02 22:19:59 Sometimes I really think some VCs take conversations of founders and short some major corporations stocks when it's insanely high when they shouldn't be.... For example: $ALGN was almost at 400 a month ago. It's at 228 now...

2704 2018-11-02 22:15:40 Stocks fell on another volatile day Friday as hopes for a US-China trade deal and a solid jobs report initially pushed the Dow higher but weren't enough to offset concerns about a lackluster holiday outlook. Doing Great Donny!!!

2710 2018-11-02 22:07:51 @FoxNews #SpecialReport isn't it funny/weird how stocks are/go down with good job numbers and low unemployment? Btw, of course China wants to make a deal, they've lost at least 5-6 trillion dollars due to tariffs compared to our $2 trillion. They need us more than we need them.
2711 2018-11-02 22:06:02 I agree. I just think it's a little tone-deaf to be touting how great the economy is when really, only people who own stocks or real-estate are seeing any meaningful gains. We should focus on wages, housing, healthcare, and education if we're gonna talk economics before midterms.
2712 2018-11-02 22:05:29 You sure about those stocks now? 
I'm so glad you're doing well. Most are not.

Man who says rocks are the same as firearms still hasn’t prohibited bump stocks 1 year after the worst mass shooting in modern US history. 
Give me an example of a time when someone used rocks to kill 58 people & injure 500 in 10 minutes or less.

Investors, even tech savvy ones, might be waiting for others to “go first”. Or might just be scared off by the smoke.

2725 2018-11-02 21:51:27 Stocks opened up, sold off, then stabilized near the close. TREND STILL DOWN, FULL HEDGES in place.

2730 2018-11-02 21:45:03 Tough call since in a clear uptrend I've been burned since L2 it's like showing your hand and get taken out early. But of course in recent down trend a must. I'd say in highly volatile pot stocks using them less in uptrends. We'll see.

2732 2018-11-02 21:44:55 From my Charles Schwab account: "Stocks continue to be pressured by concerns about tighter monetary policy, the impact of tariffs, and mixed earnings reports from companies for the third quarter. 
Despite these recent events, it's important to maintain a long-term perspective..."
2733 2018-11-02 21:43:57 So when BAWs actually buy growth stocks, those stocks stop growing.   :)
2734 2018-11-02 21:43:40 apple stocks rise by 69%.
2735 2018-11-02 21:43:35 The wealthiest 10% of income earners own 80% of stocks while the bottom 50% of income earners own practically none. Obama is a truly great person, but the stock market rally that began under his tenure hasn't helped most of us. We all may have jobs, but those jobs are inadequate.

2739 2018-11-02 21:37:55 I’d like some solid proof that the economy is doing better, other than “stocks are up,” because honestly everyone except shareholders could give less of a shit about the stock market; it only affects us when it crashes and those companies are bailed out using our tax dollars
2740 2018-11-02 21:36:43 Rent too damn high!!! Real estate too damn high!!!  Stocks too damn high!!!  Food too damn high!!! Don't really understand the point of destroying capitalism with endless ponzis from Bernanke/ Yellen.  Starving the country?

2753 2018-11-02 21:32:48 NO! But they should care about overpriced, artificially inflated Stocks!

2755 2018-11-02 21:32:28 I recommend salesforce to those retreating from other stocks, it's practically free money at this point, it should be touching the 200s in a sane economy
2756 2018-11-02 21:32:06 Despite good job reports, stocks are down today. Tariffs are the major concern for Wall St.. Investors has no clue what's going on with tariffs & they claim, there is no definitive decision by #TRUMP & keep changing the story on tariffs specially with China. Wall St. Uncertain.
2757 2018-11-02 21:31:49 @solomonster WWE stocks has dropped almost $2, currently at around $1.75 loss and it's continuing to drop
2758 2018-11-02 21:30:36 As a bull market continues, almost anything you buy goes up. It makes you feel that investing in stocks is a very easy and safe and that you’re a financial genius.

2760 2018-11-02 21:30:02 I'm thinking it will still happen, but next year. Will still be in stocks and sports cars as well, but I think there will be a deal go down with this series. The $$ was right, so if the ride is competitive and the offer is still on the table, I'll take it.
2761 2018-11-02 21:29:15 The stocks have been terrible for Apple
2762 2018-11-02 21:27:24 When Trump is gone all these outlets are toast. Short this shit out of big media stocks.
2763 2018-11-02 21:26:29 Really like your strategy here mate with the starting at 3.5k. So you trade rather than try to hold anything long term? I’m doing some research around #LPA at the moment. One of the most unknown stocks. Will contact co on Mon, to get more info
2764 2018-11-02 21:26:22 @CNN @MSNBC @AP Despite good job report Stocks are down today? Seems Wall Street more concerned about not just rising interest rates but according some economists at CNBC Tariffs are the major worry for investors, some are shorting the stocks.
2765 2018-11-02 21:26:04 More bullish news on stocks.. CNBC reports hedge fund bodies floating to the top.. as Fusion said,  Type 2 correction punishes momos even long/short strategies...
2766 2018-11-02 21:25:24 Wait whaaaaat? This morning all you media types were telling us that stocks were rallying on the jobs report. Now you tell  us that they sold off on the jobs report. Why didn't you warn us?

2769 2018-11-02 21:22:11 That sucks about the retirement account. U should adjust ur shares to better-performing stocks. Student loans r a money pit. Sorry u got one. I never had one. If I didn't have the $, I just didn't register. Took 2 classes at a time so it was affordable. Dad told me 2 avoid them.
2770 2018-11-02 21:22:05 Got a link to that law? I'd have been fine with us joining before ... stronger stable currency c.f. super-volatile £ (good news for speculators like Odey who funded brexshit - he's got £100s millions hedged against £ and UK stocks, ready for hard-brexshit impact).

2774 2018-11-02 21:15:24 Donald Trump has made absolute fool's of the American media , and he enjoys doing it every day !

2775 2018-11-02 21:14:56 Cutting taxes, removing regulations, putting workers 1st, securing our borders, renegotiating bad trade deals, leaving Paris Accord, record low minority unemployment, expanding GDP growth, record optimism, greater wages & opportunity, record stocks, manufacturing up, judges, etc.
2776 2018-11-02 21:14:12 No problem Sir. My pleasure. Always good to do your own research to see if these fit with your investment goals. Expect a good deal of volatility on all of these stocks and yes this IS a long game. A little longer to wait yet but all the pieces are falling into place.
2777 2018-11-02 21:14:06 @cnnbrk @InpixonHQ Hey CNN instead of pushing your agendas let’s talk about Ali Nadir and Inpixon.  3 Reverse Splits in 2 years, how does the SEC allow companies like this to dilute there own stocks with Financial Institutions like John Fife Chicago Venture and Sabby and others.
2778 2018-11-02 21:13:33 ‘Fiscal stimulus’ = printing money & dumping it into stocks (and a bunch of fake, corrupt “jobs” programs).

Trump cut regulation, taxes, and unfavorable trade agreements. That’s actual, healthy stimulus resulting in massive job growth & wage growth as workers become scarce.

2783 2018-11-02 21:10:01 There is actually a thing called paid bashers.  I know I am still ignorant to stocks yet I didn't know that.
2784 2018-11-02 21:09:33 @elonmusk @pewdiepie . Host meme review with Felix and your stocks will increase tenfold. Or better hire him after he retires from youtube. That would be epic.
2785 2018-11-02 21:09:16 yes China is throwing everything at stabling the economy plunge protection team is buying stocks, state banks are providing credit to small and medium business. interbank rates have been falling for some time now stimulas take a while to work through
2786 2018-11-02 21:08:54 It all depends. In backtesting, I find that waiting for stocks to cross 200 SMA comes at the cost of giving up some gains for stocks that do eventually recover.
2787 2018-11-02 21:07:57 Even those are just some gullible people who want to clear short expiry stocks.
2788 2018-11-02 21:05:47 Market Close: MBS -55bps; DOW -109.91; NASDAQ -77.06; S&P 500 -17.31; 10yr Treasury 3.22%.  Stocks closed in the Red after WH Official dismisses any report of US/China Trade Agreement completed any time soon; and MBS freefell throughout the day on worries of inflation.

2790 2018-11-02 21:04:49 A lot of the people I enjoyed following are no longer with us. Thanks to Twitter. What a great future we have when even the arbiters of free speech wantonly suppress it for nothing more than a higher grading of stocks and shares. Who new! Rhetorically speaking.
2791 2018-11-02 21:03:53 Nigga I bet on games everyday. I would rather fuck with them stocks than that shit lol
2792 2018-11-02 21:03:18 The Boeing Company (BA) price at close, 2018-11-02, is 358.88. #boeing #stocks #NYSE #space
2793 2018-11-02 21:02:00 Actually, I wish I was paid as a basher.  I don't really know that much as into stocks.  Well, as they always say never assume or base things off impression.  At times you can get the wrong impression and end up being wrong.  If I was paid I wouldn't need to work law enforcement.

@InVodkaWeTrust
2810 2018-11-02 20:49:08 Correct stocks rise and fall but the country is on a better footing now to handle anything that may come its way. The constitutionalist judicial appointments, the demand for respect among other nations, the ending of nuclear testing in NK, and these trade deals all factor in.
2811 2018-11-02 20:48:06 The economy is too good to pass up. Why would the groups that bankrolled Hillary & lost want to double down and walk back jobs, biz growth and stocks? Top 5% could. But they're just that, 5%.
2812 2018-11-02 20:48:01 Had the best trading week in a couple years. Bottom picked industrial stocks on the bs fear and rode em back up like a champ.

2814 2018-11-02 20:46:13 Bastards put their stocks over ppls health!
2815 2018-11-02 20:46:12 They are all like the guy in the beer ad that who winds up in the stocks:  King: "Bar keep Bud Lights for everyone."  Patron:  "Actually, I would prefer a nice mead."
2816 2018-11-02 20:45:30 The recovery that started during Obama tenure is continuing up to this point, now the stock market is retreating, tax cuts, inflation, prices, stagnant wages and budget deficit didn’t help to stop people, only the upper 0.1 % and big corporations who used it to buyback stocks!
2817 2018-11-02 20:44:55 - Caved to China's ZTE, despite national security threat
- Think that all Nigerians live in huts in sh*thole countries
- Failed to ban bump stocks
- Opened parks, rivers and shores to drilling and pollution
- Support trophy hunting and killing hibernating bears
2818 2018-11-02 20:44:44 Sorry no analysis for you today. Trading chop & reversals in downtrends is tricky. I'll leave you to your own devices. Still trading miners, shippers, gold, silver, selected stocks. Keeping position sizes small & risk tight.
2819 2018-11-02 20:44:22 FANG stocks contributed 20% (2.1ppt) to YTD total returns through Sept, but were an 18% (1.2ppt) detractor from Oct. returns: BofA

2825 2018-11-02 20:38:55 In the middle of a trade war they thought China would give an inch lol. Trump and his State Department are making themselves laughing stocks lol.
2826 2018-11-02 20:37:50 Sorry 44, giving up economy, biz, & stocks as they are is not worth the risk.

2829 2018-11-02 20:37:19 i picked random at a smash tourney in a bar and took 2 stocks even tho i hadnt played in months im the fucking machine
2830 2018-11-02 20:37:14 it's beautiful to see that the massive head & shoulders top in the German $DAX is exactly the 161.8% extension of the 2000-2013 consolidation (~11,800). If we're below it, I can't be bullish stocks with a straight face $SPY $DJIA $EUFN $EWG
2831 2018-11-02 20:36:06 That land where you are growing fuel is itself not available for either nature or food production. Demand for biomass fuel drives global incentives for deforestation and increases the amount of arable land needed for food production. Depletion of stocks and sinks simultaneously.
2832 2018-11-02 20:35:52 That’s why we invest in solid project. Not everything will last. People on stocks are going to look for an alternative when shit starts to tank. It’s happening
2833 2018-11-02 20:35:48 @StreetMusic1234 He is openly manipulating the stocks with his stupid tweets. That’s not legal!
2834 2018-11-02 20:35:12 Nahhhh all about blue sky stocks like Versarien showing their worth with newly announced big orders and revenues!!
2835 2018-11-02 20:34:58 blimey! Don't think I had black pudding for lunch... Anyway, what excess blood stocks during war? #wikiballs
2836 2018-11-02 20:34:46 @RobinhoodApp why was my account deactivated for no reason? I cant get to my crypto or stocks. Really annoying
2837 2018-11-02 20:33:47 No matter what people say, AAPL is one of the few stocks you’ve never wavered on.  You’ve always been long-term bullish. You may have recommended buying opportunities along the way that may have been wrong in the short-term, but nobody can blame you for a loss in this stock.
2838 2018-11-02 20:33:16 The top five stocks that closed lower today were $FTNT, $KHC, $SYF, $SRCL, and $NFX.
2839 2018-11-02 20:33:07 Stocks are high, unemployment is low, and yet the majority of people are very unhappy about the country's direction.  Maybe it's not about money and greed after all?...maybe there's still some Americans left who care about something more?  I sure hope so, anyway...

2841 2018-11-02 20:32:11 The top five most active stocks today were $GE, $AMD. $AAPL, $BAC, and $F.
2842 2018-11-02 20:31:43 November 2 8:32 AM   U.S. stocks fall despite blowout jobs numbers
2843 2018-11-02 20:31:23 Oh yeah, he was 'guided by the beauty of our weapons". He probably masturbates to tomahawk missiles and lockheed stocks.
2844 2018-11-02 20:31:06 The top five stocks that closed higher today were $IRSN. $NWL, $SBUX, $ANET, and $WLTW.
2845 2018-11-02 20:30:53 OTC stocks.  Instead, brokers must obtain current information to meet certain requirements under SEC and FINRA rules to begin quoting.  Further, the lifting of a trading suspension does not mean the risks of the investment have been eliminated.
2846 2018-11-02 20:30:34 PLEASE make fs meter legal. Idk wtf else people want the smash team to do to make them legal. They're basically just specials like in any actual fighting game now. Increase the amount stocks and it's all good imo
2847 2018-11-02 20:29:50 > 3,000 stocks out there, and you're trying to short the biggest momo trade of 2018

Good.  Luck.  To.   You.
2848 2018-11-02 20:29:45 I’m sure that gap is the reason regular viewers haven’t bought back stocks just yet
2849 2018-11-02 20:29:11 Stocks represented companies, jobs are a cost to these companies also makes it more likely that the fed will continue to raise interest rates which also increase cost for these companies to borrow
2850 2018-11-02 20:28:15 I’m being tongue in cheek. Different situations. Lock stocks weren’t as good in 2014/15 as they are now. Plus Itoje was a year older then than Kpoku is now.
2851 2018-11-02 20:26:58 Silly stocks

2857 2018-11-02 20:22:20 That’s great actually, means that it’s an opportunity to buy stocks for cheap before before they blow up again!
2858 2018-11-02 20:22:20 Most people that invested in pot stocks invested out of hype. Most of them don't even look at the companies they invest in. At one point, everyone was creating an account to trade them, a couple of months back XD
2859 2018-11-02 20:21:52 Someone should be fired! Weak to put a mobile app for Diablo. Make a Mobile app huge news for wow one year and watch the stocks drop.
2860 2018-11-02 20:21:41 There's no value when no one has any idea of the financials or what is going on inside the country. Too many other value stocks to buy in developed countries with regulatory bodies overseeing their businesses.
2861 2018-11-02 20:21:08 except old hippies buying pot stocks
2862 2018-11-02 20:20:11 Late eod run on all the #MJ stocks...  very surprising!! When does farm bill come out? Are you ready for $PYX Earnings?
2863 2018-11-02 20:19:33 what in the world would he need to talk to Jack Welch about? That would be like asking you what stocks to buy.
2864 2018-11-02 20:19:29 Smaller stocks offer hope that market's rebound has legs. Russell 2000 small-stock index +0.2% Fri. while S&P 500 -0.6%.

That continues  trend: For the week Russell +4.3% vs S&P +2.4%. 

Smaller cos. tend to depend more on US (vs global) economy. Oct. US jobs report is bullish.

2877 2018-11-02 20:12:36 Yes, I am seeing the damage. Lowest unemployment ever, more jobs than people to do them, stocks at record levels, fed raising interest rates faster than ever to try and keep economy from growing so fast, minority unemployment down, minority business ownership up. It is horrible.

2885 2018-11-02 20:11:28 World stocks ex US higher: Europe +.3%; US -.6. Mixed messages on China trade talks & Apple report were enough to wipeout early rally. Again, let me say short-term trading by non-professionals is a fool’s game. Stick to a long-term plan; patience will be rewarded. Get rich slowly
2886 2018-11-02 20:11:26 8.8 billion recently removed from bond market. Guy says there is no alternative to stocks and cash on cnbc... obviously hasn’t heard much about #tron #bullish
2887 2018-11-02 20:10:45 Numbers are true. Stocks  plummeting though.
Do you just want numbers (the likes of which have been seen before in other administrations) or blind allegiance to a Dictator & Russia loving, lying, racist, divisive, criminal, hooker chasing President? A disgrace and threat to USA.

2892 2018-11-02 20:09:13 Stocks pull up from lows to end mostly but modestly lower. Hopes for US/China trade deal lured buyers in final hour.

Dow -109, -0.4% to 25,270

S&P -0.6%, Nasdaq -1.0% as Apple $AAPL (-6.6%) drags after earnings report

Bulls ruled the week: Dow +2.4%, S&P +2.4%, Nasdaq +2.6%.
2893 2018-11-02 20:09:04 Yes, mine is an online srock trading account. No capital gains taxes. No capital loss relief either though. My pot stocks bought 1 yr ago have yielded a great profit. TAX FREE! RRSP's are completely separate savings plan.
2894 2018-11-02 20:08:45 There's just an overall a lack of financial literacy to be honest. It's sad. Why you're important!!You always learn som info to pass on to clients, for example no OTC stocks in a TFSA, or howUS dividends are partially taxed in a TFSA
2895 2018-11-02 20:06:31 No, it's the shit he's done that caused my feelings towards him. The stocks are artificially inflated by the tax cuts that were supposed to trickle down was used for buybacks keeping the wealth right where they want it. Unemployment was in a steady decline for years.

2913 2018-11-02 19:58:55 Yep and that’s how we have the ever increasing wealth gap in this country. There is a reason only 54% of Americans have investments and of that 93% of stocks are owned by the top 20%. It is possible for steady market growth while investing in public services.
2914 2018-11-02 19:58:47 i don't know anything about stocks, care to explain?
2915 2018-11-02 19:58:10 No. You have to find strike price closest to 40 Delta (greeks system).

40 delta is just a little out of the money (slightly lower than the underlying stocks current price).
2916 2018-11-02 19:57:41 Minutes away from NA market casinos closing. Imho, last 4 days of trading of pot stocks = a bottom unless there is further negative news flows sector wise or company specific news or markets in general.  Have a great weekend to all followers, following and those interacting. 
2917 2018-11-02 19:57:18 Precious metals mining stocks are like Doritos -- you can't eat just one. It's not wise to put all your chips on one. Better to identify 8 - 12 good ones and spread out your risk. Also: explorers/juniors = high risk/high reward; mid-tier/major producers: less risk/less reward.
2918 2018-11-02 19:56:40 what kind of fuckin paint do they need??? just have them send you a local vendor who stocks it or something what the fuck

2920 2018-11-02 19:56:09 Decide what matters, wages vs profits. Debit vs stocks. We know
2921 2018-11-02 19:55:33 As subprime credit lenders like $COF and $CACC - they have rising charge-offs and falling provisions for bad credit. It's classic GAAP earnings manipulation.  99% of the retards who buy or analyze (e.g. the idiots on bubblevision) stocks have no idea this occurs.
2922 2018-11-02 19:51:17 We will be dumping all David Gillam promoted stocks on Monday
2923 2018-11-02 19:50:32 On October 3rd there was a massive bond sell off, where yields soared. Stocks plunged from then on. Yields are even higher today!
2924 2018-11-02 19:49:15 Vote blue is why America is so uneven in prosperity. Top 1% already owns 95% of everything real estate/business & if it wasn’t for 401K they’d own all stocks but the bottom feeders own 15% of the market thru 401k. Now what? Tax tax? We are 21.6T in debt Billions over budget ea yr
2925 2018-11-02 19:48:50 Its all about stocks, not about markets
2926 2018-11-02 19:47:34 To the average working person a 50% tax would be ridiculous. BUT most billionaires don’t actually work like the working class. They make loads of their money through stocks, investments and other means. Eg Jeff Bezos earns millions per day. He should pay his fair share.

2930 2018-11-02 19:46:28 Strafe gegen Tim Bender wegen hohen Stocks. Da war keine Strafe angezeigt, nach ungefähr drei völlig konfusen Diskussionsminuten schicken sie Bender dann doch auf die Strafbank. Seltsam. (35.) | #ERCvsNIT 2:1
2931 2018-11-02 19:46:02 That's not at all what I meant. Just that the National Interest article is a bit misleading because migrant stocks are different than migrant flows. Russia may be 2nd or 3rd in terms of absolute # of foreign-born, but was world's 7th largest immigrant destination in 2010-2015.
2932 2018-11-02 19:43:28 It's encouraging that $GGII is getting thinner on the way up. I love penny stocks when it starts to get cold outside
2933 2018-11-02 19:42:53 Being Canadian, I get asked everyday if I “invest” in pot stocks. No I don’t invest in bubbles. I can only imagine some of the money people lost chasing because of FOMO..
2934 2018-11-02 19:42:45 A mi me parece q esta apreciación es producto de la fenomenal baja de oferta de crédito e importaciones ( entre otros efectos liquidacion de stocks) y creo q se ira revirtiendo a medida que se expanda el credito a medida q vaya bajando la tasa y la inflacion .

2939 2018-11-02 19:39:08 Market action this week focused on conflicting China trade news. Rather than listen to politicians re China, one might note that many tech & bank stocks have fallen below their 8&10-month moving averages. Might be a good spot to wait until price action regains the moving averages
2940 2018-11-02 19:39:04 She's someone my dad has picked out to take over managing his investments, stocks, shares, ISA's etc. He is very knowledgeable about this & has handled them himself very successfully but my mum & I will help when he's gone so he's been vetting people.
2941 2018-11-02 19:37:57 I hope you have good stocks, your long-term, and your reinvesting dividends and compounding! Good luck!
2942 2018-11-02 19:37:16 Yes, he was in the Ministry of Food. During the War he had a mad idea to use excess stocks of human blood to make black pudding, according to Wikipedia.
2943 2018-11-02 19:37:15 So his master plan was to buy a smaller position in these stocks than any small cap ETF would have? Man, that's some real next level thinking there.

2953 2018-11-02 19:34:32 I would love to say hi on Sunday xxx
2954 2018-11-02 19:33:59 I’m so pissed at myself for not buying some Tesla stocks when I had the chance
2955 2018-11-02 19:33:26 If the corporation are buying back their stock shares that mean the demand is up and the price for them is up , so if a retirement fund owns these stocks they are valued higher. This gives the retirees more money.
2956 2018-11-02 19:33:13 What I’ve learned in stocks is when everybody think alike and apprehend same thing... more than often its total opposite
2957 2018-11-02 19:31:56 Lmfao, I got stocks but is not enough. What makes u think I'm a bloomer 
2958 2018-11-02 19:31:36 If anyone reading this is thinking about investing in stocks, now is the perfect time
2959 2018-11-02 19:31:19 You were ready to jump in bed with them but the prince back out that's why you had to prop up your stocks, hence the fine.
2960 2018-11-02 19:31:13 From +40K in pot stocks (excluding what Ive sold for profits or losses), to only up $20K b/c of the selloff that began about early morning Oct 15 to about Monday Oct 26, got back about $10K. Not too bad, now let see over next month/two/Qs, sector can regain some more momentum up.

2967 2018-11-02 19:28:02 I am beyond sick and tired. I've joined private access today and am going all in in terms of effort, study and discipline. Cannabis stocks, crypto all of it has had a massive impact on expectations v. reality.
2968 2018-11-02 19:27:52 Also note that trade war has not had much negative effect except for stocks

2972 2018-11-02 19:26:57 is tax loss selling season even going to be a thing in energy stocks when every single one has been decimated  ... we're all just going to trade our losers to each other so we don't lose exposure lol
2973 2018-11-02 19:26:28 Stocks less sour. Dow down about half a point, Nasdaq down about a point and the S&P 500 in the middle.

2974 2018-11-02 19:26:02 For 35 years, stocks have typically moved inversely to bonds. Long enough to be ingrained in investor psychology, but not long when compared to the rest of US history. 

I have a feeling there will be some surprised investors over the completion of this market cycle.
2975 2018-11-02 19:25:31 Yup. Half the country doesn’t own ANY stocks
2976 2018-11-02 19:25:03 Wow stocks cut losses by 2/3 after "happy talk" (no action) on the trade war... too funny.
2977 2018-11-02 19:24:54 start with monk.last 3 yrs ICES have recommended 40%\30%\30% increases but for some reason monk classed as Data poor stock,even tho the last 20years fishers have tryed athing to improve the science for monk,under CFP rules data poor stocks are limited to 20% quota increases

2980 2018-11-02 19:23:46 Thanks! One more quick question please. If you make small perturbations to daily returns, then the variance of 12 month returns will be larger than the ‘base’ world. Could it be that 12-1 works in a world where stocks have a certain variance but doesn’t in one with a larger var?
2981 2018-11-02 19:23:05 Three e&p buyouts this week and the stocks in the sector feel as stable as a pile of  in a wet paper bag.
2982 2018-11-02 19:22:51 do you think all stocks are gonna be tokenized
2983 2018-11-02 19:21:43 Please add the stocks that have really tanked and also the housing market and how bad it is then Tell us about what you did.
2984 2018-11-02 19:21:43 What about cost? It was a deep skim but I didn’t pick out anything that mentioned the cost of buying/selling stocks versus bonds.
2985 2018-11-02 19:21:18 You are aware there is an election on Tuesday?  "STOCKS ARE UP" has been like 30% of his rallying cry.
2986 2018-11-02 19:20:26 Jackson built that Warriors team tho and would’ve won if they would of kept him he turned them from laughing stocks of the league to back to back playoff appearances in years
2987 2018-11-02 19:20:21 Yes, #bond yields rising is not good for #stockmarket valuations. But is that all we care about in this country, where the Dow is? I sure as heck hope not. Real wage growth is needed if a recovery is helping everyone, and maybe just maybe it is finally happening. #stocks
2988 2018-11-02 19:19:59 All forecasts point to a market downturn if Dems take control of the senate next week. Be careful what you wish for (if you’ve got money riding on major stocks and indices) #markets #Midterms2018 @CNBC
2989 2018-11-02 19:19:28 I agree 100%.  I don’t want to take guns away from gun owners, but we do need gun reform! Bump stocks, a automatic rifles, why do you need these to hunt??, guns in hands of mentally challenged, thorough background checks, applying same rules to gun shows etc
2990 2018-11-02 19:19:24 Yeah YouTube. I would read first then videos in regard to stocks because there are various stocks and different ways you can trade like day trading and swing trading. Can definitely make a second income off of it an extra 1K or more a month.
2991 2018-11-02 19:19:24 The PPT better keep an eye on crude oil. They can't have it both ways for Tuesday. Cheap oil or cheap stocks. Pick one.
2992 2018-11-02 19:18:53 You could put them into medieval style stocks as that precisely how they were used... put the lawbreakers in the stocks and everyone else can throw stuff at them - e.g. rotten fruit, etc.
2993 2018-11-02 19:17:44 Yeah: buy index funds like the Total stock market- never buy stocks- and the expense ratio is zero...Can you understand that?
2994 2018-11-02 19:17:15 Ten year yields have gone back above 3.2% which is a sign inflation fears are picking up again. This will stall stocks until the market gets comfortable with how high rates will rise. As stated, I don’t think yields go above 3.4%, which would then allow stocks to resume rise
2995 2018-11-02 19:17:03 President trump's top economic advisor, Larry Kudlow says, "There's no massive movement to deal with China." Stocks fell on the headlines.
2996 2018-11-02 19:16:15 A public birching followed by an afternoon in the stocks should be the punishment for this pond life. What a fucking disgrace!
2997 2018-11-02 19:16:00 So essentially you think they are going to report a blow out quarter? So you do option trades around earnings, just not stocks
2998 2018-11-02 19:14:45 The main confusions I see in my line of work are the contribution limits, the withdrawals and when they can be contributed back as well as the type of investments you can have. You can actually buy stocks and options but gotta be careful about day trading to generate income

3003 2018-11-02 19:12:30 Stocks/investments/IRAs are in the toilet, latter probably the no. 1 monetary priority for everyone. If it's indeed a fear of the midterms going more red as suggested, should help resolve itself. If not, this fraud needs to be investigated, been going on for 5Q now, financials gd
3004 2018-11-02 19:12:15 Nope you aren’t realizing any gains.  Stocks could lose half the value tomorrow.  If that happens will you run around proclaiming that you are broke?
3005 2018-11-02 19:11:42 That youth is inherently attractive, per @yaronbrook, explains the long-term outperformance of growth stocks versus value stocks.
3006 2018-11-02 19:11:27 Im generally opposed to anything like that but the way meters work with damage and stocks + how central theyll be to killing makes it a hell no imo

3008 2018-11-02 19:11:15 $spx #stocks market fears rates and tariffs. Rate news was bad today. tariffs news mixed as Trump stated optimism but no demonstrable progress. I doubt many want to be long this weekend and expect a late day selloff below 2700 though trading sideways around 2717 level possible
3009 2018-11-02 19:08:49 Rob, are you seriously complaining about a U stock circle jerk?  You've been at the center of the uranium circle jerk for over a decade now.  If it bothers you so much, why not start naming names?  Or are you afraid it will compromise your job security (pumping U stocks)?

3011 2018-11-02 19:06:42 Monday stocks will be up. Cause Trump is gonna do promotion before midterm. My guess.
3012 2018-11-02 19:05:23 1. There is always a presidential bump to stocks. 2. There is evidence and research to show expansion of Medicare will reduce medical costs and improve the population health. In comparison to 3. Tax cuts for big business results in an increase in deficit and no trickle down
3013 2018-11-02 19:05:16 treasuries and stocks both selling off hard today. 2Y and 30Y new highs, 10Y pretty close

3016 2018-11-02 19:02:19 I agree & will be in & out of trades quicker.  Take your profits while they`re there. I also agree with you Gregory on the bullishness of stocks while we are in a Buy Back month (November). It`s time to error on the side of being long with Call options. : ]
3017 2018-11-02 19:02:07 The young can control the outcome of a close election. It's their credit card paying for our party and on the one year anniversary of the Las Vegas massacre still no action on bump stocks

3019 2018-11-02 18:59:51 This is small cap Biotech. All the gamblers play with these stocks and this always happens. I'm not surprised by this price action at all. And honestly you don't want it to go up too much too fast otherwise it puts a Target on it.
3020 2018-11-02 18:56:42 Wrong type of trade. Though trade in stocks and shares is so detached from freight and transit, from haulage ... it may be focus on the first and ignorance of the second that explains much of the UK's Brexit problems.
3021 2018-11-02 18:56:38 Bonds breaking I’d pay attention to that. Nearing new highs in yield new lows in price. Stocks trying to rally in the face of that? DXY barely moving given the rout yesterday. No correlation here. It has to catch up imo.
3022 2018-11-02 18:56:20 is "people who own stocks" a reasonable definition of the bourgeoisie in the year 2018?
3023 2018-11-02 18:55:31 We are likely looking to wipe the stock slate clean soon and ‘reset valuations’, have what they called a “re-pricing event”. 

Stocks will fall, could get very ugly as contagion fears spread globally. Those with cash can trade, might catch bounces but better to wait it out.

3033 2018-11-02 18:51:14 Actually it did lol. It's tied to the stock market which has drastically risen since the election. I have other stocks too which have also risen. I'm making more money, I'm happy. Thanks Trump.
3034 2018-11-02 18:51:05 Excellent.
I wonder also if the Tenants Union plan could be mirrored with a similar plan for small shareholders particularly in AIM stocks who usually get treated like crap by the self regulating blob of FCA, NOMADs, Crony Capitalist run firms etc
3035 2018-11-02 18:50:50 I've called all 6 Targets in the Orlando area and they're all completely sold out even the back stocks are sold out !!!!! THIS POWER #EXO_DONTMESSUPMYTEMPO

3038 2018-11-02 18:49:50 Not to self: Next time you set trailing stops or any take-profit-orders: be sure to scale out a bit. Make sure you're guaranteed profits, but keep a distance because it always dips quite a bit before the next run up. #crypto #trading #stocks #volatility
3039 2018-11-02 18:49:26 “Macera: ok i asked my coworker John and he said its someone who does investments for you like if you want to buy stocks or bonds or a pension plan”
3040 2018-11-02 18:49:25 Stocks are all time high.. the TV deals in India and big Saudi cash inflow all indicate otherwise.
3041 2018-11-02 18:49:05 Money managers always push valuations too high, run stocks up too far, then over-correct to the downside the same way. Average folks with 401ks, pensions tied to stocks can never get out at or before the top and get stuck holding, told don’t sell corrections,buy more. BS scam.

3044 2018-11-02 18:48:22 Chrom can fair to up B and trade stocks at any %?
3045 2018-11-02 18:48:06 @business @markets #The #USClose @scarletfu & @CarolineHydeTV :Tell #AriRunenstein & #RogerBrowne that ETFs are no enigmas. They are simply exchange traded Mutual Fund.Instead of selling at The NAV, Thry are simply traded like stocks & U can design one for all occasion. Big deal!
3046 2018-11-02 18:47:11 The red-money force in the United States will be filtered out. The heads of companies that are on the rise in stock prices are buying stocks from the state and banks for money.
3047 2018-11-02 18:46:54 Gotta learn how to use stocks
3048 2018-11-02 18:46:19 Ban killing the opponent. Melee tournaments are now based on doing perfect ledgedashes and you loose stocks by SD'ing
3049 2018-11-02 18:46:16 The White House seems to be actively trying to find out what will get the algos/investors to buy stocks leading into Nov 6 (not good long-term!) The game theory is tough on this, but it seems he would call it all handled leading into the midterms and then walk it all back?
3050 2018-11-02 18:45:55 The red-money force in the United States will be filtered out. The heads of companies that are on the rise in stock prices are buying stocks from the state and banks for money.
3051 2018-11-02 18:45:47 Large hedge fund friend says CIO asking all analysts for list of companies stocks hurt the most by China concerns where #s  and multiples are fine regardless.   Not easy task but everyone will be doing same.

3054 2018-11-02 18:45:26 The red-money force in the United States will be filtered out. The heads of companies that are on the rise in stock prices are buying stocks from the state and banks for money.
3055 2018-11-02 18:44:14 Btw, how do you plan to research these stocks?
3056 2018-11-02 18:43:47 I don't think my local Tesco even stocks Peroni. 
3057 2018-11-02 18:43:36 Was just looking on Stockommendation.  They don't seem to cover the Investors Chronicle.  Tom Winnifrith's record is pretty poor but that isn't exactly news.  Doesn't stop him tipping stocks like crazy though.  Hot Stocks Rockets has more losing tips then winners!!!
3058 2018-11-02 18:43:33 Trade issues with China will be an even bigger problem when all hell breaks loose and Trump imposes his 25% tariffs on all of China's exports. That could be the catalyst for the main event, the #crash in stocks.
3059 2018-11-02 18:43:31 Farmers have been supported by CAP (for all its faults) since 1972, let’s see how they will fayre when that support disappears ? As for fishermen, what will they fish once stocks are depleted ? That’s the whole point of quotas
3060 2018-11-02 18:43:18 All a buzz about the job numbers for October...in Obama’s last non election year (since they’ve been claiming stocks and jobs are based on elections) October 2015 jobs were 271,000 NON farm jobs, funny how this admins doesn’t report the non farming jobs
3061 2018-11-02 18:42:52 Best show for trading stocks isn't CNBC BS, it's General Hospital.  "I'm sorry, Laura.  We're separating."

COLD, MAN!
3062 2018-11-02 18:42:47 @BiomeGrow noticed your stocks are not trading today, but I can't find a press release to explain what's going on.
3063 2018-11-02 18:42:16 hi all so it is almost cold/flu season & if ur like me & live alone w/o many ppl to help out, remember it always helps to keep a tote full of supplies (meds, cough drops, tissues, soups/stocks, crackers, pedialite, heating pad/ice pack, etc) so ur not left w/o when it strikes!!
3064 2018-11-02 18:41:39 Even though some municipal authorities had stocks of stable iodine, they were not distributed.
3065 2018-11-02 18:41:38 I suspect that tons of savings plans are buying gazillion stocks in the first 2 days of each month, driving prices for a "cost-averaging effect", as they call it in their ads
3066 2018-11-02 18:41:36 Auto Ancillary stocks too rocked. Motherson,  Minda ..
3067 2018-11-02 18:40:57 wait till tries to make a range band for stocks like the onshore yuan via EO
3068 2018-11-02 18:40:56 And Kudlow said not even close and stocks dropping
3069 2018-11-02 18:39:36 Don't tell? The only secret is your manipulation of media, distraction from real issues. That all parties own stocks in insurance companies and censor any replies that mention it. Total blue or total red is a mistake.
3070 2018-11-02 18:39:24 And just because the stock market is "doing well" does not equate to better pay and more job opportunities. Believe it or not, many people don't have stocks. We need employers to take a moral stand and pay workers what they are worth. It's the right thing to do.
3071 2018-11-02 18:39:21 I have thought that for a while. The stocks goes down he and his sycophant cronies swoop in and buy on the cheap and then toss a bone out and the stocks go back up and they make money.
3072 2018-11-02 18:38:27 Mine was going YOLO on ACB and APH , buying my first stocks on the 13 of October!
3073 2018-11-02 18:37:57 Conveniently ignoring the fact that fishermen can only continue to catch fish when fish stocks are managed.  The EU quota system isn’t perfect by a long long way but we can’t keep taking from the oceans without putting back.
3074 2018-11-02 18:37:54 Nah it can definitely be faked. I know quite a few influencers who kid on to make money through stocks but they lie and make it through people signing up to their course
3075 2018-11-02 18:37:10 @traderstewie do you ever trade options or just stocks?
3076 2018-11-02 18:36:46 I don't know the answer, but pretty sure broad indexes are treated very differently than individual stocks. Targeted indexes for a region or country could of course be different.
3077 2018-11-02 18:36:41 New Ty Inc. Flippables now in store!   Small: £8.99 & Large: £14.99 .. Hurry while stocks last! 
3078 2018-11-02 18:36:31 Tax cuts had nothing to do with this. They had a lot to do with corps ability to but back 750 billion in stocks though. The rich keep getting richer.
3079 2018-11-02 18:35:53 Today summarized 

Markets open up on trade hopes

Markets fall on trade fears 

Kudlow: we’re not obsessed with the stock market

S&P dips to 2,700

Trump tweets more trade bullshit so stocks rise

3082 2018-11-02 18:34:16 Trump submits RSVP, reportedly going to order the Chicken Florentine at the G-20 summit dinner, stocks rally
3083 2018-11-02 18:34:09 stocks rally hard on an admitted liars tweet...
3084 2018-11-02 18:33:56 KEEP YOUR EYES AND EARS open for "good news" on trade talk. My bet is, true or not, stories will be floated out by the administration pushing a positive narrative...this will be an attempt to stop the bleeding in stocks.
3085 2018-11-02 18:33:30 Good point. Stocks can go sideways for a long time.
3086 2018-11-02 18:33:25 i alr bought the albums on amazom BUT I WANT THE COPIES NOW so i'm gonna have to call every target around my house to check. WHO BOUGHT ALL THE STOCKS?? EVEN THE STOCKS IN THE BACK???

3094 2018-11-02 18:29:52 no one wants to 'take your guns'... they said that about Obama for 8 years!!   the majority of Americans want more regs.. like no bump stocks, no AK-17's...  more control over domestic abusers (you know you've read the headlines where these guys kill their whole families!)...
3095 2018-11-02 18:28:37 Let’s be fair. No Dem in their right mind would support a gun ban across the board. Automatics are already banned. Bump stocks are too. Well-regulated would mean much stricter background checks/waiting periods and reinstating the laws making it harder for the mentally ill.
3096 2018-11-02 18:27:26 You should share the stocks you hold.
3097 2018-11-02 18:24:54 yes Trump has done a good job so far on economy. Stocks are higher, unemployment is down, etc. You see outside of Trumpistan people can think independently.. But this wasn't an econ discussion

Focus RR. Who is omitting funding for border security? Do you know what "omit" means?
3098 2018-11-02 18:24:24 The Stock Market is up massively since the Election, but is now taking a little pause - people want to see what happens with the Midterms. If you want your Stocks to go down, I strongly suggest voting Democrat. They like the Venezuela financial model, High Taxes & Open Borders!
3099 2018-11-02 18:23:49 Guess I’ll be keeping my $ out of stocks a while longer. Refuse to lose what I have with donnie and his dildos still in power.
3100 2018-11-02 18:23:46 There are two games people play: get rich now & get rich in 20 years.  The former is quite risky & complicated.  The latter relatively easy.  Most choose get rich now, most lose a lot of money.  #stocks #stockmarket
3101 2018-11-02 18:23:35 THEY  ARE  SCUM  . PUT THEM IN STOCKS  AND CUT OF RIGHT HAND  AND 30 YEARS IN  PRISON
3102 2018-11-02 18:23:17 @WattersWorld #wattersworld It would really be a shame to put the brakes on this finally growing exceptional economy with election of Socialist lefties to congress to put the brakes on it. Every aspect from wages to stocks in 401ks to employment are going up. Please don't stop it
3103 2018-11-02 18:21:55 @POTUS #POTUS It would really be a shame to put the brakes on this finally growing exceptional economy with election of Socialist lefties to congress to put the brakes on it. Every aspect from wages to stocks in 401ks to employment are going up. Please don't let it stop.
3104 2018-11-02 18:21:41 The Fannie Mae preferred stocks are running today, with the common flat. I like the preferred more (4-5X upside and a little safer since higher in the cap structure) and own some, but more active traders might want to keep an eye on $FNMA
3105 2018-11-02 18:21:33 Remember when bonds and stocks were inversely correlated? Ahhhh those were the good ole days!!!  $SPY $TLT
3106 2018-11-02 18:21:07 Bueno. Como muchas empresas . Si los móviles de $AAPL ya valen más de 1000$ es para tenerlos mas de 2 años . Es como las farmacéuticas , muchas inflan los precios un 400-500% cuando son exitosos , aunque vendan menos ganan más . Hasta que pierden la exclusiva de la patente.
3107 2018-11-02 18:20:25 @TheStoryFNC #TheStory It would really be a shame to put the brakes on this finally growing exceptional economy with election of Socialist lefties to congress to put the brakes on it.

3108 2018-11-02 18:20:00 CORRECTIONS AND BEARS CORRECTIONS AND BEARS -192 of the stocks in the S&P 500 are are down at least 10% YTD through Friday 10/26/18, while 103 down at least 20% YTD (source: BTN Research). #retirement #stocks #stockmarket
3109 2018-11-02 18:19:41 Bro its 11
But effectively 5 only because  rest of stocks accounts 4% of my portfolio
3110 2018-11-02 18:18:13 Trading, selling, and buying stocks. This should've been part of our electives in college!
3111 2018-11-02 18:17:19 Yes. And they love to tout the stock market but...many Americans don't have stocks and for some of us, our investment plans have taken a nose dive this year, stocks have been too volatile.
3112 2018-11-02 18:16:43 He honestly probably would've killed more people if he wasn't using bump stocks on some of the guns.
3113 2018-11-02 18:16:25 Complex strategies by Market players tend to control things and old school folks pick stocks they think are Fantastic 1 day and sold next day.
this is what causes TV to give out commentary. Good luck
3114 2018-11-02 18:16:19 No where else to go. Precious metals boring. Stocks at ATH and possibly bubble territory, no thanks the BTC bubble was enough. How much lower can it really go? Not zero, there’s always dumb people like me to pickup some bags lol
3115 2018-11-02 18:16:04 I would bet that the majority of shootings are committed by people not legally able to own guns and guns that are illegally purchased. Also, do you know what it takes to purchase a gun currently? Bump stocks are stupid and near impossible to control.
3116 2018-11-02 18:15:26 It's not really just stocks - which have been lately very volatile for the record. Job numbers are extremely good. But earnings are only now trickling up and haven't come close to catching the growth of expenses since 2008 - especially healthcare.
3117 2018-11-02 18:15:17 Sooo funny to see people blaming $Sx for their poor trading skill 

But of course no body blame $fat or other stocks that hit near 1$ and came back under 0.10
3118 2018-11-02 18:14:43 With China's economy going down... Are Chinese stocks now safe to buy? 
3119 2018-11-02 18:14:42 Stocks dropped like a Rock today! The DOW just erased a 198 point gain plus another 181 points LOWER! donald’s top economic advisor, Kudlow just told CNBC ‘there is NO trade plan in the works for China’!

3121 2018-11-02 18:14:18 I’m not sure how many legally purchased guns. Lots of them? The majority of them? But, for me, that suggest the laws are too lax and people have too much unfettered legal access to guns that allow them to walk into a hotel with dozen guns, some souped up with bump stocks.
3122 2018-11-02 18:14:02 No number. Strange but ok, what email can I send info to if I am having issues with the software. It stated to open a ticket but it doesn’t say how, and where to send it to.
3123 2018-11-02 18:13:33 All that 
And
Warren staunch dem may be George S  cook dumped the stocks to show Trump
They have enough money where they can
Average man suffers
3124 2018-11-02 18:13:20 @larry_kudlow @KellyannePolls Stocks DOWN BIG again today! NOT GOOD FOR US ON TUESDAY'S ELECTIONS - PLEASE ADDRESS!!
3125 2018-11-02 18:13:04 stocks are stagnant, I got regular raise, higher gas, higher interest rates, no tax break for me
3126 2018-11-02 18:12:10 It would really be a shame to put the brakes on this finally growing exceptional economy with election of Socialist lefties to congress to put the brakes on it.

3130 2018-11-02 18:11:26 I got one. I have a 403B and own several individual stocks like BRK.B as well. How about you.
3131 2018-11-02 18:11:20 Stocks will be tokenized and trades through the xRapid $xrp blockchain

3135 2018-11-02 18:10:09 Good stocks don't always translate to a good economy, the average person doesn't even have a month's wages saved up
3136 2018-11-02 18:09:52 I think stocks such as Quintiles/Iqvia and Cerner are a better way to play Healthcare demographics theme without product/regulatory risk. But they have all gotten bid up.
3137 2018-11-02 18:09:35 What value of coin though?We don't possess enough of either metal for general circulation, & there is the value of metal to consider too. It's impact on value of fiat, mainly created via private banks, & of course remaining stocks of each are a national asset.Thanks for reply btw
3138 2018-11-02 18:09:26 @StocksToTrade how can I get in touch with someone...
3139 2018-11-02 18:08:48 @StocksToTrade  what is your support number.!! I have been trying to find it for 3 hours.. what email can I send to have some help. This setup is ridiculous. I have a better chance on winning the lotto then get some help
3140 2018-11-02 18:05:12 @JustinTrudeau During summer months cdn and usa made billions pumping cannabis stocks last month they made billions shorting. Banks need to be regulated. They provoke stoploss but and sell orders by trading amongst themselves. U ethical
3141 2018-11-02 18:04:02 @sdbywf did you mistyped $230 by the close, if you wanted to short should have picked easy one like Chinese stocks
3142 2018-11-02 18:03:56 China has just executed a 10% devaluation over the past six months. U.S. stocks have started to sink again.

Now Trump and Mnuchin are saying, “Enough!” China will be penalized for their currency manipulation, weaker dollar is coming.zh
3143 2018-11-02 18:03:23 I will guarantee you that their product is better suited for stocks and bonds, it reminds of the professional feel of Armory's full node (but it's SPV).  But, I've never used ColoredCoins and can't find a video of someone using it so I don't know the specifics.
3144 2018-11-02 18:03:22 Maybe GM should get their butts in gear and produce affordable vehicles and not dump their employees and want bail outs while their top honchos are raking in millions. NO you did not lose millions in retirement accts..stocks back up, those same stocks that rose under Trump
3145 2018-11-02 18:02:27 Funny because stocks have been tanking over the last three months. Inflation is up. The cost of food and gas is up thanks to Trump’s policies. A lot of people are UNDER-EMPLOYED, but yeah. Great jobs report! Thanks Obama!
3146 2018-11-02 18:01:27 Once I buy stocks the go down, when I sell they go up...I’ll post my trading activity...you’re welcome!
3147 2018-11-02 17:58:19 Stocks go down almost every day these past 2 to 3 months
3148 2018-11-02 17:58:12 damn, stocks normally do well on fridays...
3149 2018-11-02 17:58:01 Tell that to the 90% of America  don’t own stocks and can’t pay rent with one job. You should be arrested  for propaganda and lying.
3150 2018-11-02 17:56:29 Le carburant est soumis à une fiscalité trop lourde en Côte d'Ivoire. Ensuite il y a des prélèvements inutiles qui sont en place depuis des décennies : stocks de sécurité, péréquation transport, fond d'entretien routier...
3151 2018-11-02 17:56:18 APPL just hit the -10% official correction territory..

Many tech stocks led that march down.

Who's next?
3152 2018-11-02 17:55:11 Stocks are down because the debt is through the roof.

3163 2018-11-02 17:50:28 So the Chlorion stocks its nest with multiple crickets, not sure if it is a hard fast rule, but don't parasitoids only utilize one host per life stage? Maybe it can be a predator and a parasitoid, with parasitoid being a sub-category of predator?

3184 2018-11-02 17:43:44 Yes. Sector weights are equal to those in the MSCI USA. Weights stocks within sectors based on a value score that is based on fwd. P/E, P/B, EV/CFO for all sectors save financials where it uses just fwd P/E and P/B. Point being: don't stop at "value", the devil's in the details.

3191 2018-11-02 17:39:11 I've been mildly interested in stocks since the old "Wall Street Week With Louis Rukeyser," days and I've noticed over the years that what's good for Wall Street and what's good for Main Street often seem to be at opposites.

3254 2018-11-02 17:13:37 These are incorrect assumptions. Many large companies we're sitting on large amounts of cash before the TCJA was passed. They, then, gave their tax cuts to investors by dividends. Over 80% of stocks are owned by the richest 10% of people. This just helped more rich people.
3255 2018-11-02 17:13:36 Not all forms of modified bump stocks are illegal...lol!!!  You know that...so the bait and switch/gaslighting is not going to work.  The issue made regarding the constitution concerns intent not simple semantics.  But you definitely helped make my point. Thanks brother...

3275 2018-11-02 17:07:20 Seems like the size of today's move in stocks is mostly a function of the size of the mid-week rally which was mostly function of the size of the October decline. Volatility begets volatility.

3282 2018-11-02 17:03:47 Those aren't cheap enough. Neither V or MA are value stocks. If they sell off and get cheaper, I'm sure he'd be interested. But until then, it's a no go.
3283 2018-11-02 17:03:46 Thanks! No, the focus is exclusively on the transatlantic bubbles in corporate stocks and bonds, not on the later public debt crises.
3284 2018-11-02 17:03:06 Great Market  , in one expiry its going down like no return and the next it up 40% in two three sessions. Only God(operator) knows what is destiny of the stocks.
3285 2018-11-02 17:02:29 “Severe corrections lead to long stretches when nothing happens, nobody is bragging about stocks at cocktail parties, and the investor’s patience is sorely tested. Dedicated stock pickers begin to feel as lonely as vacationers at off-season resorts.” -Peter Lynch
3286 2018-11-02 17:02:20 Sort of a lot of people just sold off there tech stocks as they were falling which cause the market to shift and WWE is an entertainment/ tech company right now

3289 2018-11-02 17:01:35 No, but his hyperbolic tweet claim about a deal w/ China being close manipulated global stocks higher last nite & US futures too. That wore off quick b/c WH sources already backed away from the claim. And we know Trump gossips w/ his buddies on an unsecure iPhone.
3290 2018-11-02 17:01:35 The best set up to short stocks in years (SPX) is in downtrend and the (VIX) is in uptrend. The (VIX) has gone from isolated and episodic to trending.
3291 2018-11-02 17:01:25 A few of my favorite dividend paying stocks: $MMM, $JNJ, $PG, $WMT, $ABBV, and since I love tech $TXV. Why these companies? They are leaders of industry and generate enough cash to expand and pay investors.

3300 2018-11-02 16:59:02 LOL! 86% of companies were blacked out from buybacks for weeks in Oct, the primary driver of stocks all year. Not rocket science.
3301 2018-11-02 16:58:31 True . Value stocks working better
3302 2018-11-02 16:58:26 Make sure you talk about clean coal and all the steel mills that are opening. Where is my tax cut cut you said we would have before Election Day? Where is the action on bump stocks you said on October 1 would be done soon? You,sir, are full of shit
3303 2018-11-02 16:58:18 Not a bad day in the pf , overall this week has been a pleasant surprise. Diversity is key. Not buying shite stocks helps  enjoy folks
3304 2018-11-02 16:58:08 Stocks skid to session lows as Kudlow refutes report that Trump asked for a draft of a China-U.S. trade pact
3305 2018-11-02 16:57:33 El de inmuebles no puede ser tomado como un Mercado de stocks, tenes que aunar miles de voluntades para tener en cuenta cómo algo gral (Mercado). Acá los precios no están inflados con crédito y el prop no es deudor, a la inversa que en otros países.
3306 2018-11-02 16:57:16 And now they’re lost. If you got smacked buying FAANG, what’s your strategy today? Just double down on all your tech favorites? $KHC showing another sign of “safe” stocks not being safe!
3307 2018-11-02 16:55:09 So, are you protecting your family by selling all real estate and stocks to buy bonds and gold?
3308 2018-11-02 16:54:32 Look on the bright side we get 3 stocks. Lol
3309 2018-11-02 16:53:13 Sold my $CGC stocks today before it dipped too low. I don't see it going much above $38 anytime soon. Buy other #PotStocks on a dip? Maybe! Focus more on US #Cannabis stocks I think.
3310 2018-11-02 16:52:46 Yeah but we can't probably because smash fans are too scared of them taking entire stocks when if you set stocks to 4 is the equivalent of a special in another game taking 1/4th of the enemy's health
3311 2018-11-02 16:52:21 That's spot on MT - and also worth realising that Short Term Trading is extremely difficult and most of us simply can't do it. Anyone can buy a Portfolio of decent Stocks.
3312 2018-11-02 16:51:57 I have been wondering the same. Would love to invest in Gab, but not sure if I want to invest in the none-voting (class B) stocks..
3313 2018-11-02 16:51:24 If you had stocks you would know it crashed back to what it us.18,000 salary people are getting either layoffs or a buyout. I know all about trade deals.
3314 2018-11-02 16:51:11 as long as meter doesnt charge when u camp, im 100% down with adding more stocks and meter. Not only will it make worse characters better but it'll also make the game more fun to watch
3315 2018-11-02 16:50:54 I'm taking out stocks in tissues,the dems will be needing a lot of them once the RED WAVE hits
3316 2018-11-02 16:50:53 US stocks take another leg lower. A nervous run to the close likely now
3317 2018-11-02 16:50:47 Do I really need to buy stocks before the midterm election?

I see possibility for big downside if they go a certain way.

But not big upside if they go the other way. The move up would be slow and cautious, would have plenty of time to get in.
3318 2018-11-02 16:50:41 But of course I won't be buying Stocks on insane Valuations like when Dotcom hit. If a Quality Stock at reasonable Value falls in Price then it's an opportunity to buy more. I am happy to hold for long long time if Business is still doing OK and no obvious challenges ahead.

3332 2018-11-02 16:47:56 A Fantastic Week in Stocks and Currency Exchange
This was very great,we have closed all our trades,we have about 18% maximum drawdown but after its recovery, we end the week with about 36% profit,one of the things amazing; one of our trades gave us 120pips..To God be the glory.
3333 2018-11-02 16:47:11 Shouldn’t we then expect to see the jobs concentrated in specific sectors or regions based on your assumption?  I don’t think the market is cheap but I also don’t see a bubble with the exception of a few sectors such as pot stocks and the cloud

3374 2018-11-02 16:31:23 i am also interested in that as well. direct purchase from the company would be cool. Did it with Zion Oil and though their stocks have been slow, its still a good investment when you believe in something.

3386 2018-11-02 16:28:28 Yes, i could guess it from your posts. However, how do you pick these  stocks ? Any screener or just by analysing 100 of charts in a day and selecting few based on momentum ?
3387 2018-11-02 16:27:26 The top five stocks higher at noon today are $VRSN, $NWL, $SBUX, $SYMC, and $ANET.

3389 2018-11-02 16:26:44 U.S. stocks gave up overnight gains on Friday after White House officials told CNBC there is no imminent trade deal with China, contrary to reports. Disappointing news from Apple also weighed on investors, a strong jobs report increased the fear of interest rates rising further.
3390 2018-11-02 16:26:27 I think I'll ponder about those white suburban dads & seniors in NYT article I RTed - def. touch it in my next article. They are embarrassed of Trump (now he's tweeting the promised sanctions as if it's a WWE PPV), but happy with how their stocks go up.

3395 2018-11-02 16:24:25 So on the PEG stocks, either Gap up or Gap down, the idea is that the bullish flag pattern that often seems to appear is a "Gap Fill" and indicates a higher move up? OR move down with a Bearish Flag pattern?

3450 2018-11-02 16:05:35 It's that 90Kt 'Other' that really creates the disparity between producer estimates (arguably biased but expert) and analyst estimates (arguably unbiased but generalist): the 'hidden' or 'off-exchange' stocks. Macquarie, Roskill, S&P, all feel that it is closer to 200-500Kt

3482 2018-11-02 15:55:16 Stocks is a different story. That's why I prefaced it with "for futures traders"...and I've traded in a futures prop firm.
3483 2018-11-02 15:54:34 My opinion was less connected to the crowd and more connected to probabilities after 3 straight 1+% days. Chasing stocks, particularly when you have not proven to left a downtrend is not a good risk/reward.
3484 2018-11-02 15:54:06 All the other stocks are GDP plus growth stocks, who in the hell wants that?
3485 2018-11-02 15:53:24 good to know. So does that mean it prioritizes sector weighting first, i.e,. a sector-specific value "screen" that happens once a sector weight is established? As opposed to just a benchmark-level screen of the *cheapest* stocks
3486 2018-11-02 15:53:22 To be fair to @colhutch he's damned if he does and damned if he doesn't. If he didn't say anything people would have also been up in arms about lack of information. #ast

3536 2018-11-02 15:34:14 $MDB is one of the few speculative stocks which held up relatively well and rose quickly back to former highs during this reaction rally.
3537 2018-11-02 15:34:11 not sure grabbed on the dip but starting to think folks have abandon this one. in otc not all stocks bounce.
3538 2018-11-02 15:33:52 I miss my HTC's crazy filters ;~;. You are a few stocks like $F and then!
3539 2018-11-02 15:32:57 Yep. That's how it goes so often. When im on the sidelines watching, prices skyrocket. When I'm in it just sits, goes down a little, comes back up a little...

3552 2018-11-02 15:29:14 US more dependent on China imho. China could crash US stocks overnight by devaluing the yuan. US stocks = 150% of US GDP and the primary driver of Fed Tax Receipts. China knows this. Why they're not feeling any pressure at all to get a deal done. US on the other hand? 
3553 2018-11-02 15:29:12 Adulthood is weird. As a kid I was worried if they were serving mozzarella sticks in the cafeteria at lunch and now im monitoring stocks to make sure I can retire in 45 years

3560 2018-11-02 15:25:30 All the major stock indices have turned down today.  My portfolio would also be down if it weren't for one of my battered stocks popping 15%.  2018 will probably be a lost year for stocks.

3568 2018-11-02 15:22:12 $djx $djia $dji reached a level this morning when it was up 1% which mirrors both crashes of 1929 & 1987. 
Now is not such a bad time to sell some stocks for cash &/or buy some Vix “portfolio insurance”. If we go down 6% indices any day in next week or two b scared
3569 2018-11-02 15:22:06 Stocks going down, NZD not. That's also interesting (keeping in mind the record shorts via CFTC data) and if stocks bounce, the NZDUSD may be trading at highs sooner rather than later.
3570 2018-11-02 15:21:40 Not a good move,

3579 2018-11-02 15:16:18 Interesting theory from @DrPippaM on Bloomberg. Higher rates signal stronger economy but rates still so low doesn’t negatively affect stocks, higher inflation makes cash/bonds poor choices so equities higher.

3642 2018-11-02 14:55:46 You may be right about there being a lot of stocks in the future, but I don't think it follows that you will need AI. If you are indexing, you can still just own all the stocks as you do now. Not much more effort. If you are picking individual stocks, you don't have to own all.

3645 2018-11-02 14:53:42 no, the return in USD is not similar because the rand has died since 2012 [which is a major part of the reason that the stocks' rand value has increased].
3646 2018-11-02 14:53:15 @Varneyco Its funny you bring on these so called talking heads to talk about stocks etc. but somehow they make prediction that the House will go Dims. Ask them how they know and they will point at the fake polls(including Fox poll). Listen to T.Bruce
she has a better feel for it.
3647 2018-11-02 14:53:05 You will need AI to manage stocks.
Because there are going to be a lot more stocks.

3656 2018-11-02 14:50:01 Stocks go up
Stocks go down
Some to the moon
Some to the ground
You can try to choose
But you may just lose
A forecast you do
May not come through
But if you manage risk
And cut those that miss
You stand a chance
To advance.

3658 2018-11-02 14:48:46 If you're new to trading or have a small account, my advice to you is never waste your time and capital buying low floats. Short low float stocks. Im not saying short aimlessly, but your bias should lean to the short side at least 90% of the time. $YECO $CIFS $INPX

3664 2018-11-02 14:47:04 If you are looking for answer to this question on Twitter, then stocks are not fit you at the moment. It's better to invest in mutual fund instead, till you yourself know the answer.

I haven't.

MDY and S&P never do that because they deeply understand that transparency and neutrality are key consideration to maintain thier reputation as a reliable rating agency.

3692 2018-11-02 14:38:17 It comes down to economic environments. October was one of weakening expected growth and lower inflation. This hurts stocks and commodities, and helps bonds. If inflation fears had instead picked up, then it would have helped commodities, but hurt equities.

3779 2018-11-02 14:09:01 Apparently when "trading was unavailable" the orders actually did go through, so they double-filled sale orders that left me short stocks I did not want to be short, and had to then cover the orders...what a mess
3780 2018-11-02 14:08:36 @MSNBC announced the Employment numbers. 250,000 new jobs for October. 
Stock Market is up 100+ pts today. 
The host said “most people don’t buy Stocks, half right as usual.  Most people don’t  buy and sell individual stocks, BUT 53,000,000 Americans have 401s  up over 30%
3781 2018-11-02 14:08:15 no clue.  Been in the investing business many years and day to day moves impossible to predict.  I have a 18-24 month outlook and on that basis I would be a buyer of all quality U stocks

3792 2018-11-02 14:05:55 Adding more jobs than needed is a recipe for disaster. Companies will have to lay people off, stocks will be sold off, and we will be in a recession once again.

3796 2018-11-02 14:03:19 Shareholders are people; mostly the small handful (1-2%) that own around 80% of stocks. And before you start talking down to all the ‘takers’ remember that the only reason you can earn income simply by owning shares is that somebody else is doing the work to gen. that income.

3804 2018-11-02 14:01:37 Indian economy is growing day by day. Hence rural theme stocks will gain most. U can try ur luck in those stocks . Consumer theme stocks also have potential.

3806 2018-11-02 14:00:44 min wage jobs
wages are NOT up
83 straight months of job growth under Obama, unemployment went from 10% -4% and Stocks up 250% You were Handed a very good economy & what did you do, add almost 2 trillion to the deficit in what, 18 months.. FACTS MATTER.
3807 2018-11-02 14:00:21 Imagine being a money manager who hated Obama so when he said in March '09: "It's safe to go out and buy stocks again." you were like "psh, typical liberal lies!" and then, you started shorting through 2009 to fade what was surely a fake move.

Imagine passing on BTC in 2011.

3812 2018-11-02 13:59:19 This headline is misleading. Job growth is due to storm recovery. Wage growth is not keeping up with inflation. Jobs will soon be shed due to the trade war- companies have already announced coming massive layoffs. The debt is skyrocketing due to the tax scam. Stocks down.

3818 2018-11-02 13:58:24 For a value investor , a downturn is an opportunity to own some high quality stocks. I bought $ADBE yesterday. The company is firing on all cylinders as a software as a service CO. Forty percent of it’s revenue is free cash clow.

3832 2018-11-02 13:52:45 Funny, Has been on an upward climb since President Obama.
My Stocks have risen but wages stagnant. There is no middle class anymore, only the working poor.
3833 2018-11-02 13:52:13 It might not be a bad idea to remember that good "values" in stocks that have acted terribly this year (or longer) are subject to tax selling at this time of the year. Their values may get better still. $SPX $NDX $IWM

3835 2018-11-02 13:51:37 artfully crafted manipulation as usual. media using the same system to dissuade middle class retail investors from opportunity. i have seen this happen in stocks, commodities and everything else.
3836 2018-11-02 13:51:37 Thanks for the reply. I guess my point was whether your measure of internals is a good leading indicator or does it essentially move concurrently with stocks. Basically, is it predictive?

3848 2018-11-02 13:47:13 Speaking of shooting. I heard another person say, "Guns don't kill people. People kill people." Sure. People kill MORE people, MORE easily, MORE quickly, WITH guns, especially with ARs and bump stocks. "Guns don't kill people" is a specious argument. We need sensible reforms.
3849 2018-11-02 13:47:08 If we at or near full employment, adding more jobs is not good. If there is no one to fill those positions, companies will have to downsize and stock holders will revolt and sell off their stocks. You can have too much of a good thing.

3895 2018-11-02 13:38:15 @RobinhoodApp I need someone to DM me. I have a problem with one of my stocks not being listed.
3896 2018-11-02 13:38:00 These forex,BITCOIN,STOCKS guys will just sell you dreams..the joining fee is just the money they make....
3897 2018-11-02 13:37:34 I would like to personally see a huge short squeeze today, but it may be tough looking at $AAPL  & you may see people taking profits in  stocks like $AMZN capping the upside as they rallied a lot from their lows ; $BABA is on the lows $SPY $ES
3898 2018-11-02 13:37:33 When are you guys going to realize this doesn’t mean diddly squat to the majority of Americans?

Wages are stagnant. A lot of us are working multiple jobs. We don’t have stocks. The price of food, gas, utilities are rising. 

But yeah the economy is great. Smh
3899 2018-11-02 13:37:15 You got the biggest deficits to pay for tax scam for the rich and the Trumps. Those companies took that and bought stocks to make more money and didn’t invest it on their workers. My healthcare choices are getting worse cause my company doesn’t want to pay a higher cost.

3924 2018-11-02 13:32:42 Ok, you first, Mr. Executive Order. Ban bump-stocks. Increase fire arms background checks. Ban large capacity clips. Do that, then you can go “Booga-Booga” over the fake “invasion”.
You are a fraud, and the world knows it.

3928 2018-11-02 13:32:05 I actually think this is a PPT operation and Trump is driving up stocks ahead of Tuesday. It's political move using the stock market as propaganda. It's also a massive short-squeeze

3942 2018-11-02 13:26:22 Off course, this seems likely. Trump is soft because he wants stocks up before the election and Xi is hoping for a November surprise from Mueller or the ballot box. If the @gop maintains the majority Trump will demand concessions Xi won't give him.

3946 2018-11-02 13:25:39 I’d say quite abit. There are SOME that fudge the numbers when selling cars, insurance, & stocks. Polling numbers are skewed a lot. High school basketball teams skew the height of players. It is all people doing this as you say, but they provide numbers to benefit themselves.

No confidence in their own stocks, much less to invest in expansion. Paying their existing workers more now, their debt is at higher rates now, Fed hikes not finished.

The  reason China owns a lot if them is since the late 70s they no longer out pace inflation and are less attractive than stocks. Cause was dropping the gold standard

4011 2018-11-02 12:56:31 #Trump did this and that. Honestly, what has he done for the average American? Jobs were going in that direction, stocks were going in that direction, #TaxCuts did nothing, now #SocialSecurity #Medicare will pay for it, that's elderly and poor. #HateSpeech he does very well.
4012 2018-11-02 12:56:01 Stocks getting set to open higher today after employment report shows gain of 250K jobs in the US.
4013 2018-11-02 12:55:11 you could...but you would run smack into the problem that bump stocks were given the ok by the Obama administration.

4015 2018-11-02 12:54:13 I'm no expert, but as long as the dollar drops while  the 10 year rises, it's a compensatory metric that offset the other stocks will go up . I could be wrong and at a certain level it will crash but check out Venezuela there markets are booming
4016 2018-11-02 12:53:31 Why not just trade in stocks?

4020 2018-11-02 12:51:59 Depends on magazine capacity, how easily it's alterable  large & easily changed out clips, bump stocks etc. My dad went deer hunting, I have no issue with people wanting or needing a gun for hunting  or protection, but having something that turns a person into a one many army, no
4021 2018-11-02 12:51:17 There are some really nice stocks in the non-crypto space that people should be paying attention to...

4022 2018-11-02 12:51:02 It’s argued stocks aren’t overvalued b/c interest rates are so low. This argument is flawed b/c it’s based on a hidden assumption they’ll stay low into the distant future. Want proof this prediction is faulty: look at today’s yield curve.
4023 2018-11-02 12:50:57 The economy is on a sugar high from borrowing money from these kid's charge cards. On the one yr anniversary of the Las Vegas shooting, the Federal govt can't even ban bump stocks. If the kids ever figure out they have power to change this...but they don't vote!

4042 2018-11-02 12:44:04 @Speeders258 because, he's new in trading, and I learn so much from him, and @madaz because he actually shares tickers of stocks he traded. I don't see that many people using his style of sharing, so it makes him one of a kind . Plus, you can learn so much from him, too.

4047 2018-11-02 12:41:14 Ever notice on @CNBC, any analyst that ever says anything negative says its not now, but 1-3 years out. They are so afraid to be negative if the market rallies.

4086 2018-11-02 12:22:30 Seems to me, and sense from other participants is expectation is we will see a sector rotation here. Industrials? Utilities? Defensive stocks?

4090 2018-11-02 12:20:35 So the stocks started to rebound on news that we were close to deal with China and now news is saying that was false.

Someone is manipulating things. Just like before the 1929 crash.
4091 2018-11-02 12:20:06 Kept my kids away from tech until senior in HS. No phone until college. Now we spend human time with each other most weekends, cook, watch movies & TV, talk about stocks to trade & what is important to them these days. Close time is fun.
4092 2018-11-02 12:19:46 Good point Steve. On checking YTD progress, I could have held onto gains by selling either using trailing stops or stops with reference to 52W highs. Some stocks have pulled back hugely, & whilst I take a long term view, perhaps I should/ could have avoided giving up these gains.

4110 2018-11-02 12:09:19 The economy is not great.That’s a false narrative. Everything is costing us more. Most people don’t have stocks or retirement savings. They live paycheck to paycheck. Interest rates are on the rise. Gas cost more. People are working more. How about child care and health care.

4112 2018-11-02 12:07:56 Talking w/ @charlieherman @WNYC, @byHeatherLong shows how poor US economics reporting is:

4259 2018-11-02 10:38:57 I considered taking an opening position in the last couple of weeks but didn't because of the percentage of FANG stocks making up the portfolio, which are so highly rated, though I accept I could well be losing out as a result. Maybe after a market crash ....

4285 2018-11-02 10:18:54 131 There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.

私たちの株式投資への意欲をそぐような要因がかなりある。
4286 2018-11-02 10:17:52 Iran Oil waiver = Crude down

China deal = stocks up

... midterms

anyway... there are always 1000 reasons stocks can go up and down. Markets breathe.

Italy was the subject. And Italian Business confidence is at 4Y low. Because their Interest Rates are at 4Y HIGH. hello !!
4287 2018-11-02 10:17:30 It is time to for T-20 matches. Stocks are running for 2-4 days and after that even good result is not giving good return. But for long term, it is a good time.
4288 2018-11-02 10:17:17 A lot of individuals are saying that this is the start of the crash. This could be true ( nobody knows ). However getting corrections like the one we just had helps to keep the market from ‘overheating’ a drawdown of 30-40% in some stocks to me is a buying opp #stocks #trading
4289 2018-11-02 10:15:56 For stocks 1:1.2 and for index 1:1.5
4290 2018-11-02 10:14:45 Also we can add IT in long term wealth creation - TCS, Infosys, HCLT, Wipro. I always remember by a mnemonic FPI-B. The core PF stocks should in FMCG, Pharma, IT and BFSI to create wealth in long term. Health means pharma. Hospital stocks sulk.
4291 2018-11-02 10:14:09 Stocks close slightly higher, trimming earlier gains
4292 2018-11-02 10:13:30 Il est temps que les instances étatiques et supra-étatiques jouent leur rôle et obligent les laboratoires pharmaceutiques à constituer des stocks de médicaments pour éviter les nombreuses pénuries inacceptables, dans un contexte de mondialisation de la production. #sante #pénurie
4293 2018-11-02 10:12:56 $BABA May the force be with us bulls! In Asia Tencent rallied 9% I am sure we can at least replicate this feat today #stocks #earnings
4294 2018-11-02 10:12:55 The fact that mining stocks never moved much over last 10 months  indicated that MMs kept them down just to demotivate the investors and make them quit. Tide is abt to turn now.
4295 2018-11-02 10:12:48 We have the second largest fleet and second largest catch in the EU.  Catches have been in decline since 19thC, but most dramatically since the 70s to protect fish stocks which we on the verge of being wiped out.
4296 2018-11-02 10:10:49 Why flip of calendar to Nov. could save stocks   6:00 AM EDT Nov 2, 2018
4297 2018-11-02 10:10:25 I was going to buy stocks in proctology but the bottom fell out.
4298 2018-11-02 10:09:49 I've always suspected that it's way higher than usual since his dad works in the finance industry and Kibum's clearly shown a lot of interest in money management (and he's cheap AF ). And Kim Gura mentioned on Radio Star how Kibum always butts into discussions about stocks haha
4299 2018-11-02 10:08:39 TOP FIVE MARKET UPDATE

4389 2018-11-02 08:54:20 Depends on the stock. Coca cola doesn't have much room for growth as it's already gone mainstream, but it is stable and will yield decent dividends. Some other stocks might have more growth potential even if they'd be more volatile and less likely to pay dividends.
4390 2018-11-02 08:53:54 so true - buy to let in the UK has been taxed too heavy and with Brexit coming up is less yield than depositing with Nexo.

4421 2018-11-02 08:30:01 (Bloomberg) -- Stocks extended gains globally, Treasuries dropped and the dollar fell on Friday as a buoyant mood swept markets on the back of fresh hopes for trade between the world’s two biggest economies. Crude oil fell.

4423 2018-11-02 08:28:35 Yes !! Low volume stocks reacts to market all the time , but they are not volatile like high volume. That's why I get little time to think about new strategy. Ex. When market changes it's Trend , stock increases it's spread so I consider this as opportunity and book big profits

4567 2018-11-02 06:16:54 Used to be rising stocks reflected a strong country and a healthy economy. Now the US has given up on the economy & the country and just focuses on stocks.

4612 2018-11-02 05:35:52 You guys are the high school rejects that make dumb jokes about people’s religion and ethnicity.  Then you get punched in the face and want to sue someone.  Tough guy Johnny and his audience Jackie Tran.  If you want to talk stocks talk stocks, religion jokes are corny and washed
4613 2018-11-02 05:35:32 Bullshit. That's not what valuations mean. You need real money to pay for stuff while stocks are just an expected, perceived value. Even if traders did buy at the top and sold at the bottom, the amount they lost is not "~$22.5 billion". Stop spreading lies, please.
4614 2018-11-02 05:33:45 Most importantly, it will take time to understand the market. And your instinctive decisions when stocks move. Start smaller. Wait for at least a year, to understand yourselves. People who lose a lot initially say stock market is gamble. No. It is not.

4628 2018-11-02 05:22:17 Use this volatility to build a great portfolio for long-term & don't sell great businesses for 5-6% short-term profits.
Holding great stocks will enhance your portfolio returns 4-5% in long-run, even 2% improvement in LR is great.

4658 2018-11-02 04:54:38 Always "ain't it a scam" or "its a scam" "uses all this power to get just a coin" 9/10 responses to me trying to convince friends. Even ones ive been friends with for near 30 years. Some go nah, stocks for me. 95% think blockchain is btc.
4659 2018-11-02 04:52:44 Because my portfolio was down by 12% since September 2018 due to it i was unable to take other stock entries and i did my math on money management, where KILITCH was giving me around 22% and settling my to 8% on whole so i made an EXIT and that helped me to enter other stocks.
4660 2018-11-02 04:52:36 Because the sovereign wealth fund owns a lot of the country...? This would just circle back to how to weight government ownership over stocks of wealth versus spending.

4671 2018-11-02 04:45:27 after trading in Index, which one you prefer , stocks or index ?
4672 2018-11-02 04:45:17 See Area 1 of EFW. Say that current EFW A1 gets a half weight and "stocks of wealth" gets half weight in new A1. I think if you do that and assume Singapore would score a zero for "stocks of wealth," Singapore would stay in the top 10 in EFW and Venezuela would stay in bottom 10.

1) Take only limited positions
2) Sell stocks which are cost-to-cost
3) Sell high debt companies on every rally, if not done yet
If pullback extends, the third round of corrections will be more intense and volatile

4740 2018-11-02 03:50:14 i still call bs on @clairecmc for killing a bill that would and should have included mental illness. but it seems their more worried about stuff like bump stocks or military looking weapons which arent.

4778 2018-11-02 03:26:36 We’ve been in a bull market since 2009. It’s pretty common for growth to outperform value during a bull market. Value also got hurt even more after the crisis since value stocks include many financial institutions who suffered.
4779 2018-11-02 03:26:32 So funny.  okay okay-I will never abbreviate 'Commander" again. I have been schooled! the correct ways are: Comd. or Cmdr. I wonder if we caused corn stocks to go up?

4781 2018-11-02 03:21:44 I think Growth outpacing Value is mainly due to low interest rates after 2008. More capital for growth to invest = more speculation. While value stocks tend to pay dividends and maintain their market share. Interest rates are going up slowly and value should do well.
4782 2018-11-02 03:20:38 The most crooked promoters operate stocks, buy & sell on the sly & get out leaving retail and MFs holding the can.

The stupid lot starts to believe their own lies. They Sink with the ship, retail & institutions.  

A 3rd category think investors owe it all to them.

4851 2018-11-02 02:39:54 Yes. There are many factors here. The value of US stocks & the value of the dollar are inverse for the time being based on trade effects (net exports/imports, each based on value) 

Dollar weak = we export more
Dollar strong = we buy more 

China kept dollar week for trade

4858 2018-11-02 02:31:36 Last month was one of the worst in years for stocks, with the S&P 500 down 6.9% for its largest monthly drop since September 2011. In addition to snapping its 6-month win streak, the S&P 500 fell 16 days for the month, tying the most down days for any month since October 2008.

U.S.  stocks rose for a third day, continuing a torrid rebound from the  October sell-off as investors greeted the latest batch of earnings  optimistically amid signs of easing trade tension.
4876 2018-11-02 02:17:54 South Korean stocks led the advance, and along with rising Japanese shares took this week’s rally close to 3 percent. Gains came after a phone call between Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping showed the door is still open for U.S.-China trade talks.
4877 2018-11-02 02:17:47 Asian stocks built on the best weekly rally since September, stoked by hopes for trade talks and China stimulus. That offset underwhelming news from Apple Inc. that weighed on Nasdaq futures.

4891 2018-11-02 01:57:35 Watching your course for the second time atm. It’s helped tremendously already by giving me a framework of how to trade based on how stocks move.

4897 2018-11-02 01:51:15 Stocks turned down in 2016 and when they returned to $100 era level OPEC said they could cut. The Saudi stock had hit a low and they were liquidating. @rajasark can you polish this off?

4900 2018-11-02 01:47:56 Tough one. If it's a middle income earner I start by asking if he thinks it's okay that Trump promises a 10% TAX CUT with no intention to keep that promise. If he's into stocks I show the DOW development since early 2009 and a close up 2018 YTD = screeching halt of upward trend.

4905 2018-11-02 01:43:04 Many stocks at this point are about a simple question.  "Do you have pricing power above and beyond the input inflation you deal with?"  $AAPL does.  To the point where they are answering "Fuck you, pay me"

Investor who are feared with bear market don't expect that during Bull market you don't loose money.
2017 was a BULL MARKET but still many people lost money in many stocks.

So dont think of too much about bull or bear market, just stick to quality stocks.

4963 2018-11-02 00:55:17 Sorry, don’t take TV dramas as legal authority. And SEC has authority over securities traders (its the S in SEC) - not business activities generally. SEC could ban XOM from selling stocks, can’t ban them from selling oil.
4964 2018-11-02 00:54:45 About 2 get reversed if business' enemy, Dumbs take the House.  I predict these things 2 happen:  Fire arm sales sky rocket, stocks drop, production slow, massive layoffs, industry exit America, Crime & drug use increase, college enrollment & debt increase.

4973 2018-11-02 00:45:46 Thx. Seeing this now and this is what I’m hoping to purchase with my limit at 5.5. Didn’t get it today.

4974 2018-11-02 00:44:46 I think that’s fair - especially given that most txns are speculators trading rather than other economic uses of the chain(s). 

Do you feel the same way about TA  and trading as it pertains to Forex and stocks?

4978 2018-11-02 00:38:31 What stocks or ETFs are you feeling most bullish about for November?  And on the flip side what are you most bearish about for November?  Looking for long or short ideas...
4979 2018-11-02 00:38:06 Look at your past buys and sells against long term charts of the stocks you’ve bought and sold and you’ll get an idea where you fit it.

4988 2018-11-02 00:29:41 Too many puns on the post.... it’s like people in crypto don’t take stocks seriously or something
4989 2018-11-02 00:28:07 What’s scary about? Stocks go up and stocks go down and then they go up and then they go down.....and over time they up more than they go down. Such is life.
4990 2018-11-02 00:26:36 Yes it’s typically because they want the play to run to a higher sp but not always to unload. Just got to know when to hold em and know when to fold em. Seen many of stocks walked up to ridiculous valuations. I have np being part of the ride up just got to know when to get off.

4997 2018-11-02 00:21:19 I fully support the reintroduction of the stocks and the pillory and why weren’t they named & shamed and why did you blur their “faeces”?, at least show us what they look like.
4998 2018-11-02 00:21:10 No, in general. You are taking less risk with 20 stocks opposed to 10. Yes, you limit your upside some to your point. But it's less risk

5011 2018-11-02 00:08:35 October wasn't a good month, but it helped me a lot. Why? It forced me to sit down and analyze ALL of my stocks AGAIN! I dumped $BB because I failed to do my proper homework

Also got lucky and dumped ALL my weedstocks before legalization.

5012 2018-11-02 00:08:32 I guess you should buy stocks then. No need to argue.
5013 2018-11-02 00:08:18 I actually do the same!  Don't get me wrong, I don't have "Patricia Heaton" money, but we've done fine. My financial freedom was solved with commercial real estate. I would ask Dave to suggest this more than stocks.. Real Estate makes more millionaires than stocks.

5019 2018-11-02 00:06:17 To safely make 300$ a day (1.5k a week) @ 5% in stocks, you need 30k. To safely invest that, it has to be 2% of your total worth. To safely make 1.5k a week, you need to be worth 1.5mil. I'll wait..
5020 2018-11-02 00:06:05 Understanding stocks is simple when you realize that you are buying a company:

-Earnings going down? Not good
-High Debt? Not good
-No clear competitive advantage? Not good
-Everybody is hyped about it? Def. not good!

Yet people keep buying stocks with no earnings

$IWM, $FXE, $GLD, $TLT, $XLE for strangles and straddles and $SPX and $RUT for put calendars when IVR is realy low. Pretty boring, but it let’s you sleep well.

5030 2018-11-02 00:01:06 Absolutely agree. I've been loading on margin during market stumbles and do so at nearly no other time. I trade on my strengths because I am confident in the outcome. Bias on charts is evident in falling stocks on HC. Skin in the game can make you see things that aren't there.
