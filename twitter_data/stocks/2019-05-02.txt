Everyone: 

Commentators: "YOOO WE'RE GOING BACK TO SMASH 4!!"
3 2019-05-02 23:57:48 Did KFC stocks drop today????
4 2019-05-02 23:56:20 I understand we have the right to any religion we wish. Guaranteed by the constitution. Short of human and animal abuse and sacrifice. I also thought the pilgrims came because of all the laid back religious rules. No stocks or whipping
5 2019-05-02 23:56:15 I should have know ARK were just perma bulltards. They're yolo all in on tech stocks.
6 2019-05-02 23:55:58 Lowkey the past two years have been the worst time to be in school. I missed out on a lot of the bull run. I'm returning with a vengeance in a few months. #stocks #investing
7 2019-05-02 23:55:21 Yesterday - Industry: #SOFTWARE & SERVICES was 15% Positive, with #NOT APPLIC 7% Positive. Stocks: $VEC was 18% Positive, with $SPX 9% Positive. #ASX
8 2019-05-02 23:54:25 Even hot stocks that have been going straight up forever that seem impervious to anything will dump when whales takes profit as in the case of $TWLO. They'll crush longs on the wave down. Now it's jus whose the next fool i can sell bs to. Pyramid scheme of what'll be bag holders.
9 2019-05-02 23:53:00 I don’t. I desire Elon musk to be put into the village stocks and pelted with rotten fruit. He seems to be holding a car company hostage right now, so it isn’t simple.
10 2019-05-02 23:52:25 Thinking about buying stocks in @BeyondMeat
11 2019-05-02 23:51:25 I guess  I'm wrong.  I still don't understand what the market was expecting.  Powell didn't do anything and commodities sold off hard and USD went up a little.  What am I missing?  Was the market really expecting a cut when stocks are at ATH?  Fed is backward looking.
12 2019-05-02 23:51:14 Value hurts. Like buying stocks during the market crash. Everybody wants to buy cheap only in hindsight.
13 2019-05-02 23:50:53 i really started investing in my self more (financially) and it’s starting to pay off now! now it’s time to put what i saved into some stocks. i’m making real moves in the background while y’all better moving. #IWontBeDownForever
14 2019-05-02 23:50:11 This pro-#crypto guy strongly agrees. Not only am I active with #Bitcoin among several I #HODL, but I have several quality junior gold stocks and keep some phyzz as that time of absolute collapse in the City of London is eventually going to arrive.
15 2019-05-02 23:48:39 I'm not sure about your definition of BS, but they've been around for more than a decade offering CFD trading for stocks, commodities, and Forex. They only recently launched their dedicated crypto exchange, but they definitely have the capital to maintain one.
16 2019-05-02 23:48:15 Yes agreed, but I rather think for consistency and avoiding relying on luck that missing a few bucks at the top is way safer. For example, currently the risk reward for US Stocks is dangerous to the point it’s not worth gambling.
17 2019-05-02 23:44:38 I have heard these types of boasting from new technology CEO's before and many times it hasn't worked out.  In some cases, the stocks even going so far as to zero and a delisting from the exchange.

But we hope it's different this time with Elon Musk.
