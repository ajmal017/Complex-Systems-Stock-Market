12 2018-07-03 23:57:40 hmm.. the reason oil and gas pipelines exist is BECAUSE you can pump them cheaply and easily, something you can't do with coal. You can always put oil on a tanker truck or river barge and it will still be better than coal .

89 2018-07-03 23:48:27 Check out Midas, Meineke, Pep Boys...places like that. Typical driving (local traffic, one or two "road trips" per year" needs the oil changed about every 5000-7500 miles. Unless you drive daily for work, you don't put as many daily miles on your car as you think.
90 2018-07-03 23:48:20 Here's part of one of your tweets: " I am asking that Saudi Arabia increase oil production, maybe up to  2,000,000 barrels, to make up the difference...Prices to high!"

130 2018-07-03 23:42:02 I loved going to FedSoc events when I lived in DC! They always had plenty of free food and booze. The causes I support don't usually have the money to put on a good spread. Conservative causes come with oil money, tobacco money, laundered money, etc. - tons of open bar funding!
131 2018-07-03 23:41:40 Ingesting can make some very ill. Be mindful everyone is unique. Coconut oil pulling helps remove toxins out from your body and so much more but doesn’t risk ingesting the toxins. 10-20mins swishing in mouth, on an empty stomach. Spit out. Rinse with salt water. Brush well.
132 2018-07-03 23:41:18 I’m a big user of oil for my face and body, into which I drop some essential oil. Not loving the almond oil I bought though, it makes me smell nutty lol

135 2018-07-03 23:41:11 368 drilling licenses have been issued in Grande Prairie in 2018, a 36% increase over 2017. Of the licenses issued to date, 161 were for oil, 188 for gas and 19 for other industry related wells, compared to 103, 145 and 23 respectively last year. That's impressive. #gpab

152 2018-07-03 23:37:10 Was at a Chris Knight show. From the first song dude was hollering at him to play a song all the way to the end. All Chris would do was smile and just say “I don’t know it.” And this was like “Oil Patch Town”, you know one of those songs that he knew by heart. Still a great show.
153 2018-07-03 23:36:55 Your skin produces oil where you need the most moisture so up the moisturizer on your nose and it should improve 
154 2018-07-03 23:36:52 We call it castor oil in the uk

156 2018-07-03 23:36:43 The oil & gas industry is devastating my community & fracking is poisoning fellow Pennsylvanians and friends. Anthropogenic climate disruption aka climate change is real. Our govt needs to #wakeup.

159 2018-07-03 23:36:04 No, there were eight - here they are:
2009 4Q (+3.9%), 2010 2Q (+3.9%), 2011 4Q (+4.6%), 2013 Q3 (+3.1%), 2013 Q4 (+4.0%), 2014 Q2 (+4.6%), 2014 Q3 (+5.2%), and 2015 Q1 (3.2%).
160 2018-07-03 23:36:03 I think we misunderstood each other. The scent elements used to make a candle are NOT the same essential oils. They vaporize at different points. If you just pour essential oil and wax into a candlemaker, you get burnt oil. That's what I was trying to say.
161 2018-07-03 23:35:59 hahaha oo meron castor oil.
162 2018-07-03 23:35:51 I picture those Dawn commercials to end with the washed duck just walking into another puddle of oil
163 2018-07-03 23:35:50 The best way to protect the water IMO is to develop a business plan that can provide the financial benefits of selling oil without the environmental dangers. 
To beat the system, you need to play within the system.

165 2018-07-03 23:35:18 Yes. I agree. I’m pointing out the “no socialism” crowd are for it when it comes to farm and oil subsidies.
166 2018-07-03 23:35:14 Yes of course, sort out the life threaten illnesses first.  I'm not disputing that.  I just  hope that does not turn into single or duo molecules pills for most people.  Whole plant entourage effect is best for all.  Eating it is very  beneficial!  Oil, balm n Vaping.  No pills!

171 2018-07-03 23:34:45 Oh good grief, another idiotic group of elitists. I sincerely hope the petroleum companies stop selling fuel of any kind to these states. That means diesel, gasoline, jet fuel, heating oil.  See how long these states / localities survive!
172 2018-07-03 23:34:44 Remember all those who put their lives on the line and sacrifices unknowingly to be fooled by politicians to enable US oil companies take oil from other countries in the name of spreading democracy, WMD, regime change

178 2018-07-03 23:32:13 We can't export those alternatives yet. We can export oil, and infuse the province with cash.

Fuckin hypocrite hippy fucker

184 2018-07-03 23:31:32 Kind of sad that everybody is blaming the economic collapse of Venezuela on "socialism". The Rothschild deep state took them down, for the same reasons they took down Libya: steal their oil, minerals, save petrodollar, install central bank. Murder by deep state, then blame them.

186 2018-07-03 23:31:16 I remember in elementary school reading my Weekly Reader and it projecting by the year 2000 there will be no water to drink we would all have to be wearing gas masks because the air would be unbreathable we would run out of oil and a host of other doom-and-gloom predictions

188 2018-07-03 23:31:15 I hate it when a recipe suggests some bougie brand of a basic ingredient. Or worse, just calls for, like, “good olive oil.” What’s “good,” bitch? I’m using this Costco-size bottle of Pompeian olive oil and the pasta salad’s gonna turn out juuuust fine.

214 2018-07-03 23:27:55 After I wash in twists, I then add deep conditioner and oil to all the sections , I sit under a hooded dryer cap for 30 mins then I rinse it out.After that I take out all of the twists and my deep conditioner is so moisturizing I don’t need a leave in. I just add olive oil on top

we are in dire need of Mountain Dew and patriotic tee shirts. The boys are tired and thirsty, the smell of tiki oil is insufferable. I miss the cool dampness of our basement and fear that i won’t make it back home to my Xbox, Doritos and fireworks #secondcivilwarletters

232 2018-07-03 23:25:53 On my wash day I section my hair, detangle first with hot water and coconut oil, I finger detangle as much as possible then go in and use the comb to get extra shed hairs out. I then put a bunch of chunky twists in my hair and wash my hair in the twists

234 2018-07-03 23:25:48 So I’ve been having car trouble and I took my car to Heath Oil. I had to go to work so my mom brought me and when they finished they drove my car and dropped it off at the store. I love seeing Godly people doing kind things. 10/10 would recommend.
235 2018-07-03 23:25:43 @ThinkmoneySleepmoney yes... because when oil was horrible it hurt their business. The oil recovery plus good management = huge turn around

260 2018-07-03 23:21:10 Liquid bovine. I love that term. You certainly can but all our research showed the diners in the Lonestar State used mostly a corn oil. Now, when you get into the South, they used mostly lard or tallow (as my grandmother did). Always a big tub on the kitchen counter.

277 2018-07-03 23:18:34 VP= Vile Partisan. Like you. Oil spills will have a better legacy than you.
278 2018-07-03 23:18:33 Moira, we're so sorry to hear about your husband's experience after receiving his first oil change. Thank you for updating us on the situation. Just so we have it noted, which Honda dealer was he working with? ^FC
279 2018-07-03 23:18:29 omg Janay I don't like bobos either!! I think it might be the oil they use that makes it taste "off"
280 2018-07-03 23:18:11 If oil is made from decomposed dinosaurs, and plastic is made from oil - plastic dinosaurs are made from real dinosaurs.

284 2018-07-03 23:17:42 I think my car is leaking oil someone mansplain what i need 2 to
285 2018-07-03 23:17:35 In case y’all wanted to know what a shekel looked like. Oh and I see how those oil lamps
Could run out of oil so fast.
286 2018-07-03 23:17:33 Baby oil
287 2018-07-03 23:16:53 And that is also a sad statement. Why aren’t we shipping oil?  Oh yeah, Trudeau and Notley are “building” a pipeline.

289 2018-07-03 23:16:45 Dear Ma, 
Once explosions stopped and smoke cleared I could see the carnage. Car after car spewed steam, gas, oil. The battle of Talladega was over. Libs had won by scattering jacks on the course. MAGAts were no match for pissed off toddlers.
Love, dbciii

290 2018-07-03 23:16:42 No type of government works if there is corruption in the system. Let me repeat NO TYPE OF GOVERNMENT WORKS IF THERE IS CORRUPTION. Venezuela is very corrupted ranking in the top ten. They’re high dependency in oil led to their downfall. I hope you comprehend.
291 2018-07-03 23:16:20 Yk your getting old when you get excited about getting an oil change lol
292 2018-07-03 23:16:18 Aumenta el #Petroleo y en todo el mundo aumentan los combustibles. En #Uruguay se congelan precios del gas oil y el gas doméstico...
¡Vamos por más!
293 2018-07-03 23:16:14 WOW That's a new low - not heard of it before. A pattern is emerging - of masking symptoms of unappealing women's problems with snake oil.
294 2018-07-03 23:16:03 Would probably be less messy to clean up than oil!!
295 2018-07-03 23:15:36 Check your Engine oil this Sunday.
296 2018-07-03 23:15:18 The only thing that hasn't happened yet is oil is staying up there, for real global PMI hits I need to see oil break under $59, after that we should see a inversion, this is why I use the August 31, and on time-lime
297 2018-07-03 23:15:10 @AcneSkinSite Hi! Is it okay to use both Cetaphil Facial Cleanser then Tea Tree Oil Facial Wash after?
298 2018-07-03 23:15:10 RT @LivingSafely: Big #Mac this July? The first three #ingredients in the Special Sauce are oil, pickles, High Fructose Corn Syrup.
299 2018-07-03 23:14:59 Know it was coming, they've got to do something to try to make POTUS look bad. It's too bad he's called for SA to export more oil to bring the price down..
300 2018-07-03 23:14:57 Best thing to do if you don't have a cold potato is put ice on it, to stop the cooking of the skin. Lavender essential oil ONLY after the burning stops, helps heal and disinfects. Keep it clean, sweat this time of year makes it harder to heal
301 2018-07-03 23:14:52 Pal. The oil price scuppered the plan . Move on
302 2018-07-03 23:14:47 I recreated this on my college dorm room wall mural size. I’m sure the oil pastels are still bleeding through the paint 40 years later!
303 2018-07-03 23:14:46 Oh, I didn't think about the "smoke" part - nevermind. I'm mostly oil pen based now that I moved to BK anyway.
304 2018-07-03 23:14:21 Agreed
If people want -real- 

Personal responsibility: end tax breaks for the ridiculously rich
Job creators: end tax breaks to obscenely profitable businesses (e.g.#Amazon, oil industry)

The myth of the superiority of the rich is a Wizard of Oz trick paid for by everyone else

321 2018-07-03 23:10:42 Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly Oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off buildings. Obstructing Canada’s Gay friendly oil/Gas = killing

328 2018-07-03 23:10:14 WOAH! I have the same problem. My eye doctor gave me this eye mask that I have to wear for at least 10 minutes every night to open up my glands and recommended this fish oil for dry eyes. Been on doing this for a couple of months now and so far so good. Granted, I miss days lol.

331 2018-07-03 23:09:48 in Russia dal 2001 ad oggi i poveri sono diminuiti da 40 a 20 milioni ma ciò è derivante in stragrande maggioranza all' andamento del prezzo oil che passo da 23 dollari a 140 del 2008.  Tra il 2010  fino al 2014 tra i 70 e 110. Nel 2015  entrò recessione perché andò a 26 dollari

342 2018-07-03 23:08:52 One egg, one cup oil, teaspoon of mustard and teaspoon of lemon juice. S&P as desired.  Stick blender, start with a couple bursts, then continue until completely emulsified.  Takes only a minute! 
343 2018-07-03 23:08:44 What part of Texas? Are there options? I'm thinking "oil field" and "feed lot" aren't for me, but I'd be willing to give "gulf breeze" or "fresh aloe" a shot.

348 2018-07-03 23:08:05 saying that “gasolina, Pele’s nickname in youth (?) is the portuguese word for crude oil” in an article about racism in Brazil is the kind of biased bullshit that can not fool even the most ignorant yankee reader

353 2018-07-03 23:06:45 Indeed. I re-watched the 2002 DVD for this and started to crave a decent blu Ray bout halfway through... Those oil derricks on blue ray would look majestical.

359 2018-07-03 23:06:02 Bullshit! Studies have shown it would cost up to 700 million a year- they will sell it off to oil and gas companies and ruin it. No one can run a private Zion National park and preserve it.

368 2018-07-03 23:04:51 I am a scientist. 100% renewables would mean that air travel would cease to exist because there is no such thing as renewable jet fuel. In addition, there is no economical alternative to oil and gas for heating buildings in cold climates.
369 2018-07-03 23:04:50 Since they're red, it means they're new and you have a chance to get rid of them. Idk any specific product but search for one to use among natural solutions (such as aloe vera and almond oil), creams and elasticizing oils. Also, drink a lot of water and exercise

2. Get EPA, etc. grants, or sue & settle with EPA, or start a wind / solar scam.
3. Profit! (and re-donate to Dems and their front groups to dodge limits)

390 2018-07-03 23:02:15 Oil is too good for them and strangely erotic. Let’s put Russian mattresses soaked with shlyukha urine in the bouncy houses.
391 2018-07-03 23:02:05 He probably already has! God knows the oil companies and Monsanto bend him over on a daily basis. He’s just taking it out on the eagle.
392 2018-07-03 23:01:50 Looking forward to reading about this in the next books of the snake oil merchants who told us to get up early, eat less sugar and educated us about 'masculine and feminine energy'. Always an inspiration.

402 2018-07-03 23:00:49 Remittances from USA is Mexico's Top income source, over and above their crude oil production.

Let that sink in.
403 2018-07-03 23:00:44 It's basically just a bit of powder you put in your hair to absorb any excess oil from the roots, & then you shake it out. It's great for people with fragile hair that can't be washed every day. Did I mention that I have fragile hair that can't be washed every day? I do.

Mom: Where are you going with that?
Dad: I'm giving it to the turtle.
Mom: Don't!
Dad: Why?
Mom: First, he hasn't been eating it lately, and second, it has olive oil in it.
Dad: He's part Italian!
414 2018-07-03 22:59:16 And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.

420 2018-07-03 22:58:15 Are you bringing enough tostones for 32 million or do I need to oil up my trusty tostonera and need to notify @nuevopionero to get busy in his kitchen too?  Who’s making the tRump piñata?
421 2018-07-03 22:58:11 Yup. Butter, half & half, garlic, parmesan cheese, a touch of olive oil, crab meat, and fettuccini noodles.
422 2018-07-03 22:58:03 Plugs in G-pen battery to charges cause I got this cartridge coming my way, dat way, the hash oil way, the THC concentrate way.
423 2018-07-03 22:57:34 I was just telling another buddy of mine how this kind of nonsense from ScarJo is souring me on Black Widow the same way Gwenyth Paltrow's new age snake oil routine left a bad taste in my mouth regarding Pepper Potts. Which is kind of a bummer but oh well.
424 2018-07-03 22:57:14 Am I the only one who looks for the bottles of healing oil in her house when the recipe calls for Olive Oil

426 2018-07-03 22:56:56 They are very effective in spreading stupid lies and hate speeches but they're deaf and dumb on all  achievements recorded so far with ever lowest crude oil price $39 far barrel. Thunder from Hell fire will destroy your phone screen soon. PVC's dusted already no way for looters.

428 2018-07-03 22:56:42 I’ve checked and it’s all good. Over the counter cod liver oil is good for you.
429 2018-07-03 22:56:40 Tea and amaTennis biscuits the best burning the midnight oil snack
430 2018-07-03 22:56:31 The oil tycoons will try to stop that from happening. They don’t care about environment, they worry about wallets.

433 2018-07-03 22:55:27 At this point I need my hair done, nails done, feet done, ass done, pussy ate, a blunt, a new wardrobe, facial scrub, back massage.. Lord just exfoliate my life and cover it in coconut oil.
434 2018-07-03 22:55:17 Chi parla di economia Russia in un determinato periodo e non lo relazione con l andamento del prezzo petrolifico in quel   periodo vuol dire che deve rivedere le basi della sua (im)preparazione economica. la Russia è il primo produttore mondiale di oil.

435 2018-07-03 22:55:17 Coconut oil!
436 2018-07-03 22:55:13 in the same way that Gwyneth Paltrow being a loopy snake oil salesman peddling fake new age remedies for way too much money cast a pall on the character of Pepper Potts for me, so Scarlett Johansson is slowly souring me for Black Widow.
437 2018-07-03 22:55:13 Bravo Mr. President Trump. The entrepreneurial  mind in you could save the world from sturbon oil prices. Moreso handle the reckless "strenthening" of the US dollar. It's killing the global economies & it will come back to you. Am sure US isn't galvanised to handle after effects.
438 2018-07-03 22:54:07 Smart cars have gone too far...

I turn the car on, adjust the A/C and hear:

"DING! Fuel low DING! Oil low"

I sigh, open my wallet, see $5.

"DING! Money low"

Seriously? Stop judging me car!  I slump forward on the steering wheel.

"DING! Self-esteem low"

441 2018-07-03 22:53:50 I think you are correct. Best Foods doesn't seem the same either and it also seems to get "funky" faster (cheaper oil?) than it used to!
442 2018-07-03 22:53:41 Yess! Especially if you add some tea tree oil to it.
443 2018-07-03 22:53:30 Heard: "Mom, an eagle dropped a half-eaten salmon in the yard and the dog is rolling around in the fish oil." #JuneauTweets
444 2018-07-03 22:53:27 @ABC Nightly News covers record heat wave and wild fires. But can't seem to mention the connection with climate change. Are you afraid of Trump or maybe losing oil company ad revenue?
445 2018-07-03 22:53:22 You prolly need oil

449 2018-07-03 22:52:09 Dear Mom,
We captured the Chick-fil-A that the MAGAs were using as an outpost, but as they use peanut oil I must go on search of food. Hoping to find a good Mexican restaurant to hold up in for the night.

#secondcivilwarletters
450 2018-07-03 22:52:05 but it does look fancy though especially the way I use and mix it all together. And yes I do use extra virgin olive oil :)
451 2018-07-03 22:51:54 So when do we take the oil, get Mexico to pay for the wall, and get tired of winning? Thought it should’ve happened by now...
452 2018-07-03 22:51:42 2. It doesn't bode well for that strategy if they start declassifying 20% of existing national parks to potentially start exploring for oil, which is likely to lead to direct deforestation

458 2018-07-03 22:50:16 In oil and gas, doesnt seem like it. Haha. It’s a professional where you can get a lot of money but a little time. More money you make, less time you’ll get. Maybe i might gonna try different industry. Hahaha
459 2018-07-03 22:49:46 bitch castor oil ! not that shit
460 2018-07-03 22:49:45 Bought a moisturiser specifically for it's 'none greasy' tag line. Might aswell have bathed in olive oil.
461 2018-07-03 22:49:43 "So I got this oil change in 1978 and it was bad so I want you to warranty it off and do it for the price I had it in 1982 also I have a coupon"

463 2018-07-03 22:49:40 Plantains oil
464 2018-07-03 22:49:35 I don’t get it. US is now self-suffient in oil and gas thanks to fracking. Why does he want the Saudis to bring the price down?? I suppose to squeeze Iran and Venezuela even more. By the way 3 out of 4 of Trumps’ last messages include grammar mistakes. (OMG)
465 2018-07-03 22:49:29 And Trump filled his cabinet with Goldman Sachs alumns, oil execs, lobbyists and corrupt billionaires #draintheswamp
466 2018-07-03 22:49:21 I'll have to try it ! I'm using rosehip oil I heard it was really good, its gotten a lot better but still  thanks girl !
467 2018-07-03 22:49:19 i use baby oil lol
468 2018-07-03 22:49:18 Trump and Russia could take control of Canada, it’s fresh water, oil & mineral resources and access to the Arctic & NW passage. Don’t honk it’s possible? Canadians speak english with american accents like Ukrainians & Crimean’s speak Russian. Why not?
469 2018-07-03 22:49:10 Do you match your bases? Like water bases primer with water based foundation? Oil, silicon, ect. I find that really helps

Indigenous rights, clean water, a safe climate. What's your reason to stand with these climber…
472 2018-07-03 22:49:05 It did for me but I also has some essential oil that I put on it to to clean the wound because I didn't have a first aid kit on me that day
473 2018-07-03 22:49:05 There's also one with hazelnut and lime oil, and one with this really super soft and fluffy caramel inside. Ahhh laura is hungry again LOL XD
474 2018-07-03 22:48:58 Essential peppermint oil makes ants go away. They can’t stand the smell. Couple of drops around their path and they won’t come back. Or you can mix it with water and a spray bottle and spray it everywhere

481 2018-07-03 22:47:26 currently on PineTrust looking for motor oil recipes.
482 2018-07-03 22:47:25 1) When it comes to additional production, Arab states and Russia would cover the market; even when the USA will impose sanction on Iran's oil & gas sector. Don't worry about this part. Some other events would highly likely happen & destabilize the global energy market; if many
483 2018-07-03 22:46:56 Who won't buy Iran oil at a discount to mkt?
484 2018-07-03 22:46:54 Please do! I got an air fryer and have been making wings in that with little oil. These look like they would be perfect for that.
485 2018-07-03 22:46:53 Well as you ask John, Beijing and Guangzhou are first tier cities of the world’s most dynamic economy, Singapore is a member of ASEAN, the largest trading block in Asia, Baku, Baghdad and Qatar have oil reserves that will last another 200+ years 1/
486 2018-07-03 22:46:47 Steal cable and oil at the same time, how possible out s that??????
487 2018-07-03 22:46:33 Can show how dirty the oil business really is.

498 2018-07-03 22:45:37 I have the problem lots in the summer and I honestly feel like my urban decay all nighter spray helps everything just lay down and stick. I usually use the oil slick because I have combination skin but both work great for meeeeee
499 2018-07-03 22:45:35 Will Oil Prices Fall before the Midterm elections?
500 2018-07-03 22:45:26 Nope I believe the planet can take it. All the recycling BS is just that. Going green is stupid.  Drill for oil natural gas save money.
501 2018-07-03 22:45:25 Prices will get a lot lower and the outflow of money to them will disappear if we can get the three biggest discoveries of oil in this country into production. Billions lost to the Saudis and the middle east
502 2018-07-03 22:45:12 I used coffee cream, you can use whatever milk. I’ve heard coconut milk has great benefits for the skin, you can also add some drops of lavander essential oil. Look for tutorials on YouTube, they’re great and help you A LOT!

515 2018-07-03 22:43:06 Connor Brown is a really good, Arvind scrappy kid with heart. He scores goals and kills penalties. I’m sure Dubas would do Chiarelli the solid of trading him to the oil for that stunted prospect, Pulujarvi. (Please?)
516 2018-07-03 22:43:02 Is there a stove leveling service? Asking for a... fuck it. For me. I want my pans to sit level so I don't have oil down on one side all the damned time.

526 2018-07-03 22:41:29 Or maybe he should just block traffic on the bridge so people stop consuming oil. Either one I would be happy with
527 2018-07-03 22:41:13 Cannibalism!? Come on @japantimes I'm sure you have something to back up these claims. You're better than this! Instead of putting focus  on the Congolese people why talk about the Soco oil company and the ties between the Congolese "government" and BP.

531 2018-07-03 22:40:30 First time since the '70's when OPEC countries realized they could effect Americans directly with oil prices, that Americans, now enjoying an America, (thanks to @POTUS), as a net exporter, can return the favor from pain we've suffered economically since.

552 2018-07-03 22:37:28 Rouhani in response to Trump's aim to halt Iran oil exports: "Cutting Iran's exports means cutting the oil exports of entire region. Naturally (Trump) doesn't understand what he's saying. Do that if you can to see its consequences!"

561 2018-07-03 22:34:47 I can’t date a guy that prefers to buy a lift kit over paying for a brake and oil change. Some of y’all really be living to impress everyone else. Priorities man, think long run.

Oh did you hear how Putin Or Russia, are benefiting from the 75 dollars increase, with the decrease of Iranian Oil as an factor. How about Tariffs on ALL foreign oil? Yeah When pigs fly. Both Trump and Putin for that profile

564 2018-07-03 22:34:28 I am James Marsden in Strawdog. I'll let some shit slide, but when push comes to shove I'm throwing boiling oil on your face and shooting your foot with your own shotgun. All to protect my very principled wife even when I think she needs to chill her ass out.

571 2018-07-03 22:33:54 Because this is not about oil shipments it is about Alberta oil shipments these fools are duped into believing the religion of Climate Change.

581 2018-07-03 22:32:55 a guy asked aaron if his truck is burning oil. aaron said no it’s fuel and he said it’s like cutting it with a knife as we was doing the swimming impression

584 2018-07-03 22:32:15 Phones that are made by an industry using electricity, still supplied by coal. Its the same argument if we say oil wells are bad for the environment, so stop driving your car. I want change.I dont want government telling me my car is illegal to operate because now we have options
585 2018-07-03 22:31:54 Brothers if you wanna keep your lady don’t be basic. Learn how to fix the pipes, AC, change her oil. My girl gone be cheating on me with me cause I do it all .
586 2018-07-03 22:31:50 The key phrase there is "tanker safety". This is a political exercise against Alberta oil and the environuts could  care less about safety
587 2018-07-03 22:31:46 Nice quoting of Thatcher there, considering she doubled unemployment and poverty during an oil boom. She must be a great authority in defining appropriate economic actions!
588 2018-07-03 22:31:44 Drinking hot oil like a deconstructed turkey.

590 2018-07-03 22:31:40 What 10 year old needs to know how to change a tire or their own oil LMAO
591 2018-07-03 22:31:37 But they are hoping to decimate our oil sector as well, this would be a win win for them. Not so much for the tens of thousands of people who would lose their jobs.
592 2018-07-03 22:31:21 He's only not in a lot of that trouble because for most of the time he was getting into it he didn't need to think about anyone ever scrutinising his activities. He's like a snake oil salesman off Deadwood.
593 2018-07-03 22:31:11 @lallimusic after suggesting to husband we start buying *nicer* olive oil he broke out in hives and said, “won’t make a difference.” Help!

607 2018-07-03 22:28:56 ..... yep ... the gas prices is too low and our buddies in the oil industry has suffered low  profits too long... got to do something to push up prices....
608 2018-07-03 22:28:52 Watch for gas gouging now as oil is above $75.00 a barrel so we’ll more then likely see gas go as high as 150 or 160 a litre for sometime and maybe go higher. Cross fingers and toes
609 2018-07-03 22:28:45 Putin wants the Exxon oil deal that Obama quashed. Trump wants to give it to him. Trump doesn’t want anything because he already got it with $ and the election, and Putin is calling the shots.

627 2018-07-03 22:26:12 All due to the ongoing war in the middle East that was started based on a false flag and the desire to secure oil fields. We can thank war criminal Bush for that one. Without that obligation, those problems would never have happened.

629 2018-07-03 22:26:09 I’ve got my hair cut short for the hot summer here in the south USA. If you do cut it, when you grow it out the undercoat and top coat will grow back at the same length making it poofy, but thinning shears and oil baths at the groomers help with that

Info on transfer of Russian oil money, however is a matter that matters. Assurance Putin can swing another election also good to hear. Deciding how to communicate (use THIS)...vital to success.

684 2018-07-03 22:19:04 If cashews or other nuts also include peanut oil in ingredient list, ok or pass?
685 2018-07-03 22:19:02 ヤバ진짜?진짜?

686 2018-07-03 22:18:49 me watching #QueerEye - waaaait can i use this pre-shave oil on my legs?!? seriously there needs to be  one of these shows for femme people b/c I've always been bad at all that grooming stuff tbh.
687 2018-07-03 22:18:44 Oil? Gas?
688 2018-07-03 22:18:28 i started smelling olive oil and legit thought it was me...
689 2018-07-03 22:18:04 My all time fav oil!
690 2018-07-03 22:18:02 This was not a Trump administration created problem. It was an Obama era created problem. Subsidizing healthcare was not, and is not "free" but Dems sold us that snake oil.
691 2018-07-03 22:18:00 What can you do with lemon oil???
692 2018-07-03 22:17:57 "My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment." ~Luke 7:46 #Jesus #God #Bible
693 2018-07-03 22:17:57 None of those guys has really hit it out of the park either. Bad draft class. Poor development on both Yak and Oil. Let's move on.
694 2018-07-03 22:17:54 Time for an oil change. 
695 2018-07-03 22:17:53 this man is actively working for big oil and coal. He is actively hiding what he is doing from the public. He is a stain on America and his actions have real-world effects on the planet.
Fuck civility. He should be shunned and shamed for what he is proudly doing.
696 2018-07-03 22:17:51 Could you imagine how much money America would spend on space exploration if we found one oil reserve on Mars?
697 2018-07-03 22:17:50 First EPA head to have a trophy of coal over his mantle and bathe in crude oil and toxic waste each evening.
698 2018-07-03 22:17:48 Did you take him north to the #Gwichin land of #ANWR & show him the culture you are about to destroy for oil? #PorcupineCaribouHerd #SacredLand
699 2018-07-03 22:17:23 To the rest of the world, the U.K. was useful as a doorway to the largest market on the world.  After Brexit, we are a bunch of islands stuck out in the North Atlantic with no connectivity to key markets, depleted oil reserves, plummeting productivity and growing inflation.
700 2018-07-03 22:17:20 We’re owned by oil companies
701 2018-07-03 22:17:10 Lack of hair cuts and loads of coconut oil masks 
702 2018-07-03 22:17:09 Alaska's oil dividend isn't exactly a UBI but ok...
look at what?
703 2018-07-03 22:17:08 Full EV (not hybrid) sales depend largely on subsidies, taxes, and regulations. The price of batteries may eventually become a bottleneck. On the other hand oil prices will probably rise because exploration gives poor results.
704 2018-07-03 22:17:07 I think it is safe to say that if you are calling around looking for a cheaper oil change on your #Maserati that perhaps you should rethink your automobile choice.
705 2018-07-03 22:17:04 As a child, Scott Pruitt felt rejected by the big oil spill in his life. This has manifested into a serious complex where as an adult man, he now obsessively seeks the approval of every oil spill he meets.
706 2018-07-03 22:16:36 Following the US sanctions to Venezuela, Washington now imports more than 50% of its Canadian oil needs, thanks to the notorious Keystone pipeline that transports heavy Canadian oil from Alberta tar sands to US refineries in Texas and Illinois.
707 2018-07-03 22:16:33 I’m new to this Afro thing, so I don’t wanna be telling you the wrong stuff. But my weekly routine
Water + coconut oil
Hair mayonnaise 
ORS conditioner, 
Braids for at least a month, always plait your hair every night(if it’s long enough)
Results are visible in 1-2months
708 2018-07-03 22:16:15 There are people elsewhere in the world who burn dung for cooking and heat because thy don't have oil and the luxuries you have. 

Elizabeth has enough oil for herself and doesn't think anyone else deserves any.
709 2018-07-03 22:16:11 This the start of month oil change?
710 2018-07-03 22:16:07 Not just oil rich....the richest!
711 2018-07-03 22:15:29 I swear to god legalize weed and bring me weed infused olive oil fucking intellectual peasants
712 2018-07-03 22:15:24 I think today's stunt is about Green Peace earning their pay and keeping commitments to foreigners to land lock Canadian oil and gas.  Our O&G is discounted.  All Canadians lose.
713 2018-07-03 22:15:24 Deep conditioning my hair with coconut oil for the first time in ages

715 2018-07-03 22:15:22 Forgot how long oil paint takes to dry up and this painting is needed by tomorrow 
716 2018-07-03 22:15:20 Nothing has changed...on the Republican/Trump agenda. They are doing exactly as they set out to do. When do Democrats start addressing it for what it really is? it’s an assault on Western Democracy to change the world order & lift sanctions - all for oil, money power & greed.
717 2018-07-03 22:15:13 I need an oil change
718 2018-07-03 22:15:12 Most see what they expect to see. The cool thing about judging motives is that its mostly trivial to see, and people are practically guaranteed to act on their motives.  Shorters are not the only ones with negative motives. ICE manufacturers, oil companies.
719 2018-07-03 22:15:10 
720 2018-07-03 22:14:53 The thing Mike won't mention is that the alternative to the pipeline is other tankers from less well-regulated jurisdictions and oil-by-rail which is more dangerous to marine and freshwater resources. His campaign puts us at greater risk of spills and environmental damage #bcpoli
721 2018-07-03 22:14:48 @LeaZavatti Se acaban de comunicar desde Sybilla Producciones para informate que debido a la pisada de Midnight Oil, este mes no solo no percibirás tu aguinaldo, sino que además serás multado con $2.500.- y una semana presentando Indie del interior y cumbia villera.
722 2018-07-03 22:14:37 Dearest Love,
Tomorrow we set out for Fort 
Mar-a-lago. According to google maps it’s 8.27 miles by foot. I pray my portable chargers last as we make our way by cellphone light. Word has spread their tiki torch oil supply is low. Amazon won’t deliver more.

731 2018-07-03 22:12:12 The incompetent Harper had nine years to build a pipeline through BC but failed miserably. Unlike Harper who cowered at the sight of protesters, Trudeau is a strong leader who will comfort the opposers and build a pipeline to free Alberta oil.
732 2018-07-03 22:12:11 Tip: Shower with baby oil. It doesn't only make your skin amazing but it helps slide down all the bs thrown your way 
733 2018-07-03 22:12:07 Yup, it's the oil& gas billonaires taking exuberant profits has been the #1 prob always, Now it will even happily double unde this DrugFord regime expect higher not lower gas price
734 2018-07-03 22:11:50 Tires? Rotated.
Oil? Changed.
Parental permission?

737 2018-07-03 22:11:24 Here's what we do know- EPA Admin Scott Pruitt secretly meets top oil, gas, chem execs while killing clean water/air regulations.
Oh, that's on top of 14 federal investigations for self dealing.
R u kidding me?! #DrainTheSwamp
738 2018-07-03 22:11:23 Why do some hemp oil companies use ethanol and glycerine in their CBD oils
739 2018-07-03 22:11:12 yeah it was .Me and sedge googling how to get oil and grease off a mattress

741 2018-07-03 22:11:04 @Rouhani_ir You can not protect the dome on your head and how you talk about disabling the oil shipments to neighboring countries 
742 2018-07-03 22:10:52 Support for the LVMH Fund is provided by The Big Oil Opportunity Fund, working tirelessly to store those who serve fish.
743 2018-07-03 22:10:48 On other not related news about the world coup, I love stealing oil from the beauty stand
744 2018-07-03 22:10:26 WRONG. Fry up some rapini, olive oil and garlic lil bitch.

746 2018-07-03 22:10:20 It is an oil painting, Jupiter is a wandering luminary in the waters of the firmament
747 2018-07-03 22:10:10 RT @LivingSafely: Big #Mac this July? The first three #ingredients in the Special Sauce are oil, pickles, High Fructose Corn Syrup.
748 2018-07-03 22:10:08 Pruitt stays because the donor class(oil lobby) owns the GOP and they are saving a fortune thanks to regulation rollbacks.  He acts with impunity because he has it.
749 2018-07-03 22:10:06 世界一サラダ油だと言ってくれ。
750 2018-07-03 22:09:37 I do *not* know anything about cars. "Oil-stick? oil doesn't stick?"
751 2018-07-03 22:09:29 @SenSchumer if Trump hasn't fired Pruitt with all the corruption there's a reason start following the money from gas & oil. The money stupid
752 2018-07-03 22:09:26 Cae sobre los q trabajamos pero el gas oil no pero igual van a subir todo
753 2018-07-03 22:09:25 my smash wishlist:

-buff lucas' dair 
-make oil panic even more fucked up
-all of geno
754 2018-07-03 22:09:12 the oil change analogy is correct!
755 2018-07-03 22:09:11 Just add low oil prices to the already high crime rate in Abuja and this is gonna be the real purge....the type of hunger that brings out the beast in men....
756 2018-07-03 22:09:10 Then they get mad if you push for real security instead of snake oil
757 2018-07-03 22:08:54 تصدق بالله ولله وصلت لمرحله خلاص كل الجواز مش ف بالي .. دلوقتي بدور ع شغل عشان انفع نفسي مفيش راجل هيقدر يصرف عليا غير بابا .. محدش يقدر يدلعني زي بابا طولت العمر والصحه ليه .. ومن بعده اكيد الشغل والفلوس بس 
758 2018-07-03 22:08:35 Leaking oil bro, almost to the point of descending into madness.
759 2018-07-03 22:08:30 Does the coconut oil have to be organic or just any coconut oil?
760 2018-07-03 22:08:29 What is happening in Nig Oil and Gas Resources is really an economist's nightmare. We are not properly harnessing the potentials of the subsector because of obvious reasons of maladministration & corruption. There must be a paradigm shift & total overall of the petroleum industry
761 2018-07-03 22:08:28 Crickey, Jesus Christ used cannabis oil to "make miracles"??? But I bet he got it from Mary Magdalene...
762 2018-07-03 22:08:14 But @Califlourfoods pizza crusts are the best out there. I make a pizza with them 1-2 times a week. Olive oil base.
763 2018-07-03 22:08:13 Dearest Papa and Daddy,
Your advice before battle was so wise. The humid rainy June, and the countrywide buyout of "Gun Oil" as personal lubricant, left the Deplorables with rusted firearms. Glory was ours! #SecondCivilWarLetters
764 2018-07-03 22:08:12 well until i can get stats on Rope's Snake and Oil Panic i think that was the most pressing issue for me!!!
765 2018-07-03 22:08:10 If pump prices go down, I’ll be surprised. If they stay down past the civic holiday, that’s because oil will have dropped.
766 2018-07-03 22:08:06 Naija Economy naw... They gat to Strategize ao to deregulate the oil sector too! Executives no dey do house meeting 
767 2018-07-03 22:07:53 the 5 RICHEST families in the country with the BACKING of foreign toymakers have been FIXING oil prices
768 2018-07-03 22:07:46 今回の限定文香髪型違うから引くべきだよね
769 2018-07-03 22:07:33 Good thing you diluted it. I see things that recommend putting essential oil straight on a baby’s skin and it’s like yikes please don’t do that
770 2018-07-03 22:07:31 Citronella oil is your friend. Stops the burgers cold.
771 2018-07-03 22:07:23 Covered head 2 toe in coconut oil trying to sort this bloody sun burn out in time for my engagement party 
772 2018-07-03 22:07:22 Beware the Law.  And the law of unintended consequences.  Canada has the safest, most environmentally sound oil regulations in the world, and so, by your illegal blockade, YOU are harming the environment by hurting Canadian oil.  Other dirty oil will take its place.  Shame on you
773 2018-07-03 22:07:12 I have tangerine essential oil. #attacked
774 2018-07-03 22:06:57 Behold, mentor, ministry, and the wisdom center,how good, how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity,praying for you. Mentor and the wisdom center,,it is like the precious oil upon the head, running down on the beard,for the Lord commanded the blessing, on you,
775 2018-07-03 22:06:47 Congratulations!  Your family has contributed to the death of millions of innocent civilians and our own through bogus attempts by our politicians who don't know shit about diplomacy and would rather use your boys to install dictators that serve our oil execs
776 2018-07-03 22:06:33 Coconut oil always helps fam
777 2018-07-03 22:06:13 انك تتعرف ع ناس جديده وتغامر وتصاحب وتعمل علاقات اجتماعية .. ومن هنا بتكون احلي علاقات .. وبعدين اصلا دي ممكن نستفاد من غيرنا كتير خبرات وثقافه ممكن شغل ممكن سفر للخارج كده يعني
778 2018-07-03 22:06:10 They paid me in 6 gallons of vegetable oil
779 2018-07-03 22:06:10 And every other oil blended you traitors...go block Alaskan tankers also or is that the good kind not done by indigenous people
780 2018-07-03 22:06:02 These green assholes, like Gerald Butts, are only paid to obstruct Canadian oil.
781 2018-07-03 22:06:01 I’m old enough (and @RandyEBarnett is too) to remember when Chevron was called Standard Oil of California.
782 2018-07-03 22:05:50 that fckin trump and his cozying up to russia and then replacing them as oil producer...wait, howis this good for russia???...
783 2018-07-03 22:05:43 Spraying oil for an evenly browned KeyRose roast???
784 2018-07-03 22:05:38 Why do some hemp oil companies use ethanol and glycerine in their CBD oils?

790 2018-07-03 22:04:38 Faber Castell Polychromos (oil based, works a bit differently from wax based pencils) or Caran D'ache Luminance if you want great quality wax based (but not icky waxy) pencils. Luminance are hella expensive though.
791 2018-07-03 22:04:30 You're dosing bears now mr. snake oil salesman?
It just never ends with you.
792 2018-07-03 22:03:59 misleading article as not all of the g7 countries have oil so comparing our subsidies to the oil sector against a country with no oil makes no sense. Another way the Green Party lies to suit their agenda, it’s like comparing our subsidies to banana growers against Costa Rica’s
793 2018-07-03 22:03:58 When I sprayed peppermint oil on my scalp I felt like I was in heaven
794 2018-07-03 22:03:46 Pretty ironic. His sweat is like oil. Both arw flammable.
795 2018-07-03 22:03:42 The numbers are clear. But my bet is that next year when we are testing $100 oil, Ford may regret their decision to shift out of cars.
796 2018-07-03 22:03:32 How stupid. Rebates on new low flush toilettes, window/door replacements, replacing old oil furnaces, solar roof panels, and so much more that gave JOBS to Ontarians are now GONE! Way to go OPC!Are we winning yet?
797 2018-07-03 22:03:26 I’m home this week forgot my hairspray got what I THOUGHT was hairspray from my mom’s room put a generous amount into my already straightened hair and it just starts looking wet/oily it’s a bottle of ARGAN OIL omg 
798 2018-07-03 22:03:24 Nonsense, does he need to call you to give anybody oil bloc? His cabals will hand out oil bocs and he will claim that he his unaware! That is the trick he uses!

809 2018-07-03 22:02:17 my poppy told me to take a shot of olive oil before drinking so i don’t get a hangover. 10/10 don’t recommend trying to take a shot of olive oil. :-)

828 2018-07-03 21:59:52 I accidentally didn’t wear any makeup today, and nobody told me I looked tired or stressed or however they usually say I look when that happens. I guess I’ll take that to mean that my fairly extensive skincare routine isn’t just a bunch of snake oil after all. 
829 2018-07-03 21:59:48 coconut oil as makeup remover; avoid powder at all costs
830 2018-07-03 21:59:43 That Oil Mogul, Hamm, is Pruitt's benefactor. Trump wouldn't dream of upsetting that much money.
831 2018-07-03 21:59:34 Sparkling oil?! What kind of meat are you eating? Unicorn Meat?
832 2018-07-03 21:59:28 Yes! Coconut oil for example can be a very nice lube and/or massage lubricant, BUT as an oil, it (and any other oil) is fundamentally incompatible with latex condoms!

People, love and enjoy lube, but do your research! You could do worse than to start with @Lexington_Feelz, here.
833 2018-07-03 21:59:22 i can only eat so much oil before i die
834 2018-07-03 21:59:14 White man tryna get smart and shit. I’m like look fam, I’m only here for the oil change. So you don’t even gotta explain shit else lol
835 2018-07-03 21:59:04 Put oil in it
836 2018-07-03 21:58:55 #Englands quarter-final will be 3pm on #Saturday. It's going to be #bakinghot. Get to the shop quick before a can of #Carling becomes more expensive than a #barrel of crude oil.
837 2018-07-03 21:58:49 Oil filtration valve needed to be replaced the dealership said that is what caused my car to stall and stop.

839 2018-07-03 21:58:42 Maybe that's what all my fake generals, pilots, oil rig workers and estate agents are. Spies
840 2018-07-03 21:58:24 Baby oil or gentle magic
841 2018-07-03 21:58:22 such as renewable energy, to open up a lot of new jobs that can support a family.  I know Obama was trying to move in that direction. Trump has too many friends in big oil to do what's needed.
842 2018-07-03 21:58:21 Like some camelina oil or something
843 2018-07-03 21:58:15 I really want to rub some Jamaican Black castor oil in Josh’s hair, because that sun is eating the life out of his hair!! 
844 2018-07-03 21:58:12 Right as the price of oil increases... so no one will see any reductions.
845 2018-07-03 21:58:04 I’m really only getting by with French fries and peppermint oil. Y’all don’t even know.
846 2018-07-03 21:58:00 The Russians will sort that out once oil prices go up
847 2018-07-03 21:57:58 3rd generation oil field worker! I understand!
848 2018-07-03 21:57:48 Yes it is interesting they try to cover up any spill that happens - Like the recent huge oil spill in Kamloops - first the said it was real small & easy to clean up - then days later we found it was huge and they were still working on trying to clean it up -
849 2018-07-03 21:57:47 Alex has his snake oil empire to protect and his competing products to push, so we can plainly see why he’d put his profits over the welfare of the people and the objective truth.
850 2018-07-03 21:57:34 Old man gave me a discount on my oil change and he felt the need to say “Don’t worry, I’m not trying to pick you up” and it just makes me sad that men can’t even be nice anymore without the threat of being accused of something
851 2018-07-03 21:57:33 England's quarter-final will be 3pm on Saturday. It's going to be baking hot. Get to the shop quick before a can of Carling becomes more expensive than a barrel of crude oil.
852 2018-07-03 21:57:14 troops arent necessary. any attack on iran will mean iran counters by sinking tankers in hormuz. how do you defend against this?

clogging hormuz will quadruple the world's oil price instantly
853 2018-07-03 21:57:12 I need my hair braided. So I can just get up, oil it, and go.
854 2018-07-03 21:57:04 home from work. about shower and do my face mask & this hot oil treatment on my hair
855 2018-07-03 21:56:48 Origins modern friction cleansing oil + first aid beauty moisturizer has helped my dry skin so much, especially in this crazy ass TX weather
856 2018-07-03 21:56:41 Time to get another 80 dollar oil change 
857 2018-07-03 21:56:38 And what are they "pouring" over your tweets? Maple syrup? Motor oil? Russian hooker urine? I mean, THIS TWEET! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! #PoreNotPour
858 2018-07-03 21:56:32 You're a Nitwit! You've never written a thing in your life. Every one of your "best selling books" was ghost written. Mistakes abound in your pathetic tweets. No one has to pour over your tweets to find them. 

The oil price is "to" high, says the President of the United States.
859 2018-07-03 21:56:28 The DHS? The NSA? Corporate welfare? Tax breaks? Illegal war? Oil subsidies? Bank bailouts? If we did even a few of these we'd probably become a first world country with small federal government for once.
860 2018-07-03 21:56:15 Nyhahahaha........gas,oil,gen,prod,chem?
861 2018-07-03 21:56:07 You tell them! And don't forget to mention Uranium One and Biden's sons interest in Ukrainian oil ... oh, sorry, wrong tweet. Lol.
862 2018-07-03 21:56:07 Why does that sound like an essential oil not an ice cream
863 2018-07-03 21:56:07 Marie Sharp’s original is my fave. Lao Gan Ma chili oil is classic, very versatile.
864 2018-07-03 21:56:03 My beloved,
We are hungry and hurting but determined. Have foraged hollow reeds because we cannot use plastic straws for our chocolate almond-milk. Your homemade bath bombs have kept our wounds clean and smelling of coconut oil, like you, my darling Anne #secondcivilwarletters
865 2018-07-03 21:56:03 I feel so accomplished today. I washed my car and got an oil change that I’ve been holding off on 
866 2018-07-03 21:56:01 Fuckin annoying when ppl come in here picky af when the shoes they walked in w look like they dropped oil on them and let them dry out in the sun. Just gtfo.
867 2018-07-03 21:55:50 I’d like to know if Libyan oil is traveling down the pristine waters of the St Lawerence where those precious  Narwhal Whales frolic?Seems not to be a concern anymore!Perhaps it’s the US pipeline that goes to Quebec?Again no problem there!
868 2018-07-03 21:55:48 Dearest Rupert:
Today I stumbled upon some enemy combatants. Their tiki torches had spread oil, aflame, across their white T-shirts. Our medics attempted to treat them for no fee but were hailed with cries of “Socialist Medicine!” I fear for the republic. #secondcivilwarletter
869 2018-07-03 21:55:45 lmao after that old quote, he deadass told Honolulu to go write oil rig Destiel fiction. And he made that "western romcom with Misha" crack as a leak about Tombstone, and was excited with fan reactions. Jensen isn't their big homophobic hero anymore. That's dead. It's done.
870 2018-07-03 21:55:42 Fucking numb nuts the lot of them, can’t wait till their oil runs out and we fuck them off for some small island 
871 2018-07-03 21:55:40 Dear Baba,
The Antifa has liberated our concentration camp for Muslims and Perceived Muslims.  A white woman with dreadlocks who smells vaguely of patchouli is tending my wounds.  However, I don’t think coconut oil is going to fix this.  
Love,
Your son
#SecondCivilWarLetters
872 2018-07-03 21:55:24 Yeah, well, your country is killing Yemeni civilians and not letting cholera medicine through to help them. Unfortunately our country is helping you guys out with that. Is it because our currency is backed by Saudi oil and so our military goes wherever your dictator tells it to?
873 2018-07-03 21:54:56 You need the tranquility quietnight  diffuser x
874 2018-07-03 21:54:56 “You got a little oil on your nose lemme wipe it off”

876 2018-07-03 21:54:41 EEA - still light years better than "no deal" (minus the oil)
877 2018-07-03 21:54:37 What’s wrong w him? Or is it like when you go in for an oil change and they find hella shit wrong?
878 2018-07-03 21:54:23 Uber driver was Russian navy chief submarine mechanic, speaks 5 languages, and supervised crews on oil rigs in Greenland. Made me think of the trained vets, doctors, lawyers etc who delivered pizza when I worked at Eagle Boys. Not much has changed. #underutilisedtalentpool
879 2018-07-03 21:54:14 Depends on where you're riding and how often you're riding. We ride those pedals almost daily and don't have that issue. If you pedals still function, a little oil on them wouldn't hurt.
880 2018-07-03 21:54:13 Hope you found time to watch the boys doing it for the UK (done us proud) let’s hope Uk oil & gas does us proud 
881 2018-07-03 21:54:06 Add nine pounds of olive oil and bring to a boil.
882 2018-07-03 21:54:05 And Obama was a god though he didn’t know Memorial Day was for Dead soldiers, or how to spell (Marine) Corp or how many states the US has, or Preching moronically to Americans to fill our tires with air instead of sourcing our own oil
883 2018-07-03 21:54:02 Wanna be my gf for a day ? My car dirty af  & I need an oil change 
884 2018-07-03 21:53:47 We just got some new *Romulan Grapefruit 1g THC Oil Cartridge - 710 KINGPEN - Hybrid*
885 2018-07-03 21:53:14 They should head over to Russia and Saudi Arabia and protest their oil practices too. I wonder if they’d be tolerated?

889 2018-07-03 21:52:58 Tbqh, we've been learning the OIL lesson since 1973.
890 2018-07-03 21:52:56 Mother,

Our privation as we marched against the coastal forces seemed at an end when we intercepted their supply train. Sadly, cook says he has no recipes calling for coconut oil and kale. I yearn for the Sunday suppers of my youth.

Your dutiful son.

891 2018-07-03 21:52:52 Me entering whole foods: okay in & out, i only need a few staple items, no unnecessary purchases
Me leaving whole foods: wow this is great, i didn't even know they made tangerine essential oil
892 2018-07-03 21:52:51 Got my lashes done, oil change for my car and recharged the ac cause it’s hot as BALLS out, now I’m getting my nails and toes did, ugh why can’t I be rich already.
893 2018-07-03 21:52:44 I’m a salt and oil kind of person 
894 2018-07-03 21:52:43 The price of oil is hot.
895 2018-07-03 21:52:33 Since Halliburton's 2014 effective take-over of Mexico's equanimous state-run oil company Pemex, almost every citizen has suffered.
896 2018-07-03 21:52:26 Ethel, our lamp oil is running low, and I pray that we have the strength to carry-on.
897 2018-07-03 21:52:14 Johnson’s Baby oil isn’t had at all - if it’s really that bad 
898 2018-07-03 21:52:00 A big man used to be one who owns a big house. Then, it progressed into who owns more residential estates and tallest skyscraper

Now it's High Court Judge!

The implication of being able to influence court decisions is bigger than any physical property or Oil Well. It's murder!
899 2018-07-03 21:51:53 Deforestation at its worse... this is the scrouge of many exctinction ... but where is the oil palm??
900 2018-07-03 21:51:48 Putting coconut oil in your hair is a game changer 
901 2018-07-03 21:51:45 With DJT begging for more oil WE have an issue on the way CRUDE going higher for sure, where it stops???? 100 not OUT OF THE QUESTION as the saying goes the "horse is out of the barn"

907 2018-07-03 21:50:57 This isn’t a protest. Peaceful & legal protest is a ian right. It is another stupid stunt coordinated do deliberately fly in the face of both safety and Canadian laws to so that Greenpeace can get publicity from yet another stunt, & keep their narrative  oil is evil.
908 2018-07-03 21:50:34 A pot of hot oil is my only fear in life lmao

913 2018-07-03 21:49:58 So I lifted the chainsaw over my head, and some gas/oil mix dripped on me. Took a shower, but I can still smell it. It's going to drive me mad.
914 2018-07-03 21:49:47 England's quarter-final will be 3pm on Saturday. It's going to be baking hot. Get to the shop quick before a can of Carling becomes more expensive than a barrel of crude oil.

919 2018-07-03 21:49:33 Probably the same as if the Oil and Gas prices go up!
920 2018-07-03 21:49:33 I need an oil change, wash and my car needs to be vacuumed out  where’s @DatJune when u need him 
921 2018-07-03 21:49:31 There's a Greek bean salad that uses dill. White beans, lemon, dill, a little bit of garlic, and *way too much* olive oil. 
922 2018-07-03 21:49:07 部屋とワイシャツとオイル
923 2018-07-03 21:48:34 True, we let anyone in, especially the thieving English. If we are broke(n) it's down to you lot. Funny though, every time we try and get free, you lot whine that we can't break up the Union. It's not like we have oil...oh wait.
924 2018-07-03 21:48:28 GP campaigned against Energy East, which would've practically eliminated the need for tankers of foreign oil to feed refineries in the the eastern 1/2 of Canada. Nothing is as consistent as zealots' inconsistencies.
925 2018-07-03 21:48:19 What #4thofJuly tradition (powered by oil and gas) is your favorite? 
926 2018-07-03 21:48:18 You're fully aware that this is the Bishop who blessed me with oil, about a year and a half ago?
927 2018-07-03 21:48:15 API report shows a draw, but less of a draw than last week. Oil production is ramping up and we just hit the peek of our season. Super overbought. Sounds bearish to me.   #OOTT
928 2018-07-03 21:48:13 Of course, I heard heating up the Argan oil is really good but I haven’t tried it yet! Dry hair is a struggle 
929 2018-07-03 21:48:09 Those are special interest groups. They are small and hardly have the funds that the Pharma,Oil or Gun lobby have. They are not big business nau. Haba my guy,  you no dey watch MSNBC? I said name a big business that is backing pro-marijuana laws
930 2018-07-03 21:48:07 Yeah so just after the OPEC? Agreement to put out a ton more oil our gas prices went down a smidge did everyone not get the price cut???
Don't get jelly not that much.

932 2018-07-03 21:47:54 the worst part about changing the oil in my miata is trying to figure out where tf the oil level is ON THIS DAMN METALLIC DIPSTICK. HFS WHERE TF IS THE DAMN OIL LEVEL SITTING AT
933 2018-07-03 21:47:39 We just got some new *King Louis OG 1g THC Oil Cartridge - 710 KINGPEN - Indica*
934 2018-07-03 21:47:33 and thank you for sharing  such a gorgeous oil - can't wait to try more of your range! x
935 2018-07-03 21:47:28 Oh SCL Airport, you little rascals you! Once again they bring an ask. Have they provided a business plan (as was asked of them years ago)? 
Also, why would econ dev determine refund? What about Shell? Imperial Oil? Lots that generate more $ than SCL Airport. #RichBoys #shpk
936 2018-07-03 21:47:26 See here is my problem...I grew up w/o technology until higschool, I learned how to be social, change my oil, air up a tire, dismount and mount a tire by the age of 10, so when you are stranded or need an oil change you do it yourself not click buttons and drink your starbucks

942 2018-07-03 21:46:40 maybe you should learn some manners. can't  stand rude and what's it your business.
943 2018-07-03 21:46:22 Wall heaters and Oil heaters have to be amongst the most useless innovations ever...
944 2018-07-03 21:46:07 Current conversion rate to Iranian Riyal Vs US Dollar is ﷼ 50000. Sectarian philosophy will destroy oil rich country, India has hugely invest recently to develop a port, now American sanction will ruin Iran. America's rivalry with Iran is not new, it's from Jimmy Carter's time.
945 2018-07-03 21:46:04 JHC, if you read more than five words. Koch's father made oil deals with Nazis to make his fortune. Fact. 
Nevermind. Some people wish to stay blind and angry.
946 2018-07-03 21:46:01 I’m so soft... I need to lather in coconut oil everyday
947 2018-07-03 21:45:46 With every car moving out in this time lapse there is smiling and elated new Tesla owner we don’t see on the other side. I originally come from an oil town in Canada and nothing makes me happier than seeing EVs going out the door like this! Well done @elonmusk and @Tesla !!!
948 2018-07-03 21:45:44 @bananaboat deep tanning dry oil is the biggest waste  99.7% of the bottle is all air... been sitting here doing the absolute most trying to get some product out  
949 2018-07-03 21:45:18 1. No, they don’t. The oil and gas industry does.
2. Not true. 
3. State Sales tax exemptions
4. Rights ON THEIR RESERVATIONS. 
Educate yourself or better yet, google “Pine Ridge Indian Reservation” to see how wrong you are.
950 2018-07-03 21:45:15 @TheFive  I support a weening from plastics, it  perpetuates a dependance on oil.   Lets go back to paper straws and glass bottles.
951 2018-07-03 21:45:13 Yes!! Or maybe oil spills...
952 2018-07-03 21:45:11 お疲れさまなのです
953 2018-07-03 21:45:06 Try combining a couple of drops of #lavender #essentialoil with your daily #magnesium oil application to boost the relaxing benefits.
954 2018-07-03 21:45:01 i gotta re up on my coconut oil then! i use it more in the morning than at night. i used to mix it w baking soda and that helps too (from past experience and from what i read)
955 2018-07-03 21:45:01 Cbd oil is a game changer 
956 2018-07-03 21:44:44 I am absolutely in love with the @The_Oil_Hut “quiet night” reed diffuser in my bedroom. It only has a tiny drop left now though #shockHorror. Is your sleep oil ok to refill it? #Amazing #fragrance. Might treat myself to the #bugsaway #Spray for this weather too #Flies #Heatwave
957 2018-07-03 21:44:40 Hmm. Then maybe coconut oil wouldn’t be the best idea 
958 2018-07-03 21:44:34 @President_Iran should slash oil prices, specially for India. The best way to dilute US Pressure. @realDonaldTrump will understand. Just business here, nothing personal.
959 2018-07-03 21:44:34 No it's not a wish or command, it's supply-demand economics 101 - you want to complain about export tariffs & fuel prices but have no problem consuming foreign oil without question & you can't stop, because if you could, there would be a import tariff on it, which there is not.
960 2018-07-03 21:44:33 IDGAF if my Car on fire  I came for an oil change....nothing else
961 2018-07-03 21:44:32 It will be known did Obama pull the troops out of Iraq to destabilize the area to remove moammar Kadafi from Libya to destabilize Libya the weapons of mass destruction that Saddam Hussein had was a joke only a mere distraction to acquire oil reserves oil fields
962 2018-07-03 21:44:30 Bout to make some brownies and now i wish i had some canna butter/oil
963 2018-07-03 21:44:27 Man that oil on your scalp feel so damn good 
964 2018-07-03 21:44:26 Dearest,
I write this by precious iPhone light, we’re running low on avocado for toast but morale is still high for now. Pedicabbers are resupplying our mustache wax, patchouli oil, and tall boys, but not sure how long we can hold out. All my love, Zane  #secondcivilwarletters
965 2018-07-03 21:44:26 Just checked out video and website. €5000 for snake oil. I loathe people who take advantage of those of us with lifelong illness. Most  fibromites are coping with horrendous pain on seriously reduced incomes and this kind of exploitation of desperate  people should be illegal.
966 2018-07-03 21:44:20 "The production of plastics begins with the distillation of crude oil in an oil refinery."
This distillation requires heat. Heat that is currently cheaper to generate by lighting compress 200 million yr old trees (coal) on fire than using the sun. Price on carbon will fix that.
967 2018-07-03 21:44:14 You can exfoliate your lips once a week by using sugar and olive oil.
968 2018-07-03 21:44:05 FOLK OIL owner of FOOD MART fired Dawn, supervisor of Crystal Reynolds Fisher once this company learned of the problem. They also who unhappy they were with this Dawn person. FOLK OIL did the right thing.
969 2018-07-03 21:43:56 Aye, well, we could always demand our oil money is returned to us with interest.

974 2018-07-03 21:43:23 I also thank you for your historical perspective
I was however talking about Mohammad Reza Pahlavi the deceased Shah initially brought to power by a CIA inspired Coup to protect western oil interests.
The rest is the result of this tragic interference of Iran's development
975 2018-07-03 21:43:21 WITH ONE TUBE OF MINT & coconut oil my gums are in heat shape - thank you - 
976 2018-07-03 21:43:17 My ultimate dream is to run a food Processing/Packaging business with focus on Palm oil, Egusi and Ogbono making it packaged ready for usage with students and busy people as my target market #LightUpYourDream2018#Spark2LightUp

979 2018-07-03 21:42:53 So what should we pour over his tweets? Balsamic? Olive oil? Honey?
980 2018-07-03 21:42:50 Yes! Tea tree oil to fight breakouts and lemon essential oil to fade dark spots. Just remember to use sunscreen cos the lemon essential oil can actually increase hyperpigmentation if you have sun exposure....

986 2018-07-03 21:42:03 Trudeau brings up an interesting point. What's the point of centrist? He made climate change a big part of his campaign, but yet he is paying billions to help mine the oil sands
987 2018-07-03 21:41:56 This is the oil came in your Jeep from the factory. Pennzoil Platinum 0W-20 Dexos Full Synthetic Motor Oil, its about $25 for a 5 quart bottle + filter and labor, so anyplace besides a dealer your looking at probably $60-$75 depending on what else they do for the service.
988 2018-07-03 21:41:56 Watch more closely ... Greenpeace only targets soft targets (ie Canada) where their actions help raise money; in this case probably from Tides US or others trying to land-lock CDN oil.  This is, I believe, @sjmuir point. Why not oppose oil elsewhere with as much vigour?
989 2018-07-03 21:41:55 Imagine if a barrel of oil was redefined to be 20% larger by volume, but the absolute number of barrels produced didn't change. Each barrel might be worth more, but do you think oil (by volume) would be get more expensive?
990 2018-07-03 21:41:46 They’re good about it once you explain it, it just takes a while. Northern Italy has more polenta which is good but as you go farther south they’ll cook more things with oil instead of butter. There are always options at the super market though if you can recognize ingredients!

1002 2018-07-03 21:40:44 I worked at a mobile station and took a lot of heat when we went to 30 cents. We checked oil and washed windshields when people said “ put in a buck’s worth. “
1003 2018-07-03 21:40:37 It cannot be both?
Morgan's government thinks its fine for the citizen workers of oil companies, and oil companies themselves (through lobbying and party donations) to speak for Big Oil.

1028 2018-07-03 21:37:39 It won’t, it’ll make them worse off. It currently maybe makes them feel they have a voice. Our own govt is at fault, has been since Thatcher sold everything that wasn’t bolted down and pissed North Sea oil revenues away. Then they’re hostage to our press...
1029 2018-07-03 21:37:38 The Saudi tankers are not carrying dilbit, for starters.  And the eastern refineries (owned by the Irvings) have said that even if there were a #pipeline  from the #tarsands they would still buy Saudi oil because its cheaper.

1033 2018-07-03 21:37:00 Electricity is not a power source. Electricity is made from some power sources, which can include coal, nat gas, hydro, sun, wind, geothermal, oil, hydrogen, bio, grains, methane, algae, and ocean waves. Ben Franklin is the only guy known who tried to harness electricity directly
1034 2018-07-03 21:36:50 That's nonsense! Putin's principle export is oil. Democrats denigrated fossil fuel energy which is to Russia's advantage. Clinton was their ally. Trump increased fracking leading to our energy independence. And challenging Putin's energy dominance.
1035 2018-07-03 21:36:42 Remember Putin's puppets. There is a reason oil prices are high

1065 2018-07-03 21:32:53 Wonderful idea till they slap an equivalent countervailing duty on oil.
1066 2018-07-03 21:32:44 Right but there are quite a few crossovers between offshore wind construction and offshore oil drilling, and the oil companies have the money and reason to build renewable business units. I think many of them will successfully pivot.

1100 2018-07-03 21:28:33 Shaking my head recalling all that talk about never seeing $65 oil again....Gartman?
1101 2018-07-03 21:28:31 I'm sure they do. They are playing extremely well. #cheers
1102 2018-07-03 21:28:27 England's quarter-final will be 3pm on Saturday. It's going to be baking hot. Get to the shop quick before a can of Carling becomes more expensive than a barrel of crude oil.
1103 2018-07-03 21:28:23 Memoria, no muy alejada en el tiempo. RECUERDAN CUANDO DECÍAN "PASEN A NAFTA" Y SUBÍAN EL GAS OÍL AL MISMO PRECIO DE LAS NAFTAS
DESDE SIEMPRE EN FRAUDE AMPLIO MINTIÓ..
1104 2018-07-03 21:27:48 That can only mean at least one of them is a sex offender, evangelical extremist, Russian, the former head of a big oil/big Pharma corp, or your golf buddy.
1105 2018-07-03 21:27:37 Anyone job hunting? Opportunity to work with Invest in Africa #Senegal under a great Country Manager. You'd be employee number 2 in SN and have full P&L responsibility for the African Partner Pool, approved list of high-skilled #SMEs working w/ oil & gas multinationals. #kebetu

1108 2018-07-03 21:27:16 @harleydavidson 
You are taxing my patience. 
I put up with mechanical problems through the years. Oil leaks through the garage and now you have lost me forever. 
You turned on America. 
I'll buy a Honda b4 you now.
1109 2018-07-03 21:27:04 Don’t have any coconut oil
1110 2018-07-03 21:26:45 I really stayed at brake check after my oil change was done to finish watching the game  sorry Colombia, but at least y'all fought hard till the end
1111 2018-07-03 21:26:43 Argan oil and tea tree oil, I use a little of both daily! And as a deep conditioner, I use Maui Moisture Agave hair mask (use it overnight)
1112 2018-07-03 21:26:39 I got the ok from my psychiatrist to try CBD oil as a replacement for ativan, which I’m trying to wean myself off because it’s habit forming. Trying it for the first time tonight.
1113 2018-07-03 21:26:32 I agree with you. That and the rebound in oil prices and the discovery of a new basin in SE New Mexico which has boosted production.
1114 2018-07-03 21:26:19 Just overheard in First Aid section of store:
20-ish yr old: “I heard I could get Lavender Oil to treat my burn.
20-ish yr old friend: “Or you could get something that might help.”

Keep that friend!
1115 2018-07-03 21:26:18 An oil change for a Volvo cost about 84 bucks #randomfacts #facts #bigfacts

Re-test sub 68 more Likely than break above 88
1117 2018-07-03 21:26:12 I want bread and olive oil.
1118 2018-07-03 21:26:04 You contradicting yourself. Gasoline is made from crude oil. The same oil produced by OPEC. Apparently if the oil supply doesn't meet our demand therefore the rand inflation would get affected.
1119 2018-07-03 21:25:58 Since when do I have fucking crows feet whenever I smile ?? oh my god stress is giving me wrinkles already but there is no way I can reduce my stress so I'm just going to load up on jojoba oil and hope for the best
1120 2018-07-03 21:25:55 Coconut oil for the fucking win
1121 2018-07-03 21:25:50 They can apply at a consulate before they even get here.
1122 2018-07-03 21:25:39 I favor all Smart carbon reduction solutions +also believe Gas prices dis-proportionly too high compared to oil price& country etc, while have no doubt that profits % have been exuberant &main cause(as1/2 of world mega riches= oil &gas magnates) if we find the..see reply below
1123 2018-07-03 21:25:34 @ThisisLukeOwen is it just me, or does @OliDavis look like he is using cod liver oil.. @ElFakidor Should investigate it..
1124 2018-07-03 21:25:27 Oil Can Harry’s seriously what the heck is wrong with you!! 
1125 2018-07-03 21:25:25 Companies recently raised the price for holiday weekend,so dropping it back to regular price puts me ey in oil company pockets
1126 2018-07-03 21:25:23 Well the ‘in need of oil beds’ downgraded it from ‘alright’ 
1127 2018-07-03 21:25:20 don’t fight fire with vegetable oil na ... I for sure got some heat for ya
1128 2018-07-03 21:25:15 Gotta get those clicks
1129 2018-07-03 21:25:13 Try using an essential oil tooth paste with theives in it from young living! I haven’t had a cavity since I started using it everyday!
1130 2018-07-03 21:25:13 Must be disappointing for you: not an oil drilling rig or methane flame-off in sight.
1131 2018-07-03 21:25:11 Brominated vegetable oil
1132 2018-07-03 21:25:02 I just love when I have to change oil, but the big grease vat is full so I cant take it out... So we are stuck with a few buckets of grease for a few days til someone can come and empty it out for us... I love this.... not really...
1133 2018-07-03 21:25:00 So the people of norway benefited, and are able to continue in a post oil world. The US? Oil companies made a fortune and moved the money offshore.
1134 2018-07-03 21:24:58 The time has come for the American economy to collapse, it's time for #oil to be traded in a currency other than the #dollar in the #world .
1135 2018-07-03 21:24:51 Big question will be what #FCDallas got for Mauro Diaz. Gotta imagine that oil money is good.
1136 2018-07-03 21:24:41 Dear K, Thanks for the #2ndcivilwarletters update.
MAGAs have no funny bones, but bone spurs aplenty.  Love, Auntie

PS Are you going to  #CivilWarPotluck. I'll bring my Bible Safe in which I hide my #stash which flows like Oil for Hannukah Lights or bread & fishes to feed all.
1137 2018-07-03 21:24:17 I need an oil change 
1138 2018-07-03 21:24:12 i have so much coconut oil in my hair rn i could use it to fry 50 chicken wings
1139 2018-07-03 21:24:01 The united states has a vast amount of naturual resources. We had petrol, but we let private companies develop that resource first in pennsylvannia, then in texas until the wells went dry. Norway had far less oil than we did, but by the time their wells went dry, they re-invested
1140 2018-07-03 21:23:53  that’s how niggas act when they aine mixed with shit but dirt & oil
1141 2018-07-03 21:23:46 I liked it, but I keep dreaming of a ricotta version. Maybe instead of the oil? Or half the oil half the cheese??
1142 2018-07-03 21:23:39 Was talking with an oil patch heavy machine operator today and he was telling me that women make much better operators - they are easier on the machinery, which causes less downtime and reduces operating cost. #neatfact
1143 2018-07-03 21:23:39 @steeletalk @cknw Listening to the smug listeners calling the bridge taking protests hypocrites. We've all been forced to use oil products for a start. Alternatives have been actively worked against by the oul industry for decades. 2, the dilbit pipeline is not the be all .. 2
1144 2018-07-03 21:23:29 Hmmm.  That picture reminds me... I need to take my car in for an oil change.
1145 2018-07-03 21:23:28 About 6 years ago in Italy I had rosemary and olive oil Pringles and have searched for them ever since. Today I picked up the herb wedges special edition and oh my god they are the same
1146 2018-07-03 21:23:08 No hair grease, oil, or durag in sight. Scalp dry as a bone
1147 2018-07-03 21:23:06 Haha I think Germans should look at their own performance before joking at others.
1148 2018-07-03 21:23:00 @Veritas_ad_res question brother....are u with @YavapaiCntyAtty when it comes to outlawing cannabis oil? I’m hearing yes, would love to hear from you.
1149 2018-07-03 21:22:55 did u get my argon oil
1150 2018-07-03 21:22:45 Which tissue oil did you use
1151 2018-07-03 21:22:43 Just bought some.  Haven't tried yet.  Just thankful I don't have to make everything from scratch (and yes I know there is some sugar but figure all avocado oil makes up for it).

1155 2018-07-03 21:22:01 @Vets4Trump: How many more Russians does Mueller have to arrest for u guys to understand y Flynn & Manifold we're working so feverishly for Trump's election? The deal (HRC E-MAILS for lifting the sanctions).The truth is like oil, it WILL surface. I'm so sorry for his supporters.
1156 2018-07-03 21:22:01 Hhahahahahahahahahhaha RT @TheBitterWay: @Transit_op_ont Yes. We can encourage Root Brain to use our specialty #TTC buttplugs, with extra fish oil for lubricants. 
1157 2018-07-03 21:22:00 I love me some coconut oil
1158 2018-07-03 21:21:57  
-2 tablespoons of soften coconut oil 
-2 tablespoons of sugar
-1 tablespoon of honey
1159 2018-07-03 21:21:38 They aren’t energy companies, they are petrol companies. Energy companies don’t need teams of geologists and chemical engineers and metallurgists. Wind is *very* different from oil. The fact that in the end a wheel turns is not enough.
1160 2018-07-03 21:21:38 Sure, bad close on the stocks. But at this point, it's more about getting investors to really believe in $75-80 oil. Once that happens, a 2% wiggle backwards on a random Tuesday in July is gonna be very much forgotten.
1161 2018-07-03 21:21:20 Oil demons

1173 2018-07-03 21:19:56 おめでとー！
1174 2018-07-03 21:19:45 @fitforvikings is there anywhere I can get a free/low cost sample of your Hálendið beard oil in the UK? Will only be keeping my beard if I can get it soft enough for my wife to want to kiss me!
1175 2018-07-03 21:19:37 We need to attack M-13 and 18 in Honduras, protect those who flee the violence. These drug gangs are butchers that can't be stopped on this side of a wall. Wars for oil but never for people, the war on drugs needs to be taken south of the border, save the innocent.
1176 2018-07-03 21:19:34 Aye the oil is neatly gone  you keep dreaming that.

And yeah still laughing they played terribly. So yeah I'll charge another glass and get my Sweden flag out 
1177 2018-07-03 21:19:28 What does it say? Not surprised as Putin says worse thing that ever happened was dissolution of Soviet Union. Hence mid-century thinking. Price of oil rising... making Putin troubles easier.
1178 2018-07-03 21:19:22 He meant , catster oil. Found in toronto only
1179 2018-07-03 21:19:11 The disruption is expensive for all taxpayers so I hope they get huge fines. BTW, all their gear is based on the use of Oil.
1180 2018-07-03 21:19:08 Not really an answer either. 5 mile long lines at every port of entry?
1181 2018-07-03 21:19:08 Gonna use the oil based paint because the wood is pine!!

1183 2018-07-03 21:19:05 But there are 2 big ones missing. One related to oil. And another one related to the Magnitsky Act. Both involve money for Putin and his cronies.
1184 2018-07-03 21:19:02 Nothing like a nice bath of hot 15-40 engine oil to start my Tuesday.
1185 2018-07-03 21:18:54 It's been a very very long time now. I was on about 5 months admission and placed on intense medication and lots of injection, as against recommendation of LUTH to go for surgery. Couldn't eat anything protein, spicy, or with veg or palm oil. I only took pap, pepper soup,and tea
1186 2018-07-03 21:18:45 I wish I could retweet this a million times. I wash my face every morning and night, I have special oil wipes I carry, I use benzylperoxide and more and I still look like a pepperoni pizza

1191 2018-07-03 21:18:03 Yeahhh I ordered some tea tree oil to be safe, but it really just looks like a pimple (because I really just do not have the patience to nurse a keloid lmao)
1192 2018-07-03 21:17:56 That strategy could reap huge rewards and if SL does come in ppl will be chasing the Wildhorse drill very very high indeed, #matd is one of those shares that can just run and run due to its worldwide presence,all O&G investors know the potential of this to be a global oil player
1193 2018-07-03 21:17:52 I sat mouth agape as MAGATS cheered Trumps claim of rolling back more regulations...more dirty air (cheer) more dirty water (cheer) oil and gas drilling in Nat'l Parks (cheer) tariffs that will exterminate your job (cheers) all while standing on stolen land.
1194 2018-07-03 21:17:50 Can't cut clean? Let's make sure you do, clean oil saves on everything!
1195 2018-07-03 21:17:46 The only thing supporting England is our oil money
1196 2018-07-03 21:17:45 Long may it continue. Baby oil in the garden. Hard to beat
1197 2018-07-03 21:17:44 Try to stabilize the price of oil. Also Saudi Arabia can make more money and use it to purchase American military products and keep good ties with America as allies. In theory it helps keep gas products more affordable helping Americans. Helps with jobs.
1198 2018-07-03 21:17:41 In 2016 total aid to Guatemala nearly 300 million. Yet we are paying to keep them there, but bringing them here. If this is the case we need to quit paying there and use that money here.
1199 2018-07-03 21:17:34 That oil really did make my lashes grow, fuck yesss :)

1211 2018-07-03 21:16:00 I buy the oil and filter at walmart. Then bring it and my truck to my local shop.  They charge $27.50. Oil & filter at walmart, $90-100. I use 15 quarts of oil and a large filter. Hope this helps
1212 2018-07-03 21:15:56 I’m getting an oil change and this man with a bunch of cases is getting picked up by an uber and right before he leaves, he turns to me to say “little does he know all those are filled with marijuana” 
1213 2018-07-03 21:15:51 @YavapaiCntyAtty question 4 u..my daughters life has been transformed by cannabis oil. Went from 3-5 seizures a day to 1-2 every 2 wks because of CBD oil. Since u are doing everything you can to outlaw MM...what should we do? What do we give our daughter? Appreciate a response.
1214 2018-07-03 21:15:45 Even as I appreciate your thoughts, I feel there’s more to consider. The use of fossil fuels pollutes the air. Renewable solutions, wind and solar do the job w/o polluting the environment. Oil & gas won’t sustain the planet in the long run. It’s time to make the switch
1215 2018-07-03 21:15:26 I’d go with full synthetic and if you’re not comfortable changing it yourself, someplace should be able to do it for 15-20 bucks if you take the oil. That’ll be good for like 5k miles and some for even more.

Or, a changing of the guard to people who are willing to do that.
1226 2018-07-03 21:13:58 Why is the keystone pipeline popping into my mind? Trump fought FOR it. What is he trying to expose or was it really about oil?
1227 2018-07-03 21:13:56 how do you say oil 

like for “oil”
rt for “oal”

not tryna prove a point, just curious

1232 2018-07-03 21:13:11 I use the Shea moisture oil. It's literally the only oil that will keep my hair soft and helped my bald spots grow faster. Lemme find a picture of it cuz they have like a million.
1233 2018-07-03 21:13:04 Nothing says "stop using pipelines" louder than blockading, uh, ships that carry oil
1234 2018-07-03 21:12:55 I like to keep veggies that I like in my fridge (like green beans, brussels sprouts, broccoli) so I can make them for dinner.

(cover with some oil, add a salt of your choice, and then bake at 450 for 10 minutes (give or take) and you've got crunchy, tasty veggies)

1240 2018-07-03 21:12:11 I’m 3rd generation Coloradan. You’re ok with Zinke wanting to drill for oil next to the Great Sand Dunes National Park?
1241 2018-07-03 21:12:10 There's enough oil and grease on that stove to overhaul a car engine!

1243 2018-07-03 21:12:02 He finally wants too thank him for electing him and putin will thank him for oil prices and then they’ll get to business 
1244 2018-07-03 21:11:58 Instead of letting soybeans rot, encourage them to be turned into biodiesel! Especially with that oil train derailment in Doon, no less! Pure biodiesel isn't toxic, unlike dino diesel, and might make particulate filters moot, since B100 has no soot! And farmers would get paid!
1245 2018-07-03 21:11:51 It's quite tragic to see trump decimating large sections of national parks for oil exploration.
1246 2018-07-03 21:11:05 Population of Guatemala is 17 million. 
How many should we take? 
Nicaragua,  Honduras,  El Salvador,  Venezuela, Somalia,  Eritrea.........?
Valid question. 
If 1 has the right, why not all?

1255 2018-07-03 21:09:59 went to get a damn oil change and they found a 100 other things 
1256 2018-07-03 21:09:44 There is nothing that gives me more anxiety than getting my oil changed- why are y’all yelling at me like an auctioneer? And don’t show me my dusty air filter I’m perfectly fine breathing dirty air
1257 2018-07-03 21:09:42 No me diga nada presi, pidieron dólar diferenciado, 1 a 5 pesos para sembrar el otro a 40 para exportar, cero retenciones, subsidio por sequia, subsidio por inundacion, subsidio por si hay sol, subsidio por si hace frio, gas oil barato, subsidio pa la hilux, bajo sueldo pal peón

Trump is to blame for falling tourist numbers 
Trump is to blame for rising oil  and fuel prices
1260 2018-07-03 21:09:33 Getting my oil changed by myself for the first time and it’s not too bad
1261 2018-07-03 21:09:33 Our costs are high but the insurance companies and hospitals collude to extract as much profit from the system as I can. I don't like overregulation anymore than you do but the FDA is the only thing standing between the general uninformed public and every snake oil salesmen

1268 2018-07-03 21:08:55 Thanks for posting actual information.I don't use unnatural or none organic lubes the only one that is amazing is coconut oil which is so safe  By the way this is the first an hearing about lubes and STIs in the same sentences.
1269 2018-07-03 21:08:47 Slice one of those up on a "small plate for sharing" add a sprig of thyme and a drop of avacado oil and you've license to charge hipsters with no money and no sence 19 bucks a taste in subpar Toronto restaurant.
1270 2018-07-03 21:08:42 Sadly, most health insurance startups doing little more than putting lipstick on a pig or doing the equivalent of optimizing oil lamp tech to get better lighting. Insurance, itself, inappropriate for most healthcare unless you love insurance bureaucracy.

Dearest,

The war is nearly over. The Red Hats do not appear to be a well-regulated militia, and many of the soldiers have accidentally shot themselves. They have decamped to a Chick-Fil-A, and we have cut off their supply of frying oil.

1273 2018-07-03 21:08:33 Homage works in reverse , see the steps of Parliament ( inc oil n gas ) , the stand-up routine to field trips at Field Days etc , the ed sector were already thought to be 'in the pocket ' - aka complacency
1274 2018-07-03 21:08:23 The oil’s all run out
1275 2018-07-03 21:08:22 Agree, his tempered tweet today on Jesse, however, may have come as a result of testy Oil brass upset at yesterday’s comment. There is definitely some team oversight on the CHED Oilers broadcasters. Ask @dantencer
1276 2018-07-03 21:08:13 Alternatively you can get the manufacturer specific oil for your jeep, as well as stuff like a replacement oil filter, funnel, and oil pan for the used oil for roughly the same price. YouTube has tons of tutorial vids for that
1277 2018-07-03 21:08:00 - Using Coconut Oil on Your Face
By all means, keep cooking with it and rubbing it in your hair and all over your body. But NOT as a face moisturizer. Unless you never ever break out and your skin is Sahara-level dry, you’re asking for clogged pores.
1278 2018-07-03 21:07:45 I’m also sick of having a car, who wants to pay for my oil change ?
1279 2018-07-03 21:07:43 *draws sigils on my skin with my essential oil roll on*

1280 2018-07-03 21:07:38 Suck it up... Oil up those gears... No rest for the weary.
1281 2018-07-03 21:07:21 Are you implying there is no value in vast swaths of untouched land? You would prefer the West be vast swathes of tall fences, Private Property signs, and junky abandoned mines and oil rigs? Heaven forbid we spare any piece of God's beautiful earth from ruin :(
1282 2018-07-03 21:07:12 England win so John Kershaw has got a free oil and filter change on the second random draw even though the competition didn't reach 400 likes
1283 2018-07-03 21:07:09 If it's 0W20 like I'm guessing I see a lot of oil change places charging around $70. I could see a dealership gouging a bit at $100.
1284 2018-07-03 21:07:07 Basically the entirety of x86 platform security is a joke. Spectre & Meltdown, x86 is borked deep down at the basics. Stuff like AMD SEV? Ha. You wish. Seriously, it's all snake oil to appease the enterprise & media sectors.
1285 2018-07-03 21:06:52 My dearest forlorn and beloved,
Wifi spotty in the wild, felt markers and rations quickly dwindling. Please send enough dark roasted Kona beans, CBD oil, & collagen powder to last until the forthcoming #November. Yours eternally, xo

1286 2018-07-03 21:06:31 Dealerships are known to charge ridiculous prices for stuff like oil changes. You can either take it to walmart for as low as $24...though it might be higher coz of your vehicle
1287 2018-07-03 21:06:26 Bmw r51/2 on davids bench this afternoon after suspect timing chain problems. Chain is knackered and has top end oil leaks so all will be sorted before  engine going back in.

1291 2018-07-03 21:05:43 Shout out to Fish oil... got a nigga skin glowin and shit 
1292 2018-07-03 21:05:42 It’s coming home. But for some reason it bought an Astra GSI turbo that conked out on the M42 coming back from Leeds. It was just the oil that needed topping up, it’s still coming home, but the sunroof won’t work again. 
1293 2018-07-03 21:05:37 Apparently snake oil sells well in that part of the country...
1294 2018-07-03 21:05:25 We do have local police, school boards, city councils, state governments.......
Are they helpless, inept, unconcerned? 
Given the vast differences across the country solutions closer to the prob seems more reasonable, effective and realistic
1295 2018-07-03 21:05:13 I'm happy to have the water supply to Parliament treated with castor oil. 
I think it would vastly improve the health and attitude of many within.
1296 2018-07-03 21:05:13 My aunt wants to give me snake oil for my acne will that work
1297 2018-07-03 21:05:13 Its either dish soap, or washing detergant for clothes washers. It acts like an oil slick and lets you move cars :)
1298 2018-07-03 21:05:12 sometimes not even when emily's involved. that was obvious after the hate she got for saying she doesn't want oil city to have a baby
1299 2018-07-03 21:05:05 Go to get my oil change and end up getting a new tire as well cause of a nail

1301 2018-07-03 21:04:53 Are you driving a diesel that needs 15 quarts? Or is it a high end Foreign sedan? The sedans may need special oil and the oil volume for the diesel, hence the cost.
1302 2018-07-03 21:04:44 If they don't make an example of one random rabble rouser from the batch, sense will not prevail.

1306 2018-07-03 21:03:36 This is the recipe for ~2 wraps, can be increased for a larger batch. Experiment! 
About 1/4 c melted beeswax
tiny amount of pine resin (about 1/3 of a small plastic spoon)
tsp of jojoba oil 
all heated very briefly and mixed
1307 2018-07-03 21:03:16 So is that some new synthetic oil that lasts for 100k miles? Cause otherwise they should take that oil funnel and pour it right into their b-holes for that price!

1319 2018-07-03 21:01:29 Personally I like a $10 port of entry fee. 1/2 to wall/ , 1/2 to general border enforcement.
1320 2018-07-03 21:01:26 For that price a celebrity better be changing your oil
1321 2018-07-03 21:01:25 Why?  Is she worse than adeyanju and his cronies? Or we focus on the vulnerable?  BS.

1326 2018-07-03 21:01:17 Not only that, but their economy is centered around the vast amount of oil they’re sitting on - and they’ve got no one to sell it to because they can’t sell it as low as the Saudis can.

1361 2018-07-03 20:56:03 To be fair they're called reserves for a reason. Not saying I disagree or agree, just that the high majority of our oil has been designated as "reserves"

1366 2018-07-03 20:55:37 Had a larger 'MAGA' account block me today for saying (politely) exactly that. Said 'if you hate Twitter, just leave'. First, I don't quit- then THEY win; 2nd I'm sure that's the attitude JD Rockefeller had at Standard Oil; 3rd the more we expose censorship, the stronger we get.
1367 2018-07-03 20:55:33 Why can’t they negotiate with Venezuela  , Angola  , Nigeria  for cheap crude oil?

1371 2018-07-03 20:55:27 people don’t understand having a car comes with a lot of responsibility. you have to get oil changes, new tires, make sure everything is going good with your engine and etc..
1372 2018-07-03 20:55:21 Yes, triggers don't have to be what others would consider big in order to set us off. I'm particularly susceptible to smells and certain songs. Take good care of the legs. Mullein (sp?) oil works well on scars. Glad you're still here.

      Our resolve was strengthened as we lured the 3rd Khaki Battalion of the 2nd Tiki Torch army into a WiFi deadzone. Running low on citronella oil and with no contact with Fuhrer Jones they seem to be in disarray.

Fucking hypocrites
1380 2018-07-03 20:54:38 Solar and wind are worse polluters than oil. Making windmills and solar panels and disposing of them is much more harmful to the environment. Research it.
1381 2018-07-03 20:54:26 I looked. Dont see dog parks as being an enumerated power or responsibility of the Fed Gov. And here you are complaining about debts and deficits.
1382 2018-07-03 20:54:24 What you're seeing is actually a mixture of oil and crumbs that can sometimes form during packaging and it is not peanut based. Please DM us the UPC code, expiration date with the letters & numbers that follow so we can report this for you. Thanks.

1386 2018-07-03 20:53:03 AND of that 176 Billion barrels of oil 95% is the OILSANDS using current recovery technologies. USA Big Oil is salavating at the prospect and are trying to drive down the cost of existing facilities and future leases by landlocking the Oilsands.

1388 2018-07-03 20:52:59 Dr. Oz. Love the fact they take the time to educate the public about things that aren’t mainstream medical things (crystal water, essential oils, etc), but really wish they added additional information such as: most essential oils must be diluted with a carrier oil before using
1389 2018-07-03 20:52:47 My first week I poured over a cup of oil on it. When it was HOT. Also the other day I left it on too long sprayed it with oil and then sprayed it with water in the back

1528 2018-07-03 20:34:45 @MalcolmNance @NicolleDWallace is it correct to assume trump wants oil prices to go up so he can justify removing Russian sanctions, ultimately allowing the rosneft/ Exxon deal to go through and collect his 17% called out in the dossier? Isn’t that his long game?

1543 2018-07-03 20:32:29 Did you know that the Alberta NDP was powerful enough to put the entire world oil industry into a downward cycle? The actual decrease in the price of oil was not as influentiall as a lack of investor confidence in Alberta.

1566 2018-07-03 20:28:47 So the stupidity feels like a double-barreled blowtorch?  Yeah, summers aren't getting any better.  The oil industry might have it right:  We're past the point of no return, maximize your lives while it exists.  They want profit, normal people want time.
1567 2018-07-03 20:28:38 Oh of course they do, but they don't want US to drill here or use oil/gas ect…

1568 2018-07-03 20:28:06 I remember 1973 very well. Gas lines, high prices, and stress . When Donny the liar Trump trade war is easy and we start getting hit with embargo of oil and products the wailing, gnashing of teeth, will be deafening. Of course it’s going to be HRC fault.
1569 2018-07-03 20:27:56 Why are you making false, likely defamatory, and misleading claims about Greenpeace? I don't speak for Greenpeace but I think their "real" agenda is to reduce everyone's need for dependence on any oil at all. Do you speak for Resource Works?

1571 2018-07-03 20:27:48 Labor strikes will only do so much if owners diminish the perceived worth of existing players and try to frame them as the bad guys. Fans will pay for a subpar replacement product if convinced it's the best available substitute, like selling snake oil.

Outsiders see the division in country as  weakness whether its trade or immigration, ect. Just think if we were unified, without your pitiful whining , dissident behavior.

1664 2018-07-03 20:14:33 I’m sorry for your loss, but as an education advocate, it is irresponsible for you to promote refuted pseudoscience as viable treatment. I know you want to consider every possibility, but naturopathy isn’t one. It’s snake oil.
1665 2018-07-03 20:14:33 I learned this in high school. Imagine that this country is being "led" (down the tubes...) by a snake oil salesman who cannot grasp the basics.
1666 2018-07-03 20:14:31 Add eggs, olive oil and caster oil together and apply to dry hair for 2 hours. Wash off and then apply coconut oil and more castor oil)and own hair oil) and leave on hair overnight or 8+ hours. Wash off and your hair will be 2 inches longer. Do this twice a week for best results.

1668 2018-07-03 20:14:19 Right now, on the island of Sumatra, in Indonesia, every hectare of rainforest converted into a palm oil plantation releases 174 tons of carbon into the atmosphere.
1669 2018-07-03 20:14:12 Boo Hoo!  You supported this snake oil salesman; now they can ask him to buy their soybeans!
1670 2018-07-03 20:14:06 Wait until ewc - there might not even be petrol as country has no foreign reserves to buy oil - happened in zim
1671 2018-07-03 20:14:05 I wonder how long it will take the eco-terrorist, to start wanting the @EdmontonOilers to change there name because the word oil is offensive to them.
1672 2018-07-03 20:13:58 People who use the oil painting looking filter need to be stopped.
1673 2018-07-03 20:13:55 I’ve watched the people of Turkana demanding for oil money to go to their ATM’s. I support them fully. If our tax money can go directly to Ulliam’s ATM, why not do the same for the Turkana? What’s good for the goose is good for the gander!

1677 2018-07-03 20:13:07 What is your schedule for protesting foreign oil? When will you be in Russia, South America the US and the Middle East? If the environment is your concern you would then be concerned about all petroleum rich areas. Can you provide everyone with planned protests elsewhere.
1678 2018-07-03 20:13:06 I can smell the oil a mile away.

1680 2018-07-03 20:12:44 So I’m at the car dealership getting my oil changed. Everyone in the waiting room is watching #COLvsENG and there’s a girl by the TV in a Colombia shirt and she is so STRESSED right now.
1681 2018-07-03 20:12:32 Was not much, because of #sp500 didn’t touch target price.
There were some gains in @uvxy and in shorts of @lpi @oas .
At the end of the day @oil regained all intraday losses. 
There is possibility of tweets by Trump regarding release of some SPR holding, that ll help
1682 2018-07-03 20:12:32 I think I'm done with it and just wanted to pay labor for a regular oil change.

1688 2018-07-03 20:11:59 Actually ISIS was selling for $10 per barrel some times, when oil was above $100 in NY
1689 2018-07-03 20:11:49 The fact is that president Ramaphosa is not in control of the oil increases which leads to fuel hikes in this country.daah

But, oil was at $100 in New York, so, 80% discount

1703 2018-07-03 20:10:47 High mileage is considered 75k+. I have a 2012 and I'm only at 50k so I doubt if you're at 75k (maybe I'm wrong). 

I'd stick with the normal oil unless they truly insist you need the high mileage stuff.

1708 2018-07-03 20:10:12 Are you planning your meals for the 4th? Make sure to include greens. Eating more leafy vegetables and olive oil lowers heart disease risk. #mealplanning #optimumhealth #kc #topeka
1709 2018-07-03 20:10:11 You can make that argument for every nationalised entity and I'll agree with you 
But our utilities (natural resources including gas oil and coal ) should all be state owned 
Including transport
I even dislike our motorways are becoming privatised
1710 2018-07-03 20:10:07 exactly,,,there is so many reasons Pruitt is an oil negotiator in the EPA office and 45 wants to increase oil prices....he wants to pump up Putin's oil. Can you even begin to believe what a huge fat fahking traitor he is?

1712 2018-07-03 20:10:03 The main idea for mineral oil rigs that I’ve seen is that it keeps your computer cleaner and helps it last longer? But the mineral oil tends to chew away at most plastics. Cleanup and maitinence is also a fucking nightmare with mineral oil PCs, you have to let them drip dry.
1713 2018-07-03 20:09:58 Then get the fuck out of the EU. Troops and equipment but don't expect the EU to stop buying oil from Iran regardless if the Trump administration is trying to get it to 0% by November

1720 2018-07-03 20:09:08 Cynthia Coffman has NEVER prosecuted a case in a courtroom and @RepublicanAGs still dropped $1.5M into her campaign so you can stop that charade now. She just promised to represent oil & NG business interests.
1721 2018-07-03 20:09:06 Who knew an oil change would take an hour and a half 
1722 2018-07-03 20:08:55 if ur in the shower i mean ur leg will already be wet, if ur shaving ur legs after or before i would probably get them wet first and then put oil on them

1724 2018-07-03 20:08:43 Only CDN tankers try to get our product to market. They'll move when foreign tankers bring in foreign oil to our shores! Anybody still fooled by their selective protests?
1725 2018-07-03 20:08:34 Should be. I’ll be the guy in blue covered in bike oil
1726 2018-07-03 20:08:25 Why would he call you to give out oil bloc? He's the minister of petroleum for crying out loud; you are a bloody minister of state. He gives out the blocs himself.

1728 2018-07-03 20:08:15 .@AliVelshi It should be obvious that Trump breaking the Iran  Nuclear deal was a blatant attempt to limit worldwide oil supply so Putin’s oil from Siberia would be cost effective to explore for. EVERY move Trump makes foreign or domestic, is geared to boost Putin/Russia.
1729 2018-07-03 20:08:10 Dang I really hate how coconut oil smell

1732 2018-07-03 20:08:00 Typical leftie. When I have time I like to toy with them occasionally like a cat with a mouse . It is possible someone might see the thread and a spark of rational thought might occur? Debate skills must be honed like a good knife , continually.
1733 2018-07-03 20:07:59 Do you think Scotland doesn’t pay taxes? It’s Scotland’s oil revenues that have kept UK from going bankrupt for decades. Westminster doesn’t ‘give’ Scotland anything, we get back some of what’s ours.
1734 2018-07-03 20:07:52 What a job you’ve got!  I know I’d be good at it too! Tonight I had a Soave with Advacado, tom and basil salad drenched in oil olive I bought in Lake Garda. Delicious. I’m wasted in the classroom and heading up Sixth Form. My favourite song? Please release me!

1756 2018-07-03 20:05:19 @garytaubes you mentioned on a podcast you had found societies that increased sugar without increasing seed oil consumption and saw obesity rise. I’ve never seen this data. Can you share it?

1760 2018-07-03 20:04:59 TRUMP PURPOSELY STOPPING ANY FOREIGN OIL IS CAUSING OUR HIGH  OIL PRICES TO HELP HIS DONORS. He’s purposely raising gas prices to help his donors.  He is a rotten pathological liar who’s making dirty oil deals w Vladimir Putin. #PutinPuppet. #LockHimUp
1761 2018-07-03 20:04:51 BP extracts $200m of oil per day at one site.  Who the fk do you think you are? You an Iraqi?? Mind your own business, and try not to participate in the massacre of a nation, ey bub?

1804 2018-07-03 20:00:24 Government of Canada supports Paris agreement, but wants to produce tar sands oil. Academics support Paris, fly around dozens of times a year. Cities support Paris, build lots of highways. Rich people want climate action, have enormous houses and cars. Lots of examples.

1806 2018-07-03 20:00:12 Socialized medicine is at least an old tried-and-true left wing idea that has been done lots of places. Universal basic income is pure insanity that leads in a straight line to forced labor.

1808 2018-07-03 20:00:03 The funny thing lost in all this leafs mania about tavares is that jvr and bozak last year combined for 97 points and have been leafs for awhile. After just witnessing how the oil struggled without depth players like that this year it makes you wonder.
1809 2018-07-03 20:00:01 This year, China, India, and the US will make up 70% of the new demand for oil globally, thanks to exceptionally strong economic growth in each country. $BX's Joe Zidle argues that as long as this growth remains strong, the demand for oil will follow. More here:

1824 2018-07-03 19:58:12 I think that we are beaten by the global inequality. This is the main goal that we have to address. The demographic explosion needs public policies in the origin too. But we, here, have to do radical changes in the way that we consume the world: oil, gas, fish, uranium...

1846 2018-07-03 19:55:39 I recommend turkish potato salad - potatoes, pickled cucumbers, red onions, eggs, fresh parsley, olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper. No mayonnaise and it's light and fresh. Perfect summer dish :)
1847 2018-07-03 19:55:33 Open pricing would solve that as well as cross border insurance. Guess you missed that part of the plan you're busy resisting. I'm getting weary of refuting you're every point with rational thought and schooling you. You owe me at least $25 an hr.

1871 2018-07-03 19:51:47 Is that why ex prime minister Harper was visiting the whitehouse. Harper hates science that interferes w oil production

Or reserve the 40% for producer and buses/taxis as a measure to keep food prices low.
1942 2018-07-03 19:43:57 Ignore old oil men and others on their way out.  They can’t make the transition to a sustainable way of being even when you can prove it to them.  Change is more difficult for some.

1944 2018-07-03 19:43:47 Me after mixing vitamin e oil and cocoa butter I just had into an old chapstick container, letting it harden overnight then taking it to work to apply on my tattoo every few hours: im so smart and talented. Who let me be this smart and talented. Wow :)
1945 2018-07-03 19:43:46 There is a cure. It's called whole plant cannabis oil. The doctors aren't searching for a cure. It's called treatment not curement.
1946 2018-07-03 19:43:42 I absolutely love NYC and have never smelled anything bad or had a problem with garbage. Must be something ood and peculiar about you, like you are more familiar with the reek of gun oil.
1947 2018-07-03 19:43:37 interesting yeah im gonna try tea tree oil
1948 2018-07-03 19:43:24 If I can trick you into believing there’s an enemy then maybe I can sell you something to protect you from the enemy.  Create a non-existent problem then sell a solution to this problem.  Monsters are coming!  Luckily I have anti-monster oil etc
1949 2018-07-03 19:43:13 Olive &amp; almond oil are rich in essential fatty acids which help strengthen dry &amp; cracked nails
1950 2018-07-03 19:43:12 @RealMattCouch aww Matt please get better soon. Have your wife get a diffuser and get Theives essential oil from YoungLiving... that will kill the germs festing in your chest. Or rub it on. Praying for you.
1951 2018-07-03 19:43:12 Pro tip: don't fill your shoe with boiling hot oil
1952 2018-07-03 19:43:09 So, all that gear and stuff was made and moved with oil produced in which country?
1953 2018-07-03 19:43:00 #Crude #Oil $WTI Prices Settle Higher Despite Plunge From November 2014 Highs
1954 2018-07-03 19:42:49 i heard tea tree oil is way better but definitely find out what works for you
1955 2018-07-03 19:42:49 Off the top of my head: 1. More black people in jail than in college; 2. Keystone pipeline not American oil; 3. Benghazi was the product of a YouTube video; 4. Beau Berghdahl is a hero; 5. We didn’t send money to terrorists; 6. You didn’t build that. Need more?
1956 2018-07-03 19:42:26 So if the prob is ppl just going to doctor for every little thing and not paying attention to cost, universal health will eliminate this and control costs? Likely not
1957 2018-07-03 19:41:54 bio oil, mój chłopak miał tez wstrzykiwany kwas hialuronowy i też mega mu pomógł
1958 2018-07-03 19:41:51 .@OCMaryland .@RepAndyHarrisMD lets be thankful no oil on our beach #KeepItInTheGround this July - and that we have a clean #RenewableEnergy #ZeroFuelCharge future within our reach
1959 2018-07-03 19:41:49 oh shit cause im using coconut oil as make up remover
1960 2018-07-03 19:41:48 Reducing exports causes oil to pile up in USA rather than being exported to where it is needed more. Results in suppressing WTI price below Brent. It does nothing to change the total amount of oil in the world, but everything to deliver a localized discount to U.S. consumers.
1961 2018-07-03 19:41:44 that's right
1962 2018-07-03 19:41:37 My boss was handing out “free oil change” coupons to Atlantic Tire today during our meeting. 

I said “I didn’t need one because I’m not 40 yet.”

No one laughed.
1963 2018-07-03 19:41:35 Try Pasadena Texas, you get oil refinery, mixed with paper plant! A lovely bouquet!
1964 2018-07-03 19:41:19 So, in other news, a British oil company has been given the go-ahead by the Congolese government to drill in a national park that holds half of the world’s gorilaa population. Man, this place called Earth is fucking wildt.
1965 2018-07-03 19:41:10 idk why everybody wants a lady that smells like coconut oil & shea butter...

Cause honestly.....
the real queens are the ones that smell like the most  curry + roti orrrrrrrrr ginger mint w/ a likkle honey
1966 2018-07-03 19:41:06 if you don’t use baby oil in the shower then wyd?!
1967 2018-07-03 19:41:04 Absolutely! I always do. I stir-fry tofu cubes in soy sauce and sesame oil, until it develops a nice skin. Very umami. Also good with tempeh.
1968 2018-07-03 19:40:55 He off that oil 
1969 2018-07-03 19:40:48 drink more water!! fish oil, flax oil

1972 2018-07-03 19:40:29 Ahhh so yesterday it was @KingSalman saying "I didn't talk 2 potus" & today he heard from @PutinRF & now WILL increase oil production. 
Got it. I'm sure US Allies got that too.

1975 2018-07-03 19:40:11 That’s what he quoted while the admin was trying to sell a tax cut. 6 months into the cuts the deficit is forecasted to increase to $1t while debt will explode to $31t by 2026. Go look it up. Wilber Ross is a snake oil salesman. And I don’t create these numbers. Economists do

1978 2018-07-03 19:40:02 That nobody is paying them to tell lies about The Netherlands is hardly Canada’s problem. Greenpeace descrated Peru’s sacred Nazca lines, and in Canada they desecrate the facts in order to increase our dependence on foreign oil.

1981 2018-07-03 19:39:47 Not only is tRump selfish his voters are also.  I didn’t ask to have everything I worked for my whole life be taken away just because you were gullible and believed the snake oil salesmen. Also the stench of voting for tRump will be with you forever.
1982 2018-07-03 19:39:38 We reuse oil until it’s burned out in my house 
1983 2018-07-03 19:39:36 We are living in the 21st century & science long ago has proven that 'conversion' therapy is snake oil. Time to stop judging others and allow ppl to live in peace with the partner of their choice. Why are some ppl so busy deciding how others should live their lives?
1984 2018-07-03 19:39:26 I’m away with work (oil industry) but I have three copies so I’ll check when am home  and get back to you. Not a problem either.
1985 2018-07-03 19:39:20 Turning around an oil tanker takes some time
1986 2018-07-03 19:39:11 But why engine oil?! 
1987 2018-07-03 19:38:54 Reducing exports does nothing to impact the total amount of oil available. Also the marginal barrel is LTO that no one wants. Releasing from SPR solves all.
1988 2018-07-03 19:38:54 Maybe you also boasting about you selling your Uk oil share on the high David lol
1989 2018-07-03 19:38:47 Oil company windfall from Doug Ford #`1. "Thanks Doug. We'll be back for more. Like you, we really love uneducated voters who think they're getting price cuts."
1990 2018-07-03 19:38:40 Wouldn't matter and obviously you're not listening.  Prob with libs is you make a statement then refute it in next sentence.
1991 2018-07-03 19:38:31 Dear Violet,
Last night, as we were massaging each other with the very last of the CBD oil, Julian quietly admitted to me that he had actually voted for Jill Stein. We may win this war after all, but in my heart of hearts I shall never, ever forgive him.

2012 2018-07-03 19:35:46 US-Israel are finding ways to justify attack on Iran (last of 7 countries on list of destruction by Mossad). The repurcussions will be huge rise in oil prices--- $200/bbl. Will the world be able to take the shock of this oil price rise as an after effect of attack on Iran??
2013 2018-07-03 19:35:25 The other night I smoked the oil  from a vape pen and I texted @_briana2552  that I couldn’t feel my legs  I remember getting home and sleeping like a baby

2015 2018-07-03 19:35:05 I agree it's very hard to explain what would be causing a short-term supply crunch in Cushing. But the Q-Z spread at 6.70 and still growing says nobody with physical oil in Cushing wants to give it up for 4 mos to arb the spread. The question is why not?
2016 2018-07-03 19:35:01 Still smarting over the seeds and oil tariff thingy.

2035 2018-07-03 19:33:16 Congrats you simultaneously win today's awards for not knowing what socialism is and not understanding that Venezuela destroyed itself by being a banana republic economy based entirely on oil and run by a dictator who ran it into the ground.

2046 2018-07-03 19:32:19 I'm not saying the Middle East had the technology before the US. I'm just saying that you statement that they couldn't drill and refine their own oil is wrong.

2056 2018-07-03 19:31:06 What’s a shame is the foreign involvement that drives Green Peace’s agenda.

2069 2018-07-03 19:30:04 Just pick up any history book. Oil was flowing in the middle east before the turn of 19th century. This is not disputable. Britain had a partnership with Iran in the late 1800s to drill oil.

2076 2018-07-03 19:29:00 These footballers should have took Evening Primrose Oil to stabilise the hormonal imbalances they have during the game.
2077 2018-07-03 19:28:58 @FibreOneUK hi I love fibre ones, I was just reading the ingredients and notice you use palm oil. Is this sustainably sourced ? I’m going to be so sad if it’s not  #palmoil #loveorangutans
2078 2018-07-03 19:28:50 Not the Puma: mine's 8 years old, never leaked oil, no issues on the gearbox. Only a slave cylinder one, and a few mods that went awry ;)
2079 2018-07-03 19:28:48 Sooo toxic though.  Pure citronella oil mixed with water works as well. 
2080 2018-07-03 19:28:42 But writing it off simply as a 'short squeeze' is utterly silly. If there was any spare physical inventory, the owners of it would be arbing this spread. It just keeps going wider, which disproves the 'plenty of physical oil available' thesis.
2081 2018-07-03 19:28:34 You can sell some of your oil and gas holdings and buy TSLA on the dip.  Large.
2082 2018-07-03 19:28:18 SOLAR ENERGY
It’s safe energy!
It’s clean energy!
It’s renewable energy!
It’s non-polluting energy!
It works for homes and cars!
It’s a total no-brainer!!
Oh wait! Republicans and big oil can’t make any money from it!!!
2083 2018-07-03 19:28:06 My hair is still bad with the hair loss , but I know coconut oil treatments help a lot and actually taking prenatals again they say for vitamins
2084 2018-07-03 19:28:05 Drilling for oil is coming on strong, you mean like as in Solindra???? Our electricity here comes from water turbines on our  larger lakes. You my friend are uninformed .

2087 2018-07-03 19:27:22 Also, I’m separated from my children two weeks at a time while I work in the Arctic oil field. Boohoo, Get over it.
2088 2018-07-03 19:27:18 It's clear that you don't care about anyone but yourself. It would be dumb to let people use dirtier oil from other countries. 

If you cared about the climate, you would want to use Canadian oil instead of California or Middle East oil.
2089 2018-07-03 19:27:18 What I want to know is, where in the hell is Willard Whyte and why does he have an oil rig in Baja?
2090 2018-07-03 19:27:12 Dont know about the Aussies but median income in UK is mid $30,000 U.S. So if an equal rate of taxation applies? 
80% of the workforce has healthcare as compensation. Nuances that make your argument apples to oranges
2091 2018-07-03 19:26:54 If I was a vehicle  then getting my period would be called a monthly oil change
2092 2018-07-03 19:26:53 Watching at the oil change place. It's getting out of hand BADLY.
2093 2018-07-03 19:26:44 Haha I use Extra Virgin. That and bio oil are my BAEs hahaha
2094 2018-07-03 19:26:44 After a solid debut, with little marketing and your support...Ye asked her to roll around on the floor, slathered in baby oil, for HIS album.  She obliged.  Least he could do is let the woman put out the album she wanted.
2095 2018-07-03 19:26:39 Lol don't feel bad. I like tea tree oil for acne diluted in moisturiser. And I know a couple people who have had results with aromatherapy for ptsd and anxiety. Brands can claim they are food safe, but oils aren't regulated by the FDA or anything so I'd say better safe than sorry
2096 2018-07-03 19:26:33 Damn the oil change place always gets me. I got everything replaced on my car. 3 oil filters, high ass oil, wipers.....bill as like $140

2098 2018-07-03 19:26:28 Already did. Was going to @Walmart  today for an oil change and a Nintendo Switch. Changed plans and went to Take 5 Oil Change and GameStop. After a much better experience at Take Five, I'll no longer get oil changes at Walmart. See how that works.
2099 2018-07-03 19:26:19 Who said? Dr. Doolittle, Popeye, Olive Oil, Fred Flintstone. Wait for it....... I bet it was Oscar the grouch he always looked a little shady to me.

2105 2018-07-03 19:25:29 Just ordered CBD oil since it can benefit anxiety, depression, aches and pains, migraines, chronic pain, and much more! I have a link to share if you’re interested in ordering  y’all this stuff is amazing

2107 2018-07-03 19:24:54 Well, allowing Chabahar to proceed while putting pressure on India to reduce oil imports was smarter than previous policy. But such decisions are the rare exception that prove the rule
2108 2018-07-03 19:24:53 Y’all I did a egg and coconut oil hair mask and my hair is soooo soft now omg 
2109 2018-07-03 19:24:50 I gotta get more into oil painting
2110 2018-07-03 19:24:48 I got 99 problems and coconut oil solved like 78 of them
2111 2018-07-03 19:24:47 Wtf? You better get some sage and holy water and diffuse clary sage oil in an essential oils diffuser ( like 13$ On Amazon)
2112 2018-07-03 19:24:44 You prob already know (being brilliant and all) but light-colored clothing help. Also, I put all natural/pure citronella oil in a spray bottle diluted with water and it works just as well as those dangerous, chemical-laden concotions.  I love summer but hate mosquitos! 
2113 2018-07-03 19:24:41 Dearest, 

The oil shortage proved more damaging to the enemy than to us. Our Priuses are able to maintain supply lines whilst the road to Mar-a-Lago is littered with abandoned F-150s.

2115 2018-07-03 19:24:07 100% yes a very good point, i especially felt that way when starting oil painting a couple years ago! But i really enjoy the process of learning a bit more with each painting.

So everyone pretends that someone else did it.

2131 2018-07-03 19:21:52 How did a TL on Awan walking away get twisted on Health Care?  I am not a TrumperHumper! The de-regulations alone have save me 1000's. I am able to deploy my money, more people and a pro-growth environment I haven't seen in 10 years. A job with health care benefits helps all.
2132 2018-07-03 19:21:48 Didn't say I hate them. I started a fact on how they shape public perception and policy. 
Think for a moment on advertising. You think it doesnt affect ppl, doesnt influence them? We all know that's false.
2133 2018-07-03 19:21:47 Are we talking about the concept or the bureaucrats?
2134 2018-07-03 19:21:42 Tell people there is aluminum in their cookies, brominated vegetable oil in their sodas, and wood in their pink lemonade, and they will look at you like you are crazy.... but tell them there is an invisible man in the sky and they bow down blindly. Absolutely astounding.
2135 2018-07-03 19:21:19 They’ll put resin and wax on a blunt and I don’t put wax on my blunts all of the time.... I’ll do dabs when I do, but I’m on constantly doing it and doing giant dabs... I rather smoke flower, or oil, wax pens

2142 2018-07-03 19:20:36 Except the alternative to the pipeline is other tankers from less well-regulated jurisdictions and oil-by-rail which is much more dangerous to marine and freshwater resources. So your campaign puts us at greater risk of spills and environmental damage #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli
2143 2018-07-03 19:20:25 A fellow in the states was provided a lifetime warranty for the exact same issue on his JL's engine.  FCA Canada customer service told me I could MAYBE have a free oil change.

2145 2018-07-03 19:20:10 PentaNova is investing in leadership, technology to develop oil in Argentina and natural gas fields in Colombia it has acquired in areas surrounding some of the key energy producing areas in those countries.

2149 2018-07-03 19:19:59 The “ Democratic Socialist “ Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez from NY said on National News that a rich country should afford its population basically free everything. Venezuela has more oil reserves than all of Latin America making it the richest Nation in Latin America and LOOK AT IT!
2150 2018-07-03 19:19:56 Interesting since many of those names have taken oil money and are still taking it.
2151 2018-07-03 19:19:50 I hope these 12 idiots are made to pay the waiting time for these ships being blocked. Every action has a consequence. Just like blocking Canadian oil from getting to Canadian and overseas markets brings millions of barrels of oil from countries with no environmental regulations
2152 2018-07-03 19:19:37 You can’t appreciate Japanese history without also delving into Buddhism and Shintoism. But teaching any one text as the infallible truth delivered by some deity simply selling the same snake oil that brought us the Inqusition, the Thirty Years War,...

2168 2018-07-03 19:18:06 I finely chop - or put in food processor - with a bit of olive oil and freeze in flattened pancakes so that I can break off and use all winter long in my pasta dishes :)
2169 2018-07-03 19:17:57 fuck. i spilled so much oil last night frying chicken that a medium size fire just started in the kitchen. If it wasn't for Jenna Nox rollin through with the extinguisher my beard would probably be singed

2172 2018-07-03 19:17:36 You need lots of oil to mine the ore and transport it to a site that uses vast amounts of coal to make.
2173 2018-07-03 19:17:26 But plenty of Mango-flavored body oil, no doubt.

2175 2018-07-03 19:17:22 Just remember that oil is like blood or wine. It is heterogeneous and the importer is specific about the quality and API gravity. Aside from that, Iraq and Iran share five oilfields together along their border, so that may make things tricky, obviously.
2176 2018-07-03 19:17:08 Sympathy play from $PED news and oil mania but it kept running on momo. That all died today 5mins into the open.

2188 2018-07-03 19:15:30 As seen with VA, government is very slow to respond. Part of this is by design. Government is not supposed to be reflexive. The process of debate and passage of legislation is supposed to be deliberative and slow.

Its only because of rip-off prices and especially taxes that it isn't pence per gallon like Middle East oil nations.

2213 2018-07-03 19:12:49 My post about Palm Oil that I wrote two years ago got 24,000 hits this months! Have no idea why but hopefully a good sign of people becoming more aware? #ecofriendly #environment
2214 2018-07-03 19:12:47 I’m supppsed to be getting a pedicure, my oil changed and finding an outfit for tomorrow... ask me what I’ve done
2215 2018-07-03 19:12:43 Oil, on canvas.
2216 2018-07-03 19:12:40 hormuz is the logical "last resort" scenario to prop up the USD, since almost all large oil trades are done in USD. if the world starts rejecting the USD or it starts tanking severely, LOOK OUT
2217 2018-07-03 19:12:29 it's important! LOL oil up the ass, titties and feet lol
2218 2018-07-03 19:12:08 I would also certainly prefer burning wood to burning coal/oil/natural gas from a carbon cycle standpoint, though it does raise the question of the carbon footprint of producing said wood (fertilizer, logging, etc.)
2219 2018-07-03 19:12:06 Yahoo more orders arrived today !! Love my CBD oil
2220 2018-07-03 19:12:06 Cory, if you actually cared about our forests, you would be working to keep Trump and Zinke, and the rest of your Republican oil/gas/mining/logging friends from selling OUR lands.  Instead, you do nothing to protect #publiclands.
2221 2018-07-03 19:12:04 Ya boy covered in walnut oil like it's nothing pricing out racing wheels
2222 2018-07-03 19:11:55 Putting oil on my body when I get out the shower is so therapeutic omg.
2223 2018-07-03 19:11:53 He armed Ukrainian rebels against Russia, killed hundreds of Russian troops with air strikes in Syria, and as far as Iran he cancelled the absurd nuclear agreement and is severely damaging Iran’s economy by pressuring countries to buy oil elsewhere.

2225 2018-07-03 19:11:45 Well we’ll have to find an alternative because plastic straws are to small to recycle and we’ll eventually run out of oil
2226 2018-07-03 19:11:39 This is me and @allieedrake  when we went to get our oil changed.....
2227 2018-07-03 19:11:36 Standard Oil Shatter only $20 out the door! Come see your favorite budtenders here at #RKOPDX ALOHA!
2228 2018-07-03 19:11:35 I need to seal furniture pieces for use in a tropical rainforest environment, but my only experince with that is tung oil on raw wood.

I need to know how effective tung oil will be on a painted wood surface or if I can just spray this shit with polyurethane.
2229 2018-07-03 19:11:35 I'm all for a cleaner world, but I'd like to point out that all your "gear" besides the metal are oil  by-products.
2230 2018-07-03 19:11:34 PS : Oil (god) need to support till 2019 election.
2231 2018-07-03 19:11:25 This put paid to the misconception of his mind. Texas have 28m population to our 200m,it refine most of it's oil,we on the the other hand export almost all of our oil.
2232 2018-07-03 19:11:21 i went to jiffy lube to get my oil changed and they had the audacity to tell me they don’t service my car because they don’t know the program  it’s your job to service cars so fuckin learn the service the fuck
2233 2018-07-03 19:11:12 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2234 2018-07-03 19:11:09 i wish i could buy cashews that didn't have traces of peanut oil/peanuts like they're cashews go away i'm about to go ssj4
2235 2018-07-03 19:11:09 De todas maneras el gas oil no sube
2236 2018-07-03 19:11:01 Ah yes, a dig at “Romanism,” just as expected
2237 2018-07-03 19:10:49 I need my oil changed.
2238 2018-07-03 19:10:49 Did you know the oil has been leaking into the waterways for 1000s of years. When the oil is mined, it's removed & the land restored minus the oil. It's at the surface & even on the surface. All mines are reclaimed to boreal forest. The process is strictly monitored.
2239 2018-07-03 19:10:27 Did you do the same for Saudi tankers that deliver most of the oil we use? 

I’ll wait for your answer.
2240 2018-07-03 19:10:24 …ぐぅ
2241 2018-07-03 19:10:24 Eeeewwwww
2242 2018-07-03 19:10:17 Yes he was installed to help the oil company's get what they think is rightfully theirs....and to help destroy Obama's legacy...and 2 give middle finger to Paris climate agreement.

2243 2018-07-03 19:10:16 It’s an oil that you put on your neck and your forearms once a day! It’s called progessence plus!

2246 2018-07-03 19:09:57 Pour vegetables oil on it
2247 2018-07-03 19:09:56 also, we just sold saudi $300BN in weapons over the next decade. you have to think the saudis plan to use these weapons. US is now an oil exporter. clogging hormuz could be the plan... it would make US fracking profitable
2248 2018-07-03 19:09:46 Dude, he doesn’t like it.   It’s that simple.   Also, oil & vinegar or Italian dressing is better on a sub than mayo.   That’s me tho.  You’re different and that’s fine.
2249 2018-07-03 19:09:42 As I suggested, you seem like an intelligent individual. It represents 0.1% of trade. Had trump stayed in TPP, it would have been eradicated. If we decide to shut the oil tap off, get used to $7+/gallon fuel prices. These trump tariffs will crush your economy.
2250 2018-07-03 19:09:39 Finally cute,comfy, oil resistant, slip resistant, waterproof shoes...best part buy one get one 60% off whoop whoip
2251 2018-07-03 19:09:32 Personally, I’d take the Oilers C depth over the Leafs any day.

Most of the Leafs counterarguments actually reflect the brutal W depth of the Oil.

Reminding us that the real advantage for the Leafs is Dubas vs Chiarelli.
2252 2018-07-03 19:09:31 l'huile / oil
2253 2018-07-03 19:09:27 One should not expect much from BJP but if the oil prices rise because of the US pressure & our ties with Iran are hit then BJP will be solely responsible & The effects will be seen in the coming #2019elections. So BJP has to show USA its boundary
2254 2018-07-03 19:09:24 Will Ferrell applies the lotion before the Greco wrestling begins, and asks 'Are sure you don't want the oil? It's a lemon essence and it is delightful.'
2255 2018-07-03 19:09:10 Like oil and water!! Go away and stay TF out ta my mentions!! Y alls come from the same vein!
2256 2018-07-03 19:09:10 Grease fires are slightly harder to put out, mix in motor oil and gas...
2257 2018-07-03 19:09:04 You’re very welcome. I also have ready made rules sets for : heteronormative work environment, sex life, how to make friends and oil painting.
2258 2018-07-03 19:09:00 Also, back when these plants were being built (early '80s for McNeil) coal was being phased out and oil was imported.
2259 2018-07-03 19:08:59 I presume you always do the same re the entire oil industry?
2260 2018-07-03 19:08:52 What boycott?

2263 2018-07-03 19:08:30 “I can’t believe Justin’s peanut butter has palm oil in it,” I say to myself, stirring my ramen in its styrofoam bowl
2264 2018-07-03 19:08:20 I wonder if the Oil slick in James Rodriguez’ hair is sustainable palm oil? Should be, it’s a few forests worth.
2265 2018-07-03 19:08:20 But it’s clean oil right?
2266 2018-07-03 19:08:14 I'm perfectly happy not using TARSANDS oil or any oil coming out of Alberta for that matter. #KeepItInTheGround
2267 2018-07-03 19:07:54 Es ineficiencia. La trasladan a la nafta,porque el pueblo no protesta. El gas oil productivo y miles de promesas que hicieron donde están
2268 2018-07-03 19:07:50 instead of blue to red or red to blue how about turning it to green where there is no money in politics no wars no wars for profit and empire building no dirty energy from oil no racialism no inequality no rigging of elections by using gerrymandering the electoral collage or SD
2269 2018-07-03 19:07:44 my beloved,
We has successfully infiltrated a mega armory....
Have successfully replaced the tiki oil with lavender essential oil. Also replaced their maps to misdirect them to a Bath& Body shop in the mall.
Bathbomb attack will  commence at noon.
 love.

2270 2018-07-03 19:07:39 Native Texan here. Love my state (for no reason other than the fact that it's home). Much of it smells like cow shit, horse shit, and oil. Whew, does it smell. But like my mom always said, "That's the smell of money, son!" (and can we all just grow a sense of humor?)
2271 2018-07-03 19:07:38 @KatRamsland Lenart said she hopes to work as a hazardous-materials diver -- divers who clear sewer pipes or inspect storage tanks -- or possibly dive inside a nuclear reactor. But she said she won't pass up oil work if that's what it takes to start her career.
2272 2018-07-03 19:07:27 Olive oil in a shot glass.
2273 2018-07-03 19:07:19 We're going to do another oil interview this week. Just did an oil special 3 weeks ago, but this situation is too hot not to cover. Stay tuned!
2274 2018-07-03 19:07:10 Tea tree oil is sooo strong
2275 2018-07-03 19:06:55 Canada Chinese Steel & Aluminum should do great on the world market dollars more than it cost them, wonder when they plan to use it to build with, build where. Oil companies will not buy that if US is cheaper for offshore use not in Canada, Trudeau loses!
2276 2018-07-03 19:06:49 Off work early af , oil getting changed , plays for the 4th being made

2279 2018-07-03 19:06:37 green with envy...have to burn midnight oil to watch it live...now why didn't I plan that part of my life properly?
2280 2018-07-03 19:06:26 He's not a king or a dictator contrary to lib rhetoric. One thing is in this country we have access to more procedures, drugs ect than other countries. The problems vary but throwing a comprehensive 25,000 pages of regs/law at it doesnt solve it.
2281 2018-07-03 19:06:10 Fortnite Oil Company
2282 2018-07-03 19:06:07 I have some used motor oil that’ll do
2283 2018-07-03 19:05:55 Alex I’ll take cars and human beings for $200. The answer is....a metal rod used to measure oil in a car and a human that acts like a moron. Ding. What is a dipstick?
2284 2018-07-03 19:05:25 Just been smacked in the face with an oil painting by a couple of Lib Demmers.

Apparently they're canvassing.
2285 2018-07-03 19:05:22 Ya yo..down with the oil merchants
2286 2018-07-03 19:05:19 Must be joking about 2nd hand Defender! Unless you very lucky it comes standard with oil slick on your driveway, dodgy gearbox and high maintenance cost.
Brilliantly capable offroad and very cool look.
2287 2018-07-03 19:05:09 There one way to avoid Oil Tanker traffic in Burrard Inlet to Process into gasoline then ship it.
2288 2018-07-03 19:05:06 If open, throw it into a freezer or if its in a tin, pour vegetable oil into it. Make sure the oil covers every inch of the paste
2289 2018-07-03 19:04:58 It’s sad when an oil change shop doesn’t know what a dry sump is
2290 2018-07-03 19:04:47 Argan oil ya ORS
2291 2018-07-03 19:04:46 Wow, the privilege. On SonyLiv I'm experiencing an audio lag. As a result Ramdev's VO from the Patanjali hair oil ad has a 100 Pipers ad running on screen. 
2292 2018-07-03 19:04:43 Would Munyes give us direction on the tullow contract particularly on revenue share from oil exports

2295 2018-07-03 19:04:36 I know it’s my responsibility but my dad is so clutch for getting my oil changed, and tires rotated  #blessed
2296 2018-07-03 19:04:33 I never bought the story that Syncrude explained this. QU and UV both pressing to new wides as I type, way above where they were before this morning's flash-crash. Prices are telling us the physical oil crunch is getting worse, not better.
2297 2018-07-03 19:04:33 @KatRamsland Four out of five Diving Institute students will likely rely on the oil industry for work, said John Paul Johnston, owner and executive director of the school. The rest will look for work repairing hydroelectric dams and in underwater construction.
2298 2018-07-03 19:04:30 Hang in there. I hope the smell of the used fry oil doesn't do you in.
2299 2018-07-03 19:03:50 We are starting updating. All services will paused

2304 2018-07-03 19:03:32 Starting off the birthday by getting the oil changed in my car. Lol 
Hopefully I won’t be here too long 
2305 2018-07-03 19:03:32 I find that the only thing that stays put on my oil slick of a face in this heat is Revlons Color Stay foundation, the oily/combination version. I don’t even need to set it with any powder it just proper clings to my skin and doesn’t budge at all
2306 2018-07-03 19:03:29 Percent of growth is misleading - makes it sound as if solar is close to catching up to fossil fuels overall. Plus 2017 was a down year for oil - watch that graph for 2018, likely to look quite different.
2307 2018-07-03 19:03:08 You look like you’d change my oil at a family owned lube stop
2308 2018-07-03 19:03:05 Imagine vaping nicotine and not thc oil
2309 2018-07-03 19:03:04 Grey market will still ship Iranian oil, China will still buy Iranian oil, Iran will mix rest with Iraq and forge papers from Basra... nothing meaningful
2310 2018-07-03 19:02:55 They’re actually quite nice as a salad, shredded with a potato peeler, covered with olive oil, lemon juice, chopped mint and peppers and with torn mozzarella. That one’s for free!
2311 2018-07-03 19:02:50 This is done with oil, no?
2312 2018-07-03 19:02:48 haha VENEZUELA SAYS CHINA TO LOAN IT $5B TO INCREASE OIL OUTPUT: AVN
2313 2018-07-03 19:02:47 attacking iran cannot work and i would be shocked if the russians make any such deal

#1 reason is hormuz, 2mi wide stretch where something like 90% of the world's oil tankers move thru. iran has missiles which can sink tankers clog up hormuz. 

= world oil price quadruples
2314 2018-07-03 19:02:41 Strict ass  RT @CJ_Urbane: All that cocoa butter, oil and shit women be wearing gets on my leather in the whip in the summertime and I don’t like that shit cuh. Gonna have to implement a pants policy.
2315 2018-07-03 19:02:39 You might as well move to Australia then, because I damn sure am not paying 45%, plus a Medicare levy of 2% in income tax to cover you medical costs.  That is socialized medicine and I am not going to wait for a procedure. Ocare made it worse and McCain flipped the middle finger.
2316 2018-07-03 19:02:38 Really interesting analysis, thanks! How do you think the oil companies' rebranding themselves as energy companies, and going hard on wind farms etc. will change this outcome?
2317 2018-07-03 19:02:06 failure to pay the outstanding cash call balance may result in the #Pentanova (defaulting party) losing it's 39% working interest. 

If they lose argentina, they lose the heavy oil belt working interest at play.

How this gets done is make or break for PNO shares.
2318 2018-07-03 19:02:05 Yeah except even today members of that fan group were bringing up how bad it was that the oil didnt listen to the scouts in 2012 to take Murray over yakupov and listened to Katz instead (allegedly)...so it's like they really just hate hall and barzal for some reason
2319 2018-07-03 19:02:00 My favorite things to oil, ranked:
1) Fried food
2) Cars
3) Muscles
2320 2018-07-03 19:01:44 Pour vegetable oil in it.
2321 2018-07-03 19:01:39 Easy. Oklahoma is a place where every level of govt, including the courts, is run by Republicans, which in Oklahoma means the oil & gas industry. With the recent boom in fracking a lot of people have gotten rich & the rest have been ignored. He’s used to doing what he wants.
2322 2018-07-03 19:01:37 "Calculated treachery" The inconsistent and shifting sands of US/West support over the years leads to the conclusion that war death & destruction is the objective.  Kurds as mentioned, Hussein vs Kuwait, Iran/Iraq etc.  Theft of oil revenues is the result.
2323 2018-07-03 19:01:35 I’m pissed TSA made me chalk my cocoa butter, suntan lotion, & coconut oil... they was all full 
2324 2018-07-03 19:01:21 Put a bit of oil in it

2327 2018-07-03 19:00:31 Us atheists? His fundamentalist Christian beliefs are not the de rigueur of present Christian theology. Ken Ham is a snake oil salesman, that takes advantage of people and communities, by using their faith against them. His ideas are dangerous and have far reaching implications.

We have " moderate D's" running in red dist, socialists running in blue. Just tailoring message, no real beliefs behind them?
2330 2018-07-03 19:00:23 And he’s a so called expert in oil production !!!!

2336 2018-07-03 19:00:00 In April 2008
#US oil imports reached 10 million barrels per day
#China to 3.5 million barrels

In April 2018
Us oil imports reached 6 million barrels per day
China  to 9.6 million barrels per day

These figures summarize what happens in the oil world !

2337 2018-07-03 18:59:47 I bet @PostMalone smells like expensive beard oil and garlic from chicken parm
2338 2018-07-03 18:59:43 A hot date lol I’m gonna stop by insha’Allah after I’m done getting my oil change
2339 2018-07-03 18:59:38 Do morons think they are being clever with this "people who care about the environment should use NO oil" argument? Homey we are protesting a massive increase in dilbit exports, not the domestic use of oil! my god man!
2340 2018-07-03 18:59:30 Thanks Al. Just wondering if Iran exports through loopholes like Iraq will that bring oil price down even more.. too may moving parts just need to do some Libya whatifs
2341 2018-07-03 18:59:28 Hot oil treatments was the best thing ever invented...What’s a perm again?
2342 2018-07-03 18:59:21 When you massage your scalp with lavender oil midday. 
2343 2018-07-03 18:59:11 He gonna oil change my whole car lol
2344 2018-07-03 18:58:56 I am glad to see the management at Folk Oil recognize discrimination when they saw it and took proper action.
I do hope the boy in the hospital is going well. Perhaps the former employee has found employment that suits her temperment what ever that may be.
2345 2018-07-03 18:58:51 There's an exquisite irony in the timing of this announcement given that oil prices are going up because of a lack of production & oil reserves are moving more rapidly around the world to depletion. In the meantime, does the Ford Regime plan any sort of assault on #ClimateChange?
2346 2018-07-03 18:58:47 Switched to coconut oil a few years ago; my skin has never looked better, having always been prone to spots and general blotchiness.
2347 2018-07-03 18:58:40 OILとGOLDやっぱり0.1か0.2枚だけでもLしとくべきだったな。

GOLDは1240未満のところでLするか迷ったけど入らず、US30にSで入ったら、逆指値刈られた。

OILは0時ぐらいに73切ったとき、入ろうかと思ったけど、結局入らなかった。
2348 2018-07-03 18:58:38 I don't know about that. The Middle East has had civilizations much older than the USA. Iran had an oil industry before the US long before the US decided to overthrow their democratically elected prime minsters. I'm criticizing this unquestioned patriotism.
2349 2018-07-03 18:58:19 Kangin get confused about what to teach Kyu,
because once Kyu incorrectly entered oil when
cooking a simple ham.

2411 2018-07-03 18:50:31 Well dumbass. 1st tar is a man made product from petroleum distillation. It doesn't exist naturally. 2nd the oil is in the sand. Even on the surface. After its mined the site is restored to boreal forest only now the oil is no longer there. The land is better than before.
2412 2018-07-03 18:50:28 Got my oil changed while I sat in my car, and they offered me a cold bottle of water while I waited.. I felt like a princess lmao
2413 2018-07-03 18:50:27 They pump regardless of price, the pump jacks keep going, larger derricks slow down, but that's irrelevant, point is the U.S economy/consumers cannot handle domestic only oil prices.

Therefore you're forced to import & have no choice, so buy American is a failed economic policy.

2490 2018-07-03 18:42:59 OK Americans, isn’t it amazing how oil company cost increase coincides with the July 4th holiday.  If that’s not gauging all Americans I don’t know what is.
Thanks Mr Oil CEO.

2492 2018-07-03 18:42:53 It is just pure incitement, Turkana leaders who've been seen propagating violence should be arrested. Oil is a national resource not county property

The state owns a successful bank and grain elevators.  They are working on an oil refinery.  Corporate farming is not allowed.  These are socialist concepts.

وجهة نظري:
1- WTI  سعره يعتمد على المخزونات النفطية الامريكية, حيث ان الفتره هذي المخزونات الامركية هبطت بقوة وتقلص الفرق
2- اللي شبه متأكد منه هو, الامريكان هم يحددون السعر, كما طلب ترامب قبل ايام.

2518 2018-07-03 18:39:49 The government should be considerate and extremely careful on this oil issue. Turkana people must be accorded their appropriate cut of the pie and be assured of security and a conducive environment to do business with the government

2619 2018-07-03 18:28:26 better them than us. what you're claiming doesn't rationalize what's going on in Alberta. Canada's role isn't bending over for foreign oil corps. while they crap all over our environment all in the name of profit. there's no ethics in what they're doing to our beautiful country
2620 2018-07-03 18:28:19 Don't care what the design looks like - just bring back 'a glass and a half of full milk' in each bar, instead of palm oil and other disgusting substances. Flavour just isn't right anymore. ( I should know - I remember the small bars I bought for thrupence in the 50s!)
2621 2018-07-03 18:28:12 Turkana residents are entitled to the right ‘share of the cake’ regarding the newly found oil exploits in their county. The right share will diffuse tension,foster unity and spur growth within the county and beyond

2641 2018-07-03 18:25:34 Mine was at $2.89 for weeks but it's dropped down to about $2.49.
Blame OPEC, they purposely held oil production down in order to inflate the price of oil since America upped production.
2642 2018-07-03 18:25:15 Twas alright but not great, my accompanying salads & new potatoes were grand though. (mixed leaves, parmesan shavings, fresh basil & olive oil)
2643 2018-07-03 18:25:11 I had a 1988 Chevy Cavalier when I was a much younger man.  It had a small oil leak that smoked the shit out of the motor. As I drove down the highway, it looked like one of those wells that Saddam had set on fire in the first Gulf War (1992).  Prolly something like that.

2696 2018-07-03 18:21:08 @PhilipHammondUK please read this article as my MP. @MelJStride is woefully incorrect. If you’re going to bankrupt a swathe of doctors, nurses, oil & gas, IT contractors then it should be based on fact & discussed in parliament. Introduce loan charge from 2017 not retrospectively

2710 2018-07-03 18:19:22 When and where did this sudden concern for Muslims and Persians come from?

2712 2018-07-03 18:19:17 If we are energy dependant why do we continue to allow OPEC to set our prices. Everyday Americans living from paycheck to paycheck need lower gas prices.  While big oil continues to show huge profits. Something is dirty wrong here.

2726 2018-07-03 18:17:29 Their manufacture remains 100% dependent on fossil fuels however, so the price can only fall if oil remains cheap.

2730 2018-07-03 18:16:56 And the trains that carry oil? Pipelines are many many times safer than trains. Are you monitoring from a boat or plane? Solar powered?  How did you get to the airstrip or marina? EV? And the electricity to power the EV generated how? And your dwelling heated with?

2750 2018-07-03 18:15:28 By the way, oil is not sharply lower--as we speak, it is at 74 bucks, up 16 cents--considering the last few years, 74 bucks looks really good to oil investors
2751 2018-07-03 18:15:28 Just a little oil pipeline talk among friends. 

Do they each get a cut?

2754 2018-07-03 18:15:13 Well, they probably were getting the benefit of credit card points and other loyalty rewards. It’s basically an oil rig for a motocross arena situation.
2755 2018-07-03 18:15:10 Definitely an oil tanker
2756 2018-07-03 18:14:56 hope they can swim as well as they repel. 
Oil tankers should just keep steaming out of port and make the protesters get out of the way.  It is not responsible to have a ship try to evade hitting a protester and perhaps take out a bridge.
2757 2018-07-03 18:14:50 woohoo! That is pretty much exactly what i do with preen oil! minus the vectors.
2758 2018-07-03 18:14:43 After an ages I put too much oil in my hair :) Feeling bit relief
2759 2018-07-03 18:14:37 Nobody is victimising a group but imagine cows coming to each crops you have laboured for over the months or years.
Cows should be ranched to avoid problems in Nigeria. They're destroying farm lands.
You know the truth, speak it
2760 2018-07-03 18:14:27 They don't. Its oil and water.
2761 2018-07-03 18:14:08 Thanks. 

The world uses a lot of oil and products made from oil. Many countries have oil (including us). The oil needs to be moved around from where it is harvested to where it is refined and used.

What is there to protest? That we don’t move to caves?

2766 2018-07-03 18:13:37 I just went into a “car doctor” ( i dunno the name so yeah) and this family walks in at the same time as us. As they are changing our car’s oil, they watch a YouTube video of a guy doing no- handed pushups. Then they proceeded to attempt the stunt and fail miserably.

2771 2018-07-03 18:13:24 The place where you get your oil changed at 1 pm on a Tuesday while a soccer game plays on the tv, magazines on the table in the corner, older lady quietly reading the newspaper, dead middle of summer, ac and ceiling fan on... this is the most relaxed I've ever been
2772 2018-07-03 18:13:00 Where is the capitalism in Nigeria? Dangote’s government created advantages? Alakija’s government gifted oil wells? Do you people even know anything about this country?
2773 2018-07-03 18:12:50 It shouldnt take 2 and a half hours for niggas to change oil like wtf i coulda did this myself
2774 2018-07-03 18:12:50 Cows that are meant to be ranched from destroying other people's farmland. Those fighting against the Fulani Herdsmen do you think they just want to fight or feel like? What is hard in not doing to others what they don't like?

2780 2018-07-03 18:12:20 The culture of consumption is also different. Texas oil money is a different attitude than Saudi. Zuck tech money is different than Microsoft. There are rich actors who are very kind, and some who are raging assholes.

2786 2018-07-03 18:11:17 Yeah castor oil or fish oil will induce the labor
2787 2018-07-03 18:11:09 Eco nuts refer to our blessed OIL sands as Tar Sands as a way of criticism....but they’re good with OPEC!
2788 2018-07-03 18:11:06 And so that's a violent statement. Such statement should be condemned and u know it. What a fellow say most times is a reflection of whom he or what he's capable of doing.
Cow over human with the narrative "USELESS"
Never knew any human can call kill a fellow cause of cows

2791 2018-07-03 18:10:49 There are only 5 million people in Norway - same as South Carolina - with huge state oil reserves that funds a large portion of their social programs. 86% of the pop is native Norwegian - very homogenous. That model won't work for 327 million people in a really diverse nation.

There are plenty of alternatives. 
Why aren’t you listening to potential consumers??
I boycotted all your products when I learned the horror of Palm Oil and there is no sustainable source.
Take note: No Palm Oil is acceptable

Our Gov officials visit these places yet they dont have sense.
2811 2018-07-03 18:09:20 A lot of the change in trade deficit was importing less oil. People rarely  talked about that part, just China.

2815 2018-07-03 18:08:57 I assume that is based on either current production or current proven reserves.  Obviously Atlantic margin and Clyde oil reserves not yet proven would increase that percentage

2817 2018-07-03 18:08:39 Ironically, tar sands polls more favourably than oil sands. So I always call them oil sands. Plus, oil over use is the real problem regardless of whether it comes from tar sands or not.

2819 2018-07-03 18:08:34 Cheaper oil = more extra money = more charity = less starving African children. Glad to see you think gorillas are worth the same (if not more). Who's the racist now?

2832 2018-07-03 18:06:38 It's simply because there aren't enough helicopters in the world to drive down costs. They're running very old school engines that just eat oil because certification is so costly. It will all be cheaper when drones take over our airways haha

2891 2018-07-03 18:00:01 Duh.....Norway is rich and happy because it didn't have a Tory government selling off its oil and other national assets from under it!  Even so, to trade with the EU, it has to sit and wait for new regulations (on which it has no say) to be faxed across every week.
2892 2018-07-03 18:00:01 I know that pre-pooing can help your curls hold on to moisture and I'm familiar with all the benefits, but I was skeptical that my Type 2c waves would thrive under all that oil.

2901 2018-07-03 17:58:28 There is no evidence that anyone at the NY Times has lied. If you view the free press through the lens of Trump then there is no hope for you. There is no value in being told what to think. Make up your own mind. That way you won't get taken in by snake oil salesman.
2902 2018-07-03 17:58:26 there’s olive oil in my eYES
2903 2018-07-03 17:58:17 Hey @bjnovak did you just change my oil?
2904 2018-07-03 17:58:08 Here r the POLAR OPPOSITE world views that CANT last/stand the test of time: Big oil vs. environmentalists; poor vs rich; black vs. white; national vs. immigrant, big vs small govt/taxes; north vs south, blue vs red states; white vs blue collar; pro war vs pro diplomacy & peace..
2905 2018-07-03 17:58:05 Question how much more will be left after destroying what mother nature has bestowed on us, nothing, oil drilling destroy our ecosystem, but major oil companies don't give a dam, they don't clean up 100 %after oil spills & never will. It's impossible.

2910 2018-07-03 17:57:23 Moms these days love coconut oil. Stretch marks? Coconut oil. Baby have dry skin? Coconut oil. Has lil’ one been really fussy lately? Have you tried dousing their entire body in coconut oil?!
2911 2018-07-03 17:57:23 A good example is the Trans Mtn protest here in BC. Many don't know the difference between the rejected LNG line + proposed twinning of the existing cross provincial oil line. They protest as soon as they hear "pipeline", and don't recognize that oil makes up nearly 3% of our GDP

2921 2018-07-03 17:56:26 Exactly 49% of the price goes to levies meaning our price is just R8 a litre. Hence am saying crude oil is not the only determining fact like we being told.

2942 2018-07-03 17:54:38 ALMOND OIL
-Almond oil is a great natural ingredient that is very beneficial for the delicate skin around your eyes. Regular usage of almond oil will help fade your under eye circles. In addition to almond oil, you can use vitamin E oil to eliminate dark circles under the eyes.

2958 2018-07-03 17:53:14 Why did you say "oil"?

You do realize where the gas and motor oil in your car come from, right? The "oil" in your car is not the same as oil that is taken from the ground. Both gas and motor oil are petroleum products.

2968 2018-07-03 17:51:34 I'd sub out regular tomatoes for our oven died tomatoes that cooked in olive oil & garlic. Super juicy all flavor.
2969 2018-07-03 17:51:30 It's all about oil. We routinely give money to countries with a lot of oil to change their policies, to upgrade their infrastructure, to go into their governments pockets. All for oil.

2977 2018-07-03 17:50:58 OPEC just agreed to lessen restrictions on oil production, so there will be a reduction at the pumps. Trump's already claiming credit for this, so I have no doubt Ford will also try to claim credit for the lower rates and he'll take no active measures to reduce prices further.

2991 2018-07-03 17:48:45 Not major contributors in my view. Levies can stay the same the whole year but fuel price can go up and down monthly. This is due to the price of Brent crude oil and the weakness of rand against the US dollar.

3021 2018-07-03 17:46:29 Don't accutane! It's evil. There are oils that shouldn't break you out. Avoid mineral oil, of course, but grapeseed, squalene, and jojoba shouldn't clog pores. Oil emulsifies oil. It seems counterintuitive, but it really works. Hazelnut oil is a great dry oil, but it can be $$.
3022 2018-07-03 17:46:26 For years Alaska Oil Tankers sail right by Vancouver’s Coast in Canadian Waters & Greenpeace does nothing. This proves Greenpeace is funded by USA money. They only oppose Canadian oil WHY? Think about it Alaska Oil is free to pass by them & No Protest. Who pays Greenpeace & Why ?
3023 2018-07-03 17:46:09 No need for any of that. Just go to Rudy's. You will get plenty of oil in the brisket and you'll walk out smelling like BBQ.
3024 2018-07-03 17:46:08 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, but enforce our laws.
3025 2018-07-03 17:46:06 "used it for actual deep-sea oil drilling and exploration."

Or did they?????
3026 2018-07-03 17:46:02 I was watching a YouTube video of an oil painter sharing her process. Her painting, being done in the classical realism style, is fantastic. The sad part, some dufus said, “just take a photo”. Why do so many people feel the need to act like imbeciles?
3027 2018-07-03 17:46:01 Wheatgerm oil is also very nice, but I don't know if you can buy it easily here. (It's sold everywhere in France.)
3028 2018-07-03 17:45:59 I just watched an interview with Trump supporters who have watched pipelines being run through the crayfish habitat they need for their jobs. Oil companies destroyed the area, did not repair the flow of water, now it’s a stagnant swamp. And coal sludge can be dumped into streams!
3029 2018-07-03 17:45:56 The little feast j and a had was 80% percent olive oil, parmesan cheese, and salt and 20% quinoa
3030 2018-07-03 17:45:50 And yet they are starting to make mass production work which scares the crap out of Big Oil and Autos.  And, IMHO, Musk is spot on looking to do a Tesla pickup truck and I'd suggest before the Semi.  The specs/torque would be unmatched by anything out there.
3031 2018-07-03 17:45:46 Mix 11 lbs hot dogs with 2 quarts venison. Adorn with  Olive Oil. Slice into 1 inch pieces. Serve in 3 inch slices
3032 2018-07-03 17:45:44 Setting powder? And/or an oil controlling foundation?
3033 2018-07-03 17:45:41 Tobi’s not here so I actually had to buy cooking oil

3037 2018-07-03 17:45:24 anyone know how to change oil for a merc? ain’t tryna pay 100 for an oil change lol
3038 2018-07-03 17:45:24 Fry onion on some grease/oil, when it's translucent, add pork steaks (thin, evenly sized), fry on sll sides on low heat and add water occasionally to avoid burning. When it's soft and close to being done, add sliced pork liver, evenly sized. Fry for few minutes color on all sides
3039 2018-07-03 17:45:17 I used a new face wash and put bio oil on my stretch marks and I honestly feel like whole new bitch
3040 2018-07-03 17:45:17 In the area where we are there's a huge of people have lost their jobs when Oil companies saw an opportunity to cut costs and lay off people. I can't speak for unemployment levels in your area due to the fact you hide behind a pseudonym while hurling insults and lies, you liar
3041 2018-07-03 17:45:14 People who produce, sell, and use #CBD #hemp oil for therapeutic purposes are doing so legally. When CBD oil is derived from hemp, it is #legal in all 50 states, given the proper permissions.

3043 2018-07-03 17:45:07 Ingredient Watch: Eating Propyl Alcohol this July? Used as a synthetic flavoring, it's made from natural gas and fusel oil.

3046 2018-07-03 17:44:54 C’mon mate you have multiple sponsorship deals with many Abu Dhabi companies to generate the revenue you’ve needed to stay off ffp radar in recent years..pretty sure that’ll come from oil money. Didn’t the Spanish clubs want you investigated recently because of the way city group
3047 2018-07-03 17:44:53 Anyone tried magnesium oil for muscle and joint pain? Is there any benefits to topical application? Is it magnesium that helps or the massaging it in? @UKRunChat #ukrunchat
3048 2018-07-03 17:44:48 The oil man got me for $20 for oils  . But I did cop 4 of them for $20 when he was selling them $20 a pop!!

3050 2018-07-03 17:44:23 Put 100% lavender oil or eucalyptus oil on the shower walls while you’re taking a hot shower. It’s a great stress reliever. I did it last night and slept like a baby 

Thought I’d share lol
3051 2018-07-03 17:44:19 We need to change the way people talk about the oilsands. There are people out there that think that the oil and the sand are not separated and moving through pipelines in a tar like substance. It is not.
3052 2018-07-03 17:44:09 I'm at the dealership getting an oil change and I'm looking at the new cars and I'm depressed
3053 2018-07-03 17:44:05 Use coconut oil to remove it
3054 2018-07-03 17:44:05 Is that you in the red @Heid_oil ?
3055 2018-07-03 17:44:03 風が吹いてる
3056 2018-07-03 17:43:53 In fact,  most of the parts that are in solar panels and wind turbines are made from oil and natural gas.
3057 2018-07-03 17:43:52 Very. And unlike olive oil, doesn't make you smell like salad. :-)
3058 2018-07-03 17:43:47 OMG YES THAT IS EPIC!!! And he’s like “Thank you for the oil my skin was a little dry” SLAYYYY
3059 2018-07-03 17:43:28 @freshii why don’t you guys offer Keto coffee (butter + coffee + coconut/mct oil)?  Seems on brand and you already serve coffee.
3060 2018-07-03 17:43:26 An oil change is not $16 lol
3061 2018-07-03 17:43:24 i just cleaned up my brows and curled my lashes rn and goddamn, thank you castor oil
3062 2018-07-03 17:43:23 John was a savage they boiled that man in hot oil and they couldnt kill him so they sent him away thats the kind of power the church is supposed to live in
3063 2018-07-03 17:43:13 Literally feel like I’m trying outside with this coconut oil on

3065 2018-07-03 17:43:00 I am coming to the Woodlands to deliver around Hughes Landing at 2:30pm. If you need soap, beard oil, lotion, soap, bath salts or wax tarts, I can meet you in that area!!! message me!

3069 2018-07-03 17:42:14 A pea-sized amount of baby oil can act as a shine hair serum before dashing out the door.
3070 2018-07-03 17:42:01 In this matter, even representatives wld not help.

"Oil is dug from location A making resources unfit for survival and channelled to location B", or how do you think a typical ND sees this?

3072 2018-07-03 17:41:54 Aren’t you suppose to be changing someone’s oil
3073 2018-07-03 17:41:54 It's not just the Oil companies. We play a role in protecting the environment as well. Especially since the corrupt leader of the EPA doesn't give a shit. Scott Pruitt only cares about enriching himself. Sad.
3074 2018-07-03 17:41:54 Every candidate that ran Republican in the oil as homa primary quoted trump, praised trump claimed they were a business man, "just like trump" and by God, they all won. Sickening.
3075 2018-07-03 17:41:49 I've had 4 surgeries in local hospital. while you're waiting you are subjected to Sunrise and the BS from Kochie. I'm riled up even before I'm even into a hospital gown. He  said #1 place for 1st time WA homebuyers was Kwinana, no mention miles from Perth no or oil refinery.
3076 2018-07-03 17:41:46 Of course he does! They have to discuss oil deals, the nuclear reactors in Saudi, $ laundering. Trump wants to thank him for 2016, & they need to plot 2020! Plus, Trump needs advice about creating his dictatorships! He better be charged for all his crimes after all this shit!
3077 2018-07-03 17:41:39 I need to start wearing a fucking snow suit or something everytime I get an oil change bc I'm sick of creepy greasy men staring at me bc I'm wearing shorts
3078 2018-07-03 17:41:17 I've been living on r/antimlm so religiously that I desperately want an essential oil distributor to slide into my DMs and try to get me to drink their snake oil so I can retaliate
3079 2018-07-03 17:41:15 Why did you take money from a Russian oil billionaire?
3080 2018-07-03 17:41:03 There just admitted that the "other areas" oil should have been on Scotland's account.
So that will be the end of that.
3081 2018-07-03 17:41:01 Coconut oil is lovely.
3082 2018-07-03 17:40:46 Requsting @themagnificant to bring coconut oil
3083 2018-07-03 17:40:43 I dry the chilies and use as flakes. The seeds and the white membranes I put in a bottle and add olive oil - sometimes with garlic. Gets enough of the heat and can be used for salads, dressings and frying. (Some seeds saved for next year, of course.)
3084 2018-07-03 17:40:40 if gdx $25 and gdxj $36 when gold reaches $1370 it is a false rally and 2019 is the year. If gdx hits $30 when gold at $1370 then we have lift off.

Bull case will follow oil chart. A leg up to $1350/overbought - small decrease to $1335-40 then right thru $1370
3085 2018-07-03 17:40:32 @CBDOilSolutions yes!
Have had amazing positive results using Canna Cannabinol vs hemp. I too have a question. Is there a molecular difference between the two?                                    I am also researching neuropathic pain and cbd, with Cannabis oil.
3086 2018-07-03 17:40:31 There is AMPLE evidence that capitalist economic systems are more efficient than central governance models...yes. The starkest example is US/USSR. Venezuela - look at oil production before and after Chavez seized oil company assets.
3087 2018-07-03 17:40:25 エルザー　何怒ってんだよー？
3088 2018-07-03 17:40:22 You are not my favorite but this time I have to ask you that We need to know who were officials? Since they use our public funds and oil money to stay there.
3089 2018-07-03 17:40:20 This is home/dorm room variant, the kind that you'd eat out would most likely be buttered or at least sprayed with some oil
3090 2018-07-03 17:40:17 Agak agak kalau bio oil sapu dalam hati , hilang tak parut ?

3093 2018-07-03 17:40:07 Agree, it is time to stop subsidizing Crony Big Oil and the Crony Banks.  Bring the troops Home.

3104 2018-07-03 17:39:09 Where you find an oil change for $16??  Oil itself is $40+ plus a $10ish Oil Filter
3105 2018-07-03 17:39:08 So what's a non mineral alternative to baby oil for moisturising after shower, tell me? Who has tried and found a good? Affordable please.
3106 2018-07-03 17:38:55 she thought a tattoo meant it was forever? zayns chest is soon gonna look like an oil spill
3107 2018-07-03 17:38:55 Yup, that cheese is fatty enough for it to release a lot of oil when it melts.

The more adventurous, would add a dab of ketchup in the middle, it would usually reach near fusion temperatures, it squirts with an area of effect of 3d6 of damage to anyone in direct line of sight.
3108 2018-07-03 17:38:51 God don't do that! Always please go to an independent shop with real technicians! Oil changes gone bad by stupid kids are the #1 problem in our industry!
3109 2018-07-03 17:38:49 Oil change
3110 2018-07-03 17:38:31 Funnily enough, I was offered an analogous deal in the oil industy. Didn't go. Sod living out there 
3111 2018-07-03 17:38:24 ADAM's the ultimate score, kid. No more grifts. No more scams. A monopoly on ADAM makes Standard Oil look like the Piggly Wiggly.
3112 2018-07-03 17:38:19 I get full synthetic oil changes every 10,000 miles I always thought getting a oil change every 3,000 miles was stupid.. that’s like every 1-2 months for me
3113 2018-07-03 17:38:13 It is good to transition to renewables,  but we still have to get oil and natural gas to create the products we use like cell phones, cars, bicycles and much more.   These renewables like solar or wind only create electricity,  but not products.
3114 2018-07-03 17:38:09 I am appalled regarding the killing of such beautiful Gorillas & destroying a extraordinary national park, for oil first you destroy the ocean's then Indian land & list go on just for money with no respect to what mother nature has bestowed on us, never ends.
3115 2018-07-03 17:38:02 Mix apple cider vinegar and water, apply with a washcloth. Wait for it to dry and then put coconut oil on

We sunk the Goethals and Outerbridge into Arthur Kill, and we've barricaded the Verrazano.  The 22nd Douchestaffel of Staten Island shout taunts at us, but once they run out of tiki torch oil, the Shaolin Skirmish will be won.

3122 2018-07-03 17:37:35 I actually got up at 5:30 this morning  only to shower because it looked like someone poured olive oil on my head.
3123 2018-07-03 17:37:17 No we are not. What we are fed up with is a U.K. Government which has broken our trust. 1/3 of a Billion stolen by Gove and Crown Estates and god knows how much oil revenue through the other regions. We want U.K. government out of Scotland now!
3124 2018-07-03 17:37:16 Thanks to spilling my now melted coconut oil moisturiser all over me, I now smell like a gone off bounty bar

3126 2018-07-03 17:37:09 I really wanna love “lovely” by Billie Eilish and Khalid but the intro to the chorus/beginning of the chorus reminds me so much of oil spill from the food truck episode of Bob’s Burgers
3127 2018-07-03 17:37:09 Huh nobody hanging from the confederation bridge  on the east coast to protest Saudi/Iran/Venezuela/Libyas oil ... I guess foreign NGO,s only pay for sabotage on the west coast ?

3128 2018-07-03 17:37:09 US doesn’t import oil from either of these countries.

3130 2018-07-03 17:36:57 if you put flavored soybean oil aka coffeemate in your coffee y’all are weird and probably into other weird shit too

3140 2018-07-03 17:35:47 Trump's trade war with Iran is as destructive to the U.S, economically as it is to Iran.  We need  to keep the oil supply to U.S. stable.  Fail to do that and we are looking again at gas prices back at 5 or 6 dollars a gallon.  A senseless trade war,
3141 2018-07-03 17:35:35 Yes,that's the origin of everything, 90% of the stories I've come across is from going to the guys house,if you want to kill a snake you cut its head off
3142 2018-07-03 17:35:34 Collins already declared she is a believer that Roe w prevail w the next SCOTUS. Murkowski, forget about her. Her Daddy was a Repub., he put her in office, literally speaking. She sold out AL for oil, she’ll sell out her gender for a song...forget about the prayer.
3143 2018-07-03 17:35:14 Kilode!? To buy ticket and fly down to your city and use brake oil to help you clean it sef should be cheaper.

3146 2018-07-03 17:35:03 You do not solve the oil dispute in Turkana South & East by arresting representatives of the people.

But my skin really is like the BP oil spill though lol
3149 2018-07-03 17:34:21 That's real bad ! Maybe you can make a better deal and tell them to bring some of the money back preferably gold or oil .
3150 2018-07-03 17:34:15 Coconut oil cures all. 
3151 2018-07-03 17:34:15 In #Ballynahinch: Update: Motorists are being asked to adjust their speed after the oil spill which is affecting Belfast Road and the one way system on Harmony Way is down to one lane, Windmill Street, Main Street and High Street are all effected as well.
3152 2018-07-03 17:34:14 OK reps really don't give a rats A$$ about Pruitt, only his boss, the oil & gas industry that keeps them all in office. Right @TomColeOK04 right @RepMullin right @RepRussell right @RepFrankLucas

3169 2018-07-03 17:32:19 @RagheeHorner oil, was listen to @PlattsOil and I noted Venezuela is in bigger trouble. Now there is talk of told collapse of oil infrastructure.
3170 2018-07-03 17:32:11 Yes. It would actually go at the end of your routine because it has Squalane, which is an oil. Very light oil, but still an oil nonetheless.
3171 2018-07-03 17:32:11 Yeah, but from now on I'll wear my MAGA hat into Walmart
3172 2018-07-03 17:32:10 As both a olive oil lover & someone who was homeschooled, I have to ponder how I feel about this.
3173 2018-07-03 17:32:01 Directions: 

- Apply the oil/serum/gel to your eyelashes before you go to bed with a clean mascara wand. In the morning wash it off with warm water; repeat daily for 2-3 months. (Do this for serums if they don't have directions for it online or in the package you receive it in.)
3174 2018-07-03 17:31:58 Yeah if u wanna park a mile away.  Maybe for ppl who want exercise.

3191 2018-07-03 17:30:19 I am literally a hummus and pita, chips and salsa, olive oil and bread vegan. That’s it. That’s what i live off.
3192 2018-07-03 17:30:14 Find any oil underneath the arch?
3193 2018-07-03 17:30:07 Thank you. And they are fully functional oil lamps just as the Romans made them.
3194 2018-07-03 17:30:04 If there are no allergic concerns may want to try clove oil. Its pretty much the only aspect of holistic medicine with which I have had actual relief. Smoothies, meal replacement drinks, yogurt. Anything that can fit through a straw.  Best of luck!
3195 2018-07-03 17:30:03 Dear mother and father,
The organic garlic hummus has spoiled in the heat.  We will be reduced to subsisting on our pita chips dry until we can resupply at the nearest Whole Foods. And it may yet be weeks before we have enough artisan beard oil for the men. #secondcivilwarletters
3196 2018-07-03 17:30:02 That sounds right! Cheese in between two pieces of bread, all grilled together. But like, you just put it in the panini with no oil or spray or anything? Totally dry bread?
3197 2018-07-03 17:29:52 As a follow up, olive oil preferred for cooking over butter or either is fine?
3198 2018-07-03 17:29:50 You like this because you have enough oil for yourself and believe that no one else deserves any. Good going, oil hoarder.
3199 2018-07-03 17:29:46 I laugh when people  say we are rich country, Texas pump 4million barrel of oil per day and we pump 1.8m barrel per day and Texas is not even richest state in US. Note oil is 90% foreign exchange earner for Nigeria.
3200 2018-07-03 17:29:43 I tend to agree -  the effects were bloody obvious (and well known in some circles) even if the "science" was not established.  Right back to failures of coconut oil for fattening cattle.

3248 2018-07-03 17:23:54 It's not an article.  It's a scan from the pages of an encyclopedia that explains that they have long been called tar sands, and that it was the oil industry that lobbied to change it.

3250 2018-07-03 17:23:45 Stan: Utopia (in it's true meaning) is the promises of big government, having nothing to do with "big" oil, but having everything to do with big government. No oil company has ever forced you to buy their product.

We'd recommend for people who have given up on Prismas to get a similar competitor like Staedtler/Derwent/Dick Blick/etc, even Timeless Creations gets decent reviews.
3303 2018-07-03 17:18:06 Is there a lake with an island in the middle, some oil drums, sticky back plastic and an old washing up bottle. That’s how to solve Brexit.

3305 2018-07-03 17:18:00 I see entitlements like corporate welfare of Oil Companies and the Big Corporations are people, they get all the advantages of a persons rights but none of the drawbacks. Example would be Bankruptcies they can do that individuals can't.

3307 2018-07-03 17:17:45 Nearly all of Venezuela’s GDP is tied directly to the oil markets (nothing to do with socialism), human life expectancy across the globe has seen a steady increase over the past multiple decades, so Venezuela is not special in this regard (1/2)

3314 2018-07-03 17:16:52 When I think of the hours I spent sizzling myself in baby oil. I’m so lucky not to be an entire malignant mole with legs right now.
3315 2018-07-03 17:16:42 Want to know something about Lex Luthor? He's bald like Mr.Clean. He uses baby oil to shine his bald head.

3321 2018-07-03 17:16:11 Wait, I thought it wasn't working for Norway and they're becoming capitalist?  Which is it?  Also, how does it work for Sweden and Denmark without the oil income?  Finland? The Netherlands? Canada?
3322 2018-07-03 17:16:08 It seems that #Trump is serious on #iran 's sanctions, also #Rohani  threats oil market in #PersianGulf , first punch by us, waiting for mullah turn!
All signs for oil rates increase.

3324 2018-07-03 17:16:07 We had our hot water heater replaced.  I wanted to go with a hybrid electric/oil but was convinced a traditional one would be the best bet.  So far, no issues.

3330 2018-07-03 17:15:45 Today I've learned you can use WD-40 as engine oil in a pinch. What about vegetable oil? Well, lets watch the video and found out!
3331 2018-07-03 17:15:24 #oott Oil supply is like monetary supply.  First u max out existing credit, then leverage for more, spend that without changing habits, then you hit the wall. Crude will do the same at these $'s. $ must go up, or will just stimulate more demand, weaken supply. Talk /= reality.
3332 2018-07-03 17:15:23 I hadn’t changed the oil in a while and when I came back from Modesto, my car stopped wanting to accelerate letting me know it needed oil. Got stranded for a bit and when I was finally able to get it going again and to the nearest gas station, it started to make this loud noise

3335 2018-07-03 17:15:12 I regret never taking fibers or ceramics classes in college because I had this prentious idea that art has to be giant oil paintings and nothing else. Traditional crafts rule
3336 2018-07-03 17:15:09 Small error: "As promised, Premier Doug Ford is abandoning cap and trade to lower gas taxes that will go directly to the oil companies instead of consumers".

3343 2018-07-03 17:14:22 This heat is the perfect time for me to test out setting powder all over the face b4 foundation to control oil
3344 2018-07-03 17:14:14 “Tar Sands” was the name of the area in Alberta and the product into the 60s. Marketers  pushed to get “oil sands” to catch on bc of how much cleaner it sounds. Change the name is just lipstick on a pig
3345 2018-07-03 17:14:12 With some peppers from Iran, oil price explosion around the place !
3346 2018-07-03 17:14:08 I’m not good in the heat I’m just not designed for it! But I’ve found @breazeallergy vapour oil to help with my hay fever thank goodness!

3352 2018-07-03 17:13:36 Growth and development are two different things, similar in some aspects. They sold 1400 billion $ oil. Comparing to what they could do with one tenth of this money, they have done nothing noteworthy.

But I agree about oil/laziness relation.

How will we ever recover?
3362 2018-07-03 17:12:57 I'd like to live in your utopian world, big oil is in charge now and it will reap the rewards on the backs of the common man
3363 2018-07-03 17:12:55 Ok perfect, post them blocking Saudi tankers at Irving on Canada's east coast. Post them blocking the oil trains headed to Quebec.

3369 2018-07-03 17:12:29 I also don’t understand why they decided to put oil and chips on EVERY road
3370 2018-07-03 17:12:19 It’s the worst it’s been in 10 years! Apparently it’s going to be worse next year too! I found the vapour oil from @breazeallergy its been a godsend this summer.
3371 2018-07-03 17:12:19 What did she do this time?

3374 2018-07-03 17:11:23 I don’t qualify anything homemade as junk. Outside food mainly fried and food with high sugar,sodium and oil.
3375 2018-07-03 17:11:21 Not me I just stand there and let the oil burn me
3376 2018-07-03 17:11:21 oh that is another lovely picture, you enjoy !!

3378 2018-07-03 17:11:16 Perhaps the naive Leftys think that's because the Venezuelans are stupid enough to starve. They might not known that Venezuela is an oil rich country in which everyone could live comfortably. Now, if these imbecilic AMERICANS were there it would be another story.
3379 2018-07-03 17:11:15 Although growing Castor Oil Plant (Ricinus communis) in public seems a bit rash as the seeds are extremely poisonous.

3382 2018-07-03 17:10:59 Welp, turns out the only two proven medical uses for clove oil are as analgesic (that the FDA says isn't very effective) and to euthanize fish.

I don't forsee a situation where I would need to euthanize a fish but that's good to know.
3383 2018-07-03 17:10:53 Stauffer’s logic here is asinine. Oil may have to move Puljujarvi because Yamamoto is “knocking on the door?” Connor McDavid is playing with Ty Rattie and a converted C; we can probably squeeze in a couple scoring wingers.
3384 2018-07-03 17:10:36 Friend: Ugh they're playing Franco on the office speakers again

3387 2018-07-03 17:10:12 Dan, not an opinion, facts. Your tweet says Soco was granted right to drill in Virunga, and this is plain inaccurate. Neither Soco nor Quest Oil which you mentioned in other tweets have a license to Block V. These are the facts.

3390 2018-07-03 17:09:53 So Mashutha, mind my spelling, collapsed near VBS. During Russia WC. All when we are still scared of nuclear shit around him. And Oil just jumped, Will continue to jump. Then Cilily would have signed.
3391 2018-07-03 17:09:46 I know what you mean! have you tried the vapour oil from @breazeallergy  its been great for me this summer
3392 2018-07-03 17:09:45 NNPC targets 1bn crude oil reserves yearly – Baru
3393 2018-07-03 17:09:45 The increase of petrol price hits global community not only S.A. OPEC apparently lowered oil production, hence I am failing to understand how SAParliament would reinstate petrol price hike.
3394 2018-07-03 17:09:41 I've literally been putting off to go buy this tom ford oil then when i go to buy it .... ITS OFF THE WEBSITE SO I CANT EVEN SEE IF ITS IN A NEAR STORE

3396 2018-07-03 17:09:30 You can have them if you want! I have no need for them whatsoever...the oil on the other hand....
3397 2018-07-03 17:09:15 Hmmm, nylon ropes and harnesses, plastic helmets, plastic banners, just can't help using those oil products can you?
3398 2018-07-03 17:09:11 Supreme Court has given in to expediency. By not delivering justice to Sharifs and focusing on gasoline prices it has shown its incompetence. Leave oil prices or other daily consumer issues alone, concentrate on your job.
3399 2018-07-03 17:09:02 I was doing actual work while waiting on an oil change. Then I heard about Amazon Prime Day announcement and now I’m wasting time shopping things I don’t need. 
3400 2018-07-03 17:08:55 Crude Price Falls On Saudi Arabia Production Increase, CAD Follows
At the behest of US President Donald Trump, Saudi Arabia has agreed to boost production in an effort to lower oil price...
3401 2018-07-03 17:08:54 That is your, and many people’s problem, you vote for the most popular rather than the most qualified or competent. Hope and Change sounds great coming from a snake oil salesman but does nothing for America.
3402 2018-07-03 17:08:50 Hi Zoe have you tried the vapour oil from @breazeallergy  its been great for me this summer!
3403 2018-07-03 17:08:46 Oil change for the rabbit and an a/c flush makes me very hoppy

3406 2018-07-03 17:08:27 one of my favourite diy masks is moringa powder, spirulina powder, fresh aloe and a lil bit of honey-I also find that tea tree oil helps with acne but dilute it because it’s very strong !!!
3407 2018-07-03 17:08:23 Now that funny.  On the contrary but be sure to “change the oil”
3408 2018-07-03 17:08:21 don’t put any heat on it anymore & stop using products w sulfate. buy all natural. & i also do oil treatments like once a week or every two weeks. you might also need to get it trimmed cause if the ends are dead, it ain’t gone grow.
3409 2018-07-03 17:08:16 Where were you since long time?
3410 2018-07-03 17:07:56 Ewlk I’ll stick to the chicken cheese steaks at my store .. the other food is not oil!

3414 2018-07-03 17:07:47 ...and, if e-cars are only being bought by millionaires in  Norway, Oslo must have the highest concentration of millionaires per capita in the world.

On a somewhat related note, I wonder what AB and NL could learn from Norway with regard to managing an oil economy?
3415 2018-07-03 17:07:43 Am sure u aware HE did not create Vat and petrol as he found it here. He cant come in few months and take out petrol and vat. He did not go there to socialise as he is representing country. If it was his will we would have our own oil, pay no RAF and Fuel Levy etc.
3416 2018-07-03 17:07:40 Really? I don’t see it. But if there is such an “average family”, does their temporary savings pay for escalated gas price, healthcare costs, heating oil costs, etc? You know, all the things you made go up, in addition to the $2 trillion debt increase! That pitch will not fly!

3427 2018-07-03 17:06:43 Trump is just a puppet that golfs, watches Fox News and tweets. Putin does foreign policy. Big oil runs EPA, Federalist society picks judges, Miller does immigration and for profit schools and prisons run the rest. He is bought and paid for.
3428 2018-07-03 17:06:43 ‘Money is the root of all Evil’ couldn’t be more true with the decision to allow oil companies to drill into parts of Virunga. Needs to stop

3451 2018-07-03 17:04:26 Ok but it’s rlly not that bad. Flat iron it and tease the top for some volume and make a messy bob. Also hair growth: hair skin and nail gummies from nature’s bounty helps and taking Olive oil and massaging it in your head while laying upside down just trust me hahaha

3457 2018-07-03 17:03:45 Norway took in billions from oil and has more money than they can spend. They also have strict immigration laws and a population of about 5 million. That’s why it works for them.

- The look on their face when they learn the manufacturer recommended oil chance interval is 10,000 miles is always precious.

- It’s an oil change. I shouldn’t hear the sounds of a hammer on metal from the service bay.

3462 2018-07-03 17:02:57 I'm afraid if reporters like @chrislhayes @maddow @Lawrence @JoyAnnReid don't shine a light on Zinke fast, some of our national park land will be turned over to oil/gas interests before people actually notice. Pruitt's the most flagrant; it's the quiet ones we should worry about.
3463 2018-07-03 17:02:43 Iran should do more to win the confidence of the world community. It should dispel fears of the international community. It should also improve relations Isreal. It should come back in international community and use its oil resources for the benefit of its citizens

3473 2018-07-03 17:01:29 Cleanse first and then a couple drops worked into the skin instead of a typical moisturizer. I’m not an expert on quantity to be honest as the only oil I typically use is a pre-shave oil for a smoother/closer shave.

3486 2018-07-03 17:00:23 Perhaps youre right, maybe he was simply asking. But one thing Asad said is definitely true: increasing production of oil is against Saudi interest. The fact that Salman still did it says a lot, and it shows whos really the boss & who is the slave. (Hint: Salman is not the boss)
3487 2018-07-03 17:00:04 Why are you not protesting the thousands barrels of oil coming into Canada from the Middle East with lax human rights laws, and only fight Canadian oil that is proven to be the safest in the world. Oh right, all that US$$$. #hypocrites

3494 2018-07-03 16:59:30 i’m not sure either. it just seems like pure monounsaturated fat has no healthy benefits with the other nutrients since refined olive oil has no health benefits since it’s depleted of nutrients and anti-inflammation phyto-compounds.

Drinking coconut oil tonight to get rid of all the trash I ate today hehe
3543 2018-07-03 16:54:07 I would recommend incorporating an oil into your routine. Your two moisturizers are both great, but oils create a better occlusive barrier than those two meaning they do a significantly better job at preventing moisture loss and preventing that dry feeling post-HA.

And because it's big pharma, it will be federally  legal. Schools will be allowed to administer it to our kids

Oil will run out and we will be forced into producing energy via Unconventional Gas Extraction, by shoving a rubber pipe up our bum holes and force feeding ourselves sprouts and beans, in order to keep the DVD player on standby.

3582 2018-07-03 16:48:49 Had my first customer interaction at my new job. I stumbled. She wasn't interested in buying anyway if she was there for an oil change, more or less information gathering.
3583 2018-07-03 16:48:33 Has anyone got any suggestions of the best valve oil to use? Thanks
3584 2018-07-03 16:48:30 The man at Goodyear knew exactly who I was and my husband’s name before I barely said hello. We have been here waaay too much lately. No catastrophe today just an oil change.
3585 2018-07-03 16:48:29 Norway has five million people and huge oil reserves, they are an outlier.

3588 2018-07-03 16:48:07 I beg to differ on that note, remember 2-5yrs ago the Zar was R14-16 to the $ and crude oil above $100 but fuel was around R12-13 a liter. Their determination is flawed and not transparent. The dep of Energy is looting SA
3589 2018-07-03 16:48:05 slice them into rounds half a cm thick, toss in salted and peppered flour, dip in beaten egg, fry on high heat in veg oil. No need to peel even. I dare you to say it's not delicious
3590 2018-07-03 16:48:03 Let's just debunk benghazi.. After all these investigations, no wrong doing was found. Seems like some new shit on trump that yall will find any reason to debunk. Even when stated out of trumps own mouth. Not to mention, why ask Saudi to ramp up oil? Why would he agree?
3591 2018-07-03 16:48:02 is there any evidence that pure monounsaturated fat has any health benefits? extra virgin olive oil has nutrients like vitamin E & K1 as well as anti-inflammation phyto-compounds.
3592 2018-07-03 16:47:58 I use just coconut oil, but you can mix with other things; just don't stay in strong sun out too long until you already have tan, build up slowly

3596 2018-07-03 16:47:43 My fave way to cook greens of any kind is in a pan with a little olive oil, lots of garlic and salt. Stir to get them coated and wilted, then drizzle a little balsamic vinegar over them and stir to carmelize it quickly.  SO EFFIN GOOD.
3597 2018-07-03 16:47:43 Feeling happy with MY tea tonight: 'fresh fresh pasta' (spag, cucumber, mint & olive oil) super quick & feels healthy. 4yo  pasta &  cucumber but decided she'd only eat cold tinned rice pudding with strawberries & raspberries for tea... Sigh

3599 2018-07-03 16:47:36 They have filed lawsuits upon lawsuits only to have them dismissed. The military at one time assaulted them during one of the military regime to give way for more drilling by oil companies. Amnesty international exposed them. The military tried to blame the assault on neighbors.
3600 2018-07-03 16:47:34 What if KSA increase oil prod by 2m b/d and US put sanctions on others to limit their production. It will again balance the equation without having any effect on prices of oil

3605 2018-07-03 16:47:03 How was the crude oil price doing?

3614 2018-07-03 16:46:33 Too many Republicans fought for that pipeline and they will lose money.  But if there's a way to keep our farmlands free of oil spills,  then I'll take this reason. So yeah, go for it!

3617 2018-07-03 16:46:18 @JordanTishlerMD 3. Cbd oil is legal in our state but not covered by medical insurance. Also, most schools will dose a kid with a medically prescribed big pharma med, but not a natural supplement.
3618 2018-07-03 16:46:10 PG&E opposes #sb100 because,  well, it's in deep legal trouble. So do WSPA aka Big Oil in California, Manufacturers, and Big Ag.

3621 2018-07-03 16:45:52 The rise of the oil price is the most contributing factor and the exchange rate of the currency is also contributing due to some political reasons which I'm not quite sure about...

Dearest friends,

The air is humid and hot, a wet kind of misery. Still, as though through some miracle, Nashville has yet to burn. 

Despite dwindling rations of beard oil and food truck tacos, our morale remains steady. 

Oh yeah. New single this week.

3628 2018-07-03 16:45:24 Mass corruption and
 "oil" which made up 95% of their export earnings allowed them to fund social programs and reduce poverty.

When the oil prices plummeted, they were forced to cut significantly from those programs

Also government control of currency exchange was disastrous
3629 2018-07-03 16:45:16 Just hype to get people primed for the upcoming King of Oil movie
3630 2018-07-03 16:45:15 My Darling WillowBreeze,
Once again, we have walked into an entire town of already-dying enemy soldiers. They were storing crude oil, arsenic, and corpses in their own water supply. They explained, as they convulsed, that regulations are bad for business.

3631 2018-07-03 16:45:07 That is what she said.
3632 2018-07-03 16:44:47 I remember listening to an interview while he was with the Oil where Rishaug asked him what he needed to do to work his way off the 4th line after being in the doghouse. His answer was "I just need to keep playing my game".

Um...no...your game is what landed you there.

3634 2018-07-03 16:44:30 I cannot answer based on opinion of what my take is on that. Rather, I base my answers on facts. This was directly an oil response of what caused it. An international commodity that's traded and gets affected by global ranking of the country's currency 
3635 2018-07-03 16:44:27 sorry which government are you referring to here? IMO, the oil wealth sharing conflict can only be resolved long-term when there is a comprehensive political solution that results in a democratic government that is accountable to the people. Haftar doesn't want that and seeks

We rescued those sweet minded leftists and they are recuperating.

3658 2018-07-03 16:42:05 I have a dream that the cattle rearing business will surpass crude oil and gas both in expanding industrial capacity, revenue generation, and employment opportunities.
3659 2018-07-03 16:42:01 are u sure the health benefits come from the monounsaturated fats or does it come from phyto compound of the olive? non-extra virgin olive oil does not have the health benefits of extra virgin despite having the same amount of monounsaturated fats.

3696 2018-07-03 16:37:57 Fran was supposed to bring that.  I was in charge of oil and balsamic vinegar.
3697 2018-07-03 16:37:54 What!??    President Buhari do something practical.... start by taking care of the Police .pay them like oil workers .... this killings & things Will change......with speed
3698 2018-07-03 16:37:48 Definitely use a primer that does not have oil or silicone. Same thing with the foundation, make there there isn’t spf (unless you need because that causes oiliness). Also if you try baking, I’ve noticed that helps a ton on my combo skin. I’ve heard fenty is great for oily skin
3699 2018-07-03 16:37:45 Scott Pruitt closed his office to (most of) his own staffers. Good luck trying to get thru to him. The only people with 24/7 access to his ear are oil/coal industry lobbyists. So what are you trying to say here? This lady bothering him for 80 seconds is what does it for you?
3700 2018-07-03 16:37:44 Mike stay up there until I can bring some bolt cutters out and get a concrete landing pad for you under the bridge.  By the way your climbing rope is made from oil.  You’re a complete fucktard.
3701 2018-07-03 16:37:43 yeah i’m gonna get the dropper of oil to try it out!
3702 2018-07-03 16:37:38 i just finished a seven and a half hour shift starting at 5am without a lunch break there is onion in my bra and my shirt is covered in olive oil
3703 2018-07-03 16:37:36 What!??    President Buhari do something practical.... start by taking care of the Police .pay them like oil workers .... A Police man Pays for His shoes & cloths . Sad.  this killings & things Will change......with speed
3704 2018-07-03 16:37:35 Trying to make Iran a pariah state is a shit move by you! Forcing the west to not accept their oil is another shit move by you. Fortunately, the rest of the world will accept their oil. Putting your own spin on a narrative is very transparent. Saudi/US oil, ruling is ending
3705 2018-07-03 16:37:32 You impoverish W-Canadians yet we import oil on the east coast from human rights abusing middle eastern countries? Are you also proposing to shut down the car industry in Ontario or the aeroplane industry in Quebec? Stop using #BCFerries or #DieselBuses in public transit?
3706 2018-07-03 16:37:17 Fox Business News: Russia to boost oil production.

Seems much of the world is working with Trump to put pressure on Iranian regime. Saudi’s announce big boost, Russia joins in, South Korea cuts Iran oil imports... an on and on.
3707 2018-07-03 16:37:16 Omg even I mess up brownies by adding a bit to much oil in it but MINES NEVER LOOK THAT DRYYY!!!
3708 2018-07-03 16:37:13 That mct oil will make you want to stand next to any nearby toilet

OIL

3711 2018-07-03 16:36:51 The point I was trying to make was, has Assad given up Syrias' claim to Golan in exchange for Israel no longer supporting IS etc. and the US trying to overthrow him? Israel gets Golan oil, Syria gets peace, and the US goes home, hopefully along with the FUK part of the equation.
3712 2018-07-03 16:36:50 Ouch.

It certainly looks like the Oil have upgraded their assistant coaching but that one hurts
3713 2018-07-03 16:36:46 No, my country, Norway, is not even in the list. But the answer lean in Norway should be pretty obvious, we went from a not very prosperous, small outskirt country to a very wealthy oil nation in the last half century
3714 2018-07-03 16:36:40 P sure I'm breaking out bc of my rose oil. Awesome.
3715 2018-07-03 16:36:36 Ole skool say you gotta get down there and change that oil 
3716 2018-07-03 16:36:30 Fine, but until you also recognize it would be much easier to make the model work in a country like Norway with the size and type of population and the oil wealth, then there is no sense arguing either.  They have much less % of people who would try to be slugs off the system
3717 2018-07-03 16:36:27 Trump, this disgusting moron is more and more dangerous. He acts hand with hand with Putin. That is why (because of him) the oil prices are rising!
3718 2018-07-03 16:36:27 Let be clear, there is no one size fits all. CBD oil may help some and it also needs to be legal & not schedule 1 like it currently is. Stating Kratom can be addictive is a dog whistle type comment that is so generic. Every substance with psychoactive properties can be addictive.
3719 2018-07-03 16:36:24 True Summer, and we are ready to do more if needed. It’s on an equal basis deal. We,Saudis, are willing to pump as much oil as markets need if that will have Iran stop from doing what they are doing now in our region
3720 2018-07-03 16:36:21 No worries, understand where you’re coming from now… Carry-on 
3721 2018-07-03 16:36:19 Well if @KristenxLeanne says castor oil works then I must try it myself. 
3722 2018-07-03 16:36:17 Yeah, me and a manual clutch get along like oil and water.
3723 2018-07-03 16:36:07 Socialism is not viable anywhere in the world. Norway and Sweden are using their north sea oil wealth to cover the Bill. What happens when that runs out ?  See Venezuela

3727 2018-07-03 16:35:39 @zerodhaonline hi, today a buy order in crude oil was executed automatically, even after i have cancelled all the pending orders. This resulted in a huge loss of Rs. 9,800/-. As this happened due to the bug in your app, I want a full refund of the loss incurred.
3728 2018-07-03 16:35:38 Does that mean the oil pipelines have already been set...

3732 2018-07-03 16:35:23 Indeed not, that was in the tank graveyard in Kuwait circa 1999. Some of them were in such good condition I swear you could have changed the battery and oil then driven it away!

3736 2018-07-03 16:34:41 All of a sudden we are told about oil levies mntakabawo.
3737 2018-07-03 16:34:39 True and we are ready to do more if needed. It’s on an equal basis deal. We,Saudis, are willing to pump as much oil as markets need if that will have Iran stop from doing what they are doing now in our region
3738 2018-07-03 16:34:24 On the 29th of June 2018, the Department of Energy (DoE) announced that fuel prices will increase (effective from 4 July). This increase can be attributed to several factors, namely: the price of crude oil as well as the rand’s value against the US dollar.
3739 2018-07-03 16:34:18 Had it from the keg in the stag and it blew me away. Up there with neck oil. Please distribute further.
3740 2018-07-03 16:34:17 Norway is rich because of oil!!!!!!
3741 2018-07-03 16:34:17 Trump is asking Saudi to pump 2 million more barrel a day to bring the price down. This alone will cost Canada billions of dollars in lost revenue because the US controls Canadian oil. F*cking moron protester. How can JT justify losing this revenue when he needs to show something
3742 2018-07-03 16:34:14 What!??    President Buhari do something practical.... start by taking care of the Police .pay them like oil workers .... this killings & things Will change......with speed

3748 2018-07-03 16:33:53 Serious question
Not looking for a fight
Canada economy and jobs are heavily dependent on oil
Do you want Canada out of the oil business? 
What would you fill in the void with
$ for $ job for job? 
We now out supply Middle East to the USA market
We are politically stable ME no
3749 2018-07-03 16:33:49 Olive oil and salt all over a salad with cooked chorizo is amazing !!

3751 2018-07-03 16:33:42 Had this down as a turn week for oil. Last 2 weeks and monthly close were maybe hinting at further gains to $80+. Will see how we close this week.
3752 2018-07-03 16:33:35 The POTUS neither controls nor sets the price of oil and gas.  OPEC and market traders do. Prices will always fluctuate. The best that any one can do to lower gas and oil prices in the U.S. is to get 100% behind President Trump's efforts to make America energy independent.
3753 2018-07-03 16:33:34 True and we are ready to do more if needed. It’s on an equal basis deal. We,Saudis, are willing to pump as much oil as markets need if that will have Iran stop from doing what they are doing now in our region
3754 2018-07-03 16:33:33 I was going to take my car & wife's car to Walmart for oil changes this weekend. But we will go somewhere else.
3755 2018-07-03 16:33:32 For silky hair, mix 3 parts olive oil and 1 part honey. Put in microwave 30 sec. Apply to damp hair 20 mins with shower cap on. Rinse well!
3756 2018-07-03 16:33:28 Nope. US funded enviro kooks are taking US cash to prevent landlocked Cdn product from finally reaching the world market and competing with US oil and not being sold at a 50% discount to US refineries for huge US profits.

3761 2018-07-03 16:33:00 #OOTT #Oil #WTI
Pundits have been pumping up oil prices day in and day out and predicted $100 a barrel oil relentlessly for undisclosed agenda. Many traders have been brainwashed. This is why a strong rebound could have taken place after a plunge in free fall this morning.

3767 2018-07-03 16:32:14 I like the asiam curl defining cream with water, oil and the green eco style. I use ties to keep the knots in place and be sure to put oil on the ends so they don’t dry out

3774 2018-07-03 16:31:52 Second, much of Venezuela's social failures are due to it relying heavily on one industry (oil) and a powerful wealthy to upper middle class (with help from US and European corporations) that favors austerity. Those are the ones mostly protesting (whining) in that country.

3784 2018-07-03 16:31:03 My skin has a mind of its own
I use Biore face wash 2x a day (I prefer the acne one cause I get stress breakouts). 
Queen Helene or Era Organics manuka honey walnut face scrub before bed. 
Charcoal mask before the face scrub every few days. 
A natural oil instead of moisturizer
3785 2018-07-03 16:30:49 While olive oil is higher in omega6 than omega3, the total amount of polyunsaturated fatty acid is very low, so it is unlikely to contribute to an imbalance in omega6/3 ratio. And studies have almost always shown monounsaturated fatty acids to be beneficial.

3800 2018-07-03 16:29:07 when I've done it, I've used eco styler gel (any kind but I like the olive oil one) and cantu curling gel for moisture. Any styler or moisturizer should work perfectly fine.
3801 2018-07-03 16:29:06 I dont know enough to say it was or wasnt Eakins. But he wasnt the only coach to fail in the last 10-12 years. Maybe he's not an NHL coach, but he has a decent record outside of the Oil. IMO: everything starts at the top when we're blaming team disappointment/player development.
3802 2018-07-03 16:29:04 @realDonaldTrump Iran's regime will no longer be able to export a barrel of oil on November 4; the Iranian regime has no choice but to fall, because it has no legitimacy. Every president in the US allowed the terrorist regime to remain in power
3803 2018-07-03 16:29:03 so happy I found this place that does cheap oil changes 
3804 2018-07-03 16:29:00 And about the oil thing; I would rather we use pipelines in our country because it upholds the infrastructure and as much as going green would be awesome it’s not there yet. The power output of solar and electric and wind is limited and hydro can only go in so many places.
3805 2018-07-03 16:28:54 Doesn't justify the crimes going on recently, there's definitely a lacuna in the security apparatus which needs affixal asap
3806 2018-07-03 16:28:51 Now you just need a giant oil painting portrait done of yourself to hang above the mantle
3807 2018-07-03 16:28:50 Assuming that every bit of care for everybody should be paid for through insurance is part of what got us here (though for the poor a safety net makes sense). Your car insurance is for catastrophic incidents. If it also paid for oil changes and flat tires, it would cost a fortune
3808 2018-07-03 16:28:47 At what point does Scott Pruitt’s petty corruption become too much and he gets replaced with a run of the mill oil lobbyist?
3809 2018-07-03 16:28:45 Oil Prices rallied amid concerns about a global supply shortage and sanctions against Iran. Meanwhile, US oil inventories are fell sharply amid increased refinery activity and a modest drop in the oil rig count.
3810 2018-07-03 16:28:36 South Korea has imported four times more CPC Blend crude so far in 2018 than in the same period last year, as the major Asian oil consumer seeks to replace Iranian supplies, shipments data and trading sources said.#OOTT

3817 2018-07-03 16:27:36 I love robotic oil poffins~!
3818 2018-07-03 16:27:36 Why did I think it was a good idea to put coconut oil in my hair before going work now everyone’s gonna think my hairs well greasy
3819 2018-07-03 16:27:28 Agreed. This is why it’s so important to study the response to the 1970s oil price crisis — perhaps the largest concentrated infusion of liquid capital into the global economy in world history, at a time when people were writing new rules about its uses and conditions.
3820 2018-07-03 16:27:24 But pull them up on the job bank and take a look. Also the oil & gas industry will fly employees from all over the country.
3821 2018-07-03 16:27:23 Obama was a snake oil salesman with a golden (forked) tongue. America was duped by the democrats. No more
3822 2018-07-03 16:27:05 You don’t eat it. Ha. Just providing a less white version of zinc for thise like you who may hate “the white”. I think the chemicals in most sunscreens are A LOT worse for a person than sunflower oil on the skin IMHO.
3823 2018-07-03 16:27:00 I dunno... I’d like Doyle and Warshaw to continue their oil and water cage match vibe for the rest of the season.
3824 2018-07-03 16:26:59 I should have just stayed up all night to come get my oil changed at 6am instead of waiting 2 fucken hours now

Dm me if interested
3827 2018-07-03 16:26:46 Stop using coconut oil!! It’s not doing your skin any good. The best oils to use are jojoba or squalene oil as they are the closest match to the natural sebum your skin produces. Honestly the biggest thing that helped my oily skin is witch hazel toner + good moisturizer!!!!

3829 2018-07-03 16:26:41 Or at least, not any more. The oil tanker Serene Sea is currently docked at the terminal and was scheduled to leave port this morning.
3830 2018-07-03 16:26:41 7/2/18. Iran Pres Rouhani says that Iran will continue nuclear agreement as long as its interests are preserved, following a day in which the US says it aims to reduce Iran’s oil exports to zero to pressure it into a better deal.
3831 2018-07-03 16:26:36 Israel gave its exploitation to a US oil company.

3836 2018-07-03 16:26:10 The person I was talking about is self-taught. You can do it! Never too late.

My parents were really supportive of me and my love for artsy stuff (na wala na ngayon). They enrolled me to an oil painting class and I think my dad enjoyed it as much as I did. 
3837 2018-07-03 16:26:09 Going to be LIVE shortly on @FoxBusiness with @TeamCavuto talking oil supply disruptions and global prices.

3850 2018-07-03 16:25:00 I am not an expert on the oil market but I imagine it would suffer as the rest of the economy does -- not considering other factors (which should also be considered), there are lots of balls in the air with that one.

Then use your foundation and set it with a setting powder (I love Laura Mercier) and ALSO a setting spray like Urban Decay All Nighter. All steps are necessary for me.

3861 2018-07-03 16:23:56 This Is How Much U.S. Households Lose As Gas/Oil Prices Rise:  The relationship is bogus,  I recall when Oil was $75/gal and gas was 62 cents.  Price are high because of Congress' irresponsibility.
3862 2018-07-03 16:23:52 Until we have a Democratic Congress, Senate and President, say goodbye to Bears Ears.  In the meantime, oil and mining companies will have a hayday destroying it.

3867 2018-07-03 16:22:55 I cook a lot. Yesterday was the first time the oil in the skillet ignited and created a giant ball of fire over my asparagus.

Proud to day I did the right thing: I screamed WHOAH WHOAH WHOAH at the fireball, as if it was a horse, until it disappeared. #food #cooking

3901 2018-07-03 16:20:42 They're an oil rich nation. I'm not saying they'd be wealthier or poorer. But the income gap would grow and their standard of living would go down.
3902 2018-07-03 16:20:40 CRUDE OIL PRICE

It will NOT fall until Mega Banks do margin calls on Glencore, Gunvor or Vitol.

Glencore quite likely is going down.

SOON COME.
3903 2018-07-03 16:20:35 Because we dont have enough money to send our troops abroad, they should go to the coast. There is lots to shoot at there. If we sold oil we could afford an army with newer weapons. With the pipeline being of national interest they should get 5 years for blocking it.
3904 2018-07-03 16:20:25 Dan,
1- You are looking exactly at the other half of the glass. 
Look at oil prices for last 150 years.  What do you see?

Now, OPEC problem is that it failed to replace the 7 Sisters and the TRRC.  Failure to manage, led to price volatility
3905 2018-07-03 16:20:06 Due to a tank overflow 460 barrels of brine and 3,360  gallons of  oil were released & contained within diking on-site at a central tank battery near Glenburn, Sat. A state  inspector was scheduled to be on location this week and all product has  been reported as recovered.

3930 2018-07-03 16:17:48 Oil prices are not dictated by elect energy production. Oil based fuels are mainly auto with some parts of the country using for heating oil. Fossil fuels are minimal in elect. Transportation is a whole new ball game.
3931 2018-07-03 16:17:45 Yup but how else will our stagnate economy littered with hippies opposing our sale of commodities thrive? Canada should of nationalized oil instead of taxing everyone out of the wazzoz and having lax laundering laws

3962 2018-07-03 16:14:24 That’s only normal of you choose to do a higher end oil. That also depends on your mileage.
3963 2018-07-03 16:14:20 „Disruptions in Iran“  it’s the USA demand that all countries stop importing Iranian oil by November - taking artificially substantial amount of oil output off the world market. Be at least honest.

They continue to sell decades of failures as success, modern snake oil con men & women. 
Bottom line: they have & will sellout America& Americans for their personalgain.

Just pointing out absurd rules & Twittipater Doublethink. 5000 rule is arbitrary & capricious. What's the justification? Why 5000? Why not 2000 or 10,000. W/ Twitter's lack of transparency & obtuseness- who knows?

3980 2018-07-03 16:12:37 Gotta say, I disagree with you on this one.The way to protest the use of oil is to commit to alternatives and use less oil.Not put other people at risk. The fact is that this world is based on petrol and it is all going to burn one way or the other. WW use 99mil brls/day &rising

3987 2018-07-03 16:11:43 This is a hard one to choose from. I would choose my Josie Maran Argan SPF 47. If I took all my necessities it would be face moisturizer and cleanser, Josie Maran argan body butter, organic coconut oil, brow pencil and lip balm.
3988 2018-07-03 16:11:42 Glad you’re reporting on a sour practice that has long been understood in the GeoScience community&which benefits some& is devastating to many.Especially w/laws in place in some states that outlaw public protest.Laws put in place by legislators that serve big oil,not constituents
3989 2018-07-03 16:11:41 You know the drill, it’s time for another #TriviaTuesday! What year was oil struck at Spindletop?
3990 2018-07-03 16:11:36 Mr.G, how did you make out with the oil trade of 6/28. I see on my chart it made target then dropped through you buy, touched you resistance and is now up above your buy.
3991 2018-07-03 16:11:26 And so what? Because one mad man believes so. Is that enough to victimize the rest of the tribe?

4001 2018-07-03 16:10:45 How about discontinuing the shipment of thermal coal out of Vancouver all together. Accounts for almost the same amount of GHGs as the Albert Oil Sands.

4003 2018-07-03 16:10:40 You were right in that the goalkeeper was the difference. This was right up there close to 2006 as far as emotions go. If you told me before those playoffs the Oil would make the Cup Finals I would've laughed and taken it. But Game 7 sucked. Same emotions this morning w Jpn.
4004 2018-07-03 16:10:35 No kidding.  Oil's intrinsic, extreme short-run supply & demand inelasticities along w/ limited/costly storage make prices prone to boom/bust cycles.  Industry  handle surpluses or deficits well.  History shows only cartelization or govt supply control stabilizes prices.  1/2

4027 2018-07-03 16:08:58 Jeff, I don't think your implied argument that Canada and US statistics are the same, I have heard US isn't much better than Nigeria now that Trump has pulled so many regulations and splills will only get worse.  Canadian oil cos take their regulations serious and do their best..

4033 2018-07-03 16:08:08 Mayonnaise as we do it in France is basically oil, egg yolk, vinegar and mustard seeds. Egg+vinegar+mustard add a nice flavor, but I would recommend butter for as a tastier oil.

4109 2018-07-03 16:01:17 I agree with you. This price is going to rocket if the US can choke out Iranian oil. The drilling companies that survived that crash have stabilized, and my hunch is they don't expect these prices to last.

4238 2018-07-03 15:50:24 It’s 91 degrees outside and I just got a delivery of heating oil. Do they think I’m the one causing this heat or something?
4239 2018-07-03 15:50:19 Wounding our relation with allies (and NATO) while bowing to brutal dictators. Insulting institutions of law and order with bald-faced lies. Taking credit for Obama's recovery while intentionally harming the economy with trade wars and oil shocks...all for his ego: GREAT JOB!

4304 2018-07-03 15:44:50 I often hear #leftists equate accelerated depreciation and special write downs for Oil/Gas (which are typically balance sheet items) with the straight cash subsidies from gov't to #Renewables... leftists tend to be both innumerate and ignorant about things they hate.
4305 2018-07-03 15:44:45 If buttermilk is the last product from milk. Plastic is the last product from crude oil. As long as we use petrol/diesel. Plastic will be available.

4331 2018-07-03 15:42:38 Excellent @driftingtides!  Looks like they use the F2py approach and have got a good start.  I didn't realize that they had!  Super helpful!  They have a 'mining focus', representative sampling, variograms and kriging.  We could bring the oil & gas focus.  I'll look into it.
4332 2018-07-03 15:42:37 Crude oil is not the problem we are actually in a glut when it comes to Crude. Lack of Refineries in the U.S.A. is why fuels are so expensive!

4334 2018-07-03 15:42:33 Nigeria crude oil will be useless in a couple of years. 

Tesla is now producing 5,000 electric cars a week.

With a phonecall, the US can decide to increase or decrease OPEC oil production. 

Our govt is not making strategic decisions to become a global power in the future.
4335 2018-07-03 15:42:32 hope this oil change don’t take too long .

4340 2018-07-03 15:42:18 The problem is US refiners cannot use the light oil that US is producing. This is pretty much confirmed by all the MLP companies.
4341 2018-07-03 15:42:14 LoL - industrials is industrials (ie everything mining, manuf, utilities ect.)
Industrial cyclicals are basically manufacturers ex food & refiners. BTW oil refining output growth is flat. (in case u're wondering that i'm intentionally suppressing production)

4348 2018-07-03 15:41:31 and why isn't Green Peace protesting else where where oil pipelines are going in, like in Texas
4349 2018-07-03 15:41:13 #oott  Understand, however compliance was over 150% and the agreement calls to fall back to 100% which implies more oil to markets.  However, Iran's concession was that no member could take other country's additional quota.

4374 2018-07-03 15:38:39 このような仕様ですので流石に初期の粘度低下はある程度妥協すべきかとは思います。ただそれ以降の粘度低下は低めかと?

内容的にはかなりお買い得だと個人的には思います。トヨタが気合い入れた新処方かつGTLベースですので。といってもそれが体感的に合うかどうかは別なので難しい所ではありますね。

4410 2018-07-03 15:35:13 Please stop being clueless. Trump's STUPID tariffs have caused the price of gas to shoot up. Moreover, you CAN'T advocate for both cheaper gas AND oil and gas jobs. When gas is cheap it's too expensive for US to produce it. So decide if you want higher prices or more employment.

4422 2018-07-03 15:34:32 Oil at 80+ $ barrel gives short term gain for Russia Saudi and Kuwait, but vastly strengthens much cheaper wind, solar and tidal power esp if all the predictions are the price will stay high. But hey, I thought OPEC was supposed to have lost its power to ram up prices... ?
4423 2018-07-03 15:34:24 I think that is essentially the deal between the Trump administration and the Saudi royal court -- the United States eliminates Iranian crude exports and pushes for regime change in Iran while Saudi Arabia guarantees no increase in oil prices
4424 2018-07-03 15:34:19 Currently with the Moron Trump this will be a slow pace. I would still entice U.S. Industry, even with low or no tax incentives. better return with 100K additional workforce. Canada has been to dependent on U.S. markets. Oil pipeline to BC is a big start.

4426 2018-07-03 15:34:16 What an ignorant, uninformed, bigoted view. We'll take the oil with us when we go, then we'll see who's subsidising who.
4427 2018-07-03 15:34:13 True and we are ready to do more if needed. It’s on an equal basis deal. We,Saudis, are willing to pump as much oil as markets need if that will have Iran stop from doing what they are doing now in our region

4492 2018-07-03 15:28:17 @terencecorcoran And here's another Liberal saying it's all Harper's fault. And no it's not over, when our politicians wake up to the fact that oil will be around for a long time to come we will have pipelines east and west.

4499 2018-07-03 15:27:36 "A woman can do any job a man can do, and probably do it better!"
How abt building site labour? Oil rigging? Refuse collection? Logging? Motor racing? Plumbing? Need I go on? Why don't women do those?
"Because we don't want to. Women's skills are far better used elsewhere!"

4501 2018-07-03 15:27:30 No it doesn't because you (A) don't have any prove and (B) ignores the Chinese judicial moves as well as how Russia has contracts with PDVSA (as well as tried to control CITGO) while the US (who cannot control oil prices) hasn't tried to take our oil.
4502 2018-07-03 15:27:22 i need to do my coconut oil routine again cause my lashes are struggling
4503 2018-07-03 15:27:06 Then I use an intense cream/oil. I'm in Colorado so it's dry as heck here. I like Benton's snail/bee cream a lot. It's cheap, luxurious, and does the job.
4504 2018-07-03 15:27:05 Hate taking the Jeep to get the oil changed cause then they tell you everything that’s wrong w/ it & I’m like nope, don’t wanna hear it rn
4505 2018-07-03 15:26:49 Try cbd oil. I take it for my piriformis tear. Healthcare says i'm too young for surgery.
4506 2018-07-03 15:26:45 Still dont forgive you for the Dermodex pic. U should tell ur fans that tea tree oil will help
4507 2018-07-03 15:26:42 Had to go to the Toyota dealership to get my oil changed my appointment was at 9 am. I got here at 8:30 and they took my car on back and said it would take 45 min. I'm still sitting here because they just now put my car on the lift. And i was going to stream soon but fml right?
4508 2018-07-03 15:26:40 Almost died and fell face-forward in front of an unopened glass of chili oil lolololol
4509 2018-07-03 15:26:24 It’s an equal basis deal. We Saudis are willing to pump as much oil as markets need if that will Iran from doing what doing now in our region.
4510 2018-07-03 15:26:19 i need an oil change but do i feel like sitting there all day?

4517 2018-07-03 15:25:38 Made it five minutes through the first episode. If it is just a cooking show that adds "cannabis oil" to their food, it's just a cooking show. Let's talk about decarbing and different ways of preparing. Sous Vide anyone?
4518 2018-07-03 15:25:29 Fake news is part of #oil weapon i still recall #CNN had a news on #trump exit day from #irandeal that 'trump is keeping the deal sources say'
4519 2018-07-03 15:25:27 That's how I feel, it's not like with the oil being sold we were living in luxury, let's all go down together and maybe that would make a difference, however I doubt it as the fat cats in Tripoli have made scary fortunes of money off corruption
4520 2018-07-03 15:25:27 ANYWAY . TEA TREE OIL FACE STEAM . LETS GO .

4526 2018-07-03 15:25:08 We hate to be the bearers of bad news, but Spicy Thai has been discontinued! We'd recommend giving our Almond Oil Fiery Thai a shot instead, it's very similar to the Spicy Thai you know and love

4530 2018-07-03 15:24:46 I know my potato salad didn’t go over so well so I will be bringing vegan coleslaw with kale, toasted pepitas, sunflower seeds and sesame oil to #civilwarpotluck.
4531 2018-07-03 15:24:30 My favorite marinade for grilled meats...this is especially good on pork:
1 c. oil
3/4 c. soy sauce
1/2 c. lemon juice
1/4 c. Worcestershire
1 T. mustard
1 t. pepper
2 cloves garlic
1/4 c. brown sugar.
Mix & pour into ziploc bag w/chops. Marinate 3-4 hrs.
 Happy Independence Day!

4533 2018-07-03 15:24:28 Started my day with leftovers from dinner last night - I tried a new  tempeh recipe - this time baking tempeh in the oven with a marinade of  some various spices & garlic
 And meanwhile on the stove  cooking onions, garlic, olive oil, some vegetables and some water

4546 2018-07-03 15:23:28 So why Wisc kansas nd sd montana - is it oil gas? Makes no sense?
4547 2018-07-03 15:23:27 yeah, cheap and dirty players of 'makeeko'.
4548 2018-07-03 15:23:15 Not even close, TX has a total production of ~1.1 billion barrels annually, U.S consumption is 7.2 billion barrels annually.

That's why TX/OK/MS/LA are still paying 2.50/gal - there's not enough domestic supply for the demand.

Why not put a 250,000% tariff on imported oil?
4549 2018-07-03 15:23:13 So. First of all remove make-up with whatever make-up remover. Then dual cleanse (oil plus foam/gel cleanser).

4553 2018-07-03 15:22:25 Went to get the oil changed in my wife’s car. 
Me: It’s a VW. Do you carry the special magical blend of European oil it takes. 

Tech: Yes we do. (Immediately starts working on draining oil)

Morgan Freeman: No they didn’t.
4554 2018-07-03 15:22:19 Maybe demand your federal govt @JustinTrudeau @NavdeepSBains and @cathmckenna create a national EV incentive plan? They got $10B for an oil pipeline, they should have some loose spare change in the couch for EVs
4555 2018-07-03 15:22:15 In Norway you are only allowed to masturbate if you use Fish Oil as lube, it's in the Law.
4556 2018-07-03 15:22:10 If they hit oil it will be a biblical few weeks, shallow first target will be hit within the first 15 days, spud next week it only goes one way as momentum and sentiment kick it, potential sells and the potential of #matd is unrivalled
4557 2018-07-03 15:22:07 Crude Nation was good. Its slightly out of date now but it definitely explains why they made the monumently stupid choice to base the entire economy on oil.

4559 2018-07-03 15:21:42 Right, that’s how it works. A couple of guys agree (via tweets no less) on the price of oil...

4566 2018-07-03 15:21:07 Girl I suggest washing your hair at least once or twice a week with organics shampoo and then condition it with the organics conditioner. Base your scalp every 2days with coconut oil and castor oil (mixed together) or you can mix them with the black chic avocado hair food...

4575 2018-07-03 15:20:35 Power steering fluid should be serviced every 30,000 miles. Unlike your engine or transmission, power steering systems do not come equipped with a filter. Power steering fluid is both a lubricating oil and a hydraulic fluid.

4577 2018-07-03 15:20:28 with all of these approaches, I'm assuming that you will use oil for fat to cook in. Butter will work as for cooking and baking but not for making stock and have a completely different texture. You can also cook with nothing, but getting fats is important in the diet, too. It

4583 2018-07-03 15:20:09 Salmon steaks.
Pan sear them in butter with a dash of olive oil, salt & pepper.
Remove steaks from pan and plate up.

Shallot Cream Sauce:
Over a low heat fry 1 cup chopped shallots; large pinch of salt.
Stir in 2 cups cream.
Heat to reduce.
Pour over the steaks.
4584 2018-07-03 15:20:06 Gas prices were drive down after the collapse.  Even in doing so- oil companies continued to make record profits.   This chart shows rapid escalation of price-  it is. It a call for rapid reduction.

4602 2018-07-03 15:18:55 72.98 seems to be going to the rearview mirror but let see where the 15 minute candle ends. Wow, between watching oil and the world cup, who has time to sleep? :)
4603 2018-07-03 15:18:48 This is your reminder to take the time to care for your edges. 

Take a week where you don’t sleek. Condition and oil. Let your edges rock. We don’t do receding or struggling hairlines. 

That’s all, carry on.
4604 2018-07-03 15:18:40 So, what does Trump tweet when the price of oil still goes up?

4607 2018-07-03 15:18:02 Is it taking the oil path?
4608 2018-07-03 15:17:57 Exactly. Bernie and his flock weren’t honest enough to admit that everyone in more socialist developed countries pays higher taxes. Running on Scandinavian socialism while pretending that we can just tax the rich to get there is snake oil populist hucksterism.

4613 2018-07-03 15:17:51 Republicans look after their oil buddies-  always have.  Dick Cheney declared that the US could easily sustain gas prices of $4 or $5 per gallon (that was over 20 years ago).  We will see $4 this summer- count on it.

There IS no such thing as "clean coal" and "clean oil". Both DO fuck up our environment more than anything else (aside from plastic Pollution - which is, in essence, oil too).

Oil is something unique.

4642 2018-07-03 15:15:42 I’m confused aren’t you responsible for the environment. How about paying attention to the destruction of our lands in Norhern Canada due to the Oil sands production.

4646 2018-07-03 15:15:21 Since I've got you here, do you know if it's possible to use attributes of a data frame to store information? I am trying to build project-level data across oil sands projects, and I want to keep basic attributes (project type, start and end dates, etc) along with time series.
4647 2018-07-03 15:15:17 You said "[those] countries are trying to control [Venezuelan] oil", my tweet demonstrates that is false. The USA manipulated oil prices to affect Russia (it did) that same tactic also affected other countries. USA claims Venezuelan oil is "too dirty" but not shale oil?!
4648 2018-07-03 15:15:07 Wasn't oil detected in the tail of Halleys Comet last time it swung by? Im sure I remember reading a paper about it years ago where it suggested the possibility of a mechanism for abiogenic production?

4672 2018-07-03 15:13:06 Tell me about it. 4 years ago I was doing research on offshore and land based drilling when oil was at an ath. That crash was brutal as i kept reading rig after rig close down and future build orders cancel. Which also contributed to the turnoil in Venezuela and Brazil...

4688 2018-07-03 15:12:08 You better hope they do.  Canada is going to put steep tariffs on their oil which makes up 30% of US imports.  And if the US doesn't like that, they will begin selling it all to China instead.  Trade wars are easy!

4720 2018-07-03 15:09:06 Yes, it mainly has roots in US oil/pharma astroturfing I think?
4721 2018-07-03 15:08:53 Even if this is true, which I doubt, it's a drop in the ocean compared to the billions of investment headed the other way. You've heard about £60m coming to UK? Well, I've heard of £bns of oil industry money headed for Norway.

4724 2018-07-03 15:08:44 US of A conmen are aware of the critical link between resources (specifically oil) and world dominance. They will make every effort to get hold of it. We can expect nothing but chaos and wars in this century with the vicious American Behemoth on the loose. The bells are tolling..
4725 2018-07-03 15:08:32 Nigeria "peaked" in the 1970s. Since then, Nigeria has gotten progressively worse. There have been short periods of optimism (mini oil booms), but the trajectory is clear.

Now, a major impediment to progress is nostalgia for the 1970s.

4761 2018-07-03 15:05:51 Popularity is not a problem for the plutocrats that drive the GOP agenda. They know a well aimed donation trumps millions of voters. Look at Pruitt. He's willing to sacrifice our children's environment in exchange for a few bucks. Oil industry says, "Money well spent."
4762 2018-07-03 15:05:50 Scott Pruitt needs to go to jail. Secret meeting with oil company, industry lobbyists, you name it, coal company, shipping companies. Sanitizing records and meeting with a Cardinal sexual predator. #Resist

$WTI rises above $75 for the first time since November 2014.

Fear not. We are strong and have been fed well by the #RedHen.Tomorrow we battle the covfefe in SC. They are weak- their supplies of torches & oil are diminished after the battle of Charlottesville. We will succeed & rid the US of #MAGAts.

4777 2018-07-03 15:04:32 Yeah, curious motives here. My hunch in Colombia - though idk - is that enviro issues are very entrenched in their politics bc of deforestation, oil extraction, & species loss. And taking on the platforms offers an alt to mainstream politics. Somalia is more surprising to me.
4778 2018-07-03 15:04:31 Why does this jollof look like it was cooked with Palm Oil?

4790 2018-07-03 15:03:15 The girl was Julia Holbanel but she’s made her profile private! She literally posted a thing about using olive oil to tan, I can’t get cope with how awful that is

4796 2018-07-03 15:02:32 Exactly. If it were about the environment they'd be lobbying for meaningful change, like reducing our reliance on oil etc. not wasting time harassing disabled people about plastic straws.
4797 2018-07-03 15:02:31 Amazing, gas & oil have gone up during summer. I’ve noticed in Florida price usually drops before Christmas to increase retail spending ! Then goes back up. Supply , demand , and a little consumer manipulation !
4798 2018-07-03 15:02:31 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.

4858 2018-07-03 14:56:53 I would say most certainly. China now has major port presence in Djibouti, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. This may have something to do with oil flow as well. Very layered.

4888 2018-07-03 14:54:34 The import based economy is a consequence of the petro$ hegemony. It forces countries to sell goods to USA so they can have $ to buy oil.  Ironically the biggest threat to petro$ and $ hegemony is Trump himself.

4895 2018-07-03 14:54:09 Associated with increased oil production is a change in the manner in which the skin cells mature, predisposing them to plug the follicular pore.
4896 2018-07-03 14:54:01 it's... it's just a Focus? Like mate just change the oil, make sure breaks are OK, make sure nothing is leaking and I'll take your word for it lmao
4897 2018-07-03 14:53:57 True. Samosa when made properly is slow food :) preparing the dough, cooking and preparing the potato filling, slow deep frying. It's when vendors reuse same oil for weeks is when it turns toxic
4898 2018-07-03 14:53:43 Though #Libyans complain, justifiably, of their suffering from predatory politics, many cannot seperate their own benefit from it. 

When oil is closed, the source of Libyan livelihoods AND misery, MANY Libyans blame the effect (closure) rather than the cause (predators politics)
4899 2018-07-03 14:53:42 What then is #Acne?
Acne occurs when sebaceous (oil) glands attached to the hair follicles are stimulated at the time of puberty or due to other hormonal changes. Sebum (oil) is a natural substance that lubricates and protects the skin.

4906 2018-07-03 14:52:44 Remember when oil surged to $120 years ago and there were CONgressional hearings on the evil speculators?
4907 2018-07-03 14:52:39 Exactly, it doesn't make sense why Assad will destroy his country and rule what? Destroyed country? Does he have money to rebuild? Answer is: he is a part of greedy psychos who want to steal oil. He was placed in Syria carefully after years of planning.

4910 2018-07-03 14:52:28 Terrible news for the guerillas! As if they don't have enough problems to deal with! Part of Chinas "Belt and Road" strategy no doubt!

4917 2018-07-03 14:51:53 Russia's not a communist state anymore. They are an oligarchy, and their government is propped up solely by oil. But yes, they did interfere. What did Trump know and when did he know it?

4926 2018-07-03 14:50:47 A fish oil pill is in your mouth. You take a swig of coffee to wash it down but the coffee is too hot and now you face an important choice. Moments like these are the true measure of a man. This is when you find out what you’re made of.

4951 2018-07-03 14:48:40 U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday, boosted by energy stocks as oil prices rose, but gains were capped by a drop in technology stocks, with Facebook sliding on renewed concerns over its data scandal.

4953 2018-07-03 14:48:38 Same , stay away from any product with coconut oil
4954 2018-07-03 14:48:38 #CrudeOil just more profit taking on every spike. Also likely not a rumor about tapping the SPR. Going to likely see some huge draws if they don't dip into the piggy bank. Too much oil coming offline that isn't being replaced and likely can't be replaced fast enough. #OOTT

4959 2018-07-03 14:48:16 Because the new age oil money clubs don't have the global reach and fanbases we have. This is why Liverpool, United and Arsenal are still the big three regardless of recent success.
4960 2018-07-03 14:48:15 We had to spend that money on wars for oil. 

The rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Not just less money, but less care for their children they can't afford insurance for, etc. 

CHIP is a necessity of life for many people.

War for oil and pipelines is not.

This can be heated in seperately with seasoning, veg, etc and then put on rice/porridge when hot to serve. It
5034 2018-07-03 14:41:38 What I didn’t know but seems to be implied here is that jet fuel is priced and therefore needs to be hedged separately from pure oil or gas/petrol used for cars and other smaller engines?

5053 2018-07-03 14:40:19 I understand coal to fuel conversion currently done by Sasol is cheaper than importing crude oil. With so much coal in our country why don't we focus on that? That might even help with job losses as the renewable energy is being introduced.

5061 2018-07-03 14:39:25 So you've made the mistake of thinking that the line was originally moved because of oil, when in fact it was for fishing; and then you've blamed the loss of oil wells on WM, when it was SG that used the fishing boundary for oil. Not doing well on this one, are you?

5075 2018-07-03 14:38:00 Interestingly, the revised Scottish Seas boundary was defined for fishing; it was SG that initially co-opted the boundary for geographic allocation of oil; an approach that HMRC later agreed. So blame the SG for "losing" those oil wells.

Red hat pickets called a short truce yesterday. They traded us energy drinks for our pour over coffee. So far I do not feel any “alpha power,” and suspect it is about as effective as snake oil from the medicine show.

5103 2018-07-03 14:35:52 How should the petrol price be reduced? Bare in mind that the recent increase in the fuel levy is lower than previous increases and fuel prices are mainly determined by the international price of brent crude oil and movements in the rand exchange rate. 

So what should give?

5129 2018-07-03 14:32:54 Great to be on the path of oil import independence. More electrification of transports in near future = cleaner air and lower prices of oil.  2025 looks bright and prosperous for the next president.

5142 2018-07-03 14:32:11 The "held by production" provision enables energy companies to avoid renegotiating leases. This results in considerable savings to them, particularly in geographical areas that have become "hot" due to prolific output from oil and gas wells. Like the sound of that Matt #NTOG

5171 2018-07-03 14:28:43 This was a fact. A lot of the trucks used to transport the oil were Turkish trucks and Turkish drivers. US turned a blind eye to this. Putin did not however and he launched an air strike that took out hundreds of trucks in one strike. That was the beginning of the end.
5172 2018-07-03 14:28:42 At present, Venezuela is suffering from hyperinflation. With an annual inflation rate of 16,428%. Venezuela has the largest crude oil reserve in the world.

Nigeria, are we taking notes?
5173 2018-07-03 14:28:41 "Big oil" should stop distributing all petrochemical products to Rhode Island.
5174 2018-07-03 14:28:24 Saying “we” as in Cdns vs who actually imports oil (oil companies) is a huge difference. Cdns don’t control the flow of our resources, oil companies do. Products are made in many other locations w/horrendous human rights records (China, US). Purchases are NOT unique to estrn Cda
5175 2018-07-03 14:28:20 But it is ok you take a call from a comedian on Air Force One. Jared and Ivanka use Trump Organization servers and you use unsecured phones. Scott Pruitt scrubs his schedules to hide meetings with oil CEO’s. And you complain about National Security? Clean up your own act!
5176 2018-07-03 14:28:19 But by that standard the Trans Mountain review was already a downstream review bc it compared full life cycle of oil sands to other crudes. Wasn't something else intended for Energy East?

5181 2018-07-03 14:27:52 What oil company is doing so much damage?
5182 2018-07-03 14:27:50 Folks want to be something or be a part of something so badly they turn into snake oil salesmen.
5183 2018-07-03 14:27:50 Amen to that! Midland is hurting. The oil companies are putting more weight on the roads. We need better soil stabilization prior to pavement to prevent it. All about that “base”.
5184 2018-07-03 14:27:47 In this instance, however, the objectives of removing Iran’s #oil from the global market while keeping gasoline affordable in battleground states are irreconcilable

5186 2018-07-03 14:27:44 Because, really, nothing says “energy dominance” quite like pretending on social media that an ally will boost their oil production in order to head off the domestic costs of one’s own foreign policy.
5187 2018-07-03 14:27:40 More disinformation! Petrol is cheaper now that in 2012. The US embargo on Iranian oil is limiting supply & pushing up prices. 2012 $111.63 a barrel of Crude. 2018 $70 a barrel. 8 years of no rise in duty. Oil will continue to go up and down. Saudi is about to increase production

5193 2018-07-03 14:27:04 I see my tweet was perhaps a bit vague. All I was getting at was that WTI seems like an outlier when viewed in the context of other oil grades and products.
5194 2018-07-03 14:26:46 Unrelated : always have oil of oregano on hand.
5195 2018-07-03 14:26:41 First, that's not exactly robust evidence. Perhaps he is mis-attributing the general economic recovery with the TJCA. (Also the Fed has said capex is not up outside oil industry which is price, not tax, related.)

5224 2018-07-03 14:24:18 It’s not the Fed that’s responsible for flattening the yield curve it’s the Trump Admin. Procyclical fiscal policy at end of business cycle, trade wars, and geopolitically marginalizing oil production are all contributing strongly to inflation and minimally to economic growth.

5240 2018-07-03 14:23:04 I agree with your sentiments but the unfortunate truth is that you are factually incorrect. The petrol/diesel/paraffin price is adjusted monthly to reflect oil’s price movements and the Rand’s value against the US$. Both have been moving in the wrong direction for some time.
5241 2018-07-03 14:23:00 Trump tweets, oil moves. Trump speaks, the world moves.

5272 2018-07-03 14:20:53 Thanks for listening, Anas. OPEC is not irrelevant, but today the U.S. imports more oil from Canada (38%) than all of the OPEC countries combined; huge change from the 1970s when OPEC supplied 70% of U.S. petro imports, & we've doubled domestic production. Held hostage? Not now.

5306 2018-07-03 14:18:42 You want NATO to spend more money on what? For the USA to attack more countries that have oil. Why did the USA not intervene in Africa when the 500+ women were taken. Because they don't have oil, period.
5307 2018-07-03 14:18:36 Why do oil changes take so long.... just change my oil and let’s gooooo
5308 2018-07-03 14:18:35 Nope it’s a stale oil after taste. Very bad!
5309 2018-07-03 14:18:32 Trading standards do this all the time. The state is entitled to curb charlatanry and fraudsters.
We're not discussing people merely espousing unpleasant views but people monetising those views by purporting to cure diseases that do not exist. In a phrase, snake oil.

5316 2018-07-03 14:17:37 I have a question, only one. The Romans between USA and Saudi Arabia, cant be only because of oil, looking how #Netanyahu supports them as well, pls tell me WHY? Why are u loving them so much ?
5317 2018-07-03 14:17:34 I just oiled my scalp with Jamaican black castor oil, which is normal. But with the way my head was itching, that was damn near a spiritual experience lol
5318 2018-07-03 14:17:27 I defer to James on those. But in general, extent of climate analysis depends on: whether oil pipeline triggers fed jurisdiction; if so, which agency; what's the agency's typical scope of review; who's in White House; what might that particular judicial circuit require on review

5327 2018-07-03 14:16:41 $XOM & $CVX are the big bloated integrated oil companies that as part of the XLE have contributed to its underperformance. I guess market thinks they will not have great margins/earnings until 2020ish. XLE/XOM/CVX will play catch up over next 2 years though

Venezuela's economy is still largely capitalist and the crash was due to their over reliance on oil exports to finance the economy.
5338 2018-07-03 14:15:53 He is. Otherwise, who could afford rents like that?

Midland, TX is highest in Texas at ~$3500/mo due to oil patch.
5339 2018-07-03 14:15:51 Here's an idea, cut off all oil and associated products from Rhode Island since we wouldn't want them to suffer from climate change.  See how well that works.
5340 2018-07-03 14:15:50 Tayler’s tip of the day. If your vehicle needs full synthetic oil changes (which typically run $60-$70 Midas has online coupons. Full synthetic oil changes for $50. You’re welcome
5341 2018-07-03 14:15:43 They are busy suing the oil companies now for being climate change co-conspirators to ruin the planet. Seriously..It was on the news this morning.

5346 2018-07-03 14:15:24 I remember the days when $75 per barrel oil would have been considered a steal.  This is called, "inflation due to a strong economy and heavy seasonal driving."

In other words, normal.

5355 2018-07-03 14:15:05 Afraid so. Ukog are basically using the natural pressure of the oil underneath the ground to ‘free flow’. The test is to see how much oil naturally flows to the surface. Fracking is the process of injecting liquid at high pressure to force open existing fissures and extract oil.

5357 2018-07-03 14:14:48 Kavanaugh is a Neocon. There was NO weapons of mass destruction. Remember when Iraq was a middle class country? The war was a mistake to privatize oil. Would the Kochs want somebody who was pro-oil?   hmmmm.

5446 2018-07-03 14:08:17 Who deals with refugee resettlement post-war? Army, Red Cross, etc., probably not State.  Who deals with nascent nationalists and rulers in the Arab world? Industrialists who went after the oil (the Prize), and perhaps OSS operatives who handled counterintelligence/resistance. 4/

Mr. President, you have got to do something to "Stop the Bleeding" per crippling Crude Oil / Too High Gas Pump Prices. #EffectsEVERYTHING

5452 2018-07-03 14:07:35 If you add oil to market it decreases price in current environment, if you ban exports then you decrease oil and it raises price like now.

5461 2018-07-03 14:06:40 Economy is like a Oil-Tanker. If you are steering in another direction, it lasts some time until it reacts. Todays good economic results is the result of Obamas policy.....lets see what is next in perhaps one year.....and where the Oil Tanker is then...

5467 2018-07-03 14:06:14 The Financial Services sector led the activity chart with 203.167 million shares exchanged for ₦1.138 billion. Services came next with 13.04 million shares traded for ₦0.029 billion, Conglomerates, Consumer Goods, Oil And Gas sectors followed in that order on the activity chart
5468 2018-07-03 14:05:59 Saudi's want to Control flow of Oil! That's what Trump cutting off Iran Deal is about! This way he could cut their Oil flow&give Saudi Control of oil in the Region! It was NEVER about the Nuclear Iran Deal! Iran is complying with the deal made/but it wouldn't made any difference.
5469 2018-07-03 14:05:58 Scotland has produced more oil in the past 30 years than the UAE, Kuwait, etc. Ann needs to ask what happened to the tax revenue. Not to mention other Scottish products such as whisky, gin, salmon, etc
5470 2018-07-03 14:05:55 So many others to choose from... Why not pick some others? Beyond the Marne, Gallipoli, Kaiserschleacht, Oil of Empires? ANYTHING but Fire and Ice for the 5th time...

5486 2018-07-03 14:04:33 There is oftentimes situations where oil exporters reduce production and/or other means that harms us economically. A President or Congress could decide that importimg foreign oil is more harm than good.
5487 2018-07-03 14:04:27 @NaturalBalance We we're really disappointed to find that you changed the recipe of your Catatouille Delectable Delights cat food.  It now has tuna oil, which it previously did not. It has made me weary to buy any of your other products, due to having a cat that is allergic.

5494 2018-07-03 14:04:09 Yeah but is it tied to having all your oil changes, tire rotations, mileage maintenance, etc done at said dealership, or could you drive off and come back never to be seen in 15 years with a blown engine?
5495 2018-07-03 14:04:08 Thank heavens for that.  Oprah would be a disaster.  Lest anyone forget, Oprah made a career of peddling fake science and promoting the careers of snake oil salesmen and charlatans.

5501 2018-07-03 14:03:52 We have 500,000 military personnel in other countries fighting bogus wars that aren't wars, they're protecting oil pipelines and poppy fields. But we can never have an army with nothing to do, right? Who wants an additional 500,000 people out of work on unemployment?

5504 2018-07-03 14:03:26 Cuba isn't democratic socialist and Venezuela had an over reliance on oil that did it in. Nice try comparing apples to oranges though. Maybe read up on the various forms of it before you try and comment on it

5549 2018-07-03 13:59:35 the most nutrient dense food i know of is organic grass feed cattle liver. by the way, isn’t olive oil mostly monounsaturated fats and omega-6’s? does that mean u have a super high omega-6 to omega-3 ratio? is all the omega-6 using up all the enzymes from omega-3 processing?

they developed a plan to diversify our economy out of the boom-bust cycle - a recovery built to last - for all Albertans, not just oil & gas

We're leading the nation, during & after a bad recession. It's a plan that works!

I am heartened to hear that the avocado trees were unmolested by Gen. Pruitt's troops, but their theft of the fuel oil will make this winter harsh. I hope the store of pristine Inauguration Programs will keep the fires going until Spring.

5590 2018-07-03 13:56:03 Makes sense, but trump doesn’t back him. He was congratulated by many leaders. Mexico will never turn to Venezuela. Venezuela relied primarily on oil. Mexico leads in exports in many fields and is one of the largest economies in Latin America. We’ll be okay

The pain that comes from indigested fat is similar to that by fibre as both will irritate the gut lining. Peppermint oil, ginger, mint tea, gripe water can help!

5620 2018-07-03 13:52:57 Nothing to do w/oil! It's about how they run their country! We can't change their President or policies any more than they can change ours.
5621 2018-07-03 13:52:56 I was running an energy services co in Nisku when oil collapsed in 2015. We, and many other shops, looked for ways to diversify - supports & know-how weren't there after decades of PC "leadership"

5622 2018-07-03 13:52:33 The U.S. President said Saudi Arabia will increase oil production, "maybe up to 2,000,000 barrels"  But the White House later said this is "spare capacity, which it will prudently use if and when necessary to ensure market balance." Meanwhile, Iran "zero"?

5639 2018-07-03 13:50:40 You seem to be suggesting that being rich in oil leads to a wealthy economy.

I am illustrating that one doesn't necessarily follow the other.

It wasn't too hard to work out.
5640 2018-07-03 13:50:32 That's also 0.001 gms per tonne.... Also oil isn't measured in tonnes, it's usually barrels or cubic metres.
5641 2018-07-03 13:50:09 Your climate plan does not hit the reduction target that your campaign claimed was insufficient.  Your climate plan gives 20% of that insufficiently ambitious carbon budget to the oil sands.  Meanwhile the other sectors have to reduce emissions ever further.

5673 2018-07-03 13:47:30 The reasoning is easy. To remain a Tier 1 economy, the UK needs to use its Tier 1 military power to destroy and loot Tier 1 independent oil and gas producing countries so it can remain a Tier 1 economy and a Tier 1 military power.
5674 2018-07-03 13:47:28 Yep.  That sucked indeed.  Our new house uses heating oil and has a backup wood boiler to run the radiant system, and is plumbed to switch to propane if we want to get a new furnace.  We may put in a wood stove for fun and comfort.  Nothing like a fire to cheer you up.

5729 2018-07-03 13:42:15 That's what we have in common; native New Yorker (transplanted). Snake oil salesman is exactly right.  Except even too nice for him, actually.  He's SO much worse!

5731 2018-07-03 13:42:11 Trump would never expose the Saudi's he needs their oil too badly. He just asked them to up production by 2 million barrels a day. They drop production & our economy stalls, will never happen.
5732 2018-07-03 13:42:08 They are running oil companies by market cap. $useg could be next.

5735 2018-07-03 13:42:06 Rising trade (in absolute terms and as a share of global output growth) has been a major driver of the recent recovery. So it's fair to imagine that global growth will slow. Demand for oil (and price) will fall.
5736 2018-07-03 13:42:04 My boobs can't handle this weather, bring on the coconut oil and deodorant. Just give me a reduction already

5740 2018-07-03 13:41:47 I think Norwegian is going to be in trouble because that what Michael O'Leary the CEO of Ryanair told in Bloomberg TV on interview about that oil prices will go up. It's good that I bought a cheap tickets from Ireland to Poland to visit family with my parents in two months time.

5743 2018-07-03 13:41:27 You’re the expert here but I’d bet large amounts of money every single company hedges oil
5744 2018-07-03 13:41:25 Even being an outsider, Trump seems just as willing as any President to topple governments. Pence or Hillary would do the same. We really need a system overhaul, more parties w/ more candidates and to get money out of politics. Energy, oil, and military/weapons $ rules supreme.

5770 2018-07-03 13:39:34 As what I've heard, China will continue to buy Iranian oil. Russia, China, and Iran should create an alliance from monetary to security not just to defend from aggression but also to be sanction-proof.

5785 2018-07-03 13:38:36 4. Current subsidies go to the companies - oil, electricity etc. Why are we doing that? Liberalize the markets and if you want to support the poor, give them vouchers. When they actually consume, they are refunded. INDIA does that for grains. So no cabal benefits.
5786 2018-07-03 13:38:28 There will be a record number of travelers on the road for the 4th of July holiday. What better way to celebrate our independence than filling up with fuel containing American-made #ethanol that reduces our reliance on foreign oil!

5846 2018-07-03 13:33:44 Also violating the Iran agreement (you didn't pull out you VIOLATED it) has caused less oil competition which lead to increased gas prices. Also Iran has now continued weaponized nuke production bc the deal that prevented them is null now
5847 2018-07-03 13:33:35 What cars requires such frequent service intervals? Lambos only require service every 5k miles, at ~500 USD and an oil change should only be ~1k USD. Ferrari is similar.

5871 2018-07-03 13:31:35 NO you are without thought, ignore the problem and do nothing? the solution is to get other countries to improve the conditions for the people that live there or not do business with them, Obama buddy Chavez wasted all the money from Venezuela oil production- thats not our fault.

During the 3rd Battle of Charlottesville we captured enemy caches of citronella oil, Tiki torches, and Japanese pornography.

Also, Trumpistani leader Richard Spencer was captured as he attempted to escape into a local Walmart dressed as a woman.

5893 2018-07-03 13:30:11 Bullish sentiment on oil is very high. Oil is near or at a peak & will be heading lower soon. XLE is reflecting that likely reality. Much better setups in precious metals (mining) & semiconductor stocks.

5901 2018-07-03 13:29:40 as a metaphor for data, as in Facebook is a harvester of, and when Facebook discloses improper data breaches, it is akin to an oil spill, where the costs of cleanup are externalized to the owner of the data rather than facebook?

5917 2018-07-03 13:28:06 careful not to put vinegar instead of oil again
5918 2018-07-03 13:28:00 Most of us perform regular maintenance on our vehicles… oil changes, fluid top-up, tire rotations... to keep our cars running well. We need to apply this preventative maintenance to our bodies as well.
5919 2018-07-03 13:27:49 Obama-era legacy is in tact... Trump has 0 deals thus far...Fake deal with N Korea, which has been exposed, no trade deals, just trade wars. Oil is at 75 a barrel today. inflation booming, just crazy

5922 2018-07-03 13:27:23 Iran exports crude oil and condensate at a rate of 2.5 million bpd. Taking this off the market, an Iranian official said earlier this month, “in a period of a few months is impossible.”
5923 2018-07-03 13:27:19 The zinc is uncoated, so not reef safe. Plus has coconut oil [comedogenic as heck] and the zinc oxide isn't 15-20%.
Guess I'll keep lookin

5934 2018-07-03 13:25:57 When I was a kid my mum used to spend one day a week with olive oil on her hair, under a towel. This was back when you could only buy olive oil in chemists. Dry curly hair runs riot through my family.

5939 2018-07-03 13:25:37 I seriously thought about getting a Chevy Bolt - all electric, 238 mile range - never get an oil change again. 40K, $7500 tax credit, costs 7 dollars for a full charge. I ended up with an Accord Hybrid, but will be going all electric next year.
5940 2018-07-03 13:25:31 Getting my oil changed and they came to get me to show me a problem on my car and said we can do it, it will be about $350....uh no leave it I’ll tell my dad!

5943 2018-07-03 13:25:04 Oil in the region is the obvious driver for this constant meddling in the Middle East. Israel is the less obvious but more powerful influence. Why? What could Israel possibly hold over the American government that force our position on Iran, Palestine etc. I wonder.
5944 2018-07-03 13:25:00 I was watching some cooking show on tv and they used it and it was actually oil. I was shocked.

5949 2018-07-03 13:24:47 Good Morning...oil is up to $75 Bucks a barrel today (3 year high)...Last year it was about $44.  Free story idea if anybody wants to cover it.
5950 2018-07-03 13:24:44 I think that requires proof. This is at the least, debatable. We bring war and destabilization to other regions so we can make money on oil. We used two nukes. We let our own people die for profit margins. We let kids go hungry while we fill landfills with food. /1

5960 2018-07-03 13:23:57 Thanks I read that there is no practical sustainable palm oil production no matter how supposedly ethically sourced it is. Palm oil is being grown on deforested land and thebsupple chain so unclear and corrupt it’s difficult to verify ergo none of it is 100% sustainable.

5973 2018-07-03 13:22:23 Your original point is spot on. Beyond that memory is terribly flawed, and for the white majority, then much younger and not necessarily politically aware, many injustices were invisible, while US still had highest standard of living and was a net exporter of oil.
5974 2018-07-03 13:22:19 Shownunu this time add oil only to the pan >.<

5979 2018-07-03 13:21:37  I know! Second most shameful moment of my life.  Number one was a few weeks ago when @chrissyteigen called out truffle oil on sushi. The truffle trio at Osaka was my fav. I feel like everything I thought I knew about food must be wrong. 
5980 2018-07-03 13:21:30 EFF your economics and economic thinking is WRONG. SA fuel prices are driven by two factors: a weaker Rand (due to US interest rate increases) & higher Crude oil prices, which have risen every month since Feb.

5984 2018-07-03 13:21:16 You won't hear me argue against a variety of renewable energy pursuits, as long as it's the free market pursuing it and not tax dollars.  However, until the worlds machinery are all switched over, the would will continue to need oil, barrels and barrels of it.
5985 2018-07-03 13:21:02 For local earners, yes. This would translate an increase in cost of goods — basic would be bc of oil. Given mababa peso value natin, there will be price hikes. Not just for transpo (jeeps, Grab cars), but also factory machines (run by oil) that produces goods tataas cost nila

5991 2018-07-03 13:20:35 I find lavender oil really helps my Maxwell Smart. Just make sure it is a good quality one, and just a tiny amount. I usually put it on my hands, rub them together and then pet the fluffy dude.
5992 2018-07-03 13:20:35 Designed it? Did WM drain the oil fields? Did WM deplete our tax base?
5993 2018-07-03 13:20:31 Use essential oil diffusers instead of air fresheners and candles. Aerosols can be terrible for air quality and candles can be sending wack ingredients into the air you're breathing! I love "Citrus Dream" from @SajeWellness it's just so yum!

YOU CANT JUST PUT LATEX ON OIL.

SCRAPING PAINT FAILURE IS KEY.

6159 2018-07-03 13:08:30 When the carrabba's change to an IHOP in side. The table sat low to the floor because the low ceilings. And I cant pour my own olive oil any more. The food is ok I guess but it taste more like mall pizza. Not bad just not worth the wait and the time it took.

Don't sleep on this one! This was the one that started the oil trend, over 2.60 and this will be explosive imo!
6161 2018-07-03 13:08:18 The Padron, straight in a pan, a little olive oil & sea salt, 5 mins, then munch. What about a nice hot Mexican chilli sauce for the rest - whizz up in a blender with a splash of vinegar, garlic, onion, lemon, oil & salt - no cooking, lasts a while in a re-sealable bottle.

Why. Why. WHY.

6168 2018-07-03 13:07:46 U.S. Oil averages 12% profit and the US gov takes 18% to 24% in gas tax for doing absolutely nothing for that revenue. So the gov makes 6% to 12% more profit than the oil companies themselves on gas sales for doing absolutely nothing.

Moral is low.  Everyone is on CBD oil, but supplies are low.  Our regiment commander brought us whipped mocha chai lattes, iced, grande, which cheered the troops.  But as there were no straws, hopes dwindled.  Yours forever,

6176 2018-07-03 13:06:51 Oil is a commodity, everyone needs it.  If America truly puts its effort into confronting Chinese trade abuses, China cannot win.  The trade imbalance is so massive with many more components of this abuse beyond just the real dollars.  It's a battle the U.S must win.
6177 2018-07-03 13:06:48 Egypt has become an important player in the Mediterranean. Zohr, discovered by Eni in 2015, plays a key role in helping Egypt to avoid the need to import liquefied natural gas (LNG), according to the Italian oil and gas major.

6187 2018-07-03 13:06:04 Fuck the price of oil, fracking destroys all of our water sources. The TPP was not about free trade, it was a corporate giveaway.

6219 2018-07-03 13:02:41 How did all that biomass get there? It had to be collected up and quickly buried. Compressed and heated to form into the oil and coal that we have today. The process does not take millions of years. It can happen in less than 100 years.
6220 2018-07-03 13:02:37 Workers cant be paid as at when due because oil price crashed. The government is therefore handicapped. Nigeria is oil and not production and that is why we are poor. Most Nigerians are socialists - bring and share kind of thing- therefore, your views are quite popular.

6280 2018-07-03 12:55:19 True, however fuel tariffs & taxes are lopped on by governments, #Botswana buys oil from #opec their oil transport costs are greater than ours yet their fuel price is R10/litre & #SouthAfrica's is about to hit over R16/litre.

6286 2018-07-03 12:54:46 Stealing hardly requires any commitment to production of goods and services. In fact, so long the foreign companies are exporting oil, the Nigerian government can afford to run. Therefore, in the eyes of the government, the citizens are a nuisance cos they can do without us.

6414 2018-07-03 12:38:43 Iran will allow private companies to export crude oil, part of a strategy to counter U.S. sanctions, and is urging fellow OPEC members,
6415 2018-07-03 12:38:43 “This African nation is 'about to have an oil boom'” Now that oil cost half of what it did a few years ago and the US and most developed nations are using less and less of it, is there still such a thing as an oil boom?
6416 2018-07-03 12:38:42 How many days worth of the US military's oil consumption will banning plastic straws net us, exactly? And how many people proposing this are passing laws punishing companies that full on dump their fishing nets in the ocean, the largest source of plastic pollution?

6418 2018-07-03 12:37:51 Riiiiight thats why were asking Middle Eastern nations to increase oil production, so we can "Steal" it from them. Didn't think this tweet very far through clearly.

6423 2018-07-03 12:36:57 So you are ok importing oil from Saudi Arabia and disregarding their deplorable human rights record? Toxic waste left behind....don't believe the eco-terrorists say. They are bought and paid for demonstrators with one goal....limit Canada economically.

Riches to Rags-How Socialism Killed Venezuela
Just a few short decades ago, Venezuela was a prosperous nation.The country’s wealth is mostly based on oil.
So how could such an important, wealthy country fall so far? In a word, socialism. DONT BE DAFT, Sarah

Yogurt, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, garlic (lots of it), Dill, Cucumber (stiffed), salt and last but not least, white wine vinegar! Simple as that! You ll have the most amazing tzatziki!Simplicity! 
6429 2018-07-03 12:36:18 I guess. "Bully nation" because the US has a thing for admiring oppressive dictatorships and overthrowing dozens upon dozens of random countries that didn't attack us all in the name of oil and "democracy".

6433 2018-07-03 12:35:35 The "illegal character" of U.S withdrawal from the Iran deal - and the subsequent illegal (oil) sanctions it imposed - has consequences. 

It legally and morally entitles #Iran to take whatever countermeasures it deems necessary to protect its interests.

6435 2018-07-03 12:35:15 Even if another political party takes over, oil prices will keep doing it's own thing. SA cannot influence fuel prices
6436 2018-07-03 12:35:14 I thought Iran were your buddies,  now because they won't fill your demand for oil,  you bask them,  disgraceful autocrat!
6437 2018-07-03 12:35:12 I mean, one friend spent eight years in a stagnant position at an oil and gas company, but sneezed and got a job with Apple in Austin.

6444 2018-07-03 12:34:43 Today the $ jumped to 7.10 ld a $ (ystrdy 6.90) as news that fuel tankers have been stopped frm loading in oil ports hits the market. Food prices expected to rise again. #Tripoli #Libya

6446 2018-07-03 12:34:32 From behind a beaded curtain, you hear a creak. An oil lamp lies discarded nearby.

6454 2018-07-03 12:33:58 Who are US to tell the whole world that Iran is wrong. How can you prove Iran is wrong? Why US acts like a dictator ? Why can’t other countries buy Oil from Iran ? If US has a problem that doesn’t mean the whole world has it. All these questions have one Big Answer - US wants Oil
6455 2018-07-03 12:33:45 @guarnaschelli Hello. Why do chefs say "cut on the bias" is there a nuance that "cut on an angle" not cover. Also is it heat the pan add the oil or add the oil heat the pan. Thank you. Love you on @FoodNetwork and @CookingChannel

6459 2018-07-03 12:33:32 It’s definitely a signpost for something.  You could argue America dropped the ball after the Berlin Wall game down by opting for oil power rather than intl goodwill, and 9/11 was when we got bit back.
6460 2018-07-03 12:33:31 I found an old, and I mean probably really old, bottle of Satsuma perfume oil in my apartment. I used some today. It still smells exactly like it did when I bought it at least 10ish years ago.
6461 2018-07-03 12:33:11 Because, his job, as defined by Trump, is to pave the way for big oil to do whatever they want and ultimately line Russian pockets.

6471 2018-07-03 12:31:42 Thinking TA made a geopolitical error in marginalizing 2 OPEC nations while US production is hitting growth constraints. Oil is rising irrespective of global growth trends which isn’t good for the US & global economy at large. Will he back off Iran or let oil crush the consumer?

6484 2018-07-03 12:29:59 Right now the president of Iran is threatening the world that if they could not sell oil no one can use #Hormuz_Strait to ship oil.

6494 2018-07-03 12:29:11 And if you think we get involved with countries like Iran and Iraq out of be goodness of our government’s “hearts” to save their people, you are fucking deluded. We do it for oil.

6497 2018-07-03 12:29:05 I also love the other threat of not trading way Scotland once it leaves next year hahaha works both ways aye hehe we have the fish the oil the  Vast sea that will keep us in energy. Immigration will fund our old age and bring us  a new generation of Eu scots #ScotRef
6498 2018-07-03 12:28:55 Except that the oil is only 40% of the fuel price the rest are taxes and levies to pay such things as hiring of chairs for RAF at R1666 per chair per month
6499 2018-07-03 12:28:52 You have to make the battery once. Oil you have to keep making.
Batteries' raw materials can be recycled when they are end of life. Oil is used up.
Your comparison makes no sense.
6500 2018-07-03 12:28:45 So why does POTUS demand from OPEC to ramp up their production if the USA don´t need their foreign oil? Also if the prices drop, US oil firms are losing money on sales. (and why the heck should countries put on sanctions and travel ban lists, support US interests)

6507 2018-07-03 12:27:58 Exfoliation Scrup- mix equal 1-2 tbsp Kosher Salt and Olive oil. (I add 1-2 drops of Cedarwood, Rosemary, and Vetiver oil.) Do your entire body 1-2 a week before you shower- the oils penetrate more deeply after you exfoliate, amplifying and in some cases/days replacing lotion.

6512 2018-07-03 12:27:01 I'd rather see him promote the alternative energy market, but we all know this would never happen - I get where you're going here, but oil doesn't need saving, we should be working on alternatives so we can leave it where it is

6517 2018-07-03 12:26:16 I have no idea. I don't hold it. I always assumed that is was predominantly oil but I never thoroughly researched it - I've only listened to a couple of presentations and skip read the website.
6518 2018-07-03 12:26:13 If you mean Trump will save the oil market by driving oil prices higher the answer is "Yes".
6519 2018-07-03 12:26:08 The oil under the Weald will be coming out, regardless whether you are for or against it. An oil discovery larger than the North Sea field, online so cheaper to extract, naturally fractured and with Brexit looming large etc etc - no government can ignore this.

6527 2018-07-03 12:24:25 Eish! Been wanting to say, but lacked courage. It's the oil that has gone up 65% since the beginning of the year. However the disparity in petrol price with our neighbours who get their fuel from us is the reason for my hesitation. R11. 00 in Botswana and R12. 00 in Lesotho.
6528 2018-07-03 12:23:53 Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise them up. If they have sinned, they will be forgiven.

6697 2018-07-03 12:03:34 It's Blocks 4 & 5, govt docs confirm. Oil Minister Mukena wants to declassify all of Block 4 which lies entirely within the park (1,320 square km) and the part of Block 5 which is inside (400-ish square km). That'd be declassification of 21.5% of the park. Plus c.40% of Salonga.

6705 2018-07-03 12:01:57 Yes I'm sure.  The US bombing campaign in Syria began in 2014 (although claims put clandestine bombing a year earlier). Russia intervened a year after the offical start of the US bombing campaign. It was only after the Russian intervention that the US began hitting oil facilities

6727 2018-07-03 11:59:24 I sell it now; it’s called UltraCell. 

Quick backstory: my mom is a massage therapist who sells essential oils, but a friend of hers got her into selling CBD oil. Since nobody I know in my town sells it, I signed up to get CBD oil for cheaper cost for personal use. I can DM you!

6737 2018-07-03 11:58:20 BFB misleading again. 8 year freeze on fuel& petrol price is still lower that the £1.37 of 2012(In the EU) This is due to the fall in crude oil from the highs of 2012 of $111.26 to todays price of $78. Hence the loss in tax revenue! Add the embargo in Iran and prices are rising
6738 2018-07-03 11:58:19 What about politicians leading the way on this and taking a pay cut to help aid the NHS funds? Maybe hey could forego their expenses? I thought the cost of oil had recently declined, yet the British motorist is the ‘easy target’ when it comes to raising taxes!

6754 2018-07-03 11:56:19 As to seed oil, I would say that humans have never consumed such high quantities of oil/fat throughout our evolutionary history. But this goes for all fats including the like of butter and lard.

6988 2018-07-03 11:28:05 That is not accurate. Oil Quest doesn’t have the permit. They are not a subsidiary of Soco either, although a son of Soco’s chairman seems to have ties to it.

6990 2018-07-03 11:28:00 Not defending, but I have to wonder how many of those lawsuits were actually filed or if the company would really pursue to trial. That shit’s expensive, and most of these ppl are “judgement-proof” so i doubt the company would get its attys fees. 
But evil gonna evil.

Note to self : if you want to cook a fresh wakame, make sure to wash it more than ten times. 

It stinks.

7013 2018-07-03 11:25:04 It’s a big challenge to get westsyd to be loud and present when they are not happy-  our diversity has a lot to do with that as well as not as many “well to do” retirees with time to protest.  We keep squeaking maybe we get the oil
7014 2018-07-03 11:25:03 What is the trend, say over the last five years? As electricity consumption and LPG use increase, the use of charcoal is gonna decline. That is why I've been advocating for an oil refinery, even a modular one to reducs inflation, forex and interest rate as current account improve
7015 2018-07-03 11:24:59 Some digital agencies had it too good. Clients now know what they are buying so the snake oil salesmen are probably dropping out of the market. There are also lots more agencies at the £800,000-£2million turnover mark, which means more competition.

7041 2018-07-03 11:22:11 I think its 56 rupees unless you follow some other exchange system. One of the major factor in deciding oil price is the amount of consumption as it decides, how much subsidies the state is giving. That's why USA, Brazil, India are having drastically different price than BD, Pak.
7042 2018-07-03 11:22:10 Remember 2008 & 2011-13 how many oil speculators (some very impressive hedge funds) were betting on rising oil & got obliterated being wrong at a suprise turn? Same happened to silver & iron ore spec's. Few inv use common sense - just follow momentum story and risk a lot.

7163 2018-07-03 11:08:40 True. Yet if he continues his saber rattling in the ME the price of oil will be going up and up.
7164 2018-07-03 11:08:32 "Your throne, O God, will last for ever and ever, and righteousness will be the scepter of your kingdom" (Hebrews 1:8).
Jesus' government will be just because righteousness is His scepter. Because Jesus loves what is right and hates wickedness, He is anointed with the oil of joy.

7170 2018-07-03 11:06:59 Iran's authority isn't related to the sale of oil.
Indeed, oil is the least costly source of income for Iran, not only a source of income.
Iran, like Saudi or UAE, will not be destroyed by cutting off their oil sales or their US support over a week.
Iran has learned independence.

We need to find solutions to diminishing supply of fossil fuels while protecting the planet for future generations.

7198 2018-07-03 11:02:48 Yesterday, US stock markets ended in positive territory after a rough start. It always feels good for the first trading day of a fiscal year to be positive. 

Today, US stock futures are up 0.45% with Europe higher and Asia mixed. Oil is $74.90 with gold at $1,248. Sounds good.
7199 2018-07-03 11:02:13 using SPR to reduce oil prices is a very bad idea because it will only delay the much needed investment in the industry, if the investment does not arrive early then the risk of higher oil prices increases even more, better to suffer a little now then deal with a disaster later

7241 2018-07-03 10:55:35 UK only makes money from oil and gas at the point the end consumer (you and I) pay for it.
GVA ensures the wealth created therein is distributed throughout UK.

The 'unknown region' issue is no longer, but it didn't affect Scottish income ( on paper)
7242 2018-07-03 10:54:59 95+ if you include the Labour sea grab of 6000 sq miles.

And lets not forget the Labour heartlands of the Greater Clyde , oil and gas denied us to keep Trident squatting on it.
7243 2018-07-03 10:54:57 How are the Scots managing their deficit these days ? It was pretty chunky £15b 15/16 - 10% of GDP compared with UK 3.8%. You must be thanking god the oil price is moving up - well at least until the Saudis turn the tap back on again!!
7244 2018-07-03 10:54:44 100%. We could talk about plastic bags coming from oil, add in oil spills etc. Or plastic bags breaking down into tiny particles bring eaten by plankton which then get eaten by fish who then go sterile, or get eaten by humans passing on the chems. I'd prefer hemp bags tbh.

7409 2018-07-03 10:30:32 #Libya is a rentier state. That innately influenced many Libyans to expect #NOC to be responsible of #oil production but also wealth-sharing (doesn't help that Ghadaffi hammered us w/ that rhetoric).

Wealth-sharing is contentious by nature. Let alone in our environment...

7415 2018-07-03 10:29:42 @GasBuddyGuy hey, oil production is increasing - does that mean a decrease in gas prices?
7416 2018-07-03 10:29:41 So in the case that large scale CCS and negative emissions don't materialize, new oil production will probably take us beyond 2 degrees?

7418 2018-07-03 10:29:25 Cowen's energy team: "Demand growth is showing fatigue from higher #oil price, and as such we expect #OPEC to make supply more visible. Supply outages have increased the price floor in the near-term, while demand remains more important medium term"
7419 2018-07-03 10:29:22 Agreed! Incidentally, I only discovered a few weeks ago that my car has an alarm. I’ve owned it for 9 years.

I discovered this by opening the bonnet while the car was locked to check the oil.

Incidentally the alarm is under the bonnet and flipping loud when you’re stood there!

7421 2018-07-03 10:29:21 I'm with Panda and I'm mad! Their electricity is from 100% renewables. I asked them why they needed to put prices up as oil and gas were not used to generate it. This is what they said:

7424 2018-07-03 10:28:54 aye mate, putting that on my to-do list. I have a suspicion that the gateways are where the oil rigs are at, but I'll have to get back to you on that.

7427 2018-07-03 10:28:39 Thank you for pointing out that concern. Maintaining such capacity is very very costly, specially if you keep it for long time, like current level which was available more than 10 years. Thanks God we have a smart and prudent oil minister like Mr. K.Faleh.

7434 2018-07-03 10:27:14 Totally agree - but we will have to be patient to see if it’s blackmail or not! 

My hope is that this is a catalyst for a new deal on oil wealth sharing. Rather than a return or replication of the corrupt system in Tripoli.

7436 2018-07-03 10:27:04 The reason for attacking Gaddafi when they did was defense of the petrodollar. He was going to trade oil for gold. They not only needed to stop that, they needed him to die barbarically in order to send a message to other leaders of oil-rich nations not to even think about it.
7437 2018-07-03 10:26:55 Don't for once allow political class to manipulate you. Those within this group are manipulating our religious leaders, our youths, and our future. On many occasions, they oil dispute in the society purposely to divide  Nigeria more.  #Nigeria #Fulani #Religion @APCUKingdom

7512 2018-07-03 10:15:18 I think Sanallah took things personally because of frustration (& global #oil prices went up too)... He tried to keep #NOC somewhat away from the 'institutional dichotomy' in #Libya despite knowing the consequences of that. Caught up to him now, it's an unsustainable status quo.
7513 2018-07-03 10:15:15 The problem is Sanallah isn’t really addressing the elephant in the room - gross corruption of oil revenues from the current set up. 

He could be presenting ideas  for unifying the NOC and more transparent mechanisms for oil revenue distribution.

Trump you need to utilize our oil reserves to get the price down then buy back lower.
7547 2018-07-03 10:09:15 Having the dollar as lead currency is where the US makes REAL money. Wonder if the oil dollar connects to the "zero Iran oil" sanction from Trump. Because there were already negotiations to pay for Iranian oil with e.g. Renminbi or Euro to keep up Iran Nuclear Deal.

7549 2018-07-03 10:08:35 There are tankers backed up in many cities waiting to unload. Many thought the glut of shale &  Bakken made the Middle East irrelevant re: oil. King Salman & others have said production increases are coming. #DontGetIt. #OilTraders #HardToBelieve
7550 2018-07-03 10:07:58 We sure do! We also have neck oil, Camden Wit and much more on tap!
7551 2018-07-03 10:07:45 Good monsoon if not flood to boost rural growth. High oil prices' drag on the economy will be partly compensated. Adverse impact of trade war going to be settled with impending Indo-US discussion.

Would you please tell me if the dishes marked as vegan on your menu are cooked using the same oil as non-vegan dishes, or if they're cooked, for example, using the same utensils & pans without being washed beforehand.

With gratitude :)
7555 2018-07-03 10:06:59 @Ben_garrod There are no Soco offices in U. S. A., but their seems to be many in England. Demonstrate. And dump oil in front of their offices. Or and Find banks that invest in Soco and demonstrate. Write, call, whatever it takes. DRC Congo's embassy should see a lot of action.

7558 2018-07-03 10:06:05 I didn't make these ones, but I make mine exactly like that. I am yet to do mine later tonight for supper. Take the dough with your hand & when you put it in hot cooking oil, the dough should be squeezed between your index finger & thumb.That way the fat cake comes out like that.
7559 2018-07-03 10:06:04 One time somebody wanted to match me a blunt for a dab. Which is cool, I’m pretty generous with my oil usually. But this man rolls up, I shit you not l, the skinniest blunt I’ve ever seen. That shit had more rillo than weed. Looking like a fucking noodle. Get the fuck out here.

7561 2018-07-03 10:05:44 My dearest Mathilda 

This is not the IHOB I knew before the war, my darling. They only had sweet potato fries - and they came lightly dressed in parmesan and truffle oil. They valet-parked the car. For the love of God, the water was organically farmed. #secondcivilwarletters
7562 2018-07-03 10:05:40 Just to throw back that well worn answer. Nothing happens in a snap. This is complicated but tiny brains cannot comprehend that. Things are deteriorating as the oil tanker that is Brexit changes course and heads for the rocks.
7563 2018-07-03 10:05:05 Agree, diplomatic lines are probably running hot everywhere. Adhering to the 0 oil sanction would cost India dearly, because at the moment they pay with stuff for Iranian oil, e.g. crops. On the free market India has to pay with the dollar, which will make it more costly.

7570 2018-07-03 10:02:00 @LeeCamp there are a couple dozen families in murka who have profited trillions. I hope they are named in the law suit. probably a detailed study of standard oil and it's offspring will snare most of them. 
stand up murka this is your moment!!
7571 2018-07-03 10:01:52 Many thanks. Will they also investigate who is dumping bags of rubbish there including what looks like bottles of used cooking oil?

7578 2018-07-03 10:00:39 MINING FACT!
Oil rigs can cause serious pollution.
Oil rigs drill for oil far out in the ocean. Underneath the rock lie oil and gas reserves. Sometimes the oil spills, which can pollute the water and kill sea life.

7625 2018-07-03 09:49:28 Agreed... To be honest it's hard to speculate because #UNSC documents a lot of what the Emiratis do but never does much about it.

But precedent shows that #oil is a red line (Morning Glory ~2014) and w/ recent signs #US is showing more interest in #Libya, I doubt #UAE would try.

7681 2018-07-03 09:37:32 Did you create impasto or oil brushes?
7682 2018-07-03 09:37:09 #ROCK Prospects look good here and has been overlooked by the market so far because of the interest around oil plays at the moment

7684 2018-07-03 09:36:51 "there was the fact that Russia clearly intended to put more oil on the market regardless of the outcome of the meetings in Vienna." The increased oil prices plus increased demand due to Iran sanctions clearly profit Russia. Is #Trump a lackey of #Putin?

Those who want to go green should fund it, not fuel poverty survivors
7689 2018-07-03 09:36:17 telling someone to appreciate something they don’t appreciate is like saying add water to oil. as much as i want to appreciate something, it just turns into guilt.

“why didn’t you appreciate sooner?”
“is it really that hard to just be grateful?”
“this is just obligation.”

7949 2018-07-03 08:49:41 Haha thanks... Was applying for a position & was afraid they'd dig up dirt in my acc. Nevertheless, my social media managers are burning the midnight oil to restore normal services. 
7950 2018-07-03 08:49:36 i mean i'd LOVE to have an oil slick again but man... money LOL
7951 2018-07-03 08:49:16 Fitting on a toilet. What we're talking about could be the future for this country. It's like 21st century oil. But the government has to own it. They need to be smart about this one.

7953 2018-07-03 08:48:47 The USA are in bed with the Saudis’ the same people who are alleged to be behind 9/11. Oil is thicker than the blood of its fallen citizens I guess.

7955 2018-07-03 08:48:16 From my position let me tell you seriously but #AlSisi_administration done a massive remarkable progress in the #energy & #oil & #gas sector in egypt last 5 years, its not kissing ass quote but truth quote for them .
7956 2018-07-03 08:48:14 IRANIAN PRESIDENT ROUHANI WARNS THAT REGIONAL OIL EXPORTS MAY BE IMPACTED IF U.S. PRESSURE TO STOP IRANIAN OIL CONTINUES (AP)
7957 2018-07-03 08:47:48 Is (1) your reading of his comments saying "see what will happen" if Iranian exports stop but other oil exports from the region continue?

7959 2018-07-03 08:47:40 Hahahaha Oil and gas ayah diaaaa.
7960 2018-07-03 08:47:38 Besides being a horrible "tradition" that used oil will pollute the soil and when that young man bathes all that oil will go into waste water later dumped into our water systems. Adding to the generations of disasters to environment here. Same with balloons.
7961 2018-07-03 08:47:27 By implementing the latest advances in #cladding, #gswksa is extending the usable life of #Aramco’s network of pipes, thereby reducing production costs.

7974 2018-07-03 08:44:08 Oil prices are headed up and will be $90 a barrel my midterm election. With Asian economy slowing, Dollar over heating and deficit ballooning all while the US takes in 15% less corporate tax dollars. So glad the Trump domestic agenda is getting implemented while shit hits fan.

7981 2018-07-03 08:42:19 Poison ivy oil can stay active for over two years.. If it is on your shoes, or clothes that are not washed.. guess what?  Wash really good within 10 minutes of exposure.  Wash like you are cleaning grease off of yourself... Zanfel is expensive but works.  Vinegar kills the plant

7999 2018-07-03 08:39:33 The US did next to nothing about ISIS until the Russian intervention.  During 2 years of alleged bombing it didn't hit one single ISIS oil convoy and ISIS advanced everywhere. Within 2 months of Russian bombings the oil convoys were gone and ISIS in retreat.
8000 2018-07-03 08:39:30 I only have olive oil. The avocados have wilted. Real whipped cream must do. Honey dew over cantaloupe. Repeat. Whipped cream must do.
8001 2018-07-03 08:39:29 To be profitable and an alternative to oil.. so to protect their market share in the energy market OPEC pushed their prices down to force a reduction in natural gas in the US.. and as a result keep the US dependent on them.. 

We literally can't run away from the oil price

8006 2018-07-03 08:38:16 OK, gotcha on inflation point. Piece says £1bn year 1. Obviously escalates and cumulates. Tories had economist @andrew_lilico suggesting it went down as oil price went up and vice versa. I'm all for escalator. Just pointing out it doesn't come close to paying NHS rise short term.
8007 2018-07-03 08:38:02 Every kid of fuel used, even natural gas at some point in their production process is also a function of the oil price. Which is why OPEC increased supply in 2014 & the oil price declined to like $45/bbl because the natural gas producers in the states also need a higher oil price

8020 2018-07-03 08:36:05 If we’re talking alternative medicine, CBD oil is a nice product but it’s not a substitute to what buprenorphine does for me not even Lyrica is. (I use all 3) Feeling lucky to be Dutch today... what a sh*t situation this is
8021 2018-07-03 08:35:21 how short is it?  ever tried castor oil? sometimes it isn't that it doesn't grow, it's that breakage occurs at a high rate, faster than growth.  bah, I'm sure you've tried a ton of stuff already.  Don't mind me. I'm trying to grow my hair too and worked in beauty supply for 4+yrs

8023 2018-07-03 08:35:19 It has been clear the oil prices were going to be a problem ever since the orb incident. Trump asleep at the wheel or tweeting or at the golf course or at a rally or speaking with one of our foreign adversaries and so on. Welcome 2007 as this mirrors the last time GOP was in WH.
8024 2018-07-03 08:35:18 Because their fuel is also derived from oil.. so it's cost of production is also a function of the oil price and the currency... 

They're currently building a plant in Nigeria, I think it's to deal with their exposure to international oil prices.

8237 2018-07-03 07:55:45 Closing the oil ports to extort Tripoli is a very different game now from when Jadhran did it in 2013-14. Today, foreign governments (particularly US) ultimately decide who the 'legitimate' CBL governor is. Current port closures aim to exert pressure via IOCs & Western states.

8276 2018-07-03 07:49:24 India should not stop oil from Iran. In fact use the position to better deals :

8299 2018-07-03 07:44:07 This is brilliant. Just the headline. How do they manage to achieve this perfect society?...oh, they have £1trn oil fund. Easy!!!...all a country need to do is 
1. Have a small population; &
2. Find a £1trn cavern of oil sitting in the ground.

Easy!  

(Lucky people indeed!).
8300 2018-07-03 07:43:58 1. We have a perfectly fine printing press 2. Oil wealth balloons our GDP, but the income is not put into the yearly budget. If we’d spent 2% of GDP, we’d have spent more per capita than the US.

8311 2018-07-03 07:41:47 On that we agree. I'd rather they didn't discuss our issues.Whenever they do, it has rarely been for our benefit but to serve theirs. From the select committees on scramble for Africa to debates on British involvement in Nigerian civil war to protect their oil installations

8335 2018-07-03 07:37:03 We understand markets but SA inability to respond to them without  increases stems from poor gov. fiscal policies, tax rates on oil, sale of reserves & profits needed by corporates. OPEC increases have impact but the public is taking the punch 'cos no gov. leeway left.
8336 2018-07-03 07:37:02 The interim govt has no moral power to increase oil prices rather they should minimises their personal  expenses.
8337 2018-07-03 07:36:57 As you rightly write: "Once upon a time..." Petrolium has in history frequently been an object used to start wars (Iraq, Iran/Persia), make politics etc. One should look at those who dictate/manipulate the oil production & price behind the scenes.

8346 2018-07-03 07:34:11 (Sorry - wash all bedding with tea tree oil) Plus, a flea lifecycle is around 2-4 weeks, so in a fortnight, you’ll probably need to treat everything again (Tho some sprays last.) You WILL still see fleas in that time, but the stuff will kill them.
8347 2018-07-03 07:34:07 The oil wasnt until 2010 for full production. But my focus is on the use of this performance indicator. Judgment based on currency depreciation for first year of every government.

This can't be right or is it?

8393 2018-07-03 07:25:27 Just last week i heard there is a certain political party that wanted the parliament to debate the recent increases of oil prices. I almost fall from my chair. Indirect Levies make up 38 % of price at pumps with annual increament. How on earth will the debate influce the price?

8399 2018-07-03 07:24:05 So China starts buying masive amounts of oil from Iran at knock down prices to offset Trumps tarrifs and Trumps plan is to make Saudis pay for it in increased production ! Lol and the price keeps going up regardless, nice one Donnie. #realDonaldTrump
8400 2018-07-03 07:24:05 Zero and oil should not be factored in as GDP contributor. It should be managed separately as a different entity.  Any oil funds used from oil account entity should be treated as borrowed funds and should be paid back to the oil fund. Risky money. Oil on the ground, Turkana fight

8413 2018-07-03 07:21:48 Really? I wondered if that’s what you meant by warmed! Sprinkle with salt and oil? Very hot oven or not? Am I expecting it to wilt or crisp?
8414 2018-07-03 07:21:26 I think the exploding batteries and fact that they don’t actually hover might have something to do with it, but what do I know? I’m just a not bear.

8423 2018-07-03 07:19:43 This is basic economics bru the forces of supply &demand determine the price equilibrium, OPEC decisions can somehow affect the price of oil by altering expectations. PetroSA is actually playing a big role in exploring other natural gases but in fuel specific we are very limited
8424 2018-07-03 07:19:43 Shale oil had also very bad hit in 2015-2016 due to low prices and most of the the shale companies were sold to mutual funds, who love to see oil prices skyrocketing again and would avoid further investment, I think

8443 2018-07-03 07:16:26 You are aware that PetroSA has limited reserves? Currently they supply a lousy 5% of the nations fuel requirements. We have 7 oil majors in SA. Who are far established. We all rely on imports we do not have the resources.

8446 2018-07-03 07:16:19 As you are well aware, Most of the major oil players shifted their investment into other alternatives thinking that oil future is nearing its term. Even opec members did not get enough cash to invest in the last 5 years due to huge losses of oil price crashes.

8481 2018-07-03 07:09:19 Pruitt is so slimy & swampy, I won’t be surprised that if/when he is eventually investigated, they discover that among his many offenses, he was also taking bribes & kick back $ from all those gas & oil companies. Yup, you read it here 1st folks.

8530 2018-07-03 07:02:17 Visited them last year. Amazing creatures and the rangers and park staff are doing a fantastic job. Numbers have increased the last few years. Shameful that Oil Drilling is being allowed... absolutely shameful.
8531 2018-07-03 07:02:05 As I have been saying for years....." Oil was discovered under the North Sea off the shores of Scotland and a country inside the M25 got  exceedingly rich ".
8532 2018-07-03 07:02:02 Chilaquiles! We had a great place in Avila Beach. Then they had to dig up the beach and half the town down to like 20 feet and haul it away as got contaminated from oil over many years. Then they rebuilt it like a Disneyified beach town, all pastels, so don't go much.
8533 2018-07-03 07:01:58 Marseille soap rubbed into everyrhing, washed by hand in hot water, rinsed clean then wash off soap with dish washing fluid, then chucked back into the machine. Might work.

8539 2018-07-03 07:01:19  if the price we paying wasn’t rising will there be any discussion? You can’t use cosmetic differences to hide poor analysis. Petrol prices are primarily due to oil prices and the value of the Rand. Due to low productivity, the Rand will always depreciate in the long term

8628 2018-07-03 06:44:53 I am sure. Why would any moral country buy oil from Iran? Really need to ask yourself that.
8629 2018-07-03 06:44:36 I can’t find my Moroccan oil and my curly haired ass just might die.
8630 2018-07-03 06:44:29 Get someone to pour olive oil into your ear while you lie on your side then put cotton balls in your ear so the olive oil doesn't fall out and lie on your side for a few hours and don't take the cotton balls out for at least 6 hours I feel your pain I hope it helps

8650 2018-07-03 06:41:22 The only slightly accurate thing you have in anything you said is that the US has multiple military bases throughout the world. Where are most of those bases? In the Middle East, where terrorists are more powerful than the government. What else is there? Oil.

8663 2018-07-03 06:39:44 Lol
Those unpaid bonds are a libiality of the govt. as those companies are owned by the govt. itself.

And payments are deferred all the time, which is sort of normal considering the record breaking high prices of crude oil.

8883 2018-07-03 05:52:26 Electrical Mobility will also take time to reach the level where it could challenge or provide alternative to oil dependent transportation. It needs policies, manufacturing, infrastructure nd maintainence to roll out smoothly. All this could take approx 10yrs or more

8930 2018-07-03 05:46:19 @CNBCClosingBell @The_IPO They want oil prices to stay high not lower, there's no real cause of oil gas to be  as high as it is now so it's a great investment for investors but companies who use oil should be reviewed on profit margins like transport & materials made from oil.

The question isn’t just about how long oil will last Mr. Eschenbach, it’s also about the present day costs of fossil fuels, which arguably fuels the debate overall.

8971 2018-07-03 05:40:42 Was making a point on how energy itself in the long run is finite. In this case, fossil fuels are much, much more finite than solar would be.

9056 2018-07-03 05:24:48 Indeed I remember the oil shortage. It was a result of a failed attempt to fix the price of oil in the US at a below-market value, with a very predictable result ... what's your point? Me, I wager placing even one egg into a subsidized renewable basket is mondo stupid.

9077 2018-07-03 05:20:41 Do you remember the oil shortages in the 70s? It doesn’t even have to be gone, gone before crisis emerges. Even if the estimate is way off, it is again still matter of time. I wager placing all our eggs into a steadily disappearing basket is unwise environmentally & economically.
9078 2018-07-03 05:20:41 I do. I did. Changed the oil in my car and had dinner at my favorite restaurant. Highly productive day. 
9079 2018-07-03 05:20:34 Well Venezuela is in its current state because there economy depended on the price of oil. When it went down their economy crashed. Then corrupt officials took over so you can’t blame it on socialism.

9112 2018-07-03 05:14:56 Not forgetting our Gov't stole at least R1.5bn, perhaps as much as R2.2bn, from South African taxpayers in 2015 when it dumped its oil reserves at $28 a barrel, at least $10 below the market price ruling at the time exposing us to actually having no oil reserves.
9113 2018-07-03 05:14:54 LOL! The POTUS tried to pretend that there was such a thing as “beautiful, clean coal”, and that it would make a come-back. Both false. Also, he and Rexxon Tillerson are in bed with Big Oil, sooo... nope.

9139 2018-07-03 05:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza for lunch today will be: undercooked crust with greasy coconut oil and mushroom.

9144 2018-07-03 05:10:33 I prefer Frank's Every Sauce Game of the Year Edition, which has all the DLC:

Teriyaki!
Balsamic vinaigrette!
Motor oil!
Polyjuice potion!
Maple syrup!
Gummi berry juice!
An entire can of Surge from the 90s, not the new stuff that tastes different!

9148 2018-07-03 05:09:59 Those countries' governments own a large share of the companies there, particularly oil & energy & they use their ownership as leverage for wage equality & revenue for the country to subsidize their programs, also their personal tax rate is high, while corporate tax rate is lower

9155 2018-07-03 05:08:49 This right here is poor journalism, shows lack of applying one’s mind on the facts. Oil pice is up and EM currencies (Brazil, Turkey, Argentina, Mexico, SA, India etc) are weak. How does corruption get its here. Fuel prices are a direct result of weak Rand and high oil prices.
9156 2018-07-03 05:08:19 Hey guys if you don't use coconut oil on the daily you should rly try it.
9157 2018-07-03 05:08:14 the body shop tea tree face wash made it worse..should I try raw tea tree oil?
9158 2018-07-03 05:07:35 Pickled herring despite having a good enough economy to afford edible food, a massively violent past with no traces of it in the modern day, and a democratic socialist state based on oil money. Norway knows how to do "inconsistent" right, I'll give them that

9160 2018-07-03 05:07:32 spread oil around with paper towel leave on stovetop until next use if i don't have an animal fat i will use grapeseed oil (no real reason) i've banned all corn and soybean oil because bad luck or something like that
9161 2018-07-03 05:07:28 Let me find out CBD oil works wonders for menstrual cramps. Enhance my life. 
9162 2018-07-03 05:07:24 I personally like to get drenched in truffle oil before going out on a Saturday night.
9163 2018-07-03 05:07:09 It's a painful thought but I understand the government is not to blame it's price of brand-crude oil. Car pooling, planned trips, less consumption by tyre management & maintenance etc.
9164 2018-07-03 05:07:08 I expect knights and Avs to be worse next season and maybe even the sharks to some extent. Also can't rule out the Blackhawks. Saad Crawford and Keith rebounding will certainly make things interesting

9170 2018-07-03 05:05:53 @charliekirk11 should debate @billmaher 
Bill still pushes the “Russian collusion” hoax as he’s too ignorant to see reality
Trump is building our military & oil production, both are bad for Russia
Trump pulled out of the Iran Deal, which Putin & Obama loved
I could outdebate Bill
9171 2018-07-03 05:05:38 Awesome America is an oil exporter, this is so important in so many way not to mention foreign policy....Sorry you whine about a VERY good thing!

9173 2018-07-03 05:05:23 I was cooking and some hot oil popped up all over my hand. It’s been 2 hours. I’m ready to amputate, it’s just my left hand 
9174 2018-07-03 05:05:08 In some of your fb lives and podcasts you mention needing to relax or escape from your sessions , you should think about CBD oil!

9180 2018-07-03 05:04:19 Many ideas & technology are good enough today, but they can't get any scale or traction because they aren't subsidized and encouraged the way oil corporations are.  Also, many trade agreements are written in such a way that clean tech can't disrupt markets w/o legal consequences.

9182 2018-07-03 05:03:59 Big countries with oil have fallen, look at Libya, Turkana can't be exempted.... Wait for the worse...
9183 2018-07-03 05:03:36 @mulaney I asked my sister how people would contact oil companies when they struck oil in the old days and she said to ask you do you know
9184 2018-07-03 05:03:20 Well, new money isn’t money though. TX is a prime example (sorry for the pun, but it works so well for our two best has-been industries). I think cattle money ripened by the 1960’s, but oil money wasn’t money until they canceled Dallas.
9185 2018-07-03 05:03:17 wasted $40 on some fucking oil for this bitch ass pen just for it not to work just so i could try to figure it out just so i could get frustrated and most likely break the fucking thing. im sticking to rolling and packing

9187 2018-07-03 05:03:08 I’m most likely gonna say this on another platform of social media but I’m tweeting it so I don’t forget

At the beginning of the year, I found that my edge on my left side receded a lil. I put Castor oil on that area like weekly, and the patch is growing back.
9188 2018-07-03 05:02:58 My point is that at least Tesla is doing something where as all the others are still dependant on big oil. Also plastic is bad for the environment but people still use it. . We have tripled the amount of co2 and if everyone were to switch we would all make an impact

9215 2018-07-03 04:58:50 What's Putin's sin? He dispatched the Zionist [EU] Banking & Finance Mafia who it so happens own The US Federal Reserve Bank, ending 50 yrs of their plundering the Russian economy & Russia's Oil industry. They have been after him ever since. LEARN! Who owns the Fed owns America!
9216 2018-07-03 04:58:17 Whatever sins we’ve committed are cancelled out by the fact that you guys elected a manifestly unqualified, compromised, racist, wannabe fascist, orange snake oil salesman to the the President of these United States.

9223 2018-07-03 04:57:16 Did you think for one moment the Conservative government would get AB oil to tidewater, their obsession and goal? In their ten years, they didn't.
9224 2018-07-03 04:57:01 @DJFreshSA Please ask him why we don't use locally produced petrol from Sasol at a locally determined price versus this international nonsense? We don't even need to care what's happening with the oil or exchange rate. #FreshBreakfast

9235 2018-07-03 04:54:03 Trader Joe's wild salmon was dinner tonight: sautéed in olive oil and capers, sprinkled with rock salt, fresh ground pepper, and an Israeli spice I bought in Tel Aviv long long long ago. Five stars, especially the crispy salmon skin.

9264 2018-07-03 04:46:47 Everyone in  administration does the opposite of what they’re supposed to do. Housing guy raises rents, Environmental guy kowtows to corporate polluters, Consumer protection guy coddles the bank$, Interior guy allows oil drilling in national parks. Typical.
9265 2018-07-03 04:46:38 Funny how something we celebrate is a war we create for oil and to tell the kids we are fighting for freedom, but its just money, and then we constantly say to support the troops but if we supported them they wouldnt have these problems #PTSD #supportthetroops

9283 2018-07-03 04:43:27 This Administration does recognize the poverty and is successfully bringing about more jobs. The tens of millions who are out of jobs can thank the Obama Administration in large part for the crippling regulations and by shutting down the coal companies and oil drilling.
9284 2018-07-03 04:43:24 I swear by it. Been taking for 3+ months to reduce my anxiety and sleep better. It’s been great so far. Anxiety is down and sleeping like a baby. Have you tried CBD oil before?
9285 2018-07-03 04:43:21 This is HILARIOUS esp when guys like @StevenArmstrong minions charge my Gramdmother 3k for a blown motor because she couldn't produce ONE oil change slip. She had them all but ONE. 3k, thanks for buying Ford your entire life!!
9286 2018-07-03 04:43:16 Yeahh he hasnt been doing edibles but he’s doing oil now 
9287 2018-07-03 04:43:03 Heaven is when you use an ice cold jade roller and use it to apply facial oil
9288 2018-07-03 04:42:48 I farm here. I've bought out 2/3 of my family because aunt n uncle r recently deceased and everyone expects a big payout w/o work. It's tough as shit. I've sold every little outlying piece to keep the "main" farm intact. If it wasn't for oil&gas interests, there'd be nobody.
9289 2018-07-03 04:42:19 Factors that may need to be considered in the price of fuel include the oil price, exchange rates, refiner’s margins, site volumes and product supply and demand. Additionally, fuel prices can and do fluctuate and there are times when you may see variances. 2/3

9294 2018-07-03 04:41:35 My grandma asked Rd where has he been & he said “I was changing the oil in my car”

This guy has been gone since yesterday afternoon 
9295 2018-07-03 04:40:46 Bones don’t turn to oil 
9296 2018-07-03 04:40:31 Ok, no judgement but how do women with long hair get out of their house with crap loads of oil in her hair and then, not even tie it to disgust others
P.S It smells bad too.
9297 2018-07-03 04:40:31 My dog has mast cell cancer and hip dysphasia. We thought he was nearing his last days as we had to carry a 75# dog outside. Put him on CBD oil for pain. He is like a puppy again. Has personality back and walking around like a champ! Good luck

9302 2018-07-03 04:39:55 Because electric energy is hardly a major use for oil and gas. Transportation and manufacturing are much more reliant on Petroleum. So unless you want to walk everywhere and not have a new iPhone, you’ll still need oil. World demand is still increasing.
9303 2018-07-03 04:39:52 ？　グレショは現実ですよね！
9304 2018-07-03 04:39:45 Oil and gas are expensive, pipelines are very cheap (over their lifetime).
9305 2018-07-03 04:39:17 There are biodegradable straws. In the end, oil will run out and there will be no more plastic anyway. Best to look for an alternative now.
9306 2018-07-03 04:39:11 Life tip: rub your phone with toner too bc you said really put all that oil n dirt on ya face.
9307 2018-07-03 04:38:37 Again, there is nothing new in this. We have been importing the crude oil since ages. Is crude oil is the costliest now? no, it is not. Is rupee is lowest now, Yes, it is all time low. You can't justify it with only the rise in crude oil prices.
9308 2018-07-03 04:38:37 Don't Alaskans also receive monthly oil royalties?

9310 2018-07-03 04:38:05 Just made this from scratch.  Angel Hair pasta with butter, olive oil, sea salt, garlic salt, red pepper, black pepper, tin of button mushrooms, slices of Brie and topped off with Parmesan.  Genius.
9311 2018-07-03 04:37:45 You're most probably right: the next big war will be over water, not oil. Agriculture alone will require more than US has, 10-20 years from now. Also gotta keep those golfs green, in the desert. Importing icebergs won't cut it.
9312 2018-07-03 04:36:23 I hate these oil pipelines that are going on.
9313 2018-07-03 04:36:14 hasn't QC developed a lot of its hydro power (e.g. La Grande IV)? i thought it was being criticized for not developed its shale oil resources; eg on Anticosti Island?!
9314 2018-07-03 04:36:07 You be making noise on OTT but the fuel has gone up by shs100. Ohh and before I forget, rolex prices will soon go up as there is a new tax on cooking oil. #Uganda @gmkatamba @msikhu @GabrielIguma
9315 2018-07-03 04:35:55 Forget about this world-it truly is passing away. If u want peace & contentment check out Jesus. Not breezing thru a church clueless but engage with a Paster or clergy. No one can sell u snake oil & religion doesn’t kill brain cells. Treat your soul to an eternity w/God.

9323 2018-07-03 04:34:55 Dhruvil, you must be aware about the crude oil prices in 14 compare to now. Then BJP people made it political agenda and shamed the then government. And why India is agreed to reduce the import from Iran on the guidance of USA? China didn't follow the command of USA.
9324 2018-07-03 04:34:45 Here we go again! Libya declared force majeure on Tuesday as crude oil prices are about to stall. It's starting to look suspicious, though!! Be aware, trading volume will be light during the 4th of July holiday!!
9325 2018-07-03 04:34:35 Omg, I loaded the broadcast and randomly started it at the 12 minute mark. If you're so worried about this civil war, why are you pushing your snake oil in a "Second Revolution" sale? What a pos...how's your ex?
9326 2018-07-03 04:34:30 We have got to address the issue of state capture:those whobankrolled the campaigns are running down the country!the sugar, maize and oil barons,parties must state in advance  those who sponsored  their campaigns otherwise we will be moving round the circle @KobwangaRoy @OAmollo
9327 2018-07-03 04:34:25 Read that spiders don’t like peppermint oil so I doused my room in it and just now realizing it was overkill and I can barely breathe and my eyes are watering but there are no spiders so far so it’s working

Hopefully things can stabilise on the oil front

9345 2018-07-03 04:30:09 Leafy greens are great at making sure you have general nutrients but they bloat like crazy (when I had to be in a leo for ballet daily, kale was an impossible option) but wow you’ll defff be in ketosis. Ik it’s calorie dense, but try some avocado w eggs instead of olive oil?
9346 2018-07-03 04:30:03 @realDonaldTrump What on God’s earth have you been smoking? I have not heard a single person say that they are concerned, much less upset about a discussion of eliminating ICE. Are you hearing voices again. Like the Saudi’s agreeing to increase oil production? You need help soon.
9347 2018-07-03 04:29:49 Canadian oil companies on the large side are generally American owned. That said, they have made money with us all along. Tariffs only hurt them there.
9348 2018-07-03 04:29:42 I think some people with persistent pain may see cannabis oil as the next wonder drug, when simple basic stretching & exercises, pacing etc will be more useful.

9355 2018-07-03 04:28:33 Neil. The point is simply that GP are hypocrites and are NOT protesting for environmental purposes. This feed isnt saying no foreign oil to the East - just calling out GP lack of action in other regions.

9362 2018-07-03 04:27:05 Is this the classic “Red Oil” since St John’s Wort Flowers turn the oil red? Been a couple years since I had made a batch of the old Red Oil.
9363 2018-07-03 04:27:05 Moisturize your dick, it's a piece of skin that gets neglected from moisturizer. I recommend coconut oil. Let it breathe every couple of days, elongated heat to your balls leads to problems. Trim and shape. Dont do anything with anyone that would send you to jail with it( rape).

9379 2018-07-03 04:24:26 It's just like how they won't stop suggesting the medication/treatment/gadget they read about, confident that you haven't already looked into it.

I can barely tweet about chronic pain without some dipshit telling me about cannabis oil
9380 2018-07-03 04:24:21 Semua boleh. Dia ada bg manual jugak, sbb lain makanan lain masa & suhu yg sesuai. Mimi suka masak ayam, juicy je. Ikan goreng pun boleh, tp takkan crispy mcm kita goreng dlm minyak. Tp healthy la. Sbb tak guna minyak bnyk, just drizzle olive oil je.

9419 2018-07-03 04:19:04 You can also visually inspect your alternator from the outside, if its extremely dirty or oil has gotten into it it might be dead for sure. Other thing, if your battery light is on in the dashboard then it's already telling you that there's a charging system fault.

9474 2018-07-03 04:09:45 Trump can't control the price of oil. There are legitimate supply constraints. Big money is buying forward time spreads at elevated prices on WTI. I wouldn't want to get in front of this freight train.

9530 2018-07-03 04:02:33 He's being shunned because he's thrown a goddamn connecting rod, has a cracked engine block, and is leaking oil and antifreeze all over the highway. Talking to him these days is about as fun as talking to your drunk Aunt Helen about her sex toys.
9531 2018-07-03 04:02:33 So, a pot-loving author (whose name I won't mention) claims that Jesus used cannabis oil to perform miracles. But of course! Pot can open blind eyes, unstop deaf ears, cause cripples to walk, and raise people from the dead. How did we miss this?

9534 2018-07-03 04:02:09 . it's a democracy in which the electorate determines how oil companies should behave and the consumers pay those companies to screw up the environment.   So yes, "the public" should pay for everything - an inducement to make better decisions.

9553 2018-07-03 03:59:19 it was free and i had already tasted olive oil ice cream so i honestly felt like i had nothing to lose. spoiler alert: i lost everything that i thought i had
9554 2018-07-03 03:58:50 I live for peppermint essential oil
9555 2018-07-03 03:58:49 I think a lot about how if public infrastructure got half the attention and funding as scooters we'd be driving on roads built without tar and oil that allowed rain water to flow without flooding and never cracked or buckled.

9558 2018-07-03 03:58:32 “Wing oil.”

He couldn’t help but deflate a little.

“No one teaches me these things.”

His wings showed off his anger just for a second, then went back to how they were. 

“Why?”
9559 2018-07-03 03:58:26 Serious question Katherine. I work a few hundred km downwind of the oil sands.  Massive CO2 emissions. Yet no effect on temperature compared to low CO2 atmospheric conditions. Still -40 C in the winter, + 25 C summer. Why does no one use  this for empirical testing, experiments?
9560 2018-07-03 03:58:25 @CBCAfterdark I live in oil industrial city Jubail, Saudi Arabia...teaching drama out there when not in Manchester, UK. I’m a songwriter from Edmonton. Home for a few weeks. Driving back to my parents’ acreage shortly. Nimbin was amazing by Mappe. Always love @imogenheap x

9562 2018-07-03 03:58:01 Same problems in junior carried over into pro career; inconsistency, allowing pucks to go through him. There were two games that summed up his career with #Oilers to kind of book end each side. Game against SJ a few years ago, and the Game against CGY last year..

9565 2018-07-03 03:57:20 ... As opposed to the skullfuckedly insane and exponentially bigger taxpayer subsidies we pay for deadly car monoculture via basically free parking, street maintenance under needlessly heavy vehicles, first responder time to deal with crashes, wars to protect oil dictators ...
9566 2018-07-03 03:57:14 Spiders hate peppermint oil. Put some in a squirt bottle + water and spray your garage and all door frames.
9567 2018-07-03 03:57:06 US and Britain still support groups Allied to Isis for their little oil game. 

You guys need a better flag. Nothing uglier than the Stars and Stripes given what it stands for today.

9572 2018-07-03 03:55:59 @theresa_may What? A British oil company is looking to be involved in the destruction of one of the last remaining diverse habitats on the planet?! Disgusting! Stop this now!!!
9573 2018-07-03 03:55:46 De Chavez decian, que había que esperar, y miren. Venezuela el primer exportador de personas. Ellos se quedaron con el petroleo, los dolares, con todo. Si México no se le pone duro. Van a ser otra Venezuela. Ellos tienen materias primas, mano de obra barata, tecnificación y oil
9574 2018-07-03 03:55:32 I will never compare being a delivery driver to being a server bc I get paid minimum to fold boxes sometimes while these young girls would literally change your oil and give you a back rub so they can make that extra $5-6 dollars a table. Y’all better tip your wait staff
9575 2018-07-03 03:55:29 Oh no that is absolutely terrible! I recommend olive oil. #ItalianCureAll
9576 2018-07-03 03:55:19 Juan Cole says Saudi Arabia cant increase oil production fast enough to save gas prices in America, even as Trump is trying to get that country to.
9577 2018-07-03 03:55:19 bio oil works amazing
9578 2018-07-03 03:55:13 Do as she say....but u dont need the oil. GOD bless and I pray hes found safe
9579 2018-07-03 03:55:12 "Yeah. You can use a soft brush, but I personally use my fingers, like this."

He gently carded his fingers through your feathers, making sure he wasn't pulling something he shouldn't.

"This way, you get the free feathers out and you're spreading your wing oil. Which is good."

9583 2018-07-03 03:54:43 The better news
Iran will be only an oil buyer in the near feauture.
Iran's economic policy will surrender the West. When oil prices are rising day by day, Iran will sell its oil for only a few years, subtly and Unattractive
Never can all roads be closed.
9584 2018-07-03 03:54:41 “Thank you for this,” I type as I loop “the oil slick” (which is a high compliment)
9585 2018-07-03 03:54:36 But Literally all my oil carriages are gone rip ME I WILL probably not be sleeping tonight. Tomorrow...i get paid I live
9586 2018-07-03 03:54:23 And therein lies everything that is wrong. “Every American has the right to”. Oil/renewables. Guns/no guns. Healthcare/insurance. Too much profit with the way things are. People at the top intebd to keep it this way.

9592 2018-07-03 03:53:57 Even though fireworks are illegal where I live, people have started celebrating already. Just applied some Lavender Essential Oil on my dogs to try and keep them calm. #poorpups #furrybabies #fireworks
9593 2018-07-03 03:53:57 Tomorrow will be interesting in Parliament. Withholding comment until all has been concluded and sufficient information surfaces. In the interim - globally, oil lends itself to all manner of misbehavior (I use the term loosely) that has to be arrested. No pun intended.

9596 2018-07-03 03:53:51 I am afraid they are both really sharp, and they have a plan and a huge bankroll.  obammy is a premier snake oil salesman in my opinion.
9597 2018-07-03 03:53:18 My head hurts so bad I sprinkled peppermint oil on my work shirt.
9598 2018-07-03 03:53:14 Sweaaaarrrr???  lmao She didn’t sprinkle you with holy oil?
9599 2018-07-03 03:53:01 I thought that coconut oil can throw off your pH balance?
9600 2018-07-03 03:52:58 Only one worth keeping, they still hold his rights. I do chuckle though at the masses who not too long ago were so excited about Brossoit.

9602 2018-07-03 03:52:51 nyquist and anthansou for futures . nyquist with ld and anthansou with mc'd (fastest line in nhl) would work wonders for the oil . gotta be d's or c's coming back . plus kassian because wings need a cop.helms wheels could be added to the deal too. could be good trading partners
9603 2018-07-03 03:52:32 I spilled oil on myself the other day while cooking and that shit hurted, left a scar too...and it got me thinking about how many times my momma probably burned herself cooking for my family and I. Thanks momma for all you’ve done and I’m sorry if we ever complained

9606 2018-07-03 03:52:14 Greater Houston real estate market will approx. go up another 12% if the oil prices keep climbing this way.
9607 2018-07-03 03:52:11 Huh, that wouldn't be much change for the latino's living there, R govt has pretty much cut all funding that benefits working people...but if the state lost US military bases, university funding, and oil & gas company welfare, the white people there would starve to death
9608 2018-07-03 03:52:10 I cook my chicken with the chicken skin in olive oil
9609 2018-07-03 03:52:02 I’ve been putting castor oil on my lashes since April & they’ve grown so much 
9610 2018-07-03 03:52:00 Bigger question is why Putin told Trump to do this?  Putin will likely be selling oil, gas etc. to NK.  Plus he cements another crazy dictator who will point nukes at us and our allies just like Russia is doing ... and Trump probably got a big loan "forgiven".  Hmmm

9612 2018-07-03 03:51:45 Lavender oil.
9613 2018-07-03 03:51:30 None of that has anything to do with collusion. Paul Manafort got picked up for supporting a pro Russian candidate, because the CIA was backing the opposing pro American candidate. Let that sink in. The US was interfering with the political affairs Ukraine to sell oil.
9614 2018-07-03 03:51:29 I use coconut oil for my skin and hair and I’m not ashamed

9617 2018-07-03 03:50:09 Electric probably would be unaffected. So many pros and so few cons...I wonder why we still use dies...oh...oh yeah, that's right.  The oil companies own the government.

9634 2018-07-03 03:48:19 This administration, so short sighted, they would eliminate the department that researches renewable engery. Let's all give a big shout out to the corperate oil barons, and other corperate big boys who suck up our public resources for themselves.

9637 2018-07-03 03:48:10 Got asked to deliver some stuff to an oil refinery in Louisiana this morning but they said whoever does it has to be clean shaven for safety reasons. Shoulda told 'em to give me minute and I'll be clean shaven. I have a beard and mustache out of laziness. No sentimental value.
9638 2018-07-03 03:48:06 Piont to ponder , Sir...why , after more than 70 yrs of independence , we still have to look up to sky for blessings ..we havent built adequate irrigation systems . River linking seems a non starter .  Same goes for crude oil situation...80% imports .
9639 2018-07-03 03:47:59 "An emerging slowdown in demand"? Wait, it cannot be. #Oil demand was strong, wasn't it? Not price-related or anything? Oh, well, hello, reality.
9640 2018-07-03 03:47:46 They are fried in rice oil!
9641 2018-07-03 03:47:26 I have a funny story -bout that. My dad was running oil wells in the Libyan desert and asked his southern guy to order some pliers. Didn't come. Dad finally said dammit, where's the pliers? Guy pulled out the order form and said See- they're on the sheet. Dad reads...PLOWERS
9642 2018-07-03 03:47:15 And I hope Venezuela gets better with their piece of shit president taking advantage of their ppl .just trying get rich them self’s for their oil but don’t give af about their ppl smh

9648 2018-07-03 03:46:30 Try using coconut oil as lube!! I have a jar in my nightstand specifically for that purpose!! 
9649 2018-07-03 03:46:18 LOL sounds like a song. At the mo, disappointed that MSM & media does not vet neither Bernie nor his policies as they should - - especially if media parrots him leading the Dem party (which he doesn't, they're drinking snake oil no doubt). They must want Trump another 4 yrs.
9650 2018-07-03 03:46:13 The gyrations are becoming more pronounced each day  that TA/FA no longer have any meaning.  The level of manipulation is so blatant and egregious by state actors it’s causing oil up, PM down, EM currency’s chaos.  It’s unsustainable and dangerous.
9651 2018-07-03 03:46:02 Money is the root of evil 100%. This sucks so much. I want to break their oil sucking machines.. fuck your nutella too.

9674 2018-07-03 03:42:46 How about the LNP & LABOR not sell us out to big oil? The petrol companies do it bc they know they can get away with it. In Sydney the average price is 10c lower. 1.45.5c per litre. There’s your proof our politicians don’t care about us.

9678 2018-07-03 03:41:32 Back in the #oil game again. There may be short term price declines as barrels per day increase, but hard to believe that in the medium term there won’t be upward price shocks as we start to function with less spare capacity. #wti; #brent
9679 2018-07-03 03:41:31 You'd think Dinky Donnie would be embarrassed that Saudi Arabia contradicted his Tweet saying the kingdom will increase oil production, "maybe up to 2,000,000 barrels." @realDonaldTrump lies and it's no longer an issue to some. Typical of the corrupt #Republicans.

9688 2018-07-03 03:39:55 Ugh. I second the clove oil (I’ve never had a toothache but my husband frequently gets them and that stuff seems to help). Sending good July juju (August too, and so on)
9689 2018-07-03 03:39:55 @CafeBernardoPRG do your @Golden1Center garlic fries contain peanut or peanut oil? At my seats, save me a trip back please..
9690 2018-07-03 03:39:47 Mayonnaise with sugar and paprika. It’s fucking disgusting. And who knows what kind of “oil” they put in that garbage. This shit should be banned.
9691 2018-07-03 03:39:39 I remember officers firing the mess cook ‘Yeh omelet kya diesel oil mein banaya??’ when there was too much oil floating around.. The dhaba chicken, sinful to Sandip, looks pretty lethal!! ....Btw, am not a great fan of Dilli’s famous butter chicken either!!
9692 2018-07-03 03:39:38 Amazon is too easy. This oil is too special. I guess when I move back I will have to make a personal appearance!!
9693 2018-07-03 03:39:37 1 Benjamin Netanyahu directly speaks to people of Iran very respectfully on Football, Water 

2 Nikki run to India & make 3 key statements & warn Pak

3 Trump ask Saudi to Increase Oil production to meet the shortage

These are not isolated events. They R connected

Wait & Watch
9694 2018-07-03 03:39:32 I always figured the oil change was a loss leader: it's $47 at the dealer, but he'll wash and vacuum the car.  And I always need something else done, anyway.
9695 2018-07-03 03:39:31 Pigeons are clever. Once a street pigeon in need approached me for help, & I did. She(he?) was covered with sticky gooey oil, & let me pick her up. She spent 2 nights here, then went to NE Wildlife ctr, recovered, & I believe she comes here to eat now. I mean, why not.
9696 2018-07-03 03:39:30 and to not put baby oil

9698 2018-07-03 03:39:20 I mean like which brand of organic coconut oil is the best to use?
9699 2018-07-03 03:39:19 Which set I in? Oil or water? Or air?

9701 2018-07-03 03:39:05 So basically, oil= human development.. and transportation. We do too much!!!? Can’t we just live a simple life!!? All together let’s just decide to stop being so extra plz
9702 2018-07-03 03:38:51 studies confirm that that once the Donald has a toddler tantrum, a #GOP member secretly writes a song about #love
9703 2018-07-03 03:38:47 lol! It's simple. I saute fresh garlic and onions in olive oil, add some washed/chopped kale (I use red or green organic), usually some shitake mushrooms, green beans and, sometimes eggplant. Splash in some wine (port, marsala or a nice red) & some seasoning. #BlerdDating
9704 2018-07-03 03:38:44 Morning our Alan..Just waking up in Mauritus. 
So we arrived yesterday and we are sitting at a fabulous restaurant on the beach. So my weee one (so your a sweaty sock!) said.."mum! Why's Alan got a picture of Barney?".. You  really did make me laugh..

9706 2018-07-03 03:38:32 This dude has been working hard to pull people together. #walkaway is getting bigger and bigger. Dems are snake oil salesmen. Always have been. Not saying the right is perfect but, I think Trump is exposing a lot of people for their real intentions.
9707 2018-07-03 03:38:08 Plastics and other oil based products have improved life expectancy. Cheap gas helps the poor most. How do you suggest we help the poor more than making their lives less expensive?
9708 2018-07-03 03:38:08 If the @EdmontonOilers sign Voynov I will no longer be a fan, I’ve bled oil since I was born but some things are bigger than winning a game or a trophy

9711 2018-07-03 03:37:46 Don’t forget that most modern synthetics can go 10,000 miles, so long as the filter is up to it. I’ve tested viscosity modifiers and suspension particles up to 15K miles. If you swap to a new filter at 7,500 miles, oil fundamentals are just fine.
9712 2018-07-03 03:37:40 Try coconut oil instead
9713 2018-07-03 03:37:30 Well in the mean time I’m still trying to gidure out how to get your spicy oil. Just sayin. And congratulations.
9714 2018-07-03 03:37:17 Are you guys oil or MJ company?
9715 2018-07-03 03:36:47 America has always been great! Stop buying snake oil from charlatans!

9721 2018-07-03 03:36:03 I’m a United fan so my first job is to tell you to support Man United, we have history; we make our own money unlike the oil rich Arab backed clubs. And we have a few Muslims on the squad, what more do you need?
9722 2018-07-03 03:35:52 every time I put my 5 oil cocktail into my hair including the thick goopy mess that is castor oil it makes me feel like I really do deserve my long ass pretty hair
9723 2018-07-03 03:35:44 Don’t forget your coconut oil and tea tree oil.
9724 2018-07-03 03:35:40 You can hear how hot this oil is
9725 2018-07-03 03:35:38 It's a pipe dream, the tech doesn't exist to replace oil. How would we get fruit and veggies in the winter with clean energy? Even the defice you are tweeting on is oil based, how would clean energy replace it?
9726 2018-07-03 03:35:36 i think the saddest part about going to the fair was wanting fried oreos then finding out they cook it with peanut oil

9734 2018-07-03 03:34:15 No, I don't want to sell it off.  I want spending controlled.  When some corrupt idiot spends money by the government and wastes resources, it does NOT help create value.  It is like burning oil for the fun of it.  I can't think of a worse place to spend money than the gov.

9740 2018-07-03 03:33:27 The lake by the port was the color of battered titanium covered with motor oil.
9741 2018-07-03 03:33:21 You don't just use ATF for the power steering pump? I admire your adherence to the specifications .  Also, ATF looks very much like clean engine oil when there's not enough to appear red. Possibly leaking at the connector to the trans cooling loop in the radiator?

9746 2018-07-03 03:32:00 hi @moore4945 i was watching your videos and i was wondering if you liked the argan oil eco better than the krystal one?
9747 2018-07-03 03:31:30 every ancient athenian was gay. Athena really needed to give them all the olive tree so they could stay fucking constantly but comfy now and that’s why there is so much olive oil in Greece
9748 2018-07-03 03:31:21 Members of Congress, their aides, and other officials. The web may even stretch to cultural icons, etc. Then, there’s the media involvement. Fox, FB, then oil/gas, and other ind’s not touched by tariffs. I think the web is very large.
9749 2018-07-03 03:31:08 I hope that by any means the building of the pipelines will be blocked and that Alberta dirty sand oil will stay in the ground forever.

9751 2018-07-03 03:31:03 And if  push comes to shove, Trump can order oil released from the US 'Stratigic Oil reserves'.
But that's  only in an emergency, those are our strategic back up for emergencies, like a war.
9752 2018-07-03 03:30:51 How do you figure that? Because I went to change the oil on my Jeep or do some other chore in between your obsessive back-chats? You claim not to be butt-hurt, but your tit-for-tat slapbacks border on obsession. Er, what's the brain scientist term for that?

thats all i gotta say
9759 2018-07-03 03:30:04 I do as much as I can. I buy the bare minimum of meat, making sure it’s ethically produced. I walk and take the train instead of driving a car.

Everyone uses oil, but the country I’m in is greener than the US. That’s not even the point. The point is that you said the US...
9760 2018-07-03 03:30:00 How much does the oil contribute to the GDP  ?
9761 2018-07-03 03:29:59 Oil based, dressing based, ranch based, basically any other flavored viscous liquid with more flavor than mayo
9762 2018-07-03 03:29:54 PSA: don’t put coconut oil in your hair, I just did and it turned into greasy mess and it won’t come out

9764 2018-07-03 03:29:29 That isn't socialism. Socialism is Venezuela. Billions in oil and the people don't eat everyday.  It's funny how socialists always try to pretend to be something they aren't when they run for office. Doesn't that say something?

9767 2018-07-03 03:29:11 Then surely you're in favor of Kurds & Arabs having 100% of their water & oil resources that Iran depends on.
9768 2018-07-03 03:28:59 I think sir the issue is not about oil shortage, but about our diplomatic stand which has been bludgeoned under US pressure. During Obama period, Manmohan Singh had denied for any cut.

9781 2018-07-03 03:26:40 I got on Google maps and looked up left a question at the local store (Kibbutz Tirat Tzvi - Factory Store) in  Tirat Zvi if they had any info on the Zion Oil project. It's only a mile West of store. No reply yet, heck It was worth a try 
9782 2018-07-03 03:26:33 Only 24% of Iran's oil revenue is considered by the gov in the annual budget approved by the IR-parliament, and 76% of oil revenue remains unused for dollar-only use in the country's foreign exchange fund.
In fact, Iran's demand for oil is only 24%, which is falling every year.

9787 2018-07-03 03:25:50 In 100 years people will laugh at the absurd inefficiency of oil and wonder how primitive we must have been to rely on it.
9788 2018-07-03 03:25:43 Ur policies are tested when envoronment is against you not when it is in favor. Nehru got poor India and unstable un-united India when it got indepedence from British. MMS faced worst world recession in 2008-2011 imcluding highest crude oil prices..why blame mms and nehru??
9789 2018-07-03 03:25:36 Oil industry should pull out of state, sell no gasoline within state borders.

9791 2018-07-03 03:25:28 Bleh my only question is how the hell did that happen?? I don’t really have anything that would leak oil or grease in my room
9792 2018-07-03 03:25:27 Simple, Oil Companies want to make as much $$$ as they can before the  oil $ changes again.
If it goes up they increase their charge ASAP, especially at the pump.
If it goes down, they hold on to that higher $ as long asa they can.
9793 2018-07-03 03:25:17 Let’s drill them for oil!!!

9797 2018-07-03 03:24:47 Answering a question I get asked a lot.. (CBD oil legal)?  YES!  I confirmed with a Mayor this past weekend. It can be shelved, no city ordinance against CBD full spectrum CBD oil.
9798 2018-07-03 03:24:45 Chilli plants keep on giving! I started with one which cost me $2. It kept re-seeding which resulted in 12 productive plants. Fresh chilli, chilli oil and dried chilli in abundance! Haven't tried spring onions. Any tips or tricks?
9799 2018-07-03 03:24:38 ...screwed up everything.  Obama didn't do any hard work, he just kicked the can down the road, he didn't want to deal with it.  when there was an oil spill in the Carribean Sea.  He only talked on the phone with the CEO of the oil company for 20 minutes.  That is weak & lazy...

9803 2018-07-03 03:23:45 1) remember that it can’t grow over night 

2) don’t shampoo everytime you shower  

3) rinse your hair in cold water everytime after you shower

4) apply an oil or mask treatment 

5) try hair boosting supplements

9810 2018-07-03 03:22:08 Not really no. I like it because it has a high smoke point and it’s a really healthy oil.

9822 2018-07-03 03:20:42 What's even the point of being a Raptor's fan when all the talent's in the West? Like idrk how basketball works but at some point shouldn't there be a salary cap or fair play ruling? Even soccer-oil-money-singings are jaw-dropping at the Warriors and Lakers.

9850 2018-07-03 03:16:35 Stopped going to Mexico for vacations a few years ago due to the 3rd World conditions.  You would think that with the oil reserves they have and the ambitious citizens who all are great people that are hard workers and law abiding, their country would have been an economic power.

9858 2018-07-03 03:15:20 So Mexico will legalize drugs & be like a modern Amsterdam with just a dash of kidnapping, human trafficking, & murder for flair.

9860 2018-07-03 03:14:59 MSM did a wonderful job (sarcasm) of ‘selling us’ on the Iraq War, but never looked back + explained to the country that it was all a big lie, to steal the oil. Because we see ourselves as ‘the good guys’, we aren’t supposed to invade countries to plunder their natural resources.
9861 2018-07-03 03:14:47 Oh, really?! Is that why #AlisoCanyon is still open? Is that why his admin approved 100s of #offshore #oil drilling permit in recent years? Is that why he has NEVER helped low-income folks at south end of Salton Sea? What "faith" is that? cc @DanBacher @350sacramento

9959 2018-07-03 03:01:10 Stay away from those oil cans.

9964 2018-07-03 03:00:26 12時を、オイルがお知らせいたします。昼食にオイルが使われてるか探してみましょう。
9965 2018-07-03 03:00:25 Thanks for the link! It's unbelievable. As is the opening up of #Virunga for oil exploration; how can those in power not understand the need to better conserve and protect their natural habitat for their (and all of us) benefit?! 
9966 2018-07-03 03:00:17 #inrbonds #Investorsareidiots @arjunparthasara Crude oil prices continue to rise,this time libiya cuts production.@ketanver
9967 2018-07-03 03:00:16 Soften dry hair: Heat a half cup olive oil (don’t boil it), apply to your hair. Let it set for 45 minutes, then shampoo and thoroughly rinse
9968 2018-07-03 02:59:58 I be riding in niggas car like "sound like he need some oil"
9969 2018-07-03 02:59:40 So I’m leaking oil on the front driver side of the jeep.  Not a blown shock, oil level and pressure is fine.  I think I hit that dry creek hard enough yesterday to open up a portal to an oil only dimension.
9970 2018-07-03 02:59:38 true, the refinery output has more to do with $/hal gas at the pimps.
The oil production output more to do with the $/bbl of raw oil to be refined.
But  it all works together.
9971 2018-07-03 02:59:25 Can't wait to try the healthy hair argon oil shampoo and conditioner sounds great.
9972 2018-07-03 02:59:21 (1) I didn't reply to you . F - T process was meantioned by me in the onset of discussion to refute your nonsensical "windmills need oil" statement and to demonstrate even the jet fuil issue is solvable in a decarbonized scenario.
9973 2018-07-03 02:59:19 I just want a bomb oil massage
9974 2018-07-03 02:59:01 i’ve heard vaseline and coconut oil work pretty well. you could add those in and call it a day
9975 2018-07-03 02:58:52 It is *quite* delightful! Especially during the summer when everything is in season. It's great to bring to picnics/cookouts. A real crowd pleaser. Just give yourself some time to do all the damn chopping beforehand. (And you can cut back on the olive oil if it's too wet... )
9976 2018-07-03 02:58:40 えっいのさん実在してるんですか？！ってナチュラルに思っちゃうからだめ　この前話したのに
9977 2018-07-03 02:58:39 Everything in my house smells like sesame oil right now oml
9978 2018-07-03 02:58:37 That's what I said..Trump ain't gonna give a care about that orange splotch, OR his oil portrait..
9979 2018-07-03 02:58:31 I've added avocado oil to my list of essential oils. It has a high smoke point and adds a lovely, nutty taste. And I'm not even a fan of avocados in general!
9980 2018-07-03 02:58:12 Caster bean oil.
9981 2018-07-03 02:57:50 I drink water with a pinch of baking soda and salt; do Emergen-C or other electrolytes w/o too much sugar; use pH basic from Enzymedica... use Olbas essential oil and Orega-Resp (similar ingredients); take CoQ10... can you tell that this is one of my most distressing symptoms?
9982 2018-07-03 02:57:23 ですねえ…ゴリゴリの技術者タイプ…！　性的な体力の差はありますけどそれにしたって個人差があるんだからやりたい人ができるようになったらいいのに…　おんださんの以前のせいかつやばすぎてやばい　からだだいじにして…
9983 2018-07-03 02:57:10 Where are the oil & water company engineers? Don’t they pump millions of gallons of water out the ground daily and make billions in profits? Maybe even they can’t help but still would like to know they looked into the possibility.
9984 2018-07-03 02:56:17 I think the most essential oil is olive. 

Second place, coconut. 

Thank you.
9985 2018-07-03 02:56:14 dulu cita2nya mau jadi dokter, belok ke mesin. kerja di oil & gas sector, abis itu balik lagi ke mesin. minggu depan kalo jadi mau ikut workshop di lab parasitologi.
namanya idup mesti muter2 dulu ya kemana2.. but i am more than just happy!
9986 2018-07-03 02:56:01 Apricot seeds.  CBD oil. Keto style diet. And most importantly.... Never ever EVER give in. My best wishes, hopes and prayers are with you.
9987 2018-07-03 02:55:47 Stop using lotion! Use some vitamin C and/or vitamin E oil like a type of serum if you can find it. I know i got mine from TJ Maxx
9988 2018-07-03 02:55:29 Gausah soalnya kan face oil itu moisturizer. Moisturizer kan intinya buat menahan kelembaban kulit dengan memberikan a layer of occlusion sehingga penguapan moisture dari kulit jadi minim. Tapi kalau emang kulitmu kering dan menurutmu masih butuh extra occlusion, silahkan saja
9989 2018-07-03 02:54:59 Venezuela has the highest proven oil reserves in the world, higher than Saudi Arabia.  It should be a very rich nation.
9990 2018-07-03 02:54:47 It's been hot and cold all throughout time, even before the industrial revolution.  It's called climate.  Feel free to stop using any and all forms of oil, electricity, gas.
9991 2018-07-03 02:54:29 Well dirtman we definitely no your a bigot. And I have never been on Gov. assistance. I started fishing at 12yrs old and made good money and now I’m in oil patch and twice what you do taxes but up here we actually get something for our tax money free health and education and you
9992 2018-07-03 02:54:19 Bullsh-- baffling Repug;s brains every time!People have been masturbating since cave man times!Probably B4 that as well!This Snake oil salesman doesn't know WTF he;s even talking about!
9993 2018-07-03 02:53:55 SERIOUSLY THO nuge is probably the smartest boy on the oil boys team??
9994 2018-07-03 02:53:45 You're full of banana oil. And help reinforce the impression of tge Libertarian party as?a debating society.
9995 2018-07-03 02:53:32 pake hair oil gt coba?
9996 2018-07-03 02:53:26 If you want to feel like a fresh clean babies butt, with perfect soft skin, rub coconut oil all over yourself while still in the shower. Blot, don't rub with a towel when you get out, and you will feel like an angel.
9997 2018-07-03 02:53:20 And get 30 bucks petrol
Oil is still going up
Don't worry just stay economical
9998 2018-07-03 02:52:52 check oil light on, any daddies want feet pics ? so i can get this done ? :/
9999 2018-07-03 02:52:46 Wonder who that was with him. Be helpful if it was an oil lobbyist.
10000 2018-07-03 02:52:43 This is a lie and you are a snake oil salesman
