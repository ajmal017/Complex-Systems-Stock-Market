2 2018-04-09 23:58:55 @coincrunchin plz do a deep dive and look into crypto debit card, wire transfers like SWIFT/SEPA. To send INR or receive INR. To buy sell crypto Eg- Cex. Io / Revolut. And pass on info to general people and exchanges so that we can still continue with crypto if no fiat available

4 2018-04-09 23:58:50 The Chinese government likes Crypto currency because it undermines US dollar as a global reserve currency. But Crypto currency also undermines CCP’s authoritarian rule. So the Chinese don’t really know what to to now, they are hedging.

52 2018-04-09 23:54:52 Same as valuing emotions...
53 2018-04-09 23:54:41 The people hired are former executives from Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter. Why are you worried about @jess being proud of the fact that they happen to be female?
54 2018-04-09 23:54:31 A quick and concise review, well done!  May have to hunt down some Qash!
55 2018-04-09 23:54:18 See his other tweets before, he attached youtube link to explain.
56 2018-04-09 23:54:14 Why would the @browns take Allen who is like the 6th best QB any earlier than the 3rd round?
57 2018-04-09 23:53:54 I know how you love to promote crypto-zoology!
58 2018-04-09 23:53:47 He is one LoL
59 2018-04-09 23:53:38 I absolutely believe we are only at the beginning of crypto, and we are all early adopters. However, that prediction depends on new money flowing in. While I am cautiously optimistic it's true, I would never simply HODL and be at the mercy of the market.

66 2018-04-09 23:52:57 Bears look exhausted.
67 2018-04-09 23:52:52 Whatever you want. We know the truth.
68 2018-04-09 23:52:45 We should stop giving a shit about one's gender. A woman in crypto doesn't deserve more respect than a man just because she's a woman. Many people are spoilt and expect privileges for their gender, age,appearance or ethnicity.Not how things work. Deal with it

71 2018-04-09 23:52:18 Crypto is a social and cultural revolution far and beyond than people understand yet.
72 2018-04-09 23:52:05 So how do u sue someone from another country ?
73 2018-04-09 23:51:56 $XVG is like a microcosm of $crypto.
A few good elements, lots of shitty ones.
Blew up, enriched early entrants.
Top-buying community members rage all the way down.
Noobs still shilling it not realizing it's now a tool for the MM to take their money.
Early entrants? Been over it
74 2018-04-09 23:51:55 VC spending is just coming off all time highs last year; but spread over fewer deals; After a year of getting machine gun sprayed with ICO's I can understand the misconception, most couldn't qualify for VC funding IMO;
75 2018-04-09 23:51:50 What do you call being shady - providing tons of free helpful information and TA to the crypto community? The ICO Journal is a complete joke. Look at their posts, it's like crypto gossip girl...
76 2018-04-09 23:51:37 260 words on Crypto Wars (129266 total), a Little Brother novel for adults #dailywords (YA novels are enjoyable by adults and teens alike; adult novels may not be appropriate for all kids)
77 2018-04-09 23:51:28 DYOR man. There is WAY too much to write down. They’re the only coin taking a scientific and academic approach to crypto. Just go watch some YouTube videos of @IOHK_Charles speaking about ADA and you’ll see. It’s going to be huge.

81 2018-04-09 23:50:46 The extent of their knowledge of the market and crypto probably on comes from tweets they read online from "cryptocurrency expert traders"

84 2018-04-09 23:50:15 P.S. not every "crypto" coin has to be "anonymous" or have this incredible level of cryptography.

126 2018-04-09 23:45:29 The problem with crypto right now is too many of the enthusiasts are just hodling hoping the prices go up. For it to go up we actually have to create a demand for it, i.e. demanding retailers accept these coins for payment.

132 2018-04-09 23:44:50 Exactly. It's funny. We are all into crypto to leave all the old shit behind and suddenly get sucked back to court and legal boring stuff. I don't trust anyone ATM. Everyone is taking time. Both firano and nano never really explain what happened or really take this seriously.

157 2018-04-09 23:41:06  never thought of that ww3 scenario but in case it happened.. Crypto will boom because people would like to transfer money from one place to another
158 2018-04-09 23:41:05 100% understand and back you, sirpatec said he did not give you any software but never mentioned that he was on your computer left those details out!!
159 2018-04-09 23:41:02 Lots of top Wallstreet execs leaving to go to the crypto space. I certainly don’t think they would be going into crypto if they weren’t bullish on the future of digital currency.
160 2018-04-09 23:41:00 And are there screenshots anywhere of them lying about BCH's existence before August 1st?
161 2018-04-09 23:41:00 Ohh @crypto_rand...why. If you're thinking tech is going to remain this gender imbalanced, you're going to get your jimmies rustled even more. The blockchain is making things MORE egalitarian, not less. Why do you want to demonize gender parity efforts like this?

177 2018-04-09 23:39:03 5% engagement in Plumbing too, I see no complaints on either side. They have more need for plumbing now and the last N years, than bitcoin/crypto. I speak about crypto and programming to males and females equally. When it gets easy and fully built. Plentt will onboard.

181 2018-04-09 23:38:03 Pinochet was put in power by a coup d'état that assassinated the openly Marxist president.

His coup d'état was supported by the CIA under a Republican president, specifically because he was a capitalist overthrowing a Marxist.

Pinochet was not some "crypto-socialist"
182 2018-04-09 23:38:00 Bingo! Would love to hear what they have on him. Don't get me wrong, I loved watching him take so many people apart with his questioning, but he really is all bark, no bite.

198 2018-04-09 23:36:28 As for low-tech-friendliness, Salsa20 can be implemented on low-power Atmel or STM32 microcontrollers anyway. Cells can build their own crypto devices relatively cheaply.

211 2018-04-09 23:35:03 No matter your stance on crypto: bottom line is the current “currencies” are making people feel miserable due to anxiety on both sides of the fence. B/c of that and many other reasons I’m not a fan of BTC, but remain optimistic towards psychologically fair crypto in the future.
212 2018-04-09 23:34:55 “White men need not apply”...basically
213 2018-04-09 23:34:49 new follower here--thanks for sharing. I'm only learning TA now but I can see from your history that you've been pretty on-point. And I should add that your analysis is refreshing among the crypto-maximalists that use terms like hodl and bullish in every other post

231 2018-04-09 23:31:35 wonder if btc dominance peaked at 45.37% of total crypto market cap on April 1? starting to slowly retreat. now down to 44.3%. that would be good news for alt coins. they tend to spike when btc dominance goes down.

269 2018-04-09 23:28:41 What we have in Europe in general is labeled 'Democracy' but doesn't necessarily qualifies as democracy. The superior efficiency of private companies is not automatically so, either. The UK railway privatization led to catastrophic accidents. Repairs are paid with tax money.

286 2018-04-09 23:26:14 Wtf kinda bullshit job is that. Do they go around giving out hugs and stickers?
287 2018-04-09 23:26:01 Who knew something called 'crypto' would be shady as fuck
288 2018-04-09 23:25:59 I am pretty sure you are wrong here, why would twitter be any different? I see a lot of mansplaining in this thread. Of course gender is still a thing. Even though i dont agree with them highlighting it i still believe the reaction here to it is so exaggerated
289 2018-04-09 23:25:49 Excellent work team! Win win for all of us! Long live crypto!
290 2018-04-09 23:25:48 I cut my dick off last week. I am now gender neutral. My strategy worked though. I am drowning in job offers.
291 2018-04-09 23:25:43 But more babies are dying!
292 2018-04-09 23:25:27 max lev all in short on the books, let's get it
293 2018-04-09 23:25:25 I assume it should be added in the coming days, but we never got a response from them because I think they are backed up.
294 2018-04-09 23:25:06 I really want to figure out how to introduce a crypto-fear hybrid based currency that would make Kublai Khan proud.
295 2018-04-09 23:25:03 Still buying lmao  R.I.P 
I’ll say a prayer for you tonight. 
And by prayer, I mean I will smoke a blunt and laugh at you.
296 2018-04-09 23:24:59 Or just buy some $XRP for the same feeling.
297 2018-04-09 23:24:51 Yes, but in the end for states is imposible to account that trades unless you made them in fiat exchanges they can force. So is useless.
298 2018-04-09 23:24:48 The U.K. and US, MASSIVELY underproduced the number of people we need in technological fields. Devs are going to be very scarce soon. 50/50 would mean maximum technological progress.
299 2018-04-09 23:24:46 @MSX4gOTP2Pmq15L I READ & POST ABOUT CRYPTO DAILY. #CRYPTOCURRENCIES

304 2018-04-09 23:24:03 @NipseyHussle ready to double up on a crypto bag? Large profit margin on the long shots!
305 2018-04-09 23:24:00 Bought in December and lowered my average by buying and buying as well as daytrading.  No plans to sell anytime soon.
306 2018-04-09 23:23:57 Feeling the need to stock up on all the main players in #crypto before all hell breaks loose.. Bullish sentiment is palpable.. Wishful thinking?
307 2018-04-09 23:23:52 And again, @notsofast makes some great points. There is no denying that something like a Sybil attack could happen. But as of right now, the proposals have been legit and carried out successfully. The amount of progress that is happening is great to see.
308 2018-04-09 23:23:51 Really? He's into Crypto? Last I had heard he was down in Georgia playing for a Fiddle made of Gold...
309 2018-04-09 23:23:49 link please?
310 2018-04-09 23:23:20 Good word. It's overwhelming and high anxiety starting out, I bet that's why a lot don't follow through. Easy to dream and run numbers for profit potential, hard to get your hands dirty.
311 2018-04-09 23:23:01 good call by Tone... but it must bounce somewhere first.... never straight down
312 2018-04-09 23:22:35 Crypto Twitter is exhausting. A lot of real shitheads running amok. I’m logging off for a bit.
313 2018-04-09 23:22:33 Market cap is down like 40% from The Glory Days of December.
314 2018-04-09 23:22:30 Be a ‘bread winner’ and make a ‘heartless decision’ these coincide.  you noobs getting smashed on delayed market sentiment

322 2018-04-09 23:21:47 Also what counts as joining? I've been holding crypto since 2016 but I didn't start trading until the Great Bull Run of 2017
323 2018-04-09 23:21:46 Sort of insulting to women to now have to wonder if they were hired based on competency and abilities or if it was to fulfill a companies gender quota
324 2018-04-09 23:21:40 Unfortunately that’s the way the world is you get people who will take advantage of the people when people feel the can multiply there money of the back of it, but crypto is unpredictable so don’t know why people follow advice when it’s unpredictable
325 2018-04-09 23:21:16 Remember when you take that poll try to remember it’s economics there are no one vote per person. This should be obviously by every publicly traded company in the world. Only saying this to separate popularity with from real votes.
326 2018-04-09 23:21:09 @CFTC @giancarloCFTC May I ask for your opinion about the current situation which might seem that the incomplete regulation drives traders from crypto spot market to futures markets, drying out the spot volume and generating unnecessary price fluctuation?
327 2018-04-09 23:21:01 Yes

340 2018-04-09 23:19:29 Some Crypto Jews make a point to tell their children their ancestors were Jews at age 12. Most are more Catholic than the pope, out of fear handed down & reinforced over centuries.

342 2018-04-09 23:19:21 Lol its not re-branding... wayyy bigger than just a rebrand. 
343 2018-04-09 23:19:02 I mean, all the stated rewards have happened. I haven't had an instance where the rewards were off.
344 2018-04-09 23:19:00 Bitcoin dropped like 5% this morning, it's not volatile anymore?
345 2018-04-09 23:18:58 Under represented?? What's the right %?? Are you serious?? We all know that they are usually smarter than men, probably they just prefer to do something else.

348 2018-04-09 23:18:16 No man, some r financed by taxes, most r buried under them. Democracy is better as dictatorship, but is still the majority voting to take from minority. What is 'fair' for a socialist, is theft from another. Roads/transportation would be far better if done by private enterprise.
349 2018-04-09 23:18:01 Risotto :s
350 2018-04-09 23:17:58 Me too!!
351 2018-04-09 23:17:46 Going back to your video from today.... Are you not worry that the whales which will come and inject big money into crypto may be able to manipulate the market with massive sell off or buy in????? I’d rather see many new people to see and invest in this future technology!!!
352 2018-04-09 23:17:45 $SKY up over 13.06% past 24 hours #Cryptocurrency #Crypto
353 2018-04-09 23:17:43 And for you to assume they're dealing with a lot of shit due to gender is factless. Show me where any women are saying they're mistreated? Crypto is filled with progressive people more so than any other field.

417 2018-04-09 23:11:11 I would never shill a shitcoin like Verge to my followers. This is a pump based off the “biggest partnership ever”  It will dump, HARD. Chasing green candles, in a bear market, on a shitcoin, off a hype announcement, sounds like the dumbest thing you could do

426 2018-04-09 23:10:11 You should chart it yourself. :) 
Even with 40y of experience on market he can be wrong. And a prediction is worthless without the underlying strategy.

442 2018-04-09 23:07:52 Yup I agree with this. I've see it so many times in crypto
443 2018-04-09 23:07:36 One common mistake is trying to value the cryptocurrency, when you should value the blockchain technology behind it and the team+community supporting that technology.
444 2018-04-09 23:07:34 This isn't a shit post.. WTF m8
445 2018-04-09 23:07:31 Don't expect much. They refuse to disable my 2FA after several emails promising to help.

456 2018-04-09 23:06:14 To be honest, 1st step to successful trading is to follow @cryptomocho and the likes @Crypto_Bitlord @notsofast, @CryptoCred, @TheCoinKings etc, then you'll be needing @cryptoHITMAN to tell you how to make clean getaways with @cryptomocho returns from your...

463 2018-04-09 23:06:01 Kind of nice to look at one of your online wallets and see the daily profits.  When it comes to crypto, be diverse... mine, trade, invest, and find you an opportunity to promote.  Of course make sure you have income streams outside of this niche as well.

465 2018-04-09 23:05:39 BLUE is what thy crypto space is missing.  The CFTC and SEC have motioned for crypto to regulate itself, and BLUE is a step in that direction by providing security solutions to users and exchanges.

563 2018-04-09 22:58:13 Words change meaning due to the way people use them. In crypto, “scam” usually means the person doesn’t like the project or coin, not that it’s illegal and violating a specific law. Since there’s always someone that doesn’t like a coin, realize everything in crypto is a “scam”.
564 2018-04-09 22:58:09 Good for you :) Still can't believe it took me til december 2017 to even know there was an entire market for crypto. But glad I'm in even this early. Just wish I was in when you could buy millions of xvg for $100.
565 2018-04-09 22:58:07 I like women in crypto. But nothing about coinbase makes me glad. Nothing to do with gender.
566 2018-04-09 22:58:01 “...but buy TRX” hahaha made me lol irl
567 2018-04-09 22:57:57 It's very simple. There shouldn't be any need to specifically point out that THESE WOMEN GOT HIRED AWMG. People with qualifications will be hired. Doesn't matter what ethnicity, doesn't matter what if men or women (Because there's only 2 genders btw, in case you didn't know)
568 2018-04-09 22:57:54 Agreed. i have no f*ck to give wether youre a woman, man, old, young... as long as you perform your job better than others.
569 2018-04-09 22:57:43 Time to join. It is worth to look at it.  #Elementh #CrowdSale #crypto #ICO
570 2018-04-09 22:57:43 So what do you know about how women are actually treated?  What are your experiences? I am pretty sure they have to deal with a lot of shit due to their gender regardless of environment and even more so in crypto
571 2018-04-09 22:57:40 Good stuff mate
572 2018-04-09 22:57:29 Lol these crypto "experts" and "thought leaders" are getting slaughtered. Bring on more pain. Pain will help get rid of weakness and make us stronger. Just like life. I'm down about 5k in my long. Preparing to go lower to flush out some weakness.
573 2018-04-09 22:57:25 Haven't been actively watching-buying new(to my basket) crypto, I have over 100 coins-tokens in asst accts......until NOW. Thanks for the "tip!!!"..locked and loaded on Huobi now :)
574 2018-04-09 22:56:50 The POINT of his post is that the MORE we focus on inclusion OR exclusion of EITHER of the (3 now) genders, the more we worsen the problem. Her post creates gender tension. If you want equality, ACT EQUAL by saying “bada$$ people”. We want balance, not a seesaw of power-shift
575 2018-04-09 22:56:49 It’s interesting to see the anti mining news being spread by the media. At the end of the day the system only works if the wealth creation of tokens comes from the bottom up. This is sadly the current system crypto is trying to overcome.
576 2018-04-09 22:56:44

578 2018-04-09 22:56:37 This is absolutely disgusting. How is this caucasian women even  employed when we have highly experienced multi-cultural women who should be considered first.

580 2018-04-09 22:56:18 Of course, best scenario will be high spec value and big utility value, but then the risk of overvaluation will put off many.

Not everything in crypto should be a security.

587 2018-04-09 22:55:02 I remember months back it already starting on Twitter. Stating they were being treated unfairly by the Twitter Crypto community. There wasnt/isnt a gender issue, but the feminists looking to be victims will claim as much and start one. It's a cancer to crypto

609 2018-04-09 22:51:35 VCs are simply cleverly positioned in crypto. Not at all dead.

615 2018-04-09 22:51:23 Correct, it isn’t on @coinmarketcap yet. The github has been growing but these guys seemed to have ignored the communities request for addition. Regardless, yes, SENT is not listed on CMC yet.

618 2018-04-09 22:51:16 RBI and Indian government's current stand on crypto is both terrible and contradictory. When PM Modi first tweeted about Blockchain almost randomly in Feb, I predicted that someone maybe planning to use the blockchain agenda as a tool for the 2019 elections.

643 2018-04-09 22:48:22 That explains the problems im having
644 2018-04-09 22:48:20 Cryptocoins are tickets to a thing. If the thing is worthwhile, the ticket will have value. If the thing is just a promise that the tickets will have value, the tickets will not have value.  Don't invest in crypto unless you know what special access it grants.
645 2018-04-09 22:48:15 The eternal struggle with crypto being 24/7:

Price looming just above/below where you want to enter, pressure and volume mounting, and you have to go and do that annoying thing called sleep

650 2018-04-09 22:47:35 It’s legit because Crypto is a long term investment and it is here to stay. Of course the “world elite” know about what’s going to happen this year that’s why they’ve been investing in secret before they went public with all of this.

679 2018-04-09 22:44:02 Wow— confirmation crypto isn’t going anywhere.
680 2018-04-09 22:43:55 Eg. Bitcoin or Ethereum didn’t patent crypto so that companies like yours would be free to launch their own crypto currencies

800 2018-04-09 22:25:06 Interesting
801 2018-04-09 22:24:50 Simple idea to show use is to just use LTC and buy more LTC to replace it. Soon after people understand how to do that, there will be a time where you will be paid in crypto and replace/pay for something else.
802 2018-04-09 22:24:41 Crypto is not “taxable” only fiat, only if you want fiat you will be forced to pay taxes. Just a reminder
803 2018-04-09 22:24:39 Remind me again - How did that MSNBC mention go for Ripple.?.
804 2018-04-09 22:24:36 I think one approach could be to measure the revenue the eco system - a token / crypto currency spans -  could make. The interesting part about crypto space is, that it could fundamentally change the way we look at business evaluations.

821 2018-04-09 22:21:50 $BTC - Not much to report but keep an eye around $6450. Potential bounce point but if it falls through then we'll see more heavy drops. Around $6630 at the moment for support but weak by comparison. #bitcoin #crypto
822 2018-04-09 22:21:33 Written by a guy who's never use crypto clearly. A majority of his articles have extremely negative sentiment.
823 2018-04-09 22:21:28 UTNP is ready to go to top 10 crypto market cap. Anywhere in the top ten will value it at over $1 each. Currently it’s under 2 cents!! @COBINHOOD @Universa_News @universamoon @NicTrades

825 2018-04-09 22:20:47 Just stay in crypto and you will never pay taxes, risky yes, imposible ? Not. Use decentralised exchanges, and try to avoid fiat always you can. Avoid taxes is more easy people think, just research it. That law is useless.

853 2018-04-09 22:17:15 Perhaps they used an older version of jsbn? It looks like crypto.getRandomValues was only added in v1.4 (July 2013). Note also that even if a CSPRNG is used to initialise state, this is passed through RC4 (generating some biased bits).

937 2018-04-09 22:06:26 Crypto is full of such dick swinging but it is born out of the concept of money, which is still very much ego survivalism. Its the best4 now. Just gotta b real w/myself.  Perhaps we can accomplish a tad of altruism as a result & next step into complete trust & faith w/out fear
938 2018-04-09 22:06:15 Any idea of why crypto daily stopped doing videos?
939 2018-04-09 22:06:15 I am planning to start opening cryptocafe's around the globe in 2019 right because of this reason :) we need some space where to meet, except twitter,discord,slack,bct etc.
940 2018-04-09 22:06:01 Haven't got any private sales going on currently so invested in some PRL and NEO. wonder what they are gonna do the upcoming days.
941 2018-04-09 22:05:55 The wave of crypto people that came on around the time I am assuming you started (correct me if wrong, summer 2017?) had the same issue. I tried so hard to convince many to at least take out their investment

1005 2018-04-09 21:59:42 You're damn right.

1006 2018-04-09 21:59:35 @Alexandra933 nice meeting you at #coinfest. Loving the @AdvTechPodcast you did on @singularity_net! Check out @KambriaNetwork I can make an intro to the team perhaps. #crypto #blockchain #futuretech 
1007 2018-04-09 21:59:34 So want to go 
1008 2018-04-09 21:59:33 lol sure "real" crypto enthousiasts supporting censorship ... >_>
No, Us real bitcoin supporters (been using bitcoin since <2013) stand behind @bitcoin and are pro-adoption and against censorship. And have indeed forked off as BCH to retain the real bitcoin as Satoshi envisioned.
1009 2018-04-09 21:59:29 Hmmm, not sure. Lol. Let me get back to you on this
1010 2018-04-09 21:59:26 Lol I had to read it twice, TRX and Verge are new bloods in the space. It’s like seniors ripping on freshman in high school
1011 2018-04-09 21:59:16 @ElliottWins hey "Wannabe Open Source rockstar" (from StackOverflow profile) - there is a well funded startup in the crypto space... 

Your profile was high for "node" but after having a closer look it's iOS and Swift primarily.
1012 2018-04-09 21:59:15 Ikr crazy
1013 2018-04-09 21:58:38 Wow look @ this line-up!!!!!!
1014 2018-04-09 21:58:33 Ahh come on it's not that bad, we're hitting trend lines, volatility is going to happen. You see DGX is nearly ready? Going to be able to buy properly backed gold, silver, copper and oil soon using crypto 
1015 2018-04-09 21:58:21 Gotta respect the t.a.
1016 2018-04-09 21:57:46 Looks like every BCore shill has more than one account. Why do you register fake accounts to pump BCore and defame Bitcoin? Is that how you were disciplined by BSCore Cartel in censored cesspool?
1017 2018-04-09 21:57:39 What field? A crypto startup is looking for marketing and technical writing interns!

1022 2018-04-09 21:56:46 I think there is a sub-world behind all about TA and financial markets with paid courses, financials advices and things like that. Phil give on a hand for everyone that knowledge, he make looks easy. La envidia es muy mala. Your the one Phil

1024 2018-04-09 21:56:32 Most of the market is down right now, but not by a big percentage. Alts look bottomed out and so does $BTC. A lot of people are hoping for that double bottom bounce for BTC if is continues to breakdown. Very important to watch price action in April. #crypto #cryptocurrency
1025 2018-04-09 21:56:18 How do I benefit from running a trx node on either the test or main net in future? Is a trx node like a masternode in other currencies & you pay out for participating in the teon network? If so, what are the payouts?A bit of info be appreciated.

The RBI's decision is wrong, wants to create a digital India and want to stop the digital currency itself.

Don’t forget governments yell “corruption!” to distract from their own tricks.

1122 2018-04-09 21:43:00 China is also a communist power that has banned Freedom of Information and has restricted basic rights such as internet access. As far as crypto investors, there are currently around 25 million BTC wallets, which puts my estimate at around under 10 million global traders/users.

1138 2018-04-09 21:41:15 There's an indicator other than RSI?
1139 2018-04-09 21:41:11 The simple fact that there is already a coin called bitcoin with that exact same logo and that this coin is not BCH. This is the reality outside the BCH fan bubble. Even non crypto people know which coin is called bitcoin, they know its logo and the price associated.
1140 2018-04-09 21:40:54 depends on the tool - SEO / marketing earlier is better unless it involves outreach, then it needs to be perfect or say banking or crypto.

1177 2018-04-09 21:35:05 @Crypto_Bitlord So next to ‘mainly red, some green’ candles, there’ll be a brown candle introduced to cryptospace?

1231 2018-04-09 21:29:31 Should be obvious, but it isn't....excellent advice. MSM coverage of crypto is 24 to 48 hrs late--AT BEST. In crypto world, that might as well be two years. I sold my #XRP just below high water--right when TV coverage was peak.
1232 2018-04-09 21:29:19 Crypto hasn't crossed the chasm yet. There's no point in targeting the mainstream audience if the early adopters (who are tolerant to bad UX) aren't fully onboard with the current state of technology.
1233 2018-04-09 21:29:18 As per central banks, they are independent of the gov't (at least here in the US), and do not have regulatory power. And personally, I have not encountered issues with Bank/Crypto transfers. I do anticipate increased regulation worldwide, but not against banking, rather ICO's.
1234 2018-04-09 21:29:17 Commitment of traders report will show commercial and non commercial positions.
1235 2018-04-09 21:29:01 Why are you being redundant? Crypto means blockchain!

1237 2018-04-09 21:28:29 Ya - the crypto miner thing doesn't interest me there. What does is the usage of blockchain for digital ownership and they create an angle with the digital resales for players and also for devs by giving them a portion of those sales

1257 2018-04-09 21:25:15 To be fair - they have a team that could do it and signed some notables. I'm less interested in the crypto side and more the blockchain side of it technologically for also things like digital items. Still Steam competitor is a huge uphill battle
1258 2018-04-09 21:24:37 So often I see cryptocurrency people saying “crypto doesn’t have any good quality critics.”

Well, I’d say it’s because you’re all in an echo chamber. There’s plenty of nuanced critique out there.
1259 2018-04-09 21:24:26 This underscores the disruptive potential of crypto. Inefficient banks (that’s literally all of them) will be under pressure to innovate for the benefit of the consumer (which in anatema to banks). PSD2 offers some promise but may result in a walled garden. The future is crypto!

1283 2018-04-09 21:21:37 If "TEAM" isn't in your #crypto site's main navigation, and you're not already so big that you're beyond that, then either you're hiding something or you're too dumb to know how important that is for fundamental analysis.
1284 2018-04-09 21:21:28 @Bitcoin listen man can you at least tweet from the $BCH handle, bitcoin has chosen lightning network as their scaling solution. I would stop bashing the majority chain with this account. You are hurting the reputation of crypto.
1285 2018-04-09 21:21:18 “People put more faith in a guy named Satoshi Nakamoto that no one has ever met than they do in the U.S. Fed."
Translation: "We have to get rid of this shit!"

1287 2018-04-09 21:21:08 Yeah i figured, just american problems anyways lol. So most of our fast food places have a value menu, which is comprised of food items for only $1. Basically cheap food, not good for you, and somehow super addictive.
1288 2018-04-09 21:20:58 Definitely is! Eventually if you aren’t accepting crypto you’ll be left beind so you might as well help lead the charge
1289 2018-04-09 21:20:39 I am amazed at how many prominent crypto personalities vilify verge so much.. it is almost as if they have a nice, friendly relationship with another privacy coin starting with M and ending in O. Also, Fluffy Pony features on their podcasts. lol. Fucking sham.

1355 2018-04-09 21:14:15 Crypto-currencies rip the mask off the banks and the deceptions they weave!  Digital money can be moved in a matter of seconds, and verified and confirmed in a matter minutes, and leave a permanent digital record accounting, that is transparent, of each and every transaction.

1395 2018-04-09 21:09:44 I hate when other work distracts me from crypto

So close to making this full-time. I'm thinking I need to find that next gear of hustle and grind.
1396 2018-04-09 21:09:37 I agree that people are quick to cry manipulation, but it was blatant last night.
1397 2018-04-09 21:09:16 Thanks and right back atcha, @_gungeet - YOU'RE awesome!! And a huge congratulations!!
1398 2018-04-09 21:09:14 Brilliant loved it pls share more in the future

1400 2018-04-09 21:09:09 細かい額のビットコインを大量に受け取っていると（例えば，1時間ごとに自動受信する形のハイプで）「過去に受信した多くの小規模な決済を統合する必要」のために，送金手数料があとで多額になる可能性があるような気がします。

1403 2018-04-09 21:08:55 It has a great effect when bullish volume is low and price is timidly trying to break upward. You need serious momentum to eat through nearly 6k bitcoin. 5726*7k=a shit ton of money. And that's only to move price up <$20.

1409 2018-04-09 21:08:14 Don't listen to me, I was one of the guys saying Scotland should adopt a crypto currency as our main unit of exchange during the #Indyref debate. It was worth around £50 At that time and is now worth £4720. Another case of "What if" Scotlands history is full of "What ifs"

1431 2018-04-09 21:05:16 No idea where we are really at in this chart in regards to #crypto. Just buying some BTC and ALTs that I like to offset “somewhat safer” stocks and standard investments. DYOR. 
1432 2018-04-09 21:05:13 I agree with that, and in time, the market may form a similar bubble. A lot of companies are BS, and likely only 10% will survive. But crypto is no different than stocks - it comes down to Present Value. If a crypto is expected to grow (more revenue), it's price will increase...
1433 2018-04-09 21:04:53 @MichaelSuppo ? Oh yeah, because he knows nothing about crypto!

1514 2018-04-09 20:58:05 No but I’ve been less active in crypto twitter since it’s been an altogether down year.  All my cryptos are sitting in wallets and I have no interest in leverage trading or day trading.
1515 2018-04-09 20:57:53 great piece. While inelasticity is a problem, the biggest problem with crypto is that it attempts to solve the trust problem in a credit/debt relationship by having no debtor. Unfortunately, no debt means no credit
1516 2018-04-09 20:57:52 can't even recall the last time i checked my crypto portfolio
1517 2018-04-09 20:57:45 Is there a coin out there that you hated that you missed their ICO and is now undervalued ?

1525 2018-04-09 20:56:19 Eventually under $1? What are you talking about? Seriously.
1526 2018-04-09 20:55:43 If you have access to high frequency trading, this might make sense. Otherwise, you will be chasing the peaks and dips futilely. 
Ag and Au over the past 5 years have possibly held wealth against a debased $USD, otherwise, margins have been very small. Crypto may be the only play

1537 2018-04-09 20:54:13 Remember all that $FSN scam talk? Surprisingly stable through all this BTC volatility. Holding since ICO and likely a lot longer. Anyone interested in Hexx, I would stay away at this point. Not too thrilled with what I've seen in deeper research.

1547 2018-04-09 20:52:31 IDK the exact breakdown of the $2 billion, but like I mentioned, that is not reliant on transactions such as Groceries. Where Bitcoin and other crypto's have value is in transfers and FOREX. I waited 5 days for a Schwab transfer last week - I could've done it in hours with crypto

1573 2018-04-09 20:48:40 So the upshot is if you get into crypto for transactional purposes rather than for long-term investment, and use it to get paid and to buy stuff, you'll have to do complicated capital gains calculations every time you trade one?

1623 2018-04-09 20:44:56 If the value accrues in token then it function as a security.

I yet to see a single token economy, where token price depends on economic rights and not pure speculative premium.

Also incentives can be designed intoalmost any system, not only crypto-networks.

1632 2018-04-09 20:44:30 There is a Crypto Addict Anonymous group...it’s called Twitter

1639 2018-04-09 20:43:27 I’m no longer shocked by how many crypto reactionaries are masquerading around with a guise of piety around here.
1640 2018-04-09 20:43:25  okay... 
1641 2018-04-09 20:43:25 $btcp is only a disaster if you bought high and held through the fork. Look back at zcl timeline. Plenty of 1-2x dios near the last weeks. $hxx has plenty of time.
1642 2018-04-09 20:43:16 Leave shill nye alone. He’s twice the weed smoker you’ll ever be.
1643 2018-04-09 20:43:09 That it has.  It was the product of a late night topia expedition several months ago.  One of those zero or hero type purchases.
1644 2018-04-09 20:43:00 He’s literally the reason we’re at $6600 now. If you think he “plans” to get into crypto trading you’re foolish. He’s been in it since late 2017 and is manipulating the fuck out of us

1669 2018-04-09 20:39:58 Which part of it makes you super bullish?
1670 2018-04-09 20:39:58 Yeah Malta has something like a citizenship where you have to pay 16000 pound I guess for rental on a 5 year contract and you get citizenship or if you buy property on a 5 year contract then you get citizenship.
1671 2018-04-09 20:39:57 Wont go below 6 imo

1678 2018-04-09 20:39:28 My point? It's a pre pump from 10 cents to 40 dollars, theft, and a centralized spreadsheet where users need to waste time doing PoW to modify their own entries. It is falsely advertised as free Tx, and it is not. The PoS=joke, no +/- incentives f/ validation/collusion.

1681 2018-04-09 20:38:57 God this like catching a falling knife.  It was too early to introduce the futures market in such a low liquidity market.  Wall Street a$$holes.

1684 2018-04-09 20:38:41 I saw @Earl_Crypto giving a spectacular call on this one - missed the initial pump so I decided not to chase it but it's been a great ride for whoever managed to get in
1685 2018-04-09 20:38:32 Verge=bitconnect . What is so sad is so many people believe in it, and they are knocking us out as quick as they can. But they can keep the "eth" giveaway scam all the time. Lol I will take the profit before it blows.

1697 2018-04-09 20:36:59 Lots of $crypto have pumped on news of partnerships and dipped down.. $xrp is just one example. This isn’t to say the partnership is weak but people buying the news aren’t they
1698 2018-04-09 20:36:38 Not true. There is a value proposition for crypto which depends on networks designed with proper incentives for all participants. Value then accrues to the tokens and u need to view the network as a micro-economy. Just bc market got ahead of itself doesnt invalidate the concept
1699 2018-04-09 20:36:30 Not seeing a lot of chatter about what $HXX has done this week, which is good because I still have some of my bag left sitting on roughly a 25x...
1700 2018-04-09 20:36:17 Revolut is better than your bank's credit or debit card. Forget about crypto though, totally irrelevant. Everyone in Europe uses Revolut when travelling as all our banks forget we are an Union when it's convenient

1703 2018-04-09 20:35:50 That's like crypto twitter quote fractals
1704 2018-04-09 20:35:46 Assuming your device the data is stored on malfunctions and like you said it’s stored on blocks. How would somebody retrieve the data from the blocks? Also if it’s stored on blocks(encrypted code on a device) that means it can still be accessed by the right hacker.

1758 2018-04-09 20:30:29 So when Bitcoin Core eventually hard forks to change its block size, which LN would require at scale, or to implement any other HF-only feature and so becomes incompatible with old software, it'll leave Bitcoin. Don't answer that, I can foresee your double standard excuses.

1773 2018-04-09 20:29:17 If the Rock had libertarianish views, then sure. He seems like a respectable enough person. It's all about the ideology to me. It's embarrassing that so many people would choose @BernieSanders over Ron Paul in the crypto field. MAYBE Bernie over the others...but over Ron? Smh.
1774 2018-04-09 20:29:04 $BTC / #crypto markets could be falling partially due to physical hedging pressure.

Thus, physical & OTC buyers would sell the derivative & futures to hedge against further market drops while they build cheap physical positions.

When market bottoms, unwind hedge & ride the wave
1775 2018-04-09 20:28:57 And Bitcoin Core is a Bitcoin implementation, not a coin.
1776 2018-04-09 20:28:48 Both Billions and Silicon Valley mention crypto in this week’s episodes. 
1777 2018-04-09 20:28:37 Leverage is a investment tool. It's not going away. The larger question is if crypto is actually an advised investment vs a complete roll of the dice (and for the record I'm very big on crypto).

1801 2018-04-09 20:25:28 It's pretty simple. If you didn't change the software you were running, you never left Bitcoin. If you're running new compatible software you too are still using Bitcoin. If you started running incompatible software you left Bitcoin.

1886 2018-04-09 20:13:57 Whoooooooooh shit
1887 2018-04-09 20:13:54 Honestly, I love both communities, we are, hands down, the top 2 communities in crypto
1888 2018-04-09 20:13:39 Looking insanely grim.  Unless of course you’re less than 40 this could be a buying opportunity of a lifetime (assuming it does t get so bad it triggers mass job loss)
1889 2018-04-09 20:13:27 I get the feeling you are a noob who recently just started investing in crypto few months/weeks ago.
1890 2018-04-09 20:13:23 But Verge and Tron are the highest quality projects around, SMDH fudders!!!!
1891 2018-04-09 20:12:43 The daily circle jerk of crypto "investors" continues unabated.
1892 2018-04-09 20:12:32 They expect an #VXG (Verge) announcement on April 16th or 17th. Better fill up your bags mate #vergecurrency #XVG #verge #altcoins #Litecoin #bitcoin
1893 2018-04-09 20:12:26 #TRX is the future.
1894 2018-04-09 20:12:02 Tinder?
1895 2018-04-09 20:11:59 Mainly Pinnacle, CRIS, and local accounts. For crypto betting, I use Nitrogen.
1896 2018-04-09 20:11:55 a great opportunity to invest and to make a good profit. Very promising project with a powerful idea.

1897 2018-04-09 20:11:39 A lot of guys are exited about the entrance of George Soros into the crypto world. Btw I would guess, he is still Long or short. He is not that kind of trader who announced first, that he will invest a large amount. I believe, he is still in the game since a while!
1898 2018-04-09 20:11:23 So I have the IP of someone who tried to hack into one of my crypto exchange accounts. So what do I do with this
1899 2018-04-09 20:11:11 An FYI for those of you following my @blocksplain posts. Due to the arrival of my baby boy over the weekend, I probably won’t get any posts done (or get much sleep, for that matter). But I will be back into the crypto world next week :)
1900 2018-04-09 20:11:06 Not a bad idea. Not only you could meet other traders, but you would be liable to pay only 2% tax on your crypto gains!!! CRAAAAZY isn’t it?!

1934 2018-04-09 20:07:17 Agreed! I got 50% of my holdings on BitGrail and watched the whole scene unravel. Luckily I got my Nano off the exchange in the nick of time. BitGrail neglected the whole situation and are 100% to blame! A fork would be insanity
1935 2018-04-09 20:07:06 .. som fx. det dansk-funderede makerdao, som har 40 ansatte (som i øvrigt alle aflønnes i 100% crypto), og som langtsomt men sikkert er ved at sætte sig på det meget vigtige stablecoin-marked. Sidst sker der vild teknologisk innovation især indenfor performance og governance.

1940 2018-04-09 20:06:36 Pretty wide range for a bottom. 5800->3000 almost 50% drop.
1941 2018-04-09 20:06:23 If that is the case, guess name could be changed from wall street to Crypto street..
1942 2018-04-09 20:06:07 ADA is not about the short pumps via announcements of partnerships or Airdrops ant this whole shit. It's meant to be the bitcoin of tge future. It doesn't need this kind of stupid punlicity. People like you are the reason that the crypto space is so fucked right now.

1958 2018-04-09 20:03:55 true, there‘s still lots of money to be made in the meantime! Especially in the crypto space. Just something to be aware of and to watch, because, sooner or later the ones who own the best AI will win. 
It already proved it can beat us at chess, go, poker, so why not at trading.

2010 2018-04-09 19:59:28 Looking at depth charts (ones with fewer fake orders) I'd guess we're close to the bottom for #btc and #crypto in general
2011 2018-04-09 19:59:26 Üstat iyi aksamlar, sizce btc 4,5k ya düşer mi? BTC alacağım ama şuanki fiyattan aldıktan sonra düşmesinden korkuyorum :( Değerli yorumunuzu  rica ederim. Teşekkürler

2013 2018-04-09 19:59:02 Who are you with these constant gloating posts: The forth rider of the crypto apocalypse?
2014 2018-04-09 19:59:02 Something wrong . I started to follow legit ass gifs and cat gifs more than crypto related thing wtf going on is that when magic happens ? 
2015 2018-04-09 19:59:01 Maybe that wasn't the bottom. It is possible we are going down to the next support levels. #crypto #BTC #BCH #ETH #XLM/#STR #IOTA #SC #TRX #XVG (TRX and XVG looks resilient but there are signs of capitulation already).

2030 2018-04-09 19:57:49 If you swap Marxist for Fascist, this is correct. Fascists don't like to be identified as Fascists but in general, you don't get crypto-Stalinists or Alt-Left folk because the Left, in general, has always been open about what they are, including the shitty elements on the Left.
2031 2018-04-09 19:57:47 Yeah I've used Bitcoin ATMs and flexpin recently... @BMO is apparently blocking all crypto related transactions?
2032 2018-04-09 19:57:37 That’s a metaphor. The future is bright.
2033 2018-04-09 19:56:58 Still so early in the crypto game. We have yet to see even the beginnings of adoption on a large scale.

2036 2018-04-09 19:56:23 Long story short = ASIC needs to go if we want truly democratized crypto?
2037 2018-04-09 19:56:18 We shouldn’t have to pay capital gains taxes on crypto profits until regulators agree on what crypto actually is.

2051 2018-04-09 19:54:28 Hard part is NOW the GFX market is largely inflated due to crypto miners. So any GFX investment right now is a waste of money. JMO.

2060 2018-04-09 19:52:53 If the dream is to make India digital, digital/crypto currency should be legalised, not banned. While all countries are accepting/regulating Bitcoin/Cryptos, we are moving in opposite direction. RBI, please rethink

2074 2018-04-09 19:51:57 BTC itself is damaged goods. Dumb money will not buy into it again for a while. It will go critically low & On the long run the winner will be some crypto that we can't yet imagine, but some will claim they knew all along. Focus on the big picture --> BTC has lost it's value.

2166 2018-04-09 19:42:26 Yeah, I only left small amounts in myself. Really don't care what price btc goes to as long it stabilizes somewhat and alts can do their thing.
2167 2018-04-09 19:42:09 It may not feel like it, but widespread adoption is becoming more and more prevalent. This is just the beginning. #Crypto

2169 2018-04-09 19:41:41 Or you could buy a flight ticket with your bitcoins from btctrip and go to a plave where they have btc atms and withdraw cash. Sounds stupid but you get a nice vacation instead of using that money for crypto taxes

Well they will sell it expeciver you count on that!

2322 2018-04-09 19:22:31 Wasn't a 51% attack. It was a hash attack with spoofed timestamps. The hardfork makes the coins they got essentially useless

2331 2018-04-09 19:21:30 Well maybe we could squeeze in a bit to fill the gap before the coin burn. BTC is holding all these eager alts back from fulfilling their destinies. Moon-bound crypto will leap towards their future soon enough.

2409 2018-04-09 19:14:49 Are you asking me? 

That’s ridiculous for me to comment. 

I do not have enough intel to be in a position to answer that. Actually 99.9% of people are not in an position of the know. 
I would need regular intel briefings to understand current situation.

2508 2018-04-09 19:05:57 still love that they don't know $XVG was formerly doge coin dark
2509 2018-04-09 19:05:55 I believe that #Photochain project will be able to realize its idea and take a worthy place in the crypto industry @Photochain_io
2510 2018-04-09 19:05:48 I cant be arsed because I’d need to sit up and turn on my PC. I stopped looking at shitcoins in January I just tug my cock to my BTC shorts now. Thanks for the lesson though fam really appreciate it

2512 2018-04-09 19:05:30 You have a lair!? Nice..
2513 2018-04-09 19:05:27 So many of you wanting XRP added, you do realize that your support for such a coin basically goes against the principles that crypto and blockchain was formed from, right? CB needs to focus on user abilities first and foremost. Canadians still can’t cash out
2514 2018-04-09 19:05:24 Ne nous demandons pas si ce qu’on fait dans les cryptos c’est rentable.. ceux qui ont mine du $BTC y’a 9 ans c’était pas rentable et il le faisait quand même
2515 2018-04-09 19:05:23 They, him, her. Satoshi Nakamoto, who knows this sudos true identity or even if it is a sudo.

If they, him, her, why not, It. It could be an it, couldn't it?

Almost all alts are in accumulation stages, so take your pick. Find the ones with the best fundamentals and stock up.

2539 2018-04-09 19:03:26 Seem  to me the safe play is more exposure to gold and silver and maybe a little in crypto.
2540 2018-04-09 19:03:13 Then we should all buy xrp? Becouse the rich allways win and i want to be on the winning site for once!

2622 2018-04-09 18:57:18 and is #crypto bullish on/in EU? :-P
2623 2018-04-09 18:57:17 I did sell from 20k many times.
2624 2018-04-09 18:57:11 learn to do the opposite of consensus and you will thrive in crypto.
2625 2018-04-09 18:57:04 Youtubers still refusing to acknowledge what $XVG has been doing for the past few weeks. Why is that? @crypto_bobby @Nicholas_Merten @cryptodailyuk @boxmining @Altcoinbuzzio @carterthomas

2632 2018-04-09 18:55:54 make sure if you’re a noob to crypto you leverage a lot to start and try to outsmart the market right away...then when you get rekt you can begin figuring out how to actually make money doing counter-intuitive things like betting against the massive short lining up.
2633 2018-04-09 18:55:46 Bitcoin hear us about blockchain technology. So if you are going to adopt blockchain technology why don't you legalize #Bitcoin the mother of Crypto? #isupportcrypto @PMOIndia @arunjaitley @RBI @ZeeBusiness @CNBC_Awaaz @abpnewstv @ajtak_news

2638 2018-04-09 18:55:42 @crypto_rand why is Verge alive?
2639 2018-04-09 18:55:39 90% of the world's data was generated in the last 2 years. This fact is insane. Therefore, going into the future there will be so much more data that institutions would value. The data of the future will be the basis of a new economy entirely.

2649 2018-04-09 18:54:24 Exactly if you want to go further goes together. But I don’t see the Cardano foundation trying to get more people into crypto. How can normal people get Cardano ? I don’t see any kind of promotion or education for normal users. I complaining cuz I care about Cardano
2650 2018-04-09 18:54:23 TOKENS are meant to fund projects and have lots of legal ramifications, including being 'approved' and having a white paper. Please make sure the term #Crypto is correct here and you're not simply referring to a loyalty program/incentives. Does this run a #blockchain?

2659 2018-04-09 18:53:18 When something is in an accumulation cycle it has low volume lol. Not to say that means you should buy something, as many will go to 0 and cease to exist. But if it has good fundamentals it will survive the accumulation cycle and pop. Low volume is actually a reversal indicator

1) High net worth clients are investing crypto personally.

Fun fact though, BTC is the most traded thing on OTCQX.

2772 2018-04-09 18:42:50 The end goal is to fight off centralisation which crypto as a whole was supposed to be about. Taking power away from the big corporations and banks that just want to control everything. This is what ETH supposedly stood for.

2875 2018-04-09 18:32:55 But here's the thing... asking for 75 million xvg to fund a partnership isn't keeping it on the dl until it's ready.
2876 2018-04-09 18:32:54 Yeah Hold for sure, of buy den more! VERGE BREAKS ALL RECORDS ANY TIME NOW!  
2877 2018-04-09 18:32:53 Twitter race? 
2878 2018-04-09 18:32:46 @adndotcom Alaska needs to invest into #Crypto and #BlockChain Technology. 

Also more businesses need to accept #Crypto as payments as its the future of our economy. Its faster, easier, and safer.

2880 2018-04-09 18:32:42 But will @squawkfox attend EDCON and restore her faith  (via @ljxie "...Here are a few upcoming crypto events that appear to be high quality and worth checking out: - ...May 3-5: EDCON (Toronto) ..."
2881 2018-04-09 18:32:41 I can see that after taxes.. the big crypto event is done. So from may it looks like the uptrend to december begins.
Noone knows just hoping
2882 2018-04-09 18:32:41 Thanks man! Happy to see you picking up some well earned attention
2883 2018-04-09 18:32:39 I know you have no responsibility to do this, but it’s appreciated and I believe helps build a better crypto twitter.
2884 2018-04-09 18:32:32 I also saw something similar at the Tron foundation, but I think I already learned my lesson, "Nothing is free"
I lost not much (0.6 Ether) but even 1 cent, it is my hard earned money... So people, keep your eyes open, Crypto space it is full of scammers...
2885 2018-04-09 18:32:25 whose graves will you dance on harder? Stock bears or crypto bulls?

2888 2018-04-09 18:31:59 I was thinking about buying gold and silver. But honestly the fact that the higher the price goes the more they mine will always keep price low. Watching you tube vids from 2011 and the fever for precious metal and knowing how the price went down today turns me off silver and gol

2908 2018-04-09 18:30:32 It depends on your timeframe.  It's been a great store of value for any timeline over 2 years.  However, due to extreme volatility, it fails over shorter time frames.  This is the reality we find ourselves in today.  This isn't bitcoin specific.  This is true for *all* crypto.

2936 2018-04-09 18:27:32 I think everyone has been wrong in crypto one way or another. I made many wrong guesses. I bought verge at 120 sats and sold at 960 sats. I'm not sad that I sold cause that's 800% profit but I'm frustrated that it could have been more, and that's called greed, lol.

2954 2018-04-09 18:26:03 I think with the Facebook privacy situation, investors may be looking at privacy coins as having a use-case outside of anonymity.

3002 2018-04-09 18:21:20 Finally someone who says the same thing I’ve said all this time! I came in like a noob and a few weeks into the crypto world realized this guy has no idea what he is taking about!
3003 2018-04-09 18:21:17 Love it #chatduell
3004 2018-04-09 18:21:12 I got into #crypto at the beginning of January, so pretty much the best time to trial by fire this shit.  I've measured my growth by how significantly less rekt I get with each #bitcoin dip.  Would you say this is a good indicator?
3005 2018-04-09 18:21:08 I trust this company very much. I messed up an order two weeks ago, emailed them and they got back to me within minutes and refunded my credit card on the spot. No hassle and trustworthy. My 2¢ for anyone leary of buying. Also got my nano about 2min after purchase. 
3006 2018-04-09 18:21:05 What I would find interesting to know is whether these are the same wallets that constantly appear in the top 100.
3007 2018-04-09 18:20:44 Hitesh, our Indian crypto community isn’t united yet. I think people like you can make this possible. We can stand against RBI decision like S.Koreans did.
3008 2018-04-09 18:20:30 everyone has a plan here, i respect that, but i wouldnt be that bearish on anything on crypto for the next 6 months. you could bring to the table this sentiment early january, now... the main part of the storm is gone, we are down 70% everywhere. 70% or 90% for a 5-8x
3009 2018-04-09 18:20:23 I've always wondered how it would feel like being white, have a high iq, early investor in fb and then ctrl+c, ctrl+v myself
3010 2018-04-09 18:20:21 @crypto_2D rt見て
3011 2018-04-09 18:20:18 Sometimes you got to cut cut the losers ...i cut ltc at 170...glad i did. If it hits 100 I might buy back in. Nano is see a cook project. It's a shame they sent that tweet out. Big lesson to projects to stay outta exchange problems.
3012 2018-04-09 18:20:12 It’s weird how I’ve been keeping up with crypto for a long long time now (and it’s also unstable) yet I don’t make it this huge part of my identity. Are white guys okay?
3013 2018-04-09 18:20:04 Calling it now:  @coinbase and @binance will emerge as the biggest two players in the $crypto space, similar to how powerful Amazon and Google have become.

3029 2018-04-09 18:17:55 I've seen, but you also need to convert PIV to zPIV, you can stake PIV at a different rate etc... They almost act as different coins working on the same blockchain. I find that more complicated than system used by $Nav, $GRS  or even $ZEC. Still love PIVX like I said though :)

2018 is for $VEN $WAN $OCN $DRGN etc...

3116 2018-04-09 18:11:31 Thing is the transition from Fiat to a currency with better foundation will take a lot of time, maybe longer than our lifetime. That's why we will probably never see the time when Fiat goes down
But one thing is for sure, it's better to change with times, even if little by little

There are no bitcoin factions;

3125 2018-04-09 18:10:25 Oh I'm sorry, I didn't realize I wasn't allowed to use teaching aids. Calm down killer, I was using the $BIS chart to illustrate what I look for when I am looking at volume on a coin. even though the total volume isn't perfect the volume setup on the chart looks awesome.
3126 2018-04-09 18:10:23 Most coins you look at with high potential are usually going to be low volume coins, until they pump! If you're always buying alts with extremely high volume your probably buying tops.
3127 2018-04-09 18:10:20 Until $btc recovers by the thousands and overall crypto marketcap climbs above $350b. I’m personally, bearish. It won’t last much longer, but hedging your best reforming alts to btc and some fiat to buy the dip is always safest.

3130 2018-04-09 18:10:15 Right now there's 2 POS methods. Staking and Masternode. zPIV staking (zPOS) allows you to stake without anyone knowing what's in your wallet.  Also zPOS get 50% more rewards, an incentive for users to use Zerocoin!
3131 2018-04-09 18:10:12 What do we think about the @RBI's new stance on #crypto? They announced that they are banning financial institutions from working with companies that deal in virtual currencies. Not a ban on $BTC but will make it difficult for  projects to gain access to financial infrastructure
3132 2018-04-09 18:10:07 Investing into crypto makes sense once you do the research, and keep a steady pace of doing your own due diligence.

24h volume of <$10k. ICO price of $0.85, ATH of $2.50. Chart bottomed out.

Smart oracles will be heavily utilized imo, @coinbase opening up to ERC20 + institutional players.

3411 2018-04-09 17:43:25 Literally the only reason credit cards have been successful for online shopping is because there is no real-time funds verification API for ACH that allows merchants to be certain that the buyer's funds will not bounce.

3493 2018-04-09 17:34:25 I don’t think the fait game should be over. Where will the world be once that happenes? Millions will die, streets will be in chaos, I would not want such a life for myself or others. I am okay with price fluctuations from real money, assets etc...
3494 2018-04-09 17:34:09 Nothing is decentralized until all ledger updates happen via transactions. The voters need to trust anyway some experts interpreting the update, so we're back to centralization. Decentralized information must be the first class citizen. @aantonop #bitcoin #blockchain #ico

3522 2018-04-09 17:31:28 In a year or two this company and their project will take the leading place in the crypto industry, and you will admire their idea and to what heights they could reach! Very soon the company will complete its ICO.

3630 2018-04-09 17:23:08 Bethereum is a social betting platform that connects people to play against each other, excluding bookmakers & betting agencies from the process. 
This means the money does not end up in a bookie's pocket, but remains with you, the players.  @bethereumteam #Bethereum

3635 2018-04-09 17:22:25 #Bethereum betting technology:  A versatile framework combining Ethereum-based technology with powerful tools and applications. Provably fair ; 
Fun & social.  Industry-first innovations and unique gamification and social elements bring the fun back in betting. @bethereumteam

3640 2018-04-09 17:22:05 Bitcoin is revolutionary, silver aint got no use for retailers, bitcoin could replace our day to day currency thru which we buy our bread n butter, masses will never buy silver but bitcoin will be bought

3650 2018-04-09 17:20:34 It's so important for people to realize there is no "do over" in crypto. We need to take responsibility for our own actions. In the "Game Of Crypto" we have only ourselves to blame for poor decisions. 

Make the best of each day, learn from your mistakes, & don't repeat them!
3651 2018-04-09 17:20:30 Bethereum harnesses the power of blockchain to deliver a betting platform you can fully trust. But it’s the exclusive combination of features, design 
and social elements that truly sets apart their solution from the competition.  @bethereumteam #Bethereum

3755 2018-04-09 17:14:43 That includes locked up XRP too right? With currently held/circulating supply what is it?
3756 2018-04-09 17:14:43 Majority of crypto is kids drooling about lambos and hodling BS. Roger invested in Bitcoin because it as a currency can change the world. BTC has absolutely failed as currency. BCH will achieve this goal.
3757 2018-04-09 17:14:32 Thanks for your honesty, but let me tell you that you certainly are a douche.
Regularly, I tweet set ups of coins I'm not trading and still people like you are moaning.

3776 2018-04-09 17:13:33 @bethereumteam What i like about this is that there is no minimum contribution, so even the guy with $100 networth in crypto can invest 10% of his portfolio here.
3777 2018-04-09 17:13:30 you know it very well that 5.6-5.8k would be the next stop before we try another failed rally until going down to 4.5k, why disillusion people with bullish scenarios in a clear bear trending market

Why can't we get a Satoshi pretender from among your ranks? Or at least an exit scammer? 

The ratio of con-women to con-men in crypto is like #NegativeGamma: so low, it defies math.

3785 2018-04-09 17:12:41 It's funny, I don't talk about Crypto too much to my peers because my family and friends don't really get it. Maybe one day they'll be asking me for advice? I'll just carry on educating myself till then

3841 2018-04-09 17:07:43 Yet the only ones who are DEMANDING that people purchase their crypto, and only their crypto, are the Bitcoin maximalists. (I'm personally a Bitcoin enthusiast, but just saying...!! I don't hear anyone but Bitcoin people attacking other cryptos..!!)

4003 2018-04-09 16:52:17 Not completely out tho, and that's only because we just had that huge rise from 900~ to 20k in a year, it makes sense to hedge at least a bit.
4004 2018-04-09 16:52:15 it's really generous of so many 20-something crypto traders to take time out of trading to give us their 100% confident analysis of Syria.  Next we can put the Geneva Conventions on the blockchain so bagholders can vote on attack attribution and what constitutes a war crime

4033 2018-04-09 16:50:34 I think everyone is keen for you to stop engaging with crypto-nuts and go back to insightful commentary on economics and actual money.
4034 2018-04-09 16:50:33 I got 12
4035 2018-04-09 16:50:32 NO WAY! Nice dude, I got mine yesterday all the way from Zimbabwe. Who knew I had ancestors there

4039 2018-04-09 16:50:23 I’ll go back to ignoring your petty, childish tweets and focus on the good bits. Good day.
4040 2018-04-09 16:50:19 forward it on to me@rescam.org
4041 2018-04-09 16:50:16 Literally my very first thought.
4042 2018-04-09 16:50:15 Good advice as usual. This market is very difficult even for pros, novices should definitely stay out.
4043 2018-04-09 16:50:14 So #Crypto friends. What's your base #coin of choice and why?
I'm trading in #ETH as I find it easier to #exchange to and from #fiat from the UK.
I just feel a lot of people #trade in #BTC which got me thinking
4044 2018-04-09 16:50:11 1. Its not hype 2. Not bitcoin, difficulty is way to high for GPU mining, you mean crypto in general? 3. Its already over, look at used part sites and there is a flood of Graphics cards coming in
4045 2018-04-09 16:50:04 @SimpIeToken is a seriously underrated project...

4052 2018-04-09 16:49:22 This is nothing... I got 10 million btc that Satoshi left for me before he vanished
4053 2018-04-09 16:49:17 Man do you have direct line with IMF 
Respect 
4054 2018-04-09 16:49:09 Okay  India is a good idea
4055 2018-04-09 16:49:05 6,5 is a strong support do should bounce
4056 2018-04-09 16:49:04 And why did you redact his email? Too kind, I think the guy deserves thousands of spam emails to his “confidential email”
4057 2018-04-09 16:49:01 I tend to consider elliptic curve a weakness or a #math backdoor at worst. 
$crypto #security
4058 2018-04-09 16:48:55 So... It's not a decentralized crypto currency like you said earlier?
4059 2018-04-09 16:48:50 And the you woke up on the 17th and felt left behind. No worries m8 i respect your thoughts i just dont share them
4060 2018-04-09 16:48:49 Haha I get those everyday. Spam
4061 2018-04-09 16:48:43 So your the guy that dumped the 10,000 btc this morning! :-)
4062 2018-04-09 16:48:42 1) Everyone, phishing emails, rootkits and scams are at an all time high. 

You should have 2FA activated on every account I’m Crypto and outside of crypto. If 2FA isn’t offered, then use all available layers of protection offered.
4063 2018-04-09 16:48:36 You're going to have to give them more than one bank account number to drag all that in there! 
4064 2018-04-09 16:48:36 the way i see it now is a system that prevents formation of monopolies which lead to a lack of legitimacy as participation is less incentivized. checks and balances in crypto voting systems can be achieved by ideas like quadratic voting. we do it for delegations in our erc20.

4070 2018-04-09 16:48:15 So you got my email then?

4140 2018-04-09 16:43:26 @pushpendrakum Hi Sir Ji, 
#isupportcrypto  Kya RBI india ki fiyat currency ko bhi ban kardegi agar banking scam(PNB Scam, UnionBank Scam, Axisbank scam)joki already kafi ho chuka hai unke control se door ho toh .We all support cypto. We all knows crypto is best path to success.
4141 2018-04-09 16:43:19 STOP following me, please. And please stop attacking me, it hurts me inside.
4142 2018-04-09 16:43:15 Fundamentally I’ve never been more bullish on crypto in my life  but y’all do whatever you wanna do just don’t get caught picking up pennies in front of a steam engine
4143 2018-04-09 16:43:12 75% of the criticism of Mark is misplaced anger. 

People have to blame someone, but they know deep down they signed up for this. Facebook has always used your data to pay its bills. 

Do you remember the freak outs when rumors of a paid site? 

#steemit pays you. #forgetfacebook
4144 2018-04-09 16:43:02 Facebook data leak was bad for crypto twitter. The Facebookers who deleted and switched exclusively to twitter are now using the comment sections on perfectly good tweets as an outlet for clear facebook style rants.
4145 2018-04-09 16:42:59 Ouch! I scaled in from 99k down to 67k when I stopped buying anything. I only bought that last bit at 46k when I ended up with some spare BTC on Kucoin from another trade

4161 2018-04-09 16:41:30 Obviously crypto-currencies are new technology. There are many to chose from. There are articles all over news sites discussing the differences.  Everyone knows there are versions of bitcoin. This forces a decision and thought. The differences are all layed out publicly.
4162 2018-04-09 16:41:29 The poor country like Japan should learn from a developed nation like India and Pakistan how to handle crypto coins.

4211 2018-04-09 16:35:43 When i have the chance to ask this question to both of you, i should use it.
 What do you both think of Fib spirals on Crypto?

I have a TA im working on and i would enjoy it to hear some thoughts.
4212 2018-04-09 16:35:42 Is there any $TA reason why we dropped from 7200 $BTC to 6600?

4219 2018-04-09 16:34:54 Bollinger Band pinch - it doesn't provide a directional indicator for up/down movement, but indicates upcoming volatility, so according to the theory, we are about to have a support or resistance break. This sound correct @BigCheds ? I'm new and really appreciate your teaching.
4220 2018-04-09 16:34:48 Do you even know what an ad hominem attack is? At no point did I attack you and not your words. Just keep throwing around catchy buzz words. Fake it until you make it.

4222 2018-04-09 16:34:38 when $WAN $ICX $POA or $ONT get listed, it will easy bring back the volume...., i actually think @Poloniex with the whole rebrand will beat @BittrexExchange to the punch though,and i think the Gem that will revive both of this exchanges will be ....wait for it......... $DRGN
4223 2018-04-09 16:34:27 Bro you aren’t helping the community by digging in further. I know you portray yourself like asshole and anyone else can fuck off, but really, you’re only making the situation worse and stirring the pot.

1. put the money in a private coin thrue OTC

Now a lot of ppl are aware of an allegedly cheaper faster platform that's only 4 cents right now. Creating buzz.

4293 2018-04-09 16:29:00 All my excess money that's not in some form of good is in crypto, fiat is a fucking scam and I never want to have more than what I need till next paycheck.

Besides, nobody has to know how much money I actually have.

4314 2018-04-09 16:26:35 Tiny hands make it look yuge
4315 2018-04-09 16:26:27 So, my take on crypto. More novice people are buying into crypto which is making the market more volatile. They see a little pump and sell, see a little loss and dump. This is why crypto is not going anywhere. Newbies. Just my opinion.
4316 2018-04-09 16:26:15 What’s worse, is that these negative articles that come out after scams are exposed persuade potential investors to stay away from crypto(therefore less money is in the market).

4322 2018-04-09 16:24:57 Yup, any time someone has something negative to say, it's FUD, haters, and low-sellers. I heard the same exact thing from Bitconnect and Davor supporters. We all know how that worked out.
4323 2018-04-09 16:24:56 its all about managing risk and hedge appropriately, thats why the secret change person by person according to their emotions/budget

4334 2018-04-09 16:24:13 And of course you are right that markets can't demand something they don't know (there had been no demand for iPad before it came). But perhaps more prudence (and thought) on what #crypto innovators push to the market would help. Ultimately time will tell {end}

4341 2018-04-09 16:23:52 I understand where you are coming from, Making money is always good. But “scam” (think bitconnect) are bad for all of crypto markets overall. When scams are exposed it gives the media an excuse to write negatively about crypto in general, and in doing so markets crash.
4342 2018-04-09 16:23:48 I know lot of people that would do this.

4348 2018-04-09 16:23:22 That article was written by a core team member who has the actual facts, so when reporting on a real event, actual facts are important... so yeah. I think it's more accurate than people who use the term accidental fork.
4349 2018-04-09 16:23:22 I agree
4350 2018-04-09 16:23:16 Great news ...when is the airdrop ?
4351 2018-04-09 16:23:16 no way man, realistically the only other option is to sit on the couch and watch t.v
4352 2018-04-09 16:23:15 Yeah but before paper trading you need to know what you are doing. Otherwise you are just throwing darts at a board. If you somehow come out ahead that gives you confirmation bias to dive into real trading and lose all your money because you still don't know what you're doing.
4353 2018-04-09 16:23:13 Yeah this will be another big moment in the history of crypto currencies.

4427 2018-04-09 16:16:45 Agreed - if businesses ignore the growth of mobile payments in China, they are ignoring a global market measured in the trillions.  That's just one example of many - the US needs to be crypto-friendly to keep its Silicon Valley edge.

4463 2018-04-09 16:15:07 I agree. Soft cap should make this project a go and they should close the sale.

Especially when they said they would distribute all the tokens to the investors based on their investment in the project. Everytime someone buys during the extension, redistributed tokens fade away.

4476 2018-04-09 16:13:38 Is BitFinex involved in Money Laundering and connected to drug trafficking? Several media sources are reporting this, however there has been no proof as of yet so this can all be just FUD. The truth still remains to be seen.
4477 2018-04-09 16:13:28 Did you actually read the reddit thread? The overall sentiment is that Verge is a scam. But by all means, keep drinking that Verge kool-aid. #vergescam

4518 2018-04-09 16:10:12 Yes. ICO's provide an alternative to the HUGE PAIN IN THE BUTT VC gauntlet. Another Killer app of crypto. ICO's expose the shady side of investing.. not just crypto. Once place regulation could help, Pains me to say it.
4519 2018-04-09 16:10:08 There comes a point in your life when there's a fork in the path, and it's like that with crypto. So, if you work on something consistently enough, the right path will open itself eventually.

4547 2018-04-09 16:08:03 Pretty simple - if everyone doesn’t panic and realizes it’s a planned attack against crypto then FUD won’t work. I don’t get why so many people read into everything media says. They all have agendas.

4550 2018-04-09 16:07:57 The crypto followers, they get so attached to an alt-coin or token and half of them don't know the actual use case for it, or at a minimum know very little about it.
4551 2018-04-09 16:07:51 In real life???  Are you crazy?  I heard they are all just weirdos that don't always wear clothes, only talk about corn, noodles & lambos,  and then tattoo bizarre things on their skin.

4629 2018-04-09 16:02:48 Basically its similar to credit in that, it is not physical. Some coders created a crypto code, ie, very crazy secure code, & is always getting more secure. They then made something like 6bil coins, no more or less. Purchasing coins reduces the pool, increasing value

4691 2018-04-09 15:58:58 Secret is you sell the high of the bumps during a major downtrend. Just as you would buy the dips during a major uptrend (think 2017). It doesn’t work any other way. That’s the secret if you are disciplined..

4811 2018-04-09 15:47:03 I think you could make a case here, But the IRS will probably consider it a dividend. I doubt they will allow crypto-to-crypto  trades be considered 1031 exchanges. This isn't allowed for metal-to-metal exchanges, or derivatives.  At least BTC isn't taxed as a currency.

5064 2018-04-09 15:23:12 Trump maybe, China is trying to adapt trx (tron) a Korean crypto, with China’s economy flourishing as on now, that would be a move trump will make. Trx (tron) will tower bitcoin.

5081 2018-04-09 15:21:28 Sure:

1. Verge did have an attack. Has been corrected. Not that uncommon
2. McAfee is a self-serving snake. That whole debacle was between XVGWhale and him.
3. Nobody begged for money. It was a crowd-fund campaign to integrate with a new global partner. Nothing to do with taxes

I bought a decent bag in October. 2018 will be a nice year for OMG after the bear market tide changes and Plasma makes an official announcement of a working product. OmiseGo will probably continue partnerships etc.

5111 2018-04-09 15:18:07 @vishalwrites (1) We are talking about Digital India & not recognizing importance of Cryptocurrency. Though we want to explore Blockchain Technology. (2) Can't India Government take example from Japan. (3) RBI recent announcement to banks on crypto is completely senseless.

5114 2018-04-09 15:18:03 If you hold a coin that a pump group post a shill chart of, smartest thing you can do is sell into the pump. We know for a fact that’s what inside members will be trying to do.

Not a fan of the extension but I guess it’s their call to make. Some folks are salty on Telegram about it though. I still like their product regardless.

5172 2018-04-09 15:14:00 One of the main use cases for crypto is that of decentralisation.

Decentralisation gives users more security, more control and more transparency.

And nowhere is that needed more than in crypto exchanges.
5173 2018-04-09 15:13:59 Crypto is a movement as was hip hop. In hip hop, you have the four sub genres
 -graffiti 
 -DJying
 -breakdance
 -rap

In crypto, the four sub genres are 
 -analysis
 -development
 -mining
 -trading

Each are inexorably intertwined with one another. Crypto will change the world!

5193 2018-04-09 15:11:30 Gold response.
5194 2018-04-09 15:11:26 Sudden plot twist. 1. They indeed entered. 2. Informed the public 3. Dumped (we are here) 4. Informed about "how troubled the crypto is" (might happen next) 5. Bought the final bottom. At least Soros is the player - he will be constantly testing different strategies
5195 2018-04-09 15:11:22 ... plus ada and maybe neo for third
5196 2018-04-09 15:11:15 I've been blocked by them since I got to twitter. Choe was mad because I told him he needed to use his crypto coins to buy clothes, not wear his dads.

5298 2018-04-09 15:02:29 One of the best gems out there is $TOMO

Big crypto players and influencers aren't shilling it (yet) because they are still accumulating. They want it cheaply. 

Get it before FOMO begins!

Think of Antshares (NEO) in the early days.

Only 20M in market cap.

100x ROI potential.

5456 2018-04-09 14:51:43 Do be honest I started Crypto in April of 2017 and I can't believe how happy I am with @decredproject and @LTCFoundation growth and goals. How much I learn for all of you. Because of this all I've been studying blockchain programming now to keep up with everything.

5460 2018-04-09 14:51:25 While BTC downtrend is still in tact a lot of alts are looking bullish. If you didn't step aside and into euro or dollar fiatcoins it's probably a good time to try max your BTC.

5462 2018-04-09 14:51:00 he means the market's going to tank, weak hands are going to sell their VEN positions and get burned when, from out of the ashes of the crypto market VEN value increases following mainnet. Have I seen?
5463 2018-04-09 14:51:00 Some anxiety in #crypto #trading is normal but BIG anxiety can inhibit effective trading. Many causes including: 
A) Too much open risk 
B) Too highly leveraged 
C) Trying to claw back big losses
D) #FUD 
E) #FOMO 
Sustainable trading needs a cool head.

5470 2018-04-09 14:50:44 Szanowni Państwo, podatkowe potraktowanie walut cyfrowych jak walut obcych, ewentualnie jak instrumentów finansowych (akcje np) może tylko przysporzyć wpływów budżetowych. Prosty jasny podatek dochodowy od zrealizowanych transakcji crypto-waluty fiat

5810 2018-04-09 14:22:26 Reports and calculations, even imports from crypto sites, the CURRENCY is being treated as FIAT. i.e. I bought eth with 2 BTC, software says I made a sale of $2. Your software never worked this way before, and still doesnt for tax year 2016.
5811 2018-04-09 14:22:19 thx

5813 2018-04-09 14:21:54 I hate sleeping in crypto lol
5814 2018-04-09 14:21:53 The Rockefellers, Rothschilds, Morgan’s et al already control the banks, oil, big pharma, I could go on. Yes, they are the Illuminati, the Cabal. They have Trillions of dollars. To me this does not bode well for crypto currency.

5824 2018-04-09 14:20:55 Funny watching the bulletin boards for LION - wasn’t long ago people were trying to link it to cryptocurrency and suggest it would benefit from the rises at the time. Now though they’re trying to distance it from any talk of GoldBloc being crypto (which it never truly was anyway)

5829 2018-04-09 14:20:23 But if you need to sell alts quickly you know that by the time you send and it arrives in your trex wallet it's too late, and your 4x is now a 2x. I think thats the main reason people keep their crypto in exchanges, although i get that you never truly own your crypto on an exchng

5843 2018-04-09 14:18:19 My answer would be somewhat couched in crypto and related terms and I have no understanding of your abilities in that regard. In case it needs saying: I don't wish such a system to be used for harming people. It's clear from your question you understand that is a risk
5844 2018-04-09 14:18:18 ya if trading #crypto is your biggest income you should think like what would I have paid into a dental plan at a normal job and set that aside. In theory it is actually cheaper to just personally save money then to have someone do it for you.

5848 2018-04-09 14:18:02 Januarys Lesson: Just because crypto/blockchain technology is extremely undervalued, does not mean that the market is immune to short term corrections. Particularly now that the futures market has introduced Shorts to the game. STANDARD TRADING RULES APPLY! Always.

5900 2018-04-09 14:14:25 I think OG $crypto peeps were in prior to $1k $BTC, but the true OGs remember sub $10 $BTC
5901 2018-04-09 14:14:10 We will be the first crypto-currency allowed on that exchange (not a trading platform) because of our grand mission and that we have not exposed ourselves to the wild volatility that comes from the crypto-currency trading markets.
5902 2018-04-09 14:14:04 I guess it wouldn't be very favorable to see a proof of P = NP.
Especially for our crypto community.
5903 2018-04-09 14:13:54 Didn’t know that was a crypto-related project. Both projects look dope though!
5904 2018-04-09 14:13:45 What cohort determines capitulation, obviously not those that bought at #ATH or were not in this market when #BTC was sub 3K? Does fear have to exist in those who thought they'd never see these prices again?
5905 2018-04-09 14:13:39 You just won't find anything under 500 that can handle gaming (unless you're fine with 2D and low res TF2) right now is a great time to buy high end laptops as no joke buying a laptop of the same specs as a PC costs less due to the garbage fire that is crypto. Save up imo.
5906 2018-04-09 14:13:37 China had it right by telling this old troll to “fuck off” when he tried to short the yuan. Crypto traders would be wise to do the same.

5936 2018-04-09 14:10:46 ただし、日本に関しては、内外コンソーシアムで、XRPの使用を視野に入れてる。
ここが進めば、日本国内でも銀行でXRPが使われる可能性がでてくる。

民間については、まだ使用されてはいないが、xViaを使って、xCurrentに接続することは考えられている。

5955 2018-04-09 14:09:18 アフタービットコイン見ればわかるが、そもそもXRPはSWIFTの代替。
つまり「通貨のペアリング」として使われることが前提になってる。
つまり、ILPはそもそも各国のエクスチェンジまでを想定してるから、国内は別の仕組みが必要になる。

5987 2018-04-09 14:05:27 Was it the whitepaper? I don't remember anymore it was so long ago. I think it was maybe the first roadmap they released? 

I know they had it before masternode release so that was the red flag I dumped on.

crypto currency is not a problem but it is a solution of all financial problem. Ex- thousands of  farmers attempting to suicide every year due to failure of crops . But if he invest Rs 1000 only for five years then he will get more than Rs 100,000 and save life .

6103 2018-04-09 13:56:38 Use ePayments debit card. It's not instant but you just have to exchange crypto to fiat from their app a minute before you spend, or any other time to have funds already available on your card. Works like a charm.

6170 2018-04-09 13:48:15 I see more criticism over blockchains over the time. It is absolutely nonsensical to do that based on some crypto price drop. Moreover, it is not meant to solve problems for your static website with mere 100 hits a day.

6179 2018-04-09 13:47:04 The reasons FUD are becoming so laughable, I’m shocked to see so many ppl still using this to justify/TA the price drop.
What’s even funnier, ppl on telegram keep asking themselves ‘who’s selling at these prices’

6211 2018-04-09 13:44:31 My argument is there isnt only one crypto currency which can be used in a country, therefore its only fair to ask how all these will be regulated and to which benchmark, what are variables to consider in this instance. I mean we only have the Rand as our fiat currency.
6212 2018-04-09 13:44:24 なんや！Rippleの中央集権的役割でXRPLedgerの非中央集権的役割を高めているのはわいでもわかるやで！そのためのUNLとコバルトいうんもあるんやろ！どやぁ

6223 2018-04-09 13:43:05 Same is true for blockchain/crypto technology ( i know you have your views on it), we only pay lip service to it, IMHO this is one advance which we must adopt, other than control freak China no other country has blocked it, they are only trying to tweak it to suit their needs
6224 2018-04-09 13:42:53 Where in the Constitution does Congress find the authority to regulate or censor the internet? That’s your usecase for crypto right there.

6257 2018-04-09 13:39:51 Keep in mind that cycles get a lot faster due to halving, but with every halving the impact will get lower.

Also Mt Gox made 10-20% of the entire market liquidity disappear + hedge fonds getting into crypto.

This fractal comparison looks pretty good but seems to easy.

6280 2018-04-09 13:37:20 honestly think that low-liquidity market is turning down the entire crypto market? my word
6281 2018-04-09 13:36:45 Ben alors Perrine, on a des accointances crypto fascistes? Cachotière.....
6282 2018-04-09 13:36:36 I support crypto currency in India . I kindly request the government of India and RBI don't Ban. Very things it is a future base currency.
6283 2018-04-09 13:36:22 Right sir
Govt should regulate Crypto currency but not to Ban.
6284 2018-04-09 13:36:15 So which crypto do you consider to be a sound investment?
6285 2018-04-09 13:36:11 How do I take profit from #crypto everyday? 

SET AN INVESTMENT AMOUNT. A FIRM ONE!

Short trade daily.

Sell for 15% mark up through 3rd party. 

Pay my rent with it every month, even when the market tanks.

6290 2018-04-09 13:35:48 @FinMinIndia has shown , how incompetent they are to ignore benefits of crypto currency. This is my money I earned legally and u are forcing me to use foreign exchanges. Better come with policy to regulate it rationally, rather blindly banning

6310 2018-04-09 13:34:13 Crypto is a neural network, an internet of money. A neural network is designed to circumnavigate dammaged portions. In short blockchain / crypto is meant to be independent of the financial system, survive a financial system crash and not be controlled by gate keepers. Watch TEDx

6313 2018-04-09 13:34:06 Ateş bizi çağırıyor bence 
6314 2018-04-09 13:34:02 Nice article. But I dont believe crypto will ever completely replace fiat. Its wishful thinking. The world will always find balance. Fiat system will  improve and work alongside crypto. Complete decentralization is anarchy. Centralized systems will always exist in nature.
6315 2018-04-09 13:33:46 Crypto cards like Plutus allow users to transfer cryptos to cards and auto converts to fiat currency, allowing you to spend at over 40 million merchants safely and securely, with no merchant adoption needed, giving consumer the access to spend crypto anywhere.

I'am sick of all the FUD around Ripple. The haters say that it's a bank Coin and it is centralized. 
My answer: HODL
In a few years most coins have been solved. #Ripple is here to stay.

6443 2018-04-09 13:22:42 Some of them DO sell/buy a "diversified" portfolio of "crypto" vs fiat, so there is that. But even when they sell 1 altcoin to buy another 1, there's no fundamental reason to do this or that, except sometimes marketing events, so it's random noise which cancels out on average.

6483 2018-04-09 13:18:42 The market is still immature (completely illiterate, to be precise) and it cannot assess (and thus price) stuff based on fundamentals. Thus many investors just consider "crypto" a thing (it isn't) & they "diversificate" among BTC & scamcoins as that made any sense (it doesn't).

6996 2018-04-09 12:40:24 The ultra-low liquidity in crypto is symptomatic of the first wave of the "wall of institutional money" flowing out, licking wounds from losses from the bubble IT created.

7030 2018-04-09 12:35:23 its not neccassery or him to pull the price down.The official announcment is:"Soros is into trading crypto" it doesnt mean that he has to bring price down to profit.He needs to profit from trades that all. Besides I think that when you have that type of capital you buy things OTC

7034 2018-04-09 12:34:35 When you make those types of comments it requires some level of investigation. From what I've seen I'm not convinced. The entire crypto is a gamble and so is the stock market.

But keep in mind. Bloody monday isn't over yet.

7234 2018-04-09 12:12:30 Thats because the traditional bankers never want money to flow into gold and silver. They short the prices of gold by printing fresh new free money. 
If gold bull run happens, well,  economic implosion will occur, devaluating the fiat currency.

On a TA standpoint, icx isn’t ready for a break out yet, a few more days, I have my eyes on it, chart soon
7308 2018-04-09 12:02:56 Your getting a amazing buying opportunity. You may have to hold until 2020. I am sick of holding too but it what it is. Btc is veubf manipulated and it controls the market.

7374 2018-04-09 11:59:43 That's why working within the secure enclaves on your devices (such as the TEE - Trusted Execution Environment) is so important. Quantum computing can't crack that; it's isolated from the OS of the device, and it's not just encryption.

7376 2018-04-09 11:59:20 I still think there's a lot of hodlers. They could crash this thing badly so many would sell. Right now looking at those sell orders, its high risk for them. If so, this reset could take a while.
7377 2018-04-09 11:59:05 نیمی از جمعیت شهرنشین رومانی اسم بیت کوین را شنیده اند، ۱۹ درصد از آنها با بیت کوین‌کش آشنایی دارند. این آمار در مورد اتریوم یازده درصد، لایت کوین ۱۰ درصد، و اتریوم کلاسیک ۷ درصد است.

7383 2018-04-09 11:58:37 This wonderfully discursive @NewYorker piece is about far more than #bitcoin and crypto in general, but it is about bitcoin and crypto.

7389 2018-04-09 11:57:51 well he hated my tweet and then he blocked me. says enough don’t you think.
7390 2018-04-09 11:57:47 Funny how crypto commentators are giving the ICO journal more coverage. They are gossip scum. Why retweet them? They don't cite any sources.
7391 2018-04-09 11:57:44 Store your money in traditional currency or any crypto, and @safeincom will automatically #convert and deliver funds in the merchant’s preferred way #Safein #ICO #TokenSale #Ethereum #Blockchain #bitcoin #Crypto #Altcoins
7392 2018-04-09 11:57:37 Really tough to prove they knew of the pending insolvency or were misleading investors. The reassurances were more likely only refering to protocal issues being resolved.
7393 2018-04-09 11:57:28 Who cares. Crypto twitter needs less hate
7394 2018-04-09 11:57:27 NuruCoin could not stand the heat.If you want to stand out in Crypto you must be on top of the game not playing with people's minds or wanting to make easy money!
7395 2018-04-09 11:57:22 Yes. Gonna get rekt at least 1 more time before alt season, imo.
7396 2018-04-09 11:56:49 That is almost expected with a lot of shitcoins. Tho with 1 billion market cap you need some serious $$$ to do so on exchanges. With large market caps you just do inside trading and buy up before you release the news etc. and dump on peaks.
7397 2018-04-09 11:56:46 Make one and title it off topic about your trips you are on. Or do a double some crypto. And some about that. Example where u wanted to send that guy some btc. In the future you may look back. "I gave that dude a lot of $" (the john m prediction. :)
7398 2018-04-09 11:56:36 Top-ranked business schools have hopped on the bitcoin bandwagon by  expanding their course offerings on cryptocurrencies and blockchain.
 The move to offer more crypto-related MBA classes was fueled by  growing demand from various stakeholders #onyxcoin
7399 2018-04-09 11:56:34 This is just rediculous. If any other crypto would mention CEO of a major company is joining their team, it would definitly not get deleted!
7400 2018-04-09 11:56:25 Le temps passe vite, ça fait même pas un an que je suis dans le monde des cryptos, j’ai l’impression d’avoir vu 20 millions de choses

7403 2018-04-09 11:56:07 Because this matter is nothing to do with POS its about centralisation not just ETH but ALL crypto's ...a line has to be drawn somewhere.

7405 2018-04-09 11:55:48 Think it's not a good idea
1. Securities regulations on ICO publicity
2. Manner of publicity will probably push any utility token into security
3. Non sophisticated /non qualified investors assessing startups, some with complex tech.
More harm than good for crypto. Don't do it!
7406 2018-04-09 11:55:34 "essaie de donner une définition" Ce n'est donc pas simplement un "actif". Mon argumentaire est autour du BTC, pas tout le secteur crypto. Je t'invite à revoir tes cours de grammaire. Bonne journée.

7412 2018-04-09 11:54:34 just a huge sellwall of 1000 btc on bitfinex made by a whale trying to dump for a short
7413 2018-04-09 11:54:17 Et enfin je vous invite a lire le livre de Chris Burniske « cryptoassets » qui justement essaie de donner une définition à cette nouvelle classe d’actifs

7415 2018-04-09 11:53:52 I think the ideal password for people is 9 characters+numbers randomly generated by a crypto-random generator. Just memorize it as 3 sets of 3. Easy.
7416 2018-04-09 11:53:50 I’m torn. Part of me wants to be a millionaire but part of me wants to see john mcafee eat his dick. Maybe if it goes to 1m in 2021 that would be cool

7418 2018-04-09 11:53:39 悲しいなあ。
7419 2018-04-09 11:53:28 De plus si on prend la définition la plus simple « un actif financier est un contrat ou un titre, generalement transmissible et negociable qui est susceptible de produire des gains a son detenteur ». Et la je ne vois pas en quoi les cryptos ne correspondent pas

7730 2018-04-09 11:22:48 Stop making up phrases, no one in the crypto community will ever believe such fluffed up phrases. No one cares if you are interested in people in the crypto community, what you need to care about is if the crypto community shows any interest on what you are creating.

7740 2018-04-09 11:21:07 Bitcoin is a the biggest joke ever. Its more a casino money than some fiat replacement. And if i look on twitter,  crypto twitter thinks the same, gambling, short long lol lol

7743 2018-04-09 11:20:40 We had a couple of false alarms re crypto when a calf was off colour or had a bit of s scour, the test kits are great for giving a result in ten min. First positive was 1st April but they didn’t get it bad.

7750 2018-04-09 11:19:57 The excitement of large investors moving into #crypto is warranted - but recognise there is so much progress that needs to be completed before mainstream adoption. Cryptocurrency and #blockchain have massive potentials - but the development is still very much ongoing.

7753 2018-04-09 11:19:35 I'd agree, but that's pretty much exactly how the crypto community defines a middleman. It considers investment bankers a middleman in the fundraising process. This is incorrect, the IB's in this case provide an expert service around the process of raising capital.
7754 2018-04-09 11:19:34 Also, seeing your assets go -70% in a couple months is really bad for your health, scientifically proven to be similar to having a heart attack.
So if someone is trying to prevent having a heart attack, I wouldn't consider it as "weak". Risk management is always rule #1 in life.

7980 2018-04-09 10:59:52 FINEX とか香ばしいニュースが出た時は、そのニュースの中身を個人で判断してはいけない気がする。

そのニュースの中身がファンダなのではなく、ニュースを出そうとうるやつがいるというファンダ。
その方が真実に近い気がする。

7988 2018-04-09 10:59:08 I'm not bored, I'm challenged. Working on that, and I'm there, right now. Traditional Market trading, crypto and being free has consumed me 110%, 24/7. Signed up for programming and trading courses. I might actually play music again one day, but that's far too emotional.

8002 2018-04-09 10:57:37 It looks like hording unaccounted and unaccountable cash creating parallel black economy. Banning is the best solution. Regulations means corruption and Nirav Modi like persons will have Achhe Din.
8003 2018-04-09 10:57:37 Give me some service first the I will think about that.
8004 2018-04-09 10:57:21 People hate success and prefer to swim in mediocrity all together. That's why man :)
8005 2018-04-09 10:57:19 Fuck Off.
8006 2018-04-09 10:57:10 I advise everyone to join the project who is interested in making crypto currencies! Very competent and interesting project which could and should invest to increase your income @Kora_Network
8007 2018-04-09 10:56:56 no one is talking about forcing. You are taking this to an extreme which none of the comments here suggested.
Encouraging is not forcing. What I mean is that crypto is a male dominated market and we could do with more female representation. The ratio 95%-5% is too imbalanced.
8008 2018-04-09 10:56:55 Be careful...  I think people are being played in a psyop...  billionaire money investing etc...  this is going to dump so be safe with what you invest...  I think it goes US$5000 next stop.
8009 2018-04-09 10:56:53 Interesting perspective. I agree that the price development is following an alternately exponential and consolidative pattern, also referred to as the Crypto J-Curve by @cburniske. Not sure what to think about the valuation of #Bitcoin based on active addresses though...

8380 2018-04-09 10:11:00 Homework for the day:

If you do not know what fractals are, please look them up, learn, and start applying them to your TA.

It is scary the precision of the fractals in crypto, the real trick is finding the time frame the fractal is playing out on

8400 2018-04-09 10:08:45 If they feel panic then they are not investors 

Probably some greedy people who wanted to get rich with no effort by gambling in the market but was caught by surprise. Price only reached 20k because of greed to begin with, so why be attached to it?

8426 2018-04-09 10:04:07 健全な尻には、健全な魂が宿ると言うでしょう。
8427 2018-04-09 10:03:47  sadly right. In crypto market nobody knows, it’s all hype and fud for now. Imo when real use-cases and regulation kicks in that will be XRP (and more) time to shine brighter
8428 2018-04-09 10:03:35 This is great but I think it misses a crucial component.  Databases are for storing information. Blockchain's crucial feature is timestamping. This, along with those you mention, allows for transfer of value. Enterprises in permissioned b/c often don't need to transfer value.
8429 2018-04-09 10:03:11 for beginners

- Over 3-year time horizon, putting 2% of crypto in your assets means 5%  annual return on all your wealth, with a risk-taking of -2%

- put 5% is a little less than 100% return, doubling the capital, with a risk-taking of -5%

8438 2018-04-09 10:02:01 One of the main use cases for crypto is that of decentralisation.

Decentralisation gives users more security, more control and more transparency.

And nowhere is that needed more than in crypto exchanges.

8636 2018-04-09 09:31:51 I've just set up an $aeon wallet again, just to save some funds safe and sound.

Managing risk in #trading and #investing is good but the biggest risk comes from potential hacks. That's why i keep a few ultra cold bags as a backup in case i get wiped out

8640 2018-04-09 09:31:19 If cryptocurrency is an instrument of money, why is its value "speculative"? You dont trade a Rs 1 for 2 Rs anytime, do you ? If crypto has a "speculative value", where does that value come from ? It comes from thin air. Therefore same as lottery or gambling. Its a ponzi scheme.

8661 2018-04-09 09:28:52 I have a problem calling them currency. Currencies r called currencies, because their value is indexed to the assets/wealth of a country. What inherent value does a crypto currency have? If it is converted from a real currency, then its not a currency. Its an instrument of money!
8662 2018-04-09 09:28:30 1 $NEO = 2000 $LUX, 1 billion LUX, 50% for (pre) token sale, so they want to raise about 250k $NEO? 
why the need so much funds??

8818 2018-04-09 09:05:48 It’s a bulltrap, don’t even know why people think the market is in a bull when they see green for some hours/days, odds are crypto needs big ass % gains to create enough FOMO. Right now we’re going to 6000 for sure, and I think panic will even dry the price further down.
8819 2018-04-09 09:05:46 If people are only just proclaiming #altseason now it’s safe to say they buying into pumps. It was only 4 days ago alts was dead? Does this mean they sold the dip and fomoed again?

Yes, a Bitcoin transaction is not valid in the Bitcoin 2 blockchain and vice versa due to the differences between the transaction formats and the blockchains. #Bitcoin2 #BTC2 #Crypto

We understand RBI care about our money and stable financial system and think about unemployment 
But before banning crypto please bring back the money which has taken from the banks by businessmans and run away from country.

9412 2018-04-09 07:44:08 Yes, certainly you can but 'waiting for profits to arrive' is the inconvenience, not immediate liquidity. Also, in nations (ex: India) where fiat-crypto-fiat flow is banned, direct crypto-fiat debit cards are helpful to bypass national banks and avail liquidity.

9416 2018-04-09 07:43:21 You don't have to convert the money to FIAT, transfer it from an exchange to a bank account and then spend it. With a Crypto debit card, you just load your wallet with said currency and you're good to go. I know this because I used the TenX beta back in July last year.

9639 2018-04-09 07:08:05 Dear @RBI if you spend 1 hour properly on the internet, you'll find unlimited people in India doing cash deals for crypto. Each one of them can dole out minimum Rs 100 crore cash. Instead of going after such people, you want us the tax paying ones to suffer?

9642 2018-04-09 07:07:42 @ishookinc Q & A: What makes iShook the ideal crypto platform? simply the potential of user growth, more people use tokens the greater the validation of crypto currencies and tokens.
9643 2018-04-09 07:07:14 Also, 9 Trillion wouldn't go into BTC only. I'd see a $9T crypto market cap being split a good 50/50 amongst alts. A $200k BTC would be nice. But climbing that high in 2 years would result in a 5 year bear market zZz nobody wants that.

9892 2018-04-09 06:26:18 XRP is a digital asset.Not a crypto currency. it is decentralized . XRP can't be manipulated, it can be used for the purpose we desire. Oh, and nothing too too bad with our money system, except that it is a bit slow from times to times. Don't kill all the bankers please.

9913 2018-04-09 06:23:45 90% of people involved in Crypto are barely scratching the surface of the tech (day trading) or are re-invent the wheel/searching for a problem to apply their solution. the most common 'criticism' of crypto should not be the first problem to solve (face-to-face retail purchases).
9914 2018-04-09 06:23:35 the flip side though is that without it interest rates can never be positive, even with a 0 default rate, at least in nominal terms. tho in my crypto-utopia fantasy communities can implement collectivism as shitcoins pegged to bitcoin, seems inflationary but really just demurrage
