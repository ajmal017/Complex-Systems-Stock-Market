31 2018-02-10 20:26:24 Globitex ICO, I'm in. Looks, decent to me. Next ones that I'm waiting for are, current and signals. 

"Globitex introduces a digital currency exchange allowing everyone to trade commodities and money market instruments for Bitcoin."
32 2018-02-10 20:16:30 Labels_ they're based used on commodities, not people.
33 2018-02-10 19:59:36 Insisto, creer que alguien no quiera crecer es ridículo, puesto a que sin crecimiento no hay recaudación. Ve las cifras que mostré, ve cómo ha caido el crecimiento a nivel regional. Simplemente eso pasa por depender de las commodities. Tercer imacec alto, por el mismo caso.
34 2018-02-10 19:56:57 No we’re basically is the same spot we’ve always been in, under achieving potential at one spot, aged veteran at another spot, undersized slot/Nickel/3rdCB with basically unknown commodities after that, that’s essentially what we’ve had since it was IKE and Deshea, the names
35 2018-02-10 19:53:58 Lo de dominga fue un caso puntual, pero no el que ejempifica el bajo crecimiento. De todos modos, también se comprueba que es un país dependiente de las commodities y su producción, por lo que un bajon en el precio implica baja en el crecimiento del país.
36 2018-02-10 19:50:48 El gráfico comprueba lo que digo: Latinoamérica creción menos en promedio que en épocas pasadas. Crecimiento 2011 (mejor momento de las commodities):
Panamá 11,8%
Ecuador: 7,9%
Colombia: 6,6%
Perú: 6,3%
Chile: 6,1%
Argentina: 6%
Uruguay: 5,2%

Todos tuvieron bajones gigantescos.

39 2018-02-10 19:37:11 Nuevamente estás hablando cualquier cosa. Hablé en el comentario anterior que el crecimiento fue bajo, pero debido a la baja del precio de las commodities. Ya llevamos un tercer Imacec con alto crecimiento, supongo que para algunos especímenes eso es "efecto Piñera".
40 2018-02-10 19:36:48 @allstarcharts Commodities and precious metals hit hard during this correction.  A sign of things to come?  Tech and financials have sold off the least.  USD rebound pending?  
41 2018-02-10 19:35:17 @CiovaccoCapital It’s also interesting that energy and oil have sold off hard during the recent correction.  Tech & financials have sold off the least.  I’m not seeing commodities (& related) lead like 2002-08.  Your thoughts?
42 2018-02-10 19:33:59 Fry bread and beans and rice. A family favorite that comes from my grandma living on commodities on the reservation.
43 2018-02-10 19:31:52 *CONFLICT* there will be crypto securities and commodities as your tweet implies. Through openly evading taxation & bypassing sanctions, crypto as a currency in retail markets will not make it. On black markets it will still be a currency. Thus commodity vs currency conflict.
44 2018-02-10 19:15:29 breakfast in bed is one of the best commodities.
45 2018-02-10 19:07:27 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
46 2018-02-10 18:46:06 If U.S. Dollar rallies, then most currencies will fall and hurt commodities. Then were does #riskparity #allweather go? Cash or short?
47 2018-02-10 18:43:53 My Current Focus with Crypto is finding Trade tokens Built to simplify international trade by a country so they can digitize their international trade Commodities.  Simply put CryptoCurrency backed by a Country's exportable commodities.  i.e. Oil, Diamonds, Natural Gas etc.

49 2018-02-10 18:42:43 You thought that tax breaks would drop the price of world commodities?
50 2018-02-10 18:40:47 There seems to be a problem even their stock is dwindling. It’s as if they have shifted focus to provision of basic commodities only. I think there’s a problem in retail.
51 2018-02-10 18:39:37 I think passion is one of the most precious commodities we possess. It drives us, sustains us, gives us a sense of purpose. Whatever it is that we are passionate about, with hard work, determination, vision, and passion our dreams will be achieved.
52 2018-02-10 18:36:18 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.
53 2018-02-10 18:32:20 Just participated in my second ico, @globitex_ . With all this institutional money coming in, Globitex is going to revolutionize the way exchanges are run. They are going to introduce commodities trading which is just amazing. I’m so stoked for this project! $gbx

56 2018-02-10 18:19:00 Avocado, sugarcane and bananas are smuggled from Kisii to marikiti everyday. Higher taxes should be levied on these commodities before they leave Kisii
57 2018-02-10 18:10:53 And what is the problem with that? Bargain hunting is financially prudent when commodities are over-priced.
58 2018-02-10 18:10:28 Thanks, but I’m no bot!  I’ve just spent some time studying & living in Russia & the former Soviet Union, one of our major US adversaries. Like it or not, we’ve got to live with Russia, whose major export commodities are conspiracy, blackmail, dissension, discord and espionage.

60 2018-02-10 17:59:09 Remember, th USA wasn't th only ones represented. There were 6 countries voting for or against Putin buying a stake of Uranium One. Is Russia dominating in Nuclear Energy? Go to th history. Doesn't Putin hate Obama & HRC. What ws th vote like? Commodities market is Greedy.
61 2018-02-10 17:43:02 There is nothing Trump does that doesn’t advance his financial goals or pave the way for his financial goals. Our country, it’s security, it’s people, it’s commodities, it’s land and democracy are all just pawns for Trump to play for money and power.

63 2018-02-10 17:21:37 So on the commodities market, prices drop when the market is already saturated. I think all this shows is that there's already excessive amounts of information out there about what you're really doing. #tictoctictoc

66 2018-02-10 17:14:01 Insensitive because paying for people is treating them as commodities. People who made money on owning slaves should not get even more money from the govt that future generations have to pay off..

68 2018-02-10 16:35:36 Gotta be a way, but I'm unfamiliar with the bond market.... and the stock market, commodities market.... derivatives market. Let's face it, I'm no help at all.
69 2018-02-10 16:35:13 How to turn a healthy equities sell-off into a rout, increase interest rates and trigger more poorly sold derivatives than anyone can imagine.....sparking yet another broadbased sell-off in equities, bonds, commodities.  Ultimately a vastly weaker economy.  Well done @GOP !
70 2018-02-10 16:34:38 U people will do only this or will take action against increasing price of essential commodities, petrol and unemployment .when u will arrest currupt congressi. Only drama.
71 2018-02-10 16:30:25 The sale and purchase of counterfeited and adulterated commodities when the purchaser is unaware of its state, like selling milk mixed with water or oil mixed with fat or something else. This action is called cheating
#StopSellingHaram
72 2018-02-10 16:28:34 This is not surprising. Trump will stand by these abusers till the end of time. Such men consider women, minorities & any1 who is weak & feeble as commodities; cattle on farmland. How difficult is it 2 say a few words of empathy for the women abused at the hands of his staffers?
73 2018-02-10 16:22:59 While there may be a strong 6 month rebound it seems the broader multi+year trend is own assets that benefit from reflation (commodities, companies that can pass off inflation to clients, short term bonds as dry powder shld risk reprice due to hawkish central banks)
74 2018-02-10 16:17:36 El consumo está en el mismo nivel los últimos 6 años. Estamos estancados desde que colapsaron los precios de los commodities y se desnudó la realidad. Queremos mantener este consumo exportando menos.

79 2018-02-10 15:14:28 Will the effect of a massive drop be inflationary or deflationary for consumer prices? I imagine inflationary for commodities, especially precious metals, although one never knows for sure.

121 2018-02-10 07:19:29 It isn't. The EU conforms to WTO tariffs outside of its own market so we know the minimum and maximum rates. The CET makes the internal market more expensive in many commodities, the removal of which to free competitive trade will make many goods cheaper

133 2018-02-10 05:09:57 Yessir. But, too is an under-educated population that are (to my mind) criminally misinformed. Every nation needs an information resource that meets a basic standard. Pure capitalism - in which people end up as commodities - does not serve the public interest in media either.
134 2018-02-10 05:09:56 can we stop treating pagans/wiccans/witches as fucken commodities for your videos to make fun of and be disrespectful as shit toward
135 2018-02-10 05:07:49 Las fallas del mercado argentino nada tienen que ver con este gobierno. Lo que falla es el sistema de vender commodities y no productos terminados que generan más valor.  Sin embargo me gustaría escuchar tu opinión respecto a las externalidades, como pueden afectar al precio...

137 2018-02-10 04:57:13 What “continued mining boom”? Commodities were in deep depression for 9 of Howard6666’s years. Boom didn’t occur until 2010.
138 2018-02-10 04:53:40 Essential Commodities Act and Agricultural Land Ceiling Act are hardal for agro-sector.

140 2018-02-10 04:52:11 Drugs muddle up your self-understanding, you become a mushroom suckling on capitalist commodities.
141 2018-02-10 04:49:17 A woman who cannot afford medical care for her child is not empowered by adoption. Or one who is pressured by family or a religious community. 

Adding money into adoption is the opposite way to go if you want to empower women & stop turning them & their children into commodities
142 2018-02-10 04:40:37 If fiat is gone what would we use as a base currency for commodities exchanges and oil? The spastic crypto would murder oil trading. 
143 2018-02-10 04:22:25 If our Govt succeed to persuade our talented people to get job and  subsequently migrate in other countries in a dignified way, it will be beneficial economically, politically, spreading our culture and religion, exporting our commodities and in many other ways in long run.
144 2018-02-10 04:20:12 Apart from crypto this so called "healthy correction " has spread in all other asset classes and commodities unlike the past ,in this phase correction is sharing high levels of correlation with stocks and bonds.
145 2018-02-10 04:20:03 Gold and silver, like other commodities, have an intrinsic value, which is not arbitrary, but is dependent on their scarcity.
146 2018-02-10 04:07:34 economic growth turned economic worst what happened? what the admin will do to help us fight this new enemy of the state (high prizes) of basic commodities) created by this butcher ang his bunches of useless animals in the government
147 2018-02-10 04:00:08 The economy was only doing well because the business cycle was in boom and foreigners were buying up our commodities.
A govt surplus is transfer of dollars from the economy to the govt. 
9 years of draining dollars out of the economy then the GFC  oops youve left that part out
148 2018-02-10 03:52:54 Friendly reminder: don't invest in commodities.
149 2018-02-10 03:49:24 GOD BLESS AMERICA  Trump says  why would he or why should he  you invade  pillage their resources and commodities  leave thousands displaced  the country left in rubble  so why would GOD bless you ? 
150 2018-02-10 03:44:56 We could have bought commodities when they were butchers in very recent time. But then most of our leaders are bookish. Out of the box, is out of capabilities!
151 2018-02-10 03:43:09 I think so. Can explore (not sure how far, though). Looks like there are some missions but haven't tried yet. Can buy and sell some commodities, so perhaps trade. Not sure about buying ships. Still a lot I need to figure out. It's not really as simple as ED.
152 2018-02-10 03:36:43 Chinese buying of our commodities saved us from the GFC! Best treasurer in the world? what's next Kim Jong Un winning the nobel peace prize??

154 2018-02-10 03:22:11 This Messenger was a brutal war Lord, sex pervert, rapists, distributed captured women among war booty & traded women as Commodities. Shame.

166 2018-02-10 01:29:07 It’s only going to get worse due to the brexiteers with no brain in their head to see a pound collapse due to uncertainty that will rise the price of commodities so we won’t be able to afford much more in the future

169 2018-02-10 00:53:12 Data's always scarce, but my sense is the big drivers were newcomers to crypto. They were a mix of curious small money retail investors (who may or may not own stocks, commodities, etc.) and bigger money professionals (emboldened by the CME/CBOT futures play)
170 2018-02-10 00:46:11 Well, that’s a very one sided view. Yes, I’m a Brexiteer. That’s a personal stance. Some of my friends voted Remain. No big deal. I’m a ‘personal’ commodities trader...I trade for myself.  Not sure how that’s a bad thing.

173 2018-02-10 00:37:27 I can’t fathom school as a profit driven enterprise. Education/degrees are already treated like commodities. Isn’t this model an example of what went wrong with private colleges in NSW?

176 2018-02-10 00:25:31 Commodities are not shares either. All cryptocurrencies are speculative because you are assuming certain growth will eventuate in the future such that you can discount that future back to a PV. XRP's value is sourced in potential future utility in international settlement.

242 2018-02-11 18:38:16 It leaks into all paper assets. Commodities these days are pretty much held in paper form. US and Euro bond yields can only rise so much before consumers and corporations tap out. There's too much debt overhang along with structural demographic headwinds.

259 2018-02-11 17:06:48 What she means is, there's a distinction between care & control. Care is loving. Control is objectifying. Children are not objects to be fixed. That distinction is an important one in a society that often views children as property & adults as commodities.

265 2018-02-11 16:46:49 I really love these. Sometimes it’s exactly what you think, but other times when you think you know what it’s going to look like it can completely surprise you. I guess the bearish fundamentals are worried about inflation, bearish stocks bullish commodities
266 2018-02-11 16:44:31 Samuel Delany: "In what you've asked, I can detect the possibility of a naive assumption that the redistribution of commodities is somehow congruent with the redistribution of wealth – which it is not."
267 2018-02-11 16:41:36 I guess, that rising yields in US forerun escape from USD (not from equities) to equities, commodities and €. Therefore, particularly EM shall benefit from EURUSD hitting record high levels within a few years.
268 2018-02-11 16:41:01 I’m with ya, but the only true way to make consumer understand who hold the cards is to call the bluff of “we won’t buy it”, that’s the only way I can see to truly elevate the value of all commodities, which themselves aren’t scarce, but the number of people who CAN do it are...

274 2018-02-11 15:21:18 Interesting read.  I didn’t realize copper featured so prominently in the Green world. A number of the people I follow on FinTwit are talking about commodities generally being a good investment.  Seems counterintuitive at the end of a business cycle. But that’s why I read...

278 2018-02-11 14:59:34 ...like the dot-com, the housing, South Sea bubbles, stock or commodities bubbles? None were caused by governments.l, all fueled by over zealous investors. Japan’s bubble is the only one I know of. Where’s your evidence that governments caused bubbles?
279 2018-02-11 14:59:11 Yeah our country turns basic human needs into commodities, very sad indeed
280 2018-02-11 14:52:43 Govt should never adopt a policy to make essential commodities  costly for middle class  and free for  lower  economic group . Its an extra burden on middle class.  Relief should be given to middle class.
281 2018-02-11 14:39:37 Having a much better time charting today, although equities are a lot easier to predict, than commodities, or currency markets.
282 2018-02-11 14:38:44 Not gonna post NZD charts, but just want to be clear here. Currencies are speaking volumes... If your trading commodities and were short from the tops like I was, the RISK is that we get a bounce soon. Inflationary currencies look ready to dead-cat-bounce here before lower....
283 2018-02-11 14:26:31 @cspanwj Many Americans don't understand that investing is something you have to watch like a hawk.  You should never assume anything when it comes to stocks, bonds and commodities.
284 2018-02-11 14:21:22 I’m saying that I’m going to produce commodities the right way, if you don’t like that, I encourage you to not buy mine & go grow your own, that’s capitalism... it’s not always about the consumer being right, they simply don’t know how to do my job & I won’t entertain nonsense

287 2018-02-11 14:14:56 If you read the article, it's not a blanket comparison. I compare a few specific tokens that deal with retail facing commodities to Enron's commoditization of those same assets. I then outline the challenges Enron faced and purport that those are exacerbated by retail investors

291 2018-02-11 13:44:55 No worries... the increased costs of goods and commodities like gas and foods will erase that and more. And, as an added bonus, it ends soon, but not for corporate America. The rich just keep getting richer... #SAD4USA

293 2018-02-11 13:34:56 General Mills, the foods company recently released a set of sustainable sourcing commitments undertaken in partnership with a third party. This approach led the company to prioritise ten commodities, including oats, wheat and corn, that they plan to source sustainably. #MG334
294 2018-02-11 13:27:36 One cannot 'have' time Sean. So, it's the most precious of commodities. 'Things' are decorations and no more than that. Life, love, health...Those are truly wondrous.
295 2018-02-11 13:15:12 As I said where there are liabilities there are assets both must be taken into account ,UK owns property rights in the EU  & has a claim on many commodities win cellar art work etc, all these things are taken into account on any legal payment oweing which is nil. EU owes UK .
296 2018-02-11 13:10:39 O Brasil é o País mais fácil de resolver. Ex: Se investíssemos no beneficiamento de nossos commodities, como ferro Guza, milho, soja, trigo dentre outros; geraríamos milhões de empregos no Brasil. Porque hoje estes produtos saem daqui e geram empregos em outros países.
297 2018-02-11 13:06:55 O Brasil é o País mais fácil de resolver. Ex: Se nos fabricássemos nossos Navios de transporte para transportar nossas commodities faríamos ficar no Brasil mais de 120bilhões de reais por ano que pagamos a estrangeiros para transportar. Fora mais de 60.000 empregos diretos.
298 2018-02-11 13:01:51 Chinese demand for our agricultural commodities is insatiable, right?   Latest musings coming out of China regarding anti-dumping investigations from China's Ministry of Commerce into US sorghum. Sorghum is one thing, but if it extends to US soybeans, the hurt gets real.

321 2018-02-11 08:05:01 I'm curious whether the dollar holds next week. If equities and the dollar selloff together, commodities are the perceived safety-play. It would be nice if BTC fell into this safely zone that commodities occupy.

417 2018-02-09 21:53:48 Exactly. In 2015, NL econ humming along but big challenges with govt fiscal. Oil & other commodities dropped precipitously & govt spending still high. Led to $billion+ deficit. PCs plan designed to address it while recognizing fundamental strength of NL econ. Voters didn't agree.

425 2018-02-09 21:23:34 Curious... what provides you with the confidence that it’s predominantly inflation related when since the sell-off TIPS underperformed Treasuries, commodities were negative, and breakeven inflation moved lower through yesterday’s close?
426 2018-02-09 21:11:06 Define "respectful," and explain how displaying scantily clad women encourages reproduction. If anything, by reducing women to commodities, it turns them into non-reproductive objects.
427 2018-02-09 21:10:41 Fair. Still, in my experience there have been times imo where ICOs were uncorrelated to macro, and where gold & commodities traded inverse to USD, i.e. as risk-on assets.
428 2018-02-09 21:08:56 But we still aren’t in a bear market as that’s defined by 20% off highs.  But the other side of his call was long commodities which have gotten crushed.

503 2018-02-09 16:53:29 Men don't think at all. Men don't raise their sons NOT to think that girls are commodities, something to put a little color in their lives, a little beauty in their crazy world... We are not things to complement men's lives, we are not helpers, little extras. We are women.
504 2018-02-09 16:52:07 I suspect @Sarge986 any of us, myself included, that focus upon commodities will need to make good use of your 'post it note' suggestion recently of covering asset value during this market vomit.

This will pass but certainly a test of where is the bottom.

511 2018-02-09 16:19:19 Current clearing px of commodities is set by a nation w/Liabs 30x revs, that hasn't run a surplus in 20 yrs, isn't biggest comm buyer anymore, who was cut off by CBs 3+ yrs ago, & who's losing monopoly of commodity pricing.  World's changing, most still playing by the old rules.
512 2018-02-09 16:17:45 That's what I suspected. This sounds like China's black market banking which led to many a bankruptcy, such as when a company used commodities (bought on borrowed money no less) on a factory floor as collateral for new loans. Here, it's securities as collateral for money loans.
513 2018-02-09 16:14:50 Bem, não ouvi nada a respeito ... mas tbem nao fui atrás. Tá feio mesmo ... todavia, parece fazer sentido. A pergunta é se o ciclo positivos das commodities é força suficiente para melhorar os resultados. Tá feio lá. Alavancagem

516 2018-02-09 16:09:50 As a suggestion all those against WTO rules should do some research. As someone who has for the last 20+ years been involoved in the import and export of various commodities, WTO is better suited to trade growth than a single market customs union.
517 2018-02-09 16:09:10 Spoke at a CFA conference last night & was asked which real assets/commodities, other than phys gold, offered effective insurance. On reflection, nothing else comes close. Gold wasn't "issued" or "appointed" by anyone to be what it is; it emerged through natural market selection
518 2018-02-09 16:06:22 Could not agree more. Mined cryptocurrencies that are native protocol-linked commodities will blow them away on average based on better supply and demand.

520 2018-02-09 16:03:42 Might be a good time to buy #gold and other precious metals. Commodities could see a nice boost as we shift back (did we really ever leave) to dovish language.
521 2018-02-09 16:00:55 Amazing how often they get conflated. We make the same mistake when we refer to public health supply chains, which in reality distribute health commodities for the entire public sector (and often to private also) healthcare system, beyond "public health" including for cancer etc.
522 2018-02-09 15:57:01 If rates are going up, why are commodities expected to go up?
523 2018-02-09 15:49:59 not sure what he means by "tight gas via LNG" since both commodities are represented in the gas category & emissions intensity of tight gas appears relatively low. Unless you're using LNG to extract tight gas?

589 2018-02-09 11:53:08 Reasonable observation - thank you. I think the Fed was intended for manageable blow-up the bubble in equities but it is not keen to induce a major crash. For that reason, crashes in commodities are abrupt but in stocks "Fed put" restrains the fall.

604 2018-02-09 10:33:21 Some comments state that the sell off happened due to inflation and rates hike concerns. But why commodities are also selling off in that case?
Markets are afraid of a recession
605 2018-02-09 10:20:26 If its bad enough they have to sell whatever they can to cover margin, if the equities/swaps, etc are imploding, commodities will be the most liquid thing in their balance sheets in the short term.

623 2018-02-09 08:47:40 Higher bond yields also mean higher inflation expectation. Investors demand higher yields to compensate higher inflation. Bullish for commodities #elliottwave
624 2018-02-09 08:46:19 Mnangagwa and Mugabe makes no difference.  His visit makes no difference to Zimbabweans. Zimbabwe needs a new overhaul on its government not replacement of dead wood. Prices of basic commodities have gone up by 300% and there is no cash. 100 days in office and nothing to show for

637 2018-02-09 07:52:16 Indeed,  commodities have remained relatively stable, suggesting limited concerns about the growth outlook. Thus, it seems like the most recent selloff has been driven more by market technicals and stretched positioning while concerns about economic fundamentals remain limited.

645 2018-02-09 07:11:05 the fandom culture wherein "fans" consider actors as commodities is honestly so toxic it's sickening.
646 2018-02-09 07:06:09 Drugs do not relax you, they turn you into a consumptive addict who relies on commodities to remain socially functional.
647 2018-02-09 06:58:15 So a LOT of money has left the stock and bond markets recently, money doesn't go to money heaven. So I ask, where is it going next? Back where it came from? Into commodities? into metals? into $BTC?
648 2018-02-09 06:50:17 You make money from their deaths, from selling them on as body parts. They're not commodities they are living beings. I see animals as equals. You see them as property.
649 2018-02-09 06:46:26 Govt is controlling prices of all agro commodities which are part of index mostly to the determinant of farmer. During bumer harvest none to buy, but during lean season, govt caps exports, allows liberal imports. Except rice, wheat, dal   Govt should leave others to market.

651 2018-02-09 06:42:01 Until someone we know personally gets ‘tokhanged’ or when we realize that the prices of basic commodities eat up a big chunk of our household budget.. that’s when we start to care & speak out..when it is too late
652 2018-02-09 06:41:47 this is very true. Treated like commodities.
653 2018-02-09 06:21:13 Common sense and logic are such rare commodities in Maldives..!
654 2018-02-09 06:11:18 You could also start layering into a long term short with industries in decline such as cable companies. Commodities / miners are generationally cheap as well, noting the perceived correlation to $BTC

660 2018-02-09 05:28:36 @Narendramodi_PM Figures for commodities are mentioned in MILLIONS, meaning COMMA after every three digits.  Figures in Rupees are mentioned in Rs. Lakhs and Rs. Crores, meaning, Comma after every two digits beyond 1000.
One Million = Ten Lakhs
Ten Million = One Crore. Be careful
661 2018-02-09 05:21:00 Can’t  help but feel as long as women are not granted equal rights under the constitution we will continue to be treated like property, disposable commodities and objects that exist only to serve at the pleasure of the patriarchy.  #ERANOW

665 2018-02-09 04:05:42 Oil a little different as so many banks do the puts fpr producers - equities very different from #commodities and #forex - #oil and #natgas also have the seasonality factor
666 2018-02-09 04:03:13 I’m not a fan of commodities but I’ll trade them if they trend nicely.
667 2018-02-09 03:38:20 Probably true.

You've also been in this long enough to hedge your 'investments' in crypto, I hope.

Stories I'm hearing of people plunging in really scare me, as the fallout might end up affecting the stock, debt and commodities markets.
668 2018-02-09 03:31:16 Perhaps it's your commodities-trading background--you're biased to be trend-following and not look ahead too much.  But equities look ahead.
669 2018-02-09 03:22:23 What if stock markets, commodities, and funds around the world are crashing because everyone is pulling out to BTFD in #Bitcoin? 

Interesting thing to think about.
670 2018-02-09 03:20:49 It's a worldview that sees women as commodities, valued for their looks and/or connections, expendable when they become old, difficult or unattractive.

674 2018-02-09 02:40:38 When you see #Jimrogers, #Georgesoros , #Marcfaber on TV dont panic they are always bearish on equities & bullish on commodities from 2 decades.
If you want to check history, u can, #Bullmarket rally always happens on higher commodities , interest as optimisim is very very high
675 2018-02-09 02:25:22 That's actually a poor way to evaluate future spending priorities. State funds should be prioritised on public commodities. If a football club is considered a public commodity, hence why there has been a lack of effort or need to corporatise/privatise.

678 2018-02-09 02:17:12 Yeah not shocked. Players are treated like commodities.
679 2018-02-09 02:09:44 Thanks for the re-tweet, btw. Crappy, overpriced commodities are what the stock market is all about. Centralization is a hallmark of the worst practices of the right. You would know that, right? And from your feed you're An-Cap, right? Dude, layoff the shitty logic of Molyneux.
680 2018-02-09 02:03:53 One thing I know about making a small fortune in the commodities market... and all markets for that matter... start with a large fortune.
681 2018-02-09 01:45:51 One point no one is even considering. Yeah, it’s a lot of money to dish out. However think of all the money coming in from other countries paying what they owe, purchasing oil, gas other commodities. Billions $$$$
682 2018-02-09 01:45:39 People being socialized into a patriarchal or racially hierarchical culture does not justify sexism or racism. Being socialized into a society that views animals as commodities does not make speciesism ethically justifiable.
683 2018-02-09 01:33:09 Sahih Bukhari (58:125) - Women are tradable commodities. A Muslim with two wives offers a fellow Muslim his pick between the two. Muhammad then arranges a wedding banquet.

or are massage therapists also "turned into commodities"
685 2018-02-09 01:27:10 Don’t act like this isn’t a big deal. The Vikings lost a great offensive mind . However they have replaced him with one of the hottest coaching commodities in football. Flip in my eyes should’ve landed a HC position this offseason. Reminds me so much of when Gase took the OC job
686 2018-02-09 01:21:38 Yup. We are all commodities
687 2018-02-09 01:13:08 From the idiocy I saw the other night anyone who bows at the altar of Obama the racist Jew hater truth & lies are interchangeable commodities. You have no concept of truth. For your gang, verification is just a ploy, not the evidence of the truth.

693 2018-02-09 00:47:03 you're right about phones being commodities but there are some devices that are unique. Android in particular has a modding community with custom ROMs which allow you to unlock your phones potential or at least live in the bleeding edge in terms of software.

699 2018-02-09 00:20:43 I think the answer is fairly obvious to people who have been paying attention to moves made over the last year: the Trump administration doesn’t see women as people, but as commodities.
700 2018-02-09 00:20:04 He is right- but we have to have 3-4 big draw downs to rotate money out of stocks that outperform is low interest rate environment to those in higher int rate environment ie miners pm commodities
701 2018-02-09 00:16:20 The mantra by wall street economists so far has been, that the global economy is firing on all cylinders, and there is synchronised growth. Even Europe is growing. Lets see how that plays out. Commodities are starting to fall, and a close eye needs to be kept on this.
702 2018-02-09 00:15:31 I will be expanding on my presentation @MinesAndMoney America’s 2017 on OBOR & the impact on mining commodities
703 2018-02-09 00:11:36 You see how they talk about us? Women only view us as objects, commodities to be used, shared, and then discarded
704 2018-02-09 00:05:44 Reduced tax on the take home income. However, it resulted to increase in the day to day expenses of a family due to increase in prices of basic commodities like food. Most of the families here live on a day to day basis.
