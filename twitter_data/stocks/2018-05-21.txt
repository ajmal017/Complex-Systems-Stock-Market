Automatic, yes. She said "assault" weapons. Universal checks on "commercial" purchases; need is universal background checks for ALL purchases. And NRA doesn't promote bump stocks, but many resonsible gun owners (some in NRA) support it.
12 2018-05-21 23:48:23 CAP just released a hybrid plan that looks really feasible to me. My problems with M4A : 
1) Republican control of my healthcare. 
2) 1 million workers employed by healthcare companies
3) many pensions are tied to healthcare stocks
4) funding
There are more. But these are my top
13 2018-05-21 23:47:29 I've had a particularly brutal day today. Most of my stocks are in a sea of red, and I have the blues. Maybe it's all this rain in Florida. I'm sure tomorrow will be a better day. I'm happy you're rid of them. I hate that company with a passion.

19 2018-05-21 23:41:14 I agree 2 ban bump stocks. I also know if an evil mind wants to do harm they will, like the bombs they found. You will not stop violence by punishing the innocent law abiding citizens. & they do not have to take that punishment! It is against the law to take guns away from them.

41 2018-05-21 23:39:14 Stocks jumped not because of news but because of bonds. The new is false information. The reason for the sudden jump in stock prices was because the bond yeild dropped %3. Understand that the news is a coverup. Follow you technicals and understand the market. #stocksandbonds
42 2018-05-21 23:38:36 Are you Chinese? Why so many Chinese stocks.
43 2018-05-21 23:38:18 Cancel your Netflix account. We're not gonna have them throw the lying Obama's at us. How dare them!  Sell Netflix stocks before it tanks due to cancellations.
44 2018-05-21 23:37:14 Do you know how long guns have existed? You cant magically vanish all of the guns that have ever been made. First people complain about bump stocks and now people complaining about guns in general like make up ya mind. Guns dont kill people. People kill people
45 2018-05-21 23:36:52 You are so irrelevant Maria.  Full stop. And now, dumb for your misinformed comments.  Time to peddle penny stocks eh?
46 2018-05-21 23:36:25 #NdPr heavy #RareEarth stocks. Eg: 
$LYC - producer, $ARU late stage explorer in DFS, $MNB greenfields but bastnasite hosted deposit (ideal).
All RE stocks have their challenges as they are tough deposits, best way to accumulate is dollar cost average over 12-24 months IMO.
47 2018-05-21 23:35:52 i can’t with the fake friends.
48 2018-05-21 23:35:22 Alerts= setting notifications around key levels in stocks. Pop ups and send to email so you dont miss

50 2018-05-21 23:34:21 I lot of us understand compound interest but resent having to invest our money in overvalued stocks manipulated by well-connected east-coast frat boys just to keep up with inflation...
51 2018-05-21 23:34:11 I usually disagree with your hypocrisy, but I fully agree with you on assault weapon ban. No one under the age of 55 and with an unblemished record for 20 years should be allowed to buy an assault weapon. Make bump stocks illegal and punishable with 20 years jail time.
52 2018-05-21 23:32:16 U have lost your ever loving mind. U really need to get a consultant that knows what they are talking about because u clearly don’t. Bump stocks? Really? Back to that 1? How about holding kids acctble when they screw up, punish them so they know right from wrong. U r insane

56 2018-05-21 23:26:58 I got a Christmas check from my grandparents and was into the idea of learning about stocks. Lesson learned!
57 2018-05-21 23:26:30 5 years in crypto is like 50 years in stocks, no one can know for sure what'll happen, there are too many factors to consider. However diversification and a good strategy will assure you great profits no matter the outcome in 5 years as long as the whole crypto market is bullish.
58 2018-05-21 23:25:35 The administration will be gone when you get your friends to vote them out. In the mean time nothing is going to happen. So sit back and enjoy lower taxes, higher stocks and lower unemployment.

62 2018-05-21 23:22:19 @OccupyWisdom The issue is we have precedent for debt fueled growth. Japan has been doing this since what 1990? The government is the largest owner of JGB and stocks. Isn't it possible US can follow Japan's path for  forseeable future and prop up the market through QE episode 2?
63 2018-05-21 23:22:16 Would be a struggle to perform a similar logistical feat. I doubt the UK has access Wartime Reserve Stocks remotely similar to those in '82.

66 2018-05-21 23:19:20 We need common sense gun laws..
Bans a Bump stocks in EVERY STATE.
Mandatory training and permits for semi automatic weapons in EVERY STATE.
Mentally challenged kids should have NO GUNS in home, even belonging to siblings or Parents.
Better secuity in schools!.
And NO NRA IN GOV.

68 2018-05-21 23:18:58 Don't play the penny stocks.
69 2018-05-21 23:18:40 Don't need to... My ideas will stop AR's and AK's PLUS not be reduced in their duties - should the NRA donate $100,000,000,000,000 to each member... the last mass shooting did not even use a gun that supported Bump Stocks... at ALL! Shotgun and revolver - Bump Stock for ?
70 2018-05-21 23:18:20 Every time there’s a mass shooting, the only ideas the left seems to be able to present involverestrictive laws (bans) on assault weapons, high capacity mags, bump stocks, etc.

Perfect example of how simplistic and devoid of real ideas political discourse in America has become.
71 2018-05-21 23:16:33 Perfect first inning for Grace starter Todd Stocks here in the MDCC Championship game. Scoreless going to the bottom half of the 1st.
72 2018-05-21 23:15:38 Universal background checks, waiting periods, age restrictions (over 18 at least), a civilian ban on assault rifles, AR-15s, etc., however you define them. Ban on bump stocks and online tactical gear purchases. Close gun show loophole. That has been my "real answer" from day 1.
73 2018-05-21 23:15:37 I would setup an @coinbase IRA right now if I could do 10% crypto 90% stocks.
74 2018-05-21 23:15:22 He meant that he’s full of bullshit; and stocks.
75 2018-05-21 23:14:53 I think Safeway only stocks Sapporo iirc
76 2018-05-21 23:14:24 wow amazing. You like the momo there more than weed stocks? You seen market leader twmjf lately?
77 2018-05-21 23:13:08 More people more crime more abuse more powerful guns. Pretty sure there weren’t bump stocks available. Also. Kids were taught to hunt god with guns. Not people
78 2018-05-21 23:12:01 It's not a uniquely American epidemic. Either start using Google, or stop lying to your constituency, senator. Automatic weapons are already banned, there are already universal background checks on all commercial purchases, and even the @NRA supports a ban on bump stocks.
79 2018-05-21 23:11:04 Though true, the ticker change would show clarity into their operation. Thats why after a lot of ticker changes those stocks take a quick run.
80 2018-05-21 23:10:55 I’m not sure lol but there are stocks under 5 dollars. I’m pretty such it could generate some growth. Not much but some.
81 2018-05-21 23:10:44 A lot of growth stocks repairing their bases today, breakout stock $BA up another $12.69/share, or 3.62%.
82 2018-05-21 23:10:32 Why can't all of my stocks be performing like @Square
83 2018-05-21 23:09:54 I want to start investing in stocks

85 2018-05-21 23:09:40 What a dumb statement. So naive. Stocks booming? I’m down 400k. You? Economy booming? Toys R Us as just one example. We’re completely fucked under trump. Maybe Putin will be a better leader of America when trump hands us over.
86 2018-05-21 23:08:48 I would run this city with an iron fist!
I would reinstate the stocks.
I would reinstate chain gangs.
Police would be allowed to drawl their batons at will when suspects show lack of respect for the law.
I get to wear a ring which would require kissing.
87 2018-05-21 23:08:23 He is an idiot 
Let’s wait & see - this is the longest cycle ever
Many stocks over valued 
& the damage the Fed Reserve did
With “quantitative easing” has not been
accounted for
When Quantitative tightening
doesn’t work....it will get very interesting
Central Banks vs th market

89 2018-05-21 23:06:08 Attention Georgia Voters: If you vote Republican you have no choice about banning the bump stocks. It is not on the Ballot. My husband is Republican and would have voted YES to banning bump stocks. I voted YES to ban bump stocks.
90 2018-05-21 23:04:20 I need someone to teach me stocks

92 2018-05-21 23:03:13 Better buy some more wwe stocks
93 2018-05-21 23:02:23 You know that people mean high capacity assault STYLE guns that can add bump stocks.
94 2018-05-21 23:01:19 Your president put extra money back in our pockets, gave us record low unemployment for ALL people, more people are working, less people are on assistance, stocks have hit many record highs, businesses are coming back, reopening...what are you talking about??!!
95 2018-05-21 23:00:46 Short analogy: A customer went to a locally owned spaza to buy milk and was told they don't have any. Example of comparative advantage. The somalians enjoy scale because they buy together. One spaza owner stocks supplies for 10 of his "colleagues". They collaborate, not compete
96 2018-05-21 23:00:04 Carrots are very much a "seasoning" despite their bulk. No one describes anything as "carrot flavoured"; not even carrot cake.

I like them because of what they add to stocks and in the slow roasting, but I'm always forgetting to buy them.
97 2018-05-21 22:58:47 STOCKS TOPO CHICO is my new favorite "good date location" qualifier
98 2018-05-21 22:58:44 Yep and not to mention there weren’t any high capacity magazines or massive amounts of military style weapons in the hands of civilians. And pretty sure there aren’t any bump stocks laying around 
99 2018-05-21 22:58:08 to keep it simple … accounting: i lowkey wanna work with the forensics department. basically being able to help stop white collar crimes. and finance: i did it to learn about stocks, bonds, etc. so i can help educate the youth about things we don’t learn at a young age.
100 2018-05-21 22:57:24 Early days: buying high, selling low. Crypto was my first foray into investing and I wouldn’t trade that experience for the world. Now I’m doing way better on crypto and have invested in stocks. Life changing.
101 2018-05-21 22:57:00 Gun violence is a uniquely American epidemic & the number of students affected continues to grow. We can’t sit idly by as our children are being killed by gun violence. The time for an assault weapons ban, universal background checks,“red-flag” laws & a ban on bump stocks is NOW!
102 2018-05-21 22:56:51 Under New Jersey’s new bump-stock ban, which was approved in January,  residents were supposed to destroy or turn in their bump stocks by mid-April. So far, New Jersey State Police say, they have not received a single one.
103 2018-05-21 22:55:51 news for the rich.. only the rich hold their assets in stocks.. and GE in particular a hard to get stock
104 2018-05-21 22:55:14 Just a reminder that Trump promised to federally ban bump stocks after the Parkland shooting. But he NEVER signed an executive order or law about it. Thanks for the empty promises @realDonaldTrump
105 2018-05-21 22:54:30 @MadMoneyOnCNBC @jimcramer how much could stocks go up if China and US make a trade deal?
106 2018-05-21 22:54:14 Small cap stocks have under performed their large cap counter parts since 1986.  A breakout above 1986 high would be very bullish.  Otherwise, its just ebb and flow.
107 2018-05-21 22:52:45 May I point out that the need to move money in and out of cryptos to fiat or stocks whenever needed.
108 2018-05-21 22:51:10 Actually he did have a meeting with the NRA and ordered his Attorney General to look at the possibility of bump stocks being legal under current law. And the NRA didn’t agree with him on banning bump stocks. He is also in favor of increasing school security to keep k
109 2018-05-21 22:50:53 Good point some countries want have protein as we know it this is a logical conclusion, some all ready dont partake protein as we know it, environmental limitation. Dwindling fish stocks environmental weather phenomenon its happening in front of our face as we speak.

114 2018-05-21 22:45:37 @CNNPolitics @CNN @wolfblitzer @GloriaBorger UMM, you do realize you can’t impeach a president just because you don’t like him right? You need a crime & there isn’t one. Surely your last few viewers would like to know stocks are up again today. That’s what important to America!
115 2018-05-21 22:45:36 "Preventions from liberties", "ban bump stocks", "fair laws for law abiding citizens",....
116 2018-05-21 22:44:53 You are so right Jim. This says it all. The 2nd amendment needs to be revised. It was 1st written in 1791. Wording needs to be that Military, Police, FBI, and hunters with properly locked cabinets should only have access to guns in America. No bump stocks.
117 2018-05-21 22:43:31 My goal this summer is to learn how to buy stocks
118 2018-05-21 22:43:05 Because they have not committed crimes yet. But if they didn’t have guns would 60 people died in Vegas. Would hundreds of children have died from school shooting if the killers didn’t have ar-15 with bump-stocks?

128 2018-05-21 22:34:45 They are not enforced. There are loop holes. There are no yearly test like in Japan. Only rifles should be allowed. No handguns, no ar-15, no bump stocks
129 2018-05-21 22:34:10 $TSLA has become a religious stock, not one based on the observed. 
And we know that stocks in which there is such strong debate they always end downwards

I love the tech, but h8 for tsla is due to its finances only. The pioneer/inventor rarely makes money, looking at history.
130 2018-05-21 22:33:46 Universal gun laws, including, back ground checks for all states, no exceptions. Tighter regulation of private sales, no selling of high capacity guns unless with special permit, no bump stocks, no open carry, an automatic 10 years for using a gun to commit a crime. Common sense.
131 2018-05-21 22:33:06 Military assault rifles should be banned along with bump stocks. When we say that the right wing nutters start lying and telling their ignorant followers we want to take away their guns.
132 2018-05-21 22:32:50 Where do we go to learn more about preferred stocks or just buy FPF at lows?
133 2018-05-21 22:30:29 2 finance stocks plummeted  on Monday:
$BBDO -12.3%, $QD -16.5%
134 2018-05-21 22:30:15 23 breakouts: $CAF (gap), $LHO (gap), $MBFI (gap), $MOO (gap), $UBSI, $WAB. Five sub-$1 and seven $1-2. Over half of 23 were penny stocks
135 2018-05-21 22:30:08 Je pense qu'en fin de mois les stocks seront de nouveau là
136 2018-05-21 22:30:08 Can we keep the bump stocks in this case though?
137 2018-05-21 22:28:06 Hence why I avoid really reading about it unless it's relevant to the stocks I invest in. It just makes me too angry.
138 2018-05-21 22:27:47 Today was an interesting day in the PM space. Several $GLD and $SLV #mining stocks decided to rip. Could be a precursor to a metals move.
139 2018-05-21 22:26:38 I wish I knew how to fuck with stocks lol
140 2018-05-21 22:26:13 I’m still learning about stocks, almost ready to get my feet wet...
141 2018-05-21 22:25:57 Stocks? Dunking? Or are we gonna boil them in oil?

142 2018-05-21 22:25:53 Ok I don’t know what to do, my frames are dropping faster than Facebook stocks and I’ve done everything possible to fix it and nothing works! I wonder if Twitch servers are down
143 2018-05-21 22:25:31 you mean like the thousands of Muslims celebrating after 9-11 or the 3 million illegals who voted, or the ban on bump stocks? etc, etc, etc
144 2018-05-21 22:25:19 If you’re a good shot or have a full auto mod(which I fully support the ban of, like bump stocks) then yes.
145 2018-05-21 22:24:53 Both great ideas coupled with background checks, ban on military style weapons, bump, stocks and high capacity magazines.   I would also like to see surveillance equipment in every corridor and entry.  Its a great start and we can tweak it from there.  Let's get started!
146 2018-05-21 22:24:37 Disappointed with BT thought I was going to have new Iphone paid Twenty pounds out of my bank. I got a phone call later today to say that they are out of stock. Np they did not offer me an alternitive just told me that they did not know when stocks would be back! Not  good
147 2018-05-21 22:23:05 This is pretty much what I pointed out in my comment on the proposed ATF rule to classify bump stocks and similarly equipped weapons as machine guns (and therefore illegal). The refusal to acknowledge the favorable treatment of guns is ludicrous and moronic and must end.
148 2018-05-21 22:21:47 Yes Obana did that and mire.Made Bump stocks legal 295k was given to Netanyahu opponent and 8.8 million to Soros Albanian Leftist Marxist group to ovetthriw govt.All he did was interfere with elections
149 2018-05-21 22:20:48 I think I am fine on that issue but thanks anyway. I own many foreign stocks.

153 2018-05-21 22:19:38 That's what I'd like to know too. My local Sainsbury's stocks Saber homous from #Israel in the chiller cabinet, and I thought of sticking it all in a trolley and dumping it somewhere else in the store - maybe on another shelf, behind the cornflakes - where it can go bad.
154 2018-05-21 22:19:34 I am well diversified in stocks and bonds. Favor growth stocks that pay dividends. My portfolio includes hundred of stocks both US  and foreign

158 2018-05-21 22:17:41 No your not. I’m saying in general. Healthcare stocks looking decent lately
159 2018-05-21 22:17:05 How many are out there like this?  Note: gun stocks likely much larger than necessary.

162 2018-05-21 22:15:41 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to cure your chronic fatigue
163 2018-05-21 22:15:28 22 #stocks reached all-time highs in "finance", worth noting:
$CBSH, $RJF, $SIVB, $EWBC, $TCF, $SCHW, $NDAQ

166 2018-05-21 22:14:10 But then how will i rebalance my, let's say 80/20 now, because I "purchased" a larger SS with the other 30?  Also, not everything is math:  An 80/20 is hard to hold regardless.  Also, can't just treat assets in a portfolio in isolation; e.g bonds buy stocks low when rebalancing.

171 2018-05-21 22:11:45 Fitting bump stocks to doors will enable people to enter & leave too quickly. They should be banned. It should be impossible for all students to enter before classes finish
172 2018-05-21 22:10:37 We are with you all the way!  You young people ROCK!  We must ban bump stocks!  Great work @davidhogg111 and the rest of you that are leading the charge~

174 2018-05-21 22:09:37 Investigating the FBI is a classic example of Donald Trump deflecting himself onto them and adding to destruction of the United States democracy.  When the stocks rise the Republican Party goes along with him and to save their jobs and power.

182 2018-05-21 22:06:54 Action is needed.  Let’s start by banning bump stocks.
183 2018-05-21 22:05:42 These stocks continue to be under tremendous competitive pressure from knock off brands and other brands. It won't change anytime soon. That is why they are down. When I saw Kraft/Heinz wanted to buy Unilever so soon after merger I knew that was a sign of trouble.
184 2018-05-21 22:05:28 Possible but basically magic to make 12% yearly for 45 straight years. Securities and safe bonds wouldn't ever get you there, so you would have to rely on stocks/crypto
185 2018-05-21 22:03:41 in times like this, a tactical play in the equities market is very beneficial. Particularly if you invest in fundamentally valuable stocks with potential for growth

220 2018-05-21 21:41:50 That is what I thought. That makes sense but now let’s ban all sales of over 10 round magazines for any weapon (except police, military) and ban AR-15 and bump stocks.
221 2018-05-21 21:41:28 Those dates I gave are from the Dow Jones, so it is Stocks.

389 2018-05-21 20:22:03 The Las Vegas shooter Stephan Paddock shot so many people quickly. He was able to legally purchase bump stocks, high capacity clips & other modification devices that enabled him to shoot 700 rounds per minute.  The manufacturers & sellers are responsible for that
390 2018-05-21 20:21:47 I've got my work pension, a stocks and shares LISA and a sipp. And I still don't have peace of mind. I need to relax. Dope that you even considered it that early!
391 2018-05-21 20:21:41 Those are all facts, I watch the stocks daily. Maybe you should try that instead of pushing your leftist lies.
392 2018-05-21 20:21:20 I have that much in equity, which I suppose is as close to the same thing as I’ll get. Because I will never “save” that much. It would go into retirement, stocks, something.
393 2018-05-21 20:21:01 Definitely a move away from "defensive" stocks because of low perceived macro risk. But the food stocks just got way too overvalued due to "dividend lust" a couple years ago and they've now lost all that premium and more due to bad fundamentals.
394 2018-05-21 20:20:52 The only get rich quick scheme that works consistently  is the one that says slowly but steadily invest in solid stocks according to your risk/age category. Boring but true.
395 2018-05-21 20:20:11 Why is Neil Cavuto @FoxNews still babbling about stocks when we the people want to hear about the Trump/Rosenstein meeting?? #qanon #maga
396 2018-05-21 20:19:42 are you trying to say that we need another boosted black koji that 3-2 stocks top players? or what
397 2018-05-21 20:19:01 Mr mines problem is,  like many in Congress is holding RUSSIAN STOCKS!!
398 2018-05-21 20:18:39 Inventory is a demand issue.  If they all double ordered then demand would slow in following quarters creating weak demand and excess supply.  One of toughest stocks to trade.  I want to see tomorrow’s reaction and any capital return plans
399 2018-05-21 20:18:33 .@foxnews chyron: "Stocks surge as fears over trade war ease."
400 2018-05-21 20:18:29 $ATVI call buyers today between the flow in $EA and these video game stocks deals could be brewing $MSFT
401 2018-05-21 20:17:53 I don't understand the premise of this argument.

The "people hoarding RL cards are evil" argument is kindof based in people treating Magic cards like stocks, which the people you're referencing are doing.

402 2018-05-21 20:16:46 Food stocks are down bc they are "recession-proof" investments, and nobody believes we're anywhere close to a recession. Thoughts? @michaelsantoli
403 2018-05-21 20:16:02 But how do you estimate future time-average growth of stocks? How do you select a set of assets to invest in? In the real world I think this often relies on feeling, intuition, vision, or whatever you'd like to call it. What else? Historical returns could be misguiding.
404 2018-05-21 20:15:42 I'm aware it would affect folks. If i had not needed to sell my stuff when I got assaulted, it'd hurt me too. Still say if you wanna invest, goto stocks, or play in the same risky investments we all have to
405 2018-05-21 20:15:18 Yes, a pyramid scheme. Imagine owning stocks in 1980 before 401K’s. How rich would you be now?

482 2018-05-21 19:37:20 When I first started trading - with only a few thousand $ - and made my first million in stocks, commissions were $175 per trade, you had to call a broker and they had to call the floor and then call you back to make a trade, and spreads were often $3 on a stock! Excuses??? 
483 2018-05-21 19:37:18 I don't understand your point. Guns (particularly assault weapons) make it easy to quickly kill many people. Knives are not as deadly. If we reduced our murder rate by guns we would also greatly reduce our homicide rate overall. Imagine the LV shooting w/o AR-15s & bump stocks

493 2018-05-21 19:33:17 On the other hand, if #SDLive goes to #FOX and continues being a Live show, I'm excited for what it could mean for @WWE as a whole.

655 2018-05-21 18:21:53 Agreed. Think one more sharp move up rates to get us there some time in 2018 with accompanying wobble in stocks/EM creating buy for next leg up

666 2018-05-21 18:16:30 So uh... what about bump stocks?
667 2018-05-21 18:15:37 We can have only one. Once you buy a new one, you have to sell the old one within 6 months.
668 2018-05-21 18:15:25 cayeron sus stocks. El 10 de mayo hicieron un comunicado en el que explicaban que Yuimetal sigue formando parte del grupo, pero que se incorporará nuevamente después porque ha empezado "Una nueva era para el grupo". De hecho, en la página web +

671 2018-05-21 18:10:37 The only research I’ve seen where they may be on par is when funds don’t exclude certain stocks, but instead look through for quality related measures. But I’d call that ESG-lite. Like someone who is vegetarian, but eats fish and meat when their friends cook it.
672 2018-05-21 18:09:55 I just recently counted my remaining Flashstrike comic stocks & it's only 30 copies left out from 180 copies I've printed  I should have printed it 200 o.o
673 2018-05-21 18:09:44 EXACTLY

Like the Crush vs. dizz match that everyone hates on Crush for

If I'm in dizz's position, I'm thinking "sweet, he's not following up on his hits, thanks for letting me back for free lol".

Or I recognize that it's my fault for being down 3 stocks to 1 in the first place
674 2018-05-21 18:09:06 How is libs name calling? It’s short for liberals. I didn’t say libtards or any other derogatory version. And you absolutely were equating the increase of bump stocks to something sinister.
675 2018-05-21 18:08:17 Using this as a definition then: a lightweight rifle developed from the sub-machine gun, which may be set to fire automatically or semi-automatically. I understand you say full-auto isn't available to purchase. I believe bump-stocks are being banned too.
676 2018-05-21 18:08:09 Remember: This is the man who PERSONALLY promised the Parkland survivors he'd stand up to the NRA on bump stocks and background checks.

Then IMMEDIATELY went to the NRA and... didn't even mention those things, like the weak NRA bootlicker he is.

682 2018-05-21 18:06:02 If you simply acquiesced to popular demands, like background checks, no guns for those with mental health problems, ban bump stocks, maybe an age limit of 21, the same as alcohol. NO ONE IS SAYING BAN GUNS. You can keep your pew pew toys. Just follow the majority opinion maybe?

688 2018-05-21 18:03:12 Re: Tan Liu's "The Ponzi Factor"...is remarkable for addressing our tacit acceptance of the "speculative formula," a formalized 'what-if,' into an overt inspection of this form. My grandparents: "Do not place in stocks what you cannot lose."

731 2018-05-21 17:44:28 The Sec of Treasury is primarily supposed to be the principal economic advisor to the President & play a critical role in policy making by bringing economic & gov financial policy perspective to issues facing the government...not to comment on stocks. Mnuchin = sleaze.

749 2018-05-21 17:35:06 Actually none of it’s bad. Stocks are also good. You pay taxes and by definition are helping business which hire people. Might not be as smart to carry cash. Don’t know anyone that just has assets in cash. FG doesn’t.

789 2018-05-21 17:19:18 As an Oklahoman who has a weapons license, I can state unequivocally that bump stocks have no good purpose other than causing maximum damage and/or killing power in a short amount of time. Make them illegal!!!

791 2018-05-21 17:18:30 There has been so much abuse of austerity planning since the 2007-8 financial crisis. Generations of youths are being forced to worry whether whole professions will collapse due to soulless capitalists using shock-doctrine thinking to cut wages, cut hiring--all while stocks rise.

794 2018-05-21 17:17:38 You are right.  That's why Obama introduced legislation that Trump then did away with.. Trump has no intention of putting any controls in place.. I read yesterday that he actually never signed the legislation to ban bump stocks.

799 2018-05-21 17:16:19 The maths means it's easier to grow fast with a smaller portfolio of course; the bigger your pot the tougher it is to repeat that, eg my SIPP's 5 year annualised return is 13.59% as of today, keep compounding that and I'll retire happy (c.70 stocks, largest holding c.3% of total)

818 2018-05-21 17:08:07 Done! Anyone who argues against banning them is saying that the 58 people killed and 500 ppl injured wasn't bad enough to act!

992 2018-05-21 15:53:28 How have stocks done in Japan? From 26 to 90, stocks did way better. For the last 28 years, bonds have done far better.
Is Japan that different that it couldn't happen here?
Ibbotson started in 26 and that eliminates all 15 year periods ending in the 30s where bonds won.

1148 2018-05-21 14:48:41 That might be true, because we think based on our FPCMC valuation model $TSLA will soar much higher to a market cap of at least $250 Billion and a stock price at least 500-600% higher than today's price.

1157 2018-05-21 14:42:54 Similar to 1920s. Futures fall into speculation. Investing safer if stay in low-risk but not much profit. Stocks high,returns low right now. Staple stocks like food,soap etc. not so subject to speculation.

1204 2018-05-21 14:27:48 An accurate characterization of what Trump as done is tear this country apart. All Trump cares about is his self. He promised to banned bump stocks with an executive order & has not done so. All this President cares about is the "imagined Witch Hunt".

1323 2018-05-21 13:38:22 David seems to have grown increasingly more radical. He no longer speaks about banning assault weapons or bump stocks, but now speaks about no one needing guns and why do people need them at all if we have a supposed violent country anyways.

1330 2018-05-21 13:37:44 I believe he is sincere (am I being overly lenient?), but his mood swings on some stocks is wildly terrible. He sure as hell didn't mention he has been relentlessly bearish on Micron this year. Now its all 'very bullish'.

1338 2018-05-21 13:35:35 “Common sense” seems to be in the eye of the beholder though. That what scares me. It’s very much open to interpretation. In some people eyes that means banning bump stocks, in others that means complete confiscation and banning of everything.

1363 2018-05-21 13:26:47 Bump stocks are already banned, automatic weapons have been banned since 1934, we already have background checks and gun licenses would be pointless. None of these will prevent any mass shooting or shooting in general or make it difficult for one to happen. You’re either a troll

1365 2018-05-21 13:25:50 To start with, sales of semi-automatic weapons should be banned, there should be aggressive buy-back campaigns for the 300 million weapons now in circulation, and gun paraphernalia (ammo, sights, stocks, scopes, etc.) should all be heavily taxed.

1377 2018-05-21 13:15:59 Do you really think anyone cares.  This is not the biggest problem in our daily lives.  Work on some of your promises like banning bump stocks, common sense gun control reforms, national debt, infrastructure..........In other words, do your job.

1401 2018-05-21 12:58:44 It is a nonsense argument anyway, the whole economy benefits from the single market, not just those who export. EU imports are what puts goods into our shops, gets cars, machines, planes & ships built in our factories, keeps our power plants running & stocks our pharmacies.

1406 2018-05-21 12:57:20 No, @JoeNBC, Trump’s “trade war” hasn’t been all “smoke and mirrors.” It has devastated my PG stock & I’m sure it’s had a similar impact on all stocks that are involved in international markets. It’ll take > a 1-day market rally 2 repair the damage done by Trump & his orange ego.
1407 2018-05-21 12:56:11 Stop the madness. Kids and all people shouldn’t consider mass shootings as a ‘normal way of life’ in America. There must be a ban on Bump Stocks.

1409 2018-05-21 12:53:00 the increase during the Obama admin. Is due to the artificial manipulation of interest rates. Borrowing money was almost free and falsely inflated profits. Stocks work on how policy will effect a company in the future. There is almost no residual effect from a previous admin.

1417 2018-05-21 12:51:20 Trump stocks his every appearance with a cheerleading posse. Their job is to station themselves by the nearest microphone and make as much noise at the appropriate pauses. Someone should really document that.
1418 2018-05-21 12:51:13 Property, stocks, high-value jewelry, antiquities, etc. Nothing that typically depreciates. On the same level, my great-grandparents were forced off their farm & forced to undersell their hotel (The Dreamland Hotel) where black performers stayed when in Philly. Early 1900s.

1421 2018-05-21 12:49:25 Had the a huge dump based on policy implementation that was restrictive and expensive for companies. Made a small gain over all due to crazy low interest rates to falsely prop up a weakened and sick economy. Trump policy made stocks climb. Stocks operate based on future not past.

1427 2018-05-21 12:45:35 In that case, we'd keep trying to amend the issue. Right now, the only gun control measures I want are just the ban of sales to violent criminals, terrorists, and stalkers. Also bump stocks, nobody actually needs those.

1451 2018-05-21 12:35:02 Good news for stocks: it looks like China and the US have negotiated better trade terms, putting more pressure on NK, deep state bad actors are finally being found out, and possibly brought to justice, corporate earnings and revenues are surging, and economy picking up.
1452 2018-05-21 12:34:22 If you can't use it to aim at a target, it is not an "arm." It is a toy.

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

Ban bump stocks.

1462 2018-05-21 12:28:06 Dear BM, you have been recommending many stocks directly & indirectly via Twitter, TV interviews etc. Am sure many would have bought those stocks after reading your messages.

1465 2018-05-21 12:26:12 just invest in other people's addictions. Apparently it is iPhone now. After soda, candy, furniture, oil, batteries. Make sure they pay dividends and do buybacks. Then complain about missing out on stocks that never met your criteria to buy so the fools can continue to buy them.
1466 2018-05-21 12:26:08 In my view, when finding good stocks you have to trade off a number of factors.  Some will be great and others will be questionable.  You then have to form an "on balance" type view.  Having a strict checklist to find good stocks would mean missing lots of opportunities.
1467 2018-05-21 12:24:51 I keep getting asked about interest rates and the stock market. Recall my book and Twitter posts.. rising interest rates are bullish for stocks as they reflect economic strength. Later when reflecting inflation, they pressure stocks.
1468 2018-05-21 12:23:44 @guardian @elonmusk There is no trade deal with China, there is still a trade war going on.  Currently there is no deal on NAFTA and trade wars are escalating with Mexico, Europe, and Japan.  Money will flow out of stocks into bonds and Comodities. @realDonaldTrump

I never implied they would be made automatic. But having bump stocks is as close as one can get to automatic. (1/2)

1581 2018-05-21 11:17:20 That's the new Hitlerian method isn't it. Project onto the other person and accuse them of what you, yourself are doing. Disagreement is not bullying, nor would it trigger a mass shooting in anyone but a completely irrational person. I wud ban bump stocks & high capacity clips.
1582 2018-05-21 11:16:57 i understand that gun control alone won't work. This problem requires a multi-solution fix. Off the top of my head this would be a start:

-Ban AR-15 & all weapons like it.
-mental health checks
-background checks
-ban bump stocks
-raise gun purchasing age to 21 for ALL weapons
1583 2018-05-21 11:14:04 Bump stocks are already banned.  Nice try at keeping yourself relevant.

1605 2018-05-21 10:57:07 That is correct. Seems to be quite a lot momentum in stocks at the moment, partly due to the pound weakening again.

1608 2018-05-21 10:54:47 The S&P500 covers 500 stocks. The DJIA only covers 30 and it’s price (not volume) weighted. I was referring to fund managers *I’ve worked for* so don’t correct me. And of course you had low GDP under Obama, your economy was recovering from the GFC.

Banning semi-auto guns means banning nearly all currently legal guns. 

Bump stocks are rarely used in crimes and are difficult to use.

1623 2018-05-21 10:44:32 S&P500 is 80% of the market. 20 Trillion of the 25 Trillion. Just 5 stocks will be 20% of the market soon. By 2030 S&P500 could be it. 95% of the market with top 10 at over a trillion each and few at several trillion market cap. Only 1 of 2000 top 5 is on list. Same by 2030
1624 2018-05-21 10:44:23 AGAIN I see the markets turning much higher going into later summer and fall but for that outlook to stay true we may have to endure some pain before is these big players decide to breakdown. Maybe a shakeout??? Lets let price show us the way 
#Stocks #Futures #ETFs #SP500
1625 2018-05-21 10:43:15 Please get informed. Ban bump stocks of you want. AR15s are not military grade weapons. They are .223. A very low caliber gun. They do NOT spray bullets. Same as every other semi auto rifle. If you want to ban all guns then be honest and say so.
1626 2018-05-21 10:42:50 “The trick is not to learn to trust your gut feelings, but rather to discipline yourself to ignore them. Stand by your stocks as long as the fundamental story of the company hasn’t changed.”

1696 2018-05-21 09:42:12 Not at all. In fact I endorse that strategy! But buying stocks making 52w highs indiscriminately is also not the strategy........
1697 2018-05-21 09:41:45 so true. 15/18 stocks are down in my portfolio more than 15% from top but overall portfolio is down 4% (including today) from top because all stocks dont hit all time top at same time.

An ETF is a collection (or "basket") of tens, hundreds, or sometimes thousands of stocks or bonds in a single fund.

If you've ever owned a mutual fund—particularly an index fund—then owning an ETF will feel familiar because it has the same built-in diversification

1710 2018-05-21 09:34:54 .....asset allocation is more important than selection across all markets. This holds true for stocks, for crypto, for anything. So your win by allocating to crypto is far more important than allocating to poor performing cryptos

1712 2018-05-21 09:33:19 Took some profits off $DCR and put in some buy orders for penny stocks. These are gambles that can either lock up your funds, cut your position to nothing or give easy 5-20x with a single pump. For example $TTC, $MINT, $LINDA. Complete shitcoins but profit potential is there.
1713 2018-05-21 09:32:11 increases odds of a squeeze due to increased odds of short trap. but it doesn't even have to be due to a trap, somebody could also just cover/buy big position and the stock just gets moved and it leads to a squeeze eventually, as a new short you should be avoiding thin stocks

A hot topic that most people agree on?  YES.  Universal background checks.  Banning bump stocks. Improved mental health support. Etc. Etc.
1941 2018-05-21 06:05:39 Despite 'notably lacking in specifics' (GS), Asa stocks seem to like US/China trade headlines. Mnuchin: "Trade war is on hold". Liu He (FT/Xinhua) tells both sides agreed not to go ahead with imposing tariffs. USD likes it even more. USDCNY tops 6.38, USDJPY 111.30, EURUD 1.1745

1954 2018-05-21 05:59:27 i think this is not applicable to all stocks. for eg : Spicejet is at very very cheap valuation right now,  considering 50 new flights will be added to its fleet in next 24 months

A president can only sign a,bill into law that is brought to him by the house.  A president runs the executive branch.  He can give executive orders to run that branch.  Bump stocks are not part of the executive branch.

2002 2018-05-21 05:29:38 New store alert: Calliope at MOA! Great selection of clothes from casual to formal wear. Price is average but stocks are limited :(
2003 2018-05-21 05:28:35 Yes! Stocks go up, then when RSI is high, profit is taken. Unfortunately, brings in the mm shorters also, BUT, w/the fair dilution rules now in place, we can take profit at peaks, and buy back in at bottoms. This is what sustains runs (of course, the co has to have valid updates)
2004 2018-05-21 05:25:32 Stocks go up when we Buy on the Ask. Stocks continue runs when the bid whacks are less than the Buys on Ask.  Its that simple, math wise. What takes studying is what co's are worth buying and holding.  Lets Do this!

2034 2018-05-21 04:49:42 Yes, bans against owning #AR15s, bump stocks and other weapons of mass destruction will apply to people, not guns.

2064 2018-05-21 04:31:51 Trump played the students and parents of the DEAD with another LIE to ban bump stocks. A Camara and crowd record his remarks. He just wants them to leave the WH so he can crawl under the bridge and await the next shooting. A Troll in Full.

2069 2018-05-21 04:25:00 R u disagree with extensive background check? For banning bump stocks and machine guns that fire many rounds in couple minutes? With taking care of mental health issues in this country? What’s ur stand on these?
2070 2018-05-21 04:24:40 @realDonaldTrump why don't you do something presidential and actually start saving the lives of innocent children from gun violence? Ban bump stocks. Ask for Universal background checks for all weapon purchases. Show us that the NRA doesn't have your nuts in a jar. #BeBest #DoIt

2098 2018-05-21 03:50:30 Please let’s include assault weapons in this but personally I would like to see assault weapons banned and I do not want to hear the argument then only criminals will own them and bump stocks
2099 2018-05-21 03:50:24 I was referring to assault weapons, such as the AR-15, not stocks.  I think those bump stocks should be banned.  I am undecided on banning assault weapons, but I feel 18 year olds should not be able to buy them.

2115 2018-05-21 03:41:28 The attribution of *one* motive to stocks & flows raises difficulties? Like attributing motive to a migrating herd, saying its motive is seasonal ‘want’ of water or grazing? It’s not that the stocks & flows are meaningless, & exporters do exchange foreign for domestic currency.
2116 2018-05-21 03:40:23 Ban bump stocks, require background checks. Make parents complicit when  their children become mass murders etc etc etc. in other words Wake Up  America.

Last game he finally gets a stock off me, saves the replay, says "GG" and leaves the lobby.

Cool.

2147 2018-05-21 03:15:49 It's definitely a favourite of mine; I've made a point of keeping stocks of it both home and work.

2155 2018-05-21 03:09:26 It would, however, be interesting to know if the NRA coordinated mass mailers to oppose banning bump stocks, given that they had publicly backed the idea after the Vegas shooting.
2156 2018-05-21 03:08:19 Never heard of an anti- Second Amendment protest.  Not a right-left issue, even though disagree on many things.  American issue.  Both "sides" favor common sense action, such as universal background checks, no-fly=no gun, ban bump stocks ( s/have happened STAT post Las Vegas)

2172 2018-05-21 02:59:40 So here's a few tips FWIW:  1.  Watch list:  stick to the leaders of the market using a top down approach per Livermore  Your watch list should be 25 MAX!  Why are you watching 200 stocks when you can't possibly own 200 stocks?  Even 25, getting it <10 is even better!  #simplify
2173 2018-05-21 02:59:34 Even some of those are semi automatic with bump stocks!

Century Textiles to demerge cement division and merges it with UltraTech Cement.

Endurance Tech says entitled for Rs 283 crore industrial promotion subsidy.

Alembic Pharma gets one Form 483 observation on Karkhadi API unit.
2182 2018-05-21 02:49:07 Actually congress isn’t allowed to ban bump stocks, nor are comments. You know, that whole Amendements / Rights thingy.
2183 2018-05-21 02:48:25 It always seems to be a lot harder to get investor buy in to recovery stocks on low single digit P/E’s than stocks on 30x earnings. Too much taken on trust with the latter, too little with the former.
2184 2018-05-21 02:48:14 Lass... you simply don't know SHIT about me.

Continue to try to ridicule or shame me... I enjoy laughing.

PS - I support stricter laws for *all* gun owners... but you ain't getting my guns.

The best anyone gets (as I keep saying) is... split stocks, pieces, & slag. Maybe.

2229 2018-05-21 02:35:07 I have to be honest here as I'm hoping it will help some NOT make the same mistakes that I used to make several years ago. Just like with stocks or watch lists, you cannot own em all so why watch em all?  Why are you watching other traders post their setups?  Why? Think about it!
2230 2018-05-21 02:33:28 Bump stocks are good for absolutely nothing.
2231 2018-05-21 02:33:00 Jean-Marie will be remembered, for sure. He co-honored in 2001 by Morningstar, Inc. as "Stock Manager of the Year" and was a finalist for their 2009 "fund manager of the decade award for non-U.S. stocks". In 2003, the group gave him a "Fund Manager Lifetime Achievement" award.
2232 2018-05-21 02:30:03 Poverty is unnecessary! forex stocks investment
2233 2018-05-21 02:28:55 Yeah, taking over with stocks at 6900 and 10% unemployment and leaving at 19700 and 4.7% is nothing. Created 11 mill new jobs! Then those 2 middle class and small business tax cuts. Oh, and healthcare for 13 million people. Osama Bin Laden, Iran denuclearization.
2234 2018-05-21 02:28:42 when stocks are going down remember, even 30-50% win rate in stocks can also generate FD beating returns. (provided other don't go to zero). key is to hold on.....
2235 2018-05-21 02:27:45 never rule anything out - but a lot of individual stocks have been acting well, better than the market - I can sense some underlying strength
2236 2018-05-21 02:27:16 -shorting stocks

All of the bad financial innovations have a common theme : counterfeit liquidity.  stealing liquidty is the wealth siphon.
2237 2018-05-21 02:26:05 Time 2 outlaw semi automatic weapons and bump stocks. It may take awhile to get them all off the streets but we could do it. We could at least try..  then maybe we should put police stations in schools no reason we can't combine the the two. Save lives and money.
2238 2018-05-21 02:26:01 It’s got potential for upside in the near future unlike other penny stocks this is a REAL company with lots of revenue, Im thinkin 0.0050.
2239 2018-05-21 02:25:07 So, you like the stock market gains, then? Have a vested interest Apparently? You must be one of those 1%who got to use their tax scam to buy back stocks...Nothing helped me.. Even gas at a 4yr high.. Even if I had a dollar increase, that wiped it out.

2249 2018-05-21 02:16:46 Oliver North, incoming NRA chief, blames school shootings on ‘culture of violence’

He's not wrong. Only a culture who idolizes violence demands high-powered rifles, extended magazines, bump stocks, and other high-capacity weapons be easily available and carried in nearly all /1

2266 2018-05-21 01:58:36 Teaching you to buy stocks* I've watched the videos and they're very informative. Get Godfrey back on he is hilarious. keep doing what your doing, most entertaining interviews on the internet
2267 2018-05-21 01:58:22 Do you need an AR 15 to protect your family?  A bump stock?  If so, you have some big problems, dude.  Won’t you engage in a rational discussion about sensible gun legislation?  Universal background checks? Ban bump stocks? Re-up the assault weapons ban?
2268 2018-05-21 01:56:46 Its old news,
2269 2018-05-21 01:56:35 Let’s face it there’s good and bad with any politician, both sides. They’re all corrupt in my opinion. But the economy is doing great, unemployment is at an all time low, stocks/401k’s are doing phenomenal, in general we’re paying less income tax. I’m sure you can get behind that
2270 2018-05-21 01:55:42 After investing in this call,  can I look at investing in the model portfolio stocks. Do u mention price at which one can enter in model portfolio stocks
2271 2018-05-21 01:55:24 It is a simple fix. Stop taking money from the NRA,ban military grade assault rifles and things like bump stocks that make semi automatics automatics, and make it harder to get a gun which means have more severe background checks.
2272 2018-05-21 01:55:18 Haven’t really posted much. Been riding the same stocks now as no stops have been hit for a while. In $PANW $TWTR $SPLK $VEEV $ISRG $LULU

2279 2018-05-21 01:49:23 Are you for outlawing AR-15s, bump stocks, high capacity magazines....

2282 2018-05-21 01:42:55 Wow, shorts are going to have to try really hard to bring this down..the accumulation in the current range is ridiculous..most stocks would have crashed back to trips after moving this quickly..this thing is a beast $COHO pennytown is coming!
2283 2018-05-21 01:41:47 My psychiatrist stocks them, I'll drink one whenever I see her and that's it

2286 2018-05-21 01:37:59 Morning friends. Have, in the past several times, i have tweeted about being bullish on FMCG stocks. The appreciation they have given in the recent past is testimony to my belief. I continue believe in the sector. Anytime is a good time to buy into the sector but with a long term
2287 2018-05-21 01:37:06 NRA blamed shootings on almost everything imaginable over past twenty years EXCEPT for assault weapons, semi-autos, bump stocks: you get the picture. We need to call NRA bluff & promote "severe" gun laws that SCOUS will accept (it's possible) & screw them royally. Sound good?
2288 2018-05-21 01:36:45 Stocks are kept in suitcases. But where do you find funds?
2289 2018-05-21 01:36:44 An M16 is able to go full auto with the flick of a switch, whereas the AR-15 cannot. They never mentioned bump stocks in that video, which I will grant shouldn't exist in the first place.
2290 2018-05-21 01:36:42 And a ban on AR15s, no bump stocks, no silencers-along with background checks at ALL POINT OF SALES. Guns should be IMMEDIATELY removed from people committing domestic violence (& order of protection against them), no guns sold to people on "no fly" (terrorist) watch lists.
2291 2018-05-21 01:36:17 So how is that false? People CAN get killed if bump stocks are banned? I don’t get it.....
2292 2018-05-21 01:35:33 why stocks are on OTC
2293 2018-05-21 01:35:22 "high capacity magazines"=all magazines

2294 2018-05-21 01:35:19 Really? So this form allows a coalition of citizens to ban a product, any type of product...without having legislation to outlaw it? I hate bump stocks...but the govt has to do their thing to get them banned.  #gunsense
2295 2018-05-21 01:35:02 At least ANZ will know what stocks to short before any spending decisions are made
2296 2018-05-21 01:34:43 I really hope that was a joke cause if it’s not you’re actually retarded. No AR-15 is fully automatic unless modified to be so with the change of a receiver. Bump stocks imitate it but still aren’t TRULY full auto
2297 2018-05-21 01:33:57 Foreign investors dumped 2.48b ringgit of Malaysian stocks last week, the heaviest weekly selldown since Aug. 2013
2298 2018-05-21 01:33:40 First News 21 May 2018 - US stocks weekly loss amid trade talks and yields, PSEi -0.28% to 7672 (16.2x), DMC, LR, PAL/MAC, MWIDE, MPI, HLCM, PSB, MPI.DMC - Maynilad, TEL, MER, UNI/DNA - Suspended
2299 2018-05-21 01:33:21 Few weeks later Steam Stocks when down by 69%
2300 2018-05-21 01:33:08 There should be no question about this... Bump stocks should be banned.
2301 2018-05-21 01:32:39 Thanks Brian. Yes, it would have been a different mkt. But, I would not have bought those same stocks since they weren’t leaders anymore.

Other stks took the lead, such as: $CRM $AAPL $NFLX $AMZN $GOOG $PCLN $VMW $TASR etc
2302 2018-05-21 01:27:06 Ban Bump Stocks Now

2304 2018-05-21 01:22:12 U. S companies have posted great earnings but investors shouldn't count on that to give give their stocks a boost.
2305 2018-05-21 01:21:02 jin looks like he could plummet all of my stocks and ruin every one of my finances and id absolutely be a-ok with that
2306 2018-05-21 01:20:00 Ban bump stocks
2307 2018-05-21 01:19:51 We will now strengthen gun control nationally, making U.S. persons safer.  We will ban semi-automatic weapons, bump stocks, gun shows, & will make parents criminally liable when their weapons are accessible to children.  We will make USA greater again.  And this will happen.
2308 2018-05-21 01:17:20 What are your thoughts on scalping the opening of the market? Mostly popular stocks like NFLX,  TSLA,  BABA,  AAPL etc.
2309 2018-05-21 01:16:39 @Amber_Stocks great job coach! We are looking good. The team is fun to watch. Gotta cut down on those unforced turnovers though. I wanna see you all play when y’all come to dc. Hook a brother up . Go sky......

2313 2018-05-21 01:15:39 Ban bump stocks!
2314 2018-05-21 01:12:02 Was thinking the same thing after this news got out. I went back into stocks the last 2 weeks. Let's see this roar.
2315 2018-05-21 01:10:48 . So the middle class can afford true blue chip stocks? No Mexico wont pay for it
2316 2018-05-21 01:10:40 I bought a couple stocks for the last time Imve had the hiccups before today.
2317 2018-05-21 01:10:19 Ban bump stocks. No automatic weapons are needed except by military.  If sold outside, they are held accountable. Gun shows made illegal. There is no such thing as COMMON sense anymore. Sadly.
2318 2018-05-21 01:10:17 Law enforcement doesn't use bump stocks.

2319 2018-05-21 01:09:40 I felt very lonely so I bought some stocks.

It's nice to have a bit of company.

2321 2018-05-21 01:06:17 That's awesome!  Congratulations.  However, had you read that book in 2004 and bought the same stocks, you would have had a much different outcome.
2322 2018-05-21 01:06:15 I have a relative that's an NRA nut job. He has enough weapons to guard Fort Knox incl AR15 and bump stocks. He bragged that 5 of his guns were bought through a pvt party so he didn't need a license. Smh

2325 2018-05-21 01:04:47 Wrong. People are demanding a ban on all high capacity magazines and bump stocks, as well as on any carbines that can be modified to be automatic.
2326 2018-05-21 01:03:41 I just can’t believe how many #DeepState operatives are willing to lose their credibility and reputations etc for Obama and Clinton! They are laughing stocks now and I guess that’s why they are on CNN and MSN? You would think at some point they would have given in?

2330 2018-05-21 01:01:17 $SPY Feels good already positioned when markets are poised to move higher. That being said, I still see stocks with great upside potential.

2334 2018-05-21 00:59:15 Yes!  Ban bump stocks now!!

2337 2018-05-21 00:56:58 Well There is the NRA talking points!No one wants your guns. For The Atypical Amosexual it's Not about your gun but about Expanding Background checks, Banning Bump Stocks and High Capacity magazines, Limiting Mental ill and Domestic Abusers From Owning Guns. I Am Gun Owner.
2338 2018-05-21 00:56:17 We want bump stocks banned now - we stand with u David!
2339 2018-05-21 00:55:59 Does @Everytown support the ban on bump stocks and military-style weapons, like the AR-15, being ban from commercial access?

2342 2018-05-21 00:53:17 Why would do we need to make deadly weapons more deadly. Bump stocks are not needed. Life is not movie or a video game. We need to get real on gun reform. #BanBumpStocks
2343 2018-05-21 00:52:11 Newbie here. No John.
All one has to do is look at the price of U or the stock prices of U stocks to understand the good times that ended 7-10 yrs ago may just now be coming back
2344 2018-05-21 00:51:23 Yep. One of the big things that helped me focus on only the big winners 10yrs ago, was from looking at the IBD wkly charts. 

I noticed the Huge volume expansion in just a few of the very special stocks. They usually followed thru with steep price moves that lasted 1-2yrs.
2345 2018-05-21 00:50:52 Mega Runs EVERYDAY since new funding rules, stocks making .0001 to .0010+ moves daily, Rare Opportunity! Don’t Miss It! At this moment, No market can compare to .0001 - .01 range in OTC!
2346 2018-05-21 00:50:31 Will be a good early test for Amber Stocks' team. Up 1 at home middle of the 4th. #wnbainsidr
2347 2018-05-21 00:49:59 I wish Amber Stocks would play Stefanie Dolson and Alaina Coates together. They could be dangerous with Dolson's passing and outside shooting.
2348 2018-05-21 00:49:12 Banning bump stocks and instituting universal background checks would help too. #CommonSense
2349 2018-05-21 00:49:10 Ban bump stocks
2350 2018-05-21 00:48:48 Money shouldn't accept htis out of control stocks .
2351 2018-05-21 00:48:44 Ahh.. the outrage of the uninformed...DJT announced an EO to ban bump stocks months ago and its being finalized by the DOJ..... there is nothing that could have changed this shooting and the 2nd amendment allows citizens to own legal weapons which these were..you are irrational
2352 2018-05-21 00:47:18 Asfjask they are even slower tbh
I think KEXOl-ls should buy stocks like elfs did, thats the only way SM will care 
2353 2018-05-21 00:46:59 And he went thumb sucking fetal on China... good for stocks tomorrow though
2354 2018-05-21 00:44:50 I do not care. Make a change, even if it's largely symbolic. I work with guys who own AR's AND bump-stocks, retired cops, retired military... and they will tell you, to a man, that the average citizen does not need either one.
2355 2018-05-21 00:44:04 Please ban bump stocks. It’s not everything, but it’s a start. We need to keep people safe.
2356 2018-05-21 00:43:59 As a teacher #IfIDieInASchoolShooting please politicize the hell out of it and use me as an example of why we desperately need to change our gun laws, to ban assault rifles, to increase $ for mental health, ban bump stocks! #NeverAgainMSD #NeverAgainIsAlwaysAgain#thisneedstostop
2357 2018-05-21 00:43:33 My grandpa invested in bank stocks in the 1950s. He was also a farmer and very frugal. My dad inherited it about 20 years ago, when the estate tax was in play. He had to sell some of the stock to pay the taxes, and it was a large enough sale to move the market that day.
2358 2018-05-21 00:41:11 @realDonaldTrump is all talk and no action. He must have forgotten to ask the #NRA for permission to ban bump stocks.  He is controlled by money.
2359 2018-05-21 00:40:42 Most stocks are WAY up since Trump was elected.
2360 2018-05-21 00:40:29 It really was! Which is funny cause it was suppose to rain all weekend ha
2361 2018-05-21 00:39:47 Probably 6 or 7 lol
2362 2018-05-21 00:39:36 Bump stocks are not addressing my point in a tragic accident while daggering over an active volcano.
2363 2018-05-21 00:38:57 Time to sell your stocks.
2364 2018-05-21 00:38:27 Totally agree today was an embarrassment, but remember it's already on the agenda. There's more going on behind the scenes then people realise. Of course now I've just been elected to council too, we'll be continuing to fight for fundamental changes for working class actors!
2365 2018-05-21 00:38:20 This is a win for everyone. Folks can buy any gun they want. No banning certain guns or bump stocks necessary! 100% accountability needed
2366 2018-05-21 00:37:23 I bet the GOP would be against Bump Stocks on Vibrators!
2367 2018-05-21 00:35:43 I just can’t believe how many #DeepState operatives are willing to lose their credibility and reputations etc for Obama and Clinton! They are laughing stocks now and I guess that’s why they are on CNN and MSN? You would think at some point they would have given in?
2368 2018-05-21 00:35:39 I’m going with misinformed, do the research , AR15 was the planned result of professional shooters and hunters, modifying their weapons with custom stocks and, accessories, Armlite designed the AR-15 so hunting and home protection wasn’t reserved for the wealthy
2369 2018-05-21 00:35:33 U have mentioned 3 buy stocks.. similarly can u mention 3 sell stocks ?
2370 2018-05-21 00:35:22 For hell sake, bump stocks are horrendous, but this just the tip of the iceberg. #nomoregunsperiod
2371 2018-05-21 00:35:15 I remember Hugo saying "This is even" when Hbox was down 2 stocks to 4 against someone at Summit, so I said it to myself then. Turns out we were right LMAO
2372 2018-05-21 00:34:46 Bumps stocks aren’t the problem
2373 2018-05-21 00:34:30 @nra How about the 65 YO madman who with semiautomatic weapons converted to automatic with bump stocks killed 58 (one of which was 21 YO cousin of my son-in-law) & wounded over 500?  That okay with you?  @nra has no heart & politicians you buy off have no morals.  Disgusting!
2374 2018-05-21 00:34:25 i said "it's done" at 3 stocks to 1 LOL he's insane
2375 2018-05-21 00:33:48 You don’t think he’s earned by destroying ISIS? Giving everyone a bigger paycheck? Doing what the last 4 Preyhavent done by getting N & S Korea to talk? What more do you want? Stocks aren’t good enough? 401 didn’t gain enough? What?
2376 2018-05-21 00:33:20 Time to value our children over guns and bump stocks!  How will you be remembered?
2377 2018-05-21 00:32:53 US stocks closed mostly lower on Friday in choppy trade as jittery investors tried to discern the eventual outcome of recent US-China trade talks
2378 2018-05-21 00:32:12 Sell your stocks. They’ll go under real quick
2379 2018-05-21 00:32:00 Americans don't need help to kill citizens quicker, ban bump stocks!

2381 2018-05-21 00:29:08 You can invest in stocks and properties instead of going to school. You must really love school.
2382 2018-05-21 00:28:53 Stocks should have a good day
2383 2018-05-21 00:27:10 Outlaw bump stocks now...I mean, who would support mass shooting weapons as legal? SICK.

2388 2018-05-21 00:22:13 Bump stocks are an inaccurate waste of ammo. So why ban them?

2396 2018-05-21 00:19:54 How about you look into gun violence? Or the cost of prescription drugs?

2402 2018-05-21 00:05:47 The USD is kind of a ponzi scheme.  When we printed more money than we had in gold (1970's). We then made a deal with the Saudis too only sell their oil in USD. The biggest crime Saddam Hussain committed in the eyes of the US gov was agreeing to sell his oil in the Ruby. IMO

2409 2018-05-21 00:02:25 So the worst that can happen with banned bump stocks is nothing, and anything above that are saved lives, so why not bam bump stocks?
