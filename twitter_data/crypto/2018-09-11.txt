1 2018-09-11 23:59:54 Don't buy that pizza eat a pbandj. That's crypto money
2 2018-09-11 23:59:24 Yup no guarantees about any particular coin. As the tech evolves more efficient coins will replace most of the OG’s. Just think crypto in general will flourish in the years to come regardless of which coins end up on top.
3 2018-09-11 23:59:19 Crypto is full of crap no matter how good they present a token its usage once its up in the exchange it will fail. Check on cmc. Back to paper money i suggest western union app is a good example . $500 they only charge $1.50 receive in a min.
4 2018-09-11 23:59:15 Bu bu but arent crypto dead? How is there people still working on developlement? 
5 2018-09-11 23:59:12 I would have to agree that if there are not the proper precautions taken before implementation of a crypto currency such as atf aml etc and whatever other regulatory procedures they could possibly end up with more issues than they are currently going through.

13 2018-09-11 23:58:10 Real talk tho, esports crypto sounds sus
14 2018-09-11 23:57:58 I've taken a break from paying any attention to $DIG news. It's perpetually a few days away from a situation completely unprecedented in the crypto space that will shock many people
15 2018-09-11 23:57:42 IFA's of "Collective Investments"...... and particularly their clients, have a much greater exposure to "dying stocks" (of which there are many) than the few caught up in the Crypto web of Boom and Bust happening quick-style.
