16 2018-07-07 23:57:01 I liked @crypto_bobby analysis on Tezos, but I'd sat we will see the price much lower than a dollar. That's when I'll consider looking into maybe grabbing a bag.
17 2018-07-07 23:56:59 $btc 
Maybe we make it to $7300ish after all.
18 2018-07-08 23:59:18 You know why crypto is amazing? Bec the best and most sophisticated chartist aren't even sure what's going to happen.

26 2018-07-08 23:57:12 I haven’t seen your stuff. We need good trading tools and platforms for sure... but if you decide to try and sell me a 2/20 black box fund based on intraday systematic signals in crypto it is a whole different mouse hunt...
27 2018-07-08 23:57:00 Professional team, great vision. Working product, solid and validated business.

30 2018-07-08 23:55:59 面白そう
31 2018-07-08 23:55:52 But just because we crypto folks want it to happen means it probably will not . If your objective is to make gains Hedge yourself and get a bag of the 2 coins you hate the most.
32 2018-07-08 23:55:49 As long as we have the support @ 6680 we are still bullish.

Looking to break 6800 still

40 2018-07-06 23:57:00 Unpopular opinion

Millenials/Gen Z should fucking figure out how loans work. Don’t take out a loan with a 12-25% interest for a shit degree that you won’t be able to pay back. 

Life is literally a big math problem.

I’m a millennial but I can do basic math. Don’t @ me
41 2018-07-06 23:56:57 Kind of cool to be here where the internet snd compuer revolutions kicked off. Where do you think the #crypto museum will be located?
42 2018-07-06 23:56:02 Hey @senorLupe I just sprayed my whole fence line with weed killer. Do u know how fuck’n long it takes to spray 4 1/2 acres of fence line with a 1 gal sprayer!? 

Ran out of weed killer near the end so I used my left over 4th of July piss, that shit will kill anything.
43 2018-07-06 23:56:00 The market movers for us are small-medium private companies with lesser resources who need to outsource their blockchain initiatives. That is until larger public companies start offering their own small biz blockchain solutions off market. Cryptocurrency is the difference!
44 2018-07-06 23:55:37 So many people overlook this. I'd imagine there will be a price discount directly before the halving similar to the BTC dip to $1800 before the BCH fork.

46 2018-07-06 23:54:12 Trump has conned you Crypto. He lies so much that any one can clearly see these lies, except those blinded by him...  like a cult.  You honestly believe that a man who has lost millions in fines & settlements over failed con jobs, cares a single thing about you. If you believe

48 2018-07-06 23:53:57 I wish my story was as awesome and inspiring as that.  Last year I wanted to invest some money in crypto.  Stumbled upon @haydentiff and followed her because she looked hot.  Been learning and buying ever since.  Score one for the little guy!!  And by little guy I mean penis:)
