Higher Oil price is nothing to worry about, since this will create higher price for commodities export. If the oil subsidy hike outweigh potential export this will be bad.

38 2018-09-24 21:32:05 These markets can be cruel to an investor's psyche, especially if you've been in $CPG. Hard not to have lost money buying CPG after making a new low on that slide, but capitulating was probably the worst thing to do. Commodities/O&G equities are not for the faint of heart.

Francisco Blanch, head of commodities research at Bank of America Corp.,  said in a note to clients on Monday that signals from OPEC mean "the  likelihood of an oil spike and crash scenario akin to the one observed  in 2008 has increased."

43 2018-09-24 21:20:52 Ground meats, dairy, processed commodities like peanut butter, apple sauce, etc. Can blockchain un-commoditize commodities?
44 2018-09-24 21:15:15 And fashion is USD denominated. Tesco, M&S Food - rely on UK food companies but again commodities inc. derv USD based. So their cost base is up. Example: UK Choc bars have been shrunk. Musgraves & Dunnes must be gearing up own labels, German hard discounters laughing.

46 2018-09-24 21:02:32 The base commodities in that world would be data, waste, energy & land. Everything else exists as files for your replicator. We’d collect pollution and harvest the atoms, so the environment is cleaned up by default. Make fuel, food & medicine using green energy. True abundance.
47 2018-09-24 20:59:11 Capaz este es el valor normal del USD y los commodities por ende están en su valor normal. La soja en el 2001 estaba en 150, en el pico del boom a 600. Cual es lo normal ???

53 2018-09-24 20:39:58 China has led the way in disguising weak economic fundamentals with unsustainable credit growth and government sponsored asset bubbles.

Na véspera, a Arábia Saudita, líder da Organização dos Países Exportadores de Petróleo (Opep), e a Rússia descartaram a possibilidade de aumento na produção de petróleo
123 2018-09-24 17:18:32 ING Bank: 1/2 Having  seen risky assets survive the latest escalation in the US-China #tradewar, investors have rushed to cut long USD/short EM positions. And we've  seen some substantial rallies in commodities too.
124 2018-09-24 17:15:58 That’s a great read. As with cancer, I’m not very keen on the battle metaphor the journalist uses in the last paragraph, but it’s great to see players coming forward. And clubs have a huge responsibility to change their ways and stop seeing players as mere commodities.
125 2018-09-24 17:13:44 So think with me a little.. Ruto is campaigning to be the next president. The VAT  has been raised. Then the same Ruto comes in and wants to look like a hero by saying that some commodities such as cow meat shouldn't be taxed and I quote,

127 2018-09-24 17:02:30 Hot take: a Guerra comercial criada pelo Trump, somada ao reaquecimento da indústria americana, que ao mesmo tempo se fecha para produtos manufaturados, deve impulsionar tanto o mercado de commodities como o de manufaturados para o Brasil.
128 2018-09-24 17:00:44 But that was not the point of your tweet!? I guess you are one of those who think in capitalist terms: that exclusivity equals value! Not in all things! Communication has become one of the bread and butter commodities, and shouldn't be the privilege of the rich!
129 2018-09-24 17:00:24 It’s quite obvious you haven’t found one yet that doesn’t exploit the Canadian  Consumer. If you think #USDA uses direct subsidies, you know NOTHING of how the American commodities market works. #DFC merely are pigs  at the trough of everyday #Canadians.
130 2018-09-24 16:59:34 The du30 admin is becoming paranoid because of their inability so solve the problems the PH is going through? The rice problem & the continued increase of prices of basic commodities & the inflation rate since they implemented the stupid du30 TRAIN law?
131 2018-09-24 16:56:42 Now the biggest bone of contention. Is dollar weakening good for us. As it will not let crude come down. Then now. Commodities will be elevated then how will CAD come down. Good will fire  if dollar drops. Man congress will corner the govt from everywhere.
132 2018-09-24 16:53:13 Por eso insisto en que hay que concentrar la lucha en bajar las retenciones en vez de pedir que suba el u$s y más con precios de commodities en baja.
La suba del dólar terminará siendo comida por la inflación.

136 2018-09-24 16:44:33 It’s what Marx called the general formula for capital. A capitalist begins with a sum of money (M), buys the means of production and hires workers to produce commodities (C), which are then sold to make a greater sum of money (M’). This is then reinvested in the production...

141 2018-09-24 16:32:32 Isso: cobre é bom indicador de crescimento global forte = demanda forte por materiais básicos =  commodities. Só minha opinião aqui, vamos aguardar o @hbredda

143 2018-09-24 16:25:17 My current solution: trading a single pair in crypto (BTC/USD) alongside traditional markets (forex, commodities).

If BTC correlation decreases and the longer-term alt market trend turns clearly bullish, I’ll consider trading some of the larger caps.
144 2018-09-24 16:21:19 Your slogans was Congress hatao, Modi Lao while petrol , deisel price was low compared crude retes. Now those items are very high & crude oil rates are more than 50% less. People of the Country are suffering on price rise of all commodities. So what harm to say Modi hatao?. Regrt

147 2018-09-24 16:08:04 wouldn't you hope Drucker, who i espouse daily, would revise this if given the opportunity?
great strategies are also part art (dependent upon some science). without art they are just formulas and, yes, commodities.

i do know Napoleon would have disagreed.
148 2018-09-24 16:01:30 No one in the country is a non-taxpayer. We have hundreds of indirect federal and provincial taxes on commodities that is paid even by the most poor people of the society.

151 2018-09-24 15:40:00 In fact I'm amazed you could state that. UK listed Man Group's AHL quant fund is well known to be invested by pension funds. It invests in futures. Including commodities. Honestly  ...

Such commodities are found in Cong only.
153 2018-09-24 15:39:31 #Gold singled out as an #investment can be extremely #dangerous. It's best to be invested in a basket of #commodities instead. That way if the value of one of the commodities plummets, there won't be an as big a #loss than if you're #invested in a single #commodity.
154 2018-09-24 15:37:33 Agreed, but not just taxes but royalties as well, considering the massive differences in prices of copper and cobalt, surely the royalty rates must be different for the two commodities.... this will help invest in capacity to be able to claw back 20%~30% off the value chain....
155 2018-09-24 15:37:23 Even in Agriculture, commodities, in fact in every field. Therefore the national R&D ministry is in high need with massive budget and must run by the professionals. We need only then a PM who really can understand the need of the time.

157 2018-09-24 15:31:47 You have no clue. Large pension funds like the Canadians buy entire companies. Commodities are viewed by some pension funds as an uncorrelated & therefore diversifying asset
158 2018-09-24 15:29:36 Issue on tariffs between USA and China is so bad.anyone knows that your GMO soybean sold to China was with 3% tariff only? Boeing with zero tariff.also big deal of service trade to China from USA. You can check what was tariff rates for imported commodities from China.
159 2018-09-24 15:26:10 Turns out other countries cant print usd to buy. And China doesnt want their stuff or their money. Unless it’s commodities. Then bring it.
160 2018-09-24 15:19:58 Interessante é que a correlação com os lucros também se mantém, o que sugere a conclusão de que só há crescimento de lucros por aqui quando as commodities encontram-se em alta ??

Not unless they were fascists who think working people are commodities and capital, rather than citizens of the 6th richest country in the world.
We are living in a dystopia. The sheeple need to wake the fuck up.

167 2018-09-24 14:57:19 hace un año el café estaba en 130 dólares y el azúcar en 18. en 18 meses ambos commodities han caído 40% y los combustibles subieron 40% y aunque las remesas han subido 12% en el año no compensan los menos dólares que han entrado a Guatemala en ese período.
168 2018-09-24 14:53:34 Water like electricity are essential commodities. They must never be shut off. Find ways to encourage customers pay.
169 2018-09-24 14:47:06 2016 podemos dizer que foi uma crise global das commodities?
170 2018-09-24 14:38:41 Reason they don’t articulate risk is bc MOST, Have zero experience running a fund. Like ZERO!   most are comp Sci guys.   Bc volatility is so high.  You MUST trade (chop - take gains then reapply).  Futures and commodities trade on TA. Token economics are REALLY hard to build.
171 2018-09-24 14:34:12 If true the Wood Mackenzie NPV for 30.4% of Arran on spot commodities is $104m
172 2018-09-24 14:30:22 el día de la presentación en ABG di una pequeña explicación pero si sigue el hilo que publiqué al respecto está la explicación. 14% de incremento en remesas pero caída de 40% de precios de commodities que exporta guatemala y subida de 40% de combustibles genera menos dólares.
173 2018-09-24 14:22:23 Or maybe valuable commodities with a short term financial investment that needs to pay off for both parties involved.
174 2018-09-24 14:19:51 Darned good idea if you ask me, why should the customer be fleeced for the sake of the shareholder. About time our commodities were nationalised. The French successfully nationalised their electric company EDF in 1948 - what is the matter with the British, are we useless?

182 2018-09-24 13:39:19 Cannabis and hash oil are indeed agricultural commodities. Cost of industrial production when it comes to (especially vertical operations in NJ) are not rocket science or terribly expensive. Oil - lab tested - at $1500/lb it's about $3/gram in production. Marked up from there.

184 2018-09-24 13:35:25 "SpaceX’s eye-catching plan also lacks those two most precious of commodities: humility and scientific rigour."
The only depressing thing here is this article...
185 2018-09-24 13:35:04 Yes, neither of which is acceptable. I didn't have time to elaborate,  earlier. They see women as commodities to be used and not as the equal, and often, superior diving forces in our lives.
186 2018-09-24 13:34:05 Estas dictaduras populistas usaron el boom de las commodities. Esos infelices lo atribuyeron a un merito propio. Cuando se acabo el boom, se quedaron con pobreza y sin ahorros. Populismo típico

231 2018-09-24 10:44:27 #Oil crosses $80 a barrel.  Astoria wrote a report earlier this year arguing that most portfolios aren't properly allocated because they don't much #commodities exposure.  Most laughed at us when we wrote the note. 
232 2018-09-24 10:40:46 So, Rotich has defended the controversial tax law & cautioned traders against raising the costs of basic commodities as it will hurt common mwananchi even more. What blunts are these guys on though?

235 2018-09-24 10:19:30 Crude prices cracking fresh post-2014 highs, but oil-based commodities are trading mixed. $CAD is down 0.2% OTD but $NOK continues downtrend.

254 2018-09-24 08:03:52 Yes 6% customs duty.  Set via the 2016 FTA between EU and Vietnam. 
Once UK leaves the EU the same commodity has a 30% customs tariff via WTO. 

Yes the UK can negotiate, but how many years will it take on the millions of commodities sourced via the 750 global trade deals via EU

276 2018-09-24 05:38:09 interesting about petrol money usage. But Sir with due respect increased fuel prices will lead to increase inflation on vegetables and other commodities. Income remaining same for all people, increase in food and others will be too much on citizens of middle class.
