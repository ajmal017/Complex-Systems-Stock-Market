43 2018-05-02 22:12:57 What we didn't need was another (bad) attempt at trying to intellectualize the idea that sex and women are commodities to be distributed to appease men who think sex and women's submission is something they're entitled to.

46 2018-05-02 22:06:54 I find that an effective way to think about incels is to acknowledge that they see women as commodities.  Their focus is on what we "owe" them, and their values do not deserve validation.

49 2018-05-02 21:42:26 So you think that citizens of this country shouldn't have a voice about our overtaxed commodities?
50 2018-05-02 21:38:28 I completely agree with this, especially how people don't have an inherent right to commodities, but, @erinspice, do you agree people also don't have inherent rights to things like healthcare, food, shelter, and education? (Where do we draw the line?)
51 2018-05-02 21:33:38 I’m sorry but it sounds like you’re saying that the mere presence of women makes it their fault that they were treated like commodities?

53 2018-05-02 21:20:37 How about we peaked on earnings and now stocks are correcting.  It’s not that hard to see.  Commodities are going to rally.  Wage pressure.  All leads to lower margins.  Sad but true.

56 2018-05-02 21:16:30 #IdiocyResponse, May 2, 2018. To sum:

Slavery was never a choice.

Women are not commodities, and thus you cannot "redistribute sex" or access to women's bodies. 

Thus concludes today's mini installment of Things You Shouldn't have to Say Aloud.
57 2018-05-02 21:10:03 This would be an acceptable retort if women were commodities or currency, but since we aren’t, it’s not.

61 2018-05-02 20:58:28 @nfl owners view cheerleaders the same as players. Commodities that can be disposed of on a whim with no risk or anything remotely negative
62 2018-05-02 20:54:57 Still surprised at this. What commodities are we talking about here?
63 2018-05-02 20:54:11 Commodities can be securities.

67 2018-05-02 20:42:28 @USDOL @federalreserve Technology continues to increase production/efficiency and drives down the prices of commodities. Is that factored into the CPI? If not then the CPI as a measure of inflation is dramatically skewed and all the more reason the Money Supply is a better metric

69 2018-05-02 20:33:31 'A service performed for money' is almost the definition of a commodity. And commodities always embody social relations. Many commodities (e.g. stocks, patent rights, financial instruments, etc) are nothing but social relations.

74 2018-05-02 20:24:55 Consistent problem with Douthat's "logic": women are sentient autonomous human beings - not commodities for men to use and "redistribute"- he can never quite acknowledge that women possess and are worthy of full person-hood
75 2018-05-02 20:24:14 That's not accurate. It's a claim that has been debunked many times. Besides, there's more to this equation than just body count. Part of the objection is to treating nonhuman animals like products/commodities who can be selectively bred, used, confined, auctioned and slaughtered

86 2018-05-02 19:50:05 Ross @DouthatNYT is as fucking gross as he is stupid.  It's almost impressive how he can find a way to think and speak disgusting nonsense on so many different subjects.  If women are commodities you're suddenly for socialism huh? Fuck OFF you turgid prick.

88 2018-05-02 19:41:37 He frames the question as though it were a discussion of commodities and property; food distribution, e.g. Seeing sexual relations from that perspective eliminates the need for consent, which is likely his intent. Complete garbage start to finish. >>
89 2018-05-02 19:22:16 The big problem is that in e.g. Mormon society, it's used as a way to sexually exploit women and treat them as commodities. I don't have a problem with polygamy as such, but it seems like rolling it out in a way that didn't further existing sexual exploitation would be tricky.
90 2018-05-02 19:18:45 We are glad to hear that. I guess then you are also supportive of a PPP for new transit and commodities infrastructure development supported with the Little City platform.

91 2018-05-02 19:13:58 A week ago a terrorist killed 10 people. Women aren't commodities or property. Onto whose bodies would we allow such a "thought experiment"? This is not about sex. This is about violence.

107 2018-05-02 18:21:50 Economic/scarcity model doesn’t apply. Sex is neither a commodity nor a requirement to live. No inherent right to sex. Scarcity allows degrees of commodities, I.e relative wealth. Sex/no sex is a bright line binary-you either have it or you don’t. This is wrongheaded.

128 2018-05-02 17:44:28 The outlook for #CdnAg is positive, which means we should continue to see an increase in #FarmlandValues in 2018. Bottom line from @JPGervais: “There is strong demand for the commodities we sell.”

133 2018-05-02 17:31:25 Yes, all $ asset classes would be pressured downward, but that sure doesn't mean any given asset is net lower over any given time period. To me, a higher USD is more problematic for commodities, esp' the shiny ones.

Respected sir,wanted to highlight the discrepancies wrto price list of many commodities including petrol / diesel. smaller denomination coins are not in circulation,if a common man puts one litre petrol and pays RS.100/- & petrol is 77.60, he is not getting his 40 PS.

137 2018-05-02 17:25:13 Well, that would be silly, because men's bodies aren't commodities. His "Redistribution of Sex" is predicated on a marketplace where women's bodies are the product and men the consumers as full humans. Douthat to posit that men submit their bodies as a product? Un-possible!

139 2018-05-02 17:21:53 YES. This is lazy, misogynistic provocation masquerading as deep thinking, even though it completely fails to consider and address all the ways in which people's bodies (and desire and willingness and connection) differ from and are NOT commodities to be redistributed.

148 2018-05-02 17:11:30 I’m saying it again because I can’t really get my mind around it:
I never thought it would become acceptable to see this argument. I never thought this argument could survive the editorial process at ANY newspaper. 
I knew sexism was everywhere...but women as *commodities*?
149 2018-05-02 17:11:12 I'm extremely not an expert in the field, but, well, it's different in kind because providing sex work raises consent issues that medical work doesn't, for reasons that don't come from economics.  Bodily autonomy _differs_ and  _matters more_ than commodities.

159 2018-05-02 16:31:07 The absence of tags on commodities from Africa is what enabled conflict diamonds, illicit trades in crude oil, etc. The world must battle the grey markets particularly in Asia where these illicit products are mostly sold.

167 2018-05-02 15:55:14 capitalist don’t care about what’s in the best interest of the working class, they don’t want the working class to become successful and accumulate wealth, the reason why is because capitalist need laborers to produce their products and purchase their commodities.
168 2018-05-02 15:54:12 The inability to differentiate b/n commodities from things which exist outside the marketplace is really the failure to understand there IS a world of things which exist outside the marketplace.

187 2018-05-02 14:56:17 A story as old as commodities.  This is one of the reasons it is so boom bust. It is always a mature mkt, is steep decline, so hated, or a nascent mkt, in steep growth, so loved. Right now it is looking attractive, but FANG continues to be the "risk" play that pays.

235 2018-05-02 11:42:44 It can be more. Prices of commodities are sky rocketing.
236 2018-05-02 11:40:05 @socialepfo Dear sir, I am working with CELEBRUS COMMODITIES LTD SINCE JAN 2012 BUT IN UAN MEMBER SITE ITS SHOWING EXIT ON JUNE 2012 BUT STILL I AM WORKING WITH SAME COMPANY AND COMPANY ALSO DEPOSITING MY PF HOW IT SHOWING WRONG ??
237 2018-05-02 11:30:22 I really wish I could draw their attention similarly towards the unjustified taxation on branded commodities like wheat-flour. But I am not a cabinet-ranked minister. Sigh 
238 2018-05-02 11:25:40 @YahooNoise I have picks 9, 15, 16 in a dynasty startup. Would you take DCook over Barkley? My reasoning would be I've seen Cook perform on an NFL level and the team looks like they'll be good for a few years. Like safer commodities picking that high.
239 2018-05-02 11:22:58 @MikeTagliereNFL I have 9, 15, & 16 in a dynasty startup. Would you take D.Cook over Barkley which I'd consider? I'm kinda partial to known commodities that high. To me Cook has the better situation long term, and I've seen him perform on an NFL level.
240 2018-05-02 11:15:08 Information is a commodity.  It’s meant to be traded.  Like all commodities, it must be traded wisely.
241 2018-05-02 11:10:25 All the respect to your experience and qualification.
I'd appreciate it if you explain this phenomenon briefly.
Does it happened to exceptional cases in commodities earlier? & what were the sociological and/or economical factors that played the role of its emergence of it? #OOTT
242 2018-05-02 11:08:19 wow !! the aussie dollar down that far when we r on the cusp of commodities   rising !!!! any reason for this forecast ?
243 2018-05-02 11:07:04 Nak tanya siket - kenapa kite pengeluar / pengeksport petrol, buah2an tempatan, beras, electronic goods dll, tapi commodities ni tak murah pun? 
244 2018-05-02 11:06:56 Qual a solução?? Eu sei. Reduzir o estado Brasileiro. Industrializar com isenção de 100% dos impostos os nossos commodities, principalmente ferro-gusa, milho, soja, trigo e PETRÓLEO. Fortalecer a industria naval e tomar de volta o mercado de transporte de nossos bens exportados.
245 2018-05-02 10:54:51 "UK bans basic commodities"

But muh "America sucks"
246 2018-05-02 10:41:30 funniest, when commodities are pronounced as "Ban", they proliferate.

Look at Rice, Spaghetti, frozen foods etc.
247 2018-05-02 10:36:34 renationalisation of rail and commodities will certainly be easier out of the EU.
248 2018-05-02 10:26:25 The "owner" who raised him from birth. This headline vilifies the lion. Wild animals are not commodities. Fuck that guy and all those like him.
249 2018-05-02 10:19:53 Yes exactly like the McCann's, to many parents have children and see them as commodities rather than their children, and to leave them alone in a foreign country, well it beggars belief, stupid, naive, irresponsible, piss poor parents ultimately !!!
250 2018-05-02 10:18:48 Note they never ban "bad things". They tax them or set minimum prices. They reserve "bad things", i.e. basic commodities, for themselves. They turn nicotine, alcohol, sugar, transport, electricity, warm homes etc. into luxuries

They pocket the taxes so can afford more of them
251 2018-05-02 10:16:44 As stated previously I find the idea of an "acceptable" mortality rate obscene. "Inevitable" but "avoidable" are more appropriate descriptors. Only ppl who see animals as commodities talk in those terms, and that appalls me
252 2018-05-02 09:56:13 + vehicle, but the boy doesn’t truly mind. Liquor and cigarettes, much like sex, are the commodities bartered around in the prisons of his homeland, and so encountering a form of them is quite nostalgic.

260 2018-05-02 09:16:22 The system at a point became such that communities were trading their own in exchange for commodities the Europeans, Arabs, etc had. For the slaves, they had no choice, but the African nation/Black people were complicit in the whole slavery issue. There were 2 sides to it.

Jews the chosen people without resourses and commodities, therefore sailed to enslave murder and plunder!
277 2018-05-02 06:50:49 Not entirely true. Some were sold by their own relatives for whatever commodities they deemed more valuable. Lets tell the whole truth and not part truths just because it is @kanyewest

279 2018-05-02 06:43:17 The world is a market place to shop for your Aakhirah. You're here with a limited budget (life). The commodities you choose will decide your home in the Hereafter.
280 2018-05-02 06:41:00 It is wholly unsustainable for the commodities to be eating the park owners and/or visitors. As such, they get destroyed.

354 2018-05-02 01:23:43 Concordo!!! Reforçando que o prédio é da uniao e que o PT ficou 13 anos no governo não atuando como deveria na questão, mesmo com "excelente relacionamento" com as empreiteiras.
Perdeu-se uma ótima oportunidade no "boom" das commodities de executar uma política eficiente.
355 2018-05-02 01:17:40 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
356 2018-05-02 01:02:51 What point are you trying to make? Just throwing buzz words out?

Cartels and criminals love prohibition. They don't want legalization, which is the responsible and safest solution for many drugs that are global commodities.
357 2018-05-02 01:00:07 Saying that economics reduces people to commodities is like saying biology reduces people to molecules. Science isn't a philosophy, it's a method for understanding the world we live in.
358 2018-05-02 00:59:45 1/ Without the right of private property, there is nothing extra to be  gained by producing commodities which others value in order to trade for  commodities which the individual values.  Thus, no widespread  exchanging of commodities.  Thus, no widespread indirect exchange.
359 2018-05-02 00:58:24 Companies don't see people as brands they see them as commodities !!!!!!!
360 2018-05-02 00:58:15 Probably - depends how stringent foreign banks get on lending given revelations of the RC. The AUD has been propped up by commodities for a long time so it’s hard to be 100% sure exactly of the outcome.
361 2018-05-02 00:51:24 i need a grabber II. before they become hotter commodities than they are already.

364 2018-05-02 00:44:04 Como você essa dinâmica do DOL se valorizando sobre quase tudo? DXY inverteu tendência... acomodação momentânea apenas? Déficits crescentes, commodities em alta, tax cuts... só vejo razão pro DOL enfraquecer no longo prazo, mas no curto temos isso aí...

368 2018-05-02 00:33:07 phones are cheap commodities.  All this does is subsidize the phone companies.
369 2018-05-02 00:23:49 WallSt traders, living on price swings in commodities are are themselves becoming commodities. Human dealmakers are losing jobs, replaced by AI machines with computer algorithms that react & trade millions of times in a tearful blink. Keeping our eyes closed won't make it stop.

371 2018-05-02 00:15:12 this kind of communal success demands integrity, the most rare of commodities in our current atmosphere.
372 2018-05-02 00:14:22 I agree. Any attempt to produce saleable  commodities is a potential target. Just coz or hasn't happened is no indication of what might or might not happen in the future.
373 2018-05-02 00:04:49 The point of the story is that in 500AD women ARE commodities. The woman is property. She is not consulted and preservation of her dignity is Saudi level doublespeak. Her reputation sets her worth when married. The only dignity being preserved is of the father's wallet. 1/
