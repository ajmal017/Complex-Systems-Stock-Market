Didn't realise there was oil in Myanmar...

8 2018-03-05 23:58:33 It's nuts.  We live in the richest country in the world.  But we spend all our money on bombs and oil pipelines.  But we don't have enough money to feed our children.
9 2018-03-05 23:58:16 It’s interesting reading your defence of the oil business. When you were a MP you took the other side of the argument

26 2018-03-05 23:57:10 all of my newest bundles have a conditioner in it that’s great as a conditioner or a little bit as a leave in. If your hair is really try i suggest golden locks (it’s an oil but a little bit as a leave in is good for really dry hair)

47 2018-03-05 23:54:02 Juicy lamb, feta cheese, kebab, flat bread, dips, lots of olive oil, and the hypnotic smell of cumin.
48 2018-03-05 23:53:53 Only because we are the only country continueing to rely on oil in an age of renewable sources.
49 2018-03-05 23:53:50 UK Gov expected an oil boom too - so did the oil industry. No-one knew what OPEC was planning on doing in the future. if only UK had protected Scotland's economy with an oil fund. There was no China deal, just a memorandum of understanding to discuss possible future deals.
50 2018-03-05 23:53:39 Lmao I still am. I don’t know tbh. I ended up adding a lot of water & scooping out the floating oil (got this idea from you, thanks). 

So the palm oil taste & smell dwindled.
51 2018-03-05 23:53:36 My beard oil comes in tomorrow. Yaaas 
52 2018-03-05 23:53:31 Donald, aren’t a lot of our imports from Canada in the form of oil? China wants Canada’s oil if we don’t take it. I would rather we take/use the oil even if the balance of trade dollars don’t balance out evenly. Thank you.

58 2018-03-05 23:52:32 Clinton ran on a position that methane was a good replacement for coal and oil  (it isn't). And I struggle to forget when the left controlled Congress and the Whitehouse and failed to pass Obama's cap and trade bill. Y'all hardly make climate change an issue on the trail
59 2018-03-05 23:52:23 Harga minyak dijaga tidak akan melambung di atas US$ 100 per barrel  Krn pelajaran Dr yg lalu , bila harga minyak tinggi MK shale oil jd relevan ini yg dihindari produsen oil, shale oil yg skrg aktif adalah investasi lama tp utk shale oil baru dr harga investasi blm kompetitif.

61 2018-03-05 23:51:53 I was so confused by the palm oil saga tho. So the oil was too thick? Or too much?

63 2018-03-05 23:51:35 Use olive oil as a conditioner by leaving it warmed up on your hair for 15 minutes before shampoo.

65 2018-03-05 23:51:00 No use in us arguing over something that will never change, our government is allowing the Oil companies crate Blanche over Canada...... doesn’t matter....I sold my 8cyl Caddy and bought a 4cyl Caddy instead. Fu_k Trudeau and Wynne
66 2018-03-05 23:50:59 S&P's credit rating for Russia was recently upgraded to BBB- (good), the low end of investment grade quality. Putin's stringent economic policies since oil price declines in 2014 have helped him secure a Russian "fiscal fortress" to weather Western sanctions- The Economist
67 2018-03-05 23:50:54 With @realDonaldTrump as president, hate crimes are up, tourists are avoiding the U.S., protected lands are being given to Big Oil, corruption scandals abound, the poor are neglected, & chaos reigns. But we the people will rise up. We'll pray, march, & vote for a better world.

76 2018-03-05 23:49:03 .@WholeFoods Please... stop selling snake oil. Homeopathic remedies are nothing but water or sugar pills. It's shameful that you're profiting off people's ignorance.
77 2018-03-05 23:48:55 From what I’ve heard locally, we are having an issue moving our grain because we can’t move our oil by pipeline. So it is causing the backlogs for our grain transport.
78 2018-03-05 23:48:52 Expect Assad and Iran to try and seize the oil fields in deir ezzor.
79 2018-03-05 23:48:37 I completely agree that violence fosters violence, but that is fairly objective view afforded to many of us who haven’t been in that position. Emotion and rationale are like oil and water, so when someone is angry they aren’t thinking about rational ways to express themselves.
80 2018-03-05 23:48:23 'refiners needs'=process oil that produces more of what the market demands. It's not that shale is 'difficult to process' (actually it's easy) but that it produces less 'desirable product'. Still possible to max. diesel from shale (e.g., dieselization options) but that takes > $$

84 2018-03-05 23:47:32 Last month a friend was in Los Angeles and he was complaining that gas was $2.25 a gallon and BC is now paying $7.30 that’s both in Imperial gallons, that’s crazy and completely price gouging..Oil companies haven’t lost a cent since oil prices dropped in Canada
85 2018-03-05 23:47:22 I’m hoping against hope this “food” is wretched! If this stuff is even semi-palatable we are all screwed! You think it hard to avoid soybean oil now...
86 2018-03-05 23:47:17 Why? It's a waste lol the time u spend changing it and buying the oil is not worth the savings as compared as to just going to the shop
87 2018-03-05 23:47:13 Im not going to add oil to the fire. Promise myself not to tweet anything about Jackson.

91 2018-03-05 23:46:54 My husband made some muffins and substituted coconut oil and Greek yogurt for vegetable oil and sour cream. So proud  Any other RDs that feel like their family members are nutrition pros by proxy? #RDchat #dietitianhusband #nutrition
92 2018-03-05 23:46:27 The prof I spoke to says the PSI index of Evoo and olive oil are about the same. PSI is the parameter used to measure an oil’s sensitivity to breaking down into toxic compounds when heated. I use evoo for everything though.

108 2018-03-05 23:44:16 I don't have the exact proportions, but roughly; 1/4 tsp each of Turmeric & Ginger powder, 1/2 tsp Coconut oil, 1 tsp of Honey, mixed w/hot water - let it steep, then drink like teas each morning and possibly reduces inflammation & increased immune system. I have it each morning.

117 2018-03-05 23:42:38 @kenjilopezalt i just got a bernzomatic for torching my sous vide steaks and i’ve been wondering if i need to worry about accidentally setting the butter and canola oil on fire in my pan. are grease fires a danger when following that recipe of yours?
118 2018-03-05 23:42:37 Cauliflower pieces tossed with a wee bit of olive oil, fresh crushed garlic and sea salt- roasted until nice and crispy just about beats all
119 2018-03-05 23:42:31 In the hospital, I put a little Vick’s under my nose before I’m around the smelly people so it blocks the smell. Even peppermint oil/air humidifier is discreet but powerful lol we literally have them for that reason.

125 2018-03-05 23:41:52 I wish cars didn’t need things like oil changes and tire rotations 
126 2018-03-05 23:41:44 Nope, don’t believe it, why did we have enough refining capacity when oil was $133 a bar, now we don’t ...it’s never going to end.
127 2018-03-05 23:41:20 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
128 2018-03-05 23:41:11 It's way easier to just not check the oil ever, problem solved

134 2018-03-05 23:40:14 Well said, roll on the dissolution. The Angloteers could not give a rats behind about NI. Or Scotland, save its tax revenues from Oil, Gas, Food & Whisky. Those bitter wee people in Ulster need to realise if they really want to be British, they need to move to England.
135 2018-03-05 23:39:49 Loblaw overcharges for bread, big uproar and they give money back, oil companies have been overcharging for years, get a pass! BS!

142 2018-03-05 23:39:03 The amount of niggas I’ve asked to teach me how to change my own oil and they didn’t know how to do it is unreal
143 2018-03-05 23:39:01 Its complex but the advice I got was olive oil or lard - but don’t reuse them. Coconut oil least likely to break down into toxic compounds - but you have flavour /saturated fat issues. Olive oil all the way for me.
144 2018-03-05 23:38:56 The Wall Street Journal reports that “the U.S. will overtake Russia to become the world’s largest oil producer by 2023."
145 2018-03-05 23:38:53 @steeletalk We get our oil from Alberta? Really. I thought our gas prices are impacted “more” from Washington state. Am I wrong?
146 2018-03-05 23:38:48 Bago mo sbhan na nakaka turn off ang isang tao, lagi mong tatandaan, yung mga panahong naglalagay ka pa ng baby oil sa katawan mo. Willing to do just about anything for screams. 
147 2018-03-05 23:38:46 My mom is all about natural oil remedies and she just gave me some and now my sinuses are all kinds of fucked up
148 2018-03-05 23:38:30 California and New York pinkos are flocking here to try to ruin our economy the same way they ruined the places they're leaving. It's a shame.
149 2018-03-05 23:38:19 Pino Solanas, conoce muy bien el tema del petroleo (recuerden cuando lo balearon en el menemato) y el sabe muy bien que no existen reservas ya que este gobierno vendio/regalo  todo...porque creen uds que vino Rex Tillerson (ExxonMobil-ex Standard Oil Co.)
150 2018-03-05 23:38:13 My thoughts on that are basically lol nope. This sem had hydrocarbon oil due to previous life doing a lot of eds on stuff containing very specific amounts silicone.

152 2018-03-05 23:38:03 How can you say Sunday dinner isn't healthy???!??? Steamed vegetables, roast potatoes in olive oil and roast chicken. Yes Yorkshire pudding but overall it is healthy, plus isn’t it supposed to be a balanaced diet.
153 2018-03-05 23:38:02 In other words sell your grandmother to have a great deal with Oil Rich Saudi - good British morals
154 2018-03-05 23:37:50 16 cents a litre, really?? Come on......all you do is toe the line for oil companies, collusion amongst them is sickening, but nobody admits it. Just keep making excuses......there’s no justification for anyone in Canada paying $7.30 a gal when USA pays $2
155 2018-03-05 23:37:44 Your fulfillment is greatly expressed by the beautiful depictions you put on canvas with brush and oil. All of your scenes give the viewer a sense of being there on the beach, all very beautiful.

158 2018-03-05 23:37:33 famous chef boss is in town and last night she made a salad for part of fam meal in ehich straight garlic oil was used as a dressing
159 2018-03-05 23:37:25 WHAT????? For real??? I am not a big fan of egusi, except I add a lot of vegetable and palm oil. Me that i don't even like gbegiri mixed with my beloved ewedu..u people shouldn't spoil ewedu for me o..ewedu and amala is my best food
160 2018-03-05 23:37:04 Might be the only person in the world afraid of falling into the oil change pit.... 
161 2018-03-05 23:36:53 It seems kind of like turning sugar into napalm

I don't mind working with frying oil so much, it gets pretty hot but wipes/drips off easily. Something as hot as fryer oil that sticks relentlessly to the skin? Nope nope nope

(I'm sure it's not that hazardous in practice)
162 2018-03-05 23:36:32 if you say global warming - meltdown. Say AI - recovery!
163 2018-03-05 23:36:25 Not hard at all.  But then they'd have to actually be a journalist

166 2018-03-05 23:36:04 Not a chance! They are going OUT of their way to bury green energy! Their profit center is oil.
167 2018-03-05 23:35:52 I wear that oil all the time
168 2018-03-05 23:35:46 Congratulations on exploiting Mother Earth for stock holders of Big Oil.
169 2018-03-05 23:35:29 Oil, Steel, farming, ranching and mining must all be priority 1 and American products exported across the globe and used here i  ghe USA again. Stop importing and start exporting.
170 2018-03-05 23:35:20 Mine is for sensitive skin, there are few range yg suitable with your skin yg u boleh pilih. Oil cleansing dia mild, so i guess it should b ok after u use cleansing form to clean it lepastu
171 2018-03-05 23:35:19 RT DavidLenigas: Heid_oil Artemis_ARV edward_mead Check out the gold grades at Weeriana that we are going to hit hard with drilling and the Nickel/Copper and Cobalt grades at Ruth Well. Now I’m really exited. Plus 47 Patch work and estimated plant operating costs at Radio Hill.
172 2018-03-05 23:35:16 if someone wants to buy me a new oil diffuser since mine broke and ship it to me that’d be solid 
173 2018-03-05 23:35:14 @iturquhart Let's get serious about #climatechange and cut demand so that KM & 100 other pipelines across the globe are sitting empty in 10 years. Divest from fossil fuels, sue Big Oil for climate denial, invest in & build the low-carbon economy.
174 2018-03-05 23:35:00 As healthy as I want to eat to lose fat/ gain muscle it’s damn near impossible when all they serve are fried foods, food with a lot of oil, or just plain inedible. I could eat a healthy salad, but I’m not eating some lettuce that’s almost as brown as me 
175 2018-03-05 23:34:53 Texas is actually turning a lot more purple than people realize. Of course there is still the Texas culture of "guns, gold, Murica," but Texas is not an easy red state anymore. This can be attributed to the influx of Californians and the Hispanic population. /polisci major

180 2018-03-05 23:33:47 Yes I have so I'm speaking from experience. I was working a double shift at the oil refinery and couldn't get an energy drink but there were candy vending machines in every break room out there so I bought 6 Reese's cup packs and ate all 12 cups to work the last 2 hours.
181 2018-03-05 23:33:30 Good boy!
182 2018-03-05 23:33:28 Fuck I hate cooking with oil. Ouch.
183 2018-03-05 23:32:56 I hope you can get it legalized here in NJ but, reading all the ocean and monmouth county politicians and freeholders comments, its not gonna happen. I need it for the cbd oil for back pain. Whoopie has a great product for us women but cant sell it here till its legal.
184 2018-03-05 23:32:54 Is rapeseed not ok now?Use a lot as supposed better at higher temp than olive oil.What wld you use for occasional deep frying,ie tempura?Hope yr feeling better.x
185 2018-03-05 23:32:49 Okay, you may already know this but a lot of people don’t, castor oil works but you can’t just slap it on. You want to give the area with the oil a nice, thorough massage, really rub it on. At least five minutes.
186 2018-03-05 23:32:49 Coconut oil makes me break out :(

189 2018-03-05 23:32:40 They wanted to create a separate country with #US help, instead #Kurds #SDG #SDF got separated from their own dream home in #Afrin with US help. They wanted te oil in #DeirEzzor n bcoz of that they r nw homeless

196 2018-03-05 23:31:40 You letting another man change your girls’ car engine oil???? Yea couldn’t be me 
197 2018-03-05 23:31:30 Yay!  I believe it was an Oil of the Week in the pinned post in Oil + Co if you want to learn more about using it and what it does. I would’ve written it out but getting to the post office was a now or never situation 
198 2018-03-05 23:31:20 Yes! Sound bytes and lies! I’d rather a little white lie to rally a base up over lies to cover up murders, war crimes etc! I’d prefer no lies at all. But we know that won’t happen. HRC & BHO both are just as guilty, well more in some cases. Overthrowing regimes etc blood for oil!
199 2018-03-05 23:31:16 For you I pour it out. 
I pour, I pour it out for you. 
Praise like oil. 
We will worship's like oil will never not be felt.
200 2018-03-05 23:31:14 Putin wanted Tillerson because his company Exxon had a major deal with Russia's largest oil company that could not proceed until Obama's Russian sanctions were lifted.
201 2018-03-05 23:31:14 The meme that I commented on was questioning the approval process and the ability to economically move oil. The process has been made stricter so that spills do not happen. Sure the previous government approved a few pipelines, but there have been accidents associated with them.
202 2018-03-05 23:31:13 The reason gas prices have jumped is because the Chevron refinery is down in Burnaby. The other refineries in Alberta and Prince George are running at full capacity, and no new pipelines are planned to ship their product to the west coast (KM only ships oil, not gas).
203 2018-03-05 23:31:05 Is NBC news just pretending to be that dumb or are they really that dumb?
204 2018-03-05 23:31:04 @iturquhart Show me global oil demand dropping to "only" 60M bpd by next year, and I'll join in protesting the KM expansion. But demand is currently 95 million bpd; it WILL come out of the ground somewhere. KM safer, more efficient than rail.
205 2018-03-05 23:31:04 Taking my mf caster oil BITCH I need that lmfao
206 2018-03-05 23:30:50 Lol im PRETTY sure ive been getting swindled on oil changes cause i just got one that was WAY cheaper and they didnt tell me i needed an extra quart of oil

209 2018-03-05 23:30:15 Left a pan with oil on the stove for too long. Covered with aluminium foil. Which caved in. Aluminium foil is a great wick.
210 2018-03-05 23:30:09 I feel embarrassed  but I’ll make it up to you. All I need is a peppermint, some coconut oil and a scrunchy
211 2018-03-05 23:30:00 Hi, @Billyandthechix
Are your chicken /chips fried in the same oil as the pork ribs?
212 2018-03-05 23:29:23 Happy Birthday Pastor Joel. May your oil never run dry. I am a testimony of your blessing.
213 2018-03-05 23:29:23 Never tried oil, just got into acrylics last year for stress relief and haven't painted for a while now.. Have jumped a bit into digital as well, but I feel my art looks better done in traditional, maybe for lack of experience in digital ^^
214 2018-03-05 23:29:16 1 chicken roasted and broccoli and carrots cooked with a little olive oil and covered with mixed herbs, tasty and cheap enough any chicken left over for a stir fry the next day with any of the veg.
215 2018-03-05 23:29:16 You are a member in good standing of the anti-American democratic party that is firmly against economic growth & energy independence. Could doesn't mean will or is. If there is no oil out there there will be no drilling.
216 2018-03-05 23:29:15 Believe it or not I like regulations that keep pesticides out of my food. And harmful chemicals and heavy metals out of my air. And oil off of my beaches and wetlands. 
I don’t like when 86% of tax cuts go to the highest bidders.
217 2018-03-05 23:29:05 An oil change?

220 2018-03-05 23:28:41 Google what oil and it's derivatives do for us.   Plastic.   Roads. Pharmacuticles, then maybe you will understand
221 2018-03-05 23:28:36 Time to keep all our oil for oil-independenc now-future?!?

“It is not a contradiction between being a big producer of oil and gas and having ambitious climate policies.” — Terje Soviknes, Norway’s Minister of Petroleum and Energy
227 2018-03-05 23:27:48 Great Again: The United States is set to surpass Russia as the world's number one oil producer in a few years, in large part due to President Trump's energy policies. #foxnews #MAGA

233 2018-03-05 23:26:41 Be thankful you have oil, since you have never invented or made anything. Since it's inception only 1% of all the Nobel prizes have been won my a muslim
234 2018-03-05 23:26:34 Much better argument than not needing oil, imo.
235 2018-03-05 23:26:12 The color or the oil?
236 2018-03-05 23:26:02 Need a oil change bruh
237 2018-03-05 23:26:01 making curry and accidentally had some oil on the burner and almost died of smoke inhalation.
238 2018-03-05 23:25:41 Oh, that is pretty specific. As specific as you can get in economics. It's the difference between public healthcare (like the NHS) or public property of basic materials (like Norway owns its oil) and the belief that total freedom of enterprise is better. Specific it is.
239 2018-03-05 23:25:22 Hey Ricky, Have you noticed that Steel & Aluminum tariffs is hurting the oil&gas industry? I mean, i don't care about Big oil but you guys are confusing. You r supposed to be on the same side of the fence, for christ sake. It's crazy... US will overpay your ignorance
240 2018-03-05 23:25:06 Just dropped $1300 for a damn tune up, after spending $200 on an oil change. My next car will be an old ass Honda
241 2018-03-05 23:25:05 Thank you! Yeah I got it from Amazon for like $9. We got big olive oil bottle from Costco so it needs a home.
242 2018-03-05 23:25:01 Dan doesn’t know shit, doesn’t do shit. Can he explain why gas is 1.62, when oil is $62 a barrel and when oil was $133 a barrel we were paying $1.33?????

It’s like in Canada the oil prices never went down

251 2018-03-05 23:24:08 Kyle europe'll not just take it. We and the rest of the world will fight back. The EU is going to target manufaturers in red states. Tariff on endproducts which'll cost more bc u've a tariff on a raw material. Its like a tariff on oil. Luv ur vids brother, but ur wrong this time.
252 2018-03-05 23:23:36 Well, a lot of actors are getting accused of molestation now.
253 2018-03-05 23:23:31 Oil companies; nah, instead of spending our profits on exploration and retrieval of nat resources we'll just spend it on stock buybacks.  Besides, it's much easier to steal ME oil.

257 2018-03-05 23:22:58 Ima have your body smelling like you dipped in baby oil
258 2018-03-05 23:22:48 The oil is a reason, but another equally shit reason is to flip Syria into Saudi Arabia's/Gulf orbit instead of letting it remain in Iran's orbit. It's also to eliminate one of Israel's staunchest adversaries
259 2018-03-05 23:22:46 I found castor oil very thick and went to Klingon bloodwine (coconut oil) and so far so good 
260 2018-03-05 23:22:31 Bio oil and that Dove baby soap really like my face. 
261 2018-03-05 23:22:26 Some day. Did you ever find a good solvent for this thing? I'm putting DC 704 silicone oil back in, so this shouldn't happen again. Hopefully. This SEMs service record shows it had its dif pump back stream a few times, which definitely scares me.

Please explain what Scotland and Venezuela have in common.
264 2018-03-05 23:22:06 GOOD. We also need to go all other energy sources and deplete the dependence on oil, obviously not altogether, but it would help. And be decent PR... not that PR is the only reason. @POTUS
265 2018-03-05 23:21:59 Well, first there would have to be oil off the coast of Oregon for someone to drill. Which there isn't. But keep on fearmongering for votes.
266 2018-03-05 23:21:51 Inventories are much tighter than the consensus believes. USA shale may be the perceived winner short term (before 2023) but the global economy will be hit hard when oil hits $140 and opec just feeds the ducks...

272 2018-03-05 23:20:42 US EPA, it’s all Pruitt’s fault. He’s the oil, gas & coal guy. Thinks more of his buddies than the country. He must be fired for dereliction of duty! The man is an idiot making money hand over fist abusing our lands and waterways.

As an economist I will say so-called “big oil“ has done more for the human condition than the entire sum of the contributions of every progressive who has ever lived. Just imagine the country, the world, had big oil never existed.

434 2018-03-05 23:00:02 Looking forward to my legislation in Committees this week and next: HB18-1242 is being heard on Wednesday (which modifies salary categorizations for certain counties) and HB18-1157 is being heard on March 14 (which aims to increase reporting of oil and gas incidents).
435 2018-03-05 23:00:02 No I think most do it for Rts. Those who do it for the sake of correction actually have a different approach.
436 2018-03-05 22:59:46 That’s because the rest of the modern world is moving on from oil, you ignoramus. Do you do ANY research before you post this crap?

452 2018-03-05 22:57:06 right after I got called a fucking idiot for not carrying bottled oil in store, some woman calls and starts legit screaming and CRYING to me on the phone because she hasn’t gotten her shoes yet and also bc she doesn’t know her neighbors ???
453 2018-03-05 22:57:04 I felt like putting a bullet between the eyes of every Panda that wouldn't screw to save its species. I wanted to open the dump valves on oil tankers and smother all those French beaches I'd never see. I wanted to breathe smoke.

454 2018-03-05 22:56:47 Saudi Arabia is oil rich country and have mammoth amounts of disposable income. If the UK does extend its trade partnership with them, I do wonder to what cost for the UK, especially as the Govt is resorting to desperate measures in order to assure trade post brexit.

459 2018-03-05 22:55:55 CA Senate gives final approval to AJR 29, a #CALeg resolution opposing new offshore oil drilling. Bipartisan vote in both houses. Said @SenHannahBeth on Trump's offshore oil plan: "This is unsafe, it is irrational, it is unnecessary and in this instance, it is purely vindictive.”
460 2018-03-05 22:55:43 trump and putin are partners in an international criminal mafia style enterprise. They mean to reap the oil/resources and anything else they can to put money in their own pockets while being paid by taxpayers and use our troops and policies to help them.
461 2018-03-05 22:55:38 I find irony here. Lamar Hunt is an icon for the MLS, but was the son of an oil tycoon using his daddy's money to buy sports teams. He even moved the Dallas Texans AFL team to Kansas City and made them the Chiefs.

474 2018-03-05 22:53:43 State Senate votes to oppose federal proposal to allow additional oil drilling off the California coast, which @SenHannahBeth of Santa Barbara called “unsafe, irrational and vindictive.”
475 2018-03-05 22:53:35 It's pretty obvious he's getting advice from people who are only interested in burning as much coal, oil, and gas as possible. Following that path is like willfully steeping in front of an onrushing train.
476 2018-03-05 22:53:35 I just like when gej followers deliberately change narratives to make themselves happy.

He left PMS at N97, how much was it before he took over

How many banks closed door during his govt

How much did we sell oil

How much was out debt before him and how much after

477 2018-03-05 22:53:20 Yea if you use synthetic oil they coming for your pockets.
478 2018-03-05 22:52:56 Please explain why the Liberals are so indignant about the tariffs but stall the building of pipelines to get a market price for oil in Alberta #pnpcbc Seems like we are OK with trade wars within Canada but not with US.

485 2018-03-05 22:51:38 Socialism has not killed anyone in Venezuela there corrupt government and the fall in oil price and a failure to diversify there economy is what has caused it also opec countries refusal to cut supply that kept oil prices so low is at fault not socialism #Toriesout
486 2018-03-05 22:51:34 I love when I schedule an appointment and it’s not honored! I love waiting over an hour to get my oil changed! It’s the best! Today is great! 
487 2018-03-05 22:51:26 Where is all this oil going?  Reminds me of the so called oil shortage of the '70s.  The government didn't know how much oil we had then and I don't believe they know now.  Just too many spots in the world to hide it.

499 2018-03-05 22:49:52 You are on the losing side of history your insane behavior is a detriment to society and the world.

500 2018-03-05 22:49:34 Not only that, but you are going to see a declining life expectancy  in the United States because of financial difficulties and a declining health and human service sector. This is coming about because of wars that benefit bankers, oil companies, etc.

510 2018-03-05 22:49:00 Beeswax lotion is great because it stays on your skin and is super protective.

Coconut oil is super great for literally everything, would bathe in it. It soaks in quickly and is very good for your skin.

If anything maybe apologize to them for our #Shithole President’s mouth.
516 2018-03-05 22:48:20 So your argument is it's oil for kids, but it's really not oil. Do you even think about these things comprehensively, Matt, or is it just lousy stream of consciousness? Oops. #utpol
517 2018-03-05 22:48:15 What reasons of 2014?
Vote No to remain in the EU?
Vote No for shipbuilding, Oil's running out, CC investment, renewables  investment, DWP jobs, "Scotland should lead, not leave the UK", The  Vow...?
These reasons were all garbage and you should genuinely know it!

522 2018-03-05 22:47:38 Exactly. Though to be fair, I’d eat brisket from NYC before I ate sushi from OK. God’s chosen people can at least do a nice brisket, while I’m not too eager for the OK Roll, with catfish wrapped in cotton in a crude oil glaze.

524 2018-03-05 22:47:05 Try using coconut oil in your cooking. It has a lower smoke rate so cook at a lower temp when using it. Also lean meats like chicken and fish. If it comes in a box it's prob bad for ya. ;-)
525 2018-03-05 22:46:47 Of course!  I’ll add a little coconut oil...decadent.

527 2018-03-05 22:46:36 You mean Tim Osman? Been working under Bush's CIA since 70's.  Bin Laden family also Bush's Oil business partner. We know his role. How we know BL really killed?

537 2018-03-05 22:45:08 I remember Opec 1988 the predecessor of MBS (forget his name, deputy oil minister) bought the entire press corps drinks. He had a gorgeous companion. I asked her who she worked for. “Merrill Lynch.” Which office? “Davies St” she said with a smile.

544 2018-03-05 22:44:13 Whatever Kurds do, Turkey will finish its operation in Afrin. Get over it. Otherwise they are risking US support which is crucial for Kurdish existence in Syria. Russia & Assad wants all, oil, territory and revenge on that side of the river.

547 2018-03-05 22:43:26 Olive oil and lemons are often used as base for salad dressings and dips.  Humus (ground chick peas), mutabel (eggplant dip) and garlic paste with a variety of flat bread (pita, saj, persian khubus) are just appetizers, but they're enough to fill a hungry stomach.
548 2018-03-05 22:43:24 @BillNye please ask @JustinTrudeau to show us the science on their approvals of Tar Sands pipelines Kinder Morgan and Line 3 plus this government supports kxl and BP drilling for oil off the coast of Nova Scotia #ShowUstheScience !!
549 2018-03-05 22:43:24 So like u freeze then throw yourself in boiling oil? 
550 2018-03-05 22:43:22 So you think selling off the state oil company was a good idea. How did not selling it off affect Norway?  The gas, the railways, BT. People under thirty can't afford a home now. Tories asset stripping the country for far right tax avoiding business people. They are just thieves.
551 2018-03-05 22:43:18 For anyone interested go Asian. Heat up some oil with garlic, ginger, and scallions (or onions) throw in the green beans. Add salt, soy sauce, or teriyaki as you prefer.

556 2018-03-05 22:42:48 “We think you’re going to see so much change in the classic oil and gas space,” said Maynard Holt, CEO of Tudor, Pickering, Holt and Co. “But while you’re doing all that evolution, you’re also going to see the right path forward on revolution.” #CERAWeek18
557 2018-03-05 22:42:22 But also make sure to do it around the weekend. That way you have a chance they did an oil change.
558 2018-03-05 22:42:22 Need oil??
559 2018-03-05 22:42:09 Possum --Still wanting that EXXON -RUSSIAN oil deal!
560 2018-03-05 22:42:08 It's a very good system...the garlic will liquify in the pan with just a little oil.
561 2018-03-05 22:42:07 Yeah, I'm sure there is. Time/cost of figuring that out though... I am replacing this hydrocarbon oil with silicone oil that won't burn like this though, so it won't happen again.
562 2018-03-05 22:42:06 Why you ain’t put lotion/body oil on....?
563 2018-03-05 22:42:05 Since I paid like $80 this morning for an oil change 
564 2018-03-05 22:41:57 A life where I could be all up in she pokey hole then she makes oil down after now thats life 
565 2018-03-05 22:41:53 The victory won't make me forget how shitty we were
566 2018-03-05 22:41:53 Just listened to a currently serving fed say on tv that she arrests people for possession of cannabis, depite buying illegal cannabis oil for her son with a brain tumor. Its a sensitive subject and obvs you would do anything for ya kid but the hypocrisy is undeniable.
567 2018-03-05 22:41:30 my least favorite culinary thing just became searing meat. that crap is scary and hot oil doesn't feel too great.
568 2018-03-05 22:41:20 McDavid shouldn’t have gone so graciously to Oilers who’ve been a decade long train wreck! Oil town chews up & spits out Top Players
569 2018-03-05 22:41:14 Hell yes. I have an evening booking and after imma take a shower and coconut oil up my ENTIRE BODY.
570 2018-03-05 22:41:12 Rex Tillerson comes to mind. Russia, oil, etc. At the time i suspected that exact same thing! Trump could have just as easily picked his golf caddy for the job. Who makes this stuff up?

572 2018-03-05 22:41:06 BS, i personally know 100's of cannabis users who have smoked it for decades and ALL have black lung...only oil and eating is OK to use, 

smoking it through the lungs DOES KILL YOU.

pure and simple FACTS .......!!!!!
573 2018-03-05 22:41:00 *cough* Lobbyists *coughs* Big oil *coughs* bribes

It's mighty dusty in here
574 2018-03-05 22:40:58 Sorry if this is unwelcome, but have you tried a beeswax-based lotion or coconut oil?
575 2018-03-05 22:40:51 Tudor Pickering’s Maynard Holt: New world is opening through technology revolution in oil and gas; TPH investing more resources to understand technology implications, created energy technology practice #Ceraweek
576 2018-03-05 22:40:43 My issue is AJW wants battery power but fails to realize what must be done to achieve.  Lots of steel, concrete, oil, and copper needed to get these recourses out of the ground.
577 2018-03-05 22:40:39 I have eczema and had it on my face all through my childhood, best thing I used was Oilatum cream (and the bath oil). I only used it at night though because it was really thick and greasy. I also had a ton of steroid creams that weren't meant to go on my face but I did anyway

579 2018-03-05 22:40:24 We made guac in Spanish class today and no one knew how to properly cut the avocadoalso they added olive oil and garnish like u don’t need some fucking garnish for guac
580 2018-03-05 22:40:19 it's poisonous rapeseed oil  you can call it canola to hide it but it is still poisonous
581 2018-03-05 22:40:18 Yesss. I refused to oil cleanse because I got water down my arms ONCE lmao. $4 later I have two sweatbands and can wash my face in peace.
582 2018-03-05 22:40:15 Sad am built schools and universities and the country was literate and prospering and the infrastructure next to nOne... he was not giving the oil so easily and out he went... please don’t compare...

584 2018-03-05 22:40:14 Ohh for gods sake. A bunch of economic fatheads coupled with an arrogant pigheaded thick from Kilkenny came up with a great wheeze on the polluter pays principle. Something designed for mining spoil pits, oil spills and chemical explosions deployed on the poor. Gobshites.
585 2018-03-05 22:40:11 Brilliant...listened earlier about copper on your previous tweet. All very interesting.
586 2018-03-05 22:40:10 If you want the swamp drained in little more than a year, I think upon reflection, you'd agree.  If you want us to lead the WORLD in oil production , it's already begun with President Trump and when he starts something it will get done before end First TERM
587 2018-03-05 22:40:08 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.

590 2018-03-05 22:39:54 The most deadly extractive industry, second to nuclear, known to man ... people, communities, land and waterways all become toxic. Shale oil and gas must never be allowed anywhere. #renewables #beyondcoalandgas
591 2018-03-05 22:39:50 I am guessing not very. Have never smelled it. But was acquainted with hash oil for a bit in the 70s in Spain lol and was very strong
592 2018-03-05 22:39:41 Got some headache oil on my temples because it’s been a heavy ass week.
593 2018-03-05 22:39:36 There was no more oil in the house, nor were there any candles.（家にはもう油がなく、ろうそくもありませんでした。）
594 2018-03-05 22:39:35 Could be,that we are just plain regular nice folks! We are polite and look after our fellow citizens...no one has ever filed bankruptcy in this country over non-payment of medical costs. Imagine if we shut off the water and the oil headed south

598 2018-03-05 22:39:02 It all comes down to being able to do stuff (“Alexa: turn on wnyc; ...set a timer for 25 minutes; ...add olive oil to shopping list.”)while your hands are a mess from cooking. No more salmonella on the iPhone!
599 2018-03-05 22:39:00 Oo I’ve never used Almond oil for body/face. I might try it on my body
600 2018-03-05 22:38:48 Will @realDonaldTrump impeachment day become an international holiday? #TrumpRussia or will he be able to continue on his path of becoming a dictator and eventually invade Canada’s for our oil reserves.  Haha or not haha
601 2018-03-05 22:38:47 It may be a placebo affect but I love driving my car after a fresh oil change.  Feels smoother and accelerated sooner.
602 2018-03-05 22:38:42 I need to get a oil change, car wash, and go grocery shopping today after work.  yaaayyy!

606 2018-03-05 22:37:55 @Breezin12  Needs a little more Oil Baroness!!!  As you can tell, I DO have an Oil Fetish.  At least that's ONE of them.  :)
607 2018-03-05 22:37:25 god tier canola oil there I said it
608 2018-03-05 22:37:11 Rex & Vlad have sooo much in common: BIG, BIG money riding on BIG BIG oil contract.
609 2018-03-05 22:37:01 The fact that I spent $525 on brake pads and oil change is a good indication that today was nothing else but productive. 
610 2018-03-05 22:36:59 Yes they are. I use oregano and thyme a lot ... mixed in coconut or olive oil
611 2018-03-05 22:36:40 @ToyotaConicelli my son bought his car at your used car dealership in December 2017. It was under repair for 6 weeks.. it's back and still has an oil leak... same one from when he bought it.  What gives??
612 2018-03-05 22:36:26 So Glad I'm not the only one...so sorry there are So many Americans buying his snake oil...the repercussions are deadly
613 2018-03-05 22:36:18 It's a leafy green. You chop the stems and sautee those w shallots and garlic and some oil, then toss the leaves and cherry tomatoes until wilted and red pepper flakes, top w parmesan
614 2018-03-05 22:36:06 At the dealer getting an oil change, tire rotation, etc. They've already tried to push a $100 alignment, claiming my front tires are out of alignment. 

They also tried pushing the $210 maintenance package. 

I think I might go elsewhere next time, because fucking fuck.
615 2018-03-05 22:35:53 No shower needed. Dab of beard oil will do me.  #BadHygieneTips
616 2018-03-05 22:35:45 Tundra getting that oil change right now before we hit rocky point 
617 2018-03-05 22:35:42 Exxon has spilled more oil than anyone on the planet. Since "Corp's are now PEOPLE", what would happen if WE spilled millions of gallons of toxic oil, polluting the ocean? #JailExxon #ClimateChangeIsReal
618 2018-03-05 22:35:38 So, it's Official:

#PKK stops fighting against #ISIS in #Euphrates East Bank & will change stance to "Defensive positioning".

ISIS ad Eternum

Perfect excuse for #USA stay in #Syria as expected...not that US need an excuse after got the Oil & be so close to cut Syria from Iraq.
619 2018-03-05 22:35:37 it's your pimp daddy Putin and Iran who signed oil/gas deals in exchange for defending Assad's sorry ass.
620 2018-03-05 22:35:36 my mom was complaining about the coconut oil I use for my hair and I was like “anything that doesn’t smell like Chanel bothers you”

625 2018-03-05 22:34:51 Drink a lot of oil, Ian?
626 2018-03-05 22:34:43 @realDonaldTrump American Steel is moving along @ its own speed . Except Steel Dynamics which has properly adjusted to the market conditions . Unlike the whiners in the rest of the industry . Whiners should have to explain y producing steel for Oil Drilling is not Important !!!
627 2018-03-05 22:34:40 Medium roasts also are best for espresso machines -- especially superautomatics. Very dark roasts with a lot of oil can damage the internal grinder so stick with a nice medium (city) roast.
628 2018-03-05 22:34:37 Eat more greens and get more iron in... Also relax for a bit and oil them, you're too young for knee problems
629 2018-03-05 22:34:25 Baby oil works wonders!!!
630 2018-03-05 22:33:58 i use a lot of them..  peppermint oil and tea tree 2 of my favorites ...also happen to be incredibly toxic to cats.

651 2018-03-05 22:31:16 After 50 years of pretend unity a president buhari can still be bold enough to say 'AN ATRACK ON BOKO HARAH IS AN ATTACK ON THE NORTH' 
Where was the 'unity,faith peace and progress' you speak of when 90% of oil blocks belong NOT to the indigenous people of the south but north
652 2018-03-05 22:31:08 Sometimes simple is good. Try cooking crushed tomatoes on some white fish, add salt pepper, serve with roasted veggies which I add 2 tbl olive oil and some salt to while it's cooking and lay the fish in a bed of brown basmati rice. Easy meal that taste great.

THAT is what keeps them happy.

662 2018-03-05 22:30:22 Tip of the Day:  Unlike brined olives like Kalamatas, oil-cured olives have a meatier bite because they're coated in salt then macerated  in oil.  Look for them on olive bars or with other Italian products.
663 2018-03-05 22:30:10 intern: there's no oil left it's all gone!

669 2018-03-05 22:28:28 ... if it still requires a large amount of oil to produce however many petawatts of energy you quoted which the latest turbines produce, is it really green? Especially if nothing is going to change in how those are produced. Same goes for the solar energy. (2/2)

674 2018-03-05 22:26:51 Add the easements AK gvt needs to make new oil pipelines or offshore drilling, there isn't 23,000 per village lands available in SE Alaska. Majority of lands is mainland Alaska. 

Doesn't address fishing & hunting or water rights. Just surface. Minerals not mentioned either.
675 2018-03-05 22:26:40 If it's cut very finely and seared quickly in good nut oil, it's quite edible. Horrid when overcooked and chewy, tho.

679 2018-03-05 22:26:15 I was just about to reply the same thing about Lego’s plant-based plastic; it’s not sourced from oil, which renders it un-recyclable yet just as indestructible... They need to recycle, turning old Lego (or other plastic) into new Lego, otherwise it’s just adding to the problem.
680 2018-03-05 22:26:06 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for Thou art with me; Thy rod and Thy staff they comfort me.
Thou prepare a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: Thou anoint my head with oil; my cup run over.

683 2018-03-05 22:25:48 You canceled DACA with an executive order ya dummy. Now you want to blame others. By the way the steel thing you're doing means Big$$$$ for Russian oil but you probably knew that having so many private Putin meetings. @JoeNBC @SenatorCollins @chucktodd @PRyan
684 2018-03-05 22:25:47 I’ve had the coconut oil on for 22 hrs and it started to irritate my scalp bc it couldn’t BREATHE I slabbed it on so thick. My hair seems better... but it is blonde as hell
685 2018-03-05 22:25:45 Surprisingly, few presentations I’ve sat through have gone as far back as the Romans industrialising olive oil production to help supply its trade and troops on a near global scale, thus changing the lives of nearly all the world’s population at the time...
686 2018-03-05 22:25:32 Yay! I am so happy to hear that! Your addition to sesame oil sounds fantastic too!! 
687 2018-03-05 22:25:11 Stop bigotry, Dr Mutua. The silence that met Ngilu's offensive incitement should apply everywhere. I am a Kamba and not an inch offended by Ikamba. People who live in glass houses don't throw stones. Separate emotions from responsibility!
688 2018-03-05 22:25:11 My guess: protecting gas, oil and Daesh. Creating a buffer with Iran that can house US bases. But I'm a cynic.
689 2018-03-05 22:25:09 Motor oil is a surprisingly effective substitute for hair gel. #BadHygieneTips

692 2018-03-05 22:24:58 We currently have 4 million barrels per day of oil pipelines in Canada. That is hardly stopping everything. We will need to live with this monstrosity of a pipeline project for at least 20 years. People living along coast deserve better treatment from federal government. #cdnpoli
693 2018-03-05 22:24:49 The US corn lobby will never let evidence like that get out. They are the people who came up with the idea of putting corn products into petrol to tackle climate change until people worked out how much oil it takes to grow the corn.
694 2018-03-05 22:24:42 No this is the thing... Hundreds of thousands of jobs have been lost in the US steel industry since the 80s. And they lost their jobs because of a steel depression sparked by the "Oil Embargo" & the revolution in Iran. The steel market froze up. 1/

696 2018-03-05 22:24:26 There is no oil drilling and thus no Bahamian oil involved or dividends to be distributed.  All operating permits are conditioned on a successful EIA and EMP certifies by independent processional experts.  #stopthefalsehype
697 2018-03-05 22:24:21 You should tell Genie Oil's investors.
698 2018-03-05 22:24:19 It is a "right" if it suits. If it the natives' right to own oil fields across Texas, you bet they'd over right that right.

710 2018-03-05 22:22:40 How on earth do you think that the $ you are talking about have value at all?
Because the US govt:
1/ won't accept tax paid with anything else,
2/ did a deal with the House of Saud in 1972(-ish) to ensure oil markets would be denominated in $.
Reading precedes understanding.
711 2018-03-05 22:22:40 Remember when @BKronenburg put a fish oil in @JoTrevorT ‘s grape and he beat the shit out of him?
712 2018-03-05 22:22:33 Fresh corn is best, but frozen works fine (let it thaw a little if you use frozen). Put in a frying pan with oil, salt, pepper. Makes a very tasty, almost buttery substitute for beans if you're like me and don't like beans.

730 2018-03-05 22:19:43 I hope after all this crap is done, when things settle down, when Putin and his Orange Buffoon are gone, and oil companies vie for contracts in Russia, that Exxon gets shunted to the side and others get those contracts.

744 2018-03-05 22:17:58 Tinned mackerel is literally only cents in supermarkets in extra virgin olive oil. It's wild and has omega 3 in it plus the mono fat from olive oil. I like this as an alternative to eggs for brek or as a nice snack or chop a few tins into a salad. Bitta gum afterwards lol
745 2018-03-05 22:17:54 Yup ladies it’s totally worth it. It can last up to 3 months depending on the oil based products you use. Mine lasted a good 4 months. You can add mascara and your set to go! No makeup or water for 24 hours after the service.
746 2018-03-05 22:17:40 Yes. Very. Read your history, the times of peaceful coexistence, the agricultural boom, groundnut pyramids, cocoa exports, self-sufficiency... the early oil boom. All before the greed. Good news, we wiser now.

But what's most concerning is the primary ingredient is vegetable oil, THAT is a huge contributor to inflammation, & possibly even cancer

855 2018-03-05 22:02:34 i love learning about natural skincare/ health & hygiene, trying new products & making new regimens. This month its baking soda soap, whipped white shea butter, vitamin e oil, and lemon oil.
856 2018-03-05 22:02:21 I’m sorry an hour for an oil change seems a little excessive. Let me back there
857 2018-03-05 22:02:10 Shocked to find that calf milk powder now seems to use palm oil!!!
858 2018-03-05 22:01:57 A core component of conservative philosophy is that capitalism should be unfettered by environmental protection. But that way of thinking gives us polluted rivers, extinct species, and oil drilling anywhere. So I find it laughable when an ultra-con like Erickson enjoys nature.
859 2018-03-05 22:01:42 Thank you...  voy a comprarme castor oil definitivamente.
860 2018-03-05 22:01:34 Still as a "neutral" sitting on golden throne made of middle eastern oil, I shall say it was a thrilling game, always is to see the small clubs battle it out, haha oh ai went there!

869 2018-03-05 22:00:29 With a Potential Ozonide Index of 192, our PurO3 Ozonated Hemp Oil is the strongest oil in our line of products. The properties of this oil, such as it’s hydrophobicity and how much ozone it can hold, make this oil great for treating skin conditions such as:

876 2018-03-05 21:59:52 @CanadianPM Support the Albertan oil and gas industry. It is traumatizing to watch your friends, family and community be devastated by the loss of jobs in concurrence with our provincial and federal governments lack of support. #cdnyouthpolicy

878 2018-03-05 21:59:36 To become a stand-out douche in this administration does take something. I think it is determination. Among climate deniers, wall street criminals and those who sell out for war, big oil & big pharma, he had the determination to ignore 22M emails and destroy net neutrality.
879 2018-03-05 21:59:27 I have.  Presumably you are in the oil areas and nobody wants to live there.  My province is full of high priced houses and exorbitantly priced shacks. None of the areas we considered are falling in price.

896 2018-03-05 21:57:14 I wonder if OPEC thinks the US is 'dumping oil'....
897 2018-03-05 21:57:13 Maybe they can use all that U.S. coal that nobody wants to run their oil rigs
898 2018-03-05 21:56:54 Getting the first oil change for the 2017 Traverse! It’s taking a lot longer than it should, but it’s free so I can’t complain. – bij Tennyson Chevrolet

I still think Water is the next oil though..
900 2018-03-05 21:56:34 Imagine having done it 20 times already sans oil money
901 2018-03-05 21:56:34 Hi Liam. Due to the same oil being we used, we do not classify our fries as a vegetarian option. Thank you.

903 2018-03-05 21:56:31 my locs need a hot oil treatment lol
904 2018-03-05 21:56:28 Tea tree oil yea, for them troublesome areas but dont use too much cos it’s strong. Dilute it if u have to first. Never tried WH on my body. You can buy VitaminE oil for body tho

906 2018-03-05 21:56:09 Same as any other raw material. But data has economic properties that make it much more potentially valuable than oil. Data is non-rivalrous, non-depleting and self-regenerating. Try that with oil! Nope. #infonomics #GartnerDA
907 2018-03-05 21:56:05 Hey Donald   thanks for holding Canada hostage.  Why aren't you putting tariffs on the oil that we are sending to the USA through the keystone pipeline?   Hypocrite!
908 2018-03-05 21:56:05 Not exactly sure for construction, but when I did engineering-adjacent things in the oil and gas industry (yeah, ew, I know) each project had a "Project Engineer" position overseeing that kind of stuff at a high level.

921 2018-03-05 21:54:27 Um, no. Oil industry spreads carcinogens, killing millions, tobacco industry lies for years, misleading public and killing millions, big pharma has pushed opioids when not needed and for longer periods than called for to create demand and killing millions.
922 2018-03-05 21:54:17 VitaminE oil helps. Also using a toner (I use witch hazel and a drop of tea tree oil) helps with blemishes

938 2018-03-05 21:52:13 Maybe I should capitalize on how popular trannies are right now and try to get some beard oil company sponsorship.  I'm fairly sure YouTube would demonitize me if they let me get ad revenue at all. 
939 2018-03-05 21:52:05 Quite a change from the late 70's when the U.S. Oil resources were supposedly dry and we had to buy oil from the middle east for whatever  price they set. I t looks like Trump is some kind of miracle worker compared to those days.

964 2018-03-05 21:48:36 Ya, considering we’re so reliant on it. The tipping point for renewable energy in Canada is a long way off.  

Today the US has surpassed OPEC as worlds largest oil producer.
965 2018-03-05 21:48:31 We are a club renowned for not spending money unlike Oil FC who buy full backs and keepers for the price of strikers. Disgraceful.

970 2018-03-05 21:47:17 No...Putin chose Rexxon for his Redneck accent. Kompromat from Exxon-Russia oil deals had Nothing to do with his appointment.
971 2018-03-05 21:47:15 ...and jet/kerosene is still the fastest growing fuel (in % terms), while gasoil/diesel continues to be the category with the highest demand (volume and share).This is mostly on the back of increased transportation demand from EM and a shift away from fuel oil in marine bunker.
972 2018-03-05 21:47:03 I have already got into bed and realised that I have forgot to put castor oil on my brows

976 2018-03-05 21:46:15 My father and grand father always kept saying that i should stick to seasalt as that purified salt is deadly.
Same with the butter, either it's real butter none of that synthetic stuff.
Like my granma kept insisting and then taking garlic and fish oil capsules.
977 2018-03-05 21:46:07 @realDonaldTrump I am told we are not dependent on oil to other countries. Why in the hell are we paying the same for gas. Unless this hppens, I won't believe in our  economy
978 2018-03-05 21:46:03 I'm on similar medications and def looking into that cannabis/cannabis oil they were talking about- anyone catch the name of the company that older guy was running? He seemed to understand it all and safety side.
979 2018-03-05 21:45:56 Putting a number on it, that's about $360 million/day more not leaving the USA. Add that to the 8 million barrels/day more now vs 2 yr ago and the tax money going to the USA treasury from our oil will be $trillions/yr.
980 2018-03-05 21:45:50 detailing my bby & then getting my oil change tomm, gotta keep up with him! 
981 2018-03-05 21:45:32 I surely would like the womens face when the barber starts rubbing in the hair tonic oil, then towel dry, some men do tend to preen themselves better than the women; would you like a hot towel treatment ouch heh heh
982 2018-03-05 21:45:14 Hey Sean why is the oil going down us two things not refineries or someone/something is purposely slowing down production to drive the cost crude higher what do thinks ...and by the way I have multipurpose sauce that fits on anything
983 2018-03-05 21:45:04 Okay need to see if i can get my car oil changed today...I'm behind in that schedule..

989 2018-03-05 21:44:41 FTC Challenges Proposed Acquisition of Conagra’s Wesson Cooking Oil Brand by Crisco owner, J.M. Smucker Co. The merger of Crisco and Wesson would give Smucker power to raise prices of leading canola and vegetable cooking oil brands sold to U.S. retailers, the complaint alleges.
990 2018-03-05 21:44:34 I need an oil diffuser
991 2018-03-05 21:44:23 I could’ve been on a cruise with my sorority sisters but I gave it up because I thought it would put me in a bad financial place... here I am, not in a bikini or smelling like coconut tan oil. Just sick and cold instead 
992 2018-03-05 21:44:22 apparently this bee  likes coconut oil #shoo
993 2018-03-05 21:44:20 Lot's of businesses get grants, govt support, etc. Mostly the oil industry, but many others. Are they bribes too? Or do you just not like the MSM?
994 2018-03-05 21:44:13 Am certain that the  Obfuscator-In-Chief will have fuzzified reality beyond recognition to promote  whatever outcome he and his supporters might wish for; including credit for things he has little to do with.  Deal with this hallucinating Snake Oil salesmen at your peril.
995 2018-03-05 21:44:02 anything they study. If science was a true leader in what we take as fact, then the world would not need oil as an energy source. You take in count all the false hoods of science like climate change and we discover the he who cash the cash can get anything results from research -
996 2018-03-05 21:43:58 And even then we weren't splashing cash everywhere the reason we were probably 2nd highest back then is because transfer fees didn't cost what they do now. We have not spent anywhere near what City have because we aren't run by a Sheikh and his oil money. Pretty simply really.

999 2018-03-05 21:43:49 Aha. Misunderstood you. Yes, that argument makes more sense. But see my comment below: I think chasing societal consensus is chasing a mirage. I would be very happy if 20 percent of Norwegians became very vocal in their demand for a new oil policy for example!

1001 2018-03-05 21:43:41 I always struggle to not sing along to the radio in the waiting area when my car is getting an oil change. 70s-00s music. How can you not want to sing along to Billy Joel, GnR, and Blur?!

1010 2018-03-05 21:41:50 The DOJ and FBI used their power to try and predetermine a presidential election, that is a prime example of why the second amendment was part of our constitution! It wasn't only to protect us from bad people but to have a defense against an evil gov't!

1058 2018-03-05 21:35:05 The Trump Administration should have to prove there is a NEED to sell off our oil leases. I don’t believe there is any economic need other than the Administration’s desire to push our nation’s future wealth into the hands of Oligarchs.

The vessel under construction will soon produce 200 000 barrels of petrol a day. A historic project for the first crude oil producer in Africa #sabcnews
1115 2018-03-05 21:28:25 I wish that when I did things related to my car (oil change, etc), I could transform into a man so men at the dealership wouldn’t trick me into getting $400 service checks on my car. #FemaleProblems
1116 2018-03-05 21:28:20 Probably genuine, the transformers are overloaded and use oil as a coolant.
1117 2018-03-05 21:28:18 Kangin get confused about what to teach Kyu,
because once Kyu incorrectly entered oil when
cooking a simple ham.
1118 2018-03-05 21:28:12 Me too, conceptual art is something I need to work on to appreciate. I much prefer skill in a craft, the craft of oil paint for eg  #dosomethingarty

Venezuela supposedly has 25% of all known #oil and what happened to them 

250 Billion barrels of oil?

Country Destroyed!

Doesn’t add up?
1124 2018-03-05 21:27:29 I have the Brain Octane. I was told the XCT oil has more C8 Caprylic acid per serving which converts to Ketones more rapidly and efficiently as compared to C10 capric acid. What you think?
1125 2018-03-05 21:27:23 Political  truths are a many headed dragon,anything can be justified in the name of God, Country and big oil,where is the Special Counsel to lnvestigate The Iraqi boondoggle
1126 2018-03-05 21:27:10 America wouldn't be so desperate for oil if Donkey Kong hadn't wasted thousands of barrels of it to kill Mario in 1981.
1127 2018-03-05 21:27:09 I have so many regrets with not pursuing cannabis oil for my terminally ill mum, I watch shows like this and just think 'what if?' Would she still be here? Maybe  Especially now when I struggle with chronic pain and have been thinking of trying it myself..... #TheKyleFiles

1130 2018-03-05 21:26:39 I guess we should be keeping an eye on cash reserves of the oil majors as the suits proceed.  Could be an interesting indicator.
1131 2018-03-05 21:26:27 @marksandspencer does your avocado oil spread contain palm oil? Or do you do a dairy free spread that is palm oil free? Thanks
1132 2018-03-05 21:26:27 #KyleFiles UK Gov "cannabis offers no medicinal benefits". Bull!!
The aristocracy have been popping oil for years! When was the last time you heard a member of the monarchy or PM etc die from cancer?
1133 2018-03-05 21:26:02 Not so much antidotes as they induced vomiting. 
But poison beyond certain limits cannot be removed from the system. 
Secondly, you must KNOW you've been poisoned.

Palm oil must be taken in copious amounts to induce vomiting.
1134 2018-03-05 21:26:02 I DO THIS. YOURE SO RIGHT. OMG I LOVE BABY OIL, I USE IT FOR MY CUTICLES TOO 
1135 2018-03-05 21:25:58 “Aerial repairman coming tomorrow”.

1140 2018-03-05 21:25:23 So some cunt at Ford thought it would be a good idea to have  oil change warning flash up automatically 'x' number of months after manufacture, regardless of mileage, wear, or any other factors. I would happily stab this person's eyes.
1141 2018-03-05 21:25:17 This all sounds a complete rerun of SNP tosh re iScot economy. Tessa will produce secret oil fields yet. Or maybe Hannan...

1144 2018-03-05 21:24:15 Not illuminating rivers is the best and easiest solution. Would you say: we aim to reduce the amount of oil we spill directly into the river? No? Than why do that with light?
This illumination is pointless and harmful.
1145 2018-03-05 21:24:09 Melt?  No. Soften & weaken?  Yes absolutely.  In the steam locomotive era, the vast majority of boiler explosions were caused by low water allowing the roof of the firebox, without water above it, to soften and collapse.  And that was with a coal or oil fire, nothing super hot.

1147 2018-03-05 21:23:53 1. Its the PRESENT not past. 2. Hemp Oil / Bio Diesel .. Too many to list reasons it won't work.. give it 100 years or so. 3. Solar in 20 yrs maybe with little to 0 mpact. Wind is a scam..maybe 50 yrs. Wave, seriously? Better catalytic conv for now would be best. Simple.
1148 2018-03-05 21:23:33 Are the CEO's afraid trump will find out & get the GOP to take back it's Tax Bill handouts? Trump will lose money if they stick with oil & coal energy. Or, more apropo, the Koch Brothers will lose money!
1149 2018-03-05 21:23:28 Wow, you are desperate not to learn about history.
Of course there was a different legal team.
Bury your head in the sand for all I care. Just remember you were warned to not place your faith in this snake oil salesman.
1150 2018-03-05 21:23:28 Witch hazel is AWESOME!! See if u can find one with rose oil, just make sure not to use it too much bc i did and it made my face super super dry
1151 2018-03-05 21:23:27 I tell people that driving costs 54 cents/mile, and they go "Huh".  

And then I start laying it out

$20,000/200,000 miles is 10 cents
gas is 10-15 cents
Insurance isn't quite linear, but I was paying 15 cents
that tire replacement every 60,000 miles is 2 cents...
Oil change...
1152 2018-03-05 21:23:11 Our next speaker is @borrepeder from @KSAT_Kongsberg. He is discussing the use of micro-SAR in the use of maritime surveillance programmes. He launched his talk with a powerful video demonstrating how they can actively detect and track oil spills #WhatOnEarth2018

1154 2018-03-05 21:22:40 Organic coconut oil "on special" in @woolworths $14. Local organic store same size not on special $9. Most organic in local store cheaper than woolies non organic. Rip off company with no morals.
1155 2018-03-05 21:22:25 Clive Humby, 2006: “Data is the new oil. It’s valuable, but if unrefined it cannot really be used. It has to be changed into gas, plastic, chemicals, etc to create a valuable entity that drives profitable activity; so must data be broken down, analyzed for it to have value.”
1156 2018-03-05 21:22:14 I got CBD oil to try so hopefully that helps with pain xx
1157 2018-03-05 21:22:11 Maybe you can try biotin supplements and castor oil rubs

1160 2018-03-05 21:21:57 Curious extent of correlation with oil, that you see?  Or just what you anticipate for oil at this point?

1228 2018-03-05 21:13:41 Sorry. CCU is carbon capture and utilization, in this case for EOR (enhanced oil recovery). CCS is sequestration. DAC is direct air capture, a form of CDR (carbon dioxide removal). FOAK = first of a kind. The $30/ton for DAC is additive to either the $35/ton CCU or $50/ton CCS.

1230 2018-03-05 21:13:37 I don't personally consider Trump a conservative.
I think he is a pragmatist who has successfully enacted some conservative policies and taken some conservative actions (such as rolling back all but 7 of the 200+ regs Obama placed on the oil industry.)

1243 2018-03-05 21:12:21 How about we start putting a hefty tariff on the hydro we send over, the oil, wood, copper...the list goes on.

1245 2018-03-05 21:12:13 Huh?  A second "peak oil"?
1246 2018-03-05 21:12:06 Not that I condone the behaviour .... but it speaks directly to why YEG has issues attracting Free Agents and being on NO-Trade lists.
1247 2018-03-05 21:12:02 CTS gettn that young oil change
1248 2018-03-05 21:11:51 Haha. It’s an oil for his food. Damn high maintenance pets!
1249 2018-03-05 21:11:43 Do people even realize how much money you can save simply by settling for kinda slutty olive oil?
1250 2018-03-05 21:11:43 Castor oil works sooo well yes
1251 2018-03-05 21:11:42 I guess the oil is good for anal fissure?
1252 2018-03-05 21:11:38 Walmart literally tried to tell me I had no oil cap at all
1253 2018-03-05 21:11:33 where by "discussion" I mean "even mentioning that they exist and not pretending that it's another thing like a physically-related checkup or an oil change or any other of numerous excuses, not even discussing actual content of the appointment
1254 2018-03-05 21:11:23 I swear ATMs in 9ja need timers.. wen ur time is up, it shld retain the card and spray hot oil at the person.. Shikenan.
1255 2018-03-05 21:11:05 Man City are the dominant force they are because of a major sheikh oil investment nothing more nothing less. A pub side on oily steroids
1256 2018-03-05 21:10:38 Lol I could only drink it black, unless it’s with butter and Mct oil then we talkin haha
1257 2018-03-05 21:10:38 Rich focusing on oil & gas. Not hearing anything about renewables
1258 2018-03-05 21:10:36 Fatih Birol @IEA  great debate on #oil demand and #EV, but people are not looking at petrochemicals  demand,  a giant in future oil consumption #CERAweek
1259 2018-03-05 21:10:27 Facts I paid like $120 for an oil change 
1260 2018-03-05 21:10:21 咎さんも猫苦手なのか…
1261 2018-03-05 21:10:17 Just smothered my hair in coconut oil, now I’m hearing talks about the water supply in rugby being cut off, I can’t leave the house like this 
1262 2018-03-05 21:10:12 God told Moses to collect a range of items for use in building the Mishkan: gold, silver, bronze, blue, purple, scarlet, linen, goats hair, tanned skins, leather, acacia wood, oil, spices, onyx, precious stones
1263 2018-03-05 21:10:08 エクストラバージンオイルってなんか卑猥だよね。
1264 2018-03-05 21:10:03 The cost of the war was more than recouped through plundering Iraq’s oil.
1265 2018-03-05 21:09:54 He's given you the deal. Your not in power, should have done it when you were. Elections have consequences, remember?
1266 2018-03-05 21:09:42 おやすみなさい♪
1267 2018-03-05 21:09:36 The US needs to stop funding terrorists to overthrow democratically elected presidents in oil rich sovereign countries. Please stop pretending to be a US embassy in Syria.
1268 2018-03-05 21:09:35 Unfortunately I found 10 guillemots on stretch from Fraisthorpe to South brid yesterday doing BBS all recent carcasses,  no oil, whole birds. Plus 11 woodcock. In total 32 birds in a 2 km stretch!
1269 2018-03-05 21:09:32 You can make it without onion. Potatoes, egges, oil, cheese, salt and pepper its all you need
1270 2018-03-05 21:09:16 and @POTUS @realDonaldTrump wants to kill shale oil by taxing steel for oil pipelines..what a stupid policy mistake.
1271 2018-03-05 21:09:09 Hey, guys. We're going on a national bikini tour and we're looking for two oil boys who can grease us up before each competition.
1272 2018-03-05 21:09:08 Waffling on storage of nuclear waste, evaded taking a stand by moving to bad roads here even tho have oil $$ coming in.
1273 2018-03-05 21:09:04 When you sister asks you if olive oil is made of animal fat.... :/
1274 2018-03-05 21:08:58 Found a guy playing in Boston. Classic Chia.
1275 2018-03-05 21:08:58 and in a lot of other cities they are known. Players who want to avoid it being recognized, will always avoid it but it's secondary to many. Getting paid and winning remains priority one to most but you are right, being able to get lost in certain markets is attractive.
1276 2018-03-05 21:08:57 should've done the oil spill fire
1277 2018-03-05 21:08:56 Cooking utensils, condiments and seasonings (the basics, ketchup, olive oil), water, dish soap, cleaning supplies (at least a disinfectant spray), extra towels, white bedding (shows cleanliness), coffee/tea + stuff for that
1278 2018-03-05 21:08:52 Some people just don’t want to drown eggs with oil/butter so we put less of it and it sticks a lil 
1279 2018-03-05 21:08:44 Way to go President Trump! Freeing us from the Arab Nations that hate us and show that hatred buy their high oil prices. Making America great again!
1280 2018-03-05 21:08:38 He played Mexico and Canada for fools. 

I was hoping he'd try to Annex Alberta for the oil maybe that's next. 

This was the end game all a long blocking the back door one way or another. 

You can't stupid the Trump.
1281 2018-03-05 21:08:36 Got in the shower and I now have stretch marks over my bum as well as my legs  who said pregnancy is beautiful?!
Only think rory doesn’t mind because he gets to put bio oil all over me twice a day!
1282 2018-03-05 21:08:35 #CERAWeek Fatih Birol:   If every other car sold is an electric car, oil demand will continue to grow.  Slow-down in growth largely due to increased us of natgas for HD truck market.
1283 2018-03-05 21:08:22 Oil.
1284 2018-03-05 21:08:03 Oh come on.  It was only the Order of Friendship from Putin personally.  Would never think and oil man would be dishonest in his duties.  But of course that's what friends are for if you are truly  drilling for answers.
1285 2018-03-05 21:07:44 When in doubt, look to the cosmos and massage lavender oil into your temples.
1286 2018-03-05 21:07:39 Castor oil helps!
1287 2018-03-05 21:07:33 ???

If EVs are adopted as proposed, then crude oil has to adjust, not just gasoline. Gasoline is ~45-50% of the barrell.
1288 2018-03-05 21:07:30 No. Makhan as well. Just make it with pomace oil
1289 2018-03-05 21:07:10 The U.S. is poised to become the World's largest oil producer. It could've happened back in the 90s if they tapped my face in high school.
1290 2018-03-05 21:07:01 Vitamin e oil!
1291 2018-03-05 21:06:57 Still consistent at least. Top priority is the non citizen.
1292 2018-03-05 21:06:54 Don't detangle dry hair!first, make a mixture of moyonaise,egg yolke,avocado and coconut oil.then section and apply...make sure  every thread is covered..then with a bigtoothed comb do the magic!then cover with shower cap as long  as u wish!! !!No shampoo!No drying!EASYP
1293 2018-03-05 21:06:44 Petrochemicals are a "hidden giant" of demand for oil/gas, IEA's Birol #CERAWeek
1294 2018-03-05 21:06:40 Olive oil is for cooking and pretty flowers are for smelling ONLY
1295 2018-03-05 21:06:20 One week from today I’ll be packing up to hit the offshore oil rigs 
1296 2018-03-05 21:06:18 Canada is also the largest supplier of oil to the US.
1297 2018-03-05 21:05:55 Paquista+oil 
1298 2018-03-05 21:05:55 What a fucking title race this would be if it wasn’t for oil.
1299 2018-03-05 21:05:48 Clinique take the day off balm followed by cerave hydrating cleanser will help! My usual cleansers before this were too harsh on accutane, this is the only combo that doesn’t dry me or irritate my skin! Rose hip oil before your moisturizer and lanolin lip products are lifesavers!

1304 2018-03-05 21:05:07 steel tariffs aluminum oil gun e.u production trade israel guns
1305 2018-03-05 21:04:59 Great, but why are gas and fuel oil prices going up instead of down?  We were told energy independence would bring prices down.
1306 2018-03-05 21:04:57 Mate if that's the best you've got it says it all really. Go back to Oil FC
1307 2018-03-05 21:04:51 Don’t get me wrong we wouldn’t be what we are without the investment but now we are in profit every year and don’t rely on oil money like we used to, plus we have no debt unlike you lot I think 3-4 PL teams have spending power like city and united but the owners don’t put out

1309 2018-03-05 21:04:42 I’ve heard CBD oil is supposed to help with depression (and has other health benefits) but doesn’t have like any THC in it. I haven’t tried so idk, but it’s worth a shot
1310 2018-03-05 21:04:16 The eco style black castor and flaxseed oil gel is a no go for me  , the hold sucks , glad I only got a small container because it don’t hold my curls at all. The only thing I like about it is it smells good 
1311 2018-03-05 21:04:09 Before 1900 no one need oil products in everything including the environment. Now the gold plated tax heaven imperialists (who pay no tax) want another tax on oil products.

Restrict production. Tax production. Fine production. Stop polluting rather than paying to clean it up.
1312 2018-03-05 21:04:08 US should not confuse being largest oil producer in the world with being the largest exporter; Middle East will continue to be the dominant oil exporting region in the world #CERAWeek
1313 2018-03-05 21:04:06 NO DRILLING! If we can't have escaped Atlantic Salmon mucking things up, certainly we can't afford the potential of a leaky oil rig?!
1314 2018-03-05 21:03:40 I have just started using oil to get me off all the prescription drugs i i was addicted to and made me feel like a zombie 24/7. I only take CBD and it helps massively with all kinds of issues from pain, anxiety and sleeping issues. Regulated THC will not harm people #kylefiles
1315 2018-03-05 21:03:39 Try melted virgin coconut oil in her food ... it’s the best for dogs digestion, skin allergies — you name it.  Let Lini lick the spoon it’s on :). Poor pup
1316 2018-03-05 21:03:38 .@IEABirol: US should not confuse becoming the world’s largest #oil producer and its largest oil exporter. Very different implications. Saudi Arabia will remain largest exporter for foreseeable future.  #CERAWeek18 #OOTT
1317 2018-03-05 21:03:27 Short of throwing a bit of penetrating oil at it not a lot else that can be suggested (short of getting it serviced). Obviously don't do that when the fire is warm let alone lit!
1318 2018-03-05 21:03:25 Problem is .... In LA, Phoenix or Tampa, almost no-one knows who an NHL player is
1319 2018-03-05 21:03:12 Oil platforms are essentially a man made reef. We need more of these not less.

1332 2018-03-05 21:01:31 1959-1973 Mandatory Oil Price Program was law. Created an oversupply of refining capacity, other market distortions. With repeal, refineries were shuttered and consolidated.

That's the general way it is in markets.
1333 2018-03-05 21:01:09 Don’t know what made me think i could lay out in tanning oil today when i havent tanned all year 
1334 2018-03-05 21:01:07 Fatih Birol  @IEA. Legacy oil decline causes loss of one north sea or about 3 MMB/d/y, plus there is new demand growth, longer term new supply investment is not enough to offset. Barkindo fr OPEC agrees.. we are sowing the seeds of future energy crisis #CERAweek

1340 2018-03-05 21:00:20 Nutcrafter do amazing cashew nut-based cheeses but they are pricey! Violife are coconut oil based and more reasonably priced but remind me a wee bit of kraft cheese (i.e. plasticky). I tend to make my own cashew “cheese” which is dead easy

1344 2018-03-05 21:00:00 Spanish omelette:
Potatoes, egges, onions and oil.
1345 2018-03-05 20:59:51 And this is what our minority government hangs it hat on. Goes to show you that Weaver keeps the NDP in power so PR can ruin or Province even more. Ban Griz hunting. Ban Oil and LNG, then 3-4 parties will never be able to make a clear decision on anything, except back door deals
1346 2018-03-05 20:59:41 I like how people say we need to move away from oil and gas but there isn’t a viable cheaper alternative. Solar Power and wind mills suck and don’t produce enough power, the end. I’m not gonna drive a Prius either and will stick with my Chevy 3/4 ton. I will stay in the dark ages
1347 2018-03-05 20:59:34 Sec Gen Barkindo skirts short-term implications of Brazil, US shale, N Sea being able to meet #oil demand growth. Notes longer-term trajectory is toward underinvestment causing issues. So is OPEC just going to wait around?  #CERAWeek18
1348 2018-03-05 20:59:24 Here we agree with the more free form of government and MacArthur falls under that category but that doesn't mean we won't give oil to Long. We accept any person who wants to trade. We will try to not be biased as best as we can.
1349 2018-03-05 20:59:21 Fuck him. We can find other markets for our steel and aluminum ship it instead of oil.
1350 2018-03-05 20:59:20 The US fracking industry was able to expand thanks to high oil prices and, especially, "loose money" policies of the Federal Reserves which meant they could easily finance and refinance. But now the trend is toward higher interest rates, which spells trouble for fracking.
1351 2018-03-05 20:59:07 Probably our own fault for buying crap in supermarkets for oils (more oil trees-less jungle)! Their government should be doing something. Or we start a GoFunding page and buy some land #converttojungle

1353 2018-03-05 20:58:30 Today, we found some fun, viciousness , some phony, some truth, all what is out there on Twitterverse   i was happy and sad,  curious, surprised, had some laughs,  and  now  i will retreat for a shower/scrubs/oil ritual, Be-good ....till im back 
1354 2018-03-05 20:58:22 Trying to put oil in my car bc it’s something I’m actually capable of doing myself and still need help bc the person who last changed the oil put the cap on too tight 
1355 2018-03-05 20:58:22 So what, we were already pumping that much crude oil here in the US! So, why haven’t pump prices gone down since we import a lot less than before? Tell us Donald!
1356 2018-03-05 20:58:16 I honestly don’t know lol  I barely ever use heat anymore and I started using the “it’s a 10” leave in conditioner w keratin after I shower. & also argan & morocco oil
1357 2018-03-05 20:58:14 OPEC Sec Gen Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo: Both oil producers and consumers are concerned about trend in investment, needs attention #CERAWeek
1358 2018-03-05 20:57:57 .@IEA Exec Director Fatih Birol shares three #oil trends in next 5 years @CERAWeek. 1. Strong growth in #oil  demand driven by China and India.
1359 2018-03-05 20:57:53 So far, the message coming from #CERAWeek regarding oil seems to be: We must find more oil so we can continue burning up our climate. There can be another path, and it doesn't run through this conference in Houston.
1360 2018-03-05 20:57:51 It's that olive oil.
1361 2018-03-05 20:57:42 both of those you can easily do on your own. But why does it cost that much anyway. I never pay more than 40 for an oil change and my tire rotations are free.
1362 2018-03-05 20:57:42 #OPEC Sec Gen Barkindo tells @CERAWeek: "Sharp contraction" in oil & gas investment in the last 2 years; that's not in the interest of the global economy #OOTT #oilandgas #CERAWeek18
1363 2018-03-05 20:57:33 DCU was awarded an ISO 50001 for all natural resources in 2017, a certification of reaching international conservation standards. This was due in part to both the lighting project in Glasnevin and replacing oil tanks with gas-fueled boilers in the All Hallows’ campus! #MG334

1366 2018-03-05 20:56:50 I don’t play about my car bruh. I worked hard for my own shit, take care of my shit, every nail that’s been in the tire, oil change, car washes, monthly payments, insurance I put in this bitch, so what makes a mf think I’m willingly going to let them drive my car ?
1367 2018-03-05 20:56:16 Next time you go get your oil changed I recommend asking them if they can check the battery for you and if they tell you that it's not doing very well you should probably go exchange it with your warranty.
1368 2018-03-05 20:56:09 Burning the midnight oil. It's going to be a long long week.
1369 2018-03-05 20:56:00 U.S., Norway, Brazil, and Canada accommodate all oil demand growth over next five years, says IEA's Birol. What say you OPEC? #CERAWeek
1370 2018-03-05 20:55:59 Clove oil diluted on chest & bottoms of feet

1372 2018-03-05 20:55:43 There is no farming up there. If it was not for the oil there would not be a city up there. No farms after you turn on Hwy 63 heading north. Not much farm land in northern Alberta.
1373 2018-03-05 20:55:39 While French leaders, incl Pres  Macron, have criticized Iran’s missile program, French companies like oil giant Total SA, carmaker Renault and airplane manufacturer Airbus have bullishly entered the Iranian market after the atomic accord, complicating any possible sanctions. @AP

1375 2018-03-05 20:55:32 After the BP oil spill, I stopped buying from BP.  I avoid Exxon-Mobile too, unless I have no other option, because I don't like their business practices.  That's more powerful and more hurtful to them than anything the govt could do and they can't MAKE YOU buy from them.

1382 2018-03-05 20:54:49 Not to mention Exxon just broke ties with Gasprom, the state controlled Russian oil and gas company.  That has to be connected somehow.
1383 2018-03-05 20:54:40 Putin didn't show no display of his missiles hitting North Korea and that should be your wake up call Putin is doing side deals with North Korea they're getting oil from North Korea Putin is playing you like a fool and you need to focus on Putin

1390 2018-03-05 20:54:08 IEA's Fatih Birol: Each year we lose one North Sea's worth of oil supply; upstream investment flat in 2017 flat; up slightly so far in 2018... but far too low to meet demand #CERAWeek

1397 2018-03-05 20:53:42 Because of Tillerson’s Arctic oil deal with Putin.
1398 2018-03-05 20:53:34 #CERAWeek   Attending CERAWeek in Houston and currently listening to Fatih Birol, executive Director of IEC - just said no slowdown in oil demand and certainly no evidence of supply peaking.
1399 2018-03-05 20:53:01 President Trump's steel tariffs will hit the US energy industry hard just as the US is poised to lead world oil…
1400 2018-03-05 20:52:52 The camader and the captain APoling  so  3 trillion dollers  on the Iraq war and we didn't take the gas and oil of Saddam Hussein  and his country so what did we invade for if we didn't take the gas and oil  then so I told trump that the STARGATE  is far more @CorrectWinger
1401 2018-03-05 20:52:33 #OPEC Sec Gen Barkindo: the success of the #oil supply agreement has returned a level of optimism to the industry that wasn’t there at #CERAWeek last year. Clear from content, attendance, richer food served at lunch. #CERAWeek18
1402 2018-03-05 20:52:31 Hilarious drops the hammer. Sadly these incompetent liberals could not negotiate their way out of a wet paper bag. Junior has decimated the Oil and gas sector thinking his pet Quebec would be untouched guess what the liberal stalling tactics on NAFTA have bitten them in the ass.
1403 2018-03-05 20:52:20 Did any Iraqi or any middle eastern govt. pulled down any statue? Tell we're not Americans or Russians, who can do anything for oil.
1404 2018-03-05 20:52:10 Jiffy lube getting out of hand with these oil change prices
1405 2018-03-05 20:52:07 The most common suggestion is wd40 but then that requires something to get out the oil stain,,,,,,
1406 2018-03-05 20:51:47 Eco terrorists itself is misinformation. How is protecting the real tangible value of our environment a terrorist act? How is clean water, air, soil bad? You are slaves to money that comes from death. Oil is obsolete, since the 1900's. MADMAX or StarTrek. Pick your future wisely.
1407 2018-03-05 20:51:47 Did he go to SE Asia and drop flaming oil on little girls and then tell the world he just saved them?

1412 2018-03-05 20:51:35 I was out of tahini, so I used this recipe because it didn't require it. But I did add lemon juice and sesame oil!
1413 2018-03-05 20:51:28 You still make more contact with it than just randomly picking up packaged bananas. They’ve tried this crap with something else, can’t remember what now. They gave in with pressure. Oil makes plastic 
1414 2018-03-05 20:51:14 I’m sure he must oil them
1415 2018-03-05 20:51:03 Mohammad Barkindo, secretary-general of Opec: the improved quality of the lunch at #CERAWeek18 shows why the whole of the oil industry should be grateful to the 24 countries that agreed to curb production in 2016

1419 2018-03-05 20:49:36 There is a domestic market - but only for Sativex (assuming we discount the grey market for cbd oil). Sativex is a useful and tested medicine but expensive and not optimal for many patients - whose only option is street cannabis or nothing.
1420 2018-03-05 20:49:36 2 of 2; as climate change goals bite (less or imposs expensive oil available to burn) in coming years, who’s going to catch our fish if @DefraFisheries & @The_MMO have allowed UK’s small scale coastal fishing fleet to die out as it currently is?
1421 2018-03-05 20:49:35 My nose is fuckin red raw from all the blowing. It's surprisingly hard to moisturise a nose! I need Tinny's olive oil lip balm

1428 2018-03-05 20:48:50 "If you don't think 18 years olds are mature enough to own an AK-47 or AR-15, then quit sending them to war to die for oil."
1429 2018-03-05 20:48:49 “Can you pick me up from sac” no my car has no oil I have to get it changed “but I can give you gas money” okay but my car still don’t have oil “I can pay you for it” okay but I still need an oil change ?
1430 2018-03-05 20:48:47 was helping my dad change the tire of his car today and some old man in an oil truck drives by and shouts ‘stick to the singing’ it was the weirdest thing ever hahahah
1431 2018-03-05 20:48:46 Since Mexico is so rich in oil we should work with them instead of using up all of our own oil resources.  We maybe sorry one day if we start depleting a lot of our oil.
1432 2018-03-05 20:48:45 My oil change?  $89.49

1436 2018-03-05 20:48:10 Foreign portfolio investment is the chief reason for this. Nigeria better pray oil remains above 60. If oil takes a nosedive these thrill seeking investors will punish us like they did in late 2014...

1440 2018-03-05 20:47:46 It’s brilliant isn’t it? All That Remains & Snake Oil are the stand out tracks for me.
1441 2018-03-05 20:47:44 Careful when sourcing Carrot Seed Oil as much of it is highly refined! It's not a very common or cheap oil when it's truly cold-pressed.

1457 2018-03-05 20:45:45 We use virgin coconut oil. From the baking section at the grocery store.
1458 2018-03-05 20:45:33 Tillerson awarded Russian Order of Friendship in 2013.  Tillerson won the award after signing deals with the state-owned Russian oil company Rosneft, whose chief, Igor Sechin, is seen as Putin's loyal lieutenant.
1459 2018-03-05 20:45:25 Why? I call it as I see it. Abortions,open boarders,globalization,anti-Religion, anti oil, Anti-Nationism, Anti Gender recognition,It takes a village type mentality.
1460 2018-03-05 20:45:23 Defo, if it prolonged a life an made day to day life easier with a better quality they really should look into it, you don't need to smoke it, I'm sure they could extract the oil's for capsule form or even like the wee cod liver oil thing's 
1461 2018-03-05 20:45:21 Oil independence - why did it take so long

1471 2018-03-05 20:44:24 He's an expert clown.
1472 2018-03-05 20:44:17 right on. My wife attended an NRA sponsored women's event at our local range. The NRA taught gun safety to females who had no training with weapons and my wife learned a lot and thoroughly enjoyed the event.
1473 2018-03-05 20:44:03 @RichieAllenShow Rebecca could try supplementing endocannabinoid system with CBD oil, this may give her some relief from her symptoms. Feel so sorry for her. Xx
1474 2018-03-05 20:44:02 Yes, been there--  disaster. The San Joachin Valley is void of anything but  ag and oil. Using up water for irrigation and spraying poisons.

1477 2018-03-05 20:43:43 Indira ke time to bahut jyada left the(economic) . Because of many reasons.
Indira needed cpi support during 1969 split so he became socialist. Bank, oil, insurance nationalisation her legacy of socialism.
2nd reason was she needed USSE support esp in 1971 war.

1480 2018-03-05 20:43:36 That sounds like good news!  America has gun training options.  But not everyone is going to get military training.  I’ll just hope my NRA instructor was in military and conveys that great  info to me.
1481 2018-03-05 20:43:27 Id rather drink straight olive oil
1482 2018-03-05 20:43:22 Yea, its where the LOTR movies are.set. although oddly, Sealand is a rewl place too :p

1487 2018-03-05 20:43:00 So you sold the bears ear to help the children but there is no oil so they gain nothing so why did you repeal the bears ear? Your argument makes no sense. Time for you to step down. Don’t wait for your term to end.
1488 2018-03-05 20:42:23 3. You will probably want to throw your lavender oil and chi ball at the first mommy who asks you if you had a natural birth.

Coconut oil & baking soda work just fine.

1491 2018-03-05 20:42:14 i wish the solution was as simple as a pipeline.    But as soon as you build that pipe it’s full of oil.   there’s thousands of wells that are sitting idle waiting on more pipeline and rail capacity and better price.
1492 2018-03-05 20:42:02 How else are you going to receive the giraffe anointing prophet Chamisa was talking about without the oil? You must get the oil for the things, chiono chemberi chii chii, see beyond the mountains
1493 2018-03-05 20:41:57 That's a friggin'' shame! Think of the wildlife this is going to wipe out, as well as, what these oil companies will do to the environment! Hope Mueller speeds it up until the dems can fix this!
1494 2018-03-05 20:41:43 And from the state that leads the country’s economy - enjoy your oil as we save the planet and lead the world in a green direction
1495 2018-03-05 20:41:38 15 mins not bad what’s the problem when I head to Europe I wait longer than that on the oil funded M25

1503 2018-03-05 20:41:09 Grab a few toilet seat covers to cut up into 2-inch squares. These are great for soaking up excess oil on your face.
1504 2018-03-05 20:41:05 Picked this baby up on Quintessa. Nice folks, the Quintessons. Give you a good deal and... mh.. aaall the oil you can drink.

1514 2018-03-05 20:39:46 Also side note, if you take a closer  look at attendance pre oil money, you barely got 20k in the 80s and 90s

1516 2018-03-05 20:39:38 my bf gave me a new oil for my pen he got me, an edible, a cone with weed, and a couple grams....all while i smoked his stuff all weekend 
1517 2018-03-05 20:39:36 Oil on my balls 
banana in my ass

That's amazé (atheist)
1518 2018-03-05 20:39:33 Ok. Acabo de escuchar Man Of Oil de Animal Collective. Creo que alguien ya me había preguntado si los había escuchado. Creo que dije que sí. El punto es que no lo había hecho pero ahora voy a entrar a un vórtice del cual no podré salir asta que escuche todo lo que han hecho.
1519 2018-03-05 20:39:32 Quite like some of the oil crisis Pontis, like that too 
1520 2018-03-05 20:39:25 being a college student is pulling the sticker with the mileage to get your oil changed at off when you finally go to get it done so they don’t know how shamefully far past that mileage you let it go
1521 2018-03-05 20:39:17 You got a point but giraffe anointing oil?! I’m done 
1522 2018-03-05 20:39:11 3/3 for the essential oil questions on #universitychallenge! My aromatherapy training many years ago was not in vain.
1523 2018-03-05 20:38:42 Senator Cantwell, oil is nasty yucky stuff, we should take out of our earth ASAP
1524 2018-03-05 20:38:26 Canada oil and vehicles: It is about to loose on both on oil now in U.S` hands. Despite Auto pact, research is in U.S and main export/collaboration to China market goes through U.S. Historically, auto industry, Ford/G.M/Chryseler across the Detroit river belt was part of Canada.
1525 2018-03-05 20:38:09 I'm taking the million and giving her a buzz cut. Dump a whole bottle of Castor oil on her head and call it a day
1526 2018-03-05 20:38:08 Watching Mary Berry! It seems a bit 70’s cooking! Oil when making pancakes?? A bit too greasy for me sorry!
1527 2018-03-05 20:37:58 It was ok when it was the oil and gas sector,maybe they will notice when industries in Lieberal ridings start closibg up shop
1528 2018-03-05 20:37:56 DEAR SKIN CARE GURU'S, WHAT'S MORE EFFECTIVE THAN BIO OIL?
1529 2018-03-05 20:37:55 I'm dead serious also. I am approaching the best and working backward. I will update
1530 2018-03-05 20:37:49 I use light olive oil. It’s not as heavy in flavour and quite neutral for mayo making. Otherwise generally do the same as @JoannaBlythman in using other oils.
1531 2018-03-05 20:37:47 I mostly ignored the recipe and plopped yogurt in a bowl, added garlic, olive oil, lemon juice & a bit too much spice mix, marinated paneer & peppers for a few hours, kebabbed & popped in oven for 20 mins - spread paratha with mango chutney & added salad. BOOM
1532 2018-03-05 20:37:45 Just noticed today Cadbury chocolate has palm oil in it and not only that but less cocoa than a supermarket own brand thats cheaper.
1533 2018-03-05 20:37:36 Oh Mary, too much oil in your pan and not thick enough #pancakes #scotchpancakes #maryberry #classics
1534 2018-03-05 20:37:36 Yay, I’ve got all the essential oil questions correct.

1535 2018-03-05 20:37:31 Pedro Parente CEO of Petrobras says Presalt breakeven price of $30 to $40/B (Brent)  vs $70/B before downturn, lifting costs are down to $7/B.  Local content rules are better now. He is very optimistic about development #oil #CERAWeek
1536 2018-03-05 20:37:22 Oh def. OIL.
1537 2018-03-05 20:37:14 OPEC is worried that the lifting on drilling restrictions will propel the USA to oil Market Leader!  They wish they still had Obama to pay off for his restrictions!
1538 2018-03-05 20:37:10 To kill oil and move the Muslim shit in.
1539 2018-03-05 20:36:56 “Take the oil”. Who’s ME experts?
1540 2018-03-05 20:36:32 Two words:  mineral oil.

Dose your cat with a teaspoon every week or two, the puking will be eliminated. Some cats will lap it up from a tiny bowl, others require their mouths jacked open to pour it in. It's the active ingredient in most over the counter remedies.
1541 2018-03-05 20:36:23 Now we gotta get the rest of the Country to wake up and warm up to the benefits of Albert’s oil and gas.
1542 2018-03-05 20:36:17 Of course! <3 It can be iffy if one's skin reacts well with oil or not BUT if your skin loves oil like I've discovered mine does, it works absolute wonders.
1543 2018-03-05 20:36:12 Not have super high gas prices, lower oil prices, not gutting every element of government service, etc, etc
1544 2018-03-05 20:36:04 Stomach bug is horrible. :( I’m sorry. Peppermint essential oil is a lifesaver!
1545 2018-03-05 20:36:04 Yes! Or biscuits. Though you can substitute oil for eggs & it sometimes works if you're desperate.
1546 2018-03-05 20:36:03 Our Record is now 44-25! When the truck comes to pick up the oil from the west, one scarred hand to the Rangers blow it again.
1547 2018-03-05 20:35:58 The #oil and #gas industry needs more strategic partnerships - @petrobras CEO during @IHSMarkit @CERAWeek #CERAWeek18
1548 2018-03-05 20:35:58 I’m fine lol I’ve given you too much time today. Go oil your hair you reallly need to
1549 2018-03-05 20:35:36 one drop eucalyptus, a bit of olive oil, and lime juice... 

say goodbye to dandruff for a week
1550 2018-03-05 20:35:29 Let's just expedite the ending ! Besides oil s becoming less marketable as more cars & co's using other sources ( solar/wind/elec)
1551 2018-03-05 20:35:26 We gave our oil revenue away as tax breaks to already rich people who didn't think they were quite rich enough
1552 2018-03-05 20:35:20 Anyone who is dialed understands Putin and oil. Ask Netanyahu. He offered to suspend Isreali  gas sales to the Eu in exchange for Putin's support of Israel on the Iran deal. Anyone who REALLY wanted to punish Russia would sell gas.#MAGA
1553 2018-03-05 20:35:20 So im at the mechanic and theres this older couple and the lady keeps asking her husband “why are we here” he answers “we came to get an oil change on our car” and 5 minutes later she asks him the same question and everytime he answers in the same sweet way he did the 1st time

1555 2018-03-05 20:35:18 you may buy into this snake (or coconut) oil salesman, but I don't buy his act. His "ideas" are going to cost them games and delay/stall their progress in trying to rebuild.
1556 2018-03-05 20:35:17 Not the same, but I don’t have the painkillers the vet gives me as it gives liver damage over long term use. CBD oil doesn’t have that side effect.....use the oil over painkillers.
1557 2018-03-05 20:35:12 C'mon, what's a bot gotta do to get an oil fix around here?
1558 2018-03-05 20:35:09 It's baffling! They should be in movies, magazine, pornography, oil portraits, and the bloodlines of noble families.
1559 2018-03-05 20:35:02 Is there such a thing as using "too much" coconut oil? My armpit sweat is starting to smell like coconut but I can't tell if that means it's working or if that means I've put too much and now it's part of me and my blood is at least 30% SEVENHILLS ORGANIC EXTRA VIRGIN COCONUT OIL

@shainarae3714
1561 2018-03-05 20:34:53 Tillerson did the deal w Russia. But then Russia couldn’t get the oil out without going thru Ukraine. So they invaded. Connected to manafort too. The idea was to get US to back off Ukraine support so Russia could make $$. Who in the US was going to profit from that arrangement??
1562 2018-03-05 20:34:49 Top 10 smells in the world to me...the aroma of onion and garlic simmering in olive oil. A random snow day observation as I cook supper for later!!!
1563 2018-03-05 20:34:46 No-one is disputing brown is bad . However eat8mubg sat fat does not cause brown fat .   It's inflamed visceral fat that is disastrous and that is caused by high carb high refined foods high  seed oil diet not butter !
1564 2018-03-05 20:34:42 Oh ok. That plain buka one doesn't go with dodo. I just make mine like the regular beans. Ewa riro. But with no palm oil.
1565 2018-03-05 20:34:41 .@petrobras CEO Parente: when Libra #oil contract was signed, breakeven cost was pegged at $70-$72/bbl. Now, that’s down to $35. We have plans to get to $29. #CERAWeek18 #CERAWeek
1566 2018-03-05 20:34:36 I think as soon as i get home I'm gonna take some cbd oil to chill my head a bit
1567 2018-03-05 20:34:35 Of course pipelines makes sense, Canada is an exporter and most of our money comes from exporting oil. To cripple that is total ignorance. However I see no reason why Bitumen can't be refined to Crude before piping.  Refineries = more jobs & a better price for the end product
1568 2018-03-05 20:34:21 Signal problems persist on the southbound side of 36th Street (BROOKLYN), delaying service on the D, N, and R. Do you have dinner reservations? Which restaurant? Under what name? Do they cook with peanut oil? Because we're allergic.
1569 2018-03-05 20:34:13 Have you tried the coconut oil diet type thing?

1571 2018-03-05 20:33:56 I have now  My 28yo isn’t vegan, he loves his meat, but coconut oil/milk, fruit shakes with added protein, etc are his favourite ... protein makes him a bit stinky 
1572 2018-03-05 20:33:56 Shep falsely said only two percent of Chinese steel comes into the USA!!! Wrong, Chinese are fifty percent over domestic capacity and Chinese steel comes to the USA from Chinese steel exported to the EU, Canada and Mexico!! We whipped the Japanese by choking imported oil. Steel??
1573 2018-03-05 20:33:32 But will it support fish like off-shore oil rigs?  The rest of this debate is just noise until this question is answered.
1574 2018-03-05 20:33:20 Have you considered some butter and coconut oil in your coffee?
1575 2018-03-05 20:33:15 But then Norway has a Sovereign Wealth Fund of $1 trillion accrued by the taxation of oil and gas extraction. Where the UK has f*** all

$21 trillion sat in tax havens mind ...

1582 2018-03-05 20:32:07 Dietary guidelines advise limiting SF to< 7% of daily cal & adding more of poly & monounsaturated fats from nuts, seeds, avocado, fatty fish, olive and canola oil. The above conclusion missed talking about trans fats. TF not only increase d LDL, they also decrease HDL, d good fat
1583 2018-03-05 20:32:04 Same folks that say don't objectify women and "hey, my eyes are up here" now screaming for others to look at their bewbs.  Makes total sense.
1584 2018-03-05 20:31:30 I’m Puerto Rican and my family put sazon , adobo , salt and oil on everything and now we all have diabetes  as I got older I realized a lot of seasoning wasn’t needed but it was a force of habit cause of how I was taught.

1587 2018-03-05 20:31:16 Went to the gym, did a watercolour in my wet Lands series, bought some oil pastels, thought I’d try them out I haven’t used any for years and watched Ancient Aliens x
1588 2018-03-05 20:31:12 It's time for all levels of gov't, environmental leaders, municipalities, First Nations  & industry to find an EE solution.

1591 2018-03-05 20:30:55 CILANTRO OIL...YES PLEASE
1592 2018-03-05 20:30:37 its about time. Oil companies need to get on board if we want to meet our carbon reduction goals. But are they really on board?  Won't they be affected by the currently proposed carbon tax?

1594 2018-03-05 20:30:16 I bet you don’t have a person on your administration, who can check the oil in a car or change a tire.  We need a real leadership
1595 2018-03-05 20:30:15 Owning a train set and a seersucker hat doesn’t make you an engineer, bro.
1596 2018-03-05 20:30:14 OIL DIFF: 3.09 -> 3.13
1597 2018-03-05 20:30:13 If it's a freshly dug up tiny Jersey Royal swimming in oil or butter; it's just about acceptable. Otherwise they can fuck off.
1598 2018-03-05 20:30:10 So we will be at least 60 percent responsible for the harmful things that oil does to the environment.  Unlike President Trump and his cabinet, most Americans are looking to be responsible in this role.  We need to emphasize clean energy as we move forward.
1599 2018-03-05 20:30:05 Those cartridge oil pens put me on my ass last by 10 pm I was KO Ima need my issue today 
1600 2018-03-05 20:30:02 Oil has always been in the hands of dictators and also of Western countries that have installed dictators, So oil has never been a tool to control the world. Israel has its own state on the border before the occupation of 1967 and they have to implement all the UN resolutions.
1601 2018-03-05 20:29:38 You would be doing a huge service. 
We would not mass shootings. Kids would be safer. You would be doing your part as the American civilian that you believe you are. 
You're on to something. Run with it. Fly with the angels.

1608 2018-03-05 20:28:14 #kylefiles - people need to learn the difference and legalize CB oil. That is the medical cure.

Legalise for medical.

1613 2018-03-05 20:27:29 Wouldn't it be easier to take your gun crazy friends to some island and shoot each other? Well you do that now. Like when a vice pres shot someone in the face.

1619 2018-03-05 20:26:49 You should check if the lush bath bomb included olive oil. If so it makes sense why they rolled around the tub. Olives have the same effect as cat nip on cats. You have one sparkly stones cat.

1623 2018-03-05 20:26:27 You're accomplished exactly what was on the president's agenda. Good for you. It's just sad that you really did more harm to the country than good. We need people who care about the environment working at the EPA. Not Oklahoma attorney generals in bed with oil.
1624 2018-03-05 20:26:19 Agree. We need to faze out from oil and gas but draining our pockets through a tax will not help. What about the environmental ministries asbestos ban? 114 mil for no real changes in infra seems excessive to me. Opinion?
1625 2018-03-05 20:26:18 the mocha i got from cafe louis tastes like motor oil or something 
1626 2018-03-05 20:26:18 Olive oil does indeed play an important role in the rise of the corleone family. Olive oil, olive oil family, olive garden. Science.
1627 2018-03-05 20:26:16 I double checked: our two biggest exports are cars (12.6%) and oil (10.2%). Both are declining. And I do worry things will get worse. This is not fake news.
1628 2018-03-05 20:26:09 I was lying in bed this morning listening to the Doors right before I got up to go to work. I really need to oil those hinges.
1629 2018-03-05 20:26:07 More delusion.... there have been NO significant new oil finds for YEARS... it's about to run out...
1630 2018-03-05 20:26:01 Poor Jimmy Kimmel.  Not only was Oscars lowest rated of all-time, not only is his late night show suffering, but now rumor is that ABC is quietly exploring possibility of replacing him late night. He should have stuck to comedy instead of being the joke. @FoxNews @RealJamesWoods
1631 2018-03-05 20:25:58 Build more refineries so we can all enjoy this wonderful oil and lower prices at the gas pump!

1634 2018-03-05 20:25:45 Is casually looking at porn on Tumblr while waiting for an oil change a bad thing? 
1635 2018-03-05 20:25:44 Today is my cars treat yo self day, oil changed and nice car wash. You’re welcome my little mariner  sorry I treat you like shit
1636 2018-03-05 20:25:42 The key to understanding modern politics, and from this the modern World is the knowledge that J.D. Rockefeller was angry with Tsar Nicholas II for awarding the main Russian oil field development contract to Royal Dutch Shell and not Standard Oil.  That's it.
1637 2018-03-05 20:25:33 The country has been sold out by the 1 percent to the highest bidders, Russia and fossil fuel conglomerates. Wave goodbye to all our beautiful parks and wildlife areas. They will be destroyed by oil rigs and strip mines.
1638 2018-03-05 20:25:20 U.S. frenemy China crushed our steel and aluminum industries by dumping here. China is smart to make us dependent on them for the primary components of all of our war machines. Like oil, steel and aluminum are strategic, we need a good domestic supply chain. #tariffs
1639 2018-03-05 20:25:09 We already produce more oil than Russia so I don’t understand the math here

1641 2018-03-05 20:25:04 Just heard from @PPouyanne to start off #CERAWeek 2018, Total is investing in #LNG and oil, but must be low cost #oil, longer cycle (that spending can be ramped up and down), deep water  and Middle East all on radar
1642 2018-03-05 20:24:57 and then "inside Jimmy" and then it went to bonkers for even the censors and yet 6.4 million new barrels of oil that will be pumped outside Louie's new room near the Louie's Luncheonette in New Haven, Conn. simply speaks volumes to those who need no introduction....
1643 2018-03-05 20:24:48 What do you use to help the lies slip out of your mouth so smoothly? Coconut oil? Plain old corn oil? Just curious
1644 2018-03-05 20:24:44 And you revel in others' tears.  There is plenty of room in the clown car for engineers.

1653 2018-03-05 20:23:19 Woohoo let's destroy our ecosystem.  Fuck our beaches and our oceans.  We need more oil.  Except Florida, they won't touch Florida.
1654 2018-03-05 20:23:17 You should have identified as an oil rig today and stayed home!

1658 2018-03-05 20:22:37 Welcome to the good life. To think we all hated beans as children. But I still can't eat beans cooked with palm oil. So I cook my beans plain, and make a nice fish sauce to go with it. Àti dodo. Man!
1659 2018-03-05 20:22:18 Pharmaceutical companies do not want Cannibis oil to be made legal because then they couldn’t make cancer such a lucrative illness.  There could be an actual cure! They know this! Keep giving to cancer research and we probably have a cure already
1660 2018-03-05 20:22:18 I am on CBD oil for pain relief and mum would defo use cannabis oil (regulated!!) or CBD on herself if she needed to. There is a difference, but it needs regulating...to give standards.

1664 2018-03-05 20:22:07 Venezuela's economy is mostly capitalist, and suffers a tremendous amount of foreign meddling. Chavismo is a distinct improvement over what came before it, but you won't hear that in imperialist media, who are just itching for an excuse to take their oil. 
1665 2018-03-05 20:22:03 The two solutions to everything is coconut oil and a cup of tea .. just sayin' 
1666 2018-03-05 20:22:01 If we knew where we were going as a people, the "bunkering" wouldn't be illegal. Which means an environmental protection body would be monitoring the production. Govt would be taxing the oil processors. And there would be no soot to hide from #ATimidPeople
1667 2018-03-05 20:22:00 They make no sense.. soap is meant to strip dirt and oil from your hands. I find my hands to be more dry after

1675 2018-03-05 20:20:56 Silly man, there are no conventional storage mechanisms to make up what wind/solar can not produce. That's why they're backed up with Natural gas/oil plants. Comparing cars to power plants is inane.
1676 2018-03-05 20:20:54 Bro how much did OBJ sold oil. In his 8years. They always say buhari met nothing where is GEJ handover note. We are not shortsighted
1677 2018-03-05 20:20:51 944 has been dragged back into rotation. Turns out all the problems (not including wheel bearing or oil usage) were down to bad connection on the crappy old torpedo fuses. Need to give all those connections a tidy up someday.

1683 2018-03-05 20:20:15 Thank you @bingaswingas for 135 gallons of used cooking oil today! We will #recycle it into #biodiesel and it will be heating homes by #Friday!
1684 2018-03-05 20:20:09 I can never get those to work right. My general method (not with hasselback potatoes) is to sling them in the microwave for ten minutes, turning over halfway, then oven for ten mins with oil and salt to crisp the skin up
1685 2018-03-05 20:20:05 Those who would give up essential Cream, per glass, to purchase a little temporary Canelé, deserve neither Olive oil nor Trapdoor.

1690 2018-03-05 20:19:22 three days ago, changkyun was seen with his bottle of oil
1691 2018-03-05 20:19:21 Best oil for mayo is soybean oil but generally in the UK this is GM and is labelled as veg oil - as is rapeseed oil. All the large manufacturers use rapeseed oil. Groundnut best for shallow frying due to smoke point!

1709 2018-03-05 20:17:09 Check your Transmission oil this weekend.
1710 2018-03-05 20:17:06 Try tea tree oil . I know it works on stretch marks so it’s gotta work wonders on scars.
1711 2018-03-05 20:16:57 Hmm not off hand, but ideally, you don’t need crazy seasonings. Just salt pepper, some olive oil and you want to bake it at higher temp to crispy up the outside a little bit. Don’t want them mushy or undercooked. I usually air fry them and that’s 
1712 2018-03-05 20:16:35 Wow!! Game on for oil.

1714 2018-03-05 20:16:09 Aka, we’re waiting for the oil company to offer more money.  You’re disgustingly corrupt.
1715 2018-03-05 20:16:08 I do oil market intelligence (economic modeling, geopolitical forecasting etc), sell it to the new ventures/business development groups at the major IOCs.
1716 2018-03-05 20:16:06 About time we have more oil than any other country in the nation world.

1720 2018-03-05 20:15:37 I do that every night  also, idk if you’ve heard of ‘oil pulling’ where you rinse your mouth with coconut oil. I’ve been doing that lately, it’s been proven to have many dental benefits.

1728 2018-03-05 20:14:46 You are welcome.  Thanks for the information.  Oil!  WTI, I said would hold above $60 and hit $70 May-June in 2018.

1757 2018-03-05 20:12:34 Seriously? That is awesome! Really didn't want to look at oil rigs when running on roads above town. Well, and have oil rigs above the Yellowstone.
1758 2018-03-05 20:12:34 So, prove it.
1759 2018-03-05 20:12:27 What oil did you use??
1760 2018-03-05 20:12:27 .@Total CEO Pouyanne: on recent Libya #oil buy, we spent less than $1/bbl for reserves. Yes, there are risks, but that’s now an option in our portfolio. #CERAWeek18 #ceraweek
1761 2018-03-05 20:12:15 Can't fight without oil, which Germany was cut off from and a reason for attacking east. Can't run warships, tanks, planes, trucks, etc. Same with Japan, which was the reason they attacked the US: they were running out of oil.
1762 2018-03-05 20:12:08 You do know that oil as a source of energy is on the way out, right? But, yeah, cool.
1763 2018-03-05 20:11:52 Two words. Oil Money

1770 2018-03-05 20:11:09 Guns are toys.  Gun culture has a tradgedy if the commson problem, and like so many such TOTC issues, the commoners such as this self-described engineer, refuse to acknowledge the impact their hobby has in the rest of our society, and is convinced he isn’t part of it.

1774 2018-03-05 20:10:39 Does someone know gas conversion usage vs oil in li for a home. Not the install just what current gas per month bill is roughly
1775 2018-03-05 20:10:19 After being high off oil for like a week straight, flower has absolutely no effect.
1776 2018-03-05 20:10:15 A winter storm is predicted for March 7th. Please check your generators to make sure they're functioning properly. Check that the switch is in the auto position, oil level is between the hash marks, and that there are no error messages, yellow or red nights.

1779 2018-03-05 20:10:05 We sell those goods here in the United States driving our economy, which seems to be doing ok with the current imbalance. And these issues have been going on for decades.

1781 2018-03-05 20:09:48 What does short-cycle #oil mean? To Total, it means having flexibility to turn on and off capex says @ppouyanne. #CERAWeek
1782 2018-03-05 20:09:47 Thanks Fabian. I agree that chilli works very well with this. Sometimes fresh or indeed a good chilli oil.
1783 2018-03-05 20:09:46 Did you just say Coconut oil and Palm oil contain cholesterol? 
1784 2018-03-05 20:09:44 I'm super into this massage bar w black pepper oil, and also we just had a nice Japanese gin w black pepper, and now I'm like "maybe pepper in everything?!"

1786 2018-03-05 20:09:36 This is how Trump made his fortune. Snake oil, cons & fraud. Buy a $1-billion property, short-change all the subcontractors, pay only $250,000. His bigger con? The US presidency. He’s also doing it with tariffs. Don’t get ripped off, allies.
1787 2018-03-05 20:09:31 I currently take one a day multivitamin for women. Any particulate brand of evening primrose oil that you recommend?

1790 2018-03-05 20:09:08 RT @SenatorCantwell: Oil drilling and exploration off the Pacific Northwest coastline, or an oil spill from drilling anywhere along the Pacific coast, poses threats to the fishing, shellfish, and tourism industries at the heart of Washington’s economy. #StopOffshoreDrilling

1797 2018-03-05 20:07:52 Close. That they won't lose in regulation. Similar to double chance... win or tie. Force the Oil to beat them in reg.
1798 2018-03-05 20:07:52 BFD, we've been the world's largest oil producer many times, and for years we've EXported more oil than IMported oil.  You should know that, after all you're the expert on everything, aren't you?

1916 2018-03-05 19:54:40 Seed oils were introduced in the late 1800s, with the detoxification of cottonseed oil. They'd been around for a long time before nutrition science got going around WWII. Very little research done comparing low n-6 diets to high, almost all compares high to high.

1925 2018-03-05 19:53:29 Using oil diffusers in homes can cause fatal illness in dogs and cats. I hope she’s using it in a large space.
1926 2018-03-05 19:53:14 I've been using olive oil drops so hopefully that will work but I'll definitely try that too.
1927 2018-03-05 19:52:55 After i finish doing my oil change i need to fuck up an essay thats due tomorrow and i have yet to start it  i got this 
1928 2018-03-05 19:52:37 You have been using these people as your podium for years. The blame lies with you progressives. Without them you have no agenda to oil your corrupt machine. People are not stupid, you would have fixed this when you had all the chips. If you were interested.

1930 2018-03-05 19:52:29 I just saw an Indian woman on @uglydelicious make fried chicken with Parachute coconut oil and I can’t wrap my head around the fact that the oil is actually edible and NOT formulated for hair
1931 2018-03-05 19:52:23 Horrified to hear about the oil spill on @TheLeaRC 's gorgeous patch of river. :(
1932 2018-03-05 19:52:19 Apart from coconut oil being freaking expensive - yup sounds good.
1933 2018-03-05 19:52:05 @jiffylube I can honestly say I only visit Jiffy Lube as a last resort and cringe every time I do. $80 for an oil change?  #RipOffLube more like it. Go anywhere but here if you have a choice.
1934 2018-03-05 19:52:01 Went to a vegetable oil refinery this morning.   Lost all desire to eat anything fried for at least 2 or 3 days
1935 2018-03-05 19:51:56 Same thing in oil country...
1936 2018-03-05 19:51:48 Saw them yesterday. Great black solid lumps that we thought might be from an old oil slick maybe. Intriguing.
1937 2018-03-05 19:51:36 Ever heard about bio oil? Asians love applying strange things to their skin. They must have a remedy
1938 2018-03-05 19:51:27 Lift up women, then in next statement diminish and disparage women. Leftism really requires one to be bipolar to avoid the mental conflict .
1939 2018-03-05 19:51:23 Constituted by rigged elections and oil Wells received by faith.
1940 2018-03-05 19:50:40 I think like a child Italia is corrupted USA is corrupted and all those with Nations agreed your greeds power oil WAR just for your own fucking killing plan.

1943 2018-03-05 19:50:29 This turned out great didn’t it fuckin oil slick head
1944 2018-03-05 19:50:28 My problem with cast iron is you're not supposed to wash it; washing it removes the protective coating of oil that makes it be non-stick, but it's not non-stick in my reality, so it must be washed and scrubbed to get it clean, so it needs to be seasoned every time, or....
1945 2018-03-05 19:50:25 "Turkey is fighting against IS"
Really!? Let me teach you something boy:
 Boosting isis economy by buying oil they stole is not the same as fighting them... Get it!?

You're welcome...
1946 2018-03-05 19:49:58 Oil workers back to work .Thank God for President Trump He Rocks .btw .my son was not the only man who lost their jobs and went back to work
1947 2018-03-05 19:49:51 I didn't expect anything weird, I've never seen anything like it. Actually I was expecting something like a jellied oil. Thickened baby oil comes to mind.
1948 2018-03-05 19:49:50 Well I just know since I have dry skin that if I use that after I get out of the shower and before I do my makeup it feels and looks better! Virgin coconut oil is the bomb
1949 2018-03-05 19:49:37 Nice beard. What oil ?
1950 2018-03-05 19:49:23 Well maybe that means that hundreds of thousands of industrial  Oil and Gas field Workers that lost their jobs over the past five years we'll get them back. Thank you Mr. Obama for destroying America's oil gas and coal industry and he almost destroyed our logging industry

1953 2018-03-05 19:49:13 Need oil for my car too now. Ffs
1954 2018-03-05 19:49:03 Should throw a tariff on all the electricity we sell them Or gas ,oil, iron ore that they will now need to produce their steel
1955 2018-03-05 19:48:51 Don’t believe government is capable of using carbon tax to do any good. It created a drag on economy. Oil and gas will eventually be fazed out. Forcing premature tech to replace it In my opinion will possible prolonged oil and gas reliance. $ on R&D not subsidies.
1956 2018-03-05 19:48:50 Let me Explain my son Mike worked on a oil rig .no thanks to Obama put him out of work .Trump became President and that month signed putting
1957 2018-03-05 19:48:48 Over a much shorter time horizon than people expect (3-5 years). It already makes economic sense to use uber exclusively w human drivers in very rural locations, when it’s autonomous we’re toast. Btw awesome to meet a fellow oil pro, what kind of role?
1958 2018-03-05 19:48:34 اللهم صلي وسلم عليه
1959 2018-03-05 19:48:09 Not with the reliance of crude oil diminishing.  But what ever makes you look good to your drop out viewers.
1960 2018-03-05 19:47:50 Venezuela is the largest oil producer owned now by Russia.
1961 2018-03-05 19:47:48 The IEA forecast is like a timebomb ticking away for oil making OPEC cuts totally irrelevant along with all those silly pipeline games.
1962 2018-03-05 19:47:34 Drilling activity is up because oil prices are going up.  #IHFA Ag commodities are in a glut, but the worst might be over.  Corporate profits also rising.  Manufacturing is going up,  highest in 14 years. Service sector also doing well.
1963 2018-03-05 19:47:31 They don't die for our freedoms. They die for oil and the military industrial complex. Poor Americans used for the rich to make $. They have my immense sympathy, not my respect.
1964 2018-03-05 19:47:19 Just spent 26 minutes sitting in the floor in target researching where different brands of peanut butter source their palm oil from and this is why grocery shopping takes me 5 years
1965 2018-03-05 19:46:54 Have you tried using coconut oil?
1966 2018-03-05 19:46:50 Men pls use beard oil I can’t stress it enough honestly 
1967 2018-03-05 19:46:42 Behind vs in front of the meter. Same issue exists with metered volumes data here with respect to oil sands cogen. Behind the fence loads aren't in.
1968 2018-03-05 19:46:33 I gave out soooo much oil paint last year and I kind of regret it now 
1969 2018-03-05 19:46:32 Nothing like going to get your oil changed and walking out with a $300 bill 
1970 2018-03-05 19:46:25 LADIES PSA!!!! stop spending your money on makeup remover/facial moisturizer!!!!! I have been using coconut oil (a 14 ounce jar for $6) for over a month and there isn’t even a dent in the jar, and my face is the clearest it has ever been and my lashes have grown extensively!!!!!
1971 2018-03-05 19:46:21 every time i get my oil change they tell me 80 more problems w the car lol@fuck
1972 2018-03-05 19:46:12 While attempting to make more soap with coconut oil as a base this time... I found out I’m allergic to it! Great now to find an alternative... any recommendations? #fndcore2018
1973 2018-03-05 19:45:46 Janelle replying Nat Geo I think you are only way to get thru to these Trump supporters.  He caving to big oil just like NRA on assault rifles money is the base of all desisions made.
1974 2018-03-05 19:45:46 Stir together 1/3 cup basil with 2 quarts chew. Blend with Olive Oil. Set aside for 3 days Serve over kale.

1976 2018-03-05 19:45:12 Add some Lemon Oil to your baking soda for a fresh lemony scent!
1977 2018-03-05 19:45:09 Performative healthiness.Reminds me of when I tried to explain that deep frying things in olive oil is unnecessary...yeah didn’t go well
1978 2018-03-05 19:45:00 It explains why Oil went up today, not stocks
1979 2018-03-05 19:44:53 They've got billions in oil revenue to make with putin. #TrumpRussiaConspiracy Original Sin.
1980 2018-03-05 19:44:45 It would surprise me thesedays if under the Neo-Tories #British #ArmedForces could secure a Tennis Court from a protection racket not alone an oil well in interests of British people, this Tory Govt has destroyed any credibility Britain once had, Tories are beyond joke @RTUKnews
1981 2018-03-05 19:44:43 @HelenAnderz hope this helps but I suffer from cluster migraines so badly, I started putting grapefruit oil on my temples in the morning and I now rarely get them, also helps with nausea if you put it on your tummy 
1982 2018-03-05 19:44:36 Dx by blood genetic test (still in study phases so findings have not been released yet but they’re consistent with his symptoms). On TC Senior for low NSC, Dac Oil for fat, working up to higher protein (ordered pea protein isolate and mixing in Nutrena Empower Balance)
1983 2018-03-05 19:44:27 You do realise that oil use is on its way down right? The rest of the world is moving on while trumps stuck in the 80s. It’s going to cause a glut, lower prices and suddenly not be economical to get. Trumps then going to waste taxpayer money propping up a failed industry.
1984 2018-03-05 19:44:23 To bad the state of California doesn’t want oil production in our state
1985 2018-03-05 19:44:17 exfoliating at least twice a week, and vitamin e oil
1986 2018-03-05 19:44:06 It will happen much sooner.. a lot of speculative longs are trying to keep it above certain techincal levels..but it never works. it always collapsesas fundamentals are worsening..supply just keeps going up now and in the future.
1987 2018-03-05 19:43:52 FX rate was already declining prior to elections lol and thats largely determined by global oil prices albeit the buhari govt caused a dollar scarcity by pegging it below its true value to save face.
1988 2018-03-05 19:43:50 Thank you for the tips! I've heard that peppermint oil helps. I'll definitely have to give it a try
1989 2018-03-05 19:43:50 Essential oil diffusers are just incense for soccer moms that have subconscious misgivings about brown people
1990 2018-03-05 19:43:36 Whoever wrote the Dossier OR gave Steele the info KNEW the Russian Govt was shopping around a 20% stake in Rosneft. Who could have known that? Tons of people in the Oil and Gas industry and the banking sector. Even a Ex-WSJ journalist with friends back at the paper.....Simpson?
1991 2018-03-05 19:43:32 If corn oil is made from corn, and vegetable oil is made from vegetables, what is baby oil made from?

1999 2018-03-05 19:42:44 Yeah, that was also when the deflationistas kicked in. Then it was the oil price fall that "has to be telling us something"
2000 2018-03-05 19:42:37 Any of y'all tried puttin truffle oil in your hair?
2001 2018-03-05 19:42:29 US to be out of oil in 4 years.
2002 2018-03-05 19:42:29 Neem oil applied every day or two. Ladybugs. Spiders.
2003 2018-03-05 19:42:20 Big oil countries, including Russia, Japan, China and the United States, are exploring vast frozen gas reserves (aka methane hydrates) in the Arctic Circle. This could not only lead to turf battles but the recovery process could release huge methane emissions into the atmosphere.
2004 2018-03-05 19:42:09 There are some strong criticisms of Canada's oil sands being one of the world's biggest environmental disasters. I confess I don't know if true, but it is a huge energy user.
2005 2018-03-05 19:41:52 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.
2006 2018-03-05 19:41:43 LOL your kidding me !... he was as slow as a wet week & like an oil tanker turning he was that slow
2007 2018-03-05 19:41:00 Have you tried either? I read about coconut oil online too 
2008 2018-03-05 19:40:50 Expensive oil change - work truck and tools maybe - not in any shape today
2009 2018-03-05 19:40:35 He nailed the shift from natural gas to oil with EOG. When he speaks, I'm definitely going to listen. Time will tell if he gets this one as well, but I'd lean towards yes today.

2015 2018-03-05 19:40:10 He's a self-proclaimed expert: businessman, scientist, oil industry, polling company, asset management, laundry, steel and NHS recruitment. Well-used to glossing over problems with sound-bites and is a 'Master of Nothing'. Superficial climber.
2016 2018-03-05 19:40:00 Jack used to tell me about a political strategy called " good cop,bad cop" take both sides of an issue to get votes! I called him a snake oil salesmen,dishonest and ruthless,he just smiled" all that matters is winning" NDP policy!

2019 2018-03-05 19:39:53 Just to be clear...... Oil companies have shown no interest in providing Canadians with fuel unless taxpayers help them out.
2020 2018-03-05 19:39:49 WTF WHY DOES IT TAKE SO LONG TO CHANGE OIL I HATE CARS FUCK
2021 2018-03-05 19:39:42 now she's talking about going to get a oil change

I’m sure that’s why he gets so many infections.I’m guessing as you’re being so closely monitored you can’t give him cannabis oil. Soo many positive results in children. Keep fighting

2056 2018-03-05 19:36:08 People you need to understand, we must produce our own steel and aluminum.  I know most of these people are just afraid!  I am not, I am ready for our country to be #1 in oil/gas & produce its own steel & aluminum!  We will be so much better off...just wait!!
2057 2018-03-05 19:36:06 "Watch the news this week." Q
Four BOOMS coming?
Hannity tweeted a BOOM a little while ago. The U.S. will become the world's top oil producer in five years.
That was predicted in Mark Taylor's, "The Trump Prophecies."
2058 2018-03-05 19:36:00 China? Like the same China that is well behind us on switching from burning coal to nat gas? Besides, even with more clean energy, oil will be in high demand for our lifetimes. You can be happy about both!

2064 2018-03-05 19:35:25 Anything to protect for outside is good, danish oil is awsome, but needs repeated as weather beats em up. My father was a huge fan of waterlox tung oil, with 10/12 coats. He is gone, but his stuff still looks good, and impervious to water.
2065 2018-03-05 19:35:21 Venezuela has been a mess and had hyper-inflation since 1980 when Reagan manipulated the oil prices with OPEC in order to destroy Russia’s economy.  70% of its economy is private sector - about the same as Denmark.  And Denmark is doing quite well.
2066 2018-03-05 19:35:13 Russians changed Leningrad citys name pulled down statues.That brutal Commie thought destroyed nations. Latest being Venezuela with all oil resources. For opposing BJP, you don't have to be slaves of Mass murders and their rejected ideology.Kamal is one more ChrIslamist Commie.

2074 2018-03-05 19:34:30 Kind of the same shit that Goldman Sachs pulled off in Libya just prior to gaddhafi downfall. They plied the gaddhafi men with hookers and five star hotels. Libya is now suing to get their oil money back
2075 2018-03-05 19:34:08 Japan needs oil  Iran needs to pronounce the names of American baseball players who've gone to Japan
2076 2018-03-05 19:34:07 Somebody could’ve told me that Subaru oil changes were $80
2077 2018-03-05 19:33:53 Tillerson really wants those oil leases to be acted on.
2078 2018-03-05 19:33:44 I personally know two other drivers who are homeless and sleep in their car. UBER doesn't even pay for your oil change or gas which will come out from that $7 an hour in SF area. They advertise $25 hr but it's a lie

2087 2018-03-05 19:33:06 Trump's love for Russia or should I say Putin is very suspicious.  What President would support a country that did the election meddling, secretly give N. Korea oil which is against the sanctions, and colluded to win over Hillary Clinton. Comey and Russians helped Trump to win.
2088 2018-03-05 19:33:06 my skin just soaked up some @josie_maran argan oil like I’ve been without water for a week. or I just live in New England #beauty #thebest
2089 2018-03-05 19:32:57 Fish Lips Says 'Irrelevant as new tech coming out which US has. Oil demand to decrease over that short period of time and become very cheap' 
2090 2018-03-05 19:32:24 No it’s not. You’re forgetting they haven’t gotten a raise in years. Raise should offset healthcare increases. Instead of giving tax breaks to oil and gas companies - fund WV Emp healthcare and education.
2091 2018-03-05 19:32:24 Coconut oil or Dove soap?
2092 2018-03-05 19:32:10 Is it normally more oily? Drink water only and wash your face twice a day,try witch hazel to cleanse at night,exfoliate every their day to clean your pores more and put a little oil on daily to moisturize
2093 2018-03-05 19:32:06 It has actually helped reduce my gas usage. 5 gallons of 93 Octane got me about 10 hours using the factory oil, now I'm getting 13-14 hours out of that same fillup with @AMSOILINC on board.
2094 2018-03-05 19:32:06 It's the oil spill.
2095 2018-03-05 19:32:05 Where have all the rail lines, cars and engines been lost to? Shipping tarsands oil. Unprocessed crap from a hole in the ground, the Canada doesn't process to improve. Canada doesn't get it; we need to create value, not sell raw materials that others get rich off of.
2096 2018-03-05 19:32:03 The frequency of oil and gas well blowouts seems to have increased in recent years says Pascal Ray at ERIC. #IRMI2018.
2097 2018-03-05 19:32:03 Now, the cooking budget video I watch by Gordon Ramsey was dope but I feel like he forgets he’s a millionaire. I literally don’t have any of the shit he cooking “laying around” my house besides like salt, pepper, garlic, paprika, cooking oil 
2098 2018-03-05 19:31:57 American Trump is crying fowl play to bad trade deal, while Nigerian leaders continue to protect wickedness called trade against own people. How shameless; 7th world largest oil producer importing petroleum. Why do we need NNPC if we must import,  afterall we import also GenSets
2099 2018-03-05 19:31:54 we need to ween ourselves OFF of oil. we need to also invest in to alternative energy

2102 2018-03-05 19:31:47 Face oil! Don’t be scared! Dry oil can help your skin from over producing oil if you have stripped it with cleansing and physical exfoliating. If your skin is dry, oils will push lines and wrinkles back years.

2108 2018-03-05 19:31:02 Such an interesting article! Not many people think about how trade effects oil prices, but the connection is pretty clear!
2109 2018-03-05 19:30:47 Most of most of the benefit from tax reform is increased value of deferred tax credits. This makes oil company balance sheets look better but does not add to cash flows. Increased cash flow from higher ROIC will push shares higher for investors.
2110 2018-03-05 19:30:43 What oil do u use to fry? Ive grown off the taste of regular fried eggs but frying it in sesame oil makes it taste sooooo much better for me.

2121 2018-03-05 19:29:39 I get them really bad. I find caffeine can help, peppermint oil on the head (@SajeWellness makes a great one called peppermint halo), but mostly I just need a nap or period of time with sensory deprivation to "reset". I've been going to massage therapy which has helped too!
2122 2018-03-05 19:29:24 Climate change has been with us forever. That’s a proven fact. Another fact is we still import 60% of our oil.  America is not self sustaining.  Electricity is not free. That’s another fact.. politicians mislead the public.
2123 2018-03-05 19:29:18 Then why are you using Russian steel in the oil pipelines, is it because they’re done on the cheap which is why they keep leaking?
2124 2018-03-05 19:29:16 I have a friend that works in oil & gas and makes $$$ and when we "split" the bill while out, he will ask me to Venmo him any little tiny difference "your drink was technically $1-2 more than mine"... Why does he always say we should split then!? 
2125 2018-03-05 19:29:04 Did PDP has any moral right to talk of corruptionin Nigeria? What did they do when they were in power and oil at over $100? How I wish there could be another strong party
2126 2018-03-05 19:28:58 This one time in middle school we had to write news articles for the school website and this one girl wrote about how an oil company in town was polluting the air/water and she wasn’t allowed to publish it bc the company gave the school a lot of money
2127 2018-03-05 19:28:57 I generally buy Plus brand and CW Hemp. I do order from Green Mountain because their direct from farm thus less expensive. I've tried their product and it works better than any brand I've tried. There is 1 company claiming testing and best product but I feel it's snake oil.

2134 2018-03-05 19:28:12 Casing and tubing strings are the main parts of the well construction. All wells drilled for the purpose of oil or gas production (or injecting materials into underground formations) must be cased with material with sufficient strength and functionality.

2143 2018-03-05 19:27:19 I was frying something, freaked out when it popped a bit, accidentally hit the pot with one hand which splashed boiling oil on the other.

2159 2018-03-05 19:25:28 Lovely, that's how I make my own spaghetti sauce; just buy some cherry tomatoes, throw them in a pan with some oil until they render down. Add a little bit of fish sauce, pepper, truffle salt. Serve it with spaghetti. Absolutely delicious and so simple to make

2176 2018-03-05 19:22:56 interesting to note how oil & gas shills like notley have adopted all the terminology once used to criticize them: 'sustainable' .. 'diversification' .. 'responsible' .. 'ethical' .. etc etc
2177 2018-03-05 19:22:56 No, because of fracking. Eliminating coal can and should happen...but oil will be integral to the world for a long time

2184 2018-03-05 19:22:19 That's interesting. Considering US has been relying on the petrodollar to sustain the economy, & which also greatly risks the economic national security. US went to war with Iraq & Libya after they threatened to trade oil in other currencies. Huge task to take on the globalists.

2197 2018-03-05 19:20:49 "Artisan" buns mk 3 turned out well. Honey good. One egg fine. Might put a bit of oil back. Mostly I learned that to make any bread like this fluffier, I need to work with wetter dough, which is hard, but I shall try next time.
2198 2018-03-05 19:20:33 A variable worth considering is the carrier oil.  Hemp seed oil aids in absorption due to the presence of arachidonic acid.  Coco and olive oil, not so much.  Good luck.
2199 2018-03-05 19:20:28 What happened to the 800 million they allegedly have in reserve through bond sales, never spent? A milking of the taxpayers for more?
2200 2018-03-05 19:20:13 @tacobelluk Just been to visit your Rotherham Dalton branch, this is the first and only time anybody has bothered to mention that the fries and nachos are cooked in the same oil as the chicken. How can these therefore be part of the vegetarian options???
2201 2018-03-05 19:20:08 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.
2202 2018-03-05 19:19:56 They're both from the neoconservative school of big oil. People I suspect think Trump is a traitor are also keenly aware of the personal benefits they may receive as big players in oil and gas should Tillerson faciltate Russian extraction and export.
2203 2018-03-05 19:19:53 Coal. Oil and GAS are God's guift to the Human Race It is a source of energy to sustain us for many more generations at the same time releasing Carbon to grow more food and to produce more Oxygen
2204 2018-03-05 19:19:50 I pray the oil ends in Nigeria soonest. Hopefully that will help us pay more attentions to key areas to be developed"human capacity"And hopefully,the end of oil might reduced the level of corruption.Oil is a curse and it has brought nothing to Nigerians rather benefit select few
2205 2018-03-05 19:19:42 Iran-Contra? Ronnie secretly selling arms to IRAN? GW's Gulf War for the sake of defense contractors and assumed oil  (lots of Americans dead & injured), the economy collapse in 2008 .... nice that the GOP is party of no responsibility
2206 2018-03-05 19:19:41 Whole home Generac is the way to go. They do require regular interval maintenance; oil changes, batteries, regulators. But, when power goes, even while sleeping, they kick on. Hands free.
2207 2018-03-05 19:19:37 Made Timmy come with me to get my tire fixed and an oil change, all I had to do was tell him we’d get food after 
2208 2018-03-05 19:19:32 There's a scene in the Michael Keaton film 'Mr Mom' where he throws some crispy noodles into a pan of oil - similar whooshy explosion to the Vesta Volcano - hilarious!!
2209 2018-03-05 19:19:30 @omar_nidawi Baghdad should do its part and move back to more moderate draft of oil agreement #MEIIraq
2210 2018-03-05 19:19:27 Well he's played 4 years of div.3 hockey and has 6 playoff points. But that probably doesn't even matter to Oil fans anyways.
2211 2018-03-05 19:19:15 I know I wanted to be out at Twist tonight and decided what I want to wear, but let’s see how I feel after sitting in traffic for an hour, shower, wash and oil up my hair, durag, have a cup of tea and consult my wallet.

2214 2018-03-05 19:18:50 Of course, Putin and his boss wanted Rexxon in there, to pump that oil out of the ocean. Among other things Im sure. The complicit GOP, needs to throw in the towel and take there consequences. And in a hurry!
2215 2018-03-05 19:18:40 I am Have A Oil Sea
2216 2018-03-05 19:18:40 Lamp oil, rope, bombs? You want it? It's yours, my friend, as long as you have enough rubies.
2217 2018-03-05 19:18:32 @omar_nidawi KRG oil reserves are down, recognizes need to make agreement with Baghdad after independence failure #MEIIraq
2218 2018-03-05 19:18:31 you can go nearer in time and ask who was responsible for the 3day week in the 70s oil traders profiting off the opec induced oil crisis or the unions ?

most people get that wrong because of what they read in the paper at the time
2219 2018-03-05 19:18:25 หวงก้าง
2220 2018-03-05 19:18:25 Coal. Oil and GAS are God's guift to the Human Race It is a source of energy to sustain us for many more generations at the same time releasing Carbon to grow more food and to produce more Oxygen to breth.
2221 2018-03-05 19:18:22 I started using rosemary oil in my hair and the smell is just sooo strong.
2222 2018-03-05 19:18:21 While your oil poor country does slant oil drilling into Syria? Follow the money and save me the crocodile tears  about missiles being fired.
2223 2018-03-05 19:18:19 Getting oil to tide water is a petty disagreement??  Its in our NATIONAL INTEREST!!  Helps pay for YOUR doctors salary, as well as your childrens education!  Thats petty??
2224 2018-03-05 19:18:12 speculation on commodities are anticipating large demand reducing global oversupply fueled by 8 years of low rates. And I'm trading my trades the speculation in oil, gasoline, gold, treasuries is wrong going forward.

2231 2018-03-05 19:17:30 @realDonaldTrump You may be right. But I say, release the "free energy' patents from the past 80 years. The military uses free energy technology for a long time, & the 'Secret Space Program,' (SSP) also.  The Public is held hostage by the Cabal for our money.  Oil is obsolete.
2232 2018-03-05 19:17:23 how do you know if you need a oil change 
2233 2018-03-05 19:17:18 there used to be a sign at the Royal Artillery museum that said 'Do Not Touch This Gun - the oil on your fingers is destroying it!'
2234 2018-03-05 19:17:14 Achievable only by opening the shores of every state from Maine all the way around to Washington state - with the possible exception of Florida - to drilling. Remember the BP oil spill in the Gulf in 2010?
2235 2018-03-05 19:17:14 "Original Belfast since  455AD".
Neither Belfast, nor that flag, existed then. 
Fantasists, self deluded idiots, or just power hungry, media manipulating, snake oil sales team?

America made BP pay for oil spill, it shd make Dow Chemicals pay its Bhopal victims.
2238 2018-03-05 19:16:50 ya girl thought an oil change cost $20 y’all. it does not.

2252 2018-03-05 19:15:07 Ha! I could give you a list as long as my arm — final straw was two major oil leaks after I had just repaired a different oil leak. It was fun to drive when it worked, but it was the last BMW I’ll ever own. 
2253 2018-03-05 19:15:03 Yeppers, I know it helps to clear up the nose. I just had a little bit of fragrance oil actually ON my nose and even washing it off, still smelt.

2261 2018-03-05 19:14:31 Concrete and construction materials are cheap, oil could work, although I  don't think it would be irradiated enough to make it worth in  absorbing radiation. Orion used oil to reduce vaporization of the pusher plate.

2273 2018-03-05 19:13:35 Oil production in Canada and Alberta are at record high levels.

Nothing is being "imperilled"
2274 2018-03-05 19:13:21 This is the same in my dept. I am one of two hourly employees, and we have to take sick/PTO for every little thing. Salary folks only have to show up for 4 hours to count as a "day". BUT they're also expected to burn the midnight oil. I leave at 5 on the dot, no questions asked.
2275 2018-03-05 19:12:39 #BMWCanada @BMW stating that the warranty on the timing chain and oil pump drive chain has been extended to 7 years/70,000 miles and that if you have paid for repairs for either of these BMW may reimburse the costs. IS this true???
2276 2018-03-05 19:12:35 i put too much tee tree oil in this face mask and i can't stop crying
2277 2018-03-05 19:12:28 I added an egg and some milk as part of the liquid plus nice olive oil. Never done sourdough but I bet it would be lovely. Would definately say cook the leeks long & slow or they stay quite strong/harsh
2278 2018-03-05 19:12:25 Hey Sean, serious question here. Why, if we "gave" rights to oil & gas companies to drill on federal land, are we allowing them to export said oil and gas. Methinks our reserves should be used here? No? I think it is an excellent question that I would like to see you take up.
2279 2018-03-05 19:12:23 Boycott Big Oil. When we fill up at small independent gas stations it takes pennies away from Oil Co. if millions of us do this it adds up!

2284 2018-03-05 19:11:45 The U.S. being energy independent is one of the prophecies stated in Mark Taylor's book, "The Trump Prophecies." Also, The U.S. and Israel are to become the top producers of oil. Shale.

2289 2018-03-05 19:11:28 You need to read your history a little. America is the reason Iran became this way.  Look into the overthrow of their government in 1953 and how many people were killed because of it. Blood and Oil.
2290 2018-03-05 19:11:25 Let the oil dry, please! So, we could probably start using our heads!

2310 2018-03-05 19:08:58 You'd need to cover a large area in this concrete, perhaps impractically so as the rocket gains altitude and showers a larger surface with radiation.
Perhaps the better option is to use a neutron absorbing oil that you recover and 'clean' after each launch, instead of concrete?

2355 2018-03-05 19:03:54 How the key people who were instrumental in starting the Iraq war, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Condoleezza Rice, can sleep at night evades me. Bush was just a front man. They had to know there were no weapons of mass destruction. They had to. Just an excuse to control Middle East oil.
2356 2018-03-05 19:03:50 Hey miss Freeland,  place a tarrif on American farm produce  and let this @realDonaldTrump know the price of canadian oil and lumber just went up .enough of this goofy president

2361 2018-03-05 19:02:47 I think that’s a fair representation of her stance. As is the original tweet. 

Brexit is a disaster, Scexit is all unicorns and universal income and a Noway-style oil fund.
2362 2018-03-05 19:02:38 The rich are the people with billions of dollars from exploitation of financial markets, oil profits, and central banking where they can literally print their own money. The extremely rich aren't more hardworking than the rest of us; they don't contribute to society. They're lazy
2363 2018-03-05 19:02:32 The only thing that ever kept oil from breaking through for 10-12 hours was Milk of Mag… which is bad. 

So good but bad.
2364 2018-03-05 19:02:27 Which one is it, corruption caused the recession or fall in oil prices?

2365 2018-03-05 19:02:27 I’m fine with tomato, but like no oil at all???

Further, the Qur’an also mentions every living thing is made of water. Every living thing can be made up of either wood, stone, copper, aluminum, steel, silver, gold, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, oil, water, etc.

2386 2018-03-05 19:00:21 Hey wait a minute. Plus steel tariffs to raise the cost to drill oil
2387 2018-03-05 19:00:14 Hey madam minister Freeland. Slap tarrifs on American farm produce. And let trump know ,the price of canadian oil just went up.i think canadians have had enough of this @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews  goofs

2392 2018-03-05 18:59:50 American Revolutionary war - US/Britain/France - who won that trade war? no one... Britain went totally bankrupt in addition to losing it... trade imbalance is normal. For instance, for every $8 spent on oil in Saudi Arabia $5 comes back to the US in the form of an investment.
2393 2018-03-05 18:59:35 Argan oil is so good. Made my hair really nice. I cut it all off over 1 1/2  year ago so it can grow out nice again. It's okay but at a certain length my hair just starts to get so thin that it won't grow any longer. But long hair is too annoying for me that's why i keep it short
2394 2018-03-05 18:59:25 Too bad you don’t get some Western Canadian grain and oil moving so you could pay for it.
2395 2018-03-05 18:59:21 Where can you get cbd oil or capsules or whatever. I suffer from anxiety wonder if this actually helps. Would be interested
2396 2018-03-05 18:59:19 why did the amazing atheist pour boiling oil on his micropenis and balls
2397 2018-03-05 18:59:02 What an idiotic tweet. I’m from the Merthyr valley and there’s nothing romantic about coal. It was dying anyway in the oil age and we have now moved on to renewables. Leftist, sentimental twaddle Mr Smith.

2403 2018-03-05 18:58:42 I really hate seeing people buy cars and not know how to keep up with routine maintenance on the car.  Keeping the car clean, oil changes, making sure your tires are good. Y’all just be driving y’all cars in the dirt for nothing. It’s more to it then just putting in gas
2404 2018-03-05 18:58:38 The writing was on the wall for that exact thing before he even signed the contract.

2407 2018-03-05 18:58:28 I love the smell of beard oil but it feels more dry after then before I applied it.. makes no sense

2409 2018-03-05 18:58:10 If the body shop wants to use Jenelle to promote then here’s an idea. Send her an oil to drip on her coochie to see if the smell goes away. There’s a true way to tell something works 
2410 2018-03-05 18:58:10 Don't be daft it's not a problem, I love that you're making it. Yes re yeast that's what I'd try, 2tbls of oil should still be OK it's likely been slightly too much for a 400g loaf but it's just what I got into the habit of using when making a bigger 600g loaf.
2411 2018-03-05 18:57:53 Today, Iraqi Parliament has approved a law that will not let KRG sell its oil anymore.
2412 2018-03-05 18:57:51 Wow, @alexiskleinman x @Mic's essential oil piece was really ignorant. I mean it was totally inclined to find quackery! Simply applying logic to her key points dissolves her argument.
2413 2018-03-05 18:57:49 Y'know. I think the point is that you told us, and many people that support you, believed that the lands were NOT going to be used for oil and gas. And instead were going to be made more open for public benefit. You lied in the views of many people.
2414 2018-03-05 18:57:47 US sanctions on Venezuelan oil industry might be the key to trigger a run up in oil price and by extension #inflation and the final push in commodities before the Rube Goldberg device known as the global economy freezes up.
2415 2018-03-05 18:57:40 Tillerson is over Exxon and putin has one of the largest oil companies around!  And they both want to use that Alaskan pipeline! Smells like collusion to me!
2416 2018-03-05 18:57:28 I like to apply my moisturizer mixed with a few drops of oil while my skin is still damp after I wash it, then a primer, & start off with a little bit of product then build it up, a beauty blender & some fix + after everything helps too. Dry skin is hard  use a liquid hi lite!

2418 2018-03-05 18:57:11 I use avocado oil as a moisturizer because my skin is so sensitive most of the time. Avocado oil (and more expensive macadamian oil) are very close to our natural pH and absorb really well.

Might be something to try if nothing else works :3

2427 2018-03-05 18:56:24 Don't we still need oil to make the electricity at times? GL
2428 2018-03-05 18:56:20 Maybe there's a way we can distribute the soot the same way we are distributing the Oil revenue?
2429 2018-03-05 18:56:18 We'll take that as a no 
2430 2018-03-05 18:55:57 All good and in Lucic's defence, I really don't think dropping 10-15 pounds is going to make much of a difference. The dude is just a huge guy and honestly, don't see it making much of a difference from a speed standpoint. Unfortunate but a likely reality.
2431 2018-03-05 18:55:52 "This extreme proposal opens over 90% of the Outer Continental Shelf to new drilling and puts our nation’s coastal communities, beaches, and marine ecosystems at risk of a catastrophic oil spill." @Change

2433 2018-03-05 18:55:46 Actually the safest option would be to heavily invest in green energy and reduce the need to transport oil at all... just sayin’
2434 2018-03-05 18:55:36 So Tina's breaks are grinding really really bad. And I was like woah that's bad you need to get those checked. And she goes "I know, it's bc I need an oil change really bad"

Step 1- Cut down on eating fatty and oil/based products.
2437 2018-03-05 18:55:11 I use xvo for mayo and don’t find it too much. I also use it and butter for sautéing, frying. For hard fry I use coconut oil/ ghee/lard/duck fat/dripping. I’m afraid ‘neutral’=chemically refined. I won’t use it after researching it for my book

2445 2018-03-05 18:53:44 Great thanks. I bought a tub of yeast so would that be 1.5 tsp? Would I increase the oil slightly too? Thanks Helen I really appreciate you taking the time to answer all my questions

2474 2018-03-05 18:51:20 Is everyone forgetting that as Exxon CEO, Tillerson “might” have had some oil in Russia he was interested in producing and exporting? If that is the case, and likely it is, is there any question why funds to combat meddling would be ignored?
2475 2018-03-05 18:51:18 Tillerson still wants the $500,000 Russian oil deal.

2482 2018-03-05 18:50:15 Tariffs on steel and aluminum will not correct any trade deficit with China. China has made deals for billions of dollars with Afghanistan to mine and sell heavy metals. Afghanistan has the most  resources than anyone else on the planet excluding oil.

2487 2018-03-05 18:49:26 I agree with POTUS. Steel and aluminum industry is vital. If we are importing more steel and aluminum than producing, we are in trouble. We cannot have foreign reliance on this. Remember the 70’s, jimmy Carter, opec, oil embargo, reliance on foreign oil.disaster !!
2488 2018-03-05 18:49:23 One of my life goals is to have reviewbrah sit for an oil painting for me. I don't think I'm up to doing realistic portraits at the moment, but maybe someday if I get in better practice

2622 2018-03-05 18:33:36 Is it safe for the economy? The number of jobs, revenue, taxes, etc. That Canada relies on are directly/indirectly related to oil.
2623 2018-03-05 18:33:35 RU serious....or speaking out from some drunk stupor of some stupid Italian wine getting olive oil massage on some seaside resort..At least in Sonia G's time politics was conducted from 10 Janpath...but it seems now Congress politics will be conducted from deep dens of Italy...

2628 2018-03-05 18:32:51 No, fuck off. BC doesn't want your damn oil.
2629 2018-03-05 18:32:50 I had 6 major tasks after moving states
-getting a job 
-switching my car insurance
-getting my car checked/oil change
-getting a new license/plate
-getting a new birth control prescription
-filing my F*cking taxes

and I'm doing the last 4 all today
2630 2018-03-05 18:32:49 Maybe it's time CANADA learned to live WITHOUT so much stuff from the USA. 

In the long run, it would be much better off if it kept its WATER, ELECTRICITY, OIL etc to itself -- re-learn to live within its own production.

OTHER countries do it -- they survive w/o the USA's junk
2631 2018-03-05 18:32:34 Guys surely the oil kills the Listeriosis mos ne?

2635 2018-03-05 18:32:06 Is it wrong for me to think that maybe the Oil are doing this to lower then 98 contract ask next year and 58 ask this year to help the cap? I feel like that would be what a sharp mgmt team would do, but I am faced with lots of historical data with this group
2636 2018-03-05 18:32:01 Nothing like coming back from a fun tour and getting harassed by a white construction worker on the bus en route to work:

“My ashtray smells better than you.”

2637 2018-03-05 18:31:58 How tf long it take to do a damn oil change ?
2638 2018-03-05 18:31:52 Are you suggesting that groups that oppose the @Kinder_Morgan pipeline are funded by US interests who want to monopolize Canada’s oil at low cost, costing Canadians billions?
2639 2018-03-05 18:31:50 Rex is still hoping to cash in on that oil deal he signed as Exxon CEO - can’t sell that oil until the sanctions go away, so guess what he’s doing...
2640 2018-03-05 18:31:48 How about them folks protesting construction of nearly every single oil pipeline? Or them folks crying about reducing fossil fuel usage? Are they too on Putin's payroll now? Good to see people care about decrease in oil production.
2641 2018-03-05 18:31:28 Hmm, I’m in Alberta. How about oil/gas instead?
2642 2018-03-05 18:31:06 They can be a lil pesky to clean but far less messy than oil fryers

2647 2018-03-05 18:30:57 I wonder if this same outrage would still exist if the economy was tanking. Oil sands inject billions of dollars into the economy each year and pay over 1 trillion dollars in taxes. What about those facts? Money doesn’t grow on trees and in Canada’s case it’s in ground.
2648 2018-03-05 18:30:56 #citiesipcc global climate conference now on in Edmonton, Alberta. Irony is that prov govt dedicated to expansion of #oilsands, including Kinder Morgan pipeline - incompatible w urban climate agenda of quickly reducing oil consumption. #StopKM

Mix 2 drops of jasmine essential oil and 2 tablespoons of either olive, almond, or vegetable oil. 

Apply to the affected area and gently massage for 3 – 4 minutes.

Leave for 20 – 30 minutes and rinse with lukewarm water.

2653 2018-03-05 18:30:19 Ppl knew prior to the election that #Tillerson was Putin's ally. The theory of #Trump being used as a puppet by both Tillerson + Putin was all over the place.  All tied to getting rid of Obama's sanctions + oil profits. Trump is a moron that was used by much smarter men.

2657 2018-03-05 18:30:01 We can track gun information, there just appears to be a lack of responsibility to do so. And you can believe what you want about climate change, there are plenty of reasons other than it to focus on using renewable energy and less in coal and oil.
2658 2018-03-05 18:29:58 Cook bacon and other food with a decent amount of oil. It puts iron in your food and you can use metal utensils on it. Might be safer than using non-stick.

2669 2018-03-05 18:29:04 Oh we will, we will likely not be signing any new deals with the US as long as Trump is in power and the cost will rise on our exports such as oil water steel and lumber, product the US really needs
2670 2018-03-05 18:29:04 Go back to the Carter Administration and the founding of the Department of Energy. He promised to get us off of foreign oil. Allowing drilling in ANWR and also the coasts will do that.  Wind/Solar don't cut it.  Eur is backing off of it

2678 2018-03-05 18:27:41 I don’t. We use a vegan marg; quite a lot of it, beat until smoothish. Maybe add some good olive oil. Oh, lots of salt & white pepper(school pepper, the ready ground stuff) too.
2679 2018-03-05 18:27:22 While MBS tries to shift their source of income away from oil, he is also crushing the expat workforce in the process by heavy taxes.

2680 2018-03-05 18:27:21 For the record, vinager and oil also expire, you may wanna check
2681 2018-03-05 18:27:12 I'd read about a lot of this and months ago concluded that the sanctions against Russia was a huge part, if not the main, reason for them backing Trump, Tillerson was obviously their choice - oil and money - what a great combination for treason.

2709 2018-03-05 18:23:58 >90% of the water is recycled at an in-situ facility and makeup water is usually brackish now due to the water regulations. Have you been to Bakersfield CA and seen how heavy oil is produced there? I have - CAN does much better IMHO.

2714 2018-03-05 18:23:43 Exactly my point. You are the one that drew my attention to the situation - you called me by name. This was a convo I wasn’t aware of/involved in. The squeaky wheel gets the oil.
2715 2018-03-05 18:23:30 I just found sesame seed oil in my cupboard that apparently expired 2 years ago.

2720 2018-03-05 18:22:45 Try putting a face oil on your eyelid, I suffer for eczema on my face to the point I could pick skin off - and i recommend oil!! It brings back moisture and it won’t be as dry as it currently is!!
2721 2018-03-05 18:22:39 Try vegetables. Different colours and food without too much fat/cooking oil. +Fruits as snacks.
2722 2018-03-05 18:22:35 That's lame. We talkin bout everything on the list or just the oil changes?
2723 2018-03-05 18:22:34 I don't know if the donuts we made at the grocery in the 70s were vegan or not (they used "giant bag of mix" and water), but they were fried in veggie oil (which back then was probably trans-fats.) If butter's an ingredient I assume it was margarine instead because it's cheaper.
2724 2018-03-05 18:21:59 Seems like a perfect thing to get through while getting the oil changed (and happy check-up on my lovely new car)

2743 2018-03-05 18:20:03 he also said on t.v at Bears Ears, that oil and mining had nothing to do with releasing those public lands.  This administration is so willing to destroy anything to will make the wealthier, wealthier

2755 2018-03-05 18:18:56 Gullible warming is all about securing energy supplies to survive the coming ice age, shut down coal oil gas will result in billions dying.  Think.
2756 2018-03-05 18:18:54 Saudi Arabia's oil production agreement with Russia was opportunistic at first, but it is now the foundation for a broader relationship that has the potential to reduce already waning U.S. influence in the Middle East.

2759 2018-03-05 18:18:37 Things to remember:
1. Body oil is great when you're in the beach.
2. Body oil is not such a good idea when you are about to hit the sheets
2760 2018-03-05 18:18:36 yoooooooooooooo this girl just EMPTIED a bottle of oil in my head
2761 2018-03-05 18:18:25 Is the oil thick Bc I h8 that feelin
2762 2018-03-05 18:18:23 Ignorance, or the need to just consume less oil.
2763 2018-03-05 18:18:19 After watching both parts I can say - I know who's pushing the buttons on this conflict and that if Iran and Saudi Arabia go to war - it will push the whole region into the stone age. Then we can go in and take all the remaining oil.
2764 2018-03-05 18:18:19 Good question? I knew when an oil CEO was nominated it had to do with making new deals, nothing to do with diplomacy. #GOPComplicit #maga

Keep out Americans! When Trump leaves maybe we can talk?
2777 2018-03-05 18:15:56 Groundnut is my go-to flavourless base oil, but not sure of the sustainability issue. Would be good to hear verdict when you've unpicked this thread!
2778 2018-03-05 18:15:42 who drinks oil?
2779 2018-03-05 18:15:40 I had a lavender essential oil mix that spilled in my car while I was driving and not long after I started getting drowsy and had to pull over to take a nap, don't underestimate the oils friends
2780 2018-03-05 18:15:35 And yet with some oil price recovery since the bottom, and investment in the US oil industry rising, the continued drop in Alberta investment in 2017/2018 is obviously about more than just pricing.
2781 2018-03-05 18:15:26 i just realized i forgot to put setting spray but its ok bc my face is ultra moisturized from my cream and oil :)
2782 2018-03-05 18:15:17 Solid entry rt there.
2783 2018-03-05 18:15:10 I thought that when I first heard the tobacco scent brought up. The essential oil doesn’t smell like that
2784 2018-03-05 18:15:07 Americans sure eat weird stuff. Nothing beats wholegrain real toast with garlic, olive oil, grated tomato, and salt!
2785 2018-03-05 18:15:05 How you suppose to change my oil in the car but don’t change the oil, or put new fluids in my fckin car

2788 2018-03-05 18:14:52 Hmm then why all the craze for reducing palm oil in soups and using tomatoes instead to give it colour?
2789 2018-03-05 18:14:29 I think we need good old Teddy Roosevelt see what he thinks about the whole thing you'll break them up just like they did Standard Oil
2790 2018-03-05 18:14:16 Oil has a little more to run, too before piling on shorts
2791 2018-03-05 18:14:00 I vote yes too
2792 2018-03-05 18:13:53 Colab at Sallys is my favorite! It goes on super nice and I find it doesn't cause excessive oil, buildup!
2793 2018-03-05 18:13:51 Saw some oil pumps & whatnot near the epicenter. Coincidence?? 
2794 2018-03-05 18:13:44 When Citizens United changed the way campaigns could be boosted by dark money, they stopped representing constituents and started representing the NRA, Koch Industries, Singer, Adelstone, oil etc. We have to take it back.

2798 2018-03-05 18:13:20 Sadly for you oil is no longer the tool to control the world with. It’s technology. Israel has it. Even the Sunni states are lining up to liaise with Israel. But all that is irrelevant. Jews are indigenous to the holy land & deserve self determination. Don’t let it kill you.
2799 2018-03-05 18:13:05 Oil&Water is amazing
2800 2018-03-05 18:13:00 You forget all those cuts came back to cost Albertans more to deal with population growth during the oil boom years.
2801 2018-03-05 18:12:56 I’ve had at least 3 migraines a week since I was 12 years old. 6 days ago I started taking @bluebirdhemp CBD oil capsules and I’ve gone 4 days without a headache or migraine. I haven’t taken a single pain pill since Thursday.  #NewPerson #ImSpeechless #ThankYou

2812 2018-03-05 18:11:16 The place known as Biafra was, in the 1960s, the fastest growing economy in the world. …the growth had nothing to do with the crude oil in its soil. Its economy was then based on cash crops, principally palm oil and other ancillary products from the palm tree…~ Emefiena Ezeani

2824 2018-03-05 18:08:57 My new favorite breakfast is toasted foccacia with goat cheese dipped in olive oil and balsamic and some type of meat.  I don't feel  pretentious saying that either.
2825 2018-03-05 18:08:57 Well condi rice and Robert gates both approved of tillerson. I can't imagine gates would be involved anything too nefarious, but condi, yea, we all know about her credibility

It could just be good old fashioned greed to put an oil man in there and not tied to Russia.
2826 2018-03-05 18:08:55 time to jack the price of oil. hard wood and electricity that we sell to the US dirt cheap

This one clearly falls in the Perversion category. When “Family Values” @GOP attempt to “normalize” child molestation, it’s interesting to see how silent the more moderate @GOP members become. By their silence, they are equally guilty and deserve no respect.
2828 2018-03-05 18:08:40 How much of a raise has gas and oil paid you?  By the way, WE ARENT GETTING PAID.  You have no clue whatsoever.  Stop putting a wedge between teachers and parents.  DO YOUR JOB SO I CAN DO MINE.
2829 2018-03-05 18:08:30 Commodity prices flat this year due to lower demand.

2831 2018-03-05 18:08:14 No problem! I have a diffuser and ill put peppermint oil in it when i start to get one! And they have a baby vapor bath you can get at walmart in the baby section and i put that in a warm bath. (Its peppermint lol)
2832 2018-03-05 18:08:11 Thanks @EcoverUK! Recycled plastic and better cap are great. It’s just that the ridges in the bottle are a bit unfortunate making it look like vinegar or vegetable oil.
2833 2018-03-05 18:08:11 Even todays light olive oil? If you’re not cooking with it then you can use any oil. Just a matter of taste?

2844 2018-03-05 18:06:37 It’s the weather, girl. Use a hydrating serum (I love Lush full of grace, or anything with hyaluronic acid), a nice hydrating Cream and a facial oil (Rose hip or marula) on top. Don’t use anything with clays in it, itll make the situation worse.
2845 2018-03-05 18:06:37 But for real though, Wash those dishes out immediately if you use any sort of oil based dressing or dishes are nightmare. #dishsoapforthewin
2846 2018-03-05 18:06:33 Sure but with all due respect, it doesn't matter. Do people jump all over musicians & actors the way they do athletes? Most certainly not & no one questions their so-called worth ethic. I just find the whole thing ridiculous & always have.
2847 2018-03-05 18:06:29 SO AN UPDATE! 2 days ago I popped my bubble and I applied tea tree oil on it in the morning/night and it went away so quickly! You can see just a little bit but it’s not visible at all.

2852 2018-03-05 18:05:55 I hope so, too! I LOVE potatoes, and am hoping I can make a somewhat healthier version of fries with this contraption! Also, crispy tofu without submerging it in oil.
2853 2018-03-05 18:05:48 I say we tax their oil and water they get from us....

2855 2018-03-05 18:05:42 I read that there isn’t any oil off the coast of Oregon or Washington, why would they drill?

2872 2018-03-05 18:03:55 Our contacts in the oil market are saying this is more a "buy the dips" market these days.
2873 2018-03-05 18:03:54 Time for Canada to put some tariffs on the flood of CHEAP oil you get from us every day.  Western Canada should add a tariff to make the oil price more fair.  $47 oil from Canada, or $65 oil from Europe?  Canada is the one with the BAD deal, NOT the USA! #whitehousemoron
2874 2018-03-05 18:03:47 it's for mayonnaise. I want a neutral oil base - 100% olive oil is too strong for many people. But also intrigued to know for frying
2875 2018-03-05 18:03:31 Fortunately, Minnesota has laws in place that prevent utilities from cutting off gas and power to homes in the winter. There are also a state assistance funds. Yes, the homeless are at risk and any one who buys heating oil directly.
2876 2018-03-05 18:03:27 If this trade mess continues should we as Canadians 1) quit travel to the US and particularly wintering in  Florida 2) quit US wines and foods 3) Stop buying American foods when we know it’s from there, 4) put a tariff on oil/gas exports!
2877 2018-03-05 18:03:18 Watched. Great show. Canada can’t do anything to restrict oil because it doesn’t have any pipelines to go anywhere other than US. For now.

2889 2018-03-05 18:01:58 Norway is better off than UK because it has invested its oil revenues in a sovereign wealth fund.  The UK funded tax cuts following the 'trickle down economics' drivel.  Everyone is happy in Norway with low inequality and high taxes.
2890 2018-03-05 18:01:57 If you are not frying or roasting at high heat, olive oil is perfect? It’s got to do with smoke point. I use avocado oil for cooking at high temperature
2891 2018-03-05 18:01:53 How does that guy still have an account?

2897 2018-03-05 18:01:21 Every time i go get my oil changed i give the mechanics this death stare until they finish... ion wanna hear "you need this you need that", no, change my oil dammit
2898 2018-03-05 18:01:14 and I was delivering coal from Shirebrook to Cottam Power Station as rail unions backed miners, it was a vile situation, rocks thrown at us, oil poured on roads, on hills.  Pickets were trying to kill people.

2901 2018-03-05 18:01:06 Bake #sweetpotatofries by cutting up into slices and seasoning w/ olive oil, #cayennepepper and a dash of salt.
2902 2018-03-05 18:01:06 I read this tweet & I'm looking your brain in it. PDP diverted oil money in the name of subsidy (you even heard about it). Did you see that APC run NNPC has been paying N24Bn a month for over three years now in the name of subsidy without public knowledge? God help your life.
2903 2018-03-05 18:01:05 That request has already flown.  And unless Russia, Iran, & Venezuela can be completely taken off line, that request will have to acquiesced to.  Once we understand that, we can understand US interest in renewed sanctions on the 3 oil exporters above...
2904 2018-03-05 18:00:54 I wish I could call upon someone to come swoop me while I wait for my cars oil to get changed, but unfortunately.. I can’t.

2907 2018-03-05 18:00:33 I agree with you aside from the being “paid well” part.  What they make is obscene.
2908 2018-03-05 18:00:26 Hi @organixbrands - is all the palm oil that you use sustainable?
2909 2018-03-05 18:00:16 I use coconut oil all the time, and I drink coconut milk everyday. I love it

2911 2018-03-05 18:00:01 Hair Tip:

Always get a hot oil treatment or a protein treatment between each sew-in installment to keep hair healthy
2912 2018-03-05 17:59:52 I, in my capacity as Scunthorpe boss, completely agree. Especially since this means that @tlotlo20_ has gone into a 2nd gameweek with a tapped player. I think the league managers should vote on an additional 4 point deduction. 

My vote is Yes.
2913 2018-03-05 17:59:50 Texas developers are a special lot. If you are not familiar with it already, have a look at the history of your new home town in the 1980s. It went form oil boom town to deep depression almost overnight.

2928 2018-03-05 17:58:11 Indirect action like increasing oil production or military spending doesn't count. We mean DIRECT ACTION... such as....those bipartisan sanctions that were passed and are waiting for you to enact.

2934 2018-03-05 17:57:46 I had this problem when I had long hair. I used (small amounts of) body powder to kinda absorb the moisture, as well as using soap that strips the oil (e.g. cheap bar soap) from time to time
2935 2018-03-05 17:57:38 @stanleyreed12 Hi Mr. Reed, 
my name is Eli Buchanan, I go to high school in Cleveland. i'm contacting you so i could get your expertise on the Sakaka project in Saudi Arabia. i read your article From oil to Solar. i have some questions if you're available. let me know. thank you
2936 2018-03-05 17:57:28 Shea butter, cocoa butter, and coconut oil are my go tos or anything with vitamin E. Also tea tree can help with ingrown hairs. 
But just a tiny bit on a qtip and kinda dab it on the irritated or infected areas.
2937 2018-03-05 17:57:21 Friends! Do you guys use CBD oil to help with anxiety?

I’m looking to try any methods at this point that will help me be able to sit in a plane to attend PAX East. I don’t need something to make me pass out. I don’t need something to get me high. 
I just want to not panic. Thx!
2938 2018-03-05 17:57:11 One author recommends flax seed oil for better sleep then compares the taste to a combination of racoon urine and asparagus. Uh, capsule, maybe?
2939 2018-03-05 17:57:09 The peel is good! Make sure you follow up with an oil slathered on or a hydrating Mask and wear sunscreen. It also looks like I have blood all over my face when i use it and that’s enjoyable.
2940 2018-03-05 17:57:00 I made this stain remover I got off YouTube to get oil out my clothes and it worked
2941 2018-03-05 17:56:48 lol niggas be using their income tax to pull a BMW off the lot but completely forget how expensive the maintenance is. Now they car burned out cause they didn’t know a oil change was gonna run them a check they didn’t have.

2963 2018-03-05 17:54:00 oh uve got to try it. its a variation of butter and it tastes heavenly. and unlike regular butter which burns easily ghee is great with heat so its as healthy as coconut oil for cooking
2964 2018-03-05 17:53:59 What color is the check engine light? Cause if it's yellow then it's just for standard maintenance like an oil change. When it's red you have to worry.
2965 2018-03-05 17:53:58 @LIBGyal ok soooo, I'm loving everything so far! My skin is purging a little bit, but I know everything will be  in a week! EVERYTHING SMELLS SO BEAUTIFULLY!My oil cleanser spilled in the mail, but it's cool. I'll buy more when you re-up.

2967 2018-03-05 17:53:16 Putin. They really were to drill oil once the Sanctions were lifted. Putin was to receive 19.5% from the billions Rex wld have made. Something to do with Roneft board...it ALWAYS goes back to Putin

2971 2018-03-05 17:52:11 Omg and by oil I meant alcohol, I need more coffee
2972 2018-03-05 17:52:08 Remember- ALL of this... every bit of it, revolves around ONE thing - A trillion dollar Siberian oil deposit that Exxon can't extract for Putin due to sanctions. And the pipes run through the Ukraine to Crimea.... its ALL about the oil/$$$ #greed
2973 2018-03-05 17:52:03 We all do. But the department has a point. There’s so many other factors than just speed. For instance, first rains always have the issue of oil/petrol on the road from dry Gauteng winters. 

You will slide if you hit your brakes to hard. That’s just logical.
2974 2018-03-05 17:51:59 Imagine if OIL was down today.

You have the right to walk slowly towards your destination, anything you say can and will be informed about the fact that justice comes at a higher price than previously imagined, the transformation from gas to oil will be done later"
2976 2018-03-05 17:51:37 Tillerson! Putin’s man in the White House no diplomats , no reforms, no Russian speaking, no diplomats, we will pay a heavy price. We are lost! The perfect storm! Criminal Enterprise. We are at war! The oil the oil! No sanctions and we are complicit. Our guards are removed!
2977 2018-03-05 17:51:34 Aquí falta la maravillosa "Lorenzo's Oil", con Susan Sarandon y Nick Nolte.
2978 2018-03-05 17:51:28 We knew that Putin chose Tillerson in 2017 and reported it. Nobody even touched the story. Putin’s former chauffeur was the recipient Mobil Oil that became Luke Oil after Putin jailed and murdered the Oligarch that bought it from ExxonMobile.

2986 2018-03-05 17:50:25 Tillerson is on Putin's side not our side.  He is a Russian agent or else why was he picked with no experience, so he can get oil from the Arctic for Russia.

2989 2018-03-05 17:50:16 He is a bureaucrat, not a businessman. I have just finished 20 years working for an international organisation (such as IEA) and they are EXTREMELY POLITICAL! He does not care about the IEA reputation, he just pleases his stakeholders (OECD countries) by talking down oil.
2990 2018-03-05 17:50:10 I believe that Tillerson was banking with SANCTIONED RUSSIAN BANKS during the EXXON years.  Or whatever his oil co. is.  How does HE get a SECURITY CLEARANCE?

3005 2018-03-05 17:48:24 A beard doesn't make you tougher. The oil you put on it to keep away the itching proves it.
3006 2018-03-05 17:48:06 @JustinTrudeau perhaps we need to hit @realDonaldTrump where it hurts. Time, for #anda to dump a massive surcharge on all oil sent to the USA in retaliation for any tariffs on steel. See how #America likes paying double for gas!!!
3007 2018-03-05 17:47:38 It’s because as yet the system is not as renewable friendly as it is oil, gas and coal friendly. It would be easy eventually to divest and invest in renewables but not yet I guess
3008 2018-03-05 17:47:38 Health benefits depend on how oil has been processed - only cold pressed pass the test so that is extra virgin olive oil and rapeseed oil that is labelled as such, not the cheap veg oil, which is also rapeseed. It is about the balance of omega fats.

3026 2018-03-05 17:45:33 Tillerson was favored by Putin, given a friendship medal. Rostneft oil wants to sell off that $500 billion in oil, and can't with sanctions in place. Undoubtedly some of that money was promised to.....fill in the blanks.
3027 2018-03-05 17:45:31 Crude oil prices are higher, with Brent back above $65 per barrel.
3028 2018-03-05 17:45:19 lol..the working - class? So how does it help the Auto industry, the Aviation industry, the oil industry, and the beverage industry, which employs lots more than the steel industry? More facts- steel workers about 150,000 and those who depend on steel about 3.6 million..

3032 2018-03-05 17:44:55 CBD Oil Supplements are fully legal, as they are extracted through ecologic methods from natural hemp plant with a low content of THC,  under the legal limit approved in the UK. Those are only residual substances that can’t ‘get you high’.

3039 2018-03-05 17:43:29 Of course. Tillerson was to be placed there because Putin was expecting the sanctions to be lifted that would allow a trillion dollars worth of oil to flow with Exxon.

3044 2018-03-05 17:43:11 The United States is dependent on Middle East oil because of our “very stupid” policies. They laugh at what fools our leaders have been. No more! I will slap a 50% tariff on oil imports to revive our struggling coal industry. #MAGA

3054 2018-03-05 17:42:01 When you're roughly worth $26-40 billion like YouTube, there's no effective competitor or entity who can level the playing field other than YouTube itself or government. It's why trust-busting legislation existed in the past to break up steel, oil, and rail monopolies.
3055 2018-03-05 17:42:00 Until the source is regulated, there is no way to ascertain purity. For example, a recent study of CBD oil sold commercially - even that which is allegedly "tested" -  found that about half of all products post inaccurate amounts of actual CBD per recommended dose.

3057 2018-03-05 17:41:34 So when the 11th votes you out we can expect an apology or concession that you obviously weren't working for ALL the people of your district. Or are you going to slink off to Fla with your oil/gas money? I'd bet the latter.

3096 2018-03-05 17:37:10 I'm not sure I've ever seen rapeseed oil labelled as such that isn't the fancy cold pressed extra virgin grassy sort - which is no good if you want a neutral flavour.  Am I not looking hard enough?

3149 2018-03-05 17:31:20 While this gets a little metaphysical, statisticians have determined that, if taking bribes from Big Oil were an Alaskan sporting event, you would take gold, silver and bronze simultaneously. That's impressive to me, anyway.

3158 2018-03-05 17:30:01 Last time I came to this dealership for an oil change I needed new tires and an alignment. Couple months later same dealership no changes to the car now I need ac repair and new wipers but I asked about my tires and they’re fine and an alignment is not needed. 
3159 2018-03-05 17:29:54 Oh yah, I remember; there's this other Jamaican castor oil, it's for hairs. I thought @MissManjo was referring to that pure castor oil that smells bad. But I heard it helps too.

3166 2018-03-05 17:29:26 Next time try a pot, coconut oil, popcorn kernels and salt. It will be better than movie popcorn, cost less and faster.
3167 2018-03-05 17:29:25 Italian cusine is so overrated. 

Motherfuckers have a dish called 'Aglio e Olio' which is is literally garlic and oil. And pasta.

3169 2018-03-05 17:29:21 Let's not forget oil prices were sky high through the Klein era as well, so he was able to buy us with our own money, so I think your hitching your wagon to the wrong horses there Mr Kenney?

3174 2018-03-05 17:28:55 Interesting how bullish he is on US production.  There is absolutely no risk-off in his call of massive production increases. It will be fascinating to see this play out, as the IEA's reputation is all in with this prediction. If wrong, result will be a HUGE reaction in oil $.

3179 2018-03-05 17:28:05 As a B.C. resident, I don’t want your toxic waste oil. Fully process it making more jobs for Canadians and then ship it. Still need to begin moving away from oil in this country. But till it’s processed you can keep your toxic sludge!
3180 2018-03-05 17:27:58 “Whole food plant based” is usually followed for health reasons as added oil, sugar or salt are often unhealthy. Eating this way has allowed me to reverse 2 major chronic illnesses that plague my family. 
3181 2018-03-05 17:27:53 Right, and v much doubt they will do that. Handing off to SOMO under a budget system that only gives salaries concedes the whole ball game: leaves IOCs, domestic oil companies, pipeline operators etc twisting in the wind.
3182 2018-03-05 17:27:51 First two things to break my fast and start my first #KetoDiet are...

I promise you will not see a big change in taste 

And 

1/4 cup macadamia nuts (best tasting of any kind) highest fat to carb ratio of any nut
3183 2018-03-05 17:27:50 Goose taste like I imagine what drinking motor oil would be like

3195 2018-03-05 17:26:13 CSX employees also throw their used oil spray cans and used coating cans on Latrobe Park property, so they don't have to deal with disposing of the waste themselves. I've probably disposed of a 100 of these cans myself. I'm also finding railroad ties.
3196 2018-03-05 17:26:10 I’ve never been this happy to leave work early. Just to go spend some money on an oil change my dad said he was gonna Pay for smh

3202 2018-03-05 17:25:14 It's that why Isis is stateless no more oil fields and it didnt take the 10 years obama said it would take Putin China didnt respect obama. Economy markets jobs wages raises 401s companies coming back. Tax cuts ms13 oil sales to other countries all this happen with no dems help.
3203 2018-03-05 17:24:59 Remember when Maxine Waters said they were going to “Socialize the Oil Industry”. 

She wasn’t kidding. It was Obama’s agenda. 

Socialism is the Left’s agenda and they will stop at nothing unless they are stopped.

It’s called TREASON.

3212 2018-03-05 17:24:29 You aren’t wrong in thinking this. But again, you gotta go where the money is. I work in automotive parts and you can’t just ignore GM as a customer because they are big. And the US also loves our wood and oil, hint hint!
3213 2018-03-05 17:24:22 Well visit Spokane, I'll give a body message with coconut oil That might relax you.
3214 2018-03-05 17:24:15 Know what, and I really hate to say this, but we have our own issues here including an orange one, fix your own crap will ya? The mistake the US made was getting involved in the mid-east for oil. I'd rather walk. Do what you have to do.

3231 2018-03-05 17:21:42 Those are longer-term solutions, not short-term ones. Warren Mosler's opinion is that the inflation ended as a result of the deregulation of natural gas several years earlier, which allowed that industry to grow substantially as a result of high oil prices. That's basically what

3245 2018-03-05 17:20:19 As you know, the IEA will point out that they are not forecasts, they are scenarios and projections. Still, if evaluated as forecasts, some IEA oil projections have been remarkably accurate, under the circumstances. We have a paper on this coming :)

3255 2018-03-05 17:19:28 How about, Russia is trying gain control of potential Arctic oil deposits, which is no longer locked by ice, and so would like to work with Exxon to pull the oil out for them? That would be an excellent end game for Putin and Russia's unstable economy.
3256 2018-03-05 17:19:22 I remember when I first moved out I got some frozen orange chicken that told me to throw the *frozen* chicken directly into oil. I think it was trying to teach me a lesson a la Arrested Development.

3290 2018-03-05 17:15:29 And once Putin is finished building his gas & oil pipelines from Russia/Qatar/Iran thru Syria & Turkey to supply Europe he will have all the leverage he needs to make any country in Europe do whatever he wants.
3291 2018-03-05 17:15:26 Too much oil
3292 2018-03-05 17:15:08 And I’m all like yes ma’am I need an appointment for oil change and I noticed she already talked differently then me but ya know most ppl do sound differently on the phone
3293 2018-03-05 17:15:05 I’m confused. The trade deficit with Canada is $18bn? The US exports far more goods to Canada than it imports but needs crude oil, hence the deficit. How does the US win a trade war with Canada? They can sell oil anywhere but the US needs Canada to buy the $282bn worth of goods.

3299 2018-03-05 17:14:32 The surplus is supported by oil rebound of 2017. Data is genuine.. 2016 was a seriously challenging period.

3303 2018-03-05 17:14:08 Ha! 1. All the wines were made in actual wineries (as opposed to in repurposed oil barrels at our garage) so there's a good chance they won't be lousy!   2. Our Fair Commonwealth, MA, doesn't let us have wine delivered either, so we feel for you there!

3307 2018-03-05 17:13:35 When they name an oil tanker after you, it means UR in pretty deep. 
3308 2018-03-05 17:13:33 It’s a one year bet either way. The positive on this is they’re prioritizing skating.
3309 2018-03-05 17:13:26 Surely it won't be oil. Or would he? Nah..
3310 2018-03-05 17:13:20 So altogether the budget amounts to a repudiation of KRG's involvement in the federal fiscal system, much more strongly than in prior years. Numbers just don't add up for the KRG, and as you say, little urgency from Baghdad to make deals to release Kirkuk oil for export.

3355 2018-03-05 17:07:32 Greeks usually use olive oil, I believe, and perhaps lemon and herbs. Of course the olive oil is actually a mix of olive and other oils...

3357 2018-03-05 17:07:24 Let's force the US to pay full price for Canadian oil, or we should start sending to countries willing to pay a fair price. Throwing this into NAFTA negotiations at this point is not a fair practise. Hopefully he's impeached before NAFTA is finalized.

500 oil tankers per year to Washington but you refuse to justify that - how interesting.  

American industry is fine with you but you're against your own country wanting some growth?

3425 2018-03-05 16:58:38 Highest rig count since 2015. Thought oil companies were cutting back drilling, generating $ internally. Nope. Must grow reserves to hide losses.

3430 2018-03-05 16:57:44 It is insane to me the lack of customer service at #HallNissanVB I have been here more than 2 hours for an oil change with no updates whatsoever. When I went out to check, the guy told me “oh it hasn’t been taken back yet” I get your busy, but can’t a girl get an update?

3435 2018-03-05 16:57:20 Ahh. Got you.
Think I’ll pop off to annoy a real foundation like @Oxfam , not that they’ve got any soiled laundry nor bed springs to oil.

3437 2018-03-05 16:57:11 Youre forgetting the fact that Trump is hiring ppl to manipulate the EPA to fit the narrative that it's okay to destroy reserved land to drill and dig up oil/coal. Plus every article youve sent me is all pro Trump.. Send me something that is a little more in the middle of truth.
3438 2018-03-05 16:56:54 Joke was on her when she could no longer afford to change the oil.

3443 2018-03-05 16:56:21 Yes .. I use Castor Oil on my face at night with few drops of Tea Tree Essential oil in it.
Castor Oil softens nd hydrate my skin while Tea Tree Essential oil works as anti bacterial and relaxes my skin muscles!
It's a great combo for combination skin!!!

3450 2018-03-05 16:54:57 How much have oil prices affected his buying power ? This is so unlike him. With the way markets are these days, we should have been up there.
3451 2018-03-05 16:54:50 Maybe we'll see Morocco threaten to switch off Europe's winter electricity because of irredentist claims on Western Sahara. Thing is, sunlight is much easier to find than oil.

3454 2018-03-05 16:54:45 The more oil that we produce in the US the better. What a difference having the right person in office makes.
3455 2018-03-05 16:54:24 No new ICE cars after 2030 - but the stock of cars will remain and deplete over time. Hence, there will be a lag between 2030 and the year of no oil use in passenger car segment.
3456 2018-03-05 16:54:23 Question: Is the fact that the U.S. buys very little steel from China a good argument against the tariffs? Global market right, just like oil? Or is steel more differentiated? This is not a question about whether tariffs are generally a good idea or whether Trump is a fascist

3564 2018-03-05 16:42:57 Tillerson was CEO when Exxon inked a half TRILLION $$ deal to develop Russia's Arctic oil fields (that was pre-sanctions). GOP in general is secretly rooting for Russian interference too, as they are all bought off. @nytimes @IgnatiusPost
3565 2018-03-05 16:42:48 This may be TMI but the climate is so dry in Denver that I had to swab conconut oil in my nostrils before going to sleep or I’d wake up with my nose on fire. Didn’t know how used to humidity I was smh

Rex Tillerson was placed on this job for one reason. It was to appease PUtin and do his bidding. This is about OIL.Rosneft, $& removing sanctions
3574 2018-03-05 16:41:48 When you take your work truck to get the oil changed and they tell you you gotta wait for an hour and a half. Dude if my company would let me change it I'd be done in less than 15 mins. Time to waste my day.

3580 2018-03-05 16:41:09 I think Canada should do our own deal with Mexico, and scrap NAFTA. Our pipeline to the west coast can deliver oil anywhere in the world. Increase our prices on hydro electricity to NY and area, or cut it off altogether. Bye!!

3702 2018-03-05 16:27:54 All of our municipal gov'ts do not support oil tankers and oil spills. These same municipal gov'ts pay for ALL police services, so highly doubtful anyone would be instructed to do this in Canada in 2018. #EnoughIsEnough #ActOnClimate #cdnpoli #bcpoli #StopKM #WaterIsLife

3724 2018-03-05 16:25:53 Were you even born before oil and gas were found in the N Sea? The Thatcher govt spread the benefits of the oil income across the whole country after 1972 so you got your share of the oil income. You're just greedy and utterly selfish in believing that UK oil was wasted on the UK

3748 2018-03-05 16:23:35 IEA's Birol at #CERAWeek18 : We see strong global oil demand growth in years to come and half of it comes from China + India. We see in China's oil numbers a slight weakening of growth, mainly driven by the saturation of the economy and new Chinese energy/pollution policies.

3974 2018-03-05 16:03:07 as workers and employers fought over who was going to pay the increased costs of production. So, there are a few possible steps. Increase domestic oil production; shift to other energy sources; centralize (or somehow govern) wage negotiations.

4007 2018-03-05 16:00:14 It depends what you think caused the inflation. It clearly was not too much aggregate demand. I'm not an expert on this episode (I wasn't born yet) but the story that sounds most compelling to me is that it started with the oil price shocks, and continued as a wage/price spiral,

4015 2018-03-05 15:59:36 If Pre. trump’s Steel tariffs were about national security, than why not build a Steel stockpile similar to the SPR for the oil industry, why start a trade war? It’s a distraction from the fact Pre. trump has not imposed sanctions on Russia!!!

4018 2018-03-05 15:59:27 US & Canadian oil markets are highly integrated.  In 2016, US imported 3.8 million bpd from Canada, and exported 0.9 million bpd.  Export tax or tariff would screw up the logistics, maybe lead to return of crude-by-rail, and cause weird regional price anomalies.

4037 2018-03-05 15:57:25 Good morning! This is a great question! You can apply these two oils to unscented lotion for topical use. For Peppermint, the recommended dilution percentage is between 2-3% with Lavender at 2-5%. You will always want to stick with the dilution of the lower oil (Peppermint 2-3%)

4118 2018-03-05 15:47:32 Maybe Canada must.....stop sending oil to the US and process it here. Canada must...stop sending free and discounted hydro to norther states..
4119 2018-03-05 15:47:25 it would be nice to talk to someone that has a personality denser than oil in water
4120 2018-03-05 15:47:22 Does it appear that Nick seems to enjoy behaving like a Two Faced Prick ?

4128 2018-03-05 15:46:11 Why do people cook with so much oil omfg 
4129 2018-03-05 15:46:10 Markets internally very choppy I am expecting a bounce for a few days possibly still think the Feb lows will be tested which would be fantastic for new entries.  Sold my oil short Friday looks like oil wants to bounce as well.
4130 2018-03-05 15:46:08 Using satellite imagery for identifying oil storage... Are this monstrous tank without lids??
4131 2018-03-05 15:46:06 あゝ無能
4132 2018-03-05 15:46:05 @Sandal_BMW Can I supply my own oil for a service with you?
4133 2018-03-05 15:46:04 
4134 2018-03-05 15:45:55 Russian Oil ties... keep looking!
4135 2018-03-05 15:45:46 Stir together 2 tablespoons cheddar with 4 1/2 tbsps eggs. Add Olive Oil. Fry. Serve on bread
4136 2018-03-05 15:45:38 Yep, and we hang on to our bibles and guns.   We're just plain deplorable.  Those kind of comments will surely make me want to vote liberal.
4137 2018-03-05 15:45:22 I’ve come across Garrett a few times as we both work in Oil & Gas out here in Calgary. Sounds like his dad and the boys went on an unbelievable west coast golf trip a couple of years back (CPC )

4139 2018-03-05 15:45:14 I need an oil change
4140 2018-03-05 15:45:02 I put some castor oil and coconut oil all in my hair last night and washed it this morning and it’s super soft today and looks a lot healthier. I gotta start doing that more often

4146 2018-03-05 15:44:28 Rail capacity can only increase by so much.  Pipelines allow for massive expansion of the tar sands.  How about reducing oil by rail and pipeline?
4147 2018-03-05 15:44:19 Looks like there's too much oil.
4148 2018-03-05 15:44:19 i just got AO MUCH FUCKING PEPPERMINT OIL IN MY EYE LEMME KMS!

4153 2018-03-05 15:43:37 I watched Alex Jones show once from curiosity. Every few minutes he’d interrupt his program to sell you his gym and brain power supplements. So he combines being a figurative and a literal snake oil salesman.

4156 2018-03-05 15:43:21 Hey, Canada should just quit supplying the US with oil, natural gas, steel, aluminium, wood, minerals, etc., etc., etc... now that would be a real wake up call!

4158 2018-03-05 15:43:15 Ehhh they only appreciated covered in oil
4159 2018-03-05 15:43:10 We need more information from places where we eat, it's important to know what type of cooking oil they use. Unsalted food with the choice to add salt if you want to. Decaf coffee options, choice of milk. Many places you know what you are getting, others you don't. Halal meat?
4160 2018-03-05 15:43:03 This weekend I had my first full weekend off in months...go to do adult things and get my oil changed yesterday...and my cell phone gets stolen. 

This is why time off is not good for me.
4161 2018-03-05 15:42:25 Most of us are like Palm oil any slight calm weather we dose off and our enemy stay up like Kerosene but our God is wonderful using them to cook beans for us till they dry up
4162 2018-03-05 15:42:23 And if you think it's good to be doom sprayed.... Or what if you think no doom should be sprayed, but rather neem oil?
4163 2018-03-05 15:42:20 However, I do agree with you that “scale” is a loaded term in that oil + other energy inputs is really a matter of price. I put that over $100 a barrel as the energy return on investment is substantially lower on all the other alternatives.

"Got an oil change, #GodsPlan"

"I’m hungry, #GodsPlan"

"I don’t wanna go to work today, #GodsPlan"

Lmao shut up.
4166 2018-03-05 15:41:47 I want to share this information to everyone. I had back pain for 30 years all the meds. The doctors give me wouldn’t work. Four days ago a good friend tells me about cbd oil  so I buy some and after four times of useing it. I am pain free. Wow
4167 2018-03-05 15:41:38 olive oil bundt cake is my second life-changing discovery of 2018 (the first was the dang towel turban).
4168 2018-03-05 15:41:31 if your bro uses up all of your beard oil, is he really your bro??
4169 2018-03-05 15:41:27 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
4170 2018-03-05 15:41:27 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

4172 2018-03-05 15:41:21 Okay, has anyone out there ever tasted fried polony? I don't think this Leicester City what what thing can survive hot oil. #FryThatPolony
4173 2018-03-05 15:41:05 @marcemery @jodieemery  We had  oil delivery truck suddenly go into reverse and smash into our vehicle pushing us like a bull dozer 200 feet backwards in a straight line. Cops are called. He arrives and says we were speeding and skidded the 200 ft and crashed into truck. cops LIE
4174 2018-03-05 15:41:01 The melt off just gets every last drop off. It’s this wand that spreads oil on your lashes. I’ve also become addicted to all things Tarte now that I wear a full face every day.
4175 2018-03-05 15:40:59 Never put hot oil under water  literally
4176 2018-03-05 15:40:56 Thanks for reaching out. All vehicles require oil changes to keep the vehicle performing optimally. Your daughter can check her Owner's Manual for more information on the scheduled maintenance for her Jeep. ^RR
4177 2018-03-05 15:40:46 I love coconut oil
4178 2018-03-05 15:40:40 Nigeria is a racists country. We are oil producing country but we don't have fuel
4179 2018-03-05 15:40:40 Hey smart guy, for more context study the wikipedia of usa regime change, and input the factors of our embargo of venezuela, the 2002 coup attempt backed by us there, and our propensity to invade or embargo countries trying to exit the petrodollar and sell their own oil.
4180 2018-03-05 15:40:34 あの時のBBの言葉はスッゲー嬉しかったなー…
4181 2018-03-05 15:40:33 I made a new toner yesterday out of apple cider vinegar, tea tree oil, lavender oil, euclayptus and rose micellar water and noticed changes over night. whew
4182 2018-03-05 15:40:32 UGH the cod liver oil...that’s like, a traumatic childhood experience. I think my generation was one of the last to take it religiously, too

Ok!  Thank you market! I'll take them!
4189 2018-03-05 15:39:54 축하해!!
4190 2018-03-05 15:39:40 If your talking about WWII, than it was more of the cutting off their oil supply leaving Japan with only 18 months of stock. Japan had steel manufacturing capabilities, and very little oil production.
4191 2018-03-05 15:39:39 These are amazing, Dominic!  What are your thoughts on Gannon's refactor? Is he like a slick Oil Barron, or local Bar Owner?  Trying to place his backstory :) 

But yeah, awesome work!!!
4192 2018-03-05 15:39:37 Leaving my car to get an oil change so like someone scoop and I’ll spark lol
4193 2018-03-05 15:39:28 ALL tipsters and research writers only promote a stock when they have already bought. No matter they may say otherwise. They people you mention are just another Pumper or placing facilitator. #aimiscorrupt

4196 2018-03-05 15:39:23 The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) says it is set to immediately resume oil exploration activities in Nasarawa State.
4197 2018-03-05 15:39:21 Look who's talking we are biggest club in world and we are bcz of our tradition not like some oil money
4198 2018-03-05 15:39:10 Mind. Blown.
4199 2018-03-05 15:39:09 Well doh. It was obvious from the beginning that Tillerson was selected for his oil connections and experience in the Ukraine.
4200 2018-03-05 15:38:57 I am studying to be a petroleum geologist/geophysicist. I volunteer for the NRA ILA. @DLoesch
4201 2018-03-05 15:38:47 How hard would it be to build invincible nuclear missiles if the price of oil was $35 per barrel or lower? #Russia's entire economy is based on it, devaluing it as has been done by other administrations seems like it would be an effective hedge against communism. #Oil is dead.
4202 2018-03-05 15:38:46 Uhmahgod this new oil smells so good

I feel like I procrastinate but I just have no respect for any piece bec I leave it for my newest idea or current inspiration
4205 2018-03-05 15:38:29 "This is my 1st time coming here for oil change, Tires Rotate Tires and Brake Inspection..  They have good deal..." @Groupon #HappyCustomer
4206 2018-03-05 15:38:26 Trump should worry about his own dirt and idiocy instead of worrying about people who are not in the WH! It's like comparing water to oil or a drip to a waterfall!!
4207 2018-03-05 15:38:19 girl wtf  i don’t even do that why you wash it that much? but just make sure you condition it good, moisturize it & use whatever oil you use so it wont be dry. i got mine dyed last year mine never broke off i grew alot i know that

4213 2018-03-05 15:37:57 I believe it. Russia wants oil sanctions gone and Rex Tillerson IS oil.

4218 2018-03-05 15:37:33 It was always about lifting sanctions so Russia and Trump’s pals could drill for oil.
4219 2018-03-05 15:37:25 Aaaaa yes.  I loved his Oil and Candle, but haven't kept up with him.  Bless for landing this on my radar.

4221 2018-03-05 15:37:07 That is pure BS. BC wants to block W pipeline while importing gasoline from US. Oil is shipped via rail (Warren Buffett), which causes the current glut and damages farming industry as well. Canada suffers, US benefits.
4222 2018-03-05 15:36:55 I’m suppose to get up and go get my oil changed but I’m depressed today I don’t feel like leaving the bed
4223 2018-03-05 15:36:53 gusto ko ng siomai na maraming chili oil na may bawang tas toyomansi. p*ta cravings.
4224 2018-03-05 15:36:41 @HomefuelsDirect when is my oil delivery happening. A man phoned me and said he would get back to me but still waiting. We have no oil left. This is urgent.
4225 2018-03-05 15:36:36 The evidence has been out there for decades. I was reading old articles and studies 10 years ago on the health costs of shift working in the oil industry.
4226 2018-03-05 15:36:33 The people of Syria want him   You want to kill him because he won't give the elites his oil
4227 2018-03-05 15:36:32 He said this was a fact lol, you have to be weary of people like this 
4228 2018-03-05 15:36:31 OIL, WATCH closely, dipping now as 15min chart completes 1st wave up this morning, dip 2nd wave underway, as VOLATILITY is ON now. 2nd wave higher pending of 5 waves up today.
4229 2018-03-05 15:36:11 The Authoritarianism is getting a tremendous foothold. @realDonaldTrump is throwing the baby out with the bath water while he dismantles all the blocks for for the entitled class. #IlDouche lives. #русскийученик All Hail President Tillerson - Helping push oil to $65 p/barrel.
4230 2018-03-05 15:36:09 I’ve used maracuja oil for YEARS. It’s worth it.
4231 2018-03-05 15:36:08 Finding myself saying “there’s an oil for that” a lot lately.
4232 2018-03-05 15:36:04 Pulse: NNPC to resume oil exploration in Nasarawa State – Official

...hopefully someone is doing it for free.
4233 2018-03-05 15:35:59 I recommend you watch the Documentary Who killed the electric car. It's very enlightening in exposing the pressure of incumbents (Big Oil and Carmakers) to kill EVs. This time around China's push is too important to kill it for a second time.
4234 2018-03-05 15:35:56 Please don't promote Dana. She loves this. Go after George Noory-Coast to Coast. He needs exposure. We already know how vile this woman is. George promotes Alex & Corsi along with lots of snake oil products night after night for decades, yet escapes scrutiny. He's a big problem.
4235 2018-03-05 15:35:51 Ugh, thank you! Im definitely gonna try the oil... I appreciate it!!
4236 2018-03-05 15:35:23 Because of my hatred for our overdependency on oil it's the Kogi state situation that pains me the most.
4237 2018-03-05 15:35:21 taena ng ate ko hindi pa rin umuuwi hanggang ngayon, ung pinabili kong oil pastel anuna :---------)
4238 2018-03-05 15:35:21 We have oil fields of our own. At least we knew what oil was, the middle east had something that if we hadn't told them what it was they still wouldn't know and would still be poor.
4239 2018-03-05 15:35:13 The U.S is after Venezuela's oil.

4246 2018-03-05 15:34:40 Wow China's partner Mr Putin probably won't be  happy with that. So what is the benefit for China to turn that around? Are they loosening their grip on the physical to prepare for the oil for Yuan gold option?
4247 2018-03-05 15:34:34 This would be good for Alberta oil companies, but terrible for Canadian wallets. Can’t blame her for putting Canadian’s interests ahead of US based oil companies operating in Alberta can you?
4248 2018-03-05 15:34:33 On the list of things I wish I could have told my younger self:

Fiber supplements are your friend and are amazing.

Take magnesium supplements for muscle pain.

Fish oil capsules are great, You don't need to prove you're tough by doing cod liver oil shots.
4249 2018-03-05 15:34:22 Where da fries with garlic and olive oil at?
4250 2018-03-05 15:34:17 How about we use American steel - instead of RUSSIAN STEEL- in those massive gas and oil pipelines you want running across the country?
4251 2018-03-05 15:34:15 Funny our Can $ is valued 30% less than the US$...US companies purchase our resources on the cheap. US $ is tied to Oil. I do agree with make America great again..and the work you have thus far...
4252 2018-03-05 15:34:13 Probably just an expectation that it won’t remain down for long. I don’t see much direction for oil for a few more weeks, likely rangebound until we fully exit refinery maintenance season.
4253 2018-03-05 15:34:05 "Unforseen circumstances" is carny for "truckload of oil money".
4254 2018-03-05 15:33:56 @LeBatardShow this is amazing. Stu leaves and yall strike oil with Bill. This is incredible.

4267 2018-03-05 15:33:02 Wat in onze wereld minstens zo belangrijk is: de daling van de kosten voor VS schaliegas. Nu nog hooguit 2,5 - 3 dollar per MMBTU (15 dollar per boe / barrel of oil equivalent)
Schalieolie blijft een VS verhaal. Schaliegas kan wereldwijd van de grond komen (behalve in Europa dan)

4269 2018-03-05 15:32:49 We've been dumping steel, oil, lumber, grain, and hydroelectric power for dirt cheap on the States far too long now. That moron Trump just made it easy. Cut him off completely.

4402 2018-03-05 15:16:30 Remember that he had spent the prior 5 years working on Exxon’s oil deal with Russia. I knew right away why he was installed as SoS.
4403 2018-03-05 15:16:12 Stop using coconut oil on your face if you get acne easily! It will clog your pores and cause blackheads because it’s comedogenic!!
4404 2018-03-05 15:16:10 That's exactly how I look at it. Doesn't solve the underlying issues but appeases the masses thirsty for blood.
4405 2018-03-05 15:16:07 That was an initial thought.  Checked oil as well as bearings and everything looked normal.
4406 2018-03-05 15:16:07 Yeah, raising the price of steel 25% sure would have helped you!
This is going to cost 10s thousands of jobs in metal work, oil, automotive industries.
The unemployment and stock market disasters will assure #BlueWave2018 
4407 2018-03-05 15:15:47 Develop Economic Attack plan to deprive Russian of foreign currency.  More oil to Baltic nations, Poland and Ukraine.  Economic Development plans for same nations to deprive Russian of local economic activity.
4408 2018-03-05 15:15:45 @FoxNews car prices would sky rocket& price for gun steel will also rise. You'll have to be ric hg to own gun. Oil & steel Trump commodities?

4416 2018-03-05 15:14:49 Rex Tillerson shows us that just like in Russia big oil companies here too are run by former intel chiefs that will go on to run the state.  Not sure why the FBI lets the CIA boys run the show.  Perhaps if FBI wasn’t so divided they could do their job.

4428 2018-03-05 15:13:19 yeah there’s no way around it. You could rack up on castor oil before you get lashes and apply it every night. I use it to get thicker, and longer lashes.

4432 2018-03-05 15:13:02 #MYN to be producing oil from oil sands at sub $30 is ground breaking.   Proof of concept now evidenced.
4433 2018-03-05 15:13:02 @whyyradiotimes Did the CIA let the Taliban & Osama escape from Bora Bora because it believed we would someday return to negotiating oil deals with them (like in Dallas pre9-11)?
4434 2018-03-05 15:13:01 i need ah good face clenser & some good oil or something
4435 2018-03-05 15:12:52 Yep the oil
4436 2018-03-05 15:12:47 Tillerson, is there for Putin's oil, no other reason.  That huge deal he made with him and then sanctions.  Simple I saw it right away.
4437 2018-03-05 15:12:36 This would be the perfect trio to keep the masses happy who are pro Chiarelli. Gives them two sacrificial lambs to blame & the 3rd is a little something for putting up w/ this season.
4438 2018-03-05 15:12:23 Rex = oil = friend of Russia - bottom line:  lifting sanctions!
4439 2018-03-05 15:12:20 Another day of watching Supreme Court opinions to see if Oil States will come out. Going to be at least another two weeks.
4440 2018-03-05 15:12:18 I’m sitting in the lobby waiting on my car to get the oil changed and I swear, every tv in this place has got politics on them. 
4441 2018-03-05 15:12:13 There won’t be anything left of the EPA when this administration is finished with it. Koch brothers, oil and gas robber barons, others superrich, specially real estate developers don’t want EPA to interfere with them making profits. Screw the environmental and Human damage.
4442 2018-03-05 15:12:07 Coconut oil only, Thankyou very much.
4443 2018-03-05 15:12:06 I'm looking forward to the day when the Bitcoin moguls replace the old oil money on the Forbes list.
4444 2018-03-05 15:12:04 He only leaves out that America is reliant on high grade steel imports for among others bridges and oil pipelines. He’s sabotaging the domestic economy.

4447 2018-03-05 15:11:54 I saw + heard from citizens some of that same phenomenon when I visited Angola back towards the start of its oil boom. Remaining colonized by Portugal until very recently and having a series of governments that replicated the behavior of its colonizers has really hurt the people.

4450 2018-03-05 15:11:38 a name like Mable and all of that grease on those greens, you've got to have some Southern roots.  Only BP can create a bigger oil slick than found on Southern greens.
4451 2018-03-05 15:11:37 With oil prices climbing, there will be  a negative result for Republicans in 2018. Gas prices are climbing. May not make sense but: $10/week gas increase > $50/week in tax savings to a voter in November. @POTUS #MAGA

4546 2018-03-05 15:02:08 Rex and #gop wants to start drilling for oil with the Russians. This was the money grab plan. Remember #45 cyber security with Russia idea? #traitorinchief #FBI #maga #complicitgop #TrumpColluded
4547 2018-03-05 15:02:07 I can’t even remember my last oil change... but for some reason I’d rather go get a pedicure.

4554 2018-03-05 15:01:02 Don't forget that swim bit though. For example much of the sole and plaice in the n sea undertake the juvenile part of the life cycle off the Dutch coastline - before migrating more widely. Whose natural resource is that?? Oil, gas, etc are a bit more territorially fixed

4572 2018-03-05 14:58:27 Been that way forever. If the folks need to silence someone they throw them out the window. Or down the plane they're on. GW Bush and others have done things. Of course the grand fiasco (to me was)9/11 followed by Iraq. Iraq had signed oil contracts with the wrong oil companies.

4608 2018-03-05 14:53:45 So, to be clear, your peanut butters all contain palm oil, but it's not listed as such because it's an ingredient to E471? And you list E471 in your ingredients.

4660 2018-03-05 14:47:32 It started almost 10 years ago near #kyaukphyu where the Chinese gas/oil pipeline ends. PRC is building an SEZ + naval base there. Rohingyas were scapegoated to deflect attention from the ubiquitous Chinese in Burma and to make “room” for them #Lebensraum

4662 2018-03-05 14:47:13 I've noticed CBD oil seems even more popular than usual lately, maybe since Holland & Barrett started selling their oil for half price.
I suppose it's because it is cheaper, that means more people willing to try it.

Igor Sechin and Gennady Timchenko, who now work personally for Putin and Jinping, will keep the crude oil price up hoping for the eventual appearance of greater fools.

4848 2018-03-05 14:23:12 HAHAHAHAHAHAGA!!!!!!! “What is an oil change???? Do I really need that or are they trying to scam me”
4849 2018-03-05 14:23:08 This has been obvious since day one, it is nice to see Steele confirmed it!  Tillerson was groomed as long, if not longer than Trump and signed an oil exploration deal at Exxon worth over $500B to tap massive oil reserves that would then be exported via Red Sea port, Crimea!
4850 2018-03-05 14:23:08 Do Russian/American interests in oil exploration in the polar regions figure into this?
4851 2018-03-05 14:23:05 Economics, Ed. It has to do with jobs. Go read the American in the Oil Field out of word, idiot! Two words, “proper balance”.
4852 2018-03-05 14:23:00 Since 2000, US steel production fell 20% while Russian production is up 15%. In that timeframe the US has created countless jobs in technology and healthcare and has advanced oil production to the point where OPEC is ineffective.  Russia, not so much.  Quit it with this bullshit.
4853 2018-03-05 14:23:00 Ok. That’s it. As an  in  I say it’s time for  to shake some stereotypes & damn well respond. Hard. Without apologies. This should be the limit; draw the line. Talk about contempt for friends and being taken for granted. Oil & gas? Hit trump.

5003 2018-03-05 14:13:12 Hi there - if you want to take along a small amount of used engine oil there's no charge for that. Hope that helps.
5004 2018-03-05 14:13:12 Lemme guess; the single donor is 'an oil man?
5005 2018-03-05 14:13:06 I don't know what "advanced position in the imperial world order" means either. Having a shit-ton of oil probably has more to do with their wealth than this abstraction.
5006 2018-03-05 14:12:58 Mmm what you didn't understand in policy of Europe within Britain & USA right or left that they won't interfere in active way like they do I Iraq 2003 our under UN in Lybia unless they have a benefit like Oil

5049 2018-03-05 14:08:28 They hurt the oil industry and make the small part imports, US uses to make exports, more . So our exports will be less competitive and that will mean the deficit goes up.  Also, how does it change our negative savings-rate? Oh, it doesn't?  Thks for playing Know-Nothing

5057 2018-03-05 14:07:31 Of course they weren't. But they did not occur out of the blue. There was a clear reason for them. From the oil crisis causing a secondary banking crisis in the 70s to the sale of "innovative" unsustainable banking products pre-2008.

5073 2018-03-05 14:05:07 Huge oil reserve beneath their feet......
5074 2018-03-05 14:05:02 Venezuela is the result of an economic collapse due to price of a dependent export, which in their case was oil. I'll make it simple, a shoe shop sells children's shoes, £20.00, you think I will buy those tomorrow, but by then the price jumped to £40.00, shoe shop making bucks.
5075 2018-03-05 14:05:00 As a business owner, I agree...but when push comes to shove...he’s trying to punish China, and rightfully so, not Canada. The US needs CA steel. It’s a fact. It needs the water, the electricity, the oil. I have no problem with renegotiating, but this trade is pretty equal.
5076 2018-03-05 14:04:57 Tillerson would likely be Putin's guy since Russia is so dependent on oil and Tillerson is an oil guy.

5093 2018-03-05 14:02:42 Yeah. Fair conclusion.  Disturbing.  May be a sign of greater differentiation of missions.  But I worry because of funding the regional universities are struggling if they bear the teaching mission. #okleg needs to think more about the pipeline for our state and not the oil one.

5130 2018-03-05 13:59:20 For me Geoff, when Dein was forced out things started to crumble. 

I always felt AW & DD were a partnership and the rest of the board had no clue. 

It just left AW to shoulder it all. 

With the advent of oil money taking over the English game, it was too much for him.

5135 2018-03-05 13:58:38 That is very kind of you to say. And now it’s my turn: Thank you to YOU and to everyone else in the oil & gas industries ... you folks not only heat our homes & get us around, your industry also makes a HUGE contribution to the prosperity of our country. So Thank YOU!
5136 2018-03-05 13:58:35 No we increased our domestic oil production like any other sane country would have.  

We're not replacing steel either.

5143 2018-03-05 13:57:15 *i also read current and back issues of @ least 3peer-reviewed ELT journals regularly, w/ONLY one purpose: to oil&feed the internal mechanisms of the ‘me’ instrument that “teachearches” as a F/T job. What’s the label for this? And in how many ways will we ignore Ts knowledge?
5144 2018-03-05 13:57:09 And the price of drilling for oil will go up with the price of steel. Russia says “Thank you.”
5145 2018-03-05 13:57:03 Venezuela is quite tragic actually, its main export which is oil, dramatically fell in price, oddly something similar happened here, only in reverse. In 1973 Oil prices spiked, that caused a recession, inflation increased and the Dollar was devalued. cont. -

5161 2018-03-05 13:55:26 Maybe because you, your family, & your campaign staff were breaking the law? And you’re right; this is bigger than Watergate, when we have a president actually conspiring with a hostile foreign power to take over the country. You’re a liar and a fraud, a snake oil salesman.
5162 2018-03-05 13:55:19 Now this is logic. You do have a point here... I'm not disagreeing with your statement but I have a follow-up: bacteria can die in excess heat so when the meat is fried in the oil, shouldn't they die off from the heat? 
Unless listeriosis can live in excess heat
5163 2018-03-05 13:55:18 Does anyone remember one of the first things the new republican Congress did when it came back into session in Jan 2016 was to pass the bill that ended disclosure requirements of payments to oil & gas companies ? AKA bribes 
5164 2018-03-05 13:55:06 the fact that Loving Vincent (2017) has won NOTHING is a crime against humanity. every single one of the 65,000 frames were HAND PAINTED. 65 THOUSAND individual oil paintings. it's a literal masterpiece that has slipped by unacknowledged and i will neither forgive nor forget this

5196 2018-03-05 13:51:15 What the fsck is Grandpa prattling about? Only 3% of the trade deficit can be attributed to Canada and that's because it imports so much oil and gas. The US has 5% of the world's population and uses 24% of its energy resources. You want to reduce the trade deficit? Promote solar

5392 2018-03-05 13:29:20 I accidentally just got peppermint oil in my eye! If you're tired it will wake you up right away. I don't recommend it though.
5393 2018-03-05 13:29:11 "The State Department" It's so obvious  Rex Tillerson former CEO of Exxon was hired by trump to head the State Department. He had contacts with Russia. Tillerson gutted the State Dept. We don't have a single ambassador to any country now. T Rex intended on gutting American oil $$
5394 2018-03-05 13:29:06 Snake oil salesmen
5395 2018-03-05 13:29:01 And when Tillerson was CEO of Exxon Mobile, he and Putin had a lucrative deal. Oil in Russia obtained with Our technology. Have you wondered why DJT is dissing clean energy and promoting coal and oil.
5396 2018-03-05 13:28:53 So what did the USA do after realizing they are depending on other countries oil? Did they invent cars that don‘t need oil based fuel? Did the push forward a way to use energy from regenerative sources? No, they traded their soldiers blood for oil.

5402 2018-03-05 13:28:22 Norway has good education because their STATE spends enough money educating their citizens...Money they get from returns from their STATE run oil company and high TAXES. All things which you free market nuts argue against because you’re actually AGAINST development of our people.

In the end, who the Hell cares...!?

Russia limits US-backed SDF
Turkey gets a chunk of Syria and helps jihadist allies
US keep oil fields to have leverage over Assad and helps older jihadi allies, limiting Iran influence

5454 2018-03-05 13:21:10 The most important part of a skincare routine is consistency. Always take every bit of your makeup off before bed, chemically exfoliate, moisturize daily (if you’re oily your skin is probably dry and overproducing oil to compensate). Let me fix your skincare problems!
5455 2018-03-05 13:21:09 Wasn’t it obvious from the start that the idea was for POTUS Trump to lift the sanctions and Tillerson to develop the $500 billion sanctioned oil fields that Exxon had? Why was there any other reason to appoint Tillerson Secretary of State?

Oil changed every 12 months or 15k. Fuel prices are expensive. Breaks will need changed within a few years. Etc

5558 2018-03-05 13:08:53 It’s seriously stunning how ignorant you are. Hes making our country independent again. Oil, coal, steel, etc.. do you have ANY clue how many jobs this will create, not just in the steel industry, but downstream as well? You libs despise self reliance for both people and country!
5559 2018-03-05 13:08:49 Fun Fact:  If the price of steel increases in the U.S., it will cost America more money to drill for their own oil.  Who does this benefit?  

RUSSIA!
5560 2018-03-05 13:08:49 As a Canadian, just thought I'd mention that 45% of your oil supply comes from us at a discount. Sounds like it's time to change that discount. If Canadian steel is a threat to your national security, then you're going to find out the hard way that out oil can be tarriffed too.

5563 2018-03-05 13:08:35 This Monday looks like a Monday. US stock futures are down about 0.22% with Asia and Europe mixed.  Oil is $61.23 with gold at $1,325. It will be better with some sunshine.
5564 2018-03-05 13:08:32 'Scotland' does not buy or sell oil. Oil companies do that, and if they make a profit, after expenses, it is taxed. Tax revenue is ALL that comes to the state. Today, it is practically non-existent. Do keep up.

When your non renewable natural resources start plummeting b/c "America First" you can just "take" oil, right?
5577 2018-03-05 13:07:22 I agree with this. This time, ask them to justify the union. They have shit on the eggs, with the vow, brexit, oil, you name it. Turn it round. Tell us why we should stay in UK.

5579 2018-03-05 13:07:09 How tf does that benefit Russia. It’s still cheaper to drill for our own oil than buy it from Russia. Trumps just trying to get people who used foreign steel to switch and buy American.

5596 2018-03-05 13:04:14 We learned in the 1970's what happens when you are at the mercy of foreign oil.

For some reason, people today think the US being almost completely dependent on foreign steel from places such as China is a GOOD thing. 

They are wrong.

5696 2018-03-05 12:48:48 I'm not sure if UK offers smth w/ that degree of strategic importance, almost impossible to replace w/ huge degree of dependency. Hence no sanctions directly on oil or gas in RU. But even small EU sanctions hit Russia's prospect of eco development away oil dependency badly. 2/2

5738 2018-03-05 12:42:17 but in the scenario, the viable premise would have been that there’s no substitute source of revenue generation except through oil , considering the percentage it adds to our GDP which has ultimately led to the borrowing (which i still find unnecessary)

Isn’t that why Putie put him in that position? He coincidentally resigned as CEO of Exxon to joined Team Dotard?
5779 2018-03-05 12:35:41 This reporting is pathetic.  Most of the demand is in diesel and distillates.  Under the path you’ve outlined a glut will form in condensate and deficit in conventional crude.  Means low prices for shale oil and no growth.

5828 2018-03-05 12:28:03 Tea tree oil isn’t safe for cats or dogs...also she’s so dumb, it says right on the bottle skin blemishes 
5829 2018-03-05 12:28:03 You know the old saying ,death and taxes. You can’t avoid neither. I find it humorous you use snake oil salesman and Nancy in the same sentence. I get the feeling anything Trump does you will resist, so perhaps we should end it there.

5957 2018-03-05 12:07:05 Amazing , worlds largest oil reserves . It’s virtually impossible to make an arse of the economy
5958 2018-03-05 12:06:40 I have looked at the @ActforWildlife site and they do not list you as having sustainable palm oil. Until you are on there (or use an alternative to palm oil) I will have to avoid Cheddars and other @JacobsSnacks stuff with it in.

5960 2018-03-05 12:06:33 I agree with the comments,
Eat local!
Eating Sattu will serve you better in long run than the oats for example.
Reduce sugar, replace with unrefined Jaggery.
If you have high cholesterol or heart disease, any vegetable oil e.g. sunflower work well, No need of olive oil!

6020 2018-03-05 11:58:00 @KeejaysLTD Hi, been enjoying your sauces for a while , but must confess I never looked too closely at ingredients list before but I just have and I now have a question - is the Palm Oil you use CSPO certified?  Thanks!
6021 2018-03-05 11:57:44 Today i had half a mind to change my oil, so i did. Honestly I did a half assed job but I don,t feel bad since i only started out with half a mind to do it in the first place.
6022 2018-03-05 11:57:28 Great while they cozy up to Russia and Putin buying oil and gas supporting financially the genocide of 500,000 in Syria. #Germany seems to always revert back to fascism.
6023 2018-03-05 11:57:15 I ran out of olive oil so had to use..... sunflower oil instead! #BadTeenAcademy #OffTheRails #thismorning
6024 2018-03-05 11:56:21 Unless the new US shale oil discoveries have, miraculously, a much lower API than current (to compete with OPEC/Urals etc.), unlikely for that to happen. Asia/Europe oil demand is predominantly for middle distillates, the one area where light US shale oil is at a disadvantage...
6025 2018-03-05 11:56:16 I know what you mean. Felt the same. I was way overdue for my oil change and finally got it done.
6026 2018-03-05 11:56:01 I’m just a bartender from Guelph but even I know the only reason the US has a trade deficit with us Canadians is the amount of oil you buy from us. Take oil out and you have a massive surplus. #knowingishalfthebattle

6032 2018-03-05 11:55:36 Are you sure it is coconut. It is very costly now. Most of them use palm oil, unless it is cooked at home. Tapioca chips is even better. Now it is the season of Jackfruit chips!
6033 2018-03-05 11:54:52 Im not keto per se but I'm protein and high fat diet. Morning breakfast is turkey bacon cooked in butter with eggs cooked in olive oil with cheese.

6106 2018-03-05 11:44:25 All of it. Corp Tax, VAT, CGT, Oil, and the power to have our own legislation on it. You know, like a couple of hundred other countries. 
6107 2018-03-05 11:44:21 When Phyrexia sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're sending Negators, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing oil. They're bringing phyresis. They're compleationists. And some, I assume, are Sleeper Agents.
6108 2018-03-05 11:44:11 Yes they bombed an industrial city that was engaged in making products for the military.

Personally I would have tried an open sea bomb first.

6113 2018-03-05 11:43:34 @morning_joe saying Trump hasn’t had a real crisis yet. Remember when the pirates and the BP oil spill were considered crises for PBO & folks squawked at how he handed them.

6134 2018-03-05 11:40:24 RT OurIndiaFirst19: China’s dominance in the South China Sea depends on its presence in the Indian Ocean. For a simple reason.

6310 2018-03-05 11:02:02 I guess you need to believe that. We are in the UK. your population voted for that. If oil was found off the south east coast of England would you expect the SE (population 8 million) to seek independence & keep all the revenue within the area or for it to benefit the entire uk?

6342 2018-03-05 10:55:51 So I looked to find out how long fossil fuels would last and found articles on "peak oil". I found them really interesting because that seemed to give a concrete limit to possible warming. So I tried to add a link to the global warming article - within seconds it was deleted.
6343 2018-03-05 10:55:18 Thanks 4 the 12/2016 NYT reminder.

6379 2018-03-05 10:46:25 Chef Kawasaki cut up some Pikmin, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a dictionary, along with toast.
6380 2018-03-05 10:46:11 -2 I sent you. Trump hasn’t been easy on the Russians, in fact, he’s been pretty tough on them and their allies.He also didn’t remove the sanctions which O had put on them. Furthermore, by our increasing our oil and natural gas production we’re seriously hurting their economy

6384 2018-03-05 10:45:54 I call it Rhine capitalism not socialism. To be truly socialist in my opinion means taking over the means for production Venezuela the oil richest country in the world tried it. It failed.
6385 2018-03-05 10:45:49 DB is a plausible man to an extent but like all snake oil salesmen gets found out eventually. To me shows why elite sport funding should not be solely based around medals, ethical sport should also be a priority.
6386 2018-03-05 10:45:34 I don't understand why there isn't a global campaign for clear 'No Palm Oil' logo (like the fairtrade logo - could be an Orangutan) on products so consumers do not have to wade through the countless names for it in an ingredients list. @LeoDiCaprio @Greenpeace @WWF @UNEPinEurope

6391 2018-03-05 10:43:59 We remember when they were in power and oil price was $20 and they paid off the debt buhari,ibb,and abacha borrowed as military head of state.also oil price was 100 dollar we bought fuel at 87 common sense didn’t tell u the subsidy paid for u to enjoy that price was from d $100
6392 2018-03-05 10:43:32 Worked for the oil majors for decades.

6401 2018-03-05 10:42:31 Fugg it's 10 degrees out and I could totally take my bike to go places but it really needs the oil changed and there might still be salt
6402 2018-03-05 10:42:10 Right. It's a huge problem - and only going to get bigger. I was recently in Cape Town which may become the 1st major city on the world to run dry.  Yet fracking continues worldwide, oil spills and of course, climate change.

6408 2018-03-05 10:41:03 Last time I looked oil was more than double 2 years ago. Curious it costs Venezuela more than any other country to pump it. Can’t be socialism of course.
6409 2018-03-05 10:40:56 > Rapeseed oil has a high proportion of unsaturated fat and is thereby good for cardiovascular health. Our organic oat drink does not contain any oil, just water and a hint of sea salt. All the best, Oatly
6410 2018-03-05 10:40:44 The reason we use rapeseed oil in some of our oat drinks, is that we want to offer a drink with a balanced, good composition of protein, fat and carbohydrates.>>

6427 2018-03-05 10:37:14 The US HAS to have a trade deficit so that foreigners can have the USD they need to use on international markets for oil, wheat etc. Trump trying to eradicate a deficit and move to surplus is basically him saying he doesn't want the USD to be the pre-eminent reserve currency.

6466 2018-03-05 10:29:42 Part of the answer depends on how much diluent Canada and Venezuela can use. Putting sanctions on Venezuela probably not a good idea in this case. Moving forward with Keystone XL probably a good idea.

Next question: Is there enough $ an investment appetite for oil sands?

No, Chavez would not be any better, all the internal factors of the demise (as opposed to external like the oil price that was higher under Chavez) were already there.
Venezuela's problem is that a socialism-based economy DOES NOT WORK.

6692 2018-03-05 09:35:27 Ah yes, so important for little brown girls to have access to fantasies of blowing up people for oil. For too long we’ve only rewarded white girls & boys with this special dream. Totally the point of intersectional feminism to celebrate more women of color going to war.
6693 2018-03-05 09:35:23 Trump doesn’t fear the backlash bc he expects to win without doing anything but pushing pro Russian policy for a mutual gain, it’s not what u see him do it’s what he’s already done so far. Every ME/SAUDI/ISRAEL/G20 trip were deals 4 both parties with OIL on center stage.

6798 2018-03-05 09:12:16 Until now, no Canadian novel has substantially addressed the Alberta  oil sands, yet the sands define so much of Canada’s physical,  environmental, economic and political landscapes. American literature  confronts slavery; German literature reckons with the Holocaust; ...

6800 2018-03-05 09:11:32 You do seem to be under the illusion that it's less easy for Big Oil to buy the Hillarybillies of the institutional @TheDemocrats than it is the @GOP - which is an erroneous assumption...
6801 2018-03-05 09:11:17 Our Sands is set in and around the least sustainable project on the planet—the Alberta oil sands in Canada. In this relevant, funny and, yes, romantic novel, Alberta’s oil sands are also home to increasingly militant ‘ecoteurs’ who feel that one big dose of poison ...

Russia does it because their economy is heavily dependent on high oil prices. 
Russia and the Saudis fund astro turf for the same reason.

6805 2018-03-05 09:10:48 Forget Venezuela and a reversion to global trade wars. I'm just worried about the oil market's ability to weather another #CERAWeek

No easy way through this, you've been sold snake oil - it happens, but please don't compound it by defending that choice.
6818 2018-03-05 09:07:33 Mainly. And also because there’s loads of other things that seem unnecessary. So pure oil blends is probably a better option.. we already put on makeup w loads of nonsense ingredients, don’t need more maybe

Lesson learnt - order *before* the bad weather you idiot!!!
<turns heating down further>
6846 2018-03-05 09:00:43 It’s not from fracking per se. It is related to oil/gas industry tho. Contaminated water used for the drilling process is injected deep underground to prevent human/animal contact. This is the cause of these quakes in Oklahoma. They need a different plan of action.

6853 2018-03-05 08:59:31 In a true free market scenario, anyone with sufficient market share can manipulate scarcity. Take diamonds & oil for e.g. 

I agree limiting supply in this way may have had an impact. But that didn't suddenly happen in 1999.

CGT discount did though, making neg gearing viable.

6870 2018-03-05 08:55:08 I'm not APC fan boy tho, but Just a simple question!!, Is crude oil market in the 16 years the same in the last 3 years? There was boom then... I rest my case.
6871 2018-03-05 08:55:08 lol borrowing is certainly not BAD, but when you borrow for recurrent expenditure, and in this age of dwindling crude oil prices and low naira, mind you pdp borrowed less when the economy was still better oh, the current dispensation have nothing

6879 2018-03-05 08:53:08 Calling it the market of laws makes it seem as If I'm somehow bound by it. The decision of others to sell olive oil for $50 doesn't at all mean I'm bound to either buy it for $50 (I can pay more) or sell mine for $50 (I can hold on to it if nobody wants it).

7196 2018-03-05 07:43:35 Are you using toner? With oily skin it’s important to do ALL skin care regimen steps. Cleanse/exfoliate, tone, moisturize. A toner will help with all that oil production throughout the day. You need mattifying products

She chuckled. 

"Oil changes and cleaning. You think they'll go through a teenage phase?"
7211 2018-03-05 07:38:54 Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world. Greater than Saudi Arabia.

It should be a wealthy prosperous country but #Socialist ruined it

7213 2018-03-05 07:38:30 Good Morning. Are there any #heatingoil companies that would like to quote for a Shropshire based oil buying group? Currently have 4 quote but would be good to have a few more.
7214 2018-03-05 07:37:52 Need some oil lathered all UP in my scalp.
7215 2018-03-05 07:37:41 On my timeline I see people talking about paying bills or getting their check taken by their Parent from their part time job...I guess I was lucky in high school. I only paid for gas/oil changes...didn't even have to pay car insurance until my 2nd total loss ($50 teen supplement)
7216 2018-03-05 07:37:38 Oil breaking below $60 would cause this.  And hedge funds are also over 90% net long oil futures and 90% long gold. It's all the same trade-short dollar.  Any move the other way and it will be alarming, I agree.

7223 2018-03-05 07:37:19 Neurosciences are not the answer to Consciousness & Awareness of self & others, that many seem to think they are.

They very fact that Psychiatry, which is Snake oil, sold by Snake oil salesmen, barely gets questioned, is proof enough that the West falls for pseudoscience.

7226 2018-03-05 07:37:02 Just don’t use latex. You’ll have to use a special spray to keep it shiny but if it gets on the floor, then you’ll slip and fall. Also, make sure that you use oil on your skin so you can slip in easier.
7227 2018-03-05 07:37:01 I really dig honesty and conviction. So I actually think I'd like National more if they just openly said 'yeah, we don't give a shit about the planet' rather than saying 'we need to respect the environment' and then totally opening up the Maui's habitat for deep sea oil explor.
7228 2018-03-05 07:36:29 WAIT maybe they used Olive Oil!
7229 2018-03-05 07:36:23 I don't understand these two.

7230 2018-03-05 07:36:22 The amount of oil my face generates on a daily basis should be used as a resource by this country.

7233 2018-03-05 07:35:21 For what it's worth naming him Sudan is confusing. I remember a news story about a white rhino being born many years ago… Why did people stop caring about the environment? Sometimes I think the oil industry found a way to encourage the issue of racism to blow up+take its place.
7234 2018-03-05 07:35:04 Prefer to play these oil plays once fully funded.  Looking forward to see how #MATD goes today.

7239 2018-03-05 07:34:02 Her hands were strong and well-abled. Her massaging would draw blood to the affected muscles to heal them quicker. Once she was satisfied with that area, she applied another couple drops of her oil to her hands and just massage it into his back as a whole. She wanted him relaxed.
7240 2018-03-05 07:33:46 Is it palm oil countries, or global palm oil companies? I'm so sorry that finish food companies have started to use palm oil and that our matkets are selling food where is palm oil. Palm oil is big problem and it's also farmers problem
7241 2018-03-05 07:33:40 My elementary field trips included going to a mozzarella farm to see how they make hand made mozzarella and an olive farm to see how they make olive oil. Idk what’s cooler

7261 2018-03-05 07:29:05 There goes Fox again. Ignoring facts, selling conspiracy theories along with ignoring that the "dossier" was originally funded by Republican donor & the Free Beacon. How very unsurprising as they continue to feed snake oil to #Cult45.

7279 2018-03-05 07:24:14 Indeed. Australia has held interests in Timor’s oil for over a century. First oil concessions granted in 1902.

7285 2018-03-05 07:22:43 All of my friends who have used it absolutely hate it, including me. It clogs your pores and is waaay to heavy. Jojoba oil is the best for moisture and evening out skin tone! Castor oil is the best for hair growth.

Coal is being displaced efficiency, by gas & NL hydro, maybe some tidal & run of river hydro here & there, but mostly by eliminating resistance heat w/geothermal pumps, split heaters & wood in modern burners.

7627 2018-03-05 06:13:58 Ok there is some truth in that

7630 2018-03-05 06:13:32 One of my gfs gave me some weed oil bath salts that have rose and mint and ginger in them. They smell amazing and I feel relaxed and luxurious but picking all these rose petals out of my pubic hair is gonna be a bitch later

7634 2018-03-05 06:12:18 There is something so relaxing about a nighttime beauty routine before bed. Brushing teeth, cleansing oil, serum, eye cream, occasional face mask, tea tree oil for problem spots. Self-care really does count for a lot.
7635 2018-03-05 06:12:18 Lol... Some people will now think they've discovered new oil. Uncle 44.67 is actually a round up of 44.666666666666666666 to infinity. But you won't know cos you were plucking mango in throughout your primary school

7786 2018-03-05 05:38:39 Do you get that thing where it’s misty out or barely drizzling & your scalp gets super greasy? Like oil rising up on a road when it’s barely raining?

7788 2018-03-05 05:38:12 Rosehip oil has been the best investment.
7789 2018-03-05 05:37:44 Come on people! Tillerson is a friend to Putin. They had an oil deal worth millions. Trump owes Putin, probably in millions, not to mention the pee pee tape. No counter attack, no cyber defense. And no help from Republicans. Any questions?

7792 2018-03-05 05:37:20 That's a GREAT start but what i do is try to weed out the ones which i think will be tough to trade. For example, Retailers, Gold, silver or Oil companies are crappy to trade. I stick with MOmentum stocks so stocks like CSCO, ZBRA, NKTR will be good ones to focus on

7797 2018-03-05 05:36:39 This 2013 RBC report predates and confirms Scotia's analysis "The price of Canadian oil exports is low relative to international benchmarks because of infrastructure limitations that prevent oil from getting to market. " #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli
7798 2018-03-05 05:36:39 The current band of villains are the absolute worst. Big Oil has not made any significant changes to how they clean up oil spills since they destroyed the Gulf. They buy off Congress to keep paying their executives boatloads of money while raping the planet. Wake up please!

7803 2018-03-05 05:35:22 I go by what Trump's been telling the world since the 1980s. There are many of us - especially fellow New Yorkers -- that always knew he'd be @POTUS one day. That elevator ride came late, but better late than never.

7905 2018-03-05 05:13:15 Our trade volumes are supposed to economically justify both the national airline and SGR but currently can't back stop only the SGR. Same story with Oil, volumes available can't justify both refinery and pipeline.

7918 2018-03-05 05:11:51 But seriously David Wolfe and all those ilk can fuck off. That includes Dr. Oz, Jenny McCarthy, Gwen Paltrow, etc. I feel no pity if all the companies you’ve created bankrupt. You should never receive a dime for snake oil
7919 2018-03-05 05:11:49 Oil spots can be removed from clothing with Talcum Powder.
7920 2018-03-05 05:11:44 These African “billionaires” love bragging about their wealth (oil dealings and resource selling), but won’t provide any incentives/programs to uplift and foster the talents/efforts of their own people. They can keep their ashy opinions.
7921 2018-03-05 05:11:39 I’m an artist. I paint oil paintings.
7922 2018-03-05 05:11:35 Who is she ??? Look those racks!!!!!!!!!!!
7923 2018-03-05 05:11:30 Kale...ewwww! I’ve heard it said to put some oil in your pan and it slides down the garbage disposal quickly!

7925 2018-03-05 05:10:53 I can't use Caltex oil ,the oil ruined my engine there are fake caltex oils in the market
7926 2018-03-05 05:10:48 With their money you think they would want to leave a lasting legacy as pioneers in clean energy.
However, they pay politicians to get tax cuts 4 rich-(Paul Ryan 1/2M) & favorable oil/gas laws.
They support GOP who support cuts to ACA, Medicaid, Medicare & Soc Security.
A$$holes!

7932 2018-03-05 05:09:48 I'm so dumb I applied to much treatment oil to my hair and now it's way too oily fuuuccckkkkk 
7933 2018-03-05 05:09:45 CORRECTION: After the teachers' rightful demands, we realize that 7% is not enough. Teachers deserve a $10,000 raise at minimum, and the oil barons have bankrupted Oklahoma for far too long. We negotiate from a 10% GPT. #10for10 #oklaed #okleg #teacherstrike @TeacherOklahoma
7934 2018-03-05 05:09:39 how many oil and gas companies are provincially funded in some way with working people's taxes? would 90% be a safe guess?
7935 2018-03-05 05:09:07 He has a right to defend his country from obama funded isis mercenaries trying to overthrow his regime for the oil that Putin has access to, creep
7936 2018-03-05 05:09:06 Please tell me you will be doing a print of this coloured like an old oil painting or something in a cathedral.... this is breathtaking
7937 2018-03-05 05:08:56 Income from our oil industry is a significant contributor to Canada. Our eco-terrorist friends that seek to destroy Canada’s economy sure don’t mind sacrificing each of us to earn that foreign pay check. Canada”s well-being needs to determined by us not them.

7939 2018-03-05 05:08:03 Then get one of these and put it somewhere central not near a window which can steal the heat. They are cheaper than baseboard and quick to turn off or down when you go out. The oil circulating in it maintains its heat for quite a while after you turn it down.
7940 2018-03-05 05:08:02 Going back to basics but I'm constantly surprised by the number of people who do not know, or understand, what is written on a bottle of oil, and therefore have no idea what they are buying/using.

7941 2018-03-05 05:07:57 This girl for real massaged my back for like ever with coconut oil for a long ass time as soon as I woke up the other morning. Soooo needed
7942 2018-03-05 05:07:43 I believe that was part of the reason he got the job. The only one of the bunch with experience akin to diplomacy, negotiating oil and gas contracts with Russia and others.
7943 2018-03-05 05:07:32 Hehe slay Queens can't cook ...it is better than this other ndebele from Zim chick who thinks in order to cook anything you need cooking oil (fish oil) after two days I was enough with her
7944 2018-03-05 05:07:24 Make my hair dump,
I use a coconut oil, then twist them medium to small size, twist them again on themselves Na leave it for the night.

7947 2018-03-05 05:07:11 Don't understand why it's so difficult for people to understand that players who are on teams that are out of the playoffs aren't fully engaged at this time of yr. Happens everywhere & every sport. On most nights, they play hard from start to finish but the focus isn't the same.
7948 2018-03-05 05:06:56 I understand you make fear based buys.
What if I told you I had a new line of supplements.. I'm calling it "ALPHA SNAKE," and these oil capsules not only QUADRUPLE in value over a 4 month period, they actually make it impossible for ANYONE to take your guns. DM me if interested.

7952 2018-03-05 05:06:17 All that propoganda tries to make Syria look like a huge oil country like Saudi Arabia, but even before the war, all of he fields captured by İSİS was producing something like 40-50 thousand barrels a day. To give an idea, Kirkuk fields lost by Kurds produces about 600-700k day
7953 2018-03-05 05:06:11 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
7954 2018-03-05 05:06:09 What do you use carrot oil for?
7955 2018-03-05 05:05:56 What State Department? You mean the Exon Mobile guy? His biggest attribute and best qualification for the Secretary of State job is he called trump a “Moron.” The only diplomacy Tillerson uses in Russia is for the Antarctic Ocean Oil Leases and that’s perfect for this Plutocracy
7956 2018-03-05 05:05:47 Omg the person beside me smells like shedrenched herself with axe oil I get that it helps you and I respect that but my head

7961 2018-03-05 05:04:59 You forget to say that our friends helped enormously. These include Germany, where your family comes from, and the United Kingdom. We have created our enemies ourselves. And all because of the oil. What you have in mind is a betrayal of us and our fatherland.

7967 2018-03-05 05:03:56 You put tea tree oil on every day or nah
7968 2018-03-05 05:03:52 Isn’t it that oil Florence Henderson used to pitch?
7969 2018-03-05 05:03:34 How about working with energy companies so LA Oil & Gas can get back to work and generate revenue for the state. Texas & Oklahoma love their O&G industry and work with them when commodity prices are low. LA steps on their head while they’re drowning.

7978 2018-03-05 05:02:40 Soda & cheese are my "vices", I mainly use turmeric capsules for pain relief & it seems I need about 12.5mg of benadryl once every 3-14 days..for food & other allergies. So I'm definitely not the " over medicating" side of things. I use a combo of pine&Fur oil 4my asthma attacks.
7979 2018-03-05 05:02:33 My analysis of the McDonald's Szechuan Sauce is that its combination of chili and sesame oil does a good job of mimicking 辣油, but it is otherwise too sweet for a Sichuan-style dish. #SzechuanSauce
7980 2018-03-05 05:02:13 No you are NOT listening.  We want gun control, safe water, no oil drilling, renewable resources, limit on vacay Trump spending , truth, accountability, funded education and healthcare. YOU ARE IGNORING US GREED OVER PEOLE PARTY!

7997 2018-03-05 04:59:46 Venezuela — with its proud heritage, geography, natural beauty, and oil reserves — should be as prosperous as Kuwait.  But the thuggish, evil socialism of Chavez and in just 16 years has brought the Venezuelan people to this.
7998 2018-03-05 04:59:31 You're a professional snake oil saleswoman.
7999 2018-03-05 04:59:31 The price of populist policies, what did they expect from a former bus driver. To imagine that this country made America shiver when they collected their gold reserves and they have the world's largest oil reserves. That country should be better than Dubai by far.
8000 2018-03-05 04:59:29 It's only me. Making tea. Must oil the door hinges.

8004 2018-03-05 04:58:45 But they are the ones with Oil they are the ones with real wealth. 

We chastised Russia for election meddling when just one country can bring another to its knees because it can. 

Remember Saudi Arabia and the Kingdom of Bahrain have far worse human rights abuses US Govt
8005 2018-03-05 04:58:26 We tried to get power by sacking the oil refinery but that feral kid kept whipping boomerangs at us
8006 2018-03-05 04:58:01 Has everyone been asleep? Tillerson has been Putin's buddy for years. He has an award. He has oil deals. Etc, etc, etc. When will we all wake?

8011 2018-03-05 04:56:35 Yes I remember the photos. Cylindrical Oil tankers loading at the İSİS oil fields and rectangular container trucks crossing Turkish border, trying to link them together. Putin was trying to take revenge of the plane that got shot down by a propoganda campaign.

8029 2018-03-05 04:52:45 Anything cooked in coconut oil tastes amazing.
8030 2018-03-05 04:52:33 The smell was bad (I put peppermint essential oil in my WW) but the finish is literally FLAWLESS. My face NEVER looks as good as that one makes it look. Like idk if its smells bad I can remedy that and look like I drink 64oz od water and only eat fresh fruits from wakanda IDC!!
8031 2018-03-05 04:52:26 tumeric & lemon juice are your best options for home remedy. please do not use coconut oil or cocoa butter on your face. that will clog your pores. always remember to tone THEN moisturize. do not double tone. especially if you have a dryer skin type.
8032 2018-03-05 04:52:15 Respect
8033 2018-03-05 04:52:12 And by oil I mean ,, makeup remover that is oil based perhaps

8036 2018-03-05 04:51:43 Shishito peppers is a little harder, on stove with salt and oil (noticing a trend?) medium-lowish heat until they get softer. If gross and wet and floppy, try less oil next time.
8037 2018-03-05 04:51:37 Err... you realise the UK has oil just like Norway. (Well it's Scotland's but sadly were not independent yet). The difference is management. Norway manages it's oil. In comparison the UK squanders it without real benefit to the people.

8040 2018-03-05 04:50:50 I grill it in the oven to avoid oil from frying. Before I used to boil it too but haven’t done that in some time

8043 2018-03-05 04:50:11 “For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb,
and her mouth is smoother than oil: But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword.” (Prov 5:3-4) To be victorious over sin, we must look past the moment of temptation and consider “the end.”

8050 2018-03-05 04:48:02 is there a combo better than almond oil and neutrogena makeup wipes?! the answer is NO! 
8051 2018-03-05 04:47:52 Just remember; Obama was weak with Putin/Russia – Weakened our ability to use America’s/ NA’s energy resources (Keystone, Dakota pipelines, coal, oil exploration, drilling, etc).  This allowed Russia to become stronger by leveraging their energy resources for political gain.

8054 2018-03-05 04:47:25 Lord I thank you that you've never spared me the rod. I thank you that like the Good Shepard you are, you've wounded me when I've gone astray so that I may learn to stay nearer to you. You've broken me with your rod, but you have healed me with your oil! Thank you Jesus! 
8055 2018-03-05 04:47:25 Big oil has ensured that we don't have options... I have a car, but try to ride/walk/transit as much as possible. One day soon I'm hopeful at least transportation has non-oil options. within 10 years maybe?

8059 2018-03-05 04:46:55 Yes...it all started with the fall in crude oil prices. It's a repeat of Zimbabwean economy where currency is sold like veggies. Current state of economy is largely because of corruption than anything else.
8060 2018-03-05 04:46:39 Oh, and the steel tariff will really be interesting. America makes virtually zero steel pipe that meets standards for the transport of either oil or natural gas.  End of the shale & fracking boom. Brilliant move @GOP!

8105 2018-03-05 04:37:22 You think we didn't have good doctors already? We didn't need doctors. But it was cheaper to the government because they paid with oil to Cuba. It was an exchange. Stand up from your chair, find a job in Venezuela and then we talk and pray you don't get sick while there

8124 2018-03-05 04:33:44 I mean, over 50% of Venezuelas GDP is from petroleum exports and the oil industry has been nationalised since 1973, so I think its a bit misleading to say two thirds of the venezuelan economy is privatised. Its not entirely socialist but id say its more socialist than capitalist

8189 2018-03-05 04:22:00 I really do love the way Sunday Riley’s U.F.O. oil smells... it’s so relaxing!  #SundayRiley #ufooil #nighttimeroutine

8191 2018-03-05 04:21:37 What fascinates me about that area -- from Erie south to Conneaut Lake & over to Titusville & Oil City is that most of it had peaked economically, if not population-wise,  by the 1920's and the last century has been one of retreat. But in the technology age it can be reversed.
8192 2018-03-05 04:21:25 at least mines natural not made out off oil
8193 2018-03-05 04:21:17 オリーブ油で毎日を楽しく(*^_^*)
8194 2018-03-05 04:21:07 I just asked Corey if olive oil comes from oil and his reply: “umm no? Does butter come from butts?”
8195 2018-03-05 04:20:56 I switch between putting coconut oil and almond oil on my face. Tonight coconut oil won.
8196 2018-03-05 04:20:42 So I'm on the grams innit & saw a story on a person I follow & I literally just witnessed them swallow a spoonful of coconut oil like it's yogurt. I'm officially signing off for bit cuz mans done grossed me out I could not stomach it. IDGAF bout the health benefits it's mad.

8199 2018-03-05 04:20:12 Can you imagine his numbers if he had a top 5 finisher on his wing?

Assists would be through the roof and more room due to threat on wing results in more goals for 97.

When he has 40+ goal winger, he’ll score 40+ too with 80-100 assists.

Oil “must” find that missing piece.
8200 2018-03-05 04:20:09 Damn called that nigga motor oil

8204 2018-03-05 04:19:46 With that being said: I do need to figure out products that work for my hair. I need to reduce frizz, get curl definition and moisturize. 

No coconut oil does not work for me before anyone says anything  my hair just doesn’t like it
8205 2018-03-05 04:19:41 Fuckn w/ oil over both of y’all bodies >>>>>

8207 2018-03-05 04:19:08 So I forgot to pick up vitamin e oil. So I’m going into Walmart at 2116 on a Sunday night with the biggest scowl on my face and just heard a little girl go “Mama she looked angry.”

Ur fuckin’ right kid. #ooc
8208 2018-03-05 04:18:58 We're like water and oil yet we still somehow fit together. 1,142.4km are not a limit for our friendship H-BDay Pet luv ya @ruthtweedyx

8210 2018-03-05 04:18:55 Stop buying government 'medical marijuana', by now you ought to know that they only sell it if it doesn't work. Use full spectrum cannabinoid oil(s). Not government garbage.
8211 2018-03-05 04:18:41 the best feeling is exfoliating your face and then applying rose water and face oil
8212 2018-03-05 04:18:13 We might be oil and water, this could be a big mistake. We might burn like gasoline and fire, it's a chance we'll have to take.

8214 2018-03-05 04:17:24 I used Vaseline and it didn’t really do much, so I’m trying coconut oil now since i heard it helps 
8215 2018-03-05 04:17:12 This is really absurd...a citizenry held hostage by a constitution that was written by them, for them? We are dying but it can't be helped...maybe when a few more hundred kids die their blood might help oil the gears of change...
8216 2018-03-05 04:17:07 Honestly maybe. I called my mom to be like, hey, wtf do I do? And she said to soak it in coconut oil for a few days. So we’ll see
8217 2018-03-05 04:17:02 T said this oil wasn’t gonna be that much but it’s $80.... you know I’m still gonna buy it for Wilbur though
8218 2018-03-05 04:17:01 When oil runs out and the power grids fail.  Then gold will rule once again.  But for now,  Crypto's rule.
8219 2018-03-05 04:16:49 12/10 recommend a hot bath with some drops of lavender oil in it. So relaxing
8220 2018-03-05 04:16:07 Canada will shut you down, as the US can not supply what is required to maintain your economy. If it gets bad, we will shut if oil, gas, lumber, electricity and on and on. Who will supply these products for the US.

8225 2018-03-05 04:15:02 The smell of truffle oil turns me on
8226 2018-03-05 04:15:00 I’m almost 19 and I’m still afraid of the dark...luckily my oil diffuser also functions as a night light

8233 2018-03-05 04:13:11 my concentrate oil pen tastes like blueberries and 100% indica and makes me feel like a cloud ah I love California
8234 2018-03-05 04:13:07 Yes exactly! Like why haven’t you started exercising? I’m just like do you get how hard it is to even roll out of bed‽ i haven’t tried the oil cause it’s so expensive!
8235 2018-03-05 04:13:00 That must be when soft. Do you drill for oil when it's hard?

8237 2018-03-05 04:12:28 Yeah, I gotta agree. That statement alone...he lost any shred of credibility to have a decent conversation with. I definitely have some snake oil to sell him too. Just goes to prove how a lifetime criminal con-man has pulled the wool over people’s eyes. I’m embarrassed for them.

8242 2018-03-05 04:11:19 Sounds like big oil shenanigans.
8243 2018-03-05 04:11:18 Really important, cool ingredients:
- Olive oil
- Onions
- Garlic
- Paprika
- More paprika
- This is ~~special quality~~-grade paprika, right? (No.)
- Even more paprkia
- Derek, you fucking put half a cup of paprika into the stew, oh my god.
(It still tasted stunning in the end.)

8246 2018-03-05 04:11:02 On the M25 anti-clockwise within J10 just 1 lane (of 3) is now closed due to an earlier fire. The fire is out but lanes remain closed to deal with oil spillage and recovery of the vehicle. No delays but please pass with care.

8250 2018-03-05 04:09:20 Turkey is addicted to dope of cheap oil, flowing in from areas controlled by erstwhile ISIS. It would like to keep pot burning in Syria/Iraq to maintain it's  perennial supply of cheap oil. So much for Muslim Ummah!. But lest it forgets, dope is bad for long term well being.
8251 2018-03-05 04:09:00 So I synced my oil change appointment to my calendar and it automatically put it in as 3 hours long??? Excuse me???? Are we grinding up the dinosaurs ourselves???
8252 2018-03-05 04:08:48 Yeah I know, it seems strange that we are importing oil & exporting it at the same time, but thats because of transportation logistics. Also, I believe that most of the Canadian refineries aren’t equipped to process the heavy bitumen type of oil from Alberta...
8253 2018-03-05 04:08:26 Japan's navy to buy tanker to fuel ships patrolling East China Sea: sources: TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's navy wants to buy its first oil…
8254 2018-03-05 04:08:26 Is it right that are altering our only atmosphere and putting the future of our children at risk?  Of all the words I expect to hear from an oil apologist, "right" should be near the bottom.
8255 2018-03-05 04:07:53 Also oil.
8256 2018-03-05 04:07:32 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
8257 2018-03-05 04:07:31 Jamaican black Castor oil & meditation in a hot bath. A serious mood.
8258 2018-03-05 04:07:11 Holy shit he bonus is on the next pay check OTL I will finally have money to pay for my oil change/tags/license renewal and to pay tuition 
8259 2018-03-05 04:07:09 use coconut oil girl it works wonders
8260 2018-03-05 04:06:56 Will disagree there.  Most trade is still in US $ and Oil is US$  traded.  Think China has a few other priorities which is about the belt way leading to the financial systems.  There will be a push on soft power through loans to countries but lets see what US and India do.

8267 2018-03-05 04:04:21 All understandable with how this year has gone. Players read their pressclipings, realized they weren't that good and were unable to recover.
8268 2018-03-05 04:04:15 It was actually my dad who got me to do it. So you can sue him it’s actually not terrible. I feel A LOT better. They key is “bullet coffee” basically it’s coffee with heavy whipping cream and coconut oil. It’s tastes better than you’d think.
8269 2018-03-05 04:04:13 Yup, my little bottle of #jojoba oil is at work with me today. I'm paying for yesterday's midday snorkeling adventure.

8270 2018-03-05 04:03:58 I suffer with em too! Put a warm towel on your forehead. It may relieve some pressure!! And if you have peppermint essential oil that helps too!!!

8272 2018-03-05 04:03:37 You’re right we can only self sustain our own state without outside help for as long as we wanted... we have abundant land and oil, we are the fastest growing state and are not dependent.... should I keep going?
8273 2018-03-05 04:03:30 I watched the number one line come out for their first shift last night and they seemed either disinterested or actually tring to go down a goal early whilst the coach stands there in disbelief.  This scene repeats nightly.  #nobrossiotafterall I don't call that playing hard.

8276 2018-03-05 04:02:42 Facts can not be disputed.  There is no place for gobbletygook in our society.  Alex Jones peddles fraud news on the masses to shock and make money.  He is a snake oil salesman of the worst kind.  A man with no morality.
8277 2018-03-05 04:02:16 Lots of things happened before the indictment.  Like you taking sides with Big Oil going thru your backyard when odds are that it'll screw the environment and natural aquifers in the long term.  Corporate shill.

8294 2018-03-05 04:00:01 Mojo sauce, a garlic, Spanish paprika, red pepper, cumin seed, olive oil, wine vinegar, salt and bread miga to thicken it
8295 2018-03-05 03:59:27 Issues. Also the issues you raise say nothing about what the house and Senate have done because they have all been bought by the oil and gas companies. Please stop sounding like a twelve year old andeducate yourself before speaking on things that don't seem to concern you.
8296 2018-03-05 03:59:05 It's the Oil Paint filter :)

8300 2018-03-05 03:58:16 How so? There are no public or behind the scenes gripes that have leaked from any player about the coach. The play hard most nights but are inconsistent as hell. For me, that's a team who has zero confidence & no belief in itself to get the job done.
8301 2018-03-05 03:58:11 Actually, she ran out of oil for her sex machinery.

8304 2018-03-05 03:57:18 What was the Name of the Major scandal during the Harding Administration?  It was centered around National Oil Reserves?
8305 2018-03-05 03:57:14 Yeah it’s death to y’all lol! How many cups of oil did y’all have ?
8306 2018-03-05 03:57:04 @Jalen__w can bless oil
8307 2018-03-05 03:57:03 At least one gun for every legal law abiding household that would want the right for self protection. It is a duty and responsibility to own a firearm of any sort which no one should take lightly. Irresponsibility and firearms do not mix just as oil and water repel each other.

8317 2018-03-05 03:54:50 Bad! We are in default! A reach country with big reserve of oil
8318 2018-03-05 03:54:42 
8319 2018-03-05 03:54:33 And in this team's situation, it has all the optics of a coach that has already lost his team.  Not sure why.
8320 2018-03-05 03:54:22 Good luck with the oil tycoons. Oil prices have doubled in last year. More wells coming into production. Waste water increases.
8321 2018-03-05 03:54:21 เช่นกันนนนนนน
8322 2018-03-05 03:54:18 Any oil that’s been blessed
8323 2018-03-05 03:54:11 Russians don't have to do anything to see Canada fail on Oil based economy; we have our own Ruso-Canadians at helm of the affairs in Ottawa !??
8324 2018-03-05 03:53:47 How will you make America great, even you loose your money in wars, I advise you keep your self away from wars so that you restore economy also, try to trade with oil rich countries like Iran, Iraq, without any hypocritical activity,wipe away sanctions of Iran, NK,...you will win
8325 2018-03-05 03:53:44 ก็เลยหมดตัวแบบนี้ค่ะ....
8326 2018-03-05 03:53:43 bark is also waterproof and makes the best campfire wood in the rain because of that and the oil in it(that causes the aroma). #cedar #firesinthereain

8332 2018-03-05 03:52:54 I’d do the hot oil treatments too until her scalp can rehydrate. My mom used to do them on us twice a month ! What shampoo and conditioner are you using ?! That makes a HUGE difference too

8373 2018-03-05 03:45:53 Lest not forget that he was recommended by Condoleeza Rice. A Russian and National security expert - she supposedly knows better. Any senior executive from the oil and gas industry is more devoted to corporate not state interest. That’s just the way it is!

Got my oil changed
Watched Camp Rock
Took a nap
Took a shower
Cleaned my room

8379 2018-03-05 03:45:17 Ideals our politicians follow are petty parody of greed for money & power. Nothing much, nothing less. Evident they are feeding on ignorance of uneducated & poor.

Are Trump and Rs actively working with Russia to steal our votes? No consequences for them? Tillerson scoring Russian oil? Republicans... still on Team Trump?

8388 2018-03-05 03:43:46 What's up, it's Olive Oil. Somebody's been pondering if after all these minutes you'd like to turn nouns into verbs.
8389 2018-03-05 03:43:38 Just imagine when Trump puts a Tariff on Canadian oil. Oh what. He gets it’s at Half price and sells it at a Profit. Well that’s SUCKS FOR . No wonder  lobbyists are trying to kill our oil going anywhere but to them. @keithbaldrey
8390 2018-03-05 03:43:34 Started last fall actually, but I've got a degree in studio art and did a lot of oil painting back in the day so I had a bit of a foundation to start from already. Still a lot to learn with this though!

8398 2018-03-05 03:42:53 To be honest, the dependency is the other way around. Once whitey is gone, oil won't be as valuable, at least on the Western hemisphere. Same goes for the banks.

8426 2018-03-05 03:39:42 CBD oil is an extremely powerful anti-anxiety. Even though it comes from the cannabis plant it doesn't have any psychoactive qualities so it just helps your brain and body feel relaxed and centered

8485 2018-03-05 03:30:13 Let’s just say when it comes to oil, I favor greed and hoarding. Personal opinion, but I figure when it all finally winds down and falls apart, the country that’s able to supply its war machines with fuel, wins.

8508 2018-03-05 03:26:23 Story says drop in oil revenues has caused economic crisis. If that's true, why aren't Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf states in the same pile of shit as Venezuela?

8547 2018-03-05 03:20:23 If you purchase the Briogio and still have issues with dry scalp try some epsom salt and olive oil. I’ve been treating my husband this way weekly and it helps. I “scrub” it into his head with a fine-toothed comb. I do really love that briogio charcoal stuff for myself though.

8553 2018-03-05 03:19:41 Yes they run a OMP(oil metering pump) which squirts a little oil into rotary housing to lube the seals each revolution of the engine. Most people don’t know about this so it is never serviced

8569 2018-03-05 03:18:25 Consider where the oil, tar, and feathers come from. Maybe we can smear them in olive oil (extra virgin is too good for them), cover them them with recycled organic materials, and ride them out on a rail, as was the custom.

8627 2018-03-05 03:10:33 Most reason why people wear the seals out is due to lack of proper oiling, most people don’t service the oil metering pump or use premix. Also carbon build up. They can be very reliable if properly maintained the problem is people don’t know how to properly maintain them.

8642 2018-03-05 03:06:53 I get it & certainly empathize. Something has to give though. Our state legislators are refusing to improve the situation & no one is doing a damn thing about it. Our teachers shouldn’t have to be on public assistance to survive while we give unnecessary rebates to oil companies.

8658 2018-03-05 03:04:43 .@realdonaldtrump is placing tariffs on solar panels costing far more jobs in that industry than what exists in the dying coal industry. I'm waiting for him to bring back Whaling jobs by bringing back Whale Oil as an energy source.

8662 2018-03-05 03:04:18 I found a woman on amazon dot com who doesn't like the movie "The Martian" because it's "propaganda" and "trying to break down cultural barriers". She also buys Oregano oil to keep in her "emergency kit" to "treat a range of infectious illnesses".

Also she doesn't like Obama.

8665 2018-03-05 03:04:07 I've tried it every now and then and it's just not for me. I don't even like foods that have been cooked in coconut oil; I'm definitely in the minority on not liking the Samoas, though, I know!

But sure, give the Oscar to Disney.

8678 2018-03-05 03:01:57 I grew up in northern Alberta & they were called tar sands long before the oil industry decided that term didn't sound too appealing. I see you're quite familiar with industry propaganda techniques.  Obfuscate, deny, & rationalize.  Just like tobacco before they got sued.

8694 2018-03-05 02:59:50 Oil is up 15% in the last year. The US shame industry had 3 nicely survived the attempts of big oil to down it & the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. oilfield, is now producing 3M brls/day.

All this, as doubts linger on the future of oil demand, w/ e-cars & other big changes.

8696 2018-03-05 02:59:32 Peter,
   it normally means getting rid of the dirt, oil and/or other fluids on the road surface after a minor accident however there are few rarer events that is sometimes used for.
8697 2018-03-05 02:59:30 Accck! I think from oil mixed with water to profitable poisons and prisons, stocks and bonds, we are being truly Goldfingered
Socialism is as close to democracy we can hope for and capitalism sure ain't democratic but with a capital D.
8698 2018-03-05 02:59:15 Actually no the rest of the world really doesn’t need you.  The only reason  does 80% Trade (which, US has the surplus of, not us) with US is because of internal issues & Foreign interests stalling our pipeline progression, limiting how we get our oil to market. This is FACT.
8699 2018-03-05 02:59:07 “You ain’t gotta believe me they going door to door telling all the people lies so we can support a war then they go over there start killin niggas for the oil “in god we trust” they say they did it for the lord”
8700 2018-03-05 02:58:55 Okay I loved Coco, but the work and craftsmanship that went into Loving Vincent really needs to be appreciated. I mean 65,000 frames individual painted with oil on canvas. That's a freaking masterpiece.
8701 2018-03-05 02:58:43 Wow coconut oil really did a number on my skin. My face is SO broken out

8705 2018-03-05 02:57:39 i knee coco would win for animated film, but #lovingvincent deserved it so much. the entire film is painted in oil paints by hand by 100 artists every screen. i loved coco but vincent deserved it
8706 2018-03-05 02:57:24 A friend of my roommate had a choice rant about orange juice with fish oil added for omega-3's.  IF YOU EAT YOUR FISH AND DRINK YOUR OJ, YOU DON'T NEED FISH OIL IN YOUR ORANGE JUICE.

8710 2018-03-05 02:56:00 Personally I think your right. Put heavier tariffs on metal, wood, water and oil. I want my country to benifit from not having trade with your country.   The rest of the world will buy our wood, water, metal and oil. Then when you come crawling back it will be to late...

8716 2018-03-05 02:53:25 Of course they only care about profits, that’s why the PC’s kept the taxes down, because these oil companies hire more people when they have less to pay. As soon as taxes went up, and red tape got worse, they started laying off, and quick

8730 2018-03-05 02:51:12 I would tend to agree with that assessment...any trade deal with them would have to be structured very carefully...they're major customers for our oil tho

There is no Justice. Take a look around....
8732 2018-03-05 02:50:55 Too right. During the election people would ask me why I wouldn't budge on my support for DJT when he was hostile to NAFTA. Simple Keystone Pipline, he's interested in our oil the rest of Canada isn't.  It's simple math to me.

8736 2018-03-05 02:49:53 I agree..it didn’t get explained well on the Sunday talk shows. What is the share of imported steel and aluminum that we are consuming. If over 20% share of market, we don’t want to become foreign dependent on these. remember Jimmy Carter, oil embargo, opec. 70s were a disaster !
8737 2018-03-05 02:49:52 Rex was hand picked by Putin and was supposed to help him get that oil.

8742 2018-03-05 02:49:34 So today while tying to take off my nail polish, I put baby oil on the cotton pad instead of nail polish remover, so obviously when I tried it didn’t work. I threw it away and was like whatever. About 10 minutes later I tried again AND DID THE SAME THING... THEN I realized.

8754 2018-03-05 02:47:37 I did see Loving Vincent in the theatre, and it was visually stunning. I will say that oil paintings are better for static shots than tracking shots. And I'm not sure how Chris O'Dowd can be the father of a 25-year-old. #Oscars
8755 2018-03-05 02:47:37 Just some fun facts for y’all. ‘Loving Vincent’ was made entirely by oil paintings. Like can we just stop and think about that for a minute. 95 minutes. 65,000 frames. All oil paintings. Amazing. #oscars
8756 2018-03-05 02:47:32 Who out here just knocking back oil tho?
8757 2018-03-05 02:47:21 Tea tree oil is just a miracle, my scalp is rejuvenated and my pimples are either gone or reduced within one night. #miracledrops
8758 2018-03-05 02:47:20 This #2 would knock out tech/science/NASA/steel/oil/and pretty much every industry.
8759 2018-03-05 02:47:13 It’s my 2nd day oil pulling and I keep spitting everywhere
8760 2018-03-05 02:47:08 its not oil, its lube 
8761 2018-03-05 02:46:40 (chatting with my an-prim friends) i accidentally breathed too deep next to a processed snack food containing corn bymeal products, do any of u fine folx have suggestions on what essential oil diffusers will restabilize my mind chakra?
8762 2018-03-05 02:46:37 Hindi ko alam pero sunflower oil, tea tree oil, jojoba oil for acne/acne marks eh.
8763 2018-03-05 02:46:18 You are turning into a snake oil salesman. For Christ's sake.
8764 2018-03-05 02:46:15 The real reason is oil. Don’t be fooled
8765 2018-03-05 02:46:11 Nope, they don't care about Albertans.  They care about profits. 

People are mostly employed in exploration and construction not production.

That won't change until oil prices improve.
8766 2018-03-05 02:46:10 I mean yay Coco...BUT DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT WENT INTO “LOVING VINCENT”?! LIKE THATS AN INNOVATION IN MOVIE MAKING. IT WAS MADE WITH INDIVIDUAL OIL PAINTS. IN EVERY DIFFERENT SCENE. I recognize your talents, artists. You deserved to win. But congrats coco...
8767 2018-03-05 02:46:09 Trump is right again, against all odds, he is right, we must build up our steel industry as we did our oil industry, we cannot be dependent on our enemies to supply us with steel, steel by products, steel in every industry, militarily must...
WE MUST REBUILD OUR STEEL INDUSTRY
8768 2018-03-05 02:45:48 coco is an amazing movie, it truly is. it’s just that living vincent is a feature length film. thousands of frames go into a feature length film. each frame of loving vincent in a HAND PAINTED OIL PAINTING. LIKE THAT IS SO MUCH TIRELESS HARD WORK THAT IS SO UNDER APPRECIATED
8769 2018-03-05 02:45:45 As they talk about the importance of representation during the speech for Coco, the main problem I'm grappling with is getting oil on my phone screen from eating olives. Fair to say I have it easy
8770 2018-03-05 02:45:39 Lmaoooo this shit cost $120 better get you some baby oil gel and fine glitter and make some shake
8771 2018-03-05 02:45:27 Currently lying in bed listening to the Doors.
I should really oil the hinges.
8772 2018-03-05 02:45:15 I need an oil change
8773 2018-03-05 02:45:07 Note to self: Don't get so excited that @kobebryant  won an Oscar that you absent mindedly grab a hot pan an spill hot oil all over the floor #AcademyAwards2018
8774 2018-03-05 02:44:55 So wished the enormously dedicated and talented painters for Loving Vincent had won the Animated Film at the #Oscars (no Computers! every frame a differennt real oil painting inspired by Van Gogh) but Disney’s Coco was too strong
8775 2018-03-05 02:44:51 If y’all have never used a face oil as part of your night time routine then you really ain’t living your skin is MF POPPIN when you wake up the next day
8776 2018-03-05 02:44:45 How the fuck did Loving Vincent, which had a hand-painted oil painting for every single frame, not win Best Animated Film?!?

What. The. Fuck.
8777 2018-03-05 02:44:42 Long live Loving Vincent. No Disney budget and the first hand drawn OIL paintings! Definitely worth checking out
8778 2018-03-05 02:44:22 i bought an essential oil diffuser so like??? emotional crisis = over

8780 2018-03-05 02:44:18 Who drinks straight oil?
8781 2018-03-05 02:44:16 As much as I love #Coco, #LovingVincent went so underrated and under appreciated as there has never been and probably will never be another film animated completely in oil paintings! #Oscars2018
8782 2018-03-05 02:44:14 Don’t be so crude.... like the oil in Saudi Arabia
8783 2018-03-05 02:43:55 My mom was Italian, I put olive oil in pretty much everything.
8784 2018-03-05 02:43:53 Loving Vincent was fucking robbed it was an animated feature film that moved boundaries cause it was made with oil fucking paint it made me cry it was so beautiful I'm fucking mad
8785 2018-03-05 02:43:34 Steamed Brussel sprouts until they are ready to just melt in your mouth then sliced in half, fried in olive oil, garlic, salt, pepper along w/sesame seeds beats mashed potatoes and fries every night of the week. And there's no food that gives me such a "nutrient high" afterward.
8786 2018-03-05 02:43:30 Loving Vincent was animated in 65,000 oil paintings. How the fuck does it not win?????

8796 2018-03-05 02:42:09 Nothing against Coco but Loving Vincent was made of 65,000 individual oil on canvas paintings.

8805 2018-03-05 02:40:30 Before the war, Donald Rumsfeld explicitly stated that Saddam was inconvenient to the building of an oil pipeline into Jordan. After the war, he confirmed -explicitly- that oil was primary reason.
8806 2018-03-05 02:40:30 Sorry to hear that. Glad you found a solution. Do what works for you & change if you need to. I was pritikin, vegetarian, vegan & low fat at various times over 30 years. A bottle of oil would spoil I used so little. I still got diabetes. LC works for me.

8810 2018-03-05 02:40:03 this morning my man told me that my skin looks nice so i guess dipping my entire head into a bucket of coconut oil every night is finally paying off

8826 2018-03-05 02:37:04 how many refining jobs being added in AB as a result of #kindermorgan? zero.

because even if AB needs those jobs, their big oil overloads wont allow it... 

US and perhaps Asian refineries will hire plenty though...

I highly recommend tee tree oil in ya bath & using baby oil to shave and moisturize 
8893 2018-03-05 02:29:31 So I see post about foundations for dry skin and other makeup products for dry skin.

BUT IS THERE ANY PRODUCTS FOR OIL SKIN. A GIRL GOT A WEDDING TO GO TO IN JUNE AND THOSE THINGS TAKE FOR HOURS TO END.
8894 2018-03-05 02:29:30 Why am I just discovering tea tree oil?
8895 2018-03-05 02:29:29 For some reason we decided to have dinner at Red Robin. Prob never again. Poor service. Fries saturated in oil. Like, press down on one & watch the oil seep out.
8896 2018-03-05 02:29:26 If you go blind I'll describe the view
8897 2018-03-05 02:29:13 Let me oil my hair and take my shower... i was legit stressed over that bag man 
8898 2018-03-05 02:28:53 We need to charge a little something extra for the 3.4 mmbls of oil exported tp the US.  Abrogate any trade agreements and raise that price. 3.4 mm might be a bit hard to replace...
8899 2018-03-05 02:28:53 I've been subbing the butter for more olive oil but that's just because I'm losing my lactose tolerance

8905 2018-03-05 02:27:51 I don't think I've ever been more confident in a decision more than my purchase of shea & almond oil moisturizing body wash.
8906 2018-03-05 02:27:47 I keep saying trump reminds me of a snake oil salesman, he says he can fix everything but he knows he can't. He lied to his constituents and they bought it hook line and sinker. Reality is slowly setting in. We need to retrain the coal miners.

8912 2018-03-05 02:26:37 got peppermint oil in my eye
8913 2018-03-05 02:26:33 Because of the north sea oil. The Norwegian Government protects property rights, allows markets to function has a 25% corporate tax rate.

8920 2018-03-05 02:25:23 And I've lived in Daytona my whole life, I actually have a receipt for an oil change from Big Bill France from my grandparents in the early 40s.  Days of Thunder was OK, Stroker Ace come on that was horrible.
8921 2018-03-05 02:25:22 Looking forward to taking a shower and laying in the dark with my oil diffuser on just listening to music.
8922 2018-03-05 02:25:11 Do you sleep well at night harassing children as a grown man? Don’t you have better things to do, like take the snake oil that Alex Jones tries to sell you?
8923 2018-03-05 02:24:48 Nothing better than a good shower, shaving then rubbing on coconut oil and shea butter 
8924 2018-03-05 02:24:28 Every time I take ours in to the dealer (oil change, whatever), that damn light comes on after we leave

8932 2018-03-05 02:23:12 Are humidifiers cheap? Lol I have one that’s super old and smells like essential oils from when my mom was an oil freak and I need a new one

8935 2018-03-05 02:22:21 GFY!  Knife rides on the damaged edge and sets the fill level. If you didn’t splurge for stainless steel, apply a light coat of oil on the blade before storing; rust is a bitch on those and ruins the knife edge. Never seen the purple stuff in use, that’s so cool!

8941 2018-03-05 02:21:52 I heard his is planning on “revitalizing” the whale oil industry with a HUGE new fleet of sail-powered whalers.  That’s gotta be eco-friendly . . ..
8942 2018-03-05 02:21:51 This means that we put tariffs on, for example, wine and olive oil, which we don't produce ourselves, for the benefit of French wine producers and Mediterranean farmers. Outside the EU, we could buy such products far cheaper elsewhere.

Guess your "friends" in the oil industry found a way to operate without you.
8955 2018-03-05 02:19:23 Definitely ask your doc before you take anything. There are a lot of natural things and supplements you can try. Magnesium sup, diffusing peppermint oil, baths with oils and Epsom salt, hot teas, and staying extremely hydrated (like so hydrated haha)

8963 2018-03-05 02:18:15 I lived in Alberta then & remember Trudeau ruining the oil industry. Miles of rigs laying on their sides getting transported back to USA.  PetroCanada inheriting the fields without ever discovering a drop of oil themselves. Very unpopular in Alberta.  Glad to see it carries on

8976 2018-03-05 02:17:02 Government knew they signed up for open borders and we had north sea oil bonanza yet Brickies could not get any work. Are we electing fools or is all this intentional. They wanted to pay us £7.10 giro rather than let us build houses.
8977 2018-03-05 02:16:54 Tillerson doesn't want to keep it's off Putin either. Big oil money possible if sanctions are lifted. He has no interest in protecting the US by pushing back on Russia! Another traitor!!!! Rex must leave. Total derilection of duty!!!

9037 2018-03-05 02:09:56 Money drawing oil body butter .... Available for a limited time only in 4 or 8 oz.
9038 2018-03-05 02:09:55 Yeah I'll buy that off you! I'm an oil slick so the lighter the better
9039 2018-03-05 02:09:36 ini olive oil yaa?
9040 2018-03-05 02:09:30 on the way to omaha yesterday, i passed a billboard somewhere in iowa that advertised an oil change that came with a complimentary steak dinner. talk about innovation.
9041 2018-03-05 02:09:08 Agreed but clearly many still do as so many did on $SX that fell for the snake oil bs.
9042 2018-03-05 02:08:58 Shea butter with coconut oil on top of it is THEEEE BEST combo ever 
9043 2018-03-05 02:08:43 lol yeah, that i do. i keep nivea, hemp moisturizer and baby oil fully stocked at all times

9045 2018-03-05 02:08:15 You can leave it over night but best to add in cuts of lemon in it. Use hot water and don’t leave it over night, due to the oil grease.
9046 2018-03-05 02:07:57 As long as they mix up the diesel and cooking oil in some way, I'm all for it.

9049 2018-03-05 02:07:44 I have baby oil. 
9050 2018-03-05 02:07:37 My only complaint is how long this took. Please make #Syria next on your agenda. Our illegal invasion and occupation is just a repeat of the absolute mess we made in #Iraq. "Assad is bad" is a smokescreen; the real reason we're there is the disputed oil rich #GolanHeights area.
9051 2018-03-05 02:07:21 You have butter on your head. The US wanting to force Russia to supply gas to Ukraine is highly dispicable. Russia is a sovereign state. The gas & oil belongs to Russia and only RU can decide wether to supply or not. Ukr can be supplied if they pay their bills. Very simple.

9068 2018-03-05 02:04:27 Democrats are great at propaganda. They're good at manipulating unconventional people with sleight hand. Both Clintons spoke with four mouths.

9072 2018-03-05 02:03:15 So is it of concern that we've already had 449 quakes in just two months versus all of 2017?  Are the oil companies just ignoring the restrictions put in place last year or were they time-limited/expired?
9073 2018-03-05 02:03:14 Venezuela is one of the top five suppliers of foreign oil to the United States. Bilateral trade in goods between both countries reached $16.1 billion in 2016. United States exports to Venezuela totalled $5.3 billion in 2016, while imports from Venezuela totalled $10.9 billion.
9074 2018-03-05 02:03:10 Or how much time we waste in traffic when we could’ve created a high speed rail like 30 years ago but haven’t because our representatives are beholden to car manufacturers, and oil industry?

9081 2018-03-05 02:02:17 Yeah I'm talking about those drones and planes that your "heroes" use to drop bombs on children and hospitals in poor countries in order to control the flow of oil

9091 2018-03-05 02:00:20 Mark Bridges: "I’m always excited when Paul Thomas Anderson calls. We’ve done porn stars to hippies to oil drillers. You always wonder if you can do justice to the era, and with Daniel Day-Lewis you have to up your game."
9092 2018-03-05 02:00:15 Sure, if you don’t like clean water, air, companies drilling for oil and destroying parks, a stable economy with provisions to protect consumers and investors, a more measured, helpful and peaceful world diplomacy etc, etc-that Trump’s undermined, then yeah, he didn’t do much...

9100 2018-03-05 01:57:26 Brooklyn would use coconut oil instead of butter for the roux.
9101 2018-03-05 01:56:54 I hate shitty spray applicator bottles. How TF am I supposed to use your fabulous silicone and mineral oil free product if I can’t apply it?!?!
9102 2018-03-05 01:56:47 Yeah exactly!! Especially because they specify that their palm oil is sustainable

9114 2018-03-05 01:55:18 The 4 Janus civil cases so far have been handled by two experienced OIL Attorneys who primarily handle denaturalization. They're aware summons are required. It seems perhaps in Mehmood that there was an AUSA handling it after filing which might account for the delay

9118 2018-03-05 01:54:18 Neighbors & friends: Just like car engines, generators require oil! During an extended power outage you should check the oil level every 12 hours of continuous use and add as needed.

9122 2018-03-05 01:53:45 Fantastic,but that’s not helping you convince anyone in BC to risk our most precious resource on profits for foreign oil companies oil tanking oil to foreign shores for Alberta tax revenue.

9129 2018-03-05 01:52:14 Avocado oil is really good too and not as expensive-plus it has the highest smoking point so you can use it in all manners of cooking.  #health

9138 2018-03-05 01:51:10 Your incorrect use of your, when you should be using you’re, while you’re calling someone ignorant is quite ironic. Your beef with confederation has noting to do with oil tankers and transfer payments has nothing to do with B.C.
9139 2018-03-05 01:51:02 Nope. His great grandfather was the oil tycoon Armand Hammer.
9140 2018-03-05 01:50:55 For me It’s Shea butter and Jamaican black castor oil. Thanks to you.
9141 2018-03-05 01:50:36 Theres that arguement again, If you use oil you cant be concerned about a pipeline built to send unrefined bitumen directly to Asia for them to use and multinational companies to make billions off. Totally makes sense.
9142 2018-03-05 01:49:58 I’m so sorry, the fear of being removed was worse than the pain. I’m using medical cannabis oil, not hemp oil. It got me thru the withdrawal. Only 7 ER visits where I was treated like an addict. Good luck

9147 2018-03-05 01:49:09 The funny thing is that Gulf State influence on our politics has been a known factor since the nineties and we've taken it for granted because we needed affordable oil and now that we don't need to.
9148 2018-03-05 01:48:56 This sage oil set my life right.  What was I doing with my life before dabbling in this?

9162 2018-03-05 01:47:22 OIL - District Court Section is the prosecuting office in these. It is primarily staffed with defense attorneys. They don’t know a complaint requires a summons. Most of these cases are so clear it won’t require much out of the plaintiffs, sadly.
9163 2018-03-05 01:47:21 は？
9164 2018-03-05 01:47:13 until big oil's grip on our economy and consumer options for energy diminishes, we are all reliant on fossil fuels. that sucks. but we've got to start somewhere, so protesting this shitty pipeline and holding it off until KM gives up is where we stand.

9171 2018-03-05 01:45:47 Lmao yes. It’s the palm oil part I got wrong. It’s too thick. Wasn’t hot enough I guess.

9186 2018-03-05 01:42:53 Pimento is roasted red pepper then cut into small slivers and jarred in oil. Our green olives have pimento slivers in them.

9189 2018-03-05 01:42:31 We wrap it in prosciutto and use a bit of flavoured oil, and it cooks up really nicely
9190 2018-03-05 01:42:24 Up the street. Some idiots had a drum of motor oil that had leaked.
9191 2018-03-05 01:42:21 I’ve been thinking about doing the collar for Ellie since we no longer have Cloe. She’s the opposite of Mookie. No hair, so put like frontline on her it’s we just poured oil on her. 
9192 2018-03-05 01:42:16 Well avocado oil is good. So it was okay I guess.
9193 2018-03-05 01:42:14 Only liberals believe oil drilling off the coast means hundreds of oil rigs spewing oil into the ocean 20’ off the sand.
9194 2018-03-05 01:42:02 Life hack: Do you know what's in your lube? Harmful chemicals can cause irritation or worse. Try cod liver oil. It's all natural and a source of essential vitamins including vitamin D, vitamin A, and omega-3 fatty acids. Get your fish on!
9195 2018-03-05 01:41:52 watch out,, the goblins in your closet are about to attack !!!
9196 2018-03-05 01:41:52 If you like Canada can easily stop our shipments of metals, oil, wood, water, and electricity to name a few.
9197 2018-03-05 01:41:42 #Pressurewasher Tips: Always check the oil and gas levels on a gas power washer. Only use unleaded gasoline.
9198 2018-03-05 01:41:42 So can we stop pretending like Rex is anything other than what he appears to be, an agent of Exxon hoping to unlock the $1 trillion oil and gas deal currently blocked by Russian sanctions?
9199 2018-03-05 01:41:26 ㅠㅠ

9218 2018-03-05 01:38:31 I don't feel like doing it most days. Still have to wash and detangle, oil, do protective styles. Twist outs only last 2 days and it's too short to just throw in a pony tail/bun like before.

9220 2018-03-05 01:38:20 @ShanFoods, YOUR PICKLES'S INGREDIENTS ARE ALRIGHT AND AUTHENTIC, EXCEPT EDIBLE  OIL. 

YOU ARE USING SUNFLOWER OIL, WHICH SEEMS CHOLESTROLIC, TICKLING  AND ITCHING TO THE  THROAT. 
PLEASE  USE MUSTARD  OIL,TO MAKE THE PICKLE REALY AUTHENTIC, TO THE CORE.
9221 2018-03-05 01:38:17 Also, Ekofisk was affected with Conoco shutting North Sea oil fields due to bad weather. Fields being restarted now, so should be good

9223 2018-03-05 01:38:09 That’s what I currently have  my skin is seriously so sensitive to oil i hate it
9224 2018-03-05 01:38:05 Yeah, you’re quite the snake oil salesman, but your products just don’t work anymore than your staff that disappears faster than annual plants that only last one season.  You’re only as authentic as your failures clearly demonstrate who you really are.
9225 2018-03-05 01:38:03 What about the whale oil industry??  Please bring back the whaling fleet, Mr. President!!  MWGA-- Make Whaling Great Again.

9227 2018-03-05 01:37:10 No, better yet...let’s call it for what it is. It’s not about a pipeline at all, it’s about what comes after the pipeline, after Westridge. That this is about oil tankers and oil spills and let Canada decide in the next federal election!
9228 2018-03-05 01:36:52 5 on 5 the Oil Kings beat the Pats 2-1. Both teams had a SH goal, but that Pats were 5/5 on the PP, Edmonton 1/4. 

Final score 7-4 Regina. Edmonton back on the road on Tuesday in Saskatoon.
9229 2018-03-05 01:36:51 Assad will help himself to their homeland. Putin will help himself to their oil.

9233 2018-03-05 01:35:20 Ur kidding right? Strongest rebound you mean? It couldn’t go anywhere else but up. I’m in the oil and gas industry and there no work, none, nothing at all. Check out LinkedIn, see how many people are hurting for work. The public sector sure is strong, but not the private sector
9234 2018-03-05 01:34:53 did you get that plate from a guy in the parking lot whose grill is made out of half an oil drum
9235 2018-03-05 01:34:52 何もしなくていい休日ってのが多分元旦以来なのにTwitterに来ちゃう感じね
9236 2018-03-05 01:34:26 I’m changing the oil in my car and rotating the tires. I’m listening to oldies but goodies. Even with oil on my work clothes and dirt under my nails I’m a better person than those Hollywood Punks.
9237 2018-03-05 01:34:26 Wrong, crude oil is the backbone of a successful economy. If books disappeared there would still be authors telling their stories, the medium changes, not the messages.
9238 2018-03-05 01:34:10 Me: *puts Coconut oil in lashes*
Me: *immediatly starts crying*

9251 2018-03-05 01:32:29 HOW TO FIX DRY AND FLAKY SKIN THREAD
First you need to wash your face. Wash it. Double cleanse it. We want to use oil to hydrate our skin and get the grime out.
9252 2018-03-05 01:32:22 It’s oil against the planet
9253 2018-03-05 01:32:20 Well that was a tough final. But congrats to @JackieFricke and @Finke_racing on the win at @NoProblemRacewa @ArtofFast @JEPistons1 @1320Travel @Lucas_Oil @WirtgenGroup
9254 2018-03-05 01:32:16 I don’t think anyone is saying NYC can’t have good bbq. People are saying NYC doesn’t have good bbq. Pretentiousness and bbq go together like oil and water. #NeedABetterAnalogy

Is their anybody who talks for Peace from that elite circle. #BeHuman.
9259 2018-03-05 01:31:46 21/ Moreover, the fact that costs were only short-run had nothing to do with the policy content of the adjustment program and everything to do with the Mexican oil discoveries, which allowed Mexico to buy its way out of and not adhere to the program’s targets after the first year
9260 2018-03-05 01:31:34 Waking up and realizing just how sunburnt I got from our midday snorkeling adventure yesterday. Hoping my #VCO and #jojoba oil help my skin.

9264 2018-03-05 01:31:17 The Internet is one disrupting element. The 3-D printing technology is another disrupting element. It promises to decrease resource use and allow for supply chain management that is frugal. I imagine jobs will vanish and the oil industry will be automated. Big disruption ahead.

9275 2018-03-05 01:30:05 Something infers singular. As in I’ve done one thing during my time in Washington. American people must refer to native Americans? Where he soiled their land and is stealing bears ears for oil exploration. I can’t stand this #Winning #BlueWave2018 #BanAssaultWeapons #NeverAgain
9276 2018-03-05 01:30:03 And still a lot of oil.

9281 2018-03-05 01:29:24 LOL. Water with oil sludge in it is for the American people? You mustn't like them very much.

9283 2018-03-05 01:29:21 There are estimated 500,000 oil and gas workers in Canada rallying for the resource everyday rain shine plus and minus temperatures.Many from the lower mainland fly in and out.Some from as far as Newfoundland commuting bi weekly to NEBC.This fig doesn’t included related workers

9285 2018-03-05 01:28:49 I never had avocado toast until that RW guy insulted millennials with it. I didn't even know it was a thing. It's super-easy to make (toast with a mixture of ripe avocado/olive oil/pinch of salt glopped on it) and you can have it for breakfast, lunch or dinner, or a snack.
9286 2018-03-05 01:28:41 はじめてのストーリー、だいたい食べ物説
9287 2018-03-05 01:28:37 Yes, you are correct. Heating any fat damages it and it can become inflammatory. Olive oil is a fragile oil so heat it only as a saute or cold.
9288 2018-03-05 01:28:26 Sometimes I think olive oil gives things a weird taste!
9289 2018-03-05 01:28:18 If the oil companies give enough in terms of jobs and cash there will cooperate with the oil industry. Problem isn't about the env damage although some do appear to have ethics; problem is the compensation package and health problems but these problems mean nada with cash/jobs.
9290 2018-03-05 01:27:51 I forgot to tell you Abby's green bean recipe!  Break the ends off 1 lb. of raw green beans,toss with diced Roma tomatoes, olive oil, lemon juice, salt, pepper and the juice of one Roma tomato.  Roast at 425F for 20-25 minutes.

9305 2018-03-05 01:23:57 I wonder how much this Mexican motor oil company has to pay to have around 538 signs up at this AAA event.
9306 2018-03-05 01:23:57 We Americans don't steal oil gas water from countries how did ISIS build a oil pipe line yo Europe how why
9307 2018-03-05 01:23:51 The price per barrel of oil is far more important than laws to these people
9308 2018-03-05 01:23:32 Silk drills his own oil

9311 2018-03-05 01:22:54 I’m getting a four loko aromatherapy oil diffuser for my room
9312 2018-03-05 01:22:45 Again. One creates wealth in Canada. The other suppresses it, while ignoring same industry in their own country, why? If I’m an American oil baron, I’m funding these useful idiots in Canada blocking oil, absolutely. Best investment ever made.
9313 2018-03-05 01:22:30 Make up brushes washed

Exfoliate 
Coconut oil hair mask
9314 2018-03-05 01:21:59 Put away a bottle of red by myself after that shift. Lemme use this shower oil and I’m knocking for ten hrs
9315 2018-03-05 01:21:42 I watched two videos on Egusi & they both said not to bleach the oil. One even said only boil for 30 seconds.  I’ve learned my lesson
9316 2018-03-05 01:21:42 yoooo colourpop released some sheer iridescent lipglosses that have jojoba oil/are bomb, but i dig the opacity on this lipstick a lot

9318 2018-03-05 01:21:29 One of the best feelings in the world is when they put the oil sheen and mousse on your scalp after getting braids
9319 2018-03-05 01:21:23 The goal here is to save the city with least amount of civilian casualties,,mission accomplished...why fight when the city is given up,,and we can track the isis to see where they go after? 

Funny they went straight to turkey after

No wonder Turkey was biggest buyer of isis oil
9320 2018-03-05 01:21:18 Native Americans are not surprised, this is how it always goes, white man gives land to the natives until they find oil, or precious metals/gems, then they take the land back, all for greed, and only greed!!!

9322 2018-03-05 01:21:11 It’s just that the palm oil is too thick or something
9323 2018-03-05 01:21:08 My dad had me run to the store to get oil for his truck, but he also gave me money for gas for my car since I ran to the store for him. #ItsTheLittleThings
9324 2018-03-05 01:20:57 The motivation behind Americans suppressing Canadian oil while ignoring oil in USA while USA reaches record export levels. Hmm.. never mind supposed covert Russian interference...
9325 2018-03-05 01:20:49 getting an oil change in the morning after my TB test.
9326 2018-03-05 01:20:48 Lol meh. I can smell the palm oil. Too strong. Just need to work on getting the beginning right. Every other thing is straightforward. Thank you 
9327 2018-03-05 01:20:19 The sad thing is that folks believe the stuff about the oil industry being perfect. No corporation has a perfect performance record. Best in the world regulations mean nothing without proper oversight and penalties. We get what we avoid thinking of and facing. Look in the mirror.

9332 2018-03-05 01:20:02 With the new proposed tariffs, maybe we should start being self sufficient with our oil and gas - and the US should pay a little more for it
9333 2018-03-05 01:20:01 If it’s not your oil light, you don’t have to immediately attend to it.
9334 2018-03-05 01:19:29 I dont know about anyone else's god, but my God put it there to be a blessing to humanity (Genesis 1:28).

So walk on the grass, shoot a deer, & dig up the oil. But when you're done, tend the grass, manage the deer population, and remediate the site. That's biblical stewardship.

9351 2018-03-05 01:15:29 Do you think US environmental foundations don’t really care about climate change, but in reality are secret fronts for American oil interests?

9353 2018-03-05 01:14:31 Who should know better about stroking than all of the legislators like yourself who get stroked by oil and gas to do their bidding. It's one thing to sell out the state. It's a crime to sell out its children by refusing to do right by their educators. Shame on you, you nasty man.
9354 2018-03-05 01:14:30 Justin, it is time to cut off oil to the States, stand up to Trump!

9363 2018-03-05 01:12:49 The Trump administration is opening up the Atlantic Coast to oil and gas exploration. Air guns that are used to find underwater oil reserves threaten to overpower the communications of underwater mammals like whales. #noisepollution #ees028

9370 2018-03-05 01:11:41 I have a frizz problem too but I've tried a lot and have just accepted I will just always have frizz. I have been using argan oil for a long time but decided to see how coconut cream leave in conditioner would do instead. Been a few weeks and I think I like it more.

9622 2018-03-05 00:27:44 F*ck China  and their cheap sh*t. That’s all I gotta say....We need American Steel for the oil and gas industry now !!! That will put thousands back to work !!!
9623 2018-03-05 00:27:31 Until Trump sells it off to the highest bidder to tear it up for oil, mining, etc.etc..

9628 2018-03-05 00:26:44 How I put olive oil in the freezer 
9629 2018-03-05 00:26:27 What your oil / petroleum industry? Still dependent on the countries you invade under false pretences?
9630 2018-03-05 00:26:22 So what is "authentic British culture"? If your cutoff date is 1950, this would exclude curry and kebabs, naan bread and baguette, olive oil and balsamic vinegar, mozzarella and camembert, rocket salad and peking duck. I can't wait to move into your world.

9633 2018-03-05 00:25:55 @captsingh Think there was a previous story about the US #Shipping being involved in oil transfers too. Sanctions are not working.
9634 2018-03-05 00:25:21 @Sabra why do you use soybean oil instead of olive oil?
9635 2018-03-05 00:25:09 You f'd up.  I'm retired and my stocks dropped after your uninformed announcement.  I'm also from an oil producing state. You are screwing my state.  Stick to real estate which you probably seem to be screwing up.

9638 2018-03-05 00:23:45 Getting the right fit is a monumental effort. For long-term you're going to have to worry about chafing if it's that tight. Try lube/oil/lotion of some sort and it might help.

9640 2018-03-05 00:23:17 Prosperity clearly came with EU. North Sea oil could have helped but Thatcher spent it on unemployment. They put millions on disability to hide the true figure. A price worth paying to asset strip the country.
9641 2018-03-05 00:23:10 And to sell us oil or get oil from us.  I am confused on that issue.  He is horrid.

Heat on med or a notch lower you don’t wanna cook too fast. Hope this helps

9647 2018-03-05 00:21:59 So you're saying that their military is bombing unarmed civilians? Seriously? Or is it that they're attacking the US funded and equipped terrorists meant to overthrow Assad so the Saudis can run that pipeline through and compete with Russian oil and gas?

9651 2018-03-05 00:21:28 "... or WE'RE going to get hurt." That's GOP calculus on any issue. It's about protecting themselves. ONLY THEMSELVES.

9662 2018-03-05 00:20:02 No, what I am saying is that US really didn't care until SAA crossed the river and tried to block the SDF which was an aggressive act that US responded to. Before that, US didn't  care. 
It's thousands of miles of empty desert. With some crappy old oil fields that Isis wrecked.

9689 2018-03-05 00:17:20 I used natural peanut butter prob 2 tbs, 1tbs sesame oil, 2ish tbs soy sauce, 2 tbs hot water, and Sriracha to taste.  Cooked the noodles separate and put them in a bowl without any water and added the sauce I made and stirred it up. Takes a lot of tasting to personal preference.

9767 2018-03-05 00:05:33 Man City got the oil barons in without a care for making a profit. We got Stan. Ever since he took over, #afc have gone backwards. I lay the blame for this gradual decline over many years squarely on him.The man acts as though he doesn’t care.He just doesn’t get it. #KroenkeOut

9769 2018-03-05 00:05:09 From my perspective, the "rest of the world" has been actively pursuing viable substitutes at a greatly accelerated pace since 2008. Recent events will serve only to "force their hand," perhaps somewhat prematurely, but certainly not by much. The yuan/oil contract launches 3/26.+

9786 2018-03-05 00:03:54 @colbertlateshow  and manipulate their chosen politicians to get the legislation they want and not what is best for the citizens or environment of our state. One thing that Justice wanted in order to give the teachers a raise was dictated by the oil/gas industry to make a raise

Snakeoil salesmens will run off with your money. 

I would seek coconut oil extract done by a pro. DIY if ya must
9792 2018-03-05 00:03:12 Dear Mr. Trump, please stop buying oil from Venezuela's Dictatorship. Don't worry for us, we already starving here. We need take this criminals out from the power. #RT
9793 2018-03-05 00:03:07 brita pitcher: a pitcher that filters water, so you can use tap water and after it’s filtered it won’t taste like tap and that way we won’t (or we shouldn’t have to) but bottled water, just bottles
air fryer: a healthy alternative for frying that uses less oil

9795 2018-03-05 00:03:02 @colbertlateshow legislators are the HIGHEST paid in the nation while our teachers rank 48th.  The inequity is glaring. The politicians are all in the pockets of the Oil/Gas/Coal industry who contribute large amounts of money to their campaigns, their lobbyists frequently fete

9797 2018-03-05 00:02:56 Can I retire now? I'm ready to live my  dream of running away to the Tuscan hills, renovating a crumbling old villa with some bumbling but loveable builders and then discovering I now also own a 20 acre olive grove to make world class oil. Sigh. #dreams
9798 2018-03-05 00:02:28 CBD oil is being exploited by charlatans just to make a fast buck from the vulnerable people who genuinely need relief from their medical conditions i know because I’m one of those people. We need quality control.
9799 2018-03-05 00:02:16 Forecasts predict that Trump's Tariffs on Steel will hurt the US Oil industry, which relies heavily on steel pipelines.    
Who wants to see US oil production decrease?  
Vladimir Putin!

9802 2018-03-05 00:02:08 Lets agree that we are talking about the Ashkenazis
They own
Banks
Government
Big biz
Courthouses
Oil
Police
Politicians
Hollywood
Media
Royalty
Army's
and since they own every Country's debt, they own all of us.

Can we agree ?
That was not very hard, was it ?

9804 2018-03-05 00:01:42 It's not just the EPA, the whole Cabinet's like that.

Commerce:hired away from a money laundry.

Treasury: predatory lender.

Justice: segregationist.

State: oil baron.

Labor: labor elimination investor.

Energy: "Nukular's involved?"

They're all like that, cartoonishly bad.
9805 2018-03-05 00:01:41 US doesnt care about the Syrian oil fields there?  LOL  they want to keep them away from Damascus to harm their rebuilding. Of course US doesn't "need" it but know that the Syrians would. Think a little please...
9806 2018-03-05 00:01:35 Excess Oil is prolly from a ph imbalance in your skin. I don’t believe in “oily skin” and how often are you sanitizing your Clarisonic? Those are hot spots for bacteria

9810 2018-03-05 00:01:20 Can and have built - but like changing my oil or building a deck. I just don’t care to.  For gaming and light workflow - 16x2 is enough for me.

9816 2018-03-05 00:00:13 Morning Report: The West Texas Intermediate oil prices (WTI) kept mainly in negative territory last week as the bulls and bears battled it out within a range between the $60 and $64 regions.
9817 2018-03-05 00:00:07 Olive, jojoba, and sweet almond oils are all wonderful elixirs for hair. If your hair is thick and heavy, coconut oil works wonders.
