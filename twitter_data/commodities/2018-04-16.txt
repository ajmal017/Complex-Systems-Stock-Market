40 2018-04-16 21:25:37 It’s not a lie though. We need more capacity. If we had less constraints the entire country would benefit. Other commodities could get more access. Like wheat.
41 2018-04-16 21:21:51 The image shows a handbag, shoes, a skirt being worn or carried by a model. All textile based commodities. Do you think presenting an article on inventions with an image of female body parts was a deliberate or unconscious trope?

Econet Wireless Zimbabwe tariffs are unbearably too high and are partly to blame in pushing the prizes of commodities up. I was amazed to find that they are the highest in Africa. Why punishing customers that have supported you even in their hardest times.

128 2018-04-16 14:12:32 Farm production used to be strictly controlled by the govt, but since the 90s farmers have been able to choose what to grow. So they pursue capital, which almost never means affordable, domestically distributed produce. Helloooo, high-margin commodities for high-volume trade.

Government use to give out canned beef with commodities Oh! And canned pork too! Neither were good but that canned meat?...was horrible!!!

234 2018-04-16 03:04:55 Thank you. Just new to day trading. Still lots to learn. Have a meeting with a professional commodities trader to learn some more stuff that you can’t get from a book
235 2018-04-16 03:04:46 and otherwise, we’re competing for justice/mercy/dignity/compassion as if such were scarce commodities.  each arguing the merits of who deserves what.  class action ~ locomotive
236 2018-04-16 02:59:03 This is always the case when two owners of commodities both exclusively private and exclusively social and general.
237 2018-04-16 02:59:01 Calm down. I was pointing out that taxing commodities used by the homeless hurts the homeless.
Why is that controversial?
238 2018-04-16 02:46:30 Sometimes the impending doom rocks me so hard I don’t sleep at all on Sundays and go into the work week already frazzled. So frustrating.  I’ve read medication and therapy helps... but these “commodities” are pretty limited in rural USA areas, such as where I live.
239 2018-04-16 02:43:04 It takes approximately 1,70,000 flowers to create just one pound of #saffron. No wonder, the world's most expensive #spice does require some bit of perseverance. #DidYouKnow #Commodities
240 2018-04-16 02:29:03 That’s ridiculous. People are not commodities. We need an organized response to provide lasting solutions.

242 2018-04-16 02:17:27 Yikes this is catching my attention this morning. More than 200 million eggs recalled in the U.S. on suspected salmonella poisoning. North Carolina farm supplied products to nine states including NY, NJ and Colorado: FDA says. #eggs #contamination @business #commodities
243 2018-04-16 02:14:31 Capitalism thrives on your addiction, it thrives on your weakness in the face of its tantalizing, poisonous, commodities.
244 2018-04-16 02:03:18 Yes we don't want that. As for it being applied to other commodities it's unlikely I know because most of those are exported and it would not work well!

247 2018-04-16 01:44:38 I still remember when, along with a can of peanut butter, that month's commodities had a can of honey. PB&H has a special place in my heart. It was fun to be (occasionally) sated as a kid.
248 2018-04-16 01:37:15 hi, looks like commodities. that's cool, but gotta learn about futures contracts

257 2018-04-16 00:37:36 Love your tweet @PremierScottMoe but the urgency of this country scrambling for (a) #pipeline is 3 YEARS overdue like this countries financials. We have great commodities in many industries!!! Just idiot leaders trying to play both sides with them...
258 2018-04-16 00:37:32 If by commodities you mean crude oil, then yes.  Softs, grains, meats, and industrial metals aren't interested in Syria.  

Dollar is about twin deficits, not Syria IMO
259 2018-04-16 00:32:36 Democrats use communities like commodities and this offends me.
