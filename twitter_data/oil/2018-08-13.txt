64 2018-08-13 23:53:58 You keep saying they’re a ‘re-hash’, but I get the impression that you’re just parroting that from right-wing media. Nationalised industry in the 70’s did not cause the OPEC Oil crisis. The policy is to take back into public hands when franchises expire: many poor services now.

67 2018-08-13 23:53:51 Lmao I’ve never used any other oil except EVOO, even in cakes. Veg oil is the worst lie, omega 6, highly oxidative oil extracted chemically at extremely high heat, fake shit. This combined with sugar causes heart disease. Plebs think it’s health food

Sad !
68 2018-08-13 23:53:50 The worst is part of this cook is the meat can stall out at 155. Patience to get through. The other hard part of smoking is fighting the temptation to open the hood. 1 more thing. Get a Weber chimney starter and newspapers. Don’t buy starter fluid. You’ll taste the oil.
69 2018-08-13 23:53:50 Validate a viewpoint or open your eyes to think maybe there is something else going on. It’s why I made the oil change joke earlier. I can feel like my car needs it, but then I have a decide that tracks it to validate my thought is true. That device is real handy lol.

97 2018-08-13 23:50:33 England (London) makes more money exporting Scottish oil than it does raising UK taxes #fact 

Let that sink in. 

How many taxes are there? 

@UKLabour know exactly what I’m saying, so why this shite about the  “Gt. Britain,” Rule Britannia bullshit. 

England needs Scotland!

108 2018-08-13 23:49:17 In the meantime this admins is subsidizing the gas & oil boys by STEALING federal land to sell our resources to them @ undisclosed $ while also subsidizing them to the tune of $20 BILLION yearly

115 2018-08-13 23:48:43 That makes sense. The Saudis know their oil is a finite resource, they need to diversify and look at future sources of income. I’m curious to know what that partnership would look like.
116 2018-08-13 23:48:42 The world will never know how sad I am
My pain is water and oil that can’t mix

A child in the lonely ocean. I want to make it known too
My value, everyday

152 2018-08-13 23:42:56 you're welcome ^^ in the world of baking blogs, olive oil in muffins and desserts is a popular health food thing. I've only tried it once and it turned out pleasantly alright, but it's just not for me

159 2018-08-13 23:41:38 Two-thirds of U.S. oil producers failed to live within their means in the second quarter, even as oil rose above $70 a barrel. Collectively, 50 major U.S. oil companies reported in their second-quarter results that they have spent $2 billion more than they took in

162 2018-08-13 23:41:22 More than 99% of plastics, including our polyester clothes, are produced from chemicals derived from oil, natural gas and coal, all of which are dirty, non-renewable resources. If trends continue, by 2050 the plastic industry could account for 20% of the world's oil consumption.
163 2018-08-13 23:41:21 One reason is Rick Scott. The other is fertilizers, which Scott is a big fan of. Pour all of that into a toxic barrage of the oil spill, in the recent. Boom. Eco System nightmare.

171 2018-08-13 23:40:37 Gee... that sounds a lot like a military junta, dude. 

Don't you know the US topples shit like that? Unless they have oil or other natural resources. Then it's fine.
172 2018-08-13 23:40:32 ENGLAND (London) makes more money exporting Scottish oil, than it does raising UK taxes.

181 2018-08-13 23:39:57 Did the oil prices drop 50% since then, maybe? Thought about that?
182 2018-08-13 23:39:57 And doctored videos don't forget, rigged online polls, defrauded each and every NLr with Boondoggle Falls, ran a deficit when oil was over $100 and left the economy in shambles after a decade of reckless overspending on one time oil revenue
183 2018-08-13 23:39:49 A GOOSE buying SEX with Nigeria oil BLOCK? That meeting can be ignored. Any party associated with OBASANJO can not be taken seriously. NO MORE OIL BLOCKS FOR SEX.
184 2018-08-13 23:39:49 Ships run on fuel oil. Your proposal sounds great! However, the surface area covered by a ship would be minute as compared to the size of oceans. It might actually work over a certain number of years with mass adoption. Give it a try!
185 2018-08-13 23:39:48 More like a brain teaser.. No logic to what you said.. If it worked that way, social services will no longer exist, when oil is no longer an energy source..

190 2018-08-13 23:39:29 3.1% growth is anemic? And funny that you mention oil prices. Because the only thing that saved the Cons from complete disaster was record high oil prices.
191 2018-08-13 23:39:20 A5: CBD oil is now legal in my state, but unfortunately I can’t try it out of fear that a trace amount of THC will show on a drug test. I work in healthcare and would lose my license and job. The tests aren’t specific to CBD oil or actually smoking/eating marijuana. #ChatMS

193 2018-08-13 23:39:11 Currently we need their oil, they put pressure on EU for letting them in.
No islamisation -> No (or much more expensive) oil.

195 2018-08-13 23:38:44 I just use the oil to repeatedly attack him till he brings the platforms up and if I get hit I grab a ring or two and keep attacking
196 2018-08-13 23:38:34 Based on recent stealth and progressive economic measures, the liberalisation and softening of controls by the #venezuela government show lack of dollars from oil revenues and a desperate search for cash which will unleash further spiral of hyperinflation in the country #oott

208 2018-08-13 23:35:48 It's a healthier alternative to smoking.
Not a HEALTHY alternative, but way less bad for you than cigarettes/conventional smoking.
It's essentially a heated oil that turns into water vapor that you inhale, usually infused with nicotine.

228 2018-08-13 23:32:18 butter has the nicest texture and nicest creamy flavor but it is also a heavy to digest oil and it costs more than veggie oil. finally coconut oil is great for baking but it tastes very strong of coconut, and cheap coconut oil has a rancid edge to it

248 2018-08-13 23:29:41 oil can have a greasier and more thin, bitter after taste, but it depends on the oil. like cheap veggie oil blends smell like paint thinner and taste like it too. 

organic safflower and canola are the most neutral tasting. olive oil tastes too fruity for me but some like it

263 2018-08-13 23:27:20 I guess you forget the debt LPC called for, the stimulus they demanded & worse, would've been a disaster - as for the economy sure it's growing as the entire world has but Canada growth has been anemic at best and recent numbers due mostly to oil price recovery, not LPC policy

278 2018-08-13 23:26:18 I have a question on CBD oil my expert friends!Do CBD oil interact with any prescription medications,specifically muscle relaxers or Opioids. Anyone have any good references I can give a medical professional?

290 2018-08-13 23:23:35 So I just found out that there's a big oil mark on my favorite "anyways ♡" sweatshirt... I've had these for ONLY DAYS and it's RUINED
291 2018-08-13 23:23:33 If you thing Virgin olive oil comes from???
292 2018-08-13 23:23:23 Start your morning with coffee with half & half with mct oil. That’s all you need til lunch. Eat an avocado or a piece of salmon for lunch. That should carry you til dinner. Just focus on good fats and youlol need less volume.
293 2018-08-13 23:23:09 But isn’t that a hedge against oil prices?
294 2018-08-13 23:22:53 d!を好きになってから初めて迎えるお盆なのだけど、終戦に至るまでの考え方や感じ方が去年とはやっぱり全然違う気がする。去年のこの頃は鈴木貫太郎なんて言われてもわからなかったくらいWW2に対して無知だったからなぁ……。
295 2018-08-13 23:22:39 Lmao tell him next time it’s almost always in the baking aisle next to the oil. I forget every time I get it! My husband has to remind me.
296 2018-08-13 23:22:36 Definitely wasn't Qantas Peter haha. That was HK airport. Our plane was parked around the back somewhere. Not a bad flight but defintely needed a serious grease and oil change in the landing gear.

299 2018-08-13 23:21:29 Y’all know that dawn commercial where they clean the duckling who was caught in an oil spill? I CRY EVERY FUCKING TIME!!!!
300 2018-08-13 23:21:20 put coconut oil and conditioner on your hair for 1 hour and 30 min- you won't regret it
301 2018-08-13 23:20:49 I think that it is pretty misleading to say that "oil is fueling" the fires.  Trump has put out enough inaccurate information on these fires.
302 2018-08-13 23:20:47 They catch on fire to and it still take grease and oil to keep them turning
303 2018-08-13 23:20:40 That I don't know OTTOMH. But yes best choice is little oil.
304 2018-08-13 23:20:34 do you have plans to stop using palm oil? i stopped buying nutella last year because of it.
305 2018-08-13 23:20:30 So who's burning the midnight oil with me tonight? Apart from Jack Henry of course who's busy eating as normal lol
306 2018-08-13 23:20:14 @JoeGiglioSports Hey Joe.  I agree Phils are at a crossroads.  In my opinion, the key to the season is Ramos.  Alfaro and Knapp are leaking oil right now.  If Ramos can stabilize the pitching and add offense then we can make the playoffs.
307 2018-08-13 23:20:12 Noooo!!!!!  There are natural ways to do this, that are inexpensive, have no side effects, and don't need any medical intervention!  Coconut oil, vitamin D oil, Vitamin E oil, and evening primrose oil, all mixed together, then a small amount applied with a vaginal applicator!

309 2018-08-13 23:19:50 I’ve had such a long day. Went to the dmv, post office, library, Wal-Mart, three different places for an oil change and the car wash. 

And I still haven’t had any food.
310 2018-08-13 23:19:48 I only like fresh rose infused sun charged water in my oil diffuser now . New bougie aromatherapy levels unlocked .
311 2018-08-13 23:19:42 Stop taking selfies and start building refineries and more pipelines.   Stop buying foreign oil.   Support Canadians.

316 2018-08-13 23:18:55 I’m so fucking mad! I was just loving Oil wife life’s videos. Went to see another and she’s gone! WTF? I guess TT and her had a tiff and evil ass bitch went to far. We need to find a way to rid this community of her.
317 2018-08-13 23:18:49 So u make a car to help our oil addicted civilization and then sell it to some petty thugs enriched by that same addiction? If thats the case ill never touch one of your cars @elonmusk
318 2018-08-13 23:18:27 Isn't Avocado oil higher in Omega 3 levels than Olive oil and thus actually a little better for us all? But I don't eat oil anyway, I eat real food and use the Avocado sparingly for cooking.
319 2018-08-13 23:18:19 I don't view it as more dangerous than alcohol, probably much less overall. I don;t consider it "safe" though for everyone as with alcohol. E.g. children unless for medical reasons, among others and some concentrated forms like oil or eatables can be deadly.
320 2018-08-13 23:18:18 Ive been thinking of cbd oil. Interesting. Do you take meds too?
321 2018-08-13 23:18:14 @C60redlion I’d like to buy C60 in olive oil, and also buy the olive oil in addition separately 

Would you be willing to sell your oo separate and if so how can we work out details 
Thank you

323 2018-08-13 23:18:06 If I were to rank both former and current world leaders, Lee Kuan Yew'd top my list. With no natural gas, gold, oil, he did an extraordinary job for his beloved Singapore .

326 2018-08-13 23:17:39 Peppermint oil!
327 2018-08-13 23:17:36 Sunflower oil, grspeseed oil
328 2018-08-13 23:17:18 First of all, incarcerated cost taxpayers $50k/year.  Performing tasks for this fire does not exactly qualify them to handle urban or other fires.  I change my oil, but I'm not a mechanic.
329 2018-08-13 23:17:15 No, a deuce is 2 lines. Most of the time the oil is poured in a baby bottle to measure. A deuce is 2 of those lines on the bottle. It’s normally poured into a 20oz soda tho lol
330 2018-08-13 23:17:05 Support Canada oil and taxes for social services will decline.  Support foreign oil and taxes go up.  No brainer here!
331 2018-08-13 23:16:50 My son is a master BMW tech and has a personal E30 that he drifts! I don't know how he got the engine oil in his veins but he loves it

337 2018-08-13 23:15:30 I have not smoked any bud since I got my oil pen though. Kinda miss that
338 2018-08-13 23:15:17 These hair videos have women like “Learn how to style 5 day old hair!” 

Me: it’s been 5 days and you haven’t washed your hair? Nothing? How much do you spend on dry shampoo? Do you touch your hair at all during the week or does your scalp produce zero oil? 
339 2018-08-13 23:15:15 The GOP, the Tories, and Big Oil own this. They knew back in 1980. #ClimateChange
340 2018-08-13 23:15:08 Mine is every 7000 miles with full synthetic oil so it's good for the 7000 miles
341 2018-08-13 23:14:56 Yes, cut into thick strips, press water out with paper towel, put in oven with a little oil and slow bake it forever. Then top with sauce/spice the last 1/4 or so... super crispy, not oily, excellent. More of a technique than a recipe but its excellent, it almost puffs up.
342 2018-08-13 23:14:53 What is the total oil subsidy right now?  How many billions?
343 2018-08-13 23:14:17 ペン類は右に変えたおかげでもの書くときは苦労しないけどたぶんおたまジャバーとかはありそう、箸は左のまま
344 2018-08-13 23:14:05 Pour some oil on it.
345 2018-08-13 23:13:53 I’m tryna get some liquor and put these handcuffs and this edible massage oil to use 
346 2018-08-13 23:13:41 Also tea tree oil on the scalp helps !
347 2018-08-13 23:13:37 वाह भाई @narendramodi  मेरा 35 साल का oil&Gas फील्ड में किया काम तो पानी मे गया जब तुम्हारा Liquified Naala gas (LNG)  वाला बयान सुना degree तुम्हारे  कभी थी ही नही देश को ऐसे ही पता चलेगा
348 2018-08-13 23:13:29 It’s the right thing to do. Reward for investing into renewables while not rewarding investments into oil. Besides, they are going to be just one player wanting to participate in the future exponential growth, tencent and others will line up as well, so not exclusive.
349 2018-08-13 23:13:28 What kind of car do you have and what kind of oil were you using

354 2018-08-13 23:13:16 Coconut oil fixes allot of problems in my life I recommend it for everything
355 2018-08-13 23:13:06 i love my bffs ((oil n sweat))
356 2018-08-13 23:13:04 Salt
Onion powder 
Basil
Oregano 
Fresh garlic
Curry powder (trust me)
Olive oil
Paprika

About 2 teaspoons of each, except the curry, 1tsp. mixed them all together with the olive oil and rubbed it on the fish, baked skin side up for 20 mins. And few mins under the broiler
357 2018-08-13 23:12:56 Use like argan oil curl care conditioner from Walgreens and the oil after if u want rlly healthy soft but firm  curls
358 2018-08-13 23:12:55 coconut & peppermint oil helps a ton, when i had my head shaved awhile back it sped up getting my hair back So much
359 2018-08-13 23:12:44 I have combination skin, with emphasis on redness and oil  I’m literally prepared to rave about this cream til the end of my days, because it reduced my redness to almost NOTHING within 5 minutes... AND IT WAS SO INEXPENSIVE TOO
360 2018-08-13 23:12:43 5 years later we do not pump enough oil due to a gang of thieves that spoiled one of the largest oil industry in the world,therefore there are no $'s to help poor people and extreme poverty is worse than 20 years ago,please update your mind.
361 2018-08-13 23:12:39 The economy can crash overnight but it can take decades to come back. 9/11 happened under Bush's watch.The quest to alter oil prices crashed our economy after that.
362 2018-08-13 23:12:25 I don't know. Some people are assholes, unfortunately. On the other hand, I had a Wonder Woman shirt on while getting an oil change once and a mechanic seemed very happy "oh. Wonder Woman, right?!" We need more like him.
363 2018-08-13 23:12:18 とりあえずOIL交換終わったら能登方面向かって走りま〜す

365 2018-08-13 23:12:00 Dunno if u know this but coconut oil!!! It’s great for the healing good for both your skin/your tattoo (it’s really good at stoping the tattoo from fading)
366 2018-08-13 23:11:50 Use cleansing oil.

368 2018-08-13 23:11:42 The only essential oil is the stuff in your car.
369 2018-08-13 23:11:41 Also don't think the oil majors anticipated the success of shale, so at time Iraq looked more alluring.
370 2018-08-13 23:11:33 I agree!!!  100%. Canada should NEVER have to import oil
371 2018-08-13 23:11:32 Capacity to steal? What a rubbish assumption of how NIGERIANS will react to theives standing for election. ONE OF THEM giving out OUR OIL BLOCK FOR SEX. THAT'S IS DISGUSTING where children are starving. THIS is  a  party that have capacity to rape anything.
372 2018-08-13 23:11:07 Texture, mainly. If you like a moist, cake-like brownie, use oil. If you want a denser, fudge-ish-like brownie, use butter. I use butter 'cause I like a brownie with a bit of chew. If that makes sense.
373 2018-08-13 23:11:06 body oil > body spray
374 2018-08-13 23:10:53 Oil dey ur head

377 2018-08-13 23:10:10 No actually Saudi Arabia is trying to steer its economy away from oil. Tesla is a great bet at only $30 billion or so it would have to invest.
378 2018-08-13 23:10:07 My grandma made me swallow blessed oil
379 2018-08-13 23:10:01 Blablabla.. look, study the whale oil industry & how it ended. We are now at the end of the fossil fuel industry. Best embrace it. Seeing more electric cars everyday.
380 2018-08-13 23:09:49 We swam in Weymouth behind the Fore River shipyard, hard by a coal powered electrical station an oil storage depot and Proctor & Gamble plant. Amazingly commercial clam diggers harvested clams every day at low tide. Scott Pruitt would have loved the water quality.
381 2018-08-13 23:09:43 US taxpayers funded the invention of the internet N the 1st place. Internet belongs 2 the people.  Private oil monopolies in the early 20th & telecommunication monopolies n later 20th got broke up, so why the slow walk on big-tech orgs in the 21st?
382 2018-08-13 23:09:22 Maybe ask the oil industry?
383 2018-08-13 23:08:57 Oh wow!  Brings new meaning when you ask for toppings “lettuce, tomato, oil&vinegar and HERBS”
384 2018-08-13 23:08:52 They need to do bonuses like the oil companies do stock incentives... you have to stay several years to receive them.
385 2018-08-13 23:08:40 people who don’t fold their pizza are messy and are asking for sauce and oil all over their face
386 2018-08-13 23:08:21 Romesco: 1 Tin Toms / 5 Piquillo Peppers / 2 or 3 garlic cloves / big pinch of Sea Salt / Sherry Vinegar / Handful of Blanched Almonds / Stale bread & lots of your best Olive Oil. Whizz it all up to a desired consistency & Refrigerate. DONE! Also perfect with roasted Cauliflower!
387 2018-08-13 23:08:13 Depends on the brownie mix. I typically use an oil(coconut is my fave). It tastes better to me. And also, its just easier to use and mix.
388 2018-08-13 23:08:08 You’re supposed to mix in the oil.  Sprouts = eww
389 2018-08-13 23:08:07 Encourage everyone to think for themselves, learn to trust their own intuition, where God speaks to each of us... that creates a culture where snake oil salesmen find few buyers
390 2018-08-13 23:08:05 Does he really need the dirty Saudi oil money when they are killing children in Yemen? ... mmm ... I thought Elon wanted to save humanity by going to Mars!! ... disaster for Tesla brand! #tesla @elonmusk #Saudi #Yemen #ksa #SpaceX
391 2018-08-13 23:07:55 Today, Glacier National Park reached its hottest temperature ever -- 100 degrees. #Wildfires are rampant and evacuations have started. The GOP and Big Oil own this. #ClimateChange
392 2018-08-13 23:07:34 Keep up with your regular dental visits + have new dental concerns assessed but for mild tooth sensitivity, gum irritation or canker sores, clove essential oil on the site can reduce discomfort. Talk to an ND to learn if this is right for your dental concern and how to use it.
393 2018-08-13 23:07:17 I mean... We cant inconvenience the FUCKING OIL INDUSTRY, CAN WE?$?!?!?????????
394 2018-08-13 23:07:15 The Saudis could turn around and shut down Tesla to keep their oil relevant, Or raise the prices to prohibitive levels and kill sales that way.
In any case, I don't think anyone should deal with the Saudis until they clean up their human rights abuses.
395 2018-08-13 23:07:07 got my oil changed, washed my car, polished my tires, and changed my wiper blades. i feel like a new bitch in this 2004 honda civic

In for a penny...
400 2018-08-13 23:06:33 Na Coconut oil dear 
401 2018-08-13 23:06:28 Use coconut oil. It’s anti-bacterial.
402 2018-08-13 23:06:24 Hmm... I don’t think that’s oil... smells more like they hit a sewer line.
403 2018-08-13 23:06:15 Identity condiments: It's mostly soybean oil and high fructose corn syrup, but it identifies as Mayonnaise.
404 2018-08-13 23:06:12 The trick of the enemy is to attack you at your weakest moments, when you are tired , worn out , exhausted, etc . At this time anoint yourself with oil , tell the devil he is a liar . Bible says; Let the weak say I am strong , watch him flee from you .
405 2018-08-13 23:06:03 Regardless of what Trump says, Harley owners should have been tired of their oil dripping, in the shop, pieces of crap a long time ago. Get a real bike; an Indian.
406 2018-08-13 23:05:57 if you're making brownies from a mix and it says you can use either oil or butter, what the resulting difference? flavor? texture? shall i just infer from the diff between butter + oil in general, or is there a specific difference relevant to brownie mixes?
407 2018-08-13 23:05:43 And there was me blaming the oil slick on the Wood Pigeons...
408 2018-08-13 23:05:39 1.just stop and read all the shitposting in this thread:if you were a migrant would you feel invited?
2. Now think:why Africa is full of oil, cobalt (used to make smartphones), and gold but still a poor country? Bcs million of 1st world ppl invited themselves to exploit resources
409 2018-08-13 23:05:37 We do use coal and nuclear power, natural gas is much cleaner then both.   It’s time people research hydraulic fracturing and really think about the economic benefits. Why buy our oil from the USA and Saudi Arabia.  In return we should take the savings and invest in clean altern
410 2018-08-13 23:05:34 You could sit a heavy bowl with about half a cup of frying oil in it with a ruler or something for them to climb up into it, they'll fall in and get slippery, even if it fills up with mice, they're too slippery to jump off of each other to get out.

413 2018-08-13 23:04:44 Blood diamonds. Aboriginals massacred and chased off. Over 300 USA bases in mineral rich Africa, USA government talking about the minerals in Afghanistan, poppy fields under US control, Mexico invaded by US and then oil taken from the land, and on and on

418 2018-08-13 23:04:27 Seriously? Obama had 2 wars in 2003. In 2016 we were engaged in 7. This is comical to blame Trump for MIC greed. Regime change for OIL and resources should be abolished.
419 2018-08-13 23:04:18 What good? Cheap oil.
420 2018-08-13 23:04:15 Im seeing the same sad dementia play out.. It comes from that "core value" from the Obummer era.. At their core between their legs is ?,  and this upside down ¿ is their oil that greases their precipitous ride down the slope into the abyss.
421 2018-08-13 23:04:07 You have to understand the polarizing effect that Jordan Peterson has on people has led to a resurgence of criticisms about Jung (and Campbell) and his work. Jung's work is discarded as woo, pseudo-science, mysticism, cultish, snake oil, etc. 2/
422 2018-08-13 23:04:02 So was this a signal to congress to eliminate subsidies to oil companies?
423 2018-08-13 23:03:43 I think they left those, and my spare oil.
424 2018-08-13 23:03:35 Oh no, it hit rock bottom long ago. Now it just struck oil.
425 2018-08-13 23:03:33 Or oil spills, pesticides
426 2018-08-13 23:03:08 Doesn’t mean it doesn’t suck. Oil is ruining our planet, yet millions of people have livings because of it. Gonna shit on them too?

428 2018-08-13 23:03:02 I am sorry upset right now. WTF. Where’s Oil Wife Life? WTH? Sometimes I just hate people so frigging much! Yes-Miss Truthfully Trisha I do-I mean you.  I won’t go to your channel b/c you won’t get 1 view from me.
429 2018-08-13 23:02:57 Peace? Are you utterly DAFT? The US is now engaging in at least 7 wars With the UK standing right along side. Regime change for OIL and RESOURCES needs to come to an END.
430 2018-08-13 23:02:52 How does anyone put oil based tan on? If I put it on the mitt, the mitt soaks the tan up, if I put it directly onto my legs it rolls off. I'm sticking with my....fat mousse.
431 2018-08-13 23:02:51 What part of #Libya r u from. R conditions as harsh there, especially food scarcity, and we've heard from other tweeps? Is any effort underway to remedy these circumstances? Oil Wealth yet people hungry? Makes no sense
432 2018-08-13 23:02:44 We made take & bake pizzas for dinner; the cheese fries had oil on them and it started dripping and smoking really bad. Plumes of smoke were pouring from the oven, and I have a splitting headache. Insensitive as always, my dad said "It's not that bad."

Me: "You're a smoker."
433 2018-08-13 23:02:42 Actually North America is using very little of Sudi oil. I think that US imports only a few percent.

435 2018-08-13 23:02:37 Here's why @elonmusk hate so much the shorts, @Tesla shorts are not your typical shorts. ICE Car Company & Oil Industry wants Tesla to die. We know, they know(shorts), this production delays, cash burn, not profitable will fade away ,it's only a matter of time & it's happening.

437 2018-08-13 23:02:28 @DrKristieLeong thoughts on CBD oil?
438 2018-08-13 23:02:18 Trump seems to believe that if a state doesn't allow fracking, its oil and gas will drain down into the Earth and be siphoned away by other states, because there are no borders underground.
439 2018-08-13 23:02:18 A driver wasn't checking their truck before leaving and their was an oil leak in the tire hub.  Going down the road it caught on fire hot enough to melt the rim and part of the trailer.

448 2018-08-13 23:01:33 ummmmm I'm thinking the US Treasury subsidizes major oil companies despite the fact they rake in billions.  Don't they qualify as energy?

453 2018-08-13 23:00:55 The Burka is sweeping the global village, necessitated by the types of behavior that are now thriving under the the global capitalist/communist breeding experiment in which oil has replaced the local economy over the last hundred years. Islam itself is only 600 years old.
454 2018-08-13 23:00:43 Interesting projections, let’s hope no black swans.  I am not sure how rising oil plays into the mix on the Canadian dollar?  I think Trudeau should turn off the oil taps to the us . Then negotiate. If that fails we can always repeat the 1812 blaze.

How sad I am
My pain that can’t be mixed

I can’t stop caring when I breathe
A lonely water child
I wanna let them know
What I’m worth Everyday
I become seasick from worrying

470 2018-08-13 22:58:57 If Exxon find oil in Pakistan Oil then China will have a close oil exporting nation for its requirement. China can import most of the oil from Pakistan & lower its dependence on Iranian Oil which is one way for by-passing Iran sanctions.

475 2018-08-13 22:58:16 I've read that Native Americans apparently did controlled fires regularly to prevent massive out of control fires where they didn't want them? Also the invasive eucalyptus in California literally explodes when hit by fire because of its oil. It's all very unfortunate.

487 2018-08-13 22:56:30 On August 2, 1990 Saddam Hussein, led Iraq in invading Kuwait over some fabricated pretense having to do with accusations that Kuwait had "stolen Iraqi Oil on the border by using "Slant Drilling". Iraq also had $14 billion in immediately due debt from their previous war/iran

490 2018-08-13 22:56:00 Fact, construction takes a long time, and also I don't contribute that many litres personally.

And I don't look down my nose at Alberta oil: I look at oil that way.
491 2018-08-13 22:55:43 So when will we see you in the Middle East protesting their blood oil production?

493 2018-08-13 22:55:28 You for add anointing oil
494 2018-08-13 22:55:27 It will be interesting to see how the largest oil seller treats a car manufacturer whose car does not use oil.
495 2018-08-13 22:55:25 Yet, somehow, the Flames have ended up ahead of the Oilers in 12 of last 14 seasons, without a first draft pick, with Oil getting 4 in 6 years, including one of the best ever, as a reward for ditching season after season. Something about glass houses seems appropriate here.
496 2018-08-13 22:55:16 Eh no oil industry here. Closest would be New Jersey. If I'm gonna get outta dodge, I'm gonna go all the way. Sure if I had to flee the country someone would pay me to build boats and check welds. I keep an eye on Iceland

505 2018-08-13 22:53:59 The top jobs states during the Obama years were states he lost.. with Texas leading the way. .he had nothing to do with it.  TX, FL, NC, Utah, Nevada all led in jobs and all low tax states. Obama stock market was carried by big oil, new drilling techiques, fracking and investment
506 2018-08-13 22:53:56 Lemme get this straight.  Saudi Fucking Arabia is funding the most successful non-petroleum-based auto company in the U.S., when they have all the oil a small nation could ever need?!

510 2018-08-13 22:53:43 *Yawn*. Your FE nonsense is getting old. Not one of your "proofs" stands up to scrutiny. Go sell snake oil to the uneducated dross, we're busy talking about real things.
511 2018-08-13 22:53:39 Maybe I’m just taking the bait, but.. Aioli is an *oil + garlic* sauce (name means literally that). While often emulsified with egg yolk like mayo, it doesn’t need to be.. But yes, another once-nuanced term that gets thrown around “upscale American eateries” with reckless abandon

526 2018-08-13 22:51:48 exactly five minutes after 5 pm, if i'm still at work, i immediately look to anyone else in the office and say in an extremely noble voice: "guess we're burning the midnight oil tonight, eh?"

528 2018-08-13 22:51:46 The difficulty is in removing the sugary glaze of "Hope and Change", "White Supremacy", "Tax Cuts for the Rich" narrative, etc from their eyes. We need clear minds and clean hearts exhibited by these great men to defeat democratic snake oil salesmen.

537 2018-08-13 22:50:18 The problem is the KDP are far too close to the Turk regime for the US's liking. And the other issue is if they favor Erbil they fear Iran will end up with more influence in Iraq. But if the US doesn't invest in Kurdistan, then they'll continue to trade oil etc with Turks.
538 2018-08-13 22:50:18 some were all empty day Jesus came and door of hope shut them all out-these cold ones best all return now get their oil in their lamps while have time i warn now--as he i testified to don't even though so wealthy smart in world wisdom-

554 2018-08-13 22:48:09 The protests erupted in the southern city of Basra, where demonstrators decried poor public services, high unemployment and chronic power shortages.
Iraq’s ongoing financial crisis, appears to have triggered protests, are high costs of perpetual conflict and falling oil revenues.

563 2018-08-13 22:46:23 That is equivalent of 25 dollars..you people are criminal and callous..wicked country..go see what other oil producing countries are doing for their citizens.God will punish you all responsible for this wicked proposal. We are watching
564 2018-08-13 22:46:20 Not until she tries to sell her snake oil of a brochure, I mean book.  What a nut case.
565 2018-08-13 22:46:08 We will accomplish all of the steps outlined above, yet don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.

569 2018-08-13 22:45:44 More oil in North Dakota perhaps. Also depends on what "somewhat rural" means. Casselton, for example, is somewhat rural but has easy access to booming Fargo.
570 2018-08-13 22:45:23 Little did she know that her first premise was absolutely correct, as Miracle Whip is a toxic byproduct of oil refineries.  Hers was a tragic wisdom.
571 2018-08-13 22:45:20 Trump's nonsensical ravings ignore the subsidies long in place for fossil fuels and that we don't take into account the costs to environment and public health.

As it is, wind and solar are competitive and one huge reason companies are moving to those over coal and oil.
572 2018-08-13 22:45:18 Let me remind you what he said 
So anyway we need to spend so much money on bikes and new rules with having oil catchers and they go put a can of oil on the track. What a disgrace to British speedway. Where does he mention in the meeting Mr dick I can see why people hate poole
573 2018-08-13 22:45:11 Car been needing a oil change for soooo long now 
574 2018-08-13 22:45:05 @celliottability Hi Christine.  Will CBD oil also be legal & available on April 17th? Folks need help and do not necessarily want to smoke.
575 2018-08-13 22:44:55 Two words about subsidies:  coal and oil
576 2018-08-13 22:44:42 I can get live in the basement of a packed Lucas Oil Stadium but not downtown across the street from my place sometimes ... 
577 2018-08-13 22:44:31 I feel like Donald got into his head somewhere that coal mines are "safe" compared to oil wells or nuclear reactors or, uh, windmills

Because they're underground, I guess?

Showing that he doesn't actually understand anything
578 2018-08-13 22:44:24 But the EPA and poisoning the planet all good?  Oh yeah big oil corps.
579 2018-08-13 22:44:10 Twitterverse, there is no vast conspiracy between climate scientists, the Deep State, the Rothschilds, George Soros and the oil companies (who now publicly admit anthropogenic global warming)! Plus, Prof Cobb is badass!
580 2018-08-13 22:43:54 So your answer is that you think politicians should be able to act in complete opposition to everything they promise? i.e, no guarantee. You do realise that people use to sell snake oil before we had consumer rights and trading standards for everything but politics.

589 2018-08-13 22:43:03 A scientist can "still" argue about man's impact on climate because this is an extremely complicated science with 1000's of variables. But "actual" impact of Oil vs EV's.... there has been multiple lifecycle studies and conclusion is pretty much unambiguous.

600 2018-08-13 22:41:18 Of course they do. Rare metal is bad for "specific" mining sites, while OIL is bad for "Site" and "atmosphere". This stuff is so well documented and researched that there should not even be a question.
601 2018-08-13 22:41:00 What? Federal government has propped up oil and gas industries for years with "corporate welfare." Consumers pay a higher price every year for fossil fuels.
602 2018-08-13 22:40:42 What happens when is oil spill in the ocean , kill fish , what happens when natural gas pipe leaks  blow up a house , what happens when coal miner got killed inside a tunnel mine

613 2018-08-13 22:39:47 it takes 1/4 tub of coconut oil and twenty minutes to moisturize my whole body and THAT is why i only do this twice a year
614 2018-08-13 22:39:31 Standard Oil had 10,000 rigs in the Ocean of Venezuela in 1933.
this isn't Science Vs. the Deniers
It's people Vs. corporations.
How do we get Oil Companies to change their ways
before it is too late?
 THAT is the question.
We can't rely on politicians to solve it.
615 2018-08-13 22:39:27 Yea. Timing is everything. I’m watching oil closely here. If it continues to slip that should weigh heavily on US GDP going forward. Thinking trade deficit will suffer as well considering China tariffs on US LNG & oil. Notice today that USD flat, long bond ylds up stocks down?

620 2018-08-13 22:38:30 Yeah, Austin's stronger now that tech > oil, but it's been adding housing for decades, even w/o Houston's ban on zoning.
621 2018-08-13 22:38:22 This just made my brain unpleasantly lock up like an engine out of oil

626 2018-08-13 22:36:56 @realDonaldTrump Saudi Arabia could easily capture Iran's oil reserves, Iran's oil exports should reach zero by November, zero, zero, zero
627 2018-08-13 22:36:56 Does that mean oil and gas subsidies are going away?
628 2018-08-13 22:36:56 Yeah it would seem to me that if you are on the right you are trying to get away from socialism not embrace it. Wonder how many ppl in Venezuela would support socialism other than govt officials that got rich off the oil?

631 2018-08-13 22:36:24 Oil gets subsides as well.
632 2018-08-13 22:35:54 Wind energy cannot survive on it's own without subsidy.  These soon-to-be ugly, bird slaughtering windmills will be on the horizon forever - not like an oil derrick that is ugly but goes away in 20-40 years.  Wind projects may have a place, but not in mass producing energy.
633 2018-08-13 22:35:53 Omarosa could sell snake oil to a snake!  She’s as crooked as they come.  Must be a Lying ‘RINO’!

637 2018-08-13 22:34:53 Kyle says axing the Iran Deal proves he isnt a Russian puppet, but it actually reinforces it. Russia's economy depends on Iran's restricted oil distribution. It isn't just Israel and Saudi Arabia that dislike the Iran Deal.
638 2018-08-13 22:34:45 Scientists just don't see the bigly picture like Captain #BoneSpurs does! Scientists just don't have the same background that a business major does!

702 2018-08-13 22:27:11 Fact, u dump millions of liters of human waste in to the ocean all the while looking down ur noses at alta oil. The grown up game is now in ur court
703 2018-08-13 22:26:56 Great news for #RMP, pre drill target of 14p & oil find then we are looking at minimum 50p!! Current sp : 2.7p
704 2018-08-13 22:26:45 How my coconut oil go finish without my permission ?
705 2018-08-13 22:26:44 aloe vera trumps coconut oil any day!!!
706 2018-08-13 22:26:34 Yes, legal Barbie was an oil rights lawyer for the UN in East Timor, followed by practice at one of Canada's Seven Sisters law firms. She now leads an NGO which has refocused on native reconciliation and social justice. Several of her previous corporate associates are too close!
707 2018-08-13 22:26:22 Baby oil and a little scrubbing works for me
708 2018-08-13 22:26:17 and he would give you the blood from his veins, but you run on oil
709 2018-08-13 22:25:59 Saudi Arabia sells oil. The US sells weapons.  very sad.
710 2018-08-13 22:25:55 Where is this place? I need an oil change in my car too.
711 2018-08-13 22:25:49 What do you consider as good foreign affairs?  Illegal wars for Oil?
712 2018-08-13 22:25:43 My hair has been moist for days  thank you Shea moisture and oil
713 2018-08-13 22:25:36 its 3am. im laying in my bed, fast asleep. i wake up with a jolt. theres a small pin-like pain in my leg. its the hot oil from my perogies. it haunts me.
714 2018-08-13 22:25:24 it truly isn’t a joke. thank you  my friend has talked wonders about that oil.
715 2018-08-13 22:25:23 Q3. I always try to make sure I’m super hydrated before any big event & have eaten. I pre-medicate w/some ibuprofen before leaving & have my rescue/abortive meds in my bag. I have a migraine oil in a small rollerball that I take everywhere with me & comfy shoes are a must!
716 2018-08-13 22:25:20 Trump/Miller immigration policy is thus:  Whites are ok, especially European whites.  Pretty Asian girls are also welcome.  No Mexicans, no blacks, no Muslims, unless you are oil rich and doing business with Trumps.
717 2018-08-13 22:24:58 #tytlive big oil gives dems money not for compliance because it guarantees more dem losses. it shows us that they are a bunch of hypocrites
718 2018-08-13 22:24:51 Talking Currency Manipulation of Turkeys’ Central Bank; why’s US$ not falling considering U$A are in debt to tune of 21 Long Count Trillion ? Why do Nations with no #IMF Debt, Oil, & their own Central Bank, get bombed by NATO ?  #breakfastnews why’s Independence now Terrorism ?!
719 2018-08-13 22:24:44 But won't build a pipeline for ethical oil...
720 2018-08-13 22:24:26 China EV adoption seems diff. vs Denmark (high EV), where it’s a combo of consumer virtue and greenwashing oil $. 

China = policy driven, w/focus on acute pollution issues (climate change is distant). Less-developed consumer culture still focused on status over virtue.
721 2018-08-13 22:24:22 Disappointed with my @vauxhall #Zafira #tourer repair of £400! for an oil change and brake cable replacement at @frfmotors due to #DPF filter after Regen by @TheRAC_UK. Toasted the cables! Poor design. Will I buy @vauxhall again? Don't think so 
722 2018-08-13 22:24:08 #tytlive The Oil and Gas companies kinda remind me of the mean girl of politics.
  Yes, they're popular.
  Yes, they're influential.
But their slowly killing our environment, our people and our governments.
723 2018-08-13 22:24:06 It's all centred around oil wells, fracking wells - one of which is over 2 miles deep - & there's a pipeline as well. Only thing I have to compare it to is the swarm at Yellowstone last year & you sort of expect that from a supervolcano!
724 2018-08-13 22:24:04 Jack oan crunchy is better! Dress it with some olive oil ,salt n pepper & lemon
725 2018-08-13 22:24:01 Went to get an oil change today and forgot they vacuum out your car... jiffy lube employee was like mam, what’s with the funnel you got in there??? And if you know me.... you know what funnel he was talking about 
726 2018-08-13 22:23:51 She had Buffalo Mozzarella and Prach salad to start, Grilled Salmon and asparagus with Watercress sauce and Olive Oil Mash then Lemon Meringue Baked Alaska to finish
727 2018-08-13 22:23:51 Why then, are so many groups now pounding on “corporate” subsidies while denying that Oil/Gas subsidies even exist? Why r we giving breaks 2 them, when they give none in return to US consumers?
728 2018-08-13 22:23:50 That was the most lovely animation to address the palm oil crisis .  thank you
729 2018-08-13 22:23:41 Neem oil
730 2018-08-13 22:23:22 No coconut oil?
731 2018-08-13 22:23:11 what will future generations say about The Oil Age? 
#TYTLive
732 2018-08-13 22:23:09 Virgin coconut oil helped when medication did nothing for my acute tonsillitis.  I now use it as a remedy for all throat problems.  You can also add honey and lemon
733 2018-08-13 22:23:07 Phew!! So glad to hear that. What products can you swear by apart from their hair oil.
734 2018-08-13 22:22:09 Are the women allowed to drive, vote, go to football matches or anywhere without their husbands permission? The sooner we can become none reliant on oil, the sooner we can get away from these backward Stone Age fuck whitts, do you honestly believe that anyone will believe this bs
735 2018-08-13 22:21:56 since I swapped conditioner for coconut oil my curls are magical
736 2018-08-13 22:21:32 I been getting an oil change for almost 2 hours and i had an appointment wtf...i hate cars 
737 2018-08-13 22:21:28 The Camaro is fun and beautiful until it’s time for an oil change
738 2018-08-13 22:21:07 I deserve a Lexus truck or something with free gas & oil changes for the rest of my life lmao
739 2018-08-13 22:21:06 The fucking rat is destroying a country that not many year ago was quite affluent and rich and with plenty of oil and gaz.
740 2018-08-13 22:20:55 You know those futuristic style posters that get made for big sovereign wealth fund projects? I’m wondering if Musk’s ventures are all built to look good on one of those posters: electric cars, solar roofs, underground hyperloops, and rockets to mars once all the oil is gone.
741 2018-08-13 22:20:41 the effervescence of peanut oil is upon us.
742 2018-08-13 22:20:27 I agree. They have shady track record with Oil and it being the foundation of their wealth. The fact that their culture is solely on oil.. and notice that they want to “diversify” away from Oil. The moment that stock goes up on Oil, they will flake on solar and Tesla.
743 2018-08-13 22:20:23 Now gone and eat your freeze dried sunflower oil fried canola leaf cubed steak and eucalyptus gravy..........

Face ass
744 2018-08-13 22:20:16 Why? Because middle east countries want to be in control in europe before their income from oil and gas stoppes.... Thats why.
745 2018-08-13 22:20:13 Can you suggest me any metal or oil to go long or short
746 2018-08-13 22:20:09 Some overpaid consultant really earned their money for the BS statement about the Democrats loving oil workers. #TYTLive
747 2018-08-13 22:20:08 He already does. It’s called the snake oil he sells all day. Why, have you bought his boner-pills?
748 2018-08-13 22:20:06 OPEC on Monday forecast lower demand for its crude in 2019 as rivals pump more-top oil exporter Saudi Arabia, eager to avoid a return of oversupply,had already cut production.
749 2018-08-13 22:19:50 Lately I’ve been adding truffle oil to everything I eat. 

Don’t @ me.
750 2018-08-13 22:19:49 Yes. But it’s probably never going to be cheap as drilling. If oil demand takes a dive, probably decades away, #shaleoil is bust.

752 2018-08-13 22:19:32 IIRC sesame has lower smoke point than peanut. Usually just used for flavoring. Goes rancid pretty easily. We used it a lot in Asian cooking. Hard to beat Avo, SP is over 500. Extra light olive oil is fairly high, too.
753 2018-08-13 22:19:24 @69Essy Seen you have a link for CBD oil. I suffer from really shitty gout and all the conventional treatments haven’t worked that well. Would it help at all do you know? Thanks in advance.
754 2018-08-13 22:19:20 Thank you! It seems like peppermint oil might be the one...which I'm not mad at. I love the smell of peppermint. But I'd use just about anything to get rid of these mutant spiders 
755 2018-08-13 22:19:15 après que ça soit ma crème ou bi oil tu en mets sur tout le visage non ? pas que sur le bouton c’est comme une crème hydratante donc tu en mets tout les jours partout (enfin pour celle que je t’ai dis)
756 2018-08-13 22:19:12 Was gonna change my oil myself and then realized how hot it was so I’ll spend the extra money 
757 2018-08-13 22:19:04 Witch hazel breaks me out sadly, I have combo / oily skin. My skin works best with benzoyl peroxide and doesn’t like witch hazel or tea tree oil etc....you might be like me if the rose hip didn’t help
758 2018-08-13 22:19:03 Gunna do my oil change 
759 2018-08-13 22:19:02 馬油を英訳すると…うーむ(中の人の英語力の限界)
760 2018-08-13 22:19:02 Same thing happened with my old car last year, the day before move in there was an oil leak and I burnt the motor RIP
761 2018-08-13 22:18:55 About 9% of our oil comes from Saudi Arabia, most of our imports come from Canada. Most likely I am supporting Canada since I live in the Northeast.
762 2018-08-13 22:18:54 eight cups of salty duck detergents

763 2018-08-13 22:18:51 Not
764 2018-08-13 22:18:47 As for credible, the pipeline is for offshore sales, it’s not promoting more oil use in our region. $10 billion is not going to be spent on walking, or cycling. Electric rail is not feasible for the vast distances in Canada.
765 2018-08-13 22:18:44 Also told @EPAAWheeler walked by Pruitt’s comments that feds can legally lift E15 ban. Says any move has to include big oil sign off to avoid legal challenge.
766 2018-08-13 22:18:41 Nigga gotta listen to why your essential oil infused skin exfoliation cost $200 and we need to support each other more.
767 2018-08-13 22:18:38 A fair point, although it won’t help if European oil importers decide to bail on Iran for their own reasons — which is basically a sure thing
768 2018-08-13 22:18:28 Now playing I Need Your Oil by E. Dewey Smith, Jr. & The House of Hope Atlanta!
769 2018-08-13 22:18:15 No collusion, just conspiracy with Russia and other bad actors to defraud the United States....your just a snack oil salesman selling lies and poison in the Twittersphere!
770 2018-08-13 22:17:51 I just got my car inspected and spent $1500. This did include 4 new runflat tires, the inspection, oil change and a complete detail/wax. Being boujie and driving a Benz will be the death of me some day.
771 2018-08-13 22:17:38 CBD oil
772 2018-08-13 22:17:09 So my coconut oil has finally become solid again... it’s no longer summer for me 
773 2018-08-13 22:17:06 Candle, pillow spray, or a acouple drops of levnder oil on your face and forehead. I feel like a مشعوذة but people say it works
774 2018-08-13 22:17:01 Olive oil is a good alternative for the bacon drippings.
775 2018-08-13 22:16:57 It’s called dabur amla oil THE SMELL I CAN’T you know when you around something strong and it won’t go away or it’s on you and you have that nauseous feeling
776 2018-08-13 22:16:39 What a shitheel, smarmy snake oil salesman.
777 2018-08-13 22:16:34 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?
778 2018-08-13 22:16:31 Without money oil has no voice. That would infringe on oils right to free speech. That would be unAmerican.  #tytlive

781 2018-08-13 22:16:11 I truly do not understand how they screwed up the oil if it was the only thing they cared about
782 2018-08-13 22:16:07 Maracuja oil i still need to try it I’ve been eyeing it for sometime
783 2018-08-13 22:15:58 Check your Engine oil today.
784 2018-08-13 22:15:51 I spoke to an oil industry geo-physicist over the weekend who was concerned about fracking because the chemicals which are pumped down to release the hydo-carbons are toxic and the substrata is full of fissures which can leach the chemicals (and hydro-carbons) into water supplies
785 2018-08-13 22:15:49 Coconut oil making my skin glow 
786 2018-08-13 22:15:48 @StPaulResident getting the oil changed in my car tomorrow. I’ll check in with updates.
787 2018-08-13 22:15:35 Changed that oil today 
788 2018-08-13 22:15:33 Never a good idea to get hot oil in your eye
789 2018-08-13 22:15:32 In your opinion. Model X is already a 4 x 4 electric SUV & selling fast. New Jaguar I-Pace already established as a good off road 4 x 4. Plenty more like that to come. Electric perform better in extreme cold because they never fail to start, no anti-freeze needed, no oil either.
790 2018-08-13 22:15:30 My hands are so cold and I walk so much today  online at 10 pm!! Oil show but remember to keep me warm 
791 2018-08-13 22:15:27 I'm using coconut oil on my new tattoo because the ointment I ordered arrives tomorrow

And I smell LOVELY

Come get me, boys. I'm all buttered up
792 2018-08-13 22:15:24 @DevinNunes @Mov5Stelle @matteosalvinimi @PutinRF_Eng @realDonaldTrump Complete nonsense - efforts by U.S. politicians to blame environmental opposition to tearing up our whole country for oil drilling and having gas pipelines end at pristine Italian beaches as Russia-backed.
793 2018-08-13 22:14:51 It’s is shocking how many snake oil salesmen there are in the space. Out of ignorance, I followed 1 for way too long to begin with. He ended up margin trading people’s mutual funds away to 0, after failing in the bear market. Glad I avoided that. Now I appreciate quality follows.
794 2018-08-13 22:14:27 My car is getting an oil change and the limos tire popped and he won't stop sending me selfies.
795 2018-08-13 22:14:18 @FordService how long should a Ford works oil change service with an online appointment take?  I’m at the 2 hour mark now.  Seems ridiculous guys.
796 2018-08-13 22:14:16 Libs are stupid, no question about it.
797 2018-08-13 22:14:10 You must have specifics. 1 . Cap pricing on pharmaceuticals. 2. End the GOP Tax Scam Bill and let the 1% pay their fair share of the tax burden while helping the overtaxed, suffering middle class 3. Ban taking money from industries that damage our environment oil, gas, coal
798 2018-08-13 22:14:08 3.9 mil new jobs, Lowest unemployment rate in 45 years for women, Blacks, Hispanics. Vets.  Debt moving down, Our Vets are being taken care of they go where they need to & the VA pays for it. Export of CLEAN COAL up 60% OIL & Gas up at all time high. accomplishments toolongtolist
799 2018-08-13 22:14:04 Another 2014 lie debunked ? I would be cringing if I had supported and in some cases professed  the nonsense talked about Oil at the time !
800 2018-08-13 22:13:57 Checked my oil and allat when I got back to the house and erything was straight so I was like Fvck it imma see if I can make it to the shop that put the motor in
801 2018-08-13 22:13:36 Good call Stan. I suspect this won’t be for long, one dud result and it tanks, but it may be one of a few duds potentially with a massive oil and gas find. Need some one that knows about oil and gas exploration to interpret it. Underground rock formations are unpredictable

808 2018-08-13 22:12:03 Oil and Coal get Noooooooo subsidies lol
809 2018-08-13 22:11:56 Is it weird that Devin Nunes was in Azerbaijan and the next day they signed a big oil and gas deal over the Caspian Sea with Russia? I don’t know enough to know if this is weird, but the timing alone is strange. #Azerbaijan #DevinNunes

826 2018-08-13 22:09:49 The oil market has changed a lot over the past decade. Here, for example, is the latest data on U.S. imports and exports of crude oil and petroleum products, released by the Energy Information Administration at the end of last month:

835 2018-08-13 22:07:56 As long as J'cans aspire towards car ownership & taxi driving income, oil prices will keep being a disruption in national life & peak oil will be untenable. Better to restore the railways, operate trains on wind&solar until we develop a local biodiesel to replace foreign inputs.
836 2018-08-13 22:07:54 to something more violent, or perhaps lavender oil, which insects don't like much (except bees)?
837 2018-08-13 22:07:37 A good argument can be made that extracting oil is more environmentally friendly than lithium mining

And mum is helping me with half the cost. Today they just did oil, replaced filters and fixed a leaky tire.

843 2018-08-13 22:06:30 No, it's not and likely we will never see the prosperity of the FDR era again. Everything goes out the window with the Republicans, they always destroy prosperity because they are greedy bastards, all in for themselves and big oil, big money! Rip off artists

845 2018-08-13 22:06:29 16. Pollution from coal and oil increase health care costs by trillions of dollars over time.  Pollution from coal in China kills in China and then travels to West Coast USA.  IMF Externalities: Prices Do Not Capture All Costs
846 2018-08-13 22:06:12 You think that's frightening? I was reading a French tweet today that said that, if you want to replace palm oil with other vegetable oils, it will need 4~7 times as much land under cultivation!
847 2018-08-13 22:05:55 I would bathe in eucalyptus oil if I could
848 2018-08-13 22:05:53 my mom just tried to tell me that “normal people don’t use oil blotting sheets”
849 2018-08-13 22:05:50 How’s it considered journalism for a TV news org to air Trump live w/ zero fact checking? 

Just saw him “explain”fracking in most inaccurate way possible while arguing oil doesn’t know state lines 

Truth: neither does groundwater contamination. #ProtectOurWater
850 2018-08-13 22:05:34 If only oil rich Alberta and the rest of Canada would do the same and put our dollars in to Tesla, EVs, & renewable energy sources. Instead we bought a multi-billion $$$ rusty old pipeline. Sigh.
851 2018-08-13 22:05:23 perhaps this doesn’t invalidate your interpretation but crude oil doesn’t pay dividends but it’s a real asset
852 2018-08-13 22:05:22 It is you that is “debating” with insults here. There are no good arguments for the expanded use of oil and pipelines to carry it. The $10 billion would be much better invested in clean safe transportation choices like electric rail and bus plus cycling and walking.
853 2018-08-13 22:05:19 To use the oil to break through the energy inflation ceiling and thus secure a new domestic political hegemony. Didn't work out, but they got fracking and another round of weak Dems as a consolation prize.
854 2018-08-13 22:05:09 #Hypocritical Quebec city and Vancouver Island.  Don't interfere with the marine fuel guzzling ferries or worst human rights violators' rusting oil tankers.
855 2018-08-13 22:05:01 My family has been using one since I was a child... It's the bestest popper ever. Pop with olive oil and it's still plenty healthy and the salt will stick and it will taste soooo much better.
856 2018-08-13 22:04:52 We need to cover this every day--captions running along the bottom of the screen during the cable news hours.  Think about it: we paid more attention to the BP oil spill as a nation with nightly drama of undersea photography. You all are going a great job, but this is a crisis!!
857 2018-08-13 22:04:51 Would you rather use coal? Buy our oil from over seas? We need to develop our own resources.  Invest in our country, oil and gas and infrastructure.
858 2018-08-13 22:04:42 If you don’t use coconut oil for everything you should really start because it’s amazing!!

891 2018-08-13 22:00:03 Went to jiffy lube to get my oil changed. Cashier said “that’ll be $62.00”  as I slap down my coupon I say “no it won’t” the dude didn’t even crack a smile

910 2018-08-13 21:57:09 No one, not even the Premier said fossil fuels were not important, nor did he say he was against oil. He demanded proper consultation with the province, FN's, and municipalities which could be affected by a spill. Oh and lets not forget the threat to marine life.
911 2018-08-13 21:57:02 Nice, the eggs go straight into the bowl, followed by the apple juice and water, mixing them all together now. When mixed, Hayate adds a tiny amount of oil, mixing some more.

913 2018-08-13 21:56:47 Baby oil instead of aerosol can shaving cream, minimalist kit with rubbing alcohol in the ditty bag for sanitizing the razor after use, MRE heater in the canteen cup for the luxury of a hot shave.  Having a MOS with relaxed grooming standards downrange also helps.

916 2018-08-13 21:56:35 I listen a lot, this time to a medical source/crowd who now define trudeau as an oil pimp! Quite appropriate although with my background would define him as several kinds of pimp - oil, sex, money, egomaniac kind of pimp! Any others?

924 2018-08-13 21:55:39 I think basically cold-emulsified oil and egg is what I object to. Even home made. No. If it's in things where the flavor and texture vanish, like devilled eggs or dryish tuna salad, fine.
925 2018-08-13 21:55:23 Mix the 2 and we will be cooking with peanut oil

927 2018-08-13 21:55:12 It takes time to sort these things out. Standard Oil wasn't torn down in a day
928 2018-08-13 21:55:01 Though I sort of follow oil news, I can't trade it. No clue what today's price action was. Best guess, early roll antics. Either way I trade the charts live. That's all that's real to me in trading.

935 2018-08-13 21:53:54 I've stopped eating a few products that I know contain palm oil (even if they say it's sustainably sourced). While I agree that a list would be great, the responsibility is for people to check labels on what they buy.
936 2018-08-13 21:53:49 bio oil worked for me omg but this better work too

948 2018-08-13 21:51:54 Tesla’s recent factory deal shows desire to push EV technology (likely to reduce pollution). So, yes, oil prospects look good, but Chinese authorities can also railroad EVs into the mainstream w/infra investment and incentives unlike anywhere else. Should be interesting

988 2018-08-13 21:47:19 Another family style Italian restaurant in Lincoln Park called Sam’s Maple Grove. In a wooded area near the Passaic River. Lots of cats. Lol. But the food was very good with huge portions. Great salad with chunks of Blu cheese with oil and vinegar dressing. Very reasonable.

990 2018-08-13 21:47:04 If she dont cook the rice with the olive oil in the water she aint the one
991 2018-08-13 21:47:03 haha right?! And I had to think about capitalizing "googling," but I was using it as a verb. ;) Oooh, olive oil. Good idea.
992 2018-08-13 21:46:56 If I was the Saudi's Prince I would flood Canada with Saudi oil at 1/4 of the world market price.
993 2018-08-13 21:46:55 She sells snake oil in the off season.
994 2018-08-13 21:46:52 So cali thinks a rainbow is from the sun reflecting off a puddle with oil in it 
995 2018-08-13 21:46:41 Let leftist fools frolic
996 2018-08-13 21:46:28 "nah, it'll taste horrible." She looked into her cup "like tea and coal maybe it what ever mines taste like...erm oil, metallic?" She looked off trying to figure out the answer
997 2018-08-13 21:46:25 If you don’t want to see reason, then I wish you well.
Be wary of charlatans con men, and “snake oil salesmen” who will prey on your gullibility.
998 2018-08-13 21:46:08 KeraCare oil sheen might be one of the best smells I’ve smelt in my 25 years of life
999 2018-08-13 21:46:06 TWO sets of two letters? Ok, I am officially done for the day. hahaha. I am in the same camp as you when it comes to aioli! Just garlic, a little olive oil. The end.
1000 2018-08-13 21:46:01 Y'all keep yelling at people for being "Climate Change Deniers"
but offer not solutions other than a Carbon Tax. (which isn't a solution)
and you act like getting Major Oil Corporations to change their ways
is some simple piece of cake. ADJUST YOUR STYLE. 
@coralsncaves
1001 2018-08-13 21:45:59 Agree on the job security part. Students here in Houston jump at oil companies at the career fair. And yet I hear people losing their jobs after 3-5 years and just not doing anything. I'd rather work on something I like nonstop than do a 9-5.
1002 2018-08-13 21:45:53 I can only think we are at cross purposes. My comment reflected the waste of oil revenues by UK Govt compared to similar revenue invested in infrastructure by Norway. All this pre-dates EU referendum by decades.
1003 2018-08-13 21:45:51 I fill my pens with cannabis oil and lick the side of my hand when finished writing. The more I write, the more inspiration I get. Just kidding.
1004 2018-08-13 21:45:44 lol the conflicting thing about wanting to be a geologist is debating whether or not to sell my soul and work for an oil company the rest of my life
1005 2018-08-13 21:45:38 My Nana also taught me to wash my face only once a week using a precise mix of baking soda & olive oil and rinsing with witch hazel. It probably got my skin used to being Scoured instead of washed. Maybe I'm a cast iron pan?

1007 2018-08-13 21:45:23 Love @boxycharm, and I’m excited to try this cuticle oil! 
1008 2018-08-13 21:45:05 Canadians are terribly smug and that can upset people and sometimes you pay the price. On the other hand good riddance to KSA, the ‘friend’ that everyone tolerates because of their money. If it wasn’t for oil they would be throwing camel shit at each other in the desert.
1009 2018-08-13 21:44:54 MSCI August review: Motor Oil is being added on MSCI Standard Greece. FF Group was already deleted in the MSCI May review ...so I don't know why mention it twice...#MSCI
1010 2018-08-13 21:44:48 Too expensive when oil prices are high?   Most likely the price tag would hit FFP.  Which regardless, its good for us.   Boateng another year is cool with me.  Sule will get plenty of starting chances.
1011 2018-08-13 21:44:39 I do mine with avocado oil
1012 2018-08-13 21:44:35 Ladies.... don’t put peppermint essential oil in your bath water.... it burns....
1013 2018-08-13 21:44:23 Now we will hear from the liberals who are unable to answer one simple question for me. The question is; the earth has had at least five ice ages. What happened to them? As all disappeared thousands of years before man-made pollution or oil companies.
1014 2018-08-13 21:44:10 I doubt there is one at this point. Scary to think what would happen if oil goes lower. Seems investors are running for the exit. Sub 8 I guess at this point.
1015 2018-08-13 21:43:43 Republicans and Trump had nothing to do with the DNC banning oil lobbying money and then changing their minds two months later. And apparently neither did Bernie. I wish you would work as hard to think for yourself as you do to argue with me despite logic.
1016 2018-08-13 21:43:39 just to clarify im not saying Obama doesnt deserve any credit for that but mainly when i remember correctly the fracking boom was caused by oil prices that where exetremly high.
1017 2018-08-13 21:43:37 I have been known to make hummus that was 100% chickpea with just a bit of sesame oil instead of tahini.
1018 2018-08-13 21:43:35 Yes, it does seem there are fewer people these days that want a proper funded NHS, better public transport, the super wealthy to pay their taxes, less oil and profit wars, better environmental protections and a more fair society.
1019 2018-08-13 21:43:16 Seeing what Qatar and Saudi Arabia are doing with their oil money makes with wonder if Nigeria is selling coconut oil!?
1020 2018-08-13 21:43:12 You just wanna rip your own head off right? The worst. Yeah try the peppermint oil for sure!!! If you need anything lemme know.
1021 2018-08-13 21:43:01 These panelists making excuses for the govt...in my books governments are guilty until proven innocent... countries are not run on goodwill engine oil. It's run on  management systems that are prudent and realistic.
1022 2018-08-13 21:42:46 How Nigeria has so much oil and yet they have power cuts lasting hours or even days?

Lawd money really the root of most evil.
1023 2018-08-13 21:42:36 oil painting has to be the most patient things ever. mad respect to anyone that can sit down and have an understanding of a medium such as that!
1024 2018-08-13 21:42:33 Use CBD Oil to help prevent a recurrence!
1025 2018-08-13 21:42:23 200 million from oil Annie , at that rate it would take 65 years to make up the 13,000 million pounds we received from Barnett this year ,  maybe some day the SNP will put something into the pot for a change . Pooling and sharing   in the UK
1026 2018-08-13 21:42:19 Yeah I'm popping pills (omega 3 fish oil tablets)
1027 2018-08-13 21:41:59 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. New York City sleeps.
1028 2018-08-13 21:41:59 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1029 2018-08-13 21:41:55 ...great weekend of leadership empowerment for an Oil & Gas Company in Koko, Delta State.

1031 2018-08-13 21:41:46 I ate tinga for the first time today and it was made with THC oil 
1032 2018-08-13 21:41:44 I hadn't even heard of palm oil til a few years ago. Now it's on my check list of ingredients before I buy anything and won't buy anything with this in it. We are a disgrace to this beautiful planet. Destroying all that is good to make commercial crap we don't need
1033 2018-08-13 21:41:35 As soon as they run out of oil (or the world goes green - whichever happens first) they'll be screwed, they've got nothing to fall back on
1034 2018-08-13 21:41:35 Nah it’ll be just like your using regular baby oil you just got glitter but I bought one it’s an argon oil brand that sells body glitter also
1035 2018-08-13 21:41:35 Worked in Aberdeen for 5 yrs, then did teacher training. Amazing how visible it is to see how the oil industry distorted Shetland/Orkney’s economies
1036 2018-08-13 21:41:33 Use hair dryer 
Scalp needs oil to grow hair.
I have many solutions, you will get results!!
1037 2018-08-13 21:41:31 1) Massage your hair with oil once a week 
2) Hair masks 
3) Don’t wash your hair more than once a week 
4) Use scrunches to tie up your hair not other hair bands
5) Put your hair in protective hair styles at night

Hopefully this helps x
1038 2018-08-13 21:41:30 So i was at a party and people were using bacon fat to cook eggs instead of cooking oil and now the smell of bacon makes me wanna vomit cus it just looked disgusting
1039 2018-08-13 21:41:23 Snake oil salesman.
1040 2018-08-13 21:41:20 I think this is just investment for the future, they're going to sell oil for as long as possible, and when the oil no longer becomes needed, they will be glad that they invested in this early on.
1041 2018-08-13 21:41:17 Olive oil works for me 
1042 2018-08-13 21:41:17 送料200円やっぱりん？ってなってたけどやばいな、でも最後の一文は草
1043 2018-08-13 21:41:16 That truly is Amazing. Snake oil still a strong seller....
1044 2018-08-13 21:41:14 Tried to be classy tonight, with bread , cheese, oil and vinegar... and a bucket load of popcorn chicken because why not

1052 2018-08-13 21:39:58 Bruce Lee once said that every time the Donald tries to formulate a clear sentence, a tibetan monch dreams about being a #Democrat
1053 2018-08-13 21:39:54 I really hope their intentions are pure. They can make a load more money on oil than they can on electric cars (that aren’t currently turning a profit), and they know that. Otherwise it seems odd that they want to put themselves out of business.
1054 2018-08-13 21:39:49 Classses and a lot a lot a lot of practice! My mother always had a steady hand but no experience, took oil portrait classes when I was a fresh babeh and from scratch learned how to create picture like portraits. She’d spend a week on an eyeball but perfect everytime! My inspo
1055 2018-08-13 21:39:44 I signed up for classes, took care of some shit at the bank, got an oil change. My house is clean. Next is laundry and to clean my car
1056 2018-08-13 21:39:43 Depending on what kind of oil your car uses, 4-6
1057 2018-08-13 21:39:26 rose seed oil by the ordinary (any other brand works too) is amazing!
1058 2018-08-13 21:39:17 So when my country goes under, is the oil industry hiring?  Inspecting welds for cracks is something they usually need
1059 2018-08-13 21:39:09 Must be the oil 
1060 2018-08-13 21:38:53 Ur killing us with ur greed for fossil fuels & oil. DO NOT FN preach to us. Ur only intent is to make urself and ur investors richer. At our expense. Mr. Kennedy is looking out for us. U know, the American ppl.
1061 2018-08-13 21:38:52 I always told people Round-Up was dangerous. I could have saved humans Trillions just on this,Houston,Fukushima,and The Oil Spill. That is not counting my phophecy of the Challenger and The Columbia which I dreamed about and knew the fate of.. What a bunch of fools the world is!
1062 2018-08-13 21:38:46 It is clear that mr. Singh has no plan to buy Canadian oil and create jobs for Canadians.
1063 2018-08-13 21:38:33 Back when Montana Skeptic was on twitter, Ross often said that oil companies and people who invest in them were all evil and climate change was real, and he is fighting all of them to save the world.  But as of this week, he said oil companies can all be trusted now.  $TSLA
1064 2018-08-13 21:38:24 When they ask me what my favourite essential oil is.... the kind you find on .  I got nothing  (So therapeutic though, wouldn't you agree??) #momlife #momblogger
1065 2018-08-13 21:38:19 Bruh. Avacado oil jalapeño potato chips. Goodbye
1066 2018-08-13 21:38:15 My CBD oil tastes like fireball and I almost threw it up 
1067 2018-08-13 21:38:09 Trudeau and improvements are like oil and water or I should say pronouns and reality. Lol
1068 2018-08-13 21:38:00 Baby oil and highlight das it
1069 2018-08-13 21:37:52 All about getting those oil priced up, eh? An invasion of Venezuela will accomplish that and more.  Further alienating America around the world.
1070 2018-08-13 21:37:49 Because it's recycled self-help nonsense couched in a fog of archetypal Jungian bullshit.

It's pure snake oil that makes fuzzy promises for a better future.
1071 2018-08-13 21:37:49 Smoked turkey sausage cut small pieces, saute some peppers/onions and sausage in olive oil, 1 pkt Brown rice, 1 can diced tomatoes, mix all together in deep skillet, salt/pepper to taste....yummy! EASY!
1072 2018-08-13 21:37:47 DIY hair mask.

DIY hair masks help maintain healthy hair. My favourite hair mask consists of:
 - 1tbsp olive oil 
 - 2tbsp honey 
 -  1 egg
1073 2018-08-13 21:37:36 I like mayo, but they have changed the recipe from the original (which was made by accident). The original recipe only contained water, eggs and olive oil.
1074 2018-08-13 21:37:19 Phuck the House of Saud.

Canada needs neither.

1077 2018-08-13 21:36:51 Put some stuff on my face that has avocado oil in it. So I'm going to bed smelling like a millennial's wet dream.
1078 2018-08-13 21:36:46 Now that we know oil is destroying the planet, you can't call it ethical or clean.
1079 2018-08-13 21:36:27 The ice cream is cold and the oil is hot therefore the ice cream should melt
1080 2018-08-13 21:36:23 I want to know why nobody is up in arms about the high gas prices that haven't com down much, while crude oil has dropped to $66 dollars a barrel ???    But lets worry about dumb shit that isn't taking money out of my pocket !!!
1081 2018-08-13 21:36:15 On the other hand, oil executives.
1082 2018-08-13 21:36:00 Making a ramp to get on the interstate on the back side of your oil district would help traffic flow I believe instead of driving all the way back around
1083 2018-08-13 21:35:50 I did. Not me. But after my mother in law cost me my very special Love Oil from @nottinghilldady, I gave up anyway.

1086 2018-08-13 21:35:11 I keep getting calls from this same number, trying to sell me solar. They call back despite me telling them that “I’m heavily invested in oil and natural gas futures and derivatives” 
1087 2018-08-13 21:35:06 Snake oil salesmen or used cars
1088 2018-08-13 21:34:41 That's the downside of any major health discovery. Turning into a snake oil cure all does no favours.

1090 2018-08-13 21:34:14 @TheBodyShopUK hi! Is your home fragrance oil skin safe if well diluted? I'm thinking 2 parts water, 1 part baby oil and some epsom salts, and a few drops of the fragrance oil
1091 2018-08-13 21:34:13 I originally bought the cbd oil to help with migraines, which it didn't help for me personally, but man it helped me sleep harder, so I'm gonna keep buying it for that. It's crazy how much sleep affects us, and what a good sleep will do for you.

1093 2018-08-13 21:34:04 "Put coconut oil on your hair an hour before you wash it for beautifully conditioned tresses."  
Yeah...I'm loving the greasy look, post-shower. Full disclosure, I'm using an organic shampoo bar instead of regular sulfate shampoo but STILL!
1094 2018-08-13 21:34:00 I asked the vet about this niggaz obsessive shedding and basically he said there’s nothing I can do about it  I hope this fish oil work
1095 2018-08-13 21:34:00 Dead skin cells of the body can be removed by applying mixture of olive oil and salt. Replacing salt with granulated sugar can work too.
1096 2018-08-13 21:33:56 I tried CBD oil today for the pain in my right knee and hip. I used the recommended dosage. And I'll be damned, my knee doesn't hurt for the first time in a year and a half. If it keeps working throughout my use of the bottle, I'll be sold.
1097 2018-08-13 21:33:55 And never pay for an oil change 
1098 2018-08-13 21:33:45 That five minute oil place is so convenient

1105 2018-08-13 21:33:17 Does a sandwich and olive oil and lemon juice sandwich sound good?
1106 2018-08-13 21:33:14 I used to hate getting oil changes bc it was such an awkward and anxiety inducing activity but I think with my old age I’ve grown to appreciate having greasy men pamper my car and the fresh feeling of being able to drive another 5,000 Miles 
1107 2018-08-13 21:33:07 Doing it WRONG ! I used to shave w conditioner and baby oil got me a million times smoother
1108 2018-08-13 21:32:36 What I don't understand now in Nigeria is 'is it greed that is our problem or poverty?'

Because how 3 onions (#50), oil (#70) and salt (#50) can buy votes (rights) still amazes me.

1111 2018-08-13 21:32:24 How would hayden paint a demon invasion in a positive light and deflect blame from him, his company and the government?
Paint it as immigration.
How BP painted the oil spill? As a small industrial accident.
Kysthym? As a local small epidemic.
1112 2018-08-13 21:32:22 Don’t have any brush cleanser or beauty blender cleanser?

Mix equal parts olive oil & mild shampoo (baby shampoo, soap), VOILA! The cheapest and best brush shampoo I’ve ever used!

Just remember to rinse well with water 
1113 2018-08-13 21:31:59 “Islamic Immigration.” 
As they run away from the bombs dropped by who? - and also for profit weapons manufacturers killing on their sovereign land for Big Oil, resources and for profit wars only to be met with racism by people like PJW who shills for the 1%.
1114 2018-08-13 21:31:50 Really? A GoFundMe account 4 being fired? Wow! Still no level he won't sink to 2 get what he wants accomplished. Wake up people, he plotted to exonerate HRC & to unseat a duly elected POTUS, totally ignoring that the 'will of the people' did not want HRC as POTUS but DJT as POTUS
1115 2018-08-13 21:31:18 You just reminded me I had this painting prof at the U of S who showed us all his work one day it was all creepy as fuck oil paintings of the backs of women he had stalked through shady as fuck streets and taken photos of. LIKE????
1116 2018-08-13 21:31:18 @DevinNunes @MariaBartiromo @realDonaldTrump Complete nonsense. Someone needs to call BS on efforts by House GOP members to blame environmental opposition to tearing up the whole country for oil drilling and having gas pipelines end at pristine Italian beaches as Russia-backed.
1117 2018-08-13 21:31:10 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, however illegal immigration.
1118 2018-08-13 21:30:54 I hate coming to get my oil changed cause they be talking to me about all types of shit that i don’t know.

This method promotes hair growth by stimulating your scalp. 
How to: Tip your head upside down while massaging olive oil into the scalp for 3 minutes. Repeat this twice a week.

1129 2018-08-13 21:29:50 Girl if I saw that I would put it in my oil diffuser and be oensnejsjdjejdjdjdjdjdjdjrj
1130 2018-08-13 21:29:35 I used to smoke a lot but it honestly would stress me out &make me think so much more. So actually using CBD oil underneath my tongue, or eating like CBD honey or edibles. It honestly helps me so much more than THC ever has. But with everyone our bodies/minds react differently
1131 2018-08-13 21:29:16 Come get my oil changed and they wanna ask do I want other shit, uh no y’all mf’s high af give me this $39.99 oil change & I won’t be back
1132 2018-08-13 21:29:10 2018 & still relying heavily on oil. 
1133 2018-08-13 21:29:06 @KenolKobil  hello kenol kobil.congratulations for the Good performance in the 1st six months.  I'm also interested  in working for you in the business development  department  or supply chain department.  I have always wanted to work in the oil sector
1134 2018-08-13 21:28:54 You are a liar. You said Canada must find a foreign alternative oil source. You might have said Eastern Canada should get oil from Albrta instead of Saudi Arabia  by using the Canada East pipeline
1135 2018-08-13 21:28:54 It's subtle (which is why we use more than one, usually). A mid-range "herbal" presence sort of like marjoram. Or it is to rosemary as watercolor is to oil paint. A friend once asked me taste a gumbo she'd made. 1/2

Let's start simple.
How do you explain the patterns of a snowflake then? Or how about convection cells in heated oil?
1139 2018-08-13 21:28:36 not to mention his lawyers defense for him in court litterally stating  “no reasonable person would believe what he says. “ he’s a big supplement pusher, it’s pretty obvious as he spends 25% of airtime pushing that snake oil.

1146 2018-08-13 21:27:37 Anger Chimp agrees with anything the corporate conservative propaganda press says against Trudeau because @jkenney doesn't have a platform. Just a lot of complaints. Literally the only thing he will do if he has power is cater to oil companies and cut social programs.
1147 2018-08-13 21:27:32 I'd agree. Smoking gives me headaches and makes me on the paranoid side, but I just started taking 10 mg of cbd oil and I sleep so much better, which has helped my stress levels somewhat. Also, maybe getting a hobby? I knit, which helps sometimes, too.
1148 2018-08-13 21:27:25 Like oil and water.
1149 2018-08-13 21:27:03 GIRL THAT AIN’T NO DAMN ESSENTIAL OIL

1158 2018-08-13 21:26:01 Tag yourself I’m the essential oil
1159 2018-08-13 21:25:57 I really should try cbd oil to see if it calms down my anxiety. Panic attacks are still no bueno.
1160 2018-08-13 21:25:56 1/2 As someone who fought for the Labour Party for many years & stood & got elected for Labour, quite shocked what was done with the sea boundary & subsequent fiddling of Scottish oil revenues.
1161 2018-08-13 21:25:50 I chopped some cauliflower in small florets by tossing them in olive oil and a sprinkling of salt, pepper, garlic powder and paprika and roasted them at 450 degrees for 20 minutes on a baking sheet. Sauce recipe to follow!
1162 2018-08-13 21:25:42 It has been extreme for many families over the stormy times. However, we have today many interesting opportunities, if we make the right decisions. Understanding how oil impacts investments can make your own fortune.
1163 2018-08-13 21:25:42 Don't worry, I was buying as high as 9.5 CAD thinking a higher oil price was going to sort things out. Needless to say it didn't pan out.
1164 2018-08-13 21:25:30 I just cannot understand why people buy ready made mayonnaise.
An egg, some good oil, a spoon: the easiest thing to do.
And, about the article, don't say to people from Bayonne they're Gallic, they're Basque.
1165 2018-08-13 21:25:30 Because it's got most of its populace starving despite massive oil reserves? Because it's not "real" socialism? Please tell me where socialism has been a success for anyone but its elite. Who aren't supposed to exist...
1166 2018-08-13 21:25:28 On top of it all, why a is all the money on their tax break going? Their investment overseas was being planned way before tarrif thing. Something stinks here and it isn't the gear oil!
1167 2018-08-13 21:25:24 Cotton balls soaked with baby oil. They REALLY need to be saturated with the oil. Scrub and the numbers come right off!
1168 2018-08-13 21:25:23 Buhari is building a refinery in the North for oil that's in the South and cow ranches in the South for cows in the North.
1169 2018-08-13 21:24:45 I really wanted to use some body oil to really bask in this sun but last time my legs was popping like bacon.

GhC400m oil money also missing.

What at all is happening, Ghana?

1174 2018-08-13 21:24:03 I guess Star Ford Lincoln in Glendale doesn’t wash your car with an oil change... what a bummer. Every other car dealership I’ve gone to has done a car wash with service. Disappointed... I was counting on it. My car is so dirty and my time is precious right now.
1175 2018-08-13 21:24:03 Luckily we have alternatives to the DNC. Their flip flop in climate change, choice, big oil donations, purging democrats - they dont deserve a moment of our time.
1176 2018-08-13 21:24:00 Pre-intenet: peddling snake oil.  Post-internet: on line scams.
1177 2018-08-13 21:23:49 what the heck is CBD oil? Hemp oil comes from hempseed.
1178 2018-08-13 21:23:44 whhhyyyyyy do my oil changes cost 140$$$$$$$$ i’m DONE
1179 2018-08-13 21:23:34 Yes they will. New World Order is planning to reduce world population from 8 billion to 1 billion. The elite only want fit slaves to work for them & few people to consume resources such as oil & food.
1180 2018-08-13 21:23:26 I have been using fully extracted cannabis oil topically on my spine. I have scoliosis, arthritis and slipped vertebrae. It has helped me more than opioids EVER did.

1183 2018-08-13 21:22:58 I apply water first, then coconut oil and then castor oil
1184 2018-08-13 21:22:56 My skin oil is in my eyes
1185 2018-08-13 21:22:56 That is why I use CBD oil and not prescribed opioids from the VA!

1188 2018-08-13 21:22:27 Unfortunately Canada spoke out against Saudi Arabia’s obvious human rights violations towards women, gays, minorities. USA did not back Canada in this stance as oil money talks louder than C. Freeelads tweets
1189 2018-08-13 21:22:23 Getting an oil change without Amanda is boooooooooring.
1190 2018-08-13 21:22:19 The people of the United States. Like they elected a community organiser who’d never worked lines of authority in his life and whose wife was found to patient dump poor people, or a mediocre at best oil man, and so forth. 
Trump’s achievements are stellar. You play make believe.
1191 2018-08-13 21:22:10 AUGH. I don't hate arugula, but like, that's the equivalent of the truffle oil craze awhile back. Don't just put it on anything and everything

1196 2018-08-13 21:21:52 You’re really giving the south a lot. Is this why northern American, liberal states, has been far more financially stable than ANY state ( outside of MD&VA thanks to liberal DC) under the mason Dixon line? US south, and modern, is as oil and water. the A in MAGA is again

1199 2018-08-13 21:21:41 Went in for an oil change worried about whatever else they might have told me what is going on... came out paying nothing, plus a free car wash, plus news that all is pretty much still well. #grateful #humble #itsthesmallthings #thankyougod
1200 2018-08-13 21:21:38 sos i need someone to come w me to get my oil changed thats gonna understand the things they say about my car so i don’t accidentally get myself into a $300 fix of something that doesnt need to be fixed lol
1201 2018-08-13 21:21:35 This topic is very controversial. I’ve seen a lot of people do this when they’re term or have passed their due date....Castor Oil to induce labour ?
1202 2018-08-13 21:21:30 Sorry I missed it. I just now got home because I was getting my oil changed before I left my hometown and they found a problem with my truck. It was an easy and cheap fix but it took some time.

1207 2018-08-13 21:20:48 @silasdung Buhari mandated NNPC to pay the sum of N450 billion as subsidy to oil marketers without National Assembly approval.
Let him also approved Inec 142.4b for over budgeted fund
1208 2018-08-13 21:20:44 Ok, fair enough. Can you point to a Socialist system that was not defined by, and eventually taken down by, corruption, bad policy, and kleptocracy? 

Gulf states are equally dependent on oil but have not suffered the same economic calamity.
1209 2018-08-13 21:20:35 Actually.... marketing first CREATEs the problem....then says Viola! I have the solution! (Say that with your best snake oil salesman voice)
1210 2018-08-13 21:20:26 I hate paying for oil changes
1211 2018-08-13 21:20:25 right??? if I wanted healthy food I would have gone to the farmer's market, so batter it up, throw it in that oil, take my tickets, and let me have my heart attack on a plate
1212 2018-08-13 21:20:05 Waiting to get an oil change

1214 2018-08-13 21:19:57 That might be true. But they also seem to be trying diversify away from oil like crazy. As if they think it’s days are numbered. That said, they supposedly have 70 years of it left at current production rates.
1215 2018-08-13 21:19:57 If this was any other country, the US would already be gearing up to liberate Saudi Arabia's oil (I mean Yemen, they'd be gearing up to liberate Yemen)...
1216 2018-08-13 21:19:54 Like I said you are less than 10% of oil imports. That’s a drop in the bucket. We have quite a bit oil of our own. We are smaller in population but we have so much land and resources that you are not needed. Canada will be fine, I don’t care what other countries do.

1231 2018-08-13 21:18:30 I’m the only person I know who goes on a wine tasting tour and ends up spending all their money on an olive oil club membership. In my defense, it’s really good olive oil.
1232 2018-08-13 21:18:30 Try Groupon! I usually get really good oil change deals on there!

1236 2018-08-13 21:17:48 Is it bad to put the wrong kind of oil in your car? I’m gonna probably do it anyways but I wanna know what kinda damage is about to go down you know.
1237 2018-08-13 21:17:46 Hang in there. Anxiety is no joke. The more you talk about it, the better it gets and easier it is to deal with. CBD oil also worked wonders for me.

1252 2018-08-13 21:16:06 making it impossible for people with pre-existing conditions (like me) to get health insurance. Evil is selling national park land to oil and mining companies. Evil is allowing asbestos--a known carcinogen--to be used again in manufacturing. Evil is reversing endangered species
1253 2018-08-13 21:16:03 Cloves do have an anesthetic ability! Clove oil works really well with numbing the pain. Salt and warm water take away the swelling and work as antiseptic. Listen to your baba this shit works based on a personal experience 
1254 2018-08-13 21:15:58 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.
1255 2018-08-13 21:15:52 Because Shrub had Daddy issues. Well, that & oil.
1256 2018-08-13 21:15:49 Pretty proud of him. Learning about that X-trac gearbox. If I think about a gearbox or gear oil it will make me gag. For some reason I got sick of it.
1257 2018-08-13 21:15:30 My dad told me "You're hardly an oil painting"
1258 2018-08-13 21:15:22 The last point may depend on the credit cycle. E.g. tighter credit in the US is having an impact on the auto sector.

The oil may be linked to the dollar strength and the EM situation. During the Asia crisis in 1997, lower demand from EM countries pushed oil to $11 barrel
1259 2018-08-13 21:15:21 But, to deal with the other issues presented by adding oil, add very very little, on the order of drops.  Like 1 or 2 will do!

Alex Jones is a troll. He's full of bullshit, and shoots the craziest shit from the hip just to get idiots watching and buying his "Male Vitality Pills". He's a traditional snake oil salesman, but also a demagogue who incites real world violence.

1261 2018-08-13 21:15:12 The Saudis are big Energy that happens to have cheap/easy to get at oil . They also have a lot of cheap easy to get solar and wind energy which means even more money in the future.
1262 2018-08-13 21:15:11 Φτηνή εναλλακτική αντιγήρανσης το rosehip oil, γενικώς μου αρέσουν natural προϊόντα. Επίσης, το ΚΥΡΙΟΤΕΡΟ είναι οι τροφές που καταναλώνουμε. Υπάρχουν πολλές οι αυξάνουν την παραγωγή κολλαγόνου & υαλουρονικού οξέος στον οργανισμό, No.1 για την αντιγήρανση. Good luck 
1263 2018-08-13 21:14:57 Hash oil or E-Cig?? I can't like this pic till I know for sure. Hahaha!
1264 2018-08-13 21:14:13 > SCHOOL COHUNE-NUT OIL
DON'T KNOW HOW TO SCHOOL COHUNE-NUT OIL
1265 2018-08-13 21:14:11 About to redo my mani since it’s mani Monday. So happy I have the cuticle oil to really feel pampered 
1266 2018-08-13 21:14:09 Yeah. I saw that. I'm not against oil tycoons buying into green tech. But I have a problem with nations that are humanitarian nightmares investing into and benefiting from projects I want to buy.

I hope Tesla doesn't do it.
1267 2018-08-13 21:14:07 Ooooo girl been there :( For some relief get some peppermint oil on your head. It doesn’t get to the root of the problem but damn it helps.

1269 2018-08-13 21:14:00 I'm changing my trucks oil and I just dropped like half a quart on the engine. I'm gonna start it up and hope this bitch doesn't go up in flames
1270 2018-08-13 21:13:59 Essential Oils

Essential oils promote hair growth and help strengthen your hair. Coconut oil, argon oil and lavender oil are extremely beneficial for your hair, they stimulate hair follicles and increase circulation of the scalp, this encourages hair growth.
1271 2018-08-13 21:13:53 First the earth cooled. And then the dinosaurs came, but they got too big and fat, so they all died and they turned into oil. And then the Arabs came and they bought Mercedes Benzes...
1272 2018-08-13 21:13:39 So Tom Hanks was never a spaceman or the captain of an oil tanker. WTF!!
1273 2018-08-13 21:13:33 Do you remember that time in Syria where your boss sent in a couple hundred Wagner mercenaries to attack US positions so they cpuld grab an oil refinery? I do. My military turned them all into fertilizer. Lol. I love it. How about you?
1274 2018-08-13 21:13:29 >You are wrong.
No.
>You mislabel scams.
No.
>You call everything you dislike snake oil. 
Its not a matter of dislike. When you realize that everything here is just worthless digital numbers, you will understand. Stop getting attached to tickers. They are just digital numbers.
1275 2018-08-13 21:13:22 That oil thing? No go. Enjoy wunna self tho lol
1276 2018-08-13 21:13:15 antisemitic blood libels right there. isreal defends itself from savages trying to murder jews, supported by Corbyn and the guardian. innocents are also killed, like in any war, like in NATO oil wars 1000s of miles from the UK
1277 2018-08-13 21:13:09 Oil & Coal are destroying our environment. How much does that cost?
1278 2018-08-13 21:13:09 haha avocado oil it is 
1279 2018-08-13 21:13:08 10 REASONS WAILERS HATE @MBuhari

3.Fighting corruption 
4. No oil bloc for d elites

9.Loved by world leaders
10.Baba is not a thief
1280 2018-08-13 21:12:51 I absolutely love using Murphy’s oil on hardwood!
1281 2018-08-13 21:12:49 The “well oil machine” is nothing but an admin full of corrupt chaotic people, with Trump at the head of operations. @realDonaldTrump @MSNBC
1282 2018-08-13 21:12:38 Agreed Jagmeet but we need to replace foreign oil with Canadian oil.
1283 2018-08-13 21:12:38 The tea pot for pouring oil is genius I love it
1284 2018-08-13 21:12:36 and I am no longer
afraid of anything, save
the life that, here, awaits.
I don't belong to anyone.
My heart is heavy as an oil drum.
I don't want to be alone.
My heart is yellow as an ear of corn,
and I have torn my soul apart, from
pulling artlessly with fool commands.
1285 2018-08-13 21:12:16 Confession.... I always make sure @NKOTB is playing in my car when I get an oil change done. 

Hehe... i am confident they appreciate some @dannywood @DonnieWahlberg @joeymcintyre @JonathanRKnight @jordanknight in their ear holes while they work. #whistlewhileyouwork
1286 2018-08-13 21:12:13 peppermint oil is my favorite oil for my hair
1287 2018-08-13 21:12:06 Bio oil
1288 2018-08-13 21:11:39 TECHNICALLY I think you need to mix something into it to flavor it before it becomes Aioli, say...  garlic, as it literally means "garlic and oil".  But yeah.  Basically just flavored Mayo.
1289 2018-08-13 21:11:33 Right away Sir.
1290 2018-08-13 21:11:31 Right now, the answer is, give it some oil.  ;-)
1291 2018-08-13 21:11:29 Can you please explain how oil is clean & ethical? Oil will never be clean or ethical @CPC_HQ
1292 2018-08-13 21:11:24 ねまぽや
1293 2018-08-13 21:10:31 Try a light bit of vinegar on a q-tip. Cat might hate it, but more importantly the bugs will. If the vinegar doesn't work, try mineral oil. They may be persistent so try at least once or twice per day.
1294 2018-08-13 21:10:26 aw shit, oil burns are terrible!!! :(
1295 2018-08-13 21:10:23 ＢＢひでえよ…(泣
1296 2018-08-13 21:10:20 Have they spread used oil on the fields already or did they opt for diesel?
1297 2018-08-13 21:10:16 enjoy your poorly color matched bareMinerals™ snake oil.
1298 2018-08-13 21:10:07 mayonnaise is good. mix in some lemon olive oil and tarragon and you're going place, kid! there are a lot of options, when it comes to mayo.
1299 2018-08-13 21:10:05 サラダ油に流されて変わってゆく私をあなたは時々遠くで叱って。
1300 2018-08-13 21:09:55 Lol the strain or hardware product?  Very concerned for ur safety if it’s the latter. Tho... gorilla glue is a suburb adhesive for manly, dad-esque home improvement projects. Could be a nice replacement for oil cartridges
1301 2018-08-13 21:09:46 If I lose 99% of my body weight, partially reconstitute myself with coconut oil and Polo Blue After-Shave, and get some sweet aviators I could be a Krassenstein for Halloween.
1302 2018-08-13 21:09:33 My Auntie forwarded me a WhatsApp story that started with "WHO ARE YOU DECEIVING" which was the only line the notification showed until I opened the message. After oil, unnecessary stress is Nigeria's main export.
1303 2018-08-13 21:09:33 Yes, this should confirm that the “Russia interfered in the election” narrative is a media-fuelled psyop to prepare us for an oil war with Russia.
1304 2018-08-13 21:09:09 Post half gram of oil
1305 2018-08-13 21:08:45 Washing Ash hair tonight and putting coconut oil through his scalp.. gotta keep his hair right

1309 2018-08-13 21:08:15 My golly my brother has a Twitter? The frick. Waffles have oil! They are not the same!
1310 2018-08-13 21:08:05 smells like tea tree oil in my bathroom idk why
1311 2018-08-13 21:07:58 I’m launching a Olive oil and calling it Keto oil. I will sell millions. 
1312 2018-08-13 21:07:57 There's about 50 mins left before work ends. Hhhnnhgg. Gotta punch some 400 hundred batch numbers on essential oil packages I guess..
1313 2018-08-13 21:07:51 Lo real es que Pedro Carmona, tine base de operaciones en Bogotá. Que la directiva golpista de PDVSA opera con el. Y que aún son los depredadores de recursos de PDVSA .

1315 2018-08-13 21:07:41 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!
1316 2018-08-13 21:07:35 Forget crude water is soon to be the new oil and were drowning in it!
1317 2018-08-13 21:07:34 curious why dont the essential oil companies actually take a chance to make good product via /r/MLM

ok so lately ive been learning about hydrosols. some people call them 'flower water'. im not an expert or anything but what those basically are is the water thats left after …
1318 2018-08-13 21:07:29 One oil drum in millennial pink, please. -HC
1319 2018-08-13 21:07:22 #AHardLifeTruth Again ladies...take some self defense classes/hand to hand combat, etc. Learn how to change a tire & jump your car off. Get your oil changed. Know the basics abt your house- breakers, water main, and lord give me strength...but please stop whining so much!!
1320 2018-08-13 21:07:22 Crude Oil 67.41 -0.22  (-0.33%)
1321 2018-08-13 21:07:04 Elon Musk is getting oil money to make electric cars. 

Gotta give it to the Sauds, well played. 

Let's hope our real life Tony Stark is able to manage the new investors and not be a moody brat with them as well.
1322 2018-08-13 21:06:53 #bb20 lol bruh how many times has JC told the 'olive oil in her drink' story...
1323 2018-08-13 21:06:43 If you watch the whole season you will get the point!!! It's all about look at yourself  #Insatiable
1324 2018-08-13 21:06:16 Tea tree oil, palmers coconut lotion and sudocrem are my 3 holy grails
1325 2018-08-13 21:06:09 He blamed the BP Oil Spill on Bush even though it happened on #Obummer’s watch. 
I am surprised by the Country Music acts that still associate with him. I hope Alan Jackson, and The Zack Brown Band re-evaluate that relationship with him........
1326 2018-08-13 21:06:00 Rumors: It still eats to much oil. Thats why bmw replaced almost all 750i f01 4,4 pb engines during guarante and even after guar.
1327 2018-08-13 21:05:54 “Oil changed the world in the 1900s. It drove cars, it drove the whole chemical industry,” Brian Krzanich explains. “Data, I look at it as the new oil. It’s going to change most industries across the board.” #bigdata #datacentric #AI #internetofthings @intel
1328 2018-08-13 21:05:50 You are wrong. You mislabel scams. You call everything you dislike snake oil. 

For anyone who grew up online your attempts at controlling the narrative are obvious and failing.
1329 2018-08-13 21:05:44 Let’s cook too! (Lmao this time add oil Becky)
1330 2018-08-13 21:05:39 Wilted sauteed spinach. Start with hot skillet, when hot go to medium heat. Add oil and a couple handfuls of spinach. Toss for a couple seconds. Add garlic and salt to taste. When *just* wilted, remove and serve.
1331 2018-08-13 21:05:23 Goodbye Olbas Oil & Hello Klear-Vol  (Karvol back in day). 
This stuff just cleared Matthews nose and he fell straight to sleep so much easier! Fingers crossed for a good night's sleep with Karvol nearby & chest smothered in Vicks 
1332 2018-08-13 21:05:16 Hey @saxobank. Can i trade oil certificates (not cfd’s) from a uk account?  Link?

1334 2018-08-13 21:05:14 @KellyannePolls has the ability to convince herself that drinking used motor oil is actually good for you.
1335 2018-08-13 21:05:07 I will immortalise it in oil and put it in a gold frame for you so you can laugh every time you see Mico slapping some tiddies

1337 2018-08-13 21:04:46 In fairness don’t you think there is a material risk to demand wobbling given v. high oil price in local currency terms in many EM countries w/ higher fuel taxes that are unlikely to be undone?
1338 2018-08-13 21:04:31 Orzo, julienned lemon peel, pickled parsley, blistered tomato/charred eggplant, nice olive oil, chili flake
1339 2018-08-13 21:04:27 My poison oak has spread beyond my right leg. I’ve now got a rash on my left thigh, both hands, and neck. I’m thinking there’s residual oil on something in my house  #scratchfest2018
1340 2018-08-13 21:04:25 Is it me or is the government just tryna for this CBD Cannabis oil down my throat via email lol
1341 2018-08-13 21:04:22 And enjoy  what we enjoy  what pisces me off is we don't wanna even try dang oil companies  and Monsanto  just wanna continue  with status quo cause money and the GOP is like it ain't real what's  climate  change?
1342 2018-08-13 21:04:17 You did a lot of work like canceling an agreement that people trust you. If the full oil boycott is not implemented, many say the abolition of the deal has been worthless, and do not doubt that you will pay for it. But if you run it perfectly, then people will reward you.
1343 2018-08-13 21:04:17 just had an epiphany that in the future, cbd oil + cbd products are going to be the new stay-at-home mom MLM thing
1344 2018-08-13 21:04:00 No, he declared that the oil and the people belong to the government.  When political connection replaces #SupplyAndDemand, mass-poverty  [except for the elites, of course] is inevitable. #Venezuela stands as  warning what #socialism will bring. #TCoT #PJNet
1345 2018-08-13 21:03:57 when in doubt, toss with olive oil and whatever spices you feel like, roast at 400 degrees
1346 2018-08-13 21:03:46 i wish @JUULvapor would make CBD oil pods
1347 2018-08-13 21:03:43 I need a massage minus the clothes including warm oil from my temple to my toes
1348 2018-08-13 21:03:33 Interesting that the country producing a great amount of oil wants to buy a company whose products use no oil 
1349 2018-08-13 21:03:33 contessa keep going

1351 2018-08-13 21:02:36 39% a cnn accurate poll, LMAO, We have strength home & abroad we no longer are screwed financially or otherwise why you didnt Report China took tariffs off oil OR how sanctions are killing Iran's ldrshp, but why tout facts when you spew hatefully biased OPINIONS, YOUR LOSE AGAIN
1352 2018-08-13 21:02:36 まずは自分のことを第一に考えて下さいね
1353 2018-08-13 21:02:30 Some things you can use: 

- Vaseline 
- Castor oil 
- vitamin oil
- almond oil 
- aloe vera
1354 2018-08-13 21:02:12 I hit a 35ft “unbelievable” jump, @StevePeat called bullshit on em’.. I was shocked man. Nah that was the line!! @MonsterEnergy @Nike @NICKIMINAJ .. @exxonmobil -That PFPE oil works great, maybe I could race professionally with your company as a sponsor?
1355 2018-08-13 21:02:10 And rightly so. Capitalists are fighting among themselves over who to bomb next...Russia, Iran, Venezuela, China. They are fighting over oil markets and want to take out the “players” who infringe upon their profits.
1356 2018-08-13 21:01:52 The Illuminati run the world WAKE UP, IT’S BREAKFAST TIME! George Washington was a robot powered by steam! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
1357 2018-08-13 21:01:25 CBD oil for a cat with an injury - possible nerve damage, causing urinary difficulty.  HELP Cat will be euthanized.
1358 2018-08-13 21:01:17 invest in chili oil, it goes a long way for making things spicy.  Also a big bag of dried chillis are usually dirt cheap.  throw a couple in while the quinoa is cooking and just pull em out when it's done.
1359 2018-08-13 21:01:14 The korean chicken delicious bc the oil they use are different, and they are more juicy that why..
1360 2018-08-13 21:01:10 I love the people of Arizona, or don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
1361 2018-08-13 21:00:59 just looking 4 someone 2 oil my scalp
1362 2018-08-13 21:00:58 For the second session in a row the hal-orc barbarian was doused with oil and lit on fire by the rest of the party...to save him. #dnd #roll20 #Fantasy
1363 2018-08-13 21:00:41 I definitely packed six different oil blends “just in case” for a one night trip. #beprepared
1364 2018-08-13 21:00:40 That would actually make sense for them. Saudis want to diversify from their oil mining business, since the fossil powered world is dying. So they diversify into electric cars...crypto mining would be also great addition :)

1366 2018-08-13 21:00:28 I think if magic requires a personal relationship to power it can't be exploited like oil.  Like if gravity is ruled by gravity god and to make a spaceship you must pray to him, or do a quest for him, we are definitely in a fantasy and not a sci-fi universe.
1367 2018-08-13 21:00:22 Does Russia export "merchandise" to Turkey? It's just oil & gas, which is quite different (i.e. essential)
1368 2018-08-13 21:00:19 Am I going to regret using coconut oil to remove waterproof mascara? 
1369 2018-08-13 21:00:18 August 13, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1370 2018-08-13 21:00:14 Got my plated box and am supposed to fry the salmon croquettes in Canola oil. Nope. Gonna use the air fryer for that recipe.
1371 2018-08-13 21:00:13 Stop using phrases like 'Putin said he didn't do it and I believe him'. Trump's anti-Iran sanctions just resulted in an oil deal with Russia in an area disputed for decades with no firm plans ever resulting.  Hmmmm... How terrible for Russia, right?
1372 2018-08-13 21:00:10 Stepping out of a lovely shower, getting moisturized, adding lavender oil, and heading out to the living room and finding your man focused and cooking >>>>
1373 2018-08-13 21:00:10 Use celtone tissue oil. I also have them at my back just above my butt
1374 2018-08-13 21:00:09 US dollar strength could soon become an 'unbearable burden' on the oil market, analyst says
1375 2018-08-13 21:00:01 マジですか…
1376 2018-08-13 20:59:59 Ah yeah neoliberalism that went well! wealth gap sky high, oil wars that have killed millions and the replacement of elected governments power with relentless buggary from unelected corporate lobbyists. Well I guess since you got Brexit right, you have to balance it out with this
1377 2018-08-13 20:59:57 Cabinet Nominations:

Pruitt, EPA, because he hates the EPA

DeVoss, Education, because that private education money

Tillerson, State, for oil deals because oil man

Carson... HUD... wrong kind of urban, mister president...
1378 2018-08-13 20:59:49 Lavender oil. Put a few drops in a diffuser. Or just take deep breaths from the bottle. Try adaptagens like ashwaghanda
1379 2018-08-13 20:59:47 Venezuelan Oil Production is Falling Even Faster Than Expected...
1380 2018-08-13 20:59:25 If they'd discovered oil first. would  Sweden would have 'let them go' so quietly?
1381 2018-08-13 20:59:24 Hell, the US imports more oil from both Canada and Mexico than it does from Saudi Arabia.

1384 2018-08-13 20:59:04 Try putting some baby oil on it then bathe with a blue soap.

1386 2018-08-13 20:58:39 Absolutely loving this cuticle oil! Mine are so soft! Thank you!!
1387 2018-08-13 20:58:38 Cognitively damned America pushed to the curb while other nations build humanity’s healthier safer frontier. Burning gas&oil to make hothouse for our families, eliminating species by poison, habitat destruction, ruining human metabolism with unsafe unhealthy ‘food’.
1388 2018-08-13 20:58:37 whats not to love about egg yolks and oil? (Though. having mayo on burgers, fries and all of that shit is Not Ok!)
Mayo goes with tomatoes on a slice of bread.
1389 2018-08-13 20:58:17 And a 2nd OIG report...that's delicious! 
How do you like your popcorn? I like mine with Truffle Oil & lightly seasoned w/salt and pepper.
1390 2018-08-13 20:58:16 @Climatic_Issues Here's a SOLUTION 2 POLLUTION that BIG Oil Companies can't Dispute! A GREEN Version of HILLERS Hornet w/Improved LIFT! Able 2 use E.V. as a COCKPIT/POWER Supply! Taking Advantage of Auto Pilot,Comfort,GPS & Safety Features! Now,HILLERS Hornet's a GREEN Hornet lol
1391 2018-08-13 20:58:09 Umderneath is shocking, burns so much oil the owners never change the oil because every week it burns through its entire oil capacity . Could go on lol, pulled away from it in my Glanza the other day lol
1392 2018-08-13 20:58:08 AUTOMOTIVE SERVICE WORK IS A FUCKING RACKET
$425 for two tires mounted and an oil change.

fuck 
you
1393 2018-08-13 20:57:54 I wonder how many times somebody went right into holistic treatment, veganism, anointed oil and the laying of hands without missing a beat??
1394 2018-08-13 20:57:52 Trumps done more to punish Russia than Obama ever did. Obama knew, and didn’t even lift a finger. Trump has continued pushing sanctions and  strikes in Syria has even killed 200 Russian agents. He even asked that Merkel avoid buying oil of Russia.
1395 2018-08-13 20:57:51 Enjoying sitting here waiting for an oil change at dunn tire said no one ever.
1396 2018-08-13 20:57:30 I applaud Saudi Arabia in their first move towards a green future, and I hope other oil companies will follow example.

1402 2018-08-13 20:57:10 "Thirty years from now there will be a huge amount of oil - and no buyers. Oil will be left in the ground. The Stone Age came to an end, not because we had a lack of stones, and the oil age will come to an end not because we have a lack of oil."

1406 2018-08-13 20:56:41 I use ABH dipbrow and it never dries out on me and or on the brush. If it gets dry for you put few drops of your fav oil in it, make sure it’s closed tightly and always wash your brush after use so it doesn’t dry up.

1414 2018-08-13 20:55:05 Isn’t this a very positive move in that regard..? Oil money into Tesla is simply great. Apart from that, the country is clearly changing.
1415 2018-08-13 20:55:03 Whoooooo send me in oil???!!!
1416 2018-08-13 20:55:02 “'… but [this woman] she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. You did not give me a kiss, but this woman, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing my feet. You did not put oil on my head, but she has poured perfume on my feet.”

1417 2018-08-13 20:55:01 Thank God I know how to change oil
1418 2018-08-13 20:54:59 Bet you wish you had oil glands in your nappy head too?  Does your mother use your Brillo head to clean her cast iron?   Does Father’s Day get real confusing for you in the projects?  Always have to pull the race card!

Just will order a few weeks before i run out
1424 2018-08-13 20:54:17 Maxine Bernier speaks common sense on immigration. The Liberals don’t know the difference between legal & illegal immigration & NDP want to buy oil from anywhere in the world but Alberta.
1425 2018-08-13 20:53:53 i have to get an oil change and i dont want to accidentally see you
1426 2018-08-13 20:53:46 Oh OK. Let's concentrate all the oil and gas profits into the hands of just a few global corporations then.
1427 2018-08-13 20:53:41 sigh... GW dumped our money into another oil war, O "stimulus" is probably why you isn't sleeping in a dumpster ( assumption), DT tax breaks add $15 trilllion to natl debt by 2020. fk off, compared to any president in memorable history Obamers is a fkn saint

1434 2018-08-13 20:52:50 Also everyone is already investing in Saudi by just buying oil...
1435 2018-08-13 20:52:50 I did this at my local good year store and where I get my oil changed. They changed it to HLN.  They would rather have my money.
1436 2018-08-13 20:52:48 Not to brag but I've called poison control for each of my three kids: one chugged tea tree oil, one chugged nail polish remover and one ate half a bottle of Flintstones vitamins). Kid 1 also fell down a set on concrete stairs with not a scratch.

1445 2018-08-13 20:51:51 After years of republicans voting to stop things like this from happening... everyone needs to read the fine print before celebrating because like most snake oil salesmen there's always a catch and they will get the cash  payout...
1446 2018-08-13 20:51:38 @jeremymstamper No, Jeremy, it isn't Islamaphobia.  Did you happen to read the article about the Islamic terrorist on trial for mowing down those 8 people?  They don't fight for land.  They don't fight for oil.  They fight for Sharia.  
They. Want. To. Kill. Us.!

1458 2018-08-13 20:50:18 ☀︎ first, obviously, wash your face twice a day! Good face washes are oil free acne washes!

☀︎ dab some rubbing alcohol on your pimples with cotton, trust me it works so well! In two days the pimple will be nonexistent 

☀︎ Then, apply toner/rose water
1459 2018-08-13 20:50:18 187,963 as I drive towards @FOX59. See you tomorrow morning. Any good oil change places near the station? 
1460 2018-08-13 20:50:17 @Ariens hey my mower has 9 hours on it and has been leaking oil since I have got it. I can’t find where the leak is coming from. Is this covered under warranty?
1461 2018-08-13 20:50:02 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.
1462 2018-08-13 20:49:55 olive oil? Nah that was for the broccoli
1463 2018-08-13 20:49:53 Yes and no, Saudi as a nation is slowly moving towards equility, there is still a lot more to go but I hope being more connected to the economy outside of oil will make this transition faster.
1464 2018-08-13 20:49:27 But Junior continues to buy unethical oil from them.  Where's the damn pipeline with Canadian product and jobs

1467 2018-08-13 20:49:00 Don’t think it is water under the bridge they haven’t been punished for it, oil put down like that on a track will never bind material it’s in the base now
1468 2018-08-13 20:48:54 Lemme know when you do - I'm pretty sure I saw that machine propping the fire escape door open. We might need a bit of time to oil it up.
1469 2018-08-13 20:48:40 Her first flaw isn't really a flaw. Oil companies are some of the most evil corporations on the planet and have done horrifying things to our planet, whereas miracle whip has only done horrifying things to food.

1473 2018-08-13 20:47:47 I think they are not committed to Talbot next year and see this as his possible replacement.   If so, expect him to play close to half the season. Will be interesting.
1474 2018-08-13 20:47:36 Jaaa?? Heb dat van een Marokkaanse gekocht. Lash and brow growth serum obv castor oil! It better works lmaooo

1478 2018-08-13 20:47:06 You're killing the carbon tax by opposing the pipeline. Its like cigarettes, we have done a good job reducing smoking by getting more money from smokers for tobacco. We need to do the same to combat climate change. We need to get more money for oil, by building a pipeline.
1479 2018-08-13 20:46:50 I agree with the observation. It aligns to the changes the Saudi leadership (King) did earlier this year under the air of setting SA up to be a less oil dependent nation. I am sure it’s not that straightforward though...
1480 2018-08-13 20:46:47 Ok what time? Clark and i have to take our car in to get an oil change at 3:30
1481 2018-08-13 20:46:46 Oil no way, EM demand has become a big headwind there.  Although it may take a little while to fall as we're close to contract expiry.   As for gold, I'm actually a Silver guy, nonetheless the dollar will do its thing regardless

1490 2018-08-13 20:45:24 Well sorta. It’s a chemical found in the oil of citrus peels and it’s a great solvent, so it’s used in cleaning products and in medicine. It is what gives citrus their smell.

1494 2018-08-13 20:45:01 No, the "sick man of Europe" bit came after we'd joined the EC.
Although it wasn't joining the EC that caused the UK problems, that was a mixture of the oil crisis and manic union activity.
It was Thatcher who turned things around for the UK, not the EU.

1505 2018-08-13 20:43:59 In theory oil will not out, but it will be so expensive to extract or use as fuel. We currently produce 10.5 million barrel so we have 70 years. But if reduce this ‰50 we have 140 years.

1521 2018-08-13 20:41:48 Also if businesses are able to lover their cost of doing business, then that means consumer cost should also go down. When oil prices went up the excuse to raise prices was the cost of oil, but when it went down consumers still had to pay high prices for everything

1524 2018-08-13 20:41:22 At a personal level, your hatred towards the Iran regime is completely justified.
Yet it's hypocritical of you to blame others, when your own country killed millions to steal Iraq's oil; US has butchered more civilians across the globe than all the nut-job regimes combined.

1535 2018-08-13 20:40:13 My point is people need oil. Simply "using less" won't remove that need. Accordingly we move our energy in the best way possible.

Be friendly and green, spend the same amount of you would on a generator and get better solar and a few oil filters and good oil. 

Any engine with over 100 hours on it will not suffer from glazed bores.

1673 2018-08-13 20:24:21 @elonmusk loved to accuse his critics of being in bed with BIG OIL. All the while, @elonmusk has been in bed with BIG OIL for "almost two years," he says.  Shameless liar.
1674 2018-08-13 20:24:14 It’s all about our dependence on OIL. - this isn’t rocket science. They are funneling the money right into people like Eric Prince and back to Putin.

1675 2018-08-13 20:24:12 Will the $tsla commercial be funded by the big oil Saudis?
1676 2018-08-13 20:24:05 Tesla going private with any foreign investors is a risk to national security. Because less dependence on foreign oil, means we are less likely to end up in a war over oil again.
1677 2018-08-13 20:24:04 Lavender oil. It’s only thing that works for me

1684 2018-08-13 20:23:31 He looked back just seeing her sit to herself, he then shrugged and poured oil inside the heating metal pan until it started to bubble.

Once it did, he pulled out a big hylian bass and stuffed it with many other assorted meats, vegetables and spices and set it inside.

1703 2018-08-13 20:20:11 Good on you Russia. America is attempting, by interference in the ME to inflate the price of oil to satisfy the environmentally destructive frackers.

1717 2018-08-13 20:18:26 My eye test tells me my car doesn’t need oil. If only I had some actual data that could inform me of this!!
1718 2018-08-13 20:18:22 Do you have any clue what kind of materials do we need to dig from nature to produce a single oil/coal/gas/nuclear power plant?

And then they need constant fuel supply. Solar and wind doesn't.
1719 2018-08-13 20:18:08 Some days it's like swimming in oil struggling to stay afloat.
1720 2018-08-13 20:18:04 The only way to make Miracle Whip better is to put it in the trash can. My sainted aunt had two flaws: she thought the oil companies were responsible for everything evil, and she used Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise.
1721 2018-08-13 20:18:03 @simbha I don’t think so. The weak hands and buyers left for the day after oil prices scared them away. Likely recover tomorrow
1722 2018-08-13 20:18:01 have you tried CBD oil mixed with melatonin? Check out Meladol by Cibdol. I use it with very nice results. Aanrader, en legaal en natuurlijk.

1724 2018-08-13 20:17:45 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for spirulina, and put some jasmine essential oil in my diffuser.
1725 2018-08-13 20:17:43 Animal fats, primarily clarified butter (ghee) for searing. Beef tallow works too. Lard and chicken/duck fat may have high-ish n-6 content, tho... Coconut oil also good for high temp (but not as neutral in taste). Butter and olive oil work for low temp cooking.
1726 2018-08-13 20:17:41 I once completely lost it with a crop of oil seed which blocked two fields on a particularly warm day

1728 2018-08-13 20:17:30 I'll never understand the appeal of fried foods.  You take perfectly good foods with their own textures and flavors and you fry them in shit oil so they all taste like the same thing.  Y tho?

1730 2018-08-13 20:17:24 Completely agree.  We puree basil with olive oil and freeze it.  You can put it in zip-locks and make flat sheets or put dabs of it into ice cube trays.  come winter, some of this "near pesto" becomes the real thing, some becomes a light marinade, etc.

1740 2018-08-13 20:15:51 Duck fat.  

Lard.   

Coconut oil 

Olive oil for less high heat applications.  Neighbors run a local olive oil company here in AZ - so I know it’s fresh.
1741 2018-08-13 20:15:44 That statement was in the morning and before the drop in oil...So one thing has nothing to do with the other.

1805 2018-08-13 20:09:04 By the way 2006-15 Harper & Scheer & Bernier's CONS left million$ unspent not investing in newcomers/multiculturalism but these RW cultists happily threw boatloads of cash away feeding money to oil companies, to subsidize corporations moving out of Canada and promoting low wages.
1806 2018-08-13 20:09:01 Good luck! 
1807 2018-08-13 20:08:58 Jamaican Black Castor Oil and Peppermint oil. These two oils are great for hair growth. I got this from my big cousin CeCe after i did my big chop. 
1808 2018-08-13 20:08:37 Love argan oil
@abbynaverysmom @Summrluver @jenit42 @LoriLeal1 @savings417 @angie_rm22
1809 2018-08-13 20:08:16 Does anyone know the ratio of revenue share for Turkana oil between the Kenyan government and Tullow Oil?
1810 2018-08-13 20:08:15 Thanks @CassellCath interesting, they advise against Coconut Oil/butter in coffee while fasting which goes against advice in book. I'm using C8 MCT oil & or butter in coffee during this fast, even added a spoonful MCT to peppermint tea earlier to calm mild stomach ache
1811 2018-08-13 20:08:06 So anyways Saudi Arabia just said it's not going to stop delivering Oil to Canada, but here's an Idea how about Canada stop delivering Oil to Saudi Arabia in Retaliation, because if they are still delivering then who's gonna deliver to them? #ThinkAboutIt. #CanadaWins. 
1812 2018-08-13 20:08:01 It's great.  The constituent parts of the mayo - the egg and oil - separate in the cooking process so it doesn't taste like mayo at all, it just tastes awesome
1813 2018-08-13 20:07:57 Whoever thought that it was okay to make a lock for oil tanks kan fuck right off im finna drill a hole in this hoe
1814 2018-08-13 20:07:53 Don’t expect you and the sad new republicans say they were wrong  about the climate change, nor expect you to say no the the oil lobbyists!  Just stay the fuck out of California!
1815 2018-08-13 20:07:20 at this point they may as well start looking for oil while they are at it!
1816 2018-08-13 20:07:04 @DNC ~ just as it was unwise for @HillaryClinton to take sizable stipends from banks in front of the election, so it is for the party to take oil and gas money. Compromised principles lack a sense of conviction.
1817 2018-08-13 20:07:03 Got me a new beard oil and she said she gon ride it off  Lmaoo man good day

1819 2018-08-13 20:06:50 Might recheck the oil feed line again. It still boosts and doesn't hold back. Job tomorrow (Do have a new line on order to be sure)
1820 2018-08-13 20:06:36 Valerian root, and passionflower. Perhaps a sprinkling of California poppy and lavender oil.

He was a skilled potioneer, so he trusts himself with this. Concocting a potent sleeping aid, and a sedative. To combat the nightmares, and grant himself some relief.
1821 2018-08-13 20:06:33 The cons party actions show they aren't against all Canadian values of multiculturalism. As long as you're born to a royal family in the ME with plenty of oil they welcome you with open arms. Just listen to former minister Baird as he turns against his country. Max/Andy same page
1822 2018-08-13 20:06:25 Fantastic news! Congratulations! I hear CBD oil is very good - but I expect you know all about that!

1823 2018-08-13 20:06:06 At 54, I have lost hope that my husband will get any closer to being there man I married, rather than the pained and tormented man who returned from your stupid war for Iraqi oil. Please go away Mr. Rumsfeld.

1825 2018-08-13 20:06:01 these firestone mfs couldn’t get an oil change done in 9 hours bro wtf
1826 2018-08-13 20:06:01 Lot of Canadian oil was shut in at that time , no pipe
1827 2018-08-13 20:05:59 Lots of oil and nobody is eating rats.
1828 2018-08-13 20:05:50 The scary thing is there are people out there who will buy this snake oil she’s peddling. #WalkAway
1829 2018-08-13 20:05:40 Anyone else play that crazy game where you see how dangerously long you can go without getting an oil change? Yeah me too!
1830 2018-08-13 20:05:30 Seeing as autism is a neurological difference, not an illness, injury or disease there cannot be healing or recovery.

Therefore the people fundraising for research into cures, recovery & touting snake oil are guilty of fraud.

@autismspeaks @TheJennyMShow  I'm talking to you!
1831 2018-08-13 20:05:22 Bake. Always bake. Cover in olive oil to crisp the outer skin and a little paprika makes it money.
1832 2018-08-13 20:05:14 just snagged @sirkensingtons organic sunflower oil mayo on Amazon for $6.89 and if that's the only thing I accomplish today, I'm okay with that
1833 2018-08-13 20:05:09 I have baby soft hair; heres my routine:
-I only wash my roots every night. I rarely wash all my hair unles there is product
-I never blow dry; I let it air dry while I sleep
-spray in conditioner with coconut oil or I like the frizz ease one too
1834 2018-08-13 20:04:59 Y’all use cooking oil or cooking earl
1835 2018-08-13 20:04:51 (I’m over here eating this Non-GMO, Free range, Fair trade, gluten free, vegan popcorn with CBD oil, enjoying the show.)
1836 2018-08-13 20:04:40 Funny how you answer. Just like the lib / ndp switch it up. Weapons and oil are different.
1837 2018-08-13 20:04:20 Do you know if the CBD oil treats interact with the Prednisone? Maybe it doesn't matter much at this point if she feels better.
1838 2018-08-13 20:04:11 I literally just waited THREE HOURS for an oil change, that was supposed to be $69 and somehow was $80??? Never going to @NTB again. Ever.
1839 2018-08-13 20:03:54 Found out today that my mom distributes CBD oil. She officially has more street cred than I do.
1840 2018-08-13 20:03:36 Whilst simultaneously drowning everything in extra-virgin olive oil and lecturing them about childhood obesity.
1841 2018-08-13 20:03:36 Trudeau, supported by his BFF Chrystia Freeland, is fixated on getting the Nobel Peace Prize so much that he will try to intimidate the Saudis, which will only cause more damage to the Canadian economy. We are still buying Saudi oil while our oil is sitting in the ground.
1842 2018-08-13 20:03:34 So Excited - To think that you guys have shared so much amazing truths and insights about life and trading through the months and years undiluted and now  watching you guys go "offshore oil rig deep" now? That's another level. Pure gold men. I'm so excited!
1843 2018-08-13 20:03:15 Pure snake oil.  #corporatemanslaughter
1844 2018-08-13 20:03:12 Honestly, mostly cash.  Short nat'l gas, oil & QQQ at the moment.  In TLT.  Been in BZQ for several weeks (think it has more to go w/elections in the Fall)   Waiting for more DeMark 13s to hit before I short more.  Being very cautious.
1845 2018-08-13 20:03:08 $JD didn't quite print my doji, but recovered 35 at least. Also another nice day for $SPWH. $RRX shite day, traded $ATH.TO for $BNP.TO (get some nat gas exposure rather than doubling up on oil). Overall: shite day. Let's see some more frigging trade deals here.
1846 2018-08-13 20:02:57 Were their articles in the 60's that were like "Boomers Are Killing The Fish Liver Oil Industry"?
1847 2018-08-13 20:02:53 Lool were not buying your snake oil.  You do not care about anything other than globalism and the destruction of Canada.
1848 2018-08-13 20:02:52 ALSO, she states at the end that aioli is just mayo. Not true. Classic aioli is just an emulsion of oil and garlic. SOMETIME an egg is thrown in. Aioli literally means "garlic and oil." Ugh.
1849 2018-08-13 20:02:09 And they had the benefit of a very healthy oil industry for 40 years, saving and investing the wealth that it generated.  We spent ours.  So where will we get that money from precisely?
1850 2018-08-13 20:02:03 Could be oil starvation, or stuck vanes, but it sounds less severe than oil starvation. I've run a (broken) turbo with no oil and it sounded much worse than that.
1851 2018-08-13 20:01:59 China doesn't let muslims practice their religion so it makes sense that the militaristic Chinese wouldn't want to fund their enemies by buying the real dirty oil of the world - from the middle east.
1852 2018-08-13 20:01:58 erdo is a practical man who recognized the necessity of buying oil from isis if they were to be dissuaded from a rapid conquest of the Balkans
1853 2018-08-13 20:01:54 Lots of countries have oil. I prefer Newfoundland oil to western Canada oil. I dont like Alberta's attitude. Certainly dont want any pipelines.
1854 2018-08-13 20:01:41 The best birthday present would be someone detailing my car for me. It just getting the oil changed. 
1855 2018-08-13 20:01:15 Oil prices rose after USA sanctions on Iranian goods went into effect, intensifying concerns that sanctions on Iranian #Oil ,expected in Nov, could cause supply shortages

1857 2018-08-13 20:00:52 I do bulletproof coffee everyday! Coconut oil, butter (ghee is better) little vanilla stevia- blend!!!!! Sooooo yummy 
1858 2018-08-13 20:00:51 The world should boycott your products and oil until you give women equal rights and stop supporting extrrme radical islamism, the most violent, retrograde and evil religion.

1862 2018-08-13 20:00:24 It’s good news that the biggest energy producer is getting serious about renewables. Honestly I’d rather not partner with the Saudi’s because they are disgusting human rights abusers. But the “gotcha” attitude with Tesla receiving oil money is pretty dumb.

1865 2018-08-13 20:00:07 I will put coconut oil on my scalp every couple of weeks. It’s a lot better than it used to be. It was horrible for a while. If I use anything with sulfates in it, my whole scalp flakes off, I swear.
1866 2018-08-13 20:00:07 Ooo I’m bouta make a coconut rose oil moisturiZer with shimmer in it 
1867 2018-08-13 20:00:05 now i know the key to stop sinuses is to put Tiger Balm oil into your whole nose including insides and let it burn. After that you can fully enjoy life sneezing-free.

1870 2018-08-13 19:59:55 Have you been able to get c60 in olive oil from Red Lion? I always see they’re backordered 15 days
1871 2018-08-13 19:59:54 Just tried coconut oil on the sunbed instead of a tanning location. 1 it did fuck all and 2 it is very very messy! I wouldn’t advise
1872 2018-08-13 19:59:48 oil of every pearls un-insides is in a very thick english accent I love every persons insides pero me cuesta verlo la verdad
1873 2018-08-13 19:59:47 The Saudis have been diversifying from oil for a long time but there are other reasons that partnering with them might be an issue at this particular moment in history.
1874 2018-08-13 19:59:39 Grew up on Miracle Whip in Ohio. The FDA requires that anything labeled "mayonnaise" contain a minimum of 65 percent vegetable oil by weight. Miracle Whip’s exact oil content is a secret, but it is too low to meet the mayo standard.
Miracle Whip is also Kosher

1880 2018-08-13 19:59:01 in this instance it's because I used argan oil spray. I think maybe my hair became straight because haircare products started being made that were just about safe for black people to use, and suddenly I looked like I took a relaxer dip.
1881 2018-08-13 19:58:59 Charisma (Medicine) to hawk Snake Oil? Or is that too on the nose?
1882 2018-08-13 19:58:52 Yes, anecdotally, gasoline, oil, utilities all increased by 8-10%. Food too.

1898 2018-08-13 19:56:10 Miracle Whip is made from chemical by-products of emulsifying soybean oil and corn syrup. It was invented in the 1930s and is nicknamed "Nazi Mayonnaise"...ok, I made up that last bit...
1899 2018-08-13 19:56:02 I need some coconut oil
1900 2018-08-13 19:56:00 It is strange that Musk is asking for capital from Saudis who got this capital by selling oil which Musk wants to finish as his mission. So the oil people who are not interested in Tesla thriving would now be in some control of Tesla and would benefit from its success.
1901 2018-08-13 19:55:58 What oil do ya use, Crisco?

1908 2018-08-13 19:55:15 We should not be comparing the Tories or labour to a Venezuela Government. It's brought on by corruption at the highest level.

1909 2018-08-13 19:55:08 Need to see oil falling
Unrelenting pressure from USofA for lower Oil - domewhere to help us - lol

1910 2018-08-13 19:54:55 Some mental disorders are rooted in our immune system and our microbiome is responsible for so much including producing happy hormones. Consuming only mangoes or some essential oil is pseudo but there is some truth to eating right for better mental health
1911 2018-08-13 19:54:52 Not drop the ball, actually. The experiment literally has to do with dropping tiny balls of oil. 
1912 2018-08-13 19:54:51 Also end the purchase of oil from those terrorists by building a pipeline from Alberta to the east in order to bridge to this magical fuel of the future

1926 2018-08-13 19:53:00 If Saudis control electric cars, Tesla batteries, solar power costs here, it's a national security issue. If the Saudis can control the price of a lot of the solar market, they can raise the electricity costs above the costs of oil. Saudis own Port Arthur now.
1927 2018-08-13 19:52:55 Gotta add a spray of fat (oil, ghee, butter, etc) and it helps caramelize. Usually I broil in oven or even toaster oven(depending on veg) from 5-12 minutes

1942 2018-08-13 19:50:56 I was thinking avocado oil - Keith mentioned it to me once. It actually has just about the highest smoke/flash points of any plant oil making it ideal for lubricating filament for an all-metal hot end such as the MK3's. But I get a kick out of that as well.

1945 2018-08-13 19:50:42 CBD oil is fantastic for anxiety. I have no idea how I've lived this long without it!
1946 2018-08-13 19:50:41 The dirty grease and oil slick in her hair have seeped into her brain. She needs to wash that crap.

Keep this in mind

1948 2018-08-13 19:50:36 I couldn't care less where oil comes from. Venezuela good for more. Overall we need to get off oil ASAP.
1949 2018-08-13 19:50:35 "The EFTA Secretariat has identified more than 1,200 EU acts considered EEA relevant by the European Commission that have then been contested by the EEA/EFTA Member States. Examples for Norway include postal services and oil & gas...
1950 2018-08-13 19:50:14 I know it's hard to accept. I finally had to admit to myself that I need some help. Before I started cbd oil I kept to myself and didn't let anyone know what was going on. I couldn't take it anymore and I was tired of the meds not helping. So that's when I switched to CBD Oil.
1951 2018-08-13 19:50:11 Absolutely love the oil in my August box 
1952 2018-08-13 19:50:07 May your oil never run dry
1953 2018-08-13 19:50:04 US designates Iran-based Bahraini national as a global terrorist for his involvement in plot to assassinate prominent figures in Bahrain and target three oil pipelines.
1954 2018-08-13 19:50:01 It’s obvious when the rest of the #UNSC members with the exception of the #USA have been boxed in by @PR_PaulBiya on the #NewAge Oil&Gas Deal. These Rodent family championed by their biggest rat @antonioguterres  and @KarenPierceUN #France #Russia #China and #UK keep shocking us.
1955 2018-08-13 19:50:01 thank you!!! i know realistically they dont care and i doubt im the only person who goes too long before an oil change lol but im definitely having my boyfriend come w me for support lol, thank you!!!!
1956 2018-08-13 19:49:52 Ultimately, Norway has more wealth from oil and fewer people to spend it on.  That leads to happier people.
1957 2018-08-13 19:49:49 Perhaps I’m committing a regional betrayal with all my Dream Cruise talk, but my blood’s just regular blood, not oil. Maybe there’s a little oil in there, I eat a lot of fish and regulations aren’t what they used to be. But if you say V8 I’m thinking about a crisp tomato juice

1960 2018-08-13 19:49:18 Lol. It's the oil shine. To make them look nice and shiny
1961 2018-08-13 19:49:18 オイルはギトギトというイメージを拭い去ろうか。時にはサラサラし、時にはギトギト。オイルはいつだって君のそばにいるのさ。
1962 2018-08-13 19:49:18 How do you know that no oil blocks for elites? Do you have current list of oil blocks owners?
1963 2018-08-13 19:49:11 “I reckon, Mother, them boys from the city done talked to you...but did they tell you ‘bout the oil under the back forty?”

“What oil? We live in town?!”
1964 2018-08-13 19:49:09 I like $GXE, and finally getting the dip I've been waiting for. Wish I had more confidence in our government, would love to get back into some heavy oil plays like $PXX and $ATH, but like I said, as the market moves sideways, I look for dividend paying equities first.
1965 2018-08-13 19:49:00 Don't let your hair get into your face while you sleep. The oil from your hair can cause acne.
1966 2018-08-13 19:48:53 Are you brand specific? U get crazy with olive oil, siracha, etc included in it? Needs the details man
1967 2018-08-13 19:48:53 first of all, it does not "support" the KSA, and second do you actually know how much oil is imported from Saudi Arabia and where it goes. Stop the pandering @AndrewScheer
1968 2018-08-13 19:48:51 We can also reduce plastic use considerably, more sustainable farming methods (which will maintain productivity) will also reduce emissions and waste 

Just some thoughts but there is no reason why this can't be done other than the oil fueled vested interests in Governments /end
1969 2018-08-13 19:48:50 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, people are swearing at you. intelligent people produce solutions, simple people swear. you are busy applying sanctions to the countries. The high oil prices hurt your economy. you need to give your attention to oil.
1970 2018-08-13 19:48:48 I think my face loves tea tree oil  these bumps I’ve had clear up really fast.
1971 2018-08-13 19:48:42 Not even close between the oil lobby and Eco lobby. Sorry bubs.

1973 2018-08-13 19:48:30 Hi! Er, that request was from 2012... That said, Oil Review Africa and Oil Review Middle East are part of my remit these days!
1974 2018-08-13 19:48:27 I just got my August box a couple days ago, and absolutely love the cuticle oil 
1975 2018-08-13 19:48:18 So fun. Probably the team that really got me into baseball, as a 9-year-old in Natick. Greenie (7.5 WAR), Boggs (8.3), Burks, Dewey, Clemens (7.1), Hurst, Gedman, Oil Can, Lee Smith -- and Jody Reed had almost the same name as me!
1976 2018-08-13 19:48:07 New tires, new brake pads, oil change, new windshield wipers.......... I hope that’s it for now..
1977 2018-08-13 19:48:03 The real reason global warming will boost solar power has little to do with peak oil or greenhouse gases directly. It's because solar production and peak loads related to A/C use sync up almost perfectly, largely obviating storage issues.
1978 2018-08-13 19:47:57 Like oil & water 
1979 2018-08-13 19:47:55 Buying an oil video today
1980 2018-08-13 19:47:44 For those of you attending @FIRE_rope - or any full weekend of tying? 

Bring a small cloth dampened with oil in a ziploc. After each class pull your rope through it all the way from end to end, then all the way back.

It’ll oil your hands in the next class instead of drying skin
1981 2018-08-13 19:47:15 its demi-matte so i imagine it wont be the ultimate foundation for dry skin (dewy foundations work better) but if you use an oil primer as they recommend, it should go on fine!
(my fenty is terrible on dry bits of my skin if i use a smashbox oil primer, it applies perfect)
1982 2018-08-13 19:47:09 I really like this song on the radio it would be a great time for my dad to call and tell that story about my Aunt's car needing an oil change again.
1983 2018-08-13 19:47:07 Omg I’m get my oil changed and shit and this dude in the lobby has crocks on which is bad enough but then he has a minions tone that plays when he gets a text message like... awful
1984 2018-08-13 19:46:53 I only change oil
1985 2018-08-13 19:46:52 we should cut ALL our ties to the Middle East. don't care how much money or oil they throw our way.
1986 2018-08-13 19:46:48 If Saudi takes over # Tesla, they will soon bring it back to an oil/gas driven car again or have #Tesla bankrupt. Oil is the major product of Saudi Arabia so they don't want competition for that.
1987 2018-08-13 19:46:42 helped Rosneft hedge/ buildup the USD needed to cover maturing debts it couldn't refinance thanks to the US sanctions.   so think it played a role.  but agree that most oil exporters shouldn't resist letting fx fall when oil falls.
1988 2018-08-13 19:46:30 $ete $etp oil is down $.30. $USO is flat basically. this $XOP $xle sell off is unwarranted
1989 2018-08-13 19:46:26 ONGC now stands for 'Oil and Nali Gas Corporation'
1990 2018-08-13 19:46:02 Umm, it's egg and oil. What's to hate?
1991 2018-08-13 19:46:00 Oil? Gas? Hydro? Whisky? Tourism? Where the fuck do you think it all comes from?
1992 2018-08-13 19:45:59 Awesome!!!! Even MORE of our tax money can go toward killing people who stand between our government and it's oil company overlords! The hell with the water in Flint, the crumbling schools, the homeless kids....MORE WEAPONS!!!
1993 2018-08-13 19:45:58 Check your Engine oil this morning.
1994 2018-08-13 19:45:57 he is busy in selling Tesla, the company that can make world oil-free, to Saudi Arabia, the country that want to enslave everyone through oil money..
1995 2018-08-13 19:45:53 Ye olde tyme Gypsy. He'd have a gold LEAFED wagon and sell snake oil and his daughters bodies to buy stronger horses. He'd have  "Yuge", the yugest horses, and his sons would be dressed as old lady fortune tellers. Oh, and other gypsies wouldn't talk to him and call him a thief.
1996 2018-08-13 19:45:51 True and in london etc it works but until we get to 300 plus real time miles range and 5 minute recharges I cant see many fleets ditching oil
1997 2018-08-13 19:45:49 I don’t fuck with frying oil either  shit scares me a lot! Should I feel less a woman? 
1998 2018-08-13 19:45:39 Have you seen the oil price fella 
1999 2018-08-13 19:45:33 Cbd oil is doing wonders for me.
2000 2018-08-13 19:45:32 That makes sense. Both my skin and hair are naturally oily. Thanks to the climate here, my body thinks it needs to produce 3x the oil to protect itself. #writeforum
2001 2018-08-13 19:45:20 I think it’s also important to note that alot of what we saw from ‘06 to ‘11 was franchise-historic. Howard chasing Babe Ruth, J-Roll’s MVP ‘07, Series in ‘08, pennant in ‘09 and a WS vs Yankees, Doc’s 2010, 4 aces in ‘11. This is a nice team whose identity is coconut oil.
2002 2018-08-13 19:45:17 Does this one have a decent oil cooler on it?
2003 2018-08-13 19:45:17 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
2004 2018-08-13 19:45:04 Indeed I so concur! The bewitching was always in the delivery. The same way you stated with kind & supportive..While he's blasting countries & warring, children left parentless & caged, when he strips the others of their resources in the name of Gold, Oil & Drugs..He is the devil

2008 2018-08-13 19:44:52 To be fair I've not researched that side of the shield. I've mainly been focused on the lithium and cobalt blue. I need more info about myshield really. #TSI
2009 2018-08-13 19:44:45 It's this kind of @ProfOsinbajo's initiative of sharing N10k that makes me support that each region should govern themselves while contributing a quota to a central govt. 

E.g, if Osinbajo decides to share N10k in SW, that's not our problem, so long he's not using ND oil money.
2010 2018-08-13 19:44:40 @realDonaldTrump we were able to cancel the nuclear deal and return all the sanctions. Now, with a full boycott of oil, everyone will see that this regime will collapse and our people will be released.

2015 2018-08-13 19:43:49 We smell like vanilla n sweet oil sweetie
2016 2018-08-13 19:43:42 That'll help, sure!  But let's keep this in perspetive, outside the oil industry the higher wages are only really noticeable at the lower end. You can expect to earn at least £12-15 an hour for even the most basic work – double the UK's minimum wage.
2017 2018-08-13 19:43:41 CHINA HAS REMOVED ITS 25% TARIFF ON OIL

WHY ISN'T THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA TALKING ABOUT THIS? BECAUSE IT'S A BIG WIN FOR PRES TRUMP?
2018 2018-08-13 19:43:35 Do you have any clue what kind of materials do we need to dig from naturr to produce a single solar panel ?? How can industry say that we are helping nature if we need to extract more oil, cobre, gold, aluminium, etc, etc, etc <-- this is not helping nature, this is a industry .
2019 2018-08-13 19:43:32 As per the tenets of Islam, sinners would go to hell & get fried in mega pans full of hot oil in life after death. In Vishwaroopam 2, @ikamalhaasan had made the terrorist (Rahul Bose) suffer hot oil burns even in life before death. Did anyone notice that subtle message?

2022 2018-08-13 19:43:16 If Saudis will really enter in the solar market (on the long run -10yrs-  they certainly will) is because, in my opinion:
- oil >100$/barrel.
- they will get into it trough an EPC agreement with a major oil company (likely with Total, Shell or BP bc of their expertise in solar)
2023 2018-08-13 19:43:09 i put a oil stain on my favourite duvet cover i’m gonna cry
2024 2018-08-13 19:42:56 I really have no idea why oil industry want to destroy the planet because of short-term profit. Short-term what I have mentioned means few years and after that there is no way back. Support fuel cell cars!
2025 2018-08-13 19:42:34 @TomPerez hey congrats on taking a big ol' shit on the future with your resolution to suck the teat of oil money, you craven corporate whore

2030 2018-08-13 19:41:59 Backing down to a bully leads to more bullying. I fully support transitioning all foreign oil to domestic like any sane energy-wealthy country would do as a matter of course. Why does no other oil nation face this contrived opposition? Foreign money and complicit politicians.
2031 2018-08-13 19:41:58 I worked at an aveda salon through school on the front desk & completed training at AIC to be an esthetician. Sadly it didn’t work out with that spa, Love my job now just wish we used aveda! Beautifying oil was always a favorite & my skin is in desperate need of a plant peel!!!
2032 2018-08-13 19:41:49 Yes you blocked everything except oil sale cause why hurt yourself. And we really don’t care. Most Canadians would want to cut all ties with your corrupt, child killing, Country.  Keep your oil.
2033 2018-08-13 19:41:45 Does baby oil help cleaning off the skin or a hot wash rag?
2034 2018-08-13 19:41:37 Seriously considering it. Wondering if does get absorbed in cells the way in olive oil does because studies prove that in rat study Olive oil alone extends lifespan 15% by itself
2035 2018-08-13 19:41:30 So what do you have to say about Big Sugar and pollution of Florida’s waters, restoring the Everglades and banning oil drilling off the coast of Florida?? vs exploiting Parkland victim parents on Instagram. Talk real.
2036 2018-08-13 19:41:17 I watched it and it was pretty clear you said that we should look at buying oil from other countries.

2059 2018-08-13 19:38:25 You should be doing some hot oil treatments and your diet plays a role. Maybe start taking biotin.

2068 2018-08-13 19:36:20 You should definitely try coconut oil! Makes your skin soooo soft
2069 2018-08-13 19:36:09 SW isn’t supposed to work that way, though. 

Use ‘free’ foods and you can bung in as much as you like. Oil and butter are a no, as is fat on meat. Other than that, it’s easy.
2070 2018-08-13 19:36:07 My foundation is water based not oil based. Oil and makeup doesn’t work. Oil takes off makeup just saying. Me wearing foundation is the last thing hurting the ocean. I also don’t even use oils to take off my makeup I find soap works just as fine.
2071 2018-08-13 19:35:56 One dramatic case is the larger than life power outages in the state where #venezuela #oil production was born, Zulia and especially its capital city Maracaibo, where in last weeks, power outages last from 5 to 18 hours approx, which have hit oil production to its minimum. #oott
2072 2018-08-13 19:35:54 Madame oby had addressed dis oil low prices a very long tym ago in dis same Twitter. How is it dat u didn't get to query her then?.
2073 2018-08-13 19:35:54 Ty Ellen I got max strength cold capsules and olbas oil and been drinking plenty of fluids
2074 2018-08-13 19:35:50 I figured it out. She saying land restitution is like broccoli. That means welling of synthetic oil. But global warming and DNA can eat. And hair shampoo is bad for diets. Got it?
2075 2018-08-13 19:35:42 Girl are you from my dreams? 

Bc your soulless eyes, oil slick hair, clicking mandibles and multiple limbs make me want to curl into a fetal position and cry.
2076 2018-08-13 19:35:37 - oil her ass up w baby oil, and let her ride and work it up like oil on a pan
2077 2018-08-13 19:35:24 Believe it or not, corn oil isn’t always the best lubricant.
I may favor corn cobs as projectiles, but that doesn’t mean that I believe corn products to always be the best choice for a given purpose.
2078 2018-08-13 19:35:19 Interesting point, although the general idea of “diversifying from oil” makes some sense for them. Guess we’ll see. 

Could also be that this is total BS concocted to avoid legal trouble from those tweets last week.

2087 2018-08-13 19:34:24 The #US Gulf of #Mexico supplies one of every six barrels of the nation’s #oil production and remains a critical part of its #energy strategy.
2088 2018-08-13 19:34:22 an electric car company eventually causing an oil rich kingdom to commit 9/11 part two is not where i expected us to be in 2018 but it fits. it's a little on the nose but it fits.
2089 2018-08-13 19:34:21 Simply remarkable.  And they worry about oil and gas lines?
2090 2018-08-13 19:34:13 China removed the 25% Tariff on USA Oil.

2091 2018-08-13 19:34:12 Bought some bio oil today, gotta get rid of my mommy stripes
2092 2018-08-13 19:34:02 Better work for the oil industry or remain poor.
2093 2018-08-13 19:33:54 i have a face mask on, a hot oil treatment in my hair, eating a chopped salad... my birthday is tomorrow... this is self care
2094 2018-08-13 19:33:53 Sundried tomatoes and feta in olive oil is also quite tastylicious.
2095 2018-08-13 19:33:48 Honestly, as a shareholder I think is a stupid decision, and gives too much control of he all electri future to a major oil producer.
2096 2018-08-13 19:33:48 @Rwakakamba ; There's so much&huge potential that if we invested in Agriculture like the money we're going to be getting or already getting from the Oil, you would think that 50% of that in my view should go into building Agric infrastructure #NBSPeopleAndPower @nbstv @Bridge_UG
2097 2018-08-13 19:33:46 Starting in the 2010 season, the winner of the White Sox vs. Cubs series would win the newly designated BP Cup. 

 April 2010 was the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and the cup was never heard from again.

2101 2018-08-13 19:33:21 I could be drenched in oil dragging chain and chanting doh fraid de jab. But I’m sadly in a client meeting trying not to jump out the window...
2102 2018-08-13 19:33:19 have no sense of how to heal humanity-- by getting rid of worst laws, changing worst nations--  because oil money is buying so much stuff.. guess what? talks of Tesla funded by Saudi Arabia?? an oil producing islamic nation is trying to buy a company that can make world oil-free
2103 2018-08-13 19:33:16 Wait, isn’t Big Oil on $TSLA ‘s side now? This is getting so confusing .

2115 2018-08-13 19:32:05 Alaska is funded by oil.  Which is the enemy of those advocating UBI.  I don't actually have a stance on UBI, as I don't think we can realistically look at it until we address healthcare and education in Ontario.
2116 2018-08-13 19:31:59 I just dredged it in an egg & milk mixture and then in seasoned flour. Only oil used was a bit of nonstick spray.
2117 2018-08-13 19:31:28 CBD oil - THC is the element that causes paranoia in those that have that reaction.  CBD has been a lifesaver  as well as ASMR - I use it like meditation not just for sleep #judgeme 
2118 2018-08-13 19:31:24 It is not an oil company investing in TSLA, it is Saudi Arabia, the country. They are strategically diversifying into companies that Bertel Schmitt is shorting. LOL

2120 2018-08-13 19:31:04 What if the GERS figures actually show a positive balance for Scotland?

 The intention being to show them as accurate and that Scotland has good and bad years, which would be better supported as part of a larger Union?

Oil price up c40% and some tweets recently supporting GERS.

2135 2018-08-13 19:29:34 Oh wow what are the pros of using them ?? I imagine just being able to use oil like a marker haha
2136 2018-08-13 19:29:33 Same as it is now; a grifting snake oil salesman misogynist who will die in prison.
2137 2018-08-13 19:29:22 If you need oil for your blockchain, may I suggest a bottle of [this] (shows magic bottle).  It's a 9:1 mix of blockchain oil and headlamp fluid so that you can be a family day *and* NIGHT!!!!!
2138 2018-08-13 19:29:11 Snake oil  2 different people 
2139 2018-08-13 19:29:03 Venezuela is a failed economy due to not diversifying their economy. Their economy was actually great and in the early 2000s they were one of the richest countries in South America. When oil prices dropped their income dropped and they went broke. Venezuela isn’t an arguments
2140 2018-08-13 19:28:55 Did a sweep of calls to state agencies re: the earthquake this morning - @AlaskaDEC and AOGCC - and they also report no spills/damage at oil facilities as a result of yesterday's earthquake
2141 2018-08-13 19:28:44 They did not, they showed up to one of my talks about the risks to privacy. Would you criticize scholars studying global warming for educating oil industry about its risks?
2142 2018-08-13 19:28:41 i dreamed i hugged kanata lots and kissed him A LOT and i had to look for him at the beach at night holding an oil lamp
2143 2018-08-13 19:28:39 I've had the coconut oil, lemon juice, and honey face and hair mask and drenched my hair and spread it on my face.
2144 2018-08-13 19:28:22 Use a conditioner and a oil like olive or castor and put your hair in cornrows or a bun and wear a cap!!. The conditioner will fill your pores and the oil will repel the water. Afterwards wash your hair with shampoo and keep up with deep conditioning and protein treatments
2145 2018-08-13 19:28:20 I blame some it on the slow erosion of her IQ from the fluoride contamination of her water supply in the oil patch -I’ve listened to my sister get dumbed down over the years -they can’t reason anymore.
2146 2018-08-13 19:28:19 If your interested I’d be happy to make something for you. Anything in particular you are looking for? Oil on canvas? Digital print? Watercolor?
2147 2018-08-13 19:28:09 @MMFlint that tweet didn’t age well. What do you think happened with socialism and free stuff? Venezuela was rich in oil and minerals. Ppl were lied to, they sold the oil for the next 20 yrs. to enrich themselves (president & VP) ppl eating out of the garbage. WOW SOCIALISM WORKS
2148 2018-08-13 19:28:01 Do you have some AMAZING #NewEnergy, #Solar, or #GreenEnergy photos? Post them on this thread for everyone to appreciate.

2149 2018-08-13 19:27:58 You: "I’m an equity man myself and do not delve into areas of investment that are foreign to me."

Also you: "I’M AN OIL MAN AGAIN — PREPARE FOR A FULL COLLAPSE IN OIL"

Homie I'm not even trying to shit on you. 90% I can see the sarcasm but that 10%?? .....bruh

2151 2018-08-13 19:27:41 Can’t make this stuff up. Getting the oil changed at the Honda dealer to get ready for the ride home tomorrow. Porter wrecks our car in the dealer parking lot. Will take a week in the body shop... God must be protecting us from something
2152 2018-08-13 19:27:39 Lol those products won't work if you got excessive oil,you better cut off anything that contains too much of fat for a day or two then use them and you will see change
2153 2018-08-13 19:27:35 I saw 30 seconds and had to change the channel.  Why was he asking the audience to raise their hands? Then, he commented  -“ah come on, why so few?” When few raised their hands. What a jerk. He should have a sheepherders horse and cart behind him and selling snake oil 
2154 2018-08-13 19:27:27 Ball of Oil karma. Helllooooo
2155 2018-08-13 19:27:02 Oil’s done though. Scottish governments own figures tell us we now spend £13bn more than we collect.
2156 2018-08-13 19:26:50 *oil corporations. Neighbours of logic.
2157 2018-08-13 19:26:46 Schedule a oil change before this week over .
2158 2018-08-13 19:26:45 Do you use the perfume oil or the spray?

2160 2018-08-13 19:26:36 The year is 2043. I've just sent my youngest off to college. I decide to call my parents and see how they're doing

My father: "ArE yOU PuTtINg oIL iN ThaT caR OF YOuRs?"
2161 2018-08-13 19:26:24 I know I need an oil change and some more shit, I need to do some more shit
2162 2018-08-13 19:26:20 What was i even doing before i started using bio oil
2163 2018-08-13 19:26:15 I see a USD collapse in mid - long term once the dollar funding issue is unwound. In my view that would lead to a massive increase in the nominal cost of oil.
2164 2018-08-13 19:26:13 Snake oil for Obama!
2165 2018-08-13 19:26:12 A little olive oil, onions, peppers, salt and black pepper. On a nice loaf of italian bread.  Delish
2166 2018-08-13 19:26:12 They forgot to mention the palm oil....
2167 2018-08-13 19:26:08 Yes I have been taking it for my Psoriasis, Anxiety and other medical conditions and I'm so glad I started taking it. My Psoriasis isn't as flared up and I'm not inflamed. My anxiety has calmed down. I would recommend you trying it! Everyone should try CBD Oil!
2168 2018-08-13 19:25:56 More body oil? No, he ran out of it for that picture.
2169 2018-08-13 19:25:55 I'd rather have hot burning oil poured through my eyes.  My TV goes off every time you guys cover his hate rallies.  They serve NO PURPOSE!!!!!  Don't be part of the problem MSNBC.

2172 2018-08-13 19:25:38 Can’t wait to buy an XL popcorn, dump 5 bags of raisenettes in it, squirt butter over it until it looks like oil soup, and see the movie where puppets say ,”ass”
2173 2018-08-13 19:25:38 Grazie Peter! Yes, please go see Franceso if you have the time! It's a wonderful experience, I didn't even mention his fantastic olive oil!

2176 2018-08-13 19:25:22 Singer Sargent is like.. the realest oil painter ever. He so lazily gestured across the work and still captured the real essence of value and texture.. then contrasts the blurred portions with such realistic forms and movement.
2177 2018-08-13 19:25:12 Can one of y’all buy me some beard oil I’ll love y’all for a minute
2178 2018-08-13 19:25:08 *rub knees with oil*
2179 2018-08-13 19:25:00 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
2180 2018-08-13 19:24:59 Do you know the cost of living in Norway compared to Scotland? Do you know the Income Tax regime in Norway compared to Scotland and UK. And DO YOU KNOW the comparison between oil revenue in Norway compared to Scotland? I DO & THE ANSWERS TO THE REST. #GetEducated

2182 2018-08-13 19:24:57 I use dove soap to bath, ead skin brightening cream and bio oil go tshasa.

2183 2018-08-13 19:24:56 It's amazing what women do to look pretty for us. Nicollette has been in getting ready the last hour, while I'm chilling outside having a drink and chilling. I'll go in and slap some paste in the hair now, bit of beard oil and aftershave and I'm good to go

2187 2018-08-13 19:24:33 have had a coconut oil scented baby sleeping on my chest for the past 1.5 hours and I’ve never been more at peace
2188 2018-08-13 19:24:25 I don’t think they’re anywhere close being serious about RE nor EV:

1) their fetichism for oil is like a religion (understandable when you’re n1 world producer of cheap oil)
2) they’re still contemplating the idea of having 100% local content for solar panels.

2191 2018-08-13 19:23:42 Miracle Whip is a throwback commie substitute for the real stuff. Real Americans eat real eggs and oil. Cast off your condiment oppressor.
2192 2018-08-13 19:23:36 Yes and how good was a ladder. And where are they on the political stage with things you consume? Russia is only good for diamonds oil and a few other things. Its cou try suffers besides

2200 2018-08-13 19:22:36 I can't find the handle again . You can blend onions or grate them, then extract the juice using a sieve. I heard some mix the juice with olive oil
2201 2018-08-13 19:22:34 A LOT  castor oil and coconut oil, olive oil leave in conditioner, coconut cholesterol, aunt Jackie’s don’t shrink curl gel, and shea moisture curl smoothie
2202 2018-08-13 19:22:33 These guys are def not the “good guys”. Wouldn’t it make more sense for them to destroy Tesla and EV’s considering they are 100% reliant and invested in oil?!

2208 2018-08-13 19:22:06 200?Yes, Most of the easy oil has been found. Fracking is not a century solution. NatGas is and has replaced oil in many respects. Nuclear is an option going forward. Wind and solar are great peaker sources. Oil prices will remain less volatile than 15 yrs ago.
2209 2018-08-13 19:21:53 What are your feelings in avocado oil? Seems like it should be ok, similar to olive.
2210 2018-08-13 19:21:52 How so?

I have to cook SW most of the time. The lack of oil is troublesome but the rest is ok.
2211 2018-08-13 19:21:42 Coconut oil all over your head leave it on for as long as you can like on a day off or go to sleep in it then shampoo it out really well do it like once a month it’ll change your life haha
2212 2018-08-13 19:21:25 @elonmusk sir request you to not to even think of taking tesla private especially based on Saudi invst plan. There investment is a hedge against future consumption in oil. Either they would take co to heights or destroy it. Co being listed will always keep check on Saudis.
2213 2018-08-13 19:21:23 Please elaborate further.
Olive oil or sunflower oil?
Garlic or just a drop of lemon?
Industrial or home made?
2214 2018-08-13 19:20:43 Discuss the Climate change,Global warming but have we studied minute fact,Colouring of Buildings (Govt.&Pvt.)by Oil Paints in Rural as well as Urban Area&it's impact? It reflects sunlight without absorbing the rise in heat&contribute to rise in temperature which affect rain fall.
2215 2018-08-13 19:20:41 Venezuela is a failed economy due to not diversifying their economy. Their economy was actually great and in the early 2000s they were one of the richest countries in South America. When oil prices dropped their income dropped and they went broke. Venezuela isn’t an arguments
2216 2018-08-13 19:20:39 rose hip oil has changed my life
2217 2018-08-13 19:20:37 Glad I got out of oil....unfortunately I was too late to ride it back up.
2218 2018-08-13 19:20:34 My refusal to support the #KinderMorgan expansion is because it violates Indigenous rights.

When people use arguments like “we have no choice”, and “the oil will be extracted regardless”, I expose those as the lies they are. Lies being used to justify yet more colonialism.
2219 2018-08-13 19:20:07 Norway has shared the wealth from North Sea oil and gas. People enjoy a great standard of living,and don't mind paying taxes. In the UK,the oil and gas money was never shared,and is probably lurking in offshore accounts.And the recipients avoid taxation.
2220 2018-08-13 19:20:01 But only the gruesome killings of the oil rich country's leaders

2223 2018-08-13 19:19:37 @RealAlexJones is a scumbag snake oil salesman. Fact

The way he talks about Sandy Hook is disgusting. Fact

He should be allowed to say whatever the fuck he wants as long as he doesn’t incite violence. Fact

If he’s wrong, the courts should decide, not Twitter or Facebook. Fact.

2234 2018-08-13 19:17:43 an Egyptian man on Venice Beach just gave me free oil and offered me 20 camels to come to Egypt and marry him. I told him I’d think about it.

2242 2018-08-13 19:16:43 lol i found a post it at addie’s house on her mom’s desk with “cbd oil?” written on it and idk what’s gonna happen but i’m ready
2243 2018-08-13 19:16:37 EE was about getting CDN oil to more markets including Eastern Canada. 

Both the shippers and the refineries wanted to work in the spot markets which is why you didn't get your guarantee.   You had to trust the market to have confidence the refineries would have upgraded.
2244 2018-08-13 19:16:16 It will super interesting when the biggest oil producer in the world is going to fund a privatization of an electric car company.

2250 2018-08-13 19:16:05 You don’t get it @Sulliphotoz . Ripple Labs is a company making use of #XRP, which is a commodity (asset). It’s like you blaming Shell or BP for the price of oil going down. Until XRapid goes live, the price is driven purely by speculation and manipulation, not usage.
2251 2018-08-13 19:15:58 Except this is all based on your refusal to accept the purpose of he TMEP. It is not to produce MORE oil, it is to move oil by pipeline instead of rail, and ensure we get the best price for what we do produce to fund government spending, which includes renewable energy spending.
2252 2018-08-13 19:15:45 The spin you’re trying to put on this entire situation is actually quite pathetic. The Saudi regime is emboldened by Trump's complicity n their oil. They are trying to force everyone into submission.
2253 2018-08-13 19:15:45 Trump and Historical Fluency are like Oil and Water:   He contaminates everything he is too dense to fathom.

2258 2018-08-13 19:15:21 Its okay. It is (technically) oil and eggs and those are good in many many things.
2259 2018-08-13 19:15:19 For cookbooks, I say “please avoid telegraphese”—Heat oil in skillet. Add garlic. etc.
2260 2018-08-13 19:15:02 The only reason the Oil vid was mentioned, was because in that vid, he touches on the same corrupt people controlling the oil are also wanting to control social media.. might want to watch those vids.. they are VERY informative! The James Corbett is a triple A presenter!
2261 2018-08-13 19:15:00 Having to pay for an oil change smfh
2262 2018-08-13 19:14:57 China and Russia will soon own all the oil and only take Gold/Bitcoin in return for Oil
2263 2018-08-13 19:14:52 I'm with you, the gold was top notch but the road blacks were nice as well 
2264 2018-08-13 19:14:41 Ahh thank u!! So many things and it’s taken be ages to find what works but I use a wet brush now, micro fibre towel, sulfate free shampoo+cond, oils, curl gel, argan oil masks!! Shampoos etc are from a brand called Shea Moisture which is so lovely and hydrating!

2266 2018-08-13 19:14:33 Lady on BBC2: I decided to make my own granola after seeing how much sugar was in the shop bought stuff 

Same lady: melts coconut oil, honey and maple syrup for her homemade granola
2267 2018-08-13 19:14:29 As PM I wont these games. You want to cut us off no problem we have our own oil . Turn it on give Canadians their Jobs back. No need to play with these countries.  I will create hundreds of  thousands  of  jobs  for real Canadians . #JohnBellizzi4PM
2268 2018-08-13 19:14:28 I've been using purpul hair oil for my hairline and I'm happy, it has also made my hair thick.
2269 2018-08-13 19:14:28 Soooo WHY did Trump hire her in the 4th place!
He knew who she was.
He fired her 3 X’s before!
This is on Trump.
Trump’s narcissistic addiction is not good for the USA.
He hired friends, relatives, industry execs  w/opposition to the position they were hired for:
Oil/EPA
Coal/EPA
2270 2018-08-13 19:14:27 I’ve been waiting at the fucking dealership for an oil change FOR MORE THAN A FUCKING HOUR

2276 2018-08-13 19:13:52 can’t tell if I put on too much oil this morning or if I’m having hot flashes 
2277 2018-08-13 19:13:47 Who is she doing a great job for? The oil industry? @OilGasCanada For sure she is. We're paying for orphan well loan +interest now. What's next? The tailings liability? The orphan wells entire? Redwater decision allows industry to walk. Nice set up. REDA makes AER immune. #Ableg
2278 2018-08-13 19:13:29 YES your skin is overcompensating by producing more oil which is why u r breaking out
2279 2018-08-13 19:13:20 @oil_lilly อยากเลียให้ชอบเลีย.เลียได้ทุกรูเลียให้จนเสร็จทางปาก(ลิ้นเร็ว)
2280 2018-08-13 19:13:04 Always wear gloves when handling any chemicals as cleaners are designed to remove oil and grease as well as the natural oils in your skin.
2281 2018-08-13 19:13:00 Saudi’s realize that the party of Big Oil is coming to an end, and they are relocating assets before oil drops to $1 a barrel. Oil is on the way out, but these Bloomberg analysts are probably still trying to make money off oil futures.
2282 2018-08-13 19:12:50 it's not solely about the Oil though, #Gaddafi #Saddam were killed cos they wanted to trade in gold , Syria was attacked because they wanted it to, US currency is not gold backed it's useless. no face value. US produces more OIL than its Arab allies
2283 2018-08-13 19:12:49 BAD people are executing their "Kneecap America" plan perfectly:  Takeover education and our top law enforcement agency, choke the pudding out of free speech, seize control of our land, water, gas, oil and minerals and WALLA! But, they "forgot" about us "forgotten ones." 
2284 2018-08-13 19:12:43 Listen I had oil in places that confused me..
2285 2018-08-13 19:12:41 Saudi Arabia looking to buy out Tesla in order to go private clearly points towards a post oil GCC era.

2291 2018-08-13 19:12:14 That looked a shitload of oil and honey for a supposedly healthy granola. Let’s face it, it’s basically crumbled hobnobs whether you make it yourself or not. #nadiyasfamilyfavourites
2292 2018-08-13 19:12:12 I need to go get an oil change, but here i am, still in bed. 
2293 2018-08-13 19:12:07 #nadiyasfamilyfavourites 

Just because coconut oil is slightly healthier than regular oil doesn’t mean you should use it just for the sake of it. Why not omit oil altogether?
2294 2018-08-13 19:12:06 I'm partial to the home gold (which I have, made up with "Bertuzzi"), but those are glorious.
2295 2018-08-13 19:12:03 How people does actually make Monday day? I still drunk, stink of oil and barely functioning. Mass still hadda play later thooo
2296 2018-08-13 19:11:49 last week my partner got his oil changed and literally we didn’t say a word about it or text about it, then i was getting ads for the exact oil change place he went to ; ; its so weird!
2297 2018-08-13 19:11:47 Doesnt a snake oil salesman have to be good at selling snake oil?

2303 2018-08-13 19:10:50 I have to go get an oil change today .... I really hate taking care of car stuff. like this is definitely a man’s job 
2304 2018-08-13 19:10:48 I understand that. But if we continue to run a massive physical deficit in oil (approx 10mbpd), then we must be running a massive surplus elsewhere, right?
2305 2018-08-13 19:10:17 Hi sweetie! I was sceptical also about CBD Oil myself. In March of this year I decided to try it to see if it would help my Psoriasis, Anxiety and other medical conditions and it has helped so much. I would recommend doing research on different CBD Oil. Don't be afraid to try!

2308 2018-08-13 19:10:04 if someone is feeling generous, I could use $50 to get my oil changed. thanks!

2309 2018-08-13 19:10:03 A few truths are about to come to light.1.Saudi Arabia will sell its Aramco shares to Russia and China,both taking 30% each .2.The world things Saudi ARabia  has billions of barrels of oil,truth is they don’t and yes oil is running out.3.Oil will go to 200 usd/barrel soon.
2310 2018-08-13 19:09:57 @SekgobelaLebo she has the oil and one day I will meet her.. God bless her
2311 2018-08-13 19:09:45 Because that just means the Saudis will sell the oil at the same price to someone else
2312 2018-08-13 19:09:34 Olive oil, soy sauce, lemon juice, Worcestershire, basil, parsley, garlic.
2313 2018-08-13 19:09:34 @autozone What a ripoff. We spent over $300 on oil change supplies, my rebate was rejected saying "no offer number given". How can this be so when I sent in the rebate form WHICH CONTAINS THE NUMBER?? Switching to Advance Auto Parts.
2314 2018-08-13 19:09:32 rail companies have been hesitant to invest in new rail capacity for shipping oil, especially if the business opportunity of doing so only lasts for another two or three year
2315 2018-08-13 19:09:29 so ironic that #Tesla is going 2 largest oil producer
2316 2018-08-13 19:09:28 Y’all think if I put coconut oil on my knees I’ll grow taller ?
2317 2018-08-13 19:09:18 Snake Oil salesman? Sounds like Corbyn and his hard left acolytes.
2318 2018-08-13 19:09:18 This is an accounting of the entire US energy system's balance sheet, not just oil.
2319 2018-08-13 19:09:08 New! On sale, too! Both shampoo and conditioner is $10.29 down from $11.49 
Great for the dry hair that summer creates! Undo the damage thanks to #fairtrade Marula oil!

2323 2018-08-13 19:08:42 “The Western Canadian oil patch is operating on the edge of available takeaway capacity, which makes discounts especially sensitive to shifts in supply (e.g. Syncrude ramping up from its outage), demand (e.g. higher-than-anticipated Midwest refinery maintenance)
2324 2018-08-13 19:08:34 Caster oil money has arrived in Limpopo,  are you ready to sell your best players @polokwane_city ? With this caster oil money I see Man City of SA
2325 2018-08-13 19:08:29 What are you talking about? This conversation isn't about "oil money..." it's highlighting the double standards of @MagicalMahrez26 No jealousy from me about Abu Dhabi Group bankrolling City, if it was the other way round I'd just be careful about taking the moral high ground.

2330 2018-08-13 19:07:51 The US produces half the oil is consumes. So, that category isn't even close to "independence." What am I missing, Gregor? In which energy category do we have a massive surplus to make up that shortfall?
2331 2018-08-13 19:07:51 And then there is the $963M subsidy to coal industry. Want 2 get rid of subsidies, then get rid of them all. Oil & Gas don’t need it; O&G give US consumers no breaks, so why are we giving them any?

2336 2018-08-13 19:07:22 Of course Ford will behave like a dictator. He already sounds like a bible-thumping preacher, we know he sells snake oil & runs on slogans.

2339 2018-08-13 19:06:58 CBD oil or just cannabis in general. If you can find the right strain it can really help your anxiety and not get you high. I hated my anxiety medicine because it made me feel slothy, cannabis is the only thing that works for me.
2340 2018-08-13 19:06:49 Oil money talks even though the left is trying to not use oil and funny that Tesla is trying to get Oil money (guess it’s not profitable being green without subsidies)

2358 2018-08-13 19:04:24 Dude I stopped going to @pepboysauto for that very reason. My dad owned a oil/tire shop when I was a kid. No way it should take more than 20 minutes TOPS to do an oil change. Every time I went to pep boys it took 45-60 minutes minimum.

2365 2018-08-13 19:03:20 India has launched the second round of bidding for small discovered fields, estimated to contain as much as US$14 billion (1 trillion Indian rupees) worth of oil and gas reserves.
2366 2018-08-13 19:03:06 Get real @dailynation! How dare you tell your readers that a litre of crude oil will yield a litre of refined oil? No wonder newspapers are derided as good for wrapping meat pekee!!  
..and propagating fake news of course1+refine=1 
2367 2018-08-13 19:02:58 India aims to raise its domestic oil and gas production and possibly cut its massive crude oil import bill as its oil demand is expected to continue to grow in the foreseeable future. Currently, Indian imports around 80 percent of the crude oil it consumes

2373 2018-08-13 19:02:04 I go to sleep next to men. I wake up next to men. I get naked in front of men. I ride in close proximity to men with shaved legs and tight clothes. I get covered in oil and massaged my men.

2411 2018-08-13 18:57:00 Fun fact:  

If every person on the earth used as much oil as people in the US, demand would be 448 million barrels a day.

It is currently 94 million barrels a day.
2412 2018-08-13 18:56:58 We are now only 20% dependent on foreign oil now. Soon less than 10%.  God bless our American Military Forces, but at the end of the day I'm  glad they fight them over there where they can defend themselves, than over here where our civilians are helpless.
2413 2018-08-13 18:56:50 no allergy its very common tho... still i even have to sneeze all the time so i hope the oil im pitting just doesn’t go away
2414 2018-08-13 18:56:44 No
2415 2018-08-13 18:56:43 This is ultimately Big Oil's preferred solution: Implement a carbon price that affects non-oil sectors, but leaves transport untouched. Essentially: pay a little bit to make carbon someone else's problem.

2421 2018-08-13 18:55:55 Is this I wonder a way of prolonging the life of petrol/oil driven vehicles and ensuring demand for oil.
2422 2018-08-13 18:55:54 Taking the loss on Granite Oil $GXO. Another speculative oil E&P that can't get it together and doesn't look like they will. Taking our lumps on this one.

2427 2018-08-13 18:54:58 I think dynamite was used to blow out oil fires. Armed missiles into the inferno? Jk.
2428 2018-08-13 18:54:56 No. It didn't work at all. Wound up with a chunk of cornbread soaked in oil. Tasted like shit and my truck ran worse than it did before I tried the cornbread in the air filter trick. Just a heads up.
2429 2018-08-13 18:54:55 Use light colored paper. Use dark crayon to trace hand and bones. Then use Q-Tip and oil to color inside the bones. Place on window and turn out lights.

2431 2018-08-13 18:54:33 No fight here. So good and soooo easy to make - NOT the Julia Child way (forgive me): widemouthed canning jar, immersion blender, cup light olive oil, 1 egg, pinch of salt, squirt of mustard, squirt of lemon juice. Blend for about 1 minute, right in the jar. Perfection.

2434 2018-08-13 18:54:24 Active lifestyle, acceptance of satiating meat along with the grain, and above all, zero seed oil such as soybean oil. Soybean oil is the most obesity inducing aspect of the US diet by far.

I'd avoid WCS-weighted stuff, CVE is integrated so I'll omit them from the list of shame (short term speaking)
2440 2018-08-13 18:53:38 It looks like you did. UM I kinda liken frying tofu to frying eggs so when you dont use enough oil and don't leave it alone long enough, it sticks to the pan.

2445 2018-08-13 18:53:12 Canada tried to push their ideology as if it were from a position of power, but do we really have any leverage on them? Not unless we're willing to develop our own oil reserves, which clearly isn't the case.

2447 2018-08-13 18:52:53 Mr. Zinke is the probably the last person we would want to consult about wildfires.  He will call for more logging and for oil wells in the burned areas. His mission: Dismantle & weaken any regulations or policies that protect nature and wildlife.  Euphemisms/excuses fail.
2448 2018-08-13 18:52:44 @pepboysauto is the worst! I went to them for an oil change once.... it took over two hours before they started and only started once I went In and said something! I’ve never been back!

2458 2018-08-13 18:51:51 Pharma and big oil is running things. Curruption
2459 2018-08-13 18:51:50 We are effectively self sufficient. 400% more oil is exported than imported. But the market dictates where it is imported/exported from. Nothing we can do about that without nationalizing the industry or taking other severe market control measures.
2460 2018-08-13 18:51:44 It’s another move away from oil. If you are an oil investor you’d better get out soon

Especially when you’ve done nothing to educate yourself about it and you’ve never experienced it. It’s like a doctor changing my oil and the doctor insisting he knows what he’s doing.
2466 2018-08-13 18:51:12 @VW doesn’t do free first oil changes anymore... what kind of joke is that
2467 2018-08-13 18:51:10 Let me also remind you to never hand over your money in any way, shape, or form to anyone you meet here in #OOTT or online #Trading. Don't get fooled out here. You don't have to pay for what you look for. #WTI #Oil #Crude #CrudeOil #Brent #OPEC #CL_F #DXY #ES_F #NQ_F #EURUSD
2468 2018-08-13 18:51:06 Our goal should be exporting our oil to the rest of the world, not importing oil from countries with terrible human rights records and no environmental standards!
2469 2018-08-13 18:51:04 Beautiful hedge for Saudi against oil.  Investment in Tesla. Either they would destroy the co and make sure no one ever thinks of electric cars or will take them to heights. Time will tell let’s see.
2470 2018-08-13 18:51:01 Acupuncture!!!! CBD oil!!!!!
2471 2018-08-13 18:51:00 It's probably because they want to stifle the growth of electric cars so they can keep oil prices high!
2472 2018-08-13 18:50:56 Oil paintings too.
2473 2018-08-13 18:50:56 le russian is so oily, the minute you bite into it the oil starts spraying everywhere 
2474 2018-08-13 18:50:54 Except for @SenJohnMcCain who you've said was not a war hero, when he is and you're a four time draft dodger. So now you're naming a bill for him? You're a two face lying snake oil salesman. A used car salesman who would sell an old lady a car that will blow up 10m off the lot.
2475 2018-08-13 18:50:50 And the fact that oil prices have bounced back significantly from earlier lows have, I'm sure had minimal impact on that?  Come on.
2476 2018-08-13 18:50:49  taylor thought baby oil was for putting on babies on the summer @TaylorLafferty
2477 2018-08-13 18:50:43 @billmckibben The oil industry and its institutional investors appear to be banking on the assumption that we'll fail to solve climate change. They are wrong. "For all history shows that the effort to win progress represents the most determined and steadfast aspirations of men."

2480 2018-08-13 18:50:28 I needed to make a hot drink to mix my canna oil in and was going to make tea until I forgot I had a whole gallon of chocolate almond milk and I heated that bitch up and OH MY GOD is it the best hot chocolate I’ve ever had, never even thought

2484 2018-08-13 18:50:18 I absolutely hate when people try to upsell to me at Valvoline. Just give me clean oil and send me on my way please.
2485 2018-08-13 18:50:14 On Jan 20, 2017 Donald trump put his hand on a book he's never read, swore an oath he had no intention of keeping to defend a document he's also never read.

He's a charlatan & a cheat, a con man selling snake oil to fools who'll never accept they've been conned
He's #badChicken
2486 2018-08-13 18:50:12 While you're in town get some Ramen noodles and some stewed tomatoes. Grab a jar of parmesan and make your own spaghetti. Use a bit of olive oil on your noodles and they won't gum up.  Eat hardy!
2487 2018-08-13 18:50:11 Elon Musk mentions taking Tesla private and Saudi investors immediately take the frontline for buying the company... Either this is a giant oil hedge, or Tesla has seen its days
2488 2018-08-13 18:50:01 You could use a thickening agent like cornstarch or something and still use you coconut oil

2490 2018-08-13 18:49:53 There is a song on @PanicAtTheDisco new album that has a chime that sounds exactly like the "No oil, stop the car immediately" sound in my car.  The first time I heard it I was like WHAT ???  WHAT?? WHAT IS WARNING ME???

2501 2018-08-13 18:48:43 The KRG published the 3rd #Deloitte report on Oil and Gas Review in the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, but the question is which the KRG has never answered, how has the #KRG spent the revenues it has received from oil exports & domestic incomes? remember, KRG doesnt have a budget law.

2506 2018-08-13 18:47:49 Ya know - that's the exact word to describe our current capitalist/corportist country. Predatory. That's not what using capital to build business was intended to be. Pedatory bankers, stockbrokers, timber, oil, medical care, construction - everyone is a predator these days.

2533 2018-08-13 18:44:35 The point of the vote to accept big rotten oil $$$$$$$$$ is to get huge donations from oil executives, not average workers. They will pretend it is for workers but we know better!

2541 2018-08-13 18:43:39 We don't need tons of pipelines, oil use is on decline and the investment of that many pipelines would be ridiculous, environmental issues aside.. Also Saudi oil is a spit in the bucket compared to other sources.
2542 2018-08-13 18:43:35 .of oil? There's no mention of oil but if it goes in a barrel.

2546 2018-08-13 18:43:09 So the Saudis are trying to help Tesla go private. Does this mean they're trying to break Americas dependence on oil so we stop bombing the Middle East for theirs?

2558 2018-08-13 18:41:16 Getting your oil changed always feels like a little bit of a bad deal. Like, a super, super low key heist that you agree to. You drive away a little pooper going, “I guess that was the right thing to do.”

2562 2018-08-13 18:41:01 @houstonlifetv disappointed in this segment. Express oil change places aren't good? Dealerships aren't that great either. And doesn't guarantee a good service. I've been ripped off many times from a dealership. I can't believe that guy said that
2563 2018-08-13 18:40:56 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
2564 2018-08-13 18:40:42 Yeah, WD40 was literally just made to displace water.
It penetrates fairly well, and has some lubricity, but if you desperately need to unseize stuff then mixing a little household oil in helps a lot.
2565 2018-08-13 18:40:41 You mean like the billions in subsidies that go to oil, coal, and gas companies (with larger market caps)? Your donors enjoy massive subsidies. Their industries literally invented energy subsidies. You are advocating an end to all subsidies, correct? Or is it just RE subsidies?
2566 2018-08-13 18:40:37 Remember last late fall/early winter when there were so many ultra bulls here in #OOTT who got orgasms over MBS taking power in Saudi Arabia, and peddled that bull shit to help oil's BS rise?

2570 2018-08-13 18:40:18 Pretty pathetic when the leader of the opposition attacks the NDP leader without even knowing what he’s taking about, then continues to site an article as his source, an article which states the exact opposite. Additionally there’s no such thing as clean ethical oil.
2571 2018-08-13 18:40:16 Not all fats are created equally, I definitely am trying to avoid seed oils like corn oil and canola oil, that are both chemically extracted and not pressed, but other fats I like.

2576 2018-08-13 18:40:04 My understanding  is that we were aidng the British Against the Nazis.

We also placed an Oil embargo on Japan, which goaded them into attacking us. I don’t think Pearl Harbor was as much as a “Surprise Attack” as History depicts. We had reason to expect a possible attack

2603 2018-08-13 18:36:48 Last year they announced about  building a massive 200GW solar park too. May be they are hoping Tesla's EV charging Network and powerwall tech will reap them benefits in long term? 
Theyve been trying to curtail the burning of oil to generate electricity and focus on oil export.
2604 2018-08-13 18:36:38 lol the death of dinosaurs was just done to serve humans for oil.

Understood lol
2605 2018-08-13 18:35:59 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
2606 2018-08-13 18:35:53 Oil Leak EmailsPutin Hates One,DOESNT
2607 2018-08-13 18:35:51 Firmen wie Facebook sind durchaus vergleichbar mir den amerikanischen Monopolisten der Industrialisierung wie Rockefellers Standard Oil Company.
Es brauchte einen hohen politischen Druck, um diese zu zerschlagen. Ein wichtiger Schritt wäre der Zwang zu „Transport-Schnittstellen“.
2608 2018-08-13 18:35:39 Islamic or not, the bottom line is that these Gulf states are dictatorships. Arrested for drinking a glass of wine? The west, so proud of being democratic, should forget the oil money and sever their ties with these backward places.
2609 2018-08-13 18:35:27 Idk know who a bigger threat dem Africans or them oil field niggas
2610 2018-08-13 18:35:22 HIII, Kristy CBD Oil could work for you, it’s known for helping with anxiety, stress, headaches and so many other things. I know you don’t smoke, and I’m sure in Washington you can find CBD without THC. Hope this could help 
2611 2018-08-13 18:35:18 Do you use oil paints?
2612 2018-08-13 18:35:14 Oil is unethical. 

GOT IT.
2613 2018-08-13 18:35:08 Yeah. I was not shy about bitching to the sales guys about our oil money-addicted politicians holding back EV development. Campaign contributions is probably the biggest reason we don't all have access to affordable EV now.
2614 2018-08-13 18:35:04 Good phrase. Oil is easily topped up too.
2615 2018-08-13 18:34:51 Dude, you’re literally an oil painting. One that the artist would just repaint over and start again
2616 2018-08-13 18:34:51 Herbal tea, bath full of lavender oil and some mellow tunes.. finding some zen after a shit day 
2617 2018-08-13 18:34:43 I love roasted garlic!  I mix it with olive oil and  brown rice.  Yum 
2618 2018-08-13 18:34:34 @dewayne11345416 If you're the one suffering from cancer of the lymphatic system or any other type of cancer, your best chance to get rid of it is to use cannabis oil. You will find all the information on "phoenix tears-rick Simpson"
2619 2018-08-13 18:34:30 334
2620 2018-08-13 18:34:21 Exactly. I really dislike this "super healthy" trend. Huge amount of cashews, coconut oil/milk in the recipe... probably more calorific than a proper dessert too 
2621 2018-08-13 18:34:13 asli ini enak bgt pulang kerja lgsg beresin kamar, mandi, ganti seprei abis itu tiduran + billie eilish + aromatic burner oil. pen nangiisss enak bgtt 
2622 2018-08-13 18:34:07 Sold his people for oil and money how many  good Cubans died in Africa far from home and for what ?
2623 2018-08-13 18:33:59 334
2624 2018-08-13 18:33:56 Oil 
2625 2018-08-13 18:33:54 I just added a cap full to my green tea. I had 2 bumps on my chin & under my nose & they went away. I usually rub some on when I break out along with coconut oil.
2626 2018-08-13 18:33:50 If they really gave a sh*t about humanity, then they wouldn't be trying to stifle our oil industry and investors. There are so many ancillary jobs that go along with oil, you can't imagine. But you share the very narrow views of Greenpeace yourself. It works for you so thats OK.
2627 2018-08-13 18:33:47 I got a nice herbal grease dey but I gotta source back a mixed oil I had dey that was sweet
2628 2018-08-13 18:33:46 Woke up at 3:00 a,m, started flat bread with 2 cups flour, handful bran, 1 cup water, 1tsp. sea salt, 1T. honey.2T. olive oil .Very soft dough. Rest 20 minutes. knead briefly. Divide in two Rise 3-4 hours, divide in 2. spread in oile pan, sprinkle with sesame seeds. Rise 45 mins.
2629 2018-08-13 18:33:40 Not atypical oil/gas industry behavior.
2630 2018-08-13 18:33:30 How would you personally define it then? It’s a gateway absolutely, but as a store of value things such as gold and oil have been speculated since the beginning. I’m fascinated by this market and how each investor views the culture around #bitcoin differently.
2631 2018-08-13 18:33:25 NOW FOR THE OLIVE OIL
2632 2018-08-13 18:33:25 Why does this coupon say it’s gonna get me a 40 dollar oil change and yet it’s over 100???
2633 2018-08-13 18:33:14 
2634 2018-08-13 18:33:12 how many miles can you go over when you need an oil change? asking for a friend
2635 2018-08-13 18:33:05 Isn't @BP_plc the culprit?  The REAL after effects of massive oil poured into the #Gulf.  I know they spend $100Ms on ads to show how great they were but now the ecosystem has something to say about it.
2636 2018-08-13 18:32:52 آخ جوونمهربونترینه منی
2637 2018-08-13 18:32:51 mannnn i been so tired lately my mf oil changes been gettin cancelled but im bout my money so that changes today 
2638 2018-08-13 18:32:47 Must have really needed an oil change.
2639 2018-08-13 18:32:46 I’m sorry... we catch it, ship it to China for cleaning, and then ship it back? No wonder we’re running out of oil.
2640 2018-08-13 18:32:40 they wont freeze they have 80% of their power elsewhere :) Try again. No country rely full only on russian oil for power?? As usual you have tried to take a trump talking point and are trying to run with it, straight into a wall.
2641 2018-08-13 18:32:37 LOL. . . Nothing about Nazism was capitalist. The Nazis controlled the means of production. Yes, companies like Volkswagen, IG Farben, Hugo Boss, Kodak, Bayer, Siemens, Coca Cola, Ford, Standard Oil, Chase Bank, IBM, etc worked directly for the Nazis using slave labor.
2642 2018-08-13 18:32:36 Apparently vanilla ice cream is very nice with a dash of olive oil.
2643 2018-08-13 18:32:32 Love love loveee checking shit off my to do list:
Oil change 
Inspection sticker 
2644 2018-08-13 18:32:30 .Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!
2645 2018-08-13 18:32:10 I hate taxes...... Fucking bullshit. So happy to be living in poverty knowing that my tax dollars are funding a rich mans war for oil 
2646 2018-08-13 18:32:07 About 100,000 Americans die each year from illness caused by pollution from cars. By accepting bribes from the oil industry, you have blood on your hands.
2647 2018-08-13 18:32:06 But soon il will be partly(?) destroyed due to Total Oil exploitation
2648 2018-08-13 18:31:57 Steve maybe you should do some reading KM tank farm is safe Why do you not have a problem with floating barges full of fuel for ships the fuel barges to Vancouver and Vancouver island  The tank farm is in a secure location where else would you like to store oil products
2649 2018-08-13 18:31:53 @Teslarati @Model3Owners $TSLA $TSLAP  Saudi Arabia investing in Tesla.  Think about the contradiction and how this impacts the #smear campaign.  Do you think the Koch forks are happy today?  Today's news in a way validates the future of EV's and dropping oil production.
2650 2018-08-13 18:31:52 I love a good oil finish on wood, so much nicer then a modern varnish finish.

I remember my teacher saying '...with oil you touch the wood, with varnish you touch the finish...'.
2651 2018-08-13 18:31:45 I finally got some CBD oil. 
2652 2018-08-13 18:31:43 بهت افتخار کردم لعنتی دوس داشتنی من 
2653 2018-08-13 18:31:42 Sauve, but like an Avocado and Olive Oil scent instead of my usual Cucumber & Melon or Shea Butter scwnts that I know I'm not allergic too. It smelled fine when I test sniffed it at the store, but on my head it makes my nose burn like Axe products or lavender scents.
2654 2018-08-13 18:31:23 I am not pro using palm oil, I was just naming a few points that makes palm oil attractive for the industry. 
Personally I avoid it as mich as I can.
2655 2018-08-13 18:31:20 You are missing out. It is just a batter baked in oil in oven
2656 2018-08-13 18:31:19 Oil is drunk.
2657 2018-08-13 18:31:18 I'm not a troll. There's a picture of my face and my name in my Twitter account. You are the one spreading half truths hidding behind a nickname. Palm oil industry is far from perfect, but palm oil is the less pollutant and land demanding of all the vegetable oils
2658 2018-08-13 18:31:18 Use tea tree oil, it dries the part of the skin and gets rid of them, they even use it to help get rid of skin tags 
2659 2018-08-13 18:31:06 Students! Get your tickets for Friday’s football game in the athletic office for $10 ($13 at the gate) and sign up to ride the fan bus to the game at Lucas Oil. First 50 students to sign up get to ride for free thanks to Student Gov.!
2660 2018-08-13 18:30:51 As far as I know, we Venezuelans have been received very well here. Specially in the oil industry. And we are thankful.
2661 2018-08-13 18:30:49 IIRC, once customers got used to a lower fat product, widespread corn oil extraction expanded the DDGS market by making it more stable for voyages across the big blue sea and storage in hotter, humid climates. Does that sound right?
2662 2018-08-13 18:30:48 Police yesterday found a man attached to the side of an oil tanker. It's reported that he was a shipping magnet.
2663 2018-08-13 18:30:39 They lowered there consumption of oil from russia to 40% meaning they get the rest elsewhere & russia only accounts for 20% of over import for power production in general. Still have other sanctions on russia. Who said they have to cut of completely, do u know what sanctions are?
2664 2018-08-13 18:30:35 Let’s say the best thing to happen in the West, & the worse thing to happen to tyrants of the Middle East, in the last 50 years for geo-Political considerations: Fracking. America how exports more oil than it imports, which is the single greatest hardly known news story.
2665 2018-08-13 18:30:30 2.55 here, keeping the  oil field worker's busy

Sparkling Mint Blossom w/tea tree oil?
2670 2018-08-13 18:29:41 I like "oil of every pearl's un-insides" better as a bunch of weird words than as a bad pun
2671 2018-08-13 18:29:39 Step 1. Reduce US investments, Step 2. Start trading your oil no longer in Dollars, and as 1 of the biggest oil producers in the world that is a major problem for the US.
2672 2018-08-13 18:29:30 Go to valvoline. They do oil changes on the spot usually and are quick
2673 2018-08-13 18:28:55 its fucking olive oil, balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper, can you not mix shit together?
2674 2018-08-13 18:28:55 OIL monster bounce.  Not the slightest bit surprised fabricated take down after fabricated take down.  Rich get richer with every shakeout
2675 2018-08-13 18:28:38 Wow we lose 25 orangutans every day!!!!!! Please stop buying products with palm oil!
2676 2018-08-13 18:28:34 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
2677 2018-08-13 18:28:16 It's literally only ever the two of you making posts supporting Saudi Arabia. Can they only afford two propaganda bots? With all that oil money?
2678 2018-08-13 18:27:50 Everyone in Lagos is always angry. Even when they're smiling
2679 2018-08-13 18:27:34 Oh no, what are we gonna do without the neolibs “””on our side”””
2680 2018-08-13 18:27:33 Your tax dollars at work.  Soy/corn heavily subsidized.  Corn oil, soybean oil, ethanol....complete boondoggles and trash for both humans and planet.
2681 2018-08-13 18:27:30 Ifs that so you can steal their Oil & Gas
2682 2018-08-13 18:27:21 All spokies (pidis) have become eccentric! Need this oil!
2683 2018-08-13 18:27:16 The USSR could have easily had a resource economy.They had every resource on the planet.Grain in Ukraine,Wine in Georgia,vast vast mineral reserves in Siberia and oil in the caucuses

The USSR millitary industrial complex had grown too strong and sucked in far too much resources
2684 2018-08-13 18:27:16 Tesla supporters say big oil wants to kill the company. Now Elon Musk is seeking a bailout from the Saudis... So is Musk sending Tesla to its grave, or is this irony at its finest? $tsla
2685 2018-08-13 18:27:15 Baby oil. Takes seconds.
2686 2018-08-13 18:27:03 Very good question?   When?  Because for the past two years the squeaky wheels in Washington have not been getting the oil.
2687 2018-08-13 18:26:56 First I browned spicy chicken sausages, onions, chorizo, and added cumin, soy sauce, Chile oil. Then edamame+thin green beans. Steamed flatbread on top of mixture and served together. I would have rolled but there was falling apart Involved. It was so good!
2688 2018-08-13 18:26:54 Hey @GuyAdami how come you didn’t address the fact China dropped the 25% tariff on us oil this morning on money morning on @kfi? Usually love hearing your advice but felt bummed that you guys won’t talk about it. How about a shout out to Bloomington Ca next time with @jjlkfi
2689 2018-08-13 18:26:43 kalo buat bersihin   make up sih mantulan oil cleanser.

2691 2018-08-13 18:26:27 RT @AspiringOne: @WholeFoods Please offer a #SaladBar with NO CANOLA OIL in prepared foods! There is no reason for it, since shelf stability isn’t a factor! #CanolaOil #HeartHealth #lowsodium please as well! #WholeFoods #WFM #561 #WestPalm #PalmBeach #PBG
2692 2018-08-13 18:26:20 And spring is coming. Whenever it is hot you’d swear I was swimming in oil.
2693 2018-08-13 18:26:14 I have max strength cold capsules and olbas oil too and been resting Jill x
2694 2018-08-13 18:26:10 Olive.... legit though... wet your face with warm water, rub a lil oil in your hands and then on your face, wash with a damp warm wash cloth  also the best makeup remover!
2695 2018-08-13 18:25:49 As a clevelander who was at the game last nite, I’m reminded of Oil Can Boyd’s comments while being dogged out aga may the Indians on the shores of Lael Erie: that’s why you don’t build stadiums on the ocean (paraphrase)
2696 2018-08-13 18:25:43 This redneck has five academic degrees, shoots guns, does lawn work, and can write a U.S. Supreme Court appeal's brief. Right now, I'm changing oil in my car. Any questions?

2699 2018-08-13 18:24:56 What is the framework to identify a genuine trader and how do you ensure fund is applied towards working capital funding. Seems like an election largesse to me....far more effective ways to oil the economy
2700 2018-08-13 18:24:54 Camp quote of the day: 
me to 9 y/o: Notice anything different about me?
9 y/o: Yeah! Your hair is a mess and you got a nose piercing. Seriously, Ms. Emily, use some hair oil or something. I got some lotion you could use.
2701 2018-08-13 18:24:54 @nursechevcaddy Terrible service. 3 hour oil change. Paid for services I didn’t receive. Asked at checkout why my car was still dirty. Wash broken, can’t do it but you still have to pay. Service manager said to an employee “just spray it with a hose” right in front of me. So bad
2702 2018-08-13 18:24:49 "Thirty years from now there will be a huge amount of oil - and no buyers. Oil will be left in the ground. The Stone Age came to an end, not because we had a lack of stones, and the oil age will come to an end not because we have a lack of oil."
-- Sheikh Yamani
2703 2018-08-13 18:24:22 I’ve come to the realization that no amount of coconut oil is going to fix my life
2704 2018-08-13 18:24:15 black seed oil eases it a lot. but one should take it regularly. May God help you .
2705 2018-08-13 18:24:04 Nothing but i use black Castro oil 
2706 2018-08-13 18:23:50 Someone pls explain to me why I refuse to pay for an oil change but I plan on blowing so much money this weekend on clothes & jewelry
2707 2018-08-13 18:23:34 $CL_F looking for a pullback to buy... thanks for leaving me out of the $1 run, oil - @$&@*%#!!
2708 2018-08-13 18:23:34 Westminster has taken 92% of scots oil revenues for decades and still managed to near bankrupt an oil rich UK.
UK has had its chance and blew it.
They treat scots like a colony
We can do & deserve better
2709 2018-08-13 18:23:31 Don’t forget to let them know the risk involved in it also. If they don’t do it well,you all keep beating round the bush. If ur head has good oil,u could make 500k monthly. Cheers to my fellow trader . But watch out more importantly 4d risk 
2710 2018-08-13 18:23:27 もっとひどくても皆静かに修正を待つユーザーたちだから・・・
2711 2018-08-13 18:23:21 No longer surprised that gold behaves diff from other safety plays. Oil, the level I'm watching is $64. We can go there,& the pictures remains unchanged. I believe Kibsgaard's call that supplies will be constrained moving forward. This is unwelcome dollar strength.
2712 2018-08-13 18:23:13 So twice as much vegetable oil? 
2713 2018-08-13 18:23:12 I'm inspired to make my own chili oil, thank you!  Lately I've been rifling through jars of store-bought lao gan ma and seriously cannot get enough.  Love that stuff.
2714 2018-08-13 18:23:10 Need to oil Mother soon. Get all the hard-to-reach places.
2715 2018-08-13 18:23:06 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
2716 2018-08-13 18:23:05 There is no better life teacher than experience! the good the bad and the ugly are such a good lesson about knowing who you should and shouldn't engage your energy with. No matter how hard you try oil and water don't mix. Secure your wave not everyone can ride it 
2717 2018-08-13 18:23:03 Bitches be thinking they sooo smart whole time they car bout to blow up because they don’t know how to put oil in it. Bitch fuck you.
2718 2018-08-13 18:23:03 OTHER USES 
•Detoxifying bath – Add ¼ cup of clay to your bath water along with some lavender essential oil for a relaxing and detoxifying bath that will leave your skin smooth and refreshed
2719 2018-08-13 18:22:56 I wash twice a week. A whole wash day with deep conditioning and detangling. And the other is just to add moisture. I twist it in sections with coconut oil and basing with mpl oil. When I style I spray with water and Olive oil
2720 2018-08-13 18:22:46 The west already fund Saudis by buying trillions worth of oil from them. BTW, under current crown prince MBS, Saudi Arabia has been moving away from radical islam and more into modernization. No country is perfect. USA has engaged in wars and killed thousands of innocent lives.
2721 2018-08-13 18:22:38 I don’t want to be a conspiracy theorist. But I believe about 10 % of the Calories in our diet is Soybean Oil High in O6.
2722 2018-08-13 18:22:36 このゲームこのくらいではお祭りにならないから…
2723 2018-08-13 18:22:24 Hahaha no abeg.. i dont like the oil mixing in my garri
2724 2018-08-13 18:22:14 So I bought a new brand of oregano oil and when I tell you that thang almost cleansed my ear wax out. LAWD it was strong.

2727 2018-08-13 18:21:35

2730 2018-08-13 18:21:22 By the by, I saw a programme showing how a doctor in Scotland devised a urine test predicting heart disease more reliably than cholesterol tests. They then had subjects take 20ml of various oils for 6 weeks, and olive oil lowered the HD indicators! Rapeseed etc didn’t touch sides
2731 2018-08-13 18:21:19 All this oyibo chidren...... Fork and spoon?

This totally an only spoon meal.

The slight waging of oil into the garri is to die for

2733 2018-08-13 18:21:13 CBD Oil = Liquid Gold! 
2734 2018-08-13 18:21:12 But you did state that we would just buy oil from other countries.  How is that not clear?  You would rather import oil than use our own.
2735 2018-08-13 18:21:10 Oil city
2736 2018-08-13 18:20:59 he did this a month or so ago with imports exports of oil; iirc, took total us productions as the amt we export, or some other equally idiotic blunder
2737 2018-08-13 18:20:39 That's good oil right there
2738 2018-08-13 18:20:37 I do agree that they are probably hedging their bets in the way of oil becoming outdated at a later time. But the Optics just don't look good
2739 2018-08-13 18:20:16 It's a light sauce. Vegetable stock base, salt, pepper, Olive oil, onion powder (didn't feel like cutting an onion), oregano, and some fresh cilantro. The sausages were cooked in some Amber ale before they were added
2740 2018-08-13 18:20:13 we keep passing mini pumpjacks

who is putting these tiny tiny oil pumps all over the south plains
2741 2018-08-13 18:19:58 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
2742 2018-08-13 18:19:57 For sure! It’s like cleaning up an oil slick, too!
2743 2018-08-13 18:19:45 Hyped for the new skins, Thresh looks sick, Urgot looks like a steampunk oil baron.
2744 2018-08-13 18:19:43 100% on your view

Calling out @saudiarabia for what they are on Twitter might not have been smartest or best strategic move but it certainly caught their attention.

Facts are facts and human rights are HR’s 

I am all for boycotting Saudi oil in favour of Canadian crude
2745 2018-08-13 18:19:30 HISTORIC rainfall in Houston, and all over the place, including the fully loaded ships at sea, Oil prices are too high, OPEC is at it again, this time trying to negotiate a long overdue.
2746 2018-08-13 18:19:22 Curious, how do you propose we heat our homes and run our cars and industry?  We should be developing Canadian oil and gas, we can demand rigorous environmental protections if it is on our soil.  If we continue to import Saudi oil we have no voice.

2748 2018-08-13 18:19:11 Ah, but what kind, is it good oil like Norway, or the oil that would be a hindrance to Scottish independence :-)

2751 2018-08-13 18:18:55 I got my debit card blocked cause I didn’t know what this random charge was... welllll I forgot I got an oil change over the weekend 
2752 2018-08-13 18:18:48 #nkebeeseka caster oil and spait I would've had I would have gotten a scholarship from Washington DC in second grade.
2753 2018-08-13 18:18:46 yeah, and the different way Oil acts vs. Gold.  If there was a global crisis brewing, wouldn't oil be going down (1997-98 & 2014-15) and gold be ripping?
2754 2018-08-13 18:18:44 ain’t you got an oil change to do or sum @ lanzone
2755 2018-08-13 18:18:36 a little progress in packaging and delivery of snake oil. But it you count oils from insects mammals vegetable and fossils you have the pill industry which is the single largest advance in medical science in the last 100 years.
2756 2018-08-13 18:18:26 Had our oil heater annually serviced and hung out with the dude for 3 hours talking about the grossest houses he’s ever been in. Basically sounded like he’s been on tour with me my whole life 
2757 2018-08-13 18:18:09 Thanks Alfred. I think it should come up quite nicely when it's had a few coats of oil.
2758 2018-08-13 18:18:05 There's an old Saudi saying 'my grandfather rode a camel, I ride in a private jet, my grandson will ride a camel' - they know their oil fields are rapidly depleting; this is smart on the part of the Saudis.  One wonders why Tesla needs the money, though.
2759 2018-08-13 18:18:04 They won't own Tesla, nor even a controlling share. However horrific they are, at least they are moving away from oil. We can't ignore the guys we don't like when it comes to climate change.
2760 2018-08-13 18:17:54 $CRC added to long positions at $32.10  remember these guys get Brent pricing, not WTI.  Cali has no pipelines to mid continent US. Minimal comes on train.  The oil is local or comes in on tankers.
2761 2018-08-13 18:17:46 MI5 rigged it George They wanted the oil and the Yanks didn't want to loose the cheap storage of 220 nukes Better together eh
2762 2018-08-13 18:17:32 Oil of the Lord x Kevin Lemons is one of my favorite worship songs
2763 2018-08-13 18:17:22 when ur check engine light has been on for two months and ur just now getting an oil change

2766 2018-08-13 18:17:09 Can someone explain to me why I’m nervous while getting my first oil change by myself? Like what? Adulting is hard
2767 2018-08-13 18:16:58 I like coconut oil but I can't take the smell of it in my hair by itself gotta dilute
2768 2018-08-13 18:16:57 Ooh sorry I don’t cheat and use tanning oil
2769 2018-08-13 18:16:56 do you double cleanse? try an astringent after you cleanse and it should clear up slowly it’s just oil build up the most oil is produced on your nose
2770 2018-08-13 18:16:50 @cf72 The Duke is a well oil machine!
2771 2018-08-13 18:16:44 @cnbc Oil Prices in for a spike: New Iran Sanctions, Saudi Production reportedly down last month and conflict risk in the Strait of Hormuz weighting on future Oil prices.
2772 2018-08-13 18:16:39 Does anyone else think it odd that a country that survives on oil sales would take an interest in Tesla?
2773 2018-08-13 18:16:06 Yes exactly, I kinda like have a dipstick motion goin on, kinda like when you check your oil
2774 2018-08-13 18:16:01 One of my tweets went missing?
In reply to Stuhnffc: Cool, we'll keep our oil, gas, energy, water, fishing waters (we'll also be having that 1990's territorial water grab reversed). And although it's not strictly ours, you can keep the £13bn deficit and rusty subs for the Thames.
2775 2018-08-13 18:15:51 On oil?
2776 2018-08-13 18:15:23 I fucking love sesame oil 
2777 2018-08-13 18:15:18 i use my rosehip oil for scars that’s honestly what cleared up all my acne scars
2778 2018-08-13 18:15:16 Erdogan's nephew was profiting from IS oil smuggling; Erdogan himself set Islamicist thugs on Kurdish dissidents. The sooner he loses office, the better #C4News
2779 2018-08-13 18:15:14 That is strange.  Yrs ago when I was a junkyard rat you’d see lots of cars died due to poor maintenance, unscrew the oil filler and look inside.  Rockers caked in thick oil residue.
2780 2018-08-13 18:15:10 We're run by OIL!!! It's an OIL company with an army and they are creating havoc on all fronts!!!!! And the DNC is a contributor, an accomplice that is helping our world to become a burnt black dead sphere.
2781 2018-08-13 18:14:56 I needa go get an oil change
2782 2018-08-13 18:14:54 Which is why you support ending the multi-billion subsidies to oil companies, right? No more political clienteles!
2783 2018-08-13 18:14:48 But I use 100% tea tree essential oil diluted with water. Like a 1:5 mixture in a bottle then apply it with a cotton pad or a tip a couple times a day. You should always moisturize after tol

2791 2018-08-13 18:14:06 "The nastiest and grooviest things in the world cannot be pursued or even pursued - they must be washed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
2792 2018-08-13 18:14:01 Thats what they say but it doesnt make it true. Solar/Electric is a dime to Oil’s Dollars. They will go w/the bigger $ every time. Prediction: If this deal goes through w/i 5 years @Tesla no longer exists & @elonmusk becomes a minor footnote of history. [I hope I am wrong.]
2793 2018-08-13 18:14:00 BTW NEVER PUTTING OIL IN MY HAIR AGAIN, Y'ALL CAN 4GET IT LOL
2794 2018-08-13 18:13:42 Saudis make their money off oil.  Invest in Tesla to kill it?
2795 2018-08-13 18:13:37 You shouldn’t use empty olive oil bottles for your Fairy Liquid
2796 2018-08-13 18:13:31 why would an ancient deer-like animal want to evolve into a whale, much less one whose body is full of oil
2797 2018-08-13 18:13:23 Non of our business, maybe the oil will make them win the league 
2798 2018-08-13 18:13:15 i’m getting my car oil changed and they’re playing love story... i swear taylor stalks me in every public place
2799 2018-08-13 18:13:13 Plenty of countries have stood and said far more about Saudi human rights, and the jailing of Raif in the last few years - they're just cowed bc they want Saudi oil. If Saudi wants to hurt students by refusing to allow them to learn here, that is regretable but not a crisis.
2800 2018-08-13 18:13:10 maybe if you are afraid of putting the oil pastels in the buildings just color behind them and leave the buildings and flowers black and white and it is beautiful btw!

I can wear Fenty after I’ve moisturized (and put a spritz if Rose water)So will the cake mix, oil and flour settle okay on my skin? I’d hate to not like something from y’all bc I LUV the lip whips
2803 2018-08-13 18:12:55 Queen, I use it on my body & cooking I feel 100 percent when. I made to switch from vegetable oil#unity#blessings
2804 2018-08-13 18:12:51 Lavender oil on the spine is great for bed pain, but you’re right it’s also a great carrier oil.

Would you be interested to collaborate, please get in touch
2808 2018-08-13 18:11:59 @Wendys in #RVA, while waiting to get your boy's oil changed is the best place to write rap songs and poetry
2809 2018-08-13 18:11:55 "It is not a text to cause commotion. It is pure pragmatism."

But what are You doing? 
Your party blow up the oil plant, burn the crude oil tanker and shake gasoline market price.
Is it for your friend's investor?
2810 2018-08-13 18:11:46 If @Myshield has 1bill tokens at 0.11 cents then yes #TSI is undervalued massively.

2811 2018-08-13 18:11:42 what to not do:

- don’t stress
- don’t wear too much makeup or any makeup 
- don’t touch face 
- don’t forget to exfoliate 
- cut out sugar, oil and salt from your eating habits 
- don’t pig out on junk food, you’ll get A LOT of pimples in a single day (I have experience smh)
2812 2018-08-13 18:11:23 #RT @SexAdviceBot: US DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH: Often use an essential oil.
2813 2018-08-13 18:11:12 ...and this will last forever? Man is at last trying to phase oil out also! The United Kingdom is the greatest union in the world, the EU will take everything OFF YOU!
2814 2018-08-13 18:11:10 Sad but true. Every time I hear them drop a new "enemy" name on the attack list, I immediately think, "Uh oh, what did they find? Oil? Gold? Some other natural resource?"
2815 2018-08-13 18:11:05 Oil on canvas,  very well done
2816 2018-08-13 18:11:00 Nope. I adopted a whole food plant based no added oil diet . Engine 2 Seven Day Rescue diet is all you need to turn your health around!! #E27DR

2826 2018-08-13 18:09:59 @jecarter13 have a feeling #TSI will rerate soon. Extremely undervalued, 0.25 is looking like history as there's none available at this price. Onwards to 0.3-0.4 soon.

2833 2018-08-13 18:08:43 They should always have both! People have different skin types and should be able to find a finish that works for them. I couldn’t find anything other than matte for a few years and it was annoying lol I had to slather oil all over my face as primer and mix it in the makeup too
2834 2018-08-13 18:08:36 bbc news Scotland tonight had the lot for Unionists, GSTQ, Union Jack, British this and British that and then the wee cherry on the pie - dwindling north sea oil the apparently reached it peak in the late 90s.
2835 2018-08-13 18:08:35 Car feeling great after that oil change
2836 2018-08-13 18:08:24 I wanted to see when the middle east country stop selling oil to the united states
2837 2018-08-13 18:08:22 I need a oil change and my brakes changed ... I need a sugar daddy 
2838 2018-08-13 18:08:21 One thing that stands out to me that is like oil and gas is as you move to smarter applications, whether its IoT, AVs or similar, you have more comunications across the network and more potentially vulnerable consumer info which is a separate cyber issue from operational risks.
2839 2018-08-13 18:08:14  tesla might be having a deal with oil rich nation how’s the hypocrisy 
2840 2018-08-13 18:08:12 Is the US obligated to keep paying into this? Where are your arab brothers? They've got lots of oil money....

2846 2018-08-13 18:07:25 I just did oregano oil and echinacea this morning.
2847 2018-08-13 18:07:18 @OssiningPDChief I'm from FiOS1 News.  Are you there to update us on the oil spill?
2848 2018-08-13 18:07:13 Cool, ok, we'll give you no oil, gas, energy, water or fishing rights.  You can also have your £13bn deficit.  Cheerio!
2849 2018-08-13 18:07:10 Going through 4 pails of oil a day
2850 2018-08-13 18:07:08 I am a robot. I piss oil
2851 2018-08-13 18:06:53 Tea tree oil has never made me breakout and my skin only gets dry if I’m applying it more than 3 times a day which I have been lately to purposely dry out my acne
2852 2018-08-13 18:06:52 As in the actual colour or how it was made? Colour wise it's Mournfang, nuln oil then Gorthor brown.
2853 2018-08-13 18:06:47 Gonna ship him so coconut and jojoba oil and pray 
2854 2018-08-13 18:06:35 Does mean Irving Oil does Not receive anymore oil from Saudi Arabia. Canada needs a pipeline from Alberta to Nova Scotia, to supply oil for the refinery.
2855 2018-08-13 18:06:32 like this if you would go to a restaurant that just served 10 different courses of bread and oil
2856 2018-08-13 18:06:24 Engano seu, mudou de nome e está aí. Ipiranga é o nome. A Standart Oil tem seu laranja na direção.

2860 2018-08-13 18:06:00 @Tesco why do you have to use palm oil in your Tuna Crunch subs (and potentially more items) disappoints me every time I see it in the ingredients! Think of all those poor animals! #SayNoToPalmOil (I hear Iceland is removing palm oil from all their products too! )
2861 2018-08-13 18:05:59 Maybe he Was made in hot oil, maybe he Was jelly, we probably will never know
2862 2018-08-13 18:05:53 In addition, to keeping the #financial channel open, the #Europeans (@EU_Commission @eu_eeas) need to ensure that #Iran’s #oil exports revenues are reasonable and accessible (the latter the @ecb can help with).
2863 2018-08-13 18:05:34 休めてねーーーーよ
2864 2018-08-13 18:05:31 lotta oil in Niger
2865 2018-08-13 18:05:30 I'd walk away too. Arguing about an array of meats can be time consuming plus the fact of dipping and not frying in provided oil could make this thread drag right on.

"No sauce on the bacon love and brown on the sausage, rocket and olive."
2866 2018-08-13 18:05:29 I wash my hair every two weeks cos i normally have cornrows on.. use black soap as shampoo, condition after and apply shea butter and Jamaican black castor oil

2868 2018-08-13 18:05:24 Wish we'd just admit that we don't know what we're doing in the middle East and just get the fuck out.

All the more reason to invest in renewables too so we can stop sucking the Saudi's dicks for oil.
2869 2018-08-13 18:05:15 And again this isn’t even about the anointing oil, this is God saying I’ll still be gracious and merciful to you no matter the situation whether a true believer or not. I know you think being a Christian sucks but damn that’s the most beautiful thing you can ever imagine 
2870 2018-08-13 18:05:14 We don't need more faulty pipelines, especially from Enron of all corporations. It would have been so much better for Canada if we had made a refinery here. Our dirty oil has to be sold at discount prices but if we cleaned it here, we could sell it at full price
2871 2018-08-13 18:05:09 In a collaboration with Imagination, Display Group was tasked with creating this 10’ diameter 3-D oil refinery.  Combining our 3-D routing and printing capabilities, Display Group was able to deliver this to scale model.
2872 2018-08-13 18:05:00 No! If it’s been oiled/Factory finished before it won’t take a dark oil properly. I believe that the darker issue HM/Vitra pieces have a spray stain/application from fresh timber which can’t be replicated well at home.
2873 2018-08-13 18:04:57 I’m going on what Todd Howard said he only speaks facts and about oil
2874 2018-08-13 18:04:57 We should start at home by banning zoos. AnimaLs kept in cages no matter how big are still captive. Governments only interested in Countries with oil, They could gaf about Rainforrests going etc

2887 2018-08-13 18:03:50 Crude oil beyond $80 will be a challenge. Things can go bit haywire in the short-term. Hope oil is capped at $80. Chances of oil price coming down is bright which can help stabilize Rupee. Let's keep fingers crossed.

2900 2018-08-13 18:02:27 I got the dark and lovely au natural shampoo conditioner and moisturizing pudding(this stuff smells amazing). I use a concuct of Paul Mitchell detangling spray , avocado oil, amla oil, castor oil, almond oil and a hint of lavender for the smell as a styling spray
2901 2018-08-13 18:02:15 That's right Chuck, not to mention the energy & resources it takes to produce the batteries vs. oil to gas. And for people like me who buy something they really like & keep it a while, replacement batteries are almost like buying a new transmission. Won't say that either.
2902 2018-08-13 18:01:58 Also roasted kale with a lil olive oil and dried chilli is outstanding.
2903 2018-08-13 18:01:43 Yes I chopped it last August. Since I'm in high school and can't afford these expensive natural hair products I use petroleum jelly, Hairfood that contains Amla or Coconut oil and Dark and  Lovely moisturizer with the 5 uses. Surprisingly these actually worked.

2916 2018-08-13 18:00:16 Exactly why I'm holding back on buying even though these prices are tempting. I don't believe the growth narrative & think a lot of Q2 growth was due to a rush to avoid sanctions. Long term bullish, but worried that oil and O&G equities will be dragged lower if market corrects.

2925 2018-08-13 17:59:03 The problem is the petrodollar, the mechanism that allows the Federal gov to ignore its ever increasing debt. As a people we can survive without Saudi oil. The most corrupt aspect of the Federal gov cannot. Have no doubt they'd start a World War just to keep us hook on Saudi oil.

2937 2018-08-13 17:58:06 Saudi and Qatar are also two of the most important and largest investors in alternative energy... this is consistent with the investment storyline they've shared with partners for years: that oil is simply the first of their many successful energy investments.

2988 2018-08-13 17:52:20 So if you need to cram a powerplant into a submarine with highly limited space and the need to stay at sea for years without refueling, the enormous cost of a reactor is worthwhile.  On land, with plenty of space and oil plentiful, it's inefficient.

3000 2018-08-13 17:51:15 It's also an argument about short term influence, which isn't really compelling. The long term influence problem could be worse. Why wouldn't Saudi Arabia try to impede Musk from disrupting the global auto industry? They want to sell oil for as long as they can.

3010 2018-08-13 17:50:06 Saudi’s and Tesla love story. 

Elon wants to infuse $ into Tesla and keep market share which is what saudi’s want by playing their cards right to boost the next oil of the century. 

Its an arranged marriage.

3012 2018-08-13 17:50:04 I have to say, I'm extremely disappointed that @elonmusk would consider taking Tesla private using Saudi money. #1 producer of oil who has -0- interest in sustainable energy would all of a sudden have the largest stake in Tesla and its mission for sustainable energy!? #WrongBuyer

There's no one who sustains Israel's land theft & oppression more than the House of Saud &  Netanyahu's favourite Oil Prince Bin Salman.

Maybe save your ire for the Gulf monarchies desperate for Israeli friendship

3030 2018-08-13 17:48:31 Jojoba oil is a known oil for skin since it’s said to be closest to our sebum makeup, but it can be a little pricy. If you go to TJ Maxx or Ross, you’ll find oils for the LOW! if you can, use rose hip SEED oil as it’s more effective than rose hip oil (I believe with scarring)
3031 2018-08-13 17:48:30 When we see changes we will stop the generalization but for now ,We are in a DEEP MESS! However I believe in Naija  same way. If Dubai of today can transform their country with just Oil . What wrong with naija Oil? Na groundnut oil be our own?

3049 2018-08-13 17:46:15 I agree that fossil fuels are the past and yes, I let my many donations speak for me as an individual. The question you need to ask is, why would big Oil be eager to donate to our party? Our positions regarding energy extraction are widely known.
3050 2018-08-13 17:46:13 Oh wait, no, theyll still take oil money AND co-opt green energy

3052 2018-08-13 17:45:59 I agree... the Saudi’s will be aware oil is finite. They need to get in on the next thing. With the money they have I think it could be good. Just hope EM can help with their humanitarian record in return. #JustSaying

3056 2018-08-13 17:45:26 Your arguments make absolutely no sense. You said that palm oil is bad because of palmitic acid. I told you that palmitic acid is everywhere. And your answer is that palm oil should be labeled an banned.

3074 2018-08-13 17:42:46 Yes I know what apartheid is. Israel is murdering unarmed civilians stealing land daily forcing Palestinians out of their homes and bulldozers flattening them for more settlements. Stealing oil and minerals. I know what an apartheid state is. Israel.

3105 2018-08-13 17:39:48 Yes, that's exactly the point. Lowest cost producer, but unfortunately the economy needs a much higher oil price. That might be their strategy,  but it's only benefiting the Americans it seems.

3110 2018-08-13 17:39:33 I need to get better at frying things besides pierogi, though.  Apparently I can use a deep-frier reasonably successfully to make paczki, but even that was tricky, and I just have no sense of how hot to have oil be or how to tell if it is hot enough.
3111 2018-08-13 17:39:28 This is a win-win for Saudi Arabia. If they invest and Tesla takes over the world, they win. If Tesla (and the dream of EVS) dies on the vine due, its oil interests are that much more VALUABLE.
3112 2018-08-13 17:39:27 Why was I out here thinking an oil change was $15...

3114 2018-08-13 17:39:15 I didn’t accuse him of corruption, someone else did. And there have been enough malpractices in the oil and gas sector during his time. I know enough people to say this with conviction. Have a high regard for you so won’t go there. Though that last bit was petty.

This is super fun to watch.
3121 2018-08-13 17:38:40 Dawg, I can't help you, cause I've been trying to figure out the same. Motor oil is the only one i know that turns that black. So maybe

3126 2018-08-13 17:37:42 On the other hand, the GCC countries have bigger risks with higher dollar. They are going to suffer because of dollar peg.

3135 2018-08-13 17:37:00 Why exactly? How’s the gender quotas in the mining community?, the hazardous waste industry? The oil wells? Among national school teachers?
3136 2018-08-13 17:36:57 I assume every geographical grids on this globe has its own variant of oil or ghee, favorable to that particular climate n human civilization. May it be sesame or coconut or olive, all r best in their own produce lands. Why get biased with any
3137 2018-08-13 17:36:51 More like they want the next factory in Saudi Arabia. The US doesn't control battery prices like they do with oil.i think they want to be energy independent from US price fixing
3138 2018-08-13 17:36:50 This mosquito is an opportunistic little bug, waited for the lavender oil to wear off early this morning and got me in the chin! At least I've been sleeping really well. That's a miracle.
3139 2018-08-13 17:36:47 Lunchbox, learn how to do the oil change yourself! It’s pretty easy and it takes 15min! #Oilchange #Nowaittime #Easysavings
3140 2018-08-13 17:36:46 I thought E was fat soluble as well which is why you’re supposed to feed it with an oil if not feeding a liquid form? But yea you’d have to feed a ton I think to get it up there
3141 2018-08-13 17:36:35 It made me feel like my stop has been set too tight on oil. Which has been a major problem for me this last year. Now looking at my chart you can probably understand my strategies. Taking entries on pops and closes above and below the 5. Sto, RSI, BB oscillators for good measure.
3142 2018-08-13 17:36:34 i got my cartilage pierced literally a year ago and it’s still not healed. like it’s still swollen n red and there’s a bump on the hole on the front and the back and yes i’ve tried tea tree oil and sea salt but nothing works. pls help
3143 2018-08-13 17:36:25 @elonmusk Having been to Oslo in May & my daughter just there, I would include Norway’s Sovereign Wealth Fund in Tesla’s take private venture. It is the Worlds largest Sovereign Fund, it has underperformed and it is divesting oil & gas. Tesla’s are loved throughout Scandinavia!
3144 2018-08-13 17:36:24 It’s a party outside where they throw paint water and oil on you and all people do is wine and dance . There’s probably a reason for it but idk it .
3145 2018-08-13 17:36:11 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
3146 2018-08-13 17:36:02 and now $TSLA is effectively sponsored by Saudi Arabia...evil 'big oil' to the Tesla crowd and one of underminers (UN participation notwithstanding) of the global liberal order.  $TSLA is now an unconscionable investment to it core base and yet...
3147 2018-08-13 17:35:59 As a cashier, I never really judge what people purchase, but I can’t help but wonder what other cashiers think the one time bought a pack of condoms and baby oil
3148 2018-08-13 17:35:56 I’m experiencing it too as we speak, my skins an oil slick, my boobs are excruciating and the ibs is raging as well as my pms, it’s the worst I’ve felt in a long time 
3149 2018-08-13 17:35:42 So..we need a National Energy Program?  The free market controls the oil once it leaves the ground. We can't change that without taking drastic measures.
3150 2018-08-13 17:35:37 Thirty years from now there will be a huge amount of oil - and no buyers. Oil will be left in the ground. The Stone Age came to an end, not because we had a lack of stones, and the oil age will come to an end not because we have a lack of oil.

3151 2018-08-13 17:35:32 @DrOz I do enjoy Oz. med and discussion of herbs "branch into growing" and the overwhelming amount of new info, olive oil fraud? Organic fraud? The slaughter of an animal is time to change the channel

3154 2018-08-13 17:35:18 They were kidnapping Black men through the 50s and 60s and pinning fake charges on them so they could lease them to the state's oil mines and fields. I don't think this is included in history books, though.

3157 2018-08-13 17:35:02 Both US and China want a lower $USD. When this thing rolls over (Trade Agreement in August) inflation trades will explode... Gold, Silver, Copper, Oil, AUD, NZD, CAD. Now is the time to load that boat.

3163 2018-08-13 17:34:08 The interesting thing about this dollar bull run is that if oil tanks back to $50, India shouldn't notice massive direct and immediate impact. Only the Indian companies that have borrowed in dollars need to worry. That might impact the economy and job market little later.
3164 2018-08-13 17:34:02 Do you mean the oil figures ?  No problem ,we got 200 million pounds from oil , we received 13,000 million pounds from Barnett . We spent 12,700 million on health in Scotland so in fact Barnett could have paid for all our health budget . Pooling and sharing Annie , 
3165 2018-08-13 17:34:01 There`s even a bowl of oil to dip the fucking shit into, like that`s going to bring the fucking flavour out. Just going to make it greasy
3166 2018-08-13 17:33:47 Mountain pipeline to Vancouver project need to be expedited
for self sufficiency on our energy need and thus no need to buy Saudi oil...
Doubt keystones pipeline project will be implemented; the energy security of NA.
3167 2018-08-13 17:33:38 Mike the low grade we buy now from foreign why??? I realize some hate things moving forward, if u think oil at some point will be eliminated, Not going to happen not in this next 3 centuries
3168 2018-08-13 17:33:36 Getting an oil change then I’m free
3169 2018-08-13 17:33:34 im getting an oil change & I can’t wait for them to charge like $600 because I don’t know any better they’ll be like “your left scoreboard carburetor is broken” and I’ll be like dammmmn rlly
3170 2018-08-13 17:33:17 When u take ur car in for an oil change and 3 ur tires have bubbles cost u 1,300$ wtf
3171 2018-08-13 17:32:52 Well that's something I've never seen before. My bus was a few minutes late and then when it turned up a mechanic guy who was waiting at the stop opened up the back and started replacing water and oil.  Nice work.

3173 2018-08-13 17:32:34 @elonmusk When will @Tesla start building cruise ships, the one from AIDA made the polo shirt of my dirty with its exhausts. cruise ships using heavy oil are a huge climate problem.
3174 2018-08-13 17:32:33 Something about oil down I could eat everyday 
3175 2018-08-13 17:32:32 I just tried to post some excellent studies and articles on Cbc oil for cardio issues. Do not stop at whatever you heard. Please research it dear you will be informed and blessed and encouraged.
3176 2018-08-13 17:32:25 ...ไม่คุยด้วยละ
3177 2018-08-13 17:32:25 I was going to mention the sogginess issue - you really need to squeeze them out. And the oil needs to be piping hot :) :)
3178 2018-08-13 17:32:14 Need to find a big bottle of sweet almond oil

3182 2018-08-13 17:31:36 Katsina People Wicked: They collected Rice, Money and Groundnut Oil from them BUT Voted for PMB's Candidate.
3183 2018-08-13 17:31:12 yup, the essential oil thing is so gross but something about "i contact your dead loved ones, for a price..." just makes me wanna take a baseball bat to them
3184 2018-08-13 17:30:54 If we invested more in renewable energy instead of coal, gas and oil maybe human civilization will have a chance, but I guarantee Koch brothers and Dow chem wont ever allow that as they have bought and paid for the entire Republican party.
3185 2018-08-13 17:30:47 $tsla Guys, Saudi Arabia needs a hedge. If oil goes down, EV will go up. This investment makes enormous sense as a hedge. It's a way to buy insurance for them. They want to IPO aramco for the same reason.  Diversification and risk management.
3186 2018-08-13 17:30:47 Is there a better place to put your oil money than $TSLAQ ? Don't think so.
3187 2018-08-13 17:30:38 Yo @pepboysauto 

When I make an an appointment online for 11 AM, then the appointment should be 11 AM

I shouldn’t be sitting here 1.5 hours later 

All for an oil change.

They are the people who care about the future of all humanity, not just the paychecks of oil patch workers and investors. OSA are financed by International oil industry corps and associations.

3198 2018-08-13 17:29:31 @WholeFoods you took an excellent product that flies off the shelves (#365 #Organic Blue Corn Chips), repackaged & added #CanolaOil to it. Now those who seek #hearthealthy snacks will go elsewhere. PLEASE STOP USING CANOLA OIL in your products AND prepared foods. #NoCanola #WFM
3199 2018-08-13 17:29:30 I know you don’t believe in oils but tea tree oil and lavender behind your ears or on a cotton ball works  $15 at Walmart for both without having to go to the dr or pay for prescriptions...
3200 2018-08-13 17:29:09 The meme- what are the real figures in a daily basis from oil ?
3201 2018-08-13 17:29:03 I use olive oil when I'm playing with my nipples, quite satisfying
3202 2018-08-13 17:29:01 I am VERY ok! I just laugh at people like you that despite ALL the signs and facts pointing out trumps incompetency and corruptness they still support his racist and stupid ideas! In the old days he'd be a snake oil salesman! I hate bullies and all my life have stood up against!
3203 2018-08-13 17:28:53 At my last company we had a member of staff who used her surname as ‘oliveoil’ in her email address at an Olive Oil conference. Hand written. Anyhoo she got exclusively malware to .oliveoil address for a decade, it’s how I found half my original malware at Crabbers.
3204 2018-08-13 17:28:40 Spent a couple of hours on a Millikan oil drop apparatus (prepping for a modern physics lab course) until *finally* realizing that I had to clean a capacitor plate with soapy water since clear (invisible) oil filled the teeny-tiny hole that droplets are supposed to go through.

3207 2018-08-13 17:28:34 Yes I do, & many other spills as well. I've even gone diving around oil platforms to perform plankton counts. Are you saying that because some industries accidentally kill massive amounts of bird life that those like wind turbine companies should be allowed to do it on purpose?
3208 2018-08-13 17:28:33 I’ll give them some praise when they cut Saudi oil from entering our country. Otherwise this is just more virtue signalling bullshit that the @liberal_party have become famous for @gmbutts @JustinTrudeau
3209 2018-08-13 17:28:21 PM HAS PUT QUEBEC's CHEAP OIL SELL TO USA IN JEOPARDY? 
Quebec won't allow PIPELINE through to get oil from Alberta? Oil from Saudia Arabia? Open pocket cheap deal oil feed to USA? wow! 
Hey QUEBEC put the $10+ billion dollars in the end of a pipe and send it back to ALBERTA!
3210 2018-08-13 17:28:20 Watch the sh!t hit the fan at the end of this month with the oil $ price going up and the ZAR falling like a brick. Cat on a hot tin roof.

3213 2018-08-13 17:27:58 Under Mr False integrity Buhari a corrupt minister of petroleum, NNPC claims it lost N111.42 billion worth of crude oil & products in its custody between 2015 - 2017. This is separate from N427 billion it claimed as financial losses incurred at its corporate headquarters alone

Mine has gas plumbing legs in black iron and an oldish tung oil finish.
3223 2018-08-13 17:26:40 I do agree that we need that oil and it's a huge part of global supply. The more they struggle, the better fundamentals get for the bullish thesis, but not sure how they will survive in this environment.
3224 2018-08-13 17:26:38 The oil business is a staple part of our economy today.
3225 2018-08-13 17:26:29 ว่าไงครับ
3226 2018-08-13 17:26:28 If you don't like the flavor try adding a bit of lemon juice and a pinch of black pepper to it, that way you lower the intensity of the oil making it more tolerable
3227 2018-08-13 17:26:17 i love having to wait at least an hour and a half every time i go to pepboys for a simple oil change and tire rotation

3232 2018-08-13 17:25:24 What is the cumulative impact on common man with even a .5% change aka ₹3.x change? Crude oil prices are set to rise further & if ₹ gets weaker then please compute impact per unit change

3243 2018-08-13 17:24:37 I'm a lifelong Democrat who worked for a big oil company. There are thousands of oil employees like me. We are the front line in making sure environmental protections are adhered to. Why does my voice and dollars matter less than other workers?
3244 2018-08-13 17:24:30 Pakistan naturally has abundance of Sunshine. Pakistan should’ve turned to solar energy long long time ago and would’ve not be dependable on oil because it has enough sunshine to be independent of oil. So why NO government had done it.

3253 2018-08-13 17:23:30 There is no "K" in Fracturing we hydraulically fracture Shale/chalk/Marl oil formations, just an FYI
3254 2018-08-13 17:23:29 Other options:
1)brushing with tea-tree essential oil
2)as our ancestors used to do:replace modern toot-brush & dental paste by masticatory woods with cleansing effect for teeth & stimulating effect on gingiva: Acacia catechu,  Amaranthus caudalus,  Burkea africana and much more
3255 2018-08-13 17:22:55 I can't disagree with you on that. Completely agree on that point. Referring more to the oil aspects of things. From my understanding the Saudi economy is not doing good at these prices. Every attempt to get the price higher only plays into the hands of shale.
3256 2018-08-13 17:22:51 Exactly! The US economy is based on two things: OIL and WARS. We go to war for oil and our future generations die for that oil.

3260 2018-08-13 17:22:27 I wouldn't.  Funny, Harley decides to move manufacturing to Europe to avoid his ridiculous tariffs/taxes and they get impugned.  But 10-1 says the Trump admin would happily approve a major car manufacturer being acquired by dirty Saudi oil money. He loves wealth and power.

3266 2018-08-13 17:21:46 Sanction? No? Why are we still buying oil from these vermin?
3267 2018-08-13 17:21:41 Correct, things aren’t looking too good yet for offshore drillers. Still offshore production nearly 30% of global crude oil output. Charts still look bullish and sentiment bad right now, I’m buying more when selling pressure goes away
3268 2018-08-13 17:21:28 @bkosta well the dab rig is of no use. And neither really is your vaporizer. Probably best bet is to mix it with some other weed if you really want to vape. Or make your own moonrock if you have some hash oil (:
3269 2018-08-13 17:21:19 Exactly my point, we don't have oil but we have great tourist destinations. Rwanda is maximising on that, ever heard of competitive advantage?

3273 2018-08-13 17:21:05 I feel sad for you if you believe this. You need to read some more history and find out about true leaders. Your leader follow a snake oil salesmen.

3281 2018-08-13 17:20:31 Rediculous, Charles. I haven't seen anyone "slobbering" over Saudi Arabia, except the Liberals right up until this spat. And that's the point. Cdns have been calling out this devotion to the Saudis & supporting their oil industry forever. Why the sudden attack of conscience now?
3282 2018-08-13 17:20:31 Broccoli, olive oil, garlic and anchovies. Broccoli are steamed then cooked in pan with rest until they break up. Add cooked pasta (short) and cook together couple of minutes (pasta is called arriminata in Sicilian, stirred). We like with fried bread crumbs instead of parmigiano
3283 2018-08-13 17:19:44 Have you ever wondered why Abacha or Chavez didn't really threaten world oil market with either raising or reducing the price of their crude even when OPEC went low on prices to cause some market disruptions, despite sanctions.

3291 2018-08-13 17:18:36 "The typical family would earn $3,000 to $7,000 more a year, the White House Council of Economic Advisers said. In fact, real wages are down, largely thanks to the rising price of oil, which has more than offset any modest increase in income"
3292 2018-08-13 17:18:34 So, let me get this straight. The Saudis approached Musk multiple times about their need to diversify from oil and yet Musk doxxed a guy weeks ago who he believed represented Big Oil and was thus evil?

Sure, Elon. Even he couldn't be *that* dense about other people's perceptions

3300 2018-08-13 17:17:49 Just playing devils advocate here but perhaps getting the largest oil producer in the world to go electric might be of some benefit.
3301 2018-08-13 17:17:25 Infrastructure is the complex foundation on which the world’s economy is built.

Oil and gas power it. Water supply sustains it. Roads and rail move it. Airports and shipping terminals connect it. Information technology networks inform it.

As a nation where do we stand?

3315 2018-08-13 17:15:51 Typically, crude futures trade inversely to the greenback. A stronger dollar makes oil more expensive to much of the world, so oil prices tend to fall as the dollar rises.

3320 2018-08-13 17:15:34 Jeko, you are both wrong. The immigrant analogy is the only way to put a positive spin in a demon invasion, it's like calling a massive oil spill an industrial accident instead of an environmental disaster.
Or, of course, calling illegal aliens "legally challenged".

3344 2018-08-13 17:13:06 He has a valid point. We have enough oil in Alberta to service Canada's needs. We need to stop buying oil from other countries and start utilizing our own resources. Yes, we should invest in clean energy, but for the foreseeable future, oil is going to continue to be a necessity.

3354 2018-08-13 17:11:31 Yeah it was adorable the way Obama let BP destroy my states' ocean ecosystem.

3398 2018-08-13 17:05:57 Aztec healing clay mask is the best I use acv, turmeric, honey & sometimes a lil oil (almond/rosehip). I hear the reason people don’t like it is bc its “drying” which it won’t be if u swap out acv for water also putting honey in it makes it moisturizing when you wash it off (IMO)
3399 2018-08-13 17:05:45 We should keep our oil for our use, sell at cost to Canadians and push renewables in the meantime. Also we should build our own cars and trucks, sell at a 20%over cost and sell the rest for profit for Canada.

3404 2018-08-13 17:04:58 The State of ND doesn't care about anything except keeping the oil & gas revenues coming in. Farmers mean nothing in the big picture.
3405 2018-08-13 17:04:48 Calling a demon invasion an "immigration" is not different from calling a BP oil spill an industrial accident.

3410 2018-08-13 17:04:29 Wild growth oil!
3411 2018-08-13 17:04:26 The Saudi government realizes that their oil reserves are a finite resource. They want new revenue streams. What better way to do that than to control the technology that will replace their current source of revenue?
3412 2018-08-13 17:04:21 That is because SA knows there is a demand problem.  Now oil traders are finally starting to wake up to that fact as well.

3421 2018-08-13 17:03:07 He is about uncanadian as it gets. He would rather buy oil from other countries rather than our own oil that support Canadian jobs. Hope he loses

3424 2018-08-13 17:02:39 The US don't care about the largest certified oil reserve on the planet? One of the largest gas and gold proven reserves? A country that has been under US corporations rule for an entire century until Chavez? You must be kidding

3454 2018-08-13 16:58:54 Do you remember how we were able to conquer global recession with his policies? Coupled with the fact that there was not much revenue against expenditures as a result of the fall of our major source, oil?

3456 2018-08-13 16:57:35 I seem to remember that is true (I also don't have access to the data at the moment) but that was pre commodities-as-an-asset-class, as you rightly point out. I doubt oil futures would be as good inflation protection now.
3457 2018-08-13 16:57:33 I would’ve said that your FMs statement was pretty strong. Prior of course to Hailey’s arrival. Oil imports have already gone south. More to follow. New spat with  new sanctions..get your  ready. For all of Modi’s  he’s a good little boy really.

3466 2018-08-13 16:55:39 2. Scotland is superabundantly secure and independent in oil production.
Only 7% of the oil produced in Scotland is used in Scotland
545 TWh produced
79 TWh consumed
3467 2018-08-13 16:55:38 He's right. With such high crude oil prices, the challenges in maintaining forex reserves were heavy. But MMS managed the economy much better than Modi. You have to keep the context in mind before you do any comparisons

3489 2018-08-13 16:53:44 I had this happen once and I freaked out. Was an oil painting of my great grandmother that fell off the wall and made a dent on the way down. Was some amazing cotton cord that held it up there for 40 years almost.
3490 2018-08-13 16:53:30 Since I started the oil field I spend way more time with Messiah & I love it!!
3491 2018-08-13 16:53:02 I think it's because I set the oven to its highest setting and put less oil in the pan.
3492 2018-08-13 16:52:58 Works great, but should be mixed with olive or coconut oil to prevent a burning sensation if applied topically - just sayin...
3493 2018-08-13 16:52:56 It's likely the majority of Scots will support NATO membership & expect a "reasonable" level of defence expenditure to protect our EEZ, offshore oil platforms, fisheries protection etc. as well as contribute to UN peacekeeping. Few in my view would support zero military.
3494 2018-08-13 16:52:48 Took 11% profit on our oil short. Pretty easy trade based on the mid-terms coming, plus the technical chart hit its max level. Congrats to members! 13%+ winner Friday, 11% today. Racking up the profits! #ResearchCenter
3495 2018-08-13 16:52:47 Me? I am saying that the % of oil that we use for our GDP will go down but we will still use about as much oil in 20 years as what we use today.
3496 2018-08-13 16:52:46 If you can produce enough lumber for your industries thats is fine. Trade ultimatly should be on things each does not make its own on. Its dumb for us to import oil. We got enough. Blaming Canada for American Dairy woos is wrong period.  It is over production.

3500 2018-08-13 16:52:38 $23 B on foreign Oil What?
#23 billion dollars to buy foreign oil instead of Western Canada Crude. Canada hates Alberta. Maybe Donald Trump likes Alberta. Maybe he wants Alberta. Maybe he could make Alberta great again. Then BC could buy foreign Oil & ship it into Burnaby.
3501 2018-08-13 16:52:35 There's no assets, there's no oil ... basically nothing ! ! ! ..... Anne is a wee unionist troll Gordon, 8.2% of £10Trillion is the answer, plenty, lots, loads, and we'll be taking it ! !

3503 2018-08-13 16:51:58 There. Karlee knows how to check oil, now. 
3504 2018-08-13 16:51:55 If the biggest player in oil is looking to invest in the technology that’s going to kill oil, then that means we are already in disruption mode. These next 5-10 years are going to be an infrastructure boom the likes we haven’t seen since the industrial revolution.
3505 2018-08-13 16:51:45 Yes, in my feet of all places!!

3508 2018-08-13 16:51:32 lift the ban of hydraulic fracturing in Newfoundland,Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Quebec.  Oil and gas don’t cause our environmental problems. We cause the problems. At least oil and gas would give us tax dollars so we can invest in our infrastructure. This is the real problem

3511 2018-08-13 16:51:10 @guanenglim Malaysia should not be too dependent on oil, because water may replace oil as fuel. My buddy Peter is trying to solve the problem of making water fuel that can replace oil. Keep it a extremely highly secret as it may affect many countries.

3519 2018-08-13 16:50:03 You're shadow banned so I'm wasting my time...but  Have you investigated what happened in Venezuela?  How having the worlds largest oil reserves put pressure on the country? How internal AND external pressures led to what is happening now? 

No?  Of course not.
3520 2018-08-13 16:49:54 BC decreased income taxes to offset correct? In Alberta none of that happened. The govt also said a Ctax would replace regulations yet they still placed a cap on the oil sands. It’s nice in theory but poorly executed just like most taxes.
3521 2018-08-13 16:49:50 Sooo the MCT oil doesn’t keep my nearly as full as the coconut oil....but I have more energy
3522 2018-08-13 16:49:43 You took my statement rather personally. You must be making money on palm oil! I was referring to the Amazonian rainforest which is still being plowed. I will look into Indonesia but don’t see how that helps this side of the world.

3527 2018-08-13 16:49:14 One of the major styles of Nigeria's foreign policy is the use of aid as a diplomatic tool or weapon. The case of concessionary oil prices to African states is a case in point.
3528 2018-08-13 16:49:13 thanks @tednaiman! eating more protein and stopping drinking MCT oil made me get rid of my weight stall.
3529 2018-08-13 16:49:13 忘れられ放置されてるだけのような感じではあるんですけどね…！
連絡取り合ってたアカウントごと放置されてしまってる状態は確かにはたから見たら夜逃げみたいですね…ww
3530 2018-08-13 16:49:03 If you could ask any question about CBD oil? What would it be and why? 

#Film #filmmaking #CBD #CBDOIL #Cannabis #Documentary #Amwriting #writers #Question
3531 2018-08-13 16:48:57 Please enlighten the nation but your new   discovery of NALLA GAS. So that our country can finally freedom from importing oil and gas.
3532 2018-08-13 16:48:42 Saudis not big oil, and they own the flop, turns and river.
3533 2018-08-13 16:48:32 well, reality is, you are NO LONGER the nation of Kemal Ataturk. And this is exactly why you risk to go down with Erdogan ... hyperinflation is there, just wait two months ... look at Venezuela : a country rich in oil, bu a corrupt & totalitarian as Tureky ...
3534 2018-08-13 16:48:28 You can afford a lot of oil once you gain the ability to print domestic currency for it
3535 2018-08-13 16:48:25 I had to get an air filter and synthetic oil aint cheap. My car also requires 6qt oil instead of the normal 5
3536 2018-08-13 16:48:21 What is the job title for rubbing oil on models asses?
3537 2018-08-13 16:48:17 Saudi-spat heading to resolution?  Trudeau extends olive branch on Wednesday; Saudis take note, say they will not cut off oil, but demand more to fix it; US reported to be mediating behind the scenes; @cafreeland staying mum; Liberal spinners on Twitter quiescent.
3538 2018-08-13 16:48:08 Lmao...God will give u an oil well soon ...lemme know if u won't decamp
3539 2018-08-13 16:48:08 I wish I had a male friend that would take my car to get a tire and oil change I hate doing shit like that 
3540 2018-08-13 16:47:51 @prophetahuva said that Salva Kiir used to give Kenyatta oil in exchange to have his people come to Kenya. Kenyatta would evict Kenyans from their homes so that the South Sudanese can come to occupy as per the demands of Salva Kiir
3541 2018-08-13 16:47:41 Me: knows spicy food destroys my stomach 
Also me: puts extra hot chili oil on my Thai food

I hate myself. I really do.
3542 2018-08-13 16:47:38 In pretoria wer Cn I buy it and de oil also for hairline?
3543 2018-08-13 16:47:26 I friggen hate running errands alone. More times than anything I'll flop on myself but I can just feel the oil change light pressing me
3544 2018-08-13 16:47:19 Oil industry? #RFID is being used to automatically identify assets out in the field, in lay down yards, on rigs, & wherever there's #oil.
3545 2018-08-13 16:47:11 Coconut oil bubble bath: guarantee ur skin will b soft asf
3546 2018-08-13 16:47:11 Canada is selling arms to the Saudis and buying oil from them.  Whats up with that Canada?  Hippocrates much?  Get off your soap box.
3547 2018-08-13 16:47:03 Oil change, tire rotation, car wash, and brake change all done before 1 
3548 2018-08-13 16:47:03 Please I need this oil for my baby
3549 2018-08-13 16:47:02 That is a load of bull$#!+. 
If you believe that, you've bought his snake oil salesmen pitch. 
Foolishness.
3550 2018-08-13 16:47:01 Yes definitely need his control so these oil Elites don't have a say on how the business is run or what products are sold or how slow they moved to innovate. They have a direct interest to keep oil pumping as long as possible
3551 2018-08-13 16:46:52 Sir MMS achieved 320B$ when oil was 140$ and gold was all time high. This was major reason for CAD which impacts reserves. Now this Modiji selling Wkly billion dollar to keep the rupee intact.
3552 2018-08-13 16:46:52 Ive been using black soap but i mix it with jamaican black castor oil cos it dries the hair but it cleanses very well & use aloe vera for your scalp it helps a lot
3553 2018-08-13 16:46:50 2 things that make me feel accomplished:
1: getting my haircut 
2:getting an oil change
3554 2018-08-13 16:46:48 Not just coal mines but most comes from the oil and gas industry, including natural gas storage--like the Alico gas leak in California
3555 2018-08-13 16:46:46 Don't sell out the the Saudis. It goes against everything you claim to stand for. And it is not in the worlds best interest. They want to control you so they can secure the oil industry for another 100 years.
3556 2018-08-13 16:46:42 I think if you take a look at when Buffet invested in the Cdn rail companies, it was long before the "oil trains" became it issue. It has been awhile since I read his argument for his rail investment but I'm pretty sure it had nothing to do with oil trains.
3557 2018-08-13 16:46:30 頑張れるね、うん頑張るよ、よし、頑張ってこい！
3558 2018-08-13 16:46:27 We are now a retail distributor for EVERCURE CDB oil.  This oil is locally grown and processed.  We have an information brochure available to answer your questions.
3559 2018-08-13 16:46:22 Aku mauuuu!

Dari dulu pengen biore cleansing oil tapi dompetku berteriak tidak sanggup. 
3560 2018-08-13 16:46:22 Considering the stock market has a way to go and oil usually follows, maybe $60? Think this will get really ugly here soon. Tried to be optimistic, but Trump is coming unhinged.
3561 2018-08-13 16:46:09 While I was getting my oil change this kid asked me why I wasn’t in school then proceeded to say I look like I’m 16 & thought dad was paying for the oil change 
3562 2018-08-13 16:46:07 Is it possible to detonate explosions which would concuss and eliminate the oxygen to the fires ...  they do this putting out an oil well fire? Then attack the burning embers with a fleet of water bombers and fire retardants.
3563 2018-08-13 16:46:01 Remember in the rare moments the #NoDAPL protests were reported, they basically parroted the police/oil company press release. They didn’t push back on the narrative or tell us the truth, because their job is to support powerful people crushing regular people.
3564 2018-08-13 16:45:37 The Crew @KBLUAM @RussTClark and @GeoBraunRadio want to thank @EdwardGeretyIII for getting up so early to call from Paradise to update us on the Trade Tiff, Turkey, Oil and other Financial Markets!  Always fun to hear good news!
3565 2018-08-13 16:45:36 アニメキャラの社会性が高まっていくのを見るのは悲しい
3566 2018-08-13 16:45:32 Big Oil is his new best friend now. Got it.
3567 2018-08-13 16:45:32 Wanted to blow on a low.. Happened to a family friend too, His was crude oil, Upstream "oyel' money
3568 2018-08-13 16:45:30 Didn’t the DNC lift the ban on accepting money from Big Oil, due to lack of money? 
3569 2018-08-13 16:45:26 Jangan roomate dgn foreigners arabz dah. Dorg ramai yg pengotor spoiled kids drinks oil money
3570 2018-08-13 16:45:22 "Self-confidence might be devastating, Mr. Holmes. Though I have to admit: in your case it is attractive. And justified."

Typing that message, Irene was enjoying her hot tub of exquisite flower oil. Lavender, rose and patchouli, as far as she remembered.
This time Adler didn't —
3571 2018-08-13 16:45:09 Manuka Honey & Mafura Oil!
3572 2018-08-13 16:45:09 @PTertzakian .... On the matter of West-East pipeline the REAL REASON for its failure is the Oil companies would NOT COMMIT oil to the pipe because its committed to the Keystone and KMI piplines. And by the way the Norther Pipeline sb the pipe as all Nations agree except one.
3573 2018-08-13 16:45:05 Seems a good fit. Oil country. Electric cars. Bombastic azzholes on both sides.
3574 2018-08-13 16:45:02 I don't know, you can try breadcrumbs , olive oil and nutmeg , or soy milk bechamel
3575 2018-08-13 16:44:48 "So every time u refuse a plastic straw/bag & push for corpt &/or govt action 2 limit plastic consumption, then u are not just making a contribution to trash-free seas U are also striking a small blow against oil demand & so helping to mitigate the climate crisis too." #plastics
3576 2018-08-13 16:44:40 I don't think you're a fanatic. That implies you believe in the snake oil you're selling.
3577 2018-08-13 16:44:33 I don’t see how eggs and olive oil can be the villain of anything.
3578 2018-08-13 16:44:27 Am always love to visit kerala whenever I visit Kerala I used to bring T-shirt, shoe and jerkin.but this time am bringing rice Pack,oil,biscuits..etc
3579 2018-08-13 16:44:21 허엉
3580 2018-08-13 16:44:14 Some big news today in the Russian financial sector:
-Russia confirms it's winding down its holdings of $USD
-Russia says it's considering moving away from trading #Oil in $USD
-Deripaska proposes plan to reduce ownership to lift sanctions on Rusal
3581 2018-08-13 16:44:08 "The grooviest and whitest things in the world cannot be cuddled or even ingested - they must be kissed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
3582 2018-08-13 16:44:02 Your hair is amazing. Mine doesn't like coconut oil, it makes it feel dry and hard.. still learning what works and doesn't cos i started last year going natural after a big chop
3583 2018-08-13 16:44:01 Ipe also known as Brazilian Walnut, is one of the hardest types of wood available. Known for its exceptional hardness and resistance to wood boring insects and fungi. Ipe has natural oil so it doesn’t absorb water. It’s a great for outdoor decking. 100 years more life guaranteed!
3584 2018-08-13 16:43:59 Yes...but that was oil...you can't criticize oil...
3585 2018-08-13 16:43:58 Purity by Philosophy. And I made a sugar/honey/olive oil scrub for the days I need to exfoliate
3586 2018-08-13 16:43:29 Anyone tried bulletproof coffee before? I've had it with coconut oil but not with butter and coconut oil.
3587 2018-08-13 16:43:26 I haven't tried CBD oil, not really sure if that would help or not but worth thinking about.  I do hope you will be okay after tapering off Lexapro, experiences vary such a lot with these drugs.
3588 2018-08-13 16:43:22 Either this oil made my tolerance super high or the weed weak, but this gas ain’t gettin me high
3589 2018-08-13 16:43:20 can I give you a hot oil full body massage?
3590 2018-08-13 16:43:15 can i have free oil change and tire rotations? I still have 2 more free oil changes and tire rotations at @HamerHonda
3591 2018-08-13 16:43:13 Gaaandu Pakistani India still buy 16% oil from Iran
3592 2018-08-13 16:43:08 Coconut oil too or anything from hercules
3593 2018-08-13 16:42:59 @wizkidayo is like crude oil in 9ja music industry. When finished everything is gone and behold it is not renewable #wizkidnews
3594 2018-08-13 16:42:51 わーい、楽しみ楽しみ
3595 2018-08-13 16:42:49 welcome to d zoo called nigeria, looting re-looted, Niger delta avengers, na your oil  dem de loot. Soon u will get earthquake
3596 2018-08-13 16:42:43 sooooo my house was the exact opposite and i am team olive oil mayo for life
3597 2018-08-13 16:42:39 Slicker than a can of oil 
3598 2018-08-13 16:42:31 Just like Tupperware and Mary Kay. 
Except the new knock offs are of terrible quality. 

I also use oils for the smell, and sometimes for the placebo effect it may have when tummy issues arise and peppermint oil tricks me into thinking it works. 
To each their own.
3599 2018-08-13 16:42:16 The mechanic is not picking up on my sarcasm in regards to “how awesome it is” that my car filters are dirty and getting an oil change and I think he thinks I’m dumb
3600 2018-08-13 16:42:12 At Honda getting my oil changed.  I truly hate this place.
3601 2018-08-13 16:42:09 วันพรุ่งฝนอย่าตกเถิดดด จะกลับบ้านแล้วขอให้รองเท้าแห้งก่อน ฮร่อมม
3602 2018-08-13 16:42:00 Cbd oil is lyyyyyyyyfffeeeee!!!! 
3603 2018-08-13 16:41:55 Maracuja oil . Because it reminded me I need to stock up on it.
3604 2018-08-13 16:41:54 I guess, America, Canada want to save their oil for a later date after current oil from middle East dries up and then become sole supplier at a high rate. Any thoughts?
3605 2018-08-13 16:41:44 @PTertzakian I think your comment in the Herald "... we’re not self-sufficient..." is simply not true. We ship 3.5M bbls/day to US and I assume consumption only about 2M bbl/day. So we produce enough oil....
3606 2018-08-13 16:41:42 Agreed. Was just about to say this. Germany and the Netherlands do not have vasts amounts of oil, yet are highly taxed with giant welfare states and successful economies.

"Tax kills solution strivers" or whatever you said, is evidently not true in the real world.
3607 2018-08-13 16:41:41 コミケ後は、なんか気力だけやけに元気になって、体力が底尽きた感ある。
3608 2018-08-13 16:41:33 Canfo (grounded) and palm kernel oil.
Mix properly and apply on scalp to the tip, cover hair with shower cap for as long as possible. You can leave overnight if you like. Comb it out and wash with your shampoo and conditioner. Hair texture  soften too
3609 2018-08-13 16:41:32 ฝันดีนะคะพี่สาว @iam_Oil
3610 2018-08-13 16:41:31 The trio on left with pink lipstick in gold case, gold pressed glitter & the oil with GOLD flakes inside, all sitting on top of pink square, possibly a palette? I want that trio on my vanity! Gorgeous!
3611 2018-08-13 16:41:28 Sorry, but you’re generalizing the entire Tesla consumer pool into a radical group of PC maximalists.  Ok. Let’s leave that for a moment.  Saudi Arabia have been trying to diversify its income sources for years now. They’re definitely moving away from an Oil only based economy.
3612 2018-08-13 16:41:11 It is perfectly legal. Just highly immoral to game the system to favour oil trains over more-efficient, safer and less GHG-impacting pipelines.
3613 2018-08-13 16:41:10 Chopped-up corned beef in the noodles, and season the "umami"-flavored ramen restaurants, in the seasoning oil.
3614 2018-08-13 16:41:10 But what also isn't clear from article is how river management issues are connected to the damage that oil and gas companies do to the environment. Seems like there could be some contributory negligence, but that it's O&G companies that are doing the damage and not fixing it.
3615 2018-08-13 16:41:04 どうみても周回ゲーです、本当にあ（ｒｙ
3616 2018-08-13 16:41:03 Please be advised that the original crimping oil formulation Product Code: #FBOCRL and known as #CRIMPX# Metal Forming Lubricant, manufactured by Glenveigh Developments Ltd has been discontinued and is no longer available.
3617 2018-08-13 16:40:52 Been to pick n pay twice and they still don't have castor oil
3618 2018-08-13 16:40:50 今日もまた、ヤマに......
3619 2018-08-13 16:40:50 Took the #dogs on a #walk Got my new #CBD oil yesterday! So far my back #pain is at a 5! It's been years since I've had a level of 5 for the whole day so I'm #excited to see what today will be like! Fingers crossed! #MentalHealthMatters #health #exercise #chronicpain #depression
3620 2018-08-13 16:40:32 I love those almonds. The Gourmet garlic herb and olive oil ones are also really good. Probably also don't pair well with coffee.
3621 2018-08-13 16:40:30 ジルバさんの手品スゲーよなー！
3622 2018-08-13 16:40:26 Learning experience ! Be happy your car isn’t actually leaking oil instead 
3623 2018-08-13 16:40:18 Happy #LeftHandersDay to the girl next to me at @xianfoods who I accidentally sprayed with spicy oil as I tried to slurp noodles into my face without letting my left elbow and chopstick hand hit her. I tried.
3624 2018-08-13 16:40:11 いや…ちょ、やめろっ！耳からはさすがに油飲めないから！
3625 2018-08-13 16:40:07 We are so apathetic to our own legends that we rather pray for them in their ill times than actually try to reach out and give them something to help. Give her some CBD oil, black seed oil, and/or raw cannabis to reverse the pain. #ArethaFranklin #Knowledge
3626 2018-08-13 16:40:06 1. Fishery Business

U need more?
3627 2018-08-13 16:40:02 Actually this was true. For about 5 minutes. After he nationalized oil production all investment dollars and foreign expertise went away, along with Venezuela's oil industry. Funny how that always seems to happen to Socialists....
3628 2018-08-13 16:39:58 Bio oil معجزه میکنه برای همه مشکلات پوستی. تست کنید
3629 2018-08-13 16:39:56 Oil ke
3630 2018-08-13 16:39:56 I didn't even know Tesla was a public company. Bad choice of funding source in my opinion, though. The 9/11 hijackers were Saudis, their women practically have no rights. The world only humors them because of their oil.
3631 2018-08-13 16:39:55 ออยล่ะมีความคิดอยากไปเรียนพุ่นคือกันจ้า แต่ขอกดตุ่มพอสไว้ก่องง
3632 2018-08-13 16:39:50 I just spent $85 on an oil change and air filter, I hate my life so much.
3633 2018-08-13 16:39:40 How dare you and the party take donations from big oil.
3634 2018-08-13 16:39:36 "bush money"? That stuff W borrowed from the Bin Laden family to keep his failing Arbusto Oil Company afloat? Or do you mean hush money? That stuff Trump uses to keep his failing crime syndicate afloat?
3635 2018-08-13 16:39:32 Are you saying we won’t need oil in 20 years?
3636 2018-08-13 16:39:23 Fastest oil change on my life
3637 2018-08-13 16:39:22 I don’t see how the Saudis wouldn’t use their position to influence him, both on non-oil-dependent energy and on SpaceX. Just everyday American oligarchy bullshit. Shouldn’t Miller be trying to deport his arse?
3638 2018-08-13 16:39:20 My hair is craving coconut oil it feels dehydrated
3639 2018-08-13 16:39:16 @AJA_Cortes Do you have any recommendations for joint issues? Got a bad knee and shoulder. I take glucosamine and fish oil already.
3640 2018-08-13 16:39:13 I think you meant snake oil salesman, not snake salesman. Snake salesman would be a retail worker at a pet store. Neither of those two descriptions apply to Pierre. And he is correct in his tweet.
3641 2018-08-13 16:39:07 I just dropped $85 on a goddamn oil change and air filter.
3642 2018-08-13 16:38:45 The new teslarian warcry is that saudis are smart and simply hedging their bets against the juggernaut Tesla.  Apparently crushed by the threat they represent to global oil prices, they decided they couldn’t beat them so they bought them.  Musk has won them over!  Just absurd.
3643 2018-08-13 16:38:39 Hey Donnie, I've just put two baked-potatoes in the oven. Pricked them and rubbed them with salt & oil before popping them in.
Can't wait mate.
Delicious.
3644 2018-08-13 16:38:38 The story specifically mentions the shrinking discount on U.S. oil. But politics and policy can't be ignored either.

3646 2018-08-13 16:38:21 Rick Simpson Oil for the cure
3647 2018-08-13 16:38:09 Last week I baked your focaccia bread and it came out NICE. We were constantly baffled at you pouring more and more oil hahah
3648 2018-08-13 16:38:05 ไปจีนกันจ้าาาา
3649 2018-08-13 16:38:01 Alaskans own 31,191 shares of DIAMONDBACK ENERGY INC, worth $3,234,975. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in UNITED STATES.
3650 2018-08-13 16:37:56 Do you feel no one is listening to you....they are not. You're a LIAR, a confidence trickster, a snake oil saleswoman. and you have single handedly wrecked the Tory Party and the lives of many Tory MP's. You have done more damage to your party than any opposition party could do
3651 2018-08-13 16:37:51 Garlic olive oil is bae

3655 2018-08-13 16:37:37 Pew/sun oil in the thirties
3656 2018-08-13 16:37:30 Other nations are moving aggressively to reduce fossil fuel use.

End subsidies to oil & coal companies. 

End subsidies to animal agriculture. (Not eating meat is an individual action with big impact.)

@ProjectDrawdown shows: sustainability is good for the economy.
3657 2018-08-13 16:37:28 Texas is a hot mess from fracking.  Water table is dropping drastically, trees are dying.  Nothing like destroying a state for oil money
3658 2018-08-13 16:37:22 1/ I can't see how Asia can possibly afford 9m bpd of imports if EROEI continues secular decline 2/ I expect Middle East will swap gas for oil (as Iran has done) with massive growth of CNG in particular #OOTT
3659 2018-08-13 16:37:16 เด็ก 19 นี่มันดีจริงงงงง
3660 2018-08-13 16:37:07 Versatility for me. It doesn’t matter if you’re using them with water or oil based paints, you can’t fault the finish. Keeping with the versatile side of things, I’ve never used a mini roller on everything from doors to ornate spindles before. No brush needed at times.
3661 2018-08-13 16:37:04 Fair for me but I'm sure if it was in their favour they wouldn't be running back to reimburse you, bit like oil prices go up so does fuel, oil prices cone down no reduction. State of the awful, no morals, money before anything world we live in
3662 2018-08-13 16:36:46 @Kelsey_Beckett Omg thank you, savior for those steps on prepping the canvas. I always did the gesso, sand, trace and spray, BUT NEVER thought about adding the thin extra layers of paint before starting with oil paints. 
3663 2018-08-13 16:36:43 Zy just wasted drea last lit bit of coconut oil  this girl is HORRIBLE!
3664 2018-08-13 16:36:38 The shimmer and the oil 
3665 2018-08-13 16:36:26 "Norway is also a social democracy, as one of the most heavily taxed countries in the world (...)" - Norway's economy is primarily resourced base - on oil, just like Venezuela.

So, their economy highly depends on oil prices.

Countries without resources can't adopt this model.

Two of his coworkers walk by, he looks over and says “red light!” They both stop right away. 
My dad looks over at me and says “nothing like a good game of red light green light.”

3689 2018-08-13 16:34:33 I love that this $10,000 worth of work of motion filing continues to be sold to clients.   The counsel is truly selling snake oil and lead pipe dreams to the defendants.

3695 2018-08-13 16:33:54 You’d have to do a hot oil treatment. It’s like steaming your hair but with oil. Go to your salon to get that done. Then get an anti dandruff shampoo and conditioner and wash 1-2 in a week. And you have to oil your scalp everyday.
3696 2018-08-13 16:33:43 The kinkier your hair is, the more porous, which is why it gets drier quicker and needs to be washed less & oiled more - b/c it soaks up moisture & oil. Straight hair is a lot less porous, which is why it gets greasy so fast - grease isn’t getting absorbed at all.

3718 2018-08-13 16:31:42 Yeah maybe the CBC could rediscover Alberta Oil and the NDP and the Liberals.   A pipeline two Eastern Canada would solve any gap in need and help export the extra.  Crazy crazy concept to buy Canadian.  Where is Justin now?

there are two class of oil formation theory:

3806 2018-08-13 16:22:50 The natural oils are on the fringe still. Quite a few products for women like that. Almost none for men besides the Noble Body Face Oil. 
I’m working on a blog article to pay homage to the pioneers of these ideas. Linda Rodin & Shu Uemura both great stories.
3807 2018-08-13 16:22:48 Me too. Dad was a printer and officer local 51 NYC. I was a union apprentice before deciding with a lot of help to go into engineering. Apprentice cleans ink wells, bales paper, and cleans the oil under the presses.
3808 2018-08-13 16:22:47 I need to get back on the fish oil my friends mom tried to get me to take it but I never stuck with it
3809 2018-08-13 16:22:39 K seriously fucking hell. Earlier you assholes wouldn’t let #OIL go below 67 now you just fucking rape her down to 65? JFc. #oott
3810 2018-08-13 16:22:37 Do you remember the BP oil spill?

3813 2018-08-13 16:21:37 Even oil production did not make Nigerian people better off. Do you think leather would?
3814 2018-08-13 16:21:33 Yes it broke the sync when that breaks which looks like it will close below the sync means get out its a wash. Same went with OIL today that 65.72 area target is pennies away.

3817 2018-08-13 16:20:59 Good grief; these Scheer CON men are scared of Muslim women wearing their traditional apparel FFS. Why? What’s MUCH scarier & dangerous are these so-called 'Canadians' with their rigid, dogmatic views who are dumb as dirt, delusional and of course reek of long gun oil. 
#cdnpoli
3818 2018-08-13 16:20:43 I am not sure I understand the logic in buying foreign oil instead of Canadian oil that can be moved with pipelines which is safer and more environmentally friendly.
3819 2018-08-13 16:20:41 To all people that can infuriate the Saudi’s please Tweet something that will make them stop selling us their oil. We can then build the Energy East pipeline and be done with them. We have lots of oil in AB and it is discounted. pls contact Freeland to date them.
3820 2018-08-13 16:20:38 You learn new things about yourself all the time.  For example, I just got my first pair of glasses and I have now learned that I am 80% oil by volume.

3825 2018-08-13 16:19:50 @elonmusk you are without doubt the leader in EV innovation.  One has to ask why you would consider Saudi money as a controlling partner in Tesla, when their primary focus is on anything to sell oil?? They have lots left.
3826 2018-08-13 16:19:44 What you forget here is whether China wants the oil in the first place. Buying was an attempt at a political solution. For China price is not everything and that is a factor most forget. China has much more important goals than just price.
3827 2018-08-13 16:19:44 Tomato paste ingested on a daily basis is a natural sun screen ,  It's not easy incorporating the paste into the diet but with the addition of herbs and olive oil it makes a great dip for vegetables , Something to consider if extra protection is needed during an overseas trip .
3828 2018-08-13 16:19:38 $CL_F has broken lower without another push higher and could now extend to 64.30 - 63.41 initially #Elliottwave #Oil
3829 2018-08-13 16:19:38 Politicians are owned by oil and motor lobbies.
3830 2018-08-13 16:19:37 Not enough. They have to be fawned over and feted; these are violent children
3831 2018-08-13 16:19:37 yes pls! just keen to know what some of your side effects were - i combated my face by using clarins Lotus Face Treatment Oil and Palmers Coconut Oil Facial Scrub, which also helped out my melanin discolouration - but the armsss!
3832 2018-08-13 16:19:36 Flaking is usually the result of dryness, often from over-washing! Try shampooing it less frequently, if you can, or using richer conditioner or an oil if not.

3835 2018-08-13 16:19:17 Women get a car and don’t check no oil, no tire pressure, no nothing they just wake up and drive that hoe 
3836 2018-08-13 16:19:14 I think they gave up too early. Agree though, the debt that shale has accumulated is horrible. With interest rates rising and oil prices falling at a time where they can barely make profit, it's a perfect storm brewing.

3838 2018-08-13 16:19:04 "Stupidly High Taxes in Norway" is a myth.  Yes, they pay a bit more in income tax, the high levels of tax are on companies, particularly Oil.  Income Tax only accounts for about a third of total tax revenues.  THEY ARE AN OIL RICH NATION , just like Scotland could be.,

3844 2018-08-13 16:18:45 For $inda a weakening Rupee (against stronger Dollar) hasn't helped much. $cnx500 just starting to fall.

3851 2018-08-13 16:18:05 Makes a lot of sense. They’re investing in technologies that will succeed after oil and could disrupt them.

3874 2018-08-13 16:15:48 @JustinTrudeau it is time to hold our own future in our own hands. We need to stop the import of offshore oil and develop our own infrastructure to supply Canada.

This sad case is a product of Obama & Hillary Clinton & Lib MSM & Press! And they wonder why we call them the enemies of the people!
3934 2018-08-13 16:09:59 24% dependence on foreign oil (down from 82% in 1990's) We now export more energy than we import. Got NATO pay there fair share. Brought Kim Jung Un to the bargaining table. All in his first 2 years of his presidency. Like I said, leave your little bubble in California and see

3944 2018-08-13 16:08:49 He's all about drilling & mining...fossil fuels all the way.  Feds will chase the cattle out, too, once things are in place for Lucas Oil & that ilk.  His cronies & big donors rule.  Also, reverse any Obama era protections for environment.  One term is more than enough.

3955 2018-08-13 16:07:46 The Americans like to poo poo on Alberta's oil so they can pay us 30.00 per barrel less than they pay other countries. We waited too long to start researching replacements for Oil. If the world stopped using oil  today, we would still see temperatures rise for another 50 years.
3956 2018-08-13 16:07:38 Oil it up, it’s fun. Play with the Joseph sisters and some younger players. Wed, Thurs nights and some weekends. Can’t make all games cause of work but show up when you can!

3982 2018-08-13 16:05:35 Why?  Because you like the idea of keeping even more of the dividends and spoils of your war crimes for yet another oil painting, house or boat, while the middle class and poor are left with less to buy food and shelter?
3983 2018-08-13 16:05:21 Ok love my car but oil changes for her are SO much more expensive
3984 2018-08-13 16:05:19 Goodnight all. Beard inspection went well. All beard deficiencies were restored by the samples of new improved diclopsida beard oil the office squirrels obtained. The exact source of the oil is a mystery. And they were heard giggling in the kilt dryer.

Does Elon think they’ll leave their remaining billions of barrels of oil in the ground? And not corrupt solar innovation? Everyone acts in their own interest.

4061 2018-08-13 15:59:43 Så Tesla-shorts är sponsrade av "big oil" och nu ska Saudi köpa ut Tesla från börsen. Jag trodde att Saudi var "big oil".
4062 2018-08-13 15:59:42 oil.
4063 2018-08-13 15:59:41 i love the smell of sunflower oil, like ugh yes
4064 2018-08-13 15:59:36 what ....oil is over !?
4065 2018-08-13 15:59:32 I have actually been to both places. That's hilarious. I wish we could just stop using any Saudi oil at all, and tell them all to crawl back in the hole they came from.

4068 2018-08-13 15:59:15 I can drive, but I sure cant:
-Keep track of how many miles til I get an oil change (Im 3k overdue...)
-Tell when my tires need air
-Fix a dead car battery

Dont worry though folks! I know that the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell, so Im set for life
4069 2018-08-13 15:59:04 Just jobs in general. I’m here for an interview to help an oil shop branch into wellness services.
Very clever on the retort

4072 2018-08-13 15:58:53 on sep note: Intel says Tories' friends the Saudis promote & FUND extremism in West & linked to 9/11. ...but hey #OIL
4073 2018-08-13 15:58:49 you know that $TSLA is winning when Saudi Arabia is buying it to diversify away from oil. #FundingSecured

4075 2018-08-13 15:58:37 A potentially horrible choice. A country focused on fossil fuel buys into an industry that kills their economic base. They obtain it, shelve it, and continue with pushing oil down our throats. Please, if you’re smart enough to develop this technology, tell me you see this?

4077 2018-08-13 15:58:21 SAKE. The US has oil. Other places have oil. And anyway we should be moving away from oil as a fuel.
4078 2018-08-13 15:58:12 Thank God for Castor oil bruh
4079 2018-08-13 15:58:08 You think you’re special bc you’re anti oil/gas &pro health care?
Oh my. Those are strong D values -in NW at least -since the 70s. I was an environmental activist in college- still am. Ditto w/health care reform.
We probably share most politics/values.
We differ on getting there.
4080 2018-08-13 15:57:51 @iamjohnoliver's Last Week Tonight just posted an excellent show on astroturfing, i.e. fake grassroots advocates. When going through their contrarian names (e.g., "The National Wetlands Coalition", funded by oil companies), all I could think of was "Friends of Science." 
4081 2018-08-13 15:57:45 10 years is basically overnight on the world economy. And there are very few nations that were as dependent on oil extraction as Norway . Their National sovereign pension fund has also diversified out of Fossil fuels due to national economy. Now EV’s are 100% of demand.
4082 2018-08-13 15:57:44 can someone who's good at business explain to me why someone with oil money would want to buy out an electric car company?
4083 2018-08-13 15:57:40 So what was the point of me scheduling an oil change for 12 just for there to be a 3 hour wait...
4084 2018-08-13 15:57:15 can i add to oil yet
4085 2018-08-13 15:57:14 Absolutely agree. A decade ago, I was absorbed in researching the Peak Oil thing. As you can imagine, transition was a hot topic of discussion.

I finally concluded that the transition will be a 'fat-tail' event that will take decades.
4086 2018-08-13 15:57:02 I would like to sit down with folks in Lac Magantique  and ask them to evaluate the safety of pipelines vs Diesel powered trains crisscrossing the country and speeding across our cities. Similarly ask the folks who had to deal with the Exon Valdese oil spill which mode is safest.
4087 2018-08-13 15:56:48 To be fair, oil shouldn't have been up Friday TBH.  It's had it coming
4088 2018-08-13 15:56:47 TO DEMOCRATS! Stop doing Hillary Clinton politics by pushing a largely false Russian narrative! Seek truth & admit the facts! Best way to attack Russia is on climate change and Russia's penchant for oil profits!
4089 2018-08-13 15:56:46 Long story short: about 3-4 weeks ago I was trimming my brows, well Omee hit me and I ended up trimmed my eyelasheswell I tried evening both eyes out n my eyelashes were so small n ugly now i can’t complain cause the coconut oil and Castro oil does works
4090 2018-08-13 15:56:42 น่ารัก จริงๆ 
4091 2018-08-13 15:56:38 I'm not sure I understand the problem.  Canada is self sufficient in oil, and if they weren't there's an awful lot next door.
4092 2018-08-13 15:56:38 Erdogan the dictator of Turkey who is Putin’s puppet working with isis and hamas making lots of money from stealing oil and creating drugs and guns and human trafficking networks with help of Islamic republic, they make billions of dollars of course on the blood of people...
4093 2018-08-13 15:56:32 The world economy will slow -- not good for oil #OOTT

4100 2018-08-13 15:55:36 Using good fats for sauteeing veggies like coconut oil helps keep hunger at bay. & you can eat a lot as a vegan since plants tend to be more filling than processed food products w fewer calories
4101 2018-08-13 15:55:28 There is a lot going on around the world Turkey, Iran, North Korea, oil, dollar, etc... here in South Africa our currency lost massively today and yesterday to the dollar the slide and amounts are probably the most ever recorded... almost unprecedented
4102 2018-08-13 15:55:23 Petrol is made from oil retard guess where that comes from bud you're funding Saudi whatever you drive
4103 2018-08-13 15:55:22 Hahahha, no idea. What I know is that it would have been worse by now if not for the rising price of crude oil and the 14% MPR.

4107 2018-08-13 15:55:02 Sure, but please change village for your clean-air holidays! Livigno is the higher place in EU where you don't pay taxes on oil and gaz, thus each day hundreds of trucks, from long distances, cross high mountain passes at m2000+ just to fill their tanks with tax-free oil!
4108 2018-08-13 15:54:49 I agree, its sad imo but its the way it is.. cream rises to the top but so does oil
4109 2018-08-13 15:54:41 是非ともー！！！
4110 2018-08-13 15:54:39 i call that oil on my face a ‘dewy glow’
4111 2018-08-13 15:54:37 Since all these guys that follow me on Snapchat wanna be friends let’s see if one of them can check they friend oil
4112 2018-08-13 15:54:29 Oil is based on the dollar,that is why USA her economy is strong.The dollar transactions indicates that the US monopoly for global market.
4113 2018-08-13 15:54:15 Why are oil & gas STILL subsidized in 2018?
4114 2018-08-13 15:54:09 Are they possibly trying to diversify? Maybe they see the writing on the wall for the end of the oil age.
4115 2018-08-13 15:54:09 流石にもう朝日が見れるまでは頑張れなくなったな～！眠いが勝っちゃうわ
4116 2018-08-13 15:54:00 No one is making the right question: Do the Saudis know something about OIL that we don't know (deadline) thus making this investment to secure them the power in the middle east? Not by OIL but by Energy, storage and transportation.
4117 2018-08-13 15:53:59 Olive oil is definitely before. Gotta get your body ready!
4118 2018-08-13 15:53:48 An oil temperature problem caused us to have to end our night early hope to have that resolved this week.
4119 2018-08-13 15:53:38 Today, I decided to drench my body in tea tree oil, but honestly, what’s new?
4120 2018-08-13 15:53:36 I think you misunderstand. It’s not tesla giving money to Saudi Arabia. It is Saudi Arabia divesting money from oil etc and investing in tesla that otherwise may have funded more oil drilling. It is fully what we want, assuming the current control of the company remains intact.

We are all of us whole - complete unto ourselves - and for some the arrangement is a smooth and well
Others have to find ways to oil the mechanism, but it still keeps chugging along.
4125 2018-08-13 15:52:44 pretty common really, in the us the oil companies are some of the main leads on alternative energy. they still want to be the ones in charge of getting paid for providing something that they will have the monopoly on.
4126 2018-08-13 15:52:42 We've very hard water and the immersion is a disaster. So is the electric shower. Haven't used either for years. Heat all the water with the oil central heating/boiler.

4133 2018-08-13 15:52:15 Vicks and peppermint oil is a joke. I think it makes it worse, personally.
4134 2018-08-13 15:52:15 In his comment to the protester he seems to admit that he was fighting for ( oil corporations ) energy rather than for the American people .
Perhaps he should tell the same to Trump .

4142 2018-08-13 15:51:11 Remember all those commercials of @DawnDish cleaning birds after the BP oil spill? Well less than 1% of those birds survived making it purely an ad campaign that provided false aid. Maybe they should take the birds off their bottles and twitter header #savagetom

4144 2018-08-13 15:51:10 I was going to ask do you guys have access to mustard oil? It's easily available here in the UK - hence we use more of it.
4145 2018-08-13 15:51:09 I think it's also been suggested the oil isn't hot enough when I put them in.
4146 2018-08-13 15:51:07 that "self interest crap" as you put it, is exactly why the dems LOST 1000 seats under Obama 
MY self interest is not burying any more good people because they can't afford healthcare after being poisoned by oil and gas corporations 
you're welcome
4147 2018-08-13 15:51:01 There are new oil projects currently undergoing "feasibility studies" but have yet to come online. Oil production has been booming since 2011. Shale oil production began to ramp up in 2008. So claims attributing this as a "Trump Success" can't be supported.
4148 2018-08-13 15:50:59 abis keramas masih agak basah pakein aloe vera gel deh, loreal extraordinary oil lg
4149 2018-08-13 15:50:54 We have a pipeline to B.C. that has carried oil to the province safely for 65 years and for most of the distance the new pipeline will twin the existing line on the same path. Unless everyone plans to stop using these products, oil at this time is a necessity, where's the logic?
4150 2018-08-13 15:50:53 Yes ! We have oil ...
4151 2018-08-13 15:50:52 @elonmusk do you seriously think that Saudis, people who live by selling oil, actually wants to fund a company that will ruin them? As in EV vs ICE cars? Just a thought but I'd be careful about this!
4152 2018-08-13 15:50:25 LOOKING FOR THE BEST CBD OIL OUT THERE. @wizkhalifa @SnoopDogg @Sethrogen I have 3 pieces of titanium in my neck and 2 in my back, arthritis and degenerative disc disease. PTSD and wicked anxiety. HELLLLLLPPPP
4153 2018-08-13 15:50:18 this is a no-brainer......Saudis sitting on $3T PIF......do you want to be 99% exposed to oil and fossil fuels and combustible engines of 1918 for the next 100 years??!

4156 2018-08-13 15:49:57 So just to be clear here, you are blaming Trump for the DNC accepting money from oil lobbyists?

4160 2018-08-13 15:49:29 The house of Saud's power will be over once the oil has run out.  They are so disliked by most other Arab countries and nations throughout the world...
4161 2018-08-13 15:49:23 It's weird. Everytime I've gotten a prescription from the Dr its never been for an oil.

4171 2018-08-13 15:48:24 I can totally get why they'd be interested though. Diversifying now before the oil dries up is wise & when it comes to generating solar power, where better than somewhere with guaranteed sunshine?

4208 2018-08-13 15:44:30 Liberals and Government don't buy oil. Those are private corporations which do. Don't like the free market...? As to Canada being inept, it's Conservatives who need to look in the mirror: Canada cannot refine MOST of Alberta's Bitumen b/c we don't have Refinery/Coker capacity

4211 2018-08-13 15:44:11 3 months before oil ministers and others told govt working on long term solution of petrol price but nothing happened,prices up
4212 2018-08-13 15:44:02 The fact that Saudi Arabia is interested in investing heavily in @Tesla should be the news, given that their wealth has traditionally come from oil. But, no, you focus on @elonmusk and make this, once again, an ad hominem attack.
4213 2018-08-13 15:44:01 I have the most ginormous pain-filled zit on my face and no amount of tea tree oil is willing to dissolve it.
4214 2018-08-13 15:43:53 So I learned how to make my own oil for wax pens and lemme tell you, there's LESS than a HALF gram of wax in a GRAM wax cartridge.

4216 2018-08-13 15:43:14 I’ve been telling people this!  Aside from reducing carbon emissions, one very good reason to go renewable electric as possible is to reduce, if not eliminate the US’s dependence on foreign oil.  Not needing foreign energy would put the US in a dominate diplomatic position.
4217 2018-08-13 15:43:13 Also Josef Schachter on Market Call today. I disagree with his crude oil thesis, but it doesn't REALLY differ with the bull thesis that much. His thesis is "oil will dip and then the bull market starts in Q4-Q1". Mine is "oil will flatline and the bull starts in Q4-Q1".

4225 2018-08-13 15:42:37 Thats why I asked if it was strictly a revenue motive because I've heard this strange correlation to the demand for oil in the past. I don't think it makes sense, vehicles made in the last 5 years are significantly more efficient than the 10/20 year old vehicles on the road now
4226 2018-08-13 15:42:18 is this before or after bathing in a pool of olive oil for 20 minutes? Asking for a friend

4243 2018-08-13 15:40:43 I ask @realDonaldTrump the @DNC and the @GOP is their oil worth it. We don’t need them and the fact they used our weapons to commit such a disgusting cowardly strike on children should be what we stand by. All this for things you can’t take with you when you die. PURE GREED!

4260 2018-08-13 15:39:32 We must be honest in our reflection. 
Many Americans are dumber than driftwood and are housebroken in hate and a pledge for salvation ... no matter the snake oil salesman pitching the cure. 
Unfortunately, these cretins procreate and vote.
4261 2018-08-13 15:39:31 After a crazy schedule for the past two weeks, I'm thankful to have a couple of days at home before the next series of events. Laundry, haircut, and oil change for the Durango are the goals. How exciting. :)

4271 2018-08-13 15:38:03 Iran will take advantage and help turkey just like Saudi is giving a $4  billion loan to Pakistan to ease their oil import bill.  Turkey is moving away from NATO into the other camp let see how this all evolves
4272 2018-08-13 15:38:01 that is what i read on that topic - carnies being carnies - but in all honesty the accuuary tables have to be abysmal - worse than coal miners or people who clean up superfund sites or oil slicks -
4273 2018-08-13 15:38:00 I see your point however this has mitigated by use of battery storage. Granted it'll increase the total cost of ownership of the vehicle, spread it to two vehicles and it be charged by solar during the day and it's good bye big oil!
4274 2018-08-13 15:37:35 You know mainstream oil xtraction and distillation didn't start in KSA until the 20th century? Right? This was first found and completed in the 1850s in Ontario canada.

4278 2018-08-13 15:36:58 Oil prices declined yet another week amid the US-China trade     tensions and increasing worries on demand side along with abating supply     side concerns as OPEC and non-OPEC members increase production.

4281 2018-08-13 15:36:40 The technology has existed to do this for awhile (at least in some applications), but the tech has only recently achieving sufficient scale for the end of the oil age to be in sight.

4285 2018-08-13 15:36:25 I worry about the environmentalists being so focused on climate change that they forget the reality of life in this moment. Alberta's oil is bad for the environment, but no worse than anyone else's oil. First we have to invest in research long life batteries, hydrogen cells etc.
4286 2018-08-13 15:36:21 I think he left it out or used coconut oil instead of lard, I can ask him!

4294 2018-08-13 15:35:32 It's been true for a long time that getting off of oil should be one of America's primary foreign policy goals. It would allow us to cut the Saudis loose and give Russia problems also. Those countries are two of the biggest funders of terror around the world.
4295 2018-08-13 15:35:19 Or give him cannabis oil and he was completely against it bc it’s illegal in their state. Kept saying Brandon just told everyone he would fight and beat it and he feels like he disappointed everyone!

4297 2018-08-13 15:34:58 Oil isn't something a country can cut off overnight. Moving in the right direction, albeit slower than I would hope.

4303 2018-08-13 15:34:18 Who told you India can run without oil and gas? 

Any other form of energy won't be more efficient than the one we have been using. Why do you think we have been using oil and gas till now?
4304 2018-08-13 15:34:04 Everybody think they soo slick but what’s a can of oil to water  when they don’t mix
4305 2018-08-13 15:33:59 Are you not guilty by association though for selling items that do contain palm oil ? The ultimate goal for your company surely is to encourage the sales of all non palm oil products ?
4306 2018-08-13 15:33:56 Not at all. They are not naive. Nor was KJI who explicitely told that to Us envoys.
They want oil (and fees) from RU-SK pipeline, tourism in wonsan and few other places.
Less sanctions but still some not to create new elites unrelated to the actual one (taek docet).

4319 2018-08-13 15:32:36 No.

1) Massive economic growth in China, India and much of the rest of the developing world.

2) Until recently there has been no alternative to oil powered cars/trucks etc. Even now alternatives aren’t widely available.

3) lack of alternatives is a technological problem.
4320 2018-08-13 15:32:35 Yup nothing is 100% fungible, there are different delivery costs depending on the buyer, etc. If enough countries boycotted Saudi oil it could have an effect

4334 2018-08-13 15:31:05 Saudi Arabia has a long standing policy of diversification that goes back 40 years at least. To state that an investment in Tesla (however unwise) is an indicator of their lack of faith in the medium term future of oil is non sequitur argument.

If are a country and you have one single source of income, its a good idea to diversify.  Its clear that the Saudis believe that Oil has a limited life span and they want security.
4341 2018-08-13 15:30:30 When I was a kid a truck spilled oil along a quarter-mile stretch of road in my town. We spent days going as fast as we could and sliding every which way. It was crazy fun.

4346 2018-08-13 15:30:19 Maybe if we want to take moral high ground position towards Arab oil money, we should NOT give them money (in return for oil) in the first place?

4348 2018-08-13 15:30:16 Data is the new oil
4349 2018-08-13 15:30:15 Chavez destroyed his country's oil income by nationalizing private corporations & replacing skilled workers with political allies.

Couldn't find a single better example of socialism's inherent corruption & ineptitude.
4350 2018-08-13 15:30:05 Will Britain and the US stop selling weapons to the Saudis? No. Why? Because oil. That's it. I hate my government.
4351 2018-08-13 15:29:56 I might as well schedule my oil change for Thursday since I don’t go into work until 2p
4352 2018-08-13 15:29:56 The level of brain washing on display is frightening; how long were they conditioned for self-hate?
4353 2018-08-13 15:29:54 The real issue is that I know Bristol will be better but after that ‘meh’ race I am tempted to watch the World or Outlaws or the Lucas Oil Late Model Topless 100 which are all running Saturday night instead of Bristol. Might watch those and DVR Bristol for Sunday afternoon
4354 2018-08-13 15:29:52 Also, is this color pencil? Chalk pastels? Oil?
4355 2018-08-13 15:29:25 銀河録 生で聞きたかった...
4356 2018-08-13 15:29:25 So I guess my long time hope for @elonmusk and electric cars to make oil, and Saudi Arabia irrelevant in the future are officially dead. #Tesla
4357 2018-08-13 15:29:15 Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the grain, the wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them. Nehemiah 5 11
4358 2018-08-13 15:29:09 #SubahSavereySamaaKeSaath LIVE: Day 2 - Bano Pakistan Ki Awaaz Season 5.

16 top voices from Pakistan competing each other in bid to win Habib Oil 800 CC Car on 14th August 9:05am on #SamaaTV.
4359 2018-08-13 15:29:07 Coconut oil works miraclessss
4360 2018-08-13 15:29:02 So short sellers who were previously nefarious agents of big oil are now considered smart Saudi investors hedging their bets against the juggernaut tesla who is currently dictating the global price of oil with every musk tweet
4361 2018-08-13 15:29:00 A guy use RSO on a melanoma on his arm over a 6mth period he shrunk it. I can not find a medical study that shows it cures cancer.  RSO is Rick Simpson Oil it’s very hard to get the real shit. Other people have use RSO and says it works.
4362 2018-08-13 15:28:57 Kfb @bintlaxoox
4363 2018-08-13 15:28:55 I wish I knew how to change my own oil.... been here at jiffy lube for 10 minutes still waiting in my car for them to check me in 
4364 2018-08-13 15:28:54 Which is when it's handy there are dump oil fucks with more capital than sense. Saudis are stupid enough to bankroll his shit show for a few years more.
4365 2018-08-13 15:28:49 $8 off oil change today!  Go Atlanta Braves!!
4366 2018-08-13 15:28:46 I’m putting drops of lavender essential oil on my pillow to make me fall asleep faster... haaay. The night owl in me still wins 
4367 2018-08-13 15:28:37 How do you invest in crude oil without 1) getting killed by the carry & roll on the futures or 2) owning physical storage? 

Just because the price of something went up doesn't mean that you could neccesarily have profited from owning it.
4368 2018-08-13 15:28:25 Had oil under my car this morning so my manager has actually just been on the floor underneath it, looking under the bonnet and everything and turns out I just parked in a load of oil:) sorry I’m an idiot thank u :) x
4369 2018-08-13 15:28:24 If Pakistan simply stop the import of all luxiry items for atleast a year and explore new oil fields om urgent basis then our current account deficit could be conveniently turned +ve while creating environmen for more fdi.
4370 2018-08-13 15:28:21 Restructure Nigeria and hand over ownership of oil wells to communities and states. The president should not have the power to allocate oil wells. The revelation by Wole Soyinka that OBJ allocated oil wells inexchange for sexual gratifications shows how dysfunctional Nigeria is.

4372 2018-08-13 15:27:59 1-2) Some news makes me speechless, for example this one: Saudi Arabia as one of the main exporters of oil & gas is interested to buyout the electric car #Tesla (Do you believe me if i tell you a big weapons company has established a PEACE Foundation?). What a strange world & era
4373 2018-08-13 15:27:54 There’s legitimate concern around oil money taking an influential stake in Tesla.
4374 2018-08-13 15:27:52 Are you unhappy with your body wash because it dries your skin out ? Put a few tablespoons of baby oil in it. Shake before each use!
4375 2018-08-13 15:27:43 Hot oil treatments. 
4376 2018-08-13 15:27:43 えへへ、できました
4377 2018-08-13 15:27:42 Just bought some palm oil free peanut butter. Cost twice as much as usual, so will have to use sparingly. Small price to pay to help save #orangutan #wildlife #PalmOil
4378 2018-08-13 15:27:41 Bahahahahahaha! Oh, you're serious? He is working for PUTIN! Do you buy groceries? Do you visit the Doctor? Do you have an automobile? Daughters? Vets in your family? A Harley? Oil heat? I mean COME ON!!! Stop watching FOX ENTERTAINMENT CHANNEL!

4380 2018-08-13 15:27:29 Elon Musk: Saudi Fund Asked About Taking Tesla Private: WHAT IN DA PHUK DOES AN "OIL RICH" CUNTRY WANT WITH PLASTIC BATTERY-POLLUTANT JUNK CARS ?? TAKE DA CAPITALISTIC "KOCH"-SUKKA WITH HIS CARS...WE AIN'T GONNA MISS HIS AZZ OR HIS PLASTIC JUNK !!
4381 2018-08-13 15:27:29 ก็พี่จะไปไม่ใช่เหรอ
4382 2018-08-13 15:27:28 How do you propose that we increase the ability to refine heavy crude oil in Canada? Right now it makes economic sense to export it to refineries in other countries. How does that help "energy independence"?
4383 2018-08-13 15:27:18 oil change  !
4384 2018-08-13 15:27:02 sebnarnnya aku ada iv company oil & gas harini & sebab low confident, aku lipat !
4385 2018-08-13 15:26:58 แม่เพิ่งตื่น..
4386 2018-08-13 15:26:56 Honestly, sometimes ill be doing something and ill start singing "All i needed was some coconut oil!!" knowing damn well, i dont need coconut oil.
4387 2018-08-13 15:26:49 Hypothetically you wouldn’t want to bring a child into this world if you couldn’t feed it. But what if a generation of children didn’t have oil? Or can a culture be so toxic that it is immoral to raise a child in it?
4388 2018-08-13 15:26:40 ทำงานแน่เลย
4389 2018-08-13 15:26:40 @snapwithcallie I would like to see u  spanking ur titties while they are soaked in oil...
4390 2018-08-13 15:26:37 depends upon just how much of that oil reserve is left, the amount of which is a saudi state secret.
4391 2018-08-13 15:26:31 Wat zielig. Ik weet helaas ook niet een oplossing. Wel een vrouw een keer gesproken dat tree tea oil goed werkt bij haar hond voor allerlei dingen maar heb op internet gekeken en dat kan ook nadelen hebben. Misschien tweet plaatsen of iemand iets hier tegen weet.Sterkte met Max
4392 2018-08-13 15:26:26 I just sell two breadfruit and the lady said with saltfish she gone cook it . I should have told her to use coconut oil too.
4393 2018-08-13 15:26:19 This isn’t a good idea to have #SaudiArabian financial backing . They want everyone dependent on oil. Don’t do it @elonmusk it’s a bad idea.
4394 2018-08-13 15:26:13 Oil money? PSG and Chelsea 
4395 2018-08-13 15:26:10 いつも通り夜徹しようとしてるけど明日どちゃクソ忙しそう
4396 2018-08-13 15:26:07 The question here is: Can *you* tell the difference between people who are religious and people who are armed, trained, drugged and brainwashed by Western governments to fight a bogus-jihad for oil under the guise of religion, while the media makes you think religion is to blame?
4397 2018-08-13 15:25:58 ไม่คุยด้วยแล้ว
4398 2018-08-13 15:25:55 To chutiye  tu tv bijlighar me dekhta hai kya. Petrol bharwane oil refinery jata hai. Kaise kaise chutiye pal rakhe hain pappu ne.
4399 2018-08-13 15:25:47 First product I bought @Clicks_SA was their tissue oil range. Must say that ever since, I've never looked for better because their products are as good as those of the big brands. #50YearsOfValue
4400 2018-08-13 15:25:46 Yep, Since their power derived from Oil is waning, why not try to "diversify" so that they can continue to have an undue influence on the technology of the future. just a continuation of the Oligarchic hegemony.
4401 2018-08-13 15:25:46 You ever wonder how Batman suits up so quickly?

A combination of baby powder and olive oil
4402 2018-08-13 15:25:39 I figured they looked like they would cure whatever ails you did you use the oil?
4403 2018-08-13 15:25:37 Oil changed, morning workout in, time to get rid of a few things, shower then head to work. 
4404 2018-08-13 15:25:36 no that's fine I'm not making any sorta of comments on liking egg oil and vinegar all mixed together in a fun blend
4405 2018-08-13 15:25:36 Woke up early and got a work related task, that I had been ignoring, completed.  Got oil changed, mailed package, walked dog. This last one may not seem like an accomplishment to anyone else, but convinced dog to eat food out of a bowl, not off floor. She has a bowl phobia.

4407 2018-08-13 15:25:10 And get my oil changed
4408 2018-08-13 15:25:09 Very disappointed by @elonmusk taking money from head choppers from SA . Oil money to finance ur clean cars? That is big noff for me not to buy a #tesla
4409 2018-08-13 15:25:03 And why is palm oil being used in SO many products without the consumers consent, it’s horrible stuff, I’m happy to pay more for something that doesn’t contain it!!! Lazy manufacturing!
4410 2018-08-13 15:24:59 gonna need you some coconut oil my bro

4412 2018-08-13 15:24:36 @SexyAshtonBlake Beautiful brunette I want to pass oil on your delicious pussy and make you feel the touch of my hand I'll excite you and leave you wet
4413 2018-08-13 15:24:35 So vote for a party that is only marginally better than a climate denier? Polluted urban areas; superfund sites in our Dem controlled states. Supporting endless war which wrecks the environment globally, or taking money from oil and gas companies?
4414 2018-08-13 15:24:34 just absolutely bounced a cod liver oil tablet of this lads head at work and its been the best moment of my life this month so far.
4415 2018-08-13 15:24:16 Look at the debris in the gully. Could contain oil, nails, broken glass.
4416 2018-08-13 15:24:14 South will be an either/or; ATL/burbs will go down hard, but old-school types _who have essentials and skilled crew_ (15-20 ppl) can make it. Some around oil/refining patch in coastal TX/LA might be ok after what's left of Uncle Sam nationalizes the area, puts them to work.

4419 2018-08-13 15:24:09 People think that the US-Turkey dispute is due to the detained American pastor named Andrew Brunson. In fact, it is because Turkey has refused to implement the recent American sanctions against Iran. As most of the Iranian oil & gas is passing through Turkey.
4420 2018-08-13 15:24:06 Henry Ford was calling ethanol fuels the fuel of the future. Rockefeller was successful and hence the beginning of the oil monopoly!
4421 2018-08-13 15:24:04 having a car is nice & all till you gotta pay for gas, for an oil change, for something going wrong etc. 
4422 2018-08-13 15:23:41 Sana oil
4423 2018-08-13 15:23:41 @KenTowerys why do you take appts if you don’t go by them?!? Most of us have to schedule around work!!Fuckin ridiculous!!! Etown Ky store- oil change at 1030 and it’s still sitting in same spot. Never fuckin again! I’ll go to swope for now on
4424 2018-08-13 15:23:27 Life without mayo isn't worth living ....but luckily we will always have olive oil and eggs! (I'm sure many of them have no idea what mayo is made of)  NO potato salad, aioli, chipotle mayo, sauce verte on cold poached salmon? Proud to be old and out of fashion....:)
4425 2018-08-13 15:23:11 hmm klo cleansing oil yg baik itu yg bisa di emulsify sih biar dibersihinnya gampang dan ngga nyimpen residu. tp coba dulu aja, kalau ga cocok ya berhenti

4427 2018-08-13 15:23:01 Did your know that having your tires rotated at every oil change can actually help improve your gas millage?
4428 2018-08-13 15:22:45 I used to really like Diet Mountain Dew (Give me propylene glycol and brominated vegetable oil!), but when they switched from aspartame alone, to aspartame PLUS sucralose and acesulfame potassium, THAT was when I said, "Too many chemicals" haha

4430 2018-08-13 15:22:24 Three runs was more than enough support for Scherzer. Unfortunately, the same can not be said about the Nats pen ;)
4431 2018-08-13 15:22:22 He started Standard Oil and funded Prohibition. Prohibition wasn’t about drinking alcohol, it was about stopping fuel competition. Henry Ford made the first cars to run on gasoline or alcohol! Farmers could fill their cars with their stills!
4432 2018-08-13 15:22:20 I just want my Jamaican Black Castor Oil 
4433 2018-08-13 15:22:17 FBI Deputy Director David L. Bowdich overruled the recommendation and fired him. Bowdich not a McCabe fan boy it appears.
4434 2018-08-13 15:22:12 Every pound generated in Scotland. See the Whisky, Oil, Electricity etc sold by head offices in London. They will be sold by Scotland and the profits collected and taxed here. You really don’t have a clue.
4435 2018-08-13 15:21:54 I must have misunderstood something here....
Tesla has blamed Big Oil companies to conspire against Tesla.
Now, it says it wants to go private with most of the funding coming from the largest oil producer of the world.
You couldn't make these things up even if you wanted...
4436 2018-08-13 15:21:48 ほんっとに無理どうしよう気持ち悪いトリハーダーです

4438 2018-08-13 15:21:38 Ya think ? People who sell oil backing a group that wants to do away with oil based vehicles ? Hmmmm .
4439 2018-08-13 15:21:37 Probably because the most traded commodity on Earth is Oil !?

4445 2018-08-13 15:20:57 I don't think China can hang on much past the November mid-term elections. That's their primary weapon left with the U.S. economy strong - render Trump powerless by a Dem takeover of Congress. Their economy is already hurting, they've removed crude oil tariffs but hang on til Nov
4446 2018-08-13 15:20:54 Endorse Trump?
4447 2018-08-13 15:20:45 @2Yellow9 and @preeti11b 
I am looking to short #OIL around 213 with SL 217 tomorrow.

Your view plz 
4448 2018-08-13 15:20:44 I keep urging people (and lawyers) to use the Sherman Anti-Trust Act against Amazon, Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc., but no one seems to be listening.

It was successfully used against Standard Oil and AT&T (Ma Bell), why not them too?
4449 2018-08-13 15:20:33 What's the saying: keep your friends close and your enemies closer?

Actually, Big Oil is investing heavily in renewables because they KNOW that oil's future is limited. Hence the massive investments in the switch. 

ICE manufacturers are just clueless!

4457 2018-08-13 15:19:47 Separating oil and water.
4458 2018-08-13 15:19:45 We should increase public transport based in electric generated by solar or wind energy. The import of oil can be reduce. Run tram system in all major city and charge toll during peak traffic time.

4470 2018-08-13 15:18:43 Taking @Tesla private. Saudi soverign wealth being potential private investor to fund this? This does not make sense as oil backed fund try to buyout oil-killer. @elonmusk am I missing something here? Is there a hidden plan to kill Tesla after taking it private?

4480 2018-08-13 15:17:36 Second method 
—Take a teaspoon of coconut oil or olive oil 
—Swish the oil around in your mouth for twenty minutes
—This method is referred to as oil pulling and it removes bacteria as well as promotes healthy teeth and gums.

4487 2018-08-13 15:17:17 Think this could be the new normal. Don't see this as a seasonal thing. Doesn't make any sense when you think about the strong demand for heavy grade oil in the  US for refining, especially with Iran, Venezuela and others continuing to show declines, but what do I know.
4488 2018-08-13 15:17:11 I put a ton of condiments on but it’s usually a big mashup. My sandwiches need the paper just so my shirt isn’t covered in oil/vinegar/mayo blend after two bites

4496 2018-08-13 15:16:09 Yeah, I'm with you there. Also worried that they might constrain Musk from truly disrupting the auto industry because the Saudis want to sell oil for as long as possible.

4507 2018-08-13 15:15:02 Thanks for sharing this. Palm trees have already destroyed coast-lines in Asia - those which used to be lined with coconut trees. Unfortunately Coconut oil is not as big & organised a business as Palm oil hence their voice of reason drowns out.
4508 2018-08-13 15:14:52 You look right unfortunately.........
4509 2018-08-13 15:14:51 The topic comes up again: Mayo is good. Too much mayo like any other condiment is bad. Mayo is way better than ketchup and is equal in importance to mustard.

Oil blend and vinegar are still the most important to a good sandwich.
4510 2018-08-13 15:14:46 I’ve been using tea tree oil. No help. I’ll try some of those other things too. Thanks!!
4511 2018-08-13 15:14:45 Drink a glass of warm water every morning & 2 spoons of coconut oil a day

4546 2018-08-13 15:12:06 I do agree with you that we are not in paradise but we are miles away from where we used to be. A place where impunity was committed by the highest authority in the land, a place where sex partners of president where awarded oil rigs, where a president has a quota from contracts
4547 2018-08-13 15:12:03 Big Oil is a yuuuuuge advertiser on these networks.  They can't upset the cash cow, people be damned.  We've got 10 years or less to get the CO2 under control, or you better be building a survival shelter, like the billionaires are.  The Red Hats don't know what exponential means

4560 2018-08-13 15:11:00 Israel was aligned with the US and Saudis long before Trump. Russia’s interests are inherently at odds with that alliance because Russia competes with the Saudis as a supplier of Oil and Natural Gas. Trump and Putin maybe playing footsy but at least Putin knows what’s at stake
4561 2018-08-13 15:10:54 これマジ！？！？！？
4562 2018-08-13 15:10:46 I suggest tea tree leaf oil in moderation as rat bastard bug repellent
4563 2018-08-13 15:10:34 Numbers 11:8 And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil. #Faith
4564 2018-08-13 15:10:33 My number are speculative.  Decisions will go to a vote.  If the Saudi's are truly hedging their Gas & Oil positions, they will likely align with a methodical approach to transition their positions.  Also, the majority of fuel for EV's will be provided by traditional energy means
4565 2018-08-13 15:10:33 SOME people's "work" probably IS easier than staying home with kids.  I doubt many would say staying home with baby is harder than working on high voltage electricity lines or working on an oil rig.

I guess anything that's worth doing should be easy, right?

4576 2018-08-13 15:10:04 1. Ignoring reality does not change it.  Pollution from coal and oil increase health care costs by trillions of dollars over time.  Pollution from coal in China kills in China and then travels to West Coast USA.  People need safe drinking water, safe food, clean air.
4577 2018-08-13 15:10:02 บอกเลยๆ

4582 2018-08-13 15:09:43 And who sells them the aircrafts in exchange for cheap oil? follow the oil and all you find is blood of innocent people and a systematic genocide of middle eastern countries.
4583 2018-08-13 15:09:29 They blame corruption, opaque oil policies and so on for piracy? So typical, pointing at the mouse and forgetting the elephant. Poverty, mounting social frustration, pollution, lack of alternatives, desperation... how about these?

4592 2018-08-13 15:08:56 The Saudis have been funding terrorism for decades focused on destroying western society. Wahhabism is a menace that is overlooked & underestimated when we buy Saudi oil that, in turn, strengthens this repressive theocracy. Human rights & fundamental justice? Hardly.

4595 2018-08-13 15:08:38 Stop praising people who worked for Clinton and Obama. They were fine sending in underarmed  troops into Mogadishu, sitting on hands during Rwandan Genocide,  excusing the deaths of Iraqis children due to oil embargo, drawing redlines and doing nothing, allowing Putin’s power
4596 2018-08-13 15:08:36 This is because Canada is still a free nation not tied to Saudi oil and money. It’s the UK, France, Germany and especially the USA whom have put aside their moral compasses for a few years.

4603 2018-08-13 15:08:12 Last I heard, Alaska Permanent Fund is still paying "dividend" to ea resident. As @BarryRabe points out, the severance tax (on dollar value of oil  & gas produced) that funds the APF could easily be tweaked into a #carbontax.

4609 2018-08-13 15:07:35 It also depends on the work.  I doubt many would say staying home with baby is harder than working on high voltage electricity lines or working on an oil rig.
4610 2018-08-13 15:07:35 Alternatively, you could cover it in garlic paste/olive oil and wrap it in prosciutto (preferably) or bacon (more likely).

4632 2018-08-13 15:05:32 Very interesting video, I have been using c60 in olive oil on my face and it is much softer as is the case for all my skin. I haven't been applying it regularly though. I will start now! Thanks again 
4633 2018-08-13 15:05:19 USA has destroyed the Middle-East with military power and massive weapon and oil deals. But now they are trying to destroy Turkey by attacking it's currency. USA will not succeed.
4634 2018-08-13 15:05:18 I had a dream that I flew to Philly bc @AMBERWlLSONN opened up an essential oil company and business was BOOMING
4635 2018-08-13 15:05:13 *creeeeeeeeeeak* I need me some oil
4636 2018-08-13 15:05:11 Ketchup > Olive Oil, any day of the week
4637 2018-08-13 15:05:05  most of the time I’d totally agree but I found this amazinggg salad with blue cheese, apples, walnuts, and olive oil dressing that has since changed my mind lol.
4638 2018-08-13 15:05:03 So I’ve added a new ingredient to my morning detox...... Black Seed Oil.

4643 2018-08-13 15:04:12 She broke her spine, both feet, and her arm. She had 7 surgeries and was bedridden for about 6 months. The cbd oil help physically and mentally. People have been taught that supporting legalization makes you a criminal or dirty hippie.

4646 2018-08-13 15:03:48 I’m a trained chef and one of the first things we learned to make was mayonnaise, and with good oil and mustard and vinegar it could taste incredible - Hellmans is Juat that it’s what and has no flavour so it’s not mayonnaise we are tired of it’s hellman’s blandness.
4647 2018-08-13 15:03:43 Asking for eggs cooked in olive oil and if their bacon has sugar at the @WaffleHouse, I’m pretty sure the fine folks of #Texas would be just fine if @kapman didn’t move down there as well. Win-win for all. Oh, and Texas is not “the south”. Yeesh. 
4648 2018-08-13 15:03:43 There isn't dealership out there that deserves 10/10!!!!! The last place I bought a car was good until I found out they didn't talk to the service dept and they wont give me free oil changes nor will they even change the oil. Glad I didn't fill it out!
4649 2018-08-13 15:03:34 Quite possibly ground up animal bones and hides, some kind of red coloring,  and oil.  Or maybe it’s Jello and whipped topping

4657 2018-08-13 15:02:49 Hi Michael, We use palm oil in some of our products because it has a fat composition with functional properties needed in these products. We are very aware of the problematic situation with palm oil production and therefore use certified, traceable palm oil. >>
4658 2018-08-13 15:02:39 Worked a 12 hr shift yesterday. Then went to my 2nd job all night and here I am, at Walmart. Getting a oil change at 11am with a fussy teething baby with no sleep

4662 2018-08-13 15:02:15 @trish_regan Venezuela, one of the richest country in the world because of oil production, has been destroyed because of USA. As Cuba and in the 70es Chile. Your government is behind all of this. Your fake news are good for your audience of ignorant rednecks not the world.
4663 2018-08-13 15:02:03 I nearly died. I was baptized with with Palm oil private school for that matter....teaching is not just it for me

4665 2018-08-13 15:01:51 Yes, dear, and the earth is flat and the Antarctic treaty means that no one but government spys can go to antarctica..

4673 2018-08-13 15:01:22 the chemical compound that causes popcorn lungs (diacetyl) is not in monq, they have no artificial flavoring. It is all essential oil based mixed with vegetable glycerin. My mom thought the same so i had to do research!

4678 2018-08-13 15:00:57 It's very straightforward to be fair, if I'd fully realised how easy I'd have done 2 services already. Once you've got over the nerves of undoing the bolts and knowing you've got the right oil and measures it's a piece of piss. Gona put some oil in the air chamber next
4679 2018-08-13 15:00:54 The fiscal deficit target may continue to remain stretched due to rising oil prices. If it continues to rise, we have an option to raise US$ deposits to ensure external stability. Will the government be able to cap the deficits safely ahead of 2020 elections ?

4688 2018-08-13 15:00:07 Instead of investing in a national oil industry, let's keep on taxing what little population we do cause, and continue buying oil off a royal family that regularly abuses women and minorities.

4689 2018-08-13 15:00:01 DAwg how you get this oil off ?
4690 2018-08-13 14:59:56 I'm thrilled to be a part of this development with @KTCEdibles - Mustard oil has been banned as a food product for years in the EU yet it's such an important part of Indian cuisine!
4691 2018-08-13 14:59:53 Why put it in so may products?  We got along just fine without it!
Ban all palm oil imports!

4693 2018-08-13 14:59:48 I think the oil industry had studies even in the fifties about global warming.
4694 2018-08-13 14:59:37 Because oil is the main power source of the world. Governing it means take control of everything. You are just delusional based on propaganda.
4695 2018-08-13 14:59:26 It is established that America has no interest in oil from Israel.

So, still no answer to the question. List one American interest in the Middle East that is not really an Israeli interest.

4713 2018-08-13 14:57:16 Already did. There's something delightfully pleasant about being able to fit voting into my daily chores as easily as I might go out for an oil change. "Go to the grocery store, pick up some cat food, mail off the bills, vote, return the library books…"
4714 2018-08-13 14:57:14 Banget. Vimala aja dia masih pake 20% palm oil katanya, bisa no palm oil tapi by request 
4715 2018-08-13 14:56:49 This is the crux of the matter, isn't it.  The IEA should be called the IOA because their focus is oil.  Previous IEA projections completely missed the growth in renewables.

Then oil companies, governments, and others use IEA forecasts to justify oil production expansion.
4716 2018-08-13 14:56:43 Ima get my oil changed go play call of duty for a little. Take a nap. Then go pick my baby mother up from the air port.

So what are you doing for work now?  I know you were working with oil rigs in OK, but what now?
Have a great day!
4720 2018-08-13 14:56:27 Pretty sure it is impossible. I mean maybe NA countries can secure oil only from countries that are not Arab / Islamist nationalists but that will only mean other Western nations will be pushed into such dependency. Which from Geo-political POV makes the move pointless.

4730 2018-08-13 14:55:41 True, the US doesn't get much of its oil from the Saudis but it is a fungible resource. Over production in one region drives down prices for everyone. As one of the biggest global producers, SA has an outsized influence on the price
4731 2018-08-13 14:55:34 Their final destination will b the slaughter pipeline . It certainly would be more economical to leave them in the wild ,maybe haul water if need be.

I'm glad I didnct take Benzos, even tho my Dr kept perscribing them to me. I'm 2wks off a quick SSRI (Lexapro) taper after 9yrs use bc my body started reacting bad to the meds.. I'm praying my body heals soon.

4756 2018-08-13 14:52:34 Prospect of continued strength for USD over coming months constitutes an even greater concern to bullish oil traders than an escalating trade war between China & the U.S.,the world's 2 largest economies.
4757 2018-08-13 14:52:25 A transfer of money from industries that are destroying civilization (oil & gas)

to industries that protect the environment and constructively grow the economy (renewables).
4758 2018-08-13 14:52:14 DYK? One of the world's largest ever built ships- Seawise Giant- a ULCC (ultra large crude carrier), was 15 meters longer than the Empire State Building is tall- 1,503 feet- over a quarter mile long and could carry 10% of US daily oil consumption.
4759 2018-08-13 14:52:09 3) Also stay away from relegions the have "new Revelations from God". These are deceptions done by Satan to get people to follow men rather than know God. Example: LDS Church. Their name even says they are a later version. An original oil painting is more valuable then any copy.
4760 2018-08-13 14:52:04 Shouldn't be surprising, IMO.  After all somebody had prophesied "Data is the new oil".

BTW, chances are that they won't bother once everything is linked to Aadhaar.  Instead of calling, they'll renew the insurance & debit your account.

4767 2018-08-13 14:51:20 I know I'm nitpicking, but there is a point. Jewish / Israel power exists too because it is subcontracted from those oil and arms interests. Power is made more powerful because it can veil itself, clothing itself in the armour of anti-semitism

4781 2018-08-13 14:50:15 That's really amusing, but it reveals out a truth: KSA can't rely on any single investment to hedge future (now increasingly anticipated) decline in its oil exposure. Rather, it will need a broad portfolio to accomplish that, and even then, the proportions are just too large.

4786 2018-08-13 14:49:46 Crude futures trade inversely to the USD. A stronger U.S. dollar makes oil more expensive to much of the world,so oil prices tend to fall as the American dollar rises.

4796 2018-08-13 14:49:09 According to the EIA, we get 9% of our oil from the Saudis. 40% from Canada and 7% each from Mexico and Venezuela. So, I'd say that the Saudis wouldn't be able to change much to support their investment.
4797 2018-08-13 14:49:03 Someone just asked another person how to spell oil change... like even if you honestly didn’t know (which is wow) I wouldn’t ask? Look it up? Save yourself the embarrassment lol
4798 2018-08-13 14:48:59 Oh of course. I dont believe in the pee tape, but he does have ties to Russian oligarchs.

I just never thought that the Iran Deal hurt Russia before now, but it does. Russia's economy depends on Iran's restricted oil distribution.

4801 2018-08-13 14:48:53 Because Quebec has been rejecting pipelines from the west since the 50’s.  Initially it was because gas produced from ME oil was a nickel cheaper.   During the 70’s when oil from the ME spiked, Justin’s daddy devised the NEP. Where Alberta oil would subsidize imports.
4802 2018-08-13 14:48:51 How does murdering children become 'legitimate"? This is sick & we have 2 find a way 2 stop it. Some day, I hope, a country's moral compass won't be dependent on the amount of oil they have. If no one needed oil 2 survive, this kind of bullying without sanctions won't happen.

4864 2018-08-13 14:43:11 It's not all about party. One thing u must not fail to understand is that Lagos State was sometime FCT and the richest asides from oil.

4868 2018-08-13 14:43:05 3/ ...oil provided the liquidity to the USD for it to allow as reserve settlement asset.  Economically, oil can provide sufficient liquidity to whatever instrument it sees fit to settle it.  The question is always one of politics.  Hence the US State Dept oil mkt we have today.

4905 2018-08-13 14:38:43 1/ To the contrary, China appears to be using the law of 1 price to its advantage, while the US is attempting sanctions of key facilitators (China, Russia, Iran, Turkey) to stop the law of 1 price.  They wouldnt be paying 1/8 price of oil...
4906 2018-08-13 14:38:37 Yh and we should continue that by pushing for policies such as a higher tax rate for big oil and gas companies
4907 2018-08-13 14:38:30 Stop. Think. Why would Saudi PIF ever pay $420 for an object trading at $360? Even as a hedge against a long oil position, zero reason to take a captive position in $TSLA when every auto maker in the world will have an EV offering in the next few years. There never was a deal.

4909 2018-08-13 14:38:25 The world is interested in southern  Cameroon's oil and gas ,no matter how many people are  killed on daily bases,women and children etc,How can people continue to suffer for years  because GOD bless their land with oil and gas ,GOD himself will see us through.
4910 2018-08-13 14:37:55 The cat that was buying oil from #ISIS infusing them with cash calling an innocuous #American preacher a terrorist? Thats rich! Fuck #Turkey, why the hell should thay even be in #NATO? @FoxNews

4913 2018-08-13 14:37:47 It can be "grown" in labs, using mineral oil as a base, wich is far more pollutant and less safe. Obesity has nothing to do with palm oil use, it relates to carbs (like sugar, corn syrup and flour). Not all palm oil is produced the same. Sustainable palm oil is the best option.
4914 2018-08-13 14:37:39 #India must look now for alternate sources of oil & not close its options with #Iran. If Iran closes the Straits of Hormuz or Bab El Mandap, the developed world will be in trouble and regime changes will take place in the #ME. Our dependence on oil is absolute
4915 2018-08-13 14:37:35 We should also be skeptical of dual registrants, because they can more "legitimately" fake being financial advisors even though they are nothing more than product pushers aka product peddlers aka snake oil salespeople.
4916 2018-08-13 14:37:33 @RickRoss bossin up wit the beard oil
4917 2018-08-13 14:37:33 -Saudis buy $TSLA
-Saudis shut down $TSLA
-Saudis claim "See, it's impossible to build profitable EVs. Looks like you'll still need our oil"
4918 2018-08-13 14:37:33 $TSLA is the perfect hedge for Saudi Arabia, 80% of revenue from oil.
4919 2018-08-13 14:37:27  Yep, I'm familiar. The MCT oil I use is from Bulletproof.
4920 2018-08-13 14:37:11 i think there are multiple levels here – primarily a lack of transparency from manufacturers about their use of palm oil & products, and a very slow move from 'roadmaps' to actual/any sustainable use of palm oil. i will use products that have sustainable sources of palm oil.
4921 2018-08-13 14:36:59 Dude.. please do shopping for daily commodities today and then tell me inflation is lowest.. crude oil durimg UPA was 112 dollar per barrel and still petrol was 70.. here during NDA it went as low as 48 dollars.. let Iran sanctions take effect.. we will cry..
4922 2018-08-13 14:36:38 When I see baby oil on the TL I don’t even need to check who it is,I know it’s Des who RT’d it.
4923 2018-08-13 14:36:33 "Tesla's mission is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy."

Saudi's mission is to sell enough oil to stock their palaces with "Miss World" contestants.

Those two missions are clearly incompatible, lol.
4924 2018-08-13 14:36:30 Everyone who knows that oil resources are limited....
4925 2018-08-13 14:36:02 *bristling as she applies much too much oil to her chest and arms, wasting it* *it was only two week. She could survive two weeks*
4926 2018-08-13 14:35:57 So Russia's economy depends on Iran's restricted oil distribution? That makes sense.
4927 2018-08-13 14:35:34 Use olive oil for 30 minutes it always works 
4928 2018-08-13 14:35:34 La prensa mercenaria, responde a los intereses sus patrocinantes. Sin novedad.
4929 2018-08-13 14:35:31 Do not break rules that protect life. Do understand Energy and find a way to create energy. Oil is needed. Keep it clean don't waste.
4930 2018-08-13 14:35:23 I’m celebrating today by marinating a Joint in hash oil
4931 2018-08-13 14:35:19 i was looking at these korean skincare samples and im so glad i did before putting them on my face bc one of them has fuckin horse oil in it what does that even mean stg gross ass
4932 2018-08-13 14:34:42 Nein, haben wir nicht. Zu warten, bis das Peak Oil erreicht ist, wovon manche schon ausgehen, dass es so gut wie erreicht ist, macht es nur sehr teuer.
4933 2018-08-13 14:34:32 i love coconut oil! now my hair doesn't feel damaged after taking a shower & it being air dried.

4935 2018-08-13 14:34:18 I've had it before (comany called Bulletproof coffee) and I loved it. But it was also done "right"....  No oil slicks allowed....
4936 2018-08-13 14:34:18 Sudhanshu ji is absolutely right. We had kept the prices of petroleum products artificially Lowe during 2006 to 2008. These were the times when prices of crude oil were soaring in the international market.
4937 2018-08-13 14:34:15 Wat kulit berminyak cenderung berjerawat kak lu. Huhuhu aku emg bekas jerawatan juga terus minyakannya parah. Pake oil control aja baru bersih kertas ke 4
4938 2018-08-13 14:33:58 The Saudi's are hedging their fund against their large Gas & Oil stake.  Makes perfect sense, if you're a smart investor that wants gains and protection on your money.
4939 2018-08-13 14:33:57 Ok so wen ok ok ok my lets just say friend comes over 2 m howse oil lets just say il show her 2 u (hehehe)
4940 2018-08-13 14:33:55 Well my dumb ass washed all my clothing with a sweater that has diff oil on it. And now my whole entire wardrobe smells like it
4941 2018-08-13 14:33:49 All I see from comments below that Americans really hate Russia ,no matter what , and this nation trying to say that they democratic and piece lovers..... Tipical American BS slave and aboriginal killers meddling in every country affairs ,invaders  in any country with oil and etc
4942 2018-08-13 14:33:48 Agreed. Look at the cognitive dissonance on display when a fan base that is overwhelmingly pro gay and feminist, and anti oil, cheers on a deal with arguably the most important oil producer on the planet, that throws gays off buildings no less, because Dear Leader says so.

4948 2018-08-13 14:33:03 There are ways around the sanctions. The bigger issue is to prop up oil markets. When the price or demand drops below certain levels it will cause a number of economies and governments to collapse. A reduction of capacity props up the market by constricting supply.
4949 2018-08-13 14:33:02 I think I wanna take a nap. Pick up sister for lunch. Get an oil change. Then spend the rest of the day getting ready for Bey Day.

4954 2018-08-13 14:32:15 The jeanie is almost out of the bottle, sadly.
At least we were spared the greasy food dripping in olive oil and the stench of garlic on their Iberian breaths. Wonder if she's related to Bawjaw?
4955 2018-08-13 14:32:12 The base is resourced mainly by non locals. 

We wouldn't have to worry about the contaminating leaks into the water table from an aging fleet. Incident impact has been masked as classed non-reportable to SEPA.

There are also oil reserves which cannot be accessed because of base

4957 2018-08-13 14:32:09 blended well, it just makes the coffee more creamy, and dare I say, luxurious. Not blended enough, and yeah, the result is not too appealing oil slicks. 
4958 2018-08-13 14:31:57 Time to get this oil change on the truck 
4959 2018-08-13 14:31:41 The irony of Tesla on a oil run vehicle is sad too.
4960 2018-08-13 14:31:30 Coconut oil and Aloe Vera are gifts we do not deserve mannnn

4962 2018-08-13 14:31:18 The attack on Yemen children by Saudi Arabia and its allies (the USA) is a perfect example of our government being on the wrong side of justice just to further oil interest
4963 2018-08-13 14:31:15 Pidge is getting an oil change and a bath today. So don't want to go to the kia dealership
4964 2018-08-13 14:31:10 lol. 

your snake oil is losing its charm.
4965 2018-08-13 14:31:10 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, but without fear about these important and sensitive issues.
4966 2018-08-13 14:31:10 Higher tariffs means countries will go elsewhere to do business. Oh and coincidentally Russia has lots of steel, aluminum and oil to sell. Business must be booming for them.
4967 2018-08-13 14:31:02 Elon just created an opening for SA to destroy him and probably $TSLA too. All SA has to do is issue public stmt saying "We have no interest in funding $TSLA buyout, and we've sold all of our shares in the company." Protects oil by damaging big EV player. They should do it.
4968 2018-08-13 14:30:39 Boooo don't sell to the oil mafia! What are you thinking??
4969 2018-08-13 14:30:34 Hello, i would just like to let all of you know that I’m getting my oil changed for the first time ever. Bailey is annoying me and I’m going to burn her face with a waffle iron. Please don’t ask if she’s okay because she is not. That’s the tea. Sincerely Olivia Perry

4971 2018-08-13 14:30:32 Not itself, but it is just cheaper to integrate with the US regional distribution. There are pipelines that are already at capacity but oil supply in Novia Scotia, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland are too far and small to build pipes to.

4976 2018-08-13 14:30:07 You really are a stupid twat. Norway has all these public services as Norway literally floats on a sea of oil & gas. Their economy is a petro economy. But Norwegians are not stupid & that’s why they’ve stamped down on refugees so as not to bankrupt their public services.
4977 2018-08-13 14:30:04 Tea tree oil!!
4978 2018-08-13 14:30:04 Brent Crude was at $150 petrol costed around R5 so what you saying is really ignorance. The lasted fuel hikes doesn’t revolve around $/R Exchange and also OPEC have not cut their production the hikes are not necessarily done by oil markets or $/R exchanged you really are dumb :)

4981 2018-08-13 14:29:56 Absolutely! You are 100% correct. The primary reason for the Putin Trump alliance is the desire to build Putin’s Russia back into prominence and rebuild our shared “culture” throughout the world. This has been stated clearly by Bannon. Oil, and our dependency on it, is crucial.
4982 2018-08-13 14:29:49 สู้ๆๆนะจ๊ะหนุ่มน้อย
4983 2018-08-13 14:29:44 No not her money, but our commonwealth, she s their to propose laws and check the executives and also oil governance but at the same she is there to agitate and pressure the executives to their responsibilities. This she has being doing excellently!
4984 2018-08-13 14:29:40 Boo no sale to the oil mafia.
4985 2018-08-13 14:29:35 The main way Iran intends to respond to an invasion backed by the US, is to attack Saudi Arabia — Iran’s leaders know that the US is more dependent upon the Sauds than upon Israel — so, Iran’s top targets would be Saudi capital Riyadh, and also the Ghawar oil field, ZUESSE
4986 2018-08-13 14:29:34 I need to get up and go get my oil changed
4987 2018-08-13 14:29:31 "Big Oil / Persistent human rights violator" Saudi Arabia buying out "Green tech & Futurism" Tesla is probably one of the most ironic things I've heard in quite a while

4989 2018-08-13 14:29:17 Wow that was a lot of fantasy garbage you just wrote.
By the way if you want to get technical, Shetland has 70% of the uks oil and gas in its waters, Shetland was never a legitimate part of Scotland.
It's Shetlands oil, not Edinburghs and shetlanders feel no love for your cause.
4990 2018-08-13 14:29:12 Essential oils are Fragrant Oils extracted from plants chiefly through steam distillation (eucalyptus oil) or expression (grapefruit oil)
4991 2018-08-13 14:28:57 So you want restrictive immigration? no min. wage? Lack of diversity in population? A Monarchy? Sweden is actually trimming back it's welfare state, becoming more privatized. Norway has a mixed economy and relies heavily on Oil exports. Also, all 3 combined pop. Is less than TX

4993 2018-08-13 14:28:52 A fund from the oil kingdom?  Is this the sequel to “Who killed the Electric Car?”

5004 2018-08-13 14:27:53 Companies in Canada like Irving importing Saudi Arabian oil could be viewed as a company that hates Canada, women's rights, equality, and supports Saudi Arabian state sponsored 9/11 attacks on the USA.

#cdnpoli
5005 2018-08-13 14:27:21 Why would an oil producing country back an electric vehicle? Oh, they are forward thinking! Unlike our own President and energy companies.
5006 2018-08-13 14:27:20 Pretty much full circle, if $TSLA's survival is dependent on the biggest of big oil.

5007 2018-08-13 14:27:17 China is a world leader in all alternative energies & research. Canada is shamefully behind and we risk losing out on this golden opportunity b/c of Neanderthal thinking like you demonstrate. Oil is killing us, we need to set an example. Long term rewards > short term gains!
5008 2018-08-13 14:27:14 We got away from using whale oil pretty quickly as an energy source back in the 19th century. New technologies replace old ones. Evolve or die off.
5009 2018-08-13 14:27:13 @elonmusk please don't sell Tesla! They will kill it! It hurts their oil so they will kill it... Don't help them!
5010 2018-08-13 14:26:40 Totally agree
We don't need their oil. Let's forget the carbon tax and build a pipeline to the east coast.
5011 2018-08-13 14:26:35 They were an afterthought - but I like them. They’re poached in white wine and orange juice and sesame oil and lime. The broth is lemongrass and shiitake mushroom. Going to try to plate it better tomorrow.
5012 2018-08-13 14:26:34 Fresh mayonnaise, yes. Hellman's is mostly soybean oil, though, not real food.
5013 2018-08-13 14:26:29 It’s also no secret among Persian Gulf traders that in the  event of a US-Saudi-Israeli war  against Iran, a real scenario war- by the Pentagon would be “the destruction of oil wells in the [Gulf  Council]. as destroying the oil wells would be far more effective.”than Hormuz Zues

5019 2018-08-13 14:25:42 Axing the Iran deal actually gives more power to Russia because of oil. We didn’t sanction Iranian oil if they were compliant. Now Russia gets more oil revenues.
5020 2018-08-13 14:25:41 Anyone whom doesn’t say replicator is wrong.   Want to reduce our impact on the earth by 99%.  Want to end world hunger.  Want to end dependence on underground oil.   Want all public domain drugs for the same low price.  Want to remove 50% of traffic. Replicator.

5029 2018-08-13 14:25:01 Several countries already have dates where their cars go full electric. A few more, and the world will reach critical mass, and the rest will follow. The Saudis, and most of the oil producers, have known they've to diversify for a while now.

5034 2018-08-13 14:24:20 I'm old enough to remember a time when @FredericLambert defended doxxing someone solely on the basis of a minor oil industry investment unrelated to $TSLA.

Fred, I imagine you have sold 100% of your shares now in disgust, have you not?
5035 2018-08-13 14:24:17 I sure hope you don't drive a car or heat your home with oil or gas or you're part of the problem.
5036 2018-08-13 14:24:15 @elonmusk This explanation makes no sense.  Why would the Saudis need to have you take $TSLA private in order to diversify from oil?  And what is the economic benefit of paying up, using equity, to swap liquid public shares for non-liquid private shares?

5038 2018-08-13 14:24:06 Elon Musk: Hey I'm building electric cars so we can be free from the tyranny of foreign oil!

Us: Great!

Elon: Oh and I'm gonna put the company up as collateral to Saudi Arabia.

Us: Oh.

5044 2018-08-13 14:23:35 Luke, everything you are suggesting is a strong violation of "1 price"... if China is paying 1/8th the price of oil, they will not receive oil UNLESS the seller is an extraordinarily distressed seller.  You are misreading the Turkey story... they sold the oil for USD.

As I'm typing this, people are standing in line FOR TOILET PAPER. People can't even wipe their asses. Socialism did this.
5055 2018-08-13 14:22:05 I no oil has a lot to do with it. But must be more to it. Islam is taken over every thing we no.

5065 2018-08-13 14:20:26 And nothing from McKenna on this subject, you headline minor spills of any oil while ignoring this environmental disaster
5066 2018-08-13 14:20:22 Most fuel burning equipment is replaceable by electrics and where fuels are still require (b/c there is no practical electric alternatives - ie. jet engines), biofuels replace oil. Why is biofuels better? B/c it is carbon neutral. BTW, biofuel sources can be much more than corn.

5070 2018-08-13 14:20:02 No oil is going down
5071 2018-08-13 14:19:58 It’s really odd to see two large mysterious blast in the same week in the area the Regime wants to take next.  Even more interesting is it was weapons and oil.  Just strange.
5072 2018-08-13 14:19:46 I had chronic migraines for the last several years. It got to where I was having them many times a week. Magnesium oral supplements did nothing. I started using magnesium oil transdermally and my migraines are gone! Who knew!?! Thank you for bringing pediatric headache awareness!
5073 2018-08-13 14:19:41 I can tell you for free that cleaners in oil companies earn far lower than the police constables. They also do their jobs diligently with pride, they do not cut corners or sabotage company's waste management policies. They are held to very high standards also.
5074 2018-08-13 14:19:33 Of course, if you drive a gasoline vehicle today, you are supporting the same regimes. Plus putting US soldiers in harms way to defend access to oil.
5075 2018-08-13 14:19:20 In your opinion, how many things would you have to do with that if there was NO PETROLEUM? OIL

5098 2018-08-13 14:16:41 Okay, I’ll give you about 1 minute more. But 1st, you ought to refrain from name calling b/c you actually don’t know what you’re talking about. Oil based products are entirely replaceable with renewables. Your argument that oil will always be required is naïve.
5099 2018-08-13 14:16:38 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...

5101 2018-08-13 14:16:26 Instead of fearing #Turkey and its Islamist Rhetoric as enemy, Oil Rich Countries like #Saudi #Kuwait #UAE #Qatar should show character and come forward for turkey's help in this tough time, time to win a reliable partner, "A FRIEND IN NEED, IS A FRIEND INDEED" #LiraCrisis
5102 2018-08-13 14:16:20 If only most people cared about everyone’s children the way they care about their own. Like the children forced to flee war zones created by our governments (Tories abd Labour) to get cheap oil. We can all do better, we can all show more humanity.

5117 2018-08-13 14:14:39 Because oil runs out at some point and you have to look at the future? Not the first oil producing nation to do so. Qatar / UAE are already focussing on tourism as an income replacement for oil.

5121 2018-08-13 14:14:20 Virtual assets which settle back to the real asset by inference of ownership. It goes on for years in many markets. Oil barrels stay put and their ownership shifts daily from buyer to seller to buyer and back. This is standard derivative play.

5123 2018-08-13 14:14:03 The rupee may continue to suffer due to current account balance. The increase in crude oil prices is having an impact on the economy.

5126 2018-08-13 14:13:51 @elonmusk I thought of you as the hero we needed in the 21st century, now you're ready to take foreign oil money, you change markets with a tweet and accuse heroes of pedophilia. You sound more like Donald Trump and less like the visionary I believed you were. What happened?
5127 2018-08-13 14:13:40 With @elonmusk now acknowledging that the Saudis as prime potential investor for his @Tesla privatization deal, will the Saudis start cutting oil production to drive prices up in order to make #EVs more appealing?
5128 2018-08-13 14:13:40 Right from Balfour the British have always seen Israel as a strategic asset in the Mid East protecting oil supplies and earlier their cotrol of India. Hilariously, John's hero, Tony Blair wanted to be ME UN peace envoy, to help Israel deny Palestinian rights.
5129 2018-08-13 14:13:30 Hmm. Why would the major oil producer want to own the electric car company?  Wait. Wait. I’ve seen this movie.

B. Slow/Squash industry disruption

5137 2018-08-13 14:12:40 Why not encourage the Saudis to invest in solving climate change? Solving this problem is gonna take oil profits being invested in clean solutions! (Minority stake only!)
5138 2018-08-13 14:12:39 Since I’m teleworking, this would be perfect timing to get my oil change.

5141 2018-08-13 14:12:26 US: let’s buy electric cars so we’re not dependent on foreign oil.
Saudi Arabia: Checkmate, fuckers.
5142 2018-08-13 14:12:07 Why would one of the largest oil producer want to buy a much greener and obvious competitor whose initial goal was to rid the world of oil consuming cars? The #Saudi  want o kill electric cars
5143 2018-08-13 14:12:03 It’s egg and oil, Rick.
5144 2018-08-13 14:12:01 Cmon Apple great opportunity to get into the Electric Car Market and make a real contribution to a sustainable green future. Big fan of Musk and Tesla but Saudi oil money  fund example Yemen Middle East Terrorism Human Rights. Give the Norway oil fund a call
5145 2018-08-13 14:11:56 By contrast, the big three mineral exploration companies are still owned by US allies and thus the West still exerts control over a lot of current production; and though US firms no longer control much of the oil market, you are relatively self sufficient.

5148 2018-08-13 14:11:38 sesame oil in salad dressing was a bad idea
5149 2018-08-13 14:11:26 They're hedging against oil and have been doing so in the past years. They know it's a matter of adapt or die.
5150 2018-08-13 14:11:10 And... what to say about u.s. involvement funding the resistance ? Possibly trying to destabilize Maduros cabinet...
Let’s not forget Venezuela sits on some of the largest oil reserves ... and decided to privatize it for protection? Or is that propaganda?

5163 2018-08-13 14:09:26 Actually Canada has immense leverage. We currently supply 40% of America's domestic oil, 50 billion dollars yearly of electric energy to eastern seaboard and water to keep California from starving. We also control supply the bulk of aluminum for the military indistrial complex.

Coconut oil attacks the harmful bacteria in your mouth. It can reduce plaque buildup, prevent tooth decay and fight gum disease.
5165 2018-08-13 14:09:18 No what’s amazing is that tesla is selling out to an oil company. Who wants that money? If Saudi was going to go for a hostile takeover Elon should have leveraged Spacex and went after some us venture money. Instead he sold Tesla out.
5166 2018-08-13 14:09:12 Why? It is the best thing that can happen, if big oil understands the inevitability of nonrenewable sources being depleted and decides to invest ther considerable assets into renewable energy, it ends up being a win for us all.

Clove oil is good for toothache pain, it's the eugenol (an ingredient within clove oil) that provides relief.

Eugenol is a natural anesthetic and antibacterial, and it works well at reducing inflammation in the mouth.

I will probably use tempeh, too.

I will put some vegetables in a container, and I will set the dressing made from mixing soy sauce, mirin[sweet sake], brown rice vinegar, flax seed oil, olive oil, and white miso[fermented soy bean paste] in a blender in a rattling noise.
5183 2018-08-13 14:07:37 Wait - hasn’t big oil been conspiring with the shorts to destroy $TSLA? So that TSLA could be bought at $420/share by the biggest oil there is? Ok, that makes sense.
5184 2018-08-13 14:07:29 The BoD, the JC, Hodge, Freedland, etc, reflect what Philip Roth called 'the shameless vanity of utter fools', and have no real understanding that in supporting Israel they are supporting the interests of the US oil (and arms) industries.
5185 2018-08-13 14:07:26 And the reason why Mute Jared stays is because he has learned to keep his mouth shut in front of Trump and say nothing at all. The only time he talks is when he is trying to bribe oil rich oligarchs for money for his crappy development company.

As you note, people should be careful if making their own edibles and take care to store them properly.

I bought a canned(it sounds like from the old time) peanut butter as a complete product. No sugar or oil are added. It is made only from grinding peanuts with a rattling noise. 

I will make the real peanut butter by grinding peanuts myself from now on.

In return leave your values which conflict with Canadian values at the border or please don't come here expecting us to change. That will never happen. Our freedoms mean more than money or Saudi oil.
5352 2018-08-13 13:49:25 @cmackinlay I have just signed the petition online asking the government to legalise medicinal cannabis in the UK. I hope it isn't going to be restricted to a small amount of patients only. THC's have just as many qualities in this oil as CBD oil does.
5353 2018-08-13 13:49:25 If this is real it has much bigger ramifications for the future of oil than I realised. Awesome 
5354 2018-08-13 13:49:17 It has always been my hope that oil companies and countries would switch focus to green energy so their money would go toward a good cause rather than just pulling more carbon/pollution out of the ground

5409 2018-08-13 13:42:13 But yes, oil exports have increased rapidly. However, I thought the goal was to keep our oil instead of buying from other countries. Energy independence, right?
5410 2018-08-13 13:42:12 I dunno, I think they’re actually seeing beyond oil and wanting to get in quick. Some of their projects have been very forward-thinking.
5411 2018-08-13 13:42:02 Many wars have been fought in the world. Scramble for Africa, mineral wars, oil wars, trade wars. The mother of all wars will be about water.

5412 2018-08-13 13:41:46 A country that wants to keep moving forward, thinks that collaborate with civil society is good. #climatechange is a real challenge and we can not keep thinking that oil has to be the future. Civil society have expertise to face energetic transitions. #energeticgovernance

5432 2018-08-13 13:39:27 โอเคครับ
5433 2018-08-13 13:39:24 By taking the path of least resistance, protesting the Canadian oil industry where their American corporate masters dictate their dirty money should go so their profits aren't interrupted. Useless shills, bought and paid for by the highest bidder...
5434 2018-08-13 13:39:21 @IGcom your platrom is stuck - gold and brent oil prices not moving
5435 2018-08-13 13:39:18 Replacing Saudi Arabia with another importer is quickly done. Their oil is shipped in via tankers.

5445 2018-08-13 13:38:35 I don’t want to burn it!! I will keep it until it morphs into an oil 
5446 2018-08-13 13:38:19 Yeah. Let me know when they stop bringing in oil, gas and distillates by barge. So environmentally unfriendly, doncha know.
5447 2018-08-13 13:38:12 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; You anoint my head with oil; my cup runs over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life; and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.  Psalm 23:5–6

5449 2018-08-13 13:37:59 Right? Or they can “survive” on welfare until they realize you have to work hard to live good. Or be born rich like Trudeau and his oil money.

5456 2018-08-13 13:37:28 Oil has shrunk to an insignificant percentage of electricity generation in the developed world, so there is little or no link between oil companies' market share and people's "energy bills". Maybe you're trying to talk about gas & renewables vs coal competition?

5463 2018-08-13 13:36:53 I could keep sending you articles. Do you own shares in mining or oil/gas?

5468 2018-08-13 13:36:25 Just don't let it dry out on your face and keep it on for 15 minutes. There isn't a one size fit all product that works it's about having a routine that works for your skin. 

Spin brushers are the best tool to maintain healthy healing skin, organic washes, and oil for sealing

5476 2018-08-13 13:35:41 Very light volumes traded in energy equities at US market opening;  the FX panic memo didn't reach out oil equity traders desks. #oott #oil
5477 2018-08-13 13:35:36 Very true. Data is glue.
I think Data is also like crude oil. We have to process it and transform it's form from one state of crude to another state e.g. petrol
So just having lots of data does not help.
What is your saying??

5479 2018-08-13 13:34:57 So the US decides to move to an "energy dominance strategy" & "USD weaponization strategy", where we attempt to sanction certain oil producers out of the market while also squeezing USD liquidity higher in hopes to break what China's doing.  It might work...it might be too late.

I’m not saying that’s not realistic,

But it shoulda been two people fuckin’ next to an open jar of coconut oil.

5493 2018-08-13 13:34:03 India should demand for payment in Indian Rupees like how they pay Iran for American oil. Why should they pay dollars and deplete its forex reserves. Otherwise ignore American sanctions, they are not UN sanctions by the way.

5512 2018-08-13 13:32:23 I saw green veg the other day on his place but it looked like it had been rolled in oil first. Who are these chef's he keeps hiring? Are they trying to kill him?

5531 2018-08-13 13:30:07 Goo Olive oil? HMMMM
5532 2018-08-13 13:29:48 How do we know this is true and what is being done about it, no region oil too.
5533 2018-08-13 13:29:32 Not if they have to travel through oil and mining sludge
5534 2018-08-13 13:29:29 You guna this cleansing oil?
5535 2018-08-13 13:29:01 Agreed, but it's that "if" - around the 2/3 number - that concerns me.  It's not clear that there will be any guarantees.

I have no problem with oil money investing in cleantech - I think we need that to happen - but the Saudi government is problematic.
5536 2018-08-13 13:28:48 China does same all over world w/Saudi, Russia, Angola, Nigeria, Iran, Iraq, etc.  Ditto in copper, other critical inputs.  China never runs out of USD's b/c US can't stop running $300B+ annual deficits v. China, & annual commodity production globally is maybe $1T at $50 oil.
5537 2018-08-13 13:28:32 Bulk order oil seals maybe

5541 2018-08-13 13:28:12 You're a special one Ross. So all the left leaning Tesla buyers will love the fact that the owners of the car they're buying to save the environment are the biggest oil producer who also happen to be amongst the worst human rights offenders in the world.
5542 2018-08-13 13:28:11 What does that guy have in his purse? It looks like he’s about to drop it.
5543 2018-08-13 13:28:04 Naalala ko na naman na gawa daw sa nilutong baby yung baby oil.
5544 2018-08-13 13:27:56 And a close friend’s son is there.  Brilliant engineer who signed onto ROTC to afford a good school.  Clearing ieds of roads for oil trucks.
5545 2018-08-13 13:27:43 as someone who only thinks about getting her oil changed when she's driving, I understand.
5546 2018-08-13 13:27:41 Why take a pre-workout when you can get cocaine for so cheap anymore? Nothing better than talking to an imaginary cat about oil changes while lifting twice your body weight at the gym! #fitfam

5548 2018-08-13 13:27:39 What's does your ridiculous meme have to do with military assets?  Also the oil fields in Scotland are run by private companies.  Companies that John swinney pleaded for the UK government to give a tax break.

5554 2018-08-13 13:26:59 Fair point, it’s just annoying when I could get other pain relief such as ibuprofen for around a couple of quid a month but it isn’t good for you longterm. Can’t praise CBD oil enough though.
5555 2018-08-13 13:26:59 Me. Sorry had him DFS. Of course he hits a rogue object that busts an oil pain entering a turn at 215

5560 2018-08-13 13:26:18 Interesting article, palm oil production is indeed on the rise and it is essential to empower consumers to make the right purchase decisions to encourage companies to source sustainable palm oil. CSPO now accounts for 19% of global palm oil (not 17% as mentioned in the article).
5561 2018-08-13 13:25:43 Seriously Net Spending? Chelsea funded by an Oligarch. Man City funded by Oil Money. United are shit and have the best commercial deals in the world.
5562 2018-08-13 13:25:34 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. Surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

5565 2018-08-13 13:24:38 Its not the UK's oil at all as if scotland was a independent country the oil would be in Scottish waters making it SCOTTISH oil. Nowhere does it state when the UK was formed would it become a country so as it currently stands the UK is illegal therefore is not a country
5566 2018-08-13 13:24:38 This message brought to you by the biggest of "Big Oil".  Also, he has no doubt increased the total Saudi transaction cost.

5581 2018-08-13 13:23:17 あとにハマったんだけど、箱だからまとめて集めたい(かねない)
5582 2018-08-13 13:23:16 lemme tell-ya all if the economy is on the edge of tanking sooner or later which it will because of the rising oil prices & the POTUS Factor just as the Turkish Lira has echoing the Asian Currency Crisis of 1997 when the Rupiah lost 99% of it's value so spare me the "optics" 1/2
5583 2018-08-13 13:23:16 It's on track to becoming a reality. The us will become the world's largest oil producer.  The Saudis know this and are trying to diversify there assets.
5584 2018-08-13 13:23:03 Saudi Arabia trims oil production despite vow to increase output #financialtimes
5585 2018-08-13 13:22:59 If renewable energy is so abundant and cheap, then surely it does not need a carbon tax or any other subsidy to prop it up vis-a-vis coal/oil/gas. Is this correct? Bring it to the market test.
5586 2018-08-13 13:22:58 เคยไม่ชาร์ตบ่อยๆดู มันอยู่ได้เกินวันเลยนะ นี่งงมาก สรุปดี หรือ ไม่ดี
5587 2018-08-13 13:22:58 I went to Valvoline for an oil change and my battery died out of nowhere while I was next in line. They had to jump me so I could pull in. My life is like constantly so humiliating 
5588 2018-08-13 13:22:39 Please extend this conviction to their Sponsors and the Security men who aid this illegal immigrants in the oil industry.
5589 2018-08-13 13:22:36 i'm really scared about how fucked the environment is but the people who can change it don't care because it's easier to drive an oil tanker through a lifeless ocean with propellers strong enough to cut through all the plastic
5590 2018-08-13 13:22:31 guess we should not have lifted our oil export ban huh mr dean
5591 2018-08-13 13:22:31 It reads like something a bunch of talented lawyers draft to try and minimize the SEC damage for their client. Saudi's have him over a (oil) barrel because if they say 'meeting comment was throw away, no intention to deal', the yogurt gets deeper.
5592 2018-08-13 13:22:25 The peteodollar. If the US discontinues it’s support of Saudi Arabia they (and other opec nations) may change the currency in which they sell their oil which would be devestating to the green back.
5593 2018-08-13 13:22:16 แต่มันเล่นแล้วลื่นนะ ไม่ค่อยค้าง แล้ว้อดีของมันเลย แบตอยู่ได้นานมากกกกกกก แต่นี่เป็นนิสัยชอบชาร์ตแบต 50% คือชาร์ตละ บ้าบอ
5594 2018-08-13 13:22:09 @Asad_Umar before reaching out to Iran for oil pipeline to China. Please put pipeline (undersea) idea to Saudi Arabia and UAE. If they don't come aboard than try Iran. Reason being SA & UAE always helped Pakistan in need. Built a refinery at Gawadar import crude & export VAP.

5599 2018-08-13 13:21:53 Why would the oil rich Saudis be interested in helping an electric car company survive?
5600 2018-08-13 13:21:44 Hi just a reminder that CBD oil is not the same as the cannabis you smoke.. The CBD oil safe for your pet *should* use hemp as it has low levels of THC and the high THC in weed you smoke is actually very toxic to pets. Dont blow smoke in their face or feed them your weed.
5601 2018-08-13 13:21:38 Saudis want kill Tesla:
If my economy based from export only oil around the world, there is company want to replace oil/gas car's to electricity,
this is treating there economy, so they want control and limit production of cars to minimum or kill the idea of elecric car.

They are doomed. We will be better to walk away, WTO. We have over 40 countries want trade deals. Leave means leave.

5655 2018-08-13 13:16:06 Remember Venezuela, in Zulia one of the states with more oil, has been without electricity for more than 72 hours, in Amazon flood has cover 50% of the state and the mafia government does nothing, also in Bolivar is a ecocide to find gold. We need help to get rid of this tyranny!
5656 2018-08-13 13:16:05 The "race to spend 1st" has been happening for 5 yrs.  "You take the USD's, we'll take the oil/copper/gold/gas/equities, etc."  My sense is China would not launch a CNY oil contract unless it felt like it had sufficient control of oil supplies to support it.

5692 2018-08-13 13:12:40 Scots wouldn't spend over £3bn on defence. Smaller countries have strong military on costs around £1.5 bn.  Given our huge expanse of waters/oil rigs why does Scotland not have patrol boats for our coatlines? 1/2
5693 2018-08-13 13:12:34 Whosoever is pulling this string is a 'torturist'.

it's more complex than what most average brains are applauding.

It's cash dependent, any slip/crash in major income (oil) will throw the over dependent into slavery.

Its a deadly and boomeranging cornerstone strategy.

5708 2018-08-13 13:11:06 Saudi interest in $TSLA is more than just a sovereign fund stake. US shale industry needs oil to be over $50 to break even. If Tesla takes over auto market, you could cut oil demand, drop the price, and force US fracking industry out of business.

5713 2018-08-13 13:10:53 The $dollar$ hegemony persists for obvious structural, political and militaristic reasons.

Commodities are priced in $$, mainly oil. The largest reserves in sovereign vaults are in $$. US is the largest consumer in the world with plenty of $$ to spend. Dont forget the military.

5991 2018-08-13 12:39:09 No, you are absurd. Your attempt to divide Americans is not working, no matter how much propaganda your editors at the Post allow, How bereft is an ideology that cannot argue for its existence, except to divide people to hate one another? Americans are not buying your snake oil.

6006 2018-08-13 12:36:44 Life after oil needs the political institutions to be powerful enough, such as Constitution, Parliament and independent judiciary.

6042 2018-08-13 12:31:16 Last night i climbed down an open sewer grate and wandered around just taking it all in. It sucked. Paula Deen was down there spraying everything with cooking oil repeating "this gonna look so good when it's finished"
6043 2018-08-13 12:31:11 Same oil & gas ‘donors’ here as Canada. Same racist agenda & lack of regard for progress.
6044 2018-08-13 12:31:09 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, however criminal aliens.

6048 2018-08-13 12:30:53 The two other comparable Nordic countries, Finland and Sweden, which chose to join the EU, have also lived with it in great prosperity for two decades with little regret or political opposition. Norway was always a special case because of its oil.

6060 2018-08-13 12:29:01 I'm lucky to be able to buy my oil direct from the grower.  Many ancient and organic groves are still farmed in the old ways as the types of olives/and or situation make them uneconomic for large scale commerical venture. When I run our I rarely buy Italian.....
6061 2018-08-13 12:28:57 (と思ったけど金曜日か 県外辛そうやな)(でもぱっとオススメできる店がないんじゃ)
6062 2018-08-13 12:28:55 Yeah it’s a carrier oil. Tea tree oil by itself can be very strong. Coconut oil works well as a carrier oil. I use it down there too sometimes.
6063 2018-08-13 12:28:54 nilagay ko na lahat sa kamay ko oil, vinegar, alcohol, ice at kung ano ano pa para lang maalis yung init wala pa ring epekto, parang yung ibinigay mo na nga lahat ‘di pa rin sapat.

6075 2018-08-13 12:27:28 Duterte administration asks oil companies to import Euro 2 diesel because it is cheaper than the new and cleaner Euro 4. Kung di ba naman mga inutil ang gagong administrasyong ito. Di ba project nyo yung modernization ng PUVs at gusto nyo pa nga Euro 4 ang engines nila?
6076 2018-08-13 12:27:23 Just had my bi annual baby oil bath and my skin feels back to 0. Thank Christ
6077 2018-08-13 12:27:04 Sure.  Now, where's all that oil and gas that Norway had when they started down this path decades ago...
6078 2018-08-13 12:26:57 GAS
Scottish waters produce ~25.5m tonnes of oil equivalent
= 296.5 tWh
Total Scottish gas consumption 66.3 tWh
Surplus = 450%
6079 2018-08-13 12:26:53 A snake oil salesmen hiding behind religion using his pulpit for political gain. This is why churches should loose tax free status. Let them us tax free for true charitable activities.

6092 2018-08-13 12:25:27 Omar wants free college, free medicare for all. free housing for all. No gasoline, no home heating oil!!  Holy HELL! I'm not working my ass off to provide all this to total strangers who are sprawled on their couch watching TV all day!!  I'd quit my job first.
6093 2018-08-13 12:25:25 I have no idea about what Putin and Merkel will take about. I could only guess it has to do with Iran, Syria and the oil Merkel gets from Putin.

6095 2018-08-13 12:25:16 @thomasinamiers Hi, is the chilli oil you have  recently started using in the Guacamole and Broccoli made using Asian ingredients?  Seems different to Mexican flavours?
6096 2018-08-13 12:25:12 It defines what's wrong with journalism today.  Selling snake oil as news.  Where's the search for truth and facts.  This is all feelings- of entitlement, hate and twisted love.  Y'all  confirmed you find some news boring so you cover fashion and I guess family drama 2 ad nauseum

6099 2018-08-13 12:24:47 No. The oil burning tiki torches were replaced by led candles and natural gas lighters; they’re more economical now.
6100 2018-08-13 12:24:41 Difference for me was the maintenance. Honda Civic oil change every 15k-$61. Mazda every 8k-$90. 6.2 l/100kms.

6108 2018-08-13 12:23:46 the book ignores until the 1960s dominant model of agricultural development was: we do the land reform, small owners will intensify agriculture, will increase consumption of manufactured goods, not weight on balance of payments by importing expensive machinery and oil (approx)
6109 2018-08-13 12:23:39 My oil change is like 168 at the dealer.  
6110 2018-08-13 12:23:25 Will Greenpeace acknowledge their part in the palm oil fiasco, by supporting biofuel initiatives in the 1990s and early 2000s?
6111 2018-08-13 12:23:23 Expect, crude oil fall below $66.
6112 2018-08-13 12:23:15 @fssaiindia Infact they pack Olive Pomace Oil but label it as Olive Oil.  Complete addresses already sent. They have distributed their packings throughout South India. My complaint since 2016 unattended to.
6113 2018-08-13 12:23:13 काळजी नसावी. आपले डॉलर हे सर्वात जास्त तेल आयात करण्यासाठी ख़र्च होतात. काल नाल्यातून गैस कसा वापरला जावू शकतो याची कल्पना PM नी शास्त्रज्ञना दिली आहे. ते संशोधन करतील आणि काही दिवसानंतर आपण गैस बाबत आत्मनिर्भर होवु आणि oil आयात कमी होईल. आणि आपले डॉलर वाचतील आणि रुपया सुधारेल 
6114 2018-08-13 12:23:12 I can't understand what is wrong with Trump and the US. They deal with the House of Saud who are responsible for a whole ton of crap in the world. But Iran is public enemy no1 just because they didn't share oil with the US Cos. Trump seems hell bent of f*ing all US relationships.
6115 2018-08-13 12:23:09 2 and a half years and still oil and water
6116 2018-08-13 12:23:07 One palm oil company has destroyed an area of forest half the size of Paris. 

PepsiCo, Mars, Nestle, Unilever - companies that have promised not to buy palm oil from forest destroyers - are all supporting the destruction.

6117 2018-08-13 12:23:04 The problem is we've wasted so much oil money while Norway invested theirs in infrastructure and a wealth fund. Just compare their roads to ours.

6119 2018-08-13 12:22:55 Omg I drink it every morning it's the best. I do 2 tablespoons of butter, one tablespoon of MCT oil, 2 tablespoons of heavy whipping cream, one scoop collagen powder, and 8 oz of coffee

6125 2018-08-13 12:22:17 You want to get tough on fundamentalists, you don't turn away people fleeing beheadings or poison gas. You get tough on Saudi Arabia for financing extremists schools and mosques and you tell them to keep their oil.
6126 2018-08-13 12:22:13 i finally found my oil burner! yaaas
6127 2018-08-13 12:22:09 I'm planning a trip to buy new foundation today. I've decided to start a quest for makeup that doesn't make my face look like an oil slick after an hour.

I always feel more like taking on the world when I feel cute. 
6128 2018-08-13 12:22:06 @F150Fans Had my first scheduled oil change at Pines Ford in Broward Co. The very next day, OIL ALL OVER THE PLACE. Oil pan apparently sprung a leak (at least that's what the Ford Service Rep is telling me). 

Anyone else experience the same?

6132 2018-08-13 12:21:43 @fssaiindia tks for your clarrification. But two repackers of Olive oil from Bangalore have not mentioned the importers name but flouting label regulations distributing their products. From 2016 I have been approaching FSSAI at ,Bangalore, but till now no one has taken action
6133 2018-08-13 12:21:34 Stop blaming my friend for your and my problems in the material world.

The pure is aloof from the impure just as oil and water don't mix.

The material world is separated, at the bottom, watery.

6163 2018-08-13 12:17:31 Well, I can tell you that my way of Albertan life has been affected in the last 4 years & it has nothing to do with oil.

It has everything to do with taxes & the East robbing us of our hard earned income. I don't feel entitled & diversity is not our strength.
6164 2018-08-13 12:17:28 Lobbying to shut down other ports in the country or dredge it to make active! So don’t tell me about oil and all! Power resides at the center, if you don’t want to believe it, that’s your business. But to reinforce failure in all levels of Government will forever....

6256 2018-08-13 12:04:42 I know I'm stupid but if private companies can make huge profits out of water, gas. oil, banks, electricity, insurance, trains, busses, roads, banks, mining, telephones, the internet then why do we tax-payers have share in these busineses?
6257 2018-08-13 12:04:39 All I can do is again confirm that I have personally witnessed people successfully fight cancer, amongst other conditions, with cannabis oil.. A lot of people.. Some, not all, turn to cannabis oil because accepted medicine i.e chemo has said that no more can be done for them..
6258 2018-08-13 12:04:21 So mitigation of the loss of tax revenue due to the crash in oil price isn't a positive, unfettered free trade and movement of goods isn't a good thing, a central bank isn't a good thing, our own currency isn't a good thing and many many many more, have a word mate eh.
6259 2018-08-13 12:04:18 Huh. Interesting development. We’ll see if currency exchange works with oil and gas.
6260 2018-08-13 12:04:17 @walizahid sir! I got 2 question.

1. Why is rumors spreading things such as water crises?

2. What will happen to the countries in future round about 2050 which are the producers of oil?

Oil price is not even impacting their own economy

- further cut in holdings of U.S. securities
- more transactions in national currencies, including #ruble, #euro, #yuan, etc
- shift to other currencies in #oil deals…
6274 2018-08-13 12:01:37 That's 7.2% in nominal USD terms, which should not be confused with growth in real terms. Depending on oil prices and currency movements, Nigerian nominal USD growth could/should easily average well above 7.0%. 2000-2014 average growth was 19.5% in nominal USD terms.

EM crisis will affect the demand of oil
Oil price going down

Watch the US shale producers
6281 2018-08-13 12:00:53 Sorry just a few more comments:
The American people have been brainwashed the last 40yrs

6286 2018-08-13 12:00:18 Use of #palmoil for #biodiesel in the EU was 3.35 Million tonnes in 2015. In 2016 about 45% of palm oil imported to the EU was for biodiesel, needing around 1 million hectares of tropical land. The 3 largest producers of palm oil biodiesel were Italy, Spain and the Netherlands
6287 2018-08-13 12:00:03 Today I slightly dropped. #Oil #Brent 72.83$ (-0.12)
6288 2018-08-13 12:00:00 Likely not as badly as those to raise oil product retail prices to maintain margins.

6293 2018-08-13 11:59:10 That's interesting. Thanks for the extra info. Without avoiding palm oil, how can we make better buying decisions as consumers? How can we distinguish between the good stuff and the dirty stuff in ingredients lists?
6294 2018-08-13 11:58:30 Thank you น้าาาา

6310 2018-08-13 11:56:08 Long term I would agree 100%. But in the short term, I view it differently.

It’s like Saudi Arabia bringing their MASSIVE state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco public in 2019. Long term, I wouldn’t own oil, but in the short term, the Saudis won’t let it crash until their IPO.
6311 2018-08-13 11:55:51 This is a good idea! I’m gonna use wire wool and peppermint oil and stuff then if they won’t budge I can phone and ask for non-poison help.

6323 2018-08-13 11:54:13 seriously: oil and petrochemical flaks working right wing circles for so long — at least since 70s — that it seems like the natural order. the demon was called “global warming” back then.

6360 2018-08-13 11:47:45 In case you missed it yesterday, you can save $8 off our full-service oil change at participating locations today thanks to the Atlanta @Braves!!
6361 2018-08-13 11:47:26 I take it therefore that we should sue every company that has ever produced any petrochemical, on your same basis. Perhaps every human being is due $269m as oil companies are profiteering from selling a product that hasnt “possibly”caused death...but “actually” has caused death!!

6380 2018-08-13 11:44:12 Sign of the times. At home we only cook in coconut oil & try to avoid carbs, but can’t see myself ever requesting it when we visit friends for dinner. Would feel a bit self indulgent.

6403 2018-08-13 11:40:34 Eating Cow GOBAR does this to your mind.....You can fantasize as much as you want but the facts remain uncontested. Pakistan is smaller than Maharashtara and still occupies TWO Indian states Kashmir and GB...hahaha..Long Live Saudis who gave us free oil for testing NUKES.
6404 2018-08-13 11:40:27 Wait a moment! If Clair, discovered in 2015 was the largest ever Scottish oil field discovered, this one must be the latest "Largest EVER"? Why does the story add "for twenty years" making finds appear rarer than they actually are?
6405 2018-08-13 11:40:23 ああ、これはまずい。実にまずい。0.1トン超えたよ。
6406 2018-08-13 11:40:18 Yes. Although I’ll say “guessed well”. Because Tories & Labour were campaigning for either outcome, and because it was clear as a nose on a face that there was no plan whatsoever (none mooted by Leave, besides Hannan’s snake oil). Boris face on TV on 24/06/16 summed it perfectly.

6411 2018-08-13 11:39:46 This is where it’s gets really complicated and I do not profess to have enough knowledge to speak wisely about it. From what I understand the saudis made an oil deal with the US, Iranians refused. Now SA were American backed against their arch enemies the Iranians.
6412 2018-08-13 11:39:41 they are Leprosy.  All of them are fighting each other for countries that do not care about them at all and want only oil and money

6414 2018-08-13 11:39:31 okay,  i work in the oil industry so i have seen the price build up many times. But why do you say international crude oil prices have no impact on our local prices ?
6415 2018-08-13 11:38:58 True. Didn’t say the animation was about boycotting though  Just my voice  Can all be inspired to stop using it. Haven’t Iceland recently said no to palm oil in their products?
6416 2018-08-13 11:38:46 et 2) Représenter l'histoire énergétique en valeurs relatives plutôt qu'en valeurs absolues tend à faire oublier que les dynamiques passées sont faites d'additions et non de transitions entre les sources

6422 2018-08-13 11:38:26 So after some hounding by my sister, i am trying out CBD oil supplements--they arrived Friday, and it's been one a day.

6426 2018-08-13 11:37:25 #oilandgas @JustinTrudeau Energy East is important to stop US NAFTA BULLYING.  Stop importing Saudi Arabian oil and build Canadian Refineries.  Export our oil and gas to Europe to lessen Soviet dependence  in Germany.

6449 2018-08-13 11:32:01 Cripple? All oil economists say that the amount of oil we import from KSA is a nit (approx 10% of total imports) and can easily be replaced by US. What I don’t understand is why we seem to want to repair the rift? Take the oil from US, make it part of NAFTA.

6477 2018-08-13 11:28:24 The root cause of this for us is a lack of USD liquidity caused by the triumvirate of higher oil, Fed QT and growing US budget deficits.

6478 2018-08-13 11:28:15 I'm guessing the #brexit Norwegian option is where we invent time machine, go back in time to stop oil revenue being given away as tax cuts, invest in sovereign wealth fund instead and end up with the largest such fund in world like Norway has now. Yep, we are just like Norway...

6690 2018-08-13 10:55:00 What you are saying is that successive UK governments from all parties have squandered North Sea oil riches on useless vanity projects, while the Norwegians were intelligent enough to realize it would not last and invested the money. Really tells you all you need to know about UK
6691 2018-08-13 10:54:45 @UKenyatta i know your position is heavily tasking.

6745 2018-08-13 10:47:47 There is already talk of lower oil production and higher capex. This is likely due to higher depletion. The same is also the case for natgas. We will soon find out how strong this trend is.

I would like to follow up any update regarding my landline at home # +6326607349 located at 313 Palm Oil Street, Palmera Hills 1, Taytay, Rizal because up to now still not yet repair since August 8, 2018. Your 171 nobody answer only machine. Action please..

6830 2018-08-13 10:32:14 Right; But What Is New In That? Oil Compnies Are Already Doing That. They Can Store It From Stinky Drains Too...But For That Lot Of Infrastrutre Is Needed..........Thanks.
6831 2018-08-13 10:31:55 Its surviving on production cuts & sanctions by U.S,,  since they started exporting oil n gas!
6832 2018-08-13 10:31:15 Exceptionally cranky after my oil delivery for the house failed this morning, after minimal sleep. However, Inter-bloody-stellar. A narrative that went everywhere I didn't expect it to - few bits gripped the heart strings, and Zimmer's work was a sublime partnership
6833 2018-08-13 10:31:08 less needed now as all the big oil firms buy up charge firms.

6841 2018-08-13 10:29:39 What does work is companies taking ownership and realizing its actually less expensive and better to run clean operations and good housekeeping training. Start clean stay clean. Cheaper to handle oil and fuel correctly vs expensive pick it up off the ground mentality.

Is there a study or news reports, data and other information ( testimonies) available to support this? (I'm not denying but would like to understand what may have happened)
6849 2018-08-13 10:28:08 Day 8 and I’m even craving kebabs and ain’t had one of those in like 12 years! They prob taste like fatty oil but I seem not to care... soon lunch time and I get to have a shake... yay...

6860 2018-08-13 10:26:19 Its funny you mentioned environmental because I happen to work in the oil industry and I see daily where environmental concerns are ignored by believe it or not the Government employees who dont want to be bothered by extra work of holding companies accountable.
6861 2018-08-13 10:26:12 oil aint going anywhere IMHO... the price will indications of that long before it happens
6862 2018-08-13 10:26:10 Maybe stop spilling oil all over the fucking seas and I might listen to you. Maybe pay taxes properly be less of a twat and I might sign up for your bollocks scheme. Lol jokes. I welcome the folk who drive away without paying. They only affects t your profits.

6868 2018-08-13 10:24:48 @waleadekoya22 how will Solomon say 80% of cassava that come into Lagos is mostly from isoko and Edo?, have you forgotten the core eastern states that are known basically for food items like cassava (fufu),palm oil etc. Solomon take time ooo!. 
6869 2018-08-13 10:24:37 it’s just their endowment bias. i will be more worried what happens to oil producing economies. after oil goes away, every bomb from there will lead to 10% correction in nifty ;)

6874 2018-08-13 10:23:57 @KJAlphons u had told to public of Kerala fund has already released by centre Rs 100 core. Can fund full fill d requirements which damaged more than Rs 100 core.

6877 2018-08-13 10:23:11 Lib-Cons are two sides of the same corrupt coin. They both prioritise the same core values: minimal climate action, Big Oil subsidies, and tax havens for billionaires. Time to stop parroting MSM's mission to exaggerate the minimal distinctions between the two. #cdnpoli

6883 2018-08-13 10:22:48 I’m obviously not an economist, but I do drive a car pretty well. So I hear people in govt saying we are now the largest oil & gas producers in the world, and are selling it. Gas here in the US should be about $1 a gallon, why isn’t that so?
6884 2018-08-13 10:22:47 If the government came along and started subsidising the purchase of deep friers, mandated a minimum number of fastfood restaurants per area, helped install/support many authoritarian governments overseas to maintain a cheap supply of canola/vegetable/palm oil and so on...
6885 2018-08-13 10:22:35 Vegetable oil contains soybean oil. It’s likely a blend of soy, canola, sunflower, etc.  And yes, mayo is delish.

If you have Extra Extra Olive Oil in a Salad once a week, that will keep your tubes clear. Its a bit like a Sewer blocked with a large fat ball. Just requires a bit of a shove?
6894 2018-08-13 10:20:36 naw it’s no me!! It’s my maw she won’t buy normal oil  I’ll have to go shopping myself

6896 2018-08-13 10:20:18 And like most of the top you p play video games all day, make slime and add noting to our economy. This is why you guys beg for mindless factory jobs. It's also why dems run most science, medicine, arts, tech, law, media, finance in the US. You guys can dig oil holes I guess
6897 2018-08-13 10:20:17 Big customer to the US, while how the weapons are used receive a blind eye. Russia's affiliation is more along the lines of manipulation of oil production & prices. Lots of dirty business among the trio, hence the words 'mutual friend'.
6898 2018-08-13 10:20:05 The markets have risen once more, responding to a rise in Oil as the markets react to the US sanctions on Iran, fearing a shortage of supply as a result. The Coal and Carbon markets also rose in price throughout the session.
6899 2018-08-13 10:19:40 I’ve literally just been lathering my hairless dogs up with coconut oil and wiping away their blackheads for like 2 hours.... strangely satisfying.  I’m sure the dogs feel better and moisturized.

6905 2018-08-13 10:18:05 I’m pretty sure it’s about the fat content so you might be okay? I’ve seen people do it with coconut oil too

6907 2018-08-13 10:17:36 I'm 60:40 on that (the coward's ratio). While Erdogan is stubborn does he *really* want to tweak America's nose over Iranian oil. Net net getting back on an even keel with US going to do more good for his economy than saving a few $$$ on crude imports

6922 2018-08-13 10:15:00 SA dramatically lowered the commodity cost of oil to maintain market share in the face of disruptive rapid expansion of low cost US oil and gas production. The “Canadaian” oil supply chain requires restructuring including regulatory to meet their market challengers.

Meanwhile fry lots of garlic and chilli in 1-2 tbsp oil. Drain pasta and broccoli. Toss in oil. Add salt
6941 2018-08-13 10:12:23 I work in the hydroponic industry in the UK and have personally seen people use oil to combat tumors and many other conditions.. Getting the right strain for the condition is key.. I grow my own medicine and use it to treat my o.c.d/Tourettes, glaucoma and for pain relief..

6955 2018-08-13 10:10:26 Oh indeed. I'm making no judgement (yet) on whether Turkey's travails will start leaking into oil. It just reminded me of pre-peak crisis when 'decoupling' was the bulls' favourite argument... until it wasn't.

At moment, in oil, all eyes remain on Iran...
6956 2018-08-13 10:10:23 And coating the whole lot in garlic and chilli oil and salt makes it delicious whether you like broccoli or not.

6987 2018-08-13 10:04:25 Oil will be mainly a supply story...If demand grows slower or faster it is not going to matter much. In general oil demand grows every year and that is what matters.

7042 2018-08-13 09:56:06 That all time high triggered a global recession. When crude oil becomes that much high, economic activity grinds to a halt as every other price also increase since the fossil fuel is embedded at every link of the global value addition chain.

7125 2018-08-13 09:41:39 @LAYS Why are you using palm oil in you products? Can't you read? Palm oil can cause cancer!!
7126 2018-08-13 09:41:23 They spent over 37 billion oil revenues. Increased our debt by 8 billion and nearly bankrupted us. Gave us burden of MRat falls. Only a fool would vote for them again.

7135 2018-08-13 09:40:27 I have, but I can find no decent sized RCTs which prove anything significant. All I'm getting are suggestions of treatments without evidence. Therefore, there is no proof that cannabis oil is a solution to cancer, which is the assertion of the first tweet to which I responded.

7140 2018-08-13 09:38:41 No, Sir Ian Wood, the oil industry's top expert, as my previous attachment lays out. There is only 15 odd years of profitable oil left.
7141 2018-08-13 09:37:49 Aside the point about OJ & fracking, neither the US nor Canada is at all dependent on Saudi oil.
7142 2018-08-13 09:37:22 #ANGS will keep going down as traders r still ramping it on top of Bergen’s dumping

Without fracking tight oil fields won’t produce much, look at Lidsey, produced only 2 barrels in April 2018! SP is yet to fall further IMO

7160 2018-08-13 09:33:53 My theory about development is that a country needs a reason to develop. A reason that will urge politicians to agree to be rational to a large extent. We don’t have that reason, we have oil , we are “giant of Africa”. We aren’t at war with our neighbors.

7167 2018-08-13 09:32:12 Hi Jules, to cook the leaves and stalks, chop them into small pieces and put them in a heavy based frying pan with a little olive oil and chopped garlic. Cook and stir for around 5 minutes before adding a squeeze of lemon and seasoning, both to taste. Enjoy!

Eat either LCHF  Low carb, high fat ( animal/ fruit oil,)
or eat  HCLF   High carb  very low fat ((fruil oil ) wth  very high protein ( offals shellfish). 
Don't  average the two & either way  don't eat seed oils, sugar & grain
7170 2018-08-13 09:31:19 That’s why they look into Iran’s oil reserve
7171 2018-08-13 09:30:53 Exfoliate your face, neck and hands with a mixture of baking soda and olive oil. It is very gentle, and keeps skin very soft and smooth.

7179 2018-08-13 09:29:01 "Oil" is the favorite word of people building online dating profiles in the U.S. states of Texas, Oklahoma, and North Dakota.
7180 2018-08-13 09:28:58 @LAYS why do you use palm oil in you products? It is shameful! You are poisoning us!
7181 2018-08-13 09:28:52 Two things. (A) There is no oil left (see reply to Dennis Healy meme below for details. 
(B) Yes, you will need a currency and it can't be Sterling as that would mean that the rUK  would control Scotland's fiscal policy and that wouldn't be real independence.
7182 2018-08-13 09:28:39 Unless it’s passed me by, we are not indy. It’s has to date been the U.K.s oil - the GERS figures produced to show how things would be IF we were indy, we aren’t- so your point is, well, pointless.
7183 2018-08-13 09:28:37 Yes, you can eat eggs I know Mara I’m going to make the omelet with unhealthy oil? Sharp I boil the Cabbage or whatnot what do I eat the cabbage with?

7187 2018-08-13 09:27:50 It wasn't even reporting. McCallum was only there to undermine the eight Mayors & pour oil on the racist fires that his organisation promotes. Sickening.
7188 2018-08-13 09:27:45 Saudis have been running out of oil for years. Their percentage use of what is known as "water cut" has been increasing for their known fields. A sign of rapid depletion. And announcements by Saudis of transitioning their economy away from oil should be a wake up call too.
7189 2018-08-13 09:27:33 While US doubles down on oil, steel and coal (buggywhips, anyone?)
7190 2018-08-13 09:26:46 Stopping quantities of methane is as easy as not eating meat a couple of times a week. This buys us the time to re engineer the soon to be 2 billion cars and the growing oil and gas emissions (and the quadrupling of flying projected)

7198 2018-08-13 09:25:18 Eggs are healthy. Bread isn't. Remember that omelet thing we made at dessert walk? Just three eggs and water and there were other things but that could be anything. Healthy

It's how you prepare your food. Boiling is Everything. And oil can be managed regardless of the brand.

7245 2018-08-13 09:16:13 I use those and beef suet but I do use  cold pressed rapeseed oil for cooking. And it's produced on our farms. I wonder how many people are aware of how 'healthy' oils are produced?

That's exactly how politicians think of their people. They just traded another difficult 4 yrs.

There are a large number of orgs along the supply chain committed to transforming the industry, from oil palm growers to NGOs. We hope 1/3

7421 2018-08-13 08:37:05 Very interesting 

I’m reminded of this one time I asked my Libyan professor if there was a way to convert oil to gold directly - he told me that without a denominated currency, you can’t do direct oil-to-gold transactions.

I imagine quality plays a huge role in this

7550 2018-08-13 08:13:26 Great, now Canada can focus on developing and refurbishing infrastructure to produce and process it's own natural resources, and be independent of Saudi oil. Sounds like a win.

7552 2018-08-13 08:12:58 Unfortunately very true - cheap oil, arms sales and the resulting profits are the real reasons why war has been going on for decades in the Middle East .

7555 2018-08-13 08:12:08 Really? There were many reasons for our struggle in the 1970s - global oil markets and the reconfiguration of our economy from a lost empire to European orientated trading. If anything, our EU membership helped to stabilise things.
7556 2018-08-13 08:12:02 So just to clarify: scientists who talk about renewable energy = doing it for the money. Oil companies = paying their lobbyists for altruistic purposes. Does that sound correct?

7621 2018-08-13 07:59:00 Big part of the problem with #RSPO #palmoil is their successful efforts to avoid labelling of products. Because of a lack of labelling transparency there is no way for consumers to prioritise RSPO-certified palm oil. There's no market advantage for companies to use it in products

1 Our politicians, when our economies stalled in the 80s, gave them an open door to invest in our economies
2 The Gulf realised that oil will eventually run out, they invested not just in markets but in control of our politicians that gave them a say in our policies
7697 2018-08-13 07:48:09 On GMS they were discussing too. However, guest (proffrom RGU oil and gas centre) said there’s about a third left (that they have sight of). So to say it’s running out is true but same as saying a football game is finishing 15 mins into 2nd half.

7803 2018-08-13 07:25:05 I can agree with that, since seeking to control/overtake a nation would inherently include all its resources. 
I was really just reacting out of my own frustration of hearing, for the past 2-3 decades, that every skirmish the US gets involved in is “all about the oil.”

7820 2018-08-13 07:21:24 Oil prices determine our economy in Nigeria. I'm getting tired of educating these people.
7821 2018-08-13 07:21:21 Yes, and they foolishly saved so much of the money they've been making from North Sea oil & gas, invested it in their country's infrastructure and services, and they're still saving - unlike other foolish countries that had it all, and spent foolishly?
7822 2018-08-13 07:20:40 Some of the oil web sites I've been visiting lately are now predicting oil at $120 per barrel within the next 12 months.
7823 2018-08-13 07:20:29 i ngaruh, bun, 2 bulan ini tida ada breakout, ada pun cuma hiji dan cpt sembu tp kulit jd kering, makanya i duetin sama bio oil

7828 2018-08-13 07:19:59 Enough with too much sweets and oil. Hay. 
7829 2018-08-13 07:19:47 That's bullshit, of course. Canadian "oil" is priced at 20-30% lower than the world price because it isn't oil but bitumen which can't be refined in Alberta because no new refineries have been built there since the 1980s. The world price is for refined oil not bitumen. #cdnpoli
7830 2018-08-13 07:19:46 What's off the scale in Omega 6 is 'vegetable oil' that just about everything is cooked in. All to save us from the 'killer' saturated fat.(Which never killed anybody).
7831 2018-08-13 07:19:43 Yeah! It’s just thick layers of oil paint with no thinners in it. Used a brush going wet into wet for the textures

7835 2018-08-13 07:19:13 Agreed, but I did mean as a complete species. Why are we squabbling over the land, oil, religion. I can't wait for oil to run out, I am an atheist but if you need a book to tell you how to behave then you have issues and can't we share the little inhabital land we have?

7843 2018-08-13 07:17:14 The developing 3rd world is not going to be buying expensive electric cars. They'll be buying low cost petrol cars that have a support and fueling infrastructure in place already. Why do you think Western countries are outlawing petrol cars? This is how you're being given oil.

7845 2018-08-13 07:17:04 President Bush and Cheney used Saddam as an excuse to take Iraq oil. Condelezza Rice showed the UN a piece of pipe claiming it was from a nuclear reactor. Your description of conservatives is stereotyping, all conservatives. Not.

Why not take a stand for Cdn workers and support EE and refining more oil in Cda.  When you said no to EE you said yes to XL and American hegemony over Cdn oil.

The facts are EE was both for export and for Eastern refineries.  

If you agree with more cdn oil being refined in Cda that's a good thing.

7946 2018-08-13 06:57:31 I had to take another filet out put some oil all up on the pan. You was gonna have me pushing all these crazy buttons, no I can have some sugar fish tacos.
7947 2018-08-13 06:57:30 btw I use truffle oil at times too, I just have learnt better than to mention it to chefs. It's a bit like asking for salt for their "perfectly seasoned" food. Like Nico Ladenis who threw customers out for that offence! Do you remember him? Explosive! 
7948 2018-08-13 06:57:11 Agribusiness is very important, but Nigeria could surely make most rapid progress towards becoming a middle income tiger economy if it fixed weaknesses in its oil & gas industry
7949 2018-08-13 06:56:49 If it can sustain itself without oil, good luck and good bye, zulians always talk about secession because they have oil, take that away and can they still be self sufficient?

7953 2018-08-13 06:55:07 I've seen @gordonramsay go to a restaurant he was trying to help, & scathingly throw out the truffle oil! Not agreeing or judging, just saying - I think you'll be hard pressed to find a chef (wot works as one) who will use truffle oil!

Anyone disagree?

What do you suppose a "donkey boiler" was, on an American whaler, circa the 1870s. It weighed two tons. Was it something, perhaps, for boiling down the whale flesh to oil?
Thank you.

8104 2018-08-13 06:25:26 i thought it was cute that my dog loves coconut oil (it's good for her) but now every time i put it on my face, she races over as soon as i open the jar 
8105 2018-08-13 06:25:02 I don't know if you'd have to stop your rx meds with it or not. my dog takes it in addition to his meds, and i know people do to with the cbd oil.

8133 2018-08-13 06:17:21 Same same. Water and food are lifesavers.

The Americans Season 6 has a particularly extreme recommendation, btw - do a shot of pure olive oil before drinking. Apparently coats the stomach, prevents it from absorbing a lot of the alcohol.
8134 2018-08-13 06:17:20 Of all your previous responses, this one is the most outrageous. Developed countries are 'giving us' oil? Which countries are these? Why would rich countries shift themselves to high-cost energy? What would be the rationale for such as a ridiculous decision?

8142 2018-08-13 06:15:03 Vegetable #oils, including sunflower oil, contain a lot of omega-6 fatty acids. Omega-6s are pro-inflammatory, while omega-3s are anti-inflammatory. By using healthier oil options (e.g. olive) you wont have to worry about getting this balance right!
8143 2018-08-13 06:14:50 USA does not fortunately support "Kurdistan". Which most understand why - the Kurds want to take land from Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Iran. Especially land where there is oil. Always oil. No way any country will accept that.

8168 2018-08-13 06:09:19 Do American ppl oil their baby's skin BEFORE  bathing them orrrr?
8169 2018-08-13 06:09:08 It’s not about the price of oil or our consumption of it. It is about the Saudis settling the oil trades in US Dollars and only US Dollars. This maintains the power of the dollar by forcing consumers of Saudi oil to acquire and hold dollars.
8170 2018-08-13 06:09:07 @dpradhanbjp Sir. In these times of sliding rupee, can the Indian government proactively follow up with governments that can provide us oil with discount and shore up our reserves? Can we help airlines get fuel at a cheaper price @MoCA_GoI
8171 2018-08-13 06:09:06 I'd be interested in this.  Of course controlling the previous use of the fryer is critical.  A worst case test where it had been used to cook something like breaded chicken up to the point the oil would be normally be replaced would be most informative.

8202 2018-08-13 06:02:38 In part, the issue in Canada is that we don’t really need to import oil or gas. We do because, in part, the infrastructure needed to integrate energy from coast to coast isn’t in place. 

So making it a policy isn’t the issue. Making it possible is.

8214 2018-08-13 06:00:31 Good morning folks. Great day to be alive. HE came through again . 2 things I suggest you try today. (1) Oil pulling. (2) No matter what you read on here today, try to not feel targeted. Perspectives will always differ. Engage maturely.

8217 2018-08-13 06:00:12 Well the tariffs have zero to do with the cost of steak in the US & price of gas is a scam. The cost of a barrel of crude oil is $65.00 which is less than what it was under Clinton. Oil & Gas companies are recording record profits. Anyways Tariffs have zero to do with cost gas
8218 2018-08-13 06:00:10 Better alternatives? Lol. RE does not and cannot supply the energy demand. Let’s just keep buying oil from dictators and human rights abusers instead of using Canadian oil. Makes sense. Oil will be around for decades. Let’s prosper as a nation.

8240 2018-08-13 05:56:51 You're stuck with oil demand because of your stupid climate change denying. Build solar, wind and hydro energy and get rid of oil. Get fresh air as a bonus.

8249 2018-08-13 05:55:51 CBA have halved their lending to coal power stations, to just $0.2B, while increasing their lending to renewable energy by 33% to $3.7b. They’ve also pulled out of oil and gas. They just don’t seem to like lending to fossil fuel businesses any more.
8250 2018-08-13 05:55:37 Whatever they do, please make sure that Cookie Monster Sec Ross doesn’t get his hands in it, since he made his fortune on the recycling. He will double/triple recycling prices since these monuments are toxic! He’s the one that is toxic & his boss as snake oil.
8251 2018-08-13 05:55:31 Head of Shell in the North Sea insists oil & gas remains "very significant" despite a political shift towards greener energy. The Dutch company is celebrating its 50th anniversary of operating in the UK & produces about 10% of our domestic oil and gas.    @KKeaneBBC #bbcgms 0715
8252 2018-08-13 05:55:25 No. Please compair PV to biomass.  Mother nature does not need to use all available solar energy, so it only uses a tiny fraction, like 0.3 to 3%.  Obviously PV at 20~40% beats that.  Obviously oil is the ultimate biomass which only makes it all the more tragic to just burn it.

8272 2018-08-13 05:52:23 Or just listen to Eastern Canada and science and do some simple math on your own and leave the oil where it is.  Why bother when there are much better alternatives that can literally empower everyone at the hyper local level.  Technology changes, we don't use horses nor oil soon.

8347 2018-08-13 05:36:23 Canada is a net crude oil exporter. It only imports crude oil because it is cheaper for some refineries to get their supplies from non-Canadian sources (primarily the US). The eastern seaboard, Great Lakes area, and the west coast are the primary importers.
8348 2018-08-13 05:36:09 Oil prices dipped on Monday as rising trade tensions dented the outlook for fuel demand growth especially in Asia, although U.S. sanctions against Iran still pointed towards tighter supply.

8357 2018-08-13 05:32:54 Also I bitch out the cost of women’s groming products constantly, the pink tax is real, but fuck me if you bastards don’t pay through the nose for a tiny tiny about of sented oil.
8358 2018-08-13 05:32:46 There is nothing honorable or heroic about killing Iraqi children in the name of oil.
8359 2018-08-13 05:32:37 Peppermint Oil deters ants, flies and a lot of pests get it from Amazon 
8360 2018-08-13 05:32:33 ugh I guess I'll maybe oil my hair occasionally too,,,
8361 2018-08-13 05:32:32 No, but most don't sell empowerment and snake oil to screw over & steal from other women

Most DJs are also men... So there's that too...and we know how male ego gets when unchecked
8362 2018-08-13 05:31:55 That’s a great idea. Tell that to Eastern Canada and get them to buy Canadian oil.
8363 2018-08-13 05:31:43 I just wanna know what you’d eat.... avocados and coconut oil? O_O I’m not asking this in a hating way. I’d love to be PB again but I wanna do keto also
8364 2018-08-13 05:31:40 Once on track to being an eco-economic & eco-tech world leader, we are now, with Donald J Trump occupying our presidency, again sold into big oil/pharma/finance. Exactly whose deal are you supposedly the art of, Don?
8365 2018-08-13 05:31:25 Recommend breathing and lavender oil.
8366 2018-08-13 05:31:08 But water and oil don’t mix so how can it be a good combination lol 
8367 2018-08-13 05:31:04 Well they went to Afghanistan for several reasons, to put military presence in the region & to counter Iran, Russia influence in the region and most of all OIL.
8368 2018-08-13 05:31:03 Oil prices dipped on Monday as rising trade tensions dented the outlook for fuel demand growth especially in Asia, although U.S. sanctions against Iran still pointed towards tighter supply.
8369 2018-08-13 05:30:58 If they disrupt or threaten to disrupt the oil flow through that pipeline then it could be Turkeys "straits of hormuz" moment and it could spiral out of control very fast!

WHY ISN'T THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA TALKING ABOUT THIS? BECAUSE IT'S A BIG WIN FOR PRES TRUMP?
8373 2018-08-13 05:30:41 I swapped my dad my argon hair oil for his fancy beard oil - which is likely made with very similar ingredients - because he likes the sent and is convinced it works better. Anyway now my legs smell like spicy chai.  almost but not quite on Envy for Men levels.

8375 2018-08-13 05:30:32 well there's a difference between cannabis oil and cbd cannabidiol oil. I'm talking cbd oil, hemp oil. That's not illegal. Cannabis is depending on the state. You can order the hemp/cbd oil online. I get Pete's online through Hemp RX but all of the places are different.

8386 2018-08-13 05:28:53 Malaysia cuts Sept crude palm oil export tax to 0%. Duty was cut to 4.5 % in August. Gazetted price for Sept CPO will be RM2,213.73 per tonne, compared with RM2,284.26 in August.
8387 2018-08-13 05:28:50 Standard Oil was broken up not because it harmed customers, but because other companies wanted their best competitor destroyed so they could gain more market share without having to work so hard to compete themselves.
8388 2018-08-13 05:28:27 Once a species figures out how to play with fire and how to make weapons, they just keep go out at it and that paints out planets in outer space. It's each a center of each blob. They just do their thing and sometimes disconnect and merge into pieces. Like different oil in water.
8389 2018-08-13 05:28:25  It's an oil painting! I keep forgetting to mention the medium on everything I post...  So glad you like it, thank you, once more!!!

Kalamidad ngayon sa maraming lugar. Maano man lang hindi nyo ituloy ang oil price hike ngayong linggo. Di nyo naman yan ikamamatay. Kaunting malasakit naman.

8402 2018-08-13 05:25:42 Meh. It gets us oil and provides another fingerhold in a region that pretty much hates us.
8403 2018-08-13 05:25:37 ky isnt txting back??? also my room smells like argan oil and this new type of incense that bought (cant remember the name) n im lovin it

8405 2018-08-13 05:25:12 Then you weren’t given the right oil. You need something like wild orange, balance, Serenity.  dōTERRA oils really do work.
8406 2018-08-13 05:24:54 eggs is a good start!!! nim has a good rice recipe thats real easy thatll be a great start to some dishes too!!! most things u cut up throw in a pan with some type of oil and u go tf off and u get some noms. i can send u my lil cook book of recipes when im home!!

8409 2018-08-13 05:24:19 The only monopolies are government created. Standard Oil had most of the market for a while, while they were doing amazing things, dramatically lowering the cost of heat, light, industrial fuel for their customers. Before being broken up they were losing a lot of market share.

8418 2018-08-13 05:22:36 I know what the term means but I think a lot of non economic people (myself included) would really appreciate a discussion of when and whether efforts like this might work. Like the whole "independence from foreign oil" trope. Even if possible would it accomplish anything?

8425 2018-08-13 05:21:49 Can't unfortunately cite the study but, apparently according to research military expansionism is directly proportional to and fuelled by economic strength (as in oil prices), not vice versa. Is projection of power cause or consequence of possible decline?

8435 2018-08-13 05:20:27 War and Western weapons are expensive. Used to have a personal game predicting which one fall first, Turkey or Saudi Arabia. Some experts said yrs ago Saudi had 5 yrs left. But, according to that their money runs out in few yrs w/out new Sokotra oil reserves from Yemen.

8437 2018-08-13 05:19:54 .@ManusCranny Here’s our take: On their own the multiple sources of markets risks (weaker CNY, higher US rates, elevated oil, EM turmoil & geopolitics) aren’t big enough to take global markets down. Taken together, they create a pretty toxic environment. It ain’t looking pretty!
8438 2018-08-13 05:19:48 #Erdogan must fall before the #US could start any military action against #Iran. Otherwise #Turkey would jump into thenpower vacuum.

8454 2018-08-13 05:17:43 And Rachel Notley’s true colours come back out. Are you suggesting that we should keep buying oil from countries with poor human rights? Or that our oil isn’t ethical for those same reason? I’m definitely back to disliking you.

8461 2018-08-13 05:16:53 I am shocked to learn that the deer velvet snake oil pills for credulous oldies contained very little deer velvet. Incidentally they were heavily advertised on Newstalk ZB (which contains very little news but much talk) and linked to the ACT party (you see where I'm going here)
8462 2018-08-13 05:16:34 axel's so nice..! i just hope he doesn't trip over all that oil..;;
8463 2018-08-13 05:16:33 Only thing I’ll probably use coconut oil for in the future is to remove my makeup & maybe during a prepoo
8464 2018-08-13 05:16:03 A lot of the rhetoric in recent days (re: Saudi) comes from Conservatives who routinely campaign on the oil-as-patriotism platform. They are ideologically confused, not unusually.
8465 2018-08-13 05:15:42 Nah it's just too silly to argue like that..... You don't spend 1 trillion dollars on military every year to to get some oil which they already have from their natural resources and Saudi Arabia. 12 trillion dollars till now for some oil?. Too costly and just a crazy conspiracy
8466 2018-08-13 05:15:28 It's definitely worth exploring! But I think the problem with the OPEC cartel is that if you don't buy from one of them you can't buy from any of them. You'd probably have to be really careful how you buy your oil.  Also they have a bunch of terrorists.

8472 2018-08-13 05:14:49 Oil, at this price....is about the fair and just price for the utility it brings.  There is no reason to limit competition.  The important thing is to look at managing the best projects thoughtfully, and processing its uses to improve health and quality.  This isn't 1950. do well

8630 2018-08-13 04:44:55 My girl Frida is getting a brand new cage, a brand new hideout, lavender scented bedding and bi-weekly coconut oil massages. I’ll be damned if one of my babies gets sick again.

8634 2018-08-13 04:43:27 Once again my recommendation to you is try to use a little bit of coconut oil it'll actually soak up a lot of the bacteria that's what I do at least I've had acne issues since I was 13

8637 2018-08-13 04:43:05 If you were on a budget but also boogie, would you buy an Audi Q5 or a Lexus RX? Both “gently used.”
Experience with Lexus: low maintenance other than brakes, oil change and worse EPA rating.
Experience with Audi: sleek but costly post 100K, better tank and MPG.
8638 2018-08-13 04:43:03 OOOH I LOVE THEM. I love their foundation!! And I use their wake and bake oil (it smells heavenly) and the flour powder in yellow for me is sooooo bomb

8640 2018-08-13 04:42:58 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.

8642 2018-08-13 04:42:47 People who say “I don’t like him as a person, but I like his music” about 6ix9ine can literally go crawl into a fucking burning pit of oil, trash, and tar.
8643 2018-08-13 04:42:40 they have different kinds like mint and coconut oil ! 
8644 2018-08-13 04:42:39 I’m citing articles that show how much Tesla’s sales are dependent on direct government subsidies. I didn’t write the article. 
Musk is not a visionary. He is a snake oil salesman.
8645 2018-08-13 04:42:36 Peppermint and lavender oil is not the same. Do not get them mixed up and then touch sensitive areas, like your face.

8661 2018-08-13 04:40:05 I agree, we clearly need to get our oil to market and fast to take market share from the saudis and their unethical oil and substandard environmental processes. We should also give immediate approval to #Energyeast and our clean oil can be used for all of Canada other

The US is seeking to throttle Iran's oil supply to the world from 4% of daily output to as close to 0% as posible.

8666 2018-08-13 04:39:19 I get it: writing it down or drawing is helpful sometimes/for some people. But the things u see under that tag are truly unnecessary & extra as fuck. There's no way u need to use like 4 colors per title or drawing a heart using fucking oil on canvas. Just read & stop the nonsense

8678 2018-08-13 04:37:33 Castor oil is a good moisturizer for your lips and under your eyes and tree oil is hella bomb.. and a good salt scrub tbh using natural oils helps pull out impurities

8696 2018-08-13 04:33:54 Yes, but the ‘big bad Hindu’ India has no problem buying oil from Iran, and yet we do. This doesn’t fit the usual ummah Vs Hindus narrative that Pakistani army propagandists peddle.
8697 2018-08-13 04:33:52 If you know anything about geophysics you’d know that’s correct. I happen to be a petroleum engineer so it’s a safe bet I might be slightly more informed than you. And I can’t wait until we have an alternative to oil either. For real. Sorry for triggering you...

8721 2018-08-13 04:28:34 As I focused on being more optimal. Cigarettes and drinking naturally left my psyche. think of it as a chart/trade/business. Does this decision lead to gains or losses.

 I have a few reasons to drink. Still not worth it.

I drink a lot of coffee blended with coconut oil though..

8726 2018-08-13 04:28:06 Personally I think it's just another scam. They don't want a space force, they want another way to steal tax dollars. They'd steal all the money and put up some cardboard space ships to show for it. It's all snake oil, smoke and mirrors.

8734 2018-08-13 04:26:10 You are ignorant.  The SPR is not that big.  And, yes, we have increased production with fracking but we are still a net oil importer.  And regardless, we are impacted by the global market...it's a global fungible commodity.  Look it up.

My daughter's dog was stage 4 bone cancers. Specialist oh her on oil long enough to stabilize and strengthen her enough to survive and thrive. Another year now.
8784 2018-08-13 04:18:29 And that’s not what happened here... Turkish banks “laundered” Iranian oil, nothing more

8788 2018-08-13 04:17:44 Didn't the DNC just rule that they can accept campaign contributions from oil companies? Seems to me that Pelosi (and a lot of other democrats) are too conservative to be in the party, let alone be minority leader.

This is why voters turn out for the green party, people!
8789 2018-08-13 04:17:37 I accidentally put peppermint oil on my face instead of Tea Tree oil... So no my eyes are like low-key burning from the fumes lol 
8790 2018-08-13 04:17:34 I am saddened when droves of Hindus get up and pack for India. PPP, Making Diwali official, but set conditions for minorities to self exile.
8791 2018-08-13 04:17:19 When my brother got married and my now sister-in-law wanted a funfetti cake, we did a test of all the recipes we could find (then baked a lot). Doctored cake mix was the favorite. Add vanilla pudding mix, an extra egg, melted butter instead of oil, and milk instead of water.
8792 2018-08-13 04:17:18 I thought this was oil they were putting on her skin. So pretty

A tablespoon of: cod liver & or castor oil, a Friday Night Special for us then, Mum would line is up & hand it out saying ‘if it was good for me then good 4 u’ #BoomerMemories

8804 2018-08-13 04:15:23 facts u dont NEED that free oil bitch ur greedy
8805 2018-08-13 04:15:16 Stalin wasn't a communist. The first people he executed were the communist party founders. He was a goon, an authoritarian, a state capitalist that made millions selling Russian oil on the free market. 

It's a shame what the right has done to education in this country.
8806 2018-08-13 04:15:04 Facts. And if that’s too much that that shit to jiffy lube or whatever oil spot around u and have em put u up to date if u not sure

8810 2018-08-13 04:14:31 Lol tank would probably get a oil can hahaha
8811 2018-08-13 04:14:11 Switch up your routine! Coconut oil is great at sealing in moisture but if it’s not there to begin with you’re just creating a barrier over dry skin
8812 2018-08-13 04:14:07 Ask the girls of their generation.
8813 2018-08-13 04:14:03 It's okay, she's got hope. We'll teach her about getting your hands wet with water+oil so your pupusas don't look like dry land.

8820 2018-08-13 04:12:51 theres your answer then, luv lol. however, depending on the mileage of your car (80,000+) you might need a synthetic oil change rather a conventional one. the owners manual also specifies the type of oil change your vehicle requires.
8821 2018-08-13 04:12:43 oh my god you gridded it too I have so much respect I hate griDDING ARE YOU USING ACRYLIC OR OIL
8822 2018-08-13 04:12:43 They derserve it for voting for a snake oil salesmen. MAGA 
8823 2018-08-13 04:12:39 The same mfs that complain about a woman not knowing how to cook or wanting to clean up after they asses be the same ones that don’t know how to change an oil or a tire  fuck out my face
8824 2018-08-13 04:12:35 Is the Sun American? Do you know the energy in oil is from ancient sunlight? Cut out the middleman.

What point are jobs if those jobs lead to heatwaves in decades that kill billions of people? Ever experience 100+ F at night? Do you want your grandchildren to?

8835 2018-08-13 04:11:08 ...how does someone ‘accidently’ pour coke instead of oil into a car... 
8836 2018-08-13 04:10:56 Ok, 3 things: 
1) yeah, this is a thing. Mine cleared up when I backed way off dairy.
2) Peach & Lily anti-acne dots are AMAZING. They're made out of that colloidal stuff you put on blisters & they are like freaking sorcery
3) evening primrose oil totally helps heal them quickly
8837 2018-08-13 04:10:52 Lil bit of loose juice in me, or as the old heads call it..."monkey oil".

8841 2018-08-13 04:10:13 Eggplant is Sooo good dude. Dip it in some flour and fry it in a lil oil. you can even go one step further and put some garlic powder or some other spice that u like or have in your kitchen. If you try this let me know how it turned out ok? Thanks!!
8842 2018-08-13 04:10:06 coconut oil. witch hazel also does pretty well.
8843 2018-08-13 04:09:59 I refer to those days as, I  would have been better off reading from the phone book sermons. That aside, Whiskey is an essential oil, I believe.
8844 2018-08-13 04:09:59 Nonsense frankly. How will US save dollar by siding with Saud when not much future oil is needed? Theyll be  bankrupt in next 100 years anyway. China should be the real threat. Bank has already been opened to give loans in non dollars with other countries as partners.
8845 2018-08-13 04:09:51 This girl just uploaded herself cooking wings in a huge pot of coconut oil saying that’s all her man likes. I am befuddled.

8854 2018-08-13 04:08:52 because the oil buildup messes with engine performance. you should have a sticker in the windshield that says when/ the mileage your car is due for a change.

8860 2018-08-13 04:07:24 I am of the same mind frame as Frederick Douglas regarding Republicans. No matter how imperfect the GOP is, it's still vastly better than being ruled over by Progressive Liberal Democrats, aka SJW's. 

Yeah, but I still don't trust Republicans. Fat cats. Oil moguls.

8864 2018-08-13 04:06:42 #maga and @realDonaldTrump now that EU and UK is going to be blocking US sanctions what currency do you think they will use for oil transactions? How long before everyone uses EU for oil transactions? Morons don't think past their own nose.

8870 2018-08-13 04:05:20 Bibimguksu so easy and fast to make too! Just 3min to cook somen noodles & cool,  then add sesame oil, kimchi, thin strips of cucumber & carrots, salt, soy sauce, and chili flakes. That’s the way my friends mom taught me but so many other ways  to make it!

8881 2018-08-13 04:03:04 U r an oil painting.
8882 2018-08-13 04:02:49 Also in Indian context , specifically Indian consumer goods story that stands out is emami in it's earlier days, selecting niche categories like cooling hair oil where the MNC Giants won't look into as it's too small but big enough for them, add to that using television ads
8883 2018-08-13 04:02:23 As a teen I "fried" fish we caught. It took 3 hours to descale (used a fork. Scales EVERYWHERE). Peeled off ALL the skin. Did NOT debone. Did NOT bread. Oil was too hot. Final product was what I now lovingly refer to as scrambled fish. And it was burnt  #WorstCooks

8884 2018-08-13 04:02:04 The endangered species might stop companies from getting oil, bc it happens to be where THEY live - no matter THEY were here FIRST!!!  And, of course, companies can't make MONEY from mere animals!!!!
8885 2018-08-13 04:02:01 shoutout to the time i told my husband “i gotta go to target, i need some hair oil” and he was like “??? WHAT” and i was like “... what” 

anyway, he thought i said heroin and then we both had a good laugh
8886 2018-08-13 04:01:49 If our provincial gov't, after witnessing this kind of grief, doesn't act to prevent this kind of thing from ever happening again, we are lost. The solution is simple, less. Less oil, less fishing, less hubris.
8887 2018-08-13 04:01:49 The wise man knows that its actually Castor oil, because he has no personality.
8888 2018-08-13 04:01:22 BTW, we are all gonna get hit because reimposing sanctions may take one million barrels per day of oil off the market. That's gonna raise gasoline prices in the USA. Oil is fungible worldwide market.

8895 2018-08-13 04:00:26 There are various light and heavy grade oils and refinery conditions. Alberta and Saskatchewan ship us what they can by rail, it would be safer to have a pipeline. The biggest exporter of oil to the East (Montreal and NB) is the USA. (Next question you think we don't understand?)

8914 2018-08-13 03:56:24 When I think about all the Republicans that have all these connections to Haliburton and other oil companies, I really have no confidence in a #RedWave. More fat cats that want to send out youth to their deaths in the Middle East under the guise they're protecting Zionists.
8915 2018-08-13 03:56:09 Just noticed that the olive oil I bought from @wegmans on Saturday had a "best by" date on 12/2017! They must not sell much of it for them not to notice such an out of date stock. Back to the store I go sometime this week. Ugh.

8924 2018-08-13 03:53:49 Then u will freeze in the winter, NO AC in the summer, no food. no transportation and no products to buy , which helps cause no jobs.
that is surviving without using oil

8931 2018-08-13 03:52:47 失くしたRITTO×OLIVE OILのアルバム、メルカリでゲット。購入して10分で発送してくれてマジ神対応やわ。良い人と巡り会えた。
8932 2018-08-13 03:52:46 how are you going to offset exchange rates in oil? Everyone else will be smooth sailing buying Arab oil with dollars, and China is too superior to be stuck on either of you or Russia. The American consumer is your enemy and why the world will stick with US. We're more fun, LOL!
8933 2018-08-13 03:52:44 I put tea tree oil in errting

8937 2018-08-13 03:51:57 Dumps oil all over the fish
8938 2018-08-13 03:51:48 No I don’t agree! Healthy fats are good for you. Now I’d say it’s best to eat grass fed butter & virgin cold pressed coconut oil over refined & corn fed. I’m pretty much done listening to what the AHA says; as w/most doctors they are clueless when it comes to nutrition!
8939 2018-08-13 03:51:45 Protection and promotion of the product, that much more important. 
Bust times and low oil prices hit Alberta hard.
The heritage fund? Where did that go?
All I'm suggesting is that this NDP govt is frankly a fluke and cannot happen again.
8940 2018-08-13 03:51:39 My take: 1) USD strength 1a) USD short end/cash is worth something now. 2) EM outflows/liquidity, 2a) Liquidity at large, it's been drying up in EM all year, and seasonally, the tinder is always dry in August.  2c) unlike 2015-6, EM weakness amid high(ish) oil prices.
8941 2018-08-13 03:51:22 Mera ek dost hai uske khet me excavation chal raha tha aur zameen me se crude oil nikla, bhai ne wo oil ek dabbe me bharke apni hyudai i20 ki fuel tank me daal diya, fir car start karne ki koshish ki To engine seize ho gaya, wo hyundai ke service station gaya car ko to unho ne...

8959 2018-08-13 03:49:19 A project this size requires global input and global investment. A transition to sustainable energy isn’t the job of one company, or one country. 

Regardless of regime this project must happen. China gets it. The soon to be oil starved Saudi’s get it.

And most of us do too.

8967 2018-08-13 03:48:07 Indeed I do understand govt debt. And I don't think that Albertans suffered to the extent that is made out.
Not one province could boast that- and in an economy in the 90's Ralphs fiscal management and oil /gas prices made Alberta the envy of Canada.
Making the management ,

8986 2018-08-13 03:45:33 You mean like screwing up No Korea JOKE. Allowing POISEN chemicals back on our food and in water. Coal sludge in water. Trying to sell our National Land for oil. Taking land from Indians. Was going to take bald eagle off endangered list. Got rid of EPA. Hired his gangster friends

8988 2018-08-13 03:45:31 Ideals our politicians follow are petty parody of greed for money & power. Nothing much, nothing less. Evident they are feeding on ignorance of uneducated & poor.

Mustard oil is very good in weight loss.
9004 2018-08-13 03:42:40 Northern Watersnake (Nerodia Sipedon). Non-venomous. Harmless unless you're a fish or frog, but will try to bite if you handle it. You can loosen it from that trap with vegetable oil. Try not to get it in his eyes.
9005 2018-08-13 03:42:25 When people ask me how I could go 100% whole food, plant based, no salt, sugar or oil and deprive myself I just tell them (1) I don’t feel the least bit deprived and (2) learning all these new dishes is a great new adventure.
9006 2018-08-13 03:41:57 Trump is literally a snake oil salesman. Boosting insurance company profits over the health and welfare of Americans. Shameful.

9039 2018-08-13 03:37:55 Here's the trick - the people that advertise they smoke it all the time are the problem, not people that just smoke it and don't make a big deal about it. Even my mom uses CBD oil these days.

9086 2018-08-13 03:30:50 Hey all, remember, don't use Lavender oil on boys prior to age 10. But once they hit puberty they can use it and it's great for pimples. My grandson said, "Grams that stuff works really fast!" We tried it yesterday on his first zit and 8 hours later it was almost gone.

9093 2018-08-13 03:29:55 Have you tried essential oils? If you hold a bottle of either lavender or peppermint oil right below your nose or put it on your temples it helps me a lot. Also a heating pad on the head and taking a nap
9094 2018-08-13 03:29:37 I'm JUST SAYING

9095 2018-08-13 03:28:54 In the 1850s CO2 was 0.028%. Then we started burning coal, oil, wood ...... I'm sure you get the picture. During the last 800,000 years, CO2 fluctuated between about 0.018% during ice ages and 0.028% during interglacial warm periods. Only a fool doesn't see what's happening.

9102 2018-08-13 03:27:02 Is this tea or diffuser oil?
9103 2018-08-13 03:26:52 Well, so far so good. We aren’t left with questions unanswered except for ‘What happened to Daniel? What happened to the oil guys?’ Let’s see where this ride takes us. Thankfully we didn’t jump ahead 2-3 years (terrible idea).
9104 2018-08-13 03:26:02 Oh, and... if the recipe calls for milk or cream, replace with coconut milk/cream, usually with little to no loss. Replace butter with oil of choice (peanut/sesame). Thicken with coconut flakes or sesame paste (tahini). You can live a healthy life as undercover/part-time vegan.

9106 2018-08-13 03:26:00 I never thought I would be obessed with essential oils... But now I am like sick use an oil, headache there is an oil, stress smell an oil, and acne use an oil. Best decision I have ever made!

9108 2018-08-13 03:25:40 Un camion gasta 40 lts. Para hacer 100 km. Si el gas oil cuesta $ 30 x litro, de combustible solo precisamos $ 1.200 cada 100 km.
Eso se traslada directamente a los alimentos. No es muy dificil@comprenderlo. Mas peajes, mas seguros, mas impuestos....FORTUNAS!!!

9110 2018-08-13 03:25:28 So I just flushed a bunch of fish oil pills down the toilet, that's okay right?  It won't make the sewer fish too strong right?
9111 2018-08-13 03:25:13 Put peppermint oil on my temples to get rid of my headache and totally got some in my eye... at least I’m not worried about the headache anymore. 
9112 2018-08-13 03:25:13 Oh and tea tree oil
9113 2018-08-13 03:25:05 1,  It sounds impressive.
2.  It will obviously require a lot of time to create.
3.  It will probably require a lot of money that the average citizen can't track.
4.  His other big promises have fallen flat.
5.  He's almost out of snake oil to sell.
9114 2018-08-13 03:25:00 They're just clearing the area for the @GOP donors can get in there to drill for oil
9115 2018-08-13 03:24:57 UK will have a big shift on domestic oil supply in the next 2 years. Huge basins being drilled as we speak that would easily supply us. Must be ways for other countries to tweak things.

9126 2018-08-13 03:23:44 I’m not an oil person but I can see how lavender would help with sleep, and how peppermint perks you up a little but these people saying it’ll cure panic disorders or cancer are so wild.

9133 2018-08-13 03:22:57 at least sounds more involved than the white "olive oil salt and pepper" method. although from what i understand for some of us that is actually relatively advanced
9134 2018-08-13 03:22:22 FUDGE; grease bottom of pan with stick of butter; use melted butter instead of oil

9142 2018-08-13 03:20:54 Tonight my mom made me an essential oil bubble bath, gave me a stress relieving eye mask, and sent me in the bathroom where Hank was waiting for me with his favorite toy. No one let me go two months without seeing this angel again!!!
9143 2018-08-13 03:20:52 Whatever helps you make it to the next day, Rogue. What some fail to realize is that none of us want to take pills if other things worked. + I realize I mayb getting close to the final chapter. I do so w all peace. But no snake oil salesmen need come by.
9144 2018-08-13 03:20:35 Did you not see Tom Perez just propose the abolishing of the rule that forbade donations from big oil PACs. Also, how can I trust these dems when they've just jumped on the Medicare for all bandwagon??
9145 2018-08-13 03:20:21 V productive day. Woke up, took a shower, talked to my mother 4 different times, got 2 tats, made a tuna sammie, did some laundry, got an oil change, had a green juice, caught up on Trial & Error. V productive.

9164 2018-08-13 03:17:48 I think perhaps you're not paying attention.

9167 2018-08-13 03:16:59 Market days leave you with unsightly dry and irritated skin? Fatty face oils, such as marula and argan oil, help to heal popper burn to ensure your co-works won’t ask questions!

9177 2018-08-13 03:15:04 Fair enough. If it hasn't resealed, then try using a belt as a wrench like on an oil filter?
9178 2018-08-13 03:14:55 Biodegradable, I'm with you %.  We should go back to paper shopping bags too. Milk cartons. Use of plastics in just about everything has increased the cost of gas,oil, diesel etc. Which has increased the cost of living. Along with a plastic Island in the Pacific ocean.
9179 2018-08-13 03:14:49 At a certain point hopefully you realize (I did at least) that your belief that cars are superior and active transport is inferior is the result of generations of brainwashing by big oil & auto. The entire way we move in LA is one big auto/oil scheme. And it's time to break it.

9181 2018-08-13 03:14:25 Lame! Have you tried CBD oil? I don’t get them but a friend of mine swears the oil helps when she rubs on neck and temples with some peppermint.
9182 2018-08-13 03:14:22 Is the dems cared about the country they would push for an end to the 8 conflicts we are in right now. They would also push for Medicare for all and would cut all ties with big oil and gas companies but that is not what they are doing
9183 2018-08-13 03:14:13 Sanctions compared to what they’re losing from oil revenues are peanuts. If you want to help Russia, you go green like Obama and Hillary. Putin loved the regulations they put on coal and drilling. Made him a fortune.
9184 2018-08-13 03:13:43 Alexa what’s the best essential oil for getting rid of my bills
9185 2018-08-13 03:13:41 I can’t  this tweet. Potatoes with truffle salt or risotto with truffle oil... it’s like it’s so bad it’s good. It’s almost like a hormonal scent that tempts and repulses you at the same time.

9187 2018-08-13 03:13:35 So the thing is, we always knew the CPC is fucked up... Even the ones who pretended to be reasonable but sold their souls for oil money. The key is to see how much of a pass the media gives them. #cdnpoli

9191 2018-08-13 03:12:50 Yea this was just a survey because everywhere I wanted to eat a salad they only gave balsamic vin and olive oil! Every time. I loved it.
9192 2018-08-13 03:12:46 CHINA HAS REMOVED ITS 25% TARIFF ON OIL

WHY ISN'T THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA TALKING ABOUT THIS? BECAUSE IT'S A BIG WIN FOR PRES TRUMP?
9193 2018-08-13 03:12:44 Just earlier, I applied oil onto my sword so it has great sharpness. If you touch it even slightly, your fingers would be cut and blood could spill.
9194 2018-08-13 03:12:40 The oil work so good on Zoey
9195 2018-08-13 03:12:27 I just accidentally knocked the table with my foot and my entire cup of nighttime tea spilled (already upsetting) and drowned my oil  I’m sad
9196 2018-08-13 03:12:07 We know the hearts of most in the UK and we will take the 'stiff upper lip' on this one. The real harm is not to Canada but to KSA who will lose out on medical university education and, with their increased hostility, perhaps an oil customer as well.

9205 2018-08-13 03:10:48 Scalp oil massages feel so good 
9206 2018-08-13 03:10:44 I agree. It can't be that hard to fit low oil sensors.  I'm surprised that Toro doesn't have them for the 3555D mowers. I've been lucky.

9215 2018-08-13 03:09:56 Hahaha well for my skin type I use the acne defense facial wash and acne gel, but their tomato toner (lotsa people underestimate how toner really makes a difference!) 

Sunflower oil is what I use for moisturizer (sparingly) cuz it helps fade acne scars too
9216 2018-08-13 03:09:35 Steamed veggies only again, seeing if the mass amount of olive oil I cook my vegetables in has anything to due with my digestion issues. Will report back.
9217 2018-08-13 03:09:24 Well, good news, it's not oil, brake fluid, steering fluid, or transmission fluid; and probably not coolant or anti-freeze. It's probably just condensation. Dab your fingers in it and check to see if it has a smell. If not it is probably safe to taste test for sure.

9225 2018-08-13 03:07:29 Oh no doubt! It’s just where the money and top competition is. Teams are shelling out hundreds of millions of dollars per year to buy players AND paying top guys $300k+ a week in salary. It’s that Middle Eastern oil money talking. It’s beyond what we have here in any sport!

9243 2018-08-13 03:04:07 It should be ok - if I recall correctly we sometimes use another recipe that just calls for veg oil so it’s most likely ok!
9244 2018-08-13 03:04:06 Exactly. You can buy all the snake oil you won't but it doesn't garentee anything.

9289 2018-08-13 02:57:01 So CBD oil is fucking life changing and everyone who has even considered trying it should definitely DO IT!
9290 2018-08-13 02:57:01 I feel you.  As an Albertan I have benefitted from the oil industry.  As someone who loves our rivers, forests, oceans and wildlife as well as someone who supports our Indigenous communities and their rightful land claims; it  is difficult to support pipelines.

9333 2018-08-13 02:52:22 I'm not sure that I agree. There's no question that Canada's oil industry would benefit from less dependence on the American market, but refineries are complex operations that need to be free to make decisions as to where they are getting their oil.

9348 2018-08-13 02:49:37 Well, Mr Bob, the millions of Americans who are now breathing cleaner air and drinking cleaner sure are grateful that the EPA was created to modulate the inherent greed of the coal and oil oligarchs...And chemical polluters

9350 2018-08-13 02:49:24 5 steps to perfect salmon:

1. Preheat oven to 425°
2. Heat 2 tbsp olive oil in skillet on med-high
3. Sear filets for 2 min on each side
4. Transfer to oven and roast for 6 to 8 min
5. Listen to “Jammin” by Bob Marley but mentally replace each iteration of ‘jammin’ with ‘salmon’

9360 2018-08-13 02:47:20 I use the conditioner when I wash my hair (every 1.5-2 weeks) and oil once a week because it’s so heavy. I have a long scarf situation that I wrap my hair up in, hopefully that works 
9361 2018-08-13 02:47:12 Nope. Honest truth. Well technically it's $700 for an oil change and system check. Of course, they'll find something that it needs like new brakes or it'll be leaking or something. In the end, your bill is always $2500+ This is after warranty of course

9378 2018-08-13 02:44:53 oops, just dropped oil on my shirt
9379 2018-08-13 02:44:47 Yep! And it keeps forever, pour out any extra into a coffee can or some such and keep it in your fridge

My favourite thing to do with bacon fat is to roll Brussels sprouts in it (and salt) then roast 'em, but it's a good choice for pretty much any cooking that needs fat or oil

9417 2018-08-13 02:40:04 Why doesn’t Canada immediately prohibit the importing of Saudi Oil or at least announce a timeline to phase it out?  We have the third largest reserves and should never be dependent for energy on countries that we can’t count on to be dependable commercial partners.

9425 2018-08-13 02:38:58 Just FYI, most of the oil that leaves #ymm is already upgraded to a easily refinable oil that any refinery can use. It's actually better then the oil coming out of the ground, that's why it's usually sold at a premium price because of better yields.

9436 2018-08-13 02:37:58 I very much doubt that, considering how that would take away from funding to blow up other countries for oil.

9447 2018-08-13 02:36:47 which in turn has allowed us to weaponize the global payments network and impose sanctions more damaging than missile strikes.  In return for only accepting dollars for their oil, we have guaranteed the security of the Saudi gvt. And so we turn a blind eye to their brutality.

9449 2018-08-13 02:36:26 The problem is type of oil, + geography. Eastern refineries can't refine Alberta crude. Train shipping too dangerous anyway. And special pipelines would be needed. It IS complicated. But the Saudis are not complete fools. They still be selling oil. They did Canada a favour.

9468 2018-08-13 02:33:46 Let’s get one thing straight ya little shit. Being promoted to manager with your oil field company doesn’t make you an entrepreneur. Busting ass day in and day out, building from the ground up, and willing to eat shit sandwiches for success, that’s what makes you an entrepreneur.
9469 2018-08-13 02:33:18 Hard to say exactly, but the petro dollar argument makes sense.  By only accepting payment in dollars for their oil, the Saudi gvt is putting upward pressure on the value of the u.s. dollar.  This has helped maintain the dollar as the world's reserve currency ...

9479 2018-08-13 02:32:14 Just to recap: Saudi Arabia is not Canada’s friend or ally. It never has been. The Saudis are strategic competitors to Canada & it’s oil industry. The Saudi regime deliberately tried to cripple Canada’s energy industry, throwing hardworking Canadians out of work.

9484 2018-08-13 02:31:38 How about subsidies on the various food and medicines? Is gst the real culprit in those excessive price increase? If yes, why hasn't these items pricing being reduced significantly? Eg. Cooking oil.
9485 2018-08-13 02:31:21 And what does tea tree oil do?
9486 2018-08-13 02:31:20 Just a reminder: "We" don't decide where refineries source their oil. They do.
9487 2018-08-13 02:31:14 @novantheodorus Hello Novan,will you use new airbag for your ship launching?We are the manufacturer of item, also have cooperated with Indonesia Oil Giant-Petermina :)Hope to hear from you soon..
9488 2018-08-13 02:31:13 Yeah how about when Bush killed for all that oil!
9489 2018-08-13 02:31:10 It’s interesting.  I was told today that Solar power was too expensive, but the good news is there is oil and gas on other planets!  This actually happened.  
9490 2018-08-13 02:31:04 Hey Ballers! Shutdown period Aug 13-17. We can’t talk/text, but we’ll be thinking of you! School is starting! 
1) set some new goals for this YR
2) get a diffuser w/ tee tree oil for your room
3) get a rad new backpack (yes, I said rad in a tweet )
To be continued! Whoot whoot!
9491 2018-08-13 02:30:46 I don't think Iran will closes the Hormuz Straight if US won’t allow Iran to export Oil. I expect closer collaboration, collusion between Russia, China and Iran to respond to, circumvent US sanctions, tariffs. EU could join in in some way.
9492 2018-08-13 02:30:40 If you ever feel like no one interacts with you on Twitter, just type "CBD" and "oil".

9499 2018-08-13 02:29:31 Oh my glob, my kid tried to die every 2 years for 8 yrs. As a toddler he climbed a baby fence and pulled a pot of ALMOST cool oil down on his HEAD while I was bringing in groceries from the hall. I hurdled a gate, knee slid in the oil, hit my feet and was in the shower in 1 move
9500 2018-08-13 02:29:22 Please....explain to me why Saudi Arabia is important to us Canadians?  Oil?  Pfft we will just get it from somewhere else...what else you got that we want?  Fuck all of nothing....

9503 2018-08-13 02:29:00 After they’re cooked do you do back to back add-ins or whatever you call it.. Like the olive oil, salt, pepper and then after that do the hot sauce?
9504 2018-08-13 02:28:54 Gotta go get a oil change before I go to work tomorrow 
9505 2018-08-13 02:28:53 Due to the high cost of oil sands production, the Saudi plan to depress oil prices damaged  Canada's energy sector.
9506 2018-08-13 02:28:42 Money? Oil?
You tell me, why is any war good or needed.
9507 2018-08-13 02:28:37 I say build that pipeline in Canada with Cdn standards. Oil will continue to be pumped in Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, etc. Are we ok with spills elsewhere? Here, we can control the quality and safety. Otherwise we abdicate responsibility.
9508 2018-08-13 02:28:35 They didn't die for oil.
9509 2018-08-13 02:28:34 I gotta get that oil leak fixed ASAP

9515 2018-08-13 02:28:03 The oil glut caused by Saudi overproduction caused a steep drop in oil prices, forcing many shale oil & some oil sands projects to scale back operations or shut down. Now that the competition has been reduced, price per barrel is predicted to hit $100 per barrel soon.

9517 2018-08-13 02:27:50 Lmao & STILL have to smoke cause then you’re just blown 
haha definitely! i can’t really bake for shit but I’m tedious about the oil making 
9518 2018-08-13 02:27:46 The last statement from the reporter was kind of flipped around. Trump just slapped Russia with more sanctions! Also, by helping American oil companies produce more, Trump is boosting American oil output in competition with Russia/Middle East, etc.

9528 2018-08-13 02:26:19 Y’all don’t have a special oil for your vagina? Is it just me?
9529 2018-08-13 02:25:59 Back in 2014, the Saudi strategy was clear: pump excess oil to drastically lower the price of oil to force shale oil & oil sands producers out of business.
9530 2018-08-13 02:25:52 Youuuuss a real friend ! Lol  I need a oil change now tbh 
9531 2018-08-13 02:25:51 tea tree oil
9532 2018-08-13 02:25:48 I never once said they announced plans. I said you over simplify and mislead when you suggest that means they weren't looking at it and wouldn't have. 

As your article confirms, Irving was looking at it. So were the others.   Why wouldn't they Cdn oil is cheaper.

9539 2018-08-13 02:25:21 In this instance, it is not clear to me what has been agreed, all seems rather vague, and the discussion of many issues (such as oil and gas reserves) have actually been postponed.

9553 2018-08-13 02:22:48 You’re referencing a situation where someone was said to smell like oil & weed by another person in the same room & a clothing line being talked highly upon when it had nothing to do with the models hair. Next

9556 2018-08-13 02:21:47 A better question would be why are we still buying Saudi oil?

9577 2018-08-13 02:18:08 Hardly any Saudi oil imported to either US or Canada. Their power is financial clout and ability to affect price of crude. Can’t do anything about that.

9581 2018-08-13 02:17:14 The only way your suppositions would have merit is if everyone owned their own business. I can do that by buying my own trk and being an owner operator. But then I'd have to buy fuel from capitalist oil companies to move the tri, insurance from capitalist insurance companies, pay

9614 2018-08-13 02:11:50 It says nothing of the sort! The Irvings never made any plans or commitments to make the investments necessary to process oil sands crude. The only thing they DID commit to was continuing to use Saudi crude...which is the sole reason this issue is in the news this week.

9617 2018-08-13 02:11:25 I know what you mean, but the problem with our region is the the timing is never right & policymakers unfortunately tend to postpone initiatives for many decades in many cases; I'm think of diversification strategies every time oil prices collapse, but which are never realized..
9618 2018-08-13 02:11:24 @OilsandsAction It's time Canada cut their tie with opec and start developing our own oil industry. If we take charge, we can control the environmental impact and benefit from it. We have the people, the knowledge and the mean to do it. #Canadafirst

9621 2018-08-13 02:11:09 Russia was not for Trump, they were Clinton. Clinton would have pushed against fracking, would not have said anything about Europeans buying Russian oil and gas, she would not have demanded Europe spend more on NATO. She would have been the true pawn of Russia.

9633 2018-08-13 02:09:48 My draconic bloodline sorcerer was "convinced" to trade her Cloak of Protection for an Alchemy Jug. Now one of her favorite tricks is to throw a clay pot of oil from the jug, then Quicken Spell cast firebolt for that good, ongoing fire damage each turn.
9634 2018-08-13 02:09:47 Why a lot of people out here look like they have a oil burner in they glove compartment
9635 2018-08-13 02:09:45 How is the military industrial complex a failure? We have only been at war for a couple decades. Isn't constant warfare a success? Sucking oil from the teat of opec while selling arms to the Saudis isn't a win?
9636 2018-08-13 02:09:22 Literally nothing but genetics and coconut oil
9637 2018-08-13 02:09:12 I'm getting my oil changed this week too in preparation. Like I'm so fuckinf ready to get home. I've missed my friends so much
9638 2018-08-13 02:09:10 I’m telling y’all, if you have sensitive gums gargle coconut oil for about 5-10 minuets a day and you will see the difference!
9639 2018-08-13 02:09:04 Ummm NO 
Example A: *Zendaya wears dreads* gets mocked on a nationwide television show and the person says she smells like patchouly oil and weed 
Example B: *Marc Jacobs uses white models with dreads in his show* it gets called high fashion and a trendsetter.
9640 2018-08-13 02:09:01 #DYK that there are more than 338,000 K-12 students in New Mexico? Their future is why it’s so important that we protect the education funding provided by the oil and gas industry.
9641 2018-08-13 02:08:47 Aye definitely, the dude who brought climate change to the forefront of public consciousness, and the harm fossil fuels cause is in the pocket of the Russian government, a state that relies heavily on oil rents.
9642 2018-08-13 02:08:46 IG Farben, Standard Oil, etc.. were "international" City of London and Wall St. corps like Ford or any of the others financing Hitler/Stalin and the rest. Train loads of freedom lovers off to labour camps... same "new" deal everywhere.
9643 2018-08-13 02:08:42 use olive oil and coconut oil and a hot wash cloth if you need them to come off! it got mine out quick and didn’t rip any of my real lashes out
9644 2018-08-13 02:08:26 @dannymcginlay - Armageddon, Directors commentary is ELITE!! At one point Ben Affleck says, “I have no idea why it would be easier to train oil drillers to become astronauts, instead of training astronauts how to drill” - Fantastic point
9645 2018-08-13 02:08:16 If someone "mislead you" into eating brownies laced with marijuana without your knowledge and you test pos on a drug test are you guilty of smoking marijuana?

9661 2018-08-13 02:06:18 Saudi Arabia and Russia are leading the agreement by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  and other producers to curtail oil supplies and end a three-year  surplus. Under the accord reached in December, Saudi Arabia pledged to  cap its output at 10.058 million a day

9663 2018-08-13 02:05:45 Any oils or moisturizers with anti-aging components! I’m on a Mary Kay regimen lol, but I do know that anything with Tea Tree, Peppermint or Coconut oil really helps.

They're like leprechauns. Rare, they got valuable items, and if you miss em, you gotta wait a while before seeing another one.
9667 2018-08-13 02:05:15 @ChickfilA when are you going to stop using peanut oil? If you do I’ll be a customer again
9668 2018-08-13 02:05:07 It made me cry first time I went down 2 Gulf Shores.  Pelicans, cranes, fish. Oil spill plus over load of chemicals into water. Depending on flow of current, we had horrible sludge on our sparkling sand. First tropical storms that came inland smelled strange
9669 2018-08-13 02:05:06 coconut oil will do

9673 2018-08-13 02:03:59 The most dangerous part of Castor Oil Plant are the hull (outer covering) on its seed. Since the hull contains Ricin or poison.

So no hull = safe. IMO commercialized Castor Oil are safe, since you know they dont want their customer to die.
9674 2018-08-13 02:03:44 Trump sanctions against Iran have resulted in major oil deposits falling into Chinese hands while U.S. fracking operations may be on the decline.Sanctions and tariffs are useless without a strategy for their application.For now the pain is greater for us than for others.

9682 2018-08-13 02:02:48 The best thing about coconut oil is it's non GMO!
9683 2018-08-13 02:02:44 Really? Did you actually read that? It said he admitted to being misled into taking what he thought was flex seed oil and arthritis cream, which his trainer 6 to 9 years later claimed was steroids.
9684 2018-08-13 02:02:34 I had one colonoscopy using mineral oil. Tasteless. And it gets the job done.
9685 2018-08-13 02:02:18 Mis-labelling people you fear & questioning patriotism are simply diversionary tactics. A growing number of people can now see the snake oil you're peddling, Andrea. That's why we need a #PeoplesVote now.

9688 2018-08-13 02:01:37 Those can be really expensive. Have lots of attachments. Different parts for oil, and different parts for dry herb. You just need a straight dry weed vape pen.

9693 2018-08-13 02:00:58 And what do grads need? It is not the same for all. If you are going to work in an oil field you need a different skill set than a brain surgeon or a translator for the UN or a used car salesman. But all of us should know some things. That is the basis of things like common core.

1. If I don’t have butter I’m sure as hell not gonna have coconut oil
2. There’s more saturated fat in coconut oil than butter
9700 2018-08-13 02:00:15 This place was heavenly. We bought lavender springs, honey, tea and oil.

9702 2018-08-13 02:00:07 Getting our oil to world markets will mean an additional 15 billion a year into our coffers. But just to be fair what was our return on investment on the billions of $ of  bailouts for bombardier and the auto sector?
9703 2018-08-13 01:59:59 ありがとうございます
9704 2018-08-13 01:59:51 ¼ cup avocado oil, ¼ tsp salt, ¼ tsp mustard or mustard seed, 1 egg, all in food processor.

Slowly add* 1 cup more avo oil while blending.

Mix in 1 or 2 tsp lemon juice or white vinegar (tastier).

* The little food pusher on ours holds exactly 1 cup liquid & has a tiny hole.

9708 2018-08-13 01:58:42 It seem like new things come up each time.
How about do an experiment?
Make till a certain date to eat animal products & check the results.
Then the next day for 2 months include more avocado, nuts, spinach, coconut oil in your diet, see the results, if there is any difference?
9709 2018-08-13 01:58:38 That reminds me @ForkReporter is it better to cook with @StarKistCharlie's canned Orca in Water or Orca in Vegetable Oil? I'm making orca salad on rye.

9711 2018-08-13 01:58:16 Know what?  You seem to be underscoring the point I’m making about Ontario but haven’t provided any specific data.  What I found out just now is that before oil tanked in 2013, Ont had nearly 5x as many min wage earners as AB.
9712 2018-08-13 01:58:09 Idc, a full tank, clean car, and an oil change makes your car drive like brand new
9713 2018-08-13 01:58:07 Oh and one more note on the Saudi thing:

Canada has absolutely 0 interest in invading anybody and/or trying to control their oil reserves. (I don't need to name fair-weather imperialist and/or former imperialist mutual friends)
9714 2018-08-13 01:57:54 As senior drilling advisor will conrinue to tweet about oil & gas and for the business oriented companies or individuals can join me for further discussion, if there is interest in this area
9715 2018-08-13 01:57:50 Infact, there is no real economy in Iran .
Only Oil revenues controlled and spent by the revolutionary guard and the Ayatullahs
9716 2018-08-13 01:57:50 That's like saying all military personnel are agents of capitalist interest because they fought in Iraq. Do you really think the young men and women who were deployed in GW2 had any interest in the oil industry? You're confusing those in power with those who work for them.
9717 2018-08-13 01:57:30 I read the comments here and there are too many ignorants. War is made by money not by peace. Oil or gas is something of really important of the US economy. There are no heroes but just killers who kill innocents people for the business of multinationals.
9718 2018-08-13 01:56:42 お仕事マンか、仲間じゃんね
9719 2018-08-13 01:56:40 The entire world economy is based on wether or not they sell their oil in US dollars.
9720 2018-08-13 01:56:26 Your own youth council is saying fuck the pipeline. Yet you still take sides with giant foreign oil corporations over your own Canadians. It's embarrassing to call you our PM, I trusted you, I took your word that you would be a great climate leader. Lies and deception.

9729 2018-08-13 01:54:43 I wrote few tweets about the oil and gas industry; what are the major oil companies planning how to proceed from here taking in consideration the new developments in Texas producing from the prolific oil reservoir in the Permian basin using new technology; more about this later
9730 2018-08-13 01:54:27 Y’all ever thought about cooking oil free?
9731 2018-08-13 01:54:18 You don't seem to know the mechanisms well enough to understand what's true or false (veggie oil! ).

Go understand what the mechanism of rimonabant is, then let's talk. 
9732 2018-08-13 01:54:14 I dice the chicken in like 1inch cubes and add whatever veggies I have (broccoli, zucchini, squash, potatoes are all my usuals) toss them in olive oil and my seasoning of choice and then bake at 425° for 15-20 minute. I mix it about halfway through.
9733 2018-08-13 01:54:09 Good point. Please ask your right-wing American friends. Btw, did u not just tweet global warming disinfo from Prager U? Perhaps you just want oil from "good" countries? As for your question, I think the answer is cheap gas and plastic. It has been our answer for about 75 years.
9734 2018-08-13 01:54:00 Yes; yes he will squander it and alienate Alberta and Saskatchewan while doing so.  My suggestion: tell Saudi Arabia to keep their oil, build energy east and use clean, ethically produced Canadian product....won’t happen.
9735 2018-08-13 01:53:57 Ok so I started using the CBD oil hasn’t changed much yet but I’m not one to give up so keep on pushing I tell myself
9736 2018-08-13 01:53:39 Naturals be doing too much to their hair. You can't moisturize your hair with oil, nor does it seal in moisture. YouTube will lead you astray for sure.
9737 2018-08-13 01:53:32 But in small towns like where I live. The oil field is a main source of job search. And most of the companies have closed. Hard to find decent paying jobs that aren't fast food

9741 2018-08-13 01:53:09 So Keith Ellison abused his girlfriend and Tom Perez is covered in an oozy layer of oil. I'm glad we had such a long and contentious battle for DNC Chair. It worked out so well.

9752 2018-08-13 01:50:46 The really exciting thing is POTUS reformed Saudi Arabia. The Crown Prince Salmon invited Christians to build churches in SA. And women driving, 1st movie house in 38 yrs. God's timing, (SA oil going dry) Trump saved them from a coup d'etat, offered business deals to save them.
9753 2018-08-13 01:50:44 If you believe it then it must be true. It saddens me to see wrong-headed protesters trying to shut down a viable industry. The only result will be lost jobs in an economy that's starting to flounder. Just suppose that the world stopped using oil tonight. Imagine the benefits.

9771 2018-08-13 01:49:09 true.  but heart disease is usually attributed to clog arteries mostly from eating fatty foods.  in the old days, people used lard in everything.  i believe that the europeans lived long lives because of the olive oil and fish diets. #60minutes

9782 2018-08-13 01:47:14 Sure. But whatever you pick, China and Japan don’t square with “government guidelines said eat carbs” as best explanation of obesity. It is compelling but false (veggie oil!) and I wish people would back away from it.

9853 2018-08-13 01:37:05 It’s more cost effective to be rid of Al Saud , oil is weapon . The west will never relinquish control of it nor should we . To think otherwise is naïveté it self .
9854 2018-08-13 01:36:57 I agree with stopping subsidies but if you bought anything at a store today it was probably delivered by truck and they cant fly planes on solar or rubber bands. We're stuck with oil for a while yet so let's use it as sensibly as possible until the alternatives can take over.

9889 2018-08-13 01:31:59 The cost of gas varies on states and counties, areas closer to known petroleum and oil facilities will have cheaper gas as it’s easy to acquire and sell in large quantities, however during the flooding in Houston, gas prices rose due to oil facilities being closed

9908 2018-08-13 01:28:46 everyone in ahonens ninth period class would join me on fridays to clean our faces with my oil blotting sheets and wow i really miss those days and those people so freaking much
9909 2018-08-13 01:28:45 Loyal to what? What is this force you think I should be loyal to above God? America’s Millitary complex? I am willing to die, not fighting in a war for Oil and Israel however. I don’t care what their views are these are my views
9910 2018-08-13 01:27:55 I think that psychic intruders might be trying to start an earthquake to damage the underground oil pipe.

9912 2018-08-13 01:27:12 I certainly don't think we should apologize. But I think we should wait for Saudi to cut off the oil to Canada. Cuz they want us to and I don't want to give them anything.

9914 2018-08-13 01:27:06 It costs $21k to change the oil in a Bugatti, and takes 27 hours to do. Waste of a car..

9920 2018-08-13 01:26:21 I hate ppl losing money, but JUNK is JUNK. $sx A snake CEO, w/ snake promoters, selling snake oil. Not sure how anyone expected anything else? Its too bad, ppl left life changing money on the table and its GONE!
9921 2018-08-13 01:26:18 IMO the story no one is asking but should be is “How did $13B in gold clear/settle 8x more Iranian (oil) trade given USD sanctions?”

Take gold prices up 8x globally and the “risk free asset shortage” would be majorly reduced if not all but over...

9923 2018-08-13 01:26:00 O my god kids don’t like mayo, I get it. Your article is solid evidence in the case against being paid by the word. In the entire screed, though, you overlook any logical argument to be had for consuming egg yolks suspended in oil as a healthy approach to living.
9924 2018-08-13 01:25:43 @Ocasio2018 another one of your socialist comrades failed. Americans understand that socialism always fails. Socialist Venezuela is a disaster despite huge oil reserves.

9926 2018-08-13 01:25:22 I've seen several names on the signers list who are still taking oil money. Where is the accountability? This is literally just a list of signers that can still do what they want and will do just that.
9927 2018-08-13 01:25:15 Natural beauty tip: use coconut oil + water on a cotton pad to remove your makeup. 

Takes makeup off really easily + doesn’t have any harsh chemicals. 

My rosacea is practically gone since I started using coconut oil + my face is softer than a baby’s ass 
9928 2018-08-13 01:25:15 Who runs crypto?
Crypto has to be denominated in something.
Oil is a tremendous amount of money, first question is still here
who'd cover the vig.
Diplomatic hogwash aside Russia has too small an economy, they'd be eaten. Forget the smiles and handshakes they are mortal foes.
9929 2018-08-13 01:25:07 I can lol - the Oil was coming anyway it could not be stopped . By rail, tanker or pipeline. None were good options - she thought the pipeline was better than the other two.

9933 2018-08-13 01:24:33 ye claim that president donald "trump" (drumpf) is a man, but have ye gazed upon his flesh? his flesh bears more resemblance to cakes made of corn dough and cow's cheese cooked in hot oil than it does to the flesh of a man

9935 2018-08-13 01:23:36 Sure this makes as much sense as selling our oil at a discount to WTI  Others get rich while we lose BILLONS of $$ a year. Our next GREAT LEADER is taking lessons from Trudeau.
9936 2018-08-13 01:23:34 I made one with that, apple cider vinegar, water and a little jojoba oil. 
9937 2018-08-13 01:22:58 We reject corporate money and the oil and gas walk back. We call for a #GreenNewDeal now that moves us to a renewable future for the environment and our national security. Where are you there? You want our support, you need more than a good fight against corruption.
9938 2018-08-13 01:22:56 @realDonaldTrump why did the government make our potato chip companies change their oil?! The Gov. Forced Jones potato chips in Mansfield,OH to change and now my beloved #Ballreichs potato chips in @Jim_Jordan tiffin,OH?! Why does the Gov feel it necessary to interfere in chips!
9939 2018-08-13 01:22:51 それはまじでくずですね〜
9940 2018-08-13 01:22:24 I knowww it’s insane i think this’ll be her first time playing Lucas oil ?? I believe she played an arena down there last tour but idk i didn’t go down there for 1989
9941 2018-08-13 01:22:14 PS: oil prices remaining artificially high in 2010~2015 (QE, threat of escalation with Iran) lead to the development of many previously unsound projects (shale, sand, Arctic, pre salt, ...) and peak oil lost its appeal, so the renewables people successfully rebranded!
9942 2018-08-13 01:21:45 You are probably right.  Donald Trump was her mentor after all.  She learned first hand from the snake oil salesman himself.

9950 2018-08-13 01:19:58 Has your industry ever had talks on forming a cartel ? Why do the oil guys get a cartel & you don't ?
9951 2018-08-13 01:19:56 True life I just tried to pour a few drops of spearmint essential oil on my tongue, but I forgot I took the drop cap off and poured a whole gulp of spearmint oil all over my mouth and chin and now it burns and every time I get near my boo he squints and his eyes water

9960 2018-08-13 01:19:11 True. But the specs are just arbing out the supply & demand. If there's lots of farmers quitting, then prices should go up. Even with a cartel, there is still a market. Like oil.

9964 2018-08-13 01:18:21 If there is anything that working in the beauty industry has taught me, it’s that you don’t need to spend hundreds of dollars on moisturizer, hair product etc, all you need is a ton of coconut oil
9965 2018-08-13 01:18:20 Yes our priest told us about giving his Mom the cloth with the chrism oil and his Dad the purple stole he wore to hear his 1st confessions. His parents will be buried with these items. He was crying..I was crying..everybody was crying! Beautiful!
9966 2018-08-13 01:18:17 Oil prices inched up on Monday as U.S. sanctions against Iran pointed towards a tighter market, although concerns over slowing economic growth amid global trade tensions kept a lid on gains.

9970 2018-08-13 01:17:48 Controlling/regulating oil prices, the ability to tell all the Arabs that the US is neutral, even though it supports Israel ("Hey! We're friends with everyone.

9981 2018-08-13 01:15:18  I do no olive oil, very light on butter. Finish on fully preheated grill, 1m per side. BBQ is also super good, super easy. I finish on hot pan with a little more BBQ to get a good glaze.
9982 2018-08-13 01:14:40 It is pointless arguing with idiots like yourself or @Julius_S_Malema who are simply blind to the consequences of Chavez's nationalization of the oil industry, agricultural operations, transportation, power generation, telecommunications, steel production, banks, etc.

9999 2018-08-13 01:10:57 Serve with Jasmine rice. I sometimes use Traders Joe’s Orange vinegar in the oil stage and will throw in water chestnuts, cashews, mini corn, and/or bean sprout depending on my mood. Enjoy! 6/6
