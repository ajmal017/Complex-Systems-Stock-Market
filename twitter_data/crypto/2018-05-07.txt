1 2018-05-07 23:59:59 I love crypto because I loathe the current corrupt financial system. I work on my 1963 Cadillac and play with my kids. Hairless cat not sure why. Thanks, you're pretty cute yourself.

3 2018-05-07 23:59:13 Who is getting rich in the “Markets?”  

Very few!  

Why is that?  

Because most have no idea how to navigate the “Markets” successfully, right?  

Who benefits from a Crypto-currency that is traded on an “Exchange?”  

The people that own the “Exchange” is the correct answer!

Buffett is going senile, and bitcoin will outlast him. 

There, I said it.
