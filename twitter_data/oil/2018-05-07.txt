1 2018-05-07 23:59:47 pls stop texting cisco is vegetable oil when vegetables
2 2018-05-07 23:59:37 CBD oil is no joke. Find some today and give it a try. All kinds of health benefits!!!
3 2018-05-07 23:59:35 Reptiles do not perspire, and do not have any oil glands
4 2018-05-07 23:59:10 Oil Sykes has said their new album is going to be pop looooool rest in peace BMTH

6 2018-05-07 23:58:54 Let's do a quick comparison: My followers are real live people who have normal goals, school work and work schedules. They even have their real pictures up

Yours are Russian bots and losers with identity struggles so severe, they have Trump & oil painted flags as their avi
7 2018-05-07 23:58:38 Bones dont turn to oil
8 2018-05-07 23:58:37 For free! Lucky lucky lucky! 

I also use coconut oil for infusing with cannabis
9 2018-05-07 23:58:21 We also threatened them just like we have the middle east. Because Lord Rothschild wants that oil and America is his lap dog. Might wanna do a little research for yourself instead of listening to fox and cnn
10 2018-05-07 23:57:54 does putting coconut oil in ur coffee have a purpose
11 2018-05-07 23:57:52 Hebrews 1 [NIV]
[vs: 9]  You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, your God, has set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy."
12 2018-05-07 23:57:37 Bullshit we produce most of the oil in the world and have no way to make gas. Fucking stupid .

15 2018-05-07 23:57:07 I spilled coconut oil all over my sweater today. I'm talking ALL OVER. A 5 lb. tub. Kept driving though.
16 2018-05-07 23:57:04 oh, thanks for the info!! I’ll experiment with them. (I used my mom’s 20+ year old oil paints in college too, there was a yellow that was especially bright)
17 2018-05-07 23:57:01 Thanks to for the oil
18 2018-05-07 23:56:41 Fish oil will help as well! It has so many amazing benefits aside from helping nourish hair!

38 2018-05-07 23:56:38 Mr. President you need to lower the gas prices we produce the most oil help us out it's very expensive
39 2018-05-07 23:56:33 I just saw a Facebook apology ad on TV.... so desperate. This is  just as bad as the BP oil spill apology tour of 2010.
40 2018-05-07 23:56:19 Good. Screw the iranies and proceed to cripple their economy once and for good. The last ball-less wonder couldn’t get it done. It’s only good for Canadian oil
41 2018-05-07 23:56:17 Yes, pulling out of the Iran agreement was Putin's idea.  However, Muhhammed bin Salman wants to see Saudi oil prices rise and dominate the oil market; Iran is interfering with that.  DJT & bin Salman are friends; an agreement has been made.  I fear U.S. troops will be sent in.
42 2018-05-07 23:56:11 Metal shards from the oil in my engine, hoping it’s from the worn cam follower that was replaced recently 
43 2018-05-07 23:56:05 "Even the Alberta Chamber of Resources, an industry lobby group, admits that the term 'oil sands' gained popularity in the mid-1990s, when government and industry began an aggressive public relations campaign to improve public perception of the dirty-sounding 'tar sands.'"
44 2018-05-07 23:55:59 I feel like the mentality is "I spoke up for women. They OWE me."
45 2018-05-07 23:55:54 @NikkoRMS also never go thru Manila heat without @belobeauty botox on the kili-kili! Goodbye jabar and oil on the face!
46 2018-05-07 23:55:41 Bought new '74 and it had MUSCLE! Mine was black, pistol grip shift, hand crank moon roof, bubble hood w/clips but seats fell apart at seams & burned oil - added white pin striping & mag wheels - lots of admirers when driving around Bay View, WI
47 2018-05-07 23:55:30 Checks out. Offshore oil drilling is just vaping the ocean floor
48 2018-05-07 23:55:24 Megan walks in my apartment today and goes “it always smells like olive oil in here” 
Is that a compliment?
49 2018-05-07 23:54:55 Trump will put out of the deal tomorrow and oil prices will go up Trump just want to undo everything president Obama put in place
50 2018-05-07 23:54:51 Gotcha. If you don't have an extreme, you may be interested by the Sure Lock. My normal go to on Longer patterns is Sure Lock with surface on fresh oil, then as the pattern breaks down (game 3,4) ill switch to my Code X for stronger finish/more angle down lane.
51 2018-05-07 23:54:38 But if you really hate your kids give them castor oil
52 2018-05-07 23:54:33 I can probably squeeze the oil out of his hair it's that bad
53 2018-05-07 23:54:30 Right when I want to wash my hair there’s no coconut oil
54 2018-05-07 23:54:28 reduction in size of a tumor is a normal result of taking cannabis and or the cbd oil.
Harvard medical school confirmed this. Keep up the good work.
55 2018-05-07 23:54:28 Thanks!  I love pretty bottles for my magic oil!

60 2018-05-07 23:53:13 Venezuela’s problem is predominately rule of law. Their geology is fantastic. They have Canada’s oil sands but in a tropical climate.

China’s geologic potential for shale gas is mostly mediocre.
61 2018-05-07 23:53:12 Tim Wilson said I could buy an oil company on $40 a day, so why don't we all do that?
62 2018-05-07 23:53:08 Mr mr. President would you be so kind as to lower the gas prices since we produce the most oil in the United States and help out the little people
63 2018-05-07 23:53:02 #Oil and #naturalgas for #extraction are #resources scarce and confined. #Wind and #sun are not. #renewableenergy #FossilFree
64 2018-05-07 23:53:01 Schneiderman doing the assaulting even other Democrat scumbags wouldn't do
65 2018-05-07 23:52:51 Hi Mr. President  if you just legalize marijuana a lot of our problems would end and the world would be a much happier place it might be a problem for the  Pharmacies and oil companies but they can just transition over too think about it come man
66 2018-05-07 23:52:26 From today on, no more unleaded gas in my car. It's plus all the way and I filled it up and added a fuel injection cleaner and gas saver that increases fuel economy. N I made sure tire pressure is on point. Its Oil change tomorrow...
67 2018-05-07 23:52:25 If heard the oil is good, not so sure about your driving though! 
68 2018-05-07 23:52:25 Is that the same Green Party that is obstructing a pipeline in BC trying to kill all off Alberta’s oil industry?
69 2018-05-07 23:52:23 It shouldn't be up to the American taxpayer to pay every other foreigners way to security. Its bullshit. We aren't over there for weapons. We are over there to take control of oil in the region and establish a Rothschild owned Bank. Same as every war before it.
70 2018-05-07 23:52:21 My mom gave my cbd oil for my mono and I’ve been dripping it on this popsicle 
71 2018-05-07 23:52:14 俺が人の顔憶えてるのって凄いことだよ！（）
72 2018-05-07 23:52:03 That CBD oil stuff didn't do much then pal! Cortisone it is 
73 2018-05-07 23:51:59 @beautybakerie always tickles my fancy lovely frens at asos but ...  I've got most of what's left on the site already haha I was looking forward to new things such as the new foundation or the baking oil 
74 2018-05-07 23:51:52 Me coming downstairs when the cops tell me my 70 year old oil tycoon husband died in a mysterious fire
75 2018-05-07 23:51:51 but then when i go back to eating they'll get oil on them again!

this will necessitate multiple "wiping phases" thus increasing my negative contributions to environmental pollution, thus accelerating global warming doom

are you telling me to damn humanity for a tweet kara?
76 2018-05-07 23:51:41 We used to smoke in a friend's garage.  She never noticed.  One day we had a friend wearing patchouli oil, she had a fit and threw us out.
77 2018-05-07 23:51:33 During the reign of the Shah, the Iranian oil industry was briefly nationalised under Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh.  A US and UK-backed coup d'état deposed Mosaddegh and brought back foreign oil firms.  Strong opposition to the corrupt Shah finally forced him to leave Iran.
78 2018-05-07 23:51:28 I will be looking at that article after I type this.
A question for you, if the oil overnight disappeared, how much of a impact would that be on the Albertian economy?
79 2018-05-07 23:51:24 Everytime I finish washing my face and then I use toner, my face glows so I can’t see the difference between glowing and oily sometimes. The struggle is also real I need to use like 3 sheets of oil paper per day.
80 2018-05-07 23:51:20 I think people are grossly overestimating the Iran Deal or sanctions removing oil from the market anytime soon. I think that will keep Iran from increasing it much and likely see declines in a year or two. It also doesn’t matter, as we’re already in a pretty large deficit.
81 2018-05-07 23:51:17 Why won't these freaking gnats leave my alooone  I have doused myself in tea tree oil and they're still following me whyyyy  I just wanna sleeeep 
82 2018-05-07 23:51:16 this is unacceptable and outrageous. we are an energy rich/oil rich nation and foodbank use is rising daily, imagine what it's going to be like post brexit.
83 2018-05-07 23:51:14 Lmfao Kaluuya been eating straight peanut butter stew with extra palm oil
84 2018-05-07 23:51:12 @realDonaldTrump Get ready to take responsibility for increased oil prices.
85 2018-05-07 23:51:11 I'm grinding 3-4 mostly because I can use part of the low-oil grinding team for it (those two Fletcher-class DD's I'm running) and mitigate the oil cost while spamming oil commissions in the background.
86 2018-05-07 23:51:10 Why doesn't the US join OPEC? Cutting oil output would raise oil prices, give Republicans higher oil profits and give Democrats more competitive green energy, while the corresponding decrease in oil use would cut greenhouse gas emissions. Everybody wins!
87 2018-05-07 23:51:01 (´･ω･｀)
88 2018-05-07 23:50:44 Not in my area, I am just south of the 2nd largest oil area in the province.  Companies are closing & leaving on an almost weekly basis.  3 major companies just in the last 2 weeks.  Not sure where you live? But it’s not good where I am.

92 2018-05-07 23:49:53 Actually can’t sleep unless I’m drowning in lavender oil
93 2018-05-07 23:49:49 Pretty sweet being a Texas oil company in Canada under NAFTA eh? 
You don't even have to try to build a pipeline you can just huff and puff and watch your Canadian cheerleaders demand the government send you bags of taxpayers money. #petrostatewelfarebums
94 2018-05-07 23:49:45 I’m so glad I got this job in the oil field thanks to  @tootrippy_arson  @melchor_111 
95 2018-05-07 23:49:31 Is it me or does greasy snake oil man Giuliani looks like he's about to foam at the mouth?
96 2018-05-07 23:49:25 Got my MCT oil, ketone urine test strips, and I think I’m in ketosis! It feels like Christmas. So much energy!!! I feel like I could workout again and I already did this morning! The urine strip after eating is moderate on the urine ketone strip. Must be close or in it
97 2018-05-07 23:49:21 @realDonaldTrump  70 DOLLAR OIL???
98 2018-05-07 23:49:20 @GeraldoRivera once again trying to sell a secret underground vault in Chicago on @TheStoryFNC. Selling his snake oil keeps him relevant. Or so both @FoxNews and himself believe.

100 2018-05-07 23:49:19 Ricotta-Cream Cheese Stuffed Squash Blossom drizzled with MF cold pressed coconut oil and balsamic vinegar.
101 2018-05-07 23:49:16 The only pipeline I'm concerned about is the one that goes from my mouth to my ass. You'll get some natural gas out of it, but no oil.
102 2018-05-07 23:49:00 Someone’s going to benefit - won’t be you or me (unless you own an oil company!)
103 2018-05-07 23:48:47 i don't want to get oil on my keyboard

america might invade it
104 2018-05-07 23:48:32 Drng ol man just sprey the old oil down the dril hole then lub'er up the tap and tunr'r round slwoly ol man.

106 2018-05-07 23:48:18 Awesome tell me how it turns out! Some people blend it longer and add more oil, even a bit of water (or the water in the chick peas can) if they like it creamy, some blend it shorter if they like that chunky stuff
107 2018-05-07 23:48:15 Ya MCM lets the hibachi Man Squirt the Oil in His Mouth 
108 2018-05-07 23:47:54 Even I saute it with garlic, and sometimes add a bit of olive oil & balsamic vinegar. And I'm that kind of person who actually likes the taste of greens, haha.
109 2018-05-07 23:47:28 First, oil went down months before the 2015 election. Second, we are right next door to a province that experienced a very similar downturn but took a different approach to ameliorating it. Alberta’s approach is proving to be superior. #abpoli #ableg #yeg #yyc
110 2018-05-07 23:47:23 I love what it would do for the economy. We still get oil from the saudis. So whats your point or was that it.
111 2018-05-07 23:47:21 Foaming agent castor oil 
112 2018-05-07 23:47:08 Coconut oil. Fixes everything.

114 2018-05-07 23:46:59 Work day "ended" 45 mins ago, and now I'm waiting for my girl @KellyJMacIntosh so we can burn the midnight oil. Exhibitions open Sunday morning!
115 2018-05-07 23:46:46 If anyone’s car needs an oil change I probably have enough on my face for multiple cars
116 2018-05-07 23:46:32 I’ve never found myself attracted to oil before
117 2018-05-07 23:46:23 my hands had olive oil on them, i couldn't type!
118 2018-05-07 23:46:03 乗ってる電車もはや俺が走るスピードくらいしか出てない
119 2018-05-07 23:45:58 Hey dahboo7 I got some you should be looking into it just got done raining where I live and the rain is almost like a greasy type oil the strange part is the last time it rained the rain was burning our skin sort of unusual some you might want to look into
120 2018-05-07 23:45:51 Pop more till you’re spirit leaves
121 2018-05-07 23:45:47 I went from selling pounds eating ramen noodles every day to Securing Oil field bags blowing money living with no stress 
122 2018-05-07 23:45:46 Mix 1/3 cup Danish pastry with 11 lbs Danish pastry. Add Olive Oil. Set aside for 3 days Serve with chili
123 2018-05-07 23:45:45 Of all the things we can blame on Trump right now, I fear the Iran situation has nothing to do with him. The ramp to war with them has way more to do with their Oil Bourse ceasing taking dollars to fulfill delivery contracts than it does thier effectively crippled nuclear program
124 2018-05-07 23:45:43 I wonder how much oil based products are used to make your EV?
125 2018-05-07 23:45:37 My guess is you have never heard of a spin off job. Who do you think is going to be working to fill the pipeline? I’m also guessing you’d rather see the oil come by train or truck? Either way it’s going to come.
126 2018-05-07 23:45:36 Take CBD oil.. it is cheaper and works better for most illnesses anyways.. and the good thing ..it is legal in all states :D
127 2018-05-07 23:45:20 That happens so often. Someone with absolutely no issues-very minor issues, spouts about, “I use coconut oil and water and St. Ives scrub!” Like please for the love of god don’t follow she’s threads! See a pro!
128 2018-05-07 23:45:17 2) The last time I checked - about 5 years ago - the growth rates still correlate, with Protestant influenced countries out preforming Catholic influenced and both out preforming others. The significant exception has been oil rich Muslim lands since 1967 -->
129 2018-05-07 23:45:12 Finished my van today, well mostly so, just need an oil change and a few minor things.
130 2018-05-07 23:45:09 I will be tweeting any new words along with their meanings which I come across through out the day.

*Siesta- a nap.

*Resplendent- shiny and colorful.

131 2018-05-07 23:45:09 Deffinitely shrinks them and makes them appear smaller im sure ive seen some incredible before and after pics, helps acne scars as well, i will say your supposed to use a vitamin c oil after treatment to help repair skin basically what the roller does is puncture it enough

133 2018-05-07 23:44:48 @ScottPruittOK 90 thousand barrels of oil. What if it was in your neighborhood or do you think it will never happen to someone you love? Do you think you can protect them all from the poisons you allow to be spilled. Everywhere. It will get to your loved ones too, you monster.

137 2018-05-07 23:44:09 Extra tips
My dad would say to leave the blender going, and squirt in a bit of lemon juice, then a bit of oil, and back and forth til you're done both
Add fresh dill if frisky
Add more garlic if friskier
Use best olive oil you can afford, shitty chick peas/tahini don't matter
138 2018-05-07 23:44:08 I still think that's super cool
139 2018-05-07 23:44:02 Going to make that whole plan to blackmail oil producers to fill the state coffers and line his pockets awfully challenging.....
140 2018-05-07 23:44:01 yeaaaaaah fuck this. somebody bring me some castor oil

143 2018-05-07 23:43:12 U said u wanna leave it all in the ground, so therefore u must be ready to give up everything in your life that requires any oil based products, so you can start by getting rid of it all(recycling of course)
144 2018-05-07 23:42:57 In the Dettman quote she says it is bitumen, which they call "oil". Sorry, that's not science, it's convenience.
145 2018-05-07 23:42:54 " OwO What's this?"
*blows up Oil Refinery*
146 2018-05-07 23:42:52 i feel so sick  not a good feeling at OIL!!!
147 2018-05-07 23:42:42 Just like when Tillerson changed Mobil oil Exxon Mobil. New name, same old gas.
148 2018-05-07 23:42:40 Liz was doing all sorts of things to that cake mix back there.  I mean the mix is usually add a couple of eggs and some oil. #GH
149 2018-05-07 23:42:37 I've never seens such a descriptive text about someone's oil in my entire life xD

152 2018-05-07 23:42:15 @RepMattGaetz you keep your opinion out of the Venezuelan issue! Neither Donald Trump nor any member of the GOP/Tea Party should be sticking their nose in Venezuelan politics. They need help alright but not from oligarch oil cartels from this country or others connected them.
153 2018-05-07 23:42:06 As far as I know the sanctions are all on individuals. What does that have to do with oil revenues, or state revenues generally?

156 2018-05-07 23:41:53 And what exactly did the your party do to curb emissions in Canada, Alberta cut it coal fired power plants while Quebec has the biggest cement plant in North America that have no new emissions in place, dumping of raw sewer into oceans on east and west coast and importing oil

168 2018-05-07 23:40:16 Hey @TeamstersLU630 you should support opening the OCS.   Instead of sending $5 BILLION to Saudi Arabia or buying Ruasian oil ask @MaxineWaters why we can't create jobs in our OCS for CA workers.

172 2018-05-07 23:39:20 It’s sad what Chavez/Maduro have done to Venezuela.  People, kids are dying from hunger in the nation w the biggest oil reserves in the world.
173 2018-05-07 23:39:15 It shouldn’t take this long for a damn oil change 
174 2018-05-07 23:39:08 You need to try to get the bath oil, green cap, it's still available in America so you might get from (dare I say) amazon. It's the original stuff and works so well plus it's a great body lotion. 
Deet works but it's nasty stuff, it melts plastic so I'm wary of it.
175 2018-05-07 23:39:06 Yes, I believe that to be true. Let's let the price of oil rise and rise.  Best shot at pissing off most Americans...
176 2018-05-07 23:39:05 Most of this is tax and imported oil smart guy! So yes they influence prices. Duh!

190 2018-05-07 23:37:05 That’s not how carbon storage works, you’re describing capturing it back into a cycle, but as trees die the carbon is re-released. Oil has stored it for millions of years, trees, only hundreds.

200 2018-05-07 23:35:39 Neither of those are accurate. 1) The Iran Nuclear deal(it's a deal because a treaty wouldn't have gotten through Congress, so Obama went around the process) was brought about by the last administration, so their word is different than this one's
2) OPEC decides the price of oil.

It’s possible to be a fan of electric car tech, renewable energy and not think it will be viable for anything near this guys timelines.

221 2018-05-07 23:32:37 As Golda said, she had issues with Moses, because he lead the Jews through the desert for 40 years only to plant them in the only part of the Middle East that has no oil.
222 2018-05-07 23:32:32 To spell it out: Iran relies on oil revenue. Domestic unrest ensues with lack of gov't economic focus on wages, infrastructure, social services. Sanctions increase this potential and reduce ability of gov't to pursue nuclear weapons program.
223 2018-05-07 23:32:14 Because the @CanadiensMTL have always been bad at humour. They've been a serious, boring org forever and change directions like an oil tanker.

231 2018-05-07 23:31:55 This is about vacationing not war. The US doesn't have to fight to free any country, but it shouldn't support a country with no human rights.

274 2018-05-07 23:25:29 The world is a glut of oil. Saudi's bought 100s billions weapons & need $'s pay for it, so raise price of oil. The war hawks & propaganda blaming rise of oil on Iran~LIES. It is true Trump wants leave Middle East, needs 100s billions for US Fed Gov & needs new cop in Middle East
275 2018-05-07 23:25:20 Absolutely. The whole city is tied to oil and gas. On top of this, the constant water problems. Definitely all connected, very sad

291 2018-05-07 23:23:13 こんなに人でごった返すの絶対におかしい
292 2018-05-07 23:23:11 But his Wall St friends will make bank on oil. Tillerson might even get his Russia deal back on track
293 2018-05-07 23:23:02 Higher oil prices are not bullish

296 2018-05-07 23:22:37 @Five_Guys we went to the store on Hwy MO 1 today. We ordered two burgers and fries. But when we got home the fries were limp & raw-ish. Probably not hot enough oil. We threw them in the trash. Just bummed and disappointed
297 2018-05-07 23:22:36 Honestly broke my heart. My entire life is down there.  And the people are so tied to the oil/gas industry that I don’t see them uniting against the industries that are poisoning them. I hope I’m really wrong.
298 2018-05-07 23:22:35 You gave me an unnecessary attitude at Ogba market like someone hot red oil burnt her leg. We just had to pass a narrow space and you shoved me like it's your birthright. You could have been civil. I can't watch any movie you act in.

301 2018-05-07 23:22:30 That would be great and it would hold these radical environmentalists lefties at tides etc accountable for their lies and attacks on our oil and gas workers and assaulting our country by holding us back economically too #co2islifenotpollution
302 2018-05-07 23:22:28 This weekend I was making luxury sandwiches and now I’m doing a dinner pasta from the bodega (crushed tomato, garlic bulb, cheap olive oil, chili flakes, deli meat sliced fine ....)
303 2018-05-07 23:22:27 FX TODAY: 
QUIET RANGES OVERNIGHT WITH USD INDEX HIGHER INTO THE CLOSE. FOCUS TODAY IN ASIA WILL BE ON AUS RETAIL SALES AND CHINA DATA, HOWEVER BIG PICTURE IS STILL ON USD STRENGTH AND OIL PRICES. AUD SUPPORT STILL AT 0.7470. RISK TO BREAK TOPSIDE 0.7560 IN THE COMING DAYS
304 2018-05-07 23:22:16 I just deleted my tweets saying Koch bros made their billions by fracking. This is wrong. They made their billions by inventing cracking large oil molecules to smaller molecules creating gasoline. Sorry for this!
305 2018-05-07 23:22:12 And what brand of oil paint is that
306 2018-05-07 23:22:11 お大事に
307 2018-05-07 23:22:02 Such a relief !!  Wow !! Thank you Ken
308 2018-05-07 23:21:59 Nah I like the utter picture more
309 2018-05-07 23:21:51 So disappointed & frustrated w/ @AllStarKIASB went in for an oil change & apparently 5 hrs is not enough time to have 1 done. I understand appts are recommended, but appts being at 2 wks out, walk ins should not be the impossible. @Kia @Kia_Motors #CUSTOMERSERVICEFAIL
310 2018-05-07 23:21:50 frying oil*
311 2018-05-07 23:21:43 Certainly the 83% of elitist that got the tax give away, have not forgotten your extreme generosity. It will be interesting to see how much you & family Trump benefitted from this give away. Pruett’s minions, the oil industry will get the great majority back, with gas increases.
312 2018-05-07 23:21:37 Its actually about the oil my forever AŞK but let it unfild naturally :”)

315 2018-05-07 23:21:03 Dr Oz was just like every other us cardiac surgeon in his beliefs until he discovered there was more money to be had in showcasing a wide range of snake oil.  It makes little difference to me which untruth he is peddling.
316 2018-05-07 23:20:54 We're exporting oil. Keep corn for food and feed, and save energy.
317 2018-05-07 23:20:50 things getting done: teachers on strike, oil drilling on Federal Parklands, soaring grocery prices, prescription drugs costs more than I make in 4 yrs. for 1 mo. supply ($34,000.00! ), reducing a disabled person's SSI benefits to $140.00 a month. Yup we are getting done all right

319 2018-05-07 23:20:45 Alot of the oil stocks went from green in the morning to red in the afternoon today.
320 2018-05-07 23:20:41 Same here. Arms for hostages. A thing we As a Country pledged never to do. Negotiate with Terrorists. North did, but President Carter would not, and the GOP ran against Carter because of Iran and the oil embargo. The evaporated once Reagan was elected. Tactic feels familiar??!
321 2018-05-07 23:20:35 We have such an opportunity to be leaders in green energy with so much talent but... green doesn't payout like oil companies and @StephenMcNeil needs to build his nest so....
322 2018-05-07 23:20:24 Olive oil, s and p. Going on the grill in a little bit.
323 2018-05-07 23:20:12 I took my car in for an oil change and while they were raising it up the brake pads fell out... $600 later I have new brakes, a headlight, and an oil change... welcome to my life 
324 2018-05-07 23:20:00 Have no fear, there will be more.
325 2018-05-07 23:19:56 OUT THE DOOR THEY GO! NO MORE MONEY. STOP BUYING ANYTHING from them. We never dealt w/ Mid-East 4 years.(Oil Petro dollar problem)!  America needs 2 start over,we R spoiled. Hard times will make a stronger Nation. Default on all World notes, will bring the World 2 there knees 2!
326 2018-05-07 23:19:42 When you come to jiffy lube to get an 85$ oil change then end up getting all this extra ish and paying $300  I’m about to go home and cry
327 2018-05-07 23:19:36 I only have like 2.5 weeks of the semester left and my backpack has a hole AND motor oil spilled all over it :(
328 2018-05-07 23:19:31 buying an essential oil diffuser is the best thing i’ve ever done for myself

331 2018-05-07 23:19:12 What are you talking about?
332 2018-05-07 23:19:07 Let’s do “ONLY IN AMERICA”!  ONLY IN AMERICA can you be arrested for possession of a weed!
ONLY IN AMERICA do gas prices go up when Republicans are in the Oval Office while we are told there are shortages, and oil companies make record profits!  Share yours!
333 2018-05-07 23:19:00 They just came out w/ a new one that has black castor oil, flaxseed, Shea butter and olive oil 
334 2018-05-07 23:18:53 You've obviously never called your dad after getting an oil change.  And I will keep posting crappy memes as long as the internet exists 
335 2018-05-07 23:18:49 Best for Canada or just Alberta? Considering oil is hovering around 2-3% of Canada’s GDP I would say it’s the latter.
336 2018-05-07 23:18:29 Story of my life

341 2018-05-07 23:17:39 @realDonaldTrump why are we still dealing with opec? we dont need their oil at all.
stop exporting usa oil. keep us oil in america. abolish opec and bring to usa real- prices not inflated greed and corrupt prices inflated by opec.
342 2018-05-07 23:17:36 Katie,Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly Oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off Buildings. Pls tell @vancouverpride  how u rationalize obstructing  Gay friendly Oil while enriching Gay killing oil. @MikeSmythNews
343 2018-05-07 23:17:31 #ASX set to rise today following gains on Wall Street. The energy sector, bolstered by the surging oil price led the gains, with Apple lifting the tech sector. Dow Jones +0.4%, S&P 500 closed +0.4% & NASDAQ +0.8%. ASX futures +20 pts.
344 2018-05-07 23:17:22 Same thing happened to Notley at the "leap manifesto" convention - and she's apparently campaigning for oil pipelines.
345 2018-05-07 23:17:20 Will occur just like Peak Oil
346 2018-05-07 23:17:20 Oh. Now I get it. Trump is against the Iran deal because he wants to drive up oil prices. Who does this benefit besides OPEC and US oil companies? ... Can you say Russia?
@realDonaldTrump
@POTUS
@WhiteHouse
347 2018-05-07 23:17:15 Is this the WINNING Donald was talking about?
 Winning for the oil companies, not for citizens of the U.S.

350 2018-05-07 23:16:46 I can’t smoke weed at all. CBD oil doesn’t make me feel weird at all.
351 2018-05-07 23:16:41 And we are surprised because.....
Low oil prices = Saudi Arabia Oil Diplomacy
High oil Prices = Higher Saudi Arabia Revenue
US Energy Independence = Saudi Arabia sells oil to China or engages in Global Oil Diplomacy.
Slim.
352 2018-05-07 23:16:26 So is President Trump courting sanctions on Iran because of nuclear issues or because his oil friends are enjoying the rise in oil prices?...  Stop milking Americans to pad your pockets.

357 2018-05-07 23:16:01 Oil now nudging $US70 a barrel - highest since 2014. Waiting to see the stories on high priced petrol eating into spending of mums/dads
358 2018-05-07 23:16:01 I would also like to add snake oil salesmen with all the anti consumer bull they are trying to pull all the time
359 2018-05-07 23:15:48 my dad sent me CBD oil in the mail cause he told me i need to calm the fuck down. i got a panic attack after taking it. slept for 4 hours. and now i’m stress eating. at this point i don’t think anything will fix me.
360 2018-05-07 23:15:43 This!!! Hell they way they wrote even has my PM doctor scared out of his gourd He even says I need a higher dose but he is to scared to raise it and told me to use CBD oil or get MJ and he would warn me a month ahead of pee Test I mean WTF really?
361 2018-05-07 23:15:41 I swear coconut oil can be used for anything. Wanna cook? Coconut oil. Got frizzy hair? Coconut oil. Got wrinkles? Coconut oil. Does your dog want a treat? Coconut oil. Want shiny smooth skin? Coconut oil. Want to get rid of shitty ppl? Coconut oil.
362 2018-05-07 23:15:32 Heard today: "Data IS the oil of the digital age"...#tech #data #BusinessIntelligence
363 2018-05-07 23:15:22 Check your Transmission oil this morning.
364 2018-05-07 23:15:13 Trump is just taking credit for what Obama did. Did Trump make the Iran deal? No, he didn't Obama made it. Then if Trump gets rid of the Iran deal gas and oil will go sky high so Trump is a fool. Then on unemployment they are just taking credit for what Obama did.
365 2018-05-07 23:15:12 Step one: get 3 tampons, 5 packets of mild sauce from Taco Bell, and some petroleum based lunrucation (grease is better but oil works).
Step two: mix the mild sauce and lubrication
366 2018-05-07 23:14:44 Sitting at my desk at work and I have an eyelash curler, mascara, lip oil, 2 chapsticks, 1 nude lipstick, lip gloss, pressed powder and an eyebrow pencil all in one desk drawer. 
367 2018-05-07 23:14:32 this is so stressful and it’s not even my oil that’s getting changed
368 2018-05-07 23:14:31 I'm so poorly and all I want is a cuddle off my cat in the bed but he's got a hatred for the smell of Olbas Oil and keeps running away from me.
369 2018-05-07 23:14:28 That awkward moment when you go in for an oil change and walk out with a new car.
370 2018-05-07 23:14:06 And we can’t get Canadian oil to Canadians. How screwed up is this country?
371 2018-05-07 23:13:49 To use an oil, n it not show up on a drug test or ua after time

373 2018-05-07 23:13:05 Why can nobody say massive profit taking by the oil companies? Taxes are a large part but mostly fixed.
374 2018-05-07 23:13:03 Yep my car too low for my fatass to change my own oil LMFAO never again
375 2018-05-07 23:13:00 Ojala, y el estado se haga cargo también de toda la deuda que tienen con los empleados todas las empresas del grupo, y la deuda que tienen con los proveedores. El valor de Oil y del grupo hoy es negativo, pero espero que cobre la gente lo que le corresponde.
376 2018-05-07 23:12:57 Hello there.  I know it's late to ask, but with his quirk, is Abe's arms, hands, n forehead always black-colored with oil? He can't naturally change them back into his normal skin color?

378 2018-05-07 23:12:34 Bush didn’t go in for oil he went in for hamsters... #conspiracy
379 2018-05-07 23:12:30 @POTUS Oil Prices are rising not because we don't have enough production, its the oil speculators driving up prices from @realDonaldTrump confusion over the Iran Deal that has nothing to do with America supplies of #oil .. Go Figure!
380 2018-05-07 23:12:29 from where you live rather than something that goes through a small portion which you probably don’t live near.   From what I hear the east imports from Saudi...  why doesn’t East Canada get oil from the west? Rather from importing?  I bet it’s a lot cheaper than importing it.
381 2018-05-07 23:12:15 Lol, you have a point.
382 2018-05-07 23:12:03 Every dish that has oil or is not extra spicy makes me nauseous these days. I can feel the vomit crawling up my throat from just biting into a scotch egg.
383 2018-05-07 23:11:53

385 2018-05-07 23:11:35 Lmao literally all I use is an exfoliating pad with Clean and Clear deep action exfoliating scrub after that I use sea breeze astringent and once that dries I put vitamin E oil on. And drink lots of water (:
386 2018-05-07 23:11:02 Coconut oil can be good for the vagina, but all douching removes your natural flora and makes your vigina filled with free space for other bacteria and/or yeast to flurish causing infections and vaginitis. Your best protection for a healthy PH and vagina is your natural vagina.
387 2018-05-07 23:10:44 Graciasvolver pronto 
388 2018-05-07 23:10:42 I love rediscovering bands I loved MANY years ago, and tonight I have rediscovered Midnight Oil. Holy C A T S.

390 2018-05-07 23:10:37 He was a CIA assest until Bush felt he crossed the line in wanting to sell his oil in a currency other than US Federal notes...

396 2018-05-07 23:10:14 I still open the door, pull the chair out and pour the drink.  I'll change the oil or cook.. your choice.
397 2018-05-07 23:10:13 はぁ
398 2018-05-07 23:10:12 Peak oil fabricated too? I'm sure it's fine if you love fracking but that ain't good for a country on a fault line.
399 2018-05-07 23:10:10 BTW That section of Brooklyn is Williamsburg. & that pizza is a 10+ eaten there many times. The crust was charred just right. The oil comes from the sauce. If this pompous ass knew anything about pizza,  then he’d know good sauce is made with olive oil!!
400 2018-05-07 23:10:05 Exactly, if a war with Iran erupts the price of oil can go further up, so people in the West pay more to run their cars. In Britain the price of petrol is £1.22 for a litre.

#oil #maintenance #adulting #Ford #FordNation
403 2018-05-07 23:09:37 Says you, the gas prices should be a reflection of International prices because India imports oil. Unless we have a GDP of 10-11% we are doomed, this govt has smartly diverted our attention to petty politics of religion and caste instead of good governance
404 2018-05-07 23:09:21 I remember my Dad taking us to DePalmas Apizza in the sixties to pick up our pies.  (And probably so Mom could have a half hour alone) plain = sauce, oregano, olive oil, grated cheese.  Perhaps an acquired taste
405 2018-05-07 23:09:14 New fracking techniques might make it profitable. American oil companies are looking for 90 to 120 dollars a barrel. Oil price right now around 76.
406 2018-05-07 23:09:11 lmao you know coconut oil is my holy water
407 2018-05-07 23:08:56 . And thus sopping up all demand for oil and gas equities for the next few months

409 2018-05-07 23:08:53 Absolutely. But you're assuming that the customers can tell snake oil from reality. Do you think the existing manufacturers AREN'T "promising vastly better uptime"? Like, ALL of them? Always? 'Cause... they are. You're asking machinists to understand IT, basically. (1/?)
410 2018-05-07 23:08:24 Vitamin E oil is good too.

412 2018-05-07 23:08:11 I put basmati + water + salt + oil in a plastic lunchbox and microwave for about 13mins. Done
413 2018-05-07 23:07:42 It's absolutely beyond me how u managed to spin this crazy money going to more weapons and more oil as a form of victory..
414 2018-05-07 23:07:33 John, Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly Oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off Buildings. Pls tell @vancouverpride @PrideToronto how u rationalize obstructing  Gay friendly Oil while enriching Gay killing oil
415 2018-05-07 23:07:31 Topping up your foreign funded TIDES Foundation paycheck. Opposing Canada’s Gay friendly Oil only enriches dictators from regimes that toss our  off buildings.
416 2018-05-07 23:07:26 Frank, Your hero Notley has created a politically un-certain investment climate in AB. Oil at $70, US energy is booming. Almost zero investment into NDP led AB.
417 2018-05-07 23:07:14 Best meal plan -if anyone doesn't know where to start: Big bowl of Green Salads with 1 piece of grass fed meat and some coconut oil or ghee.
418 2018-05-07 23:07:13 lol I'm so damned!!! It's like water and oil! 
419 2018-05-07 23:07:07 LOL I GOT MY ARTISTIC START MANY YEARS AGO WITH A MAIL ORDER COURSE FROM ART INSTRUCTION SCHOOL / I HAVE BEEN NOW OIL PAINTING & REACHING FOR 40 YEARS / I STILL LOVE PENCIL DRAWINGS
420 2018-05-07 23:07:02 45 et al are probably just cranking up a war involving oil - Iran & whomever - to boost oil prices. Keep his donor base happy
421 2018-05-07 23:07:01 In 2007 when the worlds economy was on fire and oil was $150.00 a barrel gas was a $1.50 a litre.. oil broke $70.00 a barrel for the first time since 2014 today it's obvious that the switch over to summer gas got fouled up by the the earths wobble ... no worries..
422 2018-05-07 23:06:55 You buying me some oil ?

426 2018-05-07 23:06:44 PNoy was lucky. 
Oil prices were in shambles bcos of fracking technology and development.
427 2018-05-07 23:06:43 Agreed on the flaws. I wouldn’t accept that the first gulf war was a Christian attack. I think most American aggression in the Middle East was about control of oil and enforcement of the petro-Dollar. You don’t want to know my thoughts on 9/11. You’d send me a box of aluminum lol
428 2018-05-07 23:06:37 ありがとうございます
429 2018-05-07 23:06:13 There's the huge voice of the Indigenous that seems to be missing from this equation. Canada's media & oil corporations are going to have to accept that Indigenous consent is an imperative.
430 2018-05-07 23:06:12 Is a tea drink called kambusha . Is good.  And pepermint oil pills
431 2018-05-07 23:06:07 basically it's:
-bring the tomato plants in 
-buy oil
432 2018-05-07 23:05:49 Crisped in the oven (w/ oil and salt) is pretty tasty, although it isn't worth the time and effort IMO.

440 2018-05-07 23:05:13 Summer-blend fuel is more expensive to make than winter-blend fuel. the process to produce it takes longer and is costlier. Second, the overall yield of gasoline per barrel of oil is lower. Estimates of the added cost per gallon for summer fuel range from  3 to 15cents.

578 2018-05-07 22:43:29 Guy, any way out to groom beard? 
IDK the oil I haven't used
579 2018-05-07 22:43:17 Just earlier, I applied oil onto my sword so it has great sharpness. If you touch it even slightly, your fingers would be cut and blood could spill.
580 2018-05-07 22:43:15 I literally suck when it comes to car maintenance. The exterior/interior be clean as hell but that oil change light is on okay!
581 2018-05-07 22:43:15 OIL ANDY @Trainwreckstv
582 2018-05-07 22:43:10 I think I bought a PUD of oil off that guy once
583 2018-05-07 22:43:02 Was it oil or POTUS tweet.
584 2018-05-07 22:42:43 Law and Kim G. mix like crude oil and water.

586 2018-05-07 22:42:33 They also allow oil to rule there.
587 2018-05-07 22:42:15 Exfoliate them. Oil them.
588 2018-05-07 22:42:00 For oil or telecommunications company 
589 2018-05-07 22:41:56 People are going to love driving with artificially inflated oil prices lol.
590 2018-05-07 22:41:45 Tomorrow I’m finally going to get an oil change
591 2018-05-07 22:41:45 Lol
592 2018-05-07 22:41:39 Marxists will seize on any issue to damage the country. So Cdn oil is bad and must be stopped at all cost, but Saudi oil used to make plastics in China is fine. Nothing to do with enviro. It all makes sense once you know their base goal.
593 2018-05-07 22:41:37 Well, I received oil from an oil-dripping icon allegedly; I have been to Jerusalem and attended the Holy Fire festivity; and I kissed the hand of a monk-priest who allegedly is a wonderworker and saint.
594 2018-05-07 22:41:31 Went to have my oil changed somewhere. 1st time they wouldnt, said drain nut was too tight and it would break. 2nd time, same issue....different vehicle. Went TF off on the whole staff. Haven't gone back since.
595 2018-05-07 22:41:16 Without store of raw oil and our own ability to refine it. We are in real danger. 

Losing the refineries was an LNP initiative. The same as killing manufacturing industry which is why we have 1.5 million looking for work.
596 2018-05-07 22:41:16 Cancer dies When you Eat cannabis Oil.
597 2018-05-07 22:41:15 Black Business and Black Brands and PR, Oil and Water. THINK ABOUT IT.
598 2018-05-07 22:40:36 It’s estimated that Viking Sun burnt about 42000 litres of Heavy Fuel Oil whilst moored for 60 hours in Greenwich. That results in a considerable volume of NOx!
599 2018-05-07 22:40:36 Y’all really overhype avocado bro. That shit is not good. If you gotta add all this extra shit for taste it’s trash. Y’all be adding oil/butter/salt for “taste” on that trash shit.
600 2018-05-07 22:40:35 Well since the pipeline approval was quid pro quo for the carbon plan...kiss your dirty tar oil economy goodbye.
601 2018-05-07 22:40:32 Sometimes ill be sitting quietly and i just think about the tweet that says “Kehlani look like she squirt engine oil”  and then im really disturbed for 45 seconds
602 2018-05-07 22:40:16 Yes. He needs high oil prices. Hasn’t said anything on Iran deal.

605 2018-05-07 22:39:48 Groupon saves life I just bought a $19 oil change for the place right across the street from me :’)
606 2018-05-07 22:39:41 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
607 2018-05-07 22:39:35 Please get your own healthcare system and your snake oil salesman doctors in order first before you have a go at ours. We have different system of regulation in the UK. Big pharma is not allowed to influence doctor prescribing in the UK
608 2018-05-07 22:39:34 Get a brain.
People are already dieing due to extreme weather events caused by climate change.
People have gotten cancers from water pollution due to oil spills. But hey ho , obvs
Why are there still 20+ toxic superfund sites undealt with in the US ?

610 2018-05-07 22:39:24 That's great. What about oil/gas costs; medical coverage costs; food costs? Why no comment on these RISING costs? Just another partisan hack pushing a really bad thing that YOU AND YOUR PARTY passed. SHAMEFUL
611 2018-05-07 22:39:12 As a longtime customer of your products, I was disappointed to see that you used palm oil, given its potential destructiveness. It’s good to see you are a member of RSPO, however, I would encourage pushing for a trusted 3rd party certification, such as ISO. @isostandards
612 2018-05-07 22:39:06 Funny I just came across a letter today from 1952 from the Canadian government to my mother, paying for her passage to Canada. The next document was her landed immigrant card which she had to repay that passage within one year or be deported. It was a privilege not a right.
613 2018-05-07 22:38:48 I went into T.J. Maxx to get my stepmom an oil diffuser for her birthday. I came out an hour and $200 later. 
614 2018-05-07 22:38:34 Oh yeah. Just imagine if the palm beach mall was the PALM BEACH MALL back in the G when they dropped 
615 2018-05-07 22:38:34 What’s up with using baby oil as lube?!?! Not a good idea..... #saynotoyeastinfections
616 2018-05-07 22:37:57 I’ve been using coconut oil on my hair for months and I just find out now that that’s what’s been making my hair fall out. My life is a lie.
617 2018-05-07 22:37:47 Voorbije 4 dagen was 't seismisch nogal onrustig. Over de hele wereld zagen we M 4, 5, 6. De #earthquake bij #Lousiana had zoals verwacht geen natuurlijke oorzaak.

618 2018-05-07 22:37:43 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
619 2018-05-07 22:37:27 Wondering how I’ve managed to catch the worlds worst cold on the hottest day ever. Pass me the tissues and olbas oil I won’t be sleeping tonight then x
620 2018-05-07 22:37:15 Omg they all are here!!!! My father is really tripping OMG CASTOR OIL!! I’m moving to the Islands
621 2018-05-07 22:37:07 Gee, could it be so that they can avoid having to post the facts, that global warming is real and needs to be addressed? If they did that, Pruitt's oil stock shares would be in jeopardy. We can't have that, now can we.... 
622 2018-05-07 22:37:07 My black oil bird seed brings all the cards to the yard
And they’re like,

623 2018-05-07 22:37:04 El productor cuando vende su fruta tiene varios gastos(Gas Oil, mano de obra, alquiler de maquinarias, etc) por eso prefieren tirar las frutas en vez de venderla a precio bajo, pero la gente que no tiene una puta idea, los critican.Ponete un sombrero agarren una pala  y hablamos!
624 2018-05-07 22:37:03 i just dropped a whole ass oil painting onto my bed and it didn’t land face down. i’ve escaped death once again.
625 2018-05-07 22:37:02 Paper, plastic… as Hillary would say, “what difference does it make?”  It’s a wash, trees or oil?  Almost identical “footprint.”
626 2018-05-07 22:36:50 The time was years ago. Better late than never though. Seriously dangerous situation that successive governments have allowed Australia to fall into. Renewable industry is also needed to reduce foreign oil dependence.
627 2018-05-07 22:36:41 I'm guessing some of your friends will be submitting trades on #oil at 1:59.... #Crude
628 2018-05-07 22:36:33 I'll wager withdrawal is already decided. Also, a preemptive invasion and occupation of Iran will be pondered. Reasoning will be to rid Iran of WMDs, change regime, and bring democracy to the "liberated" Iranians. Mission to cost less than $2B, & be paid for by oil revenues.
629 2018-05-07 22:36:31 i don’t know if anyone has suggested it already, but bio oil has completely done away with mine
630 2018-05-07 22:36:30 Totally. Having to winterize my mower and remember to change oil/drain gas is butts. Sure, I can’t hose down my mower anymore and I have to brush/pull the grass out but thus far the noise and vibration reduction, reliability and power have been *chefs kiss*
631 2018-05-07 22:36:22 But ion think the hype gon come back no time soon. Shoes are just shoes now

There are still more leftovers
That I just might eat.
Because I value Szechuan food more than my own body.

643 2018-05-07 22:34:12 Do we play music and merry to impress upon people that we are happy?

I'm yet to see any advert on our TV, be it for the banking, detergents, cooking oil that doesn't come with music and dancing
644 2018-05-07 22:34:00 SENATOR I WOULD WAIT ,5 YEARS WHEN OIL PRICES ARE HIGHER AND WE THAN HAVE LEVERAGE ;THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT WOULD BE LOOSING  LARGE REVENUE IF SANCTIONS WERE IN PLACE !LET THEM NOW GET THE TASTE OF MONEY!

651 2018-05-07 22:32:50 Your not making oil drum fires in your kitchen again are you?
652 2018-05-07 22:32:47 It’s finally melted coconut oil szn
653 2018-05-07 22:32:29 I’ve paid for an oil change, car inspection, gas, windshield wipers, wiper fluid, and the repairs to fix an oil leak all today. I no longer want a car. :’)
654 2018-05-07 22:32:14 I'm outside for like an hour and these mosquitos eating all the coconut oil off my legs.

656 2018-05-07 22:32:05 In the interest of transparency, it would be fair for media to identify the indigenous leaders who are paid as part of the U.S.-funded Tar Sands Campaign to sabotage oil exports from western Canada. Also fair to cover the views of First Nations who are supportive. #stopkm
657 2018-05-07 22:32:05 The lack of decent affordable housing so 30 year olds can't buy & barely afford rent. Millions like me turned there back on the politics of greed & evil wars, selling arms to both sides so the grab for oil easier. If it's militant to want a fairer freer society them count me in

660 2018-05-07 22:31:40 Leftover salsa verde (the Italian kind, not the Mexican) can be a wonderful salad dressing when loosened with lots more olive oil. All those mixed herbs! (Don't forget the mint, and don't neglect dill, which is not traditional but is indispensable in our house.)
661 2018-05-07 22:31:37 I need an oil change like rn 
662 2018-05-07 22:31:35 Hey no worries Adam I got your point there. I wonder what those soldiers, many of whom died for our freedom, would have thought about the immigration rules being thrown in our faces and our Prime Minister calling us racists because the thought of refugee tent cities  repulses us.
663 2018-05-07 22:31:30 My bath bomb recipe
1/2 cup of baking soda
1/4 cup of cornstarch 
1/4 cup of coconut oil

Colouring (optional)
Drops of essential oil

I hope this works for you!
664 2018-05-07 22:31:27 That is true, I think and as we have been saying we have a better oil environment now. But how much of this Iran deal has been built in? $0-5 the market will drop but it will rise again.  will support prices, I thought they would go under last year but likely this year.
665 2018-05-07 22:31:26 Nothing is perfect, but essentially, Harper and Kenney tried the ol' end around. If they hadn't, well, who knows? It still might not be feasible even if it got going, other than we'd at least end our reliance on foreign oil. It would also be a bonus if we had a refinery.

675 2018-05-07 22:30:43 Most modern cars you can drive on ethanol! Just build facilities for farmers to produce and the same with diesel cars works perfect on vegetarian oil! easy to produce!
676 2018-05-07 22:30:41 Agree MI many factors set the price. If China offers oil settlement w/ #Yuan or #Gold or pegs International Yuan @ unit of gold, then oil will get more expensive if pay w/ naked USD or Euros. #PetroGold restart will take away some supply for straight currency pay. Watching. #OOTT

682 2018-05-07 22:30:09 Most of the gain is oil or oil related which is great. But the $15 a week extra in my check now goes to the $20 extra a week I pay for gas. Wasn’t the $8billion Exxon tax break supposed to trickle down?
683 2018-05-07 22:30:02 Yes, we were. Thank you for acknowledging that fact and agreeing to be silent. Admitting you're the problem is the first step to becoming the solution.
684 2018-05-07 22:30:02 Fair enough. But, if you don't bring something productive to the table, I can choose to mute you.
685 2018-05-07 22:29:57 It doesn't matter who is selling the snake oil, the rubes will line up to buy again and again...
686 2018-05-07 22:29:51 LMAO it's literally just half a teaspoon of oil  you're mad dramatic. I prefer using butter though
687 2018-05-07 22:29:39 I am saddened by it. Why do we need to separate life skills, social skills or character traits by gender? All children can learn the same life skills, whether that's baking a pie from scratch or changing the oil on a vehicle. Being a girl or a boy doesn't change their capability.

698 2018-05-07 22:27:51 Russia & Iran get to profit from the hike in oil prices,
while MAGATs pay for it at the pumps with the cost of gas, transportation, consumer prices, etc...
The price of oil is expected to rise if this fool pulls the U.S. out. Oil closed over $70/barrel, the highest since 2014.

711 2018-05-07 22:25:13 Crude oil at $70/barrel or higher means that a lot more deep water oil production & other very marginal production is economic again. Expect a large increase in oil supply if prices stay here for awhile. @dlacalle_IA
712 2018-05-07 22:25:12 and it funds oil drilling in the Amazon rainforest! #EndAmazonCrude

716 2018-05-07 22:24:29 Please don't invade Iran just because they trade oil in Euros instead of Dollars.  Keeping a strangle hold on the Petro-Dollar is NOT worth U.S. soldiers' blood.

718 2018-05-07 22:24:22 @realDonaldTrump Please Mr. President do something with these insane gas prices. Let's use our oil and stop bothering with foreign oil. Also keep our oil here!!!!! Look at Pennsylvania with the insane gas tax. Ever see someone call out of work because they can't afford gas?
719 2018-05-07 22:24:22 Getting a tire rotation and an oil change makes me real sad

721 2018-05-07 22:23:56 @EwinRacing any idea on the points to oil? I have the champion series chair, about a year old and starting to squeek.
722 2018-05-07 22:23:46 So let’s see.  Venezuela. Iran.  Big oil producing countries.  Wonder who benefits from less competition. Gazprom maybe?

727 2018-05-07 22:23:15 Politics doesn’t work like that! Trump hates Obama but hate is never enough to make such important decisions! 
The regime is already on the verge of collapse, cancelling the deal and bringing back serious oil and central bank sanctions will be the end of mullahs this time.

731 2018-05-07 22:22:50 The “Security Services” whom James is contracting for, don’t work for “us” - the U.K. public. They work for powerful vested oil, arms, corporate & banking interests. That’s what senior generals & admirals mean when they say “projecting Britain’s power abroad”.
732 2018-05-07 22:22:43 Taiwan airlines will increase their fuel surcharge on international flights with effect from today, due to surging international oil prices.

740 2018-05-07 22:21:46 Yeah, and I'm old enough to remember who got the fighter plane parts the drugs paid for - the Iranians. They must have a hell of a lot of oil they're not willing to let the 7 sisters liberate - they've been evil for decades. Since I was a lad.

And you can dig under it? Again, sapper defenses very common in castle walls.

794 2018-05-07 22:16:03 President of @Nestle Peter Brabeck says water is not a human right. Nestle is also destroying the rainforests for palm oil. How can you call @Starbucks a Seattle Co and partner with this company. I feel nothing but shame for the 3 bags of Sumatra in my cupboard.
795 2018-05-07 22:15:53 Perhaps my American friends can help answer this question for me - how does #ScottPruitt still have a job? Can't they find someone else to kowtow to Big Oil, defile your country, etc. that can keep a low profile?

802 2018-05-07 22:15:15 You are more clever than that. The oil companies are rorting the consumer by manipulating prices to maintain profits. And only us consumer s can address that - the governments are toothless.
803 2018-05-07 22:15:13 Gun violence is a epidemic, and No  more guns won't solve the issue, that's like saying we should just throw more oil Into a fire.
804 2018-05-07 22:15:10 If Iran can't sell their substantial amount of oil then the price of oil goes up. It's common fucking sense.

Was told they may be out Saturday afternoon--didn't show, waited all day Sunday--no one showed, was told via FB messenger they would be here today--didn't show.  How do I find out when they are coming--
813 2018-05-07 22:14:12 Interesting point @RealDavidJensen  but I don't see how oil can reprice 40%. China may be a factor but likely in tandem with others, eg: the Iran "no-deal" scare that started the move, Russia sanctions, Syria escalation, etc. The drop in DM growth has exposed long oil speculators

817 2018-05-07 22:13:41 yeah let's install the opposition so they can....not do anything abt global oil prices which are the fundamental cause of VZ economic problems and just cut a bunch of social programs, that's a good idea

819 2018-05-07 22:13:38 Matt's engaging in rhetorical games, he's not actually interested in conveying useful information. That's why he cherry picks Norway, a large oil state, and says 'see socialism!' I picked Saudi Arabia, because the point is that he's actually just saying 'having oil is great'.
820 2018-05-07 22:13:18 I feel we should tap into our oil wells in Texas , Wyoming,and other wells across our nation.

838 2018-05-07 22:11:28 Yes!

862 2018-05-07 22:08:06 @OfficialSGIUSA @ChantSpace As I arrived at Firestone the manager said he tried calling me saying a technician called out. The oil change could not be done today. It got moved to Tuesday, This time I will not be charged. No card statement for two months. No problem. #actualproof
863 2018-05-07 22:08:05 Sige sigeeee dadala ako oil
864 2018-05-07 22:08:04 Yes, demand for oil Globally is Growing it’s all Harper’s fault . Talk about looney toons
865 2018-05-07 22:07:50 I think the emu oil has seeped into the ole brain there. #bebetter
866 2018-05-07 22:07:48 Anselica: As you wish~

*Anselica place the staff standing up on the floor then she takes off all her clothes and rubs oil on herself she grabs the staff and move her oiled naked body up and down on the staff*
867 2018-05-07 22:07:44 They don't like being shown where they are wrong.
868 2018-05-07 22:07:43 Explain please what you mean by immoral laws? I am anti drugs so you are not going to sell me on the cannabis - however cannabis oil for medicinal purposes is a different matter. I see the change in immorality right there - one is medicinal the other recreational -one is a need.
869 2018-05-07 22:07:37 Thanks dude, we'll all be in suspense.
Could you do us a favor and first ask, "Is this for country, oil, or ego?"
870 2018-05-07 22:07:32 Ayooo it was so hot in my house my coconut oil turned into liquid 
871 2018-05-07 22:07:15 america and europe: man oil is getting kinda hard to come by!
northern europe: better start researching renewable energy alternatives!
america & southern europe: (eyeing the middle east) ..............uh huh.......
872 2018-05-07 22:07:11 Its so hot my coconut oil melted before i got home
873 2018-05-07 22:07:10 Ur head get oil
874 2018-05-07 22:06:57 @RitaSofiale or your best olive oil
875 2018-05-07 22:06:54 I can't believe I might live long enough to watch humanity deplete the earth of all of it's oil.

It scares the shit out of me.
876 2018-05-07 22:06:40 BREAKING: Beard oil shortage hits Kelowna.

885 2018-05-07 22:05:34 I think the main reason why alot of Nigerians pray for good health,  believe prophetic declarations ,  use anointing oil,  holy water etc. 

In abroad,  they are few prayers because the health sector is more than capable and responsible to the least person.
886 2018-05-07 22:05:27 Probably a paid troll.
887 2018-05-07 22:05:25 Is it just me, or does anyone else think #Trump is threatening to kill the #IranNuclearDeal to keep oil prices high and justify more military spending (thus serving his friends in big business within these industries, and helping out #Russia)? Just a thought...
888 2018-05-07 22:05:22 Grab that Kick Ass Immune System from natural grocers, Whole Foods, or sprouts, Oregano Oil in vitamin from is good too but in moderation and Deep Lung from wish garden is good for coughs n shit some don’t taste great but they work 10x faster, stay away from that other shit 
889 2018-05-07 22:05:22 Sometimes I put coconut oil on my hands/arms while I'm waiting for something to cook in the kitchen. #noshame
890 2018-05-07 22:05:06 If Trump decided to impose harsher sanction on Iran, which is one the largest oil producer, it could lead to an oil supply squeeze and potentially push prices even higher.
891 2018-05-07 22:04:58 Ya hay pruebas de que macri y sus amiguitos estaban operando la empresa Trafigura para comprar Oil Combustibles. la petrolera de Cristóbal López, Oil Combustibles

Bhá. Es lo mismo
892 2018-05-07 22:04:54 Thugs come in all colors, ask anyone who has ever worked law enforcement or corrections. Hip hop is a genre enjoyed by many colors as well. And there are many whites who have self-loathing. Your argument is invalid.
893 2018-05-07 22:04:38 "pastor" Darrell Scott is just Brian Pumper with canola oil .
894 2018-05-07 22:04:09 We do have corruption in USA , but compare to Iran, China or Russia is very small.
In Iran total corruption. $1.6 trillion stolen by the top leaders in past 40 years. 20% of oil revenues.
895 2018-05-07 22:04:04 Need some oil on dem cheeks lol but ok honey i see the lil cheeks 
896 2018-05-07 22:03:57 I like real lavender essential oil but anything "lavender scented" is nasty
897 2018-05-07 22:03:51 It doesn’t smell great but it nourishes tf out of your hair. Eggs moisturize and conditions, olive oil strengthens and adds shine, mayo promotes hair growth, and avocado also conditions, repairs and moisturizes.
898 2018-05-07 22:03:22 This guy at Jimmy jazz made a very good point about shoe releases yesterday. To make a long story short he said shoes are no longer selling out anymore so now Nike, Jordan etc is only giving out limited amount of shoes to maximize profits an to bring the hype back again.
899 2018-05-07 22:03:17 I know this dumb but since this a powder can I use this use I’m dark skinned? Or just put oil or lotion on after
900 2018-05-07 22:03:12 With the exception of oil (which is being reduced), nat gas and corn. The market really isn’t long commods basis positioning data. This completely flies in the face of ‘everyone is wildly bullish commodities’ narrative that is being pushed by some
901 2018-05-07 22:03:10 tree tea oil made my skin so dry ugh i'm sad now!
902 2018-05-07 22:03:08 i’ve been using a mascara w/cannabis oil and i made my mom try it today and she swore she was high for a bit today
903 2018-05-07 22:03:06 Just ordered my body shimmer oil from @KrazyEssentials! I’m Excited 
904 2018-05-07 22:02:57 @BraveTart I’m thinking about making hostess style cupcakes. In the intro it says your cupcakes start with safflower oil. I’m seeing coconut oil in the recipe, but no safflower oil. 

905 2018-05-07 22:02:43 Don’t forget about the oil. Prices go up and they all get richer.

917 2018-05-07 22:01:35 I used olive oil as the fat everywher
918 2018-05-07 22:01:34 Typical of many leftists. They don't like to entertain debating alternate views.
919 2018-05-07 22:01:32 I'm so glad I never needed an oil change.
920 2018-05-07 22:00:53 Lion oil is the same thing spelled backwards
921 2018-05-07 22:00:52 Mr deputy, should president Maduro get really scared -like Assad- and step down allowing then for the Venezuelan Miami-based Oligarchy that you support to hold gód elections, what wòuld you do with their world's biggest Oil reserve?

929 2018-05-07 21:59:27 Oil cruises past 74 dollars per barrel and no one is complaining again 
930 2018-05-07 21:59:07 Check out this delicious summer salad. Cucumber, fresh tomato, avocado, olive oil and sea salt. Delicious. Put that with a Trader Joe’s chicken burger and cauliflower mash!  What a great meal!  Cook at home!
931 2018-05-07 21:59:03 Giving 10B cheque to Texas oilmen is a sweetheart deal but I don't do welfare payments to oil execs who leave us the risk.
932 2018-05-07 21:58:59 Considering that @CPAC #CPAC2018 Chaired by SNAKE Oil SALESMAN @mschlapp would Ban Pro-Family group & PROMOTE an LGBTQ Activist they're JUST Profiteering off the angst of #Conservative folks ... so obviously the jailbreak crowd is BIDDING higher than anyone else for their favors
933 2018-05-07 21:58:57 I decided to actually eat tonight bc I purged my lunch & I can't keep giving in to my ED so I'm baking eggplant with vinegar, sesame oil, pepper, herb salt, & oregano
934 2018-05-07 21:58:45 I'm rooting for ya too BTW.  It pretty much is set the deal is dead, thing is I don't there will be many sanctions though.  If any are added, other countries will make the difference.  No supply disruption, and you got oil about $10 overvalued based on US dollar and S&P
935 2018-05-07 21:58:22 ...it’s perhaps not as urgent as in the case of #Iraq, needing substantial foreign investment in the #oil sector following the war (#petrochemical, #refining etc).

Perhaps once the investment requirements become urgent in 
#Iran too, the contracts will become attractive enough?
936 2018-05-07 21:58:20 A plant based diet without plant based oil (except olive) and high glicemic carbs could be highly healthy, right? Even reaching the protein paleo parameters that seems that you look in a diet. I read your article looking for a reason to eat meat and I couldn't find it.
937 2018-05-07 21:58:20 Need help. Anyone know what's the best product to use for burnt skin on the face? I've used aloe vera, rosehip oil and vitamin e too but no luck

942 2018-05-07 21:57:41 Me too, that one just couldn't get going, & then with the close today under 20sma, I dropped it from watch. Toppy candles throughout oil patch today.
943 2018-05-07 21:57:29 Just throw some oil on a skillet and lay the strips flat
944 2018-05-07 21:57:23 Girl....I got some coconut oil for your scalp but you deh far. Nah lie....meeda Netflix and pull out them braids.
945 2018-05-07 21:57:22 He blocked me after that last comment. Guess he couldn't handle the truth.
946 2018-05-07 21:57:17 I used to be so self conscious of my stretch marks but now I just don't care. If only bio oil worked for me, that would have been great 
947 2018-05-07 21:57:08 Dry shampoo. Even if you don’t “need” it for oil. Also I love the Living Proof Full Dry Volume Blast product which you spray in your roots

960 2018-05-07 21:55:26 Coconut oil is a white solid at room temperature, only melting when heated. Today, at room temperature, in an empty kitchen, window open, oven and all heating off, and it's a clear colourless liquid.
961 2018-05-07 21:55:22 Who puts olive oil in the fridge ???
962 2018-05-07 21:55:20 It won’t be prosperous for long, not when the feds bribe private businesses with taxpayers money.

981 2018-05-07 21:51:49 I'm not saying it isn't ecological, I'm saying you're reading gross implications from "equitable allocation of resources", like I'm out to drill all the oil and then hand it out evenly. Me repeating my point isn't going to get you off your edgelord anprim shit
982 2018-05-07 21:51:31 You could do burnouts on the oil spills

986 2018-05-07 21:51:10 In October 2017, oil was $50 as articles started to be released re. the spring startup of China's PetroYuan/Gold trade. Now #Oil is $70/bbl. Pondering if part of run is forward looking repricing of oil for USD / Euro in competition with China's settlement options. #OOTT

991 2018-05-07 21:50:44 Interesting piece,checkout the ever increasing Oil Price,$75 a barrel today,Money used to be the root of all EVIL,OIL has surpassed it.
992 2018-05-07 21:50:43 You might be able to find something similar buried on a government website if your sites have been surveyed for something that makes money. Maybe oil and gas quadrat maps? Wind resource maps?
993 2018-05-07 21:50:33 They probably use undiluted tea tree oil and wonder why it burns their face
994 2018-05-07 21:50:31 The reality is just starting to hit US. There is no way out of medical bills and student debt. And, oil just hit $70 a barrel.
995 2018-05-07 21:50:26 Oil combustibles que quede para el estado, me parece lo correcto
996 2018-05-07 21:50:18 @TylerFlorence I love the episode that aired recently, with you and @inagarten making fried chicken with peanut oil and fresh herbs (Rosemary etc...). . The best!! Wow!  Thanks again!
997 2018-05-07 21:50:10 Ah, I see. That's why I couldn't see what you're responding to. The coward blocked me. He obviously can't argue facts, so he hides.
998 2018-05-07 21:50:03 Oil price looking good for #pmg Over 76
999 2018-05-07 21:49:57 U.S. sanctions will likely only remove 300,000 to 500,000 barrels per day of Iranian oil off the market, compared with the 1 million to 1.5 million barrels the Obama administration curtailed.

1002 2018-05-07 21:49:25 The only reason, I hope, SCOTUS said in Miller (1939) was that there was no one to point out that "sawed-off" shotguns were used in the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, and The Great War.
1003 2018-05-07 21:49:19 It also raises the price of Oil which is a pretty big deal for the Russians right about now

1006 2018-05-07 21:49:11 My mom and I give one of our cats mineral oil to help with his constipation (he’s got an enlarged colon) so if that’s an option for you you can try that out as well! It works for him! Good vibes to you and yours! 
1007 2018-05-07 21:49:07 It was a few days ago, but I meant to ask, why did we have a full page feature in the Vancouver Province on the Edmonton Oil Kings WHL Bantam draft picks? Some of the picks were from this area, but that would be true of any WHL club.#puzzled
1008 2018-05-07 21:48:55 And import their oil - just like eastern Canada - from countries with no environmental plan - but Mikey doesn’t care.

1012 2018-05-07 21:48:21 Hey Donald, Do you like that your poll numbers are up? Do you want the stock market to stay strong? Do want stable oil prices & affordable gasoline for Americans? Do you want a good deal with North Korea? If the answers are YES, don't fuck with the Iranian nuclear deal. Be smart.
1013 2018-05-07 21:47:34 Would be interesting to know who and how much oil stocks have been bought traded the last few days.....
1014 2018-05-07 21:47:24 I will say this tho as much as I hate coconut my mom used coconut oil for her cornbread.... whole other level got unlocked
1015 2018-05-07 21:47:06 That would be a Saudi sheik... using his riches from oil we suck up.
1016 2018-05-07 21:47:01 If Kelly Armstrong is so “in” with the oil field community and its workers, why didn’t he use actual oil field workers in his ad?  Why are his coworkers Ashley Hurlbert and Markus Powell playing them?

1021 2018-05-07 21:46:42 If #Trump pulls out of #Irandeal, sanctions will be reimposed. And let's face it-that's exactly what he plans to do.  Iran's oil output will be hindered and the price of oil per barrel will rise. As a result, the cost of U.S. gas will escalate hurting consumers. 
1022 2018-05-07 21:46:41 You can't be on twitter talking about how much you need a woman in your life, but you're out there cringing when cringing when you hear words like "menstruation". That's like wanting a car but refusing to accept that oil change is a thing

1025 2018-05-07 21:46:36 The right of self-determination is a Kurdish right & any nation who seeks independence, but that's not enough. First build your state then announce it, Barzani wanted to announce it then build it, & he wanted impose himself & further loot the oil not seeking independence.

1035 2018-05-07 21:45:13 Well I’m kinda behind this. I’d like to see us use solar power more and oil less.
1036 2018-05-07 21:45:01 I do not put the blames only on Baghdad for our issues with Baghdad. The best days of the Kurds in iraq has been b/n 2003-2013 be4 KRG PM exporting oil independently, Barzani & Al-Maliki made issues complicated. All Baghdad-Erbil issues can be resolved.

1052 2018-05-07 21:42:33 In spite of US-instigated Western sanctions and low oil prices, Russia's economy continues to be vibrant and growing. For all of last year, it's GNP grew by 1.5 percent, while it recorded at 115 billion dollar trade surplus.
1053 2018-05-07 21:42:28 If you can swing it and carry it...
1054 2018-05-07 21:42:25 Don't pull out because the deal was done on Obama's watch. The price of oil will go up and our allies will be left holding the bag. Iran says they will not abide by a new agreement.
1055 2018-05-07 21:42:23 $150 Oil is great if you have a tanker full

1057 2018-05-07 21:42:15 Having a Land Rover is GREAT until you have to pay $2000 for an oil change and break pads 
1058 2018-05-07 21:41:53 Not sure that's unintended. Russian oil oligarchs need higher oil prices.
1059 2018-05-07 21:41:51 But if you increase fuel efficiency, people won't need to refuel as often, and oil companies won't make as much money. I'm sure Mango Mussolini and his donors will fight to protect their stranglehold on us.

1062 2018-05-07 21:41:40 True Ezinne, but when the crude oil was 100 USD, our currency was stronger because we could defend d naira. When the crude oil price crashed, the value of the naira depreciated significantly, hence, it will reflect in our import, as petrol is our number 1 import. Is it clear now?
1063 2018-05-07 21:41:38 I wish I could smoke more than the ocassional sneak one in between drug tests. We'll have access in 2019 to THC oil but no more than 5% content.

1066 2018-05-07 21:40:48 Truffle oil is such an addicting flavor. I want it on everything.
1067 2018-05-07 21:40:43 The point is neither Norway, Sweden, Denmark, or Finland are remotely socialist. Norway discovered oil and Matt is using that to mislead people as to the actual system of government, which is based on private markets and private property.
1068 2018-05-07 21:40:38 Love it! Hate to always think of commercialising everything, but there'd be a market for oil paintings of planets, IMO.
1069 2018-05-07 21:40:36 In the same way as coal, the Oil Sands is NOT the direction for energy that Canada should take!     You must stop equating Energy with Oil.

1077 2018-05-07 21:39:10 #USA unlikely to totally back out of #Iran deal, as this would drive Iran into #China arms, as China would keep buying their #oil. #Trump would see that as a bad deal, probably be continued negotiation> remove sunset clause (#political cynicism by #Obama, kicking can down road).
1078 2018-05-07 21:39:07 Also some have been bought with oil, I was witness to that sort of deals in the past.
1079 2018-05-07 21:38:52 Uttering threats should never be condoned. But it's not just Kinder Morgan tanks these people are protesting; there are Shell oil storage tanks behind the trees. Adding another 14 oil storage tanks in KM property puts 10000s people under massive fire risk

1086 2018-05-07 21:37:49 I believe the long standing rumour that Australia has its own oil reserves, capped wells they are just sitting on, if so then it is high time to uncap them and tell the middle east to go hump it's self. too long they have been holding us to ransom
1087 2018-05-07 21:37:48 Unintended consequence of Trump pulling out of the Iran Nuclear Deal? The price of crude oil will rise which in turn will cause gas prices to rise.

Is this because the USA is now a net oil exporter or you really fear the bomb from theran?
Constructive criticism
1097 2018-05-07 21:36:34 The "3rd world countries" where oil & other resource extraction  we refer to when discussing impacting women are Canada & the U.S. Where temp. "man camp's are set up.

A number of murderers/rapists/abusers come out of those'man camp's' & they contribute significantly to MMIWG.

1103 2018-05-07 21:35:45 Good but have a good think about it before... what’s in it for you if you throw a tantrum?

1107 2018-05-07 21:35:06 It was oil price not policy
1108 2018-05-07 21:34:58 I guess we can prepare for crude oil to jump above $100
1109 2018-05-07 21:34:47 So let's see the Liberals have worked hard at crippling the oil and gas industry just before the Iranian nuclear deal goes bye bye pushing price per barrel upward. Let's project 6 months down the road we won't be able to afford to fill our cars/furnaces - Thanks Liberals #cdnpoli
1110 2018-05-07 21:34:45 No it's not textbook witch hunt.  You should look up the actual definition instead of falling for trump's hype, but then, a snake oil salesman always counts on people to ignore the truth and fall for their lies.

1126 2018-05-07 21:33:18 My point is that Norway owns a lot of assets because it has oil. So does Saudi Arabia. It's sleight of hand as analysis.
1127 2018-05-07 21:33:17 That oil show will break it again.

1134 2018-05-07 21:31:32 Trump to announce Iran deal decision by 2pm Tuesday ahead of May 12 deadline. Statement caused oil prices to slide.
1135 2018-05-07 21:31:08 "Dear enemy, we declare war on you. Prepare to be destroyed by pur awesome force. PS please don't shoot at our female soldiers as they might get upset."
1136 2018-05-07 21:31:07 Build 19 more refineries.  Lower the cost of 1.70 litres of gas lower across Canada.

Start Canadian oil companies instead of relying on foreign owned companies keeping profits in foreign countries.
1137 2018-05-07 21:31:03 Oil already hit $70 a barrel. That is what THIS is all about. Fools.
1138 2018-05-07 21:30:56 The oil
1139 2018-05-07 21:30:55 You're 100% correct. Nothing will happen to Iran's oil. This stupid "OMG Iran Deal uncertainty" stupidity will do nothing to oil supply and demand. Trump may just resort to word salad to trick his stupid white racist followers.

1153 2018-05-07 21:30:04 I hate olive oil so much... 
I don't care how benifical it is..

1168 2018-05-07 21:28:29 yes.. midterms are a few months away and higher oil prices means makes it much easier for democrats to grab the house and impeach him ..the deal will be intact..there will be a lot of word salad from Trump's mouth to make it seem he won..but Iran will still be able to export oil

1180 2018-05-07 21:27:10 It's  been a practice that former Sec of State keep in touch with former foreign dignitaries.  At this point most in the world do not want to screw up the iran deal, by Trump pulling us out.  Why does he not pay attention. If we pull out oil prices will skyrocket.
1181 2018-05-07 21:26:50 The up side of four hours sitting at Canadian Tire while the wheel bearing was replaced (and oil change, and snow tyres off, and annual safety) was that I read the entirety of @writer_anthony's Empire of Ashes and didn't even stir abroad in search of tea. A gripping conclusion!
1182 2018-05-07 21:26:49 @michamber can you explain why your PAC paying for the attack on independent redistricting in Michigan is funded by Enbridge, the Canadian oil company that runs Line 5 in the great lakes? Can you explain taking foreign dark money to hurt the citizens s of this state?
1183 2018-05-07 21:26:16 Not after a few more years. Oil is depleting, and research says in about 2050, all the oil supply in the world might be gone for good.

Wait till these "conspirators" in 2060 make conspiracies about electricity or any other renewable energy source saying the same stuff.

1211 2018-05-07 21:22:30 Do you know anything about the economy?  We are in for a record breaking recession.  Your #GOPTaxScam is job killing.  And when we exit the Iran deal, oil prices will spike and the cost of gas will skyrocket.  Perhaps you should just keep your mouth shut. #DitchMitch
1212 2018-05-07 21:22:28 I have already. When you start accusing me of lying in a convo where I haven't that merely undermines your own credibility. I don't have to argue with you. So I won't.
1213 2018-05-07 21:22:25 Okay, folks this is why Trump was put into office--to raise oil prices!!  Oligarchy is trying to control the world's resources and the derivative markets.  Banks and oil firms invest in oil funded by loans.  They expect big $$ on their investment.  Global instability is key!

1215 2018-05-07 21:22:06 There are 9 refineries in Alberta.  Who is going to invest in new ones? Oil companies are fleeing Canada and going places where it is easier to invest. Also, who are we selling final product to? Can't get a pipeline built.

1283 2018-05-07 21:13:57 And drive oil to 85 bucks...
1284 2018-05-07 21:13:46 Stop using oil then. Oh wait, you wont. So why not get it from within Canada?

"The deal is still on blah blah blah."
"Terrible deal, blah blah blah."
"It's not final, but we're extending agreement blah blah blah."

1288 2018-05-07 21:12:29 Trump attacks Iran to run up oil value. Sounds familiar, George W. Bush managed to raise oil to over 145 dollars a barrel, by continued attacks on Iran.

For your sinuses and lungs: take steamy showers, drink hot beverages, and use a humidifier. It loosens up your

What do Liberals know about integrity? Absolutely nothing! The same as you know nothing about what Canadians want and need! What we don't want or need is you and your carbon tax, oil pipeline, job killing policies so you and your pals can enrich themselves!  #RESIGN
1297 2018-05-07 21:11:19 Fair point, but d price modulation template shared, petrol was just under 145, however, crude oil was about USD34 at d time. As crude oil price rebound, so also the price of petrol. The truth is politics is too important dat if govt didn't cover the difference, political suicide.
1298 2018-05-07 21:11:15 Imagine how there’s always good food on an oil rig than on land... 
1299 2018-05-07 21:11:11 -the oil around on her skin, giving it a bit of gloss in the sun. He made sure to rub it in deep, as his hands even moved in which only a masseur could perform, which would work out a couple of kinks in her back, both in her muscles, and in her spine, as a few pops happened.*
1300 2018-05-07 21:10:54 Yeah, Oil is OVER 70 bucks BUT VLAD is delighted!!!

Gas gonna be over $3 all summer and trump dolts don’t even realize its donnie fkn ‘em

1308 2018-05-07 21:09:48 Then who’s gonna change your oil
1309 2018-05-07 21:09:47 If these loans were based on the quality of Saudi Arabian footballers I would gladly welcome them to European football. Thats clearly not the case. They`re a part of some lugubrious oil money strategy.
1310 2018-05-07 21:09:47 No I don't. I have tried toners in the past they mainly strip the oil from your skin. And my skin dry mainly especially on my chin and then I end up getting dry flaky patches.
1311 2018-05-07 21:09:34 Was it packed in oil? Because mine will only eat the salmon packed in spring water. 
1312 2018-05-07 21:09:33 Thank you EK for taking the time to provide your expertise.  Oil is a challenging sector as are all commodities.  It's simply amazing how you navigate all the turns - I haven't read anyone on twitter yet who does what you do.
1313 2018-05-07 21:09:29 Happens to me when I work. The smell of oil fills my nose so I don’t want to eat anything, but I know I haven’t eaten in 10 hours so I’m hungry and need to eat, I just don’t feel it.
1314 2018-05-07 21:09:12 It's not a game show. You cheapen the office of the presidency every time you use your twitter account like a tv commercial for United States foreign policy. You're best suited for a circus job, somewhere where the snake oil sales are brisk and the intellectual high bar is low.
1315 2018-05-07 21:09:09 It was actually really warm today and sunny so Owen and I ran errands and I wore a PINAFORE and put tanning oil on my arms and legs, hoping I’d be able to get a tan and?????? No?????? Owen had to buy sunblock bc his white ass skin was starting to burn and mcwhiteys
1316 2018-05-07 21:09:08 But look at the membership of the Labour Party. More than three times what it was. My first choice was not Jeremy but I believe he is an honourable man. We don't need another snake oil salesman.

1323 2018-05-07 21:08:49 I think folk from the Islands relied heavily on eating fat from seabirds and fish livers. Shetlanders used to pour cod liver oil on their mashed potatoes. They seem to have needed the nutrients, maybe there's a lot of Vitamin D?

In 2017 Parsley's production increased 77.5% YOY.  Now on-track for 55% YOY production growth in 2018. Also, have needed pipeline capacity to increase movement of oil from the Permian to markets.
1329 2018-05-07 21:08:07 Nope not usually. I’m semi fat adapted and eat in the morning to fuel more than for hunger.  I used to drink coffee/coconut oil in the am and that would last til hunger around lunch. Upping the sleep hours could be an option too.

1343 2018-05-07 21:06:05 Alberta has the highest employment rate in the country...by a long shot. For all demographic groups. The rate has dropped most for young men, but that’s because they worked in sectors that got hit hardest by the oil price collapse. He’s distorting and cherrypicking the stats.
1344 2018-05-07 21:06:02 Have you tried argan oil?? It's really good at smoothing and mending split ends
1345 2018-05-07 21:05:58 We could quote the same authors in context to set you straight. The right to use arms for self defense, or hunting, rests in the 9th & 10th amendment & in the right of a law abiding citizen to defend ones person. Not the second amendment.
1346 2018-05-07 21:05:39 That’s one shiny oil tank.
1347 2018-05-07 21:05:38 Tea tree oil literally diminished my blemishes, but packing it to go on trips is the worst. No matter what I do or how carefully I pack it-- put it in a container, wrap it in a bag, etc.-- it ALWAYS gets all over my things. It just ruined one of my canvas bag.
1348 2018-05-07 21:05:31 I'm sure the oil industry will be fine, just not #Canada's. I am more concerned about what the upstream and downstream cost of the #CO2 tax will be to my family. #cdnpoli

1351 2018-05-07 21:05:17 3 They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:
1352 2018-05-07 21:05:12 Oil prices are sensitive in the US.. after a certain threshold..pain sets in for the average American...McCain was doomed against Obame when oil prices hit $4+ in 2007. Trump knows that..that's why his first tweet attacking OPEC against their jawboning was revealing.
1353 2018-05-07 21:05:02 4 But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
1354 2018-05-07 21:04:52 The same guys that gave me my last oil change are here and last time one of the guys was sad because this girl he liked was sending mixed signals and today he has a hicky yay for true love

1407 2018-05-07 20:58:48 The price of oil above 70$ is good for oil exporting countries. Especially Ghana  and Nigeria 
1408 2018-05-07 20:58:32 I hate you OI really do/ You bad blood people leave it to me, your Dad and sister to feed them monsters. All over the world I am fine. Ireland and UK I am dinner for them . The trick is Tea Tree OIl the good stuff. It scares the away and stops the itch if you forget which I do
1409 2018-05-07 20:58:26 This is like a oil spill.  45 now says you can’t sue the oil co who caused the spill for damages.  I don’t think so!!!
1410 2018-05-07 20:58:22 ah, arugula salad is excellent with mandarin oranges, roasted walnut pieces, and a bit of salt, oil and either vinegar or lemon, not overdone. You might like it then :)

Also, have fun dumping a quart of oil in every 500 miles for no reason other than it's an Audi.

1414 2018-05-07 20:58:10 they've been needing to lure Qatari oil tycoons as owners for years now unsuccessfully

1417 2018-05-07 20:57:46 Media trump just tweeted to his friends buy oil stocks before 2pm tomorrow. It was no accident he tweeted what time he was going to announce the Iranian deal.

1419 2018-05-07 20:57:35 The worst thing u can do is get your oil changed at this time of day
1420 2018-05-07 20:57:32 Depends if you pre heat the oil. Probably super fast and dangerous pop-splosion
1421 2018-05-07 20:57:29 Palm oil:
-Rich in vitamin E
-promotes cell growth in hair follicles, makes your hair STRONGER
-prevents hair loss
-prevents hair discoloration
-moisturizes your scalp
-removes oils (yes oils can dissolve oils)
-eliminates parasites
1422 2018-05-07 20:57:25 Forces ready: US/Israel/Saudi vs Iran/Iraq/ Lebanon-Hesballah, Syria, Yemen. If US attacks Iran, Israel will attack Hesballah-Lebanon. Hesballah is the first line of defance vs Israel. Outcome not certain. Tactical nukes maybe used. Price of oil will go sky high. Gas price,$7-10.

1430 2018-05-07 20:56:39 I lived in Tehran for 5 months and Iranian people are the nicest people I've met .I do believe every Iranian would like regime change .But to say the USA are really genuine then you must be deluded..#oil
1431 2018-05-07 20:56:34 Castor oil definitely
1432 2018-05-07 20:56:23 That is correct. Of course that would tend to mean that any arms used by the militia would be protected; M16, M4, etc.. ;-)
1433 2018-05-07 20:56:14 Sessions is a slime. Every time they show his face he just looks like a grimy man with that smirk on his face.

1435 2018-05-07 20:56:00 I'm familiar with the text. I argue apples and you come back citing oranges.  The militia was intended to be an antidote to occupying police forces & multitrillion dollar DOD standing armies. I don't hear that in your text.
1436 2018-05-07 20:55:57 That’s a good point, maybe that’s why he pushed it ahead, either case he’s a moron and so are the oil bulls 
1437 2018-05-07 20:55:54 We agree...it is pretty awesome :)  It is a different concept not changing the oil, but it works!  The EXi engine is designed with an overhead valve engine and runs a lot cooler and does not burn up the oil as quickly.
1438 2018-05-07 20:55:53 And if he professes such strong philosophical ideals, why is he hiding?                      How about refusing to fight for oil barons to make more billions? or out of horror re civilian casualties? or until there's a lucid CINC? Some coherent concern. He's just an ass

1442 2018-05-07 20:55:04 The water woes are everywhere.  One fracked oil well can eat one million gallons of water!  We’re in Texas and most people had an increase in water costs.  We’re on lawn watering schedules IF you watered.  But oil companies could have as much as nweded.  We pay oil water cost!!!

1501 2018-05-07 20:50:09 Your plan will not work. Better to treat any GHG tax as 'value added' and not apply to exported oil and gas, but should hit imported oil. Would profit exports, create incentive for oil refining in Canada and impede continued import of one million bbl/day of oil.

As does deregulating oil & coal, getting record #s of Americans off welfare & back to work, securing the borders, increasing military spending, &meeting with Kim Jong Un.

One day, I was making burritos and I turned on the stove and did everything you need to make it. Then I went to flip over the burrito and the hot oil hit my hand and burned me and the food and the stove, the end.
1520 2018-05-07 20:48:18 Your quotes are all out of context and designed to confuse the subject.

1523 2018-05-07 20:47:49 Crackpots - crude oil is still cheaper than when gas $4+/gal. Then crude oil was over $100/barrel

1525 2018-05-07 20:47:35 I wonder if it occurred to any democrat that Obama's 8 yrs of his American lack of energy program via no Anwar drilling, no Dakota pipline, no offshore drilling, no coal production meant that we must continue to kiss the ass of MidEast mullahs who controlled our oil? #IranDeal
1526 2018-05-07 20:47:28 The real surprise is that it used no oil or coolant whatsoever, which isn't bad considering I didn't dawdle on the motorway.
1527 2018-05-07 20:47:27 No way, let us not forget that Alberta is now making next to nothing in profits for their oil because of pandering to mult-national assholes.

1529 2018-05-07 20:46:50 1.  they said their lamps were going out 
2.  they asked for others to give them oil 
3.  they were told to go and buy oil.
1530 2018-05-07 20:46:44 Getting an oil change is annoying. All these fucking questions 

“What’s your mileage?”
“Would you like a new air filter?”
“Synthetic or Conventional oil?”
“Did you know you have a leak?”
“Are you high right now?”
“Do you ever get nervous?”

1533 2018-05-07 20:46:31 Yes, the Green Party defeated Al Gore, the most environmentally conscious major party candidate in history and put an oil man in the White House. The Green Party motto “Helping elect Republicans since 2000”.

1536 2018-05-07 20:46:13 I’ve been in the sun all day with oil on and I still haven’t tanned. This is bullshit!!!
1537 2018-05-07 20:46:13 Exactly. Esp when Amazon has timed its Prime price increase, as it did in 2014, to oil being $70+/barrel. The assumption that there are no costs motivating Amazon to do this is weird. Prime has long been thought a loss leader for Amazon. Maybe they're cutting some of that loss.

1549 2018-05-07 20:44:28 yeah especially when you're eating 100% clean so just like, eggs, chicken breast, greens and ruffage, coconut oil etc. It's like, not a lot on paper but it's all sooooooo filling

1554 2018-05-07 20:44:04 Disagree, I think allowing the car and oil lobbies to make every single important infrastructure decision for the last century was pretty alpha
1555 2018-05-07 20:43:56 Of course Drew doesn't include the fact that the reason for that is many of those dropped out of school to make big oil money, and have no education or skills to find other work.
1556 2018-05-07 20:43:51 Bloody loooove slapping coconut oil all over ma face
1557 2018-05-07 20:43:49 .... Sen. McConnell, every 5th grader knows by now that "the ship of state is an oil tanker" and every time the rudder turns, it takes at least 5 years for the direction of the ship to change, .... why do you questions the intelligence of 300 million Americans, @BarakObama thanx

1566 2018-05-07 20:42:45 Actually, I had that in mind, too. But I don't think he will stay in. He will either pull out completely (very unlikely) or refuse to waive oil/CB sanctions to buy time for a side deal. 
So, he both wants to send Israel a gift ahead of embassy opening and announce it from WH.
1567 2018-05-07 20:42:33 Interesting. Wasn't aware that Brazil had figured out a way to make it work, though the net gains would also have to be compared to other possible crops. Unless fuel prices soar it is probably a better strategy to invest in other products and use the money to import/extract oil.
1568 2018-05-07 20:42:31 Or make families once they get there.

Also, resource wealth ≠ material wealth. E.g. Nigeria is drowning in oil yet average annual income is ~$6K. Compare to tiny, resourceless Luxembourg at 10 times that.

Expanse colonies are corporate-owned, yes? The money goes back to Earth.
1569 2018-05-07 20:42:25 There’s no one at the oil change place GOD BLESS
1570 2018-05-07 20:42:15 @realDonaldTrump Venezuela is in serious financial oil problem, because they has to pay ConocoPhillips $2,040 millions of dollars, and you has the opportunity to tell Maduro, that he must celebrate free and democratic election now, or I will not buy any more oil from you. Please.
1571 2018-05-07 20:42:14 Amen. Enough of this foo foo food. I saw a dude using truffle oil in burgers. This ain’t chopped, and I’m not trying to beat Bobby Flay. I just want a great burger!!
1572 2018-05-07 20:42:12 I always make the mistake of drowning myself with tanning oil and then ending up burning like fire
1573 2018-05-07 20:42:00 Same with running on things like the Grand Canyon train running on used cooking oil. Sadly it'll probably be too pricy for the commoner.
1574 2018-05-07 20:41:53 She didn't also ask for kolanuts, tubers of yam and palm oil? 
1575 2018-05-07 20:41:44 Of course! The peeps who got me my kit are so helpful I love sharing what I learn from them! Everyone’s oil journey is so different! It’s so fun to me 
1576 2018-05-07 20:41:42 I wish I had recorded the sounds that came out of my mouth when the cannons gave me a divine grace stone and a scared oil in the same day
1577 2018-05-07 20:41:40 I tweeted that 99% of oil traders do not know how oil traded.

Gabriel @GabrieL_iLiadis reacted by saying that 99% of people use money without caring to know what money is or it is created.

1580 2018-05-07 20:41:17 I'm pretty sure that I only dreamed I was out of olive oil.  But I am not confident enough to not by some more at the store.  Just in case.
1581 2018-05-07 20:40:47 With the constant rise in oil prices When the price of gas reaches $3.00 a gallon wonder what the  pickup truck  crowd in Trump country are thinking. Remember Pryor to 2017 gas price around $2,25 a gallon. Why will the blame Obama.
1582 2018-05-07 20:40:39 I do vividly remember speaking to him at Monza when he was really struggling with that turd of a Bimota and he told me: “To be honest, it’s f**kin’ hard to ride fast when you spend more time looking for f**kin’ oil leaks than you do looking where you are going!”

1586 2018-05-07 20:40:18 Well....they WOULD care if when oil drops the dollar drops with it....which if my thesis is correct that the dollar is now on the #OilStandard is exactly what will happen if China pulls the plug on the oil market

1609 2018-05-07 20:37:51 They're going to throw old, sick people out of the nursing homes. Rather than tax oil companies and businesses a few more dollars a year, the insane right-wing Republicans of Louisiana are throwing the old and sick out in the street.

1622 2018-05-07 20:36:11 A nice day, but stocks were well off their highs. The Dow closed up 95 off its early advance of 217. Oil was king today touching above $70 a bbl and both elevated and frightened the market. Oil stocks rallied then faded the rest rather neutral. Breadth both about 1.8 to 1.
1623 2018-05-07 20:36:04 Canada has pretty much no refineries.  Alberta could build refineries and create jobs that way.

Better than selling oil to a foreign country, refined there, jobs there, and Canada buying back the finished product of their own oil.

1657 2018-05-07 20:31:57 Sure - it’s the acid in the vinegar / lemon juice that breaks down the other ingredients. Could probably dress the orzo w/ a splash of olive oil to keep it from sticking
1658 2018-05-07 20:31:55 Since #Trump began saber rattling on #Iran, crude oil has gone up about $20 per barrel. This amounds to an extra $68 million per day in revenue to #Russia, or about $25 billion per year extra in an economy that is smaller than #SouthKorea's. #TrumpRussia #TrumpIran

1680 2018-05-07 20:28:33 100% right. Most voters care about how it affects them. Iran is a far off place that has no more meaning than any other word to them. If $2-3 something a gallon is lower oil prices they will for sure be pissed if it goes up
1681 2018-05-07 20:28:30 Just hardly one more decade.. the crude oil imports will go down to 70% due to usage of renewable sources of energy.. then'll see who is dog..
At least we've been smart n technically qualified since ancient times.. so we could survive. But how these barbaric Desert guys would 
1682 2018-05-07 20:28:24 The crisis of 1976 was the culmination of years of problems caused by Heath, Labour and the Oil Crisis. It was however, nowhere near as potentially disastrous as the global banking crisis that Brown faced.
1683 2018-05-07 20:28:09 Africa does not need foreign aid, if we had unity of purpose and resolve we could trade amongst ourselves and help every nation accordingly. Why should Zimbabwe import fuel from UAE when Angola has oil?
1684 2018-05-07 20:27:45 US oil prices top $70 a barrel for the first time since 2014

1688 2018-05-07 20:27:10 And with the wrong announcement the price of oil hit 100$ a barrel
1689 2018-05-07 20:27:04 Oil. Gas. Steel. Timber. Coal. To name just a few. Lots of ppl want that!
1690 2018-05-07 20:26:59 Me too! Crazy headaches and neckaches from tension! But I'm diffusing "stress away" essential oil and listening to "spa radio" in my office while I work - it does help even if it's not a full massage!!! #caregiversupportchat #caregiverhack
1691 2018-05-07 20:26:59 Okay wash your hair as little as possible, your natural oils will replenish anything that it needs and eventually your hair won't get so oily. Sulfate free shampoos are the best thing to use and y'all both probably need some kind of serum or oil to put in your long hair for
1692 2018-05-07 20:26:26 it pains me to do normie shit like change my oil
1693 2018-05-07 20:26:25 Bones dont turn to oil.

1696 2018-05-07 20:26:09 at this point im pretty sure there is more oil on my face than there is in the middle east
1697 2018-05-07 20:26:04 Nivea products ; normal and combination skin cleanser , toner and moisturizer, as well as castor oil .
1698 2018-05-07 20:26:00 Anybody wanna pay for my oil change? No, it’s ok I understand 
1699 2018-05-07 20:25:58 It can take a few weeks to retrain your hair to produce less oil. Also try showering on non shampoo days and only use conditioner or nothing but water?
1700 2018-05-07 20:25:57 I've been putting lavender oil on my clothes and in my hair and men won't leave me alone now lol

1703 2018-05-07 20:25:49 i just got an oil change and the dude told me next time to spray my car and not leave my weed or he’ll take it...we friends now haha

1714 2018-05-07 20:24:25 Server PSUs are super loud anyway, if it's squealing you could try adding a single drop of oil to the bearings?
1715 2018-05-07 20:24:21 Today I’ll treat myself to an oil change and a daq.
1716 2018-05-07 20:24:17 Guys Blackseed oil twice a day and hayfever ain't come back for me... Takes a week or so to get going
1717 2018-05-07 20:24:16 .@SenateCA At Social Affairs Cttee on cannabis bill #c-45 high potency THC products being discussed.  The highest potency products will not even be permitted for sale in Canada.  Just dried cannabis and oil. #cdnpoli
1718 2018-05-07 20:23:52 Yup. And those who pre-sell their output of next 2-5 years at $70, do not care if oil drops to $10.

@chigrl
1719 2018-05-07 20:23:46 he can but isn't allowed
cause Putin wants the oil price high 
(and sanctions low or lifted)
1720 2018-05-07 20:23:44 So is the plan to break the will of the island and it's inhabitants by ignoring their current desperate situation so they'll welcome any relief and 
pathetic wages from oil barrons?
1721 2018-05-07 20:23:33 Predicted outcome: Trump withdraws, nobody else does. US oil prices go up, nodody else affected.
1722 2018-05-07 20:23:19 What whiplash in oil this afternoon I thought we were finally getting the whoosh I was waiting for and everyone pulled out!
1723 2018-05-07 20:23:11 She is gonna poop vegetable oil.
1724 2018-05-07 20:22:47 this oil change sure turned into a lot more 
1725 2018-05-07 20:22:27 Haven't seen that. I just use the Stihl chain oil & 2 stroke oil.. a gallon is only $14.

1726 2018-05-07 20:22:23 It has nothing to do with oil.

The change hasn't benefited England in any way.

What utter nonsense.
1727 2018-05-07 20:22:15 Housewives have great intuition. As a Louisiana oil patch baby, I believe you are spot-on that there is an large element of the uncertainty in the pricing, not just with the deal, but with their sabre rattling. At least the euro is going down -- good for Italian wine consumption!

1734 2018-05-07 20:21:20 Gas prices will go up and the US economy will sink not that your 30% base care.  Prices at the pump are likely to be 14% higher than last summer an average of $2.74 per gallon the US govt estimated. The price of oil has climbed because of efforts by OPEC and Russia/Trump  #resign

1739 2018-05-07 20:21:01 I love making steak on a nice skillet.

Take the steaks out to let them breathe and get to room temp. Skillet olive oil until it smokes.

Rub Himalayan salt and peppercorns on said steaks.

Pan sear both sides on high for 2 mins.

Turn heat to medium high. Add butter. (1/2)
1740 2018-05-07 20:20:56 I’m trying to perfect the art of washing only one hand, because I want the other hand to heal.  I have a blister on the finger of one hand (I think it’s a burn from when the frying pan was spraying bits of oil).  Every time I wash my hand, the bandaid comes loose.
1741 2018-05-07 20:20:46 You never want to buy your girlfriend or your wife an electric chainsaw because you never know if you cross the line they may come at you in the middle of the night and you'll never hear it coming  until it's too late! Ha! With or without oil or silicone... Monday wisdom.
1742 2018-05-07 20:20:41 Butter or coconut oil?
1743 2018-05-07 20:20:34 Heartbroken....Panko crumbs contain palm oil  #auspol
1744 2018-05-07 20:20:12 Thats good to hear! So 10 liters water saved per meter.  Good going.
What about the oil and chemicals in production though?  I'm a drag about this as I hate chemical pollution and oil corps getting rich, but hey, if people want synthetic then yours is a good option.
1745 2018-05-07 20:20:12 To distract myself from studying in true adult fashion I took my car to get gas, an oil change, and washed / detailed this afternoon 
1746 2018-05-07 20:20:12 Honestly Ms. Strong, I'd have a better chance of striking oil in my backyard...we can only dream...
1747 2018-05-07 20:20:11 Solid first round of the year shot +2 74 even with bogeying 16,17 and 18. I was LEAKIN oil coming in. Not a great finish but pretty satisfied

1749 2018-05-07 20:20:09 That video was a lake sinking into a salt mine shaft. They were prospecting for oil in Louisiana and misread the map of the lake and shafts. Oops. Drilling barge etc is now 3000’ underground. They explored the hole, it’s 6’ across and they went 566’ down  ....
1750 2018-05-07 20:20:09 Wym, just dont take the stairs you oil 
1751 2018-05-07 20:20:04 Embrace them. I know it's easier said than done but its the truth. Other than that, using Cocoa Butter (the pure, raw one), whipped with Helichrysum Oil + Coconut Oil helps reduce the appearance of it. I've started liking mine.
1752 2018-05-07 20:19:52 Me, the sun and oil do nottttt mix well  burnt to fuck
1753 2018-05-07 20:19:52 I know... I'm 35 and still love to run... yoga, lunges, and taking fish oil helps a lot.

1755 2018-05-07 20:19:28 Can't keep removing oil from the earth-sea and burn it into the atmosphere without consequences. Earth is heating up from the inner crust and from the outside.  Solution: Wind, Solar Electric vehicles: Time for the Industrial Age to End before it Ends us!
1756 2018-05-07 20:19:19 Anyone know why Gas prices are hiking when we manufacture so much damn oil?? Especially here in Texas... Weird.. Isn't it????

1759 2018-05-07 20:19:05 I changed my oil yesterday. It went great except when I attempted to recycle the used oil from my large oil receptacle. I hadn't emptied it in a couple years and was told it was contaminated so I have to call the city to find a i can take it. Ugh.

Olive oil from California or South Africa.
Oranges from Florida or Australia.
Cars from Japan or South Korea.
Cheese from the UK, Australia or NZ.
Wine from UK, NZ, Chile, Argentina, South Africa, California...

We don't have to rely on subsiding French producers.
1763 2018-05-07 20:18:33 you are pouring oil on the fire..

1769 2018-05-07 20:18:06 Try to cut down washing to like twice a week. Shampoo twice. Condition the ends. Conditioning is a big deal when you have long hair. If you find yourself getting crunchy and tangy, use a hair oil on your ends.
1770 2018-05-07 20:18:04 me: tries to sell car for truck

also me: backs into a tree, trashes my bumper then goes in for oil change and has almost 2,000 dollars added in repairs on brakes and battery

1773 2018-05-07 20:17:47 Impact of Iran Deal that matters most to American voters: 

Lower oil prices.
1774 2018-05-07 20:17:46 The tension over Iran sanctions is costing all of us at the pump! If we are exporting surplus oil 
Why do we have to suffer? Screw the commodity price!! What say ye @realDonaldTrump

1776 2018-05-07 20:17:35 Clove oil, "Eugenol" is the medicinal name. It's like Buckleys, tastes awful, but it works. Kills tooth pain instantly and lasts. Don't waste your money on the other junk. Take it from someone who has pulled his own teeth.

1779 2018-05-07 20:17:31 That was more a national joke we were all in on lol. There's a few controversies though, mostly the oil pipelines the west coast is fighting against the Feds on, and the Feds put through a benign gender rights bill that people took way out of context thanks to J.Peterson
1780 2018-05-07 20:17:29 I am aware of a lot more than you. HAMAS states its constitution clearly.  THE US and everyone suffer the issue of moslems having Oil.  With and Without oil they offer the world nothing but grief. That's how it is ..

1783 2018-05-07 20:17:14 It won't be bad for the American oil economy because American isn't relying on Iranian oil.
1784 2018-05-07 20:17:09 Come to Cali when you can - in the meantime, CBD oil is worth a try.

1790 2018-05-07 20:16:41 Cancel the iran deal and then open the spigot on the Strategic Petroleum Reserves and cause the price of oil to drop to less than $30 and impose strict sanctions.  This will bring iran to her knees in a couple of months.  It might even cause a coup in iran.
1791 2018-05-07 20:16:39 I agree Jackie!
1792 2018-05-07 20:16:38 Just cause we live in an oil and gas dominated city doesn’t mean we are all makin oil and gas money, y’all bout lost your damn mind with these apartment rent prices. 
1793 2018-05-07 20:16:38 Hillary would have broken the back of the American worker, stepped on the feet of the coal and steel mines, and put our oil company's on crutches. Thank God Trump is our President!

Oh that’s me 

1798 2018-05-07 20:16:12 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
1799 2018-05-07 20:16:09 Was reading that the increase in oil prices are in part because of Trumps saber rattling on the Iran nuclear Treaty  during the last administration you did’t see any of this.
1800 2018-05-07 20:16:06 Started a batch of calendula oil today!  so excited!
1801 2018-05-07 20:16:04 Nope, safety regulation is always better.

1804 2018-05-07 20:15:58 Alaskans own 18,546 shares of AKER BP ASA, worth $297,120. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in NORWAY.
1805 2018-05-07 20:15:49 You will never see the savings. The prices are being adjusted bc of more fuel efficient battery operated crap cars.

Trying to force ppl to buy them. 

They think batteries the size of a car in our landfills is better 4 the environment! Oil industry isn't going to give up profits
1806 2018-05-07 20:15:41 So closer to normal bread than to a baguette/ciabatta? I have not tried normal bread like that yet but I am a fan of ciabatta and this other bread that they bake with a ton of oil, olives and cheese clumps with salt on top of it. I forgot how it's called but it's so good.
1807 2018-05-07 20:15:41 Oil prices on record high in 4 years, no militant bombing oil pipelines no any agitation from Niger Delta.. this government should stop complaining please.
1808 2018-05-07 20:15:35 My much older brother of course..... You only get the girlfriend half your age if you own your own oil company.
1809 2018-05-07 20:15:33 and remember, Putin loves higher oil prices ....
1810 2018-05-07 20:15:31 I love the oil industry. They make a product that lubricates the moving parts in my engine, and I can drip it into my wood stove when I'm done. Two birds at once. #ClimateAction

1813 2018-05-07 20:15:08 But I use nail oil before my base coat and then my nail polish and finish with the fast drying top coat 
Works great!
1814 2018-05-07 20:15:00 You mean you won't stand idly by while they sit on the largest oil reserves on the planet.

1816 2018-05-07 20:14:41 @MSNBC You do realize that anything Trump does that raises the price of oil, it benefit Putin, because it is Russia's main and almost only source of income.

1820 2018-05-07 20:14:00 Trump: Because I love War!

So do my @GOP colleagues, the Military Industrial Complex and my Rich friends.

No quicker way to make a few fast billion. Oil prices go up so Carl Icahn can win. Gotta replace the missiles at 2 million each & if we lose a plane or few, Boeing wins too

1827 2018-05-07 20:13:25 I’m the same with Armageddon. I’m just waiting to learn how to drill for oil and I’ll be banging Liv Tyler in no time.

1839 2018-05-07 20:11:57 Plus I love the way that Brexiters think that we can use the deficit as leverage. After a no-deal Brexit we will still need to buy olive oil, oranges, cars, cheese, wine etc from France. All that will happen is that they will cost us more. So it isn't much of a threat to the EU.
1840 2018-05-07 20:11:53 There is no responsible way to manage the byproduct of fission for generations 1, 5, 10 thousand years hence. Using the heat produced via fission to create energy is about as smart as combusting oil for said purpose. #RenewableEnergy

1876 2018-05-07 20:07:51 So conservatives won't be taxing oil workers?  I'm a health care worker and my tax dollars are going to oil companies spewing noxious cancer causing compounds into our air and water. If you care about healthcare workers, Don't tax us either.

1887 2018-05-07 20:06:10 Do you have tea tree oil or ibuprofen? You can crush up ibuprofen and put just a tiny bit of water in it and apply it as a paste
1888 2018-05-07 20:06:03 @realDonaldTrump I'm sure oil trading at over $70 a barrell is good for OPEC and oil companies.  But what it's doing to me is taking my tax cut money and putting it in my gas tank.  I thought we were going to be energy independent which I thought would lower the price per gallon.
1889 2018-05-07 20:05:52 Can I mix olive & castor oil together?

1953 2018-05-07 19:58:56 Cause and effect. Addressing cause more complex, time consuming and tedious than focusing on effect, doing "something," and moving on.

1955 2018-05-07 19:58:43 Iran fears send US oil above $70 for first time since 2014
1956 2018-05-07 19:58:41 Because throwing away the Korean Peninsula and a seven-decade commitment just to inflame the Middle East and jack up oil prices (which Putin and Big Oil want) makes so much sense.
1957 2018-05-07 19:58:34 If we can thrive without oil one day, I like to see this day that all Arab countries are declared bankrupt!
1958 2018-05-07 19:58:24 Try it out and see which one you like better. Kidding! It’s 3:1 oil to vinegar.

1960 2018-05-07 19:58:08 Oil instead?
1961 2018-05-07 19:58:02 Just had the biggest self care pamper sesh ever. Exfoliated with a homemade scrub, used an oil based essential oil soap that has legit made me feel like a dolphin ANDDD I moisturised and fake tanned  #teambeige
1962 2018-05-07 19:57:43 #TDL The oil the Nazi and Italian facist armies used during the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s was was provided on credit by a Republican Texan (from Texico). #history #antisemitism #neverforget

1964 2018-05-07 19:57:37 Don't think so...if it is oil money, why would you be batting for Syrian or Rohingya refugees?
1965 2018-05-07 19:57:32 Oil hit $70 a barrell for a the first time since 2014.  Many analysts think $3/gallon will be soon.
1966 2018-05-07 19:57:22 They didn't "change the maritime border in 1999 to get hold of more Scottish oil fields".  

That is abject nonsense.
1967 2018-05-07 19:57:21 Only at cornucopia, this bitch just put maple syrup in the soap container because she was using the soap container for olive oil because she put the olive oil in the chocolate syrup bottle  can’t even make this up
1968 2018-05-07 19:57:20 np!! yeah w/o sunscreen i heard the spots can get darker  if u feel ambitious u can start incorporating vitamin c serums or rosehip oil into ur skin regime too wwww

1970 2018-05-07 19:57:08 What if we trade him: oil for tunnel
1971 2018-05-07 19:57:05 If someone was working on your car (oil change) and found something personal and told people about what the found to the point that it got back to you, would you want that person to have consequences?
1972 2018-05-07 19:56:54 How strict do you want to go, because ive got stuff ranging from "sandwich with cheese and veggies" to vegan, to vegan no salt no oil no sugar nothing processed....
1973 2018-05-07 19:56:41 Do you think Harper cared about the First Nations? On the subject of the missing murdered indigenous women, he said "it's not a priority." That's the CPC for you, only oil & gas because Alberta's oil is mostly owned by US billionaires.
1974 2018-05-07 19:56:36 The real answer is the US won't change because then our blood for oil campaigns would be a tougher sell.
1975 2018-05-07 19:56:35 At this point, it's all speculation but will be interesting how it all plays out. One scenario you may not be prepared for is heavy selling regardless of the decision. So yes, the #IranDeal could get blown up and the oil market will still sell off.
1976 2018-05-07 19:56:34 No Paul. It’s cheaper to import oil to east coast refineries than ship it from North Dakota.

1984 2018-05-07 19:55:22 Thank you, yes. I'm the boring one as I'm a consultant to the oil & gas industry 
1985 2018-05-07 19:55:18 @ChampionRae So does this really work? LOL So warm up black castor oil or olive oil and just apply it at night or during the day? and basically, drink water every day.
1986 2018-05-07 19:55:10 Dept of Trans estimates at an avg mileage of 25 mpg,  a single #EV can displace about 468 gallons of gas per yr, or 25 Barrels of #oil
With our #EV I think I calculated we displace 32 barrels of oil!
1987 2018-05-07 19:54:58 What percentage of global GDP does the US have?  What percentage of global oil use do we have?  We actually use less oil as a percentage of gdp than we should.  We are efficient in our use of oil.  Is that not the true test?
1988 2018-05-07 19:54:58 That take is the oil fire in the land fill of bad fucking takes.
1989 2018-05-07 19:54:51 There are several uses for dry oil. I use it with my leave in CC & styling creme on wet hair & on dry hair. My new way....spray 10 pumps on your face, smooth all over, and rinse with a wet cloth to remove makeup. I also use it as a makeup primer.
1990 2018-05-07 19:54:45 There's no punishment severe enough for this criminal snake oil salesman.  Drawn and quartered might make it, but the family might sell tickets.

1992 2018-05-07 19:54:38 The Ipswich ones we had on Boro'line had air assisted steering, and that really takes some getting used to - feels like your forever hitting oil!
1993 2018-05-07 19:54:37 Nigeria so far has been a consuming nation and not a refining one.
We send oil out and buy it back as fuel.
We send students out and import them back as consultants.
We send ideas out and buy them as tech gadgets and apps.

The oil of grace gives to men the courage, and supplies to them the motives, for doing every day the work that God appoints to them. - ChS 263
1995 2018-05-07 19:54:29 Oil money?
1996 2018-05-07 19:54:21 There's no excuse. large oil and gas companies are not using "scrubbers" to control their exhausts!!! Cancers occur when toxins accumulate in person's body over time, typically 10-20 years out.
1997 2018-05-07 19:54:18 Lol you can ba a snake oil sales woman on the rez
1998 2018-05-07 19:53:55 I keep waiting for a liberal to demonstrate life without any oil! They don't have a clue!
1999 2018-05-07 19:53:46 Yep. Time to stir shit up in the middle east to raise oil prices and justify raping our coastlines and national wilderness areas.
2000 2018-05-07 19:53:44 Oil bb. All the oil x
2001 2018-05-07 19:53:32 @SecretaryPerry  Got thoughts on the #JCPOA decision?  Lots of drama but don't see you weighing even though it's your pond so to speak.  #oil #OOTT
2002 2018-05-07 19:53:27 The future of vehicles is likely to be electric. If advanced biofuels emerge that can generate electricity, that's a win-win for everyone. Oil is not sustainable and never will be.
2003 2018-05-07 19:53:10 Excellent advice. Coconut oil too?
2004 2018-05-07 19:53:08 OPEC Sec Gen Barkindo: calls for continued joint work to preserve oil gains 

NOTE: the OPEC semi-annual meeting is scheduled for June 22nd. Oil producers will review the progress made in the oil cutting accord at that meeting.
2005 2018-05-07 19:53:07 Exactly, Hope y’all got your castor oil.
2006 2018-05-07 19:53:05 You forgot Big Oil, with it's tax break, they are raising prices and making record profits and we are paying for it with our $1.50 tax break
2007 2018-05-07 19:52:57 Llama la atención que ninguno de estos “dos que empresarios” colocó para sus empresas nombres criollos, algo así como Carupano Oil Trader o Tucupita Group.... todos nombres “pitiyanquies” y después estos corruptos repiten que el Imperio es maluco.... 
2008 2018-05-07 19:52:55 Went to get the $14.00 oil change.... left paying $200. I hate cars !
2009 2018-05-07 19:52:46 as an enlightened soul I always purchase natural peanut butter (=peanuts and salt). Not only does this taste better but it also requires me to spend 5 minutes stirring and spilling peanut oil everywhere after opening a new jar.
2010 2018-05-07 19:52:45 we still blame Ironsi, for changing governance system 
We still blame Gowon, for not planning
We still blame the military era for  kickbacks, allocating oil wells and corruption 
I see no reason, why we can't blame PDP for their actions\inaction
APC will also be held accountable
2011 2018-05-07 19:52:40 No. It was water, just saying I'm grateful it wasn't oil or something.
2012 2018-05-07 19:52:28 #OOTT | If ConocoPhillips is successful, then it will limit the revenues #PDVSA will have and give them even more problems paying their bills and producing their oil. @TradEnergy #WTI #Brent $CL_F #Venezuela
2013 2018-05-07 19:52:13 I use hask argan oil from Morocco shampoo and conditioner and the little oil thing I put on my ends before I apply any heat to my hair and it’s helped a lot and it lasts forever cause it’s such a small amount needed it’s like five bucks a bottle but totally worth it!
2014 2018-05-07 19:51:59 Coconut oil is high in natural saturated fats. Saturated fats not only increase the healthy cholesterol (known as HDL cholesterol) in your body, but also help convert the LDL “bad” cholesterol into good cholesterols. By increasing the HDL in the body, gives you a heart.
2015 2018-05-07 19:51:46 Better buy high amounts of oil products couse Israel will not only make strikes, they want fully destroy Iran regime and Hezbollah.
2016 2018-05-07 19:51:44 Wishing I was drinking a cold beverage and watching @MLBNetwork right now, instead of sitting in a hot Jiffy Lube waiting for them to change my oil. 
2017 2018-05-07 19:51:41 Oil just crossed $70/Barrel for the first time since 2014. Hear Ed Morse explain how oil prices are set and how oil moves markets.
2018 2018-05-07 19:51:33 We will continue to give corporate welfare to gas corporations oil corporations mining that will destroy Bristol Bay worlds Largest wild salmon spawning grounds but won’t invest in real Alaska jobs in solar wind & Hydro clean energy projects that serve Alaskans!

2020 2018-05-07 19:51:31 I love how my wash day routine is completely different from most youtubers. If I ever want to actually detangle my hair, I HAVE to do a hot oil treatment or I’m gonna be stuck in the shower for hours.

2025 2018-05-07 19:50:34 Why would No Korea trust anything from this administration going forward? I don't get it.  I would have thot Putin would have persuaded his orange pawn not to do this, unless of course higher oil prices benefit him.

2030 2018-05-07 19:50:04 None of these jobs will be going to Alaskans you made that very clear when you sold the entire project China. Even building a runway and airport for the Chinese. Knowing Alaska just lost 1/3 of our north pole ice 45° above normal Alaska is already giving corporate welfare to oil
2031 2018-05-07 19:50:01 Oil goes up again ?

“Why?”

“Because like olive oil I am also extra virgin”
2035 2018-05-07 19:49:48 The Canada Pension Plan is one of the largest institutional investors in the oil patch, including publicly traded companies and direct private equity investments.

2037 2018-05-07 19:49:30 My way is my life, the car is my body, my heart is the engine, the oil my blood, the gasoline is my food, my soul drives the car, the bumps are the challenges and problems.
2038 2018-05-07 19:49:30 You can always use olive oil
2039 2018-05-07 19:49:19 Avocado dressing, no hidden sugars 
1 avocado
1/4 cup of sour cream or Greek yogurt
1 tablespoon lemon juice
3 tablespoon olive oil
Splash of water
Pink salt
Pepper
Garlic salt 

I doubled this recipe and added a little extra sour cream and water to make it smoother. It's yummy!
2040 2018-05-07 19:49:19 First generation is helping us build infrastructure! It lessens our dependency on foreign oil too! I’d rather support our farmers then OPEC. You choose whatever you want, but I’ll choose the higher blends every time. I only use E30 and E85!

2044 2018-05-07 19:49:05 Do you supply the oil or does the Customer? 
2045 2018-05-07 19:48:53 I need my car washed but I’ll just wait until I go to the dealership for an oil change and have them wash it.
2046 2018-05-07 19:48:52 Get that rosehip oil!!! Every night before bed!
2047 2018-05-07 19:48:51 that moment when you go to the jeep dealership for an oil change, barely speak to him. really don’t care to see him. guess it’s time to move on.

2054 2018-05-07 19:47:57 It is British oil in British waters.

That's where your argument falls flat.

We reaffirmed in 2014 that we wanted to remain British and that therefore renders your memes meaningless.
2055 2018-05-07 19:47:57 $EGY should strong earnings this quarter as the oil price has been over around $70 in the past quarter and look for $2 shortly!
2056 2018-05-07 19:47:33 Dear Mr. President:  what is going on with the gasoline prices, etc. in the U.S.?  Oil is at $70 a barrel - sure looks like we are paying a lot more than that!  Please fix it!

2059 2018-05-07 19:47:24 I asked my 33k fb group (oil patch group) the same.  As a women do you think you get paid less, than a man doing the same job, same exp, same skill. So many responses, almost unanimously felt wage equality.  A lot of trades people.  And yes there are lots of women in trades
2060 2018-05-07 19:47:22 So the 1st thing that came to mind is how did you prepare him? Olive oil and garlic or just a few quick minutes on the grille 
2061 2018-05-07 19:47:21 Better still would be to transition of oil by investing in in electric transport. Trains and buses with emphasis on cycling and walking.
2062 2018-05-07 19:47:14 We had our T9 do this after morris but a new valve block on our contour drill. The issue was the case drain couldn’t handle all the excess oil coming from the bar when raising/lowering. Put a seperate case drain in back to the hyd tank.

2065 2018-05-07 19:47:10 perhaps he really doesnt want oil to go up anymore as stated 2 weeks ago towards OPEC? 
one thing is for certain, Trump is a champ at cleaning up his drama right or wrong, the guy just does it well, otherwise he wouldnt be a Billionaire and POTUS
2066 2018-05-07 19:46:54 I haven’t plucked my eyebrows since December and they are almost perfect baby bushes! 

Jojoba and castor oil are the key to my success though, honestly.
2067 2018-05-07 19:46:49 Simply put, if Texas and Florida made laws saying you have to burn an oil put in your yard, you should have to because you gave up your representation because majority rule sounded more fair.
2068 2018-05-07 19:46:47 Just admit it. You want to install a dictator that will let you raid Venezuela’s oil reserves.
2069 2018-05-07 19:46:46 I can't find the watery oil, can u dm me the pic. Thanks 
2070 2018-05-07 19:46:26 me to eva at bugerfi: wow they fry everything in peanut oil so amrita can’t eat here bc she’s allergic

2071 2018-05-07 19:46:23 That’s quite anti-USA; almost treasonous.

2075 2018-05-07 19:46:05 Coconut oil really the truth. Crazy.
2076 2018-05-07 19:46:03 Then you would have used your time in office to kiss Auto sector butt as opposed to the collective ass of the oil sector, thereby ensuring yourself a cushy job, prior to being voted out?
2077 2018-05-07 19:45:57 In my opinion, if I rode the oil rally up to here, I would be selling today. I think it will be a case of sell on the news and oil prices will go down from here. What is the point of having allies when you appear gung ho to act unilaterally.  Common sense usually prevails.

2087 2018-05-07 19:45:02 Courage ? looking for tweets here aren’t we how about 500m quid there have been some brilliant winners of the premier league over the years UTD and Arsenal to name two both at there best would of been a match for the Oil Barons
2088 2018-05-07 19:44:58 Oh yeah def. Like. Mom's always like "Look I'll use x essential oil for y, but only because I know exactly how to use it safely? You can't just use them willy-nilly and 90% of the stuff in stores is sketch?" and so on
2089 2018-05-07 19:44:51 Why would No Korea trust America after this?  I don't get it. Does Putin want more $$ oil so he's not manipulating his orange pawn?
2090 2018-05-07 19:44:37 i fast in am, coffee black with mct oil, i have more energy than ever. also losing weight
2091 2018-05-07 19:44:37 PSA from ur local nature freak: put one drop of lemon essential oil in your water when you wake up every morning and watch how much brighter you’ll glow 
2092 2018-05-07 19:44:24 I had a 3 o'clock appointment for a oil change at @goodyear and was here 10 minutes before and I'm still waiting for my car to get done.
2093 2018-05-07 19:44:08 Oil production could have been ready by 2017, the behind the doors higi haga still puts us to 2020.
2094 2018-05-07 19:44:04 Ok, Grasso says oil has peaked if ANYONE hears Gartman say the same let me know.
2095 2018-05-07 19:44:03 Oh and by the way your foolishness is driving the price of gas through the roof because the world is think sanctions will affect the availability of oil. This will kill economic growth
2096 2018-05-07 19:44:01 John Davison Rockefeller Sr. payait un cercle de réflexion au sein de sa fondation sur la lecture minutieuse des textes de Marx et d’Engels qu’il avait trouvé « fascinante de clarté » dixit le créateur de la Standard Oil. #SormanatoujoursRaison

2098 2018-05-07 19:43:56 Normally, my husband will slide a $20 in my wallet to surprise me. This time, he slid $60 on top of filling my tank and getting my oil changed yesterday. Did he hit the lotto on the low?
2099 2018-05-07 19:43:54 Yep. Big Oil or Big Tobacco lying about how their product doesn't kill people.
2100 2018-05-07 19:43:50 Jordan, I like following your articles but each time I see one of your tweets on oil prices they have reversed either way by the time I read your tweet. Maybe you should start a long/short commodity fund.

2103 2018-05-07 19:43:42 if US leaves and sanctions imposed - will Iran leave current agreement and will they be able to continue to sell their oil, whats your take @Lee_Saks ?
2104 2018-05-07 19:43:40 But what's his plan? Like the oil & gas thing. Keep digging and *hope* to finally find a viable gas or oil field? It hasn't happened yet. It's great he's optimistic, but *hoping* isn't a plan. The do-nothing plan for water degradation isn't helping anyone either.
2105 2018-05-07 19:43:38 Need more olive oil.
2106 2018-05-07 19:43:37 Not bad for the environment. Farmers are practicing conservation now, they take care of the land unlike oil companies.
2107 2018-05-07 19:43:22 At the moment I would expect around 270bopd gross with a year end aim excess of 1000bopd.  Key is the low cost capex. Less than $1000 per flowing barrel and what we expect will be confirmed low cost production. All in the safest and best place to produce oil in the world #Texas.

2110 2018-05-07 19:43:02 I was v disappointed this wknd when opening up what I thought was a "clean" jar of @WholeFoods 365 brand peanut butter; I usually buy PB w/ just peanuts (& maybe salt), but in noticing a diff flavor on this jar I looked @ list & saw palm oil. Get that outta there, WFM!

2122 2018-05-07 19:42:13 If that is the case I highly recommend you put some olive oil in your car when the time comes to change it.
2123 2018-05-07 19:42:09 You know how to check your oil levels?
2124 2018-05-07 19:42:09 Light mayo contains a higher percentage of water than oil in the ingredient list. Choose a canola-or olive oil-based light mayonnaise to lock in heart-healthy fats.
2125 2018-05-07 19:42:09 The final goal is perhaps allow hand to hand combat in self defense if even that. Maybe just bowing your head and accepting fate is better?
2126 2018-05-07 19:42:08 Daniel weeded and watered the garden, washed and put away dishes and put oil and water in my car while I was at work. He may just be a keeper
2127 2018-05-07 19:42:00 Oh then just check your make model and see what kind of oil you need

2137 2018-05-07 19:41:04 most if not all of the foremost nations that import Iran oil need to agree (and have said they wont back out) and this has until July for full effect, not 05/12

insane how easy this was to learn while major media outlets fail to mention
2138 2018-05-07 19:41:00 Yes it was! Wagyu beef and I cooked everything with coconut oil.
2139 2018-05-07 19:41:00 Me importa 3 cara**s que la empresa OIL esté a un paso de la quiebra.

2141 2018-05-07 19:40:53 What will Obama say or do?  Will No Korea say: why bother negotiating when America's word is no good? Just asking. I expect oil prices to spike. I would have expected Putin to say something to his orange pawn, except he'll benefit from $$ oil. I wonder if Kochs or Mercers care?

2152 2018-05-07 19:40:09 I'm counting on that, along with a handful of other easy obvious turnarounds to have Oil back in playoff picture without shaking up too much.

2155 2018-05-07 19:39:55 And yet I have yet to see one coated in oil from perching sideways (or upside down for that matter) on an oiled post.

2164 2018-05-07 19:39:15 EU wants nuke deal with Iran because Iran decided to dump the dollar and instead settle oil in Euros as well as make it their official accounting standard. Gloablists rejoiced.

2166 2018-05-07 19:38:58 Cattail pasta review: first of all... fucking delicious and nutritious. Hella starchy but I cooked with salt and oil and it was yummy as hell. I tried cooking the leaves but they’re hella fibrous and aren’t that chewable. Plus it’s totally free
2167 2018-05-07 19:38:50 Not at all Deb I acquired  them from work prior to retirement I also have four industrial sieves you can achieve they same with an oil drum cut in half !

2169 2018-05-07 19:38:44 NaBrO it's OIL RIG (oxidation is losing, reduction is gaining)
2170 2018-05-07 19:38:43 I think the winter problem is that they need to puff out their fur to stay warm and the oil prevents it. Also the oil doesn’t have to freeze for it to transfer heat away faster, it’s pretty much used for that purpose.
2171 2018-05-07 19:38:40 @ianbremmer tells @KatyTurNBC that if Trump pulls out of the Iran deal, oil prices are going to $70 a barrel.
2172 2018-05-07 19:38:36 In that way, isn't Big Ed the equivalent of Big Oil on the Left? Don't bite the hand that feeds you, the same one that holds a tight leash. 

I spend way too much time strategizing ways to coax fellow Ds into taking truly progressive and equity minded stances on Ed.
2173 2018-05-07 19:38:35 I've seen the snake oil salesmen of your brexit crystal ball. That's enough to tell me, you should ask for your money back.
2174 2018-05-07 19:38:34 I said all of them.

As for Norway, the UK isn't Norway.

Norway owns its oil.

UK Oil is owned by BP, Shell, Total etc for starters.
2175 2018-05-07 19:38:08 Oil change and vavle checks are the drawback, new oil every 17 hours but doesn't hold much and single filter to swap. I won't be doing huge mileage so not concerned
2176 2018-05-07 19:37:55 I am pretty sure he means the relentless whiners who can't let go and move on. There is an article that the Oil Knight wrote on chia haters vs chia pets. Its really good, check it out if u wish
2177 2018-05-07 19:37:55 What a fucking hypocrite. Trump wants to cut foreign aid to the neediest countries of the world and it occurs to Pence that Venezuela is exempt. Oil?
2178 2018-05-07 19:37:50 $GBR 5 Good reasons for overnight 1) Ascend Triangle Break 2) Oil is at 4 year highs 3) $NFEC Oil name running 4) Following trend 5) price

2180 2018-05-07 19:37:39 Everyone should probably fill up tonight before Trump leaks the news to his oil buddies and speculators.

The Dow is up 170 pts.  Chevron, Exxon, Apple all trading higher.

2185 2018-05-07 19:37:07 They are doing this to cover a deficit that is already there since they screwed with the crude oil prices!

2194 2018-05-07 19:36:10 The US lived without Iranian oil for 25 years. But liberals and CNN act like the US economy will fall if we kill the deal now?!
2195 2018-05-07 19:36:05 any pros and cons on getting an oil change?
2196 2018-05-07 19:35:59 Doesn't higher oil prices mean more oil used...?
2197 2018-05-07 19:35:51 That you guys should take care and you check the red  one OGX catering oil shampoo is just 700rs and its price is 2400rs..  really this is insane..

2216 2018-05-07 19:33:50 It's no different than the oil embargo of the 1970s, but instead of just dealing with expensive oil Japan attacked.

2223 2018-05-07 19:32:53 Damn you list half of what the Government is doing and wouldn’t be without the Socialist Democrats. Oddly Obama’s original voter registration later changed to run for office. Call me when Gov takes over Oil Co, Auto industry, Farming Corp, ownership of land in fact!
2224 2018-05-07 19:32:51 And just how much oil prices will go up as a result of this
2225 2018-05-07 19:32:45 Stock market down year to date. 

Manufacturing down year to date. 

Housing starts down year to date. 

Price of oil significantly higher. 

Economy slower in 2018 than 2017.

Tens of millions of companies received tax cuts; hundreds paid bonuses. 

Not confused at all, thanks.

2227 2018-05-07 19:32:39 Riley and I went to the drive in theater last night so I have tons of pillows and blankets in the back of my vehicle. I’m getting my oil changed and I feel so self conscious. I swear it’s not anything weird. 
2228 2018-05-07 19:32:29 How nice of you to let them all park there. I hope no one leaked oil on that beautiful driveway.
2229 2018-05-07 19:32:28 What oil is a real good hair moisturizer?
2230 2018-05-07 19:32:19 Not only petrol, but also palm oil! Which India is short of and is forced to import.

2232 2018-05-07 19:32:00 Oil up from $42 per barrel to $67 when we are producing more oil. Soy bean farmers are taking a “yuge” hit. The Dow had its worst quarter since the Great Depression in the first quarter of this year. That’s just the first three things off of the top of my head...
2233 2018-05-07 19:31:57 Kids ki nose main olive oil laga dein. Aram say so jain gay . InshaAllah.
2234 2018-05-07 19:31:56 That's cheap at twice the price. We pay £1.23 per litre...go work that out. The US has been getting its oil cheap at everyone else's expense
2235 2018-05-07 19:31:54 Oil Stocks selling off on announcement that President @realDonaldTrump will announce his decision on Iran tomorrow afternoon...

2240 2018-05-07 19:31:02 Hey there! Just wanted to let you know that the certified organic & fair trade palm oil we use in our bar soaps comes from small-holder farms in western Ghana (through our own sister company, Serendipalm)—where oil palms have been grown for centuries; (1)
2241 2018-05-07 19:30:59 Yet if the deal goes, oil prices go up. I wonder how Putin like that idea.
2242 2018-05-07 19:30:55 Duuuuude the shit I do for my dog. I just finished giving her a spa treatment and topped it off with some coconut oil on her coat. Shiiiieeet not even for myself yikes 
2243 2018-05-07 19:30:54 Y’all do realize that birth control is a mix progestin and estrogen, right? Estrogen is found naturally in the body, and progestin is a synthetic form of progesterone which is also found naturally in the body.
It’s like using synthetic oil vs regular oil for your car.
2244 2018-05-07 19:30:52 Regional events are leading to higher oil prices- the market is pricing this in. I'm not sure the market is pricing a potential drop in oil prices if other producers (Libya, Venezuela and shale etc) get their act together and flood the market
2245 2018-05-07 19:30:41 listen..those words don’t mix with me. it’s like water and oil
2246 2018-05-07 19:30:33 Ok so diluting it with olive oil and the like would be safe for the skin. Thanks

2256 2018-05-07 19:29:31 Ever heard of tanning oil?

A BONUS that Scotland would keep, not being squandered away by Westminster!
& guess what!
Lots of other countries have taken their independence bk WITHOUT OIL REVENUES and NONE of them have asked to go back.
2268 2018-05-07 19:28:45 I'd say more oil than stuff and metal.

2271 2018-05-07 19:28:28 So do you drink it to make your hands comfortable, or is it like a self-massaging oil, where you pour it on your back (or wherever) and feel Comfortable Hands?

2277 2018-05-07 19:28:10 Lol what? How me needing an oil change is me being on the side of the road ?
2278 2018-05-07 19:28:10 So the biggest chunk of your oil is imported. 62%
2279 2018-05-07 19:28:09 Casing and tubing strings are the main parts of the well construction. All wells drilled for the purpose of oil or gas production (or injecting materials into underground formations) must be cased with material with sufficient strength and functionality. #octg
2280 2018-05-07 19:28:04 So to clarify, these protesters want more oil-by-rail running through Washington State and lower standard foreign tankers in the Puget Sound? That seems to be a strange set of demands for environmentalists

Also me: *goes home and takes 4 hr nap*
2297 2018-05-07 19:25:57 Japan needed that oil and would have taken it, if the USA wasn't protecting it.
2298 2018-05-07 19:25:50 Try Carrot oil bud. It helps with that kind of thing the next time yer out in the sun.

2307 2018-05-07 19:24:22 A lady nearby is telling saying that you can use coconut oil instead of sun block.

No.
2308 2018-05-07 19:24:20 I don’t own a car so I’m not required to be licensed to drive (or walk) or carry auto insurance. If I do ever buy a car, voila, I will be required to follow the safety regulations. The existence of the *thing* is what sets those requirements in motion, not merely me.
2309 2018-05-07 19:24:14 Oil Tanker expodes in the background as 30 cars pile up and and a plane loses control! Simply because they saw this live 
2310 2018-05-07 19:24:10 Yes! I was messin with mine so much it finally gave up on me. I started taking those and I swear by em. Also did some coconut oil masks, they’re apparently good for the scalp. Just spread the stuff all over ya head and let it sit. It’s gross and oily but it works!
2311 2018-05-07 19:24:06 And when that's done, there's the Wolfcamp shale.  Even bigger (potentially, anyway).  Just need oil to hit around $130/barrel, using current production cost models.
2312 2018-05-07 19:24:00 Literally had the smell of burnt canola oil at work for atleast 4 hours
2313 2018-05-07 19:23:58 Their soaps contain palm oil. Which is one of the things I listed that I wish to avoid.

2317 2018-05-07 19:23:25 try defeating 3000 per cent inflation when you have some of the highest oil reserves in the world.
2318 2018-05-07 19:23:20 Does it bother anyone that the POTUS hired a foreign black ops private spy organization to dig up dirt on Americans that used to work in the WH to further his personal agenda to allow his oil friends to become richer by reducing supply? Sounds Unamerican to me...just saying...
2319 2018-05-07 19:23:12 Offer incense, set flame
to sandalwood, give your soul
to the votive glow of oil lamp and candle;
all it summons is this secret bird of prey,
silence fluttering beneath the rib-cage.
So the slow burn towards divinity
begins from within...

2331 2018-05-07 19:21:40 The proper term is bitumen. Oil sands is simply industry spin to get acceptance of the product. Tar sands has been used as a term in Alberta for several decades even by industry itself. Both Oil sands and tar sands have become political terms and neither is appropriate. #cdnpoli
2332 2018-05-07 19:21:39 Difference is we’ve already lost and it’s already spilled. You see Enbridge cleaning up tar sands dilbit from the bottom of the Kalamazoo river? In Arkansas they had people in hazmat suits taking rolls of paper towels to oil in the street. No one knows how to clean this shit up.
2333 2018-05-07 19:21:31 Life of a tita: cleaning the house on your day-off then turning on oil diffuser afterwards.

2344 2018-05-07 19:20:07 To be fair, someone paid actors to voice support for Entergy’s power plant at local meetings and Entergy denies they were behind it. So “fossil fuel industry” seems appropriately vague given the context. Agree that in general it obscures diverging interests of coal, oil and gas.
2345 2018-05-07 19:20:07 No, he was a community organizer who hated the military, bowed to our enemies, sniveled and apologized to allies for existing and in general made the US look like a quivering purse dog.  He was a lead from behind snake oil salesman, and undermined everything this nation is.
2346 2018-05-07 19:20:04 Great question: 
Many plastic bottles (such as motor oil or additives) have micro sized air pockets created by Y shaped ridged designs. The air allows various products to flow freely when it interacts with air.

2351 2018-05-07 19:19:51 its so warm in my room that my coconut oil has become regular oil consistency instead of the solid stuff. so now if i wanna use it i gotta slop it onto my hand and mop away the excess later

Sarah is an aspiring oligarch as are most of the GOP! Billions to be made in oil once the sanctions are lifted.

2366 2018-05-07 19:18:42 I cover a pan with foil, put a little olive oil down. You can cut the okra long ways. Delicious.
2367 2018-05-07 19:18:38 Man, if I manufactured that stuff I'd have made sure my product name was Snake Oil.

Not because it doesn't work, mind you, just because it's expensive oil.

Strumming my six-string
On my front porch swing
Smell those shrimp, hey they're beginning to boil

2374 2018-05-07 19:18:17 So we get a short lived tax cut. If Trump pulls out of Iran deal and Saudi's want it oil will go up for sure. Saudi's want over $80 a barrel. Funny when we were fracking they said they could ship it for $10 and still make money. Our tax cut is squashed and then some. Sad future.
2375 2018-05-07 19:18:15 Found it - really interesting. Didn't realise where 'oil spot' theory came from. I have learned something today!

2377 2018-05-07 19:18:13 I date  a guy one time. He was going to check  my oil.  He then yelled why is your oil red.   Well that’s because you are looking at the transmission fluid dummy.

The other countries are holding onto there crude losing money and when they flood the market in the Future because they are broke they will make oil go down. Then we stop exporting when it drops.

2463 2018-05-07 19:10:47 There is no reason to end the deal unless you are either 1) trying to distract us, 2) want to start a war, or 3) you have stocks in oil. Since you took office the price of oil has gone up about $30 per barrel and fuel has gone up over  $1 per gallon. The people suffer cuz of you!

2465 2018-05-07 19:10:42 I’m sure you’ll decide to end the deal so oil prices rise and your rich friends and the saudis will be made richer.  Predictable!
2466 2018-05-07 19:10:41 there's no nation on planet who got such incredible impulse like World did to China by using old frienship project – worldwide orders+tech+money, even Russia only from influence of it got a golden rain by oil demand from asian neighbor (China near the Siberia).

2478 2018-05-07 19:10:02 So, perhaps there is a thinner oil that they can more easily and safely clean off themselves. Or wash off easily when it rains or whatever. Or offer another solution like, solar powered ultrasonic devices around the pole to keep rodents away. Or a bed of mint. That’s evolving.

2490 2018-05-07 19:09:34 Unless we drill baby drill and get lucky in Great Australian Bight the party is over. Good big oil fields are hard to find. We may drill and not find sufficient quantities of oil.  Some of our oils are light and not suitable for transport fuels and making bitumen for example.

2492 2018-05-07 19:09:28 Oil through $70 = bullish #EV
2493 2018-05-07 19:09:22 Wow. You really are exactly like Drumpf. Both liars. Shep Smith even proved the uranium myth was a lie.Obama in fact let there be a way for there to be inspections in Iran,unlike what’s coming down the pike next including oil prices,possible war,and skyrocketing gas prices for us
2494 2018-05-07 19:09:13 Might be the short squeeze from hell in oil tomorrow.
2495 2018-05-07 19:09:08 theres so much oil deanna
2496 2018-05-07 19:09:08 But don't forget to bathe it in Spanish Olive Oil!

2498 2018-05-07 19:09:00 lol, 5% is not an economy killer. Alberta oil is small change, always has been, always will be.
2499 2018-05-07 19:08:49 Organic Coconut oil just so the hair get right 
2500 2018-05-07 19:08:43 i'm sure everyone who passes my table at the library thinks i'm sitting here crying about my finals but it's actually because I got peppermint essential oil in my eye & my cornea is currently disintegrating

2503 2018-05-07 19:08:20 @LexyPanterra olive oil and natural ?
2504 2018-05-07 19:08:15 Is it leaking something? That looks like oil under the engine
2505 2018-05-07 19:08:08 Another leak from the White House? Oil weak ahead of Trumps statement on Iran signals he is taking a softer tone toward Tehran? If he does then SELL oil the oil contracts you can SHORT.
2506 2018-05-07 19:08:05 I see no reason to change now. The name has survived almost 90 yrs of oil and gas in TX & no one freaked out.
2507 2018-05-07 19:07:56 Maybe they have a guy who comes out to wash your windows for you and check the oil ,  now days they call the attendant a pimp?!
2508 2018-05-07 19:07:56 girl get u some coconut oil and micellar water x
2509 2018-05-07 19:07:52 coconut oil on my tiddies & some hemp oil for my cheeks
2510 2018-05-07 19:07:49 What’s your favorite? We know HBICs who make random lists, have a playlist, use a specific essential oil...and today on insta we chatted about a focusing meditation (which now I kinda want to get in on).
2511 2018-05-07 19:07:41 @karend888 u missing my pt. "the uncertainty" should spike oil and pressure stocks.
2512 2018-05-07 19:07:18 I always love it when I open a noodle and see extra spice or oil in it... I feel I have cheated them.
2513 2018-05-07 19:07:12 You should not have a decision on anything . Your ruining the great economy Obama left us. One example : oil prices going up which make gas price go up. Idiot Trump 24/7
2514 2018-05-07 19:07:10 O/N Wrap:
No data, but escalating oil prices provided a mild boost to equities and climbing yields on US Treasury Bills (3 and 6 month Govt. borrowing) gave the USD a bit of a lift. NZD remains unable to break below, or too far above, 0.7000.
2515 2018-05-07 19:07:07 Lipsticks are my weakness so can't help but treat myself to the new oil to matte lip elixir 

If you aspire to the new kylie Jenner lip look this is the lipstick for you. I am going for praline nude and poppy pink. What colour are you?
2516 2018-05-07 19:07:05 Of course it does, what did your parents say about the Moroccan olive oil
2517 2018-05-07 19:07:04 Add a little oil maybe but something tells me even a diesel would still sound like it runs better then that car
2518 2018-05-07 19:06:56 And will raise the price of OIL UP EVEN MORE!!! Trump is helping Russia get RICH!!
2519 2018-05-07 19:06:46 Who else thinks it's no coincidence that Trump-supporting Saudi Arabia & Big Oil (Deep State All-Stars) will be the two immediate beneficiaries of Mr. Anti-Deep State Donald Trump's likely announcement tomorrow that he's gonna spike oil prices by torpedoing the Iran Nuclear Deal?
2520 2018-05-07 19:06:38 President Donald Trump said via Twitter that he will announce his decision on the Iran nuclear deal on Tuesday at 2 p.m. Eastern. Trump has been heavily critical of the deal, and is facing a Saturday deadline to renew U.S. participation. Oil prices above $70 per barrel
2521 2018-05-07 19:06:36 Aren’t the prices more reflective of OPEC production constraints and Saudi Arabia’s intent to move oil closer to $80 per barrel?
2522 2018-05-07 19:06:34 Oil at a multi year high on international tensions. The countries involved and its big companies are the ones who profit from the tensions.

Little person at the pump pays for it. You don't need artificial intelligence to figure this out.
2523 2018-05-07 19:06:23 Rudy seems to making up stuff on the fly. Given enough airtime, he'll be  deputizing unicorns and explaining oil changes on time machines.

2530 2018-05-07 19:05:35 Right. And trying to clean themselves they end up eating the oil. So if we can do more than read about squirrels crapping their brains out b/c they were stealing food, we can offer other ways to solve the problem. Otherwise people are going to do whatever makes sense for them.
2531 2018-05-07 19:05:34 Oil and the major commodity indices reverse just as media finally puts the oil rally front & center. All the reasons why oil is going up from here...

2533 2018-05-07 19:05:17 U.S stocks indexes climbed, as oil surged above $70 a barrel for the first time since 2014
2534 2018-05-07 19:05:16 The global consumption of crude oil is projected to exceed 100 million barrels a day in the 3rd quarter 2018, the first time ever in history that consumption has reached that level. In 2017, the USA alone consumed 19.9 million barrels a day  (source: EIA).
2535 2018-05-07 19:05:15 Oil price tradie in world market is 22% higher, which varies every 24h. I paid last week 105 RS , & today RS 124 (in Germany in euro converted). No state or PM or President of world can control it, especially in India without GST system. In Kerala last month GST RS 13, Kerala 30

2537 2018-05-07 19:05:07 Fun theory: @realDonaldTrump is going to pull out of the Iran deal, so that Iran can get a bomb sooner. Then we will invade Iran, and take the oil.
2538 2018-05-07 19:05:00 Before you apply a new coat of nail polish, swipe nails with remover to rid them of oil and moisture, even if you aren't wearing polish. #protip
2539 2018-05-07 19:04:58 Of course you will and that decision will be to enrich yourself and hurt Americans. Putin and you got it planned to get that oil. Because of your greed, Americans are paying more at the pumps and we will see other prices skyrocket.
2540 2018-05-07 19:04:56 Let me take a wild guess: Bibi, Putin, Russian Oligarchs and his oil buddies will be happy. Iran will restart their nuke program and destabilize the region even more. All is good in Trump world.
2541 2018-05-07 19:04:52 anyone want to go get my oil changed for me today after school????:)))

2565 2018-05-07 19:02:10 The guy can’t even follow that this is a conversation on Trump. No chance he’ll pick up on the subtly we returned money we had seized from a country whose democratically elected leader we overthrew because of oil fields.
2566 2018-05-07 19:02:09 Ah, marketing. 

It works, but what else does? Almost all people will go for the newest, bright and shiny.
CBD oil is expensive, what could be comparable for those who must afford less?

2623 2018-05-07 18:57:45 I found a fragrance oil at Viddler’s that my mom used to wear when I was little and she would put it on me sometimes and I LOVED IT AND NOW I HAVE MY OWN AND IM STOKED

2625 2018-05-07 18:57:35 Oil probably time to take profit
2626 2018-05-07 18:57:15 Save your breath @realDonaldTrump. You are trying to drive up world oil prices. Simple as that
2627 2018-05-07 18:57:07 Poppers and baby oil probably

2629 2018-05-07 18:57:04 i’ve never had an oil place vacuum your car as a complimentary service, but of course my car is a train wreck and the place I went to does this  I am embarrassing goodbye
2630 2018-05-07 18:56:37 I'll bet what you really want is Iran's oil and that's what's motivating you to shake up the solid nuclear freeze secured by the Obama administration.  You'll start a war just to get their oil.
2631 2018-05-07 18:56:19 Based on predictable past behavior, any guess what the announcement will be? Consequences: Price of oil per barrel goes through the roof. You and cronies profit enormously. Higher price of Russian oil gives Putin more to build military and nukes.
2632 2018-05-07 18:56:16 @hereandnowrobin just listening Here and Now. The person who associated the decline of Orangutan population with consumption of palm oil is wrong. Orangutan natural habitat has less to do with palm trees farms .
2633 2018-05-07 18:56:08 There machine. 
That will calm an old lady whose heat out. And has a  frozen and
1940's  coal steam  boiler retrofitted with a propane, or number 2 fuel oil.
Doesn't exist.
2634 2018-05-07 18:56:07 The Ripping up of the IRan Deal  will bring oil prices up and we will see see gas prices zoom up as the Treaty is torn  up! This is a gift to the oil companies!
2635 2018-05-07 18:56:06 I'm actually trying a tonic from Dr haushka that I got from work (whole foods) it has neem oil in it - I'll let you know how it works for me!!!

2646 2018-05-07 18:54:59 They're not bad, it's not even raw, the pur and the filling are cooked. What Zahra has done is quite revolutionary, she has suggested a way to prevent a samoosa from experiencing baptism by boiling hot oil. She's a Samoosa Hero!

2651 2018-05-07 18:54:03 Weird. Its almost like they realized that the grassroots were homophobic bigots, anti-union, anti-science religious zealots and Kenney would never be able to deliver on what he promised his big oil backers because no sane company would invest in such a socially backward province.
2652 2018-05-07 18:53:57 I’m at work smelling like pure 100% tea tree oil so I might make myself pass out
2653 2018-05-07 18:53:57 Ready pay more at the gas  pump  oil prices hit 3-year high broke through the $70 mark for the first time since 2014
2654 2018-05-07 18:53:51 Andh bhakt _ when crude oil was 100US$ Congress selling 60rs , Now crude oil 32 US $ BJP selling 80rs.
2655 2018-05-07 18:53:48 Women and rejection is like water and oil
2656 2018-05-07 18:53:47 Trump know ripping up the deal will cause oil prices to skyrocket.  Because part of the original deal help lower oil costs. This will only benefit trumps oil buddies.
2657 2018-05-07 18:53:44 Your move will be affect  many developing nations , stick market and especially oil and gas sector industries.
2658 2018-05-07 18:53:39 Did you manage to stay cool? Oil got a little hot at one point, but a quick park up under the trees at Chatsworth sorted that.
2659 2018-05-07 18:53:38 Maddow reads big oil and pharma propaganda? Nothing like hyperbole I guess. She wrote a book about America’s “drift” toward militarism in its foreign policy.
2660 2018-05-07 18:53:34 I hear Oil Can Boyd is still available
2661 2018-05-07 18:53:25 Shannon Rivkin, investment director of Australia’s Rivkin Securities, said that oil prices had been driven up due to “growing concerns over the economic collapse of Venezuela and its oil industry, plus possible new sanctions against Iran from the Trump administration.”
2662 2018-05-07 18:53:13 #WTI crude oil $80 cents off the highs after #Trump tweet about #IranDeal. #Iran #OOTT
2663 2018-05-07 18:53:12 Because @realdonaldtrump is selling all our oil to foreigners.  The United States is the #1 exporter in the world of oil, we ship out more of our natural resources than Saudi Arabia.  Great job selling us out, President Dump.  #fakepresident #maaa
2664 2018-05-07 18:53:10 You need to take weed off the Schedule 1 drug list.  Weed is not the same as heroin and meth. Valium and Xanax are Schedule 4 drugs for God's sake.  CBD Oil and THC can help people with pain management.  Get that little Elf Sessions to pull his head out of his ass.

The man who ran Venezuela’s state oil company PDVSA for a decade after 2004 says that the country’s oil firm is on the cusp of total collapse and expects oil production to drop by 600,000 bpd each year amid lack of investment.
2672 2018-05-07 18:52:52 Energy sector is up 11% in the last month. With Oil prices on the rise plenty of upside ahead

2677 2018-05-07 18:52:39 Oh, come ON!  McKenna is completely wrong, of course.... but to call it a Notley/Trudeau recession is just nuts. It has 100% to do with the world price of oil collapsing in late 2014, when neither was in office. Lots to criticize about their policy response. But caused it?? BS.

2688 2018-05-07 18:52:01 There are two things (about) to happen. Those are the realisation that we are at the end of the global growth cycle, and at the beginning of an emerging markets crisis. Oil will spurt higher, but then realise it has nowhere to go but down. From afar, seems Trump cancels deal.

2695 2018-05-07 18:51:11 The Donald will announce his position on Iran tomorrow 8th May 2018...oil has already hit US $70 pb what with the Maduro fuckery! So, even if The Donald acts the fool & scraps the nuke deal with Iran we are already in for hella high petrol prices at the pumps! 
2696 2018-05-07 18:51:04 With Trump undoubtedly bringing bad tidings on his decision about the Iran deal #jcpoa and Saudi aims at higher oil prices regardless, expect $3/gal+ coming sooner rather than later even for those of us in the cheaper states. Sigh. What a great negotiator!

2720 2018-05-07 18:48:51 We know that Iran decided to settle Oil in the Euro while dropping the dollar thus we expect the EU will push to keep the deal. We trust that you will make the correct and best decision for our country and future.  #AmericaFirst

2723 2018-05-07 18:48:08 Trump to announce Iran Nuke deal at 2 p.m. EST...oil will spike and USD...well let's see what happens to USD. Be interesting to see if this has an effect on the Venuezualan Crypto Petro.
2724 2018-05-07 18:47:59 Been bullish on oil for over a year hence my large position in #trin which i s driving my portfolio currently. Agree it has further to run and $100 is certainly possible but preferred it being a contrarian view :-)

2728 2018-05-07 18:47:48 It was nonsense. £200m to start a new country and £6-£8bn a year in oil revenues. They had already dropped before the ref. AS knew that but kept mum. Minimum likely to start an Indy Scot. £3bn. Plus capital flight and rate rise loss and that’s before we get to currency.

It's why they ate into their reserves during the glut. It's well run capitalism that doesn't help your tax and spend arguments. Sorry Bernie lied.

2747 2018-05-07 18:46:28 I'm sure whoever signed off the embassy move is well aware of the fact they are literally spilling oil on existing big ol' pile of kindle, but they just don't care about potential escalation.
2748 2018-05-07 18:46:27 I just bought some organic coconut and tea tree oil! ‘After 22 years of life girl finally starts taking care of her skin.’ 
2749 2018-05-07 18:46:23 That’s true. A lot of people don’t realize that the Southern California region is still a big exporter of oil to this day.
2750 2018-05-07 18:46:17 that was a gift to sell oil   hope u did

2758 2018-05-07 18:45:02 You’re going to need to tell this to establishment Dems as well. The love their fracked oil and gas. Climate science says no new wells & no new fossil fuel infrastructure & immediate drawdown of existing fossil fuels. Ready to enforce that science?
2759 2018-05-07 18:44:51 @markiplier OK bro, can i offer you a pointer with your ghost pepper challenge?
1: dont drink milk, eat bread. the reason it burns is because the pepper releases oils that burn. liquid only spreads the oils around your mouth. bread will absorb the oil like a sponge.
2760 2018-05-07 18:44:48 @trish_regan ALL THESE COMPANIES RASING PRICES BECAUSE OF OIL WILL NEVER DROP PRICES WHEN OIL DROP OR TARRIF THREAT ENDS THEY USE MEDIA THE SKY IS FALLING TO JUSTIFY SCAMMING    AMERICANS

2769 2018-05-07 18:44:06 Well, water boarding isn’t torture.  Breaking kneecaps, shoving hot oil down your throat, electrocuting you or making your sit through endless sounds of Hillary Clinton laughing is REAL torture.
2770 2018-05-07 18:44:06 Oil ??
2771 2018-05-07 18:44:05 Oil hits $70 per barrel. While 50% of overall peak in 2008, 100% above its recent lows. Though excluded from Core Inflation, may impact consumer, if not Fed sentiment.
2772 2018-05-07 18:44:01 WTI OIL MARKS FIRST SETTLEMENT ABOVE $70 SINCE NOV. 2014 [MKW]
2773 2018-05-07 18:43:52 Classic shit argument. You credit the government when oil goes up but not their fault when it goes down.

2782 2018-05-07 18:43:11 Before you head out on the road to Mom's house, be sure to get your oil changed!
2783 2018-05-07 18:43:06 Shea Moisture, Cantu, & AsIAm

2784 2018-05-07 18:42:54 I pray that it won't be either. I'll get the magical holy oil to make sure it won't happen.
2785 2018-05-07 18:42:50 I'm not saying insider trading isn't criminal.  I'm just saying that my own personal experience proves it's far from a guaranteed path to wealth.  I couldn't trade into an oil bull if the entrie financial world stopped and looked at me imploringly.
2786 2018-05-07 18:42:45 What do you think a war between Iran and the U.S. mean for oil prices?
2787 2018-05-07 18:42:42 IEA predicts that oil demand will increase for the next 25 years at minimum. Should we meet that demand with the most ethically and responsibly produced oil in the world, or do you want the Saudis, Iranians, Venezuelans, and Russians to meet that demand?
2788 2018-05-07 18:42:30 Coconut oil is a blessing
2789 2018-05-07 18:42:25 I find it amusing that several of the "facts are no such thing. They simply represent the author not understanding the oil industry. Heavy oil is no more "junk oil" than diesel is "junk gasoline". Heavy oil is highly desirable in the market.

2791 2018-05-07 18:42:20 Remember, Dana is a snake oil saleswoman with her supplements. She, along with the President think they can decide who is a Patriot.  She won't acknowledge that Democrats, even those for gun control have guns and value the 2nd amendment.
2792 2018-05-07 18:42:15 Trump will make the wrong decision just watch. Everyone will be riding bicycles before it's over with because no one will be able to afford oil.
2793 2018-05-07 18:42:10 Ah, PC Burns, come on in, don't be nervous, the review will be fine.... Shall we start with whether you found the bunting ... #thearchers
2794 2018-05-07 18:42:02 Canada gives more corporate welfare to the oil industry than any other sector.  How about stopping the welfare to oil all together?  Would that make more sense? #cndpoli
2795 2018-05-07 18:41:55 Yea we struck oil after thinking bout quitting 3-4 times 
2796 2018-05-07 18:41:55 It’s a ridiculous idea. Does anyone apart from Boris & a few MAGA hats think Trump genuinely deserves a Nobel Peace Prize? During the Presidential campaign he advocated stealing oil from countries America invaded. Difficult to think of someone less deserving.

2798 2018-05-07 18:41:40 The price of oil has been rising on the possibility that President Trump will kill the 2015 nuclear deal  with Iran. Reducing oil price.
2799 2018-05-07 18:41:36 It’s 2018 why are products still being made with Palm Oil.
2800 2018-05-07 18:41:28 Oil, per se, isn't the objective neither for Iran nor for US. It's hegemony and exporting the Mullahs revolution.
Back to topic, why Assad is murdering his own people and destroying his own country?
A good rational answer will be appreciated.
2801 2018-05-07 18:41:25 Getting my oil changed five miles before the suggested change date is quite possibly the most adult thing I’ve done this year.

2826 2018-05-07 18:39:12 Why is olive oil so sexy

2837 2018-05-07 18:37:33 @Chrysler @ChryslerCares 
I am now cking oil every week. Friday they "topped off" oil that was down from oil ch 2wks ago. I drove 177 miles over weekend and oil down 1/2 quart. Really? I am stuck with a deathtrap and now, money pit. #dontbuya200
2838 2018-05-07 18:37:21 I've found that it helps people with extremely acne prone or even cystic acne prone skin bc it helps cut through the excessive oil...but after that point, they have to stop using it anyway to fully heal/rebalance. It is def not a long term solution.
2839 2018-05-07 18:37:20 Remember before sanctions on Russia oil was over $100/barrel. Analysts said if oil goes below$70/barrel, it would hurt Russia/Putin? Look at Trump's actions over past few months. All work together to raise price of oil, thus helping Russia.
2840 2018-05-07 18:37:13 I sautee them with butter and oil and garlic on high for a couple minutes, move the burner to low and put a lid on it, let it simmer for a while (like half an hour or so? Sometimes I get impatient but you want them to be pretty soft) and then season the hell outta them
2841 2018-05-07 18:36:59 Gas is about to get expensive. Oil just closed trading above $70, first time since 2014. $80-100 next?
2842 2018-05-07 18:36:51 Yes/no. To any educated citizen, scientist, or supporter of environmental protection and public health - he is unqualified and corrupt (this has been established). To any conservative who supports small-government, deregulation, and invests in oil/gas - he's their dream.
2843 2018-05-07 18:36:43 The debt ratio would certainly be reduced with more oil revenue coming into the province and supporting the industry that has supported so many PC governments in the past.
2844 2018-05-07 18:36:36 If we used are own oil, we wouldn't have to worry about high prices
2845 2018-05-07 18:36:12 I hate coming to get my oil change and stuff because then they wanna add more stuff which is more money and I’m over here clueless!! I NEED MY DAD!!
2846 2018-05-07 18:36:05 There are many great products out there now. Products with lanolin are best. Wendy Williams suggests vasoline petroleum jelly for feet but that’s too slickery for me. My face is an oil slick so I only use astringent. CVS and Walgreens have great products. So does Avon.

2869 2018-05-07 18:34:06 This serves as bait to lure more to come. How many die or suffer horribly because we refuse to remove the incentive? This is humane?

What's the matter? It blows your narrative about a booming economy and negates the higher pay the tax cut supposedly provided???
2891 2018-05-07 18:32:17 I’ve heard of using coconut oil on your face. I guess it depends on how oil your skin is and how much you Pile on
2892 2018-05-07 18:32:07 He didn't complete it sef he didn't put egg, groundnut oil, firewood,salt,onions,pepper, maggi. But why is it that we have a lot useless leaders in nigeria. Who swear for nigeria the Peron no do well oh seriously

2894 2018-05-07 18:31:52 It's funny cuz I'm an oil bull now. OFFICIALLY (meaning my position changed).

2896 2018-05-07 18:31:42 And he wants to make sure oil, gas and coal are our only energy options and if we all drove gas guzzlers again, well that would be great.

2902 2018-05-07 18:31:13 It needs a splash of good olive oil and do not grate the Parmesan but shave it.
2903 2018-05-07 18:31:12 Would you prefer it on trains and trucks ?  Pipelines are the safest way to transport oil
2904 2018-05-07 18:31:11 What's cruel is enticing ppl to make a several thousand mile journey enduring rape, torture, enslavement, extortion and death. That's cruel

2906 2018-05-07 18:31:10 I have just landed having returned from a very important, or don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
2907 2018-05-07 18:31:09 Wonder how the utilities will keep up: all that oil/natural gas probably will be replaced by electrons ...
2908 2018-05-07 18:31:04 Just like coconut oil. 
Some people skin and hair flourish from it but my body hates it.
2909 2018-05-07 18:31:03 so much oil on my face that I can deep fry a thousand chicken nuggets  fml 
2910 2018-05-07 18:30:48 Your favourite PNM & UNC politician is not campaigning to govern or represent you. They are campaigning to be the ones with continued access to the  oil money shared monthly. It is why you can die in dozens and they'll carry on campaigning. #Trinidad #VotePEP2020

2926 2018-05-07 18:29:37 1) No. You're wrong. Margaret Thatcher used our North Sea oil wealth to restructure this country. She created the single market to help and facilitate this restructuring. She didn't walk away from the EU. She took on the commission and the council and she won. She got a rebate.
2927 2018-05-07 18:29:31 No one takes your success seriously, like Chelsea and PSG, you were non entities before oil & will be the same after. Five league titles between you. The last time I was pained at a rival winning the league was 2013. A success built and earnt over a hundred years.
2928 2018-05-07 18:29:24 What? I hope you’re joking. Trump threatens sanctions on Iran and that causes oil prices to increase and it’s Obama’s fault?  oil was around $50 when Obama left office.
2929 2018-05-07 18:29:04 MyMondayConfession: I spent over $190 on Groceries this weekend this included stinky cheese, acme bread ( herb loaf) and $10 worth of Fish Oil vitamins ...I also spent $20 on junk food for movie night ( All the Matrix Triology on @hulu ) Still don't have Limes...Shame.

2940 2018-05-07 18:28:02 Stop ethnic cleansing? We support it if we can get the goods. But if they don't have oil, water, or opium, we wring our hands. (Rwanda and Bosnian genocides.) After the coup in Honduras HRC engineered, child refugees/orphans fled here for safety. She advocated their deportation.
2941 2018-05-07 18:27:56 im sure its the power steering cuz the 2010 fusions dont take oil so i probably gotta replace the whole thing
2942 2018-05-07 18:27:56 Had 73 as a realistic target since 65 for #CrudeOil but was expecting it to stall around 68-69 considering the strong bearish narrative #Fakenews pushes. Must say, I do enjoy watching oil continue to rip higher and watch those attempting to short this market get smoked. #OOTT
2943 2018-05-07 18:27:47 Consider we have no real national interest in the Middle East. We have become an oil exporter.  As for Korea, why do we really care. Pakistan is a nuclear power. Compared to them no one else makes me very nervous.

2950 2018-05-07 18:27:07 Guy oil prices start raising before Trump was elected. China announced a reduction in coal consumption of coal and production of steel dropped as a result. Same with rare earth metals. It’s more involved then Trump policies
2951 2018-05-07 18:26:47 S/O to my man for washing, vacuuming my car, changing it’s oil, smoking me some 2 whole salmons & for the daily affirmations today. You the best B. 
2952 2018-05-07 18:26:46 Hereeeeeeee goes The Oil.......! Summer Time It's That Time When Everything Goes Up, But Not Your Salary.....#breaking #GodBlessTheMotherLand where's the people that say that we fight for oil.....?
2953 2018-05-07 18:26:45 What is going on with today's oil volume? At $67.50 there were crickets. Now at $70 the buyers can't get enough?!
2954 2018-05-07 18:26:32 And look at that. An Indian that gets educated and all of a sudden things don't look as bleak. If you want to get out of poverty you need to get educated. Not just about oil and gas, this applies to every aspect of life. The more you know the better your decision is.
2955 2018-05-07 18:26:27 Although it's called Olive Oil it's a cream and not oily so rubs right in to the skin

2960 2018-05-07 18:25:43 Oil and arms sales, probably.
2961 2018-05-07 18:25:41 No, not at all. But US policy on Venezuela is completely controlled by the private oil sector, and it probably won’t change for a while. So you must have the self-determination to find solutions despite the sanctions.
2962 2018-05-07 18:25:33 I feel all tingly and fresh. I've massaged peppermint oil onto my forehead and neck. Oooh, it's a lovely sensation!

2967 2018-05-07 18:24:58 So he should be. He’s just been sworn in again with genuine approval ratings of ~80% and his biggest geopolitical nemesis eating itself alive. He’s also stopped the Saudi/Qatar oil/gas pipelines from being built in Syria solving an existential threat. That’s a lot of happiness.
2968 2018-05-07 18:24:44 We supposedly have all this cude oil and gasoline, but the price at the pump just keeps going up!! It's hard to make a living wage when gas is $3. per gal for reg unleaded. What's going on?
2969 2018-05-07 18:24:39 Just spent $100 between an oil change and gas... yall about to see me on a bike all summer
2970 2018-05-07 18:24:30 All $70 oil means is that their prices to the consumer will go up.
2971 2018-05-07 18:24:05 My car is so expensive when it comes to oil changes 
2972 2018-05-07 18:24:02 He's Delivering alright! Higher Profits to the  price gouging Oil Companys!
2973 2018-05-07 18:24:00 North Dakota is coming back online. I understand oil is 70 bucks a barrel now

In the morning, I do the same thing again except I use a little tea tree oil so my face doesn’t look too shiny

Big fear that I’ll end #Iran nuclear deal & destabilize the Mideast & oil markets!

2981 2018-05-07 18:23:10 Olive Oil is for your body and feet, it's very good, just hope it will give you enough moisture to your skin. I'm not sure what to suggest for your face, it sounds like you need a really good one, I use Elemis from QVC but not sure if it will ok for your climate.
2982 2018-05-07 18:23:06 what you have replied.
why  petrol price is lower in nebouring countries then india.
crude oil price is same everywhere
2983 2018-05-07 18:23:05 But bring the oil there? Lol
2984 2018-05-07 18:23:04 @pamwrightmedia Pam what were the coordinates of the 4.5 in the Gulf? Can you check and see if it is the same coordinates as the old BP Macondo oil site? Looking at the map it appears to be pretty close.
2985 2018-05-07 18:23:04 Harden is a snake oil salesman. Smoke and mirrors
2986 2018-05-07 18:23:00 Trump is heavily invested in oil company's. can we say insider trading. Impeach 45
2987 2018-05-07 18:22:58 Initially peak demand was pushed as counter point to peak oil (supply) theories. But these are intertwined. What happens when investors need a higher price to sustain production growth than is low enough to sustain growth in consumption?
2988 2018-05-07 18:22:56 Soon I’m gonna own my own everything, I’ve been pricing out all my equipment and I’m gonna pull the plug here shortly!  Moved back home to get my name out and it’s going better than i expected but it’s hard when ND comes knocking on my door, you can’t compete with oil money
2989 2018-05-07 18:22:38 Replacing Trump with a President just a little bit better, is of no value.

Obama revved up NSA spying, increased the wars, made Libya a slave market failed State, not close Guantanamo, sold fracking, TPP, oil in the Arctic & drone bombed everywhere.

Real change sometime maybe?
2990 2018-05-07 18:22:35 I like the ‘unprovoked’ part. Then again, the lesson taught me is that just because you’re opposed to the same thing doesn’t me you do so for the same reasons. And water & oil don’t mix. There lies the provocation.
2991 2018-05-07 18:22:30 What viscosity is your definition of thick? Talking like motor oil or quick sand? I might have to just let y’all take the plunge if we talking quick sand

2994 2018-05-07 18:22:16 He’s also been selling off our oil reserves to China, leaving with record low amounts of stored oil, also driving up prices (as the oil execs want to happen).
2995 2018-05-07 18:22:11 Pathetic! The @CPC_HQ now claim that the #CarbonTax will slow down growth in the GDP and take money out of tax payers pockets. Relying on oil is an economic mistake. This is nothing but lies and Anti #ClimateChange propaganda. #abpoli #cdnpoli #KeepItInTheGround #StopKM

2998 2018-05-07 18:22:01 This is why Canada has the regulation/safeguards/enforcement in place that make Canada the leader in oil/gas safety and environmental standards.

3019 2018-05-07 18:19:45 whatcha gonna do when the oil and gas is all gone?
3020 2018-05-07 18:19:43 Mr. Gandhi, u should get a good teacher! The gov hiked taxes on fuel as oil reached $28 from $115 highs since 2014. In such case, the gov had a good opportunity to increase taxes without causing pain to consumers (simple economics). Now the prices are up and the gov should..
3021 2018-05-07 18:19:41 I wish I could convert my car to run on hemp oil like engines did 100 years ago.
If people refuse to see how they exploit us then we deserve it.
They created a fuel source that they can manipulate the price from one day to the next.

Wrong in every way possible.

3031 2018-05-07 18:19:02 I can't even take CBD oil despite being legal because it might cause a false positive for THC which would get me kicked out of pain management.  Instead I'm on high doses of opioids that have a real risk of dependency.  If pot was legal it is more effective & less addictive.
3032 2018-05-07 18:19:01 Recent increase is a transient.  The light tight oil that is fracked from the Bakken shale won't last long and the investment is deeply leveraged.

3039 2018-05-07 18:18:25 Robin's concern is that the oil will fall into Iranian hands.
Do you really think that US cares about 700 k of heavy oil when they get and produce millions of tons of light oil?
3040 2018-05-07 18:18:13 Laws regulate people. Inanimate objects do not read or possess free will to choose. Targeting Law abiding ignores criminals. Target them.

3092 2018-05-07 18:11:33 Quite the contrary. In 2014 oil made up 15% of Scotland's GDP. With oil prices dropping from 110 dollars a barrel to about 35 there were many people made redundant in the North Sea oil industries. Now that prices are around $70 our wealth is increasing again. #bizforscotland

I've noticed certain primers don't go well with certain foundations,  start to peel off,  and it's cuz they are not compatible. I need to learn more.

3183 2018-05-07 18:00:46 Young guy at my work is a combat vet, who went on over 300 missions in Afghanistan.  His Purple Heart came from a day when his vehicle was hit by an RPG.

3190 2018-05-07 17:59:58 My car is getting a tune up and oil change i wont have time tomorrow morning Ima go
3191 2018-05-07 17:59:36 So basically I don't have to worry about them killing my bird with fumes? now I'm curious though, what can oils offer me that watercolor can't? Every time I see oil paintings, they are very detailed/elaborate, and aren't really fitting with my own artistic style.
3192 2018-05-07 17:59:35 2/2 importing oil from those stalwarts of human rights Saudi Arabia and Iran by the tankerful.
3193 2018-05-07 17:59:29 yeah @CNN would know the reason. GFB! Did the oil oligarchs want to buy some more land and slaves.
3194 2018-05-07 17:59:21 *sigh* bringing the Subie back to the dealership AGAIN for the same oil consumption issue. They replaced the entire small block less than 3,000 miles ago. Seriously waiting on that win, universe.

3196 2018-05-07 17:59:04 I mean, if this helps I did them last year and I’m not bad at science. So; The crude oil is heated and then it condenses in the column. The less volatile aspects stay at the bottom (nearest the heat). The most volatile go at the top, these are probably gases and ignite much...
3197 2018-05-07 17:58:46 Oil in euros up almost 50pct yoy. 10y bund at 50bps. How long can that last
3198 2018-05-07 17:58:46 If you look away from Trump, you'll see that oil prices just hit $70 a barrel. The system is working. #Resist

3204 2018-05-07 17:58:21 True, and the Canadian tar sands.  It's suits oil companies, the Russians, the Saudis (and maybe temporarily the Iranians) But not consumers, anywhere...
3205 2018-05-07 17:58:17 Guess little different than virgin olive oil, studies help.
3206 2018-05-07 17:58:16 It was VP candidate GHW Bush 41 who had the connections to arrange the October Surprise. Later, the leader of the Iranian hostage takers would prove a useful foil for GW Bush 43. 
Bush 41 was former head of CIA and from wealthy oil family (sold oil to Hitler) w/ Iran Connections
3207 2018-05-07 17:58:01 Standard Oil Company can be an useful case study...

3209 2018-05-07 17:57:35 On my engine there is an adapter between the block and the oil pan. I'm getting oil oozing from it into the cover between the engine and the tranny. I have read that the gasket between the engine and adapter is probably bad.

3217 2018-05-07 17:56:57 lmfao I had a fucking off day last Friday @ the hospital. All these little weird things kept happening to me & it followed me home. I just found my patient paper work that I’m supposed to turn in to my RN instructor covered in OIL!!!! Whhhhhhhhy 
3218 2018-05-07 17:56:52 From the RSPO website, it looks as if companies can be certified as buying RSPO-endorsed palm oil. It looks as if you are supporting the RSPO, but you don’t claim to be “certified” by RSPO.
3219 2018-05-07 17:56:47 Ants really is the only thing I've noticed. Small sugar ants. Annoying as hell, if you spray it with water and mint oil it'll get rid of them.
3220 2018-05-07 17:56:40 I'm pretty certain "self-serve" happened in dime stores long before it became the way for gas stations. I wonder how many never check their oil or tires when they get a fill up. Modern cars less prone to breakdowns, but still see many on roadsides. Self-serve = fewer jobs.
3221 2018-05-07 17:56:36 A more definitive separation of wheat and tares, of sheep and goats, of those who have oil in their lamps and those who don’t.

3226 2018-05-07 17:56:23 Weird how whichever religion dominates the ground above oil reserves is always "backwards" and in need of military intervention, eh? By the way, how's that child support coming along? Check in the mail?
3227 2018-05-07 17:56:21 I'll periodically vacuum my car and have it smellin good but I'll only ever actually clean it when I get an oil change and they give me the thing for a free car wash lol
3228 2018-05-07 17:56:14 I just wanna move into a place and fill it with dark and creepy oil paintings
3229 2018-05-07 17:56:12 Not really!! It was a faff!! I marinaded in oregano garlic and olive oil. Can’t taste anything!
3230 2018-05-07 17:55:50 Corporate tax breaks and higher oil profits.
Glad they drained the swamp and let the Leaches take over.
3231 2018-05-07 17:55:47 Ramen+Egg+Sesame Oil+Soy Sauce is my go-to for ramen, makes ten cent bags of ramen feel much nicer to eat
3232 2018-05-07 17:55:44 It is disconcerting that the gov’t needs to resort to posturing to say what it cannot say aloud. The threat of state sanctioned force against protest of an oil company’s project that was fast tracked by state? They seriously need to step back and think about what they’re doing.
3233 2018-05-07 17:55:38 Suffering from dry eyes?  Try cold pressed, hexane free #castor oil or #coconut oil.  It will make your #lashes grow too! #health #naturalremedies

3235 2018-05-07 17:55:23 Huh? Most of these facts are OPEN records. So, you think OPEN is now "left wing" also? SAD - you've had too much .@POTUS snake oil diarrhea punch! But, keep drinking to live in his DELUSIONAL world!
3236 2018-05-07 17:55:23 No the oil
3237 2018-05-07 17:55:11 How is it possible I've sat in the sun with oil on FOR TWO DAYS and nothing, not even a little burn I actually repel the sun how is this fair 
3238 2018-05-07 17:54:33 Afraid to read it... fish oil no good?
3239 2018-05-07 17:54:16 Oil and salt it is. Are you having a nice bank holiday?
3240 2018-05-07 17:54:09 No, he is removing regulations that hinder clean production of gas so America isn’t dependent on foreign nations for their daily gas consumption. Seen the recent hikes in gas price? All because most of the oil is from places like Iran. We can create jobs and protect the land too.
3241 2018-05-07 17:54:06 They didn't know we had so much oil then.
3242 2018-05-07 17:54:06 True! And as heavy oil importing countries fiscal deficit gets worsen  it's self-feeding vicious cycle risingcrude -> worseningfiscal - > depreciating local currency - > costlier crude - >...and game goes on

3244 2018-05-07 17:53:44 Truth is we get independence becaz of britisher understood they have divided india and they also dont have money since world war 2 was big blunder by them
Pakistan was created as strategy to get oil from Indian Ocean and other British interest!
Congress did nothing!
3245 2018-05-07 17:53:40 #MVN doesn’t have borrowings, doesn’t need; is fully capitalized. Gets paid for energy production in USD, expenses paid in Argentine pesos, so devaluation is good (but not something we would cheer for). Finally, oil/gas production are vital; Argentina produces <50% of consumption

3248 2018-05-07 17:53:28 Look at Iranian Prime Minister Mosaddegh. He nationalized Iran's oil, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company wasn't able to exploit Iran's resources anymore, so the MI6 went to Eisenhower and the CIA for help. Mosaddegh was ousted, the Shah was reinstated, the US trained his death squads.
3249 2018-05-07 17:53:23 We need to do an investigation on the price of oil they’re using Iran has their cost for raising the price when only 5% in 2004 was the supply from Iran Something crooked you going on get we need to get this corrected Donald thank you for everything you’re doing.
3250 2018-05-07 17:53:07 oil needs anything to keep the eyes away  from falling demand and rising US production.
3251 2018-05-07 17:52:54 Who watch CNC3 News? 
Notice when Oil price low dey state it
but when its high like now, they dont.

3260 2018-05-07 17:51:14 BBC /CIA hard at work tonight showing tiny anti-Putin demo who knows when footage was taken I guess it’s preparation for some stupid operation walk away USA unless your bankers control of oil is at risk  #orwellianbbc
3261 2018-05-07 17:51:13 Getting a long overdue oil change and driving my car afterwards is totally a non sexual act that turns me on
3262 2018-05-07 17:50:53 Yeah because oil spills are really good for birds... You're just making shit up, renewable energy sources are much better for the environment and animals. As a vegan I'm curious whether you're one too or are you just pretending you care about animals?
3263 2018-05-07 17:50:43 i got bored and decided to make my own lip balm. i just heated up some coconut oil and mixed black and magenta eye shadow, and it came out this dark purple color. it’s in the freezer rn & i have no idea what i’m doing or if it’s safe but YOLO 
3264 2018-05-07 17:50:29 If Trump reimposes Iran sanctions, with Venezuela in turmoil, and gas prices for US consumers continue to surge, who profits from rising oil profits? You guessed it...Russia.
3265 2018-05-07 17:50:27 Put coconut oil on it.
3266 2018-05-07 17:50:17 I'm looking into the Ketogenic diet and I realize our dog is already on it. His food is high in good fat and meat while it's also grain free. He gets coconut and salmon oil added as well. His fave treats are carrots and peppers!
3267 2018-05-07 17:50:10 They want prices high so it will be profitable to extract all the oil and gas from the lands they are opening up, including offshore, Alaska, and federal lands. And Russians are desperate for higher prices
3268 2018-05-07 17:50:05 All so called sanctions would be history if EU delivers its promise even without US .

There is also China , Korea and India would still buy oil and gas from Iran ...so called fake news being circulted by MEK will soon be exposed as just propoganda
3269 2018-05-07 17:49:58 What’s facial oil? :0
3270 2018-05-07 17:49:58 Tired of winning yet? Massive profits for oil companies while all of America pays more not only at the pump but on every single product while wages remain flat.

3272 2018-05-07 17:49:48 Was looking at this 'spreadable butter' product packaging and it said "With sea salt and olive oil!" Now wait. You gonna be adding olive oil to your butter? Why not just make it margarine at that point?I swear...
3273 2018-05-07 17:49:41 ‘We destroyed countries and killed a million+ folks for oil, hegemony, and the military-industrial complex’. They missed out this one.
3274 2018-05-07 17:49:15 Is there still a strong correlation between the Sasol share price and the oil price?

3277 2018-05-07 17:49:11 people who are complaining about high gas prices need to realize that they will continue to get higher because oil is a finite resource and we are running out of it!!!! renewable energy, folks!!!

Served it at the time with bright purple beet-drenched salmon and pickled cucumber garnish. Went down a STORM
3282 2018-05-07 17:48:48 I mix them with a carrier oil because I know about the effect some of them can have on the skin.
I will check out your post.
Thanks for all the info.
By the way, your hyperpigmentation post was amazing - i've kept the tab open so I can write down all the treatment options.
3283 2018-05-07 17:48:38 I'm lost???
3284 2018-05-07 17:48:27 Add cream, butter, tallow, or coconut oil to them for you John. (Although I personally go for canned salmon instead of Sardines except as a travel snack.)
3285 2018-05-07 17:48:27 I oil my skin 3 times a day plus coco butter. Idk if it’s helping yet

Ok if they are honest
The massacre in Baqam today
And targeting three oil stations in Saada
And a massacre by targeting a civilian home in Hodeidah
They were leaders!
The Yemeni people know very well the extent of the Saudi
3288 2018-05-07 17:48:18 you created a new strong economy,  now you are helping the Saudis  destroy it.  After the cancellation of the Iran deal it will be impossible to reverse the new high price of Crude oil,  I use " will"  would be better if I could write " would"
3289 2018-05-07 17:48:17 Nice  we use his same recipe but use canola oil instead of butter and pure maple syrup instead of sugar. Really good! The chocolate chips and walnuts are a must in my opinion
3290 2018-05-07 17:48:11 Unless a nuclear Iran is a precondition for KSA to finally (after decades of failure to build their own) get nukes. Or - wild spec - Russia wants Iran out of the deal to arm Iran with nukes and send oil prices higher?
3291 2018-05-07 17:48:03 Great...I got my first drive and oil price going up..what a time drive #oilprice
3292 2018-05-07 17:47:53 High #oil prices has pushed Govt into a corner. No good options. Like it or not fiscal deficit target will go beyond 3%, unless price controls, with debilitating effect on oil companies, brought in. But in election year all rules will be forgotten

3296 2018-05-07 17:47:26 I have never believed in cost-push inflation. Without monetary expansion, higher oil prices would lead to lower prices for every thing else. Substitution.
3297 2018-05-07 17:47:22 The gall of some property managers, my dude Frederick going with some weird power move where drawbacks are listed as features. "Simple Victorian, oil heat, electricity, a lawn to mow, shovel walks of snow"

3299 2018-05-07 17:47:12 Maybe hawt dawg man should start feeding the sasquatch. He burns the midnight oil often enough.
3300 2018-05-07 17:47:10 Matter of fact I need to go get some cash off my card and go find my oil man
3301 2018-05-07 17:46:59 I started on the short side of oil this morning via an ETF, not getting too bold, but probably warrants some short here
3302 2018-05-07 17:46:58 .@markraymond Thanks Brian! very difficult! @NBC is doing with oil, wants to cut spending, not funneling it to.
3303 2018-05-07 17:46:43 Lots of edible oil products out there & didn't @MMFlint tell us about fake food we ate as kids - pop tarts, twinkies, that powdery stuff with the liquorice straw. All chemical waste byproducts . (Had link to fake Michael Moore at first. TRUST NO ONE! )
3304 2018-05-07 17:46:33 axel's so nice..! i just hope he doesn't trip over all that oil..;;

3317 2018-05-07 17:44:23 idk buhhh I thought I was out of oil an I just hit my pen to feel cool and that bitch hit 
3318 2018-05-07 17:44:19 If Trump pulls out of Iran deal it's a decrease in available crude to the biggest user of oil (that's us) decreased supply always results in rising prices. Rising prices benefit trumps buddies especially Putin. With a side effect of fucking over the middle class.

3319 2018-05-07 17:44:07 It started with Birchers, then expanding their hate to anyone non-white, anyone not straight, condemned conservation and preservation of our Coast against over building and oil drilling...yeah...GOP is out of touch with California.
3320 2018-05-07 17:44:05 I came to splash for an oil change. Ended up getting a new air filter, transmission fluid, and a car wash
3321 2018-05-07 17:44:01 If ya'll can spare me, I can catch spiders and free them in the back yard, replace garbage disposals, fix the wiring in your home entertainment systems, and change the oil in your cars. All I need in return is: sandwiches.
3322 2018-05-07 17:43:57 Those gym guys at the steam room seemed to know a lot about gays, one said, “it’s tight, it’s just the same as a woman.” The other said, “they use oil.” Then he said, “life would be fine without women, I think I should just be gay...” .

3325 2018-05-07 17:43:40 Oil prices are ris mg because Trump wants them to. He is in bed with Exxon and the Saudi Government. Duh
3326 2018-05-07 17:43:34 Here's the answer, it's really simple. Oil should be considered part of our infrastructure as a country. If taken from our ground, it belongs to us. We pay taxes on it, it should be sold to us ,only, at a cheap rate. Problem solved.
3327 2018-05-07 17:43:28 What if all tRump’s ridiculousness is to distract from Pruitt’s corrupt roll back of building and environmental laws?  After all, almost all of tRump’s investments are in construction, real estate and oil.
3328 2018-05-07 17:43:22 I'm sure the dossier pointed out that the UK would be broke without Scotland's oil. And he changed his mind quickly.

3331 2018-05-07 17:42:53 I made natural deodorant with witch hazel, lavender oil, and tea tree oil. This deodorant cleanse is going to be rough but worth it.

3337 2018-05-07 17:42:05 Whats cannacoconut oil?
3338 2018-05-07 17:41:57 Bio-oil is just fillers, mineral oil and vitamin E, too much under the eye can cause milia. Try almond oil instead, it’s a lighter consistency.
3339 2018-05-07 17:41:49 There is no more time. Politicians have used up the last two decades in denial and expanded oil and gas. This means @bcndp must not develop expanded #LNG in BCs’ north. #bcpoli #nofracking

3. before you attempt to flip the fish over, remove the pan from the heat and let it cool down completely then flip it.

3390 2018-05-07 17:36:05 Unfortunately shale does not produce WTI crude oil and US oil imports are soaring again. Shale is just in the wrong market with the wrong barrels and is unable to bring oil down again.
3391 2018-05-07 17:35:53 I did a little taste test, it came out really good. Going to let it chill awhile to let the flavors blend a little more. But it's nice & light. 

I used Wish Bone Avocado oil & herb vinaigrette. Only takes a tiny bit. Light & tasty. Later,  I'll try making my own.

3435 2018-05-07 17:30:35 Hearing Noam Chomsky remarks on Trump. Let me rephrase his ideas into mogul jargon. Clean Air is a business unit that will go bankrupt if we don’t stop burning oil. The consequence of Clean Air going bankrupt is Global Warming and Unbreathable Air. Take that to the bank.
3436 2018-05-07 17:30:28 I’m getting the oil changed in my car. It’s just me and this white lady in the waiting room. I sit down and start grading papers. This viejita stares at me then grabs her purse and moves to sit across the room.

3441 2018-05-07 17:30:13 It's not for me. Hard on the adrenal system. I think it's a good alternative for many but yes, do thorough research. Not much real research on it as once again the government would rather ban it rather than have it replace the snake oil they're peddling at any given moment. 
3442 2018-05-07 17:30:11 About to lay in bed for the rest of the day after this oil change 
3443 2018-05-07 17:30:03 First oil change on my own, and HOO BUDDY IS MY ANXIETY LIVING. Anyone know how long these typically take?

3449 2018-05-07 17:29:12 While I did laugh, I mean it's kinda cute at first the way that squirrel is jumping up and all.. but then your mom could have fed it too! All I see is a hungry squirrel and apparently, from the comments, also a bird that might end up getting oil on its feathers which is bad news.
3450 2018-05-07 17:29:04 I do, he cut regulations to banks and EPA. Thus putting the power back into the hands of big banks, and allowing companies to dump into rivers. That raises the market. Also with the Iran deal news, Oil prices going up. When you give power back to the Top 1% the market goes up

3456 2018-05-07 17:28:03 That's why the country is in a mess, we want to drill oil and cause spill in our community, neglecting the traditional institutions because they're irrelevant and thier demands are to be swept under the carpet.

3463 2018-05-07 17:27:07 Why? Big oil has said over the years Russia could have more oil than the middle east. Plus Cuba will be a world Oil player soon. Time for Nat gas pipelines. clean burning.

3478 2018-05-07 17:25:00 If I ever get my hair done, I’m gone expect you to detangle my hair, wash my hair, blow dry my hair, oil my hair, braid my hair, sew my hair in, AND style my hair because that’s what I’m paying you for. If I gotta do any of that, I’m subtracting from what you charging. 
3479 2018-05-07 17:24:28 If that shipment come without my oil! I'll scatter things everywhere

3482 2018-05-07 17:24:08 Don't know an article for it but I'm super pro fat.  (I literally drink MCT oil for a snack sometimes.)

3485 2018-05-07 17:23:28 Cause he said to stay away. And because inflation is on the rise, meaning higher prices in metals/oil. More fundamental trade than anything

3505 2018-05-07 17:20:56 The #dollar rose to fresh 2018 highs on Monday while oil prices surged to their highest since late 2014, driven by declining Venezuelan crude production and worries the U.S. could re-impose sanctions on Iran.

3519 2018-05-07 17:19:02 I love using hemp oil on my face! I used to use argon oil, but only the light version. The regular version really broke me out. I’ve had no issues with hemp oil. My skin stays super dry and tight from swimming, but hemp oil does the trick!
3520 2018-05-07 17:18:59 oh!イル
3521 2018-05-07 17:18:52 FYI, you might want to change that to mud or oil. Jello is freaking COLD. Like, hypothermia-inducing cold, which is why the fad didn't last long.  

And STICKY. You can shower and bathe and shower again, and you will still be sticky a week later. And not in a good way.
3522 2018-05-07 17:18:48 Started my new job In The biggest Oil field company Today #Halliburton 
3523 2018-05-07 17:18:38 Making improvements in this whole adult thing. I’m getting an oil change when it’s due not putting it off for far too long! 
3524 2018-05-07 17:18:18 That's okay, Rachel. I just like to spread awareness about this when I can and see the opportunity. A lot of people don't know about the dangers of unsafe essential oil use with pets and I thought if anyone might see this tweet and be informed, that would be great.
3525 2018-05-07 17:18:17 honestly.. idk. all i use are Lush products, and a liquid form of African Black Soap. i use either Gold Bond Diabetic Lotion on my face mixed with a little bit of natural jojoba oil or regular organic Shea butter. that’s it, that’s all.
3526 2018-05-07 17:18:08 Yes it is, sabelotodo. It’s made of coconut oil.

3530 2018-05-07 17:17:32 If it’s not stuck on anything you can always try “lubing” it up. I’ve used soap and olive oil before . Just rub it on the track parts above and below the zipper.

3537 2018-05-07 17:15:46 I'd love to see the little label that used to be on every gas pump. It listed the Federal, State and local taxes per gallon. Now that the government have hidden this info it makes it a lot easier to blame Oil companies.

3543 2018-05-07 17:15:28 I use witch hazel to cleanse in the a.m., and moisturize with a 4:1 ratio of aloe and glycerin. At night I use a makeup wipe, follow with witch hazel, then either shea butter or grapeseed oil. I have psoriasis and I'm allergic to a lot and I like to keep it simple.

3556 2018-05-07 17:14:10 Also it violates the standard of identity. Once you add olive oil, it is now compound, not chocolate.
To pretend that people haven’t been using non cocoa sources of vegetable fats for decades is either disingenuous or painfully naive. 
But such products aren’t strictly chocolate.
3557 2018-05-07 17:14:08 You know you have quality friends when they will change your oil for you.
3558 2018-05-07 17:14:06 What do you use to oil it

3566 2018-05-07 17:12:34 well, at least gas prices are up a tiny amount, not surprising since @bloomberg tv was saying just yesterday oil approaching $70/barrel soon :-)

3575 2018-05-07 17:11:19 Using petrol-based fertilizers and pesticides makes the price of agricultural products subject to fluctuations in the oil market.

Think about that.

3597 2018-05-07 17:08:47 Erm ppl seem to be talking of multiple rigs and 2nd #USOP drilling running. Bit overzealous interpretation of the term "back to back" in my original posting. With a grasp of English, back to back means just that, otherwise it would've read as "tandem" or such.

3604 2018-05-07 17:08:14 The Romans used to clean themselves with olive oil since they did not have any soap. They would pour the oil on their bodies, and then use a strigil, which is type of blade, to scrape off any dirt along with the oil
3605 2018-05-07 17:08:14 If Canadians lets the Christian Right and Corporate interests like Big Oil set policy then we might was well be living in Trumpland. Sullying hard fought for human rights and environmental protections seem to be priorities for UCP. The Great Undoing begins.

3607 2018-05-07 17:08:03 Oil prices are over $70 a barrel for first time since 2014 due to continued attacks from the Trump admin on the Iran Nuclear deal.  It’s clearly Trumps fault but curious to see how the spineless @gop tries to make this Obama’s fault, which it  isn’t.
3608 2018-05-07 17:07:38 I use suds from black soap and witch hazel as a toner and aloe vera for moisturizing.  I use tea tree oil for anti bacteria on new acne!!

3620 2018-05-07 17:06:12 Your erroneous allogation that an $ increase in crude oil would in any way be a benefit to Russia seems poorly thought out, since the USA is now the top oil producer. #AmericaFirst #MAGA

3625 2018-05-07 17:05:35   The reason for rising gas prices (oil, Propane) are the threat of WAR with Iran. It's sheer speculation with traders in the Stock Market driving up the prices. It's really shameful & hurting the average American

3629 2018-05-07 17:05:13 Why would I need a discount on something already invoiced? The work was done negligently and placed my life in danger by driving a car that was smoking and spewing oil until the exhaust caught on fire.
3630 2018-05-07 17:05:08 The economics drive it. The spread between #gas and #diesel needs to be pretty wide to make it work. With OPEC constraining the market, #oil prices should rise, spread should widen. Also #gas doesn’t have road taxes.

3653 2018-05-07 17:02:39 Also rosemary, thyme etc, we've had garden herbs even if spices were for the rich. I'm talking about modern day cooking. 

Though I do know that 50 years ago in yorkshire my mum had coconut oil. My grandpa used it for everything apparently.

3707 2018-05-07 16:58:08 Perhaps not taking money from the oil lobby for your elections would help. But since you're bought and paid for I doubt this will change anytime soon.

3709 2018-05-07 16:57:36 the only other factor that would change things is if these refineries move to more medium grade like Urals. That will have a knock on effect of demanding less light crude, which will affect shale oil

3715 2018-05-07 16:56:56 Why is US concerned about oil??
3716 2018-05-07 16:56:54 Now, its a perilously balanced jenga tower, and the protesters are targeting multiple weak points all at once. The banks (and by extension the currency), the nationalized industries such as mining and oil, even general strikes by entire markets. It is brilliantly executed.

3777 2018-05-07 16:47:47 The way a do it is... one randomly size thing of rice in the pan.  Small amount of oil turn on full mix till rice is a little see through. Then two amount of boiling water in the same randomly sized thing. Lid on. Turn off after 5-10 then go back to it after 20 to cooked rice.

3793 2018-05-07 16:46:07 Evangelicalz believe that wealth is proof of God's Grace. Evangelicals accept Republican donor class interpretation of Scripture as His Word because they have been chosen by Him to have dominion over the Red States, finance, and the oil industry.
3794 2018-05-07 16:46:00 Is it? So voting for a leader who doesn’t think Human Rights are important. Your argument is all about Oil. A Province can only get their product to their boarders. Kenney had a chance when he was in Ottawa and failed.
3795 2018-05-07 16:45:57 We must buy local refined oil. It will reduce dollar demand.

3804 2018-05-07 16:45:04 Republican responses are always just sad. Everything trump says is true, despite video evidence to the contrary. “Witch hunt”, “Fake news”, “Deep State”. This is just parroting trump’s stupidity. He is a snake oil salesman, and 40 percent of the country buys it.

3846 2018-05-07 16:40:06 The only SANCTION that can bring down the regime is TOTAL OIL EMBARGO. Short of that the regime will continue to cause harm to others and oppress Iranians.
3847 2018-05-07 16:39:56 Don’t be ridiculous we didn’t take their oil.

3868 2018-05-07 16:38:34 so much for "no good, will not be tolerated" higher oil prices barking towards OPEC,
none of these tactics makes sense which so far means get ready to pay a lot more this year for everything because Oil isnt going down with so much political support behind so much credit facility

3880 2018-05-07 16:36:49 This is not what the nation needs right now. As an oil producing nation,we cannot compare ourselves to most nations in eastern europe.
3881 2018-05-07 16:36:42 On Fox Biz News today @ 1:15. Tune in! Oil prices moving higher on potential Iranian sanctions being re-imposed. Problem for the markets? Not today clearly but it could be if it bleeds into inflation expectations not to mention the offset to the tax cuts for many.
3882 2018-05-07 16:36:35 I forget I have things to do when I’m agreeing to come on my off days  i been putting off an oil change for TOOO long !

Venezuela's problems were not caused by Marxism or socialism, just an over reliance on oil and interference from the US
3899 2018-05-07 16:33:37 we were good until they halted oil production to artificially drive the price of oil back up
3900 2018-05-07 16:33:37 I think shale oil is operated on autopilot as what is essentially a monetary reserve. Oil prepay (Enron-style tripartite debt/futures with a counterparty funder) is being used for (Closed) Market Operations to create what is essentially a Global Central Oil Bank #OOTT
3901 2018-05-07 16:33:36 Meanwhile, Alberta, which could use some oil alternatives, is one of the provinces most hoping to benefit from pot production.
3902 2018-05-07 16:33:35 And I need to proof read....
3903 2018-05-07 16:33:32 Oil would go even higher if he does not ax the Iran deal and Israel axes Iran's nuclear facilities and much of Iran's oil producing infrastructure.
3904 2018-05-07 16:33:23 i hate when a silver-tongued salesman rides his stage coach into town & waxes poetic about the curative properties of his latest miracle tonic, & i spend my hard-earned savings in an attempt to fix my various maladies, only to find that the snake oil has worsened my condition.

3906 2018-05-07 16:33:07 Don't want to be the smell police BUT  citronella causes UV sensitivity. I got a few bad burns before using it almost like a perfume after i got obsessed with it. Just be sure that anywhere you apply oil is fully covered, out of sun- not on your neck face forearms etc
3907 2018-05-07 16:32:58 Don't be ashamed. We are still here. That flag was in the shoulders of many brave men and women who made our country what is is today. We just have to stand up and let our "leaders" know we are awake!

3934 2018-05-07 16:30:23 It depends on when PIGB kicks in. Before PIGB is operational, they have no choice. CBN’s rate will apply.

After PIGB, ownership transfers to the oil companies and they can do whatever they want. I won’t be surprised if they insist on NAFEX.

3940 2018-05-07 16:29:36 IMHO the amount of single-use plastic could be effectively reduced when the stores stopp wrapping fresh (organic) food in plastic. The same applies for any other goods which were covered in multiple layers of mineral-oil-based materials. (1/2)
3941 2018-05-07 16:29:31 They are all people too just as NK or any other country the problem is not the people but them wanting to change our country to their cultures that if institutionalized will destroy our nation like oil and water shake it up it still seperates? We already have culture clash.

3956 2018-05-07 16:27:50 @yanisvaroufakis argued that the US actually had a hand in the rocketing oil prices of the '70s (while framing the Arabs). The logic being that expensive oil would harm America less than it would harm its European and Japanese competitors.

3964 2018-05-07 16:27:11 It was there but no one was watching. I have always said trump was nothing more than a snake oil salesman. In everything he said during the the campaign and since has absolutely no substance it’s always “we’ll see!”. Absolutely no substance
3965 2018-05-07 16:27:02 Rural Ireland already taxed; 2nd highest energy costs yet no solar tariff for farmers; 3rd highest car costs in a country without rural transport and Oil / diesel that's 60% duty with 90% imported, and no tax on oil extraction. That all cripples farmers and rural economies.

3999 2018-05-07 16:23:48 Long term trend is higher oil prices. Pin it to your fridge and call me back in two years time. I said same thing six months ago when oil was around 50.
4000 2018-05-07 16:23:35 I was in direct contact with the dealership on the civic the electrics kept going haywire but they said it was low oil or my driving style I had 5 breakdowns in 4 month.

4013 2018-05-07 16:21:53 The first week is the hardest, after you get over that hump the cravings are minimal. Juuls also have a higher concentration of nicotine than cigs. So you're only creating another addiction for yourself. The best thing to do is buy a vape, and get CBD oil. Worked wonders for me
4014 2018-05-07 16:21:37 2 end my moisturizing rant, I really really hate coconut oil. That stuff doesnt do anything for me hydration-wise. Don’t listen to twitter estheticians who tell you that coconut oil is the solution to everything, there are so many better oils (almond, jojoba, even baby oil)

4029 2018-05-07 16:20:16 All the vegetable spreads, cakes etc I've looked at contain palm oil, which is responsible for the loss of so much rainforest habitat and wildlife. It's in everything. Sodium laureth/lauryl sulphate is a palm oil product. It's in plastics, soaps, shampoos. :(

4035 2018-05-07 16:19:37 @Costco I was disappointed in your supplying items made from Palm oil. I went shopping yesterday and they were giving out samples of nature Valley bars with a main ingredient being palm oil.

4037 2018-05-07 16:19:28 Mainly it's to protect the painting. Also oil paints go dull after a while so applying a varnish brings them back to life.

4049 2018-05-07 16:18:40 Yea try saving up to buy one. You can get a good car for around $1600. It can be done but its not easy being on your own without one. While I was on my own one of my cars broke down cause of lack of oil then I had to save up for 4 months until I got another while on my own.

4067 2018-05-07 16:16:58 Name calling is rude for starters as you don't know me.  The first 2 years the province was in a recession. Oil prices helped the PC during those years to avoid deficit. And not looking after your assets is poor management.
4068 2018-05-07 16:16:53 The March 2018 U.S. #soybean crush set an all-time record, thereby reemphasizing the strength of total U.S. demand given Argentina’s reduced meal export prospects.

4108 2018-05-07 16:13:26 The only thing keeping the dollar from completely collapsing is that it is pegged to the oil trade. Once we move away from oil, the dollar will crash if we do not peg it to something else globally important. I can't imagine what that would be. There will be massive losses.

4124 2018-05-07 16:11:36 I think Giuliani has some important announcements to make on interest rates too, and I believe a few to make on oil drilling permits.

4127 2018-05-07 16:11:20 Nothing wrong with the Iran deal..just people with $$$ in their eyes see a problem.
Who are America to tell Iran how to trade it's oil..fuck the petro $.and stop warmongering
4128 2018-05-07 16:11:19 They are either snake oil peddling  liars or in serious need of mental help for their delusions.

4131 2018-05-07 16:11:00 I need someone to come to me and put oil in this bike

4133 2018-05-07 16:10:55 Out Waldorf getting an oil change. Somebody come scoop me and let’s go get lunch
4134 2018-05-07 16:10:54 It was probably petroleum jelly or vegetable oil not motor oil.
4135 2018-05-07 16:10:53 No. You're not a doctor and homeopathy is 18th century snake oil. Stop harming patients.
4136 2018-05-07 16:10:52 I’m definitely gonna use them all this coming weekend but just so y’all know, a few fire items 

1. NARS Natural Radiance Foundation
2. Sol de Janiero Glow Oil 
3. Eylure Lashes 
4. STELLAR setting powder
4137 2018-05-07 16:10:50 Except the cow that was killed to make the burger. Or the plants that the cow ate, to turn into the burger. Or the dinosaur that died millions of years ago to become oil to become fuel to transport and cook the mea....... ah hell, was it good?
4138 2018-05-07 16:10:46 I brought my car in for an oil change and it turns out I need service AND my antenna got recalled. This might be a long afternoon at Mom’s. The only bright side is that my oil change is complimentary.
4139 2018-05-07 16:10:45 Agree on the oil market comment. I left out that there have previously been environmental protests over drilling. But international politics can change sentiments. Anyway, I'm enjoying your YouTube and tweet content. Good work.
4140 2018-05-07 16:10:41 Got that oil change and washed my load
4141 2018-05-07 16:10:40 it's very meaty so would make a good one yes

weve just been slicing them up and eating with olive oil and salt, mozzarella. really reeaaallllly good

4143 2018-05-07 16:10:34 So true  and costs are increasing  especially healthcare GOP really mess that up .  gas prices going up to help big oil Ceo's , but  jobs for regular folks  are always temporary oil is boom and bust always has been.

4145 2018-05-07 16:10:29 Another surge that has zero to do with supply and demand. We also have a stupid OPEC meeting next month, and if the deal's 180 day clause is in effect, the dumb dumbs have more reason to be dumb. None of this has anything to do with oil. Can't wait till these morons lose.
4146 2018-05-07 16:10:27 You mean to say that it's the oil business! The cause of genocides of Hindus all over the places?

4148 2018-05-07 16:10:17 My hair grew 3 inches in less than 3 months and it’s very thick. My advice is Jamaican castor oil and getting a curly trim (deva cut) and don’t comb your hair too much or use shampoo. Use co-was instead and use your fingers to detangle your hair.

4155 2018-05-07 16:09:26 Saline spray every 2-3hrs, coconut oil swabbed with q-tip inside nasals so they don't get too dry, benedryl kids chewables 
4156 2018-05-07 16:09:26 The idea that any of these people care about the Venezuelan people is absurd. They care about exploiting the oil they can't get their greedy hands on. Why aren't they crying a river over the people of Libya, Yemen, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria or Somalia? Unadulterated hypocrites!
4157 2018-05-07 16:09:10 Listened to most of Kunstler's podcast over the last decade; came for the civilization doomerism, but stayed for his urbanism takes. I forgive some of the hyperbole because a peak oil crisis seemed more plausible when that was written, but his takes haven't changed much today.
4158 2018-05-07 16:09:00 I hate shaving so much. I wonder what it’s like to shave and have no razor burn or ingrown hairs or irritation. No amount of coconut oil will save me.

4162 2018-05-07 16:08:43 I have to use antidandruff/tea tree oil shampoo because my scalp gets mad irritated because i only wash my hair twice a week. These photos were taken after using a redepositing product. Red is one of the fastest fading colors so no matter what i do, Issa mess.
4163 2018-05-07 16:08:33 Try peppermint oil and water (3 parts water and one part peppermint oil), mix and use in a sprayer, spraying where the cat usually gets in-or anywhere else :) Meeooooww!
4164 2018-05-07 16:08:29 Surprise. Dubai earns only 5% of its revenue from oil.

4169 2018-05-07 16:07:57 Team austerity looks strong anyway with sanctions, oil $60-80, GDP +0,5-1,5%, Timchenko/Rottenberg appetites strong as ever, and no meaningful structural reforms
4170 2018-05-07 16:07:47 GDP growth was slowing down even in 2013 (and was below the world's average) when oil was above $90, the answer is not oil, the answer is more competition in the economy, which you cannot achieve without competition in politics.
4171 2018-05-07 16:07:33 My husband is done being upset about that. Now he pesters me about changing my awful wipers or not changing my oil right on time lol

4184 2018-05-07 16:05:56 Oil popped all over my arm while cooking and OH MY GOSH, it hurts so much!
4185 2018-05-07 16:05:42 Oil has passed $70 a barrel. The global demand has grown by over 4Mb/d in the past 4 years. Companies holding back investments into new projects due to political uncertainties will put pressure on supply long term. 
We might be in for high prices for a while...
4186 2018-05-07 16:05:41 Kesian org yg delusional thinking that after the opposition wins no more gst, toll will be demolished, no more corruption and oil price will be controlled. But yeah still gonna vote for the opposition coz we do need a change.

4192 2018-05-07 16:05:03 It’s time to baste it in olive oil and put it out in the sun for four hours. 
4193 2018-05-07 16:05:01 I'm really keen to see how Ferrari perform this weekend after the Mercedes and Red Bull claimed that they top-up oil for qualifying. This has now been stopped. The two teams will definitely be watching like hawks.
4194 2018-05-07 16:04:58 Are we gonna start a two front war with Iran and Venezuela? Just like Hitler. The problems in Venezuela are US made. Our greed for oil and banking control know no bounds. This all started over KBR trying to take over their water BEFORE Chavez nationalized the oil fields.
4195 2018-05-07 16:04:57 by raping Americans There is a surplus of oil We the People know it You are stealing from Americans to make them dependent on govt
4196 2018-05-07 16:04:44 @rihanna  I'm applying oil to my edges before you show up to the Met. #MetMonday #MetBall
4197 2018-05-07 16:04:43 Yes you do, oil prices and gasoline prices have doubled, thought you would get involved.  Quit worrying about the storm, worry about small business!  We cannot stand a 100% increase in fuel costs.
4198 2018-05-07 16:04:41 Watch for Trump to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal, oil to spike (mid-$80s range) going into busy summer driving season, Democrats make high gas prices become election issue in Nov midterm elections.
4199 2018-05-07 16:04:39 Coconut oil is trash
4200 2018-05-07 16:04:31 Sweden  is socialist too, but no oil wealth and cold as Hell.  How is it Sweden got rich and fellow socialist Venezuela  is poor as ever?

I guess if you smell of snake oil, people don’t trust you. 
4202 2018-05-07 16:04:05 I just told Al! put peppermint on the base of your neck twice a day! Or in a vegetable capsule use lemon lavender and peppermint with olive oil. The more drops the longer it’ll last

4204 2018-05-07 16:04:03 Vitamin E oil not the thick one the target brand is actually really good make sure it’s 100%. Could mix it with 2 drops of 100% tea tree oil & rub into your face like you washing your face then rince off & wash again like you regularly do.
4205 2018-05-07 16:03:58 Rhianna’s body lava is $69 i think tf not for some sparkly oil
4206 2018-05-07 16:03:58 its because of oil
4207 2018-05-07 16:03:54 I constantly wonder what kinds of typical messes end up on your body at other jobs! At CFA it's usually sweet tea spills or peanut oil splash up.
4208 2018-05-07 16:03:42 Maybe the problem is diesel. Would be nice to see GOP and oil/manufcaturing admit it’s bad and work toward electric rather than deny, lie and fight basic science for profit. That’s why I fight Republicans tooth and nail.
4209 2018-05-07 16:03:41 And the courts (not the Government) are a neutral body which can look at all the sides, listen to the evidence, and come to a verdict. When parents are in a situation like this, they are vulnerable to snake oil salespersons who want to use a child for their own agenda
4210 2018-05-07 16:03:35 ...is made from oil money

4212 2018-05-07 16:03:21 Toppling cigs company, oil pollution human harm & misery political conditioning gov stability policies, mundane but also day to day stricture that amounts.
4213 2018-05-07 16:03:16 The last one is pretty likely to happen and may even happen next year if oil stays above $70 and agriculture exports continue to rise. It’s sixth now, so only needs to leapfrog Germany. Life expectancy doable on current trends. Not sure about halving poverty.

4218 2018-05-07 16:02:49 Oil tops $70 for the first time since 2014 as investors await U.S. decision on Iran 
Whatever the U.S. decision there is an over-supply of oil in the market. this $70 price is fake news.

4265 2018-05-07 15:58:33 Yes, it is... what are they called? Ethanol plants do not get payments, let alone from oil companies in the form of a tax.

4293 2018-05-07 15:56:15 Im a license nature hair stylist. Let me hip y’all to something. Coconut oil isn’t a moisturizer for hair. . The proper use for it is a pre wash. Wet the hair, apply melted oil to wet hair, cover and let it sit. Then shampoo it out. It’s like a natural protein treatment.
4294 2018-05-07 15:56:12 Thanks to your boss there could be a oil rig just off shore pretty soon.  Enjoy the beach while you can.

4326 2018-05-07 15:52:42 Crude oil is a double edged sword.  It creates a great late cycle opportunity;  however the inflationary seeds sown carry the causation for the next large bear market;  in due course.

4381 2018-05-07 15:45:54 I have been bullish on crude oil since near the 50 level,  and am still strongly bullish.  The consensus has been,  and still is,  US shale supply would meet demand,  keeping Oil at or even below 50.  Many hedgers,  desiring survival,  hedged at 50.  They were,  and are wrong.

KINDLY SPEAK SENSE

4395 2018-05-07 15:44:25 I would rather get a Lada (I am sending a couple to Europe on my next trip to Ukraine) for $1000 and replace the tranny for $500 and have it run for 100k mi than $25,000 on something that needs regular oil changes and services in "authorised service stations only" lmao
4396 2018-05-07 15:44:25 @TheBradBlog In the summer of 1968 (August?) the oil industry took out a full page ad in the L.A. Times inside the first section saying the only way to stop the return of Ice Age would be to burn more oil. Proof they knew about the effects of CO2. Find it!

4409 2018-05-07 15:43:21 Alberta would never have gotten “off track” had the shortsighted PC’s not stopped saving some of the oil royalty income for when it was really needed. They inexplicably stopped saving in the late 1980s. Another one of their terrible decisions!
4410 2018-05-07 15:42:53 No sir it's oil! It's the prime reason for suffering by Iranians, oil has lead them to this situation. Religion with rigorous doctrine was introduced to control people will as a fallout from oil ownership struggle.

4437 2018-05-07 15:39:40 frankly I am skeptical of every system of “fixing yourself” and all of them are snake oil. the Parsons guy talked me out of something that was giving me a heart condition and I’m grateful for that.
4438 2018-05-07 15:39:28 Even i can feel the effects of the oil price hike. Man, last year, XCS costs around Php 45/46. But now, it costs around 55/56.

4450 2018-05-07 15:37:27 For soup, cook sliced ginger in oil, then simmer with beans, garlic, mushroom broth and celery. Top with olive oil.
4451 2018-05-07 15:36:58 maybe $80 oil will make the mouth breathers take notice.

4478 2018-05-07 15:33:50 While I may not always agree with him, I respect and love Juan Williams.  Juan - the only aspect of the Iran Deal was allowing the USA to export Oil which has contributed to keeping global Oil prices down. True.

4528 2018-05-07 15:29:21 Who says there isn't a group who control everything - vanilla price rises as we eat ice cream in the summer, crude oil price rise - just as holidays approach, gas prices rise before winter.
4529 2018-05-07 15:29:17 I got my license during "The Gas Wars"...used to cost $5.00 A TANK.  And not one of these wussy little tanks we've got today, but an 18 GALLON tank!  That car never shut off longer than it needed for an oil change, then.  d;o)
4530 2018-05-07 15:29:10 Will be interesting to compare the actual trading of underlying assets such as uranium, gold, silver and oil to that of bitcoin as far as daily trading volumes go in terms of $$. Makes sense to own much of the underlying asset if you want to effect massive price change.
4531 2018-05-07 15:28:59 Oh, I remember it well! In the 70's, 2 hour queues at the pumps, fights on the forecourt, rationed amounts. That was the Middle East oil crisis, but also been several strike or protest driven shortages more recently than that! It happens and I'm sure it will again.

US strategy is to control Russia with lower oil prices.

4570 2018-05-07 15:25:39 I dread thinking of the cost of maintaince from just the cost of fuel. If you're American, or anywhere where large amounts of crude oil is extracted, it's more expensive. Comparable to Europe.
4571 2018-05-07 15:25:37 What the hell do you expect him to do, demand the volcano stop spewing lava? Were you this demanding when the oil explosion happened in 2010 and Obama spent 86 days in a fetal position helpless? At least be consistent and honest.

4594 2018-05-07 15:23:21 I remembered her habit of leaving washing up in the sink for days, the horrible rancid smell from the shit she eats, and looked at the stains on the walls she never cleans off from cooking using palm oil and a fuckton of onions and garlic.

And said nothing.

4657 2018-05-07 15:15:59 They've increased across the country, thanks to trump coddling BIG oil.
4658 2018-05-07 15:15:54 Did they start to flower yet? If they haven't been sprayed or flowered they're edible. You clean them,boil them and freeze them. Then when you want to eat them, cook with some olive oil, onion and pancetta in a pan Very good and lots of iron in them. And yes, I'm serious.
4659 2018-05-07 15:15:52 Know your history!! Our involvement in Iran via oil industry lobbying probably got us where we are today with Iran. We overthrew a moderate government for the love of money and allowed dictatorial rule which is fodder for extremists and/or revolt.
4660 2018-05-07 15:15:52 Yup, same way you use coconut oil to cook and do hair stuff. It’s basically carrot oil and it’s edible too.
4661 2018-05-07 15:15:37 Taking pixie to the car shop for an oil change and other things. Sounds like I’m about to blow a bag 
4662 2018-05-07 15:15:32 I need to go get so much shit done to my car. I’ve been neglecting it... I need one of my headlights fixed, oil changed & tire pressure checked. Help
4663 2018-05-07 15:15:32 You seem to have also forgotten that Bush brought our economy to its knees before leaving office to take up oil painting.
4664 2018-05-07 15:15:29 What's pushing up the price of oil? Um speculation.
4665 2018-05-07 15:15:29 Waryono oil?
4666 2018-05-07 15:15:27 @Derpybearr Oh no! Well, we're here for you if you ever need a car wash or an oil change!

Recruit social media influencers outside of state/law enforcement

Get DPW/private haulers involved

4681 2018-05-07 15:14:16 In order to cook Hong shao rou. First u must cut the meat into cubes like shape then u cook it with low heat and add sugar and oil into your frying pan and add shaoxing cooking wine, light and dark soysause and water. Then cook it for 45 mins then u can eat.
4682 2018-05-07 15:14:10 Environmentalists should be working to reduce the demand for oil not the supply. It is futile to try & reduce the supply that way as the demand will be from somewhere else.
4683 2018-05-07 15:14:06 You got that right ,we need to keep the oil and gas in Canada so we can have cheaper oil and gas.

4685 2018-05-07 15:13:58 For #oil demand distruction you need:
1- appreciating US dollar
2- declining govt expinditures
3- increasing real interest rates
4- declining disposable income 
5- increasing taxes 
Take your pick of any combination

4701 2018-05-07 15:12:28 Many will beg to differ on this. The bar was definitely very low for President Buhari. His job is to sell the Nigerian market and Nigerian goods to foreign markets. He should attempt to persuade America to buy Nigerian oil and should be reticent about allowing one way trade ....

So ONGC has lost lot of money of taxpayer but today its doing good, so credit goes to public & not to Congis
4711 2018-05-07 15:11:00 The only reason is their oil. It’s their oil not anyone else’s. No war or blood for oil.

4718 2018-05-07 15:10:27 how come oil was at 30$  in 2015 while sanctions were lifted in 2016.then oil should have broke 70$ price....crazy stats.

4734 2018-05-07 15:09:02 There are many types of oil and it seems it would depend on the amount / type of oil used. If it’s something safe for squirrels to ingest while cleaning / grooming the oil off themselves, then perhaps it might not be such a problem. Of course they could always not climb the pole.
4735 2018-05-07 15:09:00 The reason our gas prices are so high is because they say we get our oil from the LA pipeline which is expensive. I call bullshit but w/e

4744 2018-05-07 15:08:05 Propaganda! The oil companies refine 83-85 octane gasoline. Ethanol is cheap octane and is used to boost octane and as an oxygenate! It’s replaced toxic fuel additives like lead and MTBE!
4745 2018-05-07 15:07:56 At least it's not palm-kernel oil.

4754 2018-05-07 15:06:59 It is the world demand for oil & gas that drives the demand. Trying to reduce this demand by limiting production in Canada is futile as the demand will be supplied from somewhere else.

4801 2018-05-07 15:02:32 No, but hardly democratic yet Corbyn holds it up as a model of socialism.  The health service in Venezeula, makes the problems in the NHS look like trivia?  

Nor is there a free press in Caracas, & people living in dire poverty in a country sitting on more oil than Saudia Arabia

4810 2018-05-07 15:01:47 देखो, पेहली बार किसी सरकार ने सोचा है कि Oil Storage जरुरी है। इसके फायदे समझो। जब Oil prices कम होगी तब सरकार झरुरत से झ्यादा मात्रा में पेट्रोल खरीदेगी और store करेगी। जब भाव बढ जायेंगे तब यही store किया हुआ पेट्रोल use होगा।

4815 2018-05-07 15:01:31 After the oil filter was finally delivered, the rep rang up my nearly $100 bill. I showed him my $10 online coupon. He wouldn’t apply it, he said, because he was going to deduct $13.80 from my purchase. So they got an extra 30 minutes of my time, and I got a (net) $3.80 discount.
4816 2018-05-07 15:01:11 It would be an interesting play for them, being the largest producer of oil in the world. But certainly agree it is a possibility.

4830 2018-05-07 14:59:50 The Trump Administration's Labor Department is telling investment firms they have to invest in oil companies because to not do so could violate fiduciary responsibilities.
4831 2018-05-07 14:59:46 I don't know the source but "and" makes sense here.

Fractional distillation means we have a large amount of tailings to use up. (bottom half) It's dumped into consumer goods.

We subsidize the oil industry with consumption.
4832 2018-05-07 14:59:44 Took my car to the dealership for its first oil change, against my better judgement.

Should have gone with my gut on this one....
4833 2018-05-07 14:59:36 ‘Professionals’ as in the highly trained medical staff and nurses? Or are you including in this the courts as well? Snake oil anyone?
4834 2018-05-07 14:59:31 Classic example: look at palm oil researches in Indonesia. Most only tell you the benefits of palm oil and how the risk can be mitigated bcause most money is from the industry. There's already a preconceived notion that palm *must* be beneficial.

4843 2018-05-07 14:58:37 @KendallRaeOnYT also do you have just the cbd drops. I know you have the syrup and vape. but try rubbing a few drops of the oil straight on where you’re feeling the pain.
4844 2018-05-07 14:58:30 It depends whether you want to use it recreationally or medicinally, btw cannabinoids can be taken by many administrative methods like orally (edibles, concentrated cannabis oil), sublingualy, rectal administration,  smoking, topically and transdermal skin patches.

4901 2018-05-07 14:54:03 For the O&G sector this is good, for the consumer,  this is terrible. Considering we buy a lot of light oil and refined products from  the U.S., we have terrible purchasing power with a weak dollar.

Growth in oil production, refining, sales offsets lower retail spending.  All irrelevant. Fed will continue bloodletting via "normalization"

4937 2018-05-07 14:50:43 The rest of the world needs oil to fuel their economies - the only country that is deliberately going backwards is Canada - the energy from carbon is necessary for progress.
4938 2018-05-07 14:50:40 You know how you're cooking and a little bit of oil splashes on your arm? Multiply that x a million....

4941 2018-05-07 14:50:32 Exactly bro! Without generators Nigerian won't buy fuel as much and we know how many people are wealthy in this country as a result of crude oil

4943 2018-05-07 14:50:32 I hate when cis men that look for women that know how to the heteronormative things as a male, like changing oil! Like that's cool and all but just because Sharen knows how to change oil doesn't make her a great person John.
4944 2018-05-07 14:50:30 No idea. Has a oil leak, sway bar is out of line or broken, inspection, O2 sensor, and a mysterious metal grinding noise. I might as well buy a new car if I had the money.

4946 2018-05-07 14:50:21 The oil and gas Cartel is now blatantly robbing motorists. A 15 Rand Liter of Fuel should be illegal in this day and age... Why is the fuel price regulated again? Posing this question to those who call for deregulation of Electricity because it's "anti-competitive" price wise.
4947 2018-05-07 14:50:20 Guess I’ll get the kids ready to hit the streets I gotta get a oil change and show my baby daddy some stuff
4948 2018-05-07 14:50:15 The Iranian oil industry will continue to develop even if the United States pulls out of the 2015 #Iran nuclear deal, and #Tehran would see the accord as operational as long as it can sell oil, the #Oil Ministry website quoted senior officials as saying on Monday.

4950 2018-05-07 14:50:08 @Trees_Eyes there’s different forms of cbd. From the link I sent you I take the first starter package. It comes with an AM oil for the morning. A PM oil for the evening. A bottle of cbd capsules. I take one of those a day. It also comes with cbd energy chocolate.
4951 2018-05-07 14:50:01 Norway nationalized its oil industry before it was cool. I'd be hard pressed to point to which of Venezuela and Norway is the most "socialist", but it's pretty clear to see which country has been managed better, in terms of optimizing social justice, freedom, growth.

4955 2018-05-07 14:49:50 I wanna try make that baby spinach truffle salad that they have at nobu and a few other restaurants.. is it just spinach and truffle oil and Parmesan cheese or are there other ingredients???
4956 2018-05-07 14:49:46 Rising oil prices have gone unchecked with this President.  Why?
After his trip to Saudi Arabia prices started climbing
If he pulls back from the Iran Deal oil will rise beyond $80 per barrel
Tariffs causing rising prices

Trumps plan is make Americans pay for his programs
4957 2018-05-07 14:49:38 We do the same.  A few squirts of olive oil cooking spray  spread up and down the pole will do the trick. 
4958 2018-05-07 14:49:36 Before dumping the #citizenshipamendmentbill on Assam, I urge the govt. and the rest of India to close their eyes & think about tea that breaks India's slumber, her oil that runs half the country & her natural resource that makes every Indian proud. These will be no more soon.

4962 2018-05-07 14:49:14 Venezuela still has 60% of its employees and 70%(!) of its GDP from the private sector. Apparently it's socialist because the country nationalized some of the oil industry.

It started ‘round 1951 when Kermit Roosevelt led the CIA into Iran to help Britain overthrow Iranians who wanted to reclaim their own oil fields. Then US installed corrupt Shah.

4979 2018-05-07 14:47:29 Except it’s already difficult to get our oil out of the ground and forcing companies to pay more taxes and follow more regulations makes it harder for them to compete against places with lower taxes and regulations globally, because inter provincial taxes differences don’t matter

4989 2018-05-07 14:46:36 Big oil was freezing out alaskans by sending the gas to Asia. This independent producer did a deal to sell their gas to Anchorage at market price in trade for a free pipeline. Exxon paid this independent off to stop drilling in Alaska or face trouble.

4995 2018-05-07 14:45:53 I’m ready to waterboard the senate democrats so the President’s appointments can go through. I’d start with RINO neverT-Mitch for not going nuclear by now. Schumer, Pelosi & Schiflessleaker would be next. I think I’d use olive oil with Schiflessleaker.
4996 2018-05-07 14:45:50 We need to call him the Trump Whisperer. Between Giuliani and Trump, they're going to drive us all crazy . . . just total looney tunes. I'd say and merry melodies, but there's nothing merry about their   convoluted BS. Neither is any better than snake oil salesmen.

5030 2018-05-07 14:42:30 Why does that help you? It helps bring regional stability for the Afrikans, Arabs or Europeans living on that continent. Helps secure the routes of trade! Helps to increase safe supplies of oil, timber, coca, to USA industry, helps Afrikan nation's with industries, water...

5037 2018-05-07 14:41:42 Whats so incredible about this?

The hated & medieval Saudi junta was installed by TE Lawrence, and armed by NATO ever since, as a mere titular head of Standard Oil's (now Aramco) 300blln barrels of oil in Arabia.

The Saudis dont even fart without prior approval
5038 2018-05-07 14:41:29 oil pan, youre done. oh im about to take a sloppy sloppy oil shower
5039 2018-05-07 14:41:18 Demand destruction takes time, of course other than government rationing etc. I think fundamental constraint/cap (peak affordability) is the secular decline in oil EROEI. I suspect Saudi would not be IPO'ing Aramco if they did not agree
5040 2018-05-07 14:41:13 Actually I do. I have many sources independent of each other in the oil and gas industry who have gave similar accounts of this. Look it up. 
“SA pumping water.”
“SA Aramco’s IPO problems”
“Slant drilling in Yemen”
Believe what you want, but the evidence is there.
5041 2018-05-07 14:41:11 The price of oil is up recently and trending higher. So we’re subsidizing @AstanaTeam at the pumps, like it or not. We won’t even get a mug like the one I got from @Ride_Argyle.  #procycling

5046 2018-05-07 14:40:51 Disagree about Notley strategy slowing down energy transition, which will proceed at the pace that new technology develops, not at a pace dictated by the old technology. The new is electric vehicles. Eventually EVs will displace oil. Until then, AB will produce oil.

Untuk oil tu you boleh experiment sendiri cara yang mana works best for you. Few ways :
1) Moisturizer, followed by oil
2) Mix them together
3) Oil, followed by moisturizer

5052 2018-05-07 14:40:25 The date went well and we had a delicious meal that I prepared. Edamame spaghetti with grilled shrimp. Used a green chili olive oil and pineapple balsamic on the shrimp so they were sweet and spicy.

5055 2018-05-07 14:40:09 That's why she was chosen. So they could make an example out of her, paint her with a large brush, & remove her from power

She was fighting against the oil industry & big government as governor

She was allowing an independent oil company to drill & big oil don't want to share
5056 2018-05-07 14:40:08 So... Trump's bluster over the Iran Treaty has driven oil prices to $70 bbl. and we're seeing pump prices above $3, and they could go as high as $4. #toomuchwinning #makingAmericapooragain
5057 2018-05-07 14:39:50 I was just reading @Vishen Lakhiani's book Code of the Extraordinary Mind last week and he swore by @bulletproofexec's coconut oil coffee in the bulletproof diet. Never heard of the idea before, but I'll give it a shot. Let me know how you like it :)

5066 2018-05-07 14:38:37 The only long term answer is to reduce demand for oil, which means driving fuel efficient cars. Unfortunately, the lower gas prices had the opposite effect, which has increased demand for gas guzzlers which in turn will increase demand for oil. Too bad Trump is stupid.

5069 2018-05-07 14:38:29 And since these wild fish are very small, a lot of them need to be harvested for a bottle of fish oil supplements. On the other hand, these wild fish are also supply constrained, so increasing demand for them wont increase as much supply as one might expect.

5122 2018-05-07 14:32:08 The supply of American Oil has only lowered global prices temporarily, as our demand is now catching up. The Saudis still continued to rake in money with the price drop, albeit not as much but still profitable. Unlike Russia and Venezuela, their oil sector is managed efficiently.

That’s why no exchange will host the Aramco IPO b/c they know they are drilling mostly water at this point. Yemen has untapped oil.

5218 2018-05-07 14:23:41 You're supposed to use them by mixing them up in regular massage oil, just a few drops of the essential oils. It needs to be diluted!
5219 2018-05-07 14:23:36 @realDonaldTrump If we are becoming energy independent why is OPEC still controlling pricing? American oil should be mitigating. It’s going to KILL growth. @FoxBusiness @seanhannity

5228 2018-05-07 14:21:52 I remember the odd even gas days of the 70s. Clearly we remain beholden to auto makers and the big Oil. Little has changed. Mpg remains in the low 20s.

5262 2018-05-07 14:18:47 Huey so sorry about your hearing. I have the same thing. I find that dabbing purest of Frankincense essential oil behind my ear and in front three times a day about half hour apart diminishes the ringing. It will come back just do it again.

5284 2018-05-07 14:16:31 Exactly. That, and pure guar gum, carrageenan, hydrogenated palm kernel oil, corn syrup, dextrin, gum acacia, and a few other sticky things. We call those "confidence builders"!
5285 2018-05-07 14:16:25 Monday off - which never happens. Going to try and change a headlight on my truck and oil change. All the adulting. I hope everyone has a killer day, surrounded by all the positive vibes. 
5286 2018-05-07 14:16:24 They got stuff using $$$ from the Islamist ME princes who were sympathetic to their cause. They got their money from us buying oil. Instead of demanding we switch to all hybrid/evs after 9/11, the answer was domestic drilling. Unfortunately, that doesn't work in a global market.
5287 2018-05-07 14:16:21 Thank you for your service. There was only ONE Gulf War. First U.S. declared since WWII. No one knows what (oil) the second and continuing engagements (oil) are for (oil).
What we DO know is that either they REALLY fucked you up, or took advantage of your stupendous nihilism.
5288 2018-05-07 14:16:18 No we don't cos WM squandered the oil Reserves, unlike Norway
5289 2018-05-07 14:16:11 What does a "positive outlook" mean for the oil market?
Higher or lower prices?

5291 2018-05-07 14:16:02 Do you know anything about history? Do you know what the CIA and the Brits did to Iran? They conspired and eliminated a democratically elected leader in Iran and installed the puppet Shah to get cheap oil. We made the mess. We did. Study up will ya?

5310 2018-05-07 14:13:59 Curious as to how much is purchased overseas as opposed to here. I assumed we were using our oil to refine now. Should be cheaper if this is the case. Imho 
5311 2018-05-07 14:13:50 The same place all governments get their money, by forcibly redistributing wealth from the people and land. Whether it is taxing oil exports or personal earnings. Governments have been doing exactly this for thousands of years.

5324 2018-05-07 14:12:20 ALSO... #ethanol blended gasoline saved consumers $306 per household. This estimate is conservative, as it excludes the additional aggregate cost savings that result from ethanol’s extension of the U.S. fuel supply and displacement of crude oil demand.

5332 2018-05-07 14:11:31 You idiot. You are causing oil (gas prices) to go up punishing the American people because you listen to Israel/Saudi too much.  Iran deal allows inspectors, allows trade. KEEP OIL PRICES LOW.

5346 2018-05-07 14:10:36 Try the Scot govt website. Best place to start. Deficit clearly outlined there. We get tax from oil. Low price and high extraction costs mean income from it is low.
5347 2018-05-07 14:10:36 Why supply worries?  The damn billionaires sheiks just shut the damn oil in! There is no freaking shortage! Just screw consumers! Where is the concern for working slaves who will be driven further into debt?

5355 2018-05-07 14:09:58 You know it’s bad when a oil change place talks mad shit about another place that does the same thing, but the other place rips off their customers.
5356 2018-05-07 14:09:47 I'm over here drinking a gallon of water a day, pouring coconut oil on everything, minding my own business, and my skin still isn't clear

5386 2018-05-07 14:07:01 He's right about what he says.  The problem with the left is that they don't want practical solutions.  They always want to force radical change.  "It's time!" they always say.  No, it will be time when the technology and infrastructure is in place and we phase out oil slowly.
5387 2018-05-07 14:06:50 Yes babe it works wonders and I think I will forever using the oil
5388 2018-05-07 14:06:45 The mass monoculture of palm oil is destroying masses of land which used to be forest. Similarly i get your point @Abdulla_Adam that we need to stop wasteful consumption. Drinking from a cup or a glass without a straw or washing the utensils does not make one primitive
5389 2018-05-07 14:06:31 You really believe that? An oil exporting nation is propped up by London? Right

5401 2018-05-07 14:05:31 In 2017, global oil demand grew faster than the increases in global oil supply, by ~400,000 barrels / day.  That reduced inventories and led to the higher prices now.  Though a very major producer, US oil & gasoline prices are still strongly impacted by events in other countries.

5403 2018-05-07 14:05:24 Yes! Squalane is awesome for dry skin. But I especially recommend sweet almond oil for oily, acne prone skin. Grapeseed oil and sunflower oil too are great for oily, acne prone skin.

5405 2018-05-07 14:05:04 There it is. Oil is over $70 a barrel for the first time since 2014 and gas prices are rising right in time for summer. Are any conservatives going to blame @realDonaldTrump? Nope. They will continue to slurp his BS.

5429 2018-05-07 14:03:05 Right. Plus oil over $70/bbl so gas prices go way up. My merit "raise" this year is already spent and I'll have less purchasing power than I did last year.

5482 2018-05-07 13:58:58 Game is so on between snake oil greasy, Giuliani and stealth-suave Avenatti! Popcorn ready. Law skool 101; have the facts ready to launch!
5483 2018-05-07 13:58:37 @animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
5484 2018-05-07 13:58:31 Charcoal is used as fuel, why do oil rich nations need to use such a primitive source of energy?
5485 2018-05-07 13:58:20 Someone invent an app where they come to your home and give you an oil change. 
5486 2018-05-07 13:58:20 whoever has my voodoo doll, please put me face down in a tsp of olive oil

5491 2018-05-07 13:57:49 Yes not to us but sky loves oil money
5492 2018-05-07 13:57:47 Yep. Oil your scalp love, every night. Try Silky Touch. It has helped me keep my hair soft and manageable. You can find it at clicks for less than R20 if you don't use it already. 
5493 2018-05-07 13:57:40 I would have to ask @Micronutris but these one are like "dried" with spices. No extra oil.
5494 2018-05-07 13:57:38 Stocks Extend Advance as Oil Climbs With Dollar /articles/2018-05-06/asian-stocks-set-to-advance-dollar-holds-steady-markets-wrap
5495 2018-05-07 13:57:27 I like the idea of not relying on oil for energy, but not because of global warming, global cooling, climate change, polar bears, sky is falling, etc. The earth has always gone through changes over millions of years. For the short time we've been monitoring, its just weather.
5496 2018-05-07 13:57:05 Did you use baby oil??
5497 2018-05-07 13:57:03 OIL
5498 2018-05-07 13:56:58 I need:

A facial.
A nap.
An oil change.
$3 million.
A fine Malbec.
A trip to St. Lucia. 
A date with Lenny Kravitz.
A do-over button.
And a massage therapist who enjoys a challenge.

Not necessarily in that order.

5502 2018-05-07 13:56:44 @jvedmond Kesam rolls:
300 ml lukewarm water
100 ml kesam (or sour cream/other)

25 grams yeast
2 tbsp oil
1 tsp salt
450-500 grams plain flour
Egg for brushing
Sesame seeds
5503 2018-05-07 13:56:40 Just googled "can you overdose on olbas oil". Yes, I am a doctor.
5504 2018-05-07 13:56:35 You are talking about hedonic adjustment and that is the idea but to produce a long time series impossible also you need to account for efficiency, eg if you measure the price of oil in units usuable work rather than volume it has fallen roughly 75% since the late 70s

5515 2018-05-07 13:55:22 Came in for a simple oil change, leaving with new parts and way less money
5516 2018-05-07 13:55:22 oh I plan on seizing the day, but more like an engine ran without oil kinds seize. Or maybe like an epileptic fit kinda seize.
5517 2018-05-07 13:55:11 So Great for Families that would be driving to a vacation destination this summer and for those that it will not be cost effective as Oil Prices are rising and the Price at the pump has gone up in Florida .21cents in 3 days. Thanks @realDonaldTrump Your spending attack time wrong

5524 2018-05-07 13:54:11 You are true but at the same time lets not foget that it was US and UK that figured out Shah is becoming too big and toi dangerous for them and will be harder to get free oil from Iran and brought Mullahs. No way Mullahs could gain power without US support.
5525 2018-05-07 13:54:09 Boiling oil while frying, then splashing onto my skin.
Scars appeared what a magical sensation. 
5526 2018-05-07 13:54:07 Oil prices have been climbing partly due to expectations that T-rump will abandon the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, that allowed Iran to export more crude. Restoring sanctions on Iran could affect as many as 1 million barrels per day of crude supply.  But who actually benefits...Russia
5527 2018-05-07 13:54:06 Usually we will advise on treating acne first using Tea Tree Oil Range. For scars, you can use Vitamin E Cream 1000iu as spot treatment.
5528 2018-05-07 13:53:53 Thought I’d avoid the weekend crowd and get @jiffylube to change my oil this morning. Mine is the only car here, but halfway through the process the Jiffy boys tell me they’re all out of oil filters for my Honda. So now I’m stuck. Thanks, @jiffylube!

5536 2018-05-07 13:53:08 For every tanker car hauling oil, it represents $4600 of lost government revenue.  I would rather see the addiction services, mental health services, health care, infrastructure, shelter and food for the poor and jobs.
5537 2018-05-07 13:53:04 The oil rise

5545 2018-05-07 13:52:30 Hawaii will have 100% renewable energy by 2045. It's a law. But other states that try to make that kind of commitment get undermined by the nuclear industry. Same kind of lies, same tactics as tobacco or big oil. It's really all the same fight.
5546 2018-05-07 13:52:14 Completely agree....and yet Brent/BFOE futures market tail wags physical market dog. Rise from 1st July 2017 of $30/bbl was accompanied (caused?) by 1.4m contract oil/product #BigLong 'fund' positions mainly down the curve

And now Salman & Netanyahu wants USA to go to War against Shiite Iran & pay for it too ? Why not do it themselves ?

5558 2018-05-07 13:50:54 It's still doing fine because it's not solely reliant on oil and, even per the worldbank, exercised prudent macroeconomic policy in running surpluses even while moving toward egalitarianism.

5561 2018-05-07 13:50:49 Oil is limited supply. Imagine knowing your fate rests on a resource we’re burning every day.

5564 2018-05-07 13:50:25 another day.High gas at the pump,higher oil price and a lower CDN dollar. The Trudeau liberals must be proud. Incompetent politico.

5568 2018-05-07 13:50:07 I knew Tories sold prisons, NHS buildings & land, NHS services, Scottish Oil etc & Health insurance scam. I had NO IDEA they're selling the Police Force too!

If @PoliceScotland are against the latter I think they will be very pleased with the massive public support they'll get.

5575 2018-05-07 13:49:31 Already called customer service and was basically told I was shit outta luck.  Chevy knows there a problem with equinoxes consuming oil, and leading to other costly repairs, but does nothing about it. Does my family need to get in an accident  before they do?

5577 2018-05-07 13:49:26 Was listening to a podcast with John Michael Greer and he said oil (and thus electricity) gives us all the equivalent of 300 slaves every day. Water, food, transportation, comfort. We're all fish & fossil fuels are our water.

5593 2018-05-07 13:47:32 Apparently, Ford executives are not paying attention to the continuous rise in oil prices.  Soon, the demand for fuel-efficient small or midsize sedans will take over and thus drive Ford into bankruptcy.
5594 2018-05-07 13:47:11 There is a fully intact Roman wine bottle sitting in Germany from the year 350 AD. It's fully drinkable but the Romans added a significant amount of thick olive oil as a preservative.

5601 2018-05-07 13:46:31 Thank you! Can either of you forsee it being an issue that it has old gas in it from last season..... and also was outside in the shed with oil in it... all winter.

5606 2018-05-07 13:46:14 Oil seems to be increasing in price daily. It is now over $75 a barrel as of today.  I wonder how they'll spin the Too Wee, Too Poor shite now.

5610 2018-05-07 13:45:54 Yes. We'll see how Trump's small base likes paying $5.00 a gallon for gas again for their Pickup Trucks! Oil is now over $70 a barrel. First time since 2014 it's been that high. Good thing unemployment is low with people working 2 and 3 jobs to get by.

5618 2018-05-07 13:45:10 It's merely conjecture. But imagine a state enjoying a positive terms of trade shock (e.g. higher oil prices in Texas). It draws investment from other states, tightening its labor market but contributing to slack in others.
5619 2018-05-07 13:45:08 I've already sold atleast 10 bottles of growth oil you hooker be patient.

5703 2018-05-07 13:36:38 Demand hasn't been static as developing countries increase their demand. But prices have been rising recently, partly, out of fears from a Middle East intervention between Iran and US. If that deal fails, sanctions could return to Iran hurting oil production.

5758 2018-05-07 13:31:40 That's a lazy explanation. Why did imperialism take so long to sink it's teeth in? Venezuela was doing relatively well for a while. The failure of the oil industry is definitely something that can be laid at the feet of the government.

5766 2018-05-07 13:30:34 OIL 15M WATCH this test of 50MA to hold above & bounce higher as consolidation level continues this morning. Good entry long pending.  UWT ?
5767 2018-05-07 13:30:26 終わ
5768 2018-05-07 13:30:19 This is mostly a function of oil prices not improvement in or diversification of the economy.
5769 2018-05-07 13:30:05 he say the A for Bodak Yellow de the “..dak” for the title inside. Man if you don’t get the snake oil philosopher off my screen...
5770 2018-05-07 13:30:02 แวร์?
5771 2018-05-07 13:29:57 The media is going with “Iran Deal” as useless oil narrative.  May I direct you to export demand, DEC18/DEC19 WTI at $6.25 backwardated, the opening of Saudi movie theaters and the Brent premium? #oilandgas
5772 2018-05-07 13:29:57 nothing upsets me like seeing people posting pictures of their 'tan lines' i.e. SUNBURN, there is nothing cool about sunburn...put your cooking oil away and get your factor 30 out #skincancerisnotcool
5773 2018-05-07 13:29:42 Nigga they been drilling oil in the gulf since  before our time
5774 2018-05-07 13:29:40 Who's Watching TOTGA ? ako lang ba naka Relate dun sa OIL at PACKING Tape sa bag ni Bunny ? 
5775 2018-05-07 13:29:39 I'm pretty sure mine is garlic and olive oil.
5776 2018-05-07 13:29:38 Trump is backed into a corner on #Iran. His support of #Israel and family connection lend him to backing Bibi who says the nuclear deal must be nixed. Rouhani also has a binary approach. Oil is telling you, correctly I believe, that war is inevitable.
5777 2018-05-07 13:29:37 lol gentrification was me going to downtown Asheville for a concert at the Orange Peel and walking by a store that specialized in, I think, some ridiculous shit like olive oil and wine???

5780 2018-05-07 13:29:16 If they pull their bids (which I would do having seen my oil bill rise $250m/day since 1 July 2017) I think we'll see a super-backwardation develop combined with oversupply (ie opposite of 2009 Supercontango amid undersupply) & a world of pain & even a Death Spiral for traders

5790 2018-05-07 13:28:21 Yes, because even if an oil sheikh took over a large unfashionable Spanish or German side they would only need to outspend and overcome 1 or 2 big clubs. In England there's usually at least 3 or 4 clubs im contention. Even Serie A is dominated by Juve these days.

5793 2018-05-07 13:27:53 ...if I'm reading the law right, hemp products have been defined as separate from marijuana in Kansas.

5821 2018-05-07 13:25:24 Remember when oil was over $100 a barrel and gas went up to $1 a litre and everyone freaked? And now oil has “gone up” to $70 a barrel and gas is $1.34 litre.... what a fucking scam.
5822 2018-05-07 13:25:20 Sounds like you talking about Fox News the Trump/Russian Propaganda network. Trump is a cheater Stormy is not the only 1 he paid there are more the pussy grabber -n-chief have been with. #DonTheCon the snake oil salesman.
5823 2018-05-07 13:25:18 nowdays iran is more oil supplier  then soudi arabia
5824 2018-05-07 13:25:15 More and more, the generalist, talking head market commentators, are resorting to "who knows" in talking about where oil is going.  It shows how committed they were to the bear thesis, and spent zero effort in exploring the real dynamics of the mkt. The mantra will change, again.

5833 2018-05-07 13:24:32 I remember after the Prophecy, the Prophet took a bottle of anointing oil, pour half of it on my head, and then anoint both my hands...The Holy Ghost reminded me, the “anointing” is on you to build it just like God said...#anointing #build #just like God said
5834 2018-05-07 13:24:16 Last time it was the 10 yr note above 3%, this time it will be oil above 70$. For whatever reason, the market will find one to regress toward the middle line at 2630. NDX reflects only FAANG, not the entire market situation. It led nowhere last time, so will this time.

5837 2018-05-07 13:23:57 You’re threatening to abandon Iran deal which caused oil prices to go up. Higher gas prices eat up paltry $1.50 a week tax cut that @SpeakerRyan was so excited about.

5844 2018-05-07 13:23:11 Oil’s advance to the highest since 2014 is squeezing the rupee to a point where they're one of the worst in Asia. Further declines in the currency may spur the central bank to raise interest rates faster than what most analysts are forecasting #lka

5855 2018-05-07 13:21:08 In the last cowboy romance I read, the cowboys had found oil on their ranch and become billionaires. It was . . . mediocre.

5887 2018-05-07 13:17:43 Keep this reporting going.  We need more Pro-Trump coverage.  His goals are to increase Russian wealth and influence, and he should be commended for acheiving his goals. $70/Barrel oil helps Putin immensely.

5889 2018-05-07 13:17:42 Another way to look at this: rising oil prices could be also seen as the main force behind the dollar strength due to higher inflation expectations. Would be interesting to see a chart on that too. Dxy vs Oil.

Alberta's fossil fuels drive our economic growth despite the soon to be repealed & banned Carbon Tax. Tell @MarloRaynolds it's my personal gift to him for being arrogant when I met him in 2015 campaign.

5916 2018-05-07 13:14:56 In a weird way imho higher oil price will seem to keep getting correlated to yankee dollar for a while until the rate hike gets completely priced in due to the rise of inflation brought by higher oil prices. We might see $80 on CL before a turn around

5930 2018-05-07 13:12:27 Mr. President, why are oil prices so high? After all, the world market of black gold is abundant. The world is gradually moving to alternative energy sources. Is this all due to instability in the Middle East?

5937 2018-05-07 13:11:34 Oil consumption has continued to increase year over year for the past 50 years. At this time 85% of our energy needs are met with fossil fuel. It's time we look at developing our natural energy
5938 2018-05-07 13:11:24 @TheSporkful Years ago in fast food places I started asking them to put the fries directly into the bag, so it would soak up the extra oil, and they'd frequently ask if I wanted the coldish onion rings and such, and would get a half a bagful for the price of a large.

5961 2018-05-07 13:08:08 Crude prices rose above $70 a barrel overnight for the first time since November 2014 on growing concerns over the collapse of Venezuela's oil industry and possible new sanctions against Iran. President Trump this week will decide whether to pull out of the 2015 nuclear agreement
5962 2018-05-07 13:08:05 If the greedy bastards would stop exporting as much of our oil, for even higher profit, none of these price hikes in gasoline et al, would be necessary! Greatest oxymoron ever - "Corporate Ethic"

5991 2018-05-07 13:06:05 Its a scare tactic, usually. If we stopped importing oil and only used what we had in reserve, we’d run out. It might bet more expensive as we’re importing it from further away. We have a while til we run out what with hybrid and sustainable fuels.

6061 2018-05-07 12:59:57 Anti private sector and lack of pro growth policies kept the Fed at 0% for 8 years, which exacerbated income inequality. Good things sometimes happen in spite of government, not because of. For example domestic oil and gas production under Obama.
6062 2018-05-07 12:59:55 Oh, this is Bob Katter on a good day. Talking bollocks because we do produce oil here, though not much, but if you want really mad Bob give me a minute to find a bit of video.
6063 2018-05-07 12:59:47 The World is awash in oil so why is it becoming more expensive ? I would answer that with Trumps never ending assault on the Iranian nuclear deal in opposition to every ally asking him to back off.

6084 2018-05-07 12:57:44 OPEC affects the price of oil more than anything, you need read up on markets. 4.50 a gallon would be at $130 a barrel of crude then production would ramp up here and send it back down, that’s kind of how it works in up and down cycles based on supply and demand

6100 2018-05-07 12:56:21 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President:  Oil is $70+.  Gas highest per gallon for many, many months.  EPA and other regs. gutted.

6103 2018-05-07 12:56:05 I don't think the deal should remain in place. Tell Iran they will renegotiate or we will shut off ALL oil sales. And replace sanctions worse than ever.

6129 2018-05-07 12:52:42 @anasalhajji One aspect of reduced costs has been the oil industry bringing production online in phases rather than one big project (i.e. Exxon Guyana). They just copy the modules for each phase. it has benefits of cost and time but disadvantages like not maximising production
6130 2018-05-07 12:52:41 It's all paper money. That's why he won't release his tax returns. No US bank will lend him money. But Russian organized crime has. Middle East oil shrieks have. The ones that also finance Muslim terrorists.

6133 2018-05-07 12:52:38 It wasn’t the oil that was the issue. It was the scenario in question being dangerous to the birds that was in question. This was stated and restated many times.

6165 2018-05-07 12:48:37 Why are oil prices surging now? Even if we drop the Iran Deal and sanctions impact Iran heavily, they only produce about 13 percent of daily world production. Where is our supposed allie Saudia Arabia? Where is increased US production?
6166 2018-05-07 12:48:37 Really, This is Trump's fault? Google Obama and crude oil.

6218 2018-05-07 12:42:18 With oil now reaching $70 per barrel, it will only strengthen oil company profits to move forward with this nonsensical fossil fuel plan.  By the way, I’m installing an 8 track deck  in my car.  I’m making a bet on a big comeback!

When  in 2015 oil prices went even as low as between 28 and 35 dollars a barrel and oil production fell to less than one million barrels a day we had no buffer, no savings, to tide us through.

6344 2018-05-07 12:25:31 Nothing will make Iran happier than over $ 100 a barrel oil prices.  Like Japan It already has the knowledge of a bomb, it does not need an actual bomb.
6345 2018-05-07 12:25:31 Yes. Iraq was an unholy mess (half of GFC served in Iraq in different capacities). But none of it - Blair, WMD, oil, stupidity, failing to finish the job - justifies Russia's aggression (it's only just begun) against Europe.
6346 2018-05-07 12:25:19 Girl, Bio Oil!! I started getting stretchmarks on my boobs bc pregnancy, I used bio oil for like 3 days and they are gone. It smells like dried flowers and it works so well. They sell it at CVS and Walmart!
6347 2018-05-07 12:25:19 No country in the P5+1 negotiations was serious about keeping Iran from the bomb - saving the Iran Deal is about saving reputations tied to ploughshares, NIAC, & O Admin.  For Russia, China, & Europe it’s about weapons contracts, oil, & a tanking 400b economy.

That needs to stop.

Europe needs Mideast oil & gas so the entire game there has been preventing Russia & now China from controlling Europe’s energy supply. #BadReligion is a weapon not a cause.

6428 2018-05-07 12:12:53 The interesting thing is that oil prices have been rising pretty significantly despite the strengthening dollar. This shows just how great the concern is that geopolitical risk will cut off supplies from Iran (not to mention Venezuela's situation...)

Cash is weak, demand is tepid, OPEC certainly has ample capacity to substitute for Venezuelan oil, as do other non-OPEC countries

1. inflation was low only AFTER global oil prices crashed. There were no policy side adjustments made to create a low inflation regime. It was all incidental.

2. NFA incurred massive losses and had to receive billions in subsidies to maintain excessive stocks

Why are oil prices rising. I thought with more production gas would go up a little slower.
6457 2018-05-07 12:09:09 I did highlight that her link wasn't an oil report.

6468 2018-05-07 12:08:19 It is different in ND. We don’t fine companies for spills. We have three politicians that monitor the transgressions of the oil companies. We don’t provide protections for workers because we allow the oil companies to use third party contractors who can waive all liability.

6472 2018-05-07 12:08:00 Are #Oil #markets pricing in an end to the #IranDeal by #Trump? The very significant geopolitical risk that such a move would entail has the potential to push oil far higher.
6473 2018-05-07 12:08:00 Thank you president trump.  Every time I put gas in my car and heating oil in my home I marvel at how much you are costing us.  Small tax cut and huge price increases.

6482 2018-05-07 12:06:30 Is the goal to applaud Trump or to agree with conservative principles? This speaks to my entire argument. I will search for one because it seems like a worthwhile endeavor for my own sake. But you should reconsider why you like Trump if indeed you do.
6483 2018-05-07 12:06:17 Venezuela appropriated their oil industry and tried to run it like a socialist commune. That's socialism. Scandinavia is mostly just squandering the wealth of 100 years of capitalist success. Slight exception in Norway, which might be the only well run government in the world.
6484 2018-05-07 12:06:03 Yes, she sent me that link and I responded with The Scotsman article on negative oil revenues.

Indy whatever the cost either in monetary or social cohesion for some I'm afraid.
6485 2018-05-07 12:05:40 手を出すなら覚悟した方が
6486 2018-05-07 12:05:39 Clearly you don't understand that the only revenue from oil comes in the form of tax on oil companies. This is close to zero. Swinney begged Osborne to slash taxes on oil companies to help employment in the north east. Oil does not bring in cash now. It's over.

6506 2018-05-07 12:03:31 #QandA No tax reform can offset the negative impact of rising oil prices, only fuel efficiencies increasing in sync with oil prices can do that. But governments are still building oil dependent infrastructure which increases oil use

6516 2018-05-07 12:02:12 As global oil demand increases, global warming makes peace and progress less possible. Supporting any oil is social suicide. The atmosphere doesn't care if the CO2 comes from 'good guys' or 'bad guys.' Anyone who thinks it does is a fool or worse.

6593 2018-05-07 11:53:46 I don't see why not. We still used the oil, but cola instead of eggs & water so it shouldn't affect the flavour much. Can't taste the cola 
6594 2018-05-07 11:53:35 Expected Thierry to be there. But he opted to celebrate with oil farmers up in Manchester.

6597 2018-05-07 11:53:19 Glad the gun was unloaded and it was just your thumb. Too many stories end in tragedy. 
I always hated the smell of the gun oil when my father cleaned his guns. He let me fire at a target once. I hated the feeling, the smell. Never touched one again.
6598 2018-05-07 11:53:16 I'm placing an essential oil order this week. Anyone need anything? I'll share my discount! 

(Depending on what you need - we can ship it if you're not local!) 

Here are a few of my favorites for essential oil newbies
6599 2018-05-07 11:52:47 I can still tell that my hair performs better without a relaxer - I had my hair in a bun for two weeks and it instantly lathered when I washed my hair. Using heavy mineral oil products on relaxed hair would take 3 washes to get lather.
6600 2018-05-07 11:52:41 Baby oil on deck because friction burn is not my portion today amen.
6601 2018-05-07 11:52:40 Sesame oil just makes everything left over better the next day. Hahahhahaha.
6602 2018-05-07 11:52:35 God is not going to continue to pour oil into a broken vessel #MondayMotivation
6603 2018-05-07 11:52:02 Volatile oil prices will be "more than adequate" even if the oil price plummets again and we face minimal or even negative tax revenues???

I'll leave you to your delusions. Enjoy the rest of your holiday tho.
6604 2018-05-07 11:51:59 People! I didn't think I needed to say this but I guess y'all proved me wrong again. Please do not watch porn while I'm trying to ask you what oil you want in your car! It's just not bud not ok
6605 2018-05-07 11:51:49 That is so true. Tulsa tried to get in on the new distribution center and I am so glad that the initiative failed. We just diversified from oil. The last thing this town needs is to sink everything into Amazon.

6609 2018-05-07 11:51:16 We are being raped without protection from Washington. On top of that ,the oil companies were given 4 billion a year in subsidies.
6610 2018-05-07 11:51:13 45 is barely middle aged these days. Just be kind to yourself and listen to your body. Evening primrose oil? Brewers yeast? Slices of ginger in your morning tea? (all those worked and still do for me..)
6611 2018-05-07 11:51:03 The Clean water act is ignored by Oil and Gas companies and most of PA under ground wells are polluted and awaiting a huge gas bomb,,
6612 2018-05-07 11:50:56 Who cares???   What are you doing about $70 a barrel for oil??  So much for the extra $$$ from the tax cut!!!

6618 2018-05-07 11:50:14 They just not fit for what they are intending them to do.. I think that PoW should be used to store hash of non-PoW public ledgers on daily basis, so no one can rewrite history, but also don't need to burn tanker of oil to transfer 5 bucks..
6619 2018-05-07 11:50:12 going to be powerful day for US equities, because of:
1) higher dax/Europe because of bad macro data
2)higher dax/Europe because of higher dollar

3) so higher US equities because of the 2 above

4) higher US equities because of higher oil price

So it's all positive

6643 2018-05-07 11:46:15 Ti spiego come funziona il giochetto. Con lo shale oil riesci ad essere competitivo anche a 20-25 dollari al barile e tagli letteralmente fuori le tecniche convenzionali di estrazione (soprattutto le off shore). Quindi giocando sul prezzo metti o meno in difficoltà qualcuno.

Seriously. How is the penny not dropping? This is not difficult.

7210 2018-05-07 10:24:36 Btw April 2013 & June 2014, average crude oil sale is above $100 at 2.1m barrel per day

Quickly, do the Arithmetics:
2.1m X 100 =$210m/day
210m X 30 =$6300m ($6.3b)/ month
April, 2013 to June, 2014 is 15 months.
Therefore, $6.3 X 15 = $94.5b
@ 1$ to N190

 $94.5 X 190 =~N18T
7211 2018-05-07 10:24:19 Trust me when the govt fails to pay debt they'll be compensated in more ways than one. We are now mining oil, our countrys location is perfect port wise. Look at what China did to Sir Lanka. Money is never a motivation to some countries/people. Power and access is.

7560 2018-05-07 09:18:45 Oil is dependable and transportable to begin with. Gally is correct on all fronts here. If we embrace electric cars we need to move away from coal to something cleaner and more reliable. Given that 4th generation nuclear costs half of coal power, that is where we should look.

Now, Under Modi: Crude Oil/Barrel was $70.

7574 2018-05-07 09:15:50 Very interesting.. and worrying..  You mention oil and gas but what about renewables?  Surely the fact we have to import most of the technology & that e.g. most windfarms are foreign owned has a big impact on GNI?

7813 2018-05-07 08:30:16 Your theory of being the 5yr ave is wrong as shown from the data. Even with increased light part of the middle distillate barrel (kerosene) the yield in the first 17 weeks of the year shows middle distillate yield having fallen. You need to understand the chemistry of crude oil
7814 2018-05-07 08:30:13 Having said that, traders and investors should be ready for #oil prices to go to new levels within the next 1-2 weeks. If Iran situation is not resolved, we will go above $80/barr. If it is - well below $70.

When a refinery goes down in the states OUR gas is through the roof. Why aren't we absolutely independent from the idiosyncrasies of global oil as we are being handcuffed.

8031 2018-05-07 07:48:37 Iran with nuks and ICBM's is a lot more important to most people than the price of oil. There are priorities in this world.

8038 2018-05-07 07:46:44 @SteveAustinABC @abcbrisbane Australia is significantly below the mandated requirement for oil supplies yet we're paying well above terminal gate price for fuel. The premium we're expected to pay is not contributing to storage that's for sure.

8045 2018-05-07 07:44:55 shit by all the ruling govts. There were no infrastructure,no services, nothing. While the oil from Assam was taken out but the state didn't get it's due royalty.

8051 2018-05-07 07:44:07 I can't wait to watch humanity take up all of the oil and watch them run around like it is the end of the world.

Meanwhile, Indigenous peoples have been without oil in their sustainable cultures since the dawn of humanity.

Then we have to save the colonizers ass' again.

8116 2018-05-07 07:28:55 I blame first the person in charge of that event. That singular photo puts a drop of oil on his sacred white garment.

Besides, that banner looks like a banner for a meeting to discuss the menace of herdsmen attacks and the sorrow it brings.
8117 2018-05-07 07:28:47 Well they "protected the oil". From the beginning. Can you see that is how to "protect the civilians"?

Saddam killed max 3000 armed kurd rebels. USA/uk killed millions. See the maths? 

Oil never stopped flowing. Ie protecting civilians=continuous oil flow.

See? No me neither!

8554 2018-05-07 05:51:40 If you take the recent oil fluctuations into account you are right. Also the Scottish economy is growing at a slower rate comp to rUK
8555 2018-05-07 05:51:29 Plenty of people in Taranaki support ending fossil extraction. Stop listening to multinational oil companies and start listening to the region's young people who are the ones most affected
8556 2018-05-07 05:51:16 Three things I realized after getting my set of paintbrushes:
1. That I would need an easel
2. That I would should've bought oil or acrylic paints first since I already have a fewer set of fine brushes

2.a. And if indeed I bought oil paint tubes, I should've bought linseed oil
8557 2018-05-07 05:51:02 What should be noticed is why Russia is using a floating nuclear power plant to power oil rigs in the arctic! Since when are platforms not self-contained.

8560 2018-05-07 05:50:51 Next they should check their wines. Art, olive oil, and wine are some of the most counterfeited  items in the world because few people know the difference and folks that don't are too embarrassed to admit they don't know what they are talking about.
8561 2018-05-07 05:50:49 Coal and oil are very much 21st century fuels, because they provide massive baseload power and are relatively cheap
Just ask India or China or many other countries about to construct around 600 coal-fired power stations

8569 2018-05-07 05:49:14 Oil demand grew 1.6M bpd last year globally. 1.2M the year before. That more than makes up for the amount OPEC cut—and would therefore be putting back onto market.

8575 2018-05-07 05:47:50 I read many opinions on how Iran’s crude oil exports are likely to decline following snap-back US sanctions, but no one seems to provide a well explained view on the mechanics of that. It was UN sanctions that limited exports not US. Rest of P5+1 don't seem on-board.

8580 2018-05-07 05:46:23 When oil was at $120 and the Canadian dollar was worth 1.05 USD, manufacturing was getting killed in Ontario and Quebec. I remember Albertans not expressing much sympathy for hard working folks who lost their manufacturing jobs then.

8583 2018-05-07 05:45:42 And since we have no refineries any longer, ignore any calls for more oil drilling. And definitely not start or join any wars, shooting or trade or otherwise. And maybe try to use less?

8590 2018-05-07 05:44:24 (1) your assertion is just plain dumb. If you don't understand that oil sands are a declining, finite resource and that it is not just prudent but vitally necessary for us to prepare now for a future without it, then no one can smarten you up. #abpoli #cdnpoli

8628 2018-05-07 05:38:33 Right, when crude oil was more than 100 dollar per barrel petrol  and diesel rate was less than the present price. Taxing the common man !
8629 2018-05-07 05:38:22 In parts of Long Island I’ve seen $3.99 a gallon which equals $4.00 in my book. Heating oil is close to $3.00 a gallon. Wow!! Americans are winning right off the chain. Not!!

8648 2018-05-07 05:34:12 Mayonnaise Fast: 1. As previously stated, the dinosaurs went extinct due to a severe lack of mayonnaise, which could not exist yet, as their bodies had not become oil. Chickens lay eggs, which assist in the creation of mayonnaise; chickens are descendants of dinosaurs.
8649 2018-05-07 05:33:58 Irrelevant to the people who want Canada to buy foreign oil and to shut down all fuel production in Canada. We are not dealing with rational people and to give them the time of day is a complete waste of time.

8653 2018-05-07 05:33:17 Is that still true? I thought the higher GDP per cap was only at very high oil tax revenues and eroded recently?

8692 2018-05-07 05:23:44 You bet that is what is happening! The US is selling record levels of light sweet crude, that they produce, around the world for world market price and also selling record amounts of refined petroleum products, made from discounted canadian oil, at world market price.

8711 2018-05-07 05:20:14 BC is protesting pipelines not oil .

8752 2018-05-07 05:12:14 give them a good soak in epsom salts and colloidal oatmeal. Then massage castor oil into them. It will heal them and relieve pain. I hope no blisters? If you have those, the special blister bandages do help.
8753 2018-05-07 05:12:11 Do some research. Ignorance is so common... a bird feathers brushes up against poles. Often a few birds try to get to the pole at once and get bumped around and run up against the oil along the pole. Hope this helps with your small logic of birds landing vertically on a pole.

8842 2018-05-07 04:56:57 fun fact: those lotions u love from victoria’s secret & places like it, are artificially scented & have lots of chemicals in them. it’s much more beneficial to moisturize with natural oils/butters (coconut oil, grapeseed oil, shea butter, cocoa butter, etc)  love ur skin

8851 2018-05-07 04:54:49 Oil of Ulay became Oil of Olay in the late 90’s. It was all about globalization of the brand and cost saving on print/marketing etc. same as Marathon becoming Snickers, Opal Fruits becoming Starburst etc

8898 2018-05-07 04:44:43 Sorry, should read: where oil is being drilled.
Sorry, I didnt mean to offend anybody 
8899 2018-05-07 04:44:43 WHAT NOT TO DO! 
~ use strong cleansers
~ showering with hot water
~  rub to dry your face 
~ peel your skin! 
~ use coconut oil as a moisturizer 
~ over exfoliate
8900 2018-05-07 04:44:20 If my stoned ass doesn’t stop putting my oil pen in weird ass places I’m gonna beat my own ass
8901 2018-05-07 04:44:13 I usually just let it heal with my natural scalp oil, I can’t wash my hair too much after a whole ass bleaching. Right now it’s blue, and yours?
8902 2018-05-07 04:44:12 Oil companies are in favour? Lol.. that is what Notley and Trudeau were pushing while introducing a carbon tax. Where are those oil companies?

8908 2018-05-07 04:43:22 you should try olive oil mayo
8909 2018-05-07 04:43:17 Lol nah but I seen ha at the oil spill and wanted to drop kick ha ass
8910 2018-05-07 04:43:15 I keep seeing my essential oil diffuser... diffusing... out of the corner of my eye and thinking it's a ghost. Even though I've looked 10+ times just to see it's the diffuser, but I can't stop checking. What if it's a ghost friend here to keep me company?
8911 2018-05-07 04:42:51 Yeah - farm safety - who wants to give farm workers the same rights as every other industry in the province? How dare the government think that was a good idea? 
And CT - oil companies support it. Huh.
8912 2018-05-07 04:42:51 But Tommy said we don't need oil or petrol, so why would this crisis even affect him?
8913 2018-05-07 04:42:46 God can understand or speak only one language....ha...ha...how much oil you'll pour India...sir...?
8914 2018-05-07 04:42:45 of course the real issue is.... If we are an oil exporting nation, who doesn't import from Iran, and is using less oil. Why are gas prices going up?
8915 2018-05-07 04:42:43 improvise　vt, vi. （詩・音楽など）即興で作る・演奏する

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
8916 2018-05-07 04:42:43 so yun naihalo ko lang naman sa patis na ginamit ko yung chili oil na may amag so good luck to me and my insides i guess
8917 2018-05-07 04:42:37 Fresh sheets, shaved legs, face mask, lit candles, and my hair drenched in coconut oil while drinking a beer and watching Netflix.....WHAT A GREAT WAY TO END MY SUNDAY 
8918 2018-05-07 04:42:35 Ikr!! I’ve been looking for a good scalp oil to save me! What’s your hair color?

8921 2018-05-07 04:42:07 Oh dang... Nice
8922 2018-05-07 04:41:56 SJ ran home and got some conditioner, coconut oil +a comb. She spent 30 minutes trying to untangle it. Unfortunately it was so tangled, she made a little headway but didn't get it all out of the brush. We walked her home so she could wait for her niece.
8923 2018-05-07 04:41:55 Right smack in the middle of the oil patch. Midland, TX. We are the highest in the State at 2.89.
8924 2018-05-07 04:41:50 Skincare routine: unscented soap/water, dry oil or Vaseline and a nice night cream that’s all you fucking need y’all.
8925 2018-05-07 04:41:22 Snake oil salesman.
8926 2018-05-07 04:41:19 We do have industry you know, like renewable energy, whisky, tourism, etc. You'd honestly think oil & gas was all we had.
8927 2018-05-07 04:41:15 Being a conservative is now associated with supporting all sorts of compromised creatures with low character and shady histories. It’s sad that the GOP has turned into the party of snake oil salesmen.
8928 2018-05-07 04:41:11 Can u make the oil to gel in tube , it will be easy to carry
8929 2018-05-07 04:40:45 At 11.13 he went to the kitchen and brought back all the cooking oil to bed with him and that was when I realised I needed to get the fk out
8930 2018-05-07 04:40:29 おにーさんにまかせとけー！
8931 2018-05-07 04:40:14 え、君顎あるの？顎ってやっぱりどこかで買うの？僕顎持ってないんだけど。

8934 2018-05-07 04:39:31 We have the same issue on bin 1, bin 2 works fine. I'm wondering if bin 1 hyd spool is letting to much oil past.
8935 2018-05-07 04:39:29 I HAVE been using straight sweet almond oil and jojoba oils mixed into a leave in
8936 2018-05-07 04:39:05 Exactly. I am facing a lot of wastage of acrylic paints as they dry up soon in this hot dry weather in Noida summers. Also, with the kind of detailing  of water, one has to be quite quick before the paint dries up. I am planning to switch to oil, and gouache for miniatures.
8937 2018-05-07 04:38:52 My mom would’ve came in with the holy oil
8938 2018-05-07 04:38:50 Yup, Tj nailed it.  I lost my job, my wife lost her job.  All within days of each other.  The mere insinuation that somehow me or my family deserved this because I work in oil and gas makes me angry.  We rebounded, all good now, but there are lots of angry Albertans
8939 2018-05-07 04:38:46 @Oprah Ms. Winfrey,your tweet about how Jordan Peele used story as a weapon for change. As the only black woman in my division working for 1 of the "Big Oil" corps, I wrote about my experiences getting here and why diversity is a myth for white, male dominated corp America.

8948 2018-05-07 04:35:21 I bet Iran has oil.
8949 2018-05-07 04:35:05 Josh is pliable. He bends to the needs of the FF industry. Looks r deceptive. Looks a nice guy - talks in hushed tone - just another snake oil salesman.
8950 2018-05-07 04:34:52 Just remember, radioactive oil still lubricates.   Actually not something to worry about.  The oil is way to deep.
8951 2018-05-07 04:34:47 Nope sir! This isn't oil painting! Its just a computer editing..!
8952 2018-05-07 04:34:25 This oil commodity market is insane. Different countries and different oil companies should be able to sell oil at whatever price they want. Then we'd have true supply and demand and competition. Iran wants to sell oil for less than the current market price. I think that's great.
8953 2018-05-07 04:34:19 I just exfoliated, cleansed, and put my Jamaican castor oil on my lashes, edges & brows. Now I’m hitting my bong with my bonnet on. Living my best life

8959 2018-05-07 04:33:06 Yes, slam Taranaki with Oil and Gas ban, announce it at Vic Uni, then have your man Parker signal more potential fiscal/social ruin for the region.

8963 2018-05-07 04:32:10 Bio oil cures the soul
8964 2018-05-07 04:31:46 Y'know. I always liked the idea of a full body (and I mean "full body") massage as foreplay but if condoms are involved, oil can't really be in the mix
8965 2018-05-07 04:31:44 The 68 is Alberta. Total for west is 86; vs 82 in 2017 vs. 36 in 2016; vs 132 when WTI oil was $97 a bbl in 2013 (price one-third lower now and 1/3 fewer rigs). Always low point for  Canadian drilling due to breakup. Rigs are down until ground firms and road restrictions off.

He even questioned why do we have them if we can't use them. Should we trust a kid with the Iran deal, N. Korea, Russian an China relations?
8999 2018-05-07 04:24:57 Essence dulu krn serumnya itu oil.

9002 2018-05-07 04:24:20 Can government for #election benefit unofficially tweak daily petroleum pricing policy? Who is responsible for such #election gimmick related losses of oil mktg. companies. #karnataka. #SC should intervene to stop such political losses. #INDIA. Politics already bankrupted banks.

9006 2018-05-07 04:23:21 @NancyCNBC @_HadleyGamble that is why USD & oil go up at the same time since these are related to two different events! usually these two are moving against each other! i think very soon we will see which one stops either USD or Oil up trend!

9011 2018-05-07 04:22:41 A snake oil salesman has been legitimized. But it could be worse, he could have been nominated to Secretary of Health.
9012 2018-05-07 04:22:30 Yup, although the price still doesn’t make sense. Gas companies are crooked... we need it so they can charge what they want, even if oil is cheaper/barrel. We always have a giggle when we’re in the US.  Gas seems like a bargain.
9013 2018-05-07 04:22:02 Don't know about that buddy. This province is leading as we speak. Top it off, there are more jobs to be had other than oil field now

9016 2018-05-07 04:21:55 While I'm all for cutting oil and gas subsidies as well, we can't cut trillions from their subsidies for the simple reason that that is a made up number and we don't spend anywhere close to that on oil and gas subsidies.

9021 2018-05-07 04:21:05 $NOG ER Monday morning. Oil over $70 last time was in 2015 Super Bullish.  think we could run from positive guidance to over $2.50 near term
9022 2018-05-07 04:20:41 Putin has a major interest in keeping Iranian oil off the market. He needs $100+ oil to float his budget.
9023 2018-05-07 04:20:37 I don't know what is harder about oil pulling, not talking for a whole 20 minutes or not gagging
9024 2018-05-07 04:20:33 I would have better luck trying to tell him the Persian Gulf wasn’t about oil. He’s seen Norman and his dog is the one that’s reactive.

9028 2018-05-07 04:20:14 Getting essential oil in your eye is worse than soap. @ me
9029 2018-05-07 04:20:07 Because of trump working for his oil friends wake up people trump is all about the 1% and putin
9030 2018-05-07 04:19:37 Okay my dumbass used tanning oil twice. Stepped out for 10 mins in the sun and felt burnt af, THEN decided to use sunscreen. 
9031 2018-05-07 04:19:26 Fun fact: the term snake oil salesman seems to come from the fact that people (like Clark Stanley in the early 1900's) sold "snake oil" that contained little to no snake oil (typically containing things mineral oil and low omega-3 fats)
9032 2018-05-07 04:19:21 ほんとそれでしたわ。あと眼鏡外したんで高いのはわかるけどよく見えない状態で怖かったですー
9033 2018-05-07 04:19:09 No OIL, No LIFE!!!
9034 2018-05-07 04:19:00 Possibly! I try to avoid any dairy, refined sugar, and grains! Stick to good fats (like coconut oil and avocado), proteins, veggies and limit fruits! Give the body what it wants and the body will give you what you want! 
9035 2018-05-07 04:18:20 Perhaps there is method to Trump's madness re Iran...piss them off, they raise oil prices... Vladimir Putin give's Donald a big wink... and more money to Trump enterprises via back door channels from Vladimir...yep Trump is onto a Winner for him..
9036 2018-05-07 04:18:08 I’m already putting blessed oil on my hands and I’m not even going to work until tomorrow  imma bless my classroom and I’m touching kids too! Jesus dwell within that place and within those children! Renew their minds  
9037 2018-05-07 04:17:54 All Trump needs to get out free: dementia.  + of course the stupidity of American voters.  DYK Pruitt was in Morocco to buy them a coke float to cut diplomatic ties with Iran? SA using US of Oil to block Iran while SA + Putin send Yamal LNG via melting Arctic Polar Road to China.
9038 2018-05-07 04:17:49 Yeah I use to use oils in Hawaii not gonna lie but I feel my skin has taken in a lot of sun damage so I’m trying to be more cautious lol but maybe you can try a low sunblock (for protection) and then some oil for color
9039 2018-05-07 04:17:37 @realDonaldTrump Dear President Trump, I am fully aware that the price of oil is traded in an open market and is a commodity.  However, the world is awash in oil and yet the price has been trending upward.  It seems obvious that prices are being manipulated.  MAGA!

I'm grateful for help so I have a $70 mailing address last month. Jobs here are few if any great or good ones. I don't fit in on the regular retail crowd jobs. Really need help to pick up life #ti
9050 2018-05-07 04:14:29 Anyone have any shop recommendations on the west side where I can get my hands on some CBD oil or salve?
9051 2018-05-07 04:14:21 Oh yeah fuck that damn oil
9052 2018-05-07 04:14:15 The biggest burning question after #WWEBacklash is: Did @TrueKofi, @WWEBigE, & @XavierWoodsPhD leave any baby oil on the shelves for the other shoppers this afternoon? #WWEBacklash #NewDay #NewDayShines #NewDayGlistens
9053 2018-05-07 04:14:04 Why is the price of gas the same it was when oil was selling for 150$ a baril. It’s selling for 70$. Stop lying Canadians deserve better than your propaganda.
9054 2018-05-07 04:13:57 exactly!! Plus all that oil is hard to get out of sheets
9055 2018-05-07 04:13:40 I was so hungry and my red potatoes were taking too long to cook so I added more oil and turned up the heat. left for a minute and now I’m here eating burnt ass potatoes 

patience is a virtue
9056 2018-05-07 04:13:34 Ill fight the ñoldor. I’m not afraid of them. They need to face the truth: their magical tree sap rocks are snake oil
9057 2018-05-07 04:13:13 Well I don’t mind breaking into a sweat but let it be from work and not oil 
9058 2018-05-07 04:13:07 Can't wait to reach that point in my life where I have the nightly routine of shave, exfoliate and coconut oil  because skin goals = comfortable living
9059 2018-05-07 04:12:45 Both California and Texas have lots of oil. One is booming. One is dying. What's the difference?
9060 2018-05-07 04:12:44 Tapos pag oily yung hinuhugasan, kamay muna ang pangkuskos bago sponge to remove excess oil (I think alam mo na to)
9061 2018-05-07 04:12:37 That’s understandable. I heard if you put conditioner in the bleach and dye it make your hair less brittle but after I dyed my hair I did constant oil treatments and ACV rinses.
9062 2018-05-07 04:12:34 My bf being a mechanic is awesome! He’s always doing my oil changes, fixing my lights, etc. 
9063 2018-05-07 04:12:19 "that's oil, you're milk, you don't play tryna mix" AWWW malaika!!!! every time we watched this i had to explain this to my sister and she never fucking understood it  #SaveTheLastDance
9064 2018-05-07 04:12:19 This figure accounts for more emissions than both the entire country of France and the world’s largest oil companies, including Exxon (which produced 577 million tons), Shell (508 million), and BP (448 million).
9065 2018-05-07 04:11:48 people rave about coconut oil but it literally made my hair fall out in handfuls (okay that’s probably dramatic but it shed A LOT) like wtf
9066 2018-05-07 04:11:43 Some people are sooo against putting coconut oil on your face but it works great for me so 
9067 2018-05-07 04:11:34 Sksksksksks people get SO DEFENSIVE when you tell them that things like lemon, coconut oil, baking soda, sugar etc are actually bad for their skin
9068 2018-05-07 04:11:25 You, a nerd: It's wild that Crisco sells coconut oil.
9069 2018-05-07 04:11:23 But for color treated hair, i’d definitely go with the Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil line. It works wonders!
9070 2018-05-07 04:11:21 Of course. Read my columns about how AB oil sands needs to expand to push out high carbon-intensity heavy crude. But look beyond today. Change is coming. If your only issue is selling more oil at less cost, you're completely missing the big picture.
9071 2018-05-07 04:11:20 There's always a limit

9092 2018-05-07 04:07:50 Saya tak pakai tea tree set, saya pakai vitamin E. Tapi pernah pakai tea tree punya oil tu. Asal jerawat naik, letak overnight, pagi tak bengkak da. Depends condition kulit. Kalau tak teruk sangat. Boleh pakai range lain.
9093 2018-05-07 04:07:24 How long did it take it to rub off the oil and get to the seeds again?
9094 2018-05-07 04:07:16 Don’t remember what my hyd oil temp was last year. But I noticed it was at 180 now. Which seems high to me. That’s what made me second guess hyd settings.

9098 2018-05-07 04:06:02 Globalization just burns up resources at a faster rate -its massively inefficient. We have burned 1/2 the oil that has ever been burnt in something like the last 10 years cause the supply chains are so long. Local production employs more people conserves resources, pollutes less.

9103 2018-05-07 04:05:07 The midget subs did more damage.  They actually shelled two different spots on the West Coast.  One was at an oil field near Santa Barbara just north of LA and the second was at Fort Stevens at the mouth of the Columbia river in Oregon. The Japanese were able to launch a seaplane

9121 2018-05-07 04:02:19 Tip that actually works but I’ve only tried it today:
USE COCONUT OIL AS A HAIR MASK PRIOR TO SHOWER. Massage through scalp (especially if scalp is dry) and work through ends. Leave on for at least 10 minutes. Rinse with moisturizing shampoo & cond! My hair & scalp feels SO good!
9122 2018-05-07 04:02:12 I was checking the oil in my car at a gas station earlier today and the lady at the pump next to me asked me if I knew what I was doing, then proceeded to tell me I “just looked so cute”  #imalmost19 #not12

9165 2018-05-07 03:56:06 nope. not leaking anything that i can see. just got my coolant line replaced a few months ago. oil levels are good cuz i got an oil change like 600 miles ago... heard a few different ideas. someone said head gasket... not sure if my car would still run if that were the issue tho
9166 2018-05-07 03:56:02 Eso es Totalmente cierto amigo.   El oil realmente se ha ido haciendo cada vez mas barato porque su precio  no incorpora la inflación y el por r adquisitivo del mundo se eleva.  

En todo caso,  lo logramos y que bueno ver estos comentarios. 

Un ABRAZO y mis respetos a UDS

9170 2018-05-07 03:55:37 Awww noooo! Why dont you let it stew again so it absorbs the oil and chuck in some stock? All is not lost!
9171 2018-05-07 03:55:27 Would that be enough to disrupt any of the oil rigs out there?

Got it.

9183 2018-05-07 03:52:09 Esto lo hicieron en estados unidos pero hace 100 años!!! En nuestro país es increíble que todavía no existan estas regulaciones, basta con imaginarnos como se escucho en su momento demandando el gobierno de EEUu vs la estándar oil.

9186 2018-05-07 03:51:14 But what can be done
For an old heart like mine
Soften it up

9191 2018-05-07 03:50:00 Extremely hype about the new oil/cologne I bought this week.. plus the fact I’m getting a haircut.... Road to someone’s daughter’s guts begins now.
9192 2018-05-07 03:49:53 so this week i’m gonna go to the mall and exchange the broken infuser. buy a new oil for myself
9193 2018-05-07 03:49:43 If you have any special essential oil mixes let me know 
9194 2018-05-07 03:49:20 全ての料理はオイルなしに作れない…(作れるのもあるかも、え、あるのかなぁ)
9195 2018-05-07 03:49:02 No one told me getting a dog would mean being awake for an hour from 4am trying to settle him because he’s got hayfever and he can’t stop scratching his poor tummy  rubbing coconut oil at 4am is not the one
9196 2018-05-07 03:48:33 Burnt my tongue by not thinking of when I took a fry out of hot oil and applied directly to tongue. I heard my taste buds sizzle. But it did not register anything on my pain scale. Now my tongue is numb. Just numb.
9197 2018-05-07 03:48:29 Check the thread for specifics! I have only used coconut oil myself, lol I get stubborn about trying new things when I find something that works for me.
9198 2018-05-07 03:48:23 My chili oil tastes better :)

Patra:What's ONGC!?
Me:Oil n Natural Gas Commission
Patra:Oil to hum Patanjali ka hi use karte hain aur agar aapko 'natural gas' kam karna hai to Patanjali paachan use kijiye aur jahan tak commission ka sawal hai, wo Karnatak sarkar se puchiye 
9202 2018-05-07 03:47:24 Lot of heat, little sesame oil, okay, fine. American cheese is used to make sauces smooth. It isn't your flavor component for anything. I hate this guy
9203 2018-05-07 03:47:18 We already regret offering it. We regret trusting you. We regret you turned out to be such a-holes. This would be the least of our regrets and you'll be importing oil this year.
9204 2018-05-07 03:47:04 where yal come from with this wet looking hair do.... likeeeee.. all of yal look like yal had a good ass hot oil treatment and......
9205 2018-05-07 03:47:02 okay so i’ve had acne for as long as i can remember and I always took off my makeup and washed my face and tried ENDLESS amount of products and NOTHING WORKED. I started using coconut oil to take off my makeup and my skin is clear other than occasional breakouts during a period!
9206 2018-05-07 03:46:55 You said "you have to earn your place on the card" when they were kept off the card because @wwe wanted that oil money enough to cave to discrimination. So yeah, your comments really were that messed up.

9219 2018-05-07 03:45:21 Ideals our politicians follow are petty parody of greed for money & power. Nothing much, nothing less. Evident they are feeding on ignorance of uneducated & poor. Snake oil sellers don't last, but we've got lots. Nepal needs #education to rid of this pests & #soonWewill together

Almost 4-5 bottles of water a day!
Reasons why I love being in my environment. When I’m not all the bs come to play  I gotta get back disciplined on that!
9222 2018-05-07 03:44:58 @DrGundry Your Golden Milk Latte recipe calls for 2 t of coconut oil.  That is 8 gr of sat fat which basically takes up 2/3 of one's daily requirement.  How many does your golden milk latte recipe serve?  If you leave out the coffee, and just  add the  milk, still 2 t of oil?

9228 2018-05-07 03:44:04 It’s fine that you don’t agree with it - whatever - but suggesting he is a snake oil salesman, only doing it for money is ridiculous.

9232 2018-05-07 03:43:40 I swore I read in the pdf or an answer where you recommended a non-gmo product. I knew you weren’t pushing non-gmo. But i remember being perturbed because everything else is spot on. But im wrong I believe. And soy oil is horrible regardless of gm or not.

9245 2018-05-07 03:40:54 I think...the map doesn't include shale oil which, prior to the "fracking revolution" was even more of a bitch to get at than tar sands. Thanks for the article - interesting :)
9246 2018-05-07 03:40:54 Allow oil drilling in the Amazon rain forest? Why not? What could possibly go wrong? @Lenin: how much money will you & your friends be pocketing for this outrageous destruction of indigenous people and one of the world's most vitally important wilderness regions?

9248 2018-05-07 03:40:30 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
9249 2018-05-07 03:40:29 It was a nice, hopeful story. People like hopeful stories. If you didn't dig into the numbers, it made sense on the surface. More EVs = less oil. It's just that people don't really dig into the data.
9250 2018-05-07 03:40:29 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
9251 2018-05-07 03:40:24 Reality check. We export more oil than we import. We have a deal to purchase oil at a cheap price. But those countries cannot sell oil to other countries. They have to allow us to sell our oil to other countries at a higher price.

9267 2018-05-07 03:38:09 Crude and Dollar both appreciating together is negative for countries who import oil. May be too early to talk about negative impact on India's macro but its in that direction.

9278 2018-05-07 03:36:40 Yes, usually higher in fat, mostly monounsaturated fat, from nuts, olive oil, avocado etc.
9279 2018-05-07 03:36:02 Careful of that Pandoras box you wanna play with....

9300 2018-05-07 03:31:49 Just got a triple kill with Mr. Game & Watch’s Oil Panic... don’t call me when I’m making millions
9301 2018-05-07 03:31:49 I’ve worked offshore and played in crude oil for 20 years. I’m not liking my chances.
9302 2018-05-07 03:31:31 Oil and water
9303 2018-05-07 03:31:11 There is no shortage of oil. The reason for the spike in oil prices is because oil brokers & investors are freaking out over Trump’s dealings with Iran. The US is now the biggest producer and exporter of oil in the world but @realDonaldTrump blames it on OPEC.
9304 2018-05-07 03:31:10 Oil prices have been climbing partly because of expectations that President Donald Trump will abandon the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which allowed Iran to export more crude.
9305 2018-05-07 03:31:03 going to try out rosehip seed oil from the ordinary. skin literally needs some improvement 
9306 2018-05-07 03:31:02 Just got home by cab ride from @Walmart after they stripped my oil pan plug and left me with no vehicle and they were just arguing whether it’s their fault or the other Wal-Mart where my oil was changed last

9310 2018-05-07 03:30:35 try to pinpoint things you're sensitive to -- citrus oil and lavender oil are common sensitizers (as in your reactions to them can get worse over time) and they're in SO MUCH STUFF because they make things smell good.
9311 2018-05-07 03:30:15 I love the next paragraph "foreign funded special interests " who could possibly have a greater interest in the pipeline failing than the oil refineries in Texas they'd have to pay market price not pennies on the dollar
9312 2018-05-07 03:30:06 ever deal with people on facebook, etc, who try to get you into alternative therapies??? 
have even had my own sister and niece try it on me when they were into stupid pyramid selling and weight loss etc.
keep it to yourself! have someone trying to talk me into cannabis oil now
9313 2018-05-07 03:29:53 What shampoo do you use? Does coconut oil moisturize these bunches to look like this?
9314 2018-05-07 03:29:22 Yes, I could have singlehandedly gotten millions more ppl in TX to vote for Hillary.  Too many oil execs & oil workers + evangelicals who vote on one issue - abortion - in this state.
9315 2018-05-07 03:29:21 I wish they had done an "Oil Change" type doc.
9316 2018-05-07 03:29:01 True, but they drag the reputation of the whole province down with them. It’s oil and bigotry that gets the most attention.

9319 2018-05-07 03:28:11 New tax law for the people and now the oil companies figure, hey they can afford it, let’s raise the price of gas!  Capitalism is mainly greed, power and corruption, not necessarily in that order!
9320 2018-05-07 03:28:00 And how are you going to explain this to the oil companies who have been vocally in favour of carbon pricing?
9321 2018-05-07 03:27:35 Cooked the beef gochujang for Aidan today, think it came out okay, but will do something more similar to last time in future. Little more oil.

9328 2018-05-07 03:26:07 Dongfang is a strange one. Shares +50% since announcing acquisition of Australian camellia oil processing business 2 weeks ago. Can't figure out why it's so profitable. $DFM
9329 2018-05-07 03:25:40 @TuckerCarlson 
Fabio? So fitting to have guy whose claim to fame is bodice ripping covers on romance novels and someone who can't tell the difference between whipped oil and butter as an interview.  I suspect it's those rippling muscles on those covers that caught Tucker's eye.
9330 2018-05-07 03:25:31 my new favorite sleepytime diffuser blend:

9331 2018-05-07 03:25:13 Don’t ever put peppermint oil in your bath!!!
9332 2018-05-07 03:25:06 Oil surging again as the markets await Trump's decision on iran, renegading on the deal struck by Obama will cause much unrest in the Middle East with iran saying there will be serious repercussions. No wonder oil price surging.
9333 2018-05-07 03:25:00 Finally watched Deep Water Horizon , R.I.P to those falling oil field workers 
9334 2018-05-07 03:25:00 Think the weed molecules bind better to the oil than butter. It’s cause of the science-osity of the chemistry of the weed. The TNC and whatnot
9335 2018-05-07 03:25:00 A 1-2 hour bath while reading What to Expect When Expecting has become a Sunday ritual... A Touch up on my toe nails & a massive oil down is also required after.
9336 2018-05-07 03:24:59 This season is the craziest shit I've ever seen. Absolute circus.
Can't even watch it makes me so ill.
Let's go with Connor and the oil being to Vegas what LeBron and the Cavs are to Toronto.
It makes sense.

9337 2018-05-07 03:24:50 In positive news: Emperor @Jkenney and @ucp_caucus  announces plan to convert abandon northern oil camps into breeding facilities for pregnant teenagers, now forced to carry fetuses to term as per party policy.
9338 2018-05-07 03:24:42 Great. Please explain how in 50+ years there has been every movement towards for proffit hospitals, pharma, medical care, oil wars, prisons and any number of other neoliberal policies in dem controlled years of govt. How any of that equates to dem desires for helping people?

9341 2018-05-07 03:24:03 Randomly talking to a stranger about coconut oil
9342 2018-05-07 03:23:56 Actually I believe the statement only mentions not funding “Greenfield” Oil Sands projects. They specifically don’t mention investing in current/existing oil sands projects.

9344 2018-05-07 03:23:40 The office that's moving you isn't evil or incompetent, but it is overwhelmed. Especially this time of year (PCSs are scheduled by all svcs in May/June for several reasons.) The squeaky wheel gets the oil...
9345 2018-05-07 03:23:27 In the UK there's TKMaxx instead of TJMaxx, Oil of Ulay instead of Oil of Olay, & Pantene is spelled the same but pronounced "Pan-ten." Interesting to see the subtle ways brands change btw different (mainly) English-speaking markets to accommodate accent & dialect. cc @Halcyon_L

9349 2018-05-07 03:23:03 The #OOTTmoron s here keep propping up the Iran deal narrative. US inventories are up since the beginning of the year (and they'll be going up more this year). This is a phony rise #WTI #OOTT #Oil #CrudeOil #Brent #OPEC #CL_F

9354 2018-05-07 03:22:20 If we shut the oil taps tomorrow, the country would grind to a halt and our 2% (or less) contribution to the global co2 wouldn't make a lick of difference.
9355 2018-05-07 03:22:16 Pretty hypocritical of you when your wearing a cool hat made out of oil-based materials. Boomers brought you that oil that you take for grand.'makes you think !!
9356 2018-05-07 03:22:13 I love @snooki so much but if this is true I know my girl is micro tearing her skin.
Swap the kitty litter for sugar and coconut oil 
9357 2018-05-07 03:22:04 When oil drops $10 in the next few weeks you’re gonna delete that tweet. You’ll see.
9358 2018-05-07 03:21:58 Industrial farming practices and new technology made their jobs obsolete. Now they're mostly working in the oil industry or they went to school for white collar jobs. A lot of them are for second amendment reform and simplifying the partway to citizenship for immigrants.

9361 2018-05-07 03:21:45 okay but have you tried drinking coconut oil mixed with apple cider vinegar?
9362 2018-05-07 03:21:30 You speak as if Pruitt were an independent agent. He is a hired hit man. He’s been bought and paid for by Big Oil, esp. the Kochs, his entire career. He is simply obeying orders (conveyed, no doubt, via the ludicrous ‘cone of silence’).
9363 2018-05-07 03:21:24 Getting rid of the Iran deal somehow helps Russia make oil money.
9364 2018-05-07 03:21:17 But make sure you dilute the tea tree oil before using it
9365 2018-05-07 03:21:04 2 problems w/ that attitude:

1) If ppl's lack of critical thinking skills allows them to believe in extraordinary claims w/ little evidence, what other snake oil can they be suckered by?

2). Ppl go into voting both to vote on candidates and issues based upon these false beliefs
9366 2018-05-07 03:21:04 SA plugs are so whack I’m just try a buy oil 
9367 2018-05-07 03:21:03 2/ A competent forward thinking government who cared about ppl and environment would have a plan that would invest profits from oil gas etc..into programs to create clean energy source, roll out changes so impact on ppl economy managed, create new jobs opportunities industry.
9368 2018-05-07 03:21:01 I just got the one from Walmart tbh.

9374 2018-05-07 03:20:23 @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @IngrahamAngle @USAWatchdog Can you tell the truth we arent stupid and news today is global. Iran been sanctioned since 70's. Well SWIFT is not the only game in town and oil can be bought in yuan. Iran is backed by Russia&China seek peace
9375 2018-05-07 03:20:22 YES！LET'S OLIVE OIL！！！！

9381 2018-05-07 03:19:22 LOL. The Twitter preview showed a block of wood so I thought that was what they were calling a croissant. I opened to get a better look. That's worse than the block of wood. Needs lots of olive oil and cheese substitute to get that down.

9384 2018-05-07 03:19:09 SINGAPORE (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices rose above $70 a barrel on Monday for the first time since November 2014, as a deepening economic crisis in Venezuela threatened the country’s already tumbling oil supplies.
9385 2018-05-07 03:18:57 Cbd oil is AMAZING
9386 2018-05-07 03:18:46 Another really good combo w/ carrots is tangerine juice/little water, honey or brown sugar, butter/oil, sage fresh/cinnamons stick. Sauté carrots in butter/oil, remove, add all the other stuff. Cook down until syrupy - add carrots back to finish.
9387 2018-05-07 03:18:46 Scheer blamed low oil prices on trudeau??  No he mentioned a lack of action or "failing to stand up for our energy sector" on turdeau.  But these claims could apply to most canadian issues so no slight to the energy sector.  Oh wait for it......it's Harpers fault!!
9388 2018-05-07 03:18:41 So what if gamiton nako ang akong insomnia oil diri sa meeting, will I fall asleep? Hahaha
9389 2018-05-07 03:18:40 Maybe a government who's yearly budget depends greatly, if not exclusively on oil revenues and wouldn't want the supply glut.
9390 2018-05-07 03:18:33 Implementation was a rushed job. Oil price was falling fast but 1MDB debts were due. Do first, think later. But the think later part never went thru properly anyways.

9397 2018-05-07 03:17:35 This is an aggression against the Yemeni people by Saudi and the UAE with the complicity of America, Britain , in order to plunder the country's wealth. There is oil and gas equivalent to three world oil and gas reserves. It is in the northern border between Saudi and Yemen

9407 2018-05-07 03:15:03 There's a traditional spaghetti plate my Great Grandmother used to make called aglio e olio. It is spaghetti with anchovies, olive oil, garlic, capers, and of course Parmesan. Absolutely delish.

9422 2018-05-07 03:13:29 Reduce liquid first - I add a touch of olive oil - light with butter. I don’t add any liquid on the stove - just sauté carrots in butter/oil add aromatics/spices, then honey at end. At this point you could add some reduced liquid - let it carmelize slowly.
9423 2018-05-07 03:13:22 @swiggy_in @SwiggyCares Dear We ordered punjabi food last night from Juggad Nights. It was horrible!!! Full of oil & spice. Please stop dealing with them. They will spoil your reputation. Hope u hv system of prior checks before getting into tie-ups with food outlets!!!

- keeping your hair braided also helps your hair grow sometimes as long as you keep it oiled.

9427 2018-05-07 03:12:37 Where is the oil supposed to go? China and Asia. China is reducing oil  use as fast as possible and they just created their own oil exchange.  OPEC jumped right in. Higher quality oil and they control the exchange. Sorry, tar sands are dying fast, adapt or die too.

Agreed.

9444 2018-05-07 03:08:45 If ever we needed proof that the petroleum industry is not acting in the interests of NZers, just look at the pricing scandal. Oil companies are rigging their prices and ripping people off while taking away massive profits. It's time to #EndOil.

9455 2018-05-07 03:07:26 If you watched one of the videos that I posted a link to, it is very disturbing. They talk about greater Israel, Americans looting oil, religious wars waged by Saudi Arabia, CIA and Mossad blowing up the World Trade Center, etc.
9456 2018-05-07 03:07:23 Listen, kitty, I mixed my remaining CBD oil with regular e-juice in the hopes that it wouldn't fuck up my lungs like it did when I vaped the straight oil by itself. It did.

9461 2018-05-07 03:06:54 lol, the pipeline never made economic sense. This is a con by the oil company to suck in all the fools.
9462 2018-05-07 03:06:32 FYI..high crude oil means nifty has appreciated by 50%
9463 2018-05-07 03:06:30 Prediction, based on how Trump has operated in the first 16 months: he is not going to rip up the Iran deal, not now anyways. If I were a betting man, I'd short oil and cash in in a few days when it drops $5/barrel.

9488 2018-05-07 03:03:34 It’s the best! Toss florets in olive oil, S&P. Add cumin or herbs if you like. Roast at 400 for 30-45 min depending on how brown you like.  C likes hers with Franks hot sauce; I like with fresh lemon. Great to add to salads for heft.

9514 2018-05-07 03:00:23 Exactly. In fact our oil should sell for a higher price in the world because of it.
9515 2018-05-07 03:00:11 #OutstandingResults Shea!  A #P2 finish the first time out surely made everyone over @Bubbaburger just as happy and proud as I am right now.  #Congratulations to you all!  :-)
9516 2018-05-07 03:00:05 Drink more motor oil for nutrition?
9517 2018-05-07 02:59:37 No. Japan was the clear cut aggressor in WW2. They invaded French Indochina for resources, so the Americans cut off their oil in retaliation. That meant Japan had to go to war. To win that war the U.S. Pacific Fleet had to be destroyed from the start.
9518 2018-05-07 02:59:19 Does it make any difference? Trudeau wants to shut the oil industry down, Weaver knows blocking it is the only way to survive, Horgan knows to stay in power he needs Weaver, First Nations civil unrest.......

9528 2018-05-07 02:57:03 2) Dilbit is NOT more corrosive than "crude." Diluent is just a lighter hydrocarbon than crude oil. Nothing special about it. And why is it less safe to transport? Bitumen is oil. It's just less degraded than light sweet crude, and it's mixed with clay, sand, etc. It. Is. Oil.
9529 2018-05-07 02:57:02 そうだよーーー(￣▽￣)
9530 2018-05-07 02:56:57 You're right, oil still needs to be much higher

9534 2018-05-07 02:56:20 @realDonaldTrump If you want to slow Russia down... Don't let crude oil get above 75.00 (below 50) in fact, the low it is the more leverage we have. We can do it by pushing for more efficiency as we drill.

9539 2018-05-07 02:55:06 I am for a real energy paradigm that will replace oil and gas. It must be universal portable and cheap. Likely to come out of research into the basic forces of attraction and repulsion in the atom.  Donna, your eyes are turning pea green from all the bile.

9541 2018-05-07 02:54:50 1) It's not useful to know that there are sources of oil with lower carbon-intensity ("cleaner") than bitumen if you don't understand that light sweet crude does not compete with heavy. It's not interchangeable. AB competes w/Venezuela, Mexico, etc not Texas or ND.

9546 2018-05-07 02:53:57 Yes - that is true  , Petro alleged backed by extra heavy Ayacucho crude reserves - which may or may not get out of the ground. So , while Petro pitched as oil backed , it really isn’t. Also PDVSA owes Rosneft 6bn in debt.

9548 2018-05-07 02:53:50 Perhaps but I think estimates of demand are too high, because we're on the cusp of a major shift to electrified transport and a move away from single use plastic. With increased production from fracking oil prices will stay low.

9551 2018-05-07 02:53:14 I just started watching Psych at 10:00pm on a Sunday night wearing nothing but boxer shorts and compression socks, while eating seaweed tossed with sesame oil & now I am thinking... wow, this is my actual life - just how I imagined it would be.
9552 2018-05-07 02:53:14 You're probably dead on. This is not a joke, back in the late 1990s the oil mandarins in Kelowna blamed increasing gas prices on too much competition in the local market. I shit you not.
9553 2018-05-07 02:53:09 I have no idea and I don't really care. I'm a trader... If oil we're to vanish I would simply trade something else.

9570 2018-05-07 02:49:42 I cooked with olive oil for this diet thing I’m on. But that’s beside the point. I cooked with it and it feel so light. Not like other oils.
9571 2018-05-07 02:49:38 And let me guess @CNBC this would be Trump's fault? This has been going on for years the oil companies ALWAYS find an excuse to raise prices and line their pockets and NO ONE CALLS THEM OUT ON IT now that would be a great story
9572 2018-05-07 02:49:22 @MarksmenEnergy Cmon , time for the results. We have invested and waited patiently, oil at prices not seen in 4 years. its go time!

9574 2018-05-07 02:49:14 WWE is saying that Zayn's reason for missing the Saudi Arabia show is a medical condition.

I hope that oil money was worth it, Vince, hope it was worth it. 

I also hope some talents up and leave when their contracts are up. #WWEBacklash #WWENetwork
9575 2018-05-07 02:49:09 The reason Desert Storm occurred was because Saddam invaded Kuwait and almost controlled half of the worlds oil supplies. Yes, the first attack did occur. The Second attack likely didn’t
9576 2018-05-07 02:49:06 Witch hazel and tea tree oil on my face every night is so soothing.

9578 2018-05-07 02:49:01 That’s exactly what the Christos oil is lol as above so below.
9579 2018-05-07 02:48:56 Something about drenching your body in coconut oil after a hot shower that makes you feel like you’ve really got your shit together. I be looking at the Jergens like “bish you basic ... and sticky”

9583 2018-05-07 02:48:25 Here’s the truth, Franklin is a snake oil salesman who dupes sheep out of cash.
9584 2018-05-07 02:48:14 おはよー！ゆっくり休めたかな？体に気をつけて過ごしてね！
9585 2018-05-07 02:48:11 The point is that there are sources of oil that are cleaner, than the tarsands so it’s useful to know that for comparison. Dilbit is more corrosive and less safe to transport than crude. Tarsands is a more effective label to me because it’s a source of dilbit not oil.
9586 2018-05-07 02:48:03 In 11 years, there were 51 deaths of oil and gas workers in Colorado alone. And that's only the 7th highest nationwide.

W/ few unions, oil workers are electrocuted, burned alive, crushed, and struck by pipes or heavy machinery while trying to do their job.
9587 2018-05-07 02:47:38 The "ignorance" is people that believe weed fixes everything.  It's the snake oil of the century.  It's now taxable, so now it fixes everything? You yell "healing" and I hear taxible fraud backed up by fake studies paid for by the industry and beneficiaries of tax dollars.
9588 2018-05-07 02:47:38 夜勤の周期早くない？？今日明日夜勤で明後日休みでその二日後にはまた夜勤でうそだろこんなに早いものなのか夜勤
9589 2018-05-07 02:47:09 @AllenLone oil at prices not seen since 2014, thats 4 years ago... so whats up with v.moo and all the stories you told of 50-70 dollar oil being the catalyst. WCS is even above 50. I know your not a people person, however informing shareholders is a legal obligation

9595 2018-05-07 02:46:01 We should do more, we should improve fuel efficiencies and we should cut emissions - but Joe Taxpayer should not foot the bill. We have paid for that time and time again. The Auto companies who were not efficient should pay. The oil companies should pay.Not the taxpaying public.
9596 2018-05-07 02:45:57 Solid weekend for @shawnfricke with an E2 finish in S/St and E4 in S/C.  Going rounds is always good. @1320Travel @Lucas_Oil #CompetitiveSuspensionSolutions.

9598 2018-05-07 02:45:48 Always put your BHA down before your AHA, if you’re gonna layer acids. BHAs are oil soluble so they will clear your pores and allow better penetration of your AHAs. You’re welcome!
9599 2018-05-07 02:45:45 Do you ever worry about oil spills
9600 2018-05-07 02:45:39 Also their herbed pizza dough, their “Soft Multigrain Rustico Bread,” I freeze it then toast it with cream cheese for a quick bfast! Also their olive oil is cheap but  chocolate covered pretzels, frozen falafel on their Mediterranean flatbreads, AND THEIR LEMON BARS

9602 2018-05-07 02:45:22 They dropped “antiquated” concepts like chivalry, and advocated for “total war”. Because bombing cities like Dresden would demoralise enemy troops on the front.

Even more recently, war on terror has killed millions, radicalised survivors, fuelled terrorism. Wars for oil & profit

9614 2018-05-07 02:43:54 Keep buying with the 99% sheep dude. Good luck with that trade. Massive drop coming. Largest drop oil has seen in years is around the corner.
9615 2018-05-07 02:43:42 TIL that when using a gas generator, and it says check the oil level often, you need to turn it off and then check. If you check it while it’s running, it will spray hot oil all over you, your patio, and your patio furniture. So I hear.  #ONStorm

9630 2018-05-07 02:41:45 Not sure what point you're making. Oil sands heavy crude is not the same as light sweet crude. Or medium crude. But there are dozens and dozens of distinctions between the types of light, medium, and heavy crudes. Bitumen is not some evil outlier.
9631 2018-05-07 02:41:28 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
9632 2018-05-07 02:41:28 It's 11pm and all I can think about is how I wanna slice up that mozzarella in the fridge and eat it w olive oil and vinegar and Basil

9634 2018-05-07 02:40:53 Lol.. What is that freebie thing in venezuela?? Dont create ur own assumptions. The inflation in venezuela started with the unstable oil prices, dictatorship and with no government reforms. Their economy is entirely dependent on oil and hence a small slide created worstinflation

9638 2018-05-07 02:40:09 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.
9639 2018-05-07 02:39:57 so far their match at the oil Rumble was their best one in this series. Many can say that we have been spoiled by NJPW because well it's the fucking truth because those were wrestling matches not a real for ball shots like a film from the early 00s #WWEBacklash #WWEChampionship

9641 2018-05-07 02:39:55 Yea football is weird. 

Still, I’d rather this without a shadow of a doubt than having some oil cunt buy my club and buy a bunch of trophies like the chavs or city or PSG. 

I’ll always at least have a begrudging respect for Arsenal because the club earned its success

She is selling snake oil. Haspel won't cower to Trump.
Also, war is a crime yet we still wage it as well.
9658 2018-05-07 02:37:10 You don’t fry with Virgin olive oil, sir Teddy, because it gives out a bitter taste. You can however use regular olive oil not the Extra Virgin kind. :)
9659 2018-05-07 02:37:08 hi adam. out pf curiosity, whats u long termn outlook for oil? will it vanish to a newer energy, or will we keep seeing its utility?

9665 2018-05-07 02:36:10 Why doesnt America ask saudi for the money considering most of the terrorists came from saudi arabia!!??
No this is just to demonise Iran and fuel the fires of hate via the west to make it easier to attack/invade oil rich iran. (1953 anyone?)
9666 2018-05-07 02:36:07 Canadian oil is being discounted to access our only market, the US. And more so with recent increased US production, thus less need for our oil. Recent action and/or inaction of the trudeau government is what's at issue.
9667 2018-05-07 02:35:54 "You ready to die for oil, boy?"

9670 2018-05-07 02:35:46 If tweets below 1/2 right, what chance does Mueller have in overturning richest point of power in history: Big Oil Republicans, Israeli, US Rel Rt. & “Christian” Russia? (Graham takes Putin’s word he’s Christian what w all that oil) How much headstart do they have on Mueller?
9671 2018-05-07 02:34:45 Some of it was stored in some kind of barrels, not oil, smaller, but the other forms they used to poison others for a sole purpose of creating excuse for war against my clones, seriously, was in round discs.  The mossad was involved too.

 ( ´―` )
9673 2018-05-07 02:33:40 It's one thing to make peace deals at $70 oil, and quite another to expect them honored at $300 oil, without a notarized carry warranty.
9674 2018-05-07 02:33:35 They are now, but 30 years of PCs giving the oil industry carte blanche is tough to overcome.
9675 2018-05-07 02:33:28 Oh i actually have a good recipe that uses potatoes. I dont use it often bc it requires so much oil.
9676 2018-05-07 02:33:15 You wanna talk about bringing tracks back, Let’s throw Lucas Oil Raceway and Memphis on there. Never a dull race at thise venues

9678 2018-05-07 02:32:38 Iran is a big export market for the European companies also a source for below market  priced oil, natural gas and other commodities.
9679 2018-05-07 02:32:31 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.

9689 2018-05-07 02:31:38 Good questions - most recent data I see -China is  Venezuela debt owner at 23bn , in exchange Venezuela sent 330,000 barrels of oil to China. Russia is a lesser debt holder w/3.15 bn of Sovereign debt restructured this past November-payable over 10 years (PDVSA debt  excluded.)1

9695 2018-05-07 02:30:56 Last December the Kochs, Putin and the Saudis agreed to cut production of oil. Without the State Dept. to hold them in check we are headed to another financial meltdown.45's supporters do not understand this bc they're  morons. And bigots.
9696 2018-05-07 02:30:50 I'm switching from oil, tbh. All electric currents from here on out.

9706 2018-05-07 02:30:00 And oil just hit $70 for the first time since 2014.  Good job Ford !
9707 2018-05-07 02:29:55 국제유가가 70을 찍었습니다. 이스라엘이 이란을 진짜로 줘팰지 궁금해집니다.
Crude Oil is above 70 per a barrel. Now What I'm really wondering that if Iran is hit by Israel.
9708 2018-05-07 02:29:51 With Oil Marketing business mostly dependent on vast cross country pipeline network, inventory gains are bound to happen in rising crude scenario. Cross country product pipelines are runfull at 120 PSI. I hope you have considered these factors for OMCs.

9815 2018-05-07 02:13:05 2/2 I'm also pro pipeline because I think oil serves many purposes beyond "energy". When I'm in the mountains my outer layer is head to toe petroleum products. I want that to be transported in the safest, most efficient manner. i.e. Pipelines over rail/trucks

9857 2018-05-07 02:05:58 So today I went to get my oil changed and when the dude came over to me he started asking me questions about the car he asks me about 5 different questions and then pauses and he says “what year is this?” And me thinking he was talking about the actual year says “ummm 2018”

9859 2018-05-07 02:05:44 So my suggestion is letting your skins oil levels return to normal, by just washing your face with water for a few days, you can scrub and all, but just water and then use a gentle facial cleanser and moisturizer after

9863 2018-05-07 02:04:30 Mmmmmmmmm. Will try it. Portillos in Chicago has a chocolate cake that is to die for. The trick they use is mayo instead of oil and eggs. They also make a chocolate cake shake. Vanilla shake with a piece o the cake thrown in the blender.

9876 2018-05-07 02:02:46 Per @CNBC: Iran is currently the third-largest oil producer in the Petroleum Exporting Countries and the fifth-largest globally. The return of sanctions on the country could result in as many as 1 million barrels of Iranian crude supply being wiped out and push oil prices higher.
9877 2018-05-07 02:02:35 It’s oil and gas stuff
9878 2018-05-07 02:02:30 I went with my highest-smoke point oil, which today was peanut oil. Not ideal, but I guess I used all of my avocado oil. Then I drop a tablespoon of butter in there when it gets hot.
9879 2018-05-07 02:02:16 Pour a little oil over the surface and it won't go mouldy right side up either. Why? Flaky seal after vacuum is released.

9898 2018-05-07 02:00:12 Greenhouse gasses are caused by Manure as well  not to mention palm oil is used in a variety of VEGAN alternatives? Talk about hypocritical  why do vegans always have to be so obnoxious about their opinions.
9899 2018-05-07 02:00:09 Wouldn't the refiners be able to blend even lower octane fuel with the e15 then they do the e10 thus making them more money if the blend is raised to e15? maybe I'm doing the math wrong but sounds like a win for both sides so let's leave the rins alone you greedy oil companies

9902 2018-05-07 01:59:49 President Theodore Roosevelt said the best thing we can do fou our National Parks is to preserve them for our children and our children’s children. My heat is broken that the GOP under @realDonaldTrump and Scott Pruitt are destroying these wild areas to benefit oil and gas. God !
9903 2018-05-07 01:59:37 I realized after chucking SO MANY products that I haven't touched in a few years that are filled with chemicals...that you only need a few things to get by okay: 1. white vinegar 2. baking soda 3. coconut oil 4. witch hazel 5. Dr. Bonners
9904 2018-05-07 01:59:36 Cut out any non fruit/vegetable based carbs. 
Then eat a lot of healthy fat. 
1 whole avocado
2tbsp of coconut oil
1/2 cup raw pumpkin seeds
It will take about a week to adjust but once your body learns to use fat as energy you’ll feel great.
9905 2018-05-07 01:59:09 Just to pick on one : "Reduce dependency on foreign oil". From the party that, if they had their way, wouldn't let us still anywhere in the US. Inconsistent much?

9907 2018-05-07 01:59:03 Sear in a pan for two-3 minutes a side on medium heat with a small amount of olive oil, once both sides have been seared, place pan in 425 oven and bake for 12-14 minutes. 

Sprinkle natures seasoning on them before cooking.

9925 2018-05-07 01:56:37 Eating out tips (part 2)
3. Make sure you don’t go starving to a restaurant/ TELL THE SERVER NO BREAD PLEASE!
4. Don’t be afraid to ask your server to help you make your meal healthier. Like replacing fries for salad or ask them to prepare it with less oil or cheese.

9934 2018-05-07 01:55:31 Nothing in the "real economy" of Venezuela (price of oil or availability of goods and services) justifies it's hyperinflation. It has to be an artifice of economic manipulation. Not hard to believe there are powerful bad actors with enough motivation to push for economic collapse

9939 2018-05-07 01:54:29 I think this is why more people need to learn about climate change. Elon Musk is actively trying to get us to a point where renewable energy is the norm, while most Billionaires (including Trump) actively fight against it and try to make us oil dependable forever. Life be damned
9940 2018-05-07 01:54:13 Loving the weather but I don’t burn or tan or anything nothing happens??? I could put a bucket of baby oil over my body an the sun would be like haha not today luuuv
9941 2018-05-07 01:54:04 Yes. The Taranaki thing. She gave the oil companies a heads-up that they will soon have NZ at their mercy. Pretty cool ay.?
9942 2018-05-07 01:53:56 We get a raise , we buy more gas, Big Oil sees this, so they raise the price , but your going to blame the president for giving us more money. Despite what you may believe the U.S. gov't does not own the oil company, maybe you should see who does, it'll blow your mind!

9949 2018-05-07 01:51:50 Dude, Obama opened the Arctic up for oil drilling not once but twice!!! It's just that the media didn't report any of it because they were in collusion with the corporate Democrats.
9950 2018-05-07 01:51:42 I’m guessing she used cooking oil or olive oil.

9985 2018-05-07 01:46:49 If we need to reduce fossil fuel use by X%, instead of debates on taxes, simply impose limits on oil drilling/coal mining and reduce those limits until you have reached x% reduction. Let market price carbon;. @JustinTrudeau
9986 2018-05-07 01:46:37 Or more nuclear.  Equation of nuclear with oil and gas in energy-return-on-carbon terms very hard to believe to say the least, given numerous studies indicate nuclear carbon intensity similar to wind & better than solar
9987 2018-05-07 01:46:37 Well said. Have known dogs to die after flea treatment with tea tree oil.
9988 2018-05-07 01:46:15 How is the Mediterranean plant based different then other plant based diets? Does it include olive oil and olives?
