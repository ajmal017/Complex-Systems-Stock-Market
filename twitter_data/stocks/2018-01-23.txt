38 2018-01-23 23:47:51 My 401K has diverse stocks also and that is good.  I agree people should be able to advance themselves and reach their goals.  I’d like healthcare for all and affordable college to open up that pursuit for more people.  I suppose that is part of me that is liberal to some.
39 2018-01-23 23:47:09 I don’t mind $LIB at all, my largest holding is $RKS which holds a number of good ones, so I sold my $LIB off a few weeks ago for more mining stocks for diversity.

49 2018-01-23 23:40:27 Absolutely.  As it is the beginning of turnaround season, stocks had to be built up.  Yet rbob remains below the 5 year average. There will, as their should be, stock builds, for the next several weeks.  Multiple seasonally smaller than average builds are bullish.

74 2018-01-23 23:29:21 These are great, Jim. Thanks for sharing! Momentum "feels" so non-evidence based to us value conscious investors! But at the least, I think value conscious investors can make sure they don't screen out these stocks!
75 2018-01-23 23:28:41 That would be a start. Bump stocks and large-capacities restrictions would help. And, in any event, anyone who desperately needs to have an assault weapon, IMHO, needs mental therapy.

91 2018-01-23 23:16:19 Obama wildly succeeded, facing historic conservative obstructionism. 

Our economy, foreign policy success (many, such as his framework on combating ISIS, Iran deal, OBL dead, worldwide respect), jobs, stocks, $1.4T lower deficit - all due to him.

He handled NK like an adult.
92 2018-01-23 23:15:46 HODLing no matter the price is TERRIBLE investment advice.  Absolutely terrible. Even the buy-and-hold king, Warren Buffett, later regretted holding one of his favorite stocks through the tech bubble.

115 2018-01-23 23:01:12 You're pro mass shootings and against common sense regulation? Bump stocks serve NO other purpose than mass death and casualty. Last I checked, Jesus wasn't Rambo, what's with Christians worshiping guns?
116 2018-01-23 23:00:19 Eventually needs to split, not many stocks over $1200. A stock split is usually done by companies that have seen their share price increase to levels that are either too high or are beyond the price levels of similar companies in their sector.
It adds no value, just strategic.

133 2018-01-23 22:52:34 My stocks and investments have done great since the end of the recession and have continued at the same line of growth. So yes, one additional year on top of the previous years has been good.  I may move the money to safer investments soon As Mueller gets closer.....
134 2018-01-23 22:52:04 I certainly am not a top income earner in this country, but stocks are part of my 401k mix. It doesn't take a lot of effort to sign up for your 401k or get a Roth IRA. The fact that so many people don't have stocks should not stop the rest of us from earning some extra money. :)
135 2018-01-23 22:51:00 Scared to say it, but I don't remember the last time we've had a down day. Parabolic returns with more to come. Something big has changed in America, animal spirits are back after a whole decade since Bush destroyed the economy. #Stocks are on fire.
136 2018-01-23 22:49:12 I'm tryna see myself, im just noe getting into stocks, I'm jus relaying possible  good info
137 2018-01-23 22:48:36 Another sick day for stocks with major tech players making more big moves. FAANG on fire. Nvidia Netflix Tesla. Great day to be a GK client! $FB $NFLX $AAPL $TSLA $NVDA $GOOG $AMZN
138 2018-01-23 22:48:25 Apple stocks are only 177.04 wtfff I could of thought it was much higher then that wow
139 2018-01-23 22:48:13 I was mostly pointing out the fact that our technology is constantly listening to what we say without us knowing... But also, yeah everyone should invest in stocks too
140 2018-01-23 22:46:37 No it isn't stocks, but technical analysis and any financial asset with a chart works the same no matter if it's Forex, Stocks, Crypto, etc. For example, BTC formed a double top before plummeting, just as you'd expect it to using technical analysis.
141 2018-01-23 22:46:05 Stop please, the deal with Putin was clear after Eastern Ghouta 2013 : no retaliation in spite of Bachar's deliberate crossing of red line vs no more stocks or uses of CW, guaranteed by Putin.
But chlorine barrels all along years 2014/15/16/17 and Khan Shaykhun as an apotheosis.
142 2018-01-23 22:43:29 Cryptocurrencies still have a long way to go to become an actual value for the majority of people and for those who is fond of stocks markets. Being sceptical about someone's attempt could be wise but that is the way things happen: the first one takes the market
143 2018-01-23 22:42:47 A lot of hot air.  Some people have too much time on there hands if all they do is sit and bash penny stocks.
144 2018-01-23 22:42:35 Greed is obviously still good in America. I own stocks, digital currency and even traded in regular currency and I would never be concern only for my wallet and not think of the less fortunate. Develop some morals, lady.
145 2018-01-23 22:41:57 Bump stocks are not even the problem. That was only one case.  The problem is much more complex and deals with a skewed and form of masculinity, among other things.
146 2018-01-23 22:40:22 Market Close: MBS +22bps; DOW -3.79; NASDAQ +52.26; S&P 500 +6.16; 10yr Treasury 2.62%; Yields drop below 1st resistance, helping MBS rebound, and stocks closed mixed.

148 2018-01-23 22:39:19 What news sources do you monitor regularly for news on stocks?
149 2018-01-23 22:38:02 That’s something I am struggling with. There was a lot more value in 2000 than there is today. The number of cheap stocks is limited and heavily concentrated in retail.
150 2018-01-23 22:37:25 Stocks close higher as earnings lead with signs of being overbought.
151 2018-01-23 22:37:14 Exactly. Now more than 15 companies from Macy’s to Starbucks. Also,
My taxes go up 10k this year, so hope everyone is touting a great Econ has a ton of stocks, otherwise...
152 2018-01-23 22:35:03 No you did not TELL anyone to invest in bitcoin. But your let's say enthusiastic tweets on the rise of bitcoin as a investment strongly implied they should get in on it. Like I say the best most reliable(long term) investment are stocks!
153 2018-01-23 22:34:59 Iv got a semi
154 2018-01-23 22:34:51 We need to find a way to manufacture solar energy panels here in the US. Maybe then he can shove his tax in his big mouth.
His pals with utility stocks can pound sand 4 all I care. They’re all greedy lying whores.
155 2018-01-23 22:34:02 If you are upset you missed the stock market rise check out Inovio (INO). Do not make any decision on what I say. Do your own due diligence. Bio stocks are a huge gamble.

We may never see it again in our lifetimes.

Anyone buying stocks here is gambling.

No houses left for the British? 3 out of 4 kids born in London are not English descent! Control of fish stocks/borders! Paying membership to unelected club. Whatever you say pal, I vote leave
167 2018-01-23 22:31:24 I don't even think anything has been done about "bump" stocks which turn a semi-automatic rifle into an automatic rifle (Las Vegas shooter).  N.R.A. has a strangle hold over the G.O.P..
168 2018-01-23 22:30:21 TIL: Cash = EM Stocks
169 2018-01-23 22:29:41 Thank you to President Obama for putting policies in place that keeps on giving us jobs, Trump is so excited about the stock market because he is profiting while most Americans don't have stocks and will suffer under his tax bill! #TrumpRaisedOurDebt already!
170 2018-01-23 22:29:29 The most effective and emotionless TA comes from stocks, commodities, coins,etc that you do not have a personal interest in trading.... ironically.
171 2018-01-23 22:27:47 They have always been extremely difficult business to turn profits and horrible stocks. The sector had improved  but if we heading into another period of "capacity wars" I think its back to same old same old...
172 2018-01-23 22:27:47 What’s funnier is Kurt claimed recently that he has beat the US stock market gains since the election. Claims he invested in overseas stocks instead and has outperformed the S & P. Can’t make this shit up.
173 2018-01-23 22:27:36 Multi-national companies do not care about worker.  Their allegiances are to share holders.  How many uneducated 45 disciples have stocks?
174 2018-01-23 22:27:06 I’ll have plenty of time to invest in stocks after I graduate and find a job
175 2018-01-23 22:27:00 WTI/RBOB Slide After Surprise Crude Inventory Build ?

Didn't seem like a surprise to the oil stocks, they were weak all day in the face of crude up 2%...

Apparently someone knew...

#trading #oil
176 2018-01-23 22:26:30 I'm a lawyer. I expect people to disagree with me. But your argument was downright offensive.

Even if we assume that bill was a real attempt, then why did the Republican congress refused to fully fund it?

Meanwhile, they've blocked any attempts at gun control, even bump stocks.
177 2018-01-23 22:25:25 Going to start up my stocks run

182 2018-01-23 22:19:19 The gun industry is holding its biggest annual trade show just a few miles from where a gunman slaughtered 58 outside his Las Vegas hotel. The show features a display case with many weapons that are fitted with bump stocks that enable them to mimic fully automatic fire....
183 2018-01-23 22:18:39 $JZBY holding steady...ready to burst when news drops. Most brokerages have this as "Hard to Borrow".
184 2018-01-23 22:18:23 Stocks inched mostly higher Tuesday, leading the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to clinch new record highs.
185 2018-01-23 22:17:56 Bump stocks? We're trying to shut a government down here. We can't possibly schedule time to talk about banning bump stocks.
186 2018-01-23 22:17:32 Unfortunately, the time is near for you to be correct.  These ladies couldn’t settle on what color nails they wanted but were assessing risk in stocks   Geez. Now i know how JP felt
187 2018-01-23 22:17:03 Is it more of them being #1 after losing 4 out of 6 scorers or losing 4 out of 6 drama queens?
188 2018-01-23 22:16:37 He did deny it...and just go ahead..believe what you want...stocks are up because of confidence in Trump...he’s a businessman...Daniels is a red herring...but go ahead...believe what you want...I’ll stick with the President...
189 2018-01-23 22:16:15 So $vix is not down coz they are buying protection as well as stocks??
190 2018-01-23 22:15:44 I just was having my nails done. Only male there N all the ladies who were having their nails done were discussing investing in stocks n that it is smart to take on more risk for continued excess yield return. I choked on my laugh n thought of your blog
191 2018-01-23 22:14:29 First let’s have them in stocks for a month on the DC Mall. Would be good for tourism.
192 2018-01-23 22:14:16 Remember when that dude gave up all his stocks and told Americans to do the same cause Trump would crash the market. LOL
193 2018-01-23 22:14:10 Or if you prefer, you can use stocks, as in '99 or 2000. Or, in the same way that in every KOF you can choose one-on-one battles, you could choose classic three-on-three mode. Which would play like the original 2002. Choose any three characters from the roster of four-slot teams.
194 2018-01-23 22:13:52 Pssst...”background checks, no bump stocks, and having to pass a psychological evaluation for gun licenses” IS “gun control”.
195 2018-01-23 22:13:25 I have written u before mostly because I have been a bull n you a bear BUT I m sure you know the story of JP Morgan getting advice from the shoe shine boy to buy stocks.... well
196 2018-01-23 22:13:00 That depends upon how many pints I have on Friday evening, my prowess with scissors and local stocks of tin foil. 
'One' would be something of an achievement.
197 2018-01-23 22:12:56 Yea Cus Jus Like Stocks Go Up Stocks Go Down Sooo Your Money Can Duplicate Or Precipitate It Jus Depend On How The Stock Do In The Market
198 2018-01-23 22:12:11 I think you need to trust yourself - especially in illiquid stocks - as that is where the edge can be found. Remember, anyone not in a stock will be unnecessarily bearish. It's wise to listen to others but ultimately make and have faith in your own execution.
199 2018-01-23 22:10:52 End of Bushs term with the bank and Auto industry but I was even Obama create for that. I even thank Obama because of the ACA my stocks options are up 540%, and my industry still gets billions in subsidies.
200 2018-01-23 22:10:45 Just invested a good chunk in stocks and crypto, lol. Let's see how this goes.
201 2018-01-23 22:07:55 You got better but for stocks overlay them
202 2018-01-23 22:06:35 ah mdr bah ils vident les stocks hein même si c moche tout doit dégager
203 2018-01-23 22:06:26 I define “transfer of wealth” as the gov taxing one group and giving it away in the form of “benefits” 
People that work deserve to keep more of their money gov only wastes it. 
Biz should make profit it’s how they stay in biz, pay employees etc. my IRA has HC stocks so all good
204 2018-01-23 22:06:22 Plus, many of these 'unicorns' have so much variance of return/drawdown, that a typical 'buy and hold' mindset (behavioral finance) will never hold on to these stocks during the major drawdowns.
205 2018-01-23 22:05:58 Not necessarily heavy but more exposed to tech stocks, try to trade less tech on this account because tech stocks are so volatile.
206 2018-01-23 22:04:16 Everyone with a 401k owns stocks. It's part of the relatively normal dream of retirement and essential to building wealth for most Americans..
207 2018-01-23 22:03:43 Always happens in stocks. Everyone's pre-mad over there.
208 2018-01-23 22:03:07 No, I'm accusing you of failing to admit you were caught up in a talking point and pushed an NRA myth that the GOP does something about gun violence after "thoughts and prayers" when the evidence is clear that they don't. The GOP wouldn't even block bump stocks.
209 2018-01-23 22:02:48 I believe that the EU's stocks of skim milk powder will be sold in the next 6 months. That could take place at a 30% discount. After that, dairy protein prices likely will rebound, Kevin Bellamy @RaboFoodAgri #DairyForum

211 2018-01-23 22:01:45 Stocks up 1.32% today
212 2018-01-23 22:01:32 I do plan to hit the stocks again after I eat.I also had some ideas to work around the hotfixes Blizz doesn't even know they are going to implement yet. Let them play the same old game of checkers. I'm playing 4d chess this time.
213 2018-01-23 22:00:32 @jaketapper WHAT it still stocks to Clinton.... but perfectly fine for this Orangeman... got it.

216 2018-01-23 21:59:26 I get the momentum phenomenon. I don’t get the momentum factor being used as performance attribution for active management. I mean, shouldn’t good stock pickers be holding the best performing stocks???
217 2018-01-23 21:58:02 stocks quite weak today
218 2018-01-23 21:57:56 true, and let's go ahead and add that it's a "black box" since none of us know which stocks they'll add or remove in advance.
219 2018-01-23 21:56:54 Hey @TeamCavuto please correct you guest and explain that not all 28 MILLION businesses in America are publicly traded and they cant buyback stocks or pay out dividends. @FoxNews

27+ Million businesses in America are small businesses and THEY got Tax Cuts too.
220 2018-01-23 21:55:35 @mihomes Lol..Mihomes abandoned Twitter it seems. How about own up to the stupid crap you put your clients through for a change.
221 2018-01-23 21:55:08 Let's bring back public shaming. Stocks up in the town square, rotten fruits in baskets near by, and canes for a nice whack on the legs?
222 2018-01-23 21:54:50 Hello! Based on Yesterday's Stock Market Close - 2018-01-22, these stocks have buy signals based on a Mean Reversion Strategy (6/6):
223 2018-01-23 21:54:38 I imagine that for those folks it's a matter of convenience.

Most people don't withdraw all the cash out of their checking account every payday and stick it under their mattress. Similarly, most people who want to buy stocks use brokerages instead of buying through DSPPs.
224 2018-01-23 21:54:08 So what? There is no speculation in FOREX or in stocks?
The big difference is that speculating in ICOs can be done with what a cup of coffee costs and in FOREX or stocks you need a few thousand.
Loosing a few cups of coffee means nothing... one of them bring a trully

These are the type of friends everyone should have.  And I’m more than appreciative to have that.
261 2018-01-23 21:42:44 Not a trade boycott absolutely not! Just a marketing decision about how long you choose to hold your stocks...

266 2018-01-23 21:39:16 Hmmm, that's actually interesting. Shorting penny stocks. That's virtually guaranteed.

268 2018-01-23 21:38:59 Apparently you do not understand that if you have any money in a bank or a financial institute,  you have investments in "stocks".  93% of all Americans have a bank account.  Their money in that bank is in stocks.

i'm currently 83.6% gold miner stocks, a bit more risk than most have appetite for
278 2018-01-23 21:31:37 As a former active duty Marine, I support the 2nd amendment. Though, I think items like bump stocks should be listed as a Title 2 weapon and require a more thorough background check.

286 2018-01-23 21:30:08 Mine was not taking profits. It was more so my early days in penny stocks but still applies.
287 2018-01-23 21:29:57 So go buy some stocks dude. Don’t whine like a baby, make a move. It’s a free country.

292 2018-01-23 21:29:12 aye that's fine, just most folk for gaming will use 1 or 2 each. Several examples have been circulating of individuals/couples buying 50+ / entire stocks for mining. General issue with prices soaring, supply, etc for folk who just want a new gaming card x.x
293 2018-01-23 21:29:03 In the digital age of #cryptocurrencies, the old ways of making money (such as equities and stocks) are boring and exchanging money with fiat currencies is really outdated. #bitcoin #Ethereum #BitcoinCash #Litecoin #wearethepeople

295 2018-01-23 21:28:56 I tried stocks in August. This is the first time I've been positive since that day.

297 2018-01-23 21:28:41 All those with 401K or IRAs own stocks!
298 2018-01-23 21:28:27 YES Oh my gosh YES! There was a loss of HOPE b4 @POTUS Trump. Businesses moving BACK to USA, JOBS, stocks-401K's...by NOW no one should question that this last YEAR has been better than 8 under the oppressive economy of Obama. Anyone can ignore the facts, but FACTS they ARE!
299 2018-01-23 21:27:24 Consistency has never really been that important to me but I do tend to gravitate towards the same film stocks over and over: Superia, C200, Portra and Ektar. Especially the first two!

301 2018-01-23 21:26:17 def going down the rabbit hole on etf - it more and more reminds me of portfolio ins in 1987 - and knowing equity repo as i do, the liquidity assumptions of stocks, nevermind etf, are mind boggling - good night

306 2018-01-23 21:24:02 starting yield, starting cape, starting VIX, starting inflation, etc. for the trend rule, is it comparing relative stock and bond performance or is it 100% stocks if stocks > 10m SMA?
307 2018-01-23 21:23:44 @BioLordVR not yet, but that is just a trade account. i trade other stocks in it. I am fully loaded otherwise. been here for 1.5 years.
308 2018-01-23 21:23:20 $WTW   Bottom line : Stocks don't go down for no reason, If there is bad news, a downgrade, something - then, but all is good with Queen @Oprah

310 2018-01-23 21:22:25 Which is even dumber in the long term:  raises allow for more investment into mutual funds/stocks to grow the national economic health in addition to individual retirements.
311 2018-01-23 21:22:18 You must not have read my tweets.  I’ll state again:  those convicted of domestic violence cannot own guns.  The mentally ill cannot own guns.  Limits on ammunition.  Bump stocks illegal.
312 2018-01-23 21:21:13 Have you, as a gun shop owner, done anything to stop mass shootings and sale of bump stocks.  Didn’t think so.  ONE TERM TED       VOTE @KathyManningNC for NC13....a real American patriot.
313 2018-01-23 21:20:45 I have had $ADMP in my retirement portfolio. Absolutely bad choice. Could have sold it a lot higher and bought other stocks. Still expecting something this quarter hopefully before earnings.
314 2018-01-23 21:20:22 I've only been trading stocks on the side for a few years with chump change, but I'm looking at these numbers and I'm liked "these increases make no sense. This is unsustainable."
315 2018-01-23 21:19:33 Bump stocks are attachments actually change the speed/firing of a gun, but whatever. Clearly you don't understand guns.

319 2018-01-23 21:16:03 In Switerland, we call it "Notvorrat" - plus, the army has stocks hidden deep in the mountains. :-D
320 2018-01-23 21:15:36 Being able to inconsistently take stocks early does not mean that you can consistently take stocks period, just like how Mario struggles to kill in spite of his fsmash and fair (not a perfect analogy, but something like that)
321 2018-01-23 21:14:03 i need to invest in some stocks

323 2018-01-23 21:13:10 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to treat your fibromyalgia
324 2018-01-23 21:12:50 Are you following the cannabis stocks here in 
Canada
325 2018-01-23 21:12:09 You could serve customers better by spending $ on voice recognition and other security technologies that protect customer’s hard earned $. My accounts were spoofed by an imposter. 41k worth of stocks sold and transferred over the phone.

327 2018-01-23 21:10:34 Thanks Harps, I use Microsoft excel at work so seemed more convenient. I was also looking to bring in data for every UK stock rather than 1 specific stock, but if google brings in the quote page that’s handy to monitor owned stocks
328 2018-01-23 21:09:40 I can buy them anywhere—the point is the Running Room only ever stocks the most stereotypically "feminine" colours in their shops when there are literally over a dozen available
329 2018-01-23 21:09:35 Hi Sahara. U sound a bit bearish. I c a lot of bullish engulfing candles on U.S. metal stocks at the close today. It could even be a recognition day. We'll see.

332 2018-01-23 21:08:13 I hope you had sold those stocks before Christmas  but crypto currency and block chain technology are here to stay. People just gotta do their homework and not buy into the hype
333 2018-01-23 21:08:02 If bump stocks were illegal, Vegas would have been a different story.

335 2018-01-23 21:07:37 Stocks rebound from morning lows to close mostly higher, led by techs.

Dow -0.01% but S&P +0.2%, Nasdaq +0.7%, Russell 2000 +0.4%
336 2018-01-23 21:07:11 This is a country that wasn’t able to rouse itself to ban bump stocks after 59 were shot dead. We are inured beyond all reason.
337 2018-01-23 21:06:21 S&P 500 and Nasdaq hit record highs as tech stocks rally. Dow closes slightly lower. Netflix soars 10% on blockbuster subscriber growth.
338 2018-01-23 21:06:07 Trump did not deny his affair with Stormy Daniels.  Regardless, why would I sell my stocks and 401k because Trump is a sexual abuser?  The first year of any economy is attributed to the past president.  A fact I’m sure that Fox would hammer daily if the economy was doing poorly.
339 2018-01-23 21:05:54 Are you and your friends having conversations about life insurance..owning property..land or stocks..???
340 2018-01-23 21:05:25 What I think is really happening is Obama’s economy was and is relevant, so much so that Wall Street may be having a hard time making the adjustment for the sell off of stocks. As a result they are taking wacks at the strong Economic areas.

349 2018-01-23 20:59:56 I don’t use banks at all I invest my money in stocks, Roth IRAs, gold and silver. I have a safe and a private safety deposit box. I’m a 5 time felon so I have no empathy for “those poor people” I started with no credit no job and now make 100,000$- 120,000 dollars a year.
350 2018-01-23 20:58:51 A big part of Obama's pension fund is invested in shares of
gun industry stocks. He was the greatest gun salesman ever #fastandfurious too.
351 2018-01-23 20:58:45 Why ban bump stocks?
Because of that phony Las Vegas fiasco?
No one with that kind of money would bother using 32 'maybe it works, maybe it don't' bumpstocks when he could afford a real military rifle.
352 2018-01-23 20:58:41 Monetary pressure. Most the FBI Black Hats own stocks, commodity futures, hedge-funds, etc. that benefit from offshoring US Mfg --facilitated by Clinton Global Intiative, & corruptly procured trade & fiscal policy. IMO, insider-trading is thier motive for protecting the Clintons.
353 2018-01-23 20:57:46 @KuyaSilver where do you see junior mining stocks on ASX going in 2018?
354 2018-01-23 20:57:33 this is insanity, who gives them authority to dilute purchasing power of currency to buy stocks? WTF
355 2018-01-23 20:57:16 I see. Strange when 80% of Americans don't own stocks. Ask any economist if things are overpriced right now, you might be surprised. What it fall as better investments come online internationally dear. Hoarded money goes where it wants.
356 2018-01-23 20:57:05 She does have a pretty good X factor, but I'd call someone like Ryu more consistent at closing out stocks and getting the big damage he needs, as he has to commit far less to landing a shoryu or dair than we do for a witch time. Also just a small thing, dair is our worst aerial

366 2018-01-23 20:55:21 New tax laws to provide mixed response for housing market. Stocks modestly higher after positive earnings results. JPMorgan to raise wages, hire more workers and expand its business.

Let's see this on paper.... let's see how these restricted stocks work... and these employee raises... also why does trump hate Obama so much... tariffs on clean energy...
And is Mike pence a Russian spy?

368 2018-01-23 20:54:50 Thanks to @ModernShamann for showing me robinhood. Stocks rolling.
369 2018-01-23 20:54:17 For 'Investors',There are still a ton of value buys available in the market. 
Don't misinterpret the expected intermediate top as an indication to get out of equity market. Revise the portfolio.Lock profits in hot stocks which look pathetically overvalued. Value hunt. #investors
370 2018-01-23 20:53:48 Ok, thanks. This basically answers my question I had for you: if you still favor small cap/low float stocks? (Yes:  $VAC 22M, $OPY 9.5M, $NC 3.7M and $CRCM 11.4M). Then $MZOR (18M) is on your list too?

372 2018-01-23 20:53:32 Today @PressSec said exactly what @TheDemocrats said That our money we paid into US Treasury through taxes which was stolen to give to wealthy donors was being used by companies to buy back their stocks albeit Verizon to cover the move gave a minimum shares to some employees
373 2018-01-23 20:53:32 Proste za cenu obvyklou v miste a case. Navic to nejsou firmy spriznene, ale stejneho majitele. To je absurdni oprsklost, kterou by financak normalne netoleroval nikomu.

375 2018-01-23 20:52:49 I love how you Plebs know exactly which stocks I hold and do not hold. It is quite comical seeing you make assumptions based on your own pitiful logic 
376 2018-01-23 20:52:43 @jimmy_dore you are not being honest on discussing all these companies, giving bonuses, stocks and raises to non management employees !!!  be fair jimmy !!!!
377 2018-01-23 20:52:00 I was just thinking the same thing.  Maybe a stop/sell order at say 23,000 (or whatever its called) would be a good idea, I don't know, don't know much about stocks but hate to lose any money, i'm way up right now. What do you think?
378 2018-01-23 20:51:38 Its great to see the Telegraph doing a news article on my good friend Charles Munger. He has been instrumental in Berkshire Hathaway's growth for many years. While the article mentions so much of what I have taught him, he has taught me so much relating to stocks over the years.
379 2018-01-23 20:50:50 Does anyone else buy stocks in gaming companies? I was thinking about buying into Tencent.
380 2018-01-23 20:50:50 You could start with banning assault rifles and large capacity magazines and bump stocks?
381 2018-01-23 20:49:33 I do own stocks and I am retired but that is not enough to accept this worthless self loving buffoon
382 2018-01-23 20:48:41 My theme for 2018 so far has been 'rocks & stocks' $GLD $SPY I think it's going to be a theme for a while
383 2018-01-23 20:48:30 If you measure the cheapness through the CAPE on both SPX and bonds, stocks are still cheap compared to bonds (1987 vs today)
384 2018-01-23 20:48:25 have you looked at bigger $/cap stocks? seems to be working for those folks pretty well but not my cup of tea (smaller account / no PDT)
385 2018-01-23 20:48:10 84% Of stocks are owned by the richest 10% so yea for them I guess

528 2018-01-23 19:42:38 Maybe if the bottom falls out of stocks GOP will wake tf up.
529 2018-01-23 19:42:10 Have to ask, do fundamentals even matter any more?  I look at stocks today with the biggest gains, and I see one thing in common. None of them are profitable!  Take a look at one of the biggest gaining (and most hyped) stocks out there: TSLA - EPS  -8.60
530 2018-01-23 19:41:57 Good- handcuffs wd be useful- they won’t like the stocks, with 99% of populace lined up with rotten eggs and tomatoes!
531 2018-01-23 19:41:12 @MarkYusko great call as always - ! I asked who buys us stocks ....stupid indeed
532 2018-01-23 19:40:54 Stocks have been on a continual rise since Obama. Learn your facts please.

536 2018-01-23 19:38:23 Great to hear from you! Sorry took so long. Lots going on, as you know! I produce a NEW Key List each night. Scan lists from the results of my screens. Also always check news @IBDinvestors  for new stocks. Do this 2 - 3 times/day. Hope that helps!
537 2018-01-23 19:38:17 It's Wine Tuesday everyone! Don't let your stocks get low. Stop in and save 20% when buying 2+ bottles or boxes of your favorite wine. Hope to see you!!
538 2018-01-23 19:38:12 I own stocks too & when I began buying many years ago, I was probably in the lower 4 percentile! Lived paycheck to paycheck because I always put a small amt. towards savings! In 40 yrs, I have a nice retirement fund! @wrobby123 Bogus!

540 2018-01-23 19:36:18 So, the military is issuing "bump stocks" now? Explain to everyone how thats the same as select fire? #gunsense
541 2018-01-23 19:35:59 But, there is no plan without risks. Need to have the discipline to stay the course. Look at stocks as businesses that need to generate profit to survive.

552 2018-01-23 19:30:59 What is a "rate increasing device"? Its clearly intended to be ambiguous and will quite easily become a semi auto ban or at the very least ban certain magazines, triggers, bump stocks etc. Check the actual interview with the former ATF guy on Military Arms Channel or IV8888
553 2018-01-23 19:29:41 Kinda sorta getting the itch for more investment. Bought my first crypto currency last night, my very small bit of stocks and bonds are slowly growing and I like my chances. But I've gotta take care of bills first before i get in any deeper.
554 2018-01-23 19:28:52 OBAMA AND TRUMP SUPPORTERS - UNITE OVER STOCKS! The S&P 500 gained +26%  during the 1st year of the Trump administration, i.e., the 12 months from HIS 1/20/17 inauguration through 1/20/18.   It did EVEN BETTER during President Obama’s first 12 months, gaining over 37%
555 2018-01-23 19:28:43 My new trading rule: so long as  @realDonaldTrump is president, do not short stocks of real companies; ONLY short when democrats are in control

563 2018-01-23 19:24:46 True
Not for beginners
It has to be for stocks or coins that's been affected by a macro not micro hit.

That is something cut across the industry that isn't specific to the company/coin
564 2018-01-23 19:24:36 It's remarkable how little you understand economics. & that you're seeing the effects of 8 years of obama stability. At bare minimum presidents don't actually control stocks. ( which went up more in 1st yr under obama with better jobs figures too )

610 2018-01-23 18:54:02 No, Obama INHERITED a recession with high unemployment & stock market under 7,000. He turned it around, cut unemployment from double digits to ~4%, stocks up to almost 20,000. Trump INHERITED a growing stock market, low unemployment. Those are the FACTS.
611 2018-01-23 18:53:46 So basically stocks as an asset class tend to TREND.. Either UP, DOWN or SIDEWAYS

If u can identify wat is th current trend.. You can take advantage of it.. For eg if u believe the trend is UP u can stay long.. If SIDEWAYS then u stay away and don't waste time

616 2018-01-23 18:51:07 #WDHR - ~ Rapidly growing broad-market sales 
Yet another reason there's been a lot of buzz surrounding marijuana stocks is the rapid sales growth and potential within the industry. Regardless of the source, pundits expect significant yearly growth from the legal weed industry.
617 2018-01-23 18:50:45 Everyone know and feels the announcement of smash 5 inc. (at least people are ready for it) and all I ask if for one thing.

618 2018-01-23 18:50:35 $WDHR !! A massive new sales channel on the horizon 
A third reason marijuana stocks were on fire in 2017 is the expectation that our neighbors to the north, Canada, will legalize adult-use pot by July 2018.

626 2018-01-23 18:46:17 Wall Street projections alone are an inaccurate assessment of the economy because companies can just buy back their stocks to increase their stock prices.

630 2018-01-23 18:44:28 Yeah, UK is arguably cheaper than US, and also buffett can't buy small stocks etc so it's not necessarily a no-brainer to copy him. For us there may be better options than cash, debt/mortgage repayment, pension contributions ( with generous tax relief). Maybe p2p lending?

677 2018-01-23 18:17:36 Do you think 30 round magazines should be restricted? Bump stocks?50 cal. ammo?
678 2018-01-23 18:17:20 I guess I do similar without necessarily codifying it as a Framework. What I find though is you can read several articles on same Company and all have different view. Trouble is that taints my own thinking and it's often detrimental. No surprise as all Stocks have Bulls & Bears.
679 2018-01-23 18:16:35 google apparently trades 1.2 million stocks a day
680 2018-01-23 18:16:21 Agreed.  As that date draws near, what will happen to stocks (up)?  What will happen to USD (down)?

689 2018-01-23 18:11:29 Only 50% own stocks. Trump gave Corporations a trillion dollars, of course they are going to buy their stock back= stocks go up. Duh.
690 2018-01-23 18:11:05 I had like $70 in stocks and a couple weeks ago I took all but about $9.50 out... now that $9.50 is up to $11. Fml. I should’ve left the rest in. 
691 2018-01-23 18:10:50 Seems that way on almost all stocks
692 2018-01-23 18:10:49 So their talking about ban bump stocks federally but some states have banned or put major regulations on them but really if someone wants to require it illegally then they can, it's very easy
693 2018-01-23 18:10:42 Good morning, #investors! (I was up til 7 doing cocaine) If you let another man pick your stocks or “manage your money” you are weak. Would you let another man fuck your wife?

700 2018-01-23 18:06:12 Seems like the retail investment thesis is that they expect a 50% melt-up and are FOMO. Buying stocks on the hopes of rampant speculation another sign of the late stage bubble.

703 2018-01-23 18:04:28 The irony is that stocks with lots of sells these days (like $CACC) generally are skyrocketing. So they also lose out if they are wrong. Buy calls are never considered “wrong”
704 2018-01-23 18:04:15 So what I’ve come to understand is that farmers are paid bullshit for all the work they do compared to the big guys sitting behind their desks and animals are used as stocks and bonds and whipped out because humans are just greedy. This is disgusting.

733 2018-01-23 17:56:13 You said your investment advisor recommended for you to keep your stocks. You didn't. Now you're saying that you had no information that would've suggested that you should've kept your stocks. Nice.
734 2018-01-23 17:55:29 So when stocks crash, and you lose your money & he'll be of no use to you anymore? You'll all come to your senses then? Because that's the only false claim to fame he keeps repeating verbatim like a broken parrot! I wonder if Stormy put her $130,000 "hush money" into the market?
735 2018-01-23 17:55:14 Start with the US Coalition of Terror stocks: “US Secretary of State: All Syrian chemical stocks should be destroyed”
736 2018-01-23 17:55:12 You're still paying more every month: (mortgage + property taxes + repairs) > equivalent rent. That's more money that could be invested in stocks over the mortgage duration. Far from 5x true effective leverage.
737 2018-01-23 17:54:23 why are you people even trading BTC like other stocks and currencies. It has entirely different fundamentals. price pushed down weekly by threats of regulators to ban it and then it rebounds. Its not moving because of traditional trading forces. 100k ppl a day opening accts.

745 2018-01-23 17:50:32 The issue is more so, if a player is new to competitive Smash and sees Bayonetta getting crazy early stocks and ignoring neutral, it might not look fun and may push them away.  It's not as much about how enjoyable it is for current players as it might be for newer players.

751 2018-01-23 17:47:56 Huh? You can just sell it. Stocks are way more liquid than your home.

Person B puts $100k into S&P in 1995. Today they have $500k liquid.

764 2018-01-23 17:42:47 So I think adx will big the biggest bust of my time in stocks. You guys still holding? And for what reason other than you have no choice? Or does your dd still say something massive is coming from them? @Techcenterr

766 2018-01-23 17:41:20 Yes probably though not their main choice. Have seen them taking hawthorn 'stones' in Ampleforth churchyard, Stocks Reservoir and here in Gilling in early December. With yew and hornbeam running out they will probably increasingly turn to different foods.

768 2018-01-23 17:40:28 Sweetheart we don’t make enough money to risk investing in stocks. We put our money in low-interest but secure savings accounts or CDs because we cannot afford to lose the little we can save. I think many are like us.

770 2018-01-23 17:39:52 The top five stocks higher at noon today are $RMD, $NFLX, $TRV, $GE, and $HRB.
771 2018-01-23 17:39:37 Running a portfolio, rather than only holding a couple of stocks, allows the the trader to cut the losers much more quickly, especially in the company of winners in that portfolio. It's psychologically much easier to cut them that way.
772 2018-01-23 17:39:23 Unfortunately we do not have access to a central stock system for store stocks as these can always vary throughout the day. To check other stores stock you will need to contact the stores directly. Our deepest apologies, Ross.
773 2018-01-23 17:39:16 Ahh. Bet you listened to the FakeNews media who said that the economy would suffer and the stock market would tank if Trump was elected right?  So you didn't invest and missed out on a golden opportunity to make a killing in stocks over the past year.  Hmmm....SUCKS to be you!
774 2018-01-23 17:39:10 The top five most active stocks at noon today are $GE, $BAC, $AMD, $F, and $NFLX.

776 2018-01-23 17:38:40 Stocks like this $fat and others are all long shots.  Unless the junior has $10-100mil in the bank for proper drilling program. Might as well buy scratch tickets.
777 2018-01-23 17:37:41 What's the matter? You believed the CNN experts who said the economy would tank and the stock market would implode if Trump was elected, right? So you didn't invest and take advantage of the once in a lifetime opportunity to make a killing in stocks?  Gee.  Sucks to be you.
778 2018-01-23 17:37:12 You win some you lose some. i have made a lot of money on 3-4 stocks out of 10 stocks i usually hold. but i never know when 3-4. hence i never reco stocks here. expecting every stock to earn money is quite foolish and impractical.
779 2018-01-23 17:36:45 I bet he owned some bump stocks
780 2018-01-23 17:36:34 I can't imagine 2 stocks doesn't exacerbate that frustration.
781 2018-01-23 17:36:18 Buying stocks ahead of earnings calls makes me very happy.
782 2018-01-23 17:36:01 One of the winners on the UK250 was Pets at Home , which has been one of the most shorted stocks on the U.K. indices, the retail equity was up  5.9% after the  company posted like-for-like revenue growth of 7.2% for the 12 weeks to January 4
783 2018-01-23 17:36:00 Over 50% of Americans own stocks and the large wealth effect with increase spending and job creation will help millions of more people. Also, this will help pay for the welfare going to millions of more Americans. So, a large majority of Americans will be better off
784 2018-01-23 17:35:54 Low barrier to entry at the moment; everyone’s an expert. Even beach club owners can get involved - talk is cheap. Waiting to hear your advice on what biotech stocks you’re shorting. Otherwise looks like you’re being compensated by electroneum for promoting their product.

791 2018-01-23 17:34:12 Well, you have the old tradition of the village stocks and rotten cabbages. That could be revived.
792 2018-01-23 17:34:06 APAC equities outperformed in today's session, with the Nikkei up 1.3% on a dovish BoJ meeting and the Hang Seng rising over 1.6%. Mainland Chinese stocks joined in, with the SSEC up 1.3%
793 2018-01-23 17:33:18 So you listened to #FakeNews who said that if Trump was elected, the economy would suffer and the stock market would tank and you missed out on the VERY rare opportunity to make a killing in stocks.  Gee, sucks to be you.  But keep believing the b.s. CNN et al throw at you.
794 2018-01-23 17:33:14 rest of tweet: ...valuations... and less than 1% were at low valuations. 6 mos later there were over 50 stocks at low valuations. today we have 65% of stocks at hi valuations. Caveat Emptor?
795 2018-01-23 17:32:29 I’ve spent the last month studying the cryptocurrency world and I’ve come up with some lessons.

Participate to an ICO only if a company answers in its white paper to the investors’ most urgent question: When Lambo? #bitcoin #ethereum #litecoin #btc #eth #ltc #xrp
796 2018-01-23 17:32:21 Actually, no, my parents don’t have a retirement fund with stocks. About half of Americans don’t. Of those that do, stock ownership rates are skewed significantly toward the wealthy.
797 2018-01-23 17:32:17 IMO stocks are absolutely insane here because all the money that usually goes to bonds are now being placed into stocks...because people are scared of rates.
798 2018-01-23 17:31:57 Anyone know anything about stocks ? 
799 2018-01-23 17:31:19 All talk focuses on investment opportunity. When will we assure the world community about good returns on their investments. No one is going to come for charity. That's why most of the foreign inflows are focused just on stocks, not on CAPEX.

802 2018-01-23 17:27:07 Let’s remember: markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. Sustained up trends much much easier to catch & ride than downtrends. Hope springs eternal and overvalued stocks just keep going up!

805 2018-01-23 17:26:45 Timestamped: Ray Dalio says investors will "feel stupid" unless they're long stocks. Stocks whose prices have never been more detached from their own sales (Price-To-Sales) or the macro economy (all GDP growth 100% correlated to debt growth and now ST interest rates are rising).

807 2018-01-23 17:25:42 LMAO, So are you independently wealthy, already retired ? Or maybe if you're not retired you are waiting on living off of SS if it's even still there. Most responsible Americans are invested in stocks someway through a retirement acct. Maybe you've heard of a 401k or IRA ??
808 2018-01-23 17:24:43 C'est le modèle de l'hyper qui a atteint ses limites. La multiplication des moyennes surfaces de proximité à moins de ¼ heure avec un personnel peu nombreux et polyvalent et des stocks faibles à rotation rapide absorbe de plus en plus d'achats. @antoinesire

812 2018-01-23 17:24:26 I had dinner at a professor’s house last night with other CHP kids and it was basically 3 hours of listening to the Business major talk about investing in stocks while the rest of us politely sipped on our mineral water/acted like we had the $$ to invest in anything

824 2018-01-23 17:19:35 You have quite diversified portfolio, what are you worrying. Just let it run on its own. don’t  let stupid market influence you. These funds hold reasonably priced stocks and would do well too .
825 2018-01-23 17:18:41 Junk ICOs are the real risk to bitcoin.  The internet stocks in '90s, baseball cards, & real estate in 2000s each fell after influx of low quality product caused faith in the whole asset class to collapse.  Interestingly, in each case prices for high-quality eventually rebounded.
826 2018-01-23 17:17:15 lol appears no one wants to buy this "crash" on bitcoin and blockchain stocks while it's often compared to dotcom I remembered it to be different in terms of timeframe and magnitude of the moves between then and now

828 2018-01-23 17:16:37 well, i dont understand how does Ray dalio know indian company valuations? he buys ETF. So he may be talking about short term momentum or economics. for india i see even if market don't correct, returns are going to be pretty bad for most of the stocks
829 2018-01-23 17:16:04 If you have a 401k, you invest in stocks...  half of Americans???
830 2018-01-23 17:15:18 it's one of those stocks that everybody wants to be in, because of the story here.. it's just the CEO dropped the ball big time over the past several months. If he can pull through, there will be thousands of percent gains again. ran from .0001 to .0105 on hype.
831 2018-01-23 17:15:17 you do realize that the Dow is made of up of just 30 stocks of huge corporations - they are what is driving the surge in the stock market - large corporations that just got a great tax cut. Even those in the stock market most down own those.
832 2018-01-23 17:14:33 Ride, I mean
833 2018-01-23 17:14:25 I tried the waves too, only I got a shitty entry
834 2018-01-23 17:14:22 If the off the Richter Scale propping up of the bond market fails to lift stocks, expect direct propping up/buying of stocks to occur by the banks themselves via dark pools. This is all fake... No real price discovery whatsoever in this market.
835 2018-01-23 17:14:21 Nope, not "bye bye Second Amendment".  Bump stocks aren't firearms.  They're a modification to a firearm with absolutely NO practical use.  Dangerous in the hands of some who doesn't know how to use them.  Meant to skirt control of fully-automatic firearms . . .
836 2018-01-23 17:14:11 @jpell1975 bitcoin did that double bottom thing again if it pops to a new high I feel it takes this and at lot of other stocks with it
837 2018-01-23 17:13:47 If the #Budget changes the fortunes of the stocks you own, you’re invested in the wrong businesses

839 2018-01-23 17:13:24 Zerohedge is pretty good and on point with stocks/crypto stuff.  Usually has some other stuff out there, before the big news gets it. But yeah I get what you saying.

848 2018-01-23 17:11:17 Invest a part of your savings, not the earnings, into stocks! 

So if you have decided to invest 25% of your savings in stocks, invest 12% to 15% as it is a risky business. Also you should only invest a certain amount based on your risk-taking capacity.
849 2018-01-23 17:10:56 9:38 AM : Stocks have started the day mixed. The Dow is -26.59 at 26,188.01 and the S&P 500 is +1.87 at 2,834.84. Mortgage Bonds are +16bp at 101.44. via @mbsHighway

853 2018-01-23 17:10:07 I agree with Abhishek. Market has been giving crazy valuations to NBFC stocks because of their blistering growth pace with relatively decent asset quality. So dropping loan growth levels or rising delinquencies would be big worry signs for me. Canfin shower the former.

895 2018-01-23 16:55:10 I think the hardest part is just riding the lows and not selling out of panic. The answer to that is buy good solid stocks(companies) and hold them because,, they always go back up again. Boeing, IBM....

897 2018-01-23 16:54:39 @OnPointRadio 401k is ok with employer match only. Stocks will crash again because of Trumponomics in 2yrs. Bitcoin is better. Blockchain tech is taking over e-commerce.

Spoiler alert- all these companies are “overvalued” but just coz u own a certain stock doesnt mean rest are garbage. Deal with it

925 2018-01-23 16:39:23 The sad thing about this is it is reall very easy to create your own wealth with stocks. Anyone can do it. But many are too afraid to do it. Open a Fidelity account with $25. Buy 1 stock . Once you get started you will see how easy it is. Hold that stock. Not rocket science.
926 2018-01-23 16:39:09 @MoneyGoose and i think the markets overbought just saying it IS a positive for stocks but it’s old news

933 2018-01-23 16:37:11 About 2/3 of my portfolio is invested in Chinese funds, which have kicked booty for the last year or so. I rolled over my wife's VALIC acct and put that into domestic stocks in November - great timing, huh?  They're up over 17% since!
934 2018-01-23 16:36:58 How do you do that, specifically? ETFs? Buy actual panels? Put all your money on stocks from a single vendor?
935 2018-01-23 16:36:10 What is a lie about the Las Vegas shooting being the deadliest mass shooting in modern history?

945 2018-01-23 16:33:51 in uptrends stocks making new 52 week highs or ATH 
in downtrends stocks making new 52 week lows are alright for shorting but still I avoid shorting because in stocks bias is mainly of buying..also in case of uptrend one can always stay bullish on the general market i.e the index
946 2018-01-23 16:33:46 Clear message.

952 2018-01-23 16:31:46 They haven't banned bump stocks. And Mexico is NOT paying for the wall, either directly or indirectly.
953 2018-01-23 16:31:27 Whining?  No whining, demanding.  Most Americans support back ground checks, eliminating bump stocks, not selling guns to domestic abusers/mentally ill.

 Why a person can't pay in cash if a person already declared his GST number while purchasing stocks. 

GST number already give the details of the stock which a person buy then it's compulsory to pay in cheque not in cash!!

967 2018-01-23 16:26:14 The long term return of stocks (with dividends & reinvestment incl) is around 10% per annum (over about 250 trading days).  We've achieved 60% of that in 2018 in 15 trading days.  Last year was a great bull year and we have almost 30% of last year's return already as well.

1054 2018-01-23 15:57:35 Penny stocks are definitely lacking major volume today. Most of the attention is placed on the larger market caps earning season! But every day is a new day, so prepare today for tomorrow.

1057 2018-01-23 15:56:57 Index futures? Or are you refering to the fact that we have 70X more indexes than trading stocks? Passive investing is a PLUS? Your opinion, as said, while its a straight line, everyone has a good algo. I was here in 2000, 2002 and 2007/8. Same story
1058 2018-01-23 15:56:49 please don't tell me about how good the stock market is doing unless you own stocks. rich people making more money isn't really an improved economy in the way that you would hope

1063 2018-01-23 15:55:31 This is just patently false. Mutual funds in 401ks own stocks. We all benefit from the strong market.
1064 2018-01-23 15:55:19 Every time someone tells me how much their stocks have gone up, it’s easy to see what their price is. And I’m not talking about stock prices.

Penny stocks can give u extra income  for vacation.  Or a new car   Works for me!!!
1069 2018-01-23 15:54:23 Street Stocks yes!
1070 2018-01-23 15:54:05 Most people in the US “own” stocks and don’t realize it. They fund their pensions.
1071 2018-01-23 15:53:33 I’m bout to boss up on these long-term investments. Life insurance, 401k, and stocks are the move in 2018. I’m trying to win off these dividends. Not now, not next year, but give me 5-10.
1072 2018-01-23 15:52:55 A company is seen as an entity  and thereby accounted differently from the owners’ accounts; yes the owners/board myt prioritse sharing dividends to servicing debts but any borrowing done by the company through issuing of stocks is solely for the company and not the owners!
1073 2018-01-23 15:52:45 Volume looks very big as I have traded stocks that have lot size of 2000 and 3000.

1079 2018-01-23 15:51:48 This brings up an interesting point for those that don’t believe in momentum. Is there a preference to own 100-500 US stocks today and never buy new names / sell underperformers? Would love to see how that works over extended periods TBH. @alphaarchitect @daniel_egan
1080 2018-01-23 15:51:47 That would be another interesting data point. Also, where that money is stocked away, assuming it is in a 401k or stocks the market has been good over the past year.

1082 2018-01-23 15:51:11 The proposal brought to the table didn’t just ban bump stocks, it was very gauge and would have banned many other things including certain guns.
1083 2018-01-23 15:50:21 Banning bump stocks won’t stop bump firing. You can accomplish the same with a belt loop.
1084 2018-01-23 15:50:05 This is very useful since there is no screener yet to filter stocks by financial trend category. Hope the wonderful team at @Marketsmojo is working on introducing a screener in due course. It’s getting better and better.

1216 2018-01-23 15:03:11 As long as I can deduct capital losses, like you can with stocks, I don’t see why this is a big deal.
1217 2018-01-23 15:02:41 e.g. "investing in crypto is gambling", in that case, so is trading stocks or investing in a company, we have no idea how well a company will do, we can make assumptions based on facts and figures, but there will always be a risk. 

"its a bubble" It is a bubble. But from this..

1372 2018-01-23 14:00:42 In commodity stocks, markets dread supply. Demand is mostly linear. Supply is inelastic. Managing supply is always the key valuation driver.

1392 2018-01-23 13:49:35 When the market is up and every day and we have the best combination of bullishness for stocks and the economy it should be very overbought. The haters are on the sideline making nothing in CDs and bonds while others are killing it

1397 2018-01-23 13:46:59 $USDJPY: Still plenty of downside risk in days ahead, pointing to 107-108. 

Why? 

1) Trading back towards bottom of range that has been in play since early 2017

2) BOJ has been a little less dovish of late

3) Broad based US Dollar weakness

4) Anticipated pullback in #stocks

1429 2018-01-23 13:30:21 Who cares. I read income and financials when picking stocks. They are complicated enough when reading between the lines. There is no way anyone other than an excellent corporate accountant or the the IRS could discern anything from his filings. This isn’t your 1040.

1581 2018-01-23 12:07:44 As expected, Trump placed tariffs on imported solar panels and washing machines.  The consensus this morning is that its not the start of a trade war, Asian stocks closed higher, the Chinese response has been restrained overnight and the sectors involved are relatively small.

1623 2018-01-23 11:42:32 l wouldn't recommend ANYONE to invest at the Stock Market at the moment.  Those with stocks, held for a long period, are winning big - but only on selling.

1738 2018-01-23 10:25:21 Not all portfolios are falling. Many are. Some are rising and quite a few are flat. This is because large caps are moving while midcaps are lagging. It also implies that many folks do not hold index stocks in their portfolios.

Investor is someone who buys Midcap & Smallcap and then waits for his price to come, watching market hitting all time high.

1762 2018-01-23 10:07:07 Would probably go long on index itself, individual sectors may perform because of some 1-2 stocks which could be difficult to manage. By going long on the index itself one can take gains, without worrying about the performance of individual stocks.

1779 2018-01-23 09:56:04 The partnerships are the proof, this isn’t stocks; to have a stake in the company you must own the token. 75 banks partnered with Ripple and they get 30% less fees when they use it. if you think they do not have stake in a partnership you are being naive or untruthful.
1780 2018-01-23 09:55:54 But you can draw some conclusions from this evidence. It shows the US top 20% own 87% of total wealth, not the top 1%. It is highly unlikely what you said occurred. Moreover, I don’t count the value of stocks as real wealth until capitalised.

1799 2018-01-23 09:43:47 Now you're talking. But then stocks could still crash in real terms. Imo endless easing will eventually make people lose confidence in the currency, which could lead to a currency crisis. Interesting times.

1802 2018-01-23 09:39:44 I know. But it’s the speed of the increase that alerts you to take notice. Usually stocks rise by going 2 steps forward, 1 back and vice versa. The JSE’s rise is straight up with little pause. It leads observers to ask questions why?

1811 2018-01-23 09:37:25 I think you overestimate gold production flexibility and response time. In 2012, when price was peaking, it grew by 66 tonnes (2.3% of total supply, <0.04% of total stocks). In 2013, when price was falling, it grew by 161 tonnes (2.44x). Bitcoin predictable supply is superior.
1812 2018-01-23 09:37:10 "If the target stocks gain 10 percent, the notes should trade up 30 percent." How is this not a #Ponzi scheme? "the notes do not actually own those stocks" What DO they own?
1813 2018-01-23 09:36:09 $VAKRANGEE is trying to break 500 resistance. Once it breaks the stock will get closing above 510.

2070 2018-01-23 05:36:30 I think for me is that its hard to get the position size right with stocks in that range.
2071 2018-01-23 05:36:02 That’s assuming the valuation of wealth is correct.
If stocks, bitcoins an other stuff are overvalued, if we are in the everything bubble, then the top 1% are making a lot less than that.
2072 2018-01-23 05:35:23 there are a lot of stocks that would be nice if they pulled back..until we get below 10sma on daily...

2081 2018-01-23 05:23:32 One of the male anchor commented “ the fact that it was $220 last week and it's now $240. It's absolutely incredible” first of all, Netflix is a growth stock so it's very common to have a 10% growth in a week. Secondly, in this bull market, numerous stocks hikes more than that.

2095 2018-01-23 05:15:30 For those, who are stuck in 1 or 2 stocks....there is no rally....one of my friend stuck in Maruti at 9800 since Dec 20, for him there is no rally.....

2110 2018-01-23 05:06:08 While this is great, banning bump stocks or setting magazine limits on a state by state (or city by city) basis won't work, we need a federal reform of the weapons industry in this country, and we need it now.

2113 2018-01-23 05:05:42 That's one hypothesis for explaining why growth sometimes crushes value. I don't buy it though--I think it's mostly behavioral. Didn't really see it consistently from 2012-14 after yields crashed. Didn't explain late '90s either. Do think higher rates hurts junk stocks, small-cap

2122 2018-01-23 04:57:33 Yes it is dangerous, the concentration of power. *better than* pharma cos consolidating tho in that the non-profits have to reinvest the profit into its infra, expansion etc, as opposed to buying back stocks.
2123 2018-01-23 04:57:31 This rise in NIFTY in last 3 weeks is so irritating ... Only few big stocks like Reliance are taking market up everyday and rest are either down or neutral... 

Midcaps have been worse, small caps have been worst.
2124 2018-01-23 04:56:17 People with massive wealth usually have it in ownership and stocks. You can't sell it all without destroying the market. And you can't solve poverty by handing out money, that's just a temporary fix. New habits must replace old ones.
2125 2018-01-23 04:55:58 If the people are to gain power back we have to do it by taking billions back from the 1%. How do we do that? Make bitcoin rise so much that investors start pulling all their money out of companies stocks, make the conventional stock market crash & just push $btc up to the moon.

2135 2018-01-23 04:45:06 This is a really important problem. I know we use the Dow and the S&P500 to measure the economy but they are of interest to stock owners. We need another measure that is reported monthly that gets at the gap. We want to know how the 1/2 that doesn’t own stocks is doing.

2172 2018-01-23 04:23:00 The trick is not to learn to trust your gut feelings, but rather to discipline yourself to ignore them. Stand by your stocks as long as the fundamental story of the company hasn’t changed.

2173 2018-01-23 04:22:41 Remember when people said the exact same thing about tech stocks in 1999? I remember.
2174 2018-01-23 04:22:00 Growth stocks (ones with little/no dividend "coupons") are just an unsecured claim on future earnings. They are the longest duration "bonds" you can buy. 

If higher rates = bad for bonds, they're worse for growth stocks.

2186 2018-01-23 04:12:59 And all those costs were already passed onto consumers in anticipation. We all pay more to account for the taxes that will never be. Good time to own healthcare stocks. Just think, 8 years of price increases with no need to pay those funds to the IRS. I need a personal lobbyist.
2187 2018-01-23 04:12:45 I thought we buried the food vs fuel debate years ago when we were only dealing with corn. Now activists and oil shills want to argue about cellulosic feed stocks? Lol

2261 2018-01-23 03:25:27 Stocks are tangible assets. They represent a portion of a company. Their value is in the potential value of that portion of a dividend, this is their fundamental value. Stocks valued higher than their dividend value are speculating on an increase in that potential dividend.

2275 2018-01-23 03:21:53 Those mutual funds are stocks that the managers put in a bundle. You can either have a financial planner manage them or you can do it yourself. I suggest you look at Fidelity website. It will explain what I have been saying.

2313 2018-01-23 02:54:48 Comical when analysts say stocks can stay overbought for years after they have.

2314 2018-01-23 02:53:58 First of all, watching the Dow means nothing. Find out what stocks are in your 401k. You can move stocks around at any time. Watch the stocks in your 401k not the DOW.

2317 2018-01-23 02:52:47 All PSU Banks are below 2011 level. All Pharma stocks are much below 2014 level. Most midcaps are much below 2008 level. Still market is in Euphoric stage. Real estate in most places is 10 times higher than 2008. But that is very cheap?

b. Capital stocks & overseas markets, could hold value for the equity inclined, w/ bonds an absolute no-no. Earnings are faster outside the US

2324 2018-01-23 02:48:57 The three-month #tin price hit a fresh 2018 high at $20,800 per tonne during yesterdays closing – the highest since October 13, 2017.  #LME tin stocks are down over 11% so far this year, including a drop of 5% last week, and remain at record low levels of just 1,960 tonnes.
2325 2018-01-23 02:48:54 All value associated with stocks and currencies (intangible assets) is simply a representation of their speculative values as shelling points. They’re symbols, not objects. Speculation is simply future utility / supply / demand.

2339 2018-01-23 02:42:27 Some assets like stocks are fundamentally priced and pure cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are speculatively priced. Speculation in the former may lead to bubbles, while speculation in the latter leads to. . . prices.

2377 2018-01-23 02:19:03 So, we should buy and trade you like stocks or property instead of treating you as a human being?
2378 2018-01-23 02:19:02 Yes and no. Transfer agents (banks usually) hold and issue various companies’ stocks and offer direct investments, and dividend reinvestment. All for a hell of a lot cheaper than a broker. better for long term versus day trading
2379 2018-01-23 02:17:54 True, $SMG is probably the least risky way to invest in pot stocks (although the rewards will never be as large either of course)

2390 2018-01-23 02:09:19 #Stocks,#Indexes Market tops arrive pretty much unnoticed. Strong up days have become so frequent they are expected; expectation displaces surprise, to an extent mostly unnoticed. It's mass hysteria, but histrionic it is not. The psychological shift is subtle, unnoticed.
2391 2018-01-23 02:09:11 Emerging stocks look very iffy when we buy.
Then, rising prices slowly alter perception. 
When prices soar to all time highs, we rethink.
Consensus emerges just when questions beg asking.
Then, everybody tells us the stock is grt.
Naysayers go silent.
The silence always kills.

2425 2018-01-23 01:44:42 If you own a pub, and I'm the one that controls what stocks of beer you can order, how it's made and distributed, at what prices, how much your staff get paid, how much you can charge for it, who effectively is in control of the pub here? Does this make sense?
2426 2018-01-23 01:44:34 and why that its worth 15% of what it was centuries agi why because socialist wconomic theory was tested. A true capitalist society lacks regulation on the market it alows for growth. But if dollers are bad for you ill use pounds its vakue variates based on stocks and trade

2433 2018-01-23 01:35:07 It actually seems pretty intuitive that momentum would cause self reinforcing feedback loops because of the psychology of the herd and keep pushing stocks in the same direction. I guess it's just like value investing it either clicks right away or not.

2437 2018-01-23 01:34:08 Absolutely. Im not a trader. Im a valuation guy, Most of the stocks people mention on twitter that are CSE based, give me a heart attack when I rip open the financials...
2438 2018-01-23 01:33:19 @joe_palazzolo or the lowest Sfrican American unemployment in HISTORY! Or the surge in stocks. Or drop in taxes
2439 2018-01-23 01:32:11 I agree with $SX not knowing this was coming.The thing that bothers me is the other stocks that were hit along side $SX.Everything that has @sheldonstash touch was hit.The evidence is readily available.Start dropping charts to compare.@NotTheseDroids Whats the value in 2-3 months
2440 2018-01-23 01:32:06 Not to mention gun control! What happened to the discussions about regulating bump stocks? Conveniently forgotten. But I know, we don’t want to politicize what happened in Las Vegas, or TX. Sad!
2441 2018-01-23 01:31:24 Booming economy, lowest unemployment rate since 2000, Stocks are at an all-time high, food stamp usage lowest it's been since 2010, Black unemployment lowest it's been in 17 years... Carry on disapproving, or you could always choose to educate yourself 
2442 2018-01-23 01:30:02 Wait. Did stocks rise because of shutdown or because shutdown ended? See how crazy this way of thinking is?

2457 2018-01-23 01:23:31 @EdKrassen I was wondering as an investment expert, is it advisable to buy marijuana stocks?
2458 2018-01-23 01:22:33 stocks traded today.Keeping it safe instead of going in red

2459 2018-01-23 01:21:39 The lesser your holding period and more the number of stocks you own,  you need to come out with new ideas almost every other month. Difficult  to get good ideas with such a frequency. Better to hold fewer  companies for long term.
2460 2018-01-23 01:21:34 Hmmm remember when Kidd got the job in Milwaukee behind Larry Drew’s back?  Let’s not play dumb here people.
2461 2018-01-23 01:21:32 Stocks do not equate to wealth for the average person. You are an ingratiating, moronic, little man who will be voted out.
2462 2018-01-23 01:20:42 Don’t recall Larry Drew doing this when Kidd stole his job

2475 2018-01-23 01:12:44 Guilty!! Crypto trading is a whole diff world than penny stocks. 24/7 trading and not knowing how bad Asia can screw things up while you're sleeping..FOMO buying/selling...watching 15 and 5 min charts rather than 2/4hour..and not knowing if BTC goes down..everything bleeds out

2483 2018-01-23 01:05:40 @stocks_rachel Hi Rachel, I would like to invite you to a rountable event in Sydney on the 22nd Feb. What would be the best way to send you an invitation? Thank you
2484 2018-01-23 01:05:35 50% off Lisa Buckridge fashion and home accessories. Offer available while stocks last. Supersedes other offers. Offer starts 00:00 26th December 2017 and ends 23:59 31st January 2018.
2485 2018-01-23 01:05:33 Given the YTD move in some of these tech stocks, let alone their moves since last ern print, combined with their current implied ern move, hard not to want to be long the juice in 99% of them...
2486 2018-01-23 01:05:07 How did that work out for ya?
2487 2018-01-23 01:04:59 Rickey Henderson......there isn’t a bat flip if there isn’t a Rickey being Rickey!
2488 2018-01-23 01:04:02 I recommend looking into the “SPY” index fund. It’s composed of most of the large S&P 500 companies like Amazon, Apple, etc. It’s much more stable than singular stocks and will give you time to learn more about investing while already having some money “safety” invested.
2489 2018-01-23 01:03:55 Fact of specs: Most of th specs R moved by big players & their mates (who again are big players). They pump the stock they like with/without news & thn dump @ certain price. Hence, we see some stocks pumped hard while few quality stocks are still at the floor
= Follow Big Players
2490 2018-01-23 01:03:46 Yeah. It has been hard to short this market.
But doesn’t mean you can only make money if long and deep pockets.

That depends what underlyings you’re trading, what products you’re trading (options, futures, stocks, etc) and what strategies you’re implementing with the products.
2491 2018-01-23 01:02:24 Lately nothing makes me happier than when people hit me up to talk stocks 
2492 2018-01-23 01:02:01 Tax cuts provide no long term relief. Deregulations may stimulate economy but won't have the impact of Obama admin. Stocks have also steadily risen in recent years. FAR more jobs created under Obama's term. Countries are making motions to ban Trump so no respect there. #FakeNews
2493 2018-01-23 01:01:03 Put her in the stocks.  Put them all in the stocks so we can throw rotten veg and fish at them.
2494 2018-01-23 01:01:02 @OutFrontCNN You didn't interview others who are benefiting. Further you don't have to own stocks to benefit from the stock market. Retirement funds invest. All the number belong to Trump. You analyst said everything would plummet including Cuban. JOBS are a big thing.
2495 2018-01-23 00:59:55 Hate when ppl act like there intelligent but sit at home, no job, no stocks, no patents. Like put ur resume together
2496 2018-01-23 00:59:34 The trend is your friend. Buy strong stocks. Sell weak stocks as shown by price and volume behavior.
2497 2018-01-23 00:59:33 The key risk for investors in emerging-market stocks is not getting caught in a slump, but exiting the rally too early.

2505 2018-01-23 00:56:08 Question. How many of you actually own stocks in the market?
2506 2018-01-23 00:55:57 Ridiculous article.  As soon as he stated "shutdown even though there is one party rule" you HAD to know he is nuts.   And pity the fools who pulled their money out of stocks due to his call when Trump was elected.

2513 2018-01-23 00:50:39 I agree. You are looking at $14,400 that should be put right back into buying more dividend paying stocks.
2514 2018-01-23 00:50:27 Here you go:

Worried your wife left with your checkbook? No
Worried your stocks will lose value? No

Worried for the quality of your floppy ridge disks? No…(to be continued)
2515 2018-01-23 00:48:28 no problem :)  yeah, I'd rather load up on boring food stocks and consumer non-durables than try to reach for performance by playing with Jim Cramer's FANG stocks
2516 2018-01-23 00:47:51 To be fair president Obama had a lot to do with the economy for the first year. But yea the stock markets are popping records every week. Stocks are selling like a god church right now.
2517 2018-01-23 00:47:20 It’s gonna be funny if I become a millionaire with my marijuana stocks.  It’s still rising.

2520 2018-01-23 00:44:49 does't matter. should only play STRONG stocks now. no need to play aapl.
2521 2018-01-23 00:43:59 You don't have to continually looking for new stocks to buy. We're doing exceptionally well focused on stocks we know. ex $LABU $ROKU etc.
2522 2018-01-23 00:43:58 It’s never too late. Great companies will keep growing & becoming more valuable / expensive. Netflix increased about 15% today ($25~ per share). It’s earnings season so a lot of stocks will be reporting their Q4 earnings from 2017 & moving up/down because of it.
2523 2018-01-23 00:42:42 Betting huge chunks of portfolio in pre earnings spec stocks not for me

2551 2018-01-23 00:21:10 If you’re running a fund you want to look for stocks that can double in 3 years (24% annualized) and shorts that will lose 50% in 2 years (22% annualized)
#Netflix $NFLX sure fits the latter
2552 2018-01-23 00:20:41 My mom swears by it and our pharmacy stocks it. I’ve tried telling her it doesn’t (or barely) works (even with a citation), but to no avail. It’s nothing more than homeopathy with flower juice.
2553 2018-01-23 00:20:30 I honestly feel like you could throw a good trader 5 random stocks that clogged his account each day and he would come making money each day still because he would just simply sell the ones he felt uncomfortable with right away and play whatever is left
2554 2018-01-23 00:20:24 Stocks? I thought CNBC stood for Crypto News and Bitcoin Channel?!
2555 2018-01-23 00:19:21 Nothing wrong with doing that, or moving into some defensive stocks

2560 2018-01-23 00:09:49 Another reason I can't stand shitcoin mining. Currency exchange is not an investment. Go to a casino or buy stocks. Stop screwing over gaming on a bubble that won't exist in 20 years.

2568 2018-01-23 00:04:37 I honestly don't care how much the man made. All I care about are my tax returns and they're looking pretty dang good. Thanks again @realDonaldTrump . Oh and my stocks are also looking pretty dang good. P.S. Those things never happened with Obama, in fact just the opposite
