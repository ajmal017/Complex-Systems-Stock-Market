37 2018-11-06 22:22:44 Just purchased a bunch of hot commodities and ready to make some pixel dollars.
38 2018-11-06 22:22:09 Em tecnologia, ciência e patentes, ou seja, inovação, que é a verdadeira riqueza no séc. XXI, e não venda de commodities (baixo valor), como estes idiotas que cagam números aleatórios querem.
39 2018-11-06 22:19:25 1) Você não sabe porra nenhuma de Bitcoin. 2) Eu falo o que eu quiser. 3) Se você gosta de que o Brasil continue a ser o infinito país exportador de commodities (baixo valor) que é, e não um exportador de tecnologia, ciência e patentes (alto valor), fique com o Egito e a putada.
40 2018-11-06 22:14:56 Se recua pro Egito imagina quando a China ameaçar a importação de commodities.

É um frouxo mesmo.


41 2018-11-06 22:12:38 Just by calling a cycle a bubble it doesnt make it a bubble. Also you talk about commodities, EMs and Techs. In 2012! By 2015 you would have been fired in a hedge fund, showing no results. Also its, imho an oversimplification of whats happening now. Just my view

45 2018-11-06 21:55:03 Consider reading the US Senate Permanent Subcmte on Investigations 2014 report into bank involvement in physical commodities. Metals business is messy.
46 2018-11-06 21:54:52 Yes but as long as those capitalists markets exist they will be forced to produce commodities at the socially necessary labor time. This means that not only will they have to work like capitalists but they'll have to exploit  natural resources at the same rate
47 2018-11-06 21:54:37 O minério é comprado a preço de mercado como Commodities. Óbvio que quando retorna manufaturado, industrializado, o valor é muito maior. Não seria esta a lógica?
48 2018-11-06 21:44:22 Abortion and industry should never be in the same phrase. These are babies not commodities.
49 2018-11-06 21:34:17 Yo Beto we haven’t been in trade wars in a long time. And our commodity prices have stayed the same. Since the 80’s don’t fight against the American farmer. At least trump understands that China turkey and many other countries get better prices for shittier quality commodities
50 2018-11-06 21:32:38 High $ add negative sentiment to at commodities? Long term bear market set up?
51 2018-11-06 21:24:27 Tenemos commodities estrategicos, aquellos relacionado al morfi. Eso nos hace problematicos. Por eso creo nos tienen adentro. Sino ya hubieramos 'siamo fuori de la copa' mucho tiempo atras.
52 2018-11-06 21:23:43 that means this month you can be paid 50k or    20k depending on the demand for labour and inflatory commodities such as export products (petrol), electricity etc...
53 2018-11-06 21:20:38 Los procesos de selección en las temporales, sí así se le puede llamar, son más un check list.  de requisitos, es como ser "commodities" - que confianza puede dar un reclutador que ni contacto visual me da, muy frustrante la situación.
54 2018-11-06 21:16:46 Um professor de economia dizia como o melhor para o Brasil era investir em commodities e em infra para escoar a produção, dado o perfil do país e a extensão de terras. Aí vem presidente BoiNoRabo cagar as relações comerciais com 4 grandes parceiros do Brasil.
55 2018-11-06 21:12:45 No you don't. Money emerges inside prisons, it doesn't need to be issued by the state. People notice certain commodities or goods are more universally desired, so they exchange goods or services for them with the understanding they'll be able to trade them in the future.
56 2018-11-06 21:12:12 As exportações brasileira para o mundo árabe (principalmente de carne, commodities agrícolas e minerais) são infinitamente maiores do que para Israel. Junto com a China, são os nossos maiores parceiros comerciais.

62 2018-11-06 21:05:04 Very positive development if it comes off, and leveraging success of scrap — one of the most successful commodities derivatives launches of recent years. Better than hedging steel exposure via iron ore too, liquidity allowing
63 2018-11-06 21:02:26 Quran 8:67- It is not for a prophet to have captives [of war] until he inflicts a massacre [upon Allah 's enemies] in the land. Some Muslims desire the commodities of this world, but Allah desires [for you] the Hereafter. And Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise.
64 2018-11-06 21:00:01 #Gold and #silver, like other #commodities, have an intrinsic value, which is not arbitrary, but is dependent on their scarcity.
65 2018-11-06 20:59:13 Price of fuel and basic commodities are shooting up. Definitely not a good luck. #Gambia
66 2018-11-06 20:49:17 It's going to look better until there's hike in the price of commodities and services. Then we'll be just back to where we were.  30k will have the same value as 18k soon. NLC should fight for price control instead.
67 2018-11-06 20:38:08 Creo que NK y CFK con los más altos valores de commodities y un colchón cambiario que les dejó Duhalde, no supieron aprovechar el escenario para desarrollar la economía.
Macri al revés, con la globalización en retracción, aplicó un modelo tipo años 90'. 
Ninguno leyó la realidad
68 2018-11-06 20:36:06 Un gobierno puede recibir una herencia complicada en un escenario favorable (NK en 2003 y CFK en 2007) o recibir una herencia complicada en un escenario de retracción, tasas altas en el mundo y caída de commodities (Macri 2015)
En una y otra situación, hay que leer la realidad

74 2018-11-06 20:05:18 Plot the BCOM index (overall commoditis) the overlay is better..Emerging are more related to industrials commodities (with 50% of demand from china). Oil is more influnced IMO from demand worlwide and from related supply problem.
75 2018-11-06 19:59:57 It’s not about the increase in the minimum wage but the prices of essential commodities and services that will increase in geometric progression.
76 2018-11-06 19:59:34 Spoofing is one of the best illustrations of the difference between the securities and commodities markets with respect to #law, #regulation, and regulatory authorities. Spoofing in the commodities market is so much easier to prosecute. #CFTC #SEC
77 2018-11-06 19:58:34 Also the line used by fans who don't want players paid. Same fans turn around and say it's not the coach's job to mold players into good citizens. You'd think those fans and the NCAA would at least pretend to care about the players other than as commodities.
78 2018-11-06 19:57:29 The president sits on all the revenue agencies in Nigeria. NNPC, Customs, jamb, FIRS, etc and yet it's the senators that is your headache. The senators made 1$=360, made price of essential commodities high and made 13 million youth lost their jobs in just 3 years plus abi?
79 2018-11-06 19:47:24 Exactly. And we forget that these two commodities were not always part of our staples. There is a lot to be said for preferring the indigenous staples that you mention.
80 2018-11-06 19:43:49 This President thing is just an outing for you ? A meet and greet for five years ? Where are the basic commodities for the people ?..... I repeat !

92 2018-11-06 19:17:34 ok you have a guild... so what? can you construct/capture assets and produce commodities that you can sell? nope all you can hope to do is to be the servant of a faction. @EliteDangerous needs a cycle of manufacture. logistics,production, and security.
93 2018-11-06 19:15:34 Its a good thing.Guinea economy is like Zimbabwe both heavily rely on commodities.They have oil and diamond too.Its good to compare notes

95 2018-11-06 19:05:32 Increasing minimum wage should not be a priority now. We should force govt to provide good health care, reduce the prices of food commodities, standard and quality education that will be free up to university level.
96 2018-11-06 18:53:26 Yeah. 
Are they supposed to strike for minimum wage increase or fight for decrease of commodities
97 2018-11-06 18:49:20 Correct.
We all know that.
If your husband would abandon a woman because of missing out on a few days of sex, then I believe she chose someone who doesn't deserve her.

98 2018-11-06 18:46:58 People still don't realise that increase in wages will bring about a potential increase in d prices of commodities? OK.

103 2018-11-06 18:32:48 Not only that, but the largest contributor to price increase for commodities and services is not due to changes in labor cost. If most places changed their prices it would by a very small amount or else they are just punishing the consumer and laborer in a decimation-esque scheme

107 2018-11-06 18:25:29 The current recruitment process is fantastic at avoiding A players at all costs and treating people as commodities.
108 2018-11-06 18:22:22 Contracts often used to trade commodities like oil gold etc. You would have probably bought all the coffee in the world and forced Starbucks to open in Pakistan just to release supply
109 2018-11-06 18:22:05 They are forced because they don't have a choice once they are bred into that environment.  According to you, the "flunkies" (the ones that don't meet your standards) may possibly get to go live in a home.  They are nothing more than commodities in your racing world.
110 2018-11-06 18:18:26 So Nigerians will pay more tax then they were paying because of the increase in minimum wage. So what are we celebrating when there will be increase in commodities?
111 2018-11-06 18:15:25 Com todo o respeito ao Bredda, discordo. Aumento dos juros vai estourar as bolhas de crédito, detonar demanda por bens de capital e por conseguinte commodities, e possivelmente falir países. 
Isso fora o gasto com juros pelo gov EUA.
112 2018-11-06 18:10:21 Did you know: The labour gap in 2014 for horticulture commodities was 35,700 and is expected to increase to 46,500 by 2025. #FallHarvest #cdnpoli #cdnag
113 2018-11-06 18:06:06 In 2015 they were acquired by a pan-European asset management org which claims to have investment funds of £200m for the UK alone and a European turnover of €3.5bn. No doubt our care sector is at crisis point but care, and those who need it, are not commodities to be traded
114 2018-11-06 18:00:24 Palace says inflation staying at 6.7% in October
Presl. Spokesperson Salvador Panelo said the fact that the inflation stayed at 6.7 percent should be a good news. Panelo stressed the October inflation reflects the government’s efforts to tame the soaring prices of commodities.

117 2018-11-06 17:50:41 i can't decide if cryptocurrencies have reached an equilibrium of value where they're actually useful as currencies, if they're functionally over with and are winding down, or if they're just in an investing lull and treating them like commodities is going to start up again soon.
118 2018-11-06 17:42:01 I also want to urge u regarding the issue of the increments in the minimum wage....its a fantastic idea and you've done it.... But then again I will urge u to consider price control,else the price of the food stuff and other commodities will escalate and the poor man will suffer.
119 2018-11-06 17:37:57 Turkey can’t control prices - commodities are a global market - it’s bonkers to ask suppliers to sell at a loss
120 2018-11-06 17:34:37 para com essa merda de virar venezuela, é impossível, brasil é uma das maiores economias do mundo, tem variabilidade em commodities, tem equilíbrio nos 3 poderes, e tem uma população ativa, há protocolos e uma constituição plenamente respeitada, para com essa merda sério...
121 2018-11-06 17:30:15 Do we really not have anyone worth taking a look at in the forward position besides Wood? We know what he can do. Same at GK - no one other than Guzan? These are friendlies, why waste them looking at known commodities like them.

125 2018-11-06 17:16:54 Animals are easy commodities to get rid of once they don't fit. And when things are tight they are always first. In no circumstance if someone's situation changes would someone say 'well we can have the kids adopted'.
126 2018-11-06 17:00:25 Not sure, though desalination is getting cheaper on its own. Seawater extraction is interesting: it effectively provides a "cap" on prices for a lot of commodities. Lithium and especially uranium might both be practical to extract.
127 2018-11-06 16:58:12 Aye, more than this the fact that the work of dead artists appreciates makes all artefactual art investment commodities.
128 2018-11-06 16:57:49 Today smells of deflation on commodities market
129 2018-11-06 16:57:11 The economic problems in US which culminated in Trump's election have been caused by #Corporatism where local, state, & the federal governments have become tools of corporations & workers disposable commodities, all driven by financial markets promoted by @FT, London, #WallStreet
130 2018-11-06 16:50:22 Due to the sensitive nature and high regulation of such commodities (alcohol and dairy products), manufacturing at small scale will make quality control and standardisation a nightmare thus rise of substandard goods. And you are forgetting most of those companies are Kenya owned
131 2018-11-06 16:49:20 As it is, the country is broke, which means federal allocations to states will continue to shrink. At 18k, states have failed to match up and pay salaries. 30k means more money for workers, prices of commodities will spike, salaries will be owed, and everyone will suffer it.

139 2018-11-06 16:22:34 These market raids on commodities are becoming predictable and a sign of desperation. Too obvious there is something behind driving these things up towards US open and then selling them off. Won't last long, smart money getting ready for the markup next. Still accumulation.
140 2018-11-06 16:15:07 "Sabbath is the cessation of widely shared practices of acquisitiveness.

150 2018-11-06 15:36:34 Idols are fan commodities and are sold to fans as such that's why they don't date, don't have asay in anything, etc am speaking of the kpop world as it is, you are viewing it in a future tense or whatever sense. That's not the reality. They aren't artists at all.
151 2018-11-06 15:29:07 okay i get it. up until this point, you view them as FAN COMMODITIES, not ARTISTS, being an artist equate to not having restrictions and accusing them of not speaking of how they feel?! that speaks a lot. i see why u need to leave. we dont need your twisted mindset either. leave.
152 2018-11-06 15:26:40 I seriously doubt that I have anything in common with right wing anythings. Labels are for commodities not people.
153 2018-11-06 15:23:14 They do need to give the fans what they deserve cause they are marketed as fan commodities not artists, when they start making their own decisions, speaking on what they feel and being their own people without restrictions and control then they will become artists, they are idols

155 2018-11-06 15:17:06 Whats irritating is that he oversimplifies a very real problem. Yes we have high unemployment and yes a lot of skilled Saudis are struggling. But we also have Saudis themselves hiring “cheap labor”, fake Saudization, villages lacking the city’s commodities, and more.

159 2018-11-06 15:06:51 The flaw is thinking that healthcare behaves like other commodities, where if the price is too high consumers would stop buying or find a substitute.

Steak is too expensive= buy chicken

161 2018-11-06 15:06:00 I mean transactions that take place outside of the US. Don’t most of them that involve commodities use the US dollar? And isn’t that the main reason the US currency maintains its value
162 2018-11-06 14:57:12 What do the leaders of the world banks expect. The higher standard of living country's can't compete with lower standard country's labor or commodities. when these become more equal then maybe trade tensions will become less. I have always wondered, who owns the world bank?
163 2018-11-06 14:54:30 But doesn’t the dollars value rely on foreign countries buying commodities using the dollar? So what would domestic resources have to do with it.

184 2018-11-06 13:44:56 This is totally misleading. The tariffs do not hurt farmers. Farm commodities don’t just magically increase or decrease. There’s only so much soybeans in the world.

233 2018-11-06 09:11:53 Of course China senses Brexit Britain opportunities. It'll be the biggest fire sale in history. You'll find China is in a long term battle for domination by acquistions of land, companies and commodities on nearly every continent. Britain, alone, will be ripe for the picking.

236 2018-11-06 08:56:45 What I think should be paramount now is the reduction of commodities in the market, not increase in pay.. Last last, it's those market people that will enjoy the minimum wage. #MyTake
237 2018-11-06 08:48:29 Nigerians shouting for increase in minimum wage, that's not a solution people, that's just adding problems. I assure you the moment it goes up, transport fares will, commodities will, taxes everything will go up!! That's how economics work. We need to look at the big picture here
238 2018-11-06 08:48:12 Commodities: Gold lost 0.09pc to $1,231.39 and Brent gained 0.47pc to $73.17
239 2018-11-06 08:42:25 Firstly, there can be never be "problem with increased pay" What inflation are you talking about? If anything, salary is finally catching up with sky rocket prices of commodities. Let's congratulate Nigerian workers
240 2018-11-06 08:41:10 Responses are a reflection of the prevailing confusion.Officially 1:1 & yet most prices are beyond 100% now, rather than frequent fee reviews use of an official currency is  more manageable.Just like ministers charging in US$ on selected commodities, pvt enterprise is the key wrd
241 2018-11-06 08:40:37 Yes but I really can’t accept animals as commodities as I see them as beings with intrinsic value over and above any value/price we out on them. As you can probably guess, I am a vegan.
242 2018-11-06 08:38:04 I think there is a plan to establish a Kenya commodities exchange by the ministry of trade...this will really help farmers...
243 2018-11-06 08:37:09 I think we are stuck to the summer to be honest.  Fullbacks who can defend are rare commodities. Tierney might be able to cut it, but he plays for Celtic who rarely defend so who knows!  Meunier might be a good option at right back to rotate with Aurier.  He is defensive minded
244 2018-11-06 08:36:54 ....in Nigeria prices of commodities take the LIFT while the wages takes the STAIRS..!!!!! a painful reality..
245 2018-11-06 08:36:18 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.

247 2018-11-06 08:25:01 The A’s poised to go on a magical decade run with their picks and trade commodities finally paying off. Will be the basis for Moneyball 2. And why would he leave now leave to a Giants team devoid of any talent. And old.
248 2018-11-06 08:11:09 Which kudos senator. He brought about this increment in salary with his unproductive policies that increased the prices of all commodities in the market. So how can 18k which is manageable before he came in suit the economic realities on the ground now. Please don’t celebrate him
249 2018-11-06 08:10:04 @upstox all your MCX charts are wrong.  Somehow non of the commodities are showing yesterday's chart. All are wrong. Check & update
250 2018-11-06 08:06:02 I look forward to a time in Nigeria where #NLC will not only strike  because of #increasement in #salary but strike because of increasement in price of #commodities in the market.
251 2018-11-06 08:05:26 we are at the forefront of the #No_To_Fake products as we want quality commodities in africa.
252 2018-11-06 08:03:42 COMMODITIES ROUND-UP : METALS AND OIL #S_FX #Forex2018 November 06, 2018 at 08:03AM #ForexNovember
253 2018-11-06 07:52:15 #oil Prices could spike to $90 or $100/bbl due to potential for supply disruptions. Ed Morse, Citigroup’s head of commodities research, tells Bloomberg TV.
254 2018-11-06 07:46:08 As he vowed to improve south African citizens' life . Why unemployment rate, petrol price and other economic commodities increase further? While majority of our country's compatriots are jobless.
255 2018-11-06 07:42:34 When I did my NYSC,I earned N1,900,that money purchased more goods than the N19,800 they currently earn. 

Therefore,increase in salary is not the issue but NLC insisting that FG formulate policies that will make the naira stronger, drive down inflation & make commodities cheaper
256 2018-11-06 07:33:16 Leasing silo space is not the same thing as policy change where NCPB (read government) ceases to trade commodities on its own account.
257 2018-11-06 07:21:31 From my own perspective there won't be significant increase in prices of commodities, because the volumes sold currently is quite low, so commodity sellers will be praying  for an increase in volume sold than an increase in price.
258 2018-11-06 07:14:08 I'm looking for Black Friday specials on stocks, bonds, commodities and real estate. Which store can I visit? 
259 2018-11-06 07:05:04 3215: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
260 2018-11-06 07:02:56 How is that going to help the common man in Kenya? Bwana weta, I was expecting you to tell us how to reduce the prices of basic commodities.
261 2018-11-06 06:53:57 EMX launches Q1 next year we'll have equities, fx, commodities, and crypto futures

You'll be able to use $btc or $eth as collateral
262 2018-11-06 06:42:44 Listen to yourself...#30k is a go...what can that afford when the prices of commodities increased drastically since 3yrs...
263 2018-11-06 06:40:33 Commodities were rangebound overnight amid a stable greenback and mixed risk tone in which $WTI #crude futures languished below the US$ 63/bbl
264 2018-11-06 06:35:00 The most important organ in the body as far as the stock market is concerned is the guts, not the head. Anyone can acquire the know-how for analyzing stocks.

265 2018-11-06 06:20:16 So what are the prices of those commodities and the naira value at present in APC's government? Tell us.
266 2018-11-06 06:18:21 The second largest wine company in the world is scaling back wine to focus on pot. They sell commodities of any stripe constantly moving from milked out brand to milked out brand.
267 2018-11-06 06:01:59 #StrictlyNaija
Now that FG has agreed 30K Minimum Wage, I pray that Commodities in the should remain as they were 'cus Pepper Sellers may increase their Minimum Sales as well and Inflation may Burst!!!
#Kollafrika #TalkWordAfrica
268 2018-11-06 06:00:30 For u chaddilees, they are merely destroyable commodities.
269 2018-11-06 05:58:36 Flawed reasoning aside, those animals are reluctantly put down because too many people treat animals as disposable commodities. Blame a society that treats the welfare of animals with flagrant disregard.
270 2018-11-06 05:54:07 For Prelichaddis and their cohorts Shri Ram and Sabarimala are merely exploitable commodities.
271 2018-11-06 05:50:43 I wanted Gattuso gone a month ago, but we seem to have improved within the last month, keeping clean sheet and 4 wins in a row (both were very scarce commodities a month back). So I don’t see Gattuso leaving (on current form)
272 2018-11-06 05:42:50 Being part of ag twitter and yee haw twitter is honestly so strange bc on one tweet they’re arguing like adults about commodities or veganism and on another somebody is saying somebody isn’t cowboy enough cuz they sell their nudes or some shit.
273 2018-11-06 05:42:48 Note: NSE,BSE,F&O and Currency Market will remain close on 8th Nov,2018 on account of Diwali-Balipratipada. 
Commodities Market will remain open at 5:00 P.M to 11:55 P.M
274 2018-11-06 05:28:56 Good idea having a commodities exchange and derivatives generally but fiscal operations in Kenya distort asset prices
275 2018-11-06 05:20:21 Can you tell us value of Commodities, prices of Oil,(petrol,diesel/kero) & Dollar then and now, before you make your conclusion
276 2018-11-06 05:19:29 But the fuel price is still the same for now ka
Unless you speaking from a point where it includes buying basic commodities to look after themselves
277 2018-11-06 05:06:24 It’s not moral to use animals to make profit from. Theyre not slaves, neither commodities but sentient beings.
278 2018-11-06 05:05:01 No we need zoos bc 1st world has impoverished the 3rd world with debt & civil wars for commodities like diamonds & gold have driven animals away. The world has taken too long to ban all ivory & China still won't. The demand for herbal remedies will destroy elephants & rhino.
279 2018-11-06 05:00:02 Commodities: Palladium -8.36%, Canola +1.41%
280 2018-11-06 04:51:59 If you don't love me then dont lie to me I'm getting sick of the commodities
281 2018-11-06 04:46:43 Tell them I’m available although I have none of the commodities they want
282 2018-11-06 04:41:53 Chinese currency crisis, trump trade war continues, rates continue to rise rapidly, dollar becomes even stronger, emerging markets collapse, continued debt problems in EU Asia and South America, commodities sky rocket. #2019
283 2018-11-06 04:27:03 O Brasil tem de se preocupar em fazer negócios com todo o mundo sem o viés ideológico, assim como o presidente eleito disse, e não entrar no meio do conflito semita. O Brasil sobrevive de commodities, se o mundo árabe se virar contra o Brasil, será ruim para o comércio exterior.
284 2018-11-06 04:17:58 Aur more than master of faith.. think what you have done for people of this country.. betrayed then.. prices petrol Gas USD essential commodities have shooted up.. black money did not come back.. demonstration hit the ordinary people. Pollution in delhi unaddressed.. sad to see.

Brasil ñ é EUA,nossa economia é baseada em commodities,se reduzir compradores por ideologia,o preço cai e o país quebra
286 2018-11-06 03:59:38 The increase of fuel  led to the increase of all basic commodities even taxi  fares and a number of other services. Are all those coming down as well. Guys in 2019 kuzazoba lit. Kosha mabhokisi kusale amaphepha.

290 2018-11-06 03:28:36 ...and then completely razing the social and economic ground those newly minted hyper-individual neo-liberal subjects stand on, so they can't even properly narcotize themselves with commodities against the soul crushing alienation this causes.
291 2018-11-06 03:26:38 Couldn't agree more. And I sympathize with Joe calling Brooks bullshit.  I agree that it's bullshit, but in the other direction. He presents growing alienation as a self-driving fact, not the result of capital's vacuuming up and repackaging community as series of commodities...

293 2018-11-06 03:00:24 While we yearn for that, most of us know that the political class (atleast a majority) will not see that happen. It is way overdue to have the commodities exchange.

295 2018-11-06 02:42:29 E é justamente o oposto, todos eles dependem especialmente dos preços baixíssimos, que vendemos a eles, nossas commodities como carne e grãos, além de recursos minerais, em tese a dependência dos bens de escassez é claramente deles.

298 2018-11-06 02:26:38 People's circumstances became commodities
299 2018-11-06 02:21:34 This needs to be read by everyone.  And then people need to start seriously thinking about how to shut this down.  Not just them but the entire approach if we want to be more than a brainless bunch of commodities bought and sold by these foul creatures.
300 2018-11-06 02:17:59 I will not argue with people that know their stuff , 
2 question 
If things are peachy in soy market why is that commodity at 10 yr time low
And is high soy crushing not do to low commodities thus making being it à no brainer  why soymeal sales are good
301 2018-11-06 02:14:42 When my mom told me her story girl I couldn’t stop crying. The things she went through just to give me so many opportunities and commodities. I can’t thank my parents enough.
302 2018-11-06 02:13:08 @Sudhirntv counterfeit commodities are on the rise. Better do due diligence when purchasing on some online platforms.

It's bad bad sauce.
307 2018-11-06 01:57:53 Vergonha. Jogaram fora duas gerações e não construiram nada. No periodo do governo do PT, 2002 a 2018, a Koreia saiu de $10 mil para $40 mil de renda per capta, sem o ciclo de commodities. E voces o que fizeram?? Roubaram o orgulho e endividaram o povo. Criaram uma cleptocracia.
308 2018-11-06 01:57:51 That’s a huge problem with commodity ag, I’m blessed in that I dont produce commodities but look for and fill niche markets.  Ppl are willing to pay more for non gmo, grass finished, organic.... but not every producer wants to (nor could they) try and fill those markets

314 2018-11-06 01:35:48 Shall I go on? Government has its place but it needs to be focused on what its original intention was: Homeland security, judicial protection of the consitution, law enforcement and some public commodities such as roads and transportation.

317 2018-11-06 01:11:55 I wanna see this corporate retard @brianjames defend @WWE against the ridiculousness that took place at #MurderMania aka #CrownJewel this past Friday. How does Strowman Job like that? Is there no sense of commodities in WWE? Terrible. Smoke some weed and be creative!
318 2018-11-06 01:02:57 A human right is something you have by nature of being, housing is not one of those, neither is healthcare, these are commodities, important ones, but not human rights. They are dependent on other people doing things for you. You can’t demand that.

320 2018-11-06 00:51:00 I’m only like 50% convinced that we even make a first round pick. Snead and McVay obviously value proven commodities much more.
321 2018-11-06 00:50:36 If they didn't treat people like commodities with zero rights, perhaps they could keep people. 

Of course, I'm bias. T-minus 8 months and 30 days until separation.
322 2018-11-06 00:50:34 It means the arms are almost the only product Russia can produce and export and it doesn't exceed the Polish furniture export. The rest of Russian export consists of the raw commodities. It's nothing much to show off for the Russian authorities, is it?
