2067/8 is basically governed globally by corporate greed. But instead of going full distopic, they went "Gilded cage": consumers still need to buy products for economy to work - and they're willing to accept *a lot* as long as commodities are assured.

44 2018-11-05 21:23:30 O mundo árabe são um dos maiores importadores de carne do Brasil. O insulto a eles com a transferência da embaixada para Jerusalém resultará em represálias imensuráveis. Vale salientar que o país vive da exportação de commodities.
45 2018-11-05 21:22:51 If NLC embark on this proposed strike, traders would hike the price of commodities. If fortunately the strike yields positive results for workers, please note that price of goods in the market won't come back to present values. 
This is Nigeria where we disobey law of gravity.
46 2018-11-05 21:11:54 O problema é que Bolso disse que faria comércio sem viés ideológico, e já está prematuramente azedando relações comerciais com importantes parceiros. Somos um país que exporta commodities em sua maioria. Só exportamos manufaturados para países do Mercosul.

48 2018-11-05 21:07:39 Não duvido nada que ate o fim do mandato do Bolsonaro, deixaremos de ser um país que só vive commodities, iremos de fato nos industrializar e começar a manufaturar a maior parte do que consumimos. DA-LHE CAPITÃO.

52 2018-11-05 20:41:12 Brazilian economy is reliant on inefficient internal market, not with commodities. One could argue that Chile, a country that's REALLY reliant on commodities, does a better job with the economy than Brazil.

69 2018-11-05 19:47:22 Healthcare is a commodity. Just like we don't want government owning the means of production in other commodities, it has no business running healthcare.

Yes, socialized medicine results in worse outcomes for the citizens of the nations that force it on them.
70 2018-11-05 19:47:22  current policies are driving down equity markets and commodities are rotting on the vine thanks to an escalating trade war. Healthcare is a right and it will become so. Ain’t a damn thing conservatives can do to stop it.
71 2018-11-05 19:41:47 That's how @Conservatives see us - person non grata commodities
72 2018-11-05 19:39:16 It's not an excuse... it can be controlled, probably from the wholesale end or by market unions setting ceiling price on some important commodities. I'm fully in support of increasing it
73 2018-11-05 19:38:55 The government can regulate the price of commodities be it produced or imported. We have the Consumer Protection Council that monitors the quality of services being rendered by marketers. We have many of such entities but this is Nigeria.

91 2018-11-05 18:56:21 Cause capitalism. More people want to live here -- more money chasing fewer assets equals an increase in the price of commodities. That's how it works. It's not politicians' responsibilities to build more homes, especially when we don't want increased population density.

93 2018-11-05 18:54:00 O inconsequente racista vai acabar afugentando investimentos que são a base do PIB brasileiro. As commodities representam mais da metade da geração de riqueza e 40% disso é exportado para a China. Vai acabar estraçalhando a economia e o lesado será você, que nada sabia disso.

96 2018-11-05 18:50:13 Absolutely agree with those. But Brazil are not just oranges and sugarcane. I’m thinking in a bigger picture. Technology, defense, and I’m sure there’s some other commodities that Brazil can do better like coffee, soy and others
97 2018-11-05 18:47:16 US: Whether the cryptocurrencies are commodities, the anti-fraud and manipulation provisions of principal law dealing with commodities come into play, and that depends on the jurisdiction.
98 2018-11-05 18:46:31 Besides that, Brazil competes with American producers on commodities. Trump is not going to open their markets for Brazilian orange just to lose Florida. Even sugarcane has strong opposition in Iowa, Florida and Minnesota.

100 2018-11-05 18:45:11 In the United States, more organizations are accepting cryptocurrencies as legal tender, and as their popularity continues to grow, the authorities must establish its legal status and characterize them: are they securities, money, commodities, or swaps/futures.

116 2018-11-05 18:11:46 Bet you a dollar that before Trump launched his trade war, Don Jr. and Eric shorted futures for soy beans and other commodities that China has been buying, in anticipation of China retaliating. Trump isn't suffering, and neither will his children. #MAGASuckers

121 2018-11-05 17:50:00 The WRS Bill has actually been accelerated through Parliament because it already underwent the full process in @Senate_KE and is now well progressed in @NAssemblyKE. It is the precursor of the commodities exchange we badly need
122 2018-11-05 17:40:53 It’d be like letting an ape adopt a human baby and then saying ‘oh look how cute’. It’s not really fair on the tigers is it? They should be in their natural environment and with other tigers. Not being kept as commodities because it’s entertaining or ‘cute’ to us.
123 2018-11-05 17:36:49 BINGO. they and #Mexico, etc. can purchase farm commodities from Brazil, etc. Mexico already cut their purchase of U.S. grain by 15%

127 2018-11-05 17:21:03 Just did the math and, since tampons are taxed as commodities in Utah, it is actually cheaper to buy tampons at $.25 each from the office vending machine than from the grocery store.

131 2018-11-05 17:10:35 Its sad that countries like Ethiopia are already doing commodities exchange. As a farmer i should be in a position to get into a 9 months commodities future having known the cost of my inputs. Unfortunately we cant allow all these because it will seal corruption holes.

133 2018-11-05 17:03:33 The other side of the s&d table. 
Yes, the U.S. continues to ramp up prod. in a number of commodities. 
Producing is what we are good at.
The issue then becomes what happens to increased production when demand is threatened. 
Which goes back to the pic of the pile of soybeans.

142 2018-11-05 16:07:45 Wrong! That’s a false device; it only calculates DIRECT costs; it fails to add INDIRECT costs, such as higher commodities prices resulting from higher transportation fuel costs, higher tractor fuel costs, higher energy prices for food preparation, etc. Overall impact much greater
143 2018-11-05 16:05:00 Money is a commodity... not a useless token only good for exchanging;... It differs from other commodities in being demanded mainly as a medium of exchange. - Murray Rothbard
144 2018-11-05 16:04:07 So commodities are no longer enough to pay debts to China.
145 2018-11-05 16:02:55 It's a question ive always wondered. 

I'm sure i know a guy who knows a guy who could find a guy who deals in that stuff. But i grew up in a lower middle class area of metro Detroit, where guns and self defense are presented as necessities, not commodities.  BUT...
146 2018-11-05 16:00:18 Qual o problema de vocês?

Seis tão ligados que a China é uma das maiores se não a maior importadora de commodities brasileiras né? Seis conseguem pensad fora da caixinha pra analisar que qualquer "quebra de contrato" com a China prejudicaria o Brasil né?
147 2018-11-05 15:56:34 China is a great partner to trade with. All we need is a strategy to strike balance of trade. Develop strategies to export to China. Their large population translates to high demand for various commodities.
148 2018-11-05 15:55:30 A commodities exchange is the way to go if farmers are to reap from their produce. Let brokerage be formal not by cartels. Should be part of the food security pillar of the big 4.
149 2018-11-05 15:52:53 BUSINESS

150 2018-11-05 15:42:00 Also, the application options can be charged on Tuesday (or first) of the elections. The biggest punishment for the chase of commodities following the ceremony is "Thank you" equally!
151 2018-11-05 15:38:45 I like commodities when in a free market. I don't like politicians chasing Communist China's fake money to control the producers by the extension of controlling the opportunities for market participation.
152 2018-11-05 15:38:20 Your addiction to drugs is not nobler than any other addiction to commodities.
153 2018-11-05 15:38:12 Absolutely, I was floored you got such a candid answer too.  I hope you are able to get him talking even more after things start moving. He has so much knowledge of gold/commodities, and it looks like this will be our new home for crypto.I've been studying up on it too... ;)
154 2018-11-05 15:37:25 In the context of the px move, you'd see a swift supply response in any commodity.  I think we can both agree that pxs tend to overshoot both ways.  It's why commodities are cyclical.
155 2018-11-05 15:35:41 David Robinson from the IMF: "Countries dependence on commodities became more worrying when commodity prices collapsed". Should have been before. Of course they collapsed, that's what commodity prices do #AfricasRisingDebt
156 2018-11-05 15:34:20 La duda que tengo respecto a esto es que los paises exentos (especialmente China) abusen de esa medida para con empresas maletin para comprar toda la produccion Irani.  China es conocida por malas practicas con otros “commodities” (la miel por ejemplo).
157 2018-11-05 15:28:50 Whether women are commodities is not a debate we should have in the 21st century,  but one was recently exchanged for 500 cows and we've been celebrating it as a rich culture.  

"The man who brings the most cows gets my daughter". Feminists won't be angry unless they are paid?

160 2018-11-05 15:26:36 But isn't it those commodities that create the base foundation of creating that wealth in the first place? You wouldn't have a restaurant industry if not for the soft commodities of, food like wheat or corn or beef for example. Or the energy industry and all that stems from it?
161 2018-11-05 15:24:45 That's a great idea but is the commodities market in kenya ready to take shape? Will our farmers agree to the commodity futures?
162 2018-11-05 15:23:22 You are SO right! As long as animals are seen as commodities instead of as individuals, abuse is inevitable. 
163 2018-11-05 15:23:20 Yeah, they are incredibly prone to infection. Very curious what the new editing techniques can do for those under-bred commodities.
164 2018-11-05 15:21:15 Politicians chase commodities because then they can force people out of the wealth creation of capitalism into the trade management of mis-labelled "free" markets. @SaskParty
165 2018-11-05 15:20:38 Then you’re right back in the same situation, a bloated team salary that attendance can’t justify, so you sell of top commodities for prospects but alienate the fanbase and you repeat the cycle over again.

181 2018-11-05 14:30:07 1 thing I don't get,  Equities vs Commodities. Commodities look cheap on a historical basis. GSCI vs SP500 for example. Commodities always rally sharply as we go late in the business cycle & head into a recession. I see no evidence at the moment. Yet many call for a recession.

224 2018-11-05 11:11:45 Sounds about historically right to me.  Preserving their lives of privilege.  By making those people they considered as commodities, slaves.
225 2018-11-05 10:41:15 The only thing that generally outpaces inflation is equities. Bonds, commodities eg. Gold, real estate, etc stagger.

227 2018-11-05 10:34:17 I personally not see the minimum changing the lives of Nigerians bcos prices of commodities will go up. I believe in the empowerment of the Naira, a situation where with N1,000 a good pot of soup can be cooked.
228 2018-11-05 09:58:30 Like Bostock & Zaha before him, Bolasie never should have left us. They are essential to the clubs that nurtured them, but expendable commodities to the "bigger" clubs that want them as bench warmers and for their trade-on value.

287 2018-11-05 03:56:33 I’m not saying I tax for anything? Obviously we need those things, in fact everyone should need those things equally, you should  include the military on your list as well. But commodities or particular needs should be left private or with minimal tax, anything else is theft.
288 2018-11-05 03:49:11 The #Packers are in their seventh game and they still cannot get the play in to the offense on time. Timeouts are needed commodities in tight games, which this has shaped up to be.
289 2018-11-05 03:44:53 FYI, according to the UN, the full cost is $5500/ton. Canada pays $30/ton and everything has gone up ALOT. All commodities like food, fuel, heating, services, you name it.
