40 2018-06-27 23:56:09 Sounds like people need to get off Twitter &!focus on getting their fiat money right. If you're broke cuz you put all your money into crypto lol. Esp if you're expecting to get rich overnight. Man don't invest. It's a good lesson to learn and will help alot of people in future
41 2018-06-27 23:56:06 The other way to look at it is, 99% of my ltc was purchased under $5. I'm happy to buy ltc at a higher price to help pump the value up. Helps my bags. Crypto is a crazy space. Many people got in at $50 btc but lost patience. Best 401k ever imo.
42 2018-06-27 23:55:56 Thank you!!

63 2018-06-27 23:51:26 Yeah but for a crypto that is less than a year old we ain’t doin too bad. Real progress takes time and I’m a patient man. And relentless self marketing does work. Just look at where it got Trump. White House.

66 2018-06-27 23:50:55 No, Crypto currencies did.

71 2018-06-27 23:50:06 I got lots of money left. Whoever is broke from investing it all into crypto I feel sorry for. I think it's a very small %

Please see thread:
78 2018-06-27 23:49:36 Without many cards, buying on market is usually better if you can't afford the extra overhead of running a mining rig. After a few cards, spec mining has been the best ROI in crypto for me hand over fist.

81 2018-06-27 23:49:24 What assumptions are being made by those who want NOOOO part of crypto?  There are myriad crypto traders who have no interest In traditional markets but they aren’t flinging poo and casting doubt.  Stinks of fear and resentment.
82 2018-06-27 23:48:59 IMO a coin has it's own blockchain while a token is built on a different chain with a smart contract

90 2018-06-27 23:47:13 Oh man, it took time believe me, now I am inmune. I have always been good in my life controlling emotion at critical times, stocks and crypto def help me a ton with that, also helped me develop my patience, if you learn to master both, you will have 80% of the race in your pocket

94 2018-06-27 23:46:18 This would be rather a mid/long-term hold for me (probably 2-3 years or more). Prices develop slower than in crypto.
Whatever target you set, it would be wise to take profits on the way up. If you miss some of the ride it doesn't matter, there are plenty of other opportunities!

97 2018-06-27 23:45:46 I love it. It’s a nice stable site and the ability to do playlists and the artists and the curators get notes is great. I’m completely enjoying being on there. Soon notes will be able to be traded in for gift cards. Real world crypto use, and easy to do.
98 2018-06-27 23:45:43 Right to work states suck. Social emotional health, especially for family death, should be an understood condition.  Heartless bastards.
99 2018-06-27 23:45:39 Hahaha, likewise If it makes you feel better, the component of incentives due to direct monetization does cover many of the fiduciary risks you mention, which is why I continuously mention the "rituals" of launching a crypto. I'm not a fan of all game theory, but some does apply.

137 2018-06-27 23:38:25 Would simply lead to global acceptance and mass adoption. Where we are today is just a speck of dust in the crypto  universe. Migrating from physical to a digitised token global economy is the way forward. Example; @GibBlockEx  and few early adopters.

143 2018-06-27 23:36:24 I absolutely agree.  You'll see people troll me for networks I walked away from because the civil liability was so great that it made the projects untenable, even if they were popular among crypto folks who felt let down.  But here's my concern...
144 2018-06-27 23:35:39 to stay away from yobit. Well how the fuck should I stay away from the very first exchange that hexx had. and eventually they removed yobit from their website too.  Very unprofessional and shitty team behind. The project might be good but team is fucked up.

147 2018-06-27 23:35:11 @Cryptos_Aus Hey Beau! I was wondering if you know how gifting Crypto to family/friends is considered tax wise in Australia? I asked Angus about it and he wasn't quite sure. thanks for all your great work and your new site looks really cool

150 2018-06-27 23:34:44 I did not know this existed. But since CT I’ve found FB even more toxic than saltseason. And no crypto. Garbage all around
151 2018-06-27 23:34:37 Crypto = ded.  See you all in 2-3 years
152 2018-06-27 23:34:23 There's a Being John Malcovich somewhere in this story with Mac!
153 2018-06-27 23:34:17 It's critical for newbies entering the market, not for intermediate or veterans. In order for crypto to scale, the answer has to be "very".

157 2018-06-27 23:33:17 Too many people buying one crypto coin after another, rotating in and out, based purely on what they hear in a chat channel or the look of a white paper.  When it doesn’t move in 3 days they sell for a loss and chase the next dream coin.
158 2018-06-27 23:33:12 Bitcoins had nothing to do with it. It was Velvets 600bbl/d monsters on lands that just offset them. There’s no scale for crypto’s when it comes to gas to power generation. Great ROI’s, but it doesn’t even move IBR’s dial on a absolute basis

183 2018-06-27 23:27:50 What you will come to understand is that every point that is made in the crypto space is so minute on the twitter scale, that every thing needs to be retweeted so a wider audience can be reached. So yeah sometimes I can be a news mill.

193 2018-06-27 23:24:36 I mean more like, there's some open source project (could be crypto, or not) and crypto is integrated like:

1) pay to prioritize response to your issue
2) post & pay bounties for contributions / bugfixes
3) voting on new proposals by stakeholders

only 3) maybe needs own token

210 2018-06-27 23:22:27 I've seen a lot of people suggest subtly that crypto is a zero sum game vs other assets (that it essentially needs to take value from them).  This isn't the case.  Technological advances are creating new value at an exponential rate (the world as a whole is getting richer)
211 2018-06-27 23:22:23 I'm sorry, but tweeting about #Dash isn't good enough. Dash provided you with a serious amount of money. It's rather disrespectful to the Dash community when your company doesn't respond to requests.

Staked tokens could allow one to mark spam (and gain more $BIRD). Mark the wrong content, lose your staked tokens.
299 2018-06-27 23:06:43 So accurate 
300 2018-06-27 23:06:27 Can't... Thanks!
301 2018-06-27 23:06:23 I don't really have a view on the macro economy
302 2018-06-27 23:05:44 Hey @NexoFinance and @PundiXLabs why dont you guys have a partnership to allow us to spend our crypto backed usdt loans using the xpass card? That would be sweet!
303 2018-06-27 23:05:35 Hell yeah Stache! I would be honored! You name the date and time ( as long as it doesn’t conflict with Jeopardy) and we are good!! LOL I’m just kidding, I’m not that old!!
304 2018-06-27 23:04:56 I can't believe I actually have to say this. Jesus crypto tweeter is getting even more stupid than I thought possible.

306 2018-06-27 23:04:27 Can’t get easier? Or it can?
307 2018-06-27 23:04:24 I've heard a bit of chatter on that one.  What's the top feature about the coin you like?  Is it a POS coin?
308 2018-06-27 23:04:24 How many AI and crypto startups went searching for a problem to solve and ended up with a “normal” business to solve it?
309 2018-06-27 23:04:15 Every trade my first 30 days in crypto 
310 2018-06-27 23:04:14 New respect for content creators after meeting some at a blockchain conf. They all work tirelessly, often full time, especially the ones who care deeply about crypto.

@ummjackson how do you balance working at Adobe, Dogecoining and creating YouTube content for 27K people? 
311 2018-06-27 23:04:13 of course you're gonna say I'm not being clear! have fun with british crypto poetry
312 2018-06-27 23:04:09 Seriously if you don't think a secure chain is important you need to get out of crypto. Bet you hodl verge.

316 2018-06-27 23:03:21 I remember in he 80s when we had refugees from the DDR at home they where very suprised about all the proucts we have in the supermarket. They didn't know what brands where. In socialist countries they don't have choice :D
317 2018-06-27 23:03:10 @litecoin_bull what are some of the key milestones that need to happen for $LTC to hit $10k down the road? I.e. $BTC reaching a certain price threshold? $LTC supply restriction by way of mining difficulty? Key adoption partnerships? Crypto market cap levels?
318 2018-06-27 23:03:09 I'm saying false, only because this same logic has destroyed some people's lives this year. People said it was an "amazing opportunity" when BTC was $8900... and the entire crypto market has dropped 50% since then even

434 2018-06-27 22:39:30 So Mark Zuckerberg lifts bans on crypto ads on FB and rumors starting to fly of him wanting to purchase coinbase? Cant beat them i guess buy them.  good news all around.

438 2018-06-27 22:38:59 Camping in the woods Monday night and I suddenly get lots of interesting thoughts on the crypto #fiction novel I'm writing with @JLPorterAuthor CRYPTO CITIZENS Must be the junipers. Blame it on the junipers. Or the government. Maybe I just got far enough away from them.

458 2018-06-27 22:35:32 @IOHK_Charles I have a question about value-stability and crypto (particularly utility tokens) that no-one else seems able to answer. You're the person I'd most love to hear an answer from. I know ur busy, but this seems integral to uptake of all cryptos, inc ADA. May I DM you?
459 2018-06-27 22:35:21 That is the problem. Given those odds it would be like, the Norwegian I am, calling them out on their cliche American backpatting crypto-imperial brofisting shit. I would be called a freak.

462 2018-06-27 22:35:05 Step 1 when researching new #crypto projects:

Research the team.  Can you find them on LinkedIn , Facebook or just google the fuck out of them.   

Can someone please add more steps because I’m still stuck at Step 1 for most of my coins.....
463 2018-06-27 22:34:58 It is a very good price and the indicators are showing bullish signals. Nothing wrong with picking some up at this price as long as you’re willing to except a drop when BTC goes lower.
464 2018-06-27 22:34:37 Wow Dave is a real winner good job hiring the least crypto knowledgeable person in this space @Newton_NCP . Why don’t ask him few quiz questions about your whitepaper that he should read by now ? Money well spent I’m sure
465 2018-06-27 22:34:35 I'm yet no to learn to trade so all this helps. I've been in Crypto since Jan 2018 and lost alot. I would love to make it back.
466 2018-06-27 22:34:18 That sounds like an illegal crypto currency ad right there. Against Twitter regulations 23456456 in the manual page 942 paragraph 64.

470 2018-06-27 22:34:01 Is Facebook buying @coinbase ? Would that really have any impact on the #crypto market? Or is this more rumors like Amazon using crypto and $BTC to the moon? lol
471 2018-06-27 22:33:55 No! I really did! 
472 2018-06-27 22:33:43 there's got to be a bunch of attempts to use crypto to support / govern open source projects.  What are the most successful?  What are the failures so far?

480 2018-06-27 22:31:57 After banning all crypto related ads in January, now Facebook changed its mind: crypto ads are ok, ICO ads remain banned. Perfect 

The problem is that @Independent also spread the rumor that @facebook is BUYING @coinbase. #FAKENEWS Ok??

488 2018-06-27 22:29:57 A very interesting read. Its important to discuss the changing regulations in the crypto world since they are so influential in innovation and progress.
489 2018-06-27 22:29:52 Distributed remote teams have played a small role in traditional startup innovation. 

Geographical clusters have fueled most innovation. How and why would crypto change that.

560 2018-06-27 22:16:38 I’m learning so much in crypto. Not just about the financial market, but international relations and even political landscapes. This space is filled with many opportunities and outlets to learn and grow. It’s very mind-stimulating. I’ve learned more in crypto than in college.

565 2018-06-27 22:15:37 No, but it will go into a soft round peak just as crypto market cap drops into similarly shaped bottom, and as both curves round out...... We will experience trend reversal. Still looks to be a few months out. At least.
566 2018-06-27 22:15:36 Haha i have a weak spot for #electroneum 
It's aim is to get utter n00bs into crypto ...

So technically, I was that n00b - so their premise worked.

Enough of the 100% staking, we need to let go of #PCN and look forward to $DAPS. I’m personally against 2nd snapshot...

651 2018-06-27 21:57:36 So I say the same thing back to you. TA people need to add a disclaimer that says if you have less than 2 years of trading experience you should hodl. Crypto can go up 500% in 3 days. I've made money trading but i would have made way more money if I held.
652 2018-06-27 21:57:27 This just gives a bad name to crypto. All the world is seeing is crypto being used for porn sites. Don’t congratulate this crap. If anything, this degraded these coins.

717 2018-06-27 21:46:37 Thanks Evan! Excited to get the crypto community involved

720 2018-06-27 21:46:28 Ugh so jealous. Ive been in crypto since December 2017. Cant wait to finally have people i can talk crypto too lol
721 2018-06-27 21:46:28 The timing of the listing was unfortunate but as you said, nothing has changed with the progress. Minor speed bump in the road for $ppi. I’ll say it again as I have before Q.3 for $ppi is going to be .  Good on ya for keeping it real with us, $crypto needs more devs like you.
722 2018-06-27 21:46:19 All ERC20 deposits and withdrawals are now available again. Thank you for your patience! #SlayIT
723 2018-06-27 21:46:15 I have been studying and monitoring both BTC and EUR/USD and after about 6 months I feel that I have a better sense of what FX will do than Crypto.  The mentorship so far is awesome.
724 2018-06-27 21:46:10 これはETCか。イーサリアムがハードフォークした結果生まれた通貨だ。theDAOの事件があった後、イーサリアムが「事件が起きなかった時のチェーンまで巻き戻します」と実質的なロールバックを行って、それに怒った採掘者たちが反発して今日まで動いている。まぁ思想の違うイーサリアムだな。

727 2018-06-27 21:45:19 C'est ça ..mais généralement ce sont déjà des insiders...enfin c'est mon impression. Je suis peut etre trop "en haut" du cryptotwitter pour ne pas connaître tous les nouveaux shitcoin à pump
728 2018-06-27 21:45:14 I have not seen this confirmed and it’s not in the medium post. Where and who said this was 100% happening?
729 2018-06-27 21:45:12 I can handle em myself. I just need someone to pupn this. Maybe @Crypto_Bitlord the ripple master himself !!! 
He’s going to block me i presume. Crap.
730 2018-06-27 21:45:11 Where do you get these periods and dates for the contracts
731 2018-06-27 21:45:02 That would be awesome. I’ll be over at Crypto Space in San Pedro doing a trading meet up

733 2018-06-27 21:44:12 Well if the upcoming months are going to be painful, you should sell now, and buy back in when the pain is near its end. No? Why hold through the pain when you can skip it?
734 2018-06-27 21:44:04 No you don't lose them. I bought more too. The PCN you had yesterday youll get 1:1 DAPS. Newly purchased PCN will be airdropped free DAPS at a ratio less than 1:1
735 2018-06-27 21:43:11 Pas seulement le early, mais celui qui était "in" quand le mcap était de 200 000
736 2018-06-27 21:42:12 I'm surprised that:

1) Some think that this is the ONLY area of tech that should not have patents

2) People don't understand that a patent grant is a statement of novelty from the patent office

3) Some think that intellectual property is not property

This is the real world.

753 2018-06-27 21:38:32 Completely agree, but I think it will be the initial bridge between the masses and the crypto world, if only because it is the crypto that they will have at least heard of when they decide to put their toe in the water.
754 2018-06-27 21:37:50 Oh ight lmao, but just in case newer traders see this post just want them to know this doesn't mean anything. .  So many new people being scared away from the market through seeing these things. Just had a friend give up after a week in crypto thanks to crypto Twitter scaring him
755 2018-06-27 21:37:26 Lmao thats perfect
756 2018-06-27 21:37:14 Honnêtement ça fait 1 an et demi que je suis vraiment rentré dans le game. Mais je parlais surtout du early investor par rapport au $pcn qui lui s'est plaisir
757 2018-06-27 21:37:11 That's what I thought.
758 2018-06-27 21:37:04 Good lookin out, thanks man

761 2018-06-27 21:36:39 Considering that Alt Thirty Six basically owes it's existence to #Dash, you'd think they'd be a little more forthcoming.
762 2018-06-27 21:36:35 I think most of the criticism came from overhyping the ‘biggest partnership in crypto’ which would make it a ‘top three coin’, when really it’s just a payment option on a porn site. Tron tweeted about it- that’s about all the hype it deserves.
763 2018-06-27 21:36:29 The best marker of a good crypto project in 2018 — the team avoids ICO/TGE/crowdsale as much as possible.

768 2018-06-27 21:35:33 Other tweeters diss me. Say my crypto's scam-ay. Why? Why? Wha what why? Be more constructive with your retweets, please.
769 2018-06-27 21:34:48 U do crypto tho?
770 2018-06-27 21:34:37 @ryanlpwest really convinced on crypto i see lol
771 2018-06-27 21:34:36 when you express your opinion on twitter, do not expect everyone to applaud you.
probably is a lack of knowledge by my part, or probably you have to accept that you are not perfect and you make mistakes like everyone else .

782 2018-06-27 21:31:29 It's the same principle of FBI asking Apple to build a back door for iPhone access.  The centralized system existing for centuries, where the point of crypto was to move away from that system.
783 2018-06-27 21:31:16 The ‘big guys’ are preparing to enter the crypto market, expect more bullish news to come now we are quickly reaching the bottom and bags are getting filled by big players. Facebook #crypto ban reversal is just the beginning. We are almost there.

#crypto #NEO $BTC
788 2018-06-27 21:30:45 South East Asian countries presents very fertile ground for investments. #Crypto start ups like #Traxion which proffers solution to the unbanked would see massive influx when more crypto investors from other side of the globe learns about the adoption in these areas
789 2018-06-27 21:30:32 We are the Parliament @CoinParliament #cryptoking
790 2018-06-27 21:30:28 Utility tokens will be the main key to adding value to a #crypto assets. Projects like #Traxion that offers services to people through the blockchain will be the ones to see massive adoption in the near future
791 2018-06-27 21:30:10 I believe #Traxion will transition the world to a #crypto ready society where will get to use our cryptocurrencies to pay for our everyday utility bills. The anti money laundry feature of the project is another thing that will reduce crime in use of crypto and build up trust
792 2018-06-27 21:29:43 I only got into crypto a couple of months ago.
I watched all the money I put in whittle down to -60%. 
Inexperienced & not feeling positive I felt it was a bad decision.
After learning as much as I can & reading what I can...I feel more optimistic each & every day! $BTC
793 2018-06-27 21:29:35 I just don’t think bitcoin and crypto follows typical market cycles to the tee. With miners and unique aspects of this market I feel like when it starts going back up again it’ll run hard once again. Maybe I am wrong and maybe all markets follow emotional cycles. We shall see!

The bank is a financial institution that keeps YOUR money, lends that money to someone else, makes more money from it and charges you monthly/annually for keeping YOUR money with some daily limits to withdraw YOUR money.

877 2018-06-27 21:13:32 That’s the problem in crypto right now: no one wants to spend what they think will appreciate in value. This happened in China long ago when the dynasty (forgot which) instituted gold coins over paper money. No one wanted to spend them and the system crashed. USE YOUR CRYPTO

985 2018-06-27 20:56:50 Some say we're only here for money. I'm not. It was hope and belief in the technology that brought me to crypto and it keeps me going in these times. 

I really hope it does what I think it can, and we have a future world with more trust and transparency.

1001 2018-06-27 20:54:13 It is ridiculous how long @Tether_to has been operating sans-audit, with the biggest #crypto exchanges still listing them...what do those exchanges' codes of ethics consist of if lying to your customers for ~2 years is a-ok?
1002 2018-06-27 20:54:01 You know what the problem is with #crypto these days? The #FIFA world cup! People are all distracted from the important things like buying #litecoin... Yup! That must be it. So the bear market ends on 15th of July. Problem solved!

1007 2018-06-27 20:53:39 I couldn't agree more! Both Him & @dukeleto are legit wizards & their knowledge of blockchains seems endless. @KomodoPlatform has to be the most under-rated crypto/blockchain service

1012 2018-06-27 20:53:03 Yep, even in crypto it's generally assumed that people who shill coins are doing it for their own gain because they have a bag they want to dump on people. I definitely wouldn't consider what you were doing shilling - you were just trying to help people spot a good  opportunity.

1031 2018-06-27 20:49:29 The big issue is that there's a hurry up and grow up conundrum to Crypto, the article writers, the Altcoins and their mgmt teams.  It's a fifth grade vibe. That's like pestering Jason Tatum about that fourth NBA championship and MVP award instead of organic development.
1032 2018-06-27 20:49:17 A speaker at the Crypto Evolved conference says the industry knows how to regulate itself. Points to F/X.

1048 2018-06-27 20:45:45 @overridepro Hey Justin - really worried about the crypto market. If it continues to spiral downwards, does SUB have the funds to continue operating? I.e. are you guys backed by an investor? There’s a lot of unrest and I’d hate to see the project not reach its potential...
1049 2018-06-27 20:45:43 I hate #Apple's policies about crypto currency wallets.

The #vertcoin has already given up. Excellent project BTW. 

Same goes for $Pivx team. $Nano team got lucky though.

Retail will raise the crypto-currencies to a new level, the solution and acceleration of processes in retail trade bears the revolution.
1118 2018-06-27 20:34:51 none of you like $EOS, $TRX, $XRP. i get it, the fundamentals are disreputable. this isn't the traditional equities market, this is crypto. come alt season, these will blow minds
1119 2018-06-27 20:34:43 Uncanny parallels between p2p file sharing era and current crypto evolution

1124 2018-06-27 20:34:28 okay.  so guessing i need to keep my pcn wallet address handy?
1125 2018-06-27 20:34:06 I am still confident you can tell people to buy #crypto if they are fine with letting their crypto rest for a year or two. I think hardly anyone doubts that in 2 years, the market will look VERY different.
1126 2018-06-27 20:33:32 Down this half of the year maybe up a bit next half over time this whole crypto thing should still work out. Especially thanks to good people like those working with $DGB but only the whales really know what’s going to happen.

1131 2018-06-27 20:32:53 @Crypto_yann @willbourget @gregory_raymond est-ce que des sociétés de cryptomonnaies ont déjà déposé des brevets pour leur programme au lieu de faire le choix de l'open source ? Ça serait intéressant de savoir si ça existe...
1132 2018-06-27 20:32:41 This is a good sign that a good promising project enters the world of Crypto to do something new, unique and useful #SponsoredTweet
1133 2018-06-27 20:32:40 Thank you. I already have the ability to send tax crypto to CRA on the spot. Unfortunately, I can’t find any info if CRA would accept crypto per transaction. Looking forward to your reply.

1140 2018-06-27 20:31:05 Is Bitcoin going up soon? I have seen a few "news" articles today stating BTC $x price by end of 2018 and apparently Facebook unbanning Crypto Ads - Last time we saw "news" like this we had a nice bull run... its definitely time for one (at least for me)...
1141 2018-06-27 20:30:17 Fucking missed that wave dammit 
1142 2018-06-27 20:30:16 @topbtc_com PLEASE HELP:  I am having trouble withdrawing my crypto (OMG) from your exchange.  Can you please assist real-time to help get me through the issues?  Thanks in advance,

1145 2018-06-27 20:29:33 Only 130? lets hear how many Fiat cases they have 
1146 2018-06-27 20:29:27 I'd be worried about crypto fall more if the inferior coins were falling more than the good ones (eg, Ripple vs. Ether), because it would suggest the market is rationally pricing things.
1147 2018-06-27 20:29:24 Where the heck is Crypto Owen at now? Is he full on Lupe?
1148 2018-06-27 20:29:19 C'est con il y a un moment ou ils nous laissent plus regarder les pubs, et désolé mais le trucs de miner la crypto monnaie ça utilise 100% de mon processeur donc bof bof XD
1149 2018-06-27 20:29:14 The innovation of TBC is not in the technology of crypto-currency; its in how this currency is valued and priced.  TBC is the First “Abundance-Based” currency and have tied its value to community growth and not the market.  The Mission of TBC is to End Poverty globally in 2018.
1150 2018-06-27 20:28:57 bullish on crypto today. somebody is buying this bottom. if Asia market can continue momentum we could see more upside in the short term. overall bearish sentiment is my counter indicator for an upward move. #btc #eth

1154 2018-06-27 20:27:54 Tbf they did say they were tokenising the world and one look at the world shows us what the problem with that us.
1155 2018-06-27 20:27:34 Nope. Heard it the other day on crypto Twitter. Worth researching more.
1156 2018-06-27 20:27:33 Sadly this is true ... whether we like it or not

Great few weeks in #crypto !
1176 2018-06-27 20:24:03 The product was difficult and expensive to build, but it is there - you can actually use our tech. So that's one. Two, our support team is one of the best on the market (immodest, I know). Three, we'll reveal our identities soon, just have to iron out some legal crinkles.
1177 2018-06-27 20:23:57 I believe #Traxion will transition the world to a #crypto ready society where will get to use our cryptocurrencies to pay for our everyday utility bills. The anti money laundry feature of the project is another thing that will reduce crime in use of crypto and build up trust

1180 2018-06-27 20:23:33 what do you think off crypto's?
1181 2018-06-27 20:23:26 Very quiet interesting, a good project that all crypto lovers may used into it.
1182 2018-06-27 20:23:25 South East Asian countries presents very fertile ground for investments. #Crypto start ups like #Traxion which proffers solution to the unbanked would see massive influx when more crypto investors from other side of the globe learns about the adoption in these areas
1183 2018-06-27 20:23:18 everyone can accept trx as a currency.. it’s not trons fault
1184 2018-06-27 20:23:16 And it’s good to see conmerciel usage. That’s a big part of crypto purchase ofcourse. Since porn allegedly pay creditcard fees of around 30% (because if high refund request rates) $TRX makes sense. Lower prices, higher profits and easier to pay producers globally.
1185 2018-06-27 20:23:03 One thing i know for sure crypto travel will be popular! although there already is some fierce competition in this niche i am sure roomdao will be one of the winners!
1186 2018-06-27 20:22:37 Utility tokens will be the main key to adding value to a #crypto assets. Projects like #Traxion that offers services to people through the blockchain will be the ones to see massive adoption in the near future
1187 2018-06-27 20:22:33 There are 2 guys in the crypto space that I can keep listening for hours with full focus: Andreas and Charles.
1188 2018-06-27 20:22:29 #Traxion tech focuses majorly in the unbanked and transitioning them into a #crypto ready society with a real life application of #blockchain technology. What will happen to this project when it hits the most populous and underbanked areas of the world
1189 2018-06-27 20:22:06 Referring to the bcash withdrawal delay...

1247 2018-06-27 20:14:33 absolutely crypto would be globally adopted at a way quicker pace w/ FB. Coinbase growing quicker with the backing of over $500B is a no brainer, however, I still don't believe either FB would completely enter this space at its current state and doubt CB would sell now

1257 2018-06-27 20:13:09 I’m not calling for a multi year bear market. I’m saying this isn’t the bottom and that once we DO bottom we will have a period of accumulation before the next bull run. How long that period is is anyone’s guess, but I do agree that crypto will likely move faster.

1261 2018-06-27 20:11:43 wouldn’t there some sort of conflict of interest since bitmain controls the majority of the hashrate?

1263 2018-06-27 20:11:37 It's almost like we're doing the exact same stuff that hasn't worked for the past 500 years, but just throwing a blockchain in the middle of it
1264 2018-06-27 20:11:22 Not a coincidence, don’t think they thought they were gonna be battered for it. ETC’s being done much better.

1266 2018-06-27 20:11:12 Yup. My immediate thought: Kennedy revealed himself to be a crypto-Nazi by letting Trump replace him. 

It’s for life. He could choose to hang in there. This signals he’s fine with the current political climate replacing him.

$Crypto is a wild beast & sometimes needs to be treated as such. I don't mean be wild, I mean have a wild approach.

1339 2018-06-27 20:01:51 Binance always seems really transparent with their customers. They're a large, growing exchange. The more money that comes into crypto the more money that will be going on Binance and into BNB. I don't think it's ever a bad idea to bet on the house. Can't see BNB crashing to zero

1341 2018-06-27 20:01:43 I think it’s the inversion of priority that modern crypto needs to show before telling, and that a design paper is more tell than it is show. Modern crypto tries to fundraise the risk out of developing an alternative to something that already works.
1342 2018-06-27 20:01:26 Disastrous if true.

But on the other hand they already have a hand in everyones life so they could force crypto-adoption on everyone .

1374 2018-06-27 19:56:36 Both are a gamble at this point as google glass was a bad product, where as crypto currency is not volatile, not supported, no government controlled, not stable, and won’t amount to much in society.

1393 2018-06-27 19:53:59 Yea there is a community member that doesnt want to drive price down, ill be looking to pick some up once funds freed up. Keep an eye on it.
1394 2018-06-27 19:53:56 I don’t like were this conversation is going... no underwear.... rubbing off on you... we all need to take a step back!! I will go on the show. You WILL wear underwear. AND no one is rubbing anything!!!
1395 2018-06-27 19:53:40 The lack of crypto is the root of all evil.
1396 2018-06-27 19:53:39 I’m not into crypto currency for pumps, I want to invest in a project that has real world properties and gain in value because of ownership, leadership, marketing, potential, and transparency. Those are qualities I found in TRON/TRX
1397 2018-06-27 19:53:10 I have to face it. I made money, because I had luck. Most of CT is bullish and I don’t understand why. What if the majority of small investors got burned so bad that they left crypto for good? What if possible new investors won’t be willing to get burned? 1/2
1398 2018-06-27 19:53:07 Is that good or bad? Too few?  Too many?
1399 2018-06-27 19:53:02 Lol I think this is a bullish reply and I’m not referring to your tweet, but Jesus Christ, crypto twitter is one of the most negative environments one can visit. Idk if it’s mostly all kids on here but it’s really sad the way people treat each other in this space.
1400 2018-06-27 19:53:02 Buying #Bitcoin in late december is a similar feeling to what #Germany feels after being wasted like that from the world cup.

1420 2018-06-27 19:50:38 Not necessarily, watch my latest YouTube video. The point I am making here is that if this is a complete market cycle I am expecting further downside followed by a period of accumulation for a number of months. Not necessarily three years. Crypto seems to be moving much faster.
1421 2018-06-27 19:50:32 @felix2feng Really exciting work you're doing at Set, would love to do an interview with you and share your team's progress with the world of crypto. DM me if interested!

1424 2018-06-27 19:50:17 You seem to be equivocating 'centralized'. BTC minibg itself is not centralized, the fact that some nodes will have more activity than others is obvious but not that much of a concern, as long as the underlining protocol holds to decentralization as a core principle. It does.

1442 2018-06-27 19:47:29 That reminds me of all the people bragging about being into "crypto" before me. 

And I always think "and this part still confuses you."

This stuff is hard. Very hard. But one of the basic insights you should have learned early is that economics can't be done via experiments.

1446 2018-06-27 19:47:18 Dumb announcement. Don’t be like XVG
1447 2018-06-27 19:46:51 "Start Up [X] is zapping up customers, but there's just no way [Governmental Body X] doesn't step in & snuff it out."

This almost never happens. 

They said it was gonna happen w/ ride sharing. They said it was gonna happen w/ Crypto. 

Governments are no match for consumers.

1458 2018-06-27 19:45:30 What I hate about #crypto is that it makes people believe in get-rich-quick schemes all over again. When you have the option to pay off your CC #debt vs. investing in #bitcoin, too many people choose to do the latter.
1459 2018-06-27 19:45:28 Yes like @l3l2ucelee said it's still run by some great entrepreneurs. 
1460 2018-06-27 19:45:26 I think Ms. Wu just wants to shill her crypto shit here. Coinbase would not be in the top 5 Chinese companies. Great, but all big companies in China are basically state controlled at some point. The CCP's tentacles are far reaching.

1471 2018-06-27 19:44:03 FB would make coinbase 1000X bigger than it is today 1000X faster than coinbase ever could alone. Imagine a coin wallet on every messanger, whatsapp and facebook account. The world would become all crypto and no fiat.

1473 2018-06-27 19:43:44 Asking Peter crypto related questions is just silly. He don't get it nor will he ever 'get' it. He's too busy tooting his own horn and dodging any questions that hold him accountable to his bad call in gold. "It'll rise 'someday', is not a answer. It's him protecting his ass.
1474 2018-06-27 19:43:30 great idea

1481 2018-06-27 19:42:16 yup, a few seconds after I hit submit :-)  But new ones pop up constantly. Almost every tweet Elon makes gets followed up by an impersonator account trying to convince people to send crypto currency.

1483 2018-06-27 19:42:08 Some of the uncertainty around #crypto products is self inflicted, says SEC official on the regulatory panel at #CryptoEvolved. Just because an asset exists on a distributed ledger shouldn't change the trading protocol of that asset, they add.

1489 2018-06-27 19:41:10 Crypto exchanges, do not provide either cash or asset insurance. The only exceptions are Coinbase and Gemini, but they only insure cash deposits..... this is only one of many differences. And too many people treat this coins like stocks, which is completely wrong.

1527 2018-06-27 19:34:43 Everyone knows China is huge, and that they are deep in crypto. From mining, exchanges and projects ($neo etc).

But it is a single party state that has several crypto related bans. That is the black cloud over China and crypto. Will it clear is the question?

1552 2018-06-27 19:30:43 I don't think uncle Xi will allow a censorship resistant SOV/crypto under his reign. Freedom and China is an oxymoron imo. Xi wants full centralised control in the dystopia Chinas is turning into more and more.

1625 2018-06-27 19:19:11 Yes, but there's not a huge market for speculative investments, especially in rural areas. That said, I could imagine a cash for crypto physical agent model working if a stable coin tried to compete with mobile money.
1626 2018-06-27 19:18:59 Those same people lost A LOT of money after crypto currency took a historic crash (for crypto currency) and it hasn’t climbed back.

1627 2018-06-27 19:18:47 Many people don't have time and/or don't care to learn how to do that.

1665 2018-06-27 19:15:14 When crypto starts pumping again... crypto twitter will be a lot more lively... Been kind of dead lately.
1666 2018-06-27 19:15:07 Lol letting your secrets out 
1667 2018-06-27 19:15:03 Rarement, en crypto, c'est tout ce que ça prend! Dans les deux cas, je suis prêt pour une hausse comme une baisse. Des deux côtés, j'en profite. Alors on reste à l'affût :)
1668 2018-06-27 19:14:52 @CivitasCoin should be on the list
1669 2018-06-27 19:14:51 I have been following this for a while now. The interesting thing is it is the same for every single crypto on coinmarketcap with the exception of a few. No exchange have have every single coin. So how does"whales" manupilate the market?  The only common denominator is the USD??
1670 2018-06-27 19:14:37 $EOS launched a yr long ICO, raised 4-fucking-BILLION dollars, had all the resources available & what do they have to show for it? Just lulz! 

U want a professional setup in crypto, who have thr shit under control, look no further, #Vechain will take over! $VEN $VET $VTHO

1672 2018-06-27 19:14:35 If I would run a node on your platform, who holds the private keys? And what's the cost involved?
1673 2018-06-27 19:14:19 豆知識②：HuobiはピンインでもHuobiと書きます。火（huǒ）は中国語で「人気のある」「ホットな」という意味なので、中の人はHuobiが人気取引所になれるようにという願いを込めたのでしょう（テキトー予想）
1674 2018-06-27 19:14:00 This graph doesn't serve this argument. Gold has value beyond it being used as a currency and the amount of fiat currency in circulation is far and away more than all of crypto. 

There are a lot of great arguments for crypto, but comparative energy use is not one.
1675 2018-06-27 19:13:53 China'll not strengthen yuan without some serious trade concessions from Trump. Negotiations are not halted yet, so the #CNY exchange rate is one of main 'trumps' of China to pressure US. But Chinese authorities are not eager to stimulate a rapid uncontrolled decline of yuan.

1679 2018-06-27 19:13:08 For all we know, this may not have been #tron 's decision. 

I don't think there's anything stopping a business from accepting crypto if they desire (although dependent on national laws). 

In other words, I don't think they would have to partner with, or, get approved by tron.
1680 2018-06-27 19:13:00 So you give them monero from your stash, or how does that work?
1681 2018-06-27 19:13:00 Many millions lost for me too.

1684 2018-06-27 19:12:58 I still have a strong, positive attitude for #crypto, despite all that has happened in the past 24 hours. I would try to work things out with @DAPScoin rather than be angry at the situation.  #cryptotwitter #BTC $DAPS $PCN
1685 2018-06-27 19:12:55 Lol for real!
1686 2018-06-27 19:12:43 In the past, there were coins that had some intrinsic value. Then the world started using paper currency that has no intrinsic value of its own but it is at least tangible. Now we are going to have crypto currency that is neither tangible nor has any intrinsic value.

1692 2018-06-27 19:12:08 Facebook mate and it’s not even close. As a “cryptocurrency enthusiast” you should be doing everything in your power to NOT let this happen. If FB buys Coinbase the corporotacracy wins and kills everything that anyone who was bullish on the real purpose of crypto dreams about.
1693 2018-06-27 19:12:02 have a look at $PCN who scammed today ...blindly following these unknown shitcoins can cost you massively ......anything can happen in this market....try to follow major Alts
1694 2018-06-27 19:12:00 Agreed ... and that type of HODL is flat out idiocy. Learning that HODL is a meme is one of the game changers in my personal crypto journey.
1695 2018-06-27 19:12:00 The smiling I can't do any more. Not just cops, but regular people too. I can't smile at people who will most likely pretend I don't exist just b/c their experience takes place in a sheltered unrealistic environment. I mean sometimes people go out the way to ignore black people?

1701 2018-06-27 19:11:26 And OTC. People aren’t used to stealth crypto. 
1702 2018-06-27 19:11:21 Not giving any advice chap, just commenting on what I saw people doing, which I found foolish.

I can be pretty dumb sometimes. I wear the badge to remind myself not to do dumb shit.
1713 2018-06-27 19:10:19 If it is $NEO why arent they saying it. It does sound like it but sury neo is already patented
1714 2018-06-27 19:10:12 Ik gun hem iedereen, maar verkopen als je hem niet hoeft terwijl je hem ook aan iemand kan geven ouders, vrienden whatever.
1715 2018-06-27 19:10:06 it is so bad times for crypto currencies. hope the market can get better sooner.

1719 2018-06-27 19:09:51 STOP buying #PCN there might not be a second snapshot. Unless you’re swing trading it, but if you plan to HODL I would hold off man. Latest update shows second snapshot is not  % go yet....

1723 2018-06-27 19:09:35 As I cost average into the #crypto market, I’m still a firm believer in the following:

- 50% into high cap establishes
- 25% into midcap (enterprise/platform)
- 25% into low cap/moonshots/ICOs

Those numbers may vary by 5% each.
1724 2018-06-27 19:09:28 If I was solely dependent on this crypto shit I would’ve of resorted to smoking crack by now
1725 2018-06-27 19:09:09 Me too, but it's crypto, it's such a fluctuating type of market.  I think it's definately worth putting stuff out there on it, and maybe even updateing any agreements regarding artists, labels and crypto, but it's hard to say if it will pan out.

1769 2018-06-27 19:02:21 Trying to set up my masternode for today showed my just how far away we are from mass Integration into crypto. If as a crypto community we can’t make things simple for the average person people will never get into it and crypto will never grow like we want.
1770 2018-06-27 19:02:20 Great question. Anyone still buying #PCN just stop  hold what I you have and wait. @DAPScoin @colorfinder69 please keep the single snapshot before announcement and nix the second one altogether. #WhenDAPS

1783 2018-06-27 19:01:13 The FUD after that is going to be USA arguing that nongovernmental backed crypto currencies are being used by nation states to circumvent economic sanctions.

1797 2018-06-27 18:59:28 Agree!  Crypto will never get anywhere if everyone is only in it for a quick dollar.  It’s frustrating to say the least
1798 2018-06-27 18:59:25 @ILOVECRYPT0 From your email DECENTRALIZED LOL!! "Since the dawn of crypto assets, the selling point was that there was no human decision making behind the scenes. And if there was, it was DECENTRALIZED. With EOS already censoring transactions, things aren't looking so great. "

1808 2018-06-27 18:58:13 I’ve always found technical analysis a little “crystal ball like” fundamentals are always more important, what are th fundamentals on a crypto network? # nodes # endpoints points (ATMs, eCommerce etc) # trades # amounts invested.

1821 2018-06-27 18:56:24 With 2 billion plus users FB have wider reach than bitcoin or any crypto would.
1822 2018-06-27 18:56:02 My bad too.  Turns out it was this one @blockchainbch  for the event yesterday.
1823 2018-06-27 18:56:01 if i was full time crypto, i'd probly be on 700k followers
1824 2018-06-27 18:55:54 My opinion - crypto currencies have their future, but the mechanism of implementation as an investment resource needs to be improved, as an example -with such a rise in the cost of bitcoin it can not be used for lending.
1825 2018-06-27 18:55:51 I checked a homie who owes me big, out with all his new friends. I had to tell him not to talk to me with his hands & tell them to back the f__K up b/c they had no idea who he really was.
1826 2018-06-27 18:55:51 Spread the word. Write articles on it. Share crypto news on social media. Teach people who dont know about crypto. Test out new wallet feature and give the devs user feedback. Many ways man.
1827 2018-06-27 18:55:46 Is doc going on about how overvalued this is now .Or was that just when me and a few others were in it  #knowhesagenda
1828 2018-06-27 18:55:41 Not yet because crypto has only played out 1%. It is way early atm
1829 2018-06-27 18:55:33 crypto pitches are just... never ending and 100% bad

1840 2018-06-27 18:53:23 Fair enough :) some charts show the interaction of crypto with the USD, tech stocks and other asset classes.  I think it’ll be interesting to see how it all integrates

1849 2018-06-27 18:51:34 The PBIN file is actually cryptographically signed as far as I can tell, so I'm guessing it's a miscommunication somewhere between the engineers and the lawyers in which at some point the word "crypto" fell.

1857 2018-06-27 18:50:05 If #facebook were to acquire #coinbase how do you all think it would change the crypto landscape? IMO it would be a step toward legitimacy and mass adoption..
1858 2018-06-27 18:49:58 That is because mostly newbies to crypto get into ICOs and the old school crypto traders are just looking to dump afterwards... Just my opinion

1909 2018-06-27 18:44:09 Remember when you used to at least pretend the courts weren't political
1910 2018-06-27 18:44:04 I have a real hard time with that as well. Crypto has attracted so much interest, talent and money, I just don’t think it’s reasonsble to use an outdated playbook. Too much action under the surface just about to bubble up to have a crypto winter for much longer, just my 2 cents.
1911 2018-06-27 18:44:02 Bitcoin fell way short of its desired goal as a world currency.  As dreamy as fully autonomous global currencies would be, it doesn't seem likely to happen with PoW tech.  It's time for crypto 2.0
1912 2018-06-27 18:43:47 I’m not saying that is about speed or volume or anything else. Just that, 2014 price action besides “fitting” on every other years chart can’t be compared with now. 2017-18 was a totally different year in crypto and by that I don’t see any reason to fit any bias to “2014 fractal”
1913 2018-06-27 18:43:32 for today the best asset is the Crypto currency, but it is important to choose the currency that will give the maximum profit I think this currency - @Ether_Private #Ether_Private
1914 2018-06-27 18:43:08 Think it through cowboy. If crypto replaces fiat then it it no longer has any transferable value. Hence it becomes the new dollar; meaning the baseline currency. Try and keep up.
1915 2018-06-27 18:42:55 As long as there are traders shorting, prices do not go down. It is a lack of demand that makes the price tank.
1916 2018-06-27 18:42:49 That’s very wise. I’ve been hodling and until now it’s cost me dearly. It’s a thing you sort of gradually slide in to. Good thing you got out in time. Hopefully you can get back in at the right moment, also a hard thing to do.
1917 2018-06-27 18:42:46 Whine, whine, whine, it's warm in England. But then I remember that I used to live in Abu Dhabi where you just can't do anything during summer and then it's all right. Actually perfect.
1918 2018-06-27 18:42:41 Haha same. Haven't touched fifa since crypto. Don't really miss it either :)
1919 2018-06-27 18:42:40 Everyone in the community should care about them, if crypto is going to really go mainstream we need mass market adoption, arrogance in crypto is what risks the sector all together.
1920 2018-06-27 18:42:32 Fear & knee jerk reactions, that's why. As far as I'm concerned, this should be it, the snapshot yesterday is the one to work off, & let $PCN die like it's meant to.

1923 2018-06-27 18:41:53 Lastly the market is in turmoil. It effects crypto. Right now people are on hold with their money. They are moving to bonds. If we played our cards right since January they would have been flocking to crypto. They are looking to go somewhere and now it looks like bond mkt
1924 2018-06-27 18:41:47 Ha!  Well, at least you know you can multi-task with the best of them, Zerpenator! I'm happy you enjoyed the blog as well.  The crypto market might be in agony, but I've never been more confident about @ripple and #xrp.  We will get there. Thanks for the kind words & tweet!
1925 2018-06-27 18:41:08 Sure.
1926 2018-06-27 18:41:05 I love this response It doesn't bother me any more! Leave #Amerikkka like it's a threat. Like other countries don't have better laws about how government treats people. It's not the only game in town, people who've lived elsewhere with skills & education can work ANYWHERE.

Just as we don't have enough badly working laws 
1959 2018-06-27 18:36:53 I remember that and I agree with you that it does not anymore. Too many used this trick to scam investors, then crypto fever is gone and some others probably understood that blockchain is a great technology but is no way related to a company valuation.

1979 2018-06-27 18:33:52 Interesting that the most vulnerable part of the supply chain is the fiat conversion. One wonders how many links in the black market are being slowly driven out of trading in USD and into dealing in crypto directly? Seems safer.

2027 2018-06-27 18:28:08 In other words, I’ve long felt that tx represent demand and active participation in a network so any exchange shuffling will be a part of those numbers for every crypto. 

What’s important is it this is truly not an exchange and is somehow unique to Ethereum.

2067 2018-06-27 18:22:27 I hear ya. I’m in USDT begging for a position to take, and nothing. :( 
I believe in the project soooo much but need a reason to not lose money too. Waiting for confirmation of next BTC impulse to have a counter move for ICX and keep the money coming in despite bear conditions.

2070 2018-06-27 18:21:47 I want my $PCN back f Daps.  Even if I get an airdrop in Q4 I still lost 6 months of staking rewards and 1/3 of my liquidity.

2074 2018-06-27 18:21:10 Things were different when I left, but I can imagine that black MEN are just as rare there as we are here lol. I pcs'd to Virginia (confederate capital) & experienced major culture shock after coming back to the US. Like your uncle I though "damn I shouldn't have come  back."

2079 2018-06-27 18:20:29 Being new into crypto (about 4 months) I’m happy this $pcn debacle happened now instead of a year or 2down the road when I had more skin in the game. A $500 lesson is easier to accept than a $5000 one $daps There’s $$ to be made in #altcoins if you play it right. Take profits!!
2080 2018-06-27 18:20:26 His rollback and even chargeback ideas really piss me off and have no place in crypto.
Secure your system and no rollbacks are needed. 
The issue with chargebacks is even worst, since chargebacks enable 1st party fraud in order to prevent 3rd party fraud!

2108 2018-06-27 18:15:32 The biggest problem is most crypto projects will die, because everyday adaption is mute. Without people using the Sub platform, we are doomed. I like the Sub project. I hope the team figures out a way to solve the problem. You dont want to end up like Oyster Pear.

2114 2018-06-27 18:14:45 The more I look into Layer 2 scaling, the more convinced I am that crypto is going to make it.
2115 2018-06-27 18:14:34 $MCO is the torch light in my Blockfolio today! @monaco_card I still think this will help with the main stream adoption of crypto in the long term

2119 2018-06-27 18:14:07 Yes, they have mine as well. However, I use Overstock and companies who accept crypto and Shift Debit Card when that’s not possible. Just my small contribution, toward mass adoption of the technology & our investments.

2123 2018-06-27 18:13:37 You're correct. 1:1 swap for balances as of yesterday, a yet-to-be-determined airdrop ratio. I wouldn't want to guess what that ratio will be but I know some people are scooping up more cheapies, no matter what the ratio is
2124 2018-06-27 18:13:27 The West owns the lion’s share of wealth; it is the critical area if bitcoin and crypto are to grow in value. Good luck to you promoting EOS, but I see its money potential as very low compared to bitcoin.
2125 2018-06-27 18:13:24 If they had anything about them, they would have had a clause written in the contract about being the only crypto that can be used on the site. That would be at the top of my requirements if I were paying 75M.
2126 2018-06-27 18:13:20 So, what are your buying range and stoping range? And if the count is completed, where is the next count heading?
2127 2018-06-27 18:13:19 It's a really cool concept, kill ppl get paid in crypto... But yea let me know what is good and not so good lol
2128 2018-06-27 18:13:16 Presuming @DAPScoin isn't a scam, why did they ever think cancelling the 1:1 swap from $PCN to $DAPS was a good idea if the solution they have come up with now was always possible? Investors interests must always come first, without a community a project is nothing
2129 2018-06-27 18:13:07 A lot of alts (QTUM yesterday, XMR lately, REQ, RDN, ZEN) are creating green spykes in their charts, usually between +15-20% from bottom. The more this behaviour gets contagious all over #crypto markets, the sooner we'll see some sort of $BTC run. The tide is changing.

2134 2018-06-27 18:12:37 @dominos in addition to accepting #crypto. Your two guys at the Woodland Park, NJ store were phenomenal.  David and Xavier were exceptional in filling out a mega order by themselves.  This is my 6th mega order with this franchise and it has always been great.
2135 2018-06-27 18:12:36 @Skeincoin
2136 2018-06-27 18:12:30 That’s a good point. There’s huge speculative reasons to take a position right now. The Facebook rumor is another example. Personally, whatever it is, it’s clear it’s a supply and demand thing that is exposing what this market needs fundamentally and how much it actually has.

2207 2018-06-27 18:02:38 So if #ICX pumps that means there’s enough retail buyers analogously to push #BTC back to retest $6300. This is a real possibility. Hence my chart from this morning. $btc #btcupdate
2208 2018-06-27 18:02:21 I agree. College definitely has its perks if you have a well thought out plan! I just happened to fall under the list of, "Do this because society says you should." I wouldn't mind going to school for psychology. After crypto makes me millions that is...
2209 2018-06-27 18:01:59 would zucc pivot to crypto for ~75 billion?

2221 2018-06-27 17:59:45 But the idea it self is not new!, there is a lot of other social media and virtual reality that is selling crypto currency, the real question would they allow to exchange it for commodities?
2222 2018-06-27 17:59:35 @etherscan hey I work for Morpheus Network and we have an emergency with multiple fraudulent smart contract addresses being posted. Please contact me so we can avoid people from being scammed
2223 2018-06-27 17:59:06 I wonder what platform they are using to process crypto payments...
2224 2018-06-27 17:58:55 Remember when everyone thought they were money savvy entrepreneurs because of the crypto currency surge. Lol still broke arent you ??
2225 2018-06-27 17:58:55 But how can you mine 'Crypto-Coal' effectively without Blockchain?
2226 2018-06-27 17:58:50 
2227 2018-06-27 17:58:22 I getcha ;) This crypto stuff is nothing if not a rollercoaster like study of pack behaviour and shifting sentiment. I'd love to see someone chart the various 'packs' and their sentiment. Like the XRP crew vs the TRX crew vs the maximalists Etc Etc

2251 2018-06-27 17:55:03 Rbi circular says all regulated entities to cut ties with any organisation/individuals dealing in cryptos. So if i sell my coins on P2P, i get credit 2 my bank a/c. This i declare in my tax returns. IT informs RBI. RBI slap me notice 2 close my account as im dealing in crypto

2254 2018-06-27 17:54:18 I believe we are in the very early stages of crypto and I think things will be a little bit complicated until it becomes Mass adopted then I’m sure it will be a lot simpler
2255 2018-06-27 17:54:02 Indian crypto exchange @koinexindia and @WazirXIndia ended up creating their own p2p service which no central banks can stop. Great and bold move. Truly said, its a revolution and govt can't stop it.

2256 2018-06-27 17:53:52 nothing is more private than paper money; we must hold on to it as lang as possible and fight to keep its existance; if we are forced to use crypto in combo with  smart contracts we lose a core element of freedom
2257 2018-06-27 17:53:46 So I figured new investors would be on the same boat. And most importantly, even if they did dump on us looks like DAPS is still in it for the long run and this last month they were on fire. So we’ll see.
2258 2018-06-27 17:53:45 How does that statement negate my thought? Shows me verge wasn't what pornhub was expecting

2262 2018-06-27 17:52:42 Yeah I was scared but once I saw a price I was comfortable with I just went for it. If i lose the money I lose it but like you said. When I started last November I had no idea about all the bad news and shady stuff coins did before I got in (XVG, XRP, TRX, HTML)

2266 2018-06-27 17:51:55 Scooping up a big bag of alts and riding for the short term is a good play. But you would be crazy to not have a majority of your portfolio in $BTC in case this thing pops alot quicker than you think.  Remember my friends. We went from 7k to 20k in 3 weeks.

2269 2018-06-27 17:51:16 Kinda loses its crypto feel without the coin. I think you called it with coinface :)
2270 2018-06-27 17:51:12 Around $4400: strong historical support + 0.786 fib retracement of the whole parabolic uptrend from $198 to 19900 + 100% corrective wave extention.

2276 2018-06-27 17:49:57 These rumours and articles of Facebook attempting to acquire @Coinbase are absolutely ridiculous.

2283 2018-06-27 17:48:55 My own little theory that I’ve been using to make sense of things is if you factor in the crypto market cap as part of the NASDAQ’s market cap, the Nasdaq never made it back into the channel, & looks a lot more like the SP and Dow. Collectively get a better read on sentiment. JMO
2284 2018-06-27 17:48:48 Facebook reverses their crypto ad ban.. They have a core team evaluating the blockchain space and they would probably acquire a crypto exchange considering it has a lot of KYC details compared to what's required for registering on FB!

2288 2018-06-27 17:48:15 Yeah I dumped them years ago when they rearranged the incoming transactions from time they came in to amount so they could make $$$ on overdraft fees went exclusively to credit unions from there.
2289 2018-06-27 17:48:11 Vitalik doesn't want it to be a patented novel invention which is of course different from it actually being the case.  I find this to be one of the most common mistakes on Twitter where people are especially quick to post emotionally.

2291 2018-06-27 17:48:05 In China right now & its hard to get on Twitter but.....holy shit. For how much we talk about cryptoassets as a global asset, it certainly does not feel that way. This is basically a parallel crypto universe with little/ no bridge in between. 1/

2297 2018-06-27 17:47:31 Total ompliance in crypto is cutting off your nose to spite your face.

The level of censorship and surveillance they do on top of being hostile to Bitcoin is the reason I don't use them and urge everyone I know to stay away from them.
2298 2018-06-27 17:46:58 Lol this guy attacked me and got all his goons to quote how much car salesmen make.. and I was like bruh, this whole thread you didn't even talk about crypto ONCE.

Then he delet the thread.

2299 2018-06-27 17:46:52 Gold is a rare naturally occurring raw material.  Bitcoin is a product formed as the solution to centuries of economic, geographical, and political problems.  Both are desirable, but not comparable.

2323 2018-06-27 17:45:02 Vitalik is not a specialized patent attorney. Therefore, he should reserve judgement. If he had an attorney that is qualified to fully interpret this patent, they would come to the conclusion that this invention is novel and fully warranted.

2342 2018-06-27 17:42:45 if you want to do that with your crypto ..... just go to $nexo . they will help you out with that;)
2343 2018-06-27 17:42:42 WOW, now that is a gangster move. That was my FIRST thought when I saw this giant discount, but I chickened out. That's the smart play though. You're right, all kinds of drama has gone on in many projects and eventually becomes old news while you get stinking rich.
2344 2018-06-27 17:42:36 I’m excited!!!

2348 2018-06-27 17:42:24 Women are 50% of our population.  Without women, crypto can not have mass adoption.  That is a no brainer.  You guys are trailblazers and warriors leading the way for future girls to follow.  I have a 12 year old daughter and I see a bright future for her in crypto.

2350 2018-06-27 17:42:12 Someone argued to me that PoW miners have more of an ability to crash the market than PoS block forgers....
2351 2018-06-27 17:42:09 It's irresponsible for a cryptocurrency organization to allocate funds to bribing exchanges to list them instead of using those funds on r&d which would make the crypto useful and secure enough to be listed on an exchange.

Yes, I'm talking about you @Ripple.

2353 2018-06-27 17:41:50 Thanks, I do, & yes I take into account that it's all a psychological game albeit w/real losers in the end. To quote exactly what I said, it was what happened to #AltonSterling that pushed me over the edge. The others were all awful but that one sticks out the most. Thanks again.

2355 2018-06-27 17:41:43 #crypto is the biggest hedge against big bureacracy. plain and simply, if you are a CS student at an Ivy League school, immersed in logic, and you see people on the world's stage acting insanely, you think to yourself, "how can I promote a world governed more by coded principle?"

2370 2018-06-27 17:39:51 I posted a BTC chart a couple days ago and it continues to show about where BTC is at. It needs to close at around $6200 to continue to stay in the flag and above support. Where it’s at now is still signaling a break down.

2389 2018-06-27 17:38:20 Thanks for the clarification. Unfortunately the negativity & toxic nature of crypto is getting worse, so it's nice when a team keeps things positive. TPay has been brutal for slandering any other small cap coin/POS coin lately.

2465 2018-06-27 17:31:06 Their advertisement revenue must not be to the liking to the board and investors.  And/or they're making up revenue lost to the Cambridge Analytica scandal. But good for crypto in general to reach the masses more.
2466 2018-06-27 17:31:00 You mean "faith"? For sure. Faith is the strongest spice I cook with (Long term crypto hodler). However, my point is that Revoluts crypto service is deceptive. But I do like their fiat services.

2493 2018-06-27 17:28:29 Playing the low cap game brings more risk to the table than the "usual" crypto risk

I play low caps, and accept that risk and potential outcome

I never played $SUMO though, because of that insane premine on top of a nothing-special Monero fork. Major FA red flags from day one
2494 2018-06-27 17:28:29 What's your sense of who's buying them? I don't get it. Crypto people trying to broaden their asset class?

2508 2018-06-27 17:26:24 Back then, Crypto Twitter sentiment was easy to gauge. Now there's a lot of you, even more outside Twitter. I don't think even polls are mildly accurate anymore.
2509 2018-06-27 17:26:12 If you don’t believe in it, definitely don’t buy it. Only invest in what you believe in. But also don’t cry about it when it does a 10 X. Own your decision whether they’re good ones or not.

2511 2018-06-27 17:25:42 That’s right. There are two parts to any idea - building & execution. The second is often very tricky and even more so in the crypto world. I am rooting for their successful launch on July 9!

2515 2018-06-27 17:25:24 You’re hanging with the wrong crypto crowd then. My twittersphere has plenty of inclusive crypto peers
2516 2018-06-27 17:25:23 What a cool forum. Wish I could go. Best argument is economic. I had to wire $150k to a vendor in another country and exchange spread and fees were many thousands vs. hundreds. Banks are soaking us with fees plus took days. Crypto is more than money it’s freedom.

2607 2018-06-27 17:14:47 Rolling your own crypto is like building your own fireworks. Experts can use standard components and follow the rules and maybe make it work. Do it wrong and you'll blow your arms off. And it's always safer to buy premade off-the-shelf.

2611 2018-06-27 17:14:35 As someone whose accurately predicted economic crashes throughout my life - and predicted the crypto crash at the start of the yr to the week - you are misreading his benefit to you economically. Your cost of living is rising. Imports cost more. Factories and stores will close.
2612 2018-06-27 17:14:31 I forgot to add... Justin sun actually has the words scam hidden in his name... it’s the truth... they are making the 3rd national treasure movie where they discover the true city of crypto gold and j sun is the new net god of copy and paste

2618 2018-06-27 17:14:12 fyi I don't hate anyone's hustle, god bless. But when you have zero skills and zero experience, don't pretend to be an investment banker and give financial advice to people just starting out in crypto. They don't know any better. Be fucking responsible w the advice you give.

2620 2018-06-27 17:13:54 Bence çok ta tepki koyulacak bir konu değil . Deepweb te bitcoin ile silah alınıyor. O  zaman  BTC de  almayalim. Tepki koyacaksak herşey crypto dünyasına hiç bulasamayiz
2621 2018-06-27 17:13:53 $BTC dominance %42'yi aşmış. Dominance grafiğine gelecek bir düzeltme ile altcoinlere biraz can suyu verebilirler. Piyasa kafasını kaldırdığı gibi herhangi bir altcoinden almak lazım.
2622 2018-06-27 17:13:53 Gold is physically difficult to transfer, and it's not freely moved out of a country where it imposes capital control. On top of this, gold owners may worry that their gold may be robbed on streets.
BTC fills the gaps perfectly.

2626 2018-06-27 17:13:34 For real. Seems like the only use case we have fro for crypto is to purchase a product that nobody actually buys. I am actually bearish long term on actual crypto"currencies" that offer bothing but a medium of exchange.

2635 2018-06-27 17:12:52 Simple one of the many application - Share electricity with the neighbors
The MicroGrid  project in New York’s Brooklyn allowed the households to buy/sell energy via smart contracts on the #Ethereum #blockchain.  #cryptocurrency #Crypto
2636 2018-06-27 17:12:48 Turns out the old dev didn't agree to the new rebranding and restructing. New team claims that he wasn't a part of it so was really surprised to see that all play down. The project looked really promising too
2637 2018-06-27 17:12:47 Didn't they sell most of it last year when $ETH was like 160 usd?
2638 2018-06-27 17:12:32 Ok now we are getting somewhere... @soulgamersNET im in crypto for some time.
@ItsNancy81 i didnt say nothing about that u made money. Point was that these vgo is useless without gambling.
2639 2018-06-27 17:12:26 Yep, that's a valid concern, it's also a source of confusion for crypto apps where the value flows of the crypto app gets put in the box for "in-app purchases".
2640 2018-06-27 17:12:16 I voted for Obama twice. Didn't tell friends & family since a majority are hardcore Republicans. After seeing the division on his 2nd term, weak negotiations, scandals & and seeing the hate from unhinged dems and media from 2016 to Now, I decided to #WalkAway from the Dem Party.
2641 2018-06-27 17:11:59 hola
2642 2018-06-27 17:11:51 Wahahahahaa !
2643 2018-06-27 17:11:48 For sure
2644 2018-06-27 17:11:44 Remember... creative inventors have solution minds. If they want crypto to work it will. You cannot beat it they will find a way. It’s that simple. These minds are built different and love to “THINK” - saying crypto is dead is silly and death for crypto is temporary. Respawn god!
2645 2018-06-27 17:11:33 $DXY 95'i aştı ama TL güçlü duruyor. Satış baskısı var. Çeşitli bahenelerle büyük yolculuk öncesi 4.10-4.40 arası gelir mi?

2647 2018-06-27 17:10:56 Hmm I wonder if the Facebook crypto ban was all strategic planning. Possibly either to help Zuck buy the dip, maybe Zuck wanted coinbase to pay put a nice chunk to advertise? You cant say there wasnt something behind the scenes here.
2648 2018-06-27 17:10:45 Fiar thought. Market is just too small still imo.

2672 2018-06-27 17:07:13 One the most valuable things all newbies with low bankroll need to know is you can use Coinbase to acquire your crypto.

2678 2018-06-27 17:06:21 You seem to be equivocating 'centralized'. The LN itself is not centralized, the fact that some nodes will have more activity than others is obvious but not that much of a concern, as long as the underlining protocol holds to decentralization as a core principle. It does.

2712 2018-06-27 17:02:28 Recent history tells us that $EOS is one of the first larger cap alts to start trending at the beginning of an alt cycle.

It's moving up nicely today but still too early to make the call. If we see $EOS break above 137-138k Sats with some conviction I reckon it's on.

2742 2018-06-27 16:59:50 How is this any different from any other whale? 

These teams already have enough fiat funds for their roadmaps so they are no different than any other crypto whales. Are you tracking BTC whales too?
2743 2018-06-27 16:59:41 It's a respectable career path tbh, I was more referring to it from the angle that i'd be getting paid in crypto 
2744 2018-06-27 16:59:40 I'm not sure what you mean., PCN is not worth zero. If you owned PCN as of yesterday, it will be still be swapped with DAPS 1:1. If you buy more cheap PCN (not saying I will be doing that, I'm happy enough), you will be airdropped more DAPS.
2745 2018-06-27 16:59:23 The tremendous project development, I'm sure this project will be successful because it sees a great and very active team, #MPCXP #Cryptocurrency #blockchain #token #crypto #Airdrop

2747 2018-06-27 16:59:12 I know it's painful if you've been forced holding or being disciplined with patience on your #crypto portfolio the past 6 months. 

Talk to someone who at the same time last year was holding $BTC #bitcoin at 2000-2700 how they felt by December. 

#patience pays off big!

2749 2018-06-27 16:59:01 I’ve heard of private bankers warning people to stay away from Crypto. “Who is going to take the tokens of your hands if the governments ban it” So 2013....

2836 2018-06-27 16:49:08 I would assume that they want recipients to be exposed to cryptocurrency directly. Going through a regular charity would most likely involve a crypto -> fiat conversion. That kills the "banking the unbanked" side effect of having a crypto wallet on a phone.

2841 2018-06-27 16:48:38 All humble feelings aside. I have my own crypto currency. It is actively being traded on russias #1 stock exchange. It now has official USD value & is a top 20 asset pair with $WAVES. I want everyone to feel the energy and focus I do right now $GGCash 
2842 2018-06-27 16:48:28 Toutes ces monnaies n’auront jamais de valeur de pure shitcoin et des #exitscam en devenir. C’est triste mais l’éducation des gens doit continuer
2843 2018-06-27 16:48:27 They evolve and become more decentralized over time. Every crypto network needs a team behind it to get it off the ground. That team is doing regular startup activities like ongoing product dev, marketing, BD, etc. until the network can sustain itself.
2844 2018-06-27 16:48:23 C'est quoi ce truc ?
2845 2018-06-27 16:48:19 Would be interested to hear your thoughts on #Skeincoin #skc
2846 2018-06-27 16:48:13 International survey carried out by Dutch bank @ING, finds that #cryptocurrency ownership is expected to double in Europe and the United States.

This is just the speculative retail market. Assets like $XRP are also getting utility value.

Hope you didn't sell the bottom

2847 2018-06-27 16:48:13 Google missed most of the social media rush. I don't think @alphabetincUS will want to miss the crypto rush. Alphabet might surprise us with proof of serious skin in the crypto game by end of year
2848 2018-06-27 16:48:04 Been a crazy day. I woke up, everyone was all "Sell your PCN immediately, the swap with DAPS has been cancelled".....now it's NOT cancelled. Still, I could've done without that drama!
2849 2018-06-27 16:47:56 #cryptovalley companies like @BitcoinSuisseAG and Crypto Storage AG are working on this, but I like @CasaHODL 3-5 multi-sig. Yet, any centralised solution (i.e. owner/company keeps keys) is prone to Rubber-hose cryptanalysis. @ricburton thoughts on decentralised alternatives?
2850 2018-06-27 16:47:50 @PMOIndia @RBI @FinMinIndia @arunjaitley 

Why there is still so many cloud over Crypto Currency handling and clear cut guidelines not drafted yet on trading/usage of Crypto currencies. Either you should allow or ban, make it clear in best of the public interest immediately.
2851 2018-06-27 16:47:44 that’s awesome! At @Eth2io we made same mission to help people with crypto-onboarding and p2p transfers by phone number. Our solution can be very helpful in this area

2854 2018-06-27 16:47:26 I think it has more to do with FB looking at their books and saying that crypto revenue was good, let’s bring that back.
2855 2018-06-27 16:47:00 Also true. LN rates will be distinct from exchange lending rates. Both relevant and both paint a picture.
2856 2018-06-27 16:46:56 They're allowing them into the country? Wow I know two love birds who must be upset about that smh.
2857 2018-06-27 16:46:43 And gold, silver, foreign stocks, and crypto continue to go down. & the US dollar is getting stronger?
2858 2018-06-27 16:46:32 I just confuse her with crypto slang  and she usually just gives up.

2864 2018-06-27 16:46:07 This is true. My point is that cold storage bitcoin has a rate of zero. Exchange lending is bitcoin not in your custody. Important to differentiate.
2865 2018-06-27 16:45:59 I presume within the next 3 months. Facebook preparing to allow crypto in some capacity. Maybe through coinbase charity.

2872 2018-06-27 16:45:19 Spots for the premium group for  JULY are now OPEN!! Crypto most likely close to the bottom now and I expect to begin another bullrun after the past couple of months. 

As I have shared, the premium group has continued to make money in this bear market with great margin plays!

2986 2018-06-27 16:33:23 With all the damage facebook has done (privacy issues etc) I don't think a Crypto would have any impact. However owning an exchange may be a winning ticket for them. I'm not sure if I'd like them dabbling in this space but it would bring alot of attention to #crypto

3001 2018-06-27 16:31:58 Exactly. Most people prefer the convenience. Knowing that it “just works”. 

It’s the same hurdle crypto will need to get over to ever reach a mass market. Most people are perfectly comfortable using banks and existing payment processors.

3006 2018-06-27 16:31:03 I would stay put for now. That’s what I am doing. I am all in tether. I made a small profit the other day in WAN, I broke even on NEO and I am staying out for now. It’s a no trade zone for me ATM

3013 2018-06-27 16:30:17 I’m just curious if TRX had to shell out any dough for this the way XVG did. If not then I like the move. A use for your coin is always positive imo. Too many crypto coins do nothing at this point.

3025 2018-06-27 16:28:47 Speaking of europeans, 9% seems to be very very overvalued. I would guess less than 1% would be more accurate, around 0.1% is my estimation (no proof anyway). Hardly anybody understand or talk about crypto, except computer geeks/nerds/speculators.
3026 2018-06-27 16:28:36 Feels same to $crypto right now. What a mess.
3027 2018-06-27 16:28:10 Banks suck. Buy more crypto.

1) Locked my Merrill Lynch acc
2) Froze my cc's
3) Confiscated 750k in my BoA Acc
4) Held my $ for 2 months w/ no info
5) Banned me from BoA

3051 2018-06-27 16:25:51 What does everyone need to know about Bitcoin and the crypto market right now that might provide hope? Who is forming partnerships with who? Mainnet launches?

3274 2018-06-27 15:59:33 In terms of crypto trading, it becomes more difficult working with larger sums of money because of liquidity and fees issues.
3275 2018-06-27 15:59:30 Doing the opposite worked for me with the stock market over the past 10 years.  I will be using that as a strategy for crypto as well!  
3276 2018-06-27 15:59:29 Kringles are the smallest change of the crypto-currency TBC.  

0.00000001 TBC = 1 Kringle.  

The way you can calculate the conversion of Kringles into TBC is by dividing the Kringles by 100,000,000 to get the TBC equivalent.  100,000 Kringles divided by 100,000,000 = 0.001 TBC.

3286 2018-06-27 15:58:39 @RevolutApp is doing a similar job in Europe. 
I'd say @AbraGlobal is my favorite so far.
@metalpaysme is doing the same job from a crypto angle.
Weirdly enough none of those guys provided a user friendly solution.

3293 2018-06-27 15:57:37 I compare #crypto to 2005-2009 in US stock market/housing market. As young kid out of college, I bought a house because everyone told me prices keep going up, if I don't buy now I will never be able to afford. So I bought. Two years later, house was worth 40% of what I paid.

No real crypto giant
Coinbase CEO stated ambition to reach 1 billion users

3331 2018-06-27 15:52:45 facebook buying coinbase would be a boss move by Zuckerberg, especially since Winklevoss twins own Gemini. you know there success in crypto has to bother him just as a competitive guy.

Accurate Swing trading signals are hard to come by when price is so close to support like this. It’s time to take out your scalpel.

3543 2018-06-27 15:28:34 going to start looking more closely at #crypto stocks once $btcusd trades below $5k (bottom fish) or above $8k (new bull trend)... anything inside that range is total uncertainty imo

So many people have been burned and lost alot of money after what was announced by the #pcn team. Always do your own research folks, stay safe in crypto land

3554 2018-06-27 15:27:05 Zuck needs to make a big move. FB is slowly dying .. this would def bring the world together. Something @facebook originally set out to do. Just imagine being able to move crypto around via FB and Insta .. oh man.

3559 2018-06-27 15:26:30 Some crypto's have lobbied to be the social currency of FB. Look, I dislike the constant political and food pics on Facebook but if they are going to get into the cryptocurrency game they will own something. 
 A.) They have the $
 B.) TOO MUCH MONEY TO BE MADE FOR THEM NOT TO

3563 2018-06-27 15:25:47 I like everything except the word minorities. It's a perversion of the original term used to describe numbers. The use now has much more to do with the root word, minor meaning less than or child like. Mostly wish people of color would stop using it.

3568 2018-06-27 15:25:04 I have my reservation about using crypto currency. Who holds, where it holds, decentralised , no accountability , no regulation or standards that it follows? Of course Facebook will do anything to make money. Selling personal data, now darkweb money.

3575 2018-06-27 15:24:35 Perhaps that was the reason for the ‘temporary’ ban. The crypto ban for crypto has also been lifted from Facebook.

3617 2018-06-27 15:19:26 IMO It is important to keep track of laws from the countries we reside on. Brasil sucks tax-wise for many reasons but for crypto trading its paradise. If that wasn't the case I'd consider living somewhere else or doing something else instead of risking prosecution.

@Bitmillex_ICO
3676 2018-06-27 15:13:53 It's like when an exchange delist a shitcoin and it spikes right before the delisting.
3677 2018-06-27 15:13:44 It is very possible. It may look crazy but this is an asset which went from 1k to 20k in a year without any crazy fundamental changes so it may as well go back to 1-3k .
3678 2018-06-27 15:13:43 That plus taxes and borrowing - governments are propped up on three legs, but printing money is the most corrupt (and that is saying something when taxes and borrowing are the two "honest" ways of generating revenue).  Let's see crypto take out that most corrupt leg!

3778 2018-06-27 15:03:57 That sucks. The absence of restrictive regs on a lot of stuff is one think I dig about life here. Sadly, the state is sticking its nose in more and more and crippling these companies providing excellent services. Dealing with this myself with a crypto exchange at present.

3821 2018-06-27 14:59:39 Twitter is just not the right medium for posting relevant intraday trades, where the money is made. Discord is better. I will refrain calling anything close to intraday here - only trading adagios or zen teachings to help traders out with their wrecked morale and psyche. #bitcoin
3822 2018-06-27 14:59:09 Crap like this takes away confidence from crypto & smaller companies.
Why should anyone trust you after this? 
You didn't have new information to cancel the swap in the first place. Either you are genius scammers or incredibly stupid & unprepared.

3830 2018-06-27 14:58:07 I lost a bit in @DAPScoin today.

Not anywhere near as much as some. this is crypto and this can sometimes never be avoided.

I put my losses back into Linda and 6hours later recouped half already. 

Don’t be fooled with a promised Airdrop. Buy $linda and forget #ripdaps
3831 2018-06-27 14:58:03 Funny. They throw me out of the telegram channel at #verge $xvg after i mentioned the rumors about tron and pornhub.

3840 2018-06-27 14:56:07 @XRP_Scheetz You know what.  It is a good idea!  The problem now with crypto's is that people are afraid to use their coins as it might gain in value and lose their potential profit.  It is actually a negative effect as people would rather HODL than use it.  1/3

3884 2018-06-27 14:48:38 I agree TV is not a good medium to talk about the intricacies of crypto. For the most part, they want the sensational good or the sensational bad, both of which are half truths, and if you try and go into depth you often get cut off bc it’s “boring.”

3907 2018-06-27 14:45:44 Many who have jumped into #crypto investing are driven by the #FOMA, and this my friends is the recipe for disaster!
3908 2018-06-27 14:45:40 Dislike treasuries, but that's a personal thing.
Low risk: Cash (aka actual cash), Bank balance
Medium risk: Stocks + ETFs (phasing out individual stock picks currently)
High risk: Crypto + Private stock
Should be a bit more risk averse, but still a lifetime to work, if it fails.

4095 2018-06-27 14:25:06 Anything less than a billion is small change in crypto. ;)
4096 2018-06-27 14:25:05 I agree Rex - #xrp is a long-term play, even among cryptocurrencies.  Ripple is working on the banks and FIs.  Coil is working on micropayments.  I see this as complimentary and very exciting when it comes to upside potential of #xrpthestandard.  Thanks for tweeting!

4101 2018-06-27 14:24:33 Results aren’t surprising since crypto attracts a certain type of person.
4102 2018-06-27 14:24:32 its been moving sideways since you left, but I'm expecting 2019 to be a big year fro crypto.
4103 2018-06-27 14:24:30 Great point. Could FB's #blockchain team use the ads as leverage? Partner with our blockchain program/list our #crypto on your exchange and we'll approve you to advertise. Although FB could very well be building an internal private blockchain for their own use not a public token.
4104 2018-06-27 14:24:27 FCoinは伸びると勝手に確信めいた考えを持ってるけど、少し前に $FT は一旦同値撤退してる。

4110 2018-06-27 14:23:43 Wasn’t commenting on @cburniske actual investment strategy, just have issues with blandly propping crypto to the mainstream as part of the frenzy without warning or calling out charlatan practices live, and yeah it’s too prevalent in the space as is.
4111 2018-06-27 14:23:35 50k btc is possible. More than that  would be just better :)

4121 2018-06-27 14:22:34 What this chart shows is that debt increases as the govt spends money on a war. Debt then goes down after the war is over. The problem now is we’ve ended two wars and debt/GDP is project to keep increasing due to the baby boomers leaving the workforce and drawing their benefits.
4122 2018-06-27 14:22:31 なんか、投資、トレードは人生みたい。

最後は成功者として笑ってる。

4154 2018-06-27 14:19:00 Crypt ads should NOT be banned. For example, what is wrong if a retail site (for example Etsy, or whatever) advertises and says "we now accept crypto payments"?  Crypto ads are good especially for online shopping sites.

4241 2018-06-27 14:10:19 I think you're manipulating the situation a bit here and acting like a baby. Im talking about $CPX which has nothing to do with $PCN. I got burned on pcn like everyone else did.   This is crypto.  Shit happens all the time.  I was saying I was a buyer because it was cheap.
4242 2018-06-27 14:10:18 $gin ...nothing else compares

4244 2018-06-27 14:10:06 I don't get it JW, you said that you're not buying at these levels coz you made your mind when you bought (aside of the successful trade that you did), I think dollar averaging is the way to go in crypto and that's why I don't get why would you do a investing seminar...
4245 2018-06-27 14:10:05 I'd say all post abrahamic religions are totalitarian and centralised in nature.
4246 2018-06-27 14:10:03  is it now...
4247 2018-06-27 14:09:54 As the rest of the crypto twitter is anti freedom of Speech, I’ll be the first to start.

$xp - and any other gamers related coins low caps or otherwise are good crypto to invest in. 

Started researching $mobi, looks interesting, decent marketing coupled with working dApp Store.

4251 2018-06-27 14:09:35 It's hardly Democratic when everyone must follow the 10 commandments. The notion of a monotheistism is centralised. And the model where churches extort money is used by most governments.
4252 2018-06-27 14:09:17 Tell him a year ago bitcoin was around 2500. and now around 6000. Also the market cap has more than doubled in Crypto, so those are the facts and if he can’t add then yes, it’s dead to him only!
4253 2018-06-27 14:09:09 そーいや、先週ホットヨガした時のインストラクター、下腹ぽっこりだった。説得力無いんだよなー。ヨガの先生には、ブラトップとレギンスで腹出してやってほしいっす。
4254 2018-06-27 14:08:57 ビットクラブのシミュレーション：
1シェアー当たりの採掘量は，これまで一定値で近似できましたが，9月15日から減って来ています。2018-01現在は以前の1/6ぐらいに。採掘量の変動を考慮した形に改良してみてその減少ぶりにびっくり。
