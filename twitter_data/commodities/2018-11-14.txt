You can't place emotion over reason when the labor and commodities of others are in play.

46 2018-11-14 21:44:08 Pessoas são produto de exportação? São commodities? Faz favor...
47 2018-11-14 21:40:00 This is what happens when you put a lid on a commodity not related to supply/demand. This used to somewhat normal market action before the HFT war on commodities. Get ready for more of this in the future on other commodities that have been suppressed. Lot of E&P's have been hurt.
48 2018-11-14 21:33:11 Governo Lula pegou a casa arrumada pelo senhor FHC, com as reformas estruturais na educação e com a valorização das commodities. Para ministro da econômia nomeou um PSDBISTA que tomou medidas de sucesso e negou as medidas inicialmente proposta pelo PT.
49 2018-11-14 21:32:44 I tried using Overcast for the past weeks and I’ve had nothing but frustrations. Poor archaic UX behind Castro and PC, weird UI glitches, and poor performance in some areas. I don’t even notice any improvements in audio, voice boost and silence trimming are commodities now.
50 2018-11-14 21:27:03 That’s what you get when half of all health care spending is government spending - prices are determined politically instead of by the free choices of individuals, which is what keeps more important commodities like food affordable.

54 2018-11-14 21:12:54 Btw, have u updated yourself with an understanding of how commodities are priced & how the global commodities markets work? Even in a mighty economy like China or the US? Yes or no?
55 2018-11-14 21:11:47 Many talking about an imminent fed pause—some conditions/signs we need to see before that occurs: a)fed governors publicly talking down the economy, especially wrt 2% inflation target and labor mkt trends; b)USD correction lower and commodities and precious metals higher....
56 2018-11-14 21:07:40 Lots of selling today but it was very orderly. Contained quite nicely. No panicking. I still think we are correcting a making a major rotation into commodities. Its like turning around a huge boat. Out of tech and into last part of bull cycle plays.Takes time but we are spinning.
57 2018-11-14 21:02:51 Commodities: #Natural gas +17.51%, #Lumber +14.86%
Top commodity gainers are Natural gas (17.51%), Lumber (14.86%) and Heating oil (2.23%). Biggest losers are Palm Oil (-3.62%), Coal (-2.86%) and Cocoa (-2.49%).
58 2018-11-14 20:51:55 A whopping 94 percent of farm support under the Farm Bill goes to only six commodities: corn, wheat, soy, cotton, rice, and peanuts. Interesting is that these six commodities only account for 28 percent of agricultural production in the U.S.

60 2018-11-14 20:44:40 What broke in the #NatGas #LNG sector overnight? because the #US market #commodities shows a jump of 18.39% at the moment!! That is a large rise in price.
61 2018-11-14 20:33:20 Oil & Gas commodities price per gal are down, considerably, $60 per barrel. The real problem are states like California where actual tax on gas is closer to 73.82 cents per gallon, depending on where you fill up and the price of gas at the time.
62 2018-11-14 20:32:13 It’s a cross to be lonely or infertile or both - but people are not commodities as society wants us to believe - and there are lots of people who need our love and connection even if they aren’t family. I tried to remember those things when I felt at my lowest while infertile.
63 2018-11-14 20:28:35 Agreed.... But aren’t all equities, commodities and crypto’s similar to gambling?
64 2018-11-14 20:21:55 Funny. As an ex forex trader that went into oil, commodities and sovereign PR im the opposite. I like a bit of grime, the odd drill bit hanging around, plenty of bad language etc. Point is each to their own, we are all different #powerandinfluence

98 2018-11-14 17:56:14 But that doesn't work either, if only because because you can't have a functioning commodities market if you can't buy/sell blind with confidence.
99 2018-11-14 17:56:11 You still see tons of crypto investors on the TL hyping up different names or commodities plays.

107 2018-11-14 17:27:14 agreed, although we have entered a period where not all currencies trade the same. NZD very interesting expression of this - close today over 6788 would be a new high close for this leg...this despite risk-off in stocks/commodities. 6850 big lvl above.

1. What about 2cr jobs
2. What about Dollar-Rupee
3. what about Price hikes in daily commodities?
4. What about Black Money from Swiss Bank
5. When will we get 15Lakhs.

120 2018-11-14 16:11:19 Crude prices are lagging behind other commodities = wrong
Crude prices are lagging.= correct 

The correct word is actually "lagging", to add "behind" would amount to a totology.

121 2018-11-14 16:10:14 Shame how people, particularly prisoners, are made into commodities. All across the county I (unfortunately) reside are signs that say "Keep our money in Greene County!", referring directly to the prisoners being boarded out to other counties because the jail was deemed
122 2018-11-14 16:08:40 Agreed. Dollar drainage hits home before commods get green light to start sustainable rally. Post a back off of QT.. but Powell no wimp. So could not 2200 and he will continue to respect math. That puts commodities somewhere south of “zero” as all are sold to cover stock margin
123 2018-11-14 16:06:10 Yes sir. I’m flailing in that league and have young cornerstones like Kerryon and Cook. Trying to make deals for more young pieces but sometimes that means giving away proven commodities for less than worth. Still a good deal for both IMO.
124 2018-11-14 16:05:41 OK if you've made your  millions exploiting commodities/ national institutions and stealing money from ordinary citizens. Come on in.

126 2018-11-14 16:04:48 From equities, to commodities, to bonds, markets are extremely volatile right now. 

During times of severe volatility, it is best to make trades with long timeframes and resort back to fundamentals for long term directional clarity.

127 2018-11-14 16:02:59 That's why my response to the GDP-isnt-everything people is usually: ok, let's look at life expectancy, literacy, average hours worked (and prices of many everyday commodities expressed in those hours) etc. too. GDP is a so-so measure, but it turns out to be a rather good proxy.

143 2018-11-14 15:16:12 Yes. That was one i had in mind but I think you could take it further to have a basket of currencies, a basket of commodities, a basket of stocks, a basket of precious metals, and maybe a basket of real estate. Maybe have em all tied together which would bring ultimate stability.
144 2018-11-14 15:14:34 One thing we all need to learn, having grown up in a capitalist, consumer-product driven society with advertising invading every part of our culture, is how to notice when we've tied our personal identity to consumerism and commodities, and KILL THAT TENDENCY, ASAP!

175 2018-11-14 13:52:24 So LTV is a theory of capitalist social relations because what is exchanged it is not merely the commodities but the labors that produce it. Sraffian approach tends to neglect this aspect expressing value and prices as the same thing.
176 2018-11-14 13:47:26 I approach the relation between values and prices within the conceptual pair essence/expression. Value is the basis from which prices can be expressed and can be defined as a social property of the commodities allowing its exchangeability.

238 2018-11-14 09:41:59 No. Because of Trump's policies, China has decided to no longer buy WTI, or any US commodities. Soon it will stop buying our debt, and will unload its holdings.
239 2018-11-14 09:39:47 Do you want to see the invoices on who gave money to whom ? Why didn’t u bother to take physical delivery of commodities? Greed of making money ???

242 2018-11-14 09:29:28 US also has much much higher GDP.  Uhm don't worry, when it blows it will get us all.  But some physical commodities.  Buy some gold and silver, might hold and your family for a while
243 2018-11-14 09:27:36 You just proved yourself arrogant Ruuod.  Buy some commodities.  Deustche is insolvent, you better read their financial papers.  Debt far outstrips assets.  Commonz seems to be sputtering as well. Good luck to you Ruuod, good luck to all of us.  We are the peons dude.

253 2018-11-14 08:47:53 Yes. Commodities, dear sir. Every country will support their language and will have things in their. Product. If you are in Willys, Lidl, most ‘commodities’ would be in Swedish. So if you are confused, just ask. That was the whole point.
254 2018-11-14 08:47:25 @AJStream Access to family planning services in Africa is no doubt very low.

280 2018-11-14 06:26:28 I am neither statistician nor economist, I am just a mum buying groceries, paying for commodities. I am interested in finding out what the contents of the basket are and their relative weights.
281 2018-11-14 06:25:07 I wan educate her. Money na item to pay for commodities. If you use an pay for sex, the receiver becomes a worker for whatever you paid for. In the case of sex, a prostitute. Nothing more nothing else
282 2018-11-14 06:23:50 My dear your argument is flawed, money could never equate sex because money is an item used to pay for commodities and offering it for sex automatically makes the receiver a worker. So the word prostitute.
283 2018-11-14 06:17:57 Given our existing economic model, poverty eradication can't happen. To eradicate poverty at $5 a day, global GDP would have to increase 175x.

285 2018-11-14 06:16:01 Electricity and CPU cycles are commodities
286 2018-11-14 06:15:49 Also most of the inflation is in agro commodities due to mismanagement and lack of liberalisation. Milk is another such example
287 2018-11-14 06:12:39 Unfortunately in California it is illegal to "Sell commodities, household essentials, fuel, etc. after a declared state of emergency for more than 10% over the cost of these items immediately preceding the declaration."

How do you protect yourself for the downturn when you are in commodities business? You buy assets during upturn, go into complimentary business to provide the cushion, you go lean on spending.
289 2018-11-14 05:57:24 #RandomThoughts
Price is largely market driven in primary and secondary economic sectors (commodities). If huge profits are made, it's because of right play in a favourable market. Innovation and branding may give only smaller profits comparatively and incrementally.
290 2018-11-14 05:53:44 I wish more people were asking themselves “why is Donald Trump interfering in Florida’s election process?” Property, money laundering, visa fraud, imports/exports (human as well as other “commodities”)...FL is still pretty mobbed as well w/the RU mob.
291 2018-11-14 05:38:48 Commodities have uses outside of the hallucination we call the economy though. Gold is useful in electronic products, for instance. I don't think it makes sense to lump that in with stocks or crypto. Same with land or real estate.

309 2018-11-14 03:37:58 Thanks for the insightful article. We humans prefer categorizing issues into black and white but the reality is always complex. As the global demand for different commodities is on rise, focus should be drawn on sustainable practices and productivity per land used.

339 2018-11-14 01:23:33 @ctvregina add the price of WCS oil to your commodities segment on news. So we actually see what we get paid in western Canada for our oil
340 2018-11-14 01:20:31 sube el dólar: baja el petróleo, los otros commodities atrás
341 2018-11-14 01:17:20 The only assets you can own are stock, bonds, currency & commodities. Let’s digitize them all! #blockchaintechnology #blockchain #Assets
342 2018-11-14 01:16:39 The rest would come from education. Build up regional higher education in fields like computer science, services, research, materials science, and advanced manufacturing. Using energy exports to negotiate for market access or essential supply-chain commodities will be crucial.
343 2018-11-14 01:14:18 Dont thank me yet!!! They need pain meds, antibiotics, and burn ointment, three things that are going to be prpecious commodities, which is why I reached out to Summit Vet here in the GTA (Toronto) to see if they can help too.
344 2018-11-14 01:02:17 Yup, especially people claim to be familiar with stuff like commodities prices, "price setters" & "price takers"!   
345 2018-11-14 01:02:05 This week is the time to go Whole Hog on Commodities oil copper especially Natural Gas also.
Easy doubles and triples in stocks like CHK, FCX, NOG
In 4-8 months. 
10 Baggers a slam dunk in three to five years by and hold by by by
346 2018-11-14 01:01:23 Ese es @petrogustavo, alguien que quiere un pais de pacotilla, sin industria, productor de commodities y de aguacates, porque eso significa los tlc para Colombia. Me pregunto donde estan los polistas que aconsejaban votar por petro y que teniamos que dar un debate @eduarosorio1
347 2018-11-14 01:00:56 Rubbish! Are u even familiar with the dynamics of palm oil markets & palm oil prices? Please get a seasoned commodities trader like Cargill or Wilmar to educate u! Btw, China is acting like any sensible buyer & is constantly sourcing for the best prices.
348 2018-11-14 00:55:34 Well bcoz it's all fake what with the peso and shares dip, widening trade gap, ballooning foreign debt, still high prices of basic commodities, gas & electricity, heavy traffic, ongoing militarization of wps, rampant drug smuggling, clampdown on critics etc.
349 2018-11-14 00:54:03 He’s such an elitist capitalist gowl, he only sees people as commodities who are either earning for the state, or costing it money
350 2018-11-14 00:48:40 Caso o Brasil não comece a desenvolver a sua indústria, baixando juros e qualificando a mão-de-obra, seremos sempre reféns das commodities. Impactando nossa balança comercial, cambio, arrecadação e consumo.
351 2018-11-14 00:43:27 Stocks, crypto, Realestate, commodities, PM's all going down. Tell me where can one put cash Alex? Feels like we gotta wait out Armageddon and hopefully be prepared.
352 2018-11-14 00:39:16 Despite some ugly history, the human race has amazing potential. The ability to reason, use logic & intellect, deploy empathy & compassion, and to cooperate & thrive. 

As long as capitalism has us objectifying others & fetishizing commodities, this potential will remain dormant.
353 2018-11-14 00:38:25 Commodities prices as of now: 

Spot Gold: 1,203.90
LME Nickel: 11,322.50
Copper: 2.688
Brent Oil: 65.34

USDPHP: 53.06
354 2018-11-14 00:37:09 I agree we need known commodities for the playoffs so we have until the trade deadline and/or the buyout market to figure it out it. We can wait two months to see if Korver is worth it
355 2018-11-14 00:33:18 4 games is still not enough. This team's timeline is very clearly not about waiting and seeing anymore. Those years were fun, but this trade just shut that down. You need known commodities for the playoffs if your goal is the finals. Gotta be thankful Landry is a thing.
356 2018-11-14 00:27:24 I don't see where joe made any suggestion to ban any of the competing currencies/commodities/cryptos just a theoretical point against deflationary, "risk free" 'money'
357 2018-11-14 00:24:40 That's also why I love Die Hard 3, because Bruce gives Samuel L. Jackson a bar as a "gift" and I toured the Federal Reserve in lower Manhattan that the movie was based on, before they shut those tours down after 9/11. Commodities are a VERY real part of wealth.
358 2018-11-14 00:16:06 Nossa, claro. Trabalhar com pleno emprego e taxa de inflação média controlada, reduzir a DLSP e a Divida Bruta, reduzir a pobreza e retirar o país do Mapa da Fome valem menos que dois anos de recessão. E claro, n levaremos em conta a queda das commodities e o complô no Congresso
359 2018-11-14 00:13:34 Nopes. There's nothing like missing trade. It may open at 610 and presents gr8 opportunity to sell. Remember, all metals n commodities r down since last month. N mkts look ahead n trade. Tata Steel will b below 500 in a month. Keep watching
360 2018-11-14 00:09:02 #Oil prices have dropped from a 4 year high to a #bear #market in 6 weeks!!! #Commodities #markets #stocks #StockMarket #investing #investments #WallStreet #Finance #economics #economy
361 2018-11-14 00:05:49 Difícil dizer para onde o mercado irá caminhar e até mesmo se isto é uma tendência. O que acho que é factível hoje, é analisar que o USA não vão crescer indeterminadamente e que a China pode reduzir seu crescimento, diminuindo a demanda por commodities.
362 2018-11-14 00:05:32 Totalmente. Hace 3 años que los supuestos son concuerdan con la evidencia. Sequía primero inundaciones despues. Super dólar, commodities en minimos. China bajando act. econó. Tax War. Retenciones. Brasil nos pasa por arriba. Mi sentido común me dice que está vez no es diferente.
363 2018-11-14 00:03:36 Looking at the bright side, I'm glad I've been raised by two parents who repeated me 'Most employers only care about their profit, employees are just commodities for them'. I would've let myself be fooled by all the fake 'gratifications' otherwise. #workersrights #itsnotright
364 2018-11-14 00:00:33 Isso quer dizer q as commodities não se recuperam?
