48 2018-04-04 21:18:34 Tell that to the farmers to the soy and pork farmers who saw pork commodities down about 5% today. Soy down 0.21 per bushel. This hurts farmers not Wall st.

50 2018-04-04 21:04:35 And tough guy Trump is sticking it to farmers in the USA via tariffs. Pork/agricultural commodities down significantly today costing billions to farms over the long term Ioea, Illinois & North Carolina all hurt just from tariffs on pork. Many more will be hurt via soybean

80 2018-04-04 18:58:00 My problem with the "where would they be without him" argument is that it substitutes the unknowable/unknown for the knowable/known commodities.

92 2018-04-04 18:22:12 @DanaPerino Tariffs on commodities are ineffective. Worldwide supply/demand doesn’t change. Dislocations will be short-lived. Most commodities are “fungible.”
93 2018-04-04 18:20:03 Astoria has had an out of consensus bullish view on commodities since Q4 '17.  They are 1) uncorrelated 2) under-owned 3) historically do well as inflation rises & during the later stages of the economic cycle.  We like agriculture, energy, and metals (industrial & precious).

128 2018-04-04 16:42:25 I disagree.. just a definition, though and there is room for disagreement. the agreement is what creates the money.. that's how finance works.. the debt can be settled with commodities, if accepted by both parties.. the commodity is not the 'money', the agreement is..

137 2018-04-04 16:07:48 How about losing a trillion?  That sounds worse.

138 2018-04-04 16:07:31 The incidence of transport on total price of commodities does not exceed 5℅ normally. Otherwise, it wouldn't be good business. Considering 30℅ hike in oil price impact on total price will be .015℅ on total price. How that can that kill poor people?

160 2018-04-04 15:21:34 Thanks for posting this. I live in a state with lots of farms, almost all of them family businesses. We're not too likely to be impacted here, but for those producers, especially in the mid-country and west, who mono-crop or raise just a few commodities, they will be in trouble.

If demand goes down (since we're writing off a chunk of the market), it doesn't affect prices, right?  I'm thinking back to econ classes, but you're saying thats how supply & demand works, right?

211 2018-04-04 13:28:31 I absolutely believe the west is complicit in this. ''To find out who/ what controls you, find out who/ what you cannot criticise''. But as these ppl in the M.E are mere commodities, their deaths, torture & illegal organ harvesting, just isn't worth talking about in the MSM.
212 2018-04-04 13:25:32 And it’s new. Animist religions and views have been prominent throughout humanity until the Agricultural revolution when we stopped seeing animals as equal and started seeing them as commodities. Animal cruelty is new and man made. Not some natural or habitual behaviour

220 2018-04-04 13:09:12 Therefore, on account of ignorance & insanity the $50 B imports from China @ 25% Tariffs means that Debt increases ~$12•5 B / year & there's no guarantee that China has to buy pork & other commodities to sustain any realistic Balance of Trade beneficial to reducing our debts
221 2018-04-04 13:08:45 What’s happening to the price of commodities I wonder? Especially pork and soybeans.
222 2018-04-04 13:07:37 Watch the commodities markets as much as Wall Street. Soybean and hog futures both lower. Trump country is going to pay a huge price. #tariffs #WednesdayWisdom
223 2018-04-04 13:05:09 "From [the refineries'] perspective, adding to the mainline is not really going to make much difference to their purchase of crude oil, or the price of crude oil for them," said Sandy Fielden, director of research for commodities and energy at Morningstar.
224 2018-04-04 13:03:28 Because you don’t spend $750mm to “remake” a company that has absolutely nothing of tangible or strategic value at all. If Jeff wants to sell physical commodities or do blockchain-blockchain-something, he doesn’t need anything from $LFIN. They have nothing.

227 2018-04-04 12:47:19 The American farmer is taking a beating this morning as the Chinese retaliate with tariffs against ag commodities.

231 2018-04-04 12:40:40 Stocks and grain commodities are set to plunge back into correction territory after China announces new tariffs
232 2018-04-04 12:40:40 Haha, im not talking about the power going out mate, I'm saying crypto is not immune due to its reliance on global hard commodities and international govt regulations. There4 not immune to geopolitics. Gold at this time still remains the best hedge.

235 2018-04-04 12:36:10 I think it's interesting because this is the same guy who traded the RGIII pick for a boatload of selection and most of them failed to pan out, so maybe that experience has led him to making moves for known commodities?

237 2018-04-04 12:32:30 Chinese importers expecting cargoes of U.S. commodities from beef to propane said they hope to sell the goods to South Korea or Japan after Beijing's decision to slap extra tariffs on a swathe of items from agricultural products to chemicals.

239 2018-04-04 12:32:13 The speed with which the TRADE WAR between #Trump & Beijing is ratcheting up – the Chinese took less than 11 hours to respond...and respond hard – led to a sharp selloff in global stock markets and commodities #Dow #TrumpTradeWar

241 2018-04-04 12:30:55 So all #commodities being hammered today as #tariffs are anounced. Except #gold. Heck even #bitcoin can’t hold to gains. But in the end...this too will fade.
242 2018-04-04 12:28:04 Do we not have to raise the price 50% percent or more over the cost to produce so we can put them on sale like clothing stores with China clothing #Soybean and commodities in general
243 2018-04-04 12:25:43 Ojo que si la medida de aranceles dura mas de 1 año o 2 puede que el CBOT deje de ser el mercado principal de negociacion de commodities y pueda ser Rosario o alguno de Brasil.

245 2018-04-04 12:18:11 @twitter lets @POTUS tweet because lets face it, we are the commodities. He has a lot of followers to advertise to, and that is the dirty secret of the internet.  

How much are YOU worth by being on a social platform and seeing their adverts?  Just look at what they own. Wakeup.
246 2018-04-04 12:17:36 Is there anything more grim than a person saying they've "had" someone? People aren't commodities, genuinely makes my skin crawl
247 2018-04-04 12:11:35 And we're off: #Bonds are the calm within the storm - barely moving - because tariffs slow growth and raise inflation.  Which do you pick?  Soybeans and non-oil commodities are taking a big hit.
248 2018-04-04 12:10:30 Los traders venden "logística" mas que "commodities", por lo que esa sustitución de mercados parece razonable. Pero no ajusta de un mes al otro.
249 2018-04-04 12:09:40 @warrenleightTV Every time I read anything "Facebook news" they put out, I feel like they're blowing smoke up my skirt. Do not trust them at all. These giants use us as commodities. #BoycottAmazon #BoycottApple #BoycottFacebook #BoycottGoogle
250 2018-04-04 12:06:27 For a very long time salt slabs were used as money. People were paid in salt.

There is an old saying to show if someone is paid appropriately they would say:
HE IS WORTH HIS SALT.

So, commodities like salt can be used as money.
251 2018-04-04 12:05:07 "Immune to geopolitical issues" lol yeah, sorry, but no. Cost of a crypto transaction = a ton of energy = electricity comes from hard commodities = very exposed to geopolitics. Diversify your portfolio, buy some gold, fall in love with making $, not an asset class.

254 2018-04-04 11:55:16 Creative works are in a wildly different economic category from food, materials, and commodities. Attempting to use them as bargaining chips at the same table is like comparing apples to Superman IV. This is why you kept going bankrupt. Please stop.
255 2018-04-04 11:52:16 See something ern pork was 2 cedis at Maclean joint but with inflation coming down in Ghana, they have increased it to 3 cedis. That is a whooping 50% increase. Gov't must such arbitrary increases in essential commodities like pork
256 2018-04-04 11:33:44 Raoul put out an interesting piece on RVTV this morning still talking about a rip your face off rally in dollar and drop in commodities and stocks.  Key is google chart and oil he says.  Go watch.

260 2018-04-04 11:13:44 Now, what are commodities? Commodities are agricultural products. Like coffee, that you had for breakfast...wheat, which is used to make bread...pork bellies, which is used to make bacon--which you might find in a bacon, lettuce, and tomatosandwich!
261 2018-04-04 11:10:17 Copper and other commodities also took a huge dump. Trump's mouth is actually helping us. How oil behaves at 61.60-ish could hold the key for now :)
262 2018-04-04 11:07:44 It may not matter girl. Trump and his unnecessary trade war is bad for commodities.
263 2018-04-04 11:06:00 China tariffs hit Trump’s base in America as China targets autos, soft commodities, whiskey distillers, etc...think the majority of these exporters/business owners voted for Trump in 2016?

Then God bless India..
310 2018-04-04 08:09:21 Desai has not observed that the prices of all essential commodities are under control except petroleum products. The reason is state Govts not reducing their taxes on petroleum products. There is no devaluation of rupee. In fact Demonetization has brought us value for our money.

312 2018-04-04 08:02:34 Disagree. Markets don't always treat consumers fairly so some intervention necessary. Plus it is right to ensure we can access vital commodities, goods and servicies plus maintain the right skill base.

314 2018-04-04 07:57:29 Surely, we should be buying soft commodities on this, no? Assuming unchanged demand. Which is a big assumption to be fair! or do producers have zero market power to pass on the tax?

348 2018-04-04 03:36:32 China will now react in kind and put a 30% tariff on soybeans and other  commodities that it can get elsewhere.  The farmers who voted for Trump  will get exactly what they voted for....a "stable" genius who know  everything better than anyone else.  So, is this "winning?"

369 2018-04-04 01:40:56 This is a key concept to understand in #Bitcoin. In most commodities, a rise in price results in a rise is supply, but that is impossible with Bitcoin (which makes the price go even higher).

371 2018-04-04 01:34:51 Butta based on your conversation I’m assuming you care more about the fundamentals. I agree with you but this market is nothing like stocks, commodities, or forex. White paper is very important just as well as the people behind it. I think your doubts are justified. DYOR
372 2018-04-04 01:33:47 It is worse than drooling insanity.

Baldwin is blatantly and shamelessly perverting Biblical verse to sell one of the most lethal commodities on the market in the US.

377 2018-04-04 00:54:01 Simple investments. Balance your portfolio with known commodities, that may cost more, alongside futures that may or may not pan out. Acuna looks legit and both Austin Reilly and Pache had a great spring but if you can sign Harper or Machado you do it.
378 2018-04-04 00:53:42 I think I’d rather keep Fournier. Need some known commodities. Fournier serves his role well. Magic just ask him to do too much.

390 2018-04-04 00:08:47 Did you get Sanchez for free? No. You had to send Mkhi the other way to get Sanchez. Players are commodities, don't be so naive.
