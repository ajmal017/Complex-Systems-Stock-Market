61 2018-01-22 20:14:42 I feel that this is a similar reflex for most commodities that have been severely depressed over the last 7 years.

Essential commodities where shared based on Civil Service rank
64 2018-01-22 20:00:33 Why the prices of essential Commodities are gone high never come down? Nobody is bothered about price rise Business goes as usual.Rediculous

76 2018-01-22 18:56:03 I witnessed a whole constituency getting seed and fertilizers yet they are not farmers and I again witnessed some buyers of those commodities doing rounds buying from beneficiaries. It's simple these people were given what they don't need and never asked for.

110 2018-01-22 15:57:18 It was interesting to explore the different ways that the short was implemented (and I wish I had space to explore this in more depth) but worth noting that it seems most did focus correctly on the rebalancing implications. Ie commodities fallout.

112 2018-01-22 15:41:53 but hard I think to short corporate credit for a host of reasons (including ever present possibility of a bailout).  my sense is that the trade often reduced to shorting the currency or shorting commodities
113 2018-01-22 15:39:52 government shutdown has more political implications than economic. If you look at how government shutdowns have affected other commodities (like gold) in the past, you'll see there's not really any impact.

126 2018-01-22 14:47:38 Not a very intelligent solution. By all these means & ways we r making the foundation f reservation more strong. Good sale prices of commodities is something farmer seeks frm ech n evry govt.rather thn reservation for their own.
127 2018-01-22 14:47:10 and we can all become professors AFTER the facts lol... those who hodl'd wish they could have afforded more at the time ... commodities are run on speculation NOT trading. The etymology is very different. Don't speculate, ANTICIPATE. That's what a true futurist does. 1/2

142 2018-01-22 13:58:26 Sonny, I realize your concerned about protecting the value of commodities for the packers. How about taking the producer into consideration in regards to COOL and the mislabeling of foreign beef as US product. That would help more than voluntary market reporting!

243 2018-01-22 03:45:59 Mohan Baghar [Gardener, Sambalpur]: He wanted to fulfil his son’s wish 2 watch #TigerZindaHai but that would mean an expenditure of Rs 300/ ticket. “When the prices of vegs & other essential commodities r increasing, I cannot think of spending Rs 600 on 2 movie tickets.”

Pistols for commodities
245 2018-01-22 03:29:16 By the way Amy...if you saw "Hart of Dixie" show, a couple lived in a boat and they had all the commodities in there.  It's on Netflix
246 2018-01-22 03:29:05 #CrudeOil prices in green, after 1.5% decline prev week. Unease over surging US output continue. Geopolitical concerns, fall in global inventories, @OPECnews & Russia cuts support  #Commodities

248 2018-01-22 03:25:32 Em 1970 o Brasil exportava commodities e a Coreia do Sul não era nada. Hoje, após educação, inovação e C&T o Tigre Asiático é referência e nós continuamos nas mesmas commodities.
249 2018-01-22 03:22:46 You can't compare physical commodities to artificial digital ones. You can't print gold/silver/copper out of thin air. The demand is in blockchain tech and more and more coins created can do what Bitcoin can. First mover advantage does not last.
250 2018-01-22 03:17:19 A3: School improvement cannot happen without teacher support of the campus vision. Teachers are the cogs that keep the campus moving toward success. They are the first line of contact with our most precious commodities, our students and their families. #EngagementChat

253 2018-01-22 02:34:21 agreed but they can then become commodities if sold by people
254 2018-01-22 02:30:11 Like thousands of other equities and commodities the value has not been properly priced, that's what makes the markets work.  Finding undervalued trade opportunities is where profits lie.
255 2018-01-22 02:30:01 i mean under capitalism I don’t disagree that everything can be a commodity but it fails to account for the social relations involved in the transferal of commodities both as commodities and as gifts
256 2018-01-22 02:28:54 I am talking about it specifically in object biographies and during history when commodities still existed but things changed more fluidly
257 2018-01-22 02:26:39 speeding x-rays compete below omegic commodities,

258 2018-01-22 02:15:14 How incredibly naive of you. Coal is one of the most important commodities we have. Crude oil is running out and coal will be necessary to live in the future. The world is living in an economy system that is an expansive bubble. Progress is finite

264 2018-01-22 01:42:41 Isn't this just adding an unnecessary layer of complexity on commodities trading?

267 2018-01-22 01:28:17 Pirates traded 2 commodities in Cutch and Cole and lowest possible value while getting Zero impact players back in either deal . Also had to throw in 2 mil to Giants . Huntington Hurdle and Coonelly are a major part of this franchises huge  problems .
268 2018-01-22 01:21:59 Hola Deimonn, mis objetivos para con este papel son muy ambiciosos. Si se dan las cosas como pienso con los commodities, tendría un gran upside al igual que APBR. En las dos considero un Patrón Gartley Alcista. Podes ver el de PGR en trading view, con un objetivo el los $30 a MP.
269 2018-01-22 01:11:13 What will the market Look like for Foles in the off-season? Seems like both these quarterbacks will be hot commodities.

274 2018-01-22 00:44:36 From a technical stock chart perspective.. the dollar will rip higher very soon.  So oil gold and other Commodities along with corporate earnings will get crushed... This is likely the last hurrah of the dollar in my opinion before a big Plunge
275 2018-01-22 00:43:06 Seems like every year the speakers at the resource convention are bullish commodities, I wonder why??
276 2018-01-22 00:40:14 COT is not reliable for currencies. Impossible to tell who are commercials and who are specs. Better for physical commodities.
277 2018-01-22 00:38:58 Yes, commodities like food! trumps interest rate hikes raised prices on everything. People trying to live on a fixed income get hurt. Obama managed the economy better so the Fed didn't raise rates.

279 2018-01-22 00:23:46 Both characters were known commodities in that situation and therefore it didn't need to happen to move the needle in WCW. Doesn't compare to Brandi Rhodes and Karen Q in WOH. Good try though.

Disagreements. Key reports will not be issued. The U.S. dollar will suffer.

284 2018-01-22 00:11:33 Women are viewed as ONLY commodities that are on display just waiting to be plucked up after the man is done sowing his Oates.  Religion is responsible for a lot of the reasons women have been considered 2nd class citizens, hell Eve was blamed 100% for the apple incident,
