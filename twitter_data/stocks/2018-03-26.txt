2 2018-03-26 23:59:21 Overall, I care about black people and their safety first. The gun violence in our communities have nothing to do with ar-15’s, bump stocks and waiting periods.

I prefer black people armed & trained, building and creating jobs & other opportunities for our youth & each other.
3 2018-03-26 23:58:51 I believe the NRA is, for the first time, scared. They have no justification for bump stocks & ARs. All they can do is personal attacks. Thing is, I believe these kids see right through that.
4 2018-03-26 23:57:09 Their failure to pass significant gun reform legislation is a travesty. They couldn’t even ban freaking BUMP STOCKS after Las Vegas. 

I don’t care if this hurts your feelings, or their feelings: Blood is on their hands.
5 2018-03-26 23:56:19 I’m really keen to give blood but whenever I try and book there’s always like a 2 month wait  if stocks are low, surely more appointments should be available?

8 2018-03-26 23:55:14 Hey Spanky, so you take credit when DOW goes up, but say nothing about it dropping 1000 points because of your tariff war you started. But overall it has been a good year with stocks since you took office. Just not sure it's all because of you. Maybe ?

How much money are you and your friends making dumping stocks, then putting them on your tariff list ????

I really don’t get you. Then move on! Why waste all these energy. Seriously.
Thousands of stocks out there.

This is only for serious investors. Short term doesn’t work.
41 2018-03-26 23:52:25 Just noticed that Rite Aid stocks the baby stuff right next to the birth control. One might say I noticed way, way too late.
42 2018-03-26 23:51:25 With trade concerns subsiding, many investors refocused on the factors that have helped boost stocks in recent months. The U.S. economy remains strong potentially providing fuel to the nine-year bull market
43 2018-03-26 23:51:18 Nothing has been banned yet.  I believe the Ban AR-15 People want Assault Type rifles banned, along with high capacity magazines, bump stocks, comprehensive background checks for all gun purchases.  Also guns are registered, w/liability Ins., for owners & manufacturers.
44 2018-03-26 23:50:57 This is true. Although, they can't keep them low forever.
2-5yr Treasury Notes are the best investment right now. 
paying 2.3-2.7% 
backed by the full faith and credit of the Government.
Banks are not secure (over 250k) and 1.5% is best rate you'll find. 
Stocks too risky.
45 2018-03-26 23:49:03 Fine, you can keep your 1791 musket and your flintlock pistol, but the 21st century assault-style shit and bump stocks are overkill and don't trump my inalienable right to life.

52 2018-03-26 23:45:33 US stocks up or down, dollar down. Really surprised gold had not lifted more
53 2018-03-26 23:45:17 @realDonaldTrump You’ve banished Russian diplomats from America. Check. You ban Bump Stocks. Check. Will you ban AR15 and AK47 weapons? Pending. Will you support DACA recipients? When you know better, you do better! And you can do much better!
54 2018-03-26 23:44:43 Mj stocks are hotter than crypto..here's my order from that list:
1. MJ Stocks
2. Gold stocks
3. Oil stocks
4. Crypto stocks
55 2018-03-26 23:43:55 It was more likely Israel and #mossad  with their history of assassinations on foreign soil, stocks of chemical weapons.They have motive,Russia helping their enemy Syria who bought missiles,VX gas from N korea, If Russia wanted Skripal dead they would of made it look accidental.
56 2018-03-26 23:43:27 Maybe doesn't work as good on crypto as on stocks, but certainly a valuable tool to make educated decisions when you know how to properly do TA. I wouldn't generalize it so quickly
57 2018-03-26 23:42:54 You think it's going to go down? I think it's firmly staying on the next leg up and once we break .02 it's game on. .0266 is the only resistance from there
58 2018-03-26 23:42:01 Have successfully started three companies and trade stocks and commodities for over thirty years. Those publications plus other financial newsletters work fine for me.
59 2018-03-26 23:41:00 Perfect example of why Progressive party cannot be trusted to support sensible increases bavkgroubd checks, or ban bump stocks, because goal isn’t safety, it’s political! Obama tried to put lead smelters out of buss with regulation, now this, it’s example of why nothings done!
60 2018-03-26 23:40:59 The issue I have with these kind of comments.. Many were not around nor showed up when stock went up and was trading in the 80’s now that it’s down from there, I and @AlderLaneeggs get trolled constantly. Why bashers care about what stocks we have when bashers have no position...
61 2018-03-26 23:40:42 NSE starts week in loss, 17 stocks slide
62 2018-03-26 23:39:53 Stocks can go up or down day by day--Yawn
63 2018-03-26 23:39:40 Rebellious people, mentally challenged people, depressed people....with guns. Deadly combination.
What you people don't understand is that we want stricter laws, no loopholes at gun shows, complete background checks and ban bump stocks. I live in a home with guns. So...
64 2018-03-26 23:38:58 nice I just pulled out my money in stocks and gunna try day trading crypto soon it just moves faster, hopefully you keep it up
65 2018-03-26 23:38:51 @seanhannity I hear that OBAMA was the one who Legalized Bump stocks. Is that True??
66 2018-03-26 23:38:31 Floor Trader’s Secret!

67 2018-03-26 23:38:12 @realDonaldTrump I'm really scared of the spending. I understand the military needed it. Please let's not do this again Mr. President. I am a average American who stocks shelves for a living. I'm still with you Mr. President
68 2018-03-26 23:37:37 Stocks are up, what happened to "muh trade war, it's the end, head for the borders!" 

I need to start betting money on this politics stuff
69 2018-03-26 23:37:32 The only guns anyone is talking about taking away are AR-15s. Bump stocks too. Those aren’t recreational and no one needs them for protection. Otherwise, I’m totally fine with sane, licensed gun owners having handguns and shotguns. I don’t want one though.

72 2018-03-26 23:36:13 Ar15s are designed to do maximum damage and create large exit wounds. Your semi auto handguns dont have the option to add bump stocks and hundred round clips either. One was designed for defense. One was designed to take to war. #TiredOfTheIgnorance

75 2018-03-26 23:34:51 Options... nobody doubles in 1 day in stocks!!!
76 2018-03-26 23:34:20 Yes, there’s a lot of other stocks out there that I’m also in and trading.. It’s just my DD that keeps me in $OSTK this I don’t trade it and I’m willing to stick with @OverstockCEO and @AlderLaneeggs .. Thanks for the heads up. Contacts that told you..Hmm..
77 2018-03-26 23:34:05 So what laws where discussed? Any bills passed? Any policies targeted for change besides bump stocks cause that was pre march?
78 2018-03-26 23:33:41 Instead of Trump banning bump-stocks, he should just move Marijuana off the controlled substance list.

102 2018-03-26 23:22:29 @realDonaldTrump Dear President Trump, my wife and I are disappointed in your stance against the so called "bump stocks" as it is not a gun but only a part for a gun and it seems to us that you may be backing down on the 2nd amendment. Sad to see as we felt you would be stronger.
103 2018-03-26 23:22:01 @AnnCoulter ain't slick! She's been waiting for a chance to distance herself from that dumsterfire! She knows he's going down. Just a rat trying to save herself on the ship! Let's see how she responds AFTER Trump gives in to her whining on bump stocks and the like...
104 2018-03-26 23:21:51 I’m trying to make sense of why they’re buying back stocks instead of paying off their debt. They brings shareholders returns in the short term, but it puts the long term viability of the business in jeopardy while interest rates rise and their debt gets more expensive.
105 2018-03-26 23:21:47 As expected. But will tech stocks be dead weight on the market?
106 2018-03-26 23:21:11 Waiting for a pure esports stock to IPO c’mon its gonna be huge with winnings in the million dollar range. Just like poker.
107 2018-03-26 23:19:07 Bump Stocks aren't regulated under Gun Control Act or  National Firearms Act. NRA Rep.Amy Hunter & ATF’s (Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearm) Tech. Chief John Spencer determined it was a "firearm part" & not a firearm therefore Obama could not regulate it. Parts aren't regulated by law.
108 2018-03-26 23:18:25 Crypto stocks are dead right now
109 2018-03-26 23:18:17 I'd say my own weakness for me. Is that I try to hard to make Sonic exciting to watch. Often forcing things you just can't always force, but when everything is going well it can lead to taking stocks early, flustering opponents, & things like that.
110 2018-03-26 23:18:13 Why didn't you tweet good news when you caused the stocks to drop a thousand points when you announce the tariffs? Oh wait that would be bad news huh you're Putin's puppet president

112 2018-03-26 23:17:51 every time I hear someone say not to keep all your eggs in one basket, I automatically think of a stocks & bond investment portfolio lmfaoooo 
113 2018-03-26 23:17:10 Beauty deals @ultabeauty are a joke. The items sell out to the point I don't even think the store stocks up for the deal. #NotASteal #notADeal
114 2018-03-26 23:17:07 Not much other than their was an issue and shortage; which we knew, but their fixing it as quickly as possible and to order online where stocks are higher than in store. Hopefully be sorted soon...
115 2018-03-26 23:16:52 I think the actual take is that Trump boasts that the stock market is up but its super volatile. So gloating about a sudden rise after a steep drop isn’t saying much especially since he caused the drop. A trade war makes the Rich folks nervous so they pulled their stocks.
116 2018-03-26 23:14:51 Our stocks are up. I know Bc I work in a financial advising firm and a lot of people and businesses here are now doing very well.
117 2018-03-26 23:12:43 Really? Does "greatly reduce the grave risks" mean war?  Here we go again.  Is this the only way you see that you can keep this President from being impeached?  Or is it that your portfolios are filled with wartime stocks?  Why else would you back this decision?
118 2018-03-26 23:12:19 Kinda like the stock market.  Tech co stocks even higher.  See AMZN and NFLX.
119 2018-03-26 23:11:08 great...just when the ammo market started to stabilize after the last hoarding binge, we get to play again. Buy stocks in ammo companies.
120 2018-03-26 23:10:01 That's pretty odd. Usually their stocks and sales got up after mass shootings, and we've been having quite a bit of them lately.
121 2018-03-26 23:09:34 I am a vendor who stocks magazines such as this one in my area. I have almost free rein on which issues can be featured, so I'll be sure to return these copies when I go to the stores this week.
122 2018-03-26 23:08:24 That was a big move in the markets, time to start looking into bullish setups again.. I would likely to see an early dip tomorrow for some buy ops or just buy stocks entering breakouts
123 2018-03-26 23:08:12 Trump did not outlaw bump stocks. Educate yourself.
124 2018-03-26 23:06:14 Stocks and so much more. I’m really winning.
125 2018-03-26 23:06:10 So...no stock bumps for bump stocks?

Every time this happens my Mum stocks up, as if she sends letters all the time 
134 2018-03-26 23:03:49 Better background checks where all agencies have the same info and a national system of checks and states have to comply. Ban of buno stocks, ban of assault rifles automatic and semi-automatic. 3 days waiting period after a purchase

137 2018-03-26 23:03:03 Today is only good day for stock market bc Swiss govt infused $133 b into USA stock market through 200 secret hidden Pty's (Pty Ltd - go have look who bought stocks then cross reference companies, they are registered in Switzerland). They cant keep doing it, lol FED not honest

139 2018-03-26 23:01:17 WOW!  There'll be a lot of celebrating in all those little coal mining towns tonite. Their stocks are through the roof.
140 2018-03-26 23:00:37 RB / Mullen / Fox / Dura / Visa CB / Doyle / Libby wouldn't be to bad for defensive stocks. Hard part is finding a non visa RB, guess you could chuck Tratt's name into the mix if he wants to come back.
141 2018-03-26 23:00:22 And we’re going to, what? exactly? Rise up in righteous patriotism with our bump stocks and execute him on the East steps of the Capitol? THOUSANDS in their graves over the decades due to gun deaths just to wait for a moronic POTUS suicidal Red Dawn cosplay? 

It is to laugh.
142 2018-03-26 23:00:22 Most stocks went down LW. $DIS was on it's way 110 when Comcast stepped in to compete for $SKY. $DIS Movies are #1@ the BO. Parks and Cruises are packed. Manufacturers are fighting to get $DIS Consumer Products. $4.99 ESPN and DTC Streaming to follow. I respectfully disagree.
143 2018-03-26 23:00:12 How do you take the profit out of elephant poaching? Create a legal market for the sale of ivory on a consistent basis from stocks that are available, from animals that die of natural causes, and from animals that are culled to bring herds into balance with their habitat.
144 2018-03-26 22:59:13 you speak of treason and stocks phillip and im the one in the dark ages,, 
get some sleep sounds like you need it
145 2018-03-26 22:58:47 1. The ATF ruled that a "bump stock" was not a firearm and was not covered under The Gun Control Act or national Firearms Act - they were never NOT legal
2. I agree that bump stocks should be illegal, however It will probably take an act of Congress to do so
(Cont'd)

148 2018-03-26 22:56:45 The question is...what stocks will benefit?
149 2018-03-26 22:56:40 Banning bump stocks did absolutely nothing ..bump fire was around waaaay before a bump stock ..all you need is a finger
150 2018-03-26 22:54:02 You obviously don't know much abt the market. If you did you'd know that this uptick is the result of people buying up what had become 'cheap stocks' as the result of a downturn. It happens EVERY TIME there is a precipitous drop like that.

You had nothing to do w/it, sweetie.
151 2018-03-26 22:53:22 Have u even read the newly passed gun bill and do U even know how bump stocks work and how they effect illegal gun purchases?   Have u ever researched the types of guns out there and what is available to civilians? U cant base decisions off of emotions. U must do it with facts.
152 2018-03-26 22:53:16 Big day for stocks, China says willing to discuss trade inbalances (instead of fighting a China-US trade war)
153 2018-03-26 22:51:23 I hope everyone bought tech stocks today. Actually, just about any stocks today. Even gold. It was all up.
154 2018-03-26 22:51:21 #Liberals say #Trump is ruining America. Ummm...Stocks, jobs, wages, consumer confidence, and manufacturing are ALL up!  Taxes are down and companies are coming back to America!  North Korea is wanting to talk, ISIS has lost all its land!  I can live with that ruination! 

#MAGA
155 2018-03-26 22:51:04 Another false narrative and a narrative that’s not covered in the mainstream media. You did know that this administration banned bump stocks, the same bump stocks that your beloved Democrats made legal. So who exactly doesn’t care?
156 2018-03-26 22:50:36 Didn't I read Z sold a load of stocks while the price was still high?  He took care of himself alright.  Insider trading?  How many friends did he advise to do the same???@FBI remembering @MarthaStewart

161 2018-03-26 22:48:33 Not sure why you bring up bump stocks- they are already illegal and there was no bump stock involved in Parkland shooting.  Try harder
162 2018-03-26 22:47:35 Where were the marches after sandy hook or other shootings and protests when obama greenlit bump stocks,they liked obama so he got a pass, #Trump has just banned stocks meaning he's passed more control than obama did-i get the feeling #MarchForOurLives is an anti Trump march.
163 2018-03-26 22:47:03 I got a size 11

168 2018-03-26 22:44:46 I’m exercising 1A to state a position that we already have limitations on 2A I just want some more sensible limitations like banning AR-15 type weapons and Drum Magazines and bump stocks
169 2018-03-26 22:44:00 The NRA gave us plenty of gifts in the form of support for the National Firearms Act, the Gun Control Act, the 1994 weapons ban, and the current legislation to ban bump stocks. With all respect, I think the NRA has done enough.
170 2018-03-26 22:42:52 #USDA, los stocks de maíz en USA al 1 de marzo de 2018 se estiman en promedio en 221.6 MT, los mas elevados en casi cien años a esa fecha, estamos en mitad de la campaña 2017/18
171 2018-03-26 22:42:41 We're so sorry but Banana Nut Cheerios were a limited edition flavor over winter. There may be some boxes left while stocks last! We promise we'll let our team know you'd love them to be a permanent part of the line-up. 
172 2018-03-26 22:42:38 I'm aware of what a bump stock is. I also know you don't need a bump stock to bump fire, bump stocks can also be manufactured in a home or small machine shop. Banning them is fine, but it won't really help.
173 2018-03-26 22:42:38 Does anyone trade stocks?? I need someone to talk to I’m addicted
174 2018-03-26 22:42:07 Lmao I'm really bad at most fighters. Most memorable moments was getting someone to Gentleman to Pilot Wings in Sm4sh and laughing at the stupid stage hazard stocks I got
175 2018-03-26 22:41:41 Are you familiar with the 9th and 10th Amendments? Where in the Constitution does it give the federal government the authority to ban and regulate bump stocks?
176 2018-03-26 22:41:34 go easy on leo,, because he is easier led than a flock of sheep no need for treason jibes,,,,yet,,, anyhow he might enjoy the stocks
177 2018-03-26 22:41:03 My stocks getting greener and greener 
178 2018-03-26 22:39:31 Also don't forget: "Bump stocks would have been banned under legislation Diane Feinstein introduced after the 2012 shooting of elementary students in Newtown, Conn. That effort collapsed." Remember who made sure nothing happened after that horrible event.
179 2018-03-26 22:39:25 “Not doing anything to help” like having the STOP School Violence Act passed, the NICS bill passed, “red flag” bill proposed, banning bump stocks... want me to continue?
180 2018-03-26 22:38:54 Bump stocks were a clever way around *other* regulations though. He never signed legislation, there was a ruling from the ATF. I also recall Obama being called "acting like a king" for all the executive orders he *did* try to get around a stonewalling Republican congress.
181 2018-03-26 22:38:53 Economy is looking good for folks who own stocks...less than half of Americans.  Everything else, a shit show
182 2018-03-26 22:38:48 What happens when everyday items become to expensive to purchase? 
For example, gas prices jumped dramatically in a week based on speculations of the tariff.  But that does mean the stocks of these companies are impacted, just the opposite.  
Bad for the people, good for CEO's.
183 2018-03-26 22:38:45 where is that information .. I cannot find a press release or the filings?
184 2018-03-26 22:37:59 same as stocks though, you could sell near the high and someone loaded up all in which took out your sell
185 2018-03-26 22:37:57 Ummmmm. Still down overall. I've lost over 10k since Friday. So stocks down, gas prices up. Why would anyone have ever thought a moron who bankrupted his own company 7 times could do a good job for the country?!???
186 2018-03-26 22:37:40 Nice to see the stocks recovering once again.... 
187 2018-03-26 22:37:25 But that wont bring my lost stocks back! My poor stocks:(
188 2018-03-26 22:36:32 Haha ok. You were proven ignorant and want to debate grammar now. I actually agree with banning the sale of bump stocks, someone willing to mimic automatic fire on a semi auto could still use belt to do so.
189 2018-03-26 22:36:28 What a day for global #stocks! All major indexes across the globe making sharp gains with the exception of #Russia. #trading #bull
190 2018-03-26 22:36:08 my stocks are down, down, down
191 2018-03-26 22:35:35 The stocks related to them are in a bubble, Amazon is profitable but much of the value is from speculation. they run on very slim margins, similar to Wal-Mart. many of these companies have also done huge stock buy backs with extra cash inflating their stock prices as well.
192 2018-03-26 22:35:18 @realDonaldTrump NO ONE CARES ABOUT STOCKS ESPECIALLY THE MIDDLE CLASS RICH BOY! GAS PRICES ARE GOING THRU THE ROOF YOU DO NOTHING!
193 2018-03-26 22:35:14 Of course the Stormy "storm" is over so they bought 'em, apparently. IIRC that's what Cramer said! #stocks

198 2018-03-26 22:33:27 Hey Mr. President. It might be time to revamp the 401k plans and let people invest their own money in the stocks, futures, or options they want.
199 2018-03-26 22:33:06 He’s going to do whatever it takes to get FaceBook stocks back up. Don’t hold your breath for anything else!
200 2018-03-26 22:31:31 Trump announces tariffs: liberals sell stocks and market drops. China immediately buckles and wants to negotiate and market jumps huge.
201 2018-03-26 22:31:14 Speculation and news drives the price up or down just like stocks crypto may not be exactly like stocks but it’s very similar in certain aspects and at the end of the day it’s all about business and making money for investors and those who work on coins.
202 2018-03-26 22:30:03 I’m in a bad place Oliver I need support
203 2018-03-26 22:29:53 My personal thoughts when stocks hold gains from previous market lows($SPX) you stick to the trend of price. Every time Market dips and your ticker slightly pulls just wait  for that boost and new high push!
204 2018-03-26 22:29:42 I have no problem with banning bump stocks.  The NFA passed in 1934 made fully automatic weapons illegal without a huge paper trail and a large tax.  Turning a semi-auto into a fully auto via any method should be illegal. As far as mags are concerned 1/2
205 2018-03-26 22:29:36 Didn’t he cashed selling stocks last month?! Of course he is thinking  on resignation he wallet is filled with corruption 
206 2018-03-26 22:29:29 Says a lot about you

209 2018-03-26 22:28:25 Bump stocks have been banned by our wonderful president, but do you think a bad guy could still get his hands on one if he wanted to???

212 2018-03-26 22:27:55 but the stocks plumetted last week so the numbers haven't been on the rise since January. down and up
213 2018-03-26 22:27:32 Meanwhile biggest one-day gain in 2-1/2 years U.S. stocks rose to 650 ''Stormy Daniels Nothing Burger''
214 2018-03-26 22:27:12 $SPY Some won't be convinced it's bullish until stocks are a lot higher. I prefer what I consider to be lower risk entries, at lower levels.
215 2018-03-26 22:27:06 Right - when you predicted stocks to plunge after Trump's election. Give me a break you and your so called specialist don't have a clue. Just a fake rag.
216 2018-03-26 22:27:05 I remember when fundamentals made stocks move not @CNBC "analysts" $mu
217 2018-03-26 22:26:46 No meio de uma discussão dizer que também é importante discutir alargamento de horário de acessibilidade e rupturas de stocks, não é alarmista. E eu nem tenho qualquer empatia com a bastonária.
218 2018-03-26 22:26:45 The sentiment shift came too late for European stocks. Although industrial commodities rallied, further gains for gold sounded a warning note @MicMcCarthy_CMC
219 2018-03-26 22:26:24 I’m  happy that POTUS is banning bump stocks however I remain  disappointed that POTUS is avoiding disrupting the NRA status quo and not standing up for the youth movement & the majority of Americans who want more sensible gun control
220 2018-03-26 22:26:18 But he also signed legislation legalizing bump stocks. Congress is a very convenient excuse. There are executive orders and other ways around a reluctant congress.
221 2018-03-26 22:26:10 Great feedback @AgriGoode. Thank You. We have good stocks available of Sardi 10 Series 2 Lucerne this year too.

225 2018-03-26 22:25:33 U.S. stocks are coming off the biggest weekly decline in more than two years, and the aftermath of that drop has market technicians warning that major indexes are on the verge of a full-fledged, technical breakdown.

universal background checks
ban weapon sales to those on terrorist no-fly list
COMMON SENSE TO LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS!!!
231 2018-03-26 22:23:05 Right...thus the civilian version. Bump stocks should have already been banned but none of it has any place on our streets.
232 2018-03-26 22:21:56 One reason the stock market has been doing so well is because the economies of other countries are growing, which also helps our economy (not just stocks). No more globalism? Good luck with that.

237 2018-03-26 22:18:00 bump stocks are toys, 100rd magazines are unreliable, background checks are unenforceable.
238 2018-03-26 22:17:31 I thought the #StopSchoolViolenceAct was already passed and bump stocks banned?
239 2018-03-26 22:17:24 unlike crypto, a rising tide does not always lift all boats. i'm more cautious about dead stocks than I am dead crypto's.
240 2018-03-26 22:15:58 WOW! Funny how you just ignored all of last week. You know this one: The stock market dropped 6% last week, its worst week since January 2016, leaving stocks down 10% from January high. Edward Jones 3/23/18
241 2018-03-26 22:15:56 Come back from failure, don’t run away from it
242 2018-03-26 22:15:34 Thanks for answering my question.. what is it then when you have prior knowledge or influence and use it to buy or in this case sell stocks? I am not being sarcastic I really want to know..TIA

249 2018-03-26 22:10:23 Registering all guns above a certain power level. Ban accessories such as bump stocks and magazines of more than 5 rounds. License users at different levels for different types of guns. Increase money for enforcement of all existing regulations.

252 2018-03-26 22:08:27 Great news for the 13 percent of Americans who own 85 percent of the stocks! Not so much for the average hard working American
253 2018-03-26 22:08:15 I agree that this issue is too important to treat as a partisan one. I support  rational gun rights, but I also think that we need better background checks for all gun purchases. No guns for violent or mentally ill persons. Age s/b raised to 21 and bump stocks outlawed plus more.
254 2018-03-26 22:06:44 Shootings don’t just happen from mentally ill people and a gun doesn’t shoot itself. Start fixing bullying and other issues in ur own schools. Let’s hit some realistic goals such as outlawing the bump stocks like the President DID, and other such things.
255 2018-03-26 22:06:19 Lord. My virus takes 2-3 weeks to grow to a decent titer and then separate naked vs envelope virions - which reduced my yield like 100 fold. And I have to make new stocks twice a month.

258 2018-03-26 22:05:57 This might hurt your little brain, but we are NOT calling for a ban on all guns. Just certain styles of guns and attachments like bump stocks and silencers (which Drumpf wants to legalize). Not hand guns, shotguns, hunting rifles (as long as they’re not semi-automatic)
259 2018-03-26 22:05:30 Why are my stocks down then ?
260 2018-03-26 22:05:22 What is an assault weapon? Anything can be an "assault weapon", Trump banned bump stocks btw.
261 2018-03-26 22:04:15 it appears to only work in one direction, stocks up @realDonaldTrump is the cause, all other outcomes, like any other messes, not his fault.
262 2018-03-26 22:03:50 You might be surprised! Who made good use of the stocks?
263 2018-03-26 22:03:39 The problem with the bump stock ban is it partially restored to us what was lost through the passing of the hughes amendment. I realize bump stocks are not practical for much but its what they represent.
264 2018-03-26 22:03:22 Bloomberg headline is telling us about best jump in stocks since 2015 but that is just rise in volatility or more precisely - rise in fractal dimension ratio - moves are stretching along time and price scales.
265 2018-03-26 22:02:41 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
266 2018-03-26 22:02:29 Yes, bump stocks were approved by the tag under the obummer  administration..like it or not it's a fact snowflake.
267 2018-03-26 22:00:42 We named our firm Thunderstorm Capital because a thunderstorm is a frightening but temporary event... In constructing our portfolios, we try to invest in good companies whose stocks are depressed by frightening but temporary bad news. - John Dorfman
268 2018-03-26 22:00:41 Yes I saw these the other day. I think if they made them vegan I'd probably buy a share of their stocks no lie
269 2018-03-26 22:00:36 Check each of their Lockheed stocks
270 2018-03-26 22:00:15 Donald Trump publicly celebrating stocks for having a good day while still being at a loss overall is the perfect representation of modern politics in the US.
271 2018-03-26 22:00:06 Zack is correct and this Turkey idiot is, well...an idiot!!! 
A correction is a 10% decline in stocks from a recent high. 
A correction is less severe than a bear market, when stocks decline 20% from their recent highs.
272 2018-03-26 22:00:04 My short lived pool career has finally come to an end. What an 8 weeks it has been, absolute roller coaster of emotion. But one double defeat by man and wife has done me, time to pack up the magic stick. Thanks to everyone involved along the way
273 2018-03-26 21:59:52 Há rotura de stocks sim!! Já me aconteceu com a vacina da tosse convulsa qd estive grávida o ano passado. #pec
274 2018-03-26 21:59:42 Wow, this is great news for people that own stocks on the Dow? For the rest of the people, it’s not gonna help.
275 2018-03-26 21:59:35 Can we write a bill that takes all the money invested in us as stocks and gives it back to us?
276 2018-03-26 21:59:35 Hmmm why no comment on the historic drops recently? BTW stocks and shares etc mean nothing to the majority of regular citizens. In touch with the people? I don't think so.
277 2018-03-26 21:58:13 Can any one recommend me some dividend stocks on the american side?
278 2018-03-26 21:58:05 Don't kid yourself if the alt-right extremist gets power they would take your gun just as fast! The alt-right  are well armed, anti-government authoritarians! Having large stocks of guns is actually a threat to democracy when in the hands of fascist or communist revolutionary!
279 2018-03-26 21:57:02 Make sure u read the currently passed gun bill and understand how bump stocks work. I realize ppl are emotionally wound up but no decision should be made without reading facts.
280 2018-03-26 21:56:53 @mattfrei    Your govt propaganda film on BBC2  only lacked a few vital details......    WHAT killed the Schipols ,  where is it & who made it...#new USA budget has allocated $916Million to destroy chemical weapons STOCKS....& the UK......Ahhh!!! military secret !!!!!
281 2018-03-26 21:56:51 Did you know Best Buy revenue and stocks have been trending up since 2013? About time to share the $$; why not a substantial wage increase?

284 2018-03-26 21:56:30 NRA supports sale of mega-magazines, armor-piercing bullets, bump stocks, criminals buying guns,  unregulated gun shows, no background checks and don’t forget buying politicians with Russian money.  It’s that bunch you are defending.  I back the sane kids.
285 2018-03-26 21:56:24 Dow up almost 700. I thought stocks were supposed to crash this week
286 2018-03-26 21:56:10 Make sure u read the currently passed gun bill and understand how bump stocks work. I realize ppl are emotionally wound up but no decision should be made without reading facts.
287 2018-03-26 21:55:52 It's called "covering short positions" -- If @realDonaldTrump knew a thing or two about #Finance (and not just scamming people), he'd know about shorting stocks. There will be a spike while short positions are being covered, then... back down the #StockMarket goes!
288 2018-03-26 21:55:44 Some of the comments were funny. But if there's anything that's likely to happen it might be ban bump stocks. Not much else. & if that restriction is passed then National Reciprocity might follow as a compromise. Be careful what is wished for... :)
289 2018-03-26 21:55:42 LOL Bitcoin was once something you could get a few of easily. $GVT is that now. I could very well see $GVT end up on @coinbase considering they are a platform for investing in crypto, forex, and stocks and they're underpromising and overdelivering left and right. wonderful!

291 2018-03-26 21:55:41 What is a Mutual Fund?
A Mutual Fund is an investment company that “pools” together the money of many people (investors) to buy the stocks and bonds of a WIDE range of companieS or 
fixed income securitieS
292 2018-03-26 21:55:21 Any eplay stocks that are on the exchanges that have the potential of becoming a pure play with tv broadcasts licenses hosting events in stadiums etc
293 2018-03-26 21:55:19 My three faves are “Death in the Stocks” (love Antonia) and the two novels with Terrible Timothy Harte (“They Found Him Dead” and “Duplicate Death”) because I (cough cough) love revisiting characters.
294 2018-03-26 21:55:14 You're right Zack. Only the reflection of the economy. When that's down Stocks are down. When it goes up the stocks go up. Live and learn.
295 2018-03-26 21:54:47 Sink Concealed Carry Reciprocity

Ban bump stocks and other modifications to convert semi-automatic rifles into de facto fully-automatic weapons
Keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers
296 2018-03-26 21:53:20 Can you please add options to seggregate portfolio and watchlist - by sector, groups, P/L, etc? Right now it's just a list of stocks one after the other - with no grouping.
297 2018-03-26 21:53:19 don’t give any support for my dreams and goals they just tell me to go to school and get a stable job, instead of investing in stocks they tell me to get a student loan, instead of wanting my happiness they want me to look good for other people, people they are trying to impress.
298 2018-03-26 21:53:13 Thanks trump for my loses in my stocks. Fuck trump
299 2018-03-26 21:53:05 dude STOP TALKING POLITICS AND BS at work " bump stocks make guns fun why did trump sign that shit " let me eat in peace plz fuck shut up i hate you
300 2018-03-26 21:52:27 I knew somehow you were going to fuck up the stocks. Thanks again. I miss Obama
301 2018-03-26 21:52:22 They have said over and over they aren't trying to do that--they're trying to establish universal background checks, ban assault weapons & bump stocks, & make it harder for criminals to get guns. C'mon. Support these kids! They're leading America with dignity & patriotism!
302 2018-03-26 21:52:09 He banned bump stocks. This proves you did not watch or listen. Your agenda is to bash him. He is doing what the marchers are asking for, before they marched. Another uneducated lib.
303 2018-03-26 21:51:28 Bruh I invested on an app called Robinhood in weed stocks in Canada for 9 dollars a share. It’s at like 7 now but it’s that easy. Also nothing’s stopping you or anyone not white to start a business just like anyone in America has the ability to and does
304 2018-03-26 21:50:15 Yea I don’t see blue chip stocks needing to advertise to invest in them.  I have regulation but this isn’t regulation this is stopping the BS scams
305 2018-03-26 21:50:13 Stocks Jump in Best Day Since 2015 !!! #WallStreet
306 2018-03-26 21:50:05 your definition of volatility  cannot be applied to cryptocurrency. can u project such scenario happened to real life currency. i paid 1 litecoin for 1 apple.n you turn around the price is now worth a playstation. litecoin is an investement like stocks. it cannot be used as money
307 2018-03-26 21:50:01 This is because watching A.I. supercomputers trade stocks every 5 microseconds is hard work, they deserve huge bonuses
308 2018-03-26 21:49:04 Thats fine 
yeh Some characters just have problem removing stocks
309 2018-03-26 21:49:00 #vergefam: why are the stupidest heads always the loudest?

- compare #Vergecurrency with a company and stocks

@tokenpay seems to be the only hope....
310 2018-03-26 21:48:56 Which stocks do you invest in?
311 2018-03-26 21:48:39 Bonsoir! Le niveau des stocks peut varier au cours d’une même journée pour différentes raisons : un arrivage de nouveaux produits, un retour accepté par notre service de qualité ou un client qui n’aurait pas validé sa commande après avoir mis l’article dans son panier
312 2018-03-26 21:48:01 Those si stocks ? 
313 2018-03-26 21:47:43 How many in your base have stocks??? Their surprise will come when that minute amount you gave them back this year will have to be paid back, plus more, next year.
Oh Stormy
314 2018-03-26 21:47:38 I’m not wealthy but my ira acct and my stocks have skyrocketed!  Thank You President Trump!
315 2018-03-26 21:46:55 Just remember you never responded to the #MarchForOurLives ignorant demands.
How exactly will banning bump stocks even make a difference?
It won't!
Knock yourselves out!
There will forever be another shooter!
You'll NEVER legislative crazy...and
#LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
316 2018-03-26 21:46:52 All your friends bought back the stocks they sold off the other day.  They are manipulating the stock market. The middle class is not in on the deal.
317 2018-03-26 21:46:22 My stocks are down by $ thousands since Feb. I blame YOU.
318 2018-03-26 21:46:00 Monday's 670 point (+2.8%) rally was the biggest gain seen in the Dow since 26 August 2015, 649 trading days earlier, and was the biggest rally on a Monday in the 337 weeks since 10 October 2011 #stocks
319 2018-03-26 21:45:55 @smartertrader great for chinese stocks.... $baba, $bidu
320 2018-03-26 21:45:41 Then what timeline should we set for the stocks? If not a year?
321 2018-03-26 21:45:24 Because as @delaneytarr herself said, “We’re not here for breadcrumbs” - you want credit to be acknowledged for something which alone solves next to nothing. Stopping bump stocks is a consolation prize, and anyone who isn’t drinking the NRA koolaid can see that  #sorrynotsorry
322 2018-03-26 21:45:16 What's he looking for? Specific muzzle velocity or rounds per minute? His point about firearm ignorance is only valid in it's relation to common sense gun control. Legislation needs details on ammo types, mag capacity, background checks, bump stocks, etc. It's fix A2, not repeal!
323 2018-03-26 21:44:58 It depends on who you talk to to some common sense is raising the age for buying a gun, new laws & regulation on mental health, banning bump stocks, more security guards on school campus’s, and even allowing administrators & teachers to be armed. Others say that’s not enough.
324 2018-03-26 21:44:53 He banned bump stocks. Tell me what Obama Did? Nothing.  Now jsut like everything else Obama didn't do it's Trumps fault. You can't make it up. Russian meddling. OBAMA let it happen not Trump. He isn't even given a chance to try to fix it before he's bashed.  It's old.
325 2018-03-26 21:44:36 Is the specific effort to ban bump stocks a result of the lack of knowledge about guns?

You don't need extensive knowledge about the categories of guns in order to acknowledge the culture of violence permeated by a number of factors, including the widespread availability of guns
326 2018-03-26 21:44:12 The bump stock green light received approval from the ATF during the Obama administration. The Obama administration authorized bump stocks.
327 2018-03-26 21:43:41 Your wall is not going to stop the gun violence against our schools. Be a hero in the US and ban assault weapons, bump stocks, large bullet capacity magazines and armor piecing bullets!! Will cost nothing but typing s piece of paper and ur stupid signature!!
328 2018-03-26 21:43:18 Dan will you define build. Is it a stocks typical volume on say a ten minute chart when increased interest arises? Is it Volume Profile.
329 2018-03-26 21:42:45 Yea i was hoping for a pure esports play so u havent found one?
330 2018-03-26 21:42:34 Pension funds put a significant portion of their money in company stocks and bonds. That’s trillions of dollars.
331 2018-03-26 21:42:06 You are right. I can move it out of stocks but, unfortunately, many of us rely on the earnings we make on our stocks to live. If I move to safer harbors there’s much less income to pay the bills. Then you start using more of your principal and run out of money too soon.#Catch22
332 2018-03-26 21:41:51 You also hear a lot about gun reform.  Overwhelming majorities support univ. background checks, restrictions on those with domestic violence histories, bans on bump stocks.  A growing substantial majority also want the AR15 banned.  But the NRA pays you not to listen.
333 2018-03-26 21:41:05 Techs and Banks! US stocks sharply higher; Dow up 650 points up! facebook going down the drain.
334 2018-03-26 21:40:12 Fuck I just remembered stocks is for boys and class is for straight people
335 2018-03-26 21:38:03 I give him credit for this and I give him credit for making the right choice to ban bump stocks.
336 2018-03-26 21:37:28 Lol - stock prices are based on sentiment not fundamentals.

It is not unusual to see highly valued stocks implode and go bankrupt very rapidly.
337 2018-03-26 21:37:18 Good night! I hope the #crypto world and my #stocks will have a greener day tomorrow 
338 2018-03-26 21:37:11 So let's discuss gun laws, since that's really the issue. What's your take on banning assault weapons, universal background checks, banning bump stocks, limiting size of clips, keeping guns away from certain people who have known mental issues or have restraining orders issued?
339 2018-03-26 21:36:46 What stocks did she make plummet?
340 2018-03-26 21:36:22 You can move it out of stocks, just can't spend it without paying taxes on it. I think you can move it into anything in your 401K choices
341 2018-03-26 21:36:18 Stocks plunge on threats of your stupid tariffs; stocks soar on talk of compromise. So you get credit and blame. Which would you prefer? If credit, cut out the trade nonsense.

353 2018-03-26 21:33:23 She most certainly is not trying to change the Constitution. They all want AR15 ban, universal background checks and ban on bump stocks. That is no way changing the Constitution. Their lives are more important than the above mentioned. All these attacks against her is fear based.
354 2018-03-26 21:33:06 U.S. stocks are coming off the biggest weekly decline  in more than two years, a fall that has market technicians arguing that  major indexes are on the verge of a full-fledged, technical breakdown.
355 2018-03-26 21:32:33 The NRA hatred is such a joke. This is an organization in a free country that lobbies for what they believe in. Better mental health. Common sense background checks so crazies can’t get guns.  Eliminate bump stocks. Limit magazines. Enforce curr laws.
356 2018-03-26 21:32:29 Real estate and stocks will retire you faster than anything else...
357 2018-03-26 21:32:13 What Next the for grip or a scope I mean this is a slippery slope you are going down Mr.President & bump stocks does not change the gun most gun owners hate bump stocks they are a Item for a joke so banning is just dumb just leave the rest of our guns alone PLEASE..

361 2018-03-26 21:31:13 Jowy, honey…stocks were down bigly last week, this doesn't even make up for half of the losses last week. You really, really should stop constantly making a fool of yourself.
362 2018-03-26 21:30:37 Don't you have a KKK rally to attend or Tiki Torches to light! In other words shut up and get off my thread you ___________________________________!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Just remember those famous bump stocks when Ole Sessions bans them!!!

LOL
363 2018-03-26 21:30:26 Except that all those things are very useful for defending against home invaders.

FYI, a rifle does no damage whatsoever.  Folding stocks, pistol grips, etc. do not make a rifle bullet any more effective.
364 2018-03-26 21:30:17 U.S. stocks closed sharply higher on Monday, with major indexes posting their best day in years as concerns about a potential trade war between China and the United States appeared to wane.

369 2018-03-26 21:29:15 @realDonaldTrump I'm stupefied by your actions kicking out Russians with not one shred of proof by UK, no independent investigation, and disregarding fact US & others present when Russia destroyed gas stocks
370 2018-03-26 21:28:54 I mean it's gotta have something to do with Iron Maidens, right?

Or racks, or something?

Stocks! Because you can do that publicly!
371 2018-03-26 21:28:11 tout le monde se jette sur la Russie cela ressemble à une grande manipulation. Il y a avait des stocks de ces produits dans divers états de l'ex URSS. Le refus d'enquêtes avec les Russes comme en Syrie est particulièrement suspects.

375 2018-03-26 21:26:25 STOCKS:  Huge pressure on GOP/Wall STREET/Trump to prop up stocks this week.   They do not want stocks to show a loss in 1st quarter after the republican TAX CUTS for BILLIONAIRES.  Good time to sell into rallies to reduce stock exposure.  @DNC @TheDemCoalition @TheDemocrats
376 2018-03-26 21:26:22 tomorrow happened, it would inevitably be far worse for us to ban rifles if we prohibit say detachable stocks or collapsing to under 32” and 30rd maximum, then if we banned them and gave people pistols. Ultimately it would save 100, and kill 3,000 more, which isn’t the goal I ho
377 2018-03-26 21:26:15 You know what you're I don't know shit stocks, I'll just sit here at the park watching my kids play. Because I'm already done hitting my profit margin for today. Peace time to play with the kids.
378 2018-03-26 21:26:14 Look HP. I don’t trust the company. I have contacts that told me to stay away. Too many other good stocks out there. I’ve tried to tell you. Good luck
379 2018-03-26 21:26:07 I’m not saying that mental health shouldn’t be a important focus. 96 people die every day at the hand of a gun, most of them suicides. But we need to look at banning assault weapons, bump stocks, raising the purchase age and keeping guns out of the hands of domestic abusers.
380 2018-03-26 21:25:13 Stocks took biggest plunge in a two year last week! My IRA lost huge!  Today, it gains tiny, tiny ! Is that a great news? I don’t think so! So bad!!
381 2018-03-26 21:25:10 You seem to have forgotten to take credit for a few days where we lost a TON of money in stocks.
382 2018-03-26 21:24:58 They should have argued that they should not be regulated, then they would be right. The president has no such authority to ban bump stocks, it's completely unconstitutional. "Arms" means more than just guns.

384 2018-03-26 21:23:46 Where were ur Tweets over the past weeks...even the past 2days when Stocks dropped over 1100pts? U LUV 2 gloat over HIGHS in the Market but NEVER when they drop like a hammer!! Is this just more #TrumpDeflection? U can't have it BOTH WAYS.
385 2018-03-26 21:22:56 Yep I understand but then again I dont think stormy Daniels Is relevant to what is going on with this country. Does the mainstream media care that the tariffs are already working and only a week later. Stocks up today.
386 2018-03-26 21:22:55 So, when the stock market climbs you take credit, but when it drops you're silent. Last week the market had its biggest decline in the last 2 years, & it was due to your tariffs & trade wars. The only reason the market was up today was because investors were buying cheap stocks.
387 2018-03-26 21:22:54 I highly recommend Defense stocks in this trading environment. Follow the money. Largest defense budget in history just passed last week $700bil! What else do u need to know?
388 2018-03-26 21:21:49 I served 7 years in the Marine Corps and have a combat deployment under my belt. I agree that automatic weapons shouldnt be had by regular civilians but anyone who says they are is lying, they've been illegal for a very long time. Bump stocks are being pushed to be made illegal 2
389 2018-03-26 21:21:28 yes they are like useless stocks = ) im not here to provoke u or any thing. but lets be real here. 99.9% of litecoin investors want to get rich out of litecoin. please get real and dont say otherwise.....dont say things like because i buy LTC because i believe in the technology..

394 2018-03-26 21:18:20 Most Americans don’t own a gun of any sort. Probably overwhelmed by different types. I have friends who hunt, former military and they all believe we need to reduce the availability of automatic weapons and bump stocks, eliminate gun show loopholes. Something’s gotta change.
395 2018-03-26 21:17:45 As an Army vet I support a ban on bump stocks and assault weapons! No civilian should have access to those unless they plan on killing people! They are weapons of war!

398 2018-03-26 21:17:02 So nobody wants to ban AR-15s, Bump Stocks, Assault Rifles, ect? You say we should look at the UK, which will not allow any citizens to even own handguns. Not saying it'll be today, but alot of these people want to go down a path where there are no guns.

401 2018-03-26 21:15:54 Only someone who’s never fired a fully automatic weapon would think that bump stocks matter. Any increase in rate of fire is immediately negated by the detriment to anything resembling accuracy. “Spray and pray” is a term for a reason

411 2018-03-26 21:14:18 Come on fatman, there was no law at the time to prohibit bump stocks and that time just happened to be during Obama's terms.  It's not like he personally legalized them.

489 2018-03-26 20:58:54 These marches aren't about gun bans. Do you even know why they march? They want assault weapons (Military Weapons used in WAR AND COMBAT) and bump stocks banned. NOBODY needs a semi automatic weapon, even if it's used for hunting or not, you don't need one. Period.
490 2018-03-26 20:58:22 Since the Prohibition era gangsters stated using Tommy Guns, the line was set at full automatic. Anything that fired more than one bullet with one trigger pull required hard to get Federal license

496 2018-03-26 20:55:46 1. If the background checks are so strong, how did these people slip through the cracks
2. How will that ban be ineffective if experts conclude that semi-automatic rifles with bump stocks could fire hundreds of rounds per minute, according to experts.

510 2018-03-26 20:52:50 Dude you have got to be kidding me, 1, you can get both, 2 bump stocks and other customization turns the “semi” into a fully automatic weapon which it already was based upon purchase. Can’t tell me an AR isn’t automatic. If so you haven’t shot one. They would light up a crowd
511 2018-03-26 20:52:08 I looked at moving my next appointment to an earlier date but there are zero spaces available. I am B- which you are shouting out for but I can’t get in.
I know you can only fit in so many each session but with stocks being so low, can you make extra spaces available?
512 2018-03-26 20:52:07 Zuck is in deep and sold Millions of his stocks ahead of time before news broke. Google actually made a move last year to flag results certain sites like @infowars et al so this has indeed been a trend & they are just following orders.  It's a bigger problem. Use @DuckDuckGo :)
513 2018-03-26 20:52:02 Free alcohol and bump stocks welcomed.
514 2018-03-26 20:51:45 "Fewer than 19% of taxpayers own stocks.
The largest chunk of the workforce owns zero stock.
About 50% of Americans have nothing in a 401(k)
There’s been no wage boom
Most of the tax cuts went to stock buybacks
Millionaires have an 88% participation rate"
How about #MAGAForAll ??
515 2018-03-26 20:51:03 Stocks that companies own because they are buying them all back with your tax break. This doesn't mean anything to majority of the American people.... SMH
516 2018-03-26 20:51:02 @MarketWatch  U.S. stocks are coming off the biggest weekly decline  in more than two years, a fall that has market technicians arguing that  major indexes are on the verge of a full-fledged, technical breakdown.

526 2018-03-26 20:48:21 So why wouldn’t you want to have restrictions on an AR-15 or bump stocks or restrictions on private sales? Wouldn’t all those things not pertain to you? You would agree these things are unnecessary, no?
527 2018-03-26 20:47:49 Lololol. Dude! It lost over a thousand just last week. Anyhow this is most meaningful to people who have stocks like Mitt Romney and your swamp rats. Avg American needs wage increase. Your tax scam: $200B in one time bonuses, $800B in stock buyback. And STILL the market fell.
528 2018-03-26 20:47:25 Easy day trading. Mnuchin and Liu He had a meeting, so you know stocks would recover $$$

548 2018-03-26 20:43:05 Dow is up over 650 points today but still down after large losses last week, highlighting the challenges of trying to predict short term stock moves. Stick to your long term plans, diversify, and keep fees in check.

553 2018-03-26 20:41:58 Just when I think you can’t get any more stupid you go ahead and comment on a one day gain in stocks. When it was  down 700 pts. in a day and 1000 pts. for the week you had nothing to say. JUST STOP!

556 2018-03-26 20:41:16 That's the definition for "assault rifle", not "assault weapon" which is term arbitrarily designating random tactical/scary parts as super dangerous. ie: telescoping stocks, pistol grips, flash hiders, barrel shrouds, etc
557 2018-03-26 20:41:01 Love how @djvlad is always telling folks about stocks. Dude legit cares about people bettering themselves and their situations. Don't see that a lot...especially in the hip-hop world.
558 2018-03-26 20:40:51 Oh so now you talk about stocks. Hey loser boy. they go up and down. big news. Maybe you guys should stop insider trading first.
559 2018-03-26 20:40:51 They need to inforce all the laws already on the books. They need law enforcement to follow the laws and do their jobs. Don't care if they eliminate bump stocks. But don't  touch the guns. If all people were as reasonable as you sound there would be more cooperation.

569 2018-03-26 20:38:06 …So what’s next? The good news: Over the long haul, stocks prices follow earnings and #earnings are still going up. They are expected to grow 21% this year and another 11% in 2019. #Growth is a tailwind that can forgive many sins.
570 2018-03-26 20:38:03 Well they generated 300 million cash from operations. 35 million net cash increase. But most of the profit is attributable to increase in asset value apparently. The stocks they hold

572 2018-03-26 20:37:30 Oh I get it. When the Dow has the largest drop in history twice in a week then stocks don’t matter. But when it goes up a bit once then it’s a sign that trump is our savior...
573 2018-03-26 20:37:05 I don't use a scanner for washes.  I just look for them on stocks I've already been watching

577 2018-03-26 20:36:43 You only seem to tweet about things that benefit you, sir. Where were you claiming responsibility when the stocks take a tumble?
578 2018-03-26 20:36:37 Yea, because after you started your trade war the market tanked and now its recovering. A lot of stocks are still down.
579 2018-03-26 20:36:19 Dude is unbelievable... stocks down non stop and don’t hear a peep and day it’s up he tweets. Takes credit for anything that goes well and never his fault.  I’m so proud he’s our president!  Great character.  He’s so humble
580 2018-03-26 20:36:00 Jesus, you’re actually taking credit for the stock market recovering-on it’s own- after you tried your best to fuck it up? 
For those who didn’t read the whole article: 
“Stocks closed sharply higher on Monday, bouncing back from strong losses in the previous session“
581 2018-03-26 20:35:13 Btw Dems, I ain't selling my stocks. You can if you REALLY believe the market is on the brink of disaster. Stupid move, but what can be expected of stupid people?
582 2018-03-26 20:34:40 So are u opposed to banning bump-stocks?
583 2018-03-26 20:33:54 Stocks tried to make up for last week's misery in one day.  After falling 5.7% over the last 5 trading days, the Dow rallied 2.84%, or 669 pts.  Not to be out done, the Nasdaq tacked on 3.26%, or 228 pts; the S&P lagged - up a mere 2.72%, or 70 pts. Best Dow day since Aug 2015.
584 2018-03-26 20:33:46 The sad reality is that utility tokens at least *could* have value.

What regulation specifically?

592 2018-03-26 20:31:16 After a record day in stocks, here's the headline from LIBERAL Wall Street:

"Dow’s 670-point surge belies fact that stock market is on the brink of an absolute breakdown!"

Too funny.
593 2018-03-26 20:31:11 Today's rally will make for good media headlines, but there was little substance behind it.  Majority of stocks bounced on low volume as the market works of oversold conditions.  Expect more back and forth in the coming weeks as we try to form a bottom.
594 2018-03-26 20:30:36 Bump stocks were discussed because the media thought that the public didn't know about them and it made for an sensational headline. The problem is that in order to define what a bump stock is in general law term so far has included thing that you can do without a bump stock.

599 2018-03-26 20:28:52 Witnessing the powers that be try to “control” ICOs somehow is laughable really. Most Americans are already excluded from participating in most ICOs anyway. In reality this is nothing more than the establishment getting freaked out about stocks and bonds being turned into tokens.

609 2018-03-26 20:21:54 Bro you are talking like we are referring to stocks lost or business losses incurred. We are talking about lives. We cannot be patient with that. Every single life is too important for the patience you preach

621 2018-03-26 20:18:02 (AP) - Stocks have surged higher today as the market recovers more of its huge losses from last week. Investors are encouraged by signs that the U.S. and China are open to negotiating in hopes of averting a trade dispute. Indexes post best percentage gains since 2015. #WLKY
622 2018-03-26 20:17:51 STOCKS:  This week we will hear stocks are a good investment.

633 2018-03-26 20:13:38 I like your commentary of a third party, Trump was the only person that could have made it happen. Unfortunately the executive order on bump stocks makes Trumps record with gun control worse than Obama's. The single issue voters in the midwest will never rally behind him for it.

638 2018-03-26 20:12:19 Hilarious that people are happy about this. It’s totally hollow: this is all of the opportunist investors swooping in to buy stocks at reduced prices, and most are going to dump them for the quick gain, causing another big drop in a couple of days. But the MAGA heads knew that 
639 2018-03-26 20:11:19 Is SWING MACHINE CLAIRVOYANT.......we warned our PRIVATE MEMBERS that the S and P could be up 68 points........we had wrong mkt....

643 2018-03-26 20:10:21 Stocks up, USD down, Treasuries down, Oil down. We have not seen panic in 2018 and this is no euphoria yet.
644 2018-03-26 20:10:11 US Stocks reverse Friday's losses; rest of world weak : US +2.7%; Europe -.7%. Trade war fears oscillated lower & spurred US rally. Investors should be wary as Trump's next trade tweet could send fear soaring. More long-term your horizon, more dips are buying opportunities.

652 2018-03-26 20:08:15 Current Market status remains "Uptrend under Pressure". Friday was ugly! That said, I sold select growth stocks into todays unexpected strength and continued to raise cash. Will $GLD and $KL breakout to the upside. Both held up well today.

660 2018-03-26 20:05:55 Stocks surge, regaining some of last week's losses. The Dow closed at 24,202.60, up 669.40 (+2.84%). Nasdaq +3.26%. S&P +2.72%.
661 2018-03-26 20:05:55 And Obama made bump stocks legal.

Why is that? 

Why did OBAMA make bump stocks legal?

Did his team want tragedy to happen...to give his team cause to empower gun control?

Heck, they fund Planned Parenthood. A few more lives lost is nothing to them..

663 2018-03-26 20:05:11 Bump stocks banned themselves by costing almost $300 per minute to operate. It is something most owners really don’t want. This is similar to banning all Ford Edsel’s.

676 2018-03-26 20:02:11 Of course laws are useful. I have family in the military&sheriff/police so I respect laws. There is such a thing as having too many laws. For argument sake, let’s say we ban bump stocks, go ahead. That won’t really have an impact and wouldn’t have prevented the Parkland shooting.
677 2018-03-26 20:01:44 Stocks had their best day since 2015. This is what happens when the president is banging pornstars and playmates nonstop. Markets rip.
678 2018-03-26 20:01:33 This is not Fake - Stocks sold off on the two occasions so far this year when Trump announced new tariffs—the steel and aluminum tariffs he announced March 8, and a broader set of tariffs against Chinese imports announced March 22

682 2018-03-26 20:00:52 How management communicates mistakes is very important. No one is mistake-free - as investors 40% of the stocks we buy underperform the market - and I'd be concerned about any company where shareholder communication doesn't include a candid assessment of mistakes. - Bill Nygren
683 2018-03-26 20:00:42 Trump has tweeted about the stock market 47 times since being elected, taking credit for the gains. He hasn’t tweeted on the stock market lately. His silence of late makes sense: stocks have been volatile and are slightly negative for the year—in part because of Trump himself.

687 2018-03-26 19:59:49 Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Friday announced a proposed rule to ban so-called bump stocks that allow semi-automatic guns to fire more rapidly, similar to a fully automatic weapon. Even Jeff the racist Sessions believes or caved to pressure

689 2018-03-26 19:59:13 Dems had control of congress the first 2 years of Obamas presidency. They didn't do anything about gun control except approve bump stocks. Ask yourself why that is. If they could pass Obamacare, then why no gun control? The GOP didn't have the votes to block it.Any ideas on that?
690 2018-03-26 19:58:15 US stocks in strong rally. Down 5.6% last week, back up 3% today. #Whee
691 2018-03-26 19:57:54 President Trump has already done more on this horrible problem than any other president in 10 years!  Out lawing bump stocks, giving schools more security and more to come!
692 2018-03-26 19:57:53 And we who subscribe to the idea are doing so more out of fear than confidence. What happens if we don't pay? If we don't like debt? If our credit scores aren't good enough? If we all pull our stocks, or ask for all our money that isn't in the banks because they loaned it all?
693 2018-03-26 19:57:40 My sense is it is:
Ban high capacity magazines, close gun show loopholes, ban bump stocks federally, 21 to buy a gun, reinstall the assault weapons ban (there used to be  one and gun violence went down), beef up mentally ill gun laws, no armed teachers.
694 2018-03-26 19:57:38 Grains & Livestock closed lower.  Talk of trade tensions easing sent US stocks sharply higher. Gold higher. US Dollar & Crude, Copper all lower today.
695 2018-03-26 19:57:17 Dow Jones Industrial Average surges 600+ points, erasing more of the ground lost last week, led by big gains in tech stocks and banks.
696 2018-03-26 19:57:10 #Grains & Livestock closed lower.  Talk of trade tensions easing sent US #stocks sharply higher. Gold higher. US Dollar & Crude, Copper all lower today.
697 2018-03-26 19:57:10 End of conversation. Parkland was due to an idiot with a gun. How on earth is taking 14 x AR-15 rifles (twelve of which had bump stocks and 100-round magazines), eight AR-10 rifles, a bolt-action rifle, and a revolver into a hotel room over a period of days a "spontaneous event"?

704 2018-03-26 19:56:28 The S&P 500 is stil negative for the year. Earnings growth is going to be 15 or 20 pct due to tax cuts. If he just stays out of the way, stocks should go much higher this year.
705 2018-03-26 19:56:08 This is comparable to John Schneiter, the ex-CEO/Founder of Papa John's claiming that his company's stocks were suffering because of their partnership with the NFL and the whole "taking a knee" at the anthem bit, even though Pizza Hut and Dominoes said their stocks were up
706 2018-03-26 19:55:58 1: Bump stocks could be regulated in the same regard, or close to, as full auto even though you don't need a bump stock to 'bump stock'.

2: Maybe private sales through FLDs at no cost.

3: Fact
707 2018-03-26 19:55:58 Bump stocks are a joke and my guess is most that purchased one don't use it.

765 2018-03-26 19:37:59 true, but it could help prevent some suicides and mass shootings. plus, i don’t believe taking EVERYONE’s guns away is the solution; better background checks, ban bump stocks, regulate storage and set a limit on the number of firearms someone can own without sufficient reason
766 2018-03-26 19:37:34 I know that, but these stocks move off the prints, regardless of the option trade
767 2018-03-26 19:37:27 I know I saw this and liked it earlier but I came across it again just now and read “socks” instead of “stocks” 
768 2018-03-26 19:37:18 Well nvm. They're actually speaking now but about stocks. Idk much about Fox programming (gag me again) but this program could be business related, idk. But I've checked the channel 5 times and each time, it was commercials.
769 2018-03-26 19:36:02 I myself fall more center left, that being said I find that ALL OF OUR AMENDMENTS are sacred to our rights.  However, probably don't need 100 round mags and bump stocks.
770 2018-03-26 19:35:59 2. Let’s say we went with Kurt on this.. if there were a parkland style shooting, everyday, for a month.. would you tell the victims and the families that we got bump stocks and drum magazines banned. Plus, Uni-background checks. Or would you say WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING!
771 2018-03-26 19:35:45 One opinion. IMHO, bump stocks aren't enough. There's a big space between all and none. I'm a left leaning independent and a gun owner and will defend the Constitution. 

Some, not all. Better legislation.

773 2018-03-26 19:35:11 Private prisons operate like football teams or some shit. They have sponsors and everything. People can buy shares in them which isn’t surprising because prison system are billion dollar/Fortune 500 companies. Their stocks went up 100% after Trump won the election.

779 2018-03-26 19:34:23 Bump stocks are a gimmick that waste ammo and make the weapon highly inaccurate. The Vegas shooter would have been just as effective pulling the trigger as fast as he could.
780 2018-03-26 19:33:58 Markets are such BS - no one wanted stocks last week and we were in correction. Got into puts as I lost a lot in calls - now today everything is ok again. Puts going to O - such crooks on Wall Street.

It doesn't come with a loaded mag, precision tech or bump stocks. You don't carry a metal pipe to shoot bullets growb out of your head. Wrong analogy. Ask the author
787 2018-03-26 19:30:14 To entertain one of your many falsehoods, if rapid fire causes jams, why do you want to ban hi cap mags and bump stocks? Seems to me that would cause a jam, therefore rendering the gun temporarily inoperable.

799 2018-03-26 19:27:24 If you can't use it to aim at a target, it is not an "arm." It is a toy.

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

Ban bump stocks.
800 2018-03-26 19:27:03 Oh, so if we make it mandatory to register and insure bump stocks and high-capacity magazines, you'd be okay with them?
801 2018-03-26 19:27:02 Clearly you don't understand the Constitution. The Constitution does not give the fed. government the authority to ban bump stocks. Stephen Paddock is the only mass shooter in history to have used the bump stock device. It's purely stupid to make owners of bump stocks criminals.

804 2018-03-26 19:26:16 As I’ve said and I only plan to say once more (because I’d rather not waste any more time), I believe it’s within our rights to own whatever type of gun we please. And I think that full auto rifles and semi autos with bump stocks should still be allowed.

838 2018-03-26 19:18:04 Perhaps one more sign this rally is likely to make a marginal new ATH--bonds bottomed a month ago and have barely started rising. In the past several years, stocks peak AFTER bonds start rising, not at the same time bonds bottom. Tells us it's late the game, but not Jan not peak.
839 2018-03-26 19:17:29 I'm not fine with any of those listed. Bump stocks was created for disabled people. To help them shoot. Bump stocks was used wrongly in just 1 case. Why ban them? Government shouldn't be allowed to ban personal property and a gun assessory

WARNING though, bought both products from the same department store and in both cases the SCREEN PROTECTORS were MISSING and no-one stocks IT... ESPECIALLY difficult because the ZEN has 2.5D screen.

907 2018-03-26 18:58:38 163 mass shootings under Obama yet no marches. Obama had control in the first term and made bump stocks legal! I think ppl need to re-evaluate who their villains are and why they are really marching. Is this about guns or about Trump?
908 2018-03-26 18:58:23 Traders unsure if weakness in EU stocks dragging the US off the highs or vice versa but European stocks are down on the day with the DAX now down 0.5%...
909 2018-03-26 18:57:49 The gun LOOKS military but is sold as a plain semi automatic rifle (NOT ASSAULT RIFLE). All the attachments such as scopes, barrels, rails, bump stocks (which isn't even legal in most if not all states. If you are a pro gunner reading this, correct me if I'm wrong) giv it a look
910 2018-03-26 18:57:36 All the love for US stocks is rather being lost on European stocks which are showing a rather awkward attempt to rally.. DAX up just 0.25% today.. Not a sign of strength at all considering the 2% rise in the US

916 2018-03-26 18:56:19 That's funny considering obama had full control for two years and didn't do a thing but now it's the NRA and Trumps fault. Oh wait Obama did do something he made it ok to buy bump stocks,
917 2018-03-26 18:55:44 It's called stock market volatility. If you want stability, put your money in a savings account. At your apparent age, I'd suggest stocks with long term yields.
918 2018-03-26 18:53:22 Especially surprising with stocks on the highs

925 2018-03-26 18:50:51 When the ATF approved bump stocks.  They did it because they DO NOT change the physical characteristics of the to make it an automatic weapon.

930 2018-03-26 18:50:14 Maybe these kids don’t have all the facts but their voices are just as important. I’m all for the 2nd amendment but I don’t see the necessity for owning a semi or fully automatic gun or bump stocks, high capacity ammo, etc...

935 2018-03-26 18:48:43 last years “common sense” gun control was magazine limits, bullet buttons, collapable stocks, and muzzle devices. Anything more than that was just “fear mongering.” Seems like you ppl moved the goal posts as predicted. Imagine my shock. Good luck with the gangs that won’t comply.
936 2018-03-26 18:48:41 That's not true. Obama legalized Bump Stocks.
937 2018-03-26 18:47:58 I don’t think the point is that all NRA members literally murder children (that in itself is an outrageous claim); but that by not budging in the much needed ban of bump-stocks & automatic weapons, U (proverbial U) R contributing 2 school mass shootings where these weapons R used

942 2018-03-26 18:46:39 Love the timing but this makes no sense: “Remington & other gunmakers have suffered from slumping sales in the past year as fears of stricter gun laws have faded.” Anyway, glad to hear it & glad I dumped my mutual funds that were invested in gun stocks!
943 2018-03-26 18:46:27 stocks go up and down. They don't have to go up or down because of something specific that did or didn't happen that day. that's ridiculous
944 2018-03-26 18:45:52 You need to do more, ban automatic weapons, bump stocks.  High capacity rounds is not enough.  I expect more as a voter.
945 2018-03-26 18:43:48 #2A doesn't cover bump stocks.
And Florida, well, it's states' rights. It's also infringing on rights mentioned in the constitution, so ... I guess we'll see.

949 2018-03-26 18:42:06 Obama did nothing for gun control after the Sandy Hook shooting in December 2012.  His ATF approved bumper stocks in 2010.  Contrast with Trump who got rid of bumper  stocks, put in tougher gun background checks, and money for CDC to study gun violence.  @JaclynCorin @KyleKashuv

961 2018-03-26 18:38:05 For a TLDR version: 
A ban on semi-automatic weapons that fire high-velocity rounds
A ban on bump stocks and other accessories that simulate automatic weapons
The creation of a database for gun sales and universal background checks
Raise the legal age to purchase guns to 21

968 2018-03-26 18:36:00 "Bump stocks" have already been defined to include a "conversion kit, a tool, an accessory, or a device" (FL SB 7026), not just the @SlideFireSol stock. This is purposefully ambiguous and we (also @NRA) should be fighting it for #2A infringement. @GunOwners need our help!

980 2018-03-26 18:31:52 Trump using the ATF to ban bump-stocks will allow a future Dem president to use the ATF to ban magazines. i.e. they could claim magazines turn a normal gun into a "machine gun".

995 2018-03-26 18:27:54 Yes, he wants:
Purchase age raised to 21, I agree.
Legislation on bump stocks, I agree. 
And an all out ban on assault rifles. Though I don't agree with this last one entirely because the term is so loosely defined I also haven't had an AR-15 pointed at me in the past 90 days.
996 2018-03-26 18:27:49 There are no gunnshow loopholes. The mass shooters aren't using bump stocks. Most shootings are done with handguns.
997 2018-03-26 18:27:35 #stocks  We're still looking at the FedHead, central bank directors, and their hedge fund  lackeys pouring lots of chum into the water today. We'll see if some sharks take the bait all the way through to 4:00 pm.
998 2018-03-26 18:27:19 worst stocks rout since Feb appears to be giving way to a more optimistic mood as limits of Trump administrn’s protectionism came into view

1000 2018-03-26 18:27:13 Trump banned bump stocks but not a word on getting owners to return them!y not get names and contact those who bought them. Otherwise it does not stop more massacres.

1003 2018-03-26 18:26:20 Also—bump stocks and "assault rifles".

Trump just had the DOJ enforce a bump stock ban.

There's no such thing as an "assault rifle". The assault weapons ban in the 90s basically said if it's painted black and has a pistol grip and a certain type of barrel, it's an assault rifle
1004 2018-03-26 18:26:13 Please go easy when investing in stocks. Stock market is a get rich quick that is stacked against the average person. After years of saving, lost total retirement in 3wks due to company making bad choices. They got bailed out. The customers didn't !!! Be wise, learn more. Gd luck
1005 2018-03-26 18:25:42 What a great start to this week. Class ended early n profit on stocks 
1006 2018-03-26 18:24:08 I don't think you can use language in this analogy.  When we think of stocks and cryptos, we have different industries that engage in each. The term "stock" or "crypto" is simply a way to cluster the concept of investment across a plethora of different baskets under an umbrella
1007 2018-03-26 18:24:08 One instance of 59, one. Horrible. We still have NO answers of why that happened. Bump stocks were used yet I know of nobody that uses them, never even heard of them prior to that. Prior to that, single largest mast shooting was VT. Handguns.
1008 2018-03-26 18:23:24 The Dow going up 500+ points doesn't seem as irrational as it dropping 500+
Almost like it only makes sense for stocks to go up.
1009 2018-03-26 18:23:23 Restrictions on bump stocks 
Age limits 
Mental Health Assessments 
Background checks 
Proof of safe storage 
Guns per person limit 
Introduce gun license

Ban any and all guns

1011 2018-03-26 18:23:04 And don’t even talk to me about automatic weapons being banned when it takes 17 dead kids on top of the Las Vegas shootings to get bump stocks banned. Just admit you would rather have your kids shot in schools than surrender your assault weapons.
1012 2018-03-26 18:22:52 A 1962 provision in the tax code enables companies to repatriate cash without paying any taxes as long as it is used to purchase Treasuries or other US securities such as stocks and corporate bonds. US firms with headquarters in IRL would also be “Irish” if they own Treasuries
1013 2018-03-26 18:22:43 Ban on bump stocks, yes, although it’s meaningless. Age limit  of 21, no, there are too many 18-21 yr olds buried in military cemeteries for rights that you would deprive them. Universal background checks are wide open for bureaucrats and politicians to abuse, and they will.

1019 2018-03-26 18:21:16 What you're stating is not one stock, it's multiple stocks. Each operates in a different sector. Yes investors want one to rule each sector. It's the same with cryptocurrencies. Not every crypto is a "currency" like Bitcoin (i.e. Ethereum as a platform) and many others.

1023 2018-03-26 18:20:30 If you give them a inch they will take a mile. No compromise on Bump Stocks. They say it them selfs in one of there interviews. First Bump stocks then the Rest. An yes Bump stock ban will be ineffective .

1027 2018-03-26 18:19:04 Nor is the Alt Right the majority.  Most of us are in the center of and 91% want gun law reforms. The right for our children an grandchildren to live trumps the right to own military style weapons, high capacity magazines, bump stocks, etc.
1028 2018-03-26 18:18:51 1. Why bump stocks? You only have LV to point to. If you believe the "official story," fine, they were used. If you believe the acoustic forensic evidence, there's no way.

2. Loopholes are a myth. Full background checks are still required.

3. Military style = made up term.

1038 2018-03-26 18:14:56 @jesseEODM Those young people are the changes in our gov't policies.Gun owners want to keep the guns. I've spoken to several owners who say Loesch does not represent them. They see compromise as solution & are willing to give up assault rifles & bump stocks.A reasonable solution.
1039 2018-03-26 18:14:42 $AAPL, $AMZN, $ROBO all rocketing and continuing to lead #SPX higher. These tech stocks have zero gravity, amazing to watch.
1040 2018-03-26 18:14:35 I know bump stocks weren't involved in the Parkland shooting, but did anybody at the #MarchForOurLives publicly thank the White House / DOJ for Friday's proposed rule change?
1041 2018-03-26 18:14:06 Your right it not crumbs for corporations and wealthy. Research is already proving that corporations aren't giving raises or hiring instead they are buying back stocks
1042 2018-03-26 18:13:54 BIOC also has shown resistance multiple times around .36 recently, so be cautious yet. But I'm watching it for possible re-entry. Traded it perfectly in last Feb-March move
1043 2018-03-26 18:13:49 After pull back. Stocks will probably not bottoming february lows. Still volatility but digesting that to maximize NRJ. Still confident.

1045 2018-03-26 18:12:33 TSLA -General Question -as stated in Key list video, for most stocks it is not good to chase gapup, it is a setup, but is good for drop and Pullback, so why is the straight gapup a setup? And is it good to play pull back for these stocks if up the previous day? TSLA, GOOGL
1046 2018-03-26 18:12:11 They could but that could be a financially bad move as I'm sure their stocks would plummet even more.
1047 2018-03-26 18:11:57 My takeaway from Saturday's #MarchForOurLives → divest from gun stocks. Your 401k may inadvertently investing in major gun stocks (AOBC, RGR, VSTO, OLN).  Use your money to make socially responsible choices. #goodbyegunstocks #divest #EnoughIsEnough

1051 2018-03-26 18:10:47 ?BIOC... if .30 holds, then yes. But I'd be cautious yet w earnings 3/28. Earnings tend to be negative catalysts on stocks like this. I'd use .29-.30 for stop-loss if being long now
1052 2018-03-26 18:10:45 Which shooters used bump stocks or 100 rd mags?

1055 2018-03-26 18:10:06 The narrative isn’t about enforcing the laws on the books. If you hear their own words it’s to add more laws and when trump did add a law recently they were upset there was no word “gun” in the law. Yet it got rid of bump stocks and other mods that change legal guns to illegal

1080 2018-03-26 18:01:57 US stocks started the week higher, as investor anxiety over restrictive trade policies around the world began to subside. The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that China and the US have quietly started negotiating to improve US access to Chinese markets..
1081 2018-03-26 18:01:29 I doubt it, but at the same time it would not surprise me. Chip stocks and payment platforms have moved with its price before. It could have some ripples.
1082 2018-03-26 18:01:25 Boycotting their companies as companies that are complicit in killing our children every day. Pressuring sponsors to leave them. Boycotting mutual funds that carry their bloody stocks. Once mutual funds kick them out, NRA will slowly but surely become irrelevant.

1094 2018-03-26 17:56:01 I'm not fan of bump stocks or full auto (they are not the same). I found thatthe M16 in full auto burns thru ammo to fast and heats up real quick. Only good for fire suppression and once you go full auto you have exposed your position. Semi auto is better to me. Less waste.

1145 2018-03-26 17:36:02 Jesus says we have retribution coming for us to but not much back on that money for us. God says another scam took hold on us when we weren't even thinking about it. Its called stocks & bonds that a company took advantage of & we lost it all. God says we will get it back soon.
1146 2018-03-26 17:35:52 A client’s goal should be to achieve financial independence and maintain it throughout retirement. Active management has nothing to do with this. Investing in “stocks” is sold to the public using market returns, aka Ibbotson charts. It’s not sold via active returns over mkts.

1148 2018-03-26 17:34:20 BEWARE. TDAm has poor security. My accts spoofed by imposter over 3 weeks.  40k stocks sold. Suspicious activities and voice recognition was not detected. They banned me from their platform when I outed them on social media.
1149 2018-03-26 17:34:11 $FB even collects data on who you call from your cell phone and who calls you. How is that comfortable with you? #Stocks
1150 2018-03-26 17:34:02 Some Midcap stocks for a change please.
1151 2018-03-26 17:34:01 La majorité des stocks d'arme qui se sont retrouvés à vendre n'étaient pas russe mais provenait des pays satellites (Ukraine,...).
En aucun cas elle n'a concerné les armes stratégiques ou secrètes mais seulement l'armement léger produit en grande quantité par l'Union Soviétique.
1152 2018-03-26 17:33:51 They love saying how great of shots they can make, yet still want 30 Rnd BCs or 75 -120 rnd drums? If they're such great shots why all the extra ammo? Or bump stocks that change the mechanics of a gun?

This is placing power of authority on a weapon.. because they're weak.
1153 2018-03-26 17:33:50 Automatic weapons "assault weapons" are tightly regulated already. Bump stocks should be banned. Funny. You want to use kids to push agenda. Then say they are to immature to own a firearm. Already have background checks. Fact checks and polls are biased.

1156 2018-03-26 17:32:37 I agree! The LEFT works in schools and hospitals. We also weld. We unclog pipes. We install tile and repair engines. We trade stocks and lay brick. And yes, sometimes we take a day (or afternoon) off to protest. The they-don’t-have-jobs joke is tired and cliche. So go protest!
1157 2018-03-26 17:32:28 Everyone is buying $FB shares.. You can literally steal personal information from these bums and they'll still buy the stock. Let me laugh. Zuckerberg is pathetic as a man. I'll pass on that shit show. #Stocks
1158 2018-03-26 17:32:27 Bump stocks will almost certainly make crazy shooter miss who he aims at..

#LasVegasShooting  was so bad because crowd didn't run away 
1159 2018-03-26 17:32:13 Bump stocks came about from people using their beltloops for the same purpose.  Should we ban belts next?
1160 2018-03-26 17:31:58 If Trump uses the ATF to ban Bump-stocks, then a future Dem President will use the ATF to ban magazines.
1161 2018-03-26 17:31:25 First, not at all what I'm saying. Second, a majority of those CEOs haven't done anything to earn that other than sit at a desk and watch stocks. They haven't contributed.
1162 2018-03-26 17:31:05 anyone gonna mention how the russian federation was declared free of chemical weapons stocks by an international body of representatives from 192 countries just last year?
1163 2018-03-26 17:30:55 Where's the age specification? Right, there is none. Raise it to 21

1166 2018-03-26 17:29:31 No.  What you do depends on how old you are and more that makes you who you are.  But in the long term stocks are more predictable than the short term regardless of who you are.   Stocks are what stocks are regardless of you, me or my pet anteater.

1168 2018-03-26 17:28:37 With stocks and bonds, market moves based on shift in fundamentals first. The frantic trades of crowds jumping in and out of a stock is a second order factor at best, in the long run. With cryptocurrencies, it's all there is - giving insiders the absolute power over the market.
1169 2018-03-26 17:28:33 Yes. Months. Since Donny had been in office. All weapon mfg stocks have tanked in a year...

1171 2018-03-26 17:27:34 And it's mostly full of excellent stuff like banning bump stocks, putting together a real database of gun sales, universal background checks. 

But I do not blame my friends struggling with mental illness for being deeply alarmed by the proposal to change privacy laws.
1172 2018-03-26 17:27:21 From Jim Paulsen @LeutholdGroup: Watch the yield curve! There's less of a spread betw. short- and long-term rates, but chance of recession next yr still just 4%.

1184 2018-03-26 17:20:02 He practically personally forced people to get bump stocks. Despite the numerous cries from the GOP “Please President Obama, please don’t make bump stocks legal! We want gun legislation now!” GMAFB
1185 2018-03-26 17:19:59 1. bump stocks are stupid and serve no purpose.  should not exist.  i nor any of my friends own one.  in fact ive never seen one.  if i was out shooting steal and someone walked up with 1 id say who invited this clown? agree or disagree we should get rid of them?
1186 2018-03-26 17:19:58 You understand we have background checks, correct?  Bump stocks have been banned.  No need to increase age to 21 as you are infringing upon the rights of 18 - 20 year olds.  What if we focus on enforcement of existing laws before adding more?
1187 2018-03-26 17:19:53 The Justice Department is the one that's already taken action on the bump stocks, actually, and is implementing new guidelines. Trump hasn't even talked much about it because the DoJ is handing it. So that one has a decent chance of happening.

1197 2018-03-26 17:17:54 we are against anything that turn a gun into a simulated auto (such as bump stocks) and against high cap mags. You don’t need those. No one does. Unless you’re in active combat in the military or law enforcement...you don’t need these things. Period.
1198 2018-03-26 17:17:35 I see both sides. You put more resources into the higher yield investment. Especially when said investment is more stable. However, where Affiliates make twitch a higher % per sub and there are more of them (think penny stocks) I think they’re missing out on potential profit.

1214 2018-03-26 17:12:15 Investors buy and sell stocks before the media can report news. If stocks are rising, then trade negotiations are most likely smoothing out.
1215 2018-03-26 17:12:01 I agree. It’s just an interesting tactic after a big drop in the market for $40. Definitely don’t understand the FB choice but he likely did it in other top stocks too

1232 2018-03-26 17:05:25 I'd ban high-capacity magazines and devices that significantly increase achievable rate of fire (such as bump stocks). I'd expand background checks.

That's the short of it, really.

1250 2018-03-26 16:59:50 Bump stocks are a novelty item   People who know there rifle can simulate / do the same just by shouldering & pulling forward on the stock ... also much more accurate this way.  Magazines can be made in a 3D printer. Banning anything just makes a underground / black market
1251 2018-03-26 16:58:40 You do realize that stocks are highly risky forms of investment and will fluctuate based upon the smallest market factors, right?
1252 2018-03-26 16:58:36 Here in the great 2A violation state of MA, “they” banned bump stocks. Last I heard just 3 were turned in so yea great big nothing burger but they all celebrated... smh

1255 2018-03-26 16:57:56 There were probably 100 or more school related shootings during Obamas terms. Not of the magnitude as far as deaths, but Obama gave the okay for bump stocks, and so it goes. Pres Trump wants to ban them, and focus regulations, mental health etc.

1259 2018-03-26 16:55:58 Admittedly, I'm defining Never Trumper as someone never willing to give Trump any credit. I like the banning of bump stocks. I'll give credit! But I can't think of anything else. And I would never vote for him. But in theory he could have a policy I liked and I'd say I liked it.
1260 2018-03-26 16:54:17 Can we just pretend that banning bump stocks is a big deal so these dickheads will feel like they’ve won and go away?

1266 2018-03-26 16:52:23 This guys an idiot.

The President was correct in leaving.

1271 2018-03-26 16:51:16 Selling puts would be the best option, just is too risky if doesn't stop to fall.
But it's true that fang stocks doesn't need to many days to consolidate.
Wait at least an up day to enter, you will lose a few gains but could save you a lot of money.
1272 2018-03-26 16:50:30 Don't get me wrong I've made a fair amount of money from BTC and ICO investments since January - but the market is extremely volatile. I've reinvested into some stocks so it's reassuring to see steady, gradual growth for a change 
1273 2018-03-26 16:49:40 Check again. It was already determined in court that an EO can't make bump stocks illegal that's why Obama's was challenged & overturned. The courts have said only legislation making it a law can make it illegal. Congress will have to draft and bill for idiot to sign to ban them.

I am good with banning bump stocks
1281 2018-03-26 16:47:32 They published a "manifesto" that includes banning assault style weapons and bump stocks, and does not include overturning the 2nd Amendment. They have said  from day 1 that they're not against the 2nd Amendment. Also, you didn't answer: why do you need an assault style weapon?

1284 2018-03-26 16:46:51 But first;
1)List attacks where bump stocks played a roll (and NO, it didn't in LV)
2)Detail "Universal" and differentiate it from the current background check. Further, list cases where the existing background check was employed - but failed.
3)List attacks which used 100 rd mag
1285 2018-03-26 16:46:46 Who actually thinks my support of #2A and the NRA means I don't care about kids dying? And can someone please tell me what "common sense gun regulation" means when Leftists say it? Seems to range from banning bump stocks to banning all guns.
1286 2018-03-26 16:46:42 Bump stocks are stupid, but since they were only categorized this way on the second attempt, amid political pressure, and using legal chicanery, it's pretty obvious the proper process (involving Congress) has been circumvented. Support rule of law, not rule of bureaucracy!

1300 2018-03-26 16:42:52 That's fair. I want:

-National gun register for non hunting rifles
-Auto/Semi auto ban(willing to allow ex-military own semi autos but must be registered)
-Comprehensive federal background checks system revamp 
-21 is the age to buy a gun
-Ban bump stocks
-Ban clip sizes over 10

1303 2018-03-26 16:41:46 Amen brutha.  Completely agreed on that point.  We just found the too deadly point where lawmakers actually banned bump stocks.   Mental health and school security will help, but it depends what we as a society do with that.
1304 2018-03-26 16:41:31 It's amazing that stocks are being traded on headlines when that's rule number 1. Don't sell on headlines...
1305 2018-03-26 16:41:25 Suspect that might have unintended consequences for some BUT could make it such that regulated tax wrappers can't hold unregulated investments?

Or

1311 2018-03-26 16:40:48 Bump stocks simply do not violate any existing law the only facilitate bump firing. They are still 1 trigger pull 1 bullet. Banning bump stocks won't really do anything since they still can be printed by criminals or they can use something else to bump fire their weapons.

1313 2018-03-26 16:40:05 IMO, buy a stock just on the criteria of low P/E is a big trap making investors lose money. There must be a reason why a stock is traded soo cheap. Bad management, less promoter holding, no scope of growth in business. But we discount everything else and buy stocks just on PE.
1314 2018-03-26 16:39:59 Do you think the two markets are correlated dude? Stats say its weak but the rise of crypto has obviously coincided with the current bull run. Some argue it would be a hedge in a bear market for stocks (specifically $btc) but I doubt it personally.

1320 2018-03-26 16:38:35 Hi, ~85% of American’s who can’t afford to invest in stocks. What you all really should be doing is investing in that other thing that’s super cost prohibitive, real estate.
1321 2018-03-26 16:38:12 So we ban assault rifles (Please have someone clearly define an assault rifle or weapon), We ban bump stocks, we ban automatic weapons but we do not ban guns nor do we remove guns from people. Strict background checks *This costs tax payer dollars* sound great and I applaud it.

1324 2018-03-26 16:38:03 I think the CHURCH itself should not be taxed because the CHURCH is the CONGREGATION. Income generating institutions which are managed by the CHURCH MINISTERS (e.g. Schools, company stocks, agri lands, paid services, etc.) are the ones that should be taxed.
1325 2018-03-26 16:37:57 I’m going to veto banning semi-auto personally. Our current restrictions on full-auto/ machine guns seem reasonable but perhaps need tweaking. I’m not sure on bump stocks. But it seems we both want advancement in the same general direction.

1332 2018-03-26 16:35:19 These bump stocks with pistol grip swing out cup holders and high capacity footprint gas pedals are out here stealing babies! Common sense says it needs to be stopped! I’m going to wear a pussy hat about it to raise awareness. Do your part plz

1334 2018-03-26 16:33:58 YUGE mistake to invest in Chinese oil stocks as it is STILL a communist regime and can and likely will intervene in the operations and free market practices of such trading...they have shown this hand before
1335 2018-03-26 16:33:43 Legalized bump stocks? That's one of your biggest whoppers. I'd love to see you get through a day without lying, although I don't know what I'd do without the entertainment

1337 2018-03-26 16:32:20 Rubio is not better than this. We are calling for a ban on assault weapons, we had one between 1994 and 2004. We want to also ban high-capacity magazines and bump stocks. We also want universal background checks.

1340 2018-03-26 16:32:03 The record for mass murder by an individual still goes to the guy with a truck in Nice, France. 86 dead and 434 injurrd in under 10 minutes. The Las Vegas guy, with multiple firearms and bump stocks and prime sniping position couldn't even beat that.
1341 2018-03-26 16:31:47 Fun fact. We got Disney stocks haha 
1342 2018-03-26 16:31:40 1. This essentially forms a gun registry (at least, a registry of gun owners)
2. Someone who owns a gun illegally won’t join
3. NRA can be bought/pressured the culture just like anyone else (they caved on bump stocks
4. Why punish law abiding people for crimes they didn’t commit?
1343 2018-03-26 16:30:17 No one is pushing gun control measures that will punish law abiding gun owners. “Law abiding” doesn’t describe the shooter at Parkland. If there were a law outlawing bump stocks, as congress prevented Obama from passing, the Las Vegas shooter might not have had them.
1344 2018-03-26 16:30:06 I care about the rule of law.

Are bump stocks "the current problem?" Accessories? 

If I am the problem, tell me whom I influenced to shoot anybody.

I don't even believe in public schooling, but if you do, if you believe in gathering kids together where they can be shot...

1346 2018-03-26 16:29:41 That's like saying Obama "approved" bump stocks. It shows a misunderstanding of how the government works. Good government doesn't do anything without supportive legislative requirements - that's democracy. Your argument is deliberately misleading. Honor, courage, commitment?
1347 2018-03-26 16:29:27 There are an untold number of Bump Stocks in private hands. Shutting the gate now will not retrieve that horse.
1348 2018-03-26 16:29:08 All Americans presidents start with Anti war rhetoric and end up with wars and regime changes expanding their markets.

1371 2018-03-26 16:21:10 Yes. I know you said it was your largest holding. It IS a lesson that you shouldn't put all your eggs in one basket, even if that basket is soaring. But that's true of ALL of the FANG stocks. How many people own ALL of them? They all move up and down together. Not very diverse.
1372 2018-03-26 16:20:39 What do stocks do in a trade war? Hard to say, countries that engage in them today don't really have stock markets (Venezuela, Iran, Zimbabwe, etc) and the last one among major countries was 90 years ago. But its safe to say it wouldn't be good.

1376 2018-03-26 16:19:25 I support banning bump stocks too, and i agree on the machine guns being banned too but im just saying its kinda risky when organizations use laws and directives to keep the sale open, or leave little hints that they might want to open/ unban those kinds of weapons

1388 2018-03-26 16:14:35 You obviously haven't checked your stocks lately. The market fell 1200 points last week keep up
1389 2018-03-26 16:14:30 This is why I don't think banning bump stocks is unconstitutional, they don't make a gun more effective at carrying out what the 2nd amendment intends.
1390 2018-03-26 16:14:27 Do you guys use stocks to trade to find this news so quickly? Or was it Friday

1393 2018-03-26 16:13:23 We better ban 3D printers also. They can make guns and bump stocks and high capacity magazines. Also ban criminals from having them that’ll stop all shootings!!!! Yeah fucking right #DefendTheSecond #gunsense #DavidHogg
1394 2018-03-26 16:13:16 @Call_Me_Dutch Thank you for being outspoken on gun violence and calling for banning bump stocks, high capacity magazines, and assault weapons!  We stand with you on your efforts!  #EnoughIsEnough
1395 2018-03-26 16:13:16 THIS JUST IN: KY senate decides instead of investing in stocks for struggling pension system, will instead invest in sure deal various offers from out of country Princes that want to share their fortunes with individuals for just a “small” up front investment.....
1396 2018-03-26 16:13:07 1) I was at a march Saturday. Bump stocks are NOT illegal. Obama tried but GOP shut it down. High magazine rounds are still available in many places. Who the hell needs a 50 round clip yet one can be bought at a store a few miles from where I was.
1397 2018-03-26 16:13:04 You didn’t hear if you give us bump stocks we’re gonna take it all (paraphrased)?
1398 2018-03-26 16:12:18 He did absolutely nothing to help with gun violence. Except increase the amount of felons allowed to buy a gun. He legalized bump stocks. Why would someone who claims to care, do that? Really you worked for each President? How many presidents would that be?
1399 2018-03-26 16:12:09 March 26 (Reuters) - Canada's main stock index climbed on Monday from five-week lows, led by gains in financial stocks, as reports of talks between the United States and China eased trade war worries
1400 2018-03-26 16:12:04 Yep, same can be said for Coke, Chocolate Cake, and bump stocks

1406 2018-03-26 16:10:47 Dow up 1.5% today. Stocks are not the issue, they are a symptom of a wider malaise. 
Gold and Silver rises are not linked to equity sell-off either.
1407 2018-03-26 16:10:18 Dude, don't you think you're putting the cart before the horse? What if Trump pulls off a trade deal with China? You'll be the reason people lose money. Explain all possible outcomes to your audience. That way, your audience isn't baffled if stocks end up going up.

1412 2018-03-26 16:09:04 I’m loving my APL stocks
1413 2018-03-26 16:08:45 Wow the trade wars between us and china really put everything on volatile. Ticking bombs. Buying stocks showed a loss of 20% for 20 seconds and stabilizes 1% at some point. Wow. This is called holding ur ground. If you have thousands of stocks bought it is scary.
1414 2018-03-26 16:08:26 It won't stop at bump stocks. Used in one terrible incident and it's branded a common use device for mass murderers.
1415 2018-03-26 16:07:52 Hey Kurt, are you aware of 3d Printers? Because at some point, people will print out their own bump stocks. People will find a way.
1416 2018-03-26 16:07:09 Right I definitely agree there are people there who are protesting the outright ban of guns, but the movement itself has different intentions. Is there some middle ground that could be found? Such as ban of bump stocks and large magazines
1417 2018-03-26 16:06:45 You really haven’t thought this through. Kind of like when you sold all your stocks for your children’s education in 2016.

1419 2018-03-26 16:06:35 (a) universal background checks are a de facto registry (b) only like 3 people have bump stocks (3) no magazine can “fire a bullet”.
1420 2018-03-26 16:06:24 Why do you think the government should have the right to ban bump stocks?
1421 2018-03-26 16:06:14 Je vois que vous êtes en organisation de plein-vide, très bien pour les stocks dans les différents services,mais aussi pour les infirmières qui ne s'occupent plus de la gestion des stocks. Félicitation à vous tous .

1424 2018-03-26 16:05:16 These calls to ban high cap mags and bump stocks are just stupid. Won’t change anything. It just comes across as “well we can’t ban the actual firearm, so lets ban every possible accessory.” SMH.

1430 2018-03-26 16:04:03 But you're still holding... I also have a theory. Could whale's be playing both markets and transferring funds from stocks to Crypto and back?
1431 2018-03-26 16:03:51 We assumed a rate of return of around 8 percent. A diversified portfolio with 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds returned that % annually on average over the last 20 years
1432 2018-03-26 16:03:31 The left often bemoans lack of willingness to compromise.  What are you offering as a compromise in exchange for Bump-Stocks?  Nationwide reciprocity?  For 100 round magazines? Take suppressors off the NFA list?  You are willing to compromise, aren't you?
1433 2018-03-26 16:03:15 I just love how these fools think every gun owner has 100 round magazine's & bump stocks at their disposal. I agree with comprehensive background checks & a database where all registered guns & owners can be found easily.
1434 2018-03-26 16:02:41 The funny thing is, the only reason gun ownrs r against the ban on bump stocks is because, if you give an inch they'll take a mile. Bump stocks r a novelty and can be made with $10 of stuff from Home Depot. You don't even need one anyway. This is y non gun ownrs should be quiet.
1435 2018-03-26 16:02:29 Nine years after the S&P 500 hit its low, the index was up around 390% - and was roughly 122% higher than its record close before the Great Recession began.  So, while the collapse was painful, stocks weathered the storm, sailing far beyond where they were before the collapse.
1436 2018-03-26 16:02:15 Someone watches Fox a little too much. Otherwise he missed hearing them saying they don't want to take away all guns. They want AR15 type weapons, bump stocks, and high round magazine removed. Also nation-wide backgrounds checks and waiting periods. All reasonable gun issues.

1439 2018-03-26 16:02:00 Ok but none of that prevents a criminal from shooting Up a school or church. how do your restrictions do anything again. An unopposed shooter could reload and bump stocks are banned now but other than one shooting they were used in how does that prevent a shooting.
1440 2018-03-26 16:01:26 Less than a year later, the markets hit bottom on March 9, 2009. In the years since, stocks have corrected multiple times, losing over 10%. But they still haven't lost 20% to push into a "bear market" yet meaning we're in the midst of the 2nd longest bull run since World War II
1441 2018-03-26 16:01:24 Facebook has done everything it can to silence conservatives. This couldnt happen to a nicer company. Facebook stocks crushed as it is announced that the Federal Trade Commission has launched an investigation into the company.
1442 2018-03-26 16:01:22 Several hunting rifles beat a 5.56 in MV. Most guns are capable of optics mounting. Bump stocks are worthless and society has no need for them. Many rifles including single shots and bolt action have a flash suppressor. What is so bad about a collapsible stock or pistol grip?
1443 2018-03-26 16:01:13 Criminals have always had guns. The problem today is that mentally ill and underage kids are getting their hands on them. There is no need for AR 15 /bump stocks or any other weapon designed for "mass" loss of life to be in civilian  hands.  #VetsForGunReform
1444 2018-03-26 16:00:59 @benshapiro you realize that banning bump stocks will prevent many handicapped people with limited mobility from using their firearms.  Bumpstocks were originally designed for the handicapped to use their firearms.

1448 2018-03-26 15:59:25 Stocks sold off in dramatic fashion to close out the week.  If fact, it was the worst weekly performance for equities in over two years as political risk superseded concerns over higher interest rates.
1449 2018-03-26 15:59:16 Most people want common sense regulations: waiting periods, background checks, banning civilian ownership of military type weapons and bump stocks, training/testing of proper usage/safety and storage. How is ANY of that infringing on your 2A rights?
1450 2018-03-26 15:59:13 Good google look up Rob, can u do me a favor n show it to the dumbass ppl in government who go on talk shows n have no idea what their talking about. From Bum stocks to cartridges kill ppl, it’s getting ridiculous.

1464 2018-03-26 15:55:46 but i think most of it is just a mindset thing where now when i get three stocks up i'm not thinking "hell yeah" but rather "PLZ DON'T GET REVERSE FOUR STOCKED" (in all caps)
1465 2018-03-26 15:55:37 I'm fine with banning bump stocks. But until you ban belts you're not solving the problem you think you're solving.
1466 2018-03-26 15:55:35 Are you a criminal?
Do you buy guns for criminals?
Do you sell guns to criminals?
No? Good. Your rights shall not be infringed.

But, you do not have the right to own weapons of mass destruction. Bump stocks, high capacity mags, assault rifles, are WMDs.
1467 2018-03-26 15:54:35 I hate stocks.
1468 2018-03-26 15:54:23 its happened twice at my weekly and ya we had that insane game 5 at KS2.

i think a lot of it comes down to that i get three stocks up winning neutral in unorthodox ways, that when my opponent starts getting their footing it's hard to reel back and adapt under the pressure
1469 2018-03-26 15:54:14 I need to learn how to buy stocks because I'm extremely good at predicting trends.

1471 2018-03-26 15:53:55 basket of stocks and sit on those. Others (target-date) are a lot like index funds, but rebalance as investors get older so the fund is less risky at retirement age. The big difference is, actively-traded funds charge large fees (up to 2-ish%) for their services. Index funds 2/
1472 2018-03-26 15:52:39 Up until the Last Vegas shooting Bump Stocks were not on anyone's Radar. Hell I had to look them up to find out how they worked.

1474 2018-03-26 15:51:50 Mutual funds are an easy way to diversify your investments. Rather than investing in 100s of stocks, you can buy 1 stock that represents the value of a large basket of stocks. Some funds buy and sell frequently, trying to get a good return. Others (index funds) just buy a 1/

1476 2018-03-26 15:50:23 Obama did no make bump stocks legal. He just didn't interfere when the ATF concluded that the law gave him no right to regulate them. I agree this is not acceptable and more should have been done.
1477 2018-03-26 15:50:12 I know I’m tweeting to the choir but please encourage others to not ban bump stocks as it won’t change a thing to make anyone safer. Enough of these goofy infringements.@RepThomasMassie: No new gun control! #2A!

1481 2018-03-26 15:49:33 It's not an crazy request to keep military-grade weapons out of the hands of civilians. There is no need for bump stocks to be sold to anyone. It's not unreasonable to want my future children, my nephew, any children I'll be lucky to have in my life to feel safe at school.

1489 2018-03-26 15:45:29 FYI. Obama administration didn't legalize bump stocks, they couldn't be banned under the laws that were passed as they don't alter the physical mechanism of a gun rather using the physics of it to enhance its performance. Saying it was legalized is an innacurate simplification.
1490 2018-03-26 15:44:18 Let's not go back to the 1920's & all have Tommy Guns! Rifles (without bump stocks) , shotguns & handguns are ALL that is MORE than necessary.  Our government IS under attack: call it the Dems, call it N. Korea,  call it Russia.  The ONLY hope is to vote for republicans !!

1506 2018-03-26 15:37:14 Worst president, you did nothing to ban weapons, you allowed bump stocks, just go away and stay out of politics.
1507 2018-03-26 15:37:12 First the progressive socialist Dems wanted your automatic weapons. Then they realized that they were already outlawed. Then they wanted bump stocks that convert semi automatic weapons into automatic weapons. Now they want the semi automatic weapons. What do you think is next?
1508 2018-03-26 15:37:11 Yes his DOJ apvd sale of bump stocks.

Overweight stocks versus #bonds, and buying financials, industrials and oil. Another prediction: Stocks will fall further only if bond yields also go down. #FixedIncome
1513 2018-03-26 15:34:56 Universal background checks
Ban bump stocks
Ban 100-round drums and high capacity magazines which are ONLY designed to fire as many bullets as possible.

That wasn't hard, was it @benshapiro?
1514 2018-03-26 15:33:30 Are you a member of the NRA? If so, you're not an ally of  #MarchForOurLives. Those kids know the NRA has a stranglehold on our nations gun legislation. 

Do you think you have a constitutional right to own semiautomatics, bump stocks, and high capacity mags?

1529 2018-03-26 15:27:22 A ban on assault weapons and bump stocks, limits on magazines size. Federal background checks with teeth, no exceptions for private sales. Red flag laws in all 50 states. Mandatory training, licensing, registry, insurance for gun owners, etc, etc, etc.

1612 2018-03-26 15:01:22 And a couple of things here... you don’t need an amendment for basic regulations like banning certain types of weapons, bump stocks, or high capacity magazines, or expanding universal checks and closing loopholes. Fully automatic weapons, RPGs, and modified shotguns are...
1613 2018-03-26 15:00:40 As with poker. It feels like trading is a combination of many different things, ultimately leading to a decision that is supported by multiple factors. Experience seems to a main factor in all of this.... I feel with stocks its a bit easier to miss something.

1642 2018-03-26 14:54:35 Why we show solidarity with Britain over Russians killing a Russian spy is hard enough to understand; why Polish stocks show solidarity with #Facebook is totally beyond me

1644 2018-03-26 14:54:24 Exactly.  People still think the NRA defend bump stocks, when it was the NRA who wrote the ATF asking if they were/should be legal, i.e. the NRA suggested they shouldn't be.  We need to stop debating half-truths and drill down on real holes in our system.
1645 2018-03-26 14:54:24 Great job by @60Minutes stocks are up 400 points on the news it was a one night stand, people REALIZED @POTUS is not insane. Got to learn from #BillClinton the sex scandals made him more popular the more the GOP pushed the story, case in point he is up on the polls down negative

1649 2018-03-26 14:53:12 Correct, I see no justification for civilian use of MGs. Am allowing others (you) to offer a view not considered - that can potentially convince me (srsly). At this point, I would vote to ban the AR15, bump stocks & any MGs. But ok w/bolt, lever and pump action rifles & pistols.
1650 2018-03-26 14:53:01 Best stock tip I can give you is stocks go up and stocks go down. Can’t miss. My inspiration for this is Homer Simpson (bed goes up bed goes down bed goes up...).
1651 2018-03-26 14:52:04 Ergo... my argument still valid. Some people can give blood while others can't. There are various rules and checks necessary to ensure the safety of the blood stocks. Be grateful that others can donate in case you might need a transfusion one day.
1652 2018-03-26 14:52:02 first time I see it bid like this with stocks up. Sign of strentgh for sure. So hard to trade.
1653 2018-03-26 14:52:00 Watch them NRA stocks moe.

1655 2018-03-26 14:51:37 We want the best for our community. We're happy you haven't been effected but it looks like stocks has some gigantic faults we do not our community to get effected by.
1656 2018-03-26 14:51:28 Depends on when they bought the stocks.
1657 2018-03-26 14:50:17 Just had a comments section "conversation" with a dude, until he finally told me, "I’m an @NRA member but absolutely believe we need stricter background checks, no bump fire stocks, and no criminal or mental patient should own guns."

Dude, who are you arguing with, then?
1658 2018-03-26 14:50:09 Media should refrain from showing this news. Hoarders will hold stocks ,and this will rise the price unnecessarily.
1659 2018-03-26 14:49:38 Selling in $FB becoming climatic to the downside as traders and probably multiyear holders dump the stock. This is now forced selling as managers can't hold on to this stocks without getting fired I suppose.

1666 2018-03-26 14:46:58 Stocks roar higher as Trumps trade war seems more like a bad bluff than a war. China and US will work this out. Stock were too cheap and now some bargains have showed up for a change. Like Disney. #BlackPanther breaking more records. $dis

1671 2018-03-26 14:44:25 I don’t either but I own AR’s along with bump stocks just to have in my gun collection. So shut the Fck up.
1672 2018-03-26 14:44:14 Bump stocks being banned is good but what about auto triggers? I doubt they're covered by a bump stock ban. Both need to be gone!
1673 2018-03-26 14:44:13 What do you make of comments like this?  “When you give us an inch, that bump stocks ban, we will take a mile,” said student Delaney Tarr. “We are not here for breadcrumbs, we are here to lead.”  I mean, to me that seems pretty transparent, right?  No hiding of intentions.

1675 2018-03-26 14:43:51 All the tech stocks are up considerably this morning. $FB is down nearly 5%. Has something happened to Facebook?
1676 2018-03-26 14:43:28 I could care less about bump stocks; I’m pretty sure Trump knows they’re insignificant, but it needs to stop with bump stocks. If Trump offers up anything else then we will have a problem.
1677 2018-03-26 14:43:16 Hopes for deregulation under the Trump administration have helped bank stocks outperform the broader market. The KBW index soared roughly 30% in the year following the November 2016 presidential election, outpacing the SP500’s 22% gain.
1678 2018-03-26 14:42:56 Everything is going into the toilet,  along with your BS! STOCKS crashing,  unemployment up,  due to store closures,  tariffs are causing international consequences,  govt debt increasing,  deficit......
1679 2018-03-26 14:42:37 CPR classes.
Ok.
Hey @RickSantorum 
Good idea for you to try.
Visit your local shooting range.
Bring your CPR practice dummy.
Make sure AR15’s are used w/bump stocks. 
On your mark, get set, go!
Dodge all the bullets, carry your friend, now drop and do CPR.
Some advice.
Shut up.
1680 2018-03-26 14:41:01 Looks like people that #deletefacebook is growing, if you invested in #Facebook you better sell stocks, a year worth of profit is gone, and will not come back up.

1682 2018-03-26 14:40:21 An "assault rifle" is a made up term to use to try to ban rifles some people think look scary because they have hand grips as well as stocks and look something like automatic weapons but which fire one shot per one trigger pull.  It's a rifle.
1683 2018-03-26 14:40:10 Last week’s selloff in technology stocks stole the spotlight, but investors should be paying attention to an intensifying rout in bank stocks, too. The SP500’s financial sector tumbled 3% on Friday, the steepest decline out of its 11 sectors.
1684 2018-03-26 14:39:54 I mean Oil, Gas, Mining stocks were actually HIGHER when the commodities that support them were at HALF their current value???
1685 2018-03-26 14:38:59 Charles you have been providing market commentary and research for a very long time. In the current market is there ANY REASON to own anything but BIG Tech and 50% of the Dow? If so how stable is a market when only a hand full of stocks can SERIOUSLY RALLY?
1686 2018-03-26 14:38:42 It’s called the stormy distraction! Just like banning bump stocks on the day of the march. These clowns have a list of things they should be doing for the good of the country but they hold them until they need to change the narrative.

1695 2018-03-26 14:36:32 Why are you asking for a use to justification? Just say you do not want people to have MGs and bump stocks, I'll understand that.

To answer though; there are competitions with MGs, some people would like to collect and shoot them (the reason varys as to why).
1696 2018-03-26 14:36:30 It likely makes no sense for u to sell. #FederalReserve will never let stocks drop enough.
1697 2018-03-26 14:35:59 you & I both know our guns aren’t going to be taken away anytime soon as it is such a controversy however, there has been proposals banning bump stocks, increasing background checks, increasing age limit requirements, etc. I believe in our right to bear arms but reform is a NEED
1698 2018-03-26 14:35:41 Tough to do - the further you pull back the chart, the harder the nuance to see. Notably in 2014 stocks kept going up after oil plunged (due to #OPEC). In 2008, they both were crushed. #OOTT
1699 2018-03-26 14:35:38 Because this whistleblower said he'd made Novochok.

There is a big difference between certified destruction of declared stocks and having no chemical weapons at all.

I agree that the allegations are politically charged but there is evidence against both. Not conclusive evidence

1708 2018-03-26 14:32:02 Shwag, agree.  Bump stocks are ridiculous, 30 rounds per clip is too much and background checks for all selling outlets should be a no-brainer for politicians.  I know you care as do I, and you're obviously a very good person.  Keep up the good work!

1737 2018-03-26 14:24:55 When the demands are to: 1) universal background check. 2) Ban bump stocks. 3) Ban high capacity magazine. 4) Ban Military style weapons. 5) have ppl get license (trained) and register their guns. No, I REALLY don’t see any hypocrisy.

1763 2018-03-26 14:14:57 Banking stocks had a good run today particularly PSU banks. SBI looks good in the chart. We can confirm it tomorrow.
1764 2018-03-26 14:14:24 What makes no sense are folks like you who think someone’s going to take away all their guns! (That’s paranoia & lack of comprehension skills). You can keep handguns & rifles. But not bump stocks & not assault weapons. You’ve been brainwashed by the NRA, honey.
1765 2018-03-26 14:14:14 Get rid of bump stocks and reopening the civilian Machine Gun registry is reasonable because it was the closing of the registry that created bump stocks in the first place.

1766 2018-03-26 14:13:24 Our national conversation has become a partisan brawl. I'm a vet, who respects the #2A, and I support common sense #GunReform. Both parties are playing political games with our children's safety. 
1. Ban bump stocks, cranks.
2. Push for state level solutions. #Congress is frozen.

1768 2018-03-26 14:12:20 Based on what?  Stocks tumbled by over 1200 points by the end of last week.  Sure they are trying to recover today but, you are a FAILURE as a leader.  You are a FAKE President.  There is some Stormy weather in your future court appearances.

1786 2018-03-26 14:04:19 Re-instate Fed. Assault Weapons Ban. Make illegal: bump stocks, over-sized magazines, armor piercing bullets and silencers. All 5-8 mil. assault weapons should be rendered non fire-able at owners' expense, then owners can keep em as collector pieces. Universal background checks.
1787 2018-03-26 14:04:18 Hey Moron IN Chief, Obama didn't legalize Bump Stocks. Bump stocks started in 2005 after the Assault Weapons Ban was let to expire by the GOP.
1788 2018-03-26 14:04:17 As Gun companies file bankruptcies, with #boycottNRA getting results and #MarchForOurLives is a huge success, #momsDemandAction fights pro-gun bills everywhere, #NRA is getting desperate for existence. 
Bump stocks ban, gun control laws in red states, CDC gun research kicks #NRA

1790 2018-03-26 14:03:42 Is equitysim a platform to simulate trading stocks?
1791 2018-03-26 14:03:35 FL legislature passed law earlier this month to
raise min age to purchase a firearm to 21-
extended the waiting period to three days-
banned “bump stocks”-
funded more school police officers & mental health services-
allowed certain staff members to carry guns in schools-
1792 2018-03-26 14:03:33 Prior to the open on Wall Street, today was the first day of the year that stocks were cheaper than their long-term average on a forward PE basis ... that seems to explain the early rally!

1798 2018-03-26 14:00:52 Anyone who knows anything about history knows it doesn't start with govt seizing guns. It starts with banning bump stocks,  high capacity magazines, etc.

Silencers, bump stocks, barrell coolers and flash guards arent covered by the second amendment.. neither are large capacity magazines..

1808 2018-03-26 13:58:21 Way more obviously, to be able to so easily buy a gun, bump stocks etc isn’t good. However, the NRA May promote safety but when it comes to being actually able to do something about it, they don’t, they have the influence to but don’t use it positively

1810 2018-03-26 13:57:59 @jimcramer   I would think that a large number of Chinese upper class are invested in US stock companies. Apple, BA etc. Maybe they are buying US stocks at a discount.
1811 2018-03-26 13:57:15 Also: Can we all agree, bump stocks should be super illegal to own since they allow semi auto rifles to function as essentially full auto?
1812 2018-03-26 13:57:10 Stop watching NRA TV. It’s filling you with up with propanda. Your fear is palpable. Try listening. No one wants your guns. We want our kids safe. We want it more difficult to buy guns like AR-15’s and bump stocks and magazines with hundreds of bullets.

1818 2018-03-26 13:56:08 I never say anything personal about @DLoesch. But I will say she deflects, distracts and claims false equivalency as a routine argument. Just defend bump stocks, semiautomatic rifles, large capacity magazines on their own merits. Don’t bring up irrelevant BS.
1819 2018-03-26 13:54:51 Despite #gold trading above Friday's high, and above the physiological $1,350 resistance level, gold stocks are still well below their Friday highs.  This confirms that few traders actually believe this gold rally is real.  They are in for a rude awakening!

1824 2018-03-26 13:53:48 Agree with @DanCliftonStrat that trade concerns wiping out all the gains in stocks since the tax reform process started seems like an overreaction. Congress delivered $800bln of fiscal policy stimulus compared to a total of $37bln of tariffs. #Economics #Markets

1842 2018-03-26 13:50:50 Some of us are expecting they dump at some point and buy gold so the price of gold stocks soars. Otherwise they cant buy anything else with that immerse dollar pool. Of course they could build Africa's infrastructure if they would see long term.

1864 2018-03-26 13:43:39 Obama made bump stocks legal. Not Trump. OBAMA. 

Why? 

Because the political party that funds Planned Parenthood doesn't care about losing a few lives if it helps them end the 2nd Amendment.

Obama made bump stocks legal so it would all blow up.. and Libs would use to win..
1865 2018-03-26 13:43:16 Obama did not legalize bump stocks.  The GOP Congress did.   How stupid are you

1877 2018-03-26 13:38:18 LOL given how the stocks are performing the past few days since your tariffs are announced. Those are simply LIES. Only the mega riches are benefiting from your tax cuts and feel that things are going well. For everyone else, things are looking less rosy!
1878 2018-03-26 13:38:03 I'm a veteran as well, and I assure you, my skills with an M16/AR15 are formidable. And if like you say, an AR is no match, then why is it the target of gun bans? 

I'm not at all against sensible gun control. We have too many loopholes. We allow bump stocks. (1)

1893 2018-03-26 13:35:01 No it isnt. I don't think all people are blaming the NRA for his actions. I think they are blaming them for blocking certain gun laws from being made. Like raising the age to 21, getting rid of bump stocks, or universal background checks. NRA is the largest lobbiest group in USA

1896 2018-03-26 13:34:05 $LTE.V. You make the most amount of money off when you find stocks that are mispriced.  The market clearly doesn’t understand he impact of this Gigaclear deal.  These are the opportunities when you should be happy the market doesn’t understand.  Buy low sell high.
1897 2018-03-26 13:33:43 Seriously? Remember the high numbers of stock prices you were taking credit for a few months ago?  Since your stupid tariffs move, stocks have fallen hundreds of points. Explain that, will you?  Your economic policies are a disaster.
1898 2018-03-26 13:33:33 Background checks, banning assault weapons, waiting periods & mental health checks do not infringe on the 2nd Amendment rights to bear arms.

Ammo restrictions and magazine capacity restrictions? Wouldn't even make a dent in gun violence.

2012 2018-03-26 12:48:35 Apparently you do not own stocks.
2013 2018-03-26 12:47:25 ~ 27% of the $SPY is over 100 day MA. The other 400 stocks are extremely oversold.  Then again the big money dosent own those names. $DJIA
2014 2018-03-26 12:47:19 oh and doing great?  Mass shootings at our schools, stocks tanking, the people are disgusted by you and your swamp.  WE WANT YOU AND PENCE IMPEACHED!
2015 2018-03-26 12:46:03 Market Update: stocks trading sharply higher on easing trade tensions.
2016 2018-03-26 12:45:54 Can we get some fuckin suppressors yet? Idgaf about bump stocks, I want to have my hearing protected while enjoying the last of my gun rights before you shit sticks try taking them.
2017 2018-03-26 12:45:39 Yes, but considering it’s the gun that we hear about the most, we should look into banning it to see if it helps. Also, with the help of bump stocks, an ar-15 can be turned into an automatic. While something is being done with bump stocks. I fear it may not be enough.
2018 2018-03-26 12:45:00 Because may be stocks in possession by 31st March will be eligible in portfolios. So may be good strategy to buy only quality names where correction was muted.
2019 2018-03-26 12:44:54 No "compromise" re: our Constitution. 
Sick of hearing "sensible" or "common sense" w/o actual definition of such. 
Let's hear what that actually is. So far we've heard everything from bump stocks to get rid of the 2nd Amendment. And laws NOT followed pre MSD.
2020 2018-03-26 12:44:33 I’m a huge 2A supporter and I’ll admit bump stocks are unnecessary. But this issue isn’t about necessity. The idea that people want to regulate weapon types and accessories rather than regulating dangerous people through proper due process is ridiculous.
2021 2018-03-26 12:43:48 Would you like a copy of my stock? Maybe my bank balance? That 12$ a month isn't helping me, my stocks have tanked but we all doing good? question how much is a loaf of bread, gal.of milk? Lb of hamburger? I'll wait. ..try Google
2022 2018-03-26 12:43:41 If rules change, only those who follow the rules are affected... 

I'm hearing there's DB transfers taking place without suitability letters. If that's happening, then there's much bigger elephants in the room! 

Did I perhaps dream about TCF, RDR, COBS et al?
2023 2018-03-26 12:43:25 Born with a right to no background checks? Born with the right to use an AR-15? Born with a right to use bump stocks?  Seriously Joe - become an advocate for sensible change.

2036 2018-03-26 12:38:33 My stocks don’t say the economy is “looking really good.” The last I heard, “Now they have a great future, and it’s just beginning!" And then I heard the economy was "gloomy" and had "no hope" before YOU won. Luckily, your money laundering has kept you out of stock investments.

2040 2018-03-26 12:36:44 I think the wall is just vanity for trump. Maybe he has stocks in a cement/construction company. He is profiting from the presidential office. But if the thing is going to be approved then the $ needs to come from the defense budget. Stop taking $ from other programs.

2076 2018-03-26 12:13:22 Nothing in the 2A about the right to own machine guns - Reagan put strict regulations on those.

2077 2018-03-26 12:13:14 This is just unfair market manipulation. He makes claims like this when his stocks went down the day before, in hopes that they'll come back up based on a presidential claim before the Dow Jones opens.

2079 2018-03-26 12:10:49 In all his interviews he claims that the market seems overvalued as per his CAPE ratio but that doesn’t mean it can’t keep going up. He has been saying he’s not out of stocks because he thinks there’s still room to run up.

2081 2018-03-26 12:10:05 Big surprise - our delusional president is lying on this (or maybe he is just uninformed - take your pick).  Republicans blocked Obama from banning bump stocks.  But then, this is Friday Trump - by Tuesday he'll have changed his position.

2093 2018-03-26 12:04:30 BS - there are plenty of specific gun reform ideas that people want in place. Banning bump stocks and high magazines, requiring background checks on all gun sales and psych evals as well. Closing the boyfriend loophole. Gun control advocates are talking, you're not listening

2106 2018-03-26 11:59:53 The thing is the argument for why you want guns is compatible with much more restrictions and making people do much more to be able to own and maintain continued ownership of a gun. Also tri bursts and bump stocks and things like that are unneeded imo & could be banned outright

2123 2018-03-26 11:56:13 Remington's bankruptcy will cause gun stocks to drop today.....
2124 2018-03-26 11:53:20 Bump stocks became legal under Obama. The law would have allowed Obama to stop them from staying in the market. Just like the Law allowed Trump to get Bump Stocks OFF the market . It is really that simple. #tool
2125 2018-03-26 11:53:04 The Market...not just stocks...is at a low bc of your pathetic "Tarrif War". The Fed increased interest rates for the 3rd time last week since you took office.  CPI, GNP & GND are all over the place. If this was your attempt at a diversion...epic FAIL
2126 2018-03-26 11:52:29 CTS Futures system once again starts the day short $SPX, $NDX, $RUT & $MID. $SPX needs to gain almost 70 points for $ES $ES_F buy stops to trigger. $NDX needs over 300 points for $NQ $NQ_F buy stops to trigger. Watch to see if they close the gap. #Trading #stocks #Futures #Stormy
2127 2018-03-26 11:51:42 ingat k dyan idol. bute kapa nakatouchdown kna NOW. yung ibang stocks di pa nglland.
2128 2018-03-26 11:51:32 If that is the price to be paid I still don't care, getting off this exchange is a very good development, nobody wants his coins to be lost in transit for an unknown (long) period of time. Seems like Stocks is also losing alot of volume on their total exchange, let it bleed out!
2129 2018-03-26 11:51:13 Today will help (assuming strength holds), but as of Friday’s close, more than 35% of S&P 500 stocks closed below their February 9 lows
2130 2018-03-26 11:50:53 What are you looking at because my stocks are taking a dump? Please resign and do everyone a favor.
2131 2018-03-26 11:49:12 The only reason the stocks are up so high is because of President Trump. The stock market started going up the day he got elected
2132 2018-03-26 11:47:08 Not here in Oklahoma. Stocks falling and not a single person I know is making a penny more.
2133 2018-03-26 11:46:57 Benchmark indices closed sharply higher as the Sensex was up 469.87 points or 1.44 percent at 33,066.41 and the Nifty gained 132.65 points or 1.33 percent at 10,130.70, banking stocks rally.
2134 2018-03-26 11:46:50 Well no. More companies are laying off employees, the added jobs are not really a gain. Wages rose 0.1%. Gas gas risen 20 cents, in spring. General Mills has announced higher food prices. Others. Following?Stocks are more volatile. Your peers are doing ok, but they are rich.
2135 2018-03-26 11:45:25 A Bear Market? not happening, it’s called a Correction. Look back at similar circumstances and even with the Fed rates being adjusted it will not deter the Bull Market for years to come. The markets already took into account the Fed rate and some stocks, not all, were overvalued.
2136 2018-03-26 11:45:23 Outside of China, other negatives for risk appetite remain intact.  The #FederalReserve is intent on taking away the punch bowl, US financial conditions continue to tighten and #FANG #stocks are unwinding.  #Markets #Trading #Fed
2137 2018-03-26 11:45:02 Gotta really start tracking these stocks and not just trades. Bout to go ham and spend 60 hours on excel videos
2138 2018-03-26 11:44:47 How about those stocks?
2139 2018-03-26 11:44:43 Benchmark indices closed sharply higher as the Sensex was up 469.87 points or 1.44 percent at 33,066.41 and the Nifty gained 132.65 points or 1.33 percent at 10,130.70, banking stocks rally.
2140 2018-03-26 11:44:38 Rising rates is never bullish for stocks, never
2141 2018-03-26 11:44:22 "Come soon while the choice is at its best" sounds so much nicer than "Hurry while stocks last".

2144 2018-03-26 11:43:29 Making money in Stock Market needs a lot of patience, control, analytical study, and most importantly, holding capacity. Those who wish to make handsome gains overnight should forget making money in stocks.
2145 2018-03-26 11:43:10 Is that why my stocks are now in the negative? Bring back Obama!
2146 2018-03-26 11:42:33 Obama made bump stocks legal though.

2154 2018-03-26 11:38:04 The first gun company that will most likely start selling rocks with bump stocks for school protection. Shame on a military that would ever think about a weapon that would go as far as to kill an enemy:(

2156 2018-03-26 11:37:40 Did Aphria executives hold shares in a takeover target and not disclose it? Nice to see #potstocks are as compromised as regular #stocks
2157 2018-03-26 11:37:33 Absolutely. Doing the right thing. How lucky they are there so you can earn some dosh.
2158 2018-03-26 11:37:13 Strong possibility that Stock Market will have a monster week as fears of trade war subside. Backroom negotiations btwn US Gov’t and China and substantial progress will be announced soon. @realDonaldTrump setting up a big Win for the Stockmarket.  #stocks #TradeWar
2159 2018-03-26 11:37:01 Sarah Huckabee said that if the Dems wanted to have more gun control why didn't they do it when they had the control of all three branches? Pres Trump asked why didnt Pres Obama ban bump stocks? Instead Pres Obama made them legal. 
Like Daca, its about votes
2160 2018-03-26 11:36:58 Thanks buttercup, my point is stocks are falling because of an unnecessary trade war. Why don’t you take your graph back to 2009 when the DIA was at 6900
2161 2018-03-26 11:36:45 Need to work on render, imo it doesn't blend that good with the stocks you used
2162 2018-03-26 11:36:39 They are well aware we all think it's shit and all us actors don't wanna be there. Doesn't mean I don't come in and put my full effort into my job. Gotta pay the bills somehow. :)

2169 2018-03-26 11:33:29 Of course they should. Actually, let's flog them in public and put them in stocks and throw tomatoes at them. I mean they did after all, scratch a ball that the umpire didn't even see fit to change.

2180 2018-03-26 11:30:59 Forget Hillary and Obama.  Why don’t you address what his Administration or lack of one is doing to this country.  My stocks are way down. That is my retirement my livelihood.  Healthcare is a joke,his own Congress could not do it.wake up

2190 2018-03-26 11:21:23 @Scaramucci I was beginning to think u were reasonable for a moment on CNN then you started comparing the White House to a startup & denying that much of positive economic activity is continuation. Tax bill helped stocks, yes, but the WH, in disarray, lies to public amidst chaos.
2191 2018-03-26 11:21:21 Stop blowing smoke. Stocks will take a hit again today.
2192 2018-03-26 11:20:49 Huh? I was just correcting you since you said "Also ‘bump stocks jam’.  So do ARs.". I was simply letting you know that it was incorrect.

Sorry for wanting to spread correct information. Also in my other reply you can see I clearly have no problem banning them.
2193 2018-03-26 11:20:42 Is that why companies are buying their own stocks with their tax cuts instead of hiring more workers like you promised? Or is that why some companies are going to lose money because of your #TradeWar with China and non existing steel #tariffs ?
2194 2018-03-26 11:19:32 No, the stocks have taken a dive.

2207 2018-03-26 11:15:42 Still lying, not surprising, the republicans for eight years refused to work with the REAL President, Barack Obama. Bump stocks must go, it's a ban on ASSAULT RIFLES that you won't touch and they too must go. Your smoke screen won't work. In November you will see.

2215 2018-03-26 11:13:30 Another low week at the stock markets and you take credit for the economy. Although not directly tied together, stocks & economy do affect each other negatively. It takes time to show up. Will you ever take responsibility for the fall of the future of America?
2216 2018-03-26 11:13:23 We figured you meant losing and not moving. But the advice still holds! Not sure how old you are but if you're investing for at least 5 years, the odds of losing money in a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds is very low!
2217 2018-03-26 11:13:17 I was watching a video about Bump stocks.

Those things are crazy!
Who invented it!? Why is it legal!?
It's interesting... But they say one was used in the Vegas shooting.

And i guess bump stocks make your semi auto guns have a higher fire rate?
2218 2018-03-26 11:13:06 Wasnt obama  the one who actually legalized bump-stocks?
2219 2018-03-26 11:13:02 Bump stocks don't jam, they're a chunk of plastic. Bump stocks cause the AR to jam.

Also, name one other massacre that was done with a bump stock. They've been around for decades, shouldn't be too hard, right?

2224 2018-03-26 11:11:43 Hi Claire, we aim to retain 6 days of stocks at anytime in order to meet the requirements of patients. Additionally, the demand for blood has been decreasing, due to improvements in practice, meaning the demand for AB+ blood is at its lowest level for over a decade.
2225 2018-03-26 11:11:20 I think you may need to take another look at your view. Let's see stocks crash, traid war with no winners,  low unemployment =higher wages results in price increases.  Were screwed.  Thanks T Rump.

2235 2018-03-26 11:03:01 Sensex, Nifty rebound from two-day losing streak; banks recover: (Reuters) - Indian shares snapped a two-day losing streak on Monday as a recovery in financial stocks such as Yes Bank Ltd offset declines in IT stocks such as Wipro Ltd.
2236 2018-03-26 11:02:53 As long as #Trump’s twitter feed stays silent we might be off to a better start today.  Beijing & Washington reported as negotiating trade.  Stocks up in Asia and Europe.

2245 2018-03-26 10:54:28 Their long term goal is to fully disarm the law abiding public. Don't fall for the "we just wanna ban bump stocks" BS. You can't give the loony left an inch.
2246 2018-03-26 10:54:25 According to your president, Barack Obama legalized bump stocks

2248 2018-03-26 10:54:07 I believe all that will happen with gun laws is not being able to purchase semi automatic weapons untill 21,ban on bump stocks.More extensive background checks,some sort of check on mental health issues.I dont think that's anything to stir up hysteria over, which the NRA is doing
2249 2018-03-26 10:53:53 There's a big difference between "approving" something and being prohibited from banning it. Read that whole article. The President didn't have the legal authority to ban bump stocks, so when the issue came up, he had to "allow" them.

2261 2018-03-26 10:43:34 You want to ban bump stocks? I am fine with that. You want background checks? Great. But before you start getting all fired up happy, both of those will have no effect if the law isn’t enforced. Parkland never should have happened under existing law. You don’t need a new one.
2262 2018-03-26 10:43:15 Wont happen ever i think with this volatilities. When people want to reduce risk they still sell crypto, stocks and go to less riskier assets.

2281 2018-03-26 10:29:16 No "line", either followed or trailed, thank god. Fishing stocks are a fragile natural commons that should be managed with collective, intergovernmental wisdom. Scots fishermen I'm sure not that much worse than any other shortsighted sector. But not noticeably better.

2287 2018-03-26 10:25:45 This. Opposing bump stock bans was never about bump stocks. It's merely acknowledging that any confession to these people is pointless. They want all guns banned and won't stop until that happens.
2288 2018-03-26 10:25:37 Nobody, really nobody forces you to store your property in a currency. Buy stocks, real estate, BitCoins, whatever, all legal.
2289 2018-03-26 10:25:22 Oh yeah I get what you're saying now, apologies I'm sleep deprived and didn't quite understand what you were arguing for.

I think like most of this gun debate, the call of ban bump stocks is mostly fueled by misinformation.

2299 2018-03-26 10:19:53 News on @Midlands984: Blood stocks sufficient:NBSZ

The National Blood Services Zimbabwe @NBSZbloodbank chief executive officer Lucy Marowa says the current levels of blood in the national blood bank are enough to meet a surge in demand expected during the coming Easter holidays.
2300 2018-03-26 10:19:23 I'm actually totally in favor of a permanent ban on assault style rifles, bump stocks, hand grenades, stupidity, Steve King, and Nazis. I'd really, really like to ban Nazis. Who else is with me?
2301 2018-03-26 10:18:57 Yup for sure, it's a simple mechanism. That doesn't do anything to remedy the issues I stated above. The idea of bump stocks have been around for a long time, there's a reason they're never used in shootings.
2302 2018-03-26 10:18:36 I whom'st'd elevated like deep stocks !! :(

2304 2018-03-26 10:15:23 Also bump stocks are terrible. They make the gun horrible inaccurate and are prone to jamming your rifle. Vegas was the only mass shooting that used a bump stock, and he could have without a doubt killed more people if he actually aimed each shot.

2330 2018-03-26 09:54:30 Could you at least see why bump stocks may be a step too far? Surely an unmodified or altered AR-15 should be enough deterrent per citizen, against the threat of tyranny? Not being a troll, serious question.

2499 2018-03-26 07:27:25 Some weed stocks don't give a damn as well.
2500 2018-03-26 07:26:05 Anyone can turn a semi-auto into a full auto. It only takes a few minutes. Please don't ban bump stocks.
2501 2018-03-26 07:26:01 Psei is a gambling investment. Fundamentals rarely works. Anyone amassed with money can try your luck in stocks mostly in red all year round.
2502 2018-03-26 07:24:20 4 of them I’ve done extensive DD on and are prominent in my portfolio...VHI, SX, GRAT, and RKS...and most others you mentioned are on a watch list...some even though they’re good stocks; share price is too expensive where leverage could be used elsewhere. I heavy into PKG too

2508 2018-03-26 07:19:39 Though, we must not shy away from demanding that such reforms involve outright bans on weapons like the AR-15 and accessories such as bump stocks and magazines exceeding 7-10 rounds.

2514 2018-03-26 07:14:05 The long-term investor's returns gets a big boost from market crashes. Crashes are a great opportunity for buying tomorrow's stocks at yesterday's prices. 

If you missed out in 2002 or in 2008, don't miss out now.

2524 2018-03-26 07:02:42 STOP with the LIES!!!  The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives that determined bump stocks are a "firearm part" and could NOT be regulated as a firearm under existing gun laws, so the Obama administration could NOT prohibit it.
2525 2018-03-26 07:01:35 Someone gave me a good advice recently DM'ing on Twitter saying, hone your skills to very few selected stocks and trade index if good with charts...that's what I have been doing since past few days and it's going pretty well in terms of building capital. Less stress too.

2529 2018-03-26 06:58:53 Re: AR-15s they have already been ruled to not be covered by 2nd Amendment so they can be banned or restricted use by age and bump stocks as they change the function of a weapon to make it like something that is already illegal can also be banned legally.

2539 2018-03-26 06:52:56 If the news ends up being true, then initially you will see Italian stocks get smashed and BTPs rally (while bunds ramp and BTPs-Bunds widen). 

Think will be similar px action to what gilts did post-Brexit.

What do you think?
2540 2018-03-26 06:52:06 Actually, read DC v Heller and you'll find that #2A is not the barrier to universal background check, restricting bump stocks and hi-cap mags, or even AR-15 class firearms. It's just NRA fraud.

Everything the kids are asking for will survive a SCOTUS challenge.

2544 2018-03-26 06:48:46 We already know the place of common ground. Ban bump stocks. Pass Red Alert laws. Pass child access laws. Ban large clips. Ban AR-15s. Close all loopholes. That's the compromise, the common ground.

2551 2018-03-26 06:42:02 There is common ground, you pedantic twit. Look at the polls and even gun owners want these guns and bump stocks banned, and full background and psychological evaluations implemented.
2552 2018-03-26 06:41:04 Emails.... uranium.... oh yeah, bump stocks
2553 2018-03-26 06:40:31 Senator, to your point about making a difference, the *vast majority* of Americans support banning assault-style weapons and bump stocks. Why don't you? 

Hello?

2554 2018-03-26 06:40:07 I'm not worried about my IT stocks with all the noise around trade war etc. Skilled engineers can't be replaced by school dropouts overnight.
2555 2018-03-26 06:39:09 Indian stock market has bottomed out. Buy these Tech breakout stocks- Shoppers stop, TTK Healthcare, Minda Industries, Dynamatic Technologies
2556 2018-03-26 06:38:50 And this book isn't much about stocks, but more about the housing market, the crisis that followed, interest rates, international trade deficits, involvement of govt, central banks and policy makers etc and some things Rajan believes will improve the status quo.
2557 2018-03-26 06:35:29 Biggest question .... In an economy like ours, which would you buy ? #intelligentinvestor #MFSahihai #Valueinvesting #moneymaking #stocks #investment #investments
2558 2018-03-26 06:35:14 As should licensing & registration of guns and ammunition. There is zero reason for a civilian to own a semi automatic rifle, Large capacity magazines, bump stocks & conversion kits etc and they should be banned.

2560 2018-03-26 06:34:07 S&P is a much larger index and therefore, the impact is more. Equal weighting is equivalent to doing a mid cap tilt on the index, and over the long run, smaller stocks outperform the larger ones. Sundaram has BSE100 equal weight ETF.
2561 2018-03-26 06:33:28 Duke loses, stocks rally

2562 2018-03-26 06:33:17 There are many companies which are available at good valuations and downside looks limited. The Index may fall further but those stocks may resist selling pressure. Study such companies and decide at what levels you would like to invest.

2570 2018-03-26 06:24:38 Indian shares edged marginally lower on Monday, dragged by oil refiners such as Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd and IT stocks such as Infosys Ltd, as concerns of a looming trade war between the United States and China continued to hurt global sentiment.

2582 2018-03-26 06:10:48 So you are saying you oppose universal background checks, CDC studies on gun violence, and banning bump stocks? That's how your statement reads.  You need new PR people unless you enjoy the taste of shoe leather

They love to lie about their A2 being taken away
2586 2018-03-26 06:07:35 The best advice on picking stocks is to not pick stocks because its almost always a bad idea for retail investors. Unless your aim is to learn and not make money. Why not pick a sane mutual fund and forget about it?

2595 2018-03-26 06:00:13 ROI is more than 500% a year, it's a better result than you invest in stocks, equity, etc.
2596 2018-03-26 05:59:10 The so called " Bump stocks " have been around for a while but called something different...an akins accelerator I think. Before that there was Hellfire triggers. Because 800 rpm is needed for "person protection"...right?
2597 2018-03-26 05:58:53 #Nepse imposes circuit breaker after stocks plunged 3% is less than 1 hour. Trading is suspended now. Circuit breaker is imposed when there is extreme volatility in the market; apparently to give investors time to pause and review their trading decision.
2598 2018-03-26 05:57:38 Stop playing politics.  You know bump stocks aren't the problem.  We didn't elect you for this! We elected you to build a wall,  get rid of planned parent hood and government welfare, and get the government out of health care.  Do it!

2604 2018-03-26 05:55:12 A great rule for smart investing is to avoid emotional decisions as much as possible. Don’t follow the masses in a panic and keep a positive mindset. Base your decisions on thorough research and make sure to diversify your investments (ideally) in more expensive stocks.

2614 2018-03-26 05:50:20 If people looked up what he’s done in the past week .... bump stocks illegal. Which Obama decided for them. But the media twists everything. I’m proud atleast 
2615 2018-03-26 05:50:18 actually the internet traveling movement (I would not call it nomad because everyone travels for different reasons) started with the first iPhone and GPS in 2007. Before that rich people  worked from the road investing in stocks, etc. Kayak and travel engines came second.
2616 2018-03-26 05:50:01 I would say trade for him (if your league does mid season trading) but I imagine he wouldn't trade him with his ruck stocks so bare. You'll have to stick with Masten for this year but delist at the end of the year and get yourself a good kid.
2617 2018-03-26 05:50:00 The ONLY part of the argument that is bullshit is ANYONE thinking they need an AR-15 to protect themselves. No shit the bump stocks are a recent aftermarket device. But then again that adds to the point of who needs one to make a weapon designed for killing able to kill more.

Hell, the NRA is so deep in the pockets of the GOP we can't even ban bump stocks (which isn't about the lowest bar anyone could set.)

2623 2018-03-26 05:46:24 Kind of like telling a 2A nut that liberals own guns and hunt just like you. So we know you don’t need an AR15 or high capacity mag or bump stocks to go hunting or 4self defense. So those won’t be available to purchase anymore, But if you want 2shoot one, Ucan enlist &shoot away
2624 2018-03-26 05:45:25 You can't do much better than making the legal age to buy a firearm 21, banning bump stocks, and doing extensive background checks

2645 2018-03-26 05:33:45 My priorities are children not getting killed - I don't give a shit about your handgun or hunting rifle- no one needs assault rifles and bump stocks
2646 2018-03-26 05:33:40 Or a bump stick. That makes a semi automatic rifle able to fire faster. Well, you hold the rifle right and use it’s recoil well, you don’t need one of those, then they’ll want to ban all stocks. Soon it all comes to small parts of guns then all of them.
2647 2018-03-26 05:33:22 Fool. Doing away with bump stocks is meaningless. You have to outlaw the assault rifles bump stocks were made for first.
2648 2018-03-26 05:32:36 First bump stocks. What’s next? #BumpStocks aren’t the problem. Stop taking rights away from citizens!! @POTUS

2657 2018-03-26 05:25:35 BA / Dems actually did and the Republications promptly removed the background checks. Bump stocks r legal, not subject to executive order. U think arming teachers is the answer, i disagree.
2658 2018-03-26 05:25:09 The plan was obvs to get Preuss but some clown in my league took him. His ruck stocks are Ryder Preuss and Cox so he may have none this week (#justice). No one will trade for Masten so I'm stuck with him. Hoping Dom Tyson comes back soon.

2691 2018-03-26 04:59:18 Bump stocks are a add on and Only used in Vegas. There are several ways to get same result with just your index finger with little practice. If he didn’t have a AR15 any semi auto 30.06 or 308 would be used with greater power,accuracy and range. Think about if he choose those.

2696 2018-03-26 04:53:17 As an outsider looking in, I can't understand why the American gun lovers won't even consider the fact that the second amendment was written long before automatic weapons, semi automatic weapons and bump stocks were even thought of?

2701 2018-03-26 04:49:29 Good vid. I’m a stocks-guy but a crypto fan. $BTC will someday be a safe haven investment like gold and get a bid when stocks crash, but for now there are too many stocks-guys speculating in $BTC and when their stocks go down they will sell $BTC to cover losses...but someday...
2702 2018-03-26 04:48:07 Refer away. I am educated, have heard both sides, listened mindfully, and then made a decision on which side I’m on. I read, check stats, not just the ones that support my position. The public doesn’t need an AR-15, bump stocks and mega round rifles. Not saying take away guns.
2703 2018-03-26 04:48:01 Bump stocks only used once, Vegas. They cause weapons to overheat, jam and ruin accuracy. Yes he just sprayed, but you need accurate fire. Still somethings hazy about Vegas & Parkland. Weird failures by LEO'S/Security in both.
2704 2018-03-26 04:47:32 Wrong.
An "assault rifle" is a rifle with a selectable rate of fire. IE, semi-auto, 3 round burst, fully automatic.
An "assault weapon" is a term produced a few dacades ago to classify weapons with detachable mags and pistol grips, folding stocks, flash-hiders, and bayonet lugs.

2709 2018-03-26 04:42:45 it's more like a ding dong, it just scales with rage weirdly. I think I took your stocks around 60 to 70 other than the one at like 16, but that was only because you hopped up on my platform lol
2710 2018-03-26 04:42:32 That is somewhere where we can find common ground. I do no support bump stocks at all.
2711 2018-03-26 04:41:42 While I understand the emotion and anger, she can't expect everyone to agree and act on it. Should have taken time to grieve. Sensible is a matter of opinion and should not be based on emotion. Couldn't care less about bump stocks, but banning AR-15 is not sensible in my opinion.
2712 2018-03-26 04:41:21 What's the justification for needing assault weapons, semi-automatics, bump stocks, stockpiling weapons and ammunition and buying weapons with limited background checks?
2713 2018-03-26 04:41:11 Not nifty stocks broader weakness... Oil companies are weak.. Down 1 to 3% hpcl ioc n bpcl... Which r keeping nifty weak 2 day... I guess
2714 2018-03-26 04:41:09 AR15s or bump stocks have been used in every single mass shooting as of late. This is not flavor of the month. This is flavor or the terrorist. ARs happen to be the preferred method of mass murder for white men. Why is this? Because it's easy. Because it takes no effort.
2715 2018-03-26 04:40:29 I’m wasn’t a fan of Obama but he didn’t make bump stocks legal. He didn’t make them illegal. Bump stocks have no moving parts so the law did not permit him to prohibit them. 
But I criticized him and I’ll continue to criticize Trumps antics.
2716 2018-03-26 04:40:21 That's fair enough. I enjoy both F/A and T/A and once you have a system you kind of just remember a lot about most companies you trade and I keep journals for anticipated Ann dates etc on most stocks that I trade and have traded. Then it comes down to updating each new Ann.

2730 2018-03-26 04:33:28 No one is calling for a Constitutional amendment! No one wants to take your guns!
We just want commonsense gun laws...background checks, age limits, no assault type weapons, hi cap clips or bump stocks. Stop the rabble rousing please & listen.
2731 2018-03-26 04:33:13 Cramer is a hack and the puppet of his hedge fund buddies.

I've seen him pump stocks that were ready to collapse. 

What Cramer says, do the opposite
2732 2018-03-26 04:31:56 Then I would have a serious look at and talk about banning things like tri burst, bump fire stocks etc. with serious penalty for violating it.

2734 2018-03-26 04:30:28 Red flag laws. Universal background checks. No bump stocks. CDC research. Magazine limits. On and on. But NRA absolutism won’t allow any discussion of any possible action whatsoever bc it’s all about increasing gun sales at all fucking costs.
2735 2018-03-26 04:28:31 GBP/USD: Focus on stocks: In such a scenario, the GBP/USD pair could revisit and may possibly break above the last week's high of 1.4218. Meanwhile, risk aversion could yield a pullback to 10-day moving average located at 1.4035. It is worth noting that British Pound still…
2736 2018-03-26 04:28:14 Still lots of interface related issues. Stocks not getting added to watchlist. Pending orders not showing up correctly. Risky doing any trades today.
2737 2018-03-26 04:28:10 So how is Trump banning bump stocks right now...without Congress's help...if Obama wanted , he could have done it.

2739 2018-03-26 04:27:53 NRA's playing with truth. 2nd Amend't gives us the right 2bear arms. But, NRA is also 4bump stocks, teens buying guns when they can't legally smoke yet, mentally ill people legally buying weapons & guns which can mow down a line of people in seconds. Unless ur a war,why an AR15?

2742 2018-03-26 04:25:01 Anytime I see anyone say "Ban bump stocks", I laugh at the lack of practical gun knowledge on display.
2743 2018-03-26 04:24:52 Books on #technicalanalysis of #stocks  Have read many. My book: If there is no bear market or world $$$$ crisis. (1) scan for 100 highest % gains in 13 weeks (2) Apply TA for breakouts, continuations, or moves off support (3) know when to put a stop loss order nice and tight
2744 2018-03-26 04:24:49 How's this for gun reform: 

1) add any weapon w/ muzzle velocity > 1500FPS  to NFA. 

2) Up NFA tax to $4000 to account for inflation. 

3) Ban bump stocks and magazines > 15 rounds

Hasn't answered my question on why 18-yer-olds need to buy AR-15s with bump stocks without any delay whatsoever either.
2746 2018-03-26 04:23:41 Lmao u only say that cause u obviously have no money in stocks or a 401k, guessing u got your own business and work from home right lmao
2747 2018-03-26 04:22:06 This weekend it happened. He announced that he would veto the bill then signed it instead. Then he talked about banning bumpfire stocks. He did all that on Friday knowing the media would be talking about the dimwits protesting their rights away on Saturday and Sunday.
2748 2018-03-26 04:21:52 Who would ever believe President Obama would legalize bump stocks? Yeah, he was a real gun guy that one. 
2749 2018-03-26 04:20:54 Ew don't tag me with sheep wolf.
2750 2018-03-26 04:19:59 The Wall Street Journal isn’t always accurate as anticipated. Trust me. They had reported that Arsenal football club’s shareholder was planning to make AC Milan FC a sister club and introduce them to the international stocks. Plus it hasn’t happened. 
2751 2018-03-26 04:19:07 Read up on the demographics and the fact younger people want 0 to do with stocks or gold. Old fart money. They live in an augmented reality where VR is in their thinking. CryptoKitties gets major funding from a Silicon Valley VCs?  Are you following this deeply?
2752 2018-03-26 04:19:01 @NancyCNBC @cnbcSri Goodmorninh Thanks for the Show today, re.Oil market, the question is as the shift in US administration staff means the shift of focus in market from stocks price rise to commodity price rise! maybe it happens but still too early !
2753 2018-03-26 04:17:36 Hardly anyone knew of bump stocks. Trump is a compulsive liar. He can't help himself & will never stop. I hope that as Americans we stand & never allow this to happen to us again.
2754 2018-03-26 04:16:10 Trump passed more gun laws in 1 day than Obama did in 8 years. Shows who REALLY cares about the issue. AND Obama made bump stocks legal. #ObamaHatesKids
2755 2018-03-26 04:15:57 NO!  Obama DID NOT legalize bump stocks like Trump claims.  

The law simply did not allow Obama to prohibit bump stocks.  If congress wanted to regulate them they could have.  

President Trump is WRONG! Bump stocks weren't considered an issue until after the Vegas shootings.

2758 2018-03-26 04:14:15 Also have a look on pharmaceutical stocks too....... They are suffering a lot.....  They need care and attention and treatment.
2759 2018-03-26 04:14:08 Stores that sell guns now refusing to sell rifles to 18-year-olds who are legally required to register for the selective service, bump stocks outlawed, guns being confiscated in FL, Trump calls for taking guns without due process...

2763 2018-03-26 04:11:42 Courts decide what's legal when EOs and legislation are challenged. Obama didn't try to ban bump stocks. Trump is trying, but mostly as a diversion from real gun control.

2774 2018-03-26 04:06:07 I believe that Paddock was the only massacre shooter to employ bump stocks. Certainly, he had adequate weapons and ammunition to do an equal amount of damage without using them. Why they aren't already banned is shocking, given that they basically convert an AR-15 into an M-16.
2775 2018-03-26 04:06:05 Trump is banning bump stocks, luring federal money towards mental health facilities in schools, allowing states to decide the legal age for gun purchases... what did Obama do? Tell me. Get out of here, I have valid reasons for what I believe.
2776 2018-03-26 04:05:45 You actually can with a SA shotgun.  Yes, the big clips can be regulated as can binary triggers and bump stocks, but more effective to limit access to them in the first place.

2783 2018-03-26 04:00:03 Banning bump stocks is only a bad idea if it's the only thing you're going to do, and that looks like what may be happening. Banning bump stocks in lieu of banning assault style weapons is less than a half measure.

2792 2018-03-26 03:51:49 Same thing goes for bump stocks as well. Gun manufacturers will simply label them as bicycle equipments or gaming products or gardening tools. Its like banning gun straps. As long as you dont call it a gun strap you can sell it, call it guitar strap or something.
2793 2018-03-26 03:51:30 Why is no one doing something?! File charges, suspend them without pay, put them in stocks in front of the Capitol. Anything to show how wrong they are for hi jacking our democracy.

2811 2018-03-26 03:37:56 A “moderate” group would support reasonable regulations on guns.  NRA does no such thing.  What regulations do they support to help end mass shootings?  Ban on bump stocks?  No.  Ban on high capacity mags?  No.  No ARs until 21? No.

2846 2018-03-26 03:13:53 I had hope for you, Marco, nationally. But you are puttering along following the NRA line. I've always voted for you...no more. If we can't even ban bump stocks when the NRA agrees, where is the hope?
2847 2018-03-26 03:12:13 My team will steer a client away from investing in stocks like GEO, or Blackwater or any other private prison provider.  The fact that you worked in this environment and believe you were a help is interesting to me.
2848 2018-03-26 03:11:15 Idk, banning bump stocks, wanting to keep Obamacare are just two instances that they’re functioning as one of the same. You can believe it’s outlandish all you want.
2849 2018-03-26 03:11:10 Please keep the GOP and Trump in power. My strategy of buying stocks in companies related to the most corrupt admin since @GovHard and protecting my downside with puts when they inevitably screw the pooch is killing it! I will keep going to the well until it runs dry.
2850 2018-03-26 03:11:00 25.5 wiped . Bit disappointed there wasn’t more end-of-the-world-is-near type of posts this morning, was hoping to score some trader stocks scared out of positions lower, darn it
2851 2018-03-26 03:11:00 I see what the stocks of private prison providers go for, there is money in keeping people incarcerated or having prisoners continue to go in and out of the prison system.  Until you address this, you are a part of the problem.

2853 2018-03-26 03:10:14 Maybe coach Gregg Popovich can remember when Obama was on vacation during crises. POTUS just signed regulation to make bump stocks illegal.
2854 2018-03-26 03:08:10 Banning bump stocks that were legalized under Obama, tightened/ federalized background checks and pouring billions into school safety The mentally ill you refer to? BOs rule was aimed only at ppl who had someone else take care of their finances like grandpa and disabled vets
2855 2018-03-26 03:07:50 2 close games with pc and nearly beat HP. I know I’m almost there. I just need to get better at closing last stocks.
2856 2018-03-26 03:07:47 Excess stocks and capacity still to be worked off
2857 2018-03-26 03:07:39 No, perhaps not but the anti-gun establishment calls any semi-automatic rifle with certain features an “assault rifle”.  Things like pistol grips and adjustable stocks make for a more accurate gun, whether in the field hunting or on the battlefield.  And the Second Amendment ....

2859 2018-03-26 03:06:26 1) define high velocity. 2) agree. Bump stocks are pointless. They make weapons less accurate and were dumb when the Obama admin allowed them. 3) National DB have plenty of problems with abuse 4) the. You must raise every other right to 21, including the right to vote (cont)

2862 2018-03-26 03:05:47 Last Thursday, President Trump announced that 50 billion dollars worth of tariffs on China and it will be very interesting to look at the stocks of companies who do their majority of business in China, such as Apple and Intel.

2864 2018-03-26 03:03:59 Don't be fooled by Portmans vote on FIX NICS, which NRA approved off.  It;s a watered down version to calm the masses.  Portman is still NRAs boy.  Still nothing on banning bump stocks or assault rifles.  NRA doesn't approve of those being banned.

2866 2018-03-26 03:01:20 Of course it is frightening! That's why I would rather have assult rifles & bump stocks, gone. If you are being taught that there is a chance that something bad could happen; it's scares you so much, that a child will be focused on the fear, instead of being able to learn.
2867 2018-03-26 03:01:12 Hood niggas but read up on shit about stocks and shit
2868 2018-03-26 02:59:24 "We need to ban assault rifles, bump stocks, and drum magazines!"
Those are already illegal
"Fucking NRA!"
2869 2018-03-26 02:57:45 1. Ban bump stocks.
2. Raise the minimum age to 21 for guns
3. All gun purchases need background checks
That's an easy start.
2870 2018-03-26 02:57:11 Just made sure to divest myself of any gun stocks tonight by contacting my financial advisor, and found that one of my ETFs (SPDR S&P 500 ETF TRUST from @statestreet) has a gun or ammo manufacturer in it; sold and dropped it! Goodbye!
2871 2018-03-26 02:55:23 which stocks tim?  Pot?
2872 2018-03-26 02:54:37 2. Yes, a ban on automatic guns, bump stocks, large capacity magazines can help solve mass shootings as can funding for education, healthcare, mental health support, and human services. You don’t vote well for the latter services.
Be better Marco. Stop playing partisan politics.
2873 2018-03-26 02:54:34 NO TO REPEAL THE 2ND AMENDMENT!!!"A WELL REGULATED MILITIA"THE REQUEST IS FOR ASSAULT WEAPONS & BUMP STOCKS FROM BEING SOLD. Age limit TO 21 Universal background Checks IS AN ASSAULT RIFLE WORTH EVEN 1 LIFE? CHILD OR ADULT THEIR SMILE LAUGHTER LOVE FAMILY FRIENDS
IS IT?
2874 2018-03-26 02:53:57 In fact they are ours anyway and in effect were merely leased to the countries of the EU. The danger is whether we prolong that arrangement or get beck to keeping more of our fish stocks for British consumption.

2887 2018-03-26 02:40:35 What do you have against comprehensive background checks?  Something to hide? Raising the age to buy guns to 21?  Banning bump stocks? Not selling to mentally ill, or anyone convicted of domestic assault?

What exactly do you NEED an assault rifle for?

2895 2018-03-26 02:36:51 But if you ask all those kids from all of those schools... they won’t care about those numbers. That’s why they’re trying to make schools safer. No one needs an AR-15. No one needs bump stocks! And mentally ill ppl shouldn’t have a gun. That’s their message!

2899 2018-03-26 02:35:37 I take your point, yet with respect, why can’t we expect this nation to add AR-15’s and bump stocks to the Federal list of generally banned items such as automatic weapons, silencers, mortars, M-14’s, etc?  Beyond that, require liability insurance on firearms. Tech is nice, but..
2900 2018-03-26 02:35:25 Do not be surprised if in the near future the stocks keep nose diving. Trump is on the road to bankrupt America. We will not let it happen to our country vote blue

2918 2018-03-26 02:28:50 I’m inclined to agree with you 
Bump stocks should be banned but there is a data base where people of authority can legally put people on the no buy list and Cruz should have been the community leaders failed
2919 2018-03-26 02:28:38 And the marches were not anti-2A, and this false information that we just want to take all guns away and abolish 2A is ridiculous. Reasonable gun control laws are just that, reasonable. A handgun can provide self defense. No need for AR-15’s, or bump stocks. That is not so hard.

2923 2018-03-26 02:27:15 Your rights for "a well regulated militia"? Have your guns, but let's have some protections from guns being too lethal (bump stocks) and getting into the hands of dangerous criminals and insane people.

2926 2018-03-26 02:25:58 Also, devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns are already banned. Bump stocks don’t do that. That’s why they’re legal. Like, doesn’t the President know these things? Ban the things, but please educate yourself in the process. Ugh.

2928 2018-03-26 02:25:30 Bump stocks were made legal under Obama. Does that bother you?
2929 2018-03-26 02:24:29 I made this primarily to be involved in all of the internet nonsense. I might also post about stocks, real estate and current events.
2930 2018-03-26 02:24:15 The Obama Administration did not “legalize bump stocks”, they simply found that there were no current laws in place to prohibit them, which there aren’t. Proud you’re fixing it, wish you didn’t have to point fingers in the process...it’s childish.
2931 2018-03-26 02:23:35 Thats ridiculous. I have addressed logical & real ideas 2 help better secure schools, improving backgrounds, and even agreeing to moving bump stocks to a class 3 device. Yes this Hogg kid is upsetting to watch, pushing illogical ideas with nastiness, so you are seeing responses.
2932 2018-03-26 02:23:12 And he is he is making bump stocks illegal something others didn’t
2933 2018-03-26 02:23:09 This is not what the students nor Democrats are asking for.  NICS by the way was passed and signed by the President last week to make tougher restrictions as was bump stocks banned.  Dems and students calling for ban
2934 2018-03-26 02:23:03 Remember Senator, congress makes the laws, exec. branch executes. This applies equally to bump stocks, immigration, DACA...all of it. Obama set a bad precedent trying to declare laws into existence. This tactic has divided our country to extreme levels.
2935 2018-03-26 02:22:59 It's an M16 that shoots slower. Thank God Trump is banning bump stocks, otherwise you could have a situation where a person put a bump stock on an AR-15 and would basically have an M16 in their hands -- oh wait. That's literally what happened in Vegas. 58 dead, 891 injured, btw.
2936 2018-03-26 02:22:55 They do not want to take away your guns or take away your 2nd amendment rights (which i believe is BS-its a privilege not a right). They don’t want AR-15 available or bump stocks or mentally ill getting guns! That’s it!
2937 2018-03-26 02:22:22 I hear the stocks on bitcoin are rising again so I will. Thanks for the tip!
2938 2018-03-26 02:22:16 Borrowing is spending money on yourself and handing your kids the bill. Never a fair deal unless it’s spent on long term assets (like infrastructure; but that’s better funded by tolls). Inflation taxes the stock of wealth. Like a land value tax for stocks. What’s wrong with that?
2939 2018-03-26 02:22:11 Hobby stocks to packing that’s hilarious
2940 2018-03-26 02:21:42 It seems like you are making up ideas to support your thesis rather than logically looking at the situation and taking the simplest solution from the circumstances. Lower count magazines, no trigger actuators, no bump stocks. That’s common sense gun law.
2941 2018-03-26 02:21:39 Yes, I think we can. And devices like bump stocks and high capacity magazines. But we also need mental health screening, and more comprehensive background checks.
2942 2018-03-26 02:21:38 Thanks will look into it but it has 175 million shares outstanding which im not a fan of. But will do some more dd
2943 2018-03-26 02:21:24 This is From Trump’s tweet 2 days ago.                             “Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA”.

2947 2018-03-26 02:20:04 Manager portfolio" who call the shots when buying and selling of stocks ? The account manager or the investor?
2948 2018-03-26 02:17:29 This is where a rules based approach is helpful.   As market starts to fall, stocks will start to break down and reach predetermined stops.  By the time the market gets in free fall you will already have been stopped out of many long positions.

2958 2018-03-26 02:09:51 Just one ting bro, Gun control/reform is to ban bump stocks, and military style automatic rifles like the AR-15. Deeper background checks and safety class requirements. The movement is not to ban all guns completely. I personally would own a firearm, just not an automatic rifle.
2959 2018-03-26 02:09:32 Looking for some #esports stock to invest in. If anyone knows any on the #tsx or #tsxv or #cse let me know. @CndStockTrader if you have a list of eports #stocks and would like to share i would appreciate it. Doing some DD for my next big investment

Maybe raising age limits, closing private sale loophole, banning bump stocks, having a mandatory wait before purchasing, banning AR-15's

Different people have different priorities, but that is generally the list.
2962 2018-03-26 02:07:43 Taking them stocks in the crew batttle
2963 2018-03-26 02:07:24 How many lies can our PRESIDENT tell ? Obama created Isis. Obama legalized bump stocks. Hillary and dems colluded with Russia. Putin didn't interfere in our elections
So do you really believe " No Collusion?" REALLY? I can get you the Brooklyn Bridge- cheap!
2964 2018-03-26 02:07:12 Common sense, like background checks on ALL sales, banning bump-stocks, no-fly list prohibitions, mental health checks, magazine load limits. You wanna have a gun? Fine, unless you are a domestic abuser or a potential suicide. And maybe AR15's are a stupid idea.
2965 2018-03-26 02:05:49 There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.
私たちの株式投資への意欲をそぐような要因がかなりある。１３１
2966 2018-03-26 02:05:28 We agree that needed to happen, however there’s more to be done than that. Banning bump stocks only addresses scenarios like Vegas, it does nothing for Parkland, Sandy Hook, Aurora, Orlando... I propose a public debate on Universal Backgrounds Checks, magazine capacity, loopholes
2967 2018-03-26 02:03:18 Well, the Vegas gunman had both.  Agreed that the majority of gun owners are lawful, security-conscious and don’t use these augmented weapons.  So to extend your point, #2A proponents wouldn’t miss ump stocks or AR 15s if banned?
2968 2018-03-26 02:02:13 I am a Democrat, I am a liberal, I am a woman and I own a gun. But I am for stricter gun laws, smaller ammo cases, no bump stocks or assault rifles and I know there should be stricter vetting to get a gun or to carry with longer wait times, & limit concealed by gun type and gauge
2969 2018-03-26 02:02:01 Everyone has a lot to say about bump stocks but don’t even know ab binary triggers educate yourself
2970 2018-03-26 02:01:16 I never sd that.  I want enforcement of the existing restrictions on fully-auto weapons & I think bump stocks should be outlawed since they create fully-auto firing.  Thx for noting taking away gun rights require an amendment. Wish all who comment knew the constitution as well.
2971 2018-03-26 02:00:55 You don’t know me from Adam, yet I rallied to see you elected. 

Bump stocks are a great start, but a real solution is limiting magazines that can hold no more than 5 rounds! 

Put that in place and you will dramatically make a change for students, police and security personnel!

2973 2018-03-26 02:00:00 I recently discovered Certified Financial Professionals / Advisors suggesting to take a line on your Home and investing it all in stocks as interest rates are so low. This is horrible advice. Don't do it, it's ludicrous! Axe any Advisor that tells you this! #CFP #Canada #Opinion
2974 2018-03-26 01:59:47 STFU....YOU created Parkland with your policy of not wanting schools & Police departments to report youth crimes/violence. YOUR admin legalized BUMP stocks, YOU and Holder are CRIMINAL GUN RUNNERS #FastNFurious
2975 2018-03-26 01:59:25 Google DIY or homemade bump stocks. One article said they also can be made from 3D printers. Someone can make one if they want it!
2976 2018-03-26 01:58:49 1) Universal background checks including closing loopholes
Many mass shooters pass despite-
VA Tech- admitted to hospital for being a danger
CO & AZ- judge declared mentally unstable
TX- discharged for domestic violence 
2) banning bump stocks
3) raise age limit on certain types

2982 2018-03-26 01:57:08 Banning Bump stocks is a lousy first step. Not even close. But hey, still glad u won.
2983 2018-03-26 01:56:37 Lol
2984 2018-03-26 01:56:36 Some big stocks were down over 10% from the close on Friday the 16th to last Fridays close the 23rd...5 trading days! Some of these include $GOOGL and $BABA...down 10% in 5 days!!
2985 2018-03-26 01:56:09 @marcorubio @BriaKelly Common ground? W/ the idiot NRA opposing banning bump stocks? Or raising the gun owner age to 21? An 18yo can't buy booze, but can buy a killing machine! Booze can kill him(her)self & a few others. But a gun can kill many more! Great leadership and logic!
2986 2018-03-26 01:55:42 Investing in Penny Stocks That Matter...
2987 2018-03-26 01:55:29 I think you're confused though. Bump stocks have not been banned. Trump has said he /will/ ban them, and a bill has been announced that bans them, but it hasn't been passed yet and it will be a minimum of 3 months from now before they can even vote on it. 

And yes, the +
2988 2018-03-26 01:55:11 Lol u were like “Why did u panic?? You had 2 stocks.”
2989 2018-03-26 01:55:04 how about this instead:
-full background checks
-have a pre-approved list of gun modifications - no bump stocks or grenade launchers or any of that on your rifle
-a restriction on what your first gun could be and you can only own that one gun for a year before buying another
2990 2018-03-26 01:54:40 Yet your defense of them is simply ludicrous.  I am bored, yes with defense of bumb stocks.  No one cares about them.  I AM excited about ARMING TEACHERS IN SCHOOLS which is the next great advance of the 2A, and eliminating Gun Free Zones.
2991 2018-03-26 01:54:34 Hokum. Yours is a party that would gamble that tax cuts would lead to increased investment when south of the border we have seen that companies for which tax cuts are granted merely buy back their stocks. It has been preached and has failed any number of times.
2992 2018-03-26 01:54:28 Does anyone know why Obama legalized Bump Stocks?
2993 2018-03-26 01:54:00 Stocks will be bearish throughout this week, bottoms this Thursday
2994 2018-03-26 01:53:59 The Good News?  sure, ok remember  1. we remain in a long term Secular Bull Market (take my word for it) and 2.  The supply of stocks is shrinking while the growth of worldwide excess Capital (cash) keeps growing. Add 1 and 2 together, see what you come up with.
2995 2018-03-26 01:53:59 In 1st year of Obama's admin, the stock market rose 31%. In #45s first year, it grew 18% & it ain't looking good for year 2. (Yes I have stocks.) Ask former Carrier, ToysRUs & Harley Davidson employees about . We now have the highest deficit in history at $31T. #45 is the problem
2996 2018-03-26 01:53:47 Probably brokerage stocks stand out after recent correction. These are better managed compared to others as ownership vests with private individuals & families, who have their own capital/market cap to worry about. However markets continue to be dicey & interest

and my blood pressure shot up & my sensitivity to salt increased tenfold
2998 2018-03-26 01:53:35 Dude it would really behoove you to read some literature from the other side. The March isn’t to completely ban guns. It’s to ban bump stocks, assault rifles, other mods, and to institute stricter background checks and make it harder to get a gun.
2999 2018-03-26 01:53:28 For the long side I would need to see the $SPY basing at its 200 day SMA and leading stocks starting to breakout with volume from tight bases.  On the short we would need a failed retest of FEB lows which would then be the start of a downtrend

3010 2018-03-26 01:45:21 I've looked into my crystal ball. Trump will wake in the morning (assuming his buzz doesn't keep him up all night) and proclaim his new Responsible Gun Ownership Act that outlaws AK47s and bump stocks.
3011 2018-03-26 01:44:29 There will be a ban on bump stocks.  Asking for more is impossible. Shouldn't be but is. It's a step in the right direction as long as it is enforced. They will see how the ban goes before they try a next phase.

3016 2018-03-26 01:42:42 It's a done deal and priced into the stocks. The amount of planning and preparation the provinces have done over the past year confirms this. $weed.ca $mj $cron
3017 2018-03-26 01:42:40 We are. In time. But for now, it’s time to ban these assault-style weapons with high capacity magazines and bump stocks. That would be an acceptable start. I think that’s reasonable, HBU?
3018 2018-03-26 01:42:08 This from woman who had to have a concealed weapon to fire people from DHEC? I expect more out of you Ms. Templeton if you want to earn my vote.  What about banning AR-15s & bump stocks? Closing loophole that allowed Charleston massacre? Requiring background checks at gun shows?

3023 2018-03-26 01:40:05 They've all been tied together by the gop. Remember, chips, Daca, bump stocks, Daca.. Every time they put a spending bill together they hijack, Daca, gun control, and chips will come round again as well, as part of their bill. They're breaking rule of law. So I'm doing same.
3024 2018-03-26 01:39:39 You know what is quite sad? When the chairman of Students for Trump, plagiarizes a @joerogan tweet as their own opinion. The sad part is not the plagiarism, it is the fact that the tweet is true, but it is not taken seriously. Instead bump-stocks is discussed.
3025 2018-03-26 01:39:21 Fine your 5 million @NRA members against 25+ million who want gun laws: assault weapons ban, no high capacity magazines, no bump stocks no silencers, no CCW reciprocity. Congress just woke up. Drain the swamp means stop taking @NRA blood money
3026 2018-03-26 01:38:55 No bump stocks were used at parkland. You want a consensus. We don’t want to die. The reality is that it is no longer your decision. I don’t know if you are up for re-election in 2018 but if you are you better work on your resume.
3027 2018-03-26 01:37:51 If you read what I posted above the requests from the kids are to ban bump stocks (done), universal background checks (including mental health info etc) & eliminate loopholes for no id sales.  That does 0 to your guns, they are safe
3028 2018-03-26 01:36:59 They aren’t asking for a ban except on bump stocks.  Come on @marcorubio you are a smart guy. Most people don’t want a ban on our 2nd amendment rights, just change for the better

3042 2018-03-26 01:26:32 If the assault style of guns, high capacity magazines, or bump stocks were not available period??!? How would it NOT prevent mass shootings?
3043 2018-03-26 01:26:22 One possible way to reach them is to emphasize de-escalation of violence in general. I'm for de-militarizing police. I'm for scaling back the war budget. U.S. culture is too violent. Also universal background checks, ban bump stocks, sensible gun legislation.
3044 2018-03-26 01:23:36 Agree on that. I’m a proponent of the ‘buy the stocks of products you use.’ I’m trying to read up more on real estate and potentially get my hand in that.
3045 2018-03-26 01:23:21 If they banned bump stocks or made all sales require background checks, it'd've gone a long way, but they refused to even discuss that.
3046 2018-03-26 01:22:24 Waiting for some relevant ones .... But you have not posted any that speak to gun control especially for current assault style (not bump stocks) as Germany has lots of guns but low gun crime.

3052 2018-03-26 01:20:20 You wrote: "Trump is the first to listen to kids and meet with them."

The bill to fix NICS was introduced in Nov. 2017. It's a baby step but definitely a positive one. Fingers crossed that Sessions' reclassification on bump stocks works.

You don't know my news sources
3053 2018-03-26 01:19:58 in case you missed on friday as stocks melted down, Canada’s Senate voted 44-29 to send bill C-45 (also known as

3054 2018-03-26 01:19:56 Just like when he boycotted and threatened companies that do business with the NRA. Remember when Fed Ex wouldn't take sides he told everyone to sell their stocks, hoping to tank the company? He's been getting away with way too much for WAY to long, IMHO!
3055 2018-03-26 01:19:26 Watch the price of gold, silver, and mining stocks maybe a good time to invest.
3056 2018-03-26 01:18:35 Yes let's use simple terms like assault style weapons, bump stocks, high capacity magazines. It's simple BAN them ALL. We don't need it all complicated with fire rates and automatic switches or even fire suppressor. Let's drop those terms and KEEP IT SIMPLE

3060 2018-03-26 01:17:24 Guns and phones/cars aren't the same. Yes, texting while driving should be (and is) illegal. But cars and phones both dramatically improve lives- so outlawing them would do more harm than good.

Bump stocks and semi-auto weapons on the other hand- aren't even useful for hunting.
3061 2018-03-26 01:17:06 By the way they aren't trying to ban all guns.
They are talking about assault style rifles and universal background checks.
Also accessories such as high capacity mags and bump stocks.
Age limit.

But I do notice a lot of people believe that they are trying to ban all guns.

3064 2018-03-26 01:15:36 Obama SIGNED THE LAW that PERMITS bump stocks. Think about THAT
3065 2018-03-26 01:15:34 Well, when they are recorded yesterday saying "we'll accept the inch, banning bump stocks, but then we're taking the mile" and while being backed by everytown/momsdemand, which are Bloomberg-backed, who is a known wannabe gun grabber, you do the math.
3066 2018-03-26 01:15:09 Thank you for standing up for all those children being murdered in their mother's wombs. Don't know what "bump stocks" have to do with it, But save our kids
3067 2018-03-26 01:15:05 Yeah that's why they are rich ppl and they have to change the whole thing to stocks and invest on other companies. Then the taxes are straight 35%. That is why we have so low wage gap between the riches and poorest
3068 2018-03-26 01:15:04 If that's what you see then there is no point in communicating with you. Big corporations in the US have used their extra money to buy up their stocks - they have not used it to reinvest.

3073 2018-03-26 01:09:54 Trump just tanked the stocks because investors know these tariffs will be self-harming, and the IMF has calculated that his tax bill will only have small, brief benefits for the TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS of debt. Stormy passed a polygraph. Trump paid her to stay quiet. You are BLIND.
3074 2018-03-26 01:09:34 That's why that teen said they were given an inch by banning bump stocks and they're going to take a mile? Yeah simple gun reform my ass.
3075 2018-03-26 01:09:15 ou have made implied claims about homeland security, it is up to you to back them up with research. 

And an ex soldier I can tell you that bump stocks are basically useless as a military item, in conflict most shots aren’t fired on automatic, and they make the rifle inaccurate.
3076 2018-03-26 01:08:36 What about bump stocks and the back ground checks??? Can you get this taken care of first??? Maybe some people would respect you!
3077 2018-03-26 01:07:53 At the Marching For Our Lives rally in Worcester yesterday I wanted to carry a a sign that said SAY NO TO BUMP STOCKS AND TRUMP'S COCK, but thought some might find it offensive.
3078 2018-03-26 01:07:25 Well we currently have 57k members. 20k didn’t believe the review and didn’t renew. I wouldn’t have if I wasn’t an AFL Gold Member X5. The idiots have fkd the club. We are laughing stocks. Dumb recruiting & trading.
3079 2018-03-26 01:05:01 Sir, can you make a video as to how to calculate the intrinsic value of stocks in simple language with sufficient examples...
3080 2018-03-26 01:04:56 Nobody cares get over it
3081 2018-03-26 01:04:37 I think you misread what he was stating.. he was saying that Trump was the first President to immediately follow up a tragedy with new regulations.. he banned Bump stocks and passed stricter background checks! Your news wouldn’t report that though.. doesn’t fit their narrative!
3082 2018-03-26 01:03:15 The Las Vegas shooter exposed that there is not the cut and dried difference between "semi-automatic" and "automatic" that we would like to believe. Bump stocks ruin accuracy, but that doesn't matter when you're firing into a crowd from 400 yards away.
3083 2018-03-26 01:02:56 Obama in 2010 made bumper stocks legal. Trump made them illegal. Obama did NOTHING to change gun laws after 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting. After Parkland school shooting, Trump made background checks tougher & gave CDC $ for gun violence study.  @KyleKashuv @JaclynCorin

3087 2018-03-26 00:59:50 Since 2000 dot com burst the big banks knew they would just get bailed out and they didn't answer to anyone. 2008 same thing... why deleverage properly when you can let it collapse. Now the petro yuan is official, how long before they collapse this bubble #stocks #nasdaq #future
3088 2018-03-26 00:59:38 How come you and @BarackObama legalized bump stocks. You guys are the biggest bunch of liars, cheats and thieves ever. People are so dumb they actually believe you soon. Oh, BTW, McCabe lawyer, trying to cut a deal.
3089 2018-03-26 00:58:35 and also, 'assault rifles' are already banned unless you have proper licensing and makeshift bump stocks can be easily made with a little bit of knowhow
3090 2018-03-26 00:58:27 Seems Trump's trade tariffs are simply a negotiating tactic. It may well come down to an old-fashioned game of chicken between America and China. And if you hold a considerable amount of stocks in your retirement portfolio, you are a player in the game.
3091 2018-03-26 00:57:50 inconvenience!!! its real money that people are loosing. Locked out of trades, no visibility of market and portfolio values reflected as $0. Not to mention the volume in volatile stocks gone due to your entire customer base not being able to participate. I hope you get fined!
3092 2018-03-26 00:56:19 Also banning bump-stocks :)
3093 2018-03-26 00:55:47 Investors’ sentiment on stocks may improve amidst more firms’ earnings announcements - Vanguard News -
3094 2018-03-26 00:55:04 That’s sad. Didn’t know it is so bad. So buying a condo is like buying stocks in a company. Do you know of buyers get access to review financials of the condo?
3095 2018-03-26 00:54:56 I never heard Obama mentioned raising gun purchasing age or ban bump stocks, never heard him holding series of listening & talking sessions  with victims' families, law enforcement agencies , Congress members in White House.
3096 2018-03-26 00:54:08 Getting for the first time. Health Insurance stocks, which have gone on.
3097 2018-03-26 00:53:19 There are a plethora of options. More robust background checks, psych evals, waiting periods, registrations, banning items like bump stocks...that's all the obvious, straightforward stuff, I'm sure there's plenty more. None of that would prevent responsible gun ownership.
3098 2018-03-26 00:52:57 But alcohol is regulated. Can't purchase till 21, and is illegal to consume alcohol at a certain level and drive. 

With guns, goal to regulate also, like Trump just banned bump-stocks, & armor-piercing bullets illegal. 

Woukd u have a problem to limiting magazines to 10 rounds?
3099 2018-03-26 00:52:53 Those of us who read and own stocks ourselves already knew this was going to happen smh

NYSE and Nasdaq Bullish Percent  remain +tive but some of the largest stocks are challenged creating more impact on the indices. Barometer is 60% hedged. Will update.
3102 2018-03-26 00:51:03 @Susan, se you are jumping to conclusions and not reading.  I am for banning AR15s, bump stocks, comprehensive background checks, etc etc etc. However, I am NOT for banning all guns and do not believe the MFOL kids are either.
3103 2018-03-26 00:49:39 Yung hindi pa dumadating mga stocks pero sold na agad.. NEED NA ulit magreorder 
3104 2018-03-26 00:48:40 #MarketAlert Dow Futures up 80 points, pointing to 158 pts gain at the open as stocks trying to rebound after heavy sell-off on Friday
3105 2018-03-26 00:48:09 Anybody that wants to ban bump stocks should shoot one first. Accuracy is literally non existent  liberals seriously hate facts
3106 2018-03-26 00:47:38 i will try everything!!!! if my bodega stocks these I WILL BE ON THEM
3107 2018-03-26 00:46:38 But the president signed a ban on bump stocks and other things that modify a weapon to be fully automatic.

3109 2018-03-26 00:46:00 Asia stocks begin the week mostly lower after hefty losses on Wall St last Friday, where trade concerns saw stocks post their worst weekly performance in 2 years.
3110 2018-03-26 00:45:37 Yes  WE SHOULD
3111 2018-03-26 00:45:36 why ??? it is this holier than thou attitude that makes us laughing stocks when our "heroes" fail to live up to expectations !!!!
3112 2018-03-26 00:45:24 The most-sponsored federal language on bump stocks is actually so expansive it could be argued to ban lubricating your gun.
3113 2018-03-26 00:44:19 You ain’t dropping their stocks boy
3114 2018-03-26 00:43:56 Uhm FBI had many complaints of Parkland shooter, yet failed to react.  Not arguing about bump stocks, but a shooter with a decent scope could have killed far more people, simply by aiming.  See Virgina Tech massacre, with handguns.
3115 2018-03-26 00:43:28 Jealous!  Could you scope out some $MGM and $MLCO properties while you're there?  I can not afford to spot check my stocks like that.
3116 2018-03-26 00:42:20 That's why background check expansion and the ability of the CDC to study gun violence were passed in the latest omnibus. And that the Trump administration moved to ban and confiscate bump stocks. 

Please, keep telling me there isn't a movement happening.
3117 2018-03-26 00:42:18 What about bump stocks
3118 2018-03-26 00:41:53 I guess you wanted Obama to keep bump stocks for guns! 
Sorry Trump fixed that.
3119 2018-03-26 00:41:36 @Snapchat y’all want your stocks to go back up... bring out the best friends feature.
3120 2018-03-26 00:41:17 It really doesn't matter. Completely unnecessary either way, especially when the fully auto conversion kits and bump stocks and so readily available and legally obtained.

Kind of a neat little loophole the NRA legislated for itself with it's paid off lobbyists huh?
3121 2018-03-26 00:41:12 Watch Facebook stocks plummet tomorrow!
Now it's at 159.39 
I have seen the writing on the Wall!
3122 2018-03-26 00:40:36 We want to avoid trouble whenever possible.Stocks appear to be crash mode we get intimidation (cold war resuming)which scares me.

3125 2018-03-26 00:39:30 Nobody needs an AR-15. Nobody needs bump stocks to shoot 500 bullets a minute. Nobody needs these things. But the NRA pushes it for money. After Newtown, background checks? They pushed against them.

You can believe in self-defense without that.
3126 2018-03-26 00:38:43 Assault rifles, automatic weapons, bump stocks. No gun owner should need those for protection or hunting
3127 2018-03-26 00:37:54 European stocks mostly fell for a third straight day on Friday, suffering their lowest close in more than a year as tensions between the US and China escalated.
3128 2018-03-26 00:37:21 Financial and technology stocks were among the hardest hit as Morgan Stanley dived 4.7%, Bank of America tumbled 4.5% and Citigroup sank 3.4%, while Facebook slid another 3.3%, Amazon dropped 3.2%, and Microsoft and Intel both shed 2.9%.
3129 2018-03-26 00:37:12 US stocks fell sharply on Friday, adding to their steep weekly losses, as investors assessed the possibility of a trade war brewing between the US and China.
3130 2018-03-26 00:37:08 Ban some bump stocks.  These kids will shut up!   #DisappointmentIn4Words
3131 2018-03-26 00:36:54 When you say mods what do you thinking of? I think of flash lights, laser pointers, bipods, different scopes, grips, triggers ect. Bump stocks are hokey and are not very accurate despite increasing rate of fire for newbies. When you say "ban" you show your hand. God Bless.
3132 2018-03-26 00:35:52 get the laws passed for gun reform. I believe in the 2nd amendment, bump stocks must be banned. no citizen should have an weapon used in wars unless it's time to go to war.
3133 2018-03-26 00:35:27 Take the military's budget for semiautomatic weapons and use it to fund a gun buyback. Regulating bump stocks and lower receivers is a fool's errand.
3134 2018-03-26 00:32:41 There is no Trump boom. There is a central bank fueled boom. If trump were not elected or if he is impeached / indicted the market will go higher as long as there is monetary and fiscal easing.  Every tax break makes it better to be a owner (stocks) than creditor (bonds)
3135 2018-03-26 00:32:37 stocks not shots
3136 2018-03-26 00:31:51 I have no problem with concealed carry. My problem is the NRA trying to bribe politicians so bump stocks, semiautomatic rifles, and high magazine guns keep getting sold. It only leads to bad things. I think most marching are in my mindset.
3137 2018-03-26 00:30:55 Any ban (incl stupid bump stocks) doesn't fix the problem. That's like banning cars (the gun) or banning gasoline (the ammo)! Even though guns, b stocks, knives, cars, psi cookers & many other objects have been used to kill people there's only one thing in common. Crazy People!!!
3138 2018-03-26 00:30:19 Do u object to Trump banning bump-stocks?
3139 2018-03-26 00:30:04 Ban assault weapons & bumb stocks.    Background checks on every buyer.  Register al guns just like we do cars, boats or other recreational vehicles     Increase funding for school counselors & counseling programs. Make mental health coverage mandatory
3140 2018-03-26 00:29:56 Switched it for ciroc to give puff’s stocks the boost
3141 2018-03-26 00:29:28 Please keep the GOP and Trump in power. My strategy of buying stocks in companies related to the most corrupt admin since Harding's and protecting my downside with puts when they inevitably screw the pooch is killing it! I will keep going to the well until it runs dry.
3142 2018-03-26 00:28:06 Even if you're high you should be able to avoid the hit you should be able to SDI properly, though i must admit Bayo can steal some stocks with early gimps

But it's pretty situationnal/avoidable imo
3143 2018-03-26 00:27:52 Nobody is saying "ban all guns". They're saying "limit sales of automatic rifles and bump stocks and make it tougher to get them."

You can believe in the right to own a pistol for self defense WITHOUT believing in the extremist views of the NRA.
3144 2018-03-26 00:26:43 According to Fox News, all these people were in line to buy bump stocks.
3145 2018-03-26 00:26:13 LAST WEEK: Trump Tariffs on about $60 billion of products from China helped erase some $1.8 trillion from the value of US equities. The worst week for stocks since January of 2016. That's not good.
3146 2018-03-26 00:26:11 Science fact fuck, its powerful fuck shit Gotta add that right Free orphan stocks are queens, kabuto! Don’t have your breath
3147 2018-03-26 00:26:03 I’m happy to be called an idiot if it means no assault weapons, accessories like bump stocks, and high-capacity magazines. And to preempt a charge of liberalism, I vote conservatively and come from a family of military and police service.) But thanks for the generalization.
3148 2018-03-26 00:25:51 Stocks in high horses surge as everyone has their say on #SandpaperGate

3150 2018-03-26 00:25:28 Liberals: WTF I LOVE BUMP STOCKS NOW
3151 2018-03-26 00:25:17 price is what you pay: value is what you get. whether we're talking about socks or stocks, i like buying quality merchandise when it is marked down.#UniChallengeRw
3152 2018-03-26 00:23:36 And you are right. Your imagined "God-given" right (however it is the constitutionally & Supreme Court backed right) to own a firearm isn't up for debate. What IS up for debate is banning NRA-driven, not #2a-supported assault weapons & bump stocks. #MarchForOurLives
3153 2018-03-26 00:23:33 To settle the #gundebate... there has to be COMMON SENSE gun laws. Not everyone has to be armed. And there is no need for assault rifles, or bump stocks.
3154 2018-03-26 00:22:32 Finally (cus I'm mentally drained hahaha) I would like to see stricter penalties on people who commit gun crimes or possess illegal firearms.  Like I said I agree with ban on only bump stocks and that's all the wording should say.  Semi auto rifles are a common rifle and have

3157 2018-03-26 00:21:29 You have a right to a pistol in your home (what the 2A advocates) You shouldn't have the right to a military assault rifle with bump stocks (what the NRA advocates). You fit in the first mindset, not the second.

Doing shit to create jobs.  Screw America again.........
3163 2018-03-26 00:18:05 According to Gallup, just over half of Americans own stocks at all. What’s more, the richest 10 percent of Americans own 80 percent of all stock shares. The bottom 80 percent of earners own just 8 percent. #TaxScam #TaxCutsForStockBuybacks

3166 2018-03-26 00:11:35 Next they will announce a $200 "buy back" program for every device capable of turning a semi-automatic weapon into an "assault weapon" like the bump stocks.  Then we can turn in rubber bands for $200 each.

3168 2018-03-26 00:09:15 Weak and does little to address how some weapons have no business being in hands of civilians. Ban bump stocks and similar items. Ban military style weapons. Universal background checks. Mandatory wait period. All firearms 21+. And that’s just a start.
3169 2018-03-26 00:08:45 It’s called gun reform. And gun control. Not gun ban!!!  We support the second amendment too. Just not having assault rifles. Bump stocks and ar 15s. We need sensible gun laws. And shame on you for being from Florida where latest mass shooting happened and trying to distort fact
3170 2018-03-26 00:08:40 You missed that speech about getting bump stocks is just a start. We can no longer compromise and retain our rights for long
3171 2018-03-26 00:07:54 Asia stocks begin the week mostly lower after hefty losses on Wall St last Friday, where trade war concerns saw stocks post their worst weekly performance in 2 years and the DJIA slipped into correction territory; ASX200 (-0.6%),  Nikkei225 (-1.0%), KOSPI (-0.4%)
3172 2018-03-26 00:07:28 I’m ok with the first one. But if you’re going to limit clip size, shouldn’t we limit number of clips? Removing bump stocks negates need to ban AR15, imo.
3173 2018-03-26 00:07:13 Bump stocks, if anything, waste ammunition and substantially reduce accuracy. They weren't a hill worth dying on in my opinion.
3174 2018-03-26 00:07:13 Invest in stocks.
3175 2018-03-26 00:07:05 Why didn't Obama ban assault rifles and bump stocks ?
3176 2018-03-26 00:06:30 Lol.  3 stocks will go up over the next 3 years no matter the tariffs Trump imposes - crazy pills, rubber, and glue.

3178 2018-03-26 00:05:39 sorry dabuz, i have great respect for you as a player but i cannot get behind that mindset at all. nearly all of top 8 was filled with explosive, fast paced sets, probably some of the fastest stocks we've seen taken even in a stacked tournament like this.
3179 2018-03-26 00:05:15 Can we expect a video on complete chart setup (recent strategic) for swing trade. It's been a long time you have shared your chart setup. We also would love to see some of your rejected stocks with reason respect to chart setup or any other. @nitinbhatia121 #NitinBhatia
3180 2018-03-26 00:05:11 Here’s three: outlaw bump stocks, no mag clips above 10 and ban AR 15.
3181 2018-03-26 00:04:24 It has to be an “Us vs. Them” mentality because the people in charge of this damn country aren’t making any changes, even though more people continue to die. Sure, Trump is getting bump-stocks banned, but that’s not going to be enough for this senseless violence to stop
3182 2018-03-26 00:03:58 Last one, gotta do stuff...Relax, take a deep breath ok?
Changing a law takes a lot more than that and can be appealed, drawn out etc.
Also, Trumps got plans. Friday, they just approved..no bump stocks. It'll all work out.
Do Pray.
3183 2018-03-26 00:03:24 People had great respect for the NUM but it was taken over by the hard-left.  With secondary picketing coal stocks were running low, so the govt had to reduce energy consumption through the 3-day week. The hard-left were interesting in control not in #TheMany.
3184 2018-03-26 00:03:17 Since Congress seems uninterested in finding common ground on most issues, this argument is an excuse for lack of action on this topic.  Republicans have had no problem voting thru whatever they want - so vote for change on autos, semi-autos and bump stocks!
3185 2018-03-26 00:02:23 People who think Bayo should be banned  hasn't played enough other fighting games, think Sonic is the reaseon we don't do 3 stocks , new to smash games or thinks anyone can pick up bayo and get good
3186 2018-03-26 00:01:59 I believe we don't need AR-15s, AK-47s & bump stocks, but universal background checks are offensive, a big step toward fascism, and have been PROVEN INEFFECTIVE. The 99% of us who are sane DO NOT have to prove it based on th 1% who are violent nuts.
3187 2018-03-26 00:01:45 I know when last weeks hot stocks are no longer trading at highs without checking charts.

Coz they are not tweeted about constantly this week. 

What does that tell you about when to sell?
3188 2018-03-26 00:01:28 $FB declined 14% last week #Stocks #trading #StockMarket #markets #WallStreet #thestreet #economics
3189 2018-03-26 00:01:21 You want gun reform... fine. I’m as pro gun as they come. Let’s fix the background check system, eliminate bump stocks, close the gun show loophole, make it harder for those with mental issues or criminals to get guns. I’m all for that (1/2)
3190 2018-03-26 00:00:49 But a gun restraining order could be brought around by family and such, faster and be able to deal with these people. Then we have a huge mental health problem which I will discuss in depth if you wanna, but basically that has to be dealt with. Then bump stocks should be banned.
3191 2018-03-26 00:00:03 Stocks are gonna be scary tomorrow
3192 2018-03-26 00:00:01 in fact, the nra is attempting to block any law prohibiting the sale and use of bump stocks
