11 2018-12-23 23:52:25 Funny you mention it because I have a notepad with a list of 10 stocks on which I plan to write (more) puts. Nothing aggressive, cash covered at levels I'd be bidding.
12 2018-12-23 23:52:04 Yeah James Mattis will never get it either, but we’re sure glad that _you_ are confident with this criminal who can’t be trusted to run a non-profit and has created the worst dec. for stocks since ‘31 and shut down the govt.
13 2018-12-23 23:50:45 Such as? I have MMKT and bond funds too, if that's what you mean, but I plan to shift much of that into stocks. I feel even more strongly this time than last Dec. and I got it right then (though the year was slightly down overall). I could be wrong, of course.

16 2018-12-23 23:48:12 This is ridiculous and not how the markets work at all. Nobody of consequence on Wall St. cares about Mnuchin. Plus volume on Xmas Eve will be very low. Market could go up or down but its not an indicator of much. Bank stocks are tanking and the Fed made it a lot worse last week.
17 2018-12-23 23:47:47 Part of me reads stories that seem to frame the current stock drop as a thing the Fed should respond to but isn’t it possible this is a necessary drop given everything that’s happening + how high stocks have gotten?

40 2018-12-23 23:45:08 let's do TARP II. Maybe treasury can buy US stocks next
41 2018-12-23 23:45:01 In the US, less than 4000 companies are actively traded in NYSE or Nasdaq. There are another 15000 stocks that are traded over the counter. Of those ~19000 90% are performing poorly. Does it remind you of something? $SPX #ff
42 2018-12-23 23:43:38 apple stocks rise by 69%.
43 2018-12-23 23:43:25 They make up money out of thin air then purchase debt or give it others to purchase stocks or bonds. 
Its not real, Its not based on anything.

the whole system is only based on confidence.

the more they print the less the dollar is worth, the more inflation you will get.
44 2018-12-23 23:42:31 Paulson, Geithner, Bernanke et al did this kind of thing when there really WAS a crisis and a risk of the financial system simply failing. We aren’t anywhere near anything remotely resembling that. Stocks have been falling. So what. That happens.
45 2018-12-23 23:42:23 di ko bet stocks ng food dito sa bahay huhu
46 2018-12-23 23:41:37 Yeah!!!! Next time let’s do stocks instead of time ckahchshxhz
47 2018-12-23 23:41:29 We aren’t in a recession. US Economy is doing fine but that’s not why stocks are down. Markets will lead the economy lower this Cycle.

49 2018-12-23 23:41:03 A blind squirrel finds a nut once in a while. Bills and Jets have been the leagues laughing stocks for a long time and the Dolphins suck. Name a division with 3 worse teams
50 2018-12-23 23:40:43 and, how was it a blunder? he basically said that the govt will be intervening come monday. same thing Obama said at the lows in 2009. he said “i think today is a great time to be buying stocks”
51 2018-12-23 23:40:12 What are you horrified with, your 401K stocks having the best returns in years or the great economy? Would really like to know! @Varneyco @cvpayne @LouDobbs @The_Trump_Train @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness
52 2018-12-23 23:39:04 Investors cry about interest rates on one hand and on the other accuse Trump of wanting to fire the guy. Can’t have it both ways. Wall Street is full of emotional cripples. Someone sneezes and they dump stocks.

54 2018-12-23 23:36:44 The only thing that could push stocks up is news and there ain’t no news coming to tomorrow except Santa’s reindeer LOL
55 2018-12-23 23:35:31 @DannyLeroux @NateDuncanNBA Hawks vs Pistons, quack quack oops, Langston Galloway should be sent to the stocks 
56 2018-12-23 23:33:30 Actually the stocks have already crashed. Bottomed out horribly in the past few weeks. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates again. Oh, and Trump owes several dozens of millions to failed businesses, lawsuits, and the State of New York.
57 2018-12-23 23:33:18 Yg still has stocks in naver that he uses for mediaplay. And you cannot tell me that a group that literally debuts with a PAK is not privileged.
58 2018-12-23 23:32:06 Caveat! These guys may be playing their part as clueless goof offs while friends and  associates may be shorting stocks,  bonds and index contracts.
59 2018-12-23 23:31:13 stocks opened lower, and each time aggressive buying buoyed the markets. Heller suggested that the Federal Reserve purchased stock index futures contracts to stop a market collapse. He also believes that because the Fed already rigs the bond market through securities purchases,
60 2018-12-23 23:30:59 Me: Wants 1 vs 1, 3 stocks, 7 minutes no items,

Nintendo: we’ll put you in a 1 vs 1, 2 stocks, 3 minutes, items on, stage hazards on.
61 2018-12-23 23:30:20 No use talking to bankers. Stocks will bottom only if they see USG dysfunction ends with ending shutdown, ending trade wars so on. Dysfunction likely to continue as long as Trump tainted with crimes incl hush money payments to his sex partners. Expect continued bear market.
62 2018-12-23 23:29:37 Translation buy stocks, HFT sell bomb oil & gold cause we don't have any actual answers.
63 2018-12-23 23:29:12 Note the first sentence of the article. Even the author and the Democrats in the House don’t think it will pass.

What’s your take on the bump stock ban? Shouldn’t the President have gone through Congress to ban bump stocks?
64 2018-12-23 23:28:48 red wine > stocks
65 2018-12-23 23:28:01 E Deus disse a Moisés: “Moisés as armas são um direito do povo escolhido! Mas nada de armas automáticas, carregadores de alta capacidade, suprimidas ou bump stocks! De resto do 6.35 ao .50 é tudo para ter!”
66 2018-12-23 23:27:45 The moral calculus of many libertarians this week (potential genocide good, banning bump-stocks bad) is jarring.

Maybe if they call us neocons and promoters of "endless war" a few thousand more times, we'll better understand the error of our warmongering ways.
67 2018-12-23 23:27:30 Yeah, why such poor performance? I shouldn’t have to 5 years for my stocks to double. #TrumpForTheReserve 
68 2018-12-23 23:27:26 options like stocks
69 2018-12-23 23:26:56 Made $8K in stocks since the 2nd quarter & Friday I diversified my portfolio.  not a lot since I’m playing it safe & investing long term.
70 2018-12-23 23:26:17 Idk about nerfs for certain combos yet but I'm just glad we have 3 stocks this time around to adapt and figure it counter play.

72 2018-12-23 23:25:29 I know the facts. Obviously you don't. Trump is doing the right thing on trade & most common sense people agree w/ him. China has gotten away w/ ripping us off long enough. China is the worst on environment..look it up. Good grief. Do some research. Stocks will be fine.
73 2018-12-23 23:20:59 Germany used twin factory ships that used a weighted drag net that scaped across seabed, causing serious damage to breeding grounds. UK skippers complained that it was causing a serious decline in fish stocks but were ignored, it's only now that drag nets have been outlawed
74 2018-12-23 23:19:43 Word of advice to those who bash stocks.  You attract negative and I will block you.    There is a difference between asking and just bashing.  I know I am at fault with some stocks in being upset.
75 2018-12-23 23:18:43 Investors driving leaving stocks are buying and driving down yields
76 2018-12-23 23:17:06 My favorite moment in smash is when it's down to you and one other person and you have 2 stocks and they have 1. They already have high damage but they try nd attack you so you dodge, over and over. As the minutes go by, you remain unhit. Until they yield they walk off the edge
77 2018-12-23 23:16:42 That’s very observant  speaking of laughing stocks, how is being a Tennessee fan treatin ya? That bad huh?
78 2018-12-23 23:16:40 Any advice for those of us with 401ks?  Is there a safer place to temporarily move my money than stocks?

80 2018-12-23 23:15:55 Nice gesture @MattsCravat what’s the title?... and who stocks it in the Uk?
81 2018-12-23 23:15:14 I literally think that Trump ordered him to make this call and send this tweet because he’s tired of “the stocks going down” and he was running out of investment bank CEOs to yell at.
82 2018-12-23 23:14:51 When Buffett and Munger bought stocks in 2009 they used a range of factors and applied them using microeconomics based on an analysis of individual stocks and the margin of safety concept. The core with both approaches is identifying the mistakes of other investors.
83 2018-12-23 23:14:40 Back from the supermarket, plenty folk in there trying to avoid the parsnip wars tomorrow. Don’t worry if you’ve still to go though, the Advocaat stocks are looking healthy.
84 2018-12-23 23:14:28 Aussie shares start a holiday shortened session & week in the red with the #ASX 200 -55pts or 1% after US stocks retreat. All sectors are in negative territory #ausbiz
85 2018-12-23 23:12:20 You vs me. Melee: I get 2 stocks, you get 4; SU:  I get 3 stocks, you get 1.
86 2018-12-23 23:10:06 It's easy to dismiss, some of the better Twitter handles. Why? Because they don't have a large number of followers. The one's with the most followers are not necessarily the best to follow. #trading #investing #stocks
87 2018-12-23 23:09:37 Were people asking him to step in based off of Stock Market performance alone? I truly enjoyed losing near 45% of the value of certain stocks since July, and I'm a bit concerned a housing bubble pop is incoming, again. Anyway, I'm going to buy some books and scotch for now.
88 2018-12-23 23:09:29 La totalité de l'uranium naturel de nos centrales étant importée, la France est également ultra-dépendante d'autres pays. D'ailleurs, combien de stocks avons-nous d'avance ?
89 2018-12-23 23:09:08 We're all exhausted. Opening week was crazy yet we surpassed that by a massive amount. Thank you everyone and merry Christmas to all of you. Stocks are running low but we will have enough to go again tomorrow but forgive us if we look a bit worn out. Good night folks.
90 2018-12-23 23:08:42 If anyone buys or sell stocks based on this,they shouldn’t be in the market
91 2018-12-23 23:08:00 Yeah, so much for that thought I had about getting back into the market tomorrow. Though I hear that bank stocks could be pretty cheap by the end of the day.
92 2018-12-23 23:07:40 Our local countdown stocks them, varies from store to store but NW Thorndon usually have a great selection. It’s awesome!
93 2018-12-23 23:04:53 News in the stock market- it’s official!  This is the worst YEAR for stocks since the great recession & the worst MONTH for stocks since the great depression in 1932.
94 2018-12-23 23:04:43 Probably worth taking a shot here buying stocks. Could get stopped quickly but could also hit a runner.
95 2018-12-23 23:03:18 I was going to say the same thing,  Chad in street stocks!
We were there, pretty sure I had a CRA pink tshirt

107 2018-12-23 22:55:16 Healthy markets dont have 6 stocks representing 70% of major holdings across hedge funds. Big theme going forward is rotation into the ignored names and our of bubble tech (I think)
108 2018-12-23 22:54:40 the stocks are good guys! don’t look at them! markets fine. no you don’t need to check. everything’s cool. just don’t look at it!!!
109 2018-12-23 22:54:11 IF the last few weeks have taught me anything, its just how right on the money were all those trading tips or guides, telling you your number one priority as a trader is to protect your capital.  BTC, penny stocks, blue chips, commodities, its been a wild ride for all

112 2018-12-23 22:51:59 This is the GOP’s fault.  It controls both chambers.  It controls the WH.  Time for the GOP to reign in its leader?  And how have stocks done this week?
113 2018-12-23 22:51:58 /4, owns OCN stocks and sits on the board still I think.  Why didn’t he have to disclose that before his Sec. of Commerce confirmation?  Ross was VP at Bank of Cyprus.  Where’s that investigation going?  Did he get commission from the sale of the Trump FL mansion to the RU richy?
114 2018-12-23 22:50:44 Hopefully locked in stocks in parliament square for all to do as they wish

118 2018-12-23 22:49:45 I also rebelled and opened the Pringles this evening.... will need to go out and replenish the stocks tomorrow
119 2018-12-23 22:48:13 wouldn't a huge windfall buyback increase the value of the stocks and make the market cap higher which would directly make the dow higher if just because someone threw money at it...and isn't that the number many americans equate with economic prosperity? it was a clever move :-(

122 2018-12-23 22:47:44 Harvard would have been stupid to pass on David. A high school senior who can organize, influence and change American society ( see bum stocks) is worth more than a 1400 score. There are plenty of those around. #fuckyouNRA
123 2018-12-23 22:47:35 First time experiment with QE and an unwind. I would be foolish if I thought I knew an exact answer.  I view QE as an asset price tool, and regular rates as effecting the econ. Of course stocks fall, ceo's get tight as can consumers. I just worry if former peak is the new base.
124 2018-12-23 22:46:19 After the 1987 crash, in which stocks fell 23% in a single day, Alan Greenspan issued a one-sentence statement saying that the Fed stood ready to provide liquidity as needed.
125 2018-12-23 22:45:48 A Treasury Secretary should NEVER put out a statement that banks have ample liquidity unless there are unfounded fears that they don't! Banks are much better capitalized and have more liquiidity than in 2008. A bear market in stocks doesn't cause a banking crisis.
126 2018-12-23 22:45:21 @realDonaldTrump doesn't read & he doesn't listen to his staff! Unless Rush or someone on Fox tells him he has billions to spend on the wall he will stay in the dark. Same guy wants to fire Powell for quantitive tightening! Screw tools for when the stocks "really" sink from debt!
127 2018-12-23 22:43:36 Do those nerf guns come with bump stocks?
128 2018-12-23 22:42:47 The more you loom into EA from here going backwards rhe more they deserve this "Quiet Riot" of their stocks falling hard.
129 2018-12-23 22:42:45 I wasn’t trading in 2008 but from what I learned, only cash is king, buy strong stocks adding on the way down, then wait 7 years and retire rich.
130 2018-12-23 22:41:59 Dang, do people who play with 2 stocks miss Sm4sh that much?
131 2018-12-23 22:40:55 Or bayo just always loses two stocks every time as a nerf

133 2018-12-23 22:40:12 Doing terrific, thanks for asking. Lower taxes. Higher pay, steady health care (keeping my own DR now.) Stocks will bounce back, but that's not affecting my day to day.
134 2018-12-23 22:39:57 Wait, what?  Mnuchin has been on the phone with bankers to reassure investors about the stock market?!?  Isn’t that like insider trading or something?  So, Steven, what stocks should I buy on Monday morning, huh?  Can’t hear you...

136 2018-12-23 22:39:12 I wouldn’t be surprised if big banks are behind the #StockMarket drop by dumping stocks to make President Trump look bad.
137 2018-12-23 22:38:47 They cried about bump stocks for weeks.  Trump bans bump stocks in the Criminal Justice reform bill....crickets.  These people have no intellectual integrity
138 2018-12-23 22:36:43 $SPX Anecdote: Was in Costco on Friday...checking quotes on my phone...old man asked me if I did stocks...was asking me for advice...also when I said I covered most of my puts I got some push back on Titter. Do what you want with that info...

141 2018-12-23 22:35:31 You are coming around, now you are realizing bump stocks are not even needed. 

I think with the proper technique you can get the reaction you desire without a bump stock or a rubber band.

If you are strong enough to handle and utilize the recoil.

143 2018-12-23 22:33:19 And most people didn't know which stocks they were picking 
144 2018-12-23 22:33:11 If you only consider the yield, yes. But in terms of total return, you should add some earnings growth. At least inflation, but rather somewhat more. I think 3% is realistic long term. So the long term total return expectation for stocks is 10% and circa 3% for 10y bonds.

147 2018-12-23 22:32:31 I fully expect a #Trump tweet on stocks making a recovery at all tops of the bear market rallies going forward
148 2018-12-23 22:31:18 Watch bank stocks plummet tomorrow lol
149 2018-12-23 22:30:40 Convo went something like this.              Q “Why are stocks going down so much is there anything you can do?”      A “ We aren’t really sure, could have something to do with your boss being a raving buffoon trying to lead the country into the ground.”

151 2018-12-23 22:30:04 At what point do we pull a Japan and have the FED buy stocks directly? So bad.
152 2018-12-23 22:29:12 Well thanks for educating me @Bushi357, I am now 100% pro-bump stocks. Definitely a productive conversation for my sake! Merry Christmas to all! 
153 2018-12-23 22:28:55 @TheBearSlayer I think what going to happen is after this thing then happen we will have s pop on all these stocks because they oversold
154 2018-12-23 22:28:19 Invest in some stocks
155 2018-12-23 22:28:07 Or wait for the next crash to buy up stocks? :^)
156 2018-12-23 22:27:37 I have been following you for a bit and like the analytics of the otc stocks you write about. I am looking into NOUV and have not seen you write anything about it. Is this a stock you like? Please lmk thanks.

162 2018-12-23 22:24:08 Our company got a investment program called CURACAO KAHLUA.
It is based on a regulatory tax facilitation, where you get in return a % of the margin in the stocks growth as a win win sustainability profit on wall street of our portfolio.
163 2018-12-23 22:23:26 Buyer beware: stocks aren't done dropping! I would hold off and look for a bottom. Also, holding a few ETFs would be safer than individual stocks.

165 2018-12-23 22:21:26 I'd love to get into a slap fight with a Q-ball, but I frankly have better things to do with my time. All of those stocks will correct, not because they are part of some lizard people conspiracy, but simply because they are overbought.
166 2018-12-23 22:21:10 Senator DURBIN being of the [party that historically Loathes the Military and uses them like pawns at there every chance,Should stop acting as protector of the Nations Protectors it is so hollow! Maybe like a lot of other  Phonies you have stocks in war material Companies?
167 2018-12-23 22:19:17 Proof that the West Side #vanre crash is starting to take hold... more and more trolls are baiting me and telling me that my data is false, cherry picked, and that I don't point out all the successful transactions (find me one). Too funny. Stocks down. R/E down = panic.

170 2018-12-23 22:18:39 ...some stocks in his portfolio were taking a hit due to Trump's crazy rants so he's trying to give them a boost?

172 2018-12-23 22:16:12 I know too much about how “reports” work to care, honestly.

My investing philosophy is very simple. Do research, get my own stocks, leave them there for like ten years or longer.

175 2018-12-23 22:14:49 The decisions we made were and still are good decisions. Stocks go up and done. It’s always been that way. It’s just right now we don’t have the time for them to recover. The crisis is not stocks - it’s how we don’t have affordable healthcare for elderly in America.
176 2018-12-23 22:14:18 You mean U applaud President Trump for pressuring the DOJ to ban bump stocks, you are such an ingrate. Trump could give every citizens 5 million $ and you'd find a way to criticize him .. U have serious TDS .. build the wall. I'm a constituent of yours, build the wall now.
177 2018-12-23 22:14:18 Traders in USA are hell bent on USA losing China trade war. Buy chinese stocks
178 2018-12-23 22:13:25 Those places are basically gun free. So that’s what you want? Well quit pretending it’s about bump stocks and “assault weapons”. You want to ban all guns
179 2018-12-23 22:12:57 Is it really liquidity issue or people just don’t want to buy overpriced stocks?
180 2018-12-23 22:12:31 I’m confused.  In mid-Oct. Mnuchin said the drop in stocks was a “natural correction.”  Today, on a Sunday, he held calls with the CEO’s of the six biggest banks to ask about their businesses.   Does Mr. Mnuchin still think this is simple correction or is he worried about more?
181 2018-12-23 22:12:21 Because the majority of Americans are heavily exposed to 10-12 over priced, over hyped and breaking parabola chart pattern tech stocks with suspect earnings in their 401ks.
182 2018-12-23 22:12:17 You haven't really lost any money unless you sold. You still own the stocks you bought and we will recover.

187 2018-12-23 22:09:14 Some great charts here. Doesn't this one have financial variables (stocks and yield curve slope) already in it? Still, claims (which lead recession just less than a year) do point in a similar direction?
188 2018-12-23 22:09:07 Hahaha I would never do such an extreme thing. I made my first investment on stocks lol.
189 2018-12-23 22:08:36 me too...stocks like G (gillette) were ticking down in integers...guys at my firms OTC desk were told not to pick up the phone because they'd have to be good for 1000
190 2018-12-23 22:08:29 Reminds me of what happened during the 1929 crash when the big bankers stepped in and bought a bunch of stocks to try to support the market

197 2018-12-23 22:03:40 I don't like "dead money", so I always believe in a proactive approach. If I cannot count on my stocks maintaining value, then I short them. I'm not a fan of shorting, but this is my livelihood, so I do what I must to insure a constant stream of revenue.
198 2018-12-23 22:01:53 Why doesn't the Fed just quit fooling around with a middle-man and directly monetize stocks, like the SNB does?  The Dow could hit 25 million or something. Think of the wealth effect.

200 2018-12-23 22:00:39 Summary: "Please don't sell your stocks"
201 2018-12-23 21:59:21 If you want to blame someone, look no further than all the major central banks. They inflated the bubbles in stocks, bonds, housing etc. People soon retiring may soon find out that their savings have disappeared.
202 2018-12-23 21:59:08 Stocks are still high.
203 2018-12-23 21:58:47 Mark Minervini's 50/80 rule seems to be especially relevant at this choppy time, particularly for the so-called FANG stocks. "Once a secular market leader puts in a major top, there is a 50% chance that it will decline by 80% and an 80% chance that it will decline by 50%."
204 2018-12-23 21:58:08 Mandatory divestment of Private business assets.  Mandatory 3rd party management of stocks and bonds.

211 2018-12-23 21:54:32 I'm not a lawyer either, but how is the BATFE's actions regarding bump stocks not entrapment? First saying it's OK, then changing their mind to retroactively affect purchases?
212 2018-12-23 21:53:02 Why shouldn't he? The only thing you people and MSM can say is the bad. Where is the praise for him banning bump stocks, something the obama era made legal. It was something good so there is silence.
213 2018-12-23 21:52:27 And that's what Republicans are saying about the #TrumpShutdown

229 2018-12-23 21:34:14 that's a "non sequitur". Central banks push stocks, people get overexposed, institutions (thanks, #VAR !) underestimate risks and get overexposed, until either the CB takes away the punch bowl (and only the #FED can) or S*** happens. @dlacalle_IA
230 2018-12-23 21:32:58 @badams - As far as high quality, undervalued stocks are concerned, I have not been wrong yet. However, it could happen someday.

237 2018-12-23 21:28:24 Could say the same about sandy hook, Newtown. Of course the feds raising interest rates had nothing to do with stocks. Guess it was OK for the last admin. to add 9 trillion & change to the deficit. This from someone who has Ocasio2018 as a #? I know high schoolers who know more.

240 2018-12-23 21:27:04 Trump doesn’t want to face those executives whose corporate stocks he is decimating.  He may or may not be in the market, but they definitely are and this time he can’t brag about how much money he is making them.  Being yelled at makes his tummy sad.
241 2018-12-23 21:26:12 Lol what are you doing on twitter, don't you have a pizzeria to shoot up or something?
242 2018-12-23 21:26:05 Yea, abandon our allies to fight on their own, create a vacuum for ISIS to return and by all means give $12b in tax money to farmers to supplement the loss due to tariffs & please give tax cuts to corporations so they can buyback stocks.  It’s all worked out so well. 
243 2018-12-23 21:25:32 I'm not much of a tech investor, but Google, Apple, Nvidia, and Amazon are all looking pretty attractive at these levels. Apple and Nvidia have pretty conservative P / E ratios, at about 12 and 17, respectively.

Glad to see it's not just the pot stocks getting hammered.

253 2018-12-23 21:16:12 Of course, so businesses such as Siemen moving abroad, stocks beginning to tank, deregulation of banks, auto trade slumping, tax cuts for the super rich, and closing down the government was..... Obama's fault?
254 2018-12-23 21:13:42 apple stocks rise by 30%.
255 2018-12-23 21:12:50 As I Read All These Hateful Comments About @POTUS , It’s Obvious How Ignorant These Americans ( I Hope) Really Are.
Have You All Been Following The MASS Selloff Of Google Stocks, By Google Executives?
Can You Say”Insider Trading”&”Corruption”?
I Guess you still Follow #FakeNews?
256 2018-12-23 21:12:33 Ah bah du coup, vu que c'est du Blade, faut tout migrer sur du HP pour mieux gérer les stocks et pièces de rechange. 
257 2018-12-23 21:11:42 We have a local candy shop that stocks all the US sweets, my kids love it...came home with lots of Twizzlers!
258 2018-12-23 21:11:32 @UnofficialCBN  beneficiaries account the money is meant for my stocks feeds I have since then lost 500 stocks because there is no money to buy their feeds I am begging Nigerians to please help me beg Polaris to release my money I am a construction worker trying to invest
259 2018-12-23 21:11:22 @realDonaldTrump DT conveniently wants and takes credit when stocks are high. But economy is weak and stocks tumble it's everyone else's fault. Such a disgrace of a president.
260 2018-12-23 21:10:47 Trump lost a real chance for bipartisan compromise here. It was both a mistake & miscalculation. OTOH, I was glad to see that bump stocks were banned this week - by the administration, not Congress. It’s a small, essential, & insufficient step forward.
261 2018-12-23 21:08:59 Buying (Or Writing) When Stocks Are Down Big...

Measure twice, cut once.
262 2018-12-23 21:08:33 @NRA very disappointed by your stance on bump stocks.  I am more and more finding myself supporting the GOA.  Longtime NRA member!
263 2018-12-23 21:07:17 Let’s all sell stocks tomorrow!? #trump #TrumpResigns #TrumpChristmasShutdown
264 2018-12-23 21:07:04 Put you with my connect if ya stocks right
265 2018-12-23 21:06:08 Are you investing in any mining stocks?
266 2018-12-23 21:03:53 As in, if you think you are supposed to like something then you are more likely to like something. Same applies to art, film, fashion, stocks etc.
267 2018-12-23 21:03:51 It’s clear for straight thinking humans. Stocks and bonds. Keep up the good work, David!
268 2018-12-23 21:03:47 One of the biggest scams Americans have been fed is that people who use welfare are the biggest threat to your paycheck, when it’s really corporations who get welfare, turn around and use their tax cuts to buy back stocks, only to refuse to raise the wages of their workers.
269 2018-12-23 21:03:07 Banned bump stocks in an attempt to divert attention from the Mueller investigation.

271 2018-12-23 21:01:07 Yep that’s definitely possible. Pension rebalance numbers (into stocks) are big, low volume will exacerbate any move
272 2018-12-23 21:00:16 Why are there so many people playing 2 stocks with normal stages with 3 mins wtf
273 2018-12-23 20:59:33 Hahaha! At church they put you in front of the congregation in those things like old fashioned stocks.
274 2018-12-23 20:58:53 But I, and millions of other investors, invest in emerging market stocks, mutual funds and indexes. Ultimately, we only care about our $ returns, not our local currency returns.
275 2018-12-23 20:58:09 I'm probably the only one who is happy the market is RED before christmas ... means value is on sale! Buying quality low valuations companies ,now is the time to make a lot of money!

276 2018-12-23 20:55:27 In Nigeria banks actually dont fund young people. I went to several banks but got no deal response. they will deal for 35% or more if i am into trading and I have the stocks in a shop . for startups or other creative stuffs, no deal. I got from ren for about 9.8% per month.
277 2018-12-23 20:55:16 It's only speculation but wouldn't tomorrow & possibly this week be a good time for a low volume rally relevantly higher to set up typical rebalance & capital flows into the equity markets after the new year holiday concludes to pay higher prices for stocks?   Just a thought.
278 2018-12-23 20:54:59 Bump stocks are a nothing. Anyone with practice can do the same thing. It's the guy with it we should ban.

280 2018-12-23 20:51:48 accident has to be part of your investment thesis.  In '07 to '11 I owned UEC and DNN and USEG.  I walked in the house and saw the Fukushima Hydrogen explosion and at that minute I got on Scott trade and sold ever Nuke position.  Oddly, that Friday some stocks were up and did not
281 2018-12-23 20:51:32 honey yes and slay all their stocks with it as well 
282 2018-12-23 20:49:35 Yup, we don't know what we'll get, we only know what we got. I'll still put my money on a Balanced Growth model delivering the best results for a retiree. I think that will repeat, but no one knows the future. Greatest growth likely to come from companies/stocks, again.
283 2018-12-23 20:47:49 What a crock of sh*t.  There are no crises.  The economy (& stocks) are fine, @POTUS is getting us out of useless wars, the government shutdown is just a temporary annoyance caused by the Dems' hatred for @POTUS, making them vote against a badly needed wall.
284 2018-12-23 20:47:36 Christmas w/ my family:

285 2018-12-23 20:47:34 Top story is so sad Trump is r president so sad stocks r so sad the world is so sad I'm so sad u feel me
286 2018-12-23 20:47:16 Variety specials starting today until Thursday 27/12/18 or while stocks last!!
287 2018-12-23 20:45:42 Just a bummer because I'm on the 2050 plan and am currently playing with riskier stocks versus later down the line when it's safer. 

Wrong place wrong time.
288 2018-12-23 20:45:25 Safety of buffer stocks assumes that distribution - Rx, EPS, pharmacy supplies. ordering, transport - won't be affected.
We've been told things will be "prioritised": not clear how,criteria & by whom (but @theresa_may should be OK)
@rcgp @phcsg seriously
289 2018-12-23 20:44:41 I'm surprised by 2 of these:  --Slight PROFIT in #FANG #stocks & --LOSS in #legalpot !!  #FINANCEofTheDay :  #finance #investing #investments #investors #money #economy #markets #USA #EU #UK
290 2018-12-23 20:43:36 apple stocks rise by 10%.
291 2018-12-23 20:43:24 Between it's flop with bfa, and the announcement of Diablo for phones. It adds a certain level of precedent of why the stocks are falling
292 2018-12-23 20:42:44 NO one is taking advantage of the US except you and your cronies- you are causing a recession- stocks are plummeting - people being laid off and now you've shut down the government- you must be working for Russia because you are doing your best to destroy America and it's people
293 2018-12-23 20:41:20 Only if you get a loan to buy stocks.
294 2018-12-23 20:41:12 You wouldn’t need to do the farm bill if it wasn’t your uninformed view of tariffs and your inability to negotiate.  The criminal justice bill was republicans and democrats working together for years.  Not you.  Although you did ban bump stocks, way too late!
295 2018-12-23 20:40:44 For sure. I do believe it has potential if it stocks issuing stock and continue to grow at this insane rate.  But it is not impossible
296 2018-12-23 20:38:45 @Dennyboy1 yes agree for indices and stocks as well
297 2018-12-23 20:38:37 Je viens de gagner mon 1er 1vs1 3 stocks en ligne. Je pourrais me retirer là maintenant tout de suite tellement je suis fier de moi #SmashBrosUltimate
298 2018-12-23 20:38:32 Enter in bigger time frame. Liquidity problem would be there in stocks. Nifty would be fine. I haven't personally seen vix over 30. So far not giving much attention to vega. Let's see what market teaches us in future.
299 2018-12-23 20:37:10 Just a few places where our taxes were spent. For corporations to buy back stocks and layoff workers. The rich and government elect who put money in secret offshore accounts. Aiding farmers who got fucked by trumps tariffs..
Merry Christmas,Timmy and god bless us all

301 2018-12-23 20:35:42 Who the FUCK plays 3 minutes 3 stocks
302 2018-12-23 20:35:35 I don't know much about this, but understand there will be buffer stocks of insulin to cover 3-4 mths. Problem is maintaining that buffer if there are barriers to transport from EU. If GPs stockpile too that will be extra storage capacity (good) but shelf life is still a problem.
303 2018-12-23 20:33:29 Demographics is not on our side either as @RaoulGMI has pointed out a lot. Look at T Rowe price, vanguard, fidelity and American funds top holdings in their equity funds. Then pull up monthly charts of the stocks. Good grief this will be ugly
304 2018-12-23 20:32:54 Very true.  You just have to make some calculations and be comfortable for the premium you pay on some of these growth stocks.
305 2018-12-23 20:32:42 Lastly vega, say one day iv would be increased from previous day that day it ll give u loss other day it may come down from previous day and tat day it will give u profit and in general it's mean reversion. That's why we love to trade high Ivr,ivp stocks. 3/n

307 2018-12-23 20:30:36 When you say you lost everything and now you can’t retire, people will assume you’re talking stocks given the current investment environment.  If you lost your business, then I truly feel terrible for you.
308 2018-12-23 20:29:33 Don’t sell stocks in your IRA. Ride it out 2 years from now you won’t even remember it. This is just a standard correction
309 2018-12-23 20:28:56 And he banned bump stocks on guns which is a big one for me but this stupid wall idea I can’t get past and how he promised Mexico was going to pay for it. He miscalculated that Mexico and a lot of us are not that stupid to fall for what he was spewing

312 2018-12-23 20:28:22 speaking of 3 stocks i fought this ryu the other day on quickplay and i 3 stocked him lol he was so bad
313 2018-12-23 20:24:44 Cycles, charts, technical indicators and psychology. Multiple levels tagged and fundamentals on stocks at this point looking better.
314 2018-12-23 20:24:36 You don't remember W/Cheney great recession? You don't see deficit exploding by trillions? Don't see the market already down 1500+ since it was implemented? Companies just buy back their own stocks it's unsustainable- only a matter of time till next recession
315 2018-12-23 20:21:51 Wow what happened to the economy you were so good making America great again Adele has been down for a couple of days you need to get off of Twitter and get busy keep them stocks back up you're so good at it
316 2018-12-23 20:21:34 How about taking credit for stocks tanking?......,How about taking credit when you said you’ll be proud to shut it down, instead of now blaming it to Democrats?
317 2018-12-23 20:21:20 who tf plays 3 minute matches you brainlet its 4 stocks 8 minutes :angry: :angry: :angry:
318 2018-12-23 20:20:34 I note with interest that when not asking health service providers to lie about stocks of medicines in the event of a nodeal Brexit, HMG are advocating recourse to complementary treatments. Pity there ain’t none for those of us with no thyroid function #bitofaworry
319 2018-12-23 20:19:17 Corker is a snake. I wonder if he’ll make as much money off of stocks after he’s out of office? I’m sure Obama gave him a “pass” on his stock deals after Corker supportered Obama with open arms.
320 2018-12-23 20:18:39 They outlawed bump stocks.
321 2018-12-23 20:17:03 Bankers don’t control stocks, for those are in the hands of stock-holders who buy and sell them based on fluctuating stock prices. What banks do control are bonds, namely loans given by banks to those in need Yet bank has to be solid, not indebted itself, to lend successfully.
322 2018-12-23 20:16:45 I had some till the coons broke into the coop and committed genocide. There has been an on going war with those vermin ever since then. No prisoners taken.  I may get a half dozen this spring when Tractor Supply stocks them. Pullets only, no roosters.
323 2018-12-23 20:15:51 Remember how Candidate Trump was promoted as this great negotiator/businessman who would bring such great managerial skill to the Presidency? So how’s that working out Bucky?
Government shutdown
Stocks sharply down 
Cabinet in shambles

325 2018-12-23 20:15:29 America is definitely less secure.  Pittsburgh, Charlottesville, Las Vegas, and many more. The economy has improved, but stocks are having their worst year since 2008. Huge budget deficits of $1T coming. The arrogance is all yours. Turn off #fauxnews. @Ocasio2018
326 2018-12-23 20:14:11 I'm legitimately the worst person in the world when I play #AnimalCrossing characters in #SmashBrosUltimate. I have this bizarre problem where I can't take anything seriously with those characters. I could be 3 stocks up on someone at 0% and still lose cause #shenanigans.
327 2018-12-23 20:14:00 Stocks are in a slump right now because of the rate hike. Democrats are the reason for the shutdown bc of the funding for the Borderwall. How is he hypocritical? Hes done everything he said he would do when he ran?
328 2018-12-23 20:13:33 The guy that ran the boing company will be the secretary of defense oh we know where we are going with this. Boing stocks just went up. What this guy know about the military beside charging  a lot for military equipment.
329 2018-12-23 20:13:14 Stocks the worst since 31, loses top negotiator,loses Attorney General, causes Government Shut down, tell us how we are winning Jerry!
330 2018-12-23 20:12:54 I really don’t need or want to read about it, i am just happy we are not a EU member as we have awesome healthcare, great welfare benefits and seem to be doing well with our investments in real estate (US, UK and France) , stocks and other endeavors around in the world
331 2018-12-23 20:12:14 Yeah the dtcc, r3, ripple collaboration involving stocks and derivatives is quadrillion dollar markets.  This is peanuts.
332 2018-12-23 20:11:45 Quit messing with the stocks Kevin! Trying to make a million dollars here lol
333 2018-12-23 20:10:50 Stocks and trading are becoming more prevalent and a lot of people want in. 

But too many people are just jumping in throwing their money on a guess and losing and then think oh okay so it's just a dub and you have to be lucky to get anywhere with this. 

No. 
(cont.)
334 2018-12-23 20:08:44 Stocks are in a slump still and another government shutdown. Cant keep anyone in office to work with him or for him. He's one of the most hypocritical people out there. And he's losing the support of his own party/people.
335 2018-12-23 20:08:13 Well in that case don’t feel bad for them. They made plenty of money. Actually stocks went up 10-15 fold. I think ppl should worry more on how expensive healthcare,housing, & education has become past 15 -20 years. Also the fact that most ppl are making the same salary past 20yrs
336 2018-12-23 20:07:49 @Kdog4268 remember markets are bear now and if trump don't get his wall more stocks will drop
337 2018-12-23 20:04:02 Fake news? People make money by shorting stocks all the time. The market doesn't have to go up to make money.
338 2018-12-23 20:04:02 I hope it does, i really do, but this is the worst December for stocks since the Great Depression, December is usually up with the amount of purchases being made for the holidays

342 2018-12-23 20:01:19 As soon as the stocks settle and things look up, it will once again be because of Obama’s “accomplishments”. lefties are so funny

348 2018-12-23 19:55:44 I take no glee in the market sputtering. I'm fortunate to be someone who has a good profit sharing, retirement plan. At the same time, fuck Trump and his his hypocrisy on it. It's terrible metric to use for the economy as the majority of people do not own stocks.
349 2018-12-23 19:55:17 I'm like its up 25%, how are your stocks doing?
350 2018-12-23 19:54:31 What about all the shootings here by American born maniacs ? Never hear you say or do anything about that. Finally bump stocks . At least someone told you to send this message to those devastated people in Indonesia.

360 2018-12-23 19:49:51 Average that out and you get Stocks down ~16% and Gold up ~890% over next 10 years.

Pretending you can out stock pick that is hubris.

Unless you’re talking gold stocks.

Cheers
361 2018-12-23 19:49:21 RSI above 90 means heavy upside momentum. Certain stocks(apple goog) stay above 90 on the weekly and sometimes daily for months at a time in a bullish trend.

I dont see $btc running up as quick as you say. A lot of big $ still has not bought in. We have more time to accumulate.
362 2018-12-23 19:49:19 he means put call ratio for sp 500 stocks. not for the entire equities market
363 2018-12-23 19:48:50 Is it just me or is the market going to crash this coming week ? Seeing a lot of desperate tweets from our president. Trying to put out there all "good" he has done. Before he is remember as one of the worst ones of our time. #president #market #crash #stocks
364 2018-12-23 19:48:49 Because their stocks tanked this week?

367 2018-12-23 19:46:17 People need to understand, #FPL is like the stock market.  You don't chase the stock by buying them when they're performing well.  You study the market and guess which stock is about to explode and buy before it does.  Also, selling premium stocks  anytime is very risky.
368 2018-12-23 19:45:50 Because no other Cannabis stock has dropped since then???  All stocks in general are down.

371 2018-12-23 19:44:00 Sadly Dave, we have seen the effects when not well regulated (e.g., wolf species, cougars in Eastern states, fish stocks, etc.).  I am horrified by the current administration's roll backs on the endangered species act & issuing of hunting permits in non-stabilized populations.

376 2018-12-23 19:42:48 Stocks are a gamble. I pulled out most before this happened so this is great for me.

382 2018-12-23 19:37:23 I don’t know.... gas prices at 1.90,  food prices are level, all my bills are the same or less, just got cost of living raise...  everything that matters to me is good...   I don’t own stocks or 401k so I don’t give a shit about the markets....
383 2018-12-23 19:37:23 That moment when the bank worker stocks the ATM with $20 bills that were printed in the early '90s.  The self checkout machines can't read them, and millennial workers think they're counterfeit bills.  #airingofgrievances
384 2018-12-23 19:35:53 Use to be the laughing stock now I’m laughing with stocks 
385 2018-12-23 19:35:47 Treasury just asked US saver to finance ~16 aircraft carriers last month.

FED showed up and said, we’re not helping, here finance 4 more.

Powell showed up Wednesday and said expect more of the same.

Sell stocks, and buy treasuries in size.
386 2018-12-23 19:35:05 A GREAT BIG TORY RECESSION

389 2018-12-23 19:30:32 We need to find out how our reps vote and how they spend their time. Maybe the papers can designate a section as they do with stocks to make it easy. There has never been a time when information could be so easily disseminated.
390 2018-12-23 19:29:51 No stocks !!
391 2018-12-23 19:29:46 Boeing stocks will go up!
392 2018-12-23 19:29:22 Stocks affect even those who don't own any. Retirement funds, companies you work for, or buy from, and many other considerations.
393 2018-12-23 19:28:37 Sounds like you've never experienced the power of supply/demand in buying stocks.  How cute, a terminal anti-trumper that doesn't understand stock structures.  That's weird.
394 2018-12-23 19:28:28 Oh from Boston I see so were you one of the ones that had to takeoff a week from work for PDT because Hillary didn’t get elected?  Do your DD on Trump like you do your DD on stocks you’d have a different opinion
395 2018-12-23 19:28:20 Lol most stocks are still way over priced. Look how far and fast many ran up since 09. I predict when it's all said and done  NDX will lose 60%
396 2018-12-23 19:28:12 Stocks just suffered their worst week since the Financial Crisis and the market is having its worst December since The Great Depression. The Nasdaq is officially in a bear market.  #TrumpResign #TrumpShutdown
397 2018-12-23 19:27:59 Lot of 20 year old millionaires of stocks these days
398 2018-12-23 19:27:58 very nice // when I should buy LH stocks ? #dax #börse
399 2018-12-23 19:27:43 WoW, you seriously are either playing dumb or you don’t know anything. The market always goes up eventually, but a 20% drop means ppl lost a lot of money. That means that lots of ppl who bought stocks 20% higher lost 20%. You know, ppl trade stocks, buy, sell. They didn’t make 20
400 2018-12-23 19:26:22 For stocks I bused tables then signed up for the military. Not only did I sign up but signed up for arguably one of the most difficult/dangerous jobs in the military because it paid a bonus lol. I did that just to save up the money to get started. THATS HOW BAD I WANTED IT.
401 2018-12-23 19:26:11 Anybody got any info on starting to invest in stocks and bonds/ trading?
402 2018-12-23 19:25:51 Liz Cheney has 14 million invested in defense stocks including Lockeed Tomahawk missiles used in Syria.
403 2018-12-23 19:25:36 @RepTedYoho  What happened to conservative principles?  US in financial trouble - stocks tumbling ,  deficits high, inflation looms , and you still support this moron of a president.
404 2018-12-23 19:25:22 Klar, müssen das 2 Minuten wegen hohen Stocks sein, aber wie unsportlich kann man eigentlich sein, Daniel Weiß? #MANvsNIT
405 2018-12-23 19:25:04 Well, I have researched most of it and am THRILLED.  The stocks need to reset to take out the most wealthy, (how do you NOT know this???) Trump always is 10 steps ahead of resignations...they are on purpose.  Hold on tight, it is going to get even more wild.  Thank heavens!!!
406 2018-12-23 19:24:29 If you take unfounded credit for the stock market's rise, shouldn't you then own the sharp decline in stocks that is due to you?  

All you?

#JustAskin'
407 2018-12-23 19:24:26 I think he's doing the bidding for the democrats, purposely tanking the stocks to make it look bad for Trump. But the economy is doing so good, maybe they can raise them. They couldn't raise them when it was Obama's economy, people were eating out of garbage cans with his economy
408 2018-12-23 19:23:18 US Stocks:  Amazon (AMZN) - how much of its debt is financed at 0%, or close to it, I wonder.  And how much of its debt is hidden from view?   How come no one is looking and digging into it, I wonder...
409 2018-12-23 19:22:25 Just for the heck of it, wonder what senators’s areas defense plants would be effected by a big withdrawal of our troops? Which ones own stocks in this companies? Guess I’m getting paranoid.
410 2018-12-23 19:21:32 Kenyans are corrupt and nepotistic fellows. Give a Kenyan Safaricom. 1 year you'll see how the stocks plummet. Thats not to say that we dont have exceptional CEO's. Safaricom is just too big of a shark. Collymore has made it global. Thats a fact that is well laid down.
411 2018-12-23 19:20:59 short HSBC and BAT stocks now to fund this financial haemorrhage of a lifestyle
412 2018-12-23 19:20:13 99 stocks
413 2018-12-23 19:20:02 Yup. If QT is successfully ended. Bonds may take a hit but less than stocks.. if QT has any pause.. becomes QE stocks and bonds go up. Only in event of permanent debt monetization (1970’s) do bonds get slaughtered. I think that happens.. but a lot of time between
414 2018-12-23 19:17:33 Baker you're as dumb as this chick, remember it was your president who said he would take the mantle and be proud to shut down the government. Seems you really are the sheep I believe you are, and propaganda spreader, you try to accuse me of. Oh btw how are your stocks doing?
415 2018-12-23 19:16:19 QT will reduce income inequality since all asset prices will deflate and the 1% own the majority of assets.  Look at the shareholders of FANG stocks.  Over 1 trillion wipe out.
416 2018-12-23 19:15:45 Wait, wait, whoa dude. I have been studying markets a while now. Its not that simple. By reducing what people can make on fixed income investments (bonds) it forced people that want to make a decent return on their investments into equities (stocks and options)...
417 2018-12-23 19:15:40 Friend was complaining last night that with stocks falling she would need to work for another ten years
For years, while the market was high, I told her to move money to safer investments
She didn't - because of greed
now she pays
418 2018-12-23 19:14:16 the same argument also goes like this: Investors, or their computers, “are buying because stocks are rising, not because of changes to the fundamentals”. Algos are by design 100 percent speculative investing.
419 2018-12-23 19:13:54 Likely will have a bounce of stocks prior to year end.  Imo
420 2018-12-23 19:13:54 Took a little $XLF via $FAS at the close. Hope if we get a bump in oil prices this will help stocks.
421 2018-12-23 19:12:58 Some individual stocks stopped going down already though
422 2018-12-23 19:12:33 That’s not how stocks are valued, that’s profit margin. Stock values account for a holistic response by all participants based upon their individual preferences. Price per earnings ($ of price/$ profit) varies wildly between stocks. 1/?
423 2018-12-23 19:12:06 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
424 2018-12-23 19:11:20 I want all the stocks.
425 2018-12-23 19:10:25 No privately owned business is legally associated with the public unless it has stocks that are traded on the public market. Business 101.

432 2018-12-23 19:06:05 @FoxNewsSunday chris you should be fair. No fake news. Mattis was fired by Obama and press said nothing. The wall is needed. Trump is bringing troops back heroes. Stocks down due to Obama FED.
433 2018-12-23 19:04:24 good question, don't think so... not sure how you might define it - stocks with most margin buying? (is that data even available?>?)
434 2018-12-23 19:03:33 @ItsAnguiano13 bro, any cannabis stocks you’re looking into investing? I have a feeling one might have huge potential.
435 2018-12-23 19:03:07 That doesn't argue for the value of these stocks.
436 2018-12-23 19:02:27 I lost 600 fucking dollars on stocks wtf is going on ! These trade deals fuse with China is really fucking things up
437 2018-12-23 19:02:12 You guys can stand up for nunchucks but not for bump stocks? Are you kidding me?
438 2018-12-23 19:01:43 if stocks perhaps not.
if bonds, only a little
439 2018-12-23 19:00:41 Dude who knows I hate him and his politics came into my bar last night,

Fucking COOL Shannon
440 2018-12-23 19:00:36 Yes, there was a point that JYPE was valued higher over YG and SM. But a few months ago there was a plummet of Korean stocks which affected the Big 3. Not sure right now if JYPE is still the one at the top.
441 2018-12-23 18:59:26 I'm not sure of the current status but at one time the Trump family owned Boeing stocks-  Military contracts could now be promised or awarded increasing the value of the stocks
442 2018-12-23 18:59:06 If you are invested in a 401k,  you own stocks.
443 2018-12-23 18:57:46 Does the UK still have 'drawing & quartering' on the books?

444 2018-12-23 18:55:54 Speaking purely technically, there hasn't been a confirmation of SR flip at 6.5k as well,which should mean the price should revisit the area. Had it been a commodity or crypto, it would've been a high probability thing. Regarding stocks, can't say with confidence
445 2018-12-23 18:54:40 Didnt JYP surpassed them a few months ago in terms of market cap? I read that market cap is the most important factor in stocks/investment? Or is SM still bigger?
446 2018-12-23 18:53:43 You can see the chart, it suggests early 2019 will be decision maker... ironically 2019 general elections in #India  at same time could seriously impact the stocks
447 2018-12-23 18:53:34 Because you are running the country into the ground, the way you ran your businesses into the ground.  Gov’t shutdown, stocks worst in 10 years, no allies, tax cut for rich, cabinet members leaving........
448 2018-12-23 18:52:46 You have to start being honest, yes the economy was going well, yes the unemployment rate is low, yes, the stocks are higher than they were in 2017, end of 2016, yes Trump had 2 good GDP Q. Yes he created manu jobs. To say he reversed a trend is false, completely false.

450 2018-12-23 18:52:29 Stock market have been pumped up by Govts around the world as they look at them as measure of their economic performance. As such, global economy is on the doorstep to recession. Choice is yours. Either a correction in stocks or devaluation of INR. One of these 2 has to happen
451 2018-12-23 18:52:27 Sir many of these stocks were hitting upper circuits in 2017 . A great lesson for me . I am happy I have seen my first bear market at age 25

454 2018-12-23 18:49:48 @andrewrocco1 I thought this week's Take on the Market was particularly good. I liked your comments about not changing strategies with growth stocks during a market correction because they get hit much harder than value stocks. Very good advice.
455 2018-12-23 18:49:21 Does he have stocks or a 401k?
456 2018-12-23 18:48:28  have them tarred, feathered and put in the stocks #wotwot #ruperts
457 2018-12-23 18:47:50 One kink in your plan.   STOCKS!   BTC and stocks are correlated. This is fact. BTC is also slower to react.  A retest will show soon.  Not advice.  Lower to maybe 3500-3700 and then back to $6k.
458 2018-12-23 18:47:31 Been my concerns all year. Trump eased in to 2017, feigned nice, was pro business, then revealed his true colours and ineptitude

People who funded him, pumped the Trump bump got out of stocks early, leaving regular citizens they leech off of as bag-holders, not warned or guided.
459 2018-12-23 18:46:54 I'm not entirely sure why everybody settled on 6 minutes. 3 stocks is good though.
460 2018-12-23 18:46:52 What you think "hoarded" capital is? It doesn't sit in a mattress. They're always in stocks and bonds.
461 2018-12-23 18:46:46 Your point on Americans wealth being more tied to the Markets than ever is so spot on. People have 401ks, 403b,s IRAs, ROTH IRAs, heck Pensions, both from govt and from pvt industry, are reliant on what happens in stocks. We've been told to use portfolios to plan for retirement.
462 2018-12-23 18:46:45 We are at the first true test of #Crypto... If the invisible hand truly works we should see a transition from regular #stocks & #bonds to #cryptocurrencies (instead of liquid #cash) as markets tumble over the the coming weeks.

465 2018-12-23 18:44:18 You, who righteously preach fealty to facts, steadfastly ignore those offered, that the top 10% own 84% of stocks, leaving 16% for the bottom 90%, and that the "most Americans" claim is only true nominally, in that "most" means 54%.  Your sneering about "remarkable" wrongness...

469 2018-12-23 18:42:36 Do you believe that our current situation in stocks is analogous to 2000, when laughably crappy companies were going public left and right with no way of making money?
470 2018-12-23 18:42:26 It’s the truth. Loads of manufacturer out of stocks and pharmacists struggling to buy at Drug Tariff prices which means they’re out of pocket

473 2018-12-23 18:39:13 My thought.   US stocks companies received a tax cut.  Earnings up despite modest underlying business growth.   2020 Democrats will come to power and raise, as they should, corporate taxes to repair debt problems.   Earnings will go down.  EM don’t have this issue.  Trump an ass.

480 2018-12-23 18:36:50 Nobody was happier to take credit for surging stocks than @realDonaldTrump , who touted and tweeted each leg up. Now the bull is on life support and the search for its killer is on - via @business.

@realDonaldTrump, your poor little thing.
481 2018-12-23 18:36:02 Yer ridiculous in that case given you are simply doing TA. Otherwise any trading site is "shilling" stocks or currencies
482 2018-12-23 18:35:47 They don't care about the stock market, most of Trumps supporters don't have the money left over to invest in stocks.
483 2018-12-23 18:34:04 Aww poor baby. How are your stocks looking now?

490 2018-12-23 18:29:08 Went great for me and the other middle class folks I know.

509 2018-12-23 18:16:34 We are on the same side, but in all honesty, stocks can affect the average American. Many companies who match 401ks force the hands of their employees to invest in the market. I know a lot of people with this situation. Their retirement funds have been getting slammed
510 2018-12-23 18:16:29 The company still made money and was in positive territory. Most stocks lost money in the last month.
511 2018-12-23 18:15:59 Time to buy defense stocks? If the US pulls back, locals will have to buy more planes and tanks for individual defense than under Pax Americana.

513 2018-12-23 18:15:03 Even if I buy back at $99 or $98, I gain. To me I don’t need to pick a bottom to benefit. It’s a bit of a risk as the price may never go lower but it’s just as risky to never sell (the price may never get back to $100) I’d never sell with stocks on the way down but when at highs
514 2018-12-23 18:14:19 Less than half of Americans have ANY stock savings and 80% have less than one year’s income in their retirement. Meanwhile, 85% of stock wealth is held by the richest 10%.

Stocks are good for some 72-year-olds and good for me (I own some) but not as important as we are told.

So you believe in holding the stocks?
518 2018-12-23 18:05:47 I wonder how much of those stocks you own.

523 2018-12-23 18:00:47 As there's a sell-off and investors no longer have an appetite to invest or to buy stocks. we will see a lot of companies will file for bankruptcy and I am not too worried about the markets but to enjoy myself to have a sound and good night sleep.

531 2018-12-23 17:53:22 The way the markets are behaving and to where it's heading, I don't think it has any ultimate chance to recover soon enough. For me it's a steep mountain to climb & before we reach to the top, our financial goals are too exhausted that to buy stocks no longer becomes our priority
532 2018-12-23 17:52:10 Electric revolution for battery minerals, lack of investment in new mining projects in the last 7 years due to the mining downturn.Decreased ore grades around the globe especially copper and overvalued tech and non commodity stocks. Commodity stocks could end up a safe haven!
533 2018-12-23 17:50:22 This month is a record weakening of stocks. By the 21st, the Dow's average reduction is 3093 dollars, the largest in a single month, more than twice the October 2008 ($ 1,525) just after the second largest Lehman shock.
534 2018-12-23 17:50:06 The @TASE_en is closed on Fridays, so Sunday trading moves are partly a response to price movements on #WallStreet on Thursday and Friday, especially in stocks like $TEVA & $NICE which are dual-listed

535 2018-12-23 17:49:40 As much as I want to agree I also wonder if it will as funds are likely distengrsting, Passive ETFs working in reverse, YE tax selling for 1st time since 09, panicking inv who said stocks will never go down learning they do, worsening news/data & more.

537 2018-12-23 17:47:56 Weren't you also saying recently you pay more tax now than you used to earn? Similar situation for many millenials, who are starting to save for retirement in earnest. Cheaper the stocks the better.

542 2018-12-23 17:41:14 I did, thanks, but it came from $4.5T new $ QE printing and $9T deficit spend. Stocks should grow from economic growth from good policies. Today we are hurting stock market unwinding that $4.5T lump of Obama Fed sludge since Fed thinks Trump economy can withstand it. (?)
543 2018-12-23 17:41:09 Does anyone know about investing or stocks or point me in the right direction on learning about them?

546 2018-12-23 17:35:54 It's all about you investing policy statement.  I am 90% stocks,  so might as well be 100%. Its what helps you sleep at night. Just remember - The higher the yield in general,  the higher the risk. Also depends on your horizon.  Do you have 5 years or 30 years?
547 2018-12-23 17:35:05 I wouldnt think there's anything special - most of the big sovereign funds own chunks of most major blue chip stocks - esp the petro sheikdoms, it's not like they have much of anything to invest in at home except a few date orchards..

Would you buy it?
552 2018-12-23 17:32:13 I didn’t know the 30 day wash rule doesn’t apply . It encourages anybody who bought a btc above today’s price @$3900 to sell, and buy it back later (even 2 minutes later) , and reap the tax loss benefit. You can’t do this with equities (stocks). You have to wait 30 days.
553 2018-12-23 17:30:15 BTW... Bump stocks needed to go, not because if responsible owners playing, but because of homicidal/suicidal individuals killing many with them.  These laws need to be nationwide and uniform... And reasonable...

557 2018-12-23 17:29:03 Everyone knows buying low and selling high is the name of the game but most can't help but hate the market and their stocks at the lows and love them the most at their highs.
558 2018-12-23 17:29:02 Stocks are down maybe 5% from the beginning of the year. If you lost “everything” then you were in one or two highly volatile stocks or options or something high risk. Dollar cost average over the last 30 years and you made a lot of money, despite the major crashes along the way
559 2018-12-23 17:27:47 No one said Capitalism was bad again you have issues reading.

I said Capitalism turned into greed.

560 2018-12-23 17:27:32 There's a BIG difference between healthcare insurance industy stocks and healthcare industry stocks.  You act like there'll be no more medical practitioners, medicines or hospitals.
561 2018-12-23 17:26:10 What I have written is sarcasm. Check the tweet I am quoting from. Multicap 35 has amongst the lowest churn in the industry. We don’t trade in and out of stocks.
562 2018-12-23 17:26:07 Stocks take steps to climb up and lift to come down. Stocks can fall 5 Percent r more when market opens and becomes difficult to manage sold put options. As a beginner always trade indices rather than stocks as it will be less volatile still there r some exceptions
563 2018-12-23 17:26:06 Sir, BJP was in power until few days back.  They sure know the status and stocks of materials & resources.  Cant they prove the lies of these Cong looters?  Shouldn't they hit roads?
564 2018-12-23 17:25:59 Historically home retail stocks performed poorly during periods of slowdown in housing. CS issued a good report on this topic a couple of months ago.
565 2018-12-23 17:25:51 I dont know, but warehousing stocks that would normally be sold would certainly be a cost for the suppliers that they wouldn't normally have.
566 2018-12-23 17:25:28 The Democrats are merely driving the 'bump-stocks' thin end of the wedge harder into The Second Amendment with the intent of eventual banning of weapons. 

If The Second Amendment falls so does The Bill of RIghts and The Fifth Amendment (the only one they remember and support)
567 2018-12-23 17:24:16 The fed is doing the right thing for the economy. Stocks way overvalued, and Dow needs to come down another few thousand to be close to value.  Not fed’s job to prop up stocks artificially.
568 2018-12-23 17:23:55 What a wack job.  I actually know a guy who ran a pump and dump on penny stocks.  They got like 220 million.  Big deal case.  He only got 18 years in white collar jail.
569 2018-12-23 17:21:54 Is this advise like buy small stocks because of tax cuts (but did not tell you they have no profits to benefit) and they are the worst performers because of tax cuts and impact on interest rates. Don't listen to this guy, Canadian conservatives new this and did not choose him
570 2018-12-23 17:20:07 It’s the plot armor dude. I felt so confident in my first two games against him, and was up in stocks both games. He somehow always secures his wins; I refuse to have this be a curse again LOL

577 2018-12-23 17:15:40 That is a fun video but I don't think it shows amounts of grain that some scenes would have where faster stocks would be needed. If Cuaron rated the 65 at 800 he would need to push film 1 stop to use similar light levels adding even more grain.
578 2018-12-23 17:15:06 If you're going to worry about short-term volatility, you're just not going to be able to buy the cheapest stocks. With the cheapest stocks, the outlooks are uncertain. - Richard Pzena

586 2018-12-23 17:09:39 Hey Bridget! You can also do the following:
1-Choose a stock
2-Decide how much you want to buy
3-Buy in 4 tranches, 1 tranche every 1-2 month
4-Profit!

This way you don't have to time the market, if price goes down you keep winning averaging down on winning stocks
587 2018-12-23 17:09:21 Virtue signaling much?. Is there a metric to make sure that people from impoverished backgrounds get assets as well? I am not sure being Black or a women from a upwardly mobile background has anything to do with analyzing stocks to determine profitability potential are you?
588 2018-12-23 17:09:03 Wh- But I already asked around for stocks. :(
589 2018-12-23 17:08:34 Yup, you touched a nerve in a lot of people. A lot of folks thought it would be cool to have a brash, outspoken, maverick in charge. We call those people “morons”....and I hope they have no health coverage now and their stocks are worthless as they sit waiting for coal to return.
590 2018-12-23 17:08:27 Glad that pro gun organizations are going to have this illegal ban turned over. It’s not about bump stocks, but the 4th and 5th amendments. The right to property and due process!
591 2018-12-23 17:05:25 Crooked Hilary IS a lair! Mexico IS paying for the wall.. directly to Trump! Ices is defeeted and we won! And that’s how we wanted it! It must be true because Trump said so! Trump knows NK has no nucular bombs because Kim denies it! And stocks is up. NO COLLUSION! WHITCH HUNT!

602 2018-12-23 16:59:23 We’ve been in one of the longest (most hated) bull markets for ten years. Pundits were worried about expensive/high PE stocks and telling you not to buy. Now?

606 2018-12-23 16:55:25 Ir you think the fundamentals of SX remained intact after the deal fell through before the drop from 20's to 5c then you should not be investing in the stock market. Also you attempting to link these stocks (no comparison) makes you ignorant of the potential of them, spec. GRAT
607 2018-12-23 16:54:57 I'm a trader. I don't 'invest' in these penny stocks. If the opportunity is there I will get back in. However I didnt see the action that I was hoping for on Friday. This is still on watch for next week.
608 2018-12-23 16:54:34 Another sucker! How long will this one last?We can rest assured that any choice you make will be someone who shares your views on everything, another disadvantage to every American who’s not wealthy, has a 401k & owns stocks and bonds, the 1% you cater to constantly!
609 2018-12-23 16:53:48 @indian_stockss happy birthday to one of the nicest persons I have known . A straightforward and honest advisor about stocks whose knowledge about companies is commonsensical and of course an awesome TA. May your tribe increase !
610 2018-12-23 16:53:01 Think one of the UK stores stocks them, maybe firestorm?
611 2018-12-23 16:52:47 I feel your pain and also blame Trump. However, the reality is that stocks are way up over the last 10 years. It’s not as bad as your statement. You didn’t lose everything.
612 2018-12-23 16:51:49 Hey can u name me the democrat that will run against Trump in 2020 that will say we need more troops in Syria and Afghanistan? lol nobody will.  Lol that’s the beauty of Trump. He’s not a republican...he signed criminal reform, he banned bump stocks on guns and now pulling troops
613 2018-12-23 16:51:44 Happy holidays! Hopefully you aren’t waiting for a check. DJT and Lindsey Graham aren’t. Congress still gets paid when the government is shut down.  I’m a Veteran and educated.  How’s that tax cut helping you now? Stocks down, signing farm bill to pay farmers bc tariffs = Loser.
614 2018-12-23 16:51:08 Lol. I agree. Jim Rogers has a similar opinion. Because too much money has gone into too few stocks, those "trusted" blue chip names in every ETF will fall further than anyone expects. Good short opportunities coming (or are here?) if you know where to look.
615 2018-12-23 16:50:57 Obviously the legal sale of bump stocks (until recently) negate your first point. Also the chances of a tyrannical government increase significantly when you elect a tyrant as is the incumbent imbecile. Reform of the electoral system would be a better move than arming lunatics.
616 2018-12-23 16:50:42 Why don't you do more to stop gun violence in our country? Banning bump stocks was a good start. Now take it all the way home. Ban automatic weapons and ammo that shreds humans flesh.
617 2018-12-23 16:50:29 Why wouldn’t it? Stocks have been going up for 10 years and crypto has had almost a 90% correction. Timing looks pretty good to me.
618 2018-12-23 16:49:05 Yes a pack of cartoon flame, electric, water stocks

Its name is 'Core Pack'.It is available on youtube but other stuff are not in any packs i download it from google etc.
619 2018-12-23 16:48:58 Shifting money amongst stocks might be the better trend than pullout and liquidating. More stable and fun overall.
620 2018-12-23 16:48:09 yes and the tax cuts will pay for themselves AGAIN,did not.  the tax cut will raise wages,did not. they will invest the money,instead of buying back stocks as THEY said they would,they bought stocks back . 2cents it the avg bonus people got.18 states raised min wage on jan 1 2018

622 2018-12-23 16:45:55 Thats exactly the question; how or why was such huge stocks of weapons inside a holy site, barring swords which are a part of the Sikh religion? For long, there were efforts to calm the tension down with militants, as the operation didnt happen in a day. It was war against state

624 2018-12-23 16:44:59 Should have sold my stocks and taken the money to buy survivalist supplies. You know things are bad when a man nicknamed "Mad Dog" was likely the least stark raving mad person of this administration.
625 2018-12-23 16:44:44 So buy stocks in Werner. Since all these people are "pouring" in, this would mean a boom for foreign aluminum.
626 2018-12-23 16:43:54 China markets have fallen 30% from their most recent peak, and even the 7% recent fall induces more pain than S&P 16% fall, given Chinese stocks are already at multi year lows. Plus, Chinese stocks should resume faster fall now, as fund rotation into Asia comes to end
627 2018-12-23 16:43:36 Bwaaahahahahaha GM is making decisions to hopefully sell more vehicles. Maybe stocks are down due to the THREE times interest rates have been raised? Job market is still great! #MAGA
628 2018-12-23 16:43:14 Everyone that wanted a bump stock already has them. Like fake Mexican viagra, there will now be a black market for them that's completely uncontrolled and unregulated. 

Millions of bump stocks can now be imported and sold.
629 2018-12-23 16:41:34 The GOA and others believe that in the long-term, bump stocks will serve as the lever the gun grabbers ultimately need to incrementally take everything. Given the way this particular law was written, I tend to believe the GOA view.

For an average investor BIG wealth in stocks markets is not made by BIG investment ideas. 

It is made by AVOIDING big stock blowups! 

U will do great by merely surviving for a very long time.

633 2018-12-23 16:39:53 It's good your shorting and making money, cos when shit goes down and stocks all fall you can make a shit load of money from it. Man I really need to learn how to short.
634 2018-12-23 16:39:51 Unlike GOA et. al. the NRA said long ago they did not view bump stocks as an issue they were willing to fight for. They seem to be taking the short-term view that they are toys not worth expending political capital.
635 2018-12-23 16:39:23 Many investors have tens of thousands in stocks. Soo many. Why wouldn’t they put like 10.000usd in crypto as high risk/big reward investments? I would. Actually all my cash is in crypto right now.
636 2018-12-23 16:37:54 @realDonaldTrump Mr President will all due respect give us the gift of a new year and step down.  Let your VP take over and finish out your term.  Stocks are a mess, your children are caught up in your Russian mess, we are losing allies and your support team is leaving you behind
637 2018-12-23 16:37:39 They have been buying back their own stocks for years propping up the failing economy. There is NO MONEY only iou's on the stock exchange. It's all Fake.

642 2018-12-23 16:33:39 My pharmacist told me a while ago that he was told to keep stocks high. He also said that prices were rising monthly and a lot more genetics were being used.
643 2018-12-23 16:33:11 Good Time To Buy Stocks And Hold It For A Few Years
644 2018-12-23 16:31:58 And an over haul of 2A is justified. The NRA narrative is fear based nonsense. Common ground on many levels will be found by Dem. Congress in next 2 years. Don't forget to turn in your bump-stocks!

Corporations stocks buying backs instead of investing in workers and capital 
Inflation 
National debt highest ever
648 2018-12-23 16:30:55 They are all out to make trump fail to teach us a lesson not to elect outsiders who want to MAGA! It’s is painfully obvious the corruption of our judicial system and the highest ranks in the government. Keep your bump stocks you’re going to need them
649 2018-12-23 16:30:31 I think even Saudi Market was open...Yes Overall Israel Stocks were down...but major cut was seen in one company Perrigo which was down 29%( Its Included in TA-35 Index)

651 2018-12-23 16:30:00 Out of eight major asset classes tracked by Bloomberg, just two are on track to deliver positive total returns this year. Treasury bills top the list, which tells its own story, while emerging-market stocks fare worst - Bloomberg
652 2018-12-23 16:29:59 Nothing? You retweeted somebody the other day saying the banning of bump stocks 15 months after Vegas would help stop them.

654 2018-12-23 16:29:48 Society and organizations and firms base your competence and potential but that shouldn’t be your financial base or limit. Education is a pathway. Entrepreneurship is a solution. Investments is a solution. Stocks and bonds are solutions.

ZIMBABWE is headed for a dry festive season as stocks of soft drinks are expected to run out after Delta beverages shut down its plants citing inadequate foreign currency to keep them running.

657 2018-12-23 16:25:32 Buyers are going to be so happy when this bear ends and they can buy stocks at a discount to fair value. If they choose to ride it all the way to the bottom then they will not be allowed to play in the next round. Darwinism.

665 2018-12-23 16:21:07 I truly think Democrat politicians are trying to get Trump elected again.I think they are making so much money from personal stocks that they want him to be elected again.Russian hysteria isn’t going to work & they know it. Democrat politicians are making huge profits from Trump!
666 2018-12-23 16:20:13 wdym? out of stock na ang wbb or what? HAHAHAHAHA dahil kung wbb man lang... si grizz at panpan ang put of stock but ice bear? maramiiiiiiiiiiiiing stocks ang miniso :>>> well, depends sa kung anong version na plushies ang gusto mo hehe

670 2018-12-23 16:17:26 Epic fail Kevin. 1st of all Nike stocks surged so on the topic of boycotting Nike, you failed. Secondly, who the eff told u I’m going barefoot?  I am as financially secure as I could ever be. But then again ur dumb ass would never know 
671 2018-12-23 16:17:23 Now I know you are too willing to believe lies about her & not really worth my time, but her political career is over. You should be far more concerned about the Putin enabler currently in the WH, as the government is shut down, stocks tumble, & Putin aggressively advances.
672 2018-12-23 16:17:09 Linda Linda Listen!! So if I sell a few bump stocks inside the Yellow Rose will the Travis County District Attorney’s office prosecute me? What if I choke or hit my bump stock but I don't bruise it, can I be prosecuted?
673 2018-12-23 16:16:38 Stocks today are hardly "down" relative to most fundamental measures.  Valuation at the time of purchase will be the single biggest factor of future returns.  Two interesting charts are included below.
674 2018-12-23 16:15:39 It’s amazing how so many people waste their weekends bashing stocks. It’s the weekend guys, go watch some football and put twitter down. The markets are closed 
675 2018-12-23 16:14:43 Thanks for the reply:)
But, how to gauge the movement for stocks??
676 2018-12-23 16:14:40 The government is shut down, stocks are down and ppl are quitting his administration like crazy. That's reality honey.
677 2018-12-23 16:14:05 I can’t understand how ppl fall for this loom foolishness when there are so many legitimate investment opportunities out there. So many IPOs have come out between last year and now, some listed stocks rallying on the local market.. but you choose loom ?
678 2018-12-23 16:13:33 Hayhay .......USA stocks down down every day
679 2018-12-23 16:12:01 Pls stop putting 5 mins on FD with three stocks ppl
680 2018-12-23 16:11:47 @realDonaldTrump shuts down the gov't for Christmas. 
McGurk quits, while DJT claims total victory over ISIS.
Still in the midst of Trade Wars, forcing the Farm Bailouts, that Sen Grassley filed for!
NK still making nukes.
Stocks plunged, wiping out retirements...
Done winning!
681 2018-12-23 16:10:47 Never thought I'd see LI stocks compared to The Browns, but if this is an indicator of the sector, we really are in trouble.
682 2018-12-23 16:10:31 This bozo president takes credit when stocks surge but stays quiet when stocks dip.
683 2018-12-23 16:09:21 @Micromania_Fr Pratique douteuse de vendre avant Noël des produits en stock en retrait magasin 1h. Faire des Kms pour retirer l'achat et les stocks sont out depuis ce matin. #ecommerceDeMerde. Aucun message pas de mail d'annulation

688 2018-12-23 16:08:00 The money didn’t go “nowhere”.  It went into a massive pump-and-dump scheme.  The people who engineered the buy-backs walked away with all of the tax-break as they sold off their inflated stocks.  Stock prices are relaxing back to where they were before the buyback madness.
689 2018-12-23 16:06:39 @POTUS Shemah, O Trumpians it's the end of sanity. Shutdown, Diving stocks, Ally betrayal, Enemy cheers. Shit rains. It's YOURS. (Jared can translate the first word for you.  But YOU won't listen)
690 2018-12-23 16:06:10 2/ A sharp rally may happen based on history but will it while funds are likely collapsing/liquidating, global economies looking at/in recession, YE tax selling intensifies for 1st time in many years and inv who said stocks will never fall learn they do fall HARD and panic
691 2018-12-23 16:06:06 If one is investing long-term, one must simply buy more at lower prices. If one is investing short-term, one shouldn’t be in stocks in the first place. Mass media should educate rather than flame the hysteria
692 2018-12-23 16:05:56 Lines up with a bounce in stocks this week?
693 2018-12-23 16:05:15 Only if the companies don't have the cash.  They have the cash.  They've been sitting on it for a while.  They won't buy back stocks if it meant not growing or being at risk of too little of cash on hand.  Your 401K's love this.
694 2018-12-23 16:05:08 What saved the markets from 09 on will not work from here on. QE & tax cuts saved stocks, not our economy that is 1/2+ the GDP of all prior cycles AFTER 9 years of QE, ZIRP, $5T in stimi & more. I think WS gets this. Not sure what comparisons apply here but history isn't it.
695 2018-12-23 16:04:28 Don’t let the macro (bearish luxury) confuse the relative strength of Tesla vs competitors. We’ve been reading about Tesla killers in EV for five years. But this time is different? History isn’t kind to shorting stocks with R&D and % of sales double competition.
696 2018-12-23 16:04:21 Sector and asset class breakdown disclosed on the fact sheets, not specific stocks. This also makes the Protea funds appropriate for those who require blind investments.

Disclosing individual shorts is often misunderstood by the management team of the shorted company.

701 2018-12-23 16:01:18 I'll probably get clobbered for this (again) but I love the JSE. It has given me the most wonderful life and every time I stray too far into foreign stocks I start losing money. So no, I follow and buy the indices, but not the stocks - apart from a few in Oz.
702 2018-12-23 15:59:18 I wasn't expecting this Syria move by #Trump so it might not be exactly as advertised. But, we do know who is adversaries are and they are complaining loudly now. If they are losing money on their defence stocks doesn't that give #Trump a good day at the office?

710 2018-12-23 15:53:44 Hi Karin, do you track international stocks as well?
711 2018-12-23 15:52:08 2/ A sharp rally should happen based on history but will it as funds are likely collapsing/liquidating, global economies looking at recession, YE tax selling intensifies for 1st time in many years and inv who said stocks will never fall learn they do fall HARD and panic
712 2018-12-23 15:51:49 80% of stocks are 20% off their highs, 29% are 50% off their highs, 12% are 70% off their highs.  You'd think markets would be in a lot worse shape.

714 2018-12-23 15:51:18 so, does this mean you think corporations are having a hard time making ends meet?  I don't think so. They used their tax cuts to buy back their own stocks, not to give raises to those who work for them

716 2018-12-23 15:50:31 The only way to stop corruption, racism, treason, dishonesty, incompetence, and much else from ruining our country is for you to resign. Impeachment and placing you in courtyard stocks would be fun, but only good old fashioned imprisonment will really work.
717 2018-12-23 15:50:16 Not quite true ..... bump stocks are banned, as you advocated
718 2018-12-23 15:50:08 Politicians don't care if America fails. Children are torn away from their parents, tear gas being used on innocent ppl,  EPA not protecting  environment, public lands being sold, isolationist foreign policy, plunging stocks, withdrawal from treaties. We are Winning!

721 2018-12-23 15:47:56 I think the rising rate cycle has already started... the fed attempting to short circuit it will “work” short term and get tlt to 160+ and bring on a huge bust. In the interim months, inflation stocks are the place to be.
722 2018-12-23 15:47:54 1st year economic success generally credited to previous prez. & 2nd year and after to sitting prez. Economy(stocks) tanking, international relations LOW, oil co's, farmers, small biz struggling, recession concerns in the air.

728 2018-12-23 15:45:20 Extend the time period of your chart and you will find that EM stocks were early to the correction. A correction can be like puberty, which does not always arrive at the same time in all cases.

731 2018-12-23 15:42:52 I hope it's stocks.
732 2018-12-23 15:42:41 The stock is where it was on Dec 14, and that’s more than most stocks can say. So I’ll give you that.
733 2018-12-23 15:42:33 @LuminaraEurope are your remotes compatible with Mirage candles?  My mirage remote is broken and the store now only stocks your products.
734 2018-12-23 15:41:58 What about the drones you can fly right over that wall with drugs and drop them off. A wall doesnt stop anything. Maybe slow it down. Maybe it gives some temprary jobs, and maybe it boosts your construction or steel stocks a bit but it doesnt stop what you are saying.
735 2018-12-23 15:41:17 US stocks are still highly overvalued, even moreso if optimistic earnings projections are downgraded or not met.
736 2018-12-23 15:41:11 The stocks are sliding because Democrats are coming into Power in the House & have already said they are going after Businesses once again.

743 2018-12-23 15:39:29 His scam was investigated several times by the feds and nothing done... people were literally throwing money at him never did he solicite any money yet the top ten Clients walk free?  Who believes in a 100% return on investment?  Fools stocks are rigged but sheep want it easy
744 2018-12-23 15:39:10 And tell all your repub colleagues to sell all their defense stocks .....then maybe you'll truly want the war to end.
745 2018-12-23 15:38:11 Hahahahaahaha Bump stocks hahahahahahahahaha
I can do the same thing with my belt loop and a shoestring.
Haaahahajahahahahahahahaha
746 2018-12-23 15:37:16 The market is the worst it's been in years. All my stocks are down. I should just keep buying books. :)
747 2018-12-23 15:37:13 I voted, but I think this should have been made more clear. We are not trying to ban all guns. We are asking for common sense gun laws. We do want to ban bump stocks. @MomsDemand
748 2018-12-23 15:36:43 It’s the 2 Phil’s lads, don’t pay any attention. The poor laughing stocks deserve pity and nothing else. I feel desperately sorry for them
749 2018-12-23 15:36:02 I could say the same thing. But the question for you is do you believe in the company and it’s Therapeutics. If you do, this is temporary. If you have doubts, better to get out. When we invest in these stocks, we all take risks knowing that it could be completely wiped out.
750 2018-12-23 15:35:33 Bargains are here and will continue to be created... option buying VERY TRICKY here as bottom will be very volatile as cross-currents continue and option prices EXTREMELY elevated.  Common stock a much better choice here, or, selling puts on stocks YOU WANT.
751 2018-12-23 15:34:12 didn't anyone tell you NOT to look at your 401k? don't look at it. do not look at it. wait until 10 years before you plan to retire to look at it. If you hear markets go down, then great more stocks at a lower price so buy more.
752 2018-12-23 15:33:45 Since you’re able to predict the future, what stocks should I invest in for 2019?

755 2018-12-23 15:32:47 Schumer did say he would delay all appointments.

When you have 8 yrs of free money, I mean quantitative easing rates have to rise.  Health stocks dropped after the ruling, which shows that they were dependent on subsidies.

He's not under investigation.
756 2018-12-23 15:32:40 Not necessarily. The real Q... are he, his kids' or their shell companies buying or selling? Best way to make money. You know w/every tweet it rocks the market, makes it easier to control your stocks. Just saying.
757 2018-12-23 15:31:52 It’s common for stocks to jump on earnings. It’s still down 13 dollars since the Kaep ad.

764 2018-12-23 15:26:58 A question for the financial economists out there:

1/ If we are going to start substituting Net Payout Yield for Dividend Yield in our discount models to derive capital market assumptions for stocks, why do we define Net Payout Yield as Divs + Stock Buybacks - Stock Issuance?
765 2018-12-23 15:26:46 I don’t get the feeling many of them own stocks.
766 2018-12-23 15:24:35 Banning bump stocks won't eliminate gun violence either so why try, right?

772 2018-12-23 15:21:57 There’s been a lot of boating accidents out there in the last week. Bump stocks and 11+magazines have been disappearing by the millions
773 2018-12-23 15:21:30 So wrong. The move to raise interest rates is to give the Fed at least some ammo when the tariffs, the tax reform that resulted in companies propping up their own stocks and other misguided economic policies lead to a recession that makes 1929 seem like a walk in the park.
774 2018-12-23 15:21:16 "Never more important to cut your losses quickly in this market, there’s no support for poor stocks" - Correct

Equally as important is knowing when to get out of the stocks that are doing good.

Its oh too easy to watch a portfolio rise & rise, get greedy & boom profits lost.
775 2018-12-23 15:20:20 VIX = 40, later dead-cat bounce in stocks so VIX will be crashed for a retest to 24 and financial crisis melt-down VIX to the stratosphere.
776 2018-12-23 15:19:54 Stocks? I doubt it. Trumpers like to collect coins & gold per Fox News
777 2018-12-23 15:19:42 Buy stocks not fries
778 2018-12-23 15:19:20 We have NO inflation, yet the Fed keeps raising rates causing the Market to tank over and over again.  What gives?  Every time they raise rates the stocks lose huge amounts and it becomes harder and harder to sustain our national debt.

781 2018-12-23 15:17:17 For investors who'd been searching for income the past 10 years, now's your chance. Don't look to bonds. There are plenty of 4-7% dividend stocks with rising income streams to choose from. #StockMarket
782 2018-12-23 15:17:08 Fed has rate of change of rates wrong, stocks run up but then have to grow into valuations but shrinking money supply before velocity picks up is a mistake, the idea is economic growth must exceed the hole govt filled during financial crisis.

792 2018-12-23 15:11:04 He must have had a lot of stocks he sold short!
793 2018-12-23 15:09:59 If your parents have investments in stocks, then they've lost a lot of money potential money. Most/all of that should spring back once the government is running again, so this  should be a short-term thing.
794 2018-12-23 15:09:12 Time to buy EM stocks and bonds. $DEM and $ELD
795 2018-12-23 15:08:17 countries unable to deal with full employment because there’s not enough gold in the vaults. It creates more unsustainable debts and deficits for the countries who are net importers. Otherwise governments need to strictly control the international stocks and flows
796 2018-12-23 15:08:13 If there is less faith in that company, then the value of the stocks will fall. A government shutdown effects that.

Stocks are also not worth real money. They're more like *potential money*. Real money is only exchanged when stocks are bought or sold.

801 2018-12-23 15:05:25 Stocks represent ownership in a company. If, say, you own 5 Disney stocks, then you a fraction of the Disney company.

The value of those stocks is based on the worth of the company - its size, revenue, expected growth rate, and a bunch of other factors.

810 2018-12-23 14:58:27 I'd be OK with index funds, but this is a good idea to limit owership for individual stocks.
811 2018-12-23 14:58:07 With @realDonaldtRUmp's #GovernmentShutdown & fiscal mismanagement, he has managed to screw government workers & people who depend on them as well as his donors who own stocks are and just watching their portfolios shrink with every passing day. That takes real talent.

844 2018-12-23 14:40:13 I generally hate trading OTC stocks. I think LQMT is an exception to that for the reasons I've stated. I will continue to hold long-term. So to answer your question, funds don't trade OTC so a market collapse should impact it much.
845 2018-12-23 14:38:51 It's hard now since most of the stocks are already down 30%.  Buying puts is not going to help either because of the high volatility premium.  Most of the investors are in wait and watch mode and desperately hoping for a bounce back in the markets.

850 2018-12-23 14:36:55 Not that Hogg actually did that, but a ban on bump stocks will save exactly “0” people and will stop the same number of shootings.

869 2018-12-23 14:30:38 MO RLC believes in the right to self defense. We support responsible gun ownership. You're question is boundless. Why does anybody need anything? Because it is our human right. A person can bump a gun without the stock. Are cars "necessary"? They kill way more than bump stocks.
870 2018-12-23 14:30:14 Need to explain programmatic ads to your Mom? It's like the stock market, except ad impressions are traded instead of stocks.
871 2018-12-23 14:29:50 If you record stocks, you mean the worst December since 1938, you’re right!  Adding to trumps lies isn’t working anymore
872 2018-12-23 14:29:42 Freeze their accounts, and force them to sell off of any stocks they own.
873 2018-12-23 14:29:32 I've looked at it and the bottom line, is we need to protect fish stocks, which we didn't do before the CFP. The CFP needs reform for sure, but fish stocks have increased since its implementation.
874 2018-12-23 14:28:27 Many live stocks also died..
875 2018-12-23 14:27:16 MAY LUMPIA KAMING STOCKS WOOOOOH AYOS TOOO!!!
876 2018-12-23 14:27:12 @MadMoneyOnCNBC  is the market running into a US debt/GDP problem that we cannot remedy without a major recession? Is this the biggest risk to stocks right now or are my fears overblown?
877 2018-12-23 14:26:55 Ceo ke paas bhi good percentage me Stocks honge na?
878 2018-12-23 14:25:49 Mad Maxine is STUPID, she is no economist.  She only knows how to TAKE Money and SPEND us nto more DEBT!  Now wonder, Stocks plunging and it will get worse.
879 2018-12-23 14:24:04 Oy shet may bagong stocks yung dbtk sa marquee
880 2018-12-23 14:23:03 And I suppose he may have help get government to ban bump stocks... touché, you win this one.  #bumpstocks
881 2018-12-23 14:22:45 Holdings in stocks are tangible and can be traced back to the reporter if not declared.
How do you do that with conflict of interest?
882 2018-12-23 14:22:40 Car chez intel le 9700k mouais bon, le 9900k c'est cher et tu peux faire une raclette et le 8700k c'est le mieux mais les stocks sont rares et c'est 450/500 euros au lieu des 380
883 2018-12-23 14:21:41 You have the right perception. I go back to Buffett and Lynch who have a target of DJIA 50000. When Lynch told me there would be a 10000 Dow all thought he was nuts, pros laughed. I listened and put every dime I could find on the street into value and growth stocks.
884 2018-12-23 14:21:33 ...and armed citizens unlimited (no plastic ban, aka bump stocks)
885 2018-12-23 14:21:22 what makes people think that vix is accurate these days ? I see a lot of distortion in the market action here! Market dropping the way it has in this short period.. on the basis of headline and vix is not higher... how about consideration of  underlying fundamentals of stocks?
886 2018-12-23 14:21:05 also, will you ever trade crypto or will you always do stocks? I feel like youd' prob stick w what you have perfected but just curious
887 2018-12-23 14:20:28 Time @IndEditorsGuild issued advisory to members to disclose political & business interests. Business journalists who rate stocks mandatorily disclose their holdings in those scrips. Conflicts of interest of journos in @ndtv, @republic, @CNNnews18, etc, too must be disclosed
888 2018-12-23 14:19:51 isabelle in wol: inconsolable with emotions, fights her hardest, cannot stand to see everyone in pain
isabelle post wol: takes stocks with no remorse, feels one emotion during battle only and it is salt
889 2018-12-23 14:19:11 I'm gonna post the watchlist for the next week but in general my plan is to be long stocks for the rebound thinking that we are kind of oversold here and we need some retracement to the upside, most focus on sectors ETF that suffered the most this sell off and the growth names
890 2018-12-23 14:19:08 I've always thought how could they not be rigging the stocks? There has to be a better way
891 2018-12-23 14:19:03 Well my stocks are going to shit.... Thanks Trump
892 2018-12-23 14:18:46 Tough to move big stocks as just 1% might involve 1500-1600 cr! 

A smaller stock u can easily manipulate with just 1cr & some leverage. 

Watch delivery % after big moves in many stocks & u will be SHOCKED!
893 2018-12-23 14:17:31 As it should if he does that.  The one good thing that would happen if he did and the stocks tanked is that congress would finally get rid of him.  Either impeachment or under the 25th Amendment.  Once he hits their pocketbook, all bets are off.
894 2018-12-23 14:17:17 all for the rich.1.5t in more debt,where are the pay raises?they did what they said they would do,BUY BACK stocks.look what that has gotten us. 4k drop in stock prices.we are heading into another recession.thanks to trump and the right.
895 2018-12-23 14:16:44 No bro this is not like stocks to trade this is far away better it is an AI and  you can link one broker for automatic trading with HOLLY only with interactive brokers
896 2018-12-23 14:16:28 Thank you,#45!  The government is closed because you had a temper tantrum over a wall. My stocks are down 18% in one month.  Own it like you owned the gains, bird-brain!  And my apologies to birds. #45BirdBrain #ApologiesToBirds

898 2018-12-23 14:15:59 Best & worst stocks of 2018 for AG's compilation of treasures and duds:
Best - ZOO: sold a bit early, looking forward to buying back in when performance catches up with share price
Worst - EYE: dropped 53% ytd but prospects still look good. Best for 2019 or 2020?
899 2018-12-23 14:15:54 Might fuck around and buy some stocks after black friday
900 2018-12-23 14:14:20 Stocks tanked?  All that means is that they are on SALE!  I will never understand the short sightedness of this view... the market has literally recovered every single time that it has dropped.  If you got greedy and bet big on single stocks, that’s on you.
901 2018-12-23 14:11:16 Leveraged trading is a form of liquidity, which in turn have a stabilizing effect on price. Compare volatility of stocks with options contracts v those without or prices on commodities that have a futures market v those without.
902 2018-12-23 14:09:18 It looked inevitable that $aapl would reform but 3 of 4 stocks follow the market and aapl was facing a lawsuit, had bad news on ipad, iphone going down on production, and others really hurt; more importantly, I broke rule #1 to cut losses quick when prev. support in April broke.
903 2018-12-23 14:09:18 Stock markets are EXTREMELY hard on the human psyche! 

Humans look for patterns & certainty & stocks markets are anything but these 2.

U will struggle if u CAN'T embrace the chaos! 

#musings
904 2018-12-23 14:08:50 Blah Blah Blah.
You know:
We are in the #TrumpShutdown 

Every identity your name is involved in is under investigation 

Now Defense Sec, Chief of Staff or Atty General

Our allies hate us

Putin loves you

Stocks tanking

You are doing so good Trump.
Best President is US ever
905 2018-12-23 14:07:08 peruse, 丹念に調べる You'll peruse a small area because the store stocks only sample items. 2018L1 #実践ビジネス英語
906 2018-12-23 14:06:30 It's going pretty good.
I got a pay raise.
My insurance premiums didn't increase for the first time in years.
I'm off for Christmas break, no layoff for me.
My weed stocks have been trash ever since the old AG threatened dispensaries

All in all, could've been better, but not bad
907 2018-12-23 14:05:48 @jimcramer is the market running into a US debt/GDP problem that we cannot remedy without a major recession? Is this the biggest risk to stocks right now?
908 2018-12-23 14:04:07 Wait,what's up with the stocks?
909 2018-12-23 14:03:16 yes, at the same time, probably today's market is offering the great opportunity to buy stocks for future big gains ... the best strategy is to buy tiny shares on down days .. add super slowly.
910 2018-12-23 14:00:59 Over an hour?! How many stocks did you guys have???
911 2018-12-23 14:00:46 I appreciated the ability to regain marketed stocks, now that I own my company again I can tell the SEC n IRS to suck lemon.
Further I was able to hire for the first time in 9 years with confidence.
Some of us do care for our employee's well being!

Profit is not a dirty word!
912 2018-12-23 14:00:06 But can you just give us our machine guns and suppressors and bump stocks and all the other things you the @NRA has had taken away from us?
913 2018-12-23 13:57:20 Yes sold most of he stocks last week.
914 2018-12-23 13:56:47 On the Reading to Penzance @GWRHelp train and the  buffet guy has just announced (as we leave Reading) very limited stocks. There’s going to be some very hungry and thirsty people arriving in Cornwall later.
915 2018-12-23 13:56:11 The buy back The last 1. 57k where supposed were repoted handed to be destroyed. but 30k+ were taking in for rego, 4k for sale & of the other 23k to be destroyed besides firearms included were. nerf guns , magz, bolts,,stocks. barrels, etc, noy
916 2018-12-23 13:55:58 No

917 2018-12-23 13:55:38 That doesn't look right. Stocks didn't start dropping until Dems got elected.
918 2018-12-23 13:54:46 First, will pay off all my debts, invest in stocks & businesses, sponsor the less fortunate students to school and charity works.
919 2018-12-23 13:54:26 Remember when D&G disrespected the Orientals and they all banned together boycotted, and lowered they’re stocks dramatically in a couple days time.. Tommy Hilfiger blatantly claims he doesn’t like black people years ago and WE STILL BUY IT TO THIS DAY Kuz it’s high end fashion
920 2018-12-23 13:54:24 may stocks na kaya ulit silaa
921 2018-12-23 13:53:52 A bear market is a value investors best friend

Most stocks trade near or below the intrinsic value.
Stocks are in no hurry to go up
Most investors dont want to invest coz they fear the stocks will further go down.

These are the best times to invest....for the next bull market!
922 2018-12-23 13:53:29 When you allow crooks to get away with everything because “the economy is great” because you have stocks, nothing else matters until those stocks value at nothing
923 2018-12-23 13:52:46 @realDonaldTrump So much winning!  - All three major indexes are down more than 12% in December. Stocks are on pace for the worst December since the Great Depression -
924 2018-12-23 13:51:31 Hello its not even 10pm yet but ive already tucked myself in bed i am just dead tired, but i'll take pics of my loot and gifts tomorrow!! Also i'll count stocks, if there are enough i'll open my store again for a week in january 
925 2018-12-23 13:50:56 Stocks plummeting, tens of thousands of jobs lost to unnecessary and stupid trade wars, healthcare premiums exploded, Trump named as an un-indicted co-conspirator in a host of felony crimes, no wall and the government is now shut down. What a year. #MAGA!
926 2018-12-23 13:50:46 I'm gonna trim some of my stocks for tax loss, small minute. Then buy Baidu, weibo, and more baba
927 2018-12-23 13:50:41 Whatever how are your stocks doing?
928 2018-12-23 13:49:56 India is so safe that even an anchors can lie blatantly about some stocks like kotak, Berkshire etc...screw up investors money and still get away as if nothing happened. What else u need????
929 2018-12-23 13:47:27 The market is inevitably going to fall #everydecade. Many #stocks are overvalued anywhere from 50 to 300% within the last 5 years. You're right that the Fed raising interest rates and Trump complaining may make the fall come quicker. But #correlation does not imply #causation
930 2018-12-23 13:46:52 because of the "generals" he didn't start nuke wars. 
You are in it for your military industrial stock portfolio, your big pharma stocks & private prison profits.. + your off shore bank account full of lobbyist dollars.
931 2018-12-23 13:46:45 When and how to start intra day trading 
What home work to do before entering intra day trading 
Which stocks to focus for intra day trading 
Especially for beginners
932 2018-12-23 13:45:24 I personally want to know why you can risk your 401k on otc penny stocks but not new emerging markets....
933 2018-12-23 13:45:08 Nope not how it happened keep dreaming . We dont care about stocks anyway that’s for the rich.
934 2018-12-23 13:44:53 I always thought it was funny every time one of these idiots claimed how well the Stock Market was doing as a sign of Trump being successful. How many stocks do you think his supporters actually own? I’m guessing very little.
935 2018-12-23 13:44:17 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses
936 2018-12-23 13:44:01 Sure was, at least until Obama's momentum ran out and Trump's ridiculous Trade War and tax policy really kicked in. Slowing growth, plunging stocks, stagnant wages and rapid inflation.
937 2018-12-23 13:43:57 Let’s see oil is down, companies are buying back stocks & they received tax breaks from @realDonaldTrump he just announced we are pulling out of   and Syria! 17 years in  and the market doesn’t like it?? The 1% & the WAR MACHINE don’t like it! #NoMoreWar Can all fed chairs!
938 2018-12-23 13:42:35 Any interest in giving a reason(s) why bump stocks are necessary to your life? Just curious. Thanks.
939 2018-12-23 13:41:59 While stocks last I presume. Good luck finding sain cause in there was crack yesterday
940 2018-12-23 13:41:28 Let’s see oil is down, companies are buying back stocks & they received tax breaks from @realDonaldTrump he just announced we are pulling out of   and Syria! 17 years in  and the market doesn’t like it?? The 1% & the WAR MACHINE don’t like it! #NoMoreWar #WakeUpAmerica

942 2018-12-23 13:37:37 I’d buy more Uranium stocks....the fundamentals are nearly perfect, as Rick Rule says it’s not IF but WHEN...#bullrun #uranium
943 2018-12-23 13:37:27 Who cares CEO are all about money and stocks. they will sell their souls and even their family down the drain. President Trump is about the American Citizens and our security BIG DIFFERENCE.
America first.
944 2018-12-23 13:36:33 BTW, where are bump stocks and high capacity magazines mentioned in the Bill of Rights??  Oh, yeah, right next to RPG's...  Sorry.
945 2018-12-23 13:35:42 My sister thought Daylight Savings Time was a family thing when they were 4 or 5.
I thought stocks were natural, & didn’t figure out until I was 6 that they could be bought & sold. 
946 2018-12-23 13:35:24 But penny stocks give max CAGR.
947 2018-12-23 13:34:20 If you own stocks you should be happy for a buyback which increases the value of your shares. Markets don’t rise forever. Perhaps if you can’t stomach corrections, perhaps you should have a more conservative investment philosophy.
948 2018-12-23 13:33:12 It's true that surging stocks could actually just be a bunch of crap. But I get your point.
949 2018-12-23 13:31:19 Nuko! e no mebyasang mamilang stocks naman. patse alayu ing CSR karin la mangulung kumang stocks 
950 2018-12-23 13:31:13 PSA about bump stocks from a guy who uses firearms but dosent masturbate with his guns...

It's essentially a springy stock that bounces around so you can use the movement of the gun to shoot almost as fast as an automatic rifle....
951 2018-12-23 13:30:54 But thank god we got those billionaire tax cuts. I don’t know abt you but I’d rather hard working Americans could eat than fat cats buy back stocks.  @realDonaldTrump
952 2018-12-23 13:30:20 Bonjour @TeamVitality je suis allé sur le shop mais les maillots n'apparaissent même plus. Problème sur le site même ou c'est volontaire selon les stocks ?
953 2018-12-23 13:29:53 Our supplier won’t take orders for ABV3. Hindi po kasi siya bumibili sa website. She has her supplier din na wholesale We’re still looking for suppliers na FAST ETA and maraming stocks.
954 2018-12-23 13:27:16 Real World confessional booth style, although I have to say good job on bump stocks and prisoner reform.
955 2018-12-23 13:25:37 Inflation up, interest rate hikes, stocks over-valued and major market corrections on the way, depression looming. All of theses were foreseeable consequences of pouring cash into an already booming economy.

959 2018-12-23 13:23:56 Simple advice for people NEW to markets -

# start #Investing in ETFs/Mfs

# experiment with 5% of your money in direct stocks & increase the allocation to the DIY portfolio only if u can track or beat the #nifty 

# if consistently beating the nifty, keep increasing DIY PF by 5%
960 2018-12-23 13:21:39 Majority of people dont know anything apart from real estate and loan sharking :) They will keep doing the same till system breaks down. The time has come for real estate I think. Probably after that they will move to stocks.
961 2018-12-23 13:20:24 Paying for a redundant wall, government shutdown, troop withdrawal, plummeting stocks, resignations, investigations. This is the unmaking of everything that makes America great. #maga #wall #nobannowall #governmentshutdown #america
962 2018-12-23 13:17:41 If political parties are traded in exchanges,

BJP - Multibagger. Stay long.
CONG - Technically looking weak. Further downside expected. Stay short.
AAP - Penny stock. No fundamentals. Don't trade.
CPI/CPM - Penny stocks. Will be delisted soon. No volume.

964 2018-12-23 13:15:59 I just love her breathlessness all the time. Over the little things.  Say Christmas. Calm and cool over stocks failing, world becoming more dangerous, climate hurting, FEMA incompetence, markets teetering, collusion, nepotism, general incompetence, fake border crisis, stupid wall
965 2018-12-23 13:15:07 Woah, I thought you only have limited stocks of that. Pero thanks oppa!
966 2018-12-23 13:15:03 Stocks entering “bear market” territory, triggered by trade tension, interest rate hike and govt. shutdown. Will have a ripple effect globally. What does this mean for climat finance? Fix the roof while sun is still shining (literally)!
967 2018-12-23 13:14:51 Can’t wait for the American stocks to be listed...

971 2018-12-23 13:13:06 Good luck getting hold of Gravalax. And camembert stocks are low.
972 2018-12-23 13:12:36 ly answer has more stocks in sm stores than albums of their own artists, this is so sad
973 2018-12-23 13:11:41 well my stocks lost so many points, I am affected very much in my life. But others have never!!  had that opportunity  to  live decently !
974 2018-12-23 13:11:34 A reasonable approach could be a wipeout of current stock owners and replacing them with the creditors/customers of banks. Sounds harsh, but stock investors took a entrepreneurial risk by buying stocks.
975 2018-12-23 13:09:28 #Zimbabwe up +45% YTD ! ! oooo mugabe left 
#stocks #africa
976 2018-12-23 13:08:28 Ok thanks. I am trying to understand whether 'btfd' would be the best strategy for stock investors or has something changed massively. I dont invest in stocks as such. Just trying to understand markets. Will give gerald a follow.
977 2018-12-23 13:06:26 Nothing altruistic in what you. If shorting stocks was banned you people would not give two shits about "corporate malfeasance"....
978 2018-12-23 13:05:25 You know who else is down 20% (or more) since spring 2018?

$AMZN
$FB
$TWTR
$NVDA

I don't think it has much to do with direct listing. All tech stocks are in bear territory.
979 2018-12-23 13:04:56 Typical bear market behavior.  What’s the market going to rally over????   I fear stocks will continue to fall until “fair value” is found. What fair value is in this environment is the trillion dollar question...
980 2018-12-23 13:03:55 Here comes the @realDonaldTrump Slump:
+ Worst week in stocks since financial crisis of 2008
+ Worst December since the Great Depression
+ Tariff Man’s policies hurting industry and global trade
+ Government shutdown

981 2018-12-23 13:03:46 Expert pesion fund managers are paying top price for UK stocks - they expect a good future, but hey, you have numpty forecasts that are endlessly proven wrong
982 2018-12-23 13:03:09 History teaches us when the 2 and 10 Yrs bond yield inverses we still have a 1-2 year strong stockmarket till a recession kicks in. And the inversion is not even fully happening #stocks #investing

984 2018-12-23 12:58:29 What do you mean you can't pick and choose where to stick your thermometer?  You just did with your examples- San Fran real estate and financialization (stocks, bonds, etc...).  ...
985 2018-12-23 12:56:57 @Penny_Stockin  greetings; I have about 30 penny stocks ranging from various industries. Need to know how to properly access which ones to keep of simply let go.
986 2018-12-23 12:54:41 Till stocks last lang. Huhuhuhu. Hopefully they'll come back. VT Cosmetics is also in Rob ermita. 
987 2018-12-23 12:54:36 But probably don’t have stocks or 401K to be concerned about
988 2018-12-23 12:54:31 mfw Trump ends 2 useless wars but also bans bump stocks and throws a fit over the border wall in the same week

990 2018-12-23 12:52:55 Have you actually read any of those articles returned by "the Google"? If u had, u would realize whatever has been enacted has zero to do with Hogg n Co, and is largely unenforceable symbolic BS. Example: bump stocks. Thats bc of Vegas shooter, n the legislation stops nothing.
991 2018-12-23 12:52:41 In fairness, it is not just the media. What percentage of stocks have “sell” or “underperform” ratings across the street?

993 2018-12-23 12:52:32 Has there been a “bubble” caused by super low interest rates and investors piling into hot “growth” stocks? For sure! But the stock market is still an index made up of INDIVIDUAL stocks! There are REALLY good (cheap) companies out there! $SPY
994 2018-12-23 12:52:31 Similarly many working people don’t realize members of Congress are most interested in  lower taxes on investment income like stocks and property. Because unlike the rest of us, that’s where their wealth is. Thank you for speaking for the rest of us.
995 2018-12-23 12:52:08 Don't you mean a wealth tax? This really sounds like a situation where we should tax stocks, not flows.
996 2018-12-23 12:51:33 You got it.

Gold can certainly drop in a real '08-style panic as people unload everything in their portfolios to come up with dollars. I was just disputing the statement that gold goes down with stocks. 

But I'd be surprised if gold didn't outperform cash and stocks in 3 mos.
997 2018-12-23 12:51:06 Hawaii wants to ban police officers from visiting and carrying their weapons while on the island. Yep, keep trying to take away our guns. First it was the magazine ban, now bump stocks, now its time to attack police who carry.
998 2018-12-23 12:50:33 I find it kinda scary that we’re now in a place where simply owning stocks is seen as morally questionable
999 2018-12-23 12:50:10 I think you should have enough money for your wall now, taking in consideration the plummeting of stocks in retirement plans alone. I, unlike you can not afford these losses for your grandiose schemes. Don't make us pawns in your game. Make America Great Again! #TrumpResign
1000 2018-12-23 12:49:34 I agree. I identified 12 stocks this weekend that I find very attractive. Will they fall further? Who knows? But are they worth substantially more than current prices IMHO? Yes. So buy and hold, I still believe that approach works.

1037 2018-12-23 12:19:22 You neglected to mention that the Fed is reducing its $4 trillion balance sheet and this is pushing up interest rates (which puts downward pressure on stocks) and increases market volatility (which triggers large machine trading and panics small investors into selling).

1058 2018-12-23 11:56:14 Yes that's the MAIN fear. 

US markets in a tailspin. Will have to see how big & long the correction there is. Currently it doesn't look alarming. Just a reversion to mean of extremely overbought stocks, like the FAANG.

1067 2018-12-23 11:40:12 It was in 2017 and euphoria happened during jan 2018. We entered correction phase in feb and may be topped in august. Look at charts of dec 2017 & jan 2018. The rise across stocks was as if there ll be no tomorrow. But during that phase small cap & mid cap stocks were hammered.

1114 2018-12-23 10:35:33 Coz ultimately these stocks give 3x,5x,10x returns..On the contrary, Buying in falling stocks is no guarantee that they will rise again coz fundamentals which are Rosy may deteriorate subsequently. There is a reason Stock Price & Market is called Leading Indicator.

I have 13 years of data for 60 odd stocks don’t want to commit if it will cause performance issues on XIRR Calcs?

1124 2018-12-23 10:25:35 Ummm not mine. I got a huge raise. I have nothing in stocks so I do not give a shit. I bring home more money since Trump has been in office than Obama the last 8 years. I am doing great. Thanks for asking
1125 2018-12-23 10:21:12 Stocks are more volatile than index....on bad day stock can move up/down by 5% ....might not have the same problem with index
1126 2018-12-23 10:18:08 The #DEEPSTATE will do anything it can to destroy America- Including raising interest rates. The stock market is being manipulated by speculators that keep buying stocks when they are low and then selling off when they hit the top.
1127 2018-12-23 10:16:23 Exactly! Read their rationale for raising interest rates! The FED Chair would be FAILED out of business school for that! You know what? We should just BUY MORE STOCKS/MUTUAL FUNDS; prices are lower and WILL go higher. Watch .@realDonaldTrump FIRE FED Chair, Jerome Powell! #MAGA
1128 2018-12-23 10:15:49 “Negotiations for a no deal Brexit”? With whom? No deal means no bilateral agreement. As for readiness measures, sure. The gov’t has leased thousands of cubic metres of fridges, freezers, warehousing, to ensure emergency stocks of medicine and food. Is that what people voted for?
1129 2018-12-23 10:15:41 In my view we have not yet reached capitulation for SWN and RRC. It is better to wait until these stocks have bottomed. I am still shorting.
1130 2018-12-23 10:15:14 I’m in New Zealand, am retired and every day I watch my retirement savings in stocks and shares slide down, down, down... You are correct when you say that everything Trump does, affects the rest of the World.
1131 2018-12-23 10:14:35 @Effreeeel twas nice bumpin' into guys kanina. Hahaha!  Hassle ubos ang panda stocks. Kahit dito sa Cyber Mall. Kinginang yan.
1132 2018-12-23 10:11:12 #China to implement a negative list mgt system for #ForeignFirms who will receive pre-established national treatment and have equal rights to participate in activities incl issuing stocks and govt procurement, shows a draft law released by the top legislative body on Sun.
1133 2018-12-23 10:10:28 #XRPcommunity #XRP The reality is  it's coming. Stocks usually rally in December, they're plummeting. The powerful are not ready to maximize their position. The safest place over the next few months cash or metals. when the start flags raised be prepared. The greedy are ravenous.
1134 2018-12-23 10:10:22 Unless an end-of-year rally emerges, 2018 will be the worst year for U.S. stocks since 2008 and the S&P 500 on track for its worst December since the Great Depression.
1135 2018-12-23 10:09:44 $NKE was in a massive uptrend long before @Kaepernick7. The stock is now in a huge downtrend headed back to $50 and caught a breather last week on ER. You know nothing about stocks.
1136 2018-12-23 10:07:12 I wouldn't be surprised if stocks lasted a while 
1137 2018-12-23 10:05:57 generally when Nifty50 stocks go sideways, Midcap gets the favor !
1138 2018-12-23 10:04:56 These things always take longer to move than we think. Uranium stocks are stocks and will go down in a general market downturn. The uranium story gets moving after spot price gets a three handle and 232 gets resolved.
1139 2018-12-23 10:04:00 Old economy stocks haven't really moved in 15 years. US has nearly quadrupled.
1140 2018-12-23 10:00:22 Wonder if the author is talking specifically about US market or in general all global markets? I doubt if we have clean data for Indian stocks to make blanket statements like these with so many accounting subjectivity involved in value(quant) strategies
1141 2018-12-23 10:00:11 Economic growth is not inflation. 

Cherry picking data is not evidence of inflation. 

The only real place we have seen REAL inflation is in asset prices stocks, bonds and debt TO GDP. 

That is a direct correlation that deficits serve the top 1%. Hierarchy of money flows.

1144 2018-12-23 09:57:41 All about commerce now. January sales used to be about selling off surplus stocks, some bought in cheap goods or seconds back in the day when margins were sacred. Not it’s all about sales and match8ng discounts, tight margins. Hence struggling and bankruptcies in retailing.
1145 2018-12-23 09:57:22 Funny how the rich leaders of the US and UK seem to be making apparently stupid choices affecting stocks. Wonder where they are making investments knowing the values will go back up again.
1146 2018-12-23 09:57:06 The pharma companies themselves are diverting stocks into reserves. 
Thats why theyre not being sent to the pharmacies.

1164 2018-12-23 09:39:01 No problem, I'll be doing more and more vids. Crypto is like stocks on crack -- a mix of perfect 'crowd psychology' movements mixed with random unexpected wale movements take advantage of it.
1165 2018-12-23 09:38:38 when I think of all those old whiskies I drank in the 90s! All the old stocks were sold off to the oligarchs. What passes for posh whisky now is largely spin - young whisky with dressings. What old whisky exists is massively dear or fake.

1167 2018-12-23 09:34:58 Iceland and Norway have great stocks of Cod. Cod swim where they wish. Sometimes they swim north sometimes south. I have been told that more cod have been swimming  South recently.
1168 2018-12-23 09:34:16 Our fish stocks have been decimated by the EU, you just have to look at the records. We need to take them back under our control, and protect them to ensure regeneration, for OUR future.
1169 2018-12-23 09:33:22 Sadly, buying stocks in this rigged market is what's making us net poorer no matter how relatively richer we become. The best thing we can now do is buy free-market money and hold it. Collapse the system and trade anew.

1178 2018-12-23 09:24:40 funny how Iceland and Norway have great stocks of Cod - while ours have been depleted - it wouldn't have anything to do with the fact that we are in the CFP run by EU would it
1179 2018-12-23 09:23:16 I dumped all my stocks couple of months back. With his ego, It was obvious after midterm election this shit show will only get worse in 2019. Imo bitcoin performance will surprise everyone.
1180 2018-12-23 09:23:14 I employ buy the dip strategy. So far it worked amazingly well. Currently there is a big dip in the market, therefore big apportunity to buy stocks like NVDA with discount.

1186 2018-12-23 09:11:15 With money in the talk, that man will do ANYTHING; and apparently so will you. We all see the rise and drop in stocks that his family who runs his businesses (conflict of interest), buy when he puts tariffs then SWIMS in cash when he lifts them. Teach your kids BETTER. Shameful.

1219 2018-12-23 08:35:53 Investment strategy for long termer..
Choose few stocks from highly efficient, honest n reputed group with good business model.
Deep study about their fundamental, intrinsic value and future outlook.
Watch movement of stock n BETA.
Grab it when sentiments goes highly bearish.

1225 2018-12-23 08:18:02 Business advice is often total crap, but what I do know is that don't play the penny stocks..
1226 2018-12-23 08:16:06 The top 10 percent of Americans owned an average of $969,000 in stocks. The next 40 percent owned $132,000 on average. For the bottom half of families, it was just under $54,000. I would assume that’s from savings.
1227 2018-12-23 08:15:09 According to the Federal Reserve, of the 10 percent of families with the highest income, 92 percent owned stocks as of 2013 (latest year for their study), the same level of ownership back in 2007. But ownership slipped for people in the bottom half of the income distribution.
1228 2018-12-23 08:13:37 So if I sell a few bump stocks inside the Yellow Rose will the Travis County District Attorney’s office prosecute me? Asking for a friend. What if I choke my bump stock? Still asking for a friend. What if I hit my bump stock but I don't bruise it, can I be prosecuted?

1236 2018-12-23 08:07:47 Who is they?  The media doesn’t care. The media just reports news and when news is bad, stocks are low. When news is good it’s high. That’s why it’s so difficult psychologically to buy when things are low because normal instincts would tell you otherwise. But glad you’re buying..

1249 2018-12-23 07:57:23 Because Donald Trump waved his magic wand and made the economy better again! The stocks are as bad as they were during the Great Depression, wages have only grown by about 1.2% which is not enough to get people out of the hole they were in in the recession, but it's better!

1258 2018-12-23 07:45:04 No; #stocks have been crashing for recent weeks - as the investing class belatedly started realizing that soaring stocks while the visible economy looked like one burger joint after next was an obvious bubble and started getting out if belatedly.

1262 2018-12-23 07:42:41 Inaccurate.
Markets are collapsing anyway in recent weeks; investors belatedly realized that soaring #stocks of recent years - while incomes near-flat and a large and increasing percent of currently working incomes nil - is a bubble sharing pattern of housing bubble.

1266 2018-12-23 07:38:44 I thought we were in a bull market for uranium but instead we are in a bear market. Most Uranium stocks declined by 20% in the last 3 months which is the definition of a bear market (10% = correction). The bull market preceding the crash was very short. Lets hope next bull lasts.

1319 2018-12-23 06:41:46 The stock market is up 600% since the mid-90’s. 

Fees and commissions are in the neighborhood of 1% a year.

Neither of those has anything to do with Stoller’s idiotic claim that stocks are owned only by the wealthy and thus the ACA was designed to further enrich them.

1340 2018-12-23 06:20:26 No they're not. 15% of ppl own 85% of stocks. They barely dent the impact of demand, esp in the case of a tight labor market and expansive fiscal policy.

Fed keeping rates too low for longer will continue to let Congress behave recklessly w/fiscal policy.

1347 2018-12-23 06:13:13 He didn’t say it was a lie. It’s clearly a misrepresentation of the economy based on a bad month for stocks and a layoff that has more to do with poor management than the economy. Whatever your political leanings you must know Adam Schiff is a joke right?

1354 2018-12-23 06:08:40 That’s all on the Fed. If you look at the valuations of stocks, they’re extremely oversold. During Obama’s 8 years, the Fed’s monetary policy artificially inflated them, and put them in an extremely overbought status.

1360 2018-12-23 06:00:46 Why is there so much hate towards our wonderful President? 

I don’t care that stocks are down, people need to work instead of staying home and clicking buttons,

 I don’t care that troops are coming home, home is better than battlefield

Stop spamming hate! #MAGA
1361 2018-12-23 06:00:15 better than any Tax increase the Left will give.  

P.S. learn to econ.  
1.  The Dow and GM have more to do with stupid tariffs (and the Fed for the Dow)
2.  How can stock buy backs AND the Dow being down BOTH be bad for the mid-class.  Do they own stocks or not?  Idiot

So seems like worst is over. Next move started.

1369 2018-12-23 05:49:47 People who think Trump firing the Fed Chair would boost stocks are kidding themselves. Alarm at the prospect of serious institutional instability - especially in the context of everything else going on - would far outweigh the prospect of rates being kept low.

1373 2018-12-23 05:47:23 "Trump has faulted the Fed for the market slide. But on Wall Street, many say his actions are also to blame."

1380 2018-12-23 05:44:23 Stocks drop due to Democrats passing law that allows companies to buy their own stock to drive up prices!

1386 2018-12-23 05:40:00 We will continue to see this happen: Stocks dumping while crypto pumps.

1388 2018-12-23 05:36:17 Lol, I had the same idea as you about gta and stocks.  In my high school econ class, we did a project where everyone had  to invest fake money in the stock market.  It was around the time San Andreas came out, so my group decided to invest in Rockstar, not TakeTwo.
1389 2018-12-23 05:35:48 Oh so close yet so far away how far does have to go to get a cray down there lenna are stocks waining
1390 2018-12-23 05:35:18 Looking at Dow and S&P500 charts, fairly sure we will see Dow at sub 19000 ( 18000 range ) and S&P500  at 2100 levels over Fall /End 2019.
We will have however a major bounce into April /May 2019 in USA mkts

1402 2018-12-23 05:29:05 Well I guess bump-stocks & booty shorts are out, huh? 

Seriously though, how about something like an #Audible subscription?  Learning & entertainment in one package. You can make it fun by helping them pick interesting books to "read".
1403 2018-12-23 05:26:46 Yeah, we'll go with that. How's your stocks doing about now?  

Just how big did that deficit grow in the lat 2 years.  Seems to me that since the R's control it all, logic would say it's their fault, right?
1404 2018-12-23 05:26:38 I am 19. I live in Cary, North Carolina, If I won the million I would give my tithes in church then pay off all my parents debt. And invest in stocks and put some in savings and last but not least give to people who are less fortunate!
1405 2018-12-23 05:26:06 @ASOS I have 20 order shipped at Dec 11, 2018 , but no one have received.
some of those are out of stocks. but why you can shipped  if no stock?

1407 2018-12-23 05:23:56 If I made millions trading stocks or bitcoins, I’d be in a hammock on my island, with my thong wearing poolboy bringing me a never ending supply of Pina Coladas.
1408 2018-12-23 05:23:26 Calm down.  Powell is fine.  Markets don’t go straight up forever.  Corrections are often as violent going down as speculation fuels bulls.  Look at the wild trades going on just a few months ago.  Soo many  $ stocks.  Stock markets often predict recessions that don’t happen!
1409 2018-12-23 05:23:10 I doubt any of the CBD Hemp stocks will sky rocket like $NHPI will or whatever the ticker will be called, because it’s going to run hard. I did front load on most of the CBD positions and have taken profits, but I’m looking for more from those positions. To each his own.

1411 2018-12-23 05:20:59 Can you please publish "Pushti"chemical contamination report in karnataka and stop sale of expired stocks for profit by your government officials in anganwadis? Thus you will be doing great service to lives of children eating expired "Pushti".
1412 2018-12-23 05:20:45 There will likely be a recession in late 2019 or 2020. It’s kind of just the ebb and flow of how the economy works. As of now though I’d still say it’s in good shape (at least what I’m reading). Stocks are slumping from interest rate hikes which normally stem from a good economy.
1413 2018-12-23 05:19:56 MTUM absolutely crushed. Will be looking at momentum stocks for quick bounce trades in event of an explosive bear rally. Still watching the $VIX trade. Long volatility may be a good trade for awhile. Don't fight it,  good time to learn it.
1414 2018-12-23 05:18:53 Plausible. Option 2: The entire free world storms the WH and drags his treasonous orange ass out and throws him in stocks on the mall. Next to Tucker Carlson. CNN & MSNBC are in the front row. Live reporting.
1415 2018-12-23 05:18:41 How is he doing a bad job?  Economy is up.  Deficit is in half.  Unemployment at an all time low. Stocks are at a high.

I don’t get the logic

Yeah he says some dumb stuff. But look at facts of what he’s doing. Look at the results

And no Obama has nothing to do with his success

1428 2018-12-23 05:09:14 $NHPI is great yeah for sure but it’s never wise to put all your accounts equity into one position. I have farm Bill stocks and $NHPI because I believe in them all. Also it’s just good risk management imo.

That said, after the GW Bush banking failure of 2007, I have decided to invest heavily in Real Estate. 

After the Trump crash, and the Dems take over it should be Ok, until the GOP deregulation takes over, again.
1445 2018-12-23 04:57:46 Dave.... I hope all your stocks are falling. You're a loser. Probably a Russian bot. You throw insults but have no regard for the truth, so another words, your opinion is zero.
1446 2018-12-23 04:57:09 While the stocks have the worst week in a decade. A DECADE. You do everything to make it worse because  a) you are not good at what you do b) you don’t really care about people’s 401ks or c) both

1456 2018-12-23 04:44:47 Why not propose that tRump and his malicious minions pay for their wall by reclaiming the funds from their oligarch buddies who used the $1.4 trillion tax break to buy back stocks and otherwise enrich themselves instead of stimulating the economy?
1457 2018-12-23 04:44:10 So here is a different take: we were in a precarious place in summer but just didn’t know it. Now stocks are way cheaper so our returns on future investments are going to be a lot better. I’m way more relaxed now to be honest
1458 2018-12-23 04:41:53 Even in its best of days it was slow to counting, nowadays I just dont think it's anything more than a Activision Blizzard stocks plummeting trend of lets not engage.

1464 2018-12-23 04:38:39 Based on the U.S. history of previous market crashes, investors who are currently entirely in stocks could lose as much as 80% of their savings if the 1929 or 2001 crashes repeat. If we have a repeat of the 2008 crash, the loss would be “only” 56%.
1465 2018-12-23 04:37:42 Good grief! What a comment! How long did that take? How many more died? Bump stocks was the very least they could do!
1466 2018-12-23 04:36:59 Gun rights activists insist that bump stocks don’t fall under the federal ban within the text of  law because they do not allow a firearm to fire more than one shot “by a single function of the trigger.” These devices harness a rifle’s recoil energy to make the trigger auto fire

Small position. It’s still lotto but the covering/short squeeze potential is huge. Choose any NASDAQ stocks
1477 2018-12-23 04:27:10 Guess we'll have to see. Much depends on what the Fed does, and tech stocks. But Trump's economic policies are NOT causing a recession. The tariffs aren't on us, we will bring in money from them. So it's wait & see.
1478 2018-12-23 04:26:42 This shut down may bring America to it's knees by stocks continuing to dive into dangerous margins since the great depression, federal employees becoming volunteers overnight against their will, and taxpayer dollars being spent with reservation. Talking it out is the best.
1479 2018-12-23 04:25:32 Hey Pratik! Discounted price on our range is limited till the stocks last. Nonetheless, we offer great deals and discounts quite occasionally. So do keep an eye out for them! ^SU
1480 2018-12-23 04:24:56 Hey Abhi! Discounted price on our range is limited till the stocks last. Nonetheless, we offer great deals and discounts quite occasionally. So do keep an eye out for them! ^SU
1481 2018-12-23 04:24:51 Anyone who sets smash online to 3 stocks and THREE MINUTES need to stop playing the game
1482 2018-12-23 04:24:22 Hey Bhavik! Discounted price on our range is limited till the stocks last. Nonetheless, we offer great deals and discounts quite occasionally. So do keep an eye out for them! ^SU
1483 2018-12-23 04:23:40 My stocks have tanked. Why do the rich elite let this fool continue to play president. They must also be losing buckets of money
1484 2018-12-23 04:23:29 Eros media can be top picks..promoters seems to clean his image on continuous buying from open market.Also releasing his pledge shares also.last quater PAT and margin both highest level in his life.stocks available at very cheap valuation after 70 % fall from its alltime highs.
1485 2018-12-23 04:22:59 And if you are camping me out with Greninja and can kill me at 0 for using my recovery consistently do NOT be surprised when I take that stock for pausing, idc if it was between stocks or not I wanna play that matchup as little as possible
1486 2018-12-23 04:21:19 this is just the beginning, all people who sold stocks this week have fiat available to invest into crypto
1487 2018-12-23 04:20:47 "actually, jeff bezos' wealth isnt literally bags of money in his basement. It's in assets/stocks from the companies he owns and you'd know it's literally impossible to redistribute those if u knew anything about economics"
1488 2018-12-23 04:20:24 Call me crazy, but I think the next bull run will be from what looks like a recession about to start.  I base this on many investors seeking to diversify their holdings, so the more they pull out of stocks, the more goes into crypto.

1493 2018-12-23 04:12:33 So let me get this straight you get a A+ rating from the NRA & within 2 years ban bump stocks over a clear false flag! So much for that A+ rating then again with Mena, AR drug smuggling Oliver North running the NRA I guess that’s what you get. You are a disappointment
1494 2018-12-23 04:11:47 Pres. Trump our stocks are dropping drastically, people are homeless and you want to spend 50 Billion dollars on a wall!!!!.  U stated that Mexico was paying for it now there not..lie.  If u want it that bad use your own $$$  #help PR. Instead....
1495 2018-12-23 04:10:00 Falling stocks are all on him and his stupid tariffs.

1501 2018-12-23 04:04:07 On the other hand, Samsora is a fearless player with unrelenting pressure and constant evolution. He seems to have a sixth sense of unique openings where stocks become available for the taking, not on baits, but psychic like reads. He's weak to momentum from his opponent.
1502 2018-12-23 04:04:03 How much money do you have invested in steel stocks and the construction company hired to build this “wall”.?  Inquiring minds want to know.
1503 2018-12-23 04:03:13 social stocks gonna fall when folks catch on that Round Here is  the platonic ideal of Marinara songs
1504 2018-12-23 04:02:09 Inadvance na ng inadvance ang ordering ng stocks!! Kala ba nila madali mag forecast?! Jusko lerd
1505 2018-12-23 04:01:46 Idk @mrkwilliamson what if Trump's legacy is one of economic success  (stocks,jobs,industry,trade) improving #USA well beyond his 8 years? I really think once #MSM/#Dems hate mongering is out of the pic #trump will look alot different to you and the History Books 

We'll see!
1506 2018-12-23 04:01:38 Hey Dan- would you expand on the economic indicators you mean?
Unemployment and the stock market are the indicators I have seen Republicans talking about the last two years.  Stocks -are- down and wages have been a concern for quite some time.
1507 2018-12-23 03:58:37 Level of Govt manipulation in our financial markets is huge. INR has capital controls while there is no way to short sell small quantities of stocks which causes the market to be long only for retail investors. Not a bjp problem. It's a systemic problem.
1508 2018-12-23 03:58:29 Stocks can’t go up forever can they? In 2013 BB could’ve stop this then, instead he punted and the bubble blew bigger. Yellen was just passing through. Overlay the SPX with the FED balance sheet. It’s all you need to know.
1509 2018-12-23 03:57:21 Successful stock market investing does not need financial acumen as much as mental discipline.

You need courage to buy stocks which are out of favor - and patience to allow them to compound!
1510 2018-12-23 03:57:19 trump created such turmoil stocks worldwide are in free fall.  
Only Barack Obama’s stock is skyrocketing
1511 2018-12-23 03:54:38 The closest thing your getting online is the battlefield rule set in elite smash as most tournaments are agreeing on three stocks and the legality of stages varies as we’re still in the early stages of the game
1512 2018-12-23 03:54:34 Until stocks last ata iirc ^^
1513 2018-12-23 03:54:07 No one wants to watch doom and gloom or deal with the reality that stocks may go down
1514 2018-12-23 03:51:35 And we are richer than ever before. Now our saved money from the top of the Stock market is being used to buy cheap stocks back at low prices. We are going to get even richer.
I do not know who taught you economics, but I sure hope you got out as the rest of us at the top.
1515 2018-12-23 03:51:00 Guy you’re becoming a loser. Maybe if you ditch the politics and focus on markets your returns will improve. At this point investors are better off using a dart board to pick stocks rather than listening to your daily blather. 
1516 2018-12-23 03:50:16 You have to say your favorite because America don't see it like that stocks worst December in 87 years the Trump recession. Is here you did it in only 2 years 6 bankrupts sorry business man what a looser and a crook
1517 2018-12-23 03:50:03 I agree, if there was any justice though he'd be put in wooden stocks for the same period he's been in politics and pelted with rotten fruit. The pariah and saboteur of the nation is his legacy.
1518 2018-12-23 03:47:17 I got my raise. 
Stocks sre down, time to buy more. 
GM has had issues for a while. Obama  pumped them full of government money but they never really changed. Same boring cars produced at substandard quality by the same overpriced union.
1519 2018-12-23 03:46:14 Stocks down roughly 16% since peak in late Sept  When asked about (The above) FEd Powell responded that's (Fed) tightening.” (Res Ipsa Loquitior!) Barrons ibid

1522 2018-12-23 03:42:58 You have your opinion. America is the greatest it ever was right now.
Stock market is the cheapest ever, even the poorest man can buy stocks and get good dividends.
The Democrat horror is over, the People are singing and dancing in the streets, laughing. 
This is a Golden Age.
1523 2018-12-23 03:41:03 Obama had 4 Sec Def's and the economy is doing great...CNBC.. The markets are just  creating a buying opportunity because after moving from 18k to 26k in one year, stocks were overvalued. Next complaint?

1525 2018-12-23 03:39:54 If political parties are traded in exchanges,

BJP - Multibagger. Stay long.
CONG - Technically looking weak. Further downside expected. Stay short.
AAP - Penny stock. No fundamentals. Don't trade.
CPI/CPM - Penny stocks. Will be delisted soon. No volume.

1527 2018-12-23 03:38:29 crowdsourcing is very popular for stocks all over the world Assad :)
1528 2018-12-23 03:37:28 I love Trump. Less taxes, more pay in pocket, soldiers coming home, gas prices down, stocks hit all time high (they are suffering now but will bounce back)... & the crybaby left wing nuts are calling for impeachment STILL, even after he cancels his holiday. #NeverWinWithTheLeft
1529 2018-12-23 03:34:05 lol, systematic collapse? lol. wow, definitely time to buy more stocks.
1530 2018-12-23 03:33:26 Stocks have done amazing, thank you.
1531 2018-12-23 03:33:10 Unlike ðe Dow Jones, ðese stocks can help feed people
1532 2018-12-23 03:33:00 Very low number ..some in 401K's .. Trump touts Stock Market..not me... So lower taxes allowed major buybacks only helps investors..50% of US Stocks owned by non US investors.. Tax cuts designed to help corporations.. They cashed in..did not invest in capital or their people..
1533 2018-12-23 03:31:04 Not sure when. But greed will make retail move away from equity & back to urban real estate & land investment. Reason: Less than honest FMs, AMCs and direction less small and mid cap promoters. 2018 S&M caps are more like 2000 IT stocks. Low chance of reaching previous heights 
1534 2018-12-23 03:29:38 P/E down a lot already so it’s the margins reversion that’s more damaging prospect at this point. GMO thinks margins are inflated by ~50%. If that reverts stocks are screwed. Bulls say Corp power is so great that we’ll have permanently higher margins, ie it’s different this time
1535 2018-12-23 03:29:08 I’m 56.  I first read this as you were buying socks on sale.  My first thought was “What a smart young man taking advantage of a bargain.”  My second was “Where can I find this sale?”

Now I see that you said stocks.  My first thought still holds true.
1536 2018-12-23 03:29:01 All I got to say is TRUMP made bump stocks illegal, that’s infringement upon the second amendment! The only way I’ll be satisfied if he completes the wall % so I won’t have a need for a bump stock!!
1537 2018-12-23 03:28:24 It will bounce as soon as shutdown is sorted. There is a great opportunity to buy stocks with a 2wk horizon
1538 2018-12-23 03:26:53 Take your head out of the ground, the sudden drop in market was CAUSED by SOROS, 3 weeks ago. After Zuckerbergs refusal to sell him FB. Soros,began demoralizing FB, he SOLD ALL HIS MAJOR STOCKS. Another attack on Trump! This caused the plummet.
1539 2018-12-23 03:25:54 Comrade Donald Trump is trying to make it so that people will be able to buy stocks at super low prices, possibly even cheaper than when George Bush was president. Buying stocks right after a stock market crash is one of the easiest ways to build wealth fast.
1540 2018-12-23 03:25:08 Wala manlang stocks ng pagkain dito huhuhu pota di kase nagiwan ng pera e
1541 2018-12-23 03:24:44 Am I doing something wrong!? How come I'm like super close to ppl when I use Jigglypuff's Rest attack and it does jacks**t? Yet we got other ppl using it like foot away and making opponent fly out the ring losing like 3 stocks!? Is there a trick to it!?
1542 2018-12-23 03:23:42 Yep! Some stocks have stayed oversold all the way to ZERO!
1543 2018-12-23 03:23:39 Some of it is but someone is overfishing those oceans to the point of dwindling fish stocks.
1544 2018-12-23 03:22:31 Biggest companies have invested bigly their tax cut in their own stocks. And those are dropping too
1545 2018-12-23 03:20:22 And yet you backed a ban on bump stocks where owners are required to destroy a previously legal item without compensation or become felons.
1546 2018-12-23 03:18:36 Looks like it fell off a cliff in December along with most of the stocks in S&P - similar chart patterns
Maybe high frequency trading is to blame along with Fed?
1547 2018-12-23 03:17:09 Greeks are shit. You can't keep following greeks of so much stocks. It's ever changing, not possible. And anyways many Greeks can be manipulated.
1548 2018-12-23 03:16:48 I agree 100%. I’ve felt for the longest that we needed to rework our trade deals especially with China. My stocks haven’t been happy lately but I know it’s the right direction and it’s a price I’m willing to pay. This will be HUGE for the future of America.
1549 2018-12-23 03:16:21 Stocks are more than likely going to turn into a bear market. Plus theres a strong chance for another recession in the next year or two. I think crypto has finally hit its bottom its gonna fluctuate but the pump is coming everythings super cheap chances for a 100% gains are high
1550 2018-12-23 03:14:34 Yea and banning bump stocks was one of your election promises? SMH. Becoming more of an establishment politician every day. Do what's right! Not what might get you re-elected, because it wont.

1554 2018-12-23 03:11:54 If the calendar year ended 9/20 and stocks were up 7% while bonds were down 2% they probably would have fired me and went back to the broker that had them overweight equity. So much of this job is out of our control.

1556 2018-12-23 03:11:12 Well at least you have one supporter... YOURSELF! You are by far one of the worst! Our stocks are plummeting, we have had 3 shutdowns in a year over your ignorant tantrums and you created a hateful divide in this country! #anyonebuttrumpin2020
1557 2018-12-23 03:10:13 Not really. A lot of stocks are traded or not traded by computers. They crunch numbers. Like, Apple sales being down triggers drops. Stock buy backs are a non story too. There is a million plus C corps that aren't traded on the market.
1558 2018-12-23 03:10:07 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
1559 2018-12-23 03:08:20 That would be assuming that all stocks perform the same!  Oh, goodness is that what your money manager is telling you?   No wonder!
1560 2018-12-23 03:06:44 The confusion many people are feeling in politics and stocks right now is that this is the end of not just a five, ten, twenty year cycle - This is the end of a 50+ year cycle in many things.
1561 2018-12-23 03:05:59 I’m taking my elderly mother to what will likely be her last Christmas with our family of Talibangelicals.  I think they’re all intelligent enough to keep their mouths shut  about politics.  If not  they will receive an earful.  One of them is heavy into stocks...I wonder...
1562 2018-12-23 03:03:58 It's a great rifle!  I have extra bumb stocks!
1563 2018-12-23 03:03:53 Bump stocks
1564 2018-12-23 03:03:37 Actually it's 8 times. Still, if the Fed didn't raise rates, there would be other consequences. The rates move in relation to jobs, stocks, inflation...  You should read up on it
1565 2018-12-23 03:03:09 It's a great relief to learn that the 2nd Amendment protects sticks, but not guns or bump stocks.
1566 2018-12-23 03:02:59 If bump stocks are banned, what will be next? Scopes? Laser sights? In Minnesota they tried to ban any gun that had a hand guard that allowed a rifle to be held with one hand.
1567 2018-12-23 03:02:48 Same way machine guns are not allowed - under an existing law. Trump, acting AG Whitaker & JD updated definition to include bump stocks which in essence turn semis to auto. But go ahead, respond & now argue on semantics. I’ll wait.
1568 2018-12-23 03:02:04 other than i'm doing just fine & don't really give a flying f*ck if they buy all the damn stocks! what I care about is you, and your fellow democratic pettiness & true gradeschool kid bullshit when it comes to defending our country and helping the people who lost a lot this year
1569 2018-12-23 02:59:37 You don’t like cheap stocks? Confused
1570 2018-12-23 02:59:36 Not many in this type of market. Maybe some utilities but those aren’t the ones that you want to own long term. Gold stocks have already bounced 35-40% from their lows. I like NVDA. BLUE for a spec. AAPL. TWLO. SQ.
1571 2018-12-23 02:57:45 No....stocks started falling because Dems won house and all they talk about is raising taxes and getting rid of the man who saved this a Country   Nobody wants to go back to the shitty economy & high taxes
1572 2018-12-23 02:57:07 @GabeHoff Only I noticed that the only stocks that really crash are the BigTechs and all the other are in the normal range? Even GM. It's a dead company with no any new technology or sales. But the blames is on Trump...
1573 2018-12-23 02:56:24 Bitcoin vs US Dollar.

One is inflationary while the other is deflationary.

Figure it out...

1574 2018-12-23 02:55:56 If you are not young, you shouldn’t have that much exposure to stocks. Sounds like your own fault.
1575 2018-12-23 02:55:18 Don't stop at purge. We need to bring back tarring & feathering, then stocks on the national mall where citizenry can expectorate in their general direction.
1576 2018-12-23 02:54:01 bitcoin is nothing like gold, lol. it did however help cause a speculative valuation spike in equities, especially semi’s and other tech stocks because of BS stories of mining bitcoins forever. valuations became stretched due to comparisons similar to internet bubble in 2000
1577 2018-12-23 02:49:59 Aren’t these all things that our president covets? It may not be all of the indicators, but it’s definitely a good start. The tax cut was supposed to add jet fuel to job creation, instead companies are buying back their stocks for shareholders and laying off their employees.
1578 2018-12-23 02:49:04 Congress trying to scratch out politics out of simplification of GST also.The coward UPA govt could not dare to bring GST and taunting that govt which has the guts to implement it.@RahulGandhi ammunition is dwindling fast.The question is his stocks are running dry very fast.
1579 2018-12-23 02:47:58 @LucidInvestment Hey,was wondering if you could give us some examples of hyperwaves in stocks or indexes around the world.

1585 2018-12-23 02:45:13 you can only do 1-3 stocks I think
1586 2018-12-23 02:44:57 Special licensing is what should have been done with bump-stocks. 
What he’s saying is exactly what was stated earlier; this isn’t the endgame. This is merely a step toward something more.
1587 2018-12-23 02:44:14 Psst every single person when pressed on what the f is common sense gun control ends up admitting they want guns confiscated.  Not fooling anyone at all. Guess what Trump gave in to your moronic bump stocks demands......havent heard anything from the left.
1588 2018-12-23 02:41:56 Bump Stocks are now illegal - belt loops can be used as bump stocks - hence Pants are now Illegal!
1589 2018-12-23 02:39:40 @illymation But is Luigi trying to 1v1 with three stocks though? 
1590 2018-12-23 02:39:39 Ate @maxinejiji may HIH may stocks pa po ba nung bagong reprint? Yung tatlong book lang?
1591 2018-12-23 02:38:36 Good! Bump stocks suck.
1592 2018-12-23 02:38:28 Sounds wonderful, & more industries should try that. So, you'd start by removing stocks from shareholders hands to make the power more equally  distributed? Or kicking out CEOs who's fathers or grandfathers began the business? 
1593 2018-12-23 02:37:41 Everyone’s showing off the kill confirm potential in Ultimate lately. Meanwhile, most of my stocks still come from edge guards and basic neutral interactions

I know its still early but I can’t picture my playstyle evolving past this point lol. Not with Mewtwo at least
1594 2018-12-23 02:37:16 @kylegriffin1 
Nah, stocks dropping is an excellent thing. Gives Americans to start buying into a market that was originally overpriced and expensive

1598 2018-12-23 02:34:27 I got carded at a liquor store, because I bought about half of its stocks... Then the store person found out that I'm as old as the earth, he got offended because I didn't buy everything instead. Well I just want to be conservative is all!

1600 2018-12-23 02:32:32 Some hard truths: 
Trump and congress should be applauded for bringing troops home, criminal justice reform, legalizing hemp via the Farm bill and banning bump stocks. I could care less about what he stands to gain; he deserves credit.
1601 2018-12-23 02:32:01 Car j'en ai eu l'occasion, j'entends souvent "chacun sa merde et son combat". Ces gens viennent en SUV ou c4, font des stocks de bouffe pour leur rond point, ramène de quoi avoir chaud pr tt le monde...et n'ont jamais bougé face aux sdf morts de froid. Et ça m'énerve bcp.

1604 2018-12-23 02:28:48 Where's the stock market for cultural artifacts? 

Who gives a fuck about some company or stocks?
1605 2018-12-23 02:26:36 this is fascinating to watch; all of DC seems to be hyperventilating;

1607 2018-12-23 02:22:04 Bitcoin could outperform stocks and index in 2019
1608 2018-12-23 02:21:51 After 2018.......2019 will be a year to build portfolios....

Having the courage to accumulate the right stocks in a bear market...will always give great rewards during the next bull run.

But the challenge is to no one knows how long will it take for the bull market to come!
1609 2018-12-23 02:21:49 C est une bonne exp. de bosser dans ce genre de condition mais c est fatiguant à la longue. Les stocks sont minables, le service client est different. C est chiant ahah.
1610 2018-12-23 02:20:52 Haha. Stocks.
1611 2018-12-23 02:19:28 Judging by the tweets here, @GunOwners has a lot of work to do with regards to education. We have an EO that redefines what full auto weapons are,and all people are focused on are bump stocks.
1612 2018-12-23 02:18:52 War only benefits those who owns stocks in military contractors, the rest of us merely die in them.

1614 2018-12-23 02:17:52 Oh the dumbass rules persist regardless. Elite smash is nothing but an indicator of the top percentage in GSP, basically a title. It changes nothing to do with matchmaking or its quality.

1615 2018-12-23 02:17:50 Put:Call ratio showed investors panicked yet the bond traders did not do the flight to quality bond trade. Stocks liquidated to cash and will come back in Jan.
1616 2018-12-23 02:16:43 The downward momentum for stocks will continue during the next months. I predict that we will see a massive flow of capital from the stock market into commodities (mostly #gold) and #Bitcoin. BTC likely already bottomed and the demand will rise. Most alts will die though. #crypto
1617 2018-12-23 02:16:28 I would buy stocks, so I would stay rich after that day
1618 2018-12-23 02:14:32 No one cares about all the stocks that went down?
1619 2018-12-23 02:13:32 I wish something could be done with my 401K and the small amount of stocks I have. What an awful week. Hopefully it will be a spiritual weekend
1620 2018-12-23 02:13:28 If stocks break hard the fed will cut aggressively, cause a disaster will be blamed fully on the fed. They do nothing right. This will pump #bitcoin like crazy

1625 2018-12-23 02:09:19 All you need is an NFA stamp, about $200. Every American is "allowed" to own full auto weapons,the government banning the manufacture of them keeps the cost restrictive. Bump stocks don't make a gun full auto by definition. Educate yourself or lose your rights.
1626 2018-12-23 02:08:32 If bump stocks were unpopular why would it matter if they banned it? Sometimes the govt has to step in though.
1627 2018-12-23 02:07:48 The market has swings regardless of President. Any financial advisor (or Google) will tell you to move money away from stocks as you age. If youve lost money while the markets gone up substantially the last 2 years and ignore basic retirement advice, it's nobodys fault but yours
1628 2018-12-23 02:07:02 Tipsy last night and this dude wanted to play me in smash,did a pretty sick combo and he got mad at me and was like “yo chill out dude” so I did but then he got a stock on me and I got angry and whooped his ass for another two stocks. I’m sorry guy I don’t know why I’m like this
1629 2018-12-23 02:07:00 Perfectly plausible scenario if Trump finds a way to oust Fed's Powell:  
1) dollar plunges
2) long-term bond yields soar
3) stocks collapse
4) gold rockets
5) Trump channels his inner Nixon, falls to knees in Oval Office and asks Pence to join him. "Let us pray, Mike."
1630 2018-12-23 02:04:54 TAEYONG IS GWEN I JUST WANNA SEW YUTA IN THE STOCKS IN THE FIRST EPISODE AND TAEYONG LAUGHING SOFTLY AT HIM AND BEFRIENDING HIM

1632 2018-12-23 02:04:23 Thank you! What Canadian and U.S. pot stocks do you recommend right now?
1633 2018-12-23 02:02:26 Just bump stocks. Plus other things implemented. AR15s aren't the problem. It's called a respect, discipline, and ethical one. No morals any longer.
1634 2018-12-23 02:02:13 And the high-vis #YellowVest companies’ stocks are v high right about now...
1635 2018-12-23 02:02:05 So, what is someone to do with their now illegal bump stocks?  Asking for a friend.
1636 2018-12-23 02:00:12 Bump stocks are now banned, at least in NC. I feel like David Hogg and his friends might have influenced that decision.
1637 2018-12-23 02:00:06 And yet all y'all did was freak out that a black Muslim man would take your guns away. The right's fear of Obama prevented any meaningful discussions. Bump stocks: one mass shooting. Common sense gun reform: Not on the table. What about loosening laws for mental instability?
1638 2018-12-23 01:59:40 I like you @DanCrenshawTX. I am an independent and I like your brand. What @AdamSchiff said is all fact. The Dow is down 2000 points, companies did buyback stocks and other than 1 time PR bonuses wages are still stagnant. And GM is eliminating 14k jobs. What’s not right?
1639 2018-12-23 01:59:12 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
1640 2018-12-23 01:58:43 I can’t tell if you mean those dumbass stock photos or like... investment stocks lmao either way you’re right
1641 2018-12-23 01:58:14 Just as no one rings a bell at the top of a cycle no one will ring a bell at the bottom. The opportunity in a correction is to generate alpha from the mistakes of other investors: "When stocks go down and you can get more for your money; people don’t like them anymore.” WEB

1643 2018-12-23 01:55:35 invest into stocks Jimmy
1644 2018-12-23 01:53:58 Plenty of people own the companies inside of XOP. There are pumpers and dumpers in every single stock. That is the definition of a stock, buyers and sellers. More buyers and it rises, period. Happens to all stocks. People have invested in oil stocks for ages and have done well.
1645 2018-12-23 01:52:41 In the short term perhaps. But like stocks were a haven for oil selling gold may become a have for stocks selling then something else will be a haven from gold selling.

1648 2018-12-23 01:50:48 One of my favourite observations in stocks is the size of each move. On bigger timeframes these moves often repeat, with some extremes during periods where markets are overbought or oversold. Try this for yourself. Where are we now for the size of this leg down in your stocks?

1650 2018-12-23 01:50:00 I think it was banking/ stocks and bonds type of thing.

Only reason why Hans and them would break into Nakatomi
1651 2018-12-23 01:48:54 The key is investigating in indexes rather than individual stocks. 10 years from now FB ‘could be non existent’ but spx will be at 10,000
1652 2018-12-23 01:48:50 I lost $100 on stocks smh
1653 2018-12-23 01:48:11 They did follow thru and ban Bump Stocks making them illegal to own at all. Small, but a positive thing. The only other thing I think of is the Trillions added to the debt already. Wait, you said help people didn't you?
1654 2018-12-23 01:46:43 @DonaldJTrumpJr 

Sir. The President has ruffled some feathers with the DOJ banning bump stocks.  We both know they are garbage, but still a ban is troubling.  The President could make suppressors legal to purchase under the ATF Form 4473. You still have a background check. VOTES
1655 2018-12-23 01:46:38 Nah. That is stored in the bedroom. It’s like the innocent nerd room & the den of debauchery elsewhere. (The suspension rig & the stocks are stored up there).
1656 2018-12-23 01:46:05 Legit no lie. I fought a little Mac that just spammed smash attack and it was on omega and 2 stocks
1657 2018-12-23 01:44:25 Out of his control. Or are you saying he personally grew the stocks of the 1%? Plus Obama like most corporate dems is a moderate Republican. The real progressives in this country never make it until office so don't throw his baggage on me.
1658 2018-12-23 01:44:01 most of us will be informed sometime before April I guess March or before..We all will be meeting our bankers and our complete worth in income, stocks, portfolios, etc, will be upgraded to the new rate. Aclue is this:the 2.7Cent dollar will worth 100 cents- imagine the increase!
1659 2018-12-23 01:43:46 You must be loco. @realDonaldTrump has done nothing for America. Businesses moving out, stocks like great DEPRESSION, every sane person has left him, turns against our allies. NOTHING GOOD CAME FROM TRUMP. #TrumpResign 
Slave labor #TrumpShutdown 
Get a grip lady.
1660 2018-12-23 01:43:33 Yes, bump stock ban is bad, the ban itself isn't that impactful, bump stocks are unpopular and impractical, but it shows that the govt is willing to restrict our power against it, which it's been doing for years, the second amendment is starting to be more of a self defense issue
1661 2018-12-23 01:43:26 I started a tweet this morning. The market last week lost abou 20 % . The odd thing is there was no buy back. Stocks at a discounted price? No buyers? My theory was some BIG money was taken out of that market. Scared everyone. I never posted it because they’d say I’m crazy.
1662 2018-12-23 01:43:24 And watched Martin short standup. And short some stocks.
1663 2018-12-23 01:42:48 It’s 3.75 most other places. .50 higher for real estate. Still higher than last year PADD5 stocks lower. 

There lots of refiners within 20 miles of here. Seems kind if expensive.
1664 2018-12-23 01:39:39 Well, since you don't own any stocks it doesn't matter. As long as the demand for shit shoveling backwood crackers is there you'll do just fine.
1665 2018-12-23 01:39:34 Elle me manque l’époque des dvd gravé sur des disques vierges, j’avais des stocks de films infini
1666 2018-12-23 01:39:29 Thought I was smart getting back in Dec 3rd after being in cash Oct and Nov.  Out again as of 4pm Friday.  Kind of hope this shithouse burns down for another month (with the exception of cannabis & hemp stocks ). I want to pick up the pieces.
1667 2018-12-23 01:39:23 Pretty sad man one lgs already closed near me and the only one in my actual town only runs drafts when they feel like it and only stocks boosters and modern/legacy cards for some reason. Cant find anyone to play with and while I play MTGArena, it's kinda pointless to spend on it.
1668 2018-12-23 01:39:21 Thanks to the fed stocks are in free fall. 401k in the toilet. They are stealing our buying power buy printing money. They create money out of thin air and change us interest to use it.
1669 2018-12-23 01:39:14 They could all be given a time line to clean up. No acceptions . maybe then the wales will be healthier and the fish stocks improve.
1670 2018-12-23 01:38:54 bro I'm struggling so hard to close out stocks with Bayo, online I got a heavy to 250+% :(
1671 2018-12-23 01:38:07 I sold all my stocks this week 
1672 2018-12-23 01:37:01 @AndrewIsker @realDonaldTrump let the ATF ban bump stocks.... then he just shut the whole government. #4dchess
1673 2018-12-23 01:36:42 IMO, pot stocks are still massively overvalued. Even after recent crash, Canopy Growth still valued in excess of entire CDN market size. Speculative at best.
1674 2018-12-23 01:35:17 Gotta love how libtards wanna talk about the stocks when it has a bad month LMFAO FOOLS
1675 2018-12-23 01:35:06 i'm pretty sure the secret signal to sell stocks is as soon as CNBC starts pumping it
1676 2018-12-23 01:34:51 I understand your point, I am saying that most new markets that exhibit signs of irrational exuberance by traders tend to have that exact same pattern. If you pick most pre dot com boom stocks, and you’ll see that same behavior. Ford and Ethereum are still completely unrelated.
1677 2018-12-23 01:34:50 I said I could pick stocks at random that in 2019 would outperform 2018 crypto returns...  overthinking it imo.  We both agree that crypto will do better in 2019
1678 2018-12-23 01:33:59 seriously, to the people freaking out about this past week or 2 in the market, maybe investing in stocks isn't for you....
1679 2018-12-23 01:33:49 As in a good bundle of Jamaican stocks was the best investment in the world this year
1680 2018-12-23 01:33:11 The Jamaica Stock Exchange performed better than Gold, Bitcoin, Weed stocks and stocks in the top four tech giants this year
1681 2018-12-23 01:32:57 I have been doing the exact same thing.Only difference is I use my credit card to fund my Robinhood account and trade stocks.

1686 2018-12-23 01:30:45 I consider seasons 3 stocks getting into the season
1687 2018-12-23 01:30:15 Twitter isn’t the best place for that given the short form factor. That said the DOW dropped because of the interest rate hike from fed. Which isn’t a bad thing because stocks were over priced. More important indicators are GDP, job growth, unemployment. All very strong.
1688 2018-12-23 01:30:06 ...I have a problem with growth-stock investing. Companies tend not to grow at high rates forever. Businesses change... Markets mature. Competition can increase. Good managements can retire... the market is littered with once highly profitable growth stocks... -- Ed Wachenheim
1689 2018-12-23 01:29:01 It’s slanted but not dishonest. The facts are real. What are you going to do to fix this?! Deficit is out of control, stocks are crashing. Ask yourself this, are you better off now than you were 2 years ago?

1691 2018-12-23 01:26:53 As recently as a WEEK before the crash began, the vast majority of American investors hadn't even considered selling their stocks yet.
They couldn't see a future that now seems so obvious in hindsight.
You and I are no different.We have no idea what will happen next.
Ever.
1692 2018-12-23 01:25:43 don’t think bitcoin mania on upside had nothing to do with adding to stock valuations...semi’s especially, were bid up to ridiculous prices because people thought bitcoin mining would bring huge profits. that has as much to do with sell off as internet stocks did back in 2000
1693 2018-12-23 01:24:59 I like the family of companies that $NOUV is apart of. $PURA is legit and if $PURA is associating themselves with these other stocks then they must be legit too. Also I’ve read some good stuff about all their different operations. Industry is just waking up. Patience.
1694 2018-12-23 01:24:38 For too long I believed a certain penny stocks furu when he said options were too risky and there's no money to be made with blue chips. With options I've combined both and make more in a month than I did in 2 years trying to learn from that clown.
1695 2018-12-23 01:23:58 All are packed in good looking boxes.
Shit too. Box opens at stocks 52 week low
1696 2018-12-23 01:23:27 And it’s not funded by increased taxes or existing tax dollars, but instead by unrealized capital gains. There is currently $6.1 trillion in capital gains sitting in mutual funds, stocks, and corporations that investors have not cashed in.
1697 2018-12-23 01:20:11 economy being “fine”comparing it to 2008-2009,is head/shoulders above then,but,if slightly off peak, with stocks being ridiculously bubbled by financial engineering, then stocks needed to reset. also, bitcoin mania added to valuation spike just like internet stocks in late 90’s

1700 2018-12-23 01:19:03 @MariaBartiromo I just have to say Maria you are awesome! I remember when I was trading stocks twenty-something years ago you are on CNBC. You are so knowledgeable and committed to your job. You look like you've done well. Just another admirer. Thank you and good luck on Fox
1701 2018-12-23 01:19:01 Most of the investing universe believes that bonds will go up as the stocks fall. That has been true for over 27 years and is the thesis of risk parity funds. I believe this time will not be so. Bonds will not go up in meaningful way on declines but will decline on rallies
1702 2018-12-23 01:19:00 Trump lets stock market sink, then have his cronies to buy up stocks at lowest prices possible, followed by taking back some stupid things he said, to fix stock market, and selling these cheaply bought stocks with huge profits. Share prints after his presidency with his friends

1710 2018-12-23 01:12:44 This is a garden variety bear market in stocks. The latest sell-off has been unusually swift, hence some anxiety. The real financial market bubble is in levered loans. Crypto was a bubble and BS simultaneously. With the proper catalysts, stocks rebound with time. Crypto will not!

When the big boy institutions stop supporting stocks and let the shorts/quants/algos take over, ALL stocks are TOAST and long-term investors are left holding the bag.
1726 2018-12-23 01:02:13 Depends if you’re using option pricing or ETFs for exposure. February and October were great for those of us using VIX reversals for tail skewness in out of the money option pricing on cyclical stocks.
1727 2018-12-23 01:02:12 ...I’d disagree with you on that one. The market was doing very well up to the point when Trump started launching his global America First economic war against the whole world. Not good for companies trying to complete in that world. Of course stocks got shattered.
1728 2018-12-23 01:02:06 We lose our jobs when bankers, speculators, and politicians manipulate currencies, stocks, bonds, interest rates, wars, media, and taxes.
1729 2018-12-23 01:01:13 this is a stock market event, similar to internet bubble bursting. stocks got way way ahead of the real economy, because Obamamwanted it that way. if Bernanke/Yellen had raised rate sooner, stopped QE sooner, stopped intervening in stocks, then we wouldn’t be here.economy is fine
1730 2018-12-23 00:58:31 are any of the pot stocks paying dividends?
1731 2018-12-23 00:58:26 Damnit I had 2 stocks
1732 2018-12-23 00:57:08 That was an odd sound. Traditionally a greeting/first meeting has more screaming but, once again I am a radio host, so my screams must be preserved for the stocks report.

1734 2018-12-23 00:56:02 But these fortunes are mostly virtual valuations and not a real money. If any of them would start liquidating stocks he wouldn't get enough buyers. Stocks are the same as cryptocurrencies - the more you cash out the less valuable it is... the loger you hodl the richer until bust.
1735 2018-12-23 00:54:02 A lot of indicators seem to have worked for the past 7 or so years (put/call, % of stocks over the 200 day, etc) but during 07-09, they didn’t work as well when oversold just got more and more oversold. Was just curious if you had this data going back further than 2014
1736 2018-12-23 00:52:33 I'm so worried that my stocks won't make it in time. my cons are in three days asldkgjhalgkjanhlaetrhorifk
1737 2018-12-23 00:52:31 FACT stock markets lowest since 1930’s depression. NEXT?
Course it not likely affect you right what with all your stocks and bonds and all...right? #TrumpIsATraitor #trumpResign
1738 2018-12-23 00:52:11 Cheers mate, what cutoff have you run that on to have circa 1630 stocks included in it?

I have convinced my die hard repub mom & now she's not going to vote for him again. Good chance my dad wont either, esp if stocks are low.

My sm. Biz owner hubs supports low taxes, so we need a dem that will support sm. biz
1741 2018-12-23 00:49:53 Corporations used their windfall to buy back stocks, falsely elevating them. Every economist predicted this.
1742 2018-12-23 00:47:21 Ok now take out a $100k HELOC and buy some stocks.
1743 2018-12-23 00:47:18 no i see the stocks now its just little palu heads NEVERMIND my mistake
1744 2018-12-23 00:46:36 how do you swap out the different logos? is it done by a script, or do you have them there at all times, just visibility turned off on the layer? and are those Stock icons different? how do you cause the stocks to go down? is it automatic, or do you have to manually do it live?
1745 2018-12-23 00:46:09 -Repubs work, pay taxes, buy stuff, invest in stocks to grow wealth! 

-Dems (many) don’t work, want “free” stuff, don’t pay taxes & hate success (Antifa)!

LOL, Dems & @SenSchumer want “Open Borders” so Illegals can take Dems “Free Stuff”! #tcot #ccot
1746 2018-12-23 00:46:08 What if all the money moving from stocks to crypto will be used to short cryptos instead of buying them? After all, it would make sense for traders to go along with the year long McDownTrend...
1747 2018-12-23 00:44:19 Many stocks have high targets. What has changed? In some, much, in others, nothing. They are buys!
1748 2018-12-23 00:43:35 technical analyses is voodoo for the most part and especially for resource/mining stocks, so many bigger factors in play that a bunch of lines and guess are simply that
1749 2018-12-23 00:43:27 good shit to @RiotLettuce for taking two stocks within 5 seconds
1750 2018-12-23 00:42:36 The seeds of leadership changes in stocks/sectors are most often sown during 8%-12% intermediate-term corrections or outright bear markets. O'Neil research shows that the average big-winning stock in a bull will correct 73% during the next bear. There are a few exceptions #stocks
1751 2018-12-23 00:42:35 There's always a bull market somewhere. I believe that. I'm down more than 20%. Gonna recover. Maybe not in the same stocks.
1752 2018-12-23 00:42:23 Are foreign countrified selling USA stocks?  Noted that US dollar  declined even after surprise hawkish Federal Reserve meeting...not a  good sign...trump abandons our allies ...and our allies may have had  enough of trump...  @GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP

"Couch and Caviar."
Today, a sign tells me I will be "made whole" with "couch and caviar".
There is nothing even remotely whole about lying in a comatose state, taking the life out of fish stocks, while many in the world go hungry.
1755 2018-12-23 00:41:23 but without splits, it also makes it easier for etf’s to take the stocks up!! lol. you are so intellectually dishonest and one sided, it’s painful to read and listen. 
1756 2018-12-23 00:41:12 Following Peter Lynch's Cocktail Party theory, last couple of days people love to tell me what a terrible time it is to own stocks.
1757 2018-12-23 00:41:09 Pot stocks, Vanguard, lotta options for sure
1758 2018-12-23 00:40:00 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
1759 2018-12-23 00:39:40 pot stocks, before all the pick and shovel buys get bought out.
1760 2018-12-23 00:39:19 S&P 500 is down less than 20% from its high in September and “crypto experts” are calling for the apocalypse. Bitcoin is down nearly 80% from its high in December 2017 and “crypto experts” are saying buy bitcoin instead of stocks.  know what you own and why you own it
1761 2018-12-23 00:38:02 actually, I bought stocks in ladder and pitchfork companies recently...covering all the bases 
1762 2018-12-23 00:36:42 @SeananLizs the market will come down another 1,000 plus points just wait and c.... AND THEN BUY!! #stocks
1763 2018-12-23 00:36:05 I publish daily. All a matter of public record. My primary focus after years at Fed was liquidity. It’s absence is a de facto negative. I began sounding warnings as QE turned from neutral at start of year to negative though I caveated that buybacks would bolster US stocks.
1764 2018-12-23 00:35:51 Of note: among all the losing stocks this day/week/month/year, including the gaming sector, two companies are making money for shareholders: GPI (the former PauSon chip company) and @GalaxyGamingLV. So it is possible to be net positive.

1766 2018-12-23 00:35:10 Bumpstocks banned! @MBOKSR_MAGA Bump-stocks are easily home made &have always been. Banning production of them only affected the law abiding citizen.The mental midgets such as yourself &the ban will have no impact on mass shooters using them. You’re stupid &embarrassing yourself.
1767 2018-12-23 00:34:58 I see entering a bear market as a great opportunity to pick up more shares of great companies at cheaper prices. I've been saving 20% of my income all year and I'd like to put some of that money to work.

1773 2018-12-23 00:32:20 Keep in mind, during several biotech selloffs stocks went to $.50 and $1, later to be worth $150-250 per share, Remember that when your account is going down to nothing in this downturn, it’s important to remember perspective, $jazz $pcyc $xbi
1774 2018-12-23 00:31:57 Remainer here.

Why in heck would there be a shortage now 'because of brexit'?

Unless some moron is stockpiling using the supply we already have (i..e diverting current supply) rather than buying in extra stocks.
1775 2018-12-23 00:29:41 Hope is just the greedy rich is using the fake news channels to generate the chaos to buy the beaten up stocks. The worse fear we should have is China or other countries subsidized firms to create the chaos to buy out the cheap stocks, then transfer the firms to that country.

1777 2018-12-23 00:28:22 I bet Mnuchin owns a lot of stocks, lol....
1778 2018-12-23 00:27:36 I have a great understanding of economics. Have you noticed how much stocks have dropped this year? Probably not, because your idiot hasn't talked about it. This administration is in the shitter. Enjoy the shutdown though troll
1779 2018-12-23 00:26:08 I played samsora yesterday he’s so old, I only took two stocks off him with my secondary lol and he was playing peach
1780 2018-12-23 00:25:49 Mr. President please look at what the federal reserve is doing to our economy. We are letting a private banker control our economy. Stocks in free fall. 401k in the toilet. They are ruining our economy.
1781 2018-12-23 00:25:46 I’m buying stocks in Ray J company, this shit will blow on my mom I know it
1782 2018-12-23 00:24:36 i read something the other day that was talking about how stocks aren't representational of the economy so i wouldn't worry too much
1783 2018-12-23 00:23:43 Also mark my words, I will be investing beginning next year for value stocks st least one month. I’m expecting a minimum 20% increase minimum because value stocks have gone down wrongly do!
1784 2018-12-23 00:22:37 My sister “adopted” a girl for Christmas and asked the coordinator what to get and she said “stocks” so she bought stock in Disney for the girl. Come to find out now the text from the coordinator said “socks”.

@FoxInTown_
1786 2018-12-23 00:21:03 I am ready to buy stocks. What's the next step? Where me go?
1787 2018-12-23 00:20:26 I’m curious is in less than it was a year ago or less than 2016?  After Trump was elected my stocks were soaring, then the Dems took the house and they’re not doing so well.
1788 2018-12-23 00:20:03 Democrats DID NOT give a huge tax break to the rich who used those $ to buy back stocks and give themselves bonuses. The stock buy back caused the artificial gains in the stock market while Joe & Mary Q Citizen got zero. Feed your BUL*SHI* to your ignorant GOP base while it last.
1789 2018-12-23 00:19:18 Bump stocks give me a break with a little practice you can shoot a damn gone just about as fast as that you'd have to be a retard if you couldn't make a bump stock in one day let's hire some more bush-era Swamp People starting to believe you're part of the swamp
1790 2018-12-23 00:18:37 Sir if you feel selling stocks now is a mistake then why are you worried about the Fed?
1791 2018-12-23 00:18:36 She failed   without   stocks ?? :') 
1792 2018-12-23 00:17:42 next what? Did other stocks pump?
1793 2018-12-23 00:17:38 Stocks were all doing pretty good until the Dems were elected to the majority.
1794 2018-12-23 00:17:12 Does anyone here knows a lot about economics? Can anyone tell me if America is possibly near a big market crash?

All the stocks are down, it doesn't look good.

1798 2018-12-23 00:09:21 I seriously gonna invest in some more stocks now yah man
1799 2018-12-23 00:08:38 When there is such fear in the market it's best to buy qlty stocks! I am loading up, just as I advised my Mrs. 

I might be too early but by using 5 year range I mitigate the risk, I am happy to lose out slightly by getting in soon.

Buy the fear, sell the greed!

1810 2018-12-23 00:02:45 the only stocks that are in the high green are crypto stocks if your watching on robinhood the few that are green are bound to have a major sell off so currently i have no tech shares unless its crypto. sure there's green stocks else where but i rather take the easy way.
1811 2018-12-23 00:02:45 Your temper tantrums have robbed us of our 401K retirement because you are purposely tanking the market. You have people swoop in and buy stocks for you and then you make a lot of money by selling later. This is not a game for you to rob us. #TrumpResign

1816 2018-12-23 00:01:26 For the record: I'm not a bear, but the Fed Chief Powell wants to kill stocks. Plain and simple. And if you didn't see it a week ago, you deserve to be taken out to pasture.
1817 2018-12-23 00:01:10 I’m trying to get into stocks all I know is I only invested $50 and I’m already down 5%
1818 2018-12-22 23:58:49 Businesses are the stocks which the economy relies on for literally everything. Wal-Mart's closing down and grocers in your city which kills the convenience of getting food. People would farm, hunt, or kill and steal if not travel longer distances. That's just 1 example

1823 2018-12-22 23:55:04 The correlation of stocks across all ETFs to the ES_F is scary.  When people want out of an ETF, the manager of the ETF hits a sell button to sell all stocks in the ETF with no regard for value.  The markets may be setting up for a 1987 Portfolio Insurance moment.

1825 2018-12-22 23:52:56 On point 5-I disagree. Not sure what you’re getting at here. If the market goes higher , that means the price of stocks is going higher. Buybacks aren’t necessarily manipulation , but may be foolhardy. Manipulation today best seen via computer algorithm buy or sell programs.
1826 2018-12-22 23:52:52 Stocks are in free fall, as you say, because of the Federal Reserve.    All Administrations change a lot of personnel after mid terms.                    We don’t need to be nation building. Just keep an eye on ISIS and bomb their ass

1831 2018-12-22 23:50:09 Tying your political future to a volitile system like stocks, which can plunge if the president sneezes wrong, is a terrible idea. Most Americans don’t even own stocks so it’s only a barometer for his rich friends
1832 2018-12-22 23:49:54 Yes, I am wondering what a manipulative game he is playing. Every time the rates are lowered, the stocks go down. Wealthy people can then by low and sell high later when they go up and be even morewealthier while we, the common folk are paying higher interest rates.

1847 2018-12-22 23:51:01 “Mnuchin says stocks may be tumbling because of high-frequency traders and the Volcker Rule, which has prevented banks from using their own money to make speculative bets since 2013.” 
1848 2018-12-22 23:50:53 Ptn je suis une merde, SD a 0 game 2 alors que j'avais fin game 1 avec 2 stocks d'avance 
1849 2018-12-22 23:50:39 Yesterday @fagerhult signed the #agreement to acquire @iGuzzini for €385MLN to be paid 74% #cash & 26% with new #stocks.The new Group will have an aggregated #turnover of €800MLN & 5.000 employees.IGuzzini will close 2018 with a total turnover of €240MLN & 14% #EBITDA.
1850 2018-12-22 23:50:09 Tying your political future to a volitile system like stocks, which can plunge if the president sneezes wrong, is a terrible idea. Most Americans don’t even own stocks so it’s only a barometer for his rich friends
1851 2018-12-22 23:49:54 Yes, I am wondering what a manipulative game he is playing. Every time the rates are lowered, the stocks go down. Wealthy people can then by low and sell high later when they go up and be even morewealthier while we, the common folk are paying higher interest rates.
1852 2018-12-22 23:49:22 $NOUV is going to be over
.01 at a minimum in the coming weeks!  Partnership with $KALY is big and their stock is already trading above .02. CBD stocks will be the next big hit!
1853 2018-12-22 23:49:05 Poor Donald is mad and depressed.
He’s failing the test to "Be Best."
Stocks are fueling his pique.
Wall-dough funding looks bleak...
And just wait till he’s under arrest.

@realDonaldTrump
1854 2018-12-22 23:49:04 And ever since I switched back to crypto from tech stocks I got a lot of money.
1855 2018-12-22 23:48:04 No. Hillary means her portfolio of war contractor stocks would lose value. She has proven she does not care if other people die.
Killing civilians is wrong.
1856 2018-12-22 23:47:59 Bump stocks are not guns.
1857 2018-12-22 23:47:18 Man you liberals are war mongers. Liberals used to say the FBI could not be trusted, spying on Americans happens often and these wars need to end. Now you love the FBI, u have no problem with spying on Americans and you’re pro war. Trump banned bump stocks, are u happy???
1858 2018-12-22 23:46:43 So just so we are 100% clear you are fine with politicians who invest their money into stocks and companies and take money from lobbyists but a politician who asks for less handouts despite struggling until their pay check is too far?
1859 2018-12-22 23:45:17 Who could have possible held through that, except insiders $AMZN . These stories are why retail investors keep holding the bag on single stocks looking for the next big winner.
1860 2018-12-22 23:44:51 Can’t wait to see everybody roast me because I like to taunt after stocks DX
1861 2018-12-22 23:43:38 stocks rise by 1%.
1862 2018-12-22 23:42:58 Real deal laughing stocks especially when you know they ain’t living like that
1863 2018-12-22 23:42:54 Banning bump stocks is also treason.
1864 2018-12-22 23:41:50 Dripped down to the stocks
1865 2018-12-22 23:41:29 He's a very old freshman with low stocks and only moderate 3-point volume. Pump the breaks, perhaps?
1866 2018-12-22 23:41:22 I'm so ready for a recession: cheap property, stocks, and employees
1867 2018-12-22 23:41:19 The closest thing I have to a Co-op is a student union shop that stocks co-op products, but plays no music. *curses the youth of today*
1868 2018-12-22 23:39:52 Ask me if I gave stocks? Go Ahead! Ask me is Exchange matters to me, go ahead! Commmme on, Go Ahead! What top 52% you think can Afford stocks? Go Ahead I'll wait for those numbers, you think middle class America on stocks! Doubt it!
1869 2018-12-22 23:36:53 This is propaganda....  My stocks are way up under Trump.  Govt still taking my tax dollars, still functional. People definitely in charge at DOJ.  Not forsaken our allies. Children are being cared for at border while their parents are in custody for breaking our laws..Propaganda
1870 2018-12-22 23:36:52 The bottom isn't in until this permabull AKA ruiner of MANY people's portfolio finally leaves for weed stocks like he promised. HE PROMISED TO LEAVE US!
1871 2018-12-22 23:36:11 I see how @RobinhoodApp works, promises of 1 free share of stock, they dont tell you that, Im guessing, the majority of what they are holding on to are penny stocks (stocks trading under $5 a share), or stocks very near that, like the groupon share they gave me for signing up
1872 2018-12-22 23:35:37 Discouragement if you're invested in the index, panic if you look at some individual names ICUI  WEX etc. they are in free fall.  stocks above their 50dma is now at 7.9%
1873 2018-12-22 23:35:23 This nigga donald trump got my stocks super fucked up with this government shutdown shit smh damn b dumb niggas really fuck it up for everyone else
1874 2018-12-22 23:35:12 Jonathan, I have enjoyed your ideas on stocks for many yrs..  I think you have lost it w/Trump. I really think you've lost it ... You r the " never Trump" guys and now your annoyed? He Cut Taxes? He has Deregulated! .... THESE Things have worked!   What the heck is ur problem?
1875 2018-12-22 23:34:50 $AMZN and all stocks should trade based on valuations in real markets, not a market affected by the FED. Pricing should be on organic growth, borrowing should be based on the price of money determined by markets, not the FED.
1876 2018-12-22 23:34:48 I wanna get into stocks & investment to leave something behind for my child
1877 2018-12-22 23:34:22 1)Buybacks have hollowed out balance sheet enriching execs. and creating no productive debt for future cash flow 2)ETFs are this market's portfolio insurance: Passive investing = safety? NOT No value investing, so stocks rise beyond value just because of their weighting in an ETF
1878 2018-12-22 23:33:27 Yes you R correct.What I stated was stocks will be cheaper by April 15 .My thinking is (1) Earnings will be down in Jan Qtr & April Qtr (2) By April a lot of uncertainty will be gone markets will have figured stock price based upon guidance going forward,Tarrifs,EM Growth China .
1879 2018-12-22 23:33:21 I disagree. All stocks are affected. Its just some more than others. $AAPL has real valuation in cash, of course. But if the FED didnt pump the economy, there would be fewer buyers for $700 phones. And AAPL may the the cheapest of the FAANG. NFLX ihas been outrageously priced.
1880 2018-12-22 23:32:57 Unchanged might be an inverse  proxy for volatility in a way. In volatile markets even normally non moving issues like preferred stocks and short term bond errs move.
1881 2018-12-22 23:31:52 Report: Goldfish Stocks Tank; Hopes Sink
1882 2018-12-22 23:31:34 Idk why she keeps finding food stocks but she won't able to move at this rate
1883 2018-12-22 23:30:23 The bottom 90% of Americans only own ~15% of stocks.

This mkt is only hitting the top decile that’s been benefiting these past few yrs
1884 2018-12-22 23:29:50 Oh, please!  Enough of the drama & whiny TDS. We survived 8 yrs of Obama, so I’m pretty sure you will survive 8 years of Trump.  I make no excuses for him...again....I simply stated that risky investments (stocks) are exactly that...Risky. Sometimes u earn & sometimes u lose.
1885 2018-12-22 23:29:44 No, they are overvalued because the “best tax break in history” gave corporations so much back in tax savings that they inflated the values of their stocks by buying back huge amounts of shares. Trump doesn’t know legit business. All his startups have failed miserably.
1886 2018-12-22 23:28:27 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS - keep spiraling the Stocks into the ground, your entire Republican Party will abandon you and the democrats will laugh at you.  This is no MAGA. This is awful.  WORST DEC in history.
1887 2018-12-22 23:28:23 can't say the same for my 401K...US stocks taking a hit thanks to 45
1888 2018-12-22 23:27:43 Can be another epic crater week in stocks. It's a slow motion crash. Everyone knows that every single rally is being sold. That means, no upside. That means, everyone out of the pool. Unless you are aiming for bagholder status.
1889 2018-12-22 23:27:33 I was going to transfer stocks to annuities last spring. . . Big regret
1890 2018-12-22 23:26:50 no worries, i wish I could fly over to go to a wal-mart that stocks them just to buy some then go back, but now just have to hope Spin master don;t take to long to release them here, least they said the EU don;t need to wait a whole year for it to come overseas
1891 2018-12-22 23:26:29 Nice that someone brought their Switch setup to locals. Had fun playing Chrom and Shulk. 

My Incineroar needs work :(((((( Cross Chop is so a janky ass move. My opponent had trouble actually taking stocks off me, so Cross Chop did it for him lmao
1892 2018-12-22 23:26:18 Democrats will not betray their constituents, like Donald Trump and republicans have betrayed their country. Republicans have a tax break to the top 1% and now STOCKS ARE PLUMMETING. NO BILLIONS for the wall, until concessions are made in writing by Donald Trump.
1893 2018-12-22 23:25:45 Bump stocks merely open the door.
1894 2018-12-22 23:25:43 Who cares, David Hogg got the bump stocks banned. Go David!
1895 2018-12-22 23:24:12 So twitters stocks keeps tumbling down and down and they decided to suspend shit load of "NEW" people that are semi big accounts? Just because and really for not breaking any rules on XMAS of all times? I am getting this right?
1896 2018-12-22 23:24:12 The Canadian #PermanentPortfolio was up 0.16% this week. A strong move from gold helped overcome a big drop in stocks.

XIC -4.34% #stocks
ZFL +1.28% #bonds
MNT +3.44% #gold
VSG +0.25% #cash
1897 2018-12-22 23:22:30 Always wonder when i see stocks crater 50% if it is the president’s fault
1898 2018-12-22 23:22:03 True but who would buy long term bonds given interest rate risk and why buy stocks trading at nose bleed valuations. Also the federal resolve is now - literally - insolvent ~ by there own measure. It doesnt lend to confidence in the dollar much.
1899 2018-12-22 23:21:34 My husband‘s father is first generation American and his mother second generation and all they care about is their stocks, so Trump can do whatever the fuck he wants , and that they’re fine with it as long as they’re making money... but are they? FFS?
1900 2018-12-22 23:21:19 i see nothing but stocks being taken all throughout this comment section.
1901 2018-12-22 23:20:41 Isn't that time of year common for stocks to rise due to school getting ready to start and everone getting fresh kicks.
1902 2018-12-22 23:20:41 I bought in trips, Im in no hurry. I've been impatient with stocks like (byoc intv digaf frfs etc.) sold early made great money but not what I could have... frustrating is an understatement! Held strong with Uoip 5mil shares 2500$ turned 265000$.. took a year, but. lol, to d bank
1903 2018-12-22 23:20:21 wala na stocks ih :((
1904 2018-12-22 23:19:58 Nate the economy is the FED doing not Obama, bush or Trump.. all FED.. ur a numbers guy, I’m interested do u play stocks and if so ur favorite indicator?
1905 2018-12-22 23:19:43 I have a neighbor. She was talking about her stocks and I quipped "yep.. stock market had the worst Dec. Since the depression. She sighed, said "I know I'm just sick about it.God I just wish he'd shut his mouth once in a while"
I had to chuckle. She's a strong Trump supporter.
1906 2018-12-22 23:19:14 diversified funds,  dont buy single stocks unless you are super rich or super sure of it.  the market always goes back up.
1907 2018-12-22 23:19:07 Both the CEA and the Fed see no recession, and Wharton’s Jeremy Siegel says stocks are oversold if no recession.
1908 2018-12-22 23:18:45 Its so hard for students here in the Philippines to get CDs & merch like this mainly because its too expensive for our allowance + only limited stocks are available, I would really appreciate it if I'd be able to have this as a gifttt. Ahhh, that would complete my Holiday season!
1909 2018-12-22 23:18:41 The dollar is down 90%. Stocks like amazon and priceline at one point lost 90%+ of their value. On one day apple stock dropped 52%. My conclusion from all these facts is that you're an asshole.
1910 2018-12-22 23:17:36 Nobody said anything about bump stocks or Obama...you’re losing it, bro.
1911 2018-12-22 23:17:22 Stocks go up an escalator and down in an elevator.  It’s a good thing to learn that early but we should hope it doesn’t deter them from investing over the long-term. #grit
1912 2018-12-22 23:17:15 With stocks you have the chance of a company growing to a giant (no matter the the PE). Then again many companies fail. Index seems to be the easiest way to stay on top.
1913 2018-12-22 23:16:31 I’m new to investing into stocks. Are there any suggestions for first timers? Thanks
1914 2018-12-22 23:16:19 Good time at @NYXL today. Had a bunch of foxes in bracket, and I really struggle vs the fast ones. Also ended up choking game 3 up 3 stocks to 1 to get eliminated. Wasn't thinking about the game enough ahhhhhh
1915 2018-12-22 23:15:42 "With cap-weighted indexes, index buyers have no discretion but to load up on stocks that are already overweight (and often pricey) and neglect those already underweight. That's the opposite of buy low, sell high.” 


1916 2018-12-22 23:15:01 True. That is the reason why I pull out Samsung and move out to good US stocks. I think I have a good advisor in twitter. Thx. Let’s keep talking. Glad to know you.
1917 2018-12-22 23:14:29 Dawg like what man if you and Marcus ever did that to me I would never pick up the stocks again
1918 2018-12-22 23:14:24 aah, this game breaks me... i dont know why i still play. I dont enjoy it, get hyped watching footbal i guess. EA is the biggest cunt company in history. I realy hope the stocks are seeing rock bottom.
1919 2018-12-22 23:14:08 La peña que juega con dos stocks en el online se merece la muerte
1920 2018-12-22 23:13:48 @cometisons1zzle: I totally agree! I pay my housekeepers $20 an hour! I treat others the way I would like to be treated. We're all God's children and it's our duty to help others if we can. I bet Trump's fair weather Billionaire friends aren't too happy with the stocks now!
1921 2018-12-22 23:13:01 You showing random numbers for the Stock Exchange! About 90% of Americans don't even do stocks or bond amigo! So how does that help the American public? Ok the other 10% are well off, what about the rest, they care about the BASDAQ AND DOW? Doubt it!
1922 2018-12-22 23:10:58 It's actually possible as a lot of stocks in S&P are zombie companies that their EBIDTA doesn't cover their debt, Corporate Debt Crisis is a real possibility
1923 2018-12-22 23:10:58 You can honestly point to any stock and show the same graph there's no Colin Kapernick effect. Most stocks are way down!
1924 2018-12-22 23:08:24 This government shut down is fucking with my money in stocks so bad. I’m pissed
1925 2018-12-22 23:08:06 Also you make the 10 min unlimited stocks and play it out
1926 2018-12-22 23:08:02 My thoughts avoid stocks altogether. Cash is King
1927 2018-12-22 23:07:58 What's terrible is that the broader stock market never participated in the rally before September but are falling apart along w/ momentum stocks.  Look at the damage done in telecom - CBB (50%), CNSL, CTL - all down at least 30% in 2 weeks.  Some of these pay 15% dividend now.
1928 2018-12-22 23:07:55 Not sure what the rules are in the states but in Australia companies have to be in top 300 / 200 before super funds can buy and there are none that fall into that category . Other funds are buying U stocks buyt the current market sentiment obviously not helping .need > than 30 $
1929 2018-12-22 23:07:52 It's highly concentrated however in hands of wealthiest 1% who hold 84% if memory serves. That shouldn't take away from the millions depending on their stock portfolios (IRAs & 401ks) to save them and you have to remember it's bonds that are more overvalued than stocks this cycle
1930 2018-12-22 23:07:49 Defense stocks are down significantly this week.

That's a sector of the economy I'd be happy to see crater.
1931 2018-12-22 23:04:30 Texas. 

The grid for 90% of the power consumed in Texas is a complete market operated by ERCOT. All producers are connected and distinct from those retailing the power. The retailers (your power company) buy from the producers at the market rate that is bid/offer like stocks.

1933 2018-12-22 23:04:04 The DOW is down 12% so far in December.  Very unusual for stocks to be down in December, so this is doubly ugly.  Republicans and trump's economic and other policies are a disaster.  They have to go.
@GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP
1934 2018-12-22 23:01:35 Let me see your stocks @ODgordo show me yours and I’ll show you mine.
1935 2018-12-22 23:01:00 If you selling your stocks, buy some real estate and start a small business
1936 2018-12-22 23:00:52 Need another Geneva convention for ppl to stop touturing data to make stocks look cheap
1937 2018-12-22 23:00:46 Bitch, stick to Smash 4, and losing by 4 stocks
1938 2018-12-22 23:00:35 Well, it’s a beach...   not a particularly warm beach. Highs in the low 60s most days.
1939 2018-12-22 22:59:55 Stocks at all time highs.... cause rebuilding
1940 2018-12-22 22:58:49 It is. They are using bump stocks
1941 2018-12-22 22:58:38 Would you consider stocks in Google as real? The company's only real product is code (Google Glass was a total failure). 20 years ago many would have argued that there was no value proposition in a search engine.
1942 2018-12-22 22:56:28 Damn this govt my dads stocks dropped 50k this week lmaooo
1943 2018-12-22 22:56:11 OK but is it recency bias based on 10 years of stocks going up? Friend is convinced if you hold you do fine.
1944 2018-12-22 22:54:09 Yeah my stocks are pretty high right now
1945 2018-12-22 22:54:05 Done with shopping back at home..will start updating tomorrow have to rap and stuff updates start at 10am,The Hottest Top 10 Stocks is ready

1947 2018-12-22 22:51:57 How about, a bull wearing a suit because he's working as a broker, and show the stocks
of other New York college teams or really just Syracuse going down. Horns Up 'cause its a Bull Market!
1948 2018-12-22 22:51:25 Kurt, we all know it's just a deflection of all the news of treason by Flynn, inauguration finance fraud by Ivanka, collusion with Russia, free falling stocks (as you said), and quite a few other things as well.
1949 2018-12-22 22:50:02 Corruption. Hahahahaha. W.h. indictments at an all time high, guilty pleas all time high,  sex trafficking defeated???  No still going on.   We are NOT winning the tariff battles.  800 billion pledged for farmers due to tariffs... worst December stocks since 1931, failure looms.
1950 2018-12-22 22:49:26 The bigger question is do you stay in the US? The magats have given all to idiocy. Stocks crashed & burned, Env sold off, racists in charge, Putin controls our military, devos ruining education....& on & on.
1951 2018-12-22 22:49:08 Do whatever you wish; my preference is for real stocks and real estate. I don't gamble and I don't speculate.
1952 2018-12-22 22:48:11 Yup there’s many of these, like my elderly father. It’s been coldly eye-opening how clearly he doesn’t gaf about corruption, rights violations, facts etc, bc tax cut & stocks (were) up. But Trump insulting Tillerson gets him mad. Yeah advancing senility but that’s not 100% cause.
1953 2018-12-22 22:47:14 A confluence of factors have aligned to lift Gold prices this quarter. Volatility in stocks, bonds and commodities - often fanned by flaring trade tensions - has driven some market participants into Gold, a popular destination for nervous investors.
1954 2018-12-22 22:47:07 worst week on wall street since 2008 -stocks down for the year - Wages flat - tax scam all went to stock buy backs - no trickle down - farmers bankrupt from trade war - Obama created more jobs month by month - deficit out of control - rising interest rates stifling growth
1955 2018-12-22 22:45:43 Is this the same investors that were canvassed about how stocks would react should he get elected back in 2016?  I’m gonna guess there’s a decent overlap there. In which case pay no attn
1956 2018-12-22 22:43:49 @Starbucks I guess Howard Schultz retires in the whole fucking company goes to shit we should have known I can't wait until your stocks start falling because of your shity customer service and your inability to train your staff
1957 2018-12-22 22:43:45 “Mom when stocks go down i make money”. She doesn’t understand im a professional short seller thinks im losing money  such a sweetheart.
1958 2018-12-22 22:43:43 I’m not an academic either, just a humble trader with a 2 week thesis that IF stocks rally from around these levels oil will go along for the ride...
1959 2018-12-22 22:42:27 You should add another box: The company should be privatized with stocks offered for purchase by the public
1960 2018-12-22 22:42:04 That's what will break the back of "stocks for the long run" crowd and render all of the pension plans and Bogleheads insolvent for retirement. Most don't understand that secular bear markets (1970s; 1930s) are not survivable--90% real drawdowns that take decades to come back.
1961 2018-12-22 22:41:21 Mr.Graham, enjoy your last term as Senator. We are taking names. I heard Sears is hiring, oh wait they are failing. GM is hiring, oh wait they just layed off 14,000 People. You could buy/sell stocks, oh wait the stock market has crashed in December. Sorry. @realDonaldTrump
1962 2018-12-22 22:40:42 I think the economy is fine. Job growth at its highest level in years, tax cuts, and an administration that is more America first. Stocks are like real estate, they go up down. 2 out of the 4 homes I have fluctuate on a yearly bases.
1963 2018-12-22 22:40:12 How has your stock options trading been this week? #optionstrading #stocks #wallstreet #investing
1964 2018-12-22 22:39:18 Shave his head, put him in the stocks and pelt him with all the fruit rotting in the fields.
1965 2018-12-22 22:39:10 He just put a ban on bump stocks but the media didn’t tell u did they? Hey Nick I didn’t know u were an establishment republican, pro war in Afghanistan supporter. Us democrats have been trying to bring troops home for 17 years. I give this president credit. I’m honest
1966 2018-12-22 22:37:40 -stocks in free fall
-Our top security leaders leaving in droves.
-Syria now left for ISIS to reclaim.
-Government shutdown.

Trumps Christmas gift to all.
1967 2018-12-22 22:37:36 The etf fell much kore than implied by stocks and underlying assets.  In the end fundamental and arb win but you may have to go through some MTM pain.
1968 2018-12-22 22:37:06 The vast majority of the money they make is from donors and lobbyists, and manipulating their stocks and investments with policy decisions.

Earning a paycheck is irrelevant to them. In the Rich World, you make far more money not working than you do working.
1969 2018-12-22 22:37:02 Just imagine all of the revenue the government could of had for border security if you had not thrown it away to give a huge tax cut to the wealthy who have done nothing but buy back their own stocks with it? How much are we losing a day thanks to you?

NOUS VOUS SOUHAITONS DE TRÈS BONNES FÊTES
1971 2018-12-22 22:35:08 Who the fuck has money for stocks?
1972 2018-12-22 22:34:53 to middle class taxpayers, holding stocks as retirement then-the market is a huge deal.
1973 2018-12-22 22:34:29 Thankfully i am@not scheduled to check my stocks for another month or so. Hopefully it will back up by then...
1974 2018-12-22 22:33:47 Put them in stocks in Departures until Nw Year. (If it is them)
1975 2018-12-22 22:33:24 No those stocks were leftovers from last year.
1976 2018-12-22 22:33:02 Some stocks are bottoming though. Nobody can pick the exact bottom of a PARTICULAR stock. For instance $CVS will probably  bottom at around 60. Not far from here. I'm buying
1977 2018-12-22 22:31:54 Also i went from 80% stock 20% cash to 20% stock 80% cash in sept when charts showed the number of stocks having reasonable gains weekly gains for 4 weeks dropped about 75% . Maybe i should be managing your ceo's investors money.
1978 2018-12-22 22:31:15 and the EU are not managing the waters very well, the stocks are depleting at a alarming rate.
1979 2018-12-22 22:30:02 Put them in the stocks . Let every person saw at their necks
1980 2018-12-22 22:30:01 We will let you know after you release your 5 new stocks in just a few short days.
1981 2018-12-22 22:29:56 You raise interest rates when inflation is becoming problematic. It's not. There is no good reason for them to be raising interest rates at this time. This is clearly intended to monkeyhammer stocks & derail Trump's booming economy to turn public opinion against him.
1982 2018-12-22 22:29:15 No stocks hitting rn. Apple hurting from that China trade non sense 
1983 2018-12-22 22:28:24 Ready???
I was in a national retail store today.
Empty shelves everywhere, sold out of 90% of Christmas items.
And while customers stood there in shock,
employees were putting on all those empty shelves..
Valentine's Day items. 
#ChristmasEveEveEve

#economy
1984 2018-12-22 22:28:24 Very nice chart but not very nice prediction  for stocks...
1985 2018-12-22 22:27:16 Lies lies lies. You lie just like @realDonaldTrump   All Democratic and all Republican senators voted for $1.6 billion of wall funding (100 to 0) which #CadetBoneSpurs agreed to then rejected   Republicans are incapable of governing America. That’s why stocks are collapsing
1986 2018-12-22 22:26:17 In Australia, its the high yielding stocks the oldies love. Its their income in retirement, so add irresponsible Govts here for giving them tax breaks like reclaiming imputation credits paid by the companies. Might be about to change if Labor win and retirees are angry...1/2
1987 2018-12-22 22:25:49 I don't care for bump stocks, I also don't care for spike heels and hair dye. I think none of these things need be be banned and the BATF has overstepped on this.
1988 2018-12-22 22:24:34 Yes, so, banning bump stocks to you is considered tyrannical?
1989 2018-12-22 22:24:06 Items nur, wenn man sich mal zu dritt oder viert ordentlich kloppen und dabei eine Gaudi haben will. Ansonsten Battlefield only ohne items, 3 stocks, 7 Minuten.
1990 2018-12-22 22:22:50 Generals resigning. Stocks falling. Government shutdown. All because of Hillary’s emails.
1991 2018-12-22 22:22:22 A lot of things have looked like 1999 this year (with the notable exception of a federal surplus). 2000 did not go well for tech stocks, and IIRC the IPO window slammed shut pretty hard and fast.

Will 2019 look like 2000?
1992 2018-12-22 22:22:13 Be anxious to see what that does to agriculture stocks. Hmmm ... 
1993 2018-12-22 22:22:10 Christmas Party with SB Fam

1994 2018-12-22 22:21:52 It seems like Trump is coming out of hiding and doing all he can to support Russia. He has lifted sanctions, plans to pull out of Seria and reduction of troops in Afghanistan. All a boon to Russia. With stocks tumbling and the partial shut down of our gov, Trump hurts country.
1995 2018-12-22 22:20:56 WHAT THIS EPISODE HIGHLIGHTS THE IN COMPARABILITY OF ECONOMIC STRATEGIES - SOME BASE THEIR SUCCESS ON STOCKS WHOSE VALUES GOES HIGHER THAN DIVIDENDS EARNINGS & USE OF GOVT APPROVED PRINTING OF MONEY (SINCE END OF GOLD STDS) - PRINT AS MUCH AS THEY NEED - VALUE OF CURRENCY IS FIRM
1996 2018-12-22 22:19:32 the full extent of a bear market. Saying BTC was acting like a store of value is like saying dotcom stocks were a store of value in the 90s bc for a while they at least maintained a minimum value (& soared). Will not waste more time responding to you.
1997 2018-12-22 22:19:22 Gun sales and new gun owners are way up. 
All u drones have is bump stocks. 
Are U Trolls secretly working for the NRA?!?
1998 2018-12-22 22:18:50 I think that is how he wants it.  Outside of stocks unless he shorted them all before throwing the world and the US into chaos.  I think he wants to become dictator.
1999 2018-12-22 22:16:56 How is gold valued? @jimcramer is one nutty guy. I bet he has no fin edu. Stocks are valued by the growth in CFs of products & services marketed by Co’s. If we hv a recession, the stock market will correct. But gold will rise to heaven? Stick w quality stocks. Good time to buy!
2000 2018-12-22 22:16:47 US stocks continued slide on 12/21/18 and S&P 500 gave back about 2%, while Fund One gave back about 1% and ended at $109.12 a share.
2001 2018-12-22 22:16:35 C'est sûr les policiers ils ne pensent que a vider les stocks de lacrymogènes... Y a que cette raison pour laquelle ils en lancent...
2002 2018-12-22 22:16:26 I got the lowest bonus ever this year at the same time the company’s stocks plummeted in the worst stock market since the Great Depression. Then this idiot President shuts down the govt. Time for Trump to GTFOH! #TrumpResign
2003 2018-12-22 22:16:05 Just bought some more Disney and weed stocks . Before inflation 
2004 2018-12-22 22:15:51 Given Adam’s oil/stock correlation thesis (both topped on the same day), would mean we’d likely see a tradable rally in stocks too...
2005 2018-12-22 22:15:40 @FrankCurzio Hey Frank, started listening to your podcast for the past couple of weeks and I want to thank you for the education you've already given me. I have a real rookie question: Where should I go (platform wise) to start investing in stocks?
2006 2018-12-22 22:15:06 Our grand parents used to buy 100 shares of a stock, our parents bought single shares of stocks, we are expected to now buy “fractions” of assets.  
Do I need to explain what is taking place here ???
2007 2018-12-22 22:14:59 Guillotte manufacturing stocks are a bull market. #letthemeatcake

2011 2018-12-22 22:13:33 Quirky stocks
2012 2018-12-22 22:13:31 I pretty much live in constant low-level subconscious terror of being homeless and hungry again. Just went over the pantry and freezer food stocks, checked to make sure all bills are paid up, and worked out a budget to get me (barely) through up to 2 months with no paycheck.
2013 2018-12-22 22:12:59 Pretty sure stocks will look attractive to big players now, uncle Warren is sitting on shit loads of cash.
2014 2018-12-22 22:12:57 Hey guys, any idea who stocks a nice big box of your bikkies? I need one for a present and haven't found any.
2015 2018-12-22 22:11:02 Truth! Labas nalang sana ng stocks.
2016 2018-12-22 22:09:40 I did the same with my stocks. Ended the year with 121% gain and got out. Nice year. Glad I didn't stay in.
2017 2018-12-22 22:09:26 You’re fasho on the list for most improved goat after yo bday. Stocks been rising
2018 2018-12-22 22:09:13 My mom always stocks them up for Christmas, she’s knows me way too well 
2019 2018-12-22 22:08:42 1. Society likes to focus on the E part in the formula. It’s unclear to me that we have any other/better way to measure wealth. 

2. We know the companies who issued the stock didn’t lose anything. Investors who currently own the stocks are the losers in this current cycle.
2020 2018-12-22 22:08:13 You can think what you want. I’m a lifetime NRA member and a believer in the 2A. What I don’t believe is to blindly follow doctrine that doesn’t make practical sense in 2018. Bump stocks are not essential to 2A.I can’t defend an attachment that does nothing but increase firepower
2021 2018-12-22 22:08:08 US stocks had their worst week since the George W. recession, our Defense Secretary quit because of Trump's ludicrous Syria pullout and the government was shut down just in time for Christmas.

But Trump is proud. So is Putin. #ResignTrump #TrumpChristmasShutdown
2022 2018-12-22 22:05:51 As they'll never get a custodial sentence, how about building some stocks in both Gatwick terminals and permanently housing the drone 'flyers' there?  
2023 2018-12-22 22:05:27 @JimSterling Are you going to do any videos about the state of the AAA Publishers and their stocks falling off a cliff (I mean everyone is, but Activision/EA are down 50%).
2024 2018-12-22 22:05:22 Nope. You’re wrong. I shall be going for stocks of @burningskybeer and @abyssbrewing  Both local and awesome.
2025 2018-12-22 22:04:58 Had the stocks not tanked that day, the dovish Fed narrative would have gripped on. Powell was dovish but his response during QnA - "policy does not need to be accommodative right now" killed it. Fed speakers will continue to maintain dovish stance for at least next few weeks.
2026 2018-12-22 22:04:53 Hanti kule depot ye fuel ema industry, that's where he stocks it then uses jojo tanks.
2027 2018-12-22 22:03:38 too early for a victory lap since we are still 400% up over 2yr period and +750% over 3yrs. Over 3 years subsidized stocks made only 20%, such wow, #bitcoin is volatile and thus longterm play
2028 2018-12-22 22:03:01 Let's see... I bet we have other things in common.

I absolutely support all marriage equality. That it is even still a question is ludicrous to me. 

I support all common sense gun control, and am thrilled about the ban on bump stocks.

I am against the death penalty. 100%.
2029 2018-12-22 22:02:06 i only use apple products to check stocks
2030 2018-12-22 22:01:57 Looking ahead - weeks/months. In my universe of potential stocks I have 38 that currently meet by base criteria - multi year / flat top. 10 are Biotech, easily the most represented industry. Keep an eye to see if Biotechs lead the next advance
2031 2018-12-22 22:01:00 You STOLE the 2016 election & you lost the house in 2018. Third government shutdown this year, stocks plummeting, the only adult left the WH, indictments galore, SDNY breathing down your neck. Yep so much winning. RESIGN NOW.
2032 2018-12-22 22:00:28 Just to remind you all that the shop will be open Sunday 23rd Dec from 11.30am till 3.30pm. Please come down and avoid the queues. There is still good stocks of vegetables and fruits. See you there
2033 2018-12-22 21:59:59 Buy steel stocks, insider trading nah nah bullshits
2034 2018-12-22 21:59:31 Or his hatred towards the rich. Even telling some poor people to fuck themselves b/c they own stocks because the rich own them too
2035 2018-12-22 21:58:33 They have in the past and will do again, since there's no alternative, no third solution for investing. Not just physical Gold but Gold stocks as well.
2036 2018-12-22 21:58:23 Agree with Max. The storm is coming and it’s time to adopt a defensive position by ditching stocks, bonds and fiat.
2037 2018-12-22 21:56:37 Let me guess is he blaming Powell for stocks tanking?
2038 2018-12-22 21:56:35 @CNN @StephenMoore @foxandfriends Ridiculous statement from Stephen Moore saying that it’s great that stock market is down so we can “buy low”.  When you need groceries to feed your kids, a mortgage to pay & gas for your car to get to work...yea, not buying stocks. #Elitist
2039 2018-12-22 21:56:32 Stocks dropped due to increased rate and uncertainty of what the libs will do. Stocks is not a tru indicator of economic strength.  Keep living ur socialist dreams that have failed globally
2040 2018-12-22 21:56:31 Who wants to make extra money by adding an app to their phone or free stocks? DM for details. It’s LEGIT, no scams.
2041 2018-12-22 21:55:14 selling of stocks is not productive either. in fact mass speculation is one of the ways modern economics became this esoteric exercise in abstraction that destroys the planet and fucks workers over while still pretending to be this exact science of inescapable forces. (...)
2042 2018-12-22 21:55:10 Jesse, please only take suggestions from your female followers. She does not want pliers or bump stocks. Trust me. And stop calling her your ball and chain, for cryin’ out loud.
2043 2018-12-22 21:54:22 We are near retirement and hubby says the stocks will be back and not to worry. I never listen to him.
2044 2018-12-22 21:53:20 People buy stocks to sell them at a later time. Do you have a sell price target? Do you think it is higher or lower than the majority of current holders? All things to consider in your capital holding analysis.
2045 2018-12-22 21:52:40 Haha you’re still calling for a bounce while the stocks RIP lower.
2046 2018-12-22 21:49:57 In the past, bubbles once popped, we went to the other side of the spectrum. Valuations went below historical norms after 1929, for example. This didn't happen in 2002 or 2008.  People never really quit believing in stocks. The next bear market might last a much longer time.
2047 2018-12-22 21:49:30 au the contraire, banana republics are banana republics precisely because that is what popular vote leads societies over time, while the electoral college arises from an association between states with an agreed number of stocks on the federal government
2048 2018-12-22 21:49:12 Is that why your friends are buying up steel stocks?
Getting your pals an xmas bonus, eh?

2049 2018-12-22 21:47:35 I'm already short-selling their stocks!
2050 2018-12-22 21:47:18 Lastnight I dreamt I came up a quarter M in these stocks.. soon to come ,,,
2051 2018-12-22 21:46:49 My Christmas beer stocks are running a bit low.  I might have to pop into @Symposium_Wine for supplies.
2052 2018-12-22 21:46:41 People don't give Trump enough credit. I give him credit for doing something about bump stocks and this is his shutdown. #TrumpShutdown He's totally in charge not anybody else. He's the one messing up our country.
2053 2018-12-22 21:46:35 Take advantage of the market drop and buy stocks
2054 2018-12-22 21:46:00 Don’t your scalp get cold in the wintertime? The Dems say no and the sun don’t shine. It’s hard, but your “base” might decide not to stay..
Stocks losing all your highs just low. And your impeachment’s just a heartbeat away....oh...
2055 2018-12-22 21:45:19 If you eat some kale between stocks
2056 2018-12-22 21:43:37 My dog is a financial analyst and has been playing the stocks and reading since 2004
2057 2018-12-22 21:43:06 As I think you've noted before.. the real puzzler here is: if this is such a slam dunk why the hell aren't U stocks being bought up by funds and sophs like they're going out of style?
2058 2018-12-22 21:42:38 Senior Justice Dept. officials told Whitaker signing gun regulation might prompt successful challenge to his appointment. So what?  If Whitaker did not sign off on banning bump stocks, and automatic weapons, he would have caused many deaths due to  gun crazy psychopaths.
2059 2018-12-22 21:42:38 With all of this talk of a shutdown, do not lose sight of the progress of the Mueller investigation, the slump in the stocks, and the resignation of many top level officials and recent climate change reports. These are all very important stories that have moved to the background
2060 2018-12-22 21:42:33 I'm having a blast playing Pichu. Am I winning games? Not really; I'm giving over half of my stocks away due to SD's and overextensions, but man am I having fun. Their combo potential  is unreal and their off stage is incredible. Dare to dair!
#SmashBrosUltimate
2061 2018-12-22 21:42:20 "Working hard"???? Usually those who really ARE hard workers don't need to mention it. The work speaks for itself. Stocks in free fall, government shutdown....yeah...you're working really hard.
2062 2018-12-22 21:42:04 If you want to invest in Nigerian bonds, treasury bills and other decent stocks with utter ease, download & use TRADEFI.
2063 2018-12-22 21:42:01 Where do you think the tax cuts will be made, medicare, medicaid, social security, food programs. BTW trickle down BS never works, companies are using all the tax cut money to buy back stocks & pass money on to shareholders.
2064 2018-12-22 21:41:09 I understood @brunicharting to be buying individual stocks here.
Averaging into funds/indices a much different decision-making process. And not a bad idea here at all.

And sounding ridiculous is not a bad thing. It got u to listen and interact on this important topic.
2065 2018-12-22 21:40:46 $IQ stop complaining. Look athe FANG stocks if you feel like shit. They are worse off
2066 2018-12-22 21:40:24 I'll give him credit for bump stocks. Sooo glad to see that coming. Just about everything else is motivated by greed and the need for attention. There is very little good in what he has done including the climate change issue
2067 2018-12-22 21:39:39 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
2068 2018-12-22 21:38:55 If Donnie @realDonaldTrump thinks there's chaos now, watch would happen if he tried to fire Powell.   Vol would explode, dollar would gap lower, stocks 5-10% lower. It would be the political risk everyone has discounted being uncorked.
2069 2018-12-22 21:37:50 It’s laughable that the trump administration banned bump stocks but yet binary triggers are still legal.
2070 2018-12-22 21:37:24 Typical corp America shipping jobs to China, Stocks down cause of tariffs on those same companies that shipped jobs to China, Tax cut for the rich and those same companies that shipped jobs to China, Jobs shipped to China and robotization. GOP was in back of all this!
2071 2018-12-22 21:37:10 Snuggle stocks down 43% we are now in correction territory
2072 2018-12-22 21:37:09 I’m playing Inklings. I took stocks but I didn’t know how to get out of disadvantage or stuff out his approaches.
2073 2018-12-22 21:36:58 When I heard the news, I purchased "BRAC" (nasdeq),my  first significant stock purchase since I got out of the market in 2017.  I have absolute faith that this new merger will be a milestone for entertainment/sports stocks.  It's my Duckman stock tip for the new year!
2074 2018-12-22 21:36:54 Stocks don’t always have to go up, they just need to accurately reflect the underlying asset values.
2075 2018-12-22 21:35:39 It was around 8.30pm. It would have been better if the staff were advised to keep stocks topped up instead of waiting until they sold out, but the staff that were stocking up were working hard.
2076 2018-12-22 21:35:33 Oh boy..when only we can explain random people why he/ she should buy Litecoin instead of Apple stocks ( or any other) then we have something. I have been a holder since 2013. Remember
2077 2018-12-22 21:35:17 Lol how those stocks doing?
2078 2018-12-22 21:34:13 Get the old stocks in the Boxing Day sales and the new ones printed tonight 
2079 2018-12-22 21:33:59 There are quality stocks now with PE ratios of 8 that average 12. There is your 50% hit to earnings.

2081 2018-12-22 21:31:55 With there now being an official shutdown, 800,000 Federal employees don't get paychecks.
You know how they will pay their bills?
BY SELLING THEIR STOCK HOLDINGS.
Monday will be an ugly day for stocks. Guaranteed.
And it is because of Donald Trump

2083 2018-12-22 21:30:29 Needless to say his base is filled with morons who don't own stocks.
2084 2018-12-22 21:30:29 Je zou er versteld van staan wat voor oude brol er nog in de stocks liggen. Ik heb zelfs al 1o1's gehad van mijn geboortejaar.
2085 2018-12-22 21:29:48 Soros always argued reflexivity meant stocks prices contribute to, rather than merely reflect, underlying economic conditions. Would be interesting to know to what extent recent econ slowdown is being caused by weak financial markets (reduced confidence & access to funding).
2086 2018-12-22 21:29:34 Okay nevermind I lost to a Zard who spammed side special for one of my entire stocks when he started at 50% and he won the game I'm fucking garbage
2087 2018-12-22 21:27:54 Out of stocks
2088 2018-12-22 21:26:57 @vueling hola! ¿No tienes stocks para cada vuelo? Estábamos en las filas del medio, y había más de un sándwich y casi ninguna bebida. El precio pagado es un poco embarazoso. Número de vuelo: VY3287
2089 2018-12-22 21:26:48 Stocks go up and down we will survive.
The stocks are falling due to federal reserve raising interest rates against the president's advice and the peoples wishes.
They need to fight like other countries did and survived. My ancestors fought against the savage Turks
2090 2018-12-22 21:26:14 I definitely got lucky with my original Canopy trade, no doubt about that.  If you take out pot stocks I'm probably around the average, 10% annually or less.  Not sure exactly though to be honest what the accumulative number is.
2091 2018-12-22 21:24:42 Most retail people have zero participation in PE and leveraged loans, all about RE, stocks and crypto to a lesser extent

Deficit climbing, stuck in trade war, stocks falling, alliances in tatters, administration posts unfilled, mistrust abounds due to lies, Mueller revealing misdeeds, democracy undermined in GA, WI, MI, & NC, climate science ignored, shootings & hate crimes at record levels
2093 2018-12-22 21:22:42 Explain stocks, house flipping, & investing in general then
2094 2018-12-22 21:22:38 Don't buy any penny stocks. They are all scams
2095 2018-12-22 21:20:52 Sure they did, part of the year stocks went up
2096 2018-12-22 21:20:06 RT @adamcbest: "Hi, I'm a Trump voter! Because the wall. Instead of getting it, the trade war cost me my job, my stocks tanked & my healthcare premiums exploded. That's ok. I know the great orange business god has a plan. So I'm spending my own money to fund the wall. MAGA!"
2097 2018-12-22 21:18:33 Bring back the stocks and lock them in them at Gatwick !!
2098 2018-12-22 21:17:47 If Trump fires Powell we gonna have a total market caos, or a bull market with skyrocketing stocks? I’m in doubt, but I could bet stocks to climb if it happens...
2099 2018-12-22 21:16:46 Trump Slump: December is generally the strongest time of the year for US stocks. Traders often talk about a ‘‘Santa rally’’ that adds to the year’s gains as people adjust their portfolios in anticipation of the year to come.

But not this year.
2100 2018-12-22 21:15:15 *shorbie enters the nest* has just informed me about bit coin stocks
2101 2018-12-22 21:13:39 apple stocks rise by 35%.
2102 2018-12-22 21:12:56 Trump Slump: December is generally the strongest time of the year for US stocks. Traders often talk about a ‘‘Santa rally’’ that adds to the year’s gains as people adjust their portfolios in anticipation of the year to come.

2104 2018-12-22 21:11:36 @realDonaldTrump @stevenmnuchin1 we suspect the recent brutal selloff in US stocks may be a coordinated assault on our market & well being. Possibly China? Please look at it.
2105 2018-12-22 21:11:12 Good for you but I seriously doubt the majority of people can't say the same. My stocks grew exponentially under Obama. Besides, the stock market is down hundreds of points  lately under Trump. That is a fact.
2106 2018-12-22 21:10:36 Bitcoin or stocks?
2107 2018-12-22 21:10:04 Show me proof lol I don’t use stocks tf
2108 2018-12-22 21:09:34 I will always be grateful to @latha_venkatesh maam. She creates an extreme panic which helps me buying stocks at rock bottom price. You’re a legend!
2109 2018-12-22 21:09:07 Agree it’s a buy, but recently many stocks have fallen sharply (URG, DNN to say a couple of examples in the U space I follow, without mentioning other sectors like oil&gas...) so it’s hard to decide where to add some of our very scarce capital!
2110 2018-12-22 21:08:33 @nvidia I have your stocks. Don't let me down boyz.
2111 2018-12-22 21:06:36 Many Americans have retirement income linked to stocks. Anything else?
2112 2018-12-22 21:06:04 Here comes the Trump Slump:
+ Worst week in stocks since financial crisis of 2008
+ Worst December since the Great Depression
+ Tariff Man’s policies hurting industry and global trade
+ Government shutdown #TrumpChristmasShutdown2018. #NOWallEver
2113 2018-12-22 21:06:02 Stocks See Their Worst Month in a Decade, Are Cryptos to Blame?
2114 2018-12-22 21:05:28 Here comes the Trump Slump:
+ Worst week in stocks since financial crisis of 2008
+ Worst December since the Great Depression
+ Tariff Man’s policies hurting industry and global trade
+ Government shutdown #TrumpChristmasShutdown2018.       #NoWall
2115 2018-12-22 21:04:49 Just based on preference or matchup. Characters I can cheese offstage I opt for Isabelle, characters that I need to focus on zoning out or if I need to take stocks consistently I opt for Villager.
2116 2018-12-22 21:04:03 Best time for fund managers to dump stocks is when anyone excepts a Xmas rally! Well played 
2117 2018-12-22 21:03:34 Sold my JC Penney stocks
2118 2018-12-22 21:01:12 lol, another nugget  of wisdom written by a guy that never met a war he didn't like.  people are rejecting your way of thinking.  we want to stop throwing our children's futures away so your defense stocks keep going up.  how many veterans a day commit suicide?  you don't care.
2119 2018-12-22 21:00:49 1/2 The key is debt for me. Debt robs demand from the future. The higher the debt, the more demand robbed. World debt is at a level where no country can generate the cash to pay it down and in most cases have a budget surplus. that has led to outsized profits and stocks valued..
2120 2018-12-22 21:00:24 The fools that have been convinced market doesn’t impact 401Ks have listened to Trump and his goons too long. Tried explain to a fool how his Target fund follows the S&P Index and his response was “I don’t have stocks”. No, but his fund sure does! Trump University I guess?
2121 2018-12-22 21:00:01 Muling nagbabalik pure onepiece swimsuit in one bale!!!  few stocks only 
2122 2018-12-22 20:58:43 And this was about bump stocks someone could get just as many people without if they really wanted care to say anything else ?
2123 2018-12-22 20:58:42 My cycle is so bonkers irregular I should have taken out stocks in a pregnancy test company years ago - hence the surprise.
2124 2018-12-22 20:57:54 Time to run the federal reserve to benefit trump. Let’s have another decade of 0% interest rates so those who want to save but can’t afford to play the stock market make absolutely nothing. I’m betting a lot of trump’s base aren’t investing in stocks.
2125 2018-12-22 20:57:37 DEMOCRATS ARE BACK AT WORK AS YOU CAN TELL!

THATS WHY STOCKS ARE DOWN SO MUCH.

IT SHOWS DOESNT IT???
2126 2018-12-22 20:57:27 You hold stocks in the corporations accelerating a climate-change induced mass extinction. While our children will inhabit a doomed oven, you’ll be in your grave having enjoyed a gluttonously affluent life not having suffered the effects of your decisions. Shut up.
2127 2018-12-22 20:57:02 Is it odd i got so happy that i figured out finally how to chart a future with stockbot in Discord? i've charted stocks, but could not figure out how to chart $NQ_F or $ES_F and finally figured it out today after i actually did some real research into it, lol
2128 2018-12-22 20:55:50 I want to learn about stocks
2129 2018-12-22 20:55:21 The view here is that sentiment indicators do not add value. E.g. during the '98 bear market, the equity put/call ratio exceeded 1.0 -- a level some viewed as a line in the sand -- about seven or eight times before the market finally bottomed. #stocks
2130 2018-12-22 20:55:05 Lower taxes for who ? Obama gave a middle class tax break. You are so F'n bitter you didn't see your blessings.....That tax break was for the top 10% who took that savings and re- invested into their stocks and dividends....not employees, we have a bleak 2019, bud...Check ur 401K
2131 2018-12-22 20:55:01 I think you'll find we screwed fishermen.
You do know EU tried to have policy to encourage local fleets (whilst preserving stocks)? Farage never went to meetings, and our government enabled us selling our quotas abroad against EU recommendation
But easier to blame the evil EU
2132 2018-12-22 20:54:51 Thank you. That means a lot coming from you. We have a university investment competition where they can trade anything, but the challenge in my course is focused on the fundamentals of stocks. It's a great experience for students, though. 

Merry Christmas!
2133 2018-12-22 20:54:14 'Hyping' perhaps, but are you saying that retirees should not own stocks at all? Just wondering?
2134 2018-12-22 20:53:05 "Paul Rieck, business guy. I do stocks and synergy"
*wins 80% of the vote"
2135 2018-12-22 20:52:54 I don’t think trump owns much if any stocks     He hated the market (called it’s bubble) at Dow 16,000
2136 2018-12-22 20:52:11 Friend asked for suggestions for her 9mo old. I told her to buy him some stocks or bonds. I wasn’t kidding.
2137 2018-12-22 20:52:06 The S&P 500 had an annualized simple price return of -2.72% from December 31, 1999 to December 31, 2009.

Stocks don't go up in value forever, but Bitcoin through its scarcity possibly could, NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE
2138 2018-12-22 20:51:36 Now the market has another overhang. Do you want to be in the market and long stocks the day that Trump fires Powell?  Lots of black swans out there!
2139 2018-12-22 20:51:13 Stock market not doing well this week, gotta ride it out. Ironically most of my $ is on @Twitter stocks haha,
2140 2018-12-22 20:51:08 LIKE TRUMP SAID WHEN THE HOUSING MARKET WENT BUST, HE CAN BUY UP A BUNCH OF HOMES.  HE'S THINKING ALONG THESE SAME LINES NOW WITH THE STOCKS I BET!
2141 2018-12-22 20:51:03 I’m not buying gold. It goes down with stocks
2142 2018-12-22 20:50:27 every major recession will be proceeded by a big fall in stocks, but the opposite is not necessarily true. SPX down from the highs but up 15% (plus divs) from 2 years ago. IMO 2400-2600 seems pretty reasonable, the weird thing was the path that crossed 2950 on the way!
2143 2018-12-22 20:50:17 I don’t think stocks go up if a lunatic president fires a competent fed chair. But I didn’t see stocks rising the first year of a lunatic president, so you’re probably right.
2144 2018-12-22 20:49:56 He was a pilot. He could have killed more with his plane or controlled fire. Bump stocks make rifles inaccurate.
2145 2018-12-22 20:49:18 1- Hedge funds/pension plans got caught off guard long equity exposure, God knows why after 10 years of economic expansion, their asset allocation model BROKE. Margin/Debt/Interest Bubble. Grand INDEXING Bubble the markets ignored as new money feed into pushing up stocks.
2146 2018-12-22 20:48:34 I’m actually being serious I love it because once it hits rock bottom ya boy is going to exploit the demise and buy stocks at a waaaay lower price then reap the gains
2147 2018-12-22 20:47:58 It will certainly earn the stock market gurus a lot of billions from falling stocks. The lockdown is just another gimmick.
2148 2018-12-22 20:47:09 The point is, is we are in a earnings bubble and stocks go far lower than expected because so many don't see that part of the equation
2149 2018-12-22 20:47:00 I don't mind being wrong. I like good dialogue and honest discussion. Its how I learn and grow. And I understand the importance of diversification. Looking forward to see if these stocks can start 'budding' lol
2150 2018-12-22 20:46:35 Who else has correlated @realDonaldTrump tweets with a direct loss of your stocks?  The self proclaimed stable genius is single handedly ruining my retirement. Worst performance since 1931 and sure the idiot in chief is proud he has the power to do so
2151 2018-12-22 20:45:34 75% más de cheques rechazados en Noviembre en comparación a 2017, 260.000 automóviles acumulan en stocks las teminales, ventas minoristas tuvieron una caída del 15.6% con respecto a 2017 (malo de x si). Los voté y los volvería a votar pero no se transformen en la mierda q se fue
2152 2018-12-22 20:44:56 Yes! This week he got a farm bill, criminal justice reform, wind downs in Syria and Afghanistan, and a ban on bump stocks. I think everyone can find something positive there, apart from his toxic personality.
2153 2018-12-22 20:44:56 you think I have “music” playing in my airpods? Try an audio class on the best stocks to buy in 2019 
2154 2018-12-22 20:44:46 Half the people in USA own stocks either directly or through their retirement accounts...we need to be all over trump to resign or to get the republicans in congress to impeach him...or we're all screwed  @GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @TheDemCoalition
2155 2018-12-22 20:44:03 C est des vieix stocks. J crois pas qu ils en fabriquent encore
2156 2018-12-22 20:43:37 Magee Mor Matthew, a rugged rough rugheaded kern, in strossers with
a buttoned codpiece, his nether stocks bemired with clauber of ten
forests, a wand of wilding in his hand.

Your own?
2157 2018-12-22 20:42:59 You shut down the government against the will of the MAJORITY of Americans. At CHRISTMAS! — Mattis left because of Syria and stocks are plummeting. — And you really think we’re gonna let those “poorly educated” followers of yours re-elect you?
2158 2018-12-22 20:42:46 Anyone familiar and very knowledgeable in stocks/investments??
2159 2018-12-22 20:42:44 Main reason stocks are tanking is trump and republicans in congress who defend of trump's crimes...USA lost all credibility throughout world...if trump remains in power, we will go into a horrible recession
@GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP
2160 2018-12-22 20:42:28 Perhaps he is also signalling his buddies and family to short stocks so they make a fortune while America suffers. He telegraphs everything and be interesting to see how his friends and family are benefitting,
2161 2018-12-22 20:41:25 So bump stocks are banned, but Parkinson's is still legal? Smh America. Think about the children!
2162 2018-12-22 20:40:43 Okay you keeping mentioning safety. Who are you grabbing with the early pick let alone mid? Dynasty isn’t about winning with safety it’s about taking the gamble. Buying stocks low selling high ect.
2163 2018-12-22 20:40:27 Exactly. We the people are not smart. This is why where we are today. Look what the corporations who got big tax cuts are doing! They haven't shared the windfalls with their rank and file employees. They are buying back the stocks and sitting on it. @SpeakerRyan
2164 2018-12-22 20:40:21 Ha, no, we asked students to buy only individual stocks. I just told them how to short last week in my final mini-lecture. One student did tell me that he traded forex instead of stocks, though! Genius!
2165 2018-12-22 20:40:20 Closing bells ring, are you listening
On Wall Street, stocks are slipping
A terrible fright
We're crying tonight
Watching our markets crashland.
Gone away are our investments
Here to stay is a depressment
#Trump was so wrong
To boast all along
While our markets crashland.
2166 2018-12-22 20:39:57 anyone notice stock market.  you know sorros has to be behind stocks going down... it has been predicted 2019 may be a crash!! watch market end of December.  It will be blamed on Trump.
2167 2018-12-22 20:39:53 Nope. You cant. Do you like borders being secured, unemployment being lowest ever, oh and he banned bump stocks. All things you should be happy about.
2168 2018-12-22 20:39:02 If President Trump insists on everything, then fist support at 2,200-second 1,650-last 800 or lower! Stay long SPXS 3x's bear fund. #Stocks #SPXS #Invest
2169 2018-12-22 20:37:56 He might be able to pull even more unreactable situations and tech chases to secure stocks and position himself better with landing aerials. Crossing up with jumps might be less of a commitment now, but it still is regardless.

Tomahawks by attack cancel jumping over shields 
2170 2018-12-22 20:36:21 So are your stocks & 401k. Money keeps disappearing like it’s one of trumps charities.
2171 2018-12-22 20:36:10 No, 99% of traders don't know how to trade or what to do during market events.

They will sell early. 

Proven fact and something I have seen first-hand through trading stocks and forex.
2172 2018-12-22 20:35:12 Government partial shutdown, stocks down, U.S respect all but gone from international communities, but Trumps biggest impact will be the massive brain drain from our government.
2173 2018-12-22 20:35:07 Interesting thought, but not easily provable/disprovable. To the original tweet, since the economy has grown faster than wages over the past 40 or so years (bullshit, I think we’ll agree). Though stocks are a way for the avg person to participate, can be bumpy in the short term
2174 2018-12-22 20:34:27 The debt going first, nelnet and sally Mae can kiss my ass first. Stocks and property next, then getting the hell on.
2175 2018-12-22 20:33:36 You have to judge the speed of Ultimate, though. People die much easier in Ultimate than Smash 4, but it doesn’t delete your stocks like Melee can. I think camping/timeouts in tournaments suck, so 8 minutes removes that factor
2176 2018-12-22 20:33:17 Melania is pissed at Individual #1, so she wants to be alone, her stocks tanked. 
2177 2018-12-22 20:33:05 If you give them your bump stocks then they will have all of the bump stocks. This is the exact same thing that happened in Nazi Germany when Hitler made everyone turn in their guns. And we know #LasVegasShooting was a False Flag incident too.
2178 2018-12-22 20:32:53 Accuracy is EXCELLENT at point blank range
All I can see from this is that the guns with retracting shoulder stocks are more accurate than the one without
2179 2018-12-22 20:32:13 I specified bump stocks not guns. Reread
2180 2018-12-22 20:30:34 Sure that’s what he said, but he also has lost alot on his China stocks.  And while I know he wasn’t a proponent of QE, I don’t remember him writing any Wall Street editorials strongly against it or how it causes wealth disparity.
2181 2018-12-22 20:29:06 While waiting for America to be great again, I lost respect for this country, my stocks retirement have taken a huge hit & we were in better hands before 45 became president.
2182 2018-12-22 20:29:01 $SPX Fun fact: The S&P 500 Index is now -17.83% lower through Friday from its all-time high 3 months ago on Sept. 21st    $SPY $SLV $GLD $QQQ $DJIA $DIA $BTC $ETH $TLT #stockmarket #commodities #investing #finance #stocks #gold #silver $FB $TWTR $AAPL $AMZN $TSLA $INTC $AMD $NFLX
2183 2018-12-22 20:28:43 Wow, @POTUS .  The ONLY stock that’s not tanking is Nike!  Stocks at all time low since 2008.  Care to comment?
2184 2018-12-22 20:26:54 Of course it can't. The GOP doesn't care about our safety and never has. They are just raising this now because stocks are down.
2185 2018-12-22 20:26:51 It has been interesting though, suddenly his most rabid supporters have become anti-war. They should be rushing to turn in their bump stocks too. You have to wonder what else he can get them to support.
2186 2018-12-22 20:26:14 Most pension funds are neck deep in stocks, because it is the only thing they know how to do, they are bleeding money like crazy, but my crypto pension depends on my trading skills, so can't blame anyone if I loose it all:))
2187 2018-12-22 20:25:44 After his trial:

Put him in stocks on SCOTUS steps.

The "T" of his body will be for Treason.
2188 2018-12-22 20:23:02 This month: -12.1%
Sept. 1931: -30.70%

Not all Americans have their wealth invested stocks, and not all Americans have wealth to invest. You only lose money when you sell low.
2189 2018-12-22 20:22:54 the plan:Trump calls Xi , says can end trade war and will give some concessions if Xi pays for his f-cking wall and uses US companies/steel/etc,then calls Schumer says get bi-partisan infrastructure bill passed an then will resign. Stocks make new highs! #resigntrump #trumpresign
2190 2018-12-22 20:22:49 yes, very much so. Finance is not entertainment, its people life savings. Their average viewer is 65+ years old. Hyping stocks into retirement is outrageous and irresponsible.
2191 2018-12-22 20:22:16 i got stuff to do i shouldve been did
i shouldve washed the clothes
i shouldve fed the kids

i shouldve bought some stocks
trade em in
or bought the block
to raise em in

if i did the things im suppose to do
i wouldnt be worried about what i Wanna do

ill do that later
2192 2018-12-22 20:21:50 @realDonaldTrump @NRA @atfhq So now that you have illegally banned bump stocks with ZERO public pressure, you have lost a LOT of your support.  I hate to say it but If you don’t fix this you’ll be one and done like GHWB. Never thought this would happen with a “Pro 2A” POTUS
2193 2018-12-22 20:21:28 Sorry, but I am correct: stocks were not at a high when Obama left office - they skyrocketed the moment Trump took office. They took a dive when Dems took the house. And your "klan" joke? Trump has done more for the black community in 2 years than Obummer ever did.
2194 2018-12-22 20:21:25 despite stock market falling-especially angry in market fall over last three days- worst collapse in stocks since 2008.(4)
2195 2018-12-22 20:21:24 This is so funny

You are still trying to compare -85% range „wannabe currency” with no future,to developed investements.

I am aware of possibilities that #blockchain can give to society, but #BTC is done. It can’t even keep up with other cryptos.

Stocks #permabear speaking
2196 2018-12-22 20:20:19 you aren't kidding. There is a kpop store in Melbourne and a couple of years ago, it was evenly distributed with ALL kpop groups. Now that store stocks a lot of BTS stuff and a lot of the customers have ARMY clothes etc.
2197 2018-12-22 20:20:00 Gaillio we could just update our own gps! It cannot function without our scientists anyway! We have the second best intelligence system in the world! The Eu would be stupid to not want to share it!l! CFP has destroyed our fishing stocks and industry!
2198 2018-12-22 20:19:31 But, he's just getting us OUT of a war! Don't listen to DiFi.  She's just sore that her weapons manufacturing stocks have tanked. Doubt the Afghanis will be attacking us anytime soon.
2199 2018-12-22 20:19:13 My stocks are starting to go DOWN as fuck time to sell my portfolio and buy an AK
2200 2018-12-22 20:18:39 Do you think he'll bring us bump stocks or nah?
2201 2018-12-22 20:17:47 The bad hombres are mostly born here. Nazis, white nationalists, the extremists on both sides and *some bad apples (or a lot) of the NRA zealots who think AKs, semi-automatic weapons or bump stocks are what you hunt with or protect yourself with. #ReasonsNotToBuildTheWall
2202 2018-12-22 20:17:47 Check out the new stock of Fishes and lots of nice plants in stocks ! Great Gifts Idea !
2203 2018-12-22 20:16:22 Guy, I'm not rich, but I got more money in my check.  I have a Degree in Economics.  Stockholders own most major business that hire workers.  The tax cuts increase stocks for 401, and more workers are employeed.  That's why the GDP rose to 3-4%.  It's not all about the rich.
2204 2018-12-22 20:16:16 Stocks are down 20% since September-- and it will only get worse because of the economic effects of global warming

Investing was the primary form of wealth-building for the last 150+ years. I don't know shit but I can't see that continuing. Constant growth is a capitalist lie
2205 2018-12-22 20:15:44 The differences are a financial matter.  Super Late racing is expensive. Late Model Stocks were supposed to be the cheaper alternative, but even that's growing out of control. Pro Lates and Limited Lates are cost effective models. That sentiment applies to every division.
2206 2018-12-22 20:15:30 ok wtv lets cancel that i’ll invest in tesla stocks
2207 2018-12-22 20:15:25 Cuz they correlate stocks’ progress as their country’s progress.
2208 2018-12-22 20:14:55 Don't believe the BS that you hear about those funded accounts they're great and all my members use them it's a great way for underfunded traders to trade proper stocks. necessary evil
2209 2018-12-22 20:13:50 Many stocks near 52 week hi’s coming out of sound bases. For ex, i bot AMED and TWLO out of decent bases recently, but got stopped out for small losses. Tells me the mkt wasnt ready. Mkt even worse now.
2210 2018-12-22 20:13:43 Now Isn’t that the damn truth, the economy is so great, so where are the increases to our flat or no raise paychecks, since the tax break, oh yeah most companies decided to buy back their stocks & keep the profits of @ least 487B. 
2211 2018-12-22 20:13:19 TAX cuts are not working.The tariffs are not keeping any jobs in the United States. In fact we are losing more. Stocks are dropping lower than the Great Depression.We r a laughing stock to the world can’t be trusted. No health plan just gutting what little is left of ACA. MAGA
2212 2018-12-22 20:12:21 He chose to put bump stocks on his guns to exact a deadlier rampage.  Banning bump stocks won't prevent crimes but it may make crimes that occur by gun violence less deadly.  Yes, he did have 23 guns and twelve of them were outfitted with bump stocks.
2213 2018-12-22 20:12:01 We shall see. Only problem is all his stocks run and then dump hard cause of his nonsense.
2214 2018-12-22 20:11:37 If you're the guy playing campy Samus online with 3 stocks 3 minutes set I hope your switch gets stolen because you don't deserve it.
2215 2018-12-22 20:10:26 Could it be possible he’s actually IN the market somehow and purposely encouraging the negative sentiment shorting stocks?
2216 2018-12-22 20:10:19 Why worst possible? Let's say I have 10k gains from selling stocks, I can avoid paying the taxes by simply selling crypto (if at loss currently) and compensate...means I have more to buy back BTC right away. Thanks!
2217 2018-12-22 20:10:12 LOOKS LIKE THE FED HAS WEIGHED IN ON THE DONNIE DO DO SITUATION FOLKS... THEY ARE PISSED ABOUT SOME THINGS AND THEY ARE GOING TO  FINANCIALLY TEAR donald  APART... BOTH HIS  PROPERTY VALUES / STOCKS  AND HIS WHITE HOUSE  LEGACY.... POSSIBLY RIGHT DOWN TO PUTTING US IN A BEAR MKT
2218 2018-12-22 20:09:34 Very nice. But Jaxon, either you hate grat or you love it. Sell or hold. Nothing else to it. Sheldon will always do what he does but you can't deny his stocks run with huge returns.
2219 2018-12-22 20:08:18 After a decade of an incredible bull run, the charts of most US stock indexes look quite unappetizing. Stocks See Their Worst Month in a Decade, Are Cryptos to Blame? What you say @APompliano @markusjayvc ?
2220 2018-12-22 20:08:10 7 mins. I feel 8 mins is a bit much and that’s what melee has with 4 stocks
2221 2018-12-22 20:07:55 @sasonline999 do you have call and trade facility for trading of nifty/bank nifty and cash stocks ? what are your brokerage charges please ?
2222 2018-12-22 20:07:50 Too bad I lost all my bump stocks in a boating accident. :(
2223 2018-12-22 20:07:40 Hussman's mistake (and mine too, but to a much lesser extent) was to underestimate the willingness of the Fed to throw responsible, long-term considerations out the window and instead just print money and/or keep real rates negative. Stocks are priced NOMINALLY.
2224 2018-12-22 20:07:25 I'm lucky my local shop stocks it. Will be buying up all wedges on Monday. Consider it a cheese lock in.
2225 2018-12-22 20:06:03 Prob not anytime soon. Government shut down, end of the year. No one will be willing to buy stocks
2226 2018-12-22 20:05:44 Look this happend under Obama as well. Business as usual. Look government runs the way it does to make government rich richer. Embrace and think about this.
" when the prime rate is high Stocks will die and when the prime rate is low Stocks will grow"  think about it.

2229 2018-12-22 20:04:37 @realDonaldTrump @NRA @ATFHQ  Now that an unlawful restriction has been put on bump stocks you have turned a million+ people into felons overnight. You campaigned on being “Pro 2A”, which you aren’t otherwise this wouldn’t be law now. You know what I would say. I am off the train
2230 2018-12-22 20:04:21  You’re so lost. Trump is ruining this country. He hasn’t done anything. Hey how are your stocks lol
2231 2018-12-22 20:04:07 And last but more importantly, when a match is found make it so each player has to accept it before the match starts.

They can see the connection quality, and whay ruleset is being used. This way even if stocks, timer and stages aren't enforced you can choose not to play...
2232 2018-12-22 20:03:51 I get that you’re trying to be counter conventional thinking but you just sound ridiculous: a TV is a depreciating asset.  Stocks at least have the possibility of appreciating.
2233 2018-12-22 20:03:29 Spending is because Trump was under an Obama signed budget for his first year in office. Then he has to fight the Dems so what's your point here? We are not retreating in Syria - we are leaving them to fight their own battles. When did Trump use EA - Bump stocks?
2234 2018-12-22 20:03:28 Stocks are down, the Government is shut down, and Trump is still trying to build a wall...
2235 2018-12-22 20:03:13 I dunno. George W was able to tank the stock market faster. My Stocks are down 9% for the year.  And he drummed up a fake and illegal war in Iraq, but I guess 45 still could create illegal war in Iran. You reality TV guy is treasonous and Unintelligent. Possibly senile.
2236 2018-12-22 20:03:05 To be clear.  The Dow Jones reflects the combined share prices of 30 stocks not the entire market.  And driven up or down by just a few stocks.  Don’t panic.  Normal for the market to go up and down.  Market artificially high because of low interest rates.  MJ
2237 2018-12-22 20:02:36 I think setting it so people only get the game mode they're looking for would be better and leave the items/FS meter next on the list.

Once those are checked out, then making it so it checks stages, timer and stocks and match those as best as possible but not enforce them.
2238 2018-12-22 20:01:25 Sorry. I can’t get excited about bump stocks. Never could. They add nothing to hunting or sport shooting IMO.
2239 2018-12-22 20:01:18 I’m sick of seeing kids killed and doing drills and lockouts.   It’s sad.  There are a million opinions ... video games, missing fathers, psych care, access to guns, proliferation of guns, good guys, bad guys, bump stocks and a partidge in a pear tree.   But no one is listening
2240 2018-12-22 19:59:35 When you realize your stocks are still plummeting
2241 2018-12-22 19:59:34 In the midst of the government shutdown, I’ve invested in some stock index funds. My thinking is two fold: it satisfies my stress shopping, and the stocks are tanking so I might as well buy low  #adulting #buybuybuy
2242 2018-12-22 19:59:17 Activision can't get "enough" money, it is a company with stocks and obviously want the price to rise so they make as much money as possible. We don't know exactly how much sony pays Activision therefore we don't know if they would make the same amount of money if exclusives are0
2243 2018-12-22 19:59:04 That's bc something went wrong with loading and refreshing in stocks it so it would never have loaded anyway
2244 2018-12-22 19:57:55 They can be converted into bump stocks. We must redesign them immediately or confiscate them. I will help destroy all existing candy canes. It's the least I can do.
2245 2018-12-22 19:56:37 Mike, the only thing I wish I SHORTED  was alllllll 500 stocks in the S and P the day you went on CNBC in January
2246 2018-12-22 19:55:45 Correct.
All this horribleness & my portfolio looks just fine.
Picking stocks is like good gas mileage:
It's not about what you drive... It's HOW you drive. 

2247 2018-12-22 19:55:38 So what your saying is....the tax cuts were a big give away to the uber wealthy and corporations just used the money to buy back stocks? At least it didn't add a trillion to our deficit. Oh wait!
2248 2018-12-22 19:55:02 I've repurposed all my bump stocks. They are no longer bump stocks, so not illegal! I encourage all others to do the same.

2250 2018-12-22 19:54:23 I realised this thinking about no fish/hunt zones.
That reef over there? Locals say it is taboo, don't go there. White colonials fish there, fish stocks collapse, because it was a fish nursery. Doh!

2253 2018-12-22 19:50:17 Molan is alleged to have been involved in firing phosphorus ammo in one of the conflicts he presided over. Thought he may have sold any excess stocks before the use by date.
2254 2018-12-22 19:50:15 The Federal Reserve raises its rate again & announces that it will raise rates at least 3 times next year. Voters give Democrats a majority in the House of Representatives, starting in Jan, 2019. It's no mystery why investors are selling off their stocks to collect profits now.
2255 2018-12-22 19:49:55 If you are a young investor in particular, thinking about the long term, then you should move money into stocks over the next few days. You will see solid returns at such a low price for many of these stocks. #StockMarket

2265 2018-12-22 19:45:39 Be careful, last 4 days btc was pumping when stocks was crashing...
2266 2018-12-22 19:45:30 It’s a fed bubble, QE 3 blew the NASDAQ up to twice the size as it was before the dot com crash. FANG stocks with triple digit P/E’s.
2267 2018-12-22 19:45:29 I didn't think I still had to do a #Christmas shop -til my Tesco delivery, booked 3 weeks ago, just arrived. Turns out the meat joint is eat by tomorrow. In a Christmas delivery! Shouldn't someone have planned stocks better? NOW I have to go into a store. But it won't be Tesco.
2268 2018-12-22 19:45:29 Not all stocks are to be judged using the same parameters

2270 2018-12-22 19:43:27 You’re letting emotion cloud reason.  You’d probably sleep better with cash buried in coffee cans.  Dollar cost averaging is more fun in a down market.  More stocks for same $. Buy quality stocks that pay dividends.  Reinvest dividends.  Bear markets never last.

2276 2018-12-22 19:41:18 @realDonaldTrump The Trump BEAR MARKET has just begun. Sell all stocks, sell short and buy puts. The Adderall addict is coming in for a hard landing.

2282 2018-12-22 19:37:05 Let’s be clear... when the Stock Market tanks it is a gift to wealthy people that have the resources to buy these cheap stocks... and it is yet another way for the super wealthy to get wealthier at the expense of the working class.

2287 2018-12-22 19:35:09 I think so too; stocks do not move in a straightline; my guess is Market Makers will drive it down on Monday, similar to #PreThanksgiving, maximize negative narrative by #retailtraders, then #Ripfacesoff Wed-Thur.  Just a theory on how they make their billions quarterly :).
2288 2018-12-22 19:34:02 On the point about Republicans and the stock market, is true! Republicans are bad for business and stocks!

2290 2018-12-22 19:32:11 Agree, especially with him saying only 2 more hikes. .5 won't make much difference, makes me wonder if interest rate sensitive stocks are too oversold also.
2291 2018-12-22 19:32:10 Are there any legitimate stocks that have popped at that rate? It seems such rapid growth ought to be a pretty strong signal...
2292 2018-12-22 19:31:41 The walking in on young teens was his bragging.

First step on Gun control Bump stocks... if you tweet 
Obama and ban on Bump stocks.. I bet 1,000 of angry tweets
2293 2018-12-22 19:31:33 Hard Republicans- Trump won't take our guns! Mexico will pay for the wall! 

Also hard Republicans- here take our bump stocks. We dont care about repercussions. Oh we'll pay for the wall. 

Me- holy shit yall have lost your minds.
2294 2018-12-22 19:30:31 Awesome. Now sell it, buy gold, gold stocks and Bitcoin and you will become one of the wealthiest guys in Finland. Stay 100% long equities and you will lose 70%. Just my opinion but I have been doing this successfully for 40 years.
2295 2018-12-22 19:30:14 It's being publicly traded. Like three big companies. Investing into it is on you. I am no investment specialist. I'm on the ground floor of a company that grows it so I'm not much interested in cannabis stocks. I'm investing into mining companies and making bank. Thanks Trump.

If you had voted the right candidate, you wouldn't have a trade war, your stock wouldn't tank, even if you lost your job, your healthcare premiums wouldn't explode. Choices matter!

2311 2018-12-22 19:24:38 The stock is having a sudden crash at the moment meaning it’ll be a great time to stock up on low prices which while boost the stocks because of the high demand we need to act fast y’all
2312 2018-12-22 19:24:33 Speaking of security, quick question: what is the motive behind making bump stocks illegal?  Is it about protecting citizens or about keeping them from protecting themselves? I'm just a little curious about this move. I'm not sure we got a good explanation of this.

2321 2018-12-22 19:19:20 If needing the cash now, you should not invest in the market. If you’re long term investor, you should hold what you have- too late to sell after 15% down. Perhaps you will be regret in a few years that you did not buy the stocks at this year’s liquidation sell. Dollar averaging!
2322 2018-12-22 19:18:52 Where is the outrage over the 6 trillion dollars that was just drained off by a democratic fed chief out of our stocks iras and 401 k s and sending our economy to almost a recession and their bitchin over 5 billion wtf
2323 2018-12-22 19:18:49 Interesting. Trump thinks firing Powell, head of the Fed, would solve a problem. That bear market sending stocks into free fall is directly tied to the poor leadership of Trump, not the Fed. Every time the guy tweets a new harebrained idea, the markets react.

2327 2018-12-22 19:14:47 "According to Roll Call, Pelosi &her husband hold properties "worth at least $14.65 million, Roll Call said Pelosi's earnings are connected to her husband's heavy investments in stocks,the Pelosis have $13.46 million in liabilities including mortgages on seven properties."
2328 2018-12-22 19:14:17 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses
2329 2018-12-22 19:13:41 I’m almost shifting back to the trump is a shitty president kind of thing. banning bump stocks and 30 round mags, while threatening a government shutdown if the wall isn’t funded. that’s not compromise that ransom. idk tho, guess we’ll see what happens.
2330 2018-12-22 19:13:38 Bring it on.  What you’ve seen in these previous months in stocks is going to reflect nothing.  It will be worst at an instant!
2331 2018-12-22 19:13:29 I’m glad I’m not alone in this   Chipotle Tabasco is the best and no restaurant stocks it
2332 2018-12-22 19:13:17 I don’t trade subpenny stocks but perhaps I’ll give it a look
2333 2018-12-22 19:13:01 No she’s right.  Stocks crashing effects the ability of companies to raise capital.  So smaller younger companies can’t get funding.  But it also effects people’s financials which means less consumer spending. Which means Apple gets less revenue which means lower earnings
2334 2018-12-22 19:12:57 It's more about how long it took you to make the 18% that you just lost in last 3 months. Most folks in crypto believe that once bulls are back, the 85% loss will disappear in a year or 2. Not the case in stocks
2335 2018-12-22 19:12:28 Yeah, that’ll help the stocks bounce back. Keep it up, Trump 
2336 2018-12-22 19:12:16 The loss of bump stocks has them lashing out like beached piranhas. Sad, wrong, unfair.
2337 2018-12-22 19:12:04 The changes to sheik’s nair and bouncing fish just ruin the character for me. Taking stocks feels even more impossible now
2338 2018-12-22 19:11:21 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2339 2018-12-22 19:09:26 Those cryptonerds who hate the stock market and think that a crash in the stocks would be bullish for crypto are just hilarious 
2340 2018-12-22 19:09:01 WE were forced to buy a pipeline. 6 times over priced. And his stocks went up substantially. #TrudeauMustGo is a crook.
2341 2018-12-22 19:08:35 Their stock price has been following the trend of the overall market. I have stocks that got pummeled this week because the overall market was down 6% this week and is down 10% YTD.
2342 2018-12-22 19:08:31 @kyliecosmetics  is there anyone in the uk that stocks ur makeup or have we gotta order online from the usa ? If not have u got any plans on having ur makeup sold in the UK please ? Thanks xx
2343 2018-12-22 19:08:13 Bubble mate.

Most people don't own stocks, don't understand the market and frankly are fed up with what they perceive as a fetishism over something that's disconnected from their life.

It's a good example of the break in our system.
2344 2018-12-22 19:08:02 Not for some people.  Stocks can always go to zero!
2345 2018-12-22 19:07:56 Sister restaurant Stocks, in Poulton, was as good, if not better.
2346 2018-12-22 19:07:18 Let's say your crypto portfolio is down 50% and stocks 25%. The way crypto can move if it turns, you might not be worse off.
2347 2018-12-22 19:05:56 Mormon Church priority: posthumously baptizing Hitler.

Not: Helping the homeless.


2348 2018-12-22 19:04:10 vice versa, we r on the top of newly opened downslope trend channel and yet there isnt any signal for bullish reversal. now stocks are expensive and if there s a rise this will be opportunity to sell
2349 2018-12-22 19:04:06 And the only way that can happen is by actually trading with those scripts. Once you are financially involved with any stocks, all your senses will work towards chart, price action,etc..
2350 2018-12-22 19:03:13 McConnell is against Trump and has his retirement set, his way out; his investments in hemp stocks and other investments (of dubious legal standing). On January 3 and with Mueller's report, Trump is flattened and removed. Hamstring him now, you have GOP alliance on that issue.
2351 2018-12-22 19:03:11 There is always a buyer and a seller on a trade, and both think they are right. 

Fyi, i bought stocks and sold puts as well. This winter feels warm.
2352 2018-12-22 19:03:05 Is that after I lose 2 stocks
2353 2018-12-22 19:02:26 I don’t use bump stocks those are for people that can’t hit their target, I have no issues hitting my targets.
2354 2018-12-22 19:01:54 Dear @POTUS,

The people want to know: why are you willing to trample the 2nd amendment by banning bump stocks (might as well ban rubber bands), and yet, we STILL do not know what really happened at the Las Vegas massacre??
~Everyone
2355 2018-12-22 19:01:33 We believe this "spiral of death" echoes the sell off on February the difference, it has the added punch of being at year end. 

We do not believe the profitability potential of various FAANG stocks has decreased 30-40%, as reflected in their share price.

You know who wants our Tax Money wasted on a POS wall? Republicans who have stocks or received $$$ from contractors wanting to build the wall.
2357 2018-12-22 18:59:22 I have more than1 million brothers and sisters that got killed by this industry of manufacturing weapons . Some lost their babies , some died inside their moms womb . Parents witness their kids killed . And some people are buying their stocks and make money out of it .

Parents witness their kids killed . And some people are buying their stocks and make money out of it . How fair ?
2359 2018-12-22 18:57:54 It's not necessarily market timing, IMO. You can now find more stocks satisfying your valuation criteria than a few months ago. If you didn't change your criteria and are just catching more fish because the pond is larger, then it's just application of a disciplined strategy.
2360 2018-12-22 18:57:54 You mean companies pay @mschlapp despite message development like this?  Excuse me while I call my broker; there are a few stocks I need to short.
2361 2018-12-22 18:57:34 Someone buy me stocks of apple for Christmas. They’re going for the low rn 
2362 2018-12-22 18:57:31 My state passed the red flag law and banned bump stocks in May.
2363 2018-12-22 18:56:54 And they take 2 stocks  yea that's better. Thanks.
2364 2018-12-22 18:55:53 I know but what does he do besides hang out on twitter and claim to trade stocks?
2365 2018-12-22 18:55:21 I’ll choose 5 random stocks by throwing darts and guarantee a return higher than 2018 crypto
2366 2018-12-22 18:54:34 Why all the caps? Anyway not sure how abolishing nafta helps as it will also have a detrimental affect american trade as trades will be placed on american goods as well. 

Given that the stocks gave taken a hit recently argueably abolishing nafta has had negative effect maybe?
2367 2018-12-22 18:54:03 Stocks always go down when federal reserve raises interest rates. It has nothing to do with Trump.
2368 2018-12-22 18:54:02 Thanks, Meegan! I still enjoy your early morning business reports on @LondonMorning! Btw, I couldn't make it through "Stocks for Fun and Profit." Thanks anyway. It was fun to win! Now that I think of it, it might make an acceptable last minute Christmas gift for somebody. 
2369 2018-12-22 18:53:57 Stocks are down as people take advantage of the milder winter to diversify into more liquid assets. Econ 101
2370 2018-12-22 18:53:53 I watch a news feed all day long while trading stocks and saw Obama get in office and offer GOPer Gregg
a cabinet position. Gregg turned around and gutted Obama on the budget. Did you read the Atlantic article. Get a clue
2371 2018-12-22 18:53:48 Well what they go off of is EA, activision, Ubisoft, and Bethesda how their stocks are falling more and more and are not recovering
2372 2018-12-22 18:53:31 Thanks - I honestly suck with Penny/ micro caps/ illiquid stocks. Most of my work is $1bn+

2377 2018-12-22 18:51:34 While we take in the cluster fuck that is the wall funding please remember Trump did two things he told his voters he wouldn't. He banned bump stocks and is about to pass a bipartisan prison reform bill. So now he's just pissing off both sides.
2378 2018-12-22 18:49:52 Banned bump-fire stocks and withdraw troops from Syria, I thought we had a Dem in the oval office already?
2379 2018-12-22 18:47:30 I asked  what's ur success in stocks? try to avoid?
2380 2018-12-22 18:47:24 Thoughts on BA and UNH? They hold the key in my opinion. Parabolic Dow stocks that still look way overpriced
2381 2018-12-22 18:46:36 Don't lose all hopes folks - here are the 13 best large-cap stocks to own for January.  ABC, AWK, CAH, CBOE, HSIC, ILMN, LNG, MXIM, NFLX, NVO, SHY, SIRI, and SYK.  Historically, these are the best stocks to own in January where the returns were positive at least 8 out of 10 times
2382 2018-12-22 18:46:11 It sounds good but I don't like it. It re-opens the door to Obama's war on talk radio like Rush Limbaugh. I don't like anything that can give dems a reason to interpret it another way. That's why I hate this bump stocks ban
2383 2018-12-22 18:45:29 Tanked relative to other shoe stocks. I thought that was assumed.
2384 2018-12-22 18:45:10 Investing my $ into stocks and bonds prolly the best thing I ever did
2385 2018-12-22 18:44:28 stacking my$$ investing in the stocks
2386 2018-12-22 18:43:58 there are legal marijuana stocks on the market
2387 2018-12-22 18:43:53 The Fed Reserve is throwing a MONKEY WRENCH into STOCK MARKET highs! Raising interest rates causes stocks to plummet bc it takes $ from big corps to use to invest in them! I'm wondering if it's not intentional on Fed Reserve part to make Trump look bad? I wouldn't put itpast them
2388 2018-12-22 18:43:20 I have not taken a look at stocks but hoollly shit I just glanced at the Dow Jones and... <.<...It just keeps going down huh
2389 2018-12-22 18:42:42 That's actually not why the stocks are falling lol. Another good try. I did hear that though on cnn lol
2390 2018-12-22 18:41:05 Het zou me idd verwonderen dat er nog bivakmutsen van in de jaren 50 en 60 in omloop zouden zijn. Stocks en overstocks werden een tijdlang geleden al opgekuist. Al is het Eqt beheer nooit echt top geweest.
2391 2018-12-22 18:41:00 There are dividend paying stocks, you know?
2392 2018-12-22 18:40:19 same ones that sell stocks when they are going down in price.
2393 2018-12-22 18:39:01 and what happen if we gave him the wall money  and stocks fall really bad,   what  money are we going to use   to help bell out Trump Towers?
2394 2018-12-22 18:38:50 /2 At big banks the sell side and the buy side are fully separated. Sell side sees his own buy side division as a client. Treated like any other client. Has no idea what the buy side is doing with respect to buying or selling stocks. No conflict.
2395 2018-12-22 18:38:37 A majority of stocks in their category have been dropping for months. Take a look at Hasbro and Mattel. Mattel has been dropping ever since Hasbro took Disney. This is normal this time of year. They will recover, good time to buy will probably be Jan/Feb. I bought only 2 shares.
2396 2018-12-22 18:35:39 If stocks crash and home values plummet @realDonaldTrump will be a one term president and we'll end up with someone like @Ocasio2018   God help us!
2397 2018-12-22 18:35:32 You’re a clown. Stocks are absolutely not at an all time low. Quit watching CNN, BBC, and MSNBC  
People in Paris even chanting for Trump. 
2398 2018-12-22 18:34:41 W-why? C-come on... I'm thirsty... *Opens his mouth and stocks his tongue out*
2399 2018-12-22 18:34:39 Agree. Some people sell #NATO short. #Russia vs. Euro NATO might be a wash, but NATO will still make them pay. A big issue for Europeans is munition stocks. IIRC France ran short after a few days in Libya? 

Who will not allow?
2400 2018-12-22 18:34:13 Yeah my pocket said otherwise under Obama.  Now I had to move my stocks to bonds to not get killed.  Luckily I had some good intuition to move my money weeks ago!
2401 2018-12-22 18:34:06 I have been talking about times we have not seen (bad times). Still sitting with my favourite stocks. 
2402 2018-12-22 18:34:01 Oh hell no! If Trump wanted the wall so bad, he should have gotten it instead of giving a giant tax cut to the wealthy & corps that they used to buy back stocks instead of raising wages. The damn wall won't even help. Better spend it on electronic and drone protection of border.
2403 2018-12-22 18:33:38 Aren’t US stocks at an all time low? Employment is a knock on from Obama’s work. Yeah you deep into the tango rabbit hole dude. Hope you find your way out
2404 2018-12-22 18:33:28 Let’s hope that mom and pop wanted to dump their stocks before the holiday season so they can enjoy the coming week with their “to do” list accomplished
2405 2018-12-22 18:33:13 Smallest number of weekly NYSE unchanged stocks since early 2016.  Sign of a washout?
2406 2018-12-22 18:31:40 So, how will they collect all those "evil" bump stocks?
2407 2018-12-22 18:31:38 Banning bump stocks would be big news in a normal presidency; however, a president bogged down with 17 investigations where Trump Tower Moscow papers were leaked, and judges asking Flynn about Treason, and more..... the big news is Trump trying to sow chaos to distract.
2408 2018-12-22 18:31:32 Yes. I'll go back to trading individual stocks in play (gappers +/-3%+ on high RVOL and news catalyst) when the ATR on the indices comes back down. Until then, stick to what's working.
2409 2018-12-22 18:31:06 @LelandVittert the drop in the market reflects the direct transfer from stocks to bonds and treasuries after 8 raises in the interest rate in two years by the Fed; an unheard of series of raises.
2410 2018-12-22 18:30:12 Every time the stock market has declined, it eventually has more than fully recovered. Hedging the stock market by shorting stocks, or by buying puts on the S&P 500 Index, or any other method usually is expensive, and, in the long run, is a waste of money. -- Ed Wachenheim

2423 2018-12-22 18:27:28 People don't seem to understand yet. We haven't seen a downturn like this, it might worsen, which means this is a very rare event that needs some respect. Don't panic, this is what bulls pray for and never get, a chance to get into great stocks on the cheap. Pick away slowly. .
2424 2018-12-22 18:27:28 Agree , stay away from individual stocks in a choppy volatile tape. Index etfs, small positions, low risk, high quality setups.

2444 2018-12-22 18:14:15 Yes, but as the article clearly states the uk govt sells these quotas on, 29% to just 5 families, this obviously puts smaller vessels at a disadvantage. Before the CFP, we collapsed fish stocks, hence we illeagally raided Icelandic waters. Since the CFP fish stocks are recovering
2445 2018-12-22 18:14:09 I also had some MJ stocks that date when report came out and entire sector went south, but I don’t blame those who made the report.

2452 2018-12-22 18:10:16 Nasdaq is growing through the most, and technology stocks it's rough shem

2455 2018-12-22 18:08:11 A whopping 2027 stocks made 52-week lows yesterday, and 23 stocks made 52-week highs.  Any guess on which of the stocks made 52-week highs? 
2456 2018-12-22 18:07:50 Lets not and say we did hey. Some of us poor buggers use that already overpriced fuel to maintain and plant our existing tree stocks. How’s about a few councillors a politicians take a paycut to help pay for it
2457 2018-12-22 18:07:35 @AmazonHelp what’s happening to your stocks @amazonIN @JeffBezos  this is ridiculous!! Lost 40k and counting thanks to you
2458 2018-12-22 18:06:48 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @SenateDems @SenateGOP @senatemajldr Trump is a fucking LIAR. Trump said Mexico would PAY FOR IT! Dems we’re willing to give BILLIONS early on! This shutdown is a damn joke! Stocks crashing? Syria? Afghan? LIES? Investigations? #ResignTrump #TrumpLies
2459 2018-12-22 18:05:50 Trump cant’t fire Powell unilaterally, congress would need to act based on legal grounds (wrongdoing). However, if that could ever happen, not sure stocks would go up due to the severe insituational damage.
2460 2018-12-22 18:04:45 @elerianm Hi Mohamed when do you think is a time to buy stocks specifically energy--fan of your tv segments.
2461 2018-12-22 18:03:58 Hey Caroline I just thought I’d remind you that you have promised to provide that video.  Also, just wondering, with another resignation, government shut down and stocks crashing you are still thinking Dumpy is maga?

2465 2018-12-22 18:03:12 Long term trend on the Dow shows we are still in an uptrend. #stocks
2466 2018-12-22 18:02:08 if I didn't fool with stocks I might agree, the market is a tool for the wealthy to use and steal our 401k money, there is more money to be made shorting than going long, those guys make money both ways so they do not care nothing to do with Trump for the downside

2470 2018-12-22 18:00:05 TD, please bring back FRIP taken from Scottrade clients. FYI, FRIP allowed investors to pool dividends and then allocate them to any 5 stocks/funds at any percentage, monthly at no cost. Balance holdings, built new positions. Awesome tool lost! Let TD know if you want it.
2471 2018-12-22 18:00:05 Absolutely. Stocks just went on sale (including AAPL)!
2472 2018-12-22 18:00:03 Quality value #stocks must have significantly higher upside than downside, or a large #marginofsafety.
2473 2018-12-22 17:59:58 Lol, turn off your notifications and don’t look at your stocks again for 20 years, that’s the only sane way to do this
2474 2018-12-22 17:59:36 Be sure to surrender any bump stocks you have.
2475 2018-12-22 17:58:57 My market thesis has been the same since 2016. Stocks and bonds will continue to take turns falling until they both are in deep bear markets. The Fed needs to understand that QE wasn’t an action they can undue at a later date. It has to be printed away.
2476 2018-12-22 17:58:56 That rule flew out the window when they bought stocks in Coca Cola  they can have caffeinated soda

2478 2018-12-22 17:57:40 @realDonaldTrump RS: “Here comes the Trump Slump:
+ Worst week in stocks since financial crisis of 2008
+ Worst December since the Great Depression
+ Tariff Man’s policies hurting industry and global trade
+ Government shutdown”
Ha ha ha ha ha...all true!!!!!!!
2479 2018-12-22 17:57:32 “Stocks” = the S&P 500 index. This is pretty common industry shorthand. If I ask a colleague “what are stocks doing?”, he/she doesn’t start listing off each equity in alphabetical order (unless they’re trolling).
2480 2018-12-22 17:56:48 Dear @POTUS,

Why are you signing a new NAFTA that gives power to Big Tech over our online speech and data, banning bump stocks, allowing anchor babies, failing to build a wall (use the military), and letting Mueller run wild and destroy innocent lives? Why?  You have the power.
2481 2018-12-22 17:55:51 Also yes you're welcome to discuss bout stocks or investments since expenditure is my depart
2482 2018-12-22 17:55:12 Deep in your gut you must realize that the climate has changed since the beginning of the earth and that fisherman would love to have someone else to blame for a declining fish stocks when it is more likely due to overfishing or natural variation.
2483 2018-12-22 17:55:12 Hey @realDonaldTrump Stocks had worst week in a decade. This is on you! You own this. Why aren't you out there claiming responsibility? Ego can't handle it? You are a sorry excuse.
2484 2018-12-22 17:53:02 He’s less likely now to have to steam off 6miles than he was before... he won’t have to compete with over 18s inside the 6nm... that is what was happening all along.. Inshore stocks we depleted and small boat were forced to fish offshore
2485 2018-12-22 17:52:54 Love how all of a sudden we are seeing "recession fears" headlines all over the place, but a few months ago when stocks were at records you never heard the "r" word. Yet they love to say the stock market is not the economy.
2486 2018-12-22 17:52:50 Under Obama, U.S. stocks more than tripled investors' money, generating total returns (which include the value of reinvested dividends) of 235%.
2487 2018-12-22 17:52:46 Open Sunday 10-5pm and Christmas Eve 10-4pm still got good stocks of most things ! Traffic has been pretty good too (so far) do do come and see us and let us help make Christmas even more special !!! 
2488 2018-12-22 17:52:42 Ignore 1-5

Buy up all stocks of a yard of CHORIZO
2489 2018-12-22 17:52:20 It’s my mission to understand what “the Fed” is, and how we could return to the Gold Standard and what effect that would have on the economy/stocks.  I read most of your links until I got totally lost. I get the gist but is there a layman’s reliable resource available? TYIA
2490 2018-12-22 17:52:19 Yes. I looked at a number of stocks this morning that are very good values this morning. So are you a value investor who buys stocks if they are a good value? Or are you a market timer, unwilling to buy stocks if you believe market will be dropping more?
2491 2018-12-22 17:51:59 why do republicans even want a wall like your stocks are crashing like the dirty thirties again and y'all are looking at a 5 million dollar fence that won't even span half of the territory
2492 2018-12-22 17:51:26 So true! Investments in stocks & buying crypto should come after bills are payed & some savings has been established. If you want to buy into either stocks or crypto’s then small purchases could be possible if you choose to cook at home and avoid eating out. Pay yourself first!
2493 2018-12-22 17:51:13 I woke up middle of October and said November and december is going to be crazy logged on and moved all 401k $$ to a 1% fund no stocks. At today’s market I have save over $60k from loss and with this crazy I expect it to be a lot more #bailoutofstocks

2495 2018-12-22 17:50:31 These patterns don't exist in a vacuum. It seems an extreme stretch to imagine that the current global slowdown & correction of somewhat overvalued stocks is anywhere near as potentially lethal as the global financial crisis or the insane PE valuations of 2000. Dangers were known
2496 2018-12-22 17:50:17 If these stocks don’t go back up, I’m going to start drinking again. I’m so afraid right now holy shit  bro
2497 2018-12-22 17:50:17 Stick them in stocks in the departure lounge of Gatwick Airport and see what reception they get #peoplesretribution
2498 2018-12-22 17:50:12 Whatever happened to "Mexico will fund the wall" - by spending your own money to fund the wall, you are accepting being a martyr for your country.  Guess you do not need a job and you do not care about you stocks.
2499 2018-12-22 17:49:35 #TrumpResign 

Our fake ass leader has managed to get the government shut down halfway.   Selfish all because of a wall we don’t need. Be ready for the stocks to drop.
2500 2018-12-22 17:49:18 For those who can't track tick by tick stock moves always trade in Index only..as Index trading is far safe compare to stocks,bcoz index always recover sooner or later n give enough opportunity to exit,further if 100 point fall your max loss 7500 only while in stocks it be high.
2501 2018-12-22 17:49:15 You gotta be a stupid mf to be the reason that stocks are down during Christmas time. #TrumpResign

2504 2018-12-22 17:48:15 Definitely watching all stocks right now
2505 2018-12-22 17:47:48 Think I’m about to start using Robin Hood and buy some penny stocks
2506 2018-12-22 17:45:47 1/2 I certainly understand the concept of a liquid security representing illiquid assets, income producing assets. Common stocks are liquid ownership in companies with plant and equipment that produce earnings.
2507 2018-12-22 17:44:53 Look into whose going to supply that steel, and how there will be kickback, in the form of stocks, contracts, and blatant $$$ laundering. This is the same Trump sleaze bag shuffle, song n dance.
2508 2018-12-22 17:43:58 That's a good thing, buy it up now while you can. It's black Friday but with stocks.
2509 2018-12-22 17:43:11 I was watching c-span earlier. Experts were telling us how computers have algorithms: that react in chunks to sell stocks after receiving information from the media. Is the picture getting clearer? 
2510 2018-12-22 17:42:37 How to know intrinsic value of cryptocurrency ? Is value investing and fundamental analisys possible for cryptos like it is in stocks ?
2511 2018-12-22 17:42:34 I don’t think McKenna truly understood the machinations of Capital. Wonder what he’d say if he saw that the majority of web traffic today is hardcore pornography and bots trading stocks with each other
2512 2018-12-22 17:42:26 @ASlavitt
WTF are "most Americans" doing gambling their savings on the stock market? Has recent history taught them nothing? Stocks are for those who can afford to lose everything.
2513 2018-12-22 17:42:01 My stocks like $EPD $MMP $NWL and $ACB are on hold. Lost too much to sell. $O $CHD $ABX and $HRL seem to handle this down market well. My penny stocks seem less volatile in this market. I added to $CELZ $TSOI $MDFZF and $INND
2514 2018-12-22 17:41:43 1) TTM GAAP PEs:
S&P 500: 19.5
Nasdaq 100: 20.2
Russell 2000: 37.8

Those numbers will come down further when "TTM" includes Q4 2018,  an additional quarter with lower corporate taxes. So stocks aren't "cheap" but also not in an "earnings-valuation bubble." The ? is 2019 earnings
2515 2018-12-22 17:41:32 Options are the way to go a few stocks under 15 I buy shares if there is not much options activity
2516 2018-12-22 17:41:08 The $615 month “donations” is interesting

He probably means YOLO calls on FANG stocks
2517 2018-12-22 17:39:34 Absolutely right! The political outlook is awful. Plus when stocks fall there is a strong positive (i.e. reinforcing) feedback loop that accentuates the fall - forced sellers, margin calls, ETFs (?), funds selling out, high levels of debt and just plain panic. Could go ..
2518 2018-12-22 17:39:10 Il est où le #gourou #castaner !?

2519 2018-12-22 17:38:45 3 stocks always get you a 1 v 1 ngl
2520 2018-12-22 17:38:16 Abt 6 months ago it occurred to me that with a clownish reality TV star running the country, the stock market would probly crash. 

I considered selling stocks in my meager 401k, but then thought only fools try to time the market. 

Now I'm kinda regretting not following my gut.
2521 2018-12-22 17:37:42 now since you're jobless you might also want to talk about my part time job. you might have an input on rearranging stocks or investments since im also licensed in US securities. 

just fall in line and keep on mentioning me so i don't forget you despite my busy schedule
2522 2018-12-22 17:37:05 Mr. Trump, two days ago you said, "Border is tight". 

So please pay attention to the economy. 

The Wall St. Journal's headline today is "Stocks Cap Worst Week Since 2008".

Your tariffs are slowing the economy.  Many think a recession is on the horizon.

This isn't MAGA, is it?
2523 2018-12-22 17:37:02 Bump stocks werent used in Vegas. Belt fed weapons wereThis whole bump stock thing is a crock
2524 2018-12-22 17:36:58 Yes, but demand is more complex that 1 guy maxing his credit card. Takes 100s millions guys w/ same behavior & lots of time plus much consumer demand for oil inelastic.

Big component of demand is movement of stocks in & out of inventories—long value chain process.
2525 2018-12-22 17:36:53 Exactly. State of the world where Trump is able to replace Fed chair because he's pissed stocks are down 10% is full EM IMO.
2526 2018-12-22 17:36:49 Absolutely. I made good money by acting contrary to Trump’s lies. Rode the sugar high of the #TaxScam and sold a big chunk before stocks headed south. Pretty soon, we’ll be using #TrumpRecession as well as #TrumpResign
2527 2018-12-22 17:36:48 #investors my fear of stocks going down in accordance with my study is taking shape now. Any bounce will be a trap for new investors.  Only a tip of iceberg, more pain in the ass is yet to come but a good time for cherry pick to have 2-3 times return with 5-10 years horizon
2528 2018-12-22 17:36:16 Not just dow stocks — Chinese and techstocks too.  

Chinese companies are massively undervalued — once trade situation sorts itself out.   Amazon is into buy territory.  

Don’t think this will be as severe as 2008, and if so, now is the time to buy.  Nasdaq down 20% in a week..
2529 2018-12-22 17:35:58 Is it time to put a mortgage on the house buy more stocks? No we are nowhere near those levels.  When you see the S&P 500 dividend yield  above the 10 year treasury yield - that's the time. That said: here's the take from my perch:
2530 2018-12-22 17:35:37 Looks like all stocks, earned from the last stint have struck the bottom.
Just another sinister ploy, sponsored by the rss to digress and divert the country's attention from the total misgovernance n failure to keep up to it's promises.
With due respects Annaji, Give us a break

2533 2018-12-22 17:33:52 The Fed kept rates close to zero for years. This was unwise. It created a bubble wherein businesses were borrowing money to buy their own stocks and bonds. A correction was inevitable. If the correction is big now imagine what it would be like if we actually were in a recession.

2535 2018-12-22 17:32:48 Dem ryzen stocks are higher than that supaman cape on his back
2536 2018-12-22 17:31:40 People mistakenly judge the decline to be a buying opportunity and find stocks cheap in relation to both past earnings and expected earnings, failing to account for the amount of decline in earnings that is likely to result from what’s to come. #wealtheffect
2537 2018-12-22 17:31:36 Gonna follow your lead here. I’ve tried before and failed. Gonna make it stick now, just stocks no politics.
2538 2018-12-22 17:31:26 Bologna we don't "have" to raise our defense spending.  Iraq war pushed by GOP was the BIGGEST waste of money that found no WMD's. With or w/o war companies buy back stocks and layoff workers EVERY tax cut. It NEVER worked and NEVER Will. & Blaming SS wont get GOP elected again
2539 2018-12-22 17:31:22 Who has had control of house, Senate and exc branch? Repbu, look at mess we're in. SofD resigns in protest first time in history, stocks falling, djt doing Putin's bidding
2540 2018-12-22 17:30:56 Jackass, most Americans have no meaningful wealth in stocks. We’re fighting to live week to week.
2541 2018-12-22 17:30:52 The financial crisis seemed like a much longer process. I'm not sure if this is just money out of stocks into bonds because of worries about debt and rates and cut in valuations due to global slowdown in 2019? Curious to see when the selling ends. Vix over 30??
2542 2018-12-22 17:30:40 Here's the thing about Jerome Powell, he's right.
If the market is plummeting this much during a healthy economy imagine what would happen if we were actually in a recession with inflation "stagflation" & the Fed had to hike rates
Whoa Nellie, stocks would drop by 50% or more
2543 2018-12-22 17:29:57 our stocks are down. pulling US troops from syria not really a good idea rn. everyone around is turning or stepping down. our government is in shutdown over a stupid wall. please step down #TrumpShutdown #TrumpResgn
2544 2018-12-22 17:29:22 Or stocks down - " institutions risk" uncertainty?

+ Government shutdown
2548 2018-12-22 17:29:01 Bought my first stocks last night
2549 2018-12-22 17:28:52 Option Trading finally became a thing. Like the beginning days of penny stocks. Options use to be a very scary word for me anyway. How time progresses
2550 2018-12-22 17:28:51 @realDonaldTrump doesn't know shit about how the economy works!
The artificially high Dow is a sign that rates rising will result in upticks in the Bond market and a realistic correction in stocks.

2551 2018-12-22 17:28:45 You can literally taste the bearishness here. The trend is down, big time, but trends reverse at some point. Otherwise all stocks would either head to zero or infinity...
2552 2018-12-22 17:28:28 It's sad to watch our leadership at the highest level go home to their families (or golf clubs), leaving Americans furloughed, because it doesn't affect them

It's even more sad (& scary) that our president doesn't care about public opinion, polls, stocks or his federal employees
2553 2018-12-22 17:28:00 You’ve not even been bothered. You said you loved driving long way round
2554 2018-12-22 17:27:45 The last time the Republicans had a one party rule for over a decade they drove us into the Great Depression by tax cuts for the wealthy and deregulating the markets. I guess we are getting off easy this time. Of course- not out of the woods yet with the Stocks tanking.
2555 2018-12-22 17:27:23 He doesnt control the stocks
2556 2018-12-22 17:26:33 Hi.   I am personally tired of all the winning.   My 401k is tanking.   Stocks are tanking.  The government is shut down.  The adult care keepers are quitting.  And our president is allowing ISIS to reform.
2557 2018-12-22 17:25:57 Gucci flip flops, Isabelle fucked up my stocks. Bitch my Stock gone she be fucking eating my socks
2558 2018-12-22 17:25:53 Dimm's Are All Still Hating On Trump Big Time.

He's Passed Criminal Justice Reform, Banning Of Bump Stocks, And Getting Out Of Syria.

Why Are They Mad???

Only A Very Small Segment Of Them Are Radical & Stupid Enough To Really Want Open Borders.

Which Means They Love To Hate…
2559 2018-12-22 17:25:52 Do they have a Twitter or lol?
2560 2018-12-22 17:25:36 I know of people who invested in those same stocks and got nothing. In a country with no economic growth it is not worth it. Next thing you know the company you invested in doesn't exist with the current economic climate.
2561 2018-12-22 17:25:06 The Common Agricultural Policy: ensuring food security & environmental standards. The Common Fisheries Policy: ensuring sustainable fish stocks; EU ‘passporting’ system enabling cross border financial services. Protection  of water quality, giving clean rivers and beaches.
2562 2018-12-22 17:24:32 but really what do you actually ~need~ bump stocks for?? If you have the license to carry, fine, but what are bump stocks necessary for?
2563 2018-12-22 17:23:28 XLU they’re a group of stocks also. REIT VNQ not any better.
2564 2018-12-22 17:22:40 You should Martin we put nats in the stocks here
2565 2018-12-22 17:22:06 FAANG stocks are Friendster, AOL, AskJeeves, Netscape, and GeoCities.
2566 2018-12-22 17:21:46 He promised to not attack the 2A, wants to, or recently has banned bump stocks. He promised to help defend the border, loads of migrants are still coming in. Just to name a couple.
2567 2018-12-22 17:21:36 @Vzwsupprt I'm thinking about switching to prepaid since I don't have a job and the stocks are going the wrong way. People in Hondas are having to get free gas from the company to survive.
2568 2018-12-22 17:21:34 Nasdaq in bear market, first of the three major U.S. indexes: The Nasdaq Composite Index confirmed on Friday it is in a bear market for the first time since 2008, underscoring fears that the longest bull run in history for U.S. stocks could soon be over.
2569 2018-12-22 17:20:57 @marksandspencer could you tell me which stores, in Nottingham, stock gluten free pork pies and scotch eggs please? Having a nightmare trying to find somewhere that stocks them
2570 2018-12-22 17:20:29 Was happy after winning a bottle last year to see that my local garden centre stocks it
2571 2018-12-22 17:19:50 Not that I’m aware of but they also don’t allow you to pick individual stocks afaik so they’re exposing user to less risk
2572 2018-12-22 17:19:50 Any parent will tell you: Forget investing in Apple stocks. The real money is in paper towel manufacturer stock.

2576 2018-12-22 17:19:22 Also keep an eye on Chinese stocks $BABA $JD $WUBA $CTRP tax cuts and more stimulus is some thing to take note.
2577 2018-12-22 17:18:47 Jay Bhavani is not the front runner any more, it is facing some tough competition from the HL Vadapav these days. 
HL Vadapav is delicious, stocks out by 6PM. 
Highly recommended...

2579 2018-12-22 17:18:22 Embracing my emotion thru the whole bear market of crypto has helped me to be mentally well-prepared for what might happen in almost any field. Stocks, Bonds, Life, Relationship ... Man, that exp is priceless
2580 2018-12-22 17:17:10 I thought I was a genius (a word I need spellcheck to spell correctly) by picking stocks to short. I then realized I could have pinned the tail on any ass on that wall and been correct.
2581 2018-12-22 17:17:09 IMHO the Canadian stocks dropped as they got caught up with sell if in US. The drop is nothing to do with Canada's economy.
2582 2018-12-22 17:17:07 smart money was pumped into these stocks? This means they are bullish in near term on these?
2583 2018-12-22 17:16:38 Can’t buy stocks w a Sephora gift card 
2584 2018-12-22 17:16:21 Rip stocks LOL
2585 2018-12-22 17:16:07 I think it’ll go back up maybe SuperValue can be a discount health food store maybe change thier direction it’ll be like should have got my stocks then type o thang
2586 2018-12-22 17:15:40 Leading stocks work in both direction.  Now an anchor on the market.  What has to happen is Institutional money completed distribution and then is ready to pick new leaders.. that won't happen quickly.  of course panic selling would help hasten the distribution process
2587 2018-12-22 17:15:18 A COMO grocery store only stocks sage as a "seasonal item." What am I expected to do with poultry for the rest of the year?
2588 2018-12-22 17:15:01 If everything is bound for a 20% haircut, gold stocks and gold should too. It's the everything bubble.
That would put us closer to $1000
2589 2018-12-22 17:14:56 What a liar! He caused ALL of these problems because of his incompetence! 
+ Worst week in stocks since financial crisis of 2008
+ Worst December since the Great Depression
+ Tariff Man’s policies hurting industry and global trade
+ Government shutdown
2590 2018-12-22 17:14:50 So, then the next line of questioning one needs to ask ones self are the FAANG stocks at these levels representative of a broken company - big concern -  or, a broken stock - a valuation point that could recover?
2591 2018-12-22 17:14:39 I rather look at stocks that don't have that kind of risk or exposure.  I try to keep it simple.  That's why I have a high win ratio.
2592 2018-12-22 17:14:38 Soros probably owns the FT thru stocks and numbered bank accounts
2593 2018-12-22 17:14:24 Taking stocks with Toon Link’s forward smash is my favorite. Buddy puts his all into that ugly ass swing. 
2594 2018-12-22 17:14:16 Off the top of your head,  any idea what stocks do over the next 6 months following a reading like this?  Thanks.
2595 2018-12-22 17:13:54 Stocks not falling fast enough for him.
2596 2018-12-22 17:13:38 so this means that sir, these stocks has more to do with international crude prices rather than how our market NIFTY is doing???
2597 2018-12-22 17:12:09 David Brooks FAANG stocks falter, fund managers make bets on survivors
2598 2018-12-22 17:10:38 whats funny is its a lie to get people to buy more stocks lol
2599 2018-12-22 17:10:16 Compared to the rest of the market it is doing well. Microsoft and Tesla are some of the best stocks to own rn
2600 2018-12-22 17:09:55 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
2601 2018-12-22 17:09:04 So Trump banned bump stocks, is threatening to confiscate guns if people don't comply, let the Fed boss everyone around and screw with financial details that I can't even grasp, pulled the troops out of Syria and declared victory in a war he didn't start. 1/2 #SaturdayThoughts
2602 2018-12-22 17:09:00 #Investing lessons of 2018:

1. Avoid something like #bitcoin
2. Don't believe in #rumors
3. Never expect small & #midcaps to perform every year
4. Even if the fundamentals are good, #stocks may not perform in a year
5. No matter what you think, #market could sense it better!!
2603 2018-12-22 17:07:56 -Stocks hitting 52 week lows
-Government shutdown over lack of funding for a project you said Mexico would pay for
-Pulling troops out of Syria so it can further destabilize
#ResignTrump
2604 2018-12-22 17:05:57 I wish there was a way to tell EVERY WEBSITE that I don't give a shit about weddings, holiday baking, Robert Downey Jr, stocks, Christmas, babies, Christmas babies (aka Jesus), people's squads, foxes and wine. Never show me those things. What a wonderful world it would be.
2605 2018-12-22 17:05:24 Stocks crashing will be more hurtful to Trump than any foreign policy gaffe w/White professionals who voted for him... they won’t forget he killed the bull market. 401K’s dropping like rocks.
2606 2018-12-22 17:05:00 I’m still confused as to why they are called stocks
2607 2018-12-22 17:04:16 You're tweeting this while you could be evaluating your business model to try and stop your stocks from plummetting any further.
2608 2018-12-22 17:01:55 “You go to the market and there’s a bunch of stocks. US stocks are expensive. Chinese stocks are cheap. It’s Obama’s fault and why we’re locking up Hillary. Anyway, I’m invoking tariffs on Chinese stocks so they’ll be more expensive and US stocks won’t look as bad. MAGA.”
2609 2018-12-22 17:01:40 I'm curious, how much money did Trump Industries invest in steel stocks before you artificially inflated the price of steel?
2610 2018-12-22 17:01:24 "Hi, I'm a Trump voter! Voted for him because the wall. Instead of getting the wall, the trade war cost me my job, my stocks tanked & my healthcare premiums exploded. That's ok. I know the great orange business god has a plan. So I'm spending my own money to fund the wall. MAGA!"

2618 2018-12-22 16:57:13 FYI, in 2017, Gallup found 54% of respondents owned stocks either directly or as part of a fund. Fed says about 1/3  of families in lower half of income scale have stock; next 40% of income, about 70 percent of held stocks; top 10%  above 90% own stock.

2620 2018-12-22 16:56:27 What Facebook did not know is that their stocks are going to crash so much in 2018. Business is built on trust, as long as you have trust, you have money. If you lose trust, you lose reputation and money in no time.
2621 2018-12-22 16:56:24 @realDonaldTrump Correct, Powell seems to better trust ancient models than have economic business anticipation! Creating a stock avalanche a few hours before XMAS is downright stupid showing no empathy, nor for investors. Negating #MAGA !
!@! While in church had to sell stocks!
2622 2018-12-22 16:56:23 Maybe he's implying the wall street-afication of pot stocks is not the way for legalization to go. 

Just see the possibility of big pharma, big tobacco and the Alcohol industry buying up all the little pot stocks like candy.

Not that I endorse de Blabio in any form.
2623 2018-12-22 16:56:11 Bought some stocks, boosted my shares
2624 2018-12-22 16:55:50 No kidding. It's getting worse. And yes, I've been into politics for quite some years. The president is a lot to do with a lot of what's going on. Stocks have hit their lowest point in the Bull Market in 10 years. We were in a republican (Bush) recession. Tariffs are killing us.
2625 2018-12-22 16:55:40 Wow, I cant get anything pass you.  It was a stocks oriented forum back.
2626 2018-12-22 16:55:38 I trade alongside the market makers moves so to me it doesnt matter whether prices rally or free fall as long as theres enough risk reward at the end of the day. I've been loving all these free falls tho as 80% of my positions are shorts, even when trading stocks I like to fade
2627 2018-12-22 16:55:28 Anganwadi food distribution scam in Karnataka. I got hold of a "Pushti" grains packet distributed for children in Karnataka In the photo below you see how expiry date is smudged purposefully by the miscreants. The expired stocks are distributed in this fashion to school children
2628 2018-12-22 16:55:27 If political parties are traded in exchanges,

BJP - Multibagger. Stay long.
CONG - Technically looking weak. Further downside expected. Stay short.
AAP - Penny stock. No fundamentals. Don't trade.
CPI/CPM - Penny stocks. Will be delisted soon. No volume.
2629 2018-12-22 16:55:04 Yeah bear market will hit more. It’s really just starting. The OTC market stocks I have been in have outperformed all the blue chips since October.
2630 2018-12-22 16:55:04 $PRGO lot of stocks oversold but.. rsi at 10.. down 30% on assessment that usually takes yrs to litigate.!!  ..

2632 2018-12-22 16:54:09 I can attest to the value of free educational advice they have provided like learning 5 n 10 ma, looking at multiple time frames and focusing on few stocks that line up with set ups and cashing out gains instead of building account. Very grateful thank you  fellas.
2633 2018-12-22 16:54:04 @ffweekend @foxandfriends @PeteHegseth @JedediahBila Sen Shumer is the Grinch that stole XMAS for 19 MILLION AR-15 like rifle legal owners when he banned BUMP STOCKS. He obviously is clueless or don't care about We The People. BUMP STOCK has been used in ONLY ONE mass murder...
2634 2018-12-22 16:53:58 No doubt! You'll be hitting them the way you hit stocks. 
2635 2018-12-22 16:52:28 Definitely true but that didn't stop him from tweeting about it non-stop when stocks were doing well and taking credit for it
2636 2018-12-22 16:51:37 Today I have not bought anything from sweet ... only a poppy seed pie. I have stocks of chocolates, waffles and chocolates at home lol 
2637 2018-12-22 16:50:02 Sorry Chief.
Im about to dump all my real accouts, sell all Twitter stocks, and halt ALL advertising through this sinking ship.

Best of luck.
2638 2018-12-22 16:48:44 Excellent idea - double it up with forced divestment of stocks on election, so that corrupt congressmembers can't profit off their own co-option.
2639 2018-12-22 16:48:41 Glad you agree Greg and very well picked. At that time gold (and certainly gold stocks) were well out of favour. As an aside, your pick of the platinums has played out beautifully too (if I remember correctly).
2640 2018-12-22 16:48:40 As stocks suffer a December rout, Wall Street strategists bet on 2019 gains 
THERE ARE NO STRATEGISTS. JUST PEOPLE TRYING TO ENTICE YOU IN PARTING YOUR MONEY SO THAT THEY CAN SURVIVE. 2019 WILL BE A LOT WORSE AND COULD POSSIBLY LEAD TO DEPRESSION.
2641 2018-12-22 16:48:40 Bump stocks are for those who don’t have patience.
2642 2018-12-22 16:48:18 you'll hear contrasting market opinions.

 Some will say, the market is a buy because so many stocks' P/Es are looking very attractive. 
Others will say, that's nuts! Only when the Fed comes out and says "No more rate hikes" will stocks (and P/Es) stop falling.
2643 2018-12-22 16:48:17 What a lame comparison. Bitcoin went up 1000%+ in a short time entirely due to speculation. Stocks went up nowhere near that much and for actual reasons, like significantly increased earnings.
2644 2018-12-22 16:47:25 I been investing in stocks for over a year now
2645 2018-12-22 16:44:57 OMG I can hear that buzz beeping screeching, I remember 1200 buad, I actually trades stocks on a 56k line in 2000 - 2001..that was $25-50 a month. This article is a joke...
2646 2018-12-22 16:44:31 I voted for Gary Johnson. Trump is wrong on tariffs. Trump is wrong on the bump stocks ban. Trump is wrong on immigration. Trump is right on deregulation, cutting taxes and bringing the troops home.
2647 2018-12-22 16:44:29 He doesn’t believe in stocks.
2648 2018-12-22 16:44:23 See. The Dow was at 12,000 in 2012. It was at 26,000 just a week or so ago. Not as dramatic. Stocks are on sale now 
2649 2018-12-22 16:44:02 Now there's talk he wants to fire the chairman of the federal reserve ("the fed", as he likes to say). I think the logic goes like this:
"Stocks drop? Who can I fire... federal reserve is like money. That fed is BAD!! FIRE HIM NOW!"
2650 2018-12-22 16:43:25 @SNOOSNU @firefox2778 mostly holding lots of Chinese stocks and want to ride them up long term.  JD IQ BZUN SOGO NIO Trading LABU and YINN
2651 2018-12-22 16:43:01 Mark my word Tesla will be bought out or put out of business by ford & Audi when they enter the electric car market. Tesla’s stocks are already going to shit, investors are pissed off, can’t meet production dates, and they are almost the most unreliable car you can buy
2652 2018-12-22 16:41:54 That is exactly what Powell is fixing. The FED under Bernanke/Yellen created a gigantic bubble and Powell wants to stop this nonsense of cheap money forever. Stocks will find buyers ince they reach better valuations.
2653 2018-12-22 16:41:44 Those two abandoned their supposed MO values along ago and got rich from the grift; @RoyBlunt from NRA donations, @USRepLong from inside trading health stocks. Nobody should pretend they rep us in MO any longer.
2654 2018-12-22 16:41:40 They are all multimillionaires(except for you). Turning off their congressional salary would only be symbolic.  Should shut off their ability to trade stocks, access bank services, and money transfers from overseas. And take their passports away too.
2655 2018-12-22 16:40:25 Don’t let Navarro and Tariff Man off the hook. The 1, 2 punch of rate hikes and trade war is too much for stocks.
2656 2018-12-22 16:40:07 The Trump administration and the NRA have been against bump stocks for a long time. Where have you been? Welcome to the party.
2657 2018-12-22 16:39:26 wishing hard for this xoxo :  i got a msg on my lf listing , there was a local exo seller purchasing the pantone merch in sk,   and  she offered to help me get hyukjaes pc .. she said theres still stocks when she went today so fingers crossed tmr itll still be there
2658 2018-12-22 16:39:17 Wow both #stocks, and #Crypto is down guess going to have to invest in old elbow grease.
2659 2018-12-22 16:38:53 So today, December 21....stocks have the ugliest December since the Great Depression.   Yup really winning at home! 
2660 2018-12-22 16:38:46 ‘80 | Big chance! Stocks’ corner is headed wide by Bryant. Just too high for someone at the back post. 1-1
2661 2018-12-22 16:38:42 + Worst week in stocks since financial crisis of 2008
+ Worst December since the Great Depression
+ Tariff Man’s policies hurting industry and global trade
+ Government shutdown

Moron - no one won. Certainly not the people you represent.
2662 2018-12-22 16:38:08 Not many nasdaq stocks pay dividends!
2663 2018-12-22 16:37:38 Dear @realDonaldTrump: #stocks have had the ugliest December since the #greatdepression. You sure know what you are doing. Oh and now shutting the government down. #TrumpShutdown
2664 2018-12-22 16:37:24 But what about solid, consistent stocks that perform well year after year?
2665 2018-12-22 16:37:15 never dabbled much in investing in stocks but big on GOLD....But great info at the right price....
2666 2018-12-22 16:36:20 Lastest business and financial news on stocks indices commodities training session
2667 2018-12-22 16:36:15 The wall is a diversion to cover his wreckless actions that caused stocks on Wall Street.
It's his "go-to" move. Classic Trump smoke and mirrors. Sad.
2668 2018-12-22 16:35:46 Btw falling stocks are because of you and tariffs and trade wars, now shutting down the government. You're erratic and costing us trillions. My 401k hates you.
2669 2018-12-22 16:35:42 Our #Sale on Accessories in store still on…While Stocks Last!!!! .T&C’s Apply inc 25% off @tweethue #Hue @intuVictoriaCen
2670 2018-12-22 16:35:13 This is the worst December for stocks since the depression?
2671 2018-12-22 16:34:17 There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.(No.131) #Duo30L11
2672 2018-12-22 16:34:11 Taylor if you don’t know anything about stocks don’t talk. When you have highs you have lows. Sell offs happen more in December than any other month to balance your gains. If I were you I would not talk about the stock market that you have no knowledge in.
2673 2018-12-22 16:34:10 He better not walk back a word. What could kill credibility faster!?Think they knew stocks had a bit more downside.  Probably has assurances too from GS they’ll be buy $AAPL 150 area
2674 2018-12-22 16:32:51 Every bull run has few such funny bones.... Vakrangee PCJ Gitanjali 8k miles ... And also some fund managers crop up on turnaround themes ... Few years after the bull run both the fund managers and their turnaround stocks have turned around...
2675 2018-12-22 16:31:59 If the article dates were swapped it would in fact be fake....
I’m all behind the fake news being fake but opinion pieces are one thing and faceted based pieces entirely another.
The recent poor POOR decision of @realDonaldTrump to make bump stocks illegal has garnered “negative”
2676 2018-12-22 16:31:40 #45’s decisions have caused a roller coaster economy. End results will be recession then depression. Consider bonds more than stocks. #45BadAtBusiness
2677 2018-12-22 16:31:29 They only care about the dividends from their war stocks.
2678 2018-12-22 16:31:20 If u play ultimate on wifi and ur setting are 2 stocks 6 mins ur obviously fucking stupid and ur mom never showed u any love.
2679 2018-12-22 16:31:14 I just want to give a round of applause to Trump for pulling us out of Syria and Afghanistan, and banning bump stocks. The old democrat in him is showing 
2680 2018-12-22 16:29:43 Govt shutdown=REAL
Syria Pullout=REAL
Mattis quit=REAL
McGurk quit=REAL
Stocks down=REAL
Your Presidency=FAKE
2681 2018-12-22 16:29:19 MR.TRUMP,I HOPE THIS TIME YOU WILL MAKE A GOOD PICK FOR CHEIF OF STAFF,DO NOT,PICK SOMEONE,RYAN,MCCONNELL,OR CNN APPROVES OF,THAT SHOULD BE A RED FLAG!
I HOPE YOU WILL PICK A COMMENDER,WHO RESIGNED UNDER THE OBAMA REGIME,ALSO ONE WHO DOESN'T HAVE STOCKS IN THE WAR MACHINE!
2682 2018-12-22 16:29:09 @realDonaldTrump wants to fire the Fed Chairman because of his raising the interest Rates, causing the Stock Market to react. But the real Problem is Tariffs, Trump Lies, Pulling out of Syria, indictments and future indictments did more damage on Stocks.  The one to fire is YOU.
2683 2018-12-22 16:29:06 Wondering if President wants the shutdown so the stocks will plummet, then he can seize the opportunity for Trump Tower to invest and make money out of it? 
2684 2018-12-22 16:28:49 Agreed, I've been surprised by the resilience of ust's given the rollover in stocks but longer term I think US deficits & debt will matter. Anyways - I enjoy your tweets!
2685 2018-12-22 16:28:35 You: “I’ll take ‘Secret Signal to Buy Stocks’ for $300, Alex.”
Alex: [Reading Clue] “CNBC.”
You: “Uh, everything?”
Ding ding ding!
2686 2018-12-22 16:28:29 everything is FAKE but @realDonaldTrump    shhhhhhh the bear market is not FAKE.  uncertainty kills stocks, thanks lil don john.
2687 2018-12-22 16:28:13 The organization which just pushed for banning bump stocks wants no restrictions? Stop lying.
2688 2018-12-22 16:27:41 @sahneydeepak  sir any impact on tyre stocks on Monday following cut in gst rates?
2689 2018-12-22 16:27:05 You didn't negotiate with the Democrats when gave $1.5 Trillion in tax cuts to wealthy corporations who either laid off their workers or bought back stocks!! Please stop acting like you give a damn about border security and pay those federal employees!! #ResignTrump
2690 2018-12-22 16:26:56 So, do I keep my daughter’s $5000 (or what WAS $5000 initially) in stocks or pull it out and put it in a CD? We’d planned on this gift growing & wanted her to have more money after she graduates next year. I’m not prepared!
2691 2018-12-22 16:26:50 Who really cares. Banks only loan money to BIG CORPORATIONS so they can buy up those stocks that others are dumping. They call that Corporate Fascism.
However the economy is as bad as it is because, people with no money aren't buying the shit they produce anyway. So Job losses.
2692 2018-12-22 16:26:40 Trade wars that hurt the economy, trickle down style tax cut scam, exploding the deficit and plummeting stocks isn't what I have in mind.
2693 2018-12-22 16:26:18 Ooooooff the stocks are not doing so well :/
2694 2018-12-22 16:25:33 Time to buy stocks 
2695 2018-12-22 16:24:14 It's the perfect week - stocks on sale!
2696 2018-12-22 16:24:09 When was there such steep quarterly drops in the stocks market.  In the last 3 months: 
Dow - down 14% 
S&P - down 16% 
NASDAQ - down 18%  
Transportation - down 19% 
Contact trump & republicans over the Holidays to let them know what you think.   @GOP @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @DNC
2697 2018-12-22 16:23:20 What I read the individual state  may ban bump stocks by the bill signed by Trump not on a Federal level.
2698 2018-12-22 16:23:15 Get in ... now for stocks to get the winner and his hat-trick 
2699 2018-12-22 16:22:37 Jui éclat à stbrieuc derrière le géant ya 1 petit vieux qui joue de la cornemuse genre comme ca derrière les stocks
2700 2018-12-22 16:22:33 Stocks or Real Estate?  My answer to this question below.
2701 2018-12-22 16:22:30 Republicans didn't give a damn about the wall when they gave $1.5 Trillion to wealthy corporations who either laid off their workers or bought back stocks.. now almost 900,000 American federal employees will not be paid this holiday season.. trump stole Christmas! #ResignTrump
2702 2018-12-22 16:21:51 "HOW DO I FIRE THE STOCK MARKET?" (said in a murderous rage). "You can't, Mr. President, it is a group of non-governmental owners of stocks.  "FAKE NEWS! WELL YOU'RE FIRED! BRING ME RUDY NOW!"
2703 2018-12-22 16:21:22 “Making Stocks Low Again”
2704 2018-12-22 16:20:31 It's about time NIFTY corrects. P/E is too high and stocks are overvalued. Recent +INR and -OIL has pushed it even higher. I feel its DEC17/JAN18 all over again, except for mid/small caps.
2705 2018-12-22 16:20:08 Damage is done when people lose their home and jobs.  Right now, stocks are down, but once they see what congress is going to do, as well as the Feds with the interest rates. 2019 will bounce back.  Pray I’m right n have a nice day.
2706 2018-12-22 16:19:52 Lekin business stocks inflation dollar invesyments reserves everything going decline and the life of common man has been worst millions of people jobless sir do some extra ordinary work

2708 2018-12-22 16:17:56 The Saudi government has been found buying its own stocks when their market is down to rally results. I’m not surprised. I can’t see how anyone or any country can be so prosperous without an underlying (illegal) strategy.
2709 2018-12-22 16:17:51 The worst week for stocks since 2008, a Government shutdown, National debt soaring, Gun deaths in America reaching record highs, Cost of Healthcare rising, Cost of college rising, Global warming, General Mattis out, and a death of a child in US boarder custody.

Today’s America
2710 2018-12-22 16:17:26 It’s different this time. If the economy begins to contract while stocks continue their path into a bear market, while all 17 investigations gain steam, Trump’s support will take a hit.
2711 2018-12-22 16:15:56 @GreggsOfficial I am absolutely  appalled by service I received. I asked for a sausage roll which was in the oven that I could see, was to wait 6 mins but woman said I couldnt buy as stocks was limited & to queue up again hoping I was lucky" surely this is not acceptable service?
2712 2018-12-22 16:15:01 We at Myntra believe in providing great deals and discounts. But, discounted price on our range is time-based and is limited till the stocks last. So do keep an eye out for the best available price. -AJ

2714 2018-12-22 16:14:39 Pricking bubbles always hurts. They wouldn't be bubbles otherwise. 

However the dot com bubble was limited to tech stocks, the 2007 was house (you couldn't buy but you could rent at least), this one is everything.
2715 2018-12-22 16:14:19 COLONIAL SOCIETY stocks rallying
2716 2018-12-22 16:14:02 re: "all-out insane euphoria." 

Okay. Maybe. But not every long-term top is marked by abject euphoria. 

We've been treated to such spectacles as shorting vol at 9, selling leveraged naked calls, growth stocks trading at 200-300x, and many other hints at euphoria.
2717 2018-12-22 16:13:26 Kung may stocks pa po next year 
2718 2018-12-22 16:12:28 Stocks at record lows. That’s wild. Glad we got a business genius in office
2719 2018-12-22 16:11:49 Our finanancial advisor advised us he's now dropping bonds and buying stocks b/c of how low the dow has dropped. He had a #, and we reached it this week. Hope he's right. Losing money b/c of another republican brings back bad memories.
2720 2018-12-22 16:11:36 They said they're working on it.

If they do bring it on I'd consider activating the USD account and look into US stocks as well.
2721 2018-12-22 16:11:32 $WUC $LAM $GXU $FCU $EFR ....my portfolio has more in it but in terms of % invested it’s these 5 that are the largest with $WUC being my main choice. I hold a smaller % in ‘safer’ U stocks as a core back up if the riskier ones fall over.
2722 2018-12-22 16:11:19 Bump stocks
2723 2018-12-22 16:11:14 So, politicians on social media are only responsible for when stocks go up? Got it.
2724 2018-12-22 16:10:37 Most of #Cryptotwitter is on the concensus that the bear market isnt over until most alt coins are dead and that we need a bitcoin rally without altcoins rallying even further. I disagree. The most profitable stocks can bottom prior to the end of an Index fund.
2725 2018-12-22 16:09:43 @realDonaldTrump must be blind to his market call of Dow overvaluation at 17,000 prior to election and pump at 27,000.  He is blind to a 10 year vertical run and is blind to the notion of valuation.  Corrections are normal so cheer them Donald.  And, you know zilch about stocks
2726 2018-12-22 16:09:35 This is 1987 in slow motion... slash of rich people’s paper wealth. Rest of society oblivious. They don’t own stocks and never cared about the rise only cared about stagnant wages and rising healthcare which have been in place before rise and now
2727 2018-12-22 16:09:30 So um... Who bought stocks to hold over the weekend? 
2728 2018-12-22 16:08:20 DONALD J TRUMP 

Took a Senate appropriation bill that passed 100 - 0

And fumbled the ball at the goal line.  
Sound familiar, Hugh?

TRUMP party owns the Shutdown 

ALL OF IT

Stocks tanking, the interest rates rising, the Flynn treason, the blatant stooge for AG

2739 2018-12-22 16:06:25 I’m a troll? You’re just a critic who can’t hold a candle to who you criticize. Trump earned it the hard way wheeling and dealing. I guess you respect more the billionaires who got that way because their stocks went to the moon thanks to Wallsteet. How long did Amazon loose $ ?
2740 2018-12-22 16:06:24 Volatility aside tax loss harvesters are pushing a lot of the value stocks to attractive yields... Christmas to NYE will be an interesting time
2741 2018-12-22 16:05:56 Scared to look at my stocks.
2742 2018-12-22 16:05:51 Go back to smuggling bump stocks.
2743 2018-12-22 16:05:51 Just imagine, Trump is a businessman, what if he is crashing the Dow to buy cheaper stocks and bonds to only rise the Dow again with new policies all while smiling with his arms crossed and getting richer and richer by the day#ResignTrump

2745 2018-12-22 16:05:04 Businesses especially those publically traded have no reason to pay more than what they have to to keep their stocks up. The people who make the money are those who bought stock. The average person does not buy stock.

2750 2018-12-22 16:04:21 That's right. HE. He is to blame, not the firearm, not the bump stock. He. Those weapons could have sit there all day, complete with bump stocks and not hurt anybody. Put the blame where it belongs.
2751 2018-12-22 16:04:17 He also said now is the time to buy stocks. Of course, he was saying the same thing three months ago. What a moron
2752 2018-12-22 16:04:14 You disagree? Friend me and when he is fired and stocks tumble, don’t say I didn’t warn you.
2753 2018-12-22 16:01:01 J'ai essayé d'estimer les stocks dispo chez Philibert et je pense que j'ai encore quelques mois devant moi pour décider si je veux tenter de me lancer dans une 2ème campagne en parallèle de celle de mon groupe.

2767 2018-12-22 15:57:03 Disagree. Oil is being devalued, other commodities following or will follow, and stocks reflect that devaluation.
2768 2018-12-22 15:55:34 Problem is stocks used to drive economy now, so only a matter of time before data reflects effects.

What a Fall we have endured.  Badgers, Packers and stocks.
2773 2018-12-22 15:52:42 Bump stocks for everyone!
2774 2018-12-22 15:52:38 The only relief valve for the stock market is the dollar IMHO. Until the dollar reverses stocks remain at high risk although conditions are grossly oversold. So a bounce soon should be expected.
2775 2018-12-22 15:52:36 @realDonaldTrump @chris7781924

I know exactly what happened because it's happened before.

It's called pump and dump. You buy your own stocks, pump up the price and then dump them.

It should be illegal. But thanks to Ronald "Mcdonald" Reagan, it's not.

2818 2018-12-22 15:36:41 I’m developing my plan for next week NOW!  Multiple scenarios for multiple stocks.  Finding what I would buy/sell at the lowest risk depending on what each stock does.  And you’re playing xbox, that’s why I’m beating you
2819 2018-12-22 15:36:28 The disastrous Fed rate increase is on you, #POTUS, as you appointed Powell and you could have fired him for cause on October 3rd when he tanked the markets by violating normal Fed Chair practice (Greenspan) of not discussing future rate increases.#Stocks #Fed #FirePowell
2820 2018-12-22 15:36:21 I was thinking along these lines. It seems intuitive if the Fed is still so hawkish why would bonds have a bid? Then we have the problem where bonds and stocks rose in tandem, if they fall in tandem where is the capital going?
2821 2018-12-22 15:34:49 Jokes aside, I’ve essentially got 20 years. I’ll be 45 in May (yikes). I’m also largely stocks thus far and I’m just not looking at the carnage this year, no matter the cause. I’ve got Netflix if I want to watch a horror flick.
2822 2018-12-22 15:34:37 Trump doesn’t even want to go to mar a lago, worst December in stocks since Great Depression, who there does he want to face??
2823 2018-12-22 15:34:13 To the contrary soldiers come with a code of discipline that civilians clearly lack. Soldiers have been very successful with OWC and Fisheries. The bumper harvests and fish stocks are clear evidence.
2824 2018-12-22 15:34:05 Did you join the #cannabis revolution yet?

It is not to late to make extreme profits. Avoid the naysayers. This is our time. #Hemp will change the world.

These are the #stocks I am watching + many others.

2825 2018-12-22 15:33:01 1v1 people really should be putting at least 5 minutes if they're doing 3 or more stocks.
2826 2018-12-22 15:32:59 I don't think a partial gov shutdown will push stocks lower. I think that is what Friday was all about combined with Navarro opening his big mouth about China.
2827 2018-12-22 15:31:38 Eh. Keep doing those prop bets over time you’ll likely lose badly. Keep investing in stocks over time you’ll likely win bigly.  The key is OVER TIME.
2828 2018-12-22 15:31:34 My sister teaching me about stocks & I feel like a jit again when she used to help me wit my homework 
2829 2018-12-22 15:31:30 I have stocks, thanks. Buying stocks isn’t getting in the industry from the ground, it’s picking crumbs and slices from someone else’s business venture. That’s not going to help average people, idiot.
2830 2018-12-22 15:30:39 I have been lectured by republicans about how good Trump would be for the country and the economy. Their motives, of course, were racism and greed. Now that their stocks are tanking, I wonder what they think? Which is more important - racism or greed? #TrumpChristmasShutdown
2831 2018-12-22 15:30:25 Massive curve steepening is probably not good for stocks (and credit) but I hear ya on the rest to some degree
2832 2018-12-22 15:30:14 (2/2) ...we've found in our post-mortem work on mistakes that one of the best ways to lose money over time is by owning stocks with changing investment rationales. - Ragen Stienke
2833 2018-12-22 15:30:14 Unfortunately I'm young enough that I'm basically 100% stocks, yet old enough to have enough saved that it stings to lose. NOT GREAT BOB.
2834 2018-12-22 15:30:04 All you do is golf, no wonder the stocks are tanking, you are Putin’s puppet, Gov’t shutdown, and Mattis quitting.  Please do America a favor and resign.  Please.  That is my Christmas wish, please resign.
2835 2018-12-22 15:29:46 I also recall before the EU, the UK had overfished UK waters so much, they had to go an poach fish from Icelandic waters in the cod wars. At least the EU CFP allowed fish stocks to build up again.
2836 2018-12-22 15:29:23 And again, the stocks collapse is politcal, not a function of the engine. Energy is a tug-of-war between our production and the world.
2837 2018-12-22 15:29:19 STOCKS WORST WEEK IN DECADE... 

 Nearly every investment in red...

 GDP Revised Lower To 3.4%...

 Cashin prediction:  FED MAY CUT!
2838 2018-12-22 15:28:37 For me, my education. At 32 going back to school for Business and sporting a 4.0 currently. Not only educating myself on that though reading everything I can on fitness, stocks, entreneurship, and reading blogs like yours. Knowledge brings power. 
2839 2018-12-22 15:27:58 Sometimes I lay awake at night in my bed, wondering where I'd be in life if I had invested my confirmation money in viable stocks instead of splerging on Spider-Man and WWE action figures...
2840 2018-12-22 15:27:57 , it really drives me nuts to see these pansies demand more loosening. Stocks selling is the best thing that ever happened to Main Street. Rates going up is a gift to savers. Only casino players want more chips. A looser FED does not help Main Street
2841 2018-12-22 15:27:55 Apparently you hadn’t realized when interest is low, stocks grow. When interest is high, stocks die.
2842 2018-12-22 15:27:38 Oh good God!  Anyone who invests in stocks knows the risk.  Pres Trump doesn’t owe u a guarantee on a risk investment.  Get over yourself.

2845 2018-12-22 15:25:54 Ok, stocks are at the middle of a crash, but CBOE equity put/call ratio is finally at severe panic levels. The breadth is very oversold. Any low will have to be tested, and first rallies will be sold, but the market can have a short squeeze or a dead-cat bounce soon... $SPX
2846 2018-12-22 15:25:47 Fire him! But do it after Americans buy the hell out of the fallen stocks so we can see them skyrocket!!
2847 2018-12-22 15:25:25 Stocks tanking; no SecDef, SecState, real AG, or Chief of Staff; Govt shut down; families torn apart at border with children dying in our custody.  We warned that Trump was dangerous.  What else needs to happen before everyone else catches on?
2848 2018-12-22 15:25:10 Invested 3000 EUR in bank stocks, at low (at least I thought so) returned after 7 years, my protfolio costed 9 EUR. Thanks to splitting.

Stock market is too slow, and bear market for some shares can last decades.
2849 2018-12-22 15:24:58 And we are told this is the Great Negotiator? He is The Great Loser and so is America as long as he is in office! Worst December for stocks since the great depression!
2850 2018-12-22 15:24:55 Can’t argue the data, question is: is the mkt sniffing out what we be weak data in the future?Stocks peaked well before data went south/recession showed up (Oct 2007, 2000). The data no bullish strategist cites: the debt binge the world has gone on. Got to digest that eventually
2851 2018-12-22 15:24:42 “It’s really hard to get a recession when the labor market is strong, wages are going up, business investment is going up, [and] government spending is going up,” said El-Erian, Allianz’ chief economic advisor.

2852 2018-12-22 15:24:20 Lol trump has turned the markets into penny stocks. When they reach the Obama levels wallstreet will be dying for a replacement
2853 2018-12-22 15:24:03 The only people putting national security at risk are you and the crazed neocons who are addicted to illegal wars to fund your arms company stocks.
2854 2018-12-22 15:23:57 And we are told this is the Great Negotiator? He is The Great Loser and so is America as long as he is in office! Worst December for stocks since the great depression!
2855 2018-12-22 15:23:54 Or maybe I should buy small cap stocks like O’Leary recommended so I can lose 30%.
2856 2018-12-22 15:23:53 Does Trump think that we need a wall on the southern border so the Mexicans won’t come across the border & sell their stocks before the market crashes?

I’m sure they can do that without physically traveling here.

That’d be like closing the barn door after the horses ran off.
2857 2018-12-22 15:23:46 Stocks in digging equipment and ladders are gonna skyrocket if the wall is funded. #uselessWall
2858 2018-12-22 15:23:21 @CNN talking head Stephen Moore is an idiot.

On @CNN, he just said “Fed should hold an emergency meeting next week and reverse the hike”

That would advertise that they are in panic.

Stocks would be limit down every day for weeks.
2859 2018-12-22 15:23:15 And we are told this is the Great Negotiator? He is The Great Loser and so is America as long as he is in office! Worst December for stocks since the great depression!
2860 2018-12-22 15:22:55 #Facebook stocks continue to drop after millions leave the network over privacy concerns.
2861 2018-12-22 15:22:44 First Step Act.  Bump stocks.
2862 2018-12-22 15:22:28 Yet 47 members of #GOP & Pence were willing to spend an atrocious $5B on a wall that all experts say is not the best solution (& taxpayers were promised Mexico would pay for) knowing that social security & Medicaid would be gutted next – while deficit at highest & stocks lowest?
2863 2018-12-22 15:22:03 And we are told this is the Great Negotiator? He is The Great Loser and so is America as long as he is in office! Worst December for stocks since the great depression!
2864 2018-12-22 15:22:00 Stocks on sale!  I love it!
2865 2018-12-22 15:21:54 What I’ve noticed throughout the investing community is a need to place the blame for this downdraft in stocks. I’m still constructive on the US economy and bullish in general, but I also understand that stocks go down..sometimes a lot..and for lots of reasons.
2866 2018-12-22 15:21:07 Once we have an up day the market will be driven higher by FOMO and FOMO alone. #StockMarket #stock #stocks
2867 2018-12-22 15:20:18 with financial institutions who spend billions in total buying TBs and lending to civil servants whom they know are going to payback because of SSB orders rather than lending to company's and buying stocks because they feel that they are likely to fail and struggle to pay back
2868 2018-12-22 15:19:50 flower stocks are edgy
2869 2018-12-22 15:19:23 Cramer is a "JOKE" (IMHO). He said "I am going to call a low (bottom) with bank stocks". Then the bank's proceeded to collapse, in 2008. Cramer is clueless and a cheerleader (IMHO). Oh yeah..Thank Barney Frank also. Frank said everything looks good...that statement was pure B.S.
2870 2018-12-22 15:19:16 That’s fine.  Deficit balloons under Repubs/Dems anyway.  Nat debt too.  If stocks go up/down for individuals who decided to invest their money, that’s how it goes.  Glad individuals can keep more of what they earn, even if it isn’t a lot each week/month.  Their money.
2871 2018-12-22 15:19:02 Have you been following the stock market lately?  It's a wonderful time to get in, -*- provided -*- you buy well diversified sound dividend paying stuff with resources you won't need to pay your bills with.  Hint: stocks are tumbling but the economic fundamentals are good.
2872 2018-12-22 15:18:55 Fox News reporting that Trump has discussed firing #JeromePowell.  JamesBullard would be an excellent replacement as he has been St. Louis Fed chair since 2008 and publicly argued for pausing prior to disastrous Dec. meeting. #FirePowell #BullardFedChair #Fed #Stocks #Crash
2873 2018-12-22 15:18:32 Invest in value stocks , in the real economy I’m so frustrated that technology stocks get so overvalued and everything else goes down because of them. For example Snap gets coverage on CNBC but no value stocks.
2874 2018-12-22 15:18:21 So someone tried to break into my Robinhood to (assumably) steal all $14 I have in stocks. There's a Prince John stealing from the poor joke somewhere in there and I'm just too tired to make it.
2875 2018-12-22 15:17:33 It's the worst Dec for stocks since 1931.
2876 2018-12-22 15:16:58 It's deeply, deeply funny to me that stocks crashing sent just enough people fleeing into bitcoin for holders who watched their stash decline by almost a power of ten this year to get out on a small bump up
2877 2018-12-22 15:16:40 @AnnCoulter wishing you a dark and horrible Christmas like the families effected by the shutdown that you and your other Racists pushed Your Pres the petulant Child to do . By the way how are your stocks doing tanking thanks to your buddies big biz knowledge your pathetic
2878 2018-12-22 15:16:24 does Evo keep back stocks of old magazines? only asking as one my mates found out about red Victor when you did a tuned/drag car edition, I think the main focus was a ruf GT3 but I'm not 100% on that @DickieMeaden
2879 2018-12-22 15:16:23 Funny thing is, if stocks went up, they'd probably credit Obama and accuse Trump of benefiting from BO's economic policies. Too predictable.
2880 2018-12-22 15:15:01 Yield Curve: inverted
Stocks: down
Fed Chairman: fired
Yep.. it's recession time
2881 2018-12-22 15:13:54 Remember when the Trump people credited Trump for rising stocks .... awfully quiet these days
2882 2018-12-22 15:13:47 NOBODY, even those with retirement accounts, has to hold stocks.  It's your decision.  Talk to your investment advisors
2883 2018-12-22 15:13:38 Non, les stocks sont suffisants :) merci de ne pas en apporter et privilégier les produits qu’on a indiqué
2884 2018-12-22 15:13:27 Just watching Fox Business and all the stocks are down including Best Buy which I can't understand as we just bought two new Samsung TVs from them .  Sorry. I am thinking like a a democrate. 
2885 2018-12-22 15:13:23 Yesterday, in a desperate attempt to lower my cost basis in $AMZN, I threw on a put butterfly on Jan expiration 1350/1360x2/1370. Cost $0.25 DR, and is currently up  $2.31.

I feel this may be a solid strategy in this bear market, particularly tech stocks.

Thoughts?
2886 2018-12-22 15:12:55 Stocks plunged as CDW Corporation unveiled a wonderful box of chocolates today.
2887 2018-12-22 15:12:47 Top 1% of Americans own 80% of the stocks.
2888 2018-12-22 15:12:43 @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @WhiteHouse @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems @seanhannity a person with enough stock in the market could sell off take their profits causing others to follow drive stock prices down then buy cheap.Making a fortune. Stocks rise and they start again
2889 2018-12-22 15:12:23 the most uneducated people truly believe they are educated....thats a scary sight. Common sense is not so common , the unknown is even worse. Usually end up being laughing stocks
2890 2018-12-22 15:12:22 Je me sens parfaitement légitime pour délivrer les médicaments de mes patients chez moi et gérer mes stocks
2891 2018-12-22 15:11:55 The @gop @realDonaldTrump and the @NRA with very little public pressure because of one unverified incident supported and legalized a ban on bump stocks. Giving in to the libs once again at a cost of our right to self defense. Ashamed and appalled  #2AShallNotBeInfringed
2892 2018-12-22 15:11:52 Teach safety & push for bump stocks...  You have no credibility here bruh. Walk on
2893 2018-12-22 15:11:26 I have a great conspiracy theory... The @gop comes in and destroys the stock market so they can buy stocks at a steal, knowing the market will eventually go back up.
2894 2018-12-22 15:11:18 There's no doubt that there are some hard cases, but one has to prioritise one's spending. eg the "rent to buy" shop near me stocks 65" Ultra HD TVs. Who *needs* a 65" UHD TV if they're having to use "rent to buy"?
2895 2018-12-22 15:10:56 Despite pressure on stocks at the end of this week 30 yr unable to maintain highs in price. Seems there’s quite a bit of offer side liquidity up here. Seems to me the short squeeze has run its course and gov deficits and yields vs E/P will define next move.
2896 2018-12-22 15:10:54 Adam, come on dude. Consumer confidence is more than it has been in the past 40 years spending by regular Joe is up more than it has been in 40 years who cares about what's going on with the stocks. Regular men, like you and I don't even have a dog in that fight
2897 2018-12-22 15:09:44 Worst week for stocks in a decade and 800,000 federal employees not getting paid. Happy #Trumpmas everyone!
2898 2018-12-22 15:08:47 Stocks are lowest its speed since GD, Interest rates Are increasing, GOP leaders are resigning, Our allies no longer trusts us. Please do the honorable thing #TrumpResign
2899 2018-12-22 15:08:37 J'ai découvert comment filtrer les résultats d'aliexpress par entrepôt. Donc maintenant j'ai tous les stocks Allemand  directement. Tellement de trucs intéressants et si peu de budget. Raaaaaaaaa.
2900 2018-12-22 15:07:57 market participants can’t afford to be as emotional about these things as you seem to be. A better monetary policy strategy is bullish for asset markets. And everyone knows Fed Independence has always been a myth.  But go ahead and dump all your stocks when Powell gets canned...
2901 2018-12-22 15:07:14 Hard to swallow pills...

Barak Hussein Obama defended the 2nd Amendment better than Donald J Trump.

PS: I got bump stocks available.... ain't gonna be cheap though. DM me.
2902 2018-12-22 15:06:54 Moi j’aimais bien au début après j’ai décroché quand y’a eu tout ce qui est écriture comptable sur les stocks etc sinon c’était bien wesh
2903 2018-12-22 15:06:49 Aren't these the cosplay socialist kids so mad Obama didn't lock up every WS bank for creating housing/credit bubbles are now why so bad to fire someone who refuses to manipulate monetary policy give stocks a put?
2904 2018-12-22 15:06:42 How can one man fuck up the economy, the farming industry, government, give tax breaks to big businesses to buy back stocks and relations with our allies?..#WorstPresidentEver #ResignTrump @realDonaldTrump
2905 2018-12-22 15:06:17 In the go go 90s, no one outside of politics, much less those following the go go markets, cared about the Clinton impeachment. Politics !=> stocks. @CNN
2906 2018-12-22 15:06:04 Desperation is a feeling that exists irrespective of policy, though it can inform it
2907 2018-12-22 15:05:50 When you have quantitative easing (free money) for 8 yrs and health stocks reflecting their dependency on tax payer subsidies its easy to bloat the stock market.
2908 2018-12-22 15:05:34 You don’t know anything about what other transactions would affect his returns... so that is a statement you can’t know is true.. What other stocks dropped that month, who was making yearend changes...
2909 2018-12-22 15:05:01 Oh , and stocks are plummeting, Gen Mattes is abandoning me for my foolish decisions based on the recommendations of Conservative pundits instead of military leaders, and Mueller is getting ready to indict another one of my closest friends.... hand me the fiddle.
2910 2018-12-22 15:04:48 gold prices falling (all stocks, really), loss of jobs, a freaking wall, and military members without pay

all from the party that's whole platform is economic security, job growth, correct usage of government funds, and growth of military. makes sense.
2911 2018-12-22 15:04:05 If Trump fires Powell to pump up stocks, it would be highly destabilizing for global markets. The ultimate irony...
2912 2018-12-22 15:04:02 In the 70s, Nixon, middle east and gas lines, China, Kissinger, and politics were big stories that people followed closely. So yes politics => stocks. @CNN.
2913 2018-12-22 15:01:56 Kanang tao nga magplastar sa stocks HAHAHA ayna
2914 2018-12-22 15:01:06 "crypto" will collapse over the next decade.  Bitcoin alone will outperform stocks over the next decade.
#Bitcoin, not blockchain
#BTC, not "crypto"
2915 2018-12-22 15:00:40 Trump supporters don’t seem to care that bump stocks were banned. If Obama did this, you all would lose your minds. What’s next? Large capacity magazines?
2916 2018-12-22 15:00:11 "only reason they could possibly comprehend". Sure you are not as naive as to to underestimate the media. They know exactly what they are doing they just need to place this one on Trump and omit market cycle talk. Idiot Trump also played into it gauging his successes with stocks.
2917 2018-12-22 14:58:25 *3 government shutdowns in a year

*Stocks tanking

*Defense Secretary resigning in protest

*No permanent Chief of Staff

At some point, the media needs to start asking whether the president should resign.
2918 2018-12-22 14:57:57 Hi
2919 2018-12-22 14:57:37 stocks which moved up may not be having paper as a suffix.

Few Analyst talk about it !
2920 2018-12-22 14:57:35 So the secret is to purchase stocks as close to the end as possible...
2921 2018-12-22 14:56:57 It is not exactly as good a scoop as ITN flying a helicopter over power stations to film the huge coal stocks during the 3 day week before the 1974 election is it?

2924 2018-12-22 14:56:12 @Abhishekkar_ good evening sir, can you pl tell why 4-5 govt stocks like BPCL, coal india, NTPC, powergrid were trading in green despite the fact that 45 stocks of nifty 50 was in red. 
And thanks for being helping us through your tweets.
2925 2018-12-22 14:55:54 @realDonaldTrump Dear Mr. President, friend.  Concerning bump stocks. Our founding fathers were equally armed with the British army. Do you think our founding fathers would’ve been disarmed. 2A is defense from tyranny. U don’t disarm the police because of a bad cop.

2928 2018-12-22 14:53:46 Trumps impact:
+ Worst week in stocks since financial crisis of 2008
+ Worst December since the Great Depression
+ Tariff Man’s policies hurting industry and global trade
+ Government shutdown
2929 2018-12-22 14:53:02 Yup...having the courage to accumulate the right stocks in a bear market...will always gibe great rewards during the next bull run.

But the challange is to no one know how long will it take for the bull market to come!
2930 2018-12-22 14:51:42 Stocks are falling now do to Trumps stupid ideas. Tariffs are killing us, way too much uncertainty because other world leaders don't trust Trump. Dude, Stop watching Fox propaganda news & look around! We're going backwards. The Great Deal Maker's a total FRAUD/CON-MAN! FACT!
2931 2018-12-22 14:51:13 What catches my eye is that you seem to think that a regulator owning mutual funds and index funds is somehow the ethical equivalent of a regulator owning individual bank stocks? That’s pretty out there.
2932 2018-12-22 14:51:03 US stocks suffered one of the worst weekly falls in a decade as trade tensions with China, interest rate rises and a possible government shutdown rattled markets.
2933 2018-12-22 14:51:00 I know many Trump supporters who have 401(k)s, other retirement accounts, and who own stocks. My point is that their support begins to waiver as the economy and the markets falter.
2934 2018-12-22 14:50:44 yeah, I have zero financial background and I feel I know more about this space than my regular stocks advisors
2935 2018-12-22 14:50:31 HEY @FieldYates I wasn't going to do correct you after your first @RobinhoodApp live-read but since you've done it a few times since, I feel you may want to know. Robinhood offers ETF's, not ETFS. ETFs, short for EXCHANGE TRADED FUNDS, are collections of stocks that trade as such
2936 2018-12-22 14:50:30 US stocks suffered one of the worst weekly falls in a decade as trade tensions with China, interest rate rises and a possible government shutdown rattled markets.
2937 2018-12-22 14:50:26 Stocks typically don't react to government shutdowns. I used to be a federal civilian employee who even saw previous shutdowns. Markets didn't react to them.
2938 2018-12-22 14:50:03 Absolutely full of crap.  Why would there be a shortage. There is a big world out there not connected to the Eu we can buy from all over the world  to keeps stocks up. Also there is a great invention called an aeroplane so if they want to shut our ports down we can fly stuff in.
2939 2018-12-22 14:49:58 Question for all of my followers: 

I’m 26 years old. My current retirement account is 10% stocks and 90% cash. Roughly $25k. 

If you had to deploy that cash on Monday, how would you do so?
2940 2018-12-22 14:49:10 When you own a stock that has increased more than a 100% you can’t sell it as you pay 30% capital gains. 

Stocks tend to have 0-85% haircuts from time to time. That’s life. .
2941 2018-12-22 14:49:04 Hopefully from May 2019 these services will run longer and not stop at stations are smaller platforms. Subject to availability of stocks.

2943 2018-12-22 14:48:34 Here comes the Trump Slump:
+ Worst week in stocks since financial crisis of 2008
+ Worst December since the Great Depression
+ Tariff Man’s policies hurting industry and global trade
+ Government shutdown #TrumpChristmasShutdown2018
2944 2018-12-22 14:48:07 Sadly we have sold out of Airpods but we have lots in our 15% off Accessory sale and also 25% off Philips Hue, grab a bargain whilst stocks last #Christmas #KRCSDerby
2945 2018-12-22 14:47:29 The stocks were fine (albeit inflated due to #GOPTaxScam) until the economic uncertainties from the tariffs kicked in.  Fears over the prospects of Mr. Trump's government shutdown added fuel.
2946 2018-12-22 14:47:23 what I'm looking for this week: stocks that have not capitulated yet as possible downside plays & those deeply oversold for possible bounce
2947 2018-12-22 14:47:18 Hurry hurry while stocks last.
Xmas rush

2948 2018-12-22 14:46:43 For the sake of my retirement account balance, I sincerely hope that Bull will wake up ASAP. I didn’t sell off my stocks despite heavy loses in last two months, so now I’m stuck.
2949 2018-12-22 14:46:33 We have to continue to fight 4 gun reform. It has to be finished. Bump stocks is just the tip of the iceberg.
2950 2018-12-22 14:46:17 “Auto-pilot” means he’s trying to wean the patient off the drip regardless of the implications.  It’s a Volcker-like stance with broad implications and that’s why stocks reacted they did.
2951 2018-12-22 14:46:13 Silly, we are past the days of putting people in stocks + innocent until proven guilty
2952 2018-12-22 14:45:54 You’re just talking about Apple. I’m talking about stocks in general. Apple is the exception not the rule to the stock market. You can argue with me on this but the people you should be arguing with are the people who get laid off because their companies didn’t hit their earnings
2953 2018-12-22 14:45:28 Even though these past couple of days have been a disaster for the Trump admin, do not confuse falling stocks with the current state of the economy. Regardless, Trump appears to be unraveling. Total disaster in the oval office.
2954 2018-12-22 14:45:18 I a sure you think you are better qualified than the Board of Governors of the Fed because you have taken money out of a 10 year bull market in stocks and 30 year bull market in bonds.  Many taxicab drivers I know think the same thing about the Jets because they played sandlot.
2955 2018-12-22 14:44:38 U know  economics? what's ur success in stocks?
2956 2018-12-22 14:44:00 OMG, did Robert Wilson on @CNN just say that stocks fell 20% in 6 weeks in the 90s waiting for Ken Starrs impeachment report on Clinton. He implied cause and effect! OMG, dude, get a clue.
2957 2018-12-22 14:43:47 @smerconish stocks are plummeting because the Feds are raising the interest rate.  They are trying to make Trump look bad.
2958 2018-12-22 14:43:38 stocks rise by 1%.
2959 2018-12-22 14:43:35 No one country can make a difference by itself: fish do not respect borders. Any country acting unilaterally to husband fish stocks will have hurt its own fishing interests just to benefit others. This is a problem that can only be solved by European countries acting together.
2960 2018-12-22 14:43:29 hello! maw masternim replied na kung ilan stocks sa pb. we'll entertain orders for sure buyers kapag narelay na samin how much yung ems fee. we'll be collecting full payment for this batch and heads up lang guys, medj pricey talaga. ;_;
2961 2018-12-22 14:43:08 Maybe you should re-evaluate where you get your info. With Trump I don't really need to read or hear; I see it all the time. Who got us out of a bad recession & got the country back on it's feet after a republican recession? Obama! Stocks have been on the rise since 2010!
2962 2018-12-22 14:43:02 @ZyoriTV  we need a dota team stock market. Navi sucks , stocks go down, navi wins, stocks go down. Puppey replaces his players with dogs, up they go! Its your destiny! mr. midas would be proud!
2963 2018-12-22 14:42:58 Agree! Use our money for our good not a stupid wall. Besides I thought Mexico was to pay for it! So, let’s determine which of Trumps and congressional construction companies stocks will increase by giving them money. Where are the design plans outlining cost?
2964 2018-12-22 14:42:18 Maybe you should have shorted stocks. And bought gold.
2965 2018-12-22 14:40:11 @smerconish How many trump supporters have stocks & are benefitting from the stock market or being hurt? Am I wrong-isn't his base much on the poorer side? How many of these people have new jobs or higher paying jobs? How many of these people've been hurt by illegal immigrants?
2966 2018-12-22 14:40:00 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
2967 2018-12-22 14:39:27 Sec. Tillerson was correct Trump is a MORON. and is proving it. He and his Tariffs, wrong move, Stocks lowest in decades. Trump who overrides Sec.Mattis, found unfit to govern. Public blame Trump and You. and NONE of you in the Senate know what to do, Oh Dear. Pathetic.
2968 2018-12-22 14:37:24 2) Common Fishing Policy, From 2013,  there was a commitment for the first time to set quotas – based on hard scientific advice – that aim to go beyond stabilising fish stocks to achieving growth. how does destabilising that help business be better?
2969 2018-12-22 14:36:44 Nobody gets hurt on a rollercoaster except those that jump off in the middle of the ride.  Those “pennies on the dollar” stocks are on sale.  If you’re consistently funding your 401k and IRA, this is the “buy low” example in Investing 101.
2970 2018-12-22 14:35:27 #Liquidity is all that matters to stocks. Nothing else. We may see a final dip, but the #Fed reversing course would be what the market is looking for after a huge selloff. Stocks will absolutely explode higher to a new blow-off top prior to collapse imho.
2971 2018-12-22 14:35:27 Us stocks down. Conservative kicking his ass. 
This is bad news for Trump.
2972 2018-12-22 14:35:11 Just waiting for the market to crash so I can cash out on stocks

2974 2018-12-22 14:33:56 Wonder how much Trump Org has sunk into US steel stocks and futures?
2975 2018-12-22 14:32:38 There is no inflation, though. Stocks and energy have collapsed. What inflation?
2976 2018-12-22 14:32:22 cheer nyo suju nang yung ibang members magshare ng stocks kay siwon
2977 2018-12-22 14:32:11 Most people don't have stocks anyway
2978 2018-12-22 14:31:55 Yet it seems a lot of stocks are still too high in the skies...
2979 2018-12-22 14:31:33 Not how I’m reading it. I think the point is his audience is way more sophisticated than Cramer’s. They’re really two entirely different things. 

Plus I’m pretty sure my blind 18 year old cat is a better trader than Cramer, at least based on the stocks he recommends on his show.
2980 2018-12-22 14:31:28 Eeeexcellent! Hope your stocks can keep up with our demand, we're coming for you! :P

2982 2018-12-22 14:29:50 Wouldn’t let Obama do what? It was Obama who LEGALIZED Bump Stocks.
2983 2018-12-22 14:29:00 hi Evo bit of a daft question do you keep back stocks of old magazines? @evomagazine
2984 2018-12-22 14:28:05 Thank Trump for getting rid of bump stocks.
2985 2018-12-22 14:27:59 it looks like we may be in for a major fall by next H1 ,before post election rally. all darling stocks like rain graphite twins may breach yearly lows in next 3 months.
2986 2018-12-22 14:27:46 Ridicule, le Maroc, pays musulman, possède d'énorme stocks de sanglier et produit du porc et de l'alcool. Donc on peut déjà y consommer ses produits.

2987 2018-12-22 14:27:44 not mass production but delayed the purchase of the next batch. Event described is not new.

2989 2018-12-22 14:26:56 @realDonaldTrump   BAD MOVE.
Trump Administration Makes Bump Stocks Illegal
2990 2018-12-22 14:24:57 #showmeyourbags Thread for stocks held at year end during double-blowoff trumptop of 2018.
2018 taught me not to be a bagholder, but some things you just can't let go.
2991 2018-12-22 14:24:54 People  bitching about market being down, but t’is opportunity to buy stocks at low and just be patient. #thinklongterm
2992 2018-12-22 14:24:08 #Facebook, #Apple or #Google looked shaky this year — In recent weeks, as these companies have succumbed to concerns about the global economy, slowing profits or privacy concerns, they have led the decline in stocks.
2993 2018-12-22 14:24:00 Checks stocks for first time in two months....
2994 2018-12-22 14:23:57 As for cause, it's not hard to find one. For instance the Fed chair isn't allowed to own bank stocks. Powell owns a shitload of mutual funds and index funds.
2995 2018-12-22 14:22:45 Could this be a FANG induced correction rather than recession leading downturn ? 

Just like they influenced all stocks while going up, they are bringing all down with their correction. 

No matter what the theories are “constant selling force” is not slowing down.
2996 2018-12-22 14:22:21 YOUNG FOLKS. IF YOU GET SOME CHRISTMAS MONEY, OPEN A STOCK ACCOUNT AND BUY SOME STOCKS OR SHARES IN AN INDEX MUTUAL FUND WHILE THE MARKET IS DOWN RIGHT NOW.  THANK YOU FOR COMING TO MY TED TALK!

2999 2018-12-22 14:21:47 Someone who posts the Einsatzgruppen murdering a Jewish man to equate it to getting rid of bump stocks is a freaking idiot and completely ignorant or history and a mass genocide.  If you see the image popping up on Facebook or elsewhere just please ignore these dumb asses.
3000 2018-12-22 14:20:55 Here's the thing about stocks. They're entirely based on the confidence of those who own them. Once news comes out that you're going to lose money by holding onto your stock, everyone jumps ship at once.
This is not going to end well without yet another bailout.
3001 2018-12-22 14:20:34 Stocks downturn are only after the largest number of days of gain in it’s history, morons! Guess you forgot that fact #FakeNews
3002 2018-12-22 14:20:17 The US economy has slowed across the board, we’re in the midst of our second welfare payout to US farmers, and greedy billionaires used their gift from Trump to buy back stocks instead of passing it along to workers.
3003 2018-12-22 14:20:10 #stocks few folks I know have exited Twtr 4 a while. Can’t stand reading doom & gloom-also taken severe Mkt losses. My 401k/Mutial funds down 20% but this 2 shall pass like 87, 2000,2008-the mistake is tying 2 time Mkt in LT port. I have no margin-always opps if u don’t blow up
3004 2018-12-22 14:18:17 Maria, How are your stocks doing right now?

I hope you have LOTS of kids w/ jobs, this country will need all the taxes to pay off Trumps Deficit

Expand you viewing media, try @BBCWorld @MSNBC @CBSNews NOT JUST FOX, which btw has been bashing @realDonaldTrump
3005 2018-12-22 14:18:06 So what we all need to do is buy buy buy. If we can fund a wall on gofundme that hit millions in days, I think we need to buy stocks. If it goes low call or set up a stock market account and buy. Might sounds stupid but in the end we as The People won’t allow this to happen.
3006 2018-12-22 14:17:46 Yet another foolish comment from our resident lying conman! Longest run up of the stocks in the history of our country will inevitably cause a downturn, duh, Gomer! It will come back, hold on!
3007 2018-12-22 14:16:50 Investors right now got to keep calm and refrain from being aggressive. Markets are in no hurry to move up. Hold on to those stocks where you believe the prospects are going to improve. If 2018 was the year for investments, 2019 could be the year for wealth creation.
3008 2018-12-22 14:16:40 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to cure your insomnia
3009 2018-12-22 14:16:39 Christmas/new yrs around the corner ppl lock in profits for the year..it happens every year..just buy more (stocks) for better avg. price and wait to cash out
3010 2018-12-22 14:16:34 i wanna buy some stocks from sm then i remembered that i dont have money 

it’s frustrating that i cant do anything but give our boys emotional support
3011 2018-12-22 14:16:06 Trade war mainly against China should continue into next decade, the stocks may take about 12-18 months to recover. Fed cornered itself with the current statement, they won’t be able to act before February IMHO. More downside to come probably. We’ll see. Happy holidays...
3012 2018-12-22 14:15:56 Trump bans Bump Stocks? Liberal outrage

Trump pulls us out of Syria, which we shouldn’t have been there in the first place? Liberal outrage
3013 2018-12-22 14:13:47 Yourself at this point. Name things Trump has done to violate the constitution and has effected your life... I’ll wait. 

right not making bump stocks illegal, I’d say, is pretty unconstitutional but I bet you don’t care and celebrate it even. . . So continue
3014 2018-12-22 14:12:52 they are. they dialed back their hikes in 2019 and will continue to do so if economy weakens further. stocks are tanking, but unemployment is still low & inflation near 2%. stocks could easily rip higher if trade war ends next year.
3015 2018-12-22 14:12:48 The only way the debate is settled is if we see stocks at new highs one more time, what of QT then?
3016 2018-12-22 14:11:42 Vous avez des chiffres ? Pour créer une boîte il faut environ 150 K€/emploi (locaux, machines, stocks, etc.) Pour 20 personnes, il faut 3 millions, dont 1,5 M fonds propres et 1,5 M emprunts. Si ça foire on perd tout. On serait des spéculateurs ? Foutaises

3018 2018-12-22 14:11:18 You actually believe that? Have you seen the stocks he recommends on his show? For ex: didn’t he say Dominos is a tech stock??

If he is making money he does it by boosting companies enough to exit at a high price. And it’s not 24% for years - if it was he’d post his performance
3019 2018-12-22 14:09:42 You don’t have to be a chart genius to look at weekly candles on majority of stocks. Be ready for more ..,
3020 2018-12-22 14:09:04 Just like no one talks about the positive things Hitler did. As for CJ you can't blame Obama-he would have signed it but the GOP wouldn't pass it with him in the WH. I'll agree the bump stocks thing is good. But I'm more concerned about his illegitimacy than praising his policies
3021 2018-12-22 14:07:34 I think longer-term it's the dollar that will roll over and into a bear market. That'd be stock mkt positive. Might be stocks just in a scary correction. And oil is very cheap. Once inflation takes hold in 2019/2020 and ppl have less disposable income=mkt crash. Good for crypto2.
3022 2018-12-22 14:07:28 So, 47 members of #GOP & Pence were willing to spend an atrocious $5B on a wall that all experts say is not the best solution (& taxpayers were promised Mexico would pay for) knowing that social security & Medicaid would be gutted next – while deficit at highest & stocks lowest?
3023 2018-12-22 14:07:27 As popularity in the poker world goes.....so too does crypto HOWEVER, much of the new money has gone to cannabis stocks for now.
3024 2018-12-22 14:07:09 FAANG stocks been way over priced, still need to get lower
3025 2018-12-22 14:05:03 “Unless a miracle ‘Santa Claus rally’ emerges, this is going to be the worst year for U.S. stocks since 2008.”   2008 is remembered as the year my 401K got slaughtered.  2018 shaping up as the year my 401k got slaughtered, part 2
3026 2018-12-22 14:04:47 Lmaoo, Kylie made Snapchat what it is, one tweet abi post and she plummeted their stocks, her followers are very impressionable, whatever she does or starts will become a trend. Beyoncé is now beyond that time. If anybody can affect pop culture more, it’s Kylie at this point.
3027 2018-12-22 14:04:25 You must have forgotten that on National TV you told Schummer you would be proud of owning a shutdown! Even after there was a bipartisan agreement that you squashed after your right media criticised you! So you own the shutdown! Angry Grinch! How are the stocks doing? 
3028 2018-12-22 14:04:20 There were a lot of bump stocks lost in boating accidents this year.
3029 2018-12-22 14:04:16 Twitter is just a liberal community. It’s fun to come in here and poke them. The reasons twitter posted for the trump resign is the most stupidest thing I’ve seen. Dems spend more money on unneeded crap, Mattis retired after 4 decades! Stocks slumped do u worries of the shutdown!

3034 2018-12-22 14:02:20 Actually POTUS predicted if dems got elected stocks will dive. The people who elected Trump wanted a wall, that is a reason why he got elected

3.Russia laughs as Americas stocks plummet. 
4.Trumps hands Russia Syria and Middle East. 
5.Trump divides US with hate.

3045 2018-12-22 13:56:05 Stephen you are an author.  You write books.  Lots of good books !  Many movies too !  You invest your $$$ right ?
In stocks maybe ?  We're you pleased with 8 years of Obama Socialism where Stockmarket was stuck at 15,000 ?  And after a couple years of Trump it's now at 24,000 ?
3046 2018-12-22 13:55:03 The economy has peaked, and housing & stock market has peaked too.  I am afraid this downtrend will be painful, and people are not prepared for it. Nobody sees it coming because the "experts" are bullish! By all means, go buy some stocks!
3047 2018-12-22 13:54:34 Believe in your trading set up and analysis. Never fall in love with stocks, you do not know when it stops loving you.
3048 2018-12-22 13:52:14 I think there are a lot of hammered down valiue stocks for investors with 15-20 years timeframe. For traders, its a daily thing with the volatility that is unseen ever.
3049 2018-12-22 13:51:57 Lmfao, he turned this country to prosperity again?? Have you seen the news pal!? ALL GAINS IN THE MARKET made during his administration HAVE BEEN ERASED over the past three days of PLUMMETING STOCKS! This “ Great economy” has s nothing but a bubble. Bubbles burst, fool

3051 2018-12-22 13:51:42 I am sending it to people when they ask about the situation in France. Most comprehensive and in depth economic & political analysis I’ve read so far. Have you or anyone done an analysis of taxes on stocks vs flows in France & the impact on the yellow vest demographic?
3052 2018-12-22 13:50:18 trump discounted stocks!!!

WOOOOO!!!!
3053 2018-12-22 13:50:10 In a republican controlled govt & lack of willingness to do anything about it until the other day's announcement banning bump stocks... More mass shootings since he's been in office & marches held begging for change but instead the GOP clings to the NRA.
3054 2018-12-22 13:49:58 I can’t get into stocks because I have a deeply rooted fear of line graphs
3055 2018-12-22 13:48:25 The United States this week:

• Congress passes criminal justice reform bill

• White House announces withdrawal from Syria, Afghanistan to the shock of armed forces, allies, Kurds

• Shutdown overnight due to border wall funding contentions

• Worst stocks week in a decade

3058 2018-12-22 13:46:48 I couldn’t care less about bump stocks, don’t have one, don’t want one, but like you said, incremental. It’s like rolling a snowball down a hill, by the time it reaches the bottom, it’s the size of a house, capable of crushing the #2a to nothing
3059 2018-12-22 13:45:48 @CNBC    FAKE NEWS!!!!...... world stocks down twice as much to US stocks!  CNBC IS CLUELESS!!!
3060 2018-12-22 13:45:28 Virtually all of the fresh currency reserves created by the Fed to buy $4 trillion Treasury / MBS assets came right back to the Fed in the form of over night excess reserves.  Fed ZERO % rate policy was a subsidy to hedge funds and banks to borrow cheaply to buy stocks.
3061 2018-12-22 13:45:07 You gotta be kidding, lol.
Deplorables don’t own stocks.
They’re all about getting back jobs.
The stock market is generally the elite class
3062 2018-12-22 13:45:00 Me: This has been a tough week for stocks

You: This must have been a tough week

wow
3063 2018-12-22 13:44:34 Limited stocks!
High quality 
3064 2018-12-22 13:44:08 She’s right but I think it’s us who are shaking, next 2 years this country will go nowhere, it will be at a complete standstill, stocks have dropped 3000 points since midterms, what’s that say? Oh it must be Trumps fault. Or maybe the mkt is afraid if Democrats 
3065 2018-12-22 13:43:37 apple stocks rise by 69%.
3066 2018-12-22 13:43:19 Aaaaaand that's an impossible thing to do nowadays... Pure Stocks at my local dirt track cost minimum $10,000 to build a competitive car... Until they did away with them 3 years ago. Now the bottom class costs about $20k to run competitive. A guy had a Evernham NCWTS engine block
3067 2018-12-22 13:42:29 To #indvidual1 , 

the stock market is a barometer of his popularity 

The fed is there to keep stocks high

The fed is there to maintain his popularity.
3068 2018-12-22 13:41:50 Amazon is disrupting offline market but stocks like Dmart are trading at high pe
3069 2018-12-22 13:41:30 10% of crypto is not a scam for the record. Its gonna be bigger than the internet stocks of the 90's.
3070 2018-12-22 13:40:43 Not true at all. I like the prison reform bill. It’s been needed for decades and I’m glad Trump is making this happen. I’m concerned about the long game, but happy in the interim. I also like what he’s trying to do on bump stocks.
3071 2018-12-22 13:40:15 The one I get is How are your stocks doing? I'm like, which one from what day? Or, market took a hit, did you? No, I love it when the market tanks! ....and you get that look. Love it.
3072 2018-12-22 13:40:07 @WhiteHouse @GOP @DNC @TheJusticeDept @DHSgov @SecNielsen 2)IMO neocon Deep State-FakeTV- House drama next 2 years to crash Markets & blame @POTUS 2020 will be paid by US Workers+ is useless:Senate will vote all down+ WH veto.All to destroy US Stocks+make it cheap for "Shorters"
3073 2018-12-22 13:40:02 Gridlock is good when republican insiders are shorting stocks.
3074 2018-12-22 13:39:59 I have no use for bump stocks, I’m much more about accurate shooting so I wouldn’t own one but I am troubled that a right can be taken by our government with the stroke of a pen. Honest people should have no gun restrictions but a crime with a gun, real prison time.
3075 2018-12-22 13:39:45 Biggest laughing stocks
3076 2018-12-22 13:39:38 When disruption is fierce I feel one should not be in high p/e or rather expensive stocks, clearly larger pie to be lost incase things go wrong.

Try to bet small and win big in terms of value.
3077 2018-12-22 13:39:21 swear after this story mauubos stocks ng pilot v5 sa nbs #PTG31
3078 2018-12-22 13:39:21 Stocks and broths too. The liquid never boils, so they stay super clear.
3079 2018-12-22 13:38:45 Stocks are on pace for the worst December since the Great Recession...you were saying??
3080 2018-12-22 13:38:41 Still trying to understand..how does the Fed not buying treasuries make stocks illiquid?
3081 2018-12-22 13:37:21 Stock owners potential losses will be just minor problem if another great recession/US economic hard landing happens. Stocks/mutual funds investments are major source of income only for approx 15% of adult Americans, only 26% think stocks are the best long-term investment.
3082 2018-12-22 13:36:53 People likely bought the gifts in advance and so their stocks do what stocks do which is decline
3083 2018-12-22 13:36:44 Barrio jara...El único barrio que tiene dos stocks a menos de 500 mts..
3084 2018-12-22 13:33:36 History has proven that the fastest way to lose money in stocks is attempting to time the market.  It doesn't follow a "sign" wave.

3086 2018-12-22 13:31:49 Oh and btw the Emerson stock (EMR) is one of the only stocks that hasn't gone south in this mildly apocalyptic political climate.
3087 2018-12-22 13:31:44 They are shorting stocks and making money off the downturn. The only solution is the ballot box. Or less civil means of removal.
3088 2018-12-22 13:31:25 Passed prison reform, banned bump stocks, got us out of Syria which is a war Congress voted agains us getting involved in.
All those are things liberals should be happy with.
This is literally the first week of his presidency I've been happy with.

3090 2018-12-22 13:30:24 Ok, does not serve any purpose outside the military and then one exception hog hunting.  Let those two statements soak in a bit and you might see the contradiction.  Also, no military have bump stocks, they have the real McCoy.
3091 2018-12-22 13:30:07 this week 
Diamond up +57.89% while Access down -5.37% 
#stocks #banks $nge
3092 2018-12-22 13:30:00 U.S. stocks sank to a 17-month low to close out their worst week since August 2011, with every sector losing ground and heavy selling in technology shares driving the Nasdaq indexes into a bear market. Treasuries edged higher - Bloomberg
3093 2018-12-22 13:29:05 Ça dépend où ils habitent, des stocks disponibles et d'autres trucs. T'inquiètes pas, c'est normal si c'est long ^^
3094 2018-12-22 13:28:54 Drove money into stocks. And kept the politicians out of it.
3095 2018-12-22 13:28:52 The Tax Cut ! The top Companies used that money to buy back Stocks what dose that do to stocks. Plus China is slowing down so look out !!!!
3096 2018-12-22 13:28:37 I guess these ppl think svt bought plds stocks at this rate
3097 2018-12-22 13:27:26 I think this meltdown is great. Stocks are going on sale soon. I hope he does fire the SOB. Better sale. Get your cash ready. It’s an opportunity, not a crisis.
3098 2018-12-22 13:27:06 To my fellow Red friends who were hosting on how the economy is doing historically high closings for the past 2 years EVEN THOUGH that is just a fraction of the health of our economy.......what's your thinking on yesterday's historicly WORST CLOSING in stocks in 10 years?
3099 2018-12-22 13:25:18 I remember trump boasting about the performance of the US stocks at the beginning of his term. Now the us stocks are at a historical low level.

3100 2018-12-22 13:24:26 Et bah, je verrais si les stocks se remplissent d'ici là nouvelle année (je n'avais pas vu aussi les boutiques physiques sur le site), sinon j'enverrai un petit message pour tenter en direct !
Merci 
3101 2018-12-22 13:24:15 Bastards. Put them into stocks and leave them at Gatwick departures.
3102 2018-12-22 13:23:32 F both trump and Mitch.  Put them both in public stocks on the senate floor with ball gags and F them this whole holiday season
3103 2018-12-22 13:22:52 Had I not changed funds, I’d have lost more like $17k. Almost every dollar my employer contributed this year was wiped out. Friday, I transferred the whole balance + future contributions out of stocks & into a fund that is all bonds & Treasuries. Little growth, but safety. 2/2
3104 2018-12-22 13:21:59 Put them in stocks outside Gatwick.
3105 2018-12-22 13:21:38 He needs a fall guy for the stocks thanking. IMO
3106 2018-12-22 13:21:32 Perso je dis me « perdre » car je ne joue plus que en 1v1 3 stocks. Faudrait que je me refasse quelques parties à plusieurs et ça revient. Le style de combat et le personnage serait différent aussi ^^ #CombatDur
3107 2018-12-22 13:21:08 I agree. Pence is a right wing extremist, however, with the neq incoming house in January he isn't going to be able to do anything crazy as far as laws go. The devastation would be around trade and stocks, something he knows nothing about.
3108 2018-12-22 13:21:01 As if brick & mortar retail weren’t suffering enough. They will rely on low margin/high volume to save Q4, look for sales on pace but negative ebitda when they report earnings in a few months. DIY store stocks (Lowe’s/H Depot) may be a good buy on the dip.
3109 2018-12-22 13:20:05 Surely mom and pop are not trading and weathered 2008/9 too no? Hmm I do remember a retail rush to stocks in Jan 2018 sadly
3110 2018-12-22 13:19:47 Banning bump stocks IS A BIG DEAL. Next it will be spare parts, then magazines. Ect...
3111 2018-12-22 13:18:59 Agree. Every "friend" of Trump is profiting from his tweets that either pop or drop the market. I'd sure like to see an analysis of trades right before his tweets.

Some magats are saying: Good, stocks will be low enough that we can buy & profit with Trump. Totally uneducated.
3112 2018-12-22 13:18:58 Omg you have just handed 420k employees a Christmas they will cherish. How dare you beat ur chest and acclaim ur proud to shutdown government. Also thank you for plummeting stocks into a BEAR market not seen since '08. Is this ur vision of MEGA?
3113 2018-12-22 13:18:53 With the Great Tax Cut, the Top Companies used that money to buy back stock. How did that affect stocks ?
3114 2018-12-22 13:18:47 You’re right Ty. In fairness Justin said “meeting the criteria” which is true, but it will be 1460 stocks in the 2 test groups and the remainder as the control stocks. Still a big # for a pilot in my view but thankfully less than 1/2 the 3000 test stocks originally proposed.
3115 2018-12-22 13:18:25 He’s a genius... a stable one ... who probably has lots of money invested in steel stocks
3116 2018-12-22 13:18:21 2.) companies like Facebook Amazon Apple Netflix Google (FAANG)... fiat or debt based currencies like the $ are dead and the inflation that everyone says they are scared of has already been happening for years but is “hidden” in the overpriced stocks like the ones mentioned
3117 2018-12-22 13:18:14 In February, I transferred my balance into a fund lighter on stocks, cuurrnt contributions continued to go into the growth fund. Did that because I figured the momentum of the Obama economy would slow as Taxscam effects kicked in. Since October 1st I’ve lost $7k. 1/x
3118 2018-12-22 13:18:01 Forget the darn wall. Focus on the collapsing economy! Stocks had worst  week since 2011! S&P down 7.1% in ONE WEEK! @larry_kudlow @stevenmnuchin1 @SpeakerRyan @senatemajldr
3119 2018-12-22 13:16:10 Why not put it in an IRA or your own bank CDs. Be fortunate you have a retirement fund. Lots of small business owners don't because they have employees. Merry Christmas. Hope your funds go back up stocks are a gamble
3120 2018-12-22 13:16:08 @JulietteJDI Reading thru Twitter . It is amazing all the people enjoying... Markets getting crushed aka mom and pops. Most of them tho were wrong for the last 40% of stocks and oils move. That bad of trading would have broken me
3121 2018-12-22 13:16:04 Worst December in stocks since Great Depression.
3122 2018-12-22 13:16:02 I Like the beard Ted.  The RINOs have wasted two years during which they could have accomplished great things for America (not you).  Meanwhile the super-rich are using Wall Street to manipulate the market to rob us blind in our 401Ks--then they will scoop up cheap stocks.
3123 2018-12-22 13:15:48 Even if you don’t own stocks directly, your quality of life is impacted by the market
3124 2018-12-22 13:15:05 This means a sale on stocks!
3125 2018-12-22 13:15:00 Save R10.00 when you buy Cosmos Briquettes  from Pick n Pay. Prices valid until 26 December 2018 or while stocks last! #ShopAJP #PicknPay #Specials
3126 2018-12-22 13:14:42 Due to Stocks value of their companies.
3127 2018-12-22 13:14:12 @cspanwj Where do investors put their money when they don't invest it in stocks.
3128 2018-12-22 13:13:46 A ladder and an old mattress.   Toss the mattress over the spikes to protect oneself while sliding over!

Or simply cut a few spikes w/an acetylene torch+step on through!

Does Trump have some secret steel stocks? Why is he trying for a stupid upgrade to an iron curtain?
3129 2018-12-22 13:13:09 Sale now on, up to 75% off while stocks last
3130 2018-12-22 13:13:01 Stocks value of their companies.
3131 2018-12-22 13:10:27 Do you own stocks in a wall company? Seriously, you blab so much about this stupid idea you must want to profit from it some how.
3132 2018-12-22 13:10:08 And they can just buy more stock and low prices.  There’s money to be made when stocks are low or high.  This downturn really just hurts average Americans with savings in 401ks and IRAs
3133 2018-12-22 13:09:08 Thats why diversification matters, some real state, some bonds, some forestry, some cash, stocks with divy .. and stay invested ...
3134 2018-12-22 13:08:39 Omlouvám se, nespojil jsem si ten tweet s tou Trumpovou reakcí na Powella. V tomto máte zcela jistě pravdu.
3135 2018-12-22 13:08:15 My guess on initial reaction if Orange Cheeto firing Powell: Stocks up, massive curve steepening, dollar crashes.
3136 2018-12-22 13:07:35 I’m old enough to remember the website ragingbull ! #stocks #markets #thebubble
3137 2018-12-22 13:07:06 More than half of Americans do not own stocks in any form. If you are worried about fluctuations in the stock market then put your money in the bank, CDs, treasuries. Stock market performance is not guaranteed. It's risky.
3138 2018-12-22 13:06:04 Your future pensions are being held in the market, employee share plan, in addition to 50% of America that have their own mutual funds/stocks. Everyone is affected
3139 2018-12-22 13:05:48 When SM stocks EXO's albums again just then they can sell other people albums
3140 2018-12-22 13:05:07 To be a successful investor, you need to make only a few good decisions and for that you need to actively look for reasons not to buy a company. Knowing what to avoid; being wise is a far superior approach to being smart - trying to get in and out of stocks.
3141 2018-12-22 13:04:59 What's another 5 billion on top of huge GOP deficits, you say?  Trump promised Mexico would pay for a wall.  Trump promised tax cuts would generate more revenue for gov.  Debt soaring, stocks falling, still no "best ever" health care, trade falling.  Now the  #Trumpshutdown
3142 2018-12-22 13:04:19 We don't disclose the number of stocks we have. Sorry!
3143 2018-12-22 13:03:16 Remember when everyone was bragging about the stock market being so great because of Trump? Well it's been in the shitter for a while, and now I'm worried about how I'm going to pay for college in the future because I have all of my college funds in stocks!
3144 2018-12-22 13:03:02 So my stocks are tanking and the soc sec and Medicare taxes from my paycheck have gotten higher. Thanks @realDonaldTrump really appreciate all that winning! POS!!!
3145 2018-12-22 13:02:15 They have been carried out by stretchers.  Kinda reminded of late '08 in terms of stocks rout but that was scary time because of the unknown banking situation in the US at that time.
3146 2018-12-22 13:01:39 The ppl who do need one are those who dont have locked-in agent contracts and liquidity stocks going back forever. I would exclude WU, MG and a couple others from that"gotta do it" list. One can of course debate about Ripple but thats a secondary issue.
3147 2018-12-22 13:01:27 No one gives a fuck about bump stocks. 99.99% of gun enthusiasts had never heard of them until recently.
3148 2018-12-22 13:01:18 And ELF case was just amazing, non-comparable to this, they even bought the stocks 
3149 2018-12-22 12:59:23 Stocks drop on the just and the unjust alike.
3150 2018-12-22 12:56:53 Is that the same bill you used to cover up the banning of bump stocks
3151 2018-12-22 12:56:43 "Hey man fight me for real this time! Use your best character."
*picks jigglypuff*
"Nah man. I mean a real character."
*wins with 3 stocks*
3152 2018-12-22 12:56:17 A common question, but it has never been clear why ETF investors are expected to be more prone to panic-selling than those holding mutual funds or individual stocks. Besides, ETFs have endured bear markets before. Remember 2008-09?
3153 2018-12-22 12:54:16 @csmoneytrade Please increase the navaja knife crimson web(MW) skin stocks. I cannot trade because of this overstock problem for 10 days and I wanted your help for this problem many times before but you didn't. Find a solution.
3154 2018-12-22 12:53:38 The Feds raising the interest rate caused the stocks to go down. The President had nothing to do with that. Didnt hear anyone praising the President when the stock market shot up.
3155 2018-12-22 12:53:21 Bring back the stocks; I am sure there will be many willing volunteers to pelt them with tomatoes. Merry Christmas
3156 2018-12-22 12:52:41 Ugh nothing I hate more than the week leading up to Christmas. Mum always  stocks the fridge and cupboards full of class food but as soon as anyone enters the kitchen...  “no that’s for Christmas”. Aye fuck off Amber that’s fine, I’ll just starve 
3157 2018-12-22 12:52:17 Just as I run out of my favourite @valeriecafe mince pies, I get an email offering me 50% off! Hot footed it to the shops and have replenished my stocks for £3 something. Tis a Christmas miracle 
3158 2018-12-22 12:51:36 Wrong move. Buy all the foreign stocks. The dollar will fall so you'll need foreign currencies and stocks through the next year or two.
3159 2018-12-22 12:51:01 Waooo and U see our stocks on exchanges flying
3160 2018-12-22 12:50:38 Hey @POTUS @realDonaldTrump So you banned bump stocks....I can still do the same thing with a rubber band..... #DefendThe2nd #TruePatriots #ThreePercenter
3161 2018-12-22 12:50:15 Well we got that in financial assets.  They shoulda bought stocks and bunds.
3162 2018-12-22 12:49:14 Economy not a mixed bag. Fed has risen rates 8 times in 2 yrs under Trump because the economy is so strong. Fed raised rates ONCE in 8 years under Obama because economy was so weak. U also don’t mention that cuts put more money in people’s pocket. Rate hikes hurting stocks..dope
3163 2018-12-22 12:47:07 The thing is the japan website says it’s while stocks last! So it will definitely run out later...
3164 2018-12-22 12:46:11 STOCKS GO UP STOCKS GO DOWN DID YOU STAY AT A HOLIDAY INN EXPRESS LAST NIGHT LOL

3166 2018-12-22 12:45:12 ...the Nasdaq confirming it is in a BEAR MARKET,, as concerns of slowing economic growth led investors to flee stocks in high-valuation sectors such as technology and communication services.(Reuters, 12/21.)
3167 2018-12-22 12:44:24 Crypto will be green stocks Will be red
3168 2018-12-22 12:41:48 Everywhere I read now that apple will make a run. I’m not that familiar with stockmarkets, is news regarding stocks correct sometimes or is it like those brian kelly calls ?
3169 2018-12-22 12:41:24 Use the stocks, Luke!
3170 2018-12-22 12:41:16 LOL You must have memory lost. Surely you haven't forgotten about how high it's  been for a long time and doing better in awhile! I sure have profited from my stocks big time since POTUS Trump has been in office! I took a lost while Obummer was in office like so many did to.
3171 2018-12-22 12:40:59 Then all tech stocks too will retrace 80%. So $AMZN should be at 500 in a year
3172 2018-12-22 12:40:58 40-50% own no stocks at all.
3173 2018-12-22 12:40:50 My last grumble. 

One of the requests I’ve had is for a scent so seemingly obscure that not a single apothecary in Oxfordshire stocks it.

Doubtless should I find it, it will be 600 guineas an ounce.
3174 2018-12-22 12:40:09 Remember: The #stocks which are currently not on new lows showing strengths. They are not a short opportunity. Wait for a pullback/consolidation in the weak stocks to short them.
3175 2018-12-22 12:40:08 I gotta say, the weed stocks held fairly strong against this downward slope the market is heading in. Yesterday was the first day where they really got smacked.
3176 2018-12-22 12:40:02 Going after law abiding citizens is not the answer. It's the criminals and illegal guns on the streets that's the main problem. Bump stocks dont kill. People do. And in reality bump stocks actually make it harder to shoot straight. So in the end would most likely save lives.
3177 2018-12-22 12:38:52 I didn’t think the military needed bump stocks. Don’t they have select fire?
3178 2018-12-22 12:38:12 ... More importantly they said they planned on only raising rates 2 times next year instead on 3, and stocks are cheap and getting cheaper. We need more logic, critical thinking, and less emotional reactions to reap the rewards or current economic situation has to offer.
3179 2018-12-22 12:37:54 As a founder or CEO of any company, 
if you are celebrating fundraising by liquidating your stocks, 

Are you really making justice to your dream and business as well?
3180 2018-12-22 12:37:06 SpaceX's stocks are private. Not cool Elon.
3181 2018-12-22 12:35:51 I think they’re referring to traditional stocks since everything is pointing to a collapse of the stock market 
3182 2018-12-22 12:35:27 I wonder how many of Trump’s base actually own stocks, though?
3183 2018-12-22 12:35:24 I don't offer portfolio selection. My service gives buy/sell signals for all liquid US stocks. That's not something that can be shared on wikifolio.
3184 2018-12-22 12:33:30 Stocks in free fall, a President under investigation, Real leaders resigning, others being indicted, a retreat from a war zone, a Govt on the verge of shutdown...in other words, a monumental cock-up!

You aren't serious, are you? Where is the £19.99 frozen Goose for Christmas you advertised to be in stores from 19th December 2018? Stop bullshitting & tell us where the stocks are! All your stores do not have it. Your staff haven't got a clue if you ever supplied one!
3187 2018-12-22 12:30:40 So I guess you had a good year with your China shorts? Congrats! Your commentary on China stocks convinced me that my valuation framework was too simplistic and contributed to saving me from some losses this year.
3188 2018-12-22 12:30:28 dying so bad there's no way hes mushing stocks now
3189 2018-12-22 12:29:52 Stocks and bonds
3190 2018-12-22 12:29:26 No they didnt. Geithner sold off what stocks the government bought of GM at a $22 billion dollar loss to the American taxpayers to keep GM alive. You really need to do your homework
3191 2018-12-22 12:29:15 3/ confidence, soend less and growth is affected. Many companies are funded by stocks and when their is volatility it affects their ability to raise capital to fund their business goals. Also, Bitcoin and crypto in general are startup concepts that are not mature. Yes...
3192 2018-12-22 12:27:52 TRUMP’S WEEK OF UNFITNESS: Worst Dec for STOCKS  since Great Depression; SHUTDOWN of govt by Trump to appease Fox News; Trump GIFTS SyriA to ISIS, RUSSIA & IRAN after being bullied by Turkey’s pres to leave Syria;more OBSTRUCTION when Trump bullied AG over Cohen handling by SDNY.
3193 2018-12-22 12:27:27 Much of the current effect in the volatility are really 3 things. Over leverage oil stocks, floundering tech stocks, and the Fed unpredictability under current leadership. The 8 years of zero to near zero interest from 2009 to 2017 was an easy target for predictabilty
3194 2018-12-22 12:27:07 Here comes the Trump Slump:
+ Worst week in stocks since financial crisis of 2008
+ Worst December since the Great Depression
+ Tariff Man’s policies hurting industry and global trade
+ Government shutdown
3195 2018-12-22 12:26:52 Interest rates went up on Wednesday, stocks plummet...worst since the Depression...do you hear the American people now???
3196 2018-12-22 12:26:35 When @realDonaldTrump tweets he is going to shut down the government. Stocks crash. Investors don’t like instability. #NYSE #StockMarket #feder #ImpeachTrumpNow #NYSE #NASDAQ at @realDonaldTrump is causing it.
3197 2018-12-22 12:26:07 Does anyone think he is deliberately making the stocks tank so he and his family can buy in at the lowest point and then he will say something to make them climb again. Ingenious, he could make billions more.
3198 2018-12-22 12:26:00 Well, it’s not over yet. But, I expect this to remain as a short cyclical bear where only select names correct their excesses. I expect more downside in Q1, but some stocks may be more resilient than others...
3199 2018-12-22 12:25:43 2/ sell them for money but you cannot buy other things with them like widely accepted currencies. Volatility in the stock markets directly affects world economies for several reasons. People’s wealth is invested in stocks so when prices deop people have less...
3200 2018-12-22 12:25:42 DOW foolish traders and short term investors are without any reason or logic dumping stocks. Stay in equanimity and continue to invest but wisely.

It has high transaction costs and volatile price movements which make it undesirable. Stocks are not currency. You can gift them, trade them...

They already live in underemployed low wage Red states. Maybe the college educated suburbanites in his base get it.

3235 2018-12-22 11:54:21 S&P 500 and Dow Jones have fallen 17.5% &16.3% from their respective highs. After a month of heavy losses, stocks are on track for their worst year since 2008 & @realDonaldTrump silence is deafening
3236 2018-12-22 11:52:14 Assessing nervousness and investor anxiety with stocks dropping as they are. Some amazing buy opportunities-will your brain let you?
3237 2018-12-22 11:51:02 Just checking on some stocks that stopped me out previously. Sure glad I sold them.
3238 2018-12-22 11:49:00 The negativity narrative by the institutions is working to deter people from investing into crypto. They’d rather them invest in institutional stocks and shares to keep the bonus merry go round running. Early adopters of crypto will reap the benefits. Big things coming for 2019

3240 2018-12-22 11:48:37 Right sure! Republicans fought tooth and nail to reduce the regulations on banks.

Thereby setting everyone up again for the fleece.

3244 2018-12-22 11:46:07 But I think what would “stop” that is the logic of the market itself - prices are set at an equilibrium where people will buy and sell, if stocks go up, more people sell, if they go down, more people buy.

3250 2018-12-22 11:43:43 At the core of Warren Buffett's investment philosophy is value investing. 

This actually means to identify high quality companies whose stocks are trading at a lower price than should be.
3251 2018-12-22 11:41:52 Would like to add 2 points.

1. Huge domestic investor fund flow because of demonetisation has reduced undue importance of foreign investors.

2. Investment flows have two components. (i) investment into stocks (FII). (ii) direct (FDI). I believe, FDI has gone up.

One that has me thinking - look for new highs (in relation to picking the next wave). What if Gov policy has doomed next wave to non-US stocks - unlikely, but...
3260 2018-12-22 11:34:51 But you cannot argue with evidence: index funds have grown about six times faster than those achieved by active funds managers who select stocks to buy.
3261 2018-12-22 11:34:08 Currently only 150 stocks out of the 500 in the $SPX are up over the last 12 months.

3266 2018-12-22 11:31:53 Although i voted to remain, in ref ,I'm not sure i want to remain anymore. In the EU we have rules to protect fish stocks. Rules to smooth the way for business. Yet countries within the EU can treat their people however they want. This UK govt is harming and killing citizens.
3267 2018-12-22 11:31:40 i usually prefer to buy around the second low with positive divergence with the index....higher low for the stocks above 200 moving average  but a lower low for the sp500 index...
3268 2018-12-22 11:30:20 You probably wanna stick stocks and bonds... Spot FX would be the best choice given the offer stated

3296 2018-12-22 11:02:53 If quant easing resulted in asset prices going up in search of returns, you must expect a quant “tightening” of sorts to reverse that. I would tread with caution on stocks for 2019 - especially most careful with the volatile tech stocks.

3311 2018-12-22 10:49:41 what are you top uranium stocks?
3312 2018-12-22 10:47:50 So a small percentage of the population. I’m not really sure why owning stocks is proof of equality anyway.
3313 2018-12-22 10:43:36 apple stocks rise by 10%.
3314 2018-12-22 10:43:35 Repeal Hughes, Open the Registry, and bump stocks will become irrelavent.
3315 2018-12-22 10:43:12 Interesting alternative SD modelling approach based on 'principles of stocks, flows, and real-world data applied to a whole economy'. But a bit concerned about nuclear still in the picture as a solution!?!?
3316 2018-12-22 10:42:46 The last week - month has been rough on stocks and bonds. By next July it should be back on the upward track it was on in October
3317 2018-12-22 10:42:19 No problems with the low rates, Draghi said.  People should just invest in stocks, instead of putting the money in the bank. How is that advice working out? Just as good at the Euro I would say.
3318 2018-12-22 10:40:15 "When bear markets begin, nobody realizes it’s a bear market. A bear market is defined as a 20% decline. So, until stocks hit that level, it’s not a bear. The pundits tell you to buy the dip." - @PeterSchiff #dow #recession

3320 2018-12-22 10:39:53 Bump stocks do not meet the def of a Machine gun, this ban opens a huge door to ban everything. The hughes amendment is responsible for stupid bump stocks anyway, and never should have passed. It needs repealed and the registry opened.
3321 2018-12-22 10:39:43 really pathetic the way in which entire segments have been taken down , more than the stocks, the employment implications in all these cos are horrendous.
3322 2018-12-22 10:39:05 I just hope my petrol station stocks them! 
3323 2018-12-22 10:38:33 SDing after losing two stocks is such babyish behavior, did you not learn better sportsmanship at your Junior baseball league.
3324 2018-12-22 10:36:47 Hillary and her thugs have huge investments, stocks related to Syria. They need war to expand  their fortunes on behalf of many many innocent people.
3325 2018-12-22 10:36:29 US stocks suffered one of the worst weekly falls in a decade as trade tensions with China, interest rate rises and a possible government shutdown rattled markets

3329 2018-12-22 10:34:41 Because of the Hughes Amendment you can't transfer any machine gun after may of 86. NRA promised Reagan they would take Hughes to court and welched, just like Bump stocks. The best thing that could come out of this is a repeal of Hughes and open the registry.#Repealthehughesamend
3330 2018-12-22 10:34:34 No, stocks are down because of uncertainty about the China/US trade dispute, the government shutdown, and how unpredictable he administration is.
3331 2018-12-22 10:34:03 Does anywhere know where I can short stocks on leverage - ideally somewhere without very aggressive stop hunts like IG
3332 2018-12-22 10:34:01 250 - 220 - 57 = -27. Use of stocks, imports or statistical discrepancy. I would guess it's the third case. It's Russia after all.
3333 2018-12-22 10:33:26 explorers/not fully funded/requiring cash, will be the least popular stocks for PIs going forward. 

also to be selective on sector as oil is still at the bottom, copper still downwards, while gold and palladium are expected to rise in 2019.

3364 2018-12-22 09:55:31 The year started well with stocks at near life time highs but we are at near more than a year lows since and heading into a recession. Brace yourself for 2019 and I hope it turns out better than what is expected.
3365 2018-12-22 09:54:08 How about 20 years in the stocks by the end of the runway - turn them into something useful - bird scarers! 
3366 2018-12-22 09:54:03 I think I'm onto something interesting with this stamina battle/final smash meter ruleset.

3367 2018-12-22 09:51:11 There’s a huge diff between raising a little bit with keep raising and concurrently removing billions of liquidity from the markets every month.

3385 2018-12-22 09:37:29 Only real edge left. Algos, sentiment, etfs and short timeframes tend to make stocks overshoot both to the upside and to the downside. Take advantage of that. Timing is the problem though

3392 2018-12-22 09:31:41 @BBCCountryfile when will you cover the plight of fresh water fish stocks in the UK. The combined threat of pollution, predation and poaching is emptying our fresh waters of fish. @AnglingTrust .
3393 2018-12-22 09:30:45 A few investing lessons from 2018:

1. Avoid something like Bitcoin
2. Don't believe in rumors
3. Never expect small & mid-caps to always perform like 2017
4. Even if the fundamentals are good, quality stocks may not perform as expected
5. Don't let petty issues affect your goals
3394 2018-12-22 09:29:51 Harish, nice concept but NSE 200 looks too homogeneous and narrow for the analysis , I have a feeling if you do the same analysis for 2000 stocks it may be a different picture.

3396 2018-12-22 09:28:02 I’ll second that  year after year GHF has the ability to produce those fantastic stocks. 
3397 2018-12-22 09:26:31 I think people really need to reconsider their approach. It might be better to fight & speak up to get the ban removed than the alternative to not vote for Trump. If the Dems get control before there are major changes there may not be guns to put bump stocks on.
3398 2018-12-22 09:25:28 You care nothing of our hardworking citizens. Stocks are tanking.

3400 2018-12-22 09:23:51 @CNN @potus Trump bans bump-stocks and you liberals sit on your arse  and hardly mention it. If Obama had done it you'd be praising him to the high heavens. You people are so funny in your hate for Trump, who has done so many good things. It's funny watching you people. 
3401 2018-12-22 09:23:41 Kindly see my retweet of Mr Peter Brandt tweet of a sub 19500 ( 17971 exzct target ) target of Dow by end 2019, what do you expect energy stocks to do ,  with TW bringing down China also now ?

3403 2018-12-22 09:22:29 I remember looking like a fool in late 2008 buying Metso, KONE, Cargotec, Nordea,Sampo etc when everybody was panicking. Little bit like buying certain oilfield service stocks today. I may be wrong though
3404 2018-12-22 09:21:54 I dunno if you were watching my tweets earlier. For a few months, I have been continuously tweeting on weakness in Energy stocks. 
The problem is CRB Index charts are still looking v weak, bottoms are quite far off.

3405 2018-12-22 09:21:25 Bastard! My Canadian weed stocks are suffering!  The entire stock market is on a free falling trajectory to catastrophe! When will the winning start bc all I'm seeing is alot of "I told you so, this man is a wrecking ball with the IQ of a pebble"
3406 2018-12-22 09:20:49 Why don’t, instead, we look at how many citizens are employed by these companies.  Who’s 401Ks are affected. Their stocks dropped with Tarriffs, not stopping the war.

3416 2018-12-22 09:15:35 The reason it is easier to go trade stocks compared to business is because no one can see your transaction (especially if it fails).

Because people will criticize you if you fail.
They'll try to find your faults not how you can be better.
What a place we have.
3417 2018-12-22 09:14:50 Shutdown, stocks crashing, generals resigning...man. I'm so tired of all of this winning.

3418 2018-12-22 09:14:46 Supposed they used it for stock buy-backs, that only tells me you are not willing to do second order analysis because they must buy stocks from investors. These investors will obviously reinvest the proceeds or consume them. You have a problem with that?

3433 2018-12-22 09:04:59 Recalling Oct 2008, remember between Oct and Dec 2008 many stocks bottomed, some didn’t even double bottom or reach new lows in Mar 2009. Always be careful selling when you are going to take a big loss.
3434 2018-12-22 09:04:30 Stocks did really well. The rest of the country took a long time to recover.

3440 2018-12-22 08:56:59 @H8_2_W8 @neoneo I don’t even see the point of buying actual stocks instead of options
3441 2018-12-22 08:56:32 The economy is going to get washed. We can't print our way out of what's coming a second time. The future is uncertain. Best advice is to buy physical gold...sell your stocks now. Buy back in some years time.
3442 2018-12-22 08:55:56 When Insurance companies certify that there are stocks,and bills were issued under RBI's BMS for rediscounting, the fraud committed squarely will lie on NSEL. Noone goes to a godown and expect to be shown third party goods
3443 2018-12-22 08:55:19 With a strong economy his only ally plummeting stocks will see his corporate 'friends' pulling the rug He will go one way or another
3444 2018-12-22 08:54:27 When NSEL marketed it paired contracts were under consideration by FOMC.hence were not illegal. Brokers of mine even went to Nellore and Chittoor to verify Godowns&Stocks and returned satisfied before advising us.
They even showed us Insurance certificates. What does that mean?
3445 2018-12-22 08:54:25 I have to say I am a but gutted.  Never been a permabear but was able to put more money into stocks this year and no sooner did I turns  profit than I am staring at big losses.

3465 2018-12-22 08:39:01 While the universe of stocks these days has seemingly endless opportunities for you to load up on cheap value stocks, beware of a massive bear trap. We're 10 yrs into the longest bull run since Coolidge and Hoover, but we're also witnessing a decline the worst since 1931.

3470 2018-12-22 08:33:38 Yes, most coins are scams and shell games.  That's true of penny stocks too.   Buyer beware.  Bitcoin, though, is not a penny stock anymore and cannot be held to the same analysis.   And the existence of penny stocks does not cast the entire market into doubt.

3479 2018-12-22 08:19:02 In a bear market some stocks are going to fall by more 75%. That stock you're currently fancying which has halved might be one of them - in which case it will more than halve again from here. Risk management remains as important as ever.

3481 2018-12-22 08:15:35 I expect a crash across the board in 2019. European stocks look especially vulnerable though. Little tools left for the ECB to support the markets.
3482 2018-12-22 08:15:30 Certainly possible but this is not a typical time. I won't put money in while funds active/passive are likely disentegrsting, inv since 09 fully invested &  margined up, contagions likely just spreading and most inv who never believed stocks would fall are shell shocked.

3526 2018-12-22 07:39:59 The issue is the illegal way they banned the bump stock could be used to ban other features eliminating the platform all together.  This is why a SCOTUS ruling is needed to stop that in it's tracks.  I doubt there are really that many bump stocks out there, they make AR no good.

If you have a sale on the 22nd of December, it's not a 'Boxing Day Sale' at all, is it? It's a desperately trying to flog off your over-stocks sale, at least be honest

3583 2018-12-22 06:39:07 @realDonaldTrump my father graduated high school and went to college at NMSU. My parents worked their asses off and they were very well off. So much so they invested all their savings in 401k stocks and savings bonds which they are now retired and living off.
3584 2018-12-22 06:38:52 It's true he is right him and all his colleagues have good stocks for themselves not public fuel

3592 2018-12-22 06:31:36 If true this is bad. It would imply that Grizzle shorted pot stocks in early 2018, then asked big 3 producers to get paid for writing bullish articles instead? BettingBruiser and Chris Parry are doing the same

3610 2018-12-22 06:15:11 Yeah I am looking forward to the deadline. There will be a report that maybe 3 of the estimated half million bump stocks out there have been turned in. That will get a lot of publicity and the reaction of the antigunners will entertaining

3626 2018-12-22 06:03:37 Many may have bought different 100 PE stocks in the past, only few had exponential growth. In hindsight, the winners will appear visionary. If, for arguments sake, 90% of 100 PE stocks gave poor returns, isn't it prudent to avoid such 100 PE stocks?

3636 2018-12-22 05:57:26 They have no idea. You’d could see stocks down another 25%. EASY.
3637 2018-12-22 05:56:44 Have observed this phenomenon globally over last ten years. When stock markets plunge to depths, a  vast majority of the investors have zero money in hand to invest in the stocks they really like 
3638 2018-12-22 05:56:17 stocks don't bottom on Fridays?
3639 2018-12-22 05:56:08 So pensions, 401ks, retirement funds arent affected by this? Economy is tied to stocks
3640 2018-12-22 05:55:39 They make bump stocks for handguns?
3641 2018-12-22 05:55:14 Raising the interest rate by 0.25% doesn't cause stocks to plummet.
A very weak Christmas season and lower gas prices are more to blame.
3642 2018-12-22 05:55:12 US stocks suffer amid D.C. tumult ; Dow has worst week in a decade.
3643 2018-12-22 05:53:25 #TrumpResign Investors fear a recession is coming, and barring huge gains during the upcoming holiday period, when trading is usually quiet, this will be the worst December for stocks since the 1930s.

3646 2018-12-22 05:51:34 problem is liquidity will dry up totally, CRB Index goes down means mining cos will not do well for one or two quarters( not more ) and people may sell stocks at distress prices to raise cash what with Real Estate also down
3647 2018-12-22 05:50:59 Listen Donnie, shut up. No one wants a border wall. Anyone who feels safe with you in office is delusional. Stocks are in a slump, you have no understandingly what you’re doing in Syria and Afghanistan. You don’t even have a grasp on what ISIS is! #TrumpResign
3648 2018-12-22 05:50:15 Isn't this survivorship and confirmation bias? There will be far far far more instances of people losing money after buying 100 PE stocks. Buying HDFC at 100 PE appears smart and visionary only in hindsight.
3649 2018-12-22 05:49:58 So you mean you stopped criminals from having bump stocks to shoot faster. I'm so glad criminals fallow laws. You did a great job... How did your schools gun free zone workout again?

3658 2018-12-22 05:44:19 I answered YES bc I've made what I consider a lot of money in my 401K since, President Trump has been in office compared to the thousands I lost when obama was president. Bf I lost it all I took it out of stocks and put it in bonds so I'd have something to build on waiting 4 DJT

Trump isnt going anywhere for 6 more years.

The market always recovers.

17 years in Afghan is enough.

Syria is a waste of time.

3664 2018-12-22 05:41:36 ’December is traditionally a strong month for stocks, but are headed this month to its worst stock performance in December since 1931, during the Great Depression.‘

Nice work @realDonaldTrump.

Fits right in to the rest of your *presidency.*
i.e., worst performance.
3665 2018-12-22 05:41:19 Because it all has global implications, from economy to stocks to trade to travel and maple syrup exports. Also like, you know, this ain't North Korea, so I can say things without facing  “re-education” in Camp 22.
3666 2018-12-22 05:40:54 I was actually 60/40 cash/stocks. began to question my allocation last Monday before the downfall. I’m glad I didn’t break and I started going from cash to stocks, slowly, up until this Friday.
3667 2018-12-22 05:40:40 Of course, adding U.S. stocks to EEM and VWO would be bullish
3668 2018-12-22 05:40:28 A 0.5 to 1% risk per trade is a must for more individual stocks and 2% max risk for etfs
3669 2018-12-22 05:40:24 I suspect many saw it coming and shorted the tech stocks that have been heavily hit. They made money.
3670 2018-12-22 05:40:23 Bet he wished he had sold them financial stocks are in the crapper now.

3672 2018-12-22 05:39:58 U.S. stocks sank to a 17-month low to close out their worst week since August 2011, with every sector losing ground and heavy selling in technology shares driving the Nasdaq indexes into a bear market.

3676 2018-12-22 05:35:47 I have thought for a while that many Trumpers or those sitting on the fence would only wake up when the economy turned bad. Well, stocks are free falling and they’re starting to question their idol...#TrumpResign
3677 2018-12-22 05:34:47 These uneducated people giving their money. And we Educated people looking at our stocks going down.
3678 2018-12-22 05:33:34 Johnny Lambo is the Paul Peirce of stocks. #TheTruth ...everyone hates him but value always backs him up. Just like Peirce....his shots always walked the talk.
3679 2018-12-22 05:33:30 God I hope he does this. Stocks soar, QE 4. Dollar drop BTC Moons. Sounds like everyone wins for 6-12 months, then, the Apocalypse.
3680 2018-12-22 05:32:20 Sounds like stocks are on sale! Great, because I get more money soon to buy them!
3681 2018-12-22 05:31:55 1. Corp tax cuts. 2. Corps buy own stock with tax windfall. 3. Stock price rises-everybody happy. 4. Trump effs up trade relationships by going nuts, stocks fall and fall. 5. All the money from tax cuts gone, still 1.5 trillion shortfall in US
3682 2018-12-22 05:31:37 The great economy is why stocks are falling. Great economy means the Fed raises interest rates, thus stocks fall. Are you guys new to the world?
3683 2018-12-22 05:31:27 S&P 500: down to 18% of stocks above their 200-day moving average, fewest since the low in August 2015.
3684 2018-12-22 05:31:27 A shrewd investor sells stocks when the market is still expensive. He (or she) knows that the EMH is just a textbook legend.

I have them in my P/f.
3686 2018-12-22 05:30:18 Such as? What has he done? Stocks are plummeting, discourse is staggering, racial hate crimes are on the rise, farmers are struggling and now thousands of government employees are going without pay.
3687 2018-12-22 05:29:55 Don’t worry, everything’s fine according to all the backwards looking variables shirtless Aaron’s relying on. The collective actions of participants in the present - selling stocks like mad - tells us nothing, he says.
3688 2018-12-22 05:29:42 After a trillion dollar lost in Value FANG stocks like AMZN and Netflix are still overvalued
3689 2018-12-22 05:28:47 I wouldn't sell. Trying to time the market usually fails. It also only took three years for stocks to recover from the 2008 crash. But if you have expenses you gotta do what you gotta do
3690 2018-12-22 05:27:09 Trump has reduced himself to a blab machine. He has not accomplished much and it will take fifty years to undo the damage of his Presidency. He will lose votes now that stocks are falling.
3691 2018-12-22 05:25:47 No it's just reduced profits margins because they need to sell the stocks.
3692 2018-12-22 05:23:06 FED Interest
OPEC
Dems winning house

Investor confidence down...sux

(I'm guessing you don't trade stocks )
3693 2018-12-22 05:22:56 This is what happens when the feds raise rates.

Stocks for good companies will go back up, they always do and typically reach higher levels than before. If people hadnt panicked in 08 they would have recovered and been doing quite well.
3694 2018-12-22 05:22:48 Question: the tax cuts went mostly towards companies buying back their own stock. With the stock market crashing, did the lower value of the stocks vaporize the tax cut money?
3695 2018-12-22 05:22:37 Democrats own shutdown, they don't want any wall.

Stocks tank when privately owned FED raise rates.

Union pension promises bankrupt companies. 

Witch hunt DS Mueller

Mattias is need at GITMO.

The Train is revving up speed. Are you ready? #TrustThePlan

It will be glorious.
3696 2018-12-22 05:22:25 I honestly don’t think bump stocks should be owned in America. But you are a furry. So whatever you say is invalid
3697 2018-12-22 05:22:16 heard marami pang stocks sa uptc eh
3698 2018-12-22 05:22:06 Why on earth would you have a high percentage of your nest egg in stocks in your 70's??
3699 2018-12-22 05:20:24 True that they’re great companies. But looks like stocks are now official in a bear market. Sentiment is bad and may go down much further. They also seemed overvalued too.
3700 2018-12-22 05:17:41 Heavens! You realise that such opinions are tantamount to treason against the Crown over here? You’ll be thrown in the stocks Harry.
3701 2018-12-22 05:15:06 When I think of the @GOP, I think of crashing stocks, evaporating retirement accounts, government shutdowns, bumbling foreign policy, and destruction of our environment.
3702 2018-12-22 05:13:32 There is an old maxim on Wall Street...stocks bottom on really bad news. They top on really good news. $SPX
3703 2018-12-22 05:13:27 Stocks go down. Bitcoin goes up. Who would have expected?
3704 2018-12-22 05:13:12 US Stocks are on pace for the worst December since the Great Depression
3705 2018-12-22 05:12:54 That was before he invested in defense stocks.
3706 2018-12-22 05:12:11 Sounds like Trump got it into his head that if he cld get a lackey in at the Fed, he cld order them to cut rates, he prbly believes this wld boost the market. In fact, such obvious ham handed manipulation wld almost certainly cause a collapse in stocks & bonds
3707 2018-12-22 05:11:29 @ATFHQ So I guess the 2nd ammendment really doesn't mean shit to you.  Criminalizing Gun owners who possess bump stocks.
3708 2018-12-22 05:09:37 @SecretaryRoss 
Resign now!  You lied to Americans about bank stocks!

3712 2018-12-22 05:08:08 You think the 1 Oct shooter cared about accuracy or the after massacre condition of his hotel room arsenal, complete with bump stocks? He wanted fire power and little else.
3713 2018-12-22 05:07:45 Review of Oversold stocks. Varun Beverages hits target. Update on Graphite....
3714 2018-12-22 05:07:43 There is no official law regarding bump stocks... still being sold online and in stores in AZ. Hell here in AZ I think you can get one at wallmart.
3715 2018-12-22 05:07:43 Hey errbody… it’s utter disaster!!! The Government has shutdown!!! Just like it does every Friday @ 5:00 Eastern. 

And, horrors! It will be shutdown tomorrow!! Just like every Saturday… see the pattern.

Why don’t stocks tank every Friday in anticipation of the shutdown?
3716 2018-12-22 05:06:57 A few investing lessons from 2018:

1. Avoid something like Bitcoin
2. Don't believe in rumors
3. Never expect small & mid-caps to always perform like 2017
4. Even if the fundamentals are good, quality stocks may not perform as expected
5. Don't let petty issues affect your goals
3717 2018-12-22 05:05:12 Lol, I just rock crocked at falcon 3 times in 1 online match (all his stocks) .... This has to go. Please Nintendo! 
3718 2018-12-22 05:04:51 The Trump administration wants to ban bump stocks. And Republicans are okay with this? You're okay with Americans being treated as a would be criminal?
3719 2018-12-22 05:04:22 From U.S. stocks to Hong Kong real estate, "experts" are urging everyone to remain calm and stay the course. That seems worrisome, don't you think?
3720 2018-12-22 05:04:02 Powell has proven incompetent.  No fed chair has ever hiked rates with stocks down 10% in a month.  It’s a sign of incompetence

3722 2018-12-22 05:01:53 Hakeem Olajuwon had 550 stocks in ONE year. 

The last player to hit 400 stocks was Ben Wallace (416) in '01-02. If Hakeem hadn't got hurt he would have done 350+ stocks first 11 seasons. Robinson 7 years b4 injury.

3724 2018-12-22 05:01:03 My favorite part about New York City is that my local bodega doesn’t ~advertise~ that it stocks my favorite candy...but they always have a bar for me and never judge that I come in for it every day probably twice or thrice a day 
3725 2018-12-22 05:00:25 I hang my stocks from the mantle. Isn’t that the tradition?
3726 2018-12-22 04:59:55 Just heard a Trump supporter talk about why this week’s stock market crash wasn’t so bad:  Because stocks are now a better bargain.

So be sure to pull out all the money you lost and double down America.

Dumb fucker...
3727 2018-12-22 04:59:36 Hardly 5% of stocks giving consistence returns years together. In long term, if you fortunate enough to have those 5% of stocks in your portfolio that's advantage else gone.
3728 2018-12-22 04:58:36 Sold stocks? The impatient paying the patient...
3729 2018-12-22 04:57:45 I should probably have sold all my stocks already, huh
3730 2018-12-22 04:57:05 The man is a narcissist. We all need to support trump for a mental evaluation. The stocks market has done nothing but drop. Our MILITARY is not being treated with respect. We have been lied to cheated swindled and in a crazy mans world! Some one wake me up from this nightmare
3731 2018-12-22 04:56:59 The only reason I would use shorts to cover my stock ownership would be if I actually used my stocks to influence decisions of the board (which I don’t).
3732 2018-12-22 04:55:56 @StkOptionCoach right on trend. No bragging tweets today . Please let me know in advance when there institutional guys you keep braging about to your subs show up . Actually hoping for you to be right soon as I am long stocks as of today.
3733 2018-12-22 04:55:35 So diversify with PM or mining stocks? 
I thought Q indicated some type of FAANG Stock effect?
3734 2018-12-22 04:55:07 So bump stocks were banned this week and gun control advocates don't want to credit Trump and most gun rights advocates don't want to blame him which has resulted in complete silence. Tribalism at it's finest.
3735 2018-12-22 04:55:02 I love how y’all only report stocks when it’s negative but when President Trump had the stock market set over 70 record high closing y’all fail to report why?
3736 2018-12-22 04:53:30 Mani is already running out of stocks..only his ego left in him these days 
3737 2018-12-22 04:53:27 P/E are somewhat dependent on interest rate. Say that we know that Fed will keep 0% for 30 years, that will actually motivate owning stocks with higher P/E (bc the alternative is rubbish too). Otherwise it’s a greater-fool game (which is ok if we know what we are doing).
3738 2018-12-22 04:52:06 Stocks have been falling since the Dems won Congress and will continue to do so.
3739 2018-12-22 04:51:56 I think the current economic climate calls for a well diversified portfolio which includes stocks, property and side hustles.
3740 2018-12-22 04:51:51 Suppose it distracts people from the worst week for stocks in 10 years.
3741 2018-12-22 04:51:27 Don't worry Larry, the hillbillies have a GoFundMe page - although this might make me sell my Mountain Dew and Opioid stocks. #YeeHaw

3747 2018-12-22 04:47:49 Btw a little late to the party. USA pulling out, stocks dropped 4K, Iran is rising. Good toasts to make to the new year
3748 2018-12-22 04:47:20 Noooo that assumes most Americans own stocks
3749 2018-12-22 04:47:12 But what about 401(k)? That’s savings they are in stocks for most no ? 
3750 2018-12-22 04:46:25 Money flowing to the more defensive stocks was another clue
3751 2018-12-22 04:46:22 Those idiots are always surprised when pumpkin stocks go up around Halloween
3752 2018-12-22 04:46:19 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to improve your autism
3753 2018-12-22 04:46:04 Kelly and Mattis were only stabilizing men around him. Now both gone. Who is there to tell him NO! Be afraid. Be very afraid. Investigations, stocks tanking, resignations, pull outs leading to vacuums in Syria and Afghanistan. What’s next?

3764 2018-12-22 04:42:45 What kind of degenerate spends all day DM people about stocks. I could understand models but stocks?!?
3765 2018-12-22 04:42:37  I'd really just like to see him truly embarrassed or humbled in some way. Like they used to do in the old days. Put them in one of those shackles or stocks or whatever they're called in the public square and pelt him with garbage or something.
3766 2018-12-22 04:41:14 YO heres another. stop playing 2 stocks this isn't smash 4 anymore MOVE ON
3767 2018-12-22 04:41:06 I don’t really pick stocks, I only buy ETFs/index funds and one share of Tesla so far
3768 2018-12-22 04:40:57 After the stock market's worst week in at least a decade, the P/E ratio of the S&P 500 is still 20% above its historical average. Maybe we'll get a REAL correction and #stocks will truly be worth buying again!
3769 2018-12-22 04:39:38 Any insight on active manager performance vs passive during this correction? With most stocks down more than the headline indices I’m guessing it doesn’t look good.

3773 2018-12-22 04:38:17 Stocks are disconnected from macroeconomy IMHO.. and 10s would have a hard time to rally from current levels with robust retail sales and tight labor market
3774 2018-12-22 04:38:10 come on people are you waiting for these stocks to go up high and then buy it...it is on sale nowadays! what say you cramer?

3777 2018-12-22 04:37:20 I thought you believed what Mark Taylor prophet told MAGA and QANON followers? Didn't you get assurances from Psyop that they framed Trump? Gee, there were arrests, but Flynn and Cohen admitted they acted for Trump. Wonder if MAGA will like their DOW stocks crashing? Money talks.

3780 2018-12-22 04:35:31 what about the people giving stocks for Christmas
3781 2018-12-22 04:35:03 How’s the economy doing @realDonaldTrump? Hmmm Stocks aren’t looking too good under your watch huh? You Orange fat fuck
3782 2018-12-22 04:33:40 Do you want to sell me any more stocks? I'm looking to buy
3783 2018-12-22 04:33:14 Does that mean Im not annoyed at pledis?  Yes I am,  but until seventeen can stand on their own, I will support them until they could buy the comany's stocks.  U want a company to listen to u?  Go buy their stocks.
3784 2018-12-22 04:33:10 All my stocks are in the negative... something is about to happen
3785 2018-12-22 04:33:05 Glass of wine, looking at some stocks, doing a little trading.. great Friday
3786 2018-12-22 04:32:58 He picks stocks about as well as he picks winners from games
3787 2018-12-22 04:32:30 Never focus on the index but on individual stocks....a core portfolio of ten stocks can be your best bet to beat the markets hands down!!
3788 2018-12-22 04:30:52 The biggest thing is their are no perfect systems. No holy grails. If intraday, I would focus on general markets only like $spx. Stay away from individual stocks in play. Way too many mouths to feed and 90+% of stocks follow market anyway. What’s your edge right now?
3789 2018-12-22 04:30:47 No masters, but once my husband retires....purchase a 2nd home in Colorado & about 4 to 5 million of stocks, pension, 401k, social security, and IRA accounts.   Stop putting an image of your neighbor car.  Or your brother car.  
3790 2018-12-22 04:30:07 A complicit, lying news media at it again! Stocks are still at 22,000 which it never was under Obama! Trump’s worst is still trillions ahead of Obama’s best, so enough of your phony panic attacks!
3791 2018-12-22 04:29:18 Ruffling feathers is one thing, but Trump has driven us into the ground. Stocks are down almost 500 points. This is more proof of why Trump had five bankruptcies. Fact check it
3792 2018-12-22 04:28:39 Stocks to cash is not driven by yields by bit investor panic. Bonds are insanely cheap, but it will take a while to realize. Unlike with other assets increasing supply is bullish for USTs.
3793 2018-12-22 04:27:58 Ever look at your Robinhood stocks and linger on that one green stock in a  of red? What are you playing at buddy? How are you the only one bucking the trend?
3794 2018-12-22 04:27:24 Stocks crashing.  Withdrawal from Syria makes Putin happy!.  Mattis resigns.  Government shutdown.  Rome is Burning.  Trump must be dealt with.
3795 2018-12-22 04:26:50 50 stocks surged above 5% in yesterday's carnage is unbelievable.
3796 2018-12-22 04:26:14 Stock market is low... my joints looking weak... but I’m about to buy more stocks...
3797 2018-12-22 04:25:18 Time to start accumulating gold stocks..primarily producers and then juniors.
3798 2018-12-22 04:24:41 「US stocks suffer worst week in a decade」
アメリカ株は、この１０年で最悪の週を経験した
中国との貿易の緊張、利上げ、そして起こりうる政府機関の閉鎖が、市場を混乱させ、アメリカ株は、この１０年間における週の下落の最悪の一つを経験した。
3799 2018-12-22 04:24:30 Stocks going down in price will eventually attract buyers. Algos will adjust, or maybe adjust, remember knight?... but Apple down a third.., pretty sure that buyers will come back... always have before.
3800 2018-12-22 04:23:10 Right now wasn’t the best time to invest in stocks...
3801 2018-12-22 04:20:46 Why should they hate corruption?  They seem to thrive on it, it seems to me.  I guess that is only when their favorite stocks are shooting up!  I think the market is a criminal enterprise built to fleece the average American.
3802 2018-12-22 04:20:22 They own stocks. 
It is one and the same priority
3803 2018-12-22 04:20:09 It's perfectly normal. US had inflated FAANG stocks... Correction is necessary now and then.
3804 2018-12-22 04:20:05 I disagree and on a simple premise: if you want to have stocks, go public; but if you want to issue a cryptocurrency, stay private.  Make it a choice where publicly traded corporations cannot have their caked and manipulate it, too.  Do we want Facebook-based monetary policy?
3805 2018-12-22 04:19:19 @POTUS …. what is going on that you allowed this to happen. I have supported you through out your campaign about the rule of law. Gov. must pay for taking property. ATF lied to you bump stocks still requires the trigger to be pulled each time to fire unlike an automatic that ..
3806 2018-12-22 04:18:52 And maybe more infuriating, none of them rely on their government pay to live.
They have stocks, many were born rich, and when the leave they'll cash out big.
3807 2018-12-22 04:18:31 Hello! Yess we will! As soon as our supplier secure stocks we will open agad po!

3810 2018-12-22 04:18:00 I would say that millions of people who rebalance 60/40 portfolios and buy stock every two weeks is stabilizing. Then again, the feedback loop between stocks and consumer spendimg becomes greater.
3811 2018-12-22 04:17:42 ...and then he banned bump stocks, and hasn't done shit about the wall, and has kept Hillary out of prison, and instead of shipping the burrito factories back as a familial unit kept them separate to do nothing but waste time. I support*ed* him back in early 2017 but nowadays...
3812 2018-12-22 04:17:07 Do they own stocks & adjust policy accordingly? Like Ross? Prioritize!
3813 2018-12-22 04:16:55 5 years from now people will be wishing they had bought now whole stocks are on sale.
3814 2018-12-22 04:15:23 @POTUS Mr President the ATF with your support have deemed bump stocks bad and now have banned them requiring the owners of these accessories to destroy or turn them in WITHOUT ANY COMPESATION. This is illegal according to the Constitution the gov. taking of property MUST be paid
3815 2018-12-22 04:15:18 Yeah we got change all right. He stalled a booming economy, tanked stocks, add a trillion in debt, evaded 50 million in taxes, brought a swamp to Washington that have blown billions. We now have a corrupt president who is under 17 investigations. Next time make a better choice.
3816 2018-12-22 04:15:02 Couple days in the stocks for both.  In the town square of course. They cant be beyond redeption, right?  Then again.

3819 2018-12-22 04:13:35 The government hasn’t been shutdown but for a few hours and the news is saying that stocks are as bad as the recession 10 years ago. Look what the GOP continues to do. SMH
3820 2018-12-22 04:13:25 If the wall is built, I’m investing in ladder and shovel stocks.
3821 2018-12-22 04:12:51 If Trump had stocks, it’s value would be around five or six cents now. @GOP support a moron.
3822 2018-12-22 04:12:06 It's falling down on global stocks!
3823 2018-12-22 04:12:05 Some events gave great selling opportunity-
1) Modi won 2014 elections. 
2) GST speculation - logistics stocks. 
3) UDAY Scheme - This will solve everything selling opportunity. 
4) GST passed - unorganized to organized.
5) PSU banks recapitalization.
6) OMCs things have changed.
3824 2018-12-22 04:10:37 Sup yo ! I seem to have violated that PDT rule again..lol. like the 10th time..what r u looking at mon..been doing well on spy but want something different..RSI on a lot of stocks is due for turn around, can't go to zero, but love puts.."(the mean marine)".
3825 2018-12-22 04:10:26 This ship is not going down. The market was volatile and most stocks took a hit. But as FAANG continues to lose money investors are going to be searching for a new investment. And that will end up being cannabis 
3826 2018-12-22 04:09:54 Crypto will outperform stocks over the next decade.
3827 2018-12-22 04:09:34 I am still amazed that government officials with any kind of legislative power are allowed to own stocks at all. At the least they should be banned from anything that can even be tangentially linked to their specific areas of legislative power. This is crony capitalism.
3828 2018-12-22 04:08:52 Uranium stocks will be the best investment. High upside and nuclear fuel cost only makes up 5% of the operating cost.
3829 2018-12-22 04:08:48 I don't to talk about lazy. No matter how lazy they r, cut welfare will make us suffer more. Welfare is tax cut, put $ into market, when tax cut out $ into market, cutting welfare will take $ back from market, it hurts tax cut. Get your $ out of stocks when market rebounds Feb.
3830 2018-12-22 04:08:32 Worst December for stocks since the 1930’s- tired of #winning @realDonaldTrump
3831 2018-12-22 04:07:50 For the market in general: Considering that we're still extended, Late Feb/Early March.  Markets love to bottom in March.

#stocks #stockmarketcrash #stockmarketcrash $Spy $qqq
3832 2018-12-22 04:06:46 kind of crazy how I just for real really realized I’m saving up to buy a house. Shout out to my Starbucks stocks
3833 2018-12-22 04:06:46 Look at the, sell your stocks if Dow can rebound to 25000 or close, and move 401 to IRA then put in CD. It's not a joke,
3834 2018-12-22 04:06:29 Yeah, gotta raise the rates to cool the market. And it provides a chance to get some value stocks as they dip so I don’t complain.
3835 2018-12-22 04:06:16 Katu Satya 

If fundamentals

 didn't save stocks 3 months ago,

 why would you trust such opinions today?
3836 2018-12-22 04:06:09 Do you need a margin account to short stocks?
3837 2018-12-22 04:05:29 The shutdown is nearly as bad. The stocks dropping hard. Kind of scary.
3838 2018-12-22 04:04:58 online is actually trash
I keep losing my elite to people who have a rule set that came from their ass I seriously question how these people got into elite. 
2 stocks 5 mins
free for all 3 stocks 2 mins

why in elite? there should be a way to ONLY have your ruleset at all times
3839 2018-12-22 04:04:43 i’m getting notifications every day saying all my stocks (and other major ones) are at lows or even 52-week lows, the government is shutting down, and it was 60 degrees today. basically we’re at the precipice of a breakdown of democracy or full on apocalypse
3840 2018-12-22 04:04:18 I sincerely hope all of his companies' stocks drop drastically low, becoming penny stocks, if that!
3841 2018-12-22 04:04:12 I like how apparently you can buy and sell racism now, seeing as it's a commodity.

Those will be the few stocks rising during the full on Grizzly market we're about to hit; good thing that anti-lynching bill passed the Senate, because fuck me, recessions lead to more violence.
3842 2018-12-22 04:04:10 Pulled my $ fr: Stock Market until things settle down. Market is crazy. I lost about 10% in past month. Im 57. Cant afford 2 stay in. Alot of investment firms have Software that Auto trades on Algorythims. I dont like it. Im blaming the Feds right now. Theyre trying 2 tank Stocks
3843 2018-12-22 04:03:58 While stocks crash and everyone deserts your administration.
3844 2018-12-22 04:03:02 $aapl not some overpriced tech stock with triple digit PE ratio.  Not many stocks sporting a 12 PE with this kind of growth, strong balance sheet and market dominance. Safe buy at these levels.
3845 2018-12-22 04:02:19 Good points, but who is controlling the market?  When most of the "experts" and economist that I've listened to over the past couple of weeks think there are lots of undervalued stocks, who keeps selling?  Do Investment Banks move so much money they control the market?
3846 2018-12-22 04:02:09 Look at the never ending asset quality problems and hence profitability of the PSBs. That is the reason the stocks are beaten down.
3847 2018-12-22 04:02:01 Funny I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone do a better job pumping with any company on twitter. That said I have positions in 46 cannabis stocks 
3848 2018-12-22 04:00:49 @MTGStocks Hey Stocks peoples, had some questions for you regarding sourcing. If you can reach out via DM that would be awesome :)
3849 2018-12-22 04:00:46 The social media company fell 6.3% to $124.95 a share, a harder fall than any of the other #FAANG stocks and more than double the 3% decline in the Nasdaq Composite. The decline came in the wake of a Bloomberg report that #Facebook was developing a #stablecoin
3850 2018-12-22 04:00:43 yield curve inversion, stocks in bear market.  two indicators are saying US enters recession in 6 to 12 months. i bet the economists at the Fed know these very well.  the question is can the world handle an American recession now?  or chaos, crisis or worse will happen?
3851 2018-12-22 04:00:37 It's very simple: Bump stocks were invented to circumvent the law.  You all know this.  To try to shout about "rights" and crap now is bullshit.  You knew why it was made.  You knew you shouldn't get one.  You knew you were buying a douche-bag item created by douche-bag.

3856 2018-12-22 03:58:22 The worst December for stocks since 1931 keeps getting worse.
3857 2018-12-22 03:58:02 Ha.  Seriously though.  Guess cash yields enough?  Stocks to cash, not stocks to bonds.  Also wonder at what point the borrowing needs overwhelm.
3858 2018-12-22 03:57:36 WHY TRUMP MUST  BE FIRED:  AT CHRISTMAS, #TrumpShutDown   , Stocks plummeting(Yes that’s your retirement,401k, whatever)GeneralMATTIS resigned in protest of many things but especiallySyria&Afghanistan,Daily lies& hate inducing tweets. And SO important YOU will have NO Healthcare
3859 2018-12-22 03:56:39 I think banning bump stocks is an extremely low hanging fruit when it comes to gun control, but it’s still a good thing.
3860 2018-12-22 03:56:27 Is there no food or medicine outside of the EU? What if - and I may be thinking wildly outside the box here...we were to buy stocks now using some of the 39Bn quid we'll be saving...
3861 2018-12-22 03:55:51 The stocks and whipping post being converted to a delightful and safe playground romp for the guests children
3862 2018-12-22 03:53:28 Watches a youtube video explaining that EA’s stocks have fallen by $21 million: haha nice fuck EA

Scrolls down to the comments to see everyone typing paragraphs about how they deserve it cuz they put a woman in WW2: haha fuck gamers
3863 2018-12-22 03:52:33 The Jensen and Dylon Joint co. We do stocks. We also make joints.
3864 2018-12-22 03:52:32 Really? Enlighten us. How did YOU get bump-stocks banned???
3865 2018-12-22 03:52:10 Is there a way to see what stocks are owned by politicians?  The man has to be getting paid off by defense contractors.
3866 2018-12-22 03:52:07 Bump stocks rule!
3867 2018-12-22 03:50:36 If y'all are buying the #FakeNews that Wall Street's swoon is a reaction to the move to #ShutItDown, then you had better borrow money and buy stocks, which will go back up the 20% when the government starts back up (with or without 50 miles of #BorderWall).
3868 2018-12-22 03:49:04 been goin to Local smash tourneys to try and improve, can barely take 2 stocks on peeps ugh, gunna be a punching bag for quite a while.
3869 2018-12-22 03:48:54 Guess who just got stocks in Apple. 

You niggas are all paying me!
3870 2018-12-22 03:46:14 Man. You even nail it on real stocks.
3871 2018-12-22 03:45:15 If I had a million dollars I honestly would just pay my way thru school and try to invest in something long term (business stocks etc.) that way I’ll never say I’m without or don’t have. Then when I have it I’ll pass it along.
3872 2018-12-22 03:45:02 if you cant kill 3 stocks in 3 minutes maybe youre just bad
3873 2018-12-22 03:43:35 if you're perfered rules are 3 stocks 3 minutes you're adopted
3874 2018-12-22 03:42:02 I am sure that he already did do something, like short a bunch of stocks, before he let his employees loose to rile up the POTUS and tank the market.
3875 2018-12-22 03:41:09 Lol the laughing stocks of the medical community and the intellectual community
3876 2018-12-22 03:40:58 @NRA your support of the infringement on legal owners of bump stocks rights is why I will never donate another cent to you. You sold out to the lefts political pressure.
3877 2018-12-22 03:39:48 something about stock markets rubs that good good part of my brain that involves strategy and planning. every now and again i HAVE to scratch it so i download some stock trading simulation

let me tell you what nows a good time to shimmy in bc stocks are low and nye is soon
3878 2018-12-22 03:39:45 Stocks crater.
3879 2018-12-22 03:39:18 #TrumpResign for lots of low economy in the stocks and people protesting for him to step down!!!!
3880 2018-12-22 03:38:29 Bump stocks are a smoke screen, a red herring, if anything they make assault rifles LESS lethal (in most situations - Vegas not being one of them) because they greatly diminish accuracy and result in wasted ammunition (which is why the military adopted the 3 round burst).
3881 2018-12-22 03:38:22 #TrumpResign besides finally banning bump stocks, this could be the best decision you've ever made, @realDonaldTrump resign, resign, resign...
3882 2018-12-22 03:37:59 I believe those were up for Christmas. You'll probably have to wait till it stocks back up.
3883 2018-12-22 03:37:33 Not for you guys. Losing £21 billion in stocks. I wonder why
3884 2018-12-22 03:37:03 He was beating me pretty handily early on, but as things progressed there were a number of 3 stocks on my end. To be fair though, as always, it's WiFi, so it's nothing to brag about
3885 2018-12-22 03:36:53 view on investing has changed 

passive investing later vs active investing in myself NOW 
(stocks vs skills)

This paycheck: @ECOMMANDY FFCC - can't wait to sink my teeth in it. 
Last paycheck: @SCHM7DT and @StartSellingSSS Online Playbook, BDSC, and SDS

Here's why: (a thread)
3886 2018-12-22 03:36:50 Hey @KellyannePolls Are you going on #FoxNews to rave about the #Trumpeffect of sending stocks on a nosedive?!   #BankruptingAmerica
3887 2018-12-22 03:36:18 MacFarlane was my favorite artist. I loved his Spider-Man work and then later Spawn. I love comics and would rather invest in them than silly stocks (not really) I have a room full (X-Men, Wolverine, GI Joe, Spider-Man). Surprising which ones become worth a lot (and which didn't)
3888 2018-12-22 03:36:16 RT LPLResearch "RT QuintFinancial: Since 1950, the S&P 500 in a midterm year has pulled back an average of 16.9%. BUT, from the closing low in a midterm year, a year later stocks have been higher the last 17 out of 17 times. -- From LPLResearch"
3889 2018-12-22 03:35:42 Wow!  @realDonaldTrump drives country to ruin!  Stocks nosedive.  #GovernmentShutdown over imaginary #Invasion .  Make America Bankrupt again.  Sad!  #DelusionalDonald
3890 2018-12-22 03:34:50 Out of Syria..Farm Bill...Banned Bump Stocks....Criminal Justice...MAGA
3891 2018-12-22 03:34:33 @WeekendInvestng - Hi Alok ! Have been following your updates very frequently and they are really very helpful. Just read a book called stocks on the move by Andreas Cleanow and wanted to understand if one has to learn how to simulate results-what would be a good point to start?
3892 2018-12-22 03:34:00 Funny you mentioned this.. he liquidated his stocks didn't he? Now trying to ruin the market so he can rebuy all his portfolio at a massive discount when he's fresh out of Prez potion. 

***The Long Con***
3893 2018-12-22 03:33:36 Wait until they start securitizing public companies on the #blockchain. 

Bye bye traditional stocks trading at 20, 50 and 100x earnings. 

What a joke.
3894 2018-12-22 03:33:35 I buy crypto and have zero concerns about stocks 
3895 2018-12-22 03:33:05 @stlouisfed are stocks at the lowest levels since 2013 too?  Seems related.
3896 2018-12-22 03:32:44 Pssst. You failed. On EVERYTHING this week. Stocks are tanking. Your supposed deal-making prowess is as as small as your hands. You failed. Over and over and over. You are the farthest thing from a leader.
3897 2018-12-22 03:32:30 Hi @asicmedia, @AusFedPolice, @ASX now that you’re all busting to bring the banks to heal, how’s about someone look into the insider trading on bank stocks pre fed budget 2016?? @HumanHeadline reported it to AFP, now let’s do something about it.. @auspol
3898 2018-12-22 03:32:14 This year, there have been Rs. 23.1 billion of outflows from stocks and Rs. 148.2 billion from Government securities, the latest data from the Bourse and Central Bank showed.
3899 2018-12-22 03:31:20 It's because of the Fed rate hikes. The economy is so hot, the inflation hawks are scared. They feel they need to raise rates to keep inflation from happening at all. This drives the sell in stocks and the media fearmongering drives even more selling.
3900 2018-12-22 03:30:32 It's not just the "country club crowd", friend.
Many of us who work hard don't have a pension plan other than an IRA. Most IRAs are tied to stocks, so a lot of retirement savings are 
3901 2018-12-22 03:30:18 @realDonaldTrump has repeatedly pointed to market gains as proof his policies are working & country is thriving under his leadership. Unless end-of-year rally emerges, 2018 will be worst year for U.S. stocks since 2008 & S&P 500 on track for worst Dec since the Great Depression.
3902 2018-12-22 03:30:08 Off topic but...

I'M SO HAPPY TODAY WIEEEEE I THINK I CAN GET TO BUY THE NCT AND RV SEASON GREETINGS IN CNA TOMORROOOOOW AAAAAAAA I HOPE THERE'S STOCKS WHEN I COME TO ISETANN TOMORROOOOOW WATCH ME MY WALLET WILL GO BANKRUPT IN JUST ONE VISIT DFJGFKDSDJFG
3903 2018-12-22 03:29:29 Least-discussed item of the week: that the 10yr note contract rallied 5/32s on stocks selling off 6% post-Fed.  God help 10s if stock stage some sort of bounce.
3904 2018-12-22 03:29:13 Post of the Day.  Does anyone other than Washington elites care what this guy thinks?  He probably has 2 friends who aren't involved in political circles.  His hairdresser and his broker who buys his defense stocks
3905 2018-12-22 03:28:26 He'll  say that the stocks went up so much since he stole the election that it will still be higher if stocks fall. WTF.
3906 2018-12-22 03:28:02 US stocks have their worst week in over 7 years... but I thought Trump was a business man who knew how to improve the economy...
3907 2018-12-22 03:27:36 Or when I sd and they sd for me. Naw bruh I sd it's Ok I have 3 stocks now and will make this comeback
3908 2018-12-22 03:26:47 #ImpeachTrump @realDonaldTrump time to step down and swallow your pride. Your wall will never be built, and your promises are broken. Stocks are down- which is your success of your time in office, with your falsified business acumen. 

Worst president in our nation’s history.
3909 2018-12-22 03:23:48 Still a possibility of more downside in my opinion, but I actually plan on looking out for the same thing for when it does reverse. I’ll do some research and let ya know what ones I find that I like. Fundamentally, I’m not sure how strong a lot of current top tech stocks will do.
3910 2018-12-22 03:20:19 Trump just banned your bump stocks. Deal with it.
3911 2018-12-22 03:20:16 But global economy still vulnerable and has way more debt and as much interconnectedness as 2008.  Fed has to pick which of its two “children” to save, between three: the dollar, Treasurys, and stocks.  I think it lets the dollar sink.
3912 2018-12-22 03:19:54 But now their stocks have given back all the gains from their buybacks and we are stuck with the debt.
3913 2018-12-22 03:19:27 And it be laggy matches with 2 stocks and t-bagging after every kill. Feels like home.
3914 2018-12-22 03:19:01 I fucking LOVE taking shots at particular stocks when the ENTIRE market is down 20%+! Hey dipshit, u weren’t right about xyz, the whole market is crumbling fuckwad!
3915 2018-12-22 03:18:29 Will ditch low float stocks and try to get better trading real companies
3916 2018-12-22 03:18:12 I’m gonna need my stocks to start going back up pls and thank u
3917 2018-12-22 03:18:10 likely be closed are have main workers not available. Are president does not care for American workers . only cares about his friends Saudi Arabia and Putin, Russia and his high class rich folks. I hope they enjoyed there stocks being worthless due to trump.

3922 2018-12-22 03:17:26 Fuck trading stocks, let’s trade feet pics
3923 2018-12-22 03:17:09 We had a meeting back in early November telling us that the stocks and vcp make it to where we are actually making 17 an hour. Then they took it away for the pay raise and said we are actually making more money this way.
3924 2018-12-22 03:16:42 @kdlmanagement007 sell some and load into another stocks use that stock gain to move back into $CHK, oil will be down  for a while..
3925 2018-12-22 03:15:17 Do you own shares of these entire lists you’ve posted? Are these on you Buy list or Sell list and can you tell us more why you selected these. Their all penny stocks I take it?
3926 2018-12-22 03:15:14 He banned bump stocks

He has been working on prison reform and legalizing CBD oil
He is pulling us out of a needless war....
But keep going
3927 2018-12-22 03:14:10 Do you own shares of these entire lists you’ve posted? Are these on you Buy list or Sell list and can you tell us more why you selected these. Their all penny stocks I take it?
3928 2018-12-22 03:14:09 Who is dumb enough to obey any kind of law against bump stocks? 

It's an INFRINGEMENT. Unconstitutional laws are not laws of the land. They are FOREIGN LAWS and FOREIGN LAWS need not be obeyed on our land.
3929 2018-12-22 03:14:03 All punditry aside.
When you’re hurting financially because your stocks have taken a chunk out of your life &/or retirement savings, you’re really not listening to anyone’s philosophy. You’re hurting all over. And sadly, the pundits hurting more.
Investors want is a ray of #hope.
3930 2018-12-22 03:14:00 Stocks are down as low as they were during the Great Depression, nice.
3931 2018-12-22 03:13:50 Stocks plunged as Harley-Davidson, Inc. unveiled a delightful zipper today.
3932 2018-12-22 03:13:45 Govt shut down means 800,00 federal employees wont get paid

Affecting roughly 2.5 million American if each houseld has 3 people

They will need to sell stocks to raise cash to pay bills

The Wall Street sell off will only get worse

You can all thank Fonald at @realDonaldTrump
3933 2018-12-22 03:13:37 apple stocks rise by 10%.
3934 2018-12-22 03:13:35 2019 is going to be built on INVESTMENTS - we saving that money and putting it in stocks, vacays and in spoiling ourselves ladies
3935 2018-12-22 03:12:46 Omg no. I wonder if any of the master of malt stocks are affected
3936 2018-12-22 03:12:18 If you think a law should be passed banning bump stocks i can at least respect your opinion.  however rewording a current law to say what ever you want is not cool, and i will not respect your opinion on that.  I might even call you mean names.
3937 2018-12-22 03:12:03 Your presidents promises were worthless to start with.  He is a con man and you are all fools and worse.  Obama delivered slow steady growth in jobs and stocks - and healthcare!  Every time you vote R they deliver a crash and a depression
3938 2018-12-22 03:11:45 I was expecting new recruits but heard this time they have revised the strategy of converting experienced pumpers of sh** stocks to be $Grat-ified thru 500k options.

Be careful folks -     will be flooding Twitter glorifying $GRAT - play safe and do your due diligence.
3939 2018-12-22 03:11:45 My stocks are doing great. Jobs are plentiful. I hate what he’s doing in Syria but America’s economy is booming
3940 2018-12-22 03:09:51 Man oh man.... I am in Texas and I know so many people who have drunk the koolaide. Primarily they believe Trump is going to help them make MONEY! I laugh every time the stock market goes down because one of my clients touted Trumps effect on stocks. Trump is bad for our country.
3941 2018-12-22 03:08:47 If I owned any US stocks, I would sell them now! I would not buy any US stocks at this time. This move in the markets appears to be serious, it may be nothing, but I believe it is significant.
3942 2018-12-22 03:08:08 The next years could be an amazing bull run .. stay invested .. consumption is still the theme ... next ten years can give 5 - 6 stocks who can be 100X baggers .. every panic and every elections gives opportunity to buy them
3943 2018-12-22 03:08:05 Broken charts everywhere. Looks like it will take the markets weeks to chill out, bottom and give individual stocks better looking setups to bust up from Daria’s boxes
3944 2018-12-22 03:07:28 The last couple of months have been very tumultuous.

 If your time horizon is in weeks or months and you were invested in stocks you should be panicking. 

If your time horizon is in years, like most of us, don't panic, stay disciplined, and consider putting excess cash to work
3945 2018-12-22 03:05:02 Me: stocks the house with Grand Marnier, barbancourt & patrón. 
Also me: downs a bottle of barefoot moscato in a night.
3946 2018-12-22 03:04:33 I killed Corrin all three stocks with pichu thunder from center stage at like 30 LOL

3948 2018-12-22 03:03:47 A Bitcoin smear campaign from Bloomberg and JP tells me that institutions didn’t accumulate as much as they wanted yet. The were on TV in late Nov telling retail investors to buy stocks because the rally was back. Now that they dumped stocks they are desperate to run crypto down
3949 2018-12-22 03:03:44 I enjoyed throwing him in the stocks while the children pelted him with rotten vegetables though..
3950 2018-12-22 03:01:53 The most dangerous terrorists who would do harm to us are not OUTSIDE our borders

They are already INSIDE our borders

They are the angry white, typically Christian male nutjob who likes using assault weapons made automated with bump stocks, killing 100 people en masse
3951 2018-12-22 03:01:15 I was just saying to a friend (re: mining stocks): A lot of people forget that not all mineral deposits are equal. Punters should invest in a company who's projects will make big profits whatever the price of the commodity being exploited does. Otherwise there is too much risk.
3952 2018-12-22 03:00:48 Let’s put blame where it needs to reside, Trump hasn’t changed, what has, western world is arresting Chinese operatives, Powell listening to globalists, brexit, eu uncertainmany leadership changes in the next year, uncertainty driving profit taking in stocks, tax bill more profit
3953 2018-12-22 03:00:37 I stress ate last night.  Then woke up at 3:30 this morning and couldn’t get back to sleep. Went into work at 5:45, since I was awake. Transferred my entire 401k out of stocks. That helped some.
3954 2018-12-22 02:59:53 Of course, the government shutdown will only make stocks fall further.
3955 2018-12-22 02:59:17 Hey, #MAGA's, how are those 401k's faring now that stocks are dropping like rocks?  Trump/Republican economic policies created volatile markets - as was predicted!
3956 2018-12-22 02:59:08 He's wrong. Majority of stocks are institutional holders not individuals.
3957 2018-12-22 02:58:50 Who even needs or wants bump stocks. Useless pieces of plastic or "polyurethane". Waste of ammo. Keep em tight and one round is enough. Semper fi
3958 2018-12-22 02:56:03 I wonder if the CEO of Google had insider info about the crash because he started selling his stocks at whip speed right after testifying before congress.
3959 2018-12-22 02:55:58 Stocks haven't been this cheap in 6 months. Dont miss the rally ahead
3960 2018-12-22 02:55:39 Stocks plunged again on Friday, bringing the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s losses for the week to nearly 7% and ending its worst week since the financial crisis in 2008.

Congratulations, you are most definitely winning! You can add this to your list of accomplishments!
3961 2018-12-22 02:55:25 #trade Behind-the-Scenes Conversation: What Am I Missing With These Beaten-Down Offshore Drilling Stocks?

Ensco and Transocean continue to trade at a substantial discount to book value. But with oil producers finally starting to spend offshore, I like their prospects. What …
3962 2018-12-22 02:54:02 Are there any stocks that you were like “man I love that company but the valuation needs to be 50% less?”

Anything that has actually reached rhat 50% mark?
3963 2018-12-22 02:54:01 When things were going up I always credit Obama for our prosperity when confronting them. 

Trump inherited a record stock market and now it’s going down because stocks hate chaos. #TrumpResign.
3964 2018-12-22 02:53:46 .@ABC Lame news media never wants to tell the REAL story: Dems and Anarchist liberal George Soros are colluding to bring down stocks and 401ks of My Poorly Educated. Low-energy Wilbur @SecretaryRoss unethical investments are hugely down too!
3965 2018-12-22 02:53:24 His wishes don’t control the Fed. As it should be. But that’s irrelevant. Stocks began tanking with the idiotic tariff war.
3966 2018-12-22 02:53:05 and AMZN is still overpriced and well above the 52-week low of $1,160.  More to follow especially for the momentum stocks like Netflix and AMZN.  There is some value in Google, AAPL and MSFT though.
3967 2018-12-22 02:52:53 Except that ATF doesn't have the authority to ban bump stocks. 

Only congress can do that, kid.
3968 2018-12-22 02:52:32 This weekend find 5 stocks that will be higher end of 2020 assuming the market ends 10 percent lower from here
3969 2018-12-22 02:52:15 LOL fucking sexual marketplace value he says. Show me this sexual marketplace with stats please. Can I buy stocks in the sexual marketplace?
3970 2018-12-22 02:51:34 What I saw in Japan was nominal GDP kept growing till the mid 90s but I believe stocks had died much before that.
3971 2018-12-22 02:51:11 Good I think your okay if you don’t have stocks in healthcare, crypto currency, or tech because they were all at the worse with tariffs on Chinese goods. And don’t let a shutdown scare you to much it involves any government facilities and you and Torree don’t work there!!
3972 2018-12-22 02:50:10 It would be very good for Trump’s shares in steel stocks. Trump is a genius...at screwing people to line his own pockets.  He’s not going to change his stripes at his age.
3973 2018-12-22 02:49:49 You only get your money back if he doesn’t transfer the money into a personal bank account in the 30 some days. After that you’ll be hiring a lawyer. 

Stocks haven’t gone down since Dems took the House - take another look genius. Mutual funds aren’t going to cover it. 
3974 2018-12-22 02:49:40 If $5 billion is allocated for the wall in this budget, followed by a hundred-odd billion later, two stocks that will benefit the most are Halliburton $HAL and Jacobs Engineering $JEC

They're the only two US engineering/construction firms capable of serving as project managers
3975 2018-12-22 02:49:10 Announcement: All customers who are rude tonight shall be put in the stocks!
3976 2018-12-22 02:48:52 I'm down 15.68 percent just over the past 2 months so I know damn sure mine didn't. His is probably down too he just one of those people that won't admit when they fucked up. Went up. Gtfoh. He's probably googling what stocks actually went up right now so he can have a come back
3977 2018-12-22 02:47:36 Same except for stocks
3978 2018-12-22 02:47:34 STOCK MARKET SAYS
The first losing year for stocks in nearly a decade!
3979 2018-12-22 02:47:33 Looking at my stocks, all my longs in the red. It’s a good thing I’m an active trader and my longs all have dividends. Wish I didn’t sell a few inverse etfs early
3980 2018-12-22 02:46:29 Do you know what stocks are? Or even a basic savings account? Jesus, finish high school.
3981 2018-12-22 02:46:27 As to comparing the past decade returns of #btc to stock market returns, that’s not a valid comparison. It’s like winning the lottery & thinking you made a wise choice compared to investing in stocks. It is a unique lucky period & not repeatable. And ex ante it was a bad decision
3982 2018-12-22 02:46:06 #TrumpResign You said you would. A real man does not break a promise. Are you real or fake?  #stocks #shutdown
3983 2018-12-22 02:45:56 stocks
3984 2018-12-22 02:45:36 God I'm so happy we're running 3 stocks again.
3985 2018-12-22 02:45:22 Stocks dont just respond to one thing.
3986 2018-12-22 02:45:11 can those spikes be correlated with stocks getting removed from the s&p 500? those indexes don't really mean anything
3987 2018-12-22 02:44:53 Let's go! 3 stocks! Final Destination!
3988 2018-12-22 02:44:48 Trump has bankrupt America. and now we’re in a recession. What’s happened? The incredibly long period of low volatility greased by Trump pumping stocks, sparked overuse of popular and profitable short volatility products. 1/
3989 2018-12-22 02:43:38 stocks rise by 1%.
3990 2018-12-22 02:42:54 Not sure about 3 stocks but the extra maps are tempting me
3991 2018-12-22 02:42:36 .@realDonaldTrump GREAT JOB!! Worst week for stocks in 10 years! You’ve outdone yourself. 

I think it’s time for you to leave.
3992 2018-12-22 02:42:10 Why His Majesty King Trump is so obsessed with concrete wall and not technology solution !! Could be that HE owns stocks in the construction companies ??
3993 2018-12-22 02:41:11 2019 short stocks long live bitcoin
3994 2018-12-22 02:39:26  I scored a 75%...never did much with penny stocks, although a frac sand company I owned nearly became one
3995 2018-12-22 02:38:33 Real peculiar how trump is pushing this steel slat barrier to the point where the boarder patrol won't be paid. Who is  designers & manufacturers profiting, while stocks take a trump bankruptcy dive? #TrumpResign
3996 2018-12-22 02:38:15 This the lowest the stocks been since 2008 chile
3997 2018-12-22 02:37:49 This is an excellent buying opportunity—look at it as a Christmas sale on stocks!
3998 2018-12-22 02:37:46 To the people who do 3 stocks 3 minutes
Fuck you #SmashBrosUltimate
3999 2018-12-22 02:37:37 The first year is extremely typical of a new administration. What is unusual is that after midterms stocks usually do extremely well. Not for donald and matty! Now try to counter all the other points that I made!
4000 2018-12-22 02:37:23 And same day seven girls die of malnutrition in Sindh and 10 die at child birth and 10 000 children are taken into child labour and 2000 housed in shelter homes and Gatwick airport is closed and America stocks go crumbling!

All this due to PTI government.
4001 2018-12-22 02:37:16 Sitting at dinner next to two Middle Eastern “Americanized” dudes chatting about their stocks and investments and how #underarmour points going up. And one says “it’s because of trump” that  I lost $60,000.... mind you he’s driving a 2007 Nissan Altima 
4002 2018-12-22 02:36:28 Wow, the CRISPR stocks $CRSP $EDIT and $NTLA got absolutely creamed today. Damn 
4003 2018-12-22 02:36:17 My stocks are doing horrible. Fuck u president bitch
4004 2018-12-22 02:35:59 True I’ll do 3 jobs plus stocks
4005 2018-12-22 02:35:37 Saw that, I think a few deals are being made behind the scenes and a few select stocks are showing some signs of the announcements. Reading the T leaves
4006 2018-12-22 02:34:52 Stocks moved another leg lower after U.S. trade rep Navarro says doing a trade deal with China in 90 days could difficult.

4009 2018-12-22 02:32:32 My dad stocks the fridge with modelos because he knows what time it is
4010 2018-12-22 02:32:11 What do they expect? When value guys buy growth stocks, whose left to buy? No incremental demand = no more upside.
4011 2018-12-22 02:31:51 The likely real economic impact from stocks going from 10-20% expensive to fair-ish is probably smaller than financial journos think
4012 2018-12-22 02:31:48 How in the world does EIA get an increase in crude stocks? It just started to fall and should continue to fall. Where is the increase going to come from? Imports should be falling soon and exports rising with pipelines coming online. WTI should clearly be above $60.
4013 2018-12-22 02:31:41 Even indirectly related to stocks is very weak, for example: #preferred stock etf $PPF and #convertible bond etf $CWB
4014 2018-12-22 02:30:20 Stocks started tanking when interest rates starting climbing against our President’s wishes. That’s on the left leaners!!!
4015 2018-12-22 02:30:00 Here's a question a multitude of retirees need to have answered....will Social Security checks be issued without delay this month, should the shutdown last through/past Christmas ? This is a lifeline for millions of Seniors who do not enjoy the security of stocks or savings accts
4016 2018-12-22 02:29:25 Pretty sure they are betting against stocks at this point.

4019 2018-12-22 02:27:50 Saw a funny Stat on #Fintwit recently, @GrantMBeasley put:call ratio was much higher on ETF than single stocks. Cowards : )

4021 2018-12-22 02:27:17 $HMNY I seen penny stocks jump above .02 to .15 .50 to $1.00+ due to email campaign in OTC stocks... You will never know ... I am hold

4027 2018-12-22 02:24:24 The shutdown is for government facilities if they can’t figure out the spending budget for border control. And I’m concerned about the stocks as well this is the worse week in the DOW Nasdaq and s&p 500 since the crash of 1987. I don’t know what stocks you have but double check
4028 2018-12-22 02:24:19 Seeing lots of “there’s no leverage” comments. There’s a ton of #%€£~¥ leverage. When you’re 3.5% in equity on your mortgage and investing in stocks as the only way to pay off that mortgage, you’re leveraged.
4029 2018-12-22 02:24:07 Nasdaq is major index with technology stocks

FAANG
Facebook
Apple
Amazon
Netflix
Google

Index when falling 20% from it's highs confirms it's bear market. 

S&P and Dow 30 still near 17% nasdaq above 21% fall lead by FAANG shares.
4030 2018-12-22 02:23:50 Hey @NRA. You wanna do your members’ a huge favor and buy their bump stocks? So, some of your good patron life members don’t go to prison and miss the next 10 annual conventions?
4031 2018-12-22 02:23:44 Exactly.  Investors had decent allocations back in 2008 in both underlying & stocks, hence the selloff.  Polar opposites now, investors are missing this point.  Patience will pay big time, clearly with ups and downs along way.
4032 2018-12-22 02:23:03 Seattle (WA) Times-Business: As markets tumble, tech stocks hit a rare and ominous milestone
4033 2018-12-22 02:22:06 I love how there is $0 allocated to a retirement fund or stocks of any sort too
4034 2018-12-22 02:21:47 <Bitcoin crash after big, speculative run-up>

World: They deserved it.

<Stocks fall moderately after big, speculative run-up fueled by decade-long central bank policy>

World: This is a dystopian nightmare without end.
4035 2018-12-22 02:20:22 Stocks tumble;
Jobs Growth?;
Government shuts down, again - (Under complete RNC control);
USSR obtaining all ever dreamed;
Military abandonment;
DNC Massive Victories...

For those Trump lovers, might want to look closer.

4038 2018-12-22 02:18:37 Bitcoin has been compared to:

Gold
Stocks
Money
Scams
Oil
Internet
Companies
Dot com bubble

The internet got compared to fax and phones, now the internet is the internet, we do not compare it to anything.

Bitcoin is Bitcoin

4039 2018-12-22 02:18:36 If I were a dictator I will abolish on my first day in office all joint stock corporations where absentee shareholders can buy and sell stocks for short term speculative gains.

4042 2018-12-22 02:18:12 Thanks to the dumb effing Republicans, we lost all we gained in stocks.
4043 2018-12-22 02:18:00 It is truly a nothing deal, very limited in scope and use and a token. Bump stocks are crazy inaccurate so it is symbolic
4044 2018-12-22 02:17:13 Can u recall the last time that your credit model diverged so much from stocks? Near the highs?
4045 2018-12-22 02:16:59 Your reckless governance has cost billions just this week.  Stocks down  7%!  Shame!
4046 2018-12-22 02:16:41 It's a cliche, but I hope you'll invest in penny stocks to cure your autism
4047 2018-12-22 02:16:35 Finished weekly investment tally, quite negative for week, but $AEP held up better  then most stocks and Bitcoin up on the week, but with Government shutdown looming, likely more trouble for markets XMAS week.
4048 2018-12-22 02:16:24 They liquidated their stocks Nov 29. #FTW
4049 2018-12-22 02:16:16 Bump stocks being banned is a huge step in the right direction, happy about literally any victory at this point
4050 2018-12-22 02:16:07 Me? I'll occupy Wall Street like the protest just to discuss interest rates and inflation
Not stocks and bonds, but
Contusions and knots, fractions and blood coagulation
4051 2018-12-22 02:16:02 STOCKS LOSING, GOVT DOWN, MUELLER PROSECUTIONS, NO WALL, NOKO STOCK PILING, STAFF QUITING .... AND A PARTRIDGE IN A BARE TREE

Ye jo stocks ki mandi hay

4053 2018-12-22 02:15:00 Since you asked, we did get bump stocks banned. He didn’t have anything to do with it. He’s still disgusting.
4054 2018-12-22 02:14:31 What asset will bring us the next bubble?

1) #Crypto, as useful #DAps join the #Blockchain

2) #Gold, in response to helicopter money

3) #AI, in anticipation of the singularity

4055 2018-12-22 02:14:17 I am not sure if Sage knows any but I know many Vets that supports Kaepernick and would take a knee with him. These same Vets also support banning AR15's and bump stocks. And support this Vet's right to start a gofundme page for...
4056 2018-12-22 02:13:36 Yes.. many times it’s the opposite  .. when stocks are down people don’t even open their portfolio
4057 2018-12-22 02:13:32 I predict similar numbers of bump stocks to be turned in in March
4058 2018-12-22 02:13:25 And the stocks tumbled more yikes. #JuanBieInvadesLaUnion
4059 2018-12-22 02:13:09 I see many good charts on the better gold stocks.
4060 2018-12-22 02:12:50 How much profit will you make this year, NO! Don’t tell me, let me guess. No I’m not being a wise guy. You don’t lose unless you sell. I only sell if I make a profit. The stocks I own will get through this correction and I will profit. There is No Bear - believe me.
4061 2018-12-22 02:12:40 The Russell 2000 (small cap stocks) has now lost all gains since the week of Trump's election and is down almost 5% since Trump took office.

Trade wars are good and easy to win.
4062 2018-12-22 02:12:38 Has anyone noticed that since the Dems won the House that their stocks have tanked? #realDonaldTrump #TuckerCarlsonTonight @seanhannity @LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump
4063 2018-12-22 02:10:52 @realDonaldTrump you always tweet vehemently about stocks.... why are you so quiet today?
4064 2018-12-22 02:10:06 Go Mark. I have same thought about 2 months ago. Sold 20% of stocks (even took some losses) and hold cash. I shall wait thru mid 2020 to go back it.
4065 2018-12-22 02:09:57 The stock market averages overweight certain stocks to make the market look better on the way up attracting more buyers but it also makes the averages look worse on the way down attracting more sellers
4066 2018-12-22 02:08:35 I agree totally not to listen to advice of people on CNBC.  But Ford crashed pretty hard last financial crisis.  I'm sure it will again.  I would like to buy stocks for long term hold maybe in one or two years from now.
4067 2018-12-22 02:08:30 You forgot worst December for stocks since Great Depression in 30s
4068 2018-12-22 02:07:44 Last night I offered to take five people to lunch at McDonald's when I sell my stocks.  I retract that today and would like to adjust that  number down to "3" (remember...dollar menu only!).
4069 2018-12-22 02:06:49 I’m comfortable buying at these levels, and stocks to run to new highs with reckless abandon. I’ve been good this year.
4070 2018-12-22 02:05:52 I could see that, like melting down. Seems like computer algo is doing it so people doesn't panic and bagholding stocks instead of throwing a towel.
4071 2018-12-22 02:05:05 If you’re heavily invested in stocks, it might make you feel better to check the “cost basis summary” of your investments.  

While overall, I’m down over $6,000, compared to my contributions, I’m only down a little over $2,500.

Much less scary 
4072 2018-12-22 02:04:37 I think I need to take a short break from Smash. I spent 10 hrs on Classic Mode. 22 hrs on World of Light. Hade a very intense first to 3 that went 5 fights x 3 stocks. #SmashBros
4073 2018-12-22 02:03:01 @TaketheProfit @trjck Additonally, the insiders are buying right now. They also bought heavily in August 2011, when stocks were slammed.
4074 2018-12-22 02:02:35 Let’s see oil is down, companies are buying back stocks & they received tax breaks from @realDonaldTrump he just announced we are pulling out of   and Syria! 17 years in  and the market doesn’t like it?? The 1% & the WAR MACHINE don’t like it! #NoMoreWar #WakeUpAmerica
4075 2018-12-22 02:02:27 Worst week for stocks since *before* Obama took office, government closing at midnight, unadvisedly withdrew from Syria, gifts to Russia, skyrocketing deficits, interest rates, plans to cut Social Security & Medicare. Corruption & collusion. 

Why are you supposedly so good?????
4076 2018-12-22 02:01:50 If we have a recession in 2019...How bad will it be compared to the “Financial Crisis” of 2007-2009?

4077 2018-12-22 02:01:45 I mentioned IMPRESSIONS, sky rocketing like STOCKS? In 24 hours reached approximately 3,000-when I wasn't truly interested in following 'politics' HUGELY, I guess I was boring? SINCE 12/2016 & I reiterate, @realDonaldTrump who literally SAVED MY LIFE...I am adamant about support.
4078 2018-12-22 02:01:43 Ramp - It's not coming from short sellers. Know how we can tell? For the entire month there has been no cover.  Likely that someone or some "them" w/ a very large derivatives book is getting margin calls. Liquidating stocks to raise cash is my bet. DB maybe ? But WTF do I know...
4079 2018-12-22 02:01:43 I’m about to learn how to play stocks
4080 2018-12-22 02:00:44 My company underpays us & then inflates our salary with restricted stock units that vest every few months. They’re golden handcuffs to ensure we stay & I have to cash them every time they vest so that I can afford to live. I technically “have stocks” but it’s not a boon. 
4081 2018-12-22 02:00:38 Major corporations cut jobs after getting their gov handouts. Just as they did in 2005 when W did this same exact thing. They did buy back their own stocks to inflate their stock prices.
4082 2018-12-22 01:59:37 IF YOU HAVE A 401K, 403B, & 457, IRA, STOCKS, MUTUAL FUNDS, & etc. 

HOW IS YOUR ACCOUNT LOOKING?
4083 2018-12-22 01:59:16 Please. Stocks blow right now.
4084 2018-12-22 01:58:50 (assuming you are 'holding' good stocks)
4085 2018-12-22 01:58:36 Stocks are no barometer for the economy however when the economy finally tanks it always takes the stock market down with it. Correlation is not always equal to causation
4086 2018-12-22 01:58:32 Sorry, this is dumb. We are not under attack by Mexico. They're not capable of changing our laws or way of life. They will never impact the day to day running of our Gov't. Trump will. So maybe we build walls around him so he no longer can compromise strategic operations & stocks
4087 2018-12-22 01:58:29 'hold' in the current environment is better. Too much uncertainty. I'm not much of a technical analysis guy, but I don't see signs of a bottom in anything other than emerging markets and chip stocks.
4088 2018-12-22 01:58:26 They stocks about to go thru the roof lol I'm getting me some lol
4089 2018-12-22 01:56:48 US Stocks Down. Hi trump Base remember when trump said.  With us goes up and with them it goes down. And this is worst week for stock market in decade. Trump it is going down way down. So there trump Base
4090 2018-12-22 01:56:23 Worst week in stocks since the last republican fucked up the economy #TrumpSlump #TrumpResign @realDonaldTrump
4091 2018-12-22 01:55:59 I want my kids around me to know what I wish i knew now, EARLY EARLY ...saving,stocks,law,backstabbing,the blindside of shit  etc etc 
4092 2018-12-22 01:55:54 I have safe stocks 
4093 2018-12-22 01:55:40 Well, if they’ve been thinking of stocks as ‘savings’ they better buckle up. Time some education. The hard way.
4094 2018-12-22 01:55:12 Thanks for your many links. I will look at them, because I've lived seven years in Sweden and remain interested in it and its neighbors.
My criticism will probably be that Scandinavia utilized free world trade to become wealthy and buying stocks and bonds doesn't make you liable.

4105 2018-12-22 01:50:00 Stocks Suffer Worst Week in a Decade
4106 2018-12-22 01:49:46 This political climate got trump & gop legalizing hemp & outlawing bump stocks & the dnc mad we aren't at war in Syria anymore 
4107 2018-12-22 01:48:54 Yeah they are getting the final stocks of Bandai's line! Actually its weird they are getting Japanese stuff too, Kamen RIder is up for pre-order 
4108 2018-12-22 01:47:46 From #NYTimes late today: “Stocks fell sharply again.. Tech-heavy #Nasdaq down over 20% from its peak, entering a #BearMarket, an ominous milestone.. #Russell2000 index.. entered a bear market earlier this week.. S&P 500’s energy stocks down 28% from their highs this year.”
4109 2018-12-22 01:47:29 ~ If I had a 401k, I would try my best to not invest in stocks, but to invest in your own states "Muni-Bond" funds. ~
4110 2018-12-22 01:45:05 Stock market down perfect time to rack up on dividend stocks 
4111 2018-12-22 01:44:32 To the people in #SmashBrosUltimate who gave their preferred rules set to 2 stocks... stop it. You’re only hurting yourself.
4112 2018-12-22 01:44:04 Ha! I can think of more bullish signs than fast falling stocks...
4113 2018-12-22 01:43:58 This market is absolutely brutal, but now is the time to buy. So many stocks are on sale.
4114 2018-12-22 01:43:12 If Morgan Stanley is found to be buying positions in lithium stocks at the same time that they are putting out this anti-lithium trash wouldn’t that be illegal in a sane world?
4115 2018-12-22 01:42:41 Bump stocks?
4116 2018-12-22 01:42:41 #Squirrel !!!! I feel like I have the attention span of a dog in this market. There’s so much I want to buy. When I think I lock in, I’m running to 5 other stocks! I gotta focus! #stockmarket #investing #WallStreet
4117 2018-12-22 01:41:26 .@realDonaldTrump FED didn't raise rates for entire Presidency of 8 yrs of Obama! With u, Stocks up 15% 4 increases!
4118 2018-12-22 01:41:24 Stocks down nearly 7% this week.  You are the cause.  Shame!
4119 2018-12-22 01:41:05 Trump is shitting all over us. Guess you haven't noticed. Name anything that's going well. Foreign policy disaster. Stocks in free fall. President completely unhinged, top general quits in absolute disgust. This is MAGA & winning? Exactly what I expected. 
4120 2018-12-22 01:39:23 I can't stand him, but us pulling out, banning bump stocks and prison reform is the right thing to do and people need to stop w the bullshit
4121 2018-12-22 01:38:42 I don't buy that, Doug. Cabinet members have been leaving since the very beginning of this administration and stocks SOARED. The cause of this tanking is purely economic/liquidity driven.
4122 2018-12-22 01:38:38 I think online matchmaking needs to be changed in a way that stock, time, battlefield or omega are the things that could possibly be different instead of someone who has 1v1 3 stocks 7 minutes doing a FFA with items that lowers their gsp
4123 2018-12-22 01:38:19 The failing wall push, Syria withdrawal pushback, more resignations, a shutdown, worst stocks month since 1931... when @realDonaldTrump is in this bad a spot and STILL the @GOP plays along, it shows you how deeply warped the party has become. #TrumpResign
#GovernmentShutdown
4124 2018-12-22 01:37:49 Trump has repeatedly pointed to market gains as that his economic policies are working and that the country. Unless an end-of-year rally emerges, 2018 will be the worst year for U.S. stocks since 2008 and the S&P 500 on track for its worst December since the Great Depression.
4125 2018-12-22 01:37:19 as soon as the democrats start talking their crap, the stocks start falling!
4126 2018-12-22 01:36:43 powell and trade war beating tech stocks that led most of the rally
4127 2018-12-22 01:36:22 What a load of crap! We don't believe in your scare tactics. For 8 years, you told us Obama was taking our guns away, which was a lie to get people to buy more guns. Do you own stock in gun companies? The only one banning guns is Trump. This week, he banned bumb stocks.
4128 2018-12-22 01:36:11 The Trump administration officially banned bump stocks. Trump took your money but stabbed you in the back. You didn’t complain and aren’t taking actions about it. Yet, you want to attack a potential presidential candidate while the guy in charge just gave you the middle finger.
4129 2018-12-22 01:34:24 Investor mentality, Gold is up...buy gold. Market is down, sell out...buy gold. Gold falls...sell gold and buy stocks as going up. This is how most people trade.....dumb as a house brick.
4130 2018-12-22 01:34:16 Yes, and we have a distributor that stocks pop with the one legged one and she keeps threatening to kick him in his bum leg and steal it for me 
4131 2018-12-22 01:33:57 Why is it "the base" a clear minority in this nation is able to set all executive policies??   Stocks are n a free fall.. HELLO!!
4132 2018-12-22 01:33:54 You can make it in Google Sheets. The formula =GOOGLEFINANCE("ticket","price") will give you the current market price per share. If you use TD Ameritrade, you can also set up specific alerts for when stocks cross through key prices.
4133 2018-12-22 01:32:06 In 2019 we arent calling them “3 stocks,” we calling them “epic pownages”
4134 2018-12-22 01:32:01 2019 will be a great year for gold and silver and horrible for stocks
4135 2018-12-22 01:30:03 down our stocks, 
 And think your deeds, in them a son of heaven, 
 Be here with sleep; 
 And as it please the day hath made her

4137 2018-12-22 01:29:31 2019 could turn out to be a great year for stocks.
4138 2018-12-22 01:29:20 Stocks finna drop soon, next two months prolly a good time to buy.

4140 2018-12-22 01:29:11 Pmis collapsed.  That wasnt tech.  The whole economy went down.  The tech collapse more stocks/wealth effect.
4141 2018-12-22 01:29:06 NRA should have fault for bump stocks....
4142 2018-12-22 01:28:41 What is “semi” and which Chinese stocks?
4143 2018-12-22 01:28:30 US stocks suffered one of the worst weekly falls in a decade as trade tensions with China, interest rate rises and a possible government shutdown rattled markets.
4144 2018-12-22 01:28:18 Not giving such massive incentives to buy back stocks all at once.
Tax break: BUY BACK ALL STOCKS SO PORTFOLIO LOOKS GOOD
Tariff: BUY BACK ALL STOCKS TO ESTABLISH SECURITY!
Regulation repeal: BUY BACK ALL STOCKS BEFORE INEVITABLE LAW SUITS AND BAIL!

Gosh, I'm seeing a pattern.
4145 2018-12-22 01:27:51 @POTUS is the grinch in 2018. Stocks at at a 10 year low, and government workers' pay checks hanging in the balance, allies about to be slaughtered in Syria. Looks like he stole Christmas from a lot of people. #allforself
4146 2018-12-22 01:27:24 Whether it's getting us out of wars, criminal justice reform, banning bump stocks, etc., even the left is #winning with @realDonaldTrump... but #OrangeManBad.
4147 2018-12-22 01:27:24 stocks flat for 20 years. Bull runs only on zero % interest rates & high debt, followed by crashes. Latest bull run due to -ve rates, money/debt creation but ending. Asset prices insane; 20% housing fall would still leave housing unaffordable @ normal rates. Bubble everything
4148 2018-12-22 01:27:23 #stocks tank. Thanks @gop
4149 2018-12-22 01:27:18 That’s a start, but stocks don’t find a floor until they officially say all hikes off the table for 2019 ... all these conditionals the market has thrown up on so far, and yet Fed doesn’t learn lesson market desperate for some certainty, once and for all.
4150 2018-12-22 01:27:09 Their military stocks are losing money now.  War makes them rich.
4151 2018-12-22 01:26:43 My stocks been taking a beating!

4155 2018-12-22 01:26:08 Well that too. But stocks don’t matter as much. Not the first dip
4156 2018-12-22 01:26:07 Doing any tax loss harvesting?

We sold some remaining $SPY that was in the red in exchange for some high conviction stocks. 

Those tax breaks really add up.

4158 2018-12-22 01:24:48 $spy $spx This doesn't look like just a small pull back.  Stocks are overvalued.  Total Market Cap is still 124% of GDP, was 140% just a few months ago.  Last time it was that overvalued was the 2000 tech bubble.  Wait and buy the real dip.

4161 2018-12-22 01:23:37 Consider this: What if the Federal Reserve could actually do something that is identical to "Black Friday" and that something is making stock prices cheap? My advice, don't sell your stocks,  buy stocks when people are selling them at a discount. Be wise In what you buy.

4173 2018-12-22 01:17:47 We already knew Democrats were not going to vote to hand over more BILLIONS to Trump. The republican COWARDS came back to give Trump his WALL, now they are gone to celebrate the Holidays with their families. How about the 800,00 Federal workers? STOCKS ARE PLUMMETING, 401 k’s?
4174 2018-12-22 01:17:45 You joke, but Off-White Sneakers have been a better investment than the majority of stocks this year.
4175 2018-12-22 01:17:05 Sadly, all activities remain sparse & fragmented, with little supporting integrative policy or vital domestic knowledge base.

The Fishery Ministery lacks crucial up-to-date information about the country's stocks. All that's available are an old poster & whimsical data. Weep!
4176 2018-12-22 01:16:26 What are u talking about bump stocks, this artical is evidentiary that media is fake to the extent their only objective is to slander the president, even if it means contradicting artical they previously wrote.. Media = Trump bad no matter what.
4177 2018-12-22 01:15:35 Fewer than 1% of stocks would ever be on my radar.
4178 2018-12-22 01:15:31 NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT!!! And YES he can and has messed up in some ways, I am not blind to that at all.

As an FYI - I will buy if goes down, I'll hold at these levels, I will sell v lightly (AND NOT BUY) if it goes up, that is my strategy for all my stocks, this is no exception.
4179 2018-12-22 01:15:14 think of all the money you save on towels! you can use that for stocks!

4182 2018-12-22 01:14:08 Oh— after this week in the Stock Market, the worst since 1931 and worse crash since 1987, it is Republicans who will need funding, because those defense stocks you bought instead of giving our military a raise are crashing, too! Hope your bank accounts crumbled.
4183 2018-12-22 01:13:57 Bro i been this way i was doing stocks in high school
4184 2018-12-22 01:13:24 Ever wonder when stocks plummet @realDonaldTrump doesn’t take responsibility.. he’s scum like that
4185 2018-12-22 01:13:18 It's still possible to use the end of year as a time to buy stocks on sale, but you have to put in more and more effort (as the years go by) to identify the ones which will drop and then go back up. Enough people have caught on that the arbitrage opportunity here is slim.
4186 2018-12-22 01:12:09 Because buying those stocks increased the demand again, and it made it more difficult to distinguish the ones which were "on sale" from the ones which were genuinely decreasing in fundamental value (and would stay that way).
4187 2018-12-22 01:12:03 Wow  US stocks are in a slump and the Secretary of Defense is being replaced so the POTUS should resign!!! WTH were you when Obama was in office!?!?  Economy was worst ever and he went through 3 or 4 SOD...craziness!
4188 2018-12-22 01:11:29 If I could offer one piece of advice to you on retirement, buy some stocks at this level.
4189 2018-12-22 01:11:28 Im on my stocks every 2 days checking

4195 2018-12-22 01:10:29 Anyway, here's the really cool part: people picked up on the fact that end-of-year was essentially a sale, because most of the stocks would go back up a month or so later (wash sale rule, etc). So they started buying... which promptly eliminated the arbitrage opportunity
4196 2018-12-22 01:10:26 WOWOWOWOWO

The worst December for stocks since 1931, if things don't change.

4198 2018-12-22 01:08:53 Wait a minute, "most Americans" don't even own stocks so referencing a depletion of "savings" due to market turmoil in 2018 isn't at all accurate.
Americans who depended upon returns from bank deposit rates have been decimated since 2008.
4199 2018-12-22 01:06:51 Trump under investigation on multiple fronts.

People fleeing jobs in his administration.

Getting criticism on Fox for his impetuous military decisions.

Stocks tanking.

I’d gloat but the times feel too damn dangerous to be smug.
4200 2018-12-22 01:06:23 I still have no idea what you are bitching about. But if you want to get under my skin, you will have to try a lot harder. Listen. Go relax. Take a bath. Go watch your stocks crash.
4201 2018-12-22 01:06:06 I agree but the pain in base&EV metals/oil stocks will get much worse before it gets better
$CRB chart is quite clear on this.
Never know a case when MMs let investors go before taking their pound of flesh, just my 2c.
4202 2018-12-22 01:05:53 Worst stock market week in a decade. So much winning, eh @realDonaldTrump #FridayThoughts #stocks #RetirementPlanning 
4203 2018-12-22 01:05:44 Not as wrong as you think, the MSM brainwashes people into thinking that yet let's see stocks up, jobs up, national security up, taxes lower. The left has done nothing but bitch, moan, put us in debt and worried about PC nonsense that's trivial over priorities that help the USA
4204 2018-12-22 01:05:32 Holy shit Facebook's stocks are dropping like crazy
4205 2018-12-22 01:04:03 There have been a lot of stocks that have fallen precipitously in the last few weeks, in many sectors.
4206 2018-12-22 01:03:45 With EA, Blizzard, Take 2 interactive and other triple A game publisher stocks plumitting, i'm sure there will be.
4207 2018-12-22 01:03:40 Stocks down by 400+ points? Gov’t shutdown around the corner? Can’t tell me we aren’t going into another recession.
4208 2018-12-22 01:03:25 I do both. Bulk of it through my 401k, but I love the OTCBB and invest in several penny stocks. It’s my get rich quick scheme that hasn’t gotten me rich yet, but I do ok 
4209 2018-12-22 01:03:21 cês dois juntos não aguentam 7 minutos 3 stocks com a minha corrin
4210 2018-12-22 01:03:16 It's the best time to invest, so yes. Stocks are on sale, buy more on the dips if possible.
4211 2018-12-22 01:02:46 No. U hated on the man in office who finally got bump stocks banned, cuz MSM &ur ignorant upbringing prob taught u Dems r far better than Reps, when majority country issues aren't Right or Left measurable. But Trump is 1st president to go against backers (NRA) &do this-RESPECT
4212 2018-12-22 01:02:41 Not sure if u lost any money in your stocks this month, but i lost about 30 racks this month. Thanks trump for the greatest tax break
4213 2018-12-22 01:00:41 @TaketheProfit Dollar cost averaging is not buy high. It's a great strategy in market corrections. Stocks are on sale.
4214 2018-12-22 00:59:45 CNBC has been discussing the causes and effects of a correction in the averages and bear market in individual stocks and groups. What else would we be talking about? And economic policy. Steve Liesman did an outstanding, exclusive, interview with NY Fed President, John Williams.
4215 2018-12-22 00:59:43 Does NASDAQ & Tech stocks in India co-relate?
4216 2018-12-22 00:59:29 December 2018 will be the worst December for stocks since 1931. But you know what?

"Trade wars are good and easy to win".

 - The guy who took multiple companies into bankruptcy and is forcing the federal government into shutdown.
4217 2018-12-22 00:59:24 Wow, you need a reality check! This is the worst December in stocks and economy since the 1929 Great Depression. #RealityChecksAreFree
4218 2018-12-22 00:59:12 The fed has seen a little preview of what QE has done.  Businesses are complaining of labor shortage, more QE won't help with that.  Ironically, now that the gamblers can't make money in stocks now, the labor participation rate should go up.
4219 2018-12-22 00:59:09 So are bump stocks legal again at midnight?
4220 2018-12-22 00:59:00 That sounds like the same technique I am applying to investing in Bitcoin right now.  I can’t time the peaks and valley of the bitcoin price but it has shown remarkable returns for the past 9 years.  

Best performing asset compare to stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.
4221 2018-12-22 00:58:29 Several years (decades) ago, people realized that stocks went down at the end of the year, and recovered in the new year. There were some theories developed about this, but it ended up being pretty straightforward: large stock sales to optimize taxes.
4222 2018-12-22 00:58:08 -Trump wants troops out of Syria
-Gen. Mattis quits
-Stocks = worst December since Great Depression
-Worst week of performance since financial crisis in 2008
-3rd shutdown in a year because he is throwing a tantrum about no wall & not getting $5B for it. It’s clear. #TrumpResign
4223 2018-12-22 00:57:45 The problem with stocks is that there are imperfect people masking decisions with the news the fake news is giving them. We are in a dynamic economy that can change on a rumor.
4224 2018-12-22 00:57:39 This is random but it’s on my mind. I’ve realized regardless of what Trump does it receives heavy criticism, opposition, or pure silence. He’s essentially governed as a liberal with the prison reform, tariffs, the farm bill, bump stocks, troops withdraw etc etc etc
4225 2018-12-22 00:57:19 This correction is a cake walk compared to 2008-2009. Back then, stock market down over 50% peak to trough and people were losing homes. Maybe you shouldn’t own stocks if you can’t handle perfectly normal market dip.
4226 2018-12-22 00:57:14 Y’all looking for Christmas sales? Shit, buy some stocks while they still on sale...
4227 2018-12-22 00:56:59 Sell your stocks people, the markets gonna crash
4228 2018-12-22 00:56:49 Trump just made hemp legal and bump stocks illegal in the United States and if any other guy did that, Liberals would call them the greatest President of all-time.
4229 2018-12-22 00:56:41 Appently Russia is not telling the truth......this times it’s about wheat stocks.  Why, why, why do we trust a single word of theirs?!?!?!?  They play our traders  like cheap fiddles.....just saying......
4230 2018-12-22 00:56:16 Of course #stocks finally are "tanking."
For years, stocks - soaring while incomes near-flat, high percent of currently working incomes nil - have been a bubble.
Exact same pattern housing bubble had.
4231 2018-12-22 00:55:53 Playstation portable on top of a Sofa! WHILE STOCKS LAST!
4232 2018-12-22 00:55:38 Actually they are. Inflation according to the fed is 2% wages are rising at 2.7% the GDP is growing at 3.5% and bouncing with 4%.

Stocks are not an indication of the economy and they will go back up.
4233 2018-12-22 00:55:33 If pattern of US generating mostly financial spillovers and  China mostly generating real ones still hold than a world that sees reconvergence via US slowing & marginal fiscal impulse in US declining but rising in EZ and CN, that’s awesome for all stocks but especially RoW ones.
4234 2018-12-22 00:54:39 'Twas the week b-fore Christmas and all through the colocated server facilities in Mahwah, the not un-elvelike robots were quietly bidding stocks up while you were too busy doing things that matter, to give you just enough hope to buy in the bright New Year then, BAM!! smackdown
4235 2018-12-22 00:53:51 Wages are not meeting the rise of inflation, and the stocks just ranked. Being employed but still not having enough money to invest in your family and future is worthless.
4236 2018-12-22 00:52:11 We don’t vaccinate for smallpox as it doesn’t exist in the wild anymore. That said, the CDC among others has stocks of vaccine in case it gets released.
4237 2018-12-22 00:51:06 If anyone hasn’t noticed, US stocks have just experienced their worst week since 2008 and have had over 16 months worth of gains wiped out. There’s talk of a bear market now amongst commentators. Trump arrogantly overassumed US economic strength in waging a trade wars with China
4238 2018-12-22 00:50:33 I don’t think mom and pop dumping their stocks care about China easing
4239 2018-12-22 00:50:19 This government shut down fucking up my stocks fr 
4240 2018-12-22 00:50:13 I'm a trader, I follow the markets every day. It's only bad for the people who bought stocks which were already up 100s and sometimes 1000s of percent. It's like buying any good when supply is high, and then being shocked and upset when the product goes on sale.
4241 2018-12-22 00:50:09 woooooohoooo!
4242 2018-12-22 00:50:07 The last 2 times stocks fell this far, we needed a Fed rescue to stop it.  If that’s ok with you this time then I guess that’s bullish.
4243 2018-12-22 00:49:35 US stocks suffered one of the worst weekly falls in a decade as trade tensions with China, interest rate rises and a possible government shutdown rattled markets.
4244 2018-12-22 00:49:15 US stocks suffer worst week in a decade. Pay attention to what matters.
4245 2018-12-22 00:49:04 I just read an article that said “low oil prices” are part of the reason for the stock market tanking... really???? Since when does less cost for heating anyones house during the winter make them sell any stocks they may have?????
4246 2018-12-22 00:48:53 Robinhood is just an app to trade. Like etrade. I have some stocks with them too. Wells Fargo is my bank
4247 2018-12-22 00:47:13 US stocks suffered one of the worst weekly falls in a decade #btc #btcoin #crypto #shhh
4248 2018-12-22 00:45:53 @marcorubio @senatemajldr @HouseGOP @latimes Congratulations Republicans! Soon we will lose our country to Russia and your stocks will be worthless
4249 2018-12-22 00:45:32 Markets are the greatest discounting mechanism of the future we hominids have. Stocks are telling us something. Yet he is recklessly spending on frivolous things society will be paying for for years. Who are "my right wing conservatives in the US"? Are they my friends? My dad?
4250 2018-12-22 00:45:28 Interested as well.
4251 2018-12-22 00:45:07 So are we not going to talk about how bump stocks were banned 3 days ago? I haven’t seen anything about this.
4252 2018-12-22 00:45:05 US stocks suffer worst week in a decade

That means it wasn’t the worst during Obama’s presidency, it is THE WORST DURING TRUMPS ADMIN

Sucks to be the MAGAman this week!
4253 2018-12-22 00:43:49 Sounds about right, knowing when to throw out aerials, and getting the crucial f smashes to finish out stocks early takes an understanding of neutral and decisive execution. He feels a lot quicker and extremely powerful, and I feel like I have pretty good fundamentals with him
4254 2018-12-22 00:43:08 Let’s see oil is down, companies are buying back stocks & they received tax breaks from @realDonaldTrump he just announced we are pulling out of   and Syria! 17 years in  and the market doesn’t like it?? The 1% & the WAR MACHINE don’t like it! #NoMoreWar #WakeUpAmerica
4255 2018-12-22 00:42:10 @LowercaseCapital $SPY Absolutely, we have traded several stocks (going long) for good percentage gains since correction started in October.
4256 2018-12-22 00:42:10 Investment advice. Tax season is around the corner. With a government shut down. Invest before you spend.  #stocks & #bonds
4257 2018-12-22 00:40:25 #NASDAQ in bear territory you say? Stocks having the worst December since the GREAT DEPRESSION you say? Reasons, who cares, too many and not enough characters, but a few come to mind. #tradewar overspending, #NationalDebt, uncertainty etc etc etc. #ThanksTrump
4258 2018-12-22 00:39:54 US stocks suffered one of the worst weekly falls in a decade as trade tensions with China, interest rate rises and a possible government shutdown rattled markets.
It is the biggest weekly drop since August 2011 while the Nasdaq's 8.36% decline is the sharpest since November 2008
4259 2018-12-22 00:39:17 BUY STOCKS IN WEREWOLF FUCK!!!
4260 2018-12-22 00:39:05 EA stocks being down $21 billion makes me happy.
4261 2018-12-22 00:38:10 oh my parents money :)” 
*bitcoin stocks go down* 
me:
4262 2018-12-22 00:38:02 Yes business and all 401k fundholders forced into the market in order to save for retirement tax-free. If the market doesn't regain value soon, then we'll be better off investing in real estate rather than the stock market and a generation will avoid stocks.
4263 2018-12-22 00:37:47 This years Scrooge Award should go to @generalelectric  for their godforsaken C6 outdoor Christmas lights.....that NOBODY stocks replacement bulbs for....none in package
4264 2018-12-22 00:37:39 “It is insanity to raise interest rates when stocks are already crashing, but the Federal Reserve did it anyway.”
The stock market isn’t being destroyed by President Trump, it’s being destroyed be the federal reserve board!
4265 2018-12-22 00:37:35 Stocks down since Trump’s tax law took effect. S&P500 down 2 points since 1/20/2017.
4266 2018-12-22 00:36:19 FU, Donnie boy. Your tantrum has shut down the government (again). Stocks are plunging, by the way. This is a sign you won't be reelected. Worst president of the US.
4267 2018-12-22 00:36:06 Wipe out our 401K ,and stocks and will be begging for a guaranteed minimum income,those dirty globalist will be happy when middle America is on its knees.
4268 2018-12-22 00:35:55 Next they’ll be wanting to ban firearm furniture like bump stocks.. oh wait, that’s right.. with help from the NRA none the less.
4269 2018-12-22 00:35:53 Who in the twitter-verse knows something about investing and stocks???
4270 2018-12-22 00:35:51 @LaymenGaming  cmooooon guys. Daddy Yong already uploaded the "EA loses $21 billion in stocks" video, but i wanna see YOUR take on the matter. and what better way to celebrate the holidays, than talking about EA losing money <3
4271 2018-12-22 00:35:47 Man, stocks just getting hammered. I’m most sad about my Nvidia investment.
4272 2018-12-22 00:35:25 3 stocks 3 min lets go
4273 2018-12-22 00:35:19 Today was a good day :-)! Good job!
4274 2018-12-22 00:35:16 Stocks so low you can’t even sell. You just gotta hold and wait for better days smh
4275 2018-12-22 00:35:13 .Bear markets in stocks are rare but have the power to spread gloom through the economy. In the last 20 years, there have been only two — one that began with the financial crisis in 2007, and the other that started with the dot-com bust in 2000. @nytimes
4276 2018-12-22 00:34:32 yo someone explain to me what’s going on w the gov’t rn I just hear the words “government shutdown” & I don’t really know what that entails but I know my stocks are too low & I need them back up that’s my vacation fund y’all I need a “government for dummies” book I’m concerned
4277 2018-12-22 00:34:24 No, America's worst nightmare is being constantly thrown into illegal wars that ARE NOT approved by Congress!!! Sorry about your plummeting stocks in Raytheon, Halliburton and Bowing Mr Graham!!!
4278 2018-12-22 00:34:14 Actually that's true, especially if you've missed most of the drop already. The big boys are just waiting for everyone to panic and start selling, and they scoop up the stocks at bargain prices. If you don't need to retire next year, #LetItRide.
4279 2018-12-22 00:33:41 The news may indeed be bad in coming months. So many stocks down 40%+ reflects this possible outcome that’s for sure.
4280 2018-12-22 00:33:20 You may settle your payment until we still have stocks left. 
4281 2018-12-22 00:32:52 do not sell your stocks 
do not sell your stocks
do not sell your stocks 
do not sell your stocks 
do not sell your stocks
do not sell your stocks 
do not sell your stocks
4282 2018-12-22 00:32:50 Stocks on track for the worst December since 1931, the great depression. #GOPShutDown Tax Scam.
4283 2018-12-22 00:32:50 Are they the ones they will send to take Bump Stocks? Shame...I want  essential ones.
4284 2018-12-22 00:32:48 Privately? The administration doesn't do anything privately ... one boob is dumping stocks, on the phone, on the WH lawn ... Broidy seems to take of family planning for lady friends of the RNC ... I wish they would learn the meaning.
4285 2018-12-22 00:32:30 Hey Stocks-n-Crypto(@StocksNCrypto), thank you for following me
4286 2018-12-22 00:32:00 Thanks for responding. Obama care as all know we be more cost effective if all 50 states participated. Thus the GOP eliminated the mandate for all. Fact 
Corps instead of increasing wages & 401k match for employees overwhelmingly used proceeds from tax cuts 2 buy back stocks.
4287 2018-12-22 00:31:19 2019 Stocks: 6/6
$WSRA .0600 - Solid dip opportunity here after reaching nearly .16 a few weeks back. Remember, $GRPS has 12.5% ownership of all WSRA assets, making them a good tandem buy (imo). Expecting very strong alliance between the two and strong revenue results near term.
4288 2018-12-22 00:30:28 Pot stocks is the topic this year...
4289 2018-12-22 00:29:53 Shortest day of the year but you wouldn’t know it by looking at the stocks market
4290 2018-12-22 00:29:41 From a contact:  

12-21-18  $VIX still testing 30 – we would like to see a further spike, Feb’ Oil closer to $44 (or $39 – $40?) would also be a sign of bottoming in stocks. With Dow futures down about 600 points today, we are now just 400 points from the 
contd.
4291 2018-12-22 00:29:34 excuses to further bloat t/unaccountable budgets of t/pentagon & t/Raytheon,Boeing,Lockheed stocks (largely owned by our Senators), ah, and to appropriate natural resources there, namely earth minerals and OIL, OIL, OIL, slowly killing the earth and all of humanity (us as well)
4292 2018-12-22 00:29:27 Buy stocks not packs and we will bring them down from the "Inside". Stocks at $77 bundles Still $100,  just sayin....
4293 2018-12-22 00:28:27 #WinterSolstice - worst week for stocks since the #FinancialCrisis, worst month since the #GreatDepression. After the darkest week, it ends with a gov’t shutdown over an ineffectual wall. I am ready to return to the light. January 3 can’t come soon enough.
4294 2018-12-22 00:27:38 Stocks. Flows. So confusing!

I guess it's too much to expect for an enemy of capitalism to understand the concept of capital.
4295 2018-12-22 00:27:29 Most Americans don't own stocks. I really don't care, they don't either.
Maybe owning stocks in corporations isn't all it's cracked up to be.
4296 2018-12-22 00:27:12 @sisSoftware DO YOU HAVE A SYSTEM SET UP WHERE YOU CAN TRADE OPTIONS ON THE FANG STOCKS?
4297 2018-12-22 00:27:09 2019 Stocks: 5/6
$PYX Nonetheless, I think they stand a chance to be a real contender in the #cannabis industry. At this price, and especially lower if it gets there, I think this can make for a very nice gainer in time. #allmyopinion
4298 2018-12-22 00:27:03 Also. I do appreciate the advice even though it is at the same level of lameness as your ability to understand things. I’m going to continue to trade stocks- after all, new cars and family vacations don’t pay for themselves. $NHPI
4299 2018-12-22 00:26:46 Safety first? Some nerve you have spouting this when you have passed no serious federal gun laws to Keep Us Safer outside of bump stocks. #SandyHook @momsdemand Let’s do Universal Background Checks first & than we’ll talk! @shannonrwatts @senatemajldr
4300 2018-12-22 00:26:38 Is there any way you can invest in footballers like stocks? Could make some good money, seems pretty straight forward
4301 2018-12-22 00:26:37 NASDAQ in Bear market: Down 22 % from its 52 week high. stocks fell sharply in volatile trading on Friday, with the Nasdaq confirming it is in a bear market, as concerns of slowing economic growth..
4302 2018-12-22 00:26:22 BB stocks what do feel sentiments are strongly $EVSV long?
4303 2018-12-22 00:25:34 You mean the shutdown you said was YOUR shutdown? That one?
Stocks will now tank in what'll become known as the Trump Slump. Kudos, #DullardJChump
4304 2018-12-22 00:25:26 Stocks and shares are way over valued.  You cant have infinite growth on finite resources.  Something has to give, it may hurt my pension but a correction in stocks may start to bring prices down as no one has any money to spend
4305 2018-12-22 00:25:10 Seems slower growth or lowering of value in stocks is a correction. We know markets swing but this looks like we got twisted and could be stuck in a very lopsided landslide. Part of this is massive confusion over tariffs with no structure and predicting future legal cases.
4306 2018-12-22 00:25:02 I need learn how to read stocks 
4307 2018-12-22 00:24:58 US stocks suffer worst week in decade. Thanks.
4308 2018-12-22 00:24:52 Where is the story from our WH about the WORST week for stocks in a decade?? The illegitimate Pres. not pushing that story too much lately, it's all on trump stupidity!!
4309 2018-12-22 00:24:48 I like how they say "better hurry! Sale ends tomorrow at midnight" and then add " OR until stocks last!" All in all the sale will never end because issa scam sis
4310 2018-12-22 00:24:31 What is 911 print.  Been seeing this with NHPI
4311 2018-12-22 00:23:39 I thought #MexicoWillPayForTheWall why are we #ShutDownTheGovernment to pay for something @POTUS said we should not pay for before what has changed? #stocks have tanked and #grownups are fleeing this #PresidentTrump
4312 2018-12-22 00:23:38 Will have basket trade of 4-5 stocks ready to go long next week. Everything is just a trade. Probably 5% positions each. So still plenty cash.
4313 2018-12-22 00:23:07 "Stocks are on pace for the worst December since the Great Depression."
4314 2018-12-22 00:23:07 just invested $2 in what i am told are called “stocks”. am i an adult yet
4315 2018-12-22 00:23:00 Are stocks just the beta of finance?
4316 2018-12-22 00:22:49 Inflation is stable albeit at the lower end of the desired range, Aud falling good for commodities and other export industries. Yes price stability, currency and employment not stocks and house prices...
4317 2018-12-22 00:22:47 I’m saying stocks were overpriced and now it’s a great buying opportunity.  Thanks Donald!
4318 2018-12-22 00:22:28 Tell me why the man who stocks our supplies in our department made a homemade durag out the scrub caps. I repeat scrub caps like if that ain’t some ghetto shit 
4319 2018-12-22 00:22:17 - US stocks suffer worst week in a decade
- Government ready to shut down
- @scotus allows lower court injunction against asylum ban to stand

So much WINNING just in one day. Thanks to @realDonaldTrump #TrumpShutdown #TrumpResign
4320 2018-12-22 00:21:29 I still have fun when Tom dash dance grabs me nonstop on marth but then I gimp him with shine 1 of the 4 stocks. Makes my night sometimes.
4321 2018-12-22 00:19:10 Stocks have been tumbling, best indicator that shows somethings up with government
4322 2018-12-22 00:18:48 STAFF SPOTLIGHT:
*Harry Galvan* is our soft CFO and has been with us for 7 months. On holidays, he really, really likes trading stocks. #whoweare
4323 2018-12-22 00:18:47 So the stock market had the worst showing in 7 years, unsurprising considering it's been yo-yoing radically under Trump
@realdonaldTrump, since you posited that any day stocks went up was a reflection of your #MAGA agenda...
What'll you feed your #TrumpTrain now?

4324 2018-12-22 00:18:36 Penny Stocks, here they come! #pinksheet dustbin of history. Maybe Zuck can use his stock options as toilet paper in the federal #Supermax can?
4325 2018-12-22 00:17:37 NOT JUST STOCKS! A lot of people are watching their retirement slip away because of a compromised Republican wingnut that occupies the White House
4326 2018-12-22 00:17:03 To bad the Stocks don't reflect it.
4327 2018-12-22 00:16:35 Shannon read BBC news re US stocks and China. Perfect example of simple gauge theory but where next. Agree about schools. One size fits all. No such thing as bad pupils just poor teachers who cannot teach the highly talented to use their skill v average Joe just remember in exams
4328 2018-12-22 00:16:27 I haven’t looked at my stocks in 4-days and I am scared as hell to do so! The market has to bounce back next week or I’m lose my mind....
4329 2018-12-22 00:16:14 2019 Stocks: 1/6
$NHPI .0068 - Can possibly be one of the biggest movers OTC has seen in a long time.
$GRPS .0066 - despite pullback since yesterday, huge loading volume yesterday indicative of bigger run. $50M offering and product launches coming imo.

4330 2018-12-22 00:15:56 STOCK MARKET The Dow is on track for its worst week since the 2008 financial crisis, and its worst December since the Great Depression. After a rally this morning, stocks fell sharply this afternoon on fears that Pres. Trump will force a government shutdown over the border wall.
4331 2018-12-22 00:15:39 $DJI crashing, $BTC pumping. This week confirmed one thing: Bitcoin is an unrelated asset to the stocks market. So the global recession starting should have a little to no impact on #Bitcoin @APompliano

4334 2018-12-22 00:14:44 @wuxingsrcs I Hired a moving crew to move all the office desks a few inches to the left in one of your location. Will that affect the productivity of this single office or does that Feng Shui stuff works at a bigger scale? Anyways will keep an eye on your stocks. #Shadowrun
4335 2018-12-22 00:14:37 Just seeing on BBC that US stocks suffered their worst week in a decade this week.

4345 2018-12-22 00:12:12 @realDonaldTrump Mr President, I’m not a professional, so maybe we could talk. I’ve come to believe that a good policy rule of thumb might be, “If I want US stocks to go up, I don’t want to make decisions that cause US media to say, ‘Only Putin approves.’”
4346 2018-12-22 00:11:02 Maybe but why didn’t European stocks move on Draghi’s purchases?  More QE then us I think. Got to answer that.

4355 2018-12-22 00:08:15 .@JosephNSanberg Respectfully, I do not understand the obsession with the stock market, particularly from a Left perspective.  The stock market rarely paints an accurate picture of the economy.  The majority of stocks are owned by the rich. #TYTLive
4356 2018-12-22 00:08:14 Considering that stocks have just started there bear market and according to market cycle or history its likely to continue... Do you think that funds will shift to blockchain and crypto since its total market cap is around 130 billion... If not could we see a crypto crash....??
4357 2018-12-22 00:07:56 This is ridiculous. I have heard the matter covered on at least 3 occasions. There is no risk to medical supplies not getting in. Suppliers are not advising of any risks, larger stocks are being kept, & the Govt's backup would be to fly them in if it was necessary.

4364 2018-12-22 00:06:30 Stocks are for gamblers. If their money mattered to them, they would have bought bonds.
4365 2018-12-22 00:06:27 Are we there yet? Just as it seemed the market would never stop grinding higher, now it seems there is no end in sight to a bottom. One thing to note: each stock is not the market and should be treated on its own merits. A lot of stocks I’m watching are actually well above lows.
4366 2018-12-22 00:06:13 Always lots of negative opinions after stocks drop.

4368 2018-12-22 00:05:38 Trump is trolling the US so hard rn. Guy legalizes CBD farming and liberals are silent. Guy bans bump-stocks, and gun dicks love him way too much to say anything.
4369 2018-12-22 00:05:26 Good things this week:

- SCOTUS rejects POTUS' asylum ban
- POTUS to pull troops out of illegally occupied Syria
- AG bans bump stocks
- RBG's broken ribs put spotlight on lungs

Search for smoke-and-mirrors, yes. But don't be fooled into thinking there aren't positives here.

4382 2018-12-22 00:00:45 Sir, I am a Proud Ammo-Sexual and an NRA member, but even I can say the NRA caved in on this one. Bump-Stocks were thrown under the bus to save face and there is no pushback from the NRA. GOA, FPC and a couple others are taking legal action. Is the NRA?

4439 2018-12-21 23:49:28 @TeamCavuto The ABSOLUTE GREATEST BEARER OF BAD BAD NEWS!!! He just had someone on last night saying nothing to worry about! Stocks are finding their level! But Cavuto can’t stand that news for Trump! Screw you Cavuto! Of course this happens in trade wars stupid!!!

4442 2018-12-21 23:48:33 Look at the stocks going down, then look at your government......because everything and your 401k is going Down.   But trump is a good president. . F.O.H.  Your messing with our retirement.
4443 2018-12-21 23:47:42 A TV is a depreciating asset that doesn't change form over time.

A market index is constantly changing to own only the stocks that meet its criteria.

Dollar-cost averaging into a diversified investment vehicle over a 40 year period is not the same as buying a consumer product.
4444 2018-12-21 23:47:19 I sure hope stocks get hammered in 2019. That’s when I’ll be making my first RESP contribution. I can’t wait to show my son or daughter how much that first contribution grew in value over 18 years. #financialeducation
4445 2018-12-21 23:46:27 They can’t do anything unless the Republican controlled Senate goes along with them. Why are you continuing to use scare tactics with your base (like me) instead of fighting to stop Trump from doing anything to infringe on our 2nd Amendment rights (bump stocks)?!
4446 2018-12-21 23:46:25 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to improve your insomnia
4447 2018-12-21 23:46:23 @scoggggs are you pumped about Mad Dog leaving and bump stocks being banned?
4448 2018-12-21 23:45:27 racists are only “””sorry””” when their stocks go down
4449 2018-12-21 23:45:07 Worst week for stocks since 2008. #TrumpResign
4450 2018-12-21 23:44:24 Never had any stocks. Just bills.

4454 2018-12-21 23:42:37 Oh, um, ok.

Buying stocks today is buying the stocks of the last bull market.
By the time we start going up again, a whole new set of companies (stocks) may very well replace the stocks/sectors of the now-ending bull mkt

Lower prices doesn't equal improvement. See tvs.
4455 2018-12-21 23:42:33 Anyone use TradeNet for trading options ? Used them for stocks but not options.  Looking at either Tradenet which recently heard a lot of negatives about or Tasty Trades.  Tasty Trade has very low borrow fees, but never seen there platform.

4459 2018-12-21 23:41:13 YTD, the U.S. #PermanentPortfolio is down 3.31%, which now places it ahead of the stock market (no surprise) and a 60/40 portfolio (VTI/BND down 5.56% on the year). Not many portfolios working well this year.

4461 2018-12-21 23:40:59 Though, I guess I can't blame Donnie Jr. for lying to try to distract from the house fire that is this administration.   Stocks falling, indictments coming, Mattis leaving...what a disaster.
4462 2018-12-21 23:40:24 @realDonaldTrump Hey FUCKHEAD, how are your stocks doing today? I have lost 7,000. This week. Fund your FUCKEN WALL YOURSELF YOU FUCKTARD!
4463 2018-12-21 23:40:12 Plus stamina 999 with 10 stocks with no time limit and fs meter, try me bitch
4464 2018-12-21 23:39:50 and there's part of your answer to your question the other day when you were wondering why bank stocks were getting hammered.  Bank balance sheets are in as bad or worse shape now than in 2008.  Book value has been built up with non-cash phantom GAAP income
4465 2018-12-21 23:39:45 Why in the hell is bump stocks being banned????
4466 2018-12-21 23:39:24 While profiting from selling healthcare stocks ahead of publicly available news
4467 2018-12-21 23:39:14 I didn't get into $ES today, which is good, I probably would have messed it up. I was down on the day cause I hold a bunch of stocks, but not much 0.35% on acct. Which also included a lotto ticket long so all in all happy with it
4468 2018-12-21 23:38:43 lmao the stocks are at their lowest week in 10 years and there’s a gov shutdown happening but trump thinks everything’s okay!! I’m screaming!!!!!

DECEMBER 17, 2018

With local fishermen in Somalia struggling to compete with foreign boats that are ravaging fishing stocks, the government has granted 31 fishing licenses to China. Somali president, Mohamed Abdullahi
4475 2018-12-21 23:37:04 Why do you want people to drink so much. Do you have a drinking problem. Or, are you trying to keep people buzzed out so they can’t keep up with the damage you are creating. Enjoy your martinis with your rich buddies. Did you buy stocks in LCBO...
4476 2018-12-21 23:36:44 Whenever Charlie and I buy common stocks...we approach the transaction as if we were buying into a private business.  We look at the economic prospects of the business, the people in charge of running it, and the price we must pay. - Berkshire Hathaway Annual Letter 1987
4477 2018-12-21 23:35:47 You know your close to a near term low when your friends start asking you how to short stocks......using the Acorns app. #marketlow #bloodinthestreets
4478 2018-12-21 23:35:44 Not to worry! We have @NASA_ICESat2 for the boreal, and in the *minimum* two year mission length we will finally cover the tropical and temperate with lidar to get carbon stocks, which will then be tracked through time with @NASA_Landsat
4479 2018-12-21 23:35:40 @realDonaldTrump 100% guarantee you will not be elected since you banned bump stocks.
4480 2018-12-21 23:35:19 Much better to put him (or her?) in the stocks for 24hrs in Gatwick Departures Area...
4481 2018-12-21 23:35:16 Another 2% drop in the S&P today for like the 5th day in a row. Can’t wait for this recession to start so I can start buying stocks for pennies on the dollar
4482 2018-12-21 23:34:41 All these people have been getting rich off Wall Street War Stocks and Oil Stocks for so long now, it's like a drug for them. Wars paid for off the backs of Americans living paycheck to paycheck. @ACLU @POTUS #NYC #Congress #MSM
4483 2018-12-21 23:34:01 All I know is I would not want to be that person holding stocks in year 2019.
4484 2018-12-21 23:34:00 It’s called a correction, ever heard of those? What do you think that stocks run up forever?
4485 2018-12-21 23:33:58 Given that Donald #Trump always claims the credit when anything goes well will he also accept any responsibility for US stocks having their worst week in a decade? Any bets?
4486 2018-12-21 23:33:41 The right stocks are key
4487 2018-12-21 23:32:47 Was not paying attention and I think these girls in the bathroom at Macy's just made fun of my socks n stocks
4488 2018-12-21 23:32:18 @Nike what’s the deal with the horrible stocks for off-whites we get in Canada. No snkrs app even, what we do to y’all?
4489 2018-12-21 23:32:10 Or tell them how stocks are doing 
4490 2018-12-21 23:32:07 So if they've outlawed bump-stocks, what's stopping me from just developing an auto-trigger that squeezes really fast?
4491 2018-12-21 23:31:43 Sir u really should check yourself & ur facts. 1st. Campaign promise Mexico will pay 4 wall. No USA residents 2. Stocks falling 3. Jobs coming home 4. Oil will be in wide demand. Stop using Trump as a rating marketing hoax. Love ur country more than ratings
4492 2018-12-21 23:31:11 We  need you out. Healthcare costs up. Debt rising. Interest rates rising. Stocks crashing. You being a coward with Russia and the Middle East.  You are a National Disaster and embarrassment.
4493 2018-12-21 23:30:42 Guess you haven't noticed the stocks plummeting the last few weeks.
4494 2018-12-21 23:29:37 In addition to being the worst December for stocks dince 1931, the velocity of this month's drops for the S&P, Dow and Nasdaq mirrors the crash of 1987 (Dow Jones Market Data)
4495 2018-12-21 23:28:50 Breaking news. Worst week for stocks since the Bush administration. You still taking credit for the market?
4496 2018-12-21 23:28:35 Look at it this way, stocks are about 20% cheaper now than they were at their peak earlier this year.  Everyone likes a sale.
4497 2018-12-21 23:28:19 lmao buddy you need money to short stocks. how do you think this works
4498 2018-12-21 23:28:11 Damn this threat of govt shut down is really messing with my stocks 
4499 2018-12-21 23:27:20 In 18 months of President Trump the stocks skyrocketed to over 28,000. Now I will give you that they have fallen because of terriffs and trade negotiations with China, but that was already expected do to what the outcome will or will not be. Just give him a chance? Only been 2yrs
4500 2018-12-21 23:27:19 How about people who own fossil fuel stocks, @RepDebDingell?
4501 2018-12-21 23:26:35 Time for energy n safe dividend stocks 
4502 2018-12-21 23:25:43 remember in december you said reversal i believe it was a knife sound? but we are here and that was then and this is now regardless I'm way out on my calls and my shares on stocks I've never sold only added,.... you will never understand this if you don't listen
4503 2018-12-21 23:25:08 Yeah, you totally are! It's like trading stocks, you have a great year and extrapolate that big % gain out year after year until you have your portfolio at a $bil before you know it!
4504 2018-12-21 23:24:36 How does A WALL = Border Security???  Under. Over. Staying too long on Visa. Rediculous to put so much $$$ into a wall!  Bankrupting USA. Stocks tanking!
4505 2018-12-21 23:24:34 For the week, the U.S. #PermanentPortfolio down 0.93%. A drop but a ho-hum kind of drop on a scary week for stocks.

VTI -7.23% #stocks
TLT +2.13% #bonds
IAU +1.35% #gold

4507 2018-12-21 23:24:12 The clear intent of the current law is to keep guns from firing at the a certain speed. Bump stocks are a loophole because the language didnt foresee accessories like this from being made. I'm 100%against the president or anyone else waving their pen and just changing the law.
4508 2018-12-21 23:24:04 You mean trading options? First, I'd just look at trading stocks. Then trading options later. Options are super dangerous and you can lose a lot of money quickly. I only dabble in it with money I'm comfortable losing.
But I don't have any books off the top of my head, sorry.
4509 2018-12-21 23:24:01 Bump stocks are not to blame for the shooting here in Vegas. However, I suspect it does have something to do with Obama gun running to cartels. He really sucks at gun running, he needs to find a new job.
4510 2018-12-21 23:22:46 Cool could she divest her stocks?
4511 2018-12-21 23:22:00 Maybe your portfolio shouldn’t have been littered with 200 P/E stocks...
4512 2018-12-21 23:21:56 The licenses are for 3 months and restricted to Tuna stocks only. $32,000 per boat is a good deal. Morocco, Africa's Fisheries giant charges the EU only $150 million for UNRESTRICTED access to all of its waters & any specie of fish. 

If  can reinvest  in boats, even better.
4513 2018-12-21 23:21:44 I think our local pet shop stocks it. I’ll send M to look n we can post it 
4514 2018-12-21 23:21:36 After getting my asshole singed multiple times over the last two months I have decided to implement a “falling knife” only short approach. 

I want to see immediate consecutive daily payoffs.
Only island tops breaking down.

I don’t short stocks that did well post-txgvg rally.

4516 2018-12-21 23:21:08 The #PermanentPortfolio down 0.66% today. Bonds and cash steady but nothing to really offset another big drop in stocks.

4517 2018-12-21 23:20:51 caitlin just changed it to a wall st radio station i don’t want to kno about stocks this is adjacent to my personal hell
4518 2018-12-21 23:20:41 @drysvictim Follow me, I'd like to have a private chat with you about pharma stocks.
4519 2018-12-21 23:20:15 I sold most my 401k stocks long ago as told others #POTUS45 would crash our economy in a matter of time . Appears that I was right  Keep it up #TheRealDonaldTrump  , bring that #Dow right on down with you and your reckless behavior
4520 2018-12-21 23:19:48 If the stock market is going to crash, please hurry up so once we get a democratic president in 2020 he/she will have 8 years for a market recovery about the time I can retire and pull all out of stocks.
4521 2018-12-21 23:19:09 75% of Americans dont own stocks. What does that tell you about liberal Democrats and who they represent?
4522 2018-12-21 23:18:59 Bump stocks barely created a ripple in the chaos chamber this week.
4523 2018-12-21 23:18:58 Trump bankrupting United States just like his businesses. Repeatedly he ties himself to the stocks, so there it is!
4524 2018-12-21 23:18:42 You want $5.7  Billion Dollars for  wall that won't work... We are $22 Trillion dollars I. Debt and we add $1 Trillion dollars to the defiect each year thanks to your Corporate Tax Cuts for the rich! Where is the Tea Party? We are Broke and stocks plumeting for the year!
4525 2018-12-21 23:18:31 Please resign! You’re incompetent. Stocks are tanking. Major correction happening and Americans are losing millions. Your staff continues to resign. You’re failing Americans
4526 2018-12-21 23:16:53 Out of touch with most Americans I see. Not surprised since you talk stocks all day...
4527 2018-12-21 23:16:46 Rich pricks are dumping stocks with poor returns but those small returns would be great for average Americans
 Greed 101
4528 2018-12-21 23:16:38 Stocks took a predictable beating today, with Apple falling to $150. About $80 off its Oct 3 high. That is quite a drop in a couple of months.
4529 2018-12-21 23:16:05 President Trump is not going to get reelected no Wall & Bump Stocks gone...he lost the Woman in 2018 & now he is going to lose the men
4530 2018-12-21 23:16:01 Occupying the Mattis and Mueller and stocks air time, with self-made disaster.
4531 2018-12-21 23:15:45 Stocks crashing?? Really?? That’s funny...
4532 2018-12-21 23:15:44 So much for investing in concrete stocks. Now it's gonna cost more because of his steel tariffs. Man, @realDonaldTrump is dumb.
4533 2018-12-21 23:14:10 Trump understands that he HAS to come through with the Wall and getting out of military quagmires around the world, as he no longer has a stock bubble to get him re-elected in 2020.  The timing of the swoon in stocks and his sudden turn back towards candidate Trump's goals...
4534 2018-12-21 23:14:06 Stocks are having the worst December since 1931 and the government is about to shut down, leaving about 750,000 people working without paychecks. But the economy, amirite?
4535 2018-12-21 23:13:47 Ite I believe you Sonic mains, was baffled for about two stocks fighting character in Ultimate but then he was like fighting a child's book.
4536 2018-12-21 23:13:06 #TrumpResign Stocks in worst shape since the Depression. What do you expect with the Bankruptcy King and Tariff Man?
4537 2018-12-21 23:12:52 Yep, my stocks tanked. 
4538 2018-12-21 23:12:30 The companies who all received a tax cut are contained in the group who paid themselves a record of 1.1 trillion in buy-back stocks of their own companies.
4539 2018-12-21 23:12:24 Ugh. Remind me not to look at my stock portfolio for a while. I got these stocks for long term investments so I gotta stop watching them like short term ones.
4540 2018-12-21 23:11:33 This is fed deliberately crashing stocks by jacking the interest rate up AGAIN.
4541 2018-12-21 23:10:51 Notice stocks began to drop right after Dems took the House, just as they skyrocketed the moment DJ Trump took the Presidency.
4542 2018-12-21 23:10:41 To be able to pick up cheap stuff I need lots of cash, so right now I own (almost) 0% stocks. But there’s really nothing I want anyway. Too high P/E numbers for me to even wanna own anything (besides HM, which has come down a bit)
4543 2018-12-21 23:10:25 The Trump trade will be obliterated at just under 21,000 Dow Jones.  This is why people HATE Wall Street. They CREATED the TRUMP trade, made billions of dollars, got a huge tax cut then made money when the market plummets by shorting the stocks. This was all a Republian hoax.
4544 2018-12-21 23:10:24 Classic exaggeration.

Stock market "tanking" means stocks are more affordable.  It's a better time to buy than last week.

Nothing better than buying stocks when they're cheap.
4545 2018-12-21 23:10:21 Foreign policy - NKorea, Russia, Saudis , Israel got trumps number
 Domestic- no infrastructure bill, VA disarray, stocks tumbling.
Trade- China, tariffs confusion
Cabinet- good ones leaving trumps swamp.
No wall.
2A. infringed

Trump couldnt be presidential. 
Corruption rules
4546 2018-12-21 23:10:04 Maybe.  Stocks being overpriced 40pct miiiiight be a factor
4547 2018-12-21 23:09:40 What happened with Mexico paying for the wall?  Maybe you can rescind that 1.8T tax cut you gave to your donors and the 1% and spend it on border security.  After all, those tax cuts went for buy back stocks - not for the American people.  The GOP is a joke!
4548 2018-12-21 23:09:34 stocks are bad because they incentivize the public to root for the success of morally bankrupt corporations in hopes that they will benefit from their market share at the expense of their workers. the means of production should be collectivized not profitized for shareholders.
4549 2018-12-21 23:09:22 $SPY You can't put all of your focus just on the major indexes. Look at individual stocks, the strongest of them crumbling. $AAPL $AMZN etc.
4550 2018-12-21 23:08:48 Not if you’re a massive investor which Inam not but the people selling off are. When rates are high stocks decline and the value of bonds increase. Look I’m not gonna change your mind so enjoy your weekend
4551 2018-12-21 23:08:16 Rough estimate - 16 to 18%.

Pretty substantial over a ~10 week timeframe.

It's overblown, V-shape event, panicky traders, confusing data.

I'm looking at all the wonderful stocks to buy at these levels...
4552 2018-12-21 23:07:53 Don't sweat the stock thing.  We all know that, like, 90% of the global market is a sham, and most of these stocks don't represent any actual productivity or innovation.  Of course, they're overvalued.  Of course, they'll correct.
4553 2018-12-21 23:07:42 well we're not having those stages anymore either lol, t&c got adjusted because of that and we're not even using dreamland

it's just too fucking weird, we don't need a singular stage where people's stocks are cut in half
4554 2018-12-21 23:07:33 It’s all about the #Potstocks uplist to an American Market?

On the Nasdaq, only 8 companies hit new 52-week highs today.

1,101 stocks hit new 52-week lows.
4555 2018-12-21 23:07:26 So @kathygriffin is allowed to post Fuck Trump Christmas ornaments on @Twitter BUT MY ACCOUNT GETS LIMITED WHEN I TELL HER TO FUCK OFF.
@Twitter I hope your stocks crash and burn 
#FuckingHypocrits
4556 2018-12-21 23:07:15 stop buying stocks oh my god
4557 2018-12-21 23:06:48 Stocks appeared expensive w/o factoring in the forward earnings. But after Fed’s grave mistake IMHO, any level in equity indices is too high. Fed’s “independent” policy cornered itself that they won’t be able to cut w/o losing credibility until Feb. Crash may be only beginning!
4558 2018-12-21 23:06:32 What platform do you use to buy stocks? Seeing that number drop is intriguing as hell.

4562 2018-12-21 23:05:56 Yes. And in 10 years, I made at least 10 recommendations to buy certain particular stocks. Some of which only went up 300 to 500%, but some of which were 10 baggers, and some like Siri, went from $0.06 to  $5.00 & no one ever listened, so I stopped recommending.
4563 2018-12-21 23:05:54 $Crypto as a whole moves rather quickly. Last December we saw a double top on Bitcoin, then watched the market dump with little warning. I believe the same patterns are playing out in stocks, specifically the $DJI.
4564 2018-12-21 23:05:54 think this syncs well with today's environment being a good parallel for late 90s / early 2000s cycle. Would also expect housing to hold up reasonably well. Also shows stocks could easily fall 50% even in just a mild recession
4565 2018-12-21 23:05:43 Stocks fall because of the troop withdrawal. Don't kick the confidence level back to Obama!

4567 2018-12-21 23:05:31 Why would you use a stock in a CQC scenario? It's hard enough to keep your elbows tucked.
Stocks are for shooting turkey
4568 2018-12-21 23:05:22 This is just Algos pushing stocks lower as buyers arent stepping up.  That is the problem without real market makers

The oversold, stocks have to bounce rally?  Nope

The rally that always saves die hard longs? Nope

The expected relief rally, even from bears? Nope

Christmas rally?  Nope

It's different this time. It's always different this time.
4570 2018-12-21 23:05:10 In some cases surely , not in all , my unless was involved in a strike in the docks because they wanted toilets at work , wasn’t reported that way . British industry boomed in the fifties as orders came in to replace depleted stocks of , ships , planes cars etc , this led to ..
4571 2018-12-21 23:04:51 my stocks are tumbling this week. legit loss money. WTF!
4572 2018-12-21 23:04:31 Shorting is hard, and I wonder if it’s worth the risk. I trade stocks in business cycles, and try to buy the really deep dips (PE = 7), and that has been very profitable. Bear markets usually come back, and it looks like Fed will bring one again. Lots of debt lying around=bearish
4573 2018-12-21 23:04:12 While I can understand that stock market pushers may only be motivated by financial concerns, the health dept tasked with regulating a controlled product clearly has slightly broader and more important concerns than how your stocks are doing this week.
4574 2018-12-21 23:04:01 Trump supporters dont own stocks. They only care about the price of oxycodone 
4575 2018-12-21 23:02:59 It's all good. The other side of the baby boom is the death boom that will come at the end of their existence. Buy hospice and funeral home stocks, imo.
4576 2018-12-21 23:02:58 Not a chance ! 

Wait to you see the amount of businesses crumbling in the first 3 months of next year. 

Businesses have been using up all there reserve money and stocks to try and turn the corner.

1 day certainly will not cut it 

Its gonna get worse
4577 2018-12-21 23:02:49 Likely U´re Right, but drops are going far beyond expected. Stocks could keep on falling  this way for a long time and many analists would remain saying markets are about to resume the recovery.
4578 2018-12-21 23:02:26 Guess I’m gonna be back buying a bunch of stocks this Christmas.
4579 2018-12-21 23:02:15 Those...are not empty threats.
But having said that, criminal justice reform ( even though it ignores racial disparity) is good.
Banning bump stocks, is also good.
But my liberal friends refuse to acknowledge either.
This can only end in less overall progress and more vitriol.
4580 2018-12-21 23:02:10 @realDonaldTrump Stocks plunged again on Friday, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average to its worst week since the financial crisis in 2008, down nearly 7 percent.
So Much WINNING

4590 2018-12-21 22:57:55 You own this. Wow..worst year for stocks since 1930's! All this winning.
4591 2018-12-21 22:57:55 So King Donald got Bitch McConnell to gut Judiciary & now both succeeded in indefinite shut down. King Donald only branch left, long in planning. Stocks tanked, economy down. Great, right?
4592 2018-12-21 22:57:51 If you use 2 stocks on quick play you give up all your rights
4593 2018-12-21 22:57:42 a lesson learned v early in my career.  don't talk individual stocks with anyone that's not a professional.
4594 2018-12-21 22:56:26 Where the hell am I supposed to get money to be buying stocks?! I can barely afford stockings for Christmas and you can get them at the Dollar Tree.
4595 2018-12-21 22:56:21 Terrified. This has been one of the worst weeks in American history: stocks crashing, trump just gave putin everything on his wish list (the Middle East, some sanctions lifted).
4596 2018-12-21 22:56:16 Well, Italy (sovereign and stocks) not bad either (sarcasm).
4597 2018-12-21 22:55:39 Just ask them how their stocks are doing. (DOW is down 10% from a year ago, down 20% from its January high... right when Trump implemented his trade war.) If they grumble, say it's not all bad news: Billionaires still have their tax break and will start investing any minute now!

THIS JUDGE, SHERIFF, MAGISTRATE  OR WHATEVER

4600 2018-12-21 22:54:29 Any good drone stocks to invest in?
4601 2018-12-21 22:54:08 It would be peculiar, but obv previous roadmaps don’t always hold true going forward. Feels like a similar version of what’s happened to housing stocks wrt stock prices vs fundies
4602 2018-12-21 22:54:03 I invested in Tech and technology stocks. I believe in a diverse portfolio.
4603 2018-12-21 22:53:53 I think you are right about guns made before 86 and I think you need to be class 3 FFL dealer to own full autos made after 86. Since the stocks were made after 86, my argument probably won’t fly. But they can still adopt language to make it work if they really want to.
4604 2018-12-21 22:53:52 That dude sounds like a con to me. Teaching others how to trade stocks.
4605 2018-12-21 22:53:41 Everything he does is to look good for shareholders. That’s why they beg him to stop tweeting, because their stocks tank when he does.
4606 2018-12-21 22:53:30 This last week was the worst week for U.S. stocks since the Great Recession.
4607 2018-12-21 22:53:23 If you trash Trump over stocks without mentioning the rate hikes, you are a phony and fraud.  
Only the lowest IQ consumers of news do not know this fact and if that is your audience... I’m sorry for you.
4608 2018-12-21 22:53:20 Bear markets are when stocks return to their rightful owners. I think it was JP Morgan who said it.
4609 2018-12-21 22:53:10 This last week was the worst week for U.S. stocks since the Great Recession.

U.S. stocks suffer worst week in a decade
4612 2018-12-21 22:50:57 Given what's going on, I'm amazed at the number of people I know who got into stocks at exactly the same time a few weeks ago.
4613 2018-12-21 22:50:21 nan de sur y'a deux paires différentes, une non réflective qui aura de gros gros stocks, et une réflective avec un stock très limité, mais visiblement les deux paires vont sortir à peu près en même temps

 its would be ok if they just banned them being sold, But what he did making everyone destroy them or turn in, very bad! W/next

4621 2018-12-21 22:48:22 Hey moron, "After a month of heavy losses, stocks are on track for their worst year since 2008." You've been channeling Bush but you're about to plunge us into a depression. Smooth move you perverted piece of orange obesity.
4622 2018-12-21 22:48:06 Jim, what is the quote about stocks returning to their rightful owners?
4623 2018-12-21 22:48:02 A lot of the Dow30 stocks are about to hit major support levels, so I'm suspecting we get a massive strong rebound after the holidays.  It is a very volatile market now and what swings down will swing sharply up before it continues downward.
4624 2018-12-21 22:47:50 If Trumps latest actions do not initiate a debate on reducing executive power .....banning bump stocks pulling out of Syria Failing to build the wall 

Americans are fated to be ruled by Obama like saviors making fascism very likely

Squeak squeak
4625 2018-12-21 22:47:47 @OptionsAction Where were these guys before the market crash. I’m sure the video would shoe that they didn’t recommend swelling stocks. The main issue is over-leveraged hedge funds and volatile ETFS. So, there’s been a waved of forced liquidations. These guys have no credibility.
4626 2018-12-21 22:47:45 Trump Administration Makes Bump Stocks Illegal

4643 2018-12-21 22:41:54 I was the President of a Gun Club a few years back. We banned bump stocks. Just because its a control issue. I dont believe in them. There is no tactical purpose for them. What I have an issue with the classification. This can and should be banned as a destructive device.

4660 2018-12-21 22:38:05 So, the trickle down corporate tax cuts should even it out right? Oh, they used that money to buy back their own stocks instead of raising wages? Interesting. At least some states are holding them accountable for their tax heist. TY california.
4661 2018-12-21 22:37:41 the reason I'm going to buy pot stocks is the same reason I was opposed to weed being legal. It is highly addictive. I used to feel too guilty to profit from people's stupidity. No more.
4662 2018-12-21 22:37:28 The problem with @realDonaldTrump is that he doesn’t care that the @NYSE is tanking since his base doesn’t own any stocks.
4663 2018-12-21 22:37:00 I think Trump will take us into war. He thinks it’s good for the economy. He and his friends own Raytheon and other stocks. And I think trump made a deal with Erik Prince & his mercenaries. That’s who he’s sending to Syria & Afghanistan.
4664 2018-12-21 22:36:44 President Trump band bump stocks which I fully support but the mainstream media is totally 100% silent on this I am a proud member of the NRA and a proud, very proud gun owner MAGA
4665 2018-12-21 22:36:11 You're too easily placated. You're getting no wall and only $5B (should've been at least $25B) while the US just sent $10B in foreign aid to Central America & Mexico, bump stocks just got banned and felons just got their own jailbreak bill.

4667 2018-12-21 22:34:52 Most Americans? Get a grip.  The stock market is not for most Americans.  It's for rich people. Sure folks have stocks in their IRAs, but >80% of $ value of stocks are controlled by top ~ 10% rich people.

4687 2018-12-21 22:27:59 his base doesn't have stocks, they don't have any teeth either
4688 2018-12-21 22:27:57 I want to know how much the 1% lost. Must be more than 10% bc they are more invested in the market. Or is it all cash offshore? Or invested in the Brazil, Saudi, Israel markets which are doing very well? I doubt 60% of Americans have stocks
4689 2018-12-21 22:27:28 Hang on everyone, as with every single one in the past, this bear market will prove to be temporary. The challenge is to be emotionally strong enough (and adequately diversified) to survive it! #yvr #stocks #longterm
4690 2018-12-21 22:27:02 One way American's people base to invst stocks market even a pension.
4691 2018-12-21 22:26:33 LRT I will do that even if I’m ahead two stocks
4692 2018-12-21 22:26:31 Tech stocks have been hit hard because they do business all over the world. They should use some of their cash & buyback stock. EG Apple. Trump had one thing going for him & now that’s shot to shit. Grow up potus. Before we lose everything !!
4693 2018-12-21 22:26:03 Certainly a wild ride today, I noticed $URA closed at its lowest ever level today following its launch in 2010.  As I look for any comparisons I see that on 30th Dec 2016 URA went down to $12.87 and by 27th Jan 2017 reached $17.67.  History shows #Uranium stocks move very fast!
4694 2018-12-21 22:25:20 #1: potus has had nothing to do with how well the stocks WERE doing-- anyone with a brain should know that; #2 : potus is having EVERYTHING to do with the stocks caving right now. Of course, the MAGAtwits will deny it even as it's the undeniable truth. #section4.
4695 2018-12-21 22:25:08 No it’s called stocks were extremely overvalued thanks to cheap credit, debt driven govt spending and financial engineering. They are now being exposed for just that as rates are finally neutral for the first time in almost a decade.
4696 2018-12-21 22:24:51 This has do with fed reserve raising interest rates, & companies will not look to expand operations with higher interest raises do to much of their funding is through debt, so investors are pulling their money out of stocks do to a reduction growth projections and higher payments
4697 2018-12-21 22:24:45 Banning bump-stocks. Does it matter much?
4698 2018-12-21 22:24:38 I remember when him and Dog were talking about Yoohoo stocks
4699 2018-12-21 22:24:26 Slippery slope only has one interpretation. When I thing starts, it leads to another and another. Which is what you exactly applied. So, how is banning bump stocks bad?
4700 2018-12-21 22:24:21 I wonder who has been buying stocks in steel and construction this year.
4701 2018-12-21 22:23:58 EA Stocks Plummet by $21 Billion, Earnings Forecast 

Battlefront2 bombed lootboxes
max effect3 bombed garbage
battlefield v bombed - dont buy it - so we didnt.
fifa 19 under investigation for loot boxes
dragon age4 pushing there politics.

get woke - go 21 billion broke .
4702 2018-12-21 22:23:52 Hi folks,

1) the Dow closed at 22,445.

2) Dow 20,000 was euphoric.

Remember: price declines don’t make stocks cheaper. Their values could have declined by more. 

Investing = price vs estimated value.
4703 2018-12-21 22:23:41 Tax cuts for corporations; more part time/ fewer full time jobs and still stagnant wages; stocks tanked and economy slowing; Korea is still building nukes; border is no more or less secure than ever; he donated nothing this last year, just his first; Canada got the better trade.
4704 2018-12-21 22:23:36 Worst year, week and month for stocks in 10 years with a booming US economy with nearly full employment. Trump can do to wall street what it would normally take a global financial crisis.  #TrumpResign
4705 2018-12-21 22:23:26 All the Rethugs said the companies who were given huge tax cuts would reinstate the money into their employees. Not so.
1.1 trillion dollars was used to buy back their own stocks. 
Just like the Dems warned would happen.
4706 2018-12-21 22:23:13 If only someone would talk about how much profit @Jacob_Rees_Mogg's SCM fund makes each time his machinations cause perfectly predictable moves in stocks and sterling
4707 2018-12-21 22:23:03 Just a reminder: 
Bad week at the stock market? 1% buy stocks as everybody else runs away.
Recession? 1% buy basically everything.
4708 2018-12-21 22:22:56 I think its something like 80% of stocks are held by 10% of Americans
4709 2018-12-21 22:22:47 Apparently, not stocks.
4710 2018-12-21 22:21:54 Ça représente quelle masse de tritium ? Parce que vu les faibles stocks, le peu qu'on produit, et qu'on en a besoin pour la fusion (ITER), ça pourrait valoir le coup...
4711 2018-12-21 22:21:50 Worst December for stocks since 1930. #TrumpResign
4712 2018-12-21 22:21:43 84% of stocks are owned by the top 10% of the economy. You're panicked for yourself. You don't work for a living, you suck up capital gains like a vampire and pay barely an tax on it.
4713 2018-12-21 22:21:29 By the way, I am a Free Thinking Independent person that watches PBS, BBC and NPR. I know what bias is and Trump is the Czar of UNAMERICAN FAKE NEWS STORIES! He is a Liar and is also against guns! He has banned bump stocks and made them a Felony to possess! -Proud Gun Owner here
4714 2018-12-21 22:21:29 He just wants to let it burn and then profiteer as stocks drop and people lose their homes.
4715 2018-12-21 22:21:14 The more stocks fall fast the more folks envision bad things. It always works like that. Always. I did a USA Today column on that. But fast drops like December are about the most bullish sign you can get. Remember the V.
4716 2018-12-21 22:20:50 If you are using @RobinhoodApp  and an 'options' person you are paying hefty fees. 'No commission' is just an illusion. $IBKR beats it big time any day. I would assume same with stocks too.
4717 2018-12-21 22:20:44 . Well didn’t the Secretary of the Treasury say stocks are a bargain now?
4718 2018-12-21 22:20:12 Nothing good can happen this weekend for stocks. DB going under, government wall fight, Peter Navarro throbbing red vein in neck starting war with .

The only mitigators was lapse in trade war (getting significantly worse) and “fed clarifies.” Fed tried twice!
4719 2018-12-21 22:20:09 Moonshine stocks are up!!!
4720 2018-12-21 22:19:46 Markets Down! 
Well, duh. Zero interest rates forever, Fed buying bonds. Only chance of return is in stocks. Stocks go up.
Fed raises rates, unwinding the QE, bubbles based on ez money burst & stocks tank.
None of this is on Trump.
4721 2018-12-21 22:19:40 Well, I disagree but stocks arent the only way to increase your net worth.
4722 2018-12-21 22:19:22 No brand experience has ever been worse than @MoviePass. The worst investment of 2018...and I bought a lot of tech stocks this year.

Seriously, let me see a movie.
4723 2018-12-21 22:19:11 The gloom and doom in my TL over stocks from everybody and their dog suggests the time to buy is nigh.
4724 2018-12-21 22:19:06 Simple!  8 interest rate hikes reduce available cash and investors having a VERY negative outcome for stocks housing and jobs!   This is deliberate sabatoge
4725 2018-12-21 22:19:05 Is your admin short stocks?  Wtf is up with Navarro?  Nobody cares about your wall.  The markets and economy is crashing thanks to your policies!
4726 2018-12-21 22:19:01 When were the checks and stocks returned? Dates please.
4727 2018-12-21 22:18:34 We'll remember in 2020 that TRUMP shut down the government because of a temper tantrum right before the holidays-voters will remember too how their stocks plummeted & their holidays ruined for what a wall-we already have walls, fences & security - open walls make a great ladder
4728 2018-12-21 22:18:27 Don't play the penny stocks.
4729 2018-12-21 22:18:24 may be only reason I stay a registered Republican. U should educate the public in a fireside chat as to why we need the Wall 4 nat't security, 401's are getting destroyed tt plunge in stocks. Retiree wealth is evaporating before our eyes. Blame Fed. Your base is hurting Mr. Pres.
4730 2018-12-21 22:18:10 I used the term "meaningful way" to express the idea that only 5% of the population owns stocks to a degree that it matters. The rest just have scraps.

(We're in a great country. I wish everyone the best. Merry Christmas.)
4731 2018-12-21 22:17:54 not making friends with anyone who thinks they can go online with 2 stocks
4732 2018-12-21 22:17:39 @SteveGrassoCNBC To go red for the year $AMZN needs to close below $1169. $NFLX needs to close below $191.69. $MSFT needs to close below $84.08. $AAPL just an FYI closed 2017 at $166.73. I tweeted earlier today i wondered if they would try and make those stocks red for 2018.
4733 2018-12-21 22:17:19 Full autos fire at a higher rate than semiautomatics, yes. As far as bump stocks, it depends on how fast you can manually pull the trigger. It is still one bullet per trigger pull, even with a bump stock, thus still semiautomatic, and not as fast as full auto.
4734 2018-12-21 22:17:10 Worst December for stocks since the 1930s. So much bigly winning.
4735 2018-12-21 22:16:51 Remember this:

Watching leading stocks will tell you much more about the health and direction of the market than any index or economics degree ever will.
4736 2018-12-21 22:16:24 Market Close: MBS +6bps; DOW -414.23; NASDAQ -195.41; S&P 500 -50.80; 10yr Treasury 2.79%; Worries over Fed Hikes, Slowing Global Economy & Partial Gov't Shutdown knocks down stocks again!
4737 2018-12-21 22:16:16 Humpty Trumpty fell off his wall
Humpty Trumpty had a great fall
He shut down the government out of pure spite
Stocks fell so low that they’re nowhere in sight.
4738 2018-12-21 22:15:56 Is Trump taking credit for the stocks tumbling or nah?
4739 2018-12-21 22:15:45 This shutdown is all your boy Trump and your party you addle brained cup of bull pizzle. Syria, Mattis, Stocks crashing, shutdown looming...should I go back farther than 48 hours?
4740 2018-12-21 22:15:32 True.

The negative wealth effect is going to continue to hit stocks like #TIF, and #MAR...as people cut vacations and expensive gifts out of their budgets first off.

As I said 60 days ago....just take the 2%-3% return on the cash in your portfolio n be happy w that !
4741 2018-12-21 22:15:08 you have stocks? You are more adult than you appear online Jedsun.
4742 2018-12-21 22:15:03 You know what I meant. Bump stocks may indeed be irrelevant but Leftists of all stripes have chipping away #2A forever... their goal *is* nationwide disarmament eventually, thru whatever means.
4743 2018-12-21 22:14:55 Hospitals around the country reporting surge in ER patients this week with severe hand lacerations. Most report they sustained them trying unsuccessfully to catch falling stocks.
4744 2018-12-21 22:14:26 Please don’t make me famous I actually like being harassed by people because I make their coffee the best at crackhead (no offense) hours. That’s not even sarcasm because then I won’t have a discount or stocks and a 401k, please add Crohn’s Disease to your disability. @Starbucks
4745 2018-12-21 22:14:22 Who has a prediction? Will Chinese stocks dip hard on this news?
4746 2018-12-21 22:13:38 Give us that god damn right shoulder uptick first so we can unload stocks! God dammit haha
4747 2018-12-21 22:13:35 If you are retired your 401K shouldn't have a lot of stocks. They are structured to limit loss the older you become.
4748 2018-12-21 22:13:28 wait a sec...I'll RT you a chart where you can get 6% on stocks....
4749 2018-12-21 22:13:17 That's about as reasonable and realistic as turning in bump stocks.
4750 2018-12-21 22:13:15 My firm is “defensively biased” so we’re doing pretty well right now. Naturally I’m loading up on stocks personally.
4751 2018-12-21 22:13:12 $SPY $IWM So much for oversold so stocks have to bounce. Remember how stocks ran up when bullish and overbought?  Pendulum swings both ways!
4752 2018-12-21 22:13:10 huh ? 401k and military retirement is now 401k ... figure it out stop with the tired no one owns stocks but the monopoly man in a tux
4753 2018-12-21 22:12:52 KNOW YOUR MENTOR!!!

A FURU is someone who

Wishes to share his wisdom

4755 2018-12-21 22:12:30 If you aren’t buying stocks right now you are un-american and also hate Christmas
4756 2018-12-21 22:12:30 No hes purposely running the stocks down as low as he can get them before he is removed from office or resigns the, so that all his rich friends can buy them up at low prices and wait for the democrats to bring the stock market back, AGAIN.

4760 2018-12-21 22:10:20 with all seriousness, you are so good at predicting both crypto and stocks, have you ever thought of starting your own hedge fund or do you also live by your crypto name? Followed you since august this year and haven't had any regrets yet for crypto.i don't do legacy markets..
4761 2018-12-21 22:10:19 @GOP It should be obvious that trump is betting on the failure of the US economy! Every time trump opens his mouth stocks tumble.

4763 2018-12-21 22:09:57 No you didn’t ban bump stocks and yes Obama Admin passed them.
4764 2018-12-21 22:09:52 dumb comment. stocks make up 401ks ... almost all retirement plans ... as well as military new retirement system ... middle class savings all tied up in 401ks
4765 2018-12-21 22:09:44 I LOVE it. Clear two OF spot (doesn't have to mean Harper, but makes it a realistic option). Frees up 20+M this season and stocks farm for potential trade.
4766 2018-12-21 22:09:28 @jimcramer I think you need to talk to your peers on fast money. They’re talking about driving stocks to zero. It’s getting seriously ridiculous.
4767 2018-12-21 22:08:52 Yes, to a degree because of pensions and 401K's, but the richest 10 percent own 84 percent of all stocks.
4768 2018-12-21 22:08:49 I did think it out. My stocks have greatly, I'm greatly surpassed that under previous administrations.
4769 2018-12-21 22:08:46 Don’t buy any stocks at all!! They live off your money today, while you pray you’ll have more tomorrow. S.C.A.M.
4770 2018-12-21 22:08:31 Highest volume day for stocks since August 2011.
4771 2018-12-21 22:07:48 I'm not invested in defending bump stocks, but changing a legal definition on the fly is unsettling.
4772 2018-12-21 22:07:31 Lot of good stocks to pick from
4773 2018-12-21 22:07:16 Most millennials will be buying bitcoin over gold or any stocks imo

4775 2018-12-21 22:06:48 Anyone look into whether Trump or his cronies are shorting the stock market.  He knows that his crazy crap will tank stocks.
4776 2018-12-21 22:06:30 Create political havoc and he did have option to obtain military spec. Machine guns. The whole issue of bump stocks should never happened. Thanks barak o boo boo.
4777 2018-12-21 22:06:15 Because they sell early and they buy when the stocks go down.

4779 2018-12-21 22:05:52 Bloomberg News: “Barring huge gains during the upcoming holiday period, this will be the worst December for stocks since 1931.”  I wonder if Individual-1 is aware of this.
4780 2018-12-21 22:05:52 OH FUCK MY STOCKS
4781 2018-12-21 22:05:24 Where do I buy Raycon stocks
4782 2018-12-21 22:04:57 True, however I’d rather put my money in stocks. 
4783 2018-12-21 22:04:53 So stocks only go up?
4784 2018-12-21 22:04:32 Just wondering... Did @realDonaldTrump destroy our economy and give tax breaks to the wealthy so he could make a killing picking up stocks cheap right now???? He knows the Dem’s will come along and fix the economy and make his cheap stocks very valuable...
4785 2018-12-21 22:03:52 me, squated on a smooth rock  gnawing on a live fish beside my secret underground pool: what’s stocks, precious?
4786 2018-12-21 22:03:43 I generally trust CNBC because they do well with explaining stocks and trends, but these numbers seem far from accurate. But maybe I could be wrong. I won't know until the data is in front of me and I can do some sort of evaluation and analysis of it
4787 2018-12-21 22:03:40 The Boeing Company (BA) price at close, 2018-12-21, is 305.22. #boeing #stocks #NYSE #space
4788 2018-12-21 22:03:22 As much as understand common perception of issue, bump stocks the product crosses over the reasonable line and factually increases cycle rate and actually requires a level of instability when operating. Idiot ATF should have prevented. The idiot in Vegas new his choice would .
4789 2018-12-21 22:03:05 Still holding ACB, APHA & PYX...starting to add to CND junior energy & mining. Hate to sell off all my weed stocks as the FarmBill will be opening a lot of doors and the state of the markets needs to be ignored - as difficult as it is to do that. Growth industry in its infancy.
4790 2018-12-21 22:02:54 December market volatility is very consistent with one of price-agnostic trading, similar to that which proliferated during the 1920s and 1930s, when stocks and bonds first mass marketed to general public.
4791 2018-12-21 22:02:11 Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) price at close, 2018-12-21, is 319.77. #teslamotors #tesla #stocks #NASDAQ #elonmusk
4792 2018-12-21 22:02:06 If you have a situation where $GS is toxic, like $LEH was, this market is going way way way lower and it hasn't even started. Tons of people still have nice gains. They haven't panicked yet. 

My question is: who are the counter parties? Who is blowing up & driving stocks lower?
4793 2018-12-21 22:01:38 if it is eco-loons.....  can we have some stocks installed in the Gatwick check-in area ?
4794 2018-12-21 22:01:20 . Curious...he referenced "steel stocks" in one of his comments, which caused me to wonder who in his 'circle' bought stock recently in steel industry-including Cons media Talking Heads.... Can't help but think, this' abt someones' enrichment- & I don't mean working folks.
4795 2018-12-21 22:01:18 Don’t buy stocks until you see Dow in the 17k’s...this has been my advice to real money all year. Peter Brandt just confirmed.
4796 2018-12-21 22:01:03 also I am addicted to buying and trading stocks but I don’t think that is necessarily a bad thing as long as I don’t go overboard :)
4797 2018-12-21 22:00:57 Honestly love having 3 stocks it makes me 100% less stressed when I lose a stock now
4798 2018-12-21 22:00:55 Increased $VT to ~6.0% of assets, and $AMZN to 8% of single stocks (~2.4% of assets). Didn't expect the selloff to go this far, so most of my cash is sitting outside my brokerage, and I was mainly buying with fund distributions here. Bummer. Cash and bonds are still 8% of assets.
4799 2018-12-21 22:00:50 Let it crash. I don't make my money on stocks.  My investments are for long term and and not need for daily neccessary items.
4800 2018-12-21 22:00:44 A lot of right wing pundits are explaining away the bear market by saying "only the wealthy are in the market." 

First off that's wrong. Almost 50% of the country holds their own mutual funds/stocks in some form

Second of all, your future pensions are all invested in the market

4806 2018-12-21 21:59:52 So talking Current events are talking about going door to door to confiscate all bump stocks (against Constitution) and passing and trying to enforce an EX POST FACTO law that makes something done in the past, illegal when it occurred-> is also prohibited by US Constitution
4807 2018-12-21 21:59:33 Who jumped ship on their stocks?
4808 2018-12-21 21:59:32 I'm sorry. That's terrible. I think once Trump is gone and things stabilize, stocks will recover. 
4809 2018-12-21 21:59:31 Stocks are based on future prospects. When there is uncertainty that's when they drop. They have steady dropped since it started looking clear congess was gone.
4810 2018-12-21 21:59:15 So. Usually presidents dont have that much of an effect on stocks. Do I become a hypocrite if I just pin the slidw on Trump. Because he's inept as hell. Staggeringly inept in ways I never thought possible.
4811 2018-12-21 21:59:05 No we may not. Automatic weapons are not banned, as long as it was made before '86 and you get a tax stamp. Bump stocks do not convert semis into autos. Bump fired weapons are still semis. The stock allows you to pull the trigger much faster.
4812 2018-12-21 21:58:46 Wall Street stocks suffer worst week in a decade how’s your little friend Donnie feeling now ..................
4813 2018-12-21 21:58:31 I think, but am not certain, that the selling concentrates in big U.S. stocks because that is where you can get out the door fastest and this has all the earmarks of forced liquidations or planned liquefactions by yearend. 3/3
4814 2018-12-21 21:58:04 Stocks!
4815 2018-12-21 21:58:01 17 investigations, shutdown looming, stocks in free fall, yeah, winning. 
4816 2018-12-21 21:57:44 Not too surprising. Many of the tech companies are actually now global utilities, not growth stocks - and, as worldwide regulation looms, they should be valued on much lower P/Es.
4817 2018-12-21 21:57:32 We're not seeing a profit from our stocks because DONALD TRUMP KILLS EVERYTHING HE TOUCHES.
Jesus. Get a clue will ya?
4818 2018-12-21 21:57:24 @federalreserve  We are hurt and  need Powell to take a look in the mirrow and do the right thing . Stock markets dropped 20% b/c of him. Individual stocks dropped 30 40 50%
4819 2018-12-21 21:57:18 @realDonaldTrump Let's see if I got this right. Stocks are in the . Your top military advisor QUIT over leaving a vacuum in Syria by pulling our troops out. YOU are causing a govt. shutdown and YOUR Republican Senate can't stop it...and YOU'RE going to Mari Lago
4820 2018-12-21 21:56:48 Took profits on all positions today at market close. Not looking to hold over the holiday. Total weekly return on portfolio was 57.63% not a bad week in the market. #money #investing #stocks
4821 2018-12-21 21:56:46 one of my roommates is also gonna play stocks with me so i’m not alone ahsjdkkd and he comes from a family of accountants so here we goooo
4822 2018-12-21 21:56:37 Trump legalizes hemp, bans bump stocks, and pulls out of Syria?? I think some ghosts of Christmas must have visited him. The wall ghost is still to come probs...
4823 2018-12-21 21:56:25 I bought my first stocks for my retirement  last month. I’m the king of good timing.
4824 2018-12-21 21:56:16 I've had a lot of fast games in Ultimate tbh, stocks are consistently ending pre 120 and its amazing
4825 2018-12-21 21:55:43 Stocks fall sharply; Nasdaq confirms bear market
4826 2018-12-21 21:55:43 That's awesome. We have only like 2 acre. But I'd definitely farm a third for animal feed. We have ducks and chickens. I could dry and use the stocks too. 
I thought people had to have 10 acres farmed. This is good to to hear.
4827 2018-12-21 21:55:05 hey look, stocks are on sale in time for Christmas!
4828 2018-12-21 21:53:41 Thankful to be learning from the best of the best in penny stocks trading. In this bloody market I was still able to turn $250 profit today while only investing $800. Thanks @timothysykes for teaching me your strategies!!!
4829 2018-12-21 21:53:07 I have not looked at his financial stmts. Does.donny own any stocks
4830 2018-12-21 21:52:58 Yes I do. I use to make stocks, and or soups, chilli. Yes Ive read about baking bread in a dutch oven. I think someone needs to make bread for you again.
4831 2018-12-21 21:52:57 Bump stocks are banned but still humans are still uncontrollable.
4832 2018-12-21 21:52:23 Buy blue chip stocks now
4833 2018-12-21 21:52:19 sure glad financial ghouls swindled institutions into backing pensions with stocks and then replacing new pensions with 401k.

I'm convinced 401k exist to individually internalize the inability to retire rather than anger towards corporations & the state.
4834 2018-12-21 21:51:50 #TermLimits, Req'd to live 6 mos every year in district represented; Same healthcare, costs as constituents; No smash and grab legislative action; tighter ethical review of accumulated compensation (stocks, speaking and book bonuses); No compensated lobbying 6 years after office.
4835 2018-12-21 21:51:33 when i get my scholarship funds for the next semester in a month i think i’m gonna finally play stocks i’ve been practicing with like fake money on programs and it’s time for me to actually invest
4836 2018-12-21 21:51:12 Hi  mark @ari5000 what about me? The comment stands and I would suggest very accurate. Some good buying opportunity for long term investors now. Some more panic to come tho. Ride it down with puts on index and accumulate growth stocks.
4837 2018-12-21 21:51:06 It’s hard for me bc every fiber in my being wants to get fuckin long(er) all my favorite stocks that have crashed but I’d rather buy em +5% off the bottom than get run over   (more).
4838 2018-12-21 21:51:04 Speaking of train wrecks -- all three major indexes are down sharply more than 10% in December 2018. Through Thursday, the Dow had lost 1,240 points this week and 2,679 points in December. Stocks are on pace for the worst December since the Great Depression.
4839 2018-12-21 21:51:03 yeah man it fucking sucked shit. Van Gogh? more like van blows. Jackson pollock? more like jackoff potluck. matisse? more like matisn't
4840 2018-12-21 21:50:35 These are the 1 stocks in finance sector that yesterday hit all-time highs:
$TIBR
4841 2018-12-21 21:50:30 Actually good news for younger working Americans. Low unemployment means people working and adding to their 401k’s while stocks are at low prices ..... good way to build wealth.
4842 2018-12-21 21:50:18 Also missing is the opportunity cost...had they invested in something of value: themself, real estate, business, and stocks.. they're forgoing interest, capital gains, multiple income.... costing them millions in the long run
4843 2018-12-21 21:50:17 Stocks suffer worst week in a decade....thanks dum dum Donald time for you to own up to it
4844 2018-12-21 21:49:51 I’m about to go off on people who keep voicing their opinions on bump stocks but don’t know the difference between semi-auto, full auto and how a bump stock works.
4845 2018-12-21 21:49:25 Exactly my plan.  Especially with the stocks that have been around for more than 50 years.

Like Ford, GE, and the likes.
4846 2018-12-21 21:49:08 Ok well bump stocks and bump stocks alone and nothing else I think is a valid exception. That’s where we disagree. End of argument.
4847 2018-12-21 21:49:04 BREAKING NEWS
Stocks fell sharply again. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is down over 20 percent from its peak, entering a bear market, an ominous milestone.
Friday, December 21, 2018 4:04 PM EST -- new york times
4848 2018-12-21 21:49:02 Was up 3 stocks to 1 against a casual friend in Ultimate and he told me to stop hitting him so I timed him out
4849 2018-12-21 21:48:49 Stocks in a bear market? I believe funds will move into Crypto.
Is this the silver lining we Av been waiting for in crypto?
4850 2018-12-21 21:48:35 Wall Street promotes higher interest rates and later cashing out stocks for a scapegoat !!
4851 2018-12-21 21:48:35 Interesting. Obama could've banned bump stocks, but he didn't. Blame him for the shooting. 

Btw, bump stocks don't do what you think they do.
4852 2018-12-21 21:48:29 Yeah. Remember, if the gov't only gets involved by cutting rates, just remember how effective that was in 2000 and 2007. Or buys stocks, look how effective for Nikkei.

But it's always a fear of mine, so I keep my positions small.
4853 2018-12-21 21:48:23 do ALL little macs play with 2 stocks???
4854 2018-12-21 21:48:12 Within days of Trump winning the election I met with my IRA guy and put in automatic sell orders if my stocks reached a certain point. I'm too old to try to rebuild what took a lifetime to save. So far two stocks have sold.
4855 2018-12-21 21:48:00 Stocks down again today. 1930's, here we come. Hope people have room to grow their own food.
4856 2018-12-21 21:47:43 Not if they've been trading puts. Money can be made if stocks go up or down. Depends on the trade during what time period, especially if you have inside knowledge of when a bad or unpopular event will happen (even though under some, but not all, circumstances, it may be illegal).
4857 2018-12-21 21:47:30 He 100% gets lots of shit done.
Admirable almost. I'm excited to read his "art of the deal" but I'm trying to figure out his angle.

Peculiar guy. You'd have thought he'd want stocks to have an amazing bullrun under him, no? People would see him as a God if they got rich from it.
4858 2018-12-21 21:47:20 Highly advise you to look elsewhere.  they just had their robot trading system cost me a substantial loss; didn't give me the choice to cash out stocks that would have cost me nothing (green/black) to cover margin.  Furthermore, I got ZERO WARNING. Closing account next week.
4859 2018-12-21 21:47:10 Hey Trump thanks for what your doing with the stocks!!!  I am officially down from 170 a share to 93 bucks in a month flat because of your brilliance.  Oh mighty big brain, biggest of the brains, why don't you take credit for the stocks now big-shot!
4860 2018-12-21 21:46:50 You are neglecting to mention the large number of peasants who are 401K holders who have invested in stocks.
4861 2018-12-21 21:46:45 I had a bunch of cash in my account, which had been there since August. I just used it to pay off debt, and all of a sudden a million companies want to loan me hundreds of thousands of dollars at 0% APR. 

I wonder how much bitcoin and pot stocks I could buy.
4862 2018-12-21 21:46:34 Yes I am... Shirtings stocks right now
4863 2018-12-21 21:46:32 Stocks suffer worse week in a decade. It took Trump two years to break what Obama fixed. #TrumpResign #TrumpShutdown
4864 2018-12-21 21:46:31 Weekly head and shoulders on A LOT of stocks my brother. But yep, it's also on TWTR.
4865 2018-12-21 21:46:15 Stocks suffer worse week in a decade. It took Trump two years to break what Obama fixed. #TrumpResign #TrumpShutdown
4866 2018-12-21 21:46:06 My wife said “Stocks are gonna be on sale next month, honey”. #MrsBrightside
4867 2018-12-21 21:45:56 Stocks fell sharply again. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is down over 20 percent from its peak, entering a bear market, an ominous milestone.
4868 2018-12-21 21:45:52 Wall Street is taking money from over valued stocks !!
4869 2018-12-21 21:45:34 If it weren’t for the bump stocks I would
4870 2018-12-21 21:45:28 our beloved uranium stocks have been scuba diving in volume for years lol
4871 2018-12-21 21:45:23 To me, bump stocks are a toy. A cute little addon so you can pretend you've got an automatic, but not really all that useful. I understand the slippery slope argument, but this in no way impacts 2A and your ability to defend yourself. Banning automatics was a much bigger deal.
4872 2018-12-21 21:44:06 The Dow continues to meltdown.  Stocks seemed to be attempting a comeback in early trading but lost their courage by afternoon.  Stocks ended down 1.8%, 16.3% off the previous High set on Oct. 3rd.  The imminent Gov't Shutdown should finally push the Bear off the ledge
4873 2018-12-21 21:44:05 Aha, welll, we dont advise our clients on cryptocurrency so I'm not even gonna give an opinion on it.  But in reference to stocks, if you have them in something like a 401(k), just weather the storm. We're young, it'll bounce back eventually. It always does.
4874 2018-12-21 21:44:01 Stock Market been tanking ever since the dmn dims took house back over !! Their 401 was done when Obama left !! To begin with stocks is for long  term!!  Hey blame Obama because he said it when everything was gong  great it was because of him so  now its on him  lol
4875 2018-12-21 21:43:49 Tom, if you are managing funds and their bylaws state you must be 50/50 bonds to stocks your stock balance is now only 40%.  They HAVE to buy before the end of the year to balance out.  I am fuessing a big upswing next week.
4876 2018-12-21 21:43:47 So you want everything to burn then? Btc, stocks, debt, housing, other markets
4877 2018-12-21 21:43:32 That's the proof we needed is a vampire : he stocks to much blood in these rounded veins to be completly mortal.
4878 2018-12-21 21:43:31 Play stocks
4879 2018-12-21 21:43:21 U.S. stocks worst week since August 2011,
4880 2018-12-21 21:43:20 As Markets Tumble, Tech Stocks Hit a Rare and Ominous Milestone
4881 2018-12-21 21:42:28 So let’s get this straight @realDonaldTrump if in 90 days you unconstitutional order to ban bump stocks makes anyone who owns one without even actually owning the firearm just the part is a felon and could spend 10 yrs in prison.
4882 2018-12-21 21:42:10 @Mgoodwin4 because MM not gonna hold stocks over the holidays and a lot of selling for tax purposes. I still feel their levels are a gift.
4883 2018-12-21 21:42:02 Buy stocks?
4884 2018-12-21 21:41:54 Mr. Presient. I know you're really busy and I think you're doing a great job but if you get a moment, please look into stopping the short selling of stocks. It can kill good companies. Thanks@realDonaldTrump
4885 2018-12-21 21:41:48 Stocks down yet again worst in a decade. This belongs to you n you alone. Riding Obamas for the 1st 10 months now u own what u did to the economy. Dems n everyone with a brain knew the trickle down effect doesn't work some can learn from past mistakes. Traitor
4886 2018-12-21 21:41:48 Why do you count the parabola from 14,000 and not from 2,700? Serious question, would like to hear your thougths, new to stocks
4887 2018-12-21 21:41:31 ++bump stocks
4888 2018-12-21 21:41:28 Hold on, just by voting out; UK would be worse off and complete crash of stocks, the pound, years of austerity... it lasted a few days before things started to recover, and guess what now the time draws close here we go again! It’s scaremongering at its finest!
4889 2018-12-21 21:41:16 I’m salivating at the prospect of buying stocks on the cheap once the wreckage of the bear market is over. There’s nothing like dirt cheap stocks to make me rejoice. Not there just yet but on the way.
4890 2018-12-21 21:41:06 saw 2 stocks 5 minutes FD only, some people miss Smash 4 way too much
4891 2018-12-21 21:40:49 Stocks plunged again Friday, bringing the Dow Jones Industrial Average's losses for the week to nearly 7 percent and ending its worst week since the financial crisis in 2008. The Nasdaq Index fell into a bear market.
4892 2018-12-21 21:40:40 You’re being presented with a chance to own some great stocks at a discount. Apple for one.
4893 2018-12-21 21:40:39 The only things he wants to do are things other people haven't achieved. That's why bump stocks and CJR. Therefore, important things that already exist will be ignored
4894 2018-12-21 21:40:33 Great time to buy stocks...
4895 2018-12-21 21:40:31 it makes me sad when i lose to someone who plays on 2 stocks
4896 2018-12-21 21:40:16 If you run a short book to hedge out your longs, then you’re doing fine. Bull thesis on stocks has not been negated. Also, the  move today on a number of crosses was very very notable. I didn’t have one dollar/cross position that wasn’t up testing very important levels
4897 2018-12-21 21:39:57 This is is new normal? Good earnings, low inflation, i.e. stocks take a dump? The so-called  'bubble' that was based on good earning and low inflation pops?
4898 2018-12-21 21:39:55 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
4899 2018-12-21 21:39:36 Stocks close down near session lows
4900 2018-12-21 21:39:34 Naaah, Saudis are holding today US stocks...average Americans are deep in debts
4901 2018-12-21 21:39:21 @step2tx @ChristusPatriot @KatTheHammer1 under Obama stocks went up 149% over 8 yrs. under Trump it's up 13% over 2 yrs, lmao.
4902 2018-12-21 21:39:03 @Gbay99 Can you make another stocks video about surviving bear markets? That kind of info is feeling more needed by the day, and all your previous stock videos were about bull makrets
4903 2018-12-21 21:38:45 Trading volume of stocks on the NYSE that fell on Friday exceeded the volume of securities that rose by the second-most ever.
4904 2018-12-21 21:38:34 Worst week for US stocks since August 2011: @business
4905 2018-12-21 21:38:23 And Trump says trade wars will not affect stocks or economy! Surprise!
4906 2018-12-21 21:38:02 The stocks market gets affected every time we have a government shutdown.
This is not good.
62’
4907 2018-12-21 21:37:58 A ban on bump stocks was inevitable,criminal justice reform had been getting worked on for years, and the farm bill isn’t liberal. This argument is pointless and you’re ignorant.
4908 2018-12-21 21:37:42 Hells yeah! That’s why took my 401k OUT of stocks in July...
Missed some upside... but it’s about keeping what I’ve made
4909 2018-12-21 21:37:30 I respectfully disagree with you on the ban on Bump Stocks. It’s a novelty item that does NOT change the firing mechanism. The same thing can be achieved with a belt loop and your thumb. This does nothing but bring us a step closer to eviscerating the 2nd Amendment.
4910 2018-12-21 21:37:20 Why are conservatives suddenly quiet about gun control? That's because Trump BANNED bump stocks.
4911 2018-12-21 21:36:49 If they were close to retirement I’d expect limited exposure to stocks. No?
4912 2018-12-21 21:36:47 What a Christmas on the Stock marked!  Only Grieg Food & JD com in green among my stocks this week  :-/ .... impressing $JD AS Nasdaq drops 4%.
4913 2018-12-21 21:36:44 If you don’t sell, you don’t lose. Economy is strong  and going in the right direction & soon the market will go up. Way up. Stocks are on sale for a limited time only.
4914 2018-12-21 21:36:20 Any strong stocks in this market?
If so, please send them to me.
4915 2018-12-21 21:36:19 Why do individual stocks when you could be a broker? It could be a financial planning equivalent of having a grandparent hand over their iPad to figure out for them. Except with portfolios and a little more of a "Better Call Saul" vibe.
4916 2018-12-21 21:36:10 All 30 Dow stocks were down for the week and month.
4917 2018-12-21 21:36:00 also the call of duty game that was released on their platform by activism on flopped so their stocks crashed even more.... lmao
4918 2018-12-21 21:35:52 Who needs penny stocks when you can buyout magic singles?
4919 2018-12-21 21:35:45 More ominous signs for U.S. investors and the global economic outlook:
—Worst week for the Dow Jones Industrial Average since October 2008
—Worst week for the tech-heavy Nasdaq since November 2008
—341 S&P 500 stocks have fallen more than 20 percent from their recent highs

@CNBC
4920 2018-12-21 21:35:36 MARKETS: Tech slide pulls stocks down, finishing a rough week. Dow closes off over 410 pts, NASDAQ drops 195 pts and is officially in a bear market.
4921 2018-12-21 21:35:25 My stocks are in shambles.....
4922 2018-12-21 21:35:12 @ChristusPatriot no Hun. An unstable President is causing this. The Fed did a friggin 1/4%. That took stocks down 300 pts. The rest on Trump
4923 2018-12-21 21:35:11 Great time to Buy Stocks!
4924 2018-12-21 21:34:37 It’s not about “essential.” Never has been. I think bump stocks are a cheap and stupid gimmick but I’m all for people having them. Own what you want to own so long as you don’t hurt anyone. We aren’t responsible for the small percentage that does bad things.
4925 2018-12-21 21:34:35 this will be the worst December for stocks since the 1930s.
4926 2018-12-21 21:34:33 Another trimming of the DOW, S&P and NASDAQ
The worst week for stocks since October 2011
Investors alone are creating a bear market
4927 2018-12-21 21:34:31 Alone try to watch you tube Tim Sykes and others learn a bit seems they want you to jump in they take profit leaves you holding the bag.9th grade education mom passed in 75 on my own at 15 made six figures for several years so I don’t consider myself stupid just in stocks
4928 2018-12-21 21:34:11 Bump Stocks should be no different than Lisc full auto weapons. They do not serve a purpose for hunting or self protection. I have a CC & carry
4929 2018-12-21 21:33:50 Nine stocks in the S&P 500 were up this week, including AIG and GE.
4930 2018-12-21 21:33:48 The last time markets had a week like this was 2008 as the nation hurtled into the Great Recession. 
The last time stocks had a December like this was 1931.
4931 2018-12-21 21:33:47 it’s not just OW. they just basically officially gave up on a game last week (heroes of the storm) by moving a lot of their development team off of it. and that diablo mobile announcement hit their stocks really hard hahaha
4932 2018-12-21 21:33:23 I'm almost burned out with my Barbatos BBQ Party. 111 kills, my QP stocks have recovered, 100K+ bond acquired, and enough gears to cover my immediate concerns with some surplus. I'm done, goodnight. #FGO
4933 2018-12-21 21:33:20 Get her stocks for the same price. She’ll grow out of that skirt and it’ll be gone before she realizes she even had it.
4934 2018-12-21 21:33:01 Yep Obama was given 0% interest and $5T of stimulus money. Thus you only had one option, stocks. Trump is normalizing the markets, banks bonds paying interest, banks charging for loans. Investment options like a real market!
4935 2018-12-21 21:32:54 Actually kids texting at the dinner table should be put in stocks, it's really annoying.
4936 2018-12-21 21:32:51 Stocks plunged again on Friday, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average to its worst week since the financial crisis in 2008, down nearly 7 percent.
4937 2018-12-21 21:32:45 This is bullshit. Mutual funds are made up of stocks. People’s 401k funds are in stocks. I’m frugal and have invested my money for decades because it’s the only way left to build a nest egg. I’m not some cigar-chomping fat cat.
4938 2018-12-21 21:32:45 Dang, the FAANG stocks were down 5.5 percent just today.
4939 2018-12-21 21:32:35 @realDonaldTrump Mr. un-president. Stocks fell again today. Thanks so much for your stunning lack of leadership.
4940 2018-12-21 21:32:27 US stocks suffer worst week in a decade.  Tired of Trump’s winning yet?
4941 2018-12-21 21:32:11 As stocks fall, valuations fall. Toss in higher borrowing costs and tariffs expenses...if something doesn’t change soon, jobs will be cut to improve productivity and profits. Trickle-down works both ways.
4942 2018-12-21 21:32:03 So... all my stocks gunna go to $0 or what?
4943 2018-12-21 21:32:01 Awhile back in the middle of the night congress voted and unilaterally voted to allow congress to insider trade on stocks
 Google can congress insider trade on stockmarket
4944 2018-12-21 21:31:51 Relative to stocks, this is the best year for the Treasury market since 2011.
4945 2018-12-21 21:31:45 This selling and buying back is a "wash sale" and as with stocks the IRS in USA won't allow to use this as a loss.  So if you do it, not on an exchange!
4946 2018-12-21 21:31:41 I bought in 2000, sold my Nortel shares for the down payment. Got nothing but grief about losing all that upside...six months later they were toast.
I always say better a couple of months early than too late in stocks.
4947 2018-12-21 21:31:14 I've been racking my brains thinking of millennial stocks to buy but this idea is even better. What stocks do we own to take advantage of boomers torching what $ they have left. Cruise ship companies seem an obvious choice.
4948 2018-12-21 21:31:12 OMG. "Investors fear a recession is coming, and barring huge gains during the upcoming holiday period, when trading is usually quiet, this will be the worst December for stocks since the 1930s."
4949 2018-12-21 21:31:09 Our businesses are having to purchase extra stocks to secure themselves against the possibility of No Deal, in the knowledge that a sudden departure from the Customs Union would cause chaos at our borders for months. But all these keyboard experts think they know better...
4950 2018-12-21 21:30:57 But they do. Show me where bump stocks hold the same factual truth. I have a CC and carry a .380
4951 2018-12-21 21:30:57 @Senate @Congress @SenMajLdr @SpeakerRyan @WhiteHouse @POTUS @GOP No Adult Running The White House! Generals Quit! Trump Listens To Fox Cable News Personalities! Shutting Down Government! With Draws Troops, Wants A Wall, Stocks At Lowest In 10 Years! All On Trump!
4952 2018-12-21 21:30:49 Does the Trump admin actually want stocks to collapse?! This was too stupid to be just stupid. There is a calculation I am not getting.
4953 2018-12-21 21:30:46 Evening Market Wrap-up: stocks end the worst week since 2008 amid a possible government shutdown and global economic concerns all ahead of the Christmas holiday period.
4954 2018-12-21 21:30:34 I picked a really bad year to start buying stocks 
4955 2018-12-21 21:30:11 Stocks are down, good gov officials are quitting, hate crimes are up, other nations think we're a joke, Russia has the red carpet rolled out to hack us again, healthcare is evaporating and international trade is a complete mess. THANK YOU TRUMP VOTERS!
4956 2018-12-21 21:30:06 I sold all my stocks sometime in APRIL. Lucky me. Now only thing remaining is my Job.
4957 2018-12-21 21:30:01 Technology stocks tumbled shaved 3% off the Nasdaq index into near territory 
4958 2018-12-21 21:29:51 Now aren't you delighted to have moved into gold and cash back when the DOW was 26,000 and the NASDAQ was climbing into the heavents? And everyone was telling you tech stocks, like real estate in the 1970s had no place to go but up?
4959 2018-12-21 21:29:50 Technology stocks tumbled shaved 3% off the Nasdaq index into near territory 
4960 2018-12-21 21:29:49 Stocks and shares is no joke. In one month I’ve lost £700 
4961 2018-12-21 21:29:46 This makes no sense...."Democrats" have stocks too dont you think?? 
4962 2018-12-21 21:29:06 @realDonaldTrump so you said we would be winning. Stocks go up we thank you. Stocks go down we say F-you.. Dow's worst week since 2008 financial crisis; Nasdaq closes in bear market.. you must be tired of winning. Dumba$$!!
4963 2018-12-21 21:29:00 Come on, who’s really surprised that stocks tanked? The fact that the best use they found for the tax break money was $1.1T in stock buybacks should have told you something. 
4964 2018-12-21 21:28:33 The last time markets had a week like this was 2008 as the nation hurtled into the Great Recession. 
The last time stocks had a December like this was 1931.
4965 2018-12-21 21:28:11 I can't stress that enough. The stocks will recover. Just ride it out. Because it's going to get worse.
4966 2018-12-21 21:28:06 Love it when the last month of the year I lose all the money I made in stocks over the previous 11 months. Yay.
4967 2018-12-21 21:27:52 We got rid of the Tyburn tree and the stocks. It was a start. I wasn't about in the war years, but it gave us character. Infiltrators mustn't be allowed to erode it. Nor poorly trained kids eating at a family dinner while texting.
4968 2018-12-21 21:27:49 Anyone who believes the stock market was going to keep climbing are fools .it went up to fast for to long moved all my higher risk stocks over a year ago my 401 is doing just fine I'll give it 6 months to a year then I'll put it back buy low sell high
4969 2018-12-21 21:27:46 My dm disguised a mimic as a supreme health potion...my character compulsively stocks up on potions. I felt so betrayed.

I’d be a doorknob mimic though. Or a cell phone.
4970 2018-12-21 21:27:02 May we agree that fully automatic weapons are generally banned from civilian ownership, with a few exceptions? Bump stocks de facto convert legal rifles into automatic weapons. I think Trump’s action enforces existing Federal laws.
4971 2018-12-21 21:26:59 Obama's started 20th of January 2009. Right in the thick of it, jackass or moron. He inherited a mess and tried his best to fix it. Trump so happens to come into the ass-end of the longest bull run & gets blamed for QE. Independent institution buying stocks..
4972 2018-12-21 21:26:54 Bottom line, is a buyers market for Stocks is what is happening, and that has major potential to make a lot of people really rich, really fast.
4973 2018-12-21 21:26:54 by taking it to those FANG stocks he’s really owning the libs
4974 2018-12-21 21:26:48 Two things. As a father of a son who is deployed, how is leaving Syria a bad thing? And I still don't get how a rate hike, helping savers, is bad. Other than some of us have another option other than stocks. And Hollywood?
4975 2018-12-21 21:26:29 Look @realDonaldTrump beat Obama again.  The worst week for stocks in over a decade. WINNING!
4976 2018-12-21 21:26:25 Markets Right Now: Stocks end miserable week down 7 percent
4977 2018-12-21 21:26:18 When the stocks come back up, you won't see any MSM.
4978 2018-12-21 21:26:04 Very happy I cashed in my stocks last week. Very.
4979 2018-12-21 21:25:58 BREAKING: Stocks plunge more than 400 points as #CriminalDonald’s acting Attorney General tries to obliterate the rule of law while Trump’s irrational behavior forces US government shutdown and Mattis resignation in wake of Trump’s dumb Libya debacle sparks foreign policy crisis.
4980 2018-12-21 21:25:51 U.S. stocks close far lower again Friday 12/21/18 $DJIA -1.81% (-414.2) at 22,445.37, $SPX -2.06% (-50.8) at 2,416.58, $COMPQ -2.99% (-195.4) at 6,332.99.
4981 2018-12-21 21:25:41 You know something else that amazes me is you think he is so great for business, why aren't all these great Trade Agreements he said were going to happen haven't and why didn't we get more business investments after the Tax Plan...they just bought their stocks back. #Bankruptcy
4982 2018-12-21 21:25:36 the US managed to convince itself that it has the best intentions for the kurdish people in the face of turkey. or at least thats what i make of it 
and yknow, caring about stocks
4983 2018-12-21 21:25:23 I know Trump says it’s his shutdown. With the Nasdaq down 20%, is it his bear market too? How are the coal stocks doing?
4984 2018-12-21 21:24:53 ONLY if you dont own stocks, there are people losing their minds looking at their holdings
4985 2018-12-21 21:24:36 It is winning to the wealthy. They get to buy up stocks on the cheap.
4986 2018-12-21 21:24:35 Netflix is -42% from its 52 wk high. All FAANG stocks have plummeted.
4987 2018-12-21 21:24:30 The people rich enough to buy and hold stocks have lost money. Money they can probably afford to lose.
4988 2018-12-21 21:24:29 I don't think so. Thankful to have seen this coming and sold a good chunk before stocks started heading south. I'd guess there's more to come as global economy softens and US debt, political instability both soar.
4989 2018-12-21 21:24:28 $SPXS for the next few days is a no-brainer.

4991 2018-12-21 21:24:20 Thank you 
Sadly I can’t say the same about those with 401(K)’s and various company stocks.
4992 2018-12-21 21:24:03 Stocks - Dow Ends Brutal Week Deeply in Red Amid Government Shutdown Fears
4993 2018-12-21 21:23:41 -Stocks closed out their worst week since August 2011
-Mattis quit after Trump called for Syria pullout
-Trump is acting crazy with our national security
-Trump is trying hard to shut down the government

It's time for the 25th Amendment. #TrumpResign #TrumpShutdown
4994 2018-12-21 21:23:20 @Senate @Congress Calling Home Troops Now Wants To Call Afghanistan Troops Home! Against Generals Wishes! Shutting Down The USA Government All On Trump! Stocks At The Lowest In 10 Years! Since GW Bush Stocks Crash! All On Trump! Time For: 25th. Amendment! OUT OF CONTROL TRUMP!
4995 2018-12-21 21:23:20 Bank stocks are like rat poison...
4996 2018-12-21 21:23:13 Can't imagine why when the president and the Fed are in alternate realities. Thus is where puts on stocks save one's butt
4997 2018-12-21 21:23:12 Stocks are down breaking records. Mattis quit because of trump. The ACA is the law of the land. Mueller isn’t finished so YOU have NO idea. Only trump people have been locked up.
4998 2018-12-21 21:22:47 "Stocks fell sharply again. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is down over 20 percent from its peak, entering a bear market, an ominous milestone." Dump Trump before it's too late.

5000 2018-12-21 21:22:42 Not quite...

A Theory:
Money gets dumped into stock market...

Stock market gets inflated artificially.

Stocks make money.

Cash out on stocks.

Take gains and fuel wall campaign.

Stock market plummets.

???

Skim money off top during construction?

Win?
5001 2018-12-21 21:22:38 Keep going with that shit down while stocks are tanking. Won’t be long before even the rich come after you!
5002 2018-12-21 21:22:35 If only someone had warned us about Trump and stocks.
5003 2018-12-21 21:22:35 You’re too late start buying stocks
5004 2018-12-21 21:22:01  #Stocks  again as #Dow -414pts to 22445 (-4378 in 10weeks) 4  Nasdaq -195 to 6333. WORSE Week in 10yrs. DEPRESSION!
5005 2018-12-21 21:21:56 @garyvee stocks tumbled again. It’s coming man. I couldn’t agree more with the meltdown you’ve been calling. I saw this coming Jan 2018.
5006 2018-12-21 21:21:55 Assembling parts into whole models encompass statistical challenges. Whether a disease is truly absent, or present, and uncounted, bedevils much data. Mathematical models used to turn available data into assessment of stocks, or abundance may misbehave.
5007 2018-12-21 21:21:34 It's the Democrats fault, believe me!  They are stealing stocks and making the very good trump market sink to make me look bad. Unfair!
5008 2018-12-21 21:21:27 @TheLastLeg the people that are causing the Gatwick problem should be put in stocks at the entrance and not allowed to move #lastleg #gatwickchaos
5009 2018-12-21 21:21:15 Two stocks hit new 52-week highs today on the NYSE.

1,027 stocks hit new 52-week lows.
5010 2018-12-21 21:21:07 Owami found her esibhedlela seGwanda, hurry there while stocks last!
5011 2018-12-21 21:20:53 Dow has its worst week since 2008.  Do you realize how healthy your portfolio would be if you had bought a lot of stocks in 2008? If you don't need the money in the short term, you love major dips like these.
5012 2018-12-21 21:20:30 Ok so do you think fully automatic weapons should be completely legalized? If yes you’re insane and if no you probably shouldn’t want bump stocks legal either. I’m pro 2nd but ya gotta draw a line somewhere.
5013 2018-12-21 21:20:10 Gold stocks
5014 2018-12-21 21:20:07 I'm a pretty simple guy, but I just can't understand Santoli on CNBC:

"Amazon was down 5.7% because somebody just desperately needed to puke out big stocks" $AMZN
5015 2018-12-21 21:20:06 I'd pick 18 so I'd be away from home and not have to explain to my parents how I knew exactly which stocks to buy, which foods to avoid, and why I wasn't dating Donna any more.
5016 2018-12-21 21:19:56 Well, stay the course is the assumption. Violate that and we’re having a different discussion. And this is separate from short-term spending needs or a cash reserve.  But these sims do model $50k+ a year of withdrawals meaning sometimes selling stocks at losses
5017 2018-12-21 21:19:46 @GOP @realDonaldTrump Stocks had the worst week in a decade. & you are either shutting down or spending on the stupid wall. Did you learn nothing at the midterms? Do your jobs - work with Congress across party lines for an adult compromise. No wall! No #TrumpShutDown
5018 2018-12-21 21:19:33 Stocks worst week in 10 years. Thanks @realDonaldTrump
5019 2018-12-21 21:19:31 Technology companies are dragging stocks into an ominous territory that the market hasn’t seen in nearly a decade: a severe decline known as a bear market.
5020 2018-12-21 21:19:31 stocks are obviously trading like the euro banking crisis is here and going to be coming to resolution very soon...financials are really amazing
5021 2018-12-21 21:19:30 Worst December for stocks since the Great Depression!

5022 2018-12-21 21:19:01 Just got to dad's place. Fox News is on, he's smoking like a chimney, stocks are down, and my period started the minute I walked in.
5023 2018-12-21 21:18:51 Not sure why a government shutdown would alter stocks prices?
5024 2018-12-21 21:18:50 Facebook has nothing of value but users information to fulfill their legal obligation to make stockholders money, CHOSING stocks, rather than smarts, to build a company
5025 2018-12-21 21:18:22 Actually, only a little more than half of Americans own any stocks, so nearly half lost nothing. Many of the rest don't own much, and the top 10% of earners own about 84% of all stocks. So most Americans probably did not lose 10% of their savings. But lots of affluent folks did.
5026 2018-12-21 21:18:04 You have stocks? When did you become a man of business?
5027 2018-12-21 21:17:59 U.S. stocks suffer worst week in a decade.
5028 2018-12-21 21:17:39 Bear markets return stocks to their rightful owners.
5029 2018-12-21 21:17:33 @realDonaldTrump #rememberWhen you tweeted that the president should be impeached if the #StockMarket drops 1000 points in two days? Happened twice in last two weeks. Why aren't you #impeached? Please #ResignTrump.   #stocks #stockstowatch #Impeachment #401k #401ks
5030 2018-12-21 21:17:24 Technology companies are dragging stocks into an ominous territory that the market hasn’t seen in nearly a decade: a severe decline known as a bear market.
5031 2018-12-21 21:17:17 "During the two previous bear markets, the Federal Reserve acted quickly to stimulate the economy by slashing interest rates. Investors came to believe that corporate profits would recover and dove back into stocks"
5032 2018-12-21 21:17:15 Stocks fell sharply again. The tech-heavy NASDAQ is down over 20% from its peak, entering a bear Market, an ominous milestone
5033 2018-12-21 21:17:10 Dow posted their worst week since 2008. Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index & Dow are on track for their worst Decembers since 1931, during the Great Depression.
Technology stocks dragged the Nasdaq into bear market territory, which is a 20 percent drop from its high. #TrumpResign
5034 2018-12-21 21:17:07 Top 10% of Americans own 81% of the stocks.

Next 10% own 11%.

Bottom 80% own only 8%.
5035 2018-12-21 21:17:00 @realDonaldTrump How’s the Dow Jones Index today? I’d check myself on my stocks app, but it keeps crashing 
5036 2018-12-21 21:16:49 Stocks just dropping like flies.
5037 2018-12-21 21:16:46 "When stocks slump, chief executives slow investment in new projects and avoid decisions that investors might decide are too risky, which can dampen economic growth"

FAANG stocks were again wreaking havoc on the Nasdaq. Google parent Alphabet was down 3%, Amazon down nearly 6%, Facebook down more than 6%, Netflix 5.5% and Apple was in the red less than 2%. 
from @washingtonpost
5042 2018-12-21 21:16:08 Is it something like half of Americans own stocks via some vehicle or another? That should mean that people should care. But only the wealthiest 10% of Americans own around 90% of the value. So who really cares is a different question.
5043 2018-12-21 21:15:59 Just sell all the stocks and see what happens
5044 2018-12-21 21:15:39 Observation of the Day.. when Republicans have the majority .. the stock market soars.. however, when Democrats win back the house, the stock market tanks. Is there a lesson to be learned?  Meanwhile it will be a lean Christmas for some. Way to go Dems! #stocks @chuckschumer
5045 2018-12-21 21:15:34 Warren hate tech stocks again? $AAPL
5046 2018-12-21 21:15:29 The market does not sell off, it trades down. Every share 'sold' on a day like this is bought by someone else (or an algorithm). So either those someone elses and algorithms are like, really dumb, or maybe they are waiting for this opportunity. #stocks
5047 2018-12-21 21:15:23 I remember Trump tweeting that stocks would take a big hit if Democrats won the House or Senate.  Guess he was right again.    He usually is.
5048 2018-12-21 21:14:46 Stocks will never rally again in our life time.
5049 2018-12-21 21:14:41 Guess you are still far better off in stocks and FANG then crypto LOL

Remember when the Democrats tried to enforce the Emollients Clause and the GOP did absolutely NOTHING to help?!?

5055 2018-12-21 21:13:56 STOCK MARKET NOSEDIVE: The Dow is on track for its worst week since the   2008 financial crisis & its worst December since the Great  Depression.  Stocks fell sharply this afternoon on fears that Trump will  force a government shutdown  over the border wall.  #TrumpResign
5056 2018-12-21 21:13:54 Je soupçonne en effet une commande insoupçonnée et discrète... Genre NIS America qui fait du retirage pour regarnir ses stocks.
5057 2018-12-21 21:13:53 And the tech stocks are leading us into a bear market. Worst December in a decade. Way to go POTUS.
5058 2018-12-21 21:13:46 How was banning bump stocks dumb as fuck?
5059 2018-12-21 21:13:41 Translation:  U.S. stocks suffer worst week since George W. Bush was in office and are just now starting to reflect Trump's economy.
Sincerely, #ThanksObama, it was nice for a while.
5060 2018-12-21 21:13:41 "Bear markets in stocks are rare but have the power to spread gloom through the economy. In the last 20 years, there have only been two, one that began with the financial crisis in 2007, and the other that started with the dot-com bust in 2000"

5062 2018-12-21 21:13:28 I'm literally afraid to look to see how much I've lost in stocks just this week alone. Between that and the very real possibility of going thru the holidays without a paycheck, this isn't looking to be a very merry xmas. Not effing merry at all. #TrumpResign

5071 2018-12-21 21:12:08 Trump Administration considering price controls on stocks.
5072 2018-12-21 21:12:07 No you have not. But you have done more damage to the US Economy. Stocks falling heavily, pessimism about your economic strategy or lack of it. A pointless tariff war. A tax giveaway that will never pay for itself.  An Administration that is full of amateurs and crumbling.
5073 2018-12-21 21:11:54 With google stock ending below 10000 today, how long before Amazon drops to below 1000? Will it be this year or next.  Merry Christmas to the people who shorted these stocks in 2018. They are the heroes the corporations do not want..
5074 2018-12-21 21:11:48 Taking some time off but couldn’t help keeping an eye on Wall Street. @CNBC  reports markets at lowest level since Oct 2008.  A couple of green arrows from Atlanta-area stocks @CocaCola, @SouthernCompany among them today.
5075 2018-12-21 21:11:45 On leave. Gin stocks good thanks to @craftginclub - see you in 2019!
5076 2018-12-21 21:11:36 Worst week for stocks in a decade, Supreme Court blocks Trump on immigration, the Defense Secretary resigns, Trump's crooked "charity" shuttered, looming #TrumpShutdown ...  Merry Christmas, Mr. President.
5077 2018-12-21 21:11:32 "technology companies are dragging stocks into an ominous territory that investors have not seen in nearly a decade, a severe decline known as a bear market"
5078 2018-12-21 21:11:31 I vote for corporations. I want my pot stocks to get high AF.
5079 2018-12-21 21:11:05 @realDonaldTrump US STOCKS SUFFER WORST WEEK IN A DECADE! YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL YOU ARE DOING!
5080 2018-12-21 21:10:59 STOCK MARKET NOSEDIVE: The Dow is on track for its worst week since the  2008 financial crisis & its worst December since the Great Depression.  Stocks fell sharply this afternoon on fears that Trump will force a government shutdown  over the border wall.
5081 2018-12-21 21:10:57 "Lost a large % of their savings this year." After a nearly 10yr rally of >300%, does that statement truly reflect the impact of a 9.4% YTD decline in the S&P. Does any reasonable person believe every gain in stocks is locked in and that any downgrade is an unacceptable loss?
5082 2018-12-21 21:10:51 So much winning.
"STOCK MARKET NOSEDIVE: Dow on track for worst week since 2008 financial crisis, and worst December since Great Depression. After a rally this a.m., stocks fell sharply this p.m. on fears that @realdonaldtrump will force a govt shutdown over his border wall."
5083 2018-12-21 21:10:36 I made two small update beyond the current mix of 401k contribution.  Put minimum requirements for VTINX and VUSTX. My hope is at least they don’t go down in value versus leaving it cash or in stocks oriented mutual funds.
5084 2018-12-21 21:10:35 It's shocking but stocks sometimes actually go down. Hard to believe I know.
5085 2018-12-21 21:10:31 Bow-wow-wow Yippee-yow Yippee-ya, Bow-wow Yippee-yow Yippee-ya!!  What a sell off day. Stocks are on sale.
5086 2018-12-21 21:09:58 Stocks are down today. Again!
5087 2018-12-21 21:09:58 I had sold earlier at $5.57, so that was spaced out sufficiently, plus I was buying lots of stocks at the end of the day with the market tanking. Plus NBEV is cheap and I still don't have many shares.
5088 2018-12-21 21:09:57 oh no not the stocks let me check all the many Stocks i own
5089 2018-12-21 21:09:52 This will end up a Fed induced recession. Stocks terrible will inhibit last minute Christmas shopping, which will cause weak December retail sales, which will cause more market sell off, which will cause a recession. Thanks Powell.
5090 2018-12-21 21:09:50 Trump is ruining my stocks and i’m not happy about it. Wtf dude stop doing shit
5091 2018-12-21 21:09:49 BREAKING NEWS: Stocks are falling faster than Santa going down a chimney lathered in vaseline. Market down 7 percent this week - Worst weekly numbers since August 2011 #chsnews
5092 2018-12-21 21:09:43 Stocks just finished their worst week since the mega-meltdown under George W. Bush. Do @foxnews viewers know what is happening? Are they being told the magnitude of this? Or is it "look at this shiny object! Gingerbread cookies are MEN! Santa is WHITE!"
5093 2018-12-21 21:09:39 U.S. stocks slumped at the end of a punishing week, leaving the Nasdaq Composite in a bear market for the first time since the financial crisis
5094 2018-12-21 21:09:37 Nasdaq composite's 20% decline qualifies it for bear market. But many of the previous tech titan stocks are down more. Bear mkt and correction teams are a bit less relevant given the extent of the prolonged rise in stocks after the 2010 low for the Dow of 6547.
5095 2018-12-21 21:09:34 Stocks have the worst week in a decade...What timing! #HappyHolidays
5096 2018-12-21 21:09:34 the next step for airlines is to introduce a “basic basic economy” fare where the caveat is that they put you in the stocks and all the other passengers board while pelting you with rotten fruit and chanting “SHAME SHAME SHAME”
5097 2018-12-21 21:09:31 I'm really surprised The Koch's aren't just a little upset. Guess they have enough money and don't care about the price of their stocks.
5098 2018-12-21 21:09:24 I do appreciate starting my first venture in owning stocks, and then having Trump tank the economy.
5099 2018-12-21 21:09:20 The worst week for stocks in more than seven years. #winning
5100 2018-12-21 21:09:20 Federal law defines a machine gun as “any weapon which shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot, automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.”

Bump stocks do not fall under this definition. Try reading.
5101 2018-12-21 21:08:54 $zyne oversold. All pot stocks are way oversold. Loading up

5104 2018-12-21 21:08:39 This is more like townspeople in colonial times jeering the criminal in the stocks.
5105 2018-12-21 21:08:36 Buy when stocks are on sale.
5106 2018-12-21 21:08:34 Stocks bad again
5107 2018-12-21 21:08:30 Never has a Defense Sec. resigned in Protest. 
Trump throwing the west wing and the country into chaos.Shutdown looms, Stocks plunge. We need an intervention or a resignation.

5109 2018-12-21 21:08:14 Best thing you can do this weekend is make a list of 5-10 stocks that if someone told you the market was going to bottom over the next week or two, you'd most want to be long. Look for relative strength. Old leaders does not equal new leaders.
5110 2018-12-21 21:08:13 Thank God I pulled my 401K out of stocks in late Feb. I thought the free fall would occur mid-2017--got out then, got back in to make a little, and sitting it out now until at least Nov. 2020.
5111 2018-12-21 21:08:12 STOCKS down another $414! 
SO MUCH WINNING!

5112 2018-12-21 21:08:06 Tough week for all my stocks and bonds!

5115 2018-12-21 21:07:52 Stocks go down today worse than a decade. The Dump Decline!
5116 2018-12-21 21:07:48 US Small Cap Stocks are now negative since the start of the Trump presidency. Small business has suffered while the rich corporations have benefited the most. We need subsidies for the small indies or limits on monopolies!
5117 2018-12-21 21:07:41 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS U.S. stocks suffer worst week in a decade.  What's your spin on this one?

5122 2018-12-21 21:07:23 STOCK MARKET NOSEDIVE: Dow is on track for its worst week since 2008 financial crisis,and its worst December since the Great Depression.

After a rally this morning, stocks fell sharply this afternoon on fears that Pres. Trump will force a government shutdown over the border wall.
5128 2018-12-21 21:06:48 Well, the ‘why are stocks holding up so well under Trump?’ puzzle seems to be resolving.

After a rally this morning, stocks fell sharply this afternoon on fears that Pres. Trump will force a government shutdown over the border wall.
5130 2018-12-21 21:06:45 got into stocks mainly because of you. right now break even kinda
5131 2018-12-21 21:06:35 Simply put, the market got assholed today. 
  So very many were expecting a bounce today. Hope they covered their positions.
 Stocks have been going up so long it's difficult for people to think they won't bounce. It's short every rip now
5132 2018-12-21 21:06:14 Stocks down again over 422 points, worst year in over a decade #TrumpResign . He own the shut down, the poor markets, everyone retiring, or plain quitting his corrupt administration.

5134 2018-12-21 21:05:57 @realDonaldTrump - Stocks are having their worst week in a decade. So much winning.
5135 2018-12-21 21:05:55 Perfect way to celebrate the anniversary of the Tax Cut which Mnuchin and so many others said would so EASILY pay for itself and propel our nation to even more economic greatness. (Of course figured companies would prop up their stocks with windfall savings.)
5136 2018-12-21 21:05:40 Terrible week in stocks
5137 2018-12-21 21:05:36 Bonds are under performing compared to stocks.

5139 2018-12-21 21:05:08 @TeamCavuto  The rate hikes are the culprit. Let's stop pretending we don't know this is the culprit. Been around stocks 50 years and that's the way it is. Shutdown or China won't move stocks like this.
5140 2018-12-21 21:04:58 No bottom is not confirmed , when people are asking its not the bottom , likely 2288 from my charts , but thats in a good scenario , with stocks crashing noone knows but 3200 will be touched again
5141 2018-12-21 21:04:47 Stocks with the worst week in a decade - let’s see how Trump blames Obama for it.
5142 2018-12-21 21:04:27 Bear market (stocks going down) in anticipation of new House of Rep in 2019? Imagine that.
5143 2018-12-21 21:04:12 U.S. stocks suffer worst week in a decade. Thanks Trump.
5144 2018-12-21 21:03:24 US #Stocks close lower for their 7th straight day of losses

5146 2018-12-21 21:02:11 #Equity markets really getting hammered into the Christmas weekend.

Bounce into January imo. Fear is at fever pitch & this move is overextended.

#stocks
5147 2018-12-21 21:01:58 Trump is hurting my stocks. I wish he would sit down somewhere with these #moneygames.
5148 2018-12-21 21:01:56 Most of the multiple bagging stocks don’t pay dividends. They continue to multiply with introduction of one and then making it progressive. 

Now I require two or three of these for 2019 
5149 2018-12-21 21:01:17 Awesome with $GSAT saving the rest of my stocks lately and im most heavy in this one into profits up 9.38% today
5150 2018-12-21 21:01:12 Stocks are falling, so the Fed increases interest rates for the SOLE purpose of being able to drop rates to "prime the pump" in the case of a recession. I swear these economists nowadays are fucking idiots.
5151 2018-12-21 21:01:10 #stocks wow people laugh and post “well we can only
Go down 400-500 pts for another 40-50 trading days -thinking its gonna slow up. This is insane. Feels like an orderly crash
5152 2018-12-21 21:01:04 Of all the damn stocks I own, only Walmart finished in the green. Unbelievable
5153 2018-12-21 21:00:59 stocks are OG bitcoin nothing will convince me otherwise
5154 2018-12-21 21:00:55 Apple stock reached its all time high just over 3 months ago. Today it dropped to a 52-week low.

Stocks are too volatile for me.
5155 2018-12-21 21:00:27 In Switzerland I hear them recommending quality stocks.
5156 2018-12-21 21:00:27 The ultimate scam is being told that because stocks are lower they are better value..ie nothing else has changed.
5157 2018-12-21 21:00:14 Did you see that the 2018 Bill has been signed? Did you see that Hemp is now Legalized for American Farmers to grow. Do you realize what that means for Hemp Stocks...Buy some now and get in on the New Years money maker...
5158 2018-12-21 20:59:55 Percentage of stocks over their 40 dma is now down to 5.8%

5160 2018-12-21 20:59:36 @ReShapeLifesci is there any hope with the company I own 20,000 stocks and I lost all my life savings any hope ?
5161 2018-12-21 20:59:31 how about sign the bill to make bump stocks legal since you said no destruction to our 2nd ammendmant rights...
5162 2018-12-21 20:59:15 Why does it look like the stocks are crashing? Apple, Ford, FB, and Amazon are hitting the lowest they’ve had all year. Yikes!
5163 2018-12-21 20:59:04 So that’s 2 against the orange buffoon.

I don’t see why bump stocks are such a big deal when it’s easy af to get real trigger packages.
5164 2018-12-21 20:58:57 Only 60 secs left to puke stocks, hurry
5165 2018-12-21 20:58:26 ((hugs)) That's so sweet of you, hwit dear! 
Great choices...esp that malt! Hope you have plenty of stocks in for the festive season! xxx
5166 2018-12-21 20:58:15 Once you get the hang of the trends n actually do the research these penny stocks make for a nice consistent little come up 
5167 2018-12-21 20:58:05 What an amazing day in the markets. My only 2 Long positions are green $CANN.c +7% & $NOU.v +6% and I made a killing on my $SPY puts  Enjoy the weekend ! #stocks #investing
5168 2018-12-21 20:57:57 Just only $1649.95! Buy more, save more! The reality poor performance meets the rip-off. Not surprised Nvidia stocks go bottom rock.

5170 2018-12-21 20:57:40 Ummm what’s the point of speaking to the nation now???? The right thing?what that stocks go down? 20% ago maybe but now? 
5171 2018-12-21 20:56:46 $DBVT ending the day with vertical as well!

What an awesome day with so many strong runners!
Got to love it!
These stocks are like Market crashing? Oops didn't notice!
5172 2018-12-21 20:56:40 More bailouts for those wealthy enough to own stocks in a meaningful way. Sounds great. To ME. But, maybe not to most.
5173 2018-12-21 20:56:32 When will those investing in stocks stop expecting the Fed to come to their rescue when markets go down.  Artificially repressed interest rates, massive accumulation of government debt, and a government that spends beyond our means - that’s the problem- not the fed.
5174 2018-12-21 20:56:14 If anyone needs to buy stocks, I'd say they'll be super cheap in about 2-3 weeks. We should be down to around 20,000 points for the DJIA by then.
5175 2018-12-21 20:56:05 Where was he diverted to. It seems to me that all UK airports will have to invest in technology that defeats drones otherwise this will happen repeatedly. If they find the culprit - they need to be sorted in some way - put them in the stocks?
5176 2018-12-21 20:55:35 Democrats are somehow manipulating the selling of stocks, and depressing the DOW!
5177 2018-12-21 20:55:33 WHAT LITTLE U PEOPLE TRULY KNOW ABOUT WHATS COMING N TRUMP N THE IMF WROTE THE ADVANCE PLAYS! BRING IN THE NEW BANKING SYSTEM (QFS) N (GCR)! DUMP UR STOCKS N BUY T BILLS N BONDS! HAHAHAHAHA!
5178 2018-12-21 20:55:29 Alright...so since stocks ain’t making me much money these days. 

Time for these championship NFL fantasy matchups coming up Sunday to give me the cash for some Christmas presents 
5179 2018-12-21 20:55:18 80% of the stocks I'm following have had yearly lows this month.
5180 2018-12-21 20:55:04 .@realDonaldTrump Dont cave on wall funding, shut it down and let it stay down! Please don’t make another foolish decision like banning bump stocks! Your supporters had your back, you better have ours.
5181 2018-12-21 20:55:03 Drink kool aid and buy stocks because no one else is.
5182 2018-12-21 20:55:01 Going into my Stocks app and seeing that Nike is the only default stock displayed that isn't in a total free fall is pretty funny in light of all the events of the past year.
5183 2018-12-21 20:54:53 But muh stocks! Muh stocks! Imagine how bad this year would have been if companies hadn’t mortgaged their futures buying back their own stock. Now it’s just going to be much, much worse long term.
5184 2018-12-21 20:54:49 In principal, with those exclusions, I'd be in favour.
But part of the system of punishment is the rehabilitation element, and like stocks and shares, past performance doesn't necessarily have a bearing on the future.
I'd prefer MPs/councillors being recallable between elections.
5185 2018-12-21 20:54:43 Isn't he the same guy that went on the @TODAYshow show around 10 years ago and told #America "sell all your stocks now!" As I recall that was the bottom
5186 2018-12-21 20:54:25 This is one of those days where you need to remind yourself that stocks do not go to zero. But this market is complete shit!
5187 2018-12-21 20:54:10 (Marc Maron LOCK THE GATES voice) - "SELL THE STOCKS"
5188 2018-12-21 20:54:06 Simple. Stocks go down too
5189 2018-12-21 20:54:00 @MysteryTrader99 Thank you for your charts. I was a bit late getting 100% into cash but got out of all my stocks last week.
5190 2018-12-21 20:53:53 $BTC REMEMBER....BTC is correlated w/Stocks and usually lags.    R 4200 (pretty firm for now) S = 3750 (Breaks that) we see 3600. Net net ....a re-test backward from the rally off $3125...SHOULD stop and hold around 3530 (61.8% fib) or a re-test of 3125 is in order. Not advice
5191 2018-12-21 20:53:46 Trump got bump stocks banned where is his Thank You...
5192 2018-12-21 20:53:38 2018 was already a year of MSFT, quietly. Overtook Apple (briefly) in market cap, stock bucked the general trends while other tech stocks were in free-fall etc. They're not heavily consumer-facing anymore so they'll never get the "Year of Microsoft" headlines.
5193 2018-12-21 20:53:28 I did this with a couple handfuls of Microsoft stocks in 2004 that my grandpa gifted me... he and my dad both couldn’t believe I’d do that, and they also wouldn’t help with college shit. COOL GUYS COOL.
5194 2018-12-21 20:53:18 Lack of a good bounce here leads me to believe nobody is covering shorts  #stocks
5195 2018-12-21 20:53:12 Anyone with money in stocks knows where the fear is coming from having a Democrat getting ready to take over the money it's only the gullible will believe that garbage there spewing

5199 2018-12-21 20:52:40 Let's see, if I were'nt BROKE p paying property tax bills-I'd buy up some of these bargain stocks like XOM $68, Dollar tree $83 & Master card.  Markets r bouncing!

Are they tired of all that WINNING that trump was saying that would happen & how Mexico was paying for that wall that trump promised at every rally going ?
Wake up folks, trump is a crook and a liar, & the worst dealmaker ever
5201 2018-12-21 20:52:08 even the feds misjudged the market panic. i thought all those factors were already priced in the oversold stocks. Anyway, we live to trade another day.
5202 2018-12-21 20:51:49 Hey,give Wilbur a break. He probably just forgot that he was supposed to sell those stocks. Hell, he’s probably lucky if he remembers to put pants on in the morning.
5203 2018-12-21 20:51:47 My stock portfolio took a hit today. So pissed. #stocks #investing #dowjones #markets
5204 2018-12-21 20:51:42 Best wishes back especially hopes for the new year as I just lost $30,000 on your stocks
5205 2018-12-21 20:51:37 He's an investor in private prison stocks. Makes sense.
5206 2018-12-21 20:50:52 in pot stocks?
5207 2018-12-21 20:50:51 one day in: my stocks are fucking failing fuck
5208 2018-12-21 20:50:50 People getting out before the holiday, because it's only going to get worse. Bet there are a lot of redemptions. The hot growth stocks selling off could mean redemptions, margin calls, or trying to shore up the bottom line for the year.
5209 2018-12-21 20:50:45 It is actually a good buying opportunity for those looking to buy certain individual stocks. $TWTR id down 19% this week!
5210 2018-12-21 20:50:26 It's not too late to buy gold stocks! 
5211 2018-12-21 20:50:19 Also if this year finishes negative which seems inevitable, it will be the first negative year since 2008.

So while conservatives raged about how terrible economy was under Obama there was no negative year for stocks on his watch.
5212 2018-12-21 20:50:19 You can go college do a flipping masters and still don't know crap about making money on the stock market. So much for education in this country? If we understood the power of stocks, we would not be puzzled about the PM house and how he financied it.
5213 2018-12-21 20:50:12 The NRA & trumps base are livid that trump gave in to the Never Again kids & signed that bill banning bump stocks. Fuck them both!!! HAHAHAHA hahahaha
5214 2018-12-21 20:50:11 Oh, but tRump lies all the time. He has told over 7,000 lies. I try to look for things #45 has done that have been good and so far I found just one: the ban on bump stocks.
5215 2018-12-21 20:49:55 Meh. What are the Dems going to do to fix it? Only half the country owns stocks anyway.
5216 2018-12-21 20:49:55 I heard he recently sold off loads of WWE stocks to reboot the XFL lol, my dude really believes
5217 2018-12-21 20:49:53 @realDonaldTrump STOCKS!!  Tell us about how great you’re doing!  Stocks are crashing!  You’ve turned a good economy into a bear market in less than two years!  YOU ARE FREAKING CLUELESS!!!!!!
5218 2018-12-21 20:49:33 I LOVE this way of thinking about  stocks 
5219 2018-12-21 20:49:16 Good thing I don't own any stocks or I'd be freaking.
5220 2018-12-21 20:48:58 Facebook stocks deserve to crater.
5221 2018-12-21 20:48:48 Have to keep fueling the military industrial complex. Got to keep those Raytheon stocks from dipping too low. Please...
5222 2018-12-21 20:48:48 Industrial Hemp legalized
Report on School Safety
Criminal Justice reform
Out of Syria
Potentially getting out of Afganistan and Yemen
Potential funding for wall

Other than the executive order ban on bump stocks, this is the best week of @POTUS so far! #AmericaFirst #MAGA
5223 2018-12-21 20:48:47 It's correcting. Believe it or not stocks have been overvalued for a while.
5224 2018-12-21 20:48:46 My stocks 
5225 2018-12-21 20:48:41 Was doing some late game shopping today. I found some good sales on stocks.  A shiny new ETF under the tree! 
5226 2018-12-21 20:48:18 All the stocks are a 52 week low and I just wanna buy so many stocks rn while they’re cheap but I have no money 
5227 2018-12-21 20:48:10 One word. Trump. Stocks like stability.
5228 2018-12-21 20:47:37 You can't afford stocks anyways you were just shit canned
5229 2018-12-21 20:47:23 Tax Loss selling today? Great Christmas gifts' prices today ... added some more HEMP's stocks myself $UBQU $HEMP $HIPH $ISOLF $CVSI $HMPQ $WDRP $SIPC $VATE ...
5230 2018-12-21 20:47:20 Stocks are crashing
5231 2018-12-21 20:47:05 Everyday I look at the Dow and Nasdaq. And I can only imagine how bad my stocks are . Hopefully, eventually it will go up . When ? I don’t know
5232 2018-12-21 20:46:53 skirt around anyone else-- but he /does/ want to wear the skirt. He wants to wear it in the safety of his room, while he's reading, or-- maybe while he stocks up on Crofter's. But he doesn't want anyone else to see.

This was a poor choice. He shouldn't have given in to his -
5233 2018-12-21 20:46:37 Stocks are dropping. Now how long until Trump loses GOP support?
5234 2018-12-21 20:46:35 Tradenet and TEFS is only good for shorting hard to borrow stocks. Save $2k and trade direct market.
5235 2018-12-21 20:46:31 @SenToomey @LindseyGrahamSC @ChuckGrassley @senatemajldr #stocks 

The market tanks again today. Tech bleeding out. You might as well have put you retirement money into a sock and buried it. But big business loves Loves LOVES it's tax breaks.

@gop bastards have fucked us bigly
5236 2018-12-21 20:46:30 $OGEN $MICT $NVCN Bounce These Three Know how to End the Week!!

5237 2018-12-21 20:46:24 Has anyone explored which of their donors was in the construction business or had stock in it, in 2013, and, who may no longer be on Trump’s bid list?  After they all made money in healthcare stocks from their ACA vote,  I tend to follow the money.
5238 2018-12-21 20:45:51 stocks that looked "Pricey" are starting to look "Juicy" having cash on the sidelines is a great way to make money in a nutty market like this.
5239 2018-12-21 20:45:49 Amazing seeing so many stocks hit 52 week record lows. The market compellrley imploded , all while the housing rates increased .25% overnight. This doesn’t look good...
5240 2018-12-21 20:45:42 Because you're going to go brown paper with ribbons style this year for a less-plastic Christmas? Or get #HerMajesty to oblige with the potato print option suggested earlier? I don't think I'll be getting any more when I get through my current stocks unless it's plastic free 
5241 2018-12-21 20:45:35 I don't know about y'all, but I just bought myself more stocks at a steep discount for Christmas. 

If you're a trader, you should've been out of the way a while ago.

If you're an investor, here are the lower prices you were begging for the last few years.
5242 2018-12-21 20:45:16 Ah, yeah, if part of DCA then not market timing...if coming from rainy day fund then market timing...but even with DCA you can use trend/value/carry/vol, etc. to inform which asset to buy (stocks or bonds).
5243 2018-12-21 20:45:15 Buy the dip? #stocks #StockMarket #markets

5245 2018-12-21 20:45:14 Are you implying the tech companies are deli berating tanking their stocks... Just to spite trump?
5246 2018-12-21 20:44:35 “Stocks plunged again on Friday, bringing the Dow Jones Industrial Average's losses for the week to 6.7 percent, putting it on track for its worst week since the financial crisis in 2008. “
5247 2018-12-21 20:44:32 Looking at the US markets I may well be doing some Christmas stock market shopping on Monday morning . I've explained to  during his captivity that Christmas is actually all about giving things away - including stocks - and the penny has now dropped. You're welcome.
5248 2018-12-21 20:44:31 Stocks are reflecting what happens when the country is run by an ignorant who believes knows everything, surrounded by yes sir people as clueless as he is.
5249 2018-12-21 20:44:25 Stock Market down again today, Glad I pulled out my stocks yesterday!

5253 2018-12-21 20:43:37 You know what, stocks are taking a hit, it’s not Donald Trump‘s fault and you should make that clear. It’s totally reasonable for him to request money for the wall, the Fed has had as much or influence on the market and I don’t hear you making that clear to the American people.
5254 2018-12-21 20:43:34 Apparently it would have been quite better to enter the U market now with this horrible November and December in mind  most of my U stocks have turned red. I have patience though and will not sell any..
5255 2018-12-21 20:43:11 almost as confident as Doug kass screaming to short the S&P about every week, then covering at the top two months ago and loading up on bank stocks long. I assume he'll be closing his 2nd hedge fund since 2014. he's been destroyed
5256 2018-12-21 20:43:03 Ever wonder who scoops up all those stocks when the market drops. Those who wait on bargains increase in  earthly power and wealth. A lot of stock is being Bought.
5257 2018-12-21 20:42:57 My 401k is doing so badly it is now a 201J. #stocks
5258 2018-12-21 20:42:35 Stocks are doing so bad I had to uninstall robinhood just so I dont do anything stupid lmao
5259 2018-12-21 20:42:31 Hey can you resign so my 401k and stocks can recover?
5260 2018-12-21 20:42:20 “Stocks plunged again on Friday, bringing the Dow Jones Industrial Average's losses for the week to 6.7 percent, putting it on track for its worst week since the financial crisis in 2008. “
5261 2018-12-21 20:42:14 At what point do you start adding to some of these stocks getting crushed in the market right now... $FB at a 52 week low. Not sure how much "blood in the streets" it takes to start buying.
5262 2018-12-21 20:42:06 Maybe he's shorting the markets, or at least some stocks and some index etfs (like SPY, etc.)

1. Short the market 
2. Create chaos 
3. Get millions.
5263 2018-12-21 20:41:23 Who stocks it?
5264 2018-12-21 20:41:18 Seeing some mkt people calling for st bounce but it’s hard to see it coming #stocks
5265 2018-12-21 20:41:15 FYI-Last 2 days, Trin Index been under 1. means they buying this meltdown or not panicy yet. Guess what? that fact is REALLY BAD. Stocks could collapse further next week and I think they will. I am in great shape this year. +30%!  Let the mkt set up for an easier trade Not advice
5266 2018-12-21 20:41:02 This bear has been so vicious and quick. I mean, a lot of stocks have already lost 30-50% of their value in a very short period of time.
5267 2018-12-21 20:40:56 This sort of thing happens all the time when such a large portion of your net worth is in stocks.
5268 2018-12-21 20:40:33 Just checked my stocks and 401K ..... 

I was told my stocks can be transferred into a few Starbucks gift cards and my 401K is now a 201K ....   <sigh>
5269 2018-12-21 20:40:30 Stock market coming down to our expected 2,400 S&P 500 support.  Square $SQ coming into buy range as well.  We have various stocks we are looking at that is showing relative strength.

5271 2018-12-21 20:40:27 My dad tried to invest in stocks for 20 years.  

After 20 years, he figures he broke even, and told me not to bother unless you're already a millionaire.
5272 2018-12-21 20:40:22 December is the worst month for stocks since 2008.
5273 2018-12-21 20:39:53 All I can say, is it would be nice if people were consistent, when it comes to caring Where's our hard earned taxpayer money goes.  We just went further in debt, (borrowing more from China) so that rich corporations, could buy back their own stocks and get richer. Yay for us all!
5274 2018-12-21 20:39:51 Good lad. There’s always time to replenish depleted stocks of Christmas booze.
5275 2018-12-21 20:39:23 Maybe he's shorting the markets, or at least some stocks. 

Short the market, then create chaos. Get millions.
5276 2018-12-21 20:39:15 Weak Fridays for stocks, especially below key levels, carry more meaning than other moves. Seen any weak Fridays lately? ...probably nothing... Happy dip buying!

5278 2018-12-21 20:38:58 and liquidity is so bad now, lot of mid cap stocks i follow just get really crushed on little volume - easy to move stocks a lot in this time period
5279 2018-12-21 20:38:55 Few people care about bump stocks and whether or not they are banned. It's the precedent. What other accessories will be banned next? Since no mods are needed to bump fire, will they use the same reasons to ban all semi-autos later? The antis are in it for the long haul.
5280 2018-12-21 20:38:54 our system will always be a mess in the current form, up or down.

my point is that stocks going only up isn't some nirvana

5285 2018-12-21 20:37:52 Message from dumbo, "2019 is going to be a fantastic year.  Economy will slow down.  Home prices will go down, and the rich will be able to buy back the stocks very cheaply again when the sp500 goes back to 666.  I will make the stock market cheap again.  Merry Xmas.  Ho Ho Ho"

5287 2018-12-21 20:37:26 When The Stock Market Tanks, Alcohol Sales Go Up. Maybe Buy Alcohol Stocks ? 
5288 2018-12-21 20:37:21 I can’t look at my stocks . Haven’t looked in a while , too scared 
5289 2018-12-21 20:37:19 You don't speak any more about the stocks?   Time ago you was every day speaking about the new highs. What about speaking about the new LOWS?
5290 2018-12-21 20:37:02 2019 is going to be a great year for those buying hemp stocks and crypto. So many catalysts moving forward. #FridayThoughts
5291 2018-12-21 20:36:58 We got here through PDP!...'ce fini! Ask that man selling drinks inside traffic, that woman selling roasted corn, that lady hawking boiled groundnuts if their stocks are worth 10k.

5297 2018-12-21 20:36:41 I guess no Santa Claus rally this year @CNBC - great call putting people in stocks on every dip!!!
5298 2018-12-21 20:36:38 1/Our 2019 Report went out to subscribers last night. It's the culmination of months of research & analysis. Unfortunately our conclusion is 2019 will likely be unfavorable for Crypto & Stocks. Generally, we don't see signs of a Crypto turn around until mid NOV - JAN 2020.
5299 2018-12-21 20:36:33 You know folks want to just raise cash when stocks, bonds, 10 YR treasuries, and gold are selling off at the same time.
5300 2018-12-21 20:36:33 There was a time when #stocks were bought and sold to help businesses,  now it’s all about raping them for money! #shorts are awful!
5301 2018-12-21 20:36:28 Rev, you still impressed with Kass's buying? I'm impressed about how undisciplined he is. Astonishing losses on his bank stocks. and he bought all the way down. @DougKass
5302 2018-12-21 20:36:28 NASDAQ, tech stocks getting pounded.  Smart money. IMO they should all short each other.
5303 2018-12-21 20:36:21 No your blowing up everyone’s wealth, worst wek for stocks in 10 years.
5304 2018-12-21 20:36:16 I know it’s yesterday’s news considering Mattis’ resignation, but banning bump stocks sets a horrible precedent for future presidents on what can or can’t be ‘banned’.
5305 2018-12-21 20:35:25 And it's 4 stocks lol
5306 2018-12-21 20:34:49 Surprised $tlt not moving inversely to stocks.

5308 2018-12-21 20:34:23 Stocks are getting absolutely obliterated today...What’s next??
5309 2018-12-21 20:34:22 I might be wrong but unlike suppressors and pre 1986? full auto,  owning a new full auto requires you to be a gun manufacturer ($200 a year, if it laps you must turn-in or destroy full autos)  also the items themselves need a serial, which bump-stocks have none.
5310 2018-12-21 20:33:35 So stocks are down 380 Pt’s, Mattis outta here, and we’re gonna shut down the Gov. Hey all my Rep. friends you broke it, now how will you fix it?? Asking for 300 million Americans #trumpshutdown #MattisResignation
5311 2018-12-21 20:32:22 Stocks or digital assets?
5312 2018-12-21 20:32:18 Safe to say my stocks aren’t doing that good. Hoping for a big 2019 rebound

5315 2018-12-21 20:31:31 Of course when you stimulate it with 1.34 TRILLION dollars it will boom! Unfortunately they bought their stocks back and now like squirrels hiding their money! Trickle down failure again! Rich get richer!
5316 2018-12-21 20:31:25 investment advisors are 3x levered to stocks. personal investments, firm revenue, and firm valuation all go down the drain in a big sell-off
5317 2018-12-21 20:31:08 I’m in bottom 1% (almost) but we got tax break too. And grateful. 14,000 jobs lost not good BUT gained hundreds of thousands overall. Stock market is an emotional game played by the rich. We have two stocks in a small ira, ATT and UPS. period. Doing fine.
5318 2018-12-21 20:30:41 Oh boy - U.S. STOCKS EXTEND FALL, NASDAQ DOWN 3.01 PCT. Happy Friday. @AftertheBell
5319 2018-12-21 20:30:40 everything dead. There is NO where to hide.

5320 2018-12-21 20:30:13 I looks like @realDonaldTrump is true to his #PromisesMadePromisesKept by promising to run the #USA like one of his businesses. #Stocks crashing and #deficit ballooning. Just like all his other businesses. #MAGA? #FridayThoughts #TrumpResign #TrumpShutdown

Oh let’s not forget about tomorrow’s pop up party need to come in at 5 rather to start stocks and soups. Roasting and peeling 10cs of tomatoes for sauces.......
5325 2018-12-21 20:29:22 Yep. All cash for me until these stocks are marked down even more!
5326 2018-12-21 20:29:13 What a disaster of a month for stocks! Agree with the thought that this is partially due to the political uncertainty and its decision making.  Low confidence!
5327 2018-12-21 20:29:05 Since 1950, the S&P 500 in a midterm year has pulled back an average of 16.9%. BUT, from the closing low in a midterm year, a year later stocks have been higher the last 17 out of 17 times. -- From @LPLResearch
5328 2018-12-21 20:28:53 In the US, it's basically taxed as Stocks, which is ok if your just an investor but where it gets messed up is if you actually wanted to use it as currency, you will have to pay tax on all the little purchases
5329 2018-12-21 20:28:50 What platform you using? Robinhood banned me from buying til next month  I been missing out on some stocks I been watching.
5330 2018-12-21 20:28:49 Damnnnnn my stocks are failing

5334 2018-12-21 20:27:57 Damn skippy, I'm racking up on my Utility stocks lol
5335 2018-12-21 20:26:41 Sometimes I think this is an alternate reality and we’re all going to wake up in 2016 again. At this point, can we just wake up? I need my stocks to go back up, my friends to be working, and a less volatile country.
5336 2018-12-21 20:26:20 how this person nearly donates more a month than pays in rent is astounding, homie gotta be living in nebraska just rolling in dough trading stocks all day
5337 2018-12-21 20:25:48 Since you expect others to prognosticate perfectly, you must be great at it.  You must be rich from your stocks and whatnot, then, right?

5338 2018-12-21 20:25:41 Remember when stocks rallied 1/2 Thousand points the minute after @realDonaldTrump tweeted about that 90 day extension?  What a bunch of mooks for believing anything out of his pie hoie...
5339 2018-12-21 20:25:16 Woke up somber about finishing another great film & going to miss my art team. Then I bought 33 stocks  updated my website. Started a social media campaign to release my new film on 12/30. Doing props & set dress for a web series in ATL in January. I'm moving on #IndieFilm
5340 2018-12-21 20:25:08 Of course you are, and you’re probably rich. How’s those stocks? #FucktheRich
5341 2018-12-21 20:24:48 Remember that stocks often look cheap all the way down, and expensive all the way up. In particular on a standard 12 month forward PE basis.
5342 2018-12-21 20:24:35 Stocks go up and down only a fool doesn’t diversify to minimize loss ...  however loss is a great thing especially for taxes  and btw stocks should be your disposable income you don’t mind winning or sometimes lose

5350 2018-12-21 20:22:29 @AliVelshi  Hello Ali. Long time fan, first tweet tho.  I wonder if @realDonaldTrump is manipulating the market intentionally. It makes me wonder what stocks are being sold short and who it impacts in his inner circle.  Just a thought. Thanks for your work and insight.  David
5351 2018-12-21 20:22:02 sold my $HY for a small gain.  Not a whole lot of up stocks in the first place. Maybe rebuy 20% lower.

5353 2018-12-21 20:21:52 Donnie Pullout, your timing is very bad, stocks crashing, gov shutdown,  GOP declining support, all these negative waves
5354 2018-12-21 20:21:46 There is never a bad time to invest in stocks as long as the fundamentals are inline
5355 2018-12-21 20:21:18 you can call your investment advisor to see whats going on with stocks... but they have likely checked out for the holidays.... THX for the fees!
5356 2018-12-21 20:21:17 #PCSTip: Avoid shipping extremely valuable items (stocks, jewelry, coins, gold bullion, documents) or identify high-value items on the inventory.
5357 2018-12-21 20:20:53 If hadnt banned bump stocks you would still crying. We will see if your lack of consideration for the Bill of Rights holds up in the courts.
5358 2018-12-21 20:20:46 Stocks are braking records , Mattis retired after killing Isis , Wall is commin' baby , Obomacare is historey , Muller witch hunt proven to be phoney , Democrates about to get locked up in Gitmo ! Yea your doing real dam good ! Lmao

5362 2018-12-21 20:19:39 So today wud b a good day to start buying stocks on margin eh? #pillowbiter
5363 2018-12-21 20:19:28 richest 10% own 84% of stocks, therefore buying in just got cheaper for the bottom 90%
5364 2018-12-21 20:18:24 We gave you our bump stocks, give us the Wall. It’s called compromise gotta give and take.
5365 2018-12-21 20:17:56 Good summary of stocks to avoid. Maybe @Paydirt_Media can do a historical piece on Okap Ventures?

5369 2018-12-21 20:17:19 Bump stocks being legal will correct the mistaken "compromise" that banned full auto guns manufactured after 1986.  Another compromise where Democrats gave nothing and received  large taking of constitutional rights.

5371 2018-12-21 20:16:26 I'm tempted to get long. But haven't yet.
The only long delta plays are in some long calls far DTE in a few oil stocks.
Next for me might be the same in bank stocks.
5372 2018-12-21 20:16:07 Trump needs to ignore the stock market and focus on the underlying economy and national security. Let the Fed worry about stocks and focus on your key promises.
5373 2018-12-21 20:15:33 Tax loss harvesting = sell stocks/ETFs that are down on year to offset realized gains.
Wash rule = if u rebuy same in next 30 days u can’t book the loss.
Wealthfront strat = Immediately rebuy different product with high correlation to sold one, charge 0.25% management fee.
5374 2018-12-21 20:15:24 Trump also outlawed bump stocks, a more blatantly anti-gun act than anything previous presidents have ever done
5375 2018-12-21 20:15:17 It looks like All the Canadian Recreational Cannabis stocks are headed for zero.
5376 2018-12-21 20:15:10 FUN FACT: Wall Street became associated with business and finance after 24 traders signed an agreement to trade stocks with each other and begin the NYSE Board. The agreement was signed under a buttonwood (sycamore) tree in Wall Street and is known as the Buttonwood Agreement.

5378 2018-12-21 20:14:45 Well the only thing that propelled the market was the windfall of profits from the lack of taxes. Sales however didn't seem to peak. So when what the tax cut geniuses were smoking cleared, stocks tanked.
5379 2018-12-21 20:14:24 Gm, do you trade us stocks or only asx?
5380 2018-12-21 20:14:23 Yes dear, I know. Why does everyone think this is my first rodeo?  Retail will trade, and they'll push stocks up on light volume. That's my prediction.

5392 2018-12-21 20:09:23 Funny how Schumer says the stock market is lower . He’s the one that had inside trading on Facebook stocks .
5393 2018-12-21 20:09:07 man I remember I would get CHOPPED ALL DAY on stocks like $MRIN , @TSXtrad3r has taught me the discipline to wait and hit the RIGHT setups.
5394 2018-12-21 20:08:55 From MarketWatch: “U.S. stocks fall amid escalating worries about a government shutdown.” And I’d feel much safer if the CDC, FDA and FBI weren’t understaffed because of a shutdown. Are those folks seeking asylum scaring you?
5395 2018-12-21 20:08:47 Even with a much shorter time horizon, it's a real good opportunity to buy now. Stocks have been hit so hard, so fast.  And the fact that the bloodletting is happening quickly--versus a slow, painful bleed--is a plus.  It may not yet be at a bottom, but it's probably close.  
5396 2018-12-21 20:08:41 Nike ferait mieux de s’organiser pour avoir les stocks nécessaires pour honorer les commandes des clubs dans des délais acceptables....

5399 2018-12-21 20:08:14 LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Stocks. My Aunt lived across the street when we were growing up.
5400 2018-12-21 20:08:05 I don’t say this often, but Trump actually did a lot of great things this week. He:
-Passed a prison reform bill with bipartisan support
-Banned bump stocks
-Pulled troops out of Syria/Afghanistan 

I don’t like Trump in the slightest but you have to give credit where it’s due.
5401 2018-12-21 20:06:58 You could also buy when the recession happens. Basically a sale on stocks.
5402 2018-12-21 20:06:14 Haha god I love wide wheels, I’m on my stocks right now and I don’t like how it feels
5403 2018-12-21 20:06:00 It's so nice that my company also stocks flavored water in cans so I can  inconspicuously sneak beers early
5404 2018-12-21 20:05:57 There's been a lot of that this past two weeks.  Greenspan said there will be a "rout" in stocks.  Everyone wants to be able to say "I told you so".
5405 2018-12-21 20:05:56 On paper that is true but if we break down each issue (besides Justice reform and bump stocks) it is easy to see why the left is hammering Trump. PS - Trump did receive praise from the left for bump stocks and the crime reform bill.

5408 2018-12-21 20:04:24 Individual stocks or fundamentals don’t matter in this present market.

No winners but short
5409 2018-12-21 20:04:06 That doesn't sound good for stocks... 
5410 2018-12-21 20:04:03 FAANG stocks have still 30% to fall before fair value is reached. For some even more.

5416 2018-12-21 20:01:20 Do you think it's a good idea for someone to buy stocks now if they have excess cash and a 10-year time horizon?
5417 2018-12-21 20:00:27 #QAnon is the Financial Group behind @realDonaldTrump. U.S. Goverment has increased the interests and it will be increase during 2019. The objetive? The Federal Reserve RESET. We'll see a strong capital flight from Stocks MARKETS (#NASDAQ, #SP500, #DOWJONES...).
5418 2018-12-21 20:00:21 I wish they would've sponsored a bill that banned bump stocks, but also repealed the NFA.

5422 2018-12-21 19:59:19 @jimcramer Agreed!It is important to noticed what the implied future curve of a  10y treasury is being priced into stocks today. My math estimates that markets are pricing a 10yT issued in 2020 at over 6%py yield!I  think that is an absurd. It’s time to buy stocks, not sell them!

Frozen pork supplies were down 11% from the previous month but up 1% from last year. Stocks of pork bellies were up 38 from last month and up 5% from last year. (2/2)
5426 2018-12-21 19:58:06 Just wait until there’s a buyback of cheap stocks later! The stocks may be going down now but again wait for the buyback!
5427 2018-12-21 19:57:50 Stocks are down in Canada purely bc we are not attractive to investors. When outside money goes out, the only way govts get paid is with taxes or borrow fr world bank (based on population).So as trudeau spends, the more taxes he will pile on and the more immigrants he will bring.
5428 2018-12-21 19:57:34 You’re still awake! Been watching the stocks falling ay? Nugget.
5429 2018-12-21 19:57:16 In a couple of years lot of people will be regretting not buying stocks today. Valuations are getting real awesome!
5430 2018-12-21 19:56:11 I thought Mexico was gonna pay for the wall? I thought the stocks would hit new highs every day? I though afforadable health care was a priority? I though the swamp would be drained? I though ISIS was gonna be defeated in 39 days? Etc etc etc.
5431 2018-12-21 19:56:03 Only if people did their research instead of listenting to the media and it’s fud. Majority of major stocks have experienced great decrease in 2018.
5432 2018-12-21 19:55:42 iOS 12:  I liked the old Stocks app better. Lost 10yr graph. Fewer visible items in list without scrolling. Redundant info (symbol & co name).  Title bar always two rows and larger than needed.
News drawer always taking up space (should collapse entirely). 

It’s pretty though.

5435 2018-12-21 19:54:23 It is probably best to wait until at least January. Bankers and fund managers are unlikely to be buying stocks the last few days of the year and risk jeopardizing their yearly bonuses the way things are looking right now.
5436 2018-12-21 19:53:23 Try using Dedede Up-B, you have an infinite amount of stocks do you can just spam it without worrying
5437 2018-12-21 19:53:20 Still crazy low compared to most stocks in this range.

5444 2018-12-21 19:50:52 Better to buy in a correction. Right now all the political risk is a drag on stocks, lots of opportunity for political issues to get resolved and cause a snap back rally.
5445 2018-12-21 19:50:35 The Russell 2000 is the stock index of small and mid-cap firms, aka middle America. It peaked at 1742 earlier this year and is now at 1300. It’s 35 points away from erasing the Trump bump. If people don’t want to own these stocks, there’s not much confidence in average America.
5446 2018-12-21 19:50:20 There's a recall on bump stocks...popular among domestic terrorist.
5447 2018-12-21 19:50:08 Just like the best stock market....NOT. Worst year for stocks since 08 as of now. Read again, every Obama year despite the fact that he and dems inherited the worst economy since the Great Depression. Guess when was that 08 crisis created... republicans

5454 2018-12-21 19:48:22 Actually, I'm very much in favor of, for example, the ban on bump stocks that Trump just signed. I had the gun talk with another Liberal friend on Twitter. We were able to come to a real, meaningful consensus on common sense gun control.
5455 2018-12-21 19:48:19 The political leadership in Somalia act like rogue employees in a business who sell the assets and stocks of the company at throw away prices to pocket the proceeds.
5456 2018-12-21 19:48:16 You knew your opinion could move stocks. Never thought your opinion could influence markets? You declared 2 weeks ago that if the Fed raised, would have wished we sold at those levels. Thanks for for setting the stage.
5457 2018-12-21 19:48:12 Hey @realDonaldTrump + enabling @GOP thanks for the worst stock market December since the Great Depression!  Won’t be able to buy a house any time soon w/ our stocks in the toilet! So much winning, you guys! Really remarkable work!
5458 2018-12-21 19:48:10 How many providers were 200% pro-Trump and now so, so silent? He's a great businessman! Look at the stocks going up! He won, get over it!... Trump screwing you and your clients harder than you have ever screwed on your best days. How you like your boy now, ladies?

5460 2018-12-21 19:47:14 If you have any stock market investments hold tight. While the President and his unorthodox behavior are tanking the markets, they want you to sell, so his rich friends can buy up these stocks

5462 2018-12-21 19:47:01 Just a reminder to @SenateGOP that the optics of funding a 5 bil pointless border wall during a recession while ppl are losing jobs and stocks are tanking is not going to be pretty. Hello 2020.
5463 2018-12-21 19:46:54 Cus that's how money is made, you go short on airline stocks, travel companies, long on hotels, defence, carparking eg anti drone etc

5465 2018-12-21 19:46:35 Also by your logic many 2nd amendment supporters would say the same exact logic. Why should they be forced to surrender magazines over 10 rounds or bump stocks simply cause anti 2nd amen folks dont understand? Like seriously you people want your cake and eat it 2?
5466 2018-12-21 19:45:37 A Christmas gift. This is the best time to buy AMD.  I was right about GE and right about AMD the first time. 17.14 is a no brainer. #stocks #stockmarket #ibd #nasdaq #daytrading #AMD $AMD
5467 2018-12-21 19:45:32 Stocks in general are underperforming, with very few notable exceptions
5468 2018-12-21 19:45:19 and equally, 100% of people who started in 2009 don't don't know anything other than easy money and rising stocks...at least until recent.  Extrapolation of trend is common cognitive bias...which is why most miss the turns.
5469 2018-12-21 19:45:04 Fed's want cheaper stocks to buy on the cheap and take credit in getting the market out of Bear phase. More drop to come in 2019
5470 2018-12-21 19:45:04 Should Have Sold Back When We Had 2700+ Dow. So We Have A Roller Coaster Market Where $$$ Is Added To Have A Political End And Not For An Investment Strategy! I Still Like Some Energy Stocks Selling Under Value. Williams WMB Well Managed Co. Around Since 1908. Don't Go Crazy!
5471 2018-12-21 19:45:00 I'm recently (possibly naively, though I thought I was prepared) surprised that not only can he tweet about a thing and stocks tank, but he can make immensely important decisions without need for even a second opinion.

5473 2018-12-21 19:44:42 There goes $SPY to lows...again. Massive positions being liquidated in major stocks relentless selling, 240 before oversold bounce? #deleveraging
5474 2018-12-21 19:44:38 Hate to compare stocks BUT... the way these $KATX shares are getting LOCKED closely resembles $NHPI before it took flight!
5475 2018-12-21 19:44:05 Not in a town with that low of rent unless you're shorting stocks and bliking old people out of their pensions/stealing credit card numbers off the dark web.
5476 2018-12-21 19:43:11 Not necessarily. If you're using their Indexing 2.0 solution and the stocks were all owned individually (rather than the underlying ETFs), there could literally be HUNDREDS of transaction line items. Very time-consuming (and costly?) to pair them by date to search for wash sales?
5477 2018-12-21 19:43:02 Sorry for the confusion, Ty. I did not mean it that way. Am well aware there will only be 1,460 test-group stocks. That's still a very big experiment. And the reach is far broader than the tick pilot, which was confined to fewer securities accounting for far less volume.
5478 2018-12-21 19:42:16 Everytime @realDonaldTrump opens his mouth the markets fall. Thanks dude..you sure are #maga. I just love watching my stocks plummet on a daily basis.  Not really. Shitty person doing a shitty job. Let this nightmare be over soon so we can all get back to some sort of normalcy.
5479 2018-12-21 19:42:08 Comparing BTC to stocks is silly.  Stocks are tied to centralized companies which can fail.  BTC can never die, it's as permanent and resiliant as an idea.  Except it's much more than an idea, it's an actual thing.  It can't be compared to anything because it's unprecedented.

If it were 2 upcross it would kick in full fear mode in stocks. It is losing a bit of steam today tho still in good position to pounce.

5485 2018-12-21 19:39:09 Not sure about the 'false flag' theory, I'd be looking at organisations who would profit from flight cancellations, not much investment needed for a few 'disposable' drones. Might be interesting to see who shorted airline stocks before this event?
5486 2018-12-21 19:38:35 Monetary tighten, economy contracting (their data lags), but stocks and high yield do not, not like this. And there is that Trade War, with each downtick in SPY. China gets more comfy waiting Trump out. Trump had a flawed plan. May have worked under Yellen but he wanted a hawk.
5487 2018-12-21 19:38:01 Then we would be talking about GAF stocks only..
5488 2018-12-21 19:37:45 What stocks should I be buying Erin?
5489 2018-12-21 19:37:37 @EricRWeinstein @benshapiro @jordanbpeterson - some thoughts for those with more knowledge than I. 
- US has a bit of debt, much of it Chinese owned
- most investors diversify 
- Foreigners may purchase stocks
- the trade war has hurt the Chinese economy 
- US market disruption
5490 2018-12-21 19:37:34 Interesting thing about days like today, it is so clear which stocks are being "put up" by insiders.  If this is a bear market, at some point, they will all come tumbling down.
5491 2018-12-21 19:37:28 Wouldn't call it paranoia, call it the anti gunners plan.

I myslef dont own a bumpstock, and if i did then i lost it on a boating trip.  Anti gunners are after stocks, magazines, etc etc. They're already proving that since they cant out right take guns they'll take all the parts
5492 2018-12-21 19:36:39 centrists are very concerned that their defense stocks might go down
5493 2018-12-21 19:36:27 Where have you been. Stocks are on the verge of a recession. I trade stocks. I’m very aware of what the stock market is doing.
5494 2018-12-21 19:36:03 the problem was that corporates took debt for buying stocks buy backs not CAPEX that could increase productivity, they consumed the debt and now they have to pay in a weaker economy, before the leverage problem was in banks now it is in corportes, nothing changed
5495 2018-12-21 19:35:53 The problem with your thesis is that it used to work and you project historical correlations to today's conditions. You are right, in the past a drain in $ liquidity has lead to a rush into $ and US assets. Both US stocks and USTs are down in '18 and there's no bid in sight.
5496 2018-12-21 19:35:48 CUST:"Where's your...?"
ME: "Sold out."
CUST:"Do you have any?"(Crackers/gift bags mostly today) 
ME: Afraid not.
CUST:But it's on the website (toys)

5497 2018-12-21 19:34:53 The economy is NOT the stock market.

They probably want the stocks down so you can buy good old savings bonds and treasuries.
5498 2018-12-21 19:34:23 yes, that's another for sure... low enuf and I like $SQ, I don't yet.  Esp not vs. so many crazily cheap stocks with similar growth.
5499 2018-12-21 19:34:20 Except pot stocks.  Buying pot stock since price came down.
5500 2018-12-21 19:34:01 While #Bitcoin went up to $4k, #Bucharest's stocks market fell again after the #Romanian govt. announces new taxes. For example: "S.N. NUCLEARELECTRICA S.A.     -17,39 %". I think my funds would be safer in #Bitcoin. 
5501 2018-12-21 19:33:59 Stocks may have given up 18 months of gains but my savings account just broke a two handle by a whole 10 basis points. Gotta be like the first time in 9 years I can say that
5502 2018-12-21 19:33:45 @realDonaldTrump @larry_kudlow @KellyannePolls @stevenmnuchin1 @LaraLeaTrump  PLEASE ADDRESS!!! U.S. stocks sank to a 16-month low, with heavy selling in technology shares leaving the Nasdaq indexes poised to enter a bear market
5503 2018-12-21 19:33:35 Yes, timing & order.  US has run $200B deficits 2 of last 4 mths.  In at least 1 of those mths, true interest expense was >100% of tax receipts.  Falling stocks & falling oil will make this much worse, rapidly.
5504 2018-12-21 19:33:33 @RobinhoodApp I bought DVMT stock in my Robinhood account. Dell is planning to buyout DVMT and convert to Class C shares for its IPO. What notifications will be sent by Robinhood for this change? How do I elect to get cash or stocks prior to Dec 28th transaction date?
5505 2018-12-21 19:32:39 No. Moving everything to guarantee fund for a little in 401k.  For fun been buying puts on stocks and watching the world burn.
5506 2018-12-21 19:32:38 he's got a platform cause he talks well and sounds intelligent but when it comes to stocks, he's clueless. how can one say to short SPY for 8 straight years, cover at the top and get super long bank stocks and have any credibility? cause he's selling a product not trading
5507 2018-12-21 19:32:15 So what you are saying is, let's pass another unconstitutional law?  The banning of bumpstocks is ludicrous at best.  As a military veteran and long time gun enthusiast, I find bump-stocks to be a waste of money and ammunition.  Fun, maybe.  Practical, I doubt it.

5516 2018-12-21 19:30:00 At least you are 50% cash in those accounts.  Think of the poor bastards that are still 100% invested in stocks and they need to start using those accounts for college expenses next year.  I know people in this predicament right now.
5517 2018-12-21 19:29:53 Can you please elaborate how women are not equal in the West? Women in their 20’s earn more than men. Women control 51% of all stocks in the US. Women earn more doctorates than men. In many ways they are doing better than men are.
5518 2018-12-21 19:29:04 Sentiment is a useful & important theme. Investors should be wary of stocks that may benefit short term from positive sentiment, but could suffer in the long term if they are overvalued.
5519 2018-12-21 19:28:51 Just buy pot, not pot stocks.

5523 2018-12-21 19:27:08 Worst December for stocks since 1931 and worst Presidential cock since Franklin Pierce in 1854. Coincidence, or is Trump awful in all ways?

5527 2018-12-21 19:25:58 Well i'm sure there will be other stocks to look at > 
5528 2018-12-21 19:25:48 That’s not entirely accurate.  ATF recommended banning, the President decided not to for fear of lawsuits and politics.  Again, he was the big status quo guy.  We, law abiding gun owners, don’t need bump stocks.
5529 2018-12-21 19:25:47 What else is there to do when stocks crash? 
5530 2018-12-21 19:25:35 You're in good company...

5532 2018-12-21 19:24:41 #stocks The essence of a BEAR MARKET is just this:  once it gets rolling, NOTHING can stop it.  A bear does NOT necessarily end with panic selling: such selling may be followed by a sucker's rally, to be followed by grinding further declines to much lower lows, as in 1929-1932.
5533 2018-12-21 19:24:35 Shutting the govt. down @realDonaldTrump, you don’t care about people not getting paid before Christmas. Plus, stocks are down because of it. Aside from belong ISIS.

5540 2018-12-21 19:22:48 Funny, since it appeared in October that the Dems would win the mid-terms and in fact did win the midterms the stocks have started to tank. Apparently the markets liked it better when it was all Republicans.

5544 2018-12-21 19:21:59 Don't get too focused on P/E. It doesn't put some magical floor under the stock.  Stocks can trade extremely undervalued and overvalued.  Look at $AAPL's P/E at $388 a share in June 2013 for example.  Same metrics you're using now.
5545 2018-12-21 19:21:59 No one likes to see markets tank... but what a great opportunity to be dollar-cost-averaging back into some of my favorite tech stocks! Bought more of these today $AMZN $CRM $HUBS $ZEN $APPL. I'm pretty sure they'll all be worth a lot more 2-3 years from now. #ThinkLongTerm

5552 2018-12-21 19:21:01 Shill me some stocks I can write puts on today. Criteria I look for
1) High implied volatility
2) High stock price (don't have to buy 100s of options for a decent size position)
3) Good fundamentals
4) Not reporting earnings in the next week
5) Marketcap > $2B

5557 2018-12-21 19:20:36 I agree with all of the praise. I hated you for a long time because you were always betting against my stocks, but then learned you were always right! Also appreciate you call it both ways (long/short) accurately. Kudos.
5558 2018-12-21 19:20:21 Not yet. We need FANG's and non-divvy stocks to swoon.
5559 2018-12-21 19:20:10 I don't want to get folks over excited this is an opinion only.  Once #lithium stocks go back to normal, I think it should be around 2$-3$ (1 y +-).  Then once they process and mine IMO it would go to newer highs (2-3 y+-).  And I am sure they have a few surprises on the way too

5562 2018-12-21 19:16:43 Wow, you are a moron. Stocks are tanking because of Trump and his childish behavior. Trump is outspending any past president, and now, the racists want to add $5B for a wall that Mexico was supposed to pay for. Tax cuts added more debt as companies still aren't investing
5563 2018-12-21 19:15:54 It’s amazing that there are still stocks out there to sell after the past two months....
5564 2018-12-21 19:15:41 U are delusional. Get back to me when u see the truth. But u won't bc u will be laughed at. Would u laugh in a kids face if they said Hillary molested them? I think u would and should be looked at closely. Who cares about the stocks. U have evil in u. I care about justice.

5582 2018-12-21 19:08:28 You're so incredibly wrong, it's stupid. Stocks are down ONLY due to the fed. Economy is better and stronger than ever. History and facts prove that. Now go delete yourself for being so stupid and biased.
5583 2018-12-21 19:07:50 You're not wrong. I just have a funny feeling that AEW would be willing to partner with other companies. It's one of those things that just helps boost the stocks of talent

5585 2018-12-21 19:05:43 I feel like good stocks in a choppy market magnify the problem cause everybody ends up play hopscotch with little regard for foresight but then again thats just a thought of mine
5586 2018-12-21 19:05:25 Definitely unusual esp. in the last decade.  IMO come Jan.1st institutions & even retail will look for the "best" or "hot" sectors for 2019 & #uranium stocks should rebound & more with both fundamentals (s/d) & catalysts (expiring contracts & new reactors) going for them.
5587 2018-12-21 19:05:17 I think the shorts are back from lunch. They had there PBJ sandwich’s and now back :) lol #StockMarket #stocks #OptionsTrading #cnbc #FoxNews #FoxBusiness

Do you think $ACB is a good buy now?
5590 2018-12-21 19:03:56 one of the funnier lines i've heard: "I buy stocks with a 10 year time horizon, and a 20% stop loss"
5591 2018-12-21 19:03:40 The guy tweets that he's "Tariff Man", and stocks plunge. Meanwhile, bonds are signaling a looming recession, particularly if his out-of-control spending and record debt continue.

5593 2018-12-21 19:03:28 Oil Stocks

I just bought some BP.  

The stock is currently trading for around $37.50, earnings are up 22% YOY, and they pay a dividend of 6.5%.  Although the trend on this stock is down, I feel like it is a good fundamental play.
5594 2018-12-21 19:03:07 So what if the Stocks are falling down WHAT ABOUT HER 33,000 MISSING SCROLLS AND THAT RUS MINING THING AND WHY ISN’T ANYBODY INVESTIGATING HER FOUNDATIONS?
5595 2018-12-21 19:03:06 Yo...stocks are down again...still TANKING!!!!..
MAB
5596 2018-12-21 19:02:49 They are looking forward to the coming depression so that they can snap up all their stocks at a bargain. Thats all they care about.
5597 2018-12-21 19:02:39 The company shouldn’t ever have sold its stocks for $.10 (10 cents ) on the $1.00 with its CEO knowingly he’s given it away almost free , unless the CEO got a really good kick back from the buyers , that’s inside trading crime , he should be locked up for it .
5598 2018-12-21 19:02:36 Stocks are dropping after 2 years of skyrocketing (we’re still in the black), exactly which allies are rethinking & when did they call to tell you this, my tax cuts are working just fine, and the nat’l debt went nuclear thanks to Obama. Your point?
5599 2018-12-21 19:02:32 Trend following works on leading stocks not every stock. It also works on stock indexes. Quality watchlist is crucial. This is just an example of following a trend not the Holy Grail. The profitability comes in the risk/reward ratio over time in bull markets.
5600 2018-12-21 19:02:27 NASDAQ and many stocks are 20% off highs, pretty much definition of bear market. I doubt these kinds of drops will magically repair and bull market continues on aswe are 10 years without a big correction. The bad news flow never shows up before things get extremely nasty
5601 2018-12-21 19:02:27 buy sum apple stocks 2day n forget u have them until the next iphone drops

5602 2018-12-21 19:02:19 Definitely keeping my stocks in snap chat. Idc if the market is projected to crash, Snapchat is continuously being innovative
5603 2018-12-21 19:01:46 A falling stock market creates buying opportunities. Don’t panic, think long term fundamentals in good companies. #stocks #investments #opportunities #personalfinance
5604 2018-12-21 19:01:28 Stocks are cheeks right now
5605 2018-12-21 19:01:14 Barring good clinical news, the share price is still subject to the vicissitudes of the general market conditions. If we go into a recession and a 50% drop in the markets, most biotech stocks also get hammered.
5606 2018-12-21 19:01:13 2 years in power....plunging stocks (worst since 1931), making enemies friends, massive debt from idiotic tax cuts for the rich, administration officials fleeing in droves...what am I missing?
5607 2018-12-21 19:00:50 as someone who is very pro-gun, i am VERY disappointed that bump stocks are now illegal & binary triggers aren’t.. lol that doesn’t fix ANYTHING
5608 2018-12-21 19:00:10 You’re weak in the mind if you didn’t start hedging / going short on stocks when I told you.

Long Crypto! 

Fed Need Not Apply!
5609 2018-12-21 19:00:01 The problem was not the Fed. The problem was stocks were overvalued. The question is, are they still overvalued.
5610 2018-12-21 18:59:42 3/4 of FANG stocks appear to have confirmed a break of their uptrend and seem to be confirming major H&S reversal patterns simultaneously on the same day... The 4th $AAPL has already just been annihilated! Buckle up!!! $AMZN $NFLX $GOOGL
5611 2018-12-21 18:59:35 hey @CNBC have you ever thought that stocks are going down because of crazy man in the @WhiteHouse ... @realDonaldTrump
5612 2018-12-21 18:59:21 Yes to @debtfreestruggl ! The market is getting scared over silly politics and they don't know how to handle the increase of interest rates. The market has dropped so much since september that it's bound to go up. Get some dividend stocks accumulating now!
5613 2018-12-21 18:59:07 Really? Prove it. If you can, you should contact Mueller because he's spent millions & can't come up with anything. My stocks are doing great, just a year end sell off. International standing? they're just pissed they don't get $$ from us anymore. Who cares. Unindicted = innocent
5614 2018-12-21 18:58:49 The Gatwick drone fuckery is making a very good case for the reintroduction of stocks, pillories and public flogging.

5616 2018-12-21 18:58:36 There is so much hot money from growth-obsessed managers who never lived through/invested during the dot-com bubble trapped in tech & “Buzzword Stocks” it’s crazy. That’s why downside risk is huge in the sector

5618 2018-12-21 18:57:54 So that the money is stolen..... We can't take care of donor funds,  debts etc Kenya is gone invest in stocks in the countries you are in unless you want to lose it as soon as it lands here @Nyasirwa
5619 2018-12-21 18:57:54 David's photo......looks so damn crazy.  Love how David claims to love Donald Trump, has his MAGA, but isn't a registered voter and he's pissed that he plans on banning bump stocks.......how ironic.
5620 2018-12-21 18:57:39 I'm glad EA's stocks continue to plummet cause that company is so unepic

5622 2018-12-21 18:56:58 #stocks wow. Just amazed how all these money managers on @CNBC all saw this coming &
Got their client out of stocks
5623 2018-12-21 18:56:57 If you want to attack her for "not caring", let's look at who really doesn't! The GOP has put this country in a very perilous position. Stocks are plunging, allies are rethinking their alliances with us, tax cuts aren't doing what was promised, national debt is out of control...
5624 2018-12-21 18:56:40 EEEH...
IT A BUY.  But what do i know.
Corporate debt imploding right now, that why stocks are hit.
5625 2018-12-21 18:56:27 The amount of notifications I have popping across my phone telling me certain stocks have hit 52wk lows is insane.
5626 2018-12-21 18:56:03 Also Facebook (FB) hitting $127 today is shocking to me as it was over $200 two months ago. And almost all stocks are ending the year on negative gains.
5627 2018-12-21 18:55:15 Sorry. You don't just get to undo the executive branch.    

Buy stocks now or you'll regret it!
5628 2018-12-21 18:55:12 everyone should short US stocks now. democracy failure  imho @SenateGOP
5629 2018-12-21 18:55:00 Today's growing pain at the market could of been worse for my crypto, I heard @realDonaldTrump don't have the gonads to shut the government. But hey, it's all out buying some bearish stocks or Crypto. I have a strong feeling @ethereum is going to make me a sandwich...
5630 2018-12-21 18:54:57 an incredible sale.-for those that want to start to nibble, besides your favorite Cannabis stocks (mine is VFFIF) I like TTD & MDB  ( & a host of others) mentioned NPSNY earlier. not investment advice
5631 2018-12-21 18:54:39 The way your stocks are tanking you won't be able to pay your own electric bills
5632 2018-12-21 18:54:35 If you’re looking to start investing long term I would pick up some stocks within the next week or so or you can wait a couple months till a deeper drop if you think thats what’s gonna happen. I picked up some snapchat shares today as it approaches its 53 week low.
5633 2018-12-21 18:53:53 Many stocks rally on low volume, while the bigger dogs are out of town on Holiday. Look at Thanksgiving week as an example.

5643 2018-12-21 18:50:51 The 7 million dollars for this wall could’ve went to the buy back of bump stocks, help veterans all around the country, and give flint clean drinking water.

5645 2018-12-21 18:50:29 I think you’ve maybe mistaken my comparison to 2000 for a call of a massive crash in stocks.  Bear market/recession, sure.  But, yes, 2000 was extreme valuations. Not comparable.
5646 2018-12-21 18:50:23 La répercussion de la baisse prend plusieurs mois.

5651 2018-12-21 18:49:42 Brent, I think that rule of letting winners run works better for compounders and growth stocks. I do the same that you do for deep value. That also means catching falling knives which I have been doing all week so out of dough right now to catch this one

5658 2018-12-21 18:46:57 So they banned bump stocks 
5659 2018-12-21 18:46:53 I'm no investor, i won't take any long term swing positions until these stocks and the whole market volatility dies down and they form bases of support. I'm not anticipating that for months if not a year. Fundamentals out the window if the trend remains down
5660 2018-12-21 18:46:41 I actually do stocks or aftermarket?

5669 2018-12-21 18:44:46 To your point about long way to

Much lower

5671 2018-12-21 18:42:41  smart move. dude alll the gains from this year have been obliterated and it’s still dropping. I. Am. Nervous. Not just for my stocks lol
5672 2018-12-21 18:41:52 Sauf que si on arrête l'élevage ça veut dire qu'une fois les stocks finis, on n'a aucune réserve (les animaux bougeant et mourant probablement)
5673 2018-12-21 18:41:27 This lefty is glad that Rs have passed criminal reform and banned bump stocks. HOWEVER, this same reform could have been passed under Obama if Rs weren't so focused on political division. There's more to do on guns and Syria is a mess.
5674 2018-12-21 18:40:41 Shake it off Jason, you are still the man!! We've all been there. If there's one thing that I've learned from all of you guys and gals @RagingBull is we never know what's going to happen with stocks. Trade what we see and protect yourself. Merry Christmas JESUS IS THE REASON!!!
5675 2018-12-21 18:40:35 Heh... yeah, if vol actually scaled to sqrt(t), a lot of our observations in finance would suddenly no longer make sense:

Stocks look less volatile with longer holding periods (long-term mean reversion)
Trend-following's profitablility at longer time frames but not shorter ones

5678 2018-12-21 18:39:35 That's not my preferred view. Now an irregular b-wave could get there, because the impulse never did, but another 5th wave doesn't fit IMHO with big-picture cycles and other indices, including european indices, nor how many, many stocks have horrible deteriorated in this decline.
5679 2018-12-21 18:38:30 Hearing about EA's stocks tanking makes me smile, but I do fear for the workers who have little control over the stunts their publisher pulls. I do hope EA makes changes that are for the better and doesn't run a loop of layoffs and budget cuts.
5680 2018-12-21 18:38:25 impressed??? LMAO  when u dont really trade u can claim to buy forever. Just like he's done with the banks stocks from all time highs two months ago
5681 2018-12-21 18:37:35 Travel ban has negatively impacted all tourist industries. And all the rest of the nations that are boycotting the US has pretty much driven stocks into the dirt.

5684 2018-12-21 18:36:53 Result ..... interest rates up, stocks markets down, return of inflation.... what next recession? Making America grate again! 
5685 2018-12-21 18:36:18 Once this is all over, if we survive, it will be a good time to buy stocks for a few weeks lol

5698 2018-12-21 18:32:25 I kind of want @MKupperman to write a comic about the adventures of B(l)airy, where he's a magical talking chair but he's mostly concerned with his stocks and when the neighbors are going to mow their lawn
5699 2018-12-21 18:32:12 For sure I am always trading the stocks on bigger timeframes, happy to throw in some TA :)

5701 2018-12-21 18:32:06 Stocks market is going down to 0 !!!

It won't exist in the future! Useless!

5702 2018-12-21 18:31:56 Nothing seems to make #biotech stocks right for now.
5703 2018-12-21 18:31:33 These stocks have risen so much that it is time for them to cool off.. but these are unique global giants which will weather this too.. 
5704 2018-12-21 18:31:33 I won't lie, watching the broader market carry the #uranium stocks down with it isn't fun to watch but we have to take solace in the fact that this action will have no impact on where these stocks are going to end up in the not too distant future. I'm holding.
5705 2018-12-21 18:31:11 Check this out farmers, he got you on welfare the us stocks are under the basement and he is committing treason every day. And you are at fault for supporting a Racist Idiot. @ABC @CBSNews @CNN @FoxNews @MSNBC @SenateDems @SenateGOP @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP @DNC @GOP
5706 2018-12-21 18:30:59 pour one out for the stocks that have been lost because i keep falling off the platform with 20%
5707 2018-12-21 18:30:44 The homeless again highest numbers in five years and growing./Stocks keep falling back like in the 70's./oil prices in free fall /businesses keep closing or bankrupt /defense Sec. resigned/troops being pulled making Putin happy/ Charities closed of wrong doings/child dies at
5708 2018-12-21 18:30:42 How in the hell will spending money save us money? Oh, Trump logic! Tax cuts aren't working, stocks are crashing, war is threatened, White House officials are jumping ship in droves....yeah, sounds like we are so much better off

5711 2018-12-21 18:29:51 Interestingly i have been running a core PF of about 10-12 stocks for a few years. i am in positive territory this year ( not in your league ) and  rapidly reduced from a few months ago like a lot of others. I am re-assured that many of my core holdings have your share qualities.

Cottage PiesRan all year seller you had none in4weeks then a new improved stock I triedthought its verygud I will buy a few.
5714 2018-12-21 18:29:34 What reasoning don't you buy? Bc this is something that investors didn't just start highlighting as a potential negative for stocks this week. This week just gave then their best evidence.

5716 2018-12-21 18:28:10 Mid-cap stocks join small-caps in bear market territory, leaving just large caps in a correction
5717 2018-12-21 18:27:52 This is patently false. Obama was a supporter of criminal justice reform, and the bill that was passed was a bipartisan bill with strong bipartisan support. Obama also strongly supported much stronger gun restrictions than just banning bump stocks.
5718 2018-12-21 18:27:09 Local pharmacy stocks Revolution foundations and concealer but the stand is always in a state with about 2 shades left it’s so unfair because all I see online lately is people raving about them
5719 2018-12-21 18:26:36 @LooneyTunesWoM
Is there any way to see your current stocks of Dynamite, Anvils, region materials etc?  If not can we have a page with a Supplies listing on it, Prehaps looking like an Acme warehouse?
5720 2018-12-21 18:26:08 LMAO EA lost $21 billion in stocks thanks to Battlefield V, who’s the uneducated ones now?
5721 2018-12-21 18:24:01 Which method gave $1 trillion dollars to companies that used the money to buy back their own stocks rather than raising wages. I'll take that party's plan as the worst one.
5722 2018-12-21 18:23:54 Federal Reserve raised Interest Rates, Stocks falling bear, President under Criminal Investigation, Government 9 short hours from shutting down (400k workers will work with NO PAY), Tariffs and China, Pulling out Syria and now Afghan. 

This is a Crisis!

And it’s Christmas 
5723 2018-12-21 18:23:24 Guys remember How we said to get FREEback from Robinhood, lets them suckers pay us no BS/Clickbait I just got mine $STUDY #stocks #trading
5724 2018-12-21 18:23:06 Yes, sorry Gary, it's been hectic.  Open 10am until 4pm as usual.  Get in early if you want minicasks of Magus as stocks getting low.

5727 2018-12-21 18:22:31 2020 IS THE TIME TO BUY STOCKS WITH CONVICTION.
5728 2018-12-21 18:22:03 In the 1930s Great Depression, people that had zero leverage and kept 15% of their assets in cash saw their purchasing power increase by 700%. That is WITH stocks crashing 90%. Two points. Leverage is dumb. Cash is a great hedge.
5729 2018-12-21 18:21:27 You think it’s a good time to buy? Since the stocks are dropping so much
5730 2018-12-21 18:20:38 And kiddie bump stocks make a great stocking stuffer. That and 6 shooting lessons. Never to early to get armed for the next school year.
5731 2018-12-21 18:20:30 Ok investors stocks are hitting some serious lows..  Google is under 1k  I play the long game...  but now or you for see it going lower?  Same with other FANG stocks..
5732 2018-12-21 18:20:20 A year ago we urged our radio listeners to sell stocks because the market would go sideways as best, most likely down, and getting out then would be better than getting caught in a market correction. As of today the market is down over 6% for the year. More declines to come.

5736 2018-12-21 18:19:50 @creedcnw Bang on. Well done. A GREAT decision for the environment and sustainable fishing. Nations need to come together and ban all super trawlers which do untold damage to fish stocks. This is a great statement by Ireland.
5737 2018-12-21 18:18:44 Forget the bump stocks, GOA HELP THE RED FLAG STATES AND NEW JERSEYS MAGAZINE BAN!!!
5738 2018-12-21 18:18:27 President causes stocks to plunge so he can buy up clearance stocks. What a lowlife!! Sad. #TrumpResign
5739 2018-12-21 18:18:26 Along with the stocks
5740 2018-12-21 18:18:18 sky-rocketing!  If you are against crime, focus on lowering all crime, not just ones committed by the undocumented.  And DT promised he'd get rid of bump-stocks.  It's taking a long time!  We need common-sense gun laws too.  Or are you an advocate for crime, as long as it's 3/
5741 2018-12-21 18:18:16 Friendships are like buying stocks..risk and reward.. why you gonna be putting time and money into something that’s a whole bunch of risk and no reward?? #makesnosense #cuttherisk
5742 2018-12-21 18:18:13 And where is the EPS move for the index?  #stocks #markets
5743 2018-12-21 18:18:08 If everyone pulls out & stocks plummet, maybe they'll finally realize centralized market intervention to create boom/bust cycles of low interest rates to entice people then raising interest rates to shake out weak hands doesn't create wealth only redistributes from poor to rich.
5744 2018-12-21 18:17:40 Stocks keep going down and it hurts watching my money take L's

5746 2018-12-21 18:17:18 For any of you buying individual stocks a useful tool is RSI. After 43 years in the business, I found it a useful tool.

5749 2018-12-21 18:16:51 They have pensions? Most pensions are invested in stocks
5750 2018-12-21 18:16:41 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to improve your chronic fatigue
5751 2018-12-21 18:16:29 $SPY still bear flagging on 5 min crazy if we break lows again, individual stocks breaking down
5752 2018-12-21 18:15:47 Dow close to a 200-point loss after a 400 point gain this morning as a potential gov't shutdown looms, tech stocks decline as well as defens

5754 2018-12-21 18:15:09 It might be worth spending another 500 to go with Tradenet since i can get the BP of 14k while trading. I'm torn bercause I feel like trading equities with a small account is a waste of time as your limited to sub 5 dollar stocks usually. I could trade small and be patient though
5755 2018-12-21 18:15:03 When I was a billing specialist a few years ago At Comcast they were giving their employees great benefits, paying for schooling, 50% off vacations, free Comcast services, free stocks and shares and yearly pay increases & monthly bonuses, Hmmm... now I know why #xfinitylawsuit
5756 2018-12-21 18:14:41 *checking stocks
5757 2018-12-21 18:14:05 No this goes back to the flippant comment on Oct 3 when he said they were a long way from neutral and could go above - then he said the QE reverse was on autopilot - messaging is important, but I would agree stocks were overvalued.  Let the economy alone Fed!
5758 2018-12-21 18:13:41 The Brokerage Plus feature that Trade Ideas has is going to be ground breaking. Every individual trader now has a chance to compete on equal grounds with the institutions. But most new traders think that shorting penny stocks is the golden key
5759 2018-12-21 18:13:39 $NFLX Don’t forget that Netflix year low is $185. And that was before Disney announced Disney+. So lots more room to fall. #stocks #netflix
5760 2018-12-21 18:13:39 apple stocks rise by 35%.
5761 2018-12-21 18:13:16 I love stocks and shares
5762 2018-12-21 18:12:11 The stocks lows and highs should be left out of it. It happens all the time. People were just watching it that weekend because of the situation.
5763 2018-12-21 18:12:11 Which one of these hemp #stocks will be the biggest gainer next week?

5764 2018-12-21 18:12:08 Trip 000 Stocks Getting Incredible Volume!
5765 2018-12-21 18:11:47 Great news: You'll be able to trade stocks for a half day on Monday (Christmas Eve). In case this week hasn't been enough fun.
5766 2018-12-21 18:11:08 It’s the annual swap. Last year, the market dumped crypto to get into the parabolic stock rise, now stocks are liquidating and money is going into crypto, gold, and cash reserves to re-enter stocks at the bottom.
5767 2018-12-21 18:11:01 Where is this wall funding to come from?  No one has said... meanwhile 1/3 of the country is bullying 2/3 into getting the wall funded... doesn’t anyone see what is wrong with this picture...stocks are down ...  and we are letting Isis win ... USA is not great anymore...
5768 2018-12-21 18:10:57 Look at some stocks still waiting for $VIX falling over Grand Canyon ha
5769 2018-12-21 18:10:43 on the app only though, i not sure if you can download it out. but then again people paid for the season's greetings. i mean of course there are people who couldn't get it cause of the stocks. but then for the price you're paying for 1 set you can share with 4-5 ppl it's ok
5770 2018-12-21 18:09:39 Sell stocks in it. I’m in
5771 2018-12-21 18:09:39 Most stocks
5772 2018-12-21 18:09:34 Stocks are up today on comments by Fed Member John Williams, which eased their concerns for Fed Policies not be flexible.  MBS is up 9bps and Yields rose to 2.80%.
5773 2018-12-21 18:09:20 Republicans- what is your end game?  For a long time, I thought I was power and money- but what good are those two things if the very country, and our stock market, implodes? What good will your power be then?  What good will your worthless stocks be? What if our banks collapse?
5774 2018-12-21 18:09:06 So now that bump stocks are banned, I'm SURE no criminal or terrorist would even THINK of trying to use one to commit a crime ......  problem solved!
5775 2018-12-21 18:08:52 If you invested $100 in the Dow Jones stocks on January 26 of this year, it's worth $85 today. You've lost 15% in a time when you can earn about 2-3% in a certificate of deposit. So, if you sell and move to a cd, in about 7 years you'll be back to where you started.
5776 2018-12-21 18:08:15 well done, missed oil stocks
5777 2018-12-21 18:08:00 We've learned from you that money cannot move from bonds into stocks. Money cannot move from anything into stocks (except IPO's which is not what this is about).  Stocks merely change hands.
5778 2018-12-21 18:07:57 Now, imagine you are a government contractor facing a forced unpaid furlough.  If you dip into your 401K savings so you can pay your mortgage, you need to sell stocks at record lows.  A government shutdown hurts not only their present, but also their future.
5779 2018-12-21 18:07:35 It amazes conservatives are ok with Trump banning bump stocks. Isn't this a slippery slope to violating the 2nd amendment? Or do bans only constitute violations when it's not a conservative president initiating them?
5780 2018-12-21 18:07:32 God this online is unplayable. I just fought a DK with 3 stocks 3 minutes
5781 2018-12-21 18:07:15 in otherwords, "we want to unload stocks, and we want dummies to buy so we call sell our positions at a decent price before the market sinks"
5782 2018-12-21 18:07:00 Took a look at ‘I own mad houses and stocks’ Twitter and bruh, this shit not looking good at all...Save up cuz we are about to head into some shit
5783 2018-12-21 18:06:44 Everything Schiff has been talking about is playing out literally right this second.

Would you rather have the most chips in the middle of the poker game, or at the end? It doesn't matter if you go up 50% buying stocks if you're down by the time you liquidate. Use your head.
5784 2018-12-21 18:06:16 LOL NICE TRY BUT OK sit down steven and go cry over ur bump stocks bein taken away
5785 2018-12-21 18:05:51 Great sale on stocks today!
5786 2018-12-21 18:05:19 Stocks under 10 bucks.
5787 2018-12-21 18:05:10 I don't see anything in there about obscenities or threats. Or are you referring to a later interpretation of the amendment as I am when talking about the ban on bump stocks?
5788 2018-12-21 18:04:41 Thanks Joe, time to jump in here...can't ignore the upside potential. Besides, some of my weed stocks teabagging me hard now and not enjoying the sensation, lol.
5789 2018-12-21 18:04:28 Let me guess - the profitable swing trades are on penny stocks?
5790 2018-12-21 18:04:25 A trap will occur after bull run ends! Till then all undervalued stocks will start momentum! 

And all so called analysts will keep protecting their so called long term calls! 
5791 2018-12-21 18:04:16 This time last year cryptos and stocks were both flying. Now it's pure bloodshed.
5792 2018-12-21 18:04:15 Literally every guest on CNBC is "talking their book". It's 99% permabull portfolio managers. Schiff can sell anything he wants, he's a broker. If he believed in stocks, he'd hawk stocks. He chooses to recommend gold.

And not a broken clock. Just playing a very long game.
5793 2018-12-21 18:03:27 A rally in U.S. stocks proved short-lived Friday as investors crowded into defensive plays at the end of a miserable week. Do you consider crypto, specifically #Bitcoin one of the aforementioned “defensive plays”?
5794 2018-12-21 18:03:24 I’m not sure what @WarrenBuffett would say, but people are selling all their stocks and I’ve been losing money.
5795 2018-12-21 18:03:18 And the government is about to shutdown. What’s the reason to keep money in stocks when the price is dropping dramatically day by day with no end in sight?
5796 2018-12-21 18:03:13 It's going downhill fast. Stocks dropping. Good people leaving or going to jail. Allies leaving or killing US citizens. All he talks about is the wall that he promised Mex would pay for. Not sure he is going to go the distance. Doesn't understand working WITH people, not alone.
5797 2018-12-21 18:02:54 There will be 1,460 stocks in test groups but a far bigger group - all those meeting the criteria - will be pilot securities. Those not assigned to test groups will be in the control group. I don't believe anything I said was misleading, sir.
5798 2018-12-21 18:02:54 @ReformedBroker with the best comment on CNBC halftime report for those under 50 yrs of age.  Disregard the volatility and continue to accumulate stocks, don't panic.  Very good advice from Josh.
5799 2018-12-21 18:02:43 I'm sure those particular stocks didn't drop it all due to their mistreatment of customers data, right?
5800 2018-12-21 18:02:39 Starting to see some bids show up across these dead #Biotech stocks under $10..... Some fund is starting to sniff and fill
5801 2018-12-21 18:02:25 So many stocks looking cheap, but still think they get cheaper. Might start nibbling this afternoon.
5802 2018-12-21 18:02:21 That's where the closing stocks of Artemis went...

5804 2018-12-21 18:02:13 In America they think recent GDP growth came from firms building up inventory to mitigate the risks from trade wars. The downside is lower growth next year as stocks get run down

Presumably BrExit will have the same effect. Growth in production now. lower production next year
5805 2018-12-21 18:01:37 Fed's undeclared mandate is to levitate the stocks because since Greenspan, STOCKS = ECONOMY. Why do you think stock market cap > 130% of GDP
5806 2018-12-21 18:01:26 Just put the perpetrators in stocks in the departure lounge of Gatwick. They won’t do it again
5807 2018-12-21 18:01:14 Doesn’t matter if stocks are down. Go to a store right now and you’ll see the economy is just fine.
5808 2018-12-21 18:01:00 I will be on CNBC's "PowerLunch" at 2pm EST today (12/21) to talk about whether or when this bear market in stocks will come to an end! please tune in!

5810 2018-12-21 18:00:42 What's the fascination with banning tubular plastic things with holes like straws and bump stocks?

What's next?  Garden hoses and pool noodles?
5811 2018-12-21 18:00:37 I am currently hating the fact that I got kicked out of Elite Smash on Samus because I just lost 10 matches in a row, to 10 different people, all playing either 2 stocks, 3 minutes, FD or Hazards ON stages.

5815 2018-12-21 17:59:48 Did it short stocks ?
5816 2018-12-21 17:59:37 So hard to stay in cash...so many stocks looking primed.  How low can you go?

Probably lower, so I wait.
5817 2018-12-21 17:59:00 It doesn't matter what YOU want or need. It's about the 2nd amendment! And the freedom! Stop giving into the gun control agenda. Give them bump stocks and they will take semi auto next!
5818 2018-12-21 17:58:45 Bear market also blows the froth off the Bull market. Companies that did well on hype over substance are seen for what they are and funds shift sideways into more solid value/ quality stocks. I was slow on inrcreasing my cash %, but have been over last while.
5819 2018-12-21 17:58:36 Yes stocks are down. But jobs are at a surplus for sure

5822 2018-12-21 17:57:43 Before crash #Trump spent much time pumping his #BigFatUglyBubble bragging about #stocks like #WallStreet whore. Wonder what he’s up to now?
5823 2018-12-21 17:57:43 Is there a particular reason that US IT stocks tank so hard today? It seems more excessive than the painful bleeding these last two months has been (when does _that_ end, btw?)
5824 2018-12-21 17:57:39 You forgot about a president personally pushing down stocks with his non sequitur tweets and a secretary of the treasury who says stock valuations are good now.
5825 2018-12-21 17:57:33 As we short stocks which moves 5-10%, one may suffer immense loss if there is no SL. Also one misses huge profit (which is more common) as We are accustomed on cutting our profits first. Happy Trading!

5830 2018-12-21 17:56:46 Why did like 5 stocks that I follow all hit a year low all on the same day? Prelude to market crash maybe? #Trumpeconomics
5831 2018-12-21 17:56:23 @BloombergQuint Reinforces my belief spreadsheet analysis & forecasts can never be trusted. Buy stocks that have a good business model, strong management & corporate governance culture. You can't go wrong!!
5832 2018-12-21 17:56:16 Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house, not a Bull was stirring not even a calf.

The stocks were hung by the cemetery with care. In hopes that St. Powell soon would be there....
5833 2018-12-21 17:56:14 Ruthless market.. even low multiple stocks with good results and raised guidance are being treated like this way $M
5834 2018-12-21 17:56:11 Stocks itermediate cycle low soon?

5838 2018-12-21 17:54:51 best trading market in some time. fade in and out. i’m building for long term, having gotten to 50% long equities in yesterday’s plunge, but always will fade and trade around 2-5% move in stocks and index etf’s faded morning 10%, back in 10% on big 30min drop. over and over
5839 2018-12-21 17:54:34 But I'm already all in on U stocks, I'm even considering selling my car to raise more capital for investing!  My work is within cycling distance, although I don't really fancy the idea of cycling to work in the snow...
5840 2018-12-21 17:53:34 Trump realizes he's toast. How do I know? Because he's going ahead with the government shut down. Trump has always cited the stock market, but it's been plunging, in part due to the looming shutdown. But Trump doesn't give a sh*t anymore about stocks - because he knows he's toast
5841 2018-12-21 17:53:19 Deficit soaring. Stocks crashing. No wall paid for by Mexico. Government shutdown. America, let’s not pick a crooked game show host next time. Please. #TrumpResign

5848 2018-12-21 17:50:40 Raising my hand! I loath this creature. With Ginsburg recovering, scumbag Trump, and soulless Republicans it’s just an anxiety nightmare. Did I mention my 401k and personal stocks have taken a hit. #25thThe45th
5849 2018-12-21 17:50:33 @jimcramer Jim, how do you think trading ETFs 24/5 is working out and should it be extended to individual stocks?  Doesn’t sound like a good idea to me.
5850 2018-12-21 17:50:28 Debauchery in stocks lol @jeffkilburg @HalftimeReport
5851 2018-12-21 17:50:20 He’s great, I don’t necessarily buy the stocks he alerts, just similar stocks in the same index as a indicator. He’s right probably 80% of the time which is high, account size should be decent sized tho.

5854 2018-12-21 17:49:41 Media does that on purpose. They're trying to drop stocks like a rock by creating uncertainty. Very evil people.
5855 2018-12-21 17:49:06 @mitchellreports , the fox group, wants this, because it’s about 2020, and the stocks.  If trump goes down, fox loses, a vast , part of their audience. They are about ratings.  They went all in on trump. They will lose, viewers, if they go to the center.  Before trump.

5860 2018-12-21 17:48:38 I don't put as much weight on vacation week statistics as I used to. These days people can be sitting in a lawn chair in the Hamptons trading stocks on their cell phones.
5861 2018-12-21 17:48:00 Thanks JR - to be honest I find Stocks etc a useful distraction but I'm taking advantage of the soggy Markets to be a bit more relaxed. I don't see any great need to do anything much with my Portfolio so just letting things play out. p
5862 2018-12-21 17:47:45 stocks are not selling off on a Govt shutdown.
5863 2018-12-21 17:47:00 Stocks perform well over every 10 year period measured since 1929. They’re due for a correction, but let’s not cry about the sky falling.
5864 2018-12-21 17:46:58 No capitulation yet in stocks!  Tell me if you see any non traders on Facebook talking about the market?  We have more pain coming!
5865 2018-12-21 17:46:51 They are considered safe stocks like utilities

5872 2018-12-21 17:44:52 My mother called today and mentioned she sold most of her stocks weeks ago and just held a "trading account now" - not sure what to make of this call but clearly she is a better trader than I am now
5873 2018-12-21 17:43:53 Stocks are a native app on iPhones for a reason.
5874 2018-12-21 17:43:52 Don't forget... Tax Breaks for the rich to buyback their stocks. Market had a BS pump by Trump to make him look good. They knew without those tax breaks, the market would greatly fall
5875 2018-12-21 17:43:50 Bump stocks are a horrible invention. Off topic maybe, just sayin.
5876 2018-12-21 17:43:42 Could also be quants/factor model strategies, as dispersions by factors seem extreme today. Been a lot of relentless downtrends in boring stocks - food stocks being most prominent I’ve noticed
5877 2018-12-21 17:43:25 Me: Bored, living with parents, decide to invest in some stocks for fun and learning.

Stock market: Gets fucked hard. 

Me: Loses 40 dollars.

5882 2018-12-21 17:42:27 I agree that the fed did affect the markets but are you saying that stocks rising had nothing to do with the cycle and their profits increasing?
5883 2018-12-21 17:42:10 I have $SPOT on a watchlist with FAANG and a bunch of other tech stocks. Can confirm it does go down literally every day.

5885 2018-12-21 17:41:33 Good thing regardless but most stocks are failing to be fair
5886 2018-12-21 17:41:29 Over the last 26 weeks(start of July) 25 of the S&P 500 stocks are down over 40%, nearly 60 are off 30% or more, only 120 are higher, fwiw, $spx, $spy, #spy, #twows
5887 2018-12-21 17:41:29 Typo-stocks
5888 2018-12-21 17:41:11 I think between this and the looming government shutdown, impeaching trump would be positive for stocks
5889 2018-12-21 17:41:07 Small cap stocks either have horribly wrong consensus earnings projections or are trading at absurdly cheap forward P/Es. 

I see a BoA ML Russell 2000 forward P/E (ex negative earners) of 13.5x, only lower the last 25 years at a quarter-end in Q3 2011 and Q4 2008.

5892 2018-12-21 17:41:01 @GuyAdami I don’t understand the constant swings and slam on stocks.  What does the market want?????
5893 2018-12-21 17:41:00 If stocks keep falling as many think they might due to "strong USD & higher rates" w/global CBs selling USTs, the US will be forced to slash US entitlements, slash US DoD spending, default on UST bonds, or signif devalue the USD.  Those are the only choices if CBs don't buy USTs
5894 2018-12-21 17:40:45 Hillary are you pissed because you didn't pull your stocks out of company's with gvmt contracts funding these battles? Or are your assets froze due 2 your crimes against our country & many others.  Maybe you should go back to the woods until your hearings

5896 2018-12-21 17:40:07 I attempted to trade $N.V this morning for the oversold bounce but the setup was not right. MJ stocks are weak today and I decided to just watch the stock instead of trading it.
5897 2018-12-21 17:40:06 Your interest rates chart people were hating on was spot on and suggesting this was going to happen to stocks ;)
5898 2018-12-21 17:39:58 Pretty sure if Powell knew what would happen in the mkts after the meeting, he wld have at least changed his tone-(arguably he should have known better) - that's why Williams was trotted out today- so if Powell sounds different next time he talks, does everyone buy stocks up 5%??
5899 2018-12-21 17:39:57 Hahaha.  I neant month-by-month returns on stocks.

5910 2018-12-21 17:36:43 Stocks crashing because of @realDonaldTrump and his tariffs and @federalreserve hiking rates.

5912 2018-12-21 17:36:17 You’re weak if you aren’t holding stocks over the weekend and Xmas (which is cancelled)

5914 2018-12-21 17:35:49 By who Hillary and snoops? Comey? Stocks did change hands and what does a stock represent? The Clintons are the ones running around in Russia collecting millions in speaking fees from Russian oligarchs. Last time I checked trump tower in Moscow was never built.

5917 2018-12-21 17:35:34 Yeah I was reading how #IMB are making good progress on Vaping 'Next Generation' products but still they are very small part. A buy on these Stocks is a bet on them developing NG stuff fast enough to replace Burnt Tobacco. I'm defo wary of them but IMB probably best.
5918 2018-12-21 17:35:06 People are on the sidelines and no one wants to touch stocks
5919 2018-12-21 17:34:43 MJ stocks are weak again and broke previous support $WEED $CGC $APHA $ACB $CRON. I sold $CRON at 15.40 CAD yesterday at a loss. I would like to say thanks to the Justin @42oCapital for the advice to sell. I do not have any MJ stocks and I have been trading #oil & #natgas lately
5920 2018-12-21 17:34:20 Thursday was High yield bonds worst day since Brexit,with price crashing to lowest since April 2016.The collapse of junk bonds was an early sign that stocks were going to totally crash in 2008,and now we see a very similar pattern playing out in 2018 as we head into the new year.
5921 2018-12-21 17:34:09 I picked good #stocks, I will hold going long because I can do that. Won't sell at a loss.

5927 2018-12-21 17:33:40 They are not hibernating, they are maturing your money by buying stocks, earning interest in the bank, buying bonds, etc., while they figure out what to do. If they reimburse you (if they eventually do it), will earn money just by the fact of keeping it all this time...
5928 2018-12-21 17:33:37 S&P 500 closed at 2790.37 on Dec. 3. The next day #Trump tweeted "I am a Tariff Man." Stocks haven't stopped selling off since. As of now, the S&P is down 13% since that tweet. He blames the Fed and the Democrats for the selloff. Sorry, Mr. President, this one's on you.
5929 2018-12-21 17:33:25 '"And there are other stocks besides $NBEV."

Who knew?
5930 2018-12-21 17:33:12 @realDonaldTrump This is an absolute shit show. Look at stocks again today. Down down down.

5932 2018-12-21 17:32:51 It's an interesting point - I hold a wide mix of Stocks so the Big Picture moves my Portfolio a lot. If just trading a few AIM Stocks on their own merits it probably has less effect but at moment liquidity must be a huge problem.

5934 2018-12-21 17:32:38 Good news for mortgages from our friends at OnQ Financial: Stocks have been routed and fears over a slowing economy have taken over. As investors seek safety in bonds, this has helped mortgage rates improve.
5935 2018-12-21 17:32:22 Omg u make no sense. It is a bubble $AMZN likely goes south of 1000 before all this is done and it would still be 5x where it was 6yrs ago. The anomaly was that FAANG stocks literally doubled every year for 5 years. I don’t have time to help u. Go back to sleep

5938 2018-12-21 17:31:40 Utility and pharmaceutical stocks are the only groups showing plus signs for 2018. And even they, the defensive groups, are barely higher. That is not something we have seen in prior downdrafts.
5939 2018-12-21 17:31:23 Most stocks hitting fresh 52 week lows
5940 2018-12-21 17:31:17 MT @UdallTechStrat So when MEDIA says there are "no upside catalysts," or no reason for stocks to go higher, the one thing I don't do is SELL a damn thing!!  $SPX

5946 2018-12-21 17:30:31 NRA done burnt the bridge. Supported Trump in an illegal move to ban bump stocks and make thousands of legal gun owners felons. Not renewing my membership, supporting GOA instead.
5947 2018-12-21 17:30:07 I believe $BB is a bargain too so I’ve added. It’s impressive how the price is pushed down so hard, bit it can go up fast too. Chen should buy stocks, besides increasing revenues. If not, stock price will break LT low :(
5948 2018-12-21 17:29:43 #TrumpResign A trillion dollar tax cut for the rich to invest in their own stocks. Artificial inflation. Stocks soar. Tariffs kick in. Stocks fall. Market crashes. The most detested man of all time sits in front of the television, cooking up a new lie

5960 2018-12-21 17:26:16 If we allow the Executive Branch to ban bump stocks without any accountability from Congress, then they could ban any and all gun parts in the future. Think triggers, barrels, magazines, receivers, you name it...
5961 2018-12-21 17:25:59 Even Lebenthal admitting to puking some stocks-that's saying something as usually he has the clearest head on the panel-pretty much everyone has now been beaten into submission-best thing I've seen in probably 12 mos- obviously, you had to have had a plan to prepare to be buying
5962 2018-12-21 17:25:59 $NBEV - If you play with Stops and lose, you deserve it. If you put all your eggs in 1 basket and lose, you deserve it. If you can't handle the volatility, don't play. This isn't rocket science folks. I'm loving this market !! And there are other stocks besides NBEV.
5963 2018-12-21 17:25:17 So when MEDIA says there are "No upside catalysts" or a Reason for stocks to go higher, one thing I don't do is SELL a damn thing!!  $SPX
5964 2018-12-21 17:25:16 Do not read any of these positive articles on stocks right now. Focus on the negative. Unless you’re trading short term, like buying and selling within a day or less. Short shit if you need too
5965 2018-12-21 17:25:04 Schiff says 5-10% gold and foreign dividend stocks. Though if you're an American and things are going to get that bad, idk why he's so weak on the % of gold, he lines up with all the other main stream people.
5966 2018-12-21 17:25:02 Pumps and Dumps happen in traditional stocks too, today:
- Fed comes on TV to give a grey statement with some hopium
- Poor souls buy thinking we gonna bounce

5971 2018-12-21 17:24:16 Nice work on digging up fund info. Makes perfect sense. I'm completely convinced this hike was the straw that reprices stocks. Funny tho, market first targeting yielding shares that represent real performing assets that carry us thru downturns. Worn will turn.

5973 2018-12-21 17:23:50 Yeah, you promised us National Concealed Carry Reciprocity too... instead you banned bump stocks. You are never going to get support from the left. All you're doing is driving away your base. @senatemajldr @PressSec @VP @SpeakerRyan
5974 2018-12-21 17:23:32 ETFs are great when things only go one way, then why pay for any advice.

5994 2018-12-21 17:19:34 Yeah it really plays into the Stoploss dilemma - in markets like this there must be people getting taken out of great Stocks all the time which in time could be huge disadvantage. However I'm still leaning towards 'Sell on first bad news'.
5995 2018-12-21 17:19:24 Did a couple of call BWBs on $TWTR & $QQQ to gain some slight short deltas. 
Idea being if it keeps dropping, I can turn it into a free butterfly, and if we get a bounce, perhaps I get to take them off for some decent gains.
BWBs are slow movers.

6083 2018-12-21 17:01:33 Stocks are sliding down hill so fast that it's on track to be the worst since 1931! Thanks Trump for being the worst president In history!!! Screw Trump, it's all your fault!!! Companies are leaving this country in record numbers!
6084 2018-12-21 17:01:16 Next week, the Bond markets close early on Monday, Christmas Eve, Stocks close at 1:00 p.m. ET. All U.S. markets are closed on Tuesday, Chri
6085 2018-12-21 17:01:07 Stocks mixed in quiet trading.
6086 2018-12-21 17:01:06 I have guns I have concealed carry and I have a bump stocks everything was purchased legally. So all I have to say is don’t come and try to take what are legally purchased.
6087 2018-12-21 17:01:05 This isn’t completely true. There’s genuine growth which is reflected crudely by equity value (homes,stocks,etc) and the flow of which you exchange money (everyone spends $10,000 on even more crap and ends up with $0 in the bank instead of 1,000 and 0)
6088 2018-12-21 17:01:01 Wall Street Instant Update; 12noon #Stocks weaken following early rally attempt, the Dow down 5 points, the Nasdaq Comp. leading to the downside by 1.2%,
6089 2018-12-21 17:00:58 any weed stocks are gonna skyrocket once that shit is legal everywhere. so yeah, good investment
6090 2018-12-21 17:00:47 Stocks beefing up ... Dow +342 points. 10-yr 2.80%. Mortgage Bonds off session highs.
6091 2018-12-21 17:00:47 Developed markets stocks continue to get hammered on the Fed's "policy mistake". US stocks at levels of Sep-Oct 2017. 

(brushing off the reduction of the balance sheet as not "creating any problems" was a big mistake)

EM stocks surprisingly holding up on a weaker dollar.
6092 2018-12-21 17:00:39 Yall excited to buy some cheap stocks of the next year or 2?
6093 2018-12-21 17:00:37 Don’t fight the bear in FAANG stocks. They have much more downside from here, especially Facebook.

$FB $AAPL $AMZN $NFLX $GOOG $GOOGL
6094 2018-12-21 17:00:29 And the NRA will be there to help, just like they helped Trump ban bump stocks and set a precedent for future presidents to make whatever they want illegal at a whim.

6099 2018-12-21 16:59:50 J'ai une 3eme hypothèse : Sony ne sait pas gérer ses stocks et a foiré son dernier inventaire. Mon expérience pro m'a montré que l'incompétence est souvent l'explication la plus probable 
6100 2018-12-21 16:59:47 Have said this many times in the past- nothing like sitting in a ton of cash, and then as people puke sells stocks, you get hit buying them back 30+% lower than where you sold to the herd- it's annoying but all part of the process...
6101 2018-12-21 16:59:45 Stocks are sliding down hill so fast that it's on track to be the worst since 1931! Thanks Trump for being the worst president In history!!! Screw Trump, it's all your fault!!!
6102 2018-12-21 16:59:37 If you are picking off a few good ones Ok but if not just sit tight- stocks were overvalued - Aesop/ slow but steady wins the race - just believe in that!!
6103 2018-12-21 16:59:29 Stocks are sliding down hill so fast that it's on track to be the worst since 1931! Thanks Trump for being the worst president In history!!! Screw Trump, it's all your fault!!!

6105 2018-12-21 16:58:45 US Stocks: Idol worshiping has ne'er been my cup of tea.  When Warren Fucking Buffett gloated over his ownership of Apple stocks, and everyone else followed suit...   How's that working out?
6106 2018-12-21 16:58:21 @realDonaldTrump So, stocks are on track for the worst December since the Great Depression. Will you take on the mantle of this along with your pending government shutdown and the half million+ people who will not be paid because of it?
6107 2018-12-21 16:58:20 Disagree - Market Cap for crypto does not represent the actual money is system.

For Stocks - the per security price is derived based on initial capital / shareholders - so in this case MV represents the actual money
6108 2018-12-21 16:58:16 we dont have many secular quality stocks man!!
6109 2018-12-21 16:57:51 I’ll be spending a lot of money on stocks over the next month
6110 2018-12-21 16:57:43 My stocks are down 27% in the last 3 months while I’m trying to pay for an MBA.
6111 2018-12-21 16:56:40 Based on the action in biotech stocks, I can sleep easy tonight knowing all the diseases & illnesses of the world have been cured and there is no need for research or treatments any longer.
Rest well, my friends.
6112 2018-12-21 16:56:37 Just out of interest, given that we have had over two years’ notice now, was it not within reason to have expected a responsible health service to have established alternate supply chains, or perhaps increased stocks?
6113 2018-12-21 16:56:35 look! stocks were overvalued ( techs!!)-these guys LUV Trump- they make money!!  Economy is OK - it has been for years!  but that is not good enough- these greedy Trumpsters WANT more/ China is a major concern / rate hikes- let's blame it on the Fed excuse= stay put the LONG view
6114 2018-12-21 16:56:30 Why don’t garages have a fuel discount season? Prices slashed by up to 50% on all regular diesel and petrol while stocks last!
6115 2018-12-21 16:56:25 @chelseahandler I live in Nevada and can proudly say that we elected a new Democrat Attorney General Aaron Ford. I know he is talking about background checks and bump stocks which our former AG Laxalt would not touch. trump is just trying to beat New AG Ford to the punch.
6116 2018-12-21 16:56:16 Stocks are sliding down hill so fast that it's on track to be the worst since 1931! Thanks Trump for being the worst president In history!!! Screw Trump and republicans, it's all your fault!!!
6117 2018-12-21 16:56:09 You idiots already compromised on bump stocks. Lost a lot of respect
6118 2018-12-21 16:55:11 IMO, they are good for shorting non available or hard to borrow stocks in a direct market. Anything else, don't really touch. Since you can short easily with mid/large cap stocks in a direct market account and don't suffer the spread, in exceptions of IPOs.
6119 2018-12-21 16:55:02 Would it be different? Maybe, maybe not. Is there something that would make #WallStreet more nervous than usual? Well, #Trump's already got Wall Street skiddish, so....And, every time in the past that the #USA Government #Shutdown stocks fell. So,why wouldn't they fall this time?
6120 2018-12-21 16:54:53 Shorts for 2019 - social media stocks and anything to do with London property prices?
6121 2018-12-21 16:54:08 I saw on stocks that I was on the rise. Didn’t convince me enough to buy any though. It’s still a no from me 
6122 2018-12-21 16:54:04 Think of the poor saps averaging down on FAANG stocks or buying the former leaders bec they missed the run up. Well they had a choice to sign up to your svc 
6123 2018-12-21 16:53:47 Stocks are sliding down hill so fast that it's on track to be the worst since 1931! Thanks Trump for being the worst president In history!!! Screw Trump and republicans, it's all your fault!!!
6124 2018-12-21 16:53:20 A lot of stocks will be dropping!
6125 2018-12-21 16:53:05 Dear @RobinhoodApp and @Stash, I get it - all my stocks and investment funds are at a 52 week low. 

Enough with the reminders.
6126 2018-12-21 16:52:47 @jimcramer Why not tell it like it is... Many stocks extremely over-valued in 1st half with a slow growth [yet still growth] in 2019. AND no reason for them to return to over-valued levels. Look for NEW leaders in 2019.
6127 2018-12-21 16:52:23 Mr. President,  stop belittling the 2nd Amendment !!!  No ban on bump stocks!
6128 2018-12-21 16:52:13 So the New York FED President said this morning in so many words that they WILL basically “feel the market” when it comes to policy making in the near future (Trump’s term.)That’s why stocks are up, and you can chalk up another one for @realDonaldTrump

6132 2018-12-21 16:51:20 Wrong! No uraniumchanged hands EVER! Only company stocks....do you guys ever actually read and fact check shit or do you just listen to nonsensical conspiracy theories? Seriously
6133 2018-12-21 16:50:52 LOL at the stock market tanking, knowing 85% of stocks are owned by the richest 10%, and rich fuckers thought Trump in the WH was going to be a goldmine. Thoughts and prayers, assholes!

(And yes, I know they'll make this hurt us poors more than it hurts them, but still.)
6134 2018-12-21 16:50:47 Citron's garbage reports to swing Twitter stocks up & down through the entire year is pure insider trading game for his own personal profits. SEC shall remove his license & prosecute him 4 insider trading.

Bump stocks are going out now and if we are persistent and keep the pressure up, maybe AR-15s will be next; but constant pressure on legislatures is going to be necessary.
Blessed be.

Any withdrawal for education or wedding of kids if attracts tax in spite of paid STT gives feeling of cheating by the Govt
6144 2018-12-21 16:46:58 ...ZERO chance of getting their money back. Houses are exactly like stocks, you buy at the top, youre screwed. You have top buy a house below fair market value to gain any equity in it. Again, you can get your asking price now because of market conditions, not anything else.
6145 2018-12-21 16:46:48 Two things he’s done right: signed the First Step Act, and banned bump stocks. But in two years those accomplishments seem overwhelmingly weak in light of everything else he mucked up.
6146 2018-12-21 16:46:44 In 70's there was the "Nifty Fifty"  they lead the market all investors gravitated toward them and then Nifty Fifty crashed and caused the bear market  --  a cautionary tale of unrealistic expectation of market leading stocks

6152 2018-12-21 16:45:51 @StockTwits NEW stocks with NEW growth  will be the key to success in 2019 & 2020. ENPH & CERS are good examples of huge growth going forward. ENPH soon. CERS perhaps a bit later in 2019 before the extreme growth kicks in.

6163 2018-12-21 16:43:39 @StockTwits Many high momentum stocks were over-valued and is the real cause of the decline with slower growth expectation in 2019. AND.. any bounce SHOULD be short lived. Why should it return to over-valuation?
6164 2018-12-21 16:43:34 I hope all Trump voters now realize their ignorance... stocks failing at home and now they know they were taken by Russian internet operators. Blood in middle east is on their hands!

6185 2018-12-21 16:34:15 Breadth indicators can complement price-based systems. Unlike price oscillator, breadth reaches extreme zone (overbought-oversold) when many number of stocks are still in bullish or bearish trend. It helps us overcome potential complacency from price based systems.

6196 2018-12-21 16:30:37 Don’t look at such short timeframes... stocks are already in a bear market in many countries. 2019 will be one of the craziest years ever. Expect a small pullback as possible. Afterwards really big plunge down.
6197 2018-12-21 16:30:13 Instead of decreasing and aiming to eliminate the stocks that are most detrimental to the future of the race and the world, it tends to render them to a menacing degree dominant. Margaret Sanger

6207 2018-12-21 16:27:53 The speculation that Cashin is throwing, regarding a rate cut next year is just an effort from his side to create a false sense about something that might sound good for stocks ie his main business

6214 2018-12-21 16:24:25 Somewhat nerfed, particularly in Doubles. You only gain aura from a 1 stock deficit no more from 2 stocks. His power was tweaked up a bit to compensate but still a bit weak at 0. Also his weight went from 99 down to 91 so he'll be getting less aura anyway

6220 2018-12-21 16:22:27 There are always deals in every market. I had this in mind because many people I chat with all are "100% total market investors" and don't pick individual stocks. Thanks for the comment

6222 2018-12-21 16:21:37 David Hogg is a moron.  Trump banned bump stocks with an executive order which means he could just as easily reverse it or any new sitting President.  David Hogg didn’t do jack squat

6225 2018-12-21 16:20:28 I think stocks were set up to soar for as long as the man was on-camera. Get  back over 23,000 and 2480.

Williams could've said "neutral"=88.75%, and it wouldn't have made any difference.

6230 2018-12-21 16:19:50 AHahah.. It is quite the opposite.
Stock market is way more affordable for the common American today than EVER before. Even the poorest of poor can afford some stocks, AND STILL GET THE DIVIDEND.

This is INSANEly cheap.

No time ever before has the little guy won as much as now.

6242 2018-12-21 16:14:28 Looks like @realDonaldTrump is conducting an all-out @Twitter disinformation campaign this morning, hoping to rouse his supporters into using their currently legal bump stocks to support his stupid fucking slush fund wall.

6244 2018-12-21 16:14:01 Don't blame Trump for the stock market. Did you blame Obama for the 2008 crash? This was the longest bull run we've had and a correction was bound to happen. We did not fix "08 crash, Fed reserve simply printed more money and bought stocks to keep it going.

I just rewarded myself by working on stocks and cleaning my room plus mopping.
6251 2018-12-21 16:12:08 The only "advantage" it has for me is is that it stocks ingredients the other shops around here wouldn't (Bok choy for example) but I feel dirty every time I go in.

6256 2018-12-21 16:11:27 They're not changing the law, you see. Bump stocks were always illegal; they just realized it now.

6262 2018-12-21 16:10:35 Stocks soar?

6264 2018-12-21 16:09:50 How to lose 15-20% of capital in 6 months: invest in stocks
6265 2018-12-21 16:09:42 Bitcoin was positively correlated to gold and was inversely correlated to stocks in December; i.e. BTC is marching decisively towards established safe haven and SoV status 
6266 2018-12-21 16:09:11 Stocks are owned by the top 1% and top 10%. Most have low balances in their 401k. Yes, I think you'll see an impact in the sectors that cater to the rich.
6267 2018-12-21 16:08:07 And what about that President Taft. We should dig up his body and beat it (As criminals run the WH, stocks crash, Puti gains ground, and Don & family sack our taxes), you are correct comrade.
6268 2018-12-21 16:08:04 I didn’t mean literally XBI. I meant individual bio stocks.
6269 2018-12-21 16:07:57 Hopefully you mean stock mutual fund.  Owning a few stocks is high risk. Glad you have time on your side
6270 2018-12-21 16:07:36 in the 6 years since sandy hook, all we’ve done is made bump stocks illegal
6271 2018-12-21 16:07:33 Interesting that a 20% correction on the SP500 brings it right to the 200 DMA at about 2350. #TA #stocks #fed
6272 2018-12-21 16:07:29 The power of central banks is they can create paper wealth without underlying real wealth. The belief that stock prices must correct to meet the real lack of underlying strength doesn't take into account currency devaluation.  In 2030 you could have high stocks and useless money.

6281 2018-12-21 16:05:01 Market is very rational
 It is all retail investors and many tutes rotating out of equity and specially growth stocks. So a lot of sales,  whichever the price is and no buyers to bring support.

6283 2018-12-21 16:04:48 I was booted from a FB group because I expressed my disappointment that the leader of the country, can direct at a whim, a federal agency that has already approved the bump stocks.  I hope the change fails the courts.

6285 2018-12-21 16:04:30 I dont think they are scared. Just seems like they are digging in for a fight. Because all these so called bills would end up in litagation on top of the ones that all ready are. If you look at the state level most Bill's passed are in litagation now. Like the bump stocks.
6286 2018-12-21 16:04:29 Don't listen to Bridgewater listen to GS THEY are smart. 10/12/18 GS says the sell-off is just aboutover& tells investors toget back into growth stocks GS strategist David Kostin said there is "limited further downside" for stocks after recent sell-off sent the Dow down almost 6%

6292 2018-12-21 16:03:51 Obviously he has been living in his 'bubble'. As if he doesn't know that economy crisis has been happening all around the world, with the same outcome: stocks plunging. A very common tactic to shift the focus from his 'alleged' embezzlement scandals.

6302 2018-12-21 15:59:30 See, if Trump was smart, he’d sign the gov’t extension to February. Why? Cause then he can fight Pelosi instead of Ryan and McConnel. It would be a distraction from stocks and investigations. It would be after the State of the Union high. But he is just not that smart!!!
6303 2018-12-21 15:59:03 If you have bitcoin or shitcoin losses in 2018, it’s time to sell them all and immediately buy back bitcoin (if you wish). Unlike stocks, US tax laws allows you to immediately re-invest while claiming the capital losses (which can help offset gains). Credit to: @Saunderswsj

6335 2018-12-21 15:50:56 This is actually excellent advice for those bought bitcoin in 2017. Sell, claim the capital losses and immediately re-invest. Works for shit coins too. Tax law allows this immediate re-buying (unlike stocks). However if you have bitcoin gains, it’s better not to sell.

6341 2018-12-21 15:49:33 Two rate hikes, huh. That's good for stocks but the last one wasn't.
6342 2018-12-21 15:49:28 Rate rise = other alternatives for money in bonds, notes and CDs. Money leaving stocks for those = prices drop. Eventually a new, lower price/earnings multiple brings us an equilibrium where enough value-oriented investors buy stocks that the price stops dropping.

6347 2018-12-21 15:48:16 While I support @GunOwners and @gunpolicy in their efforts to overturn the bump stock ban by suing the feds, at the core of this problem is the NFA, the GCA and the 86 machine gun ban. Bump stocks only exist as a market solution to the machine gun ban.

6350 2018-12-21 15:47:50 The Fed raising rates has more to do with the market drop than the trade policy being corrected.
Also the tech stocks are taking huge hits because they are being exposed for their rampant corruption and are on the verge of losing unwarranted protections leading to regulations

6352 2018-12-21 15:46:58 So! U.S. Congress  just proposed a Bill, where your not going to get taxed for trading CryptoCurrencies... Thats right!  they are trying to push a Bill right now that makes CryptoCurrencies like Money..not like comodities or Stocks..     like Money itself!
6353 2018-12-21 15:46:56 Trump officially banned bump stocks 2 days ago. If that were Obama my TL would be filled w/ outrage on 1 side & celebration on the other.

6358 2018-12-21 15:45:16 You are basing your point on the situation with fisheries in the 70's we have moved on from there. I am sure the SG will put in the necessary controls to ensure that stocks are kept healthy.
6359 2018-12-21 15:45:05 There certainly is an alt universe where a Dem president pulls us out of multiple wars, forces out a hawk Sec of Def, gets protectionist on trade, passes criminal justice reform, and bans bump stocks unilaterally- and that Pres receives universal praise from the media.

6469 2018-12-21 15:14:12 We're getting screwed as it is. A recession is creeping up, the stocks are down. He's worried that the economy will be the reason he won't get reelected.  All his promises are not being kept. He's putting himself before us.
6470 2018-12-21 15:14:04 WHITE HOUSE bans bump stocks!!! First sensible thing that psychopath has done.
6471 2018-12-21 15:14:03 So you gave them the ban on bump stocks and you couldn’t get the wall!  That didn’t work so give back the bump stocks and shove it into their faces. We are tired of them controlling our country with their leftist agenda.
6472 2018-12-21 15:13:53 US stocks are down in 2018.  But, the US economy grew +3.4% in Q3. The Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank predicts +3.0 growth in Q4.  We should end up ~3% for 2018.  The Leading Economic Index grew 0.2% in Nov. showing continued economic growth.  Unemployment rate is at 3.7%.
6473 2018-12-21 15:13:44 At this rate it would take 58 years to reach that goal. Please leave the stocks in my name.

6481 2018-12-21 15:12:17 interesting. I assumed that the blood loss would end along with tax loss selling but It may take a serious U spot bid to move uranium stocks back up.

6578 2018-12-21 14:44:36 These morons (GOP) should be more concerned about the awful state of the economy and how it is in free fall instead of wasting time with political games. The Stocks Markets are at a loss for the entire year suffering the worst month & economic quarter since the Great Depression.
6579 2018-12-21 14:44:35 Hmm ok. I'll tru to speak on the bowser jr discord tonight to get advices for the recovery. I lose a lot of stocks because I dont get my upb back as I get hit after my first upb
6580 2018-12-21 14:44:34 Mnuchin says stocks are cheap. Take it from him. He makes movies. But at least they are green for now. Can we close the market now so we have an up day.
6581 2018-12-21 14:44:15 Well the tariffs on China are looking great, the stocks prove that. Russia, that’s a whole different end of the spectrum, collusion much?
6582 2018-12-21 14:44:13 Ridiculous false equivalencies are childish. Ban shoelaces
You idiot trolls with the shoelaces!!! Then why the long long long wait to ban bump stocks McGyver??? Because...lobbyists threatening elected officials with funding superpacs to run attack ads against them in primaries.
6583 2018-12-21 14:43:20 David, knows nothing other than the rhetoric he is told to spew by his handler father. Just as he didn't know that the NRA was the first to approve of the banning of bump stocks.

6586 2018-12-21 14:42:44 Still crazy how all these stocks are hitting 52 week lows
6587 2018-12-21 14:42:34  b/c everything else is going so well?
•The stocks are down over the ENTIRE year.
•Trump is in major trouble
•Russia is expanding into Mediterranean now
•Trade war is seriously hurting Americans
Why not a shutdown?

6590 2018-12-21 14:41:59 Amazing & VERY disheartening to witness how journalism, to be for the benefit of our country, has disintegrated into "infotainment" & serves only the wealthy via stocks & revenue.
6591 2018-12-21 14:40:57 Stocks have been going up & down since the begining...nothing new.  Everyone knows stocks r a gamble.  invest in real estate instead.... MAGA!
6592 2018-12-21 14:40:31 media bias is on full display with Trump getting bump stocks banned (which were made legal under Obama) and prison reform which Obama campaigned on.

im not a fan of the bumpstock ban in principal, but had Barry done either, the media would wet themselves praising him.
6593 2018-12-21 14:40:17 US #Stocks are trading cautiously higher at the open

6614 2018-12-21 14:36:29 I don't really care about bump stocks, but I 100% disagree with the Trump administrations decision to ban them with executive action.  
1.  It is not constitutional
2. It sets a dangerous precedent
3.  You can get the same results by using your belt loop or a rubber band

6638 2018-12-21 14:29:44 Actually, they were willing from the beginning to throw bump stocks under the bus to protect larger and more lucrative interests. It's like when a lizard drops it's tail to distract a predator while it tries to escape.  Except, it won't work.

6650 2018-12-21 14:27:05 I think the stock market is based on investor sentiment in the short term and on real earnings in the long run. Stocks have been trading at above average earnings multiples for YEARS because interest rates were so low and there was no other option.

6662 2018-12-21 14:24:44 Ms Nancy, please we need your strength now more than ever. No wall, such a waste of money. Save our Social Security, it’s all a lot of old people like my hubby & I have. No stocks no savings. We sit in pain worrying about how hard it is for our grown kids to make ends meet.
6663 2018-12-21 14:24:30 It’s funny.  When stocks are going up, “the economy is strong”.  When the market corrects, which shouldn’t surprise anyone, “the Fed is a disaster”.  

If the economy can’t handle 2.5% Funds and 3% TNX, it was fragile to begin with.  

So the market rally was bullshit
6664 2018-12-21 14:24:22 All this coverage is missing all the positive stories from yesterday! Just before saying @POTUS should reject malign actors and embrace democratic allies, Mattis said DoD is on a "more sound budgetary footing." And the 2% drop in the DJIA means stocks are less expensive to buy!
6665 2018-12-21 14:24:11 Maybe Pelosi too old, too staid, or too invested in oil stocks.  The GREEN NEW DEAL smoked with VISION, YOUTH, and KENNEDY-ESQUE AMBITION.  He got us to the moon in ten years by challenging us. And Dems can’t do as much to save the planet? They may be surprised 2020.
6666 2018-12-21 14:23:23 So dishonorable on your part.  Blow up their lives for a small political win on an outdated security system, an old world wall. Stocks have fallen over your rash behavior. You’ve don’t nothing but evil this week. Bah humbug, Mr. President. Dawn is coming.

6673 2018-12-21 14:20:42 I will continually speak strongly against the mandate to destroy private property without compensation without legislative/judicial branches weighing in. Regardless of what one's opinion is about bump stocks it is overreach violating the sovereignty of the states & individuals.

On the bright side India et al were independent within a few years though, of course, they were a lot poorer by then.
6699 2018-12-21 14:13:31 Making a niche product even more niche just check on stocks response was not what they expected, even I thought it was good.
6700 2018-12-21 14:13:29 @AskRobinhood why can I not scroll past more than 50 stocks in my portfolio when scrolling individual stocks from left to right ? Can you fix this ? Also your app is pretty twitchy since your money management upgrade. @RobinhoodApp
6701 2018-12-21 14:12:29 Investment gone wrong smh .. Even stocks come with warnings ..
6702 2018-12-21 14:10:59 Selling some more $SPY $QQQ. A slightly green open in a bear market is often the easiest sell setup. Nobody wants to own stocks into year-end with all that tax-loss selling and massive uncertainty regarding Fed policy, trade war, shutdown.

6716 2018-12-21 14:07:24 Notice that FAANG stocks, which led the current decline, have made higher lows.  Leaders in strength became leaders in weakness, and now turning again.

6722 2018-12-21 14:04:21 Most of us don't own stocks, but what happens on Wall Street affects us.  People who work there are required to pay close attention to economic trends, and they're telling us they look like recession ahead:  "A DECLINE OF 20 PERCENT MARKS THE OFFICIAL START OF A BEAR MARKET."

6725 2018-12-21 14:03:48 Aren't stocks fundamentally overvalued? I doubt it that these selling sessions are because of technical analysis, people are withdrawing because we are at the peak and everybody wants sell before the next recession

6732 2018-12-21 14:00:59 Tamir Rice. Oh and good job getting bump stocks banned. Everybody is really excited about your influence.
6733 2018-12-21 14:00:52 Obama said we should thank him for low gas prices and of course when the stocks were rising, now the stocks are slowing down it’s all Trumps fault. #NeverTrump #TrumpsFault  Could it be because the Dems are not focused America first and bringing down Trump?
6734 2018-12-21 14:00:37 Lots of stocks up pre-market as they move over hourly chart mid BB. Very likely will pull back to this mid BB so be careful if you play calls. As I said premiums too high so OTM on both sides will drop as day goes. Wait. Patience pays off.

6737 2018-12-21 13:59:32 If you had polled investors on 10/1 “Which will do better in 2018, stocks or bonds?” there would have been nary a backer for bonds. Life comes at you fast. Markets come at you faster. Predicting is hard.
6738 2018-12-21 13:58:30 Funny how the Dems never noticed when the stock market kept going up and now all of a sudden there has been a down turn #Schumer and the rest of the Trump haters are blaming Trump. You never can please these folks, when stocks were going great they didn’t like it.

6742 2018-12-21 13:56:40 Right? Bump stocks were dangerous toys. I’m pro-bump stock and I don’t like turning citizens into criminals. But we survived lawn dart bans too. And our soldiers are coming home!!!
6743 2018-12-21 13:56:35 Quick way to make a buck:

1. Invest in the market (strictly blue chip stocks)
2. Watch your investment grow!
3. Disinvest after learning about bitcoin
4. Fuck Bitcoin throw it all into LuLaRoe and let it ride
5. Also you’re a dj now

free rein in the vacuum of power.

Sorry about your crappy, speculative stocks.
6746 2018-12-21 13:56:11 Stocks continue to falter, possible recession looming. @realDonaldTrump constantly brags about the booming stock market, but anyone with any sense could and can see that it is a big bubble, ready to pop. Has Trump set his own trap with his hubris? We shall see.

6757 2018-12-21 13:51:21 Stocks always fall this time of year and the interest rates that were artificially held down are being raised. If they did not do that, the trend would have continued. Don't sell, it'll come right back and beyond. The glass is half full and filling.
6758 2018-12-21 13:51:20 Chinese stocks look cheap versus with those on Wall Street. Following the big sell-off this year,the Shanghai Composite is trading at an almost 40% discount to the Dow.

6761 2018-12-21 13:50:38 I don’t necessarily think its priced in, chart wise it speaks to the contrary, but its all up to the market and if they wanna play the stocks after the news
6762 2018-12-21 13:50:29 Lot of stocks starting to look attractive. Energy has been smashed. IMO, we are close to a bottom assuming something or someone doesn’t.............. you know.

6764 2018-12-21 13:48:31 Many stocks undervalued and stretched too low. Still a few mega caps and high flying momentum tech that have come down but may need further to go. Let’s see that final flush of 10% lower for major indices, get the pain over with and start bull market 2.0

6770 2018-12-21 13:46:26 Hi Mark, After I read your book, I have a question about the downside of the market is a good timing to find the next leading stocks. But sometimes it is only suitable for no position or for doing short, could I know how do you distinguish?
6771 2018-12-21 13:45:40 It is just a matter of time.  You will be feeling sorry for you.  Stocks are already hitting rock bottom
6772 2018-12-21 13:45:23 Hasn't he warned that "stocks are not cheap relative to bonds?" I see no contradiction.

6798 2018-12-21 13:34:03 Well, if you read my feed, you'll see it's just one of *many* issues I discuss. Stocks are important psychologically, though, and if the drop accelerates, it could (along w other factors) cut into support for Trump and the GOP which will impact how they govern (and if they can).
6799 2018-12-21 13:33:40 Time to sell? 
Is this correction like 2001 and 2008 or ‘95, ‘11, ‘16? 2001 and ‘08 stocks lost 50% of value. It took 3-4 years to recover. Technical corrections can go too far and effect overall economic sentiment causing a slowdown.

6802 2018-12-21 13:32:06 Trump wants the wall bc he’s worked hard to put all of his stocks in order to profit from it. He chose private contractor, told his buddies which company to invest in. If you don’t let him build it Chuck, he won’t make a profit and that’s bad for Trump- which is all that matters.
6803 2018-12-21 13:31:05 Got a meeting this morning at UMass/Lowell, so will miss the morning's stock trading. Dow Futures currently DOWN 0.30%. Can't imagine who would WANT to invest today & hold stocks thru THIS weekend! Have to guess another 2% loss day coming.

And that last half hour could be steep!
6804 2018-12-21 13:30:58 Trump: I'm banning Trans people from the military!
Also Trump: I'm also pulling us out of the middle east.
Also also Trump: I want to repeal the clean water act
Also Trump: I'm doing criminal justice reform 
Also Trump: I'm banning bump stocks
Trump: Industrial hemp is legal tho

6817 2018-12-21 13:26:16 But you kept saying buy stocks, "amazing opportunities" I believe.
6818 2018-12-21 13:25:59 Everything is bullish! Please go buy some stocks...

Bump stocks are stupid toys for the easily amused and these clowns are forcing me to defend them.
6820 2018-12-21 13:25:42 The stocks keep going so damn low but hasnt stopped yet. If it would stabilize and go slower. At least maybe even start going up but its just going down down and super fast lol.

6822 2018-12-21 13:24:38 I moved my 401k  money into a stable fund two days ago...predominately bonds. The markets have become way too volatile for my taste. I do not believe the descent is over...will reinvest in stocks when I see significant changes.
6823 2018-12-21 13:24:28 Sir, any benefits of this WhatsApp messages to option traders ? I am a pure option trader( small). I don't follow any stocks.

6825 2018-12-21 13:24:17 And the opportunist says....income producing stocks are advantageously priced to pick up more shares and increase both my average yield as well as annual div/into income. Oh yeah...and we're one day closer to Spring.
6826 2018-12-21 13:24:06 @coyote73 Likely to remain oversold for a long time; too many broken stocks for a big bounce, rather lengthy base building! $SPX $RUT $DJIA
6827 2018-12-21 13:23:53 IT stocks dropped. TCS (down 3.02%), Wipro (down 4.23%), HCL  Technologies (down 0.34%), Tech Mahindra (down 1.45%), Oracle Financial  Services Software (down 0.27%), MindTree (down 0.29%), Hexaware  Technologies (down 2.76%) and Mphasis (down 2.18%) declined.
6828 2018-12-21 13:23:41 Only Jesse knows what he's thinking lol, but I'm assuming Jesse thinks the market will rebound. I think the big stocks in the market are diverged wayyyyy over their main MA's.... Due for some pullback, but then every time I called a short on this market.... It continued higher
6829 2018-12-21 13:23:20 I was up at 3:30. Couldn’t get back to sleep. Gave up & came into work. Got here @ 5:45. 1st thing I did was get online & move my entire 401K out of stocks. That, I have some control over. But the international stage being set for future war with Russia &/or China? Terrifying.
6830 2018-12-21 13:22:59 All the major sectors like Auto, Metal, Tech, Cement, Banking and NBFC stocks declined sharply.
6831 2018-12-21 13:22:55 Stock market is nervous the Fed. Reserve & a 5th interest rate inc. and tech stocks. The capital invested and planned is a big deal for us. Jobs were actually above expectation but it is the type of jobs that is most important. The ACA turned full time into 30 hrs.= part-time job
6832 2018-12-21 13:22:44 Investors depended on the FED to prop up stocks? How sad. Clearly, central banks' financial engineering stunts were bound to end badly.  It is about time stock price came back down to earth.
6833 2018-12-21 13:22:39 Technicals point to lower lows. If you are still in, probably stay because we may have a short snap back rally. But in the medium term, we will see the tech, financial and bio pharma stocks lower with great opportunity to buy! #2019
6834 2018-12-21 13:22:18 We'll see. I suspect a lot of the semi stocks can double from current depressed levels.
6835 2018-12-21 13:21:41 Kevin - while it is possible - me thinks everyone likes a bargain and too many stocks are trading at a healthy discount to not warrant some nibbling. $46 for a barrel of Oil means a gallon of gas will cost $1 and change soon. US TSY 10 Year note has declined 50 bps - 2.76%.
6836 2018-12-21 13:21:26 Reading some LSE BB's reinforces the view, trading/investing in stocks should come with a health warning.  It aint easy in these markets but it will turn at some juncture...
6837 2018-12-21 13:20:58 Indian equities ended lower today, tracking broader Asian markets, as investor sentiments dipped due to weaker global cues triggered by overnight weakness on Wall Street. All sectoral indices ended in red today, with Auto, IT and realty stocks emerging as the biggest losers.
6838 2018-12-21 13:20:51 These morons (GOP) should be more concerned about the awful state of the economy and how it is in free fall instead of wasting time with political games. The Stocks Markets are at a loss for the entire year suffering the worst month & economic quarter since the Great Depression.

Bump stocks are really a technique.  Which can be made with a piece of memory foam. Are they banning that?
6842 2018-12-21 13:18:57 I think that expectations went down a bit, after all lots of stocks fell by 25-50 %, thats a serious move. Regarding CB liquidity - my bet is that 2019 will see the peak in tightening and probably go neutral with the risk of going into easing again. Look at China, already easing.
6843 2018-12-21 13:17:50 The Republicans have always thought they had a grip on the economy! They never do! What a mess.. stocks in turmoil, deficit highest ever and a government shut down looming. This is "Making America Great Again "? SAD!!!!!
6844 2018-12-21 13:17:38 Hey, now you can buy blue chip stocks at cheaper price.
6845 2018-12-21 13:16:45 Stocks and economy are tanking.

Butta, butta, her emails...
6846 2018-12-21 13:16:40 If stocks are lower, people spend less. If real estate is lower, people spend less.  Interest rates higher, people have less.If we already had the best of these and the unemployment was basically at a 50 year low, why would we think the economy will be better any time soon?

6848 2018-12-21 13:15:50 Bump stocks are for those that have a lazy finger, neither can acheive automatic fire.
Most people who know how to shoot understand this.
2nd Amendment allows you to bear arms, and to be equal to those in power.
Ie law inforcement weaponary, Hench why Military shall never be used
6849 2018-12-21 13:15:48 Yeah, I'm not sure about a huge reset either. A retrace, maybe with stocks doing poorly while cryptos pick up it's slack seems more likely. From there, crypto can slowly take over more aspects in the economy. This is my hope in any case, a reset will hurt many people.
6850 2018-12-21 13:15:33 According to Fed--it's Trump who's put market in crisis. And Wall St gets unintended consequences for looking for different ways to pump stocks. There will always be government corruption but with Trump it is a requirement.
6851 2018-12-21 13:15:30 I bet your the type of person to not even know why it’s happening. I’m sry you may not understand but there is a balance of power. And the FED just raised Interest rates if u wanted to know why stocks are falling.
6852 2018-12-21 13:14:29 And I’m sure the NRA will help her violate the Constitution, like you did with the bump stocks.  Shame on you NRA
6853 2018-12-21 13:14:13 21% gains are unrealistic returns.  Congrats.  It sounds like you’ve benefited from one of the longest bull markets in history, and shit load of luck. Stocks have been overinflated for a while.  Corrections have been needed.
6854 2018-12-21 13:14:11 There will always be wars as lind as we use oil. Politicians have stocks in it. Greedy as hell
6855 2018-12-21 13:13:44 Remember January 2016?  Republican majorities in both houses and the Presidency!  We could have rolled back the NFA, legalized suppressors, passed concealed carry reciprocity. . .instead we got a ban on bump stocks. @realDonaldTrump @DLoesch
6856 2018-12-21 13:13:44 Got to start investing bro that compound interest is no joke and divide your pay check in percentages (6 jar system). Money builds up fast when you split your money into multiple accounts that pays interest and buying stocks that pay dividend.
6857 2018-12-21 13:13:41 stocks rise by 1%.
6858 2018-12-21 13:13:32 Not touching it any time soon. There will be many years down the line to play US mj stocks, right now no need to rush in, can easily go under 10 next

6864 2018-12-21 13:08:46 The tide may finally be turning on Trump sycophancy. Stocks are down.  The tax cut is in the rear view mirror. And tariffs are hurting the economy. He has served his purpose, and things are going sour fast.

6872 2018-12-21 13:06:06 In a bit of an irony, the more painful this is, the more bullish on oil I become. You are starting to see deep value quality E&P stocks quit going down as they sniff out the recovery.
6873 2018-12-21 13:06:00 Here’s another. He wanted 5 billion but he wasn’t going to be able to walk out of the Oval holding a briefcase. Instead he manipulated the markets. Shorted stocks and took the 5 billion home washed and ready to use.  This whole time it was a game of smoke and mirrors.

6880 2018-12-21 13:04:34 Yep ! A little bit expensive yet it's worth it. The merchandise they sell varies, depends on the stocks that'll come, I went there earlier and they are lacking in items of some characters ( shooky, RJ, Mang standing dolls :( ).
6881 2018-12-21 13:03:47 There’s really no reason to worry about ur 401k for years. You should be invested in extremely risk stocks at ur age. As long as u keep increasing ur share numbers ur fine.
6882 2018-12-21 13:03:13 Until the USD breaks the pain in stocks will continue. Goon squad trying to win playing by their own rules, using oil as a stealth QE or ZIRP if you will, to stimulate the economy while pretending it doesn't need it. Let the supply destruction begin. #WeekendAtBernies

6922 2018-12-21 12:51:01 Europe’s crisis is escalating fast. The rout in financial markets is on track to break records.

6929 2018-12-21 12:49:19 I sat down with @fred_guttenberg to discuss the federal commission on school safety and President Trump's recent ban on bump stocks. Tune into @HillTVLive in the 8 am hour for the full interview.
6930 2018-12-21 12:48:40 Stocks weak again in PM. I'm shocked #sarcasm
#FAANG, $AAPL, $AMZN, $NFLX, $FB, $QQQ, $GOOG, $BABA, $NVDA
6931 2018-12-21 12:46:51 I have my doubts leaving Syria is a good idea. I don’t know a ton about guns. I believe banning bump stocks is a good idea. Rights have responsibilities, Jay. I’m a gun sense girl, not control . Background check system isn’t working .
6932 2018-12-21 12:46:31 What are the rules on Chinese regulators investing in stocks?

6936 2018-12-21 12:44:23 I own stocks.  That orange putz is completely tanking them and the 401K. Trump has not been good for this economy.  I won't even mention how my fellow Iowans in the farming community feel right now.
6937 2018-12-21 12:43:50 pag yumaman talaga ako sm bibilhin ko stocks niyo
6938 2018-12-21 12:43:34 Stocks have plummeted, Mattis resigned because he couldn’t put up with your BS, you’re in bed with Russia, your base loves guns, you’re destroying the environment, taking away health care & so much more. This is the America you’re creating...
6939 2018-12-21 12:42:39 Remember when you said you were going to make everyone rich?!?       I just read (& have seen) the latest news:  This year has been the worst for world stock markets since the 2008 global financial crisis, with MSCI's 47-country world stocks index down 10 percent.  Any response??
6940 2018-12-21 12:41:08 Biggest market myth of 2018 that you’ve heard a million times:  higher rates are good for bank stocks.

6942 2018-12-21 12:38:59 The stocks and rotten tomatoes first!
6943 2018-12-21 12:38:46 Lol @ the NPC for thinking it takes 10 years to get policies to take effect on the US economy. Obama's economy was 50 mil food stamps, 100 mil out of work, 1.9% GDP and printing money to prop the stock market up :)  Stocks falling because no free money and democRATs taking house
6944 2018-12-21 12:38:12 Is there anybody that has not already noticed a 25% - 35% increase in prices for food at the in the last 6 to 12 month?

6946 2018-12-21 12:37:33 More market manipulation so his enriched tax break recipients can purchase more stocks at artificially deflated price... add that to investigation @SEC_News
6947 2018-12-21 12:37:28 You’re becoming one of the biggest laughing stocks in the Republican so cold party
6948 2018-12-21 12:37:22 True, but if you own individual stocks then the draw down has been much worse.
6949 2018-12-21 12:37:21 $GLD $SLV don't expect anything out of a government shutdown. Perhaps the dollar fades a bit but what really matters is January. Sentiment great for (gold/silver) & stocks crushed IMO. Next fed meeting will be a much different tone if S&P is in the 2100-2300 range. Fed put engage
6950 2018-12-21 12:35:49 Depends what he says. If he tries to spin the meeting as dovish stocks might like it, & vice versa

I thought it was likely we would see an economy collapse around 2020 but could be sooner.

6957 2018-12-21 12:33:15 I find it depressingly ironic because now here he is moving to ban bump stocks and Mattis is resigning and these were like the two main things conservatives worshipped him for the opposite of so rip
6958 2018-12-21 12:33:07 Just 5 #FANG stocks make up 48% of the QQQ ETF (AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, GOOG, FB). The recent 20% drawdown wiped out nearly $1.6T across 605 ETFs and funds which own these five stocks.

However (and It hurts to point this out)

12 of the top 15 positions in the Action Alerts PLUS portfolio are seriously RED. Roughly avg. 10-12% losses.  

Yes, the market sucks and those are good stocks. But really? Time to re-evaluate?

6971 2018-12-21 12:26:53 So banning bump stocks equates to eventually banning guns? Your statement is a quintessential example of a slippery slope.
6972 2018-12-21 12:26:32 Some maybe confused as to why $SPY is trading "down" while the #futures are gapping higher today.  There was a #dividend issued on December 21, 2019 in the amount of $1.435 per share. #wallst #StockMarket #stocks #ES_F $ES_F

For a giant wall on the southern border.  That we don't need, that won't stop crime, that won't even stop immigration and that this giant fucking baby promised he could get Mexico to pay for.

Congratulations, Republicans.  Your champion.  Your prophet.

6980 2018-12-21 12:23:09 not sure if it because im working too hard(god I never know handling stocks for 5outlets can be this stress) or jangkit from staff or cousin but I also down with flu & fever 
6981 2018-12-21 12:23:02 The issue is, my money was in stocks...
6982 2018-12-21 12:22:52 If Fed keeps rates low, then "rich people win" because stocks are propped up.

If Fed raises rates then "rich people win" because they get juicy passive income without lifting a finger.

Looks like owning assets is a good deal.
We can complain, or we can get busy...

6986 2018-12-21 12:20:57 Tariff Man -

Stocks tumbled today as investors fretted over a growing list of concerns, including slowing economic growth, trade policy and the threat of a U.S. government shutdown.

The Dow lost 464 points to close at 22,860, the lowest since Oct 2017

How’s your 401k?  Idiot!
6987 2018-12-21 12:20:38 And PSG think they can get Weigl at €20mn and none of the top players are making a bidding war out of it already? His stocks have fallen dramatically
6988 2018-12-21 12:20:16 Just when you thought Congress had their shit together by passing the 1st criminal justice reform bill, they manage to miraculously find $5.7b to fund an asinine “border security wall” as stocks tumble and U.S. deficit soars to unprecedented amounts. 

I can smell a recession.
6989 2018-12-21 12:19:46 MUTANT MASS SALE!!!! ONLY WHILE STOCKS LAST....BOOM!!!!  — feeling festive
6990 2018-12-21 12:18:33 Yeah that's why Trump FINALLY did something about bump stocks. Which you extremists opposed through lobbying threats to both sides of Congress. Lobbyists...deceitful to the end.
6991 2018-12-21 12:17:45 Every two years we have a chance to rebuild the government to the way we want it. How many mass  shootings where is committed using bump-stocks? Let’s see what the House says about the “ criminal justice reform bill.” Stop f-cking crying!
6992 2018-12-21 12:16:57 If you have any $, which I’d bet ANYTHING you don’t, you’d be plunking down huge chunks on these stocks being sold, as they’ll be skyrocketing soon, as the same people taking goins, will be buying right back in 2 weeks.
6993 2018-12-21 12:16:50 Buy buy buy stocks....bubble burst is temporary.(i hope)this world wide crisis is spreading like fire,there is recession everywhere, but can't be seen by the naked eye though. Malls, restaurants and bars are still flocking with spenders.
6994 2018-12-21 12:16:42 Is that why they finally banned bump stocks?
6995 2018-12-21 12:16:21 Sounds sensible to me.

Would you prefer we didn't have such stocks? Why?
6996 2018-12-21 12:16:09 Not trying to take away guns from people, but ban the sale and ownership of certain guns and bump stocks. More double talk bs from the clueless left.
6997 2018-12-21 12:15:48 We in London won't do too badly for a while. We can subsist on those Fatbergs in the sewers (while stocks last).

7001 2018-12-21 12:14:59 Shared stocks may well require mutual agreement, but if we have our own government setting the rules for UK and only dealing with our own quotas, we can as RA have more say than we do with the EU. We do need more from the tackle trade though.

7009 2018-12-21 12:10:57 But he gave into China with nothing in return.
Stocks are tanking.
Mattis did rage quit due to Trumps incompetence and arrogance.

So all true.
7010 2018-12-21 12:10:31 If you have money saved from earlier rally upto Oct 2018 then invest only in some bluechip stocks who have come down significantly. Do own research and invest. Do not jump for intraday trade in bear market.
7011 2018-12-21 12:10:18 Stocks fall when the Fed even mentions they’re going to raise rates.  So when I do raise rates stocks go down.
7012 2018-12-21 12:06:52 My question is:  Will there be an accounting of how many "Bump stocks" are turned in?  I have the Under.
7013 2018-12-21 12:06:22 Ask yourself, are you everything you could/want (to) be. Its an interesting question and a useful conversation to have with yourself. What it can lead to?...... #Stocks #Living

7018 2018-12-21 12:03:25 That's the spirit! Yes, but it's about critical mass - once the national press get onto this fiasco they will be little sympathy for academia in this current climate. Money that could be improving society is going into stocks and shares. Wrong, plain and simple!!!!

7020 2018-12-21 12:02:55 This can't be allowed to happen & the bump stocks are not just a slippery slope they're a cliff with an avalanche behind us
7021 2018-12-21 12:02:19 If you listen to the video those were machine guns. They weren't bump stocks. They are LYING to us about what happened in Vegas. Even if he did use them that don't justify taking them away from those that legally bought them. Same old knee jerk gun control reaction.

7032 2018-12-21 11:54:57 Maybe its because people are stuffed into the same ETFs and STOCKS. Margin call selling speeds it all up.

The sad and pathetic part is your butt just couldn’t wait to jump at an opportunity to argue and debate me when Republicans are many of the Americans who are being adversely impacted the worst. Folk have no heath care. Farms and stocks depreciated.
7036 2018-12-21 11:51:57 A great christmas present would be the markets starting to embrace the controversial uranium sector just like it did with the cannabis sector.

Since uranium stocks respond more to the general markets than the spot price, this would surely help the sector to break free.

7045 2018-12-21 11:46:19 The interest on the almost 0% loans rises to where it eats the profits from the stocks... market will stabilize then head north again /2
7046 2018-12-21 11:44:55 Part of it is the fed continues to raise interest rates making bonds more attractive & making the dollar stronger but remember Obama was at 17k & interest rates were near zero... that almost “free” money went into stocks now they’re profit taking to pay down debt before /1
7047 2018-12-21 11:42:54 Our view is that #stocks will continue to trade poorly until either 1) #fed actually turns dovish 2) improvement in #tradewars 3) economic data inflicts higher.  None of these look imminent so we prefer risk off in the short term.
7048 2018-12-21 11:41:24 so boring. simple fact. 3000 stocks and 15000 HF managers makes for a bad business.

7054 2018-12-21 11:39:10 Everyone should be distressed.  Trump thinks that this is a game.  We are becoming laughing stocks on the world stage.
7055 2018-12-21 11:38:56 No.
Accurate: #stocks - long a bubble, stocks soaring while incomes near-flat and high percent of current working incomes nil - were a bursting bubble quite a while before this week.
7056 2018-12-21 11:38:00 Hahahaha
7057 2018-12-21 11:36:44 You had absolutely nothing to do with bump stocks being banned, you disingenuous little minge.
7058 2018-12-21 11:36:28 We've had our last delivery of roasts. Come in and grab one whilst stocks last! :)

7064 2018-12-21 11:28:00 (continued) but most likely not do a single thing to reduce deaths considering criminals could buy a bump stock illegally or, as you suggested, make their own. So yeah, I’m sold on your point - BUMP STOCKS FOR THE WIN AGAINST TYRANNY!
7065 2018-12-21 11:27:56 the gop = military industrial complex stocks & oil stock portfolio's. They vote lock step for THEIR interests, not America's.
7066 2018-12-21 11:27:24 Good morning. Uk stocks f**** me. Maybe it is ok to long some now.
7067 2018-12-21 11:27:17 #France Stocks: Realty $URW -3%. Pharma $SAN -2.7%. SuperMart #Carrefour -2.5%. Banks $ACA -2.4%. Electrical $RXL -1.5%. Train Tech #Alstom -3.1%. Recycle $RX -4.2%. Defense $HO -1.2%. Liquor $RCO -2.1%. Plastics $POM +3.8%. Mountain Infra $CDA +3%. Real Estate $MERY -2.6%.
7068 2018-12-21 11:27:13 Yeah okay. Bump stocks do reduce the accuracy of the rifle a lot and how many people have used one to kill (probably less than the media hypes it up) so i guess taking it off law abiding owners (which I never wanted in the first instance) would not only violate the 2nd Ammendment
7069 2018-12-21 11:26:59 Wala pang 2 weeks since we launched, naka limang replenish na kami ng stocks. Huhu thank you pilipins.

7072 2018-12-21 11:25:50 When the stock market crashes and you lose 8k in stocks in two days, better believe I’m getting drunk this weekend 
7073 2018-12-21 11:24:27 What an amazing show of support from Orchard Toys Ltd to get us fresh stocks in today when we only contacted them yesterday. Another great reason to pop in to Crocodile. #shoplocal
7074 2018-12-21 11:22:13 I'd tie them to a chair in a field, and use a Roman catapult to fling fresh cowpats at them, or putting them into a set of stocks and throwing rotten fruit and vegetables at them. AND getting them to clean up the mess afterwards!
7075 2018-12-21 11:21:16 I think the guy who did the shooting in Vegas caused bump stocks to be banned. You need to wake up little dude.
7076 2018-12-21 11:20:11 Global stocks drop on growth fears, imminent U.S. government shutdown. Global stocks continued a sharp selloff on Friday as global growth concerns and the pending closure of the U.S. government continued to weigh on risk appetite.
7077 2018-12-21 11:19:46 Was sitting next to an older Australian chap on the plane y’day. He worked the stocks & was well read on minerals req’d for EV mass prod. I asked him about Bitcoin. He said in Oz they currently use more electricity to mine (super computers running 24/7) than they are worth!
7078 2018-12-21 11:19:41 Sea angling in England is worth more than fin-fishing by miles. If we can get the tackle trade on board we will outgun commercial reps.

7080 2018-12-21 11:18:54 POLL: Do you support President Trump’s ban on bump stocks, a gun modification that allows semiautomatic rifles to fire faster?
7081 2018-12-21 11:18:14 I developed a computer program to trade risk markets ( commodities Metals, energy, stocks, bonds, Fx etc)  without human interference. My program is very successful with a proven very successful track record. So rest assured you are very wrong as to my knowledge and it’s sources.
7082 2018-12-21 11:16:33 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to cure your ADHD
7083 2018-12-21 11:14:30 Were you with Coaster Unit at Riverport? Hearing all kinds of rumors that Jack Joyce chatted about stocks on his own.
7084 2018-12-21 11:13:13 Still have big pillows but only Koya,RJ,Shooky,Mang and Van I guess. I don’t know if they still have stocks
7085 2018-12-21 11:12:38 On a more serious note, however, many people who were put in the stocks or the pillory were slaughtered by mobs. #Manicfesto
7086 2018-12-21 11:11:25 Also I’d argue that no targets would suit your profiled firm in the sector at the moment none cheap for sure. I reason in terms of deleveraging potential, timing, seasonality, $ strength etc. A TA & Quant mix to wait for a pattern I have seen in commodity stocks for many years.
7087 2018-12-21 11:11:24 Yeah but what percentage of their wealth do stocks represent for the remaining 90% of the people?
7088 2018-12-21 11:11:10 He banned bump stocks...can you work with anyone that doesn't agree with you? No you can't and its obvious how hypocritical you are...@SenSanders why are tax payers going to pay for healthcare for a bunch of fat diabetcis
7089 2018-12-21 11:09:31 Oh cheers mate! Yeah blocked by the baggie! Guess he didn’t like me talking about short his lithium stocks. A short is a short when it’s a short as much as a long is true for the reverse!  baggies gonna block! It’s just how they roll!

7091 2018-12-21 11:08:03 I've been buying Gold producing companies btw, not trading the physical metal.
They have all done really well over the last month or so, even when the POG dropped down almost $20 in one night. 
Shows strength in the Gold producer stocks.

7094 2018-12-21 11:07:19 Island economies do not threaten fish stocks, or habitat...
It's the international trawlers, many of which are Taiwanese, and North American.
7095 2018-12-21 11:07:04 Ideally one should build a retirement corpus consisting of stocks, mutual funds, ULIPs, PPF, etc.
7096 2018-12-21 11:05:49 I own almost all stocks with awesome balance & dividends, the fall of them are extreme in many cases
7097 2018-12-21 11:05:04 why would he say “there” 4 times if there are only 3 stocks...?
7098 2018-12-21 11:05:02 Actually doing something worthwhile.
I'm shocked.

Now if you could just understand banning bump stocks doesn't solve anything...
7099 2018-12-21 11:04:35 Depends on how much of the wealth of the other 90% is in stocks...
7100 2018-12-21 11:04:22 Stocks definitely affect you believe it or not. If you live in the US, because who else watches NBC, a federal government shutdown affects you. The DoJ suffering a crisis can also affect you.
7101 2018-12-21 11:04:11 El acrónimo FIFO viene de First In First Out (en economía estudié esto, y algo recuerdo aun xD), se usa sobre todo en los stocks de las tiendas, lo primero que entra es lo primero que sale, y así mantienen, sobre todo en supermercados, las fechas de caducidad.
7102 2018-12-21 11:04:11 @MaCoqueFr Cette société ne semble pas réaliser que la demande est plus important sur la période de Noel, ne gère pas ses stocks correctement, et n'a aucun scrupule a priver des enfants de cadeaux. Aucun avoir ni geste commercial proposé. Plus jamais !
7103 2018-12-21 11:03:48 Fake drone story.

7109 2018-12-21 11:00:22 The dummy said he's not turning in his, now illegal, bump stocks.  He's the criminal. He's the criminal who still has an illegal item. This isn't too complicated
7110 2018-12-21 11:00:08 Anyone interested in buying a brand new water bed for more than half of it's original price, which is 15k?

7111 2018-12-21 10:58:43 We have been blessed with so many donations of clothes and over the past few months that our stocks are now full to over-flowing! Thank you everyone. Please share anything now with the foodbanks, Salvation Army or charity shops.
7112 2018-12-21 10:56:11 Market indexes are "averages" and the average can't lead, because it's the average.  Individual stocks will lead on the upside and the downside. Learn to trade stocks properly and you will always be ahead of the market leaving people scratching their heads wonder how you did it.
7113 2018-12-21 10:56:08 Today morning I just brought some stocks that's holding now ... Thanks for your reply sir

7120 2018-12-21 10:47:39 As per my observation fno strong stocks retrace below rsi 30 hourly and then reverse. On top side above 75 hourly they go in pull back. Same is with index. And then they reverse.
7121 2018-12-21 10:46:41 Stocks Fall, Yields Fall...... Sounds like money is seeking safety trades. You'd think it was 2009 again. Lucky "The Economy" isn't having any problems.

GDP: Up
Unemployment: Down
Wages: Up
Inflation: Down

Main Street says, "Boom"
The Market says, "Bust"

7132 2018-12-21 10:37:43 Dodaću samo da ovo uništava štednju(veštački niske kamatne stope), tako i akumulaciju kapitala koja je bitna za kapitalne investicije, a ohrabruje zaduživanje i ulaganje u rizične assets, stocks, junk bonds u potrazi za kakvim takvim profitom, što je jako opasno.

7136 2018-12-21 10:35:04 I wasn't sure at first.. Then after a bit in the glass.. Am in agreement. WIll grab more tonight while stocks last!
7137 2018-12-21 10:33:54 The range of early US high frequency indicators suggest that, while not dramatic right now, US #markets are yet to find an internal and/or external circuit breaker:

Futures point to weaker stocks at the open, the VIX is higher,the yield curve flatter and the 10-year yield lower.
7138 2018-12-21 10:33:27 dude, might as well go like tomorrow never dies, but the  other version, dude, but when you spell stacks it goes, you can't do that trick with stocks, but with the german word, it seems, but it would be stacks like something or so, if it was translatable, but it's also based on
7139 2018-12-21 10:31:40 It's the worst December for Stocks since the 1930's. Nearly all gains under Trump - wiped out! 

Feds raising rates - a sign Recession coming.

Economy collapsing like everything else around Trump.
7140 2018-12-21 10:29:13 dm ka lang kay ahgamom baka may stocks pa 
7141 2018-12-21 10:29:09 This was not because of you. This is the result of the investigation into the Las Vegas shooting which revealed that the shooter had bump stocks on several of his weapons during the shooting. Trump has been working on this ban since then and because of that. Facts are nice.
7142 2018-12-21 10:28:27 Not long left folks and stocks are running low! We only have 1 Casio CDP130 (€289), 1 CTX700 (€189) and only 4 of the SA76's.

The 12 Deals run until Monday, only a handful of pedals left too!
7143 2018-12-21 10:23:33 Which is also what the market thinks. Just looks at the banks’ stocks lately
7144 2018-12-21 10:23:33 Am hoping the stock market crashes, as crypto moons. When the stock market bear cycle is over. Invest in dividend paying stocks and ride it up for another 7-10yrs.
7145 2018-12-21 10:21:41 This is all says when they didn’t bought at the bottom, then they claim that “this was not the bottom” or “Bitcoin goes to zero” banks is doing this every week with stocks, if they loose money they readjust and say that the stock price is too high and their estimate is much lower
7146 2018-12-21 10:21:40 So it begins.... Stocks down and crypto goes up
7147 2018-12-21 10:21:38 You can be right on every factors chosing a stock, but if you're wrong about the direction of the general market, and the direction is down, 3 out of 4 stocks will plummet along with the averages, and you'll lose money big time, as many people did in 2000 and 2008. #williamjoneil
7148 2018-12-21 10:21:01 Yes v. interesting space. Recent crowdfunded initiative launched to pay for charging points across Cambridge, much like with energy, it is the infrastructure holding back growth. Who was the fund manager you heard?
7149 2018-12-21 10:20:53 We currently have rights to fish across all EU waters. If we give up that right we may instead have the right to all of the fish in our much smaller waters. But the needs to sustain and manage those fish stocks will still be there. Small fishing boats will still struggle.

7152 2018-12-21 10:20:00  The same man who said 52/48 would be "unfinished business". I bet he wishes he didn't open his mouth quite so much! BTW, the UK is richer than Norway and catches its own fish ... [within sensible and shared quotas]. But of course if we want to run down our stocks ??
7153 2018-12-21 10:19:15 Ah haba ai banda irin ku. It's end of the year and time to close all finances and stocks, therefore, you should include it in the alms. Lol 
7154 2018-12-21 10:19:12 What about Indian stocks portfolio. Why don't you come out with similar portfolio of 15 stocks for Indian markets.
7155 2018-12-21 10:17:28 Pag drop namog stocks beee huhhuhuhu @ bukodtangi :(((
7156 2018-12-21 10:15:01 Would also add that year-long stretched positioning in long USD-EM means EMFX participation in the current risk-off is soft/flattish. Meanwhile, US stocks have room to generate more pain. Separately, US fiscal brinkmanship in the same year of the TC&JA is poetic irony.

7158 2018-12-21 10:12:48 Gold and little gold stocks are as disconnected as vanadium/cobalt prices were with little asx vanadium/cobalt stocks .So this time my strategy is to buy Gold 1st and wait for the TA breakouts to buy Little gold stocks .Good idea ?
7159 2018-12-21 10:12:22 Sir IV is very low in Titan case then why you taking strangle?Strangle are more benefited in High IV stocks where IV crush will pay off. I checked you strangle the T date loses will increase if IV increased by 20% and chances of IV increase is high because of Low IV currently.
7160 2018-12-21 10:09:35 2a traitor . Reciprocity ,hearing protection act , bump stocks, ect.
7161 2018-12-21 10:09:29 It's something we need to fix.  Buy stocks while they're cheap and make a fortune when I'm elected President and we elect a Democratic Senate in 2020.  This mess is over in two years.  We're taking our MF country back.

7165 2018-12-21 10:08:44 NRA idiots already gave away bump stocks.
7166 2018-12-21 10:07:35 Yes. Spreads is the other part of equation. They are bound to rise in the 1st phase of uncertainty AKA flattening. Stocks are falling too.

7228 2018-12-21 09:28:14 It is insanity to raise interest rates when stocks are already crashing, but the Federal Reserve did it anyway.
7229 2018-12-21 09:28:00 60 percent of the stocks listed on the S&P 500 are in bear market territory, and at this point approximately four trillion dollars of stock market wealth has been wiped out.
7230 2018-12-21 09:27:30 When will people figure out that you can't have normal interest rates in an economy with an abnormally high amount of debt?  We never had a real recovery.  The Fed just inflated a bigger bubble.  That bubble may be popping.

7284 2018-12-21 08:53:36 Teria sido uma desgraça: tinham acabado com os stocks de peixe e os salários da indústria ainda seria mais miseráveis.
7285 2018-12-21 08:52:56 #Stocks are going down with the FED rate hike. This has never stopped innovation or progress. If you're buying #crypto and not looking into traditional markets, you're just shorting yourself.
7286 2018-12-21 08:52:28 I've made multiple attempts over the last month to re-enter individual stocks that have setup correctly, however have strictly managed my losses. Over 14 trades, my account loss is currently 2.6% of total equity - an easily recoverable number. #managerisk #adheretostops

7293 2018-12-21 08:49:53 Madam,  pls chk, why graphite twins r not moving. 
I m seeing,  every one wants graphite stocks but at cheaper rates. Delivery ratio remains avg 40% which is fine. 

U can guide something.
7294 2018-12-21 08:49:07 All the international graphite stocks are below 200 DMA.
7295 2018-12-21 08:49:05 Obama raised stocks slowly and steadily 12,000 points. He lowered unemployment from 10 to 4.9% but he was criticized the recovery occurred too slowly.
7296 2018-12-21 08:48:15 You did nothing to get bump stocks banned . You’re a scammer and Charlatan
7297 2018-12-21 08:47:20 Tell us few stocks names sir ji....... Will never say those words.
7298 2018-12-21 08:46:55 Best guess - not allowed to give advice - 6950! If we get BREXIT sorted there is some value in many of these stocks
7299 2018-12-21 08:46:48 Tbh killing a little too far but the culprit deserves a serious shoeing.Maybe put in stocks in terminal one foyer. One dig each when checked in.
7300 2018-12-21 08:46:40 On the other hand, it's a great day to be too poor to ever have been able to afford stocks or a 401K.

7303 2018-12-21 08:44:23 Imagine that Bakkt is the way classic financial corporations plan to enter crypto and get out of stocks before the dump (they're currently)...

...now imagine $crypto space is troll enough to pump everything to the moon before the above to happen.

would be fun.
7304 2018-12-21 08:44:18 He gave us higher deficits, tax breaks for corporations to buy back stocks, and refused to uphold his oath of office
7305 2018-12-21 08:44:05 Down, Down, Down. Where it stops, nobody knows. But we gotta be getting close to some sort of bounce imo.. #Bearish #Global #Stocks
7306 2018-12-21 08:42:32 Maybe combine it with an anime style burst guage. 3-ish stocks, DP's use one, but Burst will use them all.
7307 2018-12-21 08:42:30 In < 3 months, 14 mo. lopped off top of one of history's greatest speculative manias in stocks. So far.

Bears are fun & efficient! Beautiful in their savagery.

Most bulls are set back years though, b/c most buy near top using credit & leverage.

it's never different. Soon $TSLA

7309 2018-12-21 08:41:37 I feel for you. Stocks getting hammered, rising interest rates so bonds are risky. Where to go but cash or ride it out
7310 2018-12-21 08:41:36 me vs jin. smash bros on the switch. 1v1. 3 stocks. no items. final destination.
7311 2018-12-21 08:40:55 What you're seeing is that he's mental and has no plan at all and is flip flopping around depending on who last yelled at him the loudest

Your mental gymnastics to excuse his obvious incompetence is staggering. 
Also he caved and bump stocks are banned. Your comment?
7312 2018-12-21 08:40:48 You left out the great redistribution of American Wealth to the rest of the world, immigrants illegal or otherwise wire transfer or deliver property, stocks and money to all countries around the world, a drain approximately of 500 billion dollars per year
7313 2018-12-21 08:40:41 Just look at the pure size difference between SJP & MO. That’s the only thing stunning about MO. Those thigh-high boots must be a size 13 men’s, no wonder they’re $4,000. Nobody stocks that size, that’s special order only. Good Lord..
7314 2018-12-21 08:40:17 How long does it take to check a truck at customs just now.      And how long would it take. After March 29th       The difference in time taken will determine  how quickly food stocks are depleted/replenished
7315 2018-12-21 08:40:03 It’s not stupid
During the 10 year bull run we had a correction of 20%, from which stocks soared to many years of all time highs and yes it shouldn’t have been called a bear market. When gold dropped into bear market it stayed there till now (drop below 1530 after 1920$ per ounce
7316 2018-12-21 08:39:45 What legis? The only restriction I've seen pushed=bump stocks. POTUS hasn't demanded we repeal the 2nd A everytime we had a real or staged false flag gun event like Obama did? His answer to school shootings=arm teachers. His answer to conceal carry=apply the same to all 50 states
7317 2018-12-21 08:39:39 U.S. Markets

U.S. stocks declined as concerns grew that the U.S. government would partially shut down over the Christmas holiday season.

7324 2018-12-21 08:35:17 maybe into year end some pesion fund buying: their allocation, percentages, has to stay thesame and stocks sold so hard that in order to keep thesame %, they should sell bonds and buy stocks
7325 2018-12-21 08:34:49 CRB Index breaking  bottom channel support yday is very very big deal for me.
Now a bear market is confirmed. All ST traders in resource stocks will be forcibly converted into LT Investors over next few months .
7326 2018-12-21 08:33:21 Troy, is there any panic now? Still holding onto your stocks? Market keeps going lower with no end in sight. Any indicators pointing to a bear market?

7330 2018-12-21 08:30:56 Haha! Agreed, although I think “off with their heads” might be a bit strong. But perhaps the tower’s not a bad idea. And maybe the stocks too... in the centre of Trafalgar Square.

I am fully loaded in gold, silver, plantium stocks+a few Cu/U stocks.

7335 2018-12-21 08:28:45 Hahaha didn't that lying antiamerican  Trojan Omama horse promised single pay govt ins.  What a ruse drove  healthcare stocks down while simultaneous creating disaster bill that no one read written to give expensive plans to those that can not afford their coins raising ins cost
7336 2018-12-21 08:28:25 I can't explain it but I have an inner calmness since mid 2018 because I knew that the fat days are probably gone for good. The setups will be there once this correction ends and that won't be right now because there are none! #stocks
7337 2018-12-21 08:27:40 Theresa May is a thug. She has caused *immense* damage to our reputation on world stage, she has trashed our UK stocks + our politics, been in contempt of our Parliament + forced her ugly hostile violence-inducing policies by the back-door. Revoke A50. End this ugly nightmare.

7340 2018-12-21 08:25:08 no you should invest in stocks and bonds for the future 
7341 2018-12-21 08:23:26 No last day of school games at @edinburghpaper today. One of the busiest days of year as we try to squirrel away some stories for next week and get them on the stocks..as well as our normal output. Still, beats working for a living.

1. Withdraws 2000 troops out of Syria
2. Withdraws 7000 troops out of Afghanistan

4. Takes a small step towards criminal justice

He has done terrible things as usual (gutted ACA) but I'll take a win 4 the people when I get one

7347 2018-12-21 08:22:05 Stocks and the markets are an absolute joke at the moment!

7348 2018-12-21 08:21:34 it is a good company but as all the infra stocks are not doing well this is also trading lower side.  you can hold the stock you will get your price and also decent returns over longer term.

7351 2018-12-21 08:19:37 When the bottom half starts getting raises starts having a good life. Sell stocks. They don’t save. Velocity of money is high.

It makes me sad it is so. It is true. Poor will remain poor disparities will grow. That is the incentive structure.

7369 2018-12-21 08:08:44 Can’t completely blame dt, every country in the world seems to manipulate currency creating a worldwide bubble in stocks.  But he sure is the trigger lately and never deserved the credit he gave himself for worldwide and U.S. gains.  But i could be wrong...

Otters have now decimated fish stocks, specimen pike are now non existent in Fen drains......MLC = GORMLESS...LEAVE NATURE ALONE. The EA ain’t got a clue what to do about otter problem
7372 2018-12-21 08:03:45 Stocks aren’t getting cheaper. The market is recalibrating for a slowing economy with lower earnings. If earnings are going to be lower than current estimates stocks then you’ve got lower prices with the same ratio

7397 2018-12-21 07:39:34 You didn't do anything. ATF had floated that idea well before Las Vegas. Vegas was the catalyst. This ban was nothing more than keeping bump-stocks from becoming more efficient. In the end, Trump did this. He banned a novelty item. You tweeted w/o misspelling a 4 letter word.
7398 2018-12-21 07:39:20  it won't shake markets, unless maybe the stocks of some weapons manufacturers that are going to be taking a serious beating because their business model paradigm (endless wars) is about to come to a screeching halt.
7399 2018-12-21 07:38:29 It's simple. Buy stocks in the company....
7400 2018-12-21 07:38:13 Just wait. One day a big State that actually matters economically to the country will go dark, and then watch the herd spin on its heels and gore the green cheer squad.

Get your popcorn stocks in now. It won't be pretty, but it sure will turn this BS around quick smart.
7401 2018-12-21 07:37:11 MAY STOCKS PA BA :(((((
7402 2018-12-21 07:37:08 2019 FEAR OF GOD STOCKS WILL GO UP
7403 2018-12-21 07:36:40 I don't see weakness yet on charts. This is normal pullback of upside move. Earnings are pretty normal and already many stocks have fallen from their high to lows when other markets where making LTH's. The probability of both side move is high. So better switching to cash is best
7404 2018-12-21 07:33:43 MY CALLS UJJIVAN, HSIL;, TAKE STOCKS OF THE DAYYYYYYYYYYYY
7405 2018-12-21 07:31:07 The Dow dropped 474 pts bringing losses to more than 1700. Before stocks started plummeting, Trump used to boast about them every 35 hours.

This is the worst December on Wall Street since 1931 during the depths of the Great Depression.

7407 2018-12-21 07:30:54 Bien comme ça les commerçants ne pourront pas s’approvisionner, donc ils auront moins de stocks, donc moins de CA donc moins de rentrée d’argent pour payer les salaires donc un risque de dépôt de bilan.

7412 2018-12-21 07:26:26 This is a crash. Might not be a major crash, but its a crash no less. These are mega cap stocks losing 40% of their value in weeks.
7413 2018-12-21 07:23:20 TRUMP throws White House and Washington in chaos. Stocks are tanking, Mattis has quit in protest, shutdown about to happen, ALL BECAUSE OF A DOUCHE BAG WHO IS THE WORST OCCUPANT OF THE OVAL OFFICE EVER.
7414 2018-12-21 07:21:47 Up to 50% Off Selected Styles. Hurry, While Stocks Last. Limited Time Only!
7415 2018-12-21 07:21:41 NRA not only gave Trump 30 million they also gave dems virtually nothing unlike 1992 when more bipartisan with political contributions 60%R 40%D. Trump publicly hinted bump stocks banned & universal background checks but reversed after meeting privately with NRA. RU now a factor?

7419 2018-12-21 07:17:25 Maybe Main Street won’t care that much because only <20% of the Main Street own stocks.
7420 2018-12-21 07:16:20 big stock exchanges are Down 25% crypto down 90% if 1% of the stocks move to crypto will instantly be 1trillion market cap. 2% moon 3% forget the lambos everyone will have choppers. fuck the bank song bitcoin and crypto. timing is everything $kmd $btc $eth #crypto

7434 2018-12-21 07:06:32 The only reason stocks are plummeting is because Trump is ending wars left and right. Wall Street is scared because they know the times of profiting of perpetual never ending war are over. #SyriaWithdrawal

7436 2018-12-21 07:04:32 The wisdom of crowds in markets like stocks is a classic and complete fallacy. Humans herd - and even more so when advisers advise trusting the herd. Evidence covered in my book. Extract to follow when I get time.

7439 2018-12-21 07:01:39 Let’s watch the Gun Crime Rate with Bump Stocks go down. Oh wait, nothing will change.
7440 2018-12-21 07:00:46 What’s your time horizon ? The fact that real estate and stocks are seemingly joined together with similar trends is a concern.
7441 2018-12-21 07:00:45 Trump got bump stocks banned actually you had zero to do with it
7442 2018-12-21 06:59:53 Crypto is very close to the bottom, stocks are close to the top. Smart people should know what to do. We will see if your right after the holidays.
7443 2018-12-21 06:59:31 Continued,  surplus meat if any kind. Trapped, fished and green and wild berries ect. I own weapons,  do back ground checks and certify.

7445 2018-12-21 06:58:38 Is this total job losses or just those due to E.U. fisheries policy ?  (for example depleted fish stocks, loss of Icelandic fishing grounds, shift towards eating meat as it became cheaper, etc)
7446 2018-12-21 06:58:36 It is indeed becoming a scary place...and stocks keep evaporating every time asshole opens his mouth
7447 2018-12-21 06:57:25 cocks instead of stocks
7448 2018-12-21 06:57:19 Not sure that's what's happening... This safe haven more likely to get halved then their stocks at current market conditions.
7449 2018-12-21 06:54:51 Hey Jt, which website do you use to check that  stocks?
7450 2018-12-21 06:54:35 You did nothing. Absolutely nothing to get bump stocks banned.
As typical, you take credit when there is no credit due.

7475 2018-12-21 06:41:23 In the end they will do anything in their power to keep rates low and stocks/bonds up - - look at #Japan and the #ECB
7476 2018-12-21 06:41:12 So...
1) We're pulling out of Syria and Afghanistan, surrendering to Isis and the Taliban.
2) We're ready to shut down the government over an unnecessary wall
3) The final grownup in the West Wing, General Mattis, resigned
4) Stocks are in free fall
And...all is okay, right?
7477 2018-12-21 06:40:14 They will force pensions and funds to buy at some point and/or buy most of the issuance (and start buying stocks) at some point. That will kill the dollar but its a year or so away maybe? I'd guess they will choose to save #Treasurys and stocks over the #USD

7495 2018-12-21 06:26:54 Trump says housing is hot, interest rates are low, stocks are trending upwards and the global economy has nothing to do with America First. And Trump's base can be watching the stock ticker plunge while nodding agreement with everything he says. Facts, for Trump, are optional.

7500 2018-12-21 06:26:02 Yeah he has said he makes more when stocks are low so he can buy them up
7501 2018-12-21 06:25:54 I like that bump stocks were banned.

I like the criminal justice reform bill. 

He fired Comey, which led to the appointment of Robert Mueller.
7502 2018-12-21 06:24:59 Really, what are they going to do? Ban bump stocks or something... Oh wait a minute.
7503 2018-12-21 06:23:59 Paper stocks are in consolidation mode after rising from Q2, currently accumulation mode, can move before Q3 and best by Q4.  Afterall sector is running at 80% plus capacity and some like u reading are out of old capacity as well
7504 2018-12-21 06:23:42 First 50k in 18 years will pay for a semester of college but if you don't worry about stocks being called away on rips above strike (opportunity missed) sounds good.

7507 2018-12-21 06:22:12 And bump stocks aren’t protected. Banning all rifles or hand guns would and should be considered an attack on the 2A, but no one is doing that.
7508 2018-12-21 06:21:23 The sweet sounds of a business genius would not negatively impact the market. The unhinged, psychotic ravings of a malign, impulsive, treasonous narcissist who has access to the nuclear codes and the most heavily armed military in history might nudge stocks a tad lower, though.
7509 2018-12-21 06:19:58 Morning all and happy Friday!

7510 2018-12-21 06:19:39 Absolutely reamed.
It may be small and only in it's infant stage, but I still dislike an 8% loss in two days and nearly 10% for the week.

7513 2018-12-21 06:16:58 Paper stocks are in consolidation mode i think as of now, before Q3 and Q4 they can move fast, time to add and look out for those staying in cash. Holding some cos. @iManasArora
7514 2018-12-21 06:16:31 Trump’s ban on bump stocks is a little different. Owners have 90 days to *destroy* their bump stocks or turn them in to the ATF.
7515 2018-12-21 06:15:11 I'll be going back to America next week to refill my stocks.
7516 2018-12-21 06:14:23 I know you're desperate to be relevant, but you had nothing to do with banning bump stocks. 

Sit down and grow up.
7517 2018-12-21 06:12:19 I dreamt that I purchased @RailService and #BritishRail thus pushed a total renaming and repainting of the rolling stocks and companies to Woods System ED, and also changed the registration of all trains to CH-WS... was kind of a good dream though...

1. The US stocks and indices that Trump uses as gauge for his government has entirely turned red - negative in returns.

2. Vladimir Putin has clearly stated the world shouldn’t underestimate the risk of a Nuclear War.

7523 2018-12-21 06:08:18 If $1T total market cap seems far off. Just remember each day crypto moves up & down by the billion, global stocks move up & down in the trillion. We are just a drop in the ocean of the global liquidity pool. The story is starting, not ending.
7524 2018-12-21 06:08:06 Remember a year ago, when all the republicans were clapping for their “dear leader” after they passed the tax cut scam? Big smiles? 

How’s that working out for us?

Stocks gonna soar, and raises are gonna flow, right?

How’s that working out?

Are we great again, ‘yet’?

7528 2018-12-21 06:06:24 If you view Donald Trump as a chaos agent of Vladimir Putin, instead of as mundanely corrupt & incompetent, things make a lot of sense: The more insanity & instability he creates, the more Putin benefits from it.

Today is a perfect example:

Mattis
Stocks
Whitaker
Govt shutdown
7529 2018-12-21 06:05:43 And when the stock market crashed, there was no physical money to give to stock brokers that were selling stocks. Treasury printed more but the more they print, the lesser the value of a dollar. Another example is  collectors. Stuff is only valuable when theres low supply of it.

7588 2018-12-21 05:32:24 This is a very bad move.  Failing on Obamacare, no border wall, banning bump stocks.  You are heading in the wrong direction, Sir.  Russia and Iran are cheering this move.

7590 2018-12-21 05:30:28 No, I am not enjoying the show. Trump banned bump stocks and people have to turn them in without compensation. Trump wants every state to have red flag laws. He said, take the guns and have due process second.

7595 2018-12-21 05:28:00 What’s annoying is that all of this market movement is based on speculation. Companies financials are still strong and we aren’t seeing defaults. The big guys are going to be buying up all of the best stocks and will make a KILLING when it rebounds.

Clinton was RIGHT he's DANGEROUS for U.S.-Pass the clean Senate bill & override veto!
7650 2018-12-21 05:01:58 What about @PGE4Me They’ve killed more Californians this year than bump stocks.  And you’re allowing them to charge us more to pay their  fines .  Lock their leadership up.
7651 2018-12-21 05:01:57 He’s definitely going to get an earful. Lol his excuse will be discounted stocks for Christmas.
7652 2018-12-21 05:00:33 I think you’re missing the pt @ folks buying these things *legally,* not as “criminals.” Further, it solves the problem of ppl turning legal semi-automatic rifles into illegal automatics. You can no longer buy a legal item (bump stocks) and create illegal ones. That’s > feelings.
7653 2018-12-21 05:00:33 4th/91 losing to marss and laid.

Went Inkling on them and at least took them to last stock with her. 

Spamming roller cost me some stocks, might be a little overrated LOL

7655 2018-12-21 04:59:48 Just over valued stocks !! Wall Street is cashing in on investors over valued stocks !!
7656 2018-12-21 04:59:46 Stocks went up too much for too long. Had to come down hard at some point. Rest are all just triggers IMO. You can't inflate a balloon beyond a point 
7657 2018-12-21 04:59:01 I will go with the idiot part and "NO" he should not get bump stocks banned. No, I do not use them or do I see a need but that is not the point. Point is there was much more to the Las Vegas shooting than was released and a bump stock sure did not rent the room.
7658 2018-12-21 04:58:50 Nike stocks are rising, I was worried with the way these boosters set up!!

7664 2018-12-21 04:57:05 PP World consists of 75% stocks, 25% gold. Crypto belongs to asset class of currencies I think, not really a new asset class but certainly revolutionizing it.
7665 2018-12-21 04:57:00 I also believe that some of the corporations are selling off their stocks to get back some of their money. It was a bait and switch market this year.
7666 2018-12-21 04:56:12 So true. Fundraising is significantly down for the end of the year and I'm hella worried. Our assets are mostly in stocks. So it's doubly scary.
7667 2018-12-21 04:56:05 The signs are there
Tomorrow could see stocks crash and burn
7668 2018-12-21 04:55:43 Very sad indeed.  Between this, bump stocks, and potential ly caving on his shut down threat, this has been a very tough week.
7669 2018-12-21 04:54:45 Infosys Ltd appointed Nilanjan Roy as chief financial officer, effective Mar 1. Prior to joining the company, Roy was global chief financial officer of

7671 2018-12-21 04:54:27 Not good at picking stocks but seems like a better dude than that other blowhard "Downtown"....he is insufferable.   Im sure they are all paid to pump and unless you get lucky and front run their shit then shame on you for buying on their advice..
7672 2018-12-21 04:54:24 Trump style has been one of mindless extremes, one after the other, trying to force his will on his adversaries. So far, no victories yet from that style. Corp tax cut led to buybacks. Retaliatory tariffs shaking economies, overheated US raised rates. Stocks -10% this year.
7673 2018-12-21 04:54:00 My stocks been dropping since September down almost half of what I invested
7674 2018-12-21 04:52:34 OIL AND GAS:

7687 2018-12-21 04:48:17 In a heartbeat. Tear them off the pedestal and put them in stocks.

7696 2018-12-21 04:43:46 I’m still up. Neurons are firing like AR-15’s with bump stocks. And with about as much accuracy. I have been sleeping at a slow, yet increasingly later time. Oh. Wait. Eddie Palmieri. I will sleep after Eddie. 

I have a plan. 

The man without a plan is not a man. (Piffle)

7699 2018-12-21 04:41:06 12% short interest, mainly from hedge funds that own "cheap" stocks and short the best run American blue chips like $HRL are getting run over so redemptions will likely force more short covering as well. How many packaged foods companies can consistently grow EPS 10%/year?
7700 2018-12-21 04:40:26 Video game companies stocks are down (not because lack of sales) but due to a slump in the overall economy, I am looking into using my knowledge of video games to buy stocks of companies I know will bounce back in the next 5-8 years. Hint: look at the Engine company...
7701 2018-12-21 04:40:22 Jim: your enlightened commentary and horse sense is always welcome. The average American may not own individual stocks, but their 401k is most likely in mutual funds or their own company’s stock.

7705 2018-12-21 04:38:56 The way the #ShareMarket news come, they never forget to provide the reason behind fall or rise of the stocks. Looks like they know everything, why can't they serve as the saviour for all.
7706 2018-12-21 04:38:55 Buy stocks in canopy growth Corp now!!!!!! If you thought amazon stock is big then you better get it on this immediately!
7707 2018-12-21 04:38:50 David, bump stocks can be made by any ten year old kid in his garage. Worse yet, go on youtube and you'll see that ANY semi-auto firearm can be fired in auto mode simply by holding your trigger finger a certain way. Banning bump stocks literally does nothing.
7708 2018-12-21 04:38:23 Bad timing , in the end. We have a crash danger but also a high chance of a rebound. To figure out which one - my cats are working on it . In any case i will curtail their index activity . I will chase my cats back to individual stocks
7709 2018-12-21 04:38:21 #RepScottPerry, Federal contractors do not get paid during a shut down.  Most make minimum wage. They are your janitors, cooks, land keepers, secretary.  It is Christmas.  Unlike you, they do not have savings, stocks, etc. to live on.
7710 2018-12-21 04:36:59 Warmonger. 

Which stocks do you own?...
7711 2018-12-21 04:36:36 Also why are we getting blamed why shops id everyone? Half of the juul sales witch you have stocks in are to blame not flavors not the device companies but the company you yourself bought stocks in? Quit blaming the flavors and the industry and realize it's from shitty parents
7712 2018-12-21 04:36:36 Just because you put your money in a basket of stocks that doesn't mean your safe from the market swings. Start investing in small companies do real research and only then invest. Invest with patience and clarity.#stocks #Stock #money #clarity
7713 2018-12-21 04:36:28 Twitter, Facebook, and Google have become the new “sin” stocks.
7714 2018-12-21 04:36:17 One thing really amazes me that so many years ago when there was no computers, softwares, few stocks to trade, etc. but still he could cracked it perfectly. I think we all are spoiled and lost in too much of noice. Who learns to ignore all this noice makes it to the top.
7715 2018-12-21 04:34:15 The answer to why stocks are tanking is "democrats". 

The last time Pelosi and the dems took the House the same exact thing happened, the media deemed it "the Bush recession". Go look at the NYSE the week after the 2006 elections.

Elections have consequences.
