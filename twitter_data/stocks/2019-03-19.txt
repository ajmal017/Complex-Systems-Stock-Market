7 2019-03-19 23:55:21 How does that harm YOU? SM just want our money. Not every fan has access to merch/albums. Sharing content is a godsend to them. SM can go ahead and sue. Watch their stocks tumble and the gp turn against EXO if they do. Many become fans after watching these uploads.
8 2019-03-19 23:55:01 So much for that meaningless statement. By the end of the day, the broad based indices finished down. So much for your so called "stocks surge in celebration of low inflation." Normal inflation rates increase earnings & revenue, perhaps a CPI increase of +0.20% should be a party.
9 2019-03-19 23:53:59 From Irrational Exuberance: "A strong signal to replace stocks with bonds would be a time with high CAPE and high long-term real interest rates. Such a time was September 1929 when the CAPE was 32.6, when the long-term interest rate was 3.4%.." current CAPE=30 10yr=2.5% $SPY $QQQ
10 2019-03-19 23:53:28 You’re buying this because it seems logical.  But if u look up CEOs salaries they’re making millions separate from stocks. These $1 salaries are outliers. Their stocks should be taxed at higher rates though no doubt. He has a small point but he’s misleading.

13 2019-03-19 23:51:01 I have improved my trading with one simple question. Is this a HARD trade? $TSLA is s good example of a hard as hell trade. Avoid biggest battle grounds. Pick easier stocks.

16 2019-03-19 23:50:08 Comparing most stocks to SOM would make them look inferior to be fair. SOM's numbers look amazing.

Why do you think they're becoming less cyclical? Surely they're still vulnerable to a USA construction crash. Not that i'm suggesting one is about to happen.
