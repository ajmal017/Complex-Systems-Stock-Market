Do you trade stocks on the Mexican exchange?
3 2018-08-02 23:54:23 I consider anyone making more than $200k rich and most cuts to corporate taxes have gone to buy g back stocks. Most employees didn't see any of that trickle down.

10 2018-08-02 23:47:45 The keto diet is only good for short term weight loss. Not eating carbs makes your body think ur starving which causes your body to start using fat reserves as energy. Once you introduce carbs back, your body stocks up and you gain a lot of weight back. ketosis can kill you also

39 2018-08-02 23:40:53 Catalysts for pullback/consolidation could be negative earnings for some index stocks. 
 
U.S. China Route, Ghost-month, rate hike (knee jerk or faster pace) etc.Should a pullback occur, it would be positive if the index creates a higher low above  6923.27, 7143, 7327 pivots

67 2018-08-02 23:17:23 48% of Americans own stocks according to the articles I read. So unless that data was wrong your figure might be only 401k eg excludes IRA's and SEP's etc

My question to the 52% who dont own stocks for retirement...who do you think is going to take care of you? @spangler_steven?

70 2018-08-02 23:13:07 Level2 is only useful for penny stocks, trying to use it on the big boards isn’t really going to help you much, the price & order flow moves way too fast to identify when the trend is going to reverse & isn’t as reliable because there’s always constant volume coming in.

89 2018-08-02 22:58:51 I agree with many of the messages you send out through Twitter.

A difficult question to answer, I believe.
90 2018-08-02 22:58:04 Word. Just to clarify, I am using ”sin stocks” to cover the broader spectrum. More about that “defensive” argument made for non ESG. But we on the same page here.

93 2018-08-02 22:55:26 IDK. I suspect they’re less cyclical than others. But ESG covers more than sin stocks. Screening out sin stocks is what used to happen in SEI but ESG includes other factors (and, depending on the definition) can actually include sin stocks.

101 2018-08-02 22:51:03 Of this, wheat accounted for 5.7 MMT vs 0.0 MMT last June. It implies  that Russia's grain carryover stocks held on big&medium farms and  silos will be at 12.6 MMT vs 14.7 MMT last year while wheat - 8.2 MMT  and 9.4 MMT respectively.

108 2018-08-02 22:45:17 You forget that smart people who avoided $MNKD altogether (perhaps deploying that money in other more successful stocks) made money.
109 2018-08-02 22:44:55 I thought minimum on IB was 10k, or maybe that’s for margin? Nonetheless it’s nice to see that you are expressing your trades with options instead of low priced stocks

111 2018-08-02 22:44:20 Fair point, unfortunately that money you were upset about going to poor people instead goes to ultra wealthy that use it to buy back stocks to make themselves richer. You aren’t saving anything. Redistribution of resources upwards... but I’m sure it’ll “trickle” down to you....

114 2018-08-02 22:40:31 First, I did retire early, and it takes time and a plan. I was helped several others I worked with to retire early. Only one dabbled in stocks using an advisor that was fair. All retired in 30 years, and it was growth and dividend with higher risk by age. Real Estate was second.

116 2018-08-02 22:39:20 To me, Russia's grain carryover stocks are below 2017/18. Rosstat estimated Russia's grain availabilty as of 01/07 at 20.6 MMT vs 15.3 MMT last year. The numbers include the grain of new crop gathered in June. This year, June output was some 8 MMT vs just 0.6 MMT last June .cntd
117 2018-08-02 22:39:17 Apple stocks climbed $17 USD in the past two days.

123 2018-08-02 22:34:20 I assure you I am very weak to peer pressure, and someone advised me to buy 400 stocks in olive garden. It was a rush at first, but there were consequences.
124 2018-08-02 22:32:56 Great investing convo with @MDproductions5 earlier today... @jimcramer just said he's still bullish on @dunkindonuts #stocks #NYSE

126 2018-08-02 22:32:04 Do NOT invest your retirement money in these. I’d rather go ‘penny stocks’.

129 2018-08-02 22:29:46 OMG yes. You CANT trade options unless you at least understand the basics of stocks. This isn’t Buy and forget, to anyone thinking that! You need people like Glenn that study this to really make above average returns. This is NOT free money. It has risk!
130 2018-08-02 22:29:40 Of what stocks?

132 2018-08-02 22:28:11 This account started at $35,000 10 months ago. I take losses. Options traders do and if they say they don’t they’re liars. You must watch the market, analyze numbers, and buy put spreads against longs when the stocks get overbought. Simple protection

134 2018-08-02 22:27:15 I would guess the plan would've been to *try* to manipulate him somehow, but something convinced them that he wasn't easy to sway as a normal politician is (money, stocks, business ops, etc.) Trump is truly loosing a lot by being President right now, unlike the previous guy.
135 2018-08-02 22:26:55 You get half my stocks already with that bs move i hate u

149 2018-08-02 22:20:46 As you might be able to tell, I'm changing my M.O. on MJ stocks. I used to game anticipatable catalysts, around which scams would run ridiculous amounts. At this point, I'm not really comfortable putting any more than ~1% of my account into any one scammy MJ.
150 2018-08-02 22:20:46 A day or 2 in the stocks with people allowed to throw turf at you. #turfthief
151 2018-08-02 22:20:41 Tech stocks pushed the S&P500 & Nasdaq higher o/n, driven by Apple as the iPhone maker became the first publicly traded US company worth a trillion dollars. Ahead of the local open SPI futures are 21 points higher at 6,213.
152 2018-08-02 22:20:18 The stock market is DOWN since the big tax cuts.  The only reason it went up 25% shortly after the election is because the Street was anticipating a 40% tax cuts for corporations.  Theres a reason stocks havent budged since January.
153 2018-08-02 22:20:11 The stock market is the most wasteful invention of mankind. You can’t have stocks + institutional risk & monetized debt at the same time, of course the wealthy will store their wealth in a company like AAPL while everyone else (labor) goes into debt. Invest in literally anything
154 2018-08-02 22:19:56 Age is a key determinant of risk!! If you’re young, you can absorb a loss; you have time for home runs to overtake losses. But as you depend on the income risk is too much for growth stocks. But not options! You can write them against your stocks &  add to your retirement income.
155 2018-08-02 22:19:07 I bought some stocks today for the first time ever. I decided to make a very small investment in weed and water. Both stocks lost $0.05 today. Lets try again tomorrow
156 2018-08-02 22:18:36 Uh. No. They are due to the tax break for the one % and the non existent trickle down theory! Trump and gave tax breaks during record corporate profits! Greedy CEOS invested the money back into Co. stocks, instead of workers wages! Get ready for a recession it happens every time!
157 2018-08-02 22:17:37 It blows my mind that I’ve got what I consider a limited portfolio (4 pot stocks) and you’ve got a really diverse portfolio, roughly the same base amt, yet our daily gains and losses are always quite close. You outgained me by $183 today. Hope we both break $1M on the same day!!
158 2018-08-02 22:16:13 @VitalVegas with all the news of stocks diving&such, what do you think all the strip casinos(@MGMGrand @CaesarsPalace @WynnLasVegas) will do? Remove/reduce fees, reduce room rates, offer better promos/comps? Combination therein? Something(s) completely different or new?

165 2018-08-02 22:13:04 Chinesse opaque overpriced stocks in a Marxist regime are not comparable oin ANY way to the most watched, analysed, hyped and trashed stocks in history.
166 2018-08-02 22:12:47 I tend to agree. Perhaps the “defensive nature” of sin stocks is also a myth.
167 2018-08-02 22:12:26 should go back to the people, not private coporations to buy back stocks. We believe EVERY man woman and child should be able to see a doctor and not go bankrupt. We are Christians.

171 2018-08-02 22:10:22 Welcome to the family, you will never look back! Fun Tesla facts for the week, Tesla sells (delivers) more Model 3s than all other cars in its class combined, and TSLA stock just went up over 19% causing over a billion dollars loss for people that were shorting the stocks \o/

173 2018-08-02 22:10:16 Fantastic day of underwriting, credit analysis, due diligence & most importantly placing great and complex real estate deals together. I've told you before and will reiterate it again - parking funds in RE will yield better returns at the min 5% all the way to 30%+>stocks @ RFV!!
174 2018-08-02 22:08:06 Educate yourself first and start looking at the patterns of different stocks. Keeping up on news, watching Bloomberg, etc. is a MAJOR part of it.

I started out using an app called Stash, and they gave you the tools to learn, it’s up to you to take advantage of it.
175 2018-08-02 22:08:05 @cvpayne Would you consider buying GE stock as a long term investment?  I'm thinking about getting back into stocks and wondering cheap ones to start with.
176 2018-08-02 22:06:37 After staring at those 5 stocks for a few minutes trying make an acronym as cool as FAANG, I give up.
177 2018-08-02 22:05:49 I'm taking profits on stocks and balancing them with my dad's loses to stave off taxes.

A very big market correction is coming, 1/3 to 1/2 of 2008.
178 2018-08-02 22:05:48 Why would stocks falling mean interest rate rises, they have no correlation in UK in fact in the US it would be the opposite because of the amount of investment in the stock market by the population and therefore does have real economy impact. In the UK it has basically no impact

185 2018-08-02 21:54:34 I agree on milestone. I do not think they will remain the leaders with iPhone sales slipping. Also I think the tech stocks are going to have a correction?

188 2018-08-02 21:51:20 You should argue with him because he is an angry aapl shortseller who has been wrong for 107 points. Stocks are valued on earnings growth rate and cash flow. All companies use certain amounts of debt and equity financing. The amount of aapl debt in and of itself is inconsequentia
189 2018-08-02 21:51:09 The bloke needs to give his head a wobble
190 2018-08-02 21:50:43 @labdrive2 First tell us how much money you got in tax breaks and how much of your stocks you bought back VS what portion of it you have put into salary rises and hiring (I mean workers rise, not white collar rises). We'll see then how serious you are about US workers.

228 2018-08-02 21:28:49 Bound to rise yes. However issue is companies are bracing themselves for a recession. 

The EXPONENTIAL increase in profits the last 4 years PLUS a MASSIVE tax cut for companies... should have translated to far larger pay raises. 

However, they have been padding their stocks

235 2018-08-02 21:26:37 Where them stocks at playa? 
236 2018-08-02 21:25:38 Real QE never ends. In spite the FED increases rates by 1% max a year, government increases debt and print new money by 5% a year. Roughly real annual QE = 4%. Stocks fail to fall under such conditions even under pressure of trade war against all the world.

238 2018-08-02 21:23:46 My mortgage backed stocks are taking a beating since Trump Fed raised interest rates. We are going to have another housing crisis.  Cars will cost more.  GOP always breaks the economy for the rest of us.  They hoard their cash & profit off the recovery. Buy low, sell high.
239 2018-08-02 21:23:12 HP Envy Computer and Windows 10:  Now I understand why they called it Envy since that's what you'll feel toward anyone without one. Windows 10, why Apple stocks just reached a value of a trillion $.

243 2018-08-02 21:21:12 Yes, but you obviously can't maintain the same profit margins meaning lower dividends unless prices rise. Probably could assume stocks would fall, intetest rates rise further, property values fall and investments moved into cash.
244 2018-08-02 21:20:42 WOW!!!!!!   not
245 2018-08-02 21:20:36 Stocks way overvalued. Here comes 1929 all over again

251 2018-08-02 21:16:12 They were separate questions. I would buy after Moonves is gone. I don’t buy tobacco and gun manufacturers’ stocks.
252 2018-08-02 21:16:05 What reputations....as wet, weak and wobbly quislings hmmm and universal laughing stocks, some reputation to lose that!!!
253 2018-08-02 21:15:21 Yeah, i do that all the time. It's one of my Etf strategies. You can usually see the quarter first, get some pullback in the heavily weighted stocks.. then buy the sector. Because all the lemmings jump into it, like it's a new toy. ST trading, LT sometimes it has legs.
254 2018-08-02 21:14:59 Was there any possibility to short it during that time frame? Not familiar with standard stocks...
255 2018-08-02 21:13:46 2018. Year of tech stocks
256 2018-08-02 21:13:20 Once those factories are done I'd be a lot more confident, but by that point the stocks will have made their changes. I'd say that the stock reflects current market trust of a company, as those factories are released my and the market's trust will definitely increase accordingly
257 2018-08-02 21:12:41 According to that fount of all knowledge QI - those are in fact pillories - stocks were for legs

367 2018-08-02 20:29:27 Start with Trading In The Zone by Mark Douglas. Then get Technical Analysis for Dummies. Before trading with real money, go back to Mark Douglas.

375 2018-08-02 20:26:10 I have a caveat to this. Only quality stocks be it large mid or small will do well. 

Large caps have deep pockets to sustain.

Midcaps and small caps will be trampled. Only those with an exceptional business model that thrives despite disruption will scale up and grow

408 2018-08-02 20:08:11 Seriously. That was nuts. Stocks went to places I couldnt believe.
409 2018-08-02 20:07:40 That happened to me 2 mos. ago. My guess is that stop didn't trigger because it was a "limit stop" vs. a "market stop."  Limits can be missed when stocks sell off quickly.

480 2018-08-02 19:32:35 #Apple hits 1 trillion dollars. Nice, but there is no doubt they were MUCH better as an underdog when they had to be the best at what they do. Now they are very much in "fuck it" mode - riding waves of cash and thinking the Stocks app is worthy of an overhaul.
481 2018-08-02 19:32:21 @nastynate1 to some, that might mean waking up every day & trading 10 stocks they've never even heard of before that day, based on price/vol
482 2018-08-02 19:32:16 In short: market sentiment is what makes stocks prices fluctuate, but quarterly/yearly results is what helps keep it stable

507 2018-08-02 19:22:05 I have a rule not buying stocks with a volume less than 100K per day. I see people constantly adding but it will be quite difficult to unload 3K+ shares in a stock like TRIL when it only trades an avg of 40K a day.

551 2018-08-02 19:00:42 Damn. That is some fantastic derp. The Great Depression was caused by millions of people investing on speculation and using loans to buy over-valued stocks. That's kind of what happens when you don't have regulations on financial institutions.

621 2018-08-02 18:27:57 Company Fundamentals: The market's biggest winners tend to be companies that have innovative, industry-leading products that are driving exceptional earnings and sales growth. So be sure to focus on stocks that fit that bill.
622 2018-08-02 18:27:53 GBP/USD-Offered into the BoE - USD led, as stocks slip
• -0.1% - USD led, at the base of a 1.3107/28 range, quiet early, then busy
• EUR/GBP +0.1% - trades at the top of a 0.8884/0.8892 range - consistent flow
623 2018-08-02 18:27:42 Market Direction: The best time to buy stocks is when the general market is in a confirmed uptrend. When the market outlook is "uptrend under pressure" or "market in correction," it's best to keep your powder dry and wait for a new rally to take hold.
624 2018-08-02 18:27:25 When looking for the best stocks to buy and the best time to buy them, three main factors come into play. You'll significantly increase your rewards and reduce your risk if you wait for each of these elements to line up before you buy.

634 2018-08-02 18:20:52 A deepening trade dispute between the United States and China  weighed on global stocks and bond yields on Thursday, prompting  investors to shed risky assets in favor of safer ones amid uncertainty  over future tariffs.
635 2018-08-02 18:20:41 Yes, Aimpoint CS for B and C versions. ”Kikarsikte 09/Hensoldt” for for some B’s, eventually some C’s and for all D’s. It is odd that Sweden suddenly have so many variants of an older service rifle. Regular stocks are still used, as well as regular HK collapsible stock.
636 2018-08-02 18:20:09 I am seeing many broken stocks attempting to resurrect themselves with strong earning reactions.  You want to keep a close eye on these to see if they can form a constructive base,  Gap ups are an elixir as they can speed up the healing process for many damaged charts.

646 2018-08-02 18:12:47 Only about a 3rd of Americans have a 401k. It’s the same as when the stock market is incorrectly used as a proxy for the economy (less than half of Americans have stocks).

649 2018-08-02 18:12:02 So be one of the 50% of Americans who hold stocks in their 401k that ARE benefitting from buybacks.

Like i said yesterday if you had only $25k in Vanguard POGRX in 2008.....today that's worth $88k

657 2018-08-02 18:09:38 Bought some apple stocks today, wish I bought it two days ago when it was under $200 
658 2018-08-02 18:08:48 Pm me 4 orders stocks now on hand...paunahan uli po...
659 2018-08-02 18:08:25 True.  I wish there was another HIBB right now.  Not much out there of value except declining businesses, and cyclical energy stocks.  Nothing that I can buy and forget about.  Have to watch them closely in case the cycle turns.

It's hard work these days.
660 2018-08-02 18:08:10 All crypto is speculative as well as stocks obviously $ETC is 10,000x more speculative than $ETH since there is no legitimate reason for it to exist other than for @DCGco to pump and dump it on morons that's its only use case.
661 2018-08-02 18:07:58 Same here bro, exchanging views is healthy as you learn new things from different perspectives 
662 2018-08-02 18:07:19 Looks like your gonna repossess someones house, or short sell some stocks...
663 2018-08-02 18:07:13 And here I thought the worst thing you could do is have this stunning amazing list of stocks to trade, and then operate a live account to benefit from that hard work. 

Think of all the millions he’s missed out on by not trading his own research 
664 2018-08-02 18:07:12 $WRGL 0.0009 watching this one could have $GRPS move with volume imo
665 2018-08-02 18:06:52 It's almost time for Mid Day Movers w/Lichtenstein at 130pm ct on @TDANetwork - Today Don Kaufman @TheoTrade talking casino stocks #FOMC #BOJ #BOFE - Hope you're ready to brrrring it Don, cause I'm fired up about it! - Tune in!
666 2018-08-02 18:06:14 And then with the profits sure to ensue from all three stocks, maybe I can buy a #Model3...
667 2018-08-02 18:06:13 Chinese stocks burned me. Ten Cent is the only one I will trust once tariff talks die down. Rebound stocks to buy and hold include TWTR, OLED and SHOP. 

Trend stocks are, in video games, cannibus, e-commerce, fresh Mexican food, streaming & fintech.

671 2018-08-02 18:05:02 APPLE became the first $1 trillion publicly listed U.S. company on Thursday,  leading a rebound in technology stocks and pushing the benchmark S&P  500 and the Nasdaq higher

674 2018-08-02 18:03:37 Very interesting. Was raised by a single mom and even lived in a car briefly when I was around 12/13. I was very unprepared for the world of business stocks and bond etc. Also when you operate from a debt position you need to take on more risk to increase ROI to catch up
675 2018-08-02 18:02:31 Picked up some #SONO #SONOS #stock today. Looks like a premium brand, like #Apple #AAPL, a worthy investment for debut price.  #stocks

681 2018-08-02 18:00:15 Hi Tweeps! Stocks looked slightly shaky this morning but now Wall Street is flat! The US-China trade situation rumbles on, but I can't really go into detail! Now in my box at the Royal Albert Hall with Marishka for tonight's #BBCProms - always great fun!

You don't even know what the crypto movement is about, you're just one of those day traders who couldn't make it in stocks, so you shifted to crypto. GTFO. The crypto you own was prolly used to buy CP at one point.

699 2018-08-02 17:52:24 Sold my position on $RGR today. It’s bittersweet, have been holding since 12/2015 and basically just made my money back on today’s 12% jump. Who else is holding? #stocks
700 2018-08-02 17:52:17 So if the private domain pooled together resources to buy Google, 4 million people,  only needing 10% of shareholders to pool there stocks into the slush and look mankind owns its data using online crowdsourcing
701 2018-08-02 17:51:59 Its sad that ppl are supposed to care at trillion dollar stocks when the rest of the world has so little, & we such big problems. We need to stop idolizing super wealth & start questioning how the world is like this.  This wld mean caring abt the poor, something yet to happen.

Wall Street will discover this hedge soon.

705 2018-08-02 17:50:37 When's the best time to buy stocks like Amazon .com (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Netflix (NFLX) and Nvidia (NVDA)? In a strong market uptrend as they break out of the kind of chart patterns that launch virtually all major moves.

710 2018-08-02 17:48:57 there is a reason capital first is at 550 and not at its 52 week high of 900. Coz they meet guidance
711 2018-08-02 17:48:40 Apple stocks are worth a trillion
712 2018-08-02 17:48:35 I am looking at individual stocks...nothing +3,4,5% moves.  Maybe .50 basis points or  1.00 basis point move here or there...reeks of January.  So it is literally indexing driving this pumping effect.  These ETFs are scary broken.  When they go...it will be like an incinerator
713 2018-08-02 17:48:33 Sure, but I'm diversifying. I'm not putting all eggs in one basket. I'm not buying bank stocks though 
714 2018-08-02 17:48:24 The problem with stocks/stockholders; how many of them play games and understand how gamers come to a decision of what they like to play and purchase. (No disrespect to stockholders).
715 2018-08-02 17:48:01 Its as Simple as This:  As Interest Rates Continue to Rise, So Will Bond Yields,
the Dollar & Growth Stocks—as Commodities ( Gold, Corn Etc.) & Bond Prices -Decline.
716 2018-08-02 17:47:55 Not touching #Gold until I see some kind of resolution of the trade dispute, a crash in US stocks, or a one-off devaluation of the yuan, signaling a ceiling in USD/CNY.
717 2018-08-02 17:47:49 With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you identify the best stocks to buy and to have on your watchlist? Start by regularly checking stock lists like Sector Leaders, IBD 50 and the IBD Big Cap 20, all of which have a proven track record of outperform
718 2018-08-02 17:47:46 if guidance is met, i dont consider it as a huge thing. Often Stock price factors in guidance

730 2018-08-02 17:43:44 And all the other sectors would be fully worker owned.  That would eliminate all stocks and small businesses.  This is not the “Scandinavian Socialism”.  This is communism.
731 2018-08-02 17:43:24 Went to give blood. Needle hurt like f.. a very hurty thing. Had to give up 2 mins in. But pain is RARE and stocks are LOW, so do give if you can 
732 2018-08-02 17:43:08 I know, was just thinking of the effect of traditional assets (real estate, stocks, etc) vs continous new supply that gets halved - same time crisis would occur. Also ROI is big part, however not the only one.
733 2018-08-02 17:43:04 sometimes its easier to do options over stocks especially when market gets choppy  or during earnings period.
734 2018-08-02 17:42:21 Well just think about what 2 stocks did for smash 4 and you can imagine how taking that away would hinder the growth of the game.

742 2018-08-02 17:39:04 Ya’ll be worrying about buying and flipping houses ya’ll need to be purchasing stocks . That’s the lowest investment with highest returns!
743 2018-08-02 17:38:30 Use Stash. But stocks generally go up and down. The key is to buy low and sell high. So say for instance right now netflix is about $346 a share. I predict in the future it going up to $500 per share. If it does then you'll make
744 2018-08-02 17:38:20 They are going to do very well through the holidays. Stocks are always volatile and don’t reflect future performance. I believe by the end of its second year in the market that the Switch will be closing in on 30 mil worldwide.
745 2018-08-02 17:38:05 Thank you for everything you donate to the Rotherham Foodbank.  At the moment we really need more stocks of

- long life milk 
if you can donate any of these items it would really help us to feed more local families in need.

He received time in prison for that and then time in 'the pillory' basically, stocks - publicly humiliated. Then he was a spy. Busy fella.
749 2018-08-02 17:37:44 As an amateur investor in the stock market , primarily through my 401k plan, it is exciting when quarterly earnings reports come out for my stocks. Some underperform, but some outperform expectations! # apple #sprouts

764 2018-08-02 17:33:31 I think timing is everything right now. Cannabis stocks in a downtrend. Big catalyst for $BEER will be the announcement of edibles/drinks legislation by the government. We already have a timeline, 1 year post legalization.
765 2018-08-02 17:32:35 If I get a tax cut and add value (improvements) to my building and buy a fleet of mercedes for delivery would that be CapEx? Maybe I'll even pay the building off and add even more to my value. Then I'll buy back stocks. The trickle down is minimal in that case.

People shouldn't:
1) Fall in love with any ticker
2) Tied up their money with an OTC/PINK stock, when there's a winner everyday
3) Believe any CEO
769 2018-08-02 17:31:02 Maybe @Apple should let people know that the iPhone isnt a stock that is traded. Maybe providing a disclaimer before i buy 8 of the new iPhones? Maybe letting me know i cant return used (slightly cracked) phones (stocks). Not a pleasant experience at all!! Unsatisfied customer!

773 2018-08-02 17:30:20 Agreed.  I think there's a lot of coloring right now, even on coated stocks, that's just too garish and saturated. Needs to be toned down a bit or simplified in some cases.

I'm a sucker for some great inking with some two-tone flats though. It just screams "fun".
774 2018-08-02 17:30:15 I miss MTVU. I don’t know stocks? @CheddarU
775 2018-08-02 17:29:42 Today would be the day I tell you I've never had the $$$ to buy any stocks, so I've never lost or gained, and alas...I'm not a bajillionaire. But think of all the tax $ I've saved. LOL
776 2018-08-02 17:29:16 Sell along the way up. Average in as prices go down.

You can do this with stocks and crypto right now. 

But most of you are too impatient and afraid.

Equities and crypto are testing whether you can overcome natural human emotions. 

Can you?
777 2018-08-02 17:28:38 Time to sell back NDX vs EM stocks

782 2018-08-02 17:24:01 It's so bad when management lie and state in emails things like all outstanding notes have been bought out then the dilution still caries on, and on, and on! Maybe they didn't know how many notes they had left!
783 2018-08-02 17:23:56 Apples the first company to reach a trillion dollars damn should have invested in their stocks instead of their products

788 2018-08-02 17:21:14 I think we signed Pederson and basically shouldn't have at the time, this is why we need to release the big earners, Stocks, Grounds, which in turn will give us scope to get some loans in, the board gambled and lost on HR getting us up
789 2018-08-02 17:20:55 When hearing prognosticators say whether the bull market in stocks is over, or not, investors may consider the actual performance track record, say 2007-09... of the person making the prediction.

791 2018-08-02 17:20:19 #LIZJNY Your $PBR trade today is very enlightening.  I added to my stable.  I wonder if this is a good strategy for other low cost high IV stocks.

793 2018-08-02 17:19:03 "take back the waters" & what will UK gain? Very little. For a start it would lose export markets. In any case, fish don't respect borders & stocks will continue to be managed internationally (no British fish). Fish will be traded for >important things, eg plane landing rights.

804 2018-08-02 17:15:55 We all know the market is never wrong, that's why we buy indexes rather than individual stocks.  We realize that we aren't as smart, motivated and brilliant as Wall Street.  It's true.  After all they have convinced the majority that 6% or 7% per annum is a fair return.

When...the automobile was going to obsolete the old streetcar...some decided that since nobody would want streetcar stocks, they’d buy them. That is ridiculous."
814 2018-08-02 17:12:23 Yes, there are other countries but like I said, the debt growth that has led to global growth is coming to a halt.  #stagflation is real and it will cause people to conserve more.  Look at car and home sales last month. Even the casino stocks are hurting.

881 2018-08-02 16:44:26 Lmfaoooo no you go to stock broker or you can go through an online brokerage, and if you go online you can just look at the market and see what stocks you wanna buy, and buy directly from the company so you get all the money you make and don’t have to pay a stock broker
882 2018-08-02 16:44:17 Absolutely. Slippage could be big. Then the transfer coefficient isn’t as high as I’d like. Even if the top quartile is very attractive you can easily pick the wrong coins within that. And time horizons in quant crypto is much shorter than in stocks. But there is still an edge
883 2018-08-02 16:42:56 Se contrasta las ventas con la oferta de cada campaña, por lo que no se consideran los stocks iniciales. Esto, sumado al diferencial de retenciones, ayuda a que el mercado de soja local muestre elevados carries más allá de que este año comercial va a terminar muy ajustado

Every argument you make is, literally, an appeal to ignorance or deception.
901 2018-08-02 16:36:11 You make a good point. I tended to sell stocks rather than reduce position size. I am left with a small number of companies & a portfolio that is very unbalanced.

908 2018-08-02 16:34:09 Why would someone or a group want to takeover $HMNY? 

Simple: To resell #MoviePass for a profit, also to benefit from the #stock price increase if profitability news is announced or a better projection is made public by the company. 

 HMNY is much more than MoviePass!!!

916 2018-08-02 16:32:21 Promoters have no strategy to teach you, they’re just manipulating you to pump stocks. The only one who wins in the long-run buying pumps is the promoter who creates them, not the guy who buys after the alert. Don't follow stock pumpers, learn the PROCESS!

930 2018-08-02 16:28:53 After the $tsla conference call yesterday and subsequent market reaction, I have decided to invest the long side of my portfolio into pot stocks and distilleries.

You can't argue with market forces this strong.

931 2018-08-02 16:28:40 w0of! Rigolo

enfin bref chaque Mag à son Dirigeant et ici c'est un mauvais
932 2018-08-02 16:28:02 I mean, they don’t put you in the stocks and tell your neighbors you voted for a pro-choice candidate, but they make it clear that God knows and is not happy.

934 2018-08-02 16:27:49 1/13/06:  “Team, it turned out that Michael Dell wasn't perfect at predicting the future. Based on today's stock market close, Apple is worth more than Dell. Stocks go up and down, and things may be different tomorrow, but I thought it was worth a moment of reflection today.”
935 2018-08-02 16:27:48 Everyone should get free $TSLA and $AMZN stocks because both get the biggest breaks at cost to the taxpayers and cities they move to.
936 2018-08-02 16:27:17 Now the shorts have lost $1.1billion to Tesla stocks. Lol dumbos betting against Tesla. The troll tactics failed.
937 2018-08-02 16:27:11 Im bouta start sellings cars so hopefully 4k a month on my way too. then you gotta do due diligence Learn investments, stocks n bonds, crypto. cuz unless economics get better which i highly doubt we def not retiring before we die lol
938 2018-08-02 16:27:11 That is, lots of Koreans and Japanese stocks have market caps in in the trillions. So it would have been there on day one.

944 2018-08-02 16:25:42 I had to advice a client to sell @flyspicejet stock. 

Was a tough contrarian call at the peak of the frenzy in aviation stocks. 

Oil prices were at the bottom. 

#ContrarianInvesting is also about selling when everybody else is bullish.
945 2018-08-02 16:25:32 Sir, 1. @LICIndiaForever doesn't need @IDBI_Bank for it's product selling. 2. LIC can invest it's money in better stocks than IDBI Bank and generate enormous value. @PiyushGoyal we are listening you carefully and making our mind for @2019Election
946 2018-08-02 16:25:18 If I would've invested $1 in 1980 for Apple I would now own $50,000 in Apple stocks. What has my life come to?

948 2018-08-02 16:25:07 The available share count would be much less if the cooperative or hostile takeover happens. 

 THINK: If they gain control, why would I want to issue shares that that would take them below 51%
949 2018-08-02 16:25:03 I know but I really need deva curl here I see everyone improvement due to the diffuser of deva curl in america and I am here like urgh Shea Mouister always run out of stocks in shops....
950 2018-08-02 16:24:39 Currently, 33.6% of the TSX is in financial stocks, 20.8% in energy and 12.9% in materials. That’s over two-third of the TSX in these three sectors, with only small allocations to important stock sectors like consumer (9.3%), information technology (2.8%) and healthcare (0.6%).
951 2018-08-02 16:23:46 Elon should stop crying, people will continue shorting Tesla stocks
952 2018-08-02 16:23:38 $TROV goes to .70 then .80 back and forth. Can it ever get back over 1.00 though 
953 2018-08-02 16:23:37 I have written to my local reps with no response. I did site it as SAofC as you say but it didn’t seem to matter. This year has been particularly bad for the fish stocks and it’s not just the weather. Also, seeing an Otter sitting atop a tractor tyre is quite disheartening
954 2018-08-02 16:23:32 Not for the trust fund babies tho.  They’ll be fine. Their trusts might even be able to pick up some cheap stocks on the TSE.
955 2018-08-02 16:23:26 okay, may konting hope pa, baka talagang yung 3 items na yun lang yung may extra stocks for overseas stop for now since siyempre ipa prioritize nila yung mga di pa tapos na venue sa Korea. JEONGMAL REALLY PLEASE LET US HAVE A MANILA VERSION OF THE LIGHTBAND STRAPS

965 2018-08-02 16:21:52 Invest 500k in stocks. 100k in options. Then with the 400k find a business I can partner in or improve.
966 2018-08-02 16:21:35 New highs off a base are a good time to buy stocks. I’m looking at you, $AAPL. Just don’t chase past a proper buy point.
967 2018-08-02 16:20:52 Can probably let you off then
968 2018-08-02 16:20:06 Slowly getting into stocks, I feel like $FB is a good buy here, might get involved. Otherwise I bought $SQ before earnings and $AMD a couple months back. Sold $NVDA & $INTC.

974 2018-08-02 16:17:32 Waiting for the float to get bought up during the potential upcoming BUYOUT.

 Less $HMNY shares available will drive the #stock price back up faster than bashing bears can cover.
975 2018-08-02 16:16:37 Wish I had stocks with Apple now 
976 2018-08-02 16:16:10 Checking out investor information for some beer companies and noticing a bump in prices late May/early June. Interestingly marijuana stocks tend to bump around then too. Is it just cause school's out and people like to party? Are we that predictable as a species? Yes and yes

979 2018-08-02 16:15:07 The number 1 cut in corporate America is 401k & pensions Seriously outside of government jobs tell me one company that offers a pension to new employees.  The fact remains only 1/2 of Americans own stock, & the top 5% own 66% of all stocks.  49% of Americans live check to check
980 2018-08-02 16:14:34 I know it’s not your job anymore but as a personal favour please interrogate these shoppes about their Delilah Dirk stocks.

981 2018-08-02 16:14:23 $PVNC this could be the RM thats coming.  Addys match up on PVNCs filings.  Could be used for another RM not sure  just guessing at this point.  But these Malaysians usually get their stocks to multi dollars 3 4 5 6 bucks a lot of times.  Could get cheap bid shares imo
982 2018-08-02 16:14:15 TIL: "Since 2011, Denmark has had zero cases of human salmonella poisoning. The country eradicated salmonella without vaccines and antibiotics by focusing on eliminating the infection from 'breeder stocks'"

985 2018-08-02 16:13:44 How many stocks are like this. Anyone with a modicum of valuation knowledge knows the companies will never fill their valuation shoes... but as long as the greater fool exists, they’ll keep going up. NFLX, W, SHOP, TSLA, etc.
986 2018-08-02 16:13:34 The bears are going to make the bulls look good by trying to make $HMNY & #MoviePass look bad.. 

 TOO MANY BASHING BEARS IS ALWAYS A BULLISH SIGN
987 2018-08-02 16:13:30 I got you. Start by googling stock options. It’s an easier way to control a lot of stocks without actually having them. It’s for people with less than $1000 to initially invest
988 2018-08-02 16:13:18 No transparency here.  Much better stocks out there.  Maybe no news because they are not doing anything anyway.  Nice pipe dream though.  Seems like a #homebasedbusiness. Maybe $TNY is just a Farmer’s Market type product.
989 2018-08-02 16:13:08 $SPY at hod (281.50), but I'm looking for stocks to short.  Don't think this rally will last.
990 2018-08-02 16:12:55 The richest 10% own more than 80% of all stocks, betting on emerging markets seems more wise
991 2018-08-02 16:12:26 When I was 13 I asked my dad for apple stock for my birthday! I was a loyal “MacAddict” subscriber and knew nothing for stocks, expect apple was low and I was a believer in them. He said no 

Well today Apple is the first company to grow to a Trillion Dollars valuation...
992 2018-08-02 16:12:15 The top five stocks lower at noon today are $TRIP, $HFC, $WLTW, $UNM, and $CTSH.

999 2018-08-02 16:10:32 There’s still no underlying value. It has to collapse at some point. I prefer buy-and-hold stocks. I still remember all those who took a bath when the Clinton internet bubble burst.
1000 2018-08-02 16:10:31 The top five most active stocks at noon today are $AAPL, $AMD, $BAC, $MGM, $GE, and $MU.

1002 2018-08-02 16:09:34 Oddly I still have the framed Stock Certificates. They don't even issues certificates like that if you know anything about stocks.
1003 2018-08-02 16:09:32 So if I buy like 10 stocks for moviepass I can either make it big or be out a grand total of $2
1004 2018-08-02 16:08:55 Apple (AAPL) is now worth "$1 Trillion" but not for long. Tech and the FANG stocks are due for a serious correction. It is just a matter of when.
1005 2018-08-02 16:07:43 Ron Wayne’s $800 sale of his OG stocks would now be worth $100BILLION.
1006 2018-08-02 16:07:35 If I had $1,000,000 right now, I'm investing $100k in marketing my biz, buying a small apartment complex and hiring a property manager ($500k), Putting $125k in a mutual fund, $25k in more volatile stocks, $50k to the fam to pay off all debts.. $200k down on a house & studio.
1007 2018-08-02 16:07:16 What other stocks do you like?
1008 2018-08-02 16:07:09 These stocks?
1009 2018-08-02 16:07:06 Ok.. so now its crypto and fang stocks.
1010 2018-08-02 16:06:48 A buddy of mine sold his Apple in exchange for a bunch of marijuana penny stocks a few years ago. Apple is now the first company to ever reach $1 trillion market cap. $AAPL $MJNA

1012 2018-08-02 16:06:28 One day ppl will discuss how America Corp barons robbed the ppl, lobbied govt for corp tax cuts, used money to buy back stocks to drive up stock price, and now lobbing president to issue capital gains tax reprieve...what is taxed at capital gains rate? sell of stocks
1013 2018-08-02 16:05:44 If i could go back 10 - 15 years, although i was young AF, I’d somehow convince my entire family to invest all their savings into technology stocks 
1014 2018-08-02 16:05:37 Tyre Stocks are looking good in general. Tomorrow how they behave that has to be observed closely. Gradually can be added. Lets see.
1015 2018-08-02 16:05:12 this just not true In the 90s everyone thought they could become millionaires by investing in internet stocks. am I missing some irony here !
1016 2018-08-02 16:05:06 $BTGI yet again the importance of loading stocks on the Watch List when initially alerted and during quiet periods shown - there were a few days to grab .0003s after the .0002s got bought out and many failed to take it
1017 2018-08-02 16:04:54 BEARS ARE BASHING WAY TOO MUCH!! That’s a great sign for smart bulls to key  in on..

1020 2018-08-02 16:04:09 That's correct as seeing selling continue yesterday on many uranium stocks by URA, seems energy fuels is being hit today even with the new bill for restricting uranium from russia announced.
1021 2018-08-02 16:03:54 Nope. Don't do individual stocks anymore
1022 2018-08-02 16:03:54 Those people that bought hundred of stocks in the beginning... JESUS
1023 2018-08-02 16:03:39 very true. Markets never ending aspect with no "answer key" allows for false narratives. Stocks continuous ebb and flow based on many variables that are never 100% conclusive, make people prone to accept some common sense reason even if not correct. It keeps moving!
1024 2018-08-02 16:03:24 Those were just from the house list of stocks that regularly respond to position-building leveraged activity that we measure. Of course there isn’t just one system of trading that can outperform, so long as it’s based in logic, quantitatively sound, & repeatable.

1033 2018-08-02 16:01:06 wish theyd do regular updates on:

-Oil spilled on our land & who's responsible
-Civilians hurt or killed by our military or $ support
-Polling information of all kinds & accurate exit polling after elections
-Police violence & sexual assaults

Forget stocks, update these numbers
1034 2018-08-02 16:01:05 I'm not touting anything. I still hold #icx, just as a macro view this whole alt market looks very much like bleeding penny stocks after huge bull runs. 95% of these projects are garbage and finding the 1-5% that might actually show traction is hard.
1035 2018-08-02 16:00:52 Yes, DB is up 0.2 or so since I made the post. 

At present my Broker has stopped us trading single company shares and so my charts on stocks relate not to short term but longer term positioning.

I must monitor anyway for both sentiment and my other assets in pensions etc
1036 2018-08-02 16:00:44 @thiagocaproni some of these stocks tend to be what’s called one way stocks.  Once they start trending it’s a long time before turning round

There were winners in the Obama economy...the green policies were advocated, and technological stocks did rise within that sector, but manufacturing, energy and outsourcing of jobs, combined with illegal immigration stymied economic growth.
1064 2018-08-02 15:47:56 one last question..not sure about the dividend part..actually IBULHSG has declared the dividend of Rs. 10/-. I bought some stocks today. Will I b eligible for the dividend? and if I am, then till when I need to hold these stocks? Thanks in advance.

1100 2018-08-02 15:32:14 Stocks are priced off of the past, value is determined by the future.

If you buy a stock that has compounded at 15% for many years, that expectation is already in the price. Think horse betting.

You only capture the excess return above what's already reflected in today's price.

1158 2018-08-02 15:12:40 I have. $BBRY (when it was $RIMM). Same people were telling me it was a value play, and telling $AAPl was over valued at that time and didn't have a chance. Also happy to avoid stocks that are "hideously over-valued"
1159 2018-08-02 15:12:36 Let me get this straight! $HMNY has about 1.7M shares outstanding. If you have $140,000 laying around and decided to buy that much in stocks at it's current price, you'll own 59% of the company with 3 million subscribers paying you about $10.00 a month.

1170 2018-08-02 15:07:10 yes i have deleted my original tweet and corrected, apple did not properly update the threshold in its stocks app
1171 2018-08-02 15:06:56 I stand corrected. On Wednesday, Apple announced an adjusted share count, which is now 4,829,926,000. According to CNBC, the new count means that Apple's stock will be required to reach $207.05. So websites and even Apple’s own Stocks app are wrong.
1172 2018-08-02 15:06:34 #CORRECTION: The Apple stocks app is WRONG and the company has NOT yet hit the Trillion mark. The company did not properly adjust the threshold. Shares must surpass $207 a piece to hit $1T, currrently sitting at $205.57
1173 2018-08-02 15:06:07 So in the month of july, after losses and commission fees i made a whopping $800 on otc (scam stocks). Its a lot like trading cryptocurrency. Fundamentals are everything, and reading the orderbook is key

1199 2018-08-02 14:56:50 Interesting note. Mr Buffett doesn’t use an iPhone. Instead he uses an old flip phone. He was also late to investing in tech stocks. However, it looks like he’s making up for it, as Apple is now Berkshire’s largest investment.

1230 2018-08-02 14:45:16 Yeah, well you probably know this, but stocks are like checkers while options are like chess. Far more nuanced, which means more flexibility for profit/loss. Flexibility is good, but it takes a while to understand when/where/how.

All is subjective therefore advice has to be 'as is' and based on facts/data/risks etc imo.

1370 2018-08-02 14:03:11 That makes sense. I was seeing the opposite POV: presenting exhibits that arguably introduce bias risks a Manafort appeal, so why do so when less evocative but compelling evidence were already in play.

1466 2018-08-02 13:19:06 I can imagine that this period feels the same as in 2010, when the stock markets crashed. ‘Stocks are dead’. 

Should be the same now, some alts are hanging towards it, some are just pressed down.

It’s about perspective and future believes. The real winners are made here.

1468 2018-08-02 13:18:36 Just need to react accordingly and respect price action. Have a plan if it trends down out of the gate and if it trends higher. Going long or short i'd wait for trends to confirm/hold especially given how stocks like $AWX have traded. Stay safe. Predicting the moves is dangerous.

1582 2018-08-02 12:21:58 I never read headlines beyond 'as' or 'on' any financial data sites I view for different market moves. For eg. Stocks futures fall as... European markets up on... China index down as... ... And I am doing good on my trades.

1711 2018-08-02 10:56:20 Yes I agree, and particularly if the real facts on EV growth are presented to the market so investors can make informed choices. Good Lithium stocks will transition quite nicely from construction to producers and it will be a story few can deny and over many years to come.

1716 2018-08-02 10:52:29 I am not convinced we will be able to do that. Stocks must be sustainable. Also fish swim to colder waters so it may all be a pipe dream with climate change. Why risk other businesses for one that can be very risky for people’s lives?

1751 2018-08-02 10:24:57 More passive investors means fewer active investors. Active investors drive price discovery (i.e. "correct" pricing of stocks) so the market will become less efficient, therefore increasing size/frequency of mispricings and opportunities for active investors to buy low sell high.

2192 2018-08-02 04:02:21 Dissapointed with Pidilite results. HEG seems to be going up and up, not sure how long this rally will go #stocks
2193 2018-08-02 04:01:06 Is it good time to buy @MoviePass stocks ?
2194 2018-08-02 04:00:02 Stocks are bought not in fear but in hope. They are typically sold out of fear.
2195 2018-08-02 03:59:52 Lo bueno de andar de curioso en los stocks de emergencias o en los servicios Jajajajaja
2196 2018-08-02 03:59:36 Sell 1SD strangles on high IVR stocks and indexes. For stocks in portfolio sell put side covered straddles and for stocks to add to portfolio sell call side covered straddles.
2197 2018-08-02 03:59:09 Tech stocks jacked up, rates rising, dislocations in the FX market, Hang Seng tanking. Feels like I have seen this before, probably while most of you were watching Little Bear on Noggin in the late 90s
2198 2018-08-02 03:59:04 Like I said...anyone that pays taxes will not want to pay through the nose. I'm not willing to cough up half my check. Now, folks like you who get more money back in the form of tax refunds than the taxes actually paid would love nothing more than to ride our backs.
2199 2018-08-02 03:58:30 Ppl rushing to buy asm exclusions now... didnt they find the quality when the same stocks were available dirt cheap? #buy high sell lowfunny
2200 2018-08-02 03:57:11 The difference is the VA is socialized medicine where single payer is socialized insurance while keeping the medical side privatized. The government already does and can handle medical billing while hospitals, doctors offices etc remain the way they are.
2201 2018-08-02 03:55:02 Of course. But the correct response then would be to tackle at source, no? To think about food stocks,  supply side remedies, and to give the RBI the flexibility to not have to mechanically respond with rate policy.
2202 2018-08-02 03:54:48 Few stocks came out from ASM list. 
Bhanshali Engineering polymers,
Himadri speciality chem, etc. Total 9 stocks. 
Bhanshali Engineering is a pick. 
Himadri and Thirumalai also got mention in my blog.

2204 2018-08-02 03:54:00 It's not about the cute little plastic guns (& it's limited market of terrorists & hobbyists) it's about downloadable 'schematics for weapons' & various 'add ons'. Think printable bump stocks & other components to turn legal guns into auto-killing machines. Custom parts market.

2215 2018-08-02 03:48:21 Unpopular opinion: equity markets and technology are making new because of a flat yield curve. A more inverted curve is only going to push stocks higher

2232 2018-08-02 03:27:14 Bump stocks are only illegal in some states. Several manufacturers have ceased to mfg them though. Without the rapid firing capabilities, less damage would be done. What about high capacity magazines. Again, doing nothing at all is not the answer.

2254 2018-08-02 03:12:07 Consider it a variation of a FoF that cuts out the second layer of fees. Instead of investing in the funds directly, the fund is investing in stocks the various funds submit.

AIRASIA vs AIRPORT

The airlines industry is undergoing some structural changes. One of the issue is the passenger service charge (PSC).

Lower PSC means lower fares attracts more flyers for AIRASIA, while higher PSC would boost AIRPORT's returns.

He can't sell them, because that would crash the price of them, and people would lose their jobs... So he pays his employees bonuses with them.

2362 2018-08-02 02:02:35 The stock market, for example, is sort of like trading cards for businesses. The market measures how popular companies are with the kind of people who buy stocks, not the actual success & health of the business.

Stock buybacks—the practice by which companies purchase shares of their own stocks with profits, savings, or debt—are taking thousands of dollars away from employees who would have otherwise seen raises, contributing to working-class wage stagnation..

2405 2018-08-02 01:25:24 I get the high yield spread thing, but a huge drop in energy costs is quite stimulative (with some lag) and tends to support higher consumer spending and GDP. Usually bullish for stocks. In retrospect, the capital destroyed was a drop in the bucket.

Do you mean that #laws actually help prevent gun violence after all?

Let's create LAWS banning #BUMP Stocks and Assault Rifles then!
2440 2018-08-02 00:55:15 That is a relevant question.  I think fund companies and their sales teams use “pro” to infer that PM skill in picking stocks is similar to a pro athlete’s skill in dominating a sport.  But which pro sport has millions of competitors with similar education, experience, skills?
2441 2018-08-02 00:53:41 God bless you! The NRA’s stances are so extreme—it’s like they oppose any gun control measures whatsoever. What’s wrong with waiting periods? Or banning bump stocks? Or banning the sale of military grade weapons? Common sense measures aren’t much to ask.

2446 2018-08-02 00:52:12 "Don't just do something, sit there!"  Bored and restless investors take on risk.  Timing markets, picking stocks, chasing yields.  Not investing, but speculating.  Good investing = excitement of watching paint dry.  Get your excitement elsewhere. Money is for boring funds.

2448 2018-08-02 00:51:53 Ironic. The stocks are high because of the people who gripe that companies like this could pay off the US debt, yet still give money to them despite the fact that these companies have no interest in helping the economy.
2449 2018-08-02 00:49:47 Promoters have no strategy to teach you, they’re just manipulating you to pump stocks. The only one who wins in the long-run buying pumps is the promoter who creates them, not the guy who buys after the alert. If you’re not first, you you’ll be last. Stuck bag holding
2450 2018-08-02 00:48:10 Mr Molasses when he doesn’t want to something like cyber security or bump stocks.  Took him & Pence over a year to start & then all they could manage was blaming Obama.
2451 2018-08-02 00:47:31 If sb tells you that he knows what's gonna happen in 5 yrs don't trust him.  We all agree that #U price is going higher, how higher can just speculate, may take 3,4 yrs but we gonna test the 2011 heights.  Stocks will follow from the small U123 company to the blue chip producers.

2453 2018-08-02 00:45:20 Passive funds are now offering 0% fees.

Blindly pumping money into a pool of the largest market cap stocks has performed pretty well in recent bull market conditions but surely it doesn't end well.

2474 2018-08-02 00:29:11 When a stocks at $27 and you say it’s going to $18 in 1 Hour and it does... can you imagine how much hate you’ll get from the people who lost money betting against you? Tons of hate, tons of fake accounts, they blew up their acckunt. What do you expect
2475 2018-08-02 00:29:04 Ustedes desde los medios no le dieron "pelota" a este tema: tuvieron ocasión cuando Javiera Blanco entregó su triste informe de "stocks" (niños muertos); luego a fines de 2016, con el revuelo de las denuncias de Saffirio en @Tolerancia0 .Y eligieron enredarse en cosas laterales

2479 2018-08-02 00:25:50 How about banning bump stocks. How about banning weapons of war. How about limiting the amount of artillery. How about limiting the amount of ammo....to start.
2480 2018-08-02 00:23:59 @jimcramer hey Jim I have three energy stocks my grandfather bought me when I was born. Have turned into big winners but I’m looking to diversify more. What should I do with FE, AGR, WEC?
2481 2018-08-02 00:22:56 How would a wall prevent a local from buying dozens of rifles, unlimited ammo, bump stocks, rent a room and begin shooting out a hotel room?

I don't understand your question.
2482 2018-08-02 00:22:54 Will this help my stocks rise? Asking for my wallet 
2483 2018-08-02 00:22:52 ok, i was hoping there would be a way to add as many stocks as i could to the porfolio without using multiple pies

2488 2018-08-02 00:16:48 $ETE & $ETP are merging. $ETE will remain. The combined entity will have the best oil and gas infrastructure assets in the country. At current prices the stocks are trading at >10X EBITDA,  comps trade at 12X, this is the catalyst that will drive value. BUY
2489 2018-08-02 00:14:29 Exactly?? Ugh idk YG’s strategy is towards this but it’s no wonder why their business stocks are going way down unlike before  they really treat their artists not so well!
2490 2018-08-02 00:10:58 How many 3d guns or bump stocks have you used.  Is this on purpose.  Probably.  You guys suck.
2491 2018-08-02 00:10:12 Great to see $AJM and $PLS kicking goals in #Pilgangoora. What many of us have followed for a few years finally moving to major producers. It's been a long road of highs, frustrations, rivalry and all the rest of the nonsense. The end game is what it's all about. Two great stocks
2492 2018-08-02 00:09:59 Tesla $tsla Electrifies with over 9% surge after a solid performance by @elonmusk !! In a treacherous economic and political environment like today, Elon Musk knows how to adapt. Current price $329. Could easily go to $400 by end of year. #teslaearnings #elonmusk #tesla #stocks
2493 2018-08-02 00:09:29 Ah, but which stocks?
2494 2018-08-02 00:09:12 Asia stocks begin lower after the mostly negative close on Wall St amid increased trade tensions with the US considering raising tariffs on USD 200bln of China goods to 25% from 10% and with China also threatening to retaliate; ASX 200 (-0.2%), Nikkei 225 (-0.3%), KOSPI (-0.2%)
2495 2018-08-02 00:08:45 To be perfectly honest I also have long campaigned against the low stocks of prawn sandwiches and champers at many football functions.
2496 2018-08-02 00:07:53 My biggest hesitation on the $TSLA short case comes from my hero @AlderLaneeggs, "short stocks people won't miss".. Regardless of all the reasonable anti-Tesla arguments, Tesla drivers are like annoying vegans- they will let you know they drive a Tesla at any second in any convo.

2501 2018-08-02 00:03:43 I wish to establish red flag laws, universal background checks and licensure process for different types of firearms. This allows for oversight of those who possess weapons along with allowing people’s rights to self-defense and sport. Ban bump stocks nationally.
