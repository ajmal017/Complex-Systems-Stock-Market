36 2018-11-04 23:57:21 How do people put soap on their eyelids & not get it in their eyes? Every time I wash my face & go over my eyes I'm left w/ an acid feeling in my eyes lol. So when it comes to cleaning that area I usually stick to oil cleansers, which amazingly doesn't get in my eyes.

55 2018-11-04 23:55:07 I know America is the "evil empire", but it doesn't change the fact that Putin is grabbing oil assets through loans to Caracas, while he keeps supporting a corrupt regime. He's just an opportunist like many other " leaders of the free world".

98 2018-11-04 23:49:54 Unfortunately, that's what happens when you super heat your economy with oil money, then borrow to build a massive dam while the oil economy falls. A wise, moderate approach to spending from 2003 would have made NL economically sustainable - not any more #nlpoli

Personally in a post indy Scotland, i would be glad to see us continue to help you guys down South out. You're gonna need it.
150 2018-11-04 23:43:41 Brought my pick and pink oil !
151 2018-11-04 23:43:38 Just watched the first episode on your rec and am absolutely smitten! I also just spent waaaaay too much money on Ligurian olive oil online. That’s the problem with me and cooking shows....
152 2018-11-04 23:43:34 my ass to fat no to have it rubbed with baby oil every night. 
153 2018-11-04 23:43:33 Jay.. your stupidity continues to astound! You forced the oil companies to spend $28 million to fight 1631 and that cost just hit us at the gas pumps. You are the liar and all who believe that humans can control climate are dumber than you! Vote NO on this #Democrat tax scam.
154 2018-11-04 23:43:30 Beto won't win, he was never going to win even though the media pushed this guy like a rockstar. He is against oil and guns. Know your constituents..
155 2018-11-04 23:43:30 Monday: taking car in for an oil change & stalking Target for mini Christmas Trees. 
Tuesday: VOTING & going to see “Bohemian Rhapsody”. 
Wednesday - Friday: try to take over the world.
156 2018-11-04 23:43:29 Sardine oil
157 2018-11-04 23:43:27 I stocked up on my oil... I'm thinking double, maybe triple doses on Tuesday. I'll probably have to use the one infused with valerian root to calm my ass down during the day ;)
158 2018-11-04 23:43:24 Ill bring some almond oil to rub them down  (provided theres no nut allergy )
159 2018-11-04 23:43:19 Tea tree oil smells so dam good
160 2018-11-04 23:43:07 Yeah it was rly sweet...sometimes i still like, do lavender/tea tree oil steams or jst drop some on my bedclothes cus it soothes
161 2018-11-04 23:42:32 Man if people are going to smoke inside they should use a filter. I have a paper towel tube stuffed with fabric softeners that I blow my smoke through so it doesn't stink anything up.

Strong candles and peppermint oil can help cancel out the smell.
162 2018-11-04 23:42:26 That’s a generous use of the word “comedian”. I change my own oil a few times. I’m no mechanic.
163 2018-11-04 23:42:06 @POTUS Why don't you sanction transport companies, e.g. ship and plane owners, that transport stolen gold from Venezuela ? Same with stolen oil that goes to Cuba etc. Same in Iran ??
164 2018-11-04 23:42:05 #China will start buying #US oil, and that will trickle down to #LTC the new #currency!!! Buy #LTC #BTC #ETH now!
165 2018-11-04 23:41:55 That cat belongs in an oil painting.
166 2018-11-04 23:41:47 @marcorubio Why don't you sanction transport companies, e.g. ship and plane owners, that transport stolen gold from Venezuela ? Same with stolen oil that goes to Cuba etc. Same in Iran ??
167 2018-11-04 23:41:34 I know there are very few examples of single or primary resource economies that are successful or stable as anything but kleptocracies.  Norway and the other Scandinavian oil sheikdoms are about it.
168 2018-11-04 23:41:33 I don’t think her tansy oil will help him at this point (didn’t work for Marsali either apparently )

185 2018-11-04 23:39:42 If you have not voted yet in CO, vote #YESon112 Tuesday #Colorado. It's about public safety and quality of life, not loss of jobs. Don't be fooled by oil & gas industry.
186 2018-11-04 23:39:41 It would have been so much better if they were completely upfront with their intention to butt fuck us.

This snake oil shit is so much more annoying IMO
187 2018-11-04 23:39:30 Colin overheard us kidding around once, and jumped in with "What's a Wesson Oil party?"
188 2018-11-04 23:39:11 I told my sister about @DavidDobrik 's vlog where he made his friends drink oil in corona bottles and she immediately assumed I meant engine oil. She was seriously concerned for their health. I think that says something about his videos 
189 2018-11-04 23:39:11 We're sentient patches of oil swept along down corridors of shadow. #cyberpunk

#SongsAndFilmsFoundOnBeaches
191 2018-11-04 23:38:51 what kind of oil did you pour
192 2018-11-04 23:38:43 とても美味しかった(朝飯)
193 2018-11-04 23:38:32 Let's face it, Revs no oil painting (sorry Jon), but Laura's stunning. What you on about fool?
194 2018-11-04 23:38:24 Fuck, even the shitty ones in Brazil are at least 10% olive oil (15% usually).
195 2018-11-04 23:38:08 My dad is dope. Filled my tank and topped off my oil. I’m forever a daddy’s girl.
196 2018-11-04 23:38:05 Just found out I need to replace my oil valves and that'll cost me $722.. At this point I might as well. I'll find my way out there at some point within 10 months I'm sure. Just can't afford anything more than like $100 a month so I'm outta luck for now
197 2018-11-04 23:38:03 Well your home heating oil will likely be higher this year.  Cold hitting early, and storage levels below last year's
198 2018-11-04 23:37:58 my beloved rose hip oil 
199 2018-11-04 23:37:52 Idk cheaper oil? Defense? Whatever you guys think war is good for.
200 2018-11-04 23:37:30 They are upset because the club currently at the top is making the mockery out of the integrity of the game.  Hopefully at end of season its not that dirty oil club that is at the top.
201 2018-11-04 23:37:24 Use tea tree oil and water in a spray bottle! It works great!
202 2018-11-04 23:37:17 Jamaican black castor shampoo and texture id deep condition hair mask and the Jamaican black castor oil conditioner
203 2018-11-04 23:36:54 Yeah, like a snake oil salesman
204 2018-11-04 23:36:50 and what about pipelines to get our oil to world markets
205 2018-11-04 23:36:43 they just keep digging that hole deeper
206 2018-11-04 23:36:39 What’s going on with these essential oil marketing people?? R they okay because It’s literally impossible to be that excited about selling fucking essential oils

From which reason the army is in foreign countries?
From ww2 North America didnt get out of wars
The countries that you attack for oil and other reason are not guilty.
You must stop being inocent victims becouse r are not!
211 2018-11-04 23:36:05 Shouldn't avocado oil have the highest smoke point?
212 2018-11-04 23:35:59 There is man/male and woman/female defined by their biological differences. I'm not buying your snake oil.

222 2018-11-04 23:33:49 My local monster is big oil...
223 2018-11-04 23:33:47 Just ordered a battery-powered lawnmower with a mulching feature for my poor, badly-damaged lawn.  Hoping that the mulching will help repair the soil damage and it has a bonus factor of not adding more gas and oil to the wetlands that border the yard on 2 sides.
224 2018-11-04 23:33:39 Literally: to sell oil
225 2018-11-04 23:33:08 Sunday Sermon : Your Ye will never lack. Your oil will always be poignant. 
226 2018-11-04 23:33:03 This one be oil paint
227 2018-11-04 23:33:02 Fry it quickly in oil and garlic
228 2018-11-04 23:33:01 "Not degrowth in the simplistic sense of an economy where someone has found a dial that governs the size of the Gross Domestic Product". There is such a dial; it is the number of business licenses issued. Just tear up some oil company business licenses, and all will be well.
229 2018-11-04 23:32:52 100 people are leading the climate to catastrophe. They are billionaire shareholders of petroleum and oil production. "Little steps" aren't the way to stop that, especially ones that place the burden on poor, disempowered folks. Only massive social revolution will save us.
230 2018-11-04 23:32:51 Iran has one refinery. They have oil but no refining capacity to speak of. One bomb and they would need to ship fuel in. One or two sunken ships and that becomes impossible. Threatening to sink tankers in the region is literally suicidal to their economy and their regime.
231 2018-11-04 23:32:34 hai bunny, betul ke kalau oily dehydrated kurang sesuai guna cleansing oil ? blh buat kulit lagi kering ke? tq 
232 2018-11-04 23:32:26 If 9/11 didn’t make a dent nothing will... until their oil runs out.

238 2018-11-04 23:31:07 What you are doing is putting oil on war fire on Syria. You never help them. You are working hard for devide them a part , hate each other, keep fighting. buy air ticket to Damascus. Look what’s going on there. talk after that.
239 2018-11-04 23:31:06 @DoctorKarl if I fry an egg without oil or butter in a non stick pan is it any less healthy to eat than poaching an egg in boiling water?
240 2018-11-04 23:30:58 maybe also his straight talk (non refined) and his non shiny and smooth talking BS politician con artistry. Because of Trump, now you have people who prefer to be lied to by professional snake oil salesmen we call politicians -they want to be told sweet tales that mean nothing
241 2018-11-04 23:30:55 الله يصبركم ويجبركم .
ويرحم والدكم ويقتص ممن ظلموه في الدنيا والآخرة .
242 2018-11-04 23:30:40 So, ginising ako ng pinsan ko kase walang tubig pangshower, pano na toooo, naglagay pa ako ng castor oil sa buhok kagabi.
243 2018-11-04 23:30:13 We used to have these like? Little gelcaps of strongsmelling oil that we'd rip open and drip on our bedclothes tht would help clear our airways but i can't remember what it actually was
244 2018-11-04 23:29:53 Fracking shale to get oil&gas for privileged CO2 polluter addicts like us, is making unaffordable #ClimateBreakdown calculable and near. I stopped flying in 2012 and now finding same rationale then applies now to most personal vehicles. Yeah we’re addicts, withdrawal really sucks
245 2018-11-04 23:29:52 Yeah, they have strength and depth in every position. I think Klopp is a genius, and I wouldn’t swap him for enybody, not even Pep, but I don’t think we can compete with their oil money, sadly...
246 2018-11-04 23:29:48 rub you down in the baby oil. now you shining, look just like a diamond.

248 2018-11-04 23:29:07 Hi Emma, do you mind me asking how the mAgnesium oil helps?
249 2018-11-04 23:29:07 Build a wall with sensors; every time it senses a climber, have some form of grease or cooking oil automatically ooze from pores, & circular blades pop pit to cut ropes
250 2018-11-04 23:28:56 *Not claiming this is healthy for you or keto friendly or vegan, but it is SO good!

-Probably a tablespoon of coconut oil
- a heap of nut butter 
-like a teaspoon of vanilla extract if you want 
-a couple of tablespoons of honey. Maybe 3... if you want..
-a heap or two of cacao
251 2018-11-04 23:28:46 This weekend is sponsored by my ability to read fucking directions

253 2018-11-04 23:28:41 Calling out my car people.!!! 

If anyone can give me any feedback on K&N oil filters I’d gladly appreciate it 
254 2018-11-04 23:28:38 I have become over-sensitive to pain because of painkillers and here in the UK CBD oil is not an option - HUGE pity.
255 2018-11-04 23:28:19 Slow Moe uses a bus to do a club crawl. Unless it runs on chip oil. Way to look after the environment. P.M.!
256 2018-11-04 23:28:08 My daddy’s washing my car & taking it to get an oil change tomorrow  bless him 
257 2018-11-04 23:28:07 Nah, the proponents of so-called trickle-down know it's snake oil. They weren't trying to do anything other than oppress the masses who have a taste for snake oil.
258 2018-11-04 23:27:59 You are exporting Canadian oil for under $20 a barrel and importing Saudi oil for over $60. 
If you plan was to leave Canadians with record debt (= more taxes later to pay it off) and drive record of investment out of Canada then your plan is working.
259 2018-11-04 23:27:50 If Gartman is bullish on the price of oil, then I say with absolute certainty that Iran won't do it.
260 2018-11-04 23:27:49 Brother, you are preaching to the choir! What will it take to convince his base and the GOP that Trump is a snake oil salesman?!?!
261 2018-11-04 23:27:47 So Unfortunate that the beauty industry has not figured out men make up and so our grooming remains very basic. 

I've tried what @PhathuMakwarela has suggested in terms of some amla or Jamaican castor oil but it doesn't really give the shine I want
262 2018-11-04 23:27:46 @POTUS Mr President, asking you to cut our gasoline  prices in America. We are suppose to hve more than middle east now. If your selling oil to other countries. How abt a little for us. Thank you.

WAS AMAZING CONTROL & EXPOSURE OF CORRUPTION
WHO WAS INVOLVED ???
269 2018-11-04 23:25:53 and the westindies know that oil is the only way to keep the rich whiteys interested and playing ball with them, basically why trinidad isnt solely dependent on tourist money.

legalization is being pushed by the islands that are at the mercy of tourists
270 2018-11-04 23:25:33 You dressed up, full stop.

Pajamas were for home, spandex was for the gym.

Everything was made of cotton.

You planned outings or you’d be lost.

Coal was safe and oil was cheap.

Life expectancy was 65.

Cars killed almost everyone.
271 2018-11-04 23:25:30 I come home and my dad right away puts gas in my car  first of all it needs an oil change too
272 2018-11-04 23:25:29 Okay i got some oil too
273 2018-11-04 23:25:28 Oh nooooooooooo!!! I luv Dawn & it helps wildlife too!  Its used to wash little marine mammals & birds that are oil spill victims.  Damn. 
274 2018-11-04 23:25:02 It’s an incredibly gorgeous place ! Unfortunately when oil families were transferred to Alaska, they wanted a place more similar to 48 other states and they had the clout SO we started seeing stuff like “gated communities” and “neighborhood associations“: just like New Jersey !
275 2018-11-04 23:24:49 That's what Venezuelan Oil does... buy every vote they can get with Petrodollars...
276 2018-11-04 23:24:33 So the recent double amputee I helped is getting good results with CBD oil without THC and his doctor still won’t give him a prescription.   The ignorance (and or fear) is astounding.   #ACMPR #cannabis

282 2018-11-04 23:23:46 ISEd. Best PD balanced truth about AB industry takes open minds. Educators we have a role to seek truth about the reclamation& processes AB Oil  Gas & Mining sec. is doing to offset human energy needs get the facts.  @TerraceRidgeSch @Suncor @WCPS72 @OilGasCanada @JaneGoodallCAN
283 2018-11-04 23:23:43 Its not like he lost it fighting enemies invading America, he lost it invading some poor country who had oil or something else the Americans wanted.  Taking in account that most wars Americans started where illegal according to international laws you can't  really call him a hero

288 2018-11-04 23:22:49 Queen what kind of industry is this? I’m trying to move CBD oil but can’t get any traction.
289 2018-11-04 23:22:31 got an oil change on my 2 quads today. All I need now are the tags and we on. Just in time for off-roading season 
290 2018-11-04 23:22:28 Oil is basically a drug for the rich... 
291 2018-11-04 23:22:22 Got ng, lpg and oil . Living in Anglesey North Wales having all 3 secures enough work and might struggle with out either one of them. This area is full of caravans so i’ve also got the lpg leisure ticket it’s a head aick and cost to have them all but well worth it
292 2018-11-04 23:22:04 No shit, so there I was; just me and a country, balls deep in motor oil....
293 2018-11-04 23:21:31 Suede will generally look better but if you’re getting them explicitly for winter, leather is your best bet. Make sure to get genuine leather and some mink oil for waterproofing and general upkeep
294 2018-11-04 23:21:26  love it!! I do that when I get on the bus with earphones. Ehmmm okay skincare wise for treats you’d never buy yourself kiehls midnight cleansing oil + midnight concentrate + creamy avocado eye cream + turmeric and cranberry mask
295 2018-11-04 23:21:25 1. The USA has set Sunday November 4 as the last day that the nations of the world have permission to buy oil from Iran.

2. Russia, China and India announced that they will continue buying Iranian oil despite US threats.
296 2018-11-04 23:21:23 Love you too Pann, i thought the squeaky wheel would get the oil on that one. Enjoy!

300 2018-11-04 23:21:05 They are no seeums. Put vanilla mixed with coconut oil on before you go out.
301 2018-11-04 23:20:32 少し揺れましたΣ(O_Oil!)
302 2018-11-04 23:20:22 COOKING TIP: Before placing homemade pizza into the oven, sprinkle with some extra virgin olive oil for a silkier taste and lush texture.
303 2018-11-04 23:20:14 LOVE me some Kraft Mac n Cheese (don't judge) - topped with crispy chicken strips and spaghetti sauce.. yum! - Also, Italian tomato in herbs & olive oil, Mix it with cream cheese & eat it on Pita Chips.. dinner!

305 2018-11-04 23:19:58 Somebody needs to rest her soul( grin) ...Actually and surprisingly she wasn’t a bad governor - she really DID take the oil companies to task for Alaskans - and she WON !  Just not the same scale ..... what an appalling choice for McCain .

307 2018-11-04 23:19:11 Kenney is just an oil lobbyist! He doesn’t care about anything else.
308 2018-11-04 23:19:03 Once a pore becomes clogged, it traps skin oil inside. Bacteria grows in this oil and can cause an inflammatory response in the skin.

311 2018-11-04 23:18:55 Why do I feel like some of the ceasefire agreements from KSA are going to be: "You have to let us drill for oil on your coastline, Yemen. In fact, let us have most of it."
312 2018-11-04 23:18:52 I thought the US had enough oil to be self sufficient. No?
313 2018-11-04 23:18:30 Honestly that's me trying to get the oil in the holes because I refuse to pay for a funnel
314 2018-11-04 23:18:28 SO WE FIND OUT THE 'REAL' REASON TRUMP PUT THE SANCTIONS ON IRANS OIL----SO SAUDI---THE MURDERERS--COULD STEP IN AND FILL THE GAP?  INSTIGATED BY TRUMP AND KUSHNER AND SAUDI---ALL MURDERERS?
315 2018-11-04 23:18:27 Que distinto aqui en RD donde todos viajan en helicóptero por primera vez se sintieron c oil o pobres...
316 2018-11-04 23:18:26 When deciding to spud (start) an oil well? Lots goes into it, but a lot of it is called "animal spirits" or just an informed WAG. Of course, it is based on data that is available about the well site.
317 2018-11-04 23:17:59 @TheDemocrats money can buy many snakes  but we all know they selling nothing but snake oil.
318 2018-11-04 23:17:57 I spent $75 just for an oil change .. whewwww Lexyyy Wya? 
319 2018-11-04 23:17:54 soap takde fragrance jugak. wangi tu dari essential oil bukan fragrance 
320 2018-11-04 23:17:49 hey siri, which essential oil cures existential dread?
321 2018-11-04 23:17:49 Nasa point na ko ng buhay na canola oil na lang yung gusto kong ipahid sa painting ko
322 2018-11-04 23:17:46 I'm eating a bag of snack-size Italian Bruschetta Toasts with olive oil baked in Italy. This won't spoil my supper will it? 
323 2018-11-04 23:17:38 I mixed low sodium soy sauce, sesame oil, and siracha :)
324 2018-11-04 23:17:26 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
325 2018-11-04 23:17:14 My beard sprays all contain coconut oil as the main base. Then an essential oil and a other kind of oil depending what the spray is used for. I have a moisturizing spray, one for hair growth, one for the itching and a conditioning spray.
326 2018-11-04 23:17:13 Yes I just added som bok choy, pepper flakes, and sesame oil to some instant ramen yes it’s fire yes I’m depressed
327 2018-11-04 23:17:12 Are you talking about Man City before the dirty oil money?
328 2018-11-04 23:17:11 Our major industry is collapsing under your watch Premier Notley. If you have a plan to fix broken oil & gas business it will need to be invoked immediately & result in re-establishing confidence & bringing back investment. Ndp & lib politics have set the industry back 5 years.
329 2018-11-04 23:17:06 I don't know if you've ever seen those oil paintings of goat-demons screaming in the 1400s. They're horrific. But they look TAME when compared to a field hockey player roaring "MY ANACONDA DON'T WANT NONE UNLESS YOU GOT BUNS, HON"
330 2018-11-04 23:17:01 Which is exactly what Trump did... mock a handicapped war hero. Like I tweeted, it’s wrong to do that regardless of whether it’s a comedian (who suffered the loss of his dad on 9/11) or the President of the United States.
331 2018-11-04 23:17:00 #alexanderbruz
Heading to the great state of Texas! Under republican leadership and mostly thanks to #realDonaldTrump, They are the worlds third largest producer of oil: 1. USA 2. Russia 3. Texas 4. Obama’s favorite country, Iran God bless Texas!
332 2018-11-04 23:16:59 You should smell that grease at 5:00am in the morning! DISGUSTING!  There is one across the street where I walk in the morning.  That is the nastiest smell.  Don't care for processed fried in oil/grease food.  Don't care for Christian hypocrisy either.
333 2018-11-04 23:16:47 Also don’t ever try to put coconut oil in iced coffee. Rookie mistake
334 2018-11-04 23:16:38 That can be said about many industries, auto, tech, many huge industries/companies pay effectively little or zero tax, or get incentives, kickbacks, tax loopholes, it isn't just oil, how much tax is Amazon paying, Google, Ford, GM?
335 2018-11-04 23:16:30 There’s a witch in Norway called Juanita. She enjoys oil painting and feasting on mushroom soup.
336 2018-11-04 23:16:28 If there was ever a good reason to find an alternative to oil then #maidinhell just illustrated it perfectly!
337 2018-11-04 23:16:26 こっくんおはよう(*´ヮ`)ﾉ

340 2018-11-04 23:16:01 Check your Engine oil this weekend.
341 2018-11-04 23:15:48 You don't like that then never slide to Dubai. Vegas is mild in comparison to that oil money.
342 2018-11-04 23:15:27 Trump is building offshore oil rigs, tar sand oil is terrible quality, we need to move off of oil, it's not sustainable. We have minerals that we can mine that will make us the second biggest economy for renewables on the planet.
343 2018-11-04 23:15:26 Meal prep done, face mask on, coconut oil in hair = a peaceful Sunday and a happy kat
344 2018-11-04 23:15:14 This looting tag is conjecture and just laughable. All the looting going on today in the oil industry with subsidy yet you have the temerity to call others looters. End the hypocrisy pls
345 2018-11-04 23:15:12 Fam, just be real with Jesus man. THESE EDGES NEED TO GROW! Nothing too small or big for Him init. Knock and He’ll answer and dem tings. Dash His words to him. apply the castor oil and faith & I’ll look forward to your testimony xox
346 2018-11-04 23:15:05 I just got me a free oil change 
347 2018-11-04 23:15:03 I get that.  Always have.  
Also, realized it something I shouldn't joke about.
Like, I tell lots of 'Paddy & Mickey' jokes, and Cheap Scotsman jokes because I'm Scots/Irish.  But, no other ethnic jokes.
Just how I was raised.
348 2018-11-04 23:15:01 That had got to be the safest thing I've ever seen... shit, if you were close, I would change your oil for you!
349 2018-11-04 23:14:45 I dressed as X-men's Beast once and someone added ghost pepper oil to the pizza we were eating. I am not good with spice at all, ended up crying and sweating all the blue face paint onto my only white dress shirt. Was a fun Halloween.
350 2018-11-04 23:14:40 Alberta oil is terrible quality oil sand oil, Trump is building off shore oil rigs instead, no pipeline is going to save it.
351 2018-11-04 23:14:18 Are you for real? Forget the oil and whisky BS. We’d be eating turnips without the money sent up here. Especially the way the SNP spends it
352 2018-11-04 23:14:15 Ofcourse I oil my body...pervert

355 2018-11-04 23:14:02 The cost of living in that time has gone up considerably and now with Trump the cost of oil  and other essentials have gone up  even more due to the Tariffs he has imposed.
356 2018-11-04 23:13:58 Got an oil change , got my headlight bulb changed , cleaned my car , finished laundry & ironed work clothes for tomorrow. Whew chile adulting.
357 2018-11-04 23:13:32 Apply almond oil around the mouth to keep your lips supple and soften the lines.

363 2018-11-04 23:12:29 If not for Bill Nelson we would have oil wells off our shores - so shut it!
364 2018-11-04 23:12:22 Not worried about your fake club and plastics like you. If Barca got sanctions, can’t imagine a oil money club with no history will escape unscathed for much worse. 
365 2018-11-04 23:12:10 the difference between me and these other bitches is that i KNOW i need an oil change, i just choose not to right now

367 2018-11-04 23:12:01 Golf is on same path as bowling.  The game became too easy for the pros so they had to trick up the alleys with oil to make it interesting.  Now, average Joe and pro aren’t playing the same game. Bifurcation. Result?  People stopped watching the pros and pro game died.
368 2018-11-04 23:11:58 i’ll pull up some olive oil and dunk yo breadstick ass in it

371 2018-11-04 23:11:36 The medicine doctors prescribe while pregnant is worse & have worse side affect than CBD oil or other natural remedies. I’m not saying blow it down at all but, it has helped a lot of women.
372 2018-11-04 23:11:01 I put lavender essential oil on my dog to help deter fleas and now it’s like an added level of relaxation with puppy cuddles

375 2018-11-04 23:10:30 Oh I believe not only the billions to Iran, but arms shipment to the brotherhood or what ever terrorist group. He knew Erdogan son was buying oil from Isis. We all saw that footage. Russia was buying Libya oil with gold.
376 2018-11-04 23:10:22 @InstituteGC You are a corrupt ex MP who lined his own pockets via LIbya oil with then BP  you should have been locked up after your part in so called WMD and not forgetting bankrupting UK

386 2018-11-04 23:08:45 Yep the Republicans are all in on over-fracking & off shore oil drilling minus any regulations.
You wouldn't believe all the subsidies they give big oil, especially when it helps line their own pockets.

397 2018-11-04 23:07:08 Champ took a long time to adjust when we first got him. He’s been on  Prozac and has had some success with CBD oil as well. He needed a lot of space to adjust and mostly got over his aggressive issues. Hope that Finley is able to adjust soon and enjoy being in a great home

400 2018-11-04 23:06:26 From #HorizonKinetics. The U.S. consumes about 20m barrels of oil a day. At roughly $70 a barrel, it costs $1.4 billion a day to pay for the oil, or $511 billion a year.
401 2018-11-04 23:06:24 I only used water and oil for my retwist. It was a success 
402 2018-11-04 23:06:13 When money is at stake true colors are shown. Oil and gas interests are spending millions to defeat CO prop 112 which is a very modest attempt to keep people safe from poison. #VoteBlue #Colorado #Health
403 2018-11-04 23:06:10 Have you tried passion flower? It helps me a lot--that and lavender oil as "Calm Aid." The added bonus is burping lavender.

407 2018-11-04 23:05:33 We are between paying a carbon tax to cleanup the oil mess (due to spineless gov who gave taxpayer $ to wealthy polluters) AND a PC gov that supports big oil companies who will build more oil pipelines.  They will call it JOBS and will poison whatever clean earth remains.

433 2018-11-04 23:01:21 Leave it to @tedcruz to make everyone go to him unlike Beto who went to all 254 counties more than once. No Super PACS! No money from big oil, Wall Street, NRA, pharma, insurance companies etc... If y'all are not worried, why all the lies & millions on ads?

Please give me money!
440 2018-11-04 23:00:20 Oh, hi Ken - how's the oil?
441 2018-11-04 23:00:12 Weird that pregnant women aren't willing to try CBD oil or something for nausea but quick to take the unnatural meds doctors prescribe 
442 2018-11-04 23:00:04 Higher levels of DHA are correlated with improved verbal fluency in older people. A study on healthy young adults suggested that after six months of daily doses of fish oil improved working memory. part of your daily supplement regimen. #HealthyEating #HealthyLiving #Supplements
443 2018-11-04 23:00:02 Incidentally, I find the oil-and-gassey article the OP seems upset about to be of acceptable quality
It could be better (I didn't quite get what the medical/safety argument for the 2500-setback is, beyond "oilbiz are lying scoundrels and all around bad")but otherwise okay article
444 2018-11-04 22:59:58 Spray a lil beard oil on it and make it do what it do
445 2018-11-04 22:59:47 I made myself some baked chicken breast (hehe) for the first time in like 2+ years, and even though it was absuper basic oil & dry herb recipe, it feels so nice to be eating something I cooked myself  #chronicillness #crohns #ankylosingspondylitis #chronicpain
446 2018-11-04 22:59:46 Oil paint has to be handled correctly re. drying times, fat over lean layers etc. Acrylics are more consistent and can be used more freely without the same kind of restrictions. Oil is great but there are rules.
447 2018-11-04 22:59:39 Olive oil overnight with backstrap is hard to beat as long as you actually like the taste of venison.
448 2018-11-04 22:59:33 So I have combination skin and I just tried @GlamLifeGuru makeup tip and I put a drop of the @Smashbox photo finish primer oil in with my foundation and my skin looks sooo much better !!! It blended better and doesn’t look dry but didn’t look oily 
449 2018-11-04 22:59:28 These people are not leaving the ND oil very soon. The reason they are against restructuring/fiscal federalism. Every time oil,oil ,oil .....
450 2018-11-04 22:59:19 Realised BTC volatility is now lower than AAPL (Apple) and Crude Oil @laurashin 
Not far to go until it's on par with most G10 currencies.
451 2018-11-04 22:59:19 Lmao you need a lot of weed to make butter or oil, and it’s a long process to do so. I have neither time or enough weed.
452 2018-11-04 22:59:15 Everywhere oil
453 2018-11-04 22:59:10 Vanessa Bell Armstrong @dr_vbamusic - Oil of God
454 2018-11-04 22:59:10 That's money that pays for unions. That @OilGasCanada revenue seems low. We got 3,839 millions Premiums, fees and licences and 7,606 from federal government so I'm guessing that the oil revenues not as significant as other sources of cash. So odd isn't it?
455 2018-11-04 22:58:58 The  point a lot on the left of the left miss is that there is a tangible difference when dems are in power. Clinton had a plan to convert  all households to renewable energy in 4 years. Instead you've got increased oil drilling, environmental regs stripped etc. Tangible.
456 2018-11-04 22:58:32 The capitalists deceive us into believing that they have rights to land, oil and other concessions.
457 2018-11-04 22:58:26 I have finally found the right combo of products so my face doesn't oil tf up
458 2018-11-04 22:57:45 Maybe you are right. CFR says it has political legitimacy. And, the same as Hamas.

Israeli territorial expansion is their problem and it source of income / revenue is as a rentier state from land and oil. Both Hamas and Hezbollah are against that expansion.
459 2018-11-04 22:57:36 I love robotic oil poffins~!

463 2018-11-04 22:56:28 CEO of largest oil field services in TX said “Cruz’s unpopularity is making him too expensive bankroll.  We need a safer bet as our next advocate”.
464 2018-11-04 22:56:21 Well duh. The easiest explanation will be we are total idiots for still thinking the Silver guy is anything but a modern snake oil salesman
465 2018-11-04 22:56:14 So was Standard Oil the result of government policies?
466 2018-11-04 22:56:12 I’m a sub oil girl. That sounds super good though! I’ll let them know they better get their shit together.
467 2018-11-04 22:55:59 Agora quero ver, eles reclamarem.
Não foi nada.

470 2018-11-04 22:54:55 He was Canadian PM, not AN premier. Doling out tax money to international oil companies instead of investing royalties in Canada should make Harper Persona non grata in AB

I'm up to Pouring Fourth Oil 2, but Abigail is still no where to be seen to trigger Jack's fishing mission.

Also, it doesnt have to be water.

I think canola oil would work pretty well.

Me: “Extra Virgin?”

My Mom: “Just like you.”


478 2018-11-04 22:53:51 I be smelling like buku cooking oil by the time i get off
479 2018-11-04 22:53:44 Even if the ballot has to be 4 pages long I'd prefer every item be a separate vote. Why is offshore oil drilling tied to indoor clean air vaping use? Sheesh.
480 2018-11-04 22:53:38 Manchester. Saints isn’t an oil team
481 2018-11-04 22:53:02 I have so much coconut oil and Vaseline on my face right now, the winter literally hurts my skin

485 2018-11-04 22:52:38 1. We have flat rates for any service and you sign the paperwork BEFORE the work starts

2. "MY half quart of oil". We use 55 gallon drum oil, do you want me to pour it in a paper bag?

3. The bike he bought, we have / had 6 of them in stock
486 2018-11-04 22:51:38 Best oil to try in is beef tallow, duck fat or lard
487 2018-11-04 22:51:25 Most of what we read when we researched the care said salt so thats why we’ve always done it that way.  Then dry it really well and like you, apply oil for storage.
488 2018-11-04 22:51:21 today I sliced my finger, electrocuted myself and then poured boiling hot oil over my feet all within a 10 min period.
489 2018-11-04 22:51:03 Is it antisemitic to say that some climate deniers are paid off by the oil industry? If no, then you accept that it’s not always antisemitic
490 2018-11-04 22:50:56 $31 million spent to oppose I-1631 because Big Oil cannot possibly use that money to adapt their industry towards clean energy. No, that would affect their quarterly bottom line. And they are spending it to persuade/deceive voters in whatever way they can. Ugh. #YesOn1631
491 2018-11-04 22:50:23 ~TAKE CARE OF UR EYELASHES~

Apply coconut oil and castor oil every night!
This will make them stronger and ur eyelashes will grow faster. Curl your eyelashes, this will make ur eyes look bigger.  ADVICE: don’t do this very often because it could make them weaker
492 2018-11-04 22:50:20 Surely the point of the complaints is not intrinsically about Marr - more about the editorial decision to give Banks an unfettered platform to defend himself .
Difficult for any interviewer to get completely to grips with the subject and pin the snake oil salesman down
493 2018-11-04 22:50:05 i put too much coconut oil in my hair so its been dripping down my neck all shift im miserable

496 2018-11-04 22:49:28 I don't know what kinda bible you are reading & from what kingdom you got it but the bible we read in this earth now...

499 2018-11-04 22:48:58 Awww, come on Nate, it's so simple maybe you need a refresher course. It's all ball bearings nowadays. Now you prepare that Fetzer valve with some 3-in-1 oil and some gauze pads, and I'm gonna need 'bout ten quarts of anti-freeze, preferably Prestone. No, make that Quaker State.

507 2018-11-04 22:47:26 Yes this is exactly it! I totally agree with this approach. That’s why I’m curious why it’s good for the goose (oil market) but not the gander (elections). Refer to original tweet/question.
508 2018-11-04 22:47:21 Wow, I love the values!  Was this done with oil paint? :0
509 2018-11-04 22:47:17 Fry them up with olive oil and left over gravy.
510 2018-11-04 22:47:09 Went to some crafty type thing today. Local olive oil company was there. They put lemon olive oil and persian lime balsamic vinegar on ice cream. Holy shit. I wanted an entire bowl of that stuff. It was so good
511 2018-11-04 22:47:01 Luke oil should start selling single juul pods 
512 2018-11-04 22:47:00 @debbieflintqvc I adore L'Occitane. The hand cream saves my hands from dryness and cracking especially in the winter months. I also bathe my 5 month old in Almond Oil and she smells amazing all day long 
513 2018-11-04 22:46:59 Well then me thinks you protested too much. 

Everyone supports the adaptation and diversification.  Not everyone makes getting their way on their ideas for adaptation or diversification a condition of supporting Alberta Oil & Gas.
514 2018-11-04 22:46:41 why does anybody live up there? was there ever oil in that area?

526 2018-11-04 22:45:38 From Monday the US sanction against Iranian oil goes into effect. For the first 180 days the money for the oil has to go into an escrow account to make sure Iran doesnt get any hard currency.  India will buy oil with rupees which is not a hard currency. Cant buy after 180 days.

531 2018-11-04 22:44:59 Finally watching Taleb's Bloomberg appearance and he's talking like a ZH commenter. 

Calls US national debt a ponzi scheme. Says social security is a "hidden liability". 

Says that the Chinese and oil producing countries might be not around to buy US debt.

This is so bad.

543 2018-11-04 22:43:47 Make no mistake: you served in the interests of oil companies and the military industrial complex. My freedoms never were on the line. Stop believing everything they tell you in boot camp. Go back to school and study American foreign policy.
544 2018-11-04 22:43:31 They are brainless.
They have no idea of the work, the complexity or miles crossed to bring fuel to their fingertips.
Nor do they understand how arduous life would be without oil and gas. 
I'd like them to find out.
545 2018-11-04 22:43:25 Can I twist your oil cap?
546 2018-11-04 22:43:20 Vote no on 112 because gas/oil is more important than kids.
547 2018-11-04 22:43:05 War is so fucking lame. I have no respect for someone who CHOOSES to contribute to senseless killings and the war on oil. You’re not special or honorable. There hasn’t been a war worth fighting since WW2 and that’s the truth.

553 2018-11-04 22:41:57 Oil and gas prices are at their highest in four years. Energy costs will increase 10-15% over last year. Food costs are increasing weekly. Medical insurance continues to rise annually. Prescription medication increases continue in all parts of the Country. What about the deficit?
554 2018-11-04 22:41:33 you could feed Pete some lemon drizzle cake. 
555 2018-11-04 22:41:32 We were using some fancy expensive “Stainless Steel cleaner” Then one day I googled alternative (aka cheaper) methods and voila, baby oil. Works like a charm.

558 2018-11-04 22:40:29 The big question is #healthcare vs #healthinsurance. If u buy a car u can pay 2cover everything. Tires, oil change etc. but car insurance is 2cover a crash. Why should health insurance be any different? #Trump #Republicans
559 2018-11-04 22:40:08 But like, you tweet out oil market news all the time? (Which is great btw) So why bother? Just wait for API/EIA/IEA everything else is irrelevant
560 2018-11-04 22:40:06 ん、これ油変えた？あーなるほど、ごま油をひまわり油で割ったのか。
561 2018-11-04 22:40:00 There are no sanctions on Venezuelan oil, at least not on this planet. Instead the US bankrolls the regime by buying most of its oil

565 2018-11-04 22:39:01 These people have abandoned all decency.
566 2018-11-04 22:38:50 You get paid for the job you do and the responsibility you take on...jobs aren’t equal so pay rates are set by risk and responsibility Don’t expect to get the same pay as an oil rig worker if your working in the yarn shop Not man vs woman It’s job vs job
567 2018-11-04 22:38:28 Sounds like you’ve created a House un-Albertan Activities Committee. Anyone who doesn’t agree with your version of the world is “anti-oil.” But, the future of oil and gas lies in adaptation, not denial. Dinosaurs like you are the real enemies of the sector, not me. #ableg #abpoli
568 2018-11-04 22:38:19 Just FYI, Also the first ship of oil sold from the US in 50 yrs came from that area. 

LNG terminal under construction there also.
569 2018-11-04 22:38:16 Isn’t this like saying following news on the oil market is useless, wait for the actual data?

571 2018-11-04 22:37:59 What vitamins are you taking ? If your not you should start taking fish oil and look up evening primrose oil I used to have the most painful periods and now I don’t !
572 2018-11-04 22:37:55 Underrated:  salad with olive oil & lemon/pomegranate syrup dressing, in a wrap
573 2018-11-04 22:37:53 Lol most foriegn cars are around that. My service A oil changes are close to 300.

I couldn't even imagine what a rolls oil change would cost
574 2018-11-04 22:37:49 Oh I forgot, about 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Works withoutbut better with.

578 2018-11-04 22:37:26 “If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan” ~Barack Obama 6/6/2009 You think I believe anything that Snake Oil Salesman has to say ever?? Nope he is a liar and did more damage to this country then you libs care to admit!
579 2018-11-04 22:37:19 Too bad for that.  More vets have a clear head about war.  Not so eager to jump into them.   POTUS surrounds himself with generals for a reason.  Not gung ho corporate shills who use our kids for oil wars.
580 2018-11-04 22:37:17 Noooo
581 2018-11-04 22:36:27 I blocked that idiot a long time ago. For the record, I talked to AER, environment + energy ministers' offices, read a CD Howe study, interviewed one of the co-authors, talked to Lars De Pauw (who didn't want to be interviewed again after NO got done with him), etc. No oil cos

583 2018-11-04 22:36:02 ~TAKE CARE OF YOUR EYEBROWS~

Wax your eyebrows! This will define your eyes and ur face, apply coconut oil or castor oil every night. This will help ur eyebrow’s hair to grow way thicker and faster
584 2018-11-04 22:35:57 Thanks for the input! Now I’m just looking for some specific points that you might disagree with? Or is it just insults for tonight? I’m not in the media, I’m on an oil rig.
585 2018-11-04 22:35:40 Wow once you use coconut oil as lube it really ruins it for cooking purposes...Is something someone might say who has had that experience.

587 2018-11-04 22:35:30 You should really think about combating “snake oil” salespeople and “mlm” anti-vax talk.  I respect your real talk and it’s fluttering with poetry about developing eyes, spines & the rib cage, and I think if we could use your voice to remind people, Lemon juice isn’t medicine.
588 2018-11-04 22:35:05 US produces enough oil & in fact exporting oil to other countries. What will the Saudi’s do when u run out of oil? US is yr protector. Don’t forget that.
589 2018-11-04 22:34:55 Here a fact. I enlisted as a medic in the US army because I wanted to help people. I never fought for oil or defense contractors. I love this country and I would gladly volunteer again to help others, I may disagree with political opinions but mocking vets wounds is wrong.

595 2018-11-04 22:34:00 Colorado Voters: China's Unipec is about to begin a large purchase of crude oil from the US. All the more reason to vote no on prop 112.
596 2018-11-04 22:33:53 He has directly contradicted himself and we are no clearer as to where the money came from because we have only his onflicting words.

Evidence will show this candidate was perfectly suited to Leave. Just like Farage and BoJo.

All snake oil salesmen.
597 2018-11-04 22:33:29 Adaptation is part of survival. For not just workers but industry.  Remember MySpace? Remember oil lamps?
598 2018-11-04 22:33:28 I love the smell of garlic and onions sizzling in olive oil 
599 2018-11-04 22:32:49 Youse would snatch that oil money up in a flash in this day an age
600 2018-11-04 22:32:42 Additionally you’re thinking too short term even in terms of energy usage. Check out the exponential growth curve solar has been on for decades. The world will not be on oil in 20 years
601 2018-11-04 22:32:41 Are you saying you use nothing derived from oil or other hydrocarbons?
602 2018-11-04 22:32:35 Alhamdulillah...
603 2018-11-04 22:32:34 I wish I was holding some Oil Prices, so that I could Drop them on Monday

606 2018-11-04 22:32:18 I've never smoked it (I know, hard to believe), but I'm REALLY down with CBD oil. After suffering with lupus (unknowingly) for years, I feel AMAZING now :) Double doses on Tuesday!
607 2018-11-04 22:32:16 @AYELEANDCO quick question - I double cleanse in my skincare routine. Besides your oil cleanser, which of your other cleansers would you suggest as a second cleanser?
608 2018-11-04 22:32:03 -water

-use good face masks 

-get 8+ hours of sleep

-facial oil

-natural(no makeup)

-drink green tea

Here’s what’s funny, the oil company doesn’t have to be there because they own the land and permits already. They r there in a effort to ...
611 2018-11-04 22:31:50 walked into the new goop store, put two drops of $300 oil on my face and immediately started benjamin button-ing
612 2018-11-04 22:31:31 I agree, teak oil.
613 2018-11-04 22:31:21 I wonder where they are going to stay. Camp out? Motel rooms are scarce and expensive. Oil and gas people have taken over most of the rooms in West Texas, I know. Can they afford $450 rooms a day, not counting food? Gas is high in Texas also.

619 2018-11-04 22:29:51 "Wade!"

Hands were placed onto her hips. Now she was wearing her serious face, the one with the raised eyebrows, both of them. That meant it was really serious.

620 2018-11-04 22:29:47 the trick is the get them really small and fry them in chili oil, right @thomas_coseinc?

Gov Abbott defended Texas against obama who did not want the oil business
622 2018-11-04 22:29:26 We can borrow some of his oil when we are down in New Orleans

624 2018-11-04 22:29:07 Iran again amigo

They arm the Houthis in a play to control the Bab al Mandeb strait & the flow of oil out of the region

The Saudis are fighting to stop that in the interest of everyone who uses energy

Oh
Sorry I got all factual & interrupted your ill-informed demagoguery
625 2018-11-04 22:27:59 When y’all lil girls have Afros can y’all moisturize it? Spray a lil oil sheen? Pick it out? Swoop the front? 
626 2018-11-04 22:27:36 @grav3yardgirl Hey Bunny, I know you’re allergic to tea tree oil, and I think I just found out I am too. What do you use to help your skin if you used something with tea tree oil in it?
627 2018-11-04 22:27:30 For years people were lied to by the oil industry, & told that burning oil was unrelated to global warming, so most vehicles sold in the US & on the road run on fossil fuels.

If people could afford a new electric car, or afford converting their old car to electric, they would.

630 2018-11-04 22:26:43 why not just rub off the oil!!!
631 2018-11-04 22:26:42 “Facts” and Dinesh are oil and water. You have to shake them really hard to live together in an emulsion and the second you stop shaking, they’ll separate at the first chance.

633 2018-11-04 22:26:20 I have been trying to get rid of my chapped ass lips for like 4 days now. I've been using hella chapstick and coconut oil and these shits are still chapped. Help.
634 2018-11-04 22:26:20 I was so hurt when I first saw one. I been putting bio oil and all kind of shit too. It’s just genetics  thankfully they’re all hella low like little ones all under my belly button, so I might be okay 
635 2018-11-04 22:26:12 Andrew Scheer would have sold out everything except for the oil.
636 2018-11-04 22:26:10 I've only ever clened/wiped the cast iron Dutch oven and pan then seasoned with olive oil (wiped excess) and put them away
637 2018-11-04 22:26:05 Also I’m 99% positive that i just found out that I’m allergic to tea tree oil so if anyone has remedies hit me up because my face is bright red. I took the face mask off before the time was up cause something didn’t feel right, but it wasn’t burning or anything.
638 2018-11-04 22:25:56 Aw shucks, forgot about the big oil hardship waivers killing the ethanol market and the tariffs killing our soybean market guess I will take it for the team, just hate the thought of Big Oils profits being hurt.

641 2018-11-04 22:25:45 i bought a bottle of lavender essential oil if it doesnt cure my insomnia im gonna kill myself
642 2018-11-04 22:25:43 I can attest to it going 10 times higher and we get ours through a top ten oil company. Ty democrats for as usually stealing the fruits of others labor to redistribute it for votes.
643 2018-11-04 22:25:14 You can do it, man! CBD oil is actually really nice, you just have to give it a chance. Really helps relax you and helps with anxiety also.
644 2018-11-04 22:25:10 Absolutely.  Government by the people and for the people. Not for Big Government and Big Oil and Corrupt Oligarchs

647 2018-11-04 22:24:53 Yes 13trillion naira, was borrowed to finance over 200  infrastructural project abandoned by the previous admin, which the previous admin could have completed when the crude price boom in oil market.
648 2018-11-04 22:24:50 Eat one that’s soaked in oil, just immediately it’s out of the Pan.. Make sure it burns your tongue very well ok..
649 2018-11-04 22:24:41 1. Tea Tree Oil                                           Helps fight bacteria and reduces skin inflammation. Also fights epidermidis, a type of bacteria that causes pimples; which is great for getting rid of acne.           TIP:dilute the oil with water or it can case irritation

653 2018-11-04 22:24:19 Weird cause we were told 15-20 years ago that the upcoming ice age was going to kill us. Yet we are still here. Any other snake oil out there to peddle?
654 2018-11-04 22:24:06 Always remember to oil the steak and not the foot
655 2018-11-04 22:24:03 Its just bad policy; Colorado has some of the best oil and gas regulations in the country -- this is a de facto ban!
656 2018-11-04 22:24:01 I don’t remember what temperature we cook them at but Husbandchef usually fried them in oil with a lid on, then adds a bit of water once they’re mostly cooks and steams them that way.
657 2018-11-04 22:23:58 Saudi does, Iran & Iraq also, I know there’s oil fields in Pakistan but I don’t think we’re relying on them to meet our needs 
Either way these cunts are living in the 12th century, I’d just leave them to get fucking on with it if they canny gie themselves a shake

660 2018-11-04 22:23:21 It’s just a physically easier option for most, less toxic, fewer side effects, easier withdrawal. 

Some people don’t handle CBD oil well. I don’t. I swell up. 

But we know very little about it yet.

691 2018-11-04 22:19:38 i'm concerned that energy transition is a euphemism. what is called for is the destruction of oil companies. whether capitalism chooses to rebuild or not is second order.
692 2018-11-04 22:19:11 This prime ribeye came out amazing!
Seared on the flat grill with olive oil and then baked in the grill for a while... so good!
693 2018-11-04 22:19:10 The best fuel for delivering your burgers? Our cooking oil of course! #mcrecycle
694 2018-11-04 22:18:59 Our Nation is the 2nd largest producer of Crude Oil on the globe. WHY isn't the price of gas at the pump lowering? Are the powers that be, looking at the same conclusion I am? The gas & oil lobby, is truly in the pockets of our representatives. SAD

699 2018-11-04 22:18:35 Husbands always seem to go out of their way to justify their presence, and validate their masculinity, when they are with their wives shopping in my fragrance store. They ask for scents like motor oil or deer piss or beer or charcoal briquettes- but this one topped it:
700 2018-11-04 22:18:18 Crude oil accounts for 95% of Nigeria's foreign exports.
701 2018-11-04 22:18:13 The fuck kinda oil?
702 2018-11-04 22:17:57 Wish I had someone to oil my scalp and locs lol ..I need that type of therapy right now.
703 2018-11-04 22:17:56 This is not the same, but I have to squeeze fish oil pills into my cat's food (she used to eat them whole and then decided that was too easy on me) and I literally had to buy medical gloves to stop my hands from smelling permanently.
704 2018-11-04 22:17:54 I just used to use a bit of hair oil on it and plait it before bed! They’re so easy to look after, then just get it refitted every 10-12 weeks or so I’d say but depends how fast your hair grows!

712 2018-11-04 22:16:45 They have lots of oil.
713 2018-11-04 22:16:41 @HaydnSchneider so I saw you post about the black label CBD oil with THC that’s releasing soon, but I’m curious- what’ll be the difference between the two? Besides obviously the THC amount present. If that makes sense??? Lol
714 2018-11-04 22:16:33 No oil checking allowed.

717 2018-11-04 22:15:56 I love it when lefties look down their nose at people without a bachelors degree, but then have no clue how to change their own oil, fix a clogged sink, or follow a damn recipe in a cookbook.

724 2018-11-04 22:15:24 Yeah. A blessing and a curse. Wish I would have used CBD oil from the get go, when I recently needed pain meds.
725 2018-11-04 22:15:20 When Josh Hawley gets his money from the likes of the Senate Leadership Fund & OneNation (I.e. Sheldon Adelson, the Koch brothers & an assortment of oil companies) you know who he’ll be working for & it’s not us.

729 2018-11-04 22:14:49 Interestingly, the then GMD/CEO of the NNPC, Dr Kachukwu Ibe, a global oil and gas expert, who rose to the topmost level at Exxon Mobil, in late 2015  queried the authenticity, veracity and credibility of the 28million-39m litres per day consumption under Deziani and Yakubu .

735 2018-11-04 22:13:47 Nobody is trying to prevent electrification. The ambition is to make it clean, cheap and fast to occur. Only renewable energy can tick all three boxes. Fossil fuels are done. Coal is dead, gas and oil are too expensive. The future is solar and batteries w some wind and hydro

742 2018-11-04 22:12:27 Simon, I am wondering, when you see animal cruelty such as the camel, blindfolded and worked in a continuous circle to make olive oil, do you get involved to try and save them from a life of misery? I have seen a few animals treated badly in a few of your series’s... 
743 2018-11-04 22:12:20 My man paid $280 for an oil change. What the fuck lmao.

Stop treating Trumps lies as reality.
751 2018-11-04 22:11:08 Oh, please tell us some more fake news about oil prices rising to unbearable costs because of sanctions put on the Virgin Islands by France. YES THIS IS FAKE NEWS. Just wanted to get some laughs here. And show just how the clinton news network works
752 2018-11-04 22:11:05 It's an oil that you rub on your face to clean it instead of soap.
753 2018-11-04 22:11:01 Mobil did not discover oil in Muzarabani. No oil well was ever drilled. They classified it as more of a natural gas prospect than an oil prospect. Most oil wells in the world were sunk long back using that same technology available that time. The area remain a prospect.

Rose water can get rid of acne. It is a great cleanser and aids in removing oil and dirt accumulated in clogged pores

Rose water has anti-inflammatory properties that can help reduce the redness of irritated skin.

Rose water is capable of sealing up a small wound such as a cut or burn faster, apply a little to the cut and it should heal faster

- Oily hair:
Rose water controls excess oil. Try buy shampoos that contain rose water

While I think binge eating is important, as a medically fragile person (cancer + MS), I feel that sm has really taken over. I weary of people telling me how I can be cured with X & worry about people less savvy choosing to take CBD oil over seeing an oncologist.

792 2018-11-04 22:05:48 Please go visit Illinois and see how much fossil fuels go into growing corn. NPK fertilizer starts as oil nowhere near Illinois, is processed somewhere else then shipped and spread. In rainy years seed is planted by helicopter.
793 2018-11-04 22:05:47 That's rather uncalled for pal. By killing an industry like oil&gas with high paying jobs, it is people like YOU are the enemy of labour.

807 2018-11-04 22:04:06 Also, use of electricity from dirty coal... Id still argue that it's comparable to how dirty drilling for oil is.  Benefit is that there's potential to clean up by changing how electricity is produced (Solar, Wind, hydro...)
808 2018-11-04 22:04:05 Amazon sells CBD oil? Is it any less expensive than buying it from companies that manufacture it?

I stopped eating chicken as much because I kept overcomplicating it.
846 2018-11-04 21:59:24 Water, oil & chicken?? Loool
847 2018-11-04 21:59:12 Agree mate. We can’t give up. But we need a degree of success this year. I’d say 90+ points is rather successful. Not our fault corrupt oil money has bought one of the strongest squads in football.
848 2018-11-04 21:59:00 I took my mom to a fall festival and getting her through the MLM booths was hell. If you make eye contact with these women you’re GOING to end up with essential oil or a purse.
849 2018-11-04 21:58:55 Comparison of mnfting li-ion bttry should be compared to drilling for crude, transport to refineries, refining it, & distribution it throughout the world.

Mnftng for li-ion for 1 car happens once for the life of the car. Oil/gas production happens for life of the car
850 2018-11-04 21:58:46 Dreaming!来そう(Ｎ回目)
851 2018-11-04 21:58:32 I live in Colorado and I voted for 112. We don't need these gas and oil wells so close to homes.
852 2018-11-04 21:58:28 What about CBD oil to help calm the anxiety? If you’re in a state where it’s not available/legal - you might try a dose of Benadryl (just for the short term!) to keep you off the cigarettes.
853 2018-11-04 21:58:25 The ratio says it all
854 2018-11-04 21:58:16 It’s ok Khalid. They are going for the oil in Venezuela. Maybe they’ll forget the Middle East and bring the war to their own backyard.
855 2018-11-04 21:58:09 Fuck the UEFA. Fuck the FIFA. Fuck the oil loving cunts

Good evening 
856 2018-11-04 21:58:05 Yeah without FANG to lead higher and oil weak I am obviously grasping for possible leadership lol
857 2018-11-04 21:57:58 Are you rubbing but mayor or azur g.nut oil?
858 2018-11-04 21:57:56 Almond or jojoba oil.
859 2018-11-04 21:57:49 Are you aware of the "free market" dairy glut in the world, aid and abetted by foreign taxpayer subsidies?  The "free market" also hits consumers again with higher retail prices than here in Canada.  CDN dairy is taxpayer subsidy free unlike your "free market" Alberta oil.
860 2018-11-04 21:57:43 More then likely it was some grease or oil from the mechanic's hands that got onto the new manifolds when he was replacing them. Also could be some sort of liquid anti-sieze spray that was used to remove the manifold bolts from the studs and got onto the block. Should be fine.
861 2018-11-04 21:57:31 Tahini is delicious, and I enjoy toasted sesame oil as a finishing touch for stirfries. Fabulous flavor, and yes, a little goes a long way.
862 2018-11-04 21:57:31 This year I’m gone buy me some more & i promise not to get oil on them
863 2018-11-04 21:57:25 I recommend almond oil over coconut oil but whatever works for you.
864 2018-11-04 21:57:23 That be oil all over your face 
865 2018-11-04 21:56:54 Dad: did you check the oil in your car 
Me: well I thought you’ve been doing that
Dad: omg..
866 2018-11-04 21:56:48 When I was a kid we used to have castor oil ... it's not new.
867 2018-11-04 21:56:46 Don't get your hopes up too much, US sanctions will not be as tough as once thought. Special exceptions concerning oil purchased from Iran have been granted. For instance India, China, etc...
868 2018-11-04 21:56:23 Thinking about ordering perfume oils and mixing my own formula. I know the ingredients in my favorites, just have no idea about the proportions. That’s the art of it. The precise amounts of each oil.
869 2018-11-04 21:56:18 yea, like oil
870 2018-11-04 21:56:13 I think all my uggs had oil stains on them 
871 2018-11-04 21:56:00 There was that time they "forgot" to collect around 14 billion in oil royatlies.  OR their little skypalce project.
872 2018-11-04 21:55:43 I laugh at the ridiculous mental gymnastics that ties veterans fighting wars abroad, to the country’s independence being at risk for a setback for multi billionaire multinational oil corporations wanting to exploit Coloradoan’s lands

878 2018-11-04 21:54:40 Oil is made from our raw sewage or Doo Doo and bodily fluids and sold back to us to power vehicles, cause where else does it all go?Then they use fake stage props such as Oil Rigs (very few) to make us think they are drilling into earth to confuse us, into buying back our wastes.

882 2018-11-04 21:54:26 More sideshows, just like the discovery of oil that wasn't
883 2018-11-04 21:54:24 Yes,  exactly Kyle ....  Thats the plan...  I have turned it around several times already and believe it will happen again...   I certainly do love providing doctors wrong and showing them the power of cannabis oil ...
884 2018-11-04 21:54:11 But I used my ground coffee to make a face scrub with coconut oil, can you do that?
885 2018-11-04 21:54:09 Somebody forgot to oil the stairs.

891 2018-11-04 21:52:38 This election, let's thank soda companies and big oil for spending so much money in our media markets this election season.
892 2018-11-04 21:52:35 He is determined to remove Canada's dependence on foreign oil. He had said many times that he will support the energy sector and make Canada's economy grow WHILE protecting the environment from abuses. That means pipelines.
893 2018-11-04 21:52:29 You’d be amazed at how olive oil, sugar, & honey makes your feet feel
894 2018-11-04 21:52:25 They called it "checking your oil" during wrestling in school. I don't see a problem with it 
895 2018-11-04 21:52:24 Shoutout to rosewater and sweet almond oil for being the real ones.
896 2018-11-04 21:52:20 It would be so easy to fill up my candles with fragrance oil and make more commercial scents like cookie dough or pumpkin spice, but I promise you I'll never do that. They are designed to work aromatically on the body and soul, corresponding to each goddess and intention.

898 2018-11-04 21:51:39 Mineral oil induces throwing up if not take him or her to the vet, just depends on the quantity of how much they ate and what size your dog is
899 2018-11-04 21:51:21 I didn't serve. Never said I did.
I will never empower the war machine.
Destruction of other cultures, countries and civilians for oil and Their resources.
All based on lies, manipulation and fear.
900 2018-11-04 21:50:56 I was just talking about this with someone else, discussing the oil industry in South America, Exxon Mobil, etc.  It's all fucked, my friend.  We can't even trash the tyrants without accepting our own fault in the matter.

902 2018-11-04 21:50:08 I'm tired of getting shamed by oil change places about Lucy the Lexus. I am obviously aware that 260,000 miles is high. She is a senior citizen who doesn't give me any problems, and I will drive her until the end.
903 2018-11-04 21:50:07 Now wondering how hemp seed oil rated
904 2018-11-04 21:49:57 Arsene knew he had to step away from winning titles when Chelsea won the lottery and we had to pay for the stadium. By the time that was done, the world moved on and everybody had resources. Plus the fact we now compete against an oil state which no one can challenge.
905 2018-11-04 21:49:50 Your club is literally being pumped up by oil money.

You can't support a financial group dude...
906 2018-11-04 21:49:30 Possibly... Maybe super slippery with oil(?) and just a bit of momentum sent him flying.

911 2018-11-04 21:49:03 Considering all the other ingredients, maybe a non-issue.  Olive oil is kinda iffy, too.

915 2018-11-04 21:48:38 Most of his voters don’t care if he lies. It’s part of his “charm.”  Trump cons the easily conned.  He’s a fake preacher and a snake oil salesman combined.
916 2018-11-04 21:48:36 No. I am not. Nor most. Things are pretty bleak if this carnival barer, snake oil salesman, con-man gets his way. You should travel, Tomi. Get to know some real people and open your mind. In a few short years, you won’t get by on “trying to be sexy, young echo chamber”anymore.

921 2018-11-04 21:47:38 Fry in moringa oil,! Of course bread them!
922 2018-11-04 21:47:12 Because the US needs jack-all from Zimbabwe, yet needs oil, and has strategic staging bases in those countries you mentioned. We are not Saudi Arabia or Israel shamwari
923 2018-11-04 21:46:56 Yeah but Amanda is a beast, plus has no idea how make-up works. I mean, I’m no oil painting but she was a moose.
924 2018-11-04 21:46:51 You keep telling yourself that, your EV friends will believe you at least. Still pretty wrong though. If EVs weren't still utterly dependent on crude oil byproducts I'd somewhat agree with you. As it is, we need them for plastics, lubricants, fabrics, tyres, roads etc.
925 2018-11-04 21:46:48 Health Tips: keep your omega 3 oils(incl. fish oils)  in the freezer to keep fresh and reduce the fish oil repeating on you.
926 2018-11-04 21:46:36 Ahh that's not dumb!! It does make me happy even if I'm also super stressed  and yeah we love yellow oil and I even made a slightly yellow solid the other day so !!! That really was exciting 
927 2018-11-04 21:46:24 Got the oil changed yesterday and now my brand new car won't start....it's my lucky day. 
928 2018-11-04 21:46:20 But yet some of those small boats get their way to Yemen anyway.. Remember the incident where an oil tanker was hit by an RPG carried on one of those boats .. Saudi needed to suspend oil shipments temporarily until resolving that breach ..
929 2018-11-04 21:46:05 Check your Engine oil today.
930 2018-11-04 21:45:56 I voted for Perot. He told people what they needed to hear, not what they wanted to hear. He went on national television, in the 90s, during an election, and said that we needed to get off foreign oil and raise the gas taxes. He was called crazy. And here we are...
931 2018-11-04 21:45:55 we still let's make a selection to choose the better products because i will go read thing for thing and say still more for while the hask argain oil from morocco and the hask keratin protein .. and the other mask of morocco of argan also of moroccoo..
932 2018-11-04 21:45:53 Totally agree they were used,  but we should never forget them, they deserve our respect. The aristocracy sent these souls to thier death, they still do?? But Instead of land grabs, now it's for oil!!
933 2018-11-04 21:45:44 stay sipping that purple oil
934 2018-11-04 21:45:34 I was self-harming, I tried s-uic-ide many times. I got choked in school being bullied, I got oil in my eyes, I was told so many times slut, whore, attention seeker, I got beaten and bruised til I went mute. I don't want you going down this same path as me. It's fucking horrible.
935 2018-11-04 21:45:30 literally who let me have a car??? i’m 4,000 miles over from when i needed my oil changed, my breaks are making the worst noise i’ve ever heard, i probably need some new tires and i almost run out of gas on a weekly basis

937 2018-11-04 21:45:14 Then season with your favorite Creole seasoning.  Then, add chicken stock and chicken (we use thighs). Bring to boil, then simmer. Skim foam off. Add cooked sausage. Slow cook for hours.

(We often sauté sausage first before making roux, using that oil to make the roux with it.)
938 2018-11-04 21:45:09 My car needs an oil change and possibly other maintenance.

947 2018-11-04 21:43:38 @ctvedmonton @CTVNationalNews @CTVVancouver 
Have you checked this story out? This is the biggest breaking news story of the decade. A concerted, orchestrated effort to landlock Alberta oil, costing Alberta AND Canada $BILLIONS. Looks like Vivian Krause has irrefutable evidence.

949 2018-11-04 21:43:26 Coconut oil is so versatile.
950 2018-11-04 21:42:56 The saphire buisness is probably middle eastern oil barons. While asians and africans stand for something like 90% of all the worlds pollution alot of it is because they export merchandise to Europeans and northern Americans.

963 2018-11-04 21:41:32 They will be badly hopelessly brutally outspent. Have a look at what happened in CA when they put oil royalties on the ballot. CA for crissakes! If the bad guys can throw enough money into a state like CA on an issue like that to win, imagine what they can do for HC across the US

971 2018-11-04 21:40:33 Sunday’s are for self care. Idc what anyone says. On Sundays I do hair masks, face masks, everything. Dripping in coconut oil, drinking gallons of water and praying that my skin acts right, Amen.
972 2018-11-04 21:40:29 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.
973 2018-11-04 21:40:28 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Los Angeles sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

979 2018-11-04 21:40:04 It's not the man, it's the people. The majority of Trump supporters are easily led, deny reality and look for a scapegoat to blame their problems. Trump simply tells them what they want to hear. If it wasn't him, they'd flock to any other snake oil salesman promising a quick fix.
980 2018-11-04 21:39:52 Haaai there’s no better way to put it. Unless you have suggestions. Morals and the minister are water n oil, why high standards for the paper

987 2018-11-04 21:39:15 Cool cool. Just as long as we’re going after all destructive products, including palm oil etc...
988 2018-11-04 21:39:11 Lethbridge capitalizes on a powerplay to make it 2-1
989 2018-11-04 21:39:10 When everything is given to one(agric, oil, minerals, people etc) to be great, one never sees anything; the problem with privilege

Raise your head, look across our borders & see different stories; Rwanda, Ghana, Kenya, Ivory Coast etc & I dare say Liberia may do better too
990 2018-11-04 21:39:10 Only twisted white men coined it "Oil" instead of "Oyel"!
991 2018-11-04 21:38:43 Self care can look like:

• Stepping outside to take 5 minutes to yourself
• Taking a couple of deep breaths
• Relaxing the muscles in your face, butt & shoulders
• Putting your favorite oil blend in the diffuser
• Lighting a candle
• Making a good meal choice
992 2018-11-04 21:37:54 I didn't, but I will on my next order. I plan to get some candles and a face oil.
993 2018-11-04 21:37:52 You don't like oil? ;3

Why in the world aren't you starting off every newscast with this? A concerted effort by foreign actors to keep Alberta oil landlocked??? This is the most important story in at least a decade. #cdnpoli

1003 2018-11-04 21:36:53 How about this one:
Oil City-Hollidaysburg winner gets either East Stroudsburg South or Wallenpaupack. ESS is 278 miles from Oil City, and Wallenpaupack is 299. The Oilers would play one of those teams BEFORE the WPIAL champion.
................yeah six classes has been great!
1004 2018-11-04 21:36:45 What "oil" has America gotten from Iraq and Afghanistan? We have no stakes in any of the wells over there. You need to check China.
1005 2018-11-04 21:36:42 *tar sands oil.

Typo

The oil sands EROI is arguably inflated at 4:1, with subsidies & costs to process the bitumen down the line not included in these evaluations. Some estimates have it at 3:1 or even lower.
1006 2018-11-04 21:36:34 Real Madrid fan since 98, just after they win the Champions League for the 1st time in years. Man City fan since 2008 the year they got the oil money. Fuck off you glory hunting crab.

1015 2018-11-04 21:35:56 Oil has gone up $60 plus a barrel so prices n the market will reflect that. Economy’s booming, unemployment lowest EVER, North Korea “winning”  Democrats take middle class gains & give to lazy lower class

1031 2018-11-04 21:34:08 yes but some other people Like soros might be. Some insurance salesman. Thats their point, is that they may have the kocks and the oil industry on their side, but we have the masses on our side. Their point is that the masses lose because the elite are better
1032 2018-11-04 21:33:48 Yes! The oil used to season the pan polymerizes, producing an impermeable surface, if you do it right.
1033 2018-11-04 21:33:36 Trump attributes ridiculous conspiracies to the opposition as a diversion away from his administration's actual conspiring w/Russia, Saudi Arabia, & NK. What's astonishing is how willing the crowds are to swallow Trump's 'snake oil' w/o a shred of evidence.
1034 2018-11-04 21:33:33 Follow @Simpson_Rick He is known as the first person to spread the information of making cannabis oil to cure cancer to the masses and he has done that for over a decade free of charge to anyone. He is my personal hero that I look up to every day.

1038 2018-11-04 21:32:05 Obama lowered the corporate tax rate from one of the highest in the world to one of the lowest. He also got rid of small business strangling regulations.

1064 2018-11-04 21:29:57 That's why Lamont plans to eliminate business taxes and lower propety taxes?

1077 2018-11-04 21:28:33 don't put the theory off too long though, understanding the fundamentals will save you an enormous amount of time and pain. Otherwise every problem becomes a nail.

There are a lot of cowboys out there selling snake oil.
1078 2018-11-04 21:28:29 Norway is a special case, they have to cut their GHG emissions from cars so they can expand their oil and gas industry and still meet their targets. At least in Norway the power comes from hydro so BEVs do make sense

1082 2018-11-04 21:28:09 It's obvious variations in financial demand for oil & products affects the oil market infinitely more than variations in demand for consumption. The question is what mechanisms & motivations are involved?

1087 2018-11-04 21:27:46 Well I have someone change my oil and oil filter for free, also if my check engine light goes off my car guy thinks I’m cute so he does my diagnostics for free even though it’s supposed to be $100 to cover the year.... then he orders the part and I have someone else do it 
1088 2018-11-04 21:27:38 *seriously. America’s ME foreign policy is most always on the side of Israel, especially since the 80s/90s. America’s ME foreign policy now is basically: a) whatever Israel wants, and b) oil and money for American businesses. Any other considerations are far behind these.

1091 2018-11-04 21:26:56 It isn't meant to be used as a spot tx, it works over the long term (by acting on oil glands if I recall correctly) and will just cause unnecessary irritation w little to no therapeutic effect if used as a spot tx

1093 2018-11-04 21:26:48 We as a society need to stop dependency on oil for motor fuel (almost impossible) and dependency of red meat in our diets in order for this world to exist for our children. If we want any.

1097 2018-11-04 21:26:24 Not really, no. I am not an expert on the matter. What I can do is recommend that if this subject is intresting to you, I'd recomend Peter Zeihans "The Accidental Superpower" which goes into the subject of oil (and why american politics will cease to be shaped by it) .

1113 2018-11-04 21:24:42 Then why does a Nobel Laureate in economics agree with this. Thinking our industries will be at a disadvantage implies that Canadian industries are too weak and feeble to focus their spending towards low GHG innovation, besides. The oil industry is already obscenely profitable
1114 2018-11-04 21:24:30 Their response of "lighten up Francis" would hold a little more weight if they weren't the same group of people that would riot in the streets over who wore what Halloween costumes

1126 2018-11-04 21:23:19 Dog, I don’t CARE about his snake oil, what I care about is ensuring free though remains in classrooms, and students of all politics fell safe and welcome, I get that you just wanna “win” but that’s not what I’m about. Move along if u got nothing else to say
1127 2018-11-04 21:23:09 I always pop on drops of lavender essential oil on mine before I slip in
1128 2018-11-04 21:23:01 Use a little olive oil on the end of a Q-tip to remove eyeliner (and it won't sting if it gets in your eyes)
1129 2018-11-04 21:22:58 Have you been to Bobby Yager’s used horse, firearm and roast elk emporium? They do a lovely thyme ranch gun oil too
1130 2018-11-04 21:22:46 sunday dinner always oil
1131 2018-11-04 21:22:42 From now on only gonna style my hair with coconut oil
1132 2018-11-04 21:22:33 Ooh, I need this! My favorite frying oils are bacon grease and clarified butter. Would love to try it in seal oil! Animal fats = best fats.
1133 2018-11-04 21:22:28 I gotta get a new wok for home and im reading amazon reviews and do white folks actually think non stick means no oil needed...
1134 2018-11-04 21:22:22 What has he done for his constituency really?, he is active more on twitter.
1135 2018-11-04 21:22:17 Go ahead and see the results your economy will collapse at the same time. On the other hand you can’t even survive without oil.
1136 2018-11-04 21:21:58 He dipped into the frying pan with a seething oil a pork chop and for a while it underwent a chemical change and likewise with physical because of such changed in colour and shape.
1137 2018-11-04 21:21:57 Coconut oil! My daughter had it mild in her eyebrows
1138 2018-11-04 21:21:42 This is like Banga stew (ofeakwu). It's mostly like this when you cook with good palm fruits "Ojukwu" or "osukwu" what I mostly do is, while pounding the palm fruits, I squeeze out some fresh palm oil for cooking or eating yam. That way, U avoid this and it's more healthier too.

1140 2018-11-04 21:21:28 Good points. However (1) waivers are only limited and temporary; (2) oil is indeed fungible, but given the Surveillance State which watches and knows (nearly) everything, this will only attenuate the impact of the sanctions.
1141 2018-11-04 21:21:22 Just got mines yesterday. The oil and comb A1. The balm smells good af. Will be buying more of their products.

1146 2018-11-04 21:20:49 Absolutely no offense intended, really and truly. And I'll openly admit you know the oil mkt vastly more than I do, so I'm not calling BS. I'm just (once again) left in the dark...
1147 2018-11-04 21:20:38 My garden neighbor, Atlas, gave me some Okinawan sweet potato greens. I’ve never had it; he’s from the South; treats it like spinach-type greens. I’m preparing with olive oil, garlic, sun dried tomatoes and salt/pepper. Simple. We’ll see...

1152 2018-11-04 21:20:11 U told us oil subsidy was a scam, yet u are paying triple the amount past administration paid. They are now telling us its under recovery.
All this deception will not work,
Oga its sakamanje (scammmmmm)
1153 2018-11-04 21:20:08 YES! Big Mac and hot fries cooked in new (not old) oil and BAM! First real job was at a Micky D's
1154 2018-11-04 21:20:08 For an idea how a modern gold standard could be perfectly implemented I refer you to Jim Rickards's many exposés on this
But a reserve currency could be backed by countries own resources
Not like the petrodollar that's "backed" by violence and the oil of a foreign dictatorship
1155 2018-11-04 21:19:57 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.

1159 2018-11-04 21:19:30 Last night I crumbled goat cheese onto a plate, drizzled a generous amoubt of garlic olive oil on top. Added diced sun dried tomatoes and chopped fresh basil, then a tablespoon of balsamic beads. Yum.
Delicious.
More delicious with baguette and wine . 
But that's just me talking.
1160 2018-11-04 21:19:15 The USA should be sanctioned for Trumps roll back on climate agreement and blatant backing of the coal and oil industry. Civilized responsible nations should be holding him to account
1161 2018-11-04 21:19:03 If China starts buying US oil instead of Iran’s as part of trade deal - you better have a list of low float oil tickers on hand.  I do.

1170 2018-11-04 21:17:48 Can you explain in economical detail of what capacity each country producing oil?
1171 2018-11-04 21:17:29 I have an Argan oil conditioner, it’s amazing for this frizz-making winter weather!
1172 2018-11-04 21:17:20 I felt you were arguing that car emissions were not a significant place to tackle first.

Regarding public funding, just imagine it came from the defense budget if it helps you sleep better. I personally, as a capitalist, would rather see an end to the EV credit AND oil subsidies
1173 2018-11-04 21:17:15 Chef Gusteau cut up some bars of soap, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was his first born child, along with Play-Doh.
1174 2018-11-04 21:17:07 Eh Ian King?  Louisiana sight of the Gulf B.P oil spill?  Eh David Duke?
1175 2018-11-04 21:16:58 Venezuela are corrupt, didn't bother to diversify their economy from oil so when oil prices dropped they were in trouble, have US economic sanctions, have no domestic economy that produces anything so imported everything. How is this anything like the UK?
1176 2018-11-04 21:16:53 Thanks! Yeah, roasted broccoli is so good. With a little bit of olive oil and sprinkling of garlic powder, it's the best! 
1177 2018-11-04 21:16:32 Is that Palm oil of Groundnut oil?
1178 2018-11-04 21:16:31 Hilary,

I was actually going to send olive oil to your address from EATALY beside some other tasty chocolates and cheeses but I knew that you were going to play the smart not to thank and swallow all of them...

Why do you carry the ball with you?
1179 2018-11-04 21:16:15 Fact was oil was over $100 a barrel and health care costs were lower b/c Obama care was not in affect while he was at helm (with no wage growth...)
1180 2018-11-04 21:16:13 And yet everytime someone from eastern Canada heats their home or gasses up their car they are in part funding saudis atrocities. If there were only another source of oil that was far more ethical....

1207 2018-11-04 21:11:38 Because you will not will until India is developed country and world doesn’t rely on oil
1208 2018-11-04 21:11:34 Why did we send him to Afghanistan? Zero security threat from Afghanistan. Again Afghanistan did not attack us on 911.

Just before these mid terms the traitors are trying to stop us natives from voting.

Which means your vote does matter.

1220 2018-11-04 21:10:03 To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it
1221 2018-11-04 21:10:03 Endless oil story
1222 2018-11-04 21:10:01 @StefMichalak hey you mentioned recently about using CBD oil for anxiety, can you tell us more about it? which oil you use & where you get it?
1223 2018-11-04 21:09:50 i've bought that exact same wax kit and it comes with a bottle of oil  for the express purpose of getting leftover wax off your skin, but i don't want to tell that guy because he's suffered more than enough already
1224 2018-11-04 21:09:11 do you mean UCC and CCA?  Or accelerated write offs for say Mining and E dollars in oil and gas?  Or the flex that UIC offers employees and employers to game the system in some regions.  So many elements of our tax system that could be tweaked.

1226 2018-11-04 21:08:58 So use a cleansing oil followed by a cleanser?
1227 2018-11-04 21:08:53 Well...  I got real busy over past 6 months ( teaching people , filming , hustling up opportunity to make investments in for my daughters future ,etc ) .Also , i was waiting for my organic ganja garden to harvest so i could make it into oil . Its kind of hard to work on the oil .
1228 2018-11-04 21:08:46 The only pumping going on is the oil being ducked out...and dumped into copious tankers. It must be obvious from all the activity (tankers,generators)-that THIS IS HAPPENING
1229 2018-11-04 21:08:44 The solution is not to go to Iran, which does mostly the same things anyway, except in the name of Shia Islam. they are both kinda terrible, but until they run out of oil (or get reformed.) what are you going to do? They control the oil. what runs the global trade network.
1230 2018-11-04 21:08:33 Beautiful! You might just inspire me to paint my first oil in over a decade :)
1231 2018-11-04 21:08:24 This your friend cooked oil and not stew
1232 2018-11-04 21:08:20 Nah the actual chicken boiling is like 5 minutes. When you sauté chicken directly in oil all the water basically cooks out if you cook it too long. Plus the water helps the seasoning soak in when you let it cook out. Literally the whole process takes 15/20 min.
1233 2018-11-04 21:08:18 Nigeria has 11 States with crude oil: major oil States (Akwa Ibom,Abia,Imo, Edo,Bayelsa,Rivers, Delta, Ondo &amp; Cross River) + Lagos &amp; Anambra
1234 2018-11-04 21:08:17 I certainly agree that the short term gain in coal and oil were needed for some wonderful and hardworking miners and workers, but I truly believe that his policies are only a short term solution. 3/

1237 2018-11-04 21:08:01 I miss the taste of palm oil
1238 2018-11-04 21:07:46 Iraqi oil was going to pay for the war.  Much like Mexico is going to pay for the wall.
1239 2018-11-04 21:07:40 My doctory opinion is no. But my lazy bum wants to mix Ventolin with eucalyptus oil and put it in the diffuser.
1240 2018-11-04 21:07:36 I was wondering how y’all were doing! 

We were hoping the stem cell clinical trial was a real, positive treatment process. Neurologist told us this week it wasn’t.  I think he likened it to “snake oil”.
1241 2018-11-04 21:07:25 Iran does not the same capacity to produce oil. merely a third of Saudi's at best. Plus Iran had the whole revolution thing in Iran made being friendly to the new regime a difficult thing.

1245 2018-11-04 21:07:18 DMSO it is available at you local co-op. It is cheap. It can help to deliver anything into the cellular level INSTANTLY. Mix in a little with the CBD oil and Apply it Topically. It will feel warm as it is absorbed into the skin but it does so instantly. It is a Nat Byproduct.
1246 2018-11-04 21:07:16 E.... :we discovered oil In Muzarabani 

However invictus dismissed the confirmation.
1247 2018-11-04 21:07:01 I don't really think it's that big of a deal still though also I have never gotten an oil change
1248 2018-11-04 21:06:51 And so much more when you fill your car up with petrol, cause that's how it's turned from oil to petrol and then pumped out of the tanks into a transport tanker, then pumped at the forecourt

1256 2018-11-04 21:05:24 Yeah, the guy was judging us for no oil or coolant but I said that was done in April. After a check he found they both had leaks and we were "forgiven". I think we need a new car. Bit scary when I noticed the smoke. Typical Mercury.
1257 2018-11-04 21:05:19 Pork!!!! Pork my sister . Nobody say weed and codeine or them be oil too?
1258 2018-11-04 21:05:10 Not unless it's Heavy crude oil. Oil is not simply oil, there are several kinds of deposits and (I am not an expert on petrochemicals, so I might be wrong with naming or science here) oil 'types', and venezuela, while it has huge deposits,  much of it is terrible heavy crude.

Omega 3's  inhibit inflammation,  whereas omega 6's increase inflammation.  Fish and fish oils contain  more omega 3's but they may also contain mercury or radiation.

1275 2018-11-04 21:01:54 If he is feeling guilty for over charging for oil and his big pension move to Honduras and help the people.  Oh sorry just an arm chair helper.
1276 2018-11-04 21:01:45 Sweet. Would have been an awesome game to be at. The Oil are contenders once again!!!
1277 2018-11-04 21:01:36 I was also thinking that cotton trousers would probably be a lot more environmentally friendly than polyester/nylon, which are derived from oil and petrol.
1278 2018-11-04 21:01:24 The radical left U.S. Tides Foundation has paid millions to CDN First Nations to fight oil interests, including the Tsleil-Waututh Nation, the main plaintiff cited in the suit against #transmountain

Bolsonaro to Push Forward Giant Brazil Oil Sale, Adviser Says
1287 2018-11-04 21:00:38 Drug makers want to sell more drugs, pesticide makers want to sell more pesticide, oil producers want to sell more oil, sigaret producers want to sell more sigarets.. this is all because banks raise prices of everything by financeing competition. We all suffer for the banks.

1298 2018-11-04 20:59:33 An old saying. “Those who can do. Those who can’t teach.”  Those who can’t do either sell snake oil.
1299 2018-11-04 20:59:14 Yeahdude, it's a necessity; beard hair and face skin is a weird combo of "we're tough" and "but we're tender" so ya gotta oil it up
1300 2018-11-04 20:59:10 Matanma sai a slow
1301 2018-11-04 20:58:57 Olio Santo ... Oil of the saints. Chilies slowly cook an extra virgin olive oil. I make it with fresh chilies and then I make another move dried chilies until they’re almost smoking. Drizzle that oil on pasta, Fish, or nice piece of a burrata
1302 2018-11-04 20:58:54 Let the cocoa/shea butter and coconut oil hug you. Lol. I be drowning in it.
1303 2018-11-04 20:58:51 Seem like some politician is swimming deep in Russian oil - hope they swim deep in the arm of Mueller

1305 2018-11-04 20:58:20 Lol power oil to be precise..someone can’t even glow in peace too
1306 2018-11-04 20:58:18 We kissed the west's arse  for too long. Sell oil in any currency other than dollars ...like China and a few other countries are doing
1307 2018-11-04 20:58:17 was elected. All the racism, sexism & classism that has always been here like oil is rising to the surface. This is a great potent moment in our culture to excise our demons. 
  It fucking sucks and is terrifying. 
But DT can’t erase Obama, no matter how much he wants to.

1309 2018-11-04 20:58:01 $15 an hour to show up is a pretty good incentive. Unless of course you have morals and integrity and actually love our country. Selling your soul to thos snake oil salesman has its consequences. One day you have to pay the piper. Thankfully my conscience is clean. #VoteDem

Even to collect tax 4rm taxable rich was even rocket science for past govt. It was waivers all round.

1322 2018-11-04 20:56:28 If that snake oil salesman wants me to vote for you, there’s a good chance I won’t. Jus’ sayin’
1323 2018-11-04 20:56:17 Lmao  oh okay because it’s impossible to forgive someone and still hate the person you can forgive and don’t trust but hate is impossible it’s like missing oil and water.
1324 2018-11-04 20:56:13 Lol!

Nothing is written on your forehead sis!

You hv prolly Signalled that you want stuff straight up and defined. That if u dig them, u will get down.

Mans them are just following that Vibe.

Leave olive oil alone!
1325 2018-11-04 20:56:09 Secretary Pompeo Defends Sanction Waivers for Iranian Oil Purchases
1326 2018-11-04 20:55:57 Based on Steve Bannon's speech to Vatican, far right wants to have a holy war to save Christianity. Kill them before they kill us kind of stuff--except for the Saudis who they appreciate for their $$$ & oil. I can only assume they'll want to fight only certain factions.
1327 2018-11-04 20:55:56 The commerce department makes loans to lots of businesses - all auto makers in the us took a loan, Tesla repaid it early and with interest. Tax payers got a good return on that..

And getting off foreign oil is a defensive goal, so we don't keep warring in the middle east for oil
1328 2018-11-04 20:55:44 Oily face,  ground nut oil endorsement coming through
1329 2018-11-04 20:55:42 I’ve started using loreal clay masks every two days and clear & clear spot treatment, along with my oil free face wash because I have oily skin !!
1330 2018-11-04 20:55:28 Mark Mark Mark, a man of your experience should know the old saying 'the squeakiest wheel gets the most oil'. There isn't one shred of evidence and no suspects, no witnesses. I'd put it down to auditory distortion.
1331 2018-11-04 20:55:08 Bought every trophy since pint size oil geek arrived.Not long ago their were playing Rochdale
1332 2018-11-04 20:55:04 Oil is oil no matter what parts of the world it originated.

1335 2018-11-04 20:54:27 Agreed, GERS is a bit dodgy: for example, how much of London’s wealth comes from a 40-year oil boom? But at least it’s a set of quantifiable figures, that’s why the SNP have used it to plan for Scotland’s economic future.
1336 2018-11-04 20:54:18 The Glo u tempted me to buy some months ago, they almost made me cry 
1337 2018-11-04 20:54:16 I missed 2 ingredients... worcestershire sauce and olive oil.
1338 2018-11-04 20:54:15 Oh
Oh man

Beard oil is wonderful

Immediately and awesome smelling relief
1339 2018-11-04 20:54:08 The real shambles is that this by-pass had to wait almost 40 years to be built. Neither Tories nor Labour saw fit to action it during all their years in power during the oil boom so you'd maybe better just sit down.
1340 2018-11-04 20:53:58 That’s exactly right. it’s worded all new oil and gas development. If it said wells must be 2500ft then it would be RIG ONLY. Not to mention 112 gives local government the ability to increase those setbacks.
1341 2018-11-04 20:53:46 My top picks are @sundayriley Luna Night Oil and Korres
1342 2018-11-04 20:53:23 Please, take me up on it if it helps. I bet you help others all the time. It'd be nice to turn it round just this once. It'll be nice to be good karma. Give me a DM when you think about it. And @jaimelawson08 does fantastic deals of his excellent oil, just for future reference.
1343 2018-11-04 20:53:20 When do you change your combine oil?
1344 2018-11-04 20:53:19 It is.  Despite its oil wealth Nigeria has a 70% poverty rate.
1345 2018-11-04 20:53:11 Because we didn't give billions to @Tesla. We gave billions to help get us off our dependence on foreign oil - which has caused far too many wars.

Building trains would cost trillions more and take far longer.. and if you needed oil to do it, we'd be at war and burn up first!
1346 2018-11-04 20:53:09 You seriously bring up Yemen?

You guys are running out of oil and seriously pissed off Democrats and liberal media.

We won't forget.
1347 2018-11-04 20:53:00 The enormity of the #rockwool plant can't be understated. The shear size of the plant & amounts of Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPS) are not common to this area of the country. Think oil refineries, WV #coal That's what Rockwool is. And HAPS aren't regulated by the EPA or WVDEP.

1357 2018-11-04 20:51:51 I have allergy issues, and cold pressed coconut oil relieves most of my skin and hair symptoms. I think you shouldn’t leave the oil on while bleaching, as your hair may not get bleached properly?
1358 2018-11-04 20:51:44 @BennGraham I still consider a value play. Oil companies can make money with oil above $65,So yes I think post election could be a catalyst
1359 2018-11-04 20:51:37 I got that oil in me
1360 2018-11-04 20:51:32 Monday: Main crank pulley broke, shattered in two. 
Saturday: Take the engine out because space in the engine bay is non existent and access from the bottom isn’t possible either. While it is out, take it apart as it seems to be leaking oil.
1361 2018-11-04 20:51:30 Rso.  Rick Simpson oil 
1362 2018-11-04 20:51:08 Despite their rhetoric, the Dems are pretty Republican-y on the environment--BOTH parties are destroying it.  Dems increased Repub's illegal wars, pushed fracking, approved pipelines, green-lit seismic blasting for oil/gas, & allowed Arctic drilling/drilling off-shore.
1363 2018-11-04 20:50:59 I never knew such things existed until I saw them on American Pickers, Then again I also never saw anyone pay $2300USD for an empty oil can before watching that show.
1364 2018-11-04 20:50:55 If you think when oil and gas revenue declines, which it always does, that Drew wont coming for us you are completely in denial.
1365 2018-11-04 20:50:54 CNN and facts is like water and oil. The don't go well together.
1366 2018-11-04 20:50:33 Stability is better for business. Its all interconnected. Russia also supplies oil to China to power exports to EU. Destabilising EU is cutting their own throat.
1367 2018-11-04 20:50:24 Phoney data versus real data. Phoney data doesn’t play. It just deceives. It’s snake oil.

Then caption it “Sun kissed” 
1370 2018-11-04 20:50:11 Heard some of you cook noodles without adding groundnut oil? What’s your problem?
1371 2018-11-04 20:50:04 Clearly, specializing on one industry (auto) put all the eggs in one basket. And the city's layout placed total emphasis on the car -- disastrous when oil prices started to rise.

One story often told is that auto managers feared unionization and decentralized their production.
1372 2018-11-04 20:49:56 There's a huge effort to stop or limit climate change. It might not "be enough" but transitioning from coal and oil will make an impact. Mass extinction, far less effort.
1373 2018-11-04 20:49:56 Nigerians, the only way to have steady light & fuel is to remove GEJ. And i promise you in 6 months Nigeria will be swimming in crude oil & fuel. PMB will pay you all #5,000 monthly for been jobless, our youth will be gainfully employed with our 3m jobs a year. Tinubu -2014

1375 2018-11-04 20:49:41 this might be a stretch but I'''d go so far as to say that the PFD is akin to oil companies paying off the voters 
1376 2018-11-04 20:49:39 Don’t listen to BO.... he’s slick....very well oiled puppet...an oil slick...the only thing he did for 8 years was to become a millionaire ....nothing ....WAKE THE FUCK UP AMERICA
1377 2018-11-04 20:49:30 This invasion shows that countries the caravaners come from cannot run themselves properly so there is a very good case for US/UN rule.
Venezuela has more oil than any other country in the world so why is it in such a mess it’s govt is plainly corrupt & incompetent.
1378 2018-11-04 20:49:27 add a little bit of olive oil to some soft cooked broccoli and then "stir fry" it with some garlic, anchovies and chillies... creates an amazingly filling dish, but which is really low calorie as well. divine!
1379 2018-11-04 20:49:22 It’s been drying me out even more I think it’s because it has coconut oil in it
1380 2018-11-04 20:49:16 exactly. Their real point ios that they may have industries like oil bribing them but we have little guys, like the insurance industry helping us,. There are more people like soros than there are like koch. THey try to spin that as bad for us
1381 2018-11-04 20:49:12 Carville is the original snake oil salesman.
1382 2018-11-04 20:49:06 オイルだって、泣きたい時もある。
1383 2018-11-04 20:48:52 The networks won’t cover it because they don’t want to lose revenue from the oil industry.The most important story is ignored.

1386 2018-11-04 20:48:30 Pretty  hard to compete  with @georgesoros #opensociety  California  and new York tides foundation  who are anti oil
1387 2018-11-04 20:48:13 And the Europeans are wrong. The solution is regime change. “Deals involving oil” (whatever that means) are outside Mueller’s alleged purview. So you’ve just admitted Mueller is Javert.

1392 2018-11-04 20:47:50 Your name of course...and.....whilst we are chatting ..I saw your video of you and Uncle Stephen that Adrian posted in 2016. Really good !!
You have interviewed a few in your time. And you said you was oil background yourself ?? That intrigued me too.
1393 2018-11-04 20:47:46 I heard Ali kamenei the Iranian Supreme leader he have Tricks 1-smuggling the oil and sale it by Massinger 2- or trade it with some things. 3- they going to lower the prise .4- or they sale it locally.
1394 2018-11-04 20:47:42 No oil on the moon.
1395 2018-11-04 20:47:34 For me the only option is leaving this dysfunctional so called union  Scotland the only country with oil revenues handled by another nation , leaving our citizens having to use foodbanks.
1396 2018-11-04 20:47:20 Chef Louis cut up some chocolate, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was some  human flesh, along with toothpaste.
1397 2018-11-04 20:47:13 Grading an excellent masters thesis about innovation learning and it makes me so happy. 

Btw, if you somehow got the impression that design thinking consists of hand-waving and snake oil, you are seriously hanging out with the wrong crowd.
1398 2018-11-04 20:47:10 I've been working on a financial model all day for this oil company and I keep taking breaks to read kanej fics how deep am I
1399 2018-11-04 20:47:10 Every night I yank out all of my teeth and soak them in motor oil and tomato paste before shoving them back into my head in the morning. It used to feel like a chore, but now I find it almost meditative.
1400 2018-11-04 20:47:03 I haven't tried this yet, as my sore is not leaking at the moment, but a relative who also suffers with HS, advised me to try Essential Thyme or Oregano oil on the affected area. #stingsabit but says it's worth it.!

“It’s Viking, really. We drink mead and celebrate, then rub oil all over each other and copulate to honor Odin. Before battle. Cause, tradition.”
1404 2018-11-04 20:46:32 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
1405 2018-11-04 20:46:20 Silver has become a snake oil salesman--toeing both sides so he'll be right either way.

1408 2018-11-04 20:46:02 Paravotti's - it was a sandwich shop in the town I grew up in, Jeffersonville, Pa.

 They were famous for their local favorite sandwiche called the "zep", sort of a precurser to the hoagie. simple ingredients:
Cooked Salami, provolone 
Tomato, onion, oregano

1411 2018-11-04 20:45:26 This is the tragedy USA GOP & Trump supporting SA atrocities as long as they give us their oil & $ for arms! With Trump and GOP this is what USA now stands for!
1412 2018-11-04 20:45:23 What of potiskum? Mum will gladly welcome you

1417 2018-11-04 20:44:51 Saudis dont know where their war in Yemen is going, they are just too rich to stop. the war turns into a stage of drying resources, and we can't wait for the Saudi oil to dry to stop this.

1419 2018-11-04 20:44:47 A fucked up world when a war criminal is trying to give morality lessons.
..see that, I managed to insult somebody without killing 100k people to steal oil
1420 2018-11-04 20:44:42 I've said to my friends, more than once, this dipping bread in oil and vinegar is very weird. And the pineapples on pizza...well that's just a sacrilege. 
1421 2018-11-04 20:44:36 Lots of cool people in the @Lucas_Oil Sportsman pits.

1424 2018-11-04 20:43:51 My skin is so dry I feel like I need to take a bath in straight coconut oil
1425 2018-11-04 20:43:49 I am rather partial to a Pina Colada. 
i was going through a list strangely and I imagine it is something quite posh.
1426 2018-11-04 20:43:44 Yup! If they kill our oil/gas industry they had better legalize marijuana(NM needs the tax $$$). Colorado is enjoying the extra money and the state is doing just fine.
1427 2018-11-04 20:43:39 I’ll never understand how the environmental left can rant against oil & gas industry and then go fill up their car’s gas tank in the same day.
1428 2018-11-04 20:43:39 Oil spillage 
1429 2018-11-04 20:43:19 R soles pal,be in the gutter if it wasn't for the oil money
1430 2018-11-04 20:43:04 Desire the truth to be told to your hearts than for oil to be poured on your heads all the time. 

THE TRUTH IS POWER AND LIFE.
1431 2018-11-04 20:43:02 The reason we are stuck with fossil is that the industry keeps corrupting our polticians. We need to start the #waronfossil by getting rid of any fossil lakey and representative. Noone who worked for an oil or coal company, noone who accepts support from oil or coal companies!

You speak sense and good.

Look at those other two who I won't name. Negative and ripping people off.

Thank you #Share_Talk for being .. well ..Share_Talk !!

1434 2018-11-04 20:42:15 refuse to eat or buy anything with palm oil, they are destroying all the rainforests, which directly affects the environment #greenpeace #environmentaldefensefund @Defenders
1435 2018-11-04 20:42:15 The Europeans rather have a bad nuclear treaty with Iran than none. And we’ll see what Mueller reports about Trump and Putin deals involving oil. Or maybe Trump just loves Putin because Putin plays to his vanity which is even dumber.
1436 2018-11-04 20:42:13 Yea, it doesn't work as well as conventional mining unfortunately. In the Oil Sands anyways.
1437 2018-11-04 20:42:02 Wholemeal spelt, made in bread-maker using standard wholemeal recipe, with honey instead of normal sugar & olive oil instead of butter. I replace half the liquid with leftover whey from making #kefir curd cheese which gives it more rise & other liquid half is #organic soy milk.
1438 2018-11-04 20:42:02 Ion oil om – bij Coonskin Par 3
1439 2018-11-04 20:41:59 I feel ya!!!! I have to hope that i can get to a gas station to get gas(obviously) and then get more oil
1440 2018-11-04 20:41:55 Yeah, the fake #democracy that the #Yankees [#Pentagonian criminals] have been trying to impose upon the masses of the #MiddleEast, causing death and destruction of millions of people - oil & democracy are excuses, real motive is to control th region !
1441 2018-11-04 20:41:53 I’ve started using coconut oil as a makeup remover again (it’s honestly the best thing you can use) and the smell of it literally turns me on
1442 2018-11-04 20:41:52 We will have that conversation over cocktails Heid 
1443 2018-11-04 20:41:51 Part.. Just referred to u something that is improving our human development capital including lots more when u compare each president tenures crude oil capital per dollar.
1444 2018-11-04 20:41:48 Showed my baby how easy it is to change the oil. So my car is done now and I got to teach him what my dad thought me. I love learning experiences in my baby’s life to better him.
1445 2018-11-04 20:41:47 Hot oil burn me
1446 2018-11-04 20:41:39 Alright, cool. I’ve been lookin into the oil fields. Halliburton was the only one that offered me a job a while back, just thought $14 an hour was low AF for fracking. 14 on, 7 off schedule. Ima keep lookin.
1447 2018-11-04 20:41:24 The fact that this is pushing the EU to develop mechanisms to bypass the dollar in global oil trade (something Russia, China and regional powers have been working on for years) is huge imo
1448 2018-11-04 20:41:00 This is gonna sound crazy but I have used mayonnaise to get out mark on wood tables. Something about the oil in it. Good luck.
1449 2018-11-04 20:40:59 i have to change my oil today and do my laundry. not much but those are tall orders for a sunday. i feel like my whole day is gonna be wasted
1450 2018-11-04 20:40:52 An oil company??? Involved in pure evil???? What a surprise
1451 2018-11-04 20:40:52 My Daughter is a vegan and is bringing up her Daughter and her husband as vegans, her husband had digestive problems until he met me. As he is now vegan plus I taught him to use peppermint oil, ginger and black pepper to heal himself #vegan
1452 2018-11-04 20:40:35 Jiffy lube gave me a Starbucks gift card for getting synthetic oil

1454 2018-11-04 20:40:24 Vitamin E oil is wonderful! Trader Joes has a cheap, but effective one.
1455 2018-11-04 20:40:20 Are u sure he did not use all your oil reserve to cook it
1456 2018-11-04 20:40:15 Is this one stew or oil spillage?
1457 2018-11-04 20:40:15 I am going to make a group for an Essential Oil Classroom. 

Let me know if you would like to be added to the online classroom!
1458 2018-11-04 20:40:13 Wtf did we do in afghanistan besides secure access to the world's largest supply of opium, steal oil, overthrow their socialist government that they were prospering under, and stay there literally for decades to enforce regime change and suffering.

1460 2018-11-04 20:40:03 I am capitalism and my anatomy is the anatomy of a monster, I breathe fire, I consume oil, I tinker with your pretty brains.
1461 2018-11-04 20:39:55 Some how I think it's the older generation that got bilked by Ceausescu and they taught there children to never trust which is OK but they need jobs and a booming economy. The globalist yes spot on Gold Like your observation in comparison Canadian Oil
1462 2018-11-04 20:39:41 Yes oil does have an extra vibrant quality, although the lustre can sink into the ground over time and sometimes dull down.
1463 2018-11-04 20:39:31 Then having your pizza delivered in 20 minutes or 5 hours doesn't matter? Quick Oil Change & Fast Food can go at their own pace?
Your Doctor or Dentist can have a schedule of "I'll be in when I feel like it"? 
Got it. 
1464 2018-11-04 20:39:27 lol, it'll be more scary if you write it in yoruba. drop it at orita meta and write ebo, don't forget to pour red oil on it
1465 2018-11-04 20:39:19 So did I bless them...i was thinking this morning that all the dog's names
begin with B and I was wondering what the B was in your name?
1466 2018-11-04 20:39:05 تشرفنا بتعاملك معنى ونتمنى ان نكون عند حسن ظنك
1467 2018-11-04 20:39:03 NB Without the academia you and the hard right despise out of a knee jerk rejection of intellect, the US would be like Russia, a gas station run by a tin pot dictator. Actually we wouldn’t even have the gas station because enhanced oil recovery tech came out of academia.
1468 2018-11-04 20:38:59 Stop looking for people to Love the oil that's on your life... Your assignment was to"Go" not wait on approval
1469 2018-11-04 20:38:36 You haven't seen the ones that add red oil and locust beans

1471 2018-11-04 20:38:27 I’m trying to order olive oil from Liguria lmao and some sausage low key
1472 2018-11-04 20:38:23 You can clearly see that both the Ontario and Canada average fell along the same pattern because oil fell. How stupid and blind do you have to be to not see this?
1473 2018-11-04 20:38:22 But have sixteen years of war in Afghanistan done anything to defend America? The War on Terror is just a scam for the military industrial complex to sell more weapons to the Pentagon, that is when it is not blatantly to benefit oil companies. Why don't you ever admit to that?
1474 2018-11-04 20:38:15 I feel like when you put milk first then cereal. The cereal float at the top. Like oil and water.
1475 2018-11-04 20:38:13 You know we love your tradecraft sir 
1476 2018-11-04 20:38:13 Buhari's past is more horrible than Atiku's.  The $2.8 billion oil money missing , the PTF  corruption spree. There isn't ANY corruption case against Atiku. Even Buhari hailed him just months ago.
1477 2018-11-04 20:38:03 The only oil industry is the decommissioning of rigs.
1478 2018-11-04 20:38:00 Coconut milk..thickened with a little coconut oil, yummy! #dairyfree
1479 2018-11-04 20:38:00 Can I just put Ventolin in my essential oil diffuser and call it a day? Asking for a friend... #asthma
1480 2018-11-04 20:37:52 Ya ever put oil on your tomatoes? - Dad
1481 2018-11-04 20:37:51 Great Whitebait! Today’s special Cornish Crab Meat on Toast with aioli oil and fries!
1482 2018-11-04 20:37:51 In other fascinating news today, I learned that you can make a white sauce with olive oil instead of butter. Who knew
1483 2018-11-04 20:37:38 The choice is obvious, Canadian oil or blood oil. Shouldn’t be a difficult choice.
1484 2018-11-04 20:37:25 Well said Heid. That Music brought tears to my eye when Share_Talk put our videos up. I was shocked. I never thought anyone would ever take any notice of me  Fab. Viva Share Talk.

and big sunscreen (but no oil cleanser) in morning
1489 2018-11-04 20:37:04 I thought #bailey #benny & #booby leading the charge was the best bit
1490 2018-11-04 20:37:01 It is not profitable to drill for oil in the United States unless gas is about $3.30.

答え.(C)
1492 2018-11-04 20:36:23 Dark Inventory has two sides rolling: oil risk swap vs $ risk. When prepay oil repo ends #BigLong funders cease spot purchases (so market is caught short) & deliver borrowed oil in tank/reserves vs return of dollars. Whoever lent oil resumes market risk once oil title is returned
1493 2018-11-04 20:36:12 All the outrage in the world ain't stoppin anyone from filling their car with gas from Saudi oil tbh. Ain't no one trying to piss of someone who can charge you 8bucks for a gallon of fuel. Its ugly but that's the way it is right now. Realpolitik and all
1494 2018-11-04 20:36:10 Pasta sauce, hummous, flavoring some good olive oil, garlic toast, breath mints for a bad date.... just off the top of my head.
1495 2018-11-04 20:36:05 Me too.  I just read up on it, it seems Benjamin Franklin suggested it way back when to save on candles and oil lamps.  I don't believe that's an issue anymore.
1496 2018-11-04 20:36:04 “RAAWWWWW” the queen roared as her nose bled. With a giant balled up fist rammed Zilla in the guy hard enough to fold her in two. Then followed with an upper cut that launched her in the air, and duel jump kicked her as she fell sending her into an oil tanker in the bay
1497 2018-11-04 20:36:04 Vote-out all aipac cufi adl cfr big oil banker owned politicians.

Make your #Vote count.

46% of U.S. voters didnt even vote last election.

Just before these mid terms the traitors are trying to stop us natives from voting.

Which means you vote does matter.
1498 2018-11-04 20:36:01 Toen Standard Oil Company te groot werd, door op slinkse manier concurrenten kapot te maken en daarna over te nemen.. kwam er een rechtszaak tegen ze, waardoor ze uiteindelijk opgesplitst werden in 34 afzonderlijke bedrijven.. Zoiets kan Amazone, Google en anderen ook overkomen..
1499 2018-11-04 20:36:00 Energy East, TMX, keystone  XL, line 3 and gateway pipelines. Would have allowed for all the exports Canada’s energy sector needed.  Nothing controversial about any of these projects. Oil pipelines have been moving oil since the 50s.  Courts and the rest of it, is just bs.
1500 2018-11-04 20:35:27 Should I try for this during the VIB sale?  I'm running out of both my face oil AND AHA serum
1501 2018-11-04 20:35:17 Mix in a little “stink oil” and indelible ink for effect and to give them something to remember their adventure by! 
1502 2018-11-04 20:35:15 Kit is much the same apart from a few oil bits.
Experience is the biggest one. Noise, smell, fumes, pressures, commissioning by sight of flame and chimney
1503 2018-11-04 20:35:03 That’s not a bad thing. Haha 
I do that too sometimes! 
The recipe is so simple, really. High quality mozzarella, homemade pizza dough, tomato paste, and olive oil are the true secrets! 
1504 2018-11-04 20:34:49 Needs an oil rig in the background but yeah
1505 2018-11-04 20:34:46 do yall think ryan made evan soak in oil for ahs cult and thats why kai is so greasy
1506 2018-11-04 20:34:41 This is definitely a sacrifice or car engine oil.. Not stew!!!!
1507 2018-11-04 20:34:26 So what's going to make me drink the 13bottles of olive oil u are talking about? 
1508 2018-11-04 20:34:20 vape oil. Please I must see
1509 2018-11-04 20:34:09 Ah... That’s pretty wonky snake oil marketing. So either... the ol bait n switch... or a truly blunderous misappropriation of what the blizzcon crowd was looking forward to... or creative arrogance believing they could do no wrong. But clearly something was miscalculated here...
1510 2018-11-04 20:34:06 @jiffylube @JiffyLube_Live you really need to train your staff. I was called out in front of customers about me asking why it’s taking 1.5 hours to get an oil change the BBB needs to be notified
1511 2018-11-04 20:34:01 This is engine oil
1512 2018-11-04 20:33:52 Simple stuff really. Good cockles, a little white wine, lemon zest, parsley, olive oil, and a touch of good wine vinegar - that’s it . Steam the turbot and serve with a little pickled celery

1515 2018-11-04 20:33:33 I’m off the oil..
1516 2018-11-04 20:33:28 Nov 6th Elections in USA.Historically the party in control likes to keep our oil  prices down before the Elections.Lots of calls to MBS and Opec to play ball.After Nov 6 the oil cartels will not have a gun to their head .
1517 2018-11-04 20:33:20 Does anyone on here have lpg/oil and is it hard to do.? Cost.? Additional kit to buy? Etc. Potentially thinking of moving to an area with less NG so would need to retrain and get other qualifications.?

1520 2018-11-04 20:33:17 Improvements in fuel efficiency are steady, but incrementally small. For example, they would explain a long-timeline observation--that US oil consumption today sits around levels first seen in 1998--but not the short term, like gasoline consumption 2014-2018.
1521 2018-11-04 20:33:15 Modi failed with his demonization scheme. 
Modi's govt have let people like Vijay Mallya  go away
Modi has not brought any black money into India.
Modi's have failed to keep the price of oil in check within country
BJP is threatening to take control of media
1522 2018-11-04 20:33:14 He really came across as intensely dislikable in that clip, like the worst kind of snake oil salesman.
1523 2018-11-04 20:33:13 What lies? Which is not Magaya from the follwing:
1. Aguma,
2. anointed wrist bands,
3. anointed water of life,
4. anointed oil,
5. anointed lipstick, or
6. anointed maize? 

I pray that you anchor your faith in God and not men. After Magaya is done with you Christ remains.
1524 2018-11-04 20:33:13 trump's appointments have gutted EPA and Education.  Deregulating polluting companies is okay until the oil or toxins wash up on your shore. When children come up with cancer taxpayers ultimately get the price tag with doctors bills and mental damage.
1525 2018-11-04 20:33:10 i have coconut oil running all down my neck and back rn since im doing a scalp treatment
1526 2018-11-04 20:33:06 By all informed analysis the price signal sent by the carbon fee in I 1631 is insufficient to encourage the level of behavior change required. In this way the fee just becomes a cost of business that fossil fuel  projects into future operations. Loopholes + low price = Oil wins
1527 2018-11-04 20:32:47 #WW1OnThisDay 1918 4/11 3/Army (V Corps): 'N' Special Co RE discharged oil at the road junction at the corner of Foret de Mormal near Englefontaine. 52 Bde (17 Div) met a tangle of orchards west of Mormal Forest (1).
1528 2018-11-04 20:32:45 very well shot video and the music goes great.
1529 2018-11-04 20:32:41 Yeah I need to get me some of that castor oil for sure & dm me a picture of the beeswax you talking about or are they combined already?
1530 2018-11-04 20:32:37 The day I go to get an oil change it’s a hour wait 
1531 2018-11-04 20:32:23 Guy in a pre roll ad on YouTube, wearing camo and has a beard: "What happened to guys being MEN? Now they wear bowties and drink lattes! What happened to manual labor and getting dirty! We're bringing it back! That's why I created an oil to keep your beard shiny and soft...
1532 2018-11-04 20:32:21 Move to where hubby got his oil for 40 years if you really want to see some suffering....
1533 2018-11-04 20:32:21 It's called a subsidy, and anyone who says otherwise has been drinking the libertarian kool-aid.
Yup, no money for health, poverty or anything else, but always LOTS for the oil companies.
1534 2018-11-04 20:32:17 It's oil/transportation technology. Key inventions were mostly in place by the 1930s; the difference in the 1940s-1970s was spreading them out to the second world. In US, poorest parts  (including Puerto Rico) grew fastest.
1535 2018-11-04 20:32:14 Oil have never met a mf'er in my life that complains as much as she does
1536 2018-11-04 20:32:00 Garlic and oil
1537 2018-11-04 20:31:58 #WW1OnThisDay 1918 4/11 3/Army (IV Corps): 111th Bde (37 Div) met heavy resistance from Louvignies despite oil being projected in to assist. 37 Div engaged in hand-to-hand fighting in orchards. Louvignies was taken & progress made at the railway near Ghissignies (1).
1538 2018-11-04 20:31:56 Self care Sunday!!

Salt bath  

-epsom salt (magnesium relieves muscle tension)
-honey (softens skin)
-plain yogurt (softens skin)
-coconut/olive oil (hydrates skin)
-soap (no sulfates/artificial dyes is best)

Relax. Feel good. Love yourself. 
1539 2018-11-04 20:31:52 What is this? Even the pot drink oil
1540 2018-11-04 20:31:49 Why should I add water or oil based cleansers to my routine?
1541 2018-11-04 20:31:49 and of course like the oil meme

1546 2018-11-04 20:31:18 Maybe driving the price of oil up is the real reason for hating Iran.  Maybe Exxon Mobil is getting payback on its campaign donations.
1547 2018-11-04 20:31:04 And the most ethical, social and environmentally responsible product. But hey, let's import billions of dollars if Saudi oil, while our government tweets condemnation for their human rights. Fucking twats.

1553 2018-11-04 20:30:46 Legitimate question for @NancySilverton and not just my usual begging her to let me live with her or go to Italy with her or share her sourdough starter with me. What’s the best olive oil someone can buy (cooking & finishing varieties) in the US? (New York, so access to a lot.)
1554 2018-11-04 20:30:45 2) Secondly, the US is going after Iran because Iran is the only nation capable of hurting the Saudi oil supply, and Saudi arabia is the only nation capable of  hurting iranian oil. The two nations are in a cold war. The us takes the side of the country that supplies the most oil

1560 2018-11-04 20:29:49 The Republicans are doing exactly what they said they were going to do for years. Tax breaks for the wealthy, conservative appointments to the US Supreme Court, end welfare, build up the military and end dependency on foreign oil. They failed on the deficit.

1562 2018-11-04 20:29:44 He bought a new foam instead of drying they old one. That guy should stop frying his with crude oil.
1563 2018-11-04 20:29:39 1) Well, Venezuela has the worst oil in the world, and only china is willing to buy it en-masse, and even that if Venezuela essentially pays for shipping.

Alaska is not enough for the world. Saudi Arabia is the number 1 exporter of Oil. and it's good oil.
1564 2018-11-04 20:29:36 A significant part of this is declines in the price of natural gas and oil. Both of which contribute to GHGs. It won't be free to get off fossil fuels. But we should start eliminating the worst of them and use the cleaner ones like NG as bridging fuels.

1571 2018-11-04 20:28:22 The Oil company advertised an article promoting EV (counter to their agenda) purely because it maligned Tesla. In US corporate law it is illegal for companies (monopolistic) to collude to try and force another company out of business. To me this qualifies as "restraint of trade"
1572 2018-11-04 20:28:21 With a little oil, those poles will be just fine.

1587 2018-11-04 20:24:44 I have a friend who doesn't vote in the midterms unless I ask. He also went years w/o brushing his teeth, changing the oil in his car, eating more than once a day. Clear psych issues he's WAY too poor to fix. Dems offering free therapy to poor folk? No. But sure, let's shame him.
1588 2018-11-04 20:24:29 My soups tend to change based on what I have on hand, but the process I follow tends to stay the same: oil the pot with olive oil and butter, add meat and vegetables to the hot oil first (meat has to be cooked for me before I add other things)...
1589 2018-11-04 20:24:23 Maybe he has found new way to look for oil...by sticking head in sand. Yes I am being silly.. need to not take him to serious.

1592 2018-11-04 20:23:59 Oil isn’t made out to be the answer to all our prayers but be clear, in an independent Scotland it doesn’t ‘belong to the UK Govt! However, calling folk ‘GNATS’ makes you an irrelevant moron!

1621 2018-11-04 20:19:51 My two cents is that we need the public to be as or more enraged that we send our loved ones to fight wars for money/oil and no longer to protect our freedoms. #priorities #letsdothis

1650 2018-11-04 20:15:21 The main difference between oil and acrylic may be temporal: time is speeded up with acrylic due to its quicker drying. Everything else is (visually) similar, except for the vibrancy, saturation aspect once you add volume/layers of paint (acrylic struggles here).

1664 2018-11-04 20:13:47 Bradley, McDermott is a snake oil salesman and a charlatan. And the Pegulas are either extremely gullible or extremely cynical. I'm inclined to believe it's the latter; we keep coming to games.

1675 2018-11-04 20:11:56 I think you are reaching here. In Pres. Obama’s 1st term gas prices were  $1.30/gal. Also look at what goes into the increases. Oil is a volatile commodity, states/cities tax it. In OR 50% $/gal is tax. Hurricanes & Flooding. Look @ the full picture.

1677 2018-11-04 20:11:27 Oh no no no no no! We do NOT want them here! We have enough crazy going on without the oil slick that comes with DJT2 and Eric!

1680 2018-11-04 20:11:12 Any natural coconut oil, I’m telling you especially after you shave or wax or whatever & if you’re a pro mix that bitch with some tea tree oil and lavender will change your life
1681 2018-11-04 20:10:48 To think this group of minions are the once singing the looted and didn't save money during the oil boom song...it's a pity that we allowed this chameleons into the seat of power.
1682 2018-11-04 20:10:33 Skin so soft dry oil body spray brilliant product.
1683 2018-11-04 20:10:26 Did laundry, gave the girl puppies haircuts, got my oil changed finally and a truly desperately needed car wash. I’m really proud of myself
1684 2018-11-04 20:10:22 Indeed
1685 2018-11-04 20:10:15 I live deep in the dark pine forest. Welcome to come see me anytime. -_- all visitors have to bring wood and oil.
1686 2018-11-04 20:10:08 Beard oil!
1687 2018-11-04 20:10:04 I will never understand how people believed the snake oil salesman of all time was going to "fix" anything. @realDonaldTrump
1688 2018-11-04 20:10:03 バターとかマーガリンとか知らないけど多分吸ったぜ。
1689 2018-11-04 20:09:44 I meant "crude oil" metaphorically... The same way we saw the potential in the south south with Oil and practically abandoned everything else.. We shouldn't see the manufacturing potential of the SE and abandon others

We agree on harnessing multiple resources without neglect
1690 2018-11-04 20:09:41 use a moisturizer and put on an a face oil to lock it in and use a sheet mask on the flight!!
1691 2018-11-04 20:09:32 My god. Michael, Only 6.4 Billion profits but they spent 32B on startup. Then the messes all over and you think it's good? Opec oil needed to thin it out to pump in the pipes. Ugh, there is that expense to pay too. Who needs an economist? You do.
1692 2018-11-04 20:09:31 Seen it around here, never bought it though.  I need coffee that has a good flavor and enough caffeine to get me going. Some brands work, others clearly don't...but not into used motor oil coffee
1693 2018-11-04 20:09:28 To be completely honest I do not have a hair routine at all. Except from using a gentle shampoo and hair oil every other day. Actually didnt use that at all until like 2 months ago. My classmates and others always complimented me on my helthy hair despite bleaching it
1694 2018-11-04 20:09:27 Why would the USA import oil? Our oil producers are clamoring to sell their oil products overseas. I'm confused.
1695 2018-11-04 20:09:23 @realFemiOtedola Happy Birthday Sir "CEO FORTE OIL" More Grace Dad!
1696 2018-11-04 20:09:17 My face fake sensitive,  I've been using this coconut oil for years now and all of a sudden my skin doesn't fck with it anymore 
1697 2018-11-04 20:09:03 Are you stupid!! 
Do you know how Saudi Arabia produces oil barrels a day?
How much does Yemen produce before the war?
In 2001 was about 466 thousand barrels per day, the highest level the oil Yemen's!!
The Saudi Arabia has produced more than 10 million barrels of oil a day
1698 2018-11-04 20:08:55 He must be into oil and gas

1704 2018-11-04 20:08:37 In an ideal world, Abate would be working at an olive oil company in Italy, not be a professional football player
1705 2018-11-04 20:08:11 U.S. has caved on the Iran sanctions - waivers have been given to 8 countries who are major buyers of Iranian oil. Two of them China & India are also violating U.S. sanctions on Russian arms purchases yet they are getting waivers on that. Boeing, Lockheed & other american firms
1706 2018-11-04 20:08:09 Every car I’ve owned requires full synthetic oil . WAI?
1707 2018-11-04 20:07:46 Everything oil
1708 2018-11-04 20:07:38 Need Gas, an oil change & a new fuck’n tire.
1709 2018-11-04 20:07:33 Blah blah blah.... nobody has outspent Obama!  How many jobs did the biggest influx of government capital did Obama create?   None!   If you can’t understand the benefits of oil, gas and steel being produced in this country you’re too damn dumb to converse with!
1710 2018-11-04 20:07:29 who wants to come take turns giving each other essential oil massages pls
1711 2018-11-04 20:07:15 apparently cannabis oil calms them

1714 2018-11-04 20:06:36 She sure will, least u know the difference between a wine bottle and an olive oil bottle now ;) love U always xxx
1715 2018-11-04 20:06:32 Just get yourself a bottle of olive oil. Rub on and get in the sun. You're welcome.
1716 2018-11-04 20:06:29 @CubCadet_USA I bought a snowblower from @HomeDepot. Does it come with oil preinstalled or do I need to put some in?
1717 2018-11-04 20:06:22 I moved to Leduc because it was closer to for the SO (worked in Nisku),   family in Leduc, and I could get downtown fast by transit (and  hopefully  get a job in Nisku/EIA area).   Oil crashed, and now we both  commute to Edmonton. The hope is to move  into Edmonton eventually.
1718 2018-11-04 20:06:05 afore ye.  It,should have been "You'll take the high road and Oil take the low road (smacks bum).
1719 2018-11-04 20:05:57 Yeah but trucks and trains spill more oil than pipes which is what would happen if you didn’t build them.
1720 2018-11-04 20:05:55 That's cause oil fell, genius.
1721 2018-11-04 20:05:33 I hate when I put on too much coconut oil like damn bitch, I just wanted to shine, not smell like the shit
1722 2018-11-04 20:05:28 they want to break Saudis American relationships ..if its happen the oil price will become 4 times double and this will hit American economy ..they wants to hit your economy to be their slave..did you notice any financial specialist asking to cut the relations with KSA ??
1723 2018-11-04 20:05:25 So why are we going after Iran if Saudi is hated even more? It seems it would be more easier to ally with Iran and use the Oil reserves from other parts of the world. I.E. Venezuela or Alaska.
1724 2018-11-04 20:05:23 As in oil everywhere
1725 2018-11-04 20:05:19 i spent a few summers on my uncle's farm. i'm ashamed to say i learned to drive from him. your monsanto-cum-bayer monoculture, tilled by topsoil reducing fossil fuel tractors, fertilized by oil, and prettified by deadly insecticide and herbicide, seems a lazy way to grow.
1726 2018-11-04 20:05:18 Btw, ISIS is most active in oil rich provinces. How convenient.
1727 2018-11-04 20:05:03 2021 when oil around 185 $

Et bien on est dans la m....e
1729 2018-11-04 20:04:52 Not at all, rotten PDP
The outcome of your so called strategy session in Dubai will amount to nothing
We've a sign of what to come when candidate Atiku lied that he's going to bring down litre of petrol to N90
Lies!
You can only crash prices when u refine crude oil at home
Liars!
1730 2018-11-04 20:04:34 I have but one life ambition and it is to end up on the Nextdoor app for doing some unsophisticated shit. Probably spilling car oil all over the the street or something
1731 2018-11-04 20:04:28 More revenue?     You mean the oil sheikh funding his own team via dodgy over inflated sponsorships. Bigger stadium mcity never sell out. Small irrelevant club.
1732 2018-11-04 20:04:22 Clinique has an oil balm that is everything
1733 2018-11-04 20:04:20 That's good. However, what about the purification of the Holy Ganga? These vessels will spill effluents, oil etc. polute it more? How wd that be taken care of?
1734 2018-11-04 20:04:10 I agree. For me, IMO, it is just another layer of administration. Plus the fact the GNATS  have wasted millions and continue to do so in their quest for Indy. The audacity to think that revenues(which belong to the UK Govt) from oil could be their answer to everything.
1735 2018-11-04 20:03:58 She loved you so much, you were her wee third daughter. She’ll be in heaven now pouring olive oil into a wine glass, laughing at us. I love you so much 
1736 2018-11-04 20:03:48 I don’t enjoy deep frying! On my first attempt of making doughnuts I got the oil too hot and they were so burnt . I used a sugar thermometer this time and managed to control the temperature much better.
1737 2018-11-04 20:03:46 هذه عائشة بنت خيرت الشاطر فك الله أسرهما.
1738 2018-11-04 20:03:38 Keep fracking and drilling for oil? Keep trying to save coal mining jobs? Keep moving shale  oil in pipelines through aquifers?
1739 2018-11-04 20:03:02 The only attacks against fossil fuel sites that came to mind was Saddam torching oil wells as they fled Kuwait. Those fires were snuffed in months instead of the predicted years.
1740 2018-11-04 20:03:00 Try CBD oil. It works.
1741 2018-11-04 20:02:50 People that are using our CBD oil, are reporting an almost instantaneous response to any pain they are feeling. If you want to know more just PM me . Always happy to help.
1742 2018-11-04 20:02:44 Nice, what oil do you fry them in?
1743 2018-11-04 20:02:37 Im such a cook, putting new oil in my fryer excites me 
1744 2018-11-04 20:02:24 Security could be far worse save for the “Mild” intervention of this govt. 
Economy will surely bounce back with the increase in oil prices.
Meanwhile, they’ve gone ahead with some laudable capital projects, and an agenda to do more as reflected in the next budget.

1746 2018-11-04 20:02:12 The way I am fighting there is no way I am not being tortured alive day and night from those involved in deforestation and illegal logging, trafficking animals and children, oil and gas industry, overfishing companies, illegal fishing, mining and illegal mining!  Hello!!
1747 2018-11-04 20:02:11 I just feel like eating yam with palm oil pffftttt
1748 2018-11-04 20:01:51 I read other posts here and they are all so negativistic. Sounds like the oil barons hire tweeters to slag the clean energy market do-ers !  What a bunch of Sad Sacks ! Many renewable energy sources that do not need oil. That is why they are afraid of new free energy sources!
1749 2018-11-04 20:01:42 I’m not boycotting Amazon over Saudi Arabia. I save gas by ordering online, which means I’m also not supporting the oil industry! I have no lucrative deals with SA. I do however make lots of deals with Amazon!!  (And I have no complaints about WAPO.)
1750 2018-11-04 20:01:38 Do you do like a veg loaf thingy? or just not have meat? The roasties were so good mate. I did them in coconut oil bc thats all I had in and it has made them super crispy.

1752 2018-11-04 20:01:20 Is this meaningful?
Dana's comment was obout reducing and even eliminating our oil cravings. The talking points which always come up is how great the industry is because... plastic, even though we don't need oil to make plastics. And if we did we'd have a nearly unlimited supply.
1753 2018-11-04 20:01:09 Put some Comfrey Oil on Jack's hip. It is brilliant for joints, broken bones etc. 100% herbal and cheap as chips. I used it on my dog's fracture, vet said he'd never seen a break heal so quickly and cleanly.
1754 2018-11-04 20:00:46 I dislike coconut oil for that. My hair feels dirty afterwards

CBD doesn’t have the psychoactive properties of its more famous cousin THC, which is illegal to sell.

1772 2018-11-04 19:58:11 oh I think I saw one of these. I though you were talking about like coco oil, which I also use when I feel my hair going into freak out mood.
1773 2018-11-04 19:57:44 Oil prices are going down. Are you not aware ?
1774 2018-11-04 19:57:29 small fish, private initiatives, that steal from the big fish that has to economize since 2015 as the price of oil dropped from 130 to 70 USD. The state budget for that year counted on with 100 USD, that's why these have been no more tolerated.
1775 2018-11-04 19:57:26 always had coconut oil as part of my hair care and it feels so weird without it
1776 2018-11-04 19:57:12 Plus Malaysia has a well established oil n gas sector and lots of offshore oil drilling in Sabah and Sarawak. Their expertise in oil n gas is at par with West.

What's your pleasure today?
1779 2018-11-04 19:56:35 That was only half usual size. Plus using gluten free flour & lacto free milk . Tray is excellent. No oil, no preheat. Just batter in & cook.

1802 2018-11-04 19:54:21 what is the point of rice without some kind of oil
1803 2018-11-04 19:54:09 According to @BCRmercados, #Argentina‘s main export sectors are #cereals, #oilseeds and #byproducts (43%), #automotive (12%), #mining (9%), #oil and #petrochemical (7%), #bovine #meat (6%), #fruits (4%) and #fishing (3%).
1804 2018-11-04 19:53:41 So then I suppose oil is more virtuous than water.

1808 2018-11-04 19:53:31 Reviewing old notes while writing books is boring while being fun, illuminating. September 3, 1980:  "You want our oil? Then you must buy our gas, too, and at competitive prices. Oil & gas. Package deal. Take it or leave it." Hmm, how'd that work out? #SaudiArabia #Unveiled
1809 2018-11-04 19:53:29 while youre there tell them that youre raising oil prices starting 12:01 am tonight

cheers!
1810 2018-11-04 19:53:28 I find it absurd how some people can’t see the clear correlation between rising interests rates, and the sudden braking of the economy. True when gas goes up groceries do as well.(transport costs) why is oil at a record low?... yet only some states have high gas$ state tax issue.
1811 2018-11-04 19:53:17 America is not reliant on Saudi Arabia's Oil anymore (Hurray for shale!). The rest of the world is. Iran threatens these oil exports (mostly to oil hungry Asia), and right now Asia is important to the US. *really* important.

Hence the US protecting Saudi Arabia and hating Iran.
1812 2018-11-04 19:53:13 Oh jeez yeah. I mean, what a task... “Wednesday: Rub oil all over Adam’s body.” I’d be taking my time with that one!
1813 2018-11-04 19:53:10 Yeah. Some kind of oil
1814 2018-11-04 19:53:00 Give them an oil platform on which to live and be odious.

1818 2018-11-04 19:52:30 1953. Basically he was elected and wouldn’t bow down to British & American oil interests so the CIA overthrew him and reinstalled the Shah. The Shahs secret police were brutal and persecuted anyone with democratic ideas
1819 2018-11-04 19:52:24 Then what? Baby oil?
1820 2018-11-04 19:52:21 Let's see if that happens. Even if construction of #RamMandir starts one day before the elections, @narendramodi will get full credit. Otherwise, he should suffer a loss no less worse than ABV in 2014.
1821 2018-11-04 19:52:19 More jobs would have been lost with fall of oil prices under the Cons.. and will be, Kenney want to fire teachers, nurses and stop schools and infrastructure... seems like we will be worse off, that is not rocket science!
1822 2018-11-04 19:52:05 A good beard oil ... is necessary. I like Detroit grooming company but Prospector company .. Is my favorite.
1823 2018-11-04 19:51:47 Hair oil ? I don’t know what it is omg
1824 2018-11-04 19:51:30 Стекольный разум.

Хотя, если брать сюжет во внимание, то Стекольное Стекло будет точнее.
1825 2018-11-04 19:51:28 When we talk about it replacing opioids, we're mainly referring to CBD pills and oil which do not contain the THC that makes you high. It only provides anxiety and pain relief which won't impair your motor skills. Some people can still drive high, but I wouldn't encourage it.
1826 2018-11-04 19:51:20 Oh dear don't use conditioners! That's pure silicones and buildup!
Use hair oil instead! Same effect mich more gentle and no buildup
1827 2018-11-04 19:51:16 #UKOG 

Did you know when free flowing oil is pushed up the well to the surface and dry oil is produced. There is no more need for a pump and it is removed.

Fool News
1828 2018-11-04 19:51:15 Your head get oil
1829 2018-11-04 19:51:15 Rose hip oil is good & tea tree oil.
1830 2018-11-04 19:51:11 Last night I spilled half the bottle of my basically brand new and expensive facial oil and I didn’t know whether to stay calm & collected or cry... so I just went to sleep.
1831 2018-11-04 19:51:04 Yep yep.  I feel that.  I had a lady with Celiacs who wanted calamari once and I had to practically beg the chef to change the oil before trying her non-breaded calamari.

Like: that shit will kill her, and no I won't tell her "order something else" because WE CAN do it.
1832 2018-11-04 19:50:54 We can do more with soya bean meal and crude soya oil
1833 2018-11-04 19:50:49 Sick of losing money....
Several Alberta E&P's cutting production of heavy oil. $32. USD PB ?
1834 2018-11-04 19:50:21 I can understand why the Union is so *precious* to England. Without Scotland’s net contribution to the treasury and its oil, gas and other resources they would be much diminished.
1835 2018-11-04 19:50:20 Well, they said beard oil.. so it works for bearded men not underage kids.
1836 2018-11-04 19:50:18 @MikePenceVP WE HEAR THAT VENEZUELA WILL BE DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY BUT WE DONT SEE ANY ACTION.THEY STEALT ALL THE OIL,GOLD,AND PEOPLE DIYIN!HELP

1842 2018-11-04 19:49:43 Swing state my ass, you make it by what you support. Voting the lesser evil is lazy and the cowards way out.
I live in CA, it's a so-called Blue state and is as Neo-Liberal as hell.
Our Gov cosies up with big oil/gas.
1843 2018-11-04 19:49:41 I started a family tradition of turkey, broccoli and onion omelettes for breakfast after Thanksgiving! We LOVE them!

For Christmas, I smoke a turkey for gatherings and make Kahlua for gifts! Christmas dinner, my son loves lamb with olive oil and rosemary!
1844 2018-11-04 19:49:39 I ran outta hair products and my hair was dry af so I made a masque from aloevera I found in the garden and honey + coconut oil I found in the kitchen. Lemme tell you.....my hair and face feel like silk wow 
1845 2018-11-04 19:49:35 I disagree. He’s had a deregulatory position on domestic oil prod which encourages exploration. He’s also tried to revive coal/nuclear energy sectors which adversely affects oil prices. Also, the article you quoted above says he’s affecting oil prices, so which is it? Yes or no?
1846 2018-11-04 19:49:20 Oil chafu kapigwa KO

1853 2018-11-04 19:49:02 Roast them and make garlic broth! Or just roast them, mash them with some butter or olive oil, and freeze the paste to use later as really delicious seasoning. (Super good on turkey if you celebrate Thanksgiving, btw.)

1858 2018-11-04 19:47:48 If China, India or any other country is aloud to purchase oil from Iran, then we are indirectly allowing those countries to fund Iranian terrorism around the world.
1859 2018-11-04 19:47:37 I remember when Ralph suggested that oil patch rewrite the Alberta school curriculum...
1860 2018-11-04 19:47:27 Stew oil 
1861 2018-11-04 19:47:26 The pump is removing the fluids out down the well.

Oil and gas start mixing with the fluids . It's called cleaning up. Eventually the fluids are pumped out and soluble gas pushes the Oil to the surface.

Tick Tock.

Viva #UKOG! #HORSEHILL .
1862 2018-11-04 19:47:14 so much oil thou.  lolol

1864 2018-11-04 19:47:12 The thing tired me, I'll ask the bouncers to bounce her out if it was my wedding
1865 2018-11-04 19:47:08 historical reminder: the downfall of the USSR is far from "gorby sold us out to america".

there was an agri/economic crisis going back to the 1970s, which was at first mitigated via imports, but then oil prices dropped. perestroika was just another attempt to solve it.
1866 2018-11-04 19:47:06 How can there be so much negativity from #LFC fans? After 11 games: 8 wins 3 draws 0 losses and it’s all gone to shit for some. Joint-best start to a season not good enough! Apologies that we aren’t financed by oil and have to pay #UEFA to bypass #FFP violations and sanctions.
1867 2018-11-04 19:47:02 I used stew oil

1874 2018-11-04 19:46:33 axel's so nice..! i just hope he doesn't trip over all that oil..;;
1875 2018-11-04 19:46:12 Not even remotely correct. Do you follow the Financial markets? If you did you would understand .... oil price per barrel just hit a low of $67 a barrel. So that idea of yours is not fact, it’s incorrect misinformation.
1876 2018-11-04 19:46:10 Ooooh I just looked it up and it looks right up my alley and even has jojoba oil which my skin loves. Thankssss girl 
1877 2018-11-04 19:45:48 the list of things I’ve spilled on my cats heads and lied about to cover my crimes has now expanded from just nacho cheese to include olive oil
1878 2018-11-04 19:45:42 Why is it evil to wish an end to the power gained from oil?

You just said Saudis would be just fine.

I am not hoping for famine or pain. I am just tired of the House of Saud having power based solely on the leverage achieved through fossil fuels.
1879 2018-11-04 19:45:31 I do too and this was the only one that did it, I’ve been having it for three years now. Hopefully the tea tree oil works! 
1880 2018-11-04 19:45:20 Thank you Holls Haha. Loving this with the Patchouli oil. Smells divine...
1881 2018-11-04 19:45:11 The Saudi Royals have the oil & with it the economic power. The UK & the US might "huff & puff" all they like , they wont be blowing any Saudi Royal house down soon.
1882 2018-11-04 19:45:04 Not sure what you mean but this was painted all in one layer (on top of a thin layer of paint ) so could have been done in oil or acrylic. It is actually acrylic but I could create the same effect in oil with brushes.
1883 2018-11-04 19:45:02 Lol why would you buy a big gas guzzler and live with museum tech that requires you to do extra steps all the time like going to gas stations and smog checks and oil change appointments ? Electric so much better, not just for environment reasons.
1884 2018-11-04 19:44:52 Absolutely. Sanctuary Brown needs to go. Gavin Newsom is just a yes man for Brown. Both from kept backgrounds, wealthy, Newsom. the Getty oil tycoons, Browns father was governor. I will vote for Cox as an independent. Self made lawyer. Realestate invest. And accountant.Un kept.
1885 2018-11-04 19:44:49 You need olive oil inspiration; everyone needs it! Did you know about 70% “extra virgins” at the market that are labeled as such are actually not? #fakefood #evoo #taste #realfood & let me throw this in: #VoteBlueNoMatterWho
1886 2018-11-04 19:44:28 That first day was two weeks ago and Rebecca was still there, just now she was out in the middle of an alfalfa field servicing a pivot line and smelling of sweat, oil, and grease.  At least this job kept her clear of her father.  #SundayFict
1887 2018-11-04 19:44:21 Alors, si je résume, certains prévoient de pisser dans leur réservoir pour économiser le gas oil, mais pour pisser faut boire ! Alors si le réchauffement gène les productions de whisky et de bière, on est mal là, on est très mal là ! Oh la la on es mal !
1888 2018-11-04 19:44:18 Don’t think many of these negative supporters have ever played football. FIFA 18 wizards.Starting to think the oil money very good in the English FA not only UEFA.
Inquest into referees accounts.
1889 2018-11-04 19:44:11 *checks car to see when last oil change was*
1890 2018-11-04 19:44:03 I guess she doesn’t realize the the price of oil per barrel just hit a low @around $67 a barrel. It’s Ca that ups the price!
1891 2018-11-04 19:44:01 Amazing given the fact they have the largest oil resources in the world!  Socialism breeds corruption where only a few enrich themselves on the backs of others.  Socialism can't work because it does not consider human nature and how some are corrupt at the expense of others.
1892 2018-11-04 19:43:52 when cooking Kale mix in a large amount of palm oil, it helps the kale slide into the bin easier
1893 2018-11-04 19:43:37 Almost like a typical Oilers move.
1894 2018-11-04 19:43:18 I went and got a oil change and they was asking me so many questions and i was just looking dumb as hell  like he was supposed to take my car and do this
1895 2018-11-04 19:42:59 You poured in liquor instead of oil 
1896 2018-11-04 19:42:55 God bless CBD oil. Honestly. Panic attack averted.
1897 2018-11-04 19:42:43 I just mixed CBD oil into my olive while makings hash browns/turkey bacon/eggs and boy... lemme tell you sum.... lemme tell you summmm
1898 2018-11-04 19:42:29 Look, I´m not against EV:s nor for Oil dudes. Just wanted to point out that EV is not as free of emission as we are told. It is sometehing witch will be future, right now it´s not developed enough.. yet.
1899 2018-11-04 19:42:18 ไปๆ ไปนั่งดูเฮียกะพี่นุชหวีดมั่งแซะกันมั่ง เหมือนไปดูคณะตลกที่ร้องเพลงเพราะ หนุกๆ เเค่เป็นนุช-นุชา ก็คุยกันได้ทุกคน อบอุ่นจะตาย ไม่ต้องกลัว เดวเริ่มรู้จักคนนั้นคนนี้ อยากไปก็มีคนชวนกันไปเองเเหล่ะ

1904 2018-11-04 19:41:44 Good, block me because I was just going to block you.  Oil companies get subsidies, i.e., corporate welfare, which they do not need.  They pocket it. They makes billions of dollars EVERY YEAR.  Now STFU and go away!
1905 2018-11-04 19:41:37 Even if it’s to be a camera man. I don’t mind. Those guys drink anointing oil as Elite says
1906 2018-11-04 19:41:35 Went all the way to Knoxville and @Kenji_Duhh STILL working the oil lol

1910 2018-11-04 19:40:54 Depending on the paneling you may need to use oil based kilz primer first.  I try to tint primer color room will be.  Easier to cover that way. Had water base primer work for some paneling types.  If paneling wants to bleed color through just switch to oil base
1911 2018-11-04 19:40:45 try using nail oil!!
1912 2018-11-04 19:40:37  Oil imemwagika

1916 2018-11-04 19:40:06 @onepotchef you oven chips were brilliant. They gave me an idea. Oven roasted no oil. Peeled potatoes boiled them 15 minutes put in 200c oven for 40 minutes. Great result

1923 2018-11-04 19:39:35 i’ve been doing aha bha stuff and tea tree oil so i guess i can add some sulfur stuff to that - cutting out dairy is hard but i can try it just means i’ll be nearly vegan
1924 2018-11-04 19:39:31 Well, I also voted no against the oil companies being able to drill in one's backyard -- hope you did the same:)

1927 2018-11-04 19:39:14 Cooking oil
1928 2018-11-04 19:39:11 Gotta overpower that nicotine with the .paak and/or oil  in the smokers section
1929 2018-11-04 19:39:00 The sanctions you're referring to are from 2014. Since that date, Germany particularly has been very clear that it regards sanctions on Russia as counter to its interests and is vying to import more gas and oil from Russia.
1930 2018-11-04 19:38:44 Oil spills will contaminate it.
1931 2018-11-04 19:38:40 Eat cautiously. No onions, no overly spiced food, no raw veggies. I find that I react to various frying oils. You need to test to see which irritate you. I have found that butter works best for me, or Olive oil. And no doughnuts!
1932 2018-11-04 19:38:34 The gel should be put to the pain with olive oil on the shoulder and neck
1933 2018-11-04 19:38:31 Proposal to untax crude oil for rigging companies and 0 out demand equal share to all countries.
1934 2018-11-04 19:38:28 The skin is dumb. Heard you can take it off pre-smoke. Will do that next time. 

I used olive oil + course ground pepper + kosher salt then some lemon slices half way through
1935 2018-11-04 19:38:15 Some recognition by the left that the oil industry has taken massive steps to address the safety issues raised, and some gratitude for our safe, easy lives could create an atmosphere of dialogue. Notley is my hero because she seems to recognize and try for balance.
1936 2018-11-04 19:38:13 @CiaoSamin loved your Netflix series. Bought the book, reading it now! Any thoughts on Algae oil? Would be considered neutral?
1937 2018-11-04 19:38:07 Teatree oil smells amazing
1938 2018-11-04 19:37:45 LMFAO! That's awesome. My honey thick dab oil almost always has a teensy amount of THC in it but too much and I'm laying on the floor in a full-blown panic attack. I always thought in fight or flight, I'd fight, but it's hard and I only fight in anxiety mode, not panic mode.
1939 2018-11-04 19:37:35 I wonder how much money Azerbaijan pay the EBU for membership considering they never got banned for cheating.That Swiss bank account filled to the rim with oil money. BBC's new tactic should just be cheating TBH Scrap the NF/Music video/Promo tour and buy some sims & jury votes
1940 2018-11-04 19:37:29 I saw footage of a guy sticking his hand in hot oil and pulling the food out of it and I just.... how??? HOW IS HE DOING THAT??
1941 2018-11-04 19:37:00 Last night, at like 1am, while I was doing my night time routine I knocked over a melted jar of coconut oil. It spilled all over the floor and counter. No one deserves that sort of panic.

1945 2018-11-04 19:36:35 You’ve learned what anti-frac’ers want you to think

The earthquakes were from wastewater injection. Not frac’ing. I can explain the geology if you need. 

The “chemicals” are injected into the hydrocarbon formation then pushed back out when oil is produced.
1946 2018-11-04 19:36:14 Try cbd oil robin I feel like it could really help you
1947 2018-11-04 19:36:10 How is it that the only guy Kobach/Hartman could find to endorse them publicly in a commercial is an employee of Hartman Oil and he doesn’t seem too excited about it 
1948 2018-11-04 19:36:01 Like what? Not some sketchy pipeline company offering 10% because they’re about to go under on the next oil drop is it?
1949 2018-11-04 19:35:55 You dip the whick you pay for the oil..lol..Even better I was in Belfast at Disney on ice. Any manu are shite..YNWA
1950 2018-11-04 19:35:40 In the past couple of months, the majority of men who have moved to me have said they're not looking for relationships but something fun.

I don't know what they wrote on my forehead but I'm going to buy olive oil now to rub there.

Nonsense.
1951 2018-11-04 19:35:34 @JohnJamesMI can you pls tell me your stances on energy/oil - govt reform - healthcare - also elaborate on Trumps tax reform, how you plan to address welfare/poverty, how you'll work to ensure Social Security. All of these are very vague. Also, how has Trump kept his promises?
1952 2018-11-04 19:35:34 I JUST STOCKED UP ON BAGGED ICE AND LAMP OIL ... IN CASE OF AN EXTENDED POWER OUTAGE DUE TO DICEY WEATHER MONDAY & TUESDAY !!
1953 2018-11-04 19:35:17 Peppermint oil saved us last week.
1954 2018-11-04 19:35:00 I wish, if we all paused for a moment. 
 Look at the CO2 damages cattle are making to the atmosphere .

Black fossil fuel , palm oil agriculture  et al.
Killing the planet for the white man riches.
Let go back to our ancestors , living with what Morher nature gave us.
1955 2018-11-04 19:34:53 What strength of #CBD oil would one recommend for general anxiety and restless sleep? #CannabisCommunity
1956 2018-11-04 19:34:41 Yes! It's a fact that the extra oil in my skin means I'll age better. Okay ... maybe not a fact, but I'm going with it.
1957 2018-11-04 19:34:31 more oil than the whole of East Africa
1958 2018-11-04 19:34:29 I see this happening again over oil. Without oil, we would not have our safe houses, our plentiful food, our cheap and accessible clothing, and much of our ability to communicate with the world. I would not be able to live in Edmonton because I don’t do log cabins.
1959 2018-11-04 19:34:26 Coconut oil is excellent for the cooch. Helps with ingrown hairs 
1960 2018-11-04 19:34:25 Agreed. Far from a perfect side but plenty of more upside in St. Louis and a new voice could help spark a turnaround.
1961 2018-11-04 19:34:24 and ur mind is very poor, real estate oil and gas visa agent etc thts fraud
1962 2018-11-04 19:34:24 Not sound because US is demanding unconditional surrender and regime change in a zero sum context  instead of accommodation & adaptation to benefit of all parties and the region. When US imposed an oil boycott on Japan and demanded an exit Tom China, Pearl Harbour and War ensued.
1963 2018-11-04 19:34:20 coconut oil is the love of my life 
1964 2018-11-04 19:34:02 flor con Serial Winner. Oil in Canvas. @hconvertini
1965 2018-11-04 19:33:47 You see, you start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it
1966 2018-11-04 19:33:46 Got it as loud as f**k. Gave her Kalms and cannabis oil. But she’s totally stressed 
1967 2018-11-04 19:33:27 Women and girls who need sanitary pads,the same that is beyond rich now, the poor orphaned children not in school for fees, the old granny deep in Dotito or such remote place wanting cooking oil which now costs $12 for 2litres, the unemployed youth& parent..
All victims

#looters
1968 2018-11-04 19:33:01 Horny for ripped fishnets and oil...
1969 2018-11-04 19:32:56 @RealJamesWoods why is nobody reporting that China removed its 25% tariff on oil ! Big win for the President but the MSM seems to not know! How is that possible
1970 2018-11-04 19:32:53 Old association trick used by the best snake oil salesmen.
1971 2018-11-04 19:32:52 Have people already forgotten about the snake oil stickers @goop #exploitation
1972 2018-11-04 19:32:45 My brother told me to take him to the swamp meet bc he needed oil and I’m over here thinking oil for his car, and this dude gets off at the dispensary across the street
1973 2018-11-04 19:32:40 Ааааауф Огромное спасибо это прелесть
1974 2018-11-04 19:32:31 Duke has a great Coach.. & coaches are a big deal... talent only gets you so far.. Look at Bama, Pats, Red Wings, Braves, Yankees... sometimes it’s the driver of the car, but the engine, brakes, oil, also need to work!  It’s a mix..
1975 2018-11-04 19:32:09 I’ve also tried hers and it helped me a lot more than mine did. So maybe trying different brands would help? Or looking into it in oil form!
1976 2018-11-04 19:32:08 RU has not given up on gaining ground in America. Bought up islands around Cuba and installing military bases (and 4 oil.) Just like 1962.Trump is smarter. @qanon
1977 2018-11-04 19:31:58 How do you apply it? Cause I just put it all over my lashes and I look dumb afterwards with all the oil 
1978 2018-11-04 19:31:53 Coconut oil actually has really harmful side effects for a lot of people. It does have a lot of benefits too though. For myself it works fine, but for a lot of people its harmful even if their skin is dry.
1979 2018-11-04 19:31:44 Those guys were killing each other LONG before oil was ever discovered, but the same is true in any tribal feud.
So l get that part.
(at least!)
1980 2018-11-04 19:31:41 He didn't have Austin wrapped up months ago?
1981 2018-11-04 19:31:20 I take an oil and it’s like in a dropper thing and I take a squeeze full if that makes sense! I think it also depends a lot on the brand and quality. Sam bought an oil one in Colorado for her anxiety and it’s helped her so much!
1982 2018-11-04 19:31:19 You need a high grade Indica CBD Oil. Indica goes to the body. Have same problem with my Neck. There will be times you will have to break down and take a pill still but mostly the pain can be controlled. Also try eating medibles made with Indica in conjunction.
   Peace  Y
1983 2018-11-04 19:31:08 Ima add olive oil to every dish now idc.
1984 2018-11-04 19:31:03 There is substantial evidence that this is the case - reaction to Iran, the EU's intent to begin trading for its gas and oil in euros. If there weren't concrete developments behind this then, sure, they could be dismissed. They are, however, happening.

1989 2018-11-04 19:30:19 Cool. However on a diff note. Those halogen bulbs in the new light fixture burn a LOT of energy, put out a ton of heat & burn up easily. When you replace the bulbs, use a gloved hand or a paper towel. Don't touch with fingers. Oil will cause hot spots, burn out faster.
1990 2018-11-04 19:30:10 the oil companies would not like this free fuel....
1991 2018-11-04 19:30:08 Did they discover cooking oil or crude oil
1992 2018-11-04 19:29:57 石油[タンク]︰an oil [tank]
1993 2018-11-04 19:29:56 I love how valvoline shows me what the oil looks like after an oil change and I always say it looks great when in fact I have no clue what I’m looking at. 
1994 2018-11-04 19:29:49 You render the chorizo and sear the scallops in that oil. Really helps the color and adds great flavor.
1995 2018-11-04 19:29:46 @danintheoutback You are a writer? I see no facts. Just repeating slogans.  Back up your stories with data.  What brought Venezuela down? It has huge oil and gold resources. You say the US. Prove it.
1996 2018-11-04 19:29:44 i make coconut oil and soon will be distributing coconut water. Maybe we can do great things together. Novos me if your interested:)
1997 2018-11-04 19:29:39 WTF are you talking about? How did he save America? What threat was America facing? All those soldiers fought for oil and the profits of the military industrial complex. THOSE are the facts. Crenshaw got a purple heart because he was injured in combat, not for saving America.
1998 2018-11-04 19:29:37 Garlic infused olive oil on popcorn is just wow 
1999 2018-11-04 19:29:32 None of this is accounted for in carbon footprint. EV'S break the oil energy chain and will rapidly advance renewable energy production and micro grids.

Those of us who get the value of a renewable economy hang with Musk because he's the ONLY one actually getting things done.
2000 2018-11-04 19:29:27 No thanks to you.
Americans are uninformed and misinformed. 
You think this might cause them to make the wrong decision in direct contradiction to their best interests bcse they are ignorant or swayed by biased parties motivated by self intrest?
2001 2018-11-04 19:29:25 Kuna mbavuuu mmoja alikua anasema konkii alikua anafukuzia sasa naanza amini. But doesnt make the ones mentioned clean dhoo  wote oil chafuuu tu
2002 2018-11-04 19:29:19 Switched to CBD capsules. Took a 50mg one about an hour ago after waking up with my back being insanely tight & uncomfortable. 1hr later, pain is 90% gone. Thank you CBD oil !
2003 2018-11-04 19:29:12 @realDonaldTrump is entertainment 4 his base He says what they R afraid 2 say in public He gets cheers/applause He is a carney hawker He is a liar He is like the snake oil salesman who cons ppl 2 get their $ In any other time he would B a distraction Now though he is a danger
2004 2018-11-04 19:29:10 That's got to be rough. You must be fighting constantly against old wives tales and snake oil medicine. You have my sympathies
2005 2018-11-04 19:29:04 Commie CH_  used its lending power (saved through currency manipulations) to entrap desperate Venezuela,Brazil, and add bases and get their oil. @qanon
2006 2018-11-04 19:28:56 Get some CBD oil.  Vets have used it to get off of opiates.  The strongest is derived from Canabis sativa not hemp.  It will help like magic and your head will be clear.
2007 2018-11-04 19:28:46 China has REMOVED its 25% tariff on oil ! Big Win for the President but nobody in MSM even knows about it. Hmmm
2008 2018-11-04 19:28:46 oil tycoon 
2009 2018-11-04 19:28:40 Best interest at heart? Please. Anyone with a working brain knows that the ONLY thing that the US is after is the Venezuela LARGEST OIL RESERVE in the entire PLANET pal.
2010 2018-11-04 19:28:26 OK, I'm no longer claiming to be a futurist/game-changer/disruptor/change-agent/trhought-leader/snake-oil-salesperson. I'm now an off-air lifestyle expert/coach. (Unreasonable rates still apply.)
2011 2018-11-04 19:28:26 Women swear they be havin big dick energy when they know how to change the oil on a car lol
2012 2018-11-04 19:28:23 Socialist democrats can shift and slide their narrative quicker than a snake oil peddler. Its all the left has to offer, snake oil policy of socialism.
Stay engaged Patriots
2013 2018-11-04 19:28:20 its ok brother, i can't explain any better than that. The wars in Middle east will continue long after the whole of earth has electric cars, one day you will understand who is fueling the fire and it was never about the oil, it took me a very long time too, so its ok.
2014 2018-11-04 19:28:18 Achilles heal for china, no oil, not enough food production.
2015 2018-11-04 19:28:18 Hillary and Yvette are part of what we will call the Intergalactic Team. We’re not extracting oil on planets we colonise. We will have nature reserves for the local wildlife. But we have to save this planet first. Ironically a donation won’t help, sharply stopping them will.
2016 2018-11-04 19:28:16 No sir . Stew oil

2019 2018-11-04 19:27:50 Also clove oil, salt, and warm water rinse is saving my life.
2020 2018-11-04 19:27:35 I need an oil change.
2021 2018-11-04 19:27:30 Simon Kukes is an oil magnate with ties to Intrator and Vekselberg
Kukes joined one of the largest oil companies in Russia, Yukos Oil
In 2016, Kukes contributed $283,000 to the Trump Victory Fund

Blavatnik, Intrater, Alexander Shustorovich and Kukes gave $10.4M

2024 2018-11-04 19:27:03 And that’s why you do oil changes yourself lol
2025 2018-11-04 19:27:03 Them oil pens clutch af  
2026 2018-11-04 19:26:48 Um, how did that happen? Do I want to even know? Peanut butter, regular butter, or coconut oil help.
2027 2018-11-04 19:26:38 CBD hemp oil stops the arguments i have with myself in my head.
2028 2018-11-04 19:26:32 That’s fair but, my point is he’s trying to keep oil prices reasonable for all of us. If that wasn’t the case then he’d be doing all he could to encourage cuts in production.

2030 2018-11-04 19:26:20 Groundnut oil, palm oil, melted shea butter, coconut oil, almond oil, OILY OIL,... which one did you use and which do you recommend? 
2031 2018-11-04 19:26:16 Upward. Is it still upward.

Which crude oil?  SE?

A nation can do harness its resources without neglecting another.

Imagine a nation of 68yrs putting its agricultural potential in order just 5yrs ago.
2032 2018-11-04 19:26:16 Fallout of #ImranKhan's disappointing Chinese visit is more exploitation of #Balochistan. Evan Saudi's package, asks Pakistan to explore oil reserves of Balochistan with subsidiaries of Saudi Oil Companies. Has Imran explained all this to its people? At the cost of #Balochs?
2033 2018-11-04 19:26:10 Truth is, I still have my old pillows with the black cases. It’ll make an appearance at bed time so I don’t mistakenly rub off oil in my hair on this. Also addicted to my weighted blanket, so this duvet na fancy.

2035 2018-11-04 19:25:36 Sleep paralysis is scary af. It happened to me one time in school. I thought I was dying. Happened to my roommate too and we rushed to buy anointing oil the next day, we thought it was a spiritual attack 
2036 2018-11-04 19:25:29 I'm happy with the light in the shadows in this one. Come to the gallery for "All Around the Town" . Paintings in watercolour, oil, acrylic, and pastel. 
2037 2018-11-04 19:25:26 Dark Inventory can be anywhere. Economic interest in oil is simply opaquely sold & repurchased. Remember Enron? They invented this technique. Similar games go on with gold & base metals.
2038 2018-11-04 19:25:11 No thanks. My property taxes are high enough. Tax oil companies instead. #drew4oklahoma
2039 2018-11-04 19:24:50 Classic FM has definitely worked for our dog, along with Karma Wrap, Xanax, Calmex and lavender oil. Last nights program with Bill was excellent, could do with it being aired tonight and tomorrow too
2040 2018-11-04 19:24:50 Gavecal  ... if and when the following happens: 
#SaudiArabia Arabia adopts the renminbi for oil payments  Germany changes its stripes and cozies up to #Russia and pretty much gives up on the whole Eu integration charade in order to  self-interest...
2041 2018-11-04 19:24:48 Politicians encouraged folks to buy houses. Spoke about money #cascading down through the generations. 
My parents went bankrupt, their house was in negative equity. I’m still paying off the debt years later!
I wish a vat of hot oil would cascade onto those politicians!

2042 2018-11-04 19:24:32 That smoke is normal, just oil burning off in the exhaust
2043 2018-11-04 19:24:14 Never suggested it was and am aware of that but none of that changes the fact 3 earned runs over six innings isn't a quality start.
2044 2018-11-04 19:24:14 One must also remember the simple & spiritual leader who was raised with the diet of garlic, bread and yogurt all his life, who went on to challenge the Satanic, greedy America in order 2 save Iran's wealth of oil. Otherwise, they wld have been a puppet like the Saudis #Khomeni
2045 2018-11-04 19:24:14 Rural Canada is a small factor.  And yes we can largely eliminate oil for fuel
2046 2018-11-04 19:24:07 I don’t know where. No one I know has gotten any pay raise. Did see BP oil made 1 trillion dollars in profits just this quarter thanks to GOPTAXSCAM tax cuts for billionaires and corporations

2049 2018-11-04 19:23:41 Psalm (KJV) 23:5 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
23:6 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.
2050 2018-11-04 19:23:29 I realize that countries don’t start pumping more oil because someone tweeted that they should.
2051 2018-11-04 19:23:24 Support grass roots football. Once the Sky money & oil money are gone, you'll need to find a new team to support #FootballLeaks @DerSPIEGEL
2052 2018-11-04 19:23:18 Thank you for this response! I ask this in particular because of Iraq's case, where they do not have the excess food and medicine to exchange for Iranian oil.
2053 2018-11-04 19:23:15 Oil chafu 
2054 2018-11-04 19:23:09 Not sure where you're going with this.
The 'Middle East' is the oil field of the world. They have nothing else.
So where does "serving your ethnic nation" come in when the companies are foreign, and the local pols bought & paid for?
You DO know the petrodollar is dying, right?
2055 2018-11-04 19:22:58 Well with the "support", our Agric output started to take an upward turn in the past 5years... It's not impressive but it's a start.. 

Abandoning it for another "crude oil" isn't the key...
2056 2018-11-04 19:22:57 45 is so tied into saudi arabia we will never have a full investigation into murder of journalist.
what to bet sanctions against iran/iraq will result in increased saudi oil sales to us?
2057 2018-11-04 19:22:44 Don't you know, ted is known for using edited propaganda films to support his lies

You can smell his desperation and it stinks to high heaven, worse than an oil field on a hot August summer day

He's freaking out about #RepublicansForBeto 
2058 2018-11-04 19:22:39 Oil is mined our of the ground, transported refined using massive amounts of energy and water and produces toxic waste bi- products. Then transported again in pipelines that massively pollute our landscape and water. 

Oil companies foster wars that Lil and displace millions. 1/

2062 2018-11-04 19:22:02 That's not surprising. They aren't getting the money from the tree huggers so they have to get money from oil and gas. Apparently morals don't matter as long as your paid
2063 2018-11-04 19:21:44 Nov 4th 2018 is a day of starting oil sanctions of Iran 
But remember Nov 4th of 1979 
It was day of U.S embassy siege in Iran. 
But remember #MEK or #PMOI or mujahedin_e_khalgh was the main operator of those ! 

#MIGA_RESTART
2064 2018-11-04 19:21:33 I’m sure Adam will.  I use James Martin. My trick is not just making sure the oil is smoking hot but chilling the batter mix for an hour beforehand.  Probably more sacrilege but works for me.
2065 2018-11-04 19:21:31 You do realize that President Trump tweeted not long ago about crude oil prices being too high, don’t you? He chastised Saudi Arabia for trying to cut production which would cause the price to rise. As a result, they stopped. It’s a win for all of us.

Your leadership is murderous and cruel. I look forward to the day renewable energy replaces oil so that the Saud family becomes powerless.

2088 2018-11-04 19:18:06 I really think that's a great thing, and it should be explored and utilized to the fullest. Currently, however, it's a good thing for people to understand that it's not only fuel that oil is used for! Even if it is a small percentage :)
2089 2018-11-04 19:17:59 • apply castor oil and olive oil or vaseline to your lashes and brows every night

2092 2018-11-04 19:17:34 decided to add some oil to my foundation and omg. 
2093 2018-11-04 19:17:30 Agree with ending oil subsidies (and corporate subsidies altogether) since they are only tools for politicians to reward or punish people, depending on how much they contribute. But you can't force a non-economically viable tech on a market. It will distort the market & fail.

2104 2018-11-04 19:16:30 Today, 95% of hydrogen is produced either from wood or from fossil fuels, such as natural gas and oil.  The most common hydrogen production process is natural gas reforming, sometimes called steam methane reforming because it uses high-temperature steam.#zerosum

2106 2018-11-04 19:16:27 That’s great the secret with the pasta is using a heavy pan I use olive oil and a dollop of butter to slowly fry the chicken then add finely chopped onions then the peppers with plenty of oregano & then the tomatoes and garlic etc 
2107 2018-11-04 19:16:26 Speaking of Canada, thank you to @jjhorgan and @AJWVictoriaBC for helping the Texas oil economy! By killing or stalling the Trans Mountain pipeline, Canadians sell more oil at a discount to the US market, instead getting premium prices on the Asian Market! #BigOil #CruzCrew
2108 2018-11-04 19:16:24 You do not get an argument from me about how high our CO2 levels are building.  
We cannot eliminate oil.  
Rural Canada will not have their vehicles powered by electricity for a long, long time. Maybe we should plant more trees or stop deforestation.

2126 2018-11-04 19:14:36 The "process" folks. Pegulas, Beane, and McDermott are all fraudulent snake oil salesmen for scamming Bills fans out of their money this year.
2127 2018-11-04 19:14:30 Why did you repeatedly block Weilechowski’s motions to restore the pfd?   Honestly I’d prefer a governor who’s working to protect the corpus rather than a handout.  Oil will run out and with out better fiscal ideas than anyone has put forward education and public safety will die
2128 2018-11-04 19:14:28 Olive oil on babies head for 15 minutes then take a soft bristle brush and brush it off then wash. Shouldn’t have to do it more than twice but if you have to, do it once a week.
2129 2018-11-04 19:14:17 This is what AB needs - release from boom bust economy of oil ! Rachel don’t drag it back by hyping the Trans Mtn pipeline. It’s bad for AB & Canada & our climate commitment. AB is resourceful

2144 2018-11-04 19:12:46 i could argue progressive candidates are thinking too long term, not too short term. in an ideal world, where oil companies do not exist, progressive policies would be kings, sitting in the effort minimum, where oil companies now sit. short term, we need to collapse the oil econ.

2147 2018-11-04 19:12:17 America doesn't need more drug abuse. Test the safety & effectiveness of CBD oil derived from cannabis that's had the thc engineered so low that you can't get high on it, to see if it's medicinally useful. Recreational use is a mistake.

2149 2018-11-04 19:12:03 USA should leave IRAN alone man, Iran is facing such economic issues because of USA, they will not get the Oil they should just give up.

2151 2018-11-04 19:11:47 It's like turning around an oil tanker. Austerity has bitten hard and it will take a while to put thing right....
2152 2018-11-04 19:11:45 It is your fault you are trying to talk with a retarded person here. He says Erdogan not so much with absolutely no evidence to back up their claim. These are the people who orchestra coups left and right all around the world staging wars to extract oil from poor countries
2153 2018-11-04 19:11:43 Not anymore, I usually put two drops of tea tree oil and eucalyptus

I've been using the balm on my knee,works better than the tablets I was on,capsules and a few drops morning and night
Thanks to @CBD_Support
2157 2018-11-04 19:11:34 It’s been so long since I’ve been to a nightclub I thought the shot girl was offering samples of olive oil to try last night. Then the lack of bread gave it away
2158 2018-11-04 19:11:21 3) It is the nature of ZPF to be corrupt. They could have engaged with a reputable investor for the oil but alas they are planning to bring in some amateur who has no experience & not known. Do they learn from the Chiyadzwa debacle? No they don't bcoz it is all about themselves.

2163 2018-11-04 19:10:55 Crude oil has other products other than petrol.
2164 2018-11-04 19:10:52 wasn`t the Iran oil ban suppose to take full effect TODAY
2165 2018-11-04 19:10:49 i need oil :/
2166 2018-11-04 19:10:31 Then let’s cut subsidies altogether till the winners shake out. Penalize oil for its pollution and force the big guys to get on board with solar.  Adapt or die shouldn’t just apply to the little guy.

2170 2018-11-04 19:09:10 Exactly. How about solar wind and water instead of coal oil and gas?
2171 2018-11-04 19:08:59 Blocked again @ACommonSenseWay
Yes, this IS what happens when the Wall St. propaganda convinces brainwashed fools to believe trickledown economics, Saudi Oil wars and poison air are good for them. Stop living in fear and blocking #truthtellers like @HempFarmOrg you Fascist pussy!
2172 2018-11-04 19:08:49 Obama's cabinet was vetted by Citibank, Hillary got tons of cash from Goldman Sachs and she also was a huge supporter of the Keystone pipeline until it was inconvenient. Lets not forget that Warren Buffet a huge liberal also owns a railway that makes tons of cash transporting oil
2173 2018-11-04 19:08:40 expectation level is super high. We are playing against in a league where 1 team is funded by an oil rich state and has cheated their way to 3 titles. I’m sad that we have been cheated once out a title and most likely will be again.
2174 2018-11-04 19:08:38 And horizontal drilling wasn’t there plus those price of oil was $25pbland back then gas wasn’t as big as it is today coz of global warming
2175 2018-11-04 19:08:26 Despite how the Saudis frame it, KSA needs the US more than the US needs them. The Saudis really only bring oil and headaches to the table...

2177 2018-11-04 19:07:49 Think I Should Get A Hot Oil Treatment Before I Get My Braids Cause They Staying In Till February 20th 
2178 2018-11-04 19:07:41 Kale's awesome. I like to stir fry it in a tiny bit of oil with bacon bits, cubes of apple and thyme, then pour in some cider and cook it until it's all wilted and yummy.

And now I'm craving that....
2179 2018-11-04 19:07:32 I love my Jamaican Black Castor oil. And every time I wear it I always get compliments on how good I smell 
2180 2018-11-04 19:07:15 @MariaBartiromo Futures show this morning JAW dropping with Larry Kudlow about China possibly purchasing OIL from the USA and NOT Iran! If @realDonaldTrump can pull this Trade Deal off it will be “Amazing” “Epic” “Big League” however the Congress will hold the VOTE to Accept
2181 2018-11-04 19:07:14 Yes Donald there is alot of energy in America and it's not coming from gas or oil, Its coming from ELECTRIC so don't #GoBlue GO GREEN.
2182 2018-11-04 19:07:12 2) I don't think ZPF has interest in national building bt protecting their loot & themselves. ED squandered many chances of engagement with opposition deliberately. ZPF loves absolute power but as we know it corrupts. Now the newly discovered oil is already problem can u imagine
2183 2018-11-04 19:07:06 How marvellous, What a wonderful organisation. So well deserved.
2184 2018-11-04 19:06:56 On it
2185 2018-11-04 19:06:50 And on that basis there *are* bigger differences between US states - but there's much less pattern to them than the UK's London/not-London divide (though the richest states *are* mostly in the northeast, with the exception of two states with small populations and lots of oil/gas)
2186 2018-11-04 19:06:42 
2187 2018-11-04 19:06:33 Oh, so many ways: lunch at a healthy restaurant, mocktails with a friend, pedicure, a massage, binge watching a Netflix series, avocado oil chips (I tell myself they’re healthy), living room picnic or outdoor picnic if you live somewhere warm, reading a detective novel, Yahtzee!

Rice? Beans? Palm oil?

2193 2018-11-04 19:05:49 They want the power and profit from oil, thats how they control us by the use of energy. Energy is power, energy is continued existance. Without energy we are powerless and will soon perish. The wheel didn't come first, fire did.

2200 2018-11-04 19:05:18 We need to boycott their oil because if their tendency to murder journalists and dissenters.

2202 2018-11-04 19:05:09 This your stew oil self
2203 2018-11-04 19:05:08 The Lord replied to them:
“I am sending you grain, new wine and olive oil,
    enough to satisfy you fully;
never again will I make you
    an object of scorn to the nations.
2204 2018-11-04 19:05:02 Oil change?
2205 2018-11-04 19:04:57 I mean.. you can make hair conditioner naturally with some olive oil and honey and eggs, actually. It's kinda neat.
2206 2018-11-04 19:04:34 They are oil or alcohol soluble. But oil and water do not mix. So if your distillate is oil based it will not mix with water based vodka. Easy to make a tincture by putting dried buds directly in the vodka and straining after several weeks.
2207 2018-11-04 19:04:33 Yes and from a baseball standpoint, it has become less and less of an actual thing, Not sure how 3 earned runs in six innings should be considered a quality start. Decent sure but not quality.
2208 2018-11-04 19:04:16 yes, Richard Perle, Paul Wolfowitz, Douglas Feith, William Kristol, Eliot Abrams, Charles Krauthammer all wanted that Iraq oil when US has the largest oil producer Saudi Arabia in its pocket and lord knows how much reserves on the homeland
2209 2018-11-04 19:04:15 Like mixing oil and vinegar,  no matter how hard you try it will never blend.
2210 2018-11-04 19:04:08 I agree. The worst thing Bush did was respond to 9/11 by attacking Afghanistan then going to war in Iraq for oil. Then torturing pow's. Bush/Cheney should be in the Hague for war crimes.
2211 2018-11-04 19:04:02 oh don't worry once they discover we have oil , then we could truly get LIBERATED
2212 2018-11-04 19:04:01 Oil money speaks 
2213 2018-11-04 19:03:59 2nd Factor
Oil discoveries = supply increase = price drop.
FDI could help
With cash & kind investment, those looking to gain from discovery of oil must invest in other sectors, possibly through a government programme
The Gov. partners with investors & reinvests in other sectors.

2230 2018-11-04 19:02:07 Not particularly. One, a goaltender can have a great night and late meaningless goal can turn it into a "non-quality start". Second, the volume of shots/saves isn't always the way to determine if a goalie had a good night or not. It's far too vague.
2231 2018-11-04 19:02:05 Oh boy ye,I been enter Dubai this year May,when I saw what oil money,the same oil money Nigeria has,is doing for that country ehn,I literally wept...we re doomed in Nigeria,its a failed lawless jungle.

2249 2018-11-04 18:59:25 Well if it ain't about oil, wtf ELSE is there? 
Sand & camels?

| Exfoiliate your skin only once a week. If you do it more than that you'll strip your skin of its natural oil

| Use tea tree oil at nights on pimples

| Give your skin a break from harsh chemicals. Eg: makeup

| Don't use oil as an moisturizer. Buy an oil free one

2280 2018-11-04 18:55:12 Are you aware of the UK regulations on the extracted water?  I don't think you find much salt in oil/gas bearing shale?  What quantities are you talking about?  Much of our food is contaminated with the same including radioactive isotopes.
2281 2018-11-04 18:55:11 This hot oil treatment, and doing my hair before work, may be a little ambitious...but I love a challenge! lol
2282 2018-11-04 18:55:02 If there is a more irrelevant stat for goaltenders, not exactly sure what it would be.
2283 2018-11-04 18:55:00 Had a recent conversation with someone who had some great ideas for an Alberta First approach to getting our oil to market. This is probably an idea who's time has come.
2284 2018-11-04 18:54:51 Exxon's annual revs exceed the total value of total trade btw the US and UK - c 280 billion. Yet they sought out a kid in his 20s to secure oil gas concessions.
2285 2018-11-04 18:54:41 That's okay. The extra oil in our skin means we age better. 
2286 2018-11-04 18:54:38 Man said he was so high he got the oil changed on a rental car
2287 2018-11-04 18:54:32 Every other good clip youve seen is probably on the same old oil depot map so i could see confusion.

2289 2018-11-04 18:54:30 Lol United are paying Martial £70k per week and paying Alexis £350k per week + £75k match bonus. Looks like the Chilean Bolasie negotiated his contract with a horn and palm oil on his tongue. Can't be ordinary.
2290 2018-11-04 18:54:27 I don't bother with ratios, unfortunately- but more apricot jam than soy sauce/oil etc.
2291 2018-11-04 18:54:17 is this oil pastels I like it
2292 2018-11-04 18:54:14 We don’t even change our own car engine oil! I cant imagine eschewing professional help where death is a very possible outcome.
2293 2018-11-04 18:54:02 Part may be due to resourced moving toward "oil discovery activity".
Growth is based on projections of current activity.  
Oil is discovered.
Resources are moved to oil.
The other sectors suffer.
One institutional provision: use oil revenue to sustain other sector growth.

2306 2018-11-04 18:51:51 They also failed to increase the NI pot at the same time costing all of us but not them.. 219 billion at last count lost contributions. They also squandered our oil wealth unlike Norway who used it to set up a sovereign fund...
2307 2018-11-04 18:51:49 Nah, we just reject Islam. Matthew 7:6. Besides if it wasn’t for oil, Mohammedans wouldn’t be expanding & building mosques, they’d be just trying to survive in a tent in the desert. Exactly why we need alternatives to oil now, not later.

2333 2018-11-04 18:49:27 As usual, you are both measured and correct Sire. Simply going negative on any policy re: climate change is not a winner, or is not having a policy a policy itself?

2350 2018-11-04 18:46:46 Oh and olive oil (duh but it’s so good to bring out all the nutrients from the tomatoes) and wait for it.... a tbs of brown sugar near the end  trust me.
2351 2018-11-04 18:46:32 I didn’t gain an hour sleep last night. Instead, I was hit with severe insomnia. My body feels it today. Thank goodness for essential oils, CBD oil, herbs, books, and hot medicinal tea. Today’s focus is self-care!
2352 2018-11-04 18:46:31 Olive &amp; almond oil are rich in essential fatty acids which help strengthen dry &amp; cracked nails

2354 2018-11-04 18:46:20 Overdone Yorkshire puds, and spuds look like they’ve been roasted in oil, instead of properly with lard or some other animal fat. But I’d elope with that pork.
2355 2018-11-04 18:46:15 Carter was antithesis of big oil, reagan bribed khomeini and big oil had their champion. Crazy radicals do not need western triggers. They create their own trump like fear tactics
2356 2018-11-04 18:46:13 My girl literally asked me why I’m putting groundnut oil while cooking white rice and I calmly explained to her. She just said “ko ni da fun Segun”. She said Segun is her Ex who would have insulted her for asking such question. You guys should try abeg, we are losing them girls
2357 2018-11-04 18:46:13 I use alot of olive oil, coconut for baking/substitute for butter, and I love avocado oil! Wish I had some rn.

2359 2018-11-04 18:45:51 Gee...oil can be used as a bait?  Trump might get lots of stupid fish!  Lol. :)
2360 2018-11-04 18:45:47 Doubtful the oil co's will pay. Likely the pro-business small gov't fiercely independent Albertans will leave this to future governments while wondering why they pay taxes. Even more likely they'll stick it to the Fed gov't while complaining Canada does nothing for them.
2361 2018-11-04 18:45:36 I need to make time to braid myself my hair is getting so dry and I’m getting too lazy to wash n maintain it. In braids I know I will just spray it with water mixed with caster oil

2364 2018-11-04 18:45:21 Hmm, as I previously said, CBD oil is working well, keeping our dogs calm, despite noisy fireworks outside - but I'm sitting here in a seriously stressed.

2382 2018-11-04 18:43:28 In geological terms, Carbon is renewable. It gets taken from the air by plants, plants die, the hydrocarbons they create seep into the ground, and collect in the oil equivalent of aquifers which is exactly where the oil and gas we drill comes from. The solids become coal

2385 2018-11-04 18:43:08 Good to see my state is a laughing stock of democracy. But they don't care. Trump set the bar so low that you have to call 811 before you dig lest you hit the bar.

The only way we're going to find the bar again is if they convince the oil barons to drill for it offshore.

2429 2018-11-04 18:39:36 Hannity is a carnival barker. Trump is a louder carnival barker. They are all selling snake oil by the barrel.
2430 2018-11-04 18:39:33 This should not surprise you. In Venezuela, with more reserves of oil, second in gas and gold and excellent position in Coltan, Venezuelans feed once a day, m many die because of lack of medication
2431 2018-11-04 18:39:26 Even this weekend. We need a potato peeler, a chipper a deep frier, chips spice and lots of cooking oil

2446 2018-11-04 18:37:55 The choice is simple and clear - Cruz for senate. Texas is an oil country, no oil workers should want to vote for Beto, Beto voted to add $10 tax on every barrel of oil produced.

2457 2018-11-04 18:36:28 Haslam needs to stay off the sideline and stop interfering with footbalk operations since he's clueless what it takes to win.  Go back to screwing people over at the oil company and stay away from out Browns?

Whether it's Oil & Gas, Mining, I.T, Banking, Life Sciences, etc etc it's better to be an expert in 1 area than skin deep in 20 different sectors. Ref old book "Zulu Principle"

2473 2018-11-04 18:33:52 I love #onions and #garlic. Cooked in good-quality olive oil, they most definitely improve the flavor of a meal; and the aroma that is emitted through the kitchen / house is wonderful.

2477 2018-11-04 18:33:32 Maybe I'm a terrible person for saying this but what I see in these pictures is an opportunity to pick up hundreds of these people at a time to send them back to their homelands where they can live off the wealthy oil rich Sheikhs.

2486 2018-11-04 18:32:41 This statement took tremendous courage insofar as Iran has threatened swift annihilation of all of its neighbors if the oil embargo is enforced.

2488 2018-11-04 18:32:37 Give me a break! How many Americans live in Iraq? After we deposed Saddam Hussein who was a psycho murder who invaded Kuwait w/desires to dominate their oil reserves the country fell into chaos because of the waring factions of Islam! Don’t blame us for saving the world economy!
2489 2018-11-04 18:32:22 How come when I buy CBD gummies from the gas station I feel awesome and relaxed for 5-6 hours. When I buy the oil it takes a lot of oil & doesn't last nearly as long. (Many different brands) these gummies are awesome. Or laced. . .

2498 2018-11-04 18:30:48 Alaskans own 65,000 shares of CENTENNIAL RESOURCE DEVELOPMEN, worth $1,184,950. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in UNITED STATES.
2499 2018-11-04 18:30:38 So are these $15 an hour jobs because we all know with the cost of everything going up and additional taxation these are not sustainable jobs. What about Calgary? Male unemployment stats 15%. You Yahoo's that are clucking about the"Oil sands" sure like every thing it provides
2500 2018-11-04 18:30:32 It was about not paying in US$, but yes: it was about the oil.

2502 2018-11-04 18:30:23 Funny you didn’t bother to show up for native Americans when they were being brutalized for protecting their water from oil pipelines.

I’m not a republican, but I really hope you LOSE.  You’re a  disgusting evil, greedy woman.

2507 2018-11-04 18:29:12 Barry Jenkins used rosehip oil on actors to capture reflected skin surfaces on MOONLIGHT 
This was after doing tests on different oils. 
(cc: skincare girls, who already knew this stuff is gold.)
2508 2018-11-04 18:29:11 Have read this earlier... it was just talks no white paper. I came to know even nda bought oil bonds in 98-2004 , paid by upa later but again no proof.
2509 2018-11-04 18:29:06 Skinnel and coconut oil
2510 2018-11-04 18:29:00 hello yes i would like an oil change coupon @jiffylube @SearsAuto @pepboysauto @CastrolUSA
2511 2018-11-04 18:28:55 I take it this is a pro union parody account? We have plenty oil in the Clyde, unfortunately there were to many mugs voting no, which means we are unable to drill there as we are forced to keep fucking trident there! I don't think you will get independence from Scotland as UK 1/2
2512 2018-11-04 18:28:55 Don't think it's bout oil, per se, but that they don't want to pay in $.
(Think lraq, Lybia, etc)
Not to worry: Venezuela has gold, China the Yuan 2-step, & the Bear? Vlad the Patient; pissing himself laughing at all those pissants & finding his own in the fkn Siberian outback.
2513 2018-11-04 18:28:54 Well, I'd suggest that if they want to 'Follow The Money' - they take a good hard look at the oil industry and their lobbying efforts and successes. Trying to find anti-climate change papers that don't trace back to them is a fools errand.

2515 2018-11-04 18:28:48 Electricity is the cleanest solution so far. I don't see anything that can compete. Energy storage gets cleaner then there isn't an argument. 
Hydrogen is a slave fuel, so is crude oil. Electricity is the least so IMO because it can be made in so many ways
2516 2018-11-04 18:28:46 Why are couples in engagement photo shoots always cooking in their underwear? HOT OIL people

Heading to the great state of Texas! Under republican leadership and mostly thanks to #realDonaldTrump, They are the worlds third largest producer of oil: 1. USA 2. Russia 3. Texas 4. Obama’s favorite country, Iran God bless Texas!
2520 2018-11-04 18:27:57 Hey...

that guy is using water on an oil fire...

Once you build it, please fire him
2521 2018-11-04 18:27:57 Still not cheaper to shut down coal and oil but it will be, building a brand new coal plant is vastly more expensive than building wind turbines or solar cells.
2522 2018-11-04 18:27:42 Growing beard, life lo first time beard oil koni apply chesa pic thesi post cheste block cheyyaru kada 
2523 2018-11-04 18:27:40 All forms of clean energy are now cheaper to produce then both oil and coal, when it comes to building a new infastructure.
2524 2018-11-04 18:27:35 Jojoba, almond, argan, avocado, coconut, and rose hip oil.
2525 2018-11-04 18:27:27 That’s like waiting for teleportation before you drive. We subsidize clean energy rather than oil and it would take off. Solar and wind could cut costs and help with pollution.  We absolutely need regulations.  Companies are fine with damaging our health if the numbers are right.
2526 2018-11-04 18:27:21 true,  oil frauds hahaha #GGMU

2528 2018-11-04 18:27:17 Just what I was telling a friend at the viewing centre...that oil too much abeg
2529 2018-11-04 18:27:07 coffee kinda taste like motor oil but i kinda like it..
2530 2018-11-04 18:27:02 Only turnover that city is generating is through tv money. That's the perk of playing football in PL. It has global reach & mass following. Every club earns that. The amt of money depends on where club finish in table. City is able to finish higher coz of oil money.
2531 2018-11-04 18:26:13 มาเช็ดน้ำตากูเลยงี้
2532 2018-11-04 18:26:09 Oil and coal are trying to hold on because we are at their will.  If you put a wind turbine in your yard, solar panels on your home, and a battery backup in your garage, you eliminate the need for government intervention or the dependency of a separate entity.
2533 2018-11-04 18:25:53 That's not a surprise. 80% of our energy comes from fossil fuels. Established oil corporations have more money to donate than fledgling green energy companies.
2534 2018-11-04 18:25:47 The face oil is phenomenal!
2535 2018-11-04 18:25:24 It was a premade one and it's amazing, unfortunately largely down to huge amounts of palm oil
2536 2018-11-04 18:25:24 This whole beard situation is becoming serious. Now using beard shampoo and oil #Teenwolf
2537 2018-11-04 18:25:20 Note the price of a litre of fuel has dropped 2p in U.K.Russia increasing oil output,good old Puty ya beauty..unlike Saudi that decrease output on US orders to increase the price...come on you Brits who do you think your real foes are?
2538 2018-11-04 18:25:16 Can't imagine what we're trying to accomplish here. What is our environment minister doing there? Lecturing on coal? (But now she likes coal.) Lecturing on oil? (But China wants to buy oil.) Think Chinese officials would like her to go home so they can get on with their day.
2539 2018-11-04 18:25:14 To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified.

2540 2018-11-04 18:25:10 I hear CBD oil is great though and def ask your mum to pray for you. That always helps. Meditation is keyyy, observing what happens and what you're thinking when it happens lets you know what triggers it, time yourself for 10 min stillness daily and see after a week
2541 2018-11-04 18:25:09 GREAT. thanks for that, Will.
2542 2018-11-04 18:25:04 We need unfettered access to cheap Canadian oil to usher in an era of unprecedented Canadian prosperity. Not a carbon tax that makes it harder for me to heat my home.
2543 2018-11-04 18:25:03 That’s what i use my tea tree oil for son
2544 2018-11-04 18:24:54 But that requires a much deeper philosophical debate. We are simply not reacting to pollution oil wars arms trade renewable energy etc GP is incapable of representing the urgent need to shed bogus eurogreen dogmas.
2545 2018-11-04 18:24:47 Whether people are working for the state or private business (or coops), it is important to produce as much as possible within the currency borders, and have a diverse economy, so an oil price drop affecting imports
Won't mean money chasing less real stuff
therefore inflation
2546 2018-11-04 18:24:41 Cont.) Iran must without delay get out of this nefarious #IranDeal. This Deal is a recipe for disaster for Iran, socially, economically and industrially: the IranDeal as the EU is proposing will keep Iran in a state of hibernation, and amounts to an 'oil for food programme'.

2550 2018-11-04 18:23:37 Guys, is olive oil and cooking oil same?

2552 2018-11-04 18:23:26 We did that in the 70’s during the oil embargo. It was awful, especially where winters are hard. The worst was kids waiting for school buses in the dark. Farmers with livestock really hated it. Why it was abandoned after one winter.
2553 2018-11-04 18:23:20 Republicans pollute the world with oil and coal....even as a Christmas gift. Dumb. #GOP Governers now start immitate childish #Trump behaviour aswel? #midterms
2554 2018-11-04 18:23:02 Oil is absolutely essential to almost all our endeavors in this time period
2555 2018-11-04 18:22:59 Currently making a pasta sauce with tomatoes, spinach, onion, sausages, garlic and lots of other goodies. Planning to let it cook on a low heat for an hour or so, then add some cream, pesto and olive oil.. but it's smelling so damn good I'm having trouble waiting..
2556 2018-11-04 18:22:42 im sorry for arab's country and iran, when they can live with each other like a brothers,in flag of profit Mohamad , but........,please understanding that Israel and Usa dont love you,they want just war,because of your oil and money,they make war in midle east ,just understand it
2557 2018-11-04 18:22:40 Is this like making a trip to the Confessional? 
All is forgiven my son, carry on till next week, same time?
2558 2018-11-04 18:22:32 The sangeet function has a unique ceremony for the groom where they wear this headgear that is specific to Sindhis it’s like a crown, seek blessings do Pooja apply oil and stuff and then there is this custom to family ripping all the clothes off the groom. 
2559 2018-11-04 18:22:28 I think I just had third fish oil soft gel for the day.

2563 2018-11-04 18:22:08 Secretary Pompeo on rationale for excluding eight jurisdictions from sanctions against companies doing business with Iran: "There’s a handful of countries that have already made significant reductions in their crude oil exports [but] need a little bit more time to get to zero"

2567 2018-11-04 18:21:21 Are you drying all these or adding to oil or vinegar? Would be great as Christmas gifts with some #recipe ideas 
2568 2018-11-04 18:20:59 I did! Also coconut oil! I only tried pumping once to see if it would help my body progress  which it didn’t 
2569 2018-11-04 18:20:50 Did u pour groundnut oil On your face?
2570 2018-11-04 18:20:47 When we get independence from Scotland the waters and oil surrounding us will be in our territorial water. 

Scotland can bugger off
2571 2018-11-04 18:20:45 Again, the truth hit a trump derrick & an oil avalanche of lies spit out.

Source for your $13,000 lie? Trump wannabe? outFoxed news. Bernie Madoff?  Georgia KKK?

You lied. 

Back it up or you will lose votes Tuesday.
2572 2018-11-04 18:20:45 @BarryJenkins Did you use rosehip oil on skin for reflection on Moonlight??
2573 2018-11-04 18:20:43 Triglycerides are proving much more revealing of risk, especially in ratio to HDL. LDL has not been linked to CVD. CVD=Insulin resistance along with chronic inflammation brought on by the western diet. The worst mistake we made was getting away from lard and using veg oil.
2574 2018-11-04 18:20:27 @geography_411 The Russians need for natural resources has caused them to look for expansion.  They are looking for oil and land. Russia tried many ways to expand by invading other areas and trying to take over their area but the local army would capture them and kill them.

2578 2018-11-04 18:19:48 The truth is we need to designate a commercial farming zone. Create 400 hectare lots and allow people with capital or collateral to farm. Provide security of tenure and rule of law. No invasions. Resuscitate productivity . We are importing crude cooking oil . National herd????
2579 2018-11-04 18:19:26 I do think the extra push from Federer during the semis and the fact Djokovic wasn't at his best, was the door Khachanov needed to get over the hump. Give the kid credit, he put together a tremendous week in Paris.
2580 2018-11-04 18:19:21 A #globalist believes we must have freedom from our borders and from our identity as a nation and a #conservative believes we must have #freedom within our borders and within our identity. That is the difference and it is like oil and water. #erniekasper #truthbetold
2581 2018-11-04 18:19:21 Maybe he understands the importance of a stable Saudi Arabia in countering Iran’s terrorism and maintaining stable oil prices which underpin the World economy.
2582 2018-11-04 18:19:17 I came to get an oil change & my moms suppose to pick me up so I don’t wait here. I’ve been here for 20 minutes & she’s still not here. Umm what ? 
2583 2018-11-04 18:19:16 What are the benefits of black seed oil???
2584 2018-11-04 18:19:08 It's not about the oil. It's about the profits of war. Invading another country isn't a license to steal their stuff.  It's a license to rob the U.S. Treasury.
2585 2018-11-04 18:19:07 Cooking update- chicken is done too early, carrots are mush (literally) roasties are still potatoes in cool oil... please just do your thing 
2586 2018-11-04 18:18:58 1 fact is, no shortage of unskilled, essentially illiterate, marginally employable ppl already. Simply saying these ppl will do jobs others won't is not a justification for increasing a population who's return is only marginally above those they replace.

2592 2018-11-04 18:18:40 I think jasmine oil was way too much
2593 2018-11-04 18:18:01 Mac: "Onto the matter at hand. We're getting plowed in the  ass by the oil companies and the gas companies with their ten gallon  hats and their rotten ass-plowing hearts. So, as the brains of this  organization, I came up with a plan."
2594 2018-11-04 18:18:01 Lancashire Hot Pot at the Through the Villages (one third marathon) in Higher Wheelton this morning. And a strong odour of White Horse Oil in the changing room. Good old fashioned sport.
2595 2018-11-04 18:18:00 .@TylerDiep has never worked with our community's best interest in mind bc he's controlled by his corporate interests -- that's why big oil companies are pouring money into his campaign. 

But I know we need to protect our coast -- so I don't take a dime of their dirty money.
2596 2018-11-04 18:17:57 Sometimes I miss being in a relationship because I have no one to oil my back.
2597 2018-11-04 18:17:56 Why did you endorse no on 1631 and give a free boost to big oil’s $30 million ad push when even the UN has made it clear that large-scale carbon regs are the only way we’re gonna save our planet? This isn’t I-732, if you believe in climate change stop undermining climate action.
2598 2018-11-04 18:17:52 OK let's say oil is there coz zanu said so# WHATS NEXT

2600 2018-11-04 18:17:13 I’d suggest he’ll be scrabbling to save his local MP position - some very interesting conversations occurring in his ‘safe’ seat right now - vile and vindictive policy making with unsavoury blatant lies are to constituents what oil is to water - incompatible. #STOPtheLoanCharge
2601 2018-11-04 18:16:53 How do you get those work surfaces like that? We use Danish oil and they just get sticky. Rock and roll questions once you have kids eh? A few years back I'd have been more interested in the night before the lie in.

As usual it was all about oil and profeteering.

2611 2018-11-04 18:15:32 Maybe we should tell the NeoCons that there's oil in the United States. I bet that they'd send in the military then 
2612 2018-11-04 18:15:10 Quick recovery, clean it up n use coconut oil n aloe vera. Your scabs won’t be so terrible.
2613 2018-11-04 18:15:08 remember i use to wear make up everyday at work now it’s vitamin e oil all day everyday
2614 2018-11-04 18:15:00 Not impressed with a group of people who are intent in moving this country into corruption and backwards. This is a government of the people. Not a reality, dog and pony or snake oil salesman show. You people have been conned by the greatest con in the world.
2615 2018-11-04 18:14:57 Oil chafu imezidi chafu zaidi
2616 2018-11-04 18:14:50 Oh, 80% unemployment of migrants, personal experience in construction, data on tax collection vs utilization of social resources. I didnt see any in depth analysis of velocity of money relating to remittances, offset to benefits. It's a partisan review.

2620 2018-11-04 18:14:33 Oil, Agriculture fam everywhere...just not properly managed
2621 2018-11-04 18:14:33 @alikqvc Hi ladies can you please advise why it is important to oil your nails and how many times a day you should do this.
2622 2018-11-04 18:14:13 I'm all for doing something that's bigger than yourself but the military ain't it. They'll toss your life away and throw some damn dort on you for oil and ppl will pretend to give af. If I'm lying tell me why we have so many cripped vets out here without a place to stay ?
2623 2018-11-04 18:14:12 And Pompeo, Trump, and Putin still doing business with them. Waivers for their oil. Draining the resources while killing the innocent. This is Trump 's watch, and he has no humanity.

Chocolate lip scrub

-1 tablespoon cocoa powder
-2 tablespoons brown sugar
-1 teaspoon vanilla extract
-3/4 teaspoon honey
-2 teaspoons olive oil
2625 2018-11-04 18:13:59 Does anyone have experience with tea tree oil for the face?
2626 2018-11-04 18:13:54 I can't imagine smoking multiple grams every day anymore. Daisy and I will have a joint or two to wind down before bed, but since using other herbal/food/oil/spice medicines, I've had less of a need to smoke all day in an attempt to soothe nervous system irritation.
2627 2018-11-04 18:13:52 If current oil prices trend prevails, then yes
2628 2018-11-04 18:13:49 im sorry for arab's country and iran, when they can live with each other like a brothers,in flag of profit Mohamad , but........,please understanding that Israel and Usa dont love you,they want just war,because of your oil and money,they make war in midle east ,just understand it

2630 2018-11-04 18:13:19 Dunno what US troops are doing outside of their own country to begin with - besides feeding billionaire US arms-manufacturing & #Oil tycoons by fomenting wars everywhere else. DO it. Pull out of NATO. US "Protection" is a lie that has caused millions of deaths in other countries.
2631 2018-11-04 18:13:17 Time for an oil change... oooh, lordy! ＼(＾O＾)／
2632 2018-11-04 18:13:10 Smoke and mirrors from a snake oil merchant.
2633 2018-11-04 18:13:03 Religion and politics should not mix -- it's like oil and vinegar.

Coffee lip scrub

-2 tbsp used coffee grounds

2635 2018-11-04 18:12:49 Honestly tea tree oil is the true mvp
2636 2018-11-04 18:12:35 โถน้องจ๋าาา ต่อหน้าคนเยอะแยะแถมไลฟ์ยังขนาดนี้ ถ้าอยู่ตามลำพังแล้วล่ะก็.. ฮืออ
2637 2018-11-04 18:12:26 How many jobs would be created in Canada if these Canadian companies invested here?  Scheer will sell INDIA oil WHEN the pipelines are built. Why are you not protesting the 800.000 barrels per day of unenvironmental  oil from countries with no human rights.  Oh I know   Nice Hair
2638 2018-11-04 18:12:24 For the stuffy nose, boil some water and put in eucalyptus oil, you can either place your bare face over the steam or cover it with a hand towel but it clears the nose instantly !
2639 2018-11-04 18:12:22 My parents literally pay for everything .. Gas, insurance, oil changes!
2640 2018-11-04 18:12:13 You're really a big boy oga... Instead of breaking the bank just buy ponds oil control or If you need cement primer then buy milk of magnesia(sadly is very underrated)
2641 2018-11-04 18:12:11 Coconut oil is supposed to get rid of the smell!
2642 2018-11-04 18:11:52 Let’s stick with verifiable facts:

1 He lost his eye in Afghanistan 
2 Afghanistan is not Iraq
3 The oil it does have it sells to China 
4 Even if you were right, and you’re not, it would still be a cruel and unnecessary point to make
5 you’re being an ass
2643 2018-11-04 18:11:50 Today was the first time in months I’ve cooked chicken.
With lemon juice, salt, olive oil.
On boiled rice.
2644 2018-11-04 18:11:46 The USA won’t do a single thing. 

In exchange for military support, the Saudis agree to price oil in US dollars (Petrodollar) and have convinced other OPEC countries to do the same. This keeps the demand for $US dollar strong. 

Why would you be BFF’s for any other reason???
2645 2018-11-04 18:11:41 Mamba konki konki konki oil chafu.
2646 2018-11-04 18:11:36 i tried to order some cbd oil for my anxiety but then it declined my card and now i have even more anxiety ??? 
2647 2018-11-04 18:11:33 Because it's his fault that oil prices tanked?
2648 2018-11-04 18:11:25 It’s not oil, it’s bitumen and much more like tar mixed with sand than oil. Marketing a new name is never going to change the fact that bitumen is not oil.
2649 2018-11-04 18:11:22 And penut oil... All the penut oil
2650 2018-11-04 18:11:10 Try hemp CBD oil.  It really works and is legal, with no the  But don't take pain killers when you use the oil!!
2651 2018-11-04 18:11:08 When will the crypto tabloids understand that giving away free crypto to a company does not mean they have “partnered up.”

STELLAR has zero partners. 

If someone gave you a barrel of oil and told you to try and use it...  would they be your partner?
2652 2018-11-04 18:10:56 One woman I know looks like them. She’s never had to work because she was born with oil rights like the rest of her siblings. The posts she posts are sick. She believes EVERYTHING!
2653 2018-11-04 18:10:50 Dont know why I haven't followed?  Always been a fan though I think you're misguided sometimes.  Always intelligent, dignified and respectful , something lacking today In many.
2654 2018-11-04 18:10:50 We have a peanut allergy table at school with signs all over it and parents insist on setting their Chick Fil-A on it that's made in peanut oil. We run over to tell them and they all say, "I was just waiting for a table to open." We have to specially clean it every time. Asses.
2655 2018-11-04 18:10:39 Beto the burglar......he’s a phony bologna politician selling snake oil to people who can’t see truth. Scary how blind people are to this guys lies and scary how money can buy your way. This guy can’t represent Texas.
2656 2018-11-04 18:10:35 IMHO, mostly the opposite. UK/US staged a coup and made the Shah absolute rule because the then PM wanted Iran to get a bigger cut and control of oil revenues. Shah employe SAVAK secret police trained by CIA to keep control. Plenty of plenty of torture stories.
2657 2018-11-04 18:10:33 Another great day watching the oil men
2658 2018-11-04 18:10:22 But not burning oil negates everything you have mentioned early into it's life. I'm typing on a 10 year old Asus G50VT laptop that's been put thru it's paces. Put a fresh battery pack in a 10 year old EV, your good for another 10 years. Cradle to grave a huge win
2659 2018-11-04 18:10:21 1) TX and FL are run by GOP though, have been for a while. Also Venezuela used to thrive off oil and gas, why did TX economy grow when oil tanked but Venezuela went into recession? TX economy is more than just big oil.
2660 2018-11-04 18:10:09 Love too have the oil change dude try to upsell me on brake fluid until he..... checks his notes..... and sees I had it done last time I was here .......
2661 2018-11-04 18:10:08 im sorry for arab's country and iran, when they can live with each other like a brothers,in flag of profit Mohamad , but........,please understanding that Israel and Usa dont love you,they want just war,because of your oil and money,they make war in midle east ,just understand it
2662 2018-11-04 18:10:03 え、君顎あるの？顎ってやっぱりどこかで買うの？僕顎持ってないんだけど。
2663 2018-11-04 18:10:01 spoonfuls of raw honey. oregano oil. and teas :)
2664 2018-11-04 18:09:59 @keeleyelemis @Elemis can you tell me whether I use bliss capsules with the peptide cream to oil and which one would I put on first please x
2665 2018-11-04 18:09:50 I think arab oil is still central to the world's energy needs

but far, far less so than it was in the 1970s-80s

But our policy was designed around 70s-80s worldview and policy changes slowly.  Hell, we're still fighting the cold-war
2666 2018-11-04 18:09:42 All my senses have gone wrong and got muddled up. Can’t taste or feel food in mouth or it tastes rotten. Trying to eat as healthily as I can apart from biscuits. Hypersalivation but saliva feels like oil in mouth. Just very weird stuff.
2667 2018-11-04 18:09:27 Go get it from Aldi (but not the one in Exton because I just bought the 6 they had) Slap it in the crockpot with 1/4 c olive oil, 1/4 c OJ, 2 tbsp lime juice, 2 tbsp minced garlic, 1 tsp cumin & 1 tsp chili powder and cook on low forever. It’s amazing and you won’t regret it.
2668 2018-11-04 18:09:27 Can anyone explain to me why diesel fuel is so much more expensive then reg gas?  Is the oil/gas industries simply screwing the transportation industry?
2669 2018-11-04 18:09:18 Okay mate. But don't let that distract u from the fact that ur club was miserable without Oil money!
2670 2018-11-04 18:09:16 These women are supporting a misogynist  ... sickening that they are falling for a snake oil salesman.
2671 2018-11-04 18:09:15 813: 1. Good brain diet (neuro protective foods) top foods include avocados, blueberries, broccoli, coconut oil, green leafy dark vegetables and turmeric. #agelessmind #gymadvisor
2672 2018-11-04 18:09:03 Or you can make 100k+ a year in oil and gas.
2673 2018-11-04 18:09:01 Lotion followed by oil or butter (or both) combo is unmatched!
2674 2018-11-04 18:08:24 ADAM's the ultimate score, kid. No more grifts. No more scams. A monopoly on ADAM makes Standard Oil look like the Piggly Wiggly.
2675 2018-11-04 18:08:23 GOP working hard to drive up big oil prices how original Texans need to raise super pac money to buy 2020 Republicans somehow right and blame Iranians I guess
2676 2018-11-04 18:08:09 It isn't necessarily good news. The collapse is coming because of a world wide economic slowdown. Fracking requires $50/barrel oil to be profitable. Not that I like fracking but when oil prices dropped before those workers were laid off.
2677 2018-11-04 18:08:08 Facebook is the Standard Oil or US Steel of the Internet.  It has broken its pledge to Congress that our rights would be protected.  This monopoly cannot be trusted, so it must be busted!
2678 2018-11-04 18:07:53 Don't be so naive to think big oil propaganda has your best interests in mind. Oil used in plastics for the interiors equivalent or less than traditional vehicle if manufacture prioritizes better materials or not. Less mechanical mass. 
There is an impact in making the car but..
2679 2018-11-04 18:07:51 This man asked me do I soak in coconut oil, then attempted to smell my hair before I MUSHED him.. ummm sir  if you don’t baccck back mista.
2680 2018-11-04 18:07:43 Yes... "Globalists Socialists" who want their citizens to have affordable healthcare, strong unions, freedom from oppression, and a sustainable economy: OH, THE HORROR! 

Why do you support paranoid, oil war loving, greed-driven fascists?

Stop living in fear and #VoteBlue
2681 2018-11-04 18:07:38 Chai  
If na oil money we have money oO
2682 2018-11-04 18:07:26 Massage a few drops of coconut oil around the eyes to get rid off dark circles!
2683 2018-11-04 18:07:05 Oil and gas didn’t propose this. They are just against it. Environmentalists also have a long history of producing industry funded studies that support their side.  You’ll forgive me if I don’t fully believe them either. Who woulda thunk, both sides try to validate their side....
2684 2018-11-04 18:07:04 Low taxes
Millions of jobs
Destroying ISIS
Border security 
Supports Law and Order
Ended Korean war
Low Prescription Drug prices 
Lower cost of living

2685 2018-11-04 18:07:02 One point I make is emotion skews basic econ calculations to point of irrelevance. Doesn't change mathematical calculations only perception of them, leading to highly inefficient  practices. Noted by Adam.
2686 2018-11-04 18:06:55 I hate bath and body works smells...I prefer Coconut or Lavender regular lotion and baby oil.
2687 2018-11-04 18:06:47 Dutch fisherman help French fisherman to a sustainable future , there is al lot going ON in the port of Stellendam where local Shipyards ,rebauld france twinriggers (use to much Oil CO2) to renewed vessels that now are using the flyshoot fishing method , flyshootSeine Nets 2.0
2688 2018-11-04 18:05:58 Thank you for your service. Trump makes a mockery of US everytime he opens his mouth. He had multiple deferrments (5) for bone spurs despite playing every sport possible in school & college. He is a faker, has been all his life. He's a Snake Oil salesman working to get richer.
2689 2018-11-04 18:05:49 Small side note: tea tree oil is REALLY that girl! Lol that fucking zit did not steal my joy, hallelujah. S/o my skincare homies for that one. 
2690 2018-11-04 18:05:45 Some snake oil salesman liked that post, please if someone tries to make you buy spiritual shit, don't do it.
2691 2018-11-04 18:05:34 Ok but why do Venezuela need those dollars?
It's not like Argentina (hugh public debt in foreign currency).
They just import whatever is not oil to live. 
Why? Because working for the State serves them more than dedicating themselves to producing
2692 2018-11-04 18:05:27 BC Liberals don’t represent me or my views. They also approved an oil pipeline that trampled on indigenous rights and did not take into consideration the effects of marine life. That’s not my opinion but that of the Supreme Court
2693 2018-11-04 18:05:19 Easy on what? Curren$y's trash, a Motor Oil and Weed Rapper
2694 2018-11-04 18:05:14 If you ever want to get creative with food , try a tomato and basil sandwich with olive oil pepper and alittle mayo on hamburger buns 
2695 2018-11-04 18:05:08 that’s what I’m using. Jamaican Black castor oil
2696 2018-11-04 18:05:05 climate change wasn't a political issue until recently. You can find videos of both sides agreeing to fight the issue, RIGHT up until the right would actually have to follow through and delete their oil.
2697 2018-11-04 18:05:02 No hang on Liverpool are still top
1. History + 1 point.                                         2. Cheated from refs, oil money and UEFA + 1 point                                            So they are joint to still. Goal difference isn’t even a thing. So yes.
2698 2018-11-04 18:04:47 Soak em in conditioner and olive oil lol
2699 2018-11-04 18:04:45 Ang sarap sa balakang ng may effiscent oil.
2700 2018-11-04 18:04:41 Theoretically oil prices should go up as supply will be less than the demand !!
2701 2018-11-04 18:04:29 I always mix lotion and baby oil together all over my body, head to toe, before I get dressed...even my feet.
2702 2018-11-04 18:04:20 Fellas! We Like Nudes Too  So Oil That Lil Mf Up & Have A Photo Shoot 
2703 2018-11-04 18:04:01 Well I won't be answering you on this, because the previous discussions we've had were futile so why should I engage you on this again, when I know the partnership and sympathy your sect have for them has clouded your knowledge of the deen.
2704 2018-11-04 18:03:47 CBD Oil industry is growing fast and so many people including myself are getting amazing results from it 
It's medicine without a prescription 
Stop settling for pills to not work at all or doing a half job,, switch to CBD Oil and feel amazing now that's getting what u paid for.
2705 2018-11-04 18:03:34 An hour wait for my oil change. Was about to kick back & watch the Falcons/Redskins game. Then the guys changed it to soccer......

2710 2018-11-04 18:03:03 You think?  The oil industry will play a major role tho, so will technology and innovation
2711 2018-11-04 18:02:57 Take Care..Lavender Oil on your pillow shall help. xxx
2712 2018-11-04 18:02:53 They want me to pay extra to take it off the shelf. The eran out of the oil that they supply when doing an oil change.

2714 2018-11-04 18:02:39 It’s not an oil change I just got that done 2 weeks ago
2715 2018-11-04 18:02:17 You mean real money or oil money 
2716 2018-11-04 18:02:16 The oil companies have gone all-out convincing a lot in WA that they will go broke if it’s passed. Big money, big lies! #Yes1631 #SavethePlanet
2717 2018-11-04 18:01:50 200 years ago it would’ve been a wagon rolling up with a load of snake oil...      Trumpgate!
2718 2018-11-04 18:01:40 tell them give you the oil change so you can leave
2719 2018-11-04 18:01:33 That pour forth oil mission just kicked my ass on red dead.

me: zzzzz
2722 2018-11-04 18:01:10 I don't think it's about only allowing rich people to visit these monuments and Parks I think they want to strip mine them and suck all the oil out of them and then leave the mess for everyone else to deal with
2723 2018-11-04 18:01:06 Lmao this is exactly how I feel about coconut oil in my food 
2724 2018-11-04 18:00:55 Help to fill a container! Oil is what you need.  #ipadgames #gameinsight #ipad
2725 2018-11-04 18:00:54 You know why every asylum seeker wants to get to the USA? It's because United States of America is the only country that's not going to be attacked by United States of America in case they find oil
2726 2018-11-04 18:00:53 Someday oil won’t come up and burn me

Someday
2727 2018-11-04 18:00:51 Putting my pastry brush to good use applying my coconut oil hair mask.
2728 2018-11-04 18:00:49 The enemy is a snake oil politician telling you that only he can fight for you through ads bought by political promises to erode consumer protections.
2729 2018-11-04 18:00:48 Mutisi which Farms are producing sunflowers let alone Soya beans to produce chicken feed, my brother you might have been gone for too long, do you follow cooking oil producers and how they depend on imported soya beans? There is no farming that is taking place sufficiently
2730 2018-11-04 18:00:33 Pick a bottle from the back of the shelf, When it’s not possible to buy oil that comes in dark glass or stainless steel, choose a bottle from the back of the shelf.

2734 2018-11-04 17:59:32 There are international rules that apply to poor nations like Zimbabwe and different set for oil rich states that spend millions on American military hardware. They can massacre children in Yemen,butcher journalists and even kidnap Prime Ministers of small nations with impunity
2735 2018-11-04 17:59:29 U can use it dear, dont rinse it away, them apply tissue oil of any lotion
2736 2018-11-04 17:59:27 I've been trying to figure out how you sleep at night with handing a massive tax cut to the super rich, allowing Trump to lock up children without a word from Congress and the only answer is you being slathered in baby oil rolling around on a pile of corporate money

2738 2018-11-04 17:59:17 We don't have until the oil runs out. We are already out of time, if we don't change now to renewable clean energy we deserve to die on this planet. Space is already littered with our rubbish because we can't see past our own nose. There will be no escape.
2739 2018-11-04 17:59:04 We were a midtable team when the "oil money" came in, shows how little you remember. And even when we were in League One, Maine Road was louder than the library you call The Emirates.
2740 2018-11-04 17:59:04 Interesting, and yet, Iran tripled its oil exports to Syria in the past month while being forced to cut back to other markets.
2741 2018-11-04 17:58:56 Beer, face mask and hot oil treatments is what today will consist of.
2742 2018-11-04 17:58:52 A kilo of air travelling at 54 kilometres per hour has 112 takes up 1.2 cubic meters  joules of energy,a kilo of diesel has oil has close to 40,000,000 joules and would be about a litre volume. Any machine has to scale inversely to the densities of its energy source.
2743 2018-11-04 17:58:47 Sheep are easily led by a snake oil salesman, especially when playing the “other” card against those whom the followers deem to be the fault of their misfortunes.

2746 2018-11-04 17:58:15 Can @edmnangagwa afford more boobs like the oil finding, review of 2% tax on money transfers and the revelation that he has been controlling prosecutions by the NPA. These seem beyond gaffes, but like the way he conducts business. a trend is developing

2752 2018-11-04 17:57:36 I’m a woman and I side with the gamers. Mobile games are for killing time while waiting to get your car back from an oil change. Diablo should be on your PC with the biggest monitor you can get your hands on and with 3 hours or more to kill, not on a 3x5 screen.
2753 2018-11-04 17:57:36 He has gone Atul..The debate is over. Who got those players in the first place?Why do you have to see only one side of the coin.

2769 2018-11-04 17:55:41 Iran has nuclear ambitions and their political elite aren't friends with our political elite. It's about geopolitical alliances more than anything else. Other than that, they're pretty much the same in terms of extremism, fundamentalism, authoritarianism, and oil.

2861 2018-11-04 17:43:18 True. But the US and SDF are sitting on top of 30% of Syria’s territory with around 90% of the oil/gas. Turkey still holds Idlib which is another 10% of territory. So Assad & Russia won’t be able to rebuild or cash in without negotiating with the US.

2875 2018-11-04 17:41:05 I hate having to do everything as a woman. I need a man to change tires, get the oil changed, rotate the tires, etc. I’m never that much of a feminist

2886 2018-11-04 17:39:39 there's no firm tab on the foil, and it's glued on strongly (to resist the oil?) and there's no way to get the thing open without getting your fingers in the pb.
2887 2018-11-04 17:39:35 Author, Steve Hanley seems to be Married w/ Tesla and Musk.. That´s not realy a source I call reliable. There are dozens of other studies to show my previous txt right. With out no Oil Industry effects. Made outside US.
2888 2018-11-04 17:39:35 Foreign&regional countries are one of the main reasons for the deteriorating security&political situation in #Libya
This shows that the stability of Libya is contrary to the interests of those countries.
Some countries represented by big oil companies rather than by governments.
2889 2018-11-04 17:39:17 Appears that other than promising everyone a " Free Lunch" she has litting knowledge how the system in DC functions. Because you don't happen to "like" a President doe not mean he is subject to impeachment.  She is selling "snake oil" to the naive.
2890 2018-11-04 17:38:58 I personally like, "Stopping Mainers from buying heating oil?" because it's so regionally specific, but also how there are what feels like 200 angles in this diner

2895 2018-11-04 17:37:44 How about making it legal for Florida government employees to talk about climate change? As Benjamin Franklin said, "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure." But you & the other oil rich folks keep making it illegal for Floridians to prepare for climate disasters.
2896 2018-11-04 17:37:39 I need to go to the hair store .. need some more oil
2897 2018-11-04 17:36:54 Such a good thing. I hope many millons read your book. Best History lesson on food and oil I have ever read. The Big Fat Surprise rereading while I am waiting on 2 farming books.
2898 2018-11-04 17:36:43 1. Florida IS a coastal state. Texas thrived on oil & gas to then self-sustain its wealth
2. The point is that most European states have universal health coverage and mostly free education and still spend *less* on it
3. Where’s the American dream then?
2899 2018-11-04 17:36:41 sniff snorf ah yes i love the smell of oil and machines
2900 2018-11-04 17:36:41 Such a pessimistic outlook. Since 1990, a period of great economic growth including massive expansion of oil and gas production, Canada has reduced GHG emissions per GDP$ by 35%. We are good at innovating conservation, energy efficiency and emission reductions. We’ll do this.
2901 2018-11-04 17:36:39 If only I could use this with my 19 year old... lol "Baker gets his mom's car an oil change"

2903 2018-11-04 17:36:31 No Aioli is a mix of Garlic and Oil.  USED to make Mayonnaise and other things.  back in the day they used to call Criso that.  Big tub of white greasy stuff used in cooking.

Now, Trump is fear-mongering to save the party he has corrupted

2910 2018-11-04 17:36:06 Man!! Is he making himself rich!!!  He probably bought a bunch of oil and signing this just drove the price of oil up!!!  Not to mention all the taxes we pay on the cost of that oil!! What a racket he has going on!!

2918 2018-11-04 17:34:33 Is it an unwritten law that anti-inflammatory salves have to look and smell like motor oil?
I mean they help, yeah, but can't you make them smell like something other than oil from the 19th century?
2919 2018-11-04 17:34:22 Mineral oil
2920 2018-11-04 17:34:05 Sorry Rache, but I must set straight such a crooked claim before it flys too far. 
Take it from a conservative food scholar, some darker oils such as sesame and coconut top the charts as being more breakage resistant.
Whoever this is not the case with olive oil.
2921 2018-11-04 17:33:52 I also watched all of #SaltFatAcidHeat based on the cookbook of the same name, really enjoyed it, you can't really go wrong with an entire episode set in Italy about olive oil.
2922 2018-11-04 17:33:36 That's my read. They should've been smarter and realized that Lue was hawking snake oil, but let's be honest, they're not the sharpest tools in the shed.

2928 2018-11-04 17:32:55 Dear @realDonaldTrump 
If u DENY climate change 4 ur Big Oil & Coal donors, u are LYING. IF u refuse 2 do anything about systemic gun violence for ur NRA donors, u are beholden. If u EXPLODE the deficit 2 cut taxes for ur 1% Wall Street donors then attack SS/Medicare, u are EVIL!
2929 2018-11-04 17:32:45 @Shergasmic You want 5 years buy RDSA or BP and get 6 percent dividends and maybe you will buy oil low and it will go higher!
2930 2018-11-04 17:32:43 Let's not forget to also give Saudi Arabia a big boost in oil revenue,
so they can pay for the purchase of US weapons.
Pulling out of IND without a plan 'B' is diplomacy malpractice.
2931 2018-11-04 17:32:39 I dont know about that. The hostage situation was a result of the US and Britian destroying Irans democratically elected govt. Hostages or CIA operatives??

2942 2018-11-04 17:31:47 It was an oil supply/price recession. Dems caused it by the ANWR ban and the Cantwell Amendment which Obama voted for.  He had the blame.

2955 2018-11-04 17:30:12 I just follow my Yiayia's recipe, which she hasn't yet wrote down; everything's eyeballed. Basically you just brown chicken thighs in olive oil, and then add Ragu sauce, chicken stock, onions (if desired) and a cinnamon stick or two to the pot, and simmer for a long-ass time 
2956 2018-11-04 17:30:10 I use no hair care products aside from shampoo and conditioner. The brand I use is Shea Moisture/Alaffia. At night I brush and braid my hair, and only style my hair once or twice a week if that. For heat protection I use a small amount of coconut oil!

2999 2018-11-04 17:25:55 Castor oil it’s great! The organic one it’s works wonders. If you plan to wear it throughout the day and you wear contacts I recommend you not to put it on. Better use in the night

3006 2018-11-04 17:24:13 be thinking they slick like i said oil change thats it stop asking me about other shit unless you trying to pay for it out your pocket if not then stfu leave it alone and change my damn oil
3007 2018-11-04 17:24:03 The money was paid, as well as received through earnings on constructing the "Statue of Unity", by the Indians paying high cost for their oil & gas.
3008 2018-11-04 17:23:59 Never realized there was so much oil in Afghanistan.
3009 2018-11-04 17:23:54 Jen Bush, time to get out of the oil business and stop giving mega-corporations like chevron a boost.  Does chevron donate to national review? How much has chevron donated to the bush family?
3010 2018-11-04 17:23:39 @JohnShortJxS Was going through some old baseball numbers this morning and still can't get my head around Willie Mays winning NL MVP in 1954 and again in 1965, with similar type seasons. Who does that 12 years apart and at 34 years of age? Such a special ballplayer. #Giants
3011 2018-11-04 17:23:38 My family has been in the oil business for over 60 years. Sanctions on countries that sell oil do increase oil prices. It is predictable.

3013 2018-11-04 17:23:24 Oh no! I hope you get it sorted quickly. In the interim if you need a heat source I recommend a portable oil filled radiator. They are cheap to run and throw out ooodles of heat. I have one in my garage conversion as we were worried about screwing up the heating adding a new rad.
3014 2018-11-04 17:23:22 PDVSA is a State Owned Enterprise responsible for oil production in Venezuela. Chavez fired 18000 of its employees & replaced them with 120000 new workers. This #socialist agenda led PDVSA to produce 3 times less with more staff. The dangers of populism. #Politics
3015 2018-11-04 17:23:21 Using a hydrating moisturizer like neutrogena hydroboost gel and a serum/oil like vitamin c on top. The more moisturized you are the less oily you’ll be ironically.
3016 2018-11-04 17:23:05 Yeah we wouldn’t be where we are now without Sheikh but we’re not the only team in the prem spending big £ but the difference is we have spent it well and play the best football! United have got Salman sniffing round at the minute, so they best delete previous oil gags an all

3020 2018-11-04 17:22:47 Today I’ve decided to quit sugar and carbs and really having a diet consisting of meat, veggies, fruit, olive oil. A lot of smoothies and a lot of protein shakes. Shots of apple cider vin, vitamins, fish oil, the whole 9

3027 2018-11-04 17:21:56 @cellhelmet ... (spoiler alert, site doesn’t allow glass plus registration) it really puts your company in the snake oil category.
3028 2018-11-04 17:21:51 Isn’t that Mobil Oil ddnt find enough oil for their venture & communicated that th area had more gas? 

Th amount of oil they found was of low economic value & to be extracted over a short period. This means junior resource companies were able to come in.
3029 2018-11-04 17:21:41 I really really dislike winters, like I can't function because it's too cold and my limbs feel like they are frozen and I feel so tired and there's this heavy oil that seeps into my bones making them too heavy to lift.. and I just want to curl up in blankets and sleep..

3034 2018-11-04 17:21:09 Use paper towels to pat the steaks dry first before you fry them. 6 min for rare, 8 min for medium rare and 10 min for well done. I like my steaks rare so on a hot pan with olive oil start frying the steaks and do not season them until you are done it will dry up the steaks
3035 2018-11-04 17:21:05 Governing bodies will sweep if under the rug, media will continue as if nothing has happened. Oil money is flowing through everyone's veins.
3036 2018-11-04 17:21:05 Our economy is kicking ass, we have the lowest unemployment in 70 years, we’re about to do the biggest trade deal w/  China & US OIL , Isis is crushed,  tell me what don’t you like about Trump ? This man is kicking ass! #VoteRedToSaveAmerica2018

3039 2018-11-04 17:20:31 It was apparently a bad plan, as she missed a step, left the oil in the pan on high, smoked out the room and broke the induction hot plate in one go.
Serves me right, I guess.
3040 2018-11-04 17:20:30 Add some chopped colored peppers, red onions and some light sautéed mushrooms (no oil needed, mushrooms sweat water so just a pinch of salt and black pepper in a pan for few mins) to add some color and punch!

3045 2018-11-04 17:20:15 i’d recommend cbd oil. it’s safer and legal in every state. it’s the medicinal effect of the plant without the “high” effect.
3046 2018-11-04 17:20:00 They are on the Venezuela Plan. Vast amounts of oil and nothing but debt to show for it. I can not fathom the amount of contempt and antipathy she feels toward the people of Alberta.
3047 2018-11-04 17:19:43 Growth of media channels is mainly witnessed in business models where media houses are set up by owners  of on-going businesses of oil mills, confectionery or educational institutions etc. Media ownership seems to raise clout of owners manifold which in turn promotes business.
3048 2018-11-04 17:19:03 Under Commandante chavez, there was a massive reduction in poverty,  unemployment and income inequality.  Venezuela became an independent country freed from USA imperialism and stood proud.  The collapse of oil prices, the USA sanctions and opposition sabotage are to blame

3066 2018-11-04 17:15:54 You could start a filling station with the oil in Morata's hair
3067 2018-11-04 17:15:43 Trump made the statement years ago, "You can tell people stuff and they believe it. They just do." The gullibility of the average person is a lesson that Trump, like all snake oil salesmen, took to heart and he has made it the hallmark of how he deals with people -- all bullshit,
3068 2018-11-04 17:15:43 why does Israel import 80% of it's oil?
3069 2018-11-04 17:15:36 Uh...just watched this segment. Why did Fox cut off the interview on the oil purchase question? And, has Al-Waleed always been that twitchy? Panful to watch how uncomfortable he was, even knowing he may full well deserve it. Fox muzzles its own people again. That was sketchy!

3073 2018-11-04 17:14:42 @StarPlus don’t deserve KP like straight forward person. They avoided him, because they must have asked him to do something degrading him/his character & he refused. This cheap channel only gives space who can give oil to them all the time.

3078 2018-11-04 17:13:40 I’ve been using CBD oil to help with my anxiety & be present in general. However, some/most of the time my mind is just going 100 mph with the mom self shame and internalized shame with my actions & sex in general from how I was raised and childhood traumas.
3079 2018-11-04 17:13:29 Yep! I work in the oil field offshore and you have to have thick skin to work on a rig you got people from different worlds and different attitudes so i been conditioned to let thing roll by as long as you don't touch me we good but i never have ran into that problem thank God!.

3084 2018-11-04 17:12:20 Congratulations! India got waiver from US sanction.

What does it mean- 
- Now, India can continue with importing oil from Iran w/o attracting any trade sanction.
- This is a temporary arrangement.
- India is among the 8 countries who got this waiver.

3087 2018-11-04 17:12:13 I would be looking at Canna Farms, Redecan or Zenabis if you need flower. They all have stock.

If you need oil, CannTrust or Tweed can probably supply it.

3089 2018-11-04 17:12:00 I haven't noticed higher gas prices. But even so, typically higher gas prices means more Americans are back to work in the oil field, less dependence on foreign oil, and those working Americans are spending money, stimulating the economy.
3090 2018-11-04 17:11:39 Anyone with an open mind and an iota of logic can see they're nothing more than propaganda outlets for the Leftists.

3092 2018-11-04 17:11:33 Yep. Insurance covers those things though. Now if a guys engine were to suddenly seize up due to a bad oil filter that allowed fine carborundum granules to adhere to the cylinders walls...
3093 2018-11-04 17:11:25 I’ve invited you to show me all the ‘science’ backing up your claims, yet you showed me one study. It has absolutely zero credibility within the scientific world as a ‘cure’ for chrohn’s, so you are selling snake oil.
3094 2018-11-04 17:11:19 Sorry Adam. Not getting at you.

3111 2018-11-04 17:10:07 The easiest way to know if someone is for real in advocacy work is to look into their past. Has Romo been a big #concussion supporter and advocate since he began his company? It’s an honest question to ask yourself to help u separate the snake oil salesman from the rest

3116 2018-11-04 17:09:52 Your comment shows you don’t understand cause & effect. Prices of cooking oil went to $2.85 during the height of SI64 in 2017. These new prices were a result of money printing, policy announcements & a total loss of confidence. U r scapegoating industry for macroeconomic problems

3130 2018-11-04 17:08:39 Libya and Syria are still around also that was Bush that cause all that problem commotion because they were looking for oil instead of Bin Laden or have you forgotten that one? But I guess you were too busy waving around your 9/11 flag to realize that one
3131 2018-11-04 17:08:33 Yea that’s bound to happen in the present scenario  oil money is just rampant everywhere. Won’t be surprised if big clubs get taken over by big corps now or in the near future.Also, technically incorrect stmt when you say don’t have $- Etihad bought city shares for 2billion ;)

3138 2018-11-04 17:07:42 As long as Liberals are governing we will never move forward. Workers from every province have worked here in the oil industry and taken their income back o@their home provinces. Social programs need funding.  It took The Alberta NDP 2 years to recognize this.

Hello Rin

Thanks for getting in touch.
3145 2018-11-04 17:06:53 Unfortunately, oil companies have put tens of millions into defeating the initiative. They are blanketing the airwaves with ads that are scaring people into believing their energy rates will skyrocket & low info voters (which are a lot of voters) will probably believe it. 
3146 2018-11-04 17:06:34 I realize complain a lot idc  but why tf is my oil change 76 dollars

3164 2018-11-04 17:04:03 Got one, too. I figured they’re just auto sending to all WA area code numbers. Guess that’s what you can do with oil money.

3171 2018-11-04 17:02:55 I don’t remember that problem, but we used engine heaters in Iowa, so maybe they heated the trains oil, too.

3180 2018-11-04 17:01:51 I don’t what it is down to but it is a fraction of what is was during the years we were running out of oil and keen to find new sources...which we did, in spades, to the point where it is every year our largest or second-largest export and of great financial benefit to Canadians.

3186 2018-11-04 17:00:56 Rosemary oil and Lavender oil have always seemed soothing on my stupidly sensitive skin, so I started with those. Always used strong anti-dandruff shampoos before and these shampoo bars seem much gentler on hair and skin. I’d stick with them regardless of the plastic-free angle.
3187 2018-11-04 17:00:45 Fuck this.

3212 2018-11-04 16:57:11 Jackass better talk this up quickly.

Because on Monday Nov 5th, when we are no longer buying Iranian oil, everybody tells me the price of oil will double.

Following that, a few days after the election, the price of gasoline is also likely to double.

3241 2018-11-04 16:54:00 Yup, and all that corn feed to cows, and corn oil fed to humans has made the US population's omega-3:6 ratio way off a healthy one, contributing to the vast disease burden.  And most of the nitrogen was captured with massive fossil fuel emissions.  What a well thought out system!
3242 2018-11-04 16:53:53 Ten years from now, that will absolutely happen.  Think of the progress just in the last 20 years on this issue.  I bought CBD oil the other day and the fucking grocery store!  That wasn't an option even 3 years ago!

3247 2018-11-04 16:53:10 Can you explain how 1631 is unaccountable or is that something you heard in an oil company ad and are now repeating here?

Trying to take action against climate change is hardly a pet project.  Unless we make big changes soon, it will be the only political issue.
3248 2018-11-04 16:53:06 You do realize China was already the biggest buy of US oil exports and stopped w the threat of trade wars so this would just be a return to the previous norm.  Also, US oil and Iran oil are different qualities so it cannot "replace" Iranian oil.  Smoke and mirrors as usual.

3250 2018-11-04 16:53:01 As I recall the SNP's conclusion is that they were snake oil salesmen. Seems about right. There's a key difference between using companies to better understand the electorate & to test messages etc and essentially trying to manipulate voters.

3276 2018-11-04 16:49:38 I don't worship Elon either. I consider him a hedge for our society that has been addicted to oil. It's an addiction because we have become allies with nations that share absolutely no values with ours, protecting whom caused a lot of deaths and a lot of our wealth.
3277 2018-11-04 16:49:35 #BREAKING — @clackamasfire reporting a “major crash” on Highway 212 near Sunnyside Rd.

Involves multiple cars with multiple ppl trapped.

Avoid the area if possible. Updates to come.

3280 2018-11-04 16:49:16 Because its 100% fact and you are telling lies calling it snake oil lmfao you cant back that claim up even if you tried you lost  because cant debate
3281 2018-11-04 16:49:12 I’m just praying for One more Oil BOOM I promise I won’t piss it away the next time!
3282 2018-11-04 16:49:09 Fair enough. The problem is many don't trust Jason Kenney or his motives (and hidden agenda) one bit. He is a modern snake oil salesman with a history of surrounding himself with racists, anti-LGBTQ, anti-abortion and misogynists. Wolf in sheep's clothing.

3286 2018-11-04 16:48:44 Have you tried cinnamon? I got rid of bugs organically with cinnamon with a few drops of peppermint essential oil mixed in. Also make sure if you water it’s only twilight or later. Watering in the sun is wasteful and destroys lawns which brings pests.
3287 2018-11-04 16:48:36 Now UNICEF has started talking about food in the port of Al-Hodeidah while ignoring that # Al-Houthi is holding 16 ships loaded with 199,000 tons of food, medicines, medical equipment and oil derivatives . Whenever the coalition approached the liberation of the # Hodeidah
3288 2018-11-04 16:48:34 What a shame Encana moves their office to Denver from Calgary! That tells you that the oil and gas jobs are leaving Canada!! We must work together to build safe smart pipelines in Alberta!!

3299 2018-11-04 16:47:16 Trudeau doesn’t have the money to appeal...he’s saving our money to pay for the $260 billion oil sands cleanup price he’ll have to pay to bailout Alberta, who’ll whine about that bill.
3300 2018-11-04 16:47:07 Yip. I remember all that at school. They said all the oil would be gone by 2010.
3301 2018-11-04 16:47:06 Agreed!!  Also, who puts wheat flour and soybean oil in ice cream!!!!  Their ingredients don’t resemble anything natural to real ice cream. Natural flavors are highly processed ingredients. Their ice cream is a gastronomical nightmare.
3302 2018-11-04 16:46:59 Fast Eddies is NOT fast and they charge too much for an oil change

3311 2018-11-04 16:46:17 It absolutely does, we cannot snap our fingers and stop oil useage.  Your views lack consideration for our fiscal reality.  And consideration for % of tax dollars generated by the industry.  Your beloved $100K+ Tesla is a paperweight in 5 yrs.
3312 2018-11-04 16:46:12 Taking the extra oil was extra work..taking a clue from the parable of the virgins.

3314 2018-11-04 16:46:01 Congratulations for higher profits. However, will you please clarify whether it is due to higher crude oil production or due to higher crude oil prices and weakening of Rupees against dollar?
3315 2018-11-04 16:45:57 hope oil oh hahahaha

3318 2018-11-04 16:45:29 Coconut oil underneath before any moisturizer in winter even if you have oily skin and the dryness or the air sucks the oil. I mix products really, but had stocked on Corium Serium and it works

3320 2018-11-04 16:45:17 ive been washing my face and then putting like three drops of melaleuca (tea tree oil) in a bit of water and spreading it on my face with a disposable cloth every night, then moisturizing

3334 2018-11-04 16:43:27 Carry some peppermint oil with you! It eases the nausea, truly a life saver. You can rub a little on your hands or just smell the bottle.

3391 2018-11-02 23:55:12 I disagree. We KNOW what’s happening and refuse to do anything about it until we are faced with the consequence itself. As consumers we can make choices that are environmentally responsible, releasing the choke hold oil and gas has on us.

3408 2018-11-02 23:52:08 Good. Maybe then they will care not about the ratings but about the actual content they produce. Big corporate media (including Fox) are as bad for America as Big Pharma, Big Insurance, Big Oil... you get the idea.
3409 2018-11-02 23:51:54 それが一番難しいーーーーーーｗｗｗｗｗｗｗ
3410 2018-11-02 23:51:50 I had to look up what mct oil was. Never heard of that before.
3411 2018-11-02 23:51:48 Two Witches, 1523, Hans Baldung (Grien), oil on panel.
3412 2018-11-02 23:51:43 Baby wipe, face wash, micellar + toner, moisturizer, oil
3413 2018-11-02 23:51:43 its all about oil, there is zero reason to even be in iran and syria, but successive governments are trying to build the oil and gas pipelines into europe, africa and the china through iran,syria turkey, energy triangle etc
3414 2018-11-02 23:51:37 How about we embargo Saudi Arabia  oil.
#KhashoggiMurder
3415 2018-11-02 23:51:36 It's Scotland's oil.
3416 2018-11-02 23:51:31 TRUMP INTERNATIONAL has BIG $$$ at stake with the IRAN DEAL !! It’s NOT about NUCLEAR Arsenals it’s ALL ABOUT your PROPERTY and THEIR OIL. MANY AMERICANS SEE THRU YOUR NARCISSISTIC-DICATORIAL ways. The USA will be VOTING you DOWN
3417 2018-11-02 23:51:30 Alaskans own 15,985 shares of PDC ENERGY INC, worth $996,665. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in UNITED STATES.

3422 2018-11-02 23:50:57 The coconut oil will kill me.
3423 2018-11-02 23:50:50 Try CBD oil!
3424 2018-11-02 23:50:49 Except that they can't pay for anything beyond their immediate vicinity (which is where the risk is) because no more oil money.
3425 2018-11-02 23:50:42 Ordered a dark roast black coffee at Starbucks & they gave me a peppermint mocha. Feel bad for the girl behind me that's about to take a swig of motor oil
3426 2018-11-02 23:50:36 Another good episode - so many Snake Oil salespeople about these days
3427 2018-11-02 23:50:32 I might have tea tree oil maybe somewhere. If not I'll try the toothpaste. Thanks!

3429 2018-11-02 23:50:27 Oil&Gas?
3430 2018-11-02 23:50:18 Except for the waivers you’re giving to 8 countries to keep oil prices low, right?
3431 2018-11-02 23:50:08 Did U.S. reward Turkey's Tupras of reselling Iran oil in open market?

3433 2018-11-02 23:49:57 If a PSA hasn’t been signed and Invictus haven’t struck oil then what’s been discovered? Prospect and discovery are two different things in E&P.
3434 2018-11-02 23:49:45 @johnnyrichter Hey Richter it’s me Gina hey listen the guy that you were living with Ect does he have access to fill orders of the oil cartridges I have a friend that needs a big order on those cartridges
3435 2018-11-02 23:49:45 And a little bit of the Nate Diaz wonder drug, CBD oil, under my tongue, at bedtime. Eases some pain, and helps me sleep.

3438 2018-11-02 23:49:37 Gah....DAMN that was smoother than coconut oil on black skin
3439 2018-11-02 23:49:36 THIS IS OUTSIDE MY EXPERTISE, BUT I'M PRETTY SURE THE JOBS CLASSIFICATION IS "MINING (EXCLUDING OIL AND NATURAL GAS)" PROBABLY TO DISTINGUISH "MINING" FROM "DRILLING"
3440 2018-11-02 23:49:36  Sorry Trump,i will not buy the oil from ISIS, i will not kill the Kurds
3441 2018-11-02 23:49:34 They buy a LOT of Oil. They know one contract strike won't help...that is why their companies have had reps all over Canada for 3 years securing supply. Everyone knows it, except for one small Native council in BC..
3442 2018-11-02 23:49:34 What I WANTED: a sandwich piled high with meat and coated in mayo.

WHAT I GOT: a salad sans-meat that relies on chickpeas for the protein.  I'm even tossing out the dressing in favor of extra virgin olive oil and a little lemon juice.

Sometimes, doing the right thing is hard.
3443 2018-11-02 23:49:25 Main benefit of a low oil price is to keep the frackers and tar sands produces out of the money.

3447 2018-11-02 23:49:13 Oil cleansing was the thing that finally sorted my skin, and it cleared up so quickly too, like it was really noticeable within a fortnight.
Cheap as too, as what worked best for me was a mix of grapeseed & Almond that l can make myself.

3449 2018-11-02 23:48:35 Well, one thing he did do was get petrol prices down from £1.50 to £1.00. Under May they oil companies are back on the crooked endless fleecing of the gullible public.

3453 2018-11-02 23:47:43 When president makes things better for the American people, the Democrats, along with big business and the oil companies, have prices increased to make the president look bad. Never before in history, as any Party refused to work with the elected president Americans until now
3454 2018-11-02 23:47:41 Hum! Ça coûtera beaucoup de #oil pour que ça grince pas!

3456 2018-11-02 23:47:13 Also, lower oil means bigger demand and less profitability for US producers. Good point about China.
3457 2018-11-02 23:47:09 Six to eight children a week are starving to death this year in Venezuela because Saud........oh wait that’s not right.

3465 2018-11-02 23:46:17 I’ve “heard” that there is more oil in this country than anywhere else on the planet! It’s just a LOT harder to get to. (Not sure if that’s actually true...) Hello imported oil!! Waiting for the <$1.00 gal. gas!!!
3466 2018-11-02 23:46:16 Lmfao real man my oil change is like $45/50 anyway cause it’s synthetic oil

3473 2018-11-02 23:44:20 Venezuela collapsed because they overleveraged their economy on oil. The same thing happened to capitalist Nigeria and Brazil. But I'm talking about Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Germany, France snd England.
3474 2018-11-02 23:44:16 Do you have any tea tree oil? It helps a lot! If not put toothpaste on them. It will help dry them out. Sounds weird but I swear it helps. Dang! Sorry. 
3475 2018-11-02 23:44:13 rice with turmeric some spicy pesto and peppers, garlic onions, broccoli ( any veg really) and fry them with coconut or rapseed oil and then add already cooked rice. Its really good hot or cold too :)
3476 2018-11-02 23:44:09 Butter, salt, turmeric, ginger, cinnamon, cocoa powder, coconut oil, coconut milk
3477 2018-11-02 23:44:07 This is wrong and needlessly provocative. Expect naval harassment in the Gulf and aircraft intercepts. There will be an oil deal with Russia as a stick in DT’s eye.
3478 2018-11-02 23:43:46 I am kinda on hold with Zhenhua Oil/ China until late in the month when they are hoping to fly in for a meeting.  I am working with the UK now though while i wait.

3481 2018-11-02 23:43:28 I can't blame @StateDept entirely, but this does illustrate perfectly why we are not "a force for good in the world."

We have to align ourselves with many of the world's skankiest leaders just to keep the oil flowing . . . .

Among other things. PLUS
3482 2018-11-02 23:43:23 I can't even remember what I would have been looking at anywhere that would earn me fermented bean cake, hot chili oil and fermented ginger on Amazon... maybe an online food order yesterday from Diep!

3484 2018-11-02 23:42:15 Not so much for WMB, TRGP and KMI, which aren’t MLPs. seems more like a lack of interest in energy broadly, especially when oil prices are shooting higher, then when oil prices move higher and folks want exposure, midstream just isn’t the preferred way to express energy trade...

But that's not all this man took our little roadrunner and changed the oil and washed and vacuumed her out good good. This man I swear to baby jesus was sent to me from god
3489 2018-11-02 23:41:37 Another Snake Oil Salesman. Christianity should come with a public health warning!!!!
3490 2018-11-02 23:41:20 So it’s starting to look like the only way to stop oil & gas extraction is direct, confrontational action. Bc this legislative, letter writing, vore’em out stuff is not working. We. Are. Out. Of. Time.
3491 2018-11-02 23:41:18 Is that a side of ribs slathered in oil? Eeew Exxon
3492 2018-11-02 23:41:16 Economics can be used to remove people from basic reality. If i see an empty factory, i see unemployed stressed factory workers . I know the gov can create money out of thin air. All thats needed to get the whole thing going is money like oil in a machine. Then i say do it.
3493 2018-11-02 23:40:58 And then you walk, oil in the water 
How come you can't be with me?

3502 2018-11-02 23:40:09 Most americans are still working low paying jobs or longer hours to make ends meet. I am sure nobody has retired since you are in office because of the wealth they've acquired since you were in office.  Except for your steal and oil corporation buddies who greased your palm.
3503 2018-11-02 23:39:53 the strangest thing about assembling watch movements is applying a µlitre of oil without a pipette
3504 2018-11-02 23:39:36 I have been working my ass off all year but a lot more that last month right? Over been working 12hr shifts non stop lately and most weekends. Well with all that going on I haven't been able to wash the roadrunner or get the oil changed.
3505 2018-11-02 23:39:32 Yeah, I spray them down with olive oil and put turn in a super hot oven, flip halfway

Kielbasa and Mrs T's is a perfect meal

I mean, a veggie is probably technically needed but whatever
3506 2018-11-02 23:39:28 To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it

you gonna color her shiny?
3508 2018-11-02 23:39:16 Yep. The dopes just don’t know how long it will last. At least a hundred years. And that’s without the BP Oil spill in the equation too.

3513 2018-11-02 23:38:46 How do you go from eating 2-3 plates of pasta and one gellato and drinking 2 bottles of wine a day and bathing in pure olive oil nightly to being normal again? Asking for a friend.
3514 2018-11-02 23:38:43 Yo this ain’t spicy enough, y’all got some chili oil??? *dumps entire jar on entree*
3515 2018-11-02 23:38:40 (Since they live comfortably on oil welfare; the government has to keep telling businesses to hire Saudi citizens and not foreigners.)

3518 2018-11-02 23:38:12 Who is going to pay for the clean up of the oil sands? Asking because it is projected to cost $17 million to clean up after a little paint factory at Laurel Pt, Victoria, BC. Paint folks aren't paying, taxpayers are. Alberta will cost BILLIONS!
3519 2018-11-02 23:38:12 I don't need an.oil change for another 2,000 miles but I want another one for.the winter is thAt weird. Lol
3520 2018-11-02 23:38:00 Coconut oil
3521 2018-11-02 23:37:47 The oil companies have abandoned oil wells in the past, requiring more taxpayer to clean up.
3522 2018-11-02 23:37:46 How come no one calls out Bart LeBon for having economic thinking that might've been reasonable in 1978 but in 2018 it's not relevant. Big oil and the military aren't going to save Alaska's economy.

As far as Kevin Meyer, hell, no one cared about the Corrupt Bastards.
3523 2018-11-02 23:37:06 US allowing eight importers to keep buying Arabian oil is a mistake in my opinion. Leaders of Iran have only one goal, to harass the United States even to the point of endangering American lives. They are our enemy  and should be treated as such
3524 2018-11-02 23:37:03 I ate this for breakfast today. I sliced the field roast, tossed it some oil with garlic, spinach and broccoli and then tossed some spaghetti very al dente into the pan with salted cooking liquid, turn til sauced, add pepper and romano cheese. boom. Field Roast caico e pepe. Yum!

3527 2018-11-02 23:36:30 to show you your oil level, it’s supposed to be at a certain level & it should be a lighter color cause that means it’s new oil

3532 2018-11-02 23:35:58 It is price USA must pay for claiming she is the largest oil producer - for what? A great talking point for President Trump but bankruptcies very soon for shale producers.
3533 2018-11-02 23:35:55 Ummmm good question. Tbh idk any vegan ones specific brands. I’ve looked into it and they do exist but not in the popular brands you can buy at the supermarket here in UK. Trick is to buy any ramen and season it yourself with sesame oil, soy sauce and whatever you fancy.
3534 2018-11-02 23:35:46 Just stop. Don’t make me laugh. Why do you think your Arab boy is pumping so much oil in your club? Because he wants that trophy. Don’t care what you want

3541 2018-11-02 23:34:37 I’m a veteran and I currently work in the oil and gas industry. Today I was proud to vote for @RichCordray, @SenSherrodBrown , and a straight @OHDems ticket.
3542 2018-11-02 23:34:32 How come it isn’t a big THING that Rep Lt Gov candidate is PRESENTLY a “investment return coordinator” for coconuts oil?? The cynicism is off the scale and my cynicism scale is logarithmic.
3543 2018-11-02 23:34:06 Olive oil 
3544 2018-11-02 23:33:37 Actually it seems that they’re really not answerable to anyone, even to themselves. Their oil is the kool aid favorite drink of the West; and most of their(West) financial institutions kiss their ass to borrow money that you never hear about. It’s a crazy world
3545 2018-11-02 23:32:56 A relationship like oil and water, but common interest is love of money and power.
3546 2018-11-02 23:32:46 I forgot to book also so looks like it’s almond oil and cling film for me

3560 2018-11-02 23:30:39 Something about too many cbd products sounds like snake oil
3561 2018-11-02 23:30:35 I closed(bought) this house the day the oil came onto Pensacola Beach - 2010? Our quality of life here is so effected by the climate . I hope Floridians will demand that our elected will recognize this fact on Election Day

3563 2018-11-02 23:30:17 Except that South Africa held the world supply of Diamonds in their hands, S.A. holds oil and the parallels of this are very much in the game.  Mulroney was a junior statesman and brokered support from Reagan and Thatcher.

3566 2018-11-02 23:29:57 Whats Next? change operators by robots? Do not bleed and get oil? that the weapons are toy and that every time you kill someone tells you that you did not kill him and it is only a game and that life is wonderful so that you do not stay with some trauma?
3567 2018-11-02 23:29:42 So I come home from a long day, the longest day of work to find out I have to buy new front brakes and brake shoes for my truck with $7 in my bank account. I also need to get an oil change done.
3568 2018-11-02 23:29:39 They sell sex shower kits, still dangerous. Water is not lube so then you need an oil based lube and that adds to the slip and then peens or bones get broken.

3572 2018-11-02 23:29:20 You’re a liar!  Not all of us are low information voters.  We heard you say you’d expect us to pay more. Snake oil.  Vote @bobforgovernor!

3574 2018-11-02 23:29:15 I want him here too. #MunkDebates #MunkDebate He's created, curated, & deployed intentionally false information, using overt rudimentary Nazi propaganda tactics.  I'd be more interested to know what motivates him, as I have no doubt that he's aware of his snake oil salesmanship.

3576 2018-11-02 23:29:07 He’d have more luck glassing the place and setting up automated oil rigs, than the Iranians giving anything back.  

Thanks President 44. Thinking about it, President Trump did request to see his papers...his “nation-first” senses were tingling.
3577 2018-11-02 23:29:06 If CID managed to raid Magaya after the press conference then what’s going to happen to the Muzarabani Oil press conference convener
3578 2018-11-02 23:29:03 Aguma just shows how gulliable we are as a country. We will believe that there is oil and gas to be found. We will believe mega deals and investors knocking on our door. That a gvt needs months to address simple problems. We are going to be a middle income economy by is 2030.
3579 2018-11-02 23:28:43 
3580 2018-11-02 23:28:36 Why do you give a snake oil salesmen like Saramucci air time?
3581 2018-11-02 23:28:26 Okay, so you can mix a little salt in his water and then use a syringe to basically force feed him. You can also water down wet food with more water, kind of make it soupy, and syringe feed him that. You can also syringe some corn oil into to help lube up his GI track.
3582 2018-11-02 23:28:23 Pecan Pie or GTFO, bye 
3583 2018-11-02 23:28:16 Yep! It’s a made up problem to sell bs snake oil products. 
3584 2018-11-02 23:28:02 HOLY FUCK I SHOULD HAVE BEEN USING OIL ON THE PAN TO MAKE EGGS INSTEAD OF THAT PAM NONSTICK SHIT. I'M SO FUCKING STUPID
3585 2018-11-02 23:28:02 nah, it’s real. it’s about the same level of snake oil for cancer “awareness” but I think it actually serves a slightly better purpose than “save the boobies” type stuff

3588 2018-11-02 23:27:32 It wasn't obama's to give away, it belonged to the American people. Occupy their oil fields and manage the income until it gets paid up. Then give obama life in prison.
3589 2018-11-02 23:26:53 That’s my point,in consequence they aren’t part of the civilized world,as a matter of fact. 
But civilization is greedy for energy and economy demands low prices and from this point further,civilization kinda prostitutes itself and keeps the Saudis in the game for cheap oil...

3592 2018-11-02 23:26:39 If you don’t see a problem with that then I question your intelligence. I want us to get as much out of our oil as possible and use the money to fund a greener future. Or do you think wind turbines and solar panels are going to be made with wishful thinking?
3593 2018-11-02 23:26:37 The best way to cook taytoes 
Goose fat, coconut oil or beef dripping makes them juuuuusst right
Second best is a good jacket spud 
3594 2018-11-02 23:26:32 Well, money to house and feed them?  I read the other day The United Nations urged President Trump take them in.

Somebody commented, [T]he UN then can pay the USA $ 1 Trillion a year.  Equivelant Crude Oil from Iraq they owe us.  refined gold and silver from member countries.
3595 2018-11-02 23:26:26 I love Ca mg combos and I eat a lot of fresh caught salmon, never tried the CLA but I’ve always eaten coconut oil both in foods hot drinks and by itself. Never tried the DLPA. Will look into it.
3596 2018-11-02 23:26:24 Oil
3597 2018-11-02 23:26:13 In the case of Italy, with 50 billion surplus, do you mean to say that it will have problems finding $ for oil?
3598 2018-11-02 23:26:06 That’s true we gave them money for oil!
3599 2018-11-02 23:26:06  a friend of mine recommended Coconut oil maybe you could try that.

God bless you
3604 2018-11-02 23:24:19 I was just curious. We have sprayed the couple of large pillows in my room with oregano essential oil watered down to help with disinfecting.
3605 2018-11-02 23:24:10 You do realize they have that exact same flag with a red straight for firefighters the green straight for border Patrol and other stripes for other agencies. But go ahead and keep wearing your tent oil hat and drinking the kool-aid
3606 2018-11-02 23:24:04 Workers in American plants such as coal mines and oil rigs should be aware that the trump administration doesn't care about workers health or life.  Wake up coal miners.  Trump has cut OSHA.
3607 2018-11-02 23:23:47 Also... peppermint oil is a fantastic study buddy. Burning a peppermint candle or using an essential oil (on your pulse points, or just breathing it in) is good for your brain. If you use it every time you study, you'll start to associate the scent with learning. Good luck!!!
3608 2018-11-02 23:23:46 They all talk about "free votes" for their MLAs and they'll represent their constituents during election time. And then things change... it's called catering to the big support. unions, big business, oil, and then the pandering, minorities, special interest, and #PWD are last.
3609 2018-11-02 23:23:35 Like hell it is lol she gets on my nerves! She used all of my aloe vera oil like I wouldn’t notice.. she gon get smacked
3610 2018-11-02 23:23:20 Estimates are peculiar. Much of the oil shale in America was known in the ‘70s but they never thought the EROEI would be positive enough to allow drilling. Once it was, this caused re-evaluations of other areas. Idk how applicable this is to other minerals but similar.
3611 2018-11-02 23:23:13 The guy who funds the organization that funds the groups protesting our pipelines, is s major stake holder in several U.S. and Brazilian oil companies. We are selling our oil for next to nothing, U.S. companies are refining it and selling it back to us at huge profits.

3620 2018-11-02 23:22:12 Your article is completely idiotic. Every OTC fish oil failed. For you to say that Vascepa never went up against OTC fish oils makes you sound completely uninformed. Amarin stock will soar on November 12. Do your research on Vascepa before you write another stupid article.
3621 2018-11-02 23:22:08 So glad I don't work corporate so I can ignore the snake oil.
3622 2018-11-02 23:21:59 I will keep my vitamin e oil on hand! :)
3623 2018-11-02 23:21:47 I cut my finger last night, cut myself again peeling the skin off the potatoes & now my mom just burned my with oil  ALL ON THE SAME FUCKING HAND   
3624 2018-11-02 23:21:45 One of the worst roll backs is decreasing funding for OSHA . Workers will suffer in mines,. Processing plants, oil rigs.  The number and type of injury is being struck from OSHAs page which keeps workers in the dark as to safety violations cut an number of injuries.
3625 2018-11-02 23:21:27 As if my brothers just put that olbas oil shit up his nose (which is obvs no meant to go there) and now it’s burning him and he’s greeting asking if he’s gonny die 
3626 2018-11-02 23:21:15 I like antibiotic ointment applied to open cuts I get from single-tail play and mild cutting, vitamin E oil, and jojoba oil are also nice. Basically keeping it moist while it heals and germ-free helps me.
3627 2018-11-02 23:21:12 Smelled clove oil in the store and it smells like my dad  gotta get some next time.

3638 2018-11-02 23:20:00 15. Iran sanctions and supply fears had previously had oil prices on the boil and perhaps heading toward $100 a barrel. It takes a substantial event to reverse such market psychology, but fading US-China trade hopes qualify as such an event. #USChinaForum2018 @TulaneLaw
3639 2018-11-02 23:19:58 Fry green beans and broccolini with a bit of olive oil (also fry mushrooms if you’re into those), in a bowl with raw spinach, grated carrot, pine nuts, apple and pear. I add boiled egg and cheese but you don’t need to. Salt and pepper, chuck some balsamic vinegar at it and go
3640 2018-11-02 23:19:57 Nice! I take CBD capsules every morning to help with my anxiety, then some oil during the day if it's needed! We hope it works for you like it does for us!!

3642 2018-11-02 23:19:12 Let’s hope you talk to your friends at home who will explain to you that the time of reaping the earth, burning coal, oil and removing forests after having emptied the ocean does not make sense.
3643 2018-11-02 23:19:11 <みなさんにとっての"オイル"とは何ですか⁇
3644 2018-11-02 23:18:46 Yup, you can say so. What makes things worse here is the oil fields, petrochemical and chemical factories around the area because they are emmitting heat
3645 2018-11-02 23:18:34 Their skyward sword varnished by mineral oil slithered into their arena of combat
3646 2018-11-02 23:18:23 You're talking about the hostage crisis following the 1978 revolution. Do you know the revolution was due to anger at the previous regime installed by the US & UK via a coup organised by the CIA & MI6 in 1953? They overthrew & imprisoned the democratically-elected leader for oil
3647 2018-11-02 23:18:15 There was great diplomacy and stability in the Middle East for centuries before European nations decided to expand their empires down into the region - especially at the turn of last century when oil became a valuable commodity. 

ME, Persia & FE was an absolute jewel
3648 2018-11-02 23:18:07 Wait, is soybean oil bad?!
3649 2018-11-02 23:17:51 Well said, I personally wouldn't want to buy the prem title, but I'm sure lots of fans would swap our owner for a super wealthy oil baron if it meant silverware in the cupboard.
3650 2018-11-02 23:17:46 Really? Cannibalism.  Some of these here could feed a tribe and light their oil lamps for WEEKS! Geeeez!
3651 2018-11-02 23:16:59 But arms deal is far more important!!! Assisting Saudi in the killing of people of Yemen (Oil money) Just ask Trump he will tell you!!! While at the same time sending soldiers to stand guard against women and children seeking LEGAL asylum....  SHAME!! VOTE 
3652 2018-11-02 23:16:55 Mannn I just got hot oil treatment, I’m in heaven right now
3653 2018-11-02 23:16:44 1. It poses a risk of oil price increases, but Saudi Arabia doesn't have enough of a modern army to put up a fight.
3654 2018-11-02 23:16:42 Long live oil!
3655 2018-11-02 23:16:29 Get the softest skin ever by smoothing on baby oil in the shower after washing or add a few drops of baby oil in your body wash and shake!
3656 2018-11-02 23:16:28 @maddow @Lawrence @DNC @TeamPelosi @chrislhayes @AriMelber @amjoyshow New Iran sanctions will benefit Putin, he has tons of oil that Exxon helped him retreive. Does anyone think Putin isn't going to to do ALL he can for Trump?
3657 2018-11-02 23:16:27 Yup. My husband and I have been growing our own weed since it became legal. He grows some great weed, but doesn't smoke but very rarely himself.  We started taking CBD oil recently, which you gotta try because IT'S AMAZING, but will soon make our own.
3658 2018-11-02 23:16:26 He's not adding to any problem, for example electric cars create more emissions due to cost of creating more electricity,nucLear facilities generate electricity. Hydrogen powered cars are the way to go,but that inventor was suddenly taken out years ago.due to oil wealth greed.

3719 2018-11-02 23:09:32 The saddest part is that it was done in secret without cities, towns, counties and possibly even the state of Texas is unaware of these wells. Now that fracking is being used to extract more oil, the possibilities of damaging the casing of these wells are almost certain to fail.

3799 2018-11-02 22:59:03 @NJTRANSIT did a conductor just say it’s ‘leaf season’ and if we run over them w/ steel wheels, it creates oil that could derail us? So by that logic, we should move at a snail’s pace for the next month. You guys need to get your house in order. It’s just getting sad now
3800 2018-11-02 22:58:47 I don’t believe he is listening. He is beholden to big pot and gun lobbyists. He wants Sen King to return $$ from oil companies, well how about Brakey returns that $16,000 check from the Canadian pot company?

3815 2018-11-02 22:56:00 I think we have the responsibility to look after our own backyard first. British Columbians are looking after the coast. Albertans should be looking after the tailings ponds and the tens of thousands of square kilometers of boreal forest damaged by oil exploration and production.
3816 2018-11-02 22:56:00 The US military does not represent the American people. They are slaves of corporations who are promoting corporate interests. Look where US troops are located. Oil, gas, rare minerals, used by corporations as justification for ownership. The people own this

3826 2018-11-02 22:54:43 Their nanny was a Nazi and Fred Koch, the father, worked in Germany to setup his patented oil refining technology. They’re not directly of Nazi German lineage. Jane Mayer’s Dark Money has a detailed background on the family. He also helped Stalin in USSR.

3830 2018-11-02 22:54:01 The cooking smell is the worse-taste wise they're not too bad. I tend to shred the blighters and fry in oil with garlic and panchetta-that disguises the smell a bit!! Still don't want them as a crisp flavour though!!
3831 2018-11-02 22:53:40 If that judge had real teeth, oil company execs also would be required to swim daily in the polluted waters - in thongs- and eat freshly caught fish every night.

3834 2018-11-02 22:53:24 Yea. I know what you mean. I’m like OK, I must take for oil change after work today. Good thing I did because battery was leaking and had to be replaced. It feels like a relief.
3835 2018-11-02 22:53:21 And cod liver oil!
3836 2018-11-02 22:53:05 So sad for you and Benny, Sandy. But it is tough to pay for the top insurance unless you have the finances. I'm giving our dog coconut oil regularly now, it's god for their joints too, hoping it will ward off problems later on. 
3837 2018-11-02 22:52:46 i just got my oil changed and car washed and i feel like a whole new person
3838 2018-11-02 22:52:26 Dude, it's getting warmer. The oil companies even know what is going on and what's causing it. I wish Corbett was right and the scientists I know who've spent decades on the science and evidence of it were wrong. I really do.
3839 2018-11-02 22:52:25 Do it, I've been using beard oil for about 5 years now and my beard is shiny. Get told how healthy it looks as well. I used argan oil after every night wash and my forest blend beard oil every morning

3859 2018-11-02 22:49:53 Because their present is a mere facade aimed at protecting their financial interests in the eventuality of diminished supply or demand on oil.  If the House of Saud is legitimately interested in improvement, they would probably need to denounce the wahhabist interpretation.
3860 2018-11-02 22:49:48 currently texting cisco is vegetable oil when she seriously going to school
3861 2018-11-02 22:49:43 Trump has allowed temporary waiver from its Iranian oil import sanctions  that go into effect on Monday to Turkey, China, India, Japan and South Korea. The move reflects US effort not to drive price of crude higher or poleaxing economies of allies.
3862 2018-11-02 22:49:31 I bought a lemon tree once. Tried to carry it but realised after a while my skin reacts badly to lemon oil, so I had to get on a bus instead. People took photos of me. It was a bit embarrassing.

3873 2018-11-02 22:47:43 Having worked retail and in kitchens I always had one of those days off. Figure it doesn’t put any burden on employers. Fishing boats, oil fields and truckers will need exceptions but with no reason absentee we can cover 99+% of folks.
3874 2018-11-02 22:47:43 I need a new beard oil. Anyone know some good shit?
3875 2018-11-02 22:47:37 So he's giving other countries more time to find another source for oil.  Wonder what country that will be?  He's creating another market for U.S. oil.  Like the old saying goes; follow the money.

3891 2018-11-02 22:46:01 Until a better energy source is found. Oil and Gas provides jobs, jobs provide food and shelter for many families.
The EPA can do it's job, so allow people to do theirs also.
It's not perfect, but it sustains human lives. So let's not forget humanity here...k?
3892 2018-11-02 22:45:59 Stop targeting me for your stupid ads. I literally work in climate change prevention- we all know this campaign is a scam so at the very least tell your big oil funders to stop wasting their ad dollars on people like me.
3893 2018-11-02 22:45:46 A lot of people depend on the jobs that comes from the oil & natural gas industry. I am 1 of them and I read an article recently that says that a lot of the materials used in solar panels are harmful to the environment as well.

In Q4 $CJ will be in a position of negative cash flow but they will borrow on their credit line to pay you the dividend. This will jeopardize the credit worthiness of the company which will be reflected in the value of the shares you hold.

3937 2018-11-02 22:38:50 I've talked to many people that ask me "Why should I order CBD oil from you when I can go to any head shop or tobacco store in town and buy it outright?"

Some of those places will pretty much sell ANYTHING they can fit on their shelves.

3941 2018-11-02 22:38:20 Putin isn’t broke.
He & his siloviki have gutted Russian economy & now he is the richest man on earth, controlling oil, gas, weapons, timber, trillions of carats of diamonds, $$billions from multiple org crime income streams.
It’s no laughing matter.
3942 2018-11-02 22:38:18 The Koch Bros. are the offspring of Fred C.

3947 2018-11-02 22:37:45 I was a rubio supporter, i would have voted him or cruz but because trump i left it blank. This conversation is killing me what are your thoughts on the nationalization of big oil.....
3948 2018-11-02 22:37:35 @AmbJohnBolton oil waivers - what a pussy you are. We thought you'd be harder on the mullahs. @AmbJohnBolton YOU ARE A PUSSY!!!
3949 2018-11-02 22:37:25 Do you seriously think anybody (except oil execs) would object to renewable energy if indeed it was cheaper, reliable and not fraught with big environmental problems of its own?  Why would they???  Electricity is electricity!...
3950 2018-11-02 22:37:16 We should all be shopping at @IcelandFoods.  They are the only supermarket with the balls to actually do something about the criminal production of palm oil.

3953 2018-11-02 22:36:53 @MarkMatsos Hello Dr. Matsos. There is a lot of talk in lupus support groups about using CBD oil isolate (NO thc) for lupus pains. Is this something that should be considered? Thank-you.
3954 2018-11-02 22:36:45 I could do with 'missing' a first oil change (£297.00) and a really poor customer experience at the showroom.

All show & no service. Really sad that it's come to this in an effort to portray MB as bring upmarket
3955 2018-11-02 22:36:43 I thought that was odd too. It’s supposed to be the cheese state and Kraft singles aren’t even really cheese it’s mostly oil and toxic preservatives

3957 2018-11-02 22:36:34 I was working on this lady's car and they really tried to charge her $183 for an oil change like what?! I had to say something and make them lower the price because that's tripping
3958 2018-11-02 22:36:31 I'm getting to the point where I want to put beard oil in my beard twice a day, not sure if that's a slippery road to obsession or just a lazy way of keeping things looking neat.

3961 2018-11-02 22:35:47 That's not it. Socialist Venezuela relied on high oil prices, and therefore high oil demand, in order to extract its higher-cost oil AND to fund government services. Now that oil demand  is lower, it can't export oil profitably or pay for its  gov services.
3962 2018-11-02 22:35:39 To those countries u mentioned is it inland the sources oil?
3963 2018-11-02 22:35:31 The most important factor N verifying the quality of the information is the validity of your source.If your source is your next door neighbor name Frida and she's trying to give you the way to Run Middle East oil subsidy policy there's probably a good chance you need a new source

3979 2018-11-02 22:33:29 Pre WW2 Germans turned coal oil into butter! Germany also saved the oil industry. (deal with Standard Oil) by mothballing its coal to oil technology. Ever wonder how WW2 Germany managed to survive using gasoline and diesel vehicles?

3981 2018-11-02 22:32:59 It’s about the oil getting warmed up and circulating in the engine especially on cold days.  Just better protects the engine through better lubrication.

Using this same soy to directly feed humans/produce oil would make more sense.

4001 2018-11-02 22:30:15 Thank you, Mr. Kenney. 

For the good of our whole country, it behooves us to understand the pipeline gridlock that is costing us billions, forcing oil to go even BY TRUCK, and now, is threatening to tear Canada apart.

Also Saudi Salman the hitman has got himself stuck in a pile of poop. Trumps happy because now he has him over a barrel. More oil or sanctions would be his tactic now.

4052 2018-11-02 22:23:34 @realDonaldTrump why allow them to buy oil again from Iran, how stupid it is. These six countries should not be exempted, this is a big mistake and will definitely affect the election
4053 2018-11-02 22:23:31 it seems to me that the narrative changes from week to week depending on what is going on, so the oil related stocks look like good candidates for swing trades... $wti had a great q3, so did $xom and $bp

You may add Evening primrose oil caps. 1 dly.

4057 2018-11-02 22:23:04 Yes yes and yes. Similar and worse, especially CBD oil and high THC flower. Consistent pressure and constructive feedback.
4058 2018-11-02 22:23:04 @realDonaldTrump I'm never a human being, I've never made a compromise in my life. I understand the exemptions of China and India, I just do not understand the exemptions of Japan and Korea, the two countries have cut off their oil

4076 2018-11-02 22:20:58 Yes excellent but also frustrating! Greenpeace is running campaigns against plastic pollution and another about the devastation caused by Palm oil companies. The RSPB has conservation campaigns. Bite Back is campaigning against the decimation of shark populations! Join 2gether?

4082 2018-11-02 22:19:24 Oil & gas contributes less than 1% of the workforce and less than 5% of overall GDP, while industries like tourism and outdoor recreation dwarf those numbers. @hickforco should be prioritizing the long term quality of life of Colorado over his buddies in oil & gas's bottomline.

4112 2018-11-02 22:16:20 Did you test that slogan on a focus group before you dribbled it out?  You really should’ve. It just makes you sound dumber than you look. Go back home, snake oil salesman.

4119 2018-11-02 22:15:28 Perhaps, but it shows that the optimism, always at it's highest when Republicans take office, is rarely reflected by reality.

If you want a government that works, you have to hire people who believe government can work - not the guy selling snake oil.

4158 2018-11-02 22:12:13 Liar .so why did you make an exception for 8 countries which are buy most of Iran's oil?
There is a philosophy; when you lie ,tell that so big even you can't ignore it and you yourself believe that. Such a shame for humanity.

4209 2018-11-02 22:05:40 It seems the Trump Administration has its eye on Native American lands, especially those w/protected mineral and oil rights. Native Americans have always had sovereignty over these lands. When researching Kavanaugh, I learned that Kavanaugh, Trump & Zinke are in agreement.
4210 2018-11-02 22:05:39 So the oil and gas companies give Australia almost $25 BILLION LESS than other exporting nations. Imagine that $ channelled into health, education, renewables. #auspol Governments must never let this disparity occur again.

4222 2018-11-02 22:04:36 afternoon oil should have been a hit but I can’t expect the Fandom At Large to have any taste 
4223 2018-11-02 22:04:31 Google hedgerow loss in the UK. Why do you assume most cleared land in the Amazon will not be farmed sustainably? Otherwise it would not be financially viable to clear. This is like the fuss over palm oil. People have a right to farm, if you disagree, buy a farm & plant hedgerow.
4224 2018-11-02 22:04:29 No! The Conservative Party has a better plan that doesn’t put Canadians into the poorhouse! Liberals selling snake oil!

4230 2018-11-02 22:03:41 So I tried the Butter Coffee fad a while back. It involved putting “grain fed” butter and coconut oil in your coffee, then blending the crap out of it.  It actually tasted pretty good, but got lots of strange looks.
4231 2018-11-02 22:03:33 Priest: how long has it been since your last confession?

4237 2018-11-02 22:03:00 9. China last year usurped US as largest #oil importer. It's not a market US producers want to be excluded. Annualized at a price of $80 per barrel, Chinese imports of US crude of roughly 500,000 barrels a day equate to $14.6 billion in trade. #USChinaForum2018 @TulaneLaw #OOTT

4240 2018-11-02 22:02:42 That was clear when the federal Conservatives expanded the TFW Program in Alberta during the oil boom. Apparently, the free market should decide wages until wages get too high and cut into profits; then you should be able to import cheap labour from poorer countries.

4242 2018-11-02 22:02:39 So disappointed in @Honda and @HondaCustSvc. Called today re my ‘07 accord that lost so much oil the timing chain stretched and bent all 16 valves - $3k damage. Piston ring failure is likely cause but, despite lifetime maintenance records, @Honda won’t help with cost
4243 2018-11-02 22:02:37 I actually feel for Spurs, a great record getting broke by a team that can spend 200 million on one player and a team backed by oil money
4244 2018-11-02 22:02:20 I have an idea for you Jason. Why don't you fly to Saudi Arabia and tell them to stop pumping oil. If you can get them to stop, the price will certainly go up and Alberta will once again prosper. Then fly to Washington and do the same. That's all you need to do. Simple!

4251 2018-11-02 22:01:36 Rosendale from Maryland? 

He's one of those GOP trying to have states take over federal land, with the ultimate goal of handing those lands over to oil & coal miners to do whatever damage they will, carving off a few prime sections for the rich friends as well.
4252 2018-11-02 22:01:32 People (including a stylist) have suggested argan oil... (when I expressly said I didn’t want my hair straightened.) but... I dunno I don’t think I’ve figured it out...

4267 2018-11-02 21:59:48 you figure there is more than one oil co in the US?
4268 2018-11-02 21:59:45 Need an oil change?  Come in for our $69.95 oil and filter change, or upgrade to a 5k service for $269.90!
4269 2018-11-02 21:59:43 Low taxes literally mean nothing at this point. 

We are not energy independent. Why do you think this ordeal with Saudi Arabia is so big. It isn’t just about the possibly murder. It’s about where countries will stand now that this oil giant has been caught up.
4270 2018-11-02 21:59:41 Didn’t get time even to review this picture in details... Call of duty.. kids/lunch .. but you are right it is a biased assumption..keep also in mind that all oil companies investing a lot  & trying to prove that environmental change is just a myth.

4275 2018-11-02 21:59:08 So the oil company receives your tax dollar up front with the subsidy, whether or not you drive a gas car, and also at the pump. looking at the graph, the small portion going to gas is roughly $40-50 Billion, and Tesla shorts are freaking out about $140M...
4276 2018-11-02 21:58:59 You’ve not been keeping up to date with what’s been happening with oil then?

4285 2018-11-02 21:57:34 Feh, let people go nuts making their own edibles with oil for now. If they eff-up that's their own bad. (not that i want it to happen)

Last thing I want is regulations and/or manufacturers being blaming for anything that goes wrong when humans screw up. Baby steps. Give it time.
4286 2018-11-02 21:57:34 What do you exactly mean saying “The global energy-oil-gas world order is changing, especially for two countries”?
4287 2018-11-02 21:57:29 Trump is a CRIMINAL.
He's an ILLEGTIMATE POTUS, installed by the International Organized Crime Mob & those who cooperate with them: i.e. the Mercers, Koch Bros, Murdoch, GOP, Big Oil, etc.
We need to hold all these thugs accountable for their crimes ASAP.
4288 2018-11-02 21:57:26 I think it makes sense. We have heard what Potus is saying, need to hear the other side.
It is fascinating to listen to Obama selling snake oil and reflect on the liberals challenging Potus's honesty. Hyp-o-crits.

4298 2018-11-02 21:56:28 Crazy idea here but do you think if you gave the people in poor countries the money instead of invaded that they would willingly let you take the oil? Just think about if you bypassed the oil COMPANIES and fed people how easy they would LET you take resources.
4299 2018-11-02 21:56:20 Ms May. So you’re ok wth Longueuil Quebec dumbing millions of gallons of raw sewage into St Lawrence river.

One million barrels of oil a day from Iran will be prohibited from the U.S. because of Trump admin sanctions. I'm no economist but less supply and more demand=< prices

Now we're coalition of 1
4306 2018-11-02 21:55:47 How long ago was it that we bemoaned oil being under $40? Then it wasn't going over $55 for decades....Now in the $60s it is a problem? Not for U.S. oil producers.

4314 2018-11-02 21:55:17 why is that crap? Venezuela is in mess because of their government's over reliance on oil, and their policy of printing money & raising minimum wage - a complete mismanagement of their economy. Any protesters are hit hard, torture/rape/violence. Foreign media agencies expelled.
4315 2018-11-02 21:54:48 In any commodity, restricting supply raises value of the commodity. Why is that different with oil. I smell crooked kickbacks to make the opposite happen with Canadian oil. BC, and SK are hurting because of this.
4316 2018-11-02 21:54:44 Nope. The IR required FFs, windmills, waterwheels, whale oil and biomass couldn't power it.
4317 2018-11-02 21:54:21 If you let the oil penetrate first 1-2 hrs then add water + conditioner and let it soak again for another hour detangling will be even easier and your hair will be less likely to snap from any dryness
4318 2018-11-02 21:54:16 Just saw a auto shop that advertised "Gluten free oil changes"

I'm curious what they think of synthetic oil blends
4319 2018-11-02 21:53:41 I hear palm oil eases the peppery feeling. Try it out bro, before you say Tunde doesn't look out for you.

4324 2018-11-02 21:53:07 Get a light oil (grapeseed oil is really good) and coat your hair with it. Then get a plastic bag and let your hair soak for a couple hours. Light oils are really good at making built up dirt slide off + really good for detangling.
4325 2018-11-02 21:53:01 You sell snake oil supplements. Your endorsement means little.
4326 2018-11-02 21:53:00 8. Overseas markets have never been more important for US oil and gas producers, and China is undeniably the most critical market in the world for energy exporters. #USChinaForum2018 @TulaneLaw #OOTT

4332 2018-11-02 21:52:18 Depends, freezing north with temps below 32, I would say yes, let the motor come to temp before you start stressing it. Same reasons why you guys have warm ups. So Flo, prob not, 30 seconds - 1 min get the fluids and oil thru it, good to go
4333 2018-11-02 21:52:01 We aren't going to be cleaning up the asset. The asset owners are. The thing you ignore is that Suncor, Imperial Oil, Cenovus etc....all have real assets and are committed to addressing those impacts. The analysis assumed these companies simply fell off the face of the earth
4334 2018-11-02 21:51:56 But you support the oil and gas drilling and logging and other attacks on nature, right? Because it's good for your wealthy buddies.
4335 2018-11-02 21:51:41 It’s like the ad against Lizzie Fletcher for being too friendly to oil companies

4357 2018-11-02 21:49:00 cuz they probably gonna buss case cuz they can get any lawyer in the world like that cuz oil speaks , i mean money talks
4358 2018-11-02 21:49:00 day trade on $UGAZ for a profit - ATM bull put on $UNG holding $KOLD  and $DWT shares as well. playing this oil move while remaining neutral on nat gas in the near term
4359 2018-11-02 21:48:52 you mean crude oil
4360 2018-11-02 21:48:45 Don’t do it!! These ppl charged me $47 for oil change and a flush and headlight replacement and didn’t even refill my coolant 
4361 2018-11-02 21:48:44 Apple oil**
4362 2018-11-02 21:48:35 I went in for an oil change and now my car needs $1000 worth of work. I really am having the worst week.
4363 2018-11-02 21:48:32 Not  sure y our leaders get carried away like this. Three buzz words stole their hearts: oil. potential. gas. And they ran to world
4364 2018-11-02 21:48:28 Maybe we should take their oil. I am sorry: liberate their oil and not burn it fo the whole world’s sake.
4365 2018-11-02 21:48:25 We are not going to lose! But if we need a back up plan then massive civil disobedience, walk out like the Goggle employees, march on Washington, boycotts like the 70s when oil and gas prices spiked, just keep hammering at them
4366 2018-11-02 21:48:09 Rub palm oil
4367 2018-11-02 21:47:53 Is changing the oil?
4368 2018-11-02 21:47:45 Used car salesman: It has self-changing oil.
Me:Looks like a oil leak
Salesman: Ta mate oh ta mah toe
4369 2018-11-02 21:47:40 再度、プロとはなんぞやw
4370 2018-11-02 21:47:07 Why tf does swiss miss have coconut oil in it?? Ya’ll tryns kill me??
4371 2018-11-02 21:47:06 smh lol go to the oil palace at castleton mall!
4372 2018-11-02 21:46:53 Bob sweating oil at the standoff had me loving it a ton
4373 2018-11-02 21:46:40 Older cars, then yes. Most new cars it isn't necessary as the oil is much better and oil delivery systems are vastly improved. I give mine about 30 seconds.
4374 2018-11-02 21:46:38 Too much oil 
4375 2018-11-02 21:46:33 Have you ever noticed that the same people that press for open borders are the same folks protesting the drilling of new wells & new subdivision construction? More people, more water, oil, gas, & housing is needed. More shopping centers, Big Box Stores, plastic bags & straws...
4376 2018-11-02 21:46:32 He’s one of the few people on that network telling the truth but you trumpers are oil in the waters of truth. You repel reality.
4377 2018-11-02 21:46:20 So turmeric will 100% stain skin (I have yellow undertones so this actually works for me lol) but it can be taken off with an oil or yogurt base. People will mix it with plain Greek yogurt and that helps, I just do turmeric, water, and some honey and remove excess stain with oil
4378 2018-11-02 21:46:07  Yes we need the gas prices to go down! That would be wonderful! Especially for fuel oil in the cold winters!
4379 2018-11-02 21:46:03 Ashe looks great and she might be another main I put under my belt, but I’m also real excited for that new Omnic support hero. Also lol @ Omnics sweating oil
4380 2018-11-02 21:45:45 If your car has a warranty... not doing oil changes on time can void it.
4381 2018-11-02 21:45:43 I think it’s those either without oil, or those whose countries don’t offer an access to oil?
4382 2018-11-02 21:45:32 Nice graphics but GOT was fiction. In reality, you’ve already given wavers to 8  countries to keep buying oil and EU has set up an alternate payment system for transactions with Iran which will be legal on November 4th. EU is ignoring you and I’m loving it.
4383 2018-11-02 21:45:19 I was forced to have a flu shot  today! I was basically told to get it or quit my job as a therapist in a Nursing home. I wasn’t even allowed to wear a   instead. I will be taking extra drops of #CBD oil today to prevent my #myalgia from acting up! #VaccineInjury
4384 2018-11-02 21:45:15 One cannot do without tea and cookies! Like the sun and the moon! Water and oil!
4385 2018-11-02 21:45:05 Brexit the midnight oil
4386 2018-11-02 21:44:52 I took the liberty of restarting my oil heater by myself... the house will probably burn down in an hour, so I guess I’ll shower while it’s hot that way I at least die clean
4387 2018-11-02 21:44:49 And big oil is focusing more on plastics as supply & demand are slowly going down.
4388 2018-11-02 21:44:45 Shout out to Sweeney oil delivering heating oil this late at night
4389 2018-11-02 21:44:25 หลังจากนี้จะเก็บให้เก่งขึ้นเพื่อนำไปเที่ยวและบริจาคให้สถานสงเคราะห์สุนัขและแมวเดือนละ2000 ทำทุกอย่างให้ดีที่สุดในตอนที่พ่อแม่ยังอยู่ ไม่รู้ทำไมต้องเที่ยว แต่ยึดถือประโยคนึง ทำทุกวัน ให้เหมือนวันสุดท้ายที่จะมีชีวิตอยู่ เที่ยวไปเถอะ กินไปเถอะ เสพความสุขไปเยอะๆ เอาให้คุ้มม
4390 2018-11-02 21:44:22 Maybe  it’s starting to feel better-ish. I drank a lot of water w my lemon oil in it. It’s just my ears now . But you can still come over!!! I’ll be at the new house starting to unpack a bit and hopefully arrange everything  and I’ll have the pups and you could bring Mabel!
4391 2018-11-02 21:43:58 100$ on oil changes lord I gotta make that a damn bill as well 
4392 2018-11-02 21:43:46 anytime anyone suggests coconut oil somewhere in their beauty routine I automatically begin to ignore them lmao
4393 2018-11-02 21:43:44 Indonesia menempati peringkat 1 dalam produk pertanian,
yaitu : cengkeh (cloves) & pala (nutmeg), serta no.2 dalam karet
alam (Natural Rubber) dan minyak sawit mentah (Crude Palm Oil).
4394 2018-11-02 21:43:44 it smells like olive oil outside
4395 2018-11-02 21:43:41 had a little anxiety attack @ work today & my co worker gave me a drop of her cbd oil & my life has now been changed
4396 2018-11-02 21:43:37 if you just put coconut oil in your hair for like 45 mins that should work thats what i usually do
4397 2018-11-02 21:43:12 Why are we importing cooking oil?
4398 2018-11-02 21:43:10 Just have the oil n shit
4399 2018-11-02 21:43:08 There’s always something extra wrong when you go in for an oil change 
4400 2018-11-02 21:43:01 Have you ever tried hyaluronic acid? I used to be an oil slick and that stopped that immediately
4401 2018-11-02 21:42:58 Doubtful as long as the oil and the money keep flowing to Britain & the U.S.
4402 2018-11-02 21:42:56 These engine oil salesmen at gas stations always make me feel like a red woman passing a construction site.Leave me aloneeeeeeeeee
4403 2018-11-02 21:42:53 After noticing this yesterday arvo I have spent the entire time since lying on the floor in the foetal position speaking gibberish #earlycrisispoint u worked out what it is Baz (apart from inside oil on the outside)
4404 2018-11-02 21:42:51 Dems are bad for the stock market?  I think thats something GOP wants you to think.  Bring some stats!  Let’s say oil plummets(demand!), that alone is great for our economy esp lower/mid class.  Low oil the real tax break.  2014 drop fueled second rally
4405 2018-11-02 21:42:42 THC Oil (cannabis oil). I'm not sure why I stopped dreaming when I started using it. But I definitely sleep deeper and better than ever before.
4406 2018-11-02 21:42:38 I use urban skin rx, vitamin e oil, and a  brown sugar and almond oil scrub
4407 2018-11-02 21:42:36 Cause some bitches don’t even be knowing what to do if their car is getting to hot. Don’t even know how to check they oil.  and that’s just sad.
4408 2018-11-02 21:42:31 Obviously I would laugh but I wouldn't want this kind of thing to happen to a club like Liverpool, Arsenal etc.
But City? Fuck them. Hope they're forced to liquidate. Entire club is built on oil and plastic. Nothing real about it
4409 2018-11-02 21:42:23 It’s the olive oil...it’s smearing the screen
4410 2018-11-02 21:42:14 Kkkkkk yoir dreams are big baba.. Did you hear kuti Chiwenga has been appointed by the President to Run the Research industry after that oil has been discovered.. remember kuti he was part of missing 15 Billion.
4411 2018-11-02 21:42:11 getting burned by an oil splash while frying something.
4412 2018-11-02 21:42:03 Oh so now ED is now a geologist I see too bad no oil has been discovered
4413 2018-11-02 21:42:02 When its exactly 2am, go to any t-junction in your street, put on a white wrapper, let there be palm oil on your palm! Them shout "eyin Iya mi o" when they appear to you, tell them, I'm sure the next morning, you will be in Toronto Canada
4414 2018-11-02 21:41:53 Trump has no idea whether they are Indian, Red Indian or Martian, what's more, he doesn't care. What he does care about is and in 1993 that was Casinos, he would paint himself up if he thought it would get him an edge.
Now he wants the oil in N/Dakota, not Indian anymore, eh
4415 2018-11-02 21:41:39 *slather in baby oil* "ENHANCE!!!"
4416 2018-11-02 21:41:38 Question is that ink or oil
4417 2018-11-02 21:41:17 Of course! Just placed an order for my 3rd bottle of Garden Fairy Beauty Oil. It has literally saved my face! I love how smooth and clear my skin has been since using it.
4418 2018-11-02 21:41:16 Beard oil is the key.
4419 2018-11-02 21:41:10 Common ingredients in a few extra cooking oil.
4420 2018-11-02 21:41:08 Balsamic vinegar, olive oil, fresh garlic, parsley, salt, pepper marinade a couple hours. 
4421 2018-11-02 21:41:06 The tankers that bring oil to NZ are out of sight to most of us. About 1 huge tanker full per week to be turned into carbon emissions. About 15% of our total import bill. Renewables, electrification of rail and more PT and cycling will make us more self sufficient.
4422 2018-11-02 21:41:00 7. US is now the world’s largest oil & gas producer, with #oil production of 11 M/bd & #natgas output of 94 Bcf/d. With production forecast to grow further, every incremental barrel of oil and most Btus of gas will need to be exported somewhere. #USChinaForum2018 @TulaneLaw
4423 2018-11-02 21:41:00 the oil change?
4424 2018-11-02 21:40:52 Doctor : O jeleng?
Her : Ke jele KFC le Doritos Go slo ene fedile..nedile monate jwang...
Doctor : Ausi ketlao tlohela oshwe if osa bue nnete oswabe nou nou
Her : Ke jele papa ka fish oil....
4425 2018-11-02 21:40:50 You be ghost? How do you walk in on closed doors biko. Too much dodo but little oil for frying smh
4426 2018-11-02 21:40:48 What did you expect from that snake oil douche?? He used the same tactics on hundreds of women and ended up with HIV. Lakers gonna have the same fate.
4427 2018-11-02 21:40:40 Zimbabwe discovers oil? No people, stop ! Did the oil or gas deposits just wait for Uncle Bob to go for them to materialise?!  A re naganeng.... 
4428 2018-11-02 21:40:36 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
4429 2018-11-02 21:40:35 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
4430 2018-11-02 21:40:29 Has there been any legit unionist explanation for this disparity, other than Scottish Oil is shit? 
4431 2018-11-02 21:40:26 リーダータバコは体に良くないッスよー？
4432 2018-11-02 21:40:24 Well I’m no expert but I’m sure there’s an essential oil for it that’ll at least help a bit, in combination with other things
4433 2018-11-02 21:40:22 Ask you a question about apex 500mg and 1000mg oil cartilages. Same weight?  One gram in each cartilage?
4434 2018-11-02 21:40:18 Don’t forget peanut oil.
4435 2018-11-02 21:40:08 油を固めて捨てるの面倒でしょう？僕に渡してくれたらいいよ。あ、固めて渡してくれてもいいよ。
4436 2018-11-02 21:40:06 The oil is on sale for $5.49 at beauty exchange
4437 2018-11-02 21:40:02 1.

Some facts to add.  USA nationalized industries World War 1, World War 2.

Truman discussed importance of coal while President. I recommend use his quotes.

Oil far more important to Iran than oil to USA.

Eisenhower chose to overthrow friend Iran because of oil.
4438 2018-11-02 21:39:56 I love everything about this video.  From Jennifer Hale doing  Ashe's voice, to the classic western showdown music, to Bob the omnic  with a stick on beard and bead of oil sweat.  McCree is my favorite DPS, but Ashe might change that! :P
4439 2018-11-02 21:39:54 Bread and Èrún Akara (akara crumbs); that one that scatters on the face of the oil, it beats the Akara itself...i used to go book that luscious thing. Best served in between today's bread. We call it risky burger cos it's a roadside meal. 
4440 2018-11-02 21:39:54 The oil companies want to indoctrinate school  children with Marxism.
4441 2018-11-02 21:39:45 for real: when Mr. Drumpf starts whining, his staff dreams about being a #Democrat
4442 2018-11-02 21:39:31 Got made fun of for using oil/balm in my beard at work today....good luck having a face that looks like you glued pubic hair to your face buddy 
4443 2018-11-02 21:39:26 They’re gonna commiserate over tea (well, oil for BOB) about how their skinny white girl best friends are too reckless and make them worry
4444 2018-11-02 21:39:06 I bathed my hair in coconut oil and is alive again thank god
4445 2018-11-02 21:38:54 first oil change, then a wash .. gotta take care of my big boy
4446 2018-11-02 21:38:36 I want to eat the chicken strips I ordered, but it’s too quiet here in Nissan.  (I’m waiting for my car to get an oil change). 
4447 2018-11-02 21:38:36  Iran’s main export is oil they want to sell it América doesn’t want Iran to sell its biggest export . How is this the Iranian governments fault? Surely it’s sensible to want to sell your biggest domestic product to the rest of the world ?
4448 2018-11-02 21:38:27 SANA OIL
4449 2018-11-02 21:38:25 I eat meat. But what you say is non-sense. Diabetes is also quite high in places which eat meat. In Kashmir, people eat lots of meat( lamb, chicken), yet Diabetes is high there- reason sugar, cola, fruit juices, refined sunflower oil and factory peeled refined white rice.
4450 2018-11-02 21:38:17 Chiwenga now in charge of the research.. Stripped off Defense ministry.. in shot.. atorerwa power ye military akapiwa mukana sekuti abe makumari kana oil iyo iriko.. ndopakunzi 15 billiin yashaikwa
4451 2018-11-02 21:38:16 I'm not normal lol, but that's how I've felt generally since I started taking CBD oil. I still have some kind of bad days but they're few and far between now. Stuff is amazing.
4452 2018-11-02 21:38:14 Now why would US Christian Evangelicals be meeting with a foreign government, an enemy of the current administration & US Citizens  (POTUS oil tweets), who supports Islam and beheadings of Arab Christians and is anti-Israel?
4453 2018-11-02 21:38:14 Make a pizza! Use a base of sun-dried tomato oil and feta, add blue cheese crumbles and bake. Top with crushed peanuts.
4454 2018-11-02 21:38:13 sorry sir!
which contury start this war?
and why?
for money?
for oil?
or...

for sell guns?
4455 2018-11-02 21:38:00 6. No emerging market is more critical to the global oil industry than China, the world’s biggest driver of demand growth, and the United States, before the trade war, had been making sizable inroads into China's oil and gas markets. #USChinaForum2018 @TulaneLaw
4456 2018-11-02 21:37:59 Snake Oil.
4457 2018-11-02 21:37:49 The failed embargo provided castro the political fuel to stay in power for over half a century. The man laughed at the US al the way to his grave. Perhaps we could be less hypocritical & stop purchasing millions of barrels of oil from and stop enriching Venezuela's Maduro
4458 2018-11-02 21:37:47 I really do need a fucking oil change damn @wavyhills
4459 2018-11-02 21:37:34 Trump will put sanction on Iran oil industry.This sanction will be massive effect on Iran economy since oil industry make up 70% of Iran economy and half of the government revenue.
4460 2018-11-02 21:37:34 Diffusing peppermint oil...
4461 2018-11-02 21:37:33 All this artist that got married and their career died instantly...  Hmm I wonder if the wife dem no get oil for head...  Abi all d love song Don finish for dem head.....  Eg psquare, Banky wells
4462 2018-11-02 21:37:27 Oil.
4463 2018-11-02 21:37:25 มีเงินพร้อมจะไปเที่ยวไหนก็ได้ แต่ไม่มีเวลาแล้ว ต้องทำงานๆๆๆๆ ยาวๆๆๆๆ + ขายของนิดหน่อย ถ้าของหมดก็คงไม่ได้ขายแล้ว เริ่มสนุก งานประจำ+ฟรีแลนด์+ขายของ โอ้โหหสุดยอด สนุกทุกแบบเลยว่ะ ถ้ามีเวลามากพอ จะพาตัวเองไปทะเลกับภูเขาอีกนะ แต่ถ้ามีเงินมากพอและมีเวลาไปยุโรปเลยดีป่ะ ตอนนี้ขอมโนก่อน
4464 2018-11-02 21:37:10 That caters to Rail, Bus, Air, Sea and Land. We can’t just cater to air and land and neglect our rail, bus, sea transportation options. We have a congress which takes more money from big Oil which in turn contributes to the problem. Can these systems depend less on federal
4465 2018-11-02 21:36:55 and then you use anti-oil face products and your skin is like "oh man that was close we almost ran out of face oil but don't worry i started making 200% more to make up for it"
4466 2018-11-02 21:36:52 Lmao heather is still trying to get me to download it 
4467 2018-11-02 21:36:46 He’s as popular as Joffrey baretheon . Do you think the trade war with China is a ploy to put pressure on China not to buy Iranian oil that will ultimately not work
4468 2018-11-02 21:36:44 Simplest explanation ever you will blow your enginevup. It needs oil to run because that’s the lubricant for the engine
4469 2018-11-02 21:36:35 Can someone pls oil my scalp
4470 2018-11-02 21:36:21 Mais oui! Or should I say, oil, ci est! 800 year-old Anglo Norman dialect
4471 2018-11-02 21:36:14 宏々さんおはごです！
4472 2018-11-02 21:36:13 Niggas be thinking they slick , Bitch I’m Baby oil 
4473 2018-11-02 21:36:03 Because he need oil
4474 2018-11-02 21:35:59 Guys stop comparing us to Man City they are owned and funded by a Sovereign state who supply 10% of the worlds oil. They have an unlimited budget and are by far the wealthiest sporting club in the world. Therefore let’s concentrate on our selves and try and compete with the rest!
4475 2018-11-02 21:35:54 He was "pro oil" ... what Harper wasn't was "pro-consultation".  He just wanted to ignore any kind of comprehensive process.  He viewed interested parties as obstacles to be overruled or silenced.
4476 2018-11-02 21:35:52 oil dey your head. booooooooooooooom
4477 2018-11-02 21:35:45 I used to drive my old car at times when there was literally not a drop of oil in it. That was such a loyal car, and she’s still going.
4478 2018-11-02 21:35:44 Tragically it is US policies towards oil rich Honduras that have turned the country into a chaotic state:  the ‘caravan’ has been created in ways not unlike the huge migrant column thru Turkey to Europe shaped by Russia and ISIS
4479 2018-11-02 21:35:40 Sure would love to know how many big oil risk management teams went all in on Oct 1st and 2nd. Hmmm...
4480 2018-11-02 21:35:39 Toasted sourdough, poached eggs. Chopped tomatoes, olive oil, salt and pepper. Breakfast. (Portobello residents may add smashed avocado..)
4481 2018-11-02 21:35:22 I think it looks darn good. Paint chips would be in order with all the natural sandblasting of the environment and things tend to rust darker in low humid areas than the bright red rust of wetter areas. T's were oil spewing machines so I'd imagine a fair amount of wet-oily/sand.
4482 2018-11-02 21:35:18 いってきます、、
4483 2018-11-02 21:35:14 So are these types of ads/messages being put up in the Nile, Niger, Yangtze, Yrllow, Ganges, and Brahmaputra watersheds, cuz that’s where most of the plastic trash comes from.
4484 2018-11-02 21:35:01 It's nice to hear you're up for investing in solutions. It can be frustrating when people cling to oil as the one and only path to a good economy.
4485 2018-11-02 21:34:52 Which que juice y’all like better oil (purple) or lap (gold) 
4486 2018-11-02 21:34:52 Finally got my oil changed 
4487 2018-11-02 21:34:48 Reward or looking for ways to make him disappear??
4488 2018-11-02 21:34:33 Ikr like it love knowing where my olive oil comes from but my other faves are in rehab and dead C’MON ZOOEY
4489 2018-11-02 21:34:33 They will liberate you from the oil they won't declare war 
4490 2018-11-02 21:34:09 Maybe you should have started years ago then. We can’t afford to have no environment left with continued pollution from oil and gas.
4491 2018-11-02 21:34:03 I need a full body oil massage x a blunt 
4492 2018-11-02 21:33:55 This chart is from your link...only a small portion of that is for gas, mostly it is for heating oil and electricity generation.  On the other hand, gas taxes support the road infrastructure used by all vehicles.
4493 2018-11-02 21:33:47 I would buy oil for my son for the upcoming winter.
4494 2018-11-02 21:33:44 Finally got my brakes done and oil changed. Now I gotta just do this damn emission test.
4495 2018-11-02 21:33:43 Bullshit dan, what was that bag of shit oil company a few years ago that ended up being a duster!
4496 2018-11-02 21:33:40 The first ingredient in that “cleansing oil” is literally soybean oil
4497 2018-11-02 21:33:34 No matter what kind of car issue I call my dad about his response is “Well have you had your oil changed?” 
4498 2018-11-02 21:33:29 It's funny because I found a magazine at Walmart with bts on it so I bought it
4499 2018-11-02 21:33:29 You mean i’ll be close minded one day and not want to open my door to those in need? Or that I will care more about oil than my grand children? Or i’ll care more about more money than people?
4500 2018-11-02 21:33:27 Castor oil will make your hair thicccccc
4501 2018-11-02 21:33:17 I believe road safety is your mandate, pedestrian  welfare is paramount. I am concerned with the safety of pedestrians at the zebra crossing to and from Kapa oil. Any plans for a foot bridge? cc

4503 2018-11-02 21:32:37 Argon oil that you use in your hair is made from the poop of tree goats in Morocco.
4504 2018-11-02 21:32:28 Being fine is such a plus when you gotta get a oil change 
4505 2018-11-02 21:32:19 This is VENEZUELA and that’s no oil coming out of the faucet, supposed to be water!
4506 2018-11-02 21:32:13 Reading Heinlein is a strange activity, like looking at an oil spill or broken glass. Every new paragraph brings some new disgusting "humans are lifestock" angle to light, and yet there is something pleasing about the way the light bounces off the cutting edges and iridescence.

4508 2018-11-02 21:31:48 In the aftermath of Arab Israel war in 1973 & the oil shock, there was a surge of Islamic sentiment in the Muslim world.

Saudia stopped giving visas for Hajj to Ahmedis. JI n mullahs added feul.
4509 2018-11-02 21:31:37 Yea man I feel ya on that. It tastes like a 9-volt battery leaked in an old oil pan and I decided to lick it for whatever reason. But after finally trying The Last Dab Reduxx I can officially say that it is a quality sauce  big fan!
4510 2018-11-02 21:31:29 .... skanky ‘hi probably prefers the smell of the Arab’s refined oil
4511 2018-11-02 21:31:15 Coconut oil is by far the best make up remover
4512 2018-11-02 21:31:14 1971 convinced Bhutto sb that Generals cant defend Pakistan. So he took it upon him. He concluded that only Nuclear deterrence can save Pak from India. But Pak didnt hv the money.Seeing the glut of money coming 2 Arab world following the oil embargo of 1973, he decided 2 tap it.
4513 2018-11-02 21:30:55 This one spill pass naija crude oil.
4514 2018-11-02 21:30:27 Well I’d like a job when I graduate so I can pay off these loans
4515 2018-11-02 21:30:17 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。
4516 2018-11-02 21:30:01 It’s cause the oil thins up when it’s warmed up and the motor can operate easier.
4517 2018-11-02 21:29:53 He won’t wrestle anymore. Just made an appearance so the fans(billionaire oil  guys) were happy since it was in their country

4519 2018-11-02 21:29:40 Baby oil may give you a smoother rotation,   but don't use too much don't want you to go flying off the pole. 
4520 2018-11-02 21:29:35 Why not? Non-partisan, independent studies say there is enough oil in U.S. to last over 200 years. You cant bitch about gas prices if you're allowing OPEC to be that big of a factor. Oil prices were low at end of Obama's term because OPEC flooded supply to bankrupt U.S. oil firms
4521 2018-11-02 21:29:33 Coconut oil, our best friend and hero forever <3
4522 2018-11-02 21:29:33 I cut & sliced up 3 plantains last night. I added coonut oil to the glass pan b/f placing the slices of plantains on there. I decided to taste one, but I kept tasting until et was all gone. I had 3 more, so I cut them up & baked but didn't taste those. I'm eating em right now.
4523 2018-11-02 21:29:28 Stop buying their oil
4524 2018-11-02 21:29:20 i'd probably cook some rice with a little bit of oil to make white fried rice and just add that chopped up in there at the last 3-5 mins of cooking.
4525 2018-11-02 21:29:12 I recommend CBD oil for dogs that freak out because of the fireworks. We now have a very zen pooch with the munchies.

4526 2018-11-02 21:28:55 getting an oil change is literally the most boring thing in the world
4527 2018-11-02 21:28:52 I put a little bit of baby oil on my face then tan x
4528 2018-11-02 21:28:16 My oil change was less than I thought  favor been showing off this week!
4529 2018-11-02 21:28:12 & Stop importing their oil
4530 2018-11-02 21:28:04 Vince bought crack with that Saudi Oil money apparently.
4531 2018-11-02 21:28:01 Oil prices continued to slide during the week, with Brent crude down at about $73. One factor depressing prices was a report from Bloomberg, that the Trump administration had decided to grant temporary waivers to allow 8 countries, to continue buying some oil from Iran when #OOTT
4532 2018-11-02 21:27:55 Sadly everybody knows that none of these questions will be answered,Saudı Arabia will continue to kill brutally,Western leaders will continue to remain silent.
This is called the power of oil.
4533 2018-11-02 21:27:50 Hi ho Silver and away (in a cloud of soot). I hope oil burners gave had their day. At least strokers smelt nice & sounded exciting
4534 2018-11-02 21:27:41 Black people see Trump for the con man, snake oil salesman, liar and Putin-Puppet he is. His policies disenfranchise them and other minorities. Black people would be "stupid" if they did for him. Looking at you @kanyewest
4535 2018-11-02 21:27:40 Es como las compañías de cable o celular. Dejando todo liberado, si es rentable, van a aparecer nuevas empresas. Ej, Petrobras, oil, etc. Y con las cosas elementales sucede de la misma manera. O la gente ultimamente no está consumiendo más pollo porque la carne es más cara?
4536 2018-11-02 21:27:38 WHY MY WHOLE FAMILY OUT HERE LETTING ME THINK ITS CALLED A GREASE OIL CHANGE TF
4537 2018-11-02 21:27:33 I find it amusing that Erdogan looking for justice What does he know about it. Is not he the one  buying oil from ISIS.  Is not he the one treating injured ISIS in his hospitals Is not he the one doing money laundry and the head of his operation is in US  jail????
4538 2018-11-02 21:27:32 I just started using coconut oil as my moisturizer and my skin has NEVER looked better so idk
4539 2018-11-02 21:27:28 They don't get help because the Venezuelan government are named as pariah state by Trump, as the USA does not need Venezuelan oil anymore so the people do not matter
4540 2018-11-02 21:27:19 @jeep Buyer beware: I bought a 2019 Cherokee, and in three weeks it’s had to go into repairs for multiple days TWICE! Once for a dangerous issue. Jeep offered me four oil changes for the trouble, danger, missed work, etc. No empathy or desire to make it right!
4541 2018-11-02 21:27:01 Very disappointed to find that upon inspection today, it’s (near) impossible to find a lunch time sandwich that does not contain palm oil. @Tesco #PalmOil Why?

4543 2018-11-02 21:26:43 Yes. Let the engine settle. Allow the oil and fluids to run through the system.
4544 2018-11-02 21:26:35 Exxon, Chevron Profits Soar as Big Oil Returns to Dominance

Exxon Mobil and Chevron each reported their highest third-quarter profit in four years as the world’s largest oil companies appeared to have finally shaken off the malaise of a yearslong oil-price crash.
4545 2018-11-02 21:26:18 Climate breakdown. Prioritise this please. Make @nzlabour face up to the future.
Much stronger commitment to quick break with oil & gas, also animal agriculture.
Synthetic milk.
Stop attracting flown-in tourists.
Need clear routes to alternatives.
Make all NZers talk about this.
4546 2018-11-02 21:25:52 Indeed we will. Democrats have three days to put together a campaign that’s more than Trump is Evil. I’d be burning the midnight oil.
4547 2018-11-02 21:25:45 Oil cunts
4548 2018-11-02 21:25:44 10 barrels of OIL + 4 grams of HIV cure = 40 hours of drama
4549 2018-11-02 21:25:37 my heating oil is gone so I'm putting on a fire and waiting for the place to warm up a lil. Hopefully internet sorts itself out by then too!
I should be back online soon :)
4550 2018-11-02 21:25:33 I need oil
4551 2018-11-02 21:25:26 If CID managed to raid Magaya after the press conference then what’s going to happen to the Muzarabani Oil press conference convener
4552 2018-11-02 21:25:25 I'm not vote shaming anyone. I'm telling you THIS IS NOT THE TIME. You give this to Mike DeWine, Ohio will lose their public schools, he'll ax Medicare expansion, gas/oil companies will have us dealing with earthquakes in no time. He is no John Kasich! We need a fairer Gov.
4553 2018-11-02 21:25:24 some interesting bits you could pick out.. Rice/lentils per kg 
Black eyed beans (another seems high)
 Sunflower oil, cous cous etc
(no brand name vs another retailer seem very high)

Others seem spot on, but they would be Irish brands and probably not sought after as much IYGM.
4554 2018-11-02 21:25:21 Coconut oil is on standby. I got chu gurrl.

4558 2018-11-02 21:24:53 School me brother have not heard a landlocked country with oil in my life time.
4559 2018-11-02 21:24:37 Wasn't it just stealing the oil tanker? How did you even play part 4 without it?

4561 2018-11-02 21:24:28 I thought they said they found cooking oil in Muzarabani. I am confused as well

4565 2018-11-02 21:24:23 Dispersants Ineffective in Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill - 3,000 tons of dispersant was used to push back the spread of oil and dissolve its particles, but was rendered ineffective due to the depth of the oil. It may have suppressed the growth of oil degrading bacteria and mad…
4566 2018-11-02 21:24:15 I've never been to the gulf of Mexico personally but you seem like you've got the personality of the BP oil spill
4567 2018-11-02 21:24:13 They should make oil the color of blood. That way, you can know when to get really concerned! 
4568 2018-11-02 21:24:04 tuh! i put on coconut oil!

4571 2018-11-02 21:24:00 yes.  Cruz is acting like a finisher....he is the NE Patriots, not the Atlanta Falcons....
4572 2018-11-02 21:23:41 Defo. Why else would we give a world cup to gas rich Russia or oil rich Qatar? 
4573 2018-11-02 21:23:37 Dealership mechanic: Your car needs all of these parts changed otherwise you’ll be put in a potential dangerous situation if you go back on the road while driving.

4580 2018-11-02 21:22:01 I topped up the engine oil in my car today and she didn’t explode, so basically now I am....... A Mechanic
4581 2018-11-02 21:21:53 If the democrats win the Midterms, the Oil 100% is going to rally. Because they are not interested in the cheap industry so thry will not move with the Bill against OPEC. But the Other problem is the Khachoggi affair. Trump use it to control Saudi Arabia.
4582 2018-11-02 21:21:52 Obama was a snake oil salesman
4583 2018-11-02 21:21:48 Destroyed by Ivan .... So Why did BP $ pay for this Lodge if it wasn’t destroyed by the oil spill? Why did this $ not go to those businesses that WERE damaged or destroyed??? I recall going to the beach long after the spill & workers were still clearing tar balls from the sand.
4584 2018-11-02 21:21:43 Boogie and Olive oil ( if you watched popeye you know what olive oil look like).

4599 2018-11-02 21:20:11 From Donna: We just received our 2nd bottle. My husband has an issue in his feet from chemo he received two years ago. Since using the oil, he's getting the feeling back in his feet! This oil is amazing!

4600 2018-11-02 21:19:47 Or oil?
4601 2018-11-02 21:19:34 4 new tires... & yes this is news! Just like it was when I got my tags renewed... check back for oil change updates 
4602 2018-11-02 21:19:15 Frankincense oil can reduce blemishes but your best bet is Shea butter or vitamin e oil. Rub it on your skin at night if you’re not tryna be too shiny during the day.
4603 2018-11-02 21:19:10 Just heard about the Man City PSG FFP breaching cover up! Ultimate corruption that is! Points deduction is needed for both if caught again as heavy fines are a hobby for them! A points deduction would seriously hit them in their oil heart!

4607 2018-11-02 21:18:49 For someone who claims to be a man of faith. Cheap, paranoid snake oil approach, suggesting Beto is paying for the caravan. God is watching and will evaluate in the end.

4609 2018-11-02 21:18:17 Only real buff es el Oil panic tbh
4610 2018-11-02 21:18:13 Much Beto vs. Cruz news: Polls, PACs, Project Veritas videos & more; Important Texas House speaker race news; Border security news; Oil & gas rig count update + the news of Texas, 5 to 7pm on Pratt on Texas.
4611 2018-11-02 21:18:11 Lol. Good to know. I'm just starting my dresser collection. My dermatologist reminded me to label them so they don't "accidentally" get back into the kitchen. I think anyone who comes to my bedroom or bathroom looking for vinegar & olive oil deserves what they get! 
4612 2018-11-02 21:18:05 4. In the US oil services sector, materials costs are up more than 8% from a year ago and still trending higher -- in a market that has not yet fully recovered from the oil price collapse of 2014. #USChinaForum2018 @TulaneLaw

4627 2018-11-02 21:16:35 It is after this further exploration and a detailed fesibility study that economic viability of this project is going to be determined.

It is true that oil was discovered, but it may be early to say that its economically viable.

4638 2018-11-02 21:14:41 Why would they cook burgers in oil? Doesn’t happen. Burgers have their own fat content, there is no need to use vegetable oils on the grille. I go to A&W all the time and order patties and it’s been mummy saving grace when needing something affordable, quick and healthy.

4640 2018-11-02 21:14:27 Discovering oil doesn't mean an extraction project will be economically viable.

After discovery, further exploration is done to define the resource. That's why Invictus is going to sink an Exploration Well.
4641 2018-11-02 21:14:25 Vitamin e oil and coconut oil! they’re both super good for your skin anyway  My boobs grew super fast when I went through puberty and got a few stretch marks and I used mederma scar treatment and they went away! It’s spendy for a little tube but it worked so well!

4643 2018-11-02 21:14:16 But then you technically still don’t have the oil change 
4644 2018-11-02 21:14:12 What brand of oil did you take, how many drop and how long did you take it?

4648 2018-11-02 21:13:35 Home Remedy for Yeast Infection

You need :
# A big bowl you can seat in comfortably
# 3 Tablespoons of ACV with Mother

Pour ACV, Oil and Water into the bowl and seat in it for 5 mins.

4650 2018-11-02 21:13:21 He taught me to fear oil cans.
4651 2018-11-02 21:12:57 What brand of oil did you take, how many drops did you take and how long did you take it?
4652 2018-11-02 21:12:57 Maybe it's a threat?

4657 2018-11-02 21:11:58 All these rumours about PSG and City, do we really want oil men to own United?
4658 2018-11-02 21:11:48 Most of the weeds in your yard have medicinal uses. Dandelions and olive oil steeped for six weeks in a jar makes a super potent muscle relaxing topical oil.
4659 2018-11-02 21:11:46 the oil on that damn pillar made me smell like lube for a week

4664 2018-11-02 21:11:31 $2.59??  I just paid $2.45 and still think that's too high.  As a matter of fact, anything over $2 is too much for the largest oil producing country in the world.
4665 2018-11-02 21:11:28 Bruhhhh the coconut oil issa trap hahahahaha
4666 2018-11-02 21:11:28 Brutal regime, it's time to get them in the 21st century or kick them to the curb, we don't need their oil, they're sick
4667 2018-11-02 21:11:12 Pretending the majority of agriculture is for feeding cattle is a pretty stupid sell. Regardless, how is your food grown? How much land and oil based fertiliser does it require? How many animals /ecosystems does it displace?
4668 2018-11-02 21:11:04 You spread the table before me

4671 2018-11-02 21:10:53 in the case of basil though rub clean dry fresh leaves in olive oil and freeze in sandwich bags to keep for winter use ..
4672 2018-11-02 21:10:42 Eons ago I used to go out of my way to get the best fries ever.  Then McD's decided to chance their oil to a more "healthy" one.  I no longer go "out of my way" to buy them.  Healthy sucks!
4673 2018-11-02 21:10:36 It’s pretty specific that exactly 1 million marine animals die from straws 
4674 2018-11-02 21:10:30 Yet, we are still subsidizing oil companies......

4677 2018-11-02 21:10:22 I think this was the main reason for the Iraq invasion in 2003. Saddam was considering changing to oil trading in euros (I think) instead of US dollars.
4678 2018-11-02 21:10:20 I feel deeply for those whose skins don't agree with coconut oil.  Y'all missing out.
4679 2018-11-02 21:10:09 If your biggest fear is "illegals" then you are a paranoid fool. The @GOP love of Saudi oil, for-profit-healthcare, busted unions, and poison air and water is killing this country but you and @realDonaldTrump are scare of poor brown people. #WakeUpAmerica
4680 2018-11-02 21:10:08 A trick I learned from @CulinaryMed on #Catalyst is that if you cook a bunch of vegies together in olive oil, you can mask the bitterness (and, to a large degree, individual taste) of vegies. 
Another favourite trick for making vegies more appealing: bake them!
4681 2018-11-02 21:10:06 This week I bought an essential oil diffuser for every room in my house and I’m just wondering what I did to end up here...

4688 2018-11-02 21:09:32 Woke up early to take my brothers to school, get an oil change, wash my car, drove to Whittier to pick up some clothes, got my nails done, and now picking up my brothers from school... very productive day so far I can say
4689 2018-11-02 21:09:26 That whole sequence was a clusterfuck.  The guy that you tied up that broke free.  Falling down the oil pit.  Nutty stuff.
4690 2018-11-02 21:09:23 Girl I saw one that said real eyebrows and oil change. LMAO had to make my own tweet. FED UP
4691 2018-11-02 21:09:22 I hate coming to firestone they got good service but they come over here talking about all this stuff that’s wrong. “Oh we got ya quoted here at 498.00” 

Sir. 

I’m not paying that, change my oil so I can shake.
4692 2018-11-02 21:09:21 getting my oil changed next week.
4693 2018-11-02 21:09:20 Deep frying is not a "quick and easy" cooking method. I don't know what your home is like, but we don't have scalding vats of oil laying around in case we get a hankering for vegetable fritters.
4694 2018-11-02 21:09:16 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
4695 2018-11-02 21:09:09 #Oil -7% for the week.

4697 2018-11-02 21:08:37 Most of the GFC stimulus was monetary policy of which the Fed was responsible. Obama provided liquidity to the banking sector which was positive at the time. Besides devaluation of oil, which was short term deflationary I can't remember any positive fiscal policy under BO

4700 2018-11-02 21:08:19 1. In a fungible global energy market, China does not “need” the US, nor does US necessarily “need” China. US oil and gas producers can mostly find willing buyers elsewhere, while China has no shortage of foreign oil and gas suppliers to choose from. @TulaneLaw #USChinaForum2018
4701 2018-11-02 21:08:15 So you don't need my original undiluted designer oil perfumes
4702 2018-11-02 21:08:13 Twitter made me get an oil change yesterday

4706 2018-11-02 21:07:37 Obama still pedaling his snake oil.
4707 2018-11-02 21:07:32 Once we start exporting oil from muzarabani the sanctions will be dropped
4708 2018-11-02 21:07:25 rent and car note paid, gas tank full, oil is changed, and shopping was successful 
4709 2018-11-02 21:07:23 Rent paid, car note paid, oil changed, two new tires. Yes I’m broke, yes I wanna go eat. 
4710 2018-11-02 21:07:19 Some guy in a powerful political position needs to bully some other one to secure money/land/oil, probably.
4711 2018-11-02 21:07:09 Re-starting FFXV after yonks, and first time noticing the Pyrefly spray-cans and Junon oil cans... #Unobservant
4712 2018-11-02 21:07:08 What next,when the oil runs out 
4713 2018-11-02 21:06:38 Surely this will help drive 
oil up, sensible or not. No?
Not so far in Northern Indiana.
$2.65 reg/87 oct today.
4714 2018-11-02 21:06:38 Yep! It’s the oil component of it. I like this idea better though cuz it doesn’t run! Nice. 
4715 2018-11-02 21:06:25 Hmmm which is more important? Money in the hands of oil company moguls thousands of miles away or pristine white beaches that attract tourists to all the local businesses and clean water for the fishing industries and local food chain?
4716 2018-11-02 21:06:07 ANSWER: YOU TRIED TO GET HILLARY ELECTED BY UNDERMINING TRUMP USING YOUR DEEP STATE OPERATIVES/SS-SECRET SOCIETY TO SPY, HELP PLANT RUSSIA LIE, AFTER HILLARY LOST YOU CALLED FOR RESISTANCE! YOUR PARTY OF NO IS CORRUPT WITH NOTHING FOR THE USA! YOU SIR ARE A SNAKE OIL CON MAN!!!
4717 2018-11-02 21:06:03 So what time did they have confirmation about this oil then?
4718 2018-11-02 21:06:02 I understand some car shit... but you guys are really out here paying extra for an oil change...
4719 2018-11-02 21:05:58 BOB sweats oil. That's pretty cool.
4720 2018-11-02 21:05:55 If you work in the oil patch, It must be a requirement to put it in your Twitter/insta bio lol
4721 2018-11-02 21:05:53 We need to stop buying shit with palm oil!
4722 2018-11-02 21:05:52 Reimposing the sanctions that were lifted by JCPOA is old news. What is new is that there is a realization that the world can not live without Iranian oil, that there is no spare capacity in KSA or anywhere else and that 8 countries (largest importers of Iranian oil) are exempted
4723 2018-11-02 21:05:49 Peppermint essential oil temples and back neck. Dilute with coconut oil if sensitive and don’t get it in your eyes

4727 2018-11-02 21:05:19 Peppermint oil sometimes helps, as does an ice pack
4728 2018-11-02 21:04:59 Iranian people are under economic pressure because the money Obama recklessly released, didn't end up in Iran, the money just supported Assad and Hizbullah and other terrorist groups in the region.  
As an Iranian I hope there will be no way to sell oil unless for food or drugs.

4732 2018-11-02 21:04:15 He’s the best troll. They can’t get him out of their heads!
4733 2018-11-02 21:04:09 right and why is US oil production at all-time highs? because we need energy independence. as in, because we need to say bye-bye to dictators and mob regimes who exist in power solely because of their oil reserves.
4734 2018-11-02 21:04:08 I think you're right. In a pinch for convenience, I'll order two McDonalds triple cheeseburgers and rip off the buns. I can tell whatever oil they cook it in isn't exactly ideal, but I'm not having any problems at all doing that occasionally.
4735 2018-11-02 21:04:08 Just found out Maruchan uses palm oil 
4736 2018-11-02 21:04:03 This deserves a @TwimbosAwards trophy.  I Keep checking the tweet. Just incase the oil has dried up 
4737 2018-11-02 21:03:57 I’m so pumped for tonight’s shift! We are doing a glitter oil show for the first time I’ll be online 7pm-3am PDT if your able to stop by I would love to see you!
4738 2018-11-02 21:03:48 GREAT. Iran's current regime is the source of instability in the Middle-East. Oil producers other than Iran are capable of replacing Iranian oil production. Why the give-away to some Anti-America Regimes? Obama helped worsen the M.E. situation by Pumping Cash into Iran.
4739 2018-11-02 21:03:37 I love the patriotism Americans have but they have a ton of nut-job lefties too.  I'd rather my Alberta left with Sasky and Manitoba and utilized Churchill for shipping oil and grain to the world markets.
4740 2018-11-02 21:03:35 Awesome statement. Now stop selling crap to them and buying their oil.
4741 2018-11-02 21:03:33 If our refineries are put into production, we can even sell pms, dpk, and ago @ any price we want it.The oil is ours we need not these $ rate you quoted. If we are selling to other nations, fine but if we are refining, no need just drill oil and refine period.Thats common sense.
4742 2018-11-02 21:03:30 No. No. San Diego is getting an oil change. That’s what he means.

4749 2018-11-02 21:02:59 Depression is like a sickness. When you're born with it, it's a neverending cold that takes its toll. The only ways to treat it is with Iron, Omega oil-3, a good amount of sleep, and a good amount of exercise. But when no one knows you have it, people assume you're just grumpy.
4750 2018-11-02 21:02:47 Lol I’d say far left is a worse look just saying man. Also oil support is what we need. I’m not looking to pay taxes for a bunch of people who are forcing their way into my state either.
4751 2018-11-02 21:02:41 hi @justsalad! out of curiosity, how is the chicken in your salads prepared? i know it's grilled, but do you use a particular type of oil? thank you so much for your reply in advance!
4752 2018-11-02 21:02:38 Oil is going sub 60 on WTI could go below 50 as well in intermediate. Specs are cutting positions

4754 2018-11-02 21:02:29 Good for them!!! The lowest, meanest thing I've ever heard, along with the plight of Native Americans in North Dakota. They need @SenatorHeitkamp, not a GOP kook who doesn't care! Trump salivating over Native American lands, the minerals & the oil. KANSAS< STAY TOUGH!!!
4755 2018-11-02 21:02:24 My dad did the same thing. He said it heats the oil up lol.
4756 2018-11-02 21:02:12 Ref wanted to see someone die that day I guess.
4757 2018-11-02 21:02:07  Use caution if you're headed over Stevens Pass this afternoon. Spilled oil from a leaking vehicle was reported on US 2 between mileposts 60 and 63. Maintenance crews are en route so #GiveEmABrake if you see them.
4758 2018-11-02 21:02:04 Yeah of its below 50 get that oil hot and moving before hits

4769 2018-11-02 21:00:48 Even though N90 may be a figure gotten non economically, you can get crude oil cheaper than the int’l price. We have Domestic supply obligations for gas-power, we can do the same for crude. Supply from NNPC share of onshore fields at just above production price.

4782 2018-11-02 20:59:57 Keystone was approved by Trump in March 207, Energy East was cancelled in September 2017. Reason's given by company were changes in the world oil economy.
4783 2018-11-02 20:59:47 is vegetable oil when you're
4784 2018-11-02 20:59:38 Exactly. They aren't even trying to hide it anymore. And I am pretty sure they know how the exchange rate, oil price and stock market fluctuations work, they just dont think that we have a clue..
4785 2018-11-02 20:59:27 6oil: So once again, THE BUBBLE may catch liberals, press & think-tanks by surprise. ‘But the polls r so good’ they will say, we will win! Did that not happen in 2016? The destructive news BUBBLE keeps out facts, e.g. weather reports not warning people, Fraud costing $, oil, etc
4786 2018-11-02 20:59:27 On behalf of USA, I apologize. I’m trying to get scientists and regular people to take seriously my idea to shut down an oil company or two. Then there would not be fossil fuel to burn for wasteful internet.
4787 2018-11-02 20:59:23 Come out for Ladies Night tonight! We have over $300 in prizes, wine, coffee and olive oil samples.
4788 2018-11-02 20:59:13 Social security is paid for by its own tax, it doesn’t add to the deficit. So when people talk about “cutting social security to reduce the deficit,” they are talking about stealing from Americans’ retirement to pay debts for wars, oil company subsidies and tax cuts for the rich.
4789 2018-11-02 20:59:04 If Nigerians could only understand the real implications of misgovernance.
The ideology a government shouldn’t really matter, if a country is governed right.   
Venezuela has the largest deposit of oil globally, but misrule has brought it to its knees.
#GoodGovernance matters!
4790 2018-11-02 20:58:59 I'm gonna guess it's because they have way less money to spend than the oil companies who are funding the "no" position.
4791 2018-11-02 20:58:48 Srsly though who do I know that can start changing my oil? I’m so tired of spending $100+
4792 2018-11-02 20:58:40 Finally bought the oil diffuser/humidifier I needed 
4793 2018-11-02 20:58:34 What’s another good oil cleaner than?
4794 2018-11-02 20:58:24 Coconut oil!!  
4795 2018-11-02 20:58:15 I've got one mission 'something oil - Part IV' in chapter 2, no sogn of parts 1-3, this has happened a few times.
4796 2018-11-02 20:58:15 After conceding 4 hmmm patience ran out. Those fading/faded giants will drill oil soon 
4797 2018-11-02 20:58:14 These two together deaden our compassion for the poor.  But it gets worse. Although Matthew 25 ENDS with Jesus welcoming those who feed the needy and casts out those who did not, the START of that chapter commends the 'wise' virgins who refuse to share their extra lamp oil with
4798 2018-11-02 20:57:45 Don’t worry. They have oil, and they hate the same ‘enemy du jour’, that Trump does- Iran Haven’t you heard?  In the Kingdom of Messiah, “Love covers a multitude of sins”. In this present “rule”, it’s money that covers a multitude of sin.

Led a team of women who showed that a vitamin in cod-liver oil or ultraviolet radiation could prevent rickets (to be confirmed as vitamin D) and later formed the Nutrition Society.
4801 2018-11-02 20:56:59 Correction... something like $1,600,000,000 is posted in deposit for future cleanups. 

So the big oil subsidy is only:

$258,400,000,000...
4802 2018-11-02 20:56:57 He doesn’t want to drill. He just wants wind mills powered by oil pressure. You never know, but he could have a connection for some little pigs for you?
4803 2018-11-02 20:56:56 There’s a feeling of triumph pulling into Valvoline right before 3 other cars and getting in right away for an oil change. So glad I don’t have to do this tomorrow now.
4804 2018-11-02 20:56:49 Just learned that the nickname of Dennis "Oil Can" Boyd (whom I didn't face as a batter very often at all) doesn't actually refer to beer but refers to moonshine. #LChaim
4805 2018-11-02 20:56:45 So I finally took ofada rice and ofada sauce today.
And it was just red oil and pepper with locos bean then a different kinda rice
4806 2018-11-02 20:56:43 No way, please don't take advice from Obama the snake oil salesman.
4807 2018-11-02 20:56:38 The eight countries are those that the U.S. is in ongoing negotiation with: Japan, South Korea, etc.  Giving them time to ease out of the Iran oil market rather than an abrupt cutoff is part of the negotiation leverage.
4808 2018-11-02 20:56:25 well I officially deserve to lose my privileges to the microwave at work. I microwaved a jar of coconut oil that stil had the tin foil seal on it and was seconds away from the whole thing catching on fire
4809 2018-11-02 20:56:25 Yeah, let's buy Saudi and ME oil, Climate Barbie @cathmckenna ! #stupid #TrudeauIsKillingOurEconomy #TrudeauMustGo
4810 2018-11-02 20:56:23 Big oil companies: "Burn the earth to the ground, vote no on 1631."

Yes, it'll reduce use of fossil fuels - that's the point.
Over time, it'll help us shift toward cleaner sources of energy. I support it.
4811 2018-11-02 20:56:15 I always thought the Romans were quite fond of olives..
At least, the oil of the olives.
4812 2018-11-02 20:56:10 My car keeps saying, “oil change” & I just keep pretending I don’t see it. 
4813 2018-11-02 20:56:07 Lmao I’m mad he knew exactly what he was doing with that oil change option 
4814 2018-11-02 20:56:06 Hear hear Deborah - another of the Leavers who believe it's about "fear" reminds me of the self-promoting campaigners for IndyRef - deluded in believing their numbers make sense; thank God Scotland voted NO when you see what happened to oil.
4815 2018-11-02 20:56:06 Means a lot! I just hope CBD oil is as awesome as people say it is. Does it help you out a lot?
4816 2018-11-02 20:55:53 @tbbinc3 Love all I’ve got from u guys. Would LOVE to try the “Ho, Ho, Ho!” oil, but really don’t wanna have to fork over the full $25, just to try it, just in case it’s not for me. All that to say, I sure do wish u guys would start offering samples of “Ho, Ho, Ho!”......
4817 2018-11-02 20:55:52 Currently getting an oil change. Also currently getting talked into 20 extra things needed done to my truck. 
4818 2018-11-02 20:55:52 Supposedly, many a Greek made it through WW2 by stewing the weeds with garlic and dressing them with lemon juice and olive oil.
4819 2018-11-02 20:55:47 change final drive oil, perhaps for one that can stand higher temperature. Saw that done several years ago and it loaded up the hubs. (Worked though!)
4820 2018-11-02 20:55:47 Thanks, Rishma. Well, why not vinegar... My dermatologist already has me using olive oil on my skin instead of lotion...all I need to add is lettuce & tomatoes & Voilá: I'm a salad!  I'll have to give it a try & see how it works, for sure. Natural is always healthier.
4821 2018-11-02 20:55:35 The lady who has a year to live needs to take cannabis oil for the cancer
4822 2018-11-02 20:55:32 This is what the whole world are turning blind eyes on, genocide committed by the military that supposed to protect.
Not surprised,. Nigeria oil money is what is making Britain keep quiet and turned the other way.
Same as what France is doing in Cameroon.
4823 2018-11-02 20:55:32 ~ FINALLY got around to going in for an oil change… and they’re out of oil.
4824 2018-11-02 20:55:25 All I use is organic coconut oil cuz of all the preservatives they b putting in lotions but I still b wondering is that even enough 
4825 2018-11-02 20:55:12 Assuming those 3 left out cause of oil money
4826 2018-11-02 20:55:00 Chevron reported Friday that its third-quarter profit doubled from a year earlier as production increases met rising oil prices. The San Ramon company also said it restarted share buybacks in the third quarter.
4827 2018-11-02 20:54:58 Perhaps we need an UBER-like service for beard maintenance. Fire up an app and a hipster stops by with shears, combs and oil. For a small surcharge, he can pick up avocado toast on the way.
4828 2018-11-02 20:54:58 Satan's only temptation to the Messiah in the wilderness was by quoting to him scripture. Without the oil and wine of the glory you're a child of the religious devil.
4829 2018-11-02 20:54:56 How can they determine danger when there is no oil that has been discovered yet?
4830 2018-11-02 20:54:56 Oil mate
4831 2018-11-02 20:54:54 Truth is I couldn’t wait an already ordered my oil and balm. My wife balked at my wanting to order one of the kits with a brush. All in due time I guess!
4832 2018-11-02 20:54:53 If you have oily skin, you can’t really add the excess oil on top of it. I break out every time no matter what.  Cleansers, foundations, concealers, creams. Even with Retinoids. I like an oil free foundation that dries down like ink. I have my bb tarte on the way 
4833 2018-11-02 20:54:39 Historic own goal for trump sure sanction will hurt ordinary Iranians but China will continue to buy Iran’s oil it will continue to invest at the detriment of Eu country’s who trump knows he can bully . China wins America loses its that simple and the price of oil who fills void
4834 2018-11-02 20:54:35 Quel exploit ça fait 16€ par mois quand on connaît les augmentations du fuel du gaz de l' essence du cas oil le pouvoir d achat est de plus en plus négatif
Décidément EM vous êtres très fort pour brasser du vent ou pour réinventer l eau chaude mais vous êtes nullissimes en maths
4835 2018-11-02 20:54:27 Going without an oil change can really fuck your car up yo lmao y’all geeking
4836 2018-11-02 20:54:13 One sesame seed won't make oil. ~ Burmese Proverb [Myanmar]
4837 2018-11-02 20:54:12 Have great weekend  want know  more dm me about an oil #doterraessentialoils
4838 2018-11-02 20:54:05 In 2q17 PXD had for instance more capex of 1.2 bn and production growth of 30 k bpd, in 2q18 capex was 1.7 bn and production growth just 10k bpd - a fourfold decrease of productivity. Higher oil prices and higher gas production mask this huge change. Shareholders are waking up.
4839 2018-11-02 20:54:05 It probably was to get milk down us - I bought some semolina recently and made myself some  - if you got a cold you got camphorated oil rubbed on your chest and some horrible pink lint laid on it  - I seem to remember.
4840 2018-11-02 20:54:00 Little to do with it. US oil production is at all-time highs
4841 2018-11-02 20:53:59 Whether Zimbabwe discover oil, gas, diamonds, cobalt or whatever its same fanana cos the citizens don't benefit anything.. Only the greedy and selfish politicians will benefit so hameno ikoko
4842 2018-11-02 20:53:55 I asked my neighbor what’s this little genie bottle looking thing on my dash .. he pops the hood and says wow Karima you have no oil  wtf
4843 2018-11-02 20:53:37 This is hydrogen plus diesel or fuel oil?
4844 2018-11-02 20:53:31 Well.., the worlds top “X-Men” doesn’t let you export anything with high value & international high &  frequent demand which they don’t benefit on it.., they will ban to accept it..as of what they did on Chat.. Drug- silent monopoly, Oil- open monopoly..
4845 2018-11-02 20:53:30 Speaking of money...

$260,000,000,000... 

Is the latest subsidy to big oil...

At least AER apologized to @OilGasCanada on your behalf...

4849 2018-11-02 20:52:37 not surprised...Warren Buffett is the greediest billionaire in the history of billionaires...he abuses the tax system like no one else...fought the Keystone pipeline so his trains were the only way to transport oil #POS

4852 2018-11-02 20:52:01 @ProfJNMoyo  hopefully #Masiyiwa will understand much better the team he is backing after watching that #oil/ gas video
4853 2018-11-02 20:51:49 Khashoggi's story is an international conspiracy planned to be a way for them to attack the Saudi Arabia .There is an international financial crisis coming, America and the European Union wants to take from Saudi Arabia oil for free after falling according to their plan
4854 2018-11-02 20:51:38 @TopDogTipsMag you need to take your extremely high carb diabetic dog food recipes (containing white rice, corn oil, and WHITE PASTA!!!, etc.) off YouTube!  These recipes are harmful for diabetic dogs! Non-diabetic people shouldn't even eat white rice and pasta! Get educated!
4855 2018-11-02 20:51:28 Don't let your hair get into your face while you sleep. The oil from your hair can cause acne.

4858 2018-11-02 20:51:01 But...what if I want to buy a tanker of oil and a fighter jet? I can only see those commercials...well on any "news" channel.

But that's only a coincidence as to why they incessantly promoting war...right?
4859 2018-11-02 20:50:57 Yo saudi arabia just sawed a journalist to death over politics, why aren't you on them about that? Oh right cause they sell oil and buy weapons.
4860 2018-11-02 20:50:53 Trump got a lot of $ from the Saudis. He ignores their gruesome murder of a journalist for an American newspaper. Then he sanctions the Saudis' enemy to drive up their oil profits at the expense of Iran. This isn't leadership, Trump's doing what was assigned to him by the Saudis.
4861 2018-11-02 20:50:36 China will carry on purchasing Iranian oil and all the sanctions will be a historic own goal for trump and very advantageous for China filling the void

4870 2018-11-02 20:49:31 They want 2000 for breaks and an oil change  that’s going put a fucking dent in my account.
4871 2018-11-02 20:49:26 I'm all for articles from the archive, but wasn't the oil drop analogy disproved fairly recently?

4876 2018-11-02 20:48:50 I looked at the oil & gas sector’s contribution to the overall (BEA) after tax profits number a while back. It seemed to explain quite a large part. Story could’ve changed by now, I grant you.
4877 2018-11-02 20:48:49 OIL OIL OIL . と紙に書くとサザエさんに聞こえる。
4878 2018-11-02 20:48:44 And that was just their liver oil mate. Straight though you, no messing... not even touching the sides.
4879 2018-11-02 20:48:37 The only thing planned between Trump and XI is dinner at the G20...no trade deal...oh, Trump has lied again. He wanted the stock market to go back up before midterms....that's all.  He's also keeping gas prices low with Saudi paying him back by pumping more oil before midterms.
4880 2018-11-02 20:48:29 Yeah, I tried getting a Nuru at a massage parlor in Germany but they didn't have the actual NURU so it was just a LOT of oil... not that I complained at that moment and she definitely made it a memorable experience, much more than a happy ending...

4884 2018-11-02 20:47:48 I’m not yo lmaooo not having an oil change can really fuck your car up but bet 
4885 2018-11-02 20:47:41 Renewables are the cleanest way forward, not Big Oil, Medium Oil or even Small Oil.
4886 2018-11-02 20:47:41 Rich - Cream
Middle class - Vaseline 
Poor - Pomade 
Cultist - red oil
4887 2018-11-02 20:47:25 Driving a couple of miles after changing your oil also lets the new oil go through your oil lines and engine. Your old oil won't all be drained out because of pooling and the small amount of oil in your oil lines, but that shouldn't be a problem.
4888 2018-11-02 20:47:23 That's because Saudis own corporate America. Saudis sell us oil, America sells Saudis weapons, 911 and butchering a journalist is Saudis way of showing us who is in charge. Saudi Arabia and the USA are partners in crime

4909 2018-11-02 20:44:49 Oil has such cool names - Brent Crude, West Texas Intermediate, Bonny Light....
4910 2018-11-02 20:44:38 We are still in a macro uptrend. Oil crushed and aapl down 8% yet ES is only down .5%.... and everyone is still so bearish... has the last 10 years of getting rocked selling this market taught anyone anything?
4911 2018-11-02 20:44:31 I was getting it from a BC company but they got shut down like u were saying. Stuff I found locally wasn't very effective for me. Like said it took a while to find a quality one an now their waiting to get licence apperently. They sold everything from buds to cbd oil.
4912 2018-11-02 20:44:28 The U.S. has agreed to let eight countries -including Japan, India and South Korea -keep buying Iranian oil after it reimposes sanctions on the OPEC producer on Nov. 5, a senior administration official said.
@business
4913 2018-11-02 20:44:27 The conservatives in Ottawa and Edmonton had 40 years to make sure we could get oil to international markets. And no plan to reduce Climate Change.  And orphan Wells?  The plan seems to be to socialize costs after subsidizing oil companies while they made obscene profits.
4914 2018-11-02 20:44:26 I’m finna learn how to change out my own damn oil & do my own damn brakes! Just watch 
4915 2018-11-02 20:44:26 I forget. Hurricanes are relatively new. Only been in exsistence since the time of the oil industry.

4918 2018-11-02 20:44:05 Wasn't $30 oil part of the reason adduced for Nigeria's recent recession? Even if you back out cost oil... Adjusting for JV/financing costs and PSC cost recovery, I believe the reason for paucity of export earnings is self evident?
4919 2018-11-02 20:44:02 Wish the PCs were as critical thinking as yourself when they were running deficits during the oil boom.
4920 2018-11-02 20:44:01 This man just gave me a run down a problems wrong with my car but at least I got my oil changed

4923 2018-11-02 20:43:52 The oil & gas extraction industry currently has capacity utilization of near 100% or more (sometimes over 100%), so I doubt it.

4926 2018-11-02 20:43:26 He won’t listen to this advice - he’s hung up on ideology. Oil companies will laugh into their Scotch’s at extra room at the pump for an extra mark up that as you rightly suggest they will slowly suck back *our* savings. Recall his winter gas scam price credit he tried to take?

Hands off Heid . Pick on me ya bullies.
4933 2018-11-02 20:42:57 shower in warm water and not long showers, add as much water based products as you can and seal it with a butter. Layer all your products from water based to oil based to keep your skin as protected as you can. Might have to do it more than once a day.
4934 2018-11-02 20:42:54 So you want him to walk bear foot ? He is not killing anyone in the process . We using oil are killing people because our thirst for oil is at the root of all atrocities we are witnessing  today . His carbon print is probably the best of all CEO

4938 2018-11-02 20:42:15 Trump was trying to get the stock market numbers UP before the midterms...like he is also doing with oil prices...gas at the pump.  He has the Saudi's pumping everything they can to keep prices low before midterms...is that the payoff for over looking the murder?

4947 2018-11-02 20:41:18 no that's not what saudi is for, it's for control of japans and europes oil supply and some petro dollar recycling with buying stuff to keep mil industrial affloat, iran could be that one day, and it would be preferable if theocracy was ditched, shia isis is what iran has now.

4950 2018-11-02 20:41:07 You like Syria ? It’s all because of oil . U feel good that your cheap gas is paid with human life?
4951 2018-11-02 20:40:58 If you include oil subsidies they come to roughly $10k/car sold per year..
4952 2018-11-02 20:40:42 Are u sure its all about oil and gas exploration? The digging and drilling for possible commercial production in 20chakuti? And no diamonds involved?

4955 2018-11-02 20:40:15 Funny I hear about "gas" prices dropping like a stone due to "over production".....

No mention of PRESIDENT TRUMP pushing Saudi Arabia to produce more oil 2 months ago....

That's the next thing that loser Obama will be trying to take credit for along with the economy. #loser
4956 2018-11-02 20:40:13 Yep, both of those are true. When your engine is warm before changing your oil, there is a better chance that all of the oil in your oil pan drains out. You should drive a couple of miles after changing the oil to ensure that oil isn't leaking from the bottom of your car.
4957 2018-11-02 20:40:08 迷うなあサラダ油なの？ごま油なの？どっちが好きなの？
4958 2018-11-02 20:40:01 depends on how thick the oil is y como lo uses. antes no me duraba un carajo. llevo casi 2 semanas con un gramito y no ha llegado a la mitad

2litres is going for US$2.50 or $9Bond then sugar is going for $4.
4961 2018-11-02 20:39:20 Ooh! Maybe we should punish them both and spur more domestic industry by weaning ourselves off (foreign) oil. No?

4965 2018-11-02 20:38:48 Some items for November oil markets - Iran sanctions impact on supply & inventories, global E&P underinvestment, merger mania in U.S., emerging markets (and US$ strength) and pace of China trade talks. Neat stat - net U.S. petroleum imports at 1.2 mmb/d vs. 6.3 mmb/d 2 yrs ago.
4966 2018-11-02 20:38:39 Plus u cannot get concentrated THC oil which I find works pretty good for sleep. Can't use it during the day but it sure knocks the pain down.. I can't smoke it due to desiese I have so I got a double whammy.
4967 2018-11-02 20:38:37 The other oil I bought is frankincense. That oil is the most usable of all the oils for me, although I have not tried cooking with it. The flavor might be a little strong for that
4968 2018-11-02 20:38:37 New tires, new rims, oil change, whoooooooo disssssss

I'm not keen on oil and/or vinegar in salads - olive oil if it has to be, but otherwise I'd rather be without :)
5053 2018-11-02 20:31:40 Wallahi
5054 2018-11-02 20:31:37 I literally just wanted one day to go home & take a nice nap, but NO ! I need a new tire & an oil change that’s gonna take all day long

5056 2018-11-02 20:31:24 Born this way is full coverage and I believe there’s coconut oil in it as well so you keeps your skin hydrated! I love it
5057 2018-11-02 20:31:23 Show me, from legitimate sources, another time in the last 50 years the economy grew 4.1% in Alberta with oil under $50 (it’s still sitting around $30 from Alberta Bitumen) - I’m happy to wait while you look.
5058 2018-11-02 20:31:22 Dear @AbelandCole, I’m a big fan of what you do, but asking me to massage oil into a bag of kale for 5 minutes is either a typo, or a niche joke from one of your writers. Grateful if you can clarify before I get stuck in.
5059 2018-11-02 20:31:14 Now, as I watch the sunrise.
Ah, the smell of oil, the morning light.
There's but one shadow cast on the asphalt.
5060 2018-11-02 20:31:12 my tank is on empty, my oil life is down to 10% l, I haven’t washed my car in 3 months, and there’s a crack in my windshield...my car is becoming me
5061 2018-11-02 20:31:11 Oh that’d be way smoother than a lumpy old oil burner, should go fairly well too 
5062 2018-11-02 20:31:03 You are the one making the inaccurate claims. 
The burden is on YOU to prove out your evidence to support your claim. 

I do not support your claim of 197 nation "disproven" at the hands of a plucky band of tobacco/vaping/oil lobbyists internet bloggers. ;)
5063 2018-11-02 20:30:53 I have them too from years of hitting the wrong friggin nail
5064 2018-11-02 20:30:44 Straight up. Evnthat oil and gas if we entertain it for a while, do we even have the proper governance systems in place to manage an oil find? Hanzi we will begin drilling next year. A company that is working out of a house in Aus? Our govt is a joke.
5065 2018-11-02 20:30:41 No...simply roasted.. with olive oil ail and parsley...
5066 2018-11-02 20:30:39 They look beautiful mine are very little but are a little thick not too long. I think castor oil is good for growth but I've never tried too impatient lol
5067 2018-11-02 20:30:38 Is that oil that goes in beards? Or the oil my beard produces? Many (the FDA) want to know?!
5068 2018-11-02 20:30:26 Honcho is due for a oil change tomorrow
5069 2018-11-02 20:30:17 Being dynoed is no big deal, but brace yourself for when they check your oil.
5070 2018-11-02 20:30:14 Like a Virgin Olive Oil #CookUpSomeMusic
5071 2018-11-02 20:30:07 he’s been selling that snake oil the last 30 years to any swinging dick that’ll listen
5072 2018-11-02 20:30:06 Yeah it isn’t happening lol. I was like let’s stick with the oil change and the two I asked to be replaced
5073 2018-11-02 20:30:06 Bout to start changing my own damn oil shit krazy
5074 2018-11-02 20:29:59 Lol defending the border is bad but engaging in illegal wars for oil is cool?
5075 2018-11-02 20:29:56 Sometimes I think the only person I should follow is Donald Trump.I mean he is a news in himself.He can create and destroy economies.His one tweet broked the back of crude oil, Volatility rose to its peak
5076 2018-11-02 20:29:56 castor oil 
5077 2018-11-02 20:29:54 allicin is the “smell and oil” when you crush the garlic. Our garlic powder contains less than 0.2% allicin which is very safe to be used.
Hope this helps.
5078 2018-11-02 20:29:50 soon as my mama get off , i’m going straight to publix’s for this oil 
5079 2018-11-02 20:29:48 Absurd
5080 2018-11-02 20:29:38 That’s that source! Lol did you also read that it’s better to have a warm engine prior to changing the oil? Then driving a couple of good miles after changing the oil?
5081 2018-11-02 20:29:33 FIFA wanted to weed out corruption so they removed Blatter and made Infantino the president only for him to get caught accepting more of that oil money
Beautiful game indeed 
5082 2018-11-02 20:29:09 Awh of course! My favorite are the crystal infused essential oil rollers. The stress relief one “Reclaiming My Chill” is my current favorite. I also love the zodiac line! 
5083 2018-11-02 20:28:59 Just ordered some CBD oil for Dola. I was already interested in trying it due to her anxiety, but her recent seizure convinced me to pull the trigger. Excited to see how she does with it.

5085 2018-11-02 20:28:42 Oh it's Mr. Clean source again. Care to enlighten us of your clean source of oil yet? Or just spouting deflective mumbo jumbo that sounds good but means nothing in reality?
5086 2018-11-02 20:28:38 Or just get rid of the federal oil tax
5087 2018-11-02 20:28:24 We COULD but the Saudis buy fucktons of our weapons that they don't need. They have deserts full of the unused stuff. 

Oh and we buy their oil. We could buy Iranian oil, shocker. or Norwegian. Or use less oil.
5088 2018-11-02 20:28:19 FYI.. INFLATION? Rising interest rates is what causes inflation. The cost of doing business IE interest. Energy is usually the number one driver but the price per barrel on oil is dropping like a stone and that's not because of a bad economy. Everybody relax
5089 2018-11-02 20:28:16 Crude oil. At some point spot market price was $10. And then recently $30. Was anyone selling below production costs?
5090 2018-11-02 20:28:14 I would pay to see everyone behind this slowly oiled in oil
5091 2018-11-02 20:28:14 They hvnt found oil they are still exploring
5092 2018-11-02 20:28:10 i’ve been using the palmers oil since july and i love it?

5094 2018-11-02 20:27:58  na real anointing oil
5095 2018-11-02 20:27:56 They alongside PSG paid Infantino and his allies not to get a sanction for breaking FFP. Qatar won the bid to host 2022 cux Almin bought PSG and opened a sports channel (BeIN sports)all in France. Those oil cartels hv cheated football.
5096 2018-11-02 20:27:29 ...1. What evidence exists of CBD oil fighting what diseases?
2. I know nothing of this ban. Tell me why it was banned and provide evidence.
5097 2018-11-02 20:27:24 Who said you were no oil painting @JoshGray12?
5098 2018-11-02 20:27:17 Got my car back today after an engine rebuild and a £1300 bill.

It’s now sat on the drive with no oil in as it’s pissed it all out the bottom of the engine.

My luck has to turn soon

5107 2018-11-02 20:26:11 Pretty much spot on for oil at the moment. It's going up each week for last few weeks.
5108 2018-11-02 20:26:02 I ve got 2 very unsettled and unhappy hounds here!  They need their CBD oil!  Hurry up and get here!!! #HempHounds
5109 2018-11-02 20:26:00 That’s Rick Perry. Our energy secretary. He thought it was about oil and carbon fuel industries. It was about nuclear material security. His first speech he gave was all about oil. After getting the job it was week before he realized his responsibility.
5110 2018-11-02 20:25:58 The oil and gas industry is heavily subsidized but we pay much higher taxes at the pump on gas and diesel than our American neighbours...hope that answers your question!
5111 2018-11-02 20:25:52 I've heard "the nails go through the wrist, not the palm", but that's some next level shit.

(Have any of the backyard foundry guys made a steel-melting oil furnace just for trolling-the-truthers points yet?)
5112 2018-11-02 20:25:49 China is always willing to buy oil, this is a sanction without teeth.
5113 2018-11-02 20:25:48 I carry a lavender essential oil with me, smelling it whenever I start to feel anxious always helps to calm me down &some days if it’s worse than others I’ll put it on my temples and the tip of my nose so I smell it continuously :)
5114 2018-11-02 20:25:46 No, it didn't go through skin pores, you most likely didn't rinse and dry the dog up well after the bath and as dogs are wont to do, it licked its skin cos it was wet.

Please get red oil, it helps. Speaking from experience.

Cheers!
5115 2018-11-02 20:25:22 better look that up you are still using oil. plus you are paying a 50% to 200% premium on the price of the car. So you really save ZERO. LOL.  And it gets funnier if you are using coal power.
5116 2018-11-02 20:25:02 Remember. There’s no plan of how to ship or travel if we stop using oil just like there’s no plan for what to do with animals solely used for food and clothing if we all go vegetarian.
5117 2018-11-02 20:24:58 Not when u have these clubs turning into play things for oil barons. A club should only be allowed to spend income it generates otherwise how would other clubs compete???
5118 2018-11-02 20:24:55 Should read

5119 2018-11-02 20:24:53 this might sound dumb as fuck but it’s not gonna leave like oil stains on our clothes? awhile back she had a horrible flare up and we used some different oils to help calm her skin down and it totally oil stained her shirt could have been the coconut oil that we used too tho
5120 2018-11-02 20:24:50 Pretty much.  Personally I didn't care too much that they held a show there considering our governments still buy oil & sell weapons to the Saudi's.
5121 2018-11-02 20:24:48 Comprei bio oil e gostei porque não fica melequento
5122 2018-11-02 20:24:39 Halloween shenanigans left me rather fragile today. Nothing for it then, but to have slaggy Chinese for lunch with lashings of Chilli Oil and wonton soup. Hooray!
5123 2018-11-02 20:24:37 Why does Qatar fund 70% of BBC? a figure u can factcheck? is it to control news and distract from how these White European Plunderers gave that 1 tribe oil that should go to ALL of us native Middle-eastern people?

5135 2018-11-02 20:23:33 Here is a question: is oil wet?
5136 2018-11-02 20:23:30 Oklahoma is doing well. Sorry guys it’s the oil. Those are good stats for both compared rustbelt. Wow. Oil petroleum engineering etc
5137 2018-11-02 20:23:21 You aren't lying.  Crocs and alligators make me question why anyone in the South or overseas enters the water at all.
5138 2018-11-02 20:23:13 ?
How is healing by natural herbs and supplements not science?

The reason pharma does NOT acknowledge natural healing is because they can NOT PATENT IT! 

No money to be made on nature!

Example: 
1-CBD oil effective in fighting many diseases.
2-Vitamin B17 banned in USA.
Why?
5139 2018-11-02 20:23:09 Do tell? So left wing hippies are the ones forcing police to fill US prisons with poor people? And Dems are the ones giving tax breaks to the 1% and protecting Saudi oil while poisoning the war in #Flint? You believe #KochBrothers lies. Don't be a fool.

5143 2018-11-02 20:22:21 Oil pressure warning short of a hat-trick
5144 2018-11-02 20:22:16 You should dilute tea tree oil with another oil for better/more even application. Castor oil, almond oil, or rose hip oil would work
5145 2018-11-02 20:22:01 Tell me again how you don’t have vested interests with Saudi Arabia????
“.... The US has increased its own production to fill in the gap left by Iran's oil and urged others to as well, especially Saudi Arabia....”
@realDonaldTrump
5146 2018-11-02 20:21:58 And a cycle of grievances---economic and political---which serves US (oil companies) interests reasonably well, or so is the thinking.
5147 2018-11-02 20:21:51 Please do find red oil and give your dog enough of it to drink. Your dog should be vomiting now and very weak. Red oil helps to helps to reduce the effect of most poisons.

Happened to my dog once and copious amount of red oil forced down her throat saved the day.

Act fast.
5148 2018-11-02 20:21:45 We sit back and let Russia attack our democracy and I was elections, it's time to attack them cut off their Oil, put Santion on country that buy their oil.
5149 2018-11-02 20:21:43 The President, (R) or (D), has very little to do with gas prices, good or bad. Trump is trying to make the U.S. less reliant on foreign oil, but OPEC still has a significant impact on oil price

5156 2018-11-02 20:20:23 Olive oil too can do it
5157 2018-11-02 20:20:22 they rolled it out and its a mess...can't buy Canadian CBD oil on line now. The government's shut down companies who supply medical/therapeutic grade oil (non psychoactive) they are selling the product at half potency in small bottles. A tax and investment grab for govt/buddies.
5158 2018-11-02 20:20:21 Don’t forget the offshore industry as well. Oil and transportation. We also need a boost.

5167 2018-11-02 20:19:33 I'd put the chances of a formal cut at their meeting at just about 0%. Too much ire it would draw from certain unstable politicians.

An informal cut, where they stop dumping inventory and damaging wells pumping flat out, without saying anything?  Looks a lot more likely to me.
5168 2018-11-02 20:19:29 Ooh, I know this one! Because the oil industry funds campaigns to contradict overwhelming scientific consensus based on evidence

5179 2018-11-02 20:18:26 It's already happened, no? Will they face extra fines? If you've got money, you've got everything. The United States will lick KSA's ass despite them being the main culprits of 9/11, so this FFP is nothing in front of oil money.
5180 2018-11-02 20:18:13 1 mile = 5280 feet

1 cubic mile = 5280*5280*5280 = 147 billion cubic feet

1 oil barrel = 5.615 cubic feet

147,197,952,000/5.615 = 26.2 billion barrels

Approximately 1/8 of all the bitumen recoverable from the oilsands using existing technology.

It can be burned once.

5189 2018-11-02 20:17:39 I noticed exactly the same thing dealing w/ the car dealer for oil changes. I'm running a current car much longer than I normally would, and I noticed that right after I came in with an aftermarket muffler/tailpipe, they stopped pitching me unnecessary services.
5190 2018-11-02 20:17:36 That's exactly right, Ed! 
(I REALLY wish the DEQ has specified which oil blend it was).
5191 2018-11-02 20:17:26 I use #cbd oil for my depression and anxiety! There is no better remedy out there! 
5192 2018-11-02 20:17:25 just read the sentence “From my experience as a certified extra virgin olive oil taster,” in the Olive Oil Times and now know what it would feel like to stumble into #coffeetwitter
5193 2018-11-02 20:17:25 It is time for an oil change? Just drive on in and we'll take care of you!
5194 2018-11-02 20:17:11 But you are giving oil waivers. TRUMP IS PUSSYWHIPPED!!!!
5195 2018-11-02 20:17:10 Absolutely  Be ready to spill some oil sweat during those hot arena matches today 
5196 2018-11-02 20:17:05 Please try and five the dog lots of water and force down red oil down his/her throat ...a sizeable amount of it please ...afterwards just help the dog to clean up because he wont be able to work n have no control over bowel moment
5197 2018-11-02 20:16:53 New essential oil and gemstone bracelet $15.00
5198 2018-11-02 20:16:52 Sanctions are suppose yoghurt the nation they are applied too. By allowing russian, china and the U.S. to continue to buy Iranian oil benefits Iran greatly. By stating European nations can not buy Iranian oil seems like you are trying to pay them back like a kid who got shamed
5199 2018-11-02 20:16:46 Fats and oil
5200 2018-11-02 20:16:39 Palm oil it
5201 2018-11-02 20:16:37 Better yet "Football and Oil" in fact "Footboil" caz the game stinks
5202 2018-11-02 20:16:29 I have been working in the oil and gas industry since 1972 and I have a lot of experience in these operations
5203 2018-11-02 20:16:13 Mostly oil/shale though, no?
5204 2018-11-02 20:16:12 By refusing to buy products with palm oil you can stop supporting deforestation of rainforests. Little things add up.
5205 2018-11-02 20:16:06 It’s almost disturbingly honest. 

“Our values, defined as oil and weapons trading, are aligned”
5206 2018-11-02 20:15:59 Actually - Trump is decreasing oil prices by supporting Saudi Arabia & drilling in the USa
5207 2018-11-02 20:15:56 And not a moment spent idle  - you really are the oil for our engine! #hidden heroes @GyldaNunn @SteveDunnCEO
5208 2018-11-02 20:15:54 I hope its a rugged breed,that can withstand a little stress..give palm oil
5209 2018-11-02 20:15:51 I suffer from RSD  and other complex pain conditions. I am tired of the meds not working. It was suggested I try CBD oil, it's over-whelming, the info, the choices. I really need it and hope to win. Thank you.
5210 2018-11-02 20:15:51 The following c/os did explorations without success: NUEVO 1998, Dana 1999, Hunt oil 1999, Fusion oil and gas from Australia in 1999, Santa Fe, 2000. Many were reluctant to attempt: Ennex Energy,Texaco, Oxy, Shell, Hess, Addax Petroleum of Switzerland and the Chinese oil company
5211 2018-11-02 20:15:41 The pocket watch in this video is Fried in oil. What does that mean？？#LayZhangNAMANANA #NAMANANA #AskLayNAMANANA
5212 2018-11-02 20:15:36 @cooper_m  how come there was uproar about the broadband ..... and barely a word about the give away of our natural resources such as oil and gas ??  Would be great to hear you tackle this , great show ...always listening in london 
5213 2018-11-02 20:15:26 Castor oil

5215 2018-11-02 20:15:10 Coconut oil !!
5216 2018-11-02 20:14:55 Says the person that just waived sanctions that stop the importation of Iranian oil.  I mean, you talk so much about stuff, then do the opposite.  How do your supporters know what to chant on any given day?
5217 2018-11-02 20:14:52 Wait so there’s not any benefits from lemon essential oil?
5218 2018-11-02 20:14:39 Hi  I’m doing a meet & greet in the buffalo airport rn! Come say hi :) I’m at gate 8 wearing a Canadian tuxedo and a turtleneck w/ olive oil stains on it. Please have pens ready for sigs! Or else I won’t have enough time to spend with all of u xo
5219 2018-11-02 20:14:30 Lmaooo the oil change on point 
5220 2018-11-02 20:14:23 WTI Crude Oil -0.9% to 63.20 bbl $USO
Gold -0.4% to 1233.40 oz $GLD
Copper +3.0% at $2.80 lb $CU
5221 2018-11-02 20:14:08 I need to go get a oil change.
5222 2018-11-02 20:14:07 We need to be organised in Zimbabwe, we can't discover oil deposits and the cure for HIV in the same week. One at a time please
5223 2018-11-02 20:13:58 I fucked up today. I put an oil filter on and didn’t realize the gasket had fallen off.  Spit 8 out 12 qts of diesel oil all over the shop. #yayme
5224 2018-11-02 20:13:51 Liberals and logic. Oil and water.
5225 2018-11-02 20:13:36 Saudi Arabia pays money for weapons, as America pays us for oil. We will not pay anything for our security, as Mohammed bin Salman said
5226 2018-11-02 20:13:24 America has always turned a blind eye to the two-faced Saudis. It's always been about Oil and Money. Scratch my back and I will ignore what you do.
5227 2018-11-02 20:13:09 Today I heard Bad Boys 3 is official. Now I'm watching Triple H & Shawn Michaels face Undertaker & (Mayor) Kane on #WWECrownJewel. 

The sale of CBD oil must be on the rise with all the creaking of the joints happening. 

I guess being over 50 has its benefits besides AARP…
5228 2018-11-02 20:13:00 Hope you have given it karnel oil?
5229 2018-11-02 20:12:58 A large proportion of our cheap petrol is smuggled. Either fix the borders or jack up prices to international standards. I doubt our cost of production is $10. That's shale oil standard. We import refined petrol not crude. So it's more costly.
5230 2018-11-02 20:12:58 if by that you mean "will there be proper intelligent conversation about the state of audio, not just a bunch of pitches from snake oil salesmen and a ton of spin and can I sit at the front" - then yes, my dear :-)
5231 2018-11-02 20:12:40 Teachers who want to teach facts will skip over those sections that deny the science of over 99% of relevant scientists (especially when you exclude the “scientists” working for the oil companies and other prodigious polluters.
5232 2018-11-02 20:12:38 Margaret Simpson was doing the oil business even when she was a star athlete   - @eastsportsman #SportsPanorama
5233 2018-11-02 20:12:33 Legit fuck Gullo Toyota. Small shop I went to couldn't get the oil canister off because the dealership compressed it on too tight so I have to go there if I want the oil changed. The dealership also had gone up by $30 recently for the price. Legit fuck this greedy ass dealership
5234 2018-11-02 20:12:23 $60 oil change??? I’m getting a bike
5235 2018-11-02 20:12:21 Soros funded the Sierra club. They oppose fossil fuel use in the United States. At the same time he funds drilling for oil off the coast of Brazil. It's fun to believe that he just wants the destruction of America. The other explanation is that he's just self-interested
5236 2018-11-02 20:12:14 Crude #oil falls again. Now down 18% from its high!
5237 2018-11-02 20:12:11 Is trump gonna figure out the Iran oil connection?
5238 2018-11-02 20:12:04 Invictus is being cautious becoz this is an expensive exercise & it may drill many wells before it makes commercial discoveries. Ghana knew it had oil in 1898 but only Kosmos succeeded in 2004.
5239 2018-11-02 20:12:04 try steaming ! get a bowl of hot water pour it over a washcloth put in on ur face (or put ur fave over the bowl and a towel over ur head) then apply the oil
5240 2018-11-02 20:12:03 Also Teatree oil is a safer alternative as well
5241 2018-11-02 20:11:59 Jep, eine Enterprise. Das ist "Oil Imperium" von reLine
5242 2018-11-02 20:11:55 They pollute our Earth was the oil the refineries car manufacturers that pollute poison the Earth and the final finished product continues pulling in the Earth for up to a hundred years
5243 2018-11-02 20:11:53 Been waiting for over an hour for an oil change when no one else was there when I arrived WTF do you think I want to waste my beautiful afternoon waiting on y’all to stop BS’n and get my car done 
5244 2018-11-02 20:11:41 did everyone notice that bob sweat oil when ashe and mccree were havin their little stand off?? if its canon that omnics can "sweat" oil i will scream that is so funny
5245 2018-11-02 20:11:40 I mainly used to just rub olive oil on my skin and then I just stopped 
5246 2018-11-02 20:11:39 Trumps taken a million barrels a day out of market by tearing up the Iran deal. That’s why gas and oil prices are high. His trade wars tax American consumers. He’s an ecominc wrecking ball.
5247 2018-11-02 20:11:38 It’s a shame I have to pay out the ass for a bottle of CBD oil to help my mental and physical health because it’s illegal in my state. The one that works and won’t test positive on a drug test cause of my job.
5248 2018-11-02 20:11:33 Yes looking like a cold one. We keep swapping between fan and oil filled radiator, ones too hot and one isn’t up to the job.
5249 2018-11-02 20:11:32 Roasted a cauliflower for an hour with a bit of Olive Oil over the top. Covered it with a Butternut Squash and Sweet Potato Bhuna with a bit of sour cream on top. 
Very easy to make healthy and tasty.
5250 2018-11-02 20:11:25 I just picked up the up&up brand Super B blend, evening primrose oil, and coconut oil supplements. I ordered them online to pick up in the store and got a $5 gift card. If you spend $40 you get a $10 gift card.
5251 2018-11-02 20:11:13 Sinking Government?? Stinking sinking ring of corruption, anarchism and ideological bullying cruelty, so tired it can’t muster a policy, desperate to line up with RW child killers like Israel. The musac nonGovernment  of #notmydebt. Alan Jones’ babies of snake oil self interest.
5252 2018-11-02 20:11:10 Economics can be used to remove people from basic reality. If i see an empty factory, i see unemployed stressed factory workers . I know the gov can create money out of thin air. All thats needed to get the whole thing going is money like oil in a machine. Then i say do it.
5253 2018-11-02 20:10:55 Consider home-cooking; chicken/beef, green beans, sweet potato or other vegetables, little olive oil,  beef consomme plus Merrick (backcountry) 99 percent chicken high protein + grain free as a healthy  binder.

5256 2018-11-02 20:10:43 Had family living near that area. Heard enough of their experiences with the protesters. Oh, and for wanting clean water, they sure left a lot of trash which was worse for the environment than oil.
5257 2018-11-02 20:10:42 They don't have Oil, Grimes.

5259 2018-11-02 20:10:30 The Oil Price will increase over 70  next week after imposing  U.S. sanctions on Iran, Iranian Oil related industries and partners. The world market shock is going to happen. The price is artificially down.

5266 2018-11-02 20:10:12 If you or someone you know would benefit from CBD hemp oil products you need to take a peak into the world of CBD hemp oil.
5267 2018-11-02 20:10:06 As a psoriatic arthritis patient, CBD has been a godsend for me to help relieve the joint point. I typically vape/dab most of the CBD I use, but having some oil to throw in the mix would be amazing!
5268 2018-11-02 20:10:04 Nope. Don’t know who they sell to but they sure are making lots of money. They jumped outside the box. And btw, I was comparing illegal crude oil modular refineries of Nigeria to previously illegal hemp farms of USA.

5271 2018-11-02 20:09:39 When is Trump going to say something different I mean he can't go after Muslims now that that 911 was a conspiracy for the United States to kill their own people and make them a war for oil so now you got to take your frustrations out of Mexicans the farmers they feed you
5272 2018-11-02 20:09:38 Oil change, new battery, new windshield wipers... bitch my packets hurting 
5273 2018-11-02 20:09:35 nos comentários de where did i go da jorja smith e alguem falou assim looks like she woke up put coconut oil on her face, curled her lashes then said "lets make an underliningly aesthetic video" e sinceramente muito verídico

5281 2018-11-02 20:08:58 NBC You are not Creating Violence Trump is Creating Violence. He is a mastermind manipulator who can never do anything wrong. He's attacking the press because of Fox $Oil News! $$$$$
5282 2018-11-02 20:08:51 You realize Republicans are responsible for the vast majority of this?  It was Bush that started these wars over oil.  How convenient you forget what actually got us here.  Since Trump was elected the rate of civilian deaths has exploded.  Strange you completely ignore that.
5283 2018-11-02 20:08:35 Can anyone that’s used it first hand recommend a good brand/store to buy CBD oil from? Don’t want to end up with something that’s bad quality or not high enough strength.
5284 2018-11-02 20:08:31 I actually laugh when people try to brag about working in the oil field. Maybe a couple years ago when it was fucking booming & paychecks were $4k-6k every 2 weeks. Not now! That’s why my family got out of it.
5285 2018-11-02 20:08:26 Yeah... You are right but now oil is still the main source of revenue that's why governments always makesure we depends on the usage of oil...

5293 2018-11-02 20:07:17 China & Russia have gone to great lengths to aid NK - like meeting them in deep water to off load oil... they are collaborators. BTW - I have been rweading the history of Chinese economy since the revolution to present, if you think they will buckle - think again.

Zimbabwe Zimbabwe Zimbabwe.  
What have Zimbabweans done to deserve all this?
5297 2018-11-02 20:06:41 With that logic the Patriots, Celtics, Padres, braves, pirates, Blackhawks, senators, Hitmen, Warriors, winterhawks, oil kings, wheat kings, etc, etc, etc.... would be considered under the same assumption.
5298 2018-11-02 20:06:22 People will find a way of taking the crude oil out of the country to sell. This thing is simple but we like to bring up impossible scenarios. Same thing happened during the fixed FX regime

5301 2018-11-02 20:06:00 Venezuela has the world’s largest oil reserves, it should be like Norway or Kuwait or the gulf states.  Instead it’s shit.  Channel four should be calling the leaders to account.

5304 2018-11-02 20:05:55 The general body of Christ needs the spiritual alabaster oil as an ointment. A great separation from who we are, and who the world is.

We need to endure sound doctrine, and be bold enough to spiritually discern and confront all incomplete truths. - Adebowale #Day2 #Godspattern

5306 2018-11-02 20:05:51 We could use more opposition to banks. They're behind the Wall Street MIC. They hold the $$$ from defense contracts as well as the $$$ from the oil the incursions target. It's contradictory to oppose one and support the other

5318 2018-11-02 20:04:55 The smell of coconut oil is so soothing
5319 2018-11-02 20:04:48 Yeah well we know that's bullshit. For example, oil magnates. The money there comes from transportation, which supports the system by allowing goods to be shipped further and people to live further away from their jobs. Life would not be worse without transportation.
5320 2018-11-02 20:04:31 I’d think that as long you’re free of oil stains on your coveralls, you should be good to go!

5323 2018-11-02 20:04:13 sauté onion and gratuitous amounts of garlic in olive oil then add diced peppers (I use red+yellow+green bell & habanero+jalapeño). Season with salt, cumin, & cayenne, let peppers soften a bit then add chopped zucchini & more oil&cumin&cayenne. Simmer until zucchini is tender.
5324 2018-11-02 20:03:49 What a dumb ass, either he deliberately blocks out the truth and rejects reality! Or is literally deaf, dumb, and blind! No one mentions the tons of jobs berry ran off or banned! Forcing people into poverty, or into mooching! Oil and water do not mix buddy!
5325 2018-11-02 20:03:49 Didn't we go into Iraq for the Extraterrestrial technology the Cabal was looking for?   Don't think it had to do with oil or gas or anything like that.  Anybody know anything about this?

5328 2018-11-02 20:03:41 I use Trilogy Certified Organic Rosehip Oil and buy it from Ulta. It’s about $30.00 but there is definitely dupes! When I have a breakout I use it daily. My scaring is basically gone now and I use it out of comfort every other day. Lol In your case, I’d recommend using it daily!
5329 2018-11-02 20:03:38 "Business attire" on an invitation is confusing. What kind of Business Attire? US Bank business attire? North Loop tech business attire? 

I've met CEOs dressed like they are about to change oil in their lawnmowers,
5330 2018-11-02 20:03:36 well for my skin I usually use some clinique shit my mom got me (I'll get the name later) but for my hair Biosilk saves my life. Also I change oil every 3,000 miles! A new filter every 2 oil changes if not every single time.
5331 2018-11-02 20:03:32 Give the dog plenty of palm oil
5332 2018-11-02 20:03:29 So many things wrong here. First of all "honorable Obama "? Oh my no. Most divisive pres ever. Almost ruined our country. Thankfully Trump is saving it. Factories aren't closing they're opening. Look at steel business. Coal oil tariffs have helped.
5333 2018-11-02 20:03:23 Not to be an artist on main, but I love art so much, why is the greasy, buttery, grossly silken texture of oil paint so satisfyingly beautiful 
5334 2018-11-02 20:03:19 Too much palm oil in

5336 2018-11-02 20:03:06 Given no one seems to have any evidence one way or the other right now on what to expect, it's a bet on the roulette wheel - but the oversold technicals should trigger buying soon one way or the other.
5337 2018-11-02 20:02:50 Thanks Sam - I was looking to make a day trade on oil. Got 3:1 ($750) for a quick move up from the 10 min level on level you showed us this morning
5338 2018-11-02 20:02:50 Coconut oil works perfect xxxx
5339 2018-11-02 20:02:42 Anyone not completely beholden to oil companies knew the damage was more severe than reported.
5340 2018-11-02 20:02:38 There was this strange creaking sound following me around the house today, creeping me out. Then I realizat it was coming from my knee joints  The tin man needs some oil

5342 2018-11-02 20:02:32 The United States will allow eight countries to temporarily keep importing Iranian oil after sanctions are reimposed next week, when it will blacklist hundreds of companies and individuals, U.S. officials said Friday.
5343 2018-11-02 20:01:53 Fun fact: that’s an oil drilling platform disguised as an island.

Make Ukraine a member of EU & NATO
Drive oil prices way down
Ban #ruSSian #mob from EU & USA!
5348 2018-11-02 20:01:22 JUST THE FACTS: According to the U.S. Department of Energy, the Permian Basin, which stretches from West Texas to New Mexico, produces more crude oil than any of the OPEC countries, except Saudi Arabia and Iran.
5349 2018-11-02 20:01:20 Pumpkin seeds slow fried in olive oil with sea salt and garlic make an excellent snack and go well with a glass of red wine. Don’t waste any of your pumpkin 
5350 2018-11-02 20:01:17 I heard OPEC is pumping out more oil, thereby flooding the market. If true.

5353 2018-11-02 20:00:43 The little motor oil sweatdrop really sold me on him like omg they didnt have to do that but it was so perfect
5354 2018-11-02 20:00:41 Not to be too reductive, but it all goes back to Mossadegh having the audacity to nationalize his own country’s oil in 1952.
5355 2018-11-02 20:00:36 No chance anything happens to PSG and City, that oil money is too important. Fuck Football
5356 2018-11-02 20:00:33 wodksls a lot of people say oil free things are good but it’s so drying and just caused more acne !!!!
5357 2018-11-02 20:00:32 my current favorite chips are hummus crisps w rosemary and olive oil so i feel these might be up my alley.
5358 2018-11-02 20:00:29 #Zim Week in One 29/10 - 2/11:

 1.Cure for AIDS discovered by prophet, 

2.Discovery of oil 

3. Some sort of ice/snow in Murewa. 

ALL LATER DEBUNKED in the course of the week as FALSE. Not sure about 3.
5359 2018-11-02 20:00:23 My argument isn't whether tar sands are good or bad. Simply asked where this clean source of oil comes from. Some donut says "clean oil source!" and you all jumped on it like a bitch in heat. Meaningless words.
5360 2018-11-02 20:00:16 cant we just buy their oil instead of doing this every time ?
5361 2018-11-02 20:00:09 You are not saving Ontario residents anything as the oil companies will eat up any savings that are seen withing weeks. They answer to stock holders and stock holders look for profits. So your 5 cents a litre will evaporate within weeks. If not days
5362 2018-11-02 20:00:07 Greasy hair after only one day? Add some baby powder to your scalp to dry up some of the oil. Make sure to brush it through really well and it should get you and your hair through another day without damaging suds.
5363 2018-11-02 20:00:07 T’es bien le seul Bayonnais qui ne va jamais en Espagne  Bayonne/Dancharia .. 30 bornes .. !! 50 litres de gas oil a 1,25.. 62,50€.. au lieu de 75€ en France !! Sans oublier les courses, viande, alcool, tabac, fruits, légumes.. ça vaut le déplacement !!

5366 2018-11-02 19:59:42 The troubles we have in the world today are because we have stepped away from our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Society scratches its head to figure out why things are going wrong. To me it is like running no oil in an engine and wonder why it blew-up.
5367 2018-11-02 19:59:41 Aye it's got fuck all to do with the oil companies using the oil slump as an excuse to decimate terms and conditions. No wonder it's so easy to paint the Yes support as anti-union with your comments. Without unions we would have fuck all
5368 2018-11-02 19:59:34 If only Oil rich Venezuela was an upstanding democracy like … er.. Saudi Arabia #c4news
5369 2018-11-02 19:59:32 Pogba,martial, Sanchez are not MERCENARIES de bruyne, sterling,aguero,david silva are because they get oil money not fans money because they don't have any
5370 2018-11-02 19:59:31 I fucking love dirty oil money 
5371 2018-11-02 19:59:28 Yeah, cuz I'm the one making billions with oil production at record high levels and still laying people off?? 

And you responded to me so you can move right along now. Thanks
5372 2018-11-02 19:59:27 I disagree with you. While accepting that it doesn't make economic sense to sell the crude at a lower price, it doesn't make it impracticable. If all the Federating units agree to sell oil to refineries at an artificially low price so be it.
5373 2018-11-02 19:59:18 Shame :- US permitted India to purchase Oil from Iran
5374 2018-11-02 19:59:04 Blows my mind that people think APS is only working to keep your electric rates low.  Nothing could be further from the truth. Solar energy is the future of the world while APS is using dirty coal and dirty oil for power.  Give me a break APS stop lying to your customers! #solar

5377 2018-11-02 19:58:54 "An adequately supplied oil market" = "We're both trying to accelerate global climate change."
5378 2018-11-02 19:58:53 That he was 21 again and doesn’t have the agility of an oil tanker. Total lack of composure from someone with his experience thinking he could ever win that ball. #bwfc
5379 2018-11-02 19:58:48 Commodities: #Lumber +3.74%, #Copper +2.68%
Top commodity gainers are Lumber (3.74%), Copper (2.68%) and Natural gas (1.92%). Biggest losers are Bitumen (-2.24%), Steel (-1.31%) and Heating oil (-1.10%).
5380 2018-11-02 19:58:44 really I must have missed the part where the sanctions on oil exports were waved and now they are free to make nukes...hmmm
5381 2018-11-02 19:58:43 women never get a oil change pullup past six mounths due and the check engine light on and  still think all it need is some oil

5386 2018-11-02 19:58:35 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
5387 2018-11-02 19:58:35 You’re forgetting the part where we allied with the Saudis because Iran (who also has lots of oil!) rejected our puppet government in a popular uprising
5388 2018-11-02 19:58:28 How so? If U.S. is now World’s Top Oil producer, how come the gasoline pump prices are still high and keeps on rising? Show the benefit at gas stations.
5389 2018-11-02 19:58:24 Snake oil anyone?
5390 2018-11-02 19:58:19 Portugal is 1000 years old, and your oil country? 100, maybe?

5405 2018-11-02 19:57:17 we support the Saudi's because of the oil they sell us, which is so important because we forbid iran to sell us oil.  We oppose the iranians because unlike the saudis they don't sell us any oil.
5406 2018-11-02 19:57:17 My oil change was a lot less than what I expected, hmm..
5407 2018-11-02 19:57:10 stop dropping bombs for oil and start caring about the people in your own country, and @ every politician who says they care for a couple extra votes: eat my entire ass
5408 2018-11-02 19:57:03 Today I took another step towards being full grown by taking the car to get the oil changed by myself.  #imnotacargirl #icanpumpgasandthatsit #tripleAornah #sorrynotsorry
5409 2018-11-02 19:57:02 That explains a lot. US #economy best it’s ever been while #Canada goes for higher taxes, more #regulation, dangerous oil trains over common sense #pipelines, bringing back #ISIS terrorists. #Trudeau the child imbicile just wasn’t ready after all

5420 2018-11-02 19:56:02 I heard about there being oil reserves in 1995. It has nothing to do with @nelsonchamisa or @edmnangagwa. This is about Zimbabwe. Remember the chinhoyi scandal varume vakuru kubvisa shangu paTV.

5439 2018-11-02 19:53:59 Hmm, did you try an oil? Even olive oil. If it left a stain try scrubbing with hydrogen peroxide. Godspeed. This makes me think of the Friends episode when Ross doodled on Rachel face with a pen lol.
5440 2018-11-02 19:53:55 Nah really.. I been paying $80 for my oil change for the last 3 years when it should’ve only been $35.
5441 2018-11-02 19:53:54 We all know that Erdogan, who writes in your newspaper, has expelled and imprisoned thousands of journalists and everyone knows that Turkey buys Syrian oil from ISIS and the last one who talks about human rights is Erdogan.
5442 2018-11-02 19:53:44 Should we buy oil finally
5443 2018-11-02 19:53:37 Of oil? I can do $250
5444 2018-11-02 19:53:37 WASHINGTON  - The United States said on Friday it will temporarily allow eight importers to keep buying Iranian oil when it reimposes sanctions on Monday to try to force Iran to curb its nuclear, missile and regional activities.
5445 2018-11-02 19:53:31 Tax will be laughed off and the extraction will accelerate in an effort to offset tax over longer time period. Fundamental rule should be - no exportbof oil and has unless all domestic supply met, and, export cost four to five times domestic price
5446 2018-11-02 19:53:30 Fun , performance,  rebellion,  a bitg fucking finger to the oil monopoly!

5449 2018-11-02 19:53:13 Taura hako, thank #Robert for groceries available in the shops, including cooking oil. 
Yeah thanks
5450 2018-11-02 19:53:12 So significantly less oil used for an electric cars life that your response is epically absurd. Crack a book.
5451 2018-11-02 19:53:00 If the US is granting waivers to eight countries in Asia on #IranSanctions how or when do we get to zero Iranian oil on the market?
5452 2018-11-02 19:52:55 Sometimes being an environmental specialist has its perks. We often have to look into environmental incidents (oil spills, etc). Today, I found my favorite incident:

In 2015, 50 Gallons of a mixed essential oil blend spilled onto a roadway in Springville, Utah.
5453 2018-11-02 19:52:55 Lol is that the car you're getting $60 oil changes for?
5454 2018-11-02 19:52:48 #COT = spec book for #oil as of 10/30/18, net long 432,638; change of 22,640 or 4.97% from prev. 455,278; 58.54% of 739,097 max on 2/6/18
5455 2018-11-02 19:52:46 Haha and there we have it.. Virgin born miracle worker or Middle Eastern hallucinating warlord and their ‘teachings’ trump scientific fact in your mind .. reason & logic suspended in favour of snake oil salesmen 
5456 2018-11-02 19:52:42 My guess is the price of oil will go up and then Trump will complain the price of oil is up.
5457 2018-11-02 19:52:28 I see that in my future as well.
5458 2018-11-02 19:52:25 Why isn’t this channel four news programme talking about the socialist leaders stealing Venezuela’s oil wealth and forcing a mass migration?
5459 2018-11-02 19:52:13 My new vision for the Niger Delta is that of a more robust developed region with world class schools, massive modern housing units, accessible road networks, a clean environment from oil spill and pollution, robust agriculture , adequate employment for the youths and peace.
5460 2018-11-02 19:52:05 You look stunning  So much oil on you. You are dripping in it  xxxx

5462 2018-11-02 19:51:40 I’ve been running on low oil for a couple of days now, my body went into deep sleep mode as soon as I got home. I know I’m not going to be able to fall asleep at night now.
5463 2018-11-02 19:51:38 Electric cars get their fuel from where? eventually you will use oil, somewhere down the line. So funny with Electric cars. Ride a bike.
5464 2018-11-02 19:51:36 I honestly don't know how without sounding like I'm pushing snake oil. So I don't know what to say or exactly what I'm looking for. Like, hey, I have some blog articles. Wanna publish them? Or can you write an article about a project or product of mine? I don't know.
5465 2018-11-02 19:51:34 I need an oil change 
5466 2018-11-02 19:51:28 The iran deal was working because Iranians were asking their government ok the sanctions have been lifted we want change and oil revenue to go to the people
5467 2018-11-02 19:51:25 Statement from EU, UK, Germany, France--@FedericaMog @JY_LeDrian @heikomaas @jeremyhunt @BrunoLeMaire @olafscholz @PhilipHammondUK--vows to work around US sanctions on #Iran. "We have committed to work on, inter alia... the continuation of Iran's export of oil and gas."

5469 2018-11-02 19:51:16 Do they deserve to be sent 6,000 miles away to kill some Muslim civilians on behalf of oil companies, Obomber?
5470 2018-11-02 19:51:14 Is Trump's sanction move a Putin directive intended to improve Russian oil position?
5471 2018-11-02 19:50:54 Its a tissue oil sold at clicks
5472 2018-11-02 19:50:54 Did you see the article on Zinke?  Seems he is sold out to an oil company because he has some land next door and will make tons of money.  Shocker.  And we're debating poor people who want to walk a 1000+ miles to earn a better life.
5473 2018-11-02 19:50:53 I TOOK A PIC OF THE STARRY NIGHT AND TOOK JIMINS THING FROM SERENDIPITY, NADE THE BACKGROUND TRANSPARENT AND PUT IT ON THE STARRY NUGHT AND THEN I USED MS WORD'S "ARTISTIC FILTER" OPTION TO EDIT PICTURES AND MAKE JIMIN AN OIL PAINTING LMAO NO ACTUAL DRAWING WENT INTK THIS
5474 2018-11-02 19:50:48 Of course The Greatest Showman would be friends with The Greatest Snake Oil Salesman. 
So disappointed by this.
5475 2018-11-02 19:50:40 Yes, let them know that the oil companies made billions while they lost their homes but you absurdly blame me or the govt for that.

Disgusting is your sycophantic apologies for an industry that doesn't care one bit about you, only profits
5476 2018-11-02 19:50:31 Let me break it down for you kiddo. Jared Polis has a plan to have Colorado on Renewable energy by 2040! This includes transitioning out of the oil and gas industry and into solar and wind power. On the other hand, Walker Stapleton is unfit to respresent us as Governor
5477 2018-11-02 19:50:28 I’m so sorry your dog is experiencing stress. Two things help our dog when there are fireworks or thunder:  rubbing his fur down with a non-toxic dryer sheet (some dogs react to the static electricity during storms) and CBD oil, which calms his nerves almost instantly.
5478 2018-11-02 19:50:06 Kill innocent brown people for the establishment. Oil doesn't grow on trees.
5479 2018-11-02 19:50:06 All the dirt bag loser Liverpool fans who tweeted “we want oil rich owners like man city or PSG” n abused FSG, oh boy you lots looklike John Terry after he was caught Wayne bridge’s wife
5480 2018-11-02 19:49:58 US asked Saudi Arabia to increase oil production while Iranian oil exports  are reduced from the market. Saudi Arabia has been very helpful to ensure an adequately supplied oil market during this period - US Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook
5481 2018-11-02 19:49:56 Aye bitches do not get oil changes
5482 2018-11-02 19:49:52 So they can take control of the Oil
5483 2018-11-02 19:49:51 But Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world. Zimbabwe doesn't.
5484 2018-11-02 19:49:44 Went to get an oil change and a fuel injection at 4 on Tuesday, I didn’t leave Walmart with my car until 7:15...
5485 2018-11-02 19:49:43 Hopefully not. Then again, I was horrified when I read about the unintended consequences of biofuels legislation for cars. That's what most palm oil is used for, it turns out, to make up the required biofuel component of petrol. Second-most popular choice is soya, which is worse.
5486 2018-11-02 19:49:33 that bead of oil running down Bob's face, nice touch
5487 2018-11-02 19:49:21 ugh i wanted to use coconut oil but alas, didn't have any on hand. MISTAKE

5491 2018-11-02 19:48:56 It’s because the entire footballing world laughs at City’s lack of professionalism and the various scandals they’re involved in financially, everyone expected this from Oil Money FC, and that’s only one of the reasons we despise them...
5492 2018-11-02 19:48:53 It’s sooo good they use like sunflower seed oil on It or something   They just pop It into the toaster over. Side note: they were out of the red holiday cup 
5493 2018-11-02 19:48:52 Lol their wages suck though unless you’re in the oil field
5494 2018-11-02 19:48:47 Radiation???? Weather control??? Satellite strikes (not that you can see) to shut down oil fields? HOW do you control the population the WORLD? Specific species of birds,fish,trees dead and dying all over the world...TIME to wake up! Global warming is a fictional State of science
5495 2018-11-02 19:48:34 I suppose that is why you have exempted the countries that actually buy any Iranian oil.
5496 2018-11-02 19:48:29 Ya think??? Reality is always in the way of ideology. Like oil and water.
5497 2018-11-02 19:48:22 I'm burning cedar essential oil in my cauldron burner and it smells so fucking amaaazing. I wanna bring it on vacation tomorrow

5500 2018-11-02 19:48:01 Things we export in Nigeria. 

1. Crude oil
2. Cocoa 
3. Doctors

5502 2018-11-02 19:47:48 Total snake oil, despicable display of lies, narcissism and delusion!  Actually it was a meltdown of a desparate man....If Florida buys this clown show, they deserve the destruction that will result.

5507 2018-11-02 19:47:14 WHERE IS KOMPANY NOW OOH COUNTING HIS WAGES COMMING FROM SELLING OIL NOT FROM FANS BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ANY
5508 2018-11-02 19:47:13 You just wanna go soak up their largest oil reserves on the planet in that greedy mustache of yours..
5509 2018-11-02 19:47:11 Where in zimbabwe are yy getting cooking oil at $3.50..not in zim shops
5510 2018-11-02 19:47:06 I have no idea what prima donna cheese flakes are. Sounds cheesy.

But yeah, when ingredients are high quality, less is more. Taste shines through and turns into a yummy feast. ( PS - I'd add some good olive oil to that salad :)
5511 2018-11-02 19:46:55 Car: Aveo & Oil was Pennzoil Synthetic Blend oil change which was $60 plus “other fixes” which came out to be $80
5512 2018-11-02 19:46:53 It was acceptable until The Universal Title then:-

Part time Brock destroyed Strowman and won the Jam belt
Miz got “injured”
Shane McMahon is the best in the world
4 50+ dudes fought for no reason other than oil money and Kane’s mask flew off his face.

5530 2018-11-02 19:44:38 Not totally correct. 

More Iranians banks will be getting cut off from swift than under the obama admin. 

Brian Hook has now stated that oil imports will be zeroed or near zeroed in 2019 with 2 of the 8 countries zeroing the imports in the next few week.
5531 2018-11-02 19:44:21 Hmmm...all @GOP with deep ties to oil and gas donations. What a surprise. As a former industry person, I don't see any willingness to be proactive. While true, a 2500 ft setback is necessarily scientific, it's also true that 2500 ft isn't a setback enough. #YesCOProp112
5532 2018-11-02 19:44:16 Is the company related to Invictus? I don't trust any oil story from you guys.
5533 2018-11-02 19:43:54 @AndrewScheer @jkenney whining about price Canada is getting for #TarSands oil blaming it on lack of pipelines well WTI oil has fallen from $76/barrel to $62.97 in one month the world us awash in light crude it does not need tar sands IMO
5534 2018-11-02 19:43:53 $ZN my oil play up today, thought it might fall below $1 there for coupla days. long term play, its gonna be bumpy
5535 2018-11-02 19:43:51 The football leaks stuff is old news rehashed with a clear anti city agenda... even the headlines refers to "oil money" which tells you all you need about their commitment to independent investigative journalism

5539 2018-11-02 19:43:21 This appears to be the largest & fastest liquidation of NYMEX Long Managed Money Futures Contracts ever recorded; ~280k sold in 3months..

5544 2018-11-02 19:42:34 Simple don't supply to the refineries at the international oil price. Since the oil is produced locally in Nigeria.
5545 2018-11-02 19:42:30 Birthday challenge update: took my car for an oil change. On the way one of my "neighbors" was in a big hurry and drove about 2 inches from my bumper. We both pulled into dunkin. I bought his coffee. When the road opened into 2 lanes, he saluted me with his coffee cup! 
5546 2018-11-02 19:42:13 IM GONNA KMS IM GETTING AN OIL CHANGE AND MY KEY HAS A DOG TAG THAT SAYS “LIZ WOULD DIE FOR BANGTAN”

5548 2018-11-02 19:41:59 Drips snake oil!
5549 2018-11-02 19:41:56 @pladis_Global I notice your Carr’s water biscuits contain palm oil. I am concerned. Is it from sustainable source and how do you confirm that?
5550 2018-11-02 19:41:47 @SlimmingWorld I can't find an answer to this anywhere; dried pasta is syn free, fresh pasta is a syn (presumably because of the oil), what about homemade pasta (made with just pasta flour(durum wheat) and eggs)?
5551 2018-11-02 19:41:16 Oh, I know about the continuous waves of hiring and layoffs in oil and gas in Texas. But.... psst. I'll tell you a secret. They're largely because oil companies don't care about people when they make their profit projections. They'll hire and fire with no thought to longevity.
5552 2018-11-02 19:41:08 It gives me immense joy and pleasure when someone uses Oil money, Arab F.C. to describe Man City
5553 2018-11-02 19:41:07 If only there was some way to get this oil to world markets. Alas, I cannot think of one. This problem will forever plague us. Other countries are so lucky all their oil is right by the coastline so this doesn’t affect them obviously.
5554 2018-11-02 19:40:59 I don't even have a lamp oil to lose, but i've still decided that im the king!

5567 2018-11-02 19:39:39 @VW it doesn’t make any sense how an oil change is $95 PLUS TAX but a full inspection isn’t included Besides full synthetic, what the hell am I paying for?????
5568 2018-11-02 19:39:35 No, it is Italy & Eni cooperating w/Muslim Brotherhood who r determined to grab all the wealth of any region in this so-called Libya. If there were no oil in Cyrenaica/Barqah none of them, EU etc would give a damn

5582 2018-11-02 19:38:05 It was in the mid-1970s that the British Pharmacopoeia, a publication of medical substance quality standards for the UK, released a licensed cannabis tincture which featured CBD in full-spectrum oil intended for therapeutic usage. #cbd #cbdoil #discusscannabis #cannabidiol

5587 2018-11-02 19:37:09 I do.

I'm a chemical process engineer and former Syncrude employee.

Ben is correct.

Bitumen is not oil. Comparisons between sweet crude and dilbit are completely pointless.

Alberta energy regulator, NEB, and oilsands operators took a gamble and lost.

5595 2018-11-02 19:35:51 No I’m talking about husky oil..and a billion dollar expansion and they changed their minds .. look it up maybe instead of talking so much maybe you would learn something..

5597 2018-11-02 19:35:48 A lesson on how to bring  a country to it’s knees without an invasion,get the Saudis’ to lower oil prices then impose sanctions,presto.
5598 2018-11-02 19:35:41 Go get an oil change
5599 2018-11-02 19:35:34 Mechanic presented the oil dipstick. I licked it, swished, spit into cup holder and knowingly said "very good".

Is the look he gave me sexist or was I just supposed to smell it?
5600 2018-11-02 19:35:27 Let’s get this water, salt, sugar, oil, yeast and flour and baked at 375 degrees 
5601 2018-11-02 19:35:11 I got more money in guns than you do princess, from muzzleloader to 300 Dakota.  I don’t need the mobbed up @NRA to protect the 2a, because it’s NOT under attack.  Sell your snake oil on a different corner.
5602 2018-11-02 19:35:04 This Teatree oil in my beard smells amazing. I don't even need Cologne lol
5603 2018-11-02 19:35:00 Gasoline crisis will be a real crisis in #venezuela when it reaches its capital.. and it slow and dangerously is doing it.. as simple as if no oil production and crumbling refineries and a dumb administration no gasoline .. nada. Zero. #oott

5605 2018-11-02 19:34:55 Ha, no, quite manageable! Nothing like that orange flavoured oil my mum used to give us!  They’re called @Eskimo3_Ireland
5606 2018-11-02 19:34:39 True. I only use a goat's milk soap on my face. And for moisturizer, a bottle of oil, grapeseed oil, & tea tree oil mixed
5607 2018-11-02 19:34:36 Seems like an extra little FU from life that everything delicious (olive oil, bacon grease, chocolate, wine) will probably stain your clothes.
5608 2018-11-02 19:34:35 The football leaks won’t result in any sanctions. The grip that these oil money Owner’s have on football is worth too much to Fifa and Uefa to even dare challenge.
5609 2018-11-02 19:34:30 What man in his right man could fire a pro cheerleader on her knees? (asking for a friend)
5610 2018-11-02 19:34:13 That time when you punch in $CL in Bloomberg and think it’s oil .......
5611 2018-11-02 19:34:10 Me: “I finally have a weekend where I don’t have ANYTHING planned!”
Me 5 minutes later: “I could dye my hair, get my oil changed, hang out with some people...”
5612 2018-11-02 19:34:05 many countries are keep buying Iranian oil in large quantities even after sanctions and keep doing business in their own currencies! Only economically rich but militarily weak EU countries have no option but to obey!
5613 2018-11-02 19:33:54 .  Extra oil
5614 2018-11-02 19:33:44 Cruz is the most hated man in the Senate for a reason. He lies. Beto's campaign take no PAC $ and Teddie is the Swamp's best customer: lobbyists put $ in and get the laws they want out the other end. Use your brain and reject the Cruz campaign's snake oil. Texas can do better.
5615 2018-11-02 19:33:38 Public outrage is directed towards a snake oil salesman, as corporate America accumulates power, destroys the planet, and foments war. #ResistOligarchy #MedicareForAll #Peace
5616 2018-11-02 19:33:16 Love it!  Own it baby.  Either way the #oil on fire and we need to enjoy it.
5617 2018-11-02 19:33:14 I thought Nigeria produces crude oil. I understand production cost in Nigeria is under $10/barrel. Or are we buying crude in international crude spot markets?
5618 2018-11-02 19:33:02 @stevenmnuchin1 
Let me put it this way if you don't hurry and give me my Stock , Bonds , and Cash, I'm going to ask The King Of Saudi Arabia to reconsider all concessions for the original Standard Oil of California startup money for Aramco except my shares Jacklyn Kennedy.
5619 2018-11-02 19:32:46 take it back they all like to sit at the robot bar and drink oil together...

5622 2018-11-02 19:32:26 When I grow up I want to stay in Muzarabani because @edmnangagwa 's big nose smells oil in that area..
5623 2018-11-02 19:32:23 Nice.....but you should have just moved and quit your job instead of taking vacation and fixing up your place. Also, just buy a new ride when the oil needs changed.
5624 2018-11-02 19:32:10 Louisiana Vote BLUE, Did you know that the Trump administration stopped all the funding for environmental cleanup, like oil spills and then removed all regulations set in place after Deep water Horizon oil Catastrophe!
5625 2018-11-02 19:32:06 just spent nearly $100 on an oil change, inspection and gas. i wanna cry
5626 2018-11-02 19:31:55 Slingshot to a penny would do quite nicely thank you
5627 2018-11-02 19:31:50 This massive legislative, policy, institutional reforms and transparent unbundling and liberalization of our oil and gas sector shall attract very conservatively  non-fiscal investments of over $15billion-$30billion  into the whole value chain of our oil and gas sector within
5628 2018-11-02 19:31:49 Finally got my oil changed
5629 2018-11-02 19:31:45 Dear lady in the oil change place. Please control your 1,400 children
5630 2018-11-02 19:31:44 @MktwSaefong , trying to trade oil and gold. Who do you follow /trust the most?
5631 2018-11-02 19:31:41 We have a 40 year low in unemployment, we don't control the price of oil and any party telling you they can is flat-out lying and as for waste? audits have been fine as of late...and some is subjective pending what you support paying for too.

5634 2018-11-02 19:31:29 Weird when oil prices are falling, as is the yuan.
5635 2018-11-02 19:31:25 Wow come to Dallas and do my oil change.
5636 2018-11-02 19:31:23 of the upstream, midstream and downstream oil and gas sector. A transparent and accountable reform that will eliminate/weed out the corruption driven/created over 30 million liters per day ghost consumers created from January 2016, under Buhari.
5637 2018-11-02 19:31:15 Presidente sin pensión. You have the oil surpluses of your sexenniun. If You cooperante for the wall, You have them. Return them to México are not yours.

5640 2018-11-02 19:30:59 Social media caught the old guard by surprise. Now the oil and gas mantra all in flames. LETS USE SOCIAL FOR GOOD CAUSE
5641 2018-11-02 19:30:56 Ps. There is no Scottish oil. It’s our U.K. oil.

5647 2018-11-02 19:30:22 Current plan of letting in everyone who shows up, turning a blind eye to those entering illegally is not a plan. It's a recipe for disaster. 
How left has convinced people this is in their best interest and beneficial to their lives and families is beyond me
5648 2018-11-02 19:30:21 lmaoooo you wanna take my car to get a oil change ? I got the money i just don’t feel like going

5650 2018-11-02 19:29:59 And one more thing.  If you live in Calgary, you will notice that the people who own condos in Hawaii still own condos in Hawaii.  $20/barrel oil hurts the Keg waiter a lot more than the O&G CEO.
5651 2018-11-02 19:29:55 It’s pretty simple. If there’s no demand then there’s no reason to drill. The oil and gas industry is like any other industry. It’s fueled by the consumer.
5652 2018-11-02 19:29:55 obama......modern day snake oil salesman!!!
5653 2018-11-02 19:29:54 Why is Fox News airing Obama rallying in Florida, I don’t know!  He is definitely a snake oil salesman.  But, what I remember is how they tried to take away our 2nd amendment rights, I remember them trying to control our ammo.  I remember terrorist being released from Gitmo.
5654 2018-11-02 19:29:44 I was making food and hot oil splashed in my face and burnt me how are you today?
5655 2018-11-02 19:29:44 That place has your biggest oil depot. And was used to store sulphur for long.
5656 2018-11-02 19:29:23 @costcocanada Stay away! We have a 2012 BMW that we took to COSTCO for an oil change. They took it for a test drive (who does that for an oil change) and ceased the motor. They are not accepting responsibility and have left us with a $29,000 repair bill.
5657 2018-11-02 19:29:17 I live in the oil patch country and have a way better idea what he has done than obviously you do.. And ALL the Investors that are now hindered because all the new regulations they have and are continually are doing.. yeah they are all going to the US where there is NONE.
5658 2018-11-02 19:29:13 Find a good coconut oil.
5659 2018-11-02 19:29:12 Unemployment, price of Canadian oil, how much money the federal government wastes. Need I go on!
5660 2018-11-02 19:29:10 She’s a snake oil salesmen that’s all I’m saying
5661 2018-11-02 19:29:02 If you had only one match and entered a dark room containing an oil lamp, some kindling wood, and a newspaper, which would you light first?

5663 2018-11-02 19:28:54 Maybe Megan Woods could call Sroubek a gas & oil commodity and in that way he will be banned.
Would make as much sense as her other calls.

5668 2018-11-02 19:28:12 @ClintonFdn you know something science and God have always been like oil and water but I see science as a blessing(IF USED THE WAY IT WAS INTENDED..why else do you think so much intelligence WAS GIVEN?)
5669 2018-11-02 19:28:10 Well, let's see. First the earth cooled. And then the dinosaurs came, but they got too big and fat, so they all died and they turned into oil. And then the Arabs came and they bought Mercedes Benzes. And Prince Charles started wearing all of Lady Di's clothes
5670 2018-11-02 19:28:06 Yet nothing will happen to them.. free to buy the league with their oil money
5671 2018-11-02 19:27:51 Hello! What type of castor oil so you use? Could you recommend a brand please :)
5672 2018-11-02 19:27:45 The price differential is spin. 

The market for bitumen is completely different than the market for sweet crude oil.

Comparing the price of those two commodities is nonsense.

Who else, but Alberta oilsands operators, are trying to sell this stuff on the world market?
5673 2018-11-02 19:27:41 —sell car oil, cleaning products and the like. Then he hit up the Slushee machine before getting back in his car. He drove slow down the road where he left Tulip, wondering if he would see her again, since she said she had no place to be.
5674 2018-11-02 19:27:38 When it comes to govt, we hear loud complaints about 'spending other people's money,’ from media giants, oil barons, pharma kings, war makers, & bankers. The only thing we have to keep these complainers in check is the government we vote for. We should choose wisely. #VoteBlue

5677 2018-11-02 19:27:34 You have that backwards. Saudi Arabia wealth and oil controls the United States.
5678 2018-11-02 19:27:29 #Obama is still the snake oil salesman & a lot of the sheeple are still buying. Hopefully, there are more woke folks who aren’t falling for the lousy economy, higher ins. costs for working Americans, less jobs and lies he promotes.

OK?
5680 2018-11-02 19:27:05 If it's warmer on the surface couldn't #oil spills contribute to warming the #ocean since most oils are less dense, they hold heat and wasn't properly cleaned up by oil companies? Just wondering.
5681 2018-11-02 19:26:53 SWEAR Get my oil changed shit
5682 2018-11-02 19:26:45 Only in Zimbabwe will you see gullible people pushed by those in the Diaspora to celebrate shortages, closure of companies, failure of the Oil exploration, educated fools are in Zim, they celebrate their own demise, hanzi zvadirwa jecha, Varakashi handei ne Zim, @gundwenation
5683 2018-11-02 19:26:41 He’s selling snake oil. He thinks all conservatives sound like that.
5684 2018-11-02 19:26:33 How can I get an oil change if there was no oil to change
5685 2018-11-02 19:26:29 Pockets hurting cause i had to replace my battery on top of getting get an oil change. But I’m blessed i was able to do it. Even in the midst of  of it all I’m going to make the best out of it!
5686 2018-11-02 19:26:26 
5687 2018-11-02 19:26:23 WE could use prison ships like they did in the days of the Napoleonic wars, JRM would especially appreciate that.....

We could use those requisitioned ferries that we will have no use for when we #stopbrexit.

JRM should be chained in a pool of engine oil on the car deck ....

In a way, it’s a relief to finally bid you adieu.
And while I may not care for you as a person, I’ll continue to show your reporting professional courtesy.

Or is it fuel he promised us he will bring d pump price down to N45  but few months into his administration pushed it to N145? Hmm
5693 2018-11-02 19:25:34 Yeah well @JohnBrennan good thing no one really gives a shit what you believe. Thanks for trying to be relevant again though.

We have installed a new gasket and hope this does the trick.
5703 2018-11-02 19:24:34 Management wants to keep it as far as I know, they have enough free cash flow to cover it as long as oil prices hold up
5704 2018-11-02 19:24:30 Did he mention PDP? maybe you weren't listening properly,former minister of finance adviced the Governors to allow FG to save money from crude oil ,but, the myopic Govs rejected it including peter obi  himself then he was in APGA party.

5706 2018-11-02 19:23:48 Is that a drip tray underneath to catch the inevitable oil leak caused by excess crankcase pressure?

5722 2018-11-02 19:22:18 The term “food miles” refers to how many miles your food has to travel to get to you. There are more benefits to eating local than are obvious…for example, did you know it takes approximately 25 gallons of oil to produce one truck tire?
5723 2018-11-02 19:22:18 I use essential oils. Doterra has an oil called Past tense. It's pretty awesome. Water...dehydration causes headaches so lots of water.  Hang in there, I hate pills too.

5734 2018-11-02 19:20:42 Not simply an academic question.  
Considering the number of countries with people in the exact same conditions with the exact desire to come, it's a real question that deserves real answers. They will come and perhaps in increasing numbers. What is the plan?
5735 2018-11-02 19:20:41 Yes I am.
5736 2018-11-02 19:20:35 I was thinking more of philanthrophic foundations that are funded by the estates of oil tycoons who died long ago.
5737 2018-11-02 19:20:32 Try coconut oil. If that fails, break out the Noxema.
5738 2018-11-02 19:20:30 I doubt the oil discovery in Zimbabwe is something new. Maybe new news to the public but I bet it's pretty much the reason the west despised Mugabe
5739 2018-11-02 19:20:08 Bebeu o oil
5740 2018-11-02 19:20:04 Yeah. The moment I noticed BP in the list of people who paid for the ad, was the moment my mind was made up to clean up our environment, our air, and our water.

Screw Big Oil.

5751 2018-11-02 19:19:17 I'm talking about multiple issues with Dems. As for the Saudis: there's never been an administration, Democrat or Republican, who didn't bend over backwards to accommodate brutal despots in exchange for oil and empire.
5752 2018-11-02 19:19:15 I have never been to Ft L. A typical sex trip for a week tends to cost over $2k. Since the slow down in the oil industry & my income dropped 65%, I only travel when someone pays for all trip costs.

5766 2018-11-02 19:18:11 OMG Obama lying his ass off in Miami. Acting like he's the truth teller. Snake oil saleman.

5768 2018-11-02 19:18:05 I can see fusion power as the next space race.  It will be more for purpose of energy independence and supremacy, if China for example solved issue, they could rid themselves of need from foreign oil
5769 2018-11-02 19:17:58 eyyy why don’t we all get solar powered cars?? if we wanna reduce pollution, that’s the way to go. but guess what? America’s economy is run off oil and gas so haha we all know what we find more important: money. when we all die cos the planet can’t sustain us anymore, your money
5770 2018-11-02 19:17:52 OMG this @masterchefau season is on fire!  Yes, yes, I know we're way behind here in the UK, but I love it (esp contestants who've grown up with it, & so have planned for things like "always pick salt, pepper, water & oil in ingredients pressure tests" etc etc!)

5773 2018-11-02 19:17:22 The reporting stands. It remains accurate. Oil waivers to 8 countries - despite vow not to do - are being issued. No push to zero out anymore. Iran keeps Swift connection with nebulous claim Treasury can patrol transactions. Still no date on enforcement. See Rubio statement tday.

5779 2018-11-02 19:16:58 I’m in Amsterdam; I read up a bit before I got here...interesting that the city was becoming so car dependent in the 60s/70s that engineers considered concreting in the canals before they went down the bike route, mainly due to public protest & oil prices? Why can’t we do this?
5780 2018-11-02 19:16:41 What of this Scot McMillan guy’s interview saying they are excited about the prospect...and yuh oil is only declared to have been discovered when it gushes out of the exploration well...

5791 2018-11-02 19:15:53 No.
Majority Rules? What happens to individual rights? What if the majority votes to take your home? Or that oil companies give gas away?
Majority rule leads to riots and chaos.
This is why we have the Electoral College, and why we should repeal the 17th amendment.

5800 2018-11-02 19:14:52 You generally need an oil based solution. Even olive or coconut oil in a pinch.

5807 2018-11-02 19:13:44 Yeah, there are some very obvious things to do for longevity, like exercise and stop smoking and drinking. 

But the notion that we're going to find a hack or a drug to increase it is snake oil. We evolved to be mortal, and the term seems pretty hard-wired.
5808 2018-11-02 19:13:44 I got a Christmas Spirit essential oil and I’m diffusing it right now bc hey, there’s only 7 more Friday’s until Christmas 
5809 2018-11-02 19:13:40 it is, but one needs a bit of vanilla (baking oil) and sugar to make it tasty ... as not sure if that is always the case, but my chickpea liquid was a bit salty. And I threw a bit of corn stache in as it became a bit too liquid after mixing^^

5834 2018-11-02 19:10:49 @RachelNotley Has anyone thought about cutting the flow to washington refiners and divert to port of Burnaby, just one tanker load a week so that a message can be sent to US refiners that canadian oil expects to be treated fairly.

5840 2018-11-02 19:10:21 You do realise that part of the Gov role is to make investors comfortable investing in Canada, then Premiers & Mayors sell their province & city for them to invest there. Alberta had so many years of Con's rule that thought oil was all you needed,

Unfortunately this administration hunts them down, arrest the perpetrators and blow up their poorly set up refineries. These folks supply fuel used by locals in villages to make garri, run sawmills, produce palm oil etc
5870 2018-11-02 19:08:18 Ask him if he still thinks North sea oil is underwriting Westminsters failure to balance it's books
5871 2018-11-02 19:08:16 @QuentinWillson @FairFuelUK  why are you so quiet about oil companies big profits and rising prices? have you got shares in them?
5872 2018-11-02 19:08:06 For sure, respect, and I make my own now with baking soda and cocoa fat and coconut oil because I’m a homesteading weirdo. But anti perspirant doesn’t cause breast cancer for those who see this later.

5881 2018-11-02 19:07:18 @ABDanielleSmith Has anyone looked at reducing the amount of oil going to the refineries in Washington State and divert to an oil tanker in Burnaby, like just one more per week, This would send a message to the USA refineries that Canadian oil is not going to be sold cheap
5882 2018-11-02 19:07:04 I used to over oil guns. Not because of any other reason than that's what dad did. Old 30-30 and a .22 long rifle. Without thought I transferred that to everyone of my guns. Bought my 2nd gen G22 and seen how little oil was recommended and had to look up, learn how. Much happier!

5912 2018-11-02 19:05:14 Off topic but- If the US had spent 1/4 of the money on fighting oil wars in the Middle East & instead built hospitals, schools, housing & infrastructure, there wouldn’t be all the problems we have now. Fucking military industrial complex is responsible for the murder of thousands
5913 2018-11-02 19:05:11 @realDonaldTrump You need to increase the influence of Bolton and Koushner, because it is in your favor. I'm not satisfied that eight countries were exempted from the oil embargo, but they can not afford to pay oil because they are good.

5918 2018-11-02 19:04:26 Cost of refining, transportation and logistics will not bring pms to less than 80naira with the current price of crude. Unless we remove all taxes, subsidize the crude and lose revenue  on oil ... means less money to spend on other sectors as oil is our main source of cash.

5926 2018-11-02 19:03:24 @PepperidgeFarm it’s really disappointing that your products can use palm oil. We’ve become a palm oil free household so we can no longer support you. Please look into palm oil free and becoming sustainable!
5927 2018-11-02 19:03:21 Trump has not caved on Iran. If you examine the sanctions then you will see that they are stronger than Obama’s sanctions. The number of banks cut from swift will be bigger than before, oil exports will be cut more and more regime entities face sanctions than before.
5928 2018-11-02 19:03:18 Would oil companies think for a second about keeping drivers on their payroll if they could have self driving trucks? I think not because big oil doesnt care. Its all about greed. Yet their employees are so brainwashed they choose No on 112. Im voting #YESon112 !

5945 2018-11-02 19:01:27 > When would England ever accept a deal that took 9% of its resources?
They hid our oil ealth ,then lied about it ,then voted to take 92% of it and the same people say we are too skint for indy.
And in  REAL union we would`nt have to ask permission to vote!
5946 2018-11-02 19:01:10 It will be wise to wait for the result and buy after result, buying at 50% premium after oil hit is worth rather than losing 50% on duster
5947 2018-11-02 19:01:04 The other major exporters of oil, Russia, Venezuela, and OPEC, manipulate production and export levels for worldwide economic and political purposes. None of these issues can get resolved because of the Left's animosity towards fossil fuels, resulting in higher gas prices.

Please give me money!
5956 2018-11-02 19:00:25 It depends. If it's produced on deforested areas, it's not vegan. That's the case with industrial palm oil, which can be found in a lot of processed foods and cosmetics, it's not the case with the palm oil that has been used for ages in regions like Africa to cook.

I used it in Italy while on dig sites & it protected me all but 1 day.
6005 2018-11-02 18:55:10 U.S. to allow eight countries to temporarily import Iran’s oil despite sanctions WHY HAS THE WORLD HAVE TO KISS TRUMPS FAT PIMPLED ASS TO DO ANYTHING.A  FASCIST DICTATORSHIP RAN BY PUTIN.
6006 2018-11-02 18:55:00 Oh my goodness it’s going to be mahoosive !!! nobody should be forgotten or suffer endless days of loneliness - it costs nothing to keep an eye on someone and small gestures can make so much difference  #Dontdancealone

6007 2018-11-02 18:54:52 Why not do like Europe? Buy oil from Iran and let payments go by the central banks. That way money flows won't be traceable.
6008 2018-11-02 18:54:43 Is anybody trading crude oil?
6009 2018-11-02 18:54:40 Like minor “Carr” issues u know lil tune up change the oil rotate the tires. Get a couple of parts from pick n pull

6011 2018-11-02 18:54:39 Its our fans who fund us and our owners actually bleed us dry whilst city wouldn’t finish top 10 without the oil funding them as if they have enough fans to fund a squad like that
6012 2018-11-02 18:54:39 The oil is too real
6013 2018-11-02 18:54:33 Trump is bad ass negotiator, how did he get every country to agree on Iranian oil import ban? 

Obama couldn’t get 20 countries to agree during the last ban on Iran.

6020 2018-11-02 18:53:59 Move off oil, problem solved, Canada goes green. With all the bs oil companies have done and lied about amd continue to lie about, I feel no pity.

Why is westminster fighting to keep a country it claims costs it 13 BN PER YEAR? it makes no sense 
Scotland is a resource rich country,our oil alone has propped up UK for 50 years.

6028 2018-11-02 18:53:06 What? Iranian oil doesn't directly affect U.S. Gas prices. Are you high? Look at who we import oil from. Then look who we EXPORT to. Then look at what gas in your states costs vs another state. Taxes. Local, state etc are the reason gas costs what it does.
6029 2018-11-02 18:53:04 An old political hack trying to stay on the scene... by the way what did he ever do about all the money taken from the Mexican people through graft and Corruption of Mexican oil revenues

6044 2018-11-02 18:50:40 I really need to get gas and this oil change
6045 2018-11-02 18:50:33 This is offensive to me as a man and a figurative oil painter — and I cannot explain exactly why. 

Maybe it's because a female nude in art has always been the whole message, and anything political, religious or social added actually detracts.
6046 2018-11-02 18:50:23 BHO made it all about him for 8 years of disaster  & would still be selling his snake oil thru Hillary if it wasn’’t for @realDonaldTrump  taking control to rebuild what u & Democrats have destroyed. He’s for the people & we know it

6054 2018-11-02 18:49:51 We have an essential oil blend called “Calming” in our diffuser as we speak.
6055 2018-11-02 18:49:49 I prefer legislation for something like this, as technology and capabilities will change.  With any luck, a generation or two down the line "fracking" (and maybe even "oil and gas") will be a non-issue.  Longevity of applicability is (in my ignorant mind) a good qualifier.
6056 2018-11-02 18:49:43 From thousands of years there were Jews living in what was then caled Palestine. If you start digging the land, anywere in Israel, you'll find Jewish objects or even coins. Maybe a Menorah!!  Sorry, no oil there, budy...No Kings, Emirs, Dictators or Murderous Thugs too...
6057 2018-11-02 18:49:26 The difference between Trump and the Left is that the latter has no plan to lower gas prices. For starters, you guys don't even like fossil fuels (although they're essential). You protest against drilling for oil here. No one wants to import oil from the Saudis. What's your plan?
6058 2018-11-02 18:49:26 A friend of the family who was offered a place in a hospice 3 months ago is at home and holding his own. I would certainly use it if I had a diagnosis like yours. I’ll try to find a vid of Rick Simpson making and discussing his oil. Hope all goes well for you.

Just saying, if you’re struggling as well, try tea tree oil.

6085 2018-11-02 18:46:24 Washington has allowed eight countries to continue to buy Iranian oil temporarily, despite officially announcing sanctions on Tehran next Monday. Turkey says it is among those exempted countries

6091 2018-11-02 18:45:47 You take the little chicken hearts, dredge them in flour, egg, then flour spices mixture. Toss em into hot oil and deep fry them to golden brown. Serve with dipping sauces like bbq, honey mustard, or white gravy. They're bite sized and delicious.
6092 2018-11-02 18:45:47 WTF...do we need to see that airhead jackie deangelis every hour to bash the $oil non-stop?

6096 2018-11-02 18:45:35 You can also try cocoa butter. It’s rich and makes you smell good down there. Have you tried drinking a mix of oil and vinegar for your stones? Any salad dressing will do. You can use the extra on lettuce.
6097 2018-11-02 18:45:31 Don't be naive. Did we ever see any benefits from the Marange diamond find? What makes you think it's gonna be any different with oil?
6098 2018-11-02 18:45:27 We know it's a lie. There is no oil, a blue lie to divert attention from queen b.
6099 2018-11-02 18:45:27 Gas was $1.69 when Trump took office, oil was at $30.
Now gas is $2.80 and oil is at $65.
Not sure what waivers will do, but Trump has been bad for consumers.

He will not be used as a pawn to pit Saudi against America, which will cause the price of oil to rise and thus hopefully America will not impose the sanctions on Iran.

6108 2018-11-02 18:44:26 Just saw you’re tweet. It is cannabis oil, the woman from Coventry featured on This Morning tv show took it and her stage 4 cancer has gone. Jeremy Kyle did a show fairly recently investigating the claims of its effectiveness - he said he would use it now. >
6109 2018-11-02 18:44:26 Didn’t you allow continued export of Iranian oil to few countries.
6110 2018-11-02 18:44:23 True. Zimplats prospered where BHP floundered. It happens. But I guess Mobil would also have better technology than then, and if the interest were as we have highlighted, would they give up to a smaller firm and not sell to the big oil firms?

6114 2018-11-02 18:44:03 Reasons why it won't work:
1 Iran's oil exports won't be zeroed out.
2 China (trade war) and Russia (sancions) are unlikely to co-operate. The EU and other countries oppose the sanctions.
3 The policy relies on the dominance of the dollar as the reserve currency. That is changing

Try putting lavender or peppermint essential oil in your temples and back of your neck. See if it helps! It helped me!!!!
6118 2018-11-02 18:43:52 It’s really hard to generalize because the CBD in most of the country is snake oil but the CBD in dispensaries, especially on the west coast, has a different composition and is trusted by many patients. I think that awareness is missing from these pieces.

6124 2018-11-02 18:43:06 MD of NIOC : "It’s clearly impossible to remove Iran’s #oil from the market. It’s not yet known whether these exemptions will be permanent or temporary; we must negotiate in order to determine such results." #OOTT

6126 2018-11-02 18:42:39 One of the main criticism the Venezuelan government gets is that at the height of the oil boom in the mid 2000s they were also increasing the country’s debt, which for many didn’t make sense and led to allegations of mismanagement since then.
6127 2018-11-02 18:42:33 As opposed to oil companies making billions while polluting the planet.
6128 2018-11-02 18:42:24 Butter and coconut oil! And everyone used to think it was super weird until the 'Keto' diet became a fad.
6129 2018-11-02 18:42:19 One great example why the news is truly #FakeNews and an enemy of humanity. Most news outlets are owned by the energy and communication companies. They would never report millions of gallons of oil leaking into the ocean for 14 years.
6130 2018-11-02 18:42:19 The oil change place had Fox news blaring and I heard them say something like "people really like manchin right now" so that's how bad he's gotten.

6141 2018-11-02 18:41:32 It’s actually much better to go on low added sugar diet! It keeps you lean and healthy! Most fats like olive oil, coconut oil, milk fat are very healthy!!
6142 2018-11-02 18:41:23 Canada has 170 billoon barr. of oil reserves but we could be hitting recession..this tantamount to winning Superball Lotto 1 Billion but being broke in 4 yrs.

6143 2018-11-02 18:41:21 But Iraq doesn’t need money; it needs companies’ assistance on rebuilding & reconstruction ; and double oil output ( in barrels per day). We need to build a pipeline to Haifa /11

6148 2018-11-02 18:40:35 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.
6149 2018-11-02 18:40:35 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

6151 2018-11-02 18:40:28 @HeymanHustle might be one of the best managers in sports entertainment but damn if he doesn’t sound like if Zazu from Lion King got something in his throat.

6167 2018-11-02 18:39:21 Has Mario Batali divested from Eataly yet because I’m in the neighborhood and really want some olive oil but not if it means supporting the patriarchy

6169 2018-11-02 18:39:16 Yeah obviously you havent because they have gone through the gov taking their land and flooding it with oil. You are apart of the issue yall take with no consequences and complain when people bring it up.
6170 2018-11-02 18:39:05 No, that's not what I said. Please read it again and try not to make such a twat of yourself this time. 

How much do you think the oil and gas revenues are each year?

6176 2018-11-02 18:38:31 I’m not a fan of makeup removing wipes (more of a micellar water and oil girl). But my sister left these cocoa butter wipes at my house and babyyyyy the are like no other.
6177 2018-11-02 18:38:24 We would recommend the DT50.  That is our air cooled 15W-50 oil developed in conjunction with Raby Aircooled Technology
6178 2018-11-02 18:38:19 story time i once tried to make aloo tikki w some left over boiled potatoes except i used hair oil instead of cooking oil my mom didn't let me cook for a while after that
6179 2018-11-02 18:38:10 Make salad dressing! Mix 3 parts pumpkin seed oil with 1 part rice vinegar and 1 part avocado. Add oregano and honey to taste.
6180 2018-11-02 18:38:06 I done brought my whole book bag and lap top in the oil change place  I got work to do.
6181 2018-11-02 18:38:02 Yet it has the the biggest oil reservoirs in the world

6183 2018-11-02 18:37:49 In last 24 hours:
1. Brent down almost 4%
2. USDINR down almost 1.5%
*3. So oil is cheaper by ~5.5% in a day*
4. US govt seems to be in a mood to allow Indian Oil imports from Iran without much sanctions.
*5. GST collections cross 1 lakh crore mark*
6184 2018-11-02 18:37:46 Tires lose air? What? Whats next, an oil change??? I AM CONFUSION

6186 2018-11-02 18:37:37 Have you ever checked out Youngblood's in Greenfield? We use their essential oil based flea and tick shampoo and spray for our furbaby. They have educated me so much about natural options for our doggo!
6187 2018-11-02 18:37:36 "fish oil" aye..."fish oil"
6188 2018-11-02 18:37:26 Before or after the oil sale????????
6189 2018-11-02 18:37:21 Shocking mate. Putting a show on for the Oil rich Arabs who have the worst record for Human Rights in the world. It's a disgrace
6190 2018-11-02 18:37:20 Right after this, Tippin went out back and proceeded to change everyone’s oil. Seriously, Tippin’s Arkansas waterfall is supremely underrated.
6191 2018-11-02 18:37:17 อิคนเทฮยอกโอเพื่อนไม่รับเข้าแก๊ง!!!!
6192 2018-11-02 18:37:16 I made a pie recipe using olive oil once and it was really bad. But my cooking often is anyway.
6193 2018-11-02 18:37:07 I’m . I need an oil change.
6194 2018-11-02 18:37:02 Heard Zim discovered crude oil 
6195 2018-11-02 18:36:56  just expanded the pic. Ooops. Would go Neck Oil and Earl Grey if I was limited to 2 though!

6197 2018-11-02 18:36:51 Hmm...maybe #CopWife put cold germies on the “mess with your SO” remote control? ;)
Hope you feel better soon! Homemade chicken soup with olive oil, fresh lemon and lots of garlic always does the healing trick!
6198 2018-11-02 18:36:43 That Australia should not write oil in developed countries
6199 2018-11-02 18:36:43 Coconut oil, drop of cinnamon bark essential oil and multi-collagen protein. Or a lavender and honey simple syrup.
6200 2018-11-02 18:36:42 Please don’t use coconut oil, it lifts the pigment. Use a really mild moisturizer like cetaphil
6201 2018-11-02 18:36:26 Bad things happen when you build a city on mud islands.

6203 2018-11-02 18:36:08 Research who is behind the political ads before you decide if you agree.There’s an ad running in NM saying that progressives shouldn’t vote for Dems. The PAC's Board of Directors are Mining/Oil/Gas execs and former R candidates. Of course they don’t want you to vote D!
6204 2018-11-02 18:36:07 yeah, it also has a cool pokemon-eqsue twist ( for lack of a better term) by allowing you to use the elements and the environment, like lighting oil on fire or freezing water, which definitely gives it a more pen and paper feel thanks to that variety and openness

6207 2018-11-02 18:35:34 Can’t believe on my first ever shift a man came in starting taking his clothes off and rubbing his feet with some oil to clean them Lmfaoo whyyy
6208 2018-11-02 18:35:32 Small businesses are going the way of the Dodo.  Sears just went bankrupt.  Jeff Bezos now the richest man in the world. Last time this country seriously enforced anti-trust laws was what?  Standard Oil? Or was it Theodore Roosevelt?

In any case, workers are being screwed royal.
6209 2018-11-02 18:35:30 You stand in an office, which is nearly empty but for an oil lamp sitting on a chest of drawers.
6210 2018-11-02 18:35:19 Their economy failed due to reliance on oil and dropping oil prices. This happens in capitalism as well.
6211 2018-11-02 18:35:18 Because it is a tradition for an American president to kiss their asses because they have oil and are helping kill people in the Middle East.
6212 2018-11-02 18:35:13 The thread. Nigel Farage, Julian Assange, Cambridge Analytical, Luke Oil, Brad Parscale, Robert Mercer. Steve Bannon, Black Cube. The whistleblower, Christopher Wiley, has laid this conspiracy bare before both the House and the Senate as well as the EU. Repub CONGRESS IGNORED IT!
6213 2018-11-02 18:35:11 Looking further into the EIA August production #s.. According to the TRRC TX there were 601 oil wells completed in TX in August vs. 940 oil wells completed in July yet production +126kbpd MoM? Need to assume a massive increase in well productivity or is EIA counting NGLs? #OOTT
6214 2018-11-02 18:35:10 Why increase bureaucracy by having to enforce collection? Just oil the wheels of commerce and pay for it with a fuel levy or sell SAA. I'm in CT and don't mind paying a bit more for fuel to fund the gauteng freeway, swings and roundabouts... Just not bureaucracy please!!
6215 2018-11-02 18:35:08 Literally I can take a flosser and scrape the bottom of his teeth 
I lowkey want to put him on to oil pulling 
6216 2018-11-02 18:34:53 In the fiscal year 1015/16 Scots sent £53.7bn to the UK Treasury and got back £30.4bn,  Westminster kept £23.3bn.  That and after stealing >£1trn of our oil and with $2trn untapped reserves that is is the reason they came north in their droves to plead with us to stay.
6217 2018-11-02 18:34:44 If they prosper we hope we will have greater stability in the southern African region... but oil seems to bring violence with it for third world and developing countries...
6218 2018-11-02 18:34:36 In a queue Shoprite in Gleridge I met 3 siblings. One has a burnt hand..the older one whom I think is 14 is wearing torn uniform esp jersey. .they bought castor oil only..I forgot to take their house No I just became emotional and go to my pocket..I wish to meet them again
6219 2018-11-02 18:34:34 Trump is putting sanctions on Iran the 6th, and SWIFT will no longer be allowed to do business with Iran to move their oil money. Will they use XRP? Is this Trump taking big business from SWIFT (since they don’t want to play ball) and helping Ripple XRP and America WIN?
6220 2018-11-02 18:34:33 Bros, Saudi Arabia refines all their oil, yet their prices are higher to Nigeria's. Ivory Coast/Cameroon/Niger has local refineries but fuel prices higher than ours.

Thought you were open to review your position with new info. Seems you won't.
6221 2018-11-02 18:34:33 all you are is a showman.. the big Kahuna, big daddy, snake oil sales man.. The biggest show on earth.. the thug, the bully,  the narcissist.
6222 2018-11-02 18:34:08 I think you're saying the same thing I am.
6223 2018-11-02 18:34:07 Lmao. If these leaks are proven, FIFA, UEFA and these Oil Rich football clubs are gonna get fucked
6224 2018-11-02 18:34:05 Zimbabwe has discovered oil. Exploration to start in 2020. So very happy for the people of Zimbabwe, this will be a much needed relief.
6225 2018-11-02 18:33:59 question to the $oil bear

6235 2018-11-02 18:33:17 Being short oil looks like a crowded trade right now. I want to see a pop to $66 next week, then ride down to $58
6236 2018-11-02 18:33:14 Oil production has been going on in Lincolnshire since 1940. Why are people only now protesting when the UK could produce more of it's own oil rather than importing it?
6237 2018-11-02 18:33:07 P.S. Я не успела на посоветывание фильмов, но хотела добавить, что "С любовью, Саймон" шедевр в моём понимании. Вот. Он ЛГБТ, но если это не смущает, то потом обязательно к просмотру!

6246 2018-11-02 18:32:33 Yes, you are not satisfied with littering public lands with oil-gas-coal--now you want to cover the oceans with their pollution too. Maybe even Trump can't stomach you anymore! Let's all hope you are gone SOON!
6247 2018-11-02 18:32:32 What's your take regarding oil and gas exploration
6248 2018-11-02 18:32:24 It's just the oil smell without the drying tendencies of the wood fibers. I might want to look up how much cedar is used to make a bottle of the oil. The trees that appear to bleed kind of freak me out. Furniture made from that would bleed on hot days

Try some cumin oil then. Snake oil salesmen who prey on the ill should be tarred and feathered.
6251 2018-11-02 18:32:12 Sorry I got a little nasty, I was stoked to find Wyss, right after my Billionaire Challenge tweets. Been in Bakken for expat project, capturing 15 MMSCFD more of flare gas..gas the oil guys would burn if they could..peace.
6252 2018-11-02 18:32:08 Perhaps 0.1% of Americans understand how much their living standards have benefited from the Bretton Woods system and the petrodollar. When oil is traded in euros or rinminbi, US living standards will decline by 20+%.
6253 2018-11-02 18:31:47 Hickenlooper worries that gas and oil "production" is 15 to 20% of Colorado's economy? Better not run for President with facts that overwhelmingly wrong Hick! #VoteYeson112! #oillobbymoney
6254 2018-11-02 18:31:43 Zimbabwe finds oil, now it's time to grow up, there is no such things as prophet's
6255 2018-11-02 18:31:36 One of my friends had her first baby the other day..her labor and delivery was SO horrific that it involved olive oil in her vagina, burst blood vessels in eyes, a c-section and a woman walking around with a still born baby..so yeah..Black Doulas/Midwives matter..
6256 2018-11-02 18:31:35 Dang just had to go nuclear on a feeking motorcycle oil filter.

6262 2018-11-02 18:30:37 The current #oil exports at around 1.5 million barrels per day, which means regardless of any waivers, another 500,000 will be cut from exports.

6269 2018-11-02 18:29:30 The next bottle is the exact opposite, one oil only, simple straightforward cedarwood oil. I didn't get that one for a while because cedar as sawdust is something I found stifling. Not too much but too dry for me. The oil smells better than I expected
6270 2018-11-02 18:29:28 No one has successfully predicted oil price in all my years of looking at the markets. Dangote Refinery is 2020 at best, 2021 project. You cannot base your economic strategy on the success of one man, what’s the role of government then

6273 2018-11-02 18:29:23 this vapour oil is making me feel high
6274 2018-11-02 18:29:17 นึกถึงตอนเรียน ทำขี้ผึ้ง แยก water phase กับ oil phase อย่างดีแล้วเบลอๆเลยจับแม่งผสมกันเลย สรุปแยกชั้นจ้า ออกจากห้องสอบพึ่งคิดได้ว่าลืมใส่ emulsifier คือ...อิโง่ววววว

6277 2018-11-02 18:28:52 i accidentally splashed hot oil on my hand and now im in pain
6278 2018-11-02 18:28:40 Would like to see it targeted more to headwater streams, AMD issues, land reclamation, and old oil and gas drilling sites.
6279 2018-11-02 18:28:35 If you are jobless, your country can offer you a job! There nothing for you in Cameroon! The oil $ that those people are fighting for belongs to Cameroon!!

6281 2018-11-02 18:28:23 LEVERAGING EXTRATERRITORIAL SANCTIONS: The Trump administration grants India and seven other nations six-month waivers from the new US oil sanctions against Iran. In return, Pompeo says, the US has wrested major concessions from these countries. He didn't specify the concessions.
6282 2018-11-02 18:28:04 1 tsp coconut oil gives my coffee a smooth finish
6283 2018-11-02 18:27:59 Venezuela is a dictatorship. and we've sanctioned them so they cant sell their oil.
6284 2018-11-02 18:27:54 Wrong again, sweetheart. 
We are in this situation because for the last 20 years, the govt didn't plan for another oil crash; they didn't maintain what they should have, and lied to voters about balancing the budget. They didn't balance the budget. Now we are in cleanup mode.
6285 2018-11-02 18:27:52 Oil plus aguma are all but silly stunts to divert your attention from focusing on the QB matter. They don't want you to find out that there is no difference between zanupf and QB. It's the same fish
6286 2018-11-02 18:27:45 Pompeo: Iran will have zero oil revenue to spend on any of these things. Let me say that again. Zero. One hundred percent of the revenue that Iran receives from the sale of crude oil will be held in foreign accounts. #OOTT

6289 2018-11-02 18:27:35 I love robotic oil poffins~!
6290 2018-11-02 18:27:32 No amount of spin-doctoring or somersault can save the embarrassment from the ill-advised press conference on "oil discovery"! Months ago he announced a deal where another low key SA company (without even a website) would make fuel from coal in Zim.
6291 2018-11-02 18:27:31 Well...see there are different soil types...oh nevermind
6292 2018-11-02 18:27:31 Yes, the carbon tax will absolutely go up, every year, and so will your rebate. For the love of God, do some basic research about what it is and how it operates. Don't fall for right-wing lies. The entire movement is in bed with Big Oil.
6293 2018-11-02 18:27:28 Therein lays the conundrum Lisa.

None are as blind as those who WILL NOT see.

How does $25 dollar oil in a $75 market sound to you, amidst all the din of virtue fighting and social confusion?
6294 2018-11-02 18:27:22 So glad we dont have to deal with oil money.

6297 2018-11-02 18:27:06 Daymond: Kevin you spent how much on a bottle of olive oil?
Kevin: Yes and I would do it again!
6298 2018-11-02 18:26:58 indianapolis lucas oil stadium
6299 2018-11-02 18:26:51 The USA bullying Iran, because can't run Iran's foreign policy and sell arms for oil. that is why also intimidate the other nations if do business with Iran.
6300 2018-11-02 18:26:50 So over the years, do you occasionally re-inflate such footballs? Oil them so they don't crack? Curious what kind of maintenance goes into things like this!
6301 2018-11-02 18:26:50 The U.S. has agreed to let eight countries — including Japan, India and South Korea — keep buying Iranian oil after it reimposes sanctions on the OPEC producer on Nov. 5, a senior administration official said.
6302 2018-11-02 18:26:46 I somewhat see influencer marketing as snake oil salesmanship.
6303 2018-11-02 18:26:39 About the oil? 
6304 2018-11-02 18:26:38 Got bitten by ants on lips while applying almond oil. Ya allah what kind of zulm is this 
6305 2018-11-02 18:26:38 I'm literally giving out samples of basically olive oil and bread today.I don't imagine I'll be very busy
6306 2018-11-02 18:26:36 That's quite a blend of oils. Some of the terminology in the ingredients list was strange to me. For example ylang ylang oil extra. Extra what? Virgin like olive oil perhaps. Also chamomile Roman instead of Roman chamomile. That one is more of a nitpicking perhaps.

6308 2018-11-02 18:26:11 Particularly because most of the oil and gas industry is owned by American's.

You take their money, their oil.                     You are a terrible human
6310 2018-11-02 18:26:06 Central Bank Governor Hammati: #Iran's Foreign Exchange reserves reached good levels; #US failed to totally sanction Iran's #oil industry or reduce its exports to zero.
6311 2018-11-02 18:26:06 @FDASpox I think , as soon as the FDA , figures out how to line their pockets with money from people needing pain relief from CBD oil products , they will approve it..the FDA I'd no different than any other government agency. The people in the U.S. know this..
6312 2018-11-02 18:26:03 As legit as Alex Jones, go drink some Kool aide, oil your guns, put on your foil cap.  Banal
6313 2018-11-02 18:26:03 @PowerLunch @MelissaLeeCNBC @JackieDeAngelis Once the #USmidterms are over #Trump will be less concern about #oil/#wti/#brent prices & renew his focus on #Iran sanctions instead
6314 2018-11-02 18:26:02 Idk if you pernah cuba ni, but try AHA BHA mask, ataupun tea tree oil je. Based on what I see, ni mcm fungal acne. Susah nak hilang, tak sama macam bacterial acne. I used to have it too! But try lah okay.
6315 2018-11-02 18:25:48 Does it contain palm oil?
6316 2018-11-02 18:25:47 America needs to maintain the position where we are no longer dependent on FOREIGN OIL!  Keep all that money we were spending in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia right here at home!!! #AmericaFIRST
6317 2018-11-02 18:25:40 Fall date idea: getting your oil changed 
6318 2018-11-02 18:25:39 If crude oil is down 3%, then petrol and diesel should be also down by atleast 3%. But why it's not happening??. Is the formula of pricing fuel similar to duckworth Lewis formula in cricket, none understands it clearly ,yet used all the time. @BJP4India @dpradhanbjp
6319 2018-11-02 18:25:25 Sometimes life hits us harder than expected. I have lost count of how many times I have had to struggle to stand up, just to get hit again. I'm at the bottom and the wall is covered with grease and oil. But I keep trying to climb. #depression #life #darkness #feelings
6320 2018-11-02 18:25:25 I’ve always told Devil that his state and surrounding should really be the ones making the key decisions.

In flight expense usually refer to food/drink flight attendants ect.

6325 2018-11-02 18:24:48 football hasn't been the same ever since the oil rich people took interest in it. scandals upon scandals
6326 2018-11-02 18:24:46 They are running it. Freed for an AWOL. Obama is either dumb, or anti American aiding the enemy. Hard to know!? Or addicted to his legacy seeing self as ruler of the peaceful world. How crazy is that ego?! : Iran, & sweet whispers to Russian ears & Soros & Venezuela  oil maybe?!
6327 2018-11-02 18:24:40 Stfu... go back to school and learn what democracy is and how most actual democracies use proportional representation that reflects wishes of entire population rather than narrow interests of oil industry backed liberal and conservative parties.
6328 2018-11-02 18:24:40 As a result of the Don's intemperate actions against Iran, WTI Crude oil prices moved from <$50.00 per barrel to over $60.00 per barrel today.  Let him know u dont appreciate that, Vote Democrat on Tuesday.
6329 2018-11-02 18:24:23 This is why we really should just take their oil from them.
6330 2018-11-02 18:24:21 I really need a oil change I just hate paying for stuff for my car
6331 2018-11-02 18:24:20 I hate a girl that acts like she’s in the car scene for attention babyyyy you can’t even change a tire or your oil wtf lol
6332 2018-11-02 18:24:15 Virtually staying awake the whole night , getting up at 0330ish, Ganga Snaanam (oil bath), Namaskarams to parents, elders. Receiving new clothes, eating Diwali lehiyam, sweets, mixture,bursting crackers.
6333 2018-11-02 18:24:12 (1/3) 487 oil rigs running in Permian.  If you assume 1 well spud per month and 120 acre spacing (8 wells per 960 acres), then you develop 701,280 acres per year assuming single zone.
6334 2018-11-02 18:24:08 Kneeling raises awareness of the inequities that impact millions of lives

What doesn't make sense to me is how my freedom ended up in places like Afghanistan and Iraq

It seems more likely that what is in Iraq and Afghanistan is oil, and kids are being sent to die for it
6335 2018-11-02 18:24:03 Just drank some CBD oil for my anxieties (brexistential dread) - I feel a changed man...not for the better.
6336 2018-11-02 18:23:59 It's odd how the right wing Xians are perfectly OK with Muslims, even if they've horrifically tortured and murdered someone, as long as they're rich Saudi billionaire sheikhs dripping with oil.
6337 2018-11-02 18:23:55 Not together, but here are some things I've put in-either for taste or thanks to a diet recommendation to decrease sugar and increase healthy fat.

- hot cocoa
- tsp butter
- tsp coconut oil
- cinnamon 
- heavy whipping cream
6338 2018-11-02 18:23:51 there's probably a ton of them. Depending on which brush you use for which types of painting, you take care of them differently. The brushes I use for watercolor need a different type of care of for example oil brushes. Those need a lot of care because oil can damage quicker >
6339 2018-11-02 18:23:48 Went to jiffy lube to get a oil change this morning the Beamer drivin like a new car now 
6340 2018-11-02 18:23:48 So far CBD oil just makes me mildly sleepy.
6341 2018-11-02 18:23:43 Totally get where you're coming from! Authenticity and social media can be like oil and vinegar. We're just grateful to have captured this slice of Nicolle's life while it was happening  Appreciate you sharing your take on it Kris.
6342 2018-11-02 18:23:39 If Iran's oil reserves were cutoff from the other countries,  oil prices would skyrocket.  This would please american producers but cause economic hardship for all Americans.
6343 2018-11-02 18:23:38 Anything to sell her snake oil.
6344 2018-11-02 18:23:32 Oil down 11% last 2-3 weeks.
Could start to show up at the pump next week.
6345 2018-11-02 18:23:25 My dad puts in Butter. Organic Irish butter. And coconut oil. He’s weird but I still love him.
6346 2018-11-02 18:23:19 ((I thought I heard that, but I couldn’t be sure; associating Activision with charity is like associating motor oil to cereal.
((I mean... I know it’s just the base game, but still...))
6347 2018-11-02 18:23:19 I don't see any inherent value in video games. So, why do guys my age play them all the time? 

Go learn how to change the oil in your car!
6348 2018-11-02 18:23:17 I have this fantasy that the @SamSeder crew kidnaps Dennis Miller and you take his place. 
I also have this fantasy involving Ilana Glazer and a quart of olive oil, but that's another story.
6349 2018-11-02 18:23:16 Came to get an oil change on my truck and this dude keeps asking me the wrong questions 
6350 2018-11-02 18:22:59 Martha Burger is trash. Just another move to make sure oil and gas controls everything in this state
6351 2018-11-02 18:22:57 Scam. No one would even trust he has the oil to back it up 1 to 1. Centralized point of failure.
6352 2018-11-02 18:22:44 Kkkkkk.. My sister that's idiotic for someone to announce the discovery of oil in Mzarabani?Can that be possible in a land locked country. Zvasiyanei ne  discovery of diesel gushing from a stone. That's utter rubbish.
6353 2018-11-02 18:22:41 What people don’t know re’ #UJO BP actually flowed oil at #Biscathorpe in 1987 when oil was $10 a barrel. They drilled into the crest. Now they’re drilling into sweet spot etc Mucho oil to play for.
6354 2018-11-02 18:22:40 I like taking baths with Epson salt and coconut oil & Teatree, lavender and peppermint essential oil‘s. I’m a  so I avoided anabiotic‘s until I know for sure.
6355 2018-11-02 18:22:39 @realDonaldTrump WOW Donny, in three days you will put sanctions on Iran. Will there be a rise in gasoline prices? Will it be like the seventies when there was an oil embargo and the price of a barrel of oil triples? That would help Russia right? The stock market will drop Mon.
6356 2018-11-02 18:22:35 The biggest chancers in all this are the investigative journalists who’ve taken 10 years and a shed load of money to work out that all may not be quite right with the Oil lads.
6357 2018-11-02 18:22:31 i want something with lots of carbs, oil, garlic, and cheese 
6358 2018-11-02 18:22:27 Funny, they are actually "Standing" in the pic 
6359 2018-11-02 18:22:21 I hate waiting at the mechanic shop for oil changes 
6360 2018-11-02 18:22:15 i’m going to need more information on this oil situation
6361 2018-11-02 18:22:12 Another day, another corrupt and possibly criminal act by a Trump cabinet member or crony. 
WH concerned Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke violated federal rules 
Zinke’s Montana land deal with oil services firm executive is under scrutiny for possible criminal investigation. (WAPO)
6362 2018-11-02 18:22:09 I tried making pancakes... first I burned myself with hot oil and then I dropped oil on the stove plate and it caught fire idk what gives me the thought but maybe I should stop cooking
6363 2018-11-02 18:21:56 Hey pal, it’s unamerican to kiss fascist ass as a means to feathering your own nest.  Corporate farm welfare, guided age tax cut, generational deficits.  Retire! We need a senator who isn’t constantly wondering what happened to the whale oil futures.

6368 2018-11-02 18:21:23 Wah Modi Ji Wah first PM to travel US and bow them to give oil waiver
6369 2018-11-02 18:21:22 Seems to me analogous with Saudi attempt to cut prices to keep out competitors—but in oil we would not fixate on relative cost structures. simply a price vs volume choice.
6370 2018-11-02 18:21:20 Magaya kwava kuseri 2L cooking oil would  fetch upto $500 after repackaging it as "annointing oil".

6373 2018-11-02 18:20:50 They say sanctions are not real but don't want them removed, how can u not want smthn that doesn't exist to be removed.
They say illegitimate Gvnt but their MPs were sworn in by wat they claim is not legitimate.
They wish Oil will never be found in Zimbabwe.

6376 2018-11-02 18:20:26 how many oils are there? we have avocado oil, sesame oil, olive oil, peanut oil and sunflower oil at home why so many
6377 2018-11-02 18:20:21 We are to be thankful for our daily bread not worried about where our next meal is coming from, because just as God provided Manna for Israel in the wilderness and flour and oil for the Widow and her Son He will provide for us one day at a time.

6379 2018-11-02 18:20:03 @ntsikimazwai In all honesty though our hair doesn’t need all these expensive products. It just needs moisture i.e. water, deep conditioner & oil to moisturize. Can we stop buying all these ‘influencer advertised products’! Totally unnecessary.

6389 2018-11-02 18:19:09 Who cares? The Green Party is the radical left? If that’s the criteria then you sir are a radical self serving snake oil selling boot licking right wing nut job - oh wait you are. Head back to SC maybe you’ll find your spine or sone integrity on the way.

6403 2018-11-02 18:17:17 So why so many food banks in Aberdeen? All those low oil taxes you fought for must not be working. #idiot.

6407 2018-11-02 18:16:52 ADAM's the ultimate score, kid. No more grifts. No more scams. A monopoly on ADAM makes Standard Oil look like the Piggly Wiggly.
6408 2018-11-02 18:16:52 It takes twisted logic to justify sanctions on #Iran which has abided by the NPT & done more than most to thwart ISIS & Al Qaeda.

While cheerleading the same Saudi Oil Barons who sponsor the scum responsible for 9/11, bombed Yemen into famine & dismembered a journalist.
6409 2018-11-02 18:16:47 I really need to flush the radiator and change the oil & filter in my truck. Hopefully I'll be able to do that this weekend.
6410 2018-11-02 18:16:43 The Saudis know well the won't be any repurcussions. Oil is God in this world.
6411 2018-11-02 18:16:42 I wish I knew about CBD oil when I was in college. It would’ve helped out with so much stress lol
6412 2018-11-02 18:16:35 Dude I need an oil change like dead ass my light came on yesterday

6416 2018-11-02 18:16:28 Wow, you’re either delusional or a partisan snake oil salesman who will say anything to sell their lies.  I think you are the latter but you can be the former top or a combination thereof.

6421 2018-11-02 18:15:48 The fact is most of these ppl are so wealthy and insulated they can afford to advocate for anything and never be subjected to any consequences. They know what's best for everyone else, but they would never accept it themselves. They dont have to.
6422 2018-11-02 18:15:43 You are colleague of Iraninan leader to destroy Iran territory... To destroy Iran people and stealing oil...
6423 2018-11-02 18:15:42 BTW.. I said eye drops (I meant the dropper itself) but NOT IN YOUR EYES! Use the eye dropper to put the CBD oil under your tongue for 20 seconds, then swallow it.
It's gonna sting your eyes wickedly if you use it there...
Sorry for the confusion! Sheesh!

6426 2018-11-02 18:15:31 Yes, I do have #AppsurdCats who are rescues. Sphynx cats love human companionship. Their breed is described as monkey, dog & child. Think about that. They need a bath every week because no fur to absorb oil. They need human, blanket, heating pad windowsill Cat TV is a bonus.
6427 2018-11-02 18:15:25 Murdering millions of innocent people for oil + land, while allowing racist slavery to continue through corrupt police activity + privatized prisons. Limiting personal sovereignty with unjust laws + forced labor. There is only 1 party, they are all equally responsible, as are we

6439 2018-11-02 18:13:17 Depending, it could be that you’re over moisturizing and blocking your pores. We naturally produce sebum, so sometimes the reactions between the products and natural oil can cause a blockage.
6440 2018-11-02 18:13:16 Not just British...Americans are equally responsible for this Oil game...All for the fuckin oil...America & Britain together, must have massacred more number of people that the actual number of natural deaths this world has ever seen
6441 2018-11-02 18:13:04 Rothschild their paper funny money has created debts that can’t be paid off. This means spending is lower so they aren’t gaining so they’re switching tact. BRICS system will finish of the Dollar who’re all but bankrupt especially now China won’t buy US oil.

6443 2018-11-02 18:13:02 It was the british led europeans, with the help of their puppet, carter, who perpetrated the “revolution” (coup) of 79.

6467 2018-11-02 18:11:20 My face been so bad since I stopped using that oil 
6468 2018-11-02 18:11:19 The US promises to extend Iran to sanctions that were in force prior to the conclusion of the nuclear system with Tehran. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo assured that eight countries can temporarily import Iranian oil, despite the embargo on its export.

6473 2018-11-02 18:11:05 They have found ways to get around the sanctions. They have sold millions of barrels of oil to China who is reselling it. Trade is being done with rubles and yuan...with every country that is sanctioned...the dollar is not involved anymore.  More dangerous for our economy

I don’t know how else to put it but I have struggled with constant anxiety since I was so young & didn’t realize how constantly on edge I was until now.. is this how normal people feel?
6495 2018-11-02 18:08:47 If you moisturize daily, it could be too much oil... what I learned is to just minimize what I already do. If you deep condition after every wash try conditioning every other wash day, if you moisturize daily, try twice a week. It all depends on your hair tbh

6498 2018-11-02 18:08:41 Most people understand the economy not only for the rich but for the middle class. Natural Gas price set to quadruple this winter. Heating oil at an all time high. Food prices rising faster than ever before. Tax breaks taken away. For most of us, the economy has tanked.

6500 2018-11-02 18:08:32 Categorising fracking under "Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects" is a misnomer. It's usually reserved for airports, railways and roads, something entire populations benefit from, not just a select group of oil CEOs.

6553 2018-11-02 18:01:38 Insurance would be great, BUT last time it was used,  (Athabasca Oil Sands) it cost Lloyd's $600MM. Who is going to underwrite this debacle.  Especially knowing that every piece of the estimate has been lowballed to match funding. Bet the 50-50 case is $100MM over budget.
6554 2018-11-02 18:01:35 Oh, and the money from oil was covered by Infantino and Platini.
6555 2018-11-02 18:01:32 The outlook 4 oil prices is put at $74 on the avg in 2019, at this level we will have sufficient war chest to keep the rate stable below your projected N400. And if our production edges up and dangote refinery comes on board, the maths favors a stable ngn at an acceptable level

6558 2018-11-02 18:01:24 $CAT has a new nice business with the oil industry.  Exxon & Chevron reported great earnings so plenty of money to invest in production.
6559 2018-11-02 18:01:24 No , stop the censorship on ps4 or vanish from the market. You are self destructing . The anger is growing and you ignoring us is just gonna put oil on the fire. You should really adress this and at least make a public statement about it
6560 2018-11-02 18:01:21 Cruz is a carpet bagger who moved to Texas to improve his political chances. The only "real" Texans he knows are oil company executives. Outside if them, he's as well liked as a porcupine.
6561 2018-11-02 18:01:21 My only fear is wherever there is oil in War seems to follow...
6562 2018-11-02 18:01:02 I have to get my oil changed and I hate doing that

6571 2018-11-02 18:00:18 It appears that increased crude oil production has temporarily lessened pressure on Saudi Arabia's leadership regarding the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

6581 2018-11-02 17:59:38 Africa has more untapped natural resources than any other continent - timber, oil, diamonds, metal, you fucking name it. But, African countries can’t produce an economy to match the crappiest European country. Africa was better off under colonialism

6584 2018-11-02 17:59:19 Anyone with an ounce of acumen shouldn't be surprised with the leaks, it's always been clear that the oil money was running through everything these clubs have ever achieved in the last decade.

6592 2018-11-02 17:58:28 @SecPompeo India is buying Russian military equipment & oil from Iran- Why are they being exempted from sanctions ? - This is hogwash, we have no consistency. Besides thousands of american jobs are being taken by India here thru work visas you are issuing.

6594 2018-11-02 17:58:22 Oh no cabbage can be sexy!!! So get some pointed cabbage, slice, dice & boil. When done, drain. In a pan, a glug of olive oil & heat up. Fry the cabbage with a good pinch of smoked salt, cracked pepper & Chipotle chillie & a squeeze of lemon. Stir. Serve on own or as a side.

6602 2018-11-02 17:57:37 I will invest the money in a coconut oil project
6603 2018-11-02 17:57:34 Some products are not good for some skins. I used the tea trea oil or something a few years ago and I literally had to throw it away. The brightening serum and the soap and the stretch mark cream worked wonders
6604 2018-11-02 17:57:29 let them buy it we need some oil money influence
6605 2018-11-02 17:57:26 "Eight nations are set to get waivers from the U.S. allowing them to continue buying oil from Iran after U.S. sanctions are reimposed."

That countries need waivers to buy oil shows the world runs under a unipolar U.S. empire with very little national sovereignty. This won't last
6606 2018-11-02 17:57:23 Football Index bollocks up the G&A dividend payouts and Man City and PSG are illegally flaunting FFP rules with billions in oil money.

Also, water is wet.
6607 2018-11-02 17:57:18 In India, its better to have stock of diesel or gasoline as an investment rather a crude oil

6610 2018-11-02 17:57:12 These are strange bed fellows because of the Saudi Oil and interests. Despite 9/11 and ALMOST ALL bomb plots coming from Saudi nationals in one way or another, the US treats it as the MPN (Most Preferred Nation). It always comes with a price. No?
6611 2018-11-02 17:56:50 Classic263 (formerly Spot FM) is still insisting there is oil in Muzarabani...

6613 2018-11-02 17:56:30 #RiverFlowsNorth “Definitely,” I stated. That had already been my plan. We needed more water for the radiator and oil was a must – if we could help it.

6626 2018-11-02 17:55:20 Congratulations Zim! but be suspicious of new friends of convenience now that you've got oil.
6627 2018-11-02 17:55:14 Pls who is the person, he or she has blocked me
6628 2018-11-02 17:55:11 No. The recent rise is oil price is not particularly due to fundamentals. The original RU tax threshold was $30. $45 is about right. Some US fracking is now at $46.
6629 2018-11-02 17:55:06 Hope they tack the ownership from them oil merchants
6630 2018-11-02 17:55:06 @IcelandFoods I think it's great that you're not selling your own branded products with palm oil anymore, but will you stop selling palm oil products as a whole in the future? And look for alternatives?
6631 2018-11-02 17:54:53 "This specific way to hustle doesn't work for me so it can't possibly work for you" type of mentality is not conducive at all to being someone who publicly gives advice to others on a regular basis.. unless you're selling social media snake oil.

6632 2018-11-02 17:54:50 Lol no oil
6633 2018-11-02 17:54:50 Bulletproof = high in good fat.  Bulletproof coffee is coffee with butter or coconut oil.  Weird to apply that to cereal, I assume this is done ironically, bc it's normally part of a carb-avoiding diet like keto.

You can remember your history without being putting oil on fire. Nothing can get better this way
6639 2018-11-02 17:54:40 ...that you broadcast live and put my face on the corner of the screen live on television and say this is the man who said we have oil on this place, he also said this entire generation might not benefit from it buh our children will

6642 2018-11-02 17:54:27 Can’t remember who it was that was suffering from gout, but you can drink Lemongrass essential oil in your water to flush it out and as a preventative measure, just make sure it’s in a glass or stainless steel cup.

6651 2018-11-02 17:52:54 I don't understand why we bother ourselves with oil deposits that might not actually be there. We have Lithium which is used in Electric Vehicles. In 10 years majority of new cars will be fully electric. This is the new clean oil we should be celebrating. Not this dirty oil.

6656 2018-11-02 17:52:30 1631 ensures no accountability the money will be spent appropriately. And anyone who doesn't expect this additional tax to trickle down to us is a fool. The big bad wolf oil companies will feel nothing.
6657 2018-11-02 17:52:28 getting an oil change and inspection and the wait is like an hour long 
6658 2018-11-02 17:52:24 Osea que le debemos los superávit gemelos a la Sociedad Rural? Y la baja del desempleo fue gente que pasó a manufacturar commodities? Los precios de manufacturas caen en el extranjero por la revolución energética norteamericana del shale oil 2010.

6660 2018-11-02 17:52:15  we needed the inspection as we heard grinding sound so aside from oil change had to bring it in ugh.
6661 2018-11-02 17:52:14 At least, they have heating oil..., and they don't need $$$ to buy food from neighbors.
6662 2018-11-02 17:52:12 I don’t understand why anyone would pay to get their oil changed when it’s literally so easy to do it yourself

6664 2018-11-02 17:52:00 But Jim, the pres & his cabinet continue to loosen standards for pollution, allow coal tailings to be dumped in streams & have already bulldozed Indian sites. Sage Grouse are in danger when their numbers had been increasing. Oil rigs and the roads to them are the danger.

Cut it up with a bone saw and hide the parts in oil drums probably.

6666 2018-11-02 17:51:53 #green energy is not good enough to compete against real #energy and that is why #marketing numbers are used instead of engineering terms. 

A 1000Mw solar or wind power plant is mythical, nowhere near a 1000Mw nameplate gas, oil, coal or nuclear plant.

It’s given huge handicaps
6667 2018-11-02 17:51:50 It is very crazy I seen worst stuff on IG and I don't know why people are hateing I female showing there feet or oil on there feet
6668 2018-11-02 17:51:40 This cannot be ignored.  Trump is trying to forget it ever happened...the reason? Saudi's are pumping oil like crazy before the midterms...to keep a false "LOW" on gas prices...just wait until after the midterms...oil will go sky high.
6669 2018-11-02 17:51:32 The United States has told Iraq that it will be allowed to keep importing crucial gas, energy supplies and food items from Iran after Washington reimposes sanctions on Tehran's oil sector, three Iraqi officials said on Friday.

6674 2018-11-02 17:50:59 I made a big hit on the lunch bump. I think now is a good time to get the E Oil.
6675 2018-11-02 17:50:58 @KellyannePolls Why is India being exempted from Iran sanctions ? - They are buying oil from Iran & military equip from Russia both violations of US law. What are we getting from them ? - thousands of low wage workers taking american jobs !
6676 2018-11-02 17:50:38 They already have, in any of the Oil Wars you could find examples
6677 2018-11-02 17:50:36 My version is super easy because I am very lazy. Brown 6 Toulouse sausages & 4 rashers of bacon in oil, remove from the pan & chop up, then brown 1 chopped onion in the meaty fat, then add the chopped meat with a squirt each of tomato & garlic purée...
6678 2018-11-02 17:50:34 They came did some investigative tests bcz the water there was undrinkable and confirmed that there is no oil, but @prmakandiwa only said there is oil he said I will show the exact place to drill and tell you the number of metres to drill buh on one condition 1/2

6721 2018-11-03 23:55:34 Piss poor performance. Piss poor. If @realDonaldTrump 's goal was to make Saudi Arabia the top dog in SWA and able to control the crude oil market, their actions against Iran is a first step to destroy your only leverage.
6722 2018-11-03 23:54:47 We're going to see so much more of this since this illegitimate president basically gave the oil & other industries license to poison in the interest of making a buck.  As usual, many of the affected rural people are trump voters.  Such a tragedy...Vote Dem.

6729 2018-11-03 23:53:41 That report has been discounted even by the agency that generated it.  Will it take a lot of time and money to clean it up?  Yes, but all oil sands producers are already investing in tech to clean up the ponds.

6731 2018-11-03 23:53:38 Seems like some are more robust than others but it also depends on *how* one uses bread in its culinary traditions. To merely bring in carbs (contemporary sandwich style?), or soaking it in olive oil & feta as Greeks do? To carry jamón as the Spanish? To accompany a rich paté?

6736 2018-11-03 23:53:05 Nice of him to let the world know exactly what Iran's plans are. Nothing will come of it though. Oil will stay below $100 per barrel, at worst. Sorry Iran! New government coming your way!!

6751 2018-11-03 23:50:00 Out of pocket more than before tariffs. Just spent 50% more than last year at this time for our annual Italian fall feast on imported cheese, meats & olive oil. Enjoy.
6752 2018-11-03 23:49:55 The US is doing the best thing we can do by re-imposing sanctions on Iran after @BarackObama pounded the pooch. We do not need to engage in yet another Islamic conflict. We screw it up worse every single time we do. Time for oil rich regional powers to start stepping up.
6753 2018-11-03 23:49:54 I unequivocally tell my almost 5yo that human beings don’t need: prisons, police, and oil. If his generation has a future at all, they need to envision life without these destroyers of humanity. Let your children dream, because soon they will have to fight.

6756 2018-11-03 23:49:20 True, but Hitler didn't fuck up the east, his generals, especially Guderian did, Hitler was a shitty strategist in all ways but one, economics - it was a war for oil, he wanted to push caucus oil fields first, but the generals felt they could do Moscow, Stalingrad, etc.

6765 2018-11-03 23:48:27 We wont have an oil spill. No chance. Sure you do get 40' waves out there but that never stopped us in the past. And if we did have a serious leak we couldn't stop. Who would know anyway because it would disperse right around the globe. No drama. The whales love the stuff #auspol
6766 2018-11-03 23:48:26 You are right.  Our increased taxes help the revenue line for sure.  As for diversification, you are right again. Nice seeing oil and gas families now working at jobs paying 50-75% that what they were making.  Keep drinking the NDP Koolaid

6783 2018-11-03 23:46:34 What most external critics don’t comprehend (and doubtful they ever  will) about Canada’s oil & gas industry is the lost opportunity, the unrealized potential ... and the hundreds of billions in lost GDP ... directly attributable to terribly misguided @liberal_party policy
6784 2018-11-03 23:46:20 This is beautiful
Let me humbly draw your attention to the plight of the Teaching Hospital Oghara, the only Teaching Hospital in the oil rich Delta State . It's in decrepit state. No adequate funding and its IGR is gross inadequate to cater for its numerous needs

6791 2018-11-03 23:45:27 No. It’s because of oil money. If they admit climate change origins they’ll have to give up oil money.
6792 2018-11-03 23:45:19 The rightful owners of the oil and gas. WWI had deprived them of the oil and gas. Now they have regained the power to reclaim their assets!
6793 2018-11-03 23:44:26 bearish for oil?
6794 2018-11-03 23:44:21 we got burned all the time. unfortunately it was part of the job. I’ve had steam burns, quesadilla press burns, hot oil burns. my tattoo on my wrist bubbled up after a steam burn twice. so yeah lol
6795 2018-11-03 23:44:18 I can still smell the damn gas, oil, and wood from cutting and stacking logs this morning.
6796 2018-11-03 23:44:18 All I did was go kickboxing, take my daughter to get her eyebrows waxed and bought some frankincense oil and vitamin B. Got castor oil too. Now talking my daughter through her geometry homework.
6797 2018-11-03 23:44:16 Only the sound of crickets coming out of the White House...but the Saudi's did what Trump wanted and pumped a lot of oil so that prices of oil would go down and gasoline would be cheap before the midterms.  Payback.
6798 2018-11-03 23:44:14 Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia too. Russia has nothing but oil. They are marauders/invaders who need everything.
6799 2018-11-03 23:44:11 Yup, and I was told at current production rates, the world would be out of oil by 2020.  I am beginning to think it was all political bs.
6800 2018-11-03 23:43:54 I done sleep wake up sef
6801 2018-11-03 23:43:42 Listen! They got the oil on their hands 
6802 2018-11-03 23:43:35 the day donghan starts using oil blotting paper is the day imgoing to be so sososo so sad  dont do it bro 
6803 2018-11-03 23:43:34 So, Exxon says that global warming is the governments fault, because the government doesn't have enough laws and regulations on carbon emmissions???

That's what the oil lobby keeps telling Congress, right????
Oil companies are demanding more laws and regs????

6804 2018-11-03 23:43:29 In fact I’m going to put a hair oil treatment on tonight and pray for a miracle
6805 2018-11-03 23:43:25 Oh I meant oil change .. I’m waiting next year for that
6806 2018-11-03 23:43:18 why you gave exception to countries to buy oil from mullas...?you want them to get more money? why?
 you have to think twice! this regime will go but people of iran will deal with American people! we will remember your help or NOT..;

6807 2018-11-03 23:43:05 It is a old news. China stopped to buy Us oil weeks ago.
6808 2018-11-03 23:42:59 make your own scrub out if brown sugar (exfoliate), lemon (toner), and honey (moisturizer). follow up with some vitamin E oil... mannnn 
6809 2018-11-03 23:42:31 Exactly when oil prices declined. It's the free market. Bitimen is more expensive to produce.
6810 2018-11-03 23:42:28 It would be good if a way could be found to keep all that oil in the ground though.

6812 2018-11-03 23:42:09 But now compared to a trump speech he sounds like a real snake oil salesman
6813 2018-11-03 23:42:06 Contains 2% or less of the following: Cellulose from Bamboo, Methylcellulose, Potato Starch, Natural Flavor, Maltodextrin, Yeast Extract, Salt, Sunflower Oil, Vegetable Glycerin, Dried Yeast, Gum Arabic, Citrus Extract (to protect quality), Ascorbic Acid (to maintain color),
6814 2018-11-03 23:42:05 Well all I have to do is buy the oil .. and my folks will do it for me for $50 if that
6815 2018-11-03 23:41:53 I should design manly cologne options ... pistol oil, diesel smoke, 2-stroke exhaust, motor grease...

B) #Oilers string of 1st overall selections
6820 2018-11-03 23:41:33 Use tea tree oil. Wood plugs are also amazing those don’t smell
6821 2018-11-03 23:41:30 Massage a few drops of coconut oil around the eyes to get rid off dark circles.
6822 2018-11-03 23:41:01 Oil money. And no one will do anything about it...

6826 2018-11-03 23:40:31 I’m convinced it’s mayo with a splash of olive oil.
6827 2018-11-03 23:40:30 ?????
6828 2018-11-03 23:40:27 Consensus is not clear. It seems to me that money is made on both sides. Both sides have a conflict of interest. One side is creating taxes that don’t fix the problem. The other side is pro oil or sees this for what it is. Govts are broke. Can’t tax the sun
6829 2018-11-03 23:40:12 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
6830 2018-11-03 23:40:11 Because there's no monetary incentive to do so. Now, if there were oil in there, we'd already have moon colonies
6831 2018-11-03 23:40:11 Grandfather is the nuts and bolts of our family, he holds us all together.I watch as he cracks an egg in the pan,spitting as it hits the hot oil.Egg sandwitches have always been my favourite. My stomach gurgles as I watch the familiar morning routine unfold.

6835 2018-11-03 23:39:38 Finally a happy cat. Hes been pestering me all morning for something nice little tin just for him. Hard to ignore. If you try he taps on my leg. Gave him a tin of sardines and he is now licking his lips and paws in pleasure to get the last little bit of oil....
6836 2018-11-03 23:39:34 if the hype is correct,
the world will be saved on tuesday.

6837 2018-11-03 23:39:33 Something car owners should know:
The reason auto shops always tell you there's something else wrong with your car after an oil change is because they barely making any profit from oil changes alone. 
So next time they say you need an air filter, don't buy it.
6838 2018-11-03 23:39:30 That’s yr opinion m8..
Do me a favour, go & look at the shale oil plants, or the Athabaskan Tar Sands.
He’ll on Earth, as are the open cut coal mines in my country..

6841 2018-11-03 23:38:46 It's the coconut oil isn't it Trey
6842 2018-11-03 23:38:46 Have we put sanctions on Pakistan yet, or do we only care about human rights in Islamic countries that have oil?
6843 2018-11-03 23:38:44 Its a personal thing but soften onions, a small bit of garlic in olive oil. Add boiling water and stock . Season as you wish . I used salt pepper cumin and a teeny bit of worchester. Throw in spuds,  boil for 10 mins, then throw in cut up sausage & bacon for 20/25 mkns . Simples.
6844 2018-11-03 23:38:32 Firestone done had my car all damn day for A oil change and tire .. 10 am to 7pm . Oh you doing your job job .. Indeed
6845 2018-11-03 23:38:29 May this oil continually flow
6846 2018-11-03 23:38:22 If we pulled every dime out of CORPORATE welfare & if Big Business, Big Oil etc etc & the 1% paid their fair share of taxes, we would have far more than enough to provide for the needs of the people of this country for decades AND repair our infrastructure.

6848 2018-11-03 23:38:17 Thank you Stacey. I do take CBD and THC oil. But they don’t help much with the back pain. It does help with the face, foot and hand pain tho.
6849 2018-11-03 23:38:10 dyeing it/ironing it, helps loadss ud be surprised. Although u can still damage it u can add coconut oil to it and it helped me lots tll
6850 2018-11-03 23:37:46 I used to vote against all initiatives on principle, but the @gop no longer cares about governing, so we can't actually pass common sense laws without initiatives unfortunately. I supported 940 and the pollution tax, cause fuck big oil.
6851 2018-11-03 23:36:58 Well Michael got tired of asking about my oil finally and is changing it tomorrow 
6852 2018-11-03 23:36:52 Saudis n UAE invaded for oil and the Western ports. Money, its all about money

6857 2018-11-03 23:36:36 Black folks! Our liberty is in Africa! We let white ppl control and exploit the whole continent! Our while history, why not take it back? Oil gold diamonds gas is already there, bring our Western capital,tech and intelligence and lives the black lives that you want too!
6858 2018-11-03 23:36:21 Forget the oil, natural gas & commodities #Saudi possess, and how they can change the game rules by using the above, when yogurt hits the fan, it takes only ( one ) Fatwa from The Supreme Council of Saudi Scholars and its over, how do you think the red army was defeated ?
6859 2018-11-03 23:36:17 @DeSmogBlog Is it true that the wholesale price of oil must be about $100 a barrel to make tar sands profitable and the Cartels are over producing to force down the price to stop tar sand production?
6860 2018-11-03 23:36:14 Is the adoption of #cryptocurrencies into everyday life and potential phasing out of #FIAT going to play out in a similar way too that of the use of oil? A pipeline dream until it favours those stakeholders it's benefits most and in their terms? #blockchain #politics #bitcoin
6861 2018-11-03 23:35:50 I braised ours last night in oil, salt & pepper, red wine, apricot jelly and a can of Campbell’s Mushroom soup with Garlic. Then it’s in the crock low an slow. I’ll make Duck L’Orange tomorrow.

6868 2018-11-03 23:35:15 I started putting him on his stomach tho, he sleeps better than way. maybe he need some hair oil
6869 2018-11-03 23:35:14 He threw up the whole issue as bait for nitwit followers to have nonsense to vote for.  Congress can't change the constitution without an amendment either.  I'm laughing so hard over here.
6870 2018-11-03 23:34:58 When I feel an attack coming on, 4-7-8 breathing helps a lot. Slows your heart rate down. Breathe in for 4, hold for 7, let out for 8. Also, lavender and peppermint essential oil is great!
6871 2018-11-03 23:34:35 Yeah 
6872 2018-11-03 23:34:32 Cleaned the gutters, picked up the leaves (for the third time..), fixed a leaking fuel line on the leaf blower, changed the oil in the snowblower and moved it from the shed to the garage. You can thank me later for the impending blizzard.
6873 2018-11-03 23:34:31 Italian sub=ham, capicola, salami, provolone, shredded lettuce (not leaf), tomato & onion, with oil and red wine vinegar on Italian bread.
6874 2018-11-03 23:34:25 I used too much purple Fabuloso to mop the floor and put too many drops of peppermint oil in the diffuser and now I can see the future, levitate objects, communicate with animals, and sing the Queen of the Night aria perfectly. Ask me anything.
6875 2018-11-03 23:34:24 LOVE YOU OIL!!!!
6876 2018-11-03 23:34:22 #IranSanctions: If (e.g.) Total wish to buy Iranian oil, and that’s legal under French law, they’re welcome to do so... but they will never do business with anyone in the US again, and creating an SPV to do the actual trading won’t change that intent...
6877 2018-11-03 23:33:35 because Harper would not have uttered those words had the US not signed on. He knew it would mean giving away Canada oil/gas industry to the US for free, and yet nothing would improve with climate change. Harper was smart. Liberals are sacrificing Canada's future for nothing.
6878 2018-11-03 23:33:30 Beat duck breasts like they shot your dog, Marinade in BBQ Sauce, Horseradish, Balsamic Vinegar, and a bit of minced onion. Slice into strips, Bread and fry in oil on medium heat, then invite me for dinner.
6879 2018-11-03 23:33:28 Right? And isn’t America great again? And isn’t this the best economy in the history of the universe? And aren’t all (white) Americans working again bc coal/oil jobs? And don’t all world leaders trust or fear us (based on whether they’ve declared love for Trump or not)? And..etc.
6880 2018-11-03 23:33:18 Then he needs to stop with the non sense and excuses. Stop telling us how great it is when it isn't.  Be honest instead of a snake oil salesman.
6881 2018-11-03 23:33:08 I will vote for everyone of them if I could. Thses libs are HYPOCRITES! Why don't they publish list on politicians who take money from big pharma, lawyers lobbyists, evil corporations, oil companies, abortion providers, medical lobbyists, etc... they all want qiud pro quo.

6887 2018-11-03 23:32:31 Yep... better than fighting for oil or opium
6888 2018-11-03 23:32:26 Hardly. The United States is increasing fossil fuel production dramatically, we just recently became the world's leading oil producer and soon we will be unchallenged. I would think you would be pissing your panties about the extra CO2.

6892 2018-11-03 23:31:45 Thanks for reading! Jason and Dan spent months gathering official reports (including with a FOIA), interviewing workers and neighbors, and consulting with oil and gas experts-- then presented their findings AND how they found them to the public. Seems like journalism to me.
6893 2018-11-03 23:31:42 Could try CBD oil, suppose to help with sleep
6894 2018-11-03 23:31:39 えぇ…間に合わないじゃん。。
6895 2018-11-03 23:31:29 I hate watching replays of any running plays. The O line look like oil sludge. No energy at all. So dang sad.
6896 2018-11-03 23:31:23 Bet itd still be cheaper than burning oil to heat your house...
6897 2018-11-03 23:31:12 Norway made $131 billion last year for its sovereign wealth fund. Since it’s inception in 1996, the fund (largely generated from oil revenues) has raised over $1 trillion. How much did Scotland make from oil last year? Think about the possibilities!@theSNP
6898 2018-11-03 23:31:11 We shall see. There will be no EO on this. He threw that out as bait, which media flocked to. 
Congress likely will take it up which is the proper forum. Just deporting illegals regardless of having an anchor baby would solve 90% or more of it.
6899 2018-11-03 23:31:08 President Obama, however don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.

I’ve been using this spray since 1998. 
6902 2018-11-03 23:30:54 @pep boys  I came into the Cathedral City Store over an hour and half ago and the service department wasn’t busy. I asked for a simple oil change and when I tell you I’m still sitting here waiting... I am so annoyed w/ how slow these people at this pep boys is.

6922 2018-11-03 23:27:12 I did. The no voice is a scam by the oil companies. Time to actually get aggressive on climate change
6923 2018-11-03 23:27:09 Because the US has spent 70 years developing ties to Saudi Arabia. US business spent about a year, between the 2015 Iran deal and Trumps 2016 election putting together a few contracts. I think Boeing and an oil company or two got burned but they probably hadn't hired anyone yet.
6924 2018-11-03 23:27:02 Q from South Africa. I have an oil, serum & eye cream for my night routine. Which order should I put them on? 

Also the 60 second thing is amazing 
6925 2018-11-03 23:27:00 As I said previously, there are a myriad of factors that go into oil pricing. 

Geopolitical concerns surrounding Iran is but one. 

Trying to predict oil prices is like trying to predict long term interest rates. Your best bet is to wait and then look back.

6933 2018-11-03 23:26:06 If I break your heart na oil spillage I study this your love for freedom college.
6934 2018-11-03 23:26:06 I find grape seed oil works best. Waaaay better than olive oil in my opinion.
6935 2018-11-03 23:26:00 So an oil consortium is putting out propaganda in favor of Exxon. Shocking ... not!
6936 2018-11-03 23:25:52 Yeah I’m with Dave on this one, the lovely oily-ness of hummus only draws out the nothing-but-crappy-oil of pombears. Doesn’t stop me eating them of course, with or without an emergency
6937 2018-11-03 23:25:49 Double minors for head contact, 1 Flame and 1 Oil
6938 2018-11-03 23:25:32 Wow! My knees are looking like I didn’t lotion & baby oil up today & I sure enough did! 
6939 2018-11-03 23:25:28 I’m also happy because he set up an appointment for my car oil change  that’s true love

今日で撤収ですね
6942 2018-11-03 23:25:07 Yeah, it's a straight-up lie to say they support preexisting. These people are selling snake oil.
6943 2018-11-03 23:24:42 While you're at it... stop using canola oil in your products. It's a GMO, not a real food, and it makes me ill.
6944 2018-11-03 23:24:30 "Hi, I'm Luten Plunder of Polluter Oil company. Let me tell you about the evils of 'clean energy...'"
6945 2018-11-03 23:24:30 Some shoving and man handling results in 2 Flames get 2 mins and 1 Oil for 2.
6946 2018-11-03 23:24:17 Photos can tell more than words.. These are your soldiers who stole gold in Iraq. They are still stealing oil in Syria right now.. You see them as hero right??!!
6947 2018-11-03 23:23:58 Snake oil salesman! Buyers always available!
6948 2018-11-03 23:23:52 Injecting olive oil into his cheeks
6949 2018-11-03 23:23:35 This is my humble opinion and what happens next is anybody’s guess in crypto markets.  I’m more interested in the #blockchaintechnology and opportunities therein.  But you can bet your coins there are JR Analysts burning midnight oil researching all this stuff to build reports!
6950 2018-11-03 23:23:21 fpsってやつ？わたしには難しそうだな(っ´ω`c)
6951 2018-11-03 23:23:21 You don’t realize how to win until you have lost it all. Hard work pays off. Crypto isn’t easy. Time is money. I invest time into what I invest in. Plus I have the passion for it. I think you can respect that being passionate about oil recycling.
6952 2018-11-03 23:23:14 Naaa, just get some skunk oil that hunters all know about and poor it into the ventilation system.
6953 2018-11-03 23:23:05 Treated myself to new oil pastels~ fuckkkkkkkkk
6954 2018-11-03 23:23:03 Wicked. I also find Tumeric very good for swollen joints. Krill oil/gluc-chon/tumeric. That's my trifecta
6955 2018-11-03 23:22:53 I started with a vape cartridge but then switched to the sublingual oil
6956 2018-11-03 23:22:51 That’s bullshit. I work in the oil patch and it’s not even like that.
6957 2018-11-03 23:22:42 なんかLINE返ってこないのって僕に興味ないからだよねぇ？人選んで返信してるんよなぁ？と考えると眠れない。と思ってたらたまに返ってくるしなんなんだもう
6958 2018-11-03 23:22:27 We do not have companies falling over to invest right now so soon after the exit of RGM, this is what we have, pehaps if a substantial amount is found we will get an oil rush with major players
6959 2018-11-03 23:22:18 U vape or put under tongue??? I wanna switch to the oil I was just desperate and that’s all they had ;/
6960 2018-11-03 23:22:04 Tanning oil
6961 2018-11-03 23:21:59 I work as a service writer and people are always acting like I'm trying to screw them even when I give them large discounts. Especially oil changes when we have great prices on oil changes so much so that we almost lose money on them.
6962 2018-11-03 23:21:39 BR your Sage gift is being put to great use. 

That peppermint halo oil is working its magic on my sore muscles. 

I smell like Christmas
6963 2018-11-03 23:21:33  I don't have oil so I'm not sure but did you get it taking care of
6964 2018-11-03 23:21:29 i'd like to commission an oil painting of this
6965 2018-11-03 23:21:16 The case says he's a citizen because he was born here and he's under jurisdiction of the US because his parentsvwere not on a diplomatic mission - exactly as the 14th Amd stipulates. It's the highest law of the land, and no nincompoop's executive order can change it.
6966 2018-11-03 23:21:00 Last day to enter our Essential Oil Locket below! Please make sure you follow all the steps because many haven’t 
6967 2018-11-03 23:20:45 @StateDept It always affects the people.  Esp when you are allowing 8 other countries to buy Iran’s oil.
6968 2018-11-03 23:20:44 God didn’t intend for us to eat them. He meant only for us to use them for oil
6969 2018-11-03 23:20:40 I'm with the heads up crew, be it for an allergy or an intolerance. I've been told that soya oil in my medication or frying food should be fine for my tum, but my tum clearly hasn't read that page. Knowledge = less emergency loo trips
6970 2018-11-03 23:20:31 Cool. I’ve been using oil in my case. It’s super convenient for me

6974 2018-11-03 23:20:08 So i put tea tree oil on my spots when my skin’s a bit bad and i used some tonight for the first time in months and had a bad flashback to A-Level exams when my skin was really bad from the stress lol
6975 2018-11-03 23:19:49 Try Emu oil as well 
6976 2018-11-03 23:19:46 I just got a purple shampoo hopefully that helps & I usually use the “it’s a 10” leave in & an oil daily. My hair feels great I just forgot I was suppose to tone 
6977 2018-11-03 23:19:46 Self care: rubbing coconut oil on my arms where I've been picking *eye roll*
6978 2018-11-03 23:19:42 I had butter and olive oil presented together in one dish at lunch yesterday and was so happy
6979 2018-11-03 23:19:36 Okay MOOD i used to get asked if I wore makeup. I was like no my skin is clear it’s just drenched in oil 
6980 2018-11-03 23:19:33 Can’t believe I didn’t catch that!
6981 2018-11-03 23:19:20 I can smell the crude oil in my my clothes and I ain’t even stepped in the plant yet
6982 2018-11-03 23:19:15 Snake oil salesmanship. Standby for the diet books, supplements, apps, etc.
6983 2018-11-03 23:19:12 水(ウォーター)とは仲が悪いです。
6984 2018-11-03 23:19:09 Does anyone use CBD Oil? I have some questions.
6985 2018-11-03 23:18:47 Lol one that matches your skin type. I like to control the oil with powder and use a dewy spray
6986 2018-11-03 23:18:32 I was making cookies and when they were done I told my parents “So I decided to mix things up and instead of using vegetable oil, I used apple cider vinegar”. Their reaction did not disappoint.
6987 2018-11-03 23:18:29 What part of financial sanctions do you not understand?  The govt and and affiliated organizations is prohibited from purchasing ANYTHING through the banking system. This includes medicine, dialysis machines, and replacement parts for oil wells.  Are you for the sanctions or not?
6988 2018-11-03 23:18:27 They say are for enforcement, ok let's enforce.
Nearly 350,000 anchor babies a year ×2 parents. That's 700,000 deportable illegals. 
Oh no, we cant do that they say. Why not? 
It is the law and nothing says an anchor baby has to be raised here.
6989 2018-11-03 23:18:26 Poor liberal.... there is oil being produced on private land, which he can’t control and federal land. Oil and natural gas was down federally. There was a huge boom on private land.
6990 2018-11-03 23:18:25 United States with it's waver program showed that they can't possibly bring #iran oil export to zero. Global economy depends on it. Iran 1 #USA 0
6991 2018-11-03 23:18:05 12 seconds in!! 1-0 Oil  now that’s how to start a game!#Oilers
6992 2018-11-03 23:17:54 I agree. In fact, a little instability in the oil supply chain would raise prices and accelerate the switch away from fossil fuels, thereby increasing our national security.
6993 2018-11-03 23:17:39 Always oil!
6994 2018-11-03 23:17:02 I got two lippy sticks and a face cleanser from the bt21 collection. And for the vt x bts I got an oil to foam cleanser.

6996 2018-11-03 23:16:56 D accord avec vous, mais ce n est pas une raison pour le surtaxer.Perso je roule à l ethanol à 0.70€ à la pompe. Je comprend que les gens s enerve à 1,70€ le litre de gas oïl. Et si on reduisait plutôt le train de vie de l Etat pour equilibrer le budget.
6997 2018-11-03 23:16:54 circumventing the petro dollar is a no no! Same for Syria they were doing arms deals and oil deals directly with Russia that is what is really going on! But No worries $BTC gonna change EVERYTHING!
6998 2018-11-03 23:16:52 History shows the reverse is true. Big oil deliberately derailed clean energy technology at many stops along the way to now. Read my book @NaomiOreskes for some recent historical perspective.

7000 2018-11-03 23:16:38 The Department of Interior, which has led the way in cutting regulations, opened plans to lease 77 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico for oil and gas drilling.

7002 2018-11-03 23:16:23 Having the oil field and getting the oil out are two different things. Has The US made any money selling Iraqi oil?
7003 2018-11-03 23:16:21 Banks, big foreign banks attract FDI, lead big ticket transactions in Oil & gas, Telco, manufacturing, aviation etc,
If none of the listed, then what were they doing here. 
pls can Nigerians have info on this.

7007 2018-11-03 23:15:37 .russia needs to expand to find other natural resources so that they are not just dependent on their oil supply @geography_411
7008 2018-11-03 23:15:29 Coconut oil girl! I just take it right out of the container, massage it into my hands until it liquifies, and run it through my hair (not by my scalp). Leave it in for a few hours or over night and then wash it out. Soft, healthy locks.  I try to do it a couple times a month!

7019 2018-11-03 23:14:10 Dear Mr.Muasher, you're so quick to jump into conclusions, even though you should be well aware that economic reform takes time to have any tangible effect.

7026 2018-11-03 23:13:15 The #1 determining factor in oil prices is the balance of global  production and demand.  Taking the Iranian output off the global market  has ripple effects. China will likely buy Iran oil cheaper than global rates  while US, our allies pay global prices to the profit of Russia

7053 2018-11-03 23:09:04 I use CBD oil for osteoporosis. It also may help reduce my risk of Alzheimer’s. Don’t need the THC as a general rule. But if I got cancer (G-d forbid) or another serious disease for which Israeli cannabis researchers have shown/published benefits, I would be very open to it.
7054 2018-11-03 23:08:57 The US said that eight countries would receive a temporary waiver from the sanctions, meaning they will be allowed to keep buying Iranian oil without being penalised..... are u scared of those countries? Trump is not man enough!

7063 2018-11-03 23:06:49 Lmao, no. By ororo I mean groundnut or vegetable oil. 
7064 2018-11-03 23:06:45 Where r the oil by rail or drilling incentives? All the ndp has done is increased costs for every sector while we r IN a recession. Who does this?
7065 2018-11-03 23:06:33 I don’t claim that everything the NDP has done is awful. They don’t control the price of oil, absolutely true. But they are 100% responsible for the damaging policies that they’ve put in place making lifting costs go up in a low price oil environment.

7077 2018-11-03 23:03:38 The province is suffering because of the low price of oil, not because of the government.  If it was as simple as policies being imposed,  we wouldn't have had these exact struggles in '91, '03', '08 and '12.  I'm not an NDP supporter,  but not everything they've done is awful.
7078 2018-11-03 23:03:29 Try our delicious Branzino tonight - Vanilla, White Sweet Potato Puree, Broccoli, 12 Year Balsamic, Lemon Oil. Branzino is also referred to as the Mediterranean Sea Bass, or the French Term Loup de Mer (wolf of the sea).

7080 2018-11-03 23:03:01 I make a DIY scrub with brown sugar and coconut oil and it’s everything. I store it in Tupperware in the fridge.
7081 2018-11-03 23:02:57 I do not envy the stark choice facing the Native American community in North Dakota. That Heitkamp refuses to budge or even address concerns about the pipeline & the oil patch speaks volumes.
7082 2018-11-03 23:02:53 Legally speaking, slaves weren't people, were they ? They had no rights as such. Animals were the same, even though it has changed over the last decades.

7083 2018-11-03 23:02:20 ... into a spray bottle or whatever else you prefer to use. It smells terrible, so I always add 2 drops of an essential oil.. I use peppermint. Then after shampooing your hair, you use the rice water and leave it on for anything between 20 minutes or even a few hours.

You'll surely be on top of EV cars too, the crucial window for that is between

7100 2018-11-03 23:01:39 Does weed help with your anxiety? I’d recommend CBD oil.
7101 2018-11-03 23:01:34 Lets explain. Fuel prices have risen because of world economics...trade wars, world oil production capped, and who pays the most taxes in this country it's those who stop whinging...get off their butts..and work with determination to make something of their lives.
7102 2018-11-03 23:01:26 It gets recycled and turned into new oil.. then you put it back in your car. I actually save the environment because I don’t have to drill for it. Same oil... same car. Half of it is turned into fuel.
7103 2018-11-03 23:01:23 Funny that the stores are open but no online inventory. Not for oil/spray anyway. It might be legal but for medicinal purposes, I still need a prescription. Ridiculous.
7104 2018-11-03 23:01:22 Talk to your Doc about Oregano Oil drops.......I'd avoid the Floride abx myself....hope your tests don't show resistance for doxy type abx....anyhow.....best to you...finding what works....is the key....and sometimes it takes time...
7105 2018-11-03 23:01:14 I think it's neat that the oil executives know all this junk and BS us about the best in the world regulations. I mean what's the use of best in the world regulations if no one does anything when the regulations broken? It's just BS. And mummies are only ones saying it's BS.

Mix dry ingredients with wet ingredients until you form a batter. Spray pan with coconut oil.

Pan fry on low heat slowly until bubbles appear and your ready to flip.

Once cooked remove from pan and top with some epic toppings! Makes two serves

Coconut oil works well too!

7116 2018-11-03 22:59:55 I think it's hair oil like from the 40's-50's? It just makes them look slimier...more slimy?
7117 2018-11-03 22:59:39 Looks like oil & gas, military and infrastructure make up billions of dollars in trade between Germany & Iran. I could see how Merkle would be hard pressed by German businesses benefiting from Iran trade to cut off Iran ties 100%.
7118 2018-11-03 22:59:37 What’s so damn special about synthetic oil 
7119 2018-11-03 22:59:24 Already collecting my oil

7121 2018-11-03 22:59:15 Rubbing peanut butter on a stubbed toe acts as a painkiller, due to the oil in the peanuts.
7122 2018-11-03 22:58:56 Assuming oil paint it's likely to have darkened or cracked in that amount of time. Depends on the way it's stored. Oil paint hardens though and is likely to crack. Or the canvas could deteriorate

7127 2018-11-03 22:58:26 Are you seriously engaging this clone? Have you forgot that this is the same chap who, when cooking oil shortages started to bite, accused Zimbabwean of loving “too much” cooking oil? That in neighboring South Africa, where he is an economic refugee, people don’t use cooking oil.
7128 2018-11-03 22:58:21 when I spilled the kebab oil on my shirt 
7129 2018-11-03 22:57:53 This is what needs the ban and not rice.... Our local capacity can produce what could feed even China if Cassava be the case. But no, they will ban rice, veg oil and even refined oil in a few weeks so that we can start the queuing again. Cry my beloved country!
7130 2018-11-03 22:57:49 I dropped my phone in a vat of garlic oil today. So if i stop existing on the internet just know it’s because I’m a clumsy piece of shit

7133 2018-11-03 22:57:33 Barnaby, you have seen the destruction of the Palm Oil industry in Borneo, wiping out many species, you have seen similar issues all over the world. White man has been here 200 years and look what we have done. It has to stop. Not for the dollar BJ. Water not Coal !
7134 2018-11-03 22:57:32 You don’t own an oil company. You are the recycler who collects old oil. Nothing wrong with the job, just the way you project yourself.
7135 2018-11-03 22:57:15 Thank you  @iceagentswest for supporting Zion Oil & Gas! $zn

7142 2018-11-03 22:56:37 US is a lot less reliant on external oil than they used to be. I don't see a drastic change but could be wrong. We'll see.

7146 2018-11-03 22:55:41 Oil and Gas development has done more for land conservation than any industry, or philanthropist
7147 2018-11-03 22:55:31 Poison our air and water, become a huge oil producer at a time when the opposite should be occurring, great job.
7148 2018-11-03 22:55:22 What's interesting is the water stuff. I mean oil and gas will be used by @OilGasCanada and politicians so that topdogs get rich. But when the water runs out the citizens might decide that water is more imp. than jobs. But then again it might be called fake news again. AB so neat
7149 2018-11-03 22:55:16 What we need to understand is that Alberta’s oil patch contamination is never going to be cleaned up. As for Albertans working in the patch...they know better. Dig down and you’ll find a spill at every lease.
7150 2018-11-03 22:54:44 Will help the “oil patch”
7151 2018-11-03 22:54:43 Plastic is a by product of oil.  Humans lived without it once we should be able to survive without it again. If it's not too late and the plastic already made doesn't wipe us out!

7153 2018-11-03 22:54:38 But behind the scenes, while we respond civilly or uncivilly to his crude attacks, more structural incivility is being established— corporate power on the Supreme Court, a Congressional tax cut for corporations, attacks on healthcare distribution, supporting oil ... 14/
7154 2018-11-03 22:54:26 It's difficult. I'm Dutch, so maybe I'm looking from a different perspective. But however, I think the resolution of Strasbourg in 1975 has something to do with it, oil in return of immigration and favouring Islamic thoughts.
7155 2018-11-03 22:54:11 Anything over 30% THC is not legal here yet, there's oil but it comes in a plastic bottle and is more liquid like. Not nice looking like yours

7161 2018-11-03 22:53:27 When your at jiffy lube getting an oil change and the tech says nice stickers, do u like @kaskade , um like might be an understatement sir  I only have a Kaskade, Arkade and Konnect decal on my car 
7162 2018-11-03 22:53:24 Royal... when you have time come to downtown Calgary. That is reality not your lefty stats! A once proud global Oil Industry leader is 35% vacant. Rachel has let a Trudeau lead the way and the worst is yet to come with Bill C-69. Shameful!
7163 2018-11-03 22:53:07 I’d rather have a bombastic idiot then a slick snake oil salesmen.
7164 2018-11-03 22:53:00 Sure... remember me when you’re putting gas in your car today. Don’t forget about me when you’re doing an oil change. Even electric cars need oil to move the parts
7165 2018-11-03 22:52:39 Are  all Americans  as dumb as you? Norway is capitalism its economy is heavily based on oil and gas and a small population. Its still capitalist system but with great natural fossil fuel reserves for the size of their economy. Still  capitalism!
7166 2018-11-03 22:52:24 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.

7172 2018-11-03 22:52:09 The #Democrats want voters to help them crash the economy, make the US dependent on foreign oil again, deplete your 401K's, ruin business in #Florida and #Georgia, and throw over a million out of work. In return voters get an impeachment attempt on Donald Trump? #GoodDeal
7173 2018-11-03 22:52:08 Am I’m looking for a CBD Oil that helps!  This is so wrong!
7174 2018-11-03 22:51:56 Mme H tried giving ours a teaspoon of coconut oil every now and then. Results inconclusive, apart from he loves it.
7175 2018-11-03 22:51:42 Jesus, you don’t even make sense. None of that is true. Which government owned oil companies are you thinking of? 
7176 2018-11-03 22:51:20 I'm in enough pain to be quite concerned about why I'm in so much pain. I'm so high on oil it's hard not to be a little anxious as it is. 
What a horrible feeling.
7177 2018-11-03 22:51:12 I miss getting my oil changes in Huntsville with @CocoBangScrew! Now I get asked all these questions that I don’t know the answer too like all I want is a simple oil change man lol
7178 2018-11-03 22:50:31 Shocked Mizzou got up to play today in Gainesville, shocked. I also don’t think Florida is as good as #11, though, they get the anointing oil because of their coach & logo.
7179 2018-11-03 22:50:23 ‘A Century of War’ - book covers big oil and the FLEECING OF THE UNITED STATES- via globalization. What has gone on for 50’yrs in USA is EXACTLY what the UK did.  Pres DJT HAS REVERSED the globalist money grab. God Bless and Protect- DJT
7180 2018-11-03 22:50:22  They most think the whole world has gone kuku. First their ridiculous cover up story.. Now this.. All that oil seems to have effected their sense of reality baaaadly.

7182 2018-11-03 22:50:11 Sanctions on two of the big oil producing nations, Venezuela & Iran means higher price for American shale gas & oil. The bottom line is always money with trump.

7199 2018-11-03 22:47:34 I'll say it now. If they get some financial support, that doesn't discredit anything. 
Without the billions poured into climate denial, oil lobby propaganda, fake "think tanks", etc., the combustion age would have been over 30 years ago.
Catch up.
7200 2018-11-03 22:47:30 You're so right! More People need to know more about #PalmOil and we as consumers need to boycott it and demand for it to stop being used in our food! I do my best to not buy anything with palm oil and educate others about its destruction of our wildlife and environment!

7202 2018-11-03 22:47:24 Congrats on not screwing up the recovery that Pres. Obama started. However, Trumps tariffs are already hitting the economy and the stock market. All the "deregulation" is damaging our environment. Like the off shore oil drilling you support. What about global warming?

7207 2018-11-03 22:46:47 Did you fact checked what you’re saying? I doubt that it makes much sense. America has the ability to export oil, but do you think that it’s output is sufficient to replace what Iran sends to China? Also I don’t believe that Beijing would accept such a plan. We’ll see.

7213 2018-11-03 22:45:42 Oil patch arm candy? That’s my line! 
7214 2018-11-03 22:45:38 The Pope said 8 minutes (right?) One old priest-monk I knew said, "You need to strike oil within four minutes or all you do is bore!" It should organically arise out of the readings--not a re-hash, but a bringing forth "from [the] storeroom both the new and the old.” Matt. 13: 52
7215 2018-11-03 22:45:29 You mean diaper  I don't  think we even have coconut oil..  xx
7216 2018-11-03 22:45:16 Text PERK to 27126 to get $10 off your next oil change at any Walmart 
7217 2018-11-03 22:45:12 He didn’t do health care, he did a tax. Just as many off of it and even more can’t afford what they have. His taxes were some of the highest in the world. The oil boom happened on private land not government.
7218 2018-11-03 22:44:26 Don’t hit your oil pen and string at the same time. Different level high.
7219 2018-11-03 22:44:18 You think we keep using oil for the rich people?LOL you have to be super privileged to be this ignorant.Things like carbon taxes hurt poor people,not rich,they hurt poor countries, not rich. Being environmentally conscious is a rich thing, they are the only ones who can afford it
7220 2018-11-03 22:44:16 After moisturiser or mix facial oil + moisturiser :)
7221 2018-11-03 22:44:14 I think i put about a spoonful.I didnt measure.I put one lemon juice and honey and drank it. It made the taste less yucky but powerl.I drank it at 6 pm and was eating while drinking it. Purge started mayb an hour later. N finally ended around midnight. It was haitian castor oil.
7222 2018-11-03 22:44:14 Making no judgement upon them, they are not immigrants but illegal aliens if they fear deportation. 
This is a prime example of what we are allowing our country to become by not addressing citizens in same situations, importing more similarly disadvantaged
7223 2018-11-03 22:44:13 I sell affordable coconut oil and deal in dog sales. DM for business 
7224 2018-11-03 22:44:06 I came to get an oil change and the guy gave me the fancy stuff that should have been $80 but charged me $40 and included a free car wash and vacuum. MY LUCKY DAY
7225 2018-11-03 22:43:41 Coconut oil is very good for dry lips too! Just incase you ever run out of ‘bum’ cream  xxx
7226 2018-11-03 22:43:34 I love cooking but does it ever test your mental strength when your frying oil sets off your extra-sensitive smoke detector while you've got stuff in there.
7227 2018-11-03 22:43:30 I'll oil you can make you see, our beloved planet.
 Sweet Transsexual, land of perfecting it.
7228 2018-11-03 22:43:20 Russias low % of debt/GDP is a direct consequence of going bankrupt in the late 90s - western states generally have higher debt/GDP but accumulated over a much longer time period. And Russian budget surplus/deficit swings depending on the oil/gas price movement.
7229 2018-11-03 22:42:57 残念、またの機会に！
OIL交換もやってるよ( ^_^)／
7230 2018-11-03 22:42:45 Shocked...
Anyway, my mom just tried CBD oil and she is, and I quote, "unable to move."
7231 2018-11-03 22:42:21 And oil companies/producing nations the world over. Iran would love for oil to be at $120. 
7232 2018-11-03 22:42:01 First come nap then comes workout followed up coconut oil. #Self
7233 2018-11-03 22:41:50 Just like Trump. A snake oil salesman. Birds of a feather flock together. GOP: Where are the adults in your party??
7234 2018-11-03 22:41:44 We don’t actually need Saudi oil. Canada is our largest oil source. Oh, and they were designated a risk to national security, not the Saudis. Probably because they have glowing balls and our president is in debt to them.
7235 2018-11-03 22:41:44 I’m sure R’s are not done.  This is not the R party as I know it though.  It has morphed into something totally different.  Trump has bamboozled you.  It doesn’t make you bad or evil.  He is a premier snake oil salesman, always has been.
7236 2018-11-03 22:41:33 Snake Oil Salesman!
7237 2018-11-03 22:41:27 So vitamin c oil for scaring goes on last? I thought you do your face like the LOC method for natural hair.
7238 2018-11-03 22:41:15 On days Rutgers doesn't win, the next best thing is always seeing Penn (Ped) State getting destroyed. Always makes Saturdays better. Fuck that snake oil salesman Franklin. #RFootball #GoBlue
7239 2018-11-03 22:40:54 Today
The USA has set Sunday November 4 as the last day that the nations of the world have permission to buy oil from Iran
7240 2018-11-03 22:40:41 Put Coconut Oil on that you be fine.
7241 2018-11-03 22:40:32 I thought air fryers don't use any oil at all, but this one looks like it does hold oil.
7242 2018-11-03 22:40:26 Then why don't we help him decide if they don't want to change their political and economic policies then we pulled every corporation out of Mexico and we stopped buying oil from Mexico although that may be severely hurt American automakers and raise gas prices up to $5 a gallon
7243 2018-11-03 22:40:25 or you could just setup an aroma therapy therapy & put some lavender in there & it would help thos migraines too or u could just sniff on a bottle of lavender oil! LOL
7244 2018-11-03 22:40:23 おにーさんにまかせとけー！
7245 2018-11-03 22:40:13 I like 2 better, although you do get a bunch of visual "meaning" in the oil spilling over on the first one.

Textures are great.
7246 2018-11-03 22:40:05 ああ、これ？スポーツブラ。油の貯蔵庫が垂れちゃうからね。
7247 2018-11-03 22:40:02 US produces about half of the oil it consumes. If US sells more oil (to China), it should buy more oil (from where?)
7248 2018-11-03 22:39:43 #UPDATE: Several high level officials in #Iran have threatened that if their oil is not exported, they will seize Saudi oil tankers and attack the gulf states with missile strikes. Tensions in the region are growing. -Gage
7249 2018-11-03 22:39:21 Was the brownie sativa because that would definitely keep you up. Try a CBD Indica oil blend!
7250 2018-11-03 22:39:03 Get down to rural Limerick were people don't bother reporting crime anymore. In the past Travellers used to empty heating oil tanks, now they actually take the Tank as well. No fear of the law.
7251 2018-11-03 22:38:54 I swear by tea tree oil and apple cider vinegar
7252 2018-11-03 22:38:49 I dont know if ur able to take baths Beth, but if u can u should an epsom salt bath with lavender essential oil, the magnesium absorbtion & lavender will clear those migraines with a quickness & Im sure your fast food diet aint helpin! :p
7253 2018-11-03 22:38:35 Seeing shyster Obama on the campaign trail reminds me of snake oil salesmen from old Gunsmoke episodes I used to watch with Daddy.
7254 2018-11-03 22:38:09 Coconut oil is the dogs bollox
7255 2018-11-03 22:38:02 New oven has a real clear window so I can obsessively watch the oil splatter around on it's shiny new surfaces.
7256 2018-11-03 22:37:55 Napaka Oily ko daw HAHAHAHA pero nung nilapitan ako ni Tita Natawa sya kase di daw oil yon kundi Umitim talaga ako HAHAHAHA
7257 2018-11-03 22:37:50 or enquire as to whom the beneficiaries of the gippsland oil fields are?
7258 2018-11-03 22:37:03 F UCK !!!!!!!!!! I WON T SP OIL ANYTHING BUT ITS NOT SPOILERS I PWOMISE IM JSUT ASSUMIGN HES GONNA
7259 2018-11-03 22:36:44 Hmmm looks like it looking like aurora is sending their oil to non medical patients first.  Which sucks because we fueled the growth of their company
7260 2018-11-03 22:36:39 Maybe sbb makeup remover mcm micellar water tu not as strong as cleansing oil hehee
7261 2018-11-03 22:36:10 And Stalin backing out of the agreement with Hitler was instrumental in knocking the oil out of Hitler’s equation
7262 2018-11-03 22:36:05 I need a stress candle and oil or something right now.
7263 2018-11-03 22:35:54 spilled a little bit of sesame oil on my bedsheets but im lazy to clean it when its just 1 inch stain and i just changed my sheets yesterday zzz
7264 2018-11-03 22:35:39 Not that child labor is right  - or always wrong, because that's certainly untrue - but coal, oil (Rockefeller started working as a child), steel, etc also had lots of child labor.
Perhaps better to view this as a snapshot of a moment in the history of African development.
7265 2018-11-03 22:35:17 I too have been waiting for CBD oil on the medical site there isn't even any in the coming soon.  The past 6+months have been awful. From the other reply looks like it's being routed to non medical consumers.  Not happy at all
7266 2018-11-03 22:34:21 On that Omega Oil
7267 2018-11-03 22:34:19 Olive oil with flakes of oregano
7268 2018-11-03 22:34:15 What good are reserves of oil and gold when there’s no food or medicines? When children die of anemia, renal patients die of lack of dialysis, families eat from garbage, no transportation, being a prisoner in your own home because of staggering crime, work wages cannot buy food
7269 2018-11-03 22:34:05 you will never get the same price as sweet light crude , for heavy tarsands oil no matter where you sell it , the rhetoric that you will get a better price in china is not true!!
7270 2018-11-03 22:33:38 Also, you can revive dry herbs by toasting them lightly in oil before adding the rest of the ingredients. Thyme is unbelievably better this way.
7271 2018-11-03 22:33:09 Another tactic/distraction from the Liar & Chief attempting to play Jedi mind tricks & he's HORRIBLE at it.  His snake oil salesman pitch only works on people who need someone to blame for their failures in life.  A toddler could see through this.
7272 2018-11-03 22:33:05 MAMBA

7276 2018-11-03 22:32:22 lrt just reminded me that I have to get an oil change soon :-/
7277 2018-11-03 22:32:21 As a gesture of good will, use it to start building the oil pipeline from the west. After all Alberta has been helping Quebec finances for years.
7278 2018-11-03 22:32:19 Oh no!! I started putting bio oil on mine! Have you tried that?
7279 2018-11-03 22:32:19 Whole time I been driving round wit no oil in my car smfh.... I feel like a female with a car lol
7280 2018-11-03 22:32:06 We need leaders that will restore the policies that helped to eliminate our dependency on fossil fuel, oil, chemicals, and lead us back into the way of restoring, conserving and using green energy! I hope this starts when we take the house on Tuesday! 
7281 2018-11-03 22:32:06 Need to get that oil hot....
7282 2018-11-03 22:32:05 Coconut oil, microwave it and use it as a hot oil treatment. It really does work. Put it on your ends and leave it in for an hour or two!
7283 2018-11-03 22:32:00 Trump admin is so inept in policy/legislation that they gave Azerbaijan a waiver on iranian oil but didnt exactly spell out TCP/White Stream so now it actually can apply to BP operations in the North Sea where Iran has oil interests.
7284 2018-11-03 22:31:46 I hate delivering to beautiful people bc like they look so great and happy and I’m all smitten but I am more or less a troll doll dunked in vegetable oil and the customers literally cannot wait for me to leave their property
7285 2018-11-03 22:31:40 Dude nearly as bad as the "war for oil" people sometimes.  I mean, maybe it would have been nicer if someone had just cut the lines on Saddam's breaks or drove Udday and Qussay into Euphrates handcuffed to their steering wheels with some jumper cables attached to their balls...
7286 2018-11-03 22:31:38 @comickelsey Hey my friend, personal question.
Beard oil or no?
Mighty beard is a pretty bold claim is all I'm saying.
7287 2018-11-03 22:31:12 I envy you.  I have no oil and gas wells near me.  I wish I did.
7288 2018-11-03 22:30:56 Pantone oil. Rub it on. Leave it in. Your hair soaks up what it needs. Stops frizz
7289 2018-11-03 22:30:50 extra virgin olive oil?
7290 2018-11-03 22:30:48  them tablespoons of bs oil
7291 2018-11-03 22:30:32 14 million that is million!! of people in Yemen are going to starve to death!wht is wrong with the world. Saudi's take your f'ing oil and leave. shame on all of us
7292 2018-11-03 22:30:15 @PeoplesMomentum @unitetheunion @scottishlabour @ScotTories Humbled by this evening’s programme on Dunkirk and the stoicism of the True British people. Supporting those really not deserving benefits and looking to kill the oil business is not True British-Labour,Unite reflect.
7293 2018-11-03 22:30:11 Beware of Emmerson Mnangagwa. He can announce anything!

Discovery of cooking oil deposits.
7294 2018-11-03 22:30:05 Faith is the oil which feeds the lamp of hope.

7295 2018-11-03 22:30:01 wtf I love CBD oil now
7296 2018-11-03 22:29:42 Fort McMurray Alberta.    Oil Cuntry
7297 2018-11-03 22:29:34 Yes they are in bed via oil, money and greed
7298 2018-11-03 22:29:34 how tf do i date & work for mechanics but my car needs an oil change, tires checked, and a headlight 
7299 2018-11-03 22:29:28 ... Premier Notley, 

I admire your approach. 

Fair. Firm. 

I believe in you, Premier Notley. 

I am confident that you & your team actually, really could break the U.S. monopoly on our oil than is keeping Canada over a barrel. No small task. 

Glad to help.
7300 2018-11-03 22:28:47 .@JZarif US sanctions have nothing to do with Iranian policies they are just meant to boost US oil companies pumping therefore Iran has a lot of peaceful homework to do..., Sir..

Talks with Gulf states such as Island solutions etc...
7301 2018-11-03 22:28:40 one missing 
but you are all Legends of this great journey.
guess no one will forget me either. 
7302 2018-11-03 22:28:35 He holds 6,968,351 shares las time I checked. Oil & Gas is risky but they have a very diversified portfolio. If Colter is a success I think it will go very well but its still high risk.
7303 2018-11-03 22:28:33 Flames player goes down with the puck and the Oil heads to the box for 2
7304 2018-11-03 22:28:33 Mexico is a perfect example
Mexico is our number to trading partner and they are in the top four oil exporters to the US and with the billions of dollars that they receive from the American consumers the Mexican economy works on a trickle down economy
Workers make $10 a day
7305 2018-11-03 22:27:36 Like oil
7306 2018-11-03 22:27:34 An oil change dude
7307 2018-11-03 22:27:33 Business idea - Basic car service as a service. 

They come to you, inspect your car once a year, and change your oil every 2-3 months. Premium plans include a wash every 1-2 weeks. Set monthly fees. All the basic car servicing that you don't want to do - where your car is at.
7308 2018-11-03 22:27:05 If they create a Euro super league I’m saying they might consider the divisional set up like the nfl has.  No relegation. Virtually always 1 or 2 wins off a playoff spot all season.  Probably put in a salary cap to stop teams owned by oil giants having all the best players.
7309 2018-11-03 22:27:03 yieeee thankyou mommy sa poster color  , paint brush and oil pastel
7310 2018-11-03 22:27:00 She do what I say she a jump off a cliff, I might fuck yo mama got love for the milfs

If you try to rob you get spoiled like milk, I’m pourin up oil I’m slow den a bitch!
7311 2018-11-03 22:26:43 It’s the oil from hands burning off
7312 2018-11-03 22:26:37 Norway Sovereign Wealth Fund created under Conservative government!!, taxed companies extracting oil from Norwegian waters. SWF now worth>US$ 1.1 trillion, owns 1.3% global stocks, 2017 earned US$131 billion. Aust mining tax became partisan debacle, public robbed
7313 2018-11-03 22:26:19 and the process was spearheaded by people outside of the oil industry and involved massive consultation so that “big oil” comment is simply a re-writing of history to suit your narrative
7314 2018-11-03 22:26:09 There is a standard engine (1.4 liter, I think) and does need oil changes. However, we drive so much on electric, with the oil life monitor, we haven't needed one yet after about 18 months
7315 2018-11-03 22:26:01 ... BUT, we must not allow our country to be bullied out of the global oil market - least of all by U.S. interests that are doing NOTHING to land-lock their own  crude.

#TarSandsCampaign isn’t helping the environment one bit. 

It’s time that #TarSandsCampaign comes to an end.
7316 2018-11-03 22:25:33 double cleansing with a salicylic acid based cleanser, using rose water, witch hazel and almond oil changed my life
7317 2018-11-03 22:25:12  Getting my essential oil order ready for the month. Let me know if you need anything. :-)
7318 2018-11-03 22:25:07 "huwezi kuichafua oil chafu itakuchafua"
7319 2018-11-03 22:24:46 The “Infused Preroll Joint”  is a novel concept: flower rolled with oil/concentrate/hash...but to this day I have not seen one that burns evenly, in fact they are so disastrous I break them apart and put it in a proper utensil. 
7320 2018-11-03 22:24:41 Ooohwee this blue eyed tall drink of water needs to stop telling me bout my oil change n air filter... I could stare at him all dang day! #BeardGang #SinglenotSorry
7321 2018-11-03 22:24:37 Alrightttt did my nails got my massage took my car for an oil change & a wash  - now to clean & do laundry
7322 2018-11-03 22:24:23 ... As far as I can tell, the U.S. funders of activism against Alberta oil have 4 main goals, and actually, I think we can agree on 3 out of 4: 

Renewable energy, energy efficiency & energy security, that’s all good. Let’s work 2gether on that. 

BUT ... !!! ...
7323 2018-11-03 22:24:17 Remember to oil the living breathing scalp underneath those sew ins ladies

7326 2018-11-03 22:24:12 Dig a moat and fill it with Texas oil by tapping into a pipeline. Have border patrol armed with zippos.
7327 2018-11-03 22:24:00 ahhh ! That makes sense. I’ve used salt before for stains, but that’s brilliant with the oil. :)
7328 2018-11-03 22:23:45 I really need to cop my CBD oil to stay sane but the problem is that it's literally never a priority for me and when I need it I never have it on hand smfh
7329 2018-11-03 22:23:41 I've lost all sense of time inside Lucas Oil.
7330 2018-11-03 22:23:39 Yes, but higher oil prices can also help curb carbon emissions, which should also be one of our policy goals.
7331 2018-11-03 22:23:38 Says the guy rejecting climate science because the oil companies tell him to.
7332 2018-11-03 22:23:35 It’s the caravan of desperation. The caravan of love got bombed by Britain to extract the oil from its axles.
7333 2018-11-03 22:23:31 @Coach_Odom  please don’t start spreading the holy oil cause MO is beating Florida. I’m sure you guys think Barry Odom should get a raise lol. The tigers should beat Florida with all the talent on that team. Get rid of Odom. Get a real coach.
7334 2018-11-03 22:23:14 Famines will be famines, banquets will be banquets
Some spend winter in a palace, some spend it in blankets

Paupers will be paupers, bankers will be bankers
Some own pennies in a jar, some own oil tankers
7335 2018-11-03 22:23:05 and what did Kenny do for Alberta when he was in power for 12 years, with a friendly AB PC government (that wasted billions when oil was king)?  Also why does Kenny love white supermacists and bigots? Low taxes for the rich is great just like Trump ...
7336 2018-11-03 22:22:45 In politics, follow the money often rings true. This election, certainly. 

Oil companies funding opposition to I-1631. Worth at least 30MM to them.

Soda companies funding prop to block “grocery (read:soda) taxes”.

I don’t think those companies have our best interests in mind..
7337 2018-11-03 22:22:27 Hence fort, we in the Niger Delta region are going to stop this Islamic Republic of Nigeria headed by one lunatic  called Buhari from using our oil money to fund the Islamic states like "KADUNA", where they have decided to depopulate the christians using Fulani herdsmen
7338 2018-11-03 22:22:20 and @SenCoryGardner  should check his messages from @NRA , @AFP,  and the oil and gas lobby.
7339 2018-11-03 22:22:12 I think you mean less damage to the shoreline. The oil doesn't disappear, it forms plumes in the sea column and covers habitats on the sea-bed.
7340 2018-11-03 22:22:10 @Aurora_MMJ  been waiting for medical CBD oil for a long time. still none listed in coming soon  Over the last 6+ months your medical stock has become non existent. With all the growth in your facilities where is your product? Stockpiled for non medical users? Not happy at all!
7341 2018-11-03 22:22:00 I use salt and coconut oil in a tub, myself.
7342 2018-11-03 22:21:56 Yes! And drawn with oil marker
7343 2018-11-03 22:21:54 I’m the last person on earth to finally watch Salt Fat Acid Heat. Six minutes in and I’m already sampling the olive oil in my cupboard and forming opinions on its spiciness.
7344 2018-11-03 22:21:31 omg your nursing program kicked you out??? gosh that's terrible im sorry:(( I've gotta see an orthopedic doctor this week to see if I need pins put in my ankle hhhhh but thank u for the suggestions! I'll give the castor oil and calcium a try:))
7345 2018-11-03 22:21:28 Haha  yep ole plotting arse ninjas. I be like I only came for an oil change. Not a damn thing else!
7346 2018-11-03 22:21:23 Buset Garnier yang oil sama yang biasa harganya beda jauh gitu ya

7349 2018-11-03 22:20:57 thanks for.that. fact of the matter USA has been overtaken by big business in the military arms sector, old oil and corrupt tech businesses. Pompeo is just doing his job filling their pockets whilst you all get killed
7350 2018-11-03 22:20:55 We need to tell the upcoming generation of shoppers/consumers about palm oil #replacingthousandsofspecieswithone
7351 2018-11-03 22:20:15 just spent 80$ on some high quality cbd oil B)
7352 2018-11-03 22:20:13 It’s a tricky business environment in Alaska. Between population, seasonal tourism, remote communities, dependence on state revenue from Natural Resources, mainly Oil and Gas, (our lack of fully developing them) and no state tax, while receiving more federal tax then we pay in1/2
7353 2018-11-03 22:20:11 Be sure to tell them how many millions your oil company made thanks to the #TrumpTaxScam and ask how much they saved?
7354 2018-11-03 22:20:05 Getting an oil change then streaming
7355 2018-11-03 22:20:04 Sharon bring shiling oil to the graduation & got me so good
7356 2018-11-03 22:19:52 .@antonioguterres Whereas US sanctions on Iran have nothing to do with the JCPOA but only are intended to administer dope in US OIL Companies pumping the General Assembly should vote US Sanctions NULL & VOID..., Sir...
7357 2018-11-03 22:19:40 Maybe the wells would be open if there was a pipeline to deliver the oil overseas
7358 2018-11-03 22:19:35 vitamin e oil and almond oil or even casor oil work as well as a substitute for coconut oil, mixing them all together works too 
7359 2018-11-03 22:19:26 That was Big Oil and its corrupt influences in AB politics, not the Green Party of Canada. Geeze man, I thought you tried to maintain at least a little objectivity even though I've never agreed with you yet.
7360 2018-11-03 22:19:22 My least favorite part of changing the oil in the cars is all of it.
7361 2018-11-03 22:19:15 Oil of Ulay, works a treat
7362 2018-11-03 22:19:11 Sorry patty but theres lots worse out there then the stranglehold regulations Obama put on the industry. Why don’t we get rid of oil cause they have more money then the coal industry and they have the world by the balls. Gradually reduce coal usage just don’t shut it down
7363 2018-11-03 22:19:06 Lmfaoo girl i just got my oil change yesterday my dumbass has my car waiting for exactly 4 months don’t do it

7366 2018-11-03 22:18:48 There is a reason to Bolsonaro, its simply put destruction .
Once the Amazon forest is wiped , like you said one of the planets lungs is gutted .
Next is Indonesian forest and the palm oil.
7367 2018-11-03 22:18:43 How else are the Liberal and Nationals supposed to virtue signal other than by wasting $500 million on a monument? We’ll send your kids to fight wars for oil and lies about WMD and then we’ll build a bigger monument so we can have more selfies in front of it. Win! #insiders
7368 2018-11-03 22:18:11 Hey @BretStephensNYT, that's not intelligence. That's the innate behavior of a predatory snake oil salesman..
7369 2018-11-03 22:18:08 Well .... for once they are actually, sorta kinda, " Protecting Americas freedoms"
At least these migrants can actually reach America. 
Unlike ISIS. Or the Taliban. Or Al Qaeda.... or Afganistans oil, whoops, never mind that last one.
7370 2018-11-03 22:17:54 I wonder what the Economic Hitman would have to say about OPEC, the Oil Crisis of the 70's thru... thru around TODAY!!  I suppose he wasn't so effective.. 

Thanks to Fracking we don't need OPEC so much..
7371 2018-11-03 22:17:36 Republicans are never going to shut down oil and natural gas exploration, which is the only way coal could be kept alive.
But the GOP will lie all day long to get your vote.
7372 2018-11-03 22:17:08 try to wash ur hair less often, ur hair needs ur natural oils to keep it healthy.. and put coconut oil all over ur hair for a fee hours or over night then wash it off and apply keratin oil on ur tips after
7373 2018-11-03 22:17:05 Snake Oil Salesman, stop playing politics with the criminal justice system. There are a lot of issues you can talk about, address those.

7377 2018-11-03 22:16:44 Just like stock prices, there are multiple factors that go into the price of oil. It’s even more complicated at the pump. 

I wouldn’t reduce it simply to the geopolitical issues surrounding Iran. 

The key is to keep producing.

7381 2018-11-03 22:16:37 I agree Adrian..the potential here is very good.

He actually looks very smart and the little hankey in the top pocket.

7383 2018-11-03 22:16:09 Bought mayo instead of coconut oil at Trader Joes by mistake, don’t know how well this does in comparison for moisturizing my skin
7384 2018-11-03 22:16:00 Kachu
7385 2018-11-03 22:15:58 import oil from Iran ?
7386 2018-11-03 22:15:56 That wasn't me critisizing his strategy, just admiring how he consolidates companies when incentives are about to run out. I'm sure oil and agriculture both out pace his subsidies.  Both industries essentially receive a corporate welfare entitlement, which I don't like
7387 2018-11-03 22:15:55 ... Needless to say, it’s important for all us Canucks, especially our leaders, to be aware of the magnitude of what we are up against if we are serious about breaking the U.S. monopoly on our oil. Let’s be frank, that is what we are trying to do. Big challenge. HUGE.

...
7388 2018-11-03 22:15:53 Harsh. I bought some snake oil from this chap and my snake has never been oilier
7389 2018-11-03 22:15:51 Which one of you mens want to vacuum out my car and change my oil? I am a damsel in distress

7392 2018-11-03 22:15:37 But of course it's all about $.It's a race to wipe this planet clean from all our resources. 
Palm oil , dark fossil energy , pharmaceuticals, chemicals ect. That makes billions,  clean resources not so much.That is why this society is against green resources. 
No money no honey
7393 2018-11-03 22:15:35 Price of oil also heavily influences the price of raw materials used to make plastic, too, and we all know who spends the highest percent of their income on plastic goods...
7394 2018-11-03 22:15:30 I have anemia and low iron and that yh so my nails always break when they grow long, anyway I been running argan oil on my cuticles and they are so strong now <3 use it LADS
7395 2018-11-03 22:15:13 Trump hasnt helped matters in that regard, but who is president has little to do with the US's lack of adoption of solar power.  That's more due to lobbyists of oil and electrical power companies. Disgusting really. Show me a president who abolished lobbying and I might vote XD
7396 2018-11-03 22:15:05 South Australia has lost the protection of a Labor State Government & now the Federal LNP which control Oil&Gas tenements will probably give the go ahead because Tories only destroy not build,sell never save,embezzle never share #auspol
7397 2018-11-03 22:15:05 Sorry Jim but I do not drive a Prius, I drive a SUV. That’s why I care about gas prices . I do not work for or own stock in any oil company, so how will I benefit from the country exporting American oil ? Supply and demand will increase cost.
7398 2018-11-03 22:14:59 My sisters bff from Houston came to visit and bought a wax pen and 2 gs of oil while here My sis kept telling her wait till ur home!!

I wanna see Crypto money countries soon :0
7409 2018-11-03 22:14:14 Keep your failure driven tries like you earlier US presidents did. You guys already lost as couldnt bring Iran Oil exports to zero. Even Iran will emerge as much stronger because of these sanctions... And sanctions isnt new thing for them. #Trump #Iran
7410 2018-11-03 22:14:04 Ouch! You’re allergic… apply Tea Tree Oil, it’ll soothe the itching & help heal the spots x
7411 2018-11-03 22:14:03 Noooooooope. No pics of this mess. (It’s also got coconut oil in it to help repair the damage.)
7412 2018-11-03 22:13:59 Let me know how it goes! I was freaked out about it and did a bunch of googling and ended up on ~cold pressed flax oil~ but idk if that’s actually necessary.
7413 2018-11-03 22:13:58 Kwantinuuu , u go see result soon
7414 2018-11-03 22:13:49 Aha!!!
Do you have sesame oil, red pepper flakes and ginger? If so, heat a little oil in a pan. Add pepper flakes and ginger. Heat add a little soy sauce and pour over the dish. This should correct spicieness. About a 1/2 tsp of each.
7415 2018-11-03 22:13:38 Folks in Montana used to put snake oil salesmen on a horse and ride them out of town.

All these shows is just for IRAN OIL
7418 2018-11-03 22:13:01 See that rap shit is really just like oil of vitriol, the king of chemicals
7419 2018-11-03 22:12:48 I know, but mine is Black castor hair growth oil so there’s a mix of oils
7420 2018-11-03 22:12:33 No one wins @ $120 oil short or long term.  Global economies can't grow at that price, Japan and EU likely will tip into recession, worse in emerging markets.  With ~30% of S&P500 revenues originating outside the US we'd slow, maybe to the point of recession.  Is Iran worth that?
7421 2018-11-03 22:12:19 President Trump reimposed the US sanctions on IRAN, lifted under the lame Obama nuclear deal - fully breaking with the fantasy that rogue nations can be appeased or bribed into changing their criminal behavior - The sanctions are aimed at their oil industry - 80% of its revenue

Just drank tap water out the hose as a kid

And my granny used to make us use olive oil on our skin instead of lotion. Or old ass Vaseline aka grease
7428 2018-11-03 22:11:52 that oil change it got me lmaoo
7429 2018-11-03 22:11:47 Just vegetable oil, I heard Olive oil wasn't great cuz it has a low smoke point and I had vegetable oil on hand
7430 2018-11-03 22:11:44 Clove oil! Trust me, it’s the best.
7431 2018-11-03 22:11:39 They want Israel to withdraw to its original borders and remove their illegal squatters from Palestinian land.Seems that's too much for Israel to give! Israel has its eye on Palestinian natural resources under the sea off Gaza,the oil and the gas!

7438 2018-11-03 22:11:03 Blacks should reflect on this and change,look at Nigeria with over 500b earned from oil,there is not one area we can be proud of
7439 2018-11-03 22:11:01 How much snake oil did @theRealPJFleck sell the Goopher fan base that they are all calling for the D coordinator to be fired at not him
7440 2018-11-03 22:10:43 Looks like a bunch of oil to me
7441 2018-11-03 22:10:42 He crashed somewhere on the straight road between 'yes' and 'no'. With a screech of tyres and a cigarette-flicked oil slick, his pause caught fire.

I'm guessing that this will go on until oil or water is finished. Citizens don't care in AB. Jobs, $$
7443 2018-11-03 22:10:39 Looking at previous US adventures abroad, with the exception of Afghanistan, all have been centered on oil…

7445 2018-11-03 22:10:28 Are the consequences of building pipelines in Canada and making more money that can be put towards our post oil future worse than the consequences of supporting foreign oil, including billions of $ that go towards financing war and human rights abuses?

7451 2018-11-03 22:09:29 It's a short interview but very interesting. SS says #UKOG wants the company to be a mid cap company . Talks of 1 or may be 2 Wytch Farms . Extra wells. 

Bearing in mind this  was in 2016 it's all going to plan right now.

despite 'quantitative easing' for, if other countries
know that they  will be protected by the U.S., they
will trade oil in the dollar, and they also know
they won't be invaded, like Iraq.
7454 2018-11-03 22:09:13 I am capitalism and the Arab Revolutions are dangerous because the region is now in a position to export both oil and revolution.
7455 2018-11-03 22:09:13 No one data point is never a good yardstick but ISM is pretty important puls very weak oil & industrial together I would expect the market to react positively yields down and not make new highs. From a technical perspective, you give weight when the market ignores good /bad news

7461 2018-11-03 22:08:32 I bought an oil diffuser today. And I may be obsessed with it.

7467 2018-11-03 22:08:05 The guys at my @jiffylube are the best! My kiddos were sleeping soundly in the backseat and they did my oil change while letting me stay right in the car with them  #loyalcustomer

You simply refuse to read the answer....finance success is not about a single answer. It's the accumulation of results 

There is none so blind as those that choose not to see. You are confusing loyalty to reality

7470 2018-11-03 22:07:30 the concept "prevented by law from pumping their own gas" still blows my mind a little. if you can't even pump gas how you gonna safely use and refill a woodstove, old kerosene space heater and oil lamps? (none all that hard but do take some commonsense and a bit of practice ime)

7479 2018-11-03 22:06:38 So are you saying Invictus is lying? At no time did President Mnangagwa state that an oil discovery had been made in Zimbabwe, but that the exploration activity being undertaken by Invictus had positive indications and that an exploration well would be drilled to confirm
7480 2018-11-03 22:06:37 As you know well, it’s hard to solve a problem that we misunderstand. This is why it’s important that the activism against Alberta oil is properly understood. Alas, there are many misconceptions. Take for example, the myth that the big bucks behind Tides is George Soros. Not so.
7481 2018-11-03 22:06:35 STP is a logo for an oil product and they use to give the stickers out free. But back in the sixties STP was also the street name for an LSD...thing is it was considered a bad drug, inferior to say oswley's

7487 2018-11-03 22:05:55 Ask about Greg Pence and Kiel Oil Co.
7488 2018-11-03 22:05:07 See ear specialist, they have a tool to suck it out. Or old school Way is to pour olive oil in the ear to drown it out...
7489 2018-11-03 22:04:50 Seems to me if I change my oil and keep the filter eventually it ends up the same

7497 2018-11-03 22:03:15 With the U.S. oil and natural gas market continuing to boom, and production of both rising, FreightWaves’ chief energy analyst Mike Mitchell has written a primer on what happens during the fracking process.

7498 2018-11-03 22:03:04 Father in law paid for my oil change and filled my tank up  aww #grateful he’s the sweetest
7499 2018-11-03 22:02:49 Not last season! Remember, it took oil city £2billion and 5, seasons to get out of the group stage
7500 2018-11-03 22:02:46 The rain kind of gives the photo the look of an oil painting!
7501 2018-11-03 22:02:46 Super duper douche bag thing to say “I forgot to mention I also own an oil company. I’m already rich.” Wow. Nobody cares about that other than you. Always try to remember, the first step is admitting you have a (thinking) problem and then you can take steps to improve.
7502 2018-11-03 22:02:42 $100 for tow, $120 for 2 tires with rims, labour and oil change for $120. So happy to get off lightly $-wise.

7506 2018-11-03 22:02:08 Why are you let them to sell the Oil to some countries? Either you stop it or let it go , this game was plying since 40 year with us as Iranian,

7508 2018-11-03 22:01:44 I wanted a place where I could get my oil changed and my hair cut at the same time. 

It was a Walmart. 

I wanted a Walmart.
7509 2018-11-03 22:01:17 Gas and oil will be here for a long time to come, whether you like it or not. Those green ideas are way to expensive, and nobody wants to show the cost of clean up, after they have run their short life cycle.
7510 2018-11-03 22:01:15 Rick Simmons Oil is the best medicine in the world! The roots have medicinal properties, the stock has medicinal properties, the leaf has medicinal properties, the whole plant is a #gamechanger and why pharmaceutical companies are spending hundreds of millions to fight MMJ

7515 2018-11-03 22:00:31 Reese’s actually shouldn’t be kept cold per the phone call I had with their support. It dries out the peanut butter and the oil that keeps it moist and dries it to make it more chalky. If you do refrigerate them make sure and eat them soon after for the best quality.

7517 2018-11-03 22:00:29 Why can’t India import oil from Saudi Arabia,instead of Iran?Same question to 7 other nations that were given 6 months waiver for getting oil from Iran
7518 2018-11-03 22:00:04 spices double the power of your immune system (i read the book -same title)
i like "mongolian fire oil" fried shrimp dipped in ground black pepper so that right after you eat one sweat beads up on your Nose in a minute. That kicks the FLU right out of me  60 % rest i treat> cold
7519 2018-11-03 22:00:03 Hate the cars, not the oil.
7520 2018-11-03 22:00:02 Few things beat growing your own shit. I harvested some lavender today & I can’t wait to get home and make an essential oil with it.

#Oil #gas #fracking #freight #trucking #WhitePaper
7522 2018-11-03 22:00:00 And China may buy our oil instead of from  Iran. #winning! !!!!
7523 2018-11-03 21:59:15 President Trump has also ignored treaties of native Americans by letting them trespass on tribal land to instal the oil pipe lines. Several have already leaked and destroyed thousands of acres of Indian land. These oil companies also desicrated Native American burial grounds.
7524 2018-11-03 21:59:14 It would be effective against the US sanctions, but not (for long) against serious EU sanctions, because Russia/EU trade is much bigger.

IMO: this will most likely all be used up during the next serious recession because oil prices will crash (as usual during a recession).
7525 2018-11-03 21:59:13 Oil. Overpopulation. Fighting over land. Why is Saudi Arabia fighting with them? If it wasn't for our insaitable appetite for oil, they wouldn't be in a war.
7526 2018-11-03 21:59:07 Quite possibly, however my point was that rough seas also do this (without chemicals), and thus reduce rather than exacebate oil spill damage
7527 2018-11-03 21:59:04 No my friend. This snake oil salesman / tv personality and his grifting family are using the Whitehouse to further as many business initiatives as they can for themselves. So working for free is not their objective.....they will make more money than if he recieved a wage
7528 2018-11-03 21:58:52 Lol go try to use gold or oil to pay for admission to a hockey game and see what they say.

Heck try to use a $1000 bill 

There's ways to hack around it for now. Give it time.
7529 2018-11-03 21:58:45 The first time I went to get an oil change without my dad, this happened 
7530 2018-11-03 21:58:44 The kids will be delighted. We eat the coconut like that or extract the coconut liquid for body oil, lol, and for some delicacy like jollof rice. The coconut back is used traditionally in some remote areas as firewood.

7534 2018-11-03 21:57:42 Try coffee grounds and peppermint oil.
7535 2018-11-03 21:57:29 @pipandnut hi I buy boatloads of your nut butter but have noticed in the last month or so they aren't mixed as well. Oil on top & below often quite hard. Have u changed manufacturers? TY.

7537 2018-11-03 21:57:19 I definitely recommend trying it! Why have you been thinking about trying CBD Oil Products?
7538 2018-11-03 21:57:18 IRAN SHIA CLERIC AHMAD ALAMOLHODA SAYS IF OIL EXPORTS HALTED, SAUDI TANKERS WILL BE CONFISCATED AND GULF COUNTRIES ATTACKED: MOJAHEDIN

7541 2018-11-03 21:57:01 I went for an oil change once and I really feel I was tricked by getting more things than I needed bc my total ended up being $160+ smh
7542 2018-11-03 21:56:41 on a lot of expensive cars you can’t really change your own oil
7543 2018-11-03 21:56:29 Oh! Oil marketers? Who were those in power then, and who granted licenses to major oil marketer? Who owns the oil blocks? You're off point! In fact, off key!
7544 2018-11-03 21:56:28 No..... I tried jarring courgettes in oil earlier this year,  but something went wrong and they started fermenting..... problem is,  I could preserve it,  but would need to ensure we used it in this form! We eat pickled cornichons and onions,  but that's about it.....
7545 2018-11-03 21:56:28 So oil will lose another 3% Monday
7546 2018-11-03 21:56:16 It was a lovely dinner date tonight, my 3 girlfriends and I (in one of our houses) just cooked,served ourselves and ate,cleaned the kitchen then left,tired af... It was lovely. 
We also got to learn and prepare the food without any oil.
7547 2018-11-03 21:56:13 It’s only a line at the oil change joint when you need a oil change
7548 2018-11-03 21:56:11 I’m a non-essential oil.
7549 2018-11-03 21:56:10 The season is long, but with Oil City our here buying the Prem.. these 2 pts and the GD might do us in at the end, but who knows?!!.. just REALLY wanted us to win this game, we had our chances
7550 2018-11-03 21:55:12 Agenda: 

• oil change 
• groceries 
• new makeup 
• winter wardrobe update 
• cook 
• clean 
• video opinion
7551 2018-11-03 21:54:54 #GirlTalkZA I urgently need a supplier that sells in bulk the following items: unrefined olive, castor, jojoba and peppermint oil. Please help 
7552 2018-11-03 21:54:43 It's nearly identical to Europe's not backing Bush vs. Iraq while pocketing millions cheating on UN's "Oil for Food" (AKA Oil for Fraud)

Europeans make the most money stabbing US & Iran citizens in the back, & don't particularly believe in they're proclaiming while they do so.
7553 2018-11-03 21:54:40 round two of DIY skincare products.

something was too harsh the first time. i’m thinking the lemon juice.

coffee/coconut oil exfoliant in place of brown sugar/agave/lemon juice exfoliant.

&

turmeric/greek yogurt/agave glow mask, sans lemon juice.

green tea/ACV toner - same.
7554 2018-11-03 21:54:33 Just change my oil.. I don’t wanna hear about no possibilities just change my oil g lmao.
7555 2018-11-03 21:54:32 They will likely the use shale oil profits to expand the industry and lobby for more Republicans who they support.
7556 2018-11-03 21:54:31 men always talking bout us women never getting a oil change, well why y’all car always “in the shop” 
7557 2018-11-03 21:54:13 It’s weirdly making me hungry? Even though a big scoop of coconut oil would probably kill me
7558 2018-11-03 21:54:08 I meant coconut oil 
7559 2018-11-03 21:54:00 Please show us where he said oil was discovered, you are convenietly quoting the Herald and not the president. Also Mobil didnt say there was no oio, they said it is too expensive to get to. Invintus using latest technology not available 20 years ago and proven say its possible
7560 2018-11-03 21:53:58 Who do you think you are kidding? Sanctions in oil will most definitely hurt the people of Iran.
7561 2018-11-03 21:53:53 Lol its extremely drying i stopped using it cuz it'd strip my face of oil & in turn my skin would make excess.
7562 2018-11-03 21:53:51 OK Rob, this might be confusing.. I know confusing is a big word. 
But the reason nobody cares about Pale strainians is because they have no money or friends with lots of money, if they did, or had oil which is the same as having lots of money they would 
do you want a biscuit ?
7563 2018-11-03 21:53:30 The economy collapsed because our Saudi buddies flooded the oil market causing the price to crash, and we have been actively trying to overthrow their government to try to prove that socialism doesn’t “work”
7564 2018-11-03 21:53:28  I’m getting an oil change today 
7565 2018-11-03 21:53:18 This guy told me when Trudeau puts the CARBON TAX SCAM on us he will put all of his used oil back into the ground.
7566 2018-11-03 21:53:14 That’s funny, the left used to complain that guardsmen signed up to to defend the US - not fight in the Mideast.  All of our troops belong in the US.

I'm coming as oil
7568 2018-11-03 21:53:00 @davidfrum is a millionaire right of centre Republican who created the axil of evil in to start a war under lying premis of weapons of mass destruction all for oil. Steve Bannon a extreme-right conservative multimillionaire white supremacist wants 2 preserve white power privilege
7569 2018-11-03 21:52:42 @vapormaven Hi - I’m interested in trying some cbd oil to help my dog with his allergies. Do you have information I can review?  We would be going to the Springdale location. Thanks!
7570 2018-11-03 21:52:40 Better for everybody. Happiness lasted only 4-5 (over 20) years as long as oil was over 100 USD/b. Venezuelan government deliver USD without control and everybody here believed that could live forever without a job.
7571 2018-11-03 21:52:23 No woman has all 5

5. An oil change.
7572 2018-11-03 21:52:21 Who got some coconut oil
7573 2018-11-03 21:52:09 my sister uses coconut oil for her hair in the shower and the shower floor is slippery as hell and i almost ate shit. 
7574 2018-11-03 21:52:02 Wasn’t even with oil. My gosh. I still remember it 
7575 2018-11-03 21:51:49 les cuento algo, llene el tanque de nafta y el de gas oil de la rural, ostentoso el tipo , mal!

7579 2018-11-03 21:50:50 لاء مافيهاش volatile oil
7580 2018-11-03 21:50:42 In my view: 
Trump sanctions #Iran  less Oil on the market  Oil price soaring  Oil companies making more money .
Also the ISIS #DeirEzZor to #Hasakha oil fields.
7581 2018-11-03 21:50:40 ... For more than 10 years - TEN YEARS, a group of foundations, mostly from California (except the Rockefellers), has been running a very well-funded, multi-million dollar, international, hard hitting campaign against Alberta oil. 

For TEN YEARS. 

... (more) ...
7582 2018-11-03 21:50:36 I saw that the oil prices dropped sharply this week, and I understand that Venezuela's economic crisis was triggered because 95% of their income relies on oil.  Do you think there is manipulation of oil pricing by the Saudis?

7590 2018-11-03 21:49:07 <みなさんにとっての"オイル"とは何ですか⁇
7591 2018-11-03 21:49:06 Buy 4 bottle of olive oil, 3 king James bible, another 2 bottles of olive oil then anointing water.. sprinkle the oil then drink the water after that 
7592 2018-11-03 21:49:05 Profligate waste of money. Insensitive use of American military. Shrinking mass of asylum seekers are over 1000 miles away. Makes great TV propaganda just before election. Interesting to know who’s buying this batch of snake oil and frivolously supporting this allocation of funds
7593 2018-11-03 21:49:02 @KristenLee Hello Kristen, my 28YO son has a 2010 Equinox that has one of those infernal Ecotrash engines. Bought it in 2015 used at 77k, now at 87k and the engine started knocking. Changed the oil a year ago. It was time again and there was none left on the stick.
7594 2018-11-03 21:48:51 When it comes to oil fiction or fact it's all the same to government
7595 2018-11-03 21:48:47 Omg castor oil las night was brutal. I dnt think i can take another round lol. I wanted to do it for 3 nights. But dang lol. I must soldier one. Detox detox detox. The purge was worth it. I woke up light n happy. Bu godannmmmm castor oil nasty!!!
7596 2018-11-03 21:48:45 Alright I give up. I’ll send whoever feet pics. I’ll even put oil on them to spice it up.

Pls I’m just broke
7597 2018-11-03 21:48:37 You done for the day or are you burning the midnight oil?
7598 2018-11-03 21:48:08 Oil companies ran exactly this kind of scam about lead in the oil in the 50s. It was literally poisoning people and they hired "experts" who were willing to testify that it was perfectly fine. Why do you find them deserving of your trust in this?
7599 2018-11-03 21:47:53 Abeg tell them o... i think its also our fault we go there on whatsApp saying twitter is dope, twitter is the best and now see wetin we caused
7600 2018-11-03 21:47:51 Premier Notley, 

I wish you great success not only for Alberta but for Canada. 

I fully agree with you that the case needs to be made to all that the Alberta oil industry will meet Canadians very high expectations for stewardship of the environment. That must be done. But...
7601 2018-11-03 21:47:41 I feel like I'm missing something with crafting in #ElderScrollsOnline. I almost never manage to get materials for improving items. In 160+ hours of playing, I've seen a total of three things of dwarven oil.
7602 2018-11-03 21:47:36 The same environmentally conscious folks that said Canada East “No thank you”. Rather, buy my oil from despot nations, bring it to me in boats from half way around the world and cost our country 10’s of billions. Then I’ll flush mine and you can suck it. God I love CANADA.
7603 2018-11-03 21:47:10 Doesnt really matter since Visa overstays are not crime we are told. In a leftist world none of these rules really mean anything. What these people want is the important thing and who are we to deny them.
7604 2018-11-03 21:47:08 Will Fort Nelson be able to take advantage of their opportunity??  Or will the BC Government take advantage of Fort Nelson’s Opportunity??  Fort Nelson women still can’t have babies in Fort Nelson, and live on the 4th deadliest highway in BC, which is that way due to oil and gas
7605 2018-11-03 21:47:03 my fellow cowboys where do i purchase gun oil in this game other than the gun store cuz i’m tired of going to Valentine for everything
7606 2018-11-03 21:47:02 Iran in worse case has nothing to loose and probably will try block Hormuz. What will, for instant, caused crisis in: oil industry, tourist sector, air industry etc.etc. Nice perspectives
7607 2018-11-03 21:46:37 There is a girl by my pool getting a full photo shoot costume changes and all. I have seen too much of her ass. Another girl just showed up with a full face of make up, like with lashes!!!, and is just casually rubbing her bf with oil. What is this place? #LA
7608 2018-11-03 21:46:22 How will stopping iran from having oil help iranians? I don't understand
7609 2018-11-03 21:46:14 ffs all the food we eat is contaminated with pesticides even if we wash them off. pesticides being sprayed on crops are OIL BASED. so even running water on them will never 100% remove them

7614 2018-11-03 21:44:43 Edibles are better for you.  I'll allow you one bottle of wine, as I'm going to allow myself one last bottle of champagne when Tuesday is over, no matter what the outcome.  Then weed, dab, cbd oil, and edibles.

7616 2018-11-03 21:44:16 That is partly the point. We could require significant equity stakes to be given to government as a condition of rights to extract gas, as is done in Norway for oil. But we don’t. Nor do we tax very effectively.
7617 2018-11-03 21:44:10 Just pour a small amount of olive oil in each ear (about a cap full). It will feel weird af at first but after a lil bit you'll be fine
7618 2018-11-03 21:44:02 Really don’t want to pay this man for two new tires and my oil change 
7619 2018-11-03 21:44:00 Jokes on you. you’re either gonna pay too much or have your car die because you don’t change the oil

At this rate we will start picking refs from the crowd. They will do a better job.

7672 2018-11-03 21:37:24 The shop was out of CBD oil, but I got the CBD sativa and it really made me feel calm, and I took the edge off the pain in my back, hips and knees.
7673 2018-11-03 21:37:07 Oil prices have gone up but the GDP hasn't.
If oil prices is the overriding determinant then it should reasonably well mirror the movement of oil prices but it does not.

7675 2018-11-03 21:36:52 My question is this then if the Mobil data showed that there is little or no oil deposits but gas at most, then the risk is on Invictus is it not? The report points to a high risk venture that has a loss to the investors out of Aussie no?
7676 2018-11-03 21:36:50 What did the Russian style?

Tell that to the 300 Russians Trump obliterated on the battlefield & then tell them how USA produced more oil than Russia for the first time since 1999.

No, he's stating a fact that Russians were very active on Social Media. #Duh

7686 2018-11-03 21:35:41 Talk about throwing out the baby with the bath water. We need to keep looking for alt fuels. Oil will not last forever. Remember we are not the last generation that will live on this little blue rock.

7724 2018-11-03 21:31:11 Not only is it green, but the scalability is orders of magnitude more efficient than using oil.

7725 2018-11-03 21:31:11 Father and mother watched #nun on Friday night. I noticed on Saturday afternoon that my mom had put prayer oil Crosses on all the doors. It's so funny and so cute. Parents getting scared at horror movies. Where do I go for comfort then?! (says 29yo me. )

7752 2018-11-03 21:26:22 It might also pay to listen and not ignore the concerns of ordinary voters on the issues that matter to them. Then they might not be willing to listen to the snake oil salesmen offering the simplistic solutions .

7760 2018-11-03 21:25:03 No, so you use an oil based cleanser first to break down makeup (I use an oil balm) and then follow it with a water based cleanser.

7770 2018-11-03 21:23:21 Honestly not sure if Ive ever even had a 700 series. Maybe high 600s a time or two. Never was able to maintain consistency and adapt as the oil broke down
7771 2018-11-03 21:23:20 y can't u pick a one 
7772 2018-11-03 21:23:18 @robmckenna Hey Rob, just curious, does Chevron cut you a check per blowjob, or do they buy the monthly unlimited pass?  Also, saw your No-on-1631 ad and it was a bit hard to understand.  Friendly tip: try removing the oil industry’s cock from your throat, just for recording

7774 2018-11-03 21:22:45 Water not oil is the next best thing.
7775 2018-11-03 21:22:43 It is very weird how Dawn advertisements still center around how good it is at cleaning oil spill ducks. Like I just heard the words “tough on grease, but soft on feathers” on Pandora just now.
7776 2018-11-03 21:22:18 Sears 19.95 oil change
7777 2018-11-03 21:22:12 Otherwise just roasted roots & veg (potato carrot parsnip onion whole garlic, cherry toms, brussels) with olive oil, maldon salt & black pepper. Maybe a fried egg or two.

7782 2018-11-03 21:21:32 Completely irrational thinking. Even if all electricity for electric car charging was produced by coal, the air quality would still benefit, because electric car eneegu efficiently is greater than a combustion engine. Oil refinement takes a huge amount of energy to produce.

7786 2018-11-03 21:20:50 For bedtime: Split my hair down the middle and make two pig tails. Cover my head with a silk scarf, then I sleep on my back. In the morning I’ll put a light amount of oil on my hair and try not to play with my hair too much so I don’t cause frizz.
7787 2018-11-03 21:20:43 I’ve always said that cops and Twitter go together like oil and water.
7788 2018-11-03 21:20:38 Yes. But you'll have to oil it too.
7789 2018-11-03 21:20:25 Immigration- Ok. a bit better than JT. 
Lower Taxes- Doubtful but haven't heard that policy yet.
Oil- Ok
Isis- OK better than JT 
Carbon Tax- Ok, but what will it be replaced with since they support Paris Accord?

7796 2018-11-03 21:19:45 Chris if you can, obviously not right now, get a small bottle of lavender oil. Two drops on the bottom of each foot. Rub them together. It helps you go to sleep and STAY asleep. Don't overdo it! It can make you sleep so deeply you have accidents.
7797 2018-11-03 21:19:21 Who said in 2008: you can’t drill your way to lower oil/gas prices?

7804 2018-11-03 21:18:24 Why do not you want to hear the voice of protest, the eight major countries of the Iranian oil buyer were exempted, if that is not weak, then what? Why always pay attention to the words of your corrupt advisers, why do not you hear the protest, damn what this behavior is
7805 2018-11-03 21:18:15 Ok, olive oil cake sounds weird but it’s delicious!
7806 2018-11-03 21:18:08 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for green goddess bowls, and put some sandalwood essential oil in my diffuser.

7826 2018-11-03 21:14:09 Anyone thinking US soy oil stocks could continue to come down in a time period where they usually grow?

7832 2018-11-03 21:13:30 A drop of olive oil rubbed nightly into your nails will help them grow long and strong, and is cheaper than shop-bought manicure oils.

7838 2018-11-03 21:12:47 A direct consequence of oil price & production volume, which also directly affects our fx reserves. For someone who in an earlier tweet agrees that we are import dependent, i can’t comprehend how the correlation eludes you.

7843 2018-11-03 21:12:06 Thanks dear 
7844 2018-11-03 21:12:04 Sounds excellent idea to me - low carbon and reliable. But can see why the oil industry might not be so happy.
7845 2018-11-03 21:11:53 I also support the scientists who are scamming Americans out of tens of thousands of dollars in grant money. 

It’s putting a HUGE dent in the billions the good oil company CEOs earn. 

So I support the corrupt scientists over the moral leadership of big oil.
7846 2018-11-03 21:11:52 Went to pet co this morning and now I am getting my oil changed and my transmission fluid replaced as well WOW I am a star (I know this isn’t much but I am usually catatonic on weekends so I’m proud)

7849 2018-11-03 21:11:12 The US said that eight countries would receive a temporary waiver from the sanctions, meaning they will be allowed to keep buying Iranian oil without being penalised..... some are born with silver spoon or Trump is sick?
7850 2018-11-03 21:11:08 Oil fc is the ‘present’ now. United and Liverpool can keep going on about history but it’s Chelsea and city that’s been winning the PL since 2013 bar that Leicester title winning season
7851 2018-11-03 21:10:52 I bought this double dose of CBD oil. My aches are still here but my burps taste like weed. Leaning towards sham. :(. I want to believe.

7865 2018-11-03 21:08:44 Great ! I like the Cod and the fact that it's cooked in Canola oil.
7866 2018-11-03 21:08:42 Wait, I thought we all been knew Iraq was about oil

7868 2018-11-03 21:08:05 Zimbabwe is open for business and if you have your own reputable and big Name Company that can take out oil from under the muzarabani ground, let it come. Old Mutual Share price is very high but we can't afford their rental charges.

7875 2018-11-03 21:06:23 If you use Essential Oils & buy them off of Amazon/Ebay, or anything like that, I want to strongly recommend you don't purchase them off there anymore. Anyone can buy an oil, open it, fill it with chemicals/dilute it (anything they want), reseal it & sell it to you.
7876 2018-11-03 21:06:17 Thats enough to be atleast 2 clear at the top in almost every season excluding oil backed state owned clubs since the premier league began 15 years ago.
7877 2018-11-03 21:06:15 CBD oil has given me the ability to take naps. As someone who has suffered from insomnia my whole life, napping was something I always wished I was able to do. Especially when I am sleepy but not sleepy enough to go to bed for 8 hours. And with that, I’m going to take a nap now
7878 2018-11-03 21:05:55 YES ON 112 @hickforco  YES 112 no fracking on our inner citys not crude oil its what makes oil run.

7880 2018-11-03 21:05:27 We do all these you just said! Most of the medicine are being made in Iran, almost no food is imported, they’re all being made in Iran, weather it’s meat or fruits, we even make gas by our own ( we were sanctioned, so we started to make oil by ourselves ) and I understand that...
7881 2018-11-03 21:05:22 Just in Norway, and Paris, coal is dead. Oil slowing down.
7882 2018-11-03 21:05:11 The deficit/debt can be fixed by cutting costs in public services like healthcare.

7889 2018-11-03 21:04:13 @AmeeraDavid miss only logic is change corporate tax rate and probably get together with another oil rich country and build oil infrastructure of VENEZUELA BUY IT VERY LOW FUTURE PRICE FOR MANY DECADES ;CONTRACT AND PUT A HEAVY TAX ON IT ;AND USE IT TO PAY ++
7890 2018-11-03 21:04:13 And lastly, you can go to a dlrship and pay 20 dollars less but it takes 2+ hours & sometimes they require an apptmt. At a quick lube spot we can get you in and out in 10-15 mins. You pay for the convenience. I’d always recommend learning to change your own oil though.
7891 2018-11-03 21:04:03 Going to have to seriously look at upgrading. I've got oil radiators in my tents anyway, gets very cold in my grow space at this time of year when lights are off

7901 2018-11-03 21:03:11 And theres a giant oil field underneath it.
7902 2018-11-03 21:02:57 Don’t see the contradiction.  It’s like protesting against fracking in front of an oil rig.  If nothing else, they make a perfect backdrop for the publiclity photos.
7903 2018-11-03 21:02:54 I knew my face was oily but I was unaware of how bad it was atm. My face looked like some dumped a ton of vegetable oil on my face and I forgot me powder back in the hotel. RIP me and my oil face and hair.
7904 2018-11-03 21:02:43 benny harlem really was selling olive oil w leaves to yall for $300 i'm sick how did i miss this
7905 2018-11-03 21:02:42 The truth is- 

now Iran is free to develop its Nuclear weapons

Russia and Saudi Arabia can charge more for there oil

Trump is hoping sanctions will damage Iran enough that he can swoop in and steal their oil - which he has wanted to do for years
7906 2018-11-03 21:02:25 It goes to the US. The same market.  TMX is just another route to the US so that oil companies can make slightly more per barrel
7907 2018-11-03 21:02:22 Ha!
7908 2018-11-03 21:02:19 When are the British people going to read this and take it in? This shower of Snake Oil Salesmen/women are wrecking your economy for many generations to come! Look at the figures,they're stealing your children's future.

7911 2018-11-03 21:02:04 3. get a really good moisturizer (i use skin therapy from lush but celestial from lush and first aid beauty ultra repair cream intense hydration are both good too) 4. stay away from anything citrus; citrus eats oil which you don’t need.
7912 2018-11-03 21:01:42 A plan that relies upon resource revenues is IMO foolish&deceptive. Govt $$s should come from fees & taxation. A PST (no party has the courage to implement), higher levies on huge emitters like coal & oil sands plants, & progressive income taxes on the highest earners #ableg
7913 2018-11-03 21:01:36 warm bath w epsom salt + some lavender bath oil really helps. I’m a manager at a retail store so I’m on my feet and moving all day when I’m not running around school lol

7924 2018-11-03 21:00:17 And, Turkey, that sends you sleazy news about your 'resident' #khashoogi was purchasing oil from #ISIS when @oamaz7 tweeted the mentioned tweet.

7929 2018-11-03 20:59:48 Why bother? The AER is the oil industry regulator. Does Blair King regulate the industry? So he's not significant. The AER is the office in charge of regulatory work. So it is supposed to be the gold standard. @RachelNotley @jkenney So far it has been useless. @Alberta_UCP

7934 2018-11-03 20:59:06 Squalane is good. Me personally I prefer rosehip seed oil because it's high in linoleic acid(something that oily acne prone skin lacks) & the one squalane I tried gave me clogged pores, but it left me glowing & hydrated :/

7937 2018-11-03 20:58:36 Exactly. Had to break out the CBD oil to calm down one of them
7938 2018-11-03 20:58:27 Plus on modern cars oil ports are the size of the tip of a needle and conventional oil doesn’t have the right flow characteristics or sludge prevention to make sure those ports don’t get clogged after 75K+ miles of daily use.

7945 2018-11-03 20:57:35 Thanks for getting back to me Jayne. Can you give me any more detail about the need for palm oil in your garlic bread? It is an environmentally dubious ingredient that I try to avoid, so seeing it in garlic bread is confusing.
7946 2018-11-03 20:57:26 I just went to go get an oil change and ended up dropping $142... like what in the actual fuck
7947 2018-11-03 20:57:23 Proverbs are the palm oil with which words are eaten.
7948 2018-11-03 20:57:20 @Beautyon_ Is the point your making is that energy is infinite and can be obtained on demand, unlike say oil or gas which is limited to some degree. So the market will determine what it is prepared to pay.

7963 2018-11-03 20:56:18 The only way to get the guns is by the 'death of a thousand cuts' method. Polis votes for every gun grabbing measure. Eventually there's nothing left. The same with the anti oil and gas movement.

7967 2018-11-03 20:55:56 #CSRC2018 junk bonds correlated with equity, so not necessarily lower risk. If 2 yr yielding more than 10 year treasuries... recession expected. Price of oil up 55% this year. Economic growth trending lower. 20% chance of recession next year. Fannie Mae thinks 50% chance.

8006 2018-11-03 20:51:03 @BlogAlba
Stunning facts for when Brexiteers/Unionists say Scotland wont get accepted into the EU after Independence:
Scotland has:
1% of EU Population
10% of EU's wave energy potential
20% of EU's fisheries catch
25% of EU's wind and tidal potential
60% of EU's oil reserves
8007 2018-11-03 20:51:03 Yeah, its the regulatory process long past the Harper Government/NEB screwed up royally, the companies never got to the building part. That's why there is no growth in Alberta's oil patch today. You can't blame 3-year old governments for the missteps that happened 5-7 years ago.

8034 2018-11-03 20:46:34 Cheap? We pay less now for oil than we did under Obama. We also paid less for oil before Obama. Obama did lead us out of a recession, but only by the skin of his teeth. We currently have policies that are making the economic growth soar. Well beyond expectations.
8035 2018-11-03 20:46:14 Got some hemp oil yesterday. Can’t wait to see how it works. I hear so much good stuff about it
8036 2018-11-03 20:46:12 I think it means you need oil 
8037 2018-11-03 20:46:08 Try castor oil, hair oil, and much else.
8038 2018-11-03 20:46:08 Strange opinion from yourself. You Ian made a living for quite a few years in the oil industry. You are father fracker!

8044 2018-11-03 20:45:24 Given we can’t refine our own oil, how can the minister guarantee supply.

8046 2018-11-03 20:45:06 
8047 2018-11-03 20:45:01 We don't. Iranian oil is mostly sold to Asia and China. China is the largest purchaser of Iranian oil. Goods from China therefore will increase in price. A small adjustment in the Chinese economy can have a catastrophic ripplez affecting the global economy.
8048 2018-11-03 20:44:49 @BlaineHiggs the former govt made such a mess of the oil and gas regulations and lack of experience in inspectors you will have a hard battle selling any new exploration and extraction if you plan on allowing Sussex to frac you best do it right

8056 2018-11-03 20:43:59 235/85 Generals, old now but still good. Seems to have a faulty oil seal at the back of the stub axle (I think that's the right way to describe it). Axle oil has forced into the swivel housing, then drum, causing inevitable leaks and crap stopping.

8060 2018-11-03 20:43:25 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund, until recently it had the publisher of the National Enquirer on its board, it has a mandate to support the oil companies and is working to introduce American style conservatism to Canada. It is propaganda, not news. 
Credibility = 0
8061 2018-11-03 20:43:24 Price of oil fell to an all-time low since summer. But you won't see prices tumble in garage forecourts. They shoot up when oil prices rise but stall when they fall!

8069 2018-11-03 20:42:24 Windmills kill quite a few birdies too. Apparently a lot more than the rare oil spills. Pretty much anything Man does kills animals. And yes, I realize there are Liberals who want Mankind to die out on behalf of the animals. Good luck with that.

8083 2018-11-03 20:39:21 Nevermind. Not going to waste energy making a big meal. I cut up a cauliflower for myself, tossed it with minced garlic, a curry paste and coconut oil. I'll roast that and it'll be my dinner. Then I'll go to bed.

b)cook them until they turn black
c)throw them away as they are completely burnt

8173 2018-11-03 20:26:34 Exactly! I was literally about to say this. California is expensive because the population is growing too quickly. That happens everywhere. Even when their is an oil boom in places that were previously undesirable to live. The infrastructure becomes over burdened.
8174 2018-11-03 20:26:33 You know who loves oil at that high price RUSSIA
8175 2018-11-03 20:26:19 I feel like the oil change & the gas signal alert is the two things every girl knows  now ask me anything else?
8176 2018-11-03 20:26:08 Legalize the Patent & make all Trucks go to the Water Manifold system, instead of spitting out 2 stacks nasty smells & fumes, best part is water good enough condenses to drink dribbles out tail pipe.  It is time to rediscover technology lost & forbidden by the Big Oil Companies.
8177 2018-11-03 20:26:05 Okay, girls and gays! Here’s a quick list of oils that are SAFE for your face, and won’t clog your pores: 

•Shea Butter (in it’s solid state, too) 
•Sunflower Oil
•Hemp Seed Oil

Thanks for coming to my TED talk.
8178 2018-11-03 20:26:02 I got a great recipe for tofu...
Season with salt, pepper and fry HARD in olive oil til it forms a crust. Tip it all in the bin, and put a pie in the oven. Tofu is shite.

8183 2018-11-03 20:25:21 Spent today at the state marching band finals at Lucas Oil. After many near-misses, the Marching Mustangs (with 2 of my grandsons) won the first team championship in anything in the 60-year history of Edgewood High School.
8184 2018-11-03 20:25:17 Socialism is a bipartisan efforts. Bush bailed out the banks and airline industry and both parties have provided subsidies to oil, gas and coal industry. More recently Trump gave a $13 billion bailout to farmers. All of these are socialist policies.
8185 2018-11-03 20:25:13 Bish blocked me  is it St Ives apricot scrub? Bc ur cap explains it to a t & I'll never EVER stop using it lmao. I had to resort to making my own scrub w coconut oil, sugar & canilla extract. Not sure how good it is for ur face but I use this one from my face to my feet lol

8191 2018-11-03 20:24:04 А я вообще люблю реверс аушки! Они всегда очень интересные, и будто бы придают особенности оригиналу, говоря что всё могло быть не так. Взять хотя бы реверс Фолз. Готова вручить премию тому гению, кто первый начал рисовать Диппера и Мэйбл в этих офигенных синих костюмах.

LA already made felony arrests.
8193 2018-11-03 20:23:42 People think NZ should stay on the petroleum train because our emissions are a tiny part of the problem. They don't think we'd be better off with an economy that has already transitioned when the rest of the world is in crisis. But who will care about us then? Oil companies?
8194 2018-11-03 20:23:34 Tree cutting? What about those who get diamond and oil tenders?
8195 2018-11-03 20:22:56 We need to admit there are some fundamentals behind this selloff. 1) Highest Russian production post 1991 2) Higher than expected increase in US production 3) Opec pumping oil at a higher than expected level... And so on. Oil may be a dead asset for a while.

8199 2018-11-03 20:22:31 Policy changes can't change the constitution. The constitution makes citizenship a constitutional issue. Attempts to change it without an amendment will therefore be structure down by the courts. You can stop being silly, now.

8202 2018-11-03 20:22:09 Bernie is a buffoon, a rainmaker and a snake oil salesman. He motivates people with bumper sticker sloganeering which has no substance at all. A useless placeholder,  charlatan and  carnival barker
8203 2018-11-03 20:21:57 Some of our homeless people had warm cooking oil pored on them by some local officers back in the 80s. Those officers, deservedly, done many yrs hard time and the homeless owned the city. ANY unwanted touch by someone, even spit, can be assault and battery.

1. leave out 
2. a oil change
3. a bed
4. beefing with 0 girls
5. money for groceries
8207 2018-11-03 20:21:37 Well, let's start with pipelines. Our country is dying of energy attrition. Alberta languish. No energy revenue where there could be billions.  Saudi oil due to no pipelines of our own. Legal pot, which 7 of 10 CDNs want no part of. We can start there.

8209 2018-11-03 20:21:36 I'm thinking it irritates breakouts on me. It's supposed to be great for combo/acneic skin, but I always get breakouts when I use it. Sucks. But I've found Seabuckthorn Fruit Oil and it's UH-mazing
8210 2018-11-03 20:21:30 LOVE IS OIL
8211 2018-11-03 20:21:20 Oh look it’s the oil cheats ! As I said before Leicester real team amazing league title , City the Enron of football 
8212 2018-11-03 20:21:16 I think the solution is refining our own oil. Local refiners can be encouraged to establish smaller refineries and receive crude oil at lower rate. That is subsidize the crude exclusively for local refining.
8213 2018-11-03 20:21:04 Get some Frankincense essential oil, dear girl!  It’s such an incredible healer.  Keep some handy!
8214 2018-11-03 20:21:03 Oil prices are too many!

8216 2018-11-03 20:20:46 Bad. Just get an air fryer. Same concept no oil needed.
8217 2018-11-03 20:20:40 The honorable, magnificent, never done anything wrong, self supported Liverpool FC race clear of dirty Arab oil money, UEFA cheating, human rights destroying, FFP sidetracking, professional fouling, dodgy sponsorship attracting, no fans, no history City.
8218 2018-11-03 20:20:39 Got a 10 dollar coupon in the mail from @mrlube. Only needed an oil change, but convinced to replace two filters. Feel totally ripped off right now. Never going back.
8219 2018-11-03 20:20:33 @thebodycoach I noticed in your books that you use a lot of coconut oil. Isn’t that bad for you? Also in your new book you use pre cooked rice. Would swapping this for normal rice still taste the same with your recipes? Dave.
8220 2018-11-03 20:20:25 Seriously... 
who here on my  page has 
not tried CBD oil yet? 
8221 2018-11-03 20:20:23 Just tried to type "drizzle with olive oil" and ac changed it to "drizzle with pills". 

*adds recipe developer to resume
8222 2018-11-03 20:20:21 This way you can cook more at once and they're all evenly cooked. The fat/grease/oil drains to the pan making the bacon more crispy if left in the oven long enough.

It all depends on what you like :)
8223 2018-11-03 20:19:59 I think I’m allergic to rose water. Any time I use any product wit hit or rose hip oil in it my face gets so England’s

8228 2018-11-03 20:19:15 I need CBD oil body relaxer for my knee so bad.
8229 2018-11-03 20:19:07 Yep, oil games include war, which is pretty disgusting 

Volatility spike anyone?
8230 2018-11-03 20:19:07 Limit oil supply? Seriously? Through Afghanistan? Something to think about in leaving. Women will be enslaved, beaten, get acid poured into their faces again for sure if we leave. 60 died in Chicago over the weekend. Just a thought.

8238 2018-11-03 20:18:46 Drink more snake oil.  Sheep.
8239 2018-11-03 20:18:07 The media being funded by Big Oil, unions, and automakers is such a BS narrative.  Elon Musk has been a Media darling forever.  Which is why people like you think he is a god and worship him.   Maybe the media is on to his fakery and fraud now.
8240 2018-11-03 20:17:49 Incredible turnout at the annual HPOU Family Picnic at the Oil Ranch. Had a couple thousand officers attend w/their families, everyone had an amazing time. Great work @DannyLev626 and picnic committee putting it together. Just another way to give back to our officers #BlueFamily
8241 2018-11-03 20:17:44 Y’all REALLY be using coconut oil on your face...? Wow..

8243 2018-11-03 20:17:18 Oil of Olaz…...
8244 2018-11-03 20:17:15 What that medicine does is it dries everything out and once you stop taking it, your body will start to produce oil again so when it starts doing that you won’t be dry anymore! But it will be a process again. If you’re on that kind of medicine do NOT get anything waxed also!
8245 2018-11-03 20:17:08 Iraq primarily from Soviet Union and its satellites, France, Peoples Republic of China, Egypt, Germany (with European facilities for enhanced chemical weapons), UK, Brazil, Spain, Italy and United States (pre-nuclear, chemical & biological), Oil rich Kuwait + Saudi Arabia.

8251 2018-11-03 20:16:46 2 new tyres, break plates and oil etc :/
8252 2018-11-03 20:16:46 So the future isn’t going to be Mad max style cars hunting down remnants of oil . It will be more Steve Jackson Car wars style electric vehicles . In our lifetimes we will all see this major cultural shift
8253 2018-11-03 20:16:28 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?
8254 2018-11-03 20:16:27 They don’t want the soil, just the oil that’s beneath that.
8255 2018-11-03 20:16:25 Hey Heating Oil News(@Heatingoilnews), thank you for following me
8256 2018-11-03 20:16:25 Inventories have been going up and that is the key driver for a commodity like oil. I also think oil will eventually go higher but the question is how low can it fall first ?? At the current speed we will see WTI with a 60 handle this week.
8257 2018-11-03 20:16:24 Once I went to a white friend's house for lunch and she served me boiled pasta with vegetable oil. Like, not even olive oil or salt or anything ............... literally boiled some pasta & threw it in a bowl and drizzled some canola straight out the jug.
8258 2018-11-03 20:16:13 Just buy oil pef
8259 2018-11-03 20:16:00 Poor little guy  I've seen a few people saying CBD oil helps theirs, might be worth a try next time?
8260 2018-11-03 20:15:19 Just offering an alternative. If sensitive to castor oil (me) I use Jojoba oil for eyelashes, brows,  and my hair. No problem with stinging at all.
8261 2018-11-03 20:15:16 I got my nails done while I waited for my oil change. Tell me why I left my car there at 9:15 am and left at 1:00 pm..... 
8262 2018-11-03 20:15:14 Spiegel. Where is the evidence of oil money?
8263 2018-11-03 20:15:06 Ahhhh! I got the invitation. I need to bring the massage oil, or...?

8267 2018-11-03 20:14:19 JG. It’s over.  Fleck is a well spoken snake oil salesman. Western Michigan is not the Big Ten
8268 2018-11-03 20:14:19 It’s like an alert right? Lol it’s telling me I need an oil change
8269 2018-11-03 20:14:02 Keystone pipeline,tax cuts, pulling out of TPP and Iran deals, renegotiated NAFTA, moved Embassy in Israel, increased mfg jobs, cut regulations, lowest black and Hispanic unemployment, opened ANWAR for drilling, US now world #1 oil production. Should I keep going?
8270 2018-11-03 20:13:53 The oil smells like lemon 
8271 2018-11-03 20:13:48 Laundry oh.. But not my father's cloth

8274 2018-11-03 20:13:34 @BarackObama what did you do for this country? What did you do to the military? Sheep wake up he is liking to you ! When he was president he bowed to the King for oil. He didn’t create any jobs. His health care sucks. Yet you sheep won’t wake up use those minds get the true facts
8275 2018-11-03 20:13:23 Can get same effect from olive oil 1 dollar all us girls who have had plastic surgery know it hurts like hell getting your eyebrows pulled up and some chin shaving and fillers good effort support you on the product but so many celebrity cremes what is different about yours ?
8276 2018-11-03 20:13:21 The fact that I told everyone in my family that I need an oil change and asked if they could help me out since they’re all off and I double, and every single one said no. My car is literally burning oil and smoking, but ya, I’ll drive it home alone at 1 in the morning. Cool.
8277 2018-11-03 20:13:18 my favorite game is how long can i go without an oil change
8278 2018-11-03 20:13:13 “I suspect oil will be in the $50s in short order&that will start to rattle the high yields bond mark as shale issues high yield debt like there’s no tomorrow and that will widen your little credit spreads and everyone on Twitter will post about it the end back to my ” @hks55
8279 2018-11-03 20:13:05 I've seen some pretty large vehicles in my time. And I'm sure there are oil tankers a mile long. 

But none of them are large enough to hold the disdain in which I hold my firework-party-having neighbours.
8280 2018-11-03 20:12:57 追いオリーブもいいけど、追いフォローもよろしくな。
8281 2018-11-03 20:12:52 I hope our eyes are open to see the rot that has been done. He came and the market of oil was not favourable, he is not in control, he can only do within what we had
8282 2018-11-03 20:12:48 Dinner idea! Saute onion in olive oil and garlic until fragrant. Add pork chop and vodka sauce. Cook thoroughly. Serve with ciabatta and a bit of sliced kimchi.
8283 2018-11-03 20:12:46 This week in #Zimbabwe 

AIDS cure discovered. Then it wasn't.

RBZ governor fired. Then he wasn't.

Oil & gas discovered. Then it wasn't.
8284 2018-11-03 20:12:41 Random thought of the day: One could potentially use CBD oil as a post-CBT oil

8286 2018-11-03 20:12:29 Is sesame seed oil good for the face?
8287 2018-11-03 20:12:10 My city, Calgary, home of our oil and gas companies (think PH), has benefitted immensely from the Nigerian diaspora for well over 30 years. Many retain an interest in setting up businesses or working "back home," but they quickly get frustrated/blocked. Real lost opportunity.
8288 2018-11-03 20:12:00 Finished up my yard work for the season.  Thanks to my neighbor’s tree that dropped all the leaves in my driveway.   Time to use lavender and peppermint oil on my sore muscles and pour a glass of wine to relax.  
8289 2018-11-03 20:12:00 She does! Vape, oil, and gummies!

8298 2018-11-03 20:09:58 Oil in Zim its a curse just like the diamonds....
8299 2018-11-03 20:09:51 It removes nothing. Ex post facto means nobody receiving the benefit already would be affected.  Only changes being those in the future that never had it. Only 30 countries of 195 retain this. It's a progressive policy change.
8300 2018-11-03 20:09:40 I hate coconuts. 
I only use coconut oil when my skin is super dry. 
I found out today my hair reallllly loves coconut oil. 
The smell is still lingering with me and I’m on the verge of dying, help.
8301 2018-11-03 20:09:39 We should have taken Iran's oil. We could lower the gas prices and help save money for our crunchy roll subscriptions.
8302 2018-11-03 20:09:36 What rights.  Can I sue Iran.  I didn’t get a penny of the oil money.
8303 2018-11-03 20:09:33 Vaseline or coconut oil
8304 2018-11-03 20:09:30 So does my shampoo. And my hair oil. Yum  
8305 2018-11-03 20:09:25 Add some extra vinegar and sesame oil for salad dressing. I’ve eaten it on salami, slices of cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, and, of course, a spoon. It’s all good.
8306 2018-11-03 20:09:20 With all the People women talk to, you would think they would know someone who could do a simple ass oil change. Or you know... Do some research so you don't get taken advantage of.
8307 2018-11-03 20:09:04 You cannot count the money they got from selling it. Trust me on this one. What happened to Dolan's partner that bought in a few years ago? Dolan cashed out his illiquid asset which was a good family move ... but this guy has brought nothing. He was from oil and gas industry

8309 2018-11-03 20:08:54 I have cbd oil. I'm gonna use some and take a nap. My anxiety just refuses to quit.
8310 2018-11-03 20:08:44 Is the @bbcquestiontime now really the platform for alleged criminals, snake oil merchants and other professional charlatans? How far has the @bbc sunk?
8311 2018-11-03 20:08:39 The economy is being diversified as promised. For d first time, crude oil has been pushed to d 3rd position as our major revenue earner. The first 2 being Agriculture and IGR. Farmers are havin a fielday now producing & exporting with minimum hindrance. @CustomsNG & @firsNigeria
8312 2018-11-03 20:08:37 This is before we get to the #strongpublicinterest in why nothing's being done about Britain's shameful arms & oil relationship with the murderous & repugnant regime of Saudi Arabia. Any Tories got investments out there? It might be in #strongpublicinterest for you to find out.
8313 2018-11-03 20:08:08 How will this help YOU? Are you mining for oil & destroying the environment? Or are you just happy that Trump is happy? Take your time.
8314 2018-11-03 20:07:51 Herv save ducks from oil spills
8315 2018-11-03 20:07:40 I have peppermint oil diffusing and chillllllllllllllin!
8316 2018-11-03 20:07:39 Now into oil drilling, where is the $15b?let's  clean up our mess first.$150b will vanish also,the masses will be Somalilising
8317 2018-11-03 20:07:23 So do you agree with saving 18million in home heating fuel by having furnace oil exempt, 10% reduction in electricity, propane and wood/pellets. Added to personal tax exemption, reduced  small business tax, increased min. wage...5200 Islanders no longer pay taxes and more to come
8318 2018-11-03 20:07:19 Imagine the gall!!!

Someone that eats fufu and egg is coming at sardine oil and bread?

Anyway it's not surprising
8319 2018-11-03 20:07:18 fuckin finallyyyyyy
8320 2018-11-03 20:07:16 Split? Add a little ice water? Adding the oil drop by drop until you’re at least half way helps.
8321 2018-11-03 20:07:11 questions: quel est la quantité d’énergie nécessaire pour dissocier une molécule d'eau ? et donc pour obtenir  un litre d'hydrogène ? quel est son équivalent en litres de gas- oil ?
8322 2018-11-03 20:07:10 hellllll yethhh
8323 2018-11-03 20:07:09 Its a long season Tamara, stay positive, we are not at City's level, not owned by an oil rich country and don't fiddle the accounts, we are doing good up to now.

8327 2018-11-03 20:06:26 Lmaoooooooooooo.

I tried to hide your identity, but you have become debased and clearly no longer care. Let's forget the awesomeness that is sardine oil and bread.

You eat semo and egg!! Your status as a human is under doubt
8328 2018-11-03 20:06:23 Buy some heating oil 
8329 2018-11-03 20:06:22 Bress
8330 2018-11-03 20:06:19 Ok, reasonable but numbers are higher for cars. It is true that heavy transport is roughly 70% of all transport pollution. However, without cars you won’t have cheap enough batteries and other transportation will remain burning oil. Smog is serious, not insignificant.
8331 2018-11-03 20:05:25 did some adulting today and got an oil change lol
8332 2018-11-03 20:05:16 Norway got more than one trillion dollar saved in the "oil fund".

And all they can "afford" is to put up 2 hydrogen stations a year.

The politicians here speaks as if they are world champions in climate, but their words are not worth a damn shit.
8333 2018-11-03 20:05:12 Ngl if I was a mechanic and a girl pulled up for an oil change I'd make the price higher too lmfaoo gotta finesse
8334 2018-11-03 20:05:01 We gotta come together and put an end to offshore oil drilling
8335 2018-11-03 20:04:54 @WBSuperSeries got 150 guys on an oil rig who can't watch the fights as they are on DAZN and it's not available in the UK surely you could have got it on Channel 5 or somewhere!
8336 2018-11-03 20:04:52 No .. it was time for a oil change for my Jeep Renegade.
8337 2018-11-03 20:04:52 I have to stop rubbing my eyes after work because I always get oil and salt in my eyes and it burns lol
8338 2018-11-03 20:04:49 Ah, I get that. I suppose AJ was being careful. They are usually accused of being an "Arab/Middle East apologist".

Agreed on the last part. He lost the script at some point. Paid dearly for it.

In the end, it's all about the oil.
8339 2018-11-03 20:04:48 Sounds like fleas if california. Use peppermint sessional oil. To stop bites and chamomile tea soak to eat the ouch you have.

8343 2018-11-03 20:04:20 Jason, Hopefully you can fix these pipeline issues when your elected and we get rid of Trudeau. Good luck, lord knows Canadian Oil Industry and Canadians need it bad.
8344 2018-11-03 20:04:03 Mine is flavored with peppermint oil!
8345 2018-11-03 20:03:54 Screwfix should do scratch n sniff. The smell of that anti-corrosion oil coating you get on new electrical gear!
8346 2018-11-03 20:03:54 How did he get the video clips
8347 2018-11-03 20:03:52 I have had an amazingly productive Saturday so far which always puts me in a good mood! Went to get an oil change this morning, did every single bit of laundry in my home & cleaned my room. Now gonna go do the same to Matty’s room then go to the gym. & later, I get to unwind 
8348 2018-11-03 20:03:48 كذبوا أذانكم وصدقوا الإعلام

8350 2018-11-03 20:03:46 i started putting castor oil in it every few days!
8351 2018-11-03 20:03:46 I’m about to go get my oil changed. Watch them magically find something wrong and watch me not gaf.
8352 2018-11-03 20:03:19 Squalane oil from The Abnormal Beauty Co.   SAVED LIVES in my house this week on 3 different people with 3 different problems.
8353 2018-11-03 20:03:13 Brakes, oil leak, rain, fash flood, rain, rain, life, rain etc (in that order)
8354 2018-11-03 20:03:05 True. No margin to slip in front of oil fueled blues, pun intended.
8355 2018-11-03 20:03:02 For my birthday weekend I treated myself by doing things I haven’t had time to do like get my oil changed and go through my refrigerator
8356 2018-11-03 20:03:01 mom got me some salmon oil. shits bomb. maybe better than greenies
8357 2018-11-03 20:03:00 Report from the #WoOCraftLMS @chrismadden44 pit - a broken oil line was the reason for his retirement in the Friday feature.
8358 2018-11-03 20:02:52 @younglivingeo makes a great oil called purification that smells like citronella and they also have that oil too!
8359 2018-11-03 20:02:33 ugh the worst are the ones w meat omg, they’re so eh tasting but the normal one w olive oil? sis we nail that!! (btw i didn’t try the turkish one without meat so till then i dunno wtf it tastes like hsjsjdj)
8360 2018-11-03 20:02:28 FACT CHECK: Mimi has not once met with her constituents since being elected in 2016.  Mimi votes with trump 99% of the time. Mimi takes money from the NRA. Mimi takes money from Insurance companies and big oil. Mimi voted to take away pre-existing coverage. Mimi don’t give a F.
8361 2018-11-03 20:02:04 Are you sensitive enough that a neighbour cooking with peanut oil could cause that?
8362 2018-11-03 20:01:58 Sitting at Walmart waiting for my oil change and thinking about baking cupcakes  
never mind that means more dishes
8363 2018-11-03 20:01:36 In what way? Other then classless society, which has never happened. they nationalized most industries in particular the oil fields and have massive price fixing regimes across the country and one party rule ostensibly at the will of the proletariat so
8364 2018-11-03 20:01:28 Excellent!
8365 2018-11-03 20:01:24 there are definitely closer and cheaper places I could get my oil changed but I always go to the same place bc one time like 2 yrs ago the guy in the pit responded to every question from the guys up top in a falsetto for like 30 min straight
8366 2018-11-03 20:01:24 Excellent!
8367 2018-11-03 20:01:23 Its very enjoyable AND very handy. I think its so important for people to learn how to do simple things such ad oil changes/ tire rotations for their own good. Saves you money too 
8368 2018-11-03 20:01:16 The Venue will definitely be the place for celebrating Homecoming tonight, hosting the annual Oil Spill Party and if for some reason that isn't your cup of tea we will have another party that is sure to please right next door.  Come enjoy both.
8369 2018-11-03 20:01:08 This is very true! I hear he's in need of some1 to rub him down with his coconut scented oil  paid with full palm ass grasp lol
8370 2018-11-03 20:00:55 Lol. Abeggg. How can you trash egg and semo and be a fan of bread and sardine (ew) oil.

Look at yourself.
8375 2018-11-03 20:00:19 My wife is the same. Its not the food thats the issue although it looks like the oil needs changing its the fact they fuck up our order. Every. Single. Time.
8376 2018-11-03 20:00:11 To be safe ima just ask my dad nicely if he can take my car in to get an oil change 
8377 2018-11-03 20:00:07 Candles, beauty products, a split of champagne/wine, books, stationary, a pen, bed slippers, pajamas, a sleep mask, a small blanket, tea, a card, fuzzy socks, a relaxation oil/scent in any form

8379 2018-11-03 19:59:36 1. #Saudi policies have destabilized Middle East through political & military blunders.  2. US imports only 9% of oil from Saudi. US imports 40% from Canada; 7% from Venezuela & Mexico. US can easily ramp up imports from them. 3. Agree: US shouldn't be interfering all over world
8380 2018-11-03 19:59:29 Oil changed & bae washed 
8381 2018-11-03 19:59:28 Rustic spaghetti with ground beef, fresh tomatoes, red pepper, yellow pepper, onion, garlic, olive oil, and home-dried chili pepper,
8382 2018-11-03 19:59:27 I need to get an oil change soon and the mechanics at the dealership BET NOT play with me.
8383 2018-11-03 19:59:15 I hate bringing my car for a oil change and they try and make me pay for other shit  Just give me what I asked for
8384 2018-11-03 19:59:00 Women really paying $100+ for an oil change out here?? LMFAOOOOOOOOOOO
8385 2018-11-03 19:58:58 The problem though is I have yet to see one of the many many articles written on the subject that is properly researched and fully details costs of a #blockchain based currency against the costs of running the existing system they all miss huge chunks out e.g. drilling for oil
8386 2018-11-03 19:58:10 The Gophers defense couldn’t stop oil and water from combining.
8387 2018-11-03 19:58:09 Hard to believe this is even a debate.  Its rational and logical.  Only reason anyone would object is because they are emotionally invested in protecting illegal immigrants and their offspring.
8388 2018-11-03 19:58:06 Meanwhile, it appears that @BillGates is opining with the oil companies. I've had a disagreeable feeling in the pit of my stomach since I saw the ad.
8389 2018-11-03 19:57:57 Oh no, I misunderstood. I think what you have works great tbh. If the oil is an issue, dry shampoo usually works pretty good. I use it in combination with Wella grip cream for shine without a dry look and a boar brush for volume while protecting curls
8390 2018-11-03 19:57:52 لا بتحبو ولا شي شو بدك بالحكي يا عمي فوتي عحسابها عم تهوبر للمشنوق وجعجع وكل امة الله اللي ضد سعد الحريري
8391 2018-11-03 19:57:28 How many of y’all have heard of CBD oil? How many of y’all have wanted to try it but have been afraid to try it? Why are you afraid of taking it? If you are interested let me know.
8392 2018-11-03 19:57:17 Pls don’t call in & cuss me when you call in last minute for an oil change & we can’t get you in I will cry & hang up on you

8396 2018-11-03 19:56:39 Had #RedlineForYemen article on my site 2 yrs ago but the algorithms didn't like that.  It's because, in the end, the us needs the Saudi oil and Yemen oil and minerals to get out of 22 trillion hole, that's the way it goes. #energywars
8397 2018-11-03 19:56:27 Forgot to mention my back up is a Columbia 300 deep freeze that sometimes hooks more than my rebel. Idk why when it’s advertised as being for lighter oil.
8398 2018-11-03 19:56:16 How much was the price of oil then, now & when this govt came into power in 2015? For how long was that high price sustained? You don’t have any barometer to measure the level of poverty you are claiming now exists. The abandoned projects littering the country are being completed
8399 2018-11-03 19:56:06 My bet is they are manipulating workers and families dependent on the oil and gas industry to vote against their own best interests. 

Short term gain of the promise of employment, only to have workers rights, labour standards and consumer protections eliminated
8400 2018-11-03 19:56:06 石油[タンク]︰an oil [tank]
8401 2018-11-03 19:55:56 It’s a place called oil bar off sugar loaf they mix oils you pick into a whipped shea mix it’s nice I did tobacco vanille and one million.
8402 2018-11-03 19:55:47 No, it's an Italian sandwich, with oil and vinegar, and lettuce has no place in the same zip code
8403 2018-11-03 19:55:46 Still use those expressions Laura “wasta born in a barn” “put wood in’t oil” !
8404 2018-11-03 19:55:33 Honestly give your best advice on oils. Mom is going through ovarian cancer chemo again and She doesn’t have Twitter but wants to know more. She has oil and likes it but, she high key wants more 
8405 2018-11-03 19:55:26 I use a teensy bit of hemp seed oil on my hair ends. I use it for everything, lol. I basically just walk around with a thin layer of hemp seed oil covering my entire body.
8406 2018-11-03 19:55:15 Haha lol 
Maybe he needs the Nazar repellent or the oil and water to remove the effect 
8407 2018-11-03 19:55:09 Why give oil waivers then? You don't believe in your own policy! PUSSYWHIPPED!!

8411 2018-11-03 19:54:43 Syria is another great example. 222 individual line items. $539M for emergency response. The US is in Syria to do one thing, remove Assad and install a dictator. It’s our playbook. Then Shell Oil and the Saudis get what they want. We will spend $1B this year there...
8412 2018-11-03 19:54:41 Paying 4+ dollars on gas per gallon is completely outrageous. Fuck all you bitch ass oil billionaires !!!! 
8413 2018-11-03 19:54:36 Great, will go to settle bill and place an order  thanks
8414 2018-11-03 19:54:23 One thing I’ll never understand is why restaurants will say something is vegetarian when it has fish flakes or fish oil in it (which happens way more frequently than you’d expect)
8415 2018-11-03 19:54:12 Who cares about oil, so far all its done is pollute and corrupt, its a good thing that we're getting away from it.
8416 2018-11-03 19:54:09 the Milk Blush Oil is like my favourite blush ever but once I run out I won’t be able to get more bc discontinued I’m sad @milkmakeup bring it back and ship to the UK

8422 2018-11-03 19:53:21 Ladies here’s a friendly reminder to drink lots of water, keep your PH balance in check and get an oil change, your oil light been on too long.

8429 2018-11-03 19:52:51 It's time. It's also time to redeem the values of what we stand for. Enough of being friends and allies with nations that share no values with us - just because of oil. Time to end this sacrifice of our values too.

Or are they just using unemployed oil workers to cement the deal?

8453 2018-11-03 19:50:44 @glowbiotics hi. After some advice please. How long would you expect an unopened sealed tube of the gel to oil cleanser to keep? I bought one nearly 2 years ago and have only just opened it. It seems a lot  runnier than I expected. Is that the texture or have I kept it too long?

8480 2018-11-03 19:47:56 You need to take an economy 101 class buddy.
If it was communist then all would receive the same, but women don't receive what men do and the workers don't receive what the rulers do.
There's 2 classes which means it's NOT communist.
Ruling class capitalize on hajj, oil.

longterm all of our energy will be harvested off planet. there's so damn much of it, that efficiency becomes regardless. on planet results all have some hiccup that keeps it from becoming the next great thing to oil.
8483 2018-11-03 19:47:28 "The waivers granted to these eight…show that the market needs Iran's oil and it cannot be pulled out of the market," Deputy #Iranian Oil Minister Ali Kardor was quoted by state TV as saying. #Iran
8484 2018-11-03 19:47:22 You bet. And it's dead simple. Just rub whole onions, skins intact with either butter or olive oil, sprinkle with salt. Make a smoke tray by using a cake pan or similar container with soaked hickory chips, bank charcoal around it, and put the onions over the chips on the grill.

8490 2018-11-03 19:46:40 Once again the article overstates the relationship between Qatar and Iran. UAE literally depends on its life on Qatar’s gas and Iran’s oil, so it’s relationship is far more significant.
8491 2018-11-03 19:46:35 Mate I remember when I broke my shoulder and couldn’t do anything. Was a nightmare. Get some CBD oil

8500 2018-11-03 19:45:15 That may possibly be bcos of lack of trust between the then FG and the governors, come to think of it under GEJ Nigeria made above $380 billion from sales of crude oil and also borrowed above $30billon, foreign reserve was depleted from above $40billion to 30 billion.

8506 2018-11-03 19:44:50 ED has been all out about discovery of oil. Surprisingly, he does nothing to resuscitate ZISCO  steel which is equally important. We are spending millions importing steel when we could be exporting.

8510 2018-11-03 19:44:03 Oil is the awesome sauce!
8511 2018-11-03 19:44:02 No, it's because a large part of their economy is based on oil and gas extraction, and they have an 84% tax rate on those companies.

Don't waste ur time on someone who doesn't understand anything about economy than "build money".

8543 2018-11-03 19:39:15 Take Quebec not developing O&G resources. It's a travesty that because they don't, AB and Sask fund equalization to tune of $11 billion. So Quebec basically gets invented to not produce but gets oil and gas money from Alberta its assinine

8554 2018-11-03 19:37:52 @Flora do you have any plans to remove palm oil from your spreads? Or to use sustainable palm oil?
8555 2018-11-03 19:37:50 10. So, remain observant because if Iran can not export its 3 million barrels per day, crude oil will rise in price, but if Iran, in retaliation, closes the Strait of Hormuz where 30% of the world's exported crude crosses, the price can be doubled or triple it fast.

It’s a week supply and includes our pain relief and 2 skin creams too
8559 2018-11-03 19:37:31 I didn't say invent oil. I said Canadian incentives r backwards. Take equalization. Poorer provinces have incentive NOT to develop their resources in order to maintain their low fiscal capacity and continue to feed at the trough.
8560 2018-11-03 19:37:28 Could be a grown ass dude too, one that rubs oil on his or her body while being a spoiling sob
8561 2018-11-03 19:37:27 Oh I read this one on the oil call but the one you shared was the fin tech bet.
8562 2018-11-03 19:37:12 Globally world EV market grows about 50% per annum or doubling time under 2 years. So I expect US to become net oil exporter by early 2020s with help from oil displaced by EVs.

8566 2018-11-03 19:36:54 Well I AM just thinking, with the oil in the Middle East being the Power grab, really surprised China is not doing more for Syria militarily to secure Syrian & Iranian oil.  China needs much oil... If China is shy Russia can retrieve oil ,mark up price & sell to China. Whatever.
8567 2018-11-03 19:36:50 Seriously, are you really being so pathetically paranoid and delusional that all you can do is pit the poor and oppressed against the more poor and oppressed while protecting the fascist goons you will poison us all for oil money? #GreedIsTheRealENEMY

If you want to look at the

8570 2018-11-03 19:36:03 Do u think BP enjoyed being in the spotlight for the disastrous oil spill in the Gulf? Do u think they enjoyed their fueling stations being boycotted? Do u think Toyota enjoyed a decrease in 10% sales over recalling faulty dangerous vehicles. Tiger Woods? U get the drift 
8571 2018-11-03 19:35:57 Bring it. Courts will tell you that congress (or states) defining documentation for immigration takes away no rights, and certainly not citizenship, that is granted by the constitution.

8578 2018-11-03 19:34:52 Do they mention that extracting this oil is a clean up in its self. Of course not.
8579 2018-11-03 19:34:52 75 mill to TAMU is like 20 bucks to us. Big oil money. As of the end of last year, it had a nearly $11 BILLION endowment. Interest of 1 percent on that is $100 million+.  And that endowment returns WELL more than 1% a year... Jimbo is one of 4 active head coaches w/ nat’l title.
8580 2018-11-03 19:34:50 Very good point. I try and frame my thought on Musk around “desperate people do desperate things X huge messiah complex = anything goes . Partner with Saudis, big oil, etc. Repudiating “no dealerships” mantra would be nothing to him.

8589 2018-11-03 19:33:49 Trump also violated the fort Laramie treaty & is invested in Phillips 66 KXL DAPL KM, now treasonous trump & oligarch oil masters bribe judges attempting to stop native Americans from voting. #NativeVotesMatter #EndVoterSuppression #NativeVote #BakkenGate
8590 2018-11-03 19:33:42 Greenfield-Central takes their place on Lucas Oil Field.  They are waiting to hear how they placed  in today’s state finals.  I’m a little biased, but I think the show was fantastic! 
8591 2018-11-03 19:33:38 شكرا على التوضيح .
أنت كما عهدناك والحمد لله .
8592 2018-11-03 19:33:32 Oh so they pulled out coz of risk of finding no oil? Thought the narrative was that RGM refused to partner with them. Glad some records still exist. Now if back in 93 they said the risk is high, wonder what Invictus is banking on by wishing to take this risk? Our money perhaps?
8593 2018-11-03 19:33:26 Aw...poor kiddo.
BTW, do you know anything about cat constipation? My fault cause the ten days was so sick didn't brush my bear cat--Shiraz. Ugh. Help. I am reading about olive oil, paw gel, oy.
8594 2018-11-03 19:33:18 I wonder if Russia will continue to sell oil for RMB when China goes through its certain substantial systemic collapse? 
8595 2018-11-03 19:33:18 i heard walking helps! or somebody said drink castor oil lmao im desperate at this point i gotta do something
8596 2018-11-03 19:33:10 Subsequent classes of people are prohibited simply through legislative action and not a substantive change in the amendment itself.

8598 2018-11-03 19:33:01 makeup remover
-mix 1/2 rosewater with 1/2 oil like jojoba/almond/argan for a gentle and non-irritating make up remover 

Eye treatment 
-soak cotton pads in rosewater and leave on eyes. It’ll cool your tired eyes, relieve redness and hydrate the eye area.
8599 2018-11-03 19:32:40 Dirty Oil money pays his wages though..
8600 2018-11-03 19:32:35 So what's the bigger takeaway? Why are the #Buckeyes still leaking oil? (especially defensively) Or the running game finally got it going? I'll hang up and listen.
8601 2018-11-03 19:32:25 "BP, bringing oil to US shores."
8602 2018-11-03 19:32:24 Why does no one hold Dubya accountable for his for-profit oil war anymore? You know he was responsible for Kavanaugh just 6 weeks ago. STOP acting like the GOP just got terrible in 2016. It's been brewing downhill since Reagan.
8603 2018-11-03 19:32:07 If it is oil u can eat it
8604 2018-11-03 19:32:02 Yeah honestly I Stan opaque lightly iridescent oil slick venom cum
8605 2018-11-03 19:32:02 I took your advice @ShannonNoelFord on @careofvitamins but now every time I burp my breath smells like fish oil. 
8606 2018-11-03 19:31:43 Who needs a section tonight? I need to make my money back from a oil change and brake job lol
8607 2018-11-03 19:31:41 It always takes a bit to remember that the burps smell like that because of the fish oil pills.
8608 2018-11-03 19:31:27 They not that super I guess lol. I change my own oil
8609 2018-11-03 19:31:18 Have you tried organic raw coconut oil and rose water?
8610 2018-11-03 19:31:16 แปลว่าปังจะไม่เซ็นเข้าค่ายไหนอีกแล้วใช่มั้ยอะ แงงงงงง คนดี
8611 2018-11-03 19:31:13 Can't complain about the result, still unbeaten. Time for academy team to salvage some points off the Oil Mafias.
8612 2018-11-03 19:31:08 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, yet powerful politicians.
8613 2018-11-03 19:31:02 Can’t be hard hearted and serve God that just don’t work thats like trying to mix oil and water
8614 2018-11-03 19:30:35 exactly. Back on my old Chevy equinox I learned to change my own oil. AutoZone always ran specials for like $35 full change with filters if you bundled a certain brand. People don't always know we have choices
8615 2018-11-03 19:30:31 Electoral reform law. I can put partisanship above science. Keystone XL oil pipeline, President Obama has swung behind a curtain.
8616 2018-11-03 19:30:30 Maybe you could irk someone’s oil?  Sounds easier.
8617 2018-11-03 19:30:27 Mate you talk so much shit  go oil ya bald head and kill some kittens or something
8618 2018-11-03 19:30:13 Probably not. The 2nd is not absolute even though plain language would indicate it is. Certain classes are excluded.
The same theory applies here as well though left would claim not.
8619 2018-11-03 19:30:08 Let me know if you find another I have removed and cleaned them and then coated them with olive oil and dusted them with sea salt and baked in the oven for about 10 minutes the check them and continue to cook until they are your desired crispness
8620 2018-11-03 19:30:07 The coastal communities in Asia and Africa take coconut oil in all forms yet they have few heart attack and cancer conditions... this campain against coconut is pure propangand by the west!
8621 2018-11-03 19:29:46 Some places I’m shocked they don’t route the oil drum straight into a floor drain. 

Some places they use biodegradable hand soap in the bathroom and neatly bag up and recycle everything.
8622 2018-11-03 19:29:40 sure once you stop complaining about seeing a cute girl and not going for it
8623 2018-11-03 19:29:33 Laying in my bed with my oil diffuser is the perfect way to spend a Saturday afternoon
8624 2018-11-03 19:29:23 my friend didn’t know you need oil changes and just drove her car on the same oil until it ended up totaling the engine...i....
8625 2018-11-03 19:29:13 They aren’t a supporter per say, but they have supported groups within Pakistan since at least the Soviet-Afghan War, more recently they have supported Pakistan to bleed the US, maybe with a long term eye on Afghan minerals, and especially gas and oil.
8626 2018-11-03 19:29:01 Cedar Oil Products are all made in the U.S.A by White Eagle Oyate Inc
8627 2018-11-03 19:28:52 There is an oil leak about 250 miles west of Tampa Bay.
8628 2018-11-03 19:28:48 #Venezuela quick question...how are you producing #oil when all your workers are starving to death? Can't wait till we see slower outputs... #oilprice @NicolasMaduro buy some #USD bro, save your people and country... #onelove 
8629 2018-11-03 19:28:41 China, alone, does not threaten USD hegemony. A rapidly accelerating multipolar currency regime does. Russia sells oil to China for RMB; S-400s to India for rubles; Germany sells cars for Euro; etc. The failed experiment of a single fiat global reserve currency is ending.
8630 2018-11-03 19:28:40 Take my car in for a $20 oil change and end up spending $400...yay
8631 2018-11-03 19:28:39 Ab kidr gaya ASAD UMER

Aaj ASAD UMER ko  ghareeb PAKISTANI nazar nhi a rha
8632 2018-11-03 19:28:24 yeaa still i might have to go GP n try get some oil lol
8633 2018-11-03 19:28:18 See, I prefer my hot rice and oil stew to any jollof rice. All the hype of jollof rice are lost to me. Abegy!
8634 2018-11-03 19:28:12 @PatiJinich S7E9.... wow, that lasagna and salad? ¡Delicioso! I WILL be making this soon after I’m ambulatory!! Think I’ll cut back a bit on the oil for roasting the veggies and add some lime juice on top of the salad... maybe a little cojita?
8635 2018-11-03 19:28:11 Just say yes! This is a fantastic example of you getting to choose how you use your personal data. Right now it is under valued and can buy a cup of coffee, soon your data could generate a passive income, potentially providing a type of UBI. Data is the new oil.
8636 2018-11-03 19:27:50 rt if your n*t taste like motor oil
8637 2018-11-03 19:27:40 Hi Kathy. Yes, Friday ended on a good note thank you.  Sounds like my morning.  mom's car for an oil change, two different stores for shopping, making her a big pot of soup that she wanted... And I don't want to get off the couch right now 
8638 2018-11-03 19:27:22 3/ ...including businessmen with petroleum interests, according to a copy of Zinke’s schedule."
There is so much corruption in this single AP article:
"Trump Jr also referred Beach to someone he knew from Saudi Arabia when Beach was working on a potential oil purchase...(con't)
8639 2018-11-03 19:27:12 Koch Bros businesses ingrained in Russia via their dad Fred. Major factors working with Putin’s mafia state (Mogilevich)to place/keep Trump. Trump exposed Tech scientists traitors $B (Mercer, Thiel, Schmidt) too! 

Corp corrupt wars 20th..21st land, oil, genocide-eugenics
8640 2018-11-03 19:27:05 Not the ROI the oil people had in mind.
8641 2018-11-03 19:27:04 You’re subsidizing oil and your health (and others) by burning oil. Don’t think it is all in the price you pay for gasoline. If take that into account, EV subsidies are nothing.
8642 2018-11-03 19:27:00 Why does Corbyn want Brexit? It's simple. If you want to sell your snake oil medicine (Marxism) you have to make people sick (Brexit).

It is the cause that purports to be the cure. #StopBrexit
8643 2018-11-03 19:26:58 My mum has rheumatoid arthritis and for cases like hers it gets rid of the inflammation and pain but I just asked will she bun it, but it's in oil form
8644 2018-11-03 19:26:39 After raising hell at Nissan, I walked out with a free oil change.

Assuming shit before you check my account will have you looking stupid. Don’t try that again 
8645 2018-11-03 19:26:35 Russia,Iran & Syria-Subject: Syrian income, think about putting oil wells back up & running. If terrorist attack wells, lots of smoke will enrage World to end the terrorism faster than anticipated. Russia will buy Syrian Oil as well as Iran. Making a new gas station for the World
8646 2018-11-03 19:26:18 Some of you are driving around with a check engine light, multiple oil leaks, bad engine mounts and a  broken flux capacitor. DM me. Let’s get those taken care of.  #wrenchesandpeaches

8648 2018-11-03 19:26:00 ...human rights abuses as carried out a multi National oil firm, ExxonMobil Nigeria. Such infraction of the law/justice by Mobil as relates
8649 2018-11-03 19:25:59 Which depends upon oil imports.
8650 2018-11-03 19:25:31 เดมมาสอบถามได้ค่า
8651 2018-11-03 19:25:26 Oil money and back handers?
8652 2018-11-03 19:25:24 Snake oil salesmen.
8653 2018-11-03 19:25:14 لاكااااااoil 
8654 2018-11-03 19:24:59 We do too. Luckily my car takes diesel and rarely needs an oil change. I complained my oil change took 4 hours and they gave me a free one
8655 2018-11-03 19:24:53 I agree with you that corruption and thedrop of oil price had a negative effect on the economy, but you can't just reject all the sanctions imposed by US to boycott and worsen the Venezuelan Economy.
8656 2018-11-03 19:24:44 what did big oil do anyway lol
8657 2018-11-03 19:24:41 Yes, people in other countries will all park their cars because they don't get oil from Canada.  That's a great climate plan, we are on a good path.

8659 2018-11-03 19:24:33 And the day went well, although i wanted to read something, but then started washing, washed all curtains, installed LED in dinning room, yap oil change of vehicle and a little ride on Kashmir highway and a cup of coffee from macdonalds 
8660 2018-11-03 19:24:30 Ian, the companies themselves fired 000's of energy workers when market oil price collapsed in 2014. The ND's/Lib's came to power in 15' & yes, the lack of new pipelines keeps Cdn price down, but new pipe takes years to build so blame for the lack belong to previous Con govt's.
8661 2018-11-03 19:24:25 My apartment is going to smell amazing in like 30 minutes thank you for oil diffusers
8662 2018-11-03 19:24:21 No. You need an amended to do that.
8663 2018-11-03 19:24:21 Truth! And if you add a menthol essential oil to it, it keeps you cleared up usually
8664 2018-11-03 19:24:20 It’s a beautiful day to get an oil change
8665 2018-11-03 19:24:15 Gotta get new tires, change my oil, and transmission fluid..

Oh the benefits of being a fuckin adult..
8666 2018-11-03 19:24:13 Peppermint oil and water in a spray bottle
8667 2018-11-03 19:24:07 I love how this coconut oil smells on me 
8668 2018-11-03 19:23:46 how can you drink that crap? It tastes like chainsaw oil.
8669 2018-11-03 19:23:36 oil change last month. got a new coat for winter last christmas. always had brows. I made that $40 this morning with one client & the latter is just guaranteed. 
8670 2018-11-03 19:23:30 Expected is not forced , and the way the pound is collapsing after Brexit and we leave taking our oil with us the Euro will probably be worth more .
8671 2018-11-03 19:23:21 Seems people want oil price to be fixed for next few centuries. World is praising leadership of our PM and peopke are worried about relationships with those countries that is dependent on India..
8672 2018-11-03 19:23:05 “Why augment tortilla chips with fried lasagna noodles that taste like nothing but oil?” asks @pete_wells in his review of @guysamericanbar #ditfoodwriting
8673 2018-11-03 19:23:01 They brought them in to us, the same way some took our dogonyaro to them and our cocoa and our coconut oil and our shea butter and our oil! We can do what they did to ours to theirs. It’s fair market! #TimeIsNow #WomenParticipate #ReformProbateLaws #CHANGE
8674 2018-11-03 19:23:00 In any case it should be reviewed by the court.
In this case I agree we should be more like all these European countries we are told to emulate. They dont allow it.
8675 2018-11-03 19:22:54 I take corn muffin mix, add a large spoonful of cornstarch to it, mix thoroughly, add water to make a thick batter then dip 1/4" slices in & fry. They're best fried in bacon drippings but olive oil & butter is nice, too. I love them but they are a short season thing. 
8676 2018-11-03 19:22:47 My dad filled my tank and took my car to get an oil Change 
8677 2018-11-03 19:22:38 Another uninformed, small (little) minded socialist idea perpetuated by foreign big oil. They thank you from the bottom of their bank accounts. I call it Hypocritical Traitorism.
8678 2018-11-03 19:22:35 Oh the wheels are falling off. And spewing grease and oil all over the place. #Sens in big trouble.
8679 2018-11-03 19:22:31 I recently had my manifolds changed on my Silverado. I now have a burning smell after they get hot? This a break in period smell or oil or something used during installation burning off?
8680 2018-11-03 19:22:21 I raise meat rabbits. I fry mine in peanut oil. Delicious.
8681 2018-11-03 19:22:09 Bait and switch. They gonna seen you need extra stuff and grip you. That price is for an oil change, none synthetic that also account for 4 quarts of oil and a filter that lasts for 3,000 miles. You need synthetic and a filter that lasts 10 - 15k miles. Don’t let them play you.
8682 2018-11-03 19:22:06 Shit even a VW oil change is about 60-80
8683 2018-11-03 19:22:06 Looks a very nice car. I bought a 125k 56 plate for my dad last year for £6,500 though, and they've dropped since then, (granted suspect not quite as nice as your one) so it's just a case of seeing where the market is at I think. Has it had gearbox oil changes?

In ‘98, trading, I brought $1/tonne CO2e onto the financial books of Ontario Hydro. Business case to convert Lennox on oil to natural gas went ahead & Lennox on gas often pushed Lakeview off margin, made coalphaseout feasible

8703 2018-11-03 19:19:23 For things that have had contents with volatile oil like thinners they should be left for a few days to completely evaporate it before being disposed of as non-flammable waste.

8707 2018-11-03 19:19:01 Both my cars would need an oil change at the same time

8709 2018-11-03 19:18:56 It is much more efficient to use electricity directly in trains, cars, buses and trucks. Planes perhaps but we are not running out of oil anytime soon so not worth the effort.

8712 2018-11-03 19:18:37 Such a laughable line of reasoning comparing tobacco to fossil fuels, as if cigarettes had some kind of utility - like providing 80% of all energy worldwide.

It's simple; if research conducted with funding from oil companies is tainted by definition then why accept any of it?

8720 2018-11-03 19:17:54 The car tells you what you need (tire rotation, oil, change, engine air filter, cabin air filter) you don’t pay for the initial cost of the vehicle. How expensive it is to buy is how expensive it is to maintain. You cant flex when broken down on the road.

8729 2018-11-03 19:16:46 Rick Bayless just told me on his TV show that I should start frying everything in avocado oil instead of olive oil and now I want to fight him. I'm not certain I've ever seen avocado oil. Pffft

8735 2018-11-03 19:15:52 Somebody in the #EuropeanCommission should have read @AndyBalmer's excellent book on the fundamental problems of all purported lie detection technologies. Some public servant has just wasted a lot of money on snake oil.

8737 2018-11-03 19:15:28 Actually, I think Rachel Notley's aggressively trying to get a pipeline built so the oil producers can sell their product at a much higher price to countries other than the US, which would boost the Alberta economy tremendously and pay for all the rich benefits Albertans want.
8738 2018-11-03 19:15:22 it's just regular coffee with an eyedropper of CBD oil in it. i'm not even sure if it will do anything because you're supposed to hold the oil under your tongue for a minute or two for it to absorb. but hey, maybe it'll take a little of the edge off.
8739 2018-11-03 19:15:08 I love pie crust, if done correctly! I make my own...oil pastry crust. Good stuff! (*if I say so myself) Hee!

8745 2018-11-03 19:14:32 Gotta go get a oil change tomorrow and I want to
8746 2018-11-03 19:14:28 I was given cbd oil recently for my severe anxiety but I’m scared to try it 
8747 2018-11-03 19:14:23 have you tried cbd oil? does wonders to help me focus its like Adderall but lit
8748 2018-11-03 19:14:18 I have a dog, the family dog. I have CDB oil, and tried for the first time yesterday to he me sleep. I need find people who do more out door stuff.
8749 2018-11-03 19:14:17 Idk if this has been mentioned but when shadow was having problems they gave us some oil type stuff, I cant remember the name just to make it easier & also recomended a water waterfall but since hes at the barn and there's hoses then that probs wouldn't matter but it's a thought
8750 2018-11-03 19:14:16 I feel like he has no need to cum so he just simulates it for Eddie, aka matching the mating ritual for humans. Personally I really like the idea his cum is black and slick and greasy like crude oil
8751 2018-11-03 19:14:10 This week has been awfully strange.

AIDS cure discovered. Then it wasn't.

RBZ governor fired. Then he wasn't.

Oil & gas discovered. Then it wasn't.

8752 2018-11-03 19:13:54 CBD oil, does it really work for insomnia or snake oil? I know it does work for other things, like for convulsions, but I’ve read it’s not good as a sleep aid. Tell me.
8753 2018-11-03 19:13:54 I’ve had chronic pain in my neck, back and shoulders for almost ten years. 
I’ve recently discovered peppermint essential oil really helps. Also mediation. Pain meds are a last resort. Hugs XoXoX
8754 2018-11-03 19:13:22 So what anti-dumping duties were you referring to with regards olive oil?
8755 2018-11-03 19:13:14 #Turkey and #Iraq said they have been told they would be granted #waivers, although U.S. officials did not immediately confirm those claims. #US #Iran #Sanctions #Oil
8756 2018-11-03 19:12:57 Thankful I have money to pay my bills and get my oil changed like a responsible adult. #gratitudemonth
8757 2018-11-03 19:12:35 First its illegal oil money, next actual doping (as Pep was doing in Barca it seems)
8758 2018-11-03 19:12:25 You fit so well into the Republican universe. Instead of being out helping people vote or raising money for the needy....you just sell your snake oil. How is that money going to help young black supporters? They give you money for a hat and get what? To meet the racist in the WH?
8759 2018-11-03 19:12:10 tell me why i took a shower last night & i still am finding oil paint on me 
8760 2018-11-03 19:12:07 mom told me she went for an oil change and they told her if she didn’t get her brakes done for $500 she would get into an accident as soon as she left. Mom went to a mechanic and he said they were fine, it’s been 5 years with the same brakes they said would “give out any second”
8761 2018-11-03 19:11:57 what kind of products!!! I've heard so many ppl say they use cbd oil based products for so many diff things and I've been so intrigued esp for my anxiety lol
8762 2018-11-03 19:11:27 The deficit for 2019 is projected to be a trillion dollars go do your research you will see deficit goes down under Democratic Leadership up under Republican it's that simple you're not going to hear Republicans talking about closing tax loopholes or ending oil subsidies.
8763 2018-11-03 19:11:26 How about a nice trim, keeping most of the length at the bottom, and some @BoomBeards oil? 
My beard has transformed into HEAVENLY with regular use of their delicious oils.

8767 2018-11-03 19:10:56 how about vaping? like using a wax pen or vaping thc oil?
8768 2018-11-03 19:10:48 5. Iran adds that if they can not export oil nobody in the Persian Gulf will be able to export either because they will close the Strait of Hormuz.
8769 2018-11-03 19:10:29 Prayer to the God of Oil? Because that’s the only God they know.....
8770 2018-11-03 19:10:27 In all this didn't the report note that there is more gas than oil??? That is why #Mobil at that time mobil pulled out
8771 2018-11-03 19:10:24 US cannot defeat IS. Now has to manipulate oil market, back more thugs. US tight oil crash looming. Desperation.

8774 2018-11-03 19:10:06 Hugely risky.  It is basically taking a massive one-way bet on oil prices.

8778 2018-11-03 19:09:50 Disposing of old chemicals is expensive! When you are running a place that charges $25 for an oil change, you cut corners wherever you can
8779 2018-11-03 19:09:46 oil
8780 2018-11-03 19:09:46 Smoke and mirrors. Borrow lots of money (the deficit), give money away (2017 tax reform) is all that I see. Snake oil is all this FAKE PRESIDENT is selling. Consumers / taxpayers pick up the tab.

8782 2018-11-03 19:09:26 CBD oil might help out with this.

8785 2018-11-03 19:09:11 Automation and tech has inevitably replaced many jobs. Exactly what kind of jobs are coming back? Low wage or min wage. Don't tell me coal. We need innovation. Jobs have been on the rise 4 past 5 yrs! Renewables growing which DT is penalizing. Oil friends.
8786 2018-11-03 19:08:58 Tell that to the hidden people who run it. Big oil 1%er organizations etc.
8787 2018-11-03 19:08:51 Very nice goal from lacazette , iwobi nice work
8788 2018-11-03 19:08:47 It would seem a superfluous inclusion, " subject to the jurisdiction," unless it had a specific meaning and intent at the time. Only an examination of legislative debate would clarify. Not first time understanding of a phrase diff than contemporary meaning
8789 2018-11-03 19:08:33 Specially by people who don't know nothing.
8790 2018-11-03 19:08:01 Is good.  All I’ve managed to create today was a diy watercolour sketchbook.  What is your medium, oil or acrylic?
8791 2018-11-03 19:08:01 My French soap has a subplot about rival organic olive growers sabotaging each other’s land, it’s like Dallas but with olive oil
8792 2018-11-03 19:07:52 There is a larger game being played out here. Trump’s pressure on Iran is not going to let up, but other nation’s desires for their oil is a great pressure. What this does accomplish is Iran being forced to sell their oil at a reduced price and that pressures others. Interesting.

8795 2018-11-03 19:07:26 Weird strategy by Nebraska's receivers to dip their gloves in baby oil at halftime, but here we are.
8796 2018-11-03 19:07:25 I use panko chips I like crushing is up more with my fingers before using it, one egg, diced bell pepper, onion and you can use the can salmon season to taste and fry in a little oil it shouldn’t even cover it
8797 2018-11-03 19:07:02 My cousin's housemates are always finishing her foodthey finished her fish fingers and oil she's always complaining shame this is why umuntu must live alone
8798 2018-11-03 19:06:57 For the last time YOU bought up the issue of corporate tax and tax avoidance, I AGREEDED and just pointed out that the issue was hardly unique to oil/gas and that every mulitnational does it but instead of a informed reply you choose to get offended, that’s your issue not mine
8799 2018-11-03 19:06:41 They really do just neutralize each other. What really sticks in my craw is having to see Rob McKenna all the time, described as a "consumer advocate," trying to convince people to continue to do nothing to address climate change while he is on the payroll of Big Oil.
8800 2018-11-03 19:06:39 It beats working at an oil rig the rest of your life.
8801 2018-11-03 19:06:36 Me : “Why is it so cold in our guest room?

Me: “We are in Minnesota, babe.”
8802 2018-11-03 19:06:36 Today when I parked @ Forte oil in Falomo to buy diesel, I left the door of the car open and someone stole ₦500 from the car  na wa!
8803 2018-11-03 19:06:28 What i am saying is this, the way this *potential oil* was announced beggars belief ,why, because the minister of mines was the rightful authority not the president. Then following day, the prospecting company makes a u-turn, it makes our duly elected president look like a joke.
8804 2018-11-03 19:06:17 Completely pushed up my oil pan and bent my subframe too  Oil pan wont be in till Tuesday  Kill me

#SaudiArabia Arabia adopts the renminbi for oil payments 
Germany changes its stripes and cozies up to #Russia and pretty much gives up on the whole Eu integration charade in order to  self-interest..
8806 2018-11-03 19:06:09 It’s always depressing watching an oil change place dump a 55 gallon barrel of used oil and coolant down a storm drain
8807 2018-11-03 19:05:55 I am craving Boiled white yam + red oil ( ogiri, utazzi, Cameroon pepper, nnu )  with dry fish packed by the side . 

A bottle of chilled Heineken to step down. 

Who will help me ??
8808 2018-11-03 19:05:46 Please stop echoing the self serving hyperbole from the oil industry. This is clearly nonsense. He does not speak for Canada.
8809 2018-11-03 19:05:41 It's also noteworthy that 3q14 was when Russia announced it would sell oil in CNY, & when China's SGEI opened, which effectively "reopened the Bretton Woods Gold window at a floating price thru CNY"
8810 2018-11-03 19:05:29 There's only one choice for Texas and that choice is @BetoORourke

8816 2018-11-03 19:04:43 Yes girl!!! I promise it works. You use the cotton ball to secure the olive oil inside your ear.

8821 2018-11-03 19:04:25 @LaBeautyologist something ive been wondering for a while, are moisturisers that are "mattifying" or "oil balancing" actually good for oily skin?
8822 2018-11-03 19:04:08 America has a huge supply of oil. It doesn't need the Middle East's, but our enemies do. By controlling the Middle East we can deprive our enemies war machines the life blood they need to oppose us. Oil is just a tool, but it's about power and control
8823 2018-11-03 19:04:08 You people must be very vigilant not to purchase anything connected to current slavery being so concerned as you are- you wouldn’t want to benefit from that slavery now would you? Fish, palm oil (in a million things including cosmetics) electronics, coffee, so many industries
8824 2018-11-03 19:04:06 Long story but a family friend I was trying to give some work too tore my shit up . He put a whole steering wheel column on my moms truck but he fucked up my simple oil change

8830 2018-11-03 19:03:14 You mean oil?
8831 2018-11-03 19:03:11 I’m @texrenfest today and I just bought black truffle infused olive oil. I’m very excited to cook with it, you guys.

8833 2018-11-03 19:02:39 The oil companies would leave. The place where the oil is.
8834 2018-11-03 19:02:32 It’s an astringent. Strips the skin. 
Part of the cleansing phase. Not nourishing. 

(No, oily skin doesn’t need to be “stripped” of oil. It needs HYDRATION so oil production can balance out.”

8840 2018-11-03 19:01:18 How far true is it that USA want to bomb Zimbabwe because they just found oil in their country?.
8841 2018-11-03 19:01:10 Wanting to destroy the oil and gas industry is like the tobacco industry. You want to phase it down every year as renewables grow until 2030.
8842 2018-11-03 19:00:58 I take (everywhere) antihistamines, tick removal tweezers, first aid kit, antiseptic wipes, tea tree oil, lavendar oil. When I travelled to Kenya on safari I took a sterile dressing kit.

8847 2018-11-03 19:00:10 Adam, i understand your frustration. I'm an independent now for a reason but the democratic party would not have stripped obamacare down to bones. It would not have cut funding for afterschool programs, etc. It would not have filled the EPA w chemical & oil lobbyists. SCOTUS?

8850 2018-11-03 18:59:56 Just think, about 350 years ago when #Warren only native ancestors entered her DNA, North America had a record heat wave, without #Democrats regulating coal, gas, or oil! Run toward @GOP
8851 2018-11-03 18:59:40 What song “potential oil find”? there no find as yet. Are you saying there is no potential at all? There are gold mines that didn’t make sense at $400.00 per ounce but $1,200.00 they are viable. You can just share and educate me without threatening...no one has all knowledge
8852 2018-11-03 18:59:35 One gallon of used motor oil can ruin approximately one million gallons of fresh water
8853 2018-11-03 18:59:33 Fresh fade & oil change time to get fresh and get in the streets.
8854 2018-11-03 18:59:32 It’s just a marketing ploy to sell her products that don’t work.  Yes, raise awareness but let’s not peddle snake oil or jade eggs...  I hope if she struggles with symptoms then she’ll take proper advice from a menopause specialist.
8855 2018-11-03 18:59:26 @TYTNetwork #OprahWinfrey Great that she's come out against the bad guys. Sadly, she has also often been a conduit for snake oil merchants. I still have to rate her below par. Hoping she'll dump Deepak and Dr Oz too :-/

8862 2018-11-03 18:57:57 With more expensive oil obviously that’s more expensive gas, fuel, roads etc. I always cringe when road prices escalate. That’s the absolute last thing CO needs.

8867 2018-11-03 18:57:07 I think 112 is tough to compare to Obamacare. Just two completely different entities. 112 may produce more jobs for the shear fact that a lot more directional boring procedures will be needed. The end game of 112 is more expensive oil...
8868 2018-11-03 18:56:56 I need to go get my oil changed, I just really don’t feel good 
8869 2018-11-03 18:56:56 Blair does the WCS just come from the oil sand. Is the oil pumped from south eastern Saskatchewan and Western Manitoba graded and priced differently?
8870 2018-11-03 18:56:55 True, but their fur fucks the cooling fan. Put a few drops of oil on a tissue or cotton pad and place it near the warmest part to intensify the smell. The cats should stay well away.
8871 2018-11-03 18:56:55 That's the messaging from the big oil companies that is not in fact, the facts. Look for information not affirmation.
8872 2018-11-03 18:56:45 For oil for stability in the middle east for fighting terrorism and if you are superior to mankind why do you keep interfering in our countries
8873 2018-11-03 18:56:36 I understand Gabby Asare Otchere-Darko is the new #god in Ghana oil and gas industry. When he sneeze, #AkerBP catches cold.
8874 2018-11-03 18:56:35 Most notably those who take foreign money to keep our oil landlocked
8875 2018-11-03 18:56:35 Except oil, that is.  That’s why we have this Invincible military.  The oil must flow, not only for us, but for the world. Dollar hegemony depends upon it, which is why we go to war with nations who try to buy oil, without using dollars.
8876 2018-11-03 18:56:30 I believe in helping others, I believe in the American worker, I believe in honesty, kindness and fighting for civil rights. I believe in helping the earth push back on mankind's polluting and poisoning. I believe we should not be anywhere in the world spilling blood for oil.
8877 2018-11-03 18:56:30 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
8878 2018-11-03 18:56:29 To firm breasts and tighten the skin, mix one teaspoon of vitamin E oil with one tablespoon of yogurt and an egg.
8879 2018-11-03 18:56:26 First apply Vaseline then use these ingredients on top:
1. Castor Oil 
2. Aloe Vera 
3. Vitamin E oil
4. Olive oil
5. Coconut Oil
Use an old mascara wand and a small bottle, Mix together then apply every night

8881 2018-11-03 18:55:53 Thanks to the stupidity of the Liberal government Canada has no competitive market for its oil.
8882 2018-11-03 18:55:49 Thanks Obama!!!! Actually, thanks GWBush as well. He opened up limited mining and oil in the west and Montana back in 2003. tRumpy ASSCLOWN had nothing to do with the economic resurgence in Montana.
8883 2018-11-03 18:55:39 @Totem_Wolf_Mcr Thanks for giving me a bottle of your beard oil in exchange for letting you in front of me in Aldi, it's a very nice product.
8884 2018-11-03 18:55:38 On Saturdays, yes. I typically wait 2 - 3 hours for an oil change.
8885 2018-11-03 18:55:28 Damn 
My 88 Tercel is only $18 for an oil change 
8886 2018-11-03 18:55:14 The USA is now the largest energy producer in the world, including oil.  Last I checked Perry is the Secretary of Energy.  This means cutting ridiculous regulations, etc.
8887 2018-11-03 18:55:13 @GOPChairwoman Democrats said GDP, manuf., coal, oil jobs, & other things making the economy good would not happen.  See no ads saying what they said would not happen showing it is happening. Who lied! They lied!
8888 2018-11-03 18:55:08 In Alaska a few years ago, a race that hinged on support of oil development in Bristol Bay -- a prime salmon spawning site -- was won by a coin flip. The man who won did not support the development.

8893 2018-11-03 18:55:02 Big Oil should be number 7 on this list, for their spending fighting the carbon tax initiative in Washington State.
8894 2018-11-03 18:54:42 Sunblock: Biore UV Aqua Rich Watery Essence SPF 50+ (if I want to put on foundation) / Biore UV Perfect Milk SPF 50+ (if I don't wanna wear makeup)
Makeup remover: Nutox Cleansing Oil

Note: I have dry skin.
8895 2018-11-03 18:54:41 Fatah ji, I understand your concern. But westerners are too dumb to differentiate between various brown people like Hindus, Sikhs & Muslims. Due to videos like this, they'll only end up attacking Hindus & Sikhs. Even the western state won't touch Muslims coz of Saudi oil money.

8922 2018-11-03 18:51:46 I tried cbd oil for the first time last night and experienced a completely calm and quiet mind for the 1st time in forever. I forgot what it felt like to not have underlying anxiety, anger, and depression and to constantly need to be distracted.
8923 2018-11-03 18:51:43 Spoken like a true Cult member.  You know you are ill and dangerous, right? Alex Jones wife knows, why don't you? He's an admitted "entertainer", nothing to do with truth--its all hyperbole and partisan plot to sell snake oil products. You're a gullible sucker. #Cult45 #bullies

8938 2018-11-03 18:49:57 Why? Coming from a fellow chronic pain sufferer: CBD oil does a better job, and it’s a lot harder to OD on. It has a lot fewer fatalities. There’s a reason they’ve cracked down on opioids. We need to focus on legalization of Marijuana, because it can help pain in natural form.
8939 2018-11-03 18:49:54 today i used oil to cook dinner and that doesn’t sound like a lot but it’s a big achievement for me and i’m so happy

8966 2018-11-03 18:46:17 No those are perfect. You just have to see how the hair responds..also tea tree should be used with a base oil like olive or avacado oil.

8968 2018-11-03 18:46:15 This is just ridiculous.  Middle Rastern countries are rolling in money from oil and gas.  We don’t need to be so opulent but we can at least have a decent contribution to minimise our daily expenses that make it difficult for struggling families such as lower power and petrol.

8998 2018-11-03 18:43:40 I actually just scooped some of each into a bowl  1 part coconut oil, 1 part pumpkin purée, and just a little bit of flax seed. I’d definitely say to use either cold pumpkin or cold coconut oil so it stays solid then put it in the fridge/freezer

9006 2018-11-03 18:42:17 By doing so Trump saved every economy which spends oil imports. Shows he is pragmatic.

9008 2018-11-03 18:42:08 rent paid, oil changed, tank full
9009 2018-11-03 18:41:57 The insults I got from my mom cuz she’s the one who had to pay the bill that was two years and up to this day she always tells me the same thing when I go for an oil change.
9010 2018-11-03 18:41:55 Oil .....No biggie let them go on strike
9011 2018-11-03 18:41:52 I don’t believe in God because God doesn’t believe in me! All tragedy is a farce! A farce...of farts! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
9012 2018-11-03 18:41:44 Sure, I just bought lemon vape oil from a strange cabbie. It's called living my best life.
9013 2018-11-03 18:41:34 let's say its 5%.  That's $250B/yr to float it.  Total USD FX rsvs (mostly EM) is $6-7T.  So at $250B/yr, EM's can sell FX rsvs & float the USD debt for ~24-28 yrs...IF they can get the ability to print domestic ccy for commodity imports, which is why CNY oil can be a gamechgr
9014 2018-11-03 18:41:34 HAHA i wrote someone up today for multiple oil leaks and like a thousand other things including broken wipers and they declined like why do people refuse to take care of their cars and then get mad when they have 100+ things wrong

9021 2018-11-03 18:40:28 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
9022 2018-11-03 18:40:28 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
9023 2018-11-03 18:40:20 My mom is currently checking my antifreeze and oil in my car and making sure it’s good to go for the winter. All while reminding me that “we don’t need men” 
9024 2018-11-03 18:40:19 @donlemon endorsing profiling?
9025 2018-11-03 18:40:18 ugh thats cute  my dad makes me get oil changes, and gives me a flat tire
9026 2018-11-03 18:40:05 おっぱいって結局は脂肪だろ？少し胸についてるからって僕を巨乳キャラにするなよ。
9027 2018-11-03 18:40:05 “What should we do with this flour and oil we over-cooked into a bitter sludge?”

“Just add some liquid and toss a bunch of crap in there to make a nasty stew. Someone’ll eat it.”
9028 2018-11-03 18:40:04 Throwback to when my mom used to try and make pad thai with glass noodles, broccoli, hamburger meat, uncooked peanuts, and an entire bottle of chili oil.
No other seasonings, just chili oil.
9029 2018-11-03 18:40:02 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund and the publisher of the National Enquirer. It has a mandate to support the oil companies and is working to introduce US style conservatism to Canada. It is propaganda, not news.
9030 2018-11-03 18:39:59 My oil changes are almost $100 cuz i dont have a regular fucking filter
9031 2018-11-03 18:39:50 Yeah it’s pretty much a ban on oil and gas. Moving forward
9032 2018-11-03 18:39:42 you know how silly rules are made because people do dumb things? can someone explain why they make it a point to mention that “missile-like objects” are not allowed at lucas oil stadium
9033 2018-11-03 18:39:39 Fox News Anchors know that when the President abolishes a crucial regulation, his staff wants to become politician

9039 2018-11-03 18:39:15 It is so hard to avoid palm oil products and often hidden under different names.
9040 2018-11-03 18:39:01 olive oil was spotted packing their bags bcs they're jobless now
9041 2018-11-03 18:38:55 Again ALL of oil and gas development is not just drilling. There are pipelines, flowlines, compression, plants that go into the whole process. Those would also have to adhere to 2500 ft setbacks. Not to mention that 112 gives local government the authority to push it further. So
9042 2018-11-03 18:38:52 there's officially no cooking oil in zim
9043 2018-11-03 18:38:46 People act like they for you think they slick like they oil

9051 2018-11-03 18:37:35 Is there a list of Palestian products, not controlled by Israelis,  that people can buy? Olive oil soap, spices etc?
9052 2018-11-03 18:37:33 Not sure 'creatures' count as animals, but I have ones called Shades. Small, hunched, skin slick like oil, all blind except the leader. They feed off any kind of life

9054 2018-11-03 18:37:14 US most likely allowing India to buy oil from Iran.
*sings aloud* Arrey bhaiya, oil is well...
9055 2018-11-03 18:37:13 The chaotic situation in Venezuela is partially US’s doing.   They want to crush the country’s economy completely before grabbing their oil with whatever way.

9057 2018-11-03 18:37:00 Wooooowww. Someone’s job is to search twitter for “oil change” and try to talk people into coming to a store that will most definitely be closed by the end of the year. I’m so sorry. Thoughts and prayers, Sears.

9076 2018-11-03 18:34:18 You are very popular in NY. You're the topic of conversation in ALL the offices of federal prosecutors and law enforcement agencies.
New York was on to the Trump con job decades ago. Go sell crazy snake oil to West Virginia.

9087 2018-11-03 18:33:24 Crushing grapes gives flavor to wine. Crushing olives gives us oil. The situations of life that you think are crushing you are actually yielding God’s flavor and oil in your life.

9091 2018-11-03 18:33:04 Yeap. Castor oil is super helpful with that. I'd stay away from tight ponytail holders or styles that pull her hair too tight. 

Once them edges are gone they are GONE
9092 2018-11-03 18:33:00 I get the oil
9093 2018-11-03 18:32:57 The so-called "roaring American economy" is but a manufactured Snake oil salesmen gimmick from Donald Trump & his Cultist Cabal Extremist Republicans. In another 18 months, the Donald Trump Hitler like economic growth will not last. Danger on the Horizon.

9105 2018-11-03 18:31:31 I’m in weld county yeah I live close to oil and gas production. If that’s the argument then why doesn’t 112 keep people from building 2500 guy from current oil and gas production?
9106 2018-11-03 18:31:30 Agree, but there is 1 geopolitical reality above all others that must be addressed 1st: If Russia, China, EU don't de-dollarize the commodity trade & esp oil, they will all go the way of the USSR, soon.  This is the most pressing threat to all & why they're wkg in same direction.
9107 2018-11-03 18:31:30 I'm canadian too. Where do you suggest they get the money from for these perfect world dreams of yours? Trudope is giving money we don't have to countries on the other side of the planet. With no pipeline for Alberta to actually get market price for their oil, we're tapped out

Aunt calls telling me my mom left already and I bum rush my ass to the mechanic. I still beat her to him.  MOM!!LOL
9120 2018-11-03 18:30:03 Not quite sure how it’s Trump’s fault that oil companies have had these catastrophic spills, but every time you drive your car you can congratulate yourself for being a hypocrite.

9127 2018-11-03 18:29:28 You do realize 112 is a 2500 ft setback on ALL oil and gas development not just drilling correct. If you can not put in a transportation system in to deliver the product why even drill? It goes from the well to a plant to your home. And when you keep saying the industry
9128 2018-11-03 18:29:22 Not really, China needs import crude oil.
9129 2018-11-03 18:29:19 Can I argue the Govt has save 000’s crores by eliminating subsidies on oil, urea etc and plugging leakages thru DBT. Cost of the  statute a small fraction of state GDP and hence won’t make a big dent to the state/ center welfare programs.

9138 2018-11-03 18:28:24 That’s what happens when pharmaceutical companies are allowed to buy off politicians. 

A lot of people talk about the GOP being bought by big oil(they are)

But the Dems are bought and paid by insurance/banking/ and pharmaceutical companies. It’s a pretty dark thing for both
9139 2018-11-03 18:28:21 Kinda depends, in our neck of the woods pre-2014 there were plenty of 20-somethings working in the oil patch making at least that much. Few, if any, had as low a burn rate as $30-40k/yr though. 
9140 2018-11-03 18:28:20 oil changes - fuel filters - spark plugs  - brake materials last longer by regenerative braking  -  had my 1 year inspection for my VW eGolf  -  1 hr labour at shop rate  to plug in - check battery state  and inspect mechanical components -  EVs are great

9143 2018-11-03 18:28:11 There’s plenty of money in conflict and oil steps it up a gear. The US has a much larger budget for looking after its own interests. Venezuela is a case in point.

Apply castor oil to your eyelashes at night to help them grow longer and thicker, use a clean q-tip and put the oil along your lash line

9151 2018-11-03 18:27:17  Soft Lips 
Exfoliate your lips before easing to bed and then, apply your favorite lip balm or a nourishing oil (Olive, coconut or almond oil)
9152 2018-11-03 18:27:01 It's not an enumerated right. You're not the first to falsely state this.
Next you will be claiming Hondurans have Constitutional right to migrate here.

9155 2018-11-03 18:26:57 I was on this train.  At one point, the conductor talked about hydroplaning/rain/oil from leaves and then says “this is a recipe for disaster”.  #NJTRANSIT
9156 2018-11-03 18:26:47 Virginia is permafucked all because of NoVA. This state will vote forever Dem because of them. Then they send their kids to the rural schools like VT to ruin the political scene there. As a proud Hokie, it pains me to see this area overrun with progressive.
9157 2018-11-03 18:26:47 I tweet this every time, but there is something about changing my car oil that makes me feel so good.
9158 2018-11-03 18:26:43 Someday you'll grow up & not cut down trees 4 ur diapers(we grew up with cloth aka reusable) you'll look back thankful some old schmuk took the time to tell u it ain't all raw sewage,foreign oil,& out of stock weed here in maple syrup land & don't colour outside the lines.

9160 2018-11-03 18:26:33 Other goods, like apples, can be continued to be produced, but they have to be produced in a way that doesn't use up goods like oil and carbon sinks.
9161 2018-11-03 18:26:31 Big polluters must do their part too. It’s unfair to blame one sector ex ag, oil and gas, personal vehicles. All have contributed. 2/2
9162 2018-11-03 18:26:31 Just spoke to an undecided voter; told him I support @katieporteroc because she doesn’t take Big Oil money and I care about the env’t; after that he said he was leaning towards her. #wedgeissue #GOTV @350action

9164 2018-11-03 18:26:14 hi mom can you come get me they just asked if i’ve ever rubbed baby oil on my naked body and slipped across the room like a penguin
9165 2018-11-03 18:26:12 There needs to be a total reduction in the kinds of goods like oil that are fixed, declining, extractive and polluting, and the use of kinds of goods like 'sinks', need to be reduced to within tolerable levels.
9166 2018-11-03 18:26:11 It's deeper the MSM has ties to the CIA. 
The Fed is unconstitutional body that controls the economy. 
Military Industrial complex. 
Arms and oil 
Do you ever wonder how many wave elections MItch, Chuck and Nancy go nowhere?
9167 2018-11-03 18:25:57 US pushes ahead with Iran oil sanctions but grants waivers to 8 countries
Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, did not say which eight countries would be exempted from the waivers but they are believed to be US allies like India, Japan, Italy, and South Korea--The Telegraph
9168 2018-11-03 18:25:51 Crushing grapes gives flavor to wine. Crushing olives gives us oil. The situations of life that you think are crushing you are actually yielding God’s flavor and oil in your life.
9169 2018-11-03 18:25:51 If it's in your carry-on, yes.
9170 2018-11-03 18:25:43 Why do guys keep tweeting about girls needing oil changes??? Who doesn’t get regular oil changes? Like is that a thing?
9171 2018-11-03 18:25:25 Just taught an elderly man how to smoke oil and he was so amazed by it. Love my job
9172 2018-11-03 18:25:24 Take to Ms. Aguilar about essential oils. They have essential oil bracelets that you can wear. 

Aside from helping with anxiety. I know there’s a certain mixture that helps with focus and concentration.
9173 2018-11-03 18:25:24 But even more worrisome are what are called 'stocks and sinks'--a 'sink' is how much the global ecosystem can tolerate a shock, for example, CO2 emissions. We can think of 'sinks' as a semi-fixed resource, kind of like oil.
9174 2018-11-03 18:25:10 1.- The oil from Campeche Mexico. Most bigger from all land... 2.- The new channel from Nicaragua. $ 1000.oo TRILLONES CAWSH FROM BEING FREE LAND FLOWERS, AMAPOLA AND hEROINA...

9176 2018-11-03 18:24:53 Is this woman dense!? We need a government that deals with such utter stupidity and a Party that openly condemns paedophilia and paedophiles. We need the longest & harshest sentences for such crimes. Preferably life incarceration on a North Sea Supermax on an abandoned oil rig.
9177 2018-11-03 18:24:37 Another problem is that some goods are like apples--they're used up when consumed, but within limits, are reproducible. Others, like oil, are not reproducible, they're fixed.
9178 2018-11-03 18:24:36 more so for the US than OPEC.   part of what has made the US a swing supplier in a sense (production stopped growing when oil in 40s)
9179 2018-11-03 18:24:34 Even with oil my hair takes 20 minutes to brush out
9180 2018-11-03 18:24:24 To make healthy choices for using new oven invest in sturdy sheet pan and oven roast your vegetables. We can eat while heads of cauliflower and bunches of broccolini etc drizzled w bit olive oil plus seasonings. Chic thighs or fish same pan for complete meal. Tons recipes on line
9181 2018-11-03 18:24:23 Painting with oil paint in a small contained space with no ventilation is a power move

9185 2018-11-03 18:23:41 You're going to have to change her moisturizer something fluffier and some light oil. Google the LOC Method. 

As a father as wrapping her hair at night :
Braid her hair into 2-4 pig tails at night and throw a silk scarf on.

9187 2018-11-03 18:23:17 My neighbour (now 15) called fireworks ‘bangworkings’ and my daughter ( now 13) used to insert the letter’h’ into words so we had hoven (oven) TriHangle ( triangle) Heggs (eggs) Hoil (oil) no idea why and we still use her words now !
9188 2018-11-03 18:23:15 Mumbai police not taking action against Touts in Sobo(Colaba).Approach foreigners with plea no money give food.Take foreigner to Sahakhari Bandar (opp. Regal Cinema)and buy rice,ghee,oil to the tune of 2000/3000.Same sold to shop keepers at a 300/400 discount.
9189 2018-11-03 18:23:03 The bottom line is locally we don't have the technical & financial capacity to explore for oil & gas for a bankable outcome.

9192 2018-11-03 18:22:28 It a perfect day for building oil derricks at the Fossils to Fuel training today! OERB - Oklahoma Energy Resources Board
9193 2018-11-03 18:22:16 I Don’t Think I Really Need This Oil Change. It Ain’t Worth It 
9194 2018-11-03 18:22:14 Chatting w/ one of my besties, we realized that America has been at war most of our lives. Essentially just for oil claims. Billions wasted; so many dead. Imagine if we had put that energy and money towards renewable energy. But no, we had to kill for a fucking limited resource
9195 2018-11-03 18:22:02 Ayer en GO! mi novio perdió el celular era un J5 dorado con funda transparente y la billetera negra que decía motor oil adentro tenía el carnet de la obra social ,el documento y la tarjeta del banco . Por favor si alguien sabe algo o los encontró que me avise,es muy importante
9196 2018-11-03 18:21:59 Hahah keep the dream alive, Oliver, that I'm gonna give you this bowl of pesto sauce and olive oil to eat.
9197 2018-11-03 18:21:51 "More critically, the emission level is only two per cent less than in 2007, putting the province a long way from its original legislated target of reducing emissions 33 per cent by 2020 over 2007.

Mining and upstream oil and gas production are the biggest single contributor"
9198 2018-11-03 18:21:49 I find it puzzling that when this “boom” came upon us, the Government did not look the benefits from oil money and set up a Wealth fund like Norway. I guess they thought the drunken sailor plan was better ?

9203 2018-11-03 18:21:09 Just had the worst conch snack just now, my stomach was upset before I even put it to my mouth. The oil smelled old and the conch and the oil combined tasted old. What a waste.
9204 2018-11-03 18:21:07 ギャーーーーーーーーーーー？！？！？！？！？！？！？！？
9205 2018-11-03 18:20:57 My prayer is that due diligence be made. Oil or no oil please remember the Chiadzwa mistakes.
9206 2018-11-03 18:20:56 strong dollar for ex has weighed on non-petrol exports, but not petrol exports, as that is a function of changing trade dynamics (US has some extra refining capacity for heavy) and rising US production so US increasingly both imports and exports oil

9209 2018-11-03 18:20:05 Remember when people were using coconut oil as lube? Like wtf is wrong with you...
9210 2018-11-03 18:20:02 production levels in the US have moved with the oil price.  higher oil price equaled more production in 17/18.  still think that the variables that explain the petrol balance are different than the variables that explain the non-petrol balance, so should model separately
9211 2018-11-03 18:19:50 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
9212 2018-11-03 18:19:40 why the urgency ?  time running out ?  need to get a payout from investments before oil is shunned by society and markets shrink  - company is turning a profit as things are atm -  where is the urgency?  shareholders want more ?
9213 2018-11-03 18:19:38 What's the problem with muscle milk and olive oil?

9216 2018-11-03 18:19:11 Really got  oil on my new pants
9217 2018-11-03 18:19:11 The truth is that any serious candidate should be telling us how to drastically reduce our dependance on oil revenue, not worsening the situation
9218 2018-11-03 18:19:10 There was a lady a few weeks ago that said farmers didn’t need oil we could just get things that plug in!
9219 2018-11-03 18:19:01 It contributes less to climate change and carbon in the atmosphere than coal and arguably oil too
9220 2018-11-03 18:19:00 I use “just for me” curl smoother and oil moisturizer. Sometimes i put leave in conditioning cream by Cantu. Naw i don’t wrap her hair at night

9227 2018-11-03 18:18:40 100$ to any girl that has a current oil change . 
9228 2018-11-03 18:18:32 Oh yeah, getting a bulk deal on olive oil, sage, cinnamon, and creosote. He's great.
9229 2018-11-03 18:18:05 hehe guess who just got their oil changed (;
9230 2018-11-03 18:18:00 I came outside to get my oil changed and drove to the nail salon. Fuck responsibilities today. And I’m not doing my homework or cleaning. Fuck everything.
9231 2018-11-03 18:17:52 will see this fall I think that oil also has its own price dynamics -- import price now is in high 50s/ 60.  should rise further.
9232 2018-11-03 18:17:24 yes.   has its own dynamic, which is a function of the oil price rather than than the dollar.    and there is nothing intrinsic in the rise in oil production that says it has to be accompanied by a deterioration in the non-oil balance
9233 2018-11-03 18:17:15 "No, Mobil called and said they're moving towards black! Just wait, you'll see next time you get an oil change!"

9240 2018-11-03 18:16:28 I washed my car & I’m getting my oil changed. Somebody give me a medal 
9241 2018-11-03 18:16:24 Walnut and yellow heart. Those are their natural colors and I can’t wait to see them when it’s time to apply the oil
9242 2018-11-03 18:16:20 We have an excellent view of the local fireworks at ours. Waiting for them to begin before I start the Strictly stir fry. I know I will trigger them if I go and oil the wok. Just looked over and we seem to be at that stage of men striding about officiously in high vis.
9243 2018-11-03 18:16:18 Im curious, what do you pay for an oil change?
9244 2018-11-03 18:16:10 oil  metals, USD
9245 2018-11-03 18:16:08 Go nab some Oil of Oregano and chug it down with some water.
9246 2018-11-03 18:16:01 if my car don’t have a oil change by tomorrow ima beat him tf up period
9247 2018-11-03 18:16:01 You'd rather it was opened before all the mandatory safety audits were carried out. The people of Aberdeen have been waiting for this since oil was first found in the north sea, a couple more months is not going to make much difference.
9248 2018-11-03 18:15:40 Olive oil
9249 2018-11-03 18:15:26 Cenovus bet the farm on demand for (low API gravity) bitumen. Meanwhile, technology emerged to hydrofracture horizontal wells in tight shaly reservoirs full of high API gravity light oil. It’s not the biggest problem facing Canadians to bail out Cenovus! Market forces must rule!
9250 2018-11-03 18:15:24 If there was oil there we'd have ppl living on it.
9251 2018-11-03 18:15:15 Hello go and change your oil lol, I change mine like clock work! Now I don’t worry so much cuz I get it done every 15k miles

9254 2018-11-03 18:15:06 This is the result of false, and or, not reporting the full facts on the subject.
With the return to 2005 sanctions, they are setting up 8 countries to purchase oil. The cash goes offshore, and the proceeds can only purchase Humanitarian aid for the people!

9256 2018-11-03 18:14:49 I'm so confused by the "women don't check anything in their cars before they drive them" narrative. Do men really check their oil every single day?
9257 2018-11-03 18:14:45 It's all for votes. He's gonna crush the US oil industry
9258 2018-11-03 18:14:40 I should be ashamed of myself for going this long without an oil change. This shit just ran me $80
9259 2018-11-03 18:14:31 I have to get an oil change and I’m so out the way.
9260 2018-11-03 18:14:22 The Pixi Rose Oil Blend facial oil has legit changed my skin  Aaaaaand a very close second would be the Coral Obsessions eyeshadow palette by Huda - I’ve worn it almost every day since buying it!
9261 2018-11-03 18:13:59 seems like a great move. 

my only concern is we are already polluting the rivers by throwing industrial and residential effluents into it. this may increase the rate of polluting the river (plus risk of oil spills, etc)

obviously air pollution will be cut off heavily. still..
9262 2018-11-03 18:13:56 Full tank of gas and getting an oil change

Who will sanction America? #Iran #SaudiArabia #Egypt #Iran #Afghanistan #Panama
9267 2018-11-03 18:13:28 And also an elimination of capital as a social relation AND concretely as fixed heavy industrial production (think oil refineries, arms factories, etc.). This part is generally less controversial to people when stated this way.
9268 2018-11-03 18:13:28 Labour not wanting to let SF away with the anti Israeli policy.....How about calling for a boycott of Saudi oil because of their actions in Yemen....

9279 2018-11-03 18:12:16 The idea is that to get to a truly renewable and sustainable level of living requires not just a relative but an absolute reduction in the use and waste of the above, and an end to extractive processes generally (think oil drilling or strip mining).

9282 2018-11-03 18:11:51 Yeah, got a good tip from @TheOperaGeek, and invested in some better wraps and salves and stuff. Now I smell like olive oil and cinnamon. Or I think I do. Nose jobs don't actually restore your sense of smell, y'know?

Hey @TheCinderKing, do I smell like olive oil and cinnamon?

9287 2018-11-03 18:11:33 Caught the end of an interview on #marian with an Irish oil company exec. From what I heard it was a very soft soap interview and he was allowed to push anti-environmental messaging with no challenge
9288 2018-11-03 18:11:26 I hit my shit with a basic cleanser first then usually some typea deep poor scrub finish with a lil coconut oil/witchazel combo lmaoo

9296 2018-11-03 18:11:00 Nagtry ako ng grape seed oil. 10 days lang. Tingnan natin if may epekto. Kc napitikan pa din ako sa garlic eh.
9297 2018-11-03 18:10:56 Made my own body oil last night & honey its amazing 
9298 2018-11-03 18:10:54 This cookie should be kicking in any minute now. I can feel the tingles on my head. 
This batch was made with three g’s of oil. I can only eat about a half cookie at a time. I made them way too strong.
9299 2018-11-03 18:10:47 That is actually crazy. I didn’t know it was THAT bad. I just know when I go they come into the waiting area at least three times to tell me something is broken and my car is about to die if I don’t buy it. I’ve even told them to stop asking me about anything besides the oil lol
9300 2018-11-03 18:10:26 Liverpool are miles behind the team the bent Oil merchants are lets be real. I know Sky and many are desperate for a title race but lets have it right Liverpool are miles short of that level. City cruised past this lot on this ground, Liverpool look shit.

9316 2018-11-03 18:09:11 Yeah, that's always the case with social media. If people want to monetize their audience and sell their snake oil to whomever will buy it, so be it. But it bugs me when journalists frame this as some bigger "back-to-the-land" movement when it's really just the same old hustle.

9324 2018-11-03 18:07:39 And notice how the "US is now No. 1 oil producer" story barely registered in Sept, as compared with the gazillion stories back in 2012 about how we were going to become No. 1.

9326 2018-11-03 18:07:38 I’ve been following you for awhile and I think your pivot method is very interesting and accurate. I know you do gold, oil and the indices.

9328 2018-11-03 18:07:22 Selling oil/gas in EUR (& CNY & USD) places control of Russia’s monetary destiny firmly in Russia’s hands.

Selling oil in multiple currencies shifts oil’s reference point back to gold for the first time in 47 years.  Russia’s been buying gold & dumping UST...

9423 2018-11-03 17:55:35 Why this allowing business? Why can't we say that we will import oil from Iran,for we need it,dare to stop if you can.when will our narrative change?. Its all abt saying once and realising our strength.
9424 2018-11-03 17:55:32 Conservatives live in the past-that’s why we can’t have advanced science -preservation of national parks -all they care about is oil & a few billionaires
9425 2018-11-03 17:55:30 As long as you still have oil when He comes.
9426 2018-11-03 17:55:18 Canadians understand hypocrisy when they see it, some are appalled and some too absorbed in the cost of living to respond. The truth is, there are too many Quebec and East Coast Liberal elites masquerading as environmentalists benefiting from the importation of Arabian &  oil.

9429 2018-11-03 17:54:43 That's right they were foolish virgins they didn't have enough Holy Spirit enough oil they ran out that means they back slid they were not living for the Lord therefore they were not taken they were left behind!
9430 2018-11-03 17:54:22 I really heated when they say we are a Nation addicted to Oil. If I could get away with putting Water in my tank. I would do it in a heartbeat!
9431 2018-11-03 17:54:17 I feel like such a boss B when I get things done. Oil changed, tires rotated/balanced. Bills paid. Splurged a little bit on Fall shoes but guess what, still got money in my savings. Okurrrr
9432 2018-11-03 17:54:10 I would say “why did you slaughter innocents with drones? Why did you reauthorize hate in the guise of 9/11 policies? Why did you sacrifice Syria and Yemen for oil? Why didn’t you stop deportations? Why didn’t you prosecute the banksters?”
9433 2018-11-03 17:53:53 Getting my oil changed on Monday or Tuesday cus too many ppl at the shop today 
9434 2018-11-03 17:53:43 nah, prob some pogba issues etc, but nothing like the oil clubs
9435 2018-11-03 17:53:36 Venezuela, the country with largest reserves of crude oil in the world, may run out of petrol and diesel in a week or so. Reason: Politicians destroyed the country’s oil industry by milking it to death.
9436 2018-11-03 17:53:04 A lot of snake oil for sale
9437 2018-11-03 17:52:57 Looking to keep seat in race with Allred... * Energy Department says US is now top oil producer... 11.3 million barrels a day, in August... 4% increase over old record in July... Russia: 62.14, Saudi Arabia: 10.4 million... highest since 1973...

9444 2018-11-03 17:51:58 I do believe the oil refers to the Holy Spirit. But the foolish have oil in their lamps, because their lamps are going out around midnight. So, they have the Holy Spirit to begin with. If they imagined they could need it, wouldn’t they have brought more oil and been wise? 
9445 2018-11-03 17:51:50 My dad made me call to set up an appointment for an oil change for my car but I ended up having to pass the phone off to him because they were asking questions I didn't know how to answer so I don't know what the point of me making the call was
9446 2018-11-03 17:51:48 I like vaping but we don’t even know what the effects of vape will be down the line. Do you know the different chemicals they use to extract the thc in order to make the oil for vape cartridges? I do cause I’m in the industry.
9447 2018-11-03 17:51:46 She’s a retired teacher, & legitimately believes that coconut oil, shiitake mushroom tincture, and CBD can cure HIV?! It surprises me b/c to be a teacher, she had to have gone through post-secondary education & learned basic biology - she *should* know that’s wrong, but doesn’t!
9448 2018-11-03 17:51:40 What would they do for a Diesel though? Give them some sort of special diesel oil? Treat the occasion like taking your friends out to the bar for a drink?
9449 2018-11-03 17:51:38 let not deceive ourselve the only sector impacting on our economy was the oil sector the other sectors was import dependent and that was while they crash immediately oil price crash
9450 2018-11-03 17:51:26 No just a little over an hour. Without giving too much away a heist that involves an oil wagon.
9451 2018-11-03 17:51:21 I agree with that. But, they were also calling for $200 oil just before the collapse.
9452 2018-11-03 17:51:12 I was supposed to change my oil today but I’m too hungover
9453 2018-11-03 17:50:50 I put thicker oil, when it was more convenient for me to put thinner oil since it’s getting cold.
9454 2018-11-03 17:50:46 They are also paying their debts to Russia and China in oil
9455 2018-11-03 17:50:44 I am not saying it should be followed constantly. Once electric cars become widespread it will be allowed. Or exemptions will be allowed if a person uses electric car, Odd-Even formula will not be applicable to them. It will also reduce oil import plus pollution.

9465 2018-11-03 17:48:58 You  are delusional. With the current wave of anti oil it is only a matter of time before we are a huge ghost town. Except for tech people and beristas to serve them their coffee.
9466 2018-11-03 17:48:43 Well you can’t very well have Venezuela profiting from all that oil they’re sitting on now could you ?
9467 2018-11-03 17:48:43 And a certain oil company.
9468 2018-11-03 17:48:43 I hate these kind of shock statements though. “It also contains a chemical liquid used in oil drilling that has been know to cause many deaths in humans.” You know, water.
9469 2018-11-03 17:48:33 Sorry, I’ve been out of twitter for some time as we’ve been super busy working towards the beta of Druidstone. Revamping the ability system is one of the highlights which has required me to burn some midnight oil. It nicely binds equipment and abilities under the same system.

9475 2018-11-03 17:48:14 I am holding off on trying the CBD oil, till there is more data on interaction with pharmaceuticals. I am on a lot of medication.
9476 2018-11-03 17:48:13 Hi, so it’s been almost two weeks since you’ve had the CBD Oil, I don’t smoke, so please what am I supposed to do ?
9477 2018-11-03 17:48:08 To me MMT could be like "oil curse"  money from heaven can be spent wastefully. Can we just tax anything, anyone, everyone at 20 percent so they feel vested in how money spent and then rebate most it services, cash as needed. So we get adv. of MMT and spend wisely.

I didn’t vote republican, I just gave it to the 3rd party running. Wasted vote? Sure, but no candidate is entitled to my vote based on party alone.

9481 2018-11-03 17:47:26 Apply it just all over, try leaving it on for at least an hour, even overnight. Just make sure to use unrefined coconut oil
9482 2018-11-03 17:47:25 I sometimes have to do sugar scrubs multiple times a day to get rid of the layers of dry skin... And always always follow with hella moisturizer. Also you can make your own sugar scrub with olive oil and sugar at home if you're ever out!

9485 2018-11-03 17:47:12 Maybe they can use that BP oil spill money that was stolen from Mobile and Baldwin counties to pay for those roads

9487 2018-11-03 17:47:06 Oi there! The logo of the Megagigant Oil company in the back of the shirt, though   I know oil and mining companies  give money to try to offset the PR damage and NGOs can use any money they can get, but still feels like a thorn in the  of the planet 
9488 2018-11-03 17:47:03 The ever changing vagaries of oil and gas jobs in Texas are gonna compete soon with the vagaries of jobs for first responders, insurance agents, disaster mitigation experts, and (re)construction crews. 
Wonder why? 
9489 2018-11-03 17:46:54 Well the foolish virgins these are lukewarm church people in lukewarm churches they don't live for Jesus In this passage the oil represents the Holy Spirit they don't have the Holy Spirit many churches don't have the Holy Spirit the churches are lukewarm no oil no Holy Spirit
9490 2018-11-03 17:46:53 They were sent to the Brazilian coast where the financier of the dem party and nazi conspirator soros had a 380 million dollar investment in a deep water oil field there
9491 2018-11-03 17:46:49 I don't believe that oil changes are worth 86 dollars.
9492 2018-11-03 17:46:46 My last game their to watch the Oil, the Oil won 3-1, I just hope they do t let their foot off the gas!
9493 2018-11-03 17:46:38 I should probably change my oil today
9494 2018-11-03 17:46:21 is oil kink a thing
9495 2018-11-03 17:46:19 On my way. Would have been there sooner but my oil change took 2 hours.
9496 2018-11-03 17:46:17 Looking forward, I would like to see a feature on advanced nuclear reactors with the emphasis on nuclear waste destruction and the production of carbon-neutral fuels for transport. This would move us away from fossil fuels whilst reusing most of the current oil infrastructure.

9501 2018-11-03 17:45:27 I know the facts you seem to be lacking in them I also know that after the no oil disaster he put a six month moritoriam on deep drilling for oil in the gulf and then all of a sudden extended it indefinitely I also know they are leased rigs and I also know that ...

9505 2018-11-03 17:45:12 So my mama used to be a part if this pyramid scheme that sold tea tree oil can called it some type of healing bullshit name.

9508 2018-11-03 17:44:58 14 African countries can't adjust their currency to their needs. Can't strengthen it to cheapen imports, can't devaluate to cheapen exports, can't adapt to the fluctuation of oil prices, can't hold or manage foreign currency reserves, can’t deal with the stock market.
Know why?

If we are not careful and be patient like Rwanda,Ghana etc e go hard us o
9511 2018-11-03 17:44:38 Yeah, and we want to keep it that way. Thats why oil companies have spent almost $8 million to stop Measure G. North and Southeast County are potential future fracking sites.

9514 2018-11-03 17:44:03 I’m pretty sure we share technology with other countries. But this would be a game changer, not just for the environment but also the political landscape. The Saudis can chop off all the fingers they want, we could just say fuck off to them and their oil
9515 2018-11-03 17:44:02 God is good y’all, I feel like I’m getting myself together
9516 2018-11-03 17:44:01 Yes. Believe deep capital markets, technical expertise, and rule of law are why our reserves will be the winner in world markets

I see “US oil profitable at $45/bbl” but to your point, still don’t know HOW MUCH is profitable at $45

Dunno if I’m missing data or it doesn’t exist

9524 2018-11-03 17:42:51 Damnnnn. Check the bus oil while you are down there
9525 2018-11-03 17:42:50 How can buses add congestion? When bus can carry 50 people but a private car taking roughly 1/3rd space of bus carries only 3-4? Also small cities like Durgapur, Bardhaman cant have metros. Of course people can buy, however increasing oil cost for private car will discourage.
9526 2018-11-03 17:42:47 The oil makes a difference. I find that cottonseed oil works well.

Yes love probably because you put too much oil on it....
9538 2018-11-03 17:41:36 Do one thing from now on you guys drink the used engine oil or the water from gutter to show solidarity with black people.
9539 2018-11-03 17:41:27 Told the girl that schedules my oil changes I love her bc she squeezed me in today and she said “prove it” 
9540 2018-11-03 17:41:26 What if Canada had spent $200bn on nuclear energy instead of oil?

Completely decarbonized electricity, transport, and heat, that’s what,
9541 2018-11-03 17:41:15 Exactly; they are 3-dimensional objects, often in sculptural frames, made out of wood, canvas, linen, silk, gesso, pigment, oil, resin, rabbits and sheep, gold and silver... they are not illustrations on flat white pages.
9542 2018-11-03 17:41:15 Hey mobil did not dril the exploration wel coz their tests showed more gas than oil, and here comes this invictus, with no money to even keep their head office clean, say they r goin to drill a well? With what funds???
9543 2018-11-03 17:41:15 Ive been using baking soda to cleanse my face, apple cider vinegar toner and coconut oil for moisture n protection and my skin have never been better , this is what we call being broke with benefits. Im so NATURAL HAHAHA
9544 2018-11-03 17:40:58 It aint that deep I mostly joking around about the oil change one my bad

9546 2018-11-03 17:40:54 I’ve pushed off this oil change for so long , let me get it over with 
9547 2018-11-03 17:40:53 More and more I'm thinking that I'm not really into sauces on things. They just seem to add uncertain weird tastes to things. I would rather just have the thing itself with just salt and pepper and maybe some oil.

9549 2018-11-03 17:40:44 Mr. Coren, I get what you're saying (and agree) but the viability of liberal democracy is separate from the imposition of LD by "the West" on other nations. GWB's Iraq War was also a complex mix of issues aside from "exporting" LD - oil, corruption, global power balance, etc...?
9550 2018-11-03 17:40:42 Two basic questions for Rafael: are you ever going to meet with REAL constituents?  What weight of oil do you use on your head and how often do you change it?
9551 2018-11-03 17:40:13 Thank you! Lots of work to keep eczema at bay (can also recommend The Inkey List's rosehip oil!)
9552 2018-11-03 17:40:13 #IfAtheistsRanTheWorld they would also remind you that they’re vegan and vape thc oil after they CrossFit.
9553 2018-11-03 17:40:10 yeah im gonna have to chop mine off soon bc ive bleached n dyed it so many times  but i recommend coconut oil hair masks n GOOD shampoo n conditioners & leave in conditioners after u get out the shower bc they will help reduce breakage. also a good trim to keep it growing often

9557 2018-11-03 17:39:39 Rosehip oil is being great for me.
9558 2018-11-03 17:39:35 what are your points BHAKT? Did they not lie about oil bonds?
9559 2018-11-03 17:39:25 I sure hope the oil isn’t ignited lol. The question was if the gas is ignited? Oil and gas are two different words . Now I am wondering what type of gas you’re talking about! Apparently this AH Horgan is subsidizing fracking in B.C. and Alberta buys a lot of the natural gas 
9560 2018-11-03 17:39:21 We need to spend billions on EVs to save trillions on WAR for OIL.

9563 2018-11-03 17:38:22 はじめまして、｢珍古台｣で検索して見つけました
たしか浜崎あゆみのは擬似４から小当たりかますんですよね...おそロシア
9564 2018-11-03 17:38:13 Damn near get a oil change every other month smh
9565 2018-11-03 17:38:11 The oil companies have put up almost $8 million so far to stop Measure G.
9566 2018-11-03 17:38:11 Yeah it's a nightmare finding a shade but it's worth it. They also do a micro eyebrow pencil for £2 & it's one of the best I've tried. Oil will transform your skin!
9567 2018-11-03 17:38:09 @NikkiaJoyy I just put on L’Oréal Infallible foundation and I can’t stop looking at my skin! Never would have thought! And oil at night has changed my life

9569 2018-11-03 17:38:06 They cooked the rice in peanut butter oil  I took a risk but damn you should check if they still have that meal comes with 6 king prawns and veggies on the side etc
9570 2018-11-03 17:38:05 my dog is on cbd oil for dogs right now please stand by while we wait for it to take effect
9571 2018-11-03 17:37:49 And the oil companies would leave here and with your 600 million people coming here with Open Borders California alone will explode..quit smoking the funny stuff maybe common sense will hit you in the face
9572 2018-11-03 17:37:30 << willing to kill for some argan oil rn
9573 2018-11-03 17:37:27 yeahhhh rosehip oil is THAT bitch!! acne scars who??? hyperpigmentation where????
9574 2018-11-03 17:37:25 Alberta is THRIVING ?This statement is incredible. How can any reasonable person think that Alberta is going in a positive direction?  Whether you like Oil & Gas or not is irrelevant. Fact is that this industry (+ Alberta) has never had less stability and arrows slung their way.
9575 2018-11-03 17:37:08 Noooo, kale's delicious! Sautee slowly with a drizzle of oil and a clove of garlic. It turns out like seaweed from a Chinese restaurant. If it compliments your main, add Chinese 5 spice and it really is seaweed! I love it on homemade pizza, it goes crispy and amazing in the oven!
9576 2018-11-03 17:36:44 อู้วหู้ว
9577 2018-11-03 17:36:38 I went into Primark to pick it up but they didn't have a suitable shade. Will keep trying though and will check out the oil tonight - winter is coming and all that 
9578 2018-11-03 17:36:35 Beds are Burning -Midnight Oil
9579 2018-11-03 17:36:20 Of course Government is not flawless. However adding more city buses will solve the problem. Just look at any traffic jam, maximum cars are used people and in most cars only 1-2 people are riding. Bikes also have better mileages so less oil consumption.
9580 2018-11-03 17:36:18 More specious conjecture from the PR man for big oil
9581 2018-11-03 17:36:15 Yo this is a vital piece of journalism as the nation heads into one of the most important elections of our lifetimes. Must have been up burning the midnight oil on this.
9582 2018-11-03 17:36:14 this excludes me , fresh oil change and everything bih
9583 2018-11-03 17:36:04 Got my oil changed, went to grab some stuff from Walmart for the week, and filled my tank up before noon 
9584 2018-11-03 17:36:03 Venezuela's oil isn't really economic. The big addition (I think 220bbl) is Orinoco tar sand. Oil has to be £100-150 for that to be produced and more importantly people need to want to invest.
9585 2018-11-03 17:36:02 I broke my sister's castor oil mascara 
9586 2018-11-03 17:35:59 Do you use a heating oil additive ? If so does it actually do anything for you? Reviews welcome :-) #oiladditive
9587 2018-11-03 17:35:47 I mean to review the book in light of elections in Maldives, S400 purchase, securing waivers for buying oil from Iran and getting recognition for building Chabbar. Looks too deliberate. Also funny how you disagree on his analysis not related to modi.

9589 2018-11-03 17:35:37 Does not the Alberta experience in the oil patch and with foreign workers not run counter to this.
9590 2018-11-03 17:35:34 He’s a snake oil salesman just like Trump. I refuse to buy one of his pillows.
9591 2018-11-03 17:35:30 Ps 133:2: It is like precious oil poured on the head, running down on the beard, running down on Aaron’s beard, down upon the collar of his robes.
9592 2018-11-03 17:35:29 And if America is foolish enough to vote Democrats into the Senate and House of Representatives and give them a majority those employment numbers will Plunge just like your energy sector will, that majority in the Senate and will shut down oil natuaral gas coal and #Manufacturing

9594 2018-11-03 17:35:22 You obviously aren't in tune with what the majority of Texans want. Beto wants to raise taxes take away oil jobs and take guns away what Texan wants that?
9595 2018-11-03 17:35:21 Oil and natural gas is bad and lithium is the only reasonable source of power
9596 2018-11-03 17:35:14 Lemme see ur oil change Receipt
9597 2018-11-03 17:35:04 Thanks! It is actually relatively easy to achieve (1/2):
1) black undercoat
2) "heavy" dry-brush with very dark silver color (to give some texture on the main part of the armor, and keep the lines/recess areas black)
3) apply nuln oil in recesses to further accentuate lines
9598 2018-11-03 17:35:00 Oh I've got quite a few! Primark longwear ultimate matte foundation is amazing. @NBHD_botanicals face oil is definitely up there too.

9601 2018-11-03 17:34:53 I'd say it's due mostly to uncertainty & angst in a fast changing world where previously acquired ways of being & rules of conduct need to be readjusted, all in the absence of any roadmap whatsoever. That's where the snake oil salesmen thrive. #cdnpoli
9602 2018-11-03 17:34:46 Burning the midnight oil.
9603 2018-11-03 17:34:45 Alaskans own 4,288,900 shares of STAR PETROLEUM REFINING PCL, worth $1,635,055. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in THAILAND.
9604 2018-11-03 17:34:42 If you plot the non oil trade balance against US GDP relative to rest of world--mostly explains it. The rest of the world is sucking.
9605 2018-11-03 17:34:36 It should not take 3 hours to “maybe” get my car in for an oil change when I called before I left my house and was told it would take 30 min to an hour 
9606 2018-11-03 17:34:22 I just put truffle oil on a chickfila sandwich. The future is now.

9608 2018-11-03 17:34:14 Exactly.
9609 2018-11-03 17:34:11 CNG and oil prices went alarmingly high causing price of every commodity and fares alarmingly high,yes this news went very much noticed,tax collection isn’t accounted for tax net’s widening but as a matter of bigger piece of soft cake e.g. bank tr tax .6% from .4%
9610 2018-11-03 17:34:02 So u having money in the bank, an AR-15 in your truck and no Mexicans on your block allows you ignore the obvious lack of truth from the POTUS?
Are u aware that, beyond his snake oil salesman rap, Trump is a lousy administrator? How many “best” people quit or are admitted felons?
9611 2018-11-03 17:34:01 1. Seriously? There are mountains of papers on this topic, dontbtrust science stop driving, using your phone or taking medicine. 
2. The crux here isn't that I find it weird, just how ludicrous your argument that There s more money being funneled into green energy than oil.
9612 2018-11-03 17:33:57 The pot is on the fire, the oil is frying. Ogbono over 3.5 loading... . If you like report to @jack
9613 2018-11-03 17:33:54 Oil cleansing ftw!
9614 2018-11-03 17:33:50 Silicon Valley's propaganda arm, its all about environmental but look its clear if you,mine lithium in open pits that you want to subdue dependence on oil
9615 2018-11-03 17:33:49 Again, how exactly does that work, especially on inflation?! Vzla just cleared a whole lot of PDVSA debt via Wall Street. There are no sanctions on oil, in part because of lobbying by US companies against that.
9616 2018-11-03 17:33:38 And then they gave it all away to the big oil companies for a pittance and the people got sod all.
9617 2018-11-03 17:33:28 Hahaha... Me too. Ni dr sorang founder yg promote Herv cleansing oil.

How many oil majors are leaving? 
None!
That's all that matters.

9628 2018-11-03 17:31:21 it depends on what kind of oil u take and how much oil u take lol but if you take it somewhere to get it done it be like 35-60. mfs will tax like 70-100 tho
9629 2018-11-03 17:31:14 .Maybe we should have noticed that the 9/11 terrorists were mostly from Saudi Arabia. But no, it was more convenient to go to war with a different country that was not supplying us with so much oil.

9633 2018-11-03 17:30:42 I do know that these oil/gas guys aren’t required to tag out and document abandoned gas lines and that was a cause of the Firestone house explosion a year or two ago. And that’s a safety regulation that can be introduced without 112.
9634 2018-11-03 17:30:30 If you don't have enough time for a full shower shaving session, just smooth baby oil onto your legs before you take the razor to them.
9635 2018-11-03 17:30:24 Just made winter warming home made cream of mushroom soup with warm rolls, garnish of truffle oil and chopped chives, for the soup I mean, woof woof! Send some to Roxy and his mama xxxxx
9636 2018-11-03 17:30:22 What's your plan for the hundreds of billions in oil field cleanup Alberta is on the hook for thanks to 40 years of conservative governments?
9637 2018-11-03 17:30:12 I’m going to attempt to change my own oil. Wish my luck  lol
9638 2018-11-03 17:30:09 I really hope Andrew Gillum wins Florida, but if I have to hear that story about blessed oil one more time.....
9639 2018-11-03 17:30:06 Tried CBD oil in my coffee & it was gr8
9640 2018-11-03 17:30:03 Use a bit of oil for mascara/eye/eyebrow makeup, use can use oil for lipstick too but just wash with water thoroughly and use a wipe or a cloth you don't mind getting dirty

9642 2018-11-03 17:29:55 Someone should come rescue me from Walmart while my oil gets changed. I have an 2 hour wait.
9643 2018-11-03 17:28:51 Where do you think all the office jobs that support that oil boom are? Houston, Dallas...
9644 2018-11-03 17:28:39 I like to brown it in a cast iron skillet using a duck fat/olive oil mix with a little salt and pepper, then pop it in the oven (I have to google time/temp). If you’re feeling ambitious you can put fresh rosemary, sage, garlic under the skin
9645 2018-11-03 17:28:22 Pple are vulnerable because of this economic crisis and these pastors are taking advantage of it. This time pple will wake up. How can a prophet wake up and say I now have muti ave n'anga over nyt. He should have been arrested long back for selling anointed oil
9646 2018-11-03 17:28:21 Clear soup
1)Wash,cut vegs, grate ginger, add salt to taste, green chillies chopped(add more if u like spicy)
2)Add 1cup water
3)Pressure cook with 1or 2 seeti
4)For tadka fry chopped garlic, onions, red dry chilli in 1 teaspoon oil. 
5)Add more water as desired n bring to a boil
9647 2018-11-03 17:28:17 And they wouldn’t at all pass on the added cost to the people purchasing the oil down the line, ultimately hitting consumers, would they?
9648 2018-11-03 17:28:01 @JacksonsArtTalk trying to order off your website and none of the oil colour charts are loading-might want to look into this.

9651 2018-11-03 17:27:44 Think about the logistics and the importance of oil in the process of making, delivering and powering a simple phone . Now replace oil with wind .
9652 2018-11-03 17:27:39 You are in the middle of a boom in West Texas. I cannot count the number of guys from here who have gone to the west Texas oil fields.

9672 2018-11-03 17:25:27 By raising sales taxes, state and federal tax, Obama & his politicans have cut funding to the middle class for basics such as health care, diapers, food, gas, heating oil etc. When progressives raise taxes, they are killing job benefits & cutting funding for elder and child care.
9673 2018-11-03 17:25:25 Depending on oil weight and how new the car is full synth is usually oem so it doesn’t cost too much more. All the luxury cars require full synth

9675 2018-11-03 17:25:05 California keeps fighting! I swear if Trump is not stopped every public land and parks will have oil rigs and the mountains will have giant mining holes in them. He plans to tear up everything good before he leaves office. Sicking

9684 2018-11-03 17:23:58 None of them, that’s the point. My friend Eduardo made $300,000 betting oil futures one summer and Eduardo won’t come close to getting in. The ability to make money doesn’t impress anybody around here.
9685 2018-11-03 17:23:56 Correct. Earlier that evening, Jackie Bird reported that the chancellor's windfall came "mainly from oil and gas revenues". Annoyingly iPlayer only keeps news programmes for 24 hours, so I can't post a clip for you, but I assure you it was said!

9688 2018-11-03 17:23:36 They need to go ahead and put that mess on Netflix if I don't see booty shaking and baby oil in the first 45sec.
Ain't nobody got time for all that dramatic buildup.

9689 2018-11-03 17:23:12 I think express oil change 
9690 2018-11-03 17:22:51 We are picking olive to make our tasty oil

Stiamo raccogliendo olive per fare il nostro gustoso olio  #food #olive #oil #bio #tuscany #agriturismo
9691 2018-11-03 17:22:35 I am so weird!!  I LOVE the smell of gun oil!!
9692 2018-11-03 17:22:23 history has shown that financially within a lie there is a bigger truth, the zimbo civiltry will bear the consequences of the bigger truth that there are large deposits of gas&oil; and they will b sold to the lowest bidder
9693 2018-11-03 17:22:22 He producing cooking oil for countries with favourable monitory policies, he can't make a loss in Zim with a delusional gedye gedye
9694 2018-11-03 17:22:19 people should stick with cannabis oil extracts from their locally grown pot shops. Especially "Charlotte's Web" strain, which was designed for children with seizures years ago in CO. 
This would be Patent Infringement, except the govt has had pot patent since 2003. 
9695 2018-11-03 17:22:14 Swearin' - Oil and Water - Grow Into A Ghost - Merge
9696 2018-11-03 17:22:07 I didn't even realize, the first thing I thought of was Genie from Aladdin
9697 2018-11-03 17:21:55 Then your Mumcee will deep you inside holy water/anointing oil
9698 2018-11-03 17:21:52 Oil me up

Cleanser low ph + oil based cleanser + toner + moisturizer = 109 lebih. 

Tu bru basic, blom masuk yg lain. 
Belom lagi cmpur skin supplement, mekap and yg lain . 

Jadi perempuan nk cntik kne kerja! Hahhahhahhhhahhahahaha
9700 2018-11-03 17:21:40 Sana oil
9701 2018-11-03 17:21:36 You need to teach me your ways because mine requires oil and even then it's messy 
9702 2018-11-03 17:21:36 Half of it is terrorism, half is them worrying about people unfurling a banner or pouring fake oil on the floor.
9703 2018-11-03 17:21:27 Lavender or tea tree oil and certain supplements such as Dong Quai and Tribulus terrestris have also been associated with #gynecomastia.
9704 2018-11-03 17:21:20 I find this thread really funny, when Tories express Outrage at a lack of Tax cuts for the wealthy.

Lacking any sense of Irony, it just leaves their Hypocrisy.

The Tories have looted 1 Trillion from oil revues 200,000 from each and every Scot.
9705 2018-11-03 17:21:08 Liberals would rather use dirty Saudis oil than our own high tech oil.
9706 2018-11-03 17:20:53 Liberals would rather use dirty Saudis oil than our own high tech oil.
9707 2018-11-03 17:20:52 My family has conversations like this: the chips are from Freeport, Illinois. These potato chips just aren’t the same as they used to be. Maybe they changed the oil. I think they changed they’re make up.
9708 2018-11-03 17:20:37 By raising sales taxes, state and federal tax, Obama & his politicans have cut funding to the middle class for basics such as health care, diapers, food, gas, heating oil etc. When progressives raise taxes, they are killing job benefits & cutting funding for elder and child care.
9709 2018-11-03 17:20:32 It's not about agreeing it's science. Lemon oil can peel paint and eat through plastic over time. That's PURE undiluted lemon EO, please don't spread misinformation and tell people to use them directly they can get hurt. If I did that, it could be a malpractice suit.
9710 2018-11-03 17:20:30 Put 4 tablespoons of baby oil in your bath water. Your skin will be silky smooth in no time.
9711 2018-11-03 17:20:30 Invictus was given the claims in Aug 2017. RGM was president. Walter Chidhakwa was mines minister. Undenge was Energy minister. Saka new dispensation yapinda papi?,If they forcibly terminate or take away claims. We will be hit with more sanctions n not be able to trade the oil
9712 2018-11-03 17:20:25 So you really have direct oil(10%), non oil dependent on oil(54%) and non oil not dependent on oil (36%). So you have an economy directly and indirectly dependent on oil for 64% of gdp. Should I go on?I don’t intend to waste my time So I need u to respond if I should or I won’t.
9713 2018-11-03 17:20:21 BG only had to divest UK oil assets, kept overseas oil assets, and all gas like Morecambe Bay.
Until privatisation they had 'statutory access'. Would have been useful for installing the oil pipeline across New Forest to Hamble like the gas pipelines, without planning permissions!
9714 2018-11-03 17:20:19 What governor I n s I e e.   is saying about inititive 1631 is pure bullshit. Don't be fooled people of washington. The tax us on the people not oil companies. Then give the state legislature billions of dollars to spend on anything. I n s I e e.  Is a liar....
9715 2018-11-03 17:20:09 My oil company apparently skipped my delivery even though I called yesterday to confirm. Not the 1st time. Going to be seething with rage all wknd. 
9716 2018-11-03 17:20:09 Canada has the third largest oil reserves of any country in the world after Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.
9717 2018-11-03 17:19:28 Jamaican Castor Oil >>> Vitamin E preferably.
9718 2018-11-03 17:19:23 Can't see Iran exports below 1m bpd without price collapse. Because China & India at least will lift Iran oil if price is right. In fact, I envisage cheap Iran oil supply to China ramping dramatically in 2019 & driving product exports at unbeatable prices. #OOTT
9719 2018-11-03 17:19:08 It's called 'free enterprise' because enterprises reap the benefits and society pays the costs. Big oil gets their water & land for free, eminent domain, and free dumping of waste into the air & water and onto the land. 1/2 #ableg
9720 2018-11-03 17:19:04 Thanks! I looked at it in ps—it’s called oil pastel large 2 but I know I modified it years ago. It’s one of the slanted rectangle ones that comes with ps
9721 2018-11-03 17:18:57 みんなで油祭りしようよ。英訳するとオイルフェスティバル。
9722 2018-11-03 17:18:43 Gov wanted to do oil backed crypto in Venezuela to circumvent sanctions. The people there do btc to circumvent the Venezuelan gov corruption and inflation of regular currency
9723 2018-11-03 17:18:37 Oil downturn is four years #OOTT I knew commodities cycles were long but this is too long

9726 2018-11-03 17:18:00 グリッドマン5.5話を聞いた
9727 2018-11-03 17:17:59 Baba Ncube did you also notice that ET fare went from $0.5 to $1, bread from $1 to $1.4, oats from $3 to $13, rice from $3 to $8, poor quality oil pint from $2 to $4 etc,. Our(civil servants) pay has remained the same. The shelves are stocked but we can't afford it.
9728 2018-11-03 17:17:57 I think they’ve discontinued the amazing £3 oil control moisturiser that I’ve been using for 10 years 
9729 2018-11-03 17:17:55 My mechanic be looking out. That price for my oil change & breaks wasn’t too much  it was the actual amount I wasn’t trying to go over lol
9730 2018-11-03 17:17:48 The way Bayern are going down enh they will soon discover oil.
9731 2018-11-03 17:17:41 Have a good weekend 

How are you today?
What will you do in weekend?
I did half time work in daytime are you having a good day? I feel good now I received products I ordered after 10days and I blended sweet almond oils with essential oils I like making my massage oil
9732 2018-11-03 17:17:40 There is an excellent argument for leaving oil in the ground. My opinion is having it as an asset to fall back on is good. I'd like to see the oil money fund a speedy transition to renewables - which we have HUGE potential in. I think we could be better off that way.
9733 2018-11-03 17:17:36 Bhosadi wale kisi ki bhakti nhi kar rahe hai.. Sachai bata rahe hai.. Ghar  m khane ke liye nhi hai aye bada twitter chalane..baniye ke dukaan pe jakar 100g mustard oil kharidta hai OR 2rs ki chhini..aye English sikhane. Ja tu halala karwa apni
9734 2018-11-03 17:17:35 So true.  The coup leaders actions during their breif 3 day tenure should tell you how extreme they were.  They canceled the constitution and they moved to privatize the oil industry on day 1.  That is very extreme.
9735 2018-11-03 17:17:26 They dismentled our police & military forces to invade us when they want. Militarised our oil fields to use money & buy warpons to kill us. Distroy our economy & industries to render us beggers.Arrogated to themselves power to control our lifes & destiny. BUT, OUR FREEDOM IS NOW.
9736 2018-11-03 17:17:08 Go to their office at Pelli phase 1 beside that fort oil fueling station. Go there and collect your money
9737 2018-11-03 17:17:06 This non oil sector that depends on oil using the input output tables is indirectly dependent o mojo for another 54% of gdp with the part not dependent on oil just about 36%.
9738 2018-11-03 17:17:02 signed to get an apartment this week and I’m on my lunch break getting an oil changed. adulting feels so good :)
9739 2018-11-03 17:16:51 That's not snow. It's called chimvuramabwe in shona. Chances of snow in Murehwa in November are as high as chances of extracting oil from Muzarabani

9742 2018-11-03 17:15:55 Availability of forex depends on CBN foreign reserves which depends on our major forex earner which is oil. This non oil sector which depends on oil cuts across many of the 46 economic activities such as trade, real estate, construction, finance etc
9743 2018-11-03 17:15:54 First, thank you for sharing the article.
No doubt that increased U.S. production has changed oil market. It does NOT free U.S. or world from dependence on middle east. 

How can authors ignore huge increase in world oil price b/c of pending IR sanctions? Pure bias!
9744 2018-11-03 17:15:44 Iran is the biggest threat to the World 

because of all that flammable oil underneath their land.

Only the US can reduce that potential fire risk!!

9746 2018-11-03 17:15:30 Iran as well. It’s not good when big oil pdoducing countries jump to China for trade and banking.
9747 2018-11-03 17:15:25 Build refineries for canadians so that we have 0 dependency on foreign oil.
9748 2018-11-03 17:15:24 Today is going great. I got a haircut and an oil change by 9 AM and I'm blessed that my two favorite places (Wegmans and Nordstrom Rack) are right next to each other.
9749 2018-11-03 17:15:15 One cannot do without tea and cookies! Like the sun and the moon! Water and oil!
9750 2018-11-03 17:15:13 Why this dude I was sitting by while I was getting my oil changed said “you got some nice feet, you don’t see that often” 
9751 2018-11-03 17:14:53 I originally planned to go to the mall and hit the gym while the truck was getting an oil change. While I did get to the mall I definitely just got Chinese food and avoided the part of the mall where the gym is.
9752 2018-11-03 17:14:51 Damn this girl asked for my number to send me a castor oil tutorial  I honestly don’t know why ..... but she actually kinda cute

9758 2018-11-03 17:14:22 Vanakkam Sister, excellent question! Thank you for asking these valid question, during oil bath water pollution may happen, during making murukku environment can get spoiled while heating oil. Supporting your efforts!

9763 2018-11-03 17:14:08 Report it to your councillor and @311Toronto 

One of the problems with #visionzero and lack of data.

When you find a Traffic situation that  is obviously a continuous danger - report it. Often.

#topoli 

Squeaky wheel gets the oil.
9764 2018-11-03 17:14:00 The #US has reimposed additional #sanctions on #Iran. Eight countries — including #India, #SouthKorea, #Japan and #China, among the world’s largest importers of Iranian #oil — were granted six-month waivers. The #EU did not receive an exemption.
9765 2018-11-03 17:13:56 Sana oil may kasama. Sana oil may kakwentuhan.
9766 2018-11-03 17:13:51 somebody help me, why is my car squeaking when i turn it on?! i just got a oil change not too long ago
9767 2018-11-03 17:13:46 Gas 
Oil change  
Car wash 
9768 2018-11-03 17:13:44 Second you have a non oil sector dependent on the oil sector through its ability to provide foreign exchange. Let me take manufacturing to explain. It’s not an oil activity but depends heavily on oil since rheybrely on imported inputs which require forex
9769 2018-11-03 17:13:44 Let me tell you - crude oil price, US-NZ exchange rate, profit margins.
9770 2018-11-03 17:13:38 They can say whatever they want. I’m only getting that oil change, PERIOD! 
9771 2018-11-03 17:13:36 I think the Portland was 4 days to Dry oil but this is deeper. So more brine to remove.
9772 2018-11-03 17:13:30 É que na minha idade você já não olha pra qualquer psiu.
9773 2018-11-03 17:13:21 Vote no on #I-1631, I support big oil
9774 2018-11-03 17:13:08 caveat, my skin LOVES straight oil. other caveat, i live in the desert
9775 2018-11-03 17:12:58 YA AND WE COULDN'T BE MAD CAUSE WE WERE BOTH DOING IT 
9776 2018-11-03 17:12:56 bread n cooking oil
9777 2018-11-03 17:12:43 Then they would not be leaders. Think you want policy representatives, lobbyists.
9778 2018-11-03 17:12:37 I can’t believe my bf got all his weed & wax oil taken away as soon as we got into Utah  just because I got pulled over for making a wide left turn....
9779 2018-11-03 17:12:34 Yeah sure not been doing much here tbh. I had to scale back because it started to affect my health. Palm oil is another thing I avoid unless if it's sustainably sourced I buy sometimes but I've cut down on it too lately. I have an eating disorder so food for me is a big issue

9781 2018-11-03 17:12:22 Ro said I might need a new clutch .
That mean Ima have to drain the oil and all today!
9782 2018-11-03 17:12:12 While non oil is the remaining 90%. However the non oil sector in Nigeria can really be further broken down into two segments. First you have a non oil economy not really dependent on the oil sector eg agriculture to an extent
9783 2018-11-03 17:12:09 I recommend baby shea moisture for the shampoo and conditioner, and second the idea of coconut oil as a styler
9784 2018-11-03 17:12:04 I support the US President but sometimes presidency can be a mistake... like 2008 - 2016. Rekindled the racial divide while MSM kept pouring more oil.
9785 2018-11-03 17:11:57 Voting #9? Are u kidding me? Oil/gas and vaping all lumped together? Ridiculous. NO again
9786 2018-11-03 17:11:56 Erdogan is the international oil thief
9787 2018-11-03 17:11:55 Coconut oil is the best makeup remover!!!!!
9788 2018-11-03 17:11:54 Something something Qatar and oil money ruining football. From the slaves that are dying building the 2022 Qatar WC site to them inflating the transfer market. Go build your own league and start there like China did instead of ruining a Paris based team.
9789 2018-11-03 17:11:51 Just change my oil and send me on my way!!
9790 2018-11-03 17:11:48 I vividly remember getting a word wrong on a spelling test in 1st grade (I was a good speller and later in a spelling bee), because the teacher pronounced "oil" as "'ol" and I didn't know what she was saying 

I'm from VA, too, but pretty sure she was from further south!
9791 2018-11-03 17:11:48 Already just remember back wit  shit don’t come wit oil

9793 2018-11-03 17:11:46 twitter, what should I put in my hair if I want it to look gross and stringy like Gerard Way's for the whole evening? I have coconut oil, would that work or would it soak in and make me look good by accident?
9794 2018-11-03 17:11:42 When I lived in Spain for 6 years I used to eat a slice of bread with Marmite/vegimite on each day and Mosquito's never cane near. I've also heard if you eat plenty of garlic you won't get bitten. In England we have Avon Dry Oil spray that works great to keep bugs away
9795 2018-11-03 17:11:42 Makeup remover tak boleh dijadikan OIL CLEANSER tapi oil cleanser boleh dijadikan MAKEUP REMOVER!

Acaner tu???
9796 2018-11-03 17:11:34 I hate when i get a oil change they always telling me about all this other stuff i should do

9798 2018-11-03 17:11:28 If you frustrate one foreign business, you have killed 100s. UBS left as a result of poor economic policies. They don't understand where we are headed as a nation. We are spending our oil money like the way yahoo boys spend money in night clubs instead of investing them.
9799 2018-11-03 17:11:25 Oil and weapons manufacturers or banks donating to campaigns, lobbying to shape our politics - no problemo. Free speech, even.

Soros donates to influence politics - endless stream of anti-Semitic slurs and conspiracy theories
9800 2018-11-03 17:11:19 My mom said you can put castor oil in your ear with warm water is one of those snot suckers to suck up the nasty stuff. Or she said peroxide warm water helps but someone gotta be there to help.
9801 2018-11-03 17:11:13 How beautiful is our fall weather, Oregon? It does not get much finer than this! Get on out to play, and come visit us to try our new organic essential oil line at the Portland Saturday Market. We're in booth 709 in Ankeny Park until 5pm! 
9802 2018-11-03 17:11:11 >wakes up at 12:58

9804 2018-11-03 17:10:48 Bio oil is my saving grace
9805 2018-11-03 17:10:36 There are also indirect impacts of one sector on the other. This is where you get your input/output and supply/use tables which show dependency of one sector on all others. U need to read up on this as well later. Now based on UN SNA amd ISIC mentioned before oil contributes 10%
9806 2018-11-03 17:10:35 to be taxed 2%/$,told there are oil deposits in Muzarabani, to betray Chiwenga, hire Acie & fire him, loot

9810 2018-11-03 17:10:19 i wasnt intending to be unpleasant. Inwas making aserious point about oil money and consumer demand. You guys are the ones bringing in hypocrisy. As I have explained that was not the case, so drop it. how much cash have you given to big oil as a consumer Gavin?

9816 2018-11-03 17:09:15  I’ll have to look up RT abit more.

I too think China will be the powerhouse. China is very smart in creating ties with so many countries that despise the US! 

Venezuela is accepting yuan for oil now. Russia would be on board and I think Japan is heading that way.
9817 2018-11-03 17:09:03 Is indeed very painful  but let’s wait and see if the oil and discovery will beef up the Zimbabwean economy and utterly change the lives of Zimbabweans for better
9818 2018-11-03 17:09:00 The oil market had developed a completely different market supply dynamics with the U.S. production.  Though I dont agree with much of the perspective of the author, I tend to agree that the U.S. production is of influence.
9819 2018-11-03 17:08:56 Oh hai, local lizard person here: I'm using the Peach & Lily oil blend that's a hefty part squalene and really enjoying it, both by itself and mixed into moisturizer.
9820 2018-11-03 17:08:47 Free college is paid for with a 2% tax on wallstreet speculation. Public housing for every homeless person could be paid for by ending the 88 billion dollars in subsidies for oil companies. And if we ended the Bush and trump tax cuts we would balance the budget.
9821 2018-11-03 17:08:46 you can economy that is import dependent lack of power supply ridden with boko haram insurgent  oil theft by govt official and militant low capital investment will be growing at that rate
9822 2018-11-03 17:08:42 Texas Republicans convinced me to vote straight Democratic forever when Wm. B. Clements said that all that was needed to clean up his Campeche Bay oil spill was a hurricane. When coastal residents (& others) screamed, he said. "I meant an *offshore* hurricane." #Dem4ever

9826 2018-11-03 17:08:13 Dems ask the wrong questions: Pres. Trump dismantled Obama's policies, implemented deregulation, tax cuts, oil independence, new trade deals, business friendly environ, instilled consumer confidence, created jobs/business Obama said never coming back, How is it Obama's economy?
9827 2018-11-03 17:08:13 Good example is when coastal progressives hit oil & gas and many TX Dems are like  these are TX jobs

9835 2018-11-03 17:07:52 @IGTonColors You should find the real and ordinary people who are coming at your stage to perform. Do not choose only singers & dancers bcz there are other shows for them.

9837 2018-11-03 17:07:47 Agree magic estimates are awful. A bit like making a statement on big oil and then using a graph of European majors. Funny given Chevron and ExxonMobil are US companies, and BP will lose European status with Brexit. So that graph is irrelevant to 50%+ of big oil

The edible will be 100 times bigger market than the oil or leaves one mainly because of teens ranging from 13 to 30 years old.
9851 2018-11-03 17:05:21 Who is supporting Iran? CCP! ZTE is one of the CCPs in spite of UN sanctions, buying Iranian oil and providing stolen technology to Iran. If Israel sells high technology to the CCP, then he is likely to provide technology to Iran.

9866 2018-11-03 17:04:18 @NationalreviewG 
Really? The author's (one of whom is Harold Hamm!) are unaware of the oil market's reaction to the IR sanctions?

"The Trump administration’s looming imposition of sanctions against Iran has hardly caused a financial ripple in the oil market."
9867 2018-11-03 17:04:01 Do you really need to buy cooking oil every time you get into a shop?

9869 2018-11-03 17:03:49 Isn't the south china sea the new priority for the US? US has enough oil and they don't whant to lose their hegemony to growing power of PRC.
9870 2018-11-03 17:03:23 If you know that short oil futures and then fund republican causes like Soros, etc..

Iran's sanctions remove 3M barrels per day. It's a complicated formula.

9881 2018-11-03 17:02:07 pooling and sharing - don’t forget we shared our oil wealth (swings and roundabouts)

but fine, we can decide not to pool and share and accept that would means we could spend less on public services: all I’m asking for is for that to be honestly presented

9887 2018-11-03 17:01:35 There was a plan for riots throughout the country, and the media and some political parties had to work quickly on oil.
That's why some of the media in the world were very troubled when the agreement was fixed and it also expressed his expression that why the operation was not .

9898 2018-11-03 16:59:56 He brought up big oil. Once again, as soon as it get too close to home ie taking personal responsibility tonrwduce your own C02 emissions /quality of life, the nasty names come out, the evasion tactics come along
9899 2018-11-03 16:59:50 Hmm.. and how did the epa cause a mining spill and an oil spill exactly?

Oh, but let’s open up more areas for oil drilling, via Trump.  That won’t pollute the planet more or increase the risk of more spills, will it? 
9900 2018-11-03 16:59:45 It’s good because it doesn’t take much seasoning..season salt, garlic, cayenne if you want spicy, and a tablespoon of either olive or avocado oil.  Exorcist isn’t my thing so I’ll keep on eating it.  Husband loves it, and it makes several meals for less than $2.
9901 2018-11-03 16:59:24 Eff you in a big tub of oil Cam
9902 2018-11-03 16:59:09 I don’t work in oil or anywhere near it. But I fully understand we need it in our country to sustain any kind of life for our families. I agree fully, we can move into electric cars, and reduce unneeded pollution. But oil is used for far more then just that. Everyday products.
9903 2018-11-03 16:59:04 Chilly pork from a Tibetan Restaurant in Kolkata. Oil might have been the reason too. The problem is that feel is not going away whenever I think of pork.
9904 2018-11-03 16:58:57 Glad you feel that way, reporting on oil pipeline failure, marijuana screw up, and tags on carbon oh price on pollution.
9905 2018-11-03 16:58:56 When asphalt prices raise so will the amount of your tax dollars to fund roads. Gas will increase and flights will be more expensive. There needs to be some modifications to safety and oil fracking but 112 isn’t that. I’m not a rich dude but I work in the asphalt industry, 3/4
9906 2018-11-03 16:58:45 98% of article is right on.  It says dont drink sodas, water is best which is accurate.  Coconut oil is one of those fad things.  I will use on my skin and to season my pan but not going to eat spoonfuls of it

9937 2018-11-03 16:55:48 Caro Bruno Mars, why stove and salami sandwich? Mamma Mia!!! If it's real salami, you only put on white bread like ciabatta (maybe toasted and garlic rubbed on crunchy crust) sprinkle olive oil, maybe add tomato slices or arugula and then lay salami slices on top. OK to layer.
9938 2018-11-03 16:55:46 Look! Polls is snake oil! Since the beginning, pollsters were nothing more than witchcraft! It still is! Crystal balls are more successful than the mathematical models using in polling. Remember the @HillaryClinton landslide of 2016? Right, #MeToo!

9940 2018-11-03 16:55:34 It changes drilling next to schools or subdivisions from 500’ away to 2500’ away. They will still get the same oil they even if it’s 500’ from a school. Will just directionally bore to get it. With directional boring comes added cost. 1/2
9941 2018-11-03 16:55:30 I also wonder what all those environmental specialists employed by oil company’s in charge or the cleannup and remediation would think of your “ruined land” line. What’s green peace or Green Party doing to physically repair land?
9942 2018-11-03 16:55:04 Beto is a Socialist who would turn Texas into California. He believes in open borders. High taxes, $10 tax on a barrel of oil, funds the illegal alien caravan etc...He is wrong for Texas!!!

9949 2018-11-03 16:54:29 하루가ㅠㅠ앗쨩ㅇ을ㅜㅠㅜㅜ기다려요ㅠㅜ
9950 2018-11-03 16:54:21 One disagreement from your piece @_YogendraYadav - even with low crude oil prices in 2014 govt repaid only 1500cr out of 1.5 lakh cr worth of oil bonds taken by UPA 2. Pl recheck this and correct your piece.
9951 2018-11-03 16:54:21 I’d guess so for EU, more banking ties. Asia needs that oil more and has fewer banking ties.
9952 2018-11-03 16:54:17 One of our teacher has told us about using Sesame oil for Deepas. Since this happens at the beginning of winter such Deepas act as a good protection against cold and also against flies, insects because it's also a harvest festival.

9955 2018-11-03 16:53:58 — thoroughly before anything else. “There,” he said and wiped his hands off on his own towel. He put the oil up, the kissed right between Bucky's shoulder blades before he exited the bathroom. “What clothes did you bring? I wanna put some —
9956 2018-11-03 16:53:56 — “It’s okay, handsome. Turn around for me,” he said as he poured some of the oil onto his hand. As Bucky turned, Steve started to massage it into his lover’s back. He made sure to be gentle and make sure all of it was rubbed in nice and —

9959 2018-11-03 16:53:43 @Wawa I have loved you for so long. Why on earth would you donate to Republican Scott Wagner for PA Governor? He threatened @GovernorTomWolf and journalists with violence, and is 100% owned by the oil and gas industry. This is so disappointing to find out.
9960 2018-11-03 16:53:42 Is Vancouver polluting water by dumping raw sewage in the ocean? Montreal into st Lawrence? Halifax did for years, had to spend millions to clean it up, so I think the water polluting is more then just oil industry’s. Your simply attacking the industry that finically benefits you
9961 2018-11-03 16:53:36 bought a fragrance oil lamp, candles and a lighter but couldnt find fragrance oil rip rip rip i just want to calm my anxiety let me live ;-;
9962 2018-11-03 16:53:34 I mean, seriously...prissy lindsey looks like he showers in Wesson oil before photo ops.  It sure as shit ain't stud sweat.
9963 2018-11-03 16:53:26 앗쨩보고싶다젠장할
9964 2018-11-03 16:53:25 Additionally, when the next line of leadership appears to be Champikas and Sajiths, we tend to think that 'the hearts are soaked in poisonous and inflammable oil and ready to be ignited by communal fire' in the future as well. There is no 'lesser evil'. @akeenan23
9965 2018-11-03 16:53:22 From the discovery to production this is not oil where you just dig a hole ...
9966 2018-11-03 16:53:19 Ladies what’s a good full coverage, oil free foundation?? I need to try something new 
9967 2018-11-03 16:53:06 Are bull horns allowed in Lucas oil?
9968 2018-11-03 16:52:58 Offshore platform = $ 30 per barrel (maybe it links to the Heavens).

Onshore platform = $ 15 to $ 22 per barrel.

Very crazy prices. U know what would be happening behind closed doors, don't U - a-la- Gandollar style.

Oil production in Saudi (in fact middle east) = $ 8 - 15
9969 2018-11-03 16:52:45 makasihh coba aja pake minayk2 gituu kaya olive oil atau castor oil!
9970 2018-11-03 16:52:26 Nope. Hydraulic fluids, kinetic and static, compressor oils, cutting fluids.
Bit of 4 ball testing? clamp 3 0.5" ballbearings in oil reservoir, rotate loaded 4th ball on top. Measure scar size. Poor oil would weld up - instant test fail!
9971 2018-11-03 16:52:26 I won't be buying the peanut butter again as it swims in oil and is gross. It didn't need palm oil 15 years ago so why does it need it now? Same for lemon curd.
9972 2018-11-03 16:52:08 Perhaps the financial sanctions that you support have something to do with this.  The oil sector is prevented from importing any parts or equimpement.  It has nothing to do with socialism if oil wells get shut down because the sanctions prevent them from buying replcament parts.
9973 2018-11-03 16:52:06 gambar last tu baru je. lepastu naik jerawat balik sbb pakai compact powder pixy. tngk tngk ada mineral oil! haih sabar je la. baru je rasa dahi licin kejap dh naik jerawat

9975 2018-11-03 16:51:57 I am still trying to figure out why we so in love with the Saudis? They financed and sent us he 911 hijackers. We don't need their oil and they and their religious leaders have supported terrorists. Allies? BS!
9976 2018-11-03 16:51:46 Over 5-6 years, the control group pumped ~8500 mL of mineral oil in their body!!!
9977 2018-11-03 16:51:24 She is not aware with international prices for crude oil, crude oil prices experiencing in increasing trend since February 2018   She must learn and be awarded before tweeting.

Beer/Porter
9980 2018-11-03 16:51:16 First of all I didn't make any personal attack, I asked him a simple question. Point out where I have made any personal attack, conspiracy teoeies really? Prove my analysis wrong. Also go through current global scenario's on how oil prices crashed. Fluke prediction really?+
9981 2018-11-03 16:51:15 Massage a few drops of coconut oil around the eyes to get rid off dark circles.
9982 2018-11-03 16:51:12 How much was oil price per barrel as at then and how much was it in Gej time? Talking about recession
9983 2018-11-03 16:51:10 Well yes but I liked the previous deal, oil price go up again with sanctions.
9984 2018-11-03 16:51:06 As terrible as the deaths are (Lazarus Drug on Hidden Brain), you are taking away altogether the agency of the addicted consumers 

Same logic as blaming tobacco, oil, and gun mfr companies

A principled stand on all issues or triggerer by the “Chinese” role?
9985 2018-11-03 16:50:52 There just a typical elite mate the only way to stop them is for the world to move away from fossil fuels and mankind to use the technology that has been withheld from us all one day the oil monopolies will end
9986 2018-11-03 16:50:44 first of four days off  watching the haunting of hill house, with goulash and pasta and rhubarb tart and custard and going to have a long soak in the bath later with lush hair oil 
9987 2018-11-03 16:50:36 Solar oil a fait rentré Vinicius Nyaaa
9988 2018-11-03 16:50:29 He is trying 
to milk Saudies 
to the last drop of 
their oil money..

Another classic bigotry case..
9989 2018-11-03 16:50:22 I cant go anywhere without finding someone I know from school or if I met in doing something in the past lol.... just today I ran into an old friend from high school getting my oil changed lol
9990 2018-11-03 16:50:20 Analysis of the week. Job numbers too high? Big business banding together to inflate numbers B4 election. Trump allows oil sales from Iran to flood Global pipelines. Gas drops down fast! Trump covers the dump with BS all sanctions enforced to cover manipulation.
9991 2018-11-03 16:50:19 Try a product called wonderside its a cedar oil spray it's safe around pets.

9993 2018-11-03 16:49:48 Resisting oil state and fascism is my motivation for walking more.
9994 2018-11-03 16:49:32 I am just making a simple observation that these results are too good and may be confounded by mineral oil preventing the absorption of lipid soluble statins, thus lowering the dose in control group. Instead of TG reduction and CVOT, is this a high vs low dose statin study?
9995 2018-11-03 16:49:26 Bursting Mala pataki early in the morning after a oil bath. This is followed till now. Next set of Mala pataki is on Tulsi Pooje which happens after 13 days.
9996 2018-11-03 16:49:23 Sesame oil in brownies is actually great

9998 2018-11-03 16:49:16 I’m good when it comes to oil changes o learned my lesson with my first car.
9999 2018-11-03 16:49:07 But we could be 100% renewable in CO but they will still drill in residential areas and ship overseas. We export 88% of our gas and use our oil for plastics. They could use all their millions instead of fighting for relevancy, but rather invest in a clean future for Americans+.
10000 2018-11-03 16:49:05 Mvdeo no puede ser pionera cuando el transporte público colectivo se basa UNICAMENTE en ómnibus a gas oil, con carroceria de los 80 y sin accesibilidad. Es de las pocas capitales de AL donde no hay ni tranvias, ni trolebuses, ni metro. Y solo hay un ómnibus eléctrico “a prueba”
10001 2018-11-03 16:49:04 石油だってオリーブオイルだって変わらぬオイルだ。だからみんな、資源は大切に使おう。
10002 2018-11-03 16:49:03 i love when students just drop by my office to smell my oil diffuser & chat during their free period.  1 comes in every time before tests & puts some on his temples bc it relaxes him & says he concentrates more

10010 2018-11-03 16:47:45 Sears has always been our go to for oil changes. My son is there now and just called to tell me that oil change price now higher than 2 months ago. What's up with this?
10011 2018-11-03 16:47:41 Exactly! The homeopathic folks need to stop being called doctors and prevented from peddling their snake oil.
10012 2018-11-03 16:47:39 Dolapo (like his minister crush - Kachikwu) R happy wt signing crude lifting/fuel import contracts, so they keep D refineries in a state of disrepair.He enjoys how D oil minister/ministry lies to Nigerians about regulation/liberalization & yet continue 2 pay subsidy 2 demselves
