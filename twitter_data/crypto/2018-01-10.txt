53 2018-01-10 23:57:46 I’ve read through some of your tweets. I see now that you’re more of a traditional investor (stocks, etc). Maybe you’ve seen trading volume disappear as some investors have gone to crypto. Is this the main reason for your comments?

66 2018-01-10 23:56:22 Hey crypto love great insight into crypto on your YouTube channel. New to all this but learning so fast . Can u still watch webinar? New to Twitter too! Lol thanks for all your hard hard and dedication to making crypto world a revolution! 
67 2018-01-10 23:56:15 I appreciate when someone questions crypto currency. You should find some smarter techie friends.

The Bitcoin he bought is a cryptographic series of numbers and letters. It can be accessed at anytime through a key. In the same way that your credit card stores data, so does BTC.
68 2018-01-10 23:56:10 How do you think they engineer this? Is it whales pumping cash which generates demand then generating excitement then selling all at once?
69 2018-01-10 23:56:05 Im thinking the same lol #nopumpmaybedump #hold
70 2018-01-10 23:56:03 Maybe $BTC is ready to spring from its coil after plenty has been made in alts lately and general public acceptance of #crypto keeps growing.
71 2018-01-10 23:56:02  thank you! Great project, happy to invest :)

76 2018-01-10 23:55:48 $appc is still a steal at its current price. 86m coins (after confirmed burn from official twitter) meaning the marketcap is sub 500m. It just got to Binance and the coin is worth checking out. Just my opinion (I do have an investment in this coin) #crypto

83 2018-01-10 23:55:32 That's how we got burned over that be Coinbase fiasco. Always told people stop hyping up that XRP will be on Coinbase. We had zero proof, yet everyone jumped on it like it was 100% true. When it didn't happen, that started the spiral downwards to where we are now.

89 2018-01-10 23:55:17 @TeamJRBusiness I appreciate your team's dedication and insight in the crypto space. I believe Xtrabytes (XBY) is really developing something that will bring as much benefit to the crypto space as XRB has brought. This project is on the ground floor and super undervalued.

96 2018-01-10 23:54:43 To our teams knowledge, they have not. The general trend for crypto exchanges is to play quiet and coy with any internal workings. It's unfortunately the way they've (until recently) been able to operate due to previously small blockchain community.

The value of being able to independently store your money virtually, where it’s safe and you have full control over it, while noone else has, is simply invaluable! Plus you can send it anywhere within a few minutes or seconds.

130 2018-01-10 23:52:07 There is way too much rhetoric and schadenfreude in crypto. Too much divisiveness. There is enough profit for everyone. No reason to take things personally if someone has an opposing view.
131 2018-01-10 23:52:06 Interesting. Most people ask me if I'm rich yet. I still have a similar reaction to them though.
132 2018-01-10 23:51:57 Yeah, the thing about crypto is decentralization. Can you prove I hold thousands of $ARK, for example? You can't. And the private key I already committed to memory.
133 2018-01-10 23:51:56 Haha, jesus bitcoin legacy users are really as dumb as they say huh.

162 2018-01-10 23:49:19 Earn?? Free crypto is always good when I hardly have any lmao. I'm ready to get some skin in the game
163 2018-01-10 23:49:17 Just staked my $BCO's for 3 months. DEX, the future and safe future of crypto exchanges.  Decentralize the world!  AND my coins are up 4x already! Thanks Dan 
164 2018-01-10 23:49:16 Can't wait to wake up tomorrow to find out what the fuck is in store for us. Bloody love $crypto, it's so damn entertaining. Cheers guys 
165 2018-01-10 23:49:14 Lol wow you really caught offence to that LOL
166 2018-01-10 23:49:12 I'm sitting here watching as well.  Not sure when I want to go in.
167 2018-01-10 23:49:09 Bonjour @AlainSoralOffic je vous conseille de commencer à chercher du côté des réseaux sociaux par la technologie blockchain, décentralisés; deux exemples, @steemit (de la crypto remplace les "j'aime" :) ) et @AkashaProject . Autant prendre les devants.
168 2018-01-10 23:49:03 Good job the twat didn't dive into a project.
169 2018-01-10 23:49:01 Very interesting, with impatience I will wait for new news from you! #ICO #P2PSF #Crypto #Altcoin #Blockchain
170 2018-01-10 23:48:55 Holy shit can we just appreciate VeChain's fucking rally today. 

This is what making life-changing money looks like. 

Blessed to be part of $crypto, it's gains & the awesome community it holds.
171 2018-01-10 23:48:55 What is your favorite method for seeking out and purchasing ICO's? 

Curious the diff. ways the community goes about it.
172 2018-01-10 23:48:53 The key
173 2018-01-10 23:48:48 Start using #Discord #Telegram it will change the way you look at crypto
174 2018-01-10 23:48:48 I discovered that he was the good guy.
175 2018-01-10 23:48:44 Thats a fair point and a point that anyone who invest in Crypto takes.  However for the common person who has no ability to invest in an ICO not along a Pre-ICO...........well this is all we have.  If you look at Crypto currencies as a group they have outperformed any other asset
176 2018-01-10 23:48:43 Only 1 of 2 things can happen in $Crypto if you just HODL!..... ? $BTC $ETH $LTC $XRP $ADA $NEO
177 2018-01-10 23:48:40 This is not just a cryptocurrency or digital asset, and network and Protocol. In comparison of speed and efficiency, crypto allows you to conduct transactions much faster and with less cost
#ICO #P2PSF #Crypto #Altcoin #Blockchain
178 2018-01-10 23:48:32 This is basically the legal equivalent of cash or bearer bonds. The problem is that all these types of instruments have been marginalized or made illegal in last decades. They are open to abuse and provide little use for everyday ppl. Similarly I struggle with benefits of crypto.
179 2018-01-10 23:48:29 A great project which requires a field of blockchain technology! The innovative project begins its participation in ICO!

180 2018-01-10 23:48:29 Hey brotha how high do you think ZCL will go before the fork ?
181 2018-01-10 23:48:26 Yeah, its pretty close though... I know he said he was holding ADA and updating it every couple days.
182 2018-01-10 23:48:23 If you were in crypto when I took over Viacoin & you didn't buy and hodl

You have 0 reason to broke atm.

If you bought with a bit more than $600 at the time and still bought a bit late. Like days after.

you should have like $180k now
183 2018-01-10 23:48:23 BTC Maybe but not the Crypto Currency, unfortunately for me investors starting to perfect this technology around November and I'm trying to get in since New Year's Eve but it's definitely here for the Long Haul
184 2018-01-10 23:48:17 Great news ! soon the company came into the ICO! Looking forward to the news! I'm sure it will be a big success!

197 2018-01-10 23:46:49 If you can’t make your mind up where to invest... seriously stay away from crypto.. you’re not for investing money. Sorry. 
198 2018-01-10 23:46:45 Sure,  understandable. Near term it may pull back a little tbh. 
If I may give you a bit if info. 
$ven coins grant you ownership of the blockchain. As a result $vet holders are rewarded with THOR which is used by users of BChain to do TXNs. Like NEO/GAS. Good Luck in crypto. 
199 2018-01-10 23:46:44 Make sure y’all getting that crypto money.   Easy buckets for the shrewd

203 2018-01-10 23:46:22 Many currency speculators are investing in crypto this year, spurred by bitcoin’s big gains recently. Do you think crypto prices are reflective of their true value or are we seeing rising prices due to FOMO?
204 2018-01-10 23:46:20 Crypto is going to redistribute wealth all over the globe, people will make money and people will lose it, same as things have always been... When you generate income from your decentralised coin, what are you going to do with it?
205 2018-01-10 23:46:05 I’m so pissed. An crypto currency I heard underground about was worth 25 cents a few weeks ago. Today that same crypto is worth $4 wtf
206 2018-01-10 23:46:03 Coins to watch: $IOTA $LTC $VTC all have similar patterns--dynamite.  #crypto #bitcoin #cryptocurrencies
207 2018-01-10 23:45:45 You know how the phrase "crypto-fascist" is a joke about left-wing excess? How did it feel working for The Mail circa 1933 @toadmeister? Recant
208 2018-01-10 23:45:42 For those of you that are taking this wayyy too seriously, you really need to relax a bit. Charlie is just messing around. A major issue with the #tron #trx community is this tribe-like persona that escalates even the most minute things. #ltc #litcoin #cryptocurrency #Crypto
209 2018-01-10 23:45:36 They need their Crypto Kitty money back Suppo.
210 2018-01-10 23:45:33 Already have my dream truck. I would get a new corvette tho if the crypto Gods would have it. Till then it’s #FordFiesta life 
211 2018-01-10 23:45:32 Yes, I noticed some of the penny stocks are already way past your predictions, it would be much better to be able to keep up weekly
212 2018-01-10 23:45:25 the market makers take too much profit off the table. we dont need them. bitcoin doesnt have one. crypto is a decentralised phenomenon so we dont need mm controling the market movements. seriously. them taking huge profit is what s hurting the ordinary ppl who support tron.
213 2018-01-10 23:45:25 Are there any other coins that offer programs like this ??
214 2018-01-10 23:45:18 Crypto!

218 2018-01-10 23:44:57 Hey your pal Joe here I updated my header and profile pic   Soon I will be doing videos, be launching my Facebook, and shortly after a website with links, pointers, and trends in the crypto currency market
219 2018-01-10 23:44:52 Of course, Crypto will make many more millionaire's, and bump him down the list.
220 2018-01-10 23:44:51 @Dussault_Crypto "Bears"? No exchanges allow you to short this. You're not playing a zero-sum game, but rather greater fool theory. $XRP.X
221 2018-01-10 23:44:50 We love you back bruh
222 2018-01-10 23:44:48 I just don't trust it because there's no real regulatory control over it, so there's no real stability in the value. Like if I invested in GBP or USD, the economics of it are complex, but very clear cut. However with a crypto currency the value could collapse with no prior signs.
223 2018-01-10 23:44:41 Very nice. You running two MNs of one coin on any of yours? Wondering if I can use same VPS or need to run it on a separate server.
224 2018-01-10 23:44:38 Nope. Price is stagnant. Going for a quick dip to 11 cents
225 2018-01-10 23:44:35 @cryptowilson Thank you so much for your quality content. I really wish I had followed you earlier. I’ve never seen you using Bollinger Bands, and want to know your thoughts about it? Looks helpful to detect oversold/overbuy on a daily candle. Thanks for your help $crypto

230 2018-01-10 23:44:11 That article should never have been published- what’s the utility of getting a comment from someone who admittedly says that he knows nothing about crypto? The headline and story was misleading and just click bait
231 2018-01-10 23:44:10 Only grandpas say everything in crypto is a scam?

238 2018-01-10 23:43:39 This is good stuff. A few days ago I made a thread about being a walking contradiction, which is a similar theme, I think. Being malleable and the ability to adjust your behavior based on your surroundings, is highly undervalued.

253 2018-01-10 23:41:45 I wish I could just live in crypto. I hate having to liquidate when making big purchases. Smh

255 2018-01-10 23:41:41 No surprise what so ever, @DeepOnionx has the best product and the best community in crypto right now!
256 2018-01-10 23:41:39 Having a 100% crypto retirement allocation is only a good idea if it means you’ve bought 3 year puts on every coin out there. Otherwise it makes about as much sense as cashing out your 401(k) to play blackjack

260 2018-01-10 23:41:13 You joke, but he himself would readily admit he does in fact not understand crypto.
261 2018-01-10 23:41:07 Can you recommend any good resources for reading/doing tech anal on crypto charts? Thx
262 2018-01-10 23:41:05 @SatoshiLite So both my mobile service provider and house internet provider said they are willing to look into implementing crypto as a form of payment in the near future. Hoping my suggestion of using LTC works out.
263 2018-01-10 23:41:01 Warren Buffet says he doesn't like Bitcoin and the price doesn't even care. We're growing.

272 2018-01-10 23:40:34 I'm in!
273 2018-01-10 23:40:29 I’ve heard that Tron plagerized another cryptocurrencys white paper. Don’t know how much, but enough to make it look copied.

280 2018-01-10 23:39:25 It really means that nobody knows what it is because crypto means secret/ hidden.
Also , you will never know where it goes or how much actual money it's worth. Secret/hidden currency doesn't seem like a great idea, don't we already  have fits about hidden money.

296 2018-01-10 23:38:06 Im seeing about a 10% ROI on DFS but over 300% on crypto so yes I’m investing less in dfs
297 2018-01-10 23:38:05 Crypto is so exciting :)
298 2018-01-10 23:37:56 I never said you didn't. Life isn't worth living if you don't take a little risk every now and then. Like all things #crypto, so long as you don't put in what your willing to lose, there will not be anything to cry about.
299 2018-01-10 23:37:54 It feels like money is flowing straight out of crypto (or somewhere!!!) and straight into stocks last few days
300 2018-01-10 23:37:53 That’s the lower half of the pitchfork :)
301 2018-01-10 23:37:42 The more tension you place on the bow string, the further the arrow will fly.

302 2018-01-10 23:37:40 Hahahah glad you didn’t die 
303 2018-01-10 23:37:39 Yeah, as much as I hate FUD, unverified hype makes me almost as uneasy. I get the excitement (I feel it too in ALL my bones) , but without verification from Ripple and/or the partner themselves, it opens us up to accusations of dishonest pumping
304 2018-01-10 23:37:25 The first crypto currency was RuneScape gold if you think about it

306 2018-01-10 23:37:17 In all honesty I don’t get crypto currency. It’s just not something I’ve been very invested in keeping track of, although it’s fun to read about when it gets in the news
307 2018-01-10 23:37:14 Wow nice tio!
308 2018-01-10 23:37:13 I think it will depend a bit if there is much buzz/news next week about the mainnet. I would like to see $ICX reach consistently $12 mark by this time next week. With the odd peak to $15. Week after could be chaotic with mainnet I imagine! Can't wait to see your graph for that.
309 2018-01-10 23:37:13 You’re well versed in crypto knowledge. We get it.
310 2018-01-10 23:37:06 Ripple is about to be listed(a couple of hours) on DMM in japan...27 million users having access to a top coin...going to lead to a lot of traffic
311 2018-01-10 23:37:05 I’m scrolling through random feeds about #crypto “experts”. Too many follow blindly. Too many DONT do their own DD. #trx #xvg #xrp #poe #btc
312 2018-01-10 23:37:03 Debating to take the test to graduate high school early, would do it in an instant if youtube started to take off. But crypto is doing great for me rn
313 2018-01-10 23:36:51 I’m glad you did because your sentiments regarding the absolutely outrageous attention crypto currency has been getting echoes mine. Kodak has its own ICO now?!?! What the ever-loving is going on? Block chain is interesting if limited on scope application.
314 2018-01-10 23:36:46 I'd buy you some antiparasitics all mah fiat is in crypto
315 2018-01-10 23:36:42 Downside is finite and capital allocated should be viewed already as a loss (ie. how confident are you in your abilities to generate up 300bps crypto loss?
316 2018-01-10 23:36:20 No one knows how the crypto market will react, so this is by far the worst piece of advice #TRX #tron
317 2018-01-10 23:36:16 thats crazy, I have no doubt people will make money, but I'm in Texas, so I'm out. I know I could use a VPN, but I don't like being deceptive like that, there are other ways to make an income than by me lying about where I live.
318 2018-01-10 23:36:07 Exactly. I try to invest in companies that address real world problems... period!
319 2018-01-10 23:35:51 Trust me crypto it’s heating up ! More people are buying it and also trading it . However do more research on bit and lite coin . You can buy groceries online with bitcoin and items needed obvious no shops will take a crypto currency yet .
320 2018-01-10 23:35:50 I prefer BTF = bitcoin fee

331 2018-01-10 23:34:49 This morning crypto Twitter was very bearish and this evening they are very bullish — even some experienced folks.

Bitcoin can throw you for a loop, but as @VentureCoinist says, moving a little slower can help you gain perspective.

339 2018-01-10 23:34:11 This is the best time to hold.  My biggest regrets investing in crypto are selling when things aren't moving.  This is usually right before the moon breaks from the clouds.

Take that along with exchange fees and its killing trade.

351 2018-01-10 23:33:05 Cómo se llama ese libro?, gracias!!!
352 2018-01-10 23:32:58 Seriously though. Did you really think the guy whose wealth depends the most on the stock market would say a single positive thing about crypto? C'mon...
353 2018-01-10 23:32:58 あれは人少ない時にやってたからjackpotで勝てた感じですかね〜

358 2018-01-10 23:32:22 It is not so much a government issue as it is the fact that all other financial markets are the playground of the duper rich.  @crypto has changed that.  For the first time ever people can connect and invest in a free digital market economy.  This is freedom
359 2018-01-10 23:32:19 No its an A1 team with major partnerships
360 2018-01-10 23:32:18 TA charts are the inkblots of trading!
361 2018-01-10 23:32:15 @cryptoproapp how do I add a sale to a crypto currency in my profile?  I only see the option to add....
362 2018-01-10 23:32:14 and can reinvest in new idea that can be a good strategy but i am not a financial advisor decision is yours. All the best
363 2018-01-10 23:32:03 True. the coin I think coming to fix all of this is @goldcoin , there are a lot of new rollouts 2018 coming to include unlimited scaling on network transactions (something to that effect) and no fees. I think #BTC will always be used for market price index.
364 2018-01-10 23:31:50 Huh? My view on what? These two crypto coins?
365 2018-01-10 23:31:41 Crypto devaluation comes after when people realize they've been buying worthless hyped-up digits.

Taking a #sensemaking break shortly. Cheered if Foxit may be the next @DynResearch (circa pre-Oracle Inc. epoch). Shoutout @MGTCI not so much abt crypto-populism albt.
369 2018-01-10 23:31:24 Lindacoin is one of the few up from 24 hours ago and I definitely suggest paying attention to it. Currently sitting at under $0.01 but $0.05-$0.10 for this coin is quite likely in the not too distant future. Whitepaper and roadmap are releasing in <24 hours $LINDA #crypto

375 2018-01-10 23:30:50 Oh thats a really good project I lost the chance to get into it in first place deffinitly well for long term hold but not for short term. if you can make some sale like 25% of your holding to take out your investment will be great. So you hold 75% and also cash out ur investment.

381 2018-01-10 23:30:18 The truth behind the critics of crypto coins is in the fear that they will succeed, and will replace traditional investments.
382 2018-01-10 23:30:13 by end of feb
383 2018-01-10 23:30:12 Yea of course. But do you think it’ll happen or not?

387 2018-01-10 23:29:46 Still pretty hyped about #CRPT #Crypterium! The ICO is over now, but it will land on exchanges in February.

424 2018-01-10 23:27:56 Bitcoin Legacy had a soft fork that erased the utility of Bitcoin. 

Bitcoin Cash hard forked just before that to retain the utility of Bitcoin as Cash.  This is the real/cash Bitcoin. Get over it.
425 2018-01-10 23:27:55 Which is why I haven't invested in any crypto currencies even though I see esteem bright colleagues rejoicing in their ROIs.

431 2018-01-10 23:27:18 I doubt whales would want to sell bitcoin at 4k, giving us tadpoles a chance in buying a heap of it off them. Won’t see sub 10k. Supply fixed.
432 2018-01-10 23:27:16 Let me introduce crypto to Twitch and become even more than the ESPN of Esports. Something you should think about..

438 2018-01-10 23:26:52 Please don’t listen to the trolls who spend their time with childish taunts. If you do your own research (eg YouTube interviews) you’ll get the real story.
439 2018-01-10 23:26:38 Not "apparently", they 100% do not understand that a lower satoshi price does not mean the coin is "cheaper". Or that a lower sat price does not automatically mean they can make more money, since "if it could  just go to $1" they would have millions...

Nos mesmos moldes dos relatórios de crypto da Agora nos EUA, só que com todo know-how da @cryptohm. Seria espetacular. Sempre que converso com outros investidores que assinam a demanda é a mesma
444 2018-01-10 23:26:19 Honest question... I see similarities b/n current crypto environment and .com bubble...
445 2018-01-10 23:26:18 Nothing direct that I can see, but the fact that former high-ranking government officials are moving into crypto is bullish AF. And $ICX is kinda the flagship Korea coin.
446 2018-01-10 23:26:11 Better be a big goddamn 
447 2018-01-10 23:26:10 仕掛ける人たちが動かないと反応しないという刷り込みもあるでしょうね。
XRPは特に謎の巨大な蓋が現れるのでwww
448 2018-01-10 23:26:03 Reason? Other than you like the coin?
449 2018-01-10 23:25:57 Da mooooon
450 2018-01-10 23:25:55 Warren Buffet just spoke out against cryptocurriences. What's his motive? 
#Bitcoin #XRP #cryptocurrency #CryproNews
451 2018-01-10 23:25:54 ポートフォリオの組み方変えよう。
452 2018-01-10 23:25:51 $BLKCF will be the next huge runner. Undervalued and not noticed crypto play. This can go parabolic with volume/news. Global Blockchain Technologies $btc $eth $kodk
453 2018-01-10 23:25:38 So you’re saying he sold because he found out about this, then why didn’t he sell it all? #wally Anyways good it’s ‘frozen’ he’ll earn some decent interest this year #XRPthetsnadard
454 2018-01-10 23:25:33 @Cristopher1305 thanks a million for showing me how to start investing into crypto currency! Since November 2017 I’ve made a lot of  right now we keep loading up and HODL until 
455 2018-01-10 23:25:22 BTC looking out for ARDR Investment. I hope crypto is still around by the time it starts trading again.
456 2018-01-10 23:25:12 Hell is people over 30 trying to explain crypto currency
457 2018-01-10 23:25:04 I would agree there’s a need today for the unbanked and some others to use crypto transactionally. Many coins will do this today ltc, xmr, and bch too. And if those become too expensive more will pop up. I see no reason to sacrifice BTC security for that purpose.
458 2018-01-10 23:24:54 Good to see.  Whole crypto community needs to work together to grow!  Last week scared alot of people away!  LTC & TRX will both have great years!!!
459 2018-01-10 23:24:53 Right now!
460 2018-01-10 23:24:40 Reminder, I am going to be on @The_Crypto_Show tonight at ~8PM CST. Looking forward to it!
461 2018-01-10 23:24:28 Niggas a year ago were thinking crypto is a biscuit.... now everyone is a crypto advisor
462 2018-01-10 23:24:24 Bullish. The Globe and Mail have been bashing weed stocks since $WEED was at $7. Now onto Crypto. #dinosaurs
463 2018-01-10 23:24:22 Wouldn't it work with any company? Crypto-Milo anyone? Bring back the car industry with Crypto-Holden?
464 2018-01-10 23:24:09 I know  lost another 20% right after I posted. But fired a second bullet to average down on the dip to make those gains that much sweeter when we get out of this phase!
465 2018-01-10 23:24:09 Absolutely.  

Sadly get rich quick hunters and con men are drowning out the tech with their absurd crypto noise.

Still disagree with #warrenbuffett...just like the dotcom, this storm will create a small number of superb businesses w/ tokens. #blockchain here to stay.
466 2018-01-10 23:24:04 Dear crypto co recruiters,
Thank you for your notes. If I'm being honest, despite my efforts, I really don't understand what your industry does and so couldn't possibly tell your story. (Be wary of the candidates who tell you they can). Oh, and I'm v happy where I am. G'luck!
467 2018-01-10 23:24:02 Thought that was already done yesterday?
468 2018-01-10 23:23:58 I have got some 70000 Vibe for sale
469 2018-01-10 23:23:53 I high key want you to talk crypto 
470 2018-01-10 23:23:53 Hey Sony, now is the perfect time to resurrect the Betamax brand with #BetamaxCoin 

All the crypto kids from the 80s with nostalgia fever will moon it. Guaranteed.

475 2018-01-10 23:23:43 Grab your $bcpt guys, it's going very soon. Love this crypto stuff.
476 2018-01-10 23:23:42 Ven
477 2018-01-10 23:23:39 if people pay the taxes for their #crypto that will be 50bil $ paid in taxes this year. I doubt you can all pull that much from this crypto shithole and not zero everything
478 2018-01-10 23:23:31 You guys are great! Fast responses = free advertising from me... Crypto needs more people like your team in it!
479 2018-01-10 23:23:23 @Altcoinbuzzio has a great community I think. Jeff's helped a lot of people in the crypto community with his channel including myself and I feel we all want to contribute to the success of this community. You're welcome ! :)
480 2018-01-10 23:23:23 if you not clear ask more i will try to reply and explain as possible and as long as I am available at twitter fed
481 2018-01-10 23:23:21 @VaporGroupInc  don't let Kodak steal your crypto thunder... issue some Press releases about your crypto business!!!!   @potstocks, $VPOR
482 2018-01-10 23:23:11 You’re right, the market cap has probably doubled since this message
483 2018-01-10 23:23:09 $Sphtx of course, mainly the GE partnership and the shitty exchanges it's  on (though qryptos isnt all bad), still has not fully mooned imo. Also $xas could be a sleeper, another third gen blockchain, already has some dapps. Still outside top 100. At 170, so it has room to go.

486 2018-01-10 23:22:38 Goddamnit... bought in yesterday! Lost 20%.... But not to worry! 20% against x10 is no biggie 
487 2018-01-10 23:22:35 Wow! Y en español! Tengo que comprar un buen libro de análisis técnico para tener a mano. 
488 2018-01-10 23:22:27 You are right, but I don’t think it’s a bad thing. They will help grow crypto and further the cause.
489 2018-01-10 23:22:24 Unlike the @buffalobills 1 and done lol
490 2018-01-10 23:22:19 @jsayed1 do you offer crypto trade coaching?
491 2018-01-10 23:22:12 my friend’s entire net worth is in crypto, including several maxed out credit cards and is now thinking of borrowing against 401k and home equity :(
492 2018-01-10 23:22:09 Whats your vision for sphtx against Leonardo?
493 2018-01-10 23:22:07 Actually it does have good and bad both but in a sequence, such as inst buyer will pump the price and dump the price to make profit and increase their portfolio and coin in stock, they always willingly put price up for sell their stock and also dump the price to buy back.
494 2018-01-10 23:22:05 I love when crypto twitter digs shit up on legacy market uninformed bitcoin bears 
495 2018-01-10 23:21:59 The next person to refer to all crypto assets as ‘Bitcoin’ gets bitch slapped. Come on we are better than that!
496 2018-01-10 23:21:59 Let's see our node going to the moon!
497 2018-01-10 23:21:44 Oui, il suffit de s'inscrire sur une plateforme d'échange comme @Bitstamp ou @BittrexExchange
498 2018-01-10 23:21:44 All the info is there folks... you just gotta buy and let it ride... new investors will spread out the OS and we will organically elevate to where hundreds of million dollar companies dwell.. $IFXY I keep thinking of 6,000,000 GET and prob another 6,000,000 of SEA #TOKENS #CRYPTO
499 2018-01-10 23:21:42 lol. Bitindia, the Blockchain and crypto no-one needs.
500 2018-01-10 23:21:40 The old world vs new. Think tarnishing all the crypto coins behind some of the distruptive tech being developed is not wise. Shows how much weve moved on... and same old boys club saying same things.
501 2018-01-10 23:21:32 the problem is that many people have believed in your fud, you know you have a lot of power in the world of crypto ...
Thanks for coming back and saying that you like TRX lol
I may be buying a little LTC if I judge your behavior good with respect to trx :)
502 2018-01-10 23:21:29 I've invested a lot of Bitcoins in $DOGE so i'm serious dude :).
503 2018-01-10 23:21:28 really? you're being funny, right?
504 2018-01-10 23:21:21 lskもそろそろ買い時っぽい
505 2018-01-10 23:21:13 But we're not supposed to call Bitcoin a crypto currency....
506 2018-01-10 23:21:12 $KORE will have a huge increase in price this year and the growth potential is massive so buy before it’s too late #crypto #decetralize
507 2018-01-10 23:21:11 YOURE JUST LIKE ME ETHEREUM AND ZRX AND RIPPLE!!!
508 2018-01-10 23:21:11 Engeli bastık
509 2018-01-10 23:21:07 You have to have some liquid cash available for a rainy day, its the point, you don't invest in crypto when you can't afford your rent.
510 2018-01-10 23:21:01 Lmfaoooooo this crypto currency craze is a gift that keeps on giving humor wise
511 2018-01-10 23:21:00 These moves happen every day, all day, no matter what asset you are trading. It just usually happens faster in the #crypto world. This is a very normal thing. I have no idea why the media is running around crying the sky is falling, and #cryptos are crashing!!! FUD! FUD! FUD!
512 2018-01-10 23:20:59 Thinks seem a little quiet, somethings brewing. #crypto

514 2018-01-10 23:20:56 "Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority it is time to pause and reflect." - Mark Twain.

Mark would have been a great #crypto trader.
515 2018-01-10 23:20:55 To those complaining about #TRX.  you guys do realize this coin was .04 just over a week ago right? It is 3x right now. if u bought in high, and you sold as it was falling then you should learn how to “invest” and how to “trade.” Tip 1: don’t sell on losses. #hodl #crypto
516 2018-01-10 23:20:42 Next gen $hit! According to leaks, Blockfolio needs to update its blockhains before they can list it.
517 2018-01-10 23:20:38 I can finally buy my McDouble with crypto in confidence
518 2018-01-10 23:20:30 They want to work with banks aka government.. Wasn’t it the purpose of crypto to defeat those and make them unnecessary.
519 2018-01-10 23:20:27 Except that BTC was first and built the whole crypto revolution, I see no use for it once crypto v2.0 arrives, mass deployment of blockchain across all industries. What value can it provide other than historical significance?

522 2018-01-10 23:20:17 When setting my mid-term sell targets for each crypto market I use 1w candle chart, looking at previous seasons, setting small partial sell group of like 20% of whole position - starting from second last resistance - just under previous ATH, to like 200-300% of ATH...

532 2018-01-10 23:19:00 Real talk. Financial markets are fascinating anyway, but the added community, anti establishmentarianism and memes of crypto equal G.O.A.T.

539 2018-01-10 23:18:29 Unfortunately you are correct. Nice people are usually very hard to read because they do everything they can to present only what is expected from them. It takes a small snap to act upside down. Just like Charlie did.

549 2018-01-10 23:17:28 ima fraid sec will use its downfall as a reason to regulate the shit out of  $crypto
550 2018-01-10 23:17:24 Crypto is bullish cause the premise is this shit is the future. So how would it ever go down? Will they guys at the top dilute? Or will the pump and dump stay forever
551 2018-01-10 23:17:22 Buffet is unfortunately late to this one and doesn't understand what's going on. Love the man but wouldn't take his advice on anything $crypto related.
552 2018-01-10 23:17:20 You can go higher 30% or even 50 if you want but take risks on indv stocks or companies / real estate etc and a tiny amount in a bubble asset class like crypto. Everyone is too late to that trade. I wouldn't risk much more than 2 from these levels (even that too high for me!).
553 2018-01-10 23:17:19 What your prediction or what do you think ?! Maybe its ok to reenter sia with maybe 0,5 btc?!
554 2018-01-10 23:17:15 Ok so, me and my friend were reading on it but I still don’t understand where the value of crypto currency comes from because it isn’t tangible..
555 2018-01-10 23:17:07 All life engagement is limited to crypto, tech/art/business news and world events.

557 2018-01-10 23:16:46 Cause people are gaining more knowledge about the crypto markets every day. More and more realize that XRP is bad for society, pumped by banks, and trying to destroy decentralization with a "fake" crypto. The more you know, the more evil XRP will appear. Also, no Coinbase.
558 2018-01-10 23:16:34 Im in since 0,00043 and 2 days ago i slam nearly all down except btc cause this i will you use maybe for a short trade with bigger invest like pac!i know its  fast #PacCoin but the trade was to good! I forgot that i invest in.same sia 500 € since
559 2018-01-10 23:16:32 Math don’t lie. $dot is the best bet in crypto right now!
560 2018-01-10 23:16:22 followed them including you thanks loads!!!! Hopefully I learn loads from you all and if i make some profit along the way then thats great!

565 2018-01-10 23:16:03 Horrendous and irresponsible
566 2018-01-10 23:16:01 Why?? I’m heating down to a buck!!
567 2018-01-10 23:15:58 Still think we will dip for a few more days, some serious market correction still needs to happen. Many of these coins do not belong in the top 20, 30, 50. I suspect these scam/hype coins will fall by the wayside shortly. #crypto #bitcoin $XRP $TRX $XRB $btc $eth
568 2018-01-10 23:15:48 The newest voice on the scene with regard to decentralization is none other than Mark Zuckerberg, whose recent Facebook post has many thinking the social media magnate is considering entering the crypto sphere.
569 2018-01-10 23:15:47 @VentureCoinist Will you be in Cape Town on sunday talking crypto? Saw an ad on Facebook.

573 2018-01-10 23:15:34 What do the difference between trx btc and try egg?  Why diff price?
574 2018-01-10 23:15:33 Not willingly. But it may be harder for them to control than you think. Once money is in crypto ecosystem they have lost control of it
575 2018-01-10 23:15:32 The red light is still activated. But give me a few days and it will turn into hope green lights. BUY BUY BUY Make crypto great again!!
576 2018-01-10 23:15:31 KODK at least makes sense 
their crypto product doesnt even exist yet
577 2018-01-10 23:15:28 Starting some new bags in $LRC, $AION and $ARN, all quite different, but surely interesting projects. Let's see how they take on 2018. #crypto #DYOR
578 2018-01-10 23:15:24 I'm curious to know if you've experimented with trading bots and if its worth learning for making more gains in crypto or is bots limited to functions being an automated trading system for someone? just curious on your incite on bots
579 2018-01-10 23:15:18 Bro my life flashed before my very eyes and you want to know about DNT? FOR SHAME!!! 
580 2018-01-10 23:15:16 So is bch..!
581 2018-01-10 23:15:04 Should I accept crypto currency for lessons?
582 2018-01-10 23:15:03 It might take a while opening an account and be able to trade in Japan. However the storm is coming if not today but next week!!!!

585 2018-01-10 23:14:59 I feel like all these retards doubting altcoins are just bots because they are absolutely idiots. 
#crypto #cryptocurrency #cryptonews #altcoins
586 2018-01-10 23:14:40 What do u think of #Dnt
587 2018-01-10 23:14:35 Until crypto can offer a fixed currency it can't be effective. Who wants to wake up to the coins they received worth 20%? The technology has potential.
588 2018-01-10 23:14:33 Just posted my profile picture of the bad ass Crypto Puppy I got last week, his name is Ed McSpread, man he changed my world, never felt so much happiness in my life, and I slide a nice portion of my happiness back into him every night. Thanks @justinsuntron #TRX #TRON

591 2018-01-10 23:14:30 There are two main types of mining in the crypto world POW (proof of work,used for coins such as @Bitcoin) and POS (proof of state, used for coins such as @Ripple)See our next tweets for more details and follow for daily updates! #cryptocurrencies #bitcoin #Ethereum #Ripple #BCH

638 2018-01-10 23:11:07 Sorry but no you are wrong.  Buffet is saying he thinks all crypto will crash within a maximum of 5 years. He is saying he would SELL/SHORT every position and most certainly NOT go long.
639 2018-01-10 23:10:54 @lensshark Kodak announced its getting into the crypto coin business WTH?

643 2018-01-10 23:10:41 Warren Buffett on Crypto's reminds me of the Henry Ford "faster horse" quote. Warren is just a old rich dude saying, we just need faster horses not automobiles..

645 2018-01-10 23:10:19 That's the beauty of crypto. Its not up to congress. If the people want it they can determine it has value
646 2018-01-10 23:10:10 Your going to have a hard time in crypto world if 1 week down is bothering you. You might as well cash out now
647 2018-01-10 23:10:09 Wait... Crypto Twitter are advising coins only because of low marketcap and low supply regardless of the project behind. We are really in the most foolish and bullish market I've heard of

654 2018-01-10 23:09:42 Would love for @justinsuntron to join our Discord group 
655 2018-01-10 23:09:37 Buffett’s right but his observation is as banal as saying that all life comes to a bad ending, death. I wouldn’t invest in crypto currencies as a long term investor but I do think they are and will shake up economies permanently.

660 2018-01-10 23:09:21 @DiaryofaMadeMan hey Ian! I see how you are helpful to those in crypto. And I was hoping for your thoughts on a decision. I Was wondering which coin would you enter/buy of rdn drgn or aion right now? Or should I split into all 3?
661 2018-01-10 23:09:20 If they lock up a # of xrp in the future for companies to use for their payment systems the price of the xrp that remain in circulation would rise... people need to stop saying impossible when it comes to crypto.
662 2018-01-10 23:09:19 @Crypto_Bitlord
663 2018-01-10 23:09:19 This is perfect time to BUY TRX and prepare for skyrocket. We just need to trust Tron's future and his great partnership announcement. Plus I personally believe when TRX will be listed on one of big japan exchange like Coincheck or Zaif, Japan will support TRX. they love Tron

681 2018-01-10 23:07:58 You see, i have grown a little skeptical after some time in crypto doing my research.
682 2018-01-10 23:07:43 It's evolution of tradional market traders/gurus. 
First they hate on Bitcoin, say it has no value and at some point it will go below some lower value and before you know it they offer crypto trading seminars for mad prices.
683 2018-01-10 23:07:32 Let's say you're using a free Internet service that you enjoy (say, a good blog or social media site). Said website needs to make money. Would you rather them have ads that track you (common today), or have their website mine crypto-currency in the background?
684 2018-01-10 23:07:29 I agree that BCH will overtake BTC.  It's faster, which is crypto's bain, it's slow.  Solves the "global transaction" problem.  But isn't better for everyday in-person store transactions. Online, OK, I can wait.  ETH and smart contracts introduce much more than exchange of value.
685 2018-01-10 23:07:28 @Crypto_Daily Your audio and video shuttering maybe because of CPU/GPU overloaded and/or wrong driver and not because of your Internet con.
686 2018-01-10 23:07:11 Maybe my gym should pivot to crypto and use the treadmills to power mining rigs.

688 2018-01-10 23:07:09 @Daniel44 @Conflitm749   I’m riding KODK more real with own crypto coming, GCAP could double will open US soon,
689 2018-01-10 23:07:07 i’m now ‘fully invested’ in crypto - meaning i’ve put in as much $ as I’m going to. I’ll let it ride for a year and see what happens. Can’t justify putting in more, just not as much bang/buck as options
690 2018-01-10 23:07:02 I know man I need more smh . I believe in the project heavy myself.
691 2018-01-10 23:06:54 The funny thing is people will never stop dumping their (life changing) investments just because some dumbfucks told them to do so. This also applies to other markets,  not only crypto
692 2018-01-10 23:06:53 He is a good guy he would never dump on us!!!  I am always sketchy AF about "nice people" you never know their true intentions.

721 2018-01-10 23:04:31 The more I look at the markets (global markets as well as crypto) the more I feel this dip in bitcoin is inappropriate. No wonder no bears are following through...
722 2018-01-10 23:04:14 Or it's so useless nobody gives a shit about it. Bitcoin was the flagship project, nobody can ever deny that from it. But to think the first iPhone is a better solution than an iPhone x doesn't happen anywhere besides crypto.

731 2018-01-10 23:03:23 For economists out there into crypto, watch the price action for some of the coins in coinsmarkets when it opens. Does pricing reach equilibrium or does it achieve parity?

744 2018-01-10 23:02:34 however @thisisnuse's play works if you are okay to lose all of your investment with no regrets. your starting capital in that case should not comprise of a large amount of your savings/home loans/ credit card loans etc.
745 2018-01-10 23:02:32 Most of the drama in the crypto space will vanish, once LN is implemented. ALTs will go back to big daddy.

758 2018-01-10 23:01:50 Maybe it is the same people (or bots) that buy anything with crypto or coin in the name

762 2018-01-10 23:01:44 Picking up some $VEN on this mini dip. 

What else to get on Binance?
763 2018-01-10 23:01:43 Awesome brother! 
764 2018-01-10 23:01:40 I believe you. The US being cheaper is because of export of inflation.

772 2018-01-10 23:01:23 @SimonDixonTwitt great talk this evening. V.thought provoking on what crypto could lead too. Answered a lot of questions I had on bchain 2!!
773 2018-01-10 23:01:19 Primary reasons why merchants would turn down payments in crypto is 1) volatility 2) Ease of usage (To envision a future where even an illiterate shop owner uses crypto - we need to make the transaction look as simple as possible).  <Cont'd>
774 2018-01-10 23:01:13 “In any investment, you expect to have fun and make money.” - Michael Jordan

That's the case with Crypto when you're doing it right. Hit me up if you need professional
advice.
775 2018-01-10 23:01:02 Let's play join the dots. 1. Tron is a crypto for the entertainment space. 2. The company is an entertainment provider. 3. Users will likely be able to use TRX to purchase content. This isn't hard Junior. What did you think they mean by partnership? Coffee dates?
776 2018-01-10 23:01:02 I should find out a way to make a Crypto Coin. I would call it "Latinum" and get all the Star Trek fans on board. #StarTrek #StarkDS9 #Crypto #Cryptocurrency

796 2018-01-10 22:59:56 Thanks. Welcome to $crypto Twitter. Some tips: 
- Try to stay as anonymous as possible, privacy is key
- Don’t limit your exposure follow as many accounts as possible. Information is wealth, and right now is free. 
- Follow accounts that are know to have bears feelings about BTC
797 2018-01-10 22:59:52 Just wanted to say #Respect to you @justinsuntron 
You have stayed calm, battled hard for your creation crypto baby #Tron #TRX amidst all the flak & criticism you have endured.
Its bouncing back and thoroughly deservedly so.
Great job! 
I never sold any of my Tron. #Happy
798 2018-01-10 22:59:45 Counter-thought: yes, bitcoin may have a limited supply, but there's an infinite number of crypto alternatives that can be plucked out of the sky with a quick fork / airdrop. As these gain more liquidity / fiat pairs, is there really a limited supply of crypto stores of value?
799 2018-01-10 22:59:42 本気で情報収集してトレードするとトンデモなくメンタル消耗するな。

819 2018-01-10 22:58:03 I need to learn how to plot these charts. Any good tutorial vids anyone can link?
820 2018-01-10 22:58:01 It's just the beginning I got some TRX  XVG AND XRP I'll get income taxes soon then I'm going biv..wish I would have known about crypto a lot earlier thAn now.
821 2018-01-10 22:57:59 I convinced a lot of users to start using @WhatsApp and I'm happy to say I've managed to get almost everyone out now.

Besides @telegram is IMO a much better chat client. 

Small note: if you need provem strong crypto Signal might be a better choice than Telegram.
822 2018-01-10 22:57:54 Why Eric... why.  Leave Trump out of my Crypto Twitter Feed.  It's the only place I can escape him!!!
823 2018-01-10 22:57:35 no one ever went wrong taking out some initial profit and investment out. no matter how long/how many billions you have? Its okay if you are a little poor if it helps you sleep at night.
824 2018-01-10 22:57:30 An "expert" on crypto street podcast said he just looks for charts that are "rekt as fuck" and automatically buys. I do not follow him anymore.
825 2018-01-10 22:57:25 Good but words like might in the whitepaper makes it doubtful!  Like might be able to exchange in other currencies- fiat or crypto!  Why “might”??? 
826 2018-01-10 22:57:24 Imo #cryptocurrency should have been created at least 10y ago.This generation has no idea what to do with it!You only hear #moon #pump&dump #lambos. Most #ICO are scams !

846 2018-01-10 22:56:06 Seriously though,  setup your PCs to mine Crypto when you're not using them. You'll make $5-10 a day depending on what your GPUs are. I recommend Awesome Miner and Mining Pool Hub
847 2018-01-10 22:55:55 Is this my buy signal???
848 2018-01-10 22:55:52 I'll venture a step farther... wait for the true flippening
849 2018-01-10 22:55:52 Good point.  Everyone is now on twitter with #crypto predictions but where were they (and most of us) in 2011 - 2016.  Sleeping.
850 2018-01-10 22:55:34 Couldn’t agree more with you. I’ve been buying the dips. Good bit of consolidation in this region, considering the volumes still well low the herd haven’t even caught on to this sleeping beast. $rhoc

898 2018-01-10 22:52:15 We are aware of this issue and will have a fix shortly.
899 2018-01-10 22:52:09 Is this #2FA thing like a Mexican wave at a soccer game? Something to do when the alt market gets boring? #crypto
900 2018-01-10 22:52:00 Next big thing on crypto twitter.
More and more tweets that start with "Verry happy to announce that I will be an advisor for"
Not saying its a bad thing. Just saying this is gonna happen
901 2018-01-10 22:51:56 Really ? What do you think bitcoin and crypto currency is moving us towards? Nothing happens overnight man. This is a process they’ve been going through for years and we’re at the end of it.

909 2018-01-10 22:51:16 Why didn't they hard fork if it had consensus?
910 2018-01-10 22:51:14 bTrash - turning pump profits into BTC network spam transactions to generate more pumps from panicky crypto-noobs who are too impatient for proper scaling.
911 2018-01-10 22:51:09 Holy fuck, are you actually saying the CIA/NSA being able to own LN hubs and effectively not process transactions that they decide are malicious is a good thing? You're advocating for gov't gatekeepers? This is the most backwards thing I've ever read from someone who owns crypto

921 2018-01-10 22:50:41 How much is the BTC worth after fees, then? :)

Maybe when we say how much a crypto wallet is worth, we should express it as a total amount of BCH.
922 2018-01-10 22:50:24 Dude, you have to watch it. He shut down the rumors, back off from him
923 2018-01-10 22:50:24 @DividendMaster Buffett would buy a 5 year put on every crypto....@CNBCFastMoney telling him to sell a CBOE contract...If it were THAT easy nobody would lose $ selling Corn.

930 2018-01-10 22:50:14 Well guys, $BCH is doing its thing again, looks to be timing the pump with other world events as usual. Japan will start trading it tomorrow. 

From past pumps we know it has one day like this where it slowly grows, dips slightly, then shoots for the moon the following day.

933 2018-01-10 22:50:00 The more I learn about crypto (Kodak coins?!?) the more equally befuddled and intrigued I am. I guess it’s that way with everything - let me know when you start said side hustle!
934 2018-01-10 22:49:57 $POSW ATH  was nearly 20k sat and it wasn't anywhere near as promising as now at 6k nor was the #crypto marketcap anywhere near what we are seeing today

938 2018-01-10 22:49:30 From reading several ICO whitepapers: 100% of them are utopian, bad product ideas, which nobody needs. If you are designing a startup - product, distribution, crypto, AI are all components which need to fit together. Another theme -- filling up whitepaper pages for the heck of it

940 2018-01-10 22:49:24 Warren is a veteran, but he is also old fashioned. He only invests in what he understands, hence why he missed out on Amazon and Facebook, and why he'll miss out on crypto!

952 2018-01-10 22:48:31 No you are not...
Because feminism isn't insular. It is a part of science.

Creationism isn't in any way apart of science.

You basically just claimed cryptozoology is the same as zoology because both write journals but crypto zoology is "insular"

961 2018-01-10 22:47:50 Not really, anybody can mine crypto currencies you just need a pretty decent computer to do it, get in now before it’s too late
962 2018-01-10 22:47:47 No, no, no. It's the CCN negative story about you plagiarizing the White Paper. It's one of the hot topics now around the crypto circles.
963 2018-01-10 22:47:45 I like the way it is growing organically at the moment. Long term investors and believers are holding and want to see mass adoption.

1006 2018-01-10 22:43:38 I’m launching my own crypto currency  pay attention to the first sale this are the highly valuable artcoins which are set to beat the bitcoins on the market
1007 2018-01-10 22:43:34 I think I’m hodling too many bags with too low amounts. 1.5k USD But so many cool coins with promise
1008 2018-01-10 22:43:32 Is that like the time when Bitcoin fell 90% (from USD$980 to USD$90)? Crypto-currencies will exist long after individual traders blow up being too greedy or fearful. Money is bifurcating, diversify or perish

1023 2018-01-10 22:42:35 It's a critical point. But many still contort smart contracts into being more than merely mechanisms. Replacing law and lawyers is a big part of crypto's ideological fabric

1040 2018-01-10 22:40:49 Also, I wouldn't feel good about holding bigger portions of my bags right now if I didn't have made some nice money before. Would be too much downside risk for me to keep my sanity.

1044 2018-01-10 22:40:40 USDT_ETH price DECREASED to $1210.500100 on #poloniex. New alerts (+/- 4.000 pct) set at: UP: $1258.920104 - DOWN: $1162.080096 $eth #eth #ethereum #crypto $crypto $btc
1045 2018-01-10 22:40:40 I wouldn’t say so. While the crypto market is oversaturated and many ppl are investing w/o properly researching, the coins that will survive long-term serve legitimate market needs, e.g. cheaper banking, legal dispute resolution.
1046 2018-01-10 22:40:33 Si tu possèdes cette monnaie virtuelle (crypto-monnaie), tu peux l’utiliser pour acheter des choses avec mais il faut que ces Commerces et Entreprises acceptent le bitcoin comme monnaie.
C’est un moyen beaucoup plus rapide de payer

1051 2018-01-10 22:40:14 Do you have a set rules for how much you sell at what % or does it vary?
1052 2018-01-10 22:40:12 SHOUT OUT to all the Crypto Currency Investors who are interested in Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Tron.

See you @ the Philly meeting.
1053 2018-01-10 22:40:10 I need more crypto money
1054 2018-01-10 22:40:10 Asking for a friend:

If you owned $SC siacoin, would you trade it for $DGB? Both look like they could break out at any time.

1056 2018-01-10 22:40:02 When a stock goes up X% because of some crypto-coin announcement, who is buying?  Are these algorithms looking for terms or some really specific day traders?
1057 2018-01-10 22:40:00 I know that most 'research' bases the "wage gap" on annual earnings, not salary. The wage gap is far less than what feminists try to make out.

1060 2018-01-10 22:39:53 Remember 2 years ago when Wall Street/ @CNBC kept hyping up the Chinese stock market? I do. Same result will happen with Crypto.
1061 2018-01-10 22:39:51 But really, if you're not in crypto, wtf are you doing with your life?
1062 2018-01-10 22:39:46 Still undervalued. There's projects over a billion mc with little more than a white paper.
1063 2018-01-10 22:39:46 $ioc gonna be big!! :)
1064 2018-01-10 22:39:33 I think thats what they are trying to define and look closer at. Seems its a bit of a grey area at the moment. At a high level, trading obviously can still earn you revenue, even if it is crypto to crypto.
1065 2018-01-10 22:39:22 I'm in!

1066 2018-01-10 22:39:16 We need to be more inclusive as a crypto community rather than shunning the old system. The networks only become valuable as adoption increases. By helping other people learn you are literally growing the value of your own investments.

1079 2018-01-10 22:38:26 I believe we are nearing the end of the market correction the younger Crypto Currencies are experiencing. They have dipped as ETH grew strong. #ETH climb has slowed which, in my opinion, means the younger CC should start their climb soon. #tron #trx $trx #xrp #ripple #Hodl

1086 2018-01-10 22:37:57 It's true. I've been trying to keep a bigger portion of my bags for long term, but I still like taking that investment back + some profit at a decent point. I don't like holding full bags indefinitely especially after they went past multiple %
1087 2018-01-10 22:37:55 Yup
1088 2018-01-10 22:37:44 Man so true... I'm new to the crypto space, and that became my #2  philosophy. #1 is don't FOMO, #2 don't be Greedy. Live and learn.

1094 2018-01-10 22:37:22 I agree. These new folks are playing crypto like a casino. Flipping constantly. No interest or knowledge of the project & what it can accomplish.  And as a side effect, we see such volatility in the crypto market these currently.
1095 2018-01-10 22:37:20 I get that nobody likes paying #tax.
But in response to those who reached out to say there won't be consequences for failing to report #crypto or that IRS will never find out: I remember clients in my law office telling me the same thing about #offshore.

1099 2018-01-10 22:37:05 Eventually the legacy financial system will realize ETF's are a silly way to be investing in crypto. Own the underlying asset and have it in your physical possession or you essentially own nothing.
1100 2018-01-10 22:37:02 y do u have to justify yourself?
1101 2018-01-10 22:36:51 Oh, wow, that makes perfect sense. Thanks!!!
1102 2018-01-10 22:36:43 seems like a classic case of fake it til u make it. Crypto space can be manipulated because the market is so relatively small but there was significant negative press of verge around that time regardless so i don't think that's all him at all
1103 2018-01-10 22:36:40 you’re making a strong case for investing in crypto
1104 2018-01-10 22:36:38 What does this mean? How will this affect the price if it does at all? Up or down?
1105 2018-01-10 22:36:32 My tweet was directed to Chucky Crypto, not Paul Krugman
1106 2018-01-10 22:36:30 It is already at like #86 without being on a main exchange. Sucks I didn't know about this a few days ago when it was so cheap. Thanks for the info!
1107 2018-01-10 22:36:26 Started just 6 weeks ago with a 2K investment dove in to the crazy world of crypto absorbing everything we could and got to 15K. Must be doing something right! #letsgocrypto
1108 2018-01-10 22:36:18 Hey bro… I moved my Dragons from KuCoin to MyEtherWallet this morning… it said pending on KuCoin for a while and now it’s acting like it went through on KuCoin but it’s not showing up on MyEtherWallet? Does it just take time or should I be worried?

1111 2018-01-10 22:36:05 ETN price is between $.15-16 cent during last 24 hours. At $.16 cents/ETN, you should’ve received about 1400 ETN’s not 900 (900 ETN means he charged you $.25 cents per ETN). Are you sure about your friend?
1112 2018-01-10 22:36:03 ICX, it hasn’t even got started yet.
1113 2018-01-10 22:35:59 At least i'm open with my criticism, you know i've had my fair share of saying you sold early, but last i checked you've been holding your winners longer and longer.
1114 2018-01-10 22:35:59 Silly 
1115 2018-01-10 22:35:55 The reason traditional Investors get frustrated with crypto is because you cannot simply "buy" a network. Not only would you kill the network but the supply simply isn't available. Your position size has to grow with the network.

1119 2018-01-10 22:35:45 I've made a little money playing with crypto currency, but I fully expect it all to come crashing down eventually. I'm just playing "get off the gravy train before it crashes" for kicks.
1120 2018-01-10 22:35:44 You know who's salty? yeah, I don't need to answer that because you are shit posting on @bitcoin.
1121 2018-01-10 22:35:43 Buffet said many times he doesn't understand technology companies that is why not investing in them. Crypto is not understood well by many IT professionals, so it is not surprising Buffet doesn't get it.
1122 2018-01-10 22:35:43 Yeah, e.g. maybe we send Accept: application/whatever;v=2-4? Numbered versions are apparently good for revving crypto but maybe less so for section names.

If so 95% of current alt coins are going to disappear. That doesn’t seem that ridiculous based off your avg VC success rate?

1129 2018-01-10 22:34:58 @timseymour Exactly.  Many ways to value traditional currencies, unlike crypto-currencies.  The BK argument does not hold water.
1130 2018-01-10 22:34:57 Okay so here's my method.

-real time crypto tracker
- use alerts
- HAVE MONEY IN A CRYPTO THATS DOING WELL

-Have a Binance account
- Trade when u see a coin dropping
-  Trade out for a coin doing well (anycoin in the green)

This way ur overtime making more and more money
1131 2018-01-10 22:34:55 OK, don't be embarrassed to ask questions of me or anybody else in the community, most people here are friendly and willing to answer questions as long as they think you're being sincere and not playing them. #Crypto

1133 2018-01-10 22:34:45 The guy helping me at the Apple store last week said everyone working there was “investing” in crypto, essentially day trading. Scary stuff. Very interesting long term but this is going to get very ugly near term :(
1134 2018-01-10 22:34:42 to all long-term investors/crypto traders.. take some of your profits (where ever they come from) and put them in $silver.. of all PMs silver will be the one to hodl.. not $gold

1140 2018-01-10 22:34:15 They 'conveniently' overlook the tech when trying to make 'predictions' on returns. That or they simply do not rate the tech at all.
 
But at least WB is 'honest' about knowing nothing about crypto (ditto the tech behind it). /s
1141 2018-01-10 22:34:09 No it's not lol
1142 2018-01-10 22:34:03 question for current crypto participants from a valuation perspective is - would you be willing to commit additional $ at these levels?
1143 2018-01-10 22:33:52 Is there any way to invest in class action lawyers? Bet they're going to have a field day when the crypto bubble bursts.

1157 2018-01-10 22:32:55 One thing I’ve learned in my short time in crypto is that greed is ok, you just have to have the patience for it.
1158 2018-01-10 22:32:43 Must admit the crypto market does have the feel of the .com era when everyone started buying any company involved with changing to .com - I lost £19k on one deal during that period

1190 2018-01-10 22:30:31 my crypto currency trading alias is Jeff "bought the peak" ellis
1191 2018-01-10 22:30:28 Somebody asked me about crypto currency and I told them that shit is a scam. That joint gonna devalue itself and crash just like Enron did.
1192 2018-01-10 22:30:23 There are so many people on twitter who will actually help new investors not get rekt...this phony is losing in a bull market
1193 2018-01-10 22:30:18 @TransferWise will it ever be possible to pay/deposit with any crypto coin?
1194 2018-01-10 22:30:18 The internet is good for two things: #crypto and #porn. Vice Token ($VIT) is combing them both. #blockchainsaysbuy #hothothot @_rking
1195 2018-01-10 22:30:14 Everybody I have spoken to about crypto now holds litecoin. Litecoin is the future for payments only a matter of time before everyone knows.
1196 2018-01-10 22:30:11 勝手にウォレットにエアドロップされてた $INS ってやつが$4超えてるんだけど。。ありがとうありがとうｗ けどEtherDeltaは使いたくないな〜
1197 2018-01-10 22:30:04 This part I agree with.  Anybody can win in a winners market.  A Guide to Becoming a "Crypto Expert" Step 1: Enter Bull market  Step 2: Win like everyone else.  Step 3: Make a bunch of stupid predictions and watch half hit  Step 4: Brag on Twitter about the half you are right on
1198 2018-01-10 22:29:47 Apparently a few weeks ago, $trx paired up with oBike, which will allow you to mine crypto by riding a bike! The longer you ride, the more you earn. I can possibly soon be able to combine these two things I very much enjoy. Unbelievable! $trx has far too much going for it to fail
1199 2018-01-10 22:29:46 That dinosaur doesn’t know anything about crypto. He fully admitted it in the interview.
1200 2018-01-10 22:29:45 You're calling me shit man :(

1226 2018-01-10 22:27:56 I agree. BTC in long term will not grow as fast as the other currencies
1227 2018-01-10 22:27:50 That's a masternode too??
1228 2018-01-10 22:27:47 Short term i think we will have 2 more legs up, but hey it’s crypto’s everything can happen haha
1229 2018-01-10 22:27:42 #WarrenBuffett may have flunked an Internet Analyst in 1998, but he's did very well without it, and likely will do fine without crypto too. @CNBCFastMoney
1230 2018-01-10 22:27:31 Sad part is that it’s going to ultimately hurt his followers the most and this is why people think that the market is a bubble
1231 2018-01-10 22:27:29 One reason I changed my mind about crypto is because “Bitcoin is putting financial sovereignty back into the hands of the individual.”
1232 2018-01-10 22:27:23 #BITCOINCASH to 4000$!

1247 2018-01-10 22:26:20 Anyone that’s a self proclaimed “crypto expert” is not a crypto expert...almost everyone has made money during bull markets (aside from the people that took David’s advice and bought Tron)
1248 2018-01-10 22:26:19 Hey i want to hear his in depth thoughts on the crypto market
1249 2018-01-10 22:26:02 Crypto is too volatile and moves to fast to call last night a crash, it's more like business as usual. If we see steady plummet for weeks then it's a crash. 50% correction is the norm here....
1250 2018-01-10 22:25:58 @LT_Picks enable DM for me. Crypto questions.
1251 2018-01-10 22:25:55 Bij Doge/Dime is dit wel het geval. Doe ik iets verkeerds? Heb je een idee ?
1252 2018-01-10 22:25:53 But.... Can it mine crypto?
1253 2018-01-10 22:25:52 #BCH is on the move again, will it break 3k this time? #crypto
1254 2018-01-10 22:25:49 Agree he is playing himself
1255 2018-01-10 22:25:48 $trx #trx #tron #justinsun 

Trx is looking great up 15% in the last hour, currently at 13 cents and no walls until the 16 cent mark ;)
1256 2018-01-10 22:25:48 There are actually 1401 crypto coins. A lot of them have good future use, you just have to find the diamond in the rough.
1257 2018-01-10 22:25:37 Maybe you should find a different investment other than crypto?
1258 2018-01-10 22:25:36 The guy at the gas station just asked me what I think about crypto. Lmfao
1259 2018-01-10 22:25:28 from the AH reaction, there is a lot of fast "crypto" money in this. Why worry about a meaningless drop of 5% when it was up 30% or more if you traded pre market. This is an IPO story, not crypto. Thin the heard.  $hmny
1260 2018-01-10 22:25:23 Until he said Vertcoin is great you were still happy, accept the judgement of others. Not only in crypto
1261 2018-01-10 22:25:19 Wait what? So many run on , and misplaced commas . 
1262 2018-01-10 22:25:19 Was referring to the pump itself... I thought it had more

1267 2018-01-10 22:24:38 I'm open to doing interviews related to #crypto and #blockchain - just need to see what the publication is first before I choose if i want to do an interview, so let me know how I can help :)
1268 2018-01-10 22:24:27 I'm a crypto enthusiast. I invested a small amount of money in cryptos and am hoping it will grow into a large sum so I can afford surgery. I've been in bad pain for 19 years & it's hard to amass enough $$ for an expensive when in pain. I hope to meet you! #satoshinakamoto
1269 2018-01-10 22:24:16 Is it illegal to sell crypto to someone privately without taking any details from them? #cryptonews #cryptocurrency #Bitcoin #HODL @CryptoCoinNewz @NAVcoinupdate
1270 2018-01-10 22:24:16 looks pretty illmatic
1271 2018-01-10 22:24:13 $ven is mooning today! I’m up 150% on my Initial investment! But I didn’t buy this as a swing trade I believe in the long term success and holding for the long haul #cryptocurrency
1272 2018-01-10 22:24:08 With PoS, instead of the blocks being mined, they are "validated".  To become a validator you must "stake" (or deposit) a portion of your bag. Generally, the more coins you stake = better your chances of getting to validate the next block, which rewards you txn fees (interest).

1277 2018-01-10 22:23:41 Sideways $btc and $alts for like 4 hrs and you degens start this $2fa shit. Another day in #crypto Twitter.
1278 2018-01-10 22:23:40 The fact that this guy calls himself a crypto expert and is long on tron really says all you need to know
1279 2018-01-10 22:23:40 you can just invest in part of a cryptocurrency you don't have to buy a full coin. You can buy part of a bitcoin or whatever crypto takes your fancy. Just research and put a cheeky hundy down lol

1281 2018-01-10 22:23:35 Crypto is a speculative market. Before I found your page I was jumping on trends that I found on my own that you posted about around the same time. You have a strategy that you share. If they don't share your strategy they shouldn't blame you if it doesn't fit with theirs.

I’m presenting this type of fraud and my nephew pumping and dumping as counterargument. Disagreement is allowed
1286 2018-01-10 22:23:15 Guardians of equity markets aka investment banks “record high valuations but keep buying”.. Guardians of crypto markets aka @AriDavidPaul “95% of crypto assets with MKT cap sub $2bn to be substantially lower in 3yrs”. I like the honesty in crypto. Keep it up Ari...

1293 2018-01-10 22:22:48 Why not all three? Great thing about crypto is you can use more than one of them just like you can use Twitter and Facebook.

1299 2018-01-10 22:22:14 Just saying it is not an announcement. Those will come in time, and MoneyGram could be one of them. But he may have used it purely as example, to point to a use case. I just think we should be careful assuming that something is already official, when it's still not.

1311 2018-01-10 22:21:12 Neb is going up, the only reason is not doing that now is because the market is not moving, you can see most of the crypto in that phase, now the one saying is a pump and dump are the ones making harm jus by saying that, Because is base on what they belive with non proofs at all

1332 2018-01-10 22:19:42 No, thank you. Made me a few quid and got my crypto wings watching your streams. Not a man to accept credit where it is not due. Always quote your sources.
1333 2018-01-10 22:19:41 I wonder which will look worse in hindsight: WB's crypto comments or his relentless support for known poison-slinger Coca-Cola?
1334 2018-01-10 22:19:36 @cai_burton @metinilkilic @DrFaizanAz Justin, YOU'RE the main reason your coin is doing so poorly. Pay attention to the market reaction anytime you claim to have a "partnership" or some other hype story..or a webchat or whatever. #tron #trx #cryptocurrency #Crypto #Coinmarketcap

1338 2018-01-10 22:19:17 The effect of the recent sector wide issues with $BTC/Crypto exchanges and the resultant restriction of buy side pressure that resulted from it can not be overstated!
1339 2018-01-10 22:19:12 No you will not. This is one of the many reasons  I always say NEVER leave your #Bitcoin on exchanges. You will end up with ZERO #crypto-dividends.

1345 2018-01-10 22:18:42 The ASIC doesn’t even do any crypto at all. For Bitcoin it does the double sha256 hash iterating over the nonce value that goes into that hash. Very different from cryptography and actually much simpler.

1384 2018-01-10 22:15:57 I use the Crypto Pro app..it’s a couple $s but totally worth it. It tracks an average of all exchanges but you can also look at individual exchanges for all coins they trade

1402 2018-01-10 22:15:01 Trend reversal just happen in #trx #tron $trx should rise nice and steady for a good while now I’d imagine #Cryptocurreny #btc #binance
1403 2018-01-10 22:14:53 2013, 2016 are articles I found of people making a big deal. Obviously. He’s gotten much bigger so people now that didn’t know then are calling him out. You don’t get that. Respect your mental state that pedo jokes are ok? . Yeah. No.
1404 2018-01-10 22:14:49 Be aware that you don't get in a bubble with crypto, if you buy a coin and you surround yourself with only people who also have that coin you will get a tunnel vision, an open mind is key in crypto imo
1405 2018-01-10 22:14:49 Crypto isnt about picking a winner in the short term. But, surviving the marathon without losing anything.

1420 2018-01-10 22:14:11 I just had a conversation with someone where I made the same assertion.  What they didn't like is I stated that XRP is going to be one of those survivors if the crypto-community doesn't come together.

1432 2018-01-10 22:13:20 XVG is the symbol of progression in crypto with a solid team behind it. Its secure privacy features along with instant transactions is what sets it apart! This is what people want and being an open source project the team listen to all input for future changes 
1433 2018-01-10 22:13:17 Kodak, the camera company that is a shell of it's former self, with declining revenues the past 5 years, announced that they are coming out with their own cryptocurrency. The stock has more than tripled since yesterday morning. #Ridiculous #Crypto

1435 2018-01-10 22:13:12 $trx is showing some signs of recovery as well. It seems like we dropped the panic sellers and those who were in for short term and we can continue the journey with the core that actually knows and supports $trx.

1440 2018-01-10 22:12:56 The point people miss about #bitcoin - it is not used to buy pizza etc. it’s value is being the “reserve currency” of the #Crypto world i.e. #digitalgold. High cost and slow transactions won’t change that. Gold is much harder to move around... #altcoins
1441 2018-01-10 22:12:55 I like the fact that Crypto is enabling people to invest in industries they care about. Traditionally I would always look to a middleman to invest my money for me as their expertise 'minimised the risk'. Now I have the same risk but I feel like I have more control of my money.

1458 2018-01-10 22:11:53 I love you Gerald but the fact that you represent the “Trends” Journal and didn’t foresee the Crypto-Currency boom takes away a bit from your prognostication ability.  You guys missed an entire market trend and told us it was unsustainable. Now you’re all in? Hmmm?

1474 2018-01-10 22:10:32 Kan gøres ret let og hurtigt ved hjælp af Coinbase app'en. De har din wallet så du behøver heller ikke mange mærkelige koder og papire :) Når du nu har købt bitcoins kan du bruge dem, til at købe anden crypto-valuta for.
1475 2018-01-10 22:10:28 I usually buy coins for the shortterm swings, but I also use about 50% of my profits to purchase coins that interest me for the long term or coins that I think may be a 2 to 3 month hold. I will put some of my eggs in the #verge basket. They have been struggling tho.#crypto #risk
1476 2018-01-10 22:10:28 if your Crypto analysis is as poor as your grammar, your tweet really isn’t worth the data you used to post it! #ripple #XRP
1477 2018-01-10 22:10:24 The best about making money on cryptos is that you can join a community like this, and every time the leader makes a call, everyone just sync in to buying, that makes that crypto even better and is a profit for everyone, ignore the bad comments and have a great day!

1486 2018-01-10 22:09:47 Hij was te laat erbij voor deze ronde. Hij wacht totdat bubbel barst, dan ziet hij welke crypto een blijvertje is. Daar is hij goed in, zien wie storm zal overleven en daarna vooruitloopt op rest bij herstel.
1487 2018-01-10 22:09:46 Which platform do you use for your #crypto exchanges ? 
Please RT even if you don't use any :)
1488 2018-01-10 22:09:44 If I wouldn't report a forex trade I wouldn't crypto either. They are currency based transactions, not assets. Same goes for goods and services using crypto.

1490 2018-01-10 22:09:33 "It [the crypto bubble] CAN go a lot bigger. The dot-com bubble was $1.7 trillion." A little perspective on the potential of the crypto space in 2018 and beyond from @naval on @laurashin's podcast.

1492 2018-01-10 22:09:25 Dudde honestly, if I had the money & the vast array of insight & knowledge, I'd be actively investing here & there in Crytocurrencies for sure.

The fact that the world's banks are looking at switching to strictly crypto especially signals that the time to invest in it is NOW.
1493 2018-01-10 22:09:23 Bitcoin is Bitcoin. 

Bcash is a scamcoin Roger Ver is using to conflate with the Bitcoin brand and manipulate new crypto buyers into thinking it's Bitcoin instead of an alt coin.  

Bcash is Btrash and will Bcrash.

1507 2018-01-10 22:08:15 
1508 2018-01-10 22:08:14 Food for thought. The latest series of crypto crashes and the low prices we’ve seen lately can be blamed mostly on the recent Korean crackdown on anonymous accounts, yet anonymity is the essence of Verge. I’m worried that the verge price won’t recover because of this.
1509 2018-01-10 22:08:11 Regarding reason for $XRP slip, which I believe to soon gain the uptick, we should include the panic and regulatory uncertainties happening in S. Korea just before the Olympics.
1510 2018-01-10 22:08:10 Is there any crypto that can help hide money from someone or thing.

1567 2018-01-10 22:03:19 Yes but we are *far* from getting the world off fiat, many years! Ppl already in crypto trying to design for "1bit = 1 dollar"... It's not a stable rate, it's a fleeting one. If majority of population not using BCH, doesn't make it easier if it's 20000 vs 0.02, both r unfamiliar.

1574 2018-01-10 22:02:49 I don't even know what gif to post  - just awesome. Only thing I just can't figure out: does it make sense to take some profits as ven is peaking now and re-enter with profit at lower position later or just hold and don't give a sh*t about pullback...

1632 2018-01-10 21:59:26 Ridiculous. I've found the crypto community so welcoming and helpful. And I find it offensive when they say you or somebody else I watch is a scammer, like I can't make decisions for myself. Plenty of times I've looked at something and disagreed and therefore not bought 
1633 2018-01-10 21:59:25 this is a coin?
1634 2018-01-10 21:59:25 ive never revieved an crypto dividens and ive had btc since april
1635 2018-01-10 21:59:22 i call on my great crypto guy @daytradernik  so much love nd respect bruv 
1636 2018-01-10 21:59:17 Sorry man, false. I bought with FULL intentions to hold this entire year. The slide has just made it possible for me to buy more and more, so I'm fine with it. This company and #Crypto WILL go up and believe me, I'll be on board ;)

1638 2018-01-10 21:59:13 micro~some peculiar things around my crypto setup popped up.

macro~so much skank, so much BS? It was becoming a full-time job to wade through, and I am no expert. Just a tourist, money guy ... it was getting too hard.

Returns excellent, I am ok selling early.

I’ll be back ...

1640 2018-01-10 21:59:10 I want to be the latter. I read white papers and threads. I follow many crypto guys on twitter and their blogs. My money is in a few different coins. What else needs to be done? I assume most of these coins will not make it but is there a way to figure out where money should be?
1641 2018-01-10 21:59:00 Shoud buy now. After analysis. Thanks. But luck matters more than analysis

1646 2018-01-10 21:58:36 Wow, thanks for the insight. This is what seperates us new players from old ones. EXPERIENCE. Most people never saw a coin do what TRX is. Knowing its not uncommon goes a long way strengthening weak hands. We need more people in crypto, i dont want them scared away.
1647 2018-01-10 21:58:32 Need to say something about how @realDonaldTrump & #Crypto aren't friends... He is bound to say something about how he is very close with and how he has known crypto for a very long time, it's going to be #yuge, so on, and so forth.

1656 2018-01-10 21:58:04 All crypto is vulnerable. For now, fiat isn't likely to crash.

1658 2018-01-10 21:58:03 Not everyone is at trader. Or perhaps, not everyone wants to trade all their crypto capital. Are we really against holding already? If you get in a MN project at the right time it can be magical. Look at ENG :)

1664 2018-01-10 21:57:39 I understand this completely. I got so many people hitting me up now that I'm crypto rich. Some used to be my enemies.
1665 2018-01-10 21:57:38 Hahaha, sorry brother!
1666 2018-01-10 21:57:35 I have trx and xvg arround 50% of my coins what should i do ?
1667 2018-01-10 21:57:21 Congrats!
1668 2018-01-10 21:57:15 But it could have been... but I’m mostly interested in crypto...
1669 2018-01-10 21:57:14 A lot of people getting in to crypto are not sophisticated investors and may definitely not be familiar with the tax implications. That’s the basis of the article.
1670 2018-01-10 21:57:12 @JKrantz would you ever make a crypto trader bot for BCH?
1671 2018-01-10 21:57:03 Stop investing in people's pyramid schemes. I already see people finding a way to scam with that crypto currency.
1672 2018-01-10 21:56:53 ¿Es cosa mía o todos los SEOs nos estamos metiendo también en #crypto?  Yo ahora estoy mirando cómo integrar pagos con criptomonedas en  MetricSpot ;)

1675 2018-01-10 21:56:43 go to the link, you can put in ANY job type. what I make is dead right along what this says I would make. & I know I make less then the men do. You can see for yourself. I don't think you would listen if I just say I make less.
1676 2018-01-10 21:56:43 Stocks or crypto currency?

1680 2018-01-10 21:56:26 im like 99% sure u tweet about crypto more then anyone else i follow
1681 2018-01-10 21:56:25 @CryptosR_Us George, TRX is going up! Thank you for your advice on holding this crypto currency!
1682 2018-01-10 21:56:22 In crypto land, 12 months then an in depth re-assessment 
1683 2018-01-10 21:56:19 Cryptopia is the same shit...Therefore makes no difference for me
1684 2018-01-10 21:56:16 Those were strange days alright ..... I had a front row seat as Buildonline burned through €40m of VC funds. Not sure FOMO is as prevalent today .... although crypto looks a bit frothy to say the least.
1685 2018-01-10 21:56:06 Happy for you, that's a nice project, gutted that i didn't spot it before.

1690 2018-01-10 21:55:41 I was talking about the technical details?
1691 2018-01-10 21:55:36 @josh_trac this guy reminds me of you lol
1692 2018-01-10 21:55:30 Hi Eric, I’m new to the world of crypto, bought into the trx hype for $200 at 0.20, panic sold at 0.15, broke even again on ICX rising. I’ve now signed up to your free spreadsheet and decided to go into GTO with my remaining £209 as its still in what you call the buy zone at 0.70
1693 2018-01-10 21:55:27 C’est @rogerkver ? 
1694 2018-01-10 21:55:24 I would like to stake but waiting for a wallet where I do nog get Trojan warnings. Im sure the wallet is okay, but.. you cant be safe enough in the crypto world :)
1695 2018-01-10 21:55:21 Crypto currency does.
1696 2018-01-10 21:55:20 #ICOAcornCollective we really need new platforms and project. ethereum is going too slow now
1697 2018-01-10 21:55:18 Define long term 
1698 2018-01-10 21:55:15 Check out @thebeetoken.. whitelist open now. DYOR research.. looks like a great project.
1699 2018-01-10 21:55:10 I hope new investors look at more than just the % gain/loss that is shown on most exchanges

That is a rolling 24 hour %. Its a nice thing to get an idea of whats happening, but there are many dips and peaks in crypto which may be misleading depending what time you look at that %
1700 2018-01-10 21:55:08 Very much excited and happy to announce that I am joining the @Neutron_Crypto $NTRN project as an advisor, and will be helping the team to grow the reach of Neutron and keeping you lot up to date with all the super cool developments they have planned.
1701 2018-01-10 21:55:05 great news, Neutron really needs more exposure, you are doing great things but people don't know.
1702 2018-01-10 21:54:48 Mueller is a fraud. Just a puppet for the deep state.

1710 2018-01-10 21:54:23 Think about where you bought in at versus where you portfolio is today. Are you up? Exactly, welcome to Crypto. High highs come with low lows. It will all come back around.
1711 2018-01-10 21:54:20 WTF.  Ignore the FUD monkeys. They like throwing blame around 
1712 2018-01-10 21:54:17 roll 46819
1713 2018-01-10 21:54:10 Vous penser quoi de l’ICO de @telegram ?
1714 2018-01-10 21:54:10 I agree, i dont like it alot, first time i ever used it. Transfer went well tho, no issues.
1715 2018-01-10 21:53:55 Crypto trading. A thrill but also nerve racking. Just went from 70 to 140+ in usd. In 20mins. Just by keeping an eye out. Wish I could have a bigger starting base...
1716 2018-01-10 21:53:51 I’m sure if you held BTC, ETH, ICX, VEN, WAN & DRGN long term you’d be rich.
1717 2018-01-10 21:53:50 A time estimate from them would be great so everyone doesn’t have to keep checking back.
1718 2018-01-10 21:53:44 How do you feel now
1719 2018-01-10 21:53:44 A traditional pyramid selling scam runs out of new people to join. Crypto currency runs out of electricity as blockchains get ever more expensive to maintain.
1720 2018-01-10 21:53:41 If it was a fashion company, I would totally buy Nik.
1721 2018-01-10 21:53:33 you da man. thanks a lot for the response. #TRX
1722 2018-01-10 21:53:24 I think BTC will stay strong for the next year, more millennials will push alt coins as upcoming generations will need to build jobs/economies after AI, environmental challenges  -may hinge on governing laws to come- BTC will go down over time as more learn/enter crypto economy
1723 2018-01-10 21:53:22 congrats mate @daytradernik
1724 2018-01-10 21:53:19 これにて締め切り！

1727 2018-01-10 21:53:06 This is probably altcoin that even @ToneVays and @jimmysong  will like. Newbies in crypto know how to do it.....man and we were looking and this bloody 2FA for months not figuring its potential...

1729 2018-01-10 21:53:01 That’s very true. Surely there’s a point though where the newbs get rekt and the fundamentally sound companies survive and prosper. That’s what I’m predicting.
1730 2018-01-10 21:52:57 Great thanks Siam - love how logical your approach is. Why don't  u put your silver holdings into crypto if so bullish? (Just wondering) thanks
1731 2018-01-10 21:52:51 Why do you say that?
1732 2018-01-10 21:52:45 90% of the people being extra about the #Tron whitepaper, haven't even read the whitepaper 
$TRX #crypto #moon #HODLsquad #hodl #hodling #cryptonews #cryptotwitter #altcoin #ICOs #blockchain
1733 2018-01-10 21:52:43 Silly statements. Litecoin won't go up until whales move back in it, there's a major announcement, or a mega corporation starts offering it.  Having loyalty to one brand of crypto and being asked to not care about the money is bizarre.
1734 2018-01-10 21:52:21 Yessir!
1735 2018-01-10 21:52:17 Other example Bithumb alone is good for 0.56B+ 24h volume in #EOS, all other exchanges for 1.2B. So this one Korean exchange resamples 33% of the world market and you exclude them? #Crypto was going to brake borders right? #BTC #TRX

1744 2018-01-10 21:51:35 Calling Justin a salesperson is like calling Charlie a Google employee
1745 2018-01-10 21:51:33 I do not understand much of the comments about XRP - not long ago you could make 100-200% profit with it by just buying and selling it a few days later - plus making huge profits with long positions - I am waiting for the next impulse wave :-)
1746 2018-01-10 21:51:24 I've also had no further communication..ill wait patiently though, to be honest I'm in no great rush. I sorted out a @TransferWise account today in minutes, it's not crypto like Centra but very useful to have..

1768 2018-01-10 21:49:39 well because I got in late the majority I got on a high price before the dip, would be nice to see a pump it just gives a little relief.

1773 2018-01-10 21:49:19 Ah Laura-Maï Gaveriaux a aussi un avis sur ça. Exaltation de la virilité violente par l'usage de mots dévalorisants pour des attributs identifiés comme "féminin" et stigmatisant la personne ciblée, typique des crypto-fascistes, pas surprenant après tout.
1774 2018-01-10 21:49:12 Why?

1776 2018-01-10 21:49:06 I’m not sure. I looked around but couldn’t find any information. I also Tweeted at Cryptopia asking how long the process takes but no response. @Cryptopia_NZ
1777 2018-01-10 21:48:51 Tomorrow, I start over with #crypto. I am pretty I will regret this but I must restructure my portfolio to accommodate unexpected life expenses.

1782 2018-01-10 21:48:16 @RSherman_25 saw your article on crypto, you should look at #IOTA its one of the coins with real use cases and companies like #Bosch invested it and working relationship with #VW on #IoT which is bound to be a huge market #Cyrptocurrency
1783 2018-01-10 21:48:14 My whole life revolves around crypto currency. Idk how y’all do that 9-5 shit 
1784 2018-01-10 21:48:14 Most noobs I know are making bank and its passing me off. I want to drink their blood...
1785 2018-01-10 21:48:13 this is funny 
1786 2018-01-10 21:48:11 If you have btc left, you just buy something that had a nice dip.
1787 2018-01-10 21:47:56 Is there any other kind of funky file with crypto besides hash collisions, hashquines and angecryption?
1788 2018-01-10 21:47:56 paid all my legal fees in crypto 
1789 2018-01-10 21:47:50 Buffett is the “Confucius” of the financial world. I don’t believe he would have invested in crypto back in the day anyway.
1790 2018-01-10 21:47:45 I think we'd get a better response from Ivanka and Jared. But I like what you're saying-- play to his ego! "Crypto is booming *because* of the Trump administration!" 
1791 2018-01-10 21:47:41 Is #bitcoin and #crypto a bubble? Yes. But that's okay. This isn't like the stock market bubble of '99. This is more like when the stock market was INVENTED. New asset classes only come around once per century. When they do, many get burned and many make millions. Be the latter.
1792 2018-01-10 21:47:38 Revolut team, thanks for sharing that with the public, it's very valuable. I think transparency is really key in this #crypto space and also some people feel let down by Coinbase. Maybe you could share your cryptocurrency adoption plan?
1793 2018-01-10 21:47:24 @CryptoChoe Hi Eric, in your analysis you mostly use MACD and RSI. What are you views on using StochRSI and KDJ in crypto although they are similar and StochRSI has a greater probability to give off false signals? #crypto
1794 2018-01-10 21:47:20 Many crypto/ICO will fail. No doubt. The network value of blockchain and internet of money will survive
1795 2018-01-10 21:47:15 "Howdy Y'all"
1796 2018-01-10 21:47:15 75% of y’all are super emotional and whining

Crypto is not stable like fiat. 

It’s new and highly volatile 
&
Investing is not meant for hands of the weak 

If you are putting money that you are not willing to lose ..you already Lost! 

Enjoy the rollercoaster.
1797 2018-01-10 21:47:07 That’s a dumb move Crypto is taking over the banks PTL!!!
1798 2018-01-10 21:47:05 Stil don't get the exclusion of the Korean exchanges on #CMC. Example: Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit together are good for 2.5B+ 24h volume in #XRP, all other exchanges for 5.4B. So these three Korean exchanges resample 30% of the world market and you exclude them? #Crypto #BTC #TRX
1799 2018-01-10 21:47:03 Took 23 days for bittrex to give Mme access back to my account and confirm all my crypto had be stolen, even with 2FA enabled.  DO NOT USE THIS EXCHANGE. IT IS  NOT SECURE.
1800 2018-01-10 21:47:01 I stopped reading when I saw a reference to CNN..
1801 2018-01-10 21:46:59 Tomas, thanks so much for the info! 
I’ll do what you did.
All the very best and thanks for reaching out

1806 2018-01-10 21:46:45 Well done!
1807 2018-01-10 21:46:40 Took 23 days for bittrex to give Mme access back to my account and confirm all my crypto had be stolen, even with 2FA enabled.  DO NOT USE THIS EXCHANGE. IT IS  NOT SECURE.
1808 2018-01-10 21:46:35 You do realise that they are all making huge revenues. No company would produce a crypto and not hold some themselves. If the company owns just 10% of the currency and the currency increases in value by 1billion a year then the company makes 100million. It's a spiral of upside
1809 2018-01-10 21:46:33 All these crypto pumps are nothing more than pumps, but if you are a disciplined trader, it's easy moneyyyyy

1820 2018-01-10 21:45:33 I've actually long sold my Bitcoin and litecoin and hold bch so I want it to do well for my own sake but I've nothing against Satoshi lite I think he's done a great job
1821 2018-01-10 21:45:32 Went live today but They don’t start trading it till 11pm time I believe. Hopefully it rockets 
1822 2018-01-10 21:45:31 Don't tell Trump about #crypto because he may buy everything

1826 2018-01-10 21:45:18 was there PR about NASDAQ specifically? Justin said "publicly traded company" and I thought he was referring to Baofeng... please share if I missed something.  I am holding either way lol

1828 2018-01-10 21:45:09 Ik kan er op de site nog niets over vinden. In sommige fora wordt gezegd 1000+ currencies. Het wordt pas duidelijk als ze live gaan denk ik.
1829 2018-01-10 21:45:07 so how does your people invest when you don't accept US customer on ico....
1830 2018-01-10 21:45:02 Number 1 rule in investing... Do not chase! Don't matter if you trading #stocks  or #crypto
1831 2018-01-10 21:45:01 2025 im a firm believer that xrp will be $250
1832 2018-01-10 21:44:52 Do you know how long (approximately) the process of approving can take? Will this be day's or weeks?
1833 2018-01-10 21:44:50 yep. that and egos
1834 2018-01-10 21:44:47 I mean is that a bit biased assuming people's intentions? 
Charlie sold his but is still involved in the project it's not like he's on a beach after abandoning the project ...he isint pushing a market cap to aid himself but to help the community
1835 2018-01-10 21:44:44 The whales are not pumping, this is organic FOMO. The Whales have put up insane walls for the past couple of weeks
1836 2018-01-10 21:44:39 I just bought off that nice sell wall.  I had a buy order in but not many folks seem to be selling.  Just took my $SPHTX and ran.  My single largest crypto purchase to date!
1837 2018-01-10 21:44:38 All sounds gravy.. keep up the great work, loving the interface.
1838 2018-01-10 21:44:38 He admits that he doesn't know anything about crypto and in the same breath says it will come crashing down?
1839 2018-01-10 21:44:31 After Kodak, I would love to see Blockbuster announce a crypto please. #crytocurrency
1840 2018-01-10 21:44:24 And even more to come for $VEN / $VET this month .....
1841 2018-01-10 21:44:23 Oh yeah this is bad.  Between crypto and sports “investing” I’m either rich or broke.
1842 2018-01-10 21:44:22 If you had a profile pic you would be the next big crypto meme
1843 2018-01-10 21:44:21 i do like the price action on crypto
1844 2018-01-10 21:44:07 Haha, i am posting shit all day and hope to be safe. Got what you mean though. Knowingly lurking others into shitty positions is bad.
1845 2018-01-10 21:44:02 #crypto #btc #bitcoin #Ethereum #Litecoin If you are looking for GOOD information on cryptocurrencies check out George at @CryptosR_Us . He enabled me to increase my portfolio by 7x in 2 months. Look up YouTube CryptosRus for his videos. Very Very Good.

1852 2018-01-10 21:43:28 @JustinRecla Hi Justin, I heard you on Skyler Irvine. You had some great information on crypto. Was wondering if you had some insights to the new tax change for crypto currency. I hear that now taxes need to be paid on every trade. Is this correct, any ways around it?
1853 2018-01-10 21:43:01 $HMNY crap topic is crypto
1854 2018-01-10 21:43:00 Ive been in crypto for years and im heavily invested in $ADA. I dont like the insinuation that $ADA investors dont know what theyre doing.
1855 2018-01-10 21:42:57 I really like the idea of Sugar Exchange $SGR . If you haven't seen it yet, check it out. $3m market cap, 80m supply and looks to be the exchange of the future with features well beyond our current capabilities. Find it on @CoinExchangeio with $BTC & $ETH markets.

1861 2018-01-10 21:42:23 The best investment you can make is in to yourself. Don’t lose your mind in crypto, lose your mind in attaining knowledge. Piece by piece the puzzle of reality is going to be solved.

1863 2018-01-10 21:42:09 Hi Ryan:  I keep looking for some sort of new foundation to help share the huge Crypto-windfall that some are enjoying.  Have you seen one?  Want to start one?  I have some ideas.
Cheers, Pete
1864 2018-01-10 21:42:07 love me some crypto. you HODL all year cin or you gonna shake it up

1867 2018-01-10 21:42:00 $SALT is a very unique project. Loans which offer crypto collateral and hodling capabilities. No credit check needed. Undervalued IMO 
1868 2018-01-10 21:41:59 On many aspects it actually ends up being cheaper than Brazil, believe me.
1869 2018-01-10 21:41:57 crypto diversification during a bull market:

30% - scam coins 
30% - penny coins
30% - coins you actually like
10% - $btc
1870 2018-01-10 21:41:52 we need a $crypto that saves us from reply-to-all email threads.
1871 2018-01-10 21:41:50 $HMNY I hope he clarifies they are NOT doing crypto. Get all these crypto freaks out of here. We are worth $20+ without Crypto

1876 2018-01-10 21:41:27 Airswap has huge potential gains!!! All the Wall Street investors will be pumping this coin!!! Michael Novogratz is on the board of advisors
1877 2018-01-10 21:41:22 Oh wait all my crypto currency just disappeared #CESblackout
1878 2018-01-10 21:41:17 Agree. $BTC is weak atm and its impact on $ALTS isn‘t that strong atm imho. So we may still see some various alts mooning. People get more confident with their non-btc coins and their hands are getting stronger.

1880 2018-01-10 21:41:07 He is stupid he will promote coins he holds desperately trying to get people to buy in and hold ... he has no knowledge of charts he doesn’t post any charts and claims he works on them LOL
1881 2018-01-10 21:40:55 It's clear most crypto holders have never heard of a pump and dump... #investwithyourbrainnotwithyouremotions

What would you want on a Sirius crypto currency Coin. What would you want it to be about ?
1887 2018-01-10 21:40:48 Slow exchange processing inhibits the “Buy.”  How about a survey on the best crypto trading platform?
1888 2018-01-10 21:40:47 He is definitely a very nice guy. If you don't make him angry 
1889 2018-01-10 21:40:30 Probably shouldn’t have gotten into crypto. Even if I make money I’ll feel nervous cashing out and will probably ride any coin into the dirt.
1890 2018-01-10 21:40:29 lol cant place pac to sell on cryptopia. wtf

1898 2018-01-10 21:39:57 Ehhh... If you wanted to pump and dump do discord and such. I think this channel has been picking solid safe options. I haven't lost any money yet. May be down on NEBL a bit from the gains the last two days but the whole crypto market is down...
1899 2018-01-10 21:39:52 I totally agree that the US is a cool place to live, just make sure you have the money for it

1901 2018-01-10 21:39:45 Hey, just tested a PRL withdrawal from @Cryptopia_NZ to @kucoincom, more than 24h passed, did not get it yet on kucoin. ETH deposit on kucoin from another address was done in minutes 1 day before.

1906 2018-01-10 21:39:23 It was okay for an initial run. But along with the comedic rapport, more focus on solid crypto info would be good. You guys will figure things out in future episodes. The audio was a little lopsided as well. I could hear Suppo just fine, Boxming, and Crypto Daily not so much

1916 2018-01-10 21:38:52 Nice piece. Re crypto think of gold in gfc. Ppl eventually sell winners I bear markets when all else is getting crushed so as to not sell into v bad mkts. So I would  suggest crypto gets slammed latter part of  bear.

1921 2018-01-10 21:38:35 @vergecurrency has so much potential but the only downside of this crypto and the team behind it is that there marketing is really bad. They should there coin way more on events and on the internet. #xvg
1922 2018-01-10 21:38:34 Yeah, but that's not how crypto works. See $XVG, $XRP, $PHR. The greatest crap can generate profits because people ignore the fundamentals.

1925 2018-01-10 21:38:19 Only reason I ask and just hear me out $PAC is at 1 sat correct this is when people get greedy and dump huge sums at coins when all you have to do is take anywhere from $5 to $100 and have thousands if not millions of coins small investment period #Crypto 101

1929 2018-01-10 21:38:07 Bitcoin is not a good currency/crypto. There is a future for crypto, but bitcoin is not going to be it.
1930 2018-01-10 21:38:03 But you fools don’t realise David called it 3 hours ago even though his post was 17mins ago and he will act like he told you so .... #Fraud
1931 2018-01-10 21:38:02 Tulipmania and the crypto trend are the same thing.
1932 2018-01-10 21:37:50 If trading $dope over the last year has taught me anything... its that after a couple days of really low volume <20 btc/24hrs... there tends to be a major spike out of no where. Lets see if that trend holds true again. #dopecoin $grwi $pot $cann $thc $toke #cannabis #marijuana
1933 2018-01-10 21:37:40 Dont jinx it
1934 2018-01-10 21:37:39 Kodak announced it is lunching a crypto platform (Kodak1) for photographers and in two days its share price shot up. A company that declared bankruptcy a few years ago. This thing with crypto....
1935 2018-01-10 21:37:39 I secretly can't wait until #Bitcoin runs again and reks all these #crypto noobs... $trx $xrp $xvg
1936 2018-01-10 21:37:38 There are scams and there are criminals using bitcoin and other crypto. But the same can be said for the US dollar
1937 2018-01-10 21:37:32 Reading through the comments he doesn't seem like a very nice man 
Taunting people that aren't as knowledgable and being arogant and cocky 
His own worst enemy I bet
1938 2018-01-10 21:37:27 3'5 now seems high. At the moment, and I do believe that to be true, XRP seemed a coin likely to reach 5$.

1943 2018-01-10 21:37:10 If you're looking for #Crypto cloud mining, then please steer clear of #Cryterra There's a looot of hype on YouTube and Reddit for them, but research I've done on them shows they're not actually using the funds for mining. Just redistributing them.
1944 2018-01-10 21:37:07 Lol. I can understand disliking the crypto currency craze. But hating bitcoin because you desire centralization is wild.
1945 2018-01-10 21:37:03 Wow it’s still in red and he’s trying to drive attraction up by putting a gif like xvg is taking off ... got to a stage were David is begging an xvg take off LOL

1951 2018-01-10 21:36:12 While focused on $TRX today, $POE took off about an hour ago. Something  else he missed after posting a video telling his followers that understanding crypto is more than reading charts and that he just uses the 5 min intervals and looks at candles lol. That's why he missed $POE

Trading is hard. Become fluent in technical analysis
Greed Can be your enemy.

1977 2018-01-10 21:34:43 Many reasons. Texas specifically would be mostly because of safety and not that expensive property. Also, way cheaper electronics, cars, a lot of things to do compared to where I live in Brazil.
1978 2018-01-10 21:34:32 @Haejin_Crypto  You are one of the coolest and most interesting dudes I have found on the internet.  I learn something and you make me laugh every time I watch one of your videos.  Thank you for sharing your knowledge!

2004 2018-01-10 21:32:27 Having never read a non-BTC crypto-currency white paper, I just assume they take existing ones, edit them slightly, and republish. Am I far off?
2005 2018-01-10 21:32:20 LOL. Per @GoldmanSachs , "Cryptocurrencies may be useful in parts of the global financial system where the traditional functions of money don't work as well." So, crypto might be useful in remote parts of Amazon forests with small tribes? #bitcoin #BTC #cryptocurrency $BTC $ETH

2008 2018-01-10 21:32:12 Unfortunately DMM is more like YouTube than coinbase. It’s a multi-media site. 27 million users but a good portion of them don’t care about crypto yet. I doubt it will make that big an impact. But here’s to hoping I’m wrong as hell.

2012 2018-01-10 21:31:55 THREAD.

1/I get asked lately where to start in crypto as this world is very confusing.. I can relate , as I started I was totally lost... and actually the twittersphere helped me slowly to understand the wild wild west of cryptro. So here a small beginners package.

2021 2018-01-10 21:31:36 I should buy stock in Kodak since they making their own crypto currency
2022 2018-01-10 21:31:31 I wish! Warren's always been bearish on crypto, Warren has stated that he and Berkshire will never hold a position in cryptocurrencies. I'm basing this information off of a few articles I've read.
2023 2018-01-10 21:31:24 Y’all stay joking about bitcoin but my cousin is legitimately profiting from that crypto shit

2025 2018-01-10 21:31:19 Sir, I think everyone has got a lot of work to do right now in crypto. Don't you think spending time on any kind of trolling others is necessary?
2026 2018-01-10 21:31:15 Yall should check out IFT its the twitter of crypto currency. I get great leads from there all the time. Their token is undervalued imo

It’s a new crypto currency 

it’s like bitcoin 

(yes I am about to say the dumb thing)

but it’s called bitCORN
2034 2018-01-10 21:30:46 I am waiting for the moment that BTC coins are bought above their actual value because they were owned by certain people. Like if Jamie Dimon *ever* buys coffee with crypto on the base layer, those coins are going to be legendary.
2035 2018-01-10 21:30:46 If you look around the crypto table and can’t figure out which coin is for suckers, you are a nerd for being at that table.

2044 2018-01-10 21:30:19 一般的には、仮想通貨の印象は「投機」。
関連ワードが「億り人」であることも踏まえると、投機を魅力に投資する人も多いようだ。

しかし、仮想通貨の本質は、投機ではなく、「ネットワーク機能を持ち、横につながれる通貨」のような気がする。

2020年代、仮想通貨はどんな存在になるんだろう？

2077 2018-01-10 21:27:52 @0xProject es un protocolo para los #DEX, y $ZRX es el token que se usa para pagar los fees al usar el #DEX (Exchange DECENTRALIZADO como @RadarRelay) en donde NO envías tus #Crypto a ningún lado, sólo te conectas con tu wallet y haces tus trades con otros usuarios directamente
2078 2018-01-10 21:27:49 what time price b3 for moon??
2079 2018-01-10 21:27:48 What She's suggestin' : Put your content on @pop_chest too : It is growin' in the #crypto space : There are several other places to get support & financial incentives in this space : Have a look around : Maybe DTube by Steemit also
2080 2018-01-10 21:27:44 How many coins for node?
2081 2018-01-10 21:27:41 100 JPY(BTC): 1182.154 ~ 1184.210 KRW(BTC)
2082 2018-01-10 21:27:41 Did y'all buy that Neblio when I told y'all about it? It was $4 when I told y'all now its up to $40. #crypto
2083 2018-01-10 21:27:27 Lightning code is on github repo, we'll see if they censor or throttle. If yes, then we gonna use $doge. The fastest and cheapest coin there is. Or we gonna branch btc on github and make blocks 32457382500 GB large. Hehe me genius.
2084 2018-01-10 21:27:25 just converted to premium....
2085 2018-01-10 21:27:18 They would cause a great synergy in the crypto world if they ever teamed up.  Better than competing with each other.  Either way, 2 great, smart people, with great teams to support them.  Congrats to both.
2086 2018-01-10 21:27:13 The crypto scene is funny, XRP was at .20c at the beginning of December, Its at $2 now an all the talk is about the "crash".
2087 2018-01-10 21:26:59 Was only a matter of time. Fundamentally outstanding project.
2088 2018-01-10 21:26:59 Because chances are if they were gonna do something like remove the Korean Exchanges, they'd at least tell the crypto community beforehand and not cause a massive panic (Sell offs). Not to mention they'd probably just add a 1-click option instead. Because they're #LiveCoinWatch
2089 2018-01-10 21:26:43 Baasje, hoe is t met je crypto?
2090 2018-01-10 21:26:40 I don’t know how crypto currency works and at this point I’m too afraid to ask
2091 2018-01-10 21:26:38 Thanks for your insights Eric! I just started with crypto three weeks ago, I am +150% in profit, but I want more. I am learning much from your tweets.
2092 2018-01-10 21:26:34 people got bored of VRML instantly.... which is not the case with Crypto.

but the comparison has some merit.
2093 2018-01-10 21:26:33 If I ever really end up living in Texas, I'm going to greet people saying Howdy!
2094 2018-01-10 21:26:23 Thx for the advice “gaming wolf”
2095 2018-01-10 21:26:21 $Vibe, you were my first coin I bought last year on hitbtc. One of the first coins that I owned. Invested $ 70 in you, what did I do? I doubted? I knew nothing about crypto. But now. . . . . I love you hahahahaah
2096 2018-01-10 21:26:19 Crypto boom at 1800
2097 2018-01-10 21:26:17 .@Crypto_Gran have you looked at @gems? I think they will be great in the space. #cryptocurrency #ICOs
2098 2018-01-10 21:26:15 I bought 11,000,000 #B3 tokens with no issues lol
2099 2018-01-10 21:26:15 For a price update, DM this bot a #crypto symbol and see if we're going #ToTheMoon! Example: $BLOCK
2100 2018-01-10 21:26:08 Options shorts I usually take loss at 2x the credit. No idea here on crypto

2107 2018-01-10 21:25:24 This is definitely worth a watch. Great video and easy to understand - also @AmandaB_Johnson thanks for liking my comment on one of your posts, One of my Crypto milestone was hit! Next milestone is a follow back! !
2108 2018-01-10 21:25:21 Too many unknowns
2109 2018-01-10 21:25:20 Why aren’t more people tweeting about $PLU... 
2110 2018-01-10 21:25:14 Not this crap again ... ugh!
2111 2018-01-10 21:25:13 My first crypto swag! Thanks a lot :)
2112 2018-01-10 21:24:56 1円とか夢のような額ですね！w
2113 2018-01-10 21:24:46 In 4 weeks tron will be a dollar, this is crypto style
2114 2018-01-10 21:24:45 50万元手で月20%の利益を出して12ヶ月分回すと約450万

150万元手で月20%の利益を出して12ヶ月分回すと約1300万

300万元手で月20%の利益を出して12ヶ月分回すと約2700万

マイナーアルトや草コインは月100%当たり前にいくような感じだけど、20%とれれば充分じゃないです？と思ってたり
2115 2018-01-10 21:24:40 I fucking love crypto twitter
2116 2018-01-10 21:24:40 What do you think about the #Tron and how big a partner can be, in your opinion. I assume that the partner may not be as large as we would like, given the ability of the Tron to PR
2117 2018-01-10 21:24:40 Who needs banks? #crypto
2118 2018-01-10 21:24:31 1000人おめでとうございます(^.^)自分もがんばろ
2119 2018-01-10 21:24:30 @l_amf même @Kodak se lance dans la crypto monnaie alors laissez @Nabilla tranquille ou ont vous prend en photo 
2120 2018-01-10 21:24:29 Less than 1% of  the worlds money is in crypto, let that be a reminder. Liftoff Is just a matter of time for TRON!
2121 2018-01-10 21:24:19 too many crypto currents in the oven, eh??
2122 2018-01-10 21:24:14 @NathPrins
2123 2018-01-10 21:24:12 @dakotachau this one
2124 2018-01-10 21:24:12 Can confirm Jalak is OG crypto
2125 2018-01-10 21:24:07 @RoidzXVG good and bad, that bull run in January was getting to be hyped up. Currently no regulations in crypto world. No FDIC to protect
2126 2018-01-10 21:23:57 I’m very curious about #bitcoin and #cryptocurrency in general and looking to invest in it. I’m thinking of having a financial advisor and bitcoin/crypto currency guest on a future episode of #TheKasanovaPodcast
2127 2018-01-10 21:23:57 That's a lifetime in crypto land lol, need a way to make updates weekly or something.
2128 2018-01-10 21:23:56 also, how can we consider a lot of the crypto’s currencies, if we can’t spend or use them?? just my opinion and input.. the goal is currency, not a stock #xrp #cryptocurrency
2129 2018-01-10 21:23:43 Those are inflated #'s, 27 million is the overall users. A fraction of that use the crypto services.
2130 2018-01-10 21:23:40 @RSherman_25 talking crypto currency on business insider. Great article! RS isn’t just an athlete, but a legitimate thought leader on a variety of insightful topics. So glad to find out he is part of the crypto community!  Please never “stay in you lane” $btc $ltc $xrp $bch $eth
2131 2018-01-10 21:23:17 Had like five different people reach out asking for help with conducting an ICO, developing cryptocurrency, creating a trading platform or an exchange rate dashboard in last 10 days. And I’m in no way related to crypto world.
2132 2018-01-10 21:23:13 People freak out so easily in crypto,
Zoom out.
2133 2018-01-10 21:23:10 僕は待つ派ですw
2134 2018-01-10 21:23:09 A 281 BTC wall on ETH!!! Wow
2135 2018-01-10 21:23:08 Mediocre DFS players (me) are spending more time with crypto because it’s more profitable (for me, cuz bad at DFS.)
2136 2018-01-10 21:23:02 The #cryptocurrency exchange @BitClude currently has 0% fees.  As a new #crypto exchange the aim is only to gain interest and attention rather than money,  but this no fee situation will pass at some point! 
#bitcoin #ethereum #litecoin #altcoins #altcoin #Blockchain #fintech
2137 2018-01-10 21:23:00 What do you think to publica? I've got 1k on them. That's all I have. I have another 2k. Who do I back?
2138 2018-01-10 21:22:52 Could anyone please explain what’s the consequence of institutional players entering the market. What’s the effect? Is it all negative or is there something positive in it?
2139 2018-01-10 21:22:32 Right, but the core of the crypto community is drawn to the tech of the products, he shows little to no interest in the tech and focuses solely on hype and any partnership he can get.
2140 2018-01-10 21:22:25 Well I have diversified my portfolio to minimise risk, bitcoin is the obvious investment but with over 1000 different crypto currencies currently on the market you can play about a bit. Also separately invested in a company that pay me avg 1% a day for 140 days on my investment.
2141 2018-01-10 21:22:22 In my time on crypto twitter, one thing has become evident. Anyone with “pro” “investor” “strategist” in their name doesn’t know anything, and the most knowledgeable accounts are the ones with animals and Pepe’s and shit
2142 2018-01-10 21:22:19 Its a great investment my friend.Its already x3..debit card visa is coming also.And naga wallet for all your crypto tha will link with the debit card. Superb team and support!!!
2143 2018-01-10 21:22:16 I think these crypto currencies are going to make things much worse than they could be
2144 2018-01-10 21:22:12 #WarrenBuffett only invests in things he knows. And he isn't going to bother learning about #cryptocurrency until its truly mainstream. Dont listen to the #Bears. #Crypto is to change the world. And it will drag others kicking and screaming along with it.
2145 2018-01-10 21:22:07 Wtf? They want your photos registered with them (to protect your (c)) which you already have, to sell it using with crypto currency! They’re out to make money from photographers hard work. What BS is this??? Keep out!
2146 2018-01-10 21:21:57 193xyUo1P3K4usd4bHDqeXTuZ1hdaWxwAX
2147 2018-01-10 21:21:55 So, they are marketing it tyo the minority of the crypto currency inverters... and how would this be better for women then the other ones
2148 2018-01-10 21:21:42 Thanks :p Check Linda too, im holding a few coin since a month, and i didnt expected those returns xD they say they are going
 to release their whitepaper tomorrow, so it might moon.
2149 2018-01-10 21:21:35 おめでとうございます。
blackbyteはすぐ白玉に変えちゃうか後で価値がつくまで待つか迷いますね
2150 2018-01-10 21:21:32 It's a very strong coin. Bitcoin crashed today and almost coins crashed in /BTC, but that was not the case for $ZCASH
2151 2018-01-10 21:21:29 Al how about a PR when there is material info to announce. We dont issue Pr based on Shareprice flucuations . GBTC -9.21 % today MGTI - 8.53. BTC draggin crypto stocks right now.  its not a sprint!. were building massive operations.
2152 2018-01-10 21:21:27 Can you msg me please? :)
2153 2018-01-10 21:21:18 The price explosion is pretty much alwais on the news rumor, not on the news day itself. So no, there wont be a huge "pump" in few hours.
2154 2018-01-10 21:21:18 Here $poe turn into green from long red..giving some hope to stay in crypto world
2155 2018-01-10 21:21:04 Bcash is not the real Bitcoin. Please stop misleading people. It's sad. If this wasn't crypto, you would be sued for your deception
2156 2018-01-10 21:21:01 You guys need your own crypto currency no will ever underpay or overpay
2157 2018-01-10 21:21:00 A few things I learned from #crypto: 
- If you plan to #HODL, make sure you have a relative timeframe in mind 
- If you believe in the coin's long term potential, try contributing to its community in other ways besides #shilling it and shitting on people that don't agree with you
2158 2018-01-10 21:20:57 Lamden Tau will be a game changer in the crypto world. Look into it and thank me a year from now.
2159 2018-01-10 21:20:51 If you know of any companies about to pivot into crypto / blockchain PLEASE tell me before. Thx
2160 2018-01-10 21:20:49 And, yes I admit, I really don't mind making some money during this exciting journey, but @streamr simply deserves much more than being pumped and dumped!
2161 2018-01-10 21:20:49 Something has changed. At a time we were the owners of the crypto market. Now it is more like we have all lost our brains and are waiting social medias signals to move. We just can decide what we are doing with alts and crypto, this is what the game is supposed to be.
2162 2018-01-10 21:20:49 Any upcoming Icos that I can take a look at that allow U.S residents ? $crypto $eth $btc $ltc $icx $xrp
2163 2018-01-10 21:20:44 #GOFL, just like #Crypto , except no matter how much #FUD , you have to #HODL for four days...No idea what any of that means, just felt "timely".
2164 2018-01-10 21:20:41 Great hope to see0. 15-20 
Soon
2165 2018-01-10 21:20:39 come on already...Ripple moving like a slinky past few days...

2169 2018-01-10 21:20:21 Took 2nd in the 5k FFPC High Stakes Fantasy Football League this year and putting the earnings into crypto instead of DFS. So yes I side with hurting lol
2170 2018-01-10 21:20:19 DMM itself has 27 million members, the exchange is new and it is unknown what percentage of those 27 million are going to use the exchange.

2186 2018-01-10 21:19:25 I keep reading articles and hearing people speak about the collapse of crypto yet here we are.
2187 2018-01-10 21:19:24 @Selcoin hocam ne dersiniz ?
2188 2018-01-10 21:19:21 HITBTC no reply to my tickets. superhigh withdraw fees. Low volume. From the crashed #coinsmarkets site to #HITBTC is not progress. You guys had any contact with owners of coinsmarkets yet ? Better try to get listed on @BittrexExchange @binance_2017
2189 2018-01-10 21:19:17 Nah, I'm bringing out the Crypto Universal Number Token just need to work out an acronym for it

2194 2018-01-10 21:18:54 Anyone that uses My Lords Name in this context doesn't deserve a miracle...
2195 2018-01-10 21:18:47 After enough trips there, that whole post office is going to be investing in crypto too.
2196 2018-01-10 21:18:47 Tokyo Time is currently 06:18..

2203 2018-01-10 21:18:23 Q: does it require physical presence in London?

Because "in dubio contra reo" laws on crypto useage are total no-gos!
2204 2018-01-10 21:18:22 I'm in love with the Crypto, got it on the low low 
2205 2018-01-10 21:17:59 Simple Token is raging on Binance. Great undervalued coin! Itll go to a few dollars real soon. Check it out @crypto_bobby
2206 2018-01-10 21:17:47 So a short term buy in your opinion? I already own, but just getting your opinion
2207 2018-01-10 21:17:46 A+++++++++++
2208 2018-01-10 21:17:43 hey @WanderingHogan has a card that goes direct to his crypto...so its real enough :)
2209 2018-01-10 21:17:30 @FayeGrim @RealToniMarie pretty sure that crypto currency explanation didn’t clear up muc for most folks.  Answers were technical- good try though 
2210 2018-01-10 21:17:26 
2211 2018-01-10 21:17:24 Before I formulate a logical response to that, how much crypto do you own? Any XRP or XVG?
2212 2018-01-10 21:17:12 Yo when the FUCK is that @monaizeuk $MNZ dICO on the $KMD platform coming out?
2213 2018-01-10 21:17:07 crypto is from the greek for cyber
2214 2018-01-10 21:16:59 Looking to get my feet wet in Crypto. I'm not a complete noob, but yeah. I just got off a surprising phone call from a family member who is willing to stake me in some speculation. I would like to get some advice from a CEO and not scour documentation and papers on the web. 
2215 2018-01-10 21:16:53 Love the playfulness.    Everyone is so damn sensitive and serious in crypto
2216 2018-01-10 21:16:35 When I see a huge buy wall like this, I buy for a good scalp
2217 2018-01-10 21:16:23 scary shit going on with these processors.

2222 2018-01-10 21:16:04 Doesn't assuage my fears of major Crypto exchange failure. Glad you got your $$ out. I keep mine on my own wallet offline in a fire proof vault w/separate offsite copy w/separate offisite Private Key. #AirGap

2226 2018-01-10 21:15:55 The Kodak ICO is just greed, no real use for it. They’re just trying to get their piece of the crypto pie

2230 2018-01-10 21:15:51 If you are new to #cryptocurrency and the last few days and have not taught you to #HODL you should evaluate your investments in crypto moving forward. You are only at a loss if you sell when not in profit! #XRP #BTC #ETH #XLM #TRX #XVG
2231 2018-01-10 21:15:50 @RueppelRon How did you get to be so smart at crypto!!! WOWW!!!!!!
2232 2018-01-10 21:15:46 Some more free crypto advice, portfolio management:

- 40% Reinvest
- 25% USD
- 25% BTC
- 10% Risk/Fun

Never invest in ICOs. It's a waste of time.

2237 2018-01-10 21:15:21 I just had a great conversation with someone about the crypto community and culture. It was a great reminder how privileged we are to be part of it. Thanks bitcoiners for being you. And the kool aid 
2238 2018-01-10 21:15:21 Agreed!
2239 2018-01-10 21:15:18 I think the whole crypto market is % about greed and fear which is exactly what Mr Buffett is referring to. Buy when people fear losing which is now

2241 2018-01-10 21:15:13 Hey why haven't .@theflaminglips come out with their own crypto currency called WayneCoin?
2242 2018-01-10 21:15:11 I am open minded, I think I like xvg and I had some decent success wit xrp too, but my main asset is @streamr now, I think the team is totally about getting work done and this attitude promotes itself. The possible applications are endless and thats what I am excited about!
2243 2018-01-10 21:15:05 @justinsuntron @litebtc @crypto_rand  Full your bag with $TRX right time for it..Full Bag with low invest and get duble income in a week....Hurry Hurry Hurry Limited offer

2245 2018-01-10 21:14:52 Why did the bottom drop out of #b3 ?
I kinda understand the market flux being up and down but seeing im a few months into the crypto world. Was curious.

2247 2018-01-10 21:14:43 Bond price collapse is getting closer and closer globally! There will many times more institutional investments to the crypto markets when it gains more and more general acceptance. 2018 will be marvellous year for cryptoworld.
2248 2018-01-10 21:14:35 Yes. Definitely. It's support was in the 900 region and even after two days of drops it's still in the 1000 Sat range

2254 2018-01-10 21:14:05 Some coins thrive off the fact that they have a token economy. In these cases, crypto may be essential.
2255 2018-01-10 21:13:37 Agreed, $xvg and $trx seem to have opposite approaches to enhancing their crypto asset.

2265 2018-01-10 21:12:58 I think #PotCoin is emblematic of the crypto bubble. It has no reason to exist from a technological perspective, and it has a $80M market cap.
2266 2018-01-10 21:12:55 @Prezz same here. Showed my wife and was like look we’re billionaires haha. I switched to an app called Delta to track crypto much nicer
2267 2018-01-10 21:12:55 UCF would be a crypto currency.  You would be in great shape if you bought it a year ago but right now it is over valued & could see sharp declines in the intermediate time frame.
2268 2018-01-10 21:12:49 One of my favourite country coins next to the #Gulden #NLG is the #Pesetacoin #PTC which is also strong during fluctuations on the market. I also believe in a bright future for alternative local crypto currencies. I hope I can spend some to buy some sangria 
2269 2018-01-10 21:12:46 Except for the Dadi shill but A1 overall lol
2270 2018-01-10 21:12:45 Influencers can literally pump anything and crypto noobs will buy, even if they have no product or use, just like those 3 do. So easy to just manipulate it.
2271 2018-01-10 21:12:44 Just what the crypto market needs, poor liquidity on GDAX
2272 2018-01-10 21:12:44 So, I am finding it very difficult to balance my long-term holds and the feeling I am missing out on the many opportunities to hit the 20-40% daily gainers! Mainly because my crypto budget is very Noob/low. Any advice? @CryptoDale @CryptoBully @DonnyCrypto @K1llerWh4le
2273 2018-01-10 21:12:38 @Crypto_Talk1 hi mate quick question. If I have an open buy order on @Cryptopia_NZ and then the price increases before the order goes through do I have to wait till it drops to my order price for it to go through? Thanks

2275 2018-01-10 21:12:35 Please can someone explain this? Where exactly do you guys see the decentralisation here? one site manipulating the whole crypto market??? Well,  @justinsuntron is @TRON also going to solve this issue?
2276 2018-01-10 21:12:34 I do it while changing positions lol she is used to it by now
2277 2018-01-10 21:12:30 FYI I just wanted to say thanks for all the content you provide. Your ability to not give into crypto group think has helped me make money on projects I assumed were dumb cause people I respected hated them. Keep doing you, man.

These old ass "experts" are still calling crypto a dud tho, LMAO.
2292 2018-01-10 21:10:35 @CryptoStreetPod guys you‘re amazing. I’m new into the whole crypto world. Great to get an historical view on the crypto world 
2293 2018-01-10 21:10:25 Mostly the BTC and ETH fanbois beginning to take notice the position of $XRP and other alts improving, beginning to fear that they'd no longer dominate the crypto market alone, and beginning to spread immense FUD.
2294 2018-01-10 21:10:24 Shit, $VEN really killin it today. Thanks for bringing it up here just in time @Crypto_Ed_NL!
2295 2018-01-10 21:10:24 That's fair and I agree. If I was trying to interpret his statements generously though I'd say he gets asked about crypto a ton so he will occasionally reluctantly give an opinion and then follow it up by saying he really doesn't know much about it.

2307 2018-01-10 21:09:30 Sorry if this has been answered loads but what app is this? I'm so sick of Blockfolio!
2308 2018-01-10 21:09:29 PEER -to LN Hub - to Peer = BANK. I for one didn't get into Crypto to use a Bank. LN has no place in Bitcoin.
2309 2018-01-10 21:09:24 Ahh sorry thought u were joining in with this other guy ^ 

All i can say regarding this coin is i'll see you on the moon. 


2310 2018-01-10 21:09:18 Only time will show :) Both cases seem valid when you see them from their respective point of view. I'm not fanatic about the whole crypto economy but definitely some of it will stick. One thing being the blockchain tech :) still what a time to be alive!
2311 2018-01-10 21:09:16 #KodakCoin? Crypto genius. Don't invest yet.  Pan-Am, Woolworths and I need your investment for our new #cryptocurrency joint venture.

2358 2018-01-10 21:05:02 Because TRX has been invested in by the scam artist Chinese fuck behind BCH. That’s why it pump &dumped, anything to do with bittrash is going to be a scam pump n dump. But TRX & Justin - I think there’s more upside for Justin doin a gud job. Once btrash money is out, cool

2369 2018-01-10 21:04:18 If it's more of a flip than a pump

It will be the best deserved flip/pump in the short history of Crypto
2370 2018-01-10 21:04:16 What a dropping price for a week speaks preferences? What about for the last month or even weeks before. This is the crypto world not stock market. Not a great pump and dump coin but people preferences will change. Results will show if you are not scared of a bad week.

2379 2018-01-10 21:03:29 How Crypto could defund terrorist threats: the currency is code. Code the currency to not work with certain geographical IP addresses. Have 51% agree to the code change. By majority rule, the code change is played out. The coins no longer work in the terroristic states.
2380 2018-01-10 21:03:20 The power of crypto. Bringing the value back to where it belongs, to the people, to those who speak the truth.

2395 2018-01-10 21:02:11 @Coin_Tracking Hey guys, I like the platform. But there seems to be some problem with showing the data of my Bitcoin trade. The platform shows al the data of my other crypto trades fine, but it doesn't show anything of my investment in Bitcoin.
2396 2018-01-10 21:02:05 First!
2397 2018-01-10 21:01:46 i have the exact same bag as you! .. we are nyc crypto soulmates ... trying times right now, but brighter days are ahead hodl tight
2398 2018-01-10 21:01:39 this is the time not to be emotional as we overcome this red day , the one that hodls will be rewarded tremendously . The korean market is the biggest trader , with their current lockout for taxation. However once their trading opens back up fully  its to the moon we go #crypto
2399 2018-01-10 21:01:36 And so has almost every other alt, more accurate would be crypto market correction
2400 2018-01-10 21:01:10 You know you work for a Bitcoin / crypto currency whatever it is business when you fed £25 an hour - thank you V much
2401 2018-01-10 21:01:07 Yep, buy the dips, hodl, rinse and repeat.
2402 2018-01-10 21:00:54 He is human and so is fallible and likely has no idea what bitcoin actually is.

If he said "crypto will fail because of A, B, C..." technical reasons. OK.

What he actually said was "I think it is perfectly asinine to even pause to think about them." - that's where he failed.

2407 2018-01-10 21:00:30 Kodak stock more than doubled yesterday when they announced that they were going to put out their own cryptocurrency for investors.  Whether the rise was justified or not it shows how much interest there is in crypto in the mainstream investing world....

2409 2018-01-10 21:00:26 Love to see a solid base build in the .0025-.003 range for $IFXY. Next move on crypto news could move it to .006 with ease.
2410 2018-01-10 21:00:24 You should just add [blockchain] to your name with woman in crypto in your bio.. your calls would be taken quite seriously by the community
2411 2018-01-10 21:00:21 You sound salty. Why attack another coin? We should all grow together. We should all be a part of uniting the world behind crypto.
2412 2018-01-10 21:00:18 I listen to a lot of financial and crypto podcasts and this is the sentiment of institutional money towards $BTC according to analysts that I respect. Ari Paul is prime example of somebody who really is knowledgeable on both finance and blockchain
2413 2018-01-10 21:00:17 Just keep up the good work. FUD always passes. Every awesome #crypto has had fud. Once you on @Poloniex @BittrexExchange and @GDAX things will be full of #Abundance

2421 2018-01-10 20:59:58 the volatility is only cause fiat is collapsing... once u get paid and you pay for goods with crypto and fiat is dead the volatility will be gone

2434 2018-01-10 20:58:41 The key issue is Crypto, which requires blockchain, will only become a stable monetary exchange mechanism when a state or a gold standard backs it. Otherwise it’s BS
2435 2018-01-10 20:58:34 Lol do you want an apology? Everything is down at the moment. HODL! its crypto
2436 2018-01-10 20:58:32 Go look at Forex markets. Check how slow and boring that is. Then look at crypto markets and how fast paced they are.
2437 2018-01-10 20:58:22 @CryptoStreetPod can ya'll have a US crypto tax guru on?

2439 2018-01-10 20:58:15 And "due to the manual inputting of data in our ticketing platforms". Seems like a great opportunity for a crypto payment processing company. Do any integrate into ticketing systems?
2440 2018-01-10 20:58:13 It literally says. Moneygram AS AN EXAMPLE.  Your posts are SAD
2441 2018-01-10 20:58:12 Thanks! I’ve put in a bid but there’s not much volume on Coinexchange and I don’t want to pay MP. Hopefully my bid will get picked up at some point. Loving some of your calls man, keep it up!
2442 2018-01-10 20:58:08 If there is anybody today who tried to launch an app at CES that facilitates paying crypto-currency to attend bitcoin conferences they have my sympathy.
2443 2018-01-10 20:58:07 I’d rather stick to crypto that has its own identity rather than try to steal another’s. enjoy your shitcoin it’ll never overtake bitcoin.

2447 2018-01-10 20:58:00 No I sold #xvg when it was $0.24 , when it was on the way down. I bought it back 2 days ago. There are a number of technical indicators saying it’s going up. It’s been 8 days verge has been at or above .17 . That’s forever in crypto currency time. Has to go up quickly.
2448 2018-01-10 20:57:50 I'm perfectly fine with more crypto options it was a tongue in cheek rant...I also think we need more fiat pairs to fight market manipulation in altcoins
2449 2018-01-10 20:57:49 When it matters? You run like God pretty much always brah
2450 2018-01-10 20:57:43 I feel like #xrp is a bit on sale too

2454 2018-01-10 20:57:33 @TheRealWiseOne Kodak is launching a crypto coin now.  When does this shit stop.  Everybody cant just keep creating money, if so then everybody should just start making US dollar photo copies to use.  Govts need to put an end to all this fake money bullshit

2458 2018-01-10 20:57:13 I am a noob to mining LTC @SatoshiLite or any other crypto mining pros, do you have a good article or website I can do thorough research on to begin my mining journey? #Cryptocurrency #ltc #litecoin #CryptoMining

2465 2018-01-10 20:56:58 Wouldn't shock me. I didn't want to defend him for what he does though at least he admits to it. That & he is likely overpaying bigly by paying in crypto

2474 2018-01-10 20:56:27 Then how do we kill Fiat you ask? By establishing Banks that only deal in Crypto backed by Gold. but doing so would require it to be Governed and thus Centralized. Wich... is why the only Real Crypto will be the defiant Coins like Monero.
2475 2018-01-10 20:56:26 Yep I’m in on it too
2476 2018-01-10 20:56:19 This is exactly what I have been thinking last night. It is a very good question and needs to be addressed. We all want the Crypto World to help humanity, but powers that be have too much on the table to just sit back and do nothing.

2478 2018-01-10 20:56:15 Someone else asked me about this one. I haven't had time to go over it, so I suggest that if you like the project & feel confident that it will do well then buy. Also make sure that the dev is active & that the community is supporting it. If so it should do well in the future. GL

2492 2018-01-10 20:54:59 It's impressive how $poe's on the run upwards and is one of the only coins that launched upwards lately and didn't get kicked back to 50% this weak. Maybe because it's a less hyped coin. Anyway impressive and it strenghtens my feeling that poe is a great investment. #crypto #poe
2493 2018-01-10 20:54:57 Even the most successful investor in the world can miss out on an opportunity. Buffet just sticks to what he knows... and he doesn't understand tech/crypto market
2494 2018-01-10 20:54:53 i am not able to withdraw !
2495 2018-01-10 20:54:49 Some days you accidentally use the wrong bank account to buy crypto and get yelled at.

Then a week later, when the funds are available, you've made $150 #happylittleaccident
2496 2018-01-10 20:54:49 Were close to getting a winner picked come on peeps retweet this so we can get it done
2497 2018-01-10 20:54:48 Yeah and when the $B3 tokens appear in the wallet the number is represented much smaller in $KB3 with each singular KB3 representing 1000 B3's.. literally SAME concept as $MIOTA just mean 1 MIOTA = 1,000,000 IOTA - i know this because i own quite a bit.
Are you trolling me dude?
2498 2018-01-10 20:54:37 Fyi I ended up deciding not to get into crypto. Just too risk averse. But, some of what I was going to get has literally more than doubled in price since Friday. Could've been in on that. It's tough.

2503 2018-01-10 20:54:05 When #crypto sells off like this it helps to have a shopping list. Strong projects we can buy during the sale. Here’s my list. What’s on yours? #ADA #AION #ENG #ICX $ADA $AION $ENG $ICX

2506 2018-01-10 20:53:45 I think underestimating the gullibility of the public wrt complicated stuff like crypto currency is a losing move.

The question is not “are there people” but rather “how many people will blindly trust a branded get-rich-quick scheme?”
2507 2018-01-10 20:53:35 @Crypto_Bitlord  You ever buy a lottery ticket because you are killing it so much with crypto that you think the rest of the world works the same way only to be brought back to earth when you dont win? haha #cryptolife

2516 2018-01-10 20:53:06 Give me a list of places I can spend BCH in the UK.

Coffee shops - nope
Supermarket - nope
Amazon - nope
Fuel for car - nope

Crypto is currently a store of value or internal processor.

So BCH is freaking useless and pointless

2555 2018-01-10 20:50:27 If it succeeds much of that capital will be reinvested in Crypto. I think seriously implementing cryptos for DFS would be super sharp, not having to jump through the hoops to exchange to fiat would help keep that customer base.

2569 2018-01-10 20:49:13 Right, the nodes have to continue existing though. That is the sticking point for me with all of this crypto currency and blockchain technology. If enough people decide that the system is invalid they can just cease to operate the nodes and the transactions are invalid.

2578 2018-01-10 20:48:30 @Advisor_Crypto private group details? Thanks.
2579 2018-01-10 20:48:28 Just the top of the resistance :)
2580 2018-01-10 20:48:28 So wouldn’t that be the same for all three of the exchanges if we use that logic
2581 2018-01-10 20:48:27 Expand yourselves globally and stop focusing on Asia alone! #TRX #TRON
2582 2018-01-10 20:48:27 So I'm going to drown?
2583 2018-01-10 20:48:21 Stop with alibaba... it’s generating unrealistic expectations. Alibaba is not in the same field as tron. They will not partner. Maybe something in years time. Alibaba is too big for crypto at his stage.
2584 2018-01-10 20:48:20 We need a current review from someone we trust.

2587 2018-01-10 20:48:18 So what should I consider buying if I’m just starting in crypto? Just the ones listed?
2588 2018-01-10 20:48:11 Haven't used this one yet either ^^

2595 2018-01-10 20:47:50 When I read your posts my positivity turns into disappointment in your knowledge about crypto... But you are good at pretending though

2597 2018-01-10 20:47:42 Accidentally just mentioned how stupid bitcoin and crypto currencies are in front of my coworker. Just learned that he loves crypto currencies and he thinks it’s “the only form of currency in the future”...

How in the world has this become such a big thing? 
2598 2018-01-10 20:47:41 Awesome thanks for sharing!

2600 2018-01-10 20:47:38 if you are new to #crypto trading and you are losing money. dont fret. losing in the early stages is all apart of the learning curve. take the loss, learn from it and most importantly stick with it! you are born to be a winner, dont forget that..........
2601 2018-01-10 20:47:34 To be honest, I just hold it for the airdrops, it’s cheap right now and the profit comes with the coins you become by holding ( like ignis last time ) . I do believe in an increase when a new airdrop is near #hodl ;)
2602 2018-01-10 20:47:34 Anything ‘crypto-related’ screams “Speeeeeeeculation” to the tune of Celebration by Kool and the Gang 
2603 2018-01-10 20:47:33 "If the dollar is archaic, as the crypto-enthusiasts believe, why not speak only in crypto-terms?"

We do.
2604 2018-01-10 20:47:31 almost there.
2605 2018-01-10 20:47:22 He does a lot of give aways never heard once from any of the winners.  Don't waste your time, this guy is praying on desire for crypto.
2606 2018-01-10 20:47:20 OR maybe it’s just one of the normal healthy corrections we see in crypto when a new coin goes parabolic for two days and is overvalued $TRX
2607 2018-01-10 20:47:19 can ask all things bitcoin but that widens to other crypto matters for specific users.

2610 2018-01-10 20:47:15 Buy Litecoin then
2611 2018-01-10 20:47:13 But Bitcoins price will be lowered heavily do to the fact that everyone is buying other coins. And for what? So we can be rich with Fiat? It's a Currency to be HODL'd , not a commodity to be traded for more Fiat and that's the only problem with Crypto right now
2612 2018-01-10 20:47:13 This is crypto, people are fickle. Alot of FUD to shake out week hands, then BTC took a nose dive and alts followed. This is just a healthy retrace from all the FOMO buyers who jacked this up for no reason. If you got in early then HODL strong, if you fomo-ed late lifes tough

2628 2018-01-10 20:46:19 that sell side and buying velocity is super important when you make these plays,. It is high risk but usually gets you a quick 10%-20% if you play it right and have a good stack invested to make the risk worth the reward. Is more fun doing this on waves, takes that 20% 3x+ :)

Nature of current bitcoin design, collateral
no true decentralised blockchain crypto can be cheap+fast while secure+censor-resist

Think, why do we often employ centralised design?

2663 2018-01-10 20:44:00 I seriously don't really use stop loss on crypto currency. My experience is, it will rise again, I may be stuck for a couple weeks in a currency, but, I didn't sell at a lower price. Stop loss for me hasn't done much but sell too soon and cost me in the end

2667 2018-01-10 20:43:46 Current #ces2018 observation - EVERYONE is talking about, owns, is buying, wants, doesn't understand or is preaching about Crypto-Currency #Bitcoin #Litecoin #Ethereum #Ripple
2668 2018-01-10 20:43:36 For everyone who has been in Bitcoin and crypto for more than a week:

Have you ever heard of the scaling debate around Bitcoin? I expect a lot of "No" since I am told there is "censorship and oppression" everywhere.

2692 2018-01-10 20:41:26 Everyone was warned don’t trust anyone with a History degree to run a crypto
2693 2018-01-10 20:41:21 This #crypto thing is playing with my mind. Every time I see a random #TLA (three letter acronym) in an article I’m reading it makes me want to check coin market cap.
2694 2018-01-10 20:41:19 Yes @justinsuntron thank you for your hard work and probably sleepless nights man. My group are all cheering for the TRX success.

2705 2018-01-10 20:40:27 there is nothing for Twitter users?
2706 2018-01-10 20:40:27 Why are they excluding Korea?
2707 2018-01-10 20:40:24 I will give away $100 in my crypto discord where I help people with crypto  if I win lol
2708 2018-01-10 20:40:20 Just read the  TON white paper.  It looks super interesting.  In fact, it may be the first ICO I have ever invested in.  However one thing I would require more information on is. 1/2
2709 2018-01-10 20:40:15 Really complex question, I think its probably a net negative for DFS I just don't see a ton of people going Crypto->DFS but I can see a ton going DFS->Crypto.  And too many factors causing capitol to flow away from DFS to Crypto imo.
2710 2018-01-10 20:40:13 An interesting #Bitcoin fact. The electricity required annually by the world’s bitcoin and crypto-currency miners is equal to Argentina’s annual consumption or 0.6% of the world output annually. Given #Eskom’s sky high charges no wonder Bitcoin costs so much.

2715 2018-01-10 20:39:58 There is 100's billions of dollars coming into the $btc and #crypto market but even more than that, there are trillions of dollars on the sidelines but the market is too small and there is no medium for them to enter.

2722 2018-01-10 20:39:40 At the local coffee shop checking my Crypto like a true douche
2723 2018-01-10 20:39:37 Gah. That's the part I hate the most.
2724 2018-01-10 20:39:35 Since smart contracts are immutable, the margin for error is practically non-existent. Simple mistakes in a deployed smart contract are likely to be exploited by malicious users who do not lack incentives considering the ever-increasing monetary value of crypto.

2726 2018-01-10 20:39:09 Another amazing day in Crypto! the markets are challenging these last few days -- is king bitcoin still consolidating?
2727 2018-01-10 20:39:02 bitcoin FXはロング(先に買い後で売る)で行う方が安全。多少高く買ってしまっても，待っていればもっと高く売れるのだから。逆に先に売ると，安く買い戻そうとしても相場がもうそのレベルに戻ってこない。大損する前に買い戻すこと。コインは減ったままだが，円での価値は取り戻せる。
2728 2018-01-10 20:39:01 I’ve been running several $MUE masternode shares for a couple weeks. Really happy with the results so far.

2740 2018-01-10 20:38:24 Ask the IRS if Cryptos are money. I think their answer is a Yuuuuuge NOoooooo. You pay tax on every transaction with crypto coins if I've be reading things correctly. That is because they aren't classified as money.

2742 2018-01-10 20:38:15 I recently got into crypto a month ago and did a lot of research on a decent amount of coins and only a few stood out but eng ended up being 50% of my portfolio and I won’t be looking back.
2743 2018-01-10 20:38:13 Been listening to a bootcamp on crypto currencies. Far from being a 'currency' they sound like high risk investments in the same class as options and futures. @PaulTeagueUK
2744 2018-01-10 20:38:09 I wish, bad timing with the day job :(

2751 2018-01-10 20:37:33 I hearth 18% of private "investors" are get in debt to invest in crypto. Sounds high to me.
2752 2018-01-10 20:37:30 It is. But I was there when I could have bought a Dash masternode for 20k , now it worth a million+ so...it might be worth it
2753 2018-01-10 20:37:28 Agreed.  Earlier when BTC was around 13,500 I saw huge bidders coming in.  I think big players are ready to throw money back into the crypto sector and push both BTC and crypto stocks up.  DPW and a few other crypto stocks are up pretty big.  They ran it down to push it up...
2754 2018-01-10 20:37:24 Please explain what’s wrong with Cardano
2755 2018-01-10 20:37:21 Warren is great, but is too outdated to grasp the relevance of crypto currency. If he would, he would come around. Look at Jamie Diamond
2756 2018-01-10 20:37:13 The only #crypto that’s not exorbitantly overvalued is the only one with real customers, best use case, and likely to have tens of billions pouring into it soon. I’m talking about #Ripple $XRP. 

Meanwhile $SPANK is up 12% today. Crypto is hilarious.

2757 2018-01-10 20:37:05 What keeps the Bilderberg Group from printing out money from the central banks to make sure that they own enough crypto to contour the market and then crashing it when we put all our money in?
2758 2018-01-10 20:36:57 It is shit coin like most of the coins. I'm talking about manipulation in crypto world which is used to make people buy coins which has no real many than just useless story told behind it tl manipulate people to buy it

2767 2018-01-10 20:36:13 Only if you choose to view it like that. One has nothing to do with the other technically speaking at all. I don't have to play DFS to be able to get into Crypto and vice versa.
2768 2018-01-10 20:36:10 That looks concerning lol
2769 2018-01-10 20:36:08 @NNgroup for being a user experience research group, you have the ugliest fucking website I've ever seen. Take some of your own advice goddamn
2770 2018-01-10 20:36:06 I've watched a couple of the videos and have a couple of questions about how some of the things translate into crypto. Could I PM you possibly ?
2771 2018-01-10 20:35:59 The govt should create a crypto coin out of thin air (i.e. a wallCoin ICO) and use that to fund the wall
2772 2018-01-10 20:35:58 J'ai trop envie de me lancer dans la crypto mais je préfère attendre d'avoir un salaire :(
2773 2018-01-10 20:35:53 They can talk about their cheap fast fees all day  however they'll still have to wait 10 mins & the fees will only go up with more users, ntm less security as they expand the blocksize. Crypto will probably get big enough to prove this on BCH without effecting Bitcoin too much.

2793 2018-01-10 20:34:15 The point you made in your video today was solid. We all need to think about diversifying out of crypto with some of the massive gains. Your not really diversified if all of your capital is working in one asset class.

2797 2018-01-10 20:34:00 Idk how it could help. Unless you are trying to quickly make a buck and then throw profits in dfs? I’m currently investing 50% of my liquid funds in crypto which would be on dfs sites most likely.
2798 2018-01-10 20:33:51 Tried a few #trades lately. Some worked out, some didnt, learned a lot. Main one, and quite obvious looking back, maintain a minimum liquidity for when the market corrects. Bigger corrections, bigger opportunities #Crypto

2822 2018-01-10 20:32:12 Just did the same.
2823 2018-01-10 20:32:09 Where does your opinion come from? Since when have you been for years in the crypto market?
2824 2018-01-10 20:32:08 What's up @officialmcafee , what do you think about this new crypto currency called "Electroneum". Do you consider it has future?
2825 2018-01-10 20:32:02 Have you heard of the Popular Science Effect? Everything outside of my field is interesting but in my field of expertise I realize they are totally wrong...which makes me wonder about the other articles. Same for news these days. Eg getting crypto news from CNN=bad idea
2826 2018-01-10 20:32:01 What's crypto
2827 2018-01-10 20:32:01 Crypto libraries’ automated test suites (you *do* have them right?) should test known vulnerabilities too, for demonstration of the limits and what usage patterns are dangerous

2831 2018-01-10 20:31:30 Similarly, http rests on tcp/ip layer.
2832 2018-01-10 20:31:21 Bitcoin Maximalism is a joke. To say crypto will grow to disrupt the world and only Bitcoin will do it is borderline insane. Does that mean ETH or others will do it? Who knows. It's far too early to be confident about any of these assets. Yet you maximalists are certain 
2833 2018-01-10 20:31:20 Mine deposit was stuck from coinexchange 1 week long, but finally come into coinsmarkets, from wolf to bear, ahhh. but I can login too and see my btc deposited here

2837 2018-01-10 20:31:08 DFS entry is still much easier - just deposit money and you are done. Getting into crypto creates a barrier.

2842 2018-01-10 20:30:58 Hurts... I emptied my accounts and moved it all to Crypto.

2844 2018-01-10 20:30:53 With your shitty customer service I'm sure the imposter is more efficient, close this exchange already and stop ripping people off by keeping our deposits for yourselves, please fe for bankruptcy  and stop giving crypto a bad name with your useless services

I want the analysis without the rhetoric. Anything that spends words on "non standard crypto" and berating people for even considering it is not analysis.
2853 2018-01-10 20:30:23 @crypto_jew28 I wonder if you could help a bunch of us that bought these Ledger Nano S.  They no longer turn on.  At least a dozen have complained online and yet no response.... Please if you can help
2854 2018-01-10 20:30:16 Helping. DFS and poker players are invested in Crypto more than ave American.
2855 2018-01-10 20:30:16 Crypto currencies have extremely low moats.

You can switch all your holdings to a different currency in minutes.

May the highest value currency win.
2856 2018-01-10 20:30:15 And have you heard of digitex ico ? it suddenly popped up on my youtube many youtubers hyping it as the new electroneum , is it just paid hype for ref and stuff or is it legit ?
2857 2018-01-10 20:30:11 To us, crypto is kind of like DFS. You make an investment into _____ and hope it goes well when you watch it unfold. It's educated guessing, just like daily fantasy.
2858 2018-01-10 20:30:01 Yes sir. One of the most advanced and respected projects in the tech world right now imo - nevermind crypto this is bigger than that. Same with $ICX
2859 2018-01-10 20:29:54 From my small group of dfs players (around 20) only me and another are invested in crypto. So I would have to say no effect

2866 2018-01-10 20:29:20 Here's an analogy. #btc is distributed ledger, a protocol that enables decentralized p2p payments. Just like http is a comm protocol that enables communication over the wire. But upper layer solutions like app servers/rest/websockets on top of http make internet what it is today
2867 2018-01-10 20:29:20 @MacroScope17 having said this: I do appreciate your thoughts that you tweet alot and use if often for reviewing other one's statements on crypto's! Thank you and I hope you keep on doing what you do :).

2880 2018-01-10 20:28:14 The crypto-craze is for the most part a reflection of the public's frustration with late tech IPOs.

2894 2018-01-10 20:27:05 The most important thing when you wanna get into crypto is to have good sources of information.

Twitter is my n°1. For now I'm following less than 20 people, but it's enough to have good info and learn a lot.
2895 2018-01-10 20:27:04 Buffett hated tech stocks, never would have invested in Amazon or Google, never did, and guess what, now the top blue chip companies out there are blue chip tech. He just hates on what he doesn't get. admits that, so its probably a more bullish sign for crypto than anything else.
2896 2018-01-10 20:26:58 The Kodak crypto deal is exactly the reason I'm not sold on Bitcoin or cryptocurrency fever.
2897 2018-01-10 20:26:57 What is the future of crypto? Are you staying informed?
2898 2018-01-10 20:26:55 $TRX looks like it's moved into the 3rd wave. Could be going up if you are confident in scalping some profit (be confident).

Full disclosure : I bought back in around 747, 800. I'm looking for a quick 15-20% on each.

2900 2018-01-10 20:26:53 Sorry, misinterpreted it, just followed back xD
2901 2018-01-10 20:26:35 1) Rule #3 in #Crypto - A new asset class calls for a new investment outlook. The metrics used for traditional investing strategies (market cap valuation, predictive pricing) are not applicable in the same way to #cryptoassets.
2902 2018-01-10 20:26:33 It definitely is a bit of a gamble. I'd say wait for the breakout for the safest bet. Don't forget two thing: 1) TA does not predict an outcome, rather it gives you an edge, 2) $XVG already went like 2000x, so beware..
2903 2018-01-10 20:26:30 *sigh* dude theres only 620,000,000 tokens now, its all done and dusted. There is/was nothing to worry about.

2908 2018-01-10 20:26:23 Alright
2909 2018-01-10 20:26:22 If #btc community wants World-wide adoption, then it abdolutely needs second layer solutions. 10 min / block confirmation or centralized mining due to big blocks ain't gonna cut it.

2914 2018-01-10 20:26:01 So glad someone like yourself is shedding light onto the project. It's the most legit one I've come across so far in crypto.
2915 2018-01-10 20:25:54 It’s a shame Buffett is always negative on tech investing

...cause I think Ben Graham would see a lot of cigar butts right now in the crypto currency space

2918 2018-01-10 20:25:43 In a meetup of the crypto currency and blockchain, large majority of people I talked with was those who asking to join an ICO project... And most of them is just a garbage or scammer, which is really annoying...

2925 2018-01-10 20:25:31 On a crypto exchange. Lots of other currencies that will be better investment though.

2932 2018-01-10 20:25:09 In a world almost completely based on data, the necessity of non duplicable numbers(data) will become apparent early enough. Some understand its value now , some might take time. But the people furthest disconnected from crypto at the moment will make it succeed in the end.

2937 2018-01-10 20:24:53 the volume on $ETC is stupid. everyone and their mother on crypto twitter are in it.
2938 2018-01-10 20:24:48 Holy. Yeah :-( thanks for response!
2939 2018-01-10 20:24:48 Video will be up shortly as promised! Thank you guys for all the support! Really starting to grow.
2940 2018-01-10 20:24:39 hype about self-driving cars, so 2017. In 2018, we only care about crypto & blockchain and the pretend $millions they create.
2941 2018-01-10 20:24:32 結局、直近のテーマは規制かな。最近、ボリュームも増えて来たし、段々、政府も見過ごせなくなって来ている様に見える。

年も明けたし、4月のG20に向けて少しづつ規制関連のニュースが増えて来るのかな。

完全に規制なんて出来ないし、時代の流れには逆らえないけど。
2942 2018-01-10 20:24:30 What is your short term expectation? And also, what do you think about AST?
2943 2018-01-10 20:24:17 $trx #trx #tron $trx #tronix signs an agreement with a company that has as many users as 3/4 of the entire population of the United States and the stock doesn't move... are Americans that stupid? That's the biggest agreement I believe in crypto history?
2944 2018-01-10 20:23:54 Only just managed to watch todays show @MichaelSuppo @boxmining , would tag Crypto Daily but can't find him on here, but it was great! As for challenge, choose a coin each for the week, the worse performing coin that person should have to eat a raw Chilli. #cryptocurrency #Crypto
2945 2018-01-10 20:23:53 LOL!
2946 2018-01-10 20:23:51 A lot of new crypto investors worrying cause they bought XRP at the top. So far 2018 has been a case example of crypto volatility. HODL, take a big loss, or buy the dip.
2947 2018-01-10 20:23:43 Expecting massive @CampusCoinORG March Madness related marketing. Maybe crypto themed tournament bracket promotion sponsored by $cmpco!? 
2948 2018-01-10 20:23:37 The most ambitious project in recent times. I recommend everyone to take part in the ICO, you can earn a lot of money. #ICO #P2PSF #Crypto #Altcoin #Blockchain
2949 2018-01-10 20:23:36 If $TRX and $ADA can do it, no reason $VEN can't crack the top 10. Re-branding next week and more partnership announcements toward the end of the month

2950 2018-01-10 20:23:36 Thread on my recent trip to Rwanda.

I went there after saving from my crypto gains with high expectations and left over whelmed having to extend my trip.
2951 2018-01-10 20:23:36 Just read Ripple is getting sued for 10billion dollars.. Ugh
2952 2018-01-10 20:23:32 en me prenant pour un idiot parce que je dis que faire un x10 ne veut rien dire dans le monde des cryptos puisqu'un shitcoin comme Macron a fait *170, peut importe la manière, le Lamden peut aussi avoir été manipulé par ces mêmes méthodes
2953 2018-01-10 20:23:26 Awesome!
2954 2018-01-10 20:23:23 Wall street to dump bonuses on crypto 15th of Jan 2018 
2955 2018-01-10 20:23:16 Masternodes.
ERC20 token with masternodes? People will hype it so hard.
Then you fund it with an ICO. Uncapped.
Billions will be raised.
2956 2018-01-10 20:23:11 FUD about all the other crypto then, and check the article, you can found the new.
It's easy to explain, lot of people like you don't pick it cheap, know about the potential of $TRX, and FUD it for pick some bargains. Too old system, but works with the people.
2957 2018-01-10 20:23:11 coming from a risk averse trader known for value trading and not speculative…which crypto trading is
2958 2018-01-10 20:23:08 thinking about how "turn" in debt portfolios might be applied while investing in cryptos right now. it is not something equity traders/investors come across naturally. perhaps why some of the better traders in crypto I have seen so far are fixed income peeps not fx or equities.
2959 2018-01-10 20:23:03 Such a sweet girl
2960 2018-01-10 20:23:00 men are far surpassing women in computer based tec and business and investing like crypto i have seen like one women entrepreneur that is something most women dont understand or are down with sales online or how to do it really, some people arent programed to do it i guess

2993 2018-01-10 20:20:02 This is fantastic. Thank you.
2994 2018-01-10 20:19:54 Bitcoiners are scared of losing their crypto reserve currency privilege so they're lashing out at cryptocurrency minorities they deem threats like ETH.

I call it Bitcoin Maximalist Fragility.
2995 2018-01-10 20:19:50 What are other sites that trade crypto? I wish I had tapped in on vibe coin before binance started trading today. 
2996 2018-01-10 20:19:49 Calm down ,, we know we know ,, if ur a Devo than u should help, but if you are just an investor all u really could do is wait .. no need for negativity ..

3005 2018-01-10 20:19:08 Even with all the drugs, writing was Hunter S. Thompson's favourite high. The same goes for me with #crypto and $BTC.
3006 2018-01-10 20:19:08 Hoping, we don't have another $BCC $BTC overthrow attempt. we all know how badly this ends up for all crypto LOL
3007 2018-01-10 20:19:05 I am HOLDing all of these bags.  Hoping for .  Cheers to crypto!
3008 2018-01-10 20:19:05 If by volume you mean the supply I.e. the number of coins out there then it’s simple. If there’s a huge number of coins for that crypto, it’s harder for the price to rise as a coin is essentially a percentage of that whole crypto. If there’s only 100 coins, wash coin is 1%
3009 2018-01-10 20:18:55 Then get a wallet? Its not rocket science...

3014 2018-01-10 20:18:26 Let the stock market have its fun with 'crypto'. They are already in a record market. Let the pump continue so the crash will be that much more epic.

They are long overdue for a true reality check.
3015 2018-01-10 20:18:24 Those of you panic selling your crypto will regret it pretty soon. Market crashes like these happen and is completely normal. What goes down, must come up... even stronger #trx #xrp #xvg #tron #ripple

3019 2018-01-10 20:18:07 If I could give you any piece advice -

- DO NOT get scared when market changes (no FEAR)

- Every trade you make have an entry, exit and contingency (be CERTAIN)

- Be confident with every trade you make (no DOUBT)

Pretty much is the opposite of #FUD.

3079 2018-01-10 20:14:18 Joe, just got into crypto after months of a friend telling me to (could have bought around 150k TRX coins then). Was able to buy around $300 of TRX last night. Any coins you see taking off or possibly a good sub penny investment?
3080 2018-01-10 20:14:18 @officialmcafee have $3-$5M annual revenue home health company for sale in Texas; want payment in crypto currency
3081 2018-01-10 20:14:16 Que Wall Street quiere meter demasiado las manos para intentar dominar el mercado crypto.
3082 2018-01-10 20:14:14 I've had that argument - I've gotten to the point where I tell her now "if you have to buy me something, get me a box of chocolates". That doesn't impressed her 
3083 2018-01-10 20:14:06 Sorry! It’s probably because work has blocked just about every other site related to crypto for me. Cannot even open coins websites. Work like getting tough
3084 2018-01-10 20:14:03 I’ll pay you my entire gains in crypto to never @ me again
3085 2018-01-10 20:13:59 Been a shitty crypto week I'm just sitting In ETHER trading trying to curve losses
3086 2018-01-10 20:13:58 Want to play big bank takes little bank? 
3087 2018-01-10 20:13:51 good choice :)
3088 2018-01-10 20:13:51 なんていうんですかね、人面犬というかなんというか。笑
3089 2018-01-10 20:13:45 I'm just glad y'all used a pic of crypto daily with a beard. Enjoyed the colab. Would love to see more. I'd even chip in for a better mic for crypto daily.

Plus i got a question for you...i'm very surprised that the perfomance is so low regarding the las quarter bull run on crypto...Could please explain in detail the perf please?
best regards

3103 2018-01-10 20:12:34 What do u think about inspecting 3 banks in South Korea and also S. Korea make a call to 23 other countries in IMF and EU?does it affect crypto market? #XRP #cryptocurrency
3104 2018-01-10 20:12:33 Of course can’t win them all but I’ve had a fantastic 12mths 
3105 2018-01-10 20:12:30 All good & well but Bitcoin never needed anyone but the user's approval. They (GS) are very late to the party. Crypto doesnt need them to start or end its self. It is as real & fake as any money.
3106 2018-01-10 20:12:24 Not saying the market reaction to blockchain and crypto-currency is bubble or dotcom fad, but my poodle just put out a P.R. about his own blockchain platform (chenchaine) and he got $600 million in VC funding in 4 hours.  I saw his business plan.  Complete shite.

3142 2018-01-10 20:09:52 The only way this happens is if another Crypto with better tech comes in and takes its place as the Primary Exchange trading Pair. Bitcoin as a currency has massive disadvantages due to send delays and mining costs that competitors have solved. Either way, you will be wrong.
3143 2018-01-10 20:09:51 In the near future we will see Crypto-ETFs popping up.

Those buying and selling these will be completely missing the point of crypto.

Though that's not to say that they won't profit from it.
3144 2018-01-10 20:09:49 After many horrible experiences on @etherdelta, I've started messing around with @RadarRelay, a new $crypto exchange that leverages $ZRX protocol to trade ETH tokens direct from your wallet.

3162 2018-01-10 20:08:34 He say crypto. Not Bitcoin? Huge distinction?

3172 2018-01-10 20:07:33 Scary, just reading about how a man's whole life savings, all in crypto, was stolen. Cryptocurrency is subject to minimal regulatory oversight, susceptible to cybersecurity breaches and hacks, and there is no recourse should the cryptocurrency disappear.
3173 2018-01-10 20:07:28 I really can't find any peace and harmony in the #cryptocurrency community anymore. People fighting because of #bitcoin or #bitcoincash, #ponzi #Altcoins #shill here and there, #crypto #hacking or #fraud here and there, #FUD everywhere. It's like #decentralized = #disorganized.
3174 2018-01-10 20:07:26 I'm hyping for it
3175 2018-01-10 20:07:18 Next lessons to learn in $crypto:
- spotting the difference between buying the bottom vs catching falling knives.
- spotting the difference between selling a bounce vs selling too quick during an alt rally.

Crypto lessons are expensive!

3180 2018-01-10 20:06:41 haha get to the real world - it's much more difficult to assemble it than to trade in crypto. fkg morons, they make simple things difficult - like this instruction and construction...
3181 2018-01-10 20:06:37 .@thebeetoken’s protocol aims to eliminate the middleman in the home-sharing market. It'd be a solution that can save both hosts and guests large amounts of money, and is badly needed amid record housing and rental prices. #BeeToken #ICO #Crypto

3183 2018-01-10 20:06:29 Im hating anyone who creates this dishonest bullshit culture in crypto. Trying to give meaning to a coin which has not meaning besides making money if lucky. Most of the coins are down. And I lost in other.

3189 2018-01-10 20:06:20 Tip: If you have a bad portfolio ‘day’ switch your gains setting from ‘Last 24hrs’ to ‘All Time’. If the answer is green be happy thankful and learn from mistakes, if it’s red then your probably not in crypto  @get_delta $btc $html $grs $vtc $roflcoin
3190 2018-01-10 20:06:19 Rule #1 in #Crypto - "One of the things we all have to remember is the value of a token over the long term is really going to be driven by its utility," from #Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse

3192 2018-01-10 20:06:06 Honestly, I wish I was on twitter more often when I fist started trading #Crypto. Biggest mistake was not learning the methods some of these guys have been using for years, that they just talk about freely. $BTC $LTC $ETH $ADA $TRX $STRAT $VEN $NEO $DOGE $WAVES
3193 2018-01-10 20:05:57 Getting ready :) 1000 retweets is a lot but im sure u will accomplish that soon enough!
3194 2018-01-10 20:05:51 $BTC as no real life utility. As soon as the exchanges will make the flip to more utility based coin, platforms like $ETH and others $BTC will slowly continue do die. Things go fast in crypto Iwouldn't be surprise to see $BTC below 500$ way before 2020... #flippening
3195 2018-01-10 20:05:51 I think people are trying to base btcp price off of zcl sadly

3212 2018-01-10 20:04:08 - A slow & steady upward growth will suffice, people are making huge losses here, which can reslut in being banned by the govt 

- Pump & Dump should stop( All Crypto ). A lot of noobs in the game, i am a crypto-noob as well but i got in early at 200 sats. 

Just Saying !
3213 2018-01-10 20:04:03 Media pushes the "Crypto will have a bad end" narrative from the Buffett piece, but ignores the fact that he said, "Why in the world would I take a long or short position in something I know nothing about."
3214 2018-01-10 20:04:01 Any ICOs you are looking at at the moment? Have been DMOR extensively, and the only one I wanted to get into was GEMS, but just missed the cutoff. Wanting to park some ETH in a worthwhile project today.
3215 2018-01-10 20:03:52 KB3 just means 1000 B3 coins, if you bought 1 KB3 coin it is EXACTLY the same as 1000 B3 coins, it is a visual representation, the same way each MIOTA is actually representative of 1 Million Iota tokens. Its the same thing, do some research, youre an idiot. take a seat xoxox
3216 2018-01-10 20:03:40 Thanks to this awesome crypto community on Twitter a new big potential coin has come to my attention. Wanchain. Can't wait for it to come to exchanges! $WAN

3223 2018-01-10 20:02:50 i've been reporting advertisements featuring "blockchain experts" offering classes on "getting rich with crypto" while posing in front of lamborghinis as 'misleading / scam.' let's make this a priority in 2018. 
3224 2018-01-10 20:02:39 Travis Weaver @TravWeav   DATE:  7 Dec 2017 Bought 1,500 bitcoin in 2011 for $2.87 each. I will pick 5 random people who retweet this and give one to each of you. Merry Christmas.  #Bitcoin 
DID @TravWeav KEEP HIS WORD       
3225 2018-01-10 20:02:38 If you lost money by coinmarketcap by deliberately removing the volumes from your page of the Korean exchanges..Like and retweet , do the same with them and no longer enter your webpage, to show them who is in the crypto trend, write #fuckcoinmarketcap let's do it together viral
3226 2018-01-10 20:02:25 Which coin mate?
3227 2018-01-10 20:02:17 I’m sorry but where the fuck are you getting that information from!!?  It’s pretty comical!

3229 2018-01-10 20:02:07 To be fair who does know about crypto or where it will go . It might go to the sky it might go to the floor but some part of it will evolve
3230 2018-01-10 20:02:04 The rocket will be taking off for several coins.  My money is waiting to lock and load like early December.
3231 2018-01-10 20:02:01 The last time someone tried to introduce a currency that would mess with USD being the base currency. The person was shot in the head in the middle of a civil war created to dissmantle it. (Gadaffi) #crypto #bitcoin

3236 2018-01-10 20:01:12 I joke about paying crypto taxes, but it’s just that: a joke. Get a good accountant and take care of your shit. No point in getting rich and going to jail
3237 2018-01-10 20:01:09 @JWarrenMD my coworker just gave me a private lesson on crypto and which coins are best for short, mid, and long term. I'm excited to invest again.

3260 2018-01-10 19:59:34 Seems like RSI levels for alts is gaining dominance, which is good. We might be seeing another bull run with these alts and Bitcoin. Although, alts will uptrend faster
3261 2018-01-10 19:59:30 They should never have invited those Crypto kids
3262 2018-01-10 19:59:28 @Dan_Jeffries1 can I ask for a bit of advice.  Does this sound about right for a healthy crypto port?

3265 2018-01-10 19:58:56 Putting money into crypto is gutsy in the first place. If there's anything you can guarantee it's to hold long and to invest in something that is tied to some sort of product or service. Which is exactly what I'm recommending here.
3266 2018-01-10 19:58:53 Dude youre talking nonsense, #B3 is its own coin. Do some research, ive seen you say the same thing on other tweets but you provide no reference or evidence. You must be confused or lying/making up FUD. 
Maybe one of the team from @B3Coins can help you; i think youre confused lol

3292 2018-01-10 19:56:46 The essence of crypto, as you put it, is not exclusion.  Satoshi knew it would one day, by necessity, include use case of banks.  Stellar and Ripple are playing an important role that benefits bitcoin and entire community.  All 3 will shine this year.

3297 2018-01-10 19:56:29 Don't get greedy! Your portfolio shouldn't be more than 20 percent allocated to cryptos other than $btc, $bch, $ltc and $eth (and perhaps a few others). Newer crypto assets have to go through their pump-and-dump stage before becoming a portfolio staple. #cryptoinvesting
3298 2018-01-10 19:56:26 One thing to keep an eye on when trading #crypto is the BTC to coin price, ignore the USD to coin. EG I spent .XX BTC on XXX and although I have "lost"  about 20% in $$,  I am actually even in BTC #cryptocurrency

3363 2018-01-10 19:50:40 Now I see why you are soo good at crypto....You can look in two different directions at the same time. #crosseyedfreak @p123qwqw

3389 2018-01-10 19:48:41 @Paul20573229  Hey Welcome to the #crypto world!!!  Let's make those GAINZ bro.  $BTC is what I eat and $DOGE is what I shit.
3390 2018-01-10 19:48:41 If you had to start over in #crypto tomorrow morning with $1000, what would your strategy be?
3391 2018-01-10 19:48:25 It never made sense to me that coinbase would add ripple before ethereum classic. $ETC is setting up for a big run and I think has the best chance to be the next coin added. #Crypto
3392 2018-01-10 19:48:22 That would I’d be great! However I don’t mind these flat times one bit. It lets me gobble up more trx at a good price.

3399 2018-01-10 19:47:59 Bch is acting like centralized or  one party ruling by forgetting that crypto currency is depended on the community adoption at the end.

3460 2018-01-10 19:43:47 Buying crypto currencies  like tulips is a bad idea, buying into businesses with Block chain technology “could” be a good idea, understanding how your investment in anything generates cash flow is a Great idea.  #JPMorgan #cnbc

3467 2018-01-10 19:43:27 Friend there is no offense intended. It is merely a reference to the price of a coin
3468 2018-01-10 19:43:22 This thread began as a discussion of the social problems in the crypto world, and how these issues are holding back adoption.

Your insistence upon discussing the technology instead only bolsters my point.
3469 2018-01-10 19:43:19 If that is in place but you can interchange any coin pairs... Why not consolidate to a few core currencies instead of the complexity and cost of interchange. Crypto shouldn't be trying to emulate the current economy, it should be trying to fix it's shortcomings

3480 2018-01-10 19:42:27 I’ve always thought the use of the word “contracts” in crypto, esp Ethereum, was just marketing bollocks.
3481 2018-01-10 19:42:23 The issuance of Tokens/Crypto Coins is the first genuine revolution in Trade/Finance for over a century.

3499 2018-01-10 19:41:50 fuck bro.....looks like youre getting the Assange treatment. I recommend looking into cryptocurrencies as a means of sending and receiving $$. Its decentralized. Nobody can shut that shit down. happy to offer you any info i have on the crypto space
3500 2018-01-10 19:41:49 This will be the obvious move if you want to give your users the best possible experience? Why? Because moving from BTC to say BCH, ETH, or LTC is not very user friendly and people do this to avoid fees of BTC.BCH market think on it.

3507 2018-01-10 19:41:20 I’m looking to change USD into crypto and want something cheaper and better than Coinbase.  What are y’all using? (I have binance but they don’t deal in fiat)
3508 2018-01-10 19:41:17 As you are a day trader tou must feel so bad right now. Take your loss already so we can HODL in peace

3516 2018-01-10 19:40:45 100$ or 1000$,Can it bloody get back to it previous price so I can get rid of the damn thing? You can be a millionaire when you are 90yrs old,I want to live a millionaire.
3517 2018-01-10 19:40:32 You mean I missed the titanic I’m glad I did LOL
3518 2018-01-10 19:40:31 "smart contracts + crypto makes this super doable" - ahem, why do you need those things? Can't you think of less ridiculous ways to publish a hash for later verification???
3519 2018-01-10 19:40:25 attack 1 box is the worst kind of crypto snake oil actually worked.
3520 2018-01-10 19:40:25 It looks like a scam imo so I wouldn't worry about it. If you are looking for Masternode coins then I would take a look at $PHR. Masternodes, privacy, pos, small market cap, small circulating supply, and it's not on many exchanges right now. #ThankMeLater
3521 2018-01-10 19:40:10 lol #Kodak is a shell of a company.  they couldnt pivot to digital, went the age of the dinosaur, sold off any decent ip by 2012, and is now nothing more than a name to be licensed off to the highest bidder.  this is cash grab of the lowest lvl.

3535 2018-01-10 19:38:39 @acaseofcrypto follow please
3536 2018-01-10 19:38:27 The crypto market is correcting. It's not a crash, take some time away from looking at the charts. Don't sell. Ride it out and we will see green again very soon. New all time highs in Q1 2018. Patience is necessary here, weak hands lose out. #Blockchain #crypto #bitcoin
3537 2018-01-10 19:38:26 The good thing about #crypto is that in a month you'll see like 3 altseasons come and go and witness first hand how true that is. Surviving those first 2/3 is the key!
3538 2018-01-10 19:38:25 A breath of fresh air and such a pleasure to use a #crypto #exchange that functions like its intended to @binance_2017
3539 2018-01-10 19:38:22 Yeah I bought kin in mercatox and everything worked. But in the chat and online I see a lot of people being scammed in mercatox. And people that say they are scammed in the chat get chat privileges taken away. I just read that ripple is telling people not to trade with mercatox.
3540 2018-01-10 19:38:20 Macron coin a fait *170, donc x10 pas vraiment une référence, surtout pour un début après une ICO ^^

3544 2018-01-10 19:38:10 Yup, they'll chide you for saying that more white people are shot by police than blacks ("population proportion!"), but they don't dare touch actual crime statistics with a 20 foot pole. It just reeks of dishonesty when they try to play the "per capita" game like this.
3545 2018-01-10 19:38:08 Beats crying about it on Twitter all day long calling everything a scam and spoof.

3686 2018-01-10 19:26:24 I hate ripple too. Too centralized. I think it's riding to coattails of truly decentralized crypto.

3689 2018-01-10 19:26:08 Coinomi, easy to use. It also supports a ton of other coins as well.
3690 2018-01-10 19:25:50 No credible business accepts crypto currency yet but fast forward 20-30 years and it might be different.
3691 2018-01-10 19:25:45 @NikonCanada and @CanonUSA consider launching their own crypto currencies but worry that it will impact the value of the #KodakCoin they already bought and that their nephew says is definitely going to go way up.
3692 2018-01-10 19:25:39 What, you don't want more infighting and attempted takeovers/forks?

It's like you don't even crypto my man

3697 2018-01-10 19:25:05 I think it may actually end up that BTC/crypto is what computers/devices/etc ... use to "pay" for things more so than people. A true "digital" economy. So, devices will "need" crypto to transact (Robot Strippers gotta eat!) -- but that's another rabbit hole for another day... 6/6
3698 2018-01-10 19:24:54 Awesome!
3699 2018-01-10 19:24:53 Every company is coming out with their own crypto currency now, they’ve become gift cards

3701 2018-01-10 19:24:46 It better pump to shit when it comes live! I have 80 $ardr just sitting there 
3702 2018-01-10 19:24:38 Talking about wars : you're at war with every crypto that isn't BCH. BTC in the first place. You're almost as good at it as Nikki Haley. Let crypto's develop in peace, leave your own interest out of it for a change.
3703 2018-01-10 19:24:36 $Sys is the future.
3704 2018-01-10 19:24:36 I would buy puts on every crypto if I could as well. 90% are shit - it's easy money. The other 10% expire worthless, so what.

3714 2018-01-10 19:23:21 The best current use for block chain crypto currency is for gambling online in states that don't permit it and buying weed online.
3715 2018-01-10 19:23:18 I find that while it looks nicer it is often slightly off. I use both Blockfolio and Delta. (delta when sharing and talking about crypto, blockfolio for my self since it seems a bit more accurate.)

3722 2018-01-10 19:21:58 Is @Bitcoin a fraud? Not at all.

Is #bitcoin value a fraud? Could be.

Will it survive? Nope. Because once the insiders and the government folks across the world make their money, they will clamp down hard on it and make it useless. @CNBC 

Same with any other crypto-currency.

3729 2018-01-10 19:21:25 Buffett has a free pass for life (and after) not give a crypto cent care what others think.
Problem with puts- premium for 1yr out puts has to be $$$. I don't follow but assume it'd be rather pricey to play in options as well. limited downside but still hefty premium to pay

3756 2018-01-10 19:19:40 Crypto Currencies, like #bitcoin #Ethereum, are democratizing financial instruments and opening up leveling the playing field for citizens of the world.

3759 2018-01-10 19:19:26 Crypto is basically low cap equities on steroids. Totally irrelevant news that seems very positive will often pump things to the moon
3760 2018-01-10 19:19:15 #Life : Everyone in this world is haunted by how long one has to hold on and when to let it go. Its worst when u don't wanna give up on someone but somewhere deep inside you know you have to. Applies to #Crypto too #HODL #Dump. And life goes on . . .
3761 2018-01-10 19:19:04 I'n not sure they are going to stop the manufacturing of mining equipment, just the process of actually mining crypto, or as I have just learnt the illegal mining.  I need to do more research though.

3774 2018-01-10 19:18:11 Which if true presents an interesting fact: He is already known as a liar by the crypto community (and by extension BCH's reputation suffers), so maybe in the end legal enforcement is not needed at all. Instead ostracism might act as the regulator in such decentralized systems.

3776 2018-01-10 19:18:10 Head and shoulders is bearish for sure but if the neckline holds and it starts to close and rise above, like it has, that invalidates the pattern. But I am open to being corrected, im still learning.

fundamentals matter in the long run, but a dude on Twitter with a shit ton of followers shilling a coin has more affect on the price than the tech behind it.

3791 2018-01-10 19:17:03 New #cryptocurrency “ConziCoin” looks interesting: limited supply, the more people buy in, the higher the price (so new investors subsidise existing investor profit). What do you think? #crypto

3796 2018-01-10 19:16:52 It's funny people make a solid opinion about crypto but don't even understand it. DYOR
3797 2018-01-10 19:16:51 if i would have held my first crypto investments from a year ago I would have over 30 grand investing 300 dollars, but i did not. how's your day going?
3798 2018-01-10 19:16:38 Regardless of what you believe about the rush for crypto currencies, I’ve had a 100% increase in the number people asking me about how to securely store secrets/private keys in the last year...
3799 2018-01-10 19:16:37 If I didn't have full bags I would probably be buying the dip these days. Strong coins are going to perform well long term, shitcoins can crash and die anytime. Believe in your picks. #BTFD #HODL
3800 2018-01-10 19:16:33 More of an update of the continual concerns of what people may decide to use privacy coins for. $XMR just happens to be the coin in the headline - $XVG has seen it's share of bad press. I didn't speak negatively about #Monero.
3801 2018-01-10 19:16:30 You should know this information tomorrow will announce the price of KIN will increase how much satoshi
3802 2018-01-10 19:16:27 I was thinking that it fell after Justin's livestream. He did more than make up with some really BIG announcements. Surprised the market is reacting negatively to these announcements
3803 2018-01-10 19:16:19 Warren Buffet said he would never invest in crypto so I think a filter is needed everywhere 
3804 2018-01-10 19:16:17 @Crypto_Wise12 thanks for being an inspiration. I have a lot of studying to do :) What are your top  5 coins this year?
3805 2018-01-10 19:15:51 Aha I find GIF gems like you find crypto ones ^^
3806 2018-01-10 19:15:48 Watching every freak out over crypto currency’s dropping in value... well no shit it’s dropping everyone got hyped bought and is now selling cause they made a small profit. It’s expecting, if you are afraid to lose money crypto isn’t for you @Ripple will rise again!
3807 2018-01-10 19:15:42 Any thoughts @ProfFaustus ?
3808 2018-01-10 19:15:26 Happy that I'm back into the crypto game. 2018 shall be an interesting year

3810 2018-01-10 19:15:20 As a crypto newb, I really appreciate the explanation! It makes me wonder: this sets a precedent for crypto "copyright" infringement. Since there is no owned brand for BTC (correct me if I'm wrong), no one can enforce Roger to not market BCH as if it were BTC, right?

3837 2018-01-10 19:13:26 The bugs in implementing crypto aren’t necessarily in the crypto libraries (though don’t take them for granted!), but are often how you tie those libraries into the fabric of your application.  The logic involved ain’t easy.
3838 2018-01-10 19:13:25 so you always cash out profits? If not how much of profits are distributed in fashion you mention?

3872 2018-01-10 19:10:57 I am a crypto donkey. Is it true that is a problem to cash out bitcoins? A friend´s friend (true) has bitcoins worth about 600.000 $ and said he is unable to get that amount of cash. Any news on this subject anywhere?
3873 2018-01-10 19:10:42 3 months $1
3874 2018-01-10 19:10:34 Yeah auditable systems are another possible use of this particular kind of crypto but again, trust is always cheaper.
3875 2018-01-10 19:10:28 The same way he was quick to get out at a profit, he could get out quickly at a small loss. Just gotta define well ur risk and timeframe.

3889 2018-01-10 19:09:45 Thank you, thank you and thank you Mr. Warren Buffett. Crypto currency is an illegal loophole and an hybrid monster at the crossroad of morales values. It's quasi demonic!
3890 2018-01-10 19:09:43 Sounds good to me.
3891 2018-01-10 19:09:41 Is this also a semi troll bc crypto?
3892 2018-01-10 19:09:38 With all this crypto currency hype, i think im going to start my own, call it "byte coin", and capitalize on all the "experts" that will insist that 8 bitcoin = 1 bytecoin
3893 2018-01-10 19:09:25 Since you are obviously a noob in this area, some advice - never love a coin more than it loves you.
3894 2018-01-10 19:09:22 I could have sold $XEL and $PTOY in a winning position, but I was stupid, made a mistake, and didn't want to accept my mistake until it was way too late. My fault completely

3897 2018-01-10 19:09:12 It's not gambling really, especially if he defined a stop loss. He saw the coin picking up in volume/price, he traded the breakout and he got rid quickly at some profit.

3905 2018-01-10 19:08:39 Not related to your post, but want to say you're the crypto man as ETH hit $1387 on Coinbase today! It is a little early than Feb. Hard to remember when you made that call, but I know it was way way out. Anyone in the space and not following your work and reports is missing out.
3906 2018-01-10 19:08:38 warren buffet is the last person in the world who's opinion i care about when it comes to crypto. just saying.
3907 2018-01-10 19:08:31 Is it your position that Blockstream does not intend to profit from off chain txs?  And that high fees push people off chain?
3908 2018-01-10 19:08:21 i'm crypto-curious and love many mags and would still have a hard time buying in. really gonna take the right readership to make that first leap.
3909 2018-01-10 19:08:14 Just wanted to remind you that most of the ppl talking shit on Twitter are rooting for other coins to succeed and are not even LTC holders. I hope the mass amount of dunces joining crypto does affect you too much. I have left lots of crypto groups because of it. We love you!
3910 2018-01-10 19:08:08 Smart man Mr. Gokhstein...Crypto enthusiasts life myself appreciate your wisdom and truth @davidgohkstein
3911 2018-01-10 19:08:07 Definitely, and it's a fair point. My issue was more people treating Buffett like some kind of buffoon for not immediately buying in to the crypto train.

Any pushback is met with a condescending "you just don't understand" rather than any willingness to discuss potential downsides.

3944 2018-01-10 19:05:11 Am I evil for wanting bitcoin and crypto to crash so all my friends who "invested" within the last couple of months who are professional bitcoin traders now, lose all their money? Nothing would make me happier in the world actually...

3946 2018-01-10 19:05:03 Our main focus is the major update we are working on. EPC has hard working people behind the scene trying to create something that will set us apart from majority of other crypto currencies. However, we will try to be more active once we release our updates.
3947 2018-01-10 19:04:58 respect!
3948 2018-01-10 19:04:53 Exchanges will help. Mostly it’ll have to duck a bitcoin run that’ll cause all alts like xby, xvg, xrb, xrp that went on huge runs to retrace sharply.
3949 2018-01-10 19:04:51 Stop telling crypto is crashing because you see this week's charts. Look at the five year trend and then get back to me.

3952 2018-01-10 19:04:36 Yes, make it an "annual" thing.  I'm even an insider but still think it is a good idea.  It's nice for the small budget crypto guys to get a leg up sometimes.  Hopefully, they do well and also become insiders.

3985 2018-01-10 19:02:29 JB and Grim clearly sensible, know what they’re talking about. Any of the #Goons that have made gains (I.e definitely anyone that bought a #ShitCoin pre-thanksgiving) needs to be aware that FY17/18 could be HMRCs first opportunity for govt to cash in on crypto.
3986 2018-01-10 19:02:28 LTC is a better transactions mechanism than BTC. However, all crypto is nothing but new accounting software. It's effective as a Western Union substitute. No value in these coins. Just worthless digits on a screen being passed back n forth.
3987 2018-01-10 19:02:24 love Warren Buffet. but ive never met anyone over the age of 40 that fundamentally understands anything in crypto.

Not in crypto though, it helps. Sell when people tell you to buy, and buy when people tell you to sell. Be a rich contrarian.

4000 2018-01-10 19:01:41 Hi @Socal, quick question - How do you think the China ban on mining will effect the btc difficulty ?  Will it adjust down, since there will be less hashpower ?  I'm researching mining, and it's a little confusing.  Thanks dude.  I'm in Norcal - love your twitter.
4001 2018-01-10 19:01:40 That's great- you were the guy who had a million XBY if recall correctly? When do you think it will pass 1 dollar and then 10- It really needs to get on other exchanges. With the volume increase it will happen quickly. The third testnet is underway for another 2 weeks..

4020 2018-01-10 19:00:54 At a fundamental level, the blockchain is simply a database. That's it. The faster we realize that, the faster we will understand which projects will survive in the end. If the overall success of the project relies on something outside of a secure database, stay away. #crypto

4030 2018-01-10 19:00:17 My personal strategy is to zoom out look at ATH, ATL, where we are in the market cycle, etc etc to guage upside potential and then i set a realistic profit I'm happy with. Stock market does "very good" with +20% so that's my normal minimum profit zone

4075 2018-01-10 18:57:59 Why do crypto currency when you can get STANLEY NICKELS
4076 2018-01-10 18:57:56 True. But it does not have same backing. BCH is backed by crypto giants

$xrb is even better than $DGB ...
4077 2018-01-10 18:57:48 Why can you not make a real BTC fork of it and include all balances from the real BTC blockchain. Great promotion. (but implement replay protection)
4078 2018-01-10 18:57:45 What we are wanting is adoption, which will make crypto the money (that makes the world go round) used. Adoption is key, @SatoshiLite is doing a hell of a job
4079 2018-01-10 18:57:44 U seem like a smart dude... Why don't you stop shillings these scam coins and try promoting some real crypto projects that actually have a future. Stop bitching about the genesis block stuff... That's what a fork means... U guys literally copied the code that the Core devs built!

4083 2018-01-10 18:57:20 Crypto IS long term wealth.  Everything being equal, nothing is better than crypto imo.  Everything physical can be taken from you (loss, theft, disaster) so what makes any of those better than crypto (other than volatility)?
4084 2018-01-10 18:57:18 Is it a buy again now it is low, just a question for educational  purpose?
4085 2018-01-10 18:57:13 Very interesting, thanks for sharing! Just amazing, there are (already) 150 crypto coins/currencies.
4086 2018-01-10 18:57:11 I think you missed $XLM
4087 2018-01-10 18:56:57 That I don’t know. I don’t use MEW. Maybe someone that knows can reply to this..
4088 2018-01-10 18:56:54 Sadly it doesn't mean 27 million people will be using the exchange
4089 2018-01-10 18:56:51 Are you considering total supply of coins in that? How are you exactly calculating that?

4093 2018-01-10 18:56:46 #6 is my favorite and something I find many Crypto Twitter Accounts do not market. All they talk about is speculative news and buy/sell based off that. They make for bad leaders in such a new industry
4094 2018-01-10 18:56:46 The year is 2021 and while the class action lawsuits continue to search for someone to blame for millions of people losing their entire savings account of dozens of dollars on failed crypto, ESPN will run a where are they now on former OWL players and ask what blizzard did wrong
4095 2018-01-10 18:56:43 Getting items approved in the Apple app store crypto related is hard.  @DigiByteCoin was approved for 'TESTING' their new wallet.  Which is why $DGB just skyrocketed the past 45 minutes.
4096 2018-01-10 18:56:34 Crypto or forex?
4097 2018-01-10 18:56:31 Follow me and ask any question u want to know about willing to help just keep safe each other if u have better solutions u think let me know i am looking forward to hear from you i am open so i believe i can learn from everyone it matters :)
4098 2018-01-10 18:56:28 $plr in the year that i have paid attention to crypto i dont think I've seen a group as solid as @pillarwallet.

4104 2018-01-10 18:56:11 Good year so far. Have 10% going into my tsp. Started mining bitcoin and going to invest those earnings into other crypto currencies. My work at the gym is paying off. Ranking up in two weeks. Things are good
4105 2018-01-10 18:56:08 Brad, what are your thoughts on the professionalism of the team around this ICO (no white paper, not able to share submitted NEO address for the ICO). Just thinking of passing on this ICO..
4106 2018-01-10 18:56:07 Think you mean being killed

4109 2018-01-10 18:56:01 So Kodak have announced that they are entering the crypto space. Hmmm.

4117 2018-01-10 18:55:39 You really deserve that position! Great inspiration to the crypto community @SimonYuSEA @Storm_Token

4119 2018-01-10 18:55:31 @6BillionPeople do you know “Strong Hands”? it’s strange and interesting crypto currency;)
4120 2018-01-10 18:55:30 Hopefully it hurry’s up as I need to get some out to buy back into the $EOS train as it’s left me behind!
4121 2018-01-10 18:55:27 Everyday, someone new buys a crypto currency for the first time

Value based investing and involvement is a golden rule

4122 2018-01-10 18:55:23 Dude. Like seriously... How much do you get to act all obnoxious on social media. Everyone who actually follows the crypto space knows BCash is a scam. It's capable of low fees because no one uses it... Just compare the daily transaction volume of bitcoin and shitcoin Cash
4123 2018-01-10 18:55:23 You know that's @loomdart's gig, I'm the CEO of Kucoin 
4124 2018-01-10 18:55:22 Don’t listen to him @SDolling. He doesn’t know fuck all about the pound nevermind crypto. @IeuanBecks
4125 2018-01-10 18:55:22 Don't take crypto advice from Warren Buffett. He only recently decided tech stocks weren’t too complex to invest in. Of course Warren, that Amazon website is never going to work....
4126 2018-01-10 18:55:15 BAT
4127 2018-01-10 18:55:15 hahaha, what a great comparison side by side like that. The Crypto market don't care!

4132 2018-01-10 18:55:06 I'm a huge fan of @itswarrenbuffet and still am. I've gained much from his words so I don't take his opinion lightly. That said, bitcoin/crypto solve many problems fiat cannot. It's good to be vigilant and no, there isn't room for ALL these coins but the tech is here to stay.

4135 2018-01-10 18:54:50 I want to ask how are you going to do marketing and stuff? Everyone in Indian crypto space should be talking about laxmi but they are not. Even internationally, India is big market for investors.
4136 2018-01-10 18:54:49 Hashgraph is permissioned (no indication it ssuitable for cencorship free one) network. Crypto world won t accept private "crypto" if such comes out.
4137 2018-01-10 18:54:48 Craig/Fake Satoshi you're an embarrassment to aussies everywhere not to mention academics. The people of Australia cringe when they hear your name, you have zero credibility outside the bcash syndicate. Particularly on the streets of Melbourne. Don't talk to me.
4138 2018-01-10 18:54:35 So how do you inform your decisions on  your trades?

4141 2018-01-10 18:54:30 Lol you idiot when you tweeted trx price was $0.13 and one hour later it went to $0.9 check charts

4150 2018-01-10 18:54:07 Lol Nexus btc clone. Decentealised internet, 3d blockchain, qauntum resistent and much more. Wont call it a clone.
4151 2018-01-10 18:54:06 Revoluts Geschäftsmodell lebt im wesentlichen davon, dass Migranten Geld nach Hause schicken. Kann ich ehrlich gesagt verstehen in dem Fall.

4160 2018-01-10 18:53:34 Kodak has a coin. It's the wild west of any yahoo getting into the crypto game, dangerous times
4161 2018-01-10 18:53:30 Any update on Strat
4162 2018-01-10 18:53:23 Yea it’s pretty cool. Makes sense however as they needed to do something to save themselves haha. Other companies are too conservative to jump into the crypto space. Very unproven.
4163 2018-01-10 18:53:02 I think that gas price and gas limit concepts should perhaps be more hidden from end users.
4164 2018-01-10 18:53:00 I got little more frisky with 2 of these while dipped
4165 2018-01-10 18:52:53 The rise looks nice and sustained... got my 
4166 2018-01-10 18:52:48 It’s because Crypto trading allows the people at the bars to invest and be rewarded significantly (hopefully).  Need to be a person at a country club for Uber or Lyft to really change lives.
4167 2018-01-10 18:52:46 in that case spread them different account and paper wallet or some thing secure
4168 2018-01-10 18:52:38 And just a cool dude 
4169 2018-01-10 18:52:30 $btc $xrp $ada $sc vb. Birsuru milletin hikmetinden sual etmedigi projenin bes para etmez oldugunu soyledim. Bunlarin hepsinin gerekçeleri var.  Ben hiçbirzaman boş konuşmam. Bi Skype röportajı falan yapalim anlatayim. Sonuçta bunları anlatmak için buradayız.
4170 2018-01-10 18:52:26 Only invest what you can afford to lose. Crypto is educated betting at best.
4171 2018-01-10 18:52:23 By the way, have you seen the $lmc lately? They got app in which u can collect their coins so preety much free cash especially that it is still a low cost coin
4172 2018-01-10 18:52:19 All of their 1080ti cards are out of stock except for some priced at $1300. I suppose that is supply and demand at work
4173 2018-01-10 18:52:17 Paid mine today. Nasty business. Next year's is relying on a crypto surge, otherwise it's prison for me.

4179 2018-01-10 18:51:54 if you thinking about trx and other yes
4180 2018-01-10 18:51:54 i like tether's description.
4181 2018-01-10 18:51:47 $ETC is unfortunatly one of the many crypto to get listed. Imo will not affect price. Still #hodl :)

4183 2018-01-10 18:51:43 $ST is on binance trading as $OST.  Simple token. Its 200 mil mcap and allows businesses to create their own crypto. Being added to two huge asian exchanges tomorrow. I got a big bag of this beauty. Long term. Huge use case
4184 2018-01-10 18:51:40 Haven't looked in to $XVG, but it's my impression the same description applies 
4185 2018-01-10 18:51:33 Wow, I trade cryptos...stocks and Forex. I usually don't agree with @AntonKreil but I do on this tweet. Any level headed trader spending time in Crypto price action would agree that this mania will not last...only evolve to what Anton states as fundamental metrics.
4186 2018-01-10 18:51:31 Simply could never divest but now I'm upset I traded mine for other crypto
4187 2018-01-10 18:51:30 mostly all
which one you concerned about?
4188 2018-01-10 18:51:30 Sorry for the serious tweet but when someone tell me they can't pay their bills and they are down $50k on a loan they took out to buy #crypto, something needs to be said about their gambling addiction publically.  $btc

4203 2018-01-10 18:50:21 So I'm new to this whole twitter thing, held 1btc forever(2014), started trading recently, followed this guy cuz I'm from Van Nuys and I like the pic. Who knew his advice would be so sound. Thanks bro
4204 2018-01-10 18:50:12 Not yet, optimistically hoping to see xby added to kucoin or binance.
4205 2018-01-10 18:50:11 Hm?
4206 2018-01-10 18:50:06 Ok that's fine, crypto doesn't prevent credit or default if people want to engage in such activity. Nor does crypto imply that centralised or fiat currencies will cease to exist. I really don't understand why you're implying that to be the case.
4207 2018-01-10 18:50:04 If you are new to crypto I recommend just holding ltc, eth and btc

You will still get amazing growth while you learn the markets, whitepapers and which alts are good. Way less risky then buying random alts or cheap coins

Ltc (especially) /eth/btc will still have great % growth
4208 2018-01-10 18:49:51 It’s hard for these old farts who have been successful in traditional ways, to accept changing new tech that will take over in the future! Crypto is just getting started.
4209 2018-01-10 18:49:51 It’s more of a front door they are asking.
4210 2018-01-10 18:49:50 How many needed for masternode?

4213 2018-01-10 18:49:30 Thought about getting the nano ledger but u can't store all coins on there huh?
4214 2018-01-10 18:49:10 English version?!
4215 2018-01-10 18:49:10 It would seem then that the market is voting that Litecoin is the fastest, easiest, cheapest and most efficient crypto currency to move between other crypto or transact in then? Otherwise, the volume numbers would not be where they are. @SatoshiLite
4216 2018-01-10 18:49:03 That's like gambling. It could've dumped back to 20k right after he picked it up.
4217 2018-01-10 18:49:01 There has been a lot of shady dealings lately in crypto but I believe in @ArdorPlatform & #ignis. It’s a shame that #BittrexTrouble is screwing this up.
4218 2018-01-10 18:48:59 We are no looking for a backdoor really but for a front door.
4219 2018-01-10 18:48:58 Troll
4220 2018-01-10 18:48:56 There is a group of hard-drinking men in their mid-50s in Balham Spoons discussing crypto. One's invested £5k. "It's the fucking algorithm, innit?"
4221 2018-01-10 18:48:52 1/3 I can see that with this bulish movement $VEN can go up to 10.5 USD soon. Before the jump a short pull back 0.00037 BTC can be possible and will confirm the bullish run.

4236 2018-01-10 18:48:00 I have faith in you Steve and the tenacity shown with the crypto business, however I would like a bit more clarity on rig deployment status for WA and rollout plans for Scandia.  Thanks
4237 2018-01-10 18:47:57 BIG endorsement from China guys!
4238 2018-01-10 18:47:56 Sorry Mike I disagree. The high ragard you speak of, that in some instances came at the cost blood spilled. Has been diluted into a trading crypto currency for rich seeking validity by use and ownership of the £. The UK is failing, adapt or fail and the UK doesnt want to
4239 2018-01-10 18:47:54 Retweet if you've made some more  from crypto....

4241 2018-01-10 18:47:48 I have made similar list with grading from (1-5); specially bottom 400 crypto of cmc..
4242 2018-01-10 18:47:46 Kinda like OG Bitcoiners agreeing with majority of pleb fiat slaves back in 2013? Yeah, don't use crowd/sheep bullying, it weakens your argument in a contrarian space like crypto.

4255 2018-01-10 18:46:42 Hey man, what are your thoughts on BlockV (VEE)? I've got it on OKEx exchange and am very keen to to get it off that platform if it's listed on Bittrex or Binance etc. - thoughts on this happening also? Cheers
4256 2018-01-10 18:46:40 Change your twitter handle, disgusting methods
4257 2018-01-10 18:46:38 Nothing re: crypto surprises me at this point. Parallels to “.com” in the 90s are almost unavoidable.
4258 2018-01-10 18:46:32 Thanks for what you do. Appreciate all you have taught me ! Putting on for the SOCAL people in crypto 
4259 2018-01-10 18:46:31 I remember the days when the number of followers of your favorite Twitter follow was the whole $crypto Twitter! - LMAO
4260 2018-01-10 18:46:29 Bottom line: if a woman does not agree with the True Doctrine (as revealed by the self-appointed leaders), she must be a crypto-misogynist. Nice point for the Gender Religion!
4261 2018-01-10 18:46:27 @AntonKreil as much as i enjoyed watching you sheepishly deal with 'ufc emille' back in the day, i agree, there will be an armageddon phase for crypto. Only those who have real experience trading, realise that. 
4262 2018-01-10 18:46:20 ①は好材料
②は直近だけ見れば悪材料

好材料悪材料両方出ていて下がれば材料出尽くしのことが多いのです。
4263 2018-01-10 18:46:17 Whole countries, top Fortune 500 companies and the people that control your money all are invested in crypto and want to make their own coin. Yet you idiots still say it’s a bubble. Adapt with the times....crypto is the future
4264 2018-01-10 18:46:17 So crypto money = bad money?
4265 2018-01-10 18:46:15 $NFLX another new ATH at 213. That's 6 consecutive days a new ATH. Unbelievable. Like a crypto coin.
4266 2018-01-10 18:46:13 As long as $VRC doesn't break under 19k this could keep on going slowly imho.
4267 2018-01-10 18:46:07 In 2018 we wagering crypto currency 
4268 2018-01-10 18:46:07 The app is not in English, how will it work?
4269 2018-01-10 18:46:05 @WarrenBuffett will come to a bad ending say crypto currencies. Old man, this new world seems to defy you, because you’re ignorant, aren’t learning about it outside of MSM & have too much to loose in the legacy markets. Thanks for your past work/advice but retire already.
4270 2018-01-10 18:46:02 alright.. ive still a lot to learn but this is what a kind of risky move in my eyes.. deffo nothing for beginners but great to see that there are different kind of tactics on a higher level of trading. wp to the guy!
4271 2018-01-10 18:46:00 And don't force yourself to the short trading. Figure out what trading scheme is best for you. #HODL
4272 2018-01-10 18:45:59 I do day trade as well investing. Nothing wrong with making extra money if you know what you doing and also lots of research news etc good luck
4273 2018-01-10 18:45:54 I had an idea for a crypto-podcast that hasn't been done yet. I'm looking into the logistics of what it takes to get a podcast listed on platforms like Google Play, Apple Music, Spotify, and Stitcher.
4274 2018-01-10 18:45:52 Trying to stay ontop of my psychology and emotions on this rollercoaster ,defo the hardest part
4275 2018-01-10 18:45:51 and I recently found out about the craze world of #crypto and bought like 0.0000001 of #bitcoins. I know I missed this train too. people say it is a balloon, or a bubble. that it will burst and stuff. scaaary.
4276 2018-01-10 18:45:49 Sorry Josh, that’s a little harsh but so is being so flippant on early crypto. You are just setting yourself up to be made fun of in a listicle five years from now like the guys who laughed at Amazon.
4277 2018-01-10 18:45:48 Switch from ETH to BCC #eth #bcc #crypto

Be smart

Had to go from #ripple to #etherum to #bitcoincash 

Just follow the flow of the market until we see more uptrends.

Right now there are SO LITTLE
4278 2018-01-10 18:45:46 Major bear-run in the crypto market, keep holding. I started with x in November, by Jan 1st, it was 3.5x, last week I took out x and since then playing with the rest 2.5x. Always take out the principal.
4279 2018-01-10 18:45:40 What if the crypto currencies are actually trading us 
4280 2018-01-10 18:45:38 Been seeing so many Enterprise #Blockchain projects kicking off within the relatively non-glamorous confines of incumbent companies. Minus the Crypto-currency frenzy currently drowning the newswires, these are hard-calculated forays into one of the most promising technologies.
4281 2018-01-10 18:45:36 in the clear now?
4282 2018-01-10 18:45:31 I think I’m bouta start investing into crypto currency
4283 2018-01-10 18:45:29 definitely my friend in hardware wallet. only tiny bit you can keep in cloud wallet just in case
4284 2018-01-10 18:45:26 The Crypto ecosystem is so exciting that you spend most of your free time learning how to mine, trade, set masternodes and reading white papers. But it seems to me that, until you focus on a single niche, you'll suck at every single one of them.
4285 2018-01-10 18:45:21 Are you really saying that #3 crypto is marketcap is dropping down to zero? Can I help you find a substance abuse center in your area?
4286 2018-01-10 18:45:15 Trying to monitor @telegram and twitter  for crypto info is sometime maddening. It’s cutting into my wild speculation videos on @YouTube
4287 2018-01-10 18:45:09 @Rentberry_  Is the future you were waiting for. Unlock the potential of thousands of dollars of rent deposits. Invest them in Crypto or Stock Exchange. Keep good raiting. Rentberry will fundamentally change the way we deal with landlord tenant relations.
4288 2018-01-10 18:45:05 Are you buying more ripple right now or waiting for further drops? @Crypto_goat_
4289 2018-01-10 18:44:57 2 que todos deben comprender lo que generan cuando compran X o Y #Crypto, si buscan lo fácil y efímero claro que #Cardano, #Bcash, #Ripple y demás les van a dar buen dinero, pero lo importante es que NO pierdan de vista los proyectos que están diseñados/pensados para crear
4290 2018-01-10 18:44:50 i pinched my back but at least my crypto currency is up..
4291 2018-01-10 18:44:49 Not if they bought TRX @.02 & XRP @.15 they're not...
4292 2018-01-10 18:44:47 Would love to get your perspective on how to properly take profits on altcoins, low to mid cap in particular
4293 2018-01-10 18:44:46 teach me. if i can get a small quiet apartment and food with crypto i will go
4294 2018-01-10 18:44:23  wow.  This will go down as one of the best $crypto tweets ever.  Clever :)
4295 2018-01-10 18:44:15 I like QSP but not sure about BBR. i think qsp have more opportunity to grow

4297 2018-01-10 18:44:11 Exactly! George has been the best there is compared to other's insight and knowledge in the crypto world.
4298 2018-01-10 18:44:08 I am in for long term.. Hodl wins in crypto.. This is a $100 coin
4299 2018-01-10 18:44:01 Then why aren’t you buying them?
4300 2018-01-10 18:43:59 Calling all technical analysts/chart gurus: What's #TRON #TRONCOIN going to do? #Crypto
4301 2018-01-10 18:43:48 Firstly, this account is controlled by the people behind BCash... These guys are always salty and trying to discredit BTC. Secondly, its not Bitcoin Core, its just Bitcoin. Everything else, especially BCash, is a cheap knockoff, a scam, a shameful attempt at crypto. BCash sucks.
4302 2018-01-10 18:43:43 Where do I get the MJ crypto wallet?

4304 2018-01-10 18:43:35 Locking up $$ for 12 months in nfl seems to be a novice move for a crypto investor.
4305 2018-01-10 18:43:29 . I'll buy it for 200m in my new crypto currency the 'FakeShit' they'll be worth less than nothing in 5 minutes time

4308 2018-01-10 18:43:16 @CryptosR_Us  I have to say out of all of the other crypto knowledge gurus out there, you're the best.  Thank you for your education and knowledge in the crypto world.  Definitely the best there is!
4309 2018-01-10 18:43:16 Thank s for your analysis, it' s well reasoned. Crypto space needs more rational thoughts and analysis.
4310 2018-01-10 18:43:16 I lost a lot of crypto money and stock money this week. Last week I made a lot though so can’t complain too much. Dragon helped my portfolio not go down so much.
4311 2018-01-10 18:43:13 dude, what happens to the coins we have on ED atm?
4312 2018-01-10 18:43:10 Hey all, just wanted to say I try to be responsive to everyone and answer questions, HOWEVER I will not give you price targets, or give on demand analysis. I try to do as much research on a coin as I possibly can before tweeting about it.

That said, I am happy to help you learn

4314 2018-01-10 18:43:07 Whales purposely dumping & manipulating the market because they knew the newbs would panic sell. People are finally catching on though and not falling for it now so buy more & HODL. Tron is emerging from this FUD rut. #TRX #TRON #tronix

4322 2018-01-10 18:42:46 I have a small position similar to yours but I am not worried. To balance out you could always buy more if it dips that low but I don’t see that happening.

4327 2018-01-10 18:42:21 DO NOT PANIC SELL TODAY! Market goes up, It must come down. Today is a down day. If there was constant price rise, crypto would be 2 easy
4328 2018-01-10 18:42:09 #Litecoin was used for moving 94% of all transactions between coins lately. That's proof that Litecoin is preferred for fast transactions and cheap to use even if it's just moving from crypto to crypto. Litecoin seems to be the preferred transaction coin by the market

4333 2018-01-10 18:41:45 That’s awesome. I’m late to the party but am aggressively learning crypto in my private studies under the mentorship of a couple of people who also spotted the trend and actually took action. Keep us posted on the business.

4380 2018-01-10 18:39:10 If you don’t mind, please explain a simple way to figure out gas prices as well, thanks!
4381 2018-01-10 18:39:05 Citi,  cannot be reliable source of crypto data.  I expected Japan,  South Korea, Zimbabwe and Venezuela to be in the lead
4382 2018-01-10 18:39:04 ビットクラブのシミュレーション：
1シェアー当たりの採掘量は，これまで一定値で近似できましたが，9月15日から減って来ています。2018-01現在は以前の1/6ぐらいに。採掘量の変動を考慮した形に改良してみてその減少ぶりにびっくり。
4383 2018-01-10 18:38:57 During steep price fluctuations, a lot of people rush to exchanges to buy/sell their crypto overwhelming exchanges. The break in trading ability is not a 'suspension' of bitcoin. The network doesn't go down, only your ability to trade on those exchanges.
4384 2018-01-10 18:38:57 Hey, trying to get a grips of the crypto world as a newbie. Looking to create a portfolio soon and i hope to use it to pay off my student loans for uni :)
4385 2018-01-10 18:38:52 IBM thought there was a world market for about 5 computers. 

If anyone dismisses #crypto outright have to take with pinch of salt, no matter how many billions he sits on.
4386 2018-01-10 18:38:51 Your insight, research and knowledge in the crypto currency ecosystem is admirable. Along with own research gives me confidence on own trades and investments. Thanks George! Open the insiders 
4387 2018-01-10 18:38:47 Free crypto advice, avoid ICOs.
4388 2018-01-10 18:38:39 This is exactly why the most profitable long term investments in crypto are represented by projects that are already backed up by real businesses.
4389 2018-01-10 18:38:38 $DGB is going to moon. where are the advisor ? @Crypto_Twitt_r @CryptoBully @CryptoHedge_ @bullishgentlemn - Beta $ios coming!!
4390 2018-01-10 18:38:33 Bch will never replace bitcoin, many coins today better faster cheaper than bch why bch?, btc still btc, and bch not btc
4391 2018-01-10 18:38:32 I find it interesting that a majority of #XRP/@Ripple doubters will throw their money at a #crypto with no significant company backing it at all.

Many times they hand their money to a few people that put up a website and may (or may not) have written a whitepaper, how silly.
4392 2018-01-10 18:38:21 What's chainlink? Is it crypto?
4393 2018-01-10 18:38:06 A very good project. I hope will reap success #Crypto #Blockchain #ICO #Profit #Crowdfunding

4395 2018-01-10 18:38:02 ripple and ethereum are ez money if anyone wants to invest in a new crypto since the bitcoin hype died
4396 2018-01-10 18:38:01 I wonder if he is talking about me? That time I refused to pay my parking ticket..
4397 2018-01-10 18:37:34 I've made over $500K in crypto. Here are some good resources and advice, especially for the new investors coming in.

4398 2018-01-10 18:37:34 Who was smart enough to buy TRX and XRP when they were low? Be smart people buy the dips and HODL. Dont ever sell at a loss. ATH on its way

4399 2018-01-10 18:37:31 Those are some wise words that the crypto community needs right now!
4400 2018-01-10 18:37:30 what about last 24h?
4401 2018-01-10 18:37:29 I'm so glad you found a way to make this crypto-centric!
4402 2018-01-10 18:37:24 Who's going to bail out the crypto investors?
4403 2018-01-10 18:37:14 Lmaoooo
4404 2018-01-10 18:37:08 Not on coinmarketcap though.
It used to be exactly the same as btc, slightly tilted to the left.
They should put it in green indeed
4405 2018-01-10 18:37:00 Hey @CoinExchangeio when will the $DRGN Wallet be fixed? It’s been under maintenance since it started trading, I want to get my tokens off the exchange @dragonchaingang
4406 2018-01-10 18:36:59 Awesome giveaway!
4407 2018-01-10 18:36:58 XRM7dm65pPHhJtA2y2LJs9eZ6aA8nBH85L
4408 2018-01-10 18:36:57 Indeed! Today is another good day!
4409 2018-01-10 18:36:52 Fucking love this idget spinners. Kids want one at every check out. Got six of em birdied somewhere on my couch right now, I’m sure.
4410 2018-01-10 18:36:50 Hey man! I’m really to new to this and wanted to know if you can store $icx on MEW? I’m gonna buy some $icx and $drgn on kucoin since they kinda dipped and then move them to MEW.
4411 2018-01-10 18:36:47 You asked for it 
4412 2018-01-10 18:36:37 this week:

4413 2018-01-10 18:36:35 We have solid expertise and experience in BlockChain and Crypto applications. In fact we are developing new coin's, DApp, Mining using Ethereum platform for our client and will be happy to demo the case studies once connected.
4414 2018-01-10 18:36:32 XP、PACどちらも寝かせているので他の通貨に投資する資金が少ない。んー。JPYオールイン！！
4415 2018-01-10 18:36:29 Warren Buffett has stated his certainty of crypto currency crash. 
4416 2018-01-10 18:36:25 I don’t think the Crypto-bubble bursting will effect the Gold Price much. A billion £ out of Crypto will cause a crash. That billion £ into Gold will barely be noticed. It is a considerably bigger market.
4417 2018-01-10 18:36:22 @crypto_bobby have a look at AppCoins
4418 2018-01-10 18:36:20 I think an eth/erc20-powered (b)arcade with a bunch of old games (+ microbrews) would be awesome!  Btw, my wife has independently suggested this idea, so it even has a hint of non-crypto-nerd validation... how many ideas in this space can say that? 
4419 2018-01-10 18:36:09 It's the Blockchain stupid...The value of the crypto relates to the the blockchain concept behind it.  People will soon realize this is about way more than fake $.
4420 2018-01-10 18:36:03 Have no idea how to do anything with crypto lol sorry
4421 2018-01-10 18:35:52 Do you think it will work? I'm very interested in these random companies who are getting in to #crypto
4422 2018-01-10 18:35:48 If you thought buying crypto was expensive in a bull market then now is your chance to buy for a deep discount. The train only stops for a little while  Don’t get Rekt by trading #hodl #buyblack
4423 2018-01-10 18:35:45 Into $btc or fiat?
4424 2018-01-10 18:35:36 I thought he meant he was trying to buy ETN or LTC!
4425 2018-01-10 18:35:25 Everything is trading at huge discounts right now. Stay tuned for some updated short term plays. #crypto #discount #letsmakesomemoney
4426 2018-01-10 18:35:23 No they are not. All 3 are different projects.
4427 2018-01-10 18:34:51 Greed!  Pure and simple. Will eventually kill crypto as we know it. Big gov will be brought in as “our saving grace” to help regulate the greedy.  it’s gonna be a slow demise. But we can fight it with quality information about quality products out there.
4428 2018-01-10 18:34:49 If you're trying to decide if a #crypto project is worth investing in. Ask yourself does a #decentralized #blockchain actually benefit the concept or are they just trying to cash in on the movement.
4429 2018-01-10 18:34:44 will it work while i have my crypto-wallet chain attached?
4430 2018-01-10 18:34:41 @BaidNation  not sure if relevant but check it out
4431 2018-01-10 18:34:39 Out of curiosity, I wanted to see where in hindsight the best return on investment would have been over the past week across #BitCoin, #VeChain and #Electroneum.

The answer?

Electroneum. Not even close. #ETN
4432 2018-01-10 18:34:36 Şu an için downtrend kırıldı. Biliyorsun crypto market her an değişebilir ama ben olsam satmam. 13500 stop koysun çok tedirgin ise. Ama sonra takip edip 11200 kıramazsa geri alması gerekecek
4433 2018-01-10 18:34:35 This what #people said about #BerkshireHathaway that #Buffett is saying about #cryptocurrencies: 'I can say almost with certainty that they will come to a bad ending and his #company still exists. #News #WSJ #CNBC #CNN #LATimes #Forbes #CryptoNews #BitcoinNews #cryptocurrency
4434 2018-01-10 18:34:28 When target plz sir?
4435 2018-01-10 18:34:18 Calm down crypto guy. Your starting to sound like that squirrel
4436 2018-01-10 18:34:15 Yalnız bende yem bitmiş. Sizde fazla var mı? 19XTYDnj8rFef5xrG1dFNh6F8YPKcge88o 
4437 2018-01-10 18:34:06 I couldn’t find the price too.
4438 2018-01-10 18:34:05 Absolutely, I think you can disagree with Buffett on BTC and crypto if you feel like it's just not his space. But it's "just not his space" for a reason; the guy has generated insane wealth. A little respect still in order, he's not some senile old fart.
4439 2018-01-10 18:34:00 Wheres crypto currency?
4440 2018-01-10 18:33:54 Pretty much a carbon copy of my altcoin investment strategy.
4441 2018-01-10 18:33:47 Crypto computing around Cheltenham.
4442 2018-01-10 18:33:41 3 hours to withdraw my #Crypto. What an abysmal system and service @krakenfx provide with absolutely zero @krakensupport. For being in a cutting edge technology space, at this rate you’re doomed. An aesthetically dated website that doesn’t function. Good luck
4443 2018-01-10 18:33:39 To buy 1 #Ripple, you'd need to trade 1.79 DQ chicken strips! #crypto #justaddwaffles #DQcoin
4444 2018-01-10 18:33:35 I just wonder if they have enough of regulations in matter of crypto to execute this.
4445 2018-01-10 18:33:33 Ben onu demedim. Bu crypto manyakligi bitince blockchain'den ne kalacak derdimiz. O teknoloji dedigin gibi cok onemli. 
Diger yandan atalarimiz demis: "Kendi dusen aglamaz." Atlamasinlar bilmeden, okumadan.
Biz o nedenle crypto parayla hele fiyatlandirmasi ile ilgilenmiyoruz.
4446 2018-01-10 18:33:27 We got multi-bagger weed plays, crazy crypto junk runners and bio's screaming outta the gate. I can't trade em fast enough.
$KODK $FTFT $AMRH $LBCC $NXTD $PTIE $LEDS $CANN $CNAB $MJNE $MCIG $NUGS etc etc etc.
4447 2018-01-10 18:33:24 Question, if your not selling at all, are you using other investments to buy more crypto or are you day trading with a % of what you already have?
4448 2018-01-10 18:33:24 Made only  150 % this week .. 
4449 2018-01-10 18:33:21 accept crypto?
4450 2018-01-10 18:32:57 Great job  neblio team. If you are not on neblio train jump quickly. This is most undervalued project in crypto space. This year in top 5.

4452 2018-01-10 18:32:55 Glad I havent bought any crypto that shiTS dying , and everyone talking about it has FAILED to show me cash LOL
4453 2018-01-10 18:32:52 it's adorable how stupid the crypto racists are.
4454 2018-01-10 18:32:46 There's already over  $731,603,277,251 worth of crypto-hype.   AI hype is nowhere near this!
4455 2018-01-10 18:32:37 Yes that will be awesome too :)
4456 2018-01-10 18:32:37 I’m not a fan of either but I would much rather see $XRP succeed than Bcash & it will, Bcash will hopefully die in the next year or 2.
4457 2018-01-10 18:32:35 Ok great. i will try to follow..no telegram?
4458 2018-01-10 18:32:12 Yay glad to see you invested in VeChain too <3 <3
4459 2018-01-10 18:32:11 I like that strategy. I'm new to all this but I bought a bunch around $0.03 and have been HODLing ever since. Though I am still up the numbers looked nicer at $0.28. Just riding it out now I suppose.
4460 2018-01-10 18:32:07 What about @officialmcafee tweet? How will you defend this? I can understand if you have wrong past but your present will decide future of so many people, 15JAN Lets See
4461 2018-01-10 18:31:43 @CryptosR_Us Hey George, what do you think of $eng? best white paper and team ive seen in crypto but curious of your opinion.
4462 2018-01-10 18:31:42 Definately Ripple is going up and will be $1000 end of 2018
4463 2018-01-10 18:31:42 No, making MONEY is the key, and always will be. Hell, we ain't curring cancer over here in Crypto land!!
4464 2018-01-10 18:31:39 No worries mate. I'm no crypto expert...but then this is so new, is anyone really? I have been in to it since 2012.
4465 2018-01-10 18:31:25 Yes, Yes it is
4466 2018-01-10 18:31:20 Hey, I noticed you do no have a logo. I make custom logos in exchange for crypto. Msg me if youre interested.
4467 2018-01-10 18:31:13 You are underestimating the buying power coming from Japan, South Korea and other non-institutional sources. Millions more are opening crypto accounts every week. The network effect can only be compared to the explosive growth of social media apps.
4468 2018-01-10 18:31:06 Rekt
4469 2018-01-10 18:31:04 Me the last 2 months:

*reading news articles*
"Ooo I wonder how this will affect crypto."

*checking the time*
"I should check my crypto, I haven't in 15 minutes."

*talking to literally anyone*
"Did you know about crypto?!"

This is becoming a problem.
4470 2018-01-10 18:31:02 And hopefully Vertcoin :)
4471 2018-01-10 18:31:02 Forex has lost its appeal. It's not "cool" anymore. Infact, it's financial suicide. The new generation does not want to trade currencies vs. AI. It's a guaranteed loss. Crypto is the new asset class and it is still in its infancy.
4472 2018-01-10 18:31:01 As for alts going to be in red marks... do buy now in dip position.

4473 2018-01-10 18:31:01 $LIGA rising from the dead?? If they’d just announce they’re building a crypto currency building or pothouse it’d help
4474 2018-01-10 18:30:50 Fake
4475 2018-01-10 18:30:45 Wow, the amount of hate i get for selling $TRX and $XVG. I didn't invest into crypto to join a fandom or cult. I'm here to make money. And #tron & #verge  made me ALOT of money. Which was why I decided to move on. I'm not a hypocrite, I just smartened up& learned from my mistakes
4476 2018-01-10 18:30:44 TA can be a helpful tool, but c'mon... In #crypto it's like shooting to people with blinded eyes. You gonna miss a lot.
4477 2018-01-10 18:30:40 Actual comments from the crypto presentation in the communal area of our office block:
- I don’t like banks, I don’t like central banks, I don’t like governments and I don’t care much for regulation either.
- I hate experts. 1/2
4478 2018-01-10 18:30:36 You can disagree with him. He's been wrong before (and admits it). But back it up with a sound argument, not "Warren Buffett is just old and out of touch. Crypto can only go up! #hodl 4 life."
4479 2018-01-10 18:30:32 One of the good ones. Thanks for all your awesome info and insights!
4480 2018-01-10 18:30:24 My feed is full of $ETC twitte. More action is coming.
4481 2018-01-10 18:30:24 バイナンスで買った銘柄軒並み不調
クリプトピアで買った銘柄軒並み好調
4482 2018-01-10 18:30:15 Because it pumped. Now it’s dumping. A coin growing over 100% is not organic growth. It’s a 10 billion dollar idea, nothing more atm
4483 2018-01-10 18:30:13 Which Crypto coin should one buy for a long term? 
4484 2018-01-10 18:29:58 it's at 4000k. you might have looked at VIBE?

4487 2018-01-10 18:29:54 So crypto next?
4488 2018-01-10 18:29:48 Alguien conoce un exchange de criptos que esté aceptando registros? #bitcoin #eth #crypto
4489 2018-01-10 18:29:46 Now this is a real #crypto day.
4490 2018-01-10 18:29:46 Wouldn’t be surprised if GDAX handed over all data if governments demanded it. A friend has made a fortune from crypto and he’s sucking it up and paying a mega CGT bill
4491 2018-01-10 18:29:29 To trade or to hold?
4492 2018-01-10 18:29:27 Today, I ordered my @LedgerHQ Nano S securing my crypto assets...If you have assets on exchanges, my dear, you are not in control of them yet, until they are safely kept in a hardware. #BTC #cryptocurrency #altcoins
4493 2018-01-10 18:29:25 Vechain went up 1000% in the last month. Crazy #crypto @vechainofficial
4494 2018-01-10 18:29:22 BitconnectX is a new ICO that Bitconnect just released this morning! Unfortunately i can't buy any because they exclude the US lol
4495 2018-01-10 18:29:21 Isn’t anyone else concerned that the kb3 price is going to tank effectively bringing our b3 investment under 1 shatoshi? I sure am.... there are some big bag holders out there, it’s concerning
4496 2018-01-10 18:29:16 ZACKLY!!!!

4499 2018-01-10 18:29:07 Crypto currency looking like the notion
4500 2018-01-10 18:29:02 Exactly,  no amount of AI hype will reach the level of crypto hype.  I think nocoiners simply are unaware as to what is happening in crypto-land.
4501 2018-01-10 18:28:43 Do you need a logo? I make custom graphics cheap in exchange for crypto. msg me if intereted. :)
4502 2018-01-10 18:28:40 Still HODLing mine too.., pain in the ass right now. They will bounce back tho. Just #HODL
4503 2018-01-10 18:28:39 Yes

4508 2018-01-10 18:28:32 Holy moly- he didnt like the internet when it first came out cause he didnt understand it --so u gonna listen why he comments on crypto?
4509 2018-01-10 18:28:30 Do you want your money stolen in web? Go to @cex_io they are professional on that :D #stolen #bitcoin #crypto #money #money
4510 2018-01-10 18:28:23 You said this industry is a bubble but that doesn't make sense. People say that when they don't understand. A bubble is like crypto. Crypto has no potential of making a lot of profits yet their stocks rise like crazy. Weed stocks have real products, real profits and a real market
4511 2018-01-10 18:28:23 order book wisppers... listen to it.
4512 2018-01-10 18:28:23 EDO take a look into it it's trying to become a system like coin base I believe. That's what it sounds like and is cheap at the moment for where it could go. Only a 140m mk cap and 22m in circulation. Just had a 500k coin burn
4513 2018-01-10 18:28:21 why is it going to HUGE on the 22nd of January?

4517 2018-01-10 18:27:48 Warren Buffett says crypto will come to a bad ending eventually
4518 2018-01-10 18:27:47 This is Fake! 500$ cannot be withdrawn or used to buy crypto.. it can only be used as transaction fees.. So YES Tricks YES Catch!
4519 2018-01-10 18:27:36 "Jim Breyer, one of the worlds top investors just listed @vechainofficial as an investment portfolio holding, along with $ETH, he has 2 crypto holdings."

4526 2018-01-10 18:27:02 Let's have a look at the numbers for today!
#Hashflare 1.2THs-> Payment: 0.00017149 #BTC
Total: 0.00126478 BTC
#CEXio #XRP : $2.17 (15.21 Units)

Well, hoping that the priceon Ripple will keep low a couple of days more at least. Later you can grow all you want 
4527 2018-01-10 18:27:01 I know the crypto genie is out already - but at this stage it is still like fog starting to spill over the sides of the lamp.  Banks/Govs are now diving at the lid and will try anything to clamp it down, just to delay.  But if news is a KO, then no dark ages for devs to work in.

4534 2018-01-10 18:26:23 Those that can't stomach Crypto, get out NOW. In the meantime, stop bickering about dips in the market. Everything needs a correction, prices simply don't just go UP and UP.

4540 2018-01-10 18:25:48 An awesome 1-hour interview was released today of which I think this clip is a part. He's very level headed throughout and we millennials can learn a lot from what he has to say. A HELL of a lot more logic and critical thinking coming from him when compared to crypto zealots.

4546 2018-01-10 18:25:29 So so so rich because of the crypto. Soon I'll be barking "Don't you know who I am???!" at you
4547 2018-01-10 18:25:28 Yes Quantum Computing is a threat to the crypto currency but it is not fair to insist so without explaining it is a threat to almost all the cryptography used in everywhere in the cyberspace at the same time.
4548 2018-01-10 18:25:18 Not seeing cost and sign up link but count me in!!!
4549 2018-01-10 18:25:12 Naive and unbelievably risky. Mom and Dad aren’t going to bail you out anymore and it’s not the govts job to protect you from yourself. Crypto currency is NOT backed by anything other than what others are prepared to pay for it. It’s the ultimate pyramid

4551 2018-01-10 18:25:03 I agree with you. I'm not an expert on crypto, i'll admitt that, but I have read up on trx and I do believe in the project, regardless of the hype around it :). 

Patience is not my strong side but the market is a harsh teacher :). And I, for that matter, a quick learner!

4554 2018-01-10 18:24:55 tycker generellt börsen är ganska ointressant just nu och medan det inte händer så mycket så finns det ju annat att skriva om. just crypto tycker jag är intressant ur ett stort antal perspektiv. råder dock ingen att investera i något de inte förstår.
4555 2018-01-10 18:24:48 what is cryptobirds? paid signal group?
4556 2018-01-10 18:24:44 He missed the boat and upset he didn't see it coming.  Marginally, crypto threatens the currency of the fortune he's amassed.

4585 2018-01-10 18:23:04 Please, tell us more about "businessing".

Generally, when people "business", particularly in the world of crypto, they have a solid plan and path in place. TRX has no plan. It is the Donald Trump of cryptocurrency. The plan is: winning.

Excuse us if that doesn't seem solid.

4596 2018-01-10 18:22:24 Yes, they support it. But exchanges are vulnerable and you depend on their tech and schedule. Crypto is about decentralisation and control you’re oen money. In your wallet you were 100% sure you got it on 01-01-2018. Good luck with Bittrex!

4600 2018-01-10 18:22:12 Do you think a corollary of that would be targeting cryptos and projects that have already survived 4 plus years? Longevity and experience are scarce commodities in crypto. These projects have at least shown a dedicated team and have been attempting to evolve, offer value.

4614 2018-01-10 18:21:15 Folks @ #xvg reddit: you can stop your 10.000$ challenge. Almost every coin is hardened against IP tracing to specific transactions. You would have to control A LOT of nodes to IP trace a transaction... This will proof nothing. Well, besides you knowing nothing about crypto tech

4662 2018-01-10 18:16:53 Would be very interested to know what info of yours they can actually get hold of. But simply looking at your bank account they could work out the gains of 99% of people from money sent/received from crypto exchanges
4663 2018-01-10 18:16:52 How are you currently thinking about asset values in crypto?  I know Chris Burniske proposed the framework of utility value + speculative value, but it seems like calculating utility value is too vague and nebulous right now.  Do you prefer a different method?
4664 2018-01-10 18:16:49 Hahaha its just a stupid law and encourages a dangerous and very speculative future for crypto, there's also no incentive to report alt coin trades, it's just sealing the fate of the us dollar and represents everything crypto is trying to fix
4665 2018-01-10 18:16:47 I dont know about other responses. But I hope this one helps. Trade etn in BTC not LTC. You can sell your litecoin on the Bitcoin market or sell your etn on the btc market too.

Now the BS doesn't work anymore - a correction is long overdue from FANG to Crypto to Auto loans to private debt - but #FOMC views the truth as damaging their reputation.

4688 2018-01-10 18:15:09 So how are you investing in crypto?

#BTC #LTC #ETN #ETH #XRP #XVG #TRX #XLM #ADA #crypto #cryptotwitter #cryptocurrency
4689 2018-01-10 18:15:08 Right lol
4690 2018-01-10 18:15:07 Great choice. CryptoBridge is awesome. They keep evolving and I'm positive this exchange will continue to grow. Because you own the private keys, the exchange also functions as a private wallet for your crypto. Win win.
4691 2018-01-10 18:14:56 I send them an email asking when I can expect my tokens that I bought with BTC until now no reaction back. Still waithing will be day 3 so lets see when I will get the tokens or a reaction to my email.
4692 2018-01-10 18:14:55 You couldn't of bought any yesterday with LTC. Maybe you misread the question.
4693 2018-01-10 18:14:54 
4694 2018-01-10 18:14:51 You should shill $dbix to celebrate 70k.
4695 2018-01-10 18:14:48 the conference must be Real World Crypto(currencies)
4696 2018-01-10 18:14:41 Agree with this. But this is first what comes to your mind when someone promised you smtng months ago calling it soon. 
Why not to clarify: cards will be produced between X and X, shipping process will take X days?
4697 2018-01-10 18:14:39 $LEND is a safe coin, the industry and product is amazing, their team is working so hard. The bigger the Crypto market becomes the bigger LEND will become. This might take a little bit of time so #HODL $XRP $BTC $ETH $XVG $TRX #cryptocurrency

4714 2018-01-10 18:13:20 Seems reasonable. I would like to know what I can do to help Litecoin gain more adoption. What do you suggest? I do tell everyone I know that Litecoin is the future spending platform of crypto. But other than word-of-mouth free advice what do you recommend?
4715 2018-01-10 18:13:14 Forget buybacks and dividends If you want your share price to go up just launch a crypto currency.
4716 2018-01-10 18:13:12 It looks fancy for a once large company but this will always be a good news for crypto, could spur a good talk around the corporate world that could eventually drive them into using blockchain and cryptocurrencies.

4733 2018-01-10 18:12:04 Ripple won't make it because of the market cap. We'll have to see about cash. Good luck anyway. I am hoping for the same outcome just as much as you are.

4737 2018-01-10 18:11:48 Tips for anyone who is new to investing/trading in crypto:

1: Do your own research
2: Don't chase the green candles (e.i. buy the red sell the green)
3: Never buy when prices set a new all time high 
4: Plan your trade
5: Trade your plan

4739 2018-01-10 18:11:34 IMO @cburniske when BTC catches cold and ETH/BTC is close to all-time low, it is rational to move your crypto into ETH  (positive sentiment wrt to Casper and transaction volume makes a it easier).
4740 2018-01-10 18:11:33 100 JPY(BTC): 1185.739 ~ 1186.952 KRW(BTC)
4741 2018-01-10 18:11:33 Standard what? Do you even realize 60% of XRP is owned by Ripple labs? Centralized much? Even the nodes get chosen by Ripple labs. Do some research, its the most centralized crypto out there and goes against everything crypto is trying to solve.
4742 2018-01-10 18:11:14 Cant be waiting 5 years  make it happen now brother

4775 2018-01-10 18:09:05 Market cap , I believe, applies to companies  that are centralized. It does not apply to Value of currency. You cannot use last value of crypto coin to calculate market cap.

4789 2018-01-10 18:08:13 I'd be amazed if they caught many this early on in the crypto game tho.  Maybe they'll need to bust one big fish to make a widely publicised example and get more people declaring.  they simply wont know where to look for the time being
4790 2018-01-10 18:08:09 I hear you, in crypto terms what I meant to say was my small portion or BTC is more of a hodl for me and since LTC is quick with low fees I will use LTC a lot more if amazon excepts it.  And with atomic swaps down the pipe line that will be good to.
4791 2018-01-10 18:08:07 Is your name crypto booger dude? Lol
4792 2018-01-10 18:07:59 So.... $VEN whales are doing a little test pump?

4793 2018-01-10 18:07:59 I gave some to my wife, son and a friend.  I wanted to show them the power of fast method of a payment method. They won't get rich off what I sent, but they now have a better understanding of the power of crypto currency. #ltc #KnowledgeIsPower

In dismissing him as a sexist we mustn't forget his real flirtation with this worst of political Devils.

4802 2018-01-10 18:07:15 My confidence that Charlie and LTC will do it all and prevail in the future is near 100%.  My fear however is that a Crypto Dark Ages is on the horizon in 2018. But not If mass world adoption occurs this year.  Then govs will have to say "what's the use of regs / genie is out."

4809 2018-01-10 18:06:30 For those apart of the crypto mentorship group, I hope you enjoyed the call from 2 days ago on the dip for $XRP. $1.30 - $1.80 range. Buy the dips and HODL.

4814 2018-01-10 18:06:15  you obviously know shit about crypto if you think you can ask for some pump tweet to boost the platform with few bilions of dollars
4815 2018-01-10 18:06:13 Time people like this spend on shouting around about 'crypto=fraud' is for others enough to make it to the early retirement using it. That's the difference.

I guess it's how much you want, not everyone have the same financial situation. Maybe just send what you want/can and think that they are max 100 people, so subscribe only if you need to. Just guessing, but that's haejin style to teach who want to learn.
4835 2018-01-10 18:04:52 Is that a joke ?
4836 2018-01-10 18:04:51 no idea. had an idea earlier today to cook up a fake IRS twatter account and go and wind up some of the noisier US  crypto fans who are boasting about how rich they are

4862 2018-01-10 18:02:36 Yeah what governments can do is try. The jin is out of the jar now. What i believe is 2nd or 3rd quarter of 2018 will be the worse for crypto.

all those billionaires arent touching it because crypto serves to disrupt the system by which they obtained their wealth
4867 2018-01-10 18:02:23 @cryptomanran you’re hosting the big names in crypto and don’t have @SatoshiLite on this list? What are you thinking?
4868 2018-01-10 18:02:23 We're going to see more of this. Buffett saying he'd take a 5-year long on crypto is the most honest thing anyone of merit from wall street has said. Even then he retracted afterwards which tells me one thing. Wall Street's fucking scared right now.

4877 2018-01-10 18:01:32 No, the fact is XRP has an exceptional amount of transparency within their business, especially in the crypto world. It’s a double-edged sword. You will hear the good along with the bad.
4878 2018-01-10 18:01:30 Great insight Ari. It looks like it’s setting up into a classic bi-modal distribution with clear winners and clear losers. I feel uneasy about using market cap to say which side a particular crypto is on. Probably looking at actual utility and MC as a secondary effect

4902 2018-01-10 17:59:37 Banks (if they have any inkling of crypto) will be using Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies to send Warren's and Charlie's payments.  Warren will pay them thousands in wire fees, but banks will incur pennies in expense and will be able to wire (i.e., send crypto) in seconds.
4903 2018-01-10 17:59:35 Crypto is a bubble because they can say they are getting into these coins and their stocks rise a lot but have no profits or way of making any money. With cannabis you have a 20 billion dollar industry by 2020 and it's just getting started. Real products, real profits.

4929 2018-01-10 17:57:59 Yes major banks are using the technology ripple across the world but XRP (what Everyday Joe holds) will not reach $100. XRP and the company Ripple are very different things ... and the company holds more XRP than I am comfortable with ... short term you will make profits not LT..

4938 2018-01-10 17:57:28 The vast majority are just getting in on the crypto hype.

4940 2018-01-10 17:57:20 Yeah, it's a shame that the banksters in your country feel they can get away with banning people and freezing their assets over legitimate business transactions.  Eventually you'd run out of banks.  Maybe buy other assets (like gold/sil) with crypto for a more reliable way to TX.
4941 2018-01-10 17:57:19 Institutional investment strategy: buy alts instead of #bitcoin. Pump price of alts, trade for $btc on dips, rinse & repeat.
Eventually I think bitcoin will rally back with a vengeance.
4942 2018-01-10 17:57:16 Mobile technology + crypto ($HTML) ;) is the way forward for developing countries
4943 2018-01-10 17:57:13 its happened, years back and its happening again, Governments are taking their last shot at Cyrpto, either they will give up or crypto
4944 2018-01-10 17:57:08 Missed the boat on this one. No way I'm jumping in now..
4945 2018-01-10 17:57:08 NICE!

4952 2018-01-10 17:56:40 One of my Rules for 2018 was no explicit crypto talk on the TL.
4953 2018-01-10 17:56:36 Please, please, please.
4954 2018-01-10 17:56:34 Have you heard something about a rumour that OMG have bought/will buy Etherdelta?
4955 2018-01-10 17:56:27 100 JPY(BTC): 1190.077 ~ 1193.155 KRW(BTC)
4956 2018-01-10 17:56:26 Despite all new really BIG announcements, why is $TRX going down? Why? 
4957 2018-01-10 17:56:25 I think learning the hard way is most effective cause after summertime $DGB I chase no more pumps lol made a lot more money cause of it
4958 2018-01-10 17:56:23 Bitch
4959 2018-01-10 17:56:23 $BLOC only $28M shares o/s im pretty confident the float is less. This low float crypto play is just beginning to take off. they have 6,666 antminers incoming and investment in $KODK
4960 2018-01-10 17:56:19 That wasn't my intention pal. I'm just cheering it. My last buy was at 6k.
4961 2018-01-10 17:56:14 Good luck tarnishing your name even farther in the crypto community
4962 2018-01-10 17:56:08 Not a glitch! someone bought 1 INS on etherdelta for $129. Won't last though haha
4963 2018-01-10 17:56:01 People stop listening to other people! This isn't a get rich scheme! Buy what you believe in and hold! Trust me these are all fake crypto wanna be pros! There is no rhyme to reason business! You never know who is pumping and who is going to dump.  #xrp…
4964 2018-01-10 17:55:58 But is the new user accounts unblocked tho?
4965 2018-01-10 17:55:57 haha, no. It's a photography rights and licensing eco-system w/ their own currency. There's zero real details, even less about the crypto currency and the website is buzzword of the moment soup.
4966 2018-01-10 17:55:52 good to go!
4967 2018-01-10 17:55:46 I sold early and misplayed this one so poorly it hurts. Happens. 
4968 2018-01-10 17:55:43 I’m just a little salty as it cost me a lot of money to transfer from their stupid ass wallet , had to send BTC to  the wallet to pay the transaction fee

4971 2018-01-10 17:55:39 If he was ANYTHING like a 'prophet', he'd have gotten in on the unprecedented astounding moneymaking opportunity of the crypto market, even if he believed it to be a bubble.
4972 2018-01-10 17:55:36 this whole crypto thing is going to be ugly soon
4973 2018-01-10 17:55:29 I'm pretty sure that bitcoin is going to wind up the Myspace of crypto. I'm still in pretty deep on ethereum (and very happy about that).
4974 2018-01-10 17:55:24 I am so thankful I got into #mindfulness #mediation before I got into #crypto. lol. Gotta set your intentions and walk away (unless your day trading). Refreshing the browser won't change shit.

4976 2018-01-10 17:55:18 @CryptoGat has a video already walking ppl through ED
4977 2018-01-10 17:55:13 Anything behind this rise or just crypto?
4978 2018-01-10 17:55:07 ATMS since 200 sats
4979 2018-01-10 17:55:06 Not an accusation; just a genuine inquiry.

Are you actively blocking followers who disagree with Verge? 

A little perplexed after a fellow crypto-enthusiast attempted to access your daily tweets and found himself blocked.
4980 2018-01-10 17:55:03 Ripple and bcash are pretty much the turds of the scene. Everyone that understands the importance of crypto beyond a tradeable asset should be throwing themselves on the front lines, getting the word out there. God speed to you all.
4981 2018-01-10 17:55:03 Take a look at FUN it’s under valued and they have a major quarter 1 launch 
4982 2018-01-10 17:54:58 Still can jump in or its too late? 
4983 2018-01-10 17:54:58 Of course that’s the best advice. It’s insane to recommend anything else to noobs. Right now crypto investing is a full time job
4984 2018-01-10 17:54:43 I am by no means giving you advice for investing your money nor am I in any way a financial/crypto advisor....I just like money but.... fuck yes
4985 2018-01-10 17:54:43 back then no one tweeted stuff like "i wouldn't buy it" to us tho
4986 2018-01-10 17:54:40 Seriously, a 70% stock price jump is something we are used to in the crypto world, but the traditional stock market? That is something else. I’d be interested to see a list of other stocks with price jumps like that over the past 3d...
4987 2018-01-10 17:54:33 Yes PLEASE!!!
4988 2018-01-10 17:54:32 Just saw your 1k-5k tweet, I can be easily persuaded to re-evaluate my target

4993 2018-01-10 17:54:08 Same old same same. Park it here and wait for the check. It goes thru the machine and the machine profits off it 10 ways but pays u out in only one. In p2p crypto we want to make this “honest”

5020 2018-01-10 17:52:26 Saying that blockchain provides value without crypto just proves that you have no idea what you are talking about. If a blockchain is centrally controlled with no peer to peer network then you would be a fool to use one over a cheaper and infinitely faster database.

5027 2018-01-10 17:52:08 I would love to see this at least once a week, continuing the solo every day.
5028 2018-01-10 17:52:07 back up a bit and ask how banks would use *any* crypto if that the case. Unlike BTC, say, bank doesn’t need hold XRP
5029 2018-01-10 17:51:55 He doesn’t use email and is fairly unintelligent.  Pretty sure he won’t be able to wrap his brain around crypto
5030 2018-01-10 17:51:51 That's a low conservative number. It'll probably be $1 before February is over. might see $12 by END 2018. time will tell. People speculate all day. mass adoption/partnerships/restored confidence will drive this coin upward organically nobody wants an artificial pump and dump
5031 2018-01-10 17:51:51 My plan until about June is 40% BTC dont touch it, 25% ETH, dont touch it.  ALT/BTC with the rest until I figure it out some more.  ETH hodl is unsexy but also almost 2x since xmas...

5034 2018-01-10 17:51:40 Wait who is this guy again?? Does he even crypto? :P
5035 2018-01-10 17:51:38 The level of immaturity in the crypto space and the lengths at which people will go to FUD other projects is absolutely fucking disgusting and disgraceful to this technology. You don't want regulation? Then regulate your fucking self. #cryptocurrency
5036 2018-01-10 17:51:38 all $mu has to announce is a "crypto currency memory" and stock will gap open to 100 dollars lol.
5037 2018-01-10 17:51:33 I teach my friends crypto basics, how to 123 everything and I teach them with Litecoin. Its so easy and convincing when using Litecoin, payments sent in few minutes for almost zero fee. Litecoin and Monero, thats our horses here.
5038 2018-01-10 17:51:31 but in all seriousness, do you have a .2 BTC ($3k) course where I can learn to make real money? Like on Forex or something legitimate like that?
5039 2018-01-10 17:51:31 Fair enough, I don’t mind admitting to being wrong on that! (Note that I am actually a revolut premium subscriber...). Any plans to allow sending crypto from the app?

5043 2018-01-10 17:51:19 It’ll be great when they use their crypto holdings as collateral for a loan the way people would roll their debt into mortgages, and with the same eventual outcome.

5049 2018-01-10 17:50:54 Hard to gauge - Between $100B out of crypto market cap since Monday, FUD, and current downtrend. Oddly enough, the daily MACD's havent crossed yet & with that in mind it could easily reverse. $.50 - $.75 EoQ1 fair estimate.

5091 2018-01-10 17:49:04 Crypto currency discussions are literally in a different language I don't even have a basic understanding of it
5092 2018-01-10 17:49:04 Key words? “For now”.
5093 2018-01-10 17:48:59 mee too... i would ask why nxt... do you believe in an increase?
5094 2018-01-10 17:48:59 Crypto bruh
5095 2018-01-10 17:48:54 becoming a "Crypto bitch"
5096 2018-01-10 17:48:51 Chew on this, most of us(not me anymore) let our money sit in a bank and collect zero interest while they lend our money out and make 10-25% interest a month pay us nothing, Meanwhile we wanna call lending platforms that involve crypto currency scam because it pays us everyday
5097 2018-01-10 17:48:46 処理したアルトの指値バラマキ大会終了。同数買い戻せたら勝利。
朝楽しみにします
5098 2018-01-10 17:48:40 Is that clear enough? I cant make it any clearer.
5099 2018-01-10 17:48:35 Must of invested their last cash in Crypto
5100 2018-01-10 17:48:34 yeah there is the crypto play for esports in $UKG -- @rahulsood has been on CNBC before I believe
5101 2018-01-10 17:48:34 Thanks to otaku coin, I can see what the general fanbase thinks about the idea of crypto. I've realized that there is a MASSIVE language barrier, and that mainstream adoption is still probably at least 7 years away
5102 2018-01-10 17:48:27 Okay so KodakCoin is here. Now waiting for GECoin, FordCOIN, BeeGeesCoin... and ... hat-tip to @craigmatsumoto  -- KTelCoin. It's retro crypto fun everybody, dive in! #cryptocurrency $KODK

5104 2018-01-10 17:48:25 Why in every cycle do people take shots at this guy and say he is out of touch?  When he says "I don't understand it", he doesn't mean that he doesn't understand it".  Dude has probably plowed through everything written about crypto in between bridge games and Gorat's.
5105 2018-01-10 17:48:20 Yeah I did, let me repeat myself: 2nd layer is LN, being developed by independent groups. Sidechains are a different subject all together and are not related to 2nd layer/LN.
5106 2018-01-10 17:48:19 Govt of India should legalised crypto currency in India. @GoenkaSandeep
5107 2018-01-10 17:48:15 also the movement of my brain and life,, how interesting

5109 2018-01-10 17:48:15 My least favorite exchange by far.  I can't transfer ETH or Tokens from my Nano S to the exchange for some stupid reason.  Anything that makes it less of a ball-smashing experience would be welcome.
5110 2018-01-10 17:48:14 What you buy with depends on your situation. At first you buy with fiat. Later you decide whether keep buying with fiat or crypto. If you earn a salary and have savings each month , i recommend to spend more fiat at first ,agressively.
5111 2018-01-10 17:48:14 U mean soon 2b National Crypto-Coin Holdings Inc.?
5112 2018-01-10 17:48:07 Anybody in $crb? $crypto
$rdd still  to the moon though. 
5113 2018-01-10 17:48:06 And crypto currency?
5114 2018-01-10 17:48:04 I think it has a lot of potential, actually. It's in my crypto portfolio.
5115 2018-01-10 17:47:55 That was tough! 
5116 2018-01-10 17:47:53 Can’t wait until people shut up about crypto currency. If it wasn’t about to crash, you still wouldn’t know about it.
5117 2018-01-10 17:47:50 Do you think ICOs using lumens will have any affect on price? Like Mobius and others.
5118 2018-01-10 17:47:47 Wonder what the trading algorithms think of $BB investing in blockchain and releasing a crypto currency $bbcoin. *watches stock quadruple* #notreally
5119 2018-01-10 17:47:45 It’s definitely beneficial to know how to use it. Do it up!
5120 2018-01-10 17:47:40 koptum :) bencede iyi taktik 
5121 2018-01-10 17:47:36 from skeptic to ref shilling to BSD trader in a couple months....ahh crypto, gotta love it
5122 2018-01-10 17:47:36 So he was wrong on the biggest exchange at the time... like many others. I'm sure you've made bad crypto trades as well as everyone else.
5123 2018-01-10 17:47:35 Been at it since October. Always down to chat about crypto.
5124 2018-01-10 17:47:32 You're just now figuring this out? Do you even crypto pleb?
5125 2018-01-10 17:47:28 Hi Sam! I brew my own kombucha — one batch every 22 days. In other news, can I pick your brain about your crypto sentiment analysis? I’m new to this space and curious to learn more.
5126 2018-01-10 17:47:25 a fucking joke... and i hope it fails
5127 2018-01-10 17:47:25 Goldman Sachs: “cryptocurrencies function without central banks may make them valuable as inflation hedges or stores of value, but also makes them vulnerable to demand-driven fluctuations in price.”

5134 2018-01-10 17:47:03 @HeyRhett I have been supporting your ambitions on re-working $ZCL from the beginning. However, being a holder of $ZCL has brought up an opportunity to create a new platform that could be of daily usage to the crypto-community. I would like to propose an idea.
5135 2018-01-10 17:47:01 Crypto analytics going to solve which lane to be in. traffic frequency modulation the same thing.
5136 2018-01-10 17:46:57 @RMGCharlie just to let you know to shut up Rover. I’ve been in crypto for 2 years. I’ve invested 2200$ in total. I have paid my truck off and half my mortgage on my house allllll from crypto profits.

5141 2018-01-10 17:46:44 These core shills have barely been in Crypto for 6 months... no idea who the important real leaders in this space have been. Roger has done so much for Bitcoin and crypto adoption. Blockstream comes in and destroys the community.

5149 2018-01-10 17:46:28 It's fascinating to watch r/CryptoCurrency right now. Thousands of crypto "investors" praising themselves for discovering basic market principles over and over again.

5151 2018-01-10 17:46:26 now this is my kinda crypto.
5152 2018-01-10 17:46:20 Currency is defined by a mass of people continuously debating and agreeing on an abstract items worth. Is crypto is any worse than others?
5153 2018-01-10 17:46:12 Warren Buffet without question an intelligent investor with a slew of advisers and plenty of Fiat bag$ of bankers $hit notes. Stick to your Fiat based system and out of the Crypto sphere .   Crypto Cryptic
5154 2018-01-10 17:46:07 Love seeing crypto giveaways, this is an awesome community! Thanks!
5155 2018-01-10 17:46:06 Qui a besoin d'investir dans les crypto monnaies quand on peut compter sur un seul festival de iencli
5156 2018-01-10 17:46:06 This looks like my first fee months in crypto lol. Then i looked back and saw how stupid I was being.  I still swing trade but only if it gives me more coins without losing money and only on certain high volume average assets. Its amazing what a great entry can do in the long run
5157 2018-01-10 17:46:05 My son invested just a few quid in another crypto currency, a few weeks before Xmas, and his £300 investment peaked at £6800 the other day (less than 2 months in). Being the pragmatist that I am, I forwarded your tweet from the other day. He’s letting it ride though 
5158 2018-01-10 17:46:02 If you’ve got fiat, nows the time to use it. Blood in the streets and exchanges opening up registration in a few days. Looking good. #contrarian #endofbeartrend #bulltrend #crypto #fiaittocrypto
5159 2018-01-10 17:45:50 Idk, it doesn’t seem like it’s over. I need #XRP to top at 4.
5160 2018-01-10 17:45:47 Heard you on @crypto_bobby's happy hour and Crypto Street podcast. Both great interviews and a must listen

5169 2018-01-10 17:45:32 its about to go a bit higher the Roger crew is heavy with the propaganda today
5170 2018-01-10 17:45:28 Sorry WHAT WAS THAT?? I couldn't hear you! The M6 cabrio I bought out of the 30,000% percent I earned on XRP in 2017 is nice but the winds gets a little noisy.... you'll have to speak up!! lol #GetALife #changetherecord #sourgrapes #xrp #Ripple

5173 2018-01-10 17:45:18 @dgardner @PTetlock Hey! Loved the book. Any thoughts on #crypto prediction markets like @AugurProject & @GnosisPM? #Superforecasting
5174 2018-01-10 17:45:16 Should consider a crypto currency
5175 2018-01-10 17:45:13 how easy is it to cash in your crypto currency or once I buy it, I can never get real cash out?
5176 2018-01-10 17:45:12 The website does not mention the amount to be transferred to different addresses
5177 2018-01-10 17:45:05 Sweet..thanks charlie

5179 2018-01-10 17:44:47 I’d like to offer you an opportunity to buy into my new crypto currency: Arbitrary Coin.

It’s worth whatever you want.
5180 2018-01-10 17:44:46 Second worst crypto currency with germans involved
When the devs insult critics ("she needs to be slapped") the only good thing you can do is stay away 
5181 2018-01-10 17:44:35 I can't believe a guy who probably soils himself on average 3 times a day is causing people to sell crypto at a loss.
5182 2018-01-10 17:44:35 Need some of this good news!
5183 2018-01-10 17:44:24 I make myself laugh better than anyone else!
5184 2018-01-10 17:44:23 As of now zcash is the smallest "crypto blue chip" - as the 2 billion line suggests
5185 2018-01-10 17:44:18 Looking for a better cross section of entire #crypto space, MY followers follow b/c of charts (in USD mostly), but hopefully the bill from $TWTR comes near the (c) wave low in #bitcoin.

5188 2018-01-10 17:44:05 @JRell274 hey bruh what platform do you use to trade crypto? Thanks...
5189 2018-01-10 17:44:02  I just did research lol. The crypto forecast said it was gonna be the coin to gain the most value this year.
5190 2018-01-10 17:43:59 Out of 800 crypto - currencies about 8 - 12 will stand the test of time.

5193 2018-01-10 17:43:55 Solid coin, long term hold.
5194 2018-01-10 17:43:54 Both blockchains are currently active, and the old chain will not be stopped until February 12.
5195 2018-01-10 17:43:52 buying tips never ends up being a long term win, buying well structured companies with great employees is a good idea, no matter what the pundits say, which there are plenty of in the crypto space.  Research ripple’s team and business model and let me know your thoughts.
5196 2018-01-10 17:43:29 oh trust me i wanted to kick it on a coin as well. I cant risk NOT having it in a few months LOL.. SO tempted tho!! Plus the banks doing the loans are all sorts of twitterpated on crypto for income\etc. They arent sure how to treat it unlike having $$ in a 401k , etc.
5197 2018-01-10 17:43:26 Aynen sen baya sordun cevap bile vermedi arkadaş kaç kez şahit oldum :) Demek @cryptokemal i kötü yere götürmüş @CryptoCadet vay vay... Ben olsam Kemal'in yerinde Cadet'i kuyu kebabı ısmarlayacam diye İstanbul'a çağırır gelincede telefonumu kapatırdım

5199 2018-01-10 17:43:23 What if crypto is what ultimately enables AI to rule it all?? By linking any digital & (shorlty) physical asset to a block chain & issuing currency against it, any rule-based system can own and monetize said assets. From Kodak's digital rights venture to autonomous vehicles.

5204 2018-01-10 17:43:00 IF you're not ZOOMING out to look at where a Coin has been, and probably where it will Go Again..   you're doing it wrong..   Crypto Charting can be a bit different since you have a Standard($BTC) that moves around enough, and has done SO WELL this year, that charts are skewed
5205 2018-01-10 17:42:59 I guess $7 in 3 months.
5206 2018-01-10 17:42:48 2/ Meanwhile United, Delta, and American have 100s of millions of people earning, spending, donating, and converting billions in their currencies (airline miles) annually and they generate billions in profits.  Can't wait until they announce a crypto project?!

5207 2018-01-10 17:42:47 Hi @crypto_bobby. It could be a good idea for a video with tips such as leaving some ETH in your wallet to withdraw your newly purchased crypto or they'll be stuck on the exchange. The current ETH congestion isn't helping either
5208 2018-01-10 17:42:46 IOTA is like lithium. You know it’s the future of energy but gas and oil aren’t done yet. Too early to buy IOTA!
5209 2018-01-10 17:42:42 @Ripple #XRP #xrpthestandard with crypto still being in its infancy it is amazing how many financial advisors are on twitter.  Spreading FUD with no research.  I think I might have to start a stupid category to file them in.
5210 2018-01-10 17:42:38 Bittrex uygulaması değil.Portföy takip programı. Blockfolio ismi.
5211 2018-01-10 17:42:38 Definetly! Would love to see that
5212 2018-01-10 17:42:33 I don’t think they’ll even really be able to enforce it. People writing these laws have no idea what crypto really represents anyway they’re just trying to get their cut
5213 2018-01-10 17:42:32 If you are not comfortable, the coinswap will also be automatically processed on Coinsmarkets, once the servers are back online.
5214 2018-01-10 17:42:32 Yes! That would be awesome. Scared to make a huge mistake using it
5215 2018-01-10 17:42:30 Idk man, I'm not that cool to predict the longterm future the people would forget what I said! What I see is that there's nothing for me in $XRP for now
5216 2018-01-10 17:42:29 $BLOC news today shows that the market is hungry to see good deals happen in the crypto space. Whilst betting on Coins is not my preference, but it's up 27% on 5M+ shares. This bodes well for all the companies that are going to show real catalysts to their shareholders

5218 2018-01-10 17:42:21 Warren Buffet is a master at reading the market; fear and greed.  His opinions on the crypto markets bring fear.  We just peeked a few weeks of exponential growth feeding the greed.  IMO its an opportunity for new Fiat to enter the crypto markets. Coinbase, release the hounds!
5219 2018-01-10 17:42:19 I'll give everyone some prime crypto advice if I get over 100 followers. #promise #Crypto #FUD
5220 2018-01-10 17:42:12 Now More Established Companies Are Getting Gripped by Crypto Mania. More well-known names move to join craze in all things bitcoin. Buffett raises doubts, says digital coins will have bad ending.
5221 2018-01-10 17:42:12 Crypto is going to change lives for the worst or better. Please be smart with your investments and don’t trade off emotion #cryptotipoftheday

5242 2018-01-10 17:40:42 The philosophy of the rich and poor is this: the rich invest their money and spend what is left. The poor spend their money and invest what is left. #crypto
5243 2018-01-10 17:40:41 Valid point. But consider Stocks as a medium to exchange goods and services like currency? That shows altogether a different picture. The thing with any crypto today is there is no solid recognition of what is a true currency. Any token sale can potentially act as one
5244 2018-01-10 17:40:36 I sold just over 1 euro with big regrets, I like the project, many strong use cases that will be pulled from the industry asap as ready.
5245 2018-01-10 17:40:34 An interesting move isn't it. (cc @RobertHayden ) Linking a plausible idea to track royalty-based images using a fiat crypto-currency. Unlike a government, this currency is underpinned by that titan called Kodak. Is it almost crazy enough to work :>

5309 2018-01-10 17:36:13 But Zuck doesn't have most of his wealth in dollars. It's in FB stock (and other stocks) which should have the exact same value (in theory) even if everybody starts using crypto's. The same goes for almost everybody else, right?

5321 2018-01-10 17:35:05 To hell with GOLD. All it does is keep the central authorities and elites in power because they own way more than everyone else. Crypto currency is much more than a wealth transfer, it's a transfer of POWER. #Bitcoin #Litecoin $BTC $LTC

5368 2018-01-10 17:32:20 Yes, I know that. I was just looking for a brazen way to distribute my reflink 
5369 2018-01-10 17:32:11 the play is -> forget $XRP, buy $QASH or $WAN instead. Set it and forget it.
5370 2018-01-10 17:32:08 Every #crypto has #FUD to clear up. This is a major step fwd regardless of your opinions. The biggest gains result from good business, not hype. But say what you will. If I feel generous in a few years I'll send you a postcard from the #moon my friend.

5381 2018-01-10 17:31:14 The insider trading in cryptos is atrocious. Everyday there's coordinated pump and dumps of no name currencies that jump 200% in a day then you never hear about them again. Once cryptos and crypto trading are SEC regulated its game over.

5454 2018-01-10 17:26:01 De jacht op het crypto geld is een enorme energie slurpende business volgens mij. Levert geld op en gebruikt mega veel stroom. Waanzin.
5455 2018-01-10 17:25:59 put $ into crypto and watch as it goes whooooooosh down the shitter. Why?
1. Unregulated
2. Untransparent
3. Illiquid
4. Overhyped
5. Unsecured
6. Zero market history
7. Overvolatile
8. No intrinsic value
9. No intrinsic utility
10. Someone is getting rich, hint-not you.

Tulips!
5456 2018-01-10 17:25:56 
5457 2018-01-10 17:25:54 Twitter owns the crypto space because in order for the crypto masses to move to another (possibly decentralized) social platform, the thought leaders must go first. Why would they leave if everything they built up is here?
5458 2018-01-10 17:25:52 You are right, I haven't thought about that. People in crypto tend to focus only on the technical stuff. That's probably also the reason why they turn towards trustless solutions. Buying/using a hardware wallet is not a trustless process though.
5459 2018-01-10 17:25:51 Got talking to my #bank manager about #crypto investments - was really enthusiastic about it. Oh, the irony.
5460 2018-01-10 17:25:49 I don’t see he price to pay  Is it priceless?!
5461 2018-01-10 17:25:42 I’m adding more Tron to my portfolio.  How many crypto currencies have developed the partnerships that TRX already has?  People are overlooking the value and development that TRX has made in a short period of time.
5462 2018-01-10 17:25:38 Top 15.
5463 2018-01-10 17:25:36 I think cryptocurrency market has been manipulated just like the way gold and silver are manipulated. Ever since BTC has been on future, this market has became stale. Our crypto is in devil’s hands
5464 2018-01-10 17:25:33 "Buffet is wrong on crypto" is bold. I mean, are we all that drunk rn?
5465 2018-01-10 17:25:33 Why does Bradley keep sending everybody my way about crypto?!

5466 2018-01-10 17:25:30 It doesn't now.l because TRX went up.   The lowest now is TRX which us at 11 c.

5472 2018-01-10 17:25:11 I'm still going strong on $ELLA. Since the price pump lately it's become the most profitable coin based on my Nvidia rigs on WTM.
5473 2018-01-10 17:25:09 Can you do a verge update? Because no one anticipated what coinmarket done. So it didn't work out as you forecasted. Also can you do price predictions on the following coins:

5475 2018-01-10 17:25:02 $GTFO coin ICO - Get the Funds Out is a super basic coin used for siphoning fiat out of the system into crypto.

The concept - a web store where you buy an image - you determine the fiat price & get the image & a BONUS amount of $GTFO coins corresponding to the fiat. 
5476 2018-01-10 17:24:57 Whats the price Sir? Can’t see it on page…
5477 2018-01-10 17:24:52 virtually no one investing in crypto understands crypto other than the words "it's the future!" Not even the CNBC talking heads, it's just been going up, so they are buying it. Just like I don't understand oil drilling.

5481 2018-01-10 17:24:46 I always feel with a lot of shitcoin white papers, the devs will say lots of crypto/blockchain terminology - which sounds amazing to the average guy, but sounds ridiculous to any blockchain experts  #Bitcoin

5502 2018-01-10 17:23:36 So not the reoccurrence of the cup, but the way there is a start and end point to a full cycle which seems to repeat itself over and over. Other charts I notice when the pattern cycle is broken it typically is a trend change e.g bullish to bearish.

5507 2018-01-10 17:23:23 Tam Bir noob gibi konustun. SC Tam Bir yalanci tribuncudur. Ama sorun bu degil. SC ve benzeri coinlerin gelecegi olamaz. Bunun bir tweete sigmayacak sebepleri var. Sen hobi olarak yine al. Mal çok. Piyasa henuz bunlari bilmiyor. El opmeye beklerim.
5508 2018-01-10 17:23:23 Deep in #Neblio and just picked up some #Ethos today!
5509 2018-01-10 17:23:20 What's the cost for the master class?
5510 2018-01-10 17:23:10 $dgb, has bday today. Dont agree though, they seem to be working on a lot of features.
5511 2018-01-10 17:23:09 Isn't that the guy to made $1.5 million in one crypto trade and everyone is talking about it???!
5512 2018-01-10 17:23:09 Beware the head fake!  It should come down to 11k!
5513 2018-01-10 17:22:54 Yes basically.  Just like when they say they are shutting down exchanges. Never happens.  The energy side I have no clue about.  I do know that entire towns/villages economy revolves around crypto mining.  Good luck telling those people they can't do that anymore.Chopper ride inc
5514 2018-01-10 17:22:39 Crypto Note: ETH for the win today - everything else losing :(
5515 2018-01-10 17:22:27 Don't want to sell losses ... How long do u predict we have before the train leaves ?
5516 2018-01-10 17:22:26 Let's not start a lynch mob here folks.  Goertzel got funding from a community invests in a lot more worthless ideas than Sophia the robot.  It's their money to lose (or gain).  They know much more about investing in this space (i.e. crypto) than you can possibly imagine.
5517 2018-01-10 17:22:26 I really missed out on Railblocks. I saw it at 3 dollars and then bam 30 dollars. However i didnt miss out on DeepOnion. From what i have personally witnessed in the DeepOnion community i vote DeepOnion. #Cryptocurrency #crypto. #privacycoin #DeepOnion #Tor @DeepOnionx
5518 2018-01-10 17:22:25 Internet doesn’t produce money, it is someone’s loss to others gain. #bitcoin #ltc #litecoin #Crypto
5519 2018-01-10 17:22:25 Truth. RT @AriDavidPaul: 5/ And yet...crypto is undervalued.  How can that be?  Because the store of value use case has an addressable market greater than offshore banking, which is $20-$30 trillion.  But this is likely winner take all, or will follow a power law distribution.
5520 2018-01-10 17:22:23 And not only taxing is the issue, Crypto currency is more like gambling. A lot of middle class people are investing by taking out money from savings or by using credit cards. If it crashes suddenly then all the people will cry on govt not on themselves for investing at 1st place.
5521 2018-01-10 17:22:21 Right now split between $DNR and $ELLa while I wait for my next spec play to launch
5522 2018-01-10 17:22:21 @Ogie0218 do you think ICOs are bad for the crypto space?

5528 2018-01-10 17:22:01 It's not the technology that's bad (blockchain), it's the use in creating Cryptocurrency. I do not know a lot about crypto but everyone says it's so secure and permanent but the seem to get lost or stolen quite often....no thanks.
5529 2018-01-10 17:22:00 Have faith. Fear is causing resistance. It will come back up.
5530 2018-01-10 17:21:59 Crypto has aged me more in 7 months than anything in my life. I’m gonna have grey hair by June. Hopefully grey hair leads to retirement by 2020 though. Still my goal. For real.

5535 2018-01-10 17:21:29 Well it’s bollocks. Bitcoin is bitcoin. Xrp is xrp. We got Lebron James. He wasn’t the next MJ. He was the new him.
5536 2018-01-10 17:21:29 Already hearing these hot takes: "just cuz these geezers didn't get in on the bottom of the crypto boom, they talkin' shit about the new paradigm... stocks are for losers!"
5537 2018-01-10 17:21:27 What are you mining these days?
5538 2018-01-10 17:21:23 Was deciding nebl on this dip or etc ...

5543 2018-01-10 17:20:56 Hello Haejin, the website doesn't mention what price it is to sign in ?
5544 2018-01-10 17:20:54 I sure hope so
5545 2018-01-10 17:20:54 i ment crypto-twitter

5547 2018-01-10 17:20:47 Will the price correct itself after the initial reaction or is this a sign that the block chain crypto phenomena is growing on peoples minds?
5548 2018-01-10 17:20:35 At what price are you hopping back in on ripple? #ripple #xrp $xrp

5549 2018-01-10 17:20:33 Same here. I came from stocks and quickly learned that Crypto is very very different. There is no sleep. News effects it in weird ways. And 50% swings are very common. Imagine if Google dropped 50% in a day lol. It would destroy the financial institution.
5550 2018-01-10 17:20:30 I’m buying more Tron.  How many crypto currencies already have the partnerships that TRX has?  People are ignoring the value and progress that TRX is developing.
5551 2018-01-10 17:20:29 shut up
5552 2018-01-10 17:20:28 His name is Satoshi Nakamoto, not the one who started Bitcoin but for a while, everybody thought it was him.
5553 2018-01-10 17:20:27 If btc drop to 5000, it will be demonstrating for all crypto investors. You can see 100k maybe 2-3 years later:)
5554 2018-01-10 17:20:25 I won't be able to attend Jan 20th I hope you offer another class soon after. I'm follower of your work and deeply enjoy your tutorials. Beautiful stuff.
5555 2018-01-10 17:20:24 @ec_valouzz Salut ! Tu conseilles quoi comme wallet pour stocker les crypto monnaies ? Je sais pas du tout quoi utiliser. Tu as quoi toi?
5556 2018-01-10 17:20:14 She's also a Crypto lesbian.
5557 2018-01-10 17:20:06 Lol yep.. 10% crypto
5558 2018-01-10 17:20:03 But I'm not doing it
5559 2018-01-10 17:20:01 fuck crypto invest in gold
5560 2018-01-10 17:20:00 so whats your play on XRP?
5561 2018-01-10 17:19:54 Hmm, I've heard alot of skepticism about Elliot waves being a meme but I'm new to crypto/ta and don't have an opinion on it, what do you think?
5562 2018-01-10 17:19:52 Says free but has transaction I’d and your addresses.  How much?
5563 2018-01-10 17:19:51 Solves Perceived Crypto Asset Problem Of Demand Drying Up...
Unending Institutional Dividend Demand...
It's Genius, Isn't It?
5564 2018-01-10 17:19:49 And crypto has accelerated the process Nfold
5565 2018-01-10 17:19:48 Yeah, no kidding. I was talking about the replacing crypto Twitter argument. Extremely unlikely, not eventually.
5566 2018-01-10 17:19:48 That is perfectly fine by me

5569 2018-01-10 17:19:20 Lol. These are the worst coins in crypto. Are you sure you've done your research right?
5570 2018-01-10 17:19:18 Maybe we're a bit too fast to judge and stuck in static mentality ('By Design' bug closure) here. Step back and ignore the technical challenge for a minute, really, and think first if the ask makes sense. Then put your big boy pants on and go back to work on the white board.
5571 2018-01-10 17:19:14 I think there’s an intrinsic behavioural pattern that’s at play: phone is there 24x7, so are the markets, we’ve matured past fake news, and Facebook fatigue and this fills a void. Crypto markets always-on and highly liquid = lots of story, lots of gameplay + potential for big $$$
5572 2018-01-10 17:19:09 Same here. You don´t have to do anything for $crypto #Airdrops
5573 2018-01-10 17:18:56 Ask not what your crypto can do for you,  but what you can do for your crypto
5574 2018-01-10 17:18:56 Real #JFK of crypto right here.
5575 2018-01-10 17:18:43 He was just creating FUD as long as possible, so he could fill lots and lots of heavy crypto bags
5576 2018-01-10 17:18:43 price please :)
5577 2018-01-10 17:18:43 RE: Cost 
Since he gives his analysis for free and even provides some educational videos for free, maybe it's by donation?

5592 2018-01-10 17:18:07 Thanks, didn’t want to make an investment then see Disney swoop in and take it all.... but then again WHAT IF Disney did that and now was a majority owner in crypto .... hmmmm. 
5593 2018-01-10 17:18:03 I gave my friend $500 to invest in a new crypto when i was blacked the other night. And now it’s up $1300 hahaha
5594 2018-01-10 17:18:00 Economically stagnant areas should create hands-off tax free and low infrastructure cost zones for #cannabis and #crypto industries. Get in on the ground floor and ride the waves.
5595 2018-01-10 17:17:57 Tho i'd suggest greenhouse... even if the didn't accept crypto payments
5596 2018-01-10 17:17:52 So I have to send all of my Crave to an address and you will burn them and send me new coins? That sounds like a pain in the ass and also somewhat dodgy.
5597 2018-01-10 17:17:50 About to pick up some more $DNT while it’s still down bang bang! @crypto_rand
5598 2018-01-10 17:17:47 Haha! I see what you did there!
5599 2018-01-10 17:17:41 This tweet is wrong on so many levels. Please sell all your crypto and buh-bye!

5602 2018-01-10 17:17:35 I think $ETH is just increasing the bubble just by allowing anybody to start an e-coin.There are about 200 country backed currencies and about 4000 crypto currencies right now and growing. People are investing in crypto in short like in forex but with ZERO backed value, Danger!
5603 2018-01-10 17:17:34 C'est bien la crypto
5604 2018-01-10 17:17:31 The second the governments has a problem with crypto currencies and the actual $ that they are supposedly worth, it will all disappear. The government has zero barriers to entry. It can...and will create its own before they choose to adopt just one.
5605 2018-01-10 17:17:24 Awesome.
5606 2018-01-10 17:17:23 Blockbuster said the same of Netflix. Borders vs Amazon. Taxis vs Uber. Hotels vs AirBNB. — And he doesn’t know anything about Crypto, because if he did we would be discussing Blockchain...which IS the game changer.
5607 2018-01-10 17:17:20 What is the cost? Doesnt say..
5608 2018-01-10 17:17:09 Aha, is that the telegram you have attached to your profile?
5609 2018-01-10 17:17:04 There are crypto winnings? Who knew?
5610 2018-01-10 17:16:56 It's absurd. People that proclaimed stocks as too risky are going into crypto for quick gains. Only put money into crypto that you can afford to loose.
5611 2018-01-10 17:16:40 Why you being so... crypto. 
5612 2018-01-10 17:16:35 It's the new cryptocurrency (but only "crypto" over HTTPS, and not much of a currency either).

They score 66% on mine! @pavelbains is their advisor , NEO QTUM! Few weak point but worth to be checked!
5620 2018-01-10 17:16:21 @bitconnectx  while still in ICO stage, please consider adding $XVG to your exchange

@LegolasExchange - while still in ICO stage, please consider adding $XVG to your exchange also. 

All of #Crypto space is going to want access to #Verge.  It would be nice if you could offer it.
5621 2018-01-10 17:16:17 Considering the fundamental idea, I think the team is capable of pulling this off, even though some of the developers are junior. The mcap is way lower than current competitor OmegaOne and pre-sale is already oversubscribed + high lvl (!) crypto capital companies are in this.
5622 2018-01-10 17:16:15 Shit I would do it too and I’m trading crypto now. Who in their right mind wouldn’t do a 5- year put options... all in... but I’m PRO crypto. No FUD here
5623 2018-01-10 17:16:13 I really like you as a trader Anton, but you don't have a name in Crypto. You just look like you want to be a name like John McAfee now.
5624 2018-01-10 17:16:13 Put it in this way: the drawing that your grandson is carrying out on the tablet at this time perhaps has the same value as his grandmother's Colombian emerald, both made of bits of quarks. #CES #Crypto #Fintech #Cryptocurrency

5630 2018-01-10 17:15:56 hey Haejin, is there a price on there?  I didnt see it
5631 2018-01-10 17:15:56 You seem like a well educated dude man. I’m not saying you should throw life savings at crypto but because you seem like you aren’t afraid of research I encourage you to make some of this crypto money I am team the people I just want to see everyone soar
5632 2018-01-10 17:15:51 The dopamine hits and feeling they can get it back and make security a more highlighted issue in their future makes me believe that most ppl wouldnt quit crypto due to a hack.  ESPECIALLY, if it was only 1/5 of their portfolio or less due to using various exchanges.
5633 2018-01-10 17:15:51 Échale un ojo a la crypto currency!
5634 2018-01-10 17:15:45 By far one of the worst crypto investments you could make. Hold them bags. 
5635 2018-01-10 17:15:37 
Only if it has a crypto tie-in
5636 2018-01-10 17:15:31 Crypto quote-of-the-day:

"Shit coins are WAY overpriced"
5637 2018-01-10 17:15:31 This is why XLM will  soon they are solving real life world problems and companies are signing up to use it ...
5638 2018-01-10 17:15:28 I 100% agree. For me, TA is a forensic tool upon which to study history, or the relatively of movement. I believe crypto can be more readily understood by analyzing the market as a socio-psychological phenomena with a technological underpinning.
5639 2018-01-10 17:15:25 Its funny when people freak out over #Crypto corrections. #CoinMarketCap correction, etc. Perfect time to buy

5641 2018-01-10 17:15:17 lol you are naive. how exactly bitcoin will help those who poor? they just buy and hold it? top kek. this is nothing but attempt to tax those who had huge gains in crypto and living in ukraine.

5649 2018-01-10 17:14:35 Lol TA. Take time to understand @cryptodemedici logic of trading and IMHO, the most important part especially trading crypto, market anticipation and the balls to not follow the herds on $bch and make tons of $$ out of it. TA comes later. ALWAYS.
5650 2018-01-10 17:14:33 This is how crypto works. Especially in the alt coins -- expect +100-200% and then retrace of 50-75%. $XRP will be worth $5 by the end of Q1, 2018.
5651 2018-01-10 17:14:30 Over the last few months I have read multiple posts(at least 20) on Reddit where people post their stories on how they take out loans to invest in crypto and they have no prior knowledge on investing. The result was that most of them sold low and bought high. #CryptoNomad

5658 2018-01-10 17:13:56 I luckily got in at .69 usd
5659 2018-01-10 17:13:54 Why i cant see a price?
5660 2018-01-10 17:13:53 Crypto is a pyramid scheme. The last to join will lose it all. It will be poor people thinking they've found an out. The rich will get richer.
5661 2018-01-10 17:13:50 @BigEasyShiller what wallet do u recommend using ? Especially if I have a variety of crypto
5662 2018-01-10 17:13:49 stop manipulating things for your own stake. the whole crypto industry is dependent on BTC. this is premier coin and about 99.99% coins are paired with bitcoin. you act so unprofessionally. this is bullshit man. this is seriously drastic for crypto industry if this happens.
5663 2018-01-10 17:13:43 Shivers? WTF, I can't take crypto seriously anymore
.
5664 2018-01-10 17:13:42 @WarrenBuffett It's not the 1900s anymore! Crypto's are the future of investing!

5665 2018-01-10 17:13:41 Problem is to many investors and not enough merchants! If you’re self-employed and you’re invested into any crypto currency and you’re not excepting crypto currency as payment, I don’t know what to tell you.

5669 2018-01-10 17:13:32 Hey Paisano, when are you going to make a Vid about the FFMs networks and how they are disrupting the whole Crypto Space!
5670 2018-01-10 17:13:29 Right, but I still don't understand what exactly in this chart you draw the conclusion of manipulation from. Swing is bigger in the ETH chart for example, volume spikes are just as crazy, so is that manipulated as well? You can find this in crypto charts anywhere if you just look
5671 2018-01-10 17:13:28 Crypto investors are demonstrating their immaturity and impatience.

5676 2018-01-10 17:13:21 Price info?
5677 2018-01-10 17:13:19 Oh cool, thanks for tip. It would be awesome if it turns out that the supply is actually less, we’ll see i guess
5678 2018-01-10 17:13:15 How do you feel about $trx

5682 2018-01-10 17:13:03 price information is missing
5683 2018-01-10 17:12:55 So, apparently a lot of people still wants the "people list". I will see how to add it today, maybe under a "Most followed crypto people" category. I am still working on a way better categorization of tools for cryptotrading
5684 2018-01-10 17:12:54 how do u know?
5685 2018-01-10 17:12:47 exaclty, you can never win from fan boys hehe :P, but everone has there favorite coins, I never fall in love with a coin , I am just here for solid profit :D
5686 2018-01-10 17:12:46 I'm a full time crypto trader, so you can bury your assumption there. The market (Alts) is grossly overvalued...but will continue to grow
5687 2018-01-10 17:12:45 How much is it?? i didnt see the price listed
5688 2018-01-10 17:12:44 True that’s exactly my point he isn’t involved so saying something that your not involved in is doomed to fail is strictly an educated guess. Problem is there are already Crypto Gurus that are far superior to buffet in the said markets. The warren buffet of crypto will emerge
5689 2018-01-10 17:12:30 price?
5690 2018-01-10 17:12:26 What r ur top 3 buy At the moment ? Thanks for funfair tip btw.
5691 2018-01-10 17:12:23 Really appreciate all the work you are doing and sharing with the crypto community. Thank you!
5692 2018-01-10 17:12:22 Could there be a connection btw these ‘new breed’ of noobs and ripples recent surge? 
5693 2018-01-10 17:12:18 @EvanCoins I have to do a 15 minute presentation about cryptocurrencies (I chose the topic even though I don't know much, yay me), what can I talk about if I want to focus on the crypto part with a backup on economics and currencies? pls save me
5694 2018-01-10 17:12:13 Teşekkürler saolun
5695 2018-01-10 17:12:07 It doesn't say how much it is for the group session
5696 2018-01-10 17:12:06 Umm that is not true... As long as  vendors accept coins, it will be fine.
5697 2018-01-10 17:12:00 You sound like an old stock broker who can’t handle the quick markets of crypto and sold too early.
5698 2018-01-10 17:11:54 What's the price
5699 2018-01-10 17:11:48 @ScottWLovesYou do you still have posts about crypto management?
5700 2018-01-10 17:11:35 what's the price?
5701 2018-01-10 17:11:33 Why hodling still pays off:

$ELLA - held since 1500 SATs

$DNR - held since 2000 SATs

Just to name a few.

5707 2018-01-10 17:11:15 i am so mad at those who are trying to manipulate things for their own stake. the whole crypto industry is dependent on BTC. this is premier coin and about 99.99% coins are paired with bitcoin. please stop manipulating people this is bullshit man. you are not professional anymore

5720 2018-01-10 17:10:51 We should not unfollow @Bitcoin, we are the ones hopefully preventing new people from starting out in crypto based on a lie. Is BCH valid? Yes. Is the BTC Twitter channel the place to advocate for BCH? Probably not. Does it sound like misleading? Yes. Is it helping anyone? No.

5729 2018-01-10 17:10:23 As more and more #altcoins are formed on the #Ethereum platform, doesn't it make sense that ETH becomes a more reasonable bellwether for the #cryptocurrency market?
5730 2018-01-10 17:10:22 When?
5731 2018-01-10 17:10:21 I have created a support group for newbies in cryptospace. teaching about coins/scams in group meetings. Now 29 members and growing. Many of the are business owners and would like to adopt crypto into their daily business
5732 2018-01-10 17:10:18 Will be deleting this Twitter it’s been good before I go will post a new twitter to follow me on for crypto related tweets mainly if you want come Jon me on the journey
5733 2018-01-10 17:10:18 You can research as much as you want about #crypto but I’ve found you really start to learn once you’ve dived in!
5734 2018-01-10 17:10:15 idk bout you but i did
5735 2018-01-10 17:10:14 Thanks for the advice Hallowe'en Jack. But if i wanted crypto advice I'd ask Easter Eddie, and if I wanted action, I'd talk to your sister.
5736 2018-01-10 17:10:11 Since May 2017 I have seen my initial crypto investment multiply by 6. This has allowed me to set 2018 aside to travel whilst being a "Crypto Nomad". The one piece of advice I can give is to always have a backup plan since the entire market could crash tomorrow. #CryptoNomad

5759 2018-01-10 17:08:42 You don't get it! Bitcoin and other crypto currencies just work because of the game theoretical aspect to solve to byzantine generals problem. Without that a blockchain is just a slow inefficient distributed database. In most blockchain use cases you can just use a database
5760 2018-01-10 17:08:40 I understand crypto, bought and spent btc for nearly 2 years. It's a bubble.

5767 2018-01-10 17:08:01 I) Credit cards made the decision to block all prepaid crypto debit cards. Without notice and without allowing people to withdraw their money. With, as always, with the greatest contempt for users.

Anything that goes 4x in 10 days is on the up. @justinsuntron  knows what he's doing. HODL. This is a long term thing.  #tronix #tron

5788 2018-01-10 17:06:46 I) Les cartes de crédit ont pris la décision de bloquer toutes les cartes de débit crypto prépayé en circulation. Sans préavis et sans permettre aux gens de retirer leur argent. Avec, comme toujours, le plus grand mépris possible pour les usagers.

5800 2018-01-10 17:05:57 TRON can back up all their work.
Google their developer. Google @justinsuntron or Jack Ma. It's the best of the best working towards better world standards.

5806 2018-01-10 17:05:30 $neo is a safe bet for 2018. Just like $eth and $ven

5813 2018-01-10 17:04:59 Buffett would buy a 5y put on every crypto. In the end I agree with him but 5y is a very long way to go. I do expect $BTC going to at least 100,000 and all other crypto going up x10 x100 at least before the whole crypto market collapses like dot com or tulip mania $LTC $ETH
5814 2018-01-10 17:04:58 This is huge news. I wish I could afford more #tron #trx $trx — I don’t know anybody in the crypto world who is more active in business and/or Social media than #Justinsun . He’s a giant — failure is impossible
5815 2018-01-10 17:04:54 2018 Prediction: Jamie Dimon leaves JPM to start a crypto fund
5816 2018-01-10 17:04:52 you learn something new everyday!
5817 2018-01-10 17:04:47 We are working on

5820 2018-01-10 17:04:38 Have you read warren buffets book? I have, he’s a one of the GOATS of stock market trading, not crypto tho, he’s not to big on investing in new technology at its conception. This is par course for him. My point is do your on research there’s a lot of money to be made in crypto
5821 2018-01-10 17:04:30 His friends hid accounts with Pilatus and Dubai banks quite well so far but yes crypto is the way forward to avoid the increasingly sticky problem known as correspondent banks.
5822 2018-01-10 17:04:26 i share your pain.. what a faff it is.. hopefully the gains will be worth it though!
5823 2018-01-10 17:04:24 Even if I don’t make any money by investing in crypto, I’m glad I went along for the ride because this shit is just cool to learn about and talk to people about #crypto #xrp #trx #lend #xvg
5824 2018-01-10 17:04:16 They claim to be the @Oracle of crypto. Going to be a secure data storage option. This will become essential and is running on ERC-20. Trust it. Send it.
5825 2018-01-10 17:04:14 $100 is my goal on this one!
5826 2018-01-10 17:04:11 @justinsuntron is laying the foundations here and that is key. It's 9 days into the new year and TRON is a new development crushing it in only a years time (not even). Just because Crypto is on a "get rich quick" mentality does not take away from the process of building a company
5827 2018-01-10 17:04:08 Nailed it
5828 2018-01-10 17:04:05 What do you guys think of Warren buffet saying crypto is gonna drop? #crypto #cryptocurrency
5829 2018-01-10 17:04:03 So, stock traders/banks r trashing #bitcoin and #cryptocurrency?  What else is new?  Obviously they will.  It is their antithesis.  My guess is that the people who made those bag phones trashed the flip phone as the flames engulfed them. #crypto #FinTech
5830 2018-01-10 17:04:00 Eh! Regulation brings stability which encourages the masses to buy also you can’t just ban a crypto- based transaction; it will increase its value anyways. I will take out the word ‘definitely’ here.
5831 2018-01-10 17:03:50 #Buffett also said 'I get into enough trouble with things I think I know something about, why in the world should I take a long or short position in something I don't know anything about'

Therefore he has ZERØ credibility regarding the securing of these #crypto #moon BAGS 
5832 2018-01-10 17:03:48 @jshocrypto do you think of possibly that something bad can happen on crypto and your whole investment can go bust?

@BaleineFR @Capetlevrai
5842 2018-01-10 17:03:19 Unbelievable $TRX still is this cheap. I feel blessed. Really. I will buy and #HODL until there's nothing left to buy.
5843 2018-01-10 17:03:15 What about the value of xrp, ?, Compared to other crypto,s ,
How about peer to peer xrp transfers
5844 2018-01-10 17:03:14 Yes of course! We should all benefit from novices who are trying to pay off student loans, buy cars, pay off credit cards and make crypto mainstream. Exactly!!! Wow, you're my hero!

5852 2018-01-10 17:02:26 @warrenbuffett #blockchain tech is the future. Your fiat money will be worthless in 5 years, and you’ll also be dead by then, so your comment on putting a five-year put on every crypto is laughable 
5853 2018-01-10 17:02:23 I want to see a crypto currency called mycoins for sassy black women

5857 2018-01-10 17:01:48 My investment strategy for this 2018:
> More on emerging markets.
> A lot more on Crypto.
> Adding more on those who develop technology & tools (software).
> Less on regular old school Banking and more on Fintech.
> A bit more on crazy ideas that "don't make sense" at all.
5858 2018-01-10 17:01:43 The move will probably be to drop every dollar and hold funds in crypto currency instead.   And then we'll be lucky if the dollar is worth the paper it's printed on.   But maybe not.   It's wait and see.   

Things are not rosy.   They never are.
5859 2018-01-10 17:01:34 This is one of my favorite things about doing this... keeps the mind so crisp. The $ is just a bonus that happens as a result. win-win. Thanks $crypto ... also... growing to enjoy this community of like-minded weirdos who do this too.
5860 2018-01-10 17:01:29 This is false. Capital control and regulations over the Korean won and crypto-exchanges generate the premium, not necessarily unproven mischief.

5863 2018-01-10 17:01:11 Ima start judgin bitches like crypto currency..are you a long term investment or a pump n dump?
5864 2018-01-10 17:01:09 It would take less than 2x for Ethereum to surpass Bitcoin...if it gets close, then I think it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Vitalik is also crypto's Elon Musk, a good person to bet on.
5865 2018-01-10 17:01:02 いつそうなってもおかしくないですね´ω`*
5866 2018-01-10 17:01:00 Who cares if they hired some dude?  You realize $drgn happened after $etn and has done worlds more. These guys are like, hey we hired this dude after 2 months. It is as if they are just waiting for someone else to come along that actually makes it happen
5867 2018-01-10 17:01:00 I suspect most crypto assets trade off of their relationship wrt to Bitcoin or their peers projects. ETH/BTC has declined significantly while BTC had its run and the market is bouncing back. The question is; will it go to the previous high?
5868 2018-01-10 17:00:59 lol .. its was a epic .
5869 2018-01-10 17:00:58 Securties lending using crypto assets will be a huge trend in 2018 - do you agree @NickSzabo4 @SatoshiLite #cryptolending
5870 2018-01-10 17:00:57 Yup. Crazy. I was interested purely from growth but how is this supposed to go anywhere!? Probably still will. Crazy crypto.
5871 2018-01-10 17:00:54 Wow! Cryptopia’s CEFS is now worth 0.8 #BTC!! How cool is that!  #CEFS #Cryptopia #crypto
5872 2018-01-10 17:00:52 Beginner or not in a market driven so heavily by hype and news wouldn’t you say that you will more often than not stand a better chance trading through sentiment over technical analysis?
5873 2018-01-10 17:00:41 
5874 2018-01-10 17:00:31 But what does it mean? That market cap isn't a good figure to judge value? Is this even a good value indicator? Everything is speculative yet we're all seeking a reliable crystal ball--me included.

Follow-up Q: What if a different crypto was used as the common denominator?
5875 2018-01-10 17:00:28 $wgr is bullish mr cat
5876 2018-01-10 17:00:15 Anything can go lower in crypto, my last buy in was at $2.40. I won't be adding anything more for awhile till it figures out where it wants to go. It could easily go past $3.00 or drop to $2. Who knows. Beta is coming soon.
5877 2018-01-10 17:00:14 Really appreciate the intelligent approach you take with crypto, man. A lot goes over my head,  but I'm learning
5878 2018-01-10 17:00:10 Wow, a really well explained example of how cross border payments work and how crypto could help. Only small point that Ripple might help in this, is that the transaction from CAD -> XRP -> PHP could be atomic. Hairdresser does not need to hold the XRP themselves. #xrp #ripple

Sure $ETH can be a slow mover, but it's got the PEDIGREE,& it supports over 80% of all Crypto Assets in the Crypto Universe..  To say that $ETH is Integral is understating it!

5907 2018-01-10 16:58:33 Man 2017 has been a crazy year for crypto. The number of people in it now is growing quickly. I have yet to see if crytpos act like the stock market...I always want to compare, but cryptos are very different...24/7 and worldwide with people investing who have never invested

5914 2018-01-10 16:58:14 Someone was called 'Isi Omo' (OMO detergent head...basically a rib) at a family gathering last week and the 2 parties were discussing investments, I did a serious double take cos I was pretty sure I heard FOMO. Crypto no go kill me.
5915 2018-01-10 16:58:02 Moved profits out of $knc into $ada at a dollar thinking it would go again. Backwards af. Now I'm hodlin till whenever it goes back over. Once I get that back, I'm sittin on it till the bears come back instead of buyin at the top like a scrub everytime
5916 2018-01-10 16:58:01 put ETC into that list :D
5917 2018-01-10 16:57:42 Yes, 1) Cut off the cable box and stream (no mainstream media) 2) stop going to movies (Hollywood) 3) Divest from the  Dollar, go crypto 4)  Divest from Wall St, go crypto.  Attack/boycott (((their))) Industries.  Hit them were it hurts so they collapse.

5920 2018-01-10 16:57:23 Good article, and I'd like to add:

Decentralization is the solution, which usually comes at a high cost. However, with crypto currency we can have decentralized administration in the context of a unified global capital market.

Interesting times.

5924 2018-01-10 16:57:10 You don't want to mess up your asset with this crypto.
5925 2018-01-10 16:57:07 This is a conspiracy to drive prices down so buffet can heavily invest in crypto

5931 2018-01-10 16:56:38 Mr. Buffet's statement appears to contradict one of his basic investment precepts; to avoid things he has no knowledge about. The reason he completely missed the emergence of the tech titans and may also be wrong about crypto.
5932 2018-01-10 16:56:35 Neither one of us know how it came about, so there is no right or wrong. We just have the facts....  

I just can't cut bankers any slack.  Not after experiencing the housing bubble and witnessing all the slack these robber barons were given then.  I'm not going to to do it.
5933 2018-01-10 16:56:33 I believe in verge , and you would have to pry it out of my cold dead hands. I’m fucking sick and tired of all these greedy fucks pumping good projects and then crashing them down into the ground. So please sell and don’t come back so the investors can start seeing natural growth
5934 2018-01-10 16:56:31 Off topic. How often do you use etherdelta? Because my goddd, tried it yesterday and probably the most frustrating 4 hours ever. Nightmare to use!?
5935 2018-01-10 16:56:20 フォローも頂き、有難う御座いました！今後とも宜しくお願い致します！
5936 2018-01-10 16:56:06 How about that $EOS move! Our subscribers have now had the potential to profit up to at least 45% on this pair, and if they entered in the support zone, then over 60%, since we posted the set up about a week ago! #cryptocurrency $crypto $btc #bitcoin
5937 2018-01-10 16:56:05 100 JPY(BTC): 1198.710 ~ 1199.932 KRW(BTC)
5938 2018-01-10 16:56:04 So your saying I should double up at least 
5939 2018-01-10 16:55:49 Exactly. A correction like this is pretty common after big runs. If this seems unusual to someone, they probably haven't been in crypto as long as they claim.

Stay tuned. They haven't even listed yet. You have a couple of weeks. Learn to use etherdelta till then.

Even I hate ether delta, buy you gotta evolve!

5952 2018-01-10 16:54:03 Hocam Xcp ile ilgili haber doğrulandı mı , bilgin var mı? Fiyatı yükselmiş biraz.
5953 2018-01-10 16:53:57 In crypto, when a coin is too heavily weighted to benefit its founders then it is criticized

In tech we should freely criticize "sharing economy" companies that don't distribute value and profits to their blue collar workers
5954 2018-01-10 16:53:57 @CapX_Official Can you guys do the voice interview with 'team us crypto baller' youtube channel? he can generate so much hype look at loopx, and an interview will bring more trust to the platform
5955 2018-01-10 16:53:54 easier for him to say, he dont plan on sticking around for another 5 years, :P he's already 87 year old
5956 2018-01-10 16:53:48 DYOR. If this project still doesn't convince you, just sell. In this crypto world it seems that if the partner isn´t apple or wallmart or something like it it´s never enough.

5960 2018-01-10 16:53:43 Saying “mathematically impossible” to people without a maths background tends to get ignored.

Better way to put it: “crypto backdoors are done with math, and numbers don’t ask to see your badge before they play along.”
5961 2018-01-10 16:53:29 This is an important point from @notsofast . yes we all want profit but #Blockchains projects are way more than that. Buying crypto assets should also mean you support their project, u walk along with their Dev and you acknowledge that good job takes time.
5962 2018-01-10 16:53:25 Haha tip dont pay the whole thing off then your bank in US will drop your insurance and your new insurance rate will be to the #moon. woes
5963 2018-01-10 16:53:19 Q: What service or tool would a fast growing chain store restaraunt use to accept crypto at the point of sale? What is state of the art nowadays?? Asking for a friend.
5964 2018-01-10 16:53:17 And what he probably means is that the average Joe trying to get rich will fail, that does not mean crypto will fail. And I think he's right, millions will lose a lot of money in this game.

5989 2018-01-10 16:51:57 I agree, there will be a "great filter" in crypto and I see about 20 projects with enough community, development, support and purpose to pass through it. The vast majority of projects will crash and languish if theyre lucky, or community/ devs will abandon if not.

6016 2018-01-10 16:50:20 Confusing.

Buffet call $crypto a bust. Not investing what he doesn't understand.

I've read 100s of books on Buffet. 

Rule#1 do not invest in what you don't know. 

Buffet has no idea, no willing to research - confident it will fail.

Something doesn't jive.

6022 2018-01-10 16:50:07 Start small! I put in around $150 in chunks of $25 - $50 over time, it's better to put something into crypto rather than nothing because you start making money almost right away, I know of a few good and consistent coins if you can't decide on what to buy 
6023 2018-01-10 16:50:01 I couldn’t be prouder to have invested in this crypto, I truly feel as if you’re on to something truly special with $KIN and I’m so happy to come along for what I’m sure will be a rollercoaster of a ride which only goes up!

6025 2018-01-10 16:49:58 @lukekovic the sage of Omaha wrong. Or is it the wrong question?The real value of crypto is underlying tech? Blockchain. Def let’s discuss when I’m in London.
6026 2018-01-10 16:49:46 For the first time I have sent some DGB to another wallet, fast and reliable transaction.The cheapest, fastest, longest and most secure UTXO blockchain. I truly believe $DGB is the future of crypto itself. Don't miss out on this revolutionary coin.

6044 2018-01-10 16:48:38 Market is littered the deciding factor for a price of a crypto currency Jesus Christ. The price of crypto currency is based on marketcap divided by circulating supply.

6070 2018-01-10 16:47:02 Utility for both is garbage.  Both are incapable of their intended purpose.  Greed of blockstream caused this.  Hard forking BTC was the most corrupt decision ever made in crypto.  BTC and BCH will both fail.

6088 2018-01-10 16:45:52 I didn’t! Still interested but I invested in crypto currency stuff instead.
6089 2018-01-10 16:45:52 So #cryptocurrency seems to be the talk of the town, what's everyone's tips and thoughts for 2018? #money #crypto #finance
6090 2018-01-10 16:45:44 Investing in Crypto is something which needs prior research and understanding. Sure, you will have a high ROI but in the quest for millions, we need to think 10 times before taking such a step. Crypto is not about the money but about the disruption. #Crypto #Blockchain
6091 2018-01-10 16:45:43 Here's to that, happening!
6092 2018-01-10 16:45:40 Do u have any source of info
6093 2018-01-10 16:45:33 Keeping up with the climbs and dips of crypto was not the headache I had anticipated for 2018
6094 2018-01-10 16:45:30 Looks like a red day for most of #crypto, good thing I've got errands and #PAXSouth prep to keep me busy!

6096 2018-01-10 16:45:07 @crypto_rand what about $lbc mate ?
6097 2018-01-10 16:45:05 can u tell exchange that coin is
6098 2018-01-10 16:44:55 Is it fair to relate crypto currency to people paying money for world of Warcraft gold? It's essentially the same thing but without a block chain right?

6114 2018-01-10 16:44:14 Warren Buffett's take on crypto is fascinating. On 1 hand u have most successful individual investor of past 50 years, but on the other u have an 87 year-old man who....
6115 2018-01-10 16:44:13 I love new crypto investors.

I have a friend who bought ETH at the peak yesterday. I said "dude why didnt you wait how is a 10 day bull run sustainable"

he said "w/e man im in it for the long run"

Fishes are coming in flocks people, stay strong!
6116 2018-01-10 16:44:08 Warren Buffett doesn't believe in crypto currencies.Thinks there's a bad ending. Or perhaps he fears he won't be able to leverage rich ppl?
6117 2018-01-10 16:44:04 Sürekli kulaklarımda çınlayan şu sözü de buraya bırakayım:
Ne ilk, ne son.. @mehmethamdibol
6118 2018-01-10 16:43:59 Ha! I think ultimately we're all in crypto for the profits, so I agree with taking profit where due. In my own opinion, I think the small day trader investors won't really matter once XRP starts getting more widely used by institutions, based on my own opinion & research. :)

6128 2018-01-10 16:43:31 Certainly, but opens an interesting paradox. How do crypto currencies interact with rebel groups, authoritarian leaders, and terrorist organizations? Interesting field of research emerging within Peace and Conflict Studies, poli sci, and history here

6138 2018-01-10 16:42:45 Would you want a crypto backed by an incompetent central bank? The people will buy decentralised crypto.
6139 2018-01-10 16:42:41 This is some shit quality FUD right here. Nice try though. You forget, however, that the crypto community isn't full of mouth breathers. We like math, we like science, we like facts. This sir, is none of those.
6140 2018-01-10 16:42:39 That would put the market cap closely around EOS, Tron, and Monero hovering just outside of the top 10.

6143 2018-01-10 16:42:20 Yes they do protect you once a bad actor becomes known to us - there was around ~20mins when ED wasn’t blacklisted whilst it was the hands of the attacker. 

It won’t protect you against willingly giving your private key away.

6178 2018-01-10 16:40:25 Pick Verge.  When the parasitic oligarchs who control the US figure out they can't compete with crypto's, they will make it illegal. The privacy coins will rule; mostly Monero. Verge is up there and a good and cheap competitor for now. Most upside is with Verge.

6207 2018-01-10 16:38:25 Honestly I find the buy/sell nature of crypto to be an illusion. It's completely failed to get picked up by edge-node retailers and performance suffers with scale. Kind of the opposite of what we'd hope to see with a tradable currency.
6208 2018-01-10 16:38:22 Watching runs in $DPW and $LEDS.  Crypto news could catapult  $DPW to a new high.

6211 2018-01-10 16:38:17 When I just started with crypto I was cautious and started with only small numbers (10 shares of NEO for example). Now I'm 5 months further I only want BIG numbers haha. Hundreds or thousands of shares. If you want to win big you have to play big 
6212 2018-01-10 16:38:15 I thought the whole point of decentralization was to make entities like the above mentioned redundant. I wonder where will the value come from a crypto-bank..
6213 2018-01-10 16:38:11 Absolutely right sir % there is no future of crypto currency , it's bullshit stay away, don't waste your real money for it please

6223 2018-01-10 16:37:35 Sorry but what is this BS? 
Why would u make me exchange it to that rate?
6224 2018-01-10 16:37:32 Very interesting. He says "bad ending" but I don't believe he actually means that there will be an actual end to crypto, just a bad correction. Glad to hear him say that he doesn't understand it all though. If he doesn't understand, how can he know it will go bad?
6225 2018-01-10 16:37:31 The tough days are where you see the most growth. This is true in everything. If you stick it through on the tough days, you will surely enjoy better ones. #crypto #hodl #gym #work #life
6226 2018-01-10 16:37:29 What’re your feelings on Crypto Currencies?
6227 2018-01-10 16:37:28 The first OG to follow me, I was a lonely nobody. You gave me my platform to shitpost and talk about my bitcoin love. Cheers mate, happy 100k!
6228 2018-01-10 16:37:26 I’m super excited about the future of distributed apps, blockchains and crypto, but my word, the asset speculation is nauseating
6229 2018-01-10 16:37:22 overnight para sa crypto no tulogan again 
6230 2018-01-10 16:37:22 The politest and most respectful thing to say here, is that his opinion on crypto probably isn't all that relevant.
6231 2018-01-10 16:37:14 $KODK sold my calls for a nice profit this morning. Could have had more but I slept in til 7:30. #crypto had me up all night. Flipped and went short with $7.5 puts. If we break $9.50, nothing but air for a good dollar. Right now above $10.

6237 2018-01-10 16:36:51 statement 1 : Crypto will end badly.
statement 2: I don't understand crypto so I won't invest.

6242 2018-01-10 16:36:40 It would be nice if decentralised blockchain solutions were going to be the future but the reality is different, assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum and others will get regulated.

6254 2018-01-10 16:35:52 That video of Amanda was a before and after for many people (I include myself). People who have been studying blockchain technology for several years. This video makes people open their minds and think more for themselves, and not be influenced by 'the mainstream'.

6257 2018-01-10 16:35:28 this is my concern, it pays off to be transparent and honest in crypto now, not the other way around!! they could be buying thier own island if the exchange was run right!!!

6263 2018-01-10 16:35:11 I'm obviously not going to change anybody's mind. I think amateur daytraders are the worst thing to happen to crypto so hopefully his move shook a lot of them out. my prediction for litecoin is that in 5 years, one of us will feel really dumb about this argument. hope its not me!

I thought the call will happen if the price drops to 1/3 of what it was. That would be around 30 cents - who could imagine it dropping so much when we are breaking ATH every day? But the minimum collateral is 1.75 and the call will happen at 52 cents. And here we are
6267 2018-01-10 16:34:56 technical understanding of cryptocurrencies is neither a requirement nor an advantage to being a good investor in them. Don't make this mistake as a technical person, crypto is extremely high risk and you should have at large share of money in less risky asset classes.
6268 2018-01-10 16:34:47 What about mining crypto? I thought I read somewhere that it was supposed to be reported on a schedule C as business income for its value on the date it was mined.
6269 2018-01-10 16:34:47 so glad twitter this block buttons so we can filter all you crypto faucet / gambling / gaming sites out the hashtags  fyi ppl make more money from creating your own faucet site and collecting ad-sense revenue from it than any and all existing "faucets" your welcome :)

6286 2018-01-10 16:33:41 Isn't it obvious and easy to say that? Most of my equity investor friends discard it as speculation without making an effort to understand it. Buffett can do better than that, it would have been nice of him had he talked more about the technology or the use cases of crypto.

6308 2018-01-10 16:32:30 Crypto inner mechanisms make it a completely new class of assets. Judging crypto based on stocks or fiat currencies is akin to judging a car from a stableman's perspective.

Your antivirus wouldn’t have blocked the domain due to a DNS change.  The “hacked” ED didn’t have any virus or malware on it - nothing to detect and block. 

It’s good you have antivirus but would not protect in this case.
6312 2018-01-10 16:32:24 No, I addressed your speculation in a previous tweet, I also probably hold more Ripple than you and bought in at under 30c, I wish to achieve organic growth not growth spread on baseless speculation. You think banks will want to touch anything with this much volatility?

6317 2018-01-10 16:31:51 Thank you. Well said. I suppose it's always been like this. I remember when mentioning crypto was taboo around some. Now they call me for help.
6318 2018-01-10 16:31:50 Dat klopt Pascal. #sixeleven is  niet een uitgesproken project waar ik direct warm voor loop.

6324 2018-01-10 16:31:18 Maybe next time interview a real blockchain expert not a sleazy traveling YouTube entertainer who happens to also be a crypto enthusiast (who probably reached out in order to pump his own bags).

6359 2018-01-10 16:29:44 The FuD created everytime the market goes through a healthy correction makes me sick.Bankers and government will not stop crypto currencies because they simply CAN’T.They trying out with regulation and close down the exchanges?

6368 2018-01-10 16:28:57 Investing/Speculating is a zero-sum game. On balance, as much profit as loss is made. Many people made fortunes in #crypto. If you haven't (partially) cashed out yet, that is your money they're having.

#blockchain #cryptos #altcoins #bitcoin
6369 2018-01-10 16:28:53 When do you talk about the $ZCL / $BTCP fork?
6370 2018-01-10 16:28:48 An investor is somebody with a long term vision. As you know some cc wil rise to the roof. And i will made millions just for doing nothing.
6371 2018-01-10 16:28:48 Baseless predictions. Still havnt seen a US bank even get close to Ripple. Keep dreaming.
6372 2018-01-10 16:28:45 Woke up to RED all over the market... not even worried
6373 2018-01-10 16:28:43 Due to high demands of crypto currency. My graphics card is now selling for more than double the price. Spent 375. Saw it on eBay for 950. Im ready to cash in.

6383 2018-01-10 16:28:16 Naja als je niet wild enthousiast was over een coin zoals je zei dan leek dit wel een kleine gok om deze coin te kopen . Maar je hebt nu al een mooi resultaat chapeau
6384 2018-01-10 16:28:15 Does Warren Buffett deal in crypto currencies? I wonder how objective he can be...every dime invested in cryptocurrency is a dime he’s not making any money on...interesting

6392 2018-01-10 16:27:41 There's one irrefutable truth about the new crypto economy: It's spawned more freshly minted yet supremely-confident financial experts than it has ICOs.

6399 2018-01-10 16:27:07 No he didnt, thats sidechains hes talking about. You seem very misinformed. 2nd layer is LN, its being developed independently by multiple dev groups. Go read up a bit more fam.
6400 2018-01-10 16:27:06 I hope it goes to that price...


6401 2018-01-10 16:27:06 oh ok. Wanted to see how best i could tap from yor vast knowledge of crypto trading
6402 2018-01-10 16:27:05 I really can’t answer that as I’m not 100% sure. I doubt it was as much as we have now only because nobody really knew about it. Now that it’s taking over the world and there is new coins everyday I don’t foresee this volatility slowing down.
6403 2018-01-10 16:26:58 I will bet you 1Btc that XRP tokens will not even be $25 by mid 2019? Quote me on that
6404 2018-01-10 16:26:55 Will you delete your account when XRP is worth zilch?
6405 2018-01-10 16:26:45 That compan @Kodak used to be one of the biggest companies in the world. Just because they failed to adapt when things went digital doesnt mean they are crap. I actually love that they dont make another blunder like before and are looking to thr future in #crypto. Way to go Kodak
6406 2018-01-10 16:26:43 Im going to netherlands in a few days, my plan is to try to dont use fiat/euro. Is netherlands/amsterdam a $crypto friendly place?? Any recommendation? $btc
6407 2018-01-10 16:26:42 @MichaelSuppo Could you please do a video on crypto tax? I have been to 3 accountants in the UK and none of them are willing to even take me on and could not advise on what to do. What is the most tax efficient way to be set up? It is stopping me from starting crypto altogether!

6410 2018-01-10 16:26:20 Note to self: Remember not to overtrade. The past 24 hours in an attempt to optimize trades it seems I managed to mess up a few of my positions a little which I then had to repair by buying in a little higher. Overtrading is bad. $BTC #bitcoin $crypto

6416 2018-01-10 16:25:51 One trick I use to predict Bitcoin’s next move is to watch the leveraged trades on @whalecalls and @BitmexRekt.

“Liquidated long” = Bearish signal

6422 2018-01-10 16:25:31 No, not at all crazy. I agree. Curious, how long have you been invested in this crypto?
6423 2018-01-10 16:25:27 This means, he is investing in crypto. He is trying to get prices down so that he can buy at the cheapest... I bet in a few months he will say, I'm sorry, I was wrong ;-)
6424 2018-01-10 16:25:21 Most of my crypto investments rn are long term. I’ll check back in a good 6-12 months
6425 2018-01-10 16:25:21 told u so...... if you didnt had wtc and just bought coins you could make like 200% a month on your money and wc keep stuck from 5-15 usd long time....

6431 2018-01-10 16:24:40 A lot of people here think we have hit peak crypto / ICO - but when we look back I think Telegram's ICO, that will likely do very well and raise hundreds of millions of dollars, will be the impetus to a floodgate of more established companies doing so.
6432 2018-01-10 16:24:33 Inventing own crypto these days be like "We are self declared billionaires" :P

6435 2018-01-10 16:24:26 We could all learn a great deal from this man on many levels. Crypto is so new that history has little it can teach us aside from a lesson in gravity. Old way wall st. wisdom has zero use in today's new world. Sorry old timer, swing and a miss here.

6443 2018-01-10 16:23:47 If your in ripple you should just get out of crypto all together... We want to kill the bank beast not feed it!

6445 2018-01-10 16:23:29 Couldn’t agree more. The project promises to bring Crypto currency to the masses. Like PayPal & Apple Pay rolled into one. 
Brilliant concept, which is close to fruition.

6447 2018-01-10 16:23:19 Daily #TradingStrategy Tip: It’s always best to trade with a crypto or penny stock that has Stochastic Oscillations which are both non-repetitive and non-varied.

6456 2018-01-10 16:22:38 Haha. Saw what it did to kodak. Unbelievable crypto madness.
6457 2018-01-10 16:22:34 Do you know if #BTC or #ETH experienced similar volatility in its early early days? My knowledge about the trends of the coins don't go that far back.
6458 2018-01-10 16:22:27 Thank you for your insights. I also follow those of @Haejin_Crypto He provides alternate paths as well since there are many depending on timeframe. Most appear bullish. I hope they confirm.
6459 2018-01-10 16:22:24 Let the rate get back down to $1.00-$1.50 first lol

6464 2018-01-10 16:21:41 Let’s not forget your wealth in crypto is because new people entered the space. Everyone so quick to call out “noobs” for entering but when FOMO hits and BTC or other coins grow most of you are pretty excited, don’t lie
6465 2018-01-10 16:21:40 Add btc buddy
6466 2018-01-10 16:21:28 Wow dude, XRP will never reach 100$.
Too many supply. To reach this goal they should burn half of current supply.
6467 2018-01-10 16:21:27 Agree.. “shit coins” or “Freud coins” do not get big name investors as they don’t want the company they built to be tied to something like that. Everyone who invested $200 thinks they should have 2 million dollars in a few hours. Even BTC millionaires had to wait years! Lol.

6486 2018-01-10 16:20:34 Can you answer my questions about $TRX though?  

Like the economic model and about the white paper?

What exactly did you find in your research that lead you wanting to invest?

Why are you ignoring these questions?
6487 2018-01-10 16:20:32 I hope you can ride this out before it rises again. Margin trading is risky imo, these crypto markets are still very immature and irrational. I prefer to buy and hold when possible. Just my 2 cents.

6522 2018-01-10 16:18:08 My friend I am seeing all this from months 95% of charts are just shit..!! And Crypto never grows or corrects as per charts..!!
6523 2018-01-10 16:18:03 But that's the thing, he fully and earnestly admits that he doesn't understand it at all, and can't imagine he ever will, and that's why he won't invest. He did say emphatically that he never had and never would short any crypto a dime. Personally I respected his answer.

そのために2ちゃんで叩かれてもクソリプきても一切動じないくらいのメンタルが必要だよね。

6540 2018-01-10 16:17:00 if you're upset about the misuse of crypto to mean cryptocurrency instead of cryptography, where was your outrage over the misuse of hacker? or virus? or rootkit? or anti-virus?

6550 2018-01-10 16:16:26 You're probably just below 3x right now, so again you have little to worry about. If you think the price of BTS will continue to fall then I suggest you find a way to pay down the loan. Do you have any other coins to sell?
6551 2018-01-10 16:16:17 Good to see markets rebounding further portfolio was down more than 20% now in single digit  #crypto $XVG $TRX $XRP $BTC
6552 2018-01-10 16:16:07 Great news. This tells me #blockchain and #Crypto are on to something. A peasants revolution that must be destroyed by the institutions and elites who designed a system that works for them and enslaves us by their rules. Typical Buffet . If you cant own it . Destroy it. #BTC
6553 2018-01-10 16:16:05 I have little faith in them. If their infrastructure is so fragile that they can't process an outbound crypto transaction in less than 5 days, then their payment model is inherently flawed.

6569 2018-01-10 16:15:18 Fiat will become less and less attracting in the future. You may be very wise regarding the usual stockexchanges....my humble opinion - Crypto is here to stay..

6574 2018-01-10 16:14:53 he eventually moved to talking about how rich he was going to get with crypto currency and I was like, "alright, good luck, just get me to the airport."
6575 2018-01-10 16:14:44 There's some truth to this. While this statement actual applies to all crypto currently, it is especially true with BTC as there is less value of it being used in transactions because of how utterly inefficient it is.
6576 2018-01-10 16:14:40 $XCP made my last two days beautiful. 
cashed out part of profit 3 days ago and buying back last hours makes me even richer.
6577 2018-01-10 16:14:37 The whole market is a little funky right now. Since $trx has massive potential, your question isn't really whether or not to cut loose from #tron, it is whether or not #crypto is for you in the first place. Does that make sense?
6578 2018-01-10 16:14:34 When will we see the market in the green again? #Xrp #btc #eth #bch #ltc #neo #xvg #trx #cryptocurrency #Crypto

6580 2018-01-10 16:14:29 In #crypto it’s hard to take baby boomers opinions seriously. Crypto is a millennial game. And the millennial’s are going to say how this ends. This is coming from a gen xer.
6581 2018-01-10 16:14:28 Is it too late to enter?

Nee. Hooguit omdat meer mensen erin geloven.

6586 2018-01-10 16:14:17 Do not confuse crypto currency exchange and #stockexchange. They are not the same. Expect #cryptocurrency to swallow the stock market along it's path to becoming a #decentralized #globaleconomy. YW.

6592 2018-01-10 16:14:15 Endorsing crypto is bad for reputation lol
6593 2018-01-10 16:14:15 Thats like all those people saying " If marijuana is legalised its going to end bad" Colorado Washington seem to be doing fine. Warren learn more about crypto and blockchain your companies will benefit from them
6594 2018-01-10 16:14:14 Crypto assets are both overvalued & undervalued. The 2-3 winners are significantly undervalued. The other 99.9% are massively overvalued.
6595 2018-01-10 16:14:13 Congrats! When's a low cap cryptotwitter like me gonna get my moon :(
6596 2018-01-10 16:14:13 Instead of flipping pack invest ur bread into stock in 2018. GE, GoPro, and Ford expected to rise the most this first quarter. Also research crypto currencies.
6597 2018-01-10 16:14:11 We value your work. Keep being awesome!
6598 2018-01-10 16:14:10 I think 300-400 sats is an realistic price for XVG and 5000 sats for TRX, but maybe i’m totally wrong. I Can’t look in the future but TRX is not a simple coin but a real revolution, XVG is not bad but overprized at the moment in my opinion.

6601 2018-01-10 16:13:53 And they got caught in the cross fire I guess. BTC and most Alts are price correlated nowadays !  I guess, this will all end soon (2-5 days I think)

6615 2018-01-10 16:12:54 I 100% agree with you and totally disagree with people thinking this is a fraud or shitcoin. Too much at stake for too many big timers for it to be a fraud IMO. I guess the age of 24/7 trading and ups and downs has made us #altcoin investors just a tad bit impatient ah?
6616 2018-01-10 16:12:52 yeah I backed out when I noticed it going down lol life as a day trader

6620 2018-01-10 16:12:39 What in the holy hell are you on about?
Encryption has been around since long before computers. There is no conceivable way of doing an "ethical review" of any kind of tech itself (possibly of its applications), and previous attempts to criminalise crypto were disasters.

6642 2018-01-10 16:11:27 How full is full?
6643 2018-01-10 16:11:26 Funny to see how tweets with popular crypto currency tags as $btc, $eth, $xrp and so on outperform regular crypto tweets in statistics so well.
6644 2018-01-10 16:11:20 why did it get delisted off bittrex. just curious

6648 2018-01-10 16:11:07 Yea with my 3 followers lol. I like to think i am a nice guy. Im just in it for the conversation. If you havent realized this guy is a scam artist you know nothing about crypto.
6649 2018-01-10 16:11:01 so how long do I have to #HODL? I have 50,000 #TRX by the way. 
6650 2018-01-10 16:10:58 Correct!

6652 2018-01-10 16:10:58 Again I’m not here to get anyone to invest in anything. I could be 1000% wrong. But think if you owned a 8 billion dollar company would you invest in something you didn’t think would work??  the answer is you would make sure it works

6670 2018-01-10 16:10:08 kODAK PLANS TO LAUNCH A KODAKOIN I CAN NOT EVEN IMAGINE THE BATTLES FOR THIS ICO. Their stock surge! I will be so happy to see those dudes that said that bitcoin and crypto economy is a bubble cry after more companies start to solve their problems with blockchain. @MichaelSuppo

6678 2018-01-10 16:09:48 He also stated he does not know anything about the crypto world. If he is not interested in doing actual research then his opinion should not be valid. Its stated in the article. @WarrenBuffett
6679 2018-01-10 16:09:48 Might go the same way for #Ethereum since it was pumped in a CNBC interview with founder two days ago. Not selling my #Altcoins for #ETH at these levels. Am I wrong? #crypto #cryptocurrency #spelunking

6682 2018-01-10 16:09:35 Why are there no options markets for crypto?
6683 2018-01-10 16:09:33 Lol look at the market cap.. Netflix is 91b+ and Baofeng is barely above 1b.... @justinsuntron never over hype man, you hurt investors this way when you pump and dump your coin... let it grow naturally and show us the S&P500
6684 2018-01-10 16:09:33 Not really theses guys pumped the whole market, you can hate those coins but they did help allot.
6685 2018-01-10 16:09:25 
6686 2018-01-10 16:09:25 Altcoins are over my friends. It's time to get out
6687 2018-01-10 16:09:14 Clients keep asking “I know a lot of people have a made a lot of money in Bitcoin, is it too late to get in” my response is ~ it might be too early! This is just the beginning of a very different world!
6688 2018-01-10 16:09:07 $proc on the move higher again.. Should see a similar run like yday, and eclipse its high. BUY @Cryptopia_NZ @OTC_Bitcoin @ProCommerceInfo @procurrency_ @whalecalls

Not sitting pretty after all
6692 2018-01-10 16:08:49 He's buying cripto like a horse!!!
6693 2018-01-10 16:08:49 アカウント売ったんですかね〜〜

6695 2018-01-10 16:08:47 #crypto is 80billion higher than 10 hours ago, but everything is still red.

Where's the 80 billion going?
6696 2018-01-10 16:08:46 Tip: If you live off of your crypto gains, then keep enough cash for living expenses; there are dry spells. Some of the bigger swing trades take time. Traders tend to regret selling from their positions, which needed more time to develop. Best to have another stream of cashflow
6697 2018-01-10 16:08:43 a lot people say same but he still down.
6698 2018-01-10 16:08:40 Working class hero by day, crypto anti-superhero by night. Eller natt å natt. Jag har ju barn för fan. Går och lägger mig 20:00. Men mellan fem och åtta gör jag några av de sämsta crypto traderna known to mankind

6701 2018-01-10 16:08:28 
Crypto Isn’t so healthy haha. 

Btw Would you prefer ADA or XLM ??
6702 2018-01-10 16:08:27 And a seasoned technical analyst too....never seen so many charts?!
6703 2018-01-10 16:08:21 This bad boy gonna hit 8 dollars by June
6704 2018-01-10 16:08:10 It was for a single person so there wasn’t any context.  It’s just the bizarre world of crypto currency trading vs traditional currency trading.
6705 2018-01-10 16:08:09 Rather than VC funding, startups should release their own brand of crypto coin
6706 2018-01-10 16:08:09 やっぱりあかがみさん中身変わったぽいよねww
6707 2018-01-10 16:08:02 @KodakBlack1k they made a crypto with your name on it bro. KODAK COIN. You're on the blockchain now
6708 2018-01-10 16:07:57 The time when investor and market sentiment is very low, is often a signal that we are or nearing the best time to buy, especially in $crypto where the streets are full of ignorance and sentiment is much more sensitive. #Crypto #cryptocurrency
6709 2018-01-10 16:07:57 Quit spreading ur fucking FUD. Look what XRP has done n look what XVG has done? XVG is way behind.. that said we’re all in this crypto game together there’s enough room for a lot more no need to bash other coins. Have some class.
6710 2018-01-10 16:07:56 $QQQ straight up with all the major crypto moving here... bit odd.
6711 2018-01-10 16:07:56 Lol
6712 2018-01-10 16:07:52 When do you predict a $100 xrp?
6713 2018-01-10 16:07:49 Fingers crossed for that.
6714 2018-01-10 16:07:46 @szul I hear you've been doing some crypto stuff.
6715 2018-01-10 16:07:45 oh yeah because brexit was a success right? Lol
6716 2018-01-10 16:07:41 I haven't sold not even 1 $bnty yet. There is no target price but target event. Until a competitor emerges.
6717 2018-01-10 16:07:39 It's way too over powered for the kind of games I play. Crypto mining had fucked up the prices of mid range cards, so picking the best available card makes sense right now. At least that's what I'm telling myself. 
6718 2018-01-10 16:07:34 How much you want to bet that if he hits me back he’ll try and shame me for being a poor musician(?) That Crypto Currency is a Helluva Drug!
6719 2018-01-10 16:07:32 lol
6720 2018-01-10 16:07:31 I agree. They missed BTC...missed ETH...missed LTC...missed Ripple. Everyone knows how much it pisses the 1% off that all that crypto money is going into someone else's pocket except their own
6721 2018-01-10 16:07:26 Yeah because this never happens in crypto... 
6722 2018-01-10 16:07:21 New innovations always seem weird at first... *little people taking inside of a box*  tv!  #Staysavy
6723 2018-01-10 16:07:19 People are buying #Vibe for a lot of #btc without knowing what the fuck it is. Will buy this shit at 5000 sats maximum. #binance #crypto
6724 2018-01-10 16:07:17 Railblocks is a better investment! #XRB
6725 2018-01-10 16:07:13 Absolutely love your reviews, thank you for doing what you are doing :)
6726 2018-01-10 16:07:11 What's a put?
6727 2018-01-10 16:07:10 @novogratz has also started talks about a crypto central banking system. How is this a bubble if a single person is willing to invest his entire fund into making a new banking system.
6728 2018-01-10 16:07:10 Love this  what's your fave place for quick lessons? Where should I be reading or watching?
6729 2018-01-10 16:07:09 Lol an OC client feels as if this all is a bubble and only speculation. Cant wait till either I or some other client comes down to buy either his home or an adjacent property with crypto/btc
6730 2018-01-10 16:07:07 The fact that nearly everyone values #crypto currencies in dollars tells you something about what and people consider money, and what they don't consider money
6731 2018-01-10 16:06:58 MAXM completely gone from $SGLA. Told y’all it was just a prop ask to buy more shares. No selling, crypto merger, hit .07 last week. More news coming soon via most recent PR.
6732 2018-01-10 16:06:57 Such a shame, if you would ask around in public, many'll know Bitcoin and only a few'll know Ethereum (or Ripple) while Ethereum is a much better project if you ask me. Bitcoin has a lot of brand value, that's pretty much it. #Crypto #Blockchain #Bitcoin #Ethereum

6733 2018-01-10 16:06:53 you realize we were also in Forbes and Bloomberg right?

6737 2018-01-10 16:06:46 The crypto industry has solved the global unemployment problem. Now Now, anyone can be a full time crypto trader! 
6738 2018-01-10 16:06:43 I hope someone purchases the NFL with crypto currency and converts it into the world's largest Datsun dealership.
6739 2018-01-10 16:06:38 Ripple hype and speculation could drive the price as high as $10 IMO. Ripple is getting into risky territory. There are plenty of other alts with high growth potential. Follow my account for free alerts.
6740 2018-01-10 16:06:37 年末ジャンボ気分で少量買って忘れてたMTHさんの上げだけが心の救い笑

6741 2018-01-10 16:06:36 Over 200 crypto hedge funds started in the last nine days. #Wow @stachicago #emergingtechpanel
6742 2018-01-10 16:06:35 I didn't buy anything at the very top but at a minus 30%, keeps on dipping but one should hold 
6743 2018-01-10 16:06:24 The Asian markets are very intelligent people. They knew there would be a sell off so why should they pump the price to make the American market a profit? You will see tonight when they pump this price up.
6744 2018-01-10 16:06:22 First to hit $50 in value! Lets spike them prices up! If other comment!

6745 2018-01-10 16:06:18 There’s also clear collusion by flippers to scare people into selling, driving price down so they can collect more and more!
6746 2018-01-10 16:06:18 He is saying this because crypto is taking away from any appeal Forex had. No one wants to trade fiat currencies which not backed by anything and printed to oblivion. Also, your odds at being successful in Forex are close to none. It's all AI.  Bitcoin will slaughter Forex.
6747 2018-01-10 16:06:17 Nah crypto community is actually fuckin funny
6748 2018-01-10 16:06:17 @sulrah
6749 2018-01-10 16:06:15 Check volumes guys
6750 2018-01-10 16:06:14 $1000 swing in the past hour. If you have a weak ass heart or anxiety about losing money, #crypto is not your option. So if you aren't going to be playing, better sit back and give the pros their space. #btc #ltc #litecoin #watchin'sticksandbuyingdips
6751 2018-01-10 16:06:08 I really don't get why people panic and FUD so much in #crypto. We had an awesome start in 2018, what's so wrong about a little dip? #BTFD
6752 2018-01-10 16:06:07 Crypto currency is going to cause a major boom just like the dot com era. i can see Kodak going under before 2018 ends. which is a shame, because they rocked when i was a kid. my Polaroid was created by them
6753 2018-01-10 16:06:05 Çünkü hocam bunlar süper çalışan bisey yapsa bile dünyada huskelle yazan kim varki bunu update etsin dapp lar yazsın. Eth tam tersi en popüler dilleri basitleştirip solidity cikardi. Eth den iyileri de var tabi. Eth bir lider.
6754 2018-01-10 16:06:04 Crypto makes me laugh...and cry, what a ride. Still in for the long hold on $XRP #XRP Still up 
6755 2018-01-10 16:06:03 Not really. "Crypto" is a variety of disruptive tech that serve different functions in the new world. @Ripple wants to act as liquidity between financial institutions. If ordinary people want to buy in they should understand that risk, but it does not defeat the spirit of crypto
6756 2018-01-10 16:06:01 なんでリップル220円で売れるのに400円のときに売れないの？
欲出しすぎてるからだよー
今リップル250円でまた買い直すの？
6757 2018-01-10 16:05:54 Invested in $VEN few weeks ago. That's only start - think about its potnetial...

6758 2018-01-10 16:05:53 Been telling every crypto person I know to buy $wtc, if you couldn’t tell by the name. Just going to keep methodically working it’s way up. Until one day it goes boom. God forbid they start marketing this thing 
6759 2018-01-10 16:05:49 Totally agree. GPA rates you on your ability to get a good GPA -- but now try and get a 4.0 college grad to tell you how to do your crypto taxes LOL
6760 2018-01-10 16:05:48 Our team has another big day in #NYC! Interview with @TechRepublic coming soon! #crypto #blockchain #fintech #tech #technews
6761 2018-01-10 16:05:47 That and I've got some $POE bags too. But i got a lot of it at 300, so i'm fairly ok still ... They're quietly working right now. You have to decide whether you want to day trade or HODL. In the end HODLing works 99% of the time. You just need patience. It's tough but true.

6767 2018-01-10 16:05:36 I've been asking my company if I can just pull all of it out and invest on my own. These returns are pathetic. I could do some real damage in crypto with more firepower 
6768 2018-01-10 16:05:30 @WarrenBuffett i bet my $1k does better in crypto next 5 years than your $1k mr. buffet. no disrespect, but money up! #cryptobuffetchallenge #ethereum #bitcoin @NeerajKA 
6769 2018-01-10 16:05:30 DO SOME FUCKING RESEARCH!!! Jesus christ! I’ve been a bagholder of xvg for a long time now, people said you are a douche and a fraud i still held, thinking tou are one seeing the bigger picture in crypto. Obviously not if you spread fud that has been debunked a billion times

6773 2018-01-10 16:05:28 I am reading your feed the whole day, but I don't seem to get it. What does it all mean? Do we panic sell? Brace for impact? Roll over and play dead? Rejoice? Woohoo? Buy the dip? Sell the tip?
6774 2018-01-10 16:05:23 Risky shit. Only good if you want to day trade it for small profits between waves. I don't do that anymore, waste of time in crypto

6782 2018-01-10 16:05:09 True. But I talked to my grandpa who understands money. We went all through the history of money agreeing - even to complaining about the fed together- until we got to crypto. Then he was like "well that's not money."

It's frustrating for sure.
6783 2018-01-10 16:05:08 Know of any other ICOs of interest out there? I missed SwissBorg by a day 
6784 2018-01-10 16:04:56 Yes master
6785 2018-01-10 16:04:56 the beauty of crypto is that it forces a paradigm shift that most people aren't willing to make, even smart investors like Warren Buffet. Of course he wouldn't like it, it transfers wealth and power AWAY from him lol.
6786 2018-01-10 16:04:54 What happens when it's the end of that BTC cycle? Does the whole cryptocurrency market shrink and all coins bleed no matter what?
6787 2018-01-10 16:04:48 I would guess a majority of the sell off was from the American market. I only hold few #TRX and I’m invested big in #XRP. Other markets will see how big this is once all the Asian markets start buying in the millions. I’m not trying to pump up anything. This is just an opinion.
6788 2018-01-10 16:04:44 They would say that about crypto. Because it's based on trust and not earnings. Pretty much like all currencies.

6791 2018-01-10 16:04:35 Crucial is go live of pilot/beta products in 2018. 

If 1 or 2 could be succesful, this could be in favour of the crypto.
6792 2018-01-10 16:04:35 North Korea out here a both a (a) nuclear threat to humanity & (b) a threat to crypto currency markets due to their relentless assault on South Korean exchanges. Smh. Someone come get they mans. They out here raining on everyone's parade
6793 2018-01-10 16:04:34 When I bought shares of Zenith bank, I had no "domain knowledge" of what it was and how valuable it would be or not. That's equities, a relatively old field, talk more of Crypto which is an unknown terrain for almost everyone.
6794 2018-01-10 16:04:34 Cryptostudent, sell your $100 worth of coins and get out. Take your impatience somewhere else. This is a long term hold and if you don't understand that you did zero research
6795 2018-01-10 16:04:22 Warren Buffet needs to go take a nap and let the youngins handle this.
6796 2018-01-10 16:04:14 #crypto market apps!
6797 2018-01-10 16:04:13 Ripple could go as high as $10, but that is a stretch and getting into very risky territory. Tread carefully everyone!

6800 2018-01-10 16:03:52 Taking everything I learned from @NicTrades FB strategy group and from her early morning #crypto video meeting, she PERFECTLY described an entry into #XRP and #XLM for me this morning so I could make a quick profitable swing trade! WOOT, thanks!
6801 2018-01-10 16:03:48 You couldn’t be more wrong. This network is growing. #bitcoin and the crypto space isn’t even close to capturing its full potential. But please stay away and keep justifying to yourself over and over that it’s over valued. Buy buy.

6805 2018-01-10 16:03:36 An interesting stat to see would be which coins have fallen from their ATH the most over a 7 day period like the one we just experienced.  Ripple down to $1.88.  ATH was $3.84.  Would this be a better buy than something the only fell half as much (among those in the top 50)?
6806 2018-01-10 16:03:32 Please higher we go
6807 2018-01-10 16:03:28 So, the infrastructure is very insufficient to make crypto be used for finance/payments/ contracts etc.

6814 2018-01-10 16:03:05 CES 2018: Crypto Enthusiasts Symposium 

Amazing hardware breakthroughs happening here and all the chatter is on crypto...

6815 2018-01-10 16:02:55 #RT @CryptoTraders: RT @davidgokhshtein: $DFS gets a SB-ST (1-6M) - spoke to the crew. Definitely knowledgeable and know exactly what they are doing. #crypto #cryptocurrency #cryptonews #cryptowiz
6816 2018-01-10 16:02:46 $KODK, $HMNY, $AMRH, and $COGT all blockchain crypto news plays. Hopefully no retail bought the opening candle. All of them sold hard at open. Know what you're trading. P ump n dumps
6817 2018-01-10 16:02:45 So the further we go, the more it all will depend on institutions. Another risk is just that fundamentally, crypto industry is doing terrible. Scaling problems are severe and the chance bitcoin had at making crypto truly global and decentralized failed.
6818 2018-01-10 16:02:43 I got in early too, still 8x my investment with current price. But I think it’s a good crypto.
6819 2018-01-10 16:02:41 When the price was cheap enough for some people to buy hundreds of millions, it’s gonna take time at each level to form a new base. Relax!
6820 2018-01-10 16:02:37 Yea he asked him to stop but he decided not to so he got choked up. He caused it for himself
6821 2018-01-10 16:02:36 Yes, I was in communication with Kent over there now I can’t seem to get a hold of him

6822 2018-01-10 16:02:35 Even recognizing that there's an inherent conflict is already a step up. Usually those discussions get stuck on the level of "crypto is a really shitty means of exchange!" "No it's not!" "Yes it is!" etc.
6823 2018-01-10 16:02:27 We gonna show the world what Crypto really is.....Excellent Job Dev team..... Perfect Community Members...,....I'm loving this

6829 2018-01-10 16:02:19 Too much crypto would do this to you...
6830 2018-01-10 16:02:16 what $SGMO no crypto stock ?
6831 2018-01-10 16:02:15 people literally plan their lives on this man, he's probably right but crypto isn't likely going to fall with in the next fives years so I'm ok with this lol

6836 2018-01-10 16:02:01 Good for you. Start pushing good companies and coins. Not this trash, please.
6837 2018-01-10 16:01:56 株式も100単元じゃなくて1単元にした方がいいと思うけれどどうなんだろ？
例えばディズニーの株式ほしい人は大勢いるけれど100単元では買えない。でも5単元くらいなら学生でも買える。
結果的に時価総額は増えると思うのだが意味ないのだろうか？
6838 2018-01-10 16:01:48 As it's finally cold in LA I can't help but think my heater would be so much more useful if it was helping to cure cancer, find aliens, or mine crypto currency
6839 2018-01-10 16:01:44 The partnership was announced at 4pm China time and there was only a minor spike and it trended downward quickly after. Don't get me wrong, I'm all in on #TRON, I'm just trying to question and understand..

6842 2018-01-10 16:01:32 If ripple doubles again it will exceed bitcoins market cap. Not to mention Chris Larson could be the richest man in the world. Novogratz expressed concern on this possible bubble. I do not know if you projections are justified. Ripple does have a lot of publicity hype though.
6843 2018-01-10 16:01:32 Var ju tvungen att få igång diskussion på något sätt. Är helt tyst när man skriver om crypto. 5000 visningar och 2000 media engagemang och 1 like och 0 kommentarer. Ingen vågar fronta sin åsikt. 
6844 2018-01-10 16:01:29 I think it's more 5250. Idk. I just started learning TA. Much better at judging T and A.
6845 2018-01-10 16:01:25 Following a volume analysis I could tell you that investors are scared and try to get benefits to invest on high value coins. Volume of selling of trx is low compare to volume of potential buyers... just a tip #trx #tron #tron #trx $trx #Coinbase #binance #signals

6851 2018-01-10 16:01:09 Secondly, Crypto started with dumb small money moving in 1st and institutions following, but once the last dumb folks from the public go all in, we will run out of money, so institutions will have to join for the ponzi to continue. But insitutional money is regulated money
6852 2018-01-10 16:01:08 Still don’t understand those investors  in innovation that don’t bet on crypto currencies. Truth is new disruptive tech solutions either they go mainstream or evolve in something bigger. I guess they still don’t understand crypto currencies are here to stay.
6853 2018-01-10 16:01:07 Heck yeah pretty small !! this currency has big potential !

6858 2018-01-10 16:00:50 Crypto insiders know many crypoassets are shit. They know herd behaviour is driving current investment patterns. 

It's probably 1999 again. 

My point is: no one is sure of anything. Not enthusiasts not naysayers

If he was that omniscient he would have invested in tech unicorns
6859 2018-01-10 16:00:48 As much as I would love to stay at home & keep up with crypto, it’s back to the basics 
6860 2018-01-10 16:00:45 The crypto trading community is still really new and amateur. Crypto is full of "mindless" traders, with very weak hands. This is a very new technology, so this is not surprising. People don't really look at the technical side of the given Cryptocurrency.

6869 2018-01-10 16:00:28 True, in that case I dont even call it as true crypto currency. It is just another faster transaction model built on blockchain. May be SWIFT technology replacement model

6871 2018-01-10 16:00:27 The reality is that there are many risks in crypto. While I would say I do not see any big risks within 1 year, I think that regulation could impact markets a lot.

6972 2018-01-10 15:55:06 A #cryptocurrency needs to be able to handle a practical side to fulfil a role as money. In particular, it needs to achieve the scale required to handle huge numbers of transactions. This is something that many newer #cryptocurrencies have tried to address.

7019 2018-01-10 15:52:43 The crazy gold rush also attracts people from other industries into crypto and gives  more funding and attention to new projects.

7069 2018-01-10 15:50:04 Of course, it's annoying that some exchanges closed their doors for new users and others are slow due to high traffic but look at the bigger picture and you know this is a good sign.

7071 2018-01-10 15:49:59 Exodus does look nice but has too limited a selection of coins. Also the high transaction fees Shafeshift charges made actual trade between wallets unprofitable. Gotta love the coin dropping sound though. I've all assets back onto exchanges. Maybe unwisely.
7072 2018-01-10 15:49:52 Hey @udemy! @Neutron_Crypto is the first decentralized education platform hosted on the blockchain  and we would like to set up a meeting to discuss potential  opportunities.
7073 2018-01-10 15:49:49 Not creating anything and only consuming is like the definition of a crypto trader lol. 

I think it's a fair thing to bring up, especially if "market cap" is fair game like everyone seems to think. Best practice a combination of things though so I get what you're saying.
7074 2018-01-10 15:49:46 thx dude
7075 2018-01-10 15:49:35 The time has come
7076 2018-01-10 15:49:32 Only dropped because coinmarketcap took out $50B which made it look like a massive dump and that caused panic selling, which is why every crypto is suffering
7077 2018-01-10 15:49:31 It’s going to be a slow crawl, but the IRS will make sure they pay for the record year in 2017. Coinbase essentially eliminates a lot of the anonymity now. A lot of unsophisticated investors (crypto traders) may not even be aware of this.

However it doesn't take away from the main argument that the "hubs" that "open channels" will become subject to govt regulation and thus centralize $BTC.

This is why $BCH is the real Bitcoin.

7101 2018-01-10 15:48:06 Up 4 sure
7102 2018-01-10 15:48:04 There’s going to be a lot more crypto kitties and virtual good examples coming out this year
7103 2018-01-10 15:48:03 @MichaelSuppo @Crypto_Daily @boxmining - Just loved this #topgear concept! Do this more!
7104 2018-01-10 15:48:01 Buffett on crypto currencies:   "We'll never own a position in them," #cryptos
7105 2018-01-10 15:48:00 具体的な金額の話とかいかにもなポジトークは好きじゃないので避けてたけれど、ほんとにもう適正価格の予想がつかない。
「暗号通貨ではなく銀行市場を狙っている」という言葉通り、バンキングネットワークの「システム」の構築が進んでいっている。
ちょっと現実離れしてて理解が追いつかない。
7106 2018-01-10 15:47:55 You forgot to mention the name of the crypto that will achieve this.... #EOS
7107 2018-01-10 15:47:51 Bao feng is a great partnership it’s just you’ll never make people happy they Alwaies want more
7108 2018-01-10 15:47:47 Did you see how Buffett said he will never invest in crypto currencies?
7109 2018-01-10 15:47:47 I tell you #crypto players every time in an #altcoin dip... there HAS to be a new floor before a new ceiling!!! Corrections are happening ever 10-15 days and last a couple of days. Beeeeee patient!!!!! 
#BAYNA #coolhandLuke
7110 2018-01-10 15:47:44 This is a head and shoulder formation.... I was taught this is bearish... Formation
7111 2018-01-10 15:47:41 The uptrend of course!
7112 2018-01-10 15:47:32 We're all wrong about crypto - just to varying degrees.
7113 2018-01-10 15:47:28 Because people keep speculating ali baba so whenever it isn’t ali baba people are disappointed. Then shoot themselves in the foot by thinking all these things...bao feng is great. But isn’t ali baba so people are hating on their own speculation
7114 2018-01-10 15:47:28 the biggest “i’m sick” moment in life: investing a shitload of $$$ into crypto currency then finding out the shit takes almost a week and a half to process/bounce back
7115 2018-01-10 15:47:25 Kodak launches its own crypto currency and its stock pops up 125%. All these crypto currency starts remind me of the VSE in the 80’s
7116 2018-01-10 15:47:20 Will my stock rise if I tell everyone that I am going to release a crypto-currency?
7117 2018-01-10 15:47:16 Hey @GateHub - It's been 6 days and my ETH hasn't been deposited into my new wallet. Transfer says successful, so where did it go? #crypto #ethereum
7118 2018-01-10 15:47:16 do other crypto currencies have this ?
7119 2018-01-10 15:47:16 Did you watch the High Fee Coin video above?  It makes clear the present day silliness surrounding BTC.
7120 2018-01-10 15:47:12 so glad i dumped all $XRP & $XVG. plan to get new entry if BTC makes a run & pushes them down more.  but alts pumped with last run, so....

7122 2018-01-10 15:47:10 The sad thing about #crypto is that I’ll never be able to roll around in it on my bed like I can with cold hard cash.
7123 2018-01-10 15:47:08 I would love to chat, I'm an 18 year old investor/entrepreneur and have my own company where we teach people how to effectively invest in crypto as well as a variety of markets
7124 2018-01-10 15:47:06 Crypto $ZRX looking ready again
7125 2018-01-10 15:47:06 Any update on Ripple... What are the predictions?
7126 2018-01-10 15:47:02 Your preaching to the choir LOL I'm already in heavily, but need more! If it drops to 500 then im dumping everything else to go as much in as I can then will rely on @justinsuntron all out marketing to get us to the promise lands!
7127 2018-01-10 15:47:01 Sorry, i think that XVG is very overprized now and TRX is underprized, so i’m in TRX now.
7128 2018-01-10 15:46:57 I accidentally removed a coin from my portfolio I’ve just made a transaction with on @get_delta app.  Anyone know how I can get it back? #crypto #delta #btc #xrp

7132 2018-01-10 15:46:43 Already took care of it. I don't need someone picking fights over this. 

Thanks for the kind words and back up :)

7135 2018-01-10 15:46:32 Lmao  yeah i understand. But will it continue to be traded? Plus this world is unregulated !Never know. 

 My hope is that in the future coins will be paired with TRX furthering it’s VALUE
7136 2018-01-10 15:46:29 They are going down for 3 days on a row ... why do you think it will turn soon??
7137 2018-01-10 15:46:29 @jaltucher: „You can‘t light a fire wirhout a spark!“ Thanks for sharing your personal growth and financial trendspotting, which inspires me to grow a little bit everyday and got me into crypto 6 months ago. Boom!

7139 2018-01-10 15:46:14 I am a new trader and have invested in those altcoins, but I am not one bit salty. I have my seatbelt on and im holding on tight for the ride.

7143 2018-01-10 15:46:05 Come on u name with dr. and u come here ask why? This is fucking crypto
7144 2018-01-10 15:46:04 #crypto money 
7145 2018-01-10 15:46:03 Dont sell any krypto at all right now. Unless you are all in on day-trading. And Split coins. Not all in one crypto please :)
7146 2018-01-10 15:46:01 We envision so many #newprofessions or #sidegigs for folks with #limitedmobility or #seniors in #convalescentcare, who may want to play #CleanAppGames for #pureentertainment or to mine #crypto. #Cryptonaires #TrashSorting #LitterSort #TrashReporting #Litterati @Littercoin
7147 2018-01-10 15:45:59 Well said bud. Exactly crypto becoming mainstream means kids, moms, gamers joining something theyre not used to or meant to do. The strong will survive and will be the true pioneers of this revolution
7148 2018-01-10 15:45:52 Who will be gone first. Bitcoin or Munger and Buffett. My bet is crypto will be here in 5 years. But not them... as they freely admit. They don’t understand technology.
7149 2018-01-10 15:45:50 I have a 3 day weekend. Im dedicating it to crypto 
7150 2018-01-10 15:45:48 Mobilizing open source communities to a need to get more serious design/marketing teams and translators on board would be a great way to get #crypto out of its inaccessible geek-programmer developer niche. #CryptoDesign #Cryptocurrency #Bitcoin #Ethereum #ETH #MEW #ZCL #BTCP
7151 2018-01-10 15:45:42 If ripple doubles in price again we could be getting into a some bubble trouble. Not much more room for ripple to run. But it has the publicity and mass appeal to average crypto investors. Take profit at every dollar. Tread carefully.
7152 2018-01-10 15:45:41 Basically $DOGE
7153 2018-01-10 15:45:36 Thanks for having me on. No better way to spend a Saturday morning chatting with cool people about crypto!

7155 2018-01-10 15:45:25 #XRP #Ripple is a great buy right now. With a baseline of this range, it's certain to skyrocket upon next partnership announcement/s and/or additions to more xchanges #Coinbase. Anyone who doesn't have at least 25% of crypto portfolio in XRP should seriously look at it.
7156 2018-01-10 15:45:21 ちょっと頭冷やすのにゆっくりシャワー浴びてきたけれど、やっぱりこれは興奮しちゃう。
先日のネタツイートでmoonは経由で"裕福層"が流入したらsaturnだぽえーんみたいなこと言ったけど、真面目な話「目標1800ドル」だったのが既に安くない…？とすら感じてしまう。
7157 2018-01-10 15:45:21 Done!
7158 2018-01-10 15:45:15 Crypto currencies are secure and can’t be created by lending .. ie the block chain tech should protect us from the thieving bankers !

7163 2018-01-10 15:44:57 In the process of this, people are still buying #TraDove $bbcoin thinking that they're investing in ICO of the "largest and most trustworthy business network."

Can you not see how that is unethical?

7171 2018-01-10 15:44:18 Why didn't the partnership with Boafeng & #TRON make any waves on the price of #TRX? As a #HODLer I expect price to rise when partnerships like these are announced. @justinsuntron any idea why?

7177 2018-01-10 15:43:58 You need to see blood in order to let it grwo, so everything is fine! ;) I think alot of people are verry happy today, because they can buy more of this coin. Litebit was sold out in a couple of minutes with over 7mio Coins! xD
7178 2018-01-10 15:43:51 Ignore him. You’re still awesome @isabella_crypto and he is clearly confused about the prevent cancer foundation also funding prevention measures (which are massive as early detection = greater survival rates). Hope you have a better day!
7179 2018-01-10 15:43:46 I agree. What the store-of-value.. If you want, buy the gold. Crypto-curency makes "Better than yesterday". Bitcoin core makes "Worse than yesterday".
7180 2018-01-10 15:43:46 Just remember, it was the big banks that took your homes and your jobs during the recession. Crypto is the antithesis of that.

7190 2018-01-10 15:42:49 Yes!  Gold is the alternative to paper currencies and always has been.  Supply is limited.  What's the limit to the number of crypto currencies?  No regulator is going to shut down $GLD.
7191 2018-01-10 15:42:46 Emission? I’m not sure I follow?
7192 2018-01-10 15:42:45 I see my country, I hit like

7196 2018-01-10 15:42:39 im in #ADA and i've been in #XVG for a while, for that very reason, new people have tended to like things like verge and ripple. so why wouldnt they like cardano or tron. i wont touch that lending shit tho. i made enough like this. trx was blatant garbage 2 but a quickie did me!
7197 2018-01-10 15:42:35 I got a big bag of cheap trx just waiting for 1400, will it happen?!

Buffet inability to predict the future of EVs points me to other sources for information - but if I was investing I would put some money in lithium, cobalt, EVs, plus crypto...

7204 2018-01-10 15:42:18 In traditional finance:

>$10b = large cap
$2-10b = mid cap
<$2b = small cap

Not sure if this applies to crypto yet
7205 2018-01-10 15:42:15 but coming off that aggressively to someone who doesn't understand crypto can be off putting.

There are over 100 scam coins out there, various parts of the world. You know a few, we the Crypto enthusiast know about them. But guess what? We treat them as what they are, "A scam Coin".

7408 2018-01-10 15:32:52 Oh boy. @EthereumBlue you already apologized for your early communication style. And then you go and argue with Dan and one of the best browser extensions in Crypto.

7421 2018-01-10 15:31:26 He’s right, crypto currency is worthless. Except to those dumb enough to buy it.

7452 2018-01-10 15:29:45 I'd like to see @coinbase improve the infrastructure to account for the mass interest in #crypto as well as bring on some more customer support specialists to speed up their trouble ticket resolution time.

7456 2018-01-10 15:29:34 When doing your charts, could you give an estimated time frame? Also, what time do you use for the candle sticks? I pulled out of GAS the first post in it because i lost on it 2 days in a row. Now its doubled since then and i am regretting it :/
7457 2018-01-10 15:29:34 all i wanna talk about is crypto lol I see why the original crypto ppl talked about it so much
7458 2018-01-10 15:29:28 Still amazed at the buying opportunities I was getting a month ago on #altcoins, so glad I was taking as many as possible. Got a lot to be thankful for in $crypto.

Does a dip on low volume have a different meaning than one on high volume? Alts have dipped but on low volume
7466 2018-01-10 15:28:33 Did you guys here about the Tron plagerized white paper?

7469 2018-01-10 15:28:27 Yes I was there..that terrible summer.. we all thougjt it was done  But I remember ETH did not fall that much while loosing dominance. So yes we have cycles but it does not mean that eth neo or other will loose much, the may as well continue rising.
7470 2018-01-10 15:28:25 Crypto currency is such a beautiful concept. Can't wait to see what the future holds!

7474 2018-01-10 15:28:12 Should probably leave this Kodak short alone. Not what I'm good at. Up pretty nice today as well. I'm clearly biased against these crypto plays// old pump and dump ptsd maybe
7475 2018-01-10 15:28:12 You know how many people say this? Remember bitcoins presence right now is more so for stability in the crypto market. Everyone knows it’s tech is obsolete. That’s what happens with everything... check your iPhone, you get a new one every 1-2 years...  same concept applies.
7476 2018-01-10 15:28:04 B3 aren't the first to fudge a rollout either. $XVG f'd up with Wraith. The crypto market is impatient and sensitive to relative micro events but the knack is to ride out the furore or at least sell 50% of a 100% ROI if you get cold feet.
7477 2018-01-10 15:28:03 To put it into perspective: @Netflix has 109.25 Million subscribers worldwide.

7479 2018-01-10 15:27:53 I think the reason is that crypto is still a speculative game and volatile and risky, people tend to avoid such investments at all cost during a crisis. But financial crisis isn't the only big macro event. There could be war, massive hyperinflation,
7480 2018-01-10 15:27:52 Is there any news about ios version??
7481 2018-01-10 15:27:50 When will @cnbc @CNBCFastMoney stop interviewing these senior citizens about crypto?? So he won’t put his money where his mouth is.
7482 2018-01-10 15:27:42 They have some improvements to make, such as minor stability fixes and adding more trading pairs. But all in all they could be a good competitor
7483 2018-01-10 15:27:40 Hasn’t anyone learned anything from the rise and growth of Bitcoin and crypto? This correction is good and growth will continue to trend upward. We need these impending technologies.

7486 2018-01-10 15:27:34 My Prediction is that by the end of 2018  there will be more crypto currencies than people on planet earth.

7509 2018-01-10 15:25:56 I always suggest people when u get your profit on #crypto trading take your own  money and trade with only profit if u do not follow the rule I can guarantee you will loss at the end of time

7513 2018-01-10 15:25:37 Personally, the rise of other crypto is worrisome. It challenges the utility. It has to serve some purpose now besides providing illicit means. This is why I'm a bit lost now
7514 2018-01-10 15:25:37 i believe it's the only dividend paying xchange coin.
7515 2018-01-10 15:25:30 False. The quickest way for crypto to over take fiat is for fiat to continue destroying itself. When you can't get money out of your ATM, you WILL seek alternatives.
7516 2018-01-10 15:25:30 100 JPY(BTC): 1202.980 ~ 1208.230 KRW(BTC)
7517 2018-01-10 15:25:25 Crypto don't need fake announcements that cause crashes.
7518 2018-01-10 15:25:23 I love someone waking me up to talk against  #crypto  when they don’t participate. My thoughts are as follows:

1. Mind ya phuckin business 

2. I no longer converse with people who are not trying to radically increase their wealth

3. Everything is cyclical.
7519 2018-01-10 15:25:22 Wait till they start pumping 1biilions coins per year.
7520 2018-01-10 15:25:11 There's a lot I still don't understand about the whole crypto currency thing
7521 2018-01-10 15:25:05 Amen! One of the best crypto comment so far!
7522 2018-01-10 15:25:02 So switch to segwit exchanges like @bitstamp or @GeminiDotCom

In Pakistan they are reduced to 1.2%.

In Bangladesh they are reduced to 6.5%.

7541 2018-01-10 15:23:58 So it will dump after launch, great strategy for US citizens - buy post ICO. Sweet. Regardless, I am a Suppoman fan. Keep up the good work bro, your positive attitude is great for crypto. I think BitConnect is proving itself more every day personally. I have a toe in. U don't? :)
7542 2018-01-10 15:23:57 ああ〜〜BCH気持ちいい〜〜
7543 2018-01-10 15:23:55 You know what all this crypto market moves proves that #BTC is still #KING it's just showing everyone that all this #ALTS are a pump & dump scheme and eventually all that  will be suck into #bitcoin by the big whales & seasoned traders noobs don't get #REKT play smart.
7544 2018-01-10 15:23:50 Anyone interested in joining a free telegram group with daily stocks/crypto chat let me know. A lot of great signals have been put out from this in chat in the past year and this group will only be free for a limited time get in now while you can.

7550 2018-01-10 15:23:40 My current crypto portfolio breakdown:
#Ethereum - 35%
#Bitcoin - 25%
#Ripple - 15%
#Monero - 15%
#Tron - 5%
#Altcoins - 5%
7551 2018-01-10 15:23:37 It's funny that we're now getting crypto currency updates via news outlets. "Bitcoin is crashing!" "Ripple is surging!" "Ether is very confusing!" Seems like a terribly inefficient and slow way to disseminate that information.
7552 2018-01-10 15:23:36 So USD keeps getting weaker in this fake inflationary environment: I would prefer playing hot potato with crypto than buying $SNAP (both are only worth what the next person is willing to pay)
7553 2018-01-10 15:23:35 crypto has been a negative influence on his life
7554 2018-01-10 15:23:33 Exactly i like the locker 
7555 2018-01-10 15:23:29 MONAは600円くらいで仕込めたら良いなとか…
7556 2018-01-10 15:23:26 Crypto currencies might not last, but blockchain technology is the wave of the future man.  It's an amazing breakthrough if you understand that side of it, you can see the potential.  I'm not talking price here.
7557 2018-01-10 15:23:18 Sorry for being silly and something I've not understood. How is 50k to 75k x4 ?
7558 2018-01-10 15:23:15 I get it that you are not A financial advisor. I appreciate your insights that’s why I joined the feed. I have purchased a Ethereum Programming course. As a strong believer in the future of block chain, They are doing the right things, in my opinion.
7559 2018-01-10 15:23:08 @maison_crypto 
what about xmg

7560 2018-01-10 15:23:07 What, no crypto-currencies?
7561 2018-01-10 15:23:05 Probably dumb kids that bought in with Christmas visa gift cards and don’t know and damn thing lol
7562 2018-01-10 15:22:55 Overall bear market right now. If you follow the charts you will see when the bears will lose steam and the bulls will pick them back up. Just watch them closely and look at the volume, macd, candles etc.
7563 2018-01-10 15:22:49 keep spreading that FUD bro...DOLT
7564 2018-01-10 15:22:46 $poe is high risk,  continue to hold it should rise,  if you want stability check into coins like $neo and $onion they have strong communities, working products and will hold value better.
7565 2018-01-10 15:22:42 I could call it the Crypto Factor Currency Show!
7566 2018-01-10 15:22:38 We are making America Great By using Block Chain and Crypto!!!
7567 2018-01-10 15:22:36 色々戦略立ててるから何か仕入れたら光速で教えるよもちろん！！
7568 2018-01-10 15:22:35 I think the @BitScreener app with their in-app purchase is the best on the market now that they’ve added real-time portfolios. I like the synopsis of each coin/token and that you can see the supply and exchanges it’s traded on.

7571 2018-01-10 15:22:28 $FDX is the hotness.  This is a long hold for me that my friend/mentor @MindYourCoins turned me on to! #FDX is a marketplace that allows traders to buy/sell pieces of life insurance policies through the blockchain. Still low cap! HUGE market and potential! #bitcoin #crypto
7572 2018-01-10 15:22:27 *crypto*
7573 2018-01-10 15:22:27 This a great article in @TechCrunch about @telegram working on a new cryptocurrency to message money on its platform. Great news for @Tigereum! Expect Telegram to support payment bots like Tigereum to send crypto. Bring it on! #tigereumtoken #ICO #crypto

7580 2018-01-10 15:21:51 I also remain bullish on $xcp $etc and $ioc

7583 2018-01-10 15:21:43 I may have to burn my Nerd Card for admitting this, but when I hear someone slangily throw the term “crypto”-as-in-currency into the mix, it takes a second to remember they’re not talking about Cryptosporidium. #dunningkrugerrands
7584 2018-01-10 15:21:37 デジャヴ！？！？
7585 2018-01-10 15:21:35 Over the holidays I took the time to explain crypto to older folk in simple terms. Most of them had been misled or given poor explanations.

It's not fun money, it's a logical next step for currency. Question is which one comes out on top.
7586 2018-01-10 15:21:31 good call!
7587 2018-01-10 15:21:29 Куда присоединяться? в телеграм

7589 2018-01-10 15:21:20 H8r. It’s no surprise that the older generation will bash on crypto now that it’s become more main stream. Old people always bash on new tech/stuff, just cause they don’t understand it.
7590 2018-01-10 15:21:19 What’s your crypto strategy, buy and HODL or day trade?
7591 2018-01-10 15:21:13 Of een zak trekdrop of een hele dag kauwen op zoethout

7600 2018-01-10 15:20:48 It's depends on what crypto that you fill in your investment bag?

If you choose unregulated, decentralized, anonymous, untraceable, or whatever. Those keywords are leading you to ravine of destruction. Be wise my brother.
7601 2018-01-10 15:20:48 Thank you for your updates. I would anxiously wait for your TA on #Vertcoin @Haejin_Crypto

7605 2018-01-10 15:20:44 Not sure because crypto price is too  high for one, can be on other values, for purely speculative purposes  even to ruin this new currency and its small investors

7609 2018-01-10 15:20:37 Thanks
7610 2018-01-10 15:20:31 Furthermore, I think crypto will tank just like equities during  the next crisis
7611 2018-01-10 15:20:25 @CoinMarketCap removed 50B worth of cap due to them not including 3 of Korea’s biggest exchanges. This causing people to panic sell when they see a 50B drop in one day on one of the biggest marketcap checking website. It’s just time to buy more.

7615 2018-01-10 15:20:05 So they are getting into crypto? Thanks for highlighting $HMNY in your subscription videos. Sold my call debit spreads for 61% gain. #powerofpulitzer
7616 2018-01-10 15:20:02 Two... Plus a third one for the crypto currency podcast I'm co-hosting, but don't have to do much with that T the moment. Too many I think though! 
7617 2018-01-10 15:20:01 Thanks brother! Anything you're super bullish on atm I need to look into? 

Btw sorry about any late replies between day job, crypto and life in general getting my ass kicked

7621 2018-01-10 15:19:49 It may pump back a bit due to how big the dump was but not back t the level's it was anytime soon
7622 2018-01-10 15:19:41 Problem is only accredited investors can get a 5 year put on crypto's as just like shorting US mortgages, it can be done, but will cost you a steep premium to do so.
7623 2018-01-10 15:19:36 イーサイクラビッチに季節の草コイン添えとくくらいか…
7624 2018-01-10 15:19:32 That’s the only reason I’m on Twitter. I have learned a lot. This place is great. Trading crypto is like speed trading a year of stocks in two days.

7629 2018-01-10 15:19:17 Kodak went from $4 to $11 with the announcement that it was launching crypto, if I would have kept the order of 3000 stocks I would have won a mini lottery.
7630 2018-01-10 15:19:15 I can appreciate your position on the matter. In all fairness, I'm not challenging @coinbase to a duel, simply increasing visibility to the fact that it would be nice to have $XVG on their exchange. more access to the #VergeCurrency while the project is still growing is okay!
7631 2018-01-10 15:19:14 It will be WINNER regardless of your unimaginative nicknames.
7632 2018-01-10 15:19:13 @bitcoinprivate posted the tweet. People are guessing the date b/c of the lock being set to 16. Not confirmed by any means, but if you believe everything is intentional, it could be a hint.
7633 2018-01-10 15:19:12 @Crypto_God in what coin should someone invest 2000 eur and expect profit?
7634 2018-01-10 15:19:04 Agree, was using crypto as a generic term and not a specific technical implementation

7640 2018-01-10 15:18:54 @Crypto_Brahma you always on point. One of the few I had to follow. Thanks for the calls and the research you do. 
7641 2018-01-10 15:18:44 ?
7642 2018-01-10 15:18:42 @BitcoinTre - Congrats on the new baby. Would you do a video on what your portfolio might look like if you were to invest $100, $1000 and $10,000 today? Thanks #bitcoin #ethereum #crypto #portfolio #cryptocurrency #altcoins
7643 2018-01-10 15:18:42 agreed. but i just think think the outright and upfront transfer of wealth to ripple founders and early holders, in the billions of dollars, will be very hard to get past shareholders and regulators; whether the crypto-anarchic ideal is anti-regulation is irrelevant for now
7644 2018-01-10 15:18:41 oh it can be made up.. You ever seen the stories from penystock land .. 
Cone shaped pizza can set the world on FIRE 
7645 2018-01-10 15:18:37 The next financial crisis? I highly doubt it. I do not see crypto being dominantly a macro play at this point. It is rare that any market prepares for a financial crisis, it is more reactive and after-shocks are when big money flows in.
7646 2018-01-10 15:18:37 I told God if I hit a million dollars in crypto, I will start a foundation and begin helping people in need in the Philippines.  I’ll make first donation to foundation and then I’ll be coming to all of you for donations next. 
7647 2018-01-10 15:18:36 LOL
7648 2018-01-10 15:18:34 I'm not sure about that
7649 2018-01-10 15:18:30 Fifty days in Crypto-land is like a Century.
7650 2018-01-10 15:18:27 West
7651 2018-01-10 15:18:26 Nothing compared to crypto!
7652 2018-01-10 15:18:25 XRP is down just like any other crypto. Is not an XRP issue is the whole crypto market going down. At least for XRP I assure you that it will not be for too long. With that said, this is certainly a great opportunity to buy more and wait.
7653 2018-01-10 15:18:19 If you are sitting on 20x, 50x, 100x your money on a crypto investment, it would not be a mistake to sell 10%, 20% or even 30% of your position. Selling 25% of your position on an investment that is up 50x is booking a 12.5x on the entire investment #Bitcoin $crypto
7654 2018-01-10 15:18:14 Here's a tip: if you want to make friends in the crypto world, don't ever suggest that the price of cryptos could do anything other than rise parabolicly.
7655 2018-01-10 15:18:08 Hey Mocho..      You ever get to the Los Angeles area, or the U.S. in general Mate?

7677 2018-01-10 15:16:38 I read that limiting electricity supply will actually lead to a surge in prices of crypto as supply will decrease
7678 2018-01-10 15:16:30 With all do respect @WarrenBuffett This statement makes no sense: "If I could buy a five-year put on every one of the cryptocurrencies I would be glad to do it," Buffett said.

7694 2018-01-10 15:15:38 to much money invested in something that he doesnt understand (and Buffet never invest in something that he dont understand) That make him see crypto as a not trust worthy asset but from every big change (bubble is you want) great company and products succeds and stay for long..
7695 2018-01-10 15:15:37 It's easy to make calls you won't live to see the outcome of.

7708 2018-01-10 15:14:31 can anyone planning on investing in crypto please just literally set their money on fire a la KLF. it'll be over much more quickly, with less stress all round and might even be kinda cathartic
7709 2018-01-10 15:14:31 @Altcoinbuzzio I think for the price correction by coin market cap make this fall so amateur traders start panic sale their coin and market goes more  down so create good entry point for institutional players to come in an  invest see what gonna happen in next three week :)
7710 2018-01-10 15:14:25 All the shit you keep copy and pasting to me has no relation or relevance to me lol
7711 2018-01-10 15:14:24 Well 99% of people who invest in btc market don’t know shit about crypto, but touting your investments does make sense if you have followers. I’ll never be a tout in that sense, but I get the logic behind it, even though it does seem very sketchy with all the pump + dump tactics.
7712 2018-01-10 15:14:21 Today is red day in the crypto wild wild west, except for #ETH rallying but beware the massive correction before or after the #ETZ hard fork. Yes, because after cancelling the hard fork #ETZ decided to uncancel the hard fork.
This is how you dont build confidence in your product!
7713 2018-01-10 15:14:17 Guys a camera company announced they were going to start a crypto currency and are up over 200% in 2 days. When will sanity take hold again?
7714 2018-01-10 15:14:05 Curious what you mean by a turnaround coming?
7715 2018-01-10 15:14:03 What i can say is, Tron's partnership with companies are not very well-known to us. The chinese website that he is partnering with does indeed have high traffic. However, the partnership's are incomparable to global big corps which is what we want, for a big pump (growth)
7716 2018-01-10 15:14:00 Watch total market cap. If that increases and trx doesn't then we have a problem.  Till then BTFD.
7717 2018-01-10 15:13:57 Ah sorry something went wrong! But I'll make sure you get it later and you just keep doing your thing

7721 2018-01-10 15:13:38 He may well be correct. However, if people place faith in crypto over fiat then he might he wrong. Depends how you're looking at this...
7722 2018-01-10 15:13:26 Where else would they put the chips!?
7723 2018-01-10 15:13:26 I wouldn't say all, and I'm not disagreeing that now's a good time to buy the dip. Eth has been killing it as a top crypto, but it seems top coins under $2-3 are dropping double digits.

7755 2018-01-10 15:11:55 You are right this 2018 is the year for eth no doubt it will be tripple or more the price you see now because all the project after finish ico they are lunching but i dont want to hold ether until their next update. I am not a financial adviser its just my findings or guess
7756 2018-01-10 15:11:54 I love Eth and want to believe this, but the flippening won't happen with ETH. #ETH is drastically overbought right now b/c of ICO's. The last time this happened, #BTC slapped Eth so hard that it cut its value in half and went through a 4 month sideways correction. Be careful..

7764 2018-01-10 15:11:17 To the extent there's a limit in the market, its how much total disposable assets are available to be put into crypto. However, that $$ will come at the cost of other investments (like stocks or bonds) and not only from other crypto currencies.

7798 2018-01-10 15:08:57 Because PRICE PREDICTION sells! People want validation for their choices and need constant reassuring. I don’t trade, but I like analysis, it’s a tool to help gauge the overall crypto climate. And the Queen rocks!

7823 2018-01-10 15:07:47 Daily Crypto Tip: do not keep your cryptocurreny holdings on third party exchanges. Always use cold storage offline. We recommend the Nano Ledger S! #cryptocurrency #LedgerHQ

7827 2018-01-10 15:07:42 Talk 9 at #realworldcrypto. Yasemin Acar answers to the question whether crypto APIs designed for usability lead to better security.

According to their study most of the devs find it impossible to validate a certificate. Also, document your code well so that people will use it.
7828 2018-01-10 15:07:41 And the SR game Dev devoting more time to marketing the game than finding the newest crypto currency! Kappa
7829 2018-01-10 15:07:41 What does mean to hold 35% for 2020? Is it mean TRX circulate 65% of his total volume? If so then it reach near to total volume, and is it mean to boom on feb2018?
7830 2018-01-10 15:07:37 I believe in the project & the future of where $XVG is going. I don't need to see dollar valuation to have confidence in @justinvendetta ability deliver one of the most incredible coins in the market. While also building partnerships, infrastructure, and acquiring vendors.

7832 2018-01-10 15:07:29 Why is @rogerkver so obsessed with making Bitcoin Cash be referred to as Bitcoin? If Bitcoin Cash is so much better, it doesn’t matter what it’s name is. The tech will prove itself and the market will adjust accordingly.
7833 2018-01-10 15:07:25 You know for the price correction by coin market cap make this fall so  people amateur traders start panic sale their coin and market goes more  down so create good entry point for institutional players to come in an  invest see what gonna happen in next three week :)
7834 2018-01-10 15:07:24 It’s over guys, with the release of #KodakCoin, crypto isn’t cool anymore. Good run, but everybody needs to pack it up and go home.
7835 2018-01-10 15:07:23 I see, because in this case no one yet uses KodakCoin, the analogy doesn't hold. So everyone is speculating about which crypto will become the Euro, in essence.
7836 2018-01-10 15:07:18 Make it happen buddy
7837 2018-01-10 15:07:15 If that happens reddcoin will still keep on growing. Reddcoin is for tipping content creators on other social media too. Facebook coin would be only used on the Facebook system for whatever they would have planed with it.

7840 2018-01-10 15:07:10 After Kodak's announcement of getting into cryptocurrency KodakCoin, their stocks soared 120%. Crypto is the future.

7843 2018-01-10 15:06:57 Es que tenes que andar con cuidado siempre, ya que las crypto no son activos, donde tenes balances y análisis técnico y fundamental de donde agárrarte. Es una ruleta.

7849 2018-01-10 15:06:40 Like a washing machine @coinbase tries to spin the truth. Maybe coinbase is the CNN of crypto...
7850 2018-01-10 15:06:38 i've been trading crypto since 2013 and most coins are scams or are dead. very very few markets from the 2013 tops have passed their 2013 ATH in alt/btc terms for a reason.
7851 2018-01-10 15:06:37 A friends grandma's been getting spam calls about buying bitcoin & gave personal details (enough to do basic verification on most exchanges) out.

If you ever talk about crypto to family, make sure they know never to buy $BTC via phone & to consult you first if they want to buy
7852 2018-01-10 15:06:37 One govt’s crack down on crypto just opens the door for other govts to step in and reap the benefits left behind. This is the first permissionless, international financial phenomenon so its resiliency is unprecedented.
7853 2018-01-10 15:06:37 いつリップルは300に戻るのだ
7854 2018-01-10 15:06:35 Agreed. By "place" do you mean 5-10% of portfolio? Crypto vs precious metal showdown in 1-3 years...
7855 2018-01-10 15:06:34 Buffett has said numerous times that you don't invest in things you don't understand. And he's admitted he doesn't understand crypto. So I don't think there's much to see here. Move along.

7864 2018-01-10 15:05:56 Today, we, The Safex Team reminded ourselves that "we are pursuing the vision of the ultimate marketplace, in serving the crypto community." and if I am a leader in this movement, I am a servant, working for our crypto world. #believeincrypto
7865 2018-01-10 15:05:53 O itseng Buffett. A eme pele, we don’t know what crypto is but we are there.
7866 2018-01-10 15:05:52 語学に強いのはいいですな。あとは動きに合わせて対応するだけですな
7867 2018-01-10 15:05:48 追加ですが、1月10日までに現状を報告して、以後毎月10日に報告。ってことは毎月10日前後に何かしらある可能性が高いですね。各地区で電気代、土地代、税収、環境保護等の措置について調整させるみたいです。

7870 2018-01-10 15:05:35 You hating on crypto seems pretty insecure. Are you just mad at all the potential $$ you hypothetically threw away?
7871 2018-01-10 15:05:31 You might want to have a look at @QRLedger, as they use a XMSS-scheme combined with PoS to be quantum resistant. I really like what they're doing, it's a tech-minded project instead of all the hype you usually see in crypto.
7872 2018-01-10 15:05:25 Haha thanks, but that's very NON-Crypto behavior today. All chips are down on the same day. Maybe South Korean have some sort of impact on it. #Crypto #HODL #Bitcoin #AltCoin #Altcoins #altcoinarmy

7878 2018-01-10 15:05:13 wtf, what am i crying about? i've made so many public calls that smashed this coin up and down the chart. this is about new traders not holding coins after a good run into a loss. cycle your money. "long term hold" if for blue chip stocks, not crypto. wanna by some PayCoin? lulz
7879 2018-01-10 15:05:05 What is the name of the guy on CNBC who taught everyone to buy Ripple on Poloniex, step by step?

It could be interesting showing him some crypto Twitter love on social media for his great call.
7880 2018-01-10 15:04:54 おやすみ〜
7881 2018-01-10 15:04:49 good entry point into XRP after recent hit, fundamentals don't seem to have changed as far as I'm concerened #Ripple #crypto
7882 2018-01-10 15:04:40 He may be right about overvaluation in the crypto markets, but why should we care about his perspective on crypto when he clearly says he doesn't understand them?
7883 2018-01-10 15:04:39 Сначала надо открыть телеграм?
7884 2018-01-10 15:04:36 Holding all else equal, theoretically inflation should bolster crypto prices (i.e. scarce supply, etc.). So, rate hikes should constrain price growth. Unless, like gold, crypto is a flight to quality.  @cburniske
7885 2018-01-10 15:04:35 I think zerohedge posted a chart on the market cap of all the coins and BTC has fallen off over the last few months. It's also the crypto with the biggest profile and one of the only few the big boys trade in so it's the biggest target. Cryptos done IMHO
7886 2018-01-10 15:04:30 Thanks man!

7888 2018-01-10 15:04:26 The man has a wealth of experience and knowledge.  Picking on him because of his age is unfair.  He has been very successful for many years, and he is sharing his opinion.  Personally, I think #crypto is in its infancy, and I’m curious to see how it’s adopted in other industries.
7889 2018-01-10 15:04:25 one of the best  and fair distributions (big dev tieam big cominity)
there will be a  dumps at the begining of the trade coz of the easy profit taker coz they got fro free but then new token distirbution and the rel;a investors will step in and the musisc will start playing (
7890 2018-01-10 15:04:20 So many inexperienced jokers in the #Crypto space right now. Hysterical to watch this unfold on Twitter. You invested 1 day ago and are "hemoraging money" "bleeding out". Come on if you can't handle the market please leave. And learn to read a chart $trx $xrp $
7891 2018-01-10 15:04:17 Sorry, my mistake - of course - 7 Currencies, 14 Pairs. And completely agree about time telling how big the effect is.

7895 2018-01-10 15:04:07 I know it may be hard to comprehend but crypto is driving the precious metals market it may not last much longer and I think this may be lining up a bunch of gold bulls for a coming slaughter. Interesting to say the least.
7896 2018-01-10 15:04:06 Its completely up to you my friend all the best
7897 2018-01-10 15:04:02 You won't be saying that by the end of 2018. Reddcoin is being used all the time on reddit and twitter using the Reddcoin Tipping Extension. Reddcoin is great for tipping content creators and has almost no fees associated with it.
7898 2018-01-10 15:03:55  “just beat it”

7928 2018-01-10 15:02:36 In the three weeks I’m in to this I’ve noticed that Ethereum is the one coin with most stability. Why is that? I Sense it to be a solid investment for the long-haul. I’d like to hear your thoughts
7929 2018-01-10 15:02:26 Go home Tron, you're drunk....this is how a standard "shill" cycle works in crypto. Still a good project tho :) $TRX

7947 2018-01-10 15:01:33 i guess if emotion overcomes logic sure, but to justify selling in crypto at a loss of that extent, you're in the wrong game

Your obsession with the big evil "OGs" is just a bit annoying is all
7950 2018-01-10 15:01:27 Majority of the people in the #crypto world don’t understand that bitcoin value is as important as the price of any crypto they invest in. If #Bitcoin value goes down so does the value of other #cryptos. Everything is connected to bitcoin since you buy other cryptos with bitcoin.

7960 2018-01-10 15:00:44 In his thread, he clearly says he understands why twitch would want to do something like this as and expanding platform and isn't mad at them at all. He didn't mention free speech at all rofl

7972 2018-01-10 15:00:06 hmm... First he said, Crypto is going to end badly. Following statement was, why would I invest in something I don't understand? 
But is it okay for him to comment about something he doesn't understand??

7984 2018-01-10 14:59:29 totally. i mean, look at crypto. most twiiter accounts rolling thinking they own the place and are gone in less than 6 months. why? because they emotionally chase pumps and sell the bottom.

8005 2018-01-10 14:58:19 I have already replied to one of his tweets, we need to retweet the shit out of the replies about crypto
8006 2018-01-10 14:58:14 II would like to ask you a question missNotashi: What do you think about  $NAS? The YouTuber Crypto Love think this will be the coin of the year. The blockchains Google. What's your opinion?
8007 2018-01-10 14:58:09 Nope, i wish i had listened to you though . Im hodling a little bit of xrp, trx, doge, dcn. Looking at Eng at the mo, it's way above my price range but lots of potential.
8008 2018-01-10 14:58:00 What do you mean?Why is the price down?

8013 2018-01-10 14:57:45 first off, hardcore is shyte. lol

i've been trading crypto since 2013, so i've traded lows to highs on cripple many times, not just once

10x gains is for noobs

if you want to hold into a 90% loss & wait nearly 3 years for a pump i got some magic beans to sell you too
8014 2018-01-10 14:57:40 if people are bad at balancing their bank accounts, taxes/book keeping, credit card payments...

but then all of a sudden they feel the need to be a crypto/investment expert

To me... that's as scary as it gets. 

Poor money management + investing = world of hurt.

8017 2018-01-10 14:57:32 Using Slack is more akin to watching TV than to 2000s era social networking. They have "channelized" social networks. I "flip through" channels each morning, from introverts, to js devs, crypto geeks, etc. browsing for a convo to join.
8018 2018-01-10 14:57:32 @OracleOfCrypto Hey man
Thanks for the FAQ. Regarding Blockchain Education, as I am not a trader but I desperately would like to learn to become a full time trader and take advantage of the opportunity at the moment in the crypto space, I would just like to know if:
8019 2018-01-10 14:57:28 I sell defence-grade tech that detects bad actors without that, just using traffic patterns. US and UK govts want this to access our data, not find a few bad guys.
8020 2018-01-10 14:57:24 I haven’t been able to purchase any Litecoin due to the market pause
8021 2018-01-10 14:57:13 He's been quoted as saying he doesn't understand crypto so what the point of this article?
8022 2018-01-10 14:57:10 You must want it to, because the more you put this kind of negativity out there it surely will.

8027 2018-01-10 14:56:55 En ce moment mes investissements se font grâce à mes profits uniquement. Ma stratégie est simple; je mets x montant dans une crypto, et au moment où j'atteints un 100% de gains, je retire mon investissement initial et je fais mon retrait.
8028 2018-01-10 14:56:50 Nice move CMC. As so many others have said... You should have informed of the Korean exchange exclusion before doing it.  As crypto is global, I think you cannot just decide to omit a market. I will not use your website anymore.

8037 2018-01-10 14:56:13 So many more altcoins can do what bcash claims to do but far better and without a attempt at the bitcoin name lol. False marketing.
8038 2018-01-10 14:56:10 What do you mean? I just bought another 6k of these little Reddies! ;) Great day for buying #RDD
8039 2018-01-10 14:56:05 Just cut the amount of alt positions I have in half. Easier to focus on my trading strategies and stop-losses.

8042 2018-01-10 14:55:53 Of course. The rest of supply is there to buy #altcoins. The dominance of $BTC down, Global Market up, $BTC price range (12k5 / 17k) and #altparty will continue :)

8046 2018-01-10 14:55:41 In future when <your fav crypto> is widely adopted as currency, given the limited supply, the distribution across population would mean a majority of people will own amounts that are cumbersome to denote. If 90% of 6bil own 10% of 21mil, we have 0.078 units/person

8053 2018-01-10 14:55:07 It's an analogy of holding the same crypto that you trust will give lot of values for the people in the future and let the market decide what is the true value itself.

8067 2018-01-10 14:54:08 Might push the $ up a little bit. Ripple is really not new in Japan. Will be a bonus if the price is cheaper than where they are already getting from.

8070 2018-01-10 14:54:01 He should articulate that clearly but he just says they will all end very badly which is not right. Also extreme exuberance or euphoria in any market is going to end badly that is not an insight and its not just specific to crypto.

Wrong on so many levels. #coinbase #gdax #bitcoin #litecoin #bitcoincash
8095 2018-01-10 14:52:47 survey says.........NOPE!
8096 2018-01-10 14:52:46 中国マイナー規制か
8097 2018-01-10 14:52:45 The fact kodak jumped 70% due to announcing a new crypto just shows how insane this bubble is
8098 2018-01-10 14:52:40 You're clueless and ignorant and habe no idea of how business or investing works. TRX is quite possibly the most important crypto that is going to change the world the most. The price now means nothing. It hasn't even began yet.
8099 2018-01-10 14:52:37 A lot of the cryptomarket trending down today. #cryptocurrency #crypto #cryptocurrencies #altcoins #altcoin #btc #binance #bittrex #coinbase #bitcoin #dgb #xvg #trx #marketflux #ridethelightning
8100 2018-01-10 14:52:36 I hope you know that would mean $xrp has over a trillion dollar market cap. That's 4 times larger than $btc and $300 billion larger than all of crypto. Please do some research and buy something with real upside
8101 2018-01-10 14:52:35 Folks buy Ethereum classic,going to give you huge gains in the coming week. But with full power
#ETC #Ethereum #Ethereumclassic #HODL #Crypto #cryptocurrency
8102 2018-01-10 14:52:28 The ignorance and greed of this man is staggering. Crypto is a threat to his investments so he tries to kill it.  Go ask that to all the factory people he unemployed so ketchup can be .03 cents cheaper and a tax write off for a foreign investment. He's a butcher. Rich though.
8103 2018-01-10 14:52:17 That wouldn't matter with crypto if there were only one. (Our currency no longer matches gold reserves).
8104 2018-01-10 14:52:13 When will the token sale details available?
8105 2018-01-10 14:52:10 both coins I would not fomo in, it can go x 100% 200% in long term, but other coins has more potential that can go like 500% or 1000% , which coi you pick ? hehe
8106 2018-01-10 14:52:10 You can only hodl till hits zero -:)
8107 2018-01-10 14:52:04 Isn't the whole premise of crypto inside trading?
8108 2018-01-10 14:51:58 Do you trade BTC or any other crypto?
8109 2018-01-10 14:51:54 TRON is a long term HODL. It's a solid company with a great vision. Sit back and relax.

8123 2018-01-10 14:50:47 BitconnectX?
8124 2018-01-10 14:50:44 Wow $KODK really pulled a new-age trick and their stock soared. Maybe @CashApp should announce their own blockchain or just add "crypto" somewhere in the name...
8125 2018-01-10 14:50:42 what does it say about me that I always read buffett as buffet...I agree tho that a crypto buffet would also end badly
8126 2018-01-10 14:50:35 1月は悪いニュース多いですね
8127 2018-01-10 14:50:34 Secondly, people are underestimating the impact that a financial crisis coild have on crypto

8130 2018-01-10 14:49:59 So the Chinese are banning bitcoin mining now, getting ready to launch their own state controlled crypto soon?
8131 2018-01-10 14:49:53 ya that's it. Crypto market usually moves up in the second week of the year.
8132 2018-01-10 14:49:44 ホントかウソかはどっちでもいいよね。
大衆がどう動くかに合わせてポジションとればいいだけですね
8133 2018-01-10 14:49:42 That's silly. Modern apps don't have "the server," they use a collection of APIs running on a variety of servers. There can be very good reasons why you'd trust some of those servers but use crypto to defend against compromises on others
8134 2018-01-10 14:49:38 @BobsRepair announces its Moscow Crypto, Treasure Hunt. The USB stick is hidden in the Red Square and has a code worth 25,000 BOB Tokens. #BobRepair
8135 2018-01-10 14:49:27 smart people in crypto have patience and trust the data.  as an exec recruiter in By Area tech for 20+yrs.  I know that @ripple will crush it.  all of the patterns are aligned.  #xrp #xrpthestandard #ripple
8136 2018-01-10 14:49:25 It's "blog post" not "blog," "cryptocurrency" not "crypto," and you probably mean "rebut" not "refute."  Thanks
8137 2018-01-10 14:49:22 $KODK will b remember as turning point that destroyed crypto "stock" trade. Going forward crypto trading in BTC.X ETH.X etc not in stocks
8138 2018-01-10 14:49:21 It's honestly so funny to see the powerful old white men in the investment industry poo poo on Crypto and then have to shamefully retract their words later on Get with the times grandpa, we're moving off of fiat whether you like it or not lmfao
8139 2018-01-10 14:49:18 Shhhhhhh, quiet please. Still buying before it takes off.

8142 2018-01-10 14:49:16 Good morning! Yes I said "good". Just because the overall market is taking a shit doesn't mean it's going to be a bad day. The ups and downs of the market are normal and healthy. Remove emotions and look for an opportunity to get into something undervalued. $crypto $btc $xrp $eth
8143 2018-01-10 14:49:14 We have Crypto and Blockchains as focus. Again and again.; we are not a Bitcoin Core exclusive club. 

You say we have a Bitcoin focus but you don't want to become a member because you like Bitcoin?? You can't have it both ways

8145 2018-01-10 14:49:01 Great post Alex. I told a guy this am that i work in research in the investments industry. He asked if he should sell his crypto currency investment or if it might continue to rise in value. “That’s not investing” was my rather smug reply.
8146 2018-01-10 14:48:56 China will buy more gold and crypto $btc $gbtc

8152 2018-01-10 14:48:17 เปิดแล้วก็จัดเลย ต้องลอง 555 ก็เอาเงินเย็นมาลองดู สักไม่เกิน 10% ของพอร์ตลงทุน ที่เหลือก็ลงหุ้น กองทุนไปตามปกติ คิดซะว่าถือ crypto เป็นสินทรัพย์ทางเลือก
8153 2018-01-10 14:48:15 I'd buy more NEBL but annoyingly all my crypto money is tied up elsewhere and mostly in the red... so to move into it would have to sell at a loss. Very frustrating 
8154 2018-01-10 14:48:11 The race is on to find a replacement to the dollar as the world's reserve currency, but will #crypto convert easily into, or become the new reserve?  US Treasuries are about to crack.  Watch for stocks to go up... A LOT
8155 2018-01-10 14:48:10 Or maybe it is the death knell for crypto currencies?
8156 2018-01-10 14:48:09 Do you understand market cap?? Because the total crypto market has done nothing but continue to grow higher and higher. Which means that alt coins are getting bigger market caps. 650 billion market cap is nothing.
8157 2018-01-10 14:48:06 Well damn they were open earlier, I'll keep you guys informed
8158 2018-01-10 14:48:01 Nice chart, but the fundamentals strongly disagree. Bitcoin etf will send demand through the roof.

8161 2018-01-10 14:47:44 Please don't put your money in any crypto currency before understanding it's concept, we need here more investors, no traders. Any purchase of cryptocurrency should be validated by questionnaire to eliminate FOMO and FUD people.
8162 2018-01-10 14:47:43 In the project Mira to buy crypto currency, the user goes to the site or to the Mira application, selects the necessary crypto currency, pays and downloads the encrypted file containing the purse address and private key from it. #MiraLab
8163 2018-01-10 14:47:42 Broken through the resistance, retest of previous resistance now turned support. When it goes it will be like $wtc yesterday. Textbook stuff.
8164 2018-01-10 14:47:42 I always liked #WarrenBuffett but talking about #crypto not knowing his head from his butt about the tech and going public.  Very disappointed. #ethereum #bitcoin #gdax #coinbase #litecoin

8166 2018-01-10 14:47:25 All these dinosaurs have most of their money in the stock market and the crypto currency market is directly in competition with the stock market so of course they’re going to talk bad about the crypto market it’s only natural
8167 2018-01-10 14:47:20 nope --> happy to answer question
8168 2018-01-10 14:47:13 Understanding the technology, and understanding the manic investor confidence driving the market are two very different things. One can be understood. The other can only be observed.

8176 2018-01-10 14:46:35 How's crypto anar-cap looking?

8178 2018-01-10 14:46:33 Yeah agree just wish to see a little spike and hold just being realalistic....but I know crypto doesnt follow rules.  Am a little concerned but still holding and do hate all that to the moon crap or its going be 10$ by end of Jan just stop the Crap lets be real instead of pump BS
8179 2018-01-10 14:46:32 中国の噂は大体否定されてから最後は真実でしたってオチが多いよね
8180 2018-01-10 14:46:27 Because SOME people are weak minded and enjoy selling out for losses instead of holding like a boss. It will come back and come back with a vengeance. Wish today was pay day. I would double down in a heartbeat. There's still more good news to come. #TRX #TRON

8182 2018-01-10 14:46:23 Problem is it’s not as simple as assessing if interest rates - inflation of fiat can outperform deflationary rate of cryptocurrencies... real challenge is huge volatility risk so it may be insane to manage portfolio by treating crypto as simple FX (for now).

8191 2018-01-10 14:45:54 @Swamy39 What do you think of crypto-currency? Will the currently available bitcoins work, or there will be a completely different cryptocurrency that will result from some IMF decision?
8192 2018-01-10 14:45:53 @piggycoin - Good for parents and children alike.  Looks like piggy coin aims to introduce the next generation to crypto currencies and promote savings through HODLing in your piggy bank.

8203 2018-01-10 14:45:19 Guys & gals. No joking that this scan is FANTASTIC. These crypto stocks plays as everyone is aware have been on fire the past few weeks. Crypto mania as I like to call it is making many day traders serious money of late.

8213 2018-01-10 14:44:51 Solid list. But where's @Njackso7 (Noah) on this list? The dude's a sleeper crypto artist, knows his TA well, makes crazy solid picks. If you follow people in crypto on Twitter, adding @Njackso7 to your list is also a must. Congrats to everyone on here!
8214 2018-01-10 14:44:44 Because everyboby count in USD the value of bitcoin it’s a race to pump the stock and to be the first to sell. To get USD. No body is ready to pay with crypto when the day after you could have bought the double with it.

8230 2018-01-10 14:43:37 Acabo de ver el video de un canal que se llama 'Ty's Crypto Help' (supongo que da tips de cryptocurrency) en el cual menciona que no entiende muy bien el concepto ''filing for bankruptcy''.

8241 2018-01-10 14:42:45 How about looking into how Trump signed a bill that would legitimize crypto currency by making it tangible property just to turn around and have the sec put a stop to it cause they got cut out of the deal...
8242 2018-01-10 14:42:43 I have a feeling we aren't at the crypto cycle "top" until Bitcoin drops from 1st in terms of Market cap.

Stands to reason that this metric, with all its flaws, will galvanize the mania.

Just a feeling.
8243 2018-01-10 14:42:35 How he can go on for 30 minutes about crypto security and not tell America who paid for dossier and not fired McCabe is beyond me !
8244 2018-01-10 14:42:32 Yes, we all were expecting this. Not the usual kind of #bitcoin investor. "I don't know anything abou ...", but you know that it will end badly and you do want to buy a put on every crypto. Yes, well done Warren. See you in 5 years. #btc #bch #eth #xrp #doge #XBT #hodl

8246 2018-01-10 14:42:19 The best part about #crypto is making money the easiest it’s ever been made 

The worst part is knowing exactly how much money you COULD have made 
8247 2018-01-10 14:42:10 awesome, never laugh before like your tweet
8248 2018-01-10 14:42:03 What threat does mining have on China? It seems this would be beneficial to the economy. If they wanted out of crypto altogether, wouldn't it have made sense to shut it down back in September when they were talking about a ban?
8249 2018-01-10 14:41:51 @GuyCreal Do you know whether there is a DBIX wallet for Mac?
8250 2018-01-10 14:41:50 The pattern of the graph of #XRP looks like we’re gonna get a dip again, many analists say strong support at 1 dollar, and even a stronger support level at $0.36... Although I have full confidence in #ripple . Don’t be surprised if this happens first. I keep them. #HODL #crypto
8251 2018-01-10 14:41:46 u tweet crypto once , and u get like a random follows out the ass. makes me cringe.

8257 2018-01-10 14:41:24 Reality check. Try to use your crypto right now,,,pause,,,thats how much its really worth. I can get visa and I can get amazon in seconds with bitpay and only bitcoin, If im hungry this moment I cant buy food with crypto, We need atomic swaps for this reason, That opens the door

8260 2018-01-10 14:41:15 Crypto currency may have sell off but block chain is here to stay and don't think Buffett invested in Amazon or Netflix either and only added Apple recently.  He is late on technology and I think he has missed this one too.

8287 2018-01-10 14:39:59 crypto crowd doesn't understand how this shit works - talking about: "Buffett should put his money where his mouth is."

can you imagine a bank taking the other side of that bet? "yes, hello, this is Warren Buffett, can you make me a market for a giant short Ripple bet?"

8293 2018-01-10 14:39:21 I’m sorry but if you bought ripple at $3.50, you were asking for it. It’s funny how norms are into ripple cause of the cheap price, but couldn’t manage to figure out why it’s #2 on the list if the price is “so low”. One day they will learn about supply, one day
8294 2018-01-10 14:39:16 Hype is over. It is still 10 Times higher than 2 Weeks ago
8295 2018-01-10 14:39:12 go go buy and hodl #TRX
8296 2018-01-10 14:39:02 There is no such thing as 'easy trading' in crypto's, if you are a daytrader. There are many variables to keep an eye on, constantly updating your charts and only seeking for the best buy opportunities instead of chasing trades. Can't find a good buy opportunity? Then don't buy.

8323 2018-01-10 14:37:35 Bought 10k more of #trx, @justinsuntron will make this the first mainstream crypto currency.

8378 2018-01-10 14:32:48 仮想通貨の本義は〜は仰る通りで、これはBTC等の非中央集権型のブロックチェーンを採用している通貨が該当します。一方、XRPは目指す所が違っていて、リップル社が中心となり既存の金融機関や決済システムとの共存・繁栄を狙っています。続く
8379 2018-01-10 14:32:48 That’s amazing! How does tron assist with that company? Or is it a project they will be working on?
8380 2018-01-10 14:32:45 *You, naive*: All this money I spent on crypto is gone! What the hell! 

*me, losing exactly as much*: Actually this was my plan from the beginning.
8381 2018-01-10 14:32:44 うーん。。。リアルであうと刺されそうなので遠慮しておきますｗｗ
8382 2018-01-10 14:32:37 John, need to relax with the pump crew you have created. You are more than likely passively losing Newbs a lot of $. Reorganize your #crypto philosophy. jmo
8383 2018-01-10 14:32:28 How you just make up a currency crypto currency tf is that I know Jackson Franklin and whatever the other craka name is 
8384 2018-01-10 14:32:24 This is great. But as I can't be trusted to put on a few £1 accas at the weekend without chasing my losses for weeks I might have to stay out of the crypto game for now

8388 2018-01-10 14:32:02 No, you said that #BCH is now what's #BTC really is, and instead of answering, you begin to attack me.

Looks like we can't find compromise here, you seems blinded.

8394 2018-01-10 14:31:38 crypto is more secure but its value is easily manipulated cause of its small market share!
8395 2018-01-10 14:31:36 Was lucky enough to get in when price was cheap. Already made great gains. Profits taken and HODL is now the plan.

8397 2018-01-10 14:31:26 That’s why I’m bullish on crypto because it’s not any of this... ask me why? Because the internet used to be just as hard to use.

$LEND @ $.04. - took 25% profit 
@ $.40 put into $APPC @ $3

8451 2018-01-10 14:28:47 He doesn’t say he doesn’t understand crypto, he says that it’ll come to a bad ending. That suggests he has analysed.
8452 2018-01-10 14:28:47 that is exactly what I liked about it... I dont give a shit about crypto.

They were wrong to buy World Book, and wrong to get into the newspaper business, and in the long run wrong on crypto.

8473 2018-01-10 14:27:19 Yes correct!

8477 2018-01-10 14:27:13 He probably is right, but I don't see it happening anytime soon. The old investors should maybe start to realize crypto is a good thing. Its getting millennials into trading.

8488 2018-01-10 14:26:50 These btc market has a lot of bias right now. People "betting" on the future of price has nothing to do with operating the market itself. Bitcoin will rise or fall if the market decide to do so, people seems to misunderstand that.
8489 2018-01-10 14:26:45 we see after 02.02.2018 how much crypto can spike! People now is the last option to profit from crypto currencies. buy, buy, buy but only selected currencies! not scams
8490 2018-01-10 14:26:40 No, it hasn't yet. But its current decline is the start to 'death'.

8529 2018-01-10 14:23:59 Dear Crypto zillionaires there is a fellow called @WarrenBuffett who you may or may not have heard of but he is probably the best investor that’s ever lived ,he says BTC , going to end badly .
8530 2018-01-10 14:23:55 Don't get your hopes up. I've been waiting 3 weeks for a broken #XMR withdrawal, and so far silence from support. But maybe because you have more @Twitter followers than me you'll get some help...
8531 2018-01-10 14:23:55 いつも見させてもらっています。すごくいい人と思います
8532 2018-01-10 14:23:51 I don't claim to know more than anybody else, but the fact that they have not made any statement despite their exchange being down for a week now and that this is crypto leads me to assume the worst.
8533 2018-01-10 14:23:42 Holy shit
8534 2018-01-10 14:23:29 @ys, keep up the great work brother!  Your knowledge, insight and feedback on all facets of the crypto game is greatly appreciated! Ty
8535 2018-01-10 14:23:21 Comparable company Netflix 100 million users... this company 200 million user.. it’s a big deal
8536 2018-01-10 14:23:12 And that's short sited. Meanwhile you have billionaires like Peter Thiel dropping money into the crypto exchanges.
8537 2018-01-10 14:23:11 @coinbase @brian_armstrong coinbase has to speed up their process to add cryptos or hire better team. Losing value of crypto due to investors migrating to other exchanges! Poor show by CEO.

8549 2018-01-10 14:22:17 Your welcome.  Only thing I can see for sure is a correlation between the two.. at a really macro level this is a unique pattern in the nature of crypto that just continues to play out over and over. It is very fascinating for sure.  Yeah DM with any questions.

I don't think he is knocking Crypto, or its potential application. I think its more a testament of his investment discipline
8562 2018-01-10 14:21:53 as a noobie I love the red sea its like Christmas only been in crypto for a month and missed some serious  x10 opportunities even if I had got in a month earlier so these red seas are wicked. Also highlights the good coins from the shit coins

8567 2018-01-10 14:21:48 Maybe, just maybe, you should dig a bit more deeper into these ICOs before you endorse them. They're are a bunch of people (for reasons I don't quite understand) who pay attention to you for crypto and you're just crazy irresponsible with your endorsements

8584 2018-01-10 14:20:50 Correct ($XRP and $LINK holder here). Though as you know, Ethereums' current state might not be it's state in 1-2 years and LINK can always migrate to another chain if they wish to. Any way, LINK's concept is too good to not add this to your portfolio (imo).
8585 2018-01-10 14:20:49 yeah it was obvious that they want to hide identity for some reason. It looked fishy on the first look.

8597 2018-01-10 14:20:03 With #bitcoin experiencing pullback and correction, our prop strategies in crypto markets are significantly out-performing Bitcoin and are positioned to take advantage of the next rally phase.
8598 2018-01-10 14:19:34 It appears to me that prople start to realize that the only advantage that #bitcoin has is the first mover one. It isn't much more like a tech demo for the #blockchain technology I suppose. My guess is that #crypto is a idealist bubble and only #blockchain will survive.
8599 2018-01-10 14:19:29 2/ Bittrex has 70%+ of all of #vertcoin total volume. This means with all the new money being flooded into the crypto space, most of that money is going to other coins. Not vertcoin. Second, Vertcoin does not surround their coin with hype. Coins like #TRX and #XVG gains with hype

8601 2018-01-10 14:19:03 Seeing the entire crypto market in a blood sea is making me so sad. These exchanges need to start allowing new sign ups again and stop us all from hemorrhaging thousands of dollars.

This is a great line I keep reusing, because it's almost all old people predicting the end of crypto.

8642 2018-01-10 14:16:06 Totally agree! I got in in Sept 17 and it’s a big learning experience. If they can’t handle volatility or want to do research to try under why the market is doing what it’s doing, then they best off getting out! I hold $ADA, $TRX & $XRP
8643 2018-01-10 14:16:06 If I held Tron I would look up the Tron wallet. I've owned Tron but never attempted to put it on a wallet. So I can't recommend one but the first thing I'd do is head to look up the best #trx wallets or keep asking on here. Each crypto currency has their own wallet.

High speed transfer facilities. 
Most of the crypto coins are listed over there. 
Platform is very convenient to trade. 24hours service facilities are available. 
It is highly secured as bank. 
It has it's own coin to trade against other coins.

8746 2018-01-10 14:08:55 Question-- did you guys not plan for growth. Did you not forecast as a company your exchanges growth potential. It pains me to see days go by wasted because a company failed to forecast their own growth potential. As awareness continue to grow with crypto so should the exchanges

8790 2018-01-10 14:05:47 No-one likes to hear "bad" views on Bitcoin.

However, if you make plans for the worst (which is far from what @Super_Crypto is predicting) but hope & trade for the best you shall enjoy relatively stress-free trading, with fewer surprises.
8791 2018-01-10 14:05:40 So it looks like today's crypto announcement is $COGT ?
8792 2018-01-10 14:05:40 The inflation rate in the crypto is huge. One is due to mining and issuing new coins and second is new cryptos coming to market (not just xxx.Bitcoin Fork). Goldman is completely wrong. in the long run crypto will be the best money, but a poor store of value, no inflation hedge.

8816 2018-01-10 14:03:36 The Crypto market gets deeply passionate about one coin but one day, drops it and "moves on." It often searches for new trends. May not care about the logical value of a coin. Likes projects that want to help the world. Makes men feel invincible.

The Crypto market is a woman.
8817 2018-01-10 14:03:36 Crypto currencies are here to stay. Warren Buffet is making assumptions on his old school theories. And so will all old schoolers who agrees with him.

8820 2018-01-10 14:03:15 *ADVICE FOR CRYPTO NOOBS PART 2*

1. Learn to spot where in the market cycle we're in. 

2. Have your sell target set before you've bought in.

3. Less indicators, more clarity. Pick 2-3 per chart.

8821 2018-01-10 14:03:15 I struggle with this too because the money I made is close where I wanted to go but this has turned it into far more then I have ever dreamed and I now want to try and make a living on it. I want to master trading crypto so when the day of less volitility comes I'll be ready.
8822 2018-01-10 14:03:15 Hopefully will trade laterally til some ICOs hit exchanges 
8823 2018-01-10 14:03:11 I am really disappointed that instead of supporting me for being a part of $TRX family, you're insulting me for owning other coins too. :(
8824 2018-01-10 14:03:07 Smart move lol I got some too. Look at ETN. That one has been doing really well for me and it’s on a dip now

8827 2018-01-10 14:03:04 A note for #crypto noobs: Don't be fooled, no one enjoys seeing their @BlockfolioApp decrease in value.  The silver lining is this: more reasonable buying opportunities open up; tokens are "on sale." Small buys on the way down=nice positions.  $NEO $ACT $ETH $BTC $ICX $UTK $SPANK
8828 2018-01-10 14:03:03 @mhartl Welp sensei, $3k fell from the sky and I have a 94Mh/s #ethermining rig running. Can you give me, or the world, some mobile apps you’d like to see? Anything missing in the crypto space? Seems like it could pay. Thank you.
8829 2018-01-10 14:02:59 Are any of them cancer research or prevention charities? If not, it is not an apples to apples comparison due to differing goals. Handing out funding grants and encouraging preventative screenings need more education than say organizing a food drive.
8830 2018-01-10 14:02:58 Don't invest now ...there are many better opportunity ...check out top 20 coin & decide yourself
8831 2018-01-10 14:02:49 Congrats 
8832 2018-01-10 14:02:48 I see a future where I pay much more with crypto, even my house, rent, energy. Maybe everything :-) Wish you good luck and a great success in development
8833 2018-01-10 14:02:25 Awesome. 
8834 2018-01-10 14:02:02 I'd wait until things start turning green and pick something that fell off a cliff

8841 2018-01-10 14:01:38 Crypto is a fad just like $AAPL hahahaha
8842 2018-01-10 14:01:36 It will only increase due to speculation
8843 2018-01-10 14:01:35 You need to store it in your wallet
8844 2018-01-10 14:01:34 It's because literally all of crypto hates bcash, what a  sleezy tactic to be calling that shitcoin the real Bitcoin.

8846 2018-01-10 14:01:33 spammy head line, crypto genius seems pretty scammy. Also gives bad advice. Hold on to your money.

8848 2018-01-10 14:01:20 People, your portfolios are down right now due to $ETH `s run up for the last 24 hours.  Understand, it’s all a process and once ETH current run up settles down, money will flow back in. Patience and breathe!

8858 2018-01-10 14:00:38 Fundamentals Analysis tells you WHAT to invest in, while Technical Analysis tells you WHEN to buy/sell. The majority of people will use Price Action to determine what to buy. This is why FOMO and Panic Selling happens, and it's why people lose money. #Cryptotrading #Crypto

8863 2018-01-10 14:00:25 we probably wouldn't have that nice Internet on which the entire crypto scam ecology runs without massive Federal government R&D spending and debt markets funding the infrastructure rollout.  Two things anathema to the Crypto mindset.
8864 2018-01-10 14:00:22 Somehow I thought companies investing in crypto would invest in the existing economy vs building islands. Should have learned from ICO season.
8865 2018-01-10 14:00:21 Charlie Munger tells @BeckyQuick sees bubbles in Crypto currencies and venture capital now. Too much money chasing deals. Too much excitement. Weird economics... @CNBC interview w/  @WarrenBuffett
8866 2018-01-10 14:00:15 In the crypto world, it’s all about how many people are talking about the crypto & how convincing they are. Forget traditional fundamentals and common sense.
8867 2018-01-10 14:00:15 Stop asking old people about crypto currencies. Crypto is the future of finance. Stocks will someday trade on a Blockchain.

ALWAYS HODL

8886 2018-01-10 13:59:10 now you may find this hard to believe, but some of us dont just buy shit cause others tell us to, mcafee worked for the sheep like yourself, but for people who research and do this as a job, we read charts and keep our ears to the ground, you understand now Pocahontas?
8887 2018-01-10 13:59:07 This is gonna make interesting as all hell data science.

Where they store their money after the fact (post pnd) will be more interesting part.

8892 2018-01-10 13:58:52 @WarrenBuffett said if you bought crypto because the price was high yesterday, you're gonna get it trouble. Correct. It's gonna be very hard to predict a short before a bubble burst. 800+ cryptos but only 10-20 will survive to long money. Pairing due to fees will be important

8901 2018-01-10 13:58:12 Het feit dat je al zegt, dat het niet in de top zou komen. Heb je al aangegeven dat jouw "vele" kennis alleen in het geld verdienen zit en niet in het gebruik van de munten. Als je de crypto's gebruikt waarvoor het bedoeld is, kan je van Doge niet zeggen dat het een troll is.
8902 2018-01-10 13:58:04 There is no such thing as an undervalued cryptocurrency. They are all in a massive speculative bubble. Soaring inflation will anhiliate this sector. Watch as people dump worthless crypto idiocy for CASH to buy food and other goods that will soar in price

8904 2018-01-10 13:57:56 The funny thing is I've been in $CRYPTO since 2013 and don't know a single person who trades regularly on hitbtc. I've often wondered if most of the volume there is entirely fake.
8905 2018-01-10 13:57:51 I really need dual screens so I can trade crypto and watch charts all day on one screen and then fake semi work on the other
8906 2018-01-10 13:57:49 Many people losing sleep over dips in crypto such as #Ripple #Tron and #Iota. I’ve been trading FOREX many years before #Bitcoin was even popular. #Crypto is so easily predictable. Look at their values a month ago. You’ll know that #HODL is the way to go. #Patience get some sleep
8907 2018-01-10 13:57:33 Guys and Girls, have you seen #QLINK ($QLC), it's traded on Kucoin exchange.

Huge potential, I mean HUUUUUGE potential - It is a decentralized mobile network, is dedicated to constructing an open-source telecom infrastructure on blockchain. Very recent ICO.

8920 2018-01-10 13:56:37 You know what just hit me after listening to @garyvee ?  This is the age of attention arbitrage and conversion.  Bitcoin and crypto is only valuable because of the attention it has. I think this is a “tangible” representation of that relationship

8947 2018-01-10 13:54:56 Yeah, I guess we never advocate for it 'knowing' it won't get better. In fact, we want it to get better in time, as normalization occurs and the world goes crypto.
8948 2018-01-10 13:54:48 Lots of good blockchain ideas coming out, like #KodakCoin for image rights mgmt, but mashing it wth crypto currency feels like a stunt. Is there room for pure blockchain ideas right now?

8954 2018-01-10 13:54:24 What is the best mining pool distribution on @hashflare for Sha-256, Scrypt and Ethash? #mining #crypto #hashflare
8955 2018-01-10 13:54:18 The first thing should happen to you when you enter #Crypto is that you should get #REKT , don't take it wrong but it's a mandatory first step.
8956 2018-01-10 13:54:17 Eth consolidation range for the day,  bull flag forming  1260/1365,  next target $1526
8957 2018-01-10 13:54:06 Are you happy?
8958 2018-01-10 13:53:58 Had a quick look at your profile. Man someone is upset they didn't buy any BTC 
8959 2018-01-10 13:53:52 Is it time to sell or HOLD?
8960 2018-01-10 13:53:47 I think I’m currently being tickled. Id like to move onto the next phase now please. When finger removed?
8961 2018-01-10 13:53:39 Im buying Ripple for a really cheap price now! $XRP
8962 2018-01-10 13:53:39 Rand why do you choose to invest in 50+ tokens/coins and not just try to choose the 10 best. Now if one booms your portfolio almost doesn't feel it and you need the whole altcoinmarket to go up. Then you can just pick 10 either way
8963 2018-01-10 13:53:36 BTC plz stay down
8964 2018-01-10 13:53:35 Now why would amazon limit its market to that segment. Not gonna happen bro. Yea Sure they will accept crypto but they will never exclusively accept only one form of currency
8965 2018-01-10 13:53:35 The PR yesterday from $RIOT barely moved the stock. Traders have largely moved on to other crypto plays. A secondary is likely coming soon. I wonder why anybody would be holding this right now?
8966 2018-01-10 13:53:34 Be ready To Dance bro
8967 2018-01-10 13:53:32 EPIC!!SOUTH KOREAN CHINA N JAPAN ARE LOOKING INTO JOINT CRYPTO REGULATIONS SELLING BIG IS ON THE HORIZON SO HOLD STEADY!
8968 2018-01-10 13:53:32 When buying any #crypto it’s super important to have an unlimited number of other things in your life to take your mind off of it when it’s down #TRX $trx #XVG
8969 2018-01-10 13:53:27 Buy the dip: $ella
#ellaism #crypto #altcoins #BTFD
8970 2018-01-10 13:53:25 Wtf 
8971 2018-01-10 13:53:24 Xrp starting to reject from $1.6 support level too... coincidence 
8972 2018-01-10 13:53:24 Believing in @justinsuntron and $TRX isn't much different from believing in Jack Ma when he was trying to start @AlibabaGroup from his apartment. If you're looking to truly invest in Cryptocurrencies pay no attention to the price today and HODL or buy whatever the coin!
8973 2018-01-10 13:53:20 Your rap name is Lil’ + the last thing you bought with your crypto winnings
8974 2018-01-10 13:53:14 The person who keeps trying to buy 6.4 $btc of $bch but keeps missing and having to retry.  Hope they get it before it moves! #crypto
8975 2018-01-10 13:53:13 Where did you post these calls? I haven't seen them.
8976 2018-01-10 13:53:11 やっほーい
8977 2018-01-10 13:53:07 haha :D
8978 2018-01-10 13:53:05 Days... Ppff in crypto are days nothing! I waited 7 years with my Bitcoin #TRX #TRON 
Give this coin at least 2 years
8979 2018-01-10 13:52:59 Which crypto is Alibaba going to use? $TRX or $XRP

Think smart. Big money being moved.
8980 2018-01-10 13:52:52 2018 Sure Lock it brother
8981 2018-01-10 13:52:48 Well played  But the $CND 
8982 2018-01-10 13:52:43 I would say the incompetent devs are the ones that broke Bitcoin ie: Core. And I am a dev... do you even run a Full node or you just discovered Crypto the last 6 months?
8983 2018-01-10 13:52:38 Molly + shrooms + a sunset = nirvana
8984 2018-01-10 13:52:28 Buffett calling it like he sees it! Ultimately, ascribed market value goes *poof* without intrinsic value. Crypto currencies have no intrinsic value, no backstop, nothing of the sort. I don’t understand why @CNBC have been so recklessly pandering to this nonsense.  

Cc $KODK.
8985 2018-01-10 13:52:27 売り時を気をつけて5555
8986 2018-01-10 13:52:23 you need to know the price of BTC when he bought it. what day was this?
8987 2018-01-10 13:52:20 I'm getting active on twitter, andn following few discord groups. Crossed 100 followers :D So that's an achievement i guess. And yes, i'm trying to make a brand but its not crypto related. You can check my instagram link in my profile. #Positivilization.
8988 2018-01-10 13:52:16 Someone "entering" crypto today is a little late and FOMO'ing all over the place.
8989 2018-01-10 13:52:14 Digital currency welcome @Kodak to crypto-moment as its plans to launch an initial coin offering! As Kodak stocks prices more than doubled yesterday @SkyCorridors queen of crypto
8990 2018-01-10 13:52:09 Most people that voted for drumpf don’t have brains
8991 2018-01-10 13:52:01 @realmccoy32 why is everyone always looking for fast gains.... u want fast gains? then go play crypto, this is a long term hold.
8992 2018-01-10 13:51:51 Thats because the entire crypto market dropped. Perhaps a correction.
8993 2018-01-10 13:51:49 @charliemunger talking about the future bubble burst in crypto. Too much liquidity and speculative money. I think they just believe that brick and mortar will still out-perform digital.  #cryptocurrency #btc #xrp $xrp $eth
8994 2018-01-10 13:51:48 Mama, don’t take my crypto coin
Mama, don’t take my crypto coin

8997 2018-01-10 13:51:41 What about the global economy? If crypto traders were all from one country's economy..
8998 2018-01-10 13:51:37 Only up until they're the MOST important thing in life.
8999 2018-01-10 13:51:36 2 minute of silence for those who said $XRP will rise to $7 and overthrow $BTC to become the $CRYPTO with the highest market cap.
9000 2018-01-10 13:51:33 but (correct me if I’m wrong) Chainlink runs on Ethereum? Hardly able to deal with kitties. And slow.
9001 2018-01-10 13:51:31 Ta Looking forward to it.
9002 2018-01-10 13:51:28 What if I want to say it doesn't mean that no one should be able to say it.
9003 2018-01-10 13:51:24 a good website to learn these that you would recommand ?
9004 2018-01-10 13:51:06 It's actually a slaughterhouse out there... for the majority of the crypto! I like action! #crypto #panic #marketcap #funny #moments #entertaining
9005 2018-01-10 13:51:03 Add $DBIX
9006 2018-01-10 13:51:02 Yeah. Done. It would be awesome... :-)
9007 2018-01-10 13:51:00 I would consider $NMS also.
9008 2018-01-10 13:51:00 Kodak are getting their own crypto currency. KodakCoin
9009 2018-01-10 13:50:51 $INPX $AMRH $KODK $HMNY #blockchain #Crypto stocks very high on Pre-Market.

9012 2018-01-10 13:50:46 #Vibe only #vibe   everyonr needs fair crypto arbitrage and financial sharing on exchanges
9013 2018-01-10 13:50:44 Firstly ,Just get involved in the crypto community as much as possible . Twitter , YouTube , discord , steemit etc. Make your own channels if your educated enough and get those referrals coming in. Your brand and your positioning is key for future opportunities.Just my opinion
9014 2018-01-10 13:50:38 After hearing that Kodak stock doubled after announcing their entry into crypto currency, I am opening a new business - Burgers and Bitcoins.  Get your stock options now!

9021 2018-01-10 13:50:17 When did Mexico ever say ty would pay for it? Dummy
9022 2018-01-10 13:50:15 What’s the next call? 
9023 2018-01-10 13:50:15 What range you got before takeoff?
9024 2018-01-10 13:50:14 The good news about Korean capital controls: when the clampdown comes, it will have limited *real* impact on the global crypto market.
9025 2018-01-10 13:50:13 What do you think of bismuth?

9029 2018-01-10 13:50:03 Damn dude.
9030 2018-01-10 13:50:01 I havent seen you calling all these tokens.
9031 2018-01-10 13:50:01 $WISH is extremely UNDERVALUED.
9032 2018-01-10 13:50:01 Bro u wrecked by elf
9033 2018-01-10 13:50:00 I think xrp is a safer bet to double your investment

9036 2018-01-10 13:49:55 Bloody hell! Congratulations!
9037 2018-01-10 13:49:51 Did u pronounce this before?
9038 2018-01-10 13:49:48 I know buddy but remember what Buffet says ' crypto is the transference of wealth from the impatient to the patient , shit takes time
9039 2018-01-10 13:49:44 sure, there are other ways to participate - buy stocks that use blockchain technology. so in a sense Buffett is already investing into technology through proxy, for example IBM stock. just a though, funny how one bashes crypto space but is invested himself into technology
9040 2018-01-10 13:49:43 Cheers for the ad @MillennialRach glad I've finally found a crypto girl to follow, seems they're all dudes! 
9041 2018-01-10 13:49:42 With the current volatility, 5year put might cost as much as the crypto. Good luck to Buffet.
9042 2018-01-10 13:49:35 Alright, who the fuck has any fiat left in these tasty dips? #needmorefiat #crypto #mortgagecanwait
9043 2018-01-10 13:49:35 Exactly why we need to be especially careful about sgx or any secure enclave based crypto currencies.
9044 2018-01-10 13:49:28 that Forbes article on tax treatment for crypto transactions shows what a mess it is. IRS calls bitcoin 'intangible property' and so usual currency trade considerations won't apply. Suspect many just won't declare $$ #tsktsk
9045 2018-01-10 13:49:27 You forgot to att the -1k, +2k, -3k, +4k differences in price per update lol
9046 2018-01-10 13:49:26 Next call?
9047 2018-01-10 13:49:20 仰る通りです。テクニカルは参考にしかなりませんね。引き続き警戒は必要です。ありがとうございます。
9048 2018-01-10 13:49:14 Thoughts on crypto currencies. Thinking of a dabble with Ripple
9049 2018-01-10 13:49:12 Seeing wallet is out of sync and the withdrawal request from cryptopia is still unsuccessful.. Any solution? Let me know if i can hold the coins in cryptopia itself?
9050 2018-01-10 13:49:10 Just over 3 litecoins purchased.
Crypto, I'm all over you 
9051 2018-01-10 13:49:08 I think it's time for the US Treasury to issue crypto-tokens to countries with current account surpluses with the US.

9062 2018-01-10 13:47:57 This just in: Warren Buffet the #4 richest man in the world and one of the top Apple share holders, doesn’t own an iPhone, still uses a Samsung flip phone and says crypto currency will end badly.

9066 2018-01-10 13:47:30 Caro, i am driving now,  can't type at length.  If ripple was not worth it.  It would not be in top 5 crypto for the longest time. They are a lot of good things  happening in 2018. Hang tight.

9070 2018-01-10 13:47:10 A basic IQ test to join crypto?

9086 2018-01-10 13:45:33 Any suggestions on trading crypto currency today?
9087 2018-01-10 13:45:25 Any crypto less than 3 yrs old makes that a good bet. Most will not survive that 5 yr period.
9088 2018-01-10 13:45:21 Ethereum price surge during a BTC dip is great for crypto. Money's not flowing into fiat but into the next best known blockchain $eth $btc
9089 2018-01-10 13:45:18 I and this crypto ehn.. Fight to finish
9090 2018-01-10 13:45:17 Nailed it with $13200 - looks like an ABC... bull flag. Nice insight with the MACD
9091 2018-01-10 13:45:16 deskside with @julieverhage is the only deskside crypto chat i want and even that should be as limited as possible
9092 2018-01-10 13:45:05 .@Kodak is selling a #TOKEN to do something crypto companies have offered for free for years--and some have charged, but can't get anyone to pay for it. They literally ripped off the space. 
 
Yet people will buy the stupid thing anyway. And nobody will use it. Total stock pump.
9093 2018-01-10 13:45:04 ？？？
9094 2018-01-10 13:45:03 You do realize you can sell your Litecoin on Cryptopia for USDT and then purchase ETN.... Lmao!!

9097 2018-01-10 13:44:58 How crypto commentary works: The ‘no coins’ scream “bubble” and the hodlers shout “it’s going to the moon” 
9098 2018-01-10 13:44:51 Noob crypto fanatic here, I’m 2.4 kids normal 9 to 5 guy! Would love to jump ship from rat race and do crypto full time. Anyone done it, any tips?  #cryptotwitter #BitcoinFutures
9099 2018-01-10 13:44:49 @sridentcrypto @SHNDcoin has huge potential. New website and white paper coming out in a week or so. An amazing community and team that is working hard for @SHNDcoin to succeed! Also 2018 is expected to possibly have an up to 15trillion$$ crypto market cap
9100 2018-01-10 13:44:46 How does it look?
9101 2018-01-10 13:44:30 Definitely $sub. Aims to create a truly decentralized interned. A new one. Not the current one shared. It’s also implementing a native dApp platform which includes a universal crypto payment system. Beta is in the works. Final launch later 2018. And much more...
9102 2018-01-10 13:44:27 People got greedy and that’s why they got crushed #crypto #greed
9103 2018-01-10 13:44:25 If s korea comes with a regulation. Its not a bad idea i feel and once this korean drama is finished, crypto gold rush will resume again. 
9104 2018-01-10 13:44:22 There is now an otakucoin for those who watch anime to get it for watching. Then the national banks are trying to as well so they can regulate crypto currency lol
9105 2018-01-10 13:44:15 I'm definitely holding my TRON for the long term... #trx #crypto

9108 2018-01-10 13:43:54 @WarrenBuffett said Bershire will never invest in crypto- why would he short on an investment he knows nothing about when he continually gets in over his head with multi-million dollar investments he actually knows about. I love it, HODL $XRP to pair with ETH in the future
9109 2018-01-10 13:43:48 Shout out to @readysetcrypto. Good insights on crypto review.

9111 2018-01-10 13:43:35 Yeah I saw after I tweeted lol
9112 2018-01-10 13:43:35 どこぞの買い板がなくなったpumpコイン界隈は、コミュニティというより被害者の会って感じがしてアレ…(多分本人達はまだ自覚してない)
9113 2018-01-10 13:43:31 ププってなった^ ^
9114 2018-01-10 13:43:28 I like crypto and believe in the blockchain longterm. What I don’t like is manic greed; main street will HODL the exploding potato.
9115 2018-01-10 13:43:27 There are telegram official Channel?
9116 2018-01-10 13:43:23 The reason I am doing so many giveaways as of late is because I am so grateful for $Crypto. It has made me richer than I ever was. 1000x+ my money in the 4 years I've been investing. My philosophy to making all of this money is to #HODL $BTC $DGB $ETH $XRP $LTC $VTC
9117 2018-01-10 13:43:14 Yaaay, talk 7 at #realworldcrypto given by my bachelor diploma advisor. Ruxandra Olimid talks about breaking and fixing 4G/LTE and the underlying crypto around it.

9119 2018-01-10 13:43:04 just making sure.  Crypto peeps have to look out for other crypto peeps
9120 2018-01-10 13:43:03 Tips on crypto anyone?
9121 2018-01-10 13:43:02 Wall Street Guys doing Wall Street, nothing to see here... giving access to only the very few... That's not what crypto is about.
9122 2018-01-10 13:42:57 9 days is like 2 months in crypto-time...
I'm glad the public partnerships are moving ahead so quickly though... it adds a lot more credibility to the coin.
9123 2018-01-10 13:42:55 Je viens d'ouvrir un compte sur révolut. La partie crypto est soit payante soit il faut trouver de nouveaux clients pour révolut. Pour l'instant trop tôt pour donner une opinion
9124 2018-01-10 13:42:55 yandık o zaman..hayırlısı
9125 2018-01-10 13:42:54 That's sad to hear, hope it works better soon.

I think I will create a new Marine Corps crypto currency called EGACoin which of course will become the most popular currency in the world through fire and maneuver and will always be faithful to its owners! #EGACoin #SemperFi
9135 2018-01-10 13:42:27 They had a "crypto expert" on my local radio station and he explained bitcoin and named a few currencies. 

The radio host was calling it a scam until a big financial guy who appearntly had lunch with Jamie dimon told him otherwise. 

Are you ready for wave 2 of alt szn!?

Also we can receive or deposit crypto coins from other exchange/wallet as well. Please confirm & let me know time & fees to receive/deposit crypto coins from other exchange too.
& When koinex will resume IMPS INR deposit & withdraw?
9138 2018-01-10 13:42:01 Incorrect. Bitcoin (BCH) can handle 8x (up to 32x) the transactions that Bitcoin Legacy can handle, so even if it was in-fluxed with transactions (which everyone saw coming 3 years ago, hence the long debate), it could handle them easily.
BCH is ready for a mass influx. 
9139 2018-01-10 13:41:56 This country has become a goddamn crypto and liberalism echo chamber...

9147 2018-01-10 13:41:27 #Crypto sector is lower nearly across the board again, with Bitcoin down 3% to $14K. The air continues to leak out of Ripple, off another 9% to $1.87.

9158 2018-01-10 13:40:49 As Crypto get Big, You will see more people like this.
Do not give them your hard earned money.
9159 2018-01-10 13:40:46 ATM its a PITA to convert crypto back to fiat. @ripple / $xrp allows companies to reduce costs, hopefully passing the bulk of the savings onto customers

9179 2018-01-10 13:39:16 Not a crypto advisor but if I were looking to buy Ripple this seems like good spot. DMM Japanese exchange starts tomorrow for $XRP, possible Coinbase add this month and 50% retracement.
9180 2018-01-10 13:39:09 Attention span, new crypto?
9181 2018-01-10 13:38:52 Agree with you. Always invest what you can afford to lose. Invest in more than 1 crypto currency and if the price drops, hold you position.
9182 2018-01-10 13:38:49 the last spasm of corporate rigor mortis who discover that people's FOMO will invest in anything with the word crypto in it

9184 2018-01-10 13:38:47 I understand your point, but the quickest way for crypto to over take fiat is for crypto to become the accepted medium of exchange.  It’s the reason nobody purchases with gold, but it does store value.
9185 2018-01-10 13:38:47 Ha, yes. Crypto profit recycling + new ICO issuance + X = $1.2 trillion. 
I’m really interested in the “X”

9217 2018-01-10 13:36:27 Crypto themes of 2018:

1.Real, operational projects. Not vague-whitepaper-only scams.
2.Platforms. $ETH, $NEO, $UBQ, $NEBL, $ICX, $QTUM, $DRGN, $ADA etc.
3.Interoperability - direct communication between diff blockchains.
4.Scalability.
5.Decentralization, for God's sake.

9223 2018-01-10 13:35:57 Not true. If Bitcoin had the same transaction volume as the BitcoinCash, fees would be super small. In other words, fees are low on bch because almost noone is using it.

9260 2018-01-10 13:33:35 ゲネプロ。
9261 2018-01-10 13:33:34 #ICO #P2PSF The most interesting project recently.  I recommend everyone to participate in the ICO, you can earn a lot of money. The team is very strong #Crypto #Altcoin #Blockchain
9262 2018-01-10 13:33:31 paccoin devs joined twitter january 2018 
does that sound right to you ?
why didnt you check before sending coins ?
also do you have proof you sent the crypto ?
a link to the transaction ?
9263 2018-01-10 13:33:31 Join the club
9264 2018-01-10 13:33:16 How would you look into a new ICO?  I don’t think you could buy based on trends. Is it a fundamental investment at that point?  Just a n00b question and looking for advice #crypto
9265 2018-01-10 13:33:02 what trust? This is obviously a SCAM!!! If not, those are the most incompetent mofo's I have ever seen in the space of crypto!
9266 2018-01-10 13:33:01 Yeah, bitcoins/other crypto are afaik generated by mathematical calculations. A CPU has a few arithmetic-logical units for that but a GPU's shaders are technically all ALUs.
9267 2018-01-10 13:32:58 No it probably gonna down to my green targetbox ( h&s = head and shoulder patern )
9268 2018-01-10 13:32:58 I can actually believe that. That’s a bummer however, lots of hype here about them. It’s crypto, there will be others to succeed. Thanks for your input!
9269 2018-01-10 13:32:53 We will see.. But not the transactions are important, implementation is the key!

9271 2018-01-10 13:32:28 We also need a Crypto Sock puppet
9272 2018-01-10 13:32:28 So many More want to get IN the Crypto markets instead of getting out.. So I don't worry at all. Long and BUY all the way for this new digital asset class. #cryptocurrency #cryptocurrencies #xrp #ripple #trx #tron #tronix #troncoin #xvg #verge #VergeCoin #Vergecurrency

Today I transferred successfully my XRB in my Wallet. It has been days of teaching me to be patient. Crypto Trading is like heaven and hell! Everything can happen. But we still in the beginning of a new era! Thx to @MercatoxCom that it finally worked!
9280 2018-01-10 13:31:46 This woman beeing a subject to doxxing is exactly what should happen to psychotic crypto-fascist feminists. :p
9281 2018-01-10 13:31:45 @Egon_01 Do you know of any sites/ exchanges that allows one to buy BCH with fiat/ credit card/ bank transfer in the UK/EU? A friend wants to get into crypto but I can't recommend core due to ridiculously high tx fees
9282 2018-01-10 13:31:44 swift and chainlink

9284 2018-01-10 13:31:42 When singularitynet's ICO wanted ETH and sold out in 66 seconds, my Dad was stoked because the price that day was mid 600's. ICOs love ETH, large companies love it. It has been the one really stable crypto most of the last few months.
9285 2018-01-10 13:31:42 Oooh the famous needacoin shilled you.... thread. I admittedly bought 80% of that list.
So far, #teamneedacoin is winning

Hi Yousef, my name is Issa and I am following you on Twitter. I would like to join you guys and be part in the things you do in the crypto world. What is the best way to keep in touch? Please follow me and send a PM. Thanks

9291 2018-01-10 13:31:29 Jim, you are terrible at crypto
9292 2018-01-10 13:31:26 #VergeFam who are concerned. The current dip is because of Bitcoin price going down. It's not only #Verge that is affected but ALL altcoins. Keep calm and #HODL.

#XVG $XVG #VergeCoin #VergeCurrency #NextBitcoin #Crypto
9293 2018-01-10 13:31:25 Out of those I'm more bullish on  $zer even though it's had huge gains recently. Super low market cap and way undervalued still
9294 2018-01-10 13:31:21 crypto is like trading pokemon cards. mainly because the majority of everyone acts like a kid...
9295 2018-01-10 13:31:20 What was your price in dollars sorry
9296 2018-01-10 13:31:15 @CryptosR_Us Thanks to you George for saving my portfolio, and spirits from sinking during the first big dip in my short Crypto experience!
  #NULS #ICX #WABI were the saviours.
9297 2018-01-10 13:31:11 Yeah. It's painfully obvious this is a long term coin with a dream team that will do what they set out to do. I am 99.9% sure of this investment and that's saying a lot for the crypto world!

9304 2018-01-10 13:30:44 But how many transactions will be there in Baofeng with trx?
And wuich partner of #TRON will trade most of transaction in  #TRX ?
9305 2018-01-10 13:30:34 This happens because Coinmarketcap does not take into account the price of Yobit, only the price of Cryptopia where 99.9% of trade moves. You can buy in Yobit but you can not withdraw then there is no trade
9306 2018-01-10 13:30:33 うっ。

9313 2018-01-10 13:29:47 LOL #Coinmarketcap is probably bringing down #cryptocurrency on purpose, the total Market CAP of #Crypto is slowly slipping away now, even on #LiveCoinWatch.com!! @CoinMarketCap  is literally causing this to happen. #Ripple #XRP #xrpthestandard #TRON #TRX #XVG #BTC #XLM
9314 2018-01-10 13:29:46 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a successful person to grok #crypto, #decentralization, #blockchain and #society4.
9315 2018-01-10 13:29:37 Well that would be sufficient if that was my only large holding! I'm heavily invested and have a interest in seeing #crypto coins succeed in general!!! I do love #TRX #Tronix $TRX though!!!

9326 2018-01-10 13:28:53 I like what you are doing Ronnie but someone like you, maybe not you but someone with extensive knowledge of the markets/crypto currencies should start a business, maybe a market/exchange that will directly challenge the UN-even distribution of wealth on earth and make it simple
9327 2018-01-10 13:28:49 @CryptosR_Us George what is your take on #XVG now that Wraith Protocol was released? You always say neutral in your videos. I love your videos and advice.
9328 2018-01-10 13:28:47 Ideally crypto currencies would be used to actually buy products and transfer funds but at this stage it is really only being used as an investment platform. Once the volatility subsides you may see it used for its intended purpose but who knows.

9366 2018-01-10 13:24:53 Because they didn't make any information public for the last 1,5 - 2 Years and their president started taking a 300k salary you can assume they're not very charitable. Unless you feel morally right donating to their president.
9367 2018-01-10 13:24:46 もちろんです。いつもありがとうございます。 200円割れも警戒すべきだと思います。これだけ売りが売りを呼ぶ相場だとテクニカルは参考にしかなりませんね。
9368 2018-01-10 13:24:41 I hope all your crypto-dreams come true
9369 2018-01-10 13:24:34 You go tell me. Since I can't see any difference when I use it. I still have 1cent fees, it still works the same as it worked.
BCH changes are upgrades that strengthen the coin.
BTC changes don't seem to do anything... Just make you need to run a full node and pay $25 per TX.

9390 2018-01-10 13:23:12 Some food for thought.
Ok, Bitcoin as the "store" of value.
Exchanges as "banks"
Alt-coins as "bank crypto"

9405 2018-01-10 13:21:22 Well i said basic not traditional;  If youre looking at distribution of returns in crypto, the left tail clearly needs to be independently adjusted against the right tail.  Using any of the distributions in Extreme Value Theory would give you a better risk adj view

9468 2018-01-10 13:15:24 End of a bubble is an exaggeration but every time silly stunts like this happen it shows how some are throwing money at crypto investments unreservedly in the hope of a quick buck. It'll knock the confidence of people who don't understand much about crypto but invested anyways.

9470 2018-01-10 13:15:07 it did, have you been living under a rock sunshine, why do some people such as yourself take to verge like it was your scorned lover or something, its weird its just a very usable, private, low fee and fast coin.

9478 2018-01-10 13:14:07 This isn't about Ice Tea, or Kodak, or Riot or whatever.  It's about investors salivating for easy ways to invest in anything crypto.  I am legit shocked there aren't 10 crypto IPOs a day right now.

9493 2018-01-10 13:13:07 It makes sense but tbf in my opinion a lot of developments in crypto didn't make sense at all. Besides that, bitcoin became smth like a dinosaur of crypto, with high fees and slow transactions.

9565 2018-01-10 13:06:45 Yeah, maybe not this cycle. But if you see BTC eventually going to 100k then 10k ETH doesn't sound thaat crazy.
9566 2018-01-10 13:06:44 This meaning Twitter?
9567 2018-01-10 13:06:44 I suppose we have to wait for further instructions. They've got your email, so no worries.

9577 2018-01-10 13:05:49 It's good to visualize your gains as #Crypto units, rather than fiat value. You must be so confident in a coin, that it is a victory if you acquire more of it, in spite of overall losing value. My short term goal is $5M in 2018, but my medium term goal is 10,000 #ETH in 2-3 yrs.

9591 2018-01-10 13:03:52 Everything #Crypto seems to operate on referrals in some way or another. I can only agree, it's super annoying. Bless twitter to be able to filter words and phrases.
9592 2018-01-10 13:03:48 How?

9599 2018-01-10 13:03:01 The entire crypto market is down. It’s a sea of red. Sure, there are outliers, but the overall cap is down. It’s simply a bear market for a few days. The bulls will have a run very soon. Also Binance is one of the few TRX exchanges, and its having trouble with new registrations.

9604 2018-01-10 13:02:32 A chain of unfortunate events. First coinmarketcap throws crypto out of balance.

9616 2018-01-10 13:01:58 Fairly soon, the hot air from this #crypto market will dissipate. Those that rose to great heights without foundation, will fall & disappear.

9617 2018-01-10 13:01:58 You're right, but it's worth pointing out or rather wondering how much of the crypto cryptocurrency market cap is being centrally held in custody at the large market centers (@coinbase and others) as trusted parties holding private keys, the equivalent of bank and gold vaults.
9618 2018-01-10 13:01:55 Such high expectations for any announcement in #crypto. $MUSIC just released a new product and partnership, but bc its not Taylor Swift people start selling.

9627 2018-01-10 13:01:21 Underlying value of any crypto is speculation at this moment., Having said that cryptos offer value which should generally increase over a period of time. So cryptos as of now should be looked at assets till they start being accepted as currencies if at all.... (1/2)

9630 2018-01-10 13:00:52 Cant predict the time.. for any crypto .. just investing for long term.. but withdrawing my capital once any crypto is double from my entering point.. only profit will remain invested. .. so am waiting for #Ethereum to touch $2,000

9638 2018-01-10 13:00:05 Interesting, however the only reason why someone would drive the price lower is so that they could buy it cheaper - so it is just a matter of time before the price goes back up, otherwise no one would manipulate this coin if it was worthless

9681 2018-01-10 12:54:44 Do you remember the dot com bubble? Crypto is going to make that look like a joke, and Kodak is just the beginning. Wait until major companies like Amazon and Wal-Mart launch their own coins.

9683 2018-01-10 12:54:41 That is logic.. but reality will be different.. there is nothing to stop it from 100 s and thousands... we have to keep in mind that this crypto era could change our concepts of value.. I don’t think any one predicted Spx 2750 at this point in time

9696 2018-01-10 12:53:43 and they themselves will use crypto that has no backdoor. Genie is out of the bottle. Math is already out there. Only ones who lose would be law abiding people.
9697 2018-01-10 12:53:27 It’s another crypto. ETP. AKA. not TRON.. wtf.
9698 2018-01-10 12:53:25 Think you got the wrong guy, I don't do videos. I was in XVG since 120sats, sold a while ago, money has been made, it will eventually go down. DYOR
9699 2018-01-10 12:53:23 yup look what just happed 2-3 hours ago, manipulation works and works well or it wouldn't be done

9701 2018-01-10 12:53:13 The more institutional money is involved inside and outside the crypto market the more you have to consider in the equation of why bitcoin/alts are dropping.

9730 2018-01-10 12:51:08 Let me glance at the whitepaper: 
"The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees. If the output value of a transaction is less than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of the block containing the transaction. "
Hmmmmm
9731 2018-01-10 12:51:03 I love the growth. Hate your trade minimums. Cant get rid of .9999 of an altcoin. Thats a huge oversight.
9732 2018-01-10 12:51:00 Bitcoin is not recognized as a security. Some other crypto can be and therefore will be subject to the same law.

SEC does not mandate investor registration before buying Bitcoin. They do require it for other crypto which get covered by the Howey Test.
9733 2018-01-10 12:50:57 Haha thanks usually don’t reply to the crypto twitters.
9734 2018-01-10 12:50:51 See this coingecko showing that neutron is dropped again to low and even coinmarketcap showing the same thing few hours ago

But on yobit and on cryptopia its showing the higher touch only and exchanges graph not showing this drop

Stop buying neutron i.e scam things

9754 2018-01-10 12:49:29 Yes. I believe in crypto not even the idea and implementation are main things, but hype. Substratum got 114k followers on twitter by regular posting/promotions and etc.People know about product and will use that. That's why I don't see any problems to get 5$ at least in 3 months

9778 2018-01-10 12:47:29 RT BitcoinCryptoMM: Crypto prices dropped yesterday because Coinmarketcap started excluding Korean exchanges from average price calculation.  Korean exchanges routinely trade at 30% higher prices so this caused a big ‘dip’ on coinmarketcap even though actual prices didnt change.
9779 2018-01-10 12:47:21 Wow, that was easy to set-up, thanks..!!
9780 2018-01-10 12:47:12 That means you're only watching the price then. The project is developing nicely, the technical rollouts are coming out, the Partnerships are happening, the exchanges we're getting added to... Everything is falling in line.

The value will catch up organically and intrinsically.
9781 2018-01-10 12:47:04 You are playing with fire mate. Crypto will grow nontheless.Everyone who gets in stays in and then they convince their friends. Better to have slower growth than all this fomo mania.Slower growth means ppl actually have a chance to understand the tech. Faster growth is just greed

9788 2018-01-10 12:46:32 let me guess? you bought you $trx at ATH? Advice from a fellow investor (I have both experience on Stock market and Crypto Market)  Never buy a coin at it's ATH . Always buy on those reoccuring dips because the market is super volatile. The price you see wont stay for long :)
9789 2018-01-10 12:46:29 Hi Youyou!! I sent you (by email) details on an awesome skill-sharing platform that uses blockchain for payments (crypto on a completely tangible, downloadable app!!) Let me know if you'd like more info or for me to just resend the email :)

9791 2018-01-10 12:46:21 ETH back up to 70% of BTC in terms of fully diluted network value. 

The winning crypto currency thesis comes down to whether you think the digital reserve will mimic gold (BTC), or be something entirely new (ETH, TON, etc).
9792 2018-01-10 12:46:20 Bitcoin is not recognized by a currency - either by US or India. SEC recognizes Bitcoin as a digital asset. 

FEMA doesn't apply for Bitcoin.

Other crypto may be squarely pegged as a security and may have applicability.
9793 2018-01-10 12:46:05 I deleted my tweet after seeing Justin’s most recent tweets from overnight. I would think a US exchange for a public listing but I think a lot of people are under estimating what and how China can influence crypto

9806 2018-01-10 12:44:57 Market corrections are good. They test those less invested in the long-term viability of crypto; and those who remain are more resilient.

Consider this: Remember the 1st time you experienced a correction? Painful. However, at your 10th, you know how this goes.

Namaste

9819 2018-01-10 12:43:40 @360_trader This may be a silly question, but if you are not actively trading your crypto positions on price swings to increase said positions, where do you source additional capital from? Other trading activities?
9820 2018-01-10 12:43:36 Market corrections are not bad. They test those less invested in the long-term of crypto; those who remain, become stronger.

First few times it may cause panic but as you become accustomed to the corrections it becomes normal.

Stay patient!!

9829 2018-01-10 12:43:04 Fascinating that $ETH market cap is now almost double that of Ripple whereas last week Ripple surpassed the market cap of Ethereum. Shows that crypto is the wild west and is completely unpredictable.

9835 2018-01-10 12:42:28 What are you talking about? Read his tweets, he was riding the LTC bump during the trend breakout. That's the difference between him and you, you build your own truth based on bias, he goes after the facts.
9836 2018-01-10 12:42:22 You are shit 
9837 2018-01-10 12:42:21 oprah? of course not, crypto boss for president!!

9839 2018-01-10 12:42:13 In the manufacturing environment today, the ordering times between buyers and vendors is still a problem. Small to medium business can feel completely ignored at times.

Other than watching to see what $btc does today it looks like time to switch off for now.

その点BitClubでは，前の投資がBTCを生み出してくれます！

9896 2018-01-10 12:37:07 Alistair, I would encorage you(and others) be more supportive for other currencies in crytpospace(except rogue bcash :D) - we are so small yet, we should cheer sucesses but not envy and troll them. We should be united against FIAT and nor fight within crypto.
9897 2018-01-10 12:37:06 The butthurt from @kazonomics is real he's so annoyed he missed the boat he's clingling to bch and dumping on BTC LTC, constantly hating on the "OG" as he calls them

9905 2018-01-10 12:35:48 "better" is subjective. Mixing "tech development" with "financial markets" is what makes you lose money. You don't need to hold LTC to make it better. You bought it for the money ok? No need to lie here.

9914 2018-01-10 12:34:38 I think 'investors', or whatever you can someone that has no concern of fundamentals and think a market is a one way road with a fast lane, are focused more on what crypto they should add to their portfolio.

By the way for 'fun' you may want to review the option chain of $KODK.

9918 2018-01-10 12:34:29 Even if crypto currencies do not stick around, I think they have set a perception in new investors that will have a lasting effect. Stock markets, in particular, seem far less risky than they seemed before crypto.
9919 2018-01-10 12:34:29 $KODK used to be into pictures, film, cameras. They switched to crypto 2 days ago. Stock? +400% in those 2 days. Premarket trading above $12. Oh dear....

So exchanges cheating then, so why would be buy small coins

資金調達法の一つ。
「IPO」が新規に株式を発行して資金調達するのに対し、「ICO」の場合、独自に発行した通貨の「トークン」で資金調達する。

ICOは、IPOのように厳しい基準がないため、資金調達が容易に行いやすい反面、ICOが失敗する可能性もあり、投資家としてはハイリスクな一面も。
