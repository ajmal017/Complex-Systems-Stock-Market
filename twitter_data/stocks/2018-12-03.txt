If you wouldn’t put your money in a bad investment, why put your time in one? Unlike money, you can’t get time back.

Don’t make bad investments.

53 2018-12-03 23:32:41 Well, someone's stocks are about to fall.
54 2018-12-03 23:31:35 Stocks dropped because of unexpected 50 basis interest hike. one can get risk free returns of 10% now , they switch from stocks to fixed income. And negative market sentiments prevailed.

60 2018-12-03 23:28:01 Bank stocks were weak today while broad mkt rose. One reason is flattening of Treasury bond yield curve: short-term ylds are rising while longer-term ylds fall. Banks borrow short, lend long. Bank losers Mon:

61 2018-12-03 23:26:23 Was down 50% on this investment back in Feb'16, now up 50%+.

Amazing how the market and stocks in general work. Let's see if this is a double top or it can continue ramping higher from here...

63 2018-12-03 23:24:51 Known that "Wall Street's" memory span is 2 weeks. 
Recent bounce not surprising & amusing. Nothing really changed from when  stocks started their down fall. Rate outlooks same. Stocks still greatly overpriced. Ping Pong match continues. Corp earnings & outlooks same or lower.

66 2018-12-03 23:23:08 Is there data regarding mean game length on 2 stocks vs 3 stocks in smash 4? I’m guessing that 3 wasn’t proportionately longer than 2.
67 2018-12-03 23:21:23 Kid? I'm the one talking about stocks while you have a Spongebob character (right?) as your profile picture? Again, denial and all that..
68 2018-12-03 23:21:12 Something I dont see people talk about much is how important stock count is to how people play. People will be much more aggro on more stocks because screwing up doesn’t mean losing half the game like it sadly did in smash 4. So many cool moments likely lost to having 2 stocks :/
69 2018-12-03 23:20:20 GM was failing during Obama's reign of stupidity.  He bailed them out.  Wonder what types of cars their corporate leaders drive? GNP is UP. Employment across the board is UP. Stocks are steady. Yeah, Trump again in 2020.
70 2018-12-03 23:16:59 So on the fundamental side, December is the best month for stocks. We have a cooperative fed and a china trade deal in the back pocket. Does this not worry your analysis at all?

74 2018-12-03 23:14:09 Yeah last time cash was king was during the financial crises when if you had made stocks or property or just about anything else but cash king, you would have made a fortune.

82 2018-12-03 23:09:16 As @preempt1 has suggested Jim - I don’t think you quite grasp how it all works in a Bull Marjet. When the hype kicks in its game on for all stocks.

We haven’t even started yet. Companies like @aee_auraenergy - with a significant news flow that WILL be in production - will boom.
83 2018-12-03 23:08:53 I mean seriously you bought pot stocks they all went up, thats all you did
84 2018-12-03 23:08:38 Stocks were looking a bit thin in my local store tonight. Some great wines here.
85 2018-12-03 23:08:30 The spread between 2 and 10 year is 20 basis points and the spread between 2 and 5 year is nothing.  Stocks and real estate crashing is coming.  I have my 401k $ in the fixed interest rate account.

The greybeards will remember rumortrage circa Y2K when stories would move stocks and traders shot first and asked questions later.  Welp, the ready-fire-aim crowd is back and this time they’re armed w social media and killer algos.
97 2018-12-03 22:57:09 Stocks' gains of the last six days have some bulls dreaming of new highs. For Big Techs, here are gains needed to top old peaks:

$ADBE +8.8
$CRM +11.8
$INTC +14.9
$AMZN +15.6

103 2018-12-03 22:54:04 Especially when everything becomes hard to borrow, including stocks to short.
104 2018-12-03 22:54:00 What about - say October 3? Yields went higher and stocks fell. Sample correlation ~= true correlation, especially for small N. Even large N in fat-tailed land makes linear correlation unreliable. Terrible.

118 2018-12-03 22:43:12 Yeah, they could have easily taken down the bad stuff before it got this bad but were lazy. It is pretty great seeing all the stocks plummet tho!
119 2018-12-03 22:42:59 Sell those stocks while they're still worth a coffee. 
Sell your shares reeeal fast.
120 2018-12-03 22:42:57 I don’t know the perfect number but over 15 stocks is too many for me in my portfolio.  I can’t have more and give proper attention to each position daily.  I’d rather be more dense in my approach and know whats going on with everything I own then too diverse and clueless.

129 2018-12-03 22:37:08 Crashing is not the intended use of cars. Spraying as many rounds as possible, as quickly as possible, is the intended use of AR-15s, bump stocks and high capacity magazines. Again, the comparison fails.
130 2018-12-03 22:37:00 So the stock market is closing on the 5th Dec. Some stocks are doing poorly enough, a day break would just compound it. Another sell of coming soon. Might be in January. #Facts
131 2018-12-03 22:36:49 I think the idea was: Acquire Tumblr, get all these cool kids, then have them move to Yahoo once they get old enough to care about stocks or follow sports.
132 2018-12-03 22:36:37 One of the toughest stocks to Trade rather trade other Names
133 2018-12-03 22:36:15 Literally unbelievable that Sky Sports get these two in as experts. Says a lot about the decision making behind this programme. Both are laughing stocks who consistently get things wrong. Astounding.
134 2018-12-03 22:36:06 My stocks are up ^~^
135 2018-12-03 22:34:27 Yesterday - Industry: #DIVERSIFIED FINANCIALS was 34% Positive, with #HEALTH CARE EQUIPMENT & SERVICES 1% Positive. Stocks: $NVA was 31% Positive, with $SPX -1% Negative. #ASX
136 2018-12-03 22:34:13 For someone who doesn't even live in this country I fail to see what business is it of yours. I stand by my statement of we have to start somewhere, & if  somewhere is with banning bump stocks, then that's a good first step. Are you really that daft that you can't figure it out?
137 2018-12-03 22:34:06 Same here, but this all makes sense now seeing Cron sideways action or slightly up on red days for other pot stocks past month. Today was supposed to be a good day for MJ. Welp...back to the drawing board.

143 2018-12-03 22:33:58 I thought this said stocks for a minute and honestly kind of agreed with you...
144 2018-12-03 22:33:43 $NVLN This was on our Last Nights Sunday Stream for Stocks to Breakout this week!!!

$PTIE should be next IMO.

Hope everyone caught it! 
145 2018-12-03 22:33:11 With the market generally up today, value stocks that are counter-cyclical like $MCD $VZ and $JNJ were down. Great opportunity to buy discounted stocks that can be a safety net for future dips. Bought $VZ that was down 3.5% on the day. Great yield and upcoming 5G roll out.
146 2018-12-03 22:32:42 It's hilarious. They've just lost half their user base, and that's a low estimate. If they didn't belong to Yahoo I think the mass Exodus would severely hurt their stocks.
147 2018-12-03 22:31:39 @verizon @tumblr  Are both of you out of your minds? This new ‘guidelines’ are a huge mistake and you will know it when the website is in flames. Hope you like falling stocks <3
148 2018-12-03 22:31:29 D ailleur tropicale babe eux font « croire » que les stocks sont limités genre il va rester que deux articles mais enfait gros gros mitho
149 2018-12-03 22:31:14 $RGSE I'm kinda new and want to ask why would anyone stay long on stocks that don't pay dividends?
150 2018-12-03 22:30:09 Oh mon dieu

Si on peux avoir l'accès avec @Vertige__ avant que les stocks partent en fumée je vous fait toute la pub de la planète
151 2018-12-03 22:28:55 Wtf @littlecaesars store #1300 doesn’t even have your thin crust pizza, who stocks these stores.  Had to order @pizzahut #eww #gross
152 2018-12-03 22:26:55 Where's this dirtier water and air that Trump caused?
Do you actually think 400% tariffs on US Dairy into Canada is fair trade?
Do you actually think running $376 Billion (2016) in Chinese trade deficits helps our economy?
GDP, Employment, Jobs, Wages, Stocks, all up under Trump.
153 2018-12-03 22:25:59 @CCapricorn1 I've been intregued by your Betting Project. Have you tried it with stocks? (Thanks for posting...triggered lots of thoughts!)
154 2018-12-03 22:25:41 US stocks surge on news of trade cease-fire with China?
Trump is winning again
155 2018-12-03 22:25:21 Evening Market Wrap-up: stocks close higher amid US/China trade truce.
156 2018-12-03 22:24:48 TRUMP SURPASSES EASILY THE BEST PRESIDENT FOR MAKING TRADE DEALS! TODAY'S NEWS BLOWS THE DEMS OUT OF WATER WITH NO TARIFFS ON US CARS TO BE SOLD AND THAT IS GREAT NEWS FOR GM AND OTHERS! STOCKS ARE THRU THE ROOF! PRES TRUMP'S RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA IS A 1000% IMPROVEMENT!
157 2018-12-03 22:24:39 For some.....but this is no place to hash it out. BTW, we are a "socialist" country too in many ways like government handouts for huge corporations, tax breaks for the rich, tax incentives for the rich to buy stocks, etc. I guess socialism for some is okay.
158 2018-12-03 22:24:17 Stocks? Black/Hispanic unemployment? Gas prices?
159 2018-12-03 22:24:16 Fear creates its own self-fulfilling dynamic - as people give into it they lose energy and momentum. 

Lack of confidence turns into inaction.

It’s what holds people back from investing in stocks, shooting their shot, moving to a new place, starting that business.
160 2018-12-03 22:23:21 What's gonna be the NSFW Tumblr killer and how can I buy stocks in them.
161 2018-12-03 22:22:24 si, un aimbot  + 100% de top 1 sur toutes tes prochaines games + des v-bucks gratuits (dans la limite des stocks disponibles, offre soumise à condition)
162 2018-12-03 22:21:19 @RobinhoodApp Any chance the app team is looking at “notes” ie:being able to write a short note on stock view on stocks we own. :-)  imo would make a great app better.
163 2018-12-03 22:20:51 puts on stocks with williams r% >-.2 && hedge with vxx puts seems like a good strategy for 2018 in hindsight!
164 2018-12-03 22:20:47 I’ve heard that before.  800 hit.  Bye bye bump stocks.
165 2018-12-03 22:20:37 My boss said “you haven’t talked about your stocks in some time now even tho the market is rebounding, you must be doing really bad”...I told her nah I’m throwing a party that’s all it is.
166 2018-12-03 22:19:23 Trump predicts a 7% growth curve on wall street stocks with his china tariff charade. Come on Wally World! Do your primary benefactor proud and mask the real undercurrents behind latest market shifts!!!
167 2018-12-03 22:18:54 All the more reason to have commission free trades on single stocks as well!
168 2018-12-03 22:18:15 Excelの株式（Stocks）のショートカットキーはCtrl+Shift＋F2らしいです。
自分のExcelではまだ反映していません。
169 2018-12-03 22:17:57 cryptocurrency is like unregulated tech stocks but not really stocks cuz the coins can be used to buy things lol. Learn about bitcoin / blockchain / trading before attempting anything.
170 2018-12-03 22:17:56 Hahaha yeah I would always just forget to buy stocks in gta
171 2018-12-03 22:15:38 I know but still impressive how much flattening stocks can cope with
172 2018-12-03 22:13:42 Bump stocks, I think those should be illegal. I just know that gun control isn’t going to solve the issue. In my town of Oakland, gun violence is bad and we are in California. Look at Chicago too... there’s a lack of education and economic inequality that leads to violence
173 2018-12-03 22:13:35 les grands groupes industriels (Nestlé, Danone...) n'utilisent pas le recyclé et continuent à fabriquer  des emballages. Alors que les sociétés de recyclage entassent des stocks prêts à être réutilisés 
174 2018-12-03 22:12:55 I wonder what this NSFW purge is doing to Tumblr's stocks. Are they going up? Are they going down?
175 2018-12-03 22:12:25 This time last year I was feeling very smug about my Thomas Cook shares, bought at, let me check, a long way above today’s closing price. The perils of owning individual stocks...
176 2018-12-03 22:11:27 Same here! My whole family are bricks and mortar. Stocks are good too if you are ok with taking a risk, but a house is tangible in the moment. I'm nervous of investing in US property. Asia and UK I felt fine, but USA is so alien to me after only one year.
177 2018-12-03 22:11:22 We brought only a few decorations when we moved so need to start building our stocks again 
178 2018-12-03 22:10:45 It's even better:

Bulls: 
1. Strong US economy, earnings, growth 
2. Easy monetary conditions elsewhere, high ERP, good for stocks.

Bears:
1. High inflation in the US, peak earnings, higher rates will kill stocks.
2. Weak growth elsewhere, on verge of global recession, bearish.
179 2018-12-03 22:09:23 Is it bad that I look at my 401, stocks, IRAs, and all my other savings/ investment accounts every single day ?
180 2018-12-03 22:08:05 Saw the Attorney General confirm his part in contempt should indeed lead to his expulsion. Pure panto.
I'd like to see the whole bunch of 'em put in stocks for 12days (of Xmas of course).Schoolkids from all parts of precious union selected daily to administer peltings w/toms etc.
181 2018-12-03 22:07:47 Per USDA, 22.1% vs 20.3% in 17/18 and an avg of 18.7% over the last 5 years. That seems like a lot but keep in mind these numbers are using SAM stocks at the height of their season. So it is better to compare the relative difference rather than focus on the number itself.
182 2018-12-03 22:07:15 Goddammit I still haven't filled out my forms to trade US Stocks. I wanted to buy AMD at $20, now it's almost at $24. I HATE WAGE CUCKING
183 2018-12-03 22:06:38 Energy stocks surge as US crude oil jumps 4.3% to $53.14, betting that OPEC meet Thurs will result in production cuts. Mon. movers:

Marathon $MRO +5.2%
Anadarko $APC +4.9
$EOG +4.6
Conoco $COP +4.4
Exxon +2.2
Valero $VLO +1.8
Occidental $OXY +1.5
Chevron $CVX +1.4

S&P 500 +1.1
184 2018-12-03 22:06:31 High times is selling stocks  of its company at 11 dollars a shares .  Thought I should let y’all know .
185 2018-12-03 22:06:18 Everyone of them belong in hell! Bunch of lying cheating criminals! Follow the money, just look up the stocks they own!
186 2018-12-03 22:06:02 Inconsistency, thy name is tumblr.

So many people are losing advertising space.

How much do you suppose their stocks are going to plummet?
187 2018-12-03 22:05:57 Considering the user-traffic fell *after* these bans and not the App Store removal, I’m wagering now’s a good time to keep an eye on the stocks
188 2018-12-03 22:05:47 Mistake?  My arse.  The developer should be put in stocks and then made to plant 200 trees.
189 2018-12-03 22:04:55 Pot stocks feel Thailand, where you find surprises when you pull down their pants. Fuck the fuckers who fucked us. One more fuck and I am out of fucks.
190 2018-12-03 22:04:44 $NHPI .0134 - Nice six figure trade and counting for me. Thinking we see that .023 test in the next week or two. Jmo. #stocks #woodbrook #merger #analyst
191 2018-12-03 22:04:27 The Boeing Company (BA) price at close, 2018-12-03, is 359.99. #boeing #stocks #NYSE #space
192 2018-12-03 22:04:04 Tumblr stocks about to DROPPPP

194 2018-12-03 22:01:51 I wish I had bought stocks back when it was only 6 games / share!
195 2018-12-03 22:01:23 What is soya global stocks to use for 18/19 and how does that compare to historical avg?
196 2018-12-03 22:01:21 Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) price at close, 2018-12-03, is 358.49. #teslamotors #tesla #stocks #NASDAQ #elonmusk
197 2018-12-03 22:00:43 Bitch, stick to Smash 4, and losing by 4 stocks
198 2018-12-03 22:00:12 Stock drop: $BGCP and 10 other stocks drop. The Common Wealth is investigating! Reach out for more info. TheCommonWealth.mail@gmail.com #StockDrop #BGCP
199 2018-12-03 22:00:12 So with fed hiking does curve invert or do long rates rise?  Either scenario seems bad for stocks.
200 2018-12-03 22:00:03 Much of the recent stock market decline was the result of hedge funds selling stocks to raise cash to meet margin calls on their declining oil futures positions.

201 2018-12-03 21:59:44 I enjoy a friendly debate. Not sure about love (January) but there still appears to be an ample supply of lust for stocks. 2018 looks a lot like a topping pattern. Seems a good time to be cautious.
202 2018-12-03 21:59:40 Y'all need to be okay with stocks ending early. Not every stock is going to go to 150%.
203 2018-12-03 21:59:24 aah no need to worry i dont intend on closing my shop anytime soon! the small pins and the stickers are on unlimited and the rest is up for as long as i still have stocks so take your time
204 2018-12-03 21:59:00 At the moment, we unfortunately have a shortage of power supply cables and cannot offer them as spare parts until our stocks have returned, which might take a couple of months. It would be faster to swap the entire lightstrip, but the choice is up to you.
205 2018-12-03 21:58:10 Crowd is watching,  and bragging on calling the S&P,  while losing on their stock picks.  
  Try watching the universe of stocks,  many, many  of which are in bear markets.  
The S&P is not the stock market.
206 2018-12-03 21:58:08 Try looking at monthly or quarterly charts for a random pick of a hundred stocks.
207 2018-12-03 21:58:03 ... And? Stocks don't last long in this game. That's why we have a higher stock count.
208 2018-12-03 21:57:15 All is want for Christmas is a year’s subscription of @StocksToTrade 
209 2018-12-03 21:56:59 My husband and I just make 3 figures between the two of us and our taxes have went down! We are thrilled with the current economy! Stocks are up! If you can’t see that, you are not looking!
210 2018-12-03 21:56:15 i don’t either. Did you see the post going around that showed their stocks plummeting? 
211 2018-12-03 21:55:50 T’es sur ils vont pas nous la mettre à l’envers avec les stocks ?
212 2018-12-03 21:55:17 He getting into stocks?
213 2018-12-03 21:54:27 Matt the executive order on bump stocks is an example of the correct use of executive orders. He is not creating new law. He has extended existing laws against modification kits to cover bump stocks. Obama shoulda done it, he did the opposite.
214 2018-12-03 21:52:46 hm might need 4 stocks then... thatd be interesting
215 2018-12-03 21:52:25 The Attorney General himself confessed this was inevitable and he should, rightly, be expelled. Panto.
As for t'others? Stocks for May, BJ, Gove, Rudd, JR-M et al, for 12days of Xmas. Schoolkids from all parts of precious union selected daily to administer tomato&eggs pelting.
216 2018-12-03 21:51:07 That's funny... When my wife leaves town, she stocks the fridge and we have a half-hour tutorial. I of course, act shocked and offended...
217 2018-12-03 21:49:44 Anybody know anything about stocks
218 2018-12-03 21:49:41 Farsali unicorn tears...please bring it back in stocks 
219 2018-12-03 21:49:09 Stocks that moved substantially or traded heavily Monday:
220 2018-12-03 21:49:09 Stocks finished solidly higher on Wall Street Monday as investors welcomed news of a 90-day truce in the trade battle between the U.S. and China.
221 2018-12-03 21:47:31 Propose something that doesn’t include banning guns. Gun owners have approved changes to NICS, most are ok with banning bump stocks because they are useless, approve more robust mental health provisions etc. But you don’t want that. You want to ban guns and call names. Impasse.
222 2018-12-03 21:46:34 I saw a shot of Tumblr's stocks fucking plummeting and I would REALLY love to see Twitter's stocks by comparison since most of the ppl I've seen are jumping over here now
223 2018-12-03 21:46:03 Verizon Stocks Go Limp Without Titillation
224 2018-12-03 21:45:54 Stocks that moved substantially or traded heavily Monday:
225 2018-12-03 21:45:54 Stocks finished solidly higher on Wall Street Monday as investors welcomed news of a 90-day truce in the trade battle between the U.S. and China.
226 2018-12-03 21:45:25 World stocks in solid advance: US +1.1; Europe +1%. Stocks responded to the hope not the reality of US-China trade détente. If it doesn't materialize, markets will plunge. Lost in the euphoria is 2019 eps & GDP growth will be slower than 2018 but good enough for some price growth
227 2018-12-03 21:44:30 These guys are cracking me up. Like you can't call it a bubble and still be long stocks? Can you chew bubble gum and walk at the same time? LOL. Same morons said exact same thing to guys calling tech a bubble in '98. I think TSLA's trash but I rode it from 260-330. Called trading
228 2018-12-03 21:44:19 People lose everything due to stocks too if they’re going to play the game they have to quickly learn when to get in and when to get out ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ it was an obvious bubble when the majority of the people buying into it were only doing it as an investment not for its real purpose
229 2018-12-03 21:44:04  on t'oblige pas après.!! Gare aux ruptures de stocks 
230 2018-12-03 21:43:42 $TMO at $250 today. See, good companies dont get their stocks broken during a selloff. Study Thermo Fisher’s chart for last 8 weeks and you’ll see what a buying opportunity was the stock around $225
231 2018-12-03 21:43:19 If you had $5000 to put into stocks what would you buy
232 2018-12-03 21:43:10 at the coffee shop, trading stocks.
233 2018-12-03 21:42:47 What important to note is the assumptions behind the fairness opinion. Fairness is not defined and the comparable valuations in pot stocks are ridiculous that you can possibly justify any deal to be “fair”. With the right fees, anything can become fair.
234 2018-12-03 21:42:40 Tbh its a lot of mix ups and he still is doo doo but airdodge is pretty great. I was living 130-180 on most stocks. Up b having armor on start up helps alot.
235 2018-12-03 21:42:17 Stocks that moved substantially or traded heavily Monday:
236 2018-12-03 21:42:17 Stocks finished solidly higher on Wall Street Monday as investors welcomed news of a 90-day truce in the trade battle between the U.S. and China.
237 2018-12-03 21:40:57 Proof?  look at Bethesda's stocks.  Also, Elder Scrolls 6 and Fallout 5 will have the same damn bugs guaranteed and As far as Doom goes Bethesda only publishes that which they only get a % of the $$$
238 2018-12-03 21:40:44 Anything of value. The world will become tokenized so gold/stocks/bonds/property/crypto/FIAT... you name it. ILP will become the standard for interoperability, XRP will not capture the entire volume via the ILP but you can suspect it to obtain the lion share of the IOV

240 2018-12-03 21:39:51 African and Indian stocks
241 2018-12-03 21:39:43 Isn't that most stocks ?
242 2018-12-03 21:39:27 Sticking with the marijuana stock theme. I tend to buy blue chip stocks so it's a little weird to see a stock drop 6 points and go up 18 points in the same day. #volatility
243 2018-12-03 21:38:10 looks like verizon just took a dip in the stocks Oo at least from what i'm seeing RT onto my timeline.  (fyi they own tumblr)
244 2018-12-03 21:37:55 Ha! I don't remember telling you. My local newsagents stocks more stuff than the cash & carry. It sells the lot. I can't remember alize tho.
245 2018-12-03 21:37:45 Tech stocks soar, while my portfolio does not. The magic of $UGAZ 
246 2018-12-03 21:37:04 $DISCA, $DISCK, $ATVI, $HFC, and $TTWO are the top five stocks that closed lower today.
247 2018-12-03 21:36:47 Pornhub stocks are gonna soar
248 2018-12-03 21:36:16 $NHPI #WEALTH
249 2018-12-03 21:36:09 $AMD, $WYNN, $TWTR, $EL, and $DVN are the top five stocks that closed higher.
250 2018-12-03 21:36:05 so china stocks didn't rally per crowd expectations LOL
251 2018-12-03 21:35:40 Considering their stocks made a meteoric plummet when they announced the full NSFW ban, they -might-. Or they might just let the site die.
252 2018-12-03 21:35:03 $AMD, $GE, $F, $BAC, and $T were the top five most active stocks today.
253 2018-12-03 21:34:20 $MLNX and $AAPL are the big winners today. I did not expect MLNX to continue to grow after their shares jumped, but they continue to prove me wrong. Now approaching $100/share after being about $70 near the end of October. Big gains! #investing #stocks #MLNX $FANG $FAANG
254 2018-12-03 21:32:45 Maybe a hangover day today for Aussie stocks. They did drink a little too much yesterday.
255 2018-12-03 21:31:53 There will not be a significant, long term top in US markets until the public is head over heels in love with stocks. 

A blow off top. Investor euphoria. That's the nature of market psychology. 

Likely years away. Certainly nowhere near that now.

258 2018-12-03 21:28:52 man my month away on holiday break was something else. 
now let me catch back up to speed on my crypto stocks, check out some new tumblr posts, and enjoy it all with a nice salad.
259 2018-12-03 21:27:48 Still green :) !
260 2018-12-03 21:27:29 People (ie @CNBC @business ) are gushing over stocks... explain to me why the 2s10s treasury spread is collapsing if all is well in the world?!
261 2018-12-03 21:27:25 I save $1s to invest into Crypto/stocks. Although i only have crypto at the moment
262 2018-12-03 21:26:45 Didnt people say Smash 4 was too slow but then people figured out the game and it got faster? I feel like we’re probably pushing for 4 stocks tbh.
263 2018-12-03 21:26:37 What do you think about 4 stocks for doubles?
264 2018-12-03 21:25:32 god i really hope they change their mind after seeing stocks and backlash but i doubt it the site's been dying for years especially since they made half the dash advertisements
265 2018-12-03 21:24:58 some stocks report late and depending on the flow, most folks just forget about it..  $RH
266 2018-12-03 21:24:55 The 3 publicly traded CRISPR stocks are $EDIT $NTLA and $CRSP. Editas has won the early patent disputes with NTLA so has the potential of a royalty payment or settlement from the others once appeals have run their course.
267 2018-12-03 21:24:22 Penny stocks may not exist anymore in 2050, will be replaced by security crypto assets under regulation I feel.

273 2018-12-03 21:22:22 Hello, mga Kapitbahay! Alam namin na naiinip na kayo... kami din! 

Our apologies for the delay. Due to a lot of different factors na hindi namin kontrolado, we are experiencing some delays sa pagdating ng stocks na para sa inyo. 

Please check our page often for updates!

274 2018-12-03 21:20:53 They don’t though - it’s the same storyline, 8 times! Ian Beale’s trying to hit on his ex wife! Mo is being overprotective of her alcohol stocks! Nothing’s changed!?
275 2018-12-03 21:20:11 Does you trading style fit penny stocks trading? I would think it’s the same because it’s all about the chat and human behavior.
276 2018-12-03 21:19:55 The only thing about that is bump stocks are around are because of anti gunners
277 2018-12-03 21:19:37 De façon amusante d'ailleurs. Je me suis permis d'aller la page de @PorcherThomas qui affiche IS LM en photo de couverture.
J'imagine qu'il doit trouver ça suffisant pour flamber, mais surtout IS LM est caduque. Comparant flux et stocks, ex ante et ex post. Dommage

279 2018-12-03 21:19:13 Guys - move on - things will never change in my erstwhile country. Massive night on Wall Street - esp with some of the stocks that have been hit - amazon up 4% - my favourite AMD up 11%
280 2018-12-03 21:18:59 bump stocks are out, new bump barrels are the next big thing
the barrels absorb the recoil
281 2018-12-03 21:17:46 No idea, after the first bounce and then retracement, all bets are off. Could break to new lows, could rally sharply. Good stocks are still better than bonds. I'm still pretty much in gold, utilities & cash, and nibbling at some energies. Giving some love to the unloved.  :)
282 2018-12-03 21:17:46 If we want to advocate for ethical and sharia-compliant investing, let's discuss criteria to evaluate whether a stock is halal or a list of recommended stocks with a grading system. I would love to work together on that. But 'market movement alerts' is not the model for it.
283 2018-12-03 21:17:27 These good news just make cash flow to other stocks
284 2018-12-03 21:17:03 It’s great deal for the country. I wish it was done years ago it would be helpful to narrow the nation’s debt that is claiming everyday. Keep the stocks gain upward!!
285 2018-12-03 21:16:13 I buy stocks and don’t know how to act. Sometimes my job makes it so fucking hard to leave them.
286 2018-12-03 21:15:59 The @NYSE jumped today. 
DJI
25,826.43
+287.97 (1.13%)
But it's because investors think #Trump & #Xi have settled their differences & US/China trade will smooth out. As soon as that proves wrong, the markets will plummet again.
Stocks aren't for the feint of heart in Trump-time.
287 2018-12-03 21:15:48 BREAKING NEWS: Dumbass devs of tumblr make a stupid decision which incorrectly tags many posts on the site and results in their stocks dropping harder than frozen concrete pipes on a Tuesday. More at 6.
288 2018-12-03 21:14:49 Someone like @StockTwits should run a live Market Cap tracker for $AMZN, $AAPL and $MSFT like the TSeries vs pewdiepie on YouTube and people chatting about these stocks in real time with some dope music in background. You can run ads to pay for costs. What do you think?
289 2018-12-03 21:14:23 Stocks rally broadly, but off early highs for the day, as US and China pledge trade truce.

Dow ends +288, +1.1% to 25,836, highest close since Nov 9. Nasdaq +1.5%, S&P +1.1%, both to highest since Nov 8.

Crude oil jumps 4.5% to $53.20 on production-cut hopes.
290 2018-12-03 21:14:23 If you diversified your car stocks when the car was made you'd turn $100 to $4

... Airplane stocks you'd turn $100 to $3

... Internet stocks you'd turn $100 to $5

Diversification is the historically dumbest move an investor can make in every groundbreaking invention there was.

296 2018-12-03 21:11:28 The incongruity of stocks going up; 10 year hitting 2.98%; everything for sale is being  offered at big discounts; economy is slowing faster than most think; stocks have to go lower.

300 2018-12-03 21:10:13 Buying stocks is the hardest purchase to make because I don’t get anything physical back. If all goes well tho 30 year old Amro gon love today’s Amro when it’s time to cash out.
301 2018-12-03 21:10:02 I agree on your view and i’m still bearish on this market. Gap ups and chip sector stocks moving up 11% on no news is only a great way to enter a short / puts.
302 2018-12-03 21:09:55 Investofy's video promotes this type of behavior - sending an alert to buy CALM at $39.95 with a sell limit order. This reeks of a pump and dump model. All this is doing is taking the existing trade-follower industry and making sure they are doing so with sharia-compliant stocks
303 2018-12-03 21:09:32 Speaking of laughing stocks...
304 2018-12-03 21:08:28 honestly two things will go down with tumblr
1) they actually enforce that shit and end up losing a large portion of their user base, their stocks will fall, and then they'll revert the changes 
OR 2) nothing actually happens cause tumblr cant enforce for SHIT
305 2018-12-03 21:07:59 Should start looking up stocks 
306 2018-12-03 21:07:55 US #stocks close with broad gains following Trump-Xi Trade Talk Truce, OPEC-Russia production cuts, and strong ISM data

307 2018-12-03 21:07:49 And the rich get richer off they’re stocks.
308 2018-12-03 21:05:51 ironic that an 'investment analyst' doesn't realize the value of data in baseball. let me guess, you pick stocks on a 'gut feeling,' your wife weighs 3 bills, so you take out your feelings of inadequacy through sports?
309 2018-12-03 21:05:23 If the #market comes out of a correction, you can chase a little bit. But do not chase #stocks which are >5-10% above their break out levels or are up >10% in a row.

315 2018-12-03 21:03:00 It's said that FX markets tend to be more trending.

You're right about stocks (value and growth stocks) having an upward bias (until they crash!). This is because of value,growth and inflation factors. Currencies tend to move through cycles.

Talent contest is nonsense.We lose Eu career and lifestyle opportunities.
325 2018-12-03 20:57:46 Something to consider is US stocks may be rallying today moreso due to falling int rates, especially at the long end, than for anything related to the fed or G20...The early morning G20 fade was real, but that was eclipsed by falling int rates. Just my take....
326 2018-12-03 20:57:25 I bet after this goes into effect, there’s gonna be a massive amount of people deleting their accounts and lost money/plummeting stocks for tumblr and they’re gonna come back a week later like oops lol jk we’re gonna allow nsfw content again 
327 2018-12-03 20:56:36 Last week was great! It rained in Greater Los Angeles and the stock market ended the week positive. There's rain again in the forecast starting tomorrow and today stocks are rallying as a trade détente is reached between U.S. & China. As Ice Cube says, Let it Rain make it bang!

336 2018-12-03 20:53:50 Well for sure, we all suffer the occassional profits warning/bad news; just part of the territory. A few stocks did keep me awake a touch in 2001 but by 2008, I reckon I had learnt a bit; you cant really put a price on sleep & health.

344 2018-12-03 20:48:50 Oh man. That's not my view though. There's evidence that TA works in stocks. Eg, momo is a TA strategy in essence. 

IMO, applying this to fixed income is far less valuable.
345 2018-12-03 20:48:32 Yep, they basically use mental gymnastics to make themselves look smarter. But they end up looking like fools, and become laughing stocks instead.

352 2018-12-03 20:46:19 I am not saying to quit your job, I am saying look at the ways to generate passive income. And no I don’t mean investing in stocks, 401K, or crypto.

386 2018-12-03 20:28:54 US markets are absolutely killing the #TSX, particularly the last few days. All big Canadian sectors are getting no respect: Great bank earnings shrugged off, nobody cares but mines, and oil stocks are not talked about in polite company. Today, interest sensitives getting whacked
387 2018-12-03 20:28:34 not a big fan of steel stocks right now.... personally, I'd avoid this sector right now
388 2018-12-03 20:26:25 But owning all the stocks != "full ownership of the firm." You are just bearing all the equity risk and doing all the board monitoring, no more and no less. The scenarios of going private, or making yourself CEOs, aren't relevant since you are no longer a shareholder then.
389 2018-12-03 20:21:32 I just wanted to know the moment at which shareholders "pay" CEOs. I have some stocks in a 401(k). Will I need to put some of my paycheck aside so I can pay the CEOs? I thought I was just being compensated for bearing equity risk and monitoring, now I have to pay employees too!?!
390 2018-12-03 20:21:17 im with  3 stocks 8 mins as a tester then going from there in terms of reduction.
391 2018-12-03 20:20:18 Imagine the riots in #france over taxes and cost of living but imagine it in america where we have more guns than pets...(tgj) #cnbc #qeinfinity @NationalGuard #CNBC #wshh #nasdaq #stocks #money #wsj #HedgeFund #FederalReserve
392 2018-12-03 20:20:16 @NRA I don’t own bump stocks but if you guys don’t sue over making people who do instant felons... I won’t be renewing what is sad we literally had more freedom with @BarackObama trying to take it vs bs now @realDonaldTrump needs to make pro gun laws he hasn’t
393 2018-12-03 20:18:19 so from the beginning of the year i have currently lost 3000 in stocks lmaooo. But best believe imma make it all back and triple it in 2019 $$$
394 2018-12-03 20:17:12 but the gaming stocks still f...weak..whats the problem?
395 2018-12-03 20:16:43 Why are  stocks Disney, CBS, MSGN down in up market today?
396 2018-12-03 20:16:25 fifty refurbished and upgraded battle tanks can be a game changer in this war. If the govt reach out, there are many nations who will be glad to give, lease or sell from their stocks. We are dealing with battle hardened jihadists who have zero value for their lives.
397 2018-12-03 20:14:17 I bet you are long on many stocks in hoping they get a pump & dump bounce
398 2018-12-03 20:12:56 Fuck tumblr, good to hear their stocks have tanked though due to it.
399 2018-12-03 20:12:34 You can't control all your thoughts but you can control what you do with them
400 2018-12-03 20:09:44 bond market signaling recession inversion in U.S. Treasury yields for the first time since 2007 right before credit crisis...bank stocks look weak as well as housing gold looks strong and ready to break through $1250 $gld $gdxj $bac $c $xlf
401 2018-12-03 20:09:35 Gonna share some stocks with insider buying since October.

I keep coding,debugging and improving ExSan Portfolio,I have good results implementing Hedging,I use Yahoo Finance daily stock Data since Jan 1 2000
275 data file stocks are used to simulate HFT market,random access, random speed,random stocks, so far very satisfied

405 2018-12-03 20:07:29 Historically Gold/gold stocks usually bottom soon after last Fed hike in cycle. The bull begins & roars when the market sniffs out rate cuts. Key distinction here. $GLd $GDX $GDXJ $SLV
406 2018-12-03 20:07:18 It isn't fake, but it IS 100% irresponsible. The good news, however, is that NRA-TV is losing money and just had to lay off staffers. The NRA has lost millions and gun stocks are down.
407 2018-12-03 20:07:00 That’s not web traffic? Wtf. That’s stocks.
408 2018-12-03 20:06:09 For the hoes in btc still here. We haven’t hardly begun. If you have anything left burry it so hard and watch it unfold when we open historical bear stocks come 2019
409 2018-12-03 20:06:04 I’ve got a watch list of stocks I trade and watch for other stocks with news. As for which way they go, that’s it, take an educated guess and make sure you have a real tight stop loss. Volatility is huge at the open
410 2018-12-03 20:05:31 Crypto is a millennials generation of investing tools.  Many more millennials are/have bought crypto than they would have stocks.  Take the good with the bad.
411 2018-12-03 20:05:13 @MSNBC @ABCPolitics @BreitbartNews   Yep and the stocks are up high again! the president is making great trade agreement with China! what a great president! but CNN wouldn't know that they're too busy dumbing-down America! Baba black sheep!
412 2018-12-03 20:04:45 Well, I always say that if you feel the slightest bit uncomfortable with a stock, especially after doing a bit if diging, then it;s time to move on. Simply plenty of quality stocks as alternatives.

422 2018-12-03 19:57:37 A huge opening gap this morning which made chasing new entries more difficult  today though select high beta stocks are looking positive.

427 2018-12-03 19:54:23 Hey, @realDonaldTrump. Watch out. Pooty is said to be investing in poison industry stocks. You might want to start using Mar-lago staff as food tasters.
428 2018-12-03 19:54:23 Because someway, somehow The Donald is making money off of this. Somewhere there are oil stocks, somewhere he owns land there. Somewhere.

435 2018-12-03 19:49:44 Lots of oil and gas stocks selling below net asset value or below reserves amount. I made a ton of money back in 2002-2003 buying small cap Oil- Gas stocks selling at a discount to their reserves bc you get a free ride up when Oil goes back up in price, which it always does.
436 2018-12-03 19:49:02 Wall Street says this is the BEST time to buy stocks...
437 2018-12-03 19:48:58 @Tejj they are growth stocks not value so there’s a big difference.

457 2018-12-03 19:42:10 See the stocks drop and them suddenly reinstate it.
Still, even with the ban I'll probably be followed by porn bots somehow. 
458 2018-12-03 19:41:36 Great video man. Awesome work. Yes the all stocks were up but you were correct about that amzn purchase on Friday. No doubt it would have hit targets this week without news. Good job making money to anyone who got in on that. I’ll be in the next one !!
459 2018-12-03 19:40:44 Stocks rose on Wall Street today after President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China reached a truce in the countries’ trade war.
But given the issues that remain unresolved between China and the United States, investor enthusiasm may be fleeting.

470 2018-12-03 19:37:40 Taupe haha 

Malheureusement les stocks et les collections changent tout le temps, c'est risqué. T'as demandé à une vendeuse si ils y en avaient pas en stock ?
471 2018-12-03 19:37:22 Keep telling yourself that. In the end though, all that matters is SALES and STOCKS which are both beyond fucked. You know that I'm right (and so does both EA and DICE), but if you can live in denial for another year, well, be my guest I suppose..
472 2018-12-03 19:36:51 Nothing. Didn’t you read the #Fund facts??

486 2018-12-03 19:29:49 It's to discourage bulk-buying so that stocks last. Some people like to cover the walls of their house with jigsaws. That wouldn't do, would it?
487 2018-12-03 19:29:12 Funny how fast stocks brokers and financial advisors pivot to the hottest trends. I now see a tons of brokers-advisors saying they’re millennial investing experts. 
I would run from anyone who claims to be a millennial investment advisor.
488 2018-12-03 19:29:10 You can, sure.  It's more difficult, and bump stocks make it trivially easy.  As far as the point, it's arguable NFA already bans them.  @POTUS isn't writing new law, he's enforcing existing law which Obama unaccountably didn't.

510 2018-12-03 19:17:17 SELL THE RALLY?  Stocks rallied 5% in the last 6 days breaking through resistance.  But the market is currently over-bought and may pull back,  Long-term, the market is scary.  We have HUGE BUDGET DEFICITS and damaged trading partner relations with the rest of the world.
511 2018-12-03 19:16:14 @elonmusk it’s time for Tesla stocks to split. It would reduce the the negative news by short betting and allow expansion of the great technological change. Time for gas to be put where it belongs. In the past.

522 2018-12-03 19:11:00 Lying better than a rug here. Sad that the @GOP falsified the  uptick with the stock market with the Trump / Xi meeting. Companies  and their shareholders now depend on Trump for the stocks to rise in price rather than their 10-Q is laughable...

I want to trade stocks but I think the stock market is a little different, for what I can see is much more trendy and with a upside bias. Is it true?

600 2018-12-03 18:34:35 To be fair, they also havent fallen as much. Stocks like Trican and Step have $11 oil and $0.50 AECO priced into them for Q4 and Q1. I think improvement in differentials will at least allow customers to keep much of their planned status quos.
601 2018-12-03 18:34:24 U.S. stocks were soaring higher this morning after President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to hold off on new tariffs. The S&P 500's best week in seven years. Oil surged 5 %

604 2018-12-03 18:32:29 I think you have a good argument. Clearly the flattening we have seen is significant, and crude is signaling something significant certainly. In fact, its possible the USDCNH is signaling just that, a pricing out of the Dec hike. Stocks should see bloodshed soon if so....

742 2018-12-03 17:37:38 A bottom-up investing approach focuses on the analysis of individual stocks. In bottom-up investing, therefore, the investor focuses his or her attention on a specific company rather than on the industry in which that company operates, or on the economy as a whole.
743 2018-12-03 17:37:36 Looks like there may have been some irrational exuberance over the Trump-Xi trade war truce. Stocks well of highs of the day as all issues still exist and China has NOT confirmed Trumps claims of reduced auto tariffs. #trump #economy #tradewar #china #stockmarket
744 2018-12-03 17:37:33 In today’s economy...

Trump said in a tweet that China had agreed to cut import tariffs on American-made cars, sending stocks of automakers surging. The move, if realized, would bolster U.S. carmakers who were hit hard when China ramped up levies.

780 2018-12-03 17:21:18 Recent choppy trading in US stocks has revived a yearslong debate: Are the best days of the US bull market over, and should investors pivot to cheaper shares overseas?..
781 2018-12-03 17:21:06 Awesome !!
782 2018-12-03 17:20:19 I agree he should go to jail just as long as you do for the crimes he helped Trump commit. I say to the stocks for the other crimes he did for himself while doing crimes for you. Do you even know the words that are coming out of your mouth?
783 2018-12-03 17:20:12 If that were true penny stocks and futures markets manipulating spots would not exist. Anyone knows that SEC mouth is already so full of BS.
784 2018-12-03 17:18:38 Stocks up today

786 2018-12-03 17:17:11 Stocks are higher. And the calendar now says December. Unsurprisingly, I'm getting a lot of research notes and seeing a lot of stories about how this is the Santa Claus rally. Ho ho ho! Or no no no?
787 2018-12-03 17:17:06 For those that complain about these short attacks and how they can do it, you should be equally concerned about the "unnamed"  and "sources say" rumours of deals or buyouts we have also seen plague cannabis stocks. 

Both the bulls and bears use these tools. #BlueHorseShoe

790 2018-12-03 17:13:30 Oof! Blloodbath for Canadian pot stock Aphria after short seller Gabriel Grego calls it a black hole. $APHA down nearly 20%. But other cannabis stocks shrugging this off. $CGC $CRON $ACB $TLRY all higher.
791 2018-12-03 17:13:19 But isn't the reason stocks had slumped the fact Trump had imposed the increased tariffs? So Trump creates the problem, finally backs down because it's obvious his tariffs are hurting the US, and we praise him from r resolving the issue. God, we are idiots!

906 2018-12-03 16:25:38 FOMO Short squeeze was the root cause of Friday's divergence.

Most shorted stocks got squeezed higher, but can't make new highs, and value stocks got smashed making tons of new lows,

973 2018-12-03 16:00:41 A positive meeting between US and China brings a 90day hold on any tariffs. Stocks are rallying on the news, but it hasn’t hurt the bond pricing as they are moving slightly better also
974 2018-12-03 16:00:38 She has all the potential to be top tier. But I do think she should start the round with her stocks.
975 2018-12-03 16:00:10 Sort of missing the point that current stock patterns are based on historical data & the change in the trend will lead the change in stocks.

982 2018-12-03 15:56:15 #December has historically been a good month for #stocks.  instead of being complacent and starting the holidays early, we will remain vigilant and continue to focus on the economic fundamentals rather than letting dramatic headlines sway our long-term goals.
983 2018-12-03 15:55:43 What a difference a meeting makes. With China tariffs on hold, stocks gapped higher. Now, technicians talk about "filling the gap," but momentum could carry equities appreciably higher if retail numbers show year-over-year gains.  As I predicted, it's about food and energy sales.
984 2018-12-03 15:55:40 Total bargain & due a decent rebound any time - I think it's v easily possible to see a decent Santa rally & in stocks that have lagged playing catch up as people take profits from winners & recycle etc

1129 2018-12-03 14:52:39 Last time I checked, bump stocks are not mentioned in the 2nd Amendment. There are plenty of other arms to choose from. 
1130 2018-12-03 14:52:00 Stocks will go lower but the more they are disconnected from reality the more shocking drop is coming...
1131 2018-12-03 14:51:46 $AAPL Lots of stocks opened up high and fell like Apple. Not the action you want to see if Bullish.
1132 2018-12-03 14:51:35 This tea though. And they keep bringing up the music video (which was thrown together very last minute by the way) but that's it their clothes are sponsored so YGE doesn't have to pay for it. YGE very cheap when it comes to BP. Compared to BP literally raising their stocks
1133 2018-12-03 14:51:24 Volatility targeting funds sell stocks when volatility increases and we've observed it as more of a driver of price action since more are doing it.
1134 2018-12-03 14:51:08 Stocks up this morning strong enough to hit stops on the half hedges. At this point TREND STILL DOWN, with HALF HEDGES IN PLACE. Starting to bust out of the top side of the range if it can carry through. Taking on a bit more risk and enjoying the ride.
1135 2018-12-03 14:50:35 SGX is a failure...only attracts rubbish stocks that goes suspended or bust or illiquid after  1 year....

1142 2018-12-03 14:47:22 In order to create a protracted (10+ year) decline in stocks what would be the ideal precondition for investors ? Don’t sell in any decline. Hang on for the inevitable advance. They hold all the way down. Then they sell out in the dullness.

1144 2018-12-03 14:46:44 I can't tell you when to sell for stocks. I don't have crystal ball. If the price is close to your desire target I would say sell some and set the other stop loss above your breakeven price ( include commission) & don't look back

1162 2018-12-03 14:40:11 Many of the fears in the market and tech is built around the concept of a nasty trade war. It’s too early to say it’s over but this is a definite improvement any way you spin it. And if we can get some resolution. Stocks are looking good with a dovish fed. #china #TradeWars
1163 2018-12-03 14:40:07 Always rescue the bubble. Welfare for the wealthy lives on. Pump stocks, suppress wages.
1164 2018-12-03 14:39:55 If you are holding 50+ stocks you (think you) can ignore, and be an ostrich. If a focused 10 or using leverage then the pain will get to you in the end. Outliers teach you bad habits .. but never underestimate luck in this game.
1165 2018-12-03 14:39:49 Stocks up with China trade war paused.  This should open the door for stocks to move up toward new highs.
1166 2018-12-03 14:39:43 Stocks are doing the rally cause Trump can not keep his promise of allowing other countries to rip US off and the investors do not care, they only care about money and being Americans is pretty low not supporting US knowing We are being ripped off by all these other countries.

1187 2018-12-03 14:36:07 Do stocks care about big drops in #oil? Maybe not.

Oil down 22% in November, yet S&P 500 up 1.8% for the month.

In fact, since '83 (using reliable oil data) there have now been 8 months that saw oil down 20% or more.

The S&P 500 gained 7 of those months.

1207 2018-12-03 14:25:44 Thanks. The carry cost may be good for put of those leveraged ETF shorts in long term. Maybe less risky than holding individual small/medium biotech stocks. How do you think? I never traded those ETF, but traded a lot volatility using VXX. Maybe $LABD is better than $VXX?!

1211 2018-12-03 14:24:01 Stocks with those high ratios can be investigated to find out why there was high volume. Often useful information is found. Its not an indicator for making trades.

1213 2018-12-03 14:23:49 All the trade hoopla over #SOYBEANS doesn’t change the fact that a deal won’t effect massive global stocks of 995M bushels & record stocks/use ratio. Plus huge BZ crop on tap. #WHEAT looks much more interesting; where cash differentials have been extremely strong.

1217 2018-12-03 14:21:23 There will be huge gains in the stock market today. I think I understand how it works. Correct me if I’m wrong. 

If stocks rise, I have to give Obama credit?

If stocks decline, its Trump’s fault?

I think I got it! 
1218 2018-12-03 14:20:11 Stocks will soar today  and his family and close friends will make millions on equities they bought cheap. Tomorrow,  Donald will tweet, and the cycle will start again.

1226 2018-12-03 14:16:42 I suspect he profits off the stocks affected by these faux crises, as well.
1227 2018-12-03 14:16:13 yes. Should NDA filed and FDA approved, $CLSD should at least double. Why give up below cash value? This is one of the safest stock now even worst happens: FDA reject NDA. Jan is good time for the tiny biotech stocks to surge after ferocious tax loss selling.
1228 2018-12-03 14:15:55 Things I am thinking about:

1. December is a strong month for stocks.
2. Portfolio managers will be jumping on this move and will likely push stocks much higher.
3. Shopping activity seems pretty good.
4. You can focus on being right, or on making money.  Choose one.

Trump gives the 1% billions in tax cuts. They buy back stocks. Raise prices of goods & services. More profit for them, less money for you.

What's more important, having a plan going into a day or a few stocks you have to trade?

For me, always the plan.  So many names out there today, easy to get overwhelmed.  Have a firm plan and let the market filter the names to you.  It will happen.

1392 2018-12-03 13:01:21 What amazes me is when I meet young people and they ask me about how they should invest. Many are fearful. 

If you are young with decades till retirement, it's wise to be fully invested in stocks.
1393 2018-12-03 13:01:04 401ks limit your options on what stock you buy. If you want any form of growth, it comes with higher risk of loss.

That said, everything took a huge nosedive in the 2008 recession. Huge.

So paying into an HSA via stocks is a volatile choice if you aren't made of money.

1422 2018-12-03 12:44:21 Wouldn't want to have a short position in most stocks today. But that's what you risk when your main objective is to bring down something, instead of supporting and investing in what you believe will grow. Karma is a bitch and the more the better.

1545 2018-12-03 11:12:24 A weak currency due to overprinting of money, low taxation, low exports and low foreign inflows has led to devaluation of the currency. Devaluation has forced government to raise interest rates   which has in turn sent stocks downwards.
1546 2018-12-03 11:10:34 Should Short on Commodity & go Long on Stocks. It makes sense...

1548 2018-12-03 11:08:30 Just a note - if your Phalloidin is dissolved in MeOH, too little dilution might cause the MeOH to denature the phalloidin binding site in actin - I started to make highly concentrated stocks for SIM to avoid this.

1550 2018-12-03 11:06:57 Trade War Truse: If we can get a rally in stocks the 2,815 level on the S&P is key. Just as the panic and fear that we saw in Oct & Nov were not
justified, chasing stocks in the expected early week rally isn't prudent either. So be patient.
1551 2018-12-03 11:06:27 Yep, the premarket on a number of key stocks are up anywhere between 3-6%. My guess is a 750 point rally the DJI today

1590 2018-12-03 10:32:17 Hon, if indeed $10m worth of fuel is pumped daily, there wouldn't be queues. Why are you not arresting those witholding stocks, if anyone is doing so.  Why is Govt taking a laissez faire approach to the crisis.  Min Gumbo is always assuring us of adequate stocks. Is he OK?
1591 2018-12-03 10:29:56 Auto stock effect, then some dispersion trading, namely sell options on index and buy individual stocks options. That way you exploit differences between implied and realized volatility

1593 2018-12-03 10:29:17 Trump capitulation on tariffs shows his worry over stocks,  simple he could not take a stock crash on his watch , so the bullying of Powell and back off on tariffs buys him time. As he can then spout big stock market in history ... the problem he cant stop it!

1635 2018-12-03 09:56:28 Our Consensio trading technique will quickly begin reducing cash in the coming days in US stocks. It is important to let that happen in a controlled, disciplined fashion. The tendency to assume market direction, rather than wait for evidence, can be seductive.

1640 2018-12-03 09:51:58 Stock market futures indicate the year-end rally is beginning. Technically, this couldn’t be happening at a better time. Most indices held above February lows, barely. The possibility is growing that US stocks are on their way to new all time highs.
1641 2018-12-03 09:51:19 Nifty likely to swing in 10,650-10,960 range; 2 footwear stocks that could return up to 39%:

1833 2018-12-03 06:31:19 Well, to be perfectly honest, although we're very happy about the €100k milestone, we're focused more on increasing our passive income stream, too. However, it certainly doesn't hurt to have invested more  in stocks.
1834 2018-12-03 06:30:51 Invest smartly, when everyone was down on tech stocks buy it, yeah people are going to laugh at $FB, $AMZN lol plus heap up on dividend stocks as protection, I am already 9% total during the downtrend, once it opens
1835 2018-12-03 06:30:28 So what part of that payback agreement was disingenuous? Esp considering Feds agreed with it & accepted it as paid in full?

1843 2018-12-03 06:24:20 They paid back with unused Tarp $ that was in escrow and stocks. Now the feds chose to sell those stocks before they rebounded. That wasn't GM's fault that the FEDS agreed to those terms of Stocks/partial ownership.

1922 2018-12-03 05:21:08 I have long term holds, but my long terms holds are usually different from the stocks I trade. I mainly am a long term investor but pot stocks have no smart comps or algos so they’re incredibly easy trades to predict. So I make a few swing trades when I see fit.

1947 2018-12-03 04:59:19 As an addendum to something I Tweeted earlier, apparently Trump and China are only freezing the tariffs for now (which Trump desperately needs since stocks are plummeting) and they'll go back in action later if they can't come to a deal. "Mr. Deals" is held over a barrel. #resist

1961 2018-12-03 04:52:08 I completely agree  And that’s why I personally wouldn’t pay more than $8-$10 a share for many of these pot stocks at THIS stage. That might seem weird, but it’s about the amount of risk I’M personally willing to take.

2014 2018-12-03 04:23:28 A friend of mine lost a lot of money in stocks this month, said he would never accept 2% annual interest from a bank. I said "heck, I made 15% keeping my money in the bank this month." He said "impossible". I said "versus S&P, I'm up 15% in the last month. That's real money!"
2015 2018-12-03 04:20:12 So has everyone else? Yes people were speculating on the like penny stocks - but even projects that met their goals and released products on time that work well - the tokens they used to raise money are worthless because they all can use eth instead.
2016 2018-12-03 04:20:01 US and China trade deal is done, no default from NBFCs, Oil is down and interest rate outlook has  turned positive. How things change for good in just a few weeks. Expecting another positive market response.

2017 2018-12-03 04:20:00 Trump during his campaign:  We need to secure our southern border!   We’re gonna get a BIG BEAUTIFUL WALL and MEXICO is gonna PAY FOR IT. 

Trump now:  Y’all hear something?  PS Bump Stocks are banned
2018 2018-12-03 04:16:55 Glad my stocks will likely be rising for a while, but I don’t believe a 90 day moratorium on tariff hikes and some stopgap trading solves the US-China trade imbalance.

@hm, you have a problem. #hm
2048 2018-12-03 03:56:44 So, @Costco stopped shelving my coffee, probably because it’s cold brew and winter, but in California it’s still warm. At least @Target knows what’s up and still stocks it. #themvp
2049 2018-12-03 03:56:39 84% of stocks owned by the wealthiest 10% of Americans. So essentially, a stock market crash is just a bunch of old white dudes cashing out at the expense of everyone else.
2050 2018-12-03 03:55:28 You cant rely on the state to help when you are older. It is very likely that our generation will end in old-age poverty.

2070 2018-12-03 03:40:17 not to mention the unfunded tax break that was supposed to pay for itself by corporations creating jobs ( they bought back their own stocks instead ) and trickle down ( it didn't ) added injury to insult by adding almost two trillion to the federal deficit our kids will pay for
2071 2018-12-03 03:40:11 You're literally arguing on a post about a ban on bump stocks, or making them "illegal". It will have ZERO impact.

2142 2018-12-03 02:52:40 Is it statistically possible to have huge winners but only small losers in volatile penny stocks, with 40k share trades? Seems highly improbable.
2143 2018-12-03 02:51:50 What a total loser who made the initial steps toward a big and very good phone call with President of the Obama Administration legalized bump stocks.

2154 2018-12-03 02:45:03 How management communicates mistakes is very important. No one is mistake-free - as investors 40% of the stocks we buy underperform the market - and I'd be concerned about any company where shareholder communication doesn't include a candid assessment of mistakes. - Bill Nygren

2170 2018-12-03 02:29:45 sometimes a bracelet & bag is too straight forward. I like thoughtful moves: stocks, seed money, bucket list experiences, vintage treasures etc.

2172 2018-12-03 02:27:46 OMG you can’t trade stocks on Wednesday.  Such interference.  You should be for this.  Less $ for exchanges and other middle men.  On wait, don’t you own a 3rd party middle man fee charging crypto company?
2173 2018-12-03 02:26:02 are stocks an option?
2174 2018-12-03 02:24:39 Many penny stocks are referred to as ‘hard to borrow’.  Only a few brokers have shares to short these - TradeZero and CenterPoint are two of the best.  

Shorting is much harder than going long. Practice doing it first, otherwise you can blow your account.

Good luck!
2175 2018-12-03 02:24:39 Yes there you go. So get this they sold stocks to buy corporate bonds? Which is a bigger bubble than in 2008. So their $90 billion hedge fund could lose anywhere from 50-70% over the next decade or sooner. Just like our pension plans here in USA.

2181 2018-12-03 02:20:29 The Cdn dollar doesn't track the movement of IT stocks but of oil price. Commodities that are mined in this country still represent the backbone of the economy. Hardworking ppl are sick n tired of this kind of politicians and liberals.

2210 2018-12-03 01:53:18 Nope, I’m very long stocks, and I think long-term an aggressive approach to China is very bullish for US companies. Unless we protect our hard-earned intellectual property, what value do US companies have?
2211 2018-12-03 01:52:54 Also, good thing it takes about 3 weeks for these to get to NJ via ePacket. Could stand to lose 5-8 lbs. to fit into one of these. Thankfully the Thai soccer jersey knockoff market recognizes the popularity of the sport among fat Americans and stocks XXL's accordingly.
2212 2018-12-03 01:52:34 Lower valuation were also the reason and devalue of currency was also the reason. Now they will earn double with appriciating currency and appriciating stocks
2213 2018-12-03 01:52:08 When it comes to stocks, it works like so- First comes the news, then comes a rise or fall in stock price.  The first person to get the news and takes action does far better than the last. So evaluate your news source frequently.

2266 2018-12-03 01:01:21 Also I need advice about buying weed stocks
2267 2018-12-03 01:00:24 If we were judging companies simply off profit coming in now, ppl wouldn’t be invested in many of the tech stocks they’re in. Look at more than profits. Their margins are down this quarter and they’re losing more market share than they’re gaining. I think its a little expensive.
2268 2018-12-03 00:59:47 I was wondering why we seem so broke and then realized it’s because B has $10K in stocks, we’ve spent over $2k on the dog in the past few months, we still haven’t gotten our security deposit back (we moved in aug) and previous roommates owe us money

2275 2018-12-03 00:47:26 Stocks: Huge gap higher for SP500 futures tonight on US/China. Seems obvious someone will sell to fill it someday, but when. 30 minutes from now or 3 weeks. The idea of bullish objectives if trade >2750 looks smart now. Objectives >2800 created Thur/Fri.

2278 2018-12-03 00:42:27 @RobinhoodApp Do you offer short selling stocks feature now?

2280 2018-12-03 00:41:29 Stocks appear headed massively higher tomorrow on the news of the trade war ceasefire.

Curiously bonds not buying it and yield curve remains at 20 bps.

Am more inclined to believe the bond market myself.
2281 2018-12-03 00:41:04 Stocks are taking shape for a rally into years end. We should see a great move higher.

2285 2018-12-03 00:37:37 You have to think of your health as an investment

2287 2018-12-03 00:36:52 I rely on anti-rejection pills after a liver transplant. My chemist told me last month he was having difficulty getting stocks. Wrote about it on Twitter and Leavers thought I was joking. Brexit is real.

2290 2018-12-03 00:32:10 CLARIFICATION: Guns per se aren't the problem, but some specific guns have been put on the market due to gun toting gonzo stupid. Those #guns & gun accessories include bump stocks, AR15 type, large magazines, etc. No other nation is as gonzo stupid. Let's not be different & dead.
2291 2018-12-03 00:32:02 There's something about the @ColinJost #Izod ads that makes me want to use corporate tax cut savings to buy back stocks instead of giving out holiday bonuses.

2298 2018-12-03 00:22:48 Diabetes stocks are badass
2299 2018-12-03 00:22:38 You can't predict future returns at all, so the allocation to stocks shouldn't be "sold" this way. Historically riskier assets have better returns and it is important to have some in a portfolio to help protect against inflation. However, don't risk what you can't afford to lose.

2305 2018-12-03 00:17:50 Part of the problem is that they always sell stocks on the concept of total returns over 40 years. Nice, happy numbers. They ought to be showing 5, 10, and 15 years returns. They will still be good but probably not that pretty.
2306 2018-12-03 00:16:43 S&P will drop to $500 - We all know its the fed and the companies buying their own stocks on credit, right!? When it happens...you better be prepared... no gov or fed will be able to fix this one

2308 2018-12-03 00:14:58 We ain't playing out here. I'm taking names and stocks.

2314 2018-12-03 00:08:10 Have I checked my paystub? Is that what you're asking? 
Yes I have. Nothing changed from Trump and recently my retirement, stocks, and Bitcoins are all down.

2316 2018-12-03 00:06:12 there have been stocks to buy and stocks to sell. isn't that the kind of market we all prefer anyway? better than a one sided market right? what do you guys think?
2317 2018-12-03 00:05:24 #btc is an illusion built on empty hopes. Stocks represent a stake in the productive value creation of the human industry. It is a utter nonsense to try to compare the two. Come back when you realize you are holding a bag of vacuum
2318 2018-12-03 00:02:51 I'm wondering if I should buy stocks now since they have pretty much plummeted.
2319 2018-12-03 00:02:14 I agree... if it goes over 2800 too much, say 2840 where my stop loss is at, I will flip to go long on stocks on your GGSM list.
2320 2018-12-03 00:01:24 Chavez and Maduro did nothing wrong, Venezuela was paradise before Obama’s sanctions. Venezuela only sold stocks and bonds to Americans, nobody else. They had all the food and medicine they needed before America didn’t touch it
2321 2018-12-03 00:01:14 How are stocks down 30%?  Is that even a serious assertion?
2322 2018-12-03 00:00:43 Where all the bears now ????  I thought the bull market is over and I'm the dummy ???
