13 2018-02-15 22:24:38 I think it sounds like a great idea. I have witnessed many who get food stamps selling them, & this would provide nutritious food, so the kids could eat even if mom & dad wanted to get booze or drugs. They used to use commodities, but here they would include meat. Win win.

15 2018-02-15 22:20:02 Not a good program but it was all they had.  Food items were high quality and often sold to those not drawing commodities.  Joke was you had to own a new Cadillac or Buick to qualify for the program.

52 2018-02-15 20:48:34 can't any policy be in place to control this? 
specially with manufactures of such commodities
53 2018-02-15 20:48:15 We had a food program in the 50s for low income people.  They drew a "Box" of items referred to as commodities.  Flour, cheese, dried beans, etc.  They picked up their commodities each month, usually at the county court house.
54 2018-02-15 20:47:22 Yeah it's not so much based in reality as some weird-ass obsession these people have with girls' bodies as commodities!
55 2018-02-15 20:44:26 It could be your hometown next, or the town 30 minutes away. This isn't going to stop until we stop giving out weapons like they're everyday commodities
56 2018-02-15 20:31:32 I'll try to throw some fundamental info in tomorrow's article and list which things I follow for oil information. Also, the inflation issue and weak dollar is affecting all commodities, watch gold and GDX, it moves with oil and XOP fairly closely.

62 2018-02-15 20:11:47 It is more like a community forum where they bring local personalities to talk. It is definitely a high-budget venture with all the "commodities" they have there.

65 2018-02-15 19:57:21 @georgesoros why do people think you have anything to do with anarchism and socialism?
You made your money off of artificially inflating and deflating the cost of trading commodities you are a parasite just like Donald Trump and every other rich person.
66 2018-02-15 19:54:45 Here is the only way to prevent this from happening.  Tyrannical rulership. That is it. Have armed soldiers everywhere to suppress freedom of thiught and press. Eliminate private ownership of anything and restrict all commodities.

68 2018-02-15 19:51:40 Innovative? Back when I was a kid, the program was called "Commodities". Dry skim milk, government cheese - any of this ringing a bell?
69 2018-02-15 19:36:19 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.
70 2018-02-15 19:33:27 In addition to previous observation, it is logical to derive the followings : under conditions of a weakening USD, when forex (e.g. USD/EUR, USD/GBP, USD/CHF) and commodities (eg oils、gold) are not showing quantum entanglement, three things could happen : (1) When volatilities

73 2018-02-15 19:27:28 During the Homefront the public reduced the consumption of scarce commodities, including fuel, to produce more food, and not to hoard essential items. In most cases, it avoided trying to set prices or regulate commercial activity. #jmsshpa10 @CanMusHistory

How the hell can you disregard gender when it comes to raising a child? A mothers instincts cannot, and should not be replaced with commodities that can be bought and sold as products.
Correct, its a human life being traded for self indulgence
78 2018-02-15 19:11:17 Shareholders monetize your very life through underwriting or other means. Are we commodities to our representatives? We’re traded among patrons who coordinate down-selection of representative choices we have to vote for and the narrative portrayal.

101 2018-02-15 17:23:25 Even if they can't work and don't pay taxes their family does. treat people like family and not commodities or irrelevant blobs of protoplasm
102 2018-02-15 17:23:07 In the 1980s the poor could collect commodities. Flour, sugar, cornmeal, cheese. President Reagan. Additionally lowered the speed limit and told Americans to lower the thermostat
103 2018-02-15 17:22:27 MONEY’s a medium of exchange for efficiently trading commodities when intermediaries/nonimmediacy involved: a device CREATED in shift from hunting/gathering (no ex med needed) to ag/industry (10-5K yrs ago).

NOT REMOTELY SAME.

114 2018-02-15 16:46:08 This will be the fate of essential but commercialised commodities such as food, water, pure natural air, light etc.!
115 2018-02-15 16:39:19 Hence there is immanent in capital an inclination and constant tendency, to heighten the productiveness of labour, in order to cheapen commodities, and by such cheapening to cheapen the labourer himself.
116 2018-02-15 16:37:44 This is on you Mr. Speaker - you are an #NRA puppet and have done nothing to protect our most precious commodities - children and educators. Do the nation a huge favor and #Resign
117 2018-02-15 16:37:42 this country really needs to stop selling itself short and get value for our commodities because the dreams i have, at least for the future infrastructure, requires the funds to improve our quality of life.

My mother gets a box of commodities monthly, she gets this + a block of cheese. The pasta & peanut butter are usually expired.

129 2018-02-15 15:59:18 I really just have been trying to chill since the election of this psychopath, and not let it get to me. But...after reading that they basically want to go back to food commodities, punishing the poor, & 2 school shootings within 24 hours...I think, I'm officially in my feelings.
130 2018-02-15 15:59:13 That. Whole. Narrative. Is. Bullshit.
The Commodities Program destroyed the health of whole tribes of Native Americans.
Tribes moved from Commodities to Food Stamps in the mid to late 1970s.

131 2018-02-15 15:58:47 @SHAQ “jokingly” telling LeBron to go to Golden State is lending to my take that the players are secretly conversing about seizing even more control of the league.
Because to the players being commodities that can be “shipped”(excuse me @JalenRose) at a moments notice is not cool
132 2018-02-15 15:58:30 Agree.
When we had commodities people would walk outside and throw away the flour, powdered milk and corn meal. Sell the five lb block of cheese for a buck.
They had no idea what to do with basic ingredients.

The EU imposes tariffs on pretty much anything that isn't a base raw material, meaning that all the value has to be added in the EU. Take coffee as an example. Do you know how much
211 2018-02-15 10:54:07 This is so unbelievably ignorant. The EU imposes tariffs on many goods imported from outside the EU, designed to keep rich EU countries rich while keeping poor countries like Africa poor. Without those tariffs we can buy identical commodities elsewhere much more economically.

238 2018-02-15 07:52:54 Bring back commodities that will fatten up the work load again. Canned whole chicken and canned meat, dried powdered eggs and milk
239 2018-02-15 07:52:01 AND THE SHAME.  
I remember Govt Commodities food from late 1950s, early 60s.
Horrible canned mystery meat. Powdered eggs, milk.
I'll never forget the shame, 
I recall that most of all.
240 2018-02-15 07:51:33 3-
"That means that Haiti has to import rice and other agricultural commodities from the US from US agribusiness, which is getting a huge part of its profits from state subsidies. So you get highly subsidized US agribusiness pouring commodities into Haiti;"
241 2018-02-15 07:48:43 It is proven that food stamp dollars are poured right  back into the economy-unlike dirty money handed out in the form of wealthy people's tax breaks.
Govt Commodities food-
I remember them. Canned mystery meat. Cans of dry peanut butter and powdered eggs/milk.
And shame.
242 2018-02-15 07:43:42 The key to development is local value addition i.e. local processing, these jokers should know that. Stop the selling of unprocessed commodities and see how many billions would stay in Africa.

247 2018-02-15 07:20:37 Either that or debt jubilee. The latter is probably politically untenable.

Regardless, either way “real” assets like commodities are at historic lows vs financial assets. 

I know where I’d rather be right now.
248 2018-02-15 07:18:29 I really have no idea but I know China is a major exporter of both commodities and human resources!
What do we export besides oil?
My question is that, why do Nigerian governments push the foreign reserve propaganda so much?
Why is it more important to say quality healthcare?

250 2018-02-15 07:03:37 According to the report that I read they said non-perishable which means no meat/meat by-product, or anything perishable within 14 days. In the mid-70s I remember my grandparents getting the commodities, it didn't help.
251 2018-02-15 06:57:58 COMMODITIES were on the rise Yesterday in the Afternoon, CRUDE OIL moved 3 USD higher to 61.30 and GOLD added 250 PIPS to reach 1,350 USD.
252 2018-02-15 06:44:44 What I also don’t get is that those are more proven commodities than what you have after Noah/deGrom. Yes you have a deep rotation on paper, but we’ve seen that expecting them to sustain that success over long periods won’t go down
253 2018-02-15 06:43:14 Dictionaries and literacy appear to be highly overrated commodities these days. SMH
254 2018-02-15 06:31:32 Prices of basic commodities will hike so as to accommodate the bloated executive
255 2018-02-15 06:05:46 We already have sensible gun laws. What's required is protection in schools for our children. Our kids are sitting ducks, easy targets. We protect everything else in America with weapons. Why not our most precious commodities. TSA,local&state cops, boarder security, now our kids.
256 2018-02-15 06:03:01 Having a secret police, using torture, selling commodities for a price, using slave labour. 

Don't want to be a dick... but yeah. xD
257 2018-02-15 06:00:56 Socialists need to grapple with the dynamic complexities of the vast socio-economic relationships within free markets, these serving as the most efficient means for allocation of resources and commodities and ensuring general stability within the framework of the civil society.
258 2018-02-15 05:33:17 I don't think people realize that commodities were always in big quantities. Big loaves of lunchmeat, real butter and cheese. Flour and sugar was in huge sacks. More than most people could eat. EBT would be to fill in with produce and meat
259 2018-02-15 05:30:41 You're thinking "safety".  A "Security Token" in our context is a tokenized representation of a real world asset like stocks, bonds, real estate, or commodities.
Some examples from these issuers: @22xFund, @blockchaincap, @tokenfunder, @SPiCE_VC, @Property_Coin, @vaultbankICO
260 2018-02-15 05:23:49 Also- women aren’t commodities that lose value as you use them. They are people
261 2018-02-15 05:23:38 and he want to cutfood stamps,  send commodities, raise gas and diesel tax 25 cents a gallon.  He understands family pain. BS
262 2018-02-15 05:22:18 In the game cashflow, you buy stocks low, and sell them high, commodities are set to rally as stocks fall like a Bitcoin off 2000.
263 2018-02-15 05:16:15 My husband and I had to use what was then called commodities. Big big boxes of good food. Hams block cheese dried beans and peas. Lots more

267 2018-02-15 04:52:13 Trump is reminding me of a spend and tax predecessor hmmm. And to raise the gas tax is pure stupid. Its all smoke and mirrors all we are just commodities
268 2018-02-15 04:30:06 Old school food "commodities" that were given out were pretty good. My Grandma used to get them. Rice, beans, cheese, butter ... I would like to see less fraud. (1)
269 2018-02-15 04:27:53 Commodities day today...Big rally globally. 

Metals in green in India and Australia.
270 2018-02-15 04:19:03 Sure, #crypto won't last forever. What does anyway? Your shitty job gets automated away; houses fall apart; good suburbs turn bad when businesses outsource; stocks crash; demand for commodities dies or becomes oversupplied; and fiat gets inflated away.
271 2018-02-15 04:12:31 Shouldnt it be the other way round? If Fed hikes, bond may not like it and stocks might like it and commodities outperform at the very late cycle

273 2018-02-15 04:03:30 Before food stamps there were commodities.  There still are some places that do this for qualified. Usually its the necessary foods like dairy prod., meat, bread, canned fruit and veggies. There is nothing wrong with it.
274 2018-02-15 03:58:23 OK The Rand has gained and prices of basic commodities still remains the same. How is that benefiting an ordinary South African right now 
275 2018-02-15 03:51:15 The evolution of food assistance from commodities to food stamps was at the insistence of grocery stores who felt the commodities were cutting into their profits. 1/
276 2018-02-15 03:32:21 Having said all of that, if #Giants like Josh Rosen or Sam Darnold, I wouldn't trade dick. I would stay put and draft one of those QB's at No. 2. Some commodities are priceless. A young quality QB are definitely among those said commodities. #GiantsPride

289 2018-02-15 02:32:19 Market seems a little lacklustre despite the US markets doing okay and commodities doing well! I think we need a few big runners to kick things off again. Surely must be lots of spare cash out there!
290 2018-02-15 02:27:54 Yah, they tried that . It was called Commodities. Surplus government cheese, etc. It failed, mainly because of storage and transportation costs.
291 2018-02-15 02:27:39 Gold $GC_F not a bad start... & that weaker U.S. Dollar certainly helped #Commodities led by the #Metals today!
292 2018-02-15 02:26:19 I don’t see anything wrong with it, commodities are still handed out, churches food banks etc. I’ve seen people buy a fountain soda with ebt & pay for cigs with cash!
293 2018-02-15 02:22:54 » nonetheless sets the glass down without further commodities.

294 2018-02-15 02:16:50 I don't know about the rest of you, but I like President Trump's decision to do away with Welfare Checks and go back to issuing commodities.  That does away with mis-use of the funding and affords food to many.
295 2018-02-15 02:12:45 Thanks for the share. And I’m trying learn more but doesn’t this method centralise the commodities more?
296 2018-02-15 02:11:03 Today was an epic day for the #Inflation trade... Zero time to tweet earliar. The reversal post CPI was one of the best sessions we will see in a while for short U.S. Dollar trades and long #Stocks #Commodities & #FX.
297 2018-02-15 02:09:16 Quality. This quality becomes so visible that the present society would mainly be institutions, commodities, social roles rather than pity.
298 2018-02-15 02:04:25 The only issue I see is. when the overall market crashes, so will these.  Baby out with the bathwater.  I'd sit with dry powder until the carnage is well underway. #Commodities
299 2018-02-15 02:02:19 Creo q la única manera de salir es aumentando la producción de bienes y no achicando. Si no hay inversión productiva no hay crecimiento. Si no hay crecimiento hay déficit. Hasta Néstor creció con aumento de precios de commodities. Yo creo q el desafío es crecer pero al 6% anual
300 2018-02-15 01:50:52 I have no family. No friends. No money. No commodities. My mom destroyed my identity. I have little to no resources. My life is in shambles.

There is only one person who truly cares for me. Only one that I can trust. I can't even trust myself. How sad.

303 2018-02-15 01:38:29 You got it right here.
We are not people, we are commodities. We are dollar signs.
Anything to make a buck.
It is gross.
304 2018-02-15 01:38:24 Companies and the state are interdependent. The former needs the latter to protect it, while the latter needs the former for the production of commodities.

Both don't produce any value and extract the value produced from workers. They're parasites.
305 2018-02-15 01:31:07 January Core CPI in line with our forecast but surprised consensus to the upside. As expected this prompted a good reaction by equity markets particularly financials. Core PCE index should rise as core goods prices were strong. Watching soft commodities carefully if move up...
306 2018-02-15 01:27:30 Only in power point presentations, earnings grow linear. In real life, as commodities to currencies fluctuate, earnings are usually lumpy.
307 2018-02-15 01:25:03 No chance. Just being a fan. You trade the unknown commodities for the known bonafide star all day, everyday. I bet you Magic agrees with me privately
308 2018-02-15 01:24:35 So did my tribe ,and ive been on commodities and was blessed with an overabundance! Especially when they added buffalo and ground beef and chicken. We NEVER WENT HUNGRY!
309 2018-02-15 01:21:21 Absolutely. And it still sucks for those who have become unwanted commodities
310 2018-02-15 01:16:47 But if all his brother capitalists were to do the same, where would he find his commodities in the market?
311 2018-02-15 01:16:10 In future he will buy the commodities in the market, instead of manufacturing them himself.
312 2018-02-15 01:15:35 The government literally wants to give out commodities to the nation.
313 2018-02-15 01:06:04 Definitely. This hurts grocers, farmers, shippers. Anyone counting on the purchasing of commodities before they spoil. Everyone talks about the poor buying steaks, you forget that that means the cattleman sold a steak.

316 2018-02-15 00:45:25 What really pisses me off about this lame idea is that these very commodities that trump has the nerve to refer to as a blue apron box are free to the poorest among us. Now they want poor people to pay for this shit that is barely edible. 
317 2018-02-15 00:42:28 “Commodities” 
318 2018-02-15 00:40:22 I would imagine the first asset class was real estate, followed by commodities  (corn, metals, oil etc), then equities  (stocks etc) and bonds. 
You can divide these down further but in general a new asset class is extremely rare and crypto & BTC is just that.
319 2018-02-15 00:33:57 History shows that oz rates don't stay lower than USA for long. Once commodities pick up further I expect our rates to take off. A stronger economy & commods will set off higher rates fairly quickly starting 2018. Like other booms, the boom + rates will be property's downfall

321 2018-02-15 00:15:47 Crypto assets, crypto commodities, crypto securities. There will not be a currency. This illogical anarchist ideology has a hard time seeing this. If you get paid in Bitcoin, I hope taxes are withdrawn first or you report them yourself.

323 2018-02-15 00:07:27 No, but they can sell their boxes or swap them for drugs. There is always a way. This reminds me of the old fashion commodities of cheese, powdered milk, canned fruit, veggies they use to give out where people went down, stood in line to get.
324 2018-02-15 00:03:11 Todo somos conscientes de que además de la vulnerabilidad financiera de nuestra economía frente a la suba de tasas en EUA, también está la caída de los precios de los commodities y la baja en la producción x la sequía?? Esto con déficit comercial récord...
