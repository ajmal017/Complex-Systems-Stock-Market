41 2018-07-04 21:46:29 Why would they? You destabilise the world trading markets and the price of commodities always always goes up. Any economist can tell you this. It’s why in times of crisis people speculate on gold. Would be a good time to invest in alternative fuels eh.
42 2018-07-04 21:43:12 Funny enough everyone, agents in particular, seem to think they can dictate to our beloved MSFC how to price their precious commodities. MSFC transfer is not regulated by anyone but downs. Sundowns is not eskom or a petroleum company
43 2018-07-04 21:41:15 I often hear the term 3-and-D tossed around like this is the kind of player you just go get. 

What you are saying is something who can shoot and play defense, but is not a max contract type because they lack some other skills. These are hot commodities.
44 2018-07-04 21:33:07 As a former analyst I have to wonder how many shorts and spreads and various forms of profiteering on stocks and commodities the Trump family has enjoyed over the last year. Think of Hillary Clinton's commodities hot streak on steroids
45 2018-07-04 21:28:35 They're a commodity. Commodities are only worth what people wasn't to pay for them.  If every star quit tomorrow there would be a practice squad guy or an unsigned guy willing to play for a fraction of the salary.
46 2018-07-04 21:20:52 Where do you get off telling sovereign nations what to price their commodities at? I don't like paying more a the pumps anymore than the next guy but it's a matter of supply and demand. If the price continues to go up we will start drilling again in Canada and you can buy from us
47 2018-07-04 20:57:21 I can tell you flunked basic econ 101.  seriously learn about fungible commodities between tweeting something that a freshman in college KNOWS better than you
48 2018-07-04 20:50:43 That goes for justice, and compassion, and fairness. If you believe that these are finite commodities, then giving to one person can only happen because you took it from someone else. 
This makes me inexpressibly sad.

52 2018-07-04 20:06:07 Feeling safer? Seriously? I still hear news everyday about drugs, rape, robbery and so on. How about bad economy? High inflation rate? Its actually not people who are rising, its basic commodities like fares, oil and so on.

60 2018-07-04 19:22:58 The most important is research and development in agriculture, better storage and marketing for the commodities. BTW farm machinery is already duty free, drip irrigation is subsidised 60-40 and in certain areas government is providing free plants of olive.

72 2018-07-04 18:15:18 A primeira quebra de argumento é que não são eles os responsáveis diretos pela produção agrícola e sim, o produtor (pequeno, médio e grande). E, hoje, a maior parte da produção brasileira segue o modelo de exportação e commodities ( justamente eles sabem melhor do que nós).

112 2018-07-04 14:47:08 If its so good & the claims are true why do they need investors? Why cany their "algorithms" do it for them.
And why only bitcoin? Surely the algorithm would work the same with Forex/commodities et al?
Without Dragons Den the boys would now be wealthy & still own 100%!
113 2018-07-04 14:42:55 Nenhum outro presidente vai poder surfar na onda das commodities, Petrobras,BNDES e obras da copa p financiar a corrupção e implantar as mudanças q o país precisa (tributar apenas renda, herança...).O PT era p ter feito, Logo, Seguiremos eternamente nesse país desigual e em crise
114 2018-07-04 14:40:19 AI and ML are commodities. Data and subjects matter experts are the most important elements in that food chain. See why PhDs are key.
115 2018-07-04 14:38:33 #ModiDupesFarmers There has been more than 50% increase on MSP of all commodities. No one has done such a brilliant job for farmers. Check the data of INC. middle class let us be prepared for 2019 gamble if cost burden is more on your pocket.
116 2018-07-04 14:33:47 #ModiDupesFarmers we demeans that MSP of all commodities should be minimum Rs 1000 per kg. Poors will be happy and rich will be more happy and politics will be effective. Middle class to beg  always, they are APL, no subsidy to them.
117 2018-07-04 14:31:54 Good point. However, I think you left out "stupidity" one of the most common commodities found on Twitter.
118 2018-07-04 14:17:06 It seems they are keeping their options open as am I. I do not have enough knowledge or foresight to say lithium in not the next big thing so I have some exposure to it as I do other commodities.
119 2018-07-04 14:16:47 Good news, however it’s the money men at the top of the smuggling tree that need taking down . No demand no supply like all commodities
120 2018-07-04 14:16:07 “Capitalism is a system that seeks to transgress all boundaries in  its production and sale of commodities, commodifying everything in  existence, which today, in the age of monopoly-finance capital and  surveillance capitalism, means intruding into every aspect of  existence,”
121 2018-07-04 14:13:54 Surely if the Chinese were really that interested they would just buy the actual mining licences rather than investing in AIM minnows? As they have done with other commodities in Africa
122 2018-07-04 14:12:37 i feel a lot of those insults come from people trying to apply consumer value metrics to experimental works and deciding they aren't valuable as commodities. it's a slur which makes sense in the context of there being a "correct" way to make a game which offers value to consumers
123 2018-07-04 14:12:13 I think that should be Zabs or ministry of commerce that regulates quality of such commodities.
124 2018-07-04 14:09:32 Besaram BJP. If I watch this type fake publicity my skull burnt. Oh netaon  in last 10 yrs price of gold , salary of govt employee, company made every day commodities increased etc increased by 5 times. But agri product 2 times why?

126 2018-07-04 14:00:01 Commodities: Steel -3.75%, Canola -2.49%
127 2018-07-04 13:58:09 Each province has their one tax  rate (do you understand what is one tax rate). How it is equal to slab system which apply different tax to different commodities. Ha ha ha   Appears you all  graduated in entire political sciences like your boss
128 2018-07-04 13:54:57 Always good to read past the headline. The point:, instead of saving during the commodities boom & using political clout to reform (previdência, taxes, politics), Lula then Dilma kept spending. The boom ended, recession hit, & social gains of Lula/Dilma are now being erased.
129 2018-07-04 13:53:13 The problem with news is that, for many broadcasters/publishers, in any medium, it has become a commodity. As with all commodities, its value is entirely that which is bestowed upon it as measured by audience viewing figures, whether it be TV, radio, print or on-line.
130 2018-07-04 13:48:46 The person you heard complaining was the one with a fake tv. That's how they pretend to sell legit commodities so you cannot go to the next seller.
131 2018-07-04 13:48:42 I didn’t say we can’t do a deal now but I’m saying a better deal with non EU countries can be done. For example, less tariffs on clothing and commodities from China which directly benefits the working class. Less tariffs on Japanese cars? Lower tariffs on US motor/planes?
132 2018-07-04 13:45:06 I understood like this.
"Lopez Obrador Should Learn From Lula’s Mistakes 
Overspending to stay popular set the stage for Brazil’s recession."
"Instead of leveraging his ... to enact ... reforms, he and his spendthrift successor ... binged their way through the commodities boom,"
133 2018-07-04 13:45:05 The cyclical index looks a bit like an inverted commodity like Gold. The high at the end of 2017 corresponds to the low of the commodities in march 2016. This connection does indeed make a bit of sense. But prophetic?
134 2018-07-04 13:32:20 En un contexto internacional complicado:  suba de tasas, baja de precios de los commodities, guerra comercial EE.UU./China, peligro de perder el "investment grade" por nuestro nivel de déficit y endeudamiento, cualquier vientito nos tumba, lo de está gente ya es demencial.
135 2018-07-04 13:13:26 When has any government procured commodities other than rice, wheat, corn, copra, cotton and groundnut? Procurement of the last five have been rare as also a couple of pulses like arhar. MSP is not statutory or mandatory. It is a signal for the Govt to intervene if it wants.
136 2018-07-04 13:10:03 Los commodities tienen en la actualidad un comportamiento contrario al mercado común regulado por la oferta y la demanda, y este fenómeno, deberá de ser materia de análisis en la academia económica
137 2018-07-04 13:03:56 I'm still appalled by the MacDonalds thing shutting down of Leamington tomatoes with Heinz hiring a former BK CEO. 
But maybe a ploy for something else. Our countries actually need each other for commodities.
138 2018-07-04 13:00:54 I'm an energy commodities trader and yes, within the industry it was a badge of honor to wear Enron swag back then. Enron was what many other companies envied. Skilling was the Musk of commodities.  Beware thinking one person is that much of a genius.

146 2018-07-04 12:28:20 The country having separated itself from GB had nothing to do with slavery.  British merchants were pretty much the biggest players in the slave trade, they were the ones profiting off of selling slaves into the US. In return they would bring commodities back to Britain and
147 2018-07-04 12:26:11 A curto/médio prazo, certo? Porque mesmo a exportação de commodities depende de insumos de preço internacional. Ou não?

Los periodistas del agro dicen la verdad.
149 2018-07-04 12:19:13 Poverty creates stiff competition for scarce commodities. It creates a hunger that 'abundance' may not be able to satisfy. Hence, new lines are drawn, new tents pitched, call it religion, tribalism e.t.c but the real mvp is Broda Poverty 
150 2018-07-04 12:18:32 Of course you can, you burn it, just like any other fuel. The energy used to dig up commodities is not stored in those commodities somehow. It's lost once the job is done. Otherwise it would be worthwhile to use as much energy as possible to dig up stuff.
151 2018-07-04 12:15:55 Minimum support price for many agro commodities increased substantially. Farmers will get more money for their crops. It will cause inflation to rise. Because this is to benefit poor farmers, a moderate inflation is good. #DaagAchcheHain
152 2018-07-04 12:12:37 US dollar has fallen against South Sudanese pounds by 17.5% following signing of permanent ceasefire by President Kiir & rebel leader Riek Machar in Khartoum last month.

155 2018-07-04 12:03:51 It is a good news that the central govt has come to the aid of farmers in fixing MSP for about 14-15 commodities atleast now.About 60-70 thousand crores of loan waiver to farmers  was in UPA rule
156 2018-07-04 11:57:01 @narendramodi great work Modi government always work for corporates now they are increasing prices of various agricultural commodities when it is being sold to mediators...this is your governance model benefit to mediators and zero to kisan...

That’s our ag sector saviour.

Where’s the plan to survive for ag in NZ?

160 2018-07-04 11:48:36 Bitcoin doesn't absorb energy, the computers that run the network do. It's also not a commodity. Commodities are physical, tangible things. Bitcoin is just an arbitrary accounting unit.
161 2018-07-04 11:41:42 When I saw C's initial tweets I thought of the white women who came out of the g*merg*te mess and made a name for themselves. I thought of the pussy hats, and t-shirts co-opting black women slang/sayings and resold to wider white audiences. Like, literal commodities.

167 2018-07-04 11:21:05 Siraj Hussain: Expect MSP For a Few Commodities To Be Higher Than International Prices
168 2018-07-04 11:06:27 MSP looks attractive but it is much below the actual price in market for many commodities and still below cost of production but this step will be effective only if proper arrangements are made be FCI a nd govt agencies for prompt and assured purchase.

177 2018-07-04 09:52:57 Ethirajan, this will also increase the retail price of food commodities consumer pays. Retail inflation will raise a bit but hope it is transitional. As long as farmers get the benefit in hand, welcome.
178 2018-07-04 09:51:29 First, revenue/=DJIA value... There's a correlation, not a direct relationship.

Secondly, it's easy to replace commodity goods. iPhones and Boeing aren't commodities.

188 2018-07-04 09:24:17 and as the climate apocalypse takes hold, organization of productive forces around the satisfaction of needs rather than the exchange-values of commodities will be a pretty rational way to keep existing

192 2018-07-04 08:50:37 @fromaloktandon ji I would also want you to revisit you tariffs on the price of food commodities and beverages. Extremely exorbitantly priced!
193 2018-07-04 08:43:48 seems like monetary conditions are too tight need China need to bring down short term rates to stablise risk assets, strengthen capital controls, result weaker CNH and weaker demand for commodities, NZD and AUD continue to get whacked.
194 2018-07-04 08:43:28 On the lines of Govt declaring MSP's for commodities, do we need to ask Govt to initiate an MSP for stocks also, especially s&m caps. After buying at a certain price, if the stock price goes below our purch. price, the govt pays us 106% from the funds collected through LTCG/STT.
195 2018-07-04 08:35:51 Puro ka "kill". Solve the issue of inflation first. Baka mas madami na mamatay kasi hindi man lang makabili ng basic commodities. Ang dami mong kuda tungkol sa hindi immediate na problema. Ni hindi mo maprotektahan pangisdaan. Binigay mo na sa China.
196 2018-07-04 08:21:59 Btw you guys, did you know the fuel tax is higher, and some other VERY relevant commodities !

The #SocialMediaTax makes the public forget. Honest opinion.
197 2018-07-04 08:13:37 yea. usually communism/socialism is defined by 

1. no wage-labor
2. no private ownership of capital
3. production of commodities for use-value not exchange-value

under democratically org'd workplaces/economy which is implied by points 1 and 2.. and 3

199 2018-07-04 08:11:02 and the profit motive is how we organize production. we produce commodities for exchange-value on the market, not for use-value to humanity. its more profitable to let bruised fruit rot in the fields than ship it to homeless ppl with no money

225 2018-07-04 06:59:31 My request to @narendramodi Sir, increase in MSP should be implemented rightly & taken to logical extent, so farmers are able to benefit this in real terms

My request to all Modi supporters, increase in MSP might increase price of commodities for temporary period. Extend support
226 2018-07-04 06:51:36 It is a rallying call for us, to ensure consistency in supply of quality #FamilyPlanning commodities ~ @Chebett_Laboso #JazaShelves
227 2018-07-04 06:47:13 lol the means of production are very specifically everything necessary to make commodities OTHER THAN worker labor. He's using a straw man argument to actively misrepresent the conversation the rest of us are trying to have.
228 2018-07-04 06:45:40 The commodities market was forever destroyed and the honest businesses shut down in the wake of Corzine theft and worse response. Corzine never prosecuted. Got off scotfree & worse things Obama did
229 2018-07-04 06:43:53 all so Democrats could keep their union slushfund, & Chrysler was handed over by Obama to a Communist Labor Union owning Fiat.
John Corzine stole $5billion from Global commodities trading and lost it playing futures markets-Regulators froze  all assets, you couldn't sell to cover

238 2018-07-04 05:56:30 Makerere seeks to increase tuition b'se times have changed and the cost of commodities is high.
The same university scrapped off food provision in halls and offered shs 4,000 per day for breakfast, lunch and supper.
I think according to them, students live in medieval times.

240 2018-07-04 05:04:01 I think this team is more than 1-2 pieces away. We have 1 legit scoring line and a handful of hopeful D. Need more proven commodities at every position, some of which may come from kids. FA was not the answer this year. You splash on that when you're truly 1 piece away
241 2018-07-04 05:03:48 Reality Check

What’s considered good returns?

10% Equities

20% Commodities

35% Forex

200% Crypto

Crypto can deliver 200% with swing trading without any crypto ever going to Moon. If you are waiting for Moon, you may end up losing the opportunity to go to stars

244 2018-07-04 04:53:26 Can you go and check tax rates on both these commodities before GST, and then compare from their past rates. As if your lovely Congress was charging NIL tax on sanitary napkins?
245 2018-07-04 04:40:37 i think the fight is abt tax slab and not province wise variation. please check if all commodities in any province are taxed at one rate or not.
246 2018-07-04 04:32:21 Women are not commodities & must be treated as human beings with equal rights 2men, politicians from across d nation must think, make equal laws, u r old enough 2b married, 2hv max children, but not old enough 2hv control of ur own body.

248 2018-07-04 04:07:16 profit vs the intangibles is not a fair fight with modern commodities

It is shameless cowardice & laziness that is ubiquitous in the modern vehicle anesthetic and it rests on the palette like a fresh diaper. Satisfying as sucking on a transistor

technology is no substitute

257 2018-07-04 03:13:10 Even the most overtly political works of art can simultaneously, as commodities, participate in the reproduction of the structural inequities they profess to condemn. The author is a producer.

263 2018-07-04 02:24:37 I would pull almost all of my profits and get into FX and Commodities trading seriously. 100x within 24h sounds too volatile and I wouldn't invest too much money on crypto after that happens. & Of course I will withdraw some of those phat dosh to enjoy myself to the fullest.
264 2018-07-04 02:06:12 Which of these Agri commodities will create the highest gains over the next six months? 

Join this poll and explore your commodity engagement.
265 2018-07-04 01:56:09 Modernisation and industrialisation has made human beings into commodities..
266 2018-07-04 01:43:21 Also wanted to mention, I see some buying commodities, metals, oil, corn, soybeans, etc., etc., that is NOT my game.  I seek the VERY BEST MERCHANDISE when the market is in a confirmed up-trend per IBD & Bill O'Neil's principles! Not interested in buying junk off the bottom! ...
267 2018-07-04 01:42:38 I doubt it. Thanks for sharing that. I explain to pts that PBM deals on medication are like commodities trades. You get all sorts of seemingly chaotic unpredictable results for prior auth that can only be explained by volatility IMO
268 2018-07-04 01:41:09 Also, FWIW, I’m not ideologically opposed to markets. I just thing they’re problematic and don’t have a good track record overseeing public interests. Markets are good for individualism/commodities...neither of which is education (or libraries, roads, military, police, etc)

270 2018-07-04 01:35:19 @Glencore Look around you. You are surrounded by persons who are responsible for your financial ruin. Let’s take the example of Glencore, CEO Ivan Glasenberg. As we suspected in our reports, most of the manipulations came from Katanga Commodities division run by him & Gentler DRC
271 2018-07-04 01:22:49 y en su opinion un tipo de cambio al alza o fuerte como afecta? algunos dicen q ayuda en el corto plazo para compensar la subida de commodities importados. Pero q afecta en el largo plazo pq descinsentiva inversion
272 2018-07-04 01:15:52 I’m genuinely curious.  What percentage of your income do you pay in taxes?  Also, what is your state tax rate on commodities?
273 2018-07-04 00:50:52 We’ve all been there. I got a bad story about DGAZ.  It was like stabbing myself over and over. I no longer play commodities. Nope. Happy 4th. It’ll be ok.
274 2018-07-04 00:43:53 Why work, it’s free!!! I’m old enough to remember Ike as president hard times no welfare Medicade not much commodities but we made it. If a dog gets hungry enough it’ll find food! I still use home remedies, could lay in dr’s office. I was taught work!!!!
275 2018-07-04 00:42:01 Like, we are less reliant on India for essential food/commodities now. The fully funded medial scheme will see less overseas medical travel with the opening of Dharumavantha Hospital. More families are choosing Sri Lanka or Malaysia for their childrens education. The list goes on

278 2018-07-04 00:36:52 I find the accrual and identification of talent fascinating. I trade commodities and options in the early morning and spend a copious amount of time poring through financial charts to identify trends and investment opportunities. I feel the acquisition of talent is similar.
279 2018-07-04 00:35:56 Commodities looking good. Should see some nice gains in July in this space. I will try and post all trades for the next 6 months without all the B.S. Keep it plain and simple.
280 2018-07-04 00:07:27 I don't agree. WoN description doesn't apply now. Rent prices are determined like other commodities in a liquid market. We aren't surfs anymore. Try buying land and renting it out. The price of the land is a function of the market price and cost of capital.
281 2018-07-04 00:02:04 Yeah! I still can't believe how I could FC in a bus Watashitachi wa Mirai no Hana... but I couldn't in the commodities of my house! xD
