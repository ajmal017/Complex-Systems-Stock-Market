Sir, One question.

I've heard rumours about paypal etc getting introduced as a payment method to simplify the payment process Why not the Govt. establish its own systems(maybe crypto) & utilise it as a revenue generator?

10 2018-10-16 23:58:42 A small hedge to the traditional institutional portfolio may be what they’re looking for. I doubt Fidelity get into the asset class if their customers had 0 interest

48 2018-10-16 23:55:51 Yes they are the same. BTC was created with code just like XRP. The method of consensus has nothing to do with the creation process. It's pretty damn simple to be honest, they didn't have a better idea to prevent double spending. PoW is 1.0 tech. Deterministic consensus is 2.0

95 2018-10-16 23:50:31 hehe, maybe you're right amigo. but why do you disagree? If other legit stable coins (gemini and circle) grow to be say 10B and tether remains where it is, why will it not soften the blow should Tether be the center of a 3 letter agency shutdown operation?
96 2018-10-16 23:50:29 And don't confuse blockchain technology and crypto currencies. Crypto uses blockchain technology.
97 2018-10-16 23:50:15 Sooo you would rather pay Billions$$ worldwide to Monopolistic Energy Tycoon Companies, who keep that money in the Fiat world, than pay the money to Ripple who in turn uses that money to enrich and continue to develop the crypto world of XRP? You make perfect sense....

99 2018-10-16 23:50:02 Out here with that Lupe bullshit.
100 2018-10-16 23:49:51 the use case that makes crypto special (and able to function as 'money') is the zero-knowledge proof. Crypto isn't itself a solution for trust, rather it's a good implementation of zero-knowledge proof, which solves 'how can I trust that a stranger has what they say they have'
101 2018-10-16 23:49:39 Pretty awesome!
102 2018-10-16 23:49:16 It would be impossible for every Fidelity brokerage customer to own even one Bitcoin. This is why Bitcoins are worth thousands of dollars, while a dollar is only worth one dollar (and only until next year when when it's worth 97 cents). Save wisely. #crypto #bitcoin

131 2018-10-16 23:44:21 Ripple make most of their money through signing banks and FIs. Of course they want it to grow, they have a vested interest in it's success. If you held majority of BTC wouldn't you want it to grow, wouldn't you promote adoption?
132 2018-10-16 23:44:19 Anyway, the discussion was on if the tokens were created out of thin air or not and if BTC was similar, which by now has been shown to you is not the same. If you don’t understand the difference by now, you never will. Reread my Chris Larsen reply.

They are an illegitimate criminal organisation who rob and coerce people through the threat of force. 
They certainly don’t represent the general population.
Are you really that eager to be extorted?

136 2018-10-16 23:43:25 Using your definition, I agree it can be thought of as a platform. Have millions of people used crypto as a solution for trust in a digital platform though? Not trying to pick an argument - am admittedly out of my league here.
137 2018-10-16 23:43:18 By inference, it seems as though  is reacting vis a vis the Chinese govt’s involvement in crypto. Needless to say  mining or utilizing crypto would be a huge step forward.

152 2018-10-16 23:40:59 Yeah I read it, they were ‘gifted’ the tokens. Who gives a crap, they got all the tokens for free. The fact that you think creating the tokens or the tokens being gifted to them makes any difference shows how brainwashed you are.

the old money games are for the history books.
157 2018-10-16 23:40:40 Right even if binance doesn't do the swap which I doubt they won't do the swap, I'll just swap it how they say to do it. It's not like it would be hard

177 2018-10-16 23:38:07 They didn't create XRP. do some research FFS mate. You just blindly follow all the BTC maxis. It was gifted to Ripple, Ripple was named after the Ripple protocol, XRP was open coin and new coin XNS before being named XRP. Ripple have a vision that I fully believe in.

182 2018-10-16 23:37:19 No I don’t. Something would be horribly wrong with BTC if we could know who owns how much. You mean they don’t want their wealth to crash by dumping tokens on the market? Wow, what a commitment! You are very easily satisfied, aren’t you?

196 2018-10-16 23:35:11 Look he’s tired of hearing crypto idiots tell him they know more than him and he’s blinded to any normal discourse. So he’s now resorted to insulting anyone who smells like a crypto supporter. It’s his prerogative, it’s just a dick move.
197 2018-10-16 23:34:57 I guess there are two types of people in this world. Those who realize unsealable loopholes are meant to be exploited, and those who think taxes are moral.
198 2018-10-16 23:34:49 He’s not incorrect on either count. Yes, Hayden’s tweet has that kind of cult vibe that immediately makes people question the tech. Yes, bots are a massive problem which should be an immediate concern for all of us. As for the rest? I know crypto people, and that’s a bold claim.
199 2018-10-16 23:34:46 We're still talking about distribution here not creation. The initial post was that #XRP was created out of thin air. In the words of David Schwartz "all cryptos are created from thin air, they don't occur in nature".
200 2018-10-16 23:34:42 Yes, a company that created billions of tokens out of thin air and still owns the majority wants the price to go up. You think they are doing that for you? 
201 2018-10-16 23:34:39 Agree. I think crypto is it's own country.  all countries now will compete for citizenship and/or participation.

205 2018-10-16 23:33:40 What does TS3 stand for?
206 2018-10-16 23:33:09 yep. he called it. 5th or 6th time was the charm. people act like he said it a week before the crisis. if i remember correctly wasn't he wrong for years before finally being right? He also missed a near 30,000% move in BTC in the time since one of his crypto doomsday calls
207 2018-10-16 23:33:06 Those scammers that prey on the official threads of @YobitExchange didn't keep me out for long!

242 2018-10-16 23:27:17 First, the fact  is considering crypto is good—but reasons that it would aren’t exactly signals of a good currency:  will always simply seek rails for the dollar.  concerns me less: Bitcoin is the greatest flight of yuan ever, their escape from tyranny and govt. control. 
243 2018-10-16 23:26:42 There are 1.5T USD in circulation for comparison. 15 times XRPs total supply. XRP will be used to transfer billions of $$$ across the globe. 3 FIs have already adopted XRP as a means for cross boarder settlement and we have Coil for web monetization and streaming payments.

253 2018-10-16 23:24:50 Thing is, the longer it takes to implode, the more time the rest of the ecosystem has to grow (new stable coins done correctly) and the less the impact. I'm starting to think that if tether lives another 12 months, the impact may be a lot less then we all expect

256 2018-10-16 23:24:23 With the #crypto narrative soon to be trending more toward privacy - it may be wise to do some research and load up.

@GrayscaleInvest has invested $6.3 million into privacy coin @horizenglobal
- fixed cap of 21,000,000
- Priced significantly cheaper than competitors #XMR #ZEC
257 2018-10-16 23:24:21 Excellent
258 2018-10-16 23:24:03 Not true- Visa and Mastercard have consumer protection, and bank-wiring if you get the wiring acc. wrong the money comes back to you.  This standard is not met by crypto.  Fiat is a low bar / crypto must meet and exceed the standards set by current dominant companies and banks!!
259 2018-10-16 23:23:53 At this point all crypto currency is going to just fade into the ether right?
260 2018-10-16 23:23:43 Yes sir!

274 2018-10-16 23:22:18 It's really sad to witness indeed. The thing is that he is trying to understand the potential revolution that crypto currencies are without a fucking knowledge of the technology. New brilliant economists gonna have to have PhD in IT if they want to be relevant from now on imo.
275 2018-10-16 23:22:18 audiocoinやsingularDTVが競合ですかね。

これらの同行期待していたんですけどね。
ソニーは独自で類似のブロックチェーンプラットフォーム構築しているみたいですし、どうなっていくのだろう？
276 2018-10-16 23:22:07 Mining for BTC isn't a good enouh value proposition. So greater utility plus scarcity = value? Then XRP has a greater value proposition as it is finite and has more use cases. 100B total supply isn't much when you're talking global adoption.
277 2018-10-16 23:22:02 jeah man such wow ;)
278 2018-10-16 23:21:49 Agreed, and I myself have done so also. That being said, I still take little weight from calls from mike.

Not trading, just observing, but pot stocks are legal today in Canada. Have you been observing these crypto like pumps? Any thoughts?
279 2018-10-16 23:20:51 CME is licensed futures exchange. Crypto exchanges are not. They don't meet the definition of 'actual delivery' (spot exchange) if they're offering trading while not being fully reserved on the undelying.
280 2018-10-16 23:20:37 Certified Diamond Coin is a Stable coin. Each coin is backed up with 0.04 cts of diamond. As a security token it fulfils the role of reserve currency and is considered as a derivative. We will create stability in Crypto currency market. #CDiamondCoin @cdiamondcoin

282 2018-10-16 23:20:18 Agree.

Hedging with precious metals, diversified crypto, indexes for long term restabilization, and international currency for short term buoyancy.

285 2018-10-16 23:19:47 The economics in crypto are as clear as day at the moment. The fact an expert in economics has to point it out to people is what is asinine here. If you want to throw away your money betting against him, go ahead. Just don't cry like a bitch when the house of cards collapses.
286 2018-10-16 23:19:41 My mom was the bread winner and so was my grandma. My wife's mom also. Her aunt was a high ranking general. Personally i have not seen this disparity in real life. I believe it happens but it is not all sexism IMO.

329 2018-10-16 23:12:27 In my experience the exchange’s amount of an asset it offers for trading is never a factor. @CMEGroup doesn’t need a reserve of Eurodollar futures because it only matches buyers w sellers. Crypto doesn’t seem to play by these rules, is your point?

392 2018-10-16 23:01:31 Most legit exchanges will also ask you to provide a story as to where the funds came from and may ask trading histories to back this up. if you can present this, great... but I think they may look at this as a case of possible ML if it looks like the source has been hidden

399 2018-10-16 23:00:32 Yeah that was my point. But I think once the training wheels come off, staking will be pretty high, especially for high value contracts.

406 2018-10-16 23:00:01 And your point of using VPNs and "mixing" your coins is a really bad idea. The more proof you have to support the source of funds the better. VPNs and mixing likely will cause you issues with legitimate exchanges (non tether) because country of residence may not match IP usage.
407 2018-10-16 22:59:25 In this chart.. It took almost one year for compet torture. In crypto this works in a matter of one month. So diabet and other stress diseases will come faster :)

I'll give my buddy a call, he just filed for himself and his cop - both with crypto gains and I'm pretty sure there will be some crypto/crypto trades in there. follow up shortly

My friend telll me.
414 2018-10-16 22:58:20 Yeah just wanted to clarify.  I think that's very plausible since nodes might be reluctant to escrow the large amounts required for some contracts off the bat for fear of them being penalized incorrectly.

428 2018-10-16 22:56:16 >> The main difference is that cryptocurrencies and crypto exchanges are not regulated; therefore, that kind of  scam (which is jail matter when done with real stocks) is perfectly legal.
429 2018-10-16 22:56:00 Lol, this shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone. I’m surprised this is even news.

434 2018-10-16 22:55:36 The reason I was saying not full value right of the gate is to make sure the network is working properly. So they substitute initial trust with consortium governance. Does the make sense?

438 2018-10-16 22:55:17 I mean trust in the protocol as in the nodes deliver correct data. So yeah nodes could put up full value to compensate for lack of trust.

442 2018-10-16 22:53:39 and u think they advise their clients to buy cryptos?
443 2018-10-16 22:53:34 duke has better bagmen and they probably use something untraceable like crypto currency
444 2018-10-16 22:53:34 Yeah it is.
445 2018-10-16 22:53:22 They are the worst and imo added to a lot of the downfall in crypto at the very beginning of this year. They are shit
446 2018-10-16 22:52:52 Everyone wishing #xrp to be listed on @Coinbase should really check their priorities. Would you rather be listed somewhere which has no clear vision for this space OR have methodical planning implemented by the #1 crypto mgmt team in Ripple. #patience #0doubtXRP
447 2018-10-16 22:52:51 Schrödingers @Nouriel. Simultaneously an idiot who doesn’t understand options and a genius/Jedi Knight playing mind tricks on the crypto elite.
448 2018-10-16 22:52:45 that caught me off guard 
449 2018-10-16 22:52:29 Binance, it’s platform is simple for me and I hold most my crypto on their exchange.
450 2018-10-16 22:52:10 It’s from a movie lol.
451 2018-10-16 22:52:10 I know you are upset you lost a ton of money top buying this shit but give it up, there's way better opportunity than this premined shit

@AltsQ
475 2018-10-16 22:48:56 You just showed your lack of understanding. XRP is valued at $18.6 billion capitalization. Ox is $451 million. Stop paying attention to the nominal price of an asset.
476 2018-10-16 22:48:51 Trust in the protocol working correctly you mean?  If you mean trust between the node and the contract holder I would assume that the less trust between the two parties the more inclined you'd be to have the full value of the contract escrowed.
477 2018-10-16 22:48:47 LOL!  Great point! The majority of people in Crypto are certainly looking for the Big hitters! If so, God's Eye 2.0 is their ideal running mate
478 2018-10-16 22:48:41 YEAH WELL KEEP WALKING
479 2018-10-16 22:48:36 Right on the app under funds.
480 2018-10-16 22:48:34 Think if it is plausible that @coinbase adds $XRP

Speculation speculation. But they will need to add it if they want to become the biggest place for merchants to buy crypto-assets
481 2018-10-16 22:48:26 So let’s see we have several US banks with stable banking, several Asian banks with stable banking, several European banks with stable banking, a Canadian bank saying they’ll bank crypto, and Bitfinex can’t because there are just no options? Or maybe Bitfinex violated KYC/AML
482 2018-10-16 22:48:24 Although they talk about sharing information on DLTs and its verification by others in the value chain, isn't the key here in tokenizing SME invoices?

It's hard to be sure with Google translate

But it's clear that China gets crypto
483 2018-10-16 22:48:22 I don’t hate anyone, I pity some who are impossible to avoid hearing about. Otherwise I try to follow inspirational accounts. Like you, @AJA_Cortes, @bronzeagemantis and then my feed is rounded out by a smattering of #crypto accounts

498 2018-10-16 22:46:18 yes the same with Litecoin, 99 million took 5 minutes, plus the fee was 40 cents, how can scam banks compete with this? guess what they can't. but they want you to stick with them, crypto is the future of money.

504 2018-10-16 22:45:33 Problem is new coins need volume to make those gains matter, and volume is dead across the board. Alt volume is mostly concentrated on Binance and will need an extended uptrending market to flow to other exchanges rather than being squirreled away into BTC or fiat

508 2018-10-16 22:45:06 Did the exact same thing 2 days ago.
509 2018-10-16 22:45:06 Complete bounties for money, has an active team that doesn’t take years to implement developments. @dragonchaingang has major connections to big enterprise companies, has cross chain compatibility etc. @StellarOrg is way faster is working with IBM, developing a huge ecosystem.
510 2018-10-16 22:45:04 I never felt this was the real crash. Market cap is much too small.
511 2018-10-16 22:45:04 Don’t call her that
512 2018-10-16 22:45:03 Oh really we will see 
513 2018-10-16 22:45:03 I agree. Doesn't matter if we go up or down, either direction will be easily justifiable using precision hindsight techniques.

518 2018-10-16 22:44:22 Please do explain how the common man is supposed to get a leg up with this practice. Maybe this is why people get involved with crypto. You sir are attacking the wrong " cesspool" as you like to call it. You're just trying to keep the poor, poor and you should be ashamed.

520 2018-10-16 22:44:14 Yeah bro, I did it last week.
521 2018-10-16 22:43:57 Its economically quite foolish to state that COSTS create VALUE..

That is what doesnt make sense and the BTC community fails to understand. 

You dont create value by making things expensive.. That makes things still unwanted and expensive.
522 2018-10-16 22:43:51 I don't think Fidelity or ICE likes to sell their customers crypto at this retail range, so dumping is a likely scenario in this episode of the Simpsons...
523 2018-10-16 22:43:42 I like your thinking...

525 2018-10-16 22:43:33 You can exit finnex via crypto or hedge via dai inside finnex. Either way that notice on deposits opening just leads to 100 more questions and speculation.... PR team at finnex really out of touch.

528 2018-10-16 22:43:13 I'm sure bitmex has been under scrutiny for a long time. The fact that its just crypto products and not trading illegal securities of real companies i would imagine makes things a little different, but i'd be careful if i were trading there regardless
529 2018-10-16 22:43:08 Learning about crypto reminds me of watching jazz guitar. My ears and eyes tell me there's something amazing going on. My brain and my fingers tell me, "you'll never be able to do that." My bank account says, "get back to work, idiot."@fintechfrank

533 2018-10-16 22:42:39 Not a smart move.

536 2018-10-16 22:42:31 What scenario would involve the market crashing in the short term with tether scare? 

Only logical scenario to me is exactly what happened.
537 2018-10-16 22:42:20 If crypto is less than 5% of your wealth just weather the storm in btc.  If you have a long term 5 to 10 ywar view then stand strong.  Dumping just adds to the problem

539 2018-10-16 22:42:19 But if your not familiar with crypto logistics you just don't know.. people use litecoin to transfer funds more than any other currency, litecoin is way more liquid than most.

541 2018-10-16 22:42:15 666…悪魔の数字。そうですフリーメイソンです。信じるか信じないかはあなた次第！
542 2018-10-16 22:42:15 How was a crash feasible? Insults already huh? Seems like these crypto twitter trolls have already weakened you. Enjoy your day padawan.
543 2018-10-16 22:41:58 They got me too. Was my first foray into crypto. Let’s just say. It was a good lesson learned.
544 2018-10-16 22:41:41 Why do you think BTC (or crypto in general) will destroy the USD (or fiat in general)?
545 2018-10-16 22:41:39 Coinbase is getting less and less relevant as time goes by. Most people only use coinbase as a gateway into crypto. Their competition is growing all the time so less and less people will use coinbase
546 2018-10-16 22:41:37 That’s him. He saw I was here so he joined in.
547 2018-10-16 22:41:27 Shill it!
548 2018-10-16 22:41:24 I think the high price is what big institutions want anyways so they can be the most used nodes on the network since no plebs will have the money or guts to stake such large amounts needed to secure high value contracts.
549 2018-10-16 22:41:19 You are very good man!
Thank you 
Very tahnx
550 2018-10-16 22:41:16 Over time as trust in the network builds prices will likely drop a little but at the same time the network will pick up in usage making the price still relatively the same. It will be very very valuable digital real estate to own because of the money you can make running a node.
551 2018-10-16 22:41:12 二日酔いがえげつい
552 2018-10-16 22:41:04 How is it useful? It’s slow, cost to much, is heavily manipulated by the big holders and people who got in early. Ethereum has s huge network effect, is useful for smart contracts for enterprise yet still slow. @bounty0x nobody likes this cause it is worth nothing yet you can....
553 2018-10-16 22:41:04 How will you see my impression of him then?
554 2018-10-16 22:41:01 nouriel is like a old pair of shoes.
only way to make something with it is when you‘r throw them over the powercourts hanging above the street.
alot look at them but no one‘s rly giving a fuck @Nouriel
555 2018-10-16 22:41:00 ねえさん、おはよう！
556 2018-10-16 22:40:53 It will almost be like a trial run on the MainNet at first. But as trust builds, I expect node operators to have high escrow staking, acting as the insurance company for smart contracts in a way.
557 2018-10-16 22:40:52 I'm thinking EOY or sooner to break 1 MILLION accounts

562 2018-10-16 22:40:37 That's a good question. I think initially it will be used by companies that already trust each other and have in place dispute resolution mechanisms in case something goes wrong, which is why we see Accord and OpenLaw developing these standards.

571 2018-10-16 22:39:09 At present crypto is the productized version of the underlying technology that uses zero-knowledge proof to solve for trust in a digital platform, and it's creating platforms for applications on top of it. I'd argue it's still a platform, but see your first point

575 2018-10-16 22:38:03 They are now very professional, they speak only about their product because they know it's important to be clean for good Partnerships. Since February, wtc evolved a lot, I'm more and more confident in them every month. The fud was not easy in 2017 but now I really don't care
576 2018-10-16 22:38:00 Yup agreed. I've seen it speculated that they might just force them to keep some amount to be paid as a penalty but it really doesn't make sense to use any amount beside the full value of the contract in question.

584 2018-10-16 22:37:18 That's not a bad idea. I think a month is too short in case they want to hold onto it. I'll probably write something on there that shows it will expire in 10 years. I think that'll be plenty of time for the kids to get into crypto (If they in fact decide to hold onto it ).
585 2018-10-16 22:37:17 I hope it doesn't happen the same in crypto

602 2018-10-16 22:35:04 @Nouriel and his IMF clique destroyed Argentina in the early 2000s and was hard on his way to destroy Greece by instigating undemocratic IMF conditionalities (see e.g. Chris Rogers The IMF and European Economies). Crypto folk need to academically toughen up against these types.
603 2018-10-16 22:34:58 How are the alts more over priced than BTC? Lmao Btc is 6k-7k range. SOME of the alts are severely undervalued compared imo.

634 2018-10-16 22:31:39 My very 1st crypto investment was #TRON nearly 1 year ago. Having seen the bears set in for most of the year. Knowing all the crypto developments from the wider crypto sphere and been so much knowledgeable now than when i 1st started what would i invest in today? The answer TRON
635 2018-10-16 22:31:22 Withdrawing all my XRB from BitGrail as soon as KuCoin opened deposits is easily the best decision I've made in crypto trading.
636 2018-10-16 22:31:18 Tether is supposed to create a spike not a crash. If one is exiting from Tether it’s basically an influx of money back into crypto (mainly BTC). Hope that makes sense.
637 2018-10-16 22:31:03 For the most part I use Price Action & volume with simple S/R for trading, keeping it as simple as possible. But RSI+Stoch RSI are great to spot divergences beginning from lower TFs, which I find very helpful in crypto. Other than that it´s just to much clutter & noise on screen.
638 2018-10-16 22:30:51 We need CENA in crypto

657 2018-10-16 22:26:48 It’s important to note that this rhetorical technique is used in favor for crypto as well.  For a brand new industry a lot act that #tokenizetheworld is a sure thing with very little nuance.

This rhetoric doesn’t help this industry when it goes in either direction.
658 2018-10-16 22:26:09 I hate these ‘fiat backed stable coins’.
It’s like giving up on crypto and agreeing that bitcoin or another crypto won’t ever be stable enough for adoption and so we still have to link back to fiat... the exact opposite reason bitcoin was invented...

668 2018-10-16 22:24:23 What do you guys think they're going to do regarding node escrow?  It seems the only thing that could really prevent bad actors is to have nodes hold the entire value of the contract in escrow to be paid out if they give bad information.

675 2018-10-16 22:23:15 It's not the fastest crypto
676 2018-10-16 22:23:10 That's a great idea. As a proud member of this cesspool, perhaps I shall follow suit...

679 2018-10-16 22:23:01 Wish I saw this earlier. Would have voted for a Kriss Vector 10mm and a Glock 20. Two guns, same ammo. Have the Vector myself and love it.
680 2018-10-16 22:22:59 Any suggestions on game theory/ strategy books?
681 2018-10-16 22:22:47 おはようございます
682 2018-10-16 22:22:18 It is getting a bit annoying. At some point everyone will be blocked though so it should stop.
683 2018-10-16 22:22:15 N0uriel 
684 2018-10-16 22:22:14 You still in denial man?
685 2018-10-16 22:22:04 Love it it’s so $hot when you do that
686 2018-10-16 22:21:53 If you manage to get ~4.5 times a 3x on a coin or ~7times a 2x on a coin you have 100x you initial capital. As an example the majority of the coins on binance are at least going to 2x so you have plenty of opportunity. The catch is to know how to time everything.
687 2018-10-16 22:21:52 Shiiii
688 2018-10-16 22:21:44 is zrx actually working?
689 2018-10-16 22:21:36 I’ve tried to get my old man into crypto. He is single and on decent pay.
He doesn’t understand the tech, so won’t touch it. 
I think this is the epitome of the general public.

Most people don’t even invest in anything besides their own house.
Not counting managed superfunds.
690 2018-10-16 22:21:24 im downloading it right now it just takes forever thx to #turkeyfirewall

692 2018-10-16 22:21:10 If China were to weaponize bitcoin, what would they gain?

Am I missing something? Wouldn't it break everyone's trust in the network?

Aka the price plummets without a reason to bounce back up.

703 2018-10-16 22:19:55 They can list whatever they choose. As I understand it, this is the double-edged sword of crypto: if it’s not a security, they aren’t bound by the same insider-trading laws. That said, why anyone would still use Coinbase is beyond me! They are shady as hell.

708 2018-10-16 22:19:10 I think Detailed information should already here if you make this step. I mean why supernodes are needed in a Decentralised system? Why are the normal nodes capable of doing this as was then actual plan? Ok all holder should vote, but why supernodes?
709 2018-10-16 22:18:47 I know Tron has done everything it said,but whales will see how many people hold trx which is pretty much everyone in crypto atm n continue to hold it down n shake out the weak for along time to come,as i said the hype can have a very negative effect

721 2018-10-16 22:16:50 Coinbase’s decisions are just getting weirder and weirder! Let’s just hope they are playing by all legal rules as if they get caught or shutdown because of some irregularities, like then or not it will cause chaos in the crypto space!
722 2018-10-16 22:16:36 Damn eh
723 2018-10-16 22:16:27 what about $ZEL?

726 2018-10-16 22:16:13 good for you on $QNT presale, well I got in 50% below you in eth terms
727 2018-10-16 22:16:08 True, but the hoddling meme is dead....I expect people to take profits. 
Don't think we are going to have the mass retail investor pump like last year. But plebs are plebs so who knows, my bags are packed!
728 2018-10-16 22:16:07 #thanks
729 2018-10-16 22:15:36 Yes, correct, crypto is being manipulated, pumped, dumped, with 1,000s of scams... but why do you even care? It's a tiny tiny speck of a market in the global economy (which I thought you were an expert on?)

753 2018-10-16 22:11:49 I think like the last one where it stays in a small range for 1-2 days before further movement but that could change quickly in the crypto land

755 2018-10-16 22:11:45 That 55B you're referring to is locked up in escrow, they can never sell more than 1B XRP per month. They've never come close to selling that. Q2 they sold 300M. A fraction of that. "Why not burn it?" Because why the hell would they? They're using it to grow the market/ecosystem.

764 2018-10-16 22:10:22 Yes, absolutely, depending on how price gets there. I'd rather short lower or much higher. And I'd short $ETH not $BTC. Here I'm long.

781 2018-10-16 22:07:57 This embodies all that is wrong with crypto. Lack of transparency and misappropriation of funds.  And yet, we paid $20 to be members of the coop. #getthestrap
782 2018-10-16 22:07:56 I think this sums up trading crypto perfectly. Every trade feels like a jump into the unknown 
783 2018-10-16 22:07:41 spending a minute on their site and firing back basic questions isn't research. anyway good luck to you and i'm sure plenty of silent readers get the value at hand.
784 2018-10-16 22:07:33 For sure. Nouriel blocked me almost immediately. There are only a few people on crypto twitter interested in actually learning from active dialogue. You are one of them.
785 2018-10-16 22:07:33 Sorry for misunderstanding - I'm with you Boba I was asking @kcyr_k why he thought .guv would be interested in shutting down PIVX and how could they possibly if PIVX is decentralized and private (his logic is flawed, respectfully Kenny)
786 2018-10-16 22:07:28 In other words accumulating doge coin is equivalent to wasting money and most of the money in crypto is made by being an an early adopter of large projects e.g with investment in ICOs or STOs
787 2018-10-16 22:07:26 You won the internet today 
788 2018-10-16 22:07:17 I can't help but wonder if after you inadvertently showed everyone your passwords while streaming and then had a tons of $ and BTC taken from you, did you then try to do anything about it? Or warn anyone? When you told someone did they give you a smug response like that? (4)
789 2018-10-16 22:07:11 at this level possible becuse some  atls down  from 20 to 55x

799 2018-10-16 22:05:47 2) In western countries where the majority have access to high level banking, crypto has some use cases but isn’t superior to fiat in every way yet. We need stability and user adoption and that is only a matter of time.
800 2018-10-16 22:05:46 Yes
801 2018-10-16 22:05:18 Do you think 100xing a balance in an alt szn is possible anymore?
802 2018-10-16 22:05:06 Again, naming them and explaining the relationships helps everyone in the crypto space better understand the current situation. It is not only about Bitfinex customers

I think @novogratz is fantastic for #crypto but the predictions are dangerous! We’ve all been there.
812 2018-10-16 22:02:58 It’s quite simple really. CC transactions are in fiat - the exact cash that business owners spend in.  Until there’s wider adoption of crypto, business owners aren’t going to put up with 10-20% swings in the price of crypto, often within an hour.

860 2018-10-16 21:56:46 It would be good if you provided your customers with crypto security SHA256 standard or SSH keys to secure their accounts this can be easily introduced provide speed and security to your customers.
861 2018-10-16 21:56:42 You are very welcome !
862 2018-10-16 21:56:37 I use Robinhood for other stocks but not for Crypto yet. Can you purchase on Robinhood and then move it off their platform?
863 2018-10-16 21:56:14 Until crypto becomes accepted tender for day-to-day purchases, we'll need a stable coin to isolate crypto investments from large swings.
864 2018-10-16 21:56:14 He does kind of have creepy expression on his face.

Like he's witnessing something horrific.
865 2018-10-16 21:56:13 I mean, you yourself got hacked and lost a ton of money I'm sure.. and now I'm letting you know that there are people going through your videos and pretending to be you and swindling people out of thousands of dollars... (2)
866 2018-10-16 21:56:03 CC cost 3-7% for the merchant. Why do people still argue that credit cards, centralized companies, are better than p2p cash? "Cash back" means higher fees and prices, do you think that "cash back" and loyalty points are free money?
867 2018-10-16 21:56:02 exactly, cryptos are an investment vehicle *not* money. why would you invest in a crypto? bc you hope you can cash out for usd or eur. and since you're gaging its value against usd or eur, it's effectively a pegged currency.
868 2018-10-16 21:55:52 $NFLX doing that good old #Crypto thing

891 2018-10-16 21:52:19 
892 2018-10-16 21:52:18 I agree with you here, I’m with these guys in principal on about 90% of what they say. But that last 10% is more destructive than anything. There is no scenario where BTC exists without a thriving altcoin ecosystem like it or not. I’ve yet to meet a crypto expert.
893 2018-10-16 21:52:14 $BTCUSD levels: 6850, 6650-6600, 6400, 6250, 6150. I like longs above 6400, and shorts below 6250. Fact that Tether crash made crypto spike rather than crash was bullish.
894 2018-10-16 21:52:06 Nonsense 
2017 ATH of crypto was purely led by individual investors, no institutions. Crypto achieved a valuation of $800 billion.

Fidelity Digital Assets head Tom Jessop told Forbes it recognizes demand from hedge funds and sophisticated investors

Its up from here on

Yep, today is the day Dan decided to begin bullshitting people.
909 2018-10-16 21:49:50 Unbelievably Awesome!! Wonder why institutions are powering through the door to be a part of the crypto revolution!!??!! 
Actions speak LOUDER
910 2018-10-16 21:49:47 those price predictions were made with the expectations institutions would jump in this year. they didn’t. but now with Fidelity and its 27 million customers, offering a custodial solution for crypto by end of Q1 2019...the herd is coming.
911 2018-10-16 21:49:37 Ouch!Therein lies the craziness that is crypto bookmaking. You always got to take it up a level 
912 2018-10-16 21:49:32 The beauty of crypto is moves like that dont take years. They only take a few weeks.
913 2018-10-16 21:49:28 Still haven’t managed to figure out Revolut! it’s euros here as well so not much hassle
914 2018-10-16 21:49:24 Is it finally potato or potatoe?
915 2018-10-16 21:49:20 Granted, ZRX is a strange (pointless) coin to be listing but XRP holders are the worst community in crypto, you’re like vegans!
916 2018-10-16 21:49:17 うーん20点！
917 2018-10-16 21:49:14 I hope y'all know that crypto is still very much alive.
918 2018-10-16 21:48:57 It's the only thing that SHOULD matter, but you gotta play into the average market participant's perspective on some things. New money tends to chase "cheap" coins because they like the idea of being able to own "a lot" of something. 100% mental.

927 2018-10-16 21:47:46 "This banking information" what information? It's reffering to something else. What is that disclaimer disclaiming for?
928 2018-10-16 21:47:39 can you send a link? All I remember is them saying they would provide a solution to it after WTC tweeted that they would do it....

936 2018-10-16 21:47:07 Plus don’t forget Chris Larsen was one of the richest people in the world when XRP was almost $4. One of the richest people in the world for co-founding something which is not even being used! If that doesn’t show you XRP was created out of thin air nothing will.
937 2018-10-16 21:46:56 No, but I'm beginning to think you may be. Back up your assertions or stop wasting my time with dribble.
938 2018-10-16 21:46:49 Or we could simply give up this false belief that anyone has a right to rule over others. 
All governments are illegitimate. The only thing that keeps them alive is a belief in authority and the right to rule. 
Blow that smoke away and you’ll see them for the con men they are.

942 2018-10-16 21:45:55 Your body replaces all of it's cells every 7 years.

Crypto is probably quite similar, those who disconnect now will have done so in the future regardless.

Also, I'm quite protective of my energy and who I share it with, you & I shouldn't feel bad about blocking negativity.
943 2018-10-16 21:45:52 Btc and a slice of EOS
944 2018-10-16 21:45:40 Yup. That's why I'm stocking upon bitcoin energy.

951 2018-10-16 21:43:53 ‘Just happen’ yeah. So will the 2/3rds of all XRP, which is currently held by Ripple never end up in the market? If that’s the case, why don’t they just burn it? If it will end up in the market it will first have to be sold by them.

953 2018-10-16 21:43:14 My theory - crypto is just a way for rich men to hide their money from the divorce courts. They can pass it between themselves for safe keeping.

956 2018-10-16 21:43:02 Is it finally $xrp or ripple?
957 2018-10-16 21:42:39 Crypto is essential for country like Libya in other places its another option in an already good working banking system. Bitcoin isn’t like other crypto and if we treat other coins like bitcoin we will fail but to use them to have an independent banking solution is the way to go
958 2018-10-16 21:42:38 Because you are on your last legs of being relevant to anyone anywhere at any time and Crypto is just the place to stir up some misinformation into your favor? Not hard to see... Try as you might though, We'll see you on the other side again just like your $58 btc price ;)
959 2018-10-16 21:42:38 Yeah, if @fluffypony non-ironically called himself BTC maximalist while working on @monero that is pretty weird.

As for the loose definition of word terrorist - I guess it's on par with calling everything else in crypto a scam :)
960 2018-10-16 21:42:29 To add to this, let's assume a crypto like XRP is used as currency. How can one lend XRP without the XRP being legitimately transferred? No substitute is possible. Any IOUs issued on the ledger are just that, IOUs. They wouldn't be accepted as money like the real thing.
961 2018-10-16 21:42:06 Crypto is so incredibly small. Without each other, we got nothing. It’s us versus the world. Us versus each other is time poorly spent.
962 2018-10-16 21:42:02 wish i could invest in yisus's meme game as if it were stock / crypto
963 2018-10-16 21:41:55 The non-mining nodes on the Bitcoin network also verify transactions and prevent double-spends. The miners additionally create this link between the physical and digital world that adds immutability to the blockchain, since an equal amount of work would need to be done to undo it
964 2018-10-16 21:41:47 I don't agree with @jimmysong on this, or only partly.
Cryptos need Usage for Adoption.
And not through bitpay instantly converted to fiat-fake.
A Crypto Eco-System will reveal the Real Value of Cryptos.

966 2018-10-16 21:41:42 Thanks, we are working on this at the moment, hopefully it should be back up soon.
967 2018-10-16 21:41:22 @ALQOCOIN has gone from the very beginning of the crypto dev process, through a sometimes rough coin development phase, quite advanced wallet dev phase, the legal step and dev steps for an exchange deployment. Technically I've seen no other project do anything comparable.
968 2018-10-16 21:41:01 Extremely Low Volume on Binance for #TRX  and other Alt's, not looking good at All. Might get to buy me some more at .02 or less.

978 2018-10-16 21:39:37 all in
979 2018-10-16 21:39:17 I believe we can bring crypto mainstream by bridging the gaps between communities, by educating and protecting the newcomers and, above all, by gaining the industry some trustworthiness.

980 2018-10-16 21:39:13 well no you have to judge them on their merits the same way you would compare stocks and shares on mcap, development and TA etc
981 2018-10-16 21:39:04 The best (read: most ridiculous) phrase you will see anywhere on $crypto Reddit is "Exactly. People don't understand this..." to justify whatever their crazy angle is. Even if they're wrong they'll say you are. you know.. cuz you "don't understand this.." 
982 2018-10-16 21:39:04 Or a very fast hell:)   I kicked ass last few years though.  I only play NBA.  

P.S.  Im still an idiot.  Looking at some of those early 2016 bets is embarrassingly comical. I kept some for fun but crypto was no doubt not my thing back then!  BTC to USD asap always back then:/
983 2018-10-16 21:39:02 #traders #crypto holders we should all   Just take extra care and not play into the hands of another BANK who is controlling the market #CryptocurrencyNews
984 2018-10-16 21:38:51 Partially correct. As time goes on, the difficulty of finding the correct hash to add a new block to the blockchain intentionally increases. When a miner succeeds and discovers the hash, it is digital proof that a certain amount of energy was expended in the physical world.
985 2018-10-16 21:38:48 @coinbase when #zrx crypto coinbase bundle?   /s

damn, that's a mouthful
986 2018-10-16 21:38:33 With my crypto, always reply with, "It's actually on sale right now, so I've been buying more. By the way, how are your investments coming along?"
987 2018-10-16 21:38:17 Thanks! Happy to hear that. Lets see how it goes.
988 2018-10-16 21:38:17 put it this way @Blocktradecom have around 100 lined up for next year and are utilising $CHX #dsr and management platform for all their #equity #security admin

look at my #infodeck and watch the latest AMA in full with ceo @Ragtschaa

990 2018-10-16 21:37:56 They pretend everyone else gets a hand out.
They got the dark money.
Online donation? 
Crypto? 
Same ppl jacking phones allover aus?
991 2018-10-16 21:37:56 Some people purchase crypto for what it is.

Others purchase it for the dream of what could be.

The former is no more important than the latter.

993 2018-10-16 21:37:41 Sensory overload 
I’m sure that little dude has some huge team supplied by Ma and the Chinese government and they are just moving full steam ahead. China may not like crypto but they do like control.
994 2018-10-16 21:37:15 true, many of that low cap stuff already up 4-6x

better opportunities else where aside from those that haven't pumped

999 2018-10-16 21:36:25 Haha, wtf, how is that manageable?
1000 2018-10-16 21:36:20 @Dashpay developed the 1st DAO in history.  It’s “still around” bc it has a split block reward treasury controlled by a decentralized body that directs miners, dev teams and marketing, keeping the most active community in crypto miles ahead
1001 2018-10-16 21:36:08 I saw one site that accepts bitcoin, but that isn’t even anonymous unless your wallet computer is on a VPN. Maybe they will accept one of the other more anonymous crypto currencies soon.

1011 2018-10-16 21:34:41 You are entirely misinformed and unwilling to accept education on the space. As far as all of crypto is concerned, your opinion is completely worthless and misguided
1012 2018-10-16 21:34:38 yes, why other cryptos when i invested in another one, haha
1013 2018-10-16 21:34:36 How many equity offerings do they have lined up to use their platform?
1014 2018-10-16 21:34:34 That's the problem. This difference in premium needs to hurry and get corrected. Binance will have to make a change because I'm sure users are feeling real skeptical with the price difference in it's main USD pair and no official announcement from @cz_binance
1015 2018-10-16 21:34:32 Its 100% anonymous, because @PIVX is the first #crypto project which managed to develop stealth address staking & Masternodes, combining the strengths of POS with zerocoin protocol. Tx fees from zDEX will be rewarded to zDEXNodes (MNs that also help secure zDEX) -> passive income
1016 2018-10-16 21:34:29 You’re wrong @Crypto_Bitlord This is the bottom for sure!!  I’m putting all my BTC in BitRext and leveraging long 100x.  No stop loss!!  Leroy Jenkins!!!!!!
1017 2018-10-16 21:34:22 XRP does have more utility than BTC though... how does BTC have more utility than XRP?

1020 2018-10-16 21:33:50 @Dereek70
1021 2018-10-16 21:33:46 Launch of custody solutions = means for big banks to securely hold assets for their clients. They don’t give a shit if clients want to buy at 6k or 100k. If anything a bull market means more business managing client $$. A crypto bear is not in fidelity/intercontinental interests
1022 2018-10-16 21:33:37 It's not necessarily bearish either, research shows they break down 64% of the time and up 36% of the time. When incorporated the volume analysis, I'm more bullish than bearish.

1087 2018-10-16 21:23:40 Domestic USD funding means USD deposits & withdrawals for people within the US. Same idea as domestic flight vs international flight ;)

As a non-US client, you can still sell XBT for USD, but you cannot withdraw that USD. You can use the USD to buy another crypto.

1089 2018-10-16 21:23:27 The BTC community is well aware of the big "Chinese elephant" in the room and prefers to ignore it  or dscard it a FUD instead of debating about a salution. Geopolitics cannot and should not be ignored in crypto.

1091 2018-10-16 21:22:51 @FiverrSupport can your website get any worse? You could do with hiring some folk to make it compatible with mobile devices. Will not let me hit submit after entering phone verify code. What a waste of time.
1092 2018-10-16 21:22:45 why $POLY when $CHX beats them in everyway technically? the only advantage poly has it's the amount of money raised for general marketing but its a 50x just for @OwnMarket to get to the current poly MCAP
1093 2018-10-16 21:22:44 @GUAMillionaire I hear you have some solid events in the Crypto space, please consider @TheTicketFairy when you can.
1094 2018-10-16 21:22:43 Maybe if you have a friend who has a trick-or-treating child, AND is curious about crypto, you can offer an extra "treat" (and take the time to explain how it's not a trick!). It's still early days, but you can try.

1099 2018-10-16 21:22:05 They are willing to accept the risk so they went in not forced. There is freedom 

I have lost too in crypto but that wouldn't make me quit
1100 2018-10-16 21:21:57 How am I wrong, please elaborate.
1101 2018-10-16 21:21:52 doesn't matter it's the only sub $5 coin on coinbase it'll be the coin of choice for people starting in crypto  dreaming of more than 3x gains
1102 2018-10-16 21:21:43 Got a drawer full, but all black.
1103 2018-10-16 21:21:07 PoWs only role is to secure the blockchain to prevent double spends and validate transactions. It is massively resource intensive as it relies on brute force calculations in order to achieve this. Nobody would participate in PoW without a reward or compensation. That's mining.

1110 2018-10-16 21:19:36 True, but they will end up hand-picking the top 21 as whoever they vote for will get automatically selected as top 30 BPs. That is not a great outcome either. Can they vote with partial account? That seems not possible with the frozen account.

1143 2018-10-16 21:15:12 It really isn't a big deal because it's been known for quite a while as #zrx seems to be tailored to comply with Coinbase's Digital Asset Framework. Just a temporary spike in volume that's gonna go down again in a matter of days, much like Ethereum Classic.

1158 2018-10-16 21:13:47 Agree that financial literacy needs improvement, but the “accredited investor” thing is a scam to reduce competition for higher-return (& sometimes higher-risk) investments.  W/ honest info & disclosures the average Joe can make those decisions. Crypto lacks this though, lol
1159 2018-10-16 21:13:40 Ahh nice
1160 2018-10-16 21:13:39 Interesting bro, it sounds like you might be starting to warm towards the idea of a bull run so big that it induces institutional fomo... 

Personally I think that as soon as the market cap hits 1 Trillion, it will trigger something bigger than any bubble we’ve ever seen #hopium
1161 2018-10-16 21:13:32 Stable coins will likely hit the masses first but this will (onboard) a lot of people into holding at least some Crypto in their digital wallets.

Once people get their first stable coins it's then very easy to switch out some or all to deflationary Crypto coin inside the wallet.
1162 2018-10-16 21:13:20 I've got a sell limit at 13100
1163 2018-10-16 21:13:07 You telling me dat picture not you?
1164 2018-10-16 21:13:02 Really?. This would be a good thing not a bad 
1165 2018-10-16 21:13:02 Mark, people can use that line of analysis (or a similar one) to question the entire crypto space but we both know this is a false narrative. Same thing for Netflix which is totally revolutionising how high quality entertainment is produced and distributed

1173 2018-10-16 21:11:45 How about a stable coin pegged to the price of living in a place for 1 day? 

If I have 30 tokens I can live for 30 days. 

Would make it a lot more clear what it really represents. And make it easier to plan life.

1182 2018-10-16 21:10:51 Venezuelan Petro /crypto is only a scam made by government to extend their control, corruption and an attempt to go around the sanctions which are only against specific individuals with proved criminal records.  Big mistake to use Venezuela example as positive crypto case

1217 2018-10-16 21:04:40 Não sei pq vc usa o prefixo de CRYPTO sendo q não existe NADA no seu eprfil q denote q vc SABE ou ESTUDE algo sobre isso.

1220 2018-10-16 21:04:31 I bought AAPL in 1999 because I believed in it. I’m still HODLing. If you believe in crypto, pick up some $BTC.  While you can. It doesn’t and shouldn’t make up your full portfolio.
1221 2018-10-16 21:04:19 I fooled you.
1222 2018-10-16 21:04:14 Good. That means my money is secure.
Plus given the nature of PoW, does no one realize that crypto mining companies would have a STRONG incentive to pursue renewable resources?
1223 2018-10-16 21:04:12 nope my push settings for coinbase are all active. never received one not for etc and not for zrx
1224 2018-10-16 21:04:04 You play by the rules but you are not allowed to buy $ZRX on Coinbase because you live in NYC - but you can buy it on every other exchange = some form of Crypto-Discrimination

1226 2018-10-16 21:03:47 Bilinçli kalıyorsun. ETH düşecek alt düşecek , bunu bilsen bile gecemiyorsun BTC ye . Hacim büyük olunca imkansız. Uzun süre çıkmayacağım coinlere giriyorum sadece. Al sat olayı bizden geçti.

1229 2018-10-16 21:03:44 This is great for crypto!
1230 2018-10-16 21:03:41 Since crypto is a technology that supports a few different types of platforms, and many believe that the industry or existing coins might fail, I'm wondering if there's an analagous tech/platform that failed
1231 2018-10-16 21:03:41 Socks are for noobs
1232 2018-10-16 21:03:37 #crypto conspiracy: @coinbase partners with @facebook using $ZRX as the settlement layer in an effort to “tokenize the world”.   +2B people and Zico sticks it to the Winklevoss twins by not pumping $BTC (in the immediate future)
1233 2018-10-16 21:03:37 There is a proper time for everything. Not a trader, hence I prefer to keep $BTC keep dollar cost averaging into #crypto. Not planning on spending any until it get accepted by a “non-chain” grocery store downstairs.

1239 2018-10-16 21:03:08 Bet you love a bit of crypto too 
1240 2018-10-16 21:03:05 BTC to 50K, one pair of shoes at a time. I think that's how it works...
1241 2018-10-16 21:02:55 I agree and yeah that's great man, please continue :)
1242 2018-10-16 21:02:54 Stupid job making me miss this tweet. Hadn’t been following $ZRX closely enough and this would have been the perfect buy, even without the knowledge of it being listed today.

1259 2018-10-16 21:01:26 HODLing is part of the using of crypto. It brings price discovery. If everyone doesn’t sell, price goes up. If everybody sells price goes down.

1265 2018-10-16 21:00:26 There are competitors, as there will always be in a lucrative space.

Also LINK has alot of features for users

1285 2018-10-16 20:59:22 People don’t understand or grasp market cap until they fall deeper into understanding what crypto is

Notice how the largest communities tend to gravitate towards the “low price” coins

It’s unfortunate how that works, but it’s nonetheless a reality
1286 2018-10-16 20:59:19 5 Reasons (other than tech) to be excited about the not-so-distant future of crypto:

1. Bakkt 
2. Pending ETF
3. Fidelity, et al
4. Eventual lift of Chinese crypto regulations
5. Ability for average citizens to invest in global asset class

1288 2018-10-16 20:59:13 As you can tell, I like to engage in any conversation I can on the platform - only way accounts like mine get noticed.

A lot of people in Crypto came from the traditional trading/ financial institutions.
A lot of people in traditional trading came from poker/gambling.
At the end of the day it's all a game for most, with that said.

KNOW THE RULES AND PLAY IT WELL..

1312 2018-10-16 20:55:22 From Tom Lee at Fundstrat - - -
With Fidelity launching a comprehensive range of services,  it is adding to the avalanche of evidence that institutional participation in crypto is the story of 2019.  (1/3)
1313 2018-10-16 20:55:16 Still, It's more of a self test, not a "what are others going to think about it". If you, after thinking twice, consider it worthy of ur time / valuable, then you probably should post it.
1314 2018-10-16 20:55:13 What is the point of diversifying in Crypto? If bitcoin falls, all fall. Its mostly one coin that drags all with it.
1315 2018-10-16 20:54:51 Alqo
1316 2018-10-16 20:54:47 Excellent point.  Algo management especially is a part that most people that don't consider.  AI might be another story, but maybe the same considerations apply there too.

1327 2018-10-16 20:52:44 1-It seems like the only money that’s going into crypto right now are current holders moving from different crypto’s (Tether to BTC for example). ZRX just listed on Coinbase and is only up 13%. Tezos is up 10% today. There’s just not enough NEW money coming into the space.

1360 2018-10-16 20:48:28 But fortunately life is a massive open world and rich, retired and an awesome family is totally an option 
1361 2018-10-16 20:48:13 Great answer!
1362 2018-10-16 20:47:50 great project, Awesome and very well organized community.
1363 2018-10-16 20:47:38 The third is a very strange worry IMO. If BTC works as intended backs will hols/use BTC as well. I don't see any problem with banks holding crypto. 

 Finally, banks aren't holding significant amounts of XRP right now, which was your claim.

1411 2018-10-16 20:41:49 Big difference between education and wisdom. I also think that ‘educated’ is a relative term. Even if he turns to be right about crypto and blockchain, many of the statements he’s made are factually incorrect. He may think bitcoin a scam, but Ponzi is incorrect by definition.

1421 2018-10-16 20:40:41 I think $zrx is one of the safest trades in all of #crypto over the next 6 months to a year
1422 2018-10-16 20:40:38 Because banks are increasingly deciding not to deal with crypto related businesses.

1427 2018-10-16 20:40:08 It's been a fun year. 2017 was killer for me to, Did a lot. Also, if you go to dubai without me I'm un-friending in real life 
1428 2018-10-16 20:40:03 There's a big difference between a crypto portfolio and a bankroll for trading

A portfolio should be in cold storage with private keys in your hands. A bankroll should be on exchange or easy fiat on ramp so you can react to the insanity

Confusing the two can be catastrophic
1429 2018-10-16 20:39:59 Dude I really dig you for saying things out loud.
"Optimistically cautious" is a beautiful way to put it and warning the masses not to follow the CT sentiment atm....

1474 2018-10-16 20:33:53 they said to bank  we not buy crypto or what ?
1475 2018-10-16 20:33:50 So if Fidelity buys up 30% of the available ETH its blockchain is no longer decentralised? 

The goal of crypto is giving everyone a chance to be part of the global economy. And the freedom to have as much or as little as you want/can afford.
1476 2018-10-16 20:33:50 "Underclass" means what exactly? Sorry, I'm not up on crypto-Marxist jargon.

1504 2018-10-16 20:30:58 I mean, every single turd that's come out of my butthole has literally been unique. here, have a participation award 
1505 2018-10-16 20:30:45 I think the hardware wallet market is a good proxy for these people who care about the features of crypto vs just making money. 1M seems like a good order of magnitude, in contrast to the “more users than Schwab” numbers we hear re exchanges. We’ll see if that grows.

1510 2018-10-16 20:29:46 Since the crypto space is infested with over hype, I try to give a non hyped prediction. Of course, the more you invest, the sooner lambo level will come.

1514 2018-10-16 20:29:30 Why is it fraud in Crypto...but not so with Fiats, Wall street, and banks who pump and dump on the typical individual investor? The greatest frauds and pyramids are the banks and their fiats.  We no longer trust banks/bankers. So smug you guys.
1515 2018-10-16 20:29:25 İ think if it go up there is resistance at 320 sats
1516 2018-10-16 20:29:23 2x poverty lol, find the low cap gems and you get the big money on the next run
1517 2018-10-16 20:28:54 Yeap. Another rich kid who got in early, trying to justify his fraudulent gains. Even if crypto was something useful, with these people around it would sure collapse.

1526 2018-10-16 20:28:26 Some questions I've been asking myself before replying to posts:

- Is it at least funny?

If I can't answer yes to 1, I prob shouldn't reply

whowhohahaheha
1527 2018-10-16 20:28:25 i wouldn’t expect them to ask these questions. Users must not trust anyone but their full node and their ability to protect their private keys.
1528 2018-10-16 20:28:23 I guess is time to buy then all these while through out this year i have never seen you be this skeptical that means its going up
1529 2018-10-16 20:28:17 Thanks for the info my dude
1530 2018-10-16 20:28:17 Not even close to what were seeing right now. Its actual big institutions, congressional hearings and government regulations made for it. No where near 2015
1531 2018-10-16 20:27:51 Valid!
1532 2018-10-16 20:27:34  "I think the most important metric is developer mindshare, at least for the smart contract platforms...good developers, in my experience, [are] not mercenaries, they're missionaries"

 Loved hearing @1kxnetwork's @lalleclausen share his thoughts on #Ethereum w/ @CryptomanRan
1533 2018-10-16 20:27:31 Last December, people were ganging up on me because they said I should have pushed them more to get into $crypto

Now I tell them to buy the dip and nobody’s interested anymore 

This stuff ain’t for everybody

1539 2018-10-16 20:26:51 Even if you don't think you add value, people on twitter appreciate engagement.
1540 2018-10-16 20:26:50 Correct! But you need to own one in order to use it lol.
1541 2018-10-16 20:26:49 They should make it available to purchase with crypto now that would be great
1542 2018-10-16 20:26:48 Btc then swing/day trade trending alts with tight stop losses 
1543 2018-10-16 20:26:37 I posted this on twitter before already and might do again
1544 2018-10-16 20:26:35 I favor tokens that are not PoW.  PoW protocols are not needed as there are other ways to secure the networks and in the process do not harm the environment/transfer or convert electricity to values.  I've made up my minds on this....
1545 2018-10-16 20:26:30 Look like she broke the bank's terms & "conditions" (no crypto business). Banks are now gods - you don't mess with them. This is why I'm not going to "cash out" on this next bull run. Don't want to be a banking slave. F gov fiat money.
1546 2018-10-16 20:26:27 Ahhh the hilarity. Just a few yrs ago, #GOP was mocked for having SO many candidates for nomination. In 2020, #DNC will have more nominees than the GOP did
1547 2018-10-16 20:26:21 Not like 2015 at all, we have insanely bullish news coming out all the time. Back then crypto was still seen as shady
1548 2018-10-16 20:26:19 Never enter a trade without a stop-loss. R/r at these levels is insane because it's an easy cut if it breaks that support
1549 2018-10-16 20:26:17 trust your preparation and education, and block out the noise.

1550 2018-10-16 20:26:02 Our crypto math was off! We carried a 2, added a decimal point and subtracted an Enfield Horror I think we included the sighting at Channing Pond in 1972, which was later recanted
1551 2018-10-16 20:26:02 With the occasional tweet like this, I wonder what kind of vocal force for good @rogerkver might have been for Bitcoin if he hadn’t gone all greedy and weird by trying to launch BCash.  #BCrash #bitcoin #bcash #altcoins

1554 2018-10-16 20:25:47 cause coinbase is a Goldmann Sachs scam sucking of money from crypto market basing on sentiment of "coinbase pump". Now it is game over  and no I'm not sorry at all. They will analyze many times what CZ did to beat them.. when it will be too late 
1555 2018-10-16 20:25:45 This is great
1556 2018-10-16 20:25:43 Hahahaha, isn't that why they make breaker bars?
1557 2018-10-16 20:25:43 Agree totally. “even” the free “trendmaster” on tradingview is beautiful and top btw.. Kudos to @IchimokuScholar
1558 2018-10-16 20:25:37 Really
1559 2018-10-16 20:25:33 I agree. Finding this space in February 2018 drastically altered my life for the better. I honestly can't express how grateful I am. If I make a ton of money I want to help people.
1560 2018-10-16 20:25:21 And just like Ethereum Classic isn’t the cheapest crypto asset on Coinbase anymore! Let them noobs buy into 0x!
(Not hating on ZRX btw but the fact is, it is the cheapest asset on the app which means that newbies can purchase more of it than e.g. LTC) 
Praying ppl do get my point
1561 2018-10-16 20:25:11 Facboook new algo removed the interests (brands, magazines, associations etc) that I was targetting to sell products to my customers. I stopped Ecom and got into crypto trading. Was a tought year but I learned a lot. Adapt or die.

1563 2018-10-16 20:25:03 Fiat crypto would be interesting. Debit cards have failed to penetrate into India. Crypto just needs a mobile phone which max Indians have. A government backed fiat crypto currency would give a huge push to the digital India initiative

1564 2018-10-16 20:25:00 Wow am surprised mr fluffy even entertained this conversation between 2 fools who lack any substance in the crypto scene.
1565 2018-10-16 20:24:55 What’s even funnier? You know them and they are for sure from Arkansas
1566 2018-10-16 20:24:33 Mostly a problem with crypto than a problem with your app. Most people hold bags on exchanges and trade there. They aren't using their addresses all that much. However, still, what are you currently trying to get early users? Also, how does this make you money?
1567 2018-10-16 20:24:27 Ils ne sont pas ouvert.

1582 2018-10-16 20:22:27 I was looking into types of crypto assets.The one below (J. Ryan, Hackernoon) contains the most types: 
1) reserve 
2) cryptocurrencies 
3) platform tokens 
4) utility tokens 
5) security tokens 
6) crypto commodities 
7) appcoins 
8) stable coins. 
Do you know any more?

1608 2018-10-16 20:19:20 Nice, can't wait till that spreads to other countries. It's coming. Japan was one of the first countries to recognize crypto and legitimize it through sensible regulation.
1609 2018-10-16 20:19:17 As I understand it is a lot has to do with the lack of certainty regarding what crypto is and what it isn't.  Once there is guidance there may be platforms to margin trade, so long as those platforms are regulated by one of the above bodies.

Rawls was a crypto-Reaganite while Marx is, well, Marx - but both assign more or less absolute priority to the interests of the least advantaged social group
1617 2018-10-16 20:18:24 People are curious and they try their chances. Once more info is available, guess they'll be more involved. Plus, it's nice to have the quiz relevant to the current buzz in crypto. Keep it up!  And bring on the info 
1618 2018-10-16 20:18:24 I've already climbed to the moon, cleaning windows. Now it's time for crypto to do their part ! 
1619 2018-10-16 20:18:11 A better question would be "What can be done to protect exchange users?"

1644 2018-10-16 20:16:20 Yeah there’s a whole inverse of this particular question in the opposite macro vein which is: who uses a state backed crypto to be more globally competitive/open up new revenue. Super fascinating.
1645 2018-10-16 20:16:18 SHA not gem? 
1646 2018-10-16 20:16:06 I'd advice you to communicate with exchanges and those people who are actually aware of laws instead of asking someone who doesn't even know anything about crypto's or current law situation.

1679 2018-10-16 20:13:10 Interesting that a glimmer of hope in the crypto markets appears the day after the 2017 US tax deadline. We'll see how this plays out.
1680 2018-10-16 20:13:04 So no Pro Tips?
1681 2018-10-16 20:12:52 Not at this point. They can only force you to pay taxes in fiat.
1682 2018-10-16 20:12:49 Where do you see bitcoin in 6 months time? What are your thoughts on crypto currency?

1686 2018-10-16 20:12:32 I need it to make sense
1687 2018-10-16 20:12:30 Am not seeing those Welcome to Crypto tweets yet.
1688 2018-10-16 20:12:29 + 1.589 @xrptipbot
1689 2018-10-16 20:12:04 The people on social/reddit/etc that are pissed off about $doge not being listed on Coinbase are another prime example of pump and dumpers in the crypto space. You completely missed the fun and silliness of Doge if you're crying that your coins aren't pumping soon on CB
1690 2018-10-16 20:11:59 @Nouriel's tweets highlight the tragedy that is early onset dementia. I think the crypto community should come together and donate much needed funds for research to put an end to this affliction.
1691 2018-10-16 20:11:57 6400 where???
1692 2018-10-16 20:11:51 That s a liquidity problem, not something that retail cares about.
1693 2018-10-16 20:11:48 Only at meet ups
1694 2018-10-16 20:11:46 I think there is like 1 gazillion tokens.
1695 2018-10-16 20:11:35 I actually have a crush on you
1696 2018-10-16 20:11:24 @Nouriel  what the fuck bro. It's been 1 hour and you have not tweeted about how bad crypto is For the world.
1697 2018-10-16 20:11:24 Looks great! I’m missing @ChibiFighters
1698 2018-10-16 20:11:23 compare $CHX and $RVN head to head. a lot of their features overlap and both in a new potentially game changing niche of #security #equity #tokens
1699 2018-10-16 20:11:06 Can I please just have both
1700 2018-10-16 20:11:04 Hey just watched your newest video! Good stuff! I just wanted to let you know, that the US debt issue, isn't going away. The world acknowledged crypto is here to stay, thus eventually, crypto will kill all FIAT. Thus leaders will move quickly to "protect nation interests."
1701 2018-10-16 20:10:42 Can i call you daddy
1702 2018-10-16 20:10:32 I’m not here to make friends loser

1709 2018-10-16 20:09:43 You're a very handsome man.
I lose self control sometimes
1710 2018-10-16 20:09:34 I was CONVINCED Bitcoin is the least transparent crypto? Seriously, not trolling. I don't understand who pay(s) developers and why, i.e. what are the interests behind (I guess the money is not coming from altruists)? 

Can you maybe shed some light on this please? Links are fine.
1711 2018-10-16 20:09:29 Kinky....
1712 2018-10-16 20:09:23 You got him on statistics, but on a macro level he is right that crypto economies are as unequal as traditional economies
The biggest issue is, if we have a financial crisis, and the masses flee the banks towards crypto, it’s going to create a worse economy for most people
1713 2018-10-16 20:09:19 Asians like money. And they like to gamble. Therefore, asians like crypto. well at least this asian does (and pretty much every other one)
1714 2018-10-16 20:09:19 I'm not talking about "my replies" in general, I'm talking about the content of the replies which would, well, depend on the content written at the time ^^
1715 2018-10-16 20:09:19 #bullrun is starting? #crypto
1716 2018-10-16 20:09:00 Bullish?
1717 2018-10-16 20:08:48 Lol :-) I'm with you. Took profit on the top but it just looked soooo tasty when it dipped, I couldn't resist - I just had to.... I..I...
Now blisters appear on my hands from hodling this one through what obviously must be a test, a waiting game for the not faint of heart. 
1718 2018-10-16 20:08:47 *canine. My cats is still OK... Promise.... Unless crypto keeps going down, then I may have to sell him to the takeaway down the road...
1719 2018-10-16 20:08:40 Got some coins stuck on there, confo email not being sent, and no support response after a week of contact. I think it’s a common theme with them, I advise non of my followers to deposit any crypto there for the time been. Looks like they are having a ton of issues .
1720 2018-10-16 20:08:31 I'm still monitoring the charts. Interestingly price is right below the trend line and bearish OB I was looking to short. However, I'm not taking any trades whilst I wait for the tether situation to normalise. $BTC $BTCUSD $XBTUSD #bitcoin #crypto #cryptocurrency

1722 2018-10-16 20:08:25 Or do what the Chinese do when they don’t like something (like Apps on the Internet) just ban them!

1723 2018-10-16 20:08:24 Thanks for the shoutout, sir. See you on DC
1724 2018-10-16 20:08:20 Okay, then go sell your pants and buy some more shitcoins.
1725 2018-10-16 20:08:08 You finally made it crypto rich congrats
1726 2018-10-16 20:07:59 If I don’t have time to help on-board people I point them to Coinbase.  It simplifies the process for a n00b. I do like @AbraGlobal as well, and the Bit10 is great for people wanting to get into crypto before they have time to DYOR about the projects out there

1729 2018-10-16 20:07:45 Its meth laden family that I don’t talk to. They constantly do it to themselves. I came from the same dirt poor beginnings, worked hard, put a priority on learning and made it out.

1732 2018-10-16 20:06:59 The US Government has gone from telling the Media that I'm a "Fish on a Line... Dead to Rights Terrorist... A Criminal Mastermind" to telling them "We will stop him from Suing us".

If you can't tell, that thing where you call me angry and violent, that's you on the Defense.
1733 2018-10-16 20:06:59 Any crypto that isn’t Bitcoin is a “shitcoin”?  Love your book but disagree with that idea.

1737 2018-10-16 20:06:47 If we see another run on crypto. It’s gonna get a huge portion of new money. 
This actually has me hyped... how do I keep falling for it?!
1738 2018-10-16 20:06:45 I disagree, they'll drive the market.
1739 2018-10-16 20:06:40 Yes, specially if you know where to put that stop.

I've seen young kids around Crypto Twitter smuggling stop losses at random just cause it was cool.

Remember kids, call the TA Police if your friends try to shove a random top loss up your ass 
1740 2018-10-16 20:06:40 Have done this mistake on $XHV but the strong fundamentals saved me. I wasn't lucky on other projects. But I consider every loss as a lesson so I'm motivated to learn.

Me: Not at all. Did you know; as soon as you deposit your 'money' in a bank, it's no longer yours. In fact they lend it to others to create more money.

Person: Sounds complicated. I'll keep sleeping.
1747 2018-10-16 20:05:43 Buying into crypto for the first time, is a bit like being an extra in game of thrones.... at first its all exciting, then suddenly you're dead.

1758 2018-10-16 20:04:46 The US government is more deeply involved in crypto than anybody realizes. They have always been on the forefront of technological development and crypto is no exception.

1764 2018-10-16 20:04:11 Haven’t we already determined that nothing is decentralized? But the hardcore Crypto guys still hang onto that myth.
1765 2018-10-16 20:04:03 That last part makes a lot of sense.
1766 2018-10-16 20:03:53 You fucking spam my timeline way too often lately.

1790 2018-10-16 20:01:11 Same here. Looking at the performance of my portfolio and comparing it to the numbers these crypto funds are publishing, you could think that  I'm some kind of genius.  I don't manage millions or billions of assets though.
1791 2018-10-16 20:01:07 People should be given a choice. One of the most respected exchanges are taking their personal views over demand from the crypto community. Its not how a business should be operating. #xrp

1798 2018-10-16 20:00:46 There's a couple other POW projects I got in to on TradeOgre as well. Low caps. Good projects. One is 1 sat, can only go up. The other was 3 sats, now up 3x, took out my original investment, now making free money..

1802 2018-10-16 20:00:26 Do you understand why people became so bullish? IMO they just disregarded the fact that money came from @Tether_to into #BTC #ETH and other big caps. Obviously, they could not cash out billions of USD, but literally, nothing else changed

- Am I ok?
- Is it worth my time?
- If I'm accusing, can I prove it or make sense?

If I can't answer yes to 1, I prob shouldn't reply

1903 2018-10-16 19:48:03 If crypto as a whole (as you state) was a scam and a bubble about to pop and go to 0... Then why would  you care who would control 80% of the market that you think won't be around? 
Because you know you are already losing... Have a great week.

1906 2018-10-16 19:47:34 Fidelity have been mining since 15. You just don't waltz into Crypto, pretty sure these guys know what they are doing
1907 2018-10-16 19:47:32 I agree this is the best time All I was saying in my disappointment was that I was hoping Fidelity would let the average investor have access to using their platform for those who question the legitimacy of crypto and safety of their funds. Make it easy 4 them

1963 2018-10-16 19:40:16 Good project in crypto
1964 2018-10-16 19:40:13 well sure but the best profits will be before the institutions are up and running. possible situation in the future where there could be a bull run up till these "financial instituations" get into crypto and as soon as they get in they short it for another 6-8 months.
1965 2018-10-16 19:40:09 What sense? That it’s all manipulated? And we just have to go with the flow? One rule if you’re not a (good) trader: BUY low, SELL high. Don’t forget to sell, don’t forget to sell, don’t forget to sell, don’t...

2005 2018-10-16 19:34:19 I’m seeing this as a bear flag which is why i am more biased towards a bearish scenario. I’ll keep this scenario in mind.

2058 2018-10-16 19:26:41 furthermore if they cant learn how to copy past a crypto address then they probably shouldn't be investing in crypto. not trying to be mean or rude I just mean they might send it to the wrong address and lose their money.

There is an epidemic of lack of accountability in this world.

2090 2018-10-16 19:22:54 $MAN’s vision is to leverage AI to improve smart contracts and increase BC security. $BTO’s value proposition is exchange of AI data and data mining... Unless either of the two has changed their offering in the past 6 months it is NOT $MAN vs. $BTO.
2091 2018-10-16 19:22:50 aw wtf man no i'm sad about this. 1broker was there holding our hands giving us hope when bitcoin did the sideways for 1 year thing :(

2104 2018-10-16 19:21:26 $MAN has a far wider scope, but $BTO been flying under the radar recently! $20-30m MC?!? These two will be crazy multipliers in a bull market. #AI #OBOR

2113 2018-10-16 19:20:44 when stream sir?
2114 2018-10-16 19:20:39 Tech replacing jobs? We talking AI now? And the whole point of crypto is to take that power back from banks.
2115 2018-10-16 19:20:25 Network effect tells me nobody. Too late so sorry for the competition.
2116 2018-10-16 19:20:21 and there is little to prevent a party from tranascting in crypto while incarcertated.
2117 2018-10-16 19:20:20 I think zil will surprise everyone
2118 2018-10-16 19:20:13 I think xrp is slow. Transactions take 3 seconds and is only on chain scaleable to 50k. Cobalt is of chain and also by ripple. 800 nodes is far from decentralised. Its the nr 1 noob coin for all new people to crypto. 
2119 2018-10-16 19:20:12 HODL, EOS IOTA NEO ICX ONT WAN XRP ZIL and you will be able to achieve both.....
2120 2018-10-16 19:20:05 I think finex and mex will meet as the price drops. finex is going to go even further.
2121 2018-10-16 19:19:58 Talk about short and friendly UX in registration processes? Crypto traders walk the extra mile. Opening up an account in an exchange can consume days, if not a week.

Setting up your wallet also sometimes takes time, not to mention securing your private key.

2124 2018-10-16 19:19:35 Accumulating popular coins that are up +10,000% is equivalent to eating slopping table scraps off a dirty floor.
Most of the money in crypto is made by being an early adopter on big projects.

2142 2018-10-16 19:16:47 achieving its goal. However, in the crypto world, we may have a similar yet more insidious problem. It is trivial to claim that one "Forgot" a password and thus can no longer access assets for months or years later, only to later "remember" that password.
2143 2018-10-16 19:16:34 Good decision on $CNN #cnntoken this is gonna rip when it starts to move

2149 2018-10-16 19:15:47 "Literally nothing" is a good formulation for what one can buy with crypto.
2150 2018-10-16 19:15:33 The point is only verfying that the scaling method works. Of course it will take years to fill it with real use. But if you aren't sure that it scales why bother building the rest? And btw Komodo architecture is very flexible to integrate new tech and scaling solutions
2151 2018-10-16 19:15:33 Lol all I said was that the crypto market has more upside potential. I didn't say this exact day crypto would surpass stocks in growth either.
2152 2018-10-16 19:15:28 CurveSDK is a good opportunity for making user-friendly dApps. Just build it! 
2153 2018-10-16 19:15:16 Just imagine the fud after bitcoin hits $1M...and procedes to lose $900,000 in the bear run following the climb up to $1M.

2156 2018-10-16 19:15:05 A question for Augur @AugurProject, @joeykrug. No space has so many predictions going on like crypto. Sadly there are never consequences for people calling whatever prices. Wouldn´t this be the perfect market to make people stand in for their predictions? I wish it would exist.
2157 2018-10-16 19:14:59 The big firms moving into crypto are just a new batch of noobs.

They don’t know shit. 

There is nothing that can quite prepare you for this. 

You need to be fucked hard and long real good before it all starts to make sense.

2171 2018-10-16 19:12:47 I couldnt care less abotut he motivation behind the finex spike. It pushed the whole crypto market up and broke the downtrend momentum. 
In a week, no casual will remember or hear about it. They will only see the chart. And the chart says bull time.
2172 2018-10-16 19:12:27 I’m gradually learning crypto and am starting to get my head properly around trading. It pains me to think that my trades are based on mainly TA and less so on fundamentals, can any experts advise if I need to change tact? I always use a stop loss just in case. #crypto

2175 2018-10-16 19:11:47 That's why LT cap gains tax for crypto should be way less than a year, because crypto markets are open 24-7 while traditional markets open weekdays for a set time.
2176 2018-10-16 19:11:36 Last RT I haven’t listened yet but I did skim through the write up and I’m not surprised he advised against investing in fads like penny stock, crypto, marijuana industry
2177 2018-10-16 19:11:35 I’m 10000% positive I could run these crypto funds better than 99% of the people doing it

2178 2018-10-16 19:11:30 I believe it honestly, the crypto world is smaller than it appears. They all have worked together, lived/loved together, partied together etc you get my drift. Too bad they can’t roll one up and talk about bros before hoes, and make jokes about the skank.
2179 2018-10-16 19:11:28 I like the idea of WireGuard (new Linux kernel VPN module) but I'm less sanguine about the cipher suite selected. Anyone know how well the selected crypto and hashes have been vetted?

2213 2018-10-16 19:06:08 It will be ok, they will appear there. They just take a while to get swapped. Join the telegram group if you have questions, the admins are nice.
2214 2018-10-16 19:06:01 The fact that people can’t see through @MichaelSuppo’s bullshit is astonishing.  I don’t care if someone admits it’s a paid review or sponsorship.  But he’s not in the US so he doesn’t have to state that up front legally.  And he tries to sell crypto courses to suckers lol

2262 2018-10-16 18:59:16 Morgan Stanley, Citibank, Goldman Sachs, NYSE all have publicized that they are working on crypto services and products, Fidelity is late to the announcement party tbh. Though I agree not many people are likely interested. Yet.

2279 2018-10-16 18:57:03 also, the payment processing companies can use crypto code for the backend if  they see a use case for it. 

So lets say if VISA or Mastercard see that a company has faster TPS, they will integrate it...and use the solution...don't you think? :)

2291 2018-10-16 18:55:51 I agree they do all to suit them. Similarly to how the IRS, SEC, etc all label crypto something different to suit their greedy needs.
2292 2018-10-16 18:55:47 As far as I've been told institutional investors want nothing to do with crypto. The reason why no one was really trying to beat Fidelity to the punch is because the clientele is small. Financial advisers are rarely ever asked about investing into crypto.

2296 2018-10-16 18:55:21 I hope so! I even watched 2 YouTube vids and followed step by step. Seemed so easy at first too 
2297 2018-10-16 18:55:20 As we’ve (hopefully) learned within the crypto space, it matters not whether money flows from points of high concentration to low, or low to high, if effective allocation and accountability mechanisms are not put in place to pair funding with trustworthy execution.

2347 2018-10-16 18:49:23 Who knows? Maybe people panicking into $BTC was just the push price needed to pull us outta this downtrend. At least it's fun to think about...
2348 2018-10-16 18:49:12 Oh i know it was not JUST this, it was all the ignorance on twitter believing all the FUD. Most people dont use common sense but use emotion. Thats what separates the real traders with those that think they know how to trade and just lose money. FUD will never end brother!
2349 2018-10-16 18:49:03 It's all about lobbyists swaying the vote of our representatives. Where there's money, there's a politician being paid off legally! The question is, is there more money in legalization? Hate to be so cynical, but the only thing these representatives seem to listen to anymore is $
2350 2018-10-16 18:49:02 I wonder several reasons:
1-he wants notorious rise
(Better they talk bad of me rather they dont talk at all)
2-His daughter have a crypto boyfriend richer than him
3-His wife invested the couple money in crypto
4-in reality he wants to buy btc, talk bad to get it cheaper price
2351 2018-10-16 18:48:53 Nope.. and I'm not currently in any.. too early for them IMHO. It's all about alt HODLing for me and if I did sell I would hold in BTC or buy the dips on another solid alt.

2405 2018-10-16 18:43:21 You’re not wrong it can make it hard for maybe a non crypto person that wants to attend and learn.

2420 2018-10-16 18:41:34 I've skimmed through the whole, 215-pages report; Bitcoin and crypto are mentioned in *one single sentence* (the whole article is based on it).

2439 2018-10-16 18:39:49 That's great and all, but why make a $100 order? Doesn't seem like a risk, but more so a waste of time to do any TA on it unless your looking at a larger entry. Putting this tweet and chart together costed you more than $100. Time is money

2457 2018-10-16 18:37:37 No doubt, we've had a bunch of bullish news for the market over the last 2 months. What I want to know is with all these institutional exchanges coming into the space, how many of them will actually buy BTC at that time and how many of them already bought theirs through OTC?
2458 2018-10-16 18:37:31 thanks man. trying to learn so that's why i ask such questions, not trying to be some douchbag
2459 2018-10-16 18:37:30 I also suspect that BTC whales and bitcoincore supporters have been so complicit to look the other way in this scheme, because they understand that BTC must increase in fiat terms (to attract new buyers) if they are to be "rich" in the future crypto-economy.

2497 2018-10-16 18:31:53 It's unethical for government workers to serve private interests.

It should be unethical for people in crypto to serve government interests.

Because resisting government to carve out a digitial space for unrestrained human expression & experimentation is the entire point.

"Fact: Crypto is the future. 
It’s not a matter of “If” crypto will take down the entire financial world, it’s just a question of “when.” 

You can either get left behind or prepare to become MEGA wealthy."
2514 2018-10-16 18:29:49 But it’s kinda seems more realistic than all the other projects in a way they have a tron disney movie, tron roller coaster, the gaming industry, crypto pets I’m mean it does seem far fetched. Now a castle?...I don’t know would be great tho

2-dont wait until you lose all your wallet then do number one.
3-Risk management.
4-dont use food money to trade.

2579 2018-10-16 18:20:06 Ticket prices become unaffordable -  the secondary (and at times, the primary market) can charge exceptionally high transactional costs, when, it can be extremely cost efficient to facilitate these forms of transactions #bitcoin #crypto #BLOCKCHAIN
2580 2018-10-16 18:20:05 So you only pay tax on any appreciative value you receive when entering back into the FIAT market. Because until you take profits, you haven't made profits. Thus, you're only responsible for taxes on what you earn in a FED acknowledged currency, ie not any crypto as of yet.

2586 2018-10-16 18:19:24 Coinbase seems to be losing the institutional battle for crypto and it has aleardy lost the battle for crypto banking by failing to list $XRP as xRapid will go through another exchange. A month in crypto is a year in the real world.

2602 2018-10-16 18:16:31 Nah, Gringo's "source" is from 2014, before the US government really had a clue what crypto was. The CFTC labelled all cryptos as commodities two weeks ago. So trading crypto now will have similar tax structures to trading gold for silver.
2603 2018-10-16 18:16:22 It’s not s coincidence, the backers for  Tron are all in connection to big Corp. the talent on Tron comes from huge corporations.  could be that Chinese government and all the involved parties are pushing it to simply dominate new are of internet.....

2615 2018-10-16 18:14:27 Investor sends USD to Tether, gets stake in exchange.... gets BTC profits or other crypto sent back to them from the exchange. Then that "investor" cashes into fiat out at coinbase for example.  Then reinvests that fiat back into Tether.  Wash and rinse???

I'm speculating.

2627 2018-10-16 18:12:53 1/ I don't know about this. There are so many pitfalls with shorting that could ruin you even if your thesis is right. First, you have to get the timing right. Second you have to find a platform you can trust. Dodgy crypto exchanges don't count.
2628 2018-10-16 18:12:50 Hell Yeah !

2637 2018-10-16 18:12:24 First, your source is from 2014..(outdated)

Second, how is a government going to peg a crypto trade to someone not using FIAT?

Because obviously any intelligent crypto trader uses VPNs, and filter their funds through privacy coins/unmarked accounts before trading.

2642 2018-10-16 18:11:35 When you sell a crypto asset into a stable coin it’s a non-taxable event unlike when you sell it into Fiat which is a taxable event plus if the stable coin is Pegged to the dollar you can jump in and out of all volatility and make profit
2643 2018-10-16 18:11:30 Yeah Bruno sucked. Agreed.
2644 2018-10-16 18:11:28 Awsome project!!!
2645 2018-10-16 18:11:21 It would explain why when new Tether is issued, it is specifically sent to certain USDT exchanges. And then those exchanges compensate those dark market investors in crypto, and then those investors cash out at real fiat exchanges.

2654 2018-10-16 18:10:33 We're both in crypto and so get how unsound and unhealthy fractional banking is for the economy in th elong run. Bitfinex randomly printing of usdt and inflating the market is a million times worse, surely you see that. If it comes down to trusting butfinex, that's just laughable
2655 2018-10-16 18:10:29 I'd rather there not be regulator's fisting are crypto it would be no different than a multinational 'bank'
2656 2018-10-16 18:10:19 For him to pull off that outrageous facade is brilliant. It was so blatantly offensive, that it was brilliant. Hard to think of many actors who can execute as well as this.

2663 2018-10-16 18:09:35 I’ll attempt to loudly understand this from a layperson’s perspective: Crypto space would literally cease to exist if Bitcoin is somehow “switched off”. And you would literally need to switch off internet to achieve this, right?
2664 2018-10-16 18:09:34 US gov will be very close to KSA more then before and they will brainwashed us population as usually in us media.
2665 2018-10-16 18:09:23 Crypto companies providing services for other crypto companies have a captive and neverending market (like $ZRX). It's projects like these that'll make it.
2666 2018-10-16 18:09:18 Since it's apparent that Crypto will empower a whole new generation of people with wealth and influence in the world. I'd like to propose that we, the new power brokers of the world, form a coalition against Racism and bigotry.  Racism, has the potential to destroy all of us.

2678 2018-10-16 18:07:09 He doesn't know yet that crypto is indeed international. Or maybe he thinks native Asians and Africans are white supremacists as well.
2679 2018-10-16 18:06:53 in 2017 my main cryptocurrency was #Ethereum $ETH because of cheaper fees & faster transaction confirmations. this year 2018, my main crypto is $EOS because of feeless & ultra-fast transaction confirmations (~30-40 secs). user experience beats ad nauseam dramas  #JustBUIDL

2684 2018-10-16 18:06:03 absolutely nothing
2685 2018-10-16 18:05:56 @AstroCrytpoGuru is referring to Bitcoin specifically, and what happens to Bitcoin has a large knock on effect to the rest of the crypto market. Sometimes with Saturn transits, it can spread over to Tether, etc
2686 2018-10-16 18:05:35 I think anyone who's seen one pro/against crypto 'debate' has seen them all. Its more like senseless shouting with the crowd cheering. No need for another one. Might be good for ratings, but completely useless otherwise

2692 2018-10-16 18:04:50 Calling Walton as a scam is baseless and furthers my point on the hypocrisy seen in Vechain followers... Waltonchains team literally has spoken at the great hall of people in China- not something a scam could get away with. It’s probably the most legit appearance in crypto.

2705 2018-10-16 18:02:44 That’s the thing, I’m disappointed in the project I support- I don’t know what their excuse is and I’d like to know- I’m not blindly following them and I can recognize their shortcomings. Again- why are you deflecting the topic to Walton?

2717 2018-10-16 18:01:49 Still have yet to see downside of a #Bitcoin backed crypto fiat called stablecoins as long as there is 100% transparency & auditability. The main issue being the flooding of new fiat out of thin air backed by nothing without public consent which rewards gamblers & crushes savers
2718 2018-10-16 18:01:44 Great. Looks like a very nice venue. It's good to see the crypto space growing at the rate that it is here in CO. Denver is going to be one of the greatest hubs of innovation in the US and possibly even the world.
2719 2018-10-16 18:01:36 Everything is to a degree is value by it's relative juxtaposition to another. In regard to crypto, the case is no different. Why do shitcoin have value? Because they are value against BTC which is then valued in USD

2752 2018-10-16 17:58:48 You have the best crypto trading platform, with the best trading capabilities for retail traders -yet you fail on the most fundamental & basic step for building trust: proper & decent communication with your customers. Nothing but *miserable*, Mr. Van der Velde!
2753 2018-10-16 17:58:42 Doubtful... Point of his post is that he agrees that "Crypto Twitter" is smarter than Wall Street? Or the other way around and he is even bullish on Bitcoin now because "Crypto Twitter" is so stupid?
2754 2018-10-16 17:58:35 Anyway that doesnt have to be this case, but i prefer samsung for their design and overal user experience, but also these new models do really make you feel that they pimped out every aspect of the phone after that 10 generation development.
I hope you know what im sayin :D

2759 2018-10-16 17:58:24 I'm the one that defined stage two in my blog post (second tweet).  Give that a read so we're on the same page
2760 2018-10-16 17:58:22 I am bullish on both. Walton seems legit as well...however insane lack of marketing

Im not saying that this is the case, but it can be that they can be slower or problematic after some period of using them. For example the older galaxy models were really shitty after a year or two.

2773 2018-10-16 17:56:26 If you've been in since 4-5k sats and haven't sold any yet (at 5-6x) , you deserve to watch your gains dissolve.  If you're reluctant to get in after a coin does a 5-6x in 3 weeks, then you may be one of the few in crypto that has some sense.

2784 2018-10-16 17:55:10 2. However that cannot be said about Huawei for example, because they are  a young manufacturer. My point here is, they can be great phones overall but  because of less experience of the company they can often have some issues after longer period of owning one.

2789 2018-10-16 17:54:59 Well, while we wait for this fictional scenario I’ll keep holding my crypto. Not healthy to live in fear of what “may” happen.
2790 2018-10-16 17:54:56 Tbh you don't even need blockchain. Simply making internet/mobile banking easier, and national and international transfers faster and cheaper, has already made the crypto sell more difficult. I still think fin. institutions are too reactive to get ahead. I guess we'll see though.

2793 2018-10-16 17:54:17 You fail to see whats happening under your nose with Walton Scam and point fingers towards others. Do I really need to remind you you are holding a coin without a mainnet and dubious price winning activities? Wake up already.

2796 2018-10-16 17:53:58 If crypto currency is a fraud as you have stated , what difference does it make if China becomes the biggest producer or miner of Bitcoins which will be worth nothing one day ? Mining Crypto currency  is to use the concept of mining incorrectly . Nothing is really mined .
2797 2018-10-16 17:53:53 @Nouriel
2798 2018-10-16 17:53:43 It’s a huge issue for bitcoin.  60% + of bitcoin mining is Chinese. Hash rate not centralized.
2799 2018-10-16 17:53:32 he is the villain we need, hopefully. last run it was roger. his shenanigans r boring now and everyones used to it. but this nouriel guy can rile the crypto crowd up pretty well.. and only by regurgitating bear market lemming quotes from 2014. bravo ! hopefully krugman joins in!

It looks nice indeed. However there is one thing about theese ''new'' manufacturers that folks often dont realise.
Samsung phones were not so great in the past but the new models are reflection of almost 10 generations of develompment.
2805 2018-10-16 17:53:08 Exactly.
2806 2018-10-16 17:53:08 You should do a comparison experiment... same crypto, 1 play based on TA the other based on ROLLING THE CHICKEN BONES BOI!! Hahaha. Twitter will love it. Chicken Bone Crypto... all... day.... long.... ;)
2807 2018-10-16 17:53:06 What matters is no one can change Bitcoin's supply of 21 million.I agree lots of people gets into Bitcoin for financial gains,but Bitcoin also acts as hedge against inflation.
All other crypto are effective scams or just centralised blockchain fooling investors as decentralised.

2822 2018-10-16 17:51:32 One @BillyBambrough article in a financial publication that has a history of slandering BTC doesn't strike me as "stage 2" worthy, but if it becomes a pattern that would be a big confirmation. Billy has wrote a few articles with clickbaity titles with little-to-no foundation.

Because they are.
2829 2018-10-16 17:50:38 The United States can compete. They have abundant energy and talent. The US administration’s answer should be a crypto moon-shot.
2830 2018-10-16 17:50:24 The ability to interchange assets, and the depth that crypto payment processors have gone sadly makes it impossible for me to just spit out a list. We cater to merchants, not to platforms and it has always been that way, in the same it also makes it slightly harder to track.
2831 2018-10-16 17:50:21 What do I know, but here’s my high level way to view the market: Wall Street Futures launch at BTC ATH (after run-up) & then, Wall Street launches their own Crypto products at the bottom. What will the pricing do from there?

2840 2018-10-16 17:49:11 Quite a lot of $ALTS are at their local resistances, trying to press to the upside.

2860 2018-10-16 17:46:46 It's dumb to short crypto markets. They're rigged against you. Never play in a rigged casino. The Tether FUD didn't stop prices from jumping to 20,000 and then crashing to 6,000. Why did they suddenly become so stable? Manipulation.

2864 2018-10-16 17:46:33 Can the same be said about crypto as well?
2865 2018-10-16 17:46:30 It was last major support before ATH and historical support /resistance tends to hold strong. And below 6k is a dark pit of who knows wtf so people are scared to sell and go that low. Also people are afraid that it will moon the second they sell at 6k. I think so anyway.
2866 2018-10-16 17:46:30 It’s an enhanced version.

2872 2018-10-16 17:45:28 I take it you’re expecting 6K to hold then. If you ask Me Angelo’s tweet doesn’t necessarily mean the last dip is over... maybe a semi veiled way of saying the last dip is about to happen...? But yeah more likely he meant 6K was bottom and time to reverse

2898 2018-10-16 17:42:51 Sorry to hear that. Perhaps u copied the wrong ones. I also often checked their trades and if I didn't agree with one I'd close it manually. I had a 3x+ there
2899 2018-10-16 17:42:50 It means you hold 5,000,000,000 coins. Add 'em up, carry the 1, divide, you total crypto net worth is $0.45. Would you like cash or check?
2900 2018-10-16 17:42:50 True supporters need no money...  Every crypto event should be open to public. Not just another paid group.

2903 2018-10-16 17:42:33 There is a contradiction stated here.  A national crypto used by 'force' and  a need to use bitcoin? So it is being cashed out ie turned into state denominated money?
2904 2018-10-16 17:42:25 nice

2916 2018-10-16 17:40:56 Even if you’re “short” in an intellectual sense, financially shorting an asset may not be the best way of materializing your interest. 

Buffet for example said he’d never short crypto but would do a five year put on every crypto.

Okay, not discounting appropriation of a concept for crypto-fascist cultspeak and shibboleth. But have you met people? You know social pressure to express care for a thing can differ from one’s caring for a thing, yeah?

2934 2018-10-16 17:39:25 As @MagicalTux taught us many years ago, one exchange going boom does not kill crypto.

The lesson here is to hold your own keys. And DYOR on "USD backed" OMNI assets.

By design, Bitcoin is unregulated. No safety nets. No take backs. 

Feature, not bug.

2942 2018-10-16 17:38:42 Cashed out? to a national crypto the everyone is forced to use? I think you underestimate the potential of p2p cash (which does scale as a stack). Maybe you never actually need to use it, but I do and our views are orthogonal. Mine aligns with the original purpose of Bitcoin.

2984 2018-10-16 17:34:54 In part Tax/DAF: namely financial houses have the wherewithal to flirt with complex/risky financial assets; financial houses largely control DAFS; and we treat DAFs as public charities. Contribution of crypto to DAFs as public charity gives biggest tax benefit.

2986 2018-10-16 17:34:41 He doesn't even see that he's undermining his own points. He wants to attack Twitter users, showing he's acting on emotion, so bad that he basically says, "The smart people think crypto has bottomed and will now go up."
2987 2018-10-16 17:34:26 Yes correct, they will create their own coins. Insoders buy seed round then dump on retailers.
2988 2018-10-16 17:34:19 Lol, you just buy all the hype and buzzwords. You have the mentality of a crypto noob with no skepticism towards scammers.
2989 2018-10-16 17:34:12 The thing is, e-cash (probably based on crypto) *is* inevitable. Increasingly complex e-commerce, consumption of digital products, IOT etc will require it. The question is whether states maintain control during the transition. The best chance ideologues have is to build it first.
2990 2018-10-16 17:34:12 @coinbase is like the johnny manziel of crypto. Looked great early on, but never changed. People have started to move on to better things offering more. Binance, robinhood etc  The list goes on.

2995 2018-10-16 17:33:54 Sorry but this is hard to believe: “Altcoins are insurance against state-level attacks on Bitcoin.” If the State can successfully attack Bitcoin, which is the most secure crypto we have, then it will also be able to attack any other cryptocurrency.

3005 2018-10-16 17:32:51 Who care about goldman sachs?!With the news like this we are harming crypto space. They just want profit for them self, no intention to build something good. When they started to publishtheir intentions and when the futures arrived price of bitcoin fell down. Who needs them?
3006 2018-10-16 17:32:44 This seems to have been the case with Silkroad establishing the Bitcoin price. Payment processors are actually fast, and cheaper than credit cards. So I don't think that's a problem. Admittedly obtaining crypto is more difficult. Motivation for crypto adoption *is* key, though.

3016 2018-10-16 17:31:17 Here's the thing, stable supply isn't stable. Take even the hardest of money supply caps like we see in crypto. Credit which can be spent the same way as money still exists. Harder to borrow in a regime where your money grows in value just sitting but credit adds to money supply.

3023 2018-10-16 17:30:20 Regarding Bakkt+Fidelity and the other 100’s of trading platforms for the average Joe, that will come out of the woodwork in the coming months/years- it would take us  1or2 hours to train someone who knew nothing about crypto, how to buy, then store safely etc their holdings 1/2
3024 2018-10-16 17:29:51 Some thoughts. I think value/price of crypto is determined like this: Is there a desirable and unique usecase? Are tokens scarce? If the usecase is conditional on holding tokens, supply and demand yields price. Volatility results from speculation on future price, not bottlenecks.
3025 2018-10-16 17:29:45 I think it needs to be buffalo chicken wings for crypto_bobby from the photos I see
3026 2018-10-16 17:29:38 Can it be done in scale?  My point is #crypto has been touted as an end of days solution to fiat destruction.  Truth is if we do reach that point, very few people will have access to their wallets.   Will that then create a dystopian society?   My guess is yes.

3028 2018-10-16 17:28:44 I think it’s major bullshit how a US govt agency can cross borders and shut shit down. It’s disgusting.
3029 2018-10-16 17:28:41 Spreading correct info as you know is more important. You are one of the front fighters with the whole swift&ripple partnership not being real. But in this case you seem to have a more flexible position on not confirmed claims..

3032 2018-10-16 17:28:13 Crypto utilization could be the solution for countries with failing fiat currencies and could help those countries circumvent inflation. Poor countries can’t afford to print money, it’s expensive. #Crypto #currencies #inflation

3090 2018-10-16 17:22:04 well nothing in crypto is stable enough to fit that need (we first used shitcoin/BTC pairs but that is far from enough)-- so right now we have to trust 3rd parties and clearly there is demand for them because those USDT pairs have been getting more liquidity
3091 2018-10-16 17:21:57 Geruchten rond tether zijn er al maanden, waar rook is......

3093 2018-10-16 17:21:45 Yes Ripple is not as decentralized as the usual crypto enthusiast would prefer.  The thing is if we expect global adoption we need a Crypto that works with Government and banks that can be regulated at a level.  Ripple offers that and great transaction times.

3100 2018-10-16 17:21:15 I think it's more to do with regulatory compliance than just "traditional finance". Stripe taking precautions perhaps. In India for example, @RBI has stopped banks/payment services from accepting Fiat for any crypto related business.
3101 2018-10-16 17:20:57 First of all it's #CT and second of all no one in the space takes @CNBC seriously. Research easily shows how they are wrong more times than a broken clock. Always good to research your sources.

3172 2018-10-16 17:12:31 Well, I don't even have an account on @bitfinex.

You know why?

Because I can buy/sell $BTC from my local #Exchange @Bitso, I send $MXN from my bank account, and in secs the money is ready to buy #Crypto.

And the same goes for withdrawals.

Poor bastards using finex...

3175 2018-10-16 17:12:14 I agree. I don't think Jan 2019 will be instant bull run. As a matter of fact, I think a lot of people are going to be cashing out for crypto taxes, then hopefully we'll see some progress around the start of Q2 2019.

3177 2018-10-16 17:12:09 Btw, I’m not saying #DeFi is part of #ETHCommons. 

I’m just saying #DeFi is an example of a crypto community-based hashtag, and #ETHCommons is another example.

(Btw, you might want to apply this kind of thinking to FEM. e.g. Should there be a shared hashtag?)

3200 2018-10-16 17:09:30 I don't follow the case for why crypto collapses.  What is the path from Bitfinex collapsing to crypto collapsing?  You would have thought with Tether losing its peg that we would have seen signs of this bearing out.

3204 2018-10-16 17:09:09 Yep, you are correct here. Ripple's XRP coin is completely centralised in every way. Nothing new for people who follow crypto/blockchain developments.

3224 2018-10-16 17:06:26 2) Crypto has crashed by 70% because it *is* a speculative asset. Until it is widely used as a means of exchange and circulates as such, its value is determined only by speculation on its possible future use as currency.

3274 2018-10-16 17:00:59 I agree with this, and would argue much of the DeFi industry does as well.  That is why the majority of the newer projects like @dydxprotocol and @DharmaProtocol raised capital through SAFE's not token sales.

3430 2018-10-16 16:42:21 Indeed..
3431 2018-10-16 16:42:13 I assume by #crypto you mean #blockchain.  If so, #cryptocurrency was the first implementation and PoC for blockchain, but there are so many exciting projects out there that use this technology.  It's not about dominance, but how we solve real-world problems in innovative ways.
3432 2018-10-16 16:42:12 Your crypto-sense is tingling!

3450 2018-10-16 16:38:41 細かい額のビットコインを大量に受け取っていると（例えば，1時間ごとに自動受信する形のハイプで）「過去に受信した多くの小規模な決済を統合する必要」のために，送金手数料があとで多額になる可能性があるような気がします。

3462 2018-10-16 16:37:48 It may not be an audit but they did say independent audits will be provided and I have no doubt to the validity of their statements unlike Bitfinex Teather & Co. who I empirically do not trust! I believe most of the crypto community could get behind trusting Winkvoss vs BT&C.
3463 2018-10-16 16:37:46 The bottom line is, $BCO staking already pays out twice monthly in $BTC and $BCO. Holding an #altcoin that pays passive income in #Bitcoin is a rare extremely low-risk high-reward opportunity, if you're a long term $crypto bull.
3464 2018-10-16 16:37:46 thank you

3468 2018-10-16 16:37:32 Yes
3469 2018-10-16 16:37:32 $BNT has no fundamental value. This is obvious. Your product has no users. This is also obvious. Literally no one in crypto is talking using it or even talking about it.
3470 2018-10-16 16:37:27 Yes.
3471 2018-10-16 16:37:25 Now this giveaway I really LIKE! Love Delta  and you too Wendy 
3472 2018-10-16 16:37:21 ok now i want to join the party also, @Nouriel pls block me!!
3473 2018-10-16 16:37:06 this looks exactly like $NEO btw, having monitored the said chart for the last few days.
3474 2018-10-16 16:36:59 The project has a great idea, the fees are going well. If the project is successfully implemented, we will see a cool and successful product that will find its large audience. #muzika #MZK #muzikanetwork #muzikaico #blockchain #ico #ethereum #crypto

3494 2018-10-16 16:34:27 crypto market volume was over $20 Billion yesterday and now is around $12 Billion. that’s quite the drop. I’m skeptical some of these volume numbers reported by exchanges are accurate rather than estimations.
3495 2018-10-16 16:34:24 Those are bitcoin addresses
3496 2018-10-16 16:34:17 Doesn't mean anything to me. Crypto was hot too and thousands of people got wiped out. Check the disclaimers on how long the promo lasts and you'll see exactly when $icnaf will tank again sub 0.50. Stock down today and I'm staying short.

Not true they are only slower due to burocracy. Which make them look like wise . Myth busted

3518 2018-10-16 16:30:58 This is why trying to get the in the face interview or official comment can effect the validity of a article.  For example we contacted official sources but no comment, but our sources tell us.  In any effect I like positivity in crypto so I like it

3521 2018-10-16 16:30:31 In fact he is actually filling a void. His aim is to personify the counter-crypto authority. This is why is addressing (attacking and  bullying)  the crypto personified authorities like @VitalikButerin. The basic rule of show-society is: if you want audience create conflict.

3540 2018-10-16 16:27:43 Level-headed, that may be about the guys like Vin Armani & Rick Falkvinge. Vin has lengthy shows not necessarily about crypto though.
But really, Cryptoverse is the most balanced of them, and it has everything. Not quite into the "hysterical" territory, no.
3541 2018-10-16 16:27:42 I pay to Asha-Lata handicap centre, Sec-5, Bokaro Steel City from my International money receipt - 800, Amount - 100,000 crypto currency. Permission from Jesus Christ? Regards
3542 2018-10-16 16:27:29 Yea but if they came out and said who their “sources” were then they’d be giving them up lol. They don’t wanna do that 
3543 2018-10-16 16:27:28 The challenge here is the unbanked crowd is by large technically unsophisticated making widespread adoption very challenging. Until crypto disappears into the backend technology adoption will be painfully slow. Brave, Opera, DocuSign etc will help speed this up.
3544 2018-10-16 16:27:26 I heard this a few times now from different people, even first hand and not only regarding crypto.

The narrative is always: the government just wants to protect its people.

3554 2018-10-16 16:25:38 The only issue is my favorite exchange, @hitbtc charges $100 withdrawal fees on USDT... Otherwise, I would totally be on board because I only trade on @hitbtc on account of their excellent reliability and response time on customer queries and tickets. @hitbtc > @binance
3555 2018-10-16 16:25:38 Yep, I have said that before -- stablecoins are the crypto version of the free banking era
3556 2018-10-16 16:25:34 I Agee to some extent I like the positive... but just claiming our sources can a bit easy when constructing a narrative.  It would be nice to see names and interviews.
3557 2018-10-16 16:25:21 Cmon you baby whales, follow me!
3558 2018-10-16 16:25:03 the more robust #crypto gets the more competitive it becomes, you can't just stare at charts all the time. informing yourself is so important there is so much shit going on right now that confuses the fuck out of everyone
3559 2018-10-16 16:24:50 “Making a game by itself is hard. Making a good game is that much harder and then you want to put blockchain in it and people write you off”. I love this idea of great game first, blockchain last. UX like this will be a great crypto on-ramp.

Once crypto is more widely adopted, it will be incredibly exciting to be one of the earlier adopters.

3610 2018-10-16 16:18:06 In the sense that there are many other stable coins emerging that could soon dethrone Tether.
3611 2018-10-16 16:18:01 Hello everyone, I am excited for this ICO ! I know that this will be successful with good community and great team that is gonna be big at on crypto. @AirSave_Travel
3612 2018-10-16 16:17:57 i think you mentioned this before. is this possible? it seems like it would be. i'm curious because this would be a great idea for these exchanges that already own a sh!tload of btc or any other crypto for that matter. and, why don't more exchanges have XRP as a base currency?
3613 2018-10-16 16:17:57 As a rule, if you don't "own" the private keys, you don't own the crypto.  With paper and HW wallets, you own the keys.  Crypto on an exchange may be yours by contract, but not in your possession in fact. 2/2

3615 2018-10-16 16:17:43 Yeah, you can juggle all that crypto-nonsense in your head but social context is a fucking mystery ;)

3619 2018-10-16 16:17:13 Well the world is corrupted my friend. Our future is actually going to look like those films we’ve seen where people live on slumps but still get by because of technology . We should do it ourselves. We should be ones spreading crypto education.
3620 2018-10-16 16:16:54 This is a pretty cool idea for the tokens. I am looking forward to getting those other airdrops while hodling(:
3621 2018-10-16 16:16:46 I think this crypto project will be listed in coinmarketcap right after its ICO. We will see!  #LipChain #ICO #Crowdsale #Bitcoinwill

3625 2018-10-16 16:16:04 これはETCか。イーサリアムがハードフォークした結果生まれた通貨だ。theDAOの事件があった後、イーサリアムが「事件が起きなかった時のチェーンまで巻き戻します」と実質的なロールバックを行って、それに怒った採掘者たちが反発して今日まで動いている。まぁ思想の違うイーサリアムだな。

3627 2018-10-16 16:15:48 Philosophically, is this really a problem with the tax/DAF infrastructure? Rather it seems to be a byproduct of the generally absurd crypto fad.

3630 2018-10-16 16:15:16 Probably in a couple months. We are actually developing a solution for this. What if you could earn crypto currency with you pictures?
3631 2018-10-16 16:15:15 Looks like my crypto portfolio performance in 2018....
3632 2018-10-16 16:15:00 Yeah education is a start. Just saying how it is currently. But the government doesn't seem all that interested in improving the situation. Crimes are taken lightly, human rights are always defending thieves and murderers and screwing the good ppl that defend themselves, etc
3633 2018-10-16 16:14:49 I cannot, that is too abstract for me, as my bank offers free transfers for all transactions I need. But transfering like 1000 euros to friend outside of european union with under 1e in fees and under 2 hours (if we count transfering to fiat) well, that is real magic of crypto.
3634 2018-10-16 16:14:46 I agree $POA looks an awesome long term hold. Low supply & demand growing I mean look at the volume spike today most of that was upward pressure Some will sell out and short but it's basically a better ETH with a cross chain that is going to add so much value project & price wise

3640 2018-10-16 16:13:56 it takes time in crypto before you learn the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic motivations of people as you slowly uncover the incentives behind peoples statements and decissions. I am certain that you will be able to free your mind eventually as you get more experienced

3642 2018-10-16 16:13:51 Wow, just because he is listed as CTO does not mean he didn't do the code.   I know in most corporate places that is the way it works, but that's not the case here.  they were wrong. The great thing about #decred guys is that they don't care for the hype.

(each is for better or worse)
3694 2018-10-16 16:09:00 How do you know that we reached the bottoms? 

When you see that @CoinMarketCap is promoting themselves and the other ad is about a non-Tech crypto conference 
3695 2018-10-16 16:08:54 I don’t understand how @ChicoCrypto accusing @CREAMethod of spreading FUD is so wrong when at worst he is doing the same thing CREAM is.

3728 2018-10-16 16:04:46 Ironically blockchain technology might just win the war for big corps, fortify the capital holdings of the top 10%, and make it impossible to circumvent DRM schemes. Playing into the hands of big money and siren servers. Is this what the crypto-libertarians wanted?

3772 2018-10-16 15:59:56 I think this misses billions of unbanked. If you have bad credit or otherwise can't open an account, crypto is basically more accessible checking account. Maybe slow institutional adoption, but even new api system is still prone to leapfrog if censorable + globalization continues

Crypto Coins – Create a new coin which is different to Bitcoin and has its own unique feature and blockchain.
Crypto Tokens – Create a new project, for which to work a special currency is needed.

3836 2018-10-16 15:50:57 The reason the market doesn't value LINK properly is because it's mostly dumb money made up of scalpers playing hot potato shitcoins, moving from one to the next with no fundamental analysis. As marketing picks up, development continues, and shitcoins go to zero, LINK will shine.
3837 2018-10-16 15:50:54 But I don't buy the entire 'out of air part'. I'd rather say BTC is created by the rearranging of electrons, which in a specific arrangement yield a BTC which has value. You could compare it to rearranging neutrons, protons and electrons, which in a specific arrangement form gold
3838 2018-10-16 15:50:36 ICOJournal and this sister site that they have need to be taken with a grain of salt. Nothing they put out is ever confirmed it’s all speculation and they always claim to have “inside sources” be wary of pushing these articles

These balances require constant adjustment & consistent attention. They’re not a “set it and forget it” kinda’ thing.
3853 2018-10-16 15:49:00 You could say BTC is 'being printed out of thin air' but only if you follow it by 'and it's distributed to entities that secure the system by putting in energy (thus money which is then destroyed)'. But in the case of XRP it's distributed to anyone who wants to pay Ripple for it.

3890 2018-10-16 15:43:41 I'm pretty sure there will be no one winner here. I expect dozens of stablecoins coming out next year. It's a perfect playground for old financial institutions to join the crypto game, low risk, high impact.
3891 2018-10-16 15:43:40 The ultimate goal is to not have a need to rely on USD, stable coins or anything with a central authority.  If everyone pays for everything in crypto or Bitcoin then there is no need. Fiat functions the same as crypto when it comes to payments, just centralized. #Goals
3892 2018-10-16 15:43:35 waiting for the ico :)
3893 2018-10-16 15:43:26 Thanks. With the high leverage you can get in Fx and ability to short, would you say you can get as much volatility/returns as you can with BTC/altcoins (factoring in the speed of crypto vs Fx, etc)?

Fx is my bread and butter

95%+ of crypto can only be traded in one direction. Alt investments - a piece of pie with patience 

The right TA works almost like clockwork on fx. On BTC for example it behaves like 90% the same - need to be more fluid imo

3978 2018-10-16 15:35:06 @Btc4buy Lo scopo di questo progetto è quello di collegare il crypto mercato  al settore bancario alla fine di ridurre la speculazione e il furto di crypto valute, che costituiranno il principale quadro per la regolamentazione del mercato e del settore bancario globale.

4033 2018-10-16 15:29:06 The only body that decides on these matter is the FED, so the only good news for an XRP hodler is that the FED is replacing the SDR with XRP.

4050 2018-10-16 15:27:40 DYOR is not just a meme.  Anything in crypto should be questioned and investigated before you invest your time, money, etc. into it.  There are plenty of free resources out there to educate yourself. People need to learn learn themselves instead of relying on others to teach them
4051 2018-10-16 15:27:39 Chainlink is perfectly positioned to solve the biggest problem in crypto - the oracle problem. When link truly flourishes most will say they didn’t see it coming, but... THE WRITING IS ON THE WALL. Just connect the dots.

4055 2018-10-16 15:27:27 USDT was the first and currently most successful stable coin so yeah that is why it dominates the market cap -- I welcome competition and the new stablecoins to take market share though -- it is overall healthy for the crypto ecosystem
4056 2018-10-16 15:27:24 momentum obviously lagging lol

4066 2018-10-16 15:26:06 First you said the markets would close entirely, now you sound like a crypto cheerleader. Are you confused or just admitting defeat?

4069 2018-10-16 15:25:46 Saw a big CT account (65k followers) yesterday say they had no idea what to do with the Tether situation so they’d wouldn’t be trading it. I said wouldn’t you buy cheap $USDT and make an easy profit when it goes back to a dollar? #GoodCall #Bitcoin #Crypto

4086 2018-10-16 15:23:53 I thought China banned crypto.
4087 2018-10-16 15:23:48 Why the future of crypto and blockchain is exciting:
 Fidelity launches a new institutional brokerage and custody for crypto.
 Bloomberg host event where hedge funds say they’re interested in crypto investments.
Goldman Sachs will use BAKKT infrastructure for crypto custody
4088 2018-10-16 15:23:32 On the plus side, the writer calls XRP "ripple" throughout the article, which makes him the hero we need.
4089 2018-10-16 15:23:30 Does anyone know anything about crypto-currency and how it all works? Can not get my head round it whatsoever.

4092 2018-10-16 15:23:14 Les GAFAMs auront le dernier mot. Facebook exploite les données banquaires pendant qu'Amazon comme l'explique @jattali offre un accès à  un marché plus vaste que bon nombre de pays, lui donnant une légitimé pour lancer sa crypto monnaie.

4161 2018-10-16 15:14:12 All crypto also has an intrinsic value of zero. So one is not automatically better than the other. Fiat has the major advantage of state and tax base backing backing ensuring it will always be accepted as payment. Crypto, crucially does not.

4207 2018-10-16 15:08:31 Cyrpto colonists should be a thing. The practice of going to a country, not your own, thinking you can profit off the native crypto projects, or at least sell their tokens to the world, & market them to the world, in hope of decentralizing the world by building out a monoploy

4212 2018-10-16 15:07:43 As they should be. Crypto is mostly, not slightly, a network of scams. True blockchain tech like what you're seeing at Vechain is legit and should be differentiated if possible. Good for China.

4226 2018-10-16 15:06:15 Might not work = might not be THE oracle solution.  Obviously oracles are a necessity, I just find it baffling how LINK is being valued by the market when that is glaringly obvious and it makes me feel like I'm missing something.

4295 2018-10-16 14:59:37 Good call sir. An exchange listing helps too 
4296 2018-10-16 14:59:30 That's sad really. We do hair extensions business for long time now and Stripe closed our account too. No reason but it was a high risk. This is one of the reasons I got so heavily into Crypto in 13'. Like you said.
4297 2018-10-16 14:59:16 Qui a encore des doutes sur le fait que TeamEnMarx est un crypto compte de TeamMacron ?
4298 2018-10-16 14:59:02 You’re damn right it isn’t

4301 2018-10-16 14:58:56 Both Fidelity and Bakkt will compete. 

They want to sell their crypto related offerings to their customers and attract new ones. 

These players are the ones who will promote crypto for us. It is in their own best interest to do so. 

Again, it is all about #incentives
4302 2018-10-16 14:58:46 Sadly, big donations from Ripple would probably earn a lot a favor from Trump.

4308 2018-10-16 14:58:11 A great way to ensure a "successful" second #ICO is to funnel funds from your first ICO to hit the soft cap. By doing so, you can buy up cheap private sale tokens to dump on people later AND ensure no one gets refunded since soft cap has already been surpassed. I see you. #Crypto

4310 2018-10-16 14:57:57 Why does the price of Tether go up and down, I thought It was Suppose to be Stable, 1 tether = 1 Dollar, but on CMC it' only .98 cents.

4329 2018-10-16 14:55:40 Well a #Crypto desk would certainly boost growth. Seeing as how Tom Jessop @Fidelity came from Chain now Interstellar and prior... GOLDMAN. Ya think GS would be looking to launch something...

4331 2018-10-16 14:55:32 Or perhaps actually use crypto as it was intended? And help loosen the grip of the existing financial infrastructure/institutions?  

On/Off ramps will always exist, but we shouldn't treat it as a cornerstone of a "legit" crypto business; more as a necessary evil for adoption

4361 2018-10-16 14:52:10 It’s certainly happening and, whilst of course this doesn’t secure the future of crypto, it provides validation for the current thinking on where this might end up. More brain and cash money power to testing hypotheses. Great work by F. moving things on.

4370 2018-10-16 14:49:37 Based on the chart, I can see BTC between $6000-7500 by March 2019. We will once again see an increase March 2020 where BTC will be flirting around $10,000-$15,000.

4393 2018-10-16 14:47:07 The odds are probably stacked against tokens, but I'm with the Civil optimists that "this is a potential avenue for growth"

Do I think tokens will really move the needle? Probably not... it really depends on how many people want to buy tokens / crypto. That's a huge dependency

4439 2018-10-16 14:42:20 Hey Olga Crypto thank you for the follow! I believe by now you’ve already heard a lot about the Blockchain / Cryptocurrency / Bitcoin Investment & Bot Trading? Guess what! I’ve have found something that is allowing YOU to earn passively with out having to put in extra work! …
4440 2018-10-16 14:42:12 Exactly what I have been thinking about lately. Some think by shrieking at bitcoin or trying to outlaw it it will go away. Crypto is an outcome of social forces- what were the necessary conditions?
4441 2018-10-16 14:42:09 At this point I’m not sure how anybody can be bearish on #bitcoin and #crypto..

- Fidelity (managing over $7 TRILLION in assets) getting involved 
- BAKKT in Nov 
- ETF *soon*
- tether near certain to be solvent

...etc to name a few

My body is ready for whats coming

4477 2018-10-16 14:38:03 As Far as using the Tokens from the blockchain is still a question . And this is not only a concern in China , but every part of the world . So all I get from this is that China has only blocked ICO'S when compared to other countries and $crypto Advertising.

4583 2018-10-16 14:25:55 I started at Goldman three weeks before the Lehman collapse. 1% moves in the S&P shake people to the core today. Try 10%. Traditional markets became too boring after that initiation, crypto is now my home.

4588 2018-10-16 14:25:06 Obviously. But they're more stable than crypto, which can be useful. Not saying to keep all your money in a stable coin. But keeping some money in there isn't a bad idea.

4605 2018-10-16 14:22:43 >Biggest use case for crypto == digital cash
I very much disagree. I'd say it's the most OBVIOUS use case, and the lowest hanging fruit on the potential tree.
The most important use cases are still being developed, discovered, figured out.

4607 2018-10-16 14:22:25 When you think about it, a vast input of tether should logically make btc increase in price. The supply is tether/USD and the demand is bitcoin.

Supply goes up and the demand stays the same. 

Econ101:more buyers than sellers equals an increase in price.

4637 2018-10-16 14:18:56 The fact that investment funds like Fidelity are branching out into $BTC shows that there is clearly a demand for these new assets from their big investors. These funds deal with TRILLIONS of dollars. How anyone can be bearish on Crypto & Bitcoin in the long run is beyond me

4729 2018-10-16 14:06:35 Crypto competitors: USDT, TrueUSD...etc, are limited in scalability due to being backed by USD. However, CryptoBonds of Twogap expands very fast and there is virtually no limit because of Bond's back.

4794 2018-10-16 13:59:08 Cost of mining as intrinsic value. Utility+scarcity is added value. Utility alone is not a value proposition. Air has the most utility for a living being but it's free.

4797 2018-10-16 13:58:50 Sometimes - I can't flip crypto as effficently as I'd like to at work. Slow on the uptake!
4798 2018-10-16 13:58:44 Research @brockpierce & his pedophile crew b4 fawning over him. Sexually abused as a kid, turned pedo, wanting to live overseas where consent age is lowered. Victim became the perpetrator. God is not mocked. A man reaps what he sows. You're a dirtbag, Brock. Get therapy & repent.
4799 2018-10-16 13:58:36 That makes sense & appreciate the clarification. @Fidelity’s Blockchain team is world class (worked with them for 4 years).

I still believe however that much of the crypto community hasn’t yet embraced or respected traditional FIs and their future role in crypto’s LT success.

But Monero is simply not building useful tools for real world adoption. But clearly that is not your market anyhow.

4806 2018-10-16 13:57:57 Crypto will struggle for some time. Great technologies are complicated - they have to be understood to be used
4807 2018-10-16 13:57:48 Fair enough.

My main thought was that I can't see 'normal' investors buying a stable coin for reasons in & of itself quite yet. So I don't see a sell off (totally out of crypto) as a strong contender explanation.

These are very niche products, with limited purpose now.

4810 2018-10-16 13:57:05 My idea is live off the rewards. I get 115 a day from crypto chain or tron Vietnam when I vote. 3500 a month roughly. At $2 that’s $7k. $3 $10k. By doing it this way I never touch my main stash and then when it hits $100 retire for life lottery style. Just my thoughts

4849 2018-10-16 13:52:41 Thats the big issue right now. People invest in crypto. They don’t use it as it was meant to be used. The volatility is killing the usecase.

4851 2018-10-16 13:52:36 always hold on to cryptonight POW coins like $RYO,this type of coins always hold their value during $BTC swings,& if patient enough U will be X2, X3 maybe X10, perfect time to mine or buy since is cheap,just look at $LOKI,is already in the 30 cent area,expecting the same for $RYO
4852 2018-10-16 13:52:24 @Gece_x @HeyTaiZen @xRajTheOne
4853 2018-10-16 13:52:13 Yes your method is called daytrading there’s people that swing trade there’s other people that are just investors HodL  some coins that you daytrade I highly recommend other people not to invest on ; million ways to make money you could even mine crypto currency 
4854 2018-10-16 13:51:56 Did you get a chance to look at Digibyte?
4855 2018-10-16 13:51:50 電波干渉は避けられませんよね
でもなにも干渉が無ければ理論上可能かなと思いまして
4856 2018-10-16 13:51:48 Yes that is my profile. Your point?
4857 2018-10-16 13:51:46 Would definitely subscribe but Rachel Maddow doesn’t even have a tenth of the brain cells you have. Intellectual talks with crypto , tech and some political people seems like a solid show
4858 2018-10-16 13:51:45 It is also a value proposition. 100 billion tokens printed with a key stroke and owned by a centralized entity has no value proposition.

4861 2018-10-16 13:50:58 If you are in crypto you have to make sure you are not losing a connection with everything new. That's so easy to stay where you are not improving your skills and knowledge. Beware of it! And here's one of the reasons why. That's actually auspicious project. Have a look at this!
4862 2018-10-16 13:50:53 I do think crypto environment needs to become more stable otherwise we are in danger of sucking an already hysterical mainstream into this madness, might be the tipping point for the masses totally losing their shit!

4871 2018-10-16 13:50:08 Uh-huh. And don’t you think that this hydro power might otherwise have been used to heat homes and so forth, thereby reducing the total amount of carbon converted by our whole energy system? I read somewhere that Crypto is essentially using up ALL new renewable sources coming on.
4872 2018-10-16 13:49:42 I think this project will be successful as transparency is excatly what we need to strengthen in the crypto world. 
Team are very strong . Good luck team. #Mixin_Network $Xin

4874 2018-10-16 13:49:16 @Cryptolite_  Some guy totally stole your YouTube video on Zebi $ZCO.  GOES UP - CRYPTO - published it as their own on Sept 22nd.  It's a good video and I didn't mind seeing it again, but I think it's BS that he stole it after you spent so much time researching $ZCO to make it.
4875 2018-10-16 13:49:13 no you don't

4885 2018-10-16 13:47:59 This idea is so great. Thanks for being helping the community. However, since I am not a crypto trader, is it possible for someone to share big transactions in other markets, such as the Foreign Exchange? Do you know someone who does this?
4886 2018-10-16 13:47:58 Yes, true ownership of your #assets is one of the real hallmarks of the #crypto revolution. Some established firms don't get it yet, but the #change is happening an an ever increasing pace. #blockchain

1.
the regard that something is held to deserve; the importance, worth, or usefulness of something.
"your support is of great value"
4964 2018-10-16 13:37:33 has a far greater value that crypto and it can be touched physical. I don't think Gold will ever be replaced and I'll take that any day over some piece of code on the web that i may or may not have or get to when I want it

4976 2018-10-16 13:35:43 Tellement solide et sous évalué. $HPB est le seul à combiner Hardware et Software pour améliorer l'enjeu #blockchain d'aujourd'hui : la scalabilité. Il faudra certainement attendre un exchange comme #binance pour le voir s'envoler. Pour info : il existe un telegram FR $HPB.

4978 2018-10-16 13:35:14 This is how @ripple cuts off $XRP from #Bitcoin to the general audience and clears the mining vs Consensus debate in high-profile fashion.

4979 2018-10-16 13:35:07 @StocksToTrade if your platform is going to be able to integrate with Robinhood as a brokerage, does this mean you will also be able to trade crypto’s as well as stocks?
4980 2018-10-16 13:35:06 Awesome! We are just integrating email authentication and then we will relaunch all modules again. @CryptoBatesGrou will be in touch once this is done.

4987 2018-10-16 13:34:15 You realize BTC was 'printed out of thin air' too don't you? Mining is an incentive for securing the blockchain. The method of consensus has nothing to do with creation. Mining is a waste of resources and has led to the centralization of BTC. Deterministic consensus is superior.
4988 2018-10-16 13:34:14 Excellent development and I like the idea behind August927, a blockchain based venture capitalist with crypto assets portfolio management system.#August927

5000 2018-10-16 13:33:08 Sometimes I just spend weeks not posting anything on twitter or trade just so I can monitor you all. 

See what trades you post. What you say. What you delete. Market sentiment. Watch the charts like a movie.

Active observing is just as important as inactive trading.

5010 2018-10-16 13:31:55 That's what the regulatory bodies are for. If we want to self police the Crypto Ecosystem, we first need to grow up and change the way we interact and treat each other. The road to hell is paved with good intentions.
5011 2018-10-16 13:31:44 Great question!

My expertise is building high converting sales processes (web content to email series to sales scripts that work)

5118 2018-10-16 13:18:17 Now is time to be risk on, when everything is at its lows.

Once alts have run 3-4x from lows and everyone is calling "Alt szn!!!", that's the time to go risk off.

5123 2018-10-16 13:18:06 if you think the whole crypto market will go down you should be properly hedged short on mex, not a stablecoin that’s incredibly shady like tether. Or simply just sell back into fiat. The entire point of a stablecoin is to keep you safe but how can u be safe when it dumps 8% ?

5134 2018-10-16 13:16:50 @SatoshiLite: Running a node in crypto is analogous to having eyes in the fiat world. Without eyes, you rely on others to verify a bill you received is not counterfeit. Without a node, you rely on others to verify your coins and protect their immutability. Why would you give…

5146 2018-10-16 13:15:45 I really like this move @MarkHakkarinen. This re-confirms my belief Smart is heading in right direction.

5224 2018-10-16 13:08:22 This is the furthest thing from being centralized. The Nodes rotate to validate the data. That way no one holder has the most power. And blockchain with AI just adds another layer to security. Its like having a double checklist.

5380 2018-10-16 12:51:51 I love crypto, but lately I have actually been *needing* it to be more widely accepted. 

The amount of time I have been wasting simply moving money around is staggering. I hate hate hate wasting my time dealing w banks
5381 2018-10-16 12:51:40 Is it really a big difference compared to regular earplugs? or just an expensive placebo?

5414 2018-10-16 12:46:33 Invest some time on studying how to open proper short positions, find some credible TA guys, watch their YouTube channels and allocate assets as well. The key is to thrive in a bear market not survive the bear market.

5423 2018-10-16 12:45:28 The U.S. and the world need to sit down and stop ignoring Bitcoin. They should establish regulations and laws to regulate Bitcoin. Why do people allow machinery or services onto the market without rules to govern them. First, people have to be harmed or killed before laws.
5424 2018-10-16 12:45:27 Crypto competitors: USDT, TrueUSD...etc, are limited in scalability due to being backed by USD. However, CryptoBonds of Twogap expands very fast and there is virtually no limit because of Bond's back.

5665 2018-10-16 12:12:59 Great! Now people can sell their fiat for #crypto in Uganda 
5666 2018-10-16 12:12:51 No bias here. 
What if some of Fidelity customers decide they want to hold ETH instead? or even BCH, or XRP or any other Crypto coin. Will then there will be enough for everyone? 
The Bitcoin dominance is not written on stone and the scarcity argument is the weakest of them all.

5675 2018-10-16 12:12:05 Haha yeah, let's not. Kek though! ~
5676 2018-10-16 12:11:58 Thanks for reaching out.

Our main priority is keeping our customers crypto safe. You're correct that our main focus is on our customer experience, as well as ensuring that our platform is simple to use for everyone before supporting more cryptocurrencies. We hope this helps! 
5677 2018-10-16 12:11:31 If my understanding is correct there isn't actually a premium. Finex trades BTC pair with USDT which is only worth $.95 right now. The BTCUSD chart is misleading because it is technically BTCUSDT. If you do the math, non-tether exchanges are about 5% lower

5691 2018-10-16 12:09:40 Yep it's our chance too get on something before it gets huge.  Too bad there are so many scams out there.  Important to DYOR but that can still fail.
5692 2018-10-16 12:09:23 American told us to go wait in line with the 200 other people from our flight for rebooking and they issued us zero refunds and said to call number online to get the refund. We did and never saw a penny.

Its just the crypto market isnt great at the moment.  Plus...Argo recently doubled my hashrate free of charge so not complaining .

RISK. 

What if I never quit my job? What if I never invested my life savings into crypto early? 

Don’t think, just do it.
5702 2018-10-16 12:08:29 Delta is the best. Period. I’d pay hundreds more for a flight on delta versus American.

5794 2018-10-16 11:57:45 Coingecko now displays the trend in crypto coin price over the prior 7 days.  More telling than its previous visualization, if you ask me.
5795 2018-10-16 11:57:42 Huobi and OKEX are now launching stablecoins. Isn't that a coincidence with that Tether pump and dump? It seems as if the cartel behind crypto is just playing with all the clueless people in crypto.

Crypto Mining - an investment project dealing with mining and trading.
5801 2018-10-16 11:57:08 Dollar, OK.
Euro? It may not exist sometime soon... 

That aside, people need something to operate, not a foreign dollar. Crypto is perfect for it.
5802 2018-10-16 11:57:02 1. Netflix is now responsible for 15% of all internet traffic globally

5804 2018-10-16 11:56:49 それだ！私としては先端からラジオ波を照射して敵を焼き払って欲しい…
5805 2018-10-16 11:56:39 That's a negative. So far, only following Bitlord, on the basis of a personal recommendation.
5806 2018-10-16 11:56:38 its easier to spot when you've  literally traded through the ups and downs of a 5th wave extention before, AKA crypto in december and gold in 2011 
5807 2018-10-16 11:56:36 not soon, it will require plenty of patience as time is needed to fill up the order books to be able to carry that kind of weight in the specific corridors while the price of XRP has to increase to satisfy supply/demand. Crypto has to move forwards, right now we are at a bottom.
5808 2018-10-16 11:56:33 Gerçekten sizin gibi birini bu piyasada bulmak imkansız.mumkun değil.

5842 2018-10-16 11:52:12 Surprised to see a crypto try to leverage China-US trade war narrative for their own purposes? Well, saddle up. While state-level actors are barely involved today, control of alt money is an inevitable vector of global power. The propaganda/state-alliance seeking will be wild.

5857 2018-10-16 11:50:50 You are right! But in this case Binance will initiate the coin burn&they will not "decrease" the value. It's deflation. Imagine having a market cap of 100 and 100 coins, each worth 1. When you burn 90% of your coins, each coin will be worth 10 to match up market cap of 100 
5858 2018-10-16 11:50:50 So, go on, crypto community.

5932 2018-10-16 11:42:40 Where did this come from? Would like to see the agenda here :D
5933 2018-10-16 11:42:28 I'd have to agree with you there, great man and does so much for independent musicians and new crypto platforms to help get them off the mark, including Choon. Great choice in your #dailywavdr
5934 2018-10-16 11:42:19 A good filter for separating crypto veterans from newbies is having to provide a verified claim for the MtGox Bankruptcy proceedings.
5935 2018-10-16 11:42:18 These are some hard working guys who hooked me up with one of their products, I'm glad I can help them out with some exposure. 

Oh and I had 1 free coffee.

Mark, now that I've got your kind attention... would you be able to help inside your network. We've started a crypto bizz with a rather mindblowing product. However, we need a legacy bank account in Europe. Man, that's a struggle... Can we briefly DM if you have time?
5946 2018-10-16 11:41:21 Same...I would follow Bitlord and Cobain.  Bitlord is entertaining as hell and Cobain is an OG.

5954 2018-10-16 11:40:28 Yeah, I don't dispute that. 
But I treat information from unidentified sources with additional skepticism. It's an accountability thing.
I have no idea how bitfinex entered the conversation.
5955 2018-10-16 11:40:12 ...can't even accept facts? I hope #btc sees adoption, but it's obvious the US Govt is going to struggle with the idea of Bitcoin's centralised mining. You can cry all you want, but #xrp is the leading alternative.

5962 2018-10-16 11:39:28 Well it won't devalue your coin. Since the total amount of coins will decrease, the BNB market cap will be spread to the remaining coins, increasing single coin value to match up to #BNB 's market cap. Does not mean that its market cap will increase, but it could, due to fomo

6055 2018-10-16 11:28:54 So if you put $1 in each you would be +9 on bnb and -0.75 on omg.

9 + (-0.75) = 8.25

You would >400% profit on your initial $2. 

Pretty f well.

6066 2018-10-16 11:27:02 Cryptocurrencies should be a secured payment system for everyday life and a marvelous investment, not for illegal stuff... Cause of that, people think crypto is for drugs and weapons traffic.

But if retail investors chase the same money

EVERYONE gets richer

Retail investors need to be smarter & follow the power players

Not sh*tty small time Cryptos that will amount to nothing

6195 2018-10-16 11:09:33 I do think that Chainlink, if it works and finds a killer usecase or three, could spur a new crypto hypecycle similar to what Ethereum did.

Lots of ifs, and I'm not fully convinced yet, but oracles seem the sort of thing that could usher in a new narrative wave. Maybe.

6211 2018-10-16 11:06:48 Editor's Take | Holding Crypto Assets could be punishable under Law

 A committee headed by Subhash Chandra Garg, secretary, department of economic affairs, is likely to submit its report by December, defining the broad contours of a regulatory framework for crypto assets.
6212 2018-10-16 11:06:43 That part is actually one of they issues in UBI design. My personal fav options are: 
- All public employees salaries are defined as multiples of UBI.
- The UBI is deeply integrated into the ID/voting system.
- It's not in debt-created USD, but a crypto currency.

You did note how many pairs traded to combine into the volume you show? And that it has been going on for months?

I think this is a big signal that no one can see due to their crypto blinders.

6423 2018-10-16 10:30:44 I agree. Generally though i think people really like ICX and think it’s a good project, MN’s will give a reason for people to buy up the coins and hold. Might not 3-5x like the microcaps lately but I’m sure it’s due for atleast a 50% run and I’ll take that all day long.

6606 2018-10-16 10:00:43 Over $11 million in ERC 20 Tokens was stolen in the recent Bancor hack. The storage options are limited, and wallets only allow users to manage their Tokens via third-parties, creating a major barrier to mass adoption #cryptoking

When looking at our newly created charts you get awfully confused, recent events looking bad for crypto in the eyes of the SEC.
But, it might(and probably) trigger some sleepers to believe we have a reversal after it broke some important key levels.

I suspect we see more direct investments into crypto thanks to the services mentioned in my OP though.

6889 2018-10-16 09:20:06 Yha at the moment but its future proofing more than anything. See how Crypto shot up graphic card purchases and use. I think there will be applications that require that much bandwidth as AI gets more integrated into everyday computing.

6900 2018-10-16 09:18:15 Signs of final FUD before the complete recovery of Crypto market.  Its funny how market manipulators send their puppets out of woods whenever they wish! IMO
6901 2018-10-16 09:18:14 KYC in exchanges is to avoid fiat money laundering. KYC for a crypto I really don't get it. It is just to secure failed instant payment and make money by selling data on your consuming habits.

6907 2018-10-16 09:17:33 Crypto used to be a 'Long' only trade as well as a 'long term' only trade, but now with the influx of CFDs the dynamic has changed. It's become more of a traders product; different timescales, long and short positions and different profit expectations.

6911 2018-10-16 09:17:02 Dear #crypto community
Please stop spreading the lie that Bitcoin is mined 80% in China
it was true a few years ago but its simply not true at the moment because Bitcoin is much more decentralised!!
top countries by mining power =
1) Vietnam
2) Russia
3) US
4) Venezuela
5) Korea
6912 2018-10-16 09:16:50 way to go team, this is true #blockchain project for real #business not just some pnd crypto without real life usage 
6913 2018-10-16 09:16:30 well thank you very much for the update. i was aware binance has some shadyness and manipulation ongoing - but so was poloniex back in the day. to me this was just "part of the business" ^^
6914 2018-10-16 09:16:30 Any new xyz exchange that has referral program is going to be the next big thing brah.

6917 2018-10-16 09:16:17 It feels like we're describing two different realities. I don't recognise yours at all. Crypto doesn't work as money and has no value as an asset, blockchain doesn't do anything that can't be done better by existing technology. Is this incorrect, if so, why?
6918 2018-10-16 09:16:17 It was presented very well and I have no doubt that this will be a big success. Team support is very important in crypto money projects and this team is very good. Has greatly improved on hitting production goals on promotions since last week.

6923 2018-10-16 09:15:40 I think best way for investors and crypto companies is to change these utility tokens to security tokens. Probably it is not now clearly possible, but this will happen in future, I bet my words of vision :)
6924 2018-10-16 09:15:30 はっ(@￣□￣@;)
6925 2018-10-16 09:15:27 Did youstill  invest on crypto man?
6926 2018-10-16 09:15:22 True - I guess I mean both. Respected institutional firms standing up crypto-related products/services would definitely go a long way towards legitimatizing the space as a whole (which may make institutional investors feel more comfortable putting money into the asset class).

6934 2018-10-16 09:13:38 Incredibly stable compared to crypto and don't cost ten times their value to transact with. Crypto has no value as an asset long term. Some will make lots of money, most will lose everything.

7043 2018-10-16 08:55:10 Crypto needs to decouple from Bitcoin price influence. I think it's one of the most important issues in crypto now that needs to change. In comparison, the whole stock market doesn't move according to what Apple does. Please lead the way CZ, others will follow @cz_binance

Just ok?

Sweat and tears are put into ever tweet and reply.

How dare you
7049 2018-10-16 08:50:52 my point is: putting Fiat on your Revolut takes seconds, buying/selling crypto takes seconds. The only downside is that, at the moment, you can’t move crypto to or from Revolut to or from Binance or any other Exchange. But if you buy/sell directly on Revolut, problem don’t exist

7063 2018-10-16 08:48:28 Historically, the most successful companies make big moves, develop and launch products during bear markets.  They build a solid foundation when no one else is looking. 

It's the same in $Crypto. Look out for the projects that are building right now, they will be the winners.

Until now Binance has zero contribution to get new money to crypto. Depending on other exchanges.
7074 2018-10-16 08:46:08 Buy a hardware wallet, if you have not BEFORE even getting into crypto. 

Trezor is the best imo. Ledger is 2nd, though holds more ALTs.

7087 2018-10-16 08:44:26 time for buy more crypto.
7088 2018-10-16 08:43:53 I tested it, it looks great!
The link for deposit button (a#SellDeposit) is not updating the Deposit Crypto selector (ul.dropdownMenuOuter).
e.g.: The link is "../account/deposit#ETHDeposit", but should be "account/deposit#ETHTransfer", isnt it ?
7089 2018-10-16 08:43:44 Crypto is something I am good at, and nearly all of ICO-projects I chose were fruitful lately. I choose and place confidence in this project as well! #Buying #ICO #Blockchain @buyingcom
7090 2018-10-16 08:43:07 But if dollar colapses we have two options, USA adopting a new currency (crypto based or metal based) or hyperinflation will come. Government will start printing new dollars and prices will go up... and a pair of new shoes will cost 10x.

7092 2018-10-16 08:42:55 TA does not apply to crypto, understand intra day market dynamics and price action is the only way to trade, swing trade you’re lookin at 50% win rate at best, your negative equity will come from slippage in the long run

7141 2018-10-16 08:33:52 You are right. You speak about the exchangability of a coin. But this true also if a US merchant gets paid in Ruppee i.e.. Exchange is needed. And this solvable easily. Again. Auditability is the main issue here.

7298 2018-10-16 08:03:27 The masses aren't building things. Crypto has no real network effect there. And if there's anything that Bitcoin has proven over the years is that it will never be able to even remotely catch up. The community agenda is set to inventing narratives around perpetual stagnation.

Still, solar//wind stations built there (if any) should be contributing to an *interconnected* grid (solar/wind share of the energy mix can't be too large anyway, or the grid fails).

7326 2018-10-16 07:59:32 Coinmarketcap is assuming that $USDT is the real $DOLLAR. They are showing crypto average prices that are influenced by $USDT pairs. The only way to get the real crypto prices is to get average from @Bitstamp, @krakenfx, @coinbase, and other fiat exchanges. Investors are misled.

7356 2018-10-16 07:53:41 Due to banking / legal restrictions, they shut down the ability for consumers to buy / redeem tether and only work with institutional accounts now.  So, basically, you need to redeem through an exchange either to fiat or to other crypto and then move to a fiat gateway.

7361 2018-10-16 07:53:22 I was into ETN before any other crypto really. The CEO didn’t exude confidence in the project when he spoke and I ultimately lost faith in it. They had TONS of issues.

7376 2018-10-16 07:50:57 The problem is he lumps bitcoin in with all the 'enterprise blockchain' scammery and the shitcoins of crypto
7377 2018-10-16 07:50:55 I wouldn’t be surprised if they do, but I also don’t think it would boost the crypto market if they do either.

7384 2018-10-16 07:49:51 Take a look at @electroneum $ETN . Aiming for mass adoption especially 3rd world countries who don't have access to bank accounts. Lots of partners already, lots in pipeline. First crypto to use KYC. Lots to read up on with this coin. Gig economy, cloud mining etc.
7385 2018-10-16 07:49:45 Most of these experts pander propaganda as most people confuse currency with money. Owning Litecoin or Tron is no different than owning silver or Euro’s. They are negotiable instruments. From April 2019, crypto will be measured in 2 ways. Haves and haves not.

7418 2018-10-16 07:44:58 I derive fairly big part of my profit using crypto, and for me choosing the right project is very meaningful. Trust me, this project in indeed that good! Best thing I've ever seen! #autoblock #ICO #TheAutoBlockICO @AutoBlockX
7419 2018-10-16 07:44:56 It's fine to have the choice to do so. That option won't disappear anytime soon, especially if bitcoin proponents actively encourage continuing to make payments with CC instead of crypto. Could be related to crypto payment processors exploring cryptos with more predictable fees?

7430 2018-10-16 07:43:18 I think you struggling with the concept of keeping private monies (including crypto)and public money separate but allowing them to compete.    

Not a fair fight perhaps but better than the demented public/private monopoly we have.

7469 2018-10-16 07:38:09 The massive spike was due to the Tether (USDT) selloff which was triggered by the fact that it was trading at 85 cents on crypto exchange Kraken combined with recent negative news regarding the legitimacy of the asset's dollar pegged value.

7482 2018-10-16 07:35:59 Cause if BTC target market adopts btc or the 1%

One TXN each from them would fill BTC block for almost a year 

So all non 1% TXN would need to be of-chain

Is that not a logical assumption?

7486 2018-10-16 07:35:09 Could it be? That this Tether FUD is just massive money coming back into crypto from the sidelines (tether)? All instruments will drop with lower demand unless, obviously, some of the overprinted tether is taken out of circulation. Just a guess...not that I have any frikkin idea.

7504 2018-10-16 07:31:56 The point is the BTC speculation is based on the fact that mass adoption is coming ?

Masses bring high fees do you remember dec17 it's not long ago

Fees were 50$ and even at that price it brought a wait cause others were willing to pay a 100

That would constitute 10% of 500

7518 2018-10-16 07:30:41 Well, that's interesting. We don't have a united community nor companies (apparently) behind it. So, taxing would be tough. A solution in my opinion would be in the economics of the crypto: as long as there the profits offset the costs, else doesn't mind.

that's not how it works man. it's actually trending down against the real bitcoin since it was released and fake pumped. it's now a failing experiment where people are abandoning ship..

7611 2018-10-16 07:14:37 There absolutely are better products! MimbleWimble provides significantly better scaling properties than Monero, and ZCash’s zkSNARKs provide much stronger untraceability characteristics than Monero (but a much smaller privacyset and much higher systemic risks).

7614 2018-10-16 07:14:25 Having a will does not automatically mean that one’s bitcoin wealth will get passed down to loved ones. Private keys are still needed to unlock crypto wallets, which is why individuals need to leave clear instructions on how their heirs can access their fortunes.

7668 2018-10-16 07:06:19 Making a claim like “his industry significance is fading fast” is just silly. It presumes I even have industry significance in the first place, and then makes some leap of logic based on zero evidence. Grandiose claims MUST be accompanied by rational explanation.

7670 2018-10-16 07:05:50 Paying in crypto can be complicated and that's something bway set out to change when he began #Digits, a crypto payment processor that connects any 16-digit debit or credit card number to a crypto wallet, turning that card into a crypto card.
7671 2018-10-16 07:05:47 JohnArnoldFndtn B3_MillerValue Corrected for CPI inflation, that $2B was $8.09B in 2018. 
So in 1977 Harvard had the equivalent of $5.1M in endowment per freshman. 
In 2017, it had $22.3M per freshman. Still, a 4.3x!
7672 2018-10-16 07:05:47 Bear market hypothesis: People who want (others) to buy are noisy. People who are forced to sell are quiet. Makes sentiment analysis harder.

7781 2018-10-16 06:45:31 "The value of Bitcoin has plunged in the past year." -from today's Bloomberg on Fidelity crypto custody.

The statement is simply not true. A year ago today the price of Bitcoin was $5,200.53. As I type this it's $6474.72. Does Bloomberg understand basic subtraction?
7782 2018-10-16 06:45:18 The problem rn is converting back to fiat.  Yes, to make this idea relevant that’s has to be an option until crypto is accepted like credit cards

7790 2018-10-16 06:44:19 Tips5: CZ, the nicknamet of Binance CEO, stands for the pinyin of his real name Changpeng Zhao (赵长鹏).
豆知識⑤：BinanceのCEOの本名は、赵长鹏（zhàochánɡpéng） といいます。通称であるCZは、中国語名のピンイン（Chánɡpéng Zhào）から取られています。

7836 2018-10-16 06:38:35 I think were all getting a bit too greedy with our profits!
Even a 2x is better than almost getting 10x and then going -5x!

If you start with $10 and 2x your money 20 times you will have over $10M. 

This shouldn't be this hard right??

7842 2018-10-16 06:37:15 Kind of funny that bitfinex tells on Their site that the problem will be fixed within a week and Binance dont say anything
7843 2018-10-16 06:37:07 Sure maybe short term. But the FUD and loss of trust in a major crypto institution would be very damaging. Look at what happened when binance was "hacked" (a bot was taken over and pumped via). Bitcoin dumped nearly 15%.
7844 2018-10-16 06:37:02 “Highly informative” lmao you played yourself everything tyler stated was completely wrong, if he would have done a little research he would known this is one of the best projects in the crypto space

7862 2018-10-16 06:34:47 You're right the spike came from some BS within the Crypto cesspool- but it was the faux USD tether causing issues, not insider trading.

7917 2018-10-16 06:22:11 @Nouriel here's a thought for you, what if we the people demanded that the government only use bitcoin or another crypto on a public Blockchain, that should end most of the world's corruption very fast. But the problem with people like you is you have no desire for change.
7918 2018-10-16 06:22:03 I'm very picky when it comes to crypto. I choose to support a project if only the idea is excellent and the team is super professional. This project seems to be the one to trust into! @umka_freelance
7919 2018-10-16 06:21:54 Crypto wouldn't be fun without FUD. Try running a TG channel when those bombs drop. Lol. Crazy.
7920 2018-10-16 06:21:44 Why you use own tokens and not #IOTA tokens? I mean: Why build a token when there is one out of the box?

Really great project which has a huge potential. If u continue doing such big steps in the development of your project, u will become the most successful company in the future.

7925 2018-10-16 06:20:21 Whoa.... That’s a strange “Coincidence”.
7926 2018-10-16 06:20:16 People who say crypto is not backed by anything lack imagination.  Crypto is backed by imagination.  If you don't have any, then it is useless to you outside of price action

7934 2018-10-16 06:18:32 Almost bought a Gallardo a few years ago and decided to compare new and preowned pricing. Was pretty surprised how low miles many cars had along with the amount of depreciation was silly to me. Bought land instead.

7944 2018-10-16 06:16:39 Surprisingly for most channels it’s higher hanging than it appears at first glance. If you google “saveonsend crypto” there’s an interesting writeup

7948 2018-10-16 06:16:05 factomか…そいつにはあまり良い思い出がないな…ICOに参加していたんだが、いざ使えるようになったって段階でまさかのCUI操作で、不安が市場に響いて一時価値が購入価格を割ってな。あれはすごい体験だった…今は中国政府との謎の癒着が垣間見れるから、あんまり手を付けるんじゃないぞ。
7949 2018-10-16 06:16:00 @QravityCom #Qravity @QravityCom   This is one of the best crypto projects of the 21st century! I hope they won't let me down...

7956 2018-10-16 06:14:19 Tips1：Bì, which often comes at the end of cryptocurrency names, means "coin" in Chinese.＊
豆知識①：币（bì）は中国語で「通貨」を意味するため、ほとんどのコインの名称には币（bì）がついています。

7971 2018-10-16 06:10:17 I think sarcasm is overused in social media, specially in crypto Twitter. And so are terms like "fraud".

The laudest (not the smartest) voices within the BTC supporters seem to troll with sarcasm repeteadly as virtue-singaling for the in-group's groupthink. All spin. Zero info.
7972 2018-10-16 06:10:08 Sounds like he is looking for followers that's about it
7973 2018-10-16 06:09:57 I recommend to pay Your attention to a new investment project in cryptocurrency. The team has made the site easy to use Token sale is going to blast . #ICO #SRTcoin #SRTgroup #bitcoin #cryptocurrency #crypto #eos

7976 2018-10-16 06:09:27 That’s completely correct. Since every blog post is automatically added to Direct, there’s very little need for custom messages. But the main issue for sending custom Directs is the public nature of the hashtag. It’s a temporary solution mainly meant for the announcements. :)

Everyone in the industry agrees the project is a complete failure and no one has an idea what you did with all the money. You provided no transparency into your expenses and your compensation. 100% bad actors.

8048 2018-10-16 05:58:05 Commentators often seem surprised when companies make moves, invest, or launch products during crypto bear markets. They then act confused when bull markets return.

8178 2018-10-16 05:34:47 This is how the establishment pigeonholes you.  Lawsuits are expensive and time consuming so pick you battles wisely.  This is the exact reason Bitcoin and crypto need mass adoption.  Fuck the gatekeepers.

8206 2018-10-16 05:29:41 The best part about crypto and blockchain is the ease of access, ease of tracking and KYC and AML are way easier to manage for a regulated gambling company. We have the best platform for this, proof will be when we show it.  Stay tuned.

8350 2018-10-16 05:03:13 Quite simple, his power lies with fiat currencies and deep down he knows he will be proven wrong about his “scam” accusations against #crypto. One will always defend whatever is in their best interest and even become irrational, as long as they remain in control of their money.
8351 2018-10-16 05:03:13 He is just pointing out what happened a few months later in December 2017. Crypto is unpredictable and anything is possible.  He is trying to help the community stay positive in this bear market which IMO is a great thing.  Better than a leader that is preaching doom and gloom.
8352 2018-10-16 05:03:10 Probably both. But I would rate idiot over advisor.

Folks are somehow trying to correlate stocks and crypto. Not sure why they are doing that? Bitcoin etc will do what it’s going to do regardless.
8358 2018-10-16 05:02:09 Do we have any  catalyst for MFT ?
8359 2018-10-16 05:02:05 Blockchain technology is the underlying system for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Scores can be developed, or by usage of websites and apps. #Bitozz #Exchange #Blockchain #Trading #Crypto
8360 2018-10-16 05:02:05 Exactly my point: When you call up a TradingView chart for Binance BTC/USDT it reads BTC/USD not USDT - that's therefore false info. All my balances and coin values in Binance are indicated as $ when in fact they are $t - that's false.

I have a few channels
I cannot find a route to my grocer

I open one

The same with my friend but thanks to my channel he now has a route

He uses my entire balance

Can I buy at the shop NO

If we all had a channel with the grocer

8454 2018-10-16 04:47:53 Exactly. Plus, people trust fidelity. They don’t think fidelity will be careless when investing into crypto for them via ETF. Therefore people will be more willing to allocate funds to it.

8470 2018-10-16 04:45:30 The recovery was due to people getting back in tether after the BTC run to 10K and small altseason.

Don't you know that Netflix uses local routing nodes to cache & offload local traffic locally, very similar to the way lightning works.

8543 2018-10-16 04:31:32 Dollar pledged USDT for what purpose. We can use credit, debit. $ value fluctuations affect directly for usdt. We need crypto. Not another form of US Dollar.
8544 2018-10-16 04:31:09 I’m more of the Buffett mentality that reputation is the only thing that matters in this business... but if you’re already offering funds with no management fee maybe rolling the dice on crypto is next logical step.

8560 2018-10-16 04:27:24 Thank you @finchify for this really great idea of running this #EOS learning program

No wonder @finchify is being asked to be a  mentor by @SVK_Crypto & @c_storry at upcoming hackthons

We heard about @finchify's nomination on @BlockchainZack's @icoalert podcast

8583 2018-10-16 04:23:54 @lagroelem92 @kisayhs96 @cryptombraider
8584 2018-10-16 04:23:52 Agreed. There are consultants in every industry. Lots of people have money and are interested in investing in crypto but don't know a thing about the market or TA. Finding a good mentor is wise and if the mentor/trading guru is legit those folks will make their money back easily.

8636 2018-10-16 04:13:17 Some people think given the same total supply volume, a crypto has the same scarcity regardless of whether it's PoW or PoS. Even if energy was infinite and abundant, at a quantum/mathematical level PoW is always more scarce. I don't see PoS ever overtaking PoW for SoV use case.

8638 2018-10-16 04:12:51 If they are holding crypto they prob have a trading desk for their "assets / liabilities" which means maybe a trader isn't that good and lost a lot of the "assets" on risky bets
8639 2018-10-16 04:12:42 Oh, my apologies, I was giving you the benefit of the doubt. I didn't think you were actually asking them to post FALSE TRADE PRICES on their trade pairs.  If you want actual price, use Coinmarketcap like everyone else.
8640 2018-10-16 04:12:27 In reality BTC can't even handle the 1%

Which millionaire is ok with one high value TXN in about 10 months

This is basic math

BTC does 250 000 TXN a day

And the 1% is 

70 000 000/250 000 =280 days 

And that means 10 months of fee war

Imagine that

8644 2018-10-16 04:10:30 Yeah. He’s completely irrelevant and this is the most attention he’s received all year. I shouldn’t reward him with attention for being such a douchebag, but attacking the nicest person in crypto really set me off. 
<deep breath>
Geoff can slide back into irrelevancy now.
8645 2018-10-16 04:10:02 Haha, really? So there's real BTC and BTC price. Crypto will kill me
8646 2018-10-16 04:09:25 It is always like that. People are still living with uncertainties about BTC and cryptocurrencies in their mind. That is why we need some sort of regulations in crypto.

8648 2018-10-16 04:09:18 No. You're following my line of thinking. Because my real question is, how or where do we draw the line from simple mathematical truths and abstract truths about the cosmos? Or better yet, blend them together with truth about astrophysics.

8673 2018-10-16 04:05:20 yes, but I don't expect institutions to rush into this as they already have exposure to these assets in non-tokenized way; what their portfolios need now is exposure to native crypto assets such as bitcoin $BTC

8675 2018-10-16 04:04:40 India may look at amending existing laws that could make holding of crypto assets, "other than those not approved by the government" , a punishable offence. It looks like govt will regulate cryptocurrency.
8676 2018-10-16 04:03:50 Lol. No. Scott Brown started it. She has had to defend herself for years. She has not taken advantage of this "privilege" and the issue is 100‰ purely driven by conservatives. So yeah. Gtfo.

What else?
8685 2018-10-16 04:01:36 @Nouriel frames all of 'crypto' as shitcoins. 

His real error is not setting bitcoin apart. It's actually #bitcoin vs shitcoins (#fiat-shitcoins + #crypto-shitcoins).

8702 2018-10-16 03:58:53 The problem is it's a broken crypto. You can't turn it in and get $1 for it. 

Greshams law will grind tether to fractions of a dollar, unless we see real audits. I'd hardly call it insignificant if $2.7 bln goes poof.

8726 2018-10-16 03:54:10 How would tether collapsing suddenly make everyone in the world buy bitcoin? People will simply sell usdt for btc then sell to another stable, then the market can continue going down and complete the market cycle.

8729 2018-10-16 03:53:37 I like: Lack of internal controls (or outright fraud) means a crypto company accidentally implemented fractional-reserve banking when it tried to implement blockchain banknotes.
8730 2018-10-16 03:53:34 When centralized institutions overstep like government, central banks and many social networks recently have I focus less on condemnation but exaltation of decentralized solutions in this case social networks like Mastodon and private money like crypto. #AmLiberty #BitBlockCrypt

8764 2018-10-16 03:47:56 Barely permanent. I expect an attempt to crash the market to 5k or so and make every weak hand sell btc just like they sold tether into btc. Once that is accomplished, there is no reason why btc should remain so cheap. One can buy whole of bitmex order book upto 16.4k with 200mil
8765 2018-10-16 03:47:42 goon u really think those exhanges going to allowed the panic about the tether situation ? think logic ... no way. they have the power and they will solve this on the background.. slowly we will get rid of usdt. as i think its shady aswell. look at oke x exhange. they alrdy added

8805 2018-10-16 03:41:05 Hahaha you'd hope not  I'm just trying to provoke some thought for perhaps less seasoned crypto investors on what it really means to be your own bank. eg. If your house burned down and you only got out with the clothes on your back, would you also lose your retirement fund?

8831 2018-10-16 03:38:04 So just like the Comex for $gold and $silver yet you still advocate those assets for purchase.  So $crypto is an asset to invest in just choose the right exchange or avenue $eth $medx
8832 2018-10-16 03:37:57 Nothing has really changed in 2018 with the crypto market. The money with means to bust it loose from the BTC-centric gamesmanship is still sidelined. Pump the majors, squeeze profits to BTC, extract fiat, repeat.
8833 2018-10-16 03:37:27 Yes usually shorting but this time pump it!!

8858 2018-10-16 03:32:04 You’re not even making coherent sentences. Anything more than 10-15% a year is an inconsistent return.

8861 2018-10-16 03:31:48 A year ago this time, news that Fidelity was entering institutional crypto would have shot the market up a gajjilion %. The fact that it has not is GOOD. Less moon / lambo, more building.
8862 2018-10-16 03:31:45 Anyone foolish enough to buy bitcoin through fidelity probably shouldn’t be in crypto. Anyone invested prior to 2015 would understand why.
8863 2018-10-16 03:31:36 Awesome, best team in crypto
8864 2018-10-16 03:31:33 This is where stable coins take off. Not Tether! Real provable math based coins. No one is using volatile Cryptos at least not their entire savings in it. Once into Crypto no need for fiats as adoption accelerates. In US they can’t legally cut off on ramps.
8865 2018-10-16 03:31:25 TF is 'crypto twitter'?

8924 2018-10-16 03:18:28 William you could argue the crypto bull run here has gotten stronger throughout the day as tether has been rebounding as well - it doesn’t appear tether money is the catalyst the last 3-4 hours
8925 2018-10-16 03:18:25 Are you describing yourself or @_Kevin_Pham ? Because honestly it sounds like you just described yourself. @Nouriel is trying to drive the price down more so he can buy and ride the next pump. #Crypto

8932 2018-10-16 03:17:42 Nice to see a someone else from Sydney into crypto, hope you are killing it in the market.
8933 2018-10-16 03:17:40 Crypto is really best when used to it’s full potential. When 1btc actually = 1 btc. Once btc becomes the actual stable coin and the whole world starts using it as a stable coin, that’s when crypto will really change everything. If that ever happens..

8935 2018-10-16 03:16:25 That sounded so sexual.
8936 2018-10-16 03:16:23 So the CO manufactured tether fud and sold his btc into usdt when it pumped to 7.8k, taking 1k premium. Now usdt is returning to the state of normalcy but CO has hands full of cheap money which he can either withdraw to invest in stocks or pump btc.
8937 2018-10-16 03:16:06 珍しいな。それはPeerCoinだ。どっから拾って来たんだ？それは世界初の「Proof of Stake」で動く通貨だ。ビットコインの採掘電気代がもったいないから、管理者をそのまま「金持ち」に委任したシステムだな。だけどこれには弱点があって、買い占めが起こると価値が下がるんだ。

8940 2018-10-16 03:15:05 Hey guys! Who wants 2 make some money!? I recently took a very strategic position in a crypto currency opportunity. Its a crypto trading company that is going big places! Very solid company! Im currently looking for afew leaders that can help me grow this business. Any takers?
8941 2018-10-16 03:14:59 The project is constantly attracting growing interest as a global audience and investors! The project has very ambitious plans to conquer the market! I advise everyone to participate in the purchase of tokens! #MPCXP #Cryptocurrency #blockchain #token #crypto #Airdrop
8942 2018-10-16 03:14:34 はい
8943 2018-10-16 03:14:30 That makes sense! In-game economies have overlap with real world economies, too, not just crypto. I always found it interesting that Yanis Varoufakis was the economist-in-residence at Valve, for example.

8947 2018-10-16 03:14:15 The Mahadev Protocol—uses a variance of public-private key cryptography to create an assured dialogue between classical and quantum computers so that we can verify solutions done by a quantum computer. Like mining a bitcoin? . #faceforward #Alfaenzo #blockchain #ICO #crypto
8948 2018-10-16 03:14:12 I never got why it would crash markets, even if its entire mktcap was suddenly invalidated that’s well within 1day, hell 1hr, of volatility of total crypto markets (2.5B vs 211B). And if it failed gradually it would just pump eth and btc as we saw today
8949 2018-10-16 03:14:03 The only point i want to make, which is why conservatives hate this argument is who should compensate women or the caregiver? And how? I don't believe taxes or companies should carry that brunt. People should make family choices with the understanding that it is a sacrifice

8964 2018-10-16 03:10:39 so there's a currency created by an exchange that can't sustain a relationship with a bank and repeatedly refuses to allow an audit throughout the course of an entire year or so and now that currency is ~1% of the total crypto market and  ~25% of the total crypto volume
8965 2018-10-16 03:10:12 I trade crypto and have a crypto twitter account...ive got more followers than you. Btw hodling tether doesn't make you a crypto investor.

8968 2018-10-16 03:09:51 I think you are right. Men are told to be bread winners and shamed if they are not. But given the opportunity i think we would see more at home dads. The current system forces women to miss so much work it's hard for her to compete with the mans salary thus she becomes caregiver

8989 2018-10-16 03:06:33 Maybe they can subsidize some of the mining costs by mining crypto currency using the ocean waves out there as a motion based energy source plus solar.

9056 2018-10-16 02:57:58 Haha i hear what your saying; Overblown for sure but give some credit to the man who predicted the 2008 crisis (i think his still teaching at Stern?). Economist are important in the crypto industry!
9057 2018-10-16 02:57:49 Cboe xbt 6100 - 6700 range yesterday... calls in tomorrow - 5172 volume .... $BTC price has been bet on since December 2017. No other money can break the monthly calls. Last month the high range was called in Sep 19. Hence the jump. Everyone thinks we are manipulated.... betting.

9065 2018-10-16 02:56:01 No ones out to get you. I like vechain and the supply element. I’m trying to be objective here, I’ve been in Chico group since it was under 1000 members. What do you want me to say??
9066 2018-10-16 02:55:51 My last point does coincide with the research VOX shared in their episode, but $0.09 pay disparity is not reflective of a major issue. This could be as minuscule as career choice, tenure or different skill sets. It does not prove sexism or rampant disparity due to gender
9067 2018-10-16 02:55:43 Blockchain without crypto is pointless
9068 2018-10-16 02:55:29 I agree...but I don't think banks are done with BTC yet....I feel lot more grinding is left. there will be few rallies here and there. We will see.

9074 2018-10-16 02:54:16 I completely agree with that.
9075 2018-10-16 02:54:02 $xbi is definitely not a scam
9076 2018-10-16 02:53:47 Will they accept security token?
9077 2018-10-16 02:53:41 What's interesting is that the 2017 bull run might've been triggered by Tether concerns, leading to selling it for btc, which lead to a positive feedback loop of market participants seeing a breakout and piling on over time. I remain skeptical of this run until 2 HHs on HTF tho
9078 2018-10-16 02:53:38 Thx to CRYPTO STATE for making the video for the activity! It is Great!
9079 2018-10-16 02:53:29 As a prof in crypto for 5 years, I can frankly say that this ICO-project is so high-potential. This is, definitely, what the market has been looking for. #ICOVOCO @ICOVOCO
9080 2018-10-16 02:52:52 Indeed, even if hashgraph were to be successful beyond anyone’s imagination it does not follow necessarily that the currency would be worth more than BTC so that could be a good move. Im not a bitcoin expert and don’t claim any special knowledge in buying crypto currencies.
9081 2018-10-16 02:52:41 If a smaller country went all in on crypto tech - they could be a superpower in 10 years.??
9082 2018-10-16 02:52:17 Well, if this complaint is any indication, he's in good company with the Trump administration.

9086 2018-10-16 02:51:18 I respectfully disagree as @Bleeding_Crypto is on a level I can understand I’m not trained in this. #profits thanks to the $25/month class, group, calls, information more importantly they teach how not to lose money #cryptotrading

9093 2018-10-16 02:50:31 Pretty sure everyone is working on crypto services at the moment. The difference might be that some we are aware of and some have chosen not to tell us yet. This is the future and that is no longer a crazy statement, period.
9094 2018-10-16 02:50:10 I'm very exacting when it comes to crypto. I wish to support a project if only the idea is topnotch and the team is super experienced. This project seems to be the one to trust into! #MerittProtocol #ICO

9096 2018-10-16 02:48:51 Just some clarifications:
-Saying we have a marketing plan is not a marketing plan. All crypto say that. 
-They don't have 400 partners, they have 400 in their network which they can promote their product to in hopes of partnering with them.
9097 2018-10-16 02:48:25 As a parent of high school Junior, I'm going thru this right now. The costs are ridiculously high, I can't afford to send him plus my other 2 to college.

9114 2018-10-16 02:45:19 She isn't asking whether private keys are easy to steal, she's asking why crypto is easy to steal. It is, why deny it, there are literally billions getting stolen... 

Lots of answer: multi-sig, hold own keys, better custodians, that's why you question an expert like @valkenburgh
9115 2018-10-16 02:45:18 What about planning time out and creating at least 50% of the meaningful tweets before the week starts? Is that a feasible option?

9120 2018-10-16 02:43:54 Have to admit, I was pretty stoked when the news broke earlier today. Now if Nasdaq will just come down off the fence...
9121 2018-10-16 02:43:37 Agree with @xrptrump on this. Don’t be surprise if their is a bug in the sidechain, and what you thought was receipt of your BTC or ETH actually is nothing more than a book entry, and the Crypto you just bought is in somebody else’s bags.
9122 2018-10-16 02:43:09 At that scale stability is rigidity. Money is a political tool and should be dynamic, favouring all people, not just few assholes. Crypto won’t solve that automagically, actually it could concentrate power in the hands of even less people, good for slavery
9123 2018-10-16 02:43:01 Can someone ask scammer @muse_crypto how $evi doing? lol. I know it’s tanking. @EvimeriaIO did a mistake by appointing tainted name in crypto space as an advisor. $xbi $kubo
9124 2018-10-16 02:42:58 Which FISA warrant? The one that came months before the dossier's publication? You do understand that no judge would sign off on a FISA warrant based on an article from 2007, right? You can't be that gullible.

9132 2018-10-16 02:42:11 Stay out of the way with government regulation on crypto, blockchain, and AI would be a great help. Thank you kind sir.
9133 2018-10-16 02:42:02 4/ For incumbents, a closed economy wins when crypto ecosystems are immature (hence opening your economy does not measurably increase liquidity, exposure, or interoperability). An open economy makes sense only when it dramatically shifts the demand curve for their items.
9134 2018-10-16 02:41:54 Stable coin should be always 1 dollar precisely. Not 99 cent not 99.9 no especially not 87 cents. Just 1 dollar manipulating bastards.

9135 2018-10-16 02:41:53 Problems: 1) I believe the Sechin Report was verified, especially by his own testimony, 2) the reference to the article was simpy for the sake of illuminating his reaction, and 3) they're going to subpoena the shit out of everything he did for months on end.
9136 2018-10-16 02:41:36 please post up those receipts of Simpson pleading the 5th, I haven't see that yet. Thanks. (Reliable sources only, please, thanks.)

9169 2018-10-16 02:37:22 Do not trust these paid media. As #bitcoin & #crypto #crypto are based on P2P nobody can prove what u holding. Don't hold your crypto on exchanges, u will be fine. No body can stop this revolution. Sooner or later India has to accept it.
9170 2018-10-16 02:37:04 If you were around for crypto all of 2017, you could just feel the growth from beginning to end of the year. All the way up to when Bitcoin hit 6700 and corrected back down to 6300 was healthy growth. After that it went crazy and crashed back down. And here we are. It's time.

9175 2018-10-16 02:35:47 Ethereum is a scam promoted by premine bag holders. It doesn't scale. The blockchain is over 1TB & younger than other blockchains. Full nodes have sync problems. It's broken. Crypto kitties took down the network. It's centralized. They've already reversed their recorded history.

9183 2018-10-16 02:33:56 Correct. Didn’t want to miss it in case there was no retest.
9184 2018-10-16 02:33:50 There is little doubt about that
9185 2018-10-16 02:33:47 As a truly competent person in crypto for a long period of time, I can sincerely say that this ICO-project is so hopeful. This is, certainly, what the market has been looking for. #ubecoin #UBEICO #ubecoinICO

9198 2018-10-16 02:33:04 Congrats to @koreanjewcrypto on the 1 year anniversary of the Dojo! Amazing group and I am so proud to be a part of it as a contributor.
9199 2018-10-16 02:32:57 It says “in 2018” that may be the case while they extend testing. A date hasn’t been determined. Early 2019 seems like a prudent call.
9200 2018-10-16 02:32:40 Hell, you haven't even read the Carter Page FISA, otherwise you'd know the FBI didn't use the Steele Dossier to grant the request.

The fact that the Steele Dossier agrees with a lot of the same reasons for the FBI investifation is, honestly, pretty fucking bad for Trump.
9201 2018-10-16 02:32:33 Its going down at WCC! lol
9202 2018-10-16 02:32:23 I'm sure if you tried any other way that's not crypto or cash you'd lose half of it in fees and it'd take months
9203 2018-10-16 02:32:19 Let’s try this the other way around. What leads you to believe a legislator is qualified when they don’t seem to understand the basics of PKI? That’s very specific. Private keys are not easy to steal. That’s one of the main attributes of #crypto she is dead wrong about. Very sad!
9204 2018-10-16 02:31:55 That is a milesstone, and us in the crypto -community know very well, congrts budd!!!!!
9205 2018-10-16 02:31:49 I hope you like it 
9206 2018-10-16 02:31:45 When you think “Russia” in terms of the collusion story you can’t go a second without the name Carter Page. You think he is able to get any information from anyone in that capacity??
9207 2018-10-16 02:31:43 yo crypto friends what you being for halloween?
 I already know my custome. Every year I go as a different central bank. This year im going as @WellsFargo and im going to open tabs in your name at the bar without permission LMAO

9239 2018-10-16 02:26:52 Start with crypto is not easy to steal. Quite the opposite. That’s flat out untrue & demonstrates poor understanding of PKI.

9254 2018-10-16 02:24:35 Possible reasons Fidelity wants to offer crypto products: 1. Their customers have been asking about it. 2. Defensive move against new players like Robinhood. 3. Lots of mainstream folks find most wallets/exchanges too hard to use.  4. Investments from retirement accounts.

9351 2018-10-16 02:07:27 And this is crypto twitter, and you make crypto content, and alts boomed af early 2018 so i dont think its far fetched at all to link it to money :)

9465 2018-10-16 01:44:26 Fake new floating around about USDT (Tether) from an email floating around saying Binance will Delist Tether (Not True) caused a sell off and consequently a rise in other crypto assets.

9467 2018-10-16 01:43:45 Just to be the Devil's Advocate, be careful with all these "bullish signs" Crypto is famous for doing the exact opposite of what everyone believes to be it's next move, don't over expose yourself after surviving this long....

9484 2018-10-16 01:40:00 Scarcity is the key IMO. Bitcoin having a finite amount and block mining rewards getting smaller every 4 yrs, psychologically it has to go up. to me it’s not a matter of if but a matter of when. This will suck up all the fiat eventually

9500 2018-10-16 01:36:54 Tether has been a burial ground for crypto money for sometimes. It is high that Tether closed people, so money from actually coin actually get swapped with another coin instead of being swallowed by USDT. I hope every dollar in it is moved out to stimulate the market...right time

9593 2018-10-16 01:21:26 P.s what if u have a learning disability, is it harder to grasp or is it for “dummies” too? Lol
9594 2018-10-16 01:21:14 Yeah binance is a good coin because it is backed by their crypto exchange. I'm holding some now.
9595 2018-10-16 01:21:08 Yeah I saw that... anticipating a move very soon
9596 2018-10-16 01:20:53 Pretty interesting, brother. Unless there's a massive surprise coming...the fundamentals are quite sound. $NVDA's Q2 EPS was up almost 100% from year ago period. Revenue growth ~40%, and most of the crypto BS was already addressed. I don't have a position, but I like the numbers.

9607 2018-10-16 01:19:46 For instance I was in the other day at 9850 sats and then the whole tether blow up yesterday stopped me out. Then it pumped a bit overnight before I got back in.

9634 2018-10-16 01:15:10 Who?  Me?  Obviously not.  I just don't think massive voices should be discounted on this issue.  Tapper brought in massive people to speak to the issue and a post mocked him.  It was top that which I was responding.
9635 2018-10-16 01:15:07 Usually it's a matter of priorities. I was told recently "I can't afford to buy crypto, I don't have the extra cash", yet this person spends at minimum $50 a week on cigarettes.

9705 2018-10-16 01:05:20 Makes sense
9706 2018-10-16 01:05:17 This is reassuring. These guys are very interested in crypto and recognize it is something they NEED to be in. They'll get there, it's just on the slow boat... because they're cautious. Great video - thanks Rippening

9734 2018-10-16 01:02:01 Satan is @BullyEsq’s alt account, my exact thoughts reading that tweet this am
9735 2018-10-16 01:01:59 Its usd vs usdt.. 
Fiat currency vs stable coin tether.. 

People stopped trusting tether, and are moving to other stable coins.. and to do that, they have to buy btc.   Thats why the price is 300 usd higher for usdt marker.. 

Coinbase has usd markets. And binance has usdt.
9736 2018-10-16 01:01:59 I've been moving from my comfort zone since joining the crypto community. Take risk, DYOR, believe in your projects and learn patience. Learn to accept losses and take profit, to reinvest and pay your taxes.

9804 2018-10-16 00:52:13 People often say to be a good trader you need to be accurate with your TA and understand FA.

Although this is very true, it still only resembles 50% of your toolbox.

The other 50% is having the awareness to pull the trigger on the right opportunities. #tradermantra #execute

9809 2018-10-16 00:51:43 Pretty simple. Doesn’t matter if she’s Republican or Democrat. She did an awful thing. This is why she has talked about it. She also published a Native American cook book that she plagiarized. Research my dude. Research. She’s a typical politician. Shameful in every way.

9817 2018-10-16 00:50:10 Nope.. not at all. She used her BS “Native American status” to gain preferential treatment at an Ivy League school. Therefore basically stealing that position from an actual Legitimate Native American.She stood on the graves and shoulders of an oppressed group for her own benefit
9818 2018-10-16 00:49:50 The God I believe does occupy space and didn't create the universe out of nothing.

I view God as an elevated and benevolent carpentar (not a reference to Jesus Christ) who created much out of raw materials.

9820 2018-10-16 00:49:18 Its going to add to sell pressure when ppl spend their crypto, good for spreading awareness but not good for the coin market price. It is just a tool to make the card seller rich.  People should buy back the amount of crypto they spend.

9942 2018-10-16 00:32:47 Over caffeination lets you see into the future
9943 2018-10-16 00:32:43 Reminder that Bitcoin has $13,000,000/day of sell pressure from mining. Ethereum has $4,000,000/day. Crooks and idiots will tell you that 17,000,000 new dollars are entering crypto every day,even today. You gotta be crazy to believe that. Market manipulation is keeping prices up.

9954 2018-10-16 00:31:12 Just imagine, for argument sake, what if the entire crypto market DID crash, along with USDT simulataneously, and just for shits and giggles, the dollar as well. I mean, every other countries fiat is crashing. That would be a rather intelligent trap, no? Not likely, but possible

9976 2018-10-16 00:27:19 #bitcoin has already dipped 70%. Sure, it could drop to $3000 or $2000 (long the fck out of it at such point) but I’d rather short old centralized tech at all times highs (Amazon or Facebook) than bitcoin down low at $6000. 

$crypto is the future.

9986 2018-10-16 00:25:53 Sorry - I'm not trying to project hate. It was just disappointing seeing that come in the day after I shouted you out.

The paid group model isn't inherently wrong, and I don't think you deserve legitimate hate, but the timing there really made me wrinkle my nose.
9987 2018-10-16 00:25:36 I really like neo and where the price is at and with ontology seems to be a solid crypto play too.
9988 2018-10-16 00:25:29 I think the reason why Fidelity, Bakkt and etc are launching crypto products for institutions very soon is because they know the global market could crash soon and $BTC could be a hedge.
