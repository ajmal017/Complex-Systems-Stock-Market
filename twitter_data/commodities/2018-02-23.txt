18 2018-02-25 21:40:31 I think African governments must treat certain commodities as strategic and insist on adding value before such products are exported.

They'll create jobs and boost their coffers at the same time. The over $500bn Africa spends on food imports could be better spent locally.

59 2018-02-25 19:20:18 almost all the labour involved in producing slave-commodities in slave-markets was violence per se (seizing, beating, chaining, branding, raping) and transporting; this was the labour expenditure that determined the market values of the enslaved.

61 2018-02-25 19:08:41 I think samsung screens are more expensive generally because they make a wide range of phones and the S series isn't really popular in these parts so they don't import them much. Scarce commodities are expensive.
62 2018-02-25 19:00:19 For me it is. I don’t know how else to invest in commodities.  Equities and bonds aren’t interesting to me these days.

69 2018-02-25 18:25:45 Wow. You are hyper focused on sex --and on women-- as commodities.  That attitude right there is why you don't get any.

Do you have a CLUE how many times in her life a woman is told by random male strangers that she needs to smile more? We are taught to smile by default.
70 2018-02-25 18:21:35 No, money is not food, water, shelter, etc. That is your claim but that is not a fact.  You want to shift them into a group called "commodities" to sell rather than resources to live by.  I will not agree on that.  You have not made your argument even realistic.

74 2018-02-25 18:01:07 He’s also cheap, scored a bunch in the minors, and never really got a chance in Nashville because of their immense depth. So I think he kind of counts as a prospect who’s ready to make the leap up. Chia also basically said he wanted to trade for known commodities- not draft picks
75 2018-02-25 17:45:35 Demand and supply are not the only fsctors at play here. Advertisements shape our opinion, which influences demand for these commodities. However, it's true that only those buy these products, who have money to buy them.
76 2018-02-25 17:34:09 I’d like to say he’s not representative of all men, but it seems like it’s far easier and forgivable for men to treat women as commodities and really this needs to end for the sake of all! He basically called you his accessory and that’s not okay!

78 2018-02-25 17:09:32 I don't think it's healthy to think of every woman as a possible SW you could maybe pay to be with honestly because it's somewhat viewing women like commodities to pay for in general.  I suppose I don't blame you for feeling that way though.

87 2018-02-25 16:18:25 I’ve noticed macro, gold, commodities traders really have a hard time with the stock market, constantly arguing with it. People always trying to understand why prices move or why prices should move are really going to struggle to make money.
88 2018-02-25 16:13:47 I and many learned know that you do understand the actually concept of GST. In a country like India which has extremely diverse economic sections and unequal financial states, one slab of tax for 90% of commodities is just not possible.

101 2018-02-25 14:46:13 Ergo, the problem is turning universities into  "market commodities" and students into a revenue stream for the rich, rather than places of learning. 

Expanding the sector to stuff with greater numbers of students who will take out student loans & load them with 30 years debt.

105 2018-02-25 14:24:18 Fuel prices at $1.38 (Total), after the reduction. Fuel prices have not yet been reduced. Prices of commodities are still high. I'm yet to see an actual conviction on corruption. Banks don't have cash, I still see old men and women sleeping outside banks. Need more time?

112 2018-02-25 13:24:16 I understand Burma's supposedly unique geography is a recurrent theme in your works. But how realistic is it? Major export commodities are natural resources. I don't see the working class benefitting anything out of it.

122 2018-02-25 11:30:16 Whether you put currency on the blockchain, such as gold or silver, commodities, such as petrol or food, the rules are the same. No one wants waste, and that's why corporations are taking notice because they can gauge their supply levels by real consumer demand for products.

124 2018-02-25 11:12:32 Dear @NCAA, if the players are truly “student-athletes” then treat them as such and stop profiting off of their talents and exploiting them as free labor commodities.
125 2018-02-25 11:11:54 But food and other commodities have been increasing unabated in the recent past, this is is just too much noise for nothing really.
126 2018-02-25 11:02:00 You said give him a chance in 100 days it will be alright and we give him a chance and all we got are dead civilians in the hands of the police and a  deadwood cabinet with arrogant Obert, double basic commodities prices and dishonest state media
127 2018-02-25 10:56:00 Lets not forget real economic factors that affect forex earnings. During the GNU the commodities cycle was at it's pick with platinum prices reaching over $1800. They started to go down in 2013 with platinum prices falling to even below $800. This what many politicians don't see
128 2018-02-25 10:52:47 Drugs do not relax you, they turn you into a consumptive addict who relies on commodities to remain socially functional.
129 2018-02-25 10:50:00 Retailers markup commodities by some ridiculous margin, then offer negligible "discounts" only redeemable within limited periods, and assume consumers will fall for the ploy and remain loyal to them. Consumers are rational for a reason, you dunce!
130 2018-02-25 10:29:01 Nigerians dream and fantasize the past. Their preference for the old is legendary. From commodities to wears, cars, then we prefer old professionals, and politicians to their younger mates. 
The mindset that glorifies the past is working against Fela Durotoye.

137 2018-02-25 09:08:35 We are beimg informed. Because price of commodities are rising beyond inflation. Maybe because of political interference or a few anto social activities by businessmen. But we are constantly reminded

159 2018-02-25 02:52:57 We should wait and watch our nation being robed completely because ultimately losses to government and banks will be recovered from the pockets of poor common people ,farmers ,middle class peoples by imposing high rate of taxes and increasing prices of all essential commodities.
160 2018-02-25 02:28:00 Economics is not a science. It is systems, and systems can adapt and evolve. Scarcity is relevant with regards to specific commodities, but no economy is a zero-sum game. Value is created all the time in the form of new products, technologies, services, art... Infinite potential.
161 2018-02-25 02:25:18 I would hope that if they do trade Karlsson it’s for more proven commodities but that likely won’t happen until the summer

166 2018-02-25 01:14:38 Please sir, reconsider this incorrect evaluation. It took so long last time because people were gox'd. We are not trading Dino paced commodities that take years to play out. The dumb money will forget and then bitcorn will pump harder than ever
167 2018-02-25 01:03:50 Glad I’m not the only one to think that. Looking at some of the other QB deals handed out recently I was expecting far more & for his deal to continue raising the bar for for even more unproven commodities (McCarron specifically)
168 2018-02-25 01:02:36 this increase on fees would hit hard on contractual workers, since they are required to renew their documents every renewal of their contract. and mind you, these are the same people most affected by

175 2018-02-25 00:00:57 You mean via inflation? Currency manipulation gets circumvented. With the US, we exported inflation after the QE series, and this caused the Arab Spring via foreign commodities markets imploding. China exports inflation to the ASEAN bloc, but then provides commodities as aid.

Comparing crypto market caps to fiat currency and commodities make crypto look EXTREMELY UNDERVALUED.

Because that's the correct relative valuation.
245 2018-02-24 17:02:53 I think the framing and insinuation is completely wrong.

If you compare crypto to companies they look overvalued. If you compare crypto to fiat currencies or commodities (the correct relative valuation), they look extremely undervalued.

375 2018-02-24 00:30:54 They're not ignorant. They have a weak union and unscrupulous owners who don't see them as people, but as commodities. Stop it.
376 2018-02-24 00:23:00 Peace is one of the most precious commodities of our day. If peace could be purchased at Rite Aid as an over the counter supplement, “big pharma” companies would lose billions! #FILLEDwithPeace #GateWayCityChurch

417 2018-02-23 21:01:29 Proven commodities so yes. I have a laundry list of guys we’ve drafted that didn’t pan out and were taken very high. These guys are in their prime so it’s not like we dealt for some 32 year olds. How many 2x Pro Bowlers are 25 and under?
418 2018-02-23 20:52:18 I'll continue the conversation here to make things less disorderly:

Anyway, while the workers do agree with the owner that the commodities aren't their property after their production, the issue I have is that many workers are forced into this situation by virtue - -
419 2018-02-23 20:51:41 Why not? People are considered commodities by the USA & we’re all traumatized in some capacity. Seems like a perfectly fitting synonym for a perhaps more appropriate label, if anything.
420 2018-02-23 20:50:36 Definitely. Those last two are still relatively unknown commodities, but I'm hopeful.
421 2018-02-23 20:49:02 Ah, but your labour did produce those commodities. Workers agreed, entered a contract, to work with YOUR means of production YOU either got or made, and the contract states that the workers do not own the commodities they make.
422 2018-02-23 20:44:12 Extracting profit over commodities my labour didn't produce?
423 2018-02-23 20:39:53 #Commodities | Most investors are underweighted or completely not invested in commodities because they've been so quiet, so sleepy. Commodities is my choice investment for investors to get diversified at low prices now. @TruthGundlach #OOTT #OATT

425 2018-02-23 20:28:49 Wayne LaPierre is a despicable pig. His blood money is allowing the carnage to continue to happen.

433 2018-02-23 19:50:15 Hypergamy cannot afford to bet a woman's reproductive future on a man's speculative performance. Hypergamy is nothing if not pragmatic and it takes men much longer than women to mature and establish themselves, thus, women prefer older men who've proven themselves as commodities.

444 2018-02-23 19:02:06 I'd add it is also the latest chapter in the history of general mills overpaying to "go organic" and slowly strangling the businesses by making them overprocessed, Big Food commodities, thus necessitating another overpriced organic acquisition.

450 2018-02-23 18:48:28 It all depends on how you define manufacturing activities. The volume of manufacturing exports has been rising steadily over time in many African countries.

455 2018-02-23 18:25:38 I would argue that it is the downstream industry - and ultimately the consumer - which reduces cows to commodities rather than the farmer. To the farmer cows are absolutely individuals, often called by name, even on relatively large farms.

483 2018-02-23 17:21:39 BBL Commodities expects oil to reach $80/barrel due to lower than expected inventories. On 1/13/15 we wrote "there has been an enormous shift in the pricing structure of oil from $90 to $60 & that $90 was the top of the new range, $60 was fair value, & $35/30 was the  lower end"
484 2018-02-23 17:17:53 They insist on having One World Government, that is what comes down to, the ownership of commodities, and the one issues, they think is to many people in the world, there will not be enough food for everyone, a war kills millions and help corporations, so lets wait for it.
485 2018-02-23 17:15:29 Yes , So petrol become 80 rs, price of essential commodities increased touching to sky, unemployment increased. Looters looting public money and due to best logistic provided by BJP, AND LEFT Country.

495 2018-02-23 16:40:08 Works towards building society according to ability. That according to Marx's definition means there are no longer commodities but still includes production of things for other consumption  which fits contemporary definition of commodities
496 2018-02-23 16:34:19 I think the point is that commodities gain their value from scarcity, which is not true of education.

También destacar que mientras Japón, Corea, Taiwán y China se han movido gradualmente hacia la producción de commodities con valor agregado basándose en un rol fuerte del gobierno, América Latina y su neoliberalismo han sido testigos pasivos del proceso.

501 2018-02-23 16:21:27 Gee, it seemed like Fed freed up investable funds to go into riskier investments...stocks, commodities, etc. As noted, every hint of a pullback of QE sent Treasuries higher.

507 2018-02-23 15:48:22 That's fine, but our long-term tests don't include TIPs prior to 1997. The availability of TIPs would substantially alleviate the burden on commodities and gold, and I would argue would shift the attractiveness of RP vs. 90/60 even further in RP's favour...
508 2018-02-23 15:46:48 Agree, but we’re also using asset classes that were basically uninvestible... once they became investable (commodities) through financialization, return profiles have shifted dramatically
509 2018-02-23 15:42:29 I’m broadly in your camp... the WF thing has nothing to do with the allocation, just how it’s being implemented.

For risk parity, the potential data mining is bonds / commodities have historically had > Sharpe ratio + better diversification benefits than can be expected forward

519 2018-02-23 15:13:11 Prof Ole... as long as we consider water as a commodity and not as a utility we shall never solve water issues. Commodities must be disbursed at a profit. So is going to supply FREE water? Even just fetching and suppling it costs money in a capitalistic system.

606 2018-02-23 05:55:15 It's released as a product because it has to be. Games are commodities because they're in a capitalist system. But making games to maximise corporate profit and advertising revenue is not the same thing as responsible game making, to edit a quote from that same Le Guin speech
607 2018-02-23 05:49:15 Right now, we need writers who know the difference between production of a market commodity and the practice of an art...Books aren’t just commodities; the profit motive is often in conflict with the aims of art. - Ursula K Le Guin

It's about books but it's still relevant imo
608 2018-02-23 05:41:11 Gold, like Bitcoin, is fully at the mercy of market forces, which unlike other asset classes, including many Commodities ( which have practical uses, Gold has none), sees no mean reversion.  USD is, if nothing else, a Standard of Deferred Payment, which gives it utility
609 2018-02-23 05:37:28 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.

611 2018-02-23 05:22:15 U said it. Metals and commodities in general...but there are always risks ...commodity prices risk is one...and lack of performance on the part of the exporter

619 2018-02-23 04:47:29 Believe me 10y try will hit 4% this year based on losing value of USD, excess of debt, high levels of deficits and high inflation due to higher prices of commodities.
620 2018-02-23 04:46:12 They may fill our roads at night but we love their commodities this is their daily hustle let's support them

622 2018-02-23 04:36:40 Government sponsors firearm commodities arbitrarily used irrelevant of school massacre. It is about nations gross national product 30% of smuggled firearms. Trump publicly changes statements on approval for teachers  to port firearm we don’t live in the Middle East ISIS
623 2018-02-23 04:15:31 50/50 commodities/crypto is correct.
624 2018-02-23 04:04:42 He said Commodities/Crypto so made an assumption 50/50 and while aggressive, in 20’s could make case that proper allocation ... I am lower and recommend lower for clients today. But doing lots of work and my number keeps rising... 
625 2018-02-23 03:57:36 This is also extremely bullish for commodities. Outside Investors are going to be hesitant to pump money into mining for a while with the threat of the government taking control, so we may see even more supply come offline as South Africa goes through this process
626 2018-02-23 03:52:59 #HawkersBillKE
However much you sanitize Hawking, they make our dirty and impassable especially in run-hours. For they can have a specific area within then the city where we can get their commodities.
627 2018-02-23 03:34:36 Después de ver la marcha de ayer, el aumento del gasto público, la inflación, la suba de commodities incesante y ahora esto de Rafecas, parece que no gobernara nadie 
628 2018-02-23 03:29:24 China has monster surplus via exports, and if they can fool anyone in taking yuan for commodities, continue to out play geopolitics they will try and pull it all off, but if the wheels come off before they bridge the gap. It'll become clear who wins the reverse beauty contest.

Dumbed Allow Business to run amuck inside Gov't, treating everyone & everything like their commodities.
630 2018-02-23 03:26:42 Hell, they tested it on poor folks in the late 1960s. It was called “commodities” & included canned pork & chicken, powdered milk, & gov’ment cheese. I know, cause we got it.

632 2018-02-23 03:24:56 I think it’s quite ubiquitous . I’ve had many comments over the years “ well I pay you so ...xyz” , grafted this is a minority but the thought does exist out there that we are nothing more than commodities owned by the public .

635 2018-02-23 03:19:22 33% passive equity (retirement ~ 25 yrs)
33% cash
33% commodities/crypto 

How would you rebalance?
636 2018-02-23 03:19:02 There's some screengrab from Fox where some richass says America has no poverty because 80% people have a fridge and a microwave. Its bonkers. We've made commodities cheap and usually that sort of thing comes with the room but food and lodging is still a majority of our income.
637 2018-02-23 03:18:57 It wasn't a big deal when demand was low in 2015-2016 (IMO mostly related to the commodities crash and when China showed signs of slowing down), but things got tighter throughout 2017. When ELD went into effect, supply definitely become unable to meet demand. 2/

639 2018-02-23 03:00:02 #Gold and #silver, like other #commodities, have an intrinsic value, which is not arbitrary, but is dependent on their scarcity.
640 2018-02-23 02:58:14 Pegou um Brasil melhor que seus antecessores pegaram, estabilizado pelo Plano Real, sem inflação galopante, tinha apoio pra fazer reformas, foi agraciado com o bum das commodities, mas em vez de estruturar o país, preferiu estruturar o plano de poder do PT. Um marginal.
641 2018-02-23 02:45:19 Muy teórico. En el caso de los commodities agrícolas no depende de un error en el dimensionamiento de la estructura de producción, sino que mayormente la oferta depende del clima, plagas, etc
Luego, si la demanda tracciona o está insatisfecha se parece mucho al huevo y la gallina
642 2018-02-23 02:42:40 Me diga você. O que o Lula fez com os bilhões das commodities que choveram no Brasil no primeiro mandato dele? Que reformas estruturais? Modernizou a industria brasileira? Deixou o país competitivo? Ou o grande feito foi dar crédito fácil pra todo mundo que não podia pagar?

645 2018-02-23 02:30:48 I expect to see more of this as white box mentality takes hold, even in the RAN. A trusted partner ecosystem is about to become commodities market. A thorough upending.

649 2018-02-23 02:16:39 I'm in a good mood tonight, so I'd like to remind you all that equities analysts are punk ass bitches and commodities people are fucking queens
650 2018-02-23 02:15:07 In my commodities class we are talking about wine. Now I want to buy a bottle, get wine drunk and watch a movie.
651 2018-02-23 02:15:00 Commodity production simultaneously outputs alienation and commodities which falsely promise to be the cure for the alienation
652 2018-02-23 02:14:23 That's how i would buy a man like a car. Kick those tires good too, test springs, crawl under looking for leaks, everything! lol

Is that what men prefer? To be treated like an object? To be commodities, and capitalized? Treated as women so often are, was my point.
653 2018-02-23 01:46:34 Was watching a doc today on the art world. Holy shit was it depressing.  Fucking hollow artists embracing their works as commodities of the elites
654 2018-02-23 01:45:55 Commodities a good risk based place to hide for now
655 2018-02-23 01:44:04 I have grown a love and appreciation for commodities in the meantime $NG is my new soulmate
656 2018-02-23 01:38:15 Still bullish commodities??
657 2018-02-23 01:34:43 Drugs muddle up your self-understanding, you become a mushroom suckling on capitalist commodities.
658 2018-02-23 01:23:38 Nor any living species. Just commodities to be exploited
659 2018-02-23 01:18:44 Inflation printing up globally and commodities still hugely far from its all time high. CBs behind the curve, but soon they will be obligated to raise rates agressively, but now, debt is much higher! Debt service are gonna explode, and there isn’t enough growth to pay that bill!
660 2018-02-23 01:18:40 So you’re totally fine with armed guards guarding banks and grocery stores...but not in our schools where our most precious commodities are kept??? Who’s really the dummy???
661 2018-02-23 01:05:48 It is good sign for Australian dollars will go up first , Australian dollars support with higher commodities price and higher growth in Australia and all our trader partners second USA dollars should go down because the higher deficit, third China story support ozzy $ .
662 2018-02-23 00:58:02 Please concentrate on middle class family no way of getting any benefits from state government or central government. Eg. EPF interest rate reduced, On Income tax not much relaxed, petrol /diesel price not coming down, cost on commodities increased. Hope for your concerned.
663 2018-02-23 00:57:53 Scotland - we're so fed up with our currency being questioned, we've resorted to using all manner of curious commodities to purchase provisions.  Could send you a few hundredweight of gravel chips till payday if you're a bit short.
664 2018-02-23 00:55:53 @ChrisMurphyCT .@CNN We shouldn't allow Business to run amuck inside our Government, treating everyone & everything like their commodities.
665 2018-02-23 00:54:51 I get where you are coming from and also held that position. But it's also not fair to waste tax payer dollars towards someone who will be living years in prison receiving resources, mental help aid, or any commodities
