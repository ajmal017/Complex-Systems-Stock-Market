1 2019-06-15 23:50:45 Its good that you have stocks and real estate, this is a good balance. Why would anyone want to own bonds? You're correct to avoid what is return free risk. You'd better get up to speed on gold & silver lest you pay a severe price for not understanding the best asset classes now.
2 2019-06-15 23:50:21 Instead of throwing millions of dollars at Elon musk!  Why not take part of his company so that the companies sales and stocks enrich the people?

4 2019-06-15 23:48:58 nobody recommends buy and hold stocks, only broad based low turnover portfolios called indexes
5 2019-06-15 23:47:37 President Obama saved our economy & his Affordable Care Act saved my life, so NO. Because of Trump, my health insurance TRIPLED cost more than my mortgage, my stocks also lost over $35/share, so Trump is THE worst pres. to ever hold the office. We don’t want a racist in the WH!
6 2019-06-15 23:46:58 He is a dick! Mainly because the first time I fought him, he surprised me breaking out of the stocks, then grabbed me and threw me over the cliff — full death in 20 seconds e.e
7 2019-06-15 23:46:50 Possible scenario is fed holds with “patient” language, stocks tank and gold rips since July is the dangling carrot for rate cuts.
8 2019-06-15 23:46:00 Consequently, it is imperative to contribute a portion of your rewards to different ventures, for example, stocks, land, or even just in a bank.
9 2019-06-15 23:44:19 Now scale that up to the entire economy, boomers not buying stuff in huge quantities, selling their stocks and bonds, and see what happens to millennial aspirations
10 2019-06-15 23:43:50 You don’t always have to swing. Even if your throws got gutted, get your pummels on your grabs. If he’s expecting the bair, grab him and reset the situation. Getting impatient/rushing for stocks is how games are lost when you’re basically in complete control of a situation

AJ Stroup wins the heat race over Croop, Bachman, Schoch, and Kissinger.
12 2019-06-15 23:41:10 What about when stocks and real estate are tokenized?

14 2019-06-15 23:40:45 @realDonaldTrump long before you said it, I planned on selling off all my stocks if you did not win and the @TheDemocrats took over your office and the house in 2016. I benefited. It was never more true for 2020. #winYourRace2020! Or the country loses.
15 2019-06-15 23:40:14 Pro Stocks Heat 2 
start-Croop leads a 3 car battle for 2nd.
lap 1-Stroup emerges from the 3 wide battle for 2nd.
lap 2-Stroup leads Croop and Bachman.
lap 3-Bachman closes in on Croop for 2nd.
16 2019-06-15 23:39:40 Yeah agree with that

18 2019-06-15 23:37:20 You cannot judge the overall economy by how much the wealthy are making or how many own stocks.  The biggest portion of the population did not gain a lot of $$ (screwed by the tax plan).  How is that most wonderful health care that everyone would get coming?
19 2019-06-16 23:59:48 What stocks are you selling or buying?
20 2019-06-16 23:58:48 lol. I just ask if they have any other stocks they like, then I short those too.
21 2019-06-16 23:58:02 Just out there crushing it eh?  I love it.  Devour the gains!  Pot stocks will have their day again, cycles.
22 2019-06-16 23:57:54 Food for thought: the #dowjones may get modestly buoyed by an influx of capital if geopolitical risks - particularly those in Iran - continue to escalate and prompt investors to flock to defense stocks.

26 2019-06-16 23:52:48 Have huge respect for those who trade regularly on financial markets and consistently beat the market. Takes a huge amount of mental strength and endurance to do it, especially when stocks are volatile.
27 2019-06-16 23:52:23 Hahaha yes that’s where a lot of mine are . About 300 dollars deep right now in weed stocks . My Canada ones blew up when it went full rec out there
28 2019-06-16 23:51:41 A few years back i bought some penny stocks and i never checked on them. Im prolly a millionaire by now and i dont even know it
29 2019-06-16 23:50:43 Bro I know I try telling people to get pot stocks now while they’re low af.... after it’s legal everywhere it’s gonna be upwards of a 4500% increase in the industry and the stocks will be booming lol I have so many already
30 2019-06-16 23:50:38 Reason it hasn’t worked & likely won’t work is bc rising USD destroys capital.  If USD moves like Brent thinks it could, there will be no capital to move to US stocks.  it will be like what happens to a highly levered equity acct when stocks drop - equity capital goes to $0.
31 2019-06-16 23:50:17 Because it's not about the stocks or the suppressors. It's about setting a precedent for infringement. Right now, it's "Oh, who needs bumpstocks/suppressors?" Next it'll be "Who needs more than ten rounds?" or "Nobody REALLY needs semiautomatic!" And he flat-out LIED.
32 2019-06-16 23:49:50 Hard to say and that includes dovish preparation for July. 10-year doing lots of cutting for them and stocks are riding high so why not take a free pass. They can always come in if trump fails to deliver a trade deal w China.
33 2019-06-16 23:49:25 Being really long maxed out of leverage all the big biotech and pharma stocks the day before Trump won. I sold them all the day after the election right into massive strength. In hindsight it was a gamble but there was blood in the water when I got long those names
34 2019-06-16 23:49:11 Diversity diversity diversity. There’s a lot more to the market than pot stocks. There’s a lot more to trading than buying and holding. I’ve gotten serious lately about options and they’ve paid handsomely. I admit potstock got me into the markets but I haven’t owned one in months

37 2019-06-16 23:45:20 "To me last few weeks seems stocks & gold trading like they expect a dovish Fed next week that basically promises a rate cut in July."

40 2019-06-14 23:55:37 When the investors learn that the other reason it was delayed to March was to coincide with the release of the Switch Mini, the stocks will go back up.
41 2019-06-14 23:55:11 Ran out of space.  Gold, oil, land, bitcoin, guns, food...tangible assets.  Big recession coming and this time it will be a Bail-in for the banks not a bail-out.  I have a few oil stocks...trust me I’m on board with oil.
42 2019-06-14 23:55:03 The only problem is if you trade the stocks in for other stocks and buy and sell frequent you have to pay extra to have your taxes done at least on turbotax or taxact. I used stash for a while. Made like $140 but had to pay $100 to file the earnings to IRS

47 2019-06-14 23:46:58 Not just for getting stocks, but just movements in general
48 2019-06-14 23:46:18 One reason people don't buy stocks is they have no surplus income. Saying p should invest if they want more wealth strikes me as cold and blind. I say pay them more-- they clearly deserve it; and the vast fortunes made on their backs proves that point.

50 2019-06-14 23:43:27 I'd say we are a few weeks out. We are adding a brand new UI that I think everyone will like. I personally like it and I've traded FX, stocks, and options before crypto.
51 2019-06-14 23:42:55 I could name quite a few 2 cent stocks I bought that went up 40 x, then I sold. I had no belief in the companies long term but my market sense was that investors would buy those stocks one day. They did. For awhile there you could buy any penny and make out fine. Just had to sell
52 2019-06-14 23:42:23 I think he wants us to buy pot stocks #ChipsWithTheDip #chipswithdip #Raptors #NBAChampions2019
53 2019-06-14 23:40:46 Holy fuck..My stocks dropped so much since April.  That orange clown needs to keep his fucking yap shut.
54 2019-06-14 23:39:44 @givemeabreak @MOonBUYS Same reason why stocks within certain sectors run together. They're fundamentally similar.
55 2019-06-14 23:39:06 If people want to share in the profits, they're free to buy stock.

Normal Americans don't buy stocks because they think they're "too risky" and they don't understand how valuable they are over the long-run.  

This is a norm that we must change; people should want to buy stocks.
