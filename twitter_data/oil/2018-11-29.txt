41 2018-11-29 23:56:58 Apply almond oil around the mouth to keep your lips supple and soften the lines.
42 2018-11-29 23:56:58 Lets see oil has fallen below $50 a barrel, its Winter so less demand for gas but sure lets say it's all Doug Ford.
43 2018-11-29 23:56:54 It might be an exhaust brake. (a valve closes within the exhaust causing backpressure, instead of the regular engine brake that holds the exhaust valves open via oil pressure)
44 2018-11-29 23:56:52 There’s never been a US president that was more of an enemy to the oil & gas industry than Obama.  He single handedly bankrupted the coal industry, opposed pipelines, supported regs making it harder to develop new reserves.  Plus the Solyndra disaster, costing taxpayers $535 M.
45 2018-11-29 23:56:50 The truth is sadam was giving oil to the Russian (back door) it gave the United states a way into the Middle East forever.  We now control all of Iraq oil plus Saudi and Kuwait next step is Africa, already in the works!

50 2018-11-29 23:56:24 Lmao i do mine after 15! Synthetic oil brooo
51 2018-11-29 23:56:20 We need refineries...Why not have more refineries to store oil and sell as required?
52 2018-11-29 23:56:18 I been seeing a lot of people complain about how expensive it is to get your oil changed. I thought that was something you could do yourself? I could’ve sworn we learned that in driver’s ed?

63 2018-11-29 23:55:19 PM @JustinTrudeau, how much will it cost #Canadians to build/install pipelines of potable water to areas across #Canada (First Nations Reserves) without drinkable water compared to the #TransMountain oil pipeline that sources other countries?

Water is life- oil is oil…

64 2018-11-29 23:55:17 Leaders may be happy the price of oil for their citizens is low, but Saudi Arabia's human rights abuses should sour them.  Overall, dealing with MBS is like dealing with the devil (and he's not the only devil there).
65 2018-11-29 23:55:09 It’s complicated due to common carrier status of oil pipelines. Govt owns the resource, so maybe newer projects that ramped up recently since they cannibalized conv heavy and light sweet exports which pay much higher royalties.

68 2018-11-29 23:54:59 Has anybody tried the cannabis oil treatment? It stops pain, the nausea and may help for symptoms. We are killing cancers and treatments for epilepsy and helps control blood sugars for type II diabetes. It's worth a shot. Cannabis is being legalized in alot of states now.

73 2018-11-29 23:54:23 The guy asks me what type of oil my car uses like, idk you’re the mechanic ?¿
74 2018-11-29 23:54:22 My car would hydroplane all the time living there when it would rain because of all the oil build up on the roads. It was terrifying. And that’s coming from a Seattle girl very well accustomed to rain.
75 2018-11-29 23:54:11 As long as you did have to change the oil in your pants- he did ok.
76 2018-11-29 23:54:00 With a building time is of the essence of a roof is beginning to leak or a scenario like that which makes it more in need of maintenance than an oil painting

111 2018-11-29 23:48:34 We stand at a precipice.  Oil is destroying the planet.  The government of the US, and most around the world, run on oil and get their money from oil.   the habitat collapses, but Wall Street needs just one more day of profits.   No alternatives are in place.

140 2018-11-29 23:45:38 Fat/carb ratio doesn’t seem to affect my body fat % as long as I eat enough protein, eat whole foods and avoid grains, veg oil, dairy, sugar and alcohol. I’m currently carnivore for other reasons.

143 2018-11-29 23:45:20 They are all snake oil salesmen. That's why I stick to cards
144 2018-11-29 23:45:17 Ahhh I’m so glad I went to a school that understands logic. That weird fucking FSU fan won’t leave my mentions until he sells me snake oil hand made by Taggart and calls it the formula for a national championship
145 2018-11-29 23:45:15 Oil at $100 barrel.
146 2018-11-29 23:45:14 Tinman: *creaky weak voice*

Dorothy: this smells like whiskey...
Tinman: JUST GIVE IT TO ME LADY......
147 2018-11-29 23:45:08 so honored @KissaSins wore my shoes in her oil scene! woot woott
148 2018-11-29 23:45:07 omg sugar cookie oil....yes please
149 2018-11-29 23:44:47 I mostly eat the kind of pb that you have to stir oil into, so I’m not used to seeing semisolid surfaces like the one in the first photo. But it is very calm, very even.
150 2018-11-29 23:44:41 Time to get this oil change

155 2018-11-29 23:44:23 おはよー！
156 2018-11-29 23:44:22 That’s cause you’re telling them lies and promising miracles when none are to be had. 

Neither Trudeau nor Notley have opposed oil production. In fact quite the opposite. Those lies, like the manufactured protests are thanks to CPC & UCP
157 2018-11-29 23:44:04 Matt can tell when oil needs changed by the smell but I can smell a diabetic foot wound  when I walk into their room so who is the real winner. We both are

159 2018-11-29 23:43:50 Cole was supposed to change my oil when i bought my car in September. my oil still hasn’t been changed.
160 2018-11-29 23:43:46 One off ice official and two in ice is unique indeed. I applaud the cost cutting as Albertan in the oil patch. Hockey is expensive and it’s nice to see steps taken to reduce costs.
161 2018-11-29 23:43:38 Believe state-run media, instead of looking at all the evidence, because big oil is still thirsty.
162 2018-11-29 23:43:38 Typically I just use salt and pepper for steaks. If your looking for something for the pan, how about grapeseed oil? It can withstand a high heat without going bad. Add some garlic if you are looking for flavor.

165 2018-11-29 23:43:25 canada could hit the saudis a lot harder by building a pipeline for domestic oil to the east coast and reducing saudi imports

We haven’t needed oil or gas since 1954 ... think about all of the deaths/suffering.
167 2018-11-29 23:43:17 Again with the gender thing? Do you realize Canada is heading for a economic downturn? G.M, Alberta oil, Doug Ford. and on top of that, Russia is using more aggression, England is in a crisis over Brexit, U.S is in a crisis, immigration crisis and you pick gender equality. WOW!

173 2018-11-29 23:42:34 omg guys i’m back with my family we just had dinner together and me my mum and my sisters just sat down talking for hours and my mum massaged our hair with coconut oil  i’m so happy to be back home

179 2018-11-29 23:41:53 We also subsidize big oil which doesn't need it & give tax breaks to big corps & the wealthiest which is yet another massive transfer of wealth to those that need it least. Yet, the middle class is disappearing & current wages have about the same buying power of wages 40 yrs ago.
180 2018-11-29 23:41:49 took a huge hit of an oil pen on accident at 1pm and i’m just now coming down after 6 hours
181 2018-11-29 23:41:40 Albertans working in oil need to start planning for the future. Oil is dead because if if it isn’t we all die. We need to stop wasting tax dollars on people who want to avoid the truth and invest in education and alternative energy sources.
182 2018-11-29 23:41:28 Why isn't pre-bottled gasoline a thing?
You can buy any other kind of fuel/oil product in automotive or hardware stores. 
183 2018-11-29 23:41:19 It had nothing to do with you. You did nothing to help the oil & gas industry. What a liar.

186 2018-11-29 23:41:11 I have neighbors who tried that. I found out which ones by putting cayenne pepper oil on the cover for the nozzles used to inflate/deflate the tires. The cussing shortly after the next time they let the air out of my tires was spectacular.

191 2018-11-29 23:40:47 Your “stop gap” measure is dangerous to the public and cost prohibitive, the whole point it to make our oil more profitable not less. Paying the railroads to make the oil trains a higher priority so that every trip is 24hrs not 48 would be a far better solution.

195 2018-11-29 23:40:07 I’ve learned that adding additional moisturizers to your routine with actually help with the oil. Because your face won’t try to make excessive oil trying to keep itself moisturized. I’ve added an hydraulic acid moisturizer and almond oil to my routine and have noticed a diff
196 2018-11-29 23:39:54 My oil change  in the 500 cost me nearly £200 which is around $350. Gearbox oil change is about $200

Oil and gas/Ship building/repair.
200 2018-11-29 23:39:29 I have to eat way less carbs. I can eat cereals or crackers for breakfast, no animal milk. For lunch, pasta, soup or cereals with simple vegetable sauces, raw Olive oil and parmesan. For dinner, i choose between meat, fish, cheese, eggs and I can eat either raw or cooked veggies.

202 2018-11-29 23:39:15 Do they still use the old oil for the fries?
203 2018-11-29 23:39:06 I bet he wasn't. That oil was comin out like expired milk 
204 2018-11-29 23:38:57 Getting the European countries (esp. Germany) weaned off Russian oil and gas would be an YUUUUGE blow to Putin.
205 2018-11-29 23:38:22 You have to admit because most of this new oil is the result of Fracking he could have screwed it up!
206 2018-11-29 23:38:18 I only say she's rich because of the Oil wealth associated with the land of the Karankawa in Texas. Also, the settler that raped her ancestor had a land grant for Padre Island as well as a Million+ acres in Texas & Mexico.

208 2018-11-29 23:38:08 Most of our oil is from our own country and we aren’t protecting our weapons. We are selling weapons
209 2018-11-29 23:38:04 @IcelandFoods will you consider changing your messaging around boycotting palm oil?

211 2018-11-29 23:37:56 And NBA players can go overseas. Stephon Marbury seemed to do just fine in the CBA.  

Also, I'm an Audi technician.  We aren't live techs changing oil.  Myself & my coworkers have a significant level of education, as well as tens of thousands of dollars invested in tools.
212 2018-11-29 23:37:55 Cuz loooook. My t-zone be wilding out. I’ve found doing a mask before my makeup sometimes helps with the excess oil. I’m definitely looking into it.
213 2018-11-29 23:37:53 Frying a turkey and the oil thermometer is broken, in case you don’t hear from me again. That’s why.

216 2018-11-29 23:37:47 The incentives have a problem here in MA too. There is no fuel-switching allowed.  So you can go from resistance electric to more-efficient heat pump, but not oil to heat pump (as I am going to do for my oil water heater).

219 2018-11-29 23:37:38 HA HA HA.  You mean give the wealthy tax cuts they dont need and allow them to hoard the benefit solely for themselves while you explode the deficit. Yeah trumponomics is as great as trump steaks or trump university. Youre a fraud, flim flam, snake oil salesman. Nothing more.
220 2018-11-29 23:37:36 And with continuing denial of the devastation to our planet by massive oil & gas pollution, with 7.5 BILLION HUMANS NOW, how are you going to work when you can't breath? Hope your children enjoy that.
221 2018-11-29 23:37:36 I guess I'm saying if the argument is their influence would be too big, that's an argument that can be made about several large corporations already, and not hypothetically, in at least oil, electric and tech just to name a few
222 2018-11-29 23:37:31 A makeup remover that has oil in it

240 2018-11-29 23:35:58 What would happen if Canada placed tariffs upon Saudi Oil (from an Econ perspective)?  Seems it would be two-for-two in making Canadian oil more marketable, and deliver the message to Saudi from a “sanctions” perspective.

243 2018-11-29 23:35:50 Let's see. Hillary voted YES to a war for oil. My husband was sent away for 18 months in said war. We had no medical benefits and during that time I ended up with cancer. No war with an exit plan, def no war without taking care of military families. Oh, & no primary RIGGING! wtf
244 2018-11-29 23:35:44 He is insane! Oil prices and production tanked during his administration. Economy was flat at best.
245 2018-11-29 23:35:40 The townspeople are wising up to the snake oil salesman.
246 2018-11-29 23:35:32 We declare peace , being alive is what counts   sell all commodities for cash. storage is a pain in the ass and expensive.  How do we store hundred trillion gallons of oil even if we found it?
247 2018-11-29 23:35:30 Good to hear, David.  Egg-whites from Costco, if possible, and cook them in olive oil.  Find creative ways to make chicken breasts palatable (try different Asian and Mexican hot sauces).  Low-carb and low-sugar protein bars will satiate sweet cravings.

259 2018-11-29 23:34:20 Very rarely and when it does not heavily.  Causes oil slicks.  Just wrecked this morning because I hit a oil slick and lost all traction and control. Only going 50 mph.
260 2018-11-29 23:34:15 You know they’re at optimal speed, heat and oil levels....
261 2018-11-29 23:34:13 Name one federal policy under Obama that helped our oil industry.  It was State fracking alone.

263 2018-11-29 23:33:52 Compliments on the eucalyptus oil diffusion today ^w^~ Meanwhile I heard wind of the two ladies on the other side who have had to implement other various solutions to deal with smoker's stank
264 2018-11-29 23:33:47 And then Obama attempted to claim credit for it! Same goes for our abundant oil supplies. President Trump's _real_ energy policy is good for America. Remember Obama's "energy policy"? He told us to put some air in our tires. Seriously_!!
265 2018-11-29 23:33:31 What kind of oil is in that device lol

267 2018-11-29 23:33:24 @WBrettWilson me and my 45 twitter followers are unlikely to make a difference... so I ask you can you and your thousands of twitter followers who see the benefits of ethical Cdn oil help make these hashtags trend. Consumer pwr is pwrful. #lushhatescanada #lushlovesmurderers
268 2018-11-29 23:32:57 @Lin_Manuel Get someone to get you Eucalyptus essential oil. Fill hotel sink with very hot water.  Put about 10 drops of the oil in.  Put towel over your head and sink. Breathe thru mouth. It will reduce inflammation in vocal chords
269 2018-11-29 23:32:48 Excellent sarcasm ... pretty sure you missed the point.  He is purporting to understand roster construction... if he did as well then as he appears to now, why would he predict a cup winner?  He’s good at telling you what happened after the fact and then assuming trend stays

271 2018-11-29 23:32:29 You should try taking cbd oil it helps with a lot of things. They sell it at some smoke shops.
272 2018-11-29 23:32:20 I like the sound of this independent coastal state. Look forward to this being applied to Scotland's oil #bbcqt
273 2018-11-29 23:32:19 I don’t understand people who say they can’t cook. Chop some vegetables, add olive oil, salt, pepper. Pop it in the oven. You just cooked!
274 2018-11-29 23:32:15 Oil and munitions....
275 2018-11-29 23:32:13 Lego is a petroleum Product? it is like all oil petroleum Products cancer inducing. Eat some more lego crap while your at it XD
276 2018-11-29 23:31:56 The SNP lied about oil revenues, currency unions, EU membership and more and in the 4+ years since the indyref more Scots have voted unionist than nationalist in every election.
277 2018-11-29 23:31:56 "Claire" has certainly opened my eyes to the medicinal properties from plants, as well.  All of my cosmetics, including my shampoo/conditioner, are essential oil. The parallels between the Highland culture and Native American Indians are incredible. Lots to learn from both!! 
278 2018-11-29 23:31:42 The motor oil thing messed me up 
279 2018-11-29 23:31:33 I see the future here: like the Canadian Wheat Board except for oil! Petroleum supply management.
280 2018-11-29 23:31:33 @PnPCBC Imagine for just a moment - if oil was discovered in Ontario. What kind of response wd we be watching now. Would it be (symbolic) empty platitudes, helpfully informing the ‘hardworking middle class families’ that it’s a crisis but our hands are tied? Montreal SAID no!

286 2018-11-29 23:30:51 #bbcqt you can always tell when the Tory's are up to their neck in it, like Zahawi, they scapegoat everybody for their FU & use patronising crap like for the good of nation !
Just like the snake oil pedlars they are !!!
287 2018-11-29 23:30:47 if oil companies just said: "look, we rule the world - so fuck you ." - it would at least be honest.

290 2018-11-29 23:30:16 Can't imagine all the guys I would trade this summer If I were the next Oilers GM. It would be so much fun to get rid of Nurse, Russell, Lucic, Kassian etc etc. Oil hould get the go-ahead from 97 to do a quick reload and in two seasons time, they would be ready; maybe even one yr
291 2018-11-29 23:30:13 Lucky  we gotta wait til the one Samoan store orders it unless someone comes from the islands with some haha never tried it with chilli oil tho.. I just sasa ma le mayonnaise 
292 2018-11-29 23:30:08 yeah well she makin shit with spices and love instead of palm oil and capitalism
293 2018-11-29 23:29:46 LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT HOW MUCH I LOVE FISH OIL
294 2018-11-29 23:29:40 Actually that's not true, the markets have only spoken about Canadian oil, not oil in general. The markets have said nothing about oil demand.
295 2018-11-29 23:29:38 So in other words, yes focusing on microbial methane (eg. enteric methane) is a huge distraction from the primary huge source of CH4 (ancient thermogenic CH4)  causing all the problems. George should get a stipend from British Oil & Gas for his efforts
296 2018-11-29 23:29:38 Clean coal has a place in our energy solution.  Your guy Obama has been bragging that our oil surplus is because of him...try that fantasy world view on for size...fracking proceeded inspite of O’s 8 years of energy obstructionism = no carbon sources.
297 2018-11-29 23:29:31 It’s almost 2019 how do you not know what CBD oil is?
298 2018-11-29 23:29:25 I have groundnut oil underneath my screen protector
299 2018-11-29 23:29:09 Brexit won't affect EEA trade as it's negligible. It's all deficit because it's fish and oil from Norway nothing more
300 2018-11-29 23:29:04 "rubbing some oil on your skin"???
301 2018-11-29 23:28:55 I just spent $82 on a cbd oil ahahhaha well fuq me
302 2018-11-29 23:28:48 Na real testimony. The two Darkness books were like someone poured hot oil on my brain. And the Mark of the Lion series was the first series book that.... I read like that. Yeah I really should buy them and read them again
303 2018-11-29 23:28:43 @lushcosmetics so you've taken an ideological dubious stance against ethical and Cdn oil and gas producers and sided with a  murderous theocratic #Saudi regime. Wise choice. I choose never to visit your stores again. #lushlovesmurderers #lushhatescanada
304 2018-11-29 23:28:42 Motor oil pancakes >>>>
305 2018-11-29 23:28:31 I care very much about scientific fact and evidence-based actions on climate. Which is why I listen to every reality-driven scientist on the planet;projections so far have underestimated the extent of our effect on the climate. Put that in your oil well and smoke it. Bye!
306 2018-11-29 23:28:24 Been taking some vitamins with fish oil in them and that shit is gross af
307 2018-11-29 23:28:19 Also, will this phlegm ever leave my throat or? I finally hit the apple cider vinegar shots. I’ve drank so many liquids I’m peeing clear and I’m oil of oregano’d out
308 2018-11-29 23:28:06 The only progressive thing our mayor ddid was come up with universal pre-K. That was truly a great idea. What are other boba fides? And suing oil companies doesn’t count.
309 2018-11-29 23:28:02 YESSSSS!!! Wahoo in chilli oil with rice is fucking bomb. I’ve been eating that the last couple days 
310 2018-11-29 23:27:51 No but sure as night follows day and day follows night he sure likes kissing up to people who murder for gas prices to go down but... who is that help him or us if he ends up getting them to mark prices of oil down and prices stay the same? Someone's winning with blood money
311 2018-11-29 23:27:25 I thought Alberta was oil territory.
312 2018-11-29 23:27:04 @realDonaldTrump
@KellyannePolls
@PressSec 

I'm REAL TIRED OF OBUMMER trying to take credit for economy and now oil production n gas...CALL HIM OUT
313 2018-11-29 23:26:59 ก็แค่จะเดินกลับไปฟังคำพูดเดิมๆ “กลับบ้านดีๆนะ” ถึงแล้วโทร/ไลน์มา” อุ๊ย ตีมือ อิอิ
314 2018-11-29 23:26:52 Oh so sorry, I only looked at the pictures as a look to how you were treated. And frankly in the 40's and 50's my family traveled your land for oil. I can only say sorry again.
315 2018-11-29 23:26:44 HOY AKOANG MGA OIL CONTROL SHEETS GI SULAT SULATAN SKONG MANGHOD IKA DUHA NANI HA! JUSQ TAS DAGHN PA KAAYOG SULOD
316 2018-11-29 23:26:40 Except that the price of oil is up for all but our oil. We are getting about 40% or less of what other markets are getting. Our govt created uncertainty with its policies & actions at a time when they should be doing the opposite.  Trudeau's new bill will stop any new pipeline.
317 2018-11-29 23:26:39 Mmmm ok...i see. I been on some super nigga shit with coconut oil & shea butter combo. You been putting me on game with a lot of stuff from the diva cups to the suede leggings lol to this i really appreciate it
318 2018-11-29 23:26:26 Spent 660 dollars on tires and a oil change ... adulting is so much fun.
319 2018-11-29 23:25:59 Block of grease, same as frytex, dunnes did a cheaper own brand version and still does hydrogenated vegetable oil
320 2018-11-29 23:25:55 New sample fragrance oils! 
Dill Pickles? 
Baked Ham?
Corn Chips?
Oooh! Picnic Lunch anyone?

Baaaa-con!

Motor Oil
Gasoline
Beer?!?
Sounds like a "500 Race" to me!

What else do you see?

The New Year is going to be Super MagnifiScent with all these smell goods
321 2018-11-29 23:25:54 약간....흑백 같으면서 채색 같은 그런거..하고싶어
322 2018-11-29 23:25:49 ありがとうございます(^-^)
323 2018-11-29 23:25:48 We just received these aroma pendants in as a result of a special request.  These are absolutely wonderful!   They can be used on your pet’s collar, a keychain, a child’s backpack or coat zipper.  Great for keeping your favorite oil close.
324 2018-11-29 23:25:44 Chief Magistrate- 

You are personally responsible for over $60 million direct savings lost over your last term due to the corruption refusing to allow shingles in our roads.

You are paying the SWMD to drive that money by way of oil derivatives of the trash.

Your a Hack Jack
325 2018-11-29 23:25:40 Wasn't it Obama that was pulling oil exploration permits from people that had the rights to do it.
326 2018-11-29 23:25:40 채색 스타일 어케 하지 회색이면서도 어둡고 색이 약간 들어간 그런 채색 하고싶다 흠...근데 너무 태양의 시 같아지지 않을까 그런 채색 스타일 다른 만화에서도 몇번 본적이야 있지만 험..
327 2018-11-29 23:25:38 @seanhannity Russia is hurting with the price of oil.
Now is the time to give them a present...I think we should have a caravan of LNG ships on there way to Europe.Give the gas to maybe Germany for a good price.This could really hurt Russia.
328 2018-11-29 23:25:32 going forward, all sauces in food pictures are motor oil
329 2018-11-29 23:25:26 The trouble with capitalism is that eventually you run out of people to exploit.
Thatcher spent all of the UK oil money and sold off our publicly owned utilities and now we’ve little to show for it. 
Her ideology was rotten to the core. 
American (helped by Putin) elected Trump..
330 2018-11-29 23:25:21 No high beam oil.
331 2018-11-29 23:25:20 Day 1 of Keto and CbD oil: I can hear colours I’m finally woke
332 2018-11-29 23:25:19 hey thats amazing do you use oil of olay to look young ? 
333 2018-11-29 23:25:10 gunakan pelembut kulit sepatu/mink oil. Minyak ini hanya digunakan pada sepatu futsal berbahan kulit untuk menjaga warna dan kondisi kulit.
334 2018-11-29 23:25:05 Please tell the whole story.   A very large portion of existing and expansion of palm oil demand is related to producing biodiesel.  Indonesia has increase their mandate to 20% plus the global demand for biofuels
335 2018-11-29 23:25:00 I’m getting an oil change rn and broooooooooooo why is it so expensive
336 2018-11-29 23:24:51 Re: pipelines. Lac Megantic matters in this debate. I live near a rail line in TO. Thousands of gallons of oil roll by three times daily... on 19th century technology, past 3 million people. The pipeline is best option we’ve got during this period of necessary transport of oil.
337 2018-11-29 23:24:40 I will be eternally pissed my dad threw our deep fryer out for this fucking,,,AIR FRYER. Bitch???? I want some goddamn crispy buttermilk fried chicken and instead I’m getting this soft-breading-falling-off ass shit. And we don’t even keep VEGETABLE OIL so I can deep fry via stove
338 2018-11-29 23:24:34 Let's not get started on the "dirty oil" narrative either.
339 2018-11-29 23:24:21 Didn't mean to ignore you. I got a call from one of my Hospice people. They don't care about fear in the world, their time is coming to an end and my goal is to ensure they know the Lord Jesus Christ before they go. My example of the 'oil' is the opposite of ignorance. Have to go
340 2018-11-29 23:24:11 Loves Big Oil
341 2018-11-29 23:24:07 Actually his allowing us to drill for oil domestically was about the best move he made
342 2018-11-29 23:23:58 험..뭄세계 초반부 여캐들만 존나 많이 나오네...근데 후반부도 계속 여캐만 나오것지
343 2018-11-29 23:23:50 Trudeau changed EI rules for Alberta and Saskatchewan after oil prices started to slide to extend benefits. The same is being suggested for Oshawa. When the 2008 recession hit Ontario manufacturing hard, Harper told workers to move to Alberta.
344 2018-11-29 23:23:44 O is out of self control! Oil prices and the economy is a Trump success
345 2018-11-29 23:23:37 Until the major oil production companies are strongly pushed to switch over to alternatively fuel production systems, well, go with what can be worked out, I suppose.
346 2018-11-29 23:23:31 Are you flying somewhere soon? How much CBD oil is allowed in carry-on luggage?
347 2018-11-29 23:23:28 Nose is blocked to fuck. So put some olbis oil on my pillow, maybe put to much on feels like someone’s tear gassed my room ffs
348 2018-11-29 23:23:16 pancakes n motor oil sound kinda good is it just me :/
349 2018-11-29 23:23:11 Clove bud oil helps
And coconut oil too
Praying
350 2018-11-29 23:22:59 also i tried cbd gummy bears rather than the oil but i wanna get on that oil shit
351 2018-11-29 23:22:52 Obama took credit for booming economy and now oil production. 
Will he also take credit for the recent stock market decline and GM closing plans?
And if not is this his official cutoff point for taking credit?
@BarackObama @POTUS44
352 2018-11-29 23:22:39 หมดไปเท่าไหร่กับของมันต้องมี 555
353 2018-11-29 23:22:39 You’ll be alright bro you’ve got oil
354 2018-11-29 23:22:31 I love them so much. Especially when they're coated in oil and garlic salt before baking ughhhhhh
355 2018-11-29 23:22:24 Furthermore Jacobs group has numerous Oil Sand/Coal entanglements, so forgive me if i take their "Reports" with a grain of salt. 

The other company, reputex, simplys tates that there is no single "big" solution.
356 2018-11-29 23:22:18 Yeah sure. Obama and Hilary ran on taxing the oil industries in 2008 and what they were going to do  with the money.  Obama said under my policies energy prices will necessarily sky rocket.  He got elected, sabotaged B. P oil and had a drilling moratorium.
357 2018-11-29 23:22:18 Lightning, Jets, Sens, Oil ML parley.. shoot for the moon tonight fellas
358 2018-11-29 23:22:11 @Juanjo3800  Well they use it in oil fracking.. in order to break rocks too.aren´t they???
359 2018-11-29 23:22:04 A system in which oil is paid for strictly in dollars.Originally signed between the US and the Saudis(& later OPEC) in the 70s after America had ditched the gold standard.The goal is to create artificial demand for dollars thus keeping the $ as a firm currency.
360 2018-11-29 23:22:04 This is not the first time it's been said. I thought McKenna made a similar statement about oil patch workers.
361 2018-11-29 23:22:01 If you're a coffee drinker buy some Bulletproof coffee, Ghee Butter, heavy cream, and XCT Oil.
362 2018-11-29 23:21:47 im not stupid thats motor oil
363 2018-11-29 23:20:36 Yes the Liberals are anti oil and gas which is why our industry is floundering - common knowledge in Alberta and Canada.
Gosh when Trudeau or Morneau show up thousands protest in the streets!
364 2018-11-29 23:20:16 If ur feeling sad check out cbd oil, now that weed is legal it’s even easier to get cbd which has no psychoactive effects and is proven to improve ur overall mood, check it out 
365 2018-11-29 23:20:09 Had a cough so mom made me use an essential oil. I mentioned it smelled too strong and was making my nose run, so she gave me a second oil to dilute the first oil and a third oil bc the other two would cancel each other’s smells out.
366 2018-11-29 23:20:01 #Brent: $59.5 (1.26%)

367 2018-11-29 23:19:54 Maybe a long shot but I know for certain that the SECOND we find oil on the moon, Mars, or other planets we plan to explore, they're all screwed.
368 2018-11-29 23:19:43 前から思ってたんだけど、寝る前に飲むリラックスティーが欲しい
369 2018-11-29 23:19:38 WHOEVER SPILT OLIVE OIL ON THE KITCHEN TABLE I WANT TO T A L K
370 2018-11-29 23:19:38 Looks like good news on the horizon from @Algoma1901 just as some difficult news comes out of @Tenaris. Let’s hope oil prices increase soon and the US’s nonsensical steel tariffs are eliminated soon so that both industries can thrive. #Sault #thesoo
371 2018-11-29 23:19:15 Ima get you some oil for your beard for Christmas woe
372 2018-11-29 23:19:12 みんなで油祭りしようよ。英訳するとオイルフェスティバル。
373 2018-11-29 23:19:03 10/10 will never get another oil change at Midas 
374 2018-11-29 23:19:01 Brothers are so easy to buy Christmas presents for just buy them some shit that says carhartt on it and then watch them wear it with their oil stains and rips until you buy them a new one next Christmas
375 2018-11-29 23:19:00 Popcorns are normally fried in the same pot, in the same oil, at the same time and under the same heat conditions, But they do not all pop at the same time. . .My dear friends never compete with anyone in your life ,your time will come. . .
376 2018-11-29 23:18:34 He sold the country out for a fucking building. Here all this time I thought it was something big like Oil & Gas or Ukraine but just 1 building with his name on it. What a POS.
377 2018-11-29 23:18:34 My skid plate was falling off so that’s why it was scraping, I also have an oil leak, what’s new lol
378 2018-11-29 23:18:32 with less n less plants every years destroyed by SHAVIN FORESTS 2 SELL z WOOD, TO GROW fields of LIVE STOCKS, build golf courses or to plant FOREST OF USELESS PALM OIL TREES, and z rise in FORESTS FIRES, u are not far from z tipping point of no return, oxygen layer very very thin
379 2018-11-29 23:17:58 seething the oil for fun and profit
380 2018-11-29 23:17:57 Ringworm is a fungus, not a worm. People need to understand it. Tea tree oil helps. We had a bunch of kittens we rescued who had it and treated them. No problem. 
381 2018-11-29 23:17:53 You mean the Irving Oil cartel is joining the coalition big big surprise here.
382 2018-11-29 23:17:51 @PnPCBC  We have cap and Trade in Alberta and we are the most innovative oil producers in the world
383 2018-11-29 23:17:43 lol, trudeau's dad saved the tar oil industry, nice try though.
384 2018-11-29 23:17:39 Seeing them people pour motor oil on them pancakes still making me gag days later...
385 2018-11-29 23:17:36 Wasn’t Obama all upset with Trump for not signing the Paris Agreement? Now he wants to take credit for US oil production after he blocked the pipelines. The man is bipolar.
386 2018-11-29 23:17:19 I’m ready to get home, shower, eat, get cozy under my covers, turn on a Christmas movie with some hot chocolate andddd with my oil diffuser  
387 2018-11-29 23:17:12 Disociados, antes que todo. Les venden el mecanismo para joder al pueblo, como su salvación. Y el está creyendo que no se le revierte.....

389 2018-11-29 23:16:48 Just rubbed some vicks in to my chest, going to cover my pillow in olbas oil & some lavender... I am bringing sexy back with aplomb
390 2018-11-29 23:16:47 The world is woke. We no longer are fooled by your motor oil, shaving cream, false filler LIES!
391 2018-11-29 23:16:43 exactly. he's a snake oil salesman. a brilliant one. he's not, ahem, an academic.
392 2018-11-29 23:16:32 Our disposals are on 28” vacuum at 15,000 b/d. 3600’ deep. Producers have 1/2% oil cut. High fluid low cut means high lifting cost to lift all that water. This is to recover energy spent lifting water from producing wells as it’s disposed.
393 2018-11-29 23:16:32 ねむみやばい

勝手に連休にした分際で寝不足とか
394 2018-11-29 23:16:15 Check your Engine oil this morning.
395 2018-11-29 23:16:13 Big deal, they're all in jail about to lose their heads, cancel any all arms transaction and we need a crude oil sanction.
396 2018-11-29 23:16:11 .@michellemungall @GeorgeHeyman Don’t let industry off the hook by implementing weak methane regulations for oil and gas. Inspections based on looking and smelling for an odourless invisible gas just don’t cut it #bcpoli
397 2018-11-29 23:16:10 I do both. Unfortunately when I see them trying to steal our culture, identity and traditions it sets me off. We didn’t preserve these traditions through a genocide only to have a Soviet manufactured oil state try to claim them.
398 2018-11-29 23:15:52 oh yeah there’s a big ass oil spill nobody knew about, and it’s a humongous spill uh,,,,, ,, ITS B I G and was found when cleaning ANOTHER oil spill??
399 2018-11-29 23:15:48 Tea tree oil grease lol
400 2018-11-29 23:15:47 just got a $60 oil change for $20 life’s great 
401 2018-11-29 23:15:47 just got some peppermint essential oil and now i feel gewd
402 2018-11-29 23:15:13 And it's likely to stay this way forever more. As the new emperor of data after a control over oil,  and the great new grip on AI , the US has just sealed its grip on the world far beyond the grasp of China or some new smart new thinktank.
403 2018-11-29 23:15:13 I’m sure a oil oligarch will pick up the tab
404 2018-11-29 23:15:12 The fat bastard is blowing steam and leaking oil.
405 2018-11-29 23:15:00 A meal in 20 minutes! Chicken thigh baked with parmiagiana cheese and olive oil.
406 2018-11-29 23:14:58 Breaking: both are directly related to a global economy that is shifting away from oil consumption.

The free market is a cold, heartless beast. We need to adapt.
407 2018-11-29 23:14:58 Discovered something yesterday. Made Brussels sprouts with coconut oil and cinnamon, roasted the shit out of them. Cinnamon was outrageous

409 2018-11-29 23:14:47 I am a chemical engineer and working in an oil company in Bucharest Romania.
And I belongs to Karachi, Bhai wala
What about you ?
410 2018-11-29 23:14:44 Big deal, they're all in jail about to lose their heads, cancel any all arms transaction and we need a crude oil sanction.
411 2018-11-29 23:14:40 What products are palm oil use in?  Is not possible to stop producing those products.  Obviously, people value the products more than they do the life of the animals.
412 2018-11-29 23:14:38 良いねぇ！！！グッジョブ！！！
413 2018-11-29 23:14:22 Same for you in the US the oil patch just south of me in the Dakotas and Montana. But back to first point, when illegal migrants come in and work for low wages and take away those starting jobs for students and apprentices. The days of learning what hard work is, is gone for kids
414 2018-11-29 23:14:05 It’s not true. I know a construction company was mobilized there by an oil company and are still at the incident scene as we tweet assisting with the search and rescue.
415 2018-11-29 23:14:01 For some people, yes, actually, the coconut oil alone seems to be helpful.  Not a guaranteed slam dunk, but worth trying. Probably more effective in conjunction with a low carb/ketogenic diet, but maybe still helpful on its own.

419 2018-11-29 23:13:44 Trying to create a modern Conservative party out of the smoking ashes of failed alt right failures is kinda like mixing bullshit  with snake oil and expecting to create wisdom.  Not likely.  What you end up with is slippery venomous bullshit.  

Ask Scheer, Kenny, Ford, Bernier.

428 2018-11-29 23:12:46 This reminds me of a time that someone I know subbed olive oil in a boxed brownie recipe that called for vegetable oil, because "They're basically the same, right?" (Nope) and the result was olive-y tasting brownies. Talk about sacrilege, lol. At least this isn't that. :D
429 2018-11-29 23:12:37 It’s all in your head. Stand up to Big OIL
430 2018-11-29 23:12:35 What exploration vessel? You can’t drill for water in land you’ll drill for oil on the bottom of the sea?

435 2018-11-29 23:12:07 Oil fell below $50 a barrel for the first time in over a year, pretty sure that has nothing to do with Ford, but I could be wrong.
436 2018-11-29 23:12:02 Exactly.... And Hoima is busy drilling oil 
437 2018-11-29 23:12:01 Got my oil changed finally after 10,000 Miles 
438 2018-11-29 23:11:56 Except that oil demand globally is surging and emerging markets with a population of 3 billion plus all want oil.  But let’s put thousands of Canadians out of work for dogmatic idealism.

467 2018-11-29 23:09:02 I wasn’t making a judgment, just a recollection. I recall paying around 35 cents a gallon for gas and then prices jumped during the winter of 1973-74 during the Arab oil embargo in the wake of the 1973 Yom Kipper War. $20 an hour? Hell, I’d be tempted to come out of retirement!

500 2018-11-29 23:04:09 There’s more accidents during rain in places where there’s long periods of no rain, because of the accumulated motor oil on the roads. In places with more frequent rain, accidents can increase but it’s not as bad.

503 2018-11-29 23:03:45 Israel and US are there trying to get another pipeline to Europe because they are attempting to isolate Russia from supplying oil and gas to Europe as they have been doing for years. US NeoCON Israeli Firster fools are looking for a war with Russia & they just might get one.

514 2018-11-29 23:02:19 You have to look at all this from 20 different angles to see the entire picture. I see no way for Russia to get hurt by cutting now and boosting later. Everyone wins if the price of oil goes higher. Russia loses if prices stay low cause they can't negotiate a fair cut with OPEC.

531 2018-11-29 23:00:15 It’s not a conspiracy theory to acknowledge that oil is a strategic interest to the US. We wouldn’t be involved in the Mid East if it weren’t.

Can you explain why Trump was pretending that Saudi oil made such a difference? We import more oil from Canada.
532 2018-11-29 23:00:15 Simple Exports grew because of oil prices. More that 20% of our exports are petrol or petroleum products. our exports tend to fall when oil prices fall.

That where supply and demand comes in, if their is a shortage of help. For us it was the Oil patch (Fort MacMurray Alberta) with high wages.

538 2018-11-29 22:59:59 My point is this: Israel has no legitimate business being in Syria. Oil and Gas inside Syria is none of Israel's business to begin with, nor does it belong to Israel. The US has no business there, either. Israel & US are violating International Law.
539 2018-11-29 22:59:44 The plan laid out by the Notley Govt does both. Not building a pipeline forces us into maintaining a price differential on oil and costs thousands of jobs.

555 2018-11-29 22:58:17 President Trump has sent weapons to Ukraine, killed Russians in Syria, put sanctions on RU, driven down the value of RU oil, increased the military and put sanctions on RU. Obama took no action against RU, he was unilaterally de-arming the US. But Trump is in Putin's pocket?

561 2018-11-29 22:57:19 I really love @lushcosmetics buuuuuut being from the city booming with oil sands doesn’t help me feel the love back  just FYI out of my family of 6 only 1 person works directly for them.. and it helped keep our family together ! It’s keeping many families together or afloat
562 2018-11-29 22:57:10 You have it backwards, it’s the oil sector and Alberta that has propped up Canada not the other way round
563 2018-11-29 22:57:03 U.S. total crude shipments and refined product exports jump to a record high #oil #crude #Commodities
564 2018-11-29 22:57:02 U.S. total crude shipments and refined product exports jump to a record high #oil #crude #Commodities
565 2018-11-29 22:57:01 U.S. total crude shipments and refined product exports jump to a record high #oil #crude #Commodities
566 2018-11-29 22:56:56 Energy? Maybe he's mean petrol prices are coming down. But that is because global oil prices are falling nothing to do with them.
567 2018-11-29 22:56:51 There are 20 million people from LA to the Mexican border. That’s a lot of oil that hasn’t been washed off the roads in 10 years of drought. It’s like black ice with a lot of idiot transplants who leave their driving skills in whatever frozen hell they came from.
568 2018-11-29 22:56:48 ありがとうございます
569 2018-11-29 22:56:06 I’m not sure you realize that what we are paying up here works out to $4.80/gallon down there. Your less than half of what we pay and it’s OUR oil. That is a real issue with our government  and Canadians.
570 2018-11-29 22:56:04 If you give MBS a journalist, he’ll lower the price of oil. 

It’s like If You Give a Mouse a Cookie but with murder and lower gas prices.
571 2018-11-29 22:55:53 10% reduction is no better than Notleys little threats. When you go to a street fight you go prepared to win. A 50 % reduction of oil shipments to the theiving Americans will get their attention quickly.
572 2018-11-29 22:55:49 Why not oil is worth at best 4bn a year. You have a £13bn hand out from England each year. GERS proved that Scotland COSTS England money
573 2018-11-29 22:55:43 I know lots of ppl that was laid off in the oil fields because of Obama
574 2018-11-29 22:55:40 Thanks to these tree oil drops I can finally wear my thongs without getting irritated, even when they ride up!

579 2018-11-29 22:55:23 The children of these oil revenue thieves come to the USA and are given scholarships & grants meant for NBA to make up for centuries of our disenfranchisement.

These African & Caribbean elites are helping disenfranchise my people.
580 2018-11-29 22:55:20  Data is the new oil!
581 2018-11-29 22:55:18 I feel so awful and IDK what I need to make me feel better. So far I've come up with (a) a seductive rub down with cannabis oil or (b) a slap in the face.
582 2018-11-29 22:55:13 Musk Oil.
583 2018-11-29 22:55:05 Do you guys ever think about how much money you’re willing to spend on really unnecessary shit but you never let the oil change people change your air filter? Is this just me?
584 2018-11-29 22:54:54 I fancy coconut oil

586 2018-11-29 22:54:45 Me to my coworker: “you wanna get drunk at 9am before I get my oil changed?” 
587 2018-11-29 22:54:39 Why is the main ingredient oil?
588 2018-11-29 22:54:37 when iHop doesn’t give you motor oil you asked for <<<
589 2018-11-29 22:54:31 My olive oil and canola oil is essential. Also they don't have a union, so they don't get the same rights as other oils.
590 2018-11-29 22:54:27 Cut in wedges. Roast them for less than 12-15 mins on high heat (425•ish) with coarse salt flakes and liiiight coat of good olive oil. You don’t wanna drown in oil though. My fave is with parsley or dill and burrata, or as a side with roasted root veggies.
591 2018-11-29 22:54:18 I use it every time I shower. I swear its a game changer lol. My face would get oily like an hour after I showered. When I put makeup on it would be worse   Do you moisturize too? Make sure it’s oil free...
592 2018-11-29 22:54:17 I am informing you what has gone on in the Golan Heights. Chirp Chirp. Israel is stealing Syrian gas, oil, and fresh water there, too.
593 2018-11-29 22:54:05 Ask anyone that depended on offshore oil for a living what Obama's "contribution" was to the industry.
594 2018-11-29 22:54:04 Using the whole bag of epsom salt to soak in w/ lavender oil
595 2018-11-29 22:54:04 it really is. and i totally don't mind being such a stereotype. i like doing my own car maintenance. i need to change the oil next.
596 2018-11-29 22:54:03 I mean ... not today anyway

I just though we had more time, y’know? Alas. That’s many noops to the oil baron again
597 2018-11-29 22:53:59 ออยเคยไปดูครั้งแรกเอง ตอนนั้นเค้ามาฟิวรังสิตอะ
598 2018-11-29 22:53:44 OH! C'mon Gary, common sense and politics ?, have more chance mixing oil and water !!
599 2018-11-29 22:53:43 Not only that I know person whose father is flat earth believer... I’ve just realised that another guy I know speaks that olive oil boils at 60° and water at 150-160°C. 

Now I have some serious questions to ask myself about why I know them...

603 2018-11-29 22:53:23 What on Earth is the Average American driving that produces so much CO2? An oil refinery?

605 2018-11-29 22:53:12 Then you know that the roads exude oil when it first rains that make conditions extra slick? Good, you can pass the word that the first rain is more dangerous than subsequent.

ありがとうございます
610 2018-11-29 22:53:00 I disagree. We are at a crucial crossroads in this battle w/climate, and DT is preventing a lot of climate action from taking place, by controlling the EPA, drilling for more oil, refusing to acknowledge it and its effects, and promoting many detrimental policies. We're losing.
611 2018-11-29 22:52:46 Poorer...  this clown @nadhimzahawi doesn’t know what “poor” means - he pockets ££££££ From Iraqi Oil Companies (for what?) supposed to be a Full Time MP. Yet got £253,200 bonus in 2017... he won’t be poor after #Brexit self serving Tory #BBCQT - #PeoplesVote is needed!!!
612 2018-11-29 22:52:41 It’s good but I’m interested in their use of ‘sustainable’ palm oil on their granola - would like them to use an alternative really.
613 2018-11-29 22:52:38 also,,, oil??
614 2018-11-29 22:52:07 ありラジラでございます
615 2018-11-29 22:52:04 talk about the best way to really lose your manufacturing jobs and ignore the profitable oil sector.  You can have our drama queen PM Justine T!
616 2018-11-29 22:51:43 China could be a very big help to Canada build roads buy our oil  and trees  and waste from our throw away society. Help Trudeau with how to be a model communist. Lend him billions of cash dollars, help with off shore account's fight for Canada  because of the oil we have, lol
617 2018-11-29 22:51:43 Got that right, especially when he's taking credit for the oil prices he claims we can thank him when it was all your hard work that brought it about. Getting kinda old hearing him flap his gums about it being his doings.
618 2018-11-29 22:51:43 Won't the Montreal  mob running the port love that! That's likely the whole reason Quebec imports foreign oil.
619 2018-11-29 22:51:37 Nadhim Zahawi mmmmn... Hasn’t he been paid a load of dosh from a dodgy oil company he invested in years ago... And yet he’s an MP and Minister. Democracy, my arse. We’re as corrupt as the next country... #bbcqt

621 2018-11-29 22:51:31 Trump is trying to stop the drillers from making any money. Trump is no longer a friend of the American oil drillers. Those future campaign contributions are going straight into the consumer's gas tank right now.

626 2018-11-29 22:50:59 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
627 2018-11-29 22:50:58 Wondering if it would be appropriate to suck the oil out of her coconuts
628 2018-11-29 22:50:57 She's a "pastor" for a gimcrack US snake oil salesman with a track record of skimming off 60% of donations for "admin". You got conned. Admit it. #newsnight #NewsnightVicar
629 2018-11-29 22:50:55 @BullsBearsFBN Obama takes credit for oil. Thn CNN blames 276,000 fewer children insured in 2017 on Trump, could it be Obamacare costs?
630 2018-11-29 22:50:52 @oil_saburo テイクオフQヒットおめでとうございます
631 2018-11-29 22:50:48 My statement has nothing to do with the Golan Heights. Please inform yourself about what’s happening now regarding the oil and gas. I just don’t have time to write it all out for you. It will all unfold quickly when it happens. I wish you nothing but blessings.
632 2018-11-29 22:50:42 The GOP and the DNC banded together in an attempt to destabilize the Middle East (again) and raise the cost of oil. Greed and War, the only thing that the Neos can think of. I find it Sad that I have to lecture my elders as if they were school children.
633 2018-11-29 22:50:35 @oil_saburo おいるさん、おめ～
634 2018-11-29 22:50:35 For exctracting CBD oil you would generally want to use indicas because of their higher levels of CBD. For getting high sativa and indicas are both psychoactive. Stop being so ignorant and maybe try to be a bit informed before making blatantly wrong statements like you are.
635 2018-11-29 22:50:33 @ctvottawa 1 Billion for refugees !!! Focus should be on decades long tax payers in Alberta's oil patch. We abandon our own and take care of the new for votes. Disgraceful and demeaning. Starting to feel embarrassed to be Canadian thanks to Justin Trudeau

637 2018-11-29 22:50:30 Mmm...motor oil...
638 2018-11-29 22:50:25 Quebec is now howling at the fools they made of the Anglos that wanted to build Energy East. Meanwhile Saudi oil strangles our own oil. And the French now expect schmoozy talk for their image? Don't think so!
639 2018-11-29 22:50:20 Please, I'd rather read the instruction manual on changing the oil in my car then read anything from anyone you recommend.  I know it's all a lie, so why waste my time?  Jeanine is just about as batschit crazy as you. NOOO THANKS
640 2018-11-29 22:50:11 What people don’t realize is at first Hitler just wanted to kick the Jews out of Germany. It was the Nazis connections in the Middle East (for oil) that the Islamic Grand Mufti convinced Himler and Hitler of annihilation of the Jews.
641 2018-11-29 22:50:10 @UrbalActiv is the oil supposed to be white? I received my order a few days ago and it's not a typical "oil" color.
642 2018-11-29 22:50:05 Really depends on what they are, and this may be beyond their control. TV is not just for entertainment, if it was things like equal time regs wouldn't apply. 
These companies also engage in commerce by being platforms for ppl to conduct business
643 2018-11-29 22:50:01 Something bad happened to him either with his food or what but now he has to be on different food and have more pumpkin or coconut oil every day to help with his digestion. He looves canned pumpkin at least xD
644 2018-11-29 22:49:57 Standard!
645 2018-11-29 22:49:54 @cvpayne I'm a big fan of yours but, call a lie a lie. Say it clearly so everyone understands. Oil production didn't grow because of Obama, it grew in spite of Obama.

648 2018-11-29 22:49:23 I’m about to drink castor oil and orange juice. Bet I have a baby tomorrow
649 2018-11-29 22:49:10 Castor oil is great , it not only helps with growth but it’s harmless as well to your scalp
650 2018-11-29 22:49:08 "Probably would be best.

Lemme know if I can help."

In the meantime, Sadie would simply begin to clean her revolvers, dabbing some gun oil onto a rag and applying itvto the barrel.
651 2018-11-29 22:49:05 Saw a commercial for Burger King pancakes and all I could think about was motor oil
652 2018-11-29 22:49:05 石油だってオリーブオイルだって変わらぬオイルだ。だからみんな、資源は大切に使おう。

655 2018-11-29 22:48:52 And what would you call capitalism? How many people are dead because they can’t afford basic necessities like food, shelter and housing? How many killed in wars for oil?
656 2018-11-29 22:48:43 #thankyouStringTheoryNOT ... The failure of string theory has left the public with the taste of snake oil.  And the credibility of science suffers as a result.  Media can compete with sensationalism only so long.  But who is to blame?  Should there be consequences for surviving?
657 2018-11-29 22:48:43 Literally went into this spot by my job for 5 minutes to see how much an oil change is and come back and a nigg tried to run off w/ my license plate 
658 2018-11-29 22:48:39 I just dropped my suorin in a bucket of oil

660 2018-11-29 22:48:16 Every time I see a pancake advertisement I just think Of motor oil and cardboard
661 2018-11-29 22:48:04 Old oil cooks the best chips. If you put my chips in some fresh oil, throw them in the bin
662 2018-11-29 22:48:02 But you’ll be traction’ed up and no more oil drips! #153000miles
663 2018-11-29 22:48:00 I see the logic  I see your point  but...BUT does grease and oil and more grease = unhealthy???  I think we’ll have to look into the rule books for this one
664 2018-11-29 22:47:59 We are dealing with a stupid stupid government.  Complete fking fools.  Getting oil from Saudi has to be connected with the deal to supply them with arms.  Canadians can no longer even come up with the words to describe this psycho leadership.  It's that bad.
665 2018-11-29 22:47:58 My 15 year old has a mass in her thyroid and was born with a bleeding her platelets this week were the highest they have ever been.  I swear my cbd oil now definitely worth trying
666 2018-11-29 22:47:54 A friend : "You've been dating people that are like frying oil, people that are cheap and burn you up inside" I've never been so SHOOK
667 2018-11-29 22:47:52 It reminds me of the snake oil salesmen of yore.  I may have anti-inflammatory properties, but so does aspirin. I see the FDA in their future, and not in a good way.
668 2018-11-29 22:47:51 Disagree. Your car, planes, this country doesn’t work without oil.
669 2018-11-29 22:47:47 Just a quick reminder @JohnKerry and @JoeBiden got their sons jobs at Urkraine Oil Corps through nepotism. NEXT.

671 2018-11-29 22:47:37 I grew up on the south shore of Long Island, and we had an oil burner!  Hadn’t thought about it til I saw your tweet! Yes, it gets cold real quick when that oil burner goes out!great idea for Gracie, the heating pad. 
672 2018-11-29 22:47:33 Important data releases across the northern hemisphere painted a mixed picture, alternating between modest surprise and slight disappointment. Oil featured once again against the backdrop of a weaker US dollar @MicMcCarthy_CMC
673 2018-11-29 22:47:31 Your wife did not do this for me. I had to go get my own tires and oil change yesterday only to be told that they didn’t have the kind of wipers I needed. I did a quick zoomie out to get food for tonight so I don’t have to try and see out my windshield. 
674 2018-11-29 22:47:26 Israel wanted the oil, gas, and fresh water long before Russian and Iran got involved in Syria. Exactly why Israel is illegally occupying Golan Heights. Israel sold those rights to others for lots of shekels. It wasn't theirs to sell.
675 2018-11-29 22:47:19 So putin really doesn't need more oil nations,  putin wants the price to rise,  best way he can do that is treat USA like we treated russia and place sanctions
To do this in the most effective way he will seize the Suez canal then putin can control all world trade from that point
676 2018-11-29 22:47:14 @CdnPolitique @albertaNDP Building infrastructure to provide more oil is incompatible with fighting #climatechange.
677 2018-11-29 22:46:46 My dad insisted to get the big ass oil for my car  there goes my money lol
678 2018-11-29 22:46:38 Hold on there's a good reason why CBD oil is mixed with hemp seed oil and other carriers

Hemp seed oil is rich in omega-3's which help your body process the CBD. Coconut oil is also commonly used because of the multi-chain triglycerides. There's a lot more details - but twitter.
679 2018-11-29 22:46:36 They’ll fade so much in time so don’t worry! I’ve got them on my hips and boobs so far from this pregnancy & they’re super purple/red. Are you using oil or cream?! X
680 2018-11-29 22:46:25 I love it I use it for my hot oil treatments and it’s convenient that I can use it at home too.
681 2018-11-29 22:46:23 Let me share what the Lord shared with me regarding prophecy. It's not a story to be told around a campfire to frighten small children. It is the oil of the wise virgins who brought enough to keep their light until the bridegroom and wedding party arrive. No fear, period.
682 2018-11-29 22:46:13 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
683 2018-11-29 22:46:04 Tell people to stop using oil, I believe they will be okay. Shitting on a plate they eat will do them justice.
684 2018-11-29 22:46:00 Got fired this morning. Not my fault he decided to send a truck away with a fucked oil cooler. In desperate need of work don't care what it is.
685 2018-11-29 22:45:56 A con man selling more snake oil
686 2018-11-29 22:45:55 That's just an excuse. It's ALWAYS about profit, or they would just use diplomacy. They want whatever resources that country has, mainly Oil. Or in the case of Afghanistan, Opium. 
It's always about profit, that's what capitalism is all about.
687 2018-11-29 22:45:53 Oil change?
688 2018-11-29 22:45:45 How's @JohnKerry stepson doing at his Ukrainian Oil job Pops got for him?
689 2018-11-29 22:45:44 5 minutes to change the oil and filter off my car
690 2018-11-29 22:45:39 Minister Canavan breaking it down for the youth. "Build mines, do geology and how to drill for oil and gas "which is one of the most remarkable science exploits in the world". "These are the type of things that excite young children and we should be great at as a nation".
691 2018-11-29 22:45:38 Obama : Suddenly America is the biggest oil producer ; That was me. ... This is the same clown  who saw big oil , fracking as a 4 letter word
692 2018-11-29 22:45:34 Willing to rub some oil on just in case.
693 2018-11-29 22:45:33 I laugh how these oil and gas companies who bring us energy to make our lives so much better and then seemingly apologize for doing it. Here we have the double virtue signal of Climate Change and girls in STEM.
694 2018-11-29 22:45:28 They want Israel’s warm water port and their newly discovered huge oil and gas resources that Israel plans to sell to Europe.

696 2018-11-29 22:45:17 You are aware that the arms deal with KSA was a secret deal with Harper that has huge financial penalties, right? It's not a Liberal deal. Also it's private oil companies and not the CDN govt that buys Saudi oil.

701 2018-11-29 22:44:40 Currently, he’s going around saying how he is responsible for the current economy and the huge US increase in oil production. It’s pitiful and he’s making himself look bad. Bush totally left Obama alone. Quiet as a mouse.
702 2018-11-29 22:44:25 This is hilarious, Obummer trying to take credit for oil production when he did everything he could to destroy oil production.
703 2018-11-29 22:44:12 #mining $GLD #energy #economy $ES $OIL futureconomy Thank you for shining the Spotlight on the future of Canada's mining industry and #DisruptMining 2019!
704 2018-11-29 22:44:11 @goodyear customer service was terrible today 2 hrs for an oil change. To find out at the end that they never contact me that my car was done and hour earlier even though I was in the waiting lobby.... beyond annoyed 
705 2018-11-29 22:44:08 You need to use something besides oil  like a cream or light grease
706 2018-11-29 22:44:04 How about former President Barack Obama taking credit for our oil and gas boom… Very funny that he was 1000% against fracking and now here he is claiming responsibility for the boom… Very disingenuous & deceitful to his loyal cult
707 2018-11-29 22:44:00 Every influencer on earth is trying to sell me CBD oil at the same time.  That shit isn’t even real weed lol games
708 2018-11-29 22:43:59 Obama couldn’t produce a grease fire much less produce 
Large amts. of oil especially here in America, the country he hates to the point of trying to turn us into a communist 
Country. His legacy will be found in the fiction section of the library!
709 2018-11-29 22:43:58 Yes. And to deepen the story, to add subtlety. Like someone who works in oil, adding layer after layer of paint, catching the light to bring the work to life. That is hard work, but it pays off. :)

711 2018-11-29 22:43:51 Saw a 15 yr old today, all grown up but acting rather sheepish...

...apparently I told him when he was 5 that he might turn into a fish after he ate a whole tub of cod liver oil capsules!

I felt very old!

(But pleased he didn't raid any more medicine bottles again!)

712 2018-11-29 22:43:40 stop playing with oil, all in BTC and XRP !!! the moon man, the moon !
713 2018-11-29 22:43:38 if I see those motor oil pancakes on my tl one more time
714 2018-11-29 22:43:38 With the paris accord,  freeworld was signalling we are exiting the il industry,  but we were keeping the prices of oil low so we can place a carbon type tax on oil,  now we can't afford that and that money was to pay to transition to green power
We wanted to leave oil worthless
715 2018-11-29 22:43:36 @thepeoplescourt dude trying to sue saying mechanics put oil on his bike tires. . What a moron and scam artist. He will have it tested. Hahaha what a scamming douche. Learn to ride moron. Trying to get money to cover your negligence. Loser.

7. Rinse with vinegar
720 2018-11-29 22:43:19 食パンさん、おはようございます！
721 2018-11-29 22:43:11 @BarackObama another deception 4U 2 say oil industry gained. Uimposed so much regulation on off shore drillers that most filed for bankruptcy. SDRL  for one.These losses cost many small investors to lose millions of $
722 2018-11-29 22:43:04 You do not have a plan which will meet Canada's Paris commitments. Your carbon pricing plan, especially on the backstop, gives far greater exemptions to coal and oil than other producers. It reeks of special privilege and will erode your ability to sell as a fair one to Canadians
723 2018-11-29 22:42:58 Forgive me, that’s clearly a oil panting to be hung in the sitting room
724 2018-11-29 22:42:52 We are paying $1.28 per LITRE up here in Canada and that’s OUR oil your buying down there. I don’t get it. 
725 2018-11-29 22:42:45 I got a free oil change today

It’s the little things.
726 2018-11-29 22:42:44 Oil companys where expanding due to promises on pipelines the Harper  Goverment  made..but its easer to throw shit at the libs..who are trying to salvage something  thats not their mess to starr
727 2018-11-29 22:42:21 Not the pure oregano oil- she’s not sniffing it she’s taking tabs or a tincture- girl knows what’s up
728 2018-11-29 22:42:14 I've never been to Texas, mostly because I'm terrified of getting impaled by the horns on the front of an oil baron's Cadillac.
729 2018-11-29 22:42:03 I see these digital platforms similar to advent of radio or TV. At the time the full implications of what they would become wasn't immediately apparent. Over time regulations evolved. Same thing will happen here.
730 2018-11-29 22:41:59 Your question is asked from a USD centric lens, as opposed to an oil centric lens.  Given that Russia sold USD's & bought gold in latest USD shortage, perhaps your question should be asked from both perspectives?
731 2018-11-29 22:41:57 Very stupid idea to put olbas oil on my pillows
732 2018-11-29 22:41:49 If I knew wild growth oil smelled like this, I would’ve left it right on the shelf.
733 2018-11-29 22:41:48 Yep. We are #9 and Canada contributes 1.69% (w/ our oil sands) of the world's global GHG emissions.  The top 5 countries combine for a total of 62.53%.  Again, my POV is you have to deal with the 'big rocks' first or you're just going to be mucking around in grains of sand.

735 2018-11-29 22:41:10 "Imperfect candidate"???

Trump was also an imperfect candidate, so what?

Do you seriously not see the flaw in your logic?

It's a bit like, "this candle is not a kerosene lamp, but that whale oil lamp is not a flashlight".
736 2018-11-29 22:41:09 I’ve been using tea tree oil on my face for the past couple of weeks and zzzzzzzzomg
737 2018-11-29 22:41:09 This is based on strict reality. She even skipped the fact that the Us has increased oil exports and oil is cheap; Russia is losing billions daily
738 2018-11-29 22:41:04 @NYR_Official, why do your soaps come wrapped in plastic inside their box? Seems unnecessary. Trying to be plastic and palm oil free and would love to count on you for both.
739 2018-11-29 22:40:58 Another democrat milestone! After All Gore invented the internet, I thought nothing could compete. Now we find out Obama single handedly made the US the largest oil producer on earth!!  Who knew blocking drilling, access to oil and pipelines would actually increase production!
740 2018-11-29 22:40:55 Day 654 of business school:

"You can tell someone's work ethic by how high they cross their t's" 

What is happening
741 2018-11-29 22:40:46 You Sir are an absolute disaster.  I am offended that you would think that anyone is dumb enough to give you credit for Trumps oil and gas surge, our unemployment records, our incredible economy or our stock market!! You wish you were half the president that he was!!! Laughable
742 2018-11-29 22:40:37 ya i use honey straws infused with cbd sometimes if i can’t sleep but i’ve never tried for anxiety! it worked tho so i’m definitely going to buy some oil. it’s so embarrassing and scary when i have an attack in public.

747 2018-11-29 22:40:23 This isn't new. Their disdain for Ab's goes back years when they first got on the boycott alberta oil bandwagon. Though the company is OK heating their stores/driving cars with foreign oil in Ontario/Quebec.

Have not shopped there since their initial hate for Ab's first arose.

749 2018-11-29 22:40:15 Covering the commuter rail train that caught on fire this morning, @KeolisBoston tells us they believe oil inside the turbocharger leaked out, causing it to smoke. The train in question is at a maintenance facility in Somerville undergoing inspections.

I wonder what the #vegan community think. The prescribed laws of #Veganism seem out-dated. Palm oil production is destroying agriculture, humane bee farms are saving it.

773 2018-11-29 22:38:53 What kind of sensors are used to determine position/trajectory? I'd guess similar to directional drilling in oil and gas
774 2018-11-29 22:38:26 I thought I saw a documentary about it. Maybe they invented something that helped drill for oil.

that’s not your man. that’s crude oil and the government is after him
779 2018-11-29 22:37:42 "We did not stop hunting and slaughtering whales because we suddenly cared about whales, but because kerosene burned more cleanly and was cheaper.

789 2018-11-29 22:36:47 I never once claimed that I do not use oil products.  However, I would like to see them used wisely, not wasted ... so the “hypocrite” tag, well, that’s your opinion and you are entitled to it.  Perhaps I was a bit melodramatic in my first tweet ...

805 2018-11-29 22:35:04 Okay um??? So, I haven't changed my oil in over a year and I finally got it changed today and they came back to tell me what was wrong with it (I was expecting a lot) and they just said my wiper blades were leaving streaks? My Ruby is such a trooper

813 2018-11-29 22:33:44 Thanks Paul, but I've been around for sometime, and remember the oil embargo of 1979; That was at time when you had odd/even number days when you could buy gasoline my friend. Yup, it really happend Paul.
814 2018-11-29 22:33:38 Understand, each CND uses 66bbl of oil each yr. What you’re talking about is an impossibility. The only two sources of energy for CND is nuclear or oil to continue to have the quality of life you enjoy now. Replacing the combustion engine will take more than a decade alone

The oil crisis in SK and AB is caused by Obama providing incentives to alternative oil production methods that has resulted in the US becoming a net exporter of oil. Dog whistler.
835 2018-11-29 22:31:53 I order a sub from the deli across the street every week, and every week they ask me “lettuce tomato oil mayo???” I say yes, open up the sandwich, and proceed to pick off the tomatoes. Every damn time. I swear I was dropped on my head as a child.
836 2018-11-29 22:31:40 ‘That Was Me People’, Obama Has The Nerve To Take Credit for American Oil Despite His Anti-Oil Policies. Why does anybody Still Listen to This Fool?
837 2018-11-29 22:31:39 It's already started.
Oil industry wants government to build seawall to protect refineries from climate change effects.
838 2018-11-29 22:31:24 I get a lil but if oil on my body from work and I feel like petty from fast n the furious 
839 2018-11-29 22:31:24 Either, or with just some olive oil.
Instead of a normal pizza sauce, you could top it with a thin layer of puttanesca with shrimp and a couple of kinds of cheese, then a handful of arugula after it comes out of the oven.
840 2018-11-29 22:31:21 Brown about 4 pork chops, not cooked just brown with chops dipped in flour. Brown in a small amount of oil. Throw in pot , 1 can of chucked and rice soup. Do not add water. Cover and cook. You’ll have rice and fall off the bone pork chops. I season with garlic salt and onion powd
841 2018-11-29 22:31:17 I saved my money and recieve oil and gas royality checks that help. House paid off... Also I sold a bunch of posessions, motorcyles, boats, art work, guitars...basically every thing I dont need...still kept a ton of stuff...if I ever run out I still have skills.

853 2018-11-29 22:30:23 Didn’t he fight against fracking? Didn’t he increase their permits to drill from under 100 pages to several hundred pages? Doesn’t sound like he was helping. Certain states did increase oil production after they drugged through the growing restrictions he placed on them.
854 2018-11-29 22:30:22 Thank you. One more question - do you label that the palm oil used is RSPO certified ? How would customers know this about M&S or any orher company ?
855 2018-11-29 22:30:10 it really piss me off how before the iranian revolution things were going pretty good until the cia reestablished a fucking monarchy and deposed the democratically elected prime minister because he nationalized the oil industry

858 2018-11-29 22:29:52 In their defense, because it never rains here, there’s a lot of built up, dried oil on the roads from cars, so when it does finally rain, it does get extremely slippery because of it.

866 2018-11-29 22:29:15 Hey Rachel, remember the 8 track music player? When nobody wanted it anymore a lot of jobs were lost. It’s called obsolescence. The same thing is happening with oil. The world doesn’t want it anymore, it’s dying. Cars are becoming a liability so we are using rapid transit etc.
867 2018-11-29 22:29:14 Uh, trump and honesty certainly don’t mix. It’s like oil and water.

870 2018-11-29 22:28:45 Because the oil production environmental impacts in Saudi Arabia are not within Canada’s jurisdiction to regulate.

NEB did NOT do a fine job. It’s precisely why there is so much resistance to pipelines. Their implicit approval before environmental impacts were obvious.
871 2018-11-29 22:28:44 He closed the gulf of Mexico to oil drilling for 5 months, wasn't encouraging the keystone pipeline, put federal lands off limits to oil, it was the state's like Texas, Pennsylvania that allowed drilling/ fracking not Obama. Nothing good came out of the Obama administration!
872 2018-11-29 22:28:35 Sweet Jesus!!
Our oil industry is almost dead and our auto industry is quickly following but the Green Party of one (crazy cat lady Elizabeth May) wants to spend time talking about whales and dolphins.

What is happening in our gvmt???

881 2018-11-29 22:27:22 I agree AND they should add stink oil so no one would take them in to hide from ICE! 
882 2018-11-29 22:27:21 I would think that adding butter or coconut oil (semi-solid) might work? or shortening? Something that stays fairly solid at room temp.
883 2018-11-29 22:27:17 I have family in Texas & have been going there for more than 30 years.  
The whole 8 years in office He did nothing but shut down all the oil production in that state to nothing but abandoned oil wells!
He is the biggest Traitor our country has ever seen!
@BarackObama loser!!
884 2018-11-29 22:27:13 That makes sense. I’ve never seen an oil can that looks like that

887 2018-11-29 22:26:59 I was in Sudan a couple of months ago. A Chinese oil company follows localization role - 90% of employees are local Sudanese.

891 2018-11-29 22:26:38 Touts paris accord which is to reduce carbon emissions based on fossil fuels by taxing them out but then says he is reason why oil prices are down? 

Some irony in that logic
892 2018-11-29 22:26:34 is it in brine instead of sunflower oil or something?
893 2018-11-29 22:26:32 Actually we have a lot of women in the oil and gas into that do their job just fine and they love their job.

898 2018-11-29 22:25:56 Since most of our electricity is still generated by burning fossil fuels, moving to electric cars does not eliminate our demand for oil. We would need 35-45 new nuclear power plants to do that.
899 2018-11-29 22:25:54 You may be correct that there r some mistakes that occur when drilling &extraction of oil currently,which led to the recurrence of earthquakes during the past 5-6years,which in turn opens the question of what tools and materials that r used &injected in the ground @ashwaqalmudhaf

904 2018-11-29 22:25:43 So? 1. you want more pipeline capacity built.
2. You want to cut oil production.
 Sound like great public policy.

912 2018-11-29 22:24:37 By this thread, clearly the oil companies have conspired to defraud Uganda. The question is, are govt negotiators patriotic enough to fight for the best deal for their nation?

All the truths must be prevailed in the public media. No more political games!
914 2018-11-29 22:24:29 Saudi Arabia is a strategic Ally in the region. Just as Brennan had Khashoggi executed, just to point the finger at MBS, we now see Ukraine provoke Russia to justify Martial Law. These acts all come down to Oil, Money and Access! Trump knows it all!

926 2018-11-29 22:23:39 What about the REAL conspiracy of Trump calling on Putin to assist in the election, in exchange for the eventual lifting of sanctions. Appointing Tillerson as Secretary, to fly the world without question, aligning oil excavation deals on behalf of Russia?
927 2018-11-29 22:23:35 You do realize, Trump is keeping oil prices low deliberately, right?

931 2018-11-29 22:23:16 The problem is using this kind of things and the act of some groups then generalize it on a whole religion because there is people already are afraiding of what they dont know and being redirected towards. it's like throwing oil on the the fire.
932 2018-11-29 22:23:13 The US doesn't need more of our oil. We need to sell it to china. So unless these rail cars fly (or swim) there is no point.

942 2018-11-29 22:22:29 Let’s be honest. Because honesty is hard to come by.
Oil brings a boom - small towns turn into busy little towns with full hotels and no vacancy and the property values sky rocket and there is WORK. But it also brings problems. And to deny that is ignorant

955 2018-11-29 22:20:37 Well, it’s an oil leak (which I knew my car was downing oil) that *smelled* like a fuel leak. And, seeing that I was hydroplaning more than usual, even for my car, on the way here, I told them to check those tire treads and yup! I need some new rubber as well.    
956 2018-11-29 22:20:29 5 quarts of oil? A queen.
957 2018-11-29 22:20:19 He a arrogant blatant liar ! You know he had nothing to do with the oil production doing great , he did things to hurt production not help it ! The oil companies started fracking & that’s what boosted production ! He didn’t want them fracking 
958 2018-11-29 22:20:15 Alberta could have used their oil surpluses to build infrastructure for a 21st century economy. Now they’ll have to in deficit. I have sympathy for struggling Albertans that their leaders didn’t do better by them.
959 2018-11-29 22:20:14 So funny when you look at the thousands of regulations he imposed on oil and gas and how much he tried to block pipelines, drill platforms, and fracking operations.  Yet now that it's a success he wants to take credit.  This guy IS and always has been a moron!
960 2018-11-29 22:20:14 Yeah, that's why the Saudis suddenly upped oil production. There is more than one way to skin a cat.

973 2018-11-29 22:18:52 if i learned anything in 2018 it’s that all syrup in commercials is actually motor oil
974 2018-11-29 22:18:52 Not surprised and not buying.  He cares about big oil and big business and little else.
975 2018-11-29 22:18:47 I don't like Obama but his amendment to a protectionist law  did give rise to oil production. This however was a drag on GDP growth in the US over 2014/2015. In addition with a high % of corporate debt linked to oil price, this almost caused debt default issues in US.
976 2018-11-29 22:18:42 A good oil, hair cream, hair pick, and wig brush to extend it. And you'll be great
977 2018-11-29 22:18:33 Data is the new oil
978 2018-11-29 22:18:30 Nagmakaawa? Ikaw ang magresearch hija  "bumaba ang demand for oil globally" kaya dumami ang stocks uli therefore, bumaba ang presyo. Yan ang hirap sa mga kagay mo na kay Mocha at Sass lang kumukuha ng facts. Come'on. Kaya dadalawa lang ang followers mo eh.
979 2018-11-29 22:18:13 Helloooo~

That'd be a good time to bring the body oil. 
980 2018-11-29 22:18:11 Yooo I just need my oil changed... like that's it. Dont need air in my tires. Dont need windshield washing fluid or whatever else your offering. Just the oil
981 2018-11-29 22:18:04 I love being a girl. I got a free car wash on Sunday & now a free oil change at the dealership:’)
982 2018-11-29 22:17:52 I dont know either but it was funny lol
983 2018-11-29 22:17:51 Well he does have a point - when an area sees a boom due to oil it does bring in a lot of “spare men” and the crime rates go up - but is it a gender issue? Or the fact that the men working these jobs have very low quality of life while at work?
984 2018-11-29 22:17:16 Chef Louis cut up some tinsel, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was his first born child, along with sushi.
985 2018-11-29 22:17:12 Dept of education  becsuse they dont educate they indoctrinate.  Dept of energy i remember when jimmy boy started it to get us off foreign oil, how did that billions work out?IRS, spiteful political hacks, flat tax =fair tax. 9th circuit court, break it up into regional justices
986 2018-11-29 22:16:51 Me:”you need an oil change or your car is going to blow up” 
Marcus: “I hope I’m in it when that bitch does” 
If this doesn’t sum up 2018, idk what does
987 2018-11-29 22:16:38 What are you missing in the strange behaviors of @JustinTrudeau?

Oil price disaster in Alberta.
GM shut down in Ontario.
Bombardier theft in Quebec.
#UNMigrationPact scam in Ottawa.
#USMCA failing.
National degradation.

Now "Swift " is being redeveloped by Banks in China/Russia /EU we are not held to ransom or sanctions by the USA

991 2018-11-29 22:16:24 Wonder if a tunnel like this could be used to make a pipeline deep underground from the Alberta Oil Sands to a sort of offshore docking station away from the bc coast?
992 2018-11-29 22:16:20 I take CBD oil but I think I need to take more!

996 2018-11-29 22:16:12 Check your Engine oil this Sunday.
997 2018-11-29 22:16:12 i’m grieving because i couldn’t put it down while i was cooking dinner last night and now the beautiful matte parts of the jacket are covered in olive oil fingerprints 
998 2018-11-29 22:16:07 I heard there was a scene where he gets motor oil sprayed all over his chest by a group of Decepticons. Cant wait!
999 2018-11-29 22:15:47 I love getting out of the shower and getting moisturized with my baby oil and Vaseline

[慣用句](香港やその他中華英語圏)
1.頑張れ

同じ意味を持つ中国語の慣用句「加油(jia you)」からの借用語。直訳ですね。「油を加える」→「頑張れ」。

1002 2018-11-29 22:15:06 if you are heading for an iceberg would you rather be in a lean nimble speedboat or a slow turning oil tanker? By no means am i a fan of this government but the ability to react to events fiscally means i would rather be out

1005 2018-11-29 22:14:45 In today's news release, Bonterra says that it has seen its realized oil price decline from C$77 per bbl to C$21.

Why in the world are they still paying a Monthly Dividend?!!

Their debt now exceeds their market cap and they are losing money on every barrel they produce! $bne.to
1006 2018-11-29 22:14:29 I have to agree. I think elon is being vilified in the media by big oil media shills. I mean, humans desperately need to change our reliance on fossil fuels like, 30 years ago. So I just don't get this.
1007 2018-11-29 22:14:25 Acne is a skin disease characterized by areas of inflammation caused by blocked pores. Bio‑Oil has been independently tested and found to be a non-comedogenic product, which means that it can be used without concern about further breakouts.
1008 2018-11-29 22:14:14 Cabbage, rutabaga (swede), beets and carrots. Olive oil, rice wine vinegar, hemp seeds and a bit of salt.
1009 2018-11-29 22:14:14 Since @lushcosmetics prefers Saudi oil I'll be buying Indian tear soap from now on.
1010 2018-11-29 22:14:12 That could absolutely be the case. I, actually hope it is, becasue that would at least lend credence or excuse to some of the decision that have reversed the direction of the Oil the last season or 2.
1011 2018-11-29 22:14:10 Truffles & Truffle Oil get you booted on CHOPPED every time. I don’t even want to think what should happen when they are used on a cheesesteak #shame
1012 2018-11-29 22:13:59 He uses chain oil. 
1013 2018-11-29 22:13:58 Almost 2 yrs gone & he is not only taking credit for the economy but now for U.S. oil production! What else is he going to take credit for in the future? I will rename him as the "Usurper in Chief". His arrogance has no bounds.
1014 2018-11-29 22:13:58 I remember Baldy, at the gas station up north, who used to scrub the bugs off our windshield with a corn cob. (Remember full service, including oil check?) 
1015 2018-11-29 22:13:45 I also use a little jojoba oil sometimes throughout the day!
1016 2018-11-29 22:13:40 I can eat corn tortilla chips but not in sunflower or palm oil. Those darn sensitive mast cells 
1017 2018-11-29 22:13:34 I call it!!!! Lol ..FYI My grandfather fight against the nazi's. But want would you know about that fighting for freedom the only war you fight is for oil money and pipelines ..I didn't expect anything intelligent to come from your reply and I was right
1018 2018-11-29 22:13:34 Electric vehicle sales increase 68% year over year. Prices will go down. Infrastructure is needed. Charging batteries from public utilities goes to health and education! Big Oil will not dominate world politics. Perhaps our planet may recover from the effects

1022 2018-11-29 22:13:08 Make a refinery in AB!! cut out the middle man and create jobs. Look at the economy of cities that have refineries in them. Why are we shipping out our oil to be refined and then buying it back!?
1023 2018-11-29 22:13:04 A big bar of Oreo Marabou chocolate is heavenly...oil rig gold currency.
1024 2018-11-29 22:12:50 Wait for q4/2018. #Tesla no longer loses money. And yes: corporate oil greased it’s way past electric cars a hundred years ago. I don’t claim that @elonmusk invented the BEV!
1025 2018-11-29 22:12:48 Just been sat with honey and coconut oil on my face for an hour and then washed my face with teatree... I feel your pain girl 
1026 2018-11-29 22:12:43 They’re still raising that fucking price on diesel even though oil is dropping
1027 2018-11-29 22:12:42 “Ooo is it an oil change?” My reaction when J tells me that one of my presents is for my car...

1029 2018-11-29 22:12:27 Saute green onions in olive oil and garlic until fragrant. Add chopped spam and hand-crushed san marzano tomatoes. Cook thoroughly. Serve with jasmine rice and a bit of Worcester sauce.

1031 2018-11-29 22:12:25 Behind many Travel Programs are Women making great things happen! Calling more women to Leadership! Unsure of your calling, find a Mentor (thnx u Jodi). As Monica stated, there are many good opportunities in the oil & gas industry! Women, you can influence change! #ERMHouston
1032 2018-11-29 22:12:24 I wonder how a rise in the oil price affected the Thundertank
1033 2018-11-29 22:12:22 You could help! If you organize a blockade to stop the oil coming into the country, why, you’d fix it all then and there! 

Because until you all stop using it, we’re going to keep producing it.

1034 2018-11-29 22:12:17 @NutellaGlobal do you use sustainable palm oil in Nutella?
1035 2018-11-29 22:12:11 Yes! Bio‑Oil helps to improve the appearance of new or old scars, whether from surgery, accidents, burns, scratches or conditions such as acne or chickenpox.

1038 2018-11-29 22:12:08 I like David, though annoyed he didn't follow our advice on his own house and put in a heat pump.

He ran a gas line to replace his oil furnace, in a mild climate PERFECT for ASHP.

To be fair, he's poor, and incentives were for gas, and HVAC guys there are hacks.
1039 2018-11-29 22:12:05 I loose to work in the oil, and mining industry. We were on the way of going bankrupt. Thank God for President Trump. For turning the industry around.
1040 2018-11-29 22:11:59 This is what's going down in my kitchen: Meatloaf, mash potatoes with olive oil/ chives, and brocolli

What's for dinner @ your house?
1041 2018-11-29 22:11:56 Not gonna lie, I'm worried when conventional wisdom says OPEC needs to cut big and $OIL isn't pricing in that they'll get it done
1042 2018-11-29 22:11:53 CBD oil solutions or thought cloud
1043 2018-11-29 22:11:52 Wow, heading into the elections @RachelNotley is really starting to care about Alberta oil. We have been in crisis since 2014 and now she's growing a backbone and sticking up to Ottawa. Wow, her pandering is so transparent. Would be hilarious if not so sad.
1044 2018-11-29 22:11:46 Liar,liar pants on fire! This is how describe the former President!  He admitted he hated fossil fuels! Obama did everything to stop oil and coal production.  And he wants credit for America’s oil production?  Does Obama really think we’re that stupid? Well, we’re not!
1045 2018-11-29 22:11:35 I just talked to my son, in commercial construction.  The disasterous oil price is reflected all the way down to subcontractor jobs being cancelled.

@RachelNotley ... what has your government done to manage this looming breakdown of functionality in #Alberta? Surpised?

#AbLeg
1046 2018-11-29 22:11:34 For years the oil people and @GasBuddy have said that gas is high in Nov. because of winter fuel being produced. Diesel high because home heating oil being produce so WTF.
1047 2018-11-29 22:11:29 The flavour of leave was never on the menu.

Farage and BoJo sold them succulent lamb basted in snake oil on a golden platter, as they sniggered and wrung their hands.

The snarling masses lapped it up.

What is being delivered is lettuce on toast, with no cake to have and eat.
1048 2018-11-29 22:11:26 Comme ça il a économisé du gaz oil ça devrait plaire au fils Juppé ....
1049 2018-11-29 22:11:23 Just change the oil and ring me up. I’m good on everything else. Damn. Oil changes are difficult.
1050 2018-11-29 22:11:16 I will make consideration for any essential oil or herbal supplement that has a valid double blind study behind it that has been reproduced. Feel free to rely with citations.
1051 2018-11-29 22:11:14 You will NOT rid the country of much needed oil, gas and coal.  Wind turbines and solar will always need a backup.
1052 2018-11-29 22:11:14 So happy i got my tired on my car and an oil change. Shes ready 
1053 2018-11-29 22:11:12 感想ありがとう、いいないいな！！

1056 2018-11-29 22:11:09 So I have the Take 5 Oil Change District Manager changing my oil right now lol
1057 2018-11-29 22:11:09 AWS:reinvent seems a bit tone-deaf on digital privacy. I don’t think “data is the new oil.” I shudder at that thought. Plus oil is a limited resource...data is not. Perhaps it should be...like precious metals
1058 2018-11-29 22:10:53 Total crude oil supply likely peaked in September. Existing data is backwards looking on a $25 YoY higher price. Currently production is lower while price lower $3 YoY.

Brent weakness likely due to US pushing out the massive September product inventory build.
1059 2018-11-29 22:10:33 Controlling the movement of what can be the world busiest shipping line is not just a local civil war if Iran proxies took full control and stopped oil tankers from passing oil prices will skyrocket
1060 2018-11-29 22:10:28 And every bit of ALL of it is over OIL So disgusting The saddest part is the suffering of innocents starving and dying over OIL The love of money IS the root of ALL evil

nayutaさんの歌声綺麗だった！
1062 2018-11-29 22:10:23 couldn't agree more.  the industry participants need to embrace the concept of capital discipline to live long enough to see some more good old days.  That + line 3 + one more thing (XL, NG, TM) might actually allow us to participate in the next oil rally.....maybe.

1068 2018-11-29 22:10:01 Alternative energy projects should be excluded from the passive activity loss rules under IRC Sec. 469 as are oil & gas interests.
1069 2018-11-29 22:09:51 Remember McKenna saying oil workers were a hazard to women? I can’t find any link to it on google! Why? I remember it even in the papers?
1070 2018-11-29 22:09:48 There are 5 articles on their website that are anti oil&gas
1071 2018-11-29 22:09:48 Be careful when you buy one though, Kento. An air fryer is different to an oilless fryer. The one pictured appears to be an airfryer but I was given an oilless fryer (where you cant use ANY oil) and it basically just bakes. Air fryers superheat the oil and actually DO fry.
1072 2018-11-29 22:09:47 Oil has been a losing proposition since 2014. That’s 4 years! Maybe it’s time to look for new jobs or is that the only thing that oil workers are qualified to do?
1073 2018-11-29 22:09:37 I was given 3 estimates for brake pad and rotor replacements all north of $600. Thanks to an honest guy at Express Oil Change and Tire, I found out the front ones still have 45% life left in them & the back rotors are more than fine until next time the pads are replaced. $209 
1074 2018-11-29 22:09:37 I'd die trying to execute my plan of getting to an oil derelict cause I have yet to get a helicopters license. I conservatively estimate 3 days after the start of the apocalypse.
1075 2018-11-29 22:09:35 You should also know that Governments play a role in the oil industry. Oil is speculative, but that’s not the only variables that apply.
1076 2018-11-29 22:09:29 fuck man being an adult is so expensive. i go i for an oil change and i got a nail in my tire.
1077 2018-11-29 22:09:29 She does have a point. I got 12 hr suspension for quoting a CNN contributor comment on CNN. Using Twitter standard, this makes CNN guilty of hate speech and inciting violence

1079 2018-11-29 22:09:15 In England we do not have prescribed cannabis at all. It’s illegal without exception.

There have been some recent cases in the news about cannabis oil, however. Which is different.
1080 2018-11-29 22:09:11 If you're buying Iraqi dinars you're going to get burned.
All fiat will die and each surviving currency will be revalued based upon the assets of the issuer.
Gold, silver, oil reserves etc.

Currencies like Zim and Iraq will likely be abandoned entirely.

1082 2018-11-29 22:08:57 Sometimes when you look around small paaaaa, look at Obuasi and compare to Johannesburg, look at Nigeria and compare to Qatar or Texas(State oo)or Russia. Look at us and our jubilee oil fields - WHERE DID WE PASS SEF AND WHERE DID WE GO WRONG?
1083 2018-11-29 22:08:47 From the early days of using wood, whale oil, to coal, petroleum and nuclear, each energy producing fuel brought its own environmental hazards. #renewableenergy(2/2)
1084 2018-11-29 22:08:44 The closeness of the SC1 election was definitely scary because I felt that (though I wasn't terribly optimistic) that if there was a chance Charleston would turn it was now because of Arrington's oil bollocks. There are people who voted for her just bc Trump tho
1085 2018-11-29 22:08:41 CBD oil helps me sleep through the night. I take gel capsules. Also helps with my aches and pains. Just a suggestion.  Several of my friend’s take an RX to help them sleep but I’d much rather do something natural. There are actually receptors in our brains for CBD. Good luck!
1086 2018-11-29 22:08:41 OBAMA is quite the joke! Taking credit for oil prices! Obama is the one who halted oil drilling in the Gulf, and would not allow Fracking or the pipe line! Total liar!
1087 2018-11-29 22:08:39 Well so far he’s pissed of the Oil Patch, the Auto industry, the farmers, hunters, small Business tax cheats, the Vets, most Premiers, now the Construction workers..who’s left??
1088 2018-11-29 22:08:25 Oil tank has split! To say I have no luck is an understatement, just filled it aswell! #fml
1089 2018-11-29 22:08:24 Went to get my oil change and tire rotation and i saw this dog laying down on one of the chairs so i go sit next to him but HOLY SHIT HE SMELLS SO BAD WTF I REGRET THIS
1090 2018-11-29 22:08:16 The price of oil is down and Wall Street say's it bad news. It's good news to everyone who isn't a Billionaire......
1091 2018-11-29 22:08:15 No not worth it, get a serum instead. just treat your eyelashes with vitamin e, coconut oil and castor oil every night or weekly.
1092 2018-11-29 22:08:07 Watched a young relative of the owner of the Thai restaurant  putting spoon after spoon of hot chilis in oil on their rice. I like hot and thought I thought the one spoon I put was more than most people could handle. Kid's arsehole must have been bionic.
1093 2018-11-29 22:07:57 Are your parents also climate change deniers? Because if you are still shilling for oil pipelines, you are a climate change denier.

1095 2018-11-29 22:07:31 Boiled in oil would be interesting...lol
Just kidding. She needs an exorcism!!! Maybe boycott where she buys her formaldehyde? 
1096 2018-11-29 22:07:30 These prices have been high for 2 weeks. .95 in Cornwall all week. !.00 in Morrisburg for 2 weeks. !.04 in Brockville today.....so there is gouging still. low oil prices help as well. Maybe dropping to absorb carbon tax hit in Jan...then start raising...just watch that.
1097 2018-11-29 22:07:24 Olive oil is the only essential oil. Every other oil is nonessential

1100 2018-11-29 22:06:56 that was a global issue. Corporate debt dwarfs 08 crash atm. Look at junk bond yields! Next crash is coming. Low oil prices will kill US banks who loaned to finance shale etc.
1101 2018-11-29 22:06:41 @RachelNotley PLEASE TELL ME WHY " ALBERTA OIL " IS NOT SUED FOR CANADIAN COMSUMPTION . OTHER COUNTRUES IN THE FAR EAST USE THEIR OIL DOMESTICALLY AND THE RESIDENTS PAY A LITTLE FOR THE FUEL

1103 2018-11-29 22:06:31 Y’all ever took an olive oil bath?
1104 2018-11-29 22:06:23 Obama was the biggest anti-oil president in history yet now he's taking credit for oil production. You can't make this stuff up.
1105 2018-11-29 22:06:10 Idk why I tagged you lol
1106 2018-11-29 22:06:05 Mr. President could you please look at what infrastructure is needed to refine American oil and become energy independent. We should not have to rely on other countries to cut supply to keep Americans working. Thank you sir
1107 2018-11-29 22:05:57 Robyn wasn't with me at the time.  It wasn't hard to maintain control.  The big black cloud of oil burning off was probably bothering the cars behind me more. Lol
1108 2018-11-29 22:05:54 You can put olive oil in your smoothies. Apprently it’s bad to cook. But so easy to put in smoothie and cannot taste it
1109 2018-11-29 22:05:53 I did so much today but my biggest achievement was putting castor oil on my hair, like that never happens
1110 2018-11-29 22:05:49 He is a friggin lier! So full of himself!He loves to pat himself on the back, when he full well knows the decreasing oil prices did not happen until now, under Pre Trump!
1111 2018-11-29 22:05:42 Hey you guys did you know coconut oil can whiten your teeth and fight gingivitis?
1112 2018-11-29 22:05:41 I’ve got a new oil for my face and it bloody smells of like soy sauce I’m so upset my face is like a California roll
1113 2018-11-29 22:05:35 A Premier between a rock and an oil patch. Don't envy her predicament whatsoever.
1114 2018-11-29 22:05:31 Yo so i got my fluids in my car filled for free, got my airs pumped without having to get out my car and my oil checked for me and topped off without having to stress about the car Thanks valvoline  i will continue to bring you guys a box of cookies for free service haha 
1115 2018-11-29 22:05:31 I wanted to fry some fish but I don’t have any oil :/
1116 2018-11-29 22:05:18 You obviously still don’t get it ... all you like to do is hurl melodramatic insults.  I never once said we could stop extracting oil or even that we should, not totally.  My point, whether you like it not, is unchanged ... is that we should try to reduce our dependence upon oil.
1117 2018-11-29 22:05:16 Lmfaooo I think ima buy some oil and put it in there 
1118 2018-11-29 22:05:07 Very funny bama boy hehehhe very funny . U producing Bama oil now
1119 2018-11-29 22:05:06 It hasn't come in yet. I went fully hippie and bought one that's a humidifier and diffuser so I can spread like... eucalyptus oil through the air too and feel fancy.
1120 2018-11-29 22:04:49 Norway, meanwhile, has long had a carbon tax on oil and gas, which it doubled last year. Petroleum production and natural gas extraction pay Norway’s highest rate of almost $72 per tonne. Check out how Norway is doing.

1122 2018-11-29 22:04:45 This is what I said in a May 15th tweet - "If oil prices begin to meaningfully subside at some point, it probably won't be because of a breakout of world peace.  It will be because currently higher prices induce more U.S. production . . . . #prediction
1123 2018-11-29 22:04:38 Interesting to see the TIPs really move on lower dollar, higher oil last couple days. Watching to see if it has staying power.
1124 2018-11-29 22:04:34 Tea Tree Essential oil helped rid my daughter of a collection of warts that developed on her chest & legs within a week. She has severe eczema which makes her susceptible to various skin infections. A dermatologist prescribed $100+/month cream that she'd have 2 use 4 over a year
1125 2018-11-29 22:04:24 i got some beard oil in the crib for you , so you can glo glo glo 
1126 2018-11-29 22:04:03 Coconut oil helped me the most!
1127 2018-11-29 22:03:57 @sunny You simply don’t care cause it hurts to know the truth about Obama cause you can’t handle the truth! By the way, Pinocho nose on Obama for saying thank you to him about the oil in America! Un imbecil!
1128 2018-11-29 22:03:56 Sec. 92(10) of the constitution (national interest clause) cannot be used to override sec. 35 (duty to consult). I'm pissed that we are importing Saudi oil because our gov's keep looking for shortcuts instead of doing the proper consultations, failed shortcuts kill projects
1129 2018-11-29 22:03:54 We are in the process of creating Gift Baskets & Care Packages, perfect for the holidays! Come by the shop for a selection of goodies for stocking stuffers like hand bath bombs, lip balms & soaps, Essential oil diffusion blends, herbal teas & more!
1130 2018-11-29 22:03:24 Palm is cheap. Rapeseed grows happily in cool temperate areas and is an alternative in foodstuffs but of course more expensive. For soaps castor oil (pricier but great).
1131 2018-11-29 22:03:21 fellow la residents please don’t be stupid and drive 20mph according to physics u just need to brake farther away bc the water and oil mixed decreases the friction between the wheel and ground thank u for coming to my ted talk
1132 2018-11-29 22:03:20 It’s a bit of both rail capacity is all but uses up cp/can have already said that increasing oil by rail means leaving grain  and other products behind.
1133 2018-11-29 22:03:19 This exact same time, the kingdom of God will be set up, as in 2016 he lit the candles in the church. Any who not worship Jesus, or worship false Gods, their candle will go completely out. Get oil in your lamp. Never let it go out.
1134 2018-11-29 22:03:16 Caught in trade crossfire, oil prices volatility and geopolitics, investors bludgeon Nigerian stocks; no news is good for the local bourse looking at the bottom of the barrel of -20% YTD
1135 2018-11-29 22:03:11 And once again the solution is not by nationalizing oil production and transportation
1136 2018-11-29 22:03:08 Make Oil and Gas great again!!! 
1137 2018-11-29 22:02:58 Debt is to keep cuts for high tax earners and if Scotland goes the oil goes with her - why else would wm be so desperate to keep us ?
1138 2018-11-29 22:02:54 Smoothies are a perfect way to get things in ur body that you never otherwise would. Or would take time to cook. For me everyday- spinach/kale, fruit, nut butter, cinnamon, olive oil, hemp seeds, sometimes avacado and oats 
1139 2018-11-29 22:02:47 The good news is that even if you lost the key, there's enough oil in the chicken that you'd be able to slip your cuffs.
1140 2018-11-29 22:02:34 全くその通りなんだよな
1141 2018-11-29 22:02:31 
1142 2018-11-29 22:02:27 I'm supposed to change the engine in mine, but I refuse. It's leaking coolant and oil, so I just don't put any in my car. Imma drive it til it dies, but seeing that it's a Toyota, it'll probably never die
1143 2018-11-29 22:02:24 Wow that is scary! Thanks for the clarification on why the color! I was thinking possible oil leak until I read the other replies! Stay safe! That road looked iffy btw.
1144 2018-11-29 22:02:19 台所で跳ねた油が私の足の裏について、他の部屋に広がったのかも。
I think the oil splashing in the kitchen might stack in my feet and spread over the floor in other room.
1145 2018-11-29 22:02:11 LMFAO I made cardboard and engine oil last night!
1146 2018-11-29 22:01:58 You think NASA is looking for oil or natural gas on Mars?  Why else would they be landing a ground sounding prob?  Just spitballing here.
1147 2018-11-29 22:01:55 I feel that so much, issa struggle over here too lmao! And yeah no worries! I’m also starting to get into meditation and essential oils and stuff so you should deff get some lavender essential oil. It’s so calming and helps me kinda re-center myself :)
1148 2018-11-29 22:01:50 I was 9 but I remember. We are in a much better place now. I just can’t believe our President just wants to go forward business as usual. It sends a very bad message in my opinion. You can do anything as long as you buy our arms and keep the oil flowing.
1149 2018-11-29 22:01:50 can’t forget the motor oil
1150 2018-11-29 22:01:50 Uefa and Fifa are corrupt 

Taking oil back handers from the Arabs
1151 2018-11-29 22:01:49 "They have crude oil, and essential oil." "That's good enough for me... BOMB THAT SUCKER!"
1152 2018-11-29 22:01:35 If you are an oil conspiracy theorist than perhaps you can appreciate that the US is now the world's largest energy producer thanks to hydraulic fracturing (which the left opposes) & that we are no longer as dependent upon mid eastern oil
1153 2018-11-29 22:01:34 My oil change is $40 somebody cash app that to me  $Candis28
1154 2018-11-29 22:01:30 I've worked many a french fry machine at restaurants over the years and you will enjoy your time there. Clothes get an oil smell so buy some Oxyclean. At least you get 50% of meals now. Good luck.
1155 2018-11-29 22:01:17 Deli Mojo Pork Sub on whole wheat, toasted, with muenster, dill pickles, oil & vinegar, and spicy mustard
1156 2018-11-29 22:01:12 I have been carrying around and applying peppermint essential oil whenever I have a headache or nausea and now I realize I have become my parents carrying around and applying tiger balm smfh
1157 2018-11-29 22:01:11 If you think oil is really dead - please go around your house a get rid of everything that has or uses any oil product or by-product
1158 2018-11-29 22:01:01 Essential oils are oils that carry the essence of a substance. Keeping the essence in an oil suspension in a state at which it can be imparted to the person, animal or thing to which it is applied. There can also be essential glycerin, with rose petals & jensiin violet petals

1160 2018-11-29 22:00:44 November 29, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1161 2018-11-29 22:00:38 Thanks .. It would be awesome to be able to let them out of the ponytail all the time , but with the oil it is not a good idea .. 
1162 2018-11-29 22:00:37 Crash in global oil prices – and Harper’s failure to build the Keystone XL pipeline – have injected uncertainty into the long-term future of Alberta’s vast carbon reserves because he refused to diversify.
1163 2018-11-29 22:00:34 Yes we can run scotland in electricity with wind and wave renewables - oil and gas for export purposes but we have more than energy we have fresh spring water whisky beef tourism - everything the rest of the world wants there is no need for wm to manage our affairs we grown ups

1165 2018-11-29 22:00:30 Every time he speaks, I get one of two visuals.  Either the Great and Powerful Oz being exposed behind his curtain or of the famous 'snake oil salesman' in front of his cart.  In both cases, all bluster fronting a lot of bullshit.  President Smoke & Mirrors!
1166 2018-11-29 22:00:30 Ναι, «για την Κύπρο» το κάνει ο Άντρος. 
1167 2018-11-29 22:00:29 おーっす！はよー！今日も頑張ろーぜ！
1168 2018-11-29 22:00:22 That's impressive, olive oil isn't usually the first ingredient in olive oil mayonnaise! 
1169 2018-11-29 22:00:20 What you need to do is get an oil change your STD results back and let me get these tweets and let me be a scum bag in peace
1170 2018-11-29 22:00:16 Whale Oil Beef Hooked!
1171 2018-11-29 22:00:14 Obama is a huge narcissistic!  For a person who stopped oil pipelines and prevented drilling for oil in various locations to now take credit for the oil boom is the height of chutzpah!
1172 2018-11-29 22:00:11 and when the sunlight hits the olive oil, don’t hesitate....
1173 2018-11-29 22:00:11 Mine are usually HUGE and last forever, but I felt one coming on Sunday and I’ve been tag-teaming it with abreva and tea tree oil and it’s 99% gone today already!
1174 2018-11-29 22:00:07 I remember a gallon o 2* for 75p plus a couple o squirts o 2 stroke oil. Me 1st peddle n pop.
1175 2018-11-29 22:00:03 Sis, thanks for the idea. Mixed Hungarymud with HL Oil in Lotion last night. My skin looks good this morning. Tapi tak tau la kot tu perasan lebih 
1176 2018-11-29 22:00:03 ふぁ……ありがとうございます……チビだけどいずれは守って欲しいって言って貰えるよう頑張りますね……(？)
1177 2018-11-29 22:00:02 Or just a higher grade of oil ‘product’ (I am sorry but I don’t know the proper industry names for those), one that is more easily/safely shipped by road, rail, pipe or boat.
1178 2018-11-29 21:59:44 i’m a simple bimbo. i put oil on my cuticles, i huff it
1179 2018-11-29 21:59:36 That’s funny!

My neighbors daughter, got impatient and try to drive away during oil change, without oil in the car…

she got mad that the guy working under the car was yelling at her
1180 2018-11-29 21:59:36 Jacques cousteau wrote that space launches use pineal oil of whales to lube rocket parts finest oil to use
1181 2018-11-29 21:59:35 Hate to say it but it's not just Scotland they don't answer.
Since Brexit means Brexit we have been expected to just toddle along and take catchphrases as policy.
Bunch of snake oil salesmen.
1182 2018-11-29 21:59:22 I am very happy for current oil price! What about you? I want further decrease of price for all natural resources! Maybe today's oil price will shake small amount of brain in our incompetent governors' head to develop Canadian manufacturing sector of economy!
1183 2018-11-29 21:59:08 Wtf 
1184 2018-11-29 21:59:03 Harper’s strategy was short-sighted, a strategy that was bound to fail and it was bound to fail because it was inevitable that oil prices would eventually go down, which is something that anybody who has lived in Alberta for the past 30 or 40 years could have told you
1185 2018-11-29 21:58:58 The purist in me wants to say it's all about the meat. Seasoning is great, but some folks use it as a crutch. What makes a great patty, I think, is capturing the flavour of the meat, and making sure it doesn't seep out with the oil, whatever else.
1186 2018-11-29 21:58:54 But often way too much of those things so that one day you’ll realize you have to throw away a gallon of expired olive oil.
1187 2018-11-29 21:58:53 Can you tell me where I can get CBD oil please ty
1188 2018-11-29 21:58:52 What an asshole!! The Federal Government had NOTHING to do with it! Especially Obama!
It was the individual States working with oil companies. All Obama ever did was GET IN THE WAY!!!
1189 2018-11-29 21:58:52 Did someone say already what the alternative would be if we stopped using palm oil?  Some products and foodstuffs might be dropped altogether,  but not all.
1190 2018-11-29 21:58:50 For the lips of an immoral woman are as sweet as honey,
    and her mouth is smoother than oil.
4 But in the end she is as bitter as poison,
    as dangerous as a double-edged sword.
5 Her feet go down to death;
    her steps lead straight to the grave
1191 2018-11-29 21:58:37 If you have a Tropical Smoothie near you go try the Cranberry Truffle, that shit oil! Won’t let you down!
1192 2018-11-29 21:58:36 His govt got money from Big Oil, in return, they embarked on major deregulation, when he left, he got hired by a law firm working with Big Oil. It's all about the money.

1195 2018-11-29 21:58:25 今日のおやつは抜きです！
1196 2018-11-29 21:58:18 Do you also abstain from using indoor plumbing and electricity, since things 150 yrs ago were so great? I'm all for respecting past accomplishments, but a LOT of what ppl believed in the past was hogwash, and a LOT of "homeopathy" is placebo-based, snake oil hokum .
1197 2018-11-29 21:58:14 Plus rockets need fuel and oil both of which mine resources that are not sustainable
1198 2018-11-29 21:58:13 My entire being smells of coconut oil and no im not giving any context to that statement
1199 2018-11-29 21:57:59 くっそねみ…！
おはようございます〜〜
1200 2018-11-29 21:57:50 Wish I had CBD oil on me right now to calm my nerves.
1201 2018-11-29 21:57:30 I’m sooooo late but I hear peppermint oil works wonders! I wasn’t pregnant but I used it last year when a coworker was pregnant and it cleared up pretty fast.
1202 2018-11-29 21:57:28 Oil producer largest. Saudis and Nigerians are laughing
1203 2018-11-29 21:56:59 I've had turnip fries before. Tastes the same as french fries to me since it's all the same oil, salt and grease flavor. And beer can be replaced with dry hard cider. BOOM! 
1204 2018-11-29 21:56:58 i love my therapist so much she gave me a bunch of essential oil samples
1205 2018-11-29 21:56:58 You every think about the impending oil crisis and how little is being done to try and stop it
1206 2018-11-29 21:56:47 Russia will be even closer!  They will take over the melting Arctic, with their ships and whatever else they want to lay claim to up there - oil?
1207 2018-11-29 21:56:34 NEB did a fine job...issue is foreign interference in our industry and politicized process. We cannot get anything energy related built in Canada and more C-69 adds to the problem. How do we import Saudi oil on diesel tankers with no regulation yet cannot expand an existing
1208 2018-11-29 21:56:26 S/o to my parents for coming to pick up my car at work to take it & get an oil change for me

1210 2018-11-29 21:56:17 I wonder how many different GIFs can be found of oil leaks, oil fires, etc one could find and post?

1213 2018-11-29 21:55:59 I don't apply it everyday on my skin tho. I mix it with a carrier oil like Lavender and i noticed so far that it has improved my overall skin health
1214 2018-11-29 21:55:55 They also discovered new oil - sent all the rug guys home and told us oil had ran out - we now have two new oil fields with another 59 yrs oil and 1 trillion cubic ft of gas discovered 2 months ago - and they tell us wm subsidies Scotland 
1215 2018-11-29 21:55:54 Stockholm Syndrome. We (in Alta) had Conservative gov'ts for 43+ yrs. The Cons looked after themselves, Oligarchs & friends but damn the mid-class if they need services. They blew thru our Savings (from oil) like no tomorrow! But don't let some other Party come in & govern fairly
1216 2018-11-29 21:55:40 Clove oil- tastes disgusting but that’s what they’ll recommend
1217 2018-11-29 21:55:30 @realDonaldTrump, how are falling oil prices a good thing for the oilfield? Many dedicated workers are still hurting for employment opportunities. Improving prices provided a #huge chance to get back to pursuing our dreams. I trust you have our best interests at heart! #MAGA
1218 2018-11-29 21:55:21 And the recipes will be converted to soybean oil and other garbage.
1219 2018-11-29 21:55:21 I love this one. Usually the stories about "soldier comes home & surprises fill-in-the-blank who then collapses in tears of traumatic relief" make me angry. Why are we sending so many people off to die & kill for oil, why are separating them from their partners, kids, pets?
1220 2018-11-29 21:55:20 写真の構図を借りたとはいえ私の絵柄じゃないこのらむだ
1221 2018-11-29 21:55:19 This is your daily reminder of a booming economy. Steel and oil workers back to work and generally a positive direction after O damn near destroyed the U.S. #Maga #blexitmovement #walkaway
1222 2018-11-29 21:55:17 Researchers have created a way to convert plastic bottle waste into ultralight polyethylene terephthalate aerogels for a variety of useful applications, like heat and sound insulation, oil spill cleaning, carbon dioxide absorption, as well as fire safety applications. …
1223 2018-11-29 21:55:13 It was a direct result of state programs and the oil industry in the face of constant opposition and increased regulation from the corrupt Obama regime! Instead for taking credit Obama should STFU!
1224 2018-11-29 21:54:58 The problem is she is trying to sell the Emporers new clothes. 26 pages of waffle and aspiration. She is no snake oil merchant either. She could make the Mona Lisa sound worthless.
1225 2018-11-29 21:54:50 Pretty impressive, James. They hope to go to market late 2020 starting at $69,000. Getting closer & future looks bright, but all sensible folks would agree that Oil&Gas Vehicles will still be required for many many years yet. Not to mention jet fuel, furnaces,Transport Rigs,etc.

1230 2018-11-29 21:54:09 Your talking about the Obama statement, right?
Where he was all in on oil production and he intiated it.
1231 2018-11-29 21:54:08 I know the government got some type of teleportation device ...can y’all sell it to the general public with regulations of course ...but then again y’all like making money off of oil 
1232 2018-11-29 21:54:02 Use tea tree oil!!! It gets rid of them VERY quickly!! Apply several times a day and they’ll be gone in no time 
1233 2018-11-29 21:54:02 Chicken brines over night. Rinse. Pat dry. Rolled in seasoned flour, then into the oil. That’s it. The results are magical. #saintscooking
1234 2018-11-29 21:53:52 The “Trump Tower Moscow” deal ended in June ‘16 bc they made a NEW deal. Get Trump elected (and rich) in exchange for favorable treatment (oil $$) of Russia. Keep up, people! There’s the collusion!
1235 2018-11-29 21:53:52 Good thing I made it to meineke, the damn oil light was on.
1236 2018-11-29 21:53:51 Time to put a huge tariff on imported oil - say $75/bbl US

1238 2018-11-29 21:53:42 OIL discovery in Zimbabwe so says the government of ED . Lets not forget that that some time back  The same ZANU PF government discovered purified diesel in Chinhoyi through a witchdoctor! musanyepegwa, zvorema, vaperegwa!
1239 2018-11-29 21:53:32 Oil change completed, sorry for delay. Favourite is too hard to pick, but my current jam on repeat is Nobody Knows by the Lumineers
1240 2018-11-29 21:53:22 Youre awesome, thank you, yes, that's why. I love the feral kitties and will not see them be cold, wet, or suffer. I also have heat lamps and oil heaters burning for them to snuggle under/by. You should see my electric bill.
1241 2018-11-29 21:53:17 Anything good that happened to US oil and gas industry during the Obama administration happened in spite of, not because of, Obama.
1242 2018-11-29 21:53:14 Also confirmed by REXXON for Sec of State,a man connecting RUSSIAN OIL to DT, easy to guess “promise to lift RUS sanctions(+a % of oil profits/Rosneft/Page/Papad?)& we’ll GET YOU ELECTED” as Quid Pro Quo, now we’re getting the proof to our conjecture #Illegitimate45 #ImpeachNOW
1243 2018-11-29 21:53:09 I’ve been craving seafood for the past week but I also have an appointment for an oil change so decisions decisions #adulting
1244 2018-11-29 21:53:08 These subsidies numbers are misleading.  The vast majority of those "subsidies" are CDE & CEE, which just allow producers to deduct the cost of drilling oil & gas wells.  Just like every single other industry in Canada deducts the capital they spend to generate income.
1245 2018-11-29 21:53:06 When you are in a store and a pungent smell assaults your nose, it's probably essential oil.
1246 2018-11-29 21:53:02 And I mix my oil. Veg oil is my base. But I cleared out my back stock adding leftover oil from bacon, smoked sausage, chorizo and ham fat (leftover from a stock). #saintscooking
1247 2018-11-29 21:52:43 Let me schedule an appointment to get my damn oil changed 
1248 2018-11-29 21:52:27 We are still buying millions in Saudi oil every month... Canada could do way more to punish the Saudis.

Keep up your fight Bill!!!
1249 2018-11-29 21:52:19 Sore?! Magnisum oil!! A must!! Tingles when it’s working...  Esp.for pregnant cramping legs!
1250 2018-11-29 21:52:17 how about I like big guns big trucks big homes because matches my big dick? 
1251 2018-11-29 21:52:15 When I let my hair breathe for too long my scalp act bougie when I’m trying to wear protective styles like sis you never act like this I massage and oil you all the time let me be great gosh darnit 
1252 2018-11-29 21:52:11 That can happen if it gets cold!! Kinda like how wood cracks and expands or retracts or whatever when it gets cold, tires do something similar. You can go to like an oil place and usually they’ll do the tire pressure free
1253 2018-11-29 21:52:04 Though I WILL say... Everything I've ever used is at least edible. None of this motor oil business up in this bitch.
1254 2018-11-29 21:52:03 泣いてしまう
1255 2018-11-29 21:51:44 use tree tea oil!
1256 2018-11-29 21:51:42 Um, hate to tell you, but they were there all along. Groomed for Trump's heist of the American democracy by TV evangelists. They will go back to throwing quarters at the snake oil hucksters.
1257 2018-11-29 21:51:38 Yeah, he did EVERYTHING he could to kep this country oil dependent and weakened..all under the BS guise of preventing Global Warming and preserving the enviorment.
1258 2018-11-29 21:51:35 That’s my problem.  When people do try to make scientific counter points, they are dismissed as republicans, science deniers, or in the pockets of the oil companies.  When you argue your points and dismiss counter points and insult people making them.  Your argument is wrong
1259 2018-11-29 21:51:33 Lol. Pimples comes from Oil. I hear
1260 2018-11-29 21:51:30 okay so hindi good match ang palmolive at hot oil haha okay next.
1261 2018-11-29 21:51:20 Hussein Obama actually created a booming oil & natural gas industry after he left office. His limiting drilling and exploration caused Big oil and gas suppliers to wake up to his insideous plan & under Trump, we now have a surplus instead of a crisis. Obama was Soros's puppet.
.
1262 2018-11-29 21:51:09 Surely olive oil itself?
1263 2018-11-29 21:51:05 Tough gig. But you're not seriously telling me the oil rigs are paying less than nurses?
1264 2018-11-29 21:50:43 “Her breath smells like shit, like oil” @Kelldawg
1265 2018-11-29 21:50:36 Excellent
1266 2018-11-29 21:50:35 We have a niche product, that can’t possibly supply all of Canada with fuel/gasoline, without crazy amounts of byproduct/waste/extra-cost. We should really get out of the fuel market, and corner the post-fuel/oil market needs. Composites/plastics, asphalts, and other byproducts.
1267 2018-11-29 21:50:24 Need to get an alignment, rotation and probably an oil change. Any fairly priced recommendations in Charlotte? #charlotte #mechanic #charlottemechanic
1268 2018-11-29 21:50:18 What the f..k does it means? 100 million for snake oil?
1269 2018-11-29 21:50:09 @TeamCavuto hey when gas prices stay low everyone gets a raise. Keep them low then you may not ave to raise the wages. If transportation costs stay low then that affects everything else. Maybe oil shouldn’t be traded in the market
1270 2018-11-29 21:49:54 That oil money looks so good
1271 2018-11-29 21:49:49 *sees pancakes*

me: MOTOR OIL!!!!!!
1272 2018-11-29 21:49:47 Dust, dirt, grime, grease, oil and i ate enough sand to shit bricks.
Our outdoor showers looked like a big swing set frame with shower heads across the top.  Line up, dick to asshole
I STILL appreciate how good a real shower feels.
1273 2018-11-29 21:49:47 Been after a some oil can you recommend where you purchased thanks
1274 2018-11-29 21:49:41 stack of pancakes : h-
twitter : i think we ALL know that’s motor oil 
1275 2018-11-29 21:49:40 I often wonder how many people take it to mean 'needed'* without realising it's just the *essence* from something, in oil.

*I think advertisers have relied on this ignorance somewhat 
1276 2018-11-29 21:49:36 Looks like a historically large spread between the seasons.. been wondering if it’s driven by fundamentals or by the recent oil/natgas stop out
1277 2018-11-29 21:49:34 The density of oil is much lighter than density of water . Not the opposite. As they are injecting water not to replace oil but to force oil to go up . @ashwaqalmudhaf .
1278 2018-11-29 21:49:32 Well,seems Obie, no one can know me 44,is shedding his slimy political snake skin! He’s turning into a flip,flopper. First,oil gas coal are demon energies he punished! Now he credits himself with their resurrection. Delusional comes to my mind.
1279 2018-11-29 21:49:28 The price of oil is down about 15 to $20 a barrel, 203 there for the gas prices aren't staying stable, it's about $2 a gallon here on average

1284 2018-11-29 21:48:54 Oil below $50 a barrel yet, we in Bay County have the highest prices per gallon in all of the Southeast. It’s been 6 weeks since Michael. You can’t blame it on that. It’s all about GREED. Stop!!

1286 2018-11-29 21:48:29 @SenWarren: "And you have to stir it up really good to get the stuff on the bottom mixed with the nuts and oil on top."
1287 2018-11-29 21:48:18 It wouldn’t matter how much a Trudeau led government did for Alberta; they will not acknowledge that help and will always feel it wasn’t enough. They seem to be in either perpetual victim or superiority mode, depending on the oil flow.
1288 2018-11-29 21:48:17 @BarackObama you didn’t do crap about the oil, you sat on your Muslim a$$ and took away from people
1289 2018-11-29 21:48:13 @BarackObama  Mr EX President you can demand credit all you want for the economy and oil prices BUT YOU DONT DESERVE IT AND YOU WONT GET IT.... Thanks @POTUS President Donald Trump for that
1290 2018-11-29 21:48:13 Just remember. STO's oil is still cheaper for the government!
1291 2018-11-29 21:48:09 didnt they pour hot oil or tar in the medieval days?
1292 2018-11-29 21:48:05 Or you could go to a doctor's and get some proper antidepressants rather than rubbing some oil on your skin
1293 2018-11-29 21:47:49 @squalllive Oil below $50 a barrel yet, we in Bay County have the highest prices per gallon in all of the Southeast. It’s been 6 weeks since Michael. You can’t blame it on that. It’s all about GREED. Stop!!
1294 2018-11-29 21:47:48 CNY is "fully convertible" under oil contract.  That plus CNY gold can be used to do exactly what you note.
1295 2018-11-29 21:47:45 Hmm, too much oil on your hands can have that effect...
1296 2018-11-29 21:47:43 I recall at the downturn Harper shrugged his shoulders and stated, "Oil is only 10% of the GDP" , actually it's only around 6.8 %, threw AB under the bus and walked away, that's exactly what you could expect from Scheer, ranting and lying never solved a problem.
1297 2018-11-29 21:47:42 Frankincense oil took away my laugh lines. No wonder this oil is revered as holy.
1298 2018-11-29 21:47:36 At what point with the Canadian government show real backbone and cancel the LAV export deal? Surely there are other options for this manufacturing capability. Perhaps build train engines to haul AB oil? (People from London will get that...) #cdnpoli
1299 2018-11-29 21:47:23 Screwed up the french fries when they stopped frying in beef tallow and switched to vegetable oil.
1300 2018-11-29 21:47:12 I appreciate your vote to discharge the Yemen War Powers Resolution from committee  There is only one big reason for us to be cozy with #SaudiArabia #Oil Our planet depends on us converting to green energy. Human rights violators should be sanctioned & isolated. #KhashoggiMurder
1301 2018-11-29 21:47:07 Sorry. Got rid of my previous tweets due to typos making it nonsensical. What I was meaning to say, was that I don't have faith in the WWF, who are hypocrites for saying they oppose canned hunting, yet support 'sport hunting' wildlife for mega $ in S Africa. 
Palm oil kills too.
1302 2018-11-29 21:47:06 Because they have to. Especially when oil trades some 30 dollars below your break even
1303 2018-11-29 21:46:42 ONLY TWO DAYS IN NOVEMBER LEFT TO ORDER CBD OIL OR CREAM .. PURCHASE TO ENTER MY DRAW .. WHO IS IN .. MESSAGE ME OR COMMENT
1304 2018-11-29 21:46:35 I think u should be stating “confidence in politicians” since history has shown reps being cancerous from both sides! By the way, u may want to research what oil’ Feinstein & her hubby have been involved w/ & then think about where ur confidence lies
1305 2018-11-29 21:46:27 The point of Advertising is to grab the audience attention. Why shouldn't they make it look appealing? It's not like when you buy the product it tastes like motor oil, shaving cream, or glue. You already know what you're buying since these are commonly bought items by consumers.
1306 2018-11-29 21:46:27 A drop of pure and natural extra virgin olive oil is an amazing moisturizer for your skin and won’t clog pores!

1314 2018-11-29 21:45:45 No one has the faintest idea how to make any sense of this far out aliens way of taking your country and putting in in another galaxy without a vote like normal ways that happen in Canada, it happens because we have oil and the world wants to control a great wealth like that easy
1315 2018-11-29 21:45:44 Better take a look at present investment estimates.  It's all renewables.  Oil/gas are moving there because they still want to be in business and receive investments, have good PR, and be able to attract new employees.  Alberta can join in on this, having #2 in wind (after Nfld)
1316 2018-11-29 21:45:44 We've done it but very little oil. God loved two peoples: Israel and the only Catholic country in our half of the globe and to both He gave absolutely no oil to spare them the temptations that go with it.
1317 2018-11-29 21:45:39 they taking forever with this oil change
1318 2018-11-29 21:45:34 I’ve heard it’s dying a slow death. Retail took a hit in the oil slump and hasn’t recovered
1319 2018-11-29 21:45:29 I get told that because it's been so hot and dry, oil comes up from the tar in the roads from other cars previously. It makes it extremely slippery. Mad times kappa

1339 2018-11-29 21:43:05 I disagree Kim. It is absolutely an ‘England versus Scotland’ thing.

1357 2018-11-29 21:41:14 His predictions are irrelevant,  using Al Gore and saying he flies in a jet and millions he makes is one man. More oil and natural gas companies pay out lobbyists and along with scientists that are not part of a consensus that can not be backed by any proof or be replicated.

1359 2018-11-29 21:41:06 The science of oil is geology. Geologist study the history of the earth. They will laugh in your in face about climatology. These guys practice a science that produces locations to drill or they lose their job. Climatologists make outlandish predictions w/o any accountability.
1360 2018-11-29 21:41:02 I knew about it, I've been in the oil and gas industry since 2000, and have been told that it was a bit of an old boys club. No expertise, just connections.
1361 2018-11-29 21:40:57 @RachelNotley if you truly were here to do YOUR very best for #Alberta, first youd drop the Fed #CarbonTax, and fight like a caged tiger yo get our oil to the Markets at a $$ value the same as all other oil producer.

1370 2018-11-29 21:39:57 HAHAHAH para matunaw yung mga fats and oil sa ugat HAHAH
1371 2018-11-29 21:39:50 @L_MacAulay @AndrewScheer @MichelleRempel With focus on GM, Francophone, Border, O&G pipeline and ridiculous notion that NDP entering Oil Tanker business. The AG Grain Industry in danger with Elevator buyer Monopoly, impossible to sell production, move by rail to create cash flow
1372 2018-11-29 21:39:50 @jkenney it is too bad UR oil clueless&biased oil prices R controlled by the US to wit: US$problem is/was AB oil put their 'eggs' in 1 basket US instead of sharing with CANADIANS (we import 56% oil why??) shld have been resolved under Lougheed & Klein instead.........
1373 2018-11-29 21:39:45 Fridays when his kids are gone and Orange Hairpiece lies, Mitch Mcconnell dies a slow emotional death
1374 2018-11-29 21:39:42 Nope. Oil coal, and energy companies.
1375 2018-11-29 21:39:39 What @#$%&^ if it was for him America would be 100% able to supply there own oil. We probably has gas under $2 for the last 3 or 4 years flirting $1.50 today.
1376 2018-11-29 21:39:37 Those of us in America with even a small amount of brains know this. Too bad the residents of Dumbassistan have not yet sobered up from drinking the orange snake oil!!!
1377 2018-11-29 21:39:35 They tell you to put them on before prayer to be more in tune with God.  I dont need oil for that.
1378 2018-11-29 21:39:23 The ironic part of them protesting the pipeline is that their own business and industry would not even exist if it where not for oil production. How daft can people get these days.
1379 2018-11-29 21:39:22 Boy I’ve been sleeping on this beard oil I got  
1380 2018-11-29 21:39:20 Inspired by a conversation with a friend, I would like to do a photo essay called “Young People Nowadays Just Don’t...”

It would be made up of images of 20-35 year olds home cooking, changing their oil, and just generally working hard.
1381 2018-11-29 21:39:15 Well this week has been pretty rough but also the mice are convinced I'm the best hoomin in the world for:
- Making a giant maze/ soft  play gym (aka 2 balled up blankets) on my bed.
- Feeding them frozen peas. 
- Using tasty, tasty coconut oil on my hand eczema.
1382 2018-11-29 21:39:12 Too bad he doesn’t own any in Lucas Oil Stadium.
1383 2018-11-29 21:39:08 Weird how everyone has suddenly stopped talking about palm oil already
1384 2018-11-29 21:39:06 Coconut oil and soap!!
1385 2018-11-29 21:39:04 I advocate for both. Example: peppermint oil takes the edge off of my migraines.  But medication like imitrex and anti-epileptic meds arw the only way I can get rid of and prevent migraines.
1386 2018-11-29 21:38:59 I oil, balm, & use a boar’s brush.

I didn’t Style it before snapping the photo

1388 2018-11-29 21:38:30 Agree, but watches aren’t snake oil
1389 2018-11-29 21:38:19 Looks like an oil painting that is totally beautiful.  If the the need is for beauty then the greed is unconscionable.
1390 2018-11-29 21:38:19 My car had no oil in it, I’m so glad iwasnt being lazy and actually checked it when my car was sounding funny 
1391 2018-11-29 21:38:18 The US became the #1  producer DESPITE Obama. Oil production did rise significantly during his terms, but he did everything he could to slow production. Pres Trump on the other hand helped the industries through deregulation & opening up more of the gulf to drilling. More even!
1392 2018-11-29 21:38:01 I started using an essential oil diffuser in my office today (a Cyber Monday purchase) and LET ME TELL YOU this is the best thing ever like w o w.
1393 2018-11-29 21:37:39 wow, putting coconut oil on my eyebrows is the best thing to happen to them. they just needed more love than they were getting
1394 2018-11-29 21:37:38 3. And most importantly,  you must know that Niger Republic is selling oil to Nigeria cheaper, very cheaper  than what Nigériens consumers pay
1395 2018-11-29 21:37:38 Esqueci de comprar o corretivo oil free eu sou muito burra vai se fode
1396 2018-11-29 21:37:33 The Permian wildcatters will be the end of Nigeria last last till our government decide to have sense and move away from reliance on oil revenues
1397 2018-11-29 21:37:32 “You sounded a bit rushed, and what’s that thing on your face?” referencing a cute lil pimple that came to visit... thanks mum well aware I’m not an oil painting but whose fault is this?
1398 2018-11-29 21:37:29 i smell like fryer oil, in a cute way :)
1399 2018-11-29 21:37:23 RT to WIN! Dermalogica Precleanse Balm is a deep cleansing balm-to-oil formula that melts away makeup, oil and debris from the skin. Today we're giving away 3 tubes along with the handy face mitt!
1400 2018-11-29 21:37:23 He did everything to stop oil production the states are the ones that pushed ahead with oil production
1401 2018-11-29 21:36:47 Baby oil.
1402 2018-11-29 21:36:45 But hey, we’re for ending all lame govt spending. No more vote buying programs like welfare, bank bailouts, oil cleanups, food stamps, etc
1403 2018-11-29 21:36:33 Yes because gas always goes down when oil does....
1404 2018-11-29 21:36:28 Roast that shit in the oven. You can just put a bunch of veggies on a pan and put olive oil salt and pepper on them and put them in the oven for like 10 minutes at 400 degrees and they turn out  Smoothies and juices are easy and delicious too!
1405 2018-11-29 21:36:25 lmfaooo i told him to get some tanning oil 
1406 2018-11-29 21:36:19 You suggested to reduce oil production at one hand and blame NDP rail plan not swift enough on the other hand. You contradict yourself and can’t make any sense as always. It seems you #UCP will blame NDP for anything like Donald Trump to Obama to get elected.
1407 2018-11-29 21:36:12 why are there no Take 5’s in broward -____- literally been at the auto shop for 45 minutes for a damn oil change.
1408 2018-11-29 21:36:10 It could be Placebo affect Josh but CBD oil (orally,THC Free) helped me a lot with my Fibromyalgia and my PTSD symptoms. Keep us updated if you find a good supplement combo that works for that.
1409 2018-11-29 21:36:04 that's where I got my numbers so far, but what they present needs further analysis - how much of the "labor" category is DEFENSE labor? There's oil, too.
1410 2018-11-29 21:35:58 yes!! pls keep explicitly calling out deception! but while you’re at it, maybe call out the deceptive practices in our own party? how many reps are ignoring the pressing urgency of climate change bc of oil industry $$ ? we all see 45 is doing it for oil money— dems shouldn’t be!
1411 2018-11-29 21:35:55 I agree it was not Obama, it was Trump, since Shale Oil had not sold as much as it has lately.  That and Saudi Arabia was not producing as much. Obama is more like a figure head during his time in office, stirring the pot rather than cooling it or outright emptying it of trouble.
1412 2018-11-29 21:35:54 おはよういってきます
1413 2018-11-29 21:35:46 I use coconut oil all over my whole damn ass body even my hair n that shit is good

From our Stock News Alerts App
1415 2018-11-29 21:35:34 I immediately stopped reading the above article when they said the West suppresses the price of oil. LOL. Oil comes out of the ground at a price of $15 bucks as cost of production. It hasn't traded for that price in 20 years. Gold 1500 and Oil 15 would actually be fair.
1416 2018-11-29 21:35:33 I went to primary school are the tail end of post-war austerity. We had cod liver oil tablets at playtime, with the free school milk. Vitamin D - helps prevent rickets. It was a disease that pretty much disappeared.
And now it's back.
1417 2018-11-29 21:35:24 The stock market plunges further, bourse continues to extend losses amidst crude oil price crash plus anticipated slow growth in the global economy. We’re now at a YTD of -19. 96%
Really not a year for stocks
1418 2018-11-29 21:35:20 2. Nigeria is a big economy and any oil shortage  will harm businesses seriously.  Insuring other oil supply sources is therefore necessary to prevent shortages caused sabotage of pipelines.
1419 2018-11-29 21:35:19 There is a forehead oil print mark (we all know the one) on my plane window rn and I ran out of @TheWET_ones wipes and I could cry
1420 2018-11-29 21:35:10 I havent smoked my herbs since Friday night esteban got me oil cartridge and i dont like it
1421 2018-11-29 21:35:09 Waiting on this oil change is blowing me
1422 2018-11-29 21:35:04  I’m literally an aircraft mechanic, you got me fucked up if you think I’m putting WATER in the oil system of my “amerikkka baby killing” jet. Water won’t stop corrosion/prevent the wear and tear of metal against metal. That’s not “big govt” that’s science. Water will oxidize.
1423 2018-11-29 21:35:03 They're gonna find 53 things that need to be done just because my oil is getting changed.
1424 2018-11-29 21:35:02 And yet you signed the exports permits for the LAVs for the Saudi Praetorian's to use against their own people, AND you create regulatory barriers against Cdn oil producers that could displace Saudi conflict oil. Your govt is full of virtue signalling hypocrites.
1425 2018-11-29 21:34:49 Communicating truth to the masses is noble; selling snake oil violates
"first do no harm".
1426 2018-11-29 21:34:45 $51 dollars a Barrel for oil , 
Saudis ok 
Russia ok
USA fracking need $ 80/90 a barrel  because of costs who is paying the 
29 dollar subsidy the USA Tax payer .
UK need $80/90 a barrel 
so who is making the subsidy Yes you guessed it the UK Tax payer 
how are we viable
1427 2018-11-29 21:34:45 hwo is olive oil only worth one coin it should be at least 2
1428 2018-11-29 21:34:35 We will always need oil. Why is it always all or nothing with O&G shills?
1429 2018-11-29 21:34:35 Real Wages = Nominal Wages / Prices Level, if prices rise, because of Saudi Arabia's oil, a milk shortage, printing money, whatever: your real wages go down unless your employer gives you an equivalent raise. 

This is the market over time, no above market value here.
1430 2018-11-29 21:34:24 Thank you President of Shell Oil company we’re bringing forward the truth.
1431 2018-11-29 21:34:24 **At oil change garage**
**Man hands me clip board and pen*
**Asks me to turn on car while writing*
**Placed pen in mouth to free hand to get keys**

Brain: “SPIT THAT OUT YOU MORON WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU!?”
1432 2018-11-29 21:34:16 Obummers Iran deal almost put an end to this industry. $24 a barrel when Iran started dumping oil on the market
1433 2018-11-29 21:34:16 Lol, what a bunch of two faced people you NDP are. First you spend three years crippling the oil industry and now you expect Albertans to believe you support it.
1434 2018-11-29 21:34:03 Oil production under BHO was on the increase due to regulations from the Bush Admin , which occurred onprivate land. Natural gas production was actually on the decline on Federal Land. But most of all can someone say Shale Oil? His Ego is Sky High

1436 2018-11-29 21:33:33 Or it could be because socialism doesn't work

The government force businesses to submit to them or leave

The wealthy were able to escape and the government never diverse there economy 

They relied heavily on money from oil until the prices tanked
1437 2018-11-29 21:33:27 What guns you can own 
What you do for a living
1438 2018-11-29 21:33:20 Instead of oil pipelines, we should have water pipelines.
1439 2018-11-29 21:32:57 Man there goes the discount on shoe insoles and suntan oil!
1440 2018-11-29 21:32:56 Oil is abundant and cheap at first look. Taking into account the price future generations will have to pay for our excessive burning of fossil fuel, it’s incredibly expensive. #ClimateChange
1441 2018-11-29 21:32:54 Because he actually accomplished quite a few of Russia’s goals. 

 1: remove arctic protections for oil and gas drilling (Kara sea and Rosneft thank you, Comrade Trump.)

2: ram through keystone and DAPL 

3: shutter sanctions office, muse about giving 3 Russian compounds back
1442 2018-11-29 21:32:49 There isnt the energy on the planet to process plants to oil then to plastic, this is why we use fossil fuels they're efficient and have massive free energy reserves
1443 2018-11-29 21:32:47 #OIL: We expect that OPEC will announce a output cut of between 1.0–1.5 MMbpd when the producer group meets in Vienna next week, 'prompting a rationalisation of overstretched bearish positioning and bringing WTI back into the low $60s through the end of the year' @scotiabank
1444 2018-11-29 21:32:41 Hey Alex - glad you asked! Presidio Stay Clear is a bit tougher all around - it prevents yellowing caused by oil absorption in addition to UV rays, and is 8-foot drop tested.
1445 2018-11-29 21:32:34 do you have any tanning oil ??
1446 2018-11-29 21:32:31 There's something weirdly comforting about the way the wild growth hair oil smells
1447 2018-11-29 21:32:27 I once knew a man who had been in a wheelchair since the age of 14.
Throughout the 80s, he survived 6 layoffs at the oil company where he worked.
His teen son asked him, "Dad, did they keep you bc of the chair?"
He said, "I don't know ... but hey, whatever works!"
1448 2018-11-29 21:32:22 Naaah~ we’re just a bunch of kids who talk about sustainability and how much palm oil contained inside Nutella but still consume it because we have no other options inside the fridge, what a lyfe.. -metro this morning
1449 2018-11-29 21:32:12 Then there must be a drug interaction caution about mineral oil in every/any statin label, right?
1450 2018-11-29 21:32:10 Yeah I had gone with my brother to get an oil change and I seen him there 
1451 2018-11-29 21:31:58 Malulungkot lang ako lalo

1454 2018-11-29 21:31:33 People who want America to stop drilling and miming for gas, oil & coal, should give up driving, hearing& cooling their homes! Thus saving the planet! 
1455 2018-11-29 21:31:20 Bro.. I remember when we first mixed the ape juice with the oil. Eureka moment. 
1456 2018-11-29 21:31:08 The stretch marks you got from this reach need some Bio oil
1457 2018-11-29 21:31:01 Your post is biased on political purposes. Here are few things you should. 
1. Nigeria is importing refined oil from Niger Republic. Why ? Because pipelines are regularly sabotaged in southern Nigeria and this cuts crude oil supply to Nigerians refineries.
1458 2018-11-29 21:31:01 Remember McKenna calling oil workers that?
1459 2018-11-29 21:31:00 Drun

1463 2018-11-29 21:30:41 When the worker’s labor generates wealth but the boss keeps most of it, and doesn’t even give the worker enough to live on, that is redistribution. When the taxpayers have to pay for unnecessary military contracts, bank bailouts, oil cleanups, etc, that is redistribution.
1464 2018-11-29 21:30:36 Yup, closely followed by oil industrial complex
1465 2018-11-29 21:30:36 Pretty sure your main business is drilling for oil and selling it. Get off my timeline. That's the business that has funded your promotional tweets. KThxbye.
1466 2018-11-29 21:30:32 And finally, anyone telling you that behaving a certain way keeps a man faithful is peddling snake oil. It is not our job to playact at a marriage to keep a man faithful. It is our commitment, however, to treat our partner with respect and kindness and honesty. That's it. 3/End

1473 2018-11-29 21:30:03 they have hella snacks here at the dealership...guess what i’m doing while getting my oil changed

1478 2018-11-29 21:29:06 My daily anxiety reminds me that it's real.
1479 2018-11-29 21:29:03 Wasn’t Obummer the one who stopped drilling offshore & even defied a Federal Judge who ruled oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico could continue to operate after the Horizon Oil leak? Wasn’t it Obummer who stopped oil pipelines from being built?
1480 2018-11-29 21:28:50 I literally went back to look the shit up because you got me fucked up right now. Go learn where oil comes from then come talk to me. Cause I don’t think it works how you think it works.
1481 2018-11-29 21:28:45 Thank you Sir:  It was awkward from the get go.  We were not confident.  The many back and forth's were obviously not working.  40% of imported oil for the US comes from Canada. All the minerals in the world and water.  Then there is lumber.  Am not sure what to say. D.
1482 2018-11-29 21:28:32 Oil prices HAVE ALWAYS BEEN LOW FOR CANADIAN SELECT!!! Albertans need to go back to the provincial government that WORKS for Alberta. NDP it ain't!!
1483 2018-11-29 21:28:31 I'm moderately optimistic at this point, the oil price is very low, the sanctions are eroding Russia Gdp, the Russian army is costly overstretched in too many regions and Putin's popularity is fading inside and outside Russia, this is the "El Alamein" moment of out times
1484 2018-11-29 21:28:31 According to Shell Oil, Obama created sanctions that went from 60-80 to 600-800, so he blocked progress at every level. The growth during his years came from states, not by the deeds of his presidency.
1485 2018-11-29 21:28:23 This is the cleanest balance sheet on an oil and gas co! Get your facts straight bud lol deep dive in there, exploration increased 35,000 on Quebec and 78,000 stock compensation on options exercised lol
1486 2018-11-29 21:28:21 Wow! What a novel idea but Easter Canada has already said that they don’t want Canadian oil!

1488 2018-11-29 21:28:08 Well his statement buisness leaders need to wake up and move on seems to be working for him. Many oil rigs and now auto sector companies have or are moving to USA! For the rest of his statement he really has a hate on for men. He is the one who assaulted a women!
1489 2018-11-29 21:28:03 It’s too expensive to bring the high tech work to US.  Americans are paying the tariffs.

1499 2018-11-29 21:26:46 he is afraid of construction workers, oil workers, and defense workers but really likes female reporters.
1500 2018-11-29 21:26:45 Good then put your money where your mouth is.  Put 100 billion into whatever industry you think should take over the spot of oil and gas and let's see what happens.  You can't stimulate business with high taxes and bureacracy, we're not even set up to welcome new industry.
1501 2018-11-29 21:26:44 In other words short cycle oil production is not as easy as it is being suggested and in fact could be more problematic for a company than long cycle projects which take the rough with the smooth.
1502 2018-11-29 21:26:37 Look, aside from being paid by the Koch Bros I don’t consider myself some oil apologist. But the idea that Tesla could have gotten where they are today without billions in subsidies is a farce. The idea that Tesla’s subsidies “level the playing field” with oil is absurd.

1503 2018-11-29 21:26:29 I know it’s all about the “oil”, but the US should not be allied with ANY country that subjugates women to second class citizen or slave status!
1504 2018-11-29 21:26:18 I’d rather drink motor oil than Einstein’s coffee
1505 2018-11-29 21:26:10 Dumplings and pirogies are best steamed and a then a lil pan fried (not boiled and not immersed in a tub of oil) 

Youre welcome!!
1506 2018-11-29 21:26:09 I feel you, mine is too. Just use oil when you’re untwisting it

1510 2018-11-29 21:25:43 So, r u saying that the US didn’t become #1 during Obama’s terms? Well we did! So if he was fighting oil or NG production, how did that happen!? He was never against oil production, he just pushed alternate green forms of energy! There r facts and then ur “alternative facts”!
1511 2018-11-29 21:25:42 Lying Barak Obama, EXPOSED...Former President Of Shell Oil Company Mr. John Hofmeister. Said FACTS ARE FACTS...
1512 2018-11-29 21:25:32 According to the numerous articles out there this problem is self inflicted by a # of oil companies & facilitated by the conservatives. Poor business decisions suck!
1513 2018-11-29 21:25:16 The growing competition among the bourgeois, or for about a week until the soap has absorbed the oil.
1514 2018-11-29 21:25:09 "We" don't sell any oil. Oil companies sell oil.
The oil line will be built, if only to get us to 2030. Converting the entire economy will take that long.
Yes there is a planned 4$billion LNG project in the works, and a $5 billion hydro plant in the works.
Alberta will benefit.
1515 2018-11-29 21:25:09 $Oil price is'nt more about production or demand, its about robots price manipulation as should be halted by supervisers.
1516 2018-11-29 21:24:59 How bout taking democracy to venlezela!  People are starving there!  Take it, take over oil!  No more stinky Indians that kill American s  and go about there business!
1517 2018-11-29 21:24:55   So I've been informed, anyway. I'll just have to wait and see.

Leveling ships has never been /too/ bad for me. If I've got the spare oil, I'll send them on that 10 Hour mission that gives them buttloads of EXP.

Passive Dorm EXP is really helpful, too.

1521 2018-11-29 21:24:34 I talk about my home country and have lived in the US long enough to have understand your mindset to a certain degree. But oil subsidies are what’s keeping ICE powered cars alive. That, and people being used to loud stinking cars. Enron was a fraud. Nothing more.

1527 2018-11-29 21:23:45 The ultimate flaw in the "logic" behind developing more Tar Sands oil, more Tar Sands pipeline to deliver it, is that we just don't have time to fart around anymore.

And this *is* farting around, coddling a dinosaur industry for sake of "value extraction" that we can't afford.

1535 2018-11-29 21:23:24 Obama did everything he could to hurt the oil industry. It's not surprising that he thinks that all Americans are fools.
1536 2018-11-29 21:23:20 Yesssss!!! I LOVE this stuff. I make my own hair oil, bf's beard products, asthma remedies, etc. If I ever do, youre the first person I will let know!!!

1547 2018-11-29 21:22:12 It's one cause, but "inflation" is really describing the rising price level. So when Saudi Arabia increase oil prices that causes almost all our goods to increase in price (because everything is transported or made with oil) even if no money has been printed.
1548 2018-11-29 21:22:07 You guys think I can shine my leather shoes with olive oil?

1550 2018-11-29 21:22:01 OK then if we don’t boycott palm oil then demand will actually increase if only due to our current unsustainable population growth. (Over 200 000 more people worldwide every day). This will increase prices & corrupt govs will continue to allow forest clearing.

1553 2018-11-29 21:21:40 That’s fine & dandy but until there is an alternative we need the Oil & Gas industry. If you don’t agree...stop flying, driving, heating your homes & do your part!
1554 2018-11-29 21:21:37 The government bought a frigging oil pipeline to support the oil and gas sector for pity’s sake.
1555 2018-11-29 21:21:31 Why?  Because he deals with OPEC?  or because he wants the better oil for America?  There are others, the price is set by OPEC, but sadie oil is the purest...so what's the who treason thing about?
1556 2018-11-29 21:21:28 Olive oil is absolutely necessary to me. So therefore it is an oil that is essential.

1562 2018-11-29 21:20:37 Because all, or almost all of the growth anyway, came on private land that the federal government doesn't control. On federal land oil production either declined a little bit or was completely flat during his presidency.

1607 2018-11-29 21:15:26 It's even worse than you imagine. Thankful I don't live there any more. To top it off, there is so much oil baked into the roads from all the dry months that the fools who don't realize they need to slow down early are in even more trouble when they hit their brakes last minute.

1616 2018-11-29 21:14:40 Alberta oil is dirty requiring gazillions of water (much never to be recovered), chemicals and a lot of energy to get out of the ground. Any pipeline that could be built will not be ready for 20 years when there will be no market for Cdn oil.  We have a climate crisis. 2/

1626 2018-11-29 21:14:03 Courage takes many forms. Frankly you don't have a clue what you are talking about. The only iron fist I see at play is the USA who wants to break up Syria and Iraq for the sake of oil and now gunning for Iran.

1632 2018-11-29 21:13:07 No thank you! 
I won't eat your chocolate until you change to palm oil from companies that do not destroy the rainforest, killing all wildlife in it & destroying the lungs of our planet. And why can't you make real chocolate? Since when does real chocolate have palm oil in it?

1634 2018-11-29 21:13:02 ok that is correct but eventually Dinosaurs fossils will also become coal, oil and natural gas. So the student is right on principal.

1652 2018-11-29 21:11:27 So, is Saudi oil flowing as a thank you to @POTUS for letting them off the hook for murder, or are they just bleeding the other suppliers for a while? I like the gas prices, but one has to wonder.
1653 2018-11-29 21:11:20 Oil biz is a dumpster fire but AB has second strongest economy in Canada. AB seems fine with tar sands decline.

1660 2018-11-29 21:10:58 So under your leadership, you've become a Globalist, not Albertain  I'm not sure, anyone how saw the writing on the wall would allow all possible outcomes. Why did you shutdown Energy East? Canadian buying canadian oil!
1661 2018-11-29 21:10:48 Olive oil is pretty essential to me. Foes that qualify?
1662 2018-11-29 21:10:46 Lavender oil, this is a letter to you.
You should know, how dearly I yearn for your mollifying presence. In your absence the tension refuses to cave. The moment you infuse your essence with my senses I glide over pandemonium, qualm free.
1663 2018-11-29 21:10:35 Great chart. Thank you. Oil made clear higher low and higher high post 2014 until this sell off. Not so easy to see for CAD.
1664 2018-11-29 21:10:27 False. Subsidies aren’t going to be needed. The subsidies in Germany have been in place for a while: still hardly anyone bought a #Tesla or other make. People will buy them only for being superior. And don’t even get me started about subsidies on oil etc.

1669 2018-11-29 21:09:55 Stop with this PC madness. We need to stop all imports from Saudi Arabia including oil.
1670 2018-11-29 21:09:52 @SenToomey we don't need to sell #SaudiArabia weapons and we don't need their oil. Remember how great that weapons deal with #Afghanistan turned out for us? What we need is a #Congress  with the #courage to be the #checksandbalances that the #Constitution requires
1671 2018-11-29 21:09:52 The victims should take heed more because they are the one succeptible and it's simple enough. You are dating a guy who is not working working in an oil and gas, engineering or runs a shipping line. Remember I didn't add banking. His family is not rich and he drives a Benz...

1674 2018-11-29 21:09:41 Ah the self-proclaimed King of All Fossil Fuels @BarackObama just can't get enough of hearing himself talk. Ultra friendly Rice crowd laughed and applauded his boast of being responsible for US oil production prominence. So much for the environment
1675 2018-11-29 21:09:40 They are, but they're SO GOOD ON TOAST WITH TOMATOES AND OLIVE OIL AND SALT AND PEPPER THOUGH

1681 2018-11-29 21:08:43 Maybe the best oil painting advice I've heard this year from @dossantos_art. Paraphrasing here, but "just paint with paint." We spend so much time and effort getting just the right paints from amazing manufacturers. Why feel pressured to chase so many additives and mediums? 1/2
1682 2018-11-29 21:08:41 I think "Essential Oil" is a female dog whistle... Hmmm did that come out right...?
1683 2018-11-29 21:08:37 Elizabeth Warren -- Americans... have been burned enough timea on tax deals that carefully protect the tender fannies of billionaires and big oil and other big political donars, while working families just get hammered.
1684 2018-11-29 21:08:17 are you talking about the farmers that have to get bailed out because of trumps tariffs or big oil /big pharma/big auto that get corporate welfare??
1685 2018-11-29 21:08:13 I have no skin in this never voted Tory in my life and voted remain.
No responsible Parliament will allow WTO. I am sorry for you that you are not blaming the charlatans, snake oil salesman and liars that brought us to this. They promised all things to all men and delivered none
1686 2018-11-29 21:08:06 My foot  advice is to use cuticle oil. It softens the skins and keeps your nails looking great x

1689 2018-11-29 21:07:43 Yeah he developed a poorly-timed fear of the car last week after we hit the rumble strip for a second on the highway... (he’s a sensitive, timid boy ) But we’ve been giving him CBD oil and it seems to have helped him be less anxious in the car today!
1690 2018-11-29 21:07:37 it's time you stfu we don't depend on a bunch of spoiled brats on anything. We aren't responsible for oil prices and the fact that it's discounted in the market that it's sold to has not one iota to due with the feds. nothing. They don't bargain, set or regulate prices.
1691 2018-11-29 21:07:32 never until this deal gets done. Exxon Mobil stands to regain access to huge reserves of oil if the United States rolls back sanctions on Russia. 12/12/2016.
1692 2018-11-29 21:07:28 Scheer asked for the meeting!! I agree with you that this is a non issue. Get the oil flowing- have a meeting about that!
1693 2018-11-29 21:07:27 Yeah, exactly like my phone - planned obsolescence. Current "environmentalists" only complain about oil, gas & cows, yet Microsoft has a hand in writing enviro-policy, so mining is never mentioned. Its all about taking land disguised as "protection". #ICLEI #Rockefeller #LandGrab
1694 2018-11-29 21:07:22 Don't worry, I hear you can barely even taste the fish oil when you burp.
1695 2018-11-29 21:07:15 I have no idea what an essential oil is but it must be pretty essential if it's called essential oil

I am currently waiting to be tasked a ship for when we 'grab the oil'.
1699 2018-11-29 21:06:40 Not to mention his signature is on the bill the that lifted the 40 year ban on oil exports. That was one of the last things he did to really piss me off.

1704 2018-11-29 21:06:18 Thank you for these recommendations 

ive been using an aztec mask (1-2 per wk)and vitamin C serum but I havent used tea tree oil. I dont regularly steam my face...

*whispers back* even tho I have a steamer.

Note to self: use your steamer & steam your face!
1705 2018-11-29 21:06:03 You have no idea what you’re talking about. Go check out how many countries we are bombing currently. The only thing we are protecting is oil and our weapons industry
1706 2018-11-29 21:06:01 It would’ve destroyed us when the figures quoted in the white paper were with oil included. That’s been openly admitted now, then you can add in the near £14bn deficit. You might like paying huge taxes to pay for services but I don’t.

Thanks for the technology yes. 

Phuc you for the coming oil hangover.
1708 2018-11-29 21:05:53 Get you a best friend that does your oil change and lays in bed and watches South Park with you
1709 2018-11-29 21:05:53 But we still buy their oil?
1710 2018-11-29 21:05:51 Some have violent fantasies against their opponents too. It can be a little unsettling.
1711 2018-11-29 21:05:30 An oligarchy? A kleptocracy? They have a ton of money coming in from oil revenues that never seems to leave the pockets of the rulers and top 1%. That's not socialism.
1712 2018-11-29 21:05:14 anyway
i got lyrica and i have the option of getting medical marijuana. i might just get cbd oil bc high cbd strains are what help and it’s a lot cheaper

1715 2018-11-29 21:04:54 It’s ridiculous to compare the hostile invasion and war in middle-eastern countries where we had an ulterior motive (oil) to this completely different situation.
1716 2018-11-29 21:04:51 Well, I made a mistake! I waited too long to reorder my CBD oil. Stiff and achy today.
I will never do that again!

1719 2018-11-29 21:04:45 Funny. Generations ago we only lived til 40. Weather was great. 

Now we live til 90 and climate change will kill us all?

Nope. 

Maybe buy land 50ft above seawater. 

Maybe co2ppm will be 1,000ppm  in 32-200 years. 

=no ice

The oil hangover is thrown upon future generations

1726 2018-11-29 21:04:24 I work on a ship in the offshore oil industry. What I remember is your over-regulation causing it to be too expensive for companies to produce in the downturn. Result = thousands laid off, including me. You didn't do crap for the oil industry, except try to kill it.
1727 2018-11-29 21:04:15 Why are you guys not bringing up the UN compact on mass migration that Trudeau will sign next month? This is very very bad for canada, even worse than the issues of oil, and the gm plant shutting down! This needs to be addressed asap!
1728 2018-11-29 21:04:13 I won't exchange a word with a vile person cos I know you have clothed yourself with curse like a garment, so  it will come into ur bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.

1731 2018-11-29 21:04:01 oil execs please choke
1732 2018-11-29 21:03:56 Sorry - still missing the point. Climate change is a real & present danger. Building more oil capacity does not help the fight against #climatechange. The argument to access profits does not trump (sorry) the costs of climate change. #abpoli
1733 2018-11-29 21:03:46 I got muscular dystrophy and I use Cool Azul essentials oil lotions for muscle pain more than I do Tylenol. It works wonders.
1734 2018-11-29 21:03:41 Sentiment? Oil down, inflation slowing, earnings slowing, GDP slowing. Markets down from all-time highs. Commodities wrecked. I could go on. But a couple of tweets about a "great meeting with the wonderful Mr. Commie leader" will fix it.

1754 2018-11-29 21:01:59 I would find it a bit comical. But rich folks getting tax breaks buying products that are bad for the environment from a snake oil salesman...
Well it isn't real funny.

1756 2018-11-29 21:01:51 So happy for you, Cousin! You deserve it! PS: You're not changing MY oil, are you? Jethro? 
1757 2018-11-29 21:01:48 No, but you can greatly reduce the necessity for oil in the production/transportation processes. Even still, are the current needs for fossil fuels to produce that greatly offset their carbon footprint currently.
1758 2018-11-29 21:01:39 Always and always us leads  world to bloody brutual wars to gain the income of oil in the name of humanity they  divide countries and people to lead  with no rules and no  one says no .
1759 2018-11-29 21:01:38 I swear, no walmart ever has their shit together.... been waiting for 2 hours just about for a simple oil change... 
1760 2018-11-29 21:01:37 CANADIANS: Do not be fooled by Gerald's bravado. Canada produces only 1.5% of ALL world emissions. Eliminate oil and gas; put us all in caves; add a carbon tax of $1,000/ton - you will still not even notice a difference! None! This is another phony @JustinTrudeau argument!
1761 2018-11-29 21:01:35 The game is afoot. Greed is a bitch. Build a Hotel in Moscow, Russia. Recieve 10% share of value, Rosneft Oil Company, one time fee. Oil field find worth $100's of billions. Lose U get hotel. Win,get rid of Magnitsky Act. That is the Art of The Deal. Plus Russia owns your ass.

1763 2018-11-29 21:01:24 I think its as important to cut off the oil we buy from them. The money supports Wahabism around the world.

1765 2018-11-29 21:01:19 So usually you get a Registrar to take your file to that magistrate with your request to be heard on the bail application.

You apply 'nigerian oil' to that process....

Magistrate may refuse though since he didn't make the remand order the previous day or doesn't want to work
1766 2018-11-29 21:01:06 I empathize! Spent years without realizing that migraines weren't normal headaches or pain levels. Recently got a pres. of Sumatriptan, working well so far. Peppermint oil on the neck, temples (avoid anywhere near the eyes!!) relieves some tension/nausea & is pleasantly cooling.
1767 2018-11-29 21:01:02 Agree. CBD oil is non-psychoactive, helps with pain, depression, anxiety and even fights cancer.
1768 2018-11-29 21:01:01 this is like when we had to do a "how to" speech in my class and everyone did stuff like "how to change oil" or "how to make a sandwich" and i did "how to survive a zombie apocalypse"
1769 2018-11-29 21:00:53 She destroyed Libya, stole its oil and killed the libyan president.
1770 2018-11-29 21:00:53 Oh nice... Your beard is nice as well... You use oil or it's a natural self treatment? Oh your palms are nice as well... Nice manicured toenails as well
1771 2018-11-29 21:00:49 um...Oil.. its the economic engine of the entire country
1772 2018-11-29 21:00:47 This guarantees the Americans as the only customer, thus the huge discount. They can now buy oil $35/bbl cheaper,  than they sell their own for. It’s brilliant since their refineries need heavy grade crude and can’t use their own to make fuel and energy needs
1773 2018-11-29 21:00:46 Whip together 9 oz haiku roll with 11 lbs beer. Sprinkle with Olive Oil. Freeze for 9 hours. Serve warm.
1774 2018-11-29 21:00:46 Yes, by stalling pipelines and not allowing drilling in Alaska he miraculously increased oil exploration. Look up bullshit and see his picture.
1775 2018-11-29 21:00:40 Since they didn't have electric light, daresay Paul would have thought candles or oil lamps a very good idea.

1779 2018-11-29 21:00:31 Coconut oil is very healthy. It is high in special fats called medium chain triglycerides, which are metabolized differently than other fats
1780 2018-11-29 21:00:31 reduce exposures into vol events outside your control...but at least the market goes into this low on expectations for any real meat on the bone...The oil element could cause a bigger move, especially if Putin serves the link between Trumps desire to have low crude and his

1783 2018-11-29 21:00:22 Never toss out kimchi juice. I just marinated steamed vegetables in some for like an hour with sesame oil and soy sauce, it was effing delicious.
1784 2018-11-29 21:00:21 I’m not with you here.  Real wage growth should rise in a very tight labor market, but the transmission mechanism to inflation is simply not there. 1970s inflation caused by very high labor force growth (raising aggregate demand) while Fed hikes and oil tightness limited capacity
1785 2018-11-29 21:00:19 All I want for Christmas is a Georgian-era oil painting of myself 
1786 2018-11-29 21:00:14 Even Harvard and Yale lawyers and economists became loyal to oil companies. The solution, of course is to ignore the lawyers and economists. Simply choose a scapegoat oil company, and prohibit from doing business. Then the non-scapegoats would complete to be the most responsible.
1787 2018-11-29 21:00:13 I wonder how to interpret IEA  “assessments” on red meat/sugar/ oil / gambling / HS2 and what that tells us about who funds you?
1788 2018-11-29 21:00:13 Multifrontal challenges geopolitically speaking for Venezuela in terms of oil and gas emerging players and re changing energy patterns in the Caribbean on the path to renewables adding the growing expansion of the U.S. exports to the region..
1789 2018-11-29 21:00:12 Ladies, just a reminder to check ya engine oil and tire pressure.
1790 2018-11-29 21:00:02 Hemp oil is high in omegas and when combined with ozone it forms an oxygen-rich, water-resistant, honey like consistency. It’s 3:1 ratio of Omega-6 and Omega-3 fatty acids are believed to help reduce acne, eczema, and psoriasis symptoms.
1791 2018-11-29 20:59:54 Well some one should tell him he is correct, obviously barak lives in a dream world of high finance and oil riches, thats fine. The rest of us peasants down below have to live in reality.
1792 2018-11-29 20:59:44 I’m at break masters by myself to get an oil change BY MYSELF send help@
1793 2018-11-29 20:59:41 In case folks don't already know this, Qatar is a hub for our clandestine ops within the Mid-East including but not limited to terror cells. Ton of crazy stuff happens in that tiny little country drunk off oil.
1794 2018-11-29 20:59:36 I made a BOMB facial oil and body oil (with fresh rose petals) I’m obsessed and lemme tell you, everyone needs it
1795 2018-11-29 20:59:34 Motor oil?
1796 2018-11-29 20:59:33 For Russia it’s about the oil when you look at it that way. 10 million barrels per day gets sold in USD not RUB.
1797 2018-11-29 20:59:32 You can make oil from electricity?
1798 2018-11-29 20:59:25 I once hears the analogy turning a primary school around is like turning a yacht... turning a secondary school is like turning an oil tanker... true or not... discussion point maybe
1799 2018-11-29 20:59:21 IMHO. All about the dollar.  Part of Argentina deal with Chinese so they can lower rates. Your dreaming if you don’t think the strong dollar played a role in his decision to blink.  

Now the Chinese will buy our oil and soybeans and Trump will postpone the Jan tariffs
1800 2018-11-29 20:59:15 So how does that work in practice. As you know last week I suggested oil blimps or rebranding WCS as WCS IPA, so the crazier the idea the better
1801 2018-11-29 20:59:10 It blows me away that people will pay double, triple the price for ESSENTIAL OIL from a clear scam company vs just going to Whole Foods or the Co-op and getting real certified organic oils. Like-who buys this shit? I don’t get it.
1802 2018-11-29 20:58:58 M. Macron once quipped that French taxation was making France, Cuba without the sunshine. 
Brexit will make UK, Norway without oil and gas (and fewer ships and fish but this is another story)
1803 2018-11-29 20:58:52 Omggg and then eating it with palm oil and pepper

1806 2018-11-29 20:58:27 i need to lather my body in coconut oil. 
1807 2018-11-29 20:58:13 @paulmichaeleary you are my freaking hero! You're my 1000th follower! DING! DING! DING!DING!DING!DING!DING!DING!I'm having a beer! This oil change can wait 10 minutes! 
1808 2018-11-29 20:58:03 PUTIN says he is fine with $60 barrel Oil. U.S., ought to be too!  Frackers indignant and irate.  Sixty Dollar Oil is fine with the American People!  Sixty 
dollar oil will be OK, then.
1809 2018-11-29 20:57:49 Big Oil Bot right here ^
1810 2018-11-29 20:57:41 So glad you said it. It's something I've known all my life. No one understands how much oil and grime and gunk from cars build up on our streets. It's crazy.
1811 2018-11-29 20:57:40 This be some oil drilling pipe
1812 2018-11-29 20:57:39 Topped with motor oil and dish soap
1813 2018-11-29 20:57:38 God what a snore all of you #TrumpCult #MAGA addicts have become. Like huckster anointing oil, it is as though you've sold a 3 page vocabulary document to the lazy and dumb, and you've restricted all communication to the limits therein.
1814 2018-11-29 20:57:29 Ben that’s not nice! My oil is 100% organic.
1815 2018-11-29 20:57:26 My car needs 
- oil change 
- new brakes/discs 
- new tires

And I still haven’t gotten my last two checks from FedEx and it’s been 2 weeks
1816 2018-11-29 20:57:24 Let me get this straight. We invade a country with oil, but gas costs more? That dont make no freaking sense! 
Now I didn't go to no fancy school or nothing, but Ill tell you this right now -- if I invade Kentucky Fried Chicken, wings will be cheap at my house.

1818 2018-11-29 20:57:05 I love it. A decade ago a moon base sounded insane to the general public. The oil and gas companies were assured of their unchanging dominance. Now we are looking to the stars, driving electric cars, thinking about going to mars
1819 2018-11-29 20:57:04 My co-w said "I cook AND clean" so I asked him if he smelled like onion rings. He responded by asking me if I smelled like spritz & baby oil........ how do I revoke his black card?

1822 2018-11-29 20:56:24 As a company gets bigger, it’s employees get less productive. They have more time to devote to building loyalty to the company. Oil companies got so huge that their loyalty building employees started to convince non-employee voters to be loyal. :::::

1824 2018-11-29 20:56:17 This was supposed to be the Spark to ignite The War on Terror.
A geopolitical plan to capture oil and nature gas to provide Europe, shutting out Russia from the european market.
Just as Vietnam the only people earning cash is The US Elite bankers and some politicians. The 1%+6%
1825 2018-11-29 20:56:15 I have been saying it for years. The American’s were brilliant, with their energy strategy and ensuring a cheap oil and energy supply. Fund anti pipeline groups to prevent your largest supplier and future competitor from getting a pipeline.
1826 2018-11-29 20:56:11 I’m SHOCKED to learn that billionaires influence opinion. I denounce the evils of BIG OIL
1827 2018-11-29 20:56:05 Lmao
1828 2018-11-29 20:56:05 What Obama? He just about ruined the oil industry. Remember his war on fossil fuel...I remember.
1829 2018-11-29 20:56:04 The use of blackcurrant drinks ('blood of Jesus') and olive oil in our churches today is worrisome.
1830 2018-11-29 20:56:00 BITCH I SAID AN OIL CHANGE WHY YALL KEEP RECOMMENDING ME SHIT I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THIS MEANS BITCH
1831 2018-11-29 20:55:55 I don´t want any  fracking- gas or -oil!
1832 2018-11-29 20:55:55 that's because it's an oil painting!
1833 2018-11-29 20:55:48 I literally smell good because I got an amazing perfume Oil from VAMS SCENT. If you wanna smell good? Or you've been trying to use a couple of things to smell good but it's not working? Just buy from her @annie_vams and she's affordable.
1834 2018-11-29 20:55:48 I got a pitch for interviews with a so-called esports expert (who is obviously NOT an esports expert.) Should I, A., delete like I would with any other awful pitch? or B. Tweet 9-10 times about esports snake oil salesmen?
1835 2018-11-29 20:55:45 Lol don’t feel bad, I need an oil change....we know how that goes  actually eff it, imma go next week!

1839 2018-11-29 20:55:38 If you want greener innovation, you need to open up opportunities for companies, not clench then shut with endless, redundant regulations.
Oil and gas will always be used for SOMETHING, even if its use and demand does decrease over time.
1840 2018-11-29 20:55:38 Anyone else force fed Omega3/Fish Oil tablets as a kid?
1841 2018-11-29 20:55:28 Not all of Europe is dependent on buying Oil -in Denmark we usually produce enough for ourselves otherwise we buy from Norway who produce a lot-sometimes we even produce a little extra to sell
1842 2018-11-29 20:55:28 FINALLY got my CBD oil in so now my anxiety can get the hell out of here.
1843 2018-11-29 20:55:23 I’d say very likely.
I can’t imagine burning pretty much anything not being a criminal offence by 2030 pretty much anywhere.
Let’s face it, Info-tech will and is completely ignoring Trump and will carry on regardless crushing coal, oil and the legacy car industry.
1844 2018-11-29 20:55:23 Buying a French car used is always a bit of a gamble. Espacily all the Citroëns that used the horrible BMW VTi petrol engines. BMW themselves only used them for a short time because they are more oil than petrol but Citroën stuck to them for quite a while.
1845 2018-11-29 20:55:10 but the real life actual things he is doing prove we are NOT doing anything helpful to Russia, quite the opposite...
*oil-our own independence AND convincing Germany to switch OFF OF Russian oil
*our fierce defense of Ukraine ALREADY, & supporting their missile defense systems
1846 2018-11-29 20:55:04 How much of this is to supply the Vancouver market and how much is Canadian oil shipped to WA to be processed for our market? @GasBuddyDan

1848 2018-11-29 20:54:57 Also Suriname has discovered not that significant oil but also means another challenge right close to Venezuela.. so much for the future of petrocaribe..
1849 2018-11-29 20:54:46 It wasnt trump. Few of the big time oil makers made an excessive amount of oil and now its way to much oil in the world. they had to lower prices dramatically to sell more oil.
1850 2018-11-29 20:54:42 True, and I agree with the start of the oil boom starting before Obama, but you’re also talking about people who are free thinkers. One that doesn’t always agree with everything they say or do. No I’m talking about the ones who agrees with everything...
1851 2018-11-29 20:54:32 So what he is saying is let the whites find the oil and gas and then we can take it from them..
1852 2018-11-29 20:54:32 Why wait just add them to the $196 billion welfare bill 2017/2018....Scotty was supposedly the voodoo economic witch doctor snake oil sales man..who used migrant numbers to prop up bottom line...

1857 2018-11-29 20:53:39 The Special Presidential Task Force on Recovery of Public Assets, has zeroed in on the non-remittance of $1.9 billion by Mobil, being the outstanding cost of the $2.5 billion oil block awarded to it in 2009 by government.
1858 2018-11-29 20:53:31 But but Obama just took credit for crude oil prices dropping
1859 2018-11-29 20:53:30 It is ridiculous I agree. Musk should not have to put in this much effort to fight the oil industy, the automotive industry and the former monopoly, ULA. Glad we are on the same page. :) Have a nice day
1860 2018-11-29 20:53:09 I think the transition has been happening for ages and the Tapcal Trust Fund PCs had their heads up their arses. Same now for @Alberta_UCP Opportunities lost as well as major oil revenues. Good for @OilGasCanada only
1861 2018-11-29 20:53:06 FANG earnings tomorrow! Okay. It's not $FB $AMZN (or $AAPL) $NFLX or $GOOGL. Or even Diamondback Energy, oil company with ticker symbol $FANG. It's Chinese online real estate company Fang Holdings. Ticker symbol $SFUN.

1864 2018-11-29 20:52:46 You forgot to say that Venezuela is the number one in the world in oil extraction and exports, they have more oil that Saudi Arabia. Where all the money went? I can tell you that in the neighborhood of Doral in Miami, live a lot of rich Venezuelans, some came recently.
1865 2018-11-29 20:52:41 Large scale yes. When your factories have their own NaClo plants you usually have a stock of spares. I have routinely seem Hypo plants at swimming pools, food factories, oil and gas plants, and remote accomodation facilities across 3 continents so not hard to maintain.
1866 2018-11-29 20:52:37 Question period again begins on the oil price differential. When will the government act, not for government rail lines in 2020, but to stop a crisis ...right now?
1867 2018-11-29 20:52:34 Oil prices are declined but rising in your so called #NayaPakistan I am witness of your dozens speeches against oil prices when you were in opposition. Koi Sharma koi haya?
1868 2018-11-29 20:52:32 I've been taking CBD oil for about two weeks now, and the only result I maybe have noticed is that I seem to fall asleep faster. I'm not certain if it's a real effect or confirmation bias. It definitely does nothing for any pain.
1869 2018-11-29 20:52:27 Welcome Trend. Hope this continues since OPEC and Russia are going to hold a meeting in first week of December to cut oil production.
1870 2018-11-29 20:52:22 Handwriting on the wall: China, the world's soon to be largest economy, is thirsty for Saudi and Russian oil. Meanwhile we ignore the largest oil reserves in the world in our backyard in Venezuela! WTF? echttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-china-oil-analysis-idUSKCN1NX0Y8

1872 2018-11-29 20:52:10 Oil companies are well connected politically, not because political connections were in their business plan. What happened was that oil companies were unable to diversify, but had lots of money to hire new employees. More:

1888 2018-11-29 20:50:31 OTOH it's only really important as long as KSA is oil superpower & has money to spread regressive ideology to rest of the world.
Post oil they are only affecting their own development possibilities.
My advice to extreme Islamists for 21st Century:
Learn Mandarin. You'll need it.
1889 2018-11-29 20:50:24 Midland trading about -6.0 vs WTI.. So Permian crude around $45/b,  We were just seeing production explode but it took $65+ oil.  At $45/b, we are going to lose US production. Rig count number already reacting strongly.
1890 2018-11-29 20:50:20 What do the oil industry and ULA's nuts taste like?
1891 2018-11-29 20:50:20 Lower oil prices are great for we the people but horrible for the oil industry because they then won't make as much money as before. The oil industry is used to a certain lifestyle and lower oil prices take away that lifestyle.

1895 2018-11-29 20:50:04 Your stupid equation ignores Denmark, Sweden, Germany, Canada.
All these countries do not have state owned oil reserves like Venezuela,
that was its downfall.

1899 2018-11-29 20:49:37 I’m on oil so the meter is just leccy. No mains gas  in my lil town
1900 2018-11-29 20:49:27 Yeah, but they can go be a mechanic anywhere, not too many NBA teams taking resumes or posting openings on Indeed. Stakes are higher for NBA players. Men at your job mess up, they can go work work anywhere that needs someone to change oil or a tire. No offense.
1901 2018-11-29 20:49:27 // got my oil changed and candy so now I'm just chillin in cedar rapids until I have to pick up my baby bro from STEM
1902 2018-11-29 20:49:25 Hot oil doesn't seem to be a healthy option. I've optet to be confined in a pillory while people throw custard pies at me - low fat, naturally!
1903 2018-11-29 20:49:24 Guyana will be one of the top issues to watch in #oil and #gas in South America as gamechanger next year and beyond since it could alter the balance of production and geopolitics although political hurdles could appear soon.. somewhat it resembles me like the case of Lebanon..
1904 2018-11-29 20:49:17 Goodness! Didn't realise how well my blog post has done; thank you so much everyone. =) 

I'm thinking about writing about Iceland's No Palm Oil Christmas advert for the next post; I don't want it make it too scary but I hope it'll be okay to write about.

1910 2018-11-29 20:48:49 Watching an episode of Two and a Half Men while waiting for an oil change. Can we like not use transgender people as a plot device? I know I’m late but like. Ew.
1911 2018-11-29 20:48:45 After i get my oil change , I’m go straight home I’m tired 
1912 2018-11-29 20:48:43 Oooohhhhh, good point! And you’ve given me an idea...I’ll just rename it. Instead of ‘Go the F*ck to Sleep’ it will be ‘Bethlehem’s Lullaby oil.’

1917 2018-11-29 20:48:06 I’m so hungry and all I can think about is searing a steak in truffle oil and how it would taste
1918 2018-11-29 20:47:54 my car's oil and filter change is due. need to do that #Giveaway #Tradeup2SCOTT
1919 2018-11-29 20:47:53 Tea tree oil is actually extremely effective for treating bacterial imbalances in a vaginal ecosystem. Diluted of course with a carrier oil. I’ll talk more about this in my video
1920 2018-11-29 20:47:43 The environmentalists aren't stopping people from getting gas, oil, and lead in their lakes? . . . I'm surprised
1921 2018-11-29 20:47:41 With such a huge tax on oil, 
Yet he will not be able to save the fiscal deficit...
1922 2018-11-29 20:47:39 Up the Saanich peninsula an orca whale washed ashore near the @BCFerries terminal (plus a whale calf). Naturalists say it was killed by a collision w a ship. Hmm, oil tanker? @USNavy aircraft carrier? @PrincessCruises ? Russian submarine? Such a mystery! @GovInslee #bcpoli
1923 2018-11-29 20:47:37 This is factually inaccurate. He was re-elected based based on consecutive record months of job growth, oil independence, and stock market growth. Claiming credit for current growth may be a stretch, but we are in our 9th year of job growth, 9th year of bull market, and recovery.

1925 2018-11-29 20:47:35 Even if everyone stopped burning fossil fuels at once, oil companies could, and would, build up a stockpile for years, in anticipation of a consumer relapse. You can’t change what an oil company employee does by changing the flow of money. Continued:

1927 2018-11-29 20:47:34 It’s a drop and more likely to cause a problem that’s detrimental to AB oil industry & interests. A bandaid on a gash
1928 2018-11-29 20:47:25 I don't think the ropes can get any tighter. By now the game rigged enough pyrotechnics to blow up a building. Pretty sure all that oil is going to cause a major oil slick. People slipping & sliding all over. There are more unfolded chairs than there are people.  #WWESuperCard
1929 2018-11-29 20:47:23 Jean would be a dream in comparison. Not interfering in oil production and balanced budgets. Such novel ideas 
1930 2018-11-29 20:47:20 CBD oil is the god damn best
1931 2018-11-29 20:47:10 Hi Paul, the palm oil that we use is sustainable, meaning that making of it brought no harm to people, animals or the environment. We hope this helps 
1932 2018-11-29 20:47:03 ...But then again, for a long time the west was an insignificant, sparsely populated, largely rural area that took heavy investment from the same central Canadians to build up. My own pet theory is that AB got too much Texas culture rub off on it while the oil patch...

1936 2018-11-29 20:46:37 Because many people including some cinema actors of supported Modi in 2014..... Modi became PM and PM Modi through GSPC looted 20K crs in the name of Oil & Gas exploration...and finally forced ONGC to take over the loss making GSPC !
1937 2018-11-29 20:46:17 Your understanding of your God given PURPOSE is the REVELATION of the SOLUTION(S) you carry...which is the reason for the OIL upon your life and the CRUSHING season God sustained you through!!!!

1938 2018-11-29 20:46:01 Tip of the week. Lemon oil 3 ways: Diffuse to create an atmosphere that   may promote mental clarity. Remove sticky residue! Or add the plus   version to tea or water for enhanced flavour.
1939 2018-11-29 20:46:01 Oil magnate, Arthur Eze supports President Buhari's re-election bid but did NOT make nor promise any donation.

He donated N1bn to Gov. Umahi's re-election campaign not Buhari.

Let's get it CLEAR.

1941 2018-11-29 20:45:56 castor oil really does help with eyelash growth and eyebrows. My brows are thicker than ever before. I don't pluck, shave, fill or do anything else other than use castor oil and I can say that my lashes have beeing growing
1942 2018-11-29 20:45:54 Kam Bala'i my kano boys can do it  @its_hammadrabiu how far can u try
1943 2018-11-29 20:45:50 Oil and ancillaries only contribute about 10% to Canada's GDP. 

In fact, in Alberta, alcohol sales and gambling (combined) contribute as much to Alberta's GDP as oil does.
1944 2018-11-29 20:45:50 Not with this president - he's probably jealous of how many people these snake oil peddlers have scammed.
1945 2018-11-29 20:45:47 Perhaps Putin cancelled to have more time to talk to the Saudi Prince about oil and to Canada about the far north? Was that your line of thinking?
1946 2018-11-29 20:45:44 Everybody likes to joke about LA people not being able to drive in rain like we don’t have oil slick hazards & flash floods, huh?
1947 2018-11-29 20:45:36 Spice up your sex life with an essential oil!
1948 2018-11-29 20:45:26 My current workflow for units involves lots of glazing over white to skip the highlight/shade steps. I still put lots of time into metallics, because I love layering on the grunge/rust/oil/discoloration.
1949 2018-11-29 20:45:25 i've figured out why in movies actors only grab one strawberry to eat.....who would want to eat motor oil covered pancakes...
1950 2018-11-29 20:45:18 Let's be honest, Trudeau has been a better friend to Alberta than Harper ever was. Hell, he sided with us over his B.C. supporters on Trans Mountain; Harper could never be so principled. Trudeau could singlehandedly solve Alberta's oil crisis and we still wouldn't vote for him.
1951 2018-11-29 20:45:16 Then you should make marijuana oil legal for those with chronic pain.
1952 2018-11-29 20:45:12 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1953 2018-11-29 20:45:11 Principles above pragmatism.  I'll take a weaker dollar and higher oil prices in exchange for sanctions.
1954 2018-11-29 20:45:06 ... forget about the "oil money" in Nigeria, country is damn poor! Every indices that proves this assertion you find in every area of Nigerian life... obsolete & decaying infrastructure, high unemployment rate, falling standard of education, high mortality rate, corruption, etc.
1955 2018-11-29 20:45:05 Is there any statistics for that? Or am I suppose to take your word for it? Clearly transporting oil via existing rail lines isnt getting our oil to international markets! Looks like we wont be able to fund everyone's welfare cheques once this country tanks.
1956 2018-11-29 20:44:44 I’ve got oil for the squeak!
1957 2018-11-29 20:44:20 Who insisted on Pence, whose brother has extensive oil related business in russia...

1959 2018-11-29 20:44:10 It’s alright I got 2 big ass bumps in my tires and when I took my car to get an oil change he said I should get new tires bc there’s a good chance they could blow. That was like 4 months ago so

1964 2018-11-29 20:43:50 What is your favorite essential oil?
1965 2018-11-29 20:43:26 I did a bit of oil and just salt and pepper and they're very good indeed. Like munchy salt and pepper Pringles, which are the best Pringles. @helspence
1966 2018-11-29 20:43:22 My body has adapted and is now 70% motor oil
1967 2018-11-29 20:43:17 How much CBD oil does it take to make tax season disappear
1968 2018-11-29 20:43:13 at my meeting today, i received a vape pen with three full cartridges of weed oil. meetings are good now.
1969 2018-11-29 20:43:05 *gets out my brushes, oil paints and paper* I want to teach myself but not had time yet
1970 2018-11-29 20:43:02 you're a poor historian, the Union was created when a Scottish King became King of England (and thereby Wales as well), Scotland at this time was broke. James the 6th (1st of Great Britain) insisted Scotland be an equal partner. Until the oil there was nothing to steal/share.

1974 2018-11-29 20:42:47 Hey ! How about “ NO MORE SAUDI OIL “ or will Eastern Canada insist on getting it from Saudi Arabia
1975 2018-11-29 20:42:42 Sure. And for the record, I said oil and gas demand "will fall" not that it has fallen. Globe is issuing a correction.
1976 2018-11-29 20:42:32 Late lunch: Southern Accidental Ingredient Fusion: Blackeyed peas and tomato slices topped with Daiya (vegan) cheese on sprouted corn tortillas.  I'll probably drizzle hot sauce and olive oil on them when they're done.

1985 2018-11-29 20:41:52 Nigeria's economy was the largest cuz of high prices.... It was the largest for exporting countries cuz the high oil prices meant we could import more of them.. Go and check your facts well... We experienced what's called oil boom without growth

1990 2018-11-29 20:41:17 You know that even at $150 a barrel oil would still cost less than bottled water, right?
1991 2018-11-29 20:41:13 He was a hindrance to the oil business.
1992 2018-11-29 20:41:12 Matt get a fucking oil change
1993 2018-11-29 20:41:10 We would recommend that you add one drop of an essential oil to the dried Dipbrow Pomade and that you always twist the cap tightly when you put it back on and store the Pomade with the cap-side down (so that gravity with pull the product's moisture back up to the top.)

1997 2018-11-29 20:40:52 There's no way in hell that the SA oil/coal industry can remain competitive or grow fast enough to maintain current employment levels.

Additionally Coal to liquids carbon footprint us huge. Gas to liquids being shelved. Only viable if oil remains above USD 120 per barrel.

2009 2018-11-29 20:39:51 The customer relations person at my Nissan dealership is seriously fucking amazing. After an inconvenience she got me a free car wash, then today I get a survey that I do and she got me a free oil change. 
2010 2018-11-29 20:39:44 The level of ash that is continuously on my hands is disrespectful to lotion. These water based lotions ain’t shit. I need petroleum, oil, wax, honey, banana  based lotions only. Sick of this ash, son!

2014 2018-11-29 20:39:06 The environmentalists also argued that new oil activities in the fragile Arctic region would be contrary to the 2016 Paris climate accord, which seeks to limit average global warming to under two degrees Celsius.

2016 2018-11-29 20:38:47 The groups Greenpeace, Natur og Ungdom (Nature and Youth) and the Grandparents Climate Campaign had accused Norway, western Europe’s largest oil and gas producer, of violating a new article of country’s constitution that guarantees since 2014 the right to a healthy environment.
2017 2018-11-29 20:38:45 It's bad because the US put sanctions on them, crippling their economy. The US wants their oil, and they don't want to give it to them, so thus, the sanctions. Also, they were never socialist really to begin with. Kind of more along the lines of Social Democrats
2018 2018-11-29 20:38:37 The renderings are so deceptive...
The longer it goes on, the more it is starting to seem like snake oil.

2021 2018-11-29 20:38:33 This move by automakers towards electric vehicles makes me laugh historically. 20 years ago the US had early footing towards electric vehicle technology but BIG OIL ( more corporate-government meddling) suppressed such progression.
2022 2018-11-29 20:38:31 Its true pipelines are the answer to low oil money to Canada. We are in the grip of an evil demon, called texas intermediate led by a pro demon president.
2023 2018-11-29 20:38:29 "Do you remember what a logic given by Norwegian Court while dismissing Environmental Case?" 5th January, 2018, OSLO: A Norwegian court on Thursday dismissed a case by three environmentalist groups which had sued Norway for granting oil licences in the Arctic.
2024 2018-11-29 20:38:25 And we became more and more dependent on foreign oil which was O's plan. BUT now all these libs want to slam Trump for standing by S.A. for the AMERICAN'S greater good against terrorism, instead of for just one man! It gets to be a nightmare living around Lefties!
2025 2018-11-29 20:38:23 Just want to let everyone know there is not another face on this planet that produces more oil than mine

2033 2018-11-29 20:38:04 I'm a little surprised they sell it back east. I keep it simple and low-carb these days. I used to deep fry the frozen breaded okra, nowadays I just toss frozen whole or cut okra in same oil-garlic-kick mix and air fry it until browned but not burnt

2036 2018-11-29 20:37:41 One day we will talk about how we gotta stop using oil.
2037 2018-11-29 20:37:41 how about buying no more oil from them and stop selling military weapons and supplies to them
2038 2018-11-29 20:37:35 Cruel oil money 
2039 2018-11-29 20:37:28 people make fun of LA drivers in the rain, but really it’s a problem because of the buildup of oil and other shit for so long that when it rains, once out of the four yearly rains, all the roads become crazy slick and we all have to try not to die woot
2040 2018-11-29 20:37:25 Ok no forget it, it’s over, they’ve got coconut oil in there. #insolvent #KirstiesHandmadeChristmas
2041 2018-11-29 20:37:18 A fairly active day in FX with swings up and down within 50 pip ranges with, Fed minutes, Presidential tweets and month end re-balancing all influencing price action. Stocks likewise opened lower in US and are closing higher as Oil dipped below $50 and bounced above $52.
2042 2018-11-29 20:37:18 Like it destroyed Norway  and all the other  Oil producing countries. Oil revenue has been mismanaged by WM . We are a strategic placed Country with huge natural resources and products.
2043 2018-11-29 20:37:17 Tom Trump has basically destroyed the Russian economy because of his unleashing the oil and gas industry in America-Hillary would have continued her war against oil & gas & helped Putin in this regard (Plus Bill received HUGE speaking fees from Moscow) @sullivanradio
2044 2018-11-29 20:37:16 Not if buyers commit to sourcing only deforestation-free palm oil.

2047 2018-11-29 20:37:06 Just passed cox oil trucker with wrapping that said “cox pulling for America.” Hey cox, why don’t you pull this for America. #GlobalWarming #SorryNotSorry
2048 2018-11-29 20:37:01 Ban their oil then there is an accomplishment of success and a benefit to Canada for the people, if yabcant do that much then you are not for the people.
2049 2018-11-29 20:37:01 I accuse her of plagiarizing the band Midnight Oil’s “ beds are burning” in her “don’t lie to me”
2050 2018-11-29 20:37:00 In plain terms value proposition is what makes you or your service different. It could range from: "Very good, clean palm oil at affordable price" to "Quality,African designs and materials affordably and on time"#joinSchoolOfDoersCohort2 send a DM with your email to get an invite
2051 2018-11-29 20:36:52 Yea okayyyy u better don’t make a 30-50 oil change until 1200 dollar +
2052 2018-11-29 20:36:49 On the other hand, if people do not differentiate and buy responsible palm oil, then there will be little incentive for growers to become or remain responsible growers. The forests of SE Asia cannot tolerate a return to business-as-usual in the palm oil industry.
2053 2018-11-29 20:36:44 Also, because we don’t get very much of it, it’s less safe to drive in due to oil build up on the road compared to other areas that get regular rain (not just that we drive in it less so we lack practice).
2054 2018-11-29 20:36:38 It's almost like oil is a dying commodity, tossed about by factors out of our control and Cons have an oil fetish so they refuse to accept science, economics, or change.
2055 2018-11-29 20:36:33 سليم جريصاتي تارك شغله وباله يحقق بشغل الوزير حاصباني  .. خليه نايم لأنه اذا وعي رح يترك البلد عم يحترق ويحطا ع حاصباني
2056 2018-11-29 20:36:31 Deforestation has always been part of the supply chain of palm oil. Continuing demand will only make it worse.
2057 2018-11-29 20:36:26 I gat youuuuuu 
2058 2018-11-29 20:36:24 Good afternoon. Your vehicle has been housed at the dealership for two weeks awaiting an oil change? Which dealership did you visit and what did the Service Manager say regarding the time frame of the service? ^WD
2059 2018-11-29 20:36:22 Obama is delusional. He thinks he is responsible for the oil production boon when he did all he did to keep it down, he says no corruption when you have Holder and Lois Lerner doing their things but he knows media don't care abt truth
2060 2018-11-29 20:36:20 Well you’ll never catch up to me but trims and hot oil treatments help alot
2061 2018-11-29 20:36:18 Much greater yields than other types of oil. Replace palm with say peanut, and you'd have to much larger amounts (and therefore destroy more forest) to get the same amount of oil
2062 2018-11-29 20:36:15 Yes!  Chia seeds, oil, avocado... one of them usually do the trick.
2063 2018-11-29 20:36:12 니가 내 인생에서 유일한 안 싫은 남자ㅇㅅㅇb
2064 2018-11-29 20:36:00 I love people who are HASHTAG OFFENDED by oil companies having known for years about the damage of climate change. Like. Y'all NAIVE NAIVE, aren't you  This is capitalism at its motherfucking core. How can y'all be so shocked 
2065 2018-11-29 20:35:59 "You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.  Surely Your goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever."
2066 2018-11-29 20:35:49 That might work at first but who buys all the oil the companies are making money from selling?
2067 2018-11-29 20:35:42 That’s just additions, not total. It’s cheaper to build new solar/wind than new coal/oil.
2068 2018-11-29 20:35:32 He didn't allow any new leases on federal land and he changed the hours of service to hinder truckers hauling oil from wells to refineries. He did everything he could to hurt oil and gas production.
2069 2018-11-29 20:35:32 The environmentalists also argued that new oil activities in the fragile Arctic region would be contrary to the 2016 Paris climate accord, which seeks to limit average global warming to under two degrees Celsius.
2070 2018-11-29 20:35:24 Like all rational people I would prefer the information formatted in cryptic fragment sentences from an anonymous source, preferably with an accuracy rate below that of a carnival worker guessing my weight?

2072 2018-11-29 20:35:19 The groups Greenpeace, Natur og Ungdom (Nature and Youth) and the Grandparents Climate Campaign had accused Norway, western Europe’s largest oil and gas producer, of violating a new article of country’s constitution that guarantees since 2014 the right to a healthy environment.
2073 2018-11-29 20:35:19 new favorite dupes for brands 
- replace syrup with motor oil for the same effect 
2074 2018-11-29 20:35:16 I know it’s unhealthy but I like the oil that comes from Portuguese sausage lol
2075 2018-11-29 20:35:15 “Hi, I’m the cardboard between your pancakes, Trixie!” 

“And I’m the motor oil you put on because it keeps things slippery, Katya”
2076 2018-11-29 20:35:11 as did my father and he feels the same way.. I would just say try to be more open to people doing their part to make the world a better place and not so quick to judge based on media critiques that are often inaccurate because so many people have billions invested in oil.
2077 2018-11-29 20:35:05 @WWESuperCard  hey guys can you please check your server i am stuck on the loading screen. so much oil of my hair i can't take
2078 2018-11-29 20:34:57 "Do you remember what a logic given by Norwegian Court while dismissing Environmental Case?" 5th January, 2018, OSLO: A Norwegian court on Thursday dismissed a case by three environmentalist groups which had sued Norway for granting oil licences in the Arctic.
2079 2018-11-29 20:34:37 Great point. But talking about sanity, what sane industry sinksinto deliverability when the infrastructure duzn’t exist? That’s another way to look at it, particularly the ongoing expansion of oil sands production. And Cons, like Libs, got no tidewater pipelines built. #cdnpoli
2080 2018-11-29 20:34:35 Oil Can Boyd, Mark Wohlers, Dave Smith and Bob Knepper?
2081 2018-11-29 20:34:34 They’re betas and cucks. That’s why.
2082 2018-11-29 20:34:29 Hello oil
2083 2018-11-29 20:34:21 Rose oil / anointed rose oil
2084 2018-11-29 20:34:19 Corruption and it always comes with great cost. Oil when it was first found in Spindletop oilfield in Texas fueled industries. Assuming there is oil in Palawan area, can you all imagine an oil rig in the West Philippine Sea? 
2085 2018-11-29 20:34:14 Well when you get there let us know cause until then we still need Oil.
2086 2018-11-29 20:34:00 I meant I have the oil rollers you sent me. They help. I haven’t used other oils besides lavender yet.
2087 2018-11-29 20:33:41 No he said he’s filing charges because he’s accusing Mueller of lying. Another thing, Trump could build a tower if he wanted in Russia before president but the fact is he didn’t or isn’t. Who wants to build in Russia then putin take the property like the oil lol?
2088 2018-11-29 20:33:34 InfoChip's tags are chemically etched & designed to withstand harsh conditions found in mines, on oil rigs, & other #industrial areas.

2090 2018-11-29 20:33:26 Hmm. I have a Beretta 92FS, drive a Ford Raptor and love Trump. I have no issues South of the border.
2091 2018-11-29 20:33:26 There’s an oil you can rub on it
2092 2018-11-29 20:33:25 If we can subsidize oil companies, give tax breaks to billionaires, and spend trillions on weapons that are never used, we can feed and educate the populace
2093 2018-11-29 20:33:22 It’s not all or nothing. Even if more consumers boycotted palm oil there’ll still be plenty who won’t out of sheer ignorance & apathy. Lower demand would mean lower prices but it’s unlikely the industry will collapse, but there’ll be far less interest in clearing more forest.
2094 2018-11-29 20:33:18 Excellent idea, Jim. I installed a heat pump 3 years ago, and now I hardly ever need to use my primary source of heat—oil (diesel). However, when run in reverse, the heat pump becomes an ac unit, effectively. Though I probably wouldn’t necessarily sing its praises in the desert.
2095 2018-11-29 20:32:52 Secret ingredient in dozens of chili competitions. 

Mayo is basically fat (oil), and a bit of protein (yolk), and lemon (acid).

Cheese is basically fat (curd), a bit of protein (curd), and lactic acid.

2101 2018-11-29 20:32:02 What a load of bollocks. The oil crash would’ve destroyed us ffs. Too many people cross fingers and hope for the best, we’d be out the EU & no prospect of joining and Scots would be begging for another indyref to get back in the U.K. union.
2102 2018-11-29 20:31:58 @ConserveChange Ah it's a con a POLLIE con we would have ended coal & oil years ago if Tesla power was invested in and not oil!Tesla power is not a battery it's the power of the up atmosphere with trillions of volts waiting to be used the real free energy!But the banks stopped it
2103 2018-11-29 20:31:47 I know how badly you need to feel used...
Well a Goddess like Myself should never have to worry about mundane thing such as paying for brakes, tires and an oil change.
So take your wallet out and be useful!

2104 2018-11-29 20:31:38 Shale patch will be hit hard but OPEC will still be forced to make some big cuts. Oil won't stay down at $10 for very long. I wouldn't want to own energy paper that's for sure.
2105 2018-11-29 20:31:33 You could add "eat food" (fertilizer, transportation, processing) "use electricity" to the list.

Where are all the coal/oil jobs going? What's happening to car manufacturers who didn't get into electric car market?(downsizing)

Renewables/nuclear the way forward.
2106 2018-11-29 20:31:28 Exactly don’t end up like me sis I went Black Friday shopping instead of getting my oil changed like I knew I should have and got the scare of a lifetime 
2107 2018-11-29 20:31:16 The government of Latvia has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Tamron Hall in a broadcloth wig.

2111 2018-11-29 20:30:51 Autonomous vehicles don’t do the world much good if you’re killing people & the biosphere with pollution and side effects of oil addiction. Hydrogen fuel cells are the future #bantheinternalcombustionengine

Im in constant pain but sort of deal with it but the chronic fatigue that accompanies it is awful 
One tweeter told me that the oil
definitely decreases fatigue!
2120 2018-11-29 20:30:21 Thank you for your  support. It's great to just have someone who understands the pain. Trying to come off Tramadol but really struggling,trying CBD oil & bit of weed! Xx
2121 2018-11-29 20:30:16 Al gore lead the US government's efforts to create the internet. Fact

The US became the largest oil producer under Obama. Fact

Just because you dont like either people doesn't change facts. Fact
2122 2018-11-29 20:30:06 No argument against a transition plan to renewable sources of energy, but that is not the issue. We need to begin weaning ourselves off fossil fuels and building more oil capacity runs against that & makes #climatechange worse.

2128 2018-11-29 20:29:46 Tell me, do you condemn the extraction of Saudi Oil or dirty California oil or are you just anti-Canadian?
2129 2018-11-29 20:29:43 What do you think the ultimatum was that convinced them to drop the case?

British oil expertise/personnel, arms deals etc, etc - I wonder..

what's wrong with me
2131 2018-11-29 20:29:25 Good to see walknomics being taken seriously. Not to mention many benefits of reducing demand for imported fuels. Burn fat not oil. 
I am sure @jsaville74 would agree with the benefits of walking.
2132 2018-11-29 20:29:16 it's cream cheese and imitation crab in a thin wrapper deep fried in not-hot-enough oil
2133 2018-11-29 20:29:14 But Canada still buys 20 billion dollars worth of Saudi oil a year every thing else is just irrelevant window dressing
2134 2018-11-29 20:29:08 Thanks abk. 
2135 2018-11-29 20:28:54 Yeah trimmed . Oil and shit from the splash in the face. Very pissed off cos ive reported THAT drain so many fooking times .
2136 2018-11-29 20:28:52 Started diffusing peppermint essential oil at work (a dental office) and a new patient came in and said it smelled like toothpaste in here 
2137 2018-11-29 20:28:48 ye-haw it's raining oil, we're rich!
2138 2018-11-29 20:28:46 Yes because oil at 30 bucks a barrel is his fault. Do us a favor and leave the politics for the adults.
2139 2018-11-29 20:28:25 We can replace petrochemical energy with clean tech, at the prices we pay today, if we can find the political will to do so. Kinetic capture could bankrupt oil and gas in a couple of years. Scare tactics will place you on the wrong side of history, trading the future for votes
2140 2018-11-29 20:28:18 @bctoday  sure climate change is real but both sides need to stop the blatant lies. Where is this pipeline leaking?  Canada not selling oil will not stop others from using it!

Bwaaaaaaahaaaaaaaahaaaaaaaaa

He had trouble keeping a straight face while telling that one the freaking idiot thinks we have memories like his sheep supporters
2152 2018-11-29 20:27:06 That's a good question. There are two consensuses, one I think is right, one I don't. 

The pro-seed oil consensus is based on epidemiology, and is ignorant of or ignores experimental data.

I find the experimental data compelling, see my pinned tweet.

2155 2018-11-29 20:26:27 Russia is a terrorist state which uses gas and oil to blackmail other normal nations all around itself. Ukraine didn't steal gas from own pipes. Kremlin did that using oligarchs like Medvedchuk and corrupt Ukrainian officials. So shut up your dirty mouth.
2156 2018-11-29 20:26:22 Nice castle. Even then, religious wars.

Now, US oil + Eretz Israel wars
2157 2018-11-29 20:26:05 I hope too we never find oil. Remember the curse of oil—the revenue is always stolen by government officials, every country in the world except Norway which has the most number of millionaires.

2161 2018-11-29 20:25:29 Currency induced inflation is a real thing in the world. However, its not a U.S. problem. A lot of that is tied to countries that rely on a commodity price, Russia is a good example of one with oil prices.
2162 2018-11-29 20:25:26 WTF!! HE DID everything possible to restrict, reduce our oil production.
2163 2018-11-29 20:25:24 On the plus side, my giant horse-dog drank a bunch of vegetable oil...
2164 2018-11-29 20:25:13 Hope they're not using specially voted oil money for the rebuilding.
2165 2018-11-29 20:25:10 How about subsidies for oil and gas industry new technologies?? Wasted enough on green BS
2166 2018-11-29 20:25:00 I learned a lot of this in like elementary school art class lmao but I love to see motor oil being poured over pancakes. There’s another vid where they show the Elmer’s glue
2167 2018-11-29 20:24:59 Read all the use of castor oil and I’m hoping it’ll work for my hair 
2168 2018-11-29 20:24:57 I have truffle oil,  now I’m thinking bout making a fire chicken sandwich to go with some truffle fries
2169 2018-11-29 20:24:55 The environmentalists also argued that new oil activities in the fragile Arctic region would be contrary to the 2016 Paris climate accord, which seeks to limit average global warming to under two degrees Celsius.
2170 2018-11-29 20:24:40 I don't trust fish oil after what happened with the inhumans in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. 
2171 2018-11-29 20:24:34 The groups Greenpeace, Natur og Ungdom (Nature and Youth) and the Grandparents Climate Campaign had accused Norway, western Europe’s largest oil and gas producer, of violating a new article of country’s constitution that guarantees since 2014 the right to a healthy environment.
2172 2018-11-29 20:24:30 Motor oil be lookin delicious
2173 2018-11-29 20:24:28 "Ausgebrannt" By Andread Eschbach. Its a story about the world getting stripped of CHEAP oil. Since our world is addicted to Oil this has major catastrophic consequenzes. Its a good read and opens your mind to how economics work and how one good effects everyone life.
2174 2018-11-29 20:24:23 Oil? Obama?.....please..... So why doesn't the left blame him for "climate change"?
2175 2018-11-29 20:24:22 if FL showed anything it's how deep partisanship is. how ingrained voting for a letter (R) really is, considering the results on the ballot measures was a sea of liberalism. 65-70%+ voting to give ex felon voting right, to ban gerrymandering and lobbying, ban oil drilling, etc.
2176 2018-11-29 20:24:20 I have oil in my hair everyday so I am not a walking lil poof
2177 2018-11-29 20:24:20 When I was a kid I thought castor oil was made from beavers because castor is French for beaver. It's made from castor beans.
2178 2018-11-29 20:24:19 "Do you remember what a logic given by Norwegian Court while dismissing Environmental Case?" 5th January, 2018, OSLO: A Norwegian court on Thursday dismissed a case by three environmentalist groups which had sued Norway for granting oil licences in the Arctic.
2179 2018-11-29 20:24:16 I guess that doesn’t mean cancelling the 20 billion dollars worth of oil Canada buys from Saudi Arabia a year because we don’t have an east west pipeline to ship crude from Alberta to refineries in the east coast, Trudeau kyboshed  that to keep Quebec happy
2180 2018-11-29 20:24:07 Essential oils are #FragrantOils extracted from plants chiefly through steam distillation (eucalyptus oil) or expression (grapefruit oil)
2181 2018-11-29 20:23:47 Omg asda uses palm oil in there sweets not happy
2182 2018-11-29 20:23:46 On @FoxNews 4 pm hour with @TeamCavuto and the best oil analyst on earth @PhilFlynnEnergy. Oil, fed, markets. #FoxNews
2183 2018-11-29 20:23:44 But it's not a big deal if you line your pockets with big oil money.
2184 2018-11-29 20:23:42 Price of Oil is everything to Nigeria economy
2185 2018-11-29 20:23:38 Fancy words you toss around...lobbyist, staffers. Of course, one has nothing to do with the other, & the odds of them communicating are beyond remote. I'm sure the White House gardener (a staffer) is chatting it up with someone pushing for fewer oil restrictions (lobbyist).
2186 2018-11-29 20:23:34 Oil will do
2187 2018-11-29 20:23:26 Sad ...RIP
2188 2018-11-29 20:23:20 Oil is the backbone of southern New Mexico. Lots of money in oil down there. The state lost a decent amount of money a few years ago by investing too much into oil though.
2189 2018-11-29 20:23:07 Obama did the same thing yesterday, claiming credit for the abundance of oil, after he spent 8 years trashing America's oil industry and doing everything in his power to undermine it. Time for Americans to tell Obama: "YOU DIDN'T BUILD THAT!!"
2190 2018-11-29 20:23:07 Need to oil Mother soon. Get all the hard-to-reach places.
2191 2018-11-29 20:23:06 Wait I thought Obama cared about the environment now he is taking credit for being the largest oil producer. I called it saying Obama accomplished nothing but is waiting to jump on all Trump’s victories. Obama is a hypocrite!
2192 2018-11-29 20:22:56 Do you need a hand to rub that oil in
2193 2018-11-29 20:22:54 Process of separating water from oil is ?
2194 2018-11-29 20:22:36 امين يارب العالمين 
تسلمي ربي يسعدك
2195 2018-11-29 20:22:34 Took advantage of this today - palm oil free mince pies, lovely Portuguese wine. Thanks!
2196 2018-11-29 20:22:31 They have military n oil but economy is shit. Perhaps the whole world needs to put the squeeze on. Although he had Assad.Putin has a chip on his shoulder because of his background. He feels he has a point to prove. Let’s hope he is never allowed to prove it. Russia is changing .
2197 2018-11-29 20:22:30 Yeah, never forget that no oil has reached the US after passing through the Strait of Hormuz since the revolution  in '79!!
2198 2018-11-29 20:22:23 What a crock! Did oil production go up during his administrations? Yes, by over 80%! But, that increase was ALL ON PRIVATE LANDS. NET PRODUCTION ON FED LANDS REMAINED ROUGHLY SAME AS WHEN HE ENTERED OFFICE. HE DID HIS BEST TO LOWER PRODUCTION, BUT OIL SHALE BOOM FOILED HIM!
2199 2018-11-29 20:22:06 I want to know if Trump was promised a cut of the Rosneft oil deal? The Saudis were involved too.
2200 2018-11-29 20:22:04 Take advantage while you can man. Oil barrels are still recovering from record lows, so gas will be cheap for a little longer.
2201 2018-11-29 20:22:02 100,000 Oil Workers are out of a job due to Justin Trudeau & his inexperienced Liberal band of misfits. He must get fired! All those Liberals must be fired!
100,000 workers. Wow! huge number!
#OutLiberals
#TrudeauMustGo
2202 2018-11-29 20:22:02 And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed hellish them.
2203 2018-11-29 20:21:58 Oil reversed course and rose as much as 3 percent on Thursday, after industry sources said Russia had accepted the need to cut production, together with OPEC ahead of its meeting next week.

2206 2018-11-29 20:21:18 So after hounding me to get my oil changed for weeks to “avoid car repairs”, I called dad to tell him I did and tell him my break pads needed changing as they were on the red marker of the measurement stick. HE SAID NOT TO DO IT. HOW DOES THAT MAKE SENSE? OH YA IT DOESNT
2207 2018-11-29 20:21:13 Great news for The Govt as oil hits 50$. It can help us to keep the inflation low and reduce oil import bill. Govt should reduce oil prices and give relief @Asad_Umar @PTIofficial
2208 2018-11-29 20:21:12 put castor oil on your eyebrows and eyelashes. it is the best form of self love you can have
2209 2018-11-29 20:21:06 Somehow french fries made in used oil taste way better than those made in unused oil
2210 2018-11-29 20:21:03 *whispers* tea tree oil topically for active pimples. Dilute w grapeseed if you're sensitive. I've been using vitamin c serum after steaming my face and its calmed down A LOT. Aztec mask works wonders, so does a plain old raw honey mask for 20 mins after cleansing

2212 2018-11-29 20:20:37 We're committed to using only the most sustainable sources of palm oil in our products. We have removed it wherever possible and 100% of the palm oil used in M&S products is RSPO certified. Emma 2/2
2213 2018-11-29 20:20:26 America was intentionally destablized ME by being founder of Isis & fuelled d rise of it in Syria & Iraq for d sake of cheap oil but when Iran didn’t surrender to their wills even despite sanctions,the situation changed and got out of control for US & that’s what make them angry
2214 2018-11-29 20:20:23 I wrote this on the school blackboard and asked the teacher to say it out loud  . Well oil beef hooked . Got quite  a laugh
2215 2018-11-29 20:20:23 We have a range of different mince pies in our stores. All ingredients are clearly listed on the packaging but some of them do contain palm oil. 1/2
2216 2018-11-29 20:20:21 Παρουσίαση για την ελιά My playce Glyfada 
Ευχαριστούμε πολύ την ομάδα Novϵmbϵr Olive Oil που ενημέρωσε τους μικρούς μας φίλους για την πολύτιμη ελιά και την παραγωγή του ελαιόλαδου. Δοκιμάστε και εσείς  τα τέλεια προιόντα τους σε επιλεγμένα καταστήματα!!!
2217 2018-11-29 20:20:09 Theres so essential oil treatments too. I think lavender is one of them
2218 2018-11-29 20:20:04 I hate that shit. It tastes so bad. Just get regular coffee and throw some coconut oil in it.
2219 2018-11-29 20:19:58 Well hold on there's a little bit but it's not nearly enough for psychoactivity at under 0.3% compared to around 15% for weed

CBD isolate, no THC but in the full spec oil yes 

just wanna educate the peeople 
2220 2018-11-29 20:19:55 Unreal that our eastern provinces buy oil from Saudi when Canada is shipping oil out at $12 a barrel!
2221 2018-11-29 20:19:54 Grateful today for my last free service on my van with oil change. And grateful that when I walked outside this am there was the fresh smell of rain with mild temps 
2222 2018-11-29 20:19:49 Awesome!  Now don't let the @dccc screw it up by putting all their eggs in the basked of Oil Company cabana boy Beto.  The IPCC report will NOT be ignored by progressive dems this next election cycle.  @Planitchange10
2223 2018-11-29 20:19:47 Follow the money, most politicos will say anything for campaign cash. Lot of oil in that state.
2224 2018-11-29 20:19:41 including the Saudi Crown Prince ? Wouldn't that be the real story here ? Or maybe even halting all oil imports from the "Kingdom"?
2225 2018-11-29 20:19:39 I sincerely hope you outgrow this idealistic crusade against climate change and work with @NancyPelosi to include the oil/gas/coal lobby in any climate legislation. Compromise is important!!!
2226 2018-11-29 20:19:36 After this week I can't believe that is anything other than motor oil
2227 2018-11-29 20:19:22 -buys Guerlain watery oil because Kelis uses Guerlain watery oil.
2228 2018-11-29 20:19:18 It's a miracle oil! I need to find flavored CBD oil, the natural is 
2229 2018-11-29 20:19:07 Can nobody see the connection? The petro-carbon industry is dying a long slow death. That affects the oil extraction and traditional auto industries. We should not be throwing good money after bad by striving to prolong the death throes.
2230 2018-11-29 20:19:02 Sam's club sells a coconut oil lotion that is like a miracle worker..I think its exclusive to their store.And it's only 8.99 for a small tub of it.Try it once you will never want to use anything else ever again.
2231 2018-11-29 20:18:57 今日は何オイルがいいかい?アロマオイルで香りたい?オリーブオイルでイタリアンたい?ふふふ…僕は君のためならどんなオイルにもなってやるさ…
2232 2018-11-29 20:18:56 Anyone down to keep me company while I get my oil changed hehe 
2233 2018-11-29 20:18:55 It is amazing. Infact I did my PhD on the agricultural production of tea tree oil. It's a terrific antimicrobial.
2234 2018-11-29 20:18:42 Hundreds of thousands of gallons LEAKED from the pipeline in 2017.  But as long as oil businesses raking in the dough...
2235 2018-11-29 20:18:22 Oil. Like always, the answer to every policy question in the Middle East.
2236 2018-11-29 20:18:12 Not sure how you take credit for something you said would never happen. All your regulations nearly choked the oil industry to death.  You can say what you want but that doesn’t make it true. History will be the judge!!!!

2237 2018-11-29 20:18:05 They say a picture is worth a thousand words, and we say field experience is worth a thousand text books. In compliance with this philosophy, @SPE_KSU organizes a field trip for students from various departments at @_KSU to an oil rig located in Khurais that is - (1)
2238 2018-11-29 20:18:03 I'm more disturbed by the fact that oil looks remarkably identical to syrup
2239 2018-11-29 20:17:48 They would keep shoring it up, they started it when oil prices were lower and reserves were lower, they wouldn't want to convulse the economy into another recession with another free fall of the Naira like it happened last time out.
2240 2018-11-29 20:17:46 I've been on this page for a while.

A friend of mine is an oil CEO  for a Polish firm working in Canada.

I asked him how much of an influence Russia is on his role... 

A: Constantly involved at the top level.

How come the military  now lacks equipments?

2244 2018-11-29 20:17:21 I wanna take my weave out just to go to the spa..them hoes be tryna lift up my braids like sis you cant put oil in these bundles i'll kill you lmao
2245 2018-11-29 20:17:14 The snowmobile itch is starting to set in. Im not sure if it was the $100 for 2 gallons of oil or the $130 battery that needs to be replaced that sparked it.
2246 2018-11-29 20:16:56 It is wierd! Saw it a few months ago, and it's like oil inside the wine, genuinely swirls like a lava lamp! I wouldn't dare try it...
2247 2018-11-29 20:16:54 I mean, if you wanna teach someone to drive a car, you don't first take 'em up front, pop the hood, and tell them they need to learn to change the oil first. It's "engineless".
2248 2018-11-29 20:16:53 pga oil natun ginawngan ko
2249 2018-11-29 20:16:47 I’m getting my oil changed and there’s 5 mechanics huddled around my car like they’re preforming brain surgery I’m scared

2252 2018-11-29 20:16:41 Doing adult things and getting an oil change instead of going out and spending that money on workout clothes 
2253 2018-11-29 20:16:39 Honestly have to be numbing my gum with clove oil
2254 2018-11-29 20:16:33 And thanks to the idiocy of Energy East denial incompetence, Quebec sabotaged the rest of us, federal leadership nonexistent, we sop up Saudi oil like hookers looking for their pay. And then,  Freeland expects to be taken seriously? Not.
2255 2018-11-29 20:16:25 Oil should claim him and trade Talbot to Canes for ?
2256 2018-11-29 20:16:20 Quite the opposite. Investing in alternative energy would create jobs in every state, reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and help offset our carbon footprint. Left or right, we would all benefit from infrastructure improvements across the USA.
2257 2018-11-29 20:16:17 That is her you talk when you are giving some oil wells

2260 2018-11-29 20:16:02 Gents, you're missing the nice sheen  - sort of like a slick of oil.
2261 2018-11-29 20:15:58 Brent crude rose by US75 cents or 1.3% to US$59.51 a barrel and the US Nymex price rose by US$1.16 or 2.3% to US$51.45 a barrel.

2263 2018-11-29 20:15:55 Tough one. We spend in various ways to support industries with tons of incentives and loans and infrastructure builds. But. Big oil gets a lot of subsidies already. and are mega profitable as corporations still.
2264 2018-11-29 20:15:54 I went to get my oil changed and ended up spending $120 Bc my car was in such shitty shape lmao
2265 2018-11-29 20:15:50 this 67ryals oil better make some change or else
2266 2018-11-29 20:15:45 There is no oil there
2267 2018-11-29 20:15:33 I wonder if having an intel team for most of his career plus his connections built over time helps?

My skimming reading glasses need an oil change to keep skimming smoothly! 
2268 2018-11-29 20:15:28 I’ve had a rough day, but now I’m lying in my tub filled with rose oil drops, eating chocolate and thinking I don’t give a shit
2269 2018-11-29 20:15:20 Yep that's right keep on spreading lies of how you made or oil production go up when you're not in office. Some hat trick there buddy.

2272 2018-11-29 20:15:04 Only good news is that the oil companies lost the Constitution Commerce Clause argument in both Portland, OR and S. Portland, ME. Although it is currently being appealed in Maine.
2273 2018-11-29 20:15:03 I always feel so guilty getting my oil changed in the winter bc these dudes gotta be cold af
2274 2018-11-29 20:15:03 Yeah he stopped all drilling for oil and the pipeline from Canada.
2275 2018-11-29 20:15:00 Funny, I took my car for an oil change the other day and told the mechanics they were just money driven and they gave me the oil change for free because they’re passionate about doing oil changes.
2276 2018-11-29 20:14:46 @Ohio End Climate Change, Stop Coal, Tarsands, Oil, Fracking! Go Wind Energy, Solar, Batteries!
2277 2018-11-29 20:14:32 My wife asked me why I was covered in oil.

I answered, you say I never glisten.
2278 2018-11-29 20:14:26 Did he rub oil  on his face...
2279 2018-11-29 20:14:18 Diesel fuel and engine oil
2280 2018-11-29 20:14:03 The only positive of drilling for oil around here
2281 2018-11-29 20:13:57 The oil merchant.
2282 2018-11-29 20:13:53 If someone says to me, "Your dick is small," I assume it's because they want it, know they're not going to get it, so they're consoling themselves by claiming it's small. #SourGrapes
2283 2018-11-29 20:13:52 Democrats=racism, Hilary=murderer, Obama=Idiot, need I go further? But I sure bet you like the extra money in your pocket & in your retirement account, right? Economy is going crazy, we are the largest supplier of oil, lowest unemployment.......
2284 2018-11-29 20:13:50 NDP/Libs haven’t helped but mature nature of the basin & unwillingness of a relative few big intermediate and senior companies to allow rest of the biz into resource plays, oil sands hasn’t helped. Noting those factors duzn’t contribute to your agenda of political expediency tho.
2285 2018-11-29 20:13:47 Now that we’re opening up ANWR I’m not sure we need SA for our oil supply. Domestic production plus other sources should be adequate.
2286 2018-11-29 20:13:45 Wow, that a compelling, fact-based, and insightful argument. If only the global scientific community could produce some evidence to back up their claims amirite? They must be raking in loads of cash off this whole deal unlike the oil companies who’re looking out for all of us!
2287 2018-11-29 20:13:43 Demand & therefore a high price for palm oil has a negative impact on remaining forests also, plus it means the land value is higher meaning you can’t buy as much to restore it. All governments in SE Asia are corrupt & will allow more forests to be cleared. They only care about $
2288 2018-11-29 20:13:33 What would YOU suggest?

If they slow oil production the world suffers

US & world economy suffers

If you hold back arms deal Iran benefits & terrorism wins

It's a shit sandwich & everyone has to take a bite of it if we want to continue the financial recovery
2289 2018-11-29 20:13:29 Manchester City can only dream about being as big a club as Liverpool ..football was invented before Arab oil money bought you your success
2290 2018-11-29 20:13:23 I never suggested it for a long term solution, which would be pipelines, but, it would start oil moving within 1 or 2 days.
2291 2018-11-29 20:13:17 Everytime I see pancakes in an ad now I wonder which brand of motor oil they used 
2292 2018-11-29 20:13:16 He got a share of a $6billion oil well. He good.
2293 2018-11-29 20:13:15 ok YES everyone knows it’s cardboard and motor oil now please stop lol

2298 2018-11-29 20:12:46 thats hair oil
2299 2018-11-29 20:12:45 Should be closer to 1.90 based on wholesale pricing. Oil companies are   making a killing slow rolling the price drop.

How do you disagree with lowering middle class taxes, securing the border, lowest unemployment, increased oil production.
Trump’s net worth has dropped significantly since he took office - because he’s not screwing US.
2301 2018-11-29 20:12:42 It could equally be said that the approach of boycotting palm oil is not helping the forests and orangutans. Consume or don't consume what you like, but if you want to save forests and orangutans, demand brands and retailers remove deforestation from their supply chains.
2302 2018-11-29 20:12:32 dipped in olive oil, balsamic vinegar and parmesan cheese!
2303 2018-11-29 20:12:27 It could equally be said that the approach of boycotting palm oil is not helping the forests and orangutans. Consume or don't consume what you like, but if you want to save forests and orangutans, demand brands and retailers remove deforestation from their supply chains.
2304 2018-11-29 20:12:23 Hoping that the reduction of global use of fossil fuels; halting of palm oil production & destruction of rainforests; an immediate int'l ban on overfishing; banning single use plastics, and increased support & use of of renewable energy will receive at least this much attention.
2305 2018-11-29 20:12:06 I wouldn't wish your products on my worse enemy. Tasteless rubbish. What are you doing about using palm oil?
2306 2018-11-29 20:12:03 I'm praying for you and your father Sheila. The lord is with you. Please look into black seed oil. God bless you and your family
2307 2018-11-29 20:11:52 Everything this idiot listed in his tweet has nothing to do with Trump. Our US military ordered the killing of the Russian mercenaries in Syria not Trump. Russia won Syria by the way. Domestic oil production has been increasing for years. Nothing we did to stop Russia in Ukraine.

2310 2018-11-29 20:11:39 So, iron railroad spikes around the perimeter of your property AND the house itself (two layers of defense!), the spikes being anointed with e.g. Fiery Wall of Protection oil or similar high-octane Martian-Solar-Fiery stuff. If apartment, use nails in the corners of baseboards.
2311 2018-11-29 20:11:32 How can you predict oil prices? You tax profits not revenue. Things are not rosey in Aberdeen at the moment and oil tax revenues are the lowest in the history of the North Sea
2312 2018-11-29 20:11:29 .When #Saddam was cornered, he burned his country (oil fields); When Saddam #Trump is cornered by Mueller & Dems, he’ll try to  burn down America, starting w/ Congress, DOJ, & economy
2313 2018-11-29 20:11:22 Yes, veg oil combustion products are worse for you than animal fats, which are not harmful.

The whole misconception is based on animal studies using Crisco, seed oils + trans fats.

And guess what's worse, seed oils or trans fats...
2314 2018-11-29 20:11:15 I’m sure he’d love all of the olive oil 
2315 2018-11-29 20:11:11 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
2316 2018-11-29 20:10:52 Also if said boycott resulted in driving down the price of palm oil, it would be that much more attractive for feedstock for biofuels and for livestock feed, as well as in large markets like India and China. Again that would have negative impacts on the remaining forests.
2317 2018-11-29 20:10:37 Shell is nothing more than a Shell Game.
They left Alberta and are now trying to continue the land lock policy they always supported, that's their agenda and nothing more. They know that oil will continue for a long long time.
2318 2018-11-29 20:10:37 I do mine raw with garlic, smoked paprika, cayenne, finely chopped onion, sun-dried tomato puree, bouillon & honey. a wee drizzle of olive oil and pap into the oven. Yummity yum
2319 2018-11-29 20:10:36 Add CVX COP in that list of oil stocks that have held stronger than crude the past two weeks with new lows in CL.
2320 2018-11-29 20:10:24 @chrislhayes May be a good time to pull out the Dossier and check off its points. Christopher Steele’s spy work looks increasingly spot on as time goes by. Wonder about those promised payments/share of oil revenues. #SteeleDossier
2321 2018-11-29 20:10:20 Because every conversation ever needs to be about Alberta and oil though, right? Can’t discuss anything else 
2322 2018-11-29 20:10:20 Leftists: "We need to switch to wind energy!"
Coal miners + oil drillers: "But then we're unemployed!"

2326 2018-11-29 20:10:08 BHO has NO shame, he was against all type of oil production including the Dakotas pipelines. He crippled America & now is counting on the uninformed & bias MSM to spread more LIES.

2332 2018-11-29 20:09:39 Yep.  And Trump thinks if he can talk down oil prices that he can force the hand of the Fed.  We'll see about all of that.
2333 2018-11-29 20:09:36 I would have never thought canned sardines/mackerel in olive oil/water would be some of the best things most US grocery stores have to offer .
2334 2018-11-29 20:09:23 If such a boycott did put the palm oil industry out of business in Indonesia and Malaysia, the likely alternative use of these areas would be for soya, which would lead to increased deforestation due to low yields.
2335 2018-11-29 20:08:53 @Chrysler @fiat @PomocoAuto Worst service hands down. Almost a month for an oil change and lightbulb!

2337 2018-11-29 20:08:49 Balsamic vinegar and oil?
2338 2018-11-29 20:08:17 Canada, with 3rd largest oil reserves, still prefers to import OPEC oil at world prices and give Cdn oil to US at a discount of $80Million/ day as a captive supplier.
2339 2018-11-29 20:08:13 She has not mentioned a word about the biggest oil spill ever on the east coast... Maybe husky oil is backing her for next election?

2341 2018-11-29 20:08:02 We have 3 major interests in the #MiddleEast 
1. Oil - which we don't really need and can wean ourselves from.
2. Israel - We can pledge to defend them but they demand they handle their own domestic and foreign affairs.
3.  Counterterriorism  
What we don't need is Saudi Arabia.

2344 2018-11-29 20:07:55 Failing Oil Prices
    Oil prices have plunged by about 25 percent in the last month while the cost of gasoline has tumbled to as little as $2 a gallon in several states. President Trump is pushing for even lower prices, calling it a “big Tax Cut for America and the World.”

2350 2018-11-29 20:07:34 Climatologists make the same ammount of money as any other scientist. Where is this money? Big oil made $51.5 billion last quarter, who give huge amounts of money to republican politicians to deny climate change. That’s a lot of $, why don’t you think they have an agenda?

2361 2018-11-29 20:06:26 Translation... murder is bad... but if oil is involved... eh... not that bad.
2362 2018-11-29 20:06:22 Fox & other did blame Obama for prices when oil became more expensive. The US did become a net exporter of oil & energy under Obama. The price of oil did drop dramatically under Obama. Kind of think Obama may have a point.

Besides Russia won in Syria and they don't give a fuck about their mercenaries killed. We have been increasing our oil production for the last 6 years.
2381 2018-11-29 20:04:56 Hi Gwen. Since 2015, we have sourced 100% of our palm oil for our own-label food products from sustainable RSPO-certified sources. We are on track to ensure that 100% of palm oil for our own brand non-food products is sourced from RSPO certified sources by the end of 2018.
2382 2018-11-29 20:04:53 Also lots of home burning of coal for cooking and heating. 

So are you saying veg oil combustion products are worse for health than animal fats? Is that consensus opinion or an extension of your opinion that eating more animal is better for your health than eating more plants?

2400 2018-11-29 20:03:01 2 months ago the worry was inflation.  Now I am hearing more deflation talk.

Skilled labor is in short supply and immigration policy has worsened.
2401 2018-11-29 20:03:01 So odd, when he was president the EPA was stopping off shore drilling and trying to stop us from having oil here. Smh, do they think we forgot or can not pull that info up. I'm so confused

2419 2018-11-29 20:01:48 And don’t forget how he consistently invested his political capital in promoting the production of fossil fuels in the U.S. during his eight years in office (was it only eight??!!??) and now rightfully claims credit for oil and gas production records being set here.

2436 2018-11-29 20:00:57 45 in a week, never had one and while in the Military never got one. So, peddle this snake oil somewhere else. The side effects alone will produce maladies that will require medication to further line your filthy coffers.

2448 2018-11-29 20:00:16 Hi Elizabeth. It’s come to my attention that a number of prominent ‘orangutan’ charities are actually telling people they should not boycott palm oil because it’s ‘paternalistic’ & we have no right to hinder ‘economic development’ of those countries.
2449 2018-11-29 20:00:09 Nothing will be done about it, the ukraine is on its own here. For.years russia has been shutting off the gas supplies to ukraine, people freezing to death in their homes, the media silent on all fronts when it comes to ukraine. Russia has Europe over a barrel of oil.

2462 2018-11-29 19:58:57 Yeah, that's why I hate politicians that don't believe in climate change and just happen to take fossil fuel company money (companies that, themselves, build their offshore oil rigs to account for climate change).
2463 2018-11-29 19:58:57 I have to go get my oil changed tomorrow and I hope they don’t find anything else wrong 
2464 2018-11-29 19:58:51 The weekend always gives me time to indulge in my skin and hair routine. I have a gentle mask every two weeks using the @audra_james green tea mask.

2466 2018-11-29 19:58:49 It’s good to see the government standing up to the Saudis. But apparently they can look past murder and human rights violations, when it comes to buying oil. I guess it’s ok, better than that “Dirty Alberta Oil”. Enjoy your staggering hypocrisy Eastern Canada

2475 2018-11-29 19:57:29 They arent closing because of the carbon tax. They're closing because they are moving a way from SUV's into vehicles that are less oil dependent. Since we kept ignoring the trends of greener technology because we didnt want to give up our precious gas, we can't compete with China

President Trump has put oil production back in place, increased GDP & Jobs. Obama preys on the uninformed

2504 2018-11-29 19:55:06 Things are real sick. Just watched Obama claim he is the reason for energy independence and record oil production. He, who closed the gulf to drilling, roadblocks both pipelines, regulated fracking up the ass, Jesus Christ what a piece of shit. He got the economy roaring too?
2505 2018-11-29 19:54:58 Actually no, but the people who read periodicals like the Economist will know that neither president is responsible, to be fair the US oil boom began before Obama
2506 2018-11-29 19:54:56 Hey, Jack. Doesn't the #Keystone pipeline carry Canadian Oil to the gulf for shipping Canadian Oil out of the U.S.? So, how is that paying off for the U.S. when it has nothing to do with U.S. oil production? #ThanksObama

2522 2018-11-29 19:52:30 Ford had nothing to do with the drop in price. Zero. Oil is low right now so therefore your gas is cheaper. Will you blame him when it goes up, which it will soon.
2523 2018-11-29 19:52:08 I bought some stuff from them a while ago and it was never very good and usually smelled like motor oil for some reason.
2524 2018-11-29 19:52:01 Why is it not inevitable if we build oil and gas sectors? I would think it should help a lot.
2525 2018-11-29 19:51:59 We should spend that $700 mil on rail cars to get oil to BC. Oh wait...

2530 2018-11-29 19:51:16 I smoke far to much for any of it to even make it to oil  is it RSO oil you make?
2531 2018-11-29 19:51:16 Actually, because it never rains here, lots of oil and other gross stuff gets released from the roads when it rains, making it more slippery than in places where it rains often.
2532 2018-11-29 19:51:11 @realDonaldTrump and this same president has made the regime of Iran It will complete and bring peace in the world. Once again, I emphasize that until April Iran's oil exports should reach zero and there should never be an independent financial system in Europe

2564 2018-11-29 19:48:59 Alberta's dirty oil that no one wants to refine (unless there's a huge price discount) can't compete against supply from Saudi, USA, and Russia. Shut the whole thing down. It's useless.
2565 2018-11-29 19:48:59 So, when the first inklings of microclimate change, desertification, and disruption in the carbon cycle occurred in the Fertile Crescent some 6 thousand years ago, we blame this on big oil too or...?

2569 2018-11-29 19:48:43 True it is life changing. I found this change to be a challenge, but positive. I am floored by the number of people in YYC that have zero respect for advanced education degrees and think the oil industry will just pick up again tomorrow.
2570 2018-11-29 19:48:31 My pops uses cbd oil, balms and other stuff on his back after he had like 6 of his vertebrae’s replaced with springs and plates. It helps him a lot with pain.
2571 2018-11-29 19:48:29 Regardless if it is for the greater good (see: oil, coal, gas, cigarettes, utilities, health insurers, telephone companies). Also, subsidies should be used to promote emerging industries for early adoption, job training, R&D, and have a chance against lobbyists.
2572 2018-11-29 19:48:28 @TirsbaekTV anyone you know that wants a D90 with 300tdi and ZF4HP22? Bigger turbo, full width intercooler, dislocating cones, 3" lift kit with corrected radius arms, got some steel wheels but got bare alloys, snorkle, A frame.Needs some wires connecting, gearbox oil filling etc.
2573 2018-11-29 19:48:28 I only eat my pancakes with motor oil
2574 2018-11-29 19:48:27 right, and so if you had any logical sense to look at what he’s done against the magnitude of obstacles he’s faced from the oil industry & other auto manufacturers is actually incredible & their dominance is just beginning.. you speak as if the company is a bust. sad!
2575 2018-11-29 19:48:22 Same! or when they give you the only vegan option and its a garden salad with oil/vinegar.

2578 2018-11-29 19:48:12 Oil deserves to die haha???? What planet do you live on! What powers your cold apartment in Toronto? @manny_ottawa @mrbinnion clueless millennials .. Canada is ruined and hopeless. Moving to Miami 
2579 2018-11-29 19:48:09 Sandopolis is cool and I respect it a LOT for doing something different a lá Oil Ocean in Mania... but it is still my least favourite zone in S&K lol. I find Desert stages to be very visually boring most of the time but the preview image and music seem promising to subvert that
2580 2018-11-29 19:48:07 @realDonaldTrump First, until April, Iran's oil exports should reach zero, and secondly, there should never be an independent financial system, each of these Two options are not implemented, the sanctions will be ineffective and this will never be forgiven
2581 2018-11-29 19:48:06 @POTUS what are your thoughts on PM Trudeau and what he is doing to Canadian oil?
2582 2018-11-29 19:48:05 Perhaps the most vacuous comment I've read all day, frankly.

I do have my flaws. Oddly enough, one of them isn't the inability to see a snake oil salesman when confronted with one. Another is not ending up the leader of a neo-Nazi racist organisation. That'll do for me.
2583 2018-11-29 19:47:45 More GOP alternative facts.
Gas prices went down to $1.50 under #Obama!
US oil production went way up under #Obama.
Just because you say some dumb mess doesn’t make it true.
Why don’t you talk about the #GOP accomplishment of giving #billionaires welfare?
2584 2018-11-29 19:47:39 So maybe Regan Smith wasn’t dropping gear oil after all before the race...
2585 2018-11-29 19:47:36 Favorite thing: changing the oil in my car and can’t get the filter off 
2586 2018-11-29 19:47:33 It is not legal if it is indoors in Florida.
It was one of the referendums we passed this November.
Indoor vaping was coupled with off-shore oil drilling. They paired so naturally?
2587 2018-11-29 19:47:33 E85 is less expensive but the gasoline/ethanol spread collapsed.  Both oil and ethanol are down.  You can also thank Scott Pruitt for all the small refinery waivers.
2588 2018-11-29 19:47:26 PUPPY! You know what helped heal Tashie’s hip? CBD oil. I can send you a link in DM once I’m home tonight.
2589 2018-11-29 19:46:56 said “well i’ll be fucked” and was asked if i said “whale oil beef hooked” and i hate americans

2591 2018-11-29 19:46:45 Sorry but you are incorrect, hemp (sativa) has high levels of CBD and (indica) has high levels of THC. Smoking Cannabis sativa will never get someone high and has no beneficial effects, however the oil from sativa is said to have beneficial effects, but still questionable.
2592 2018-11-29 19:46:42 Put oil on my hair after like years and now this shit ain’t coming off and the smell driving me crazy
2593 2018-11-29 19:46:39 Epa standards on pollutants in water. Save our oceans. From sugar industries to oil.
2594 2018-11-29 19:46:35 Leveling solo CV is not fun. So much ambushes & you have to run 3 DD frontlines. Mah oil is screaming
2595 2018-11-29 19:46:34 Took me a minute to realise you weren't using oil to wash yourself.
2596 2018-11-29 19:46:34 Desperation.
2597 2018-11-29 19:46:17 They don’t care about veterans until they NEED us to salute at a football game on TV or when we fill the numbers for their War for Oil.
2598 2018-11-29 19:46:11 Epstein is a #Mossad agent. He's good friends with another Mossad agent who helped Israel ship gas/oil from Iraq's oil fields (Peshemerga-controlled areas) following the Iraq war by helping them a pipeline; was involved in Iran Contra on Israel's behalf, and whose wife funded
2599 2018-11-29 19:46:06 Lol. Hey, I have some top notch us oil for sale, want some do ya?
2600 2018-11-29 19:46:03 @PowerLunch @MelissaLeeCNBC @BillGriffeth @CourtReagan @JackieDeAngelis I remembered last time #wti was significantly down, all your guests were wondering why consumers were NOT spending, instead the loss of #oil capex & layoffs was more impactful. So net negative for #USA.
2601 2018-11-29 19:46:00 Oil, he leaves one helluva stain in your driveway that never goes away...
2602 2018-11-29 19:45:54 Small drop in oil price, Nigeria's economy don dey shake
2603 2018-11-29 19:45:54 PATHETIC OBAMA. YOU CAN FOOL SOME PEOPLE SOME OF THE TIME, BUT NOT ALL THE ALL OF THE TIME. YOU TAKE CREDIT FOR EVERYTHING PRES TRUMP HAS DONE. YOU LEFT OIL ALONE, GAVE MONEY TO THE SAUDI'S. PROMISED TO CLOSE ALL COAL MINES. TO TAKE CREDIT FOR ECNOMY, STOCK MARKET. BAH ON YOU
2604 2018-11-29 19:45:48 Castor oil is a LIFE saver!!!
2605 2018-11-29 19:45:43 I am on board w/that
The initial gas hike 2 increase energy independence via making other sources more affordable would have led to a lower demand for foreign oil & lower oil cost as a result(The current #stayPuftPOTUS tried taking credit for lower gas prices Monday,which is)
2606 2018-11-29 19:45:32 @IbeKachikwu has raised the profile of the country within the geopolitical calculations of international oil politics. He has achieved this through his deft understanding and pushing Nigeria's interest within OPEC, while also raising the country's reserves. He is simply awesome.
2607 2018-11-29 19:45:26 Holy shit this dude just lives in the old stinky taint of the oil & gas industry
2608 2018-11-29 19:45:26 $AMRN Tell him about Vascepa.  Just tell him not to ever take mineral oil.  That stuff'll kill ya.
2609 2018-11-29 19:44:59 "Sat" actually. We delivered consensus recommendations with oil industry and community members on how to implement climate plan. Wish they were followed.
2610 2018-11-29 19:44:45 how many times a day will i see a qtrt of someone calling out a picture of food like bitch i get it that shit is motor oil move on

2612 2018-11-29 19:44:29 Jason Statham - The Transporter - Oil Slick
At least deserves consideration.
2613 2018-11-29 19:44:28 La franchise permettra -t-elle de transformer cette "transition" intellectuelle en "Révolution" dans le réel dans le cadre de principes démocratiques?
2614 2018-11-29 19:44:16 Paulie did the prep work. He was doing a year for contempt, and he had this wonderful system for doing the garlic. He used a razor, and he used to slice it so thin that he used to liquefy in the pan with just a little oil. It was a very good system. #moviequotes #goodfellas
2615 2018-11-29 19:44:12 Sammmneeee oil hella old
2616 2018-11-29 19:44:06 Why won’t @JustinTrudeau put tariffs on Saudi oil already?  This isn’t rocket science.
2617 2018-11-29 19:44:06 $SPY $DJI $USO #OIL  Jan. WTI oil gains $1.16, or 2.3%, to settle at $51.45/bbl
2618 2018-11-29 19:44:05 As eastern frontier of Islam Pak wants to break India but needs India for economic benefits as Islamised society with out oil is not a viable economic structure. Thus protect terrorists and promote trade policy @TarekFatah @TajinderBagga
2619 2018-11-29 19:43:57 I used to love shutting the pump off when people used these ‘tricks’ at the Esso, same as the guy who would always try to pump his truck full of furnace oil. The best was when they got out to check the fully pumped tank to only realize it was at 10 cents
2620 2018-11-29 19:43:45 @cafreeland Please let us know when this stated, Appendix 3, Section C10 and 11 are taken out of the #USMCA #NAFTA final draft and then maybe we'll stop bugging the shit out of you. We gained back our oil sovereignty to just give away our farming sovereignty. Not cool.
2621 2018-11-29 19:43:42 Yes indeed. USA has been spreading "democracy" by sponsoring head chopping jihadist terrorists. Very evil and very immoral. All in the name of oil. Vile, disgusting and a war crime.
2622 2018-11-29 19:43:34 The study is says to achieve 80% by 2030 100% by 2050. Do you think other politicians  that are bought by the oil and gas industry know more about the issue than she does?
2623 2018-11-29 19:43:23 Oil running will outweigh tax loss imo. $4 for me not sure if I’ll hold overnight lol
2624 2018-11-29 19:43:13 The same scientists like Ehrlich with the population bomb, the coming ice age in the 70s, or running out of oil?  Always some neo-malthusian doomsday scenario that fails.
2625 2018-11-29 19:43:12 Been in Walmart for an hour. An HOUR. I just asked for an oil change, what y’all niggas doing? Washing my car? Changing my tires?????
2626 2018-11-29 19:43:11 But the price of using such oil...Pollution of the environment by plastics and warming of the global climate.
2627 2018-11-29 19:43:09 CBD oil is godsent.
2628 2018-11-29 19:43:01 Britain and Norway have a lot in common: a vast coastline, oil reserves & hopeless at Eurovision. The Norwegian Blue parrot would also be a fitting mascot for Mrs May's Brexit plan. The great thing about western Europe is it's free of both Trump and Putin. Let's keep it that way.
2629 2018-11-29 19:42:57 My dads email used to contain his name followed by “dr.evil” (because he’s bald), but now it’s “dr. Safety”because he does safety in the oil fields 
2630 2018-11-29 19:42:44 Girls with kumatuu have a special place in my heart, plus I love looking fr their trouble 
2631 2018-11-29 19:42:19 Oil’s not going to come out the ground itself pal kin
2632 2018-11-29 19:42:17 Coworker diffuses cinnamon essential oil and I hear...”WHO THE HELL IS BURNING FIREBALL?!”

Glad I’m not the only one.
2633 2018-11-29 19:42:08 I hate when people say “omg California doesn’t know how to drive after it rains” like ??? No bitch we actually dont because we don’t know what to do if our car starts slipping on all of the oil that the rain is lifting up Thant’s been sitting there for months on end ????
2634 2018-11-29 19:42:04 I mean like a mat or a rug? Full rug yes a mat or runner no, also fear for flying hot oil on a rug in a kitchen
2635 2018-11-29 19:41:52 think oil has bottomed out though? would give it some more time, especially since tax loss season won't end for another few weeks. just my thoughts.
2636 2018-11-29 19:41:52 Yaaaayyyy kumatutuuuuuuuu 
2637 2018-11-29 19:41:52 The problem is that we only diversify during oil busts and we're set to vote in Jason Kenney, who will reverse all the progress we made on that front in the past 3 years, in a few months.
2638 2018-11-29 19:41:49 As a mother of a son with a severe nut, sesame, poppy and sunflower oil and seed allergy it is very worrying that companies don’t label their food properly! But what is even more worrying is the fact that people are not educated about allergies and cross contamination!!
2639 2018-11-29 19:41:47 OK. @exxon powers its oil extraction w/ #RenewableEnergy Progress? Https//goo.gl/uJm52p
2640 2018-11-29 19:41:43 I be using my oils for my body and hair. Shit be gone the next week in my house. now I use lotion and oil mixed for body.
2641 2018-11-29 19:41:37 Thank you Mr. President for influencing the decline in the price of oil and fuel ... There is a lot of speculation to sell gasoline to our companies and people!
Thanks
2642 2018-11-29 19:41:19 ANOTHER OBAMA LIE!!! Former president of Shell Oil Company John Hofmeister said former President Barack Obama had nothing to do with America’s increased oil production and actually frustrated many areas of the energy sector.
2643 2018-11-29 19:40:59 "Hello? This is Nojus from Lithuania. Would you be interested in buying Sakotis and Kibinai? We are trying to raise money to beat back our asshole Russian neigbor Vadim to stop parking tanks next to our fucking fence. Also we dont have oil in our country fyi American."
2644 2018-11-29 19:40:54 The communists in the democrat party want Putin to get Saudi Oil. Simple, figure it out.
2645 2018-11-29 19:40:53 Excellent soup, with pasta and a healthy quantity of parmesan and olive oil
2646 2018-11-29 19:40:51 speaking of cars I need to go check on my truck. service taking extra long on this oil change. tf ? nigga I work here lol
2647 2018-11-29 19:40:38 What's to debate? Bush was an oil man. Price of oil sky rocketed and he allied us with who best fit his needs. 911 a plane crashed into an empty wing of the pentagon and not cause much damage, but 2 planes in NY take down an entire block.
2648 2018-11-29 19:40:36 PSA: Be careful going to the bathroom if you use coconut oil as lotion on your legs. You may slip off the toilet.
2649 2018-11-29 19:40:28 Don't worry you'll soon come with oil company salary.
2650 2018-11-29 19:40:15 "prosperity for much of the world" right, bc people dying from pollution and poisioned water is so great. You do realize that oil and gas will run out soon right?
2651 2018-11-29 19:40:12 You weren't around when the Arabs cut off our oil supply. If you were, you would know that no amount of money could buy a gallon if you needed it on the wrong day. If the Saudis cut off our oil supply again, it would increase the price more like $2. A Jewish guy should k now that
2652 2018-11-29 19:40:08 ブレーキランプ5回点滅、ごま油のサイン。
2653 2018-11-29 19:39:53 Waiting in lucky star for an oil change rn and the cutest little chubby boy came in to buy a candy bar and some soda and was so damn sweet and respectful I could cry
2654 2018-11-29 19:39:44 Kilduff on oil is Gartman on anything
2655 2018-11-29 19:39:43 Lotta oil refineries in Louisiana.
2656 2018-11-29 19:39:40 Thomas mulclair was on CTV this morning and his message was that there should be no help for Alberta and that our commitment to the Paris accord should come before anything else.Sad and infuriating to think that some think that Alberta and the oil sector are expendable
2657 2018-11-29 19:39:29 Damn I have to do my oil change rn
2658 2018-11-29 19:39:13 THE OIL THAT ALL RAN OUT OF THE FOOLISH VIRGINS IS THE INNER ANOINTIN TO BE ALWAYS IN U AS U READ BIBLE GET THE WORD IN U AND IT IN TURN BECOMES A LIVING RIVER OF LIFE IN U ALL-U TAKE IT IN AS SEED WORD OF GOD AND U MED.ON IT-U GROW IN FAITH-
2659 2018-11-29 19:39:07 Nooooo, @suziesgoodfats!! PALM OIL??? Guhhhh, I loved your bars, but now this one has to be my last. Please consider discontinuing the use of #PalmOil! Such a shame. Sadly... #boycotting.
2660 2018-11-29 19:39:04 Try living in Oklahoma with fracking-induced earthquakes every day & keeping a straight face while NPR tells you that cattle do more harm to the environment than the oil industry.
2661 2018-11-29 19:39:01 Is Castor oil the most effective way to grow eyebrows?
2662 2018-11-29 19:39:00 not wanting to take your car in for an oil change because you know they’re gonna give you a list of things wrong with it >>>>
2663 2018-11-29 19:38:57 So basically they want what all Fascists want.
2664 2018-11-29 19:38:50 Yes, it did seem like they had oil on their hands because the ball was slip sliding away from them quite often.
2665 2018-11-29 19:38:48 I absolutely agree with @ShahNafisa. If PPP can turn vodka into honey & olive oil in one day why can't Imran Khan deliver on his promises in a hundred days?

2667 2018-11-29 19:38:35 Helen, I agree with your sentiment.
However, with solar & wind power, as well as electric vehicles, oil & gas are declining industries.
On the other hand, battery storage (electro-chemistry), is a high-value and rapidly growing sector.
2668 2018-11-29 19:38:32 SOME AS PRIESTS WERE AS ANOINTED WITH OIL-THE ANOINTING AS THIS FALSE ONE ALL OTHERS WITHOUT ANY ANOINTING IN EM DON'T KNOW WHAT ANOINTING IS AT ALL-ITS ADHERENT POWER COMES FORM GOD ANOINTING U ONLY-NO OIL THIS INSANITY U MUSN'T FALL EVER FOR-
2669 2018-11-29 19:38:31 The farmers can not move their grain due to capacity, how are they suppose to move more oil???
2670 2018-11-29 19:38:22 Blocked and muted most of them.

#EOCFHIParty #yegdt #yeg
2672 2018-11-29 19:38:17 So one day one time I'll be no more when this reality occur to my mind, I calm my nerves down to rethink what's really worth it in life.
2673 2018-11-29 19:38:14 One has to pay close focus to what oil media pitches on the headlines.  There had been a number of il proposed subjects of news to serve certain agendas... Attention!
2674 2018-11-29 19:38:07 Definitely should get one, I'll take that over a 5 game suspension had he launched the stick at them. Flames can't handle a long losing streak right now had Smith been forced to take over as #1 again.
2675 2018-11-29 19:38:01 THIS HE SPOKE EVIL OF GOD U ALL CAN HEAR WITH EARS-WE TO JUDGE WHAT COMES OUT OF A MOUTH-ALL WICKED/FALSE TEACHERS/THE ONES DENY CHRIST/ THEY R WITHOUT HOLY SPIRIT-U NEED ALL KNOW JESUS OR NO OTHER OF ALL BIBLE EVER HAD ANY OIL COME OUT OF ANY PART OF EM-
2676 2018-11-29 19:38:01 Chip shops fry seafood in same oil as fish. Must be stopped.#seafoodallergy
2677 2018-11-29 19:37:36 Then why is global oil consumption growing every year? Or is that a reality you are simply choosing to ignore?
2678 2018-11-29 19:37:29 Well you definitely have a point with clogging up traffic. Truckers making all that money means that the people selling oil aren’t making it, so they won’t ship that way.
2679 2018-11-29 19:37:13 
-always carry your own condoms 
-use ice to cover hickeys 
-Don’t use pull out method. There’s always a risk. 
-baby oil breaks condoms 
-dont pressure yourself. Do it when you think it’s right.
2680 2018-11-29 19:37:13 But yea still swallowing all that Saudi oil.  And selling them weapons.  
2681 2018-11-29 19:37:04 So I’m continuing to boycott palm oil & I would urge everyone else to as well. The approach of not boycotting palm oil is not helping the forests & orangutans @mikeyslezak @GeorgeMonbiot @robathon16 @Lizmont007 @martinrev21
2682 2018-11-29 19:37:00 Just tried the cardboard with pancakes  motor oil next
2683 2018-11-29 19:37:00 Oil
2684 2018-11-29 19:36:55 cont. 3) Take these supplements: Chromium Picolinate, Cinnamon, Fish Oil, and Bitter Melon Extract.
2685 2018-11-29 19:36:51 We just got some new *Hood Oil - Blueberry Headband*
2686 2018-11-29 19:36:49 I don't follow the oil market as much ... where do you see that?
2687 2018-11-29 19:36:38 Can we stop saying “East Canada” and “west Canada” we actual just mean “Ontario” and “Alberta”. The hard times facing these oil and factory workers has been the reality for much of the country my entire life.
2688 2018-11-29 19:36:23 Yea, this is true...although I heard he may get a fine or something...I think is what Dreger said this morn on sports radio.
2689 2018-11-29 19:36:22 The capacity in which she appeared, as a compliant voice, is one of the problems. The fact that if she really drinks her own snake oil then she believes it matters not what we do because our economic fortunes lie in the hands of God is supremely relevant.
2690 2018-11-29 19:36:14 God is saying this 
President Donald J Trump are oil wells we'll start flowing again better than ever old dried ones will start flowing
2691 2018-11-29 19:36:14 Getting an oil change and new tires today
2692 2018-11-29 19:36:12 it’s not oil it’s face gloss
2693 2018-11-29 19:36:06 Delicious oil sponges are no good for us? Shocking
2694 2018-11-29 19:36:05 From cyclical perspective risk begins to increase dramatically once 10 Yrs UST yield rises above 3 %.... currently 3.044....very interesting to see if touches 3.5. Can Fed really take that risk in the back drop of rate of change witnessed in autos, housing, oil, semis etc.
2695 2018-11-29 19:36:04 Its the oil slick thing that takes it way too far imo...
2696 2018-11-29 19:36:04 But, presidents only have so much effect on any aspect of oil and gas. So giving credit for all of that is meh...
2697 2018-11-29 19:36:01 
-spray vanilla on the inside of your thighs for a pleasing smell 
-mix honey and coconut oil and rub it in areas (not ) where your partner might kiss you. It gives a good taste
-Always pee after sex 
-Don’t use feline washes

2700 2018-11-29 19:35:46 Did you know that popcorn are normally fried in the same pot,in the same oil,at the same time, and under the same heat conditions, but they do not all pop at the same time. When flood comes fish eat ants, and when flood recedes, ants eat fish. On time matters.
2701 2018-11-29 19:35:43 I use to borrow my ex's car just so I could take it to change the oil, rotate tires, do an inspection, top up fluids... Small gesture to make life a little easier...
2702 2018-11-29 19:35:34 That awesome moment when you move home, return to work and oil hits $10 a barrel. How many days until notley is out again????
2703 2018-11-29 19:35:30 The best quality oil is the secret oil 
2704 2018-11-29 19:35:30 The well-oiled machine seems to be running on peak oil right now.
2705 2018-11-29 19:35:24 @realsamseiden Mr Sam oil going up exactly in the demand level you mention yesterday. Congratulations
2706 2018-11-29 19:35:17 Couldn’t agree more with this!!! It’s not gluten free if it’s cooked in the same oil as gluten containing products!
2707 2018-11-29 19:35:14 I came for 1 oil change but they said I needed 3 more thingys... see this is why I drive around with the radio turned up pretending like my car don’t need nothing 
2708 2018-11-29 19:35:12 Nafisa Sba did you looked at your father? How was his response after drinking Honey and Olive oil. PPP does not have right to ask IK govt what he did in 100 day. Can I ask a question what you did in Sindh i  10 years. Have u seen Karachi?????
2709 2018-11-29 19:35:06 CBD oil is good for that apparently
2710 2018-11-29 19:34:59 How have they benefitted? Oil? Sanctions? You have no idea what you're talking about. Laughable. He won, get over it!
2711 2018-11-29 19:34:58 And that we’d be out the EU if we voted no. And that we would have no oil. And that we could receive more fiscal power to run our country. And then agreed with the bedroom tax, agreed to take their winter fuel allowance, free travel with Tories. Labour have mitigated NOTHING.
2712 2018-11-29 19:34:52 #Oil #OOTT #WTI
WTI is falling like a rock now. It has dropped 80+ pts in a short timeframe. The last buyer pulled the plug on WTI after the settlement.
2713 2018-11-29 19:34:49 Cancel NordStream2 and also not buying oil from Iran ? And put some sanctions on Saudi Arabia too I suppose ? At some point we will have to choose I m afraid...
2714 2018-11-29 19:34:47 Ok, but have you used algae oil for your plantains yet? Lol
2715 2018-11-29 19:34:41 I loved this episode so, so much. @ACTBrigitte is an epic and inspiring FORCE of a woman. But, she lost me with the whole "we didn't invade Afghantistan or Iraq for oil" bit. We invaded to uplevel their education and infrastructure? We invaded as a humanitarian effort? Huh?
2716 2018-11-29 19:34:38 I bet more than 50% of #pvamu females need a oil change or new tires
2717 2018-11-29 19:34:35 Obama must have had a "magic wand"? He now wants credit for the booming economy that he said couldn't do any better? Remeber how he blocked oil companies from drilling? Remember the Republican slogan "drill baby drill"? That was US Obama...the republicans... not YOU. Sit down!
2718 2018-11-29 19:34:35 Lol! I ended up mixing thieves oil with a little bit of peppermint oil. And it helped enough for me to be able to fall asleep,
2719 2018-11-29 19:34:33 I want his curls. I imagine they smell like coconut oil 
2720 2018-11-29 19:34:31 I do feel like the dollar/oil/housing/core PCE data is pretty hefty at this point and we’ll need some really strong data elsewhere to keep the Fed on this course.
2721 2018-11-29 19:34:30 Palm oil  que también lo usan pa’ la Nutella
2722 2018-11-29 19:34:27 From Good Samaritan parable Book of Luke: "When he saw him, he was moved with compassion, came to him, & bound up his wounds, pouring on expensive oil & wine. He set him on his own animal, & brought him to an inn, & took care of him." Do you claim to be a Christian, Rep. Massie?
2723 2018-11-29 19:34:22 Cause it’s factually incorrect... they’ve won nowhere near as many leagues. Football didn’t start since the oil money 
2724 2018-11-29 19:34:18 I just slathered my ear lobes, hands and elbows in vitamin e oil and I feel like a new bitch
2725 2018-11-29 19:34:12 You’re probably using protein in your conditioner and it’s protein buildup. Also your hair seems fine, so you need to clarify more often to avoid buildup. A light oil is argon oil or grape seed oil, for moisturizing I like to use olive oil on my head
2726 2018-11-29 19:34:09 Getting tired of dodging ripped bin bags, takeaway oil drums and dog shit twice a day.
2727 2018-11-29 19:34:08 I’m an idiot and left $5 in my car and after I got my oil changed it was missing...and they over charged me but I called up there they’re pretending I wasn’t there??? Thanks.
2728 2018-11-29 19:34:07 So many things I need to get before the end of the year(adult stuff like new tires, smog check, oil change, new license,etc) but I have $50 in my bank account right now, so I don’t know what imma do with my life 
2729 2018-11-29 19:34:05 We just got some new *Hood Oil - Black Cherry Cheesecake*
2730 2018-11-29 19:34:03 Trump: I built up the gas and oil companies here in the states.
Liberals: Boo, hiss. You're the worst. You hate the environment.
Obama: Actually, that was me that built up those jobs.
Same Liberals: Obama is the greatest. Thank God for your hard work and efforts
2731 2018-11-29 19:34:03 deforestation has even worsened with the expansion of palm oil plantations
2732 2018-11-29 19:33:45 What free market are you referring to? Canada is the only major oil producer without a geopolitical strategy to market their product effectively. We actually actively obstruct selling it. It’s inane and damaging to our own economy. 
2733 2018-11-29 19:33:45 However Saudi oil continues to flow into Canada while AB suffers  #cdnpoli
2734 2018-11-29 19:33:20 how many essential and CBD oil do I have to consume until I myself am essentially an oil
2735 2018-11-29 19:33:16 Tea tree oil! Put it on your acne trust me
2736 2018-11-29 19:33:08 All of us, even your drama queen blocker of life , uwar rashin San gaskiya taught u sense 
2737 2018-11-29 19:32:58 We just got some new *Hood Oil - Conspiracy Kush*
2738 2018-11-29 19:32:52 bio oil beb
2739 2018-11-29 19:32:47 This mint almond oil is making my hair look so healthy 
2740 2018-11-29 19:32:44 Speculation drove the price down during the time Obama was in office. OPEC not happy with US fracking. Hence tried to put the Fracking Industry out of business with cheep oil. That also put a lot of Machine shops out of business in Houston. We lost a lot of good machinist.
2741 2018-11-29 19:32:29 #OIL º Acaba de tocar esta semana en 49.41 su directriz alcista de largo plazo y no le veo por el momento que vaya a seguir cayendo. Entrará en un lateral y si los grandes traders lo marean, puede escalar más adelante. Precio actual 51.68 $OIL #OOTT
2742 2018-11-29 19:32:24 Wait what? Which castor oil u using?
2743 2018-11-29 19:32:07 Chimichurri: one bunch cilantro, one bunch Italian parsley, 3-5 garlic cloves, salt, olive oil, oregano and red wine vinegar. Pulse in food processor. Adjust to taste. Serve with..basically anything but I like steak, salmon, asparagus
2744 2018-11-29 19:32:02 He's english is deformed, we know DA and education is water and oil.
2745 2018-11-29 19:31:46 A sister who has lost her (corporate) job wants to sell #Rice #Sugar #Cannedtomatoes #CannedFish #Oil and the etc, and is asking to link up with those who import or deal with this. Any leads?
2746 2018-11-29 19:31:34 Is he joking. He did allow America to produce oil. He must be joking
2747 2018-11-29 19:31:33 Please take an economics class before making some pretty incorrect statements.  What everlasting war are you speaking of?  If your talking about the BS in the middle east that's a fight over keeping our wealth (oil prices being in dollars not something else).
2748 2018-11-29 19:31:25 You can add a few drops of our Oreganol P-73 to super charge this shooter! We were actually the company to re-invigorate the public to the AMAZING power of oregano back in the day-- so you can't find a better Oil of Oregano product than ours!
2749 2018-11-29 19:31:16 We just got some new *Hood Oil - Wonder Goo*
2750 2018-11-29 19:31:14 Heh Rich........how do you fuel that car? Saudi oil coming into BC by tanker?
2751 2018-11-29 19:31:12 "Cannabis oil from Canopy Growth made with an indica-dominant hybrid strain that has very strong THC potency." In much larger type for headline: 
"Indica Oil (30 mg/ml THC, 0.7 mg/ml CBD)"
2752 2018-11-29 19:31:09 This sheer madness & corruption by the Traffic police,they wanted you to oil their pockets but it appears you could not understand.
This is how rotten this country called Kenya is.
2753 2018-11-29 19:30:42 travis scott's real name is Jacques Berman Webster II 
which sounds like a red dead side quest where you rob an oil tycoon with a big hat
2754 2018-11-29 19:30:40 @JeffFlake You could not be more aptly named.....glad I didn't thank you yesterday.....can't wait until your gone! You speak beautifully but they are just lovely words never supported by action. You just as big a snake oil salesman as Trump. #Resist
2755 2018-11-29 19:30:37 We'd recommend putting out several types of feed (black oil sunflower seeds, thistle, suet, etc.) which will help attract a variety of birds. Maybe nectar in the spring/summer, too. Mix up the feeder locations and be patient — if you feed them, they will come 
2756 2018-11-29 19:30:36 Are they palm oil free ? That’s much more important.
2757 2018-11-29 19:30:36 We're always poisoning mother Earth with bitumen repairing the roads the oil toting semis destroy with their heavy weight and drug addicted drivers.
2758 2018-11-29 19:30:30 that's exactly what he's talking about though and he's right. They successfully kept us in their back pocket, getting dirt cheap oil and  then turning around and selling that plus their own production for a profit. Suckers indeed..!

2760 2018-11-29 19:30:15 Things I'm newly hip to and have decided to stan:
1) Apricot oil -- why didnt anybody tell me about apricot oil?! My scalp and my braids smell SO GOOD
2) Online grocery ordering
3) Billie Eilish, she go hard idc idc 
4) buying cool coffee mugs but not drinking coffee from them
2761 2018-11-29 19:30:13 What’s next?
Further drop in oil price !!
2762 2018-11-29 19:30:09 If hemp (sativa) isnt legal its for the claims made to help heal. if it faces any issues with legality it's with regards to the wild claims people are making about CBD Oil. That would require legislation to become a legal OTC product and backed by the FDA. Likely wouldnt happen.
2763 2018-11-29 19:30:09 Hahahaha well played, i was so glad he didnt actually launch his broken stick at the refs like it looked like he was going to. Stupid move by him.
2764 2018-11-29 19:30:07 If #Opec doesn't win, eventually it'll lead to social unrest in #MiddleEast when govts couldn't pay wages; so big incentive to. Now if only US shale @US_OGA realise that "earning less by pumping more" isn't a winning strategy, that's why I don't invest in US #oil, bad mgt. #wti
2765 2018-11-29 19:30:06 #Alexa, Play Red State #TalkRadio @redstatetalk @ScottAdamsShow - 112918: #Russia #China #Pelosi #Mueller #Cohen #Oil #Fed #Corsi #G20 redst
2766 2018-11-29 19:29:59 LOL Totally spineless, stop buying their oil if you want to make a statement.
That will never happen because it would stop the flow of Saudi money in to the Trudeau foundation.
2767 2018-11-29 19:29:51 Hey Justin, there are francophones here in Alberta, how about supporting them by ending your deliberate attack on the oil industry and their jobs? #canpoli
2768 2018-11-29 19:29:51 @RepAlexMooney A big Thank You for fighting to free our markets from the US Treasury ESF & their war against commodities & natural price discovery. Repeal of Glass-Steagall & the Uptick Rule as well as collusion Fed/Treasury is hurting oil producers, farmers, miners, investors.
2769 2018-11-29 19:29:50 Had to get the back rotors replaced on my car last time I got an oil change and now I have to get them replaced in the front and get a new paint job all over my car hahahha I hate cars
2770 2018-11-29 19:29:39 Peppermint oil or vapor rub. Massage ok temples and neck.
2771 2018-11-29 19:29:39 Eating Filipino food at home is like drinking a cup full of oil. Fck.
2772 2018-11-29 19:29:37 Black soap and castor oil THANK ME LATER
2773 2018-11-29 19:29:33 3 things that I dont like:
- ketchup 
- people that think they are superior to others
- taking my car for oil changes
2774 2018-11-29 19:29:31 probably fleas
put some coconut oil to soothe it...that's what some people do
2775 2018-11-29 19:29:28 Motor oil looks delicious
2776 2018-11-29 19:29:24 So is Dawn dish soap actually taking a duckling and covering it in crude oil to film these commercials or what? @ProcterGamble help me understand. #ThursdayThoughts
2777 2018-11-29 19:29:19 Before Etihad green

Hurrah for oil
2778 2018-11-29 19:29:07 why did you keep a jar in your room? were u eating plain coconut oil
2779 2018-11-29 19:28:58 Who does make up for the Fergusons? They poured a whole lot of oil on this chap. It doesnt look like blood at all
2780 2018-11-29 19:28:57 You ain’t lyin. If only my mechanic rooomate would just do my oil changes for me
2781 2018-11-29 19:28:54 I just want a pair of ripped jeans & a custom nude abstract oil painting for Christmas
2782 2018-11-29 19:28:52 Most #Oil and #Gas companies rely on paper-based systems to keep track of products. Get ahead of the game, save time with Infochip.
2783 2018-11-29 19:28:49 Tons. BP bought Standard Oil of Ohio (Sohio) many, many years ago.
2784 2018-11-29 19:28:48 somehow oil pressuring some Fx pairs.
2785 2018-11-29 19:28:47 #Oil - Someone didn't want a > $60 Brent close.
2786 2018-11-29 19:28:41 @SenMikeLee @LindseyGrahamSC @SenJackReed @JoeBiden Please someone explain to @realDonaldTrump that low oil price bankrupt US oil shale producers. Otherwise I must start to think at protests against irresponsible oil prices policy. These protest will be numerous.
2787 2018-11-29 19:28:41 Have these got palm oil in them?
2788 2018-11-29 19:28:24 The Scotiabank report on Alberta's oil pricing problem that all politicians and media are quoting has been discredited. The pricing problem is not nearly as severe as stated, nor is it costing us $80 billion a year. But it makes great headlines. #cdnpoli #abpoli
2789 2018-11-29 19:28:15 E be like say na true ooo...
All the rice will now start colouring jollof rice colour 
They can as well use palm oil to mix with the rice, that gives a better coloration 
2790 2018-11-29 19:28:11 Make sure you don't use tea tree oil near the cat! Its so bad for cats and dogs
2791 2018-11-29 19:28:05 Surprised to be hearing this from a Registered Dietitian today. 

Don’t consume saturated fat. 

Do consume canola oil. 

Am I way off, or is this super outdated?
2792 2018-11-29 19:28:02 Boycotting palm oil will actually lead to less demand & therefore less incentive for even more forest to be bulldozed for palm oil. The land value will decrease so it will become cheaper to buy for the purposes of restoring forest by orgs such as @orangulandtrust.
2793 2018-11-29 19:28:01 Name the clean Energy that the world is going to switch to, WITHOUT the used of oil and gas products and Minning???  Solar panels and Windmills don’t make themselves and there not reliable. The wind don’t blow 24-7 and same as daylight. What kind of footprint does those require?
2794 2018-11-29 19:28:00 You gonna spend $1000 for like an oil change
2795 2018-11-29 19:27:54 Should we stop buying oil from them if this confirmed?
2796 2018-11-29 19:27:45 Anxiety has been absolutely out of control recently but I’ve started bringing out a small bottle of frankincense oil with me to either inhale or steam/inhale and it has helped me a lot. At least I feel like I have some control back
2797 2018-11-29 19:27:33 Spoke to everyone at home except my younger sister today. Boarding house will always remain a torture to me
2798 2018-11-29 19:27:26 SEEMS JACK IS STATING TO REALIZE THE DEPTH OF MUELLES INVESTIGATION
@JackPosobiec
 56m
Breaking: Mueller is investigating Russia's sale of a 19.5% stake of Rosneft, their largest oil company, and any ties to Trump associates Carter Page and George Papadopoulos
2799 2018-11-29 19:27:20 Thanks both. Moving onward, does this one-off event all spill into the table of oil consumption in the US this year? Because there's kind of a wild disconnect between flat gasoline demand YOY and "other oils." Thoughts welcome.
2800 2018-11-29 19:26:53 he is taking credit because if it was not for how far he depressed the oil industry it may have already flourished  but since he did it is now a boom.We have just started to understand how liberals think and speak. Trump is 2 weeks ahead of them all the time. they cannot keep up
2801 2018-11-29 19:26:49 Nothing was “booming” during the Obama administration.  And how did we become a top oil producer when he shut down every proposed pipeline that came across his desk?   His delusions of grandeur never ceases to amaze me.
2802 2018-11-29 19:26:48 I guess the Irving family vetoed the idea of banning the import of Saudi oil. What was done today is symbolic, banning their oil or even putting a tariff on it would actually send a message. Now everytime someone fills their tank they are helping fund Saudi atrocities.
2803 2018-11-29 19:26:39 he is taking credit because if it was not for how far he depressed the oil industry it may have already flourished  but since he did it is now a boom.We have just started to understand how liberals think and speak.

2804 2018-11-29 19:26:36 Yeh thanks for building that Oil pipeline ... oh wait a minute ...you tried to kill the pipeline.
2805 2018-11-29 19:26:30 Next time ima moo with oil and watch her struggle
2806 2018-11-29 19:26:21 Have yet to get an oil change without calling my Dad asking if I need all the stuff they’re trying to sell me
2807 2018-11-29 19:26:13 My van is leaking oil anyone know how to help?
2808 2018-11-29 19:26:09 this girl waiting for coffee is fighting with her boyfriend about oil transport like really yelling at each other
2809 2018-11-29 19:26:03 Damn I can't catch a break woke up to carbon fiber hood stolen off my car this morning and now the oil pump failing in my daily 
2810 2018-11-29 19:25:48 best, tastiest oil by far
no contest
2811 2018-11-29 19:25:47 Chris, don’t worry & stay where you are. I’ve alerted the authorities, just hang tight and the wahmbulance will be there shortly.
2812 2018-11-29 19:25:45 did a documentary on food presentation just air or something bc I keep seeing ppl excitedly talking about motor oil on pancakes etc as if they just galaxy brained on this topic
2813 2018-11-29 19:25:41 Well the current model of ‘human welfare’ as it stands with an exponentially increasing popn is palm oil plantations apparently. And that is valued more highly than the rainforests. So yes even the conservation organisations apparently are urging everyone not to boycott palm oil.
2814 2018-11-29 19:25:38 he is taking credit because if it was not for how far he depressed the oil industry it may have already flourished  but since he did it is now a boom.We have just started to understand how liberals think and speak. Trump is 2 weeks ahead of them all the time. they cannot keep up
2815 2018-11-29 19:25:34 Some cardboard and motor oil would be clutch rn!
2816 2018-11-29 19:25:26 The US has supported Saudi Arabia before Trump, but Obama tried to work things out with Iran. They're also crazy now that MBS (Mohamed Bone Saw) is in charge. 

Oil is the only reason to care but we need to stop using it b/c climate change. So doesn't matter.
2817 2018-11-29 19:25:24 he is taking credit because if it was not for how far he depressed the oil industry it may have already flourished  but since he did it is now a boom.We have just started to understand how liberals think and speak. Trump is 2 weeks ahead of them all the time. they cannot keep up
2818 2018-11-29 19:25:13 These minutes are a month old, big falls in autos, housing, oil, and lumber in that period. Powell was just joining the party
2819 2018-11-29 19:24:55 Exxon officials approached Obama in 2008 about oil and gas production and Obama's agenda to go renewables. That policy failed big time. Because of the cost to consumers. Fracking was just starting up. Exxon knew it would lower the cost for oil. Obama tried to stop it.
2820 2018-11-29 19:24:48 Also if I don’t get my oil changed tomorrow someone beat me up
2821 2018-11-29 19:24:45 @bandholz I can't wait to but the ranger oil believe it's called. This year was the first time I wanted to grow my beard. I watch your YouTube videos and that encouraged me to grow my beard. Also I cant wait to get my beard comb. Omg I'm excited.
2822 2018-11-29 19:24:21 Amazing how people throw capital/money away in oil

2825 2018-11-29 19:24:02 What a Joke !!!!!Obama kept telling us we were out of oil and we would be out of the oriole by the end of the decade!!! No he’s trying to take credit for.  @realDonaldTrump pro energy  initiative

2829 2018-11-29 19:23:52 Every time I come home the first thing my dad says is “get your oil changed lately”
2830 2018-11-29 19:23:39 Shouldn’t they be suing the King of All Fossil Fuels @BarackObama. He gleefully takes credit “that was me” for the surge in US oil production!
2831 2018-11-29 19:23:37 Yes as an individual I can't invest in Venezuela oil. But I understand to maintain a national economy rather than my own multinational venture borders are essential to maintain the value of a fiat currency
2832 2018-11-29 19:23:34 She supported salmond in his lies about the oil bonus and his stupid white paper ! How much did she know about the complaints about salmond why should we trust her judgement?
2833 2018-11-29 19:23:33 Lol they know her that's why, I saw her Instagram post, she's a slay queen really
2834 2018-11-29 19:23:28 Int Oil prices after 29 October are to be used for the calculation of sale price of oil in Dec.
Given the decrease in the market, why OGRA is reported to have suggested an increase? 
ECC better look into calculations carefully.Prices should go down

2836 2018-11-29 19:23:20 Just because we were dumb enough to let Obama make mistakes in the Middle East doesn’t mean we’ll stay dumb and let trump do it. The military establishment must be kept in check no matter which party is in charge. And We’re down bowing down to Saudi Arabia to keep oil low
2837 2018-11-29 19:23:12 Ok ,I tried making squash muffins using coconut flour and tapioca flour! They seem too moist! What can do ? I also used coconut oil and milk! Duck eggs too. Any suggestions?
2838 2018-11-29 19:23:08 You forget the ultimate legends Karl Alzner and "The venerable Superior Propane God Nick "The Greatest Oil King" Suzuki".
2839 2018-11-29 19:23:04 There are plenty of oil rigs that might be useful 
2840 2018-11-29 19:23:04 I broke a bottle herself's cinnamon essential oil and now I can't get the smell off my hands. And now I'm sneezing.

2843 2018-11-29 19:22:51 How about when Freeland criticized Saudi Arabia a few weeks ago for human rights and they put sanctions on us and called their people back?  This don’t buy Saudi oil is less hateful. Yet Saudi Arabia deserves both. The difference is the left said one the right the other
2844 2018-11-29 19:22:48 83% of all Scottish exports (non oil) don’t go to the EU
2845 2018-11-29 19:22:42 A green haired girl came in our class to show us her essential oil/study techniques and then got pissed when I asked her which one gets you the most fucked up

2851 2018-11-29 19:22:12 Today I've looked at atleast 10 different places to get a job at and I'm getting my oil changed, it really is the week of getting my life together and becoming an adult
2852 2018-11-29 19:22:11 Perhaps if you plant it and water with coconut oil something might grow
2853 2018-11-29 19:22:03 This isn’t possible. I was told our vetting process is fantastic.

2856 2018-11-29 19:21:46 I remember when I first learned these. the oil thing grossed me out more than anything to the point that I don't even trust syrup LOL
2857 2018-11-29 19:21:43 When i see you slithering i cut the grass and oil the soil so the grass wont grow again
2858 2018-11-29 19:21:39 @jkenney Jason the last thing that our oil industry needs is more Government orders on how to run there business. We need a pipe from Fort mac to Hudson Bay.
2859 2018-11-29 19:21:33 nothing on this planet smells better than coconut oil dont @ me
2860 2018-11-29 19:21:26 just got my muffler fixed, about to get my oil changed, light, air, and put some subroofers, and more speakers in. I’m tryna have my shit bussing i be tryna jug fr. I’m debating if i want tent tho.
2861 2018-11-29 19:21:20 Why does morehouse smell like some horrible oil
2862 2018-11-29 19:21:16 So are we 
However 
Solar is no where near ready for use in hot-humid-dusty climates 
+We don’t have enough wind 
I think a viable renewable energy solution will not be reached before more efficient engines 

Also 
If not burned for fuel 
Oil will always be used in manufacturing
2863 2018-11-29 19:21:12 Did we take the oil?  No.  The fake news about WMD's was due to the bumbling ineptitude of Robert Mueller, who has made a career of being wrong.
2864 2018-11-29 19:21:09 Sesame oil is MY OIL. I didn’t even know I wanted an Oil but I have it now and it’s so good with everything thank you amen. Also if you just read “oil” over and over again it stops being a real word.
2865 2018-11-29 19:21:06 Hot water eucalyptus oil. How water on top disperse better inhale congestion
2866 2018-11-29 19:21:05 Cut it out my car ain’t even at 15,000 miles yet and I definitely get a oil change every 5,000 miles 
2867 2018-11-29 19:21:04 It’s okay to disagree. I’ll leave it at that. But The Spirit “oil” is the only way to enter at the gate. Scripture say, no private interpretation is needed,anymore. No mysteries.Jesus  Said God will send a comforter,& it’s not man. Flesh is of the flesh&Spirit is of the spirit.
2868 2018-11-29 19:20:57 A great reason to use #turmeric, #coconutoil, and vanilla or peppermint oil as your toothpaste instead!
2869 2018-11-29 19:20:44 Quoting my first @warmflowuk oil boilers this weekend, one internal heat only and an external heat only. Heard good things about them 
2870 2018-11-29 19:20:37 Along with how impossible it’s become for the province to get oil to market, I think some of this is timing and optics. It’s baffling to me that it’s ok for AB to buy trains to get oil to market but is regulated out of twinning a pipeline.
2871 2018-11-29 19:20:35 What a liar he was against drilling off shore and against the keystone pipeline. It hurt the steel industry in my great city of Lorain with are steel plant that made pipe for the oil industry.
2872 2018-11-29 19:20:28 Lmao why do people oil they booty before they have sex
2873 2018-11-29 19:20:23 It's oil sands not tar sands to be more specific
2874 2018-11-29 19:20:19 In 2017, The Hacienda announces that all pricing for oil and oil by-products are deregulated effective today.
2875 2018-11-29 19:20:13 Hybrid will not pick up massively. The market will move directly to electric from oil. Leaps, not steps:)
2876 2018-11-29 19:20:13 Instead of having an oil pipeline, what if we had a giant water pipeline that sourced California with water? And if it leaked... well, it’s just water. #crazyidea #CaliforniaWildfires
2877 2018-11-29 19:20:10 How about we ban Saudi oil and build energy east!  Awesome idea which I’m sure you will support.
2878 2018-11-29 19:20:03 Jist like an oil change, a grilled cheese should take at least 15 minutes to make
2879 2018-11-29 19:20:03 This gov bought a pipeline from Kinder Morgan, yet can’t tell the taxpayers when construction will begin. And now, the gov has brought forward an Economic Update with almost $600M for the media the year before an election, and nothing for oil and gas workers.
2880 2018-11-29 19:19:56 Senator Neufeld asked @SenHarder why the gov has stood by while our oil and gas sector saw tens of billions in private-sector investment leave our country, taking away thousands of jobs for middle-class Canadians.
2881 2018-11-29 19:19:38 This day in Midstream History:
11/29/1999 - PAA reported unauthorized trading activity by employee in crude oil trading operations, result in $160mm loss.  PAA cut its distribution that quarter and did not pay out dist. to subordinated units, restarted dist. growth thereafter...

2893 2018-11-29 19:18:37 What is "bugging" (anonymous troll) is not the thousands of unemployed oil patch workers or the millions of revenue lost daily it is that an academic corrected an inaccuracy about how much bottled water sells for compared to oil. This is twitter, summarized in one tweet.

2903 2018-11-29 19:18:00 "Pretend oil has a future" ???
Better take a look at future demand estimates!
2904 2018-11-29 19:17:57 How exactly is palm oil ‘deforestation free’? That is an absolutely absurd policy position. No wonder the rainforests of SE Asia are in such a dire position. If conservation orgs are actually in support of palm oil... Unilever, Wilmar & Pepsi must be chuffed.
2905 2018-11-29 19:17:56 My point is that just because it's a complex model doesn't mean it's innacurate as you suggested. Even so we shouldnt risk all of civilization for the sake of profits, oil/coal, plastic bullshit, etc...

2912 2018-11-29 19:17:06 if the province is going to tie up the entire rail system with oil shipments why not just plop the cars next to the tracks weld them together and call it a train instead of a pipeline,  this is insanity,
2913 2018-11-29 19:16:59 if I have a ton of food leftover and there’s something here with peanuts or peanut oil in if, just leave it at home is what I mean, because nut allergies are so common. Your biggest fight will probably be lactose intolerance

2926 2018-11-29 19:15:50 “Who’s  paying for all of this? Every single Canadian. Oil sands growth,  without sufficient approved takeaway capacity, has caused the problem.”  Whitecap Resources CEO Grant Fagerheim, BNN, November 14, 2018)
2927 2018-11-29 19:15:37 So, it's Islamophobic not to buy Saudi oil? Do they buy Can oil? Is that Christophobic or Kafirphobic? They finance mosques in Canada yet you can't build a church or even talk about any religion except Islam in SA. Hypocrites with money
2928 2018-11-29 19:15:34 é que esse tea tree oil é a mesma coisa que melaleuca haha e melaleuca a gente compra bem mais barato no mercadão 
2929 2018-11-29 19:15:32 -> the movement is clearly about wealth distribution and class réthoric (the question is about oil prices, city vs rural, rich and poor) but has taken more nationalistic tones. A traditional populism but with a darker-nationalstic tone. What a time :S
2930 2018-11-29 19:15:29 Don’t think so. It is more about the difficulty that each month without a pickup in core brings for the ECB’s narrative on rates normalisation in an environment of falling headline inflation in H1 via lower oil prices.
2931 2018-11-29 19:15:18 Markets were mostly contained, looking ahead to the weekend’s G20 meeting between Trump and Xi. Oil bounced 2% after Russia reportedly signalled production cuts. The FOMC minutes signalled a December rate hike is likely.
2932 2018-11-29 19:15:15 It will get me all the way. 

Here’s the thing, I get it, you like oil. Chances are you pay your bills using oil money. I understand that, however, it’s done. It’s over. Oil is fucking up the planet. You can say PIPELINE PIPELINE all you guys want, but it’s over.

2937 2018-11-29 19:14:48 What we need to do is somehow link getting our oil to market to infringing on French language rights. That seems to be the only thing that gets the attention of all of our national leaders these days.

2953 2018-11-29 19:13:00 Because his sanctions from 60-80 went up to  600-800, which prevented the progress and gas prices we could have had. The growth was done on a state level and not by anything he did, says Shell Oil.

2962 2018-11-29 19:12:30 $USD isn't doing so bad considering: almost everyone in the FOMC have spoken dovish in last 2 weeks/somewhat bad economic data/some positive trade war news/oil plunge. I mean no other curreny+gold has managed to break out vs USD so far although some are very close now(antipodes).

A message to all Arab countries
2967 2018-11-29 19:12:15 21 Trillion deficit is rich in your eyes. Very impressive . In addition the US is selling weapons to Saudi Arabia worth 14 billion USD and by doing this pouring even more oil into the fire in the Middle East. Something is really wrong with this president and the US...
2968 2018-11-29 19:12:15 Yay free car wash!

Sadly I live close to a freeway. Oil from cars' exhaust won't let rain get to the car that easily.
2969 2018-11-29 19:12:11 As I’m thinking about it, oil might be problematic as it may stain my clothes. Worth investigating though.
2970 2018-11-29 19:12:02 If you research the Middle Ages, you will find pouring flaming oil on to your enemies as they attack the castle was a common practice. An essential one. I suspect you’ll feel better if you use this oil information for good.
2971 2018-11-29 19:11:46 Good. I'll take a look . Interested in trading oil?!

2974 2018-11-29 19:11:35 Nobody is being conditioned. You either have empathy and a desire for a better world or you don't. Republicans wants big rigs, gas, oil, cigars, guns and limited rights to those who don't adhere to the same ideologies. Being kind and working towards a better tomorrow is not weak.

As such, for USA strategists to watch-out because rest of Euros self-centered,
2983 2018-11-29 19:10:54 people paying way too much for oil and petrol then.
2984 2018-11-29 19:10:42 Ridiculous commentary as we import Saudi oil across Atlantic on massive diesel tankers and watch China expand coal production when our NG available
2985 2018-11-29 19:10:37 Well oiled machine. Except the machine is a powerwheels and the oil is wet sand.
2986 2018-11-29 19:10:21 Good info.

2988 2018-11-29 19:10:17 1. "unwavering support" in the Ukraine
2. Crown Prince Bonesaw will be "held to account"

Cdn action: Keep virtue-signalling & do as little as possible for as long as possible.

Don't spend the NATO min. 2% of GDP on military & keep selling arms to Bonesaw & buying Saudi oil.
2989 2018-11-29 19:10:17 Absolutely. Which oil rig would you like to be assigned to?
2990 2018-11-29 19:10:14 #CBD is safe for pets to use, just make sure to take a look at the ingredients! Only two are needed, hemp extract and a carrier oil.
2991 2018-11-29 19:10:11 Thank you! I have never cooked with mint oil so I appreciate the warning.
2992 2018-11-29 19:10:09 Honestly, cw and tweet because you know the second you decide to do anything else it’s going to be over. So just savour the edible oil product while you can.

2994 2018-11-29 19:10:01 Fear isn't required.  If however you think hitting oil rich desert oligarchs in the pocketbook doesn't annoy and aggravate them, then you're being naïve.
2995 2018-11-29 19:09:59 Tax return, change a tyre, oil change, cpr
2996 2018-11-29 19:09:52 If I offered you $25.00 off CBD oil would you give it a try?  
Yes or No?
I have 12 to giveaway ...
2997 2018-11-29 19:09:39 Oil rises after Russia leans towards output cut: Oil reversed course and rose as much as 3 percent on Thursday, after industry sources said Russia had accepted the need to cut production, together with OPEC ahead of its meeting next week.
2998 2018-11-29 19:09:36 Maduro has SOLD all Venezuelan oil production to China and Russia!
2999 2018-11-29 19:09:36 Yes! I love tea tree oil! Good idea 
3000 2018-11-29 19:09:33 Maybes we could have an actual oil fund if we had managed it ourselves .... but much better to have our neighbour in the big house spend it for us, eh??? 
3001 2018-11-29 19:09:30 This is the longest oil change I’ve ever experienced in my life

3003 2018-11-29 19:09:12 @Toyota @ToyotaMotorCorp bought a used Car from #MurfreesboroToyota they agreed to fix an oil leak then reneged on the deal. As a long time #ToyotaOwner I’m shocked. I guess I’ll be a #FormerToyotaOwner In the future.

3006 2018-11-29 19:09:01 Oil and Gas
3007 2018-11-29 19:09:00 World-wide demand for oil continues to fall, making Putin increasingly desperate to keep his petrostate solvent. 

How to distract the Russian people from their domestic problems? Attack his neighbors in Ukraine again. Works every time!
3008 2018-11-29 19:08:55 Are you saying O&G don't get subsidies? Because the reality is we lead the G7 in oil subsidies.
3009 2018-11-29 19:08:52 I have weirdly good cholesterol, doc asked me once if I 'did anything', I was like "Oh yeah. All natural. Butter, peanut oil, heavy cream." She was like "oh, you're one of THOSE." and rolled her eyes - refering to lucky genetics, not organics.
3010 2018-11-29 19:08:47 -For a cute wet eyeshadow look, try eye gloss 

-DIY eye gloss: baby oil & eye shadow  

-Put on lip balm before lipstick/Lip gloss, it will keep ur lips moisturised 
3011 2018-11-29 19:08:42 I say all y’all fight out it but....get a kiddie pool right and fill it full of oil and fight it out like the mature beautiful females y’all are but make sure y’all film it
3012 2018-11-29 19:08:41 Refresh my memory but didn’t this idiot want to make all auto manufacturers go to green energy cars?  Now he’s puffing his chest about oil production milestones he clearly had nothing to do with. Did I miss a memo? 
3013 2018-11-29 19:08:40 Sure, it is a buzzword. But it doesn't mean it has no meaning. Trump's deregulation of everything that values profit over everything else can easily put us back into a bad situation. 2008 was due to greed. Oil companies bad actions are the same. Unchecked greed is bad.
3014 2018-11-29 19:08:36 My 2007 Toyota Corolla my mechanic hates it says he can’t make money on me  Never have spent a nickel in repair other than oil changes and tires and rear shocks once!
3015 2018-11-29 19:08:25 The Chinese just tried an experiment to peg oil to the yuan and it failed miserably.

3017 2018-11-29 19:08:16 Poor Trump, he should have remained a snake oil salesman instead of being president - now the world knows about shroom and taxes

3020 2018-11-29 19:08:08 True but he doesn't actually care about Syria. They're brown, Muslim, don't have oil, and he isn't trying to build a hotel there.
3021 2018-11-29 19:08:02 overrated: arrested development, the rolling stones, the big lebowski, truffle oil

underrated: louisville, sweet potato fries, these new puritans, area rugs
3022 2018-11-29 19:08:02 Driving in the rain in LA sucks, everyone’s tailgating each other, there’s oil on the floor, and people are dressed in colorful rain clothes, it feels like a freaking Mario kart race.
3023 2018-11-29 19:08:00 Get a shampoo with tea tree oil, it tingles lol
3024 2018-11-29 19:07:59 Oil paint
3025 2018-11-29 19:07:48 Happened in spite of him, anyone paying attention knows this.  KXL pipeline was the tip of the iceberg, he allowed oil export only if Congress increased renewable subsidies for his green constituents.  He's lying and he knows it.
3026 2018-11-29 19:07:48 We now have CBD oil at Warren's. Ask us about it!
3027 2018-11-29 19:07:42 Coconut oil and cocoa butter 
3028 2018-11-29 19:07:35 An idiot talking Russia using our oil revenue and our soldiers in the proxy war in Syria also turkey is a friend as we supply their oil which cost less if they buy it from others and turkey is in Nato as well
3029 2018-11-29 19:07:29 That isn't talking Scotland down its called being realistic about oil revenues and tax income.
3030 2018-11-29 19:07:26 You're buying something fried in oil. Obviously the more things fried in that oil before your thing, the more complex and wondrous the flavor.

Just eat fried things less often and/or die younger and happier.
3031 2018-11-29 19:07:20 You’re very fortunate to be in such a bind. Trust me
3032 2018-11-29 19:07:17 Buying oil off the hard bounce! If the entry isn't right, the dividend ain't bad. $RDS.A $BP $CVX $XOM $OXY $PXD All depends on the #OPECcut
3033 2018-11-29 19:07:17 I don't assume everyone is a shill. I had a very productive meeting with a bunch of Blockchain people today. The quota of snake oil salesmen (gendering intentional) is just extremely bad today (a hype cycle thing).
3034 2018-11-29 19:07:17 the quran SAYS to lie, fake identity, enter infidel land and impose sharia. thats what they do and are doing. BRITISH and turkish empire let them follow us to our Holy Land to "repeat Mecca and Medina" bc those white plunderers, like the Roman, Philistine Plunderers, wanted oil
3035 2018-11-29 19:07:06 You guys have to be much stronger on the pipeline issue.Butts-Trudeau are getting away with killing oil and gas.
3036 2018-11-29 19:07:00 It's a leaky tube of Canadian Sludge junk oil sent for export. It's only value to the U.S. is as a liability. Can you read? Can you process fact? You're an idiot!
3037 2018-11-29 19:06:59 My super nail secrets are keeping a glass nail file handy to smooth out any rough edges, only file in one direction, and if youre not going to paint them on the regular then keep a clear coat on them to help keep moisture out
Also nail/cuticle oil, so much oil
3038 2018-11-29 19:06:54 That was hilarious watching @Obama twist himself into a pretzel trying to take credit for private oil wells and @realDonaldTrump economics.
3039 2018-11-29 19:06:51 No anxiety from smells. But I do get enraged when people wear patchouli oil. ANY of that stuff is too much.
3040 2018-11-29 19:06:32 So she is revoking the sale of the military equipment and ending all oil shipments?
3041 2018-11-29 19:06:24 Ladies, if he:

- Is taking your money at every turn
- Thinks about himself more than you
- Uses your dollars to fund oil drilling and pipelines

He’s not your man. 
He’s a Big Bank.
3042 2018-11-29 19:06:20 , no words can express my disgust with her, him and the people who vote for this snake oil.
3043 2018-11-29 19:06:19 @SVakhshouri is it any chance for iran oil endorsement?
3044 2018-11-29 19:06:13 almost pissed myself during these debates, one woman is arguing against marijuana & called cannabis oil “cannibal oil” & then continued to say that narcotics are the healthier alternative
3045 2018-11-29 19:06:09 This subject should be devoid of political persuasion.... it is so BLOOMING OBVIOUS that we need to get moving on Pipelines as a safe mode of oil transport.  All parties (Fed's and Provincial) should be totally united in this aim....  and I think are except for PMJT's team
3046 2018-11-29 19:06:04 We do not import petrol. We import crude oil.
3047 2018-11-29 19:06:02 Idiom of the day: burning the midnight oil means to stay up late, working or studying. For example: During the last week of the semester, she knew she would be burning the midnight oil every night in order to get all her assignments in on time.
3048 2018-11-29 19:05:58 dudes dont know how to fight, change oil, or nothin. y’all  just do drugs & cry.
3049 2018-11-29 19:05:55 @Elemis hello - I recently bought the peptide nighttime recovery cream oil but it’s given me awful acne  can I take it back to one of your counters if I don’t have a receipt? X

3051 2018-11-29 19:05:52 In past few years I've switched from #EarlGrey tea to Constant Comment. Recently, I had a few cups of EG & the middle finger of my left hand is twitching madly, something it hasn't done for a while. Sadly, I think I need to be completely Bergamot-oil-free.

3056 2018-11-29 19:04:54 Since it almost never rains, the oil on the roads never gets washed away. When it does rain, the roads are extra slick from all that saved up oil.
3057 2018-11-29 19:04:49 @RSPOtweets And the palm oil industry mafia fox (Rountable on Sustainable Palm Oil) watches the (rainforest) henhouse.

3060 2018-11-29 19:04:37 The real price we are getting for Albertans’ oil is at its lowest point in  history Today the market price for most of our oil – Western Canada  Select – is $12 (USD) per barrel. We’re getting about ten cents for a  litre of Alberta oil.

3064 2018-11-29 19:04:32 Jus imagine this if Nigeria discovered oil in 1960 and they still can't turn it around coz of poor governance. Same with us with our plethora of minerals but dololo good governance and policies. This is it maybe eyiiiiiii  #plazinithings
3065 2018-11-29 19:04:27 I am so using this next time my check oil... erm...  I mean 'tea pot' light comes on.
3066 2018-11-29 19:04:26 Literally all I want is an oil change. I know my car has 16 other issues and NO I’m not letting you fix them. So why my total come up to $60 
3067 2018-11-29 19:04:19 Heard him say this and could not believe what was coming out of his mouth. Democratic regulations many of which he penned were strangling the energy companies. There was a lot of Fracking going on but as the oil company prez said it was my Obama driving it.

3071 2018-11-29 19:04:00 @jimcramer It's true that gas and in some places oil is bottled up and would like to get to higher priced markets (I like Rusty Braziel). Also consider US strategy to keep our long-term tank full of low cost high intensity fuels (e.g., fossil). #longhaul

3077 2018-11-29 19:03:36 Ah, another country that doesn't have free healthcare. Imagine we charged everyone to go to the doctors, and saved up all the money we currently spend and put it in a big pot. How much do you think it would be? We could call it an "oil fund" or something.

Plastics are derived from materials found in nature, such as natural gas, oil, coal, minerals and plants. The very first plastics were made by nature—did you know that rubber from a rubber tree is actually a plastic?
3080 2018-11-29 19:03:06 I made a scalp scrub with some pink Himalayan salt, tea tree oil, and grape seed oil & I’m feeling like a alchemist because nothing was ever the same after that.
3081 2018-11-29 19:02:57 What are you, an oil man at @bronzeagemantis 's gym?
3082 2018-11-29 19:02:57 n the most interesting part is today oil was trade less then US$50 in international market ....around 30% reduction till now
3083 2018-11-29 19:02:55 Don’t just trust the cancer industry and their less than gaudy 3% cure rate - use adjunct therapies like cannabis oil and the ketogenic diet to better your chances. Good luck!

3092 2018-11-29 19:02:00 Based on the comments, it seems that some citizens haven’t caught onto what Paulson, Schultz and Baker are telling us - returning dividends has nothing to do with taxes. The comparison is akin to saying that the oil dividend checks that Alaskans get every year is a tax.

وشكرا لحسن تجاوبكم
3101 2018-11-29 19:01:19 Oily skin, I’m taking medication rn and that’s helped a lot but I’m still breaking out (I’m starting accutane next week I want to die). I use an oil cleanser, clean & clear cleanser, witch hazel toner, jojoba oil (which I believe has helped my acne & scarring), hyaluronic acid
3102 2018-11-29 19:01:10 u ever impulsively buy an essential oil diffuser set just to flex on your poor respiratory health and sleep patterns?
3103 2018-11-29 19:01:09 That's an oil lamp. If you rub it the engine genie will grant you three wishes.
3104 2018-11-29 19:01:04 We need to make whole foods accountable for an unhealthy hot foods bar. Almost every hot food contains genetically modified canola oil, courtesy of Monsanto. Canola oil causes heart disease. Who is with me on this?
3105 2018-11-29 19:01:04 Great. Now stop buying their oil. Mmkay?  We have our own oil but we are paying them for oil.

It’s absurd
3106 2018-11-29 19:00:56 doughnuts are my most enduring memory of chanukkah!! any food that can be fried in oil is a mitzvah
3107 2018-11-29 19:00:55 I dont mind rubbing your back with oil.

3114 2018-11-29 19:00:13 I once was told oil was basically unlimited. If that’s the case God what a huge lie
3115 2018-11-29 19:00:09 Coconut oil works if you put it on after you shower, kinda like a body wash. However, it makes a mess in the tub & could potentially be dangerous as it makes the shower very slippery (spoken from experience)!

3117 2018-11-29 18:59:58 so I mix a little organic coconut oil with coconut water rub in my vagina then wipe with a Pacifica wipe before or after sex, I also like her Pacifica alcohol free sprays, you can totally spray your cat with these, they won't flame you down there lol
3118 2018-11-29 18:59:52 I got you, Jonathan. So it's sumalak, sprouted wheat and oil dish that's cooked for a day. It's a traditional Navrus dish of which I am not a big fan of.
3119 2018-11-29 18:59:47 And the 80.000 barrels of Saudi oil per day?
3120 2018-11-29 18:59:42 I went from doing nothing all day to climbing under a machine covered in oil
3121 2018-11-29 18:59:39 Oil plus fire is usually not a good thing
3122 2018-11-29 18:59:39 In case anyone is wondering...  Amazon sells CBD oil.
Where is the damned postman when you need him.

3123 2018-11-29 18:59:25 ^ this. Castor oil is really good for us black folk
3124 2018-11-29 18:59:17 @MichelleObama He drove this Country to the ground, impede the growth of oil and gas, in fact stopped the construction of the oil line from Canada, now he wants the credit for a booming economy..what a disgrace and yes he is your husband!
3125 2018-11-29 18:59:04 The Aldi one is Nutoka which has certified sustainable palm oil.
3126 2018-11-29 18:59:02 Oil based or water based? 
3127 2018-11-29 18:59:01 Neem oil is literally a miracle I haven’t had a breakout since I started using it
3128 2018-11-29 18:59:00 I'm having a hard time understanding what you mean. I don't know what an EBT card is I assume you're American you're talking to Canadians here you don't pay shit for us. But you need our oil or water are trees so don't attack Canadians it'll get bad for you
3129 2018-11-29 18:58:55 You need to take a break from this nonsense and hit Lucas Oil
3130 2018-11-29 18:58:55 Took my car to the mini dealer for leaking coolant and oil. Bill-$3000
Next day engine light on and all coolant gone. Took back to mini and now its the themostat leaking and they want to charge me again. This car is a 100% lemon and i have had enough. Do not buy Mini @MINI
3131 2018-11-29 18:58:52 If those things were to happen I agree they would be bad. A weakened Russia due to low oil prices, sanctions, and a certainty that America has the military force to deal with them is also a great deterrent. It is undeniable that we have that.
3132 2018-11-29 18:58:52 I do also but what difference does it make?  We don’t demand China remove Xi, or Russia Putin for their murders & human rights abuses?  Trump is no doubt furious at this incompetence & stupidity & will deal w it but the security of the Mid-East, Israel, oil prices, are at risk.
3133 2018-11-29 18:58:38 just had some thc oil lord help me
3134 2018-11-29 18:58:36 Because apparently, you’re still a “kid” until you’re 26.
3135 2018-11-29 18:58:35 This isn't very well written for a churnalist.  In your tweet, if you swap the words  #UK  and #EU around, then you are spot on.  The UK is finished, you are £2 trillion in debt and Scotland is leaving with the oil.  Goodbye and good luck. #Brexit #indyref2 #FMQs #TheresaMay
3136 2018-11-29 18:58:24 Based on the comments, it seems that some citizens haven’t caught onto what Paulson, Schultz and Baker are telling us - returning dividends has nothing to do with taxes. The comparison is akin to saying that the oil dividend checks that Alaskans get every year is a tax.
3137 2018-11-29 18:58:24 Lol my guy ne ai
3138 2018-11-29 18:58:19 Followed!
3139 2018-11-29 18:58:19 No be lie you talk abeg. Next time add anointing oil.
3140 2018-11-29 18:58:18 $CrudeOil closing with full gain almost at yesterday's high credit to Kuwait Oil Minster earlier today also boosting the almost dead $CAD. Tomorrow holds for more with plenty of fundamentals to close the month... trade safely...
3141 2018-11-29 18:58:02 Any chance Oil put a claim in on Zykov?
3142 2018-11-29 18:57:56 I work in the oil field for 15 years as a survey assistant but those skills don't transfer over into other jobs apparently .I went and got my class 1but nowhere will hire you if you have less than 2 3 years experience
3143 2018-11-29 18:57:53 Retweeted All!
3144 2018-11-29 18:57:49 We all know thats motor oil  we all know that’s motor oil  We all know thats motor oil  We all know thats motor oil  We all know thats motor oil  We all know thats motor oil  We all know thats motor oil  We all know thats motor oil  we all know thats motor oil 
3145 2018-11-29 18:57:45 I use a witch hazel/rose oil/ grapefruit spray that I got from Walmart and its fragrance free/all natural but I don’t think it will moisturize lol
3146 2018-11-29 18:57:36 That’s my fav oil for the season!!!
3147 2018-11-29 18:57:34 KSA gets to keep their oil in the ground/storage until prices rise. They win in the long run. USA are the losers that keep producing unprofitable oil in shale.
3148 2018-11-29 18:57:22 まじすか？
そんなの来たことないです
3149 2018-11-29 18:57:15 You’re emissions have gone up regularly & BC & the federal government have given tax exemptions to highest polluters & you sell coal to China to burn, the pipeline that was supposed to carry oil now carry LNG. Meanwhile AB is in crisis & the hypocrisy is overwhelming
3150 2018-11-29 18:57:11 Pancakes with motor oil 
3151 2018-11-29 18:57:09 On ne va pas se battre sur les chiffres mais, 27% c’est une moyenne incluant bien d’autres éléments que le seul transport. Le vélo n’est qu’une partie de la solution globale.
3152 2018-11-29 18:57:09 Not sure if I’ll make chip oil. Setting off at half 4 
3153 2018-11-29 18:57:06 We once had a tenant who liked olive oil candles.  After 6 months, the amount of oily soot that needed to be cleaned off everything, including the roof beams, was incredible.
3154 2018-11-29 18:57:03 Get some garlic oil from sprouts, 2 times a day for like 5-10 minutes. Works wonders for me!
3155 2018-11-29 18:56:57 Maddie banned Nutella from our house as it has palm oil in it...#nomorenutella . Good girl Maddie
3156 2018-11-29 18:56:50 I made this love oil and I really can’t wait to use it omgggjf
3157 2018-11-29 18:56:49 oil not found
3158 2018-11-29 18:56:42 aye buddy my mom pronounces Olive oil as “Olay oyo”

3165 2018-11-29 18:55:45 Tens unit, an Alexa (I love these), oil diffuser (I love mine, early gift), I like notebooks (love notebooks), hoodies but thats just me.
3166 2018-11-29 18:55:40 I just asked. There might be flavours,oil other ingredients. I actually take care
3167 2018-11-29 18:55:37 To the Oil&Gas Grifters: We have faith in the AG.
3168 2018-11-29 18:55:35 Anyone ask Rex Tillerson for a comment?

3170 2018-11-29 18:55:13 Who the heck uses motor oil for making pancakes?
3171 2018-11-29 18:55:12 Madame Michettí le habló en "langue d'oíl" un francés provenzal del siglo X que dio origen al occitano y a todas las lenguas galas. Asi de cultos somos, si Macron es un ignorante que no entendía no es culpa de Gabrielle.
3172 2018-11-29 18:55:05 The president  of Shell Oil said @BarackObama was a liar when he recently  claimed  credit for oil boom

3175 2018-11-29 18:54:54 Agreed. Spot on about oil prices in international markets 
3176 2018-11-29 18:54:54 I think your tinfoil hat needs some more oil, it's squeaker than usual today
3177 2018-11-29 18:54:53 Haha, the Tories hate anything that allows genuine people to express themselves. I'd boil the lot of them in oil. Cockroaches, all of them.

3180 2018-11-29 18:54:17 You seem to have stirred up a hornets' nest on Twitter by this campaign. Lots of people unhappy with your approach to palm oil, and your tax avoidance. I am glad that people's attention is being drawn to these issues, so that maybe you'll realise it's bad business to get it wrong
3181 2018-11-29 18:54:13 @FirestoneTires how the hell do you bring in a car with no oil leaks for an oil change , only to have it leaking when they are done. Only to have the service department f*** you backwards
3182 2018-11-29 18:54:12 Evil crony capitalist corporations: 
Outsource to countries that treat/pay workers like slaves. 
Pay millions for attorneys to take advantage of tax loopholes.
Use coal and oil vs. renewable energy. 

Overlooked hiring only women, saving 51 cents on the dollar on labor. 
Right?
3183 2018-11-29 18:54:09 It's like funding "green jobs" thinking you're going to compete with cheap oil.
3184 2018-11-29 18:54:05 Ban on Saudi Oil imports?????????????????
3185 2018-11-29 18:53:53 I need some oil go get me some I know you right there next to the rig, you can take off your neighbor truck off your header now
3186 2018-11-29 18:53:50 That spray crap makes me lethargic...I like the essential oil sprays better... plus I hate half the snot nosed stuck up bitches I work with so I don’t mind blowing up the bathroom and letting them walk into my wall of fecal love. 
3187 2018-11-29 18:53:46 Hi Jim, you traded oil, but what symbol? Thank you.
3188 2018-11-29 18:53:42 LOL what you're saying is that an oil executive says there would have been more production if there had been less regulation. Who gives a shit what he says? The goal is balance of production and responsible environmental conduct, not making rich people richer.
3189 2018-11-29 18:53:42 Do Canadians realize hw much pollution is coming from foreign oil they have leaks every where plus the money we would be making from our own oil would give us more money for Canadians not Middle East countries
3190 2018-11-29 18:53:40 But yeah, tobacco and cannabis essential oil plus terpenes often found in strains that are supposed to enhance creativity. Dispensaries publishing the exact terpenic content of their strains on their websites made that part a breeze.
3191 2018-11-29 18:53:36 A splash of chili oil along with 2 whole eggs is the best thing I've ever done to ramen. Life changing.
3192 2018-11-29 18:53:28 GREAT NEWS FOR RADIENT TECHNOLOGIES IN EDMONTON ALBERTA CANADA.....HOME OF THE NEW OIL BOOM!
3193 2018-11-29 18:53:27 U didn't buy oil
3194 2018-11-29 18:53:21 You're doing this for political gain by attempting to swing the AB oil heads to your camp. I thought you were going to great things for AB but here you are following the useless PC and pushing Oil only. Pathetic.
3195 2018-11-29 18:53:07 During th last oil boom in ND, I turned in a suspected sex-for-hire ring operating in a local upscale hotel. Th Bismarck PD said, "I don't think Bismarck has a prostitution law. Call the City Atty." I did; same answer. A week or so later, Bismarck enacted a prostitution ordinance

3197 2018-11-29 18:53:01 Thank goodness that the US is now a net oil exporter and won't need to rely on Arab oil so much anymore.
3198 2018-11-29 18:52:59 Obama fought the use and production of oil and gas at every turn. His chutzpah is astonishing.
3199 2018-11-29 18:52:58 Great idea of not using airplanes anymore because of its emissions, but if you live on a small island  like Jamaica it would feel like house-arrest. How about getting those mega oil tankers to reduce shipments if we all used less petro-products.
3200 2018-11-29 18:52:47 The US CIA, CAUSED the Venezuelan problem with their idea of 'regime change,' which they do often when an oil producing country doesn't go along with their ideas of American control, which is why they had Hugo Chavez ousted.
3201 2018-11-29 18:52:37 I'm no mechanic, but it seems this well oiled machine is starting to spit a little oil... !!
3202 2018-11-29 18:52:26 I offered a co worker my oil based butter(diary free, tastes just like butter). He was like vegan butter  nah I’m good. Eat that bagel dry af then, now I’m never talking to him again lol

3204 2018-11-29 18:52:07 Thank you for reporting this. Scotland is consistently ignored by Westminster especially by the conservatives who have nothing but disdain for us.  They only want the money from our oil revenues and whisky industry.
3205 2018-11-29 18:51:52 Fwiw, I use oil not pills.

It is good to have you back

3210 2018-11-29 18:51:30 Damn Obama’s out reaching for people to thank him for trumps successs in economics/oil/ etc lol tries getting every inch of greatness to disregard all his shit moves. He made history being the first black president, great, but he’s lied and deceived his legacy to the people.
3211 2018-11-29 18:51:29 Didn’t he threaten to put oil companies out of biz, vetoed the pipeline & outlawed fracking
3212 2018-11-29 18:51:20 So we have a website, a radio channel, a tv channel, a life as it is taria streaming channel and now a blog. What i need now is lavaland haircare products, lavaland oil, a lavaland dreams for dummies book, a lavalanddreams cook book and... I NEED MOAR
3213 2018-11-29 18:51:20 leftist   @sunny   blows  gasket;    "I don't care what Obama did"  Please  tell that to  the  POS   who is  pathetically claiming credit for  US  oil production #1.

3216 2018-11-29 18:51:11 Let’s just say this.  The oil and gas industry is the second largest government funder... it isn’t gonna go away.  Right up there is tobacco.  As long as these industries are funding they will be backed.  As much as Obama tried to destroy it... he couldn’t eliminate it.
3217 2018-11-29 18:51:04 Long story short, big piles of oil money looking for something to do.
3218 2018-11-29 18:50:58 I hecka applaud you for successfully training your hair  I hate being an oily mess. Does the oil production dramatically decrease after washing less frequently?

3222 2018-11-29 18:50:32 What helped me was getting a hot towel as hot as I can take. Like really hot. And sit it on my face for a minute or two. Then rub in Jamaican Black Castor oil when its barely damp.

3228 2018-11-29 18:50:12 No. 
Because Dopey will fear loosing Eastern Canada votes if he did the right thing. Oil would have to be sourced elsewhere at a higher price.
He is using current low oil prices to impose his #CarbonTax, blinding the consumer. Just wait until WTI hits $100 again!
3229 2018-11-29 18:50:12 @BBCBreaking FOOD ALLERGIES. Please note that chip shops fry their scampi and other sea food in SAME oil as fish so people with seafood allergies are at risk! I know this as I am allergic to seafood and cannot buy fish from chip shops.

3231 2018-11-29 18:49:57 You had nothing to do with the prices of oil going lower. There is a glut in the market. I would love to see you take an oil bath like the birds have!
3232 2018-11-29 18:49:55 And which edible oil lobby is taking care of this scamster?
3233 2018-11-29 18:49:48 Very easy. They're like a small convection oven (there's no real "frying"). I like to coat the food with a little oil, garlic powder & pepper flakes for kick, then put it in the air fryer basket, set time & temp and that's it.
3234 2018-11-29 18:49:48 Coconut MCT 60/40 oil: CDN $13.35/kg, FCL = 80 drums x 190kg per drum.

3237 2018-11-29 18:49:37 Yeah I use natural ingredients too I do coffee and brown sugar but I basically have this oil based cleanser that I leave on while I exfoliate with the coffee and sugar. I’ve been doing it twice a week and it’s soooo helpful
3238 2018-11-29 18:49:32 Tupperware is an oil based product and we’re trying to transition away from that.
3239 2018-11-29 18:49:32 $USO is back above 11.00. This could be the start of an oil bull run over the next few months.
3240 2018-11-29 18:49:29 Ya girl just copped free Chick-fil-A, got gas  for $2.02 and a $20 oil change. Today is my day  #thanfulthursday
3241 2018-11-29 18:49:28 My adult children still ask me to make this simple recipe
1 cup flour
1 cup milk
1 egg
1/3 cup vegetable oil
1 Tbsp baking powder

Then add the fun stuff - chocolate chips, cheese, cooked bacon...
3242 2018-11-29 18:49:24 Literally the best news I’ve heard all week - I’m not allowed to do anything or have anything stress my body out.  I can deal with that, chuck us a candle and some lavender oil Hun.
3243 2018-11-29 18:49:23 Obama thought they were talking about cannabis oil.
3244 2018-11-29 18:49:20 Came in for an oil change and tire rotation, 3 hours later, still not done. This is fine
3245 2018-11-29 18:49:11 The always under rated Squirrel Oil.... lol

3247 2018-11-29 18:49:03 @Ocasio2018 don't let the crooks bought by big oil take away from your green plan! represent queens! we want to live!
3248 2018-11-29 18:49:01 Dont put tariffs on china. Indias value against dollar falls apart. Oil becomes expensive. And every product becomes expensive.
3249 2018-11-29 18:48:51 There's a Paris, Texas. Maybe there's a Seattle in Somalia 
3250 2018-11-29 18:48:48 The US is full of smoke and mirrors..... As usual it's oil related....

3252 2018-11-29 18:48:39 Waiting to get oil changed @jiffylube for > 1 hour.  Should just be called “you’ll get your damn car back when we’re done with it - lube”
3253 2018-11-29 18:48:38 Not to beat a dead horse or dinosaur in this case but @BarackObama has gleefully declared himself King of Fossil Fuels laying claim “that was me” who was responsible for the unprecedented surge in oil production. Heads have to be spinning!
3254 2018-11-29 18:48:34 Well I will give him credit for cash for clunkers. But on the oil thing nope he did nothing. His ideas were all socialist progressive concepts. We could have ended up like Venezuela 2.0 .Thank God For President Trump and VP Mike Pence their vision has brought us a brighter future
3255 2018-11-29 18:48:31 Love seeing these two queens butt heads...makes sense as their rivalry is still alive & well...after all ...they are like oil & water...with a hell of a lot of bad blood between them...Taylor vs Brooke...Bring it! @TheHunterTylo @KatherineKellyL #BoldandtheBeautiful

3258 2018-11-29 18:48:16 High coverage and great for oil control but it tends to cling to dry patches and get cakey if you use too much. Definitely a heavier foundation (you can feel it on your skin) but if that doesn't bother you then I'd say go for it!!

3261 2018-11-29 18:47:52 Two small medical marijuana gummies cured my PTSD and I use CBD oil every day for joint pain and it eliminates it with no "high" effects. If you object to marijuana then there should be no alcohol or prescribed opiates.
3262 2018-11-29 18:47:37 Hummmm conquer everything
3263 2018-11-29 18:47:25 I want to play auto mechanic with somebody’s daughter. You know, dip in and check for oil and stuff... Put my nozzle in and fill her up UP!!!  >_>
3264 2018-11-29 18:47:24 Saudi is buying weapons from the US. It’s giving them money and oil, profit. Zimbabwe kill its own people after begging for the weapons. They beg food from the US then sell or politicise it. Permanently oppose US foreign policy. It’s all liability towards the US. the difference
3265 2018-11-29 18:47:17 The key to perfect fried eggs: low heat and lots of butter! Also, a pro tip is to oil the spatula before flipping to ensure the spatula slides easily under the eggs.

3268 2018-11-29 18:46:49 The only reason guys have patchy beards is cause they want it to grow so it can fill in. Using Jamaican black castor oil as hot oil treatment will help too but they don't be knowing that
3269 2018-11-29 18:46:49 I just said oil money can buy players and trophies but it can't buy atmosphere.  Perhaps you should read, or better yet learn to read before responding
3270 2018-11-29 18:46:42 I'm politically homeless, Dwight. I don't support an antisemitic, pro brexit, corbyn Labour party. I support humanity, common sense and standing up to the bullies, the snake oil salesemen and narrow minded little hitlers. I oppose the far right, i oppose the swindlers! Don't you?

3272 2018-11-29 18:46:35 NJ is known for many things: Springsteen, boardwalks and the Sopranos. But it may also be know as the crude oil export hub on the U.S. East Coast. @Devikakrishnak reporting Buckeye moving Bakken barrels out of Perth Amboy terminal as it ramps ups more crude volumes next year.

3280 2018-11-29 18:46:04 As far as I can tell the main effect of CBD oil is that it makes me zone out when someone tries to explain it to me.
3281 2018-11-29 18:46:00 Lol no links I mean it’s stuff online about the benefits but just get some from the supermarket and start using it... should be near the olive oil
3282 2018-11-29 18:45:49 I’m not forcing anything on you but today life in 2018 is what make it that we need oil for now to move around, cause I’m sure you don’t leave as your ancestor anymore even if you can is it possible for you to do it and give up everything. I challenge you.
3283 2018-11-29 18:45:49 I'll find out how many to get a custom scent. I bet it has to exist as an oil or perfume or something. One zillion stickers, please!

3286 2018-11-29 18:45:36 And the CEO of BP, during the Gulf oil crisis spill, told him to 'take a hike' and butt out, so he did.
3287 2018-11-29 18:45:20 Ever since the gas shortage back in the 70’s, which created those some times deadly long lines of cars, the banter has always been to get away from oil dependence. Well now 46 years later it looks like NFW it will ever happen .
3288 2018-11-29 18:45:12 Now as an adult when I sit somewhere, my coconut oil gives the same vibe  but guess who is thirty and doesn’t give a damn anymore?!?! This girl.
3289 2018-11-29 18:44:45 Also If you have a long commute- I just got an electric vehicle(leaf) and it was life changing. Access to carpool lane, rebates through 2019 and good mileage - and the e-pedal is actually awesome- it’s saving my knee from the constant braking in the stop and go. I work in oil btw
3290 2018-11-29 18:44:45 It's a toss up between the motor oil and the fucking toothpicks in the burgers that pissed me off the most  Also... Dear America, crepes are the superior style of pancake and Nutella is the superior topping get with the fucking program!!!

3298 2018-11-29 18:44:00 How can he even think he had anything to do with it when he fought for 8 friggin years to stop oil production. He's beginning to believe his own lies!!
3299 2018-11-29 18:43:49 If the world are genuinely concerned about Africa the picture of that poor boy drinking contaminated water in the Niger-Delta region of Nigeria should be at the front cover of any news paper & magazines. Britain & Dutch harness oil in the region & neglect the well being of ppl
3300 2018-11-29 18:43:48 Why doesn’t Ardern release the review details on sexual abuse of minors at Labour Camp? Why did Kirton and Howarth remain in their jobs?

3302 2018-11-29 18:43:35 Yeah I think it's related to mint. I'm thinking of the olbas oil type smell if you've ever come across it.
3303 2018-11-29 18:43:31 So what is your solution Kenny sit back and do nothing?Give Rachel credit she is pushing for a pipeline more than I seen any conservative do meanwhile she is acting to get oil moving as fast as she can until and if the pipeline happens.
3304 2018-11-29 18:43:27 Yeah except getting things fixed around the house, paying all the bills, feeding you most of the week, keeping that lovely car you like to joy ride fixed with oil changes, or whatever else you ask for I’m good for nothing
3305 2018-11-29 18:43:24 You never did a single thing to help the oil & gas industry
3306 2018-11-29 18:43:24 Wrap your head around this:

In 24 hours we’ve gone from Manafort secretly met w/ Assange, Jerome Corsi and Roger Stone were in cahoots w/ Assange, Michael Cohen lied about a Trump Tower plan in Moscow to a Trump/Russian oil deal.

But Trump is crazy for calling it a Witch Hunt?
3307 2018-11-29 18:43:13 Why are the Liberal Government funding Tides Canada to campaign against Alberta oil and gas? @LefebvrePaul @JustinTrudeau
3308 2018-11-29 18:43:08 We'll keep trying till we become the standby men
3309 2018-11-29 18:43:07 The Washington Department of Ecology says it has fined Coleman Oil of Lewiston $189,000 for spilling 3,840 gallons of biodiesel from an underground pipe at its Wenatchee plant. The agency says company has been cooperative and has worked with the state on the cleanup.
3310 2018-11-29 18:43:04 So mean
3311 2018-11-29 18:43:01 Does anyone use CBD oil for anxiety and can you educate me on vapes/oils plz
3312 2018-11-29 18:42:59 We big adults now, we getting an oil change today.

3314 2018-11-29 18:42:56 Oil recovered from earlier losses to move above $50 a barrel Thursday, after reports that Russian officials are signaling the likelihood of a production cut in tandem with Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries...
3315 2018-11-29 18:42:49 Was this incl.$25 M handed by @JulieBishopMP ?Ironically Australia REJECTED to fund a study of only $3,5 M on 2009 Timor Sea Oil Spill Disaster that has ruined the life of more than 100.000 poor coastal community in West Timor up to now. @ScottMorrisonMP @jokowi @PresidentTrump_
3316 2018-11-29 18:42:47 Don't get hung up on stuff like this, Matt.  We need pipelines to get Alberta oil to markets to lift the price they get.  Ford Nation claim of low gas prices is complete crap.  Pipelines = cheap gas and better $ for oil
3317 2018-11-29 18:42:42 If that's the case, why are many Canadian oil companies voluntarily cutting production?  And even if they were making money, Alberta isn't. It's our resource and the less we sell it for the less we get.
3318 2018-11-29 18:42:38 When AB suffered job-loss fallout from mid-2014 decline in oil prices, Mr. Harper did what? In 2016 and newly elected, the Liberals gave extended EI and other benefits to AB and other regions *retroactive* to January/15 when Mr. Harper was still in power. #cdnpoli #abpoli

3320 2018-11-29 18:42:33 The broken down train has long gone however it left behind a lot of oil on the rail so it requires cleaning before opening. ^DA
3321 2018-11-29 18:42:22 That's because it will die in the Senate! Obama tried this crap and it was abysmal!  Now Obama is asking people to thank him for the high oil production and low oil prices!  You Democrats are hypocrites!  Do you drive an electric car Ocasio?
3322 2018-11-29 18:42:20 It’s my lazy vegetable fasho. If i got time, it’ll be green beans or roasted sweet potatoes with some olive oil, cinnamon, allspice & cayenne pepper
3323 2018-11-29 18:42:07 Castor oil and aloe Vera will do wonders, if your hair/scalp is dry and damaged. They cost $5 all together. No need to buy expensive hair products!!!
3324 2018-11-29 18:41:54 Our local feed supply has CBD oil for dogs and cats. I wonder if that might be beneficial for him.

3332 2018-11-29 18:41:08 As an American, I don’t want to be the leader in oil production. I want us to lead into the future and its energy resources. Oil, coal: they should be the equivalent of the steam engine and the horse and cart. Let’s be brave and bold and innovative!
3333 2018-11-29 18:41:01 I’m a big fan of coconut oil on skin. It’s poison in my hair. Anyway...

3340 2018-11-29 18:40:30 Heya @Porsche, if for SOME reason you see this, what would basic repairs and such (ie an oil change or something) on a 2008 Cayenne cost about. I really like the car, and if I wanna buy used I do wanna know what I'm getting into in that regard, thanks!
3341 2018-11-29 18:40:28 I just saw an oil tanker blow ass over teakettle beneath the GG Bridge like a gum wrapper. Is that windy enough?
3342 2018-11-29 18:40:28 Shouldn't  sanctioning of there oil imports by 50-100% been the first logical step. I mean everyone needs oil, to move goods, heat home, travel. Oil is needed by everyone. 
Problem is Trudeau and Butts just don't want it to be Canadian oil.
3343 2018-11-29 18:40:27 Florida can really go now.

3346 2018-11-29 18:40:06 Except the part where they have light oil, and we have the stuff used for asphalt.     But, go ahead, just volunteer your area for the needed special refineries for Dilbit/WCS. I’m sure the cancer rates won’t jump that high.

3354 2018-11-29 18:39:31 Most oil sands operations have changed quite a bit. The new ones are not as damaging as the old by a long shot. SAGD changed so much.
3355 2018-11-29 18:39:22 And again the concerns about oil harming other species has been legit. No perfect solution, of course. But they’ve got to get those numbers down. Fishing’s been wiped out.

3360 2018-11-29 18:38:51 Go to Saudi, Russia, Iran, and Venezuela and tell them this if you want to make a difference, not shut down our oil industry produced at the highest environmental and labour standards in the world and putting your fellow countrymen out of work.

3367 2018-11-29 18:38:29 Okay SO.. as much as I want to get on cam today I realized how much I have to get done for December. Like.. a lot. I need to set up the new cam room, get it ready so we can decorate the tree together, edit the oil show recording and upload it, edit and upload the new teaser for
3368 2018-11-29 18:38:25 And for the record, I work at neither GM or the Oil Industry. 

I just don't like Reich Wing Trash
3369 2018-11-29 18:38:23 Yeah, gamification of war and mass murder ! 
Disruption is so badass now, don't miss the next war for freedom oil. 
With dog ears dynamic filters for burning corpses, AR torture in AR Guantanamo, which can be anywhere on earth, because it's in your Hololens !
3370 2018-11-29 18:38:21 Our stove top is uneven so when I make pancakes, the oil in the pan all pools at one side and ends up deep frying the pancakes
3371 2018-11-29 18:38:20 Better yet they broke mid fight against Merged Zamasu, I think Elder Kai is a snake oil salesmen
3372 2018-11-29 18:38:17 The #LWCF is primarily funded through federal offshore oil and gas receipts, but the funds are subject to appropriation. Although $900 million is credited to the fund annually, appropriations since 2011 averaged much lower at $300 million annually.
3373 2018-11-29 18:38:08 For soup, cook minced leek in oil, then simmer with eggs, thyme, beef broth and kale. Top with orzo.
3374 2018-11-29 18:38:05 Oil prices go up. Oil prices go down. It’s been that way for 40 years. When will we learn to take the long view and understand when they go down it isn’t a license to start polluting and buy gas guzzlers (non-hybrid SUVs) and certainly shouldn’t drive policy.
3375 2018-11-29 18:38:04 I hit both of my friends oil pens at the same time for killer cloud action
3376 2018-11-29 18:38:00 Of course he claims credit cause hes an advocate of America always depending on his brothers in the middle east for oil and doesnt want it so obvious.
3377 2018-11-29 18:38:00 I am desperatly googling to prove to myself that people aren't just out here complaining that an oil firm's logo on a big billboard wasn't made a landmark but the only lead I have is venezuelan ownership and it doesn't seem to go far.
3378 2018-11-29 18:37:58 In order to constrain inflation and keep growth,  Trump speaks down oil prices to compensate the effects of Fed's speaking up the interest rates.
3379 2018-11-29 18:37:46 Any SAP OCM candidates out there with strong Oil & Gas experience looking for their next permanent role?   If so I might have just opportunity you are looking for.   Link with me and send your resume.
3380 2018-11-29 18:37:41 We could become a powerhouse of green electrical energy, and just expand the infrastructure already there going into the US.   Likely with just 1 year of Oil/Gas/Coal ‘s tax subsidies changed over to that industry.   Those billions would transform the green industry.
3381 2018-11-29 18:37:34 Those European parts and maintenance cost a grip in the US. Even simple things like oil changes were crazy prices. Nope
3382 2018-11-29 18:37:31 Stop importing their oil? But won’t that drive up our cost of fuel & weaken our economy? But where could we find the oil & help strengthen Canada as a whole?
3383 2018-11-29 18:37:24 I’m late to work....so help me here lmao will putting oil myself be good enough just for today?
3384 2018-11-29 18:37:23 Accidentally swallowed like 2 drops of coconut oil while oil pulling i hope it didnt ruin my fast
3385 2018-11-29 18:37:15 In their defense, the roads there have an enormous amount of oil on them so when it rains it becomes like black ice. I used to laugh too, until I lived there.
3386 2018-11-29 18:37:13 We demand electric car manufacturing in Pakistan by Honda Toyota and Suzuki. This will decrease dependency on oil and release import bill pressure
3387 2018-11-29 18:37:10 A lot, that's only a single grain of salt of things they want to control.
3388 2018-11-29 18:37:00 #CL_F with the continued push over 51.55 MTS #. Target is HOS FTU. See if she can make it in the last hour of pit session. #OOTT #OIL
3389 2018-11-29 18:36:59 @Merit_AB is so full of shit it stinks,run by big business dollars and that dink Kenny (double income no kids) as if he knew anything about what  working families need. When was the PC party any good for Alberta, 44yrs of oil money and not a pot to piss in.UCP ICshit shame on u
3390 2018-11-29 18:36:57 Le habló en francés del siblo X, la "langue d'oíl" que dio origen a todas la lenguas galas. Asi de cultos somos, si los otros son ignorantes no es culpa de madame Michettí.
3391 2018-11-29 18:36:54 Still wondering what Duncan mighty means by if I break your heart na oil spillage
3392 2018-11-29 18:36:52 And made with palm oil!
3393 2018-11-29 18:36:46 So is every other home. Your oil furnace doesn’t run without electricity. That’s why insulation is so important. My house is dropping a degree every four hours and a little dancing  will warm it back up.
3394 2018-11-29 18:36:45 I need to go get my oil changed and go to joanns. Where's my energy?
3395 2018-11-29 18:36:43 We don't always disagree. But Obama won't get credit from me on his oil policy.
3396 2018-11-29 18:36:43 .@michellemungall @GeorgeHeyman Don’t let industry off the hook by implementing weak methane regulations for oil and gas. Inspections based on looking and smelling for an odourless invisible gas just don’t cut it #bcpoli
3397 2018-11-29 18:36:33 Dont think you should be counting this as a true count in production. It's meant to target the 35million barrels of oil in storage. Once that's down 25% it'll be ramped up again. Problem is not production its export path in Canada
3398 2018-11-29 18:36:15 If Legault would seriously endorse the oil and gas insustry...$ATI would be $0.35-$0.50
3399 2018-11-29 18:35:56 He is not promoting oil and gas the same week he is in office. He is smarter than that. It starts in a small way. Like saying he will make Quebec rich again.
3400 2018-11-29 18:35:55 And anointed with engine oil.
3401 2018-11-29 18:35:47 “Jobs of the past just aren’t gonna come back. What are you
going to do?  Wave a magic wand?”  Obama is taking credit for a great
economy that he, HIMSELF, said we would never see again.  Now oil production too. At first it was maddening, then funny, now it’s just pathetic.
3402 2018-11-29 18:35:46 Ooooo girl I just ordered some castor oil on amazon !!!! I’m excited for this weave growth
3403 2018-11-29 18:35:45 Yep, I wind up in the ER getting shots in my head  I’ve been taking full spectrum CBD oil daily and it has helped more than any Rx med
3404 2018-11-29 18:35:45 I've been waiting for my oil to be changed for an hour

3406 2018-11-29 18:35:22 As you know I’m a GS man, but super fan boy I ain’t . Do m own oil change, but for all else it’s the garage
3407 2018-11-29 18:35:22 I used castor oil. I took it about 6 o’clock walked around the block and that night about 12 I started having contractions and I had a baby at noon.  It works! But taste horrible.
3408 2018-11-29 18:35:21 lemme get this straight; as we witness the ice caps melt, instead of being spurred into changing our ways we’re gonna invest in military hardware to fight for the remaining oil thats left beneath the ice? what happens when its all gone? you havent thought this thru have you boys!
3409 2018-11-29 18:35:20 If y’all see me lookin a lil greasy today I basically took a bath in essential oil this morning.
3410 2018-11-29 18:35:20 remind yo bitch to get a oil change
3411 2018-11-29 18:35:13 @mitchellreports Considering Tillerson has been Exxon Mobile Oil sales for Putin's Russian Oil close to 20yrs, seems he would know more about Russia & trump's working friendship- Maybe a Subpoena from Mueller?
3412 2018-11-29 18:35:09 I sure hope we are building up our oil reserves while prices are this low
3413 2018-11-29 18:35:07 @ColinCowherd @theherd Hue Jackson is a talentless snake oil salesman. @bakermayfield is our guy! Go troll some other town, you hack! #Browns

3415 2018-11-29 18:34:58 Tout le monde entend et comprends cet argument. Dans ce cas, établissons un plan d’urgence sur la transition pour les 10/15 ans à venir et affectons y le montant des taxes perçues à ce motif. Sans contrat clair = pas d’adhésion collective. Marre de payer pour boucher les trous
3416 2018-11-29 18:34:56 Obama takes credit for booming economy and oil production?  SMH. 

Outrageous claim.  What’s next...  That’s he’s the Messiah?   Wouldn’t surprise me in the least.  #thankyou @BarackObama #lmao

We're the journey not the destination 
3418 2018-11-29 18:34:49 So now let’s stop their oil.
3419 2018-11-29 18:34:48 Go. Get. Your. Oil. Changed. Now.
3420 2018-11-29 18:34:45 Castor oil & braids
3421 2018-11-29 18:34:42 Jeez you guys have a graph for everything. As an oil and gas lifer I can relate to the low leaver rates.
3422 2018-11-29 18:34:38 We should own the oil and pay companies only for the service of extracting it & refining it.
3423 2018-11-29 18:34:27 Grapeseed oil has been doing wonders for my skin and hair
3424 2018-11-29 18:34:23 Who are you blaming for lack of market access?  Oil ind. around 100+ years, first P/Lbuilt 1850. When AB was booming, why didn’t big oil/PCs have strategy to build more P/L?  Why didn’t Harper PCs assist TransCanads for P/L South. Offer solutions rather than play dirty politics.
3425 2018-11-29 18:34:22 Imagine being brainwashed to think that the US military started the Iraqi war because of foreign policy and to protect from terrorism and not because there’s oil in Iraq and that’s what they wanted all along LMAOOO

3427 2018-11-29 18:34:02 2 small oil paintings done by local Umbrian artists.
3428 2018-11-29 18:34:00 334
3429 2018-11-29 18:33:51 Also, the streets are extra slick because the oil is never washed away, and the gutters all flood into rivers and ponds. It’s a specific beast.
3430 2018-11-29 18:33:51 Norway had a light oil reserve, not a WCS/Dilbit reserve that is 90% used for asphalt, because of refining costs.  Changing the location of the refinery, won’t lower those set costs much to compete.   It’s just a poorer product, not able to compete on an even field.
3431 2018-11-29 18:33:49 He's assuming our memory is as bad as his.  But we remember how he and Hillary vowed to crush the coal industry and how he did not encourage oil drilling.
3432 2018-11-29 18:33:47 Madame Michetti le habló Ud. a Macron en "langue d'oíl" el francés del siglo X  que dio origen a todas las lenguas galas, o es impresión mia ? Porque él no le entendía, que poca cultura tiene ese hombre !
3433 2018-11-29 18:33:44 The feds are subsidizing dairy in it’s time of need. They just stated that auto will receive help. My original thought (plus the story) is why not oil?
3434 2018-11-29 18:33:44 If corn oil is made from corn and vegetable oil is made from vegetables. What is baby oil made from?
3435 2018-11-29 18:33:43 "Reggae music has been added to a United Nations list of global cultural treasures that should be protected ... along with hand puppetry, bobbin lacemaking and Turkish oil wrestling..."  WAIT WHAT? Straight to Google. Wow. No more pornhub for me.#newfetish
3436 2018-11-29 18:33:40 Only electric cars on sale in major markets by 2040. Peak oil use in 2031. But we're still f---cked on climate change, Wood Mackenzie says: 

Under the carbon-constrained scenario, WoodMac predicts by 2040, the US, EU and China will see electric vehicles account for 100% of new
3437 2018-11-29 18:33:36 Or maybe the Oil industry can shove it down BC pussies throats and we can get a contract thats fair
3438 2018-11-29 18:33:32 But we're still buying their oil 
3439 2018-11-29 18:33:30 Don’t care if people think Iceland’s palm oil campaign is cynical exploitation.  Just heard two women in the queue at Hemsworth Iceland saying they check everything they’re buying now and one explaining to the other about responsible replanting.  @rangtanforest @IcelandFoods
3440 2018-11-29 18:33:27 I wonder how sask farmers will respond to losing shipping to Alberta oil? This is a terrible plan. Oil already clogging the rail system.
3441 2018-11-29 18:33:08 I could also see it as something that has more rights bundled with it than usual, like a commercial commission that the client is going to sell prints of. Or something like a pretty large oil painting.
3442 2018-11-29 18:32:57 In all my travels, na Warri be the first place I dey see one of the hotel TV channels wholly dedicated to porn 24/7. 

No warning. 

No special demand.

No wonder small thing @nicholasibekwe will say he's coming here to investigate oil spills.
3443 2018-11-29 18:32:52 @OutnumberedFNC Iran is trying to control all middle east oil shipping lanes if they contro Yemen they can control Suez Canal and straits of Hormuz.
3444 2018-11-29 18:32:46 If you think pipelines are environmental issues wait until there are 100-200 extra rail cars of oil a day on the tracks given the amount of derailments that occur in western Canada regularly
3445 2018-11-29 18:32:45 Also, the next oil hell hole will be Algeria, they have 5 years of cash reserves on hand
3446 2018-11-29 18:32:44 Inflation is muted oil down 30+ % and lumber 50+ % is that inflation? Deflation more like

3452 2018-11-29 18:32:12 Before oil money, none of the club you mentioned except st Etienne could gather as much nationwide passion as psg despite being historically more successful on the pitch
3453 2018-11-29 18:32:10 Do you use cbd oil?
3454 2018-11-29 18:32:03 My what I hate, you’re literally driving my car 5ft away to change my oil and you feel the need to rearrange my fucking seat setting, like reallly bro???
3455 2018-11-29 18:31:53 You tried to strangle oil you liar.
3456 2018-11-29 18:31:51 Fact is Saudi Arabia has backed themselves into a corner, they should have kept producing at max  for the last 5 years, but they blinked. Now we have a manipulated oil price and producers all around the world that shouldn’t be in the market.
3457 2018-11-29 18:31:48 Other than putting a missile system in Poland, shipped weapons to Ukraine, killed over 200 Russian soldiers in Syria, undercut Russia's natural gas deal with Germany, getting world oil prices down which hurts Russia's economy, yeah, he has taken it real easy on Russia.
3458 2018-11-29 18:31:33 Loh! Avocados contain oil tho 
3459 2018-11-29 18:31:26 I'd already had two Nexk Oil and a Session. Gotta have dinner yet 
3460 2018-11-29 18:31:13 Now, as I watch the sunrise.
Ah, the smell of oil, the morning light.
There's but one shadow cast on the asphalt.
3461 2018-11-29 18:31:07 #OBAMA did zero for oil production.
Zero! Lie some more Barry O.
3462 2018-11-29 18:31:06 Someone buy me oil paint I’m going crazy watching satisfying oil YouTube tutorials
3463 2018-11-29 18:31:06 Well you do remember it's NON-RENEWABLE resource right? So think of it this way. You have gold. Price is very low. But you decide to sell it anyway. Once sold it is gone. So it's the same for oil. You are selling black gold low to keep money coming in for @YourAlberta
3464 2018-11-29 18:31:01 #AMLO wants to leave local #oil in Mexican soil to be consumed by future generations, apparently he does not want to export it to other countries #Mexico
3465 2018-11-29 18:30:58 You have solved only one problem.
But it was in favour of oil activism. 
I’m sure they are super happy you canceled all the pipeline projects!
3466 2018-11-29 18:30:56 He just can't stop can he?!  He stifled oil production.  But then nothing he did benefitted anyone but himself.  #obamagoaway
3467 2018-11-29 18:30:53 I do it almost every oil change
3468 2018-11-29 18:30:48 why I leased for the first time... oil changes ..thats it.. use to keep cars past their prime .. it's a gamble either way!!
3469 2018-11-29 18:30:40 Maybe you and the oil industry workers and their families can house share....

3474 2018-11-29 18:30:21 Now all they need to do is stop using Palm Oil in their products just how hard can that be ?
3475 2018-11-29 18:30:19 Pray over it and pour announcing oil on it

How can I be allergic to any kind of perfume??
3482 2018-11-29 18:29:54 Eh? The 1970s was a period of huge economic turmoil after the collapse of Bretton Woods and the 1973 oil shock. Both radical left and radical left abandoned the post-war consensus in this period as it collapsed.
3483 2018-11-29 18:29:50 Castor oil and a good boar bristle brush
3484 2018-11-29 18:29:48 I don't think sewer system breakdowns result in upwards of a decade of remediation work that in the end may not restore pristine situations right? I doubt that oil in the ocean off the coast of VanCity is going to be fixable.
3485 2018-11-29 18:29:48 Are you a Scottish, or an Irish McLaughlin?  Anyway, you have done us a great service Erin.  Because the English, want to keep stealing our oil and our other resources, our media's output is pure propaganda. Your honest reporting is refreshing. Thank you and more please. #Brexit
3486 2018-11-29 18:29:43 Same thing Trump did. No one will stop buying Saudi oil or selling weapons to them though. Left Right, when it comes to oil and weapons, they are all the same.
3487 2018-11-29 18:29:41 “Jobs of the past just aren’t gonna come back. What are you
going to do?  Wave a magic wand?”  Obama is taking credit for a great
economy that he, HIMSELF, said we would never see again.  Now oil production too. At first it was maddening, then funny, now it’s just  pathetic
3488 2018-11-29 18:29:40 You can bet @justintrudeau is already in bed with @JerryPDias & @UniforTheUnion hoods & working out some big present for them & GM.  But where is he on helping Alta & devastated oil industry workers?  Missing in action. Traitor! What the H#ell have Lib voters done?
3489 2018-11-29 18:29:31 Curious if the US could experience something new -- a recession sparked by low oil prices. It nearly happened three years ago.
3490 2018-11-29 18:29:30 you meant secret oil
3491 2018-11-29 18:29:27 I beleive any money that o get from any person via gift It’s necessary for me to get anointing oil and poor on that money and pray over it
3492 2018-11-29 18:29:27 And didn't Trump take credit for falling oil prices?  If this leads to those layoffs, watch how fast he deflects the blame.
3493 2018-11-29 18:29:23 69% of what?  69% growth of the size of the economy in 1993 you disingenuous snake oil merchant. In 1948 the economy was basically lard and Hovis and bits of metal. 118% growth of that was pitiful...that's why we had rationing long after everyone else had finished.
Go away, liar.
3494 2018-11-29 18:29:23 Not to sound like a conspiracy theorist but there has to be a huge connection between America's will for lower oil prices and their silence regarding the Crown Prince's involment in murder.
3495 2018-11-29 18:29:17 As are all business ventures & not to the same extent as green energy! The cost per capita per BTU for oil gas and coal is much more productive.
3496 2018-11-29 18:29:04 Still on the Yoruba Race:
The Western Region as contained in the present Oodua States never grudged the Centre being in opposition.
Rather they worked for its survival bearing in mind one question: "If there was no Oil & Gas, do we roast to death?"
A good lesson for the Ndi'gbo.
3497 2018-11-29 18:29:00 You pledged to increase the cost of oil. You never wanted cheap oil.
3498 2018-11-29 18:28:58 #oilprice raised 3% as Russia had accepted the need to cut production along with #OPEC ahead of its meeting next week

3499 2018-11-29 18:28:57 His oil revenue projections for the Scottish government must rank as the biggest miss in the history of biggest misses.
3500 2018-11-29 18:28:46 Is tea tree oil considered a chemical exfoliant ?!!?!! Like what is it classified as in skin care lmao :(
3501 2018-11-29 18:28:36 Beto would have been better but he still sucks. 1st in oil & gas and 2nd in hedge fund donations.
3502 2018-11-29 18:28:33 Amazing how some want to blame the liberals for all their woes.  What did the Conservatives do the previous 12 years to position the oil industry to be able to sell its oil??  Now we are all paying the price by losing billions in revenues.
3503 2018-11-29 18:28:27 Oil up more than $3 from earlier levels seen today.
3504 2018-11-29 18:28:23 
3505 2018-11-29 18:28:17 Has OGRA taken leave of its senses? Oil prices have plummeted in international market and OGRA recommends increase in petroleum prices locally? Is it a conspiracy against the Govt? For Heaven’s sake someone start talking sense and take hold of OGRA before it hurts the Govt.
3506 2018-11-29 18:28:16 1:26pm 29NOV currently *NO WAIT* For State Inspections, oil change, alignment, diagnostic, why wait when there is a Carmasters Vehicle Available at Carmasters Automotive for you to drive while yours is getting repaired (please schedule) #alignment #stateinspection #brakes #CEL
3507 2018-11-29 18:28:10 Have you considered taking an elementary school Science course to get you up to speed on what oil is and does?
It would be worth it if only so that you don't come off as a complete ignoramus.

3509 2018-11-29 18:27:59 Sources of U.S. Oil
Canada (40%) - #tRump kills trade deals, insults Trudeau 
Saudi Arabia (11%) - #tRump 'stands with them' after murder
Mexico (8%) - Trump calls them 'bad hombres'

#PutinsPuppet chooses his financial interests over our intelligence community. Again.
3510 2018-11-29 18:27:57 That video that revealed that syrup was actually motor oil has caused more disillusionment in the youth than World War I
3511 2018-11-29 18:27:55 I asked my dad to take my car for an oil change knowing damn well my tank was on E 
3512 2018-11-29 18:27:50 And I still gotta get an oil change lmfao.
3513 2018-11-29 18:27:40 Remember, "the squeaky wheel gets the oil."  Keep talking, talk, talk, talk. They hear you. They will try to ignore you but there's positive things about subliminal messages. You never give up and neither will I.
3514 2018-11-29 18:27:39 Let me guess climate change guys ? Meanwhile ice is thicker in parts of the oceans. Climate change begins with no more oil spills!!!! #canada #canadians #climate #bs #science says climate is ok just stop the smog and oil leaks and whatever fake sht goes on
3515 2018-11-29 18:27:37 Awwww yiss. Got a stronger version of my CBD oil. Also picked up some gummies!
3516 2018-11-29 18:27:32 Why are U.S. troops in the Middle East?
In an interview with the Washington Post U.S. President Donald Trump gives an answer:
Trump also floated the idea of removing U.S. troops from the Middle East, citing the lower price of oil as a reason to withdraw.

3518 2018-11-29 18:27:25 This weeks guide to twitter fame: quote a picture of pancakes saying something about how the syrup is motor oil
3519 2018-11-29 18:27:21 Breaking: Mueller is investigating Russia's sale of a 19.5% stake of Rosneft, their largest oil company, and any ties to Trump associates Carter Page and George Papadopoulos working with Cohen, Kushner, and Flynn in exchange for sanctions relief
3520 2018-11-29 18:27:20 He hated oil.
3521 2018-11-29 18:27:17 Don't have a long term view on oil. Too many variables at play. #Uranium offers the asymmetry I am looking for as a deep value investor.  Oil doesn't so I am ambivalent.  However, I am feeling bullish on NatGas as extreme weather from climate change is likely to increase demand.
3522 2018-11-29 18:27:05 Saw a head shop yesterday making cbd oil pods for juuls!
3523 2018-11-29 18:27:00 The edibles are not pure; spiked with dangerous and harmful material.Fruit is injected with colored.Vegetable is grown on dirty soil in drainage water.Milk,oil and other products are mixed with water,sugarcane juice,fertilizers and other chemicals. #AdulterationIsHaraam
3524 2018-11-29 18:26:59 Most of the people I hear saying they’re not holiday shopping on Amazon this year and are cancelling their Prime subscriptions are the same ones who hate the oil companies but drive an SUV.
3525 2018-11-29 18:26:39 Got paid early. Currently getting an oil change with a Groupon. Adulting in full affect today. Bad bitch things.
3526 2018-11-29 18:26:38 I’m convinced that when you go get your oil change they be trying to find other stuff wrong with you car. Im not changing no dang filter today. Leave me alone
3527 2018-11-29 18:26:38 I hate running errands. I just spent two hours at the bank and getting my oil changed. 
3528 2018-11-29 18:26:23 Try just fish. And adding more healthy fats like avocado, nuts, olive oil. And use a plant protein powder
3529 2018-11-29 18:26:22 That obozo did nothing for oil production , obozo did nothing for America. The true President is Trump, he got the oil industry back.
3530 2018-11-29 18:26:17 15k crore ka oil bond kiyn Liya jab itni hi acchi Neeti thi..Karnataka me kissanoo Ko Jail me dalte ho karz ke Naam par, Punjab k kissan atma hatya karte hai Lekin saari gaddar gang chup..Aaj tumahara Pak Bikhari ho Gaya hamare Modi ji ki wajah se..kabhi Desh k ghotale ka bhi bol
3531 2018-11-29 18:26:11 Questions to be answered. Is there track capacity? Is there bridge capacity through the Rockies? Is there a plan to build track to Alaska pipeline to access Pacific oil shipping port?
3532 2018-11-29 18:25:59 Gonna cost more for ins with no deductible,  cover, reg. maint/windshield wipers, cleaning/ oil& gas
3533 2018-11-29 18:25:56 LET THIS SINK IN: Proved reserves of US crude oil up 19.5% from 2016 surpassing peak in 1970. Proved reserves of natural gas increased 36.1% at year-end 2017 and breaking a 2014 record for total natural gas proved reserves.
3534 2018-11-29 18:25:52 There is also research to suggest that Lemon can help reduce feelings of anxiety and depression. Lemon essential oil is also good for this.
3535 2018-11-29 18:25:52 Use them as a hair mask! They're great for hydration. Mix it with honey and olive/coconut oil.
3536 2018-11-29 18:25:47 2 of 2
Paying cash (value+shopping+transparency!) for routine and expected expenses lowers all medical care costs.  Insurance should only be used for catastrophic/unexpected care. You don't buy car ins for cheap gas/oil changes. Health ins needs to go back to true risk transfer.
3537 2018-11-29 18:25:43 @johnmcdougallmd What are you saying about how healthy coconut oil is?
3538 2018-11-29 18:25:42 What a arrogant ,hypocrite he is.Yes oil production did increase a little bit,but it was is states that he had no control over. He instituted over 40k regulations,put in place over 100 pages of steps that companies had to go through to get permits to drill and stopped the pipel
3539 2018-11-29 18:25:42 honestly, just a big tray of roasted vegetables. Tossed in some olive oil, maybe some garlic or red pepper flakes, etc. Delicious.
3540 2018-11-29 18:25:40 @Archaeologuy @dstaples could the Oil sneak Sandheim out of Philly given all the chaos going on?
3541 2018-11-29 18:25:37 Replaced NAFTA, ended Obamacare mandate, oil pipeline, ISIS, North Korea negotiations, daily funny tweets, expand Senate power, stopped TPP, manufacturing jobs increasing.
3542 2018-11-29 18:25:37 Obama was the worst president in history for allowing drilling on Federal Land! Obama and his administration were an enemy to fracking which has produced this windfall in oil production! Obama and the truce are seldom very close!
3543 2018-11-29 18:25:35 Why not ask your American friends why they are driving down the world price of oil by flooding the world market with cheap sweet crude? He is doing more than Harper or your great white knights Scheer and Kenney.
3544 2018-11-29 18:25:31 you ever think youre squirting a lotion on ur hands and it turns out to be body oil and ur an oily mess in the middle of a whole foods
3545 2018-11-29 18:25:29 I use a blazing hot cast iron pan personally.  Pat the meat dry, brush with Avocado Oil/pepper and sear for color.
3546 2018-11-29 18:25:28 The lagoon & the statue of Rodin’s “The Thinker” bring back very fond memories for me!  My father used to spend quality time “bonding” with him hooking up a “battery powered” toy boat (actually a reproduction of a Texaco oil tanker) which he would “let go” on one end...
3547 2018-11-29 18:25:12 One of my fondest memories of college is when one of my friends, who I won’t name, told this young lady at the square that her Pussy smell like Tylenol and motor oil.
3548 2018-11-29 18:25:10 Oil absorbing sheets by clean & clear or any drugstore brand is good
3549 2018-11-29 18:25:05 Yes vitamin e oil is everything
3550 2018-11-29 18:24:56 #Oil reversed course and rose as much as 3 percent on Thursday, after industry sources said Russia had accepted the need to cut production, together with OPEC ahead of its meeting next week.
3551 2018-11-29 18:24:55 Oil is crucial...
Atleast make sure that there is enough oil in the car.
3552 2018-11-29 18:24:41 Just asked this man to fix my window, change my oil, and see if he can check my brake light. How is my car still running
3553 2018-11-29 18:24:40 These idiots have no idea the role oil plays in the production of everything they use on a daily basis.
3554 2018-11-29 18:24:37 Non-existent in @liberalparty or @Justintrudeau Or maybe it's just their pure unadulterated hate for any oil industry & its workers
3555 2018-11-29 18:24:31 Yes.... Oiled (lubed?) With very slimy putrid oil. 
3556 2018-11-29 18:24:26 Bon, on espère que Janco continuera, comme à son habitude, de ne pas faire de la langue de bois dans ce comité Théodule.
3557 2018-11-29 18:24:24 I think the vast majority of Canadians feel exactly the same. I would also like to see more Canadian oil at our pumps too.
3558 2018-11-29 18:24:18 Understand the point your making but you have to realise these fishermen are 5 wealthy Tory supporters one of them is Sir Ian Wood the fishing AND oil expert.  Torys have to look after them..until they decide they are explendable.
3559 2018-11-29 18:24:06 @BillGates I heard your father has Alzheimer's and that's sad to hear, has he tried M.C.T oil?

I heard it helps :)
3560 2018-11-29 18:24:03 If money matters how can #NMEducation be last in the nation when we spend more than 20 other states?  Also where will the money come form if we do away with oil and gas revenue?
3561 2018-11-29 18:24:01 And oil still they her lips
3562 2018-11-29 18:23:47 You do that. But, make sure you have a plan to keep Iran in check and protect the world's oil supply. I don't like Saudi either but there are worse people in this world and your plan needs to ensure their containment.
3563 2018-11-29 18:23:43 Lol I gotta oil and grease it a little
3564 2018-11-29 18:23:26 But yet Canada still imports Saudi oil.....
3565 2018-11-29 18:23:24 Whst is it with all the boilers??!!! Luckily immersion heater do still got hot water& electric and oil fired plug in radiators on...
3566 2018-11-29 18:23:20 UK internal market will have no Choice but to trade with Scotland regardless of borders or tariffs cause they are not. Self sustaining nation. Where else will they get their food, water, oil and Gas? With Independence we can set our own tariffs
3567 2018-11-29 18:23:16 Before applying makeup, use a primer or base. It'll help prevent oil production &amp; keep your skin &amp; makeup looking fresh for hours!
3568 2018-11-29 18:23:13 In all due fairness the deficit doubled during the 8yr Obama Presidency. While I've heard him recently take credit for the booming economy and oil production I have not heard him accept any responsibility for the deficit. Maybe I missed it?
3569 2018-11-29 18:23:10 Some very tough oil  conditions are knocking jobs out across Western Canada. Your not thinking of everyone affected. Hang in there and you’ll think of the super complicated solution to this problem @MichelleRempel @AndrewScheer @jkenney
3570 2018-11-29 18:23:06 OMG Blood Orange Olive Oil + 
Dark Chocolate Balsamic Vinegar = Terry’s Chocolate Orange
The perfect Christmas gift.
Drop in and sample - it’s amazing
3571 2018-11-29 18:22:56 The male 45+ age group is delusional in the oil & gas industry.. bitch about millennials being lazy 24/7.. Even tho you stall EVERY SINGLE PROJECT bc ur slow and ur work ethic is shit bc u think millennials owe u something & will/should do the work 4 u. WE WONT. BYE.
3572 2018-11-29 18:22:55 Just a note here. Just read from some source that the oil price went just below $50/barrel.
3573 2018-11-29 18:22:43 Would help if you could add in a slice to your pie chart that splits out the argument about level of re-exports (transshipment) through Rotterdam, Antwerp and the Netherlands. Estimate I think was about £10 billion in 2010 excluding oil.
3574 2018-11-29 18:22:43 Yeah 2014-2015 saying the days of relying on oil/fossil fuels in the US are over...buy a Volt!   See where that got GM.
3575 2018-11-29 18:22:33 At least she wants to help the climate thwart disaster unlike “drill baby drill” Republicans and my family has land with proven oil field on it.
3576 2018-11-29 18:22:28 Razonable
3577 2018-11-29 18:22:27 ايش بؤمكم على سلولو
3578 2018-11-29 18:22:26 No, because already Keynesian economics were dominant at the time, and the perception was that Keynesians had no answers for stagflation--frankly, it's not like they could have anyway (Bretton Woods collapsed thanks to Nixon, the Oil Embargo wasn't something we could affect).
3579 2018-11-29 18:22:24 Olive oil mayo!
3580 2018-11-29 18:22:19 I knows but 65% don't care about our parent cuz they're different care about so many women and child that er suffering,,Some took to Almajiri some er just redundant ,

3582 2018-11-29 18:22:01 But Trump is more slippery than a walrus dipped in crude oil and saliva, just not as attractive.
3583 2018-11-29 18:21:58 Idek why I’m lying to myself about getting this oil change Saturday. 8 am in the rain? Shiidddd.
3584 2018-11-29 18:21:58 I don't think allowing government to decide oil production is such a great idea. Have the last three years of anti-oil governments taught you nothing. Leave it to the market to sort things out
3585 2018-11-29 18:21:58 I didn't save the link, but I can take a snapshot.  BTW it was one of Aurora   THC drops.  I just typed "high thc oil" & got a hit with Aurora.
3586 2018-11-29 18:21:56 Please make sure y’all dilute tea tree oil with water. That shit burned my ass.
3587 2018-11-29 18:21:53 Yes, I make an effort to shop sustainably, buying less, buying from charity shops, or from ethical brands. I also run @YOU_underwear & we try to make a difference with ethical underwear that gives back. Fashion is the second most harmful industry after oil & it has to change.
3588 2018-11-29 18:21:47 Don’t forget the smart meters...
3589 2018-11-29 18:21:46 looks like profit just follows oil price
3590 2018-11-29 18:21:43 Okay waiting one more day to get an oil change won’t hurt right? Like my car ain’t gonna just stop working right lmaoo
3591 2018-11-29 18:21:41 Cry some more! Hilary lost and you continue to cry! Now, even Barack is crying for his legacy. He is taking credit for oil drilling and jobs! Ha, ha, ha! For years while in office Barack was blaming Bush! Tell him to shut up and go to Hawaii! Buy a spread and raise hogs!
3592 2018-11-29 18:21:38 Motor oil
3593 2018-11-29 18:21:37 EX-President Obama.  Here’s one for you. You claim you are responsible for the increase in oil production. Your EPA went from 60-80 page documents to 600-800 pages for oil exploration. Halted Gulf of Mexico oil production for six months. Key pipeline is B.S.
3594 2018-11-29 18:21:26 I need a recommendation for bath bombs for my girls. @lushcosmetics has decided to put up a smear campaign against Alberta Oil Sands (not tar sands). Our home will no longer have Lush products. Kind of a shame, good products we spent lots of money on #yeg #Alberta
3595 2018-11-29 18:21:25 Canada leads the G7 in oil and gas subsides
3596 2018-11-29 18:21:24 that oil a mf 
3597 2018-11-29 18:21:21 Also this is a lie. I put grapeseed oil in my lotion YOU WISH!
3598 2018-11-29 18:21:19 In the last 3 days I had to get 3 new tires, an oil change, washer fluid and my car inspected
3599 2018-11-29 18:21:06 Since we discovered oil, our economic life has rather become raw. I think we discovered CRUDE OIL! 
#PunCakes
3600 2018-11-29 18:20:56 Deforestation from palm oil: 26 million acres 
Deforestation from animal agriculture: 136 million acres 
Both are so devastating, so why do we only get told about one?  #vegan #deforestation
3601 2018-11-29 18:20:55 Hey can you send me that? It’s always sold out around here. Wanna do my truck before the winter hits
3602 2018-11-29 18:20:48 They would do well not to talk that way.  U.S. oil, much like nature, "finds a way".
3603 2018-11-29 18:20:39 My goal is to be an #alphamale tweeter that sells marijuana oil.
3604 2018-11-29 18:20:39 Got my hair cut, went grocery shopping AND got my oil changed...all before 2pm. I AM FUCKING KILLIN IT RN SOMEBODY STOP ME
3605 2018-11-29 18:20:27 He also rubs his body entirely with baby oil everyday so 
3606 2018-11-29 18:20:16 Why would she even think that she'd be given a meaningful amount of control? Where has she ever said that she has? 

She's working towards a goal, the green new deal committee. w/o any members of congress who take money from oil. If she gets that, she wins, if not, she doesn't.
3607 2018-11-29 18:20:01 Ok, well, we ALL know that @JustinTrudeau will still allow eastern Cda to import Saudi oil, so why is this vote surprising to anyone.
3608 2018-11-29 18:20:00 It’s not our population causing pollution as much as it’s our industry. We don’t suck up oil like a straw. Ours is steamed like a Cappuccino and the grounds dumped on the floor for someone else to clean up....whenever
3609 2018-11-29 18:19:48 Use the 10 million to stake claims in Bear’s Ears and prevent mining and oil industry from killing it!  Protect our national treasures!
3610 2018-11-29 18:19:47 Ethically made perhaps, but the reality is that bitumen is the most water-, land-, waste- and GHG-intensive oil to produce.
3611 2018-11-29 18:19:43 Paillmoon  .....(it's an anagram of "No Palm Oil")
3612 2018-11-29 18:19:37 They probably forgot to reset the oil count , I would take it back to em, or press the reset button
3613 2018-11-29 18:19:28 They are just tight-arses that don't want to spend £money @BMWMotorrad but they do like the attention to detail. I photograph each job do you can see the oil change etc was really carried out
3614 2018-11-29 18:19:21 That certainly explains the $10 oil.

Is building a refinery an option so we can at least buy and use our own oil, and get decent market value rather than sell low and buy high from elsewhere?
3615 2018-11-29 18:19:13 Posmaruj bio oil i olejem kokosowym, zakrywałam pudrem no i długie rękawy
3616 2018-11-29 18:19:11 @SierraClub Former Pres. Obama just "bragged" about the increases in US oil production every year of his tenure at an oil summit.  Why is no one censuring him for his actions in contributing to fossil fuel use and climate change??????
3617 2018-11-29 18:19:10 man hasn't slept in a week and ia running off of nothing but coffee and engine oil. he has limits.
(also I can't believe there is already an emoji for venom.)
3618 2018-11-29 18:19:08 Not like we’re eating the oil, cardboard and glue lol
3619 2018-11-29 18:19:02 OK... so @BarackObama 
You were anti: 
 PIPELINE 
 DRILLING 
 REOPENING WELLS
VOWED TO MAKE GAS PRICES HIGHER, and MANY people here in #Houston lost their jobs because of it. 
YET you have the nerve to come here and take credit for low oil prices
#Revolt
#TWGRP45
#TTU1
3620 2018-11-29 18:19:01 the snake oil salesman will make everything better!
3621 2018-11-29 18:18:59 @MichelleRempel I was curious. Over the last 10 days, the number of job losses to do with the oil and gas industry in downtown Calgary is another ~600ppl (unofficially). Just curious if anyone stood up from the Liberal side and vowed to provide support through difficult times.
3622 2018-11-29 18:18:56 馬油を英訳すると…うーむ(中の人の英語力の限界)
3623 2018-11-29 18:18:56 The "too little, too late" Premier should just drop the writ and get the election underway. She & her gov't are lame ducks whose sudden epiphany about the importance of oil & gas to Alberta spent 3 years trying to stymie the industry but now want to save it. @notleymustgonow
3624 2018-11-29 18:18:52 Very true: he's missing out the bit of the 1970s with the oil shock etc (though, as far as I recall, average GDP growth in the 1970s is the same as the 1980s but don't quote me on that)
3625 2018-11-29 18:18:46 I received a bottle of olive oil from Lebanon as a gift & 15 minutes later I dropped it on my office floor & some oil went down the heat duct & there is a massive stain on my carpet & my office smells like popcorn don't @ me.
3626 2018-11-29 18:18:45 That's half the issue too, the land is purchased and often sat on while money is raised for exploration...if there's no oil the land is just left post survey. Not really a huge job creator or revenue stream of taxes.
3627 2018-11-29 18:18:44 I was lowkey hurt I wasn’t @‘d earlier.But I think Denise covered it. I’d recommend a pen cause you won’t get “as high” or you can control your high better. Cbd oil is a good idea, I like the stizzy mango cbd oil. stizzy is company but their carts only work w/ a specific battery
3628 2018-11-29 18:18:32 I received one of those alerts yesterday. It is amazing how citizen surveillance and systems of state security never fail to work while political transparency, for example, about Canada’s continuously expanding oil pipelines remains rare.
3629 2018-11-29 18:18:31 Yeah we shouldn't be all kind Life is varietie We must not be one of kind and those u er talking about I can said they learned it form they Naigbours and that's taking care of wives we want it here Not any other Regional of Nigeria let dem come here and learn a lot about marriage

3631 2018-11-29 18:18:07 फ्रेंड:- आपके पति *किस फ़ील्ड में* काम करतें है ?

पत्नि:- *Oil & Gas*

फ्रेंड:- वाह ... कहां पर पोस्टिंग है ?

पत्नि:- *किचन में!* 

3632 2018-11-29 18:18:05 All corporate-owned administrations need to get out of the pockets of the oil industry, and take real action to reduce greenhouse gasses, improve land use.

We need to stop pretending either right or liberal oil stooges are better.

The public wants action & accountability.
3633 2018-11-29 18:17:59 Don’t forget some biggies:
- what I can say
- what I can believe
- what I can criticize
3634 2018-11-29 18:17:56 @tedlieu @CoryBooker 
Do oil companies get subsidies from the US taxpayer?
3635 2018-11-29 18:17:51 i like making a stir fry with my tiny pan because when it starts spitting oil i feel like a wizard
3636 2018-11-29 18:17:45 We're told USA's #electricsystem is ancient!
We're now pumping more oil than #SaudiArabia.

So why is #GM/#Tesla & other auto manufacturers switching plants to build #ElectricCars
Where's the money to fix & upgrade transmission lines?
Do we need to build #nuclearpowerplants?

3638 2018-11-29 18:17:44 What a liar. He tried to cripple the oil industry. He is to full of himself. HE DID NOTHING.
3639 2018-11-29 18:17:38 He needs to be more than sanction. He should be tried, convicted, and jailed by the international court. Saudi interests need to be purged. We don't need their oil. We are producing more of our own.
3640 2018-11-29 18:17:26 I’m getting my oil changed and Ariana Grande is playing on the radio and these guys are all singing along lmaoo
3641 2018-11-29 18:17:24 To be fair, I believe he’s talking about his personal production of snake oil and flatulence, so...
3642 2018-11-29 18:17:23 Don't forget to get some heating oil so your HDD doesn't cool down too much and crack.
3643 2018-11-29 18:17:23 I don’t work in oil and gas industry but we all are impacted by it in our daily life.  Tell me about your RAM truck n
3644 2018-11-29 18:17:22 13. I’m talking about the mother f----s poisoning the poor people’s water with fracking oil, I’m talking about slave labor and no health care. I’m talking about the entire financial system and everyone in it who’s robbing us blind. I’m talking about labor unions being destroyed.
3645 2018-11-29 18:17:19 Someone overheard two oil workers at the local coffee shop talking.  That's all it takes for walk street
3646 2018-11-29 18:17:18 All I wanted to do was come get my oil changed & now they keep telling me everything that’s wrong with my car.

Maybe I should stop turning my music up louder whenever my car sounds like it’s breaking down.
3647 2018-11-29 18:17:18 If you are a prince, from an oil rich Arab country, you are allowed to murder opponents with the full backing and support of the USA.  But if you are poor, from Latin America, seeking a new beginning in the USA, you will be tear-gassed at the Mexican border and be denied entry.
3648 2018-11-29 18:17:17 The problem with large scale deployment comes back to my original statement.... Because of the amount we spend on the military and oil companies... the math isn’t hard to figure out.
3649 2018-11-29 18:17:09 Why do I make an oil change appointment for 10, arrive at 9:58, and get stuck waiting for help until ? 10:20? 10:30?
I have things to do, @ToyotaofClovis.
3650 2018-11-29 18:17:01 I need The Scent of a curly headed black woman in the form of a body oil... That shit smells Heavenlyy,  Call it Cocoa Goddess lol
3651 2018-11-29 18:17:00 Yes dude..! But not all of us lem me say 30%

3653 2018-11-29 18:16:54 Unfortunately our streets aren’t built for rain. First big rain = oil mixed with water witch causes many accidents. They there is the potholes that all of a sudden pop up when it rains. Our roads suck.
3654 2018-11-29 18:16:52 Didn't that Manchester team that wears the fairy blue kits laugh off the Anfield atmosphere last year.  Oil money can buy players and trophies, but it can't buy atmosphere.
3655 2018-11-29 18:16:47 The olive oil is the vehicle 
3656 2018-11-29 18:16:45 Add some mozzerella, oil, balsamic vinegar, herbs, mmmm yummy
3657 2018-11-29 18:16:42 Does he check your oil and tyre pressures at the same time?
3658 2018-11-29 18:16:41 Once Legault seriously starts promoting the oil and gas industry within Quebec...I’ll change my tune. The only way is to start educating the public...until then, nothing will change!
3659 2018-11-29 18:16:40 have the young physics students get together and procure the tests or examinations as the hood calls it  and make a case that colorado mining schools said many important things about oil shale drilling and yet hano was never mentioned in the fine print and yet $2000 is not a lot
3660 2018-11-29 18:16:39 The day you understand that we can move to change and be creative how to weed out oil from our everyday thing that day we will win the challenge
3661 2018-11-29 18:16:26 With all due respect, great leaders don't just cancl meetings. Great leaders make their enemies feel a lot of pain. Which would be like no SWIFT or oil embargo.
3662 2018-11-29 18:16:22 Sanctions? What a joke.
I bet she’s on the phone right now telling them to keep that oil coming!
She hates western Canada and would much rather have Saudi oil.
3663 2018-11-29 18:16:04 @BarackObama Is the same buffoon that did everything he could to stop and put out of business the oil industry. Said @realDonaldTrump would need a "Magic Wand" to bring JOBS back to America! Now this shyster wants people to think HE brought the economy back! bHUSSEINo #POSSOB
3664 2018-11-29 18:15:59 I need an oil change
3665 2018-11-29 18:15:53 Becton, Dickinson and Company's Double Large Cup O' Cinnabar, now with Relish 'n' Olive oil
3666 2018-11-29 18:15:45 Bought this lil dude coding books last week. Trying to get my youngest that coding wand for Christmas. Tech ain’t never going nowhere oil and gas is.
3667 2018-11-29 18:15:37 And now claims the US as an oil producer is because of him and we should "thank him".  Yeah. Right.
3668 2018-11-29 18:15:31 Manchester United should give De Gea whatever he asks for - money, House, women, oil anything and make sure he signs a contract. Stop giving bumper contracts to Smalling  Young and give this guy what he asks for!!

3669 2018-11-29 18:15:31 VIP Turns Oil Changes Into Cash for Local Schools. Lebanon School District received a check for $3,035. Thank you, VIP West Lebanon.
3670 2018-11-29 18:15:27 Is there a such thing as oil based stick foundations?
3671 2018-11-29 18:15:19 Has to be the most heavily shorted oil stock in Canada
3672 2018-11-29 18:15:18 The words "intelligent" and "Trump" do not belong in the same sentence. They are like oil & water.
3673 2018-11-29 18:15:11 Cars are better powered by oil. Yes, oil is yucky, but it's a reliable fuel source. Shame our politicians wish to phase it out. Not to mention they travel around by oil-powered limousines. HYPOCRITES! #Cars #Ecars #EVs
3674 2018-11-29 18:15:04 So, do you think oil prices went down to maybe have Trump gain favor?  He either try to buy you or blackmail you.
3675 2018-11-29 18:15:02 Lemon and dahi mixture. Add olive oil to it. Mix it and apply it. Keep it in for like 30 mins. Do this every 4th of 5th day.
3676 2018-11-29 18:14:56 Good question, usually you can know the difference looking at the ingredients, as natural cheese should be made with milk and culture- that’s it! Processed cheese is a vegetable oil emulsion mixed with cheese remnants and flavors, enhancers, and stabilizers.
3677 2018-11-29 18:14:53 1004 S Desplaines St: caller says two men are stealing oil from the BP. #ChicagoScanner
3678 2018-11-29 18:14:52 Which is wonderful!  Thank you for doing that. We need to do that all over the country. We need to phase out coal power production, and we need to create more incentives for electric vehicles and reduce our dependence on oil.
3679 2018-11-29 18:14:50 Your Dad is a good soul. That oil, rice, pepper and whatnot could mean a world of difference to someone or an entire family, give it!
3680 2018-11-29 18:14:37 Ya I don't like oil at the moment . But 3.98 3.99 I can live with
3681 2018-11-29 18:14:26 I just found my $60 Moroccan HAIR oil bottle in my brothers bathroom 1/4 used and he was like I use it for behind me ears because they are dry...I literally hate boys. #crustyass
3682 2018-11-29 18:14:25 He is part of this globalist Trudeau Goverment&Trudeau’s only concern is a seat on the UN. He could care less about the Canadian oil industry or GM closing. He cares about his voting base & getting to the UN. So you liberals better open your mind soon because your silence betrays
3683 2018-11-29 18:14:25 I’d be sad too if someone dumped motor oil on perfectly good pancakes
3684 2018-11-29 18:14:21 I wonder how all these rail cars being bought for #oil shipping is going to impact grain transportation. #albertarailcardeal #canadiangraintransport
3685 2018-11-29 18:14:19 He’s Lying. They artificially pumped certain stocks even when bad economic data. Apple, Amazon, Facebook and others were allowed to become monopoly companies... Oil and steel stocks were down and some went out of business. #Qanon
3686 2018-11-29 18:14:17 I literally be so busy that I have to write on my dry erase calendar these reminders to oil my scalp, apply my acne mask, call people back, but it works so 
3687 2018-11-29 18:14:16 Hahaha you say no evidence because you need their oil and the profitable arms trade.
3688 2018-11-29 18:14:14 I'll get the coconut oil
3689 2018-11-29 18:14:11 @WalmartInc store 05326 YOUR  AUTO DEPT SUCKS? we waited an hour for a oil change. When we asked how long before we get serviced, the clerk said "we don't give times" what why? No answer ok never using YOUR  AUTO DEPT EVER AGAIN.

3695 2018-11-29 18:13:28 O/N Wrap:
A much calmer evening session - currencies broadly on hold, Asian and European equities a touch higher, US indices a touch lower; US-China trade concerns back in focus ahead of #G20Argentina; mild oil rebound on #OPEC production reduction talk.

3697 2018-11-29 18:13:11 @CanadianTire I bought new winter tires and had them installed recently. I opted in to a promotion via text that said I would get a free oil change for doing so. I haven’t received any reply. Help?

3699 2018-11-29 18:13:04 And get your head around this, MAGAMAN. I will never support a man who tells me my son risked his life in Desert Storm for oil and the military-industrial complex that along with Wall Street has been dominating this country since the end of WWII. Take a hike, tool.
3700 2018-11-29 18:13:02 Oil ko na lang bebe
3701 2018-11-29 18:12:58 Makes me laugh that just because I work at a department store customers assume I know everythinnnnng about the products, like I dunno what brake oil you should get or whether John smiths bitter or original is better ffs
3702 2018-11-29 18:12:49 My goodness you must work on an oil rig or something! Anyways, enjoy your break :)
PS which one are you? (I would be the shaky middle one)

3704 2018-11-29 18:12:34 Does anyone remember Obama saying that WE don't need to drill Our own oil...We will just BUY it from Brazil? BE their "Best Customer".
3705 2018-11-29 18:12:30 Lol. What about the crude oil prices?
3706 2018-11-29 18:12:13 HA! And replace it with what? 
If you and the rest of the hyeenas quit screaming empty nonsense about "ethical oil" and laid down the capital for some upgrade infrastructure, Canada wouldn't need Saudi oil and would have a bangin' economy on top of it.
3707 2018-11-29 18:12:05 Dear Mr Al Falih, we are a Swiss-base oil & gas investor. Our ongoing studies reveal a market expectation of 1.1 - 1.2 Mb/d cut to keep Brent >$60. Less or no deal will likely cause a $10 price signal to producers worldwide in Dec/Jan, rightly or wrongly so. Truly yours, A.Stahel

3709 2018-11-29 18:12:01 That youth wave that doesn't want to work? Who want to make $$ dollars without paying any dues. The same ones who have no idea what's really happening in the business world? The ones that say oil "deserves" to die? Just making sure I understand.
3710 2018-11-29 18:12:00 The upcoming G20 conference could serve the government of Mauricio Macri as the perfect forum to search for more investments for the country’s promising oil and gas industry.

3711 2018-11-29 18:11:55 Let the righteous man strike me; let his rebuke be an act of loving devotion. It is oil for my head; let me not refuse it. For my prayer is ever against the deeds of the wicked. ~Psalm 141:5
3712 2018-11-29 18:11:54 Falling Oil Prices May Make Trump Happy but They Pose Risks for U.S.: FOR THE U.S. ????? WHAT KINDA BULLSHIT IS THIS !! THE ONLY RISK IS FOR THE PHUK'N REPUBLICUNT FINANCIAL & "OIL" CORPORATE "KOCH"-SUKKAS' POCKETBOOKS !!!!!!
3713 2018-11-29 18:11:46 If he gets ONGC director Post without knowing ABC of OIL technology, what is wrong if rahul gandhi wins loksabha seat and elected by Janata gets congress president's post constitutionally. On the otherhand the underhand dealing of BJP appointing as director shockingly justified
3714 2018-11-29 18:11:31 Meanwhile UK Army is being absorbed & put under EU Army control since LEAVE Vote. Uk Troops in Ukraine. Germany depends on Soviet Oil & Gas so EU will need DIRECT Tax to fund EU Army. EU ambitions are to take over VAT. Then VAT would go through the roof
3715 2018-11-29 18:11:30 Rates up and oil rebound?
3716 2018-11-29 18:11:29 Coastal Resource Management is the only solution for a sustainable ‘Blue Economy’ under the present climate change scenario due to oil pollution. Data procurement & other research by Asian Marine Conservation Association would be very helpful assisting firm policy on this.
3717 2018-11-29 18:11:23 The TimeBoys are bewildered by oil rigs.
3718 2018-11-29 18:11:15 Energy sector should by now figure out how to process oil so no oil import is required in Canada.

Governement should figure out how to lower the trade deficit with China, possibly increasing oil exports there.
3719 2018-11-29 18:11:11 Everyone needs to get with the project, but this grade school "I'm not moving till they do" attitude just guarantees the worst of the impacts will be realized. We need to do what we can, and truth is we can make money doing it. Green energy sector is booming. Drop coal & oil.
3720 2018-11-29 18:11:09 Thank you for this post I  never thought this was such a racket. I know  of reports of fake olive oil not tomatoes . Guess next will have fake twinkies.

3723 2018-11-29 18:10:39 NO MINERAL OIL
3724 2018-11-29 18:10:38 “For the first time in 40 years, major oil refineries are being planned for construction in the United States......to go online in 2019 in Texas, near the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford Shale, respectively.”
3725 2018-11-29 18:10:33 You are a sad troll then.
3726 2018-11-29 18:10:33 Mechanic just told me, "You don't have an oil leak. Your truck IS an oil leak. Where's it NOT leaking?"
3727 2018-11-29 18:10:32 I do not know whether I could live without coconut water. And coconut oil.
3728 2018-11-29 18:10:31 I would point out briefly that this is my profession, and a professional account. I do this all day every day and have worked on countrywide masterplanning and development all over the world. Even the big oil firms and oil producing nation's would agree that oil is on its way out

3737 2018-11-29 18:09:56 .@RachelNotley's plan to enable 2 trains a day for oil transport means purchasing 80 locomotives and more than 7,000 rail cars. Ambitious plan, wants federal government help. @TorontoRBOT

3748 2018-11-29 18:09:14 Beto is the latest Democrat “Rising Stars.” Darling of the liberals who can’t see he is a centrist falsely portraying himself as a progressive. He takes huge amounts of corp cash (esp. oil) and waffles on Medicare for All, $15 min wage, and climate breakdown.
3749 2018-11-29 18:09:12 And everyone's sovereign debt is in the same position.  But only the USD has a monopoly on the pricing of Russia's biggest export & China's biggest import.  Neither can afford to allow US to print for US entitlemts while oil only still priced in USD.  Only thing all trust = gold.
3750 2018-11-29 18:09:12 If you Kenney supporters really wanted to help Albertans youwould ask for a minimum royalty per barrel  paid to albertans whether the oil co makes money or not,this would straighten out the bitumen bubble in a hurry,but not elect Kenney,but that's ok

3753 2018-11-29 18:09:05 If so, he's gotta right, Sarah! Obama gets no credit for anything good bc your group only believes Loudmouth Trump's lies. You so want to believe that it's all been him, but that's Bullsh*t! And, yes, the US did become a Top Oil Producer under OBAMA not the #TrumpRegime.
3754 2018-11-29 18:09:00 I’m just gonna say it. Oil field workers are the most stuck up. It’s good money but that don’t make everyone forget the little bitch you were in high school. You got a pick up truck and spent 5k on tires?? WAY TO GO BUDDY!! Soon as that job ends, how you gon pay car note?

Only Oil!
3762 2018-11-29 18:08:08 If President Obama believes he has credit for oil boom, why should we be mad about it.  President Obama governed in the past.

3768 2018-11-29 18:07:52 That is the whole point. You’re justifying military spending to perpetuate the dumbing down and pollution of the planet. I am saying we need to lessen it. There are plenty of renewable energy sources now. It is time we are less dependent on oil.

3781 2018-11-29 18:06:22 Guess what, there are other industries, other technologies, other ways to pay bills! Oil companies are flush with cash, make them pay and hire Albertans to clean up the derelict oil bills. They can employ Albertans cleaning up their messes.

3784 2018-11-29 18:06:09 Because China's economy is about 20x larger than Russia's. Besides selling gas/oil to Europe Russia has nothing of value to trade. Look around your house, ho many things are made in Russia, how many in China? How many US companies get parts and equipment from Russia vs China?

3807 2018-11-29 18:04:31 Rachel,the public needs to know of the sweetheart royalty deals left by the former PCs that reduces albertans royalties to zero when sold under the cost of production.A minimum royalty per barrel would effectively shut in oil by the producer at cost of production plus royalty.

3832 2018-11-29 18:02:45 No hostility, it was an honest advise. You have a potential to do more, instead of criticising left, find larger problems to solve, you will find solidarity.
3833 2018-11-29 18:02:45 bad for both, but you cannot compare one company to a hole sector, now if you look at the auto industry in a hole it employs directly 101,000 and another 311,000 indirect. All of Alberta’s mining and oil & gas extraction industry employs 140,000. Like I said they are both bad

3845 2018-11-29 18:01:44 I see it as they are being punished for what they did, this punishment got us cheaper oil, if it happens again I expect further action. If it does happen again and there isn't further action, I will rescind support.
3846 2018-11-29 18:01:42 @cbchh reported @RachelNotley was willing to buy railcars to get our oil to US markets. I thought it was to get to NEW markets.They've got us over a barrel already in the USA. Her guests are quoting the price of a pipeline that may never be built.Fact:it was built in the 1950's!
3847 2018-11-29 18:01:36 What if we ditched oil and used the abandoned pipelines to transfer huge amounts of desalinated rising ocean water to parts of the country that are in dire need of water? That’d be so cool.
3848 2018-11-29 18:01:34 Right, I love orangutans so that's it for me and palm oil. I am aff it. The only time I'll even consider using any kind of palm oil is MAYBE Valentine's Day, unless my social life picks up.
3849 2018-11-29 18:01:33 Two industries in peril who have propped up our country economically forever.  Putting aside environment, politics, etc it sure does look as if auto and dairy see better treatment than oil

3894 2018-11-29 17:58:59 I ain't playing. It takes time to get the right angles. The black and white filters and the color pics. The body oil. The matching panties. I'm not rushing it mami.

3898 2018-11-29 17:58:49 You are right @KerrenceMcLeod which is why it's so disappointing that they CHOOSE to use dirty palm oil. All they have to do is stop using dirty palm oil, but they won't cause the put profit before the planet

3900 2018-11-29 17:58:42 I seem to recall a whole slew of Guardian 'peak oil' stories ~2012. No self-critical sense.

3904 2018-11-29 17:58:29 Why when the price of Oil is down 30% is it not reflected in the price of petrol 
3905 2018-11-29 17:58:27 But still continue to import Saudi oil?!?! #cdnpoli
3906 2018-11-29 17:58:25 even if oil going higher ?
3907 2018-11-29 17:58:21 All this talk about the flu shot I never got it once in my life and have been fine... I take vitamins, black seed oil & oil of oregano every day which seems to work well 
3908 2018-11-29 17:58:15 How long have people believed everyone is lying about climate change except for oil companies?
3909 2018-11-29 17:58:09 Where can I order some coconut oil ?
3910 2018-11-29 17:58:07 1/ The US Military (ie the Navy) subsidizes the worlds oil prices by keeping transportation lines safe from pirates.

Drugs are definitely out of control, have been for a long time, has nothing to do with Trump but giving huge discounts to countries like Sweden.
3911 2018-11-29 17:57:58 We’ve stopped buying your products and anything that contains palm oil. Until you stop using palm oil we’ll never buy it again.
3912 2018-11-29 17:57:57 This weather is doing nothing for my skin. Somebody come pour a jar of coconut oil on me

3914 2018-11-29 17:57:45 Except we're talking about oil and gas firms asking DOI to put federal land for sale for industrial or commercial exploits..you or I cant buy a plot of industrial land and use it for residential purpose. DOI complies, it floods the market, allowing firms to get insane discounts.
3915 2018-11-29 17:57:44 Most cars oil sensors won't go off if there's so much as a teaspoon of oil in it. Coolants too. 

Faults they purposely install to make you go back to dealership garages for repairs
3916 2018-11-29 17:57:44 Pretty sure my coworker farted and now it smells like eggs and motor oil
3917 2018-11-29 17:57:42 Jake you seriously must be high as shit. Obama ran this country into the ground. Regulated every dam thing that made this country great.  Restricted oil production, closed coal mines, gave billions to companies for clean energy and they all flopped. Screwed up healthcare  loser
3918 2018-11-29 17:57:42 When buying motor oil, here's something you need to know: the "W" after a number refers to winter, not weight. The lower the number, the better the oil's flow-rate, or viscosity, in low temperatures.
3919 2018-11-29 17:57:37 I love robotic oil poffins~!
3920 2018-11-29 17:57:17 That's right! Just look at the oil & gas industry - still receives billions per year in subsidies even after more than a century of innovation. Nice try Faisad.

3923 2018-11-29 17:57:08 Just used some the other day making some coconut oil for someone & I did give it a Lil kick with a half g of some wax but it turned out absolutely dynamite 
3924 2018-11-29 17:57:08 That’s laughable given his contempt for fossil fuel and anything he could do to limit the need for oil and move the oil! Hahahaha
3925 2018-11-29 17:57:01 Ha! And who cleans up the oil spill?! 
3926 2018-11-29 17:56:59 So is Canada going to stop buying Saudi oil?  I know a place where they can get oil, and make Canadians lots of money in the process.  Hit me up if you need the info. #canpoli @JustinTrudeau @gmbutts @cathmckenna

3929 2018-11-29 17:56:42 Every person can collaborate to suffocate oil & gas.
Buy a new or used EV. this immediately removes you from sending cash to Big Oil. big oil companies capital structures depend on growth. It takes a few million EV's to remove growth & destabilize Big Oil. They can JUST fail.

3931 2018-11-29 17:56:31 MSNews never gets across is ABs royalty base rises and falls with the price of oil,declining to nothing under the cost of production about$28/bbl.so if AB set a min of $10/bbl royalty it would automatically create a shut in point for producers,even those making money refining

3933 2018-11-29 17:56:21 I am sure that it is what he is hoping for, but anything else would sound like a provocation and add oil to the fire for Brexiters. Most Europeans are holding themselves from saying too much. Brits don't like to be told by foreigners what is best for them.

3936 2018-11-29 17:56:13 Yes, her cooking abilities are something to marvel at. If Sophia is lucky, her mother will make her some more of those microwaved sliders with oil poured on top!  What warm and loving traditions Farrah is creating.
3937 2018-11-29 17:56:11 With the diagnosis and treatment being delivered by quacks and snake oil salesmen. Amputating a healthy leg to treat a fractured arm does not address the problem, even if the amputation is only from the knee down aka Norwegian style.
3938 2018-11-29 17:56:03 Repeated demands by Kern County Board of Elections for compliance, and documented complaints by multiple people to CADEM, are not "an issue with someone". You can deny the power of McCarthy and the oil industry in Kern, but that is what we are up against in CA23.
3939 2018-11-29 17:55:41 .@michellemungall @GeorgeHeyman Don’t let industry off the hook by implementing weak methane regulations for oil and gas. Inspections based on looking and smelling for an odourless invisible gas just don’t cut it #bcpoli

3946 2018-11-29 17:54:36 What GT needs to get in line with is a total shift away from burning fuels to renewables like wind and solar. Growing trees and corn etc. just to burn for fuel is counterproductive and should be stopped. No problem with biomass being used in the plastics industry to replace oil.

3950 2018-11-29 17:54:22 Australia’s government is suffering from the same issues that the USA and other nations are facing: oil and coal addiction.

Renewable energy needs to be much cheaper and easier to implement to take hold.

I hope they can all see the environmental and financial benefits soon.
3951 2018-11-29 17:54:22 @RachelNotley Should we be buying our oil from Saudi Arabia?- no, of course not says Notley. Not part of @cafreeland sanctions in response to SA and #Khashoggi killing.
3952 2018-11-29 17:54:08 let’s see,a RADICAL ISLAMIC, AGAINST REFORM, who works for WAPO Is killedVS OIL at 50$?..
3953 2018-11-29 17:54:04 This should be written as an opinion.  One could say that he is reacting to weak housing data, recognition of heavy corporate debt, oil falling off a cliff, strong dollar, and futures market.
3954 2018-11-29 17:53:55 Are you aware that the average price of a barrel of oil is $55 and Alberta is selling for $12... the Primary reason for that is we are forced to sell at a reduced rate because we don't have market access. Any amount of research would explain this simple concept to you.
3955 2018-11-29 17:53:55 The more I do, the worse it gets. I have started being kind to my skin, and it has thanked me. Warm rinse only in A.M., then moisturize. Shu Uema cleansing oil at night followed by Dermalogica microfollient.
3956 2018-11-29 17:53:51 Then there was that radium elixir--although that might come under that great American tradition of snake oil. Come to think of it, that's basically what Tyson is doing here, selling snake oil.
3957 2018-11-29 17:53:47 Buy more oil!!!

3963 2018-11-29 17:53:31 Obama stopped the Keystone Pipeline, stopped any oil taken from national property, Only allowed other countries to drill off our shores.  History tells another story Obama!

3967 2018-11-29 17:52:44 “I like debating.”

Cool, how do you feel on Palestine?

“Israel?”

What about climate change, pollution and the industries that cause them like meat and oil? Russia? The two parties? trump???

3970 2018-11-29 17:52:33 I think the problems are many, 
1. It doesnt rain much
2. When it does rain the roads are slick from oil
3. People drive too fast
4. Often the people who drive fast tailgate
3971 2018-11-29 17:52:28 All presidents will send our kids to die for Israel and oil wars.  I’m no trump supporter. What I find interesting is how he won and how the media/deepstate wants him out. 

Everyone is innocent until proven guilty. No evidence after 2 1/2 years should make u question it.
3972 2018-11-29 17:52:25 Well, women are always complaining that they're cold.
3973 2018-11-29 17:52:23 So now the windmill freak wants to take credit for oil that's not his game never was
3974 2018-11-29 17:52:11 Where are the tariffs on Saudi oil?
3975 2018-11-29 17:52:07 I hope your sharing that squirrel oil with the troops. Amazing stuff. This could be a business opportunity when your military career is over.

3982 2018-11-29 17:51:33 But why are we still buying their oil when we have our own? This government still sides with the Saudis over Alberta. Disgusting. Anybody's oil but Alberta no matter what they do.
3983 2018-11-29 17:51:22 “Yes, talking about motor oil here”

3985 2018-11-29 17:51:01 You are so full of shit. Don’t you know tRump keeps a lid on oil prices by abetting murder?

Drugs are already out of control. That was also due to tRump causing uncertainty about the ACA.

WE SPEND 2x AS MUCH AS THE NEXT 8 COUNTRIES ON OUR MILITARY.
3986 2018-11-29 17:50:56 can’t wait for us all to die in oil slick car accidents and mudslides!!!!!!
3987 2018-11-29 17:50:54 Also if you use coconut oil on your face, you might as well go get yo mama n em's leftover Thanksgiving Crisco from the pantry and use that. It's basically the same lol
3988 2018-11-29 17:50:50 My girl tried to give me syrup to put on my pancakes... Had to go to the garage to get the motor oil myself... 
3989 2018-11-29 17:50:50 The guy who did my oil change from oil n go found all my social media and help
3990 2018-11-29 17:50:45 @JustinTrudeau A major auto plant closure in Oshawa, an oil price crisis in Western Canada, and where are you? Oh yeah, off to the G20 summit to flaunt more global charm where the audience is less critical. Just the same as you were flying around the world last May.

3994 2018-11-29 17:50:36 One day after supporting a non-partisian approach to the Alberta energy crisis, Kenney goes after Notely for buying rail cars?
Ok Mr. I Have All The Answers, how the hell is oil going to get to tidewater without a pipeline and dismissing rail?
Asking for a friend.
3995 2018-11-29 17:50:27 Lol I'm getting an oil change. I refuse to let it put me down anymore
3996 2018-11-29 17:50:25 @BortlesFacts is it too late to try some Squirrel Oil?
3997 2018-11-29 17:50:16 Sometimes I and oftentimes I am not. I see you enjoy posting poorly crafted non-rhetorical rhetorical questions. Either way I prefer oil wresting to shower play. Plus, with oil there is always the need for a post-match shower. #ComeOnNow #ScrubScrubScrub
3998 2018-11-29 17:49:54 And it's going to be tough going for with the newly found oil
3999 2018-11-29 17:49:49 I was putting motor oil in my coffee and was so violently ill I lost 2 stone and 8 teeth

4001 2018-11-29 17:49:43 my nieces mom drank TONS of caster oil lol
4002 2018-11-29 17:49:42 The land Obama did have control over was banned from oil exploration. By who?  Yep, that was him.  Hypocritical a$$hat.
4003 2018-11-29 17:49:34 No hair oil, I’m mean pregnant people. Like I said in the post. People. Who. Get. Pregnant!
4004 2018-11-29 17:49:33 When you be going just for an oil change & everything gotta be replaced <<<>
4005 2018-11-29 17:49:20 In other words, with SA's designated National Oil and Gas company the growth will be for multi-narionals. Uyayazi lonto u Dikela masilinde, mkhuluwa

4007 2018-11-29 17:49:09 @nicolebsxo hey, what’s your outfit tonight? Any chance of oil? Xx
4008 2018-11-29 17:49:06 It’s funny, everyone up in arms over this death, but the reality is this type of stuff happens day in and day out there, but we keep using their oil because ours is “dirty”. Time for us to step up and stop importing their oil.
4009 2018-11-29 17:49:06 I already am optimistic bro. My Boss, the Boss Lady is an icon.I like her much!
4010 2018-11-29 17:48:58 Q: are organically-sourced synthetics actually better than petroleum-based? I know rayon also sheds microfibers. Once castor oil is made into plastic, isn't it still plastic?
4011 2018-11-29 17:48:50 Guy you sound sad and pained. Is everything okay? Is there palm oil in your dodo?
4012 2018-11-29 17:48:47 BTW, fats like lard and fat in many meats is actually higher in unsaturated fats than saturated fat. The highest compound in saturated fat is coconut oil (even higher than butter), but coconut oil is very good for fat loss.
4013 2018-11-29 17:48:36 Ναι στην σύμπνοια, αλλά τα εμπειρικά στοιχεία που να υποστηρίζουν τον συλλογισμό σου όσο αφορά το ΑΚΕΛ απουσιάζουν. Διαχρονικά πρώτη έγνοια το κόμμα και η ιδεολογία, μετά όλα τα άλλα.
4014 2018-11-29 17:48:35 I would rather you stopped using Palm Oil in your products. And also when you have become more ethical minded bring back the Mint Crisp and broncillie which is vegan friendly.
4015 2018-11-29 17:48:34 Even predicted by Rex Tillerson a DECADE AGO! An OIL EXEC.
4016 2018-11-29 17:48:30 It may be the way they make it at work.  One person makes it like motor oil and another makes it weak like coffee flavored water.
4017 2018-11-29 17:48:23 Fried > baked. So unless you’re dipping those triangles in pan full of oil we’re done here...hmmm. Ideas....
4018 2018-11-29 17:48:23 Buy Saudi oil still! Disgusting
4019 2018-11-29 17:48:20 I love the way you own your oil! It's so very imperial
4020 2018-11-29 17:48:20 i need my oil changed bru
4021 2018-11-29 17:48:20 I understand how you’d come to use cardboard to make the pancakes look fluffier but who tf figured out pancakes don’t absorb motor oil??
4022 2018-11-29 17:48:17 You dip the phone in hot oil 1st
4023 2018-11-29 17:48:02 CBD oil...
4024 2018-11-29 17:47:55 A gallon of Petrol has reduced from 23 cedis per gallon to 22.50 cedis 
This is partly due to the cedi's stability lately against the $ and drop in oil prices
4025 2018-11-29 17:47:53 So Notley is buying rail cars to get oil to market. I dont want to hear ANY OF YOU TRUMP HATERS complain about how he treats Saudi Arabia when our PM literally is cutting of his own countries legs to buy oil from SA instead of use our own. #cdnpoli
4026 2018-11-29 17:47:53 It's obscene that Obama is trying to take credit for oil production after all of Obama's countless regulations. Donald Trump is the only one that got us to be #1 in oil production
4027 2018-11-29 17:47:53 And oil spills get cleaned up.
4028 2018-11-29 17:47:52 The article seems dishonest to me, Chart shows the dip started before the coup of late 73, but recovery from 75. The effects of 74 oil crisis on a raw mat. economy is ignored, as well as the fixed exchange rate decision in 79 (not very Chicago inspired) leading to 82 crisis
4029 2018-11-29 17:47:47 Tax loss selling season ends late next week. Use any further weakness to add to favourite natural names. Avoid heavy oil until 2020!!
4030 2018-11-29 17:47:40 Some City fleet numbers:  6,230 oil changes completed in 2017.  That year, vehicles owned/managed by City travelled 36,715,111 kilometres. #yyccc
4031 2018-11-29 17:47:34 @AndrewScheer I work in Northern British Columbia's oil and gas sector for 20 years. I hope and pray that you and your party lead Canada to fix the catastrophic damage Trudeau's Gov't has done to my community. We support you Mr. Scheer! and have you in our prayers.
4032 2018-11-29 17:47:33 Because we've already seen that without a financial incentive (taxes), not enough is getting done. The honour system failed, so blame companies directly dependent on oil and gas for not adapting more before.

4034 2018-11-29 17:47:23 #RainOutWest SLOW DOWN. Our roads tend to pile up with oil during our drought months! It takes time for that oil to wash off. I always hear transplants from the East Coast whining that we don't know how to drive in the rain. WRONG! WE KNOW OUR OWN ROADS. You don't. Slow down.
4035 2018-11-29 17:47:16 Hey guys, listen, don't put lemon juice on your face! Or coconut oil. Tysm!
4036 2018-11-29 17:47:15 We know that nonsense they call economy is a scam, the only surviving means of those days is the high oil price that makes the politicians and their rogues spending power reckless. I will like to know any country of sensible economy without critical infrastructure
4037 2018-11-29 17:47:14 Body oil is so much better than lotion I don’t think I’ll go back it absorbs so much better

4040 2018-11-29 17:46:49 Isolate and destroy.  Oh wait, Europe is guzzling their oil and putting billions in Putz pocket.  How can the EU be so damn stupid.
4041 2018-11-29 17:46:37 Sad I look forward to that and client #3 more than la grand orange himself. Guess because they are such lackeys and snake oil peddlers. Trump is the buffoon he is.
4042 2018-11-29 17:46:30 Yess like diesel, petrol, naphtha, furnace oil etc.
4043 2018-11-29 17:46:05 Maybe this data is abt Refined oil not crude oil.
4044 2018-11-29 17:46:00 @suzukicojp @maruti_corp 
I wana know tht with which engine oil Brezza VDI come out from OEM. Since i had 3 servics & 2time change the engine oil, bt performance & mileage couldn't be matched as i felt during first 10k km.
Kindly let me know the exact engine oil brand and grade.
4045 2018-11-29 17:45:57 Nawaz never came to announce this. It was rejected despite Crude dropped to record low level. It was kind of a stunt. Since Problem Telling Institute came into power, oil prices are reduced upto 34% internationally.
4046 2018-11-29 17:45:51 omg these food advertisements that ppl call out for shaving cream & motor oil now are so funny 
4047 2018-11-29 17:45:51 god puts life first, not spirituality; good sense asks to help the less developed, to feel not frustrated, and so, us, before god. why? he gaved conditions, diversity, oil and silicon valley, boreaux vineyeards, alcohool, natural!, so on. and is us to determine how much fuel
4048 2018-11-29 17:45:39 Your head get plenty oil I swear 
4049 2018-11-29 17:45:32 The Chinese also stopped buying the FEW things they do buy from us; Soybeans, LNG, LPG  & Oil in August. The only thing left in scale is planes. It’s asymmetrical, we can’t tell Walmart to stop importing toys, but they can lock down imports overnight ( with or without a tariff)
4050 2018-11-29 17:45:28 Hwasa just randomly has truffle oil to top her instant jajangmyeon. Yup.
4051 2018-11-29 17:45:22 Je l koristio neko tea tree oil/ulje čajnog drveta/čajevca? Ja sam kupila, a ima miris ko benzin, pa da pitam da l je to normalno?

4053 2018-11-29 17:45:10 Ooooooh. Maybe they’ll start selling the RDR food too! Potent Snake Oil for $55
4054 2018-11-29 17:45:01 But it looks like Mueller just replaced the water with cooking oil.
4055 2018-11-29 17:44:58 My gma is getting me new tires and a oil change for Christmas and I’m sooo happy. Is this what being an adult is like ???
4056 2018-11-29 17:44:35 I'm low on oil and fiber, but damn my motor .... I mean my heart purrs like kitten
4057 2018-11-29 17:44:34 Thanks for this. It’s a massive change for the oil trading business. Streamlined process and adds security.
4058 2018-11-29 17:44:32 I don't think people understand how much this ring means to me. My grandpa made a living selling aguas frescas in Mexico. My dad came from Mexico to the US and is an oil field mechanic. Now, I'm graduating from Brown with a Chemical Engineering degree.
4059 2018-11-29 17:44:31 I've also heard they brush fast food burger patties with motor oil to make them look darker and juicer!
4060 2018-11-29 17:44:22 People w/ clear skin talking abt their routines: I just wake up in the morning and apply sunscreen uwu

My skin: To get rid of one(1) pimple out of the 200 on their face, applicant must slather on olive oil & chicken dance naked around a willow on a Wednesday when the moon cries
4061 2018-11-29 17:44:20 No 0bola, the production went up IN SPITE of you, not because of anything you did to help the Oil & Gas industry.
4062 2018-11-29 17:44:14 Down the road. Designer babies standard, enhanced features extra. Initially oil. Health risks aside -We don't know the genes that control advantageous traits, or even what those traits are, so Individual/ Societal ramifications are big ? Biodiversity of   at risk.
4063 2018-11-29 17:44:08 community garage, fix taillights and help people change oil (i've seen so many cheap good used cars ruined via oil starvation), when there's none of that work to be done, weld up spike strips and trauma litters
4064 2018-11-29 17:43:56 Made a blooming onion and my dad screamed at me for using a lot of oil. 
D: Can’t you fry with a little oil?!
M: DEEP FRY NGA E

Sige mag-deep fry ako, teaspoon of oil lang
4065 2018-11-29 17:43:43 Everyone is pouring oil on their faces now just to go under the sun and shout glow or “your skin can’t.”
4066 2018-11-29 17:43:39 Ugh I know :( i was gonna message you but my oil change is Saturday morning 
4067 2018-11-29 17:43:17 We should buy more oil from the Saudi empire!!
4068 2018-11-29 17:43:15 Reason why the oil is falling
4069 2018-11-29 17:43:13 Frontispiece from SIMULACRE
Alfred Reth, Hans Richter
Oil on canvas and inserted glassine overlay
4070 2018-11-29 17:43:12 What I mean is that whist Norway used their oil revenues to invest in their country they also invested cash, if you like, as a future fund. Which is why Norway will be one of the 1st countries in the world to be fossil fuel free. Uk, England, squandered it, saved none.
4071 2018-11-29 17:43:11 Economic data since the 60s shows the haven't managed that since then. Labour  has borrowed less and paid back more since 1960. Thatcher never saved for a  rainy day. Sold our oil for tax cuts....
4072 2018-11-29 17:43:09 Why are you answering a question with another question?

When 95% of your exports rely on the price of oil.. kind of hard to balance your budget when the price oil tanks

Capital accumulation still drives economic activity. 
Most enterprises are privately-owned.
4073 2018-11-29 17:43:05 If you are truly #AmericaFirst and want to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain stop importing foreign oil.  Make America energy independent! Let’s see you pull that off.
4074 2018-11-29 17:42:44 In India, If the last six weeks are taken into account, petrol and diesel prices are down by about Rs 10 and Rs 7 resp.
But in Pakistan, The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority has recommended an increase up to RS. 10 in the petroleum products.
4075 2018-11-29 17:42:42 we're like oil and water, never meant to be together
4076 2018-11-29 17:42:39 Any oil brings benefit young lad, too many mornings of aloa to sooth the burn taught me an important life lesson. The cows were able to walk again sooner as well.
4077 2018-11-29 17:42:28 Besides, they’re developing panels that have a backing made from material that doesn’t require petroleum. But I wouldn’t expect you to have known that, you thought that solar panels were legitimately made from oil in the first place 
4078 2018-11-29 17:42:26 as long as there is oil in the Middle East... we will remain there
4079 2018-11-29 17:42:22 Finally..... a 72-inch oil painting of a loon in an easy chair
4080 2018-11-29 17:42:15 So we know nothing about why this person was shot. And since we do not blame the actual shooter for the act. I guess using your logic since climate change is out of control it’s Barry’s fault since he ramped up oil production making the US the largest fossil fuel producer??
4081 2018-11-29 17:42:12 Oil and gas probably not a sector to grow. Agree with the rest.
4082 2018-11-29 17:42:03 When you purchase an XO lip oil not only are you helping your lips but you are helping a single mom trying to make life better. $1 of each oil goes to our Willing Hearts project. Thanks to you we’ve been able to bless single moms with thousands of dollars
4083 2018-11-29 17:41:50 Wow. Isn’t that telling. And yet we have the 3 rd most oil reserves in the world.
4084 2018-11-29 17:41:48 She saw Northern Gateway for what it was too... impossible, and she still gets called "anti oil" for it. Crossing multiple indigenous lands, and oil tankers out of Kitimat was never going to fly.
4085 2018-11-29 17:41:43 Move to Lanzarote.  We have 2 oil filled radiators that we use a few times a year.
4086 2018-11-29 17:41:38 that would more constructive instead of wimping and whining - do something with a plan b ... a is never going to be able to back to - world has moved on from gas cars to electric houses are built with electric so oil is needed less
4087 2018-11-29 17:41:31 I still can’t stop laughing at the most anti-oil President, Barack Obama, taking credit for the oil boom we have had. Such a failed president
4088 2018-11-29 17:41:26 There is difference.... Pakistan is religious country and we are secular.... Oil and water dont mix.....
4089 2018-11-29 17:41:14 Liberalism is about compelling, even forcing, others ppl to do things, but, not actually doing anything
4090 2018-11-29 17:41:12 Clover oil on a cotten bud .
4091 2018-11-29 17:41:10 The future is in wind and solar! Oil and gas jobs are not long term. Look to the future for clean energy sources.
4092 2018-11-29 17:41:06 They do have "leverage" although that's a poor word for it. Do you deny they are a key ally on many fronts? In addition, they could wreak havoc in the price of oil. Every President deals with bad actors for strategic reasons. Let's not pretend Trump is the first to do so.
4093 2018-11-29 17:41:05 So that means use all the oil because you use petroleum to make a plastic backing? I also said coal, not oil. I’m not surprised that you ranted on a complete tangent though, it’s been proven that conservatives don’t know how to read...
4094 2018-11-29 17:41:05 Oil>>lotion
4095 2018-11-29 17:40:45 We don’t want to be like Venezuela? Good thing we’re not solely dependent on oil exports then.
4096 2018-11-29 17:40:38 Obama hated the oil industry.  He tried to tax & regulate it out of business.  He refused to approve the pipeline. He subsidized energy alternatives.

Now he wants credit for the oil boom.

It happened bc Obama was out & Trump was in. I credit the Constitution’s term limits. 
4097 2018-11-29 17:40:29 ナルルちゃんは素直で可愛いなー。誰かさんもあれぐらい素直だったらいいんだけどなー
4098 2018-11-29 17:40:21 Interesting. Maybe not so good on palm oil?
4099 2018-11-29 17:40:17 The end won’t be some idyllic human-free eden. It’ll be something more like Venus. Venus is so bad, we don’t even send as many probes there. The solution is simple. Stop fetishizing corporations. Oil companies no more deserve to exist than mass murderers deserve to kill.

4103 2018-11-29 17:40:02 To bad it isnt true. The oil industry did well in spite of him.
4104 2018-11-29 17:39:58 Watch out for oil patterns
4105 2018-11-29 17:39:57 Anybody wanna come over and hit the sick flow from my essential oil diffuser?
4106 2018-11-29 17:39:48 If we stop funding the “war machine”, they are going to have to pony up more for security and oil. The US “war machine” subsidizes the world’s security and keeps a lid on oil prices. And if we nationalize healthcare, their drugs are going to get a helluva lot more expensive too.
4107 2018-11-29 17:39:36 Coconut oil can really be used for everything...put it everywhere....EVERYWHERE!

4111 2018-11-29 17:39:09 At #KuwaitRoadshow, Nawaf Saud Al Sabah, CEO of Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Company, remarks that technology advances have enabled global energy companies to work with local energy firms to develop oil and gas projects previously not available.

4114 2018-11-29 17:38:51 I'm sitting in the Kroger cafe while oil gets changed in my car and there are three Asian women sitting around a table studying the heck out of the Bible and discussing loudly in an Asian language. Jesus is not white folks. In any way.

4119 2018-11-29 17:38:28 Movie popcorn is better than the microwave trash, to be sure.  But the best popcorn is homemade--pour some canola oil in a pan with a lid (enough to coat the bottom of the pan), heat the canola oil for 30-45 seconds, then add a medium-dense layer of kernels (1/2)
4120 2018-11-29 17:38:22 Just like your car needs regular tune-ups and oil changes, so does your desk, chair, etc.  I have training to help, DM me for deets -50% off for a limited time!! #ergonomics #backpain
4121 2018-11-29 17:38:14 Thus they have driven a lot of  people towards trusting only in far right politics, by showing a negligence that is outrageous. It was like oil on fire.  It is sad because racism is truly not good...but we should not forget that white is also a race and needs safe living space.
4122 2018-11-29 17:38:02 Was going to do some baking using moms pantry item. The oil smell off.

Mom: Oil doesn't go bad. Use it

My response: Sorry no. The oil is either bad, or its that new Crisco flavored oil "DEATH"

4124 2018-11-29 17:37:43 Yeah. Really nice essential oil.
4125 2018-11-29 17:37:43 That’s actually a good price considering that technically it’s 2 movies + special features (most new) + restoration + artwork + poster (alone $10-25) + soaring oil prices + labor & legal all making CoG’s high. Release always high and marked down over time.

4130 2018-11-29 17:36:59 @lushcosmetics You protest the oil sands but are happy to take money from those that work in Oil and Gas. I hope every location in Alberta goes broke. I am going to tell everyone I know that you are campainging against oil and gas. #boycottlush
4131 2018-11-29 17:36:56 As far as the energy is concerned, US sanctions against Iran along with outages in Venezuela should of lead 2 supply shortages. But prices have fallen 20% in the last while. I just finished a drilling project w/lots of oil staining/florescence & 18-20 % porosity & stock went down
4132 2018-11-29 17:36:55 Our oil?? It’s UK oil and it was over inflated by the SNP before the referendum. What happened to the oil price shortly after the no vote ??

4134 2018-11-29 17:36:48 Absolutely turkey has illegally entered #syria and has Been since 2011 supporting terrorism there. During the occupation of eastern #Aleppo turkey even facilitated the extraction on industrial equipment and of course #Syrian oil.

4137 2018-11-29 17:36:33 Do you believe the Russians had been successful?  Trump slayed more than 100 Russians in Syria. The sanctions are hurting their already weak economy. Trump is smashing Iran, one of their best allies, and is doing everything to keep oil cheap which further damages Russia.
4138 2018-11-29 17:36:29 Yes oo! Anointing oil! 
4139 2018-11-29 17:36:25 Still accepting all their oil though correct?
4140 2018-11-29 17:36:20 how can you compare crude oil with the end product? there is never satisfying you guys irrespective of what happens and then you squirm when your bias is called out!

4145 2018-11-29 17:36:03 They both embrace gold b/c one would have to be dumb to sell finite oil or finite mfg output for sov debt whose volumes must be hyperinflated over next 20-30 yrs ($100-200T in US entitlements), & neither are dumb.  IMO this is why the US has labeled both nations "revisionist"

4151 2018-11-29 17:35:39 And after everything he did for eight long years to appease his “green” donors and undermine U.S. hydrocarbon production, yesterday in Houston he took credit for the recent surge in oil and gas production. “That was me,” he said. SMH

And build those pipelines so we can wean ourselves from Saudi oil
4155 2018-11-29 17:35:23 Oil I agree with 100%

Wagner unit lost? Not really seeing how that changed Russian posturing in the region given that Turkey gave in to Putin/Assad at Idlib.
4156 2018-11-29 17:35:19 @Asad_Umar @ImranKhanPTI internationally oil prices are lower, today at 60 now on OPEC. Then why gov didn't transfer this relief to all of it's sector, transportation specially diesel to tackle inflation and Electricity
4157 2018-11-29 17:35:07 We would not get anywhere near £1bn in rent - it would be a long term process part of the negotiation to get the oil- which is current the UK’s
4158 2018-11-29 17:35:05 What type of oil does India exports.. derived products!
4159 2018-11-29 17:35:02 They (main culprits) will easily get away - they have oil.

4162 2018-11-29 17:34:58 Long term the demand for oil will fall as more countries pivot towards renewable technology. Alberta is/has been critically short sighted when it comes to oil revenues.

4173 2018-11-29 17:33:48 honestly my stepmom is a nail technician so like, have a toothbrush explicitly for cleaning your nails, soak them a few minutes in sudsy water before you do, and have some tea-tree oil or coconut oil to work into the nails when ur done deep cleaning them.
4174 2018-11-29 17:33:43 Danish oil. Used a lot today.
4175 2018-11-29 17:33:43 "Data is the new oil."

It'll be used to prop up repressive oligarchs and make the world a substantially less healthy place? States that own it should worry about being invaded? Don't drink it?
4176 2018-11-29 17:33:35 Don't drive if you can avoid it! No one knows how to drive during our first rain in a year and with all of the oil on the roads! But a big WOO HOO for the rain!

4178 2018-11-29 17:33:27 Canada stopped making deals with Saudis back in the summer over another journalist who was jailed. 
Saudi sent the Canadian ambassador home and started pulling Saudi citizens out of Canada. 
The economy still ok. They sell 3 times more oil US than Saudi do.
4179 2018-11-29 17:33:23 there is an issue 

electric vehicles cause more pollution than fossil fuel cars.
nuclear power may sound clean .. but what about the spent fuel rods and contaminated water used to cool said nuke reactors.

clean energy only goes so far

also ban coal / oil fired power stations

4181 2018-11-29 17:33:09 These policies cut down on the spread of HIV, which is no longer an epidemic, while enabling addicts to go down a path that leads to poverty and death.  Trump isn’t going to save us any more than Obama did.  Big Pharma is a lot like big oil, both backed by GOP and Dems.
4182 2018-11-29 17:33:00 @realDonaldTrump #tweets are actually Tradeable! At least his view on #Crude #oil triggered a massive selloff and his massive criticism of #Fed made them change the stance. The man moves market with his Open views.

4192 2018-11-29 17:32:32 “Canada” doesn’t spend money on “foreign oil.” Private companies make transactions with suppliers on their own terms. Is it the case that “Oil Sands Action” is in favour of dramatic intervention by the government in private business? OSA reeks of fascism.
4193 2018-11-29 17:32:30 Is that the North Sea oil that’s now producing 1965 levels or the North Sea oil that Sturgeon had to inflate the figures so that she could make a case for independence?
4194 2018-11-29 17:32:27 Is it really clear? Are oil companies no longer profitable?

What right track?
4205 2018-11-29 17:31:39 Economies go updown. Prices go updown. Oil price could go over $100 when Iranian sanction bite. Production costs more than halved. Wages sensible.

4238 2018-11-29 17:29:17 This doesn't help the climate cause. Those animals are eating and expelling carbon from the short term surface cycle which is finite. The problem is burning fossil fuels from the deep long term cycle at extraordinary rates. Oil companies will love this distraction.

And no Hanukkah is not about gifts.  It is about lights and oil.  In some sense it is a policemen holiday if Sufganiyot are available. Too bad some synagogues do not serve them anymore. Yet they want protection?

4243 2018-11-29 17:28:56 Very clear that West plans for confrontation, war and conquest. Stolen oil in Iraq&Iran soon 2be completed. Russia's natural resources come next after having stolen lots in the 90s along with the oligarchs. It could of course be that Mueller is closing in on Trump ...
4244 2018-11-29 17:28:55 He's a sock puppet. Deep state trying to punish Russia with low oil prices. Trumps just the latest dancing monkey on a string to entertain/infuriate/distract us... kennedy had backbone to go after the deep state but lost his..brains.

4250 2018-11-29 17:28:34 Nothing better than a face and mouth full of burning hot oil
4251 2018-11-29 17:28:30 Does a smart oil diffuser even make sense? Unless it has reserve tanks to pull fresh oil and water from, you’d still have to get up to refill it...but I suppose that’s why you were googling it haha.

4253 2018-11-29 17:28:19 Two petrol stations next door to each other (Jet visible in the background). I wonder if either of them have survived. This must have been the 1973 oil crisis.
4254 2018-11-29 17:28:16 Reread “Zen in the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance” a few years ago. Shocked when he changes the oil in the motorcycle in an empty lot. There were other things in that old book that didn’t age well.

4256 2018-11-29 17:27:40 Because if the EU has access Scotland would have access.  Also Scotland buys more from rUK than it sells to rUK so a trade deal would be mutually beneficial.  Plus you need our oil, water etc.
4257 2018-11-29 17:27:36 Barack Obama wants to take credit for the boom in oil & gas production. 

The only thing Barack can take credit for is his support for policies that were designed to curbed fossil fuel production and destroy the oil & gas jobs of Americans.
4258 2018-11-29 17:27:34 We have a small independent oil business, Obama tried to destroy the domestic oil industry & had NOTHING to do with the technology, shale play or anything else remotely related to our business, his regulations & interference were a detriment to large & small co's!!! #LiberalLies

4278 2018-11-29 17:25:49 I agree, it’s strong based on GDP.  There are still challenges in the employment side and there is no easy fix, it’s going to be a grind this time around given the oil economy is going to struggle; we need to diversify which takes time.  JK is definitely not the transition guy.
4279 2018-11-29 17:25:49 Liberals have a problem getting paid by the Saudis but none with Paying them for oil and funding their regime. Total madness
4280 2018-11-29 17:25:45 Another note sounding our need to diversify and move away from this our oil dependent economy.
It's a death trap, emerging global trends will ensure that.
We're clearly poised to get left behind with the games our Govt is playing currently.

4289 2018-11-29 17:25:09 In as much as carrier oils are great, most of them are comedogenic and should have no business on your face. Even your fave coconut oil. That's probably why you're still breaking out. Next thread

4292 2018-11-29 17:24:53 Wars start to be shifted. Oil wars, gold wars, and now? Water wars. Perhaps, we would see human kill each other for food, and for be the last human in this planet. Natural resources, the most prospective reason to create more wars
4293 2018-11-29 17:24:51 Real estate companies in the GCC are seeking to consolidate as they emerge from a 3yr oil price slump that muted construction activity squeezing profits. Although property prices are still declining, renewed economic growth is buoying investor sentiment & re-energizing the market
4294 2018-11-29 17:24:51 You must be a fellow Californian. It’s nice to see the sky again, and to know that the toxic haze is from oil refineries and not wildfires.
4295 2018-11-29 17:24:49 Advance has more variety of paint products and brands of oil then Autozone. We don’t have O’Reillys in NYC so i can’t compare
4296 2018-11-29 17:24:47 This may be the stupidest thing I've read in 2018.  Nah.
4297 2018-11-29 17:24:46 Ironic considering your professional existence is predicated on taking money from big oil and regurgitating their talking points.
4298 2018-11-29 17:24:44 BUY AMERICAN !!!!
BMW is just name dropping 
and a 500 dollar oil change..
4299 2018-11-29 17:24:44 I bought gingerbread beard oil so I smell festive and fantastic.
4300 2018-11-29 17:24:39 @realDonaldTrump I think you should take this opportunity in Detroit and start a new industrial revolution. By developing the technology,  which many of us believe is here, to update the Postal vehicles from petroleum. Let the big oil companies pay for the switch & be part of it.
4301 2018-11-29 17:24:36 While the price of oil has decreased in the international market, the Ministry has proposed increases in oil related products. In my opinion prices will be reduced effective 1st Dec and PTI will claim credit. Showmanship thats what it's all about.
4302 2018-11-29 17:24:29 Instead of buying oil tank cars perhaps Alberta should lease cars already built. It would take a lot less time
4303 2018-11-29 17:24:27 A fry seasoning. Your fries with the dill sauce is delish, but without the dill it’s just too plain... 
oh, and for your onion chips not to be fried in the same oil as the calamari. Or maybe it’s dipped in the same batter? No clue, but it tastes fishy just the same 
4304 2018-11-29 17:24:25 And oil is likely to go up.
4305 2018-11-29 17:24:25 But but but....oil......
4306 2018-11-29 17:24:15 ...but I wonder whether there was also a "Dutch disease" effect in the shrinking of manufacturing due to North Sea oil (which peaked around 2000) and the financial services bubble which burst in the 2007/8 GFC.
4307 2018-11-29 17:24:08 Lead and others will follow. America needs to do it’s part.  Let’s focus on what we can control not using other countries as a scape goat to avoid taking responsibility.  Cut back on your meat consumption and palm oil use and vote pro-environment. Then let’s help India and China
4308 2018-11-29 17:24:08 We won 100L free furnace oil to give away as we don't use furnace oil.  It is the scratch coupon we got from Maritimes Fuels.  Anybody wanting this coupon would have to pick it up and then go online and enter the winning code.

4319 2018-11-29 17:23:13 but Abby what’s the best essential oil to cure my breast cancer,,, any tips????
4320 2018-11-29 17:23:12 Well this will help move the oil however, based on previous policies you enacted we are in this position. Its all fine to act when your job is on the line. Partisanship has no place in the economies of our province. Just doesn't work.
4321 2018-11-29 17:23:11 We were selling our oil to third world Countries and buying Saudi oil for US consumers.
4322 2018-11-29 17:22:58 Oil is more valuable than human life.
4323 2018-11-29 17:22:50 Keep cancelling it with Putin. Putin doing an oil deal with Middle East!
4324 2018-11-29 17:22:40 You’re not a geologist nor a petroleum engineer, otherwise you would rethink. We’ve been searching for oil in the north for 40 years. It’s about time to stop this wastage. The geological basins aren’t conducive for hydrocarbon accumulation IMO. If it is sell the licenses to OCs.
4325 2018-11-29 17:22:40 No, oil vapour lines
4326 2018-11-29 17:22:31 Our liberal "fact checking" cartel is dead silent on Obama's claim he is responsible for the oil production boom.
4327 2018-11-29 17:22:30 I know.  £8bn a year from oil.  Using the £1 sterling.  But the best one was have a fully up and running iScotland in 18mths for just £200m.

They are still asking WM to hold onto welfare powers because they aren't ready yet.  The one dept alone is costing £1bn.
4328 2018-11-29 17:22:18 Former president of Shell Oil Company John Hofmeister said former President Barack Obama had nothing to do with America’s increased oil production and actually frustrated many areas of the energy sector.
4329 2018-11-29 17:22:16 Minimum qualification is O level. Beneficiaries are from the 13 "oil districts." Application deadline Jan 2019. Pick application  forms from District Education Officers at the respective districts

4333 2018-11-29 17:21:56 Isn’t this the guy who let massive amounts of oil leak into the Gulf of Mexico?
4334 2018-11-29 17:21:46 I thought squirrel oil was on the banned substance list. Very shady
4335 2018-11-29 17:21:45 stop using palm oil
4336 2018-11-29 17:21:42 JL took a giant position in $bte today. Oil is going up!
4337 2018-11-29 17:21:39 almost every tweet involving pics of pancakes is bombarded with comments about there being the cardboard and motor oil used...love it
4338 2018-11-29 17:21:35 Our fuels are not affected by Saudi Arabia. The juggling of the world price per barrel is what affects our pricing. The Saudi’s and the oil nations maintain and set oil pricing with the world. 

Western nations, with the exception of US, have put the screws to MBS,not US/KUSHNER
4339 2018-11-29 17:21:31 Step 1: Less Meat.  Step 2: Less Palm Oil
4340 2018-11-29 17:21:24 Of course Cruz is on there... Piece of sh....

4342 2018-11-29 17:21:00 The only thing worse than denial of anthropogenic climate change is being an outright crackpot who chugs snake oil for a living proclaiming it’s actually “beneficial!/a good thing!”, which is wholly incorrect in just about every vector imaginable and puts my jaw underground.
4343 2018-11-29 17:20:57 Shooting szn 

Damn

One night I was sleep shooting a recipe video on my 9th or so 

Everyone was choking on bleached oil mans was on auto pilot making ofada

Videographer: Aunty you be zombie 
4344 2018-11-29 17:20:56 I know I don’t know what’s happened this year but it’s the worst yet. It doesn’t help as I am recovering from foot surgery so he’s unsettled anyway. Adam on here has given me great advice and I have given him some CBD oil in his food as well. Btw your dogs are beautiful 
4345 2018-11-29 17:20:53 The only thing worse than denial of anthropogenic climate change is being an outright crackpot who chugs snake oil for a living proclaiming it’s actually “beneficial!/a good thing!”, which is wholly incorrect in just about every vector imaginable and puts my jaw underground.
4346 2018-11-29 17:20:51 Nope! Not going to do it. Thank you President Trump @realDonaldTrump for our booming economy, stock, market growth, jobs and oil production. I understand what makes an economy grow and was not Obama’s excessive spending plan.

4349 2018-11-29 17:20:28 Sure thing I will bring the baby oil
4350 2018-11-29 17:20:28 Still plan on a Middle East war to allow Russia to capture a large portion of Iraq's oil reserves. See 1-21-2017 CIA speech.
4351 2018-11-29 17:20:22 Reduce your meat consumption.  Skip the exotic fruits and veggies.  Steer clear of Palm Oil products like PepsiCo stuff.  Walk if you can or ride a bike or bus sometimes.  Vote for people who want to save the planet!! Use less plastic.  Train over Plain if possible.  Let’s do it!
4352 2018-11-29 17:20:19 Why are you still buying oil from them?
Oh that’s right, money talks. Hypocrite!!
4353 2018-11-29 17:20:10 Very interested to hear the arguments in support. 

I'm guessing it'll just be, "do we really want to pay more for oil"
4354 2018-11-29 17:20:10 I'm Oil Can Harry! And I'm Sour puss!

4357 2018-11-29 17:19:51 Forget about the followers and face the topic. 

Which do you want to dispute? 

The revenue from 2010-2014 being out highest ever? 
Our economy solely dependent on oil?
That our thriving economy crashed with oil prices?
Or that we didn't build?

Which?
4358 2018-11-29 17:19:42 Someone doesn't want to pay Trump's lawyers legal fee's. Seems her blackmail deal for $130,000 with Trump was more honorable than the Democrat Snake Oil Sales man Mike.
4359 2018-11-29 17:19:42 WES you are the king !!!! Your the oil king, I'm the Prince,. Much to learn from you
4360 2018-11-29 17:19:42 Decide tomorrow. It'll be Daisy.
4361 2018-11-29 17:19:38 The price of oil was high during his time in office.  That is what drove development of new sources.  While he was certainly responsible for those higher prices, the result was not what he intended.
4362 2018-11-29 17:19:37 Get this ‘Curls’ product from target called curl jell in a tall bottle works like a MF!!!! I had the same problem add a little oil with it
4363 2018-11-29 17:19:36 @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews @andersoncooper @CNN oil prices low. Taxes low . More jobs than you can fill. Record  low unemployment.  Thanks to @realDonaldTrump and @BarackObama did not Build That....
4364 2018-11-29 17:19:32 If you're going to be storing a car for the winter, take a few steps to make life easier when you get it back out:

Change the oil- used oil may damage the engine
Top off the gas tank
Keep it charged- Start the car every two weeks for 15 minutes to keep the battery alive.
4365 2018-11-29 17:19:29 Please drive safe everyone, it’s wet. All the oil & garbage makes it’s a slippery surface.
4366 2018-11-29 17:19:27 If we would have taken the oil, you wouldn't have ISIS.
4367 2018-11-29 17:19:26 Seriously sanctions on the alleged killers. Oh my that is tough measures....NOT! They are in prison, facing the death penalty. Probably so truth never found out maybe murderd ahead of time! Stop the Arms and the oil! That is how to sanction a country of human right violators
4368 2018-11-29 17:19:24 Ernest Hemingway joined my commute this morning:

We stopped for a donut and it was a bad donut. The donut cook had not changed the oil and the donut had a bad taste. I ate half of the bad donut and then I threw the other half in the trash. It cost ninety cents.
4369 2018-11-29 17:19:14 It's worse. At least Mr Gore didn't try to ban offshore internets. Oil & gas grew *despite* things Obama did.
4370 2018-11-29 17:19:12 ما في شي مضحك 
بالعكس شي مقزز
4371 2018-11-29 17:19:10 I believe the point was America’s Being the largest producer of oil not gas prices....in which case Obama is incorrect.
4372 2018-11-29 17:19:02 why do stores make shopping for girls so easy but try to look for a stocking stuffer for a guy? ummm a toothbrush? some body wash? uhh fukin motor oil? ion know
4373 2018-11-29 17:18:59 WTI oil at $51.13/barrel, +$0.85.

4375 2018-11-29 17:18:53 I use the body shop tea tree oil clearing clay mask. I had so many dark spots because of acne but I'm telling you, you can feel your face glowing after wearing it. 2 times per week A HOLY GRAIL
4376 2018-11-29 17:18:53 Snow blower maintenance done! Let it snow! Oil changed, new spark plug, linkage adjusted & lubed ready to go!
4377 2018-11-29 17:18:52 Regret? At this point it’s about the only fun part of this we get to anticipate.
4378 2018-11-29 17:18:51 The squirrel oil is finally back
4379 2018-11-29 17:18:50 @BarackObama Former president of Shell Oil Company John Hofmeister said former President Barack Obama had nothing to do with America’s increased oil production and actually frustrated many areas of the energy sector.
4380 2018-11-29 17:18:40 Everyone wants to be a comedian. Shutting down oil companies through regulation does not produce more oil. Wind farms and solar energy does not produce more oil. Not saying other energy sources are bad. Just that Obama was trying to shut it all down.
4381 2018-11-29 17:18:38 not sure how face oil works for oily skin
4382 2018-11-29 17:18:35 I want so many dog books 
But I'm broke. I need to do a lot of oil changes. Anyone need work done on their vehicle ?
4383 2018-11-29 17:18:33 Those who would give up essential Dionysus, to purchase a little temporary Chili oil, deserve neither Mobile TV nor Taut-line hitch.
4384 2018-11-29 17:18:30 By the way, we guarantee that the sailors will not be chopped up for stuffing by our special services. Like that journalist Jamal Khashoggi. But you will not have to be humiliated and ask Russia for a better price for oil.

4387 2018-11-29 17:18:13 Before this becomes a part of recorded history, I’d like to point out that LA natives drive in the rain just fine; it’s the transplants that try to take an oil slick at either 80 or 8 mph
4388 2018-11-29 17:18:05 I'll never look at any food advertisements the same after seeing that video where they put carboard in between the pancakes and used motor oil for syrup. If pancakes aren't sacred, NOTHING is safe. NOTHING

4390 2018-11-29 17:17:51 it’s just my gut feeling Bhutan should not touch her forest reserve; for example America/Canada is sitting on a huge oil reserves and they are not harvesting it; every country likes to preserve their natural resources instead of prostituting it~ maybe I am too old fashioned

4393 2018-11-29 17:17:33 If you’re going that route go for Full Spectrum CBD oil from a reputable source. It’s strong af and it’ll work but it’s probably not something you should rely on forever

4396 2018-11-29 17:17:19 Why aren't reporters calling them out? Because mainstream media sucks, that's why. Because mainstream media is working FOR large corporate interests, such as the oil companies, the gas companies, the "defense" industry, big Ag, etc. all of which contribute to greenhouse emissions
4397 2018-11-29 17:17:18 I have a problem with the notion that the rest of Canada ignores Albertas plight. The liberal government just spent 4 or 5 Billion $$ buying Trans Mountain so the oil can get to the coast. That's money from all Canadian taxpayers. Not their fault that BC is blocking Alberta's oil

4401 2018-11-29 17:16:53 @Scottymechanic Love your videos. I bought a 2006 Honda Ridgeline with 100,000 miles and I put another 100,000 on it before it began burning a LOT of oil. Do you know what Honda did wrong with the number 4 cylinder on these V6s?
4402 2018-11-29 17:16:47 Toot needs all new tires, a new mirror, a new window shield, a oil change, she has a oil leak & I’ma need new brakes soon.  before I get of this shit fixed I’m buying a new car.
4403 2018-11-29 17:16:36 i put eucalyptus oil in my bong a few times
4404 2018-11-29 17:16:36 Those who oppose corporate welfare on one hand, demand corporate welfare for the projects they like. E.g. electric cars.  When oil returns to the $100 area, the MARKET will kick the next impulse move of electric innovation, just as the tipping point was hit in the run up to 2007.

4415 2018-11-29 17:16:06 Mr. Obama has a lot of damn gall to make that statement. He did everything in his power to thwart oil production in the US.
4416 2018-11-29 17:16:05 Wow...what an absolute liar...trying to re-write his presidency that’s being taken apart and reversed piece by piece. He’s an absolute liar. He did all he could to STOP American production of coal, oil, and gas, giving handouts to now failed solar energy companies. Short memory!

Claim that guy.  Claim the everloving crap out of him.

4428 2018-11-29 17:14:30 The ultimate con man knows his mark. This is Trump’s only skill. He knows the buzz words and whistles that make them heel.Real Estate and Oil are two areas we should never pull politicans from, yet the GOP has repeatedly done so. They are both rife with corruption and immorality.
4429 2018-11-29 17:14:21 A recent study found that a diet high in soybean oil causes more obesity and diabetes than a diet high in fructose. #ChippingCampden
4430 2018-11-29 17:14:11 Yes, Mr. Leach routinely looks down his nose on us poor oil patch workers.  He doesn’t live in the real world.

4432 2018-11-29 17:13:54 Girl is you me? Minus the mayo.. I get chipotle. With a dash of oil.
4433 2018-11-29 17:13:51 Who controls the OIL controls everything.
4434 2018-11-29 17:13:48 shit take mine. $80 oil changes. 1500 power steering unit. $1000 tires. and sports car classification so ya insurance a little high. and not family friendly.
4435 2018-11-29 17:13:48 Ouch!!! Never had that. Well I've been oil marked. What happened?
4436 2018-11-29 17:13:45 add oil!!  we always fnc!!!!
4437 2018-11-29 17:13:39 idk if y’all need to know this or not, but mcdonald’s cooks there sausage on the flat top. burger king sticks that shit right in the oil. same oil they use to fry fries. i’m procrastinating studying by telling you useless facts about fast food sausage.
4438 2018-11-29 17:13:34 To answer your question I would say yes, oil wresting is sexier. #1 Easier to lay down #2 Better lube
4439 2018-11-29 17:13:23 When you take a really good look at Obama, the Clintons, Pelosi et al, how is the democrat party surviving? They are all talk and no good decision making. Obama tries to take credit for the US being # 1 in oil production wheh it got there in spite of all the pitfalls he put in.
4440 2018-11-29 17:13:16 ... Or it was a supply side shock caused by the oil crisis that was handled by the 1975 EPCA and the 1978 Natural Gas Policy Act.

The tone of inflation hawks is high handed. Rational, objective people can disagree about appropriate targets, but moralizing is bad public policy.

4443 2018-11-29 17:13:06 Right now it’s Organo Black coffee, 1 tsp MCT oil and a scoop of collagen Peptide Powder-blended. I would like to replace the Organo with Perk!
4444 2018-11-29 17:12:55 We too are very concerned about the use of unsustainably sourced palm oil and the negative effect that it has on the environment & animal welfare. We collectively decided to completely remove it from our soups earlier this year and it has since been replaced with sunflower oil.
4445 2018-11-29 17:12:52 Snake oil salesmen of our time.

1) Sell fear
2) Promise to alleviate those fears
3) Guarantee you're the only one who can do so
4) Magic formula is in my pocket
5) And just happens to be for sale
6) No, I don't have a physical address or refund policy, fuck off.
4446 2018-11-29 17:12:51 you can pour it with like a spoon or lid or plate against the pot to stop the noodles from falling & u can try different methods to make it next time if you have an oven you can soak the pasta in like olive oil & then bake it in sauce & itll cook that way
4447 2018-11-29 17:12:48 i miss having someone around during instances like rn, here i am just sitting here by my lonely getting this oil changed

4454 2018-11-29 17:12:03 Should include high-speed rail across the country, and mass transit subways/light-rail in the medium range, and EV buses/streetcars for neighborhood transport. This will cut down on oil use.
4455 2018-11-29 17:12:01 You and DIY just don’t mix ... Oil & Water
4456 2018-11-29 17:12:00 Yes we would go happily and take our, oil, whisky, shipbuilding, fishing and farming with us, while you go bankrupt trying to find somewhere to put Trident. 
This affects us and we will have our day.
4457 2018-11-29 17:11:54 Umm.. weren’t you President when a bucket of KFC cost more than a barrel of oil? Could have swore that was you I seen in the White House.
4458 2018-11-29 17:11:45 I liked your report about canola oil, what I don't understand is the fact that you seem to be unaware that we are metric and I wonder why you don't use Celsius instead of Fahrenheit in this article ?It is for many people a sign from a bygone age.( As in the US)
4459 2018-11-29 17:11:41 Hi there, we did use sustainably sourced R.S.P.O. certified palm oil in some of our Avonmore soup recipes up until the beginning of 2018. It was part of a compound ingredient supplied to us and it equated to 0.01% of the overall recipes where it was used.

100,000 oil workers or 2,500 auto workers???

How much has the auto industry paid in royalties to Ottawa?

Be honest, which industry is a priority for your government?
4465 2018-11-29 17:11:05 @stephenharper Good day Mr Harper. Consider running for PM again? probably not, but would like to see an appointee with same values, goals, and someone who can restore our economic power (oil/gas/mining) scrap carbon tax, get our F-35's!

4475 2018-11-29 17:10:14 Fellow Albertans, when you go to vote in 2019, remember the oil price "differential" crisis was preceded by Notley's pipeline "deferential" crisis.

Letting Trudeau lead us to inertia, or worse, now has direct & potentially dire consequences for #Alberta.

4476 2018-11-29 17:10:10 The two industries that keep taking us on a roller coaster ride are oil and real estate speculation. #up&down #since1913
4477 2018-11-29 17:10:10 Its an inherently unpredictable and flawed theocracy, but we hav interests there. no, the interests arent just trumps hotels; stabilizing  oil prices and keeping a check on Iranian and Russian influence in the region serves benefits the west. These things happen w or w/out us.
4478 2018-11-29 17:10:06 The study you posted was an assessment of methane emissions from the US oil/gas industries. How does it demonstrate that, globally (not just in the US, where neither of us live), livestock production is not in fact the most significant anthropogenic source of CH4?

4481 2018-11-29 17:09:43 Rosehip is good 4 oily skin mix it with Tea Tree Oil if u have acne. Grape Seed/Avocodo is better for dry & sensitive. Marula & Maracauja are good 4 normal. Coconut is only 4 ur hair never your face. Jojoba is good on top of makeup & helps with under eye creasing w/ mature skin.
4482 2018-11-29 17:09:39 thankfully not myself! but uhhhh the desk, the floor, the white tile underneath the burette, the bit of counter right next to the sink
i did spill the oil on myself tho! labcoat saved my clothes thank god
4483 2018-11-29 17:09:37 If you put citrus oil or orange scraps at the base of your tree it will keep them away! Or at least that’s what has worked for my cat and my aunts cats so far!

4489 2018-11-29 17:08:53 Then why are we still in the middle east? We also have an interest in oil! Trump wanted to steal all of Iraqs oil and stated that the Iraqi war is only for oil. If you want, I can send you that article.  I have to leave here now.

4505 2018-11-29 17:07:36 What the centre suppose to do ?you have get in place.Cut the sales tax on oil
4506 2018-11-29 17:07:31 Wanna bet, what international company is spending money in Canadian Oil, that’s right no one.
4507 2018-11-29 17:07:26 It's been a while since I've been to  a movie theatre. Have they returned to real butter, at least as an option, or is still that pathetic palm oil crap?
4508 2018-11-29 17:07:23 That approach becomes particularly attractive if you can use CO2 from DAC for EOR or EGR and inject more CO2 than the C content of the oil/gas you bring up, resulting in slightly carbon negative fossil fuels.
4509 2018-11-29 17:07:21 Oil prices began to rally on Thursday as news emerged that Russia had accepted the need to cut production, together with OPEC.

4512 2018-11-29 17:07:00 I didn't get mad when they stopped selling ARs but when they started donating big money to gun control pacs, I stopped giving them any of my money.
4513 2018-11-29 17:06:59 Do you have the oil price structure? How much tax is levied on crude oil ? How much is centre’s share and how much is State’s share ?
4514 2018-11-29 17:06:53 But to seriously answer your question a book by Dr. Bruce fife on coconu my oil and it benefits did have a massive influence
4515 2018-11-29 17:06:50 Jou Oil Painting is Awesome! 
4516 2018-11-29 17:06:37 Yes i agree with you, but i find it pathetic that you expect Notley's 4 years gov't to achieve what your couldn't in 44 years. In 44 years you couldn't ensure that we get good price for our oil. Makes me wonder if cons were in Texas lobby's pocket.
4517 2018-11-29 17:06:31 Go Pro lenses-Drone optics-Tablets-all need regular #opticalcleaning to maintain pristine conditions for optimum imaging. Nothing better than #ROR to do the job-- the only Residual Oil Remover that gets that grimy residue off lens surfaces --the difference is "CLEAR"!!!
4518 2018-11-29 17:06:27 25% of Americans' diet????
Puhlease, Americans' biggest source of veggies is ketchup, and that only contains about 5% tomato.
4519 2018-11-29 17:06:26 Average of last15 days crude price is taken for computing today petrol price. Therefore there is time leg in today price of crude and petrol. Some time it is reverse as well. Therefore there is leg. You are a novice in business. Oil companies keep 15 days inventory for refining.
4520 2018-11-29 17:06:24 Yet, we can’t run advertising that tells people to boycott Saudi oil... 
4521 2018-11-29 17:06:22 ふふふ
4522 2018-11-29 17:06:05 Culling efforts, mercifully, are back in place. Shooting works best -- oil on the eggs damages too many other species. Cormorants eat a quarter of their body weight a day in fish. Splurged when alewives were plentiful. Exploded in population. Just about wiped out Les Cheneaux.
4523 2018-11-29 17:05:53 Yet you all keep dealing with Saudi just because of oil, Canada has to stop selling arms to this regime, one day the government will be found guilty for the millions dying in Yemen
4524 2018-11-29 17:05:51 linn energy did not survive the Obama oil policies
4525 2018-11-29 17:05:50 I'm only taking them there to feed them straight oil to shut them up. I love them but they would benefit from oil in their mouths

4530 2018-11-29 17:05:41 Obama blocked any possible increase of oil production on federal lands. The increase was all on private land. He also restricted production in the gulf. My God, the narcissism!!

4537 2018-11-29 17:05:09 Dear @RachelNotley 

If you are "essentially giving away our oil for free", why are you STILL pumping it out?

Stop until prices go up and pipeline capacity to tidewater increases.

Create a program to support financially workers out of job and retrain them for new work.

#ABpoli
4538 2018-11-29 17:04:56 How do you check your oil to determine if it's still good?
4539 2018-11-29 17:04:55 I call on my fellow Americans to educate themselves on what the USA is doing to support the Saudis in their criminal GENOCIDE of those living in Yemen!  OIL IS NOT WORTH IT...WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR MORAL COMPASS?
4540 2018-11-29 17:04:48 what facts - you didn’t even know that world oil prices impact Alberta.  What cabbage leaf did you crawl out from under?
4541 2018-11-29 17:04:47 Get ur Oil Changed at Wal-Mart. You won’t see any New trucks there.
4542 2018-11-29 17:04:39 Came in to get an oil change and they totally called me out on the fact that I’m 10,000 miles overdue. Like repetitively telling me I will ruin my engine. 
4543 2018-11-29 17:04:37 What did you type that reply on? Without oil and gas that phone or computer doesn't exist you dimwit. People need to think before they act. Unless you're willing to go back to writing letters, you need oil. What are YOU doing to help the environment? Tweeting about it is nothing.
4544 2018-11-29 17:04:37 @Asad_Umar you need to take quick action about furnace oil of refineries. They are operating below par due to storage limitations.
4545 2018-11-29 17:04:33 Sana oil hahaha
4546 2018-11-29 17:04:33 PALM OIL!!!! No thank you!
4547 2018-11-29 17:04:22 Let's see...  Obama blocked offshore drilling, was against fracking, was against drilling in Alaska, yet this insane narcissist is taking credit for America being the largest oil producer? The only people who believe this are the lemmings planted up this failure's ass.

Hope you can understand below formula easily and delete your old tweet and tweet new data.
Old rate+processing cost+ taxes and charges= 100, then new prices will be 100-(0.7 oil rate)when 30% lower crude rate
4552 2018-11-29 17:03:27 Shameful! What the charts reflect regarding oil production during Obama years is in spite of his administration not because of it..and he knows it. By coincidence shale oil production had just begun when he came into office and increased every year. What a liar..what a fake he is

4555 2018-11-29 17:03:01 Maybe it's that because it's usually so dry, oil has more time to accumulate so that when it does rain, everything gets slippier. But it is mostly the *roads*, only partly the drivers, that makes it so crazy.

4560 2018-11-29 17:02:27 They're all either in his cabinet or an advisor of his, or someone working directly for him. After claiming he hires the best people. He's a joke bro. Who puts an oil CEO in charge of the environment? Who puts someone as stupid as Betsy in charge of education? Hires the best ppl?
4561 2018-11-29 17:02:26 Mrs. Tyree's Freshman science class conducted an experiment on  "Fractional Distillation"!  The students were able to successfully separate water, carbon dioxide and ester from grape soda.  This is relatable to separating components in crude oil to more usable forms.
4562 2018-11-29 17:02:23 Hi Karrie, we ONLY use sustainable palm oil, and there is limited space on our packaging, otherwise we would print it on every product. Thanks for sharing your thoughts on this - Jake

4565 2018-11-29 17:02:05 It wasn’t that he felt nothing. But it was as if someone finding a house engulfed in flames had thrown oil onto the fire: the flames might have burned a little hotter, but in the end it made little difference. The house was coming down. #Thurds #AnimusLittleGods
4566 2018-11-29 17:02:03 Its 5th day today after filling Castrol Magnetic in my Suzuki Brezza VDI (O), now i am on conclusion that this engine oil not only reduced the mileage per kmpl even in top gears 4th &5th, m feeling poor acceleration. Pls help me out. No one contacted me since you asked my number.
4567 2018-11-29 17:01:59 Well, guess I’ll never buy anything from Lush Cosmetics ever again. I wish people realized how important the oil industry is for the economy in Canada #disappointed
4568 2018-11-29 17:01:54 i really need to get a new bottle of emu oil bc i've had my 3/4" tunnels ready for like a year now but my ears just keep saying they aren't ready so i need to pamper the hell out of them so i can get there

4570 2018-11-29 17:01:38 Thx again for the reply. Good to hear you are so popular. I only decided to try soap in order to cut down on plastic so, if others feel the same, prepare for a deluge! Esp as it’s not easy to find soap with such natural ingredients and no palm oil.... 1/2

4572 2018-11-29 17:01:25 For many years TEXAS has wanted Independence from The USA. One ability they have is they can produce "Oil". If The US Government and Military allowed the "Non-Fossil Fuel" reality to be known as they could have 70 years ago

4574 2018-11-29 17:01:12 As long as you a) keep following the Israeli divide and rule strategy for the Arab world, b) keep making a buck with your arms sales to KSA and c) ensuring the Saudis keep the price of oil low so your ponzi scheme doesnt collapse you bastards will keep spouting this bullshit.
4575 2018-11-29 17:01:05 Already Daily it is passed on  since october 16. You can not compare crude price and petrol price like u are doing. You don't know basics of business first learn then speak. you are novice. Oil companies keep inventory for 15 days.Therefore average of15 days crude price is taken.
4576 2018-11-29 17:01:01 My dog and I return home and I go to the kitchen to pop some of my #traderjoes salmon oil pills. It’s time to get ready for work.
4577 2018-11-29 17:00:54 I’m paying $2.89 gal. so I’d prefer to pay $2.62 gal. lol. We have enough oil between the U.S. and Canada we don’t need the Saudis. America is used to cheap oil while other countries pay over $10 per gallon. We need to stop using fossil fuels and start going to renewables.

4581 2018-11-29 17:00:45 Don't believe. Read the study I've posted. CH4 levels in the atmosphere have been rising although according to calculations, methane levels should be balanced. Why? Because the methane leaks from gas/oil supply have been neglected. If you want your devil, look there.
4582 2018-11-29 17:00:41 It's potato pancakes. We make them during Hanukkah because they are fried in oil and the oil represents the oil in the lamp that lasted 8 nights.
4583 2018-11-29 17:00:33 I'm big into oil. I own lots of it and I know what it smells like. It's rich smelling. The smell itself spawns property and mansions.

4590 2018-11-29 17:00:14 Here we go again - blame Trudeau! Well, it ain't going to work anymore @AndrewScheer. The oil producers are the ones to blame, and now we all have to help Alberta get out of this mess - as we should. But, as I have already said, the finger-pointing has to stop: governments and...

4592 2018-11-29 16:59:53 if you're actively stretching them i would recommend at least once daily for 5-10 mins! the oil is an excellent and healthy lubricant for getting new jewelry in as well
4593 2018-11-29 16:59:43 In LA it's a quarter inch of oil and rubber that gets floated off the blacktop by the rain. And the fun of Angelenos digging in the glove box to find the manual that explains what wipers are, what they do, and how to turn them on.
4594 2018-11-29 16:59:36 And I can tell you haven’t got a clue about the oil industry...been in it for over 35 years now (engineering; that’s right...I have access to the actual logs) So, I don’t think there’s much that you’ll teach me Harald!
4595 2018-11-29 16:59:23 Here's another idea: stop selling high GHG oil because A) it's killing the planet faster than lower GHG oil and B) the "profits" are going to be eaten up by environment remediations which are  underfunded now and soon 2b unfunded in the impending collapse of the oilsands
4596 2018-11-29 16:59:05 Ladies! Don't be that person... Cleanse, Gently Exfoliate, Mask, Spot Treat, Rose Oil, Moisturize, Eye Cream & take your Azz to bed, like a normal person!!! #TheView
4597 2018-11-29 16:58:59 Snake oil folks dont fall for it yet another narrative designed to cause division & deflect
4598 2018-11-29 16:58:57 You mean like the oil industry stands on its own? Except of course for the pipelines, rail cars, etc. At least solar brings environmental benefits as well as economic ones.
4599 2018-11-29 16:58:55 You stuck to your movies business don't learn the economics of oil pricing.
4600 2018-11-29 16:58:44 Kyle don’t be an ass, no need to be rude, you have an opinion, as do I, doesn’t make you a loser because you don’t think the way I do. You might just be, but I won’t judge you on how you view or cheer for a sports team.
4601 2018-11-29 16:58:42 imma slather some motor oil on it
4602 2018-11-29 16:58:34 Mr President reduce your debt on permanent and monthly basis.Increase oil production and become major exporter.
4603 2018-11-29 16:58:32 So the Saudis will now buy their arms and vehicles from the US and Russia while they continue to ship their oil tankers up the St Lawrence. They are probably okay with that.
4604 2018-11-29 16:58:19 Slept on my nose ring & then pulled it in the shower this morning, it’s so irritated & I wanna cry. I already cleaned it with sea salt & applied tree tea oil
4605 2018-11-29 16:58:16 Once again customers scammed at the #petrolpump as oil prices drop significantly. Petrol relistic price should be between £1.00 and £1.10 per litre. In UK

4607 2018-11-29 16:58:07 By most accounts, Venezuela with its oil richness was not a shit hole until the current gov't got "elected" and nationalized all private businesses.  Then followed up with making private firearm ownership illegal, armed a militia to control them and the rest is well-known.
4608 2018-11-29 16:58:03 i have cut back on butter, i had always used it profusely, like at paula deen levels. i don't know how rich in calcium it is, but i had to be getting some, right??
maybe not, idk. i did break a lot of bones...

4621 2018-11-29 16:57:22 Aside from being full of crap, Obama contradicts himself: claims to be a climate change policy hero with anti-fossil fuel policies, while claiming credit for strong growth in the U.S. oil/fossil fuel industry. The more the leftwing losers spew, the more they embarrass themselves.
4622 2018-11-29 16:57:22 @andersoncooper @CNN  “ I’m not a scientist but...” should  disqualify anyone from contributing op on climate change. Scientists & experts must be heard & respected.  Full disclosure of ties to big oil interests is crucial. Leave talking from the gut to Trump & @StephenAtHome 
4623 2018-11-29 16:57:21 The pricing depends on downstream costs such as transportation, refining costs etc. As you can see oil prices have a downward effect on fuel prices but it’s not perfectly correlated.
4624 2018-11-29 16:57:19 Surely the act of "boiling your own head in oil" would actually be deep frying it.
4625 2018-11-29 16:57:10 Forget about the #nationalanthem and the #NFL. If Colin Kaepernick had murdered a newspaper journalist (or, you know, made war on the people of Yemen), we'd still sell him weapons of mass destruction if he had enough money and oil. @Kaepernick7 #JamalKhashoggi @realDonaldTrump

4628 2018-11-29 16:56:52 the 9/11 planes were holograms! Thomas Jefferson owned slaves, a philosopher stone, and an iMac! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
4629 2018-11-29 16:56:52 Just so I'm understanding this correctly - are you saying Dinosaurs were fake, or the idea that fossils from extremely old organisms turning into oil is fake? Serious question.

4635 2018-11-29 16:56:26 Thought so (but I am diabetic anyway so have to choose no/low sugar versions as well as having no Palm Oil).
4636 2018-11-29 16:56:25 Again me and my friend did jobs. I had like 100 bucks as soon as we were done. Got like 60-70 now from buying gun oil, food, bullets. Gonna start saving for guns since they are hella expensive.
4637 2018-11-29 16:56:17 Just think.. would not need to pave the Earth, maintain Bridges, no airports... No taxes..
No electric or gas bills...
No drilling for oil.. 
No dangerous radiation from power plants..
Clean water, clean air..
4638 2018-11-29 16:56:08 Then you should know that most geologists are Lefties. They don’t have a positive eye on oil and gas industry.
4639 2018-11-29 16:56:04 My children are getting pasta.... with olive oil and salt...... as the weather was too grim to go to the store! Deserts could be 5 week old meringues!!! As Judy found at back or cupboard....
4640 2018-11-29 16:55:50 you just continue to spin and cherry pick your facts.  Trudeau does not set the price of oil .  Trudeau does not control American auto manufacturing.  you should maybe take a journalist course.  learn how to be a real journalist. or just join Ontario now fake news .

4647 2018-11-29 16:55:03 Learning is conjecture and refutation. Copying knowledge like that is impossible. It would be like poring oil in water: they don’t mix.
4648 2018-11-29 16:55:02 Obama was hostile to the fossil fuel industry.  Oil production did rise under his watch but not by anything he did to help it. High oil prices and fracking led to the increases.

4653 2018-11-29 16:54:42 @BarackObama is a LIAR it was NOT him. He strangled our oil and gas production. His memory is wrong.
4654 2018-11-29 16:54:37 I guess we don’t need oil from Russia!
4655 2018-11-29 16:54:37 @HondaofLisle I want everyone to be informed this dealership is racist. I went in for service, their mechanic spilled oil on my exhaust and caused a toxic smell coming threw the vents in my car which my daughter inhaled who has asthma. Don’t buy their cars or use their service.

4663 2018-11-29 16:53:59 Why would we need to worry about methane from the gas and oil industries? Defenders of the livestock industry have led me to believe that methane is no big deal, given that it doesn't accumulate like CO2, and only lasts for about 10-12 years. So I'm sure it'll be fine! But in all
4664 2018-11-29 16:53:58 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
4665 2018-11-29 16:53:57 Everyone who bashes coal, oil, natural gas go live without for a year and then tell me how bad it is
4666 2018-11-29 16:53:40 You nailed this one. Obama put so many limits on US oil development. Prevented building critical pipelines. The audacity of the man.
4667 2018-11-29 16:53:33 By your ridiculous logic Putin has leverage over every person or company doing or THINKING about doing business in Russia. What did Putin get? An America that is the world's largest oil producer which is causing difficulties for the Russian economy?
4668 2018-11-29 16:53:28 l'm ca. 90% carnivore. I offer: Ask "Do I miss what I've ceased eating?" I used to be Queen of Kale swimming in olive oil. Ceased kale. Ceased OO (use it now only in herb pesto). Never quantified/strategized % of non-meat items I gave up or no longer craved. It just evolved.
4669 2018-11-29 16:53:07 @suzuki2wheelers 3 months old bike. Well maintained and timely service done from dealership. Still facing engine oil leakage issue. 2018 Gixxer ABS. I wonder why Suzuki is so reluctant to solve it as it's very common issue. Other major Japanese brands are not having such issues
4670 2018-11-29 16:53:06 They say Baby Oil not good for the face but it have my shit RITE!! Lol
4671 2018-11-29 16:53:06 Ummmm ok. I guess people that try to effect change of any way that they believe in does float my boat compared to losers sitting there saying "It is what it is nothing i can do about it" thats a shit attitude man.
4672 2018-11-29 16:53:03 #Renewables may be cheap, but for some reason, 5 mbd of #oil is still use to generate power globally! Mind you, almost half of it is in the ME.

4675 2018-11-29 16:52:44 Which country am I using as a plantation? The USA has enough natural resources to provide for itself. We are now the number one oil producer. And you forget Jesus told Peter he was the rock his Church would be formed upon.
4676 2018-11-29 16:52:43 .@michellemungall @GeorgeHeyman Don’t let industry off the hook by implementing weak methane regulations for oil and gas. Inspections based on looking and smelling for an odourless invisible gas just don’t cut it #bcpoli

The smears are "real"and real actions apparently mean nothing.
4680 2018-11-29 16:52:35 It would be difficult to imagine the Saudis would have anything to discuss with her or Trudeau.
As long as we keep taking Saudi oil they will be fine.
4681 2018-11-29 16:52:28 I’m getting an oil change and the dude working on my car just winked at me and I’m like pls don’t do this, it’s too early and I just need an oil change nothing else
4682 2018-11-29 16:52:27 Laugh of the day,
Obama taking credit for the jobs and oil prices going on right now.
What kind of sickness does this man have?
4683 2018-11-29 16:52:24 Banks are trying to bail out  owners of Tailwind. Jet should be referred to NCLT by banks / oil cos or AAI. All funds intused by new owner should go to reviving airline & not to old owners. Insolvent & illiquid Jet is fit case to be referred to NCLT immediately. @jagdishshetty
4684 2018-11-29 16:52:23 Researchers have created a way to convert plastic bottle waste into ultralight polyethylene terephthalate aerogels for a variety of useful applications, like heat and sound insulation, oil spill cleaning, carbon dioxide absorption, as well as fire safety applications.
4685 2018-11-29 16:52:17 Think is time to buy some oil
4686 2018-11-29 16:52:17 Did anyone expect there would be? Really? Meanwhile Premier Notley was in Ottawa speaking to the crisis in oil & gas in Alberta & PMJT had no time to speak to her? And you would think it would be more important to talk Alberta & auto sector than this but no for PMJT
4687 2018-11-29 16:52:07 I tried that new pancake recipe out there w motor oil and cardboard and while the presentation was divine, the taste left a lot to be desired. Overall 3/10
4688 2018-11-29 16:52:07 YOU'VE NEVER USED OLIVE OIL BEFORE????
4689 2018-11-29 16:52:05 Car au delà de la question climatique, se pose le problème d'avoir dans nos rues des SUV hybrides flambant neufs, quand une 205 diesel ne pourra pas passer le periph, et bientôt l'A86.

I  Guess.  If U r the person profiting. I wish Trump would Remove us from the OPEC Dysfunctional Codependent Relationship we have, SET our oil at $75.00 a barrel, (oil drillers Lose $$$ at $50), & Declare Bankruptcy Re $20T in debt

4694 2018-11-29 16:51:52 Sounds to me that Notley, just like many of her citizens, also counted on a continuing rich oil industy as she built hundreds of new schools, protected public health care, etc. Good things to do, indeed, bit it's just like the oil industry basing its production on...
4695 2018-11-29 16:51:52 @MoghaluKingsley My vision of Nigeria beyond oil, is a vision in which innovation drives the Nigerian economy.

4696 2018-11-29 16:51:49 I hate when I bring my truck for an oil change because I see all the new trucks and my mind starts thinking
4697 2018-11-29 16:51:45 @BarackObama youre taking credit for the boom in oil & gas production & #USA economic growth? “You didn’t build that!” It happened despite your rabid #anticapitalism because hard working Americans risked all whilst you played wack a mole trying to slam them down with regulations
4698 2018-11-29 16:51:42 Noodle was cleaning the oil off Sia “Let her cool down dear.”
4699 2018-11-29 16:51:39 Getting annoyed thinking about how a boy I used to date would call tea tree oil “trees trees oil”
4700 2018-11-29 16:51:28 to clean i use saline solution (1% salt content) and to help the skin's elasticity, regular massages with any topical oils that primarily contain vitamin e are great (bio oil and emu oil are common ones, i've used emu oil and it works great)

4702 2018-11-29 16:51:19 No sympathy here---anyone with any intelligence knew what he was---snake oil salesman
4703 2018-11-29 16:51:17 10 Years in power. Zero pipelines to tidewater. The electorate are much smarter than you take us for.
I might also add that the conservative reign in Alberta did nothing to help the industry or prepare for a downturn in oil prices.
I wouldn't let you idiots manage a piggy bank.
4704 2018-11-29 16:51:16 Hell yeah just spent 2/3rds of my paycheck that i haven't even gotten yet on home heating oil! Gotta treat yourself  sometimes
4705 2018-11-29 16:51:13 I think there’s a good chance. Covered them joints in motor oil too. 
4706 2018-11-29 16:51:13 Yeah, that SOLYNDRA thing was instrumental in making America the largest oil producer. 


4707 2018-11-29 16:50:59 That guy has a face only a corrupt oil & has executive could love.
4708 2018-11-29 16:50:51 at cracker barrel asking if they got cardboard and motor oil in the kitchen
4709 2018-11-29 16:50:48 They're Twitter scientists Russ.  First it's "these data" and "these data were", not LOL "this data" and "this data was".  Second, quoting THESE data from HIDTA is akin to quoting  data from the oil and gas industry that state how detrimental solar energy is.  Unbelievable.
4710 2018-11-29 16:50:46 Talks out of both sides of his mouth. “Say thank you” for making #America the worlds largest oil producer, but we need less pollution because of #GlobalWarming and more green energy. #Hypocrite #ThursdayThoughts
4711 2018-11-29 16:50:39 EIA production forecasts include technically recoverable resources which do not require that oil & gas are commercial. 

Most tight oil reserve adds are b/c of higher oil price, not new discoveries so 4x reserve growth may required 4x price growth. Ouch.

4715 2018-11-29 16:50:24 Just started following u jud...are u serious about oil? U wouldn’t have any of these devices u are posting on if it wasn’t for oil! Canada would be gone!

4718 2018-11-29 16:50:09 Because the Chevy Volt just isn't selling ... and why should it? Gas is cheap. Ford and GM will sell SUVs and pickups.  Fiat-Chrysler will sell Jeeps.

It is the policy of our government to borrow today, pump oil today, and live it up. Tomorrow be damned.

4721 2018-11-29 16:50:04 Ah, so you're referring to Dr Soon, who was paid $400,000 to provide his views on AGW. 
You do realize that he was paid by the oil companies, and insists it's not a problem, right? So you're siding with the paid shills.
4722 2018-11-29 16:49:51 Could have just said “here’s an average soccer team.”

4733 2018-11-29 16:49:09 Read the press release-he is doing it with the support of, not against the wishes of, several major players in the oil sands such as Questerre Energy, CRNL, and Cenovus.
4734 2018-11-29 16:49:09 I need a oil change like today !
4735 2018-11-29 16:49:05 Total empty actions from Freeland. If we stopped buying Saudi oil that would be a sanction. This is nothing but a press release.

4737 2018-11-29 16:49:01 Why, why is it abusive You get far more per head than rest of country and don't give me that oil Bollox. 4bn per year at best is all its worth. Most of tax at pump not at extraction.

In addition you have a say in English only affairs. That's the abusive bit and we are victims
4738 2018-11-29 16:48:55 Until they literally have no choice because we will run out. Unfortunately they’ll wait that long then while everyone is panicking on having no oil and gas I’ll just stand there like uhhhh the sun??

4750 2018-11-29 16:48:06 Canada should be slapping sanctions on the entire country of Saudi Arabia, and looking for ways to stop importing their oil. 

(*Hint: using our own oil.) 

I'm unsure about cancelling the armoured car deal due to it being signed by previous conservative gov.
4751 2018-11-29 16:48:03 Plus the Thames barrier the whole revamp of London trains and tunes crossrail Heathrow expansion you name it it was oil backed
4752 2018-11-29 16:47:56 If you don't support the industry you don't support the people. My son feeds his family working in gas and oil. What other jobs do you expect that they are trained to do? And they are hardly destroying the planet. Build pipelines not green energy pipe dreams.
4753 2018-11-29 16:47:56 Add a little black pepper and mustard to your cheese sauce. Or a splash of truffle oil and top with breadcrumb, oregano and smoked cheese.

(This also goes for regular macaroni cheese)
4754 2018-11-29 16:47:47 ソーセージくらいは入れさせて。
4755 2018-11-29 16:47:46 If you want to get real fancy. Use a fork to poke holes in potatoes before wrapping them. Rub them with olive oil, salt, and pepper. 

You could use 2 crock pots and cook the meat separately. Potatoes do best with 6-8 hours on high. Meat is usually better 8 hours on low or 4 high

4759 2018-11-29 16:47:37 It's called a bigger picture. Our economy is bigger than crude oil. Donny doesn't understand that. Only what effects his personal bank account.

4766 2018-11-29 16:47:04 Govt should not exploit citizens. Drawing more money from oil sector will lead to discontent among people and ultimately decide future elections

4785 2018-11-29 16:45:41 Adaily mail photographer came up to me and said the editor had sent him to see if there was anything in the fracking story protestors were claiming.

I explained no and why.

I told him about the big oil find.

Nothing was ever printed. 

Unreal.
4786 2018-11-29 16:45:37 REALLY I remember you were against the oil pipeline or am I wrong???
4787 2018-11-29 16:45:35 Well, you demand to reduce oil production whereas advocate for pipeline. It seems UCP just throws contradictory ideas against a wall every day to expect some surprise to happen. #UCP @Alberta_UCP
4788 2018-11-29 16:45:29 Why post stats and charts at all when tomorrow will likely be different than anything else in the past. Loved all the FinTwit experts charting when $OIL was crashing and that a ‘reversal’ was imminent. Hint: they kept revising daily...and eventually someone will be right.
4789 2018-11-29 16:45:27 Look positively at the left and join movements rather than standing on the sides and criticizing.

4793 2018-11-29 16:45:15 Saudi economy is hinged on oil being $80/barrel. If countries stopped importing their oil, that would cripple the Kingdom and perhaps force them to play nice.
4794 2018-11-29 16:45:04 I did say grass fed beef. Not all farming system globally feed soy or other crops. In fact it’s largely US, China and EU and a reason the trade war is hurting this crop. People also don’t want to eat it(livestock feed is post oil extraction) by product.
4795 2018-11-29 16:44:58 This is such a weird attitude to me. What has ever changed in history with out people screaming for change? Sitting quietly on the sideline watching the same thing happen over and over has never ever been the reason for change.

4802 2018-11-29 16:44:31 Yes please help Venezuela Mr. President. Send in the military and remove Maduro and co. & Let's get some oil in return!
4803 2018-11-29 16:44:29 If you're gonna throw stuff in a deep fry for no reason, it should taste like something other than the paper towels it sits on afterwards to drain the oil. Just saying.
4804 2018-11-29 16:44:21 I agree with you - so many transplants think the roads are same as their "home town" - they just don't understand how oil slick sticks to roads making them super slick when there's no rain for months & months - they'll learn a costly lesson ha!
4805 2018-11-29 16:44:09 OBAMA TRYING ONE MORE TIME TO RIDE ON TRUMP ACCOMPLISHMENTS taking credit for the Nation Oil Production. Precisely the industry he fought the most. Only those with such level of hypocrisy and lack of decency can fall this low.
4806 2018-11-29 16:44:08 Interesting perspectives on whether Alberta should temporarily restrict its oil supply. Experts are ambivalent, though most feel that a restriction may be in order eventually, if not immediately. Only the most rigidly ideological figure, Ted Morton, opposes restriction outright.

4811 2018-11-29 16:43:47 Obama sent our off shore drilling to Venezuela where the tyrantS immediately nationalized the oil industry stealing American assets!
4812 2018-11-29 16:43:46 Canada only imports roughly 12% of our oil from Saudi Arabia. That can easily be replaced. Let's cut our oil export to the US to 30% from 40%. 53% of our oil is imported from the US. Let's just export less to make up the difference.

4817 2018-11-29 16:43:24 France is NATO ally, Russia and Iran are main enemy's of USA. Totally different. India is their big defence customer they can't ignore. US has already waived sanctions on India for Iran oil deal and S400 deal for that reason.
4818 2018-11-29 16:43:13 Nah, it says Timmy fell into the vat of cooking oil this time.
4819 2018-11-29 16:43:07 Obama taking credit for Trump’s booming economy & USA’s now  #1 exporter of oil- is equivalent to a worm claiming to have created the universe. 

Trump has ERASED Obama’s pathetic “legacy” & now Obama is claiming Trump’s real accomplishments as his own. 

SICK  SICK  SICK

4824 2018-11-29 16:42:41 The oil industry should pay for it.
4825 2018-11-29 16:42:36 This is not possible as of now, but in next 5 years we ll be in much better position incomparision of Dollar vs rupee value.. The less we import oil from foreign counties , value of  rupee ll automatically rise..  for this Govt is focusing more n more on renewable energy.
4826 2018-11-29 16:42:29 Fuck @realDonaldTrump, a con-artist, dumbass, scumbag snake oil salesman turned reality TV president.

4829 2018-11-29 16:42:25 So Boko Haram has more money than the oil enriched Nigerian government?
4830 2018-11-29 16:42:24 priscilla always says that if you have dry skin, to mix the foundation with your favorite moisturizer or oil for a dewy/moist finish even after it oxidizes.
4831 2018-11-29 16:42:23 Yea I'm intrigued too! Remember EVERYTHING you use during the day has some composition of oil. Maybe you need to die cuz your so stupid..! Hahah #Triggered

4833 2018-11-29 16:42:14 Why do we continue to import SA oil
4834 2018-11-29 16:42:11 What a perfect strategy to push up defense stock and in the same time 
having higher oil price that will help bank's who are tied with the fracking industry. Look behind the narrative.

4842 2018-11-29 16:41:51 I really don't mind the level gating that's perfectly fine. But why the fuck do you earn  .12c an avg loot and $3 a mission. I literally spend all my money on bullets, gun oil, and hay. I played all day yesterday and made $90. I'm not micro transactioning shit. RD1O>RD2O
4843 2018-11-29 16:41:47 yup. Oil and autos haven't been capitalist industries anywhere in the world for decades. They are instruments used for power by politicians. So .. don't invest in energy or transportation in Canada, or anywhere because governments will screw it up
4844 2018-11-29 16:41:46 Perhaps the energy companies could reduce their electricity prices as oil is dropping like a rock now.
4845 2018-11-29 16:41:44 @CadburyIreland Please STOP USING PALM OIL as vegetable oil in your products
4846 2018-11-29 16:41:42 Funny all the people trying to be on their high horse about palm oil, cadburys are actually one of the better companies, they didn't use it for like 6 years and now they use nowhere near as much as other large companies. Also why you commenting if you don't want any 
4847 2018-11-29 16:41:26 isn't that where the term Snake Oil Salesman comes from?

4852 2018-11-29 16:40:58 Their economy is driven largely by oil and gas (and other natural resources). Ebb and flow as the prices change. Toss in mob-style corruption and a Wild West-style legal system, and the result is what you see.  Thanks for reading my threads!

4854 2018-11-29 16:40:48 "result in *LOWER* LDL than OLIVE OIL"

The difference was 0.03 mmol/L (1.158 mg/dL), not really a significant difference.
4855 2018-11-29 16:40:47 And forced oil companies into deep water by denying them leases in shallow water, with catastrophic results

4905 2018-11-29 16:37:19 Lol! This is the same Obama taking credit for the boom in American oil and US prosperity which Trump created. All BO did was keep the Great Recession running so he could turn USA into a Socialist world State. So sickening people are sucked in by his grin

4910 2018-11-29 16:36:50 "Suddenly" would be under the Trump administration. So if it was you Obama, that means by you leaving office, oil production went up. And for that, thank you Obama.
If you're just trying to take credit for oil production, that must pi$$ off your lefty fans.
4911 2018-11-29 16:36:46 I can't say. If he received growth of new hair by applying some oil, how can I criticise him? Is it a fake or genuine? I don't know the details. He need not come on stage and talk all that, though. But I don't know the context.

4931 2018-11-29 16:35:10 Coconut oil can help I believe
4932 2018-11-29 16:34:58 That's a different argument altogether.  You can argue for changes to the royalty regime (I would disagree); but government (i.e. public) funds from resource revenue are directly tied to oil pricing.  Lower prices mean lower government take all other things equal.

4937 2018-11-29 16:34:42 Have you also argued against the new LNG facility? I certainly understand your concerns about the coast line but your neighbors rely on oil production as does B.C. forests, shipping, natural gas and animal agriculture. We are all part of the problem.

4946 2018-11-29 16:34:04 @jkenney What school of business did the you go to ? 

Cutting production = layoffs becoz less employees required , yet industry will make more profits from your savings handout

 Plus there are layoffs happening in the oil patch right now.Whats your solution to stop that??
4947 2018-11-29 16:34:04 Theoretically possible but hard. Many drawdown figures are assuming slow processes. There are way to accelerate at many scales if we are willing to use oil energy (keeping a very careful eye to the carbon budget)
4948 2018-11-29 16:34:00 そうですよ 寝て
4949 2018-11-29 16:33:57 INR Being under 70 isn't due to government intervention. The oil prices have fallen down and hence outflow of rupeee had come down. Worsening rupee is a news when government doesn't intervene.
4950 2018-11-29 16:33:51 Ok.

What is your point?

We have already established there are no clients/buyers, not enough at any rate, for this oil.

Leave it in the ground. Problem of extra solved.
4951 2018-11-29 16:33:47 What a joke he is!  He’s the one who implemented all those regulations to stop productions of oil and now he takes credit for it?Delusion of grandeur!  Lol. No one cares about you.  Go away already!!!
4952 2018-11-29 16:33:38 Totally understand the sustainable pal oil issue however nothing in Marks and Spencer is labelled with RSPO plus we grow plenty of rapeseed and sunflower oil in this country.
4953 2018-11-29 16:33:32 Maybe stop puting all your jobs in the oil basket. 
Also he bought Alberta a pipe line
4954 2018-11-29 16:33:16 In 2012, @IEA reported that Nigeria loses US$7 billion (N1.159 trillion: 2014) yearly to crude oil theft.
4955 2018-11-29 16:33:15 You are mixing oil and water that's not what the article said. Go read it again and open the evidence docket.

4957 2018-11-29 16:33:09 what is that? :( girl put a lil sugar in that and it tastes sooo good! it’s also good for menstruating as well. personally i was glad i had the castor oil cos it helped my first PP poop. Lol.
4958 2018-11-29 16:33:08 Imo spooner is gonna be like Cammalleri... he got an opportunity with Nuge Drai and McDavid and he has 0 points n he's -6
4959 2018-11-29 16:33:07 Anyone whoever thought mining our oil was for the exclusive use of Americans ? Ah no. Sold to the highedt bidder.
4960 2018-11-29 16:33:03 I wish.  Too bad there aren't enough cards with "oil" in the name!  Maybe in a few years haha.
4961 2018-11-29 16:32:46 If oil is priced in multiple currencies, then unless the USD is weakened MEANINGFULLY v. the gold reference point, shale will be left in the ground.
4962 2018-11-29 16:32:43 Obama Touts Climate Change Legacy, Then Takes Credit For US Oil Boom - this arrogant jive turkey is beyond irrelevancy. What a lout!
4963 2018-11-29 16:32:37 @Groupon Hello, I am tweeting you in regards to a groupon I bought for Valvoline. I purchased a groupon for an oil change and unfortunately they can not change my oil. They do not have the proper tools to take off my skid plate on my Volkswagen Beetle.
4964 2018-11-29 16:32:33 Please we are tired of oil. It has done us no good.

4965 2018-11-29 16:32:31 Do you understand how many times I've seen a picture of pancakes and the whole time I was craving motor oil.
4966 2018-11-29 16:32:07 Ugh. Double ugh. Capital double “UGH”....getting my oil changed and I hear this horrible, blood curdling, bone chilling screeching sound....not good. 

They are watching “The View” in the waiting area.  It’s unbearable. 

UGH!
4967 2018-11-29 16:32:07 Willie Rennie like David Mundell is a typical unionist careerist, their career depends on the Union, so it’s Union at all costs, if that means Scotland has food banks and oil rigs, they don’t care, the welfare of the people means nothing, only their career matters. #Indyref2
4968 2018-11-29 16:32:01 @thataylaa how do you sleep with rose hip oil on without ruining your balnkets and sheet pillow? Love your channel btw!
4969 2018-11-29 16:31:55 BUT MOTOR OIL :(
4970 2018-11-29 16:31:53 Oil prices sank to their lowest levels in more than a year, with the U.S. benchmark dropping below $50, as swelling domestic inventories and record production scared off investors.

Sibuk ngan kuil orang..  Esok minyak turun??
4971 2018-11-29 16:31:46 Une taxation à  l'achat/ surface occupée ?
4972 2018-11-29 16:31:42 Global oil prices are declining but OGRA is stubborn for consistent increase in petrole prices. As officers are controlling OGRA and hon’ble Chief Justice is requested rescue masses from barbarous price hike every now & then while PM also does not show any concern for people.
4973 2018-11-29 16:31:34 I hope news about OGRA's petrol price summary is not true. Oil prices are currently around $50. Even our current rate of Rs.98 is too high. While it's unfair to blame PTI for this entirely, something needs to be done to pass the benefit of the Saudi oil package to end consumers.
4974 2018-11-29 16:31:25 It’s cuz no one spit oil on her
4975 2018-11-29 16:31:20 God invented eucalyptus oil infused tissues 
4976 2018-11-29 16:31:15 This is simply not true! The push for American oil independence started during the last years of the Bush administration. Obama just saw through its completion. In fact, starting the oil independence ball rolling is probably one of President Bush's greatest accomplishments.
4977 2018-11-29 16:31:10 Give me a break he tried to kill the oil companies.

4981 2018-11-29 16:30:55 No, more like Hickman Motors! Where  it takes longer than 3 hours to do an oil change for whatever reason  if my car didn’t still have warranty I wouldn’t be going there either.
4982 2018-11-29 16:30:52 Advance mag isip.?!?.. Bakit di ka muna kya magpsalamat na lower oil prices ntin ngyon.
4983 2018-11-29 16:30:48 Then again, maybe if the Oilers agree to eat half or take MacDonald and some $$ Holmgren will take him in Philly :)
4984 2018-11-29 16:30:47 My car got this got this oil changed and full tank of gas now she got a new kick in her
4985 2018-11-29 16:30:43 Entourage is our Black Seed Oil! 
Black Seed is known as Nigella Sativa which is a cousin to the Hemp plant 

It is CBD and THC free which has an entourage effect and provides many powerful benefits!
4986 2018-11-29 16:30:39 My sister is finally getting an oil change on my car today..  I should never leave her to do anything!!! She puts most of the miles on it anyways

4991 2018-11-29 16:30:18 So you do realize that the oil sand is the largest oil spill the earth has seen and technically we are cleaning it up!
4992 2018-11-29 16:30:14 It was all BHO. His strangling policies against coal and oil led to an immense backlash and swung the pendulum all the way back in the opposite direction as far as it could go. If he hadn't tried to kill it no one would have tried to save it. Thanks Barack for your ineptitude!
4993 2018-11-29 16:30:08 You’re certainly not alone regarding the roster, but screaming doesn’t make it any better, nor does it make it worse I hope the coaching change makes a difference. That said, I’ll still enjoy watching the boys play. Have a good day guys

4999 2018-11-29 16:29:34 Obama is feeding the new narrative. Originally he said Trump couldn't do all these things now he is taking credit. Economy, Oil, black unemployment. He is a modern day carpet bagger. His ego might actually be bigger than Trump's.  He should take credit for Russian meddling!
5000 2018-11-29 16:29:21 He put him out as a defenseman in an elimination playoff game! Nobody will ever be able to convince me he didn't trust him haha.

But yeah I could see him getting frustrated with a lack of offense
5001 2018-11-29 16:29:17 And Russia will still be pumping oil at stupendous profit building a national balance sheet that is the envy of the world.
5002 2018-11-29 16:29:08 broke: thinking the Dresden bombing was worse than the Holocaust

bespoke: recognizing the fruitlessness in city bombing but thinking it's funny
5003 2018-11-29 16:29:05 70 hours of meetings with Mueller! Now I like dicking around so that maybe only 10 hours of a 70 hour session with me would be usable, but I have a feeling that somebody "under sentence of death by something lingering, either boiling oil or melted lead" would get down to business
5004 2018-11-29 16:28:59 Bc it would have done more harm than good and was estimated to raise pollution levels tremendously in just a few years bc of how dirty the crude oil is.....also gonna mention the hundreds of thousands of native lives that were saved but ya...what a liar!!!
5005 2018-11-29 16:28:59 If you want the free market to do its job, why is Kenney @jkenney proposing government interference in oil production.  If oil companies want to reduce their production it should be their decision not Notley’s - they are the experts.
5006 2018-11-29 16:28:57 Qp starts with Ryan Meili asking about Alberta buying railcars to ship oil and what the government is doing to help the sector. Minister Bronwyn Eyre says it's good to finally hear Meili talking pipelines, and what took so long to support the oil sector #skpoli

5027 2018-11-29 16:26:51 A perfect definition of bubble in which media  amplifying enthusiasm to attract more investors jump in. A sign of late stage of speculation. Goldman Sachs issued it's bullish call on oil when oil price was at 140 before financial crisis.

5032 2018-11-29 16:26:21 Obama, Democrat Congressman and Democrat Governors did every thing they could for eight years to slow down Oil and Gas production.
5033 2018-11-29 16:26:21 What BS. He shut down coal, didn't allow the Keystone pipeline, and his lousy inspectors allowed a BP oil spill.
5034 2018-11-29 16:26:16 Are we still buying their oil?

5037 2018-11-29 16:26:04 Sanctions against individuals not the Country.
No selfie or photo op Sanctions?
Keep selling them military hardware and taking their oil?
5038 2018-11-29 16:26:03 The lie here is that Obama did everything he could to reduce production. Federal land oil and gas permits plummeted while he was in office. The oil production skyrocketed on private lands; in spite of Obama. It’s a fat lie Obama is saying.
5039 2018-11-29 16:25:56 Raising the age of enlisting to 25 will probably be the end of the military though. Because you then have the reason to not let yourself killed for the rich mens oil millions.

5045 2018-11-29 16:25:42 What annoys me more than annything is when i go to get an oil change i look at what time the place opens its supposed to have opened an hour before i got there and its closed  soo annoying but got shopping done and made dinner for work so im good. Now if only i could sleep 
5046 2018-11-29 16:25:42 Exactly.  What good is being able to scale up or scale down if you can't get the oil to market.  Just ask Canada.

5072 2018-11-29 16:23:36 Naw its cause of the kids.  Child tax credit.  It's a liberal position offered by Ivanka.  Minimum wages are up, bonuses are being given the economy and oil production are so good obama is taking credit for them. Tax cuts 2.0 will now target the middle class.
5073 2018-11-29 16:23:29 Notice how the robots cheer—but if Trump said how much oil production increased, he would be a monster for destroying the planet.
5074 2018-11-29 16:23:24 Actually the US surpassed SA in oil production under Obama. The left hates it when you bring it up..  of course, with all do respect good sir.. you’re awesome..
5075 2018-11-29 16:23:19 i know petrolatum n mineral oil is really gd for the skin. however its not a sustainable ingredient as its come from fossil fuels n we all know will run out soon. there is no way to reproduce these raw materials. gd for skin but bad for environment. chemistry so interesting
5076 2018-11-29 16:23:15 In 2006, Nancy Pelosi refused to issue oil permits. This caused $4 a gallon gas and caused the global economic meltdown! Obamanomics only continued to feed the recession. In 1 year Trump reversed it!!

5079 2018-11-29 16:23:10 Nothing wrong with being an optimist but IMO there is a big difference between a pessimist and realist. That said, pretty sure Dennis, I and a hoard of others have been screaming from the hilltops about the roster construction for ages now #Oilers

5081 2018-11-29 16:22:59 The major problem is that permits for oil and gas on federal lands plummeted while he was in office. Production skyrocketed on private land. It was in spite of him and his administration’s efforts to reduce production. It’s one of the fattest lies in the history of lies.
5082 2018-11-29 16:22:59 And at my age of 50 I’ve depleted all my funds losing my job and oil in the street could not find anything that could save my family I need to take desperate measures maybe they need to start thinking of donating to me so that I can start in the real estate business

5084 2018-11-29 16:22:54 Pro tip for the winter from someone with eczema:

Use olive oil, coconut oil, argan oil, jojoba oil, tea tree oil and shea butter to keep your skin soft and moisturized. Take out the shea butter and that mixture of oils can be used on your lips and hair. You're welcome :)
5085 2018-11-29 16:22:45 Oil blotting sheets are so humbling

5091 2018-11-29 16:21:33 There has never been a man more full of shit then Barack Obama. While he's claiming credit for oil production increases coming off of private land, he shut down all contracts for drilling on Federal Land, and wouldn't allow it. ALONG WITH his war against coal. MAGA!

5093 2018-11-29 16:21:30 Funny. The steel industry is a small portion of US exports. Unionized as well. He removed the bargaining element of the Labour Agreement. And 40% of US oil comes from Canada.

5108 2018-11-29 16:20:16 Can u also compare price rise when crude oil gone up ?? If not increased by that much % then why u expect at par reductions?? Ok ... u r blind in modi hatred or what??
5109 2018-11-29 16:20:08 That’s great but someone needs to be in the oil game...we have the best environmental and ethically made product on the planet..

5116 2018-11-29 16:19:45 Hi Stephanie, thanks for tweeting! All of our palm oil is purchased from sustainable, segregated sources and we've been members of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil since 2006. We hope this answers your query, Kind regards.
5117 2018-11-29 16:19:43 Look into charity fraud.  Collusion with Russian mafia for weapons deals.  Oil pipelines. Imran Awan spy ring. Selling our Uranium.  Official communications being hidden from the record. Etc!!!

5119 2018-11-29 16:19:37 So,what happens if Saudi Arabia says we are not shipping any crude oil to Canada
5120 2018-11-29 16:19:30 The only oil they're responsible for is the oil used to straighten Michelle's hair.
5121 2018-11-29 16:19:28 Russian oil .... go on?
5122 2018-11-29 16:19:22 But not meaningful enuf to stop us buying $2Billion a year of oil, refined by Irving, who counts on SA for 40% of its crude.
5123 2018-11-29 16:19:16 Hey also the Mercers have this weird fetish about nuclear fallout, like some people do with gingko leaves and tea tree oil. Sleep well!
5124 2018-11-29 16:19:10 The man tried to shut down the oil business.  It got stronger despite of him, not because of him.
5125 2018-11-29 16:19:09 My doctor said castor oil will give me diarrhea and I don’t wanna poop myself 
5126 2018-11-29 16:19:09 I rarely mind if the same oil is used or utensils, mainly cos I don’t want to cause more of a fuss than I apparently already am  but I do appreciate when they change the utensils or at least highlight it to me
5127 2018-11-29 16:19:08 Oh yeah, I'm not saying he didn't, just that Strome definitely would have fit Hitches system better than Spooner.

I also think Todd trusted Pouliot quite a bit.

5133 2018-11-29 16:18:37 ...to change the buying habits of the public. Just as the oil industry is changing as a result of environmental concerns, it would seem so is the automotive industry.
5134 2018-11-29 16:18:36 Yeah not much talk outside Canada on this. Also consider US production is on a ~3-5mo lag from oil prices. Shale decline rates and reduction is capex can lead to a meaningful in US production in the next 6-12mo

5137 2018-11-29 16:18:29 Perhaps, but people don't usually talk about solid resources going dry the way they do about liquid resources (water, oil, milk, etc.). Creeks, wells and cows go dry, not mines, forests and quarries.

It sounds like a clumsily mixed metaphor, TBH.
5138 2018-11-29 16:18:27 Why don’t you ask the prime minister why does Canada still buys Saudi oil
5139 2018-11-29 16:18:25 especially olive oil

5141 2018-11-29 16:18:15 AND the government closed the Vessel Traffic Centre operated by Coast Guard in Vancouver Harbour. AND, no one can actually say where these tankers are taking the heavy oil, there are no clients for it.

-That lovely brown turkey? That's also motor oil. The steam rising from it is a cigarette.
-Bowl full of cereal and milk? White glue.

5147 2018-11-29 16:17:37 I work in the oil field; Obama, that’s a big fat lie bro. You opened the east coast tanks to hold hundreds of thousands of imported barrels from OPEC, because you thought fracking would fail. Now, we’re using those tanks to export, and Texas destroyed OPEC.

5155 2018-11-29 16:17:04 When are you going to stop using #dirtypalmoil ? Iceland have highlighted the destruction caused by this oil. You can't ignore it. Lindt don't use it in their chocolate. What's your excuse?

5181 2018-11-29 16:15:25 I know that Trump wants control of the marginal barrel of oil to set the price, but once the market is no longer primarily priced in dollars that 'power' is heavily muted unlike in the days of petrodollar monopoly.

5196 2018-11-29 16:14:52 Quite so.

1948-1972 includes most of the post-WW2 rebuild of the economy.
1973-2017 includes the oil crisis and the 2008 global financial crisis.

To suggest EU membership is to blame for the difference in growth rates is the work of charlatans, frauds, and economic clowns.

5204 2018-11-29 16:14:25 Hey Bruce, still waiting for an explanation how Obama can take credit for current oil production levels. Was it the moratorium on fracking? Nope! Was it Solyndra? Nope!  Well? You so smart, should be a slam dunk, no?

5210 2018-11-29 16:14:05 بعد جلسة محاكمات ماراثونية انتهت قبل قليل .. صدور حكم جديد بحبس 13 متهما بالتستر على الهاربين من "خلية العبدلي"
5211 2018-11-29 16:14:05 Yes everything was golden under Mobama. Golden sky, golden immigration, golden globe awards, golden oil production, golden unemployment. And yes his great big golden handshake for doing such a golden job. He’s so meekly modest he should be given special golden award for humility.
5212 2018-11-29 16:14:03 At all tlhe mma...Kana I once read a story of a cook who got fired for taking USED cooking oil home...USED cooking oil..and to think some bone steal millions
5213 2018-11-29 16:13:47 Fantasizing about very expensive and polluting oil shale for energy independence didn’t pay out well for the past 25 years. It isn’t going to do now. As to North American energy, Canada has been selling out to #China for the last 18 years.
5214 2018-11-29 16:13:38 Dont eat pringle's they are made from plum oil
5215 2018-11-29 16:13:36 Add oil ka
5216 2018-11-29 16:13:33 The Obama regulations resulted in higher gas prices and restrictions on every aspect of the oil industry. He's a blatant liar. And unless he's been hypnotized or brain damaged, not even @BarackObama believes his own lies.

5217 2018-11-29 16:13:29 Even if there was truth to the Trump organization wanting to do a real estate deal in Russia, it's not illegal. First it never happened; second Trump divested; and third, it's not a crime. Look at Bush's oil deals & Clinton's real estate deals. This is media circus for politics!

5219 2018-11-29 16:13:26 I finally understand about the engine oil lol
5220 2018-11-29 16:13:18 My paper (w/ Stephanie Searle of ICCT) "Linking soy oil demand from the US Renewable Fuel Standard to palm oil expansion through an analysis on vegetable oil price elasticities" just accepted on the Q1 review Energy Policy.
5221 2018-11-29 16:13:18 11/21/2018 Baker-Hughes US Rig Count Total = -3 to 1,079, Oil -3 to 885, Gas Flat at 194, DIR = 73, HZ = 929, Vert = 77
5222 2018-11-29 16:13:12 ban their oil from Canada. No more imports of Saudi oil into our east coast and Montreal refineries. And nor more refined products from US refineries that came from Saudi oil.

5224 2018-11-29 16:13:10 looks nice after the oil spill
5225 2018-11-29 16:13:07 It still does. Sami rights were still ridiculed until the 80s, but the current govt. is trying to roll back Sami rights. Pretty successfully, since they are deferred from parliament.

Liberalism? After the oil boom. Socially conservative worker solidarity was norm post-WW2.
5226 2018-11-29 16:12:57 おれもさ、ﾄﾞﾊﾞｧと行きたい日もあるわけよ。。
5227 2018-11-29 16:12:54 Yes, but they don't have to make the #1 recipient of that oil money the top candidate. In light of the IPCC report, this is unacceptable. But when given a chance to attack the prog left while bending over backwards to appease the right, centrist dems will never fail to oblige
5228 2018-11-29 16:12:48 "What do you mean you dont have a 300$ wacom tablet and 1200$ in software and 500$ in oil paints and pastels? Are you even a real artist?" Some of my favorite art things are mechanical pencil and printer paper
5229 2018-11-29 16:12:43 Not a shock that Bernie Bros fell for the old Nigerian oil prince scam.

5232 2018-11-29 16:12:32 Oil production grow by 88 percent during his two terms
5233 2018-11-29 16:12:32 The  nonsense talked by Sambit patra BJP spokes person against the Nehru gandhi family. Do not deserve to be prime Minister and Congress president. Does he deserve to be Director of ONGC without knowing ABC of Oil Industry. If he can become director ONGC Rahul is better qualified
5234 2018-11-29 16:12:18 Reminds me of Saddam burning the oil fields of Kuwait when he was forced out.
5235 2018-11-29 16:12:18 So are you telling me fossil fuels aren’t bad for the planet?  That crude oil mining sites aren’t dirty?  That the oil and energy industry loves rolling back regulations meant to prevent accidents like deepwater horizon?  Even though they’ve already happened once?  Okay.
5236 2018-11-29 16:12:15 The Saudi gov't must be absolutely shaken! Seriously, what's the point? Why not stop/limit oil imports if you want to make a point?
5237 2018-11-29 16:12:13 OMG - he’s bragging about that? He said oil (and gas)...that’s fracking, people. Way to Orwell that one, Obama! 
5238 2018-11-29 16:12:13 بالله لاتقهرنا زياده ماعاد نتحمل اقسم بالله العظيم كم انقهرت بسبب مقطع اخوها ليته ضربهم الله يرزقهم القوة
5239 2018-11-29 16:12:02 getting my hair done while my man gets my oil changed and car cleaned. is this how the 1% live?
5240 2018-11-29 16:11:58 Low oil prices only help those companies with LOW DEBT. American oil companies are hurt more because it cost them more to produce oil than imports. While 9% of our oil come from Saudi Arabia and nearly 40% from Canada. Production and imports should be reduced to stabilize cost.
5241 2018-11-29 16:11:56 Na u wan stain the diety head with palm oil??
5242 2018-11-29 16:11:56 Americans know full well that the Saudi king ordered the killing. They also killed Americans in 911. They are a worthless partners. Most of the world terrorist are supported by them. But big oil and big weapons companies are dictating the morality of U.S.A.  Not happy.
5243 2018-11-29 16:11:51 If oil is our birthright, shouldn't %100 of the profits go to us? 
5244 2018-11-29 16:11:50 @BarackObama come on dude, you blocked the pipeline and put so many regulations in place to block United States to produce oil. You are one delusional person
5245 2018-11-29 16:11:46 manufacturing ke oil and gas? nak selesa jadi lah manufacturing engineer. Nak power jadi lah engineer yang terlibat dengan projek mega oil and gas
5246 2018-11-29 16:11:31 Ok. So why did you go back on your promise and start accepting donations to the democratic party from fuel and oil companies again? How about you act now? You’re part of the issue.
5247 2018-11-29 16:11:29 Welcome to your first rain storm! If you're driving, roads are slick with oil from no rain for a year. Drive slowly and let the other crazies take the risks! First rule of driving in our first few rain storms here in So Cal!
5248 2018-11-29 16:11:22 i finally remembered to put my coconut hair oil in BEFORE my hair dried today & it makes such a difference my hair is Silky Smooth
5249 2018-11-29 16:11:18 Eco nuts are putting our nation at risk by reducing the amount of money needed for social programs because we can not get a fair price on world markets for oil and gas
5250 2018-11-29 16:11:16 And you are lucky if you happen to be the standby husband
5251 2018-11-29 16:11:16 ass oil???
5252 2018-11-29 16:11:10 Hell*
5253 2018-11-29 16:11:07 everyones tooting and hollering about coconut oil...but maracuja oil...now maracuja oil is skincare M A G I C.
5254 2018-11-29 16:11:07 ,#UKOG LSE zoom get you ar#se down here instead of talking shite. 

Oil tankers are enough. 

That what you need to see . Idiot.

5256 2018-11-29 16:11:00 Is there olive oil in the cake? 
5257 2018-11-29 16:10:53 Even the most annoying part is they claim u should go & bring a cow,goat,oil & so on jux to play with ur mind like ar baby whilst I know it's illusion thruout. When at all will these lazy people wake up & love rightfully. Smh @Blakkrasta @zylofon1021fm #BlackPotSegment
5258 2018-11-29 16:10:47 Why are y’all still freaking out over moter oil on pancakes? I can’t stand locals
5259 2018-11-29 16:10:43 There's this cool recipe in the article.  Thanks!

"take a potato, remove its skin (where at least some nutrients are found), cut it, deep fry the pieces in oil and top it all off with salt, cheese, chili or gravy"
5260 2018-11-29 16:10:38 I don't know about you guys, but I've always eaten cardboard pancakes with motor oil.
5261 2018-11-29 16:10:37 Tell that to Norway and StatOil.

That country is sitting on a sovereign wealth fund built by the national oil company (similar to ABs Heritage Fund) worth $1 Trillion dollars.

Tell me how THAT is bad for their nation. Please.
5262 2018-11-29 16:10:31 So hungry!
Need me some Cardboard and Motor oil 
5263 2018-11-29 16:10:23 เกรดอ่อ ? 555
5264 2018-11-29 16:10:20 Your speech, I will call "it's Alberta's oil", didn't sit well with me for two reasons. RN won that battle (free market) and oil, while in the ground, is Alberta's but once it's out, the producer owns it. Felt a little Venezuelan to me. Don't think yesterday helped our cause.
5265 2018-11-29 16:10:20 ベスーベスー！はははやめろってくすぐったい～
5266 2018-11-29 16:10:19 One side of the world orange-u-tans burn on the fires of palm oil plantations and somewhere else in the world a previously thought extinct breed of mammal makes a return of the woolie-faces.
Bit like a return of King Kong but thecampaign being paid for by ordinary Joe
5267 2018-11-29 16:10:17 But we better still buy oil from them , who would want that stuff from Alberta and Sask. The only thing those provinces are good for is supporting the welfare province of #Quebec I guess.
5268 2018-11-29 16:10:15 That’ll show em!
Now keep that Saudi oil coming!
What a pathetic joke you are.
5269 2018-11-29 16:10:15 Poor Trump All those handjobs and bj's and Senate still is going to look into Saudi Arabia. Would someone tell dummy, we don't  get much oil from SA, so quit thanking them for gas prices. Jeez, idiot.
5270 2018-11-29 16:10:05 Re-positioning the facts. “We have not listened to the tape, because we do not understand the language and don’t know all the facts.” -  “we see no smoking gun because we are not looking for one, therefore it doesn’t exist.” Case closed. Money money, money, oil, oil, oil
5271 2018-11-29 16:10:05 Nice winter coat Angela , not going to chck oil a
5272 2018-11-29 16:10:03 Endless oil story
5273 2018-11-29 16:09:59 "Supply, please meet Demand. I think the two of you will really hit it off."
5274 2018-11-29 16:09:56 I just wanna thank god because I dropped my car off at Nissan for an inspection and oil change and they ain’t call me tryna say I needed this that or the third done 
5275 2018-11-29 16:09:55 Mining industry is lagging behind the oil sector ~Christopher Nyamko @penplusbytes @NRGInstitute @AcepPower
5276 2018-11-29 16:09:53 That may have been the result, but to say that was their objective is scurrilous and unworthy: equivalent to saying the objective of the oil industry is to destroy the environment.
5277 2018-11-29 16:09:43 Lol, I'm sure it will. I have a morphe single that looks exactly the same and it def stains. But, micellar water and coconut oil take it off (and I do have very pale, sensitive skin, but the pink is so bright I couldn't resist lol)
5278 2018-11-29 16:09:42 Gonna be a glut of personal trainers in a couple of years...
5279 2018-11-29 16:09:29 Apologies for the delays on that route caused by a broken down freight train. This has now moved however the freight has left behind a large amount of oil which requires cleaning before the line opens. ^DA
5280 2018-11-29 16:09:26 You’ll see me playing my Hindi music acting like I’m some sheik that has oil money . 
5281 2018-11-29 16:09:24 Did you wash the Z? Or is that all of the gas and oil leaking?jk love the vids man.
5282 2018-11-29 16:09:23 Bio oil
5283 2018-11-29 16:09:15 Right at the time the world consumption of oil is continually slowing down. Perfect timing.
5284 2018-11-29 16:09:13 ゲームに熱中してたら全部終わってた
5285 2018-11-29 16:09:09 Billionaire Irvings who import Saudi oil to Saint John refinery will never allow it.
5286 2018-11-29 16:08:52 Je ne pense pas qu'il existe une base légale pour qu'elle puissent mettre cela en place
5287 2018-11-29 16:08:50 Hahahah!  They pity am...
5288 2018-11-29 16:08:49 @DavidSuzukiFDN We would have more money to cool the planet if our oil industry wasn't losing market share to the Saudis
5289 2018-11-29 16:08:44 Vegetable oil, processed foods, no nutrient density, FDA recommendations.
5290 2018-11-29 16:08:43 Trump is right - he didn't have 2 stop doing business while being a candidate - the deal didn't go thru & he won
Since that he's put more sanctions on Russia, has shut down the Russian Seattle embassy & expeled 60 Russian diplomats - increased US oil production - Boosted Military
5291 2018-11-29 16:08:40 Plz note that nobody can be 
100 % right all d time. Our accuracy is around 80 %. Just check movement of commodity market. still we r able to be at least 70 % right. This month accuracy 73%.
Last month 83 %.
During NG & oil volatility, 1 big US company went bankrupt. V survived.
5292 2018-11-29 16:08:26 So let’s reset.....
The economy is due to Obama.
The booming oil industry is due to Obama.
NOKO behaving itself is due to Obama.
The new trade deals are due to Obama.

Why couldn’t we have elected him ‘President For Life’........
5293 2018-11-29 16:08:16 That one scene where she was in black paint or oil idk what it is, is still stuck in my mind
5294 2018-11-29 16:08:16 Is this guy for real?  What world is he living in?  We All know Hussein did whatever he could to fight Big Oil and US energy independence.  Thank God along came #POTUS Trump!!
5295 2018-11-29 16:08:16 Obama the climate change fanatic bragging about oil production.
These leftists are skitzo
5296 2018-11-29 16:08:11 Dear Gov't of #Canada,
Imposing Magnitsky Sanctions on the 17 Saudis is a nice headline in response to #Kashoggi but completely baseless and hiprocritical if you continue to import $10 MM in Saudi oil per day. You directly financially support the The House of Saud #StopSaudiOil
5297 2018-11-29 16:07:56 I can’t believe the province almost burned down and their fucking answer is “more oil”
5298 2018-11-29 16:07:54 sebab dia punya tekstur mcm cleansing oil cuma ada biji2 halus. so sy confuse nk pkai before or after cleanser 
5299 2018-11-29 16:07:43 Only for oil and gas. Concession based. Not for fertilizer business which is subsidized gas for cheap input to farmers
5300 2018-11-29 16:07:33 Oil Tycoons don't like the cold?!
5301 2018-11-29 16:07:27 air drying your hair and coconut oil!!
5302 2018-11-29 16:07:21 @BarackObama claiming he helped American oil producers is like Hitler claiming that he helped the Jewish people. I will be praying for you, #44.
5303 2018-11-29 16:07:21 はじめまして！代行していただきたいです！
5304 2018-11-29 16:07:20 Its weird that my skin only feel less dehydrated when i cleanse my face with oil.

But I hate oil
5305 2018-11-29 16:07:06 Oil was not be moving just yet  rail cars are not available which might take up to a year and that’s only for 120k anyways .
5306 2018-11-29 16:07:00 Sure, under the Nuremberg rules, this if fine, but what about Hitler? Cowards all in the face of money and oil. Let’s not forget, Iran has a democracy, though messed up, and the Saudi’s an absolute monarchy. The last of those in Europe was decapitated a few hundred years ago!
5307 2018-11-29 16:07:00 I add MCT oil to my coffee in the morning. It doesnt really change the taste. I am having chicken wings for lunch though lol
5308 2018-11-29 16:06:51 Abegiiiii
5309 2018-11-29 16:06:51 It would seem just as appropriate and more pro-Canadian to also impose sanctions on Russian oil and gas exports. @JustinTrudeau two birds one stone as Russia is Canada's largest like good export competitor. @poroshenko @Grybauskaite_LT @BBCWorld @lillyblaudszun
5310 2018-11-29 16:06:44 oh you mean.. North Dakota used to truly go by Friendly State, we were in every sense. Until the Oil Boom of 2008. It's been bad ever since. I miss my homestate's hospitality. I'm here and I miss it. It's saddening.
5311 2018-11-29 16:06:41 Ponete a vender panchos afuera de Fuel Oil, alto negocio
5312 2018-11-29 16:06:33 Completepy agree that Puljujarvi isn't very good (yet) but if he's not being used in a spot where he can produce offence, why the he'll was he drafted.

Lmao jk.. spooner imo will never be back to his old ways but he might get 20 points this year. I'd play a 4th pick over him tbh
5313 2018-11-29 16:06:32 Granted its Dollarisation before our eyes, BUT is a price of $1.30or $1.34 in USD a fair price considering crude oil is on a downward spiral? 

Also is Excise duty on fuel being paid in USD? If not, why would one charge USD at a higher scale when the tax component is local?
5314 2018-11-29 16:06:23 I don’t feel an iota of sympathy for #Alberta. For decades instead of innovation you collectively choose to invest all your eggs in one oil soaked basket. Now that short sighted dumb fuck decision is coming home to roost. It’s pathetic the rest of us must clean up your mess.
5315 2018-11-29 16:06:19 And the person who ordered the killing? Nothing!
Yet we continue to buy Saudi oil at $50/bbl when we are getting $15/bbl for Canadian oil.
5316 2018-11-29 16:06:16 i think @olamide_YBNL  drank anointing oil last sunday...
5317 2018-11-29 16:06:13 Oil companies wouldn't drill if you stopped using oil. How much coal was excavated and burned to power the electronics you use? Just so you can go on twitter and complain to all the other leftists who are morally outraged.
5318 2018-11-29 16:06:08 The easy money has been made on the down side. Nobody wants our oil, its a mess, production cannot increase, investment $$ is leaving Canada. The industry is a joke! Moronic to follow IMO. I like seeing rookies buy $bte call options for Dec. He is down a pretty $$$! "OIL KING"
5319 2018-11-29 16:06:01 I'll tell you a little secret it is over! Alberta is nothing more then a strategic oil reserve for the U.S.
5320 2018-11-29 16:06:00 ok... that’s a week of oil dude. still dangerous. go back to scheduling me for more hours this week thx
5321 2018-11-29 16:05:54 Omg yes with some baby oil 
5322 2018-11-29 16:05:48 Yeah I wouldn’t really recommend the scrub but you should definitely try the glow oil.
5323 2018-11-29 16:05:48 So we're sanctioning the guys that MBS is going to execute anyway as part of his ongoing cover story?  How about an oil and arms embargo? #cdnpoli #KashoggiMurder
5324 2018-11-29 16:05:44 Now quit importing Saudi oil
5325 2018-11-29 16:05:44 Yes! Slow and steady all night. Havoc on the roads..  pple forget water and oil don't mix.. and roads are loaded with oil.. dry right now.. more to come..
5326 2018-11-29 16:05:40 My uncle once reset his hair’s oil production by not showering for a week (after doing it twice a day for a while) and it completely and entirely morphed how his hair looks
5327 2018-11-29 16:05:34 Obama boosted domestic oil production the way he boosted nation-wide gun sales.
#UpYoursStatists
5328 2018-11-29 16:05:29 Operating on almost zero sleep! I need a nap. Im at Toney Oil so thats pretty much same thing!
5329 2018-11-29 16:05:15 De la même manière que pour la vignette Crit'air, les collectivités pourraient-elles interdire l'accès aux véhicules trop lourds / puissants / encombrants / bruyants (SUV, scooters Tmax..).
En on-t-elle la compétence?
Car la solution ne viendra pas de l'Etat.
5330 2018-11-29 16:05:13 Love @IcelandRichard ‘s point about not replacing one problem with another. That’s why his nuanced palm oil stance is so important. Crude bans too often don’t help. #CIPRConf18
5331 2018-11-29 16:05:12 Oil
5332 2018-11-29 16:05:04 It started from a conversation where my supes were talking abt oil n gas which lead to politics which lead to.. that
5333 2018-11-29 16:05:03 Someone that stopped drilling of more oil 
5334 2018-11-29 16:05:02 Como decía la mamá de una amiga, "nunca lo supo". Nada más viviendo aquí tienen que decir voucher, standby, 'oil and gas',... Un man que se graduó del colegio conmigo, fue a clases de franchute en la Alianza desde noveno. En once salía con "¿se dice tren o tgan?".
5335 2018-11-29 16:04:59 Have stopped buying digestives as they contain palm oil,  #rainforest #orangutan Trying to #bakemyown don't know how long this will last!
5336 2018-11-29 16:04:35 Also, you do know that the east coast (except Nfld.) has seen their unemployment rates drop over the past three years? Yes, Edmonton and Alberta are suffering because they only rely on oil, and oil prices fluctuate.
5337 2018-11-29 16:04:31 Vamos. Nomás que pase esta época navideña porque ya no me quedan días!
5338 2018-11-29 16:04:31 เดี๋ยวววว ซีรีย์เรื่องล่าสุดนี่ เป็นตัวร้ายเบาๆ แต่ฉากจูบรัวๆเลยนะ 
5339 2018-11-29 16:04:20 As in ehhhnn. Rough play abi smooth based on the oil 
5340 2018-11-29 16:04:20 Vladdy wants trump to go into Iraq. He wants their oil. Then Venezuela.
5341 2018-11-29 16:04:10 Ladies, if he:

- Posts Snapchat stories as Chef Bill
- Buys your Student Tickets 
- Tells you he has Oil Money 
- Whips that flow

5342 2018-11-29 16:04:04 I hope all Canadians are seeing that Alberta is trying to make it better for all oil and gas workers.
5343 2018-11-29 16:04:04 Heating oil just doesn't want to play.
5344 2018-11-29 16:03:53 Nobody else should have a VT that lasts forever besides Necalli. Maybe VT1 Gives him access to cancelling into oil or something, so he can still oil and get oki.
5345 2018-11-29 16:03:51 Tell me how I went to Walmart to buy more Argon Oil but when I left not only did I forget to buy it but I instead left with 3 packs of cookie dough
5346 2018-11-29 16:03:41 I’m already noticing good changes in my skin with these evening primrose oil supplements combined with my skin care routine.
5347 2018-11-29 16:03:31 Friend, oil and gas are also subsidized
5348 2018-11-29 16:03:15 Experts & economists said $ will reach 100 & oil would be 100 $ sooner than later in early October! That was quite reassuring! Most Experts in media or Economists basically get it wrong each and every time! My 30 year observation!
5349 2018-11-29 16:03:00 He’s a liar. Our oil production is booming IN SPITE of Obama. He did everything he could to curtail production on federal lands. Where the boom occurred was on state owned lands.
5350 2018-11-29 16:02:49 shit...he even has the same nose
5351 2018-11-29 16:02:46 - I’m sending you thoughts and prayers....
5352 2018-11-29 16:02:42 How ridiculous is war. Millions of innocent people die, and for what? For the Elite to obtain gold, oil, and money? Absolute joke that people still defend the need to fight when in reality, if everyone refused, there would be no wars.

5355 2018-11-29 16:02:27 be careful out there driving today socal ppl! the first day of heavy rain causes all the oil to come up onto the streets, making the road slippery!!!! be mindful of the roads today

5357 2018-11-29 16:02:25 Adulting is googling coupons for an oil change
5358 2018-11-29 16:02:19 Ppl incorrectly focused on oil w/ no appreciation for inflation accelerating amidst an economic slowdown... History shows this can and has happened before (hence @RayDalio 1930s analogy). Populism, Tariffs, Immigration, Inflation, Deficit Spending, CB Tightening all analogous!
5359 2018-11-29 16:02:15 Technology,..& plenty has made us this Pompous,..the heaviest rainfall we've had in awhile,there would be dances,& celebration centuries ago,now folks just cautious on oil sleeked roads. #LARain

I know, I know, it's oil from Canada. 

It just illustrates Obama's true desire that oil stay in the ground.
5361 2018-11-29 16:02:04 The Clyde nukes will be the decider for any deal. We tell them tae gtf out Scotland and leave our oil, or we fuck the nukes up so they cant use them(they cant use them anyway but thats a moot point)

5364 2018-11-29 16:01:52 Read to comprehend before answering, I clearly stated tree things as courses of their economic decline and you just stuck your brain around sanctions. Oil is not the only natural resource economies survive on, SA has it's own resources and doesn't rely on it's resources solely

ㅤㅤWelp!
5369 2018-11-29 16:01:37 Because Oshawa is the federal government's fault? How do you explain that several plants in the U.S. were shut down too? Perhaps if Alberta diversified its economy and didn't rely on a volatile product like oil, perhaps the numbers would fluctuate less. 1/2

5386 2018-11-29 16:00:11 I'm fairly sure taking CBD oil has saved me this semester so far, instead of feeling like ripping my hair out for deadlines, I now procrastinate endlessly and quite possibly don't stress out enough. Progress? Idk

5388 2018-11-29 16:00:04 Oil drilling and production increased despite his best efforts to stop it with regulation. The production was done on private land using  fracking. Wasn’t he the one who said we can’t drill our way out of high oil prices. I guess he was wrong.
5389 2018-11-29 15:59:54 Past two weeks I’ve had so much pressure in my third eye, please tell me someone has relief, I’ve tried lavender oil on my temples, ive tried baths, I’ve tried medication for it, I’ve tried smoking weed but nothing is relieving it
5390 2018-11-29 15:59:53 Same in the UK! A supermarket chain stated they'd stop using palm oil completely & was praised,but campaigners fear it might lead to a worse situation for forests.

It's a difficult thing to process,maybe easier to boycott? 
But currently good to support *real* sustainable p oil.

5400 2018-11-29 15:59:13 Yes, Nordstream 2 will be transacted in euros.  The Russian oil/gas majors have issued a lot of euro-denominated debt since 2015 after paying off their USD-denominated debt.

5409 2018-11-29 15:58:29 It's not just about costs. Shale producers can adapt to price changes quickly and access large sums of capital for hedging and debt service. For large scale oil producers like Russia it costs a lot to shut down or scale back production.
5410 2018-11-29 15:58:29 Wait till the OIL deals leaks !

But hey he’s let women drive and he has a post -oil plan. 
And Billions
5413 2018-11-29 15:58:19 Being in a relationship with a mechanic is the most underrated thing in the world. Need an oil change? Calls bae. Need tires? Calls bae. Wanna buy a used car but don't know shit? Calls bae.
5414 2018-11-29 15:58:14 He’s insane I work in the oil industry and we went through years of hell under Obama. The oil industry flourished in spite of Obama’s policies.
5415 2018-11-29 15:58:12 Obama is taking credit for U.S boom in oil production. No more edibles for you, Barry
5416 2018-11-29 15:58:10 Very impressed to hear @IcelandRichard explaining @IcelandFoods has intelligent, nuanced approach. Isn’t calling for crude ban. Understands need for genuine, sustainable palm oil. #CIPRConf18

5422 2018-11-29 15:57:37 Isn't this a failure of Big Oil ? Every company I buy from has to transport their product. Why doesn't that apppy to the highly subsidized Big Oil ? #cdnpoli
5423 2018-11-29 15:57:35 Everyday or every two days depending on how dry my hair is or what I feel like.I know it seems like a lot but I use only a little of each product. Leave in+cream+oil is really all you need. Google LCO method.
5424 2018-11-29 15:57:32 Did Bushes give up their oil? Did OB give up his Hollywood offers? Did Regan refuse his Hollywood royalties? Did Clinton give up his Real State deals? Did Jimmy Carter give up his Peanuts? I remember.
5425 2018-11-29 15:57:28 Yea thank  you Republican  party.   The  backwards  drill baby  drill  climate  change is a hoax  money  in your pockets from  the oil  companies.   Good  job thanks

5433 2018-11-29 15:57:00 its more the Elite Elites. They know oil and poluting was a problem forever, they just like money more. We should have listen to the Native Americans a little bit at least!
5434 2018-11-29 15:56:57 Totally fair, & you would want car dealers to appear as an option in the SERP. However, Purolator shipping >>> Purolator oil here, and people are showing up at car dealerships ready to pick up or deliver packages because the car dealer's knowledge panel appears.
5435 2018-11-29 15:56:55 @JustinTrudeau if mr. trump doesn't want to play fair, how about we shut off the oil, gas, power, and Canadian borders, then let them starve in the dark while they freeze. By the way, I know a lot of welders who wouldn't mind building trump's wall, at the Canadian Border.
5436 2018-11-29 15:56:55 Whoa...are we talking oil segregationist policies here?

The amount of train traffic now is sometimes unbearable. But I guess it's something. Hopefully short term
5442 2018-11-29 15:56:26 If ya oil is black they didn’t change it Ms. Independent. Either way go back and make them reset it. It’s a part of the job
5443 2018-11-29 15:56:24 NONE! who the F is buying Canadian oil/gas? You would have to be compeletly out of touch with what is going on in the sector. I guess you can be like Joe Fraud & load up on $bte calls for DEC. He was the only one buying, Hahaha, like to know that loss. Cant make that shit up!
5444 2018-11-29 15:56:24 You have to want your next level as bad as you want that next breath.  There's a price for the oil.

5448 2018-11-29 15:56:03 Yes that is why Putin hates you, Obama. It emptied his coffers when we became the world’s largest oil producer.
5449 2018-11-29 15:56:02 They don’t need to stop the arms sale that would cost Canadians more money, just stop importing there oil, damn some people are brain dead!!!
5450 2018-11-29 15:56:01 Trump: got oil lower, stopped the S&P slide, is close to a deal with China because they are waving the white flag, has the dollar bid because USA is the place to invest, will meet with Putin or MBS, and will shut the US border if necessary.  

Media: MICHAEL COHEN or something.
5451 2018-11-29 15:56:01 Al Gore is an oil rich buffoon.
5452 2018-11-29 15:56:01 Even better, Canada should build a refinery for the Alberta bitumen and stop buying oil from Saudi Arabia completely.
5453 2018-11-29 15:55:53 This oil and oil equities move is so nasty. Still think a couple more funds gotta blow out positions next week so watching

5456 2018-11-29 15:55:34 @JustinTrudeau  The Oshawa plant closing is unfortunate, and you are right to look to give the displaced workers help. Where is this support for the 100,000 oil workers in Alberta BC and Saskatchewan who've lost their jobs and barely recieved any news attention, let alone support
5457 2018-11-29 15:55:29 Muy buena cuenta! Doblada indeed.

5460 2018-11-29 15:55:12 Moving the oil by rail or truck isnt reducing emissions compares to moving it by pipe.
5461 2018-11-29 15:55:06 Why do we even listen to that snake oil salesman, Trump? He can't even remember his own lies. What a big sham and mistake the U.S. has made by letting corruption rule.
5462 2018-11-29 15:55:05 The expression “data is the new oil” is a fine metaphor since it implies that the crude oil (data) must be refined to extract something useful, e.g., improved situational awareness

If tariffs work the way you think, and send money "pouring into our coffers," why don't you place tariffs on every barrel of foreign oil?

5467 2018-11-29 15:54:38 So-called influencers are the snake oil salesmen of today. Nothing more than narcissists so insecure that they must channel all their energy into imposing their "brand" onto impressionable people's lives.  I pity them & those taken in by them, because it's all worthless.
5468 2018-11-29 15:54:30 i can go for some cardboard n motor oil right about now

5471 2018-11-29 15:54:26 What is this knowledge builder nonsense from the FT? An article about a jam company missing guidance is 249 points, but a special report about Nigerian oil law reform is 45?
5472 2018-11-29 15:54:25 He is upset that we won;t buy into his lies! How utterly ridiculous! I never bought into this charletan! Never have! Never will! 
Thank you @POTUS for Our Booming Economy and the US becoming the World's Top Oil Producer! Finally, a President who puts #AmericaFirst!
5473 2018-11-29 15:54:24 What concerns me, (if Trump did indeed convince SA to lower oil prices) is how he did it. By ignoring Kashoggi's murder?  As for Fox bot tweeting, I didnt notice that but it is odd.
5474 2018-11-29 15:54:06 I respect that supporters defend their idol but history will show Harper’s epic failure will haunt Alberta for a generation.  Harper had 9 years in office and could not build a single pipe line to the West Coast freeing Alberta oil. That level of incompetence is hard to fathom
5475 2018-11-29 15:53:50 I thought they did packaging. Let me look them up. I would like to do internship at a cooking oil manufacturing plant. Fingers crossed.
5476 2018-11-29 15:53:34 Tried a Ole Henrikson one...jelly to oil then to milk when water is added, it was nice..but I prefer a balm type myself!
5477 2018-11-29 15:53:34 Honestly! Amazing.. close your eyes though... only put a pea size amount in... plus Obas oil in a bath!!xx
5478 2018-11-29 15:53:32 I would accept Obama's claims about the oil business if he took credit for all the scandals during his administration.

5481 2018-11-29 15:53:22 Finally found the oil to prevent my gorilla snot from flaking 
5482 2018-11-29 15:53:20 How much government money should we throw at making the Big Five oil companies wealthy?  Cuz, as far as I can see, Albertans and Canadians will see very little of it, no matter what the price.  Anwehttps://www.policyalternatives.ca/publications/reports/boom-bust-and-consolidation
5483 2018-11-29 15:53:10 She’s likely responsible for the oil production, economy, unemployment and not having anyone on her campaign indicted, too.
5484 2018-11-29 15:53:10 We are still the number one oil producer in the world, according to BHO.
5485 2018-11-29 15:53:02 Interest me in your story please... 
5486 2018-11-29 15:52:59 Stop buying oil from them! Use our own!!
5487 2018-11-29 15:52:58 Yes! I can’t speak for all their products but I’m currently using their glow oil together with their ivory butter and I must say I’m in love with the combo.
5488 2018-11-29 15:52:57 I wanted to purchase hybrid vehicles but they are not available for the XL models :-(. Yes, I opposed Mr. Harper’s move to export US coal through Vancouver Ports. Study  difference between oil and “bitumen”. Latter cannot be cleaned up. Devastating for the Beautiful West Coast.
5489 2018-11-29 15:52:55 HI!! Yea first walk done! Boo  NY is f*#ing cold. Hope the tea tree oil is working for ya

5491 2018-11-29 15:52:49 Life on the old dusty trail is rough, too much cowpoke-on-cowpoke crime these days. Pouring out some snake oil for the pardners.
5492 2018-11-29 15:52:46 Nope...good compression socks are not cheap. Mine are about $35 a pair but make a world of difference. After a 12hr shift, I also hit a hot water Epsom salt soak for 20-30 min followed by hemp massage and compression boots for 20-30 min. 30mg CBD oil and melatonin...and done!
5493 2018-11-29 15:52:46 Most of the important stuff in life is boring.  Walking the fencelines, checking the oil, paying the bills.  Here’s to a few more boring people and a few less rockstars.  We need a bazillion boring people for every creative genius.
5494 2018-11-29 15:52:35 Ummmm nope! Anyone with a brain can check where their stocks were you moron. Most people let others do that for them, and can get a spreadsheet made up to disprove your claim. Oil? Really? Let me put it this way. Trump is the only president to date that can influence stocks.
5495 2018-11-29 15:52:19 No. Fried bread is just a slice of bread fried in oil until it's crisp and brown. It's just a bit to oily for me, it's better cooked in animal fat but not to many places use it anymore.
5496 2018-11-29 15:52:18 Face oil dlu.
5497 2018-11-29 15:52:09 I bet those horse drawn carriage people said the exact same thing. And the whale oil lamp people...

5501 2018-11-29 15:51:50 I don't C OPEC cutting enough & demand rest of world cut too. This will put downward pressure on oil. If $XOM heads to $73 range great buy
5502 2018-11-29 15:51:49 wait, so you DON'T put motor oil on your pancakes? O_O
5503 2018-11-29 15:51:41 Shouldn't GAS be $1.50 a gallon like it was the last time oil was $50 a barrel?
5504 2018-11-29 15:51:40 Fair enough gents. I’m an eternal optimist (generally) no question we see things happen that shouldn’t, or where we’d expect not to see them. I’m not sold that it’s a coaching issue. Just might be the players aren’t good enough. We tend to succeed when everyone is playing 100

5507 2018-11-29 15:51:37 I make a blend of several kinds of oils – including frankincense and melaleuca – and use it as a facial oil  There's only a couple drops of the essential oils because they're STRONG, so it's mostly super moisturizing carrier oils

5509 2018-11-29 15:51:33 My daughter, who studied in Italy, has always maintained that it was physically impossible for Italy to grow that many tomatoes for export since the locally grown ones are all eaten by Italians. See also olive oil, Italian fashion, shoes etc
5510 2018-11-29 15:51:30 Open the mouse, clean any dead skin, etc. on the wheel mechanism, as well you can put on some oil to loosen it a little.

5517 2018-11-29 15:51:02 ... meaning the 2nd most from oil companies. Terrible news. Sorry for the mistake.
5518 2018-11-29 15:50:57 I need this groundnut oil too 
5519 2018-11-29 15:50:53 Leftist criticisms of Rachel Notley: "Violates indigenous sovereignty. Undermines climate change goals. Refuses to tax during economic boon, maintaining oil dependence."

Conservatives: "she ate a baby and personally burned down my dog"

Seems absolutely petty and empty for Albertans to respond to the GM news with "oh yeah?" What about #Oil? Huh?"

Tragedy one-upmanship is unpleasant. Would prefer not.
5525 2018-11-29 15:50:36 Big problem. Global growth including in the US is suffering from these tarrifs.  Also your low oil price policy will kill shale making it uneconomical. Let's watch that US rig count fall. I appreciate they are leaner than before but are they lean enough?...at WTI $45? Less?....

5536 2018-11-29 15:49:44 Selling oil in euro?!?!
5537 2018-11-29 15:49:44 Them don clear your doubt
5538 2018-11-29 15:49:42 That'll throw the Saudis into chaos. What is the point of this insignificant move when Canada continues to purchase oil valued at 100's of millions of dollars at world prices from this regime? This country is fast becoming comic relief for the rest of the world.
5539 2018-11-29 15:49:37 Body oil, I think o:
5540 2018-11-29 15:49:34 So I'm curious what policies President Trump put in place in 2010 and 2011 to cause a rapid growth in oil production to get us where we're at today

when 60 caps of weed oil eaten in 2 months or less has over a 90% success
5542 2018-11-29 15:49:29 Federal exploration and drilling permits on federally controlled lands and off the coasts saw an 11 percent drop. Increases in exploration for new oil reserves and drilling occurred on private lands in which the federal government has no control.
5543 2018-11-29 15:49:29 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
5544 2018-11-29 15:49:26 Oil executives probably think so.

5547 2018-11-29 15:49:14 Cheap oil and by extension cheaper gas just means more people buying impossibly large trucks and suvs and making it even more impossible to see past them and more idiots who can't get their vehicle between the lines of a parking space

5551 2018-11-29 15:48:56 That is ridiculous! Of what benefit to America is it to make stuff up about shale oil reserves? It distorts the future and  is counterproductive to conservation and reserve management. It also gives knotheads in Washington the dumb idea we can dominate the world with $40 LTO.
5552 2018-11-29 15:48:46 It’s too cold to get out of bed and I’m supposed to be at my oil change in 10 LMAO
5553 2018-11-29 15:48:44 According to trump and his base  this is why it was ok to chop up a journalist and as far as I’m concerned if you support trump your just as much complacent in this murder all in the name of lower oil prices which by the way we don’t even get 20 percent from Saudi Arabia
5554 2018-11-29 15:48:40 What is the outlook of the Nigerian economy beyond 2018 ?How far can the @cenbank  continually defend the Naira in the face of huge uncertainty and economic despair lurking ? Oil prices going southwards @BBoason
5555 2018-11-29 15:48:32 U.S.  oil production, particularly from light sweet crude oil grades, has rapidly increased since 2011. Much of the recent growth has occurred in areas such as the Permian region in western Texas and eastern New Mexico, the Federal Offshore Gulf of Mexico, and the Bakken region

5560 2018-11-29 15:48:05 Reminds me of Facebook, too. And the Oil Companies.
5561 2018-11-29 15:48:05 It's "STANDARD OIL"
5562 2018-11-29 15:48:01 During his time the oil price got almost around $140 per barrel and most domestic oil companies shutdown their oil rigs more than any administration who took over the White House.
5563 2018-11-29 15:47:58 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.
5564 2018-11-29 15:47:40 @TheBodyShopUK How is your palm oil certified sustainable??
5565 2018-11-29 15:47:34 Wrote about this roughly 10 days ago in one of my pieces but had Rattie in Puljujarvi's spot, as the kid was still in AHL. Completely agree that Spooner isn't very good but if he's not being used in a spot where he can produce offence, why the hell was he acquired.
5566 2018-11-29 15:47:32 Oil change is needed but idk where to go 
5567 2018-11-29 15:47:28 I forgot to put beard oil on today and this is my excuse to go buy more than what I really need because I like to smell like fresh sawdust

5571 2018-11-29 15:47:20 I WONDER JUST HOW MUCH OIL HE HAS IN BODY ??????
5572 2018-11-29 15:47:19 @cafreeland In addition to these Saudi sanctions as they relate to Khashoggi's  murder, will Canada also going to stop importing Saudi oil? Where do you stand on this?  #onpoli @Canada @JustinTrudeau
5573 2018-11-29 15:47:18 When you realize they put motor oil on your pancakes instead of syrup.
5574 2018-11-29 15:47:12 Here’s the problem though. As the US produced more oil, the prices drop. As prices drop and gasoline at the pump drops, consumers are shifting to bigger trucks and leaving cars. As car sales drop, auto companies quit producing cars and lay off workers. Tariffs are only an excuse.
5575 2018-11-29 15:47:11 Where is Carter Page?  The whole Gazprom Rosneft thing should be coming out soon too. Russia seizing Ukrainian ships in Sea of Azov receiving tacit approval from Trump. Why?  Trump obsessed w/oil & gas, Russia obsessed w/delivery routes for same. Was there a deal?

5577 2018-11-29 15:47:02 @khara_sach1 Umar Asad is incompetent man. Now, reportedly instead of decreasing oil prices, they are going to increase as the tax is increased from 4% to 17%. Plz check witj AO
5578 2018-11-29 15:46:52 Oil added to the earth dream engine, how to solve the problem?
5579 2018-11-29 15:46:49 Who got oil? I’m finna put that shit in my juul and just get smacked off that. I’m reaching new heights lmao
5580 2018-11-29 15:46:49 The @CPC_HQ did nothing for the oil sands when bitumen was selling for $100/barrel. You are in no position to criticize this government or any other. The only party doing something constructive is the @albertaNDP and @RachelNotley . Conservatives have historically done nothing!
5581 2018-11-29 15:46:46 The Russians can sell oil profitably at $20 a barrel.  The euro is going to crash to parity with the dollar if not lower.  We cannot outcompete the Russians on oil production costs.  They have almost no dollar liabilities and half a billion in foreign exchange reserves.
5582 2018-11-29 15:46:42 #Russia is becoming increasingly convinced it needs to reduce oil output in tandem with #OPEC but is still bargaining with the producer group’s leader, #Saudi Arabia, over the timing and volume of any reduction,
5583 2018-11-29 15:46:42 Palm oil?
5584 2018-11-29 15:46:41 I used to hate the analogy that “data is the oil of the 21st century”, but the more I think about it, the more apt it becomes. Data as a business model is inherently extractive, creates massive negative externalities, and can be uniquely, dangerously profitable.
5585 2018-11-29 15:46:27 Am not sure if truly this your PhD is genuine.a reminder your hero Goodluck Ebele Jonathan and his cousin sold our country oil % gas offshore in Nigeria with the aid of Eni and Shell and scooped $6n from the sale which was meant to enter the country account.
5586 2018-11-29 15:46:27 EU cant. We are dependant on Russian gas and oil. There is no other possibility as the US liquid  gas is 4x more expensive and thats the cheapest alternative.
5587 2018-11-29 15:46:26 そんなもんよ
考えすぎるのもよろしくないぞ
5588 2018-11-29 15:46:21 Keep trying to sell that snake oil. Americans know the truth.
5589 2018-11-29 15:46:19 胃だけに？
5590 2018-11-29 15:46:09 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, or illegal overstays.
5591 2018-11-29 15:45:59 Between 1972, the year before the first oil crisis and 1979 when the IMF were at the door, UK GDP fell 13%. Was this the result of joining the EU, or due to external factors? The world knows the answer to that. The old adage There are lies, damn lies and statistics comes to mind.
5592 2018-11-29 15:45:57 Where is this? Also they lowered the oil price as a result of the backlash for that journalist they killed. None of this was trump
5593 2018-11-29 15:45:56 Who knew all of those regulations and stopping pipelines from being installed could help produce oil.
5594 2018-11-29 15:45:44 See you haven't been paying attention to the tariffs and trade wars. Or US national security issues. 
The US is now the largest producer of oil in the world thanks to Trump. Trump is doing his best to get companies to come back to the US.
5595 2018-11-29 15:45:25 So apparently slathering coconut oil all over the skin is the best way to stay cold on top of the mountain? Like blubber for seals.

5598 2018-11-29 15:45:06 From a follower: I needed to go down Morgan and it is closed between Touby Pike and 250 E. They are putting fresh oil down.
5599 2018-11-29 15:45:02 No bruh it's actually spicy oil.

5602 2018-11-29 15:44:45 why are Canadian "journalists" questioning selling the Saudis arms?? They should be asking why we keep buying their oil??!!!! so pathetic

5611 2018-11-29 15:43:50 Obama basically took liberals brains and turned them inside out.  He's the greatest snake oil salesman in U.S. history.   The psychological deception is so deep some may never recover.

 The only relevant qualification on Twitter is follower count.
5615 2018-11-29 15:43:24 Keep telling yourself that . 
Oil money is not club revenue , 
Diving and faking injury is not football , my children play tougher than that , and you’ll get no tears from us just your players when the wind blows them over ... 
5616 2018-11-29 15:43:23 The Oil Price is going to change. Social costs of Saudi Arabia are past on to whoever buy their oil. Military defense costs will increase not decrease from here. When the barrel price falls the above costs remain, the gap is not going to be filled by opening or closing of a valve
5617 2018-11-29 15:43:19 Just got a free oil change hell yeah!

5620 2018-11-29 15:43:16 All of which is true. It’s not snake oil. But one needs to be highly careful on what they take and from whom. A big issue is that most doctors know little to nothing about it
5621 2018-11-29 15:43:16 Didn't Obama take credit for the Oil Boom in the US yesterday? Hmmm I thought he was all about climate change... I guess we are getting gored again.
5622 2018-11-29 15:43:14 Sana oil
5623 2018-11-29 15:43:09 We are a super rich Oil and gas Nation. It is the job of pastors to preach and expand the Gospel of Christ. That of Government we elect by a popular vote to provide jobs and manage the economy. Let's not misapply responsibility.
5624 2018-11-29 15:43:07 This is a paid lobbyist on behalf of oil producers.  Believe him or the consensus of the vast majority of scientists?  Do you want to bet your children's lives on it?  Cuz that's what's at stake.
5625 2018-11-29 15:43:05 @djsliming and @kooSebor is on with #DryveOnY ,tune in now.. Feeling the vibes inside Champion Oil @Asonomaso-nkwanta.
5626 2018-11-29 15:42:56 Huckabee is nothing more than a dishonest snake oil salesman, peddling lies to the american people. He gives Christians a bad name
5627 2018-11-29 15:42:53 They just use that for the commericals to make it look better  theres not actually engine oil and cardboard in them
5628 2018-11-29 15:42:52 oil below 60?
5629 2018-11-29 15:42:46 Getting away from an actual trade deficit, if I need to get $10 a pound for my polished rocks, and they can be bought from china for $8, I'm in the fix competitors of standard oil were in way back. About all I can do is sell below cost and sell equipment, then they go to $12.
5630 2018-11-29 15:42:45 Women and being ready on time is like oil in water. That shit don’t mix.
5631 2018-11-29 15:42:44 Ok @BarackObama I will... thank u @realDonaldTrump for making the US the largest oil producer and for the stock prices compared to when Obama left office
5632 2018-11-29 15:42:37 Says the person who is using a device made from crude oil to tweet this very ignorant tweet!
5633 2018-11-29 15:42:36 So if he is responsible for American oil production,  why doesn't he take credit for destabilizing the Middle East & the resulting creation of ISIS? Take credit where it is due, the destabilization of the Middle East, worst since WW2. All on Obama & Company.
5634 2018-11-29 15:42:34 Okay. There is a cute guy sitting in front of me now (don’t worry mukha naman siyang of legal age) MY FACE LOOKS LIKE AN OIL DEPOSIT 
5635 2018-11-29 15:42:34 The Bush family maintained their oil businesses while in office; in fact, they were partnered with Bin Ladens & Saudis. The Clintons & Obamas are magically billionaires! Pres. Trump divested from his company to be President; but yes, he's made global real estate deals. So what?
5636 2018-11-29 15:42:31 Use Bio oil
5637 2018-11-29 15:42:28 @ChrisCuomo so since barry sotoro obama has claimed to be the ‘largest producer if oil’, does that mean he was also the largest contributor to global warming?  interested to see how degenerates at @cnn spin this. Prob wont touch it tho
5638 2018-11-29 15:42:23 So are you sanctioning Notley's death trains? And will you take responsibility when they become an environmental disaster? And can we sue Alberta when it all goes wrong and Oil gets dumped on unsuspecting towns? U spew a lot but U have 0 viable solutions! #ScheerNonsense
5639 2018-11-29 15:42:19 .@StateDept special rep. for Iran #BrianHook: 80 percent of Iran's export earnings come from oil exports. "Many more barrels will be coming off very soon." Urges EU to impose missile sanctions.
5640 2018-11-29 15:42:08 And yet we continue to buy their oil and sell them weapons so they can continue their brutal slaughter of innocents. 
This is the definition of bare minimum and we should be ashamed.
5641 2018-11-29 15:41:58 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
5642 2018-11-29 15:41:58 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Pittsburgh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
5643 2018-11-29 15:41:53 We have at least 2 lawsuits prepared, which I personally helped to fund.
5644 2018-11-29 15:41:51 Thank you Mr. Obama for helping America become a booming economy and the top oil producer.  Only you could have done this.  If you hadn't left the Oval office, we still would be at the bottom of the oil producing heap.

5651 2018-11-29 15:41:42 Just better keep an eye on him. He's another snake oil salesman. Former fsu players as a whole don't care much for him.
5652 2018-11-29 15:41:38 I’m not an Obama fan but my company works in the oil fields and he did do much for oil exploration and production. He might be right that he did continue what Bush started. USA oil independance
5653 2018-11-29 15:41:37 Unless the plan is to move the oil by rail to Eastern Canada or the West Coast, I don’t understand how this helps our situation. Sending more oil to the US so it can be sold at a huge discount makes no sense.
5654 2018-11-29 15:41:28 Sitting here with a 2.5 hour wait to get my oil change. Last time I got one at Soapy Joes in Chula Vista I was in and out within 20 minutes 
5655 2018-11-29 15:41:21 Mas com Oil e Iron ore em baixa, adivinha como será a inflação no proximo trimestre ?
5656 2018-11-29 15:41:17 What percentage of Nigeria's govt (FG, State & Local Govt) REVENUE was approximately contributed by OIL in 2017?

P.S. We will provide the answer tomorrow and our proof in an Infographic.

5658 2018-11-29 15:41:07 Placing a tiny bit of oil into the pan, and makes sure that the oil reaches to the edges of the pan.

Carefully but skillfully took the two eggs and cracked them on top of the pan.

“Ok, ok.” He whispered to himself.
5659 2018-11-29 15:40:59 $2.85 here and diesel is $3.15. Hasn't dropped more than $0.10 since oil started tanking. We're the only state in the union without a refinery. I worked on planning and siting one several years ago, never got very far and hasn't been heard of since.
5660 2018-11-29 15:40:51 If you stop looking at this as incompetence and look at it as intentional destruction of the Oil and Gas sector, all the pieces will fit into place.
5661 2018-11-29 15:40:50 vitamin e oil works miracles for scars and stretch marks
5662 2018-11-29 15:40:39 Are Dems putting nation at risk over their hatred for Trump? xxx You're saying to move into the future with the rest of the educated world is wrong? Trump has earn our contempt with his stupidity and desire to take us back to the past...Coal, Oil, Steel, outdated manufacturing?
5663 2018-11-29 15:40:36 But remember he brought the oil industry back to America! Ogh
5664 2018-11-29 15:40:31  it is getting monotonous Chris, our oil, whisky, gin, water, that is what’s precious other than that, they don't give a Toss.
5665 2018-11-29 15:40:30 Here’s the problem though. As the US produced more oil, the prices drop. As prices drop and gasoline at the pump drops, consumers are shifting to bigger trucks and leaving cars. As car sales drop, auto companies quit producing cars and lay off workers. Tariffs are only an excuse.

5667 2018-11-29 15:40:21 Cause the tar blocks off the small holes on the leaves and this makes it so that the tree cant breathe and it dies off. And co2 is already warm but the stuff oil and coal produces is even warmer and cause it cant be filtered it stays there until
5668 2018-11-29 15:40:19 @Asad_Umar Oil prices fall below $50 & Govt is planning to increase the price. I hope Govt wakes up & start taking some common man supporting decisions.

5672 2018-11-29 15:40:10 No. It will simply return to the $3.00 per barrel price that it was at the day before the 1973 Arab Oil Embargo. I feel young, again!

5675 2018-11-29 15:40:06 It’s great to be excited about getting a car, lots of freedom & memories are going to be made.    And then you have to get the oil change, oh and there goes your battery, wait what’s that  noise?!?! Uh-oh here’s renewal time, better pay those car taxes!!! MONEY, WHATS THAT?! 
5676 2018-11-29 15:40:03 So I'm curious what policies President Trump put in place in 2010 and 2011 to cause the rapid increase of oil production that got us to where we're at today
5677 2018-11-29 15:40:00 One would think this crisis would spur some kind of push into more sustainable energy production. Alberta trying to revive an industry that’s damaging the world over is backwards. This is not the time to be revving up oil sands extraction.
5678 2018-11-29 15:39:57 Why is no one giving President Trump credit for low oil and gas prices !?!?
5679 2018-11-29 15:39:48 It's fine to say we need to slow down our acceptance of refugees and asylum seekers, but when will he address what is causing this. Like endless stupid immoral wars. That sadly Canada has participated in. We support terrorism when we buy Saudi oil for instance.
5680 2018-11-29 15:39:44 That would be pretty sweet.
5681 2018-11-29 15:39:35 Mistakes would have been fine.  Obstruction, stalking, lies, corruption, not so much.  Oil people.
5682 2018-11-29 15:39:34 So does an oil sheen. It looks fantastic, until you know what produced it.
5683 2018-11-29 15:39:27 So we all at Walmart trying to get an oil change and there isn’t even an employee here to help us out  so a guy tried leaving but they gotta open the door for us 
5684 2018-11-29 15:39:27 Says the man who blocked major oil pipelines and reduced oil production, fracking and over regulated related businesses as well as spending billions on bailing out GM to focus on electric autos! Liar.
5685 2018-11-29 15:39:26 G’oil!
5686 2018-11-29 15:39:26 Might not work for migraines, but peppermint oil on my temples works for my headaches
5687 2018-11-29 15:39:25 ชอบ
5688 2018-11-29 15:39:23 Such nonsense. Name one policy Obama enacted to help fossil fuel production. He did everything he could to lower production thru overregulation. Pres Trump’s dereg is responsible for the U.S. oil boom.
5689 2018-11-29 15:39:20 Is the oil thick ?
5690 2018-11-29 15:39:18 When your face is plastered in flesh-tinted mineral oil the tape doesn't stick.
5691 2018-11-29 15:39:11 I had to take oil painting classes all 4 years at my school. I was so happy when I was finally able to take digital art classes.
5692 2018-11-29 15:39:11 U.S. oil production, particularly from light sweet crude oil grades, has rapidly increased since 2011. Much of the recent growth has occurred in areas such as the Permian region in western Texas and eastern New Mexico, the Federal Offshore Gulf of Mexico, and the Bakken region

5697 2018-11-29 15:38:53 The Bush dynasty made their fortunes off of getting entire countries addicted. That's how they made their fortune before oil.

5700 2018-11-29 15:38:16 Seems Notley has matured and realises that oil has to be moved..she’s buying rail card to help move it. And as usual,The feds are too busy hemming and hawing,to get anything done

5703 2018-11-29 15:38:04 I think Boaking Bob's, the chippy where I lived in Scotland, did that.

Might have been his special. With a tub of what looked like the weeks-old oil he fried everything in on the side, which he called "gravy."

Yeah, don't have that.

Have chips and cheese with a buttered roll.
5704 2018-11-29 15:37:56 Mary is lucky. Mary found an open field in Colorado without an oil & gas horizontally-fracked multi-well pad.
5705 2018-11-29 15:37:55 It was always going to be worse than the current deal, best they could get in 2+ years too, how long you want to flog that dead horse. Sounding like a snake oil salesman on full sales pitch...

5718 2018-11-29 15:36:41 It’s currently set to be “crazy” because oil & gas lobbyists are still influencing way too much. Alternatives need real funding to work. Could you imagine Henry Ford building Model Ts, but the horse & carriage society allowed only a handful of gas stations be built?

5721 2018-11-29 15:36:33 Might fuck around and actually put motor oil on my pancakes
5722 2018-11-29 15:36:16 Oil is broken. It has fallen 35% from its high in last 8 wks. It can bounce here but no way its going to higher highs in a market melt-up,not even close. There's a lot more downside ahead in the next yr.I wouldn't be putting money into energy stocks now. Much better opportunities
5723 2018-11-29 15:36:16 Liberals suffer from internal and historical inconsistencies.  Under Bush years it was "war for oil, CIA lies, and government spies on it's own citizens."  Now liberals are totally for war, CIA is gospel, and government would never spy on it's own citizens.

5740 2018-11-29 15:34:51 His self centered arrogance is real disgusting to watch ! Now if he had really been the reason oil production went up , then if he acted this way it would be Ok !!! Even though he boastful proclaiming it!Trump tells you what he’s done,but not arrogantly 
5741 2018-11-29 15:34:43 I wish I could see the reaction of all Trump supporters that are now realizing that they have been: suckered, bamboozled, by the biggest snake oil salesman of their lifetime. Know that there is new life at the end of this dark tunnel.

5762 2018-11-29 15:33:21 Nice thought but not until you stop using palm oil in your products I’m not adding to any animals suffering 
5763 2018-11-29 15:33:18 I'm still waiting on the truth on the BP oil spill which allowed Obama to shut down drilling...but he gave US money to Brazil to drill.  Redistribution of tax dollars.
5764 2018-11-29 15:33:18 Climate Change is Real! Now watch as I produce more oil and fossil fuels than ever before in US history! Climate Change is REAL! This is a fine example of a politicians talking out both sides of his mouth but climate change is real! Hold my beer while I frack this oil...
5765 2018-11-29 15:33:13 imagine Jonathan and his cousin John Atete fraudulently sold Niger Delta gas offshore with the help of Eni & Shell to an oil company secretly owned by Atete and scooped $6bn . The fool is writing Transition Hour when he is suppose to be Jail.
5766 2018-11-29 15:33:11 Nope. I'm not even remotely started, other than one present bought on a whim. I have zero Christmas interest this year. I can just see my frantic last-minute shopping. Motor oil and protein bars for all!
5767 2018-11-29 15:32:57 US production generally goes up when oil price goes up, right?

Does that mean green policies increase oil costs, hurting those consumers who don't hold shares of US oil companies?

5770 2018-11-29 15:32:50 Doña Michetti habló en "lengue d'oíl" un francés del siglo X que dió origen al occitano y todas las lenguas galas , si Macron no entendió no tenemos culpa de su ignorancia, pero asi de cultos somos.
5771 2018-11-29 15:32:48 Then rupee depreciating, oil price surged.
5772 2018-11-29 15:32:47 truth is the rise in oil production during his 8 years had nothing to do with the feds... States like Texas, Oregon, Colorado and others had to work around him to get more oil production. He tied their hands with a load of regulations... Such lies!

5782 2018-11-29 15:32:04 It's not either/or. Paul Manafort owed Oleg Deripaska so much money he sued him. There are court documents. Rick Gates, Michael Flynn, Rudy Giuliani, all have investments in Russian oil development.

5786 2018-11-29 15:31:51 World oil prices are fine. It's just Alberta's that is low. Due to no pipeline , which yes I 100% can and should blame notley for... everyone should know that
5787 2018-11-29 15:31:46 lol someone tweeted a picture of pancakes the other day saying that’s not syrup that’s motor oil. I was confused until now 
5788 2018-11-29 15:31:45 I thought that we got 4 times more oil from Canada anyway, and at better prices. America has no reason to be in business with Saudi. Only drumpf and Kushner do personally. Drumpf is selling weapons that Saudi is using in Yemen just so her can have personal business with them.

5790 2018-11-29 15:31:42 Plastic prices have gone up a lot since 2011, even as crude oil has tanked, and the parts count on this figure is likely wildly above MP-10.

But like I said, I think the price is at least partially intentional on Takara's part.  Smaller market but a higher profit per fig.
5791 2018-11-29 15:31:30 We need to expand out refineries.  I haven’t heard any talk regarding that.  But yes No Foreign Oil please!

5816 2018-11-29 15:29:45 How so? Nonsense? Because supply costs don't apply to oil?
5817 2018-11-29 15:29:29 And you’ve never been close to Fact or reason . We subsidise the Uk not the other way round , wm steals and spends while Scotland earns and gets held back . £160 million from the Eu for Scottish farmers given to English farmers £360 billion in oil taxation squandered .
5818 2018-11-29 15:29:23 I'm rounding "middle." Some studies show 4 to 5 or 6 (particularly with ethanol now often present)!

5846 2018-11-29 15:27:24 My grandmas church friends are saying that essential oils are against believing in god cx because you’re using the oil in your own vain to help your senses feel better....?!!?? What.
5847 2018-11-29 15:27:23 yep, those virtue signalers. Will it as widespread and enduring a fad as SUVs? Hard to say. But these will never, ever be seen as being the vehicle you want to work on an oil pipeline in -20C, or haul a 21-ft fishing skiff, or taking into northern Quebec to hunt moose, or...
5848 2018-11-29 15:27:21 yep, any oil production that happen was on private land OUTside of Obamas reach, & lets not forget that lil #keystonePipline thing

5864 2018-11-29 15:26:02 Oil is widely available at production cost of 20 USD or bellow and for countries it is profitable to extract it even if they sell it at break even price because in this way they create employment and boosting their economy. Therefore my long term target price for oil is 20-25 USD
5865 2018-11-29 15:25:53 They can sell whatever they want in EUR. That doesn't help when the new oil elephant in the room is eating more of their European cake.

5874 2018-11-29 15:25:29 Have to factor in everything. Most teams know roughly how many miles/laps they can put on an engine, trans, rear end before they have to get torn down and rebuilt.

You should see a professional about it, they'll either give you oil, vaccum or wash it out.
5895 2018-11-29 15:23:44 Na our Fulani girls come worse
5896 2018-11-29 15:23:42 Yes, I know you’re all super pissed about Saudi Arabia and MBS getting away with the murder of an American journalist. 

But you’re still driving, which means you’re still using oil, which means you are showing how pissed you are by giving your money to the Saudi government.
5897 2018-11-29 15:23:41 Dramatic increase in oil production had nothing to do with Obama. It was all about new technologies developed for horizontal drilling and completion strategies in emerging unconventional shale plays. Period.
5898 2018-11-29 15:23:40 I joke a lot about it but I just want it known that anytime I talk about getting into weather analytics / forecasting for oil / natural gas trading I'm not joking

5900 2018-11-29 15:23:36 Ridiculous that we still buy their oil. I'd be fine with buying the US more in the interim until we figure our own shit out, if it means cutting off all Saudi ties.

5902 2018-11-29 15:23:35 There is an exception for producers with less than 25,000 BBL/d of production. This limits proration to only the top 13 producers. Also note that most smaller and independent energy producers are gas focused and not oil focused. Gas producers are not affected by the this plan.

5917 2018-11-29 15:22:09 I'd say look for half the oil companies that are around today to be gone tomorrow. Either broke or bought out. Thinning the heard just as they did & are doing in gold.
5918 2018-11-29 15:22:08 Why can't farmers accept risk? In the oil field there are no guarantees

5928 2018-11-29 15:21:42 Kindly stop acting as a stooge for the fossil fuel industry celebrating lower oil prices and get to work on a Green New Deal to switch our country to green solar, wind, and geothermal energy sources.  Your betrayal of America's young people is staggering to deny climate change.
5929 2018-11-29 15:21:40 If you believe he had anything to do with that you a idiot ! Fact is he did everything he could to hurt the oil companies!He wouldn’t pass the pipeline &put more restrictions on the companies ! Production went up cause the fracking that was going on

5943 2018-11-29 15:21:04 The oil boom during his tenure was the saving grace for his administration. It hid the failed economic plan and No, he was not responsible for the boom. It's a global market, the only reason we are now a major player is purely attributed to American oil companies.
5944 2018-11-29 15:20:56 Oil nose diving helps. As much as we produce, we still import.
5945 2018-11-29 15:20:56 Thank you Mr. Obama for helping America become a booming economy and the top oil producer.  Only you could have done this.  If you hadn't left the Oval office, we still would be at the bottom of the oil producing heap.

5948 2018-11-29 15:20:47 The biofuel uses oil  extracted from waste coffee and mixes it with diesel.
5949 2018-11-29 15:20:47 Rick Santorum said the 97% of climate scientists spew out lies about GCC to mke a living. He, on the other hand, earns his living the honest way by taking money from the petroleum industry to counter those lies. Does sucking oil teach more about the climate than studying climate?

5958 2018-11-29 15:20:18 Yes! We have had some success with cbd oil and treats however his level of anxiety requires wicked high doses that quite honestly get pretty costly. Giving these meds a try and if it’s not great, we’ll go back to the cbd :)
5959 2018-11-29 15:20:09 What you are saying makes no sense. The message was about Erdogan family deals with ISIS and oil exchanged for weapons to the terrorists!
5960 2018-11-29 15:20:01 No big mega factory's that produces bacon, eggs, beef dripping, coconut oil, meat, etc. Its mostly independent traders.  So who changes our minds that this stuff is so bad for us? Yes big mega factories that want you eating there highly processed crap. Cereal, Refined oils etc
5961 2018-11-29 15:19:57 @CBCSuhana If there is a surplus of our crude oil, what are we supposed to do about it?  Supply and demand rules the marketplace, not Notley or Trudeau.
5962 2018-11-29 15:19:53 But I thought we have to keep burning fossil fuels and mining coal or the economy will tank! And there's no way those oil riggers and coal miners want a safer job.

5971 2018-11-29 15:19:09 None of that undercuts anything I shared about oil, or that unemployment dropped from almost 10 to under 5 percent, or that the stock market almost tripled under Obama. AndBTW,  $33B in regulation reduction is barely more than one-tenth of one percent of GDP.

5973 2018-11-29 15:19:00 Funny cuz his entire presidency was against fracking, drilling , and oil . I should knw because when he took office it was like a light switch flipped off . That quick , I work in the industry and since Obama has been out there has been no more fear of regulations . Thx trump !
5974 2018-11-29 15:18:59 Thanks to the plunging oil prices. Shows how venerable our economy is to oil prices.

5978 2018-11-29 15:18:53 Also, growth rates were higher before the oil price shocks. The UK was considered to be in relative decline particularly compared to Germany and Japan. Symbolised by fact that unemployment peaks and troughs rose in each cycle.

6030 2018-11-29 15:14:48 Canada is not a significant amount of people. GM, Uber and google are designing services that you buy. The cars will run 24/7. You won’t own a car. You won’t drive a car. This is where we are going. It’s not a debate or an anti oil statement. It’s a fact.
6031 2018-11-29 15:14:47 L okay I will you  joya those are so stinky :(

6033 2018-11-29 15:14:42 UBS strategist just said on CNBC  that they expect oil to trade up to $85 in the next year. I am expecting it to fall to $10 as a global bust hits demand hard. Two very divergent views. Time will tell.

6035 2018-11-29 15:14:34 @BVNP What is the name of the brand of CBD oil do you use? If you said it on the air sorry I missed it.
6036 2018-11-29 15:14:30 I think it’s so funny when girls have a car and they don’t check it once in a while, they don’t check their oil or nothing like giiiiirrrrrl what is you doing?
6037 2018-11-29 15:14:29 So there's this thing called bulletproof coffee...
And I made it today.
Sub coconut oil instead of butter and added a scoop of MCT oil powder as my creamer. Not fond of the taste (no sugar :'c ) but my lips are soft thanks to the coconut oil lol gotta get back on my ketosis ya'll
6038 2018-11-29 15:14:27 I don’t want tooooo  but one day I might try the non thc oil
6039 2018-11-29 15:14:26 I had it set to 2, below that is simmer. Found out I was lacking common sense because I was basically frying my pancakes when I greased the pan with olive oil 
6040 2018-11-29 15:14:24 Here's the thing probably 80% of the people who lost their jobs didn't even live in Alberta,  people from all over Canada worked in those oil fields and got let go .
6041 2018-11-29 15:14:24 Why would I wait until the day I’m leaving to do laundry!? I’m so damn sleepy & still have to go get an oil change then to my eye appointment . Oh & pack 
6042 2018-11-29 15:14:24 Just bought myself an oil change as an early Xmas gift
6043 2018-11-29 15:14:20 へーこんなんあるんですか、気をつけます。
6044 2018-11-29 15:14:19 Hmmm interesting. I recall Obama’s daughter leaving their posh vacation in the Caribbean to go protest the gas pipeline. How does she feel now knowing her daddy is taking credit for MORE fossil fuel OIL production? The BS that comes out of that man’s mouth is amazing.
6045 2018-11-29 15:14:18 To be clear, she did say she wants oil to come second to grain. Still, your point that Ottawa should never have let it come to this, is very true.
6046 2018-11-29 15:14:04 Bhai jan ogra ko bolo mhrbani kry oil sasta ho rha hai aur ogra mhnga kr rhi hai khuda ko mano
6047 2018-11-29 15:13:59 Except the town residents who will see their towns blow up caused by oil cars derailments. Lac-Mégantic "je me souviens".
6048 2018-11-29 15:13:44 Lol it was great while it lasted...
6049 2018-11-29 15:13:39 Good morning Maya. The actual act of changing the oil is fairly quick but times can be impacted by how busy your Honda dealer is. For an estimated time of repair, we recommend speaking with your Service Advisor. They should be able to tell you more. ^WD
6050 2018-11-29 15:13:39 There is a good reason for the phrase "oil is a curse". Other than Arab countries who have for the most part used their oil wealth for the wellbeing of their citizens, many countries, especially in Africa haven't. E.g. Nigeria, Angola, S. Sudan. Uganda may not b any different.
6051 2018-11-29 15:13:24 When oil turns this is going to really re-rate. Catalysts still exist before year end #TXP
6052 2018-11-29 15:13:20 But isn't oil bad? You can't demonize an industry for 10 years and then take credit when it does well despite your policies.
6053 2018-11-29 15:13:20 Obama did not approve ONE new oil drilling permit his entire tenure! He lies so bad it's unbelievable. I guess he knows his supporters will never actually look at the facts and just believe whatever comes out of his lying mouth.
6054 2018-11-29 15:13:13 Who the real villain the one crack dealing or oil drilling?  You in my mother land and you killing all her children
6055 2018-11-29 15:13:12 それでのんもたんの疲れを癒せるのならっ！！！
6056 2018-11-29 15:13:09 If I was loosing money on every barrel of oil I sold, I would just quit doing it!
6057 2018-11-29 15:13:05 It's the selfie king he hates Alberta oil.
6058 2018-11-29 15:12:56 Lol. Alright. Please explain how the liberals caused the current disproportionate value of our oil. This probably will take a good 10 tweets to explain the connection so I will give you all the time you need. 

Ps. If you reply w insult. I win
6059 2018-11-29 15:12:55 So 36,000 GM workers will lose their jobs, but you didn't hear a peep from Trudeau about the 250 000 oil/energy workers that got laid off! That doesn't even take into account the secondary businesses that would've been affected due pipeline cancellations.
6060 2018-11-29 15:12:52 Stop putting vile palm oil in your confectionery
6061 2018-11-29 15:12:46 and now Pkk is killing the opposition leaders of Kurds, forcing the people to leave or obey, forcing their children to join them, controlling 1/3 of Syria, %70 of oil, water and natural gas pretending they are fighting with isis, and isis is gladly giving them the land +
6062 2018-11-29 15:12:29 วันนี้อุตส่าห์ใส่ oil ผมหอมๆ พอกลับมาบ้าน ผมเหม็นกลิ่นชานมไข่มุกเฉย

6065 2018-11-29 15:12:17 no. comade drumpft is sub-par he gets played every time he tries to engage others...they write a "love" letter to him...he melts and expresses his love for them & his proclamations of success are the snake oil he sells to the cult
6066 2018-11-29 15:12:14 try teatree oil with water 
6067 2018-11-29 15:12:13 Try cbd oil...it has helped my pain ..have a blessed day

6069 2018-11-29 15:12:11 FY 2008 (Bush's last full year) - # of federal gas/oil leases issued: 2416

FY2016 (Obama's last year) - # of leases issued:  520

8 years of blaming Bush for every bad thing that happened, and the rest of his life claiming credit for every good thing that will happen.

"Thank you Mr. Obama for helping America become a booming economy & top oil producer.  Only you could have done this.  If you hadn't left the Oval office, we'd still be at the bottom of the oil producing heap."
6072 2018-11-29 15:11:58 Agreed. I really wish Brian Jean would have won the leadership race. They would have had my vote with him there. I do get my paychecks from the oil and gas sector but will have a hard time being a part of electing this wingnut.
6073 2018-11-29 15:11:56 There are many women who appreciate good foot massage from polite subs at @ClubPedestal. My advice to the subs who want to offer it - bring wet tissues and foot cream/oil which smells nice, then you can be very popular! ;-D
6074 2018-11-29 15:11:55 Wtf is palm oil
6075 2018-11-29 15:11:45 Unreliable, volotile, and on it way to instinction. A known fact. Vehicles however will ALWAYS be with us, electric or any other kind of propulsion system. Oil is a steping stone.
6076 2018-11-29 15:11:24 QR 77 today at 10 AM instead on the oil mesh.
6077 2018-11-29 15:11:17 This weekend you’d probably want to talk about oil.. #Spursy flashbacks at the Emirates...
6078 2018-11-29 15:11:15 Buy and sell pages here in Belgium are now inundated with offers of olive oil (and other random Italian agri-products) from random posters from southern Italy and Sicily. Makes you wonder what is behind them, and what kind of rackets respondents get locked into.
6079 2018-11-29 15:11:13 Nice motor oil you got there
6080 2018-11-29 15:11:05 @DividendMaster Some of the CNBC commentary is on the mystery of midstream share performance vs. oil price history.
6081 2018-11-29 15:11:02 let’s see how much money the people changing my oil can get out of me before i start crying and get a free one
6082 2018-11-29 15:11:01 Rand you are wrong on this one. Do you want 150 dollar a barrel oil??
6083 2018-11-29 15:10:59 I had a bad bout in my 20s. It was life changing in that I now avoid all alcohol (acts as a depressive on nervous system). Avoid pain meds, eat ultra healthy, take cod liver oil, eat sugars very rarely, exercise, sleep. This works4me. I stay vigilant-hugs
6084 2018-11-29 15:10:57 One assumes you prepared the tomato sauce properly, hence olive oil already included (and no garlic…)
6085 2018-11-29 15:10:54 So than around harvest season will it be grain or oil those trains haul.
6086 2018-11-29 15:10:49 He had nothing to do with the economy or the oil. He needs to endure the same fate as Hoffa's and just disappear.
6087 2018-11-29 15:10:40 Wrapping up a great week of meetings in Texas: Full house at the Petroleum Club of Houston for the Texas Spain Oil and Gas Forum and excellent visits to the LNG US giants on the Gulf Coast.
6088 2018-11-29 15:10:37 The double-pronged attack of falling oil revenue and rising value of our dollar denominated debts.Not good at all. Not good.
6089 2018-11-29 15:10:36 Why are people still tweeting about $AMRN? Just a few crazy, long, sad, and pathetic shareholders. No one cares about your fish oil anymore. News flow is done. Enjoy the bleed.
6090 2018-11-29 15:10:33 He's so full of it. His greatest Ally is the short memory of many Americans. I don't suffer that. Bush encouraged exploration and technology of tight oil. Tax breaks. Obama fought it for 8 years, closing the gulf, fighting pipelines, closing Federal lands.
6091 2018-11-29 15:10:31 娘ぇ、自分の毛布を敷いて寝るのはいいが、かーちゃんの毛布まで敷くなよぅ。なんで二枚敷く必要があんだよぅ。返してよぅー(*T^T)
6092 2018-11-29 15:10:26 I missed the opportunity to ask this woman what people do with crude oil locally and it's gonna hunt me for a long while.

6095 2018-11-29 15:10:17 To top it off, the US does NOT get the bulk of its imported oil from the Saudis anyway. 40% comes from that country to our north. AND prices at the pump are still higher than they were when t-rump moved into the Oval Office. So even this *argument* of t-rump's falls flat.
6096 2018-11-29 15:10:10 I would add a bit of olive oil, then.
6097 2018-11-29 15:10:07 Ago give u some leader oil
6098 2018-11-29 15:10:04 バターとかマーガリンとか知らないけど多分吸ったぜ。
6099 2018-11-29 15:10:01 The truck that was stopped was bringing help to Bayırbucak Turkmens which are Turks. So selling weapons for oil was so unsupported that later Usa apologized from Turkey for their fake claims. Anyway the plan worked and Turkey image was destroyed. +
6100 2018-11-29 15:09:58 Florida is lit like a Christmas tree 
6101 2018-11-29 15:09:56 Because he's a moron. Many lost their jobs in the oil industry because of this dirt bag.
6102 2018-11-29 15:09:48 Yes I suppose stalling the pipeline for 8 years. Helped Us with our oil production. You are the biggest phony on the face of the Earth. You're out there trying take credit for everything good while you blamed Bush for everything bad

I got this idea from a dream I had
6105 2018-11-29 15:09:45 The SK gov. releases the mid-year numbers, deficit lower than forecast at $348.3m. Revenue slightly up but expenses are too. Oil prices remain the challenge. #skpoli
6106 2018-11-29 15:09:42 “Best tip I ever got was to put my roller bottle of cranberry seed oil in the fridge. OMG it feels so good under my eyes in the morning.” Words from a happy and less tired looking customer.
6107 2018-11-29 15:09:40 I use olive oil on everything because I cook a lot of meat for lunch & dinner. Makes sense why my cookies are always burnt too when I oiled the pan lol! I apparently lack common sense. Glad for friends like you online, my common sense fairies 
6108 2018-11-29 15:09:38 You want to hear another Story. Just watch the extremely rise of the gasoline and heating oil prices in the German market and  compare this with the price current price for oil on the world market.

6110 2018-11-29 15:09:34 Obama is so full of shit. He blocked so much oil production, that we still had massive imports. Blocked pipelines being built, etc. It was those crazy Texans that figured out how to safely frack a formation.
6111 2018-11-29 15:09:29 I've been working on getting a few certs so I can work on construction / mining / oil & gas sites.
6112 2018-11-29 15:09:29 Shameful. The play-acting and spoiled brattiness are an embarrassment to the sport. Add in the oil money and the prognosis looks even worse.
6113 2018-11-29 15:09:26 This is the snake oil salesman answering a question about what’s in his bottle of snake oil.

6121 2018-11-29 15:08:51 Peter Lougheed bought rail cars to move grain. Notley proposes more rail cars for oil. Even with improvements to rail & rail car safety since Lac Mégantic, Notley's idea isn't without risk. She should opt for Lougheed's other idea: an oil production cut.

6126 2018-11-29 15:08:32 Stated security threat is due to fear of oil supply. Not valid. We don’t need Saudi oil for our security. US production now sufficient

And hope u know about oil sector and agriculture.. in relation to the upstream and downstream sector of the topological frame work of d economic ecosystem. i.e to say government regulations and policies toppled with insecurity
6129 2018-11-29 15:08:13 Not to mention variations in the price of oil and the ensuing financial crash.
6130 2018-11-29 15:08:13 my hair is so greasy you could suck the oil and get a five course meal out of it
6131 2018-11-29 15:07:55 I have also read the federal Liberals are planning to take the old single wall tank cars out of circulation at a rate Alberta won’t be able to replace with the safer new double wall cars. If only there was some sort of round long steel cylinder oil could be moved in safely.

6133 2018-11-29 15:07:52 There was a near riot at Kanon Oil Msasa when they started selling diesel. The owner managed to get from 5 policedetails to assist but to no avail. So, they closed and have requested riot police supports before they can open. What sort of adults are we?
6134 2018-11-29 15:07:49 Obama might the most delusional, narcissistic man alive. Trying to take credit for Trump’s accomplishments, including the oil boom? 
6135 2018-11-29 15:07:48 Mostly agree but till we renovate our energy sector (which should be our primary focus) the carbon is coming out. And till someone can figure out nuclear/solar tanks, jets and missiles, having an oil production infrastructure that can be ramped up will be a key strategic interest
6136 2018-11-29 15:07:47 Former President Barack Obama said he was “extraordinarily proud of the Paris accords” before, rather ironically, taking credit for booming U.S. oil and gas production. Idiota!

6144 2018-11-29 15:07:22 Lol all mayo is oil tho
6145 2018-11-29 15:07:21 But we will still take your oil at full price while our own oil industry goes bankrupt.

6151 2018-11-29 15:07:02 Spending 4.5 B on a pipeline to bring oil to tidewater? You cast a lot of blame when the Harper and the PCs had years to address the issue.
6152 2018-11-29 15:06:52 Gotta use that crude oil for something!
6153 2018-11-29 15:06:49 Thank you Mr. Obama for helping America become a booming economy and the top oil producer.  Only you could have done this.  If you hadn't left the Oval office, we still would be at the bottom of the oil producing heap.
6154 2018-11-29 15:06:45 Fuck oil
6155 2018-11-29 15:06:36 Maybe because the Sauds are worth 1.4 trillion dollars? Plus the kid controls humongous oil reserves? Maybe because the US is the only country with true leverage in the situation?

6157 2018-11-29 15:06:32 Oil production did expand...on private land where he couldn’t stop it. That was inspite of his efforts to destroy oil production not because of him. He’s such a liar!
6158 2018-11-29 15:06:25 The problem we have is.... the people who can really change this world. Have only there own common interests at heart. Another energy supply would make their precious oil worthless. This is the bottom line. They have to much to lose
6159 2018-11-29 15:06:25 Thank you Mr. Obama for helping America become a booming economy and the top oil producer.  Only you could have done this.  If you hadn't left the Oval office, we still would be at the bottom of the oil producing heap.
6160 2018-11-29 15:06:22 I’ll give you a hint Brian, for the last 40 years he’s been a huge businessman with dealings all over the world. Can’t hold those dealings after an election. Let’s look at the Rep/Dems who have taken$ from China/Russia/Oil lobbyists. There’s a story!

6162 2018-11-29 15:06:17 ugh that’s horrible. I had to take out mine & stop taking those gummies bc it was so bad. :/ I started doing a lot of coconut oil masks on my hair though & it helped with growth so much!!
6163 2018-11-29 15:06:15 a) They're not on TV anymore. And b) I would disagree with the first sentence (but that's probably a subjective thing in any case).
6164 2018-11-29 15:06:08 When I get messages from my customers telling me they have been able to stop pharm meds and are pain free, it makes my heart happy <3 CBD oil for the win!

6165 2018-11-29 15:06:05 @CRTV Remember, Obama blocked the oil pipeline, tied up oilshale permits for years, and almost eliminated coal and steel production while authorizing aluminum ore to China, uranium ore to Russia, and taxpayer dollars to Solyndra when going bankrupt for panels .  Business Genius ?
6166 2018-11-29 15:06:05 Did you try cbd oil? I’ve heard a lot of people have success trying that for their dogs.
6167 2018-11-29 15:06:02 I had tried pain meds,cutting out certain foods,exercise, chiropractic treatments, therapy, ignoring..yeah right..CBD oil helps the best so far.
6168 2018-11-29 15:05:55 We did with Saudi Arabia I believe. And Desert Shield was originally a mission to prevent Iraqi moves into the Saudi oil fields. Also, I think you can make a case that there were national interests at stake there that are not in play here.
6169 2018-11-29 15:05:54 Imagine knowing the Iraq war was literally over oil and brought nothing but destruction to millions of brown ppl in poorer countries funded by taxpayer money and still signing up just to have a couple thousand dollars more in your bank account lmao
6170 2018-11-29 15:05:50 despite the traffic jams induced by such a cheap oil price....
6171 2018-11-29 15:05:47 Oil has had ups and downs for decades. It is a unreliable source of income for Country and workers alike in the long run. GM is a steady employer providing good wages and benefits. 

The end of GM in Cnda to open in Mexico is a direct result of free trade! 

IMO apples+oranges
6172 2018-11-29 15:05:44 technically we did become the oil and gas leader during his time as president so if your problem is his narcissism you must really hate trump
6173 2018-11-29 15:05:43 Oil prices dropping by 2/3rds impacted oil production. Government doesn't control the price of oil.
6174 2018-11-29 15:05:36 Exactly or Sometimes I also drink palm oil

6188 2018-11-29 15:04:51 President Trump doesn't care about the origin of the oil as long as the numbers work in the favor of the American people.  How do we know that the Saudis have not made a deal we can not live without ....

6207 2018-11-29 15:03:38 Funny. Know what would cut emissions? A pipeline. Fewer trucks driving west, fewer trains. Also, getting Nat Gas and oil to markets like China that burn coal for energy, allowing them to use cleaner energy. Its GLOBAL warming not Canada warming.

6211 2018-11-29 15:03:27 Dear one.. have you tried cbd oil? I am getting good results.  I can move better and the pain has eased . I did take opioids but the regulations changed that . Cbd helps better .
6212 2018-11-29 15:03:23 The peace & calm essential oil she has kind of smells like urine so idk why you let her put that on you
6213 2018-11-29 15:03:17 i honestly hate getting my oil changed. i swear it takes hours every time
6214 2018-11-29 15:03:10 Getting my oil changed. They had a deal for an oil change with a tire rotation, and then there’s a recall for the brake fluid. So I’m staying here for a few hours
6215 2018-11-29 15:03:10 Those oil rail cars will be perfect to get oil to the East coast. Also West coast till the pipeline is done. Lastly South where we make the least return. Just thinking

6221 2018-11-29 15:02:29 And crummy train safety regs, aging tanker cars, means that we have even larger safety risks shipping oil throughout the country. We'll have more explosions, more disasters. Spills. Sigh
6222 2018-11-29 15:02:26 Government is accountable for mismanagement of resource funds when oil prices were at their peak (under the PCs).  Our revenue from Heritage Fund was squandered; no major infrastructure to show for it.  PCs did nothing to rebuild the highway of death to Fort Mac!!! at the time.

6231 2018-11-29 15:01:31 $wti #oil supply supported recent decline but it’s overdone given shale’s marginal cost. when momentum turns we will see a big squeeze. I wouldn’t be surprised to see wti above $55 next week, maybe $58. Trump can’t recant Saudi assassination comments so Saudis free to pump less.

6236 2018-11-29 15:01:10 Don't be an ass. Unlike the fear of societal collapse if rich oil merchants can't rape the Earth and bilk another billion out of poor people trying to keep their heads above water, or if immigrants or robots or AIs 'steal our jerbs', Climate change is real and fucking scary.

Carbonated beverages should not be used in excess in view of harmful effects on the health adding that fried items such as samosas, pakoras and chips should also be avoided as oil used for frying is mostly sold at cheap rates,
6251 2018-11-29 15:00:13 lefties attacking Beto for being too centrist (not fully embracing Medicare4 all or waffling and oil$$ donors) centrist attacking Beto for too leftist (no pac money, friendly to immigrants).  Both attacking him with  'he lost'.  Neither taking note that he had 55k at a rally.
6252 2018-11-29 15:00:08 I had 15 years of that working on cap markets / geopolitics / natural resources in the former soviet union. My god it could be fun. Eating salt fish and drinking beer with the Board of the Kazakh state oil company at their hunting retreat.

6259 2018-11-29 14:59:50 it's called crony capitalism and government interference via regulation/policy. Oil and autos all over the world are NOT CAPITALISM. They are instruments of government policy. Not at all sure why I am so stupid to invest in these industries knowing that.
6260 2018-11-29 14:59:50 Kind of torn on canola. Weak prices suggest a bigger crop but 2018 was a hot summer and could have reduced yield. Oil content is down considerably too, which could account for lower prices.

6267 2018-11-29 14:59:21 @1053rnb Listening about olive oil on black hair.  Olive oil is one of the best oil you can apply to black hair and skin.  Best to wash and braid black children hair.  People shouldn't use perms. Too many chemicals.
6268 2018-11-29 14:59:10 That is definitely an asphalt overlay.  Flying embers did not ignite that asphalt but the 'tack oil' or 'AC' component of hot mix asphalt will definitely burn, leaving behind rocks, sand and a black ash remnant of the tack oil.  So I wouldn't try to stand on this for DEW proof.

6274 2018-11-29 14:58:42 Really.  BHO is claiming credit for the US increase in oil production when he shut down all production in the gulf.  I'm not focused on what he says.  I'm looking at what he does.
6275 2018-11-29 14:58:40 Respectfully, I don't believe that this specific effort of Alberta will have a significant affect on global oil prices, and I don't see that their efforts in general are cause for an ethical dilemma.  Further, when did ethics start playing a role in world commodity prices?
6276 2018-11-29 14:58:26 And Obama’s out running his mouth that he created it.  He claims credit for oil exploration gains-he’s smokin dope again...

6278 2018-11-29 14:58:06 You cost U.S. oil producers an export market to China. Where did it go? To Iran, of all places, when you granted waivers on sanctions.

6296 2018-11-29 14:56:54 Yes, pretty rough. Last time we sat a drop like this, SLB didn’t go below $61 or so, and that was when oil was around $40
6297 2018-11-29 14:56:54 I think that leaves out the influence of GOP's largest donors, whose money is in oil and gas chess game in the region. That's purposefully kept out of the public eye by donors...repackaged as nat'l security, protecting women and children.

6300 2018-11-29 14:56:34 I would've liked to see a leg toward 45 before the December OPEC meet but I like that 58-60 range for sure.
Putin says he likes oil at 60 a couple hours after seen chatting the saudis up. Supply reduction December 6th.
6301 2018-11-29 14:56:32 Me and the midnight oil are old pals. CWC: 44,316
6302 2018-11-29 14:56:30 Don’t you mean Donald Trump’s the one bragging about being world’s biggest oil and gas producer? Obama frequently spoke out against dependency on fossil fuels...
6303 2018-11-29 14:56:26 Let them motherly bring the folk work oil of the control as the founding Hungnam!
6304 2018-11-29 14:56:20 You’re an idiot. The current economic policies are going to have crippling effects in the future. China, one of the largest importers of US goods has already cut out soybeans, oil, seafood, etc. by solidifying other sources. Just wait for that ripple effect. Fool.
6305 2018-11-29 14:56:19 Can’t blame Notley for world oil prices.  Even you should know that!
6306 2018-11-29 14:56:13 I had one in New England where I burned oil for heat. If you have no fuel burning appliances there is no way to make CO.
6307 2018-11-29 14:56:12 Do you take any??  I have osteoarthritis so I take cod liver oil as I don’t eat much fish. Sunshine pills (vit d)  and now Boots Osteocare. Is it all a waste of time?
6308 2018-11-29 14:56:01 Honestly, I wouldn't mind a motor oil in my pancakes SKSKSKSK
6309 2018-11-29 14:55:57 Obama is a snake oil salesman. His fraudulent comments saying he supported fossil fuels prove it.

6318 2018-11-29 14:55:01 We’d be in the EU. Our trading routes are what the EU tell us. If there’s no deal between U.K. and EU then that applies to us. We’d need to pay billions back to oil companies for their decades of investment. Personally we should leave the stuff in the ground.

6323 2018-11-29 14:54:22 I refer you to the comments of @barackobama at @riceuniversity who yesterday attempted to convince the audience gathered there that he was responsible for the new American Oil Boom, and that @realDonaldTrump was simply riding his coattails like he was on the rest of the economy.
6324 2018-11-29 14:54:19 Hey @Varneyco , your glee over falling gasoline prices doesn’t play well in Metro Houston, and other Oil and Gas communities. There is a balance you should strive for.

6333 2018-11-29 14:53:43 That’s not what the Syrians and the rest of the world say about Erdogan’s  invasion and bombing of civilians. Erdogan supported ISIS terrorists. He was selling them weapons in exchange for oil. Turkish reporters uncovered him and videotaped the trucks. What a short memory!

6348 2018-11-29 14:52:18 A plane of this size would’ve required an immense amount of resources in just making it. Metals and minerals mined from the earth by slave labour where forests once stood.

6354 2018-11-29 14:51:45 There is bigger things at play... look at the each country's agenda, who they are forming unwritten alliances, and what they have to gain. Oil really is a secondary issue. What is the real issue... maybe power... Is this also a religious war...

6372 2018-11-29 14:50:00 It's tax. You, a republican, just taxed the American people, and somehow your base doesn't see it. You are a snake oil salesman that your "tonic" is going to eventually catch up to you.
6373 2018-11-29 14:49:55 I support the people, I don’t support the industry. Highly trained workers can find other good jobs that don’t destroy the planet. If there were a bigger investment in clean energy sector, many oil + gas workers would be highly sought after
6374 2018-11-29 14:49:49 Let’s not forget; the only reason why Gas and Oil productivity increased during the “Green” Obama years is because all that exploration and production was done on PRIVATE LANDS! As much as it pissed of the Obama admin (they tried to obstruct it) there was nothing they could do!

6378 2018-11-29 14:49:40 This doesn't remove the nits, though, so buy a lice comb and go through his/her hair thoroughly to remove them.  Then put lavender essential oil on your hair brushes on a weekly basis.  It will help to prevent them from getting lice.
6379 2018-11-29 14:49:27 Niger Republic becomes an oil producing nation.

But some funny elements here said oil cannot be found in the North.

What if the oil under the ground in north is more than that in the entire south? Thinking of the deserts and dry lands of Arabia, Iran. Iraq, etc

6381 2018-11-29 14:49:18 I get oil changes every 3000 miles. My last air filter was replaced in Oct, maybe Sept?, and today they were saying I need another one. I think they’re just trying to take advantage of me! 
6382 2018-11-29 14:49:15 @BarackObama trying to take credit for the oil boom makes as much sense as @algore saying he created the internet

6422 2018-11-29 14:46:32 An astonishing turn-around in fortunes, almost entirely due to the pursuit of shale oil & gas fracking, which his liberal/left-leaning supporters object so voraciously to.

6424 2018-11-29 14:46:22 WTF, they think they can buy cars, build new loading sidings, and start moving oil right away. Why didn’t they do this during the backlog of grain?? They want the carbon tax $ from the locomotives. This is just a pipe dream!!
6425 2018-11-29 14:46:19 An amoral corrupt billionaire real-estate developer with a vested interest in coal and oil lashes back against the entire scientific community to say the planet is just fine.  If we are debating this... it might be that humanity is just too stupid to survive?
6426 2018-11-29 14:46:07 They've been seduced by a snake oil salesman. There is no interest in empiricism, only what 'feels right'; such a great man can't be wrong, after all... Confirmation bias, and a whole host of other biases and fallacies run riot.

6432 2018-11-29 14:45:43 Yes climate change is such an issue Obama took credit for the oil boom in the US while touting his climate change agenda. This is a political talking point and you are all full of crap, only fools believe you just ask Obama he told you fools yesterday..
6433 2018-11-29 14:45:42 I cornered you there buts that's fine, you got no fatcs to refute my premises. The big O was big into Oil .

6435 2018-11-29 14:45:18 he was instrumental in blocking oil expansion, wouldn't approve the pipeline....but "Oh yeah, blocking oil production in America was the root cause for becoming the biggest oil producer"...I think Mr. Obama is back to the ganga...
6436 2018-11-29 14:45:18 Man, I take to that game like oil to water.  If it is the superior culture, I will hang back here eating mud.

6439 2018-11-29 14:45:00 My dear Max, government funding, which pays most of these scientists, comes with HUGE strings.  Produce the right results or lose funding.  Amazing how if a scientist is funded by say the Oil industry, scientist is shamed as biased yet that standard doesn't apply to govt paid.
6440 2018-11-29 14:44:57 2 - And let's get something clear, if American's can't buy cars built by  AN AMERICAN AUTOMOTIVE COMPANY - what the hell makes you think that  they can afford to buy cars that are MORE EXPENSIVE?  
YOUR SPIN DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE!!  PEOPLE KNOW WHAT A SNAKE OIL SALESMAN YOU ARE!
6441 2018-11-29 14:44:54 English taxpayers ? Any currency we want , personally I’d favour a new Scottish currency . How will you service your £2 trillion of debt without Scottish oil as a guarantee ? Will you refuse to trade with iscotland  ?

6451 2018-11-29 14:43:47 The craziest thing happened to me yesterday. I commented on Twitter that heavy sanctions should be placed on Russia, oil, freeze banking accounts, food, etc. I said the Russian people would eventually get rid of the thug, Putin. I get a phone call from Russia!!! No message left!

6454 2018-11-29 14:43:35 Got up early and got my oil changed all by myself ... Daughter of the year 
6455 2018-11-29 14:43:34 First of all, YOU DA BOMB! I don’t believe that it’s six month intervals between my oil changes, MAYBE three? That’s why I am confused. Am I driving in areas of higher pollution, are the breath of my passengers too hot, what is going on?! LOl.
6456 2018-11-29 14:43:34 Ewwww, Kingy. Y’all better not be using Vick’s as oil lmao

6461 2018-11-29 14:43:14 Dr sb Geo usually give fake news ,butt if it's so then very bad really disturbing when oil is touching lowest it should be reduced to 90
6462 2018-11-29 14:43:12 slight nuance here - both oil price (mostly) and carbon tax drove prices up, but protests were triggered by two repeated FR gov decision tax raises on gasoline & diesel. people know what is due to gov decision and what isn't.
6463 2018-11-29 14:43:12 peut être pas, mais le transport c'est quand même 27% de l'empreinte carbone d'un français et c'est le levier sur lequel des optimisations sont les plus faciles à faire. Du vélo, la fin des voitures trop lourdes et hop, quelques % économisés quasi sans efforts.
6464 2018-11-29 14:43:10 2/2 I don’t work in O&G but the economy is all intertwined. 7600 jobs lost per month, 2.5 GM plants, It’s scary! If AB oil was Bombardier this would’ve been solved. AB O&G is of National interest - it needs to get to the market that demands it at market price.
6465 2018-11-29 14:43:02 Seeing gas prices rise again over $1 - $1.039 at some stations.

Yet oil prices are falling. 

*sigh*
6466 2018-11-29 14:42:58 This is a big sign that Sarah is not very educated about Ukraine's involvement in the 2016 election and that her FOX appearances are not about bringing truth to light, but rather covering the war crimes of Obama, McCain & the will of Russian Oil Oligarchs 
6467 2018-11-29 14:42:55 That makes a lot of sense but don't you think the "oil issue" is in there too?
6468 2018-11-29 14:42:54 No oil in Ukraine so no need to help them, if Russia or Iran or China attack Saudi Arabia all westerners will use their nukes to protect Saudis...
6469 2018-11-29 14:42:53 Absolutely not.
Oil companies can do bcoz they all follow almost same pricing.
If they r also not United n say 1company give oil in 30rs less then there also same thing will occur.
Similarly, if all farmers r united and decide to sell on fix price then they will hv same benefits.

6480 2018-11-29 14:42:15 Heating oil prices slightly higher this morning at 9:27 AM EST. 184.62 +0.78  +0.42%. The price is still set for its biggest one-month fall in November since the depths of the financial crisis in 2008, having lost more than 22 percent so far.
6481 2018-11-29 14:42:14 Easy... Money.. lots of money. Our government is corrupt. Big oil and Corps pay millions to buy Congress and Senate. Shit country, shit leaders, and lawyers cheating everyone! Welcome to the one of the shittier, unfree countries... The USA!
6482 2018-11-29 14:42:13 “to those who mourn in Zion—to give them a beautiful headdress instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, the garment of praise instead of a faint spirit; that they may be called oaks of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he may be glorified.” Isa 61:3
6483 2018-11-29 14:42:05 They’d make far more working for oil companies. How much will oil executives lose when we switch to renewables?
6484 2018-11-29 14:42:02 These Folks Really Just Tried To Charge Me $70 For An Oil Change 
6485 2018-11-29 14:41:59 With today’s fall in the #oil_price from $70 to below $50 a barrel, oil dependent economies will bleed really bad, but question is; how bad? Well, that basically depends on the degree of a country’s dependence on oil revenue. @Rep_South_Sudan in deep shit. #Diversify the economy!
6486 2018-11-29 14:41:58 you fucking with the motor oil and cardboard huh?

6490 2018-11-29 14:41:33 Look here, is not everybody in Saudi Arabia have oil well in them backyard yu know! Poor people down there too! In the most prosperous of times and places, a segment of the people are ahurting still too! We should keep the cheapest meal more affordable.
6491 2018-11-29 14:41:30 I learned from the master.  Bob Ross.  I should use youtube more.  I remember now watching some great art videos on there.  I need to buy more supplies.  I bought a starter set and ran out of red.  That kinda of curtailed my oil painting.  Your kind words have inspired me. Thanks
6492 2018-11-29 14:41:29 Let me get this right:

Alberta is losing 80 milliom $$ a day because they can't get their oil out to market efficiently, & JT calls a meeting of the premiers to discuss the fact that "French" is not getting enough attention.  Jesusphuck...
6493 2018-11-29 14:41:13 Oil and gas has and had nothing to do with Obama. And he had no leadership on anything
6494 2018-11-29 14:41:08 @ABDanielleSmith Immediately impose an import tax on all of the 750,000  barrels per day oil imported into eastern Canada and use that revenue to  subsidize the price differential on the western Canadian select price. This would get things moving.
6495 2018-11-29 14:41:07 I was working in Williston and Obumbo fought the oil industry every inch of the way. The offshore drilling moratorium and Iran deal pretty much stopped all oil field activity and put tens of thousands of Americans out of work. #THANKSFORNOTHING.

6499 2018-11-29 14:40:41 @realDonaldTrump 's USA, the biggest threat to world peace, doesn't care for human rights. They only care for their interests first, their friends next and never for human rights. They only want oil, gold, diamonds, control...... not human rights
6500 2018-11-29 14:40:41 yesterday we were at this shop & i asked for basically the same things my pals were getting only with no meat, the woman was like we use the same utensils & oil & i was like that’s okay & she goes “you’re not vegetarian then u just don’t like meat?” & i was like hmm
6501 2018-11-29 14:40:38 This definitely is not reflected in home heating oil pump prices etc.... why so??
6502 2018-11-29 14:40:36 The month's Green Champions Bulletin features palm oil, plastic, #WorldVeganMonth and #SHCAwards18. @NottsHealthcare staff sign up to read
6503 2018-11-29 14:40:32 Van.. Thanks for including the report. BC of past behaviors, world inv. levels, etc. I believe a positive message will be sent at G 20 and a cut will be agreed at the Dec meeting. I believe the temp. Relief on sanctions will put upwd pressure when they expire. Oil up from here
6504 2018-11-29 14:40:31 The way I see Trump's actions is,
"Hey, we know what you did. Give us cheap oil or we will punish you."
I actually like Trump,
But I would compare this kind of deal making, that has been going on for decades, as political extortion.
6505 2018-11-29 14:40:29 mas gusto ko cooking oil
6506 2018-11-29 14:40:18 Whether it has done anything for Ghanaians or not is a topic for another discussion. The issue right now is that they came from behind and passed Uganda in the quest to get their oil into the market.

6510 2018-11-29 14:40:00 .@michellemungall @GeorgeHeyman Don’t let industry off the hook by implementing weak methane regulations for oil and gas. Inspections based on looking and smelling for an odourless invisible gas just don’t cut it #bcpoli
6511 2018-11-29 14:39:58 Self-evident misogyny! Look at the kind of companies that sponsor F1. Banks. Oil. Betting. Energy drink & alcoholic spirits. IT & other tech. Heavy engineering. Tyres & dampers. Men's fashion (Hugo Boss) & watches. The whole system is enormously biased towards men.
6512 2018-11-29 14:39:56 America does produce a lot of oil which is why we don’t need to go overseas for anyone else’s oil or resources & gas prices should be even lower then they are now... we should be paying more like 75cents a gallon instead of 2, 3, or 4 dollars. #Truth
6513 2018-11-29 14:39:53 #lyingAndy Alberta is the victim of world oil prices and an oil glut + the companies subsidised by CPC gov't now abandoning the wells & leaving a mess for taxpayers - again - to clean up. The other 50% of the fault is on Harper's & Scheer's shoulders. Trudeau wasn't even around.
6514 2018-11-29 14:39:51 That's right. He encouraged fracking which is the real reason oil prices dropped. Coal doesn't help anyone. Costs even more than tar sands to produce and inefficient to use. 17th century technology goes well with Trump's wall .

6518 2018-11-29 14:39:18 @BarackObama Our oil production was no thanks to you. That was US. You don't deserve credit for anything good that happened  over the last ten years. you are still the biggest liar ever born in Kenya.
6519 2018-11-29 14:39:08 Help me explain, Meye suburbuda
6520 2018-11-29 14:39:03 Not really. Reagan's best line was that he wouldn't make his opponents youth and inexperience an issue.  With age comes experience, wisdom and courtesy.  Housing & autos are DIW; oil & many commodities down:  this pause made sense.  The Fed was trying to push as much as it could.
6521 2018-11-29 14:38:59 He caved to Big Oil. Fracking should be banned! Instead, it's everywhere and driving climate change.
6522 2018-11-29 14:38:43 Yea I saw a food scam advert showing how we been deceived with cardboard and engine oil for , and fake 
6523 2018-11-29 14:38:35 Why are our children still dying in Afghanistan? Even the Russians were smart enough to get out after 10 years. All they have is opioids. If it's about 9/11, we were  misdirected - the hijackers were Saudis - oh right they're our investor, oil friends who chop up journalists.
6524 2018-11-29 14:38:28 So u must hv used fake stuffs you mentioned fr it to cost 60k at the end

6531 2018-11-29 14:37:31 @cspanwj  if we sent oil, coal and gas to backward countries the world would be better off, but no, let them burn dung and cardboard keep them under UN thumb! DISGRACEFUL!
6532 2018-11-29 14:37:28 Only the #marijuana strain of the plant. My opinion nothing else. But if I got diagnosed with #cancer I’d drink hash oil. Get some Valium saved up and just saturate my blood with #cannabinoids. First thing I’d do. Heavy doses. Heavy heavy doses. I’ll see if you can OD or not.

6537 2018-11-29 14:36:58 Slowly but surely they’re going up on my online shop.  
I hope to have them all up by the end of the weekend, although that was last week’s goal.  
I’m working on it, I promise!

6544 2018-11-29 14:36:49 Face:

-use an oil based cleanser
-exfoliate at least once a week
-use face masks that are for your skin type
-use a hydrating serum
-use a toner
-use a heavier moisturiser

Top speed of 5K. Runs on coal generated electricity. We are changing to NG by 2030. 

At the same time, oil is being imported into Atlantic Canada by tanker from Venezuela and the Middle East. Change is real but slow.

6561 2018-11-29 14:35:52 Eastern Canada is really starting to piss me off. At what point do they realize that without oil revenues our country is headed for financial ruin. Those arrogant babies need a serious wake up call.

6564 2018-11-29 14:35:43 So how exactly did your facts prove that Obama was not a big Oil president. Fact of the matter is Oil Production dramatically increased under his watch.
6565 2018-11-29 14:35:37 I work at the Oil and Gas and some companies already warned their employees that there will be layoffs coming as early as January. People that quit or got fired will not be replaced and back to skeleton crew again.
6566 2018-11-29 14:35:35 @BarackObama is, once again, outright LYING. He did everything in his power to go electric cars, put billions in to solar plants, lost billions going in a radical, incompetent fast-paced direction re solar & would not allow oil drilling to be expanded. He's a serial liar.
6567 2018-11-29 14:35:34 @LeBatardShow put it on the poll... "Do you tip at hotels when you leave?" personally I've never heard of such a thing, excluding room service etc. Same thing with oil change /inspection shops... Tips?

6570 2018-11-29 14:35:31 Unfortunately, former President Obama has a distorted view of his accomplishments. He is taking credit for our country’s economic boom when he clearly stated, while in office, that it couldn’t be done. Now, he is the oil savior. Mr. President, you are embarrassing yourself.
6571 2018-11-29 14:35:29 No she won't challenge @POTUS @realDonaldTrump with "new ideas," she'll undermine what's left of #America1st with old failed #Neocon snake oil.

Unfortunately appointing @marykissel isn't risky for @SecPompeo at all. Being anti #Trump is practically de rigeur.
6572 2018-11-29 14:35:23 And we can get an oil change while in the tap room?

6575 2018-11-29 14:35:16 @cspanwj  Yes use the resource that is most plentiful and cheapest for the people, coal, gas and oil!  Man will do nothing to control climate, it’s the proverbial pie in the sky!

6579 2018-11-29 14:34:56 Lol , I can't try that ooo
6580 2018-11-29 14:34:46 International oil prices are decreasing
6581 2018-11-29 14:34:41 Coal? When Scotland has alternative energy sources? I would rather oil stayed in the ground also but little or no progress being made on electric vehicles presently. Whisky a different matter, step up production.
6582 2018-11-29 14:34:35 Well it’s better than nothing and given the crisis we have to pull out all stops including shipping by rail as it will take forever to build pipelines in this country.  Rail is not the best solution but it closes the differential into the end of the year on a flat oil price curve
6583 2018-11-29 14:34:25 *Crude Oil Recovers After Dipping Below $50*

Oil recovered from earlier losses to move above $50 a barrel Thursday, after reports that Russian officials are signaling the likelihood of a production cut in tandem with Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.

6587 2018-11-29 14:34:11 Yep, we make sure every kind of bird has food and water. Bird seed, black oil sunflower, safflower, nyjer, shelled peanuts, peanuts in-shell, suet, peanut butter, jelly, oranges...and that's just the list off the top of my head 
6588 2018-11-29 14:34:06 Yes there's plenty of footage showing Oil Panic reflecting projectiles

6590 2018-11-29 14:33:59 I'm gone get my oil change at Walmart and probably buy some more shit
6591 2018-11-29 14:33:54 No fill Thursday.  I had a TYZ18 trade that hit entry, but not filled by Trade Station.  The prices on H contracts don't match up yet.  UGH.  Oh, yeah, Oil long at 49.35 missed by just a tick or two.  Love watching moves without me.
6592 2018-11-29 14:33:49 my friends call me olive oil,, because i’m extra virgin

6595 2018-11-29 14:33:36 Lol the motor oil is what really hurts my heart. Like y’all just wasting food. 
6596 2018-11-29 14:33:35 From what I heard this morning, most of the credit for increasing oil production goes to the states who approved applications. Obama meanwhile, was the anti oil, closing the Gulf for 6 months. Let's not forget what happened with the keystone pipeline....
6597 2018-11-29 14:33:35 Yeah, all those billions and billions of taxpayer money they give to the oil companies, buying the TMX, stating a new pipeline is "in the national interest" and on and on, is refusing to act.

6599 2018-11-29 14:33:24 It is expected that EVs will have four times the lifespan of ICEs, will not require servicing (no oil), So the effect  is to quarter the manufacturing, reduce service and dealerships by ?, reduce gas stations by? If this all happens in ten years, we are in for major change

6601 2018-11-29 14:33:11 The smell of vegetable oil brings back some vivid memories. Like when my brother and I would grease our paintball guns with it and then would blast the shit out of each other at point blank range for no god damn reason other than entertainment during summer break
6602 2018-11-29 14:33:10 Sounds like O’Bama has become delusional. He worked hard to destroy oil production as well as middle class jobs. But, everyone knows exactly what he did consistently to destroy America. Look at our children’s education that failed under him.

6605 2018-11-29 14:33:03 Trudeau fixated on killing Alberta's oil and gas industry. There is a simple solution. Step in and get pipelines built. Alberta needs a Peter Lougheed. Jason Kenny?
6606 2018-11-29 14:32:50 I live in Minnesota, where many have Norwegian heritage. Recent stories about oil, Norwegian Refugee Council/Yemen, lutefisk (xmas is coming!), climate change. Norway mentioned often in obituaries of old farmers.

6609 2018-11-29 14:32:37 Such a lie. He did everything he could to prevent oil production. Can’t believe he can sit there and make those statements. That should tell you something about the mans ethics and integrity.

6611 2018-11-29 14:32:34 You didn’t frack that! 
6612 2018-11-29 14:32:19 Trump wants to knock down oil price and lower the interest rising rate ... to fight the trade war.
6613 2018-11-29 14:32:17 i’ve never been so dry/flakey in my life.... i’ve been dowsing myself in coconut oil, lotion, chapstick, and face lotion and its only keeping my from cracking apart bc i’m still so dry.

6617 2018-11-29 14:32:04 This is my biggest worry Jim,that they drive scots to bombs to get what we voted for.
I cant see them respecting scots when they have planned brexit on 40 further years of oil revenue.
Scots need to be in EU so they cant fuck with scots trade or steal our resources.
6618 2018-11-29 14:32:01 All the nurses say im calm af under pressure but what they don’t know is tha I have to take CBD oil before my shifts to keep me from having an anxiety induced stroke.
6619 2018-11-29 14:32:00 @realDonaldTrump I'm not happy with actual low oil price. Actual price aren't sustainable for US producers and OPEC+ knows, they can maintain this price only to bankrupt more US oil producers and you because of misunderstanding help they.
6620 2018-11-29 14:31:55 If CBD oil has any affect at all (the placebo rate is high) it will be due to its antioxidant and EFA effect.
6621 2018-11-29 14:31:54 Baby oil اييواه 
6622 2018-11-29 14:31:47 Thanks :) My position hasn’t changed. Although now I believe the oil is probably buried under a data lake! It’s like data kleptomania - he or she who has the most data when they die, wins...
6623 2018-11-29 14:31:40 OIL 1H as markets open surges back above 50MA, bullish break, bull signal. UWT ?
6624 2018-11-29 14:31:37 Hmm and what about that oil deal?

6639 2018-11-29 14:30:18 What’s your estimate of “energy price swing neutral” core PCED?  Because I suspect we’re going to see “regular” core PCED dip in the coming months if these oil price declines stick
6640 2018-11-29 14:30:14 How much more would we have had to borrow if we hadn't had the oil revenue? How much higher would taxes have had to have been? Norway has a miniscule population, and for years was the second largest oil exporter in the world after Saudi. Its situation is unique.
6641 2018-11-29 14:30:09 @narendramodi @narendramodi_in I can't understand the strategy of Opposition. When the oil prices rose, blame govt ( Justified) . Now Oil prices coming down, even now also they blame govt. What a comedy!!
6642 2018-11-29 14:30:01 @Ciarabballgirl that oil you knew wasn't syrup, not so silky smooth no longer
6643 2018-11-29 14:29:56 US crude oil falls below $50! #SUACCF18 #wow
6644 2018-11-29 14:29:54 @BillGrimsey after drilling for oil you hve to leave the environment as good as it was when you arrived. @marksandspencer can leave a town after 80 years of ‘taking their oil’ and just leave a huge hole in the ground @AlexMcRetail
6645 2018-11-29 14:29:53 TL;DR. I gather the essence is that all this coconut oil isn't any better than lard. Article buried lede.
6646 2018-11-29 14:29:52 Pressure on EU to act is increasing every day.
Sanctions alone won't work and EU won't agree to death penalty sanctions on Rusaian oil and gas anyways.
6647 2018-11-29 14:29:51 I have a car question, it seems like every time I get an oil change they suggest I get a new air filter. I’ve never had this problem with my other   cars and my other cars were older. Why is this?
6648 2018-11-29 14:29:46 My car really been acting up on me.. more than usual. It could be cause I need to get an oil change and other various reasons. But, I’ll just blame it on the cold weather
6649 2018-11-29 14:29:34 Oil embargoes. Getting people to go along with 55 speed limit still amazes me. But we did it. I still remember him on TV in a sweater asking everyone to set their thermostats to 68. We did that too
6650 2018-11-29 14:29:31 #Canada is spinning into separation debate again Denise. This time it's our energy producing western provinces vs Ottawa. Trudeau is trying to shut down our oil and gas sector at the #UN's behest. #cdnpoli
6651 2018-11-29 14:29:31 Oil? Lol
6652 2018-11-29 14:29:20 My poor car has a serious oil leak so she's at the shop getting fixed which means I'm at home all day.. it's the perfect day to catch up on stuff around the house!
6653 2018-11-29 14:29:19 So idk if this coconut oil I’ve been using is helping with that.
6654 2018-11-29 14:29:18 Not to burst anyone’s happy bubble, but if we take Saudi production at 11.3 mbpd this month then OPEC is overproducing it’s original ceiling by ~ 1.55 mbpd (possibly more) so a total OPEC+ cut of 1 mbpd will still leave plenty of oil on market
6655 2018-11-29 14:29:17 You are for not accepting that oil has other uses than fuel.

I wouldn't choose to comment on the broader point of you being fab or otherwise as I don't know you well enough to give an informed view.
6656 2018-11-29 14:29:12 The retailer price is set by the oil price
6657 2018-11-29 14:29:12 The most obvious problem with this article.. “GM’s announcement sends a message to the oil industry that it should continue to research alternative fuels and make cars that are more fuel efficient,” Swiecki said.  I guess Petrobras could make cars in the old paper mill
6658 2018-11-29 14:29:11 and when the oil runs out the co2 emissions will end and the planet will self regulate 
with trees sequestering excess co2. The greatest threat to our civilization is over populations but the fake news media do not want to talk about that because corporations want more consumers
6659 2018-11-29 14:29:10 You can’t tell me that @realDonaldTrump letting or ordering that poor reporter murder didn’t bring on a deal with the oil companies. The prices dropped too fast here
6660 2018-11-29 14:29:06 Just to show to people who say: "He's no oil painting"
6661 2018-11-29 14:29:06 “We know that getting this pipeline done in the right way is what will advantage the sector and allow clean, Canadian oil and gas resources to create advantage around the world,” Morneau told Bloomberg
6662 2018-11-29 14:29:05 Oil & Saudi our gas prices holiday savings.We are in a spot that we need some alliance to Saudi.We have a whole like oars in the water & must navigate a path to keep peace.

6671 2018-11-29 14:28:26 It was, I believe, an exec of Mega? Oil. He was on CBCs Heather Hiscix show this morning. 
6672 2018-11-29 14:28:24 Macadamia nut oil> Olive oil ???
6673 2018-11-29 14:28:23 Well, Putin outsmarts Trump again! Welcome OPEC + Saudi Arabia partners with Russia and Russia leads the Partnership. RUSSIA & SAUDI Create the World leadership of OIL & GAS AND WILL CONTROL THE PRICES OF THE MOST TRADED COMMODITY IN THE WORLD. I think this is fantastic news!!!
6674 2018-11-29 14:28:18 Wait, I thought Libs were against drilling and more oil production. Will the left disown him now? 

Hypocrites
6675 2018-11-29 14:28:05 Or....we could just wait for the yearly seasonal glut of oil to deplete now that turn around season it done and upgraders are back online. Instead of knee jerking our way into stupid decisions for political expediency.
6676 2018-11-29 14:28:02 Maybe it's the spray tan.  Maybe they finish off with a spritz of oil.....motor oil, that is.

6678 2018-11-29 14:27:38 My favorite part is “we’re the big oil producer”! Meanwhile during his reign of terror the United States imports over 7 million barrels per day of crude. Unh? Cognitive dissonance?

6680 2018-11-29 14:27:29 Under Obama we became energy independent, and exported oil. We also began to install renewable energy everywhere in our country creating far more jobs than exist in the Hydrocarbon industry. The only real thing that Obama did to provoke the ire of Republicans: Black POTUS in WH.

6686 2018-11-29 14:26:59 The fed still has a job to do. Isn't oil non-core? You been to the grocery store recently? Insurance up & people want decent cars when the ones they drive turn to lemons(+tariffs). The cost of 12 hours of courses at LSU (Go Tigers!) cost @ $1100 in 1995. Now, UNO $1400 for 3hrs.

6702 2018-11-29 14:26:02 Obama is on a speaking tour claiming everything from the good economy to record USA oil production is because of his policies. The truth is Obama should have recruited Donald Trump to be his chief of staff if he had truly wanted to have a successful presidency.

- Oil dip <50 & back above
- Scale & trail existing longs

6734 2018-11-29 14:23:29 We remain attentive to oil prices and the previous low of 58.40 in Brent breaking may signal further weakness for oil-sensitive currencies like CAD.
6735 2018-11-29 14:23:22 I wouldn't go so far as every last drop, as at see point, trying to get the oil will become so price prohibitive, that another energy source will have to be considered. Though as you've pointed out, it will be too late by then (if it isn't already too late, which it might be).

6838 2018-11-29 14:15:13 I'm just pointing that the data you presented shows that in 1980, 6 years after the oil crisis and 8 years after a movment for more infrastructure, there was , nationwide, 9000km of bike infrastructure. That somehow seems to be an argument to speak about the decline of bike use

6898 2018-11-29 14:11:12 That can’t be true. Some of his oil block licenses were renewed recently. Think he is just paying back the favour
6899 2018-11-29 14:11:06 That’s quite a neat trick when he gives a speech to the greens who adore him he can claim credit,just shows you what a bit of charm and a word salad can do,same with the oil guys.
Win win all round.

6900 2018-11-29 14:11:00 But oil prices are going down so...
6901 2018-11-29 14:10:57 Generally bland means unseasoned, unmarinated, grilled not fried, and no sauce. So with a salad you could have it tossed in oil and lemon juice, and that’s it. Bread toasted without any spread, vegetables with no ranch, etc

6954 2018-11-29 14:05:54 Can we survive if CO2 emissions continue apace? Time to move on from oil. High oil prices are actually a sign of hope for our survival.
6955 2018-11-29 14:05:48 On top of this we’ve got lower oil prices, boosting nearly every sector of economy. When gas is high everyone complains, now that it’s under control not a peep. It’s a WIN for all!

And the Country/Countries who control the World's Oil dictates how everyone on Earth lives.
6969 2018-11-29 14:04:37 Oil below $50. Who would have thought so earlier this summer.
6970 2018-11-29 14:04:35 $cei  AND YET OIL IS TRYING TO STAY GREEN

6972 2018-11-29 14:04:27 I winder what will happen with oil investments now? Hmm? And what will be the subsequent effect on oil price? Hmm?
6973 2018-11-29 14:04:26 We roughly pay $6 usd for a gallon of gas in the Caribbean. So that low price of oil don't benefit me
6974 2018-11-29 14:04:24 Trump sees no problem bad mouthing and alienating Canada who is by far our largest oil importers.  
But the killers of Saudi Arabia are ok in his book.
6975 2018-11-29 14:04:23 Obama did noting but put a drag on energy production and the economy. The states drove the increase in oil production and now Trump is supporting the states thru  deregulation. Obama just about destroyed America.
6976 2018-11-29 14:04:23 Ok done insert your iklan there right haha BUT ESSENTIAL OIL REALLY HELP MY RESDUNG  truu
6977 2018-11-29 14:04:14 Agreed. 
And some are developing self driving transport trucks - diesel run. 
Our infrastructure is so depend on combustibles it will take time to evolve. Length depends on political will but not less than 25 yrs. 
Even then, we use plastic, fertilizer, etc we need oil 4 years

6988 2018-11-29 14:03:25 Says the man who refused to allow the keystone pipeline and restricted drilling on all but private land. We are a top oil producer IN SPITE of you not because of you. For a guy who spent 8 years blaming everyone else , he certainly loves claiming unearned accolades today.
6989 2018-11-29 14:03:13 “His feelings for Adam were an oil spill; he’d let them overflow and now there wasn’t a damn place in the ocean that wouldn’t catch fire if he dropped a match.”
6990 2018-11-29 14:03:13 So he opened the Keyston XL Pipeline, increased permits 4 fracking & off shore drilling?  No! What I remember is Obama vehemently blocked oil production, killed coal production, put strangling regulations on energy producers & called businesses his enemy.
6991 2018-11-29 14:03:11 Mine Thorium.  Make Thorium Reactors. Replace oil with alternative noncarbon energy. 
We need to let go of our old ways and develop new noncarbon sources of energy production...
6992 2018-11-29 14:03:03 Likely choppy today. Mixed signals. $AAPL suddenly popular again after 1 good day. Oil making a frantic rebound. DXY holding up. Guessing today Powell’s dovish about face as good news will erode.

6994 2018-11-29 14:02:51 Is that why I got laid off from an oil company while you were President? You can say it and foolish people will believe it but you can’t convince anyone else you smug arrogant jerk.
6995 2018-11-29 14:02:46 Buying rail cars to move oil so we can sell even more at a discount is just giving it away. To honestly say it will raise the price of bitumen by $4 is just a $$ grab. Taxpayer $$ to fund oil companies again....#turnoffthetaps

7011 2018-11-29 14:01:29 With retreating oil prices, inflation is likely to be lower world wide. Will Independent Central bankers world wide be able to take a step bank and reduce interest rates, or will they doggedly insist on piercing growth?

7031 2018-11-29 13:59:05 Why this justification: "Considering continuous fall in international prices of Petrol and Diesel, Indian Oil Corporation (IndianOil) has been continuously reducing the prices of petrol and diesel in the domestic market for about one-and-a-half months now.," @IndianOilcl says

7044 2018-11-29 13:57:51 Building an EV infrastructure and incentivizing auto companies to do so is imperative! Besides $3 billion is a drop in the bucket compared to the subsidies provided to coal and oil over the last 100 years to which we are now fighting the affects of.
7045 2018-11-29 13:57:45 The abundance in resources some nations have sometimes astounds me. Saudi Arabia and their oil, India and their diamonds, Canada and their uranium, and of course Los Angeles with their muscle gays.
7046 2018-11-29 13:57:42 What has happened since he left office? Under President Donald Trump, U.S. oil production broke all previous records with 11.7 million barrels per day in November, making America the world's largest oil producer this year.
7047 2018-11-29 13:57:38 Of course they had to jawbone OIL out of 49. Come on now. This shouldn’t shock you. #oott

7049 2018-11-29 13:57:33 Obama is referencing the fact that U.S. oil production increased by almost 100 % during his presidency, although he omits the amount of regulation he imposed on oil production on federal lands during that time. Much of that production increase came from state and private land.
7050 2018-11-29 13:57:21 I wanted to throw a brick at my tv last nite when Obama trying to take credit for oil & gas industry comeback, people can’t be that stupid-they just can’t be!
7051 2018-11-29 13:57:20 If demand destruction hits oil the lowest cost producer should still survive to service the remaining need. But the lowest cost producer should not be determined solely by domestic Labour costs.
7052 2018-11-29 13:57:14 Canada defined by advanced industries—which include industries as diverse as auto and aerospace production,oil and gas extraction, and information technology—are the high-value innovation & technology application industries that inordinately drive regional and national prosperity

7054 2018-11-29 13:57:04 It always boggles my mind how so many male singers from Kerala (and parts of Karnataka culturally influenced by Kerala) have a voice texture so similar to Yesudas. I'd argue that they  they all idolise Yesudas or it's the coconut oil effect.
7055 2018-11-29 13:56:51 Not the main reason Patriotic Paul? President's have about as much influence on big oil as does Mickey Mouse. It's not fact Sir. Demographic's also play a role, hence, " your comment on visiting family in Louisiana and making the observation's on this disparity.

7061 2018-11-29 13:56:16 I would love to see the bottom drop out of the oil market. I would love for the world to wake up and reduce their comsumption to the bare minimum.
7062 2018-11-29 13:56:07 Nah you're good bro. Every mechanic knows that 'oil changes' r a scam made up by Big Oil.

7091 2018-11-29 13:53:47 True. And governments need to figure out the impacts of this energy evolution to renewables. Jobs will disappear. New ones will dominate. We only have about 25 years to get this right.

7093 2018-11-29 13:53:37 The problem here is oil companies and eletric companies get fucked if we start using only clean energy. give patents of solar panels and shit to them and they reverse global warning in seconds. its all about the money baby and it always will be.

7097 2018-11-29 13:53:27 It was nothing like I'd ever seen or smelled before! It was amaziiiing...it had a plant in it & the perfume itself was more oil than anything else. The bottle was long with a skinny neck that curved. It came in a wooden box that had a sliding lid. I can NOT remember the name 
7098 2018-11-29 13:53:27 The DoD and CIA have both determined global warming to be our most pressing long term national security issue. Water will be the new oil.

7102 2018-11-29 13:52:59 Its a mystery to me why Nigeria hasn't developed despite having plenty of oil. They should strike a deal with someone who needs it in return for something which Nigeria wants.
7103 2018-11-29 13:52:47 Soooo I got peppermint oil in my eye this morning.. 1. Worst pain ever 2. I’ll prob lose my eyesight. It’s fine, I’m fine 
7104 2018-11-29 13:52:42 Don’t towel dry it! Put on t shirt after you shower and let it air dry. Sleep with coconut oil in it once a week! Use Moroccan oil. And drink lots of water! Give it 30 days you’ll see a world of a difference.

7107 2018-11-29 13:52:37 For Obama to claim any credit for what happened in the US oil industry is the height of hypocrisy. To be gullible enough to defend his narcissistic BS is the height of willful ignorance.
7108 2018-11-29 13:52:35 Russia influence is not by the size of its GDP. It’s about nukes and oil.
7109 2018-11-29 13:52:24 @cspanwj Climate Change is a Bonanza of wealth if only we went that way...But old Oil and Coal want to use up the very last bit before changing to something new, or should I say Renewable?
7110 2018-11-29 13:52:24 Obama is confused. 
He was a large “gas producer”. America is now a large “oil producer”. There is no connection between The two.
7111 2018-11-29 13:52:13 It can be misleading I have found Heidi... as the ask may rise a lot on small volumes like today  but the bid not .. so in theory is there is one sell at close the real gain is minimal unless the bid rises it’s all smoke and mirrors by MMs
7112 2018-11-29 13:52:03 Use tee tree oil on them if you start getting keloids
7113 2018-11-29 13:52:00 inflação menor....ate vc esta falando ja...kkkk mes que vem estará menor, crb index, oil, dólar forte, tudo puxa para baixo!!!
7114 2018-11-29 13:51:53 If @BarackObama is taking credit for making USA the biggest oil producer in the world, Isn't that a good reason for liberals and  progressives to reject him?
I mean U liberals believe in going green, global warming and all your BS.
7115 2018-11-29 13:51:52 Oil on your body works wonders during the winter time because lotion is trash for the dryness
7116 2018-11-29 13:51:41 Arabs' historical & semantic distortions have no end. Another idiotic "Palestinianism" is that Bir-Zeit for instance was named because Arab Palestinians stored their ExtraVirginOliveOil in wells dug up in the dirt. Ever heard of this gastronomic device of storing oil in dirt ;)

7120 2018-11-29 13:51:03 The oil companies can be greedy but they still have to deal with the current market prices.  They are terrible business manages as well.
7121 2018-11-29 13:50:56 I would call it pal and offer whatever oil it fancies for its articulations. #Buddy

7125 2018-11-29 13:50:26 I like Trump and I believe he has been able to convince Saudi Arabia to lower oil prices, which is good.

I don't watch @FoxNews but it is interesting thay they haven't tweeted in 3 weeks. I wonder what is up with that.

7128 2018-11-29 13:50:12 Obama Keeps insulting the Black American community by talking to them like they are stupid. When, of course, everyone already knows what the real deal is living here in America. "Hustling you and me for money." Do you believe Oil prices are falling because of Barack Obama?
7129 2018-11-29 13:50:12 Each heat pump installed through these programs reduces oil consumption by 1,000L which is equivalent to 2.75 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions.
7130 2018-11-29 13:50:03 If the oil & gas industry owners are perpetuating lies to bring war in regions they want oil, what else will they lie about?
7131 2018-11-29 13:50:02 Thanks Callum! See you Sunday ....will you have olive oil pearls ? 
7132 2018-11-29 13:50:00 M.P. Is 100% correct!

Like the Economy, O could NOT have been responsible for current success in oil production!

REASON: Like the Economy, O *destroyed* the BASIC TOOLS AND MECHANISMS NECESSARY TO MAKE THEM SUCCESSFUL!

O is a weasel-sneak, stealing other’s achievements!

7134 2018-11-29 13:49:41 US oil production ramped up quickly due to a technological advancement known as fracking, IN SPITE OF Obama and his “I’ve got a pen and a phone” regulatory malfeasance. He did everything he could to kill the oil and coal industry so he could give his green energy buds a lift.

7139 2018-11-29 13:49:27 The same way potus obeezy is responsible for all good things oil,,, the american Soviet socialist party (ass party) is full of liars and  it really needs to be said - pure evil.
7140 2018-11-29 13:49:23 Slowly, the workers that bought his snake oil and are now losing their jobs will begin to realize that he is a liar.
7141 2018-11-29 13:49:22 True but SA MBS has to have higher oil for him to maintain control and not lose his head!   That may carry more weight than appeasing trump.

Income from oil doesn’t even cover cost for Health
7157 2018-11-29 13:48:13 Apologies I went a bit off topic .

Back to normality. 

#OIL done a massive intra-day reversal .

For transparency you’ll notice I didn’t comment on #RLM 7-8am because I sold first thing at 10.50p, was always ST for me. Have sold #CORO 2.5p & #BOIL 0.43p of late too.
7158 2018-11-29 13:48:11 I think you should consider moving. Oil deserves to die. Auto industry needs reimagination. Tech sector is thriving actually. Youth wave taking over from you boomers who’d like to see no future for the next Gen. Stay in that dark cloud amigo,
7159 2018-11-29 13:48:10 @BarackObama  Your comments are beyond funny. We citizens laughed at you for hours taking credit for oil prices. First you had nothing to do with it. Each individual state managed their own oil production. You and your Natzi ran EPA put so many restrictions on all energy
7160 2018-11-29 13:48:07 Obama did everything he could to fight oil and shale production in the US. He squandered BILLIONS on Green Energy. He is a miserable failure and claiming otherwise is just a plain lie.

7172 2018-11-29 13:47:04 Sure, that’s why Obama sent our  US oil refineries over to South America. This guy cannot stop lying!

7174 2018-11-29 13:46:39 Blended with snake oil.
7175 2018-11-29 13:46:37 It's easy for Barack to go to Rice U, & take credit for the increase in US oil production, (he said we can not drill our way to oil independence) with not feed back. I would ask Barack to go to a Oil Company Convention & say the same thing, & see what feed back he gets.

7182 2018-11-29 13:46:24 Obama was 'fortunate' to have the BP oil spill so he could immediately stop all offshore drilling.....something he promised he would do.
7183 2018-11-29 13:46:23 I was so sad to know that there are so many names of the same stuff. So things I thought were palm oil free may not be

7185 2018-11-29 13:46:03 Delivered in a plethora of promises: conservative judges, deregulation so USA can export more oil, lower taxes, end Iran deal, end Paris accord, etc.
7186 2018-11-29 13:46:02 U.S. crude oil stockpiles rose for a 10th week in a row last week even as refineries boosted output and exports increased #EIA. Crude inventories rose 3.6 million barrels in the week to Nov. 23, compared with analysts' expectations for an increase of 769,000 barrels.
7187 2018-11-29 13:46:01 Here’s what’s true: Obama never supported oil, natural gas or coal during his presidency - and the regulations Obama put on oil, gas and coal were removed by Trump.
Private land/leases and those regulations removed are why we are #1 now - Obama sucked (sucks) hard.

Not one of them would say that President Obama helped them during his presidency. Actually, it’s quite the opposite. Doesn’t mean I dislike him. But he’s delusional here
7235 2018-11-29 13:42:29 Since you were a president and not a king, production of oil grew in SPITE of you not because of you....
7236 2018-11-29 13:42:23 Even better. Come with a he goat, a bag of rice, a carton of tin tomatoes, 25 litre groundnut oil, and a carton of Turkey. We need to appease the gods

7239 2018-11-29 13:42:18 So does he want to be known for increasing oil production every year of his presidency or reducing the carbon footprint #cannothaveitbothways #doofus
7240 2018-11-29 13:42:17 I wonder how much US oil money get channeled to Christian churches, missionaries, and schools these days...?

7243 2018-11-29 13:41:57 Financial structure wise $oil is in a good spot. Pushed down viciously by algos and firms needing to deleverage. Add in the recent long $NG and short oil trade.

7373 2018-11-29 13:31:12 Rupee ended stronger against the US Dollar. The Rupee jumped 80 paise to breach the 70 per Dollar mark and touched 69.81, a three-month high level intraday amid sustained selling of the greenback by exporters and easing crude oil prices.
7374 2018-11-29 13:31:11 No one in I ever met where I lived did oil paintings of people, No one I ever met where I lived did digital illustration. I even got to talk to some trailblazers I knew personally and pushed THEM to do digital.
7375 2018-11-29 13:31:11 Engine oil in cold temps = high viscosity hard to circulate if oil doesnt reach the top of the piston that engine is gone so please invest in a remote starter and warm your vehicles
7376 2018-11-29 13:31:10 This guy tells so many lies that he believes them.  He stopped the producing of oil!
7377 2018-11-29 13:31:10 This has been Putin's plan all along.
The oil deal he made with Trump and Tillerson is worth billions and they won't let anything stop them. Poor Ukraine.
7378 2018-11-29 13:31:04 Show me the Money! Stock market is crashing! GM is shutting down factories! Tariffs are Taxes! Oil prices are going up! Middle class is getting nothing from Tax Cuts! Where is the prosperity we were promised?
7379 2018-11-29 13:31:01 Yes oil boom was from American ingenuity, like fracking, all inspire of Obama.
7380 2018-11-29 13:30:56 Government bond prices ended higher today as crude oil prices fell sharply. Strength in Rupee coupled with higher-than-expected cut-off price set by RBI at today's 100-bln-rupee OMO buy auction supported the bond prices.
7381 2018-11-29 13:30:53 @INOXMovies Please dnt play with the health of people. #Inox  elements Jaipur, they are using wastage oil to fry the potato & all other item. While we checked they said it's the best oil we are using but they dnt have even name of that. The oil is so dark just like a Greece oil.
7382 2018-11-29 13:30:50 From that, the movement "stop murdering our children" came to life, which in conjunction with the oil crisis of 1973, led the government to BEGIN to create infrastructure, which takes time. What happens from 1973 on your graph ? The modal share of the bike starts to rise again.

7384 2018-11-29 13:30:46 maybe they blocked you to not see your posts so sending them apology would be adding oil to fire. And if you dont know why they blocked you what for would you apologise?

7386 2018-11-29 13:30:43 Trudeau will rescue this just like he did with the oil industry.
7387 2018-11-29 13:30:42 Negative a car can run with no oil for 5 to 10min
7388 2018-11-29 13:30:40 Benchmark indices BSE Sensex and NSE’s Nifty 50 ended higher today. A stronger Rupee, tumbling crude oil prices coupled with a dovish commentary from the US central bank chief instilled confidence in the markets across the globe, including India.
7389 2018-11-29 13:30:40 Oh, it is one thing that they were up y/y, but more than in October? State divergence definitely seems to be a story, though re your point. Heating oil CPI down Saxony, but up, 51.1% y/y in Bavaria!.

7396 2018-11-29 13:30:03 Actually no, Trump receded one of your laws against oil production and that's when it went up. trying to take recognition you do not deserve.

7406 2018-11-29 13:29:11 I'll say thank you TO TRUMP.  Obummer did everything he could to destroy the US oil industry,  both onshore and offshore.  Trump removed Obummer's regulations and the industry boomed.
7407 2018-11-29 13:29:05 Then why is Canadian WSC so cheap to the point of giving it away, if US needs it so much to blend with the light shale oil to increase density?
7408 2018-11-29 13:29:01 Thanks for the oil. The planet's wild life and climate appreciate it. I could say the same for my nation, luckily we're more concerned with electric and renewables now.
7409 2018-11-29 13:28:56 Russia's willingness to work with SA on #oil cuts saved the 50 break stop run we both knew would happen.
7410 2018-11-29 13:28:52 That's great now can you get them to stop using palm oil. You need to make this your new mission!
7411 2018-11-29 13:28:50 Yes, you idiot: while the first 20.000 km of segregated lanes were built. The segregated lanes have no bearing whatsoever on cycling, and it onle picked up (a little) after the oil crisis for reasons completely unrelated.

7434 2018-11-29 13:27:03 With oil at just over $50, we are still paying Rs.75 per litre for petrol. The last time it was $50, we were paying around Rs.50. And the headlines today say 'Petrol price lowest in 8 months."
7435 2018-11-29 13:26:59 In China we were invited to a dinner to  meet with some big CEO & their 17yr autistic son to pray for him. Well, it got so violent, they had to leave, the mom pleaded for help, I said coconut oil 6x a day, she called 1 week later, to say the violence was gone! He was much quieter
7436 2018-11-29 13:26:57 I have included all the North Sea oil in Scottish waters in my figures. And Trident would take the gap from about £2500 per person per year down to about £2460. (It wouldn't go down quite that far as there would be extra unemployment benefits to pay.)

7447 2018-11-29 13:25:52 How can you say that? He said Examples Nigeria is enriched with natural resources of oil but still poverty existent. Means corruption is the main cause. How are you comparing Imran Khan 3 months with 70 years libidos? You must visit a psychiatrist, please.

7517 2018-11-29 13:21:13 Big Oil receives $400 billion in annual subsidies by taxpayers. Please tell me how much the green sector receives.
7518 2018-11-29 13:20:59 Seems like it takes a GM plant closure in Oshawa to awaken everyone regarding the $80mil/day being lost In “CANADIAN” Oil royalties. Wonder what our neighbours in Welfare Quebec will do if their $11.7B Equalization Payment is reduced!

7528 2018-11-29 13:20:22 Yes, the same question? As for me, there was nothing visible in the beginning of 2017 for the heights of oil price this year. Today a huge drop... Interesting.

7530 2018-11-29 13:20:13 German energy inflation UP in November; only logical explanation is that jump in nat gas prices offset plunge in oil prices. This shouldn't be the case for the EZ as a whole.
7531 2018-11-29 13:20:10 Guys, you hardly see me recommend stuff here but nah, discovering the beauty that is peppermint oil has changed my life.  I use this stuff on my face, skin, on my head to calm my nerves and even for some interesting activities in the bedroom. Highly recommended.

7542 2018-11-29 13:19:11 When it comes to “climate” science, all you have to do is follow the money, on both sides of the debate. It’s funny though, how pure many people believe “academic” scientists to be, as if who holds their purse strings are any different than those who work for an oil company.

7552 2018-11-29 13:18:21 Good question. The big EM moves happened from 2014 on, when oil and other commodity prices fell sharply and many emerging markets weakened as a result. It was also in 2014 that the big Dollar rise started. But your point is perfectly valid.

7554 2018-11-29 13:18:10 Farmer Agitation: While I have sympathy for their cause, Asking for full loan waiver and  1.5 times the cost of production is too much. Agriculture produce is also a commodity like coal, iron ore, oil etc. Farmers do not pay taxes, get subsidized electricity/ fertilizer.

7565 2018-11-29 13:17:08 True in most cases. A president almost never has effect on oil prices. Here, however, it was Trump's influence over the Saudis that caused the drop. Look it up.

7644 2018-11-29 13:09:23 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
7645 2018-11-29 13:09:22 Reading through peoples comments.. Melatonin can cause crazy ass dreams, do not recommend.  CBD oil is good, do recommend.  Weighted blankets get HOT fyi.  Benadryl can help with both sleep and RLS.
7646 2018-11-29 13:09:16 That damn Saturn oil for breakout prone skin. All those great fake reviews and it broke me out so much worse.
7647 2018-11-29 13:09:14 Thanks for assisting in reducing the carbon footprint as nearly 90 percent of the aluminum, on average, is recycled. Compared with traditional steel vehicles, aluminum use also helps in saving barrels of crude oil in energy.

7648 2018-11-29 13:09:09 I would have fully expected everyone to campaign against a successful Yes vote when the oil price collapsed. Or even if it hadn't. And Brexiteers would never have shut up if they had lost, especially by so close a margin. Farage even stated that.

7650 2018-11-29 13:09:06 The dealership called to say my SLK 500 Turbo is due for an oil change. I asked how soon they could come out and do it, and they told me I have to drive it to the dealership! Absurd!

You have TDS!
7660 2018-11-29 13:08:30 Ok Mr. Nose  in the air , you had NOTHING to do with the oil boom .
7661 2018-11-29 13:08:18 Amazing how he spins everything.  He blocked Anwar drilling, stopped fracking on public lands and would not let us build the pipeline but somehow he made us the greatest oil and gas producer.

7665 2018-11-29 13:07:56 Thanks to tax happy @JayInslee and @WALegislators--all on this "climate change" kick and convinced that the world is ending--Washington isn't seeing the full effect of the dip in oil prices.

7668 2018-11-29 13:07:41 Riyadh just announced in cooperation with Russia an oil production cut of 1 million barrels. 

Your two best friends are trying to raise our oil prices. Still think MBS killing a journalist was ok cause Saudis love us?

7670 2018-11-29 13:07:11 If oil stops or slows down declining, then that's a positive for Shell & BP, which is a big positive for the FTSE. The FTSE has held up fairly well, considering the battering oil has taken these last few weeks
7671 2018-11-29 13:07:08 At what point should Canada expect Alberta to cease producing oil? When we collectively set that date and create a plan for future prosperity then Alberta might be blamed for not signing on. Until then, Alberta should be expected to look to it's own prosperity via oil.
7672 2018-11-29 13:07:05 Not comparing to BMW’s or Mercedes, there’s no comparison, US trucks can carry them. Americans went away from trucks because of Peak Oil lie, going back in droves. Mercedes & BMW’s are taxis in Europe (lower level models). Has everyone forgotten Germany’s emissions scandals (VW).
7673 2018-11-29 13:06:55 The fingerprints of the PPT were oil killed with DOW up 617. Every fake market day leaves traces of DNA from our market riggers.
7674 2018-11-29 13:06:53 I agree Eddie. I occasionally try to fry my own buttermilk chicken tenders and the mess, headache, and  lingering oil smell are always an issue. Plus fried chicken is best cooked in a commercial deep fryer (in my opinion)

7681 2018-11-29 13:05:39 "Oil Demand will keep growing" according to the New Scientist  17th November 2018. IEA (International Energy Agency) expects continued growth for global demand in oil. Energy demand will double in India but slow down in China who is still expected to be the biggest oil consumer

7692 2018-11-29 13:03:49 Saudis and Russia want big cuts on oil production.
7693 2018-11-29 13:03:43 Sounds like Russia made a bulk sale to the Chinese as they pivoted away from buying US oil and that’s why they might go along with cuts.  

Can someone bug Putin with a microphone for the MBS convo at G20?   I’d like to hear that.

7732 2018-11-29 12:59:16 and we will get a demand boost in the US from cold weather unless its accompanied by huge snow falls which will hurt driving.  And net net, world GDP still growing at a healthy clip which should keep world oil demand around 1.3 to 1.6/mmbd of growth YoY.  we will see tho.

7742 2018-11-29 12:58:20 Certainly looks that way.
But wait, Scotlands exports leave English ports, and is ticked off as 'English exports'.

They take sentences about *public perception* out of context in a carefully selected manner to mislead uneducated/gullible persons.

7789 2018-11-29 12:53:43 #AAOG not sure what all the excitement is about, this should clearly be in double figures. Its stupidly cheap and needs to rerate as soon as first oil is rns'ed. Aaog got battered for being diligent. Also good to see the Bod listened to shareholders and kicking sandabel to touch.
7790 2018-11-29 12:53:41 What a load of tosh we have our own industries here in Scotland the oil is ours the one that they lied through their teeth about and told us it was running out in 2014 .do you recall that and the lying vow.

7797 2018-11-29 12:53:11 Why were a bunch of RINOS toasting him at Rice in the first place? He said a lot of stupid things that night including taking credit for the oil boom during his regime. Of course the oil boom was despite his policies not because of them. He is the biggest pompous ass ever.
7798 2018-11-29 12:53:03 i'm pissed that it's not a BP representative called oil-inator that flings oil around and sticks seagulls heading through beer holders just for fun...
7799 2018-11-29 12:52:57 I doubt it would be that much. US only get 11% of its oil from Saudi Arabia. Most is from Canada, 40%. Only one reason why this country is sucking up to SA and it isn't oil.
7800 2018-11-29 12:52:43 Obama and sheep followers: Really?? If you believe this, our country is in deeper trouble than I originally thought. If Obama’s work resulted in increased oil production, then you’d have seen the results during his disservice as an American President.
7801 2018-11-29 12:52:31 Gee, when the price dropped under Obama Fox News said  POTUS doesn't effect oil prices. Has that changed?

7807 2018-11-29 12:51:57 Sandeep you are gullible to believe any ramper. Only RNS facts speak the value. You are probably too young to recollect the Falklands hype from ' the man in the cafe' or ' blue chips'. Hyped to staggering levels, millions of barrels oil and condensate discovered, then sank to 19p
7808 2018-11-29 12:51:55 Obama should take credit for this just like he’s taking credit for the USA currently being the top oil producer.

7817 2018-11-29 12:51:27 That is just idiotic. That is like saying "Trump can't take credit for growth in the economy because most of it happened in private companies." Obama restored the economy and increased demand kept the price of oil high enough to make fracking economically viable.
7818 2018-11-29 12:51:26 Global Oil Prices have fallen by 33% since September. Why aren’t prices at the pump not falling?

7854 2018-11-29 12:48:22 so sad that these young men lost their lives, because of the greed for oil.
7855 2018-11-29 12:48:10 The best solution is to stop giving tax breaks and subsidies to the oil cartels and let them compete fairly with renewables that’s increasingly and inevitably getting cheaper and more convenient than fossil fuels. Let nature take its course.
7856 2018-11-29 12:48:08 We should go back to Ford’s original engine that ran on alcohol. Rockefeller’s greed locked in oil derivatives to run cars. That was a huge mistake and by doing that, he is solely to blame for pollution/smog from cars...all over the world.
7857 2018-11-29 12:47:59 Obama now takes credit for massive oil production in U.S., all he did was get in the way, individual states approved fracking not feds.He created 1000’s of regs., to hinder and killed Keystone Pipeline. Liar and narcissist.

7861 2018-11-29 12:47:24 @DwightBallMHA you once said the first thing you look at in the morning is the price of oil, well currently it is trading at about $60 a barrel, so the question is what are you basing spending on is it the current price or your projected price of $74 a barrel ? #nlpoli

7889 2018-11-29 12:45:03 Although I agree with the sentiment, I find it amazing that palm oil is your primary concern and not agriculture. Far more of the amazon is lost due to making space for cattle and associated plantations (soy beans to feed them) 
Humans need to cut down on their meat obsession.

7891 2018-11-29 12:44:53 I have to laugh.
Your 'evidence' is an opinion piece in the NYT by an ex Politifact employee.
The author cited a number of hit pieces claiming oil companies knew about global warming.
But the documents indicate the oil companies were *actually* concerned with the politics.
7892 2018-11-29 12:44:47 @bbc5live @SkyNews Oil prices trading at $60 dollars. Why don't the fuel and energy suppliers in UK pass on the decrease to consumers? What goes up stays up in UK markets.
7893 2018-11-29 12:44:42 I like to get up early for the Business Report. Are these companies "pouring in" making gas or electric? Big Oil is going bye-bye before the planet burns up.

Talk about narcissistic.  Desperate for a legacy.

7904 2018-11-29 12:44:07 5. Of all oil and gas fields currently in the UK, 96% are sited in Scottish territorial waters. Only Norway in Europe has equivalent resources (that country on the North Sea with 5m population and no deficit..)
6. New oil field off Shetland has potential for 50 years of revenue.
7905 2018-11-29 12:44:05 Perhaps it wasn't @katthekat75 though, I know she used to bully @jthavest but heard she gave in and stopped all that.  It was the snake oil I ordered from AliBaba a few months back.
7906 2018-11-29 12:43:56 'Yemen’s economic infrastructure – farms, private businesses and factories, oil and gas facilities, water and electricity lines and food storage – have also been hit. And the coalition has targeted and destroyed schools and medical facilities too.'
7907 2018-11-29 12:43:49 Just had an idea !...involving.. heat, oil pastels (liquid form), glass, light(s) and a camcorder.
7908 2018-11-29 12:43:42 I suggest you don't try selling oil just yet
7909 2018-11-29 12:43:39 Yea it went up during your years but had nothing to do with you Liar in Chief. It was the western oil states. YOU stopped pipe line! You block Gulf Drilling, You took over National Parks where oil is. You multiplied regulations on energy! etc.etc,etc. Now you suffer from egomania
7910 2018-11-29 12:43:37 Q is Illuminati
Its all nonsense for public consumption
What they dont want you to pay attention to is that Nissan stocks fell- car plants everywhere closing...becos oil is running out. The Globalists power comes from controlling Power- energy thats the only resource of any value
7911 2018-11-29 12:43:29 @Tesco @tescoshelps One of my favourite products from your shop store is Tesco Fruit And Nut Granola. It was not long ago until I realised that this product contains PALM OIL! It made me to think if the oil is sustainably obtained or ... Can you please clarify me?

7914 2018-11-29 12:43:25 @BarackObama only got in the way! No Keystone pipeline, halted drilling in Gulf, regulation permits went from 70 to 700 pages. Oil production DID increase, because of state NOT Fed government decisions. Sit down BSO.@realDonaldTrump is the real leader for energy
7915 2018-11-29 12:43:20 @BarackObama oil production is your doing eh? So you’re #1 in destroying the plant then? Lol stfu

So no to #Cadbury, NO!

7931 2018-11-29 12:41:54 The Khashoggi affair & the Trump administration’s subsequent support of KSA through it has weakened Trump’s standing in Congress, compounding losses in the House of Representatives. We will see if Trump continues his support of KSA and what will happen when price of oil increase.

7940 2018-11-29 12:40:50 I'm not making excuses, but I think passengers were spooked by Primera so bookings fell just when oil was rising. Expanding too fast hasn't helped. If they have the cash to keep afloat then Iceland remains a perfect intercontinental hub for low-cost operations

7942 2018-11-29 12:40:40 It wasn’t as good as it looks.  I took some of the meat off & mixed it with the Greek salad. Which I forgot had olives on it. Idk what the dressing was but it was good. Normally, I only eat ceases, ranch or olive oil or blue cheese.
7943 2018-11-29 12:40:35 It’s just bullshit distraction based on 3 things I believe:
- Avoid Khashoggi topic
- worldwide oil price manipulation
- Truno’s personal financial reliance on Saudi’s

7946 2018-11-29 12:40:15 Some while ago I must have stepped in a pile of Trump. It smells awful!  First, I scrapped it off with a stick, but I could still smell it. So I washed my shoe with Mueller's Oil Soap. It still smells. Everyday I wake up to that smell. Should I write Mueller's or what?

7949 2018-11-29 12:40:08 This is a strange take. Easier to float when there’s little or no pressure than when there is, helps you adjust under less stressful conditions. Nigeria doesn’t have the capability to maintain a managed rate and that’s a major reason lack of productivity and low non oil exports.

7960 2018-11-29 12:39:08 @BarackObama still trying to claim credit for booming economy, and even our oil production, even though he did everything possible to reduce production of oil and gas in the U.S. through regulation and declaring area's "off limits."

7974 2018-11-29 12:37:39 Let’s not get in cahoots with Saudi to continue to drop oil prices! Let’s become more energy independent and allow supply and demand to dictate oil prices! drive down to the grocery store and see how much one barrel of fresh water is! Given the cost per gallon it’s more than oil!
7975 2018-11-29 12:37:26 Like father, like son. Flipping the bird from the elitist perch he grew up on, JT has no time for the hard working people of Alberta.  Ethical oil and farms are not sophisticated enough for him.
7976 2018-11-29 12:37:24 I guess when Hillary did nothing when the phone call came in from Benghazi asking for help which cost American lives...That was OK..

7977 2018-11-29 12:37:23 Maybe if the crude oil would be more-refined, people would want it more.

7985 2018-11-29 12:36:30 If President Trump is the worst President ever, why does Obama take credit for President Trump's strong economy, President Trump's record breaking unemployment, and President Trump's recent oil boom? 

Obama had eight years to do this kind of stuff for us but he didn't. Why?

8000 2018-11-29 12:35:20 Hello Karrie. Not all palm oil is bad! It can be grown sustainably, with many brands and supermarkets in the UK now only sourcing 100% certified sustainable palm oil. Our new standards go even further 1/2
8001 2018-11-29 12:35:16 I don't feel one bit sorry. It was clear from the start that Trump cared for one person only. Himself. He is a con man selling snake oil. Always has been, always will be.

8004 2018-11-29 12:35:05 The cut the oil market needs is not from #OPEC but rather from US Shale producers. If this happened you would see oil soar, but they are not that smart.

8013 2018-11-29 12:34:23 So if Obama in his own words is responsible for us being the top oil exporter, wouldn't that make the supposed increase in climate change his fault as well? Or does he only take credit for the positive things finally happening now.

8022 2018-11-29 12:33:53 He went from being extremely proud of the voluntary Paris Accord to boasting about increased oil production in one convoluted, extemporaneous thought. There had to be a part of his brain screaming, "Eject! Eject! Eject! Stay with Paris Accord! Climate Change!"
8023 2018-11-29 12:33:49 @MorningEdition When doing stories about the booming oil industry in South Dakota this week, I’m surprised there has been no mention of climate change.  IPCC report implies we have to hugely scale back oil use this decade. Would be a good connection to make for your listeners.

8028 2018-11-29 12:33:08 With each payment should be a free oil change
8029 2018-11-29 12:33:00 In addition, after the BP oil spill he said he was " looking for ass to kick"  and used that to further the Left's obsession with portraying oil and gas as bad and pushed wind farms and the 500 million debacle of Solyndra. Give me a damn break

8036 2018-11-29 12:32:27 Obama did everything he could to stop oil & gas production on federal lands. Most if not all of the increase was on private lands which he wanted to shut down but couldn’t.  Oil production increased despite him not because of him.

Gas prices skyrocketed, reaching nearly $4.00/gallon at the pump and  remaining above $3.00/gallon for 1,410 days.

8135 2018-11-29 12:24:40 Oil extraction is a long term project.  Exploration, planning extraction, permits, construction of extraction devices (further development of same), supply lines- all of this crosses presidencies- making production no ones achievement- or failure.

Obummer never helped the oil industry.
Every advancement in oil during his administration was on private land or caused by individual oil companies .
Once again he is lying.
8142 2018-11-29 12:24:20 Obama didn’t have a damn thing to do with any of it. The facts prove otherwise. The truth is he was doing his best to slow oil production. What a narcissistic fraud.
8143 2018-11-29 12:24:18 2 Years After Standing Rock Protests, North Dakota Oil Business Is Booming
8144 2018-11-29 12:24:18 @Obama lying again.  The oil production boom was done State by State.  Texas, OK & others did oil production on their own.  The Federal govt had nothing to do with it.  In fact, Obama tried to stop the states. So Obama taking credit for it is actually wrong.
8145 2018-11-29 12:24:08 No Joe, this is capitalism the dems abandoned the working class in favor of Wall Street in the 70s its all in listen liberal. There will never be a golden era of prosperity under capitalism for all. It’s a myth the GOP is pure snake oil but Democrats are guilty of BS.

8149 2018-11-29 12:23:56 How does Obama take credit
for helping out with the oil industry, when he wouldn't let
them drill in Alaska. He was
against the Keystone pipe line.
Stopped drilling in the Gulf for
months, not in favor of fracking
etc.
8150 2018-11-29 12:23:53 @BarackObama saw you on TV trying to take credit of us being the #1 oil producer which is ANOTHER LIE.  U did EVERYTHING to keep America down!  You’re nothing but a COMMON CRIMINAL who did NOTHING AS President other than SMOKE CRACK & SLEEP WITH MEN!! You’re a REAL POS!

8152 2018-11-29 12:23:46 Why does Obama try and take credit for everything good President Trump does. Now Obama is taking credit for being largest oil producer. Per Former Shell Oil President John Hofmeister Obama had nothing to do with increased energy production. It’s all President Trump.
8153 2018-11-29 12:23:45 @kilmeade Hi Brian you just had a guest on your show by the first name of John that spoke about what president Obama did not do to help oil and energy production during his presidency. What was your guest’s last name?
8154 2018-11-29 12:23:44 The Democrats have no shame! Now Obama is claiming credit for off shore drilling making America #1 oil producer in world. Yeah the same off shore drilling he outlawed! What a liar! No shame.

8168 2018-11-29 12:22:41 Obama is a liar and a joke. We suffered in oil & gas while he tried to push his clean energy. We laid-off over 200 from my company.
We are hiring daily under Trump. Thank God for Trump!

8183 2018-11-29 12:21:10 Obama had nothing to do with oil. Gov had no role. It was the states.  Numbers did increase but not from him. He's trying to reinvent his self. Lol lol.

8185 2018-11-29 12:20:57 I’d like you to start paying your taxes and stop using palm oil 
8186 2018-11-29 12:20:48 These politicians are not only bungling in privacy but also the oil pipelines, crime, the budget, illegal migrants and energy tax.  Let us remember these at election time.
8187 2018-11-29 12:20:45 I get your point but you have to read labels you'd think you didn't. I've recently almost bought olives packed in safflower oil and pork rinds fried in canola oil!!!

8193 2018-11-29 12:20:18 @BarackObama YOU have NOTHING to do with our increase in oil production. Those were STATE efforts and you did everything you could to stop it. Keystone pipeline ring any bells in that empty head of yours?
8194 2018-11-29 12:20:09 Typical Obama/Left take credit for something they had nothing to do with and point their finger at others for their messes. Obama did everything in his power to stop oil and coal production! The POS also tried to bring our country to it’s knees with regulations that made no sense
8195 2018-11-29 12:19:51 Obama, the liar.  Fed Gov had nothing to do with the oil production.  Individual States did.  You tried to undermine it.
8196 2018-11-29 12:19:44 I love how he’s saying that it’s proven something, seeing as it hasn’t concluded yet. Climate change denial, I can sadly see — it’s been politicized and corrupted by big oil and hung onto by continued influence bias.

I don't know what jobs weren't coming back. If it was inference to certain steel jobs,  they won't as technology has replaced them
8199 2018-11-29 12:19:41 I think a better way to protest is by building a pipeline that sends  Canadian oil from Alberta to Ontario instead of importing oil from the Saudi.

8209 2018-11-29 12:18:56    Satisfying: in low-calorie diets, the presence of olive oil is interesting because it relieves the feeling of hunger. In addition, its consumption has been associated with the production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that regulates moods. #AOVE #aceitedeoliva #EVOO #o

8255 2018-11-29 12:15:16 @KatRamsland Putin said the current oil price is “balanced and fair” and well above the level Russia needs to meet its budget forecasts. “If it’s required, we’re in touch with OPEC, we will continue this joint work,” he said.

8267 2018-11-29 12:14:11 Osama Obama is a jerk and a liar. Oil production in the US went up in spite of him. It went up mainly due to fracking in North Dakota; which he fought tooth and nail; but it was state and not federal and there was little he could do to stop it.
8268 2018-11-29 12:13:49 The Obama’s and the Clinton’s were so close to destroying this country. And now odumba is taking credit for the oil production. And the economy up swing. Only weak minded people believe that . Thank you Sir. I salute you Mr Trump.

8278 2018-11-29 12:12:58 Technology has moved on & we don’t need to use oil as fuel. A cleaner alternative is available. The corruption is within the industry that wants to continue global pollution only for selfish profit regardless of the consequences.

8297 2018-11-29 12:10:39 No like deregulating our corporations, listening restrictions on oil production, and many of the economic advantages that we are now reaping the benefits of.  Eliminating the individual mandate in healthcare.  These are just a few of the great things that are going on.
8298 2018-11-29 12:10:36 Actually, that has very little, if anything, to do with the rise in GDP. In fact, oil is why our GDP was falling so badly for so long. More people were investing in on-shore drilling in Texas than our off-shore oil.
8299 2018-11-29 12:10:35 Congressman are threatening the Saudi government. I urge the Saudis to start raising the price of oil today. For a Target of 7$ a gallon for gas. Then let's Q the congressman about their threats tied to the price of oil.

8313 2018-11-29 12:09:02 Be careful Mr. President with low oil prices. First, it will reduce Saudi income which in turn reduce arms purchases from USA. Second, low oil prices could close down many USA shale oil companies and in turn raises unemployment.

8324 2018-11-29 12:08:03 So JK says cut oil production by 10%. The CAOP. Says thank you for your opinion. But no. We will continue to produce at current levels. So JK says 10s of thousand of jobs are on chopping block. Fearmongering. Once again.

8384 2018-11-29 12:01:46 It’s been “peak oil” since the 1970s. 

Efficiency is the answer. The market is creating the supply for that demand. LEDs are the fraction of the price they were, & use very little electricity. It’s been so good in Ontario, that electricity use went down that Hydro raised prices.
8385 2018-11-29 12:01:39 How is that exciting? The world will NEVER be -100%- renewable.

8442 2018-11-29 11:56:40 Yeah, I'm sure stopping the Keystone pipeline, implementing fracking rules, and cutting loose an unfettered EPA were the reasons oil production is booming, thanks Obama  bonehead.

8445 2018-11-29 11:56:16 Je te parle de l'ensemble de la situation. Sous couvert de respect d'environnement, le gouvernement fait passer ce mouvement pour des personnes qui ne pensent qu'à leur voiture.

Alors que c'est pour contrer ce que fait le gouvernement depuis un moment

8463 2018-11-29 11:54:30 Hey @byronhamburgers! LOVED the Veggie Cheesemas in Farringdon last night, but I’d recommend peppermint oil to help with the mouse problem.
8464 2018-11-29 11:54:23 Still can’t believe Trump is cutting oil prices in this country it’s going to hurt our economy every thing he did to help out oilfields in this country he is messing it all up he’s killing our economy that’s the biggest reason we voted for Trump and the wall he’s losing on these

8468 2018-11-29 11:54:15 Absolutely. Brown sauce on sausages, red sauce on chips. Unless you're in Edinburgh when it's that by-product of the North Sea oil industry, chip-shop sauce, that is de rigueur. And brown on a Scotch pie at the football but beans and chips when served on a plate. #rules
8469 2018-11-29 11:54:14 I suspect he boo-word 'masculinity' is a distraction here. Trump is a sadsack poor little rich boy kind of coward who wouldn't even know how to change the oil in his car. But he exudes "machismo'. He likes to cause hurt, and to bully. And his wealth makes that easy...
8470 2018-11-29 11:54:12 Oil does not penetrate wood.
'Boiled' oil does.
8471 2018-11-29 11:54:03 It's OK, BBC, we know what you meant when you said "We love you, Scotland."
We're going to take our oil, renewables, fishing grounds, world class food & drink and play with countries that can behave like sensible grown ups.
So long & no thanks for all the pish.
8472 2018-11-29 11:53:56 RCP 4.5 is based on population and economic growth moderate, but slightly lower than under scenario RCP 2.6
Total energy consumption is slightly higher than RCP 2.6 while oil consumption is fairly constant through to 2100. Nuclear power and renewables play a greater role. 1/2

8486 2018-11-29 11:52:22 @BarackObama Your arrogance is unbelievable. After all of our money you wasted on green technology and constantly demonized the oil and gas industry you now want to take credit because it’s booming. You did everything you could to shut it down.
8487 2018-11-29 11:52:12 Oh my aching butt! He was the biggest obstacle to oil production and transportation. He thwarted and blocked the production of oil in the Dakotas and the pipeline to the Gulf for Global distribution and American profits. I can’t believe the Gall of this “Liar in Chief”!

8496 2018-11-29 11:51:00 TV ad for CBD oil!
8497 2018-11-29 11:50:54 It seems you have mere speculation. Also climate change warnings have been ignored by the gov since the 80s. And even if it is not real (evidence is overwhelming that it is real) it would be prudent to take care of the earth and to walk away from Saudi oil.
8498 2018-11-29 11:50:36 Save some of that oil for the rest of us

8510 2018-11-29 11:49:00 1/ Picking the right stock is only 1/2 the work. When the industry dynamics don't favour, even the strongest of companies may underperform.

Many investors realised this the hard way when rising oil prices played spoilsport with @IndiGo6E 's otherwise stellar prospects.

8512 2018-11-29 11:48:47  that's not what she meant. Some of them left to find either engine oil or another engine, and then the second group that left were part of the party who listened to the fishermen that warned them about the boat. Otherwise, the rest of the crew (if there was any) stayed.
8513 2018-11-29 11:48:41 Thank YOU President Trump!

8530 2018-11-29 11:47:02 The authorities concerned should conduct raids on daily basis for checking food items and special focus should be on factories of oil, ghee, chillies and spices, on chicken, meat, restaurants, bakeries and fast food centres.

It started with my nephew & I being chased by the main villain on an oil rig when everyone stops as 3 rigs in the ocean are swallowed by the sea / flames right before the one we were on gets destroyed in an earthquake and I woke up.
8549 2018-11-29 11:45:00 the same is true for olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The odds are very high you have never tasted the real stuff
8550 2018-11-29 11:44:46 Be careful with essential oils, but hospitals usually have an emergency bottle of peppermint oil around for such occasions. 

I have a vial of Black Cherry oil specifically meant for cpap machines. Use it on new tube nights.

8583 2018-11-29 11:40:39 With decreasing oil prices, Pakistan ought to benefit. Oil mkt companies should calculate inventories & reserves to benefit more from declining trend, particularly after Saudia has agreed to supply oil on deferred payments basis. Only variable in Saudi deal is prevailing rate.

Stop oil from crashing. It is fine at 65. To 75. A bbl. 
Many millions of Americans rely on the oil industry for a living. If you crash it to the 20's or less you will be putting millions of Americans out of work.

8608 2018-11-29 11:38:02 It does take a little time to filter through. However the bulk of what you pay goes direct to the treasury in fuel duty and VAT, so we never really see the full benefits. Sadly.

8719 2018-11-29 11:22:51 Well I guess there's a number of different causes which are pretty broad.  If it's stress, I can recommend an Epsom salt bath & regular exercise such as a half hour walk daily. Omega-3 fish oil, vitamin D can also help with stress.  Anyway, like I said I hope you're healthy soon.
8720 2018-11-29 11:22:49 Pro tip for those who, like me, take a daily fish oil supplement: do not place the soft gel in your shirt pocket, promptly forget about it, and then later wonder why you smell like, of all things, fish. One squished pill and I may never get the odor out of my shirt. Or my skin.

Adulteration is dietary products, if not stoped could put public health on risk:

In 1981, industrial-grade rapeseed oil that was sold as olive oil in Spain caused more than 20,000 illnesses and at least 300 deaths.

8977 2018-11-29 10:56:05 Unaccustomed as I am to speaking in the NRA's defense, it only seems fair to note that crude oil sold below $50 per barrel for most of last year. Thus, obviously the Russians had far less disposable income in 2017.

8990 2018-11-29 10:54:40 I'm English. But if the uk had used oil revenues in the way Norway did then the whole uk would be in a better place. Norway took a fairly small % of oil income every year for a national saving account. This has given Norway a strong financial position

9157 2018-11-29 10:31:50 Back in 2012-13 there were at least 2 serous threats to Kremlin. They were (1) low approval ratings signalling a possibility of mass anti-authorities protests, and (2) a comotized economy with Dutch deasise that required domestic adjustment in face of coming oil price weakness

9196 2018-11-29 10:27:02 That reduced methane production will be compensated by humans producing more methane.

Besides that, all the products made with animal products, leather, felt, etc. will need to be made of other materials, like oil, cotton, etc. Which means more fossil sources. Small net result.

9206 2018-11-29 10:25:52 Seems most liberals didn't care what obama did and will support his lies about the economy and oil production.  As president he was worse then carter and did nothing to help this country move forward.

9208 2018-11-29 10:25:48 This is a shameful day in Australia. We should be phasing out coal, oil and gas and going into renewables and nuclear.
9209 2018-11-29 10:25:40 was considered uppity. The British owned the oil industry in Iran and their ownership was threatened. They called in the Americans; between them they overthrew the only democratically elected govt in Iran's history, physically took back the oil production - + installed the Shah.
9210 2018-11-29 10:25:35 And when the wind doesn’t blow and it’s cloudy then what?

Btw oil consumption is expected to go up and oil will never go away. Only an idiot would want to completely divest.
9211 2018-11-29 10:25:27 Because “governments” are really just public institutions controlled by individuals in geopolitical syndicates. The real playing field is comprised of alliances between American oil and arms manufacturers, British aristocracy and Russian oligarchs vs European Union.
9212 2018-11-29 10:25:22 This Obama is beyond the limits of HYPOCRISY.  Claiming Record Oil Production something of his own and knowing  he fought it hardly during eight years is lack of integrity and  DECENCY. His Legacy of HORROR will stay forever.
9213 2018-11-29 10:24:59 How much oil was around before the middle east discovered oil? If you look at history, the Arab states were far more isolated at the time and "impossible" to export. This time it's different?
9214 2018-11-29 10:24:49 I just spent about 3 hours taking off my eyelash extensions and lemme just say, 1. I might wake up blind with all this coconut oil in my eyes, and 2. IDGAF HOW PRETTY THEY LOOK, NEVER AGAIN, MY NATURAL LASHES ARE ENOUGH.

9279 2018-11-29 10:16:03 Read a book recently called Shadow Wars, open my eyes big time. Syria was being bombed by the Yanks and Brits in the 50's coz of their close ties with Russia and coz they needed Syria for oil and pipe lines. 60 years on there still trying

9293 2018-11-29 10:14:08 Russia sits on untapped oil reserves. The GOP isn’t so much nationalist and isolationist as it plays itself to be. They are in fact positioning themselves with Russia for white world dominance. That is the pathway they see to maintaining the 1% here too. Fuck everyone else.
9294 2018-11-29 10:13:52 Just learned that, like Italy's butter olive oil line, the Baja strip has a flour tortilla in the north, corn tortilla in the south cuisine.
9295 2018-11-29 10:13:50 Another reason why we must stop Brexit. Whilst we remain in the EU we can have clear labelling regulations. The ERG group are calling for deregulation which means none of us will be able to ID Palm oil GMO & other horrors.Stay safe & demand a PeoplesVote!

9298 2018-11-29 10:13:36 Was reading that 214 oil fields are to be decommissioned by 2025

How much of the total is this? 

Half?
9299 2018-11-29 10:13:26 No-one ever said it did (except maybe the Indonesian government). It is for the orangutans that groups like Orangutan Land Trust, Sumatran Orangutan Society, HUTAN, Orangutan Republik, Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation and more call for deforestation-free palm oil.

9308 2018-11-29 10:12:40 Norway extracts twice as much oil at half the price for the simple fact they haven't emptied the "easy to get to oil", the oil price is expected to fall again to below $50 and not expected to rise above $70, unfortunately the oil industry in Scotland isn't a money spinner now.

9328 2018-11-29 10:09:59 Totally agree. I was going to support you as I deeply care about deforestation due to the catastrophic palm oil issue. Seriously your company appears to care more about profits than workers rights & environmental protection which we lose with Brexit. Hypocrites .

9440 2018-11-29 09:56:07 Thank you for the example Earl. However, I am not sure how that is proof of God. For example, if the output from the Sun was only 100 times the energy of our daily crude oil consumption would that lower your confidence? Would you then be less sure?

9533 2018-11-29 09:44:49 So an economy collapsed due to a sharp decline in oil prices, it's understandable especially if the economy is mainly driven by one type of resource. But from what I read Venz has had rampant gov from the times of the Perez's, why didn't sanctions happen then?

9536 2018-11-29 09:44:46 The irony of the continuous flow of oil from the test well!! at all layers is that any oil professional will tell you rates are exceptional. Production pipe will increase the flow as it is narrower and can withstand more pressure which increases flow dramatically.

9842 2018-11-29 09:07:12 Cool, caloric density is in fact part of food reward since it closely trails the fat component. You can't raise density without inserting fat. That's why we put butter on toasts, cheese over burgers and put olive oil over salad and soup.

9853 2018-11-29 09:05:54 Trump and crude oil

So, President Trump is on the record for saying:

- oil price is high, must go lower (5 days ago)

- oil price is low, pull troops out of middle East ( 2 days ago).

So, he asserted that price is both high and low.

Just saying.

9865 2018-11-29 09:04:17 I hope that the OPEC, Saudi Arabia and Russia should cut the production of crude oil as there is oversupply and the demand is less. Also the cost of oil is now at a decent price.
9866 2018-11-29 09:04:05 It's an oil! You'll have to make it yourself! 
Aloe Vera gel: 100 ml

Mix these oils together and keep it refrigerated. And apply it to the scalp for not more than three hours. Use it on daily basis!

9914 2018-11-29 08:57:35 In recent years, investors pushed major oil firms to return a lot of cash. Based on projected increased demand for the coming decade, the underinvestment into oil production will lead to a shortage in supply.

9947 2018-11-29 08:51:06 I'm asking about the nationalisation of the petroleum industry under Perez. Why didn't it lead to government failure. Not prior to that when the oil sector was mainly controlled by American oil companies
9948 2018-11-29 08:51:05 Most countries around the world are in their own trading blocs similar to EU - in Asia, Caribbean, america, Pacific. We are just fixated on Europe because it’s where we are.

9986 2018-11-29 08:45:05 If their solar & EV scenarios were spot on in NPS, the answer is the same. Even in SDS there is place for more oil. Even scenarios assessed by the IPCC show space for more oil. Only the most aggressive of aggressive 1.5°C scenarios question the space for oil investment.
