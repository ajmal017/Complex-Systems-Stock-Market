10 2018-02-12 23:12:49 Wow, so this is incredibly racist - reducing black people to commodities. You clearly represent white people who still view black people for the purposes of exploitation and slavery. I'm not sure why people haven't yet reported you. No worries, I've done that for them :)

32 2018-02-12 22:11:34 Quanto a crescimento muito menos do que devia pois estavamos no melhor da piramide estária e commodities no maior preço da história. E a queda no PIB em 2015 e 2016 foi herança do deficit fiscal de gastança descontrolada. Com a saída dela melhorou muito!
33 2018-02-12 22:03:08 Me parece que a empresa focou o crescimento recente em commodities. Aí o ROIC é menor.
34 2018-02-12 22:00:59 Cryptocurrencies are not insured, not controlled by a central bank or other governmental authority, are subject to very little if any regulation, and cannot be easily exchanged for other commodities.

38 2018-02-12 21:47:16 Reading the op-ed, it seems that the industry views media personalities as being commodities rather than an integral part of a team. They might as well be racehorses owned by a stable. My father's employees were loyal because he invested in them. No  non-compete contract needed.

60 2018-02-12 19:54:41 Food prices like other commodities depend on supply and demand. And, clearly you don't understand that our produce, not just here in Calif but all over the US is picked for the most part by migrate workers. No pickers, no product.Prices increase on remaining stock.Simple enough?
61 2018-02-12 19:33:23 I'm all for infrastructure spending as long as they don't privatize these commodities to Wall St like reports have been saying. Be skeptical.
62 2018-02-12 19:32:42 Of the various swing positions we have on in our discretionary account, we are specific to our trading plan. Some commodities, short rates, a tail in an ultrashort & only a couple of stocks that are not commodity related. I'm OK not loading up into resistance

73 2018-02-12 18:39:21 Guaranteed to raise costs and reduce health, since many people who get SNAP have health problems that standard USDA commodities will make worse.
74 2018-02-12 18:36:39 I however think it's a PR mishap for all this to take place in the media. This is part of supply chain and can happen without a press release. NMS should conduct this as part of it's routine reverse logistics for commodities. We can't allow expired medicines to sit in facilities
75 2018-02-12 18:34:22 how do you let the farmers decide their own price, when govt controls the export/import policies of agri commodities which most of the time work against the farmer and benefits the traders? Add to that govt wants to keep the CPI low and manipulates the system accordingly..

80 2018-02-12 18:16:42 Lorries are not bought to smuggle or transport banned and illegal commodities.

There are over a million lorries in Kenya transporting goods daily and making a honest living. 

When you transport illegal /banned goods then you face the consequences.

Sad but true.

No good. It's worse than the book. It's better than the book. Losing female screenwriters/directors did hurt it, imo. Its strongest fetishism, by far, is for commodities. 
Somehow, I feel empty.
84 2018-02-12 18:10:06 This is pretty much a back to the future approach isn't it?  People who used to get food assistance got surplus government commodities. We moved away from that. This would send us back to the approach of the 50's.
85 2018-02-12 18:01:35 NASAA points out that unlike FIAT or traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies have no physical form and typically are not backed by tangible assets (though I note that this is a void that is quickly being addressed by new tokens backed by physical assets and commodities).

89 2018-02-12 17:51:47 @DarinNewsom . A question. Under what circumstances do you see current equity volatility (VIX) migrating into commodities and soft commodities? Unlikely? Or probable?
90 2018-02-12 17:44:21 Rent shop in kiambu, taxes za local and national government, transport and the risk you assume since they are all perishable and add your profit margin. ... even if they bring the commodities here themselves, they will incur almost the same costs.
91 2018-02-12 17:42:46 #OBAMA's #FED may have so disoriented the credit markets they may NOT be able to transition back to a REAL "Market" (meaning they actually function without govt MANIPULATION)=we could be looking at equity and commodities markets that potentially just collapse due to dependencies
92 2018-02-12 17:41:07 What's your point here?

Have you seen the prices of vegetables in Lodwar. 
Same disparity. 

Who sets the prices? The sellers condemn themselves to this fate. Alternatively, they can bring up the commodities in Nairobi or Kiambu and sell them at the high prices they want. Yawa!
93 2018-02-12 17:39:26 And excuse me if my request for clarification is simplistic. I just really want to know if we are most worried about women's individual expression in porn or if society has made an industry that cares more about women's bodies being commodities versus vessels of free will.
94 2018-02-12 17:34:35 The latter have already tacitly ceded their ultimate value to be economic, according to their utility. Belief, identity become merely types of commodities. We are free to believe anything; our homogeneity lies in the common puerility of those beliefs.
95 2018-02-12 17:31:48 I know that’s it’s done before the SB but hence why this doesn’t make sense. So rams didn’t go effing 7-9 again this season.

101 2018-02-12 17:16:52 Ideology: at the level of belief, capitalist ideas (commodities are animate; capital's quasi-natural status) are repudiated but it is precisely the ironic distance from such notions that allows us to act AS IF they are true. Disavowing the beliefs allows us to perform the actions
102 2018-02-12 17:16:06 That you don't profit from your dairy cows otherwise they would be commodities, which you say they are not despite the fact you argue you don't rape them which would only be a term used for a "woman", making them less than a "woman" and therefore a commodity.
Anything else?
103 2018-02-12 17:07:44 To make use of and derive benefit from the resource. You use cows as a resource. They are commodities. It can't get any simpler

106 2018-02-12 17:00:25 Honorable CM Sahib, the performance of food control authority in KP has become worsed and failed to control the prices. Wholesalers and retailers are selling their commodities on their own favourite prices. This is injustice and your kind attention is needed to Control prices.
107 2018-02-12 16:55:36 And we are already seeing these companies profiteering off the back of vulnerable service users using them as commodities for financial gain another word for it people trafficking
108 2018-02-12 16:47:30 Been thinking if @joepine and Gilmore's Progression of Economic Value represents five elements of value; i.e. commodities = economic; goods = functionality; service = feeling; experience = expression; transformation = outcome?
109 2018-02-12 16:44:19 I said if you weren't exploiting them you wouldn't have that problem. Is that all I need to know? I know you use them as commodities and they go to slaughter, or do you own the largest ever cow sanctuary? #februdairy

115 2018-02-12 16:26:15 @LBC @IainDale Iain, ask your guest about the reality of money; is it a real thing?  I hold that there are only commodities and services, and that to believe in the existence of money is a manifest example of self-deception.
116 2018-02-12 16:23:10 The fact that cows are used as commodities and slaughtered is all we need to know. What is it you think we need to know and which bits are lies?

119 2018-02-12 16:19:39 Pero termina hablando de un mercado de bebés, los cuales no tienen self-ownership, y termina enrredándose él solo. Por eso no me convence. Si hay mercado (que justifica con "ya existe"), los bebés pueden pasar a ser - y si hay pragmatismo, ya lo son - commodities.

143 2018-02-12 14:56:26 Understood. the question is "what is causing the selloff", and I do not believe any macro issues are the case because the *normal* correlations between bonds/equities/commodities/gold are not behaving. This leads me to believe selloff is related to a short-term mechanical issue.
144 2018-02-12 14:55:12 Price drop over multiple years has been shown repeatedly as a reasonable proxy for value in assets where value is not easily defined.  See for example currencies and commodities in "Value and Momentum Everywhere" by @CliffordAsness .

233 2018-02-12 06:03:00 Dear Sir I am a south African exporter and I have all the documents to register to supply the PSF from my Libyan partner Dr Badjadi, we have producers of all the products you mentioned. One producer can only register for 2 commodities,regards Kevin
234 2018-02-12 05:52:49 all commodities need a common commodity to relate each other with.

why are there commodities?

well....
235 2018-02-12 05:50:51 Which is actually a phenomenal achievement as the government has guided Australia through the transition away from being a commodities boom economy (what Wayne relied on as Treasurer) to a more broad based economy. All the while dealing with Wayne’s legacy of structural debt.

237 2018-02-12 05:13:36 afects commodities prices because they are mostly traded in dollars correct?
238 2018-02-12 05:05:44 Or foreign companies must be reduced and domestic companies developed so they make up a majority because right now only foreign companies benefit from SA commodities.
239 2018-02-12 05:05:15 That's what capitalism is about. As @profdavidharvey notes capitalists care only about surplus value realised as profit, they are in different to the commodities they produce. If there is a market for poison gas there will produce it.
240 2018-02-12 05:02:25 In a non-corrupt or fairly low corruption rate government, profits from nationalized commodities ensure the capability of free education, healthcare, improved infrastructure, more government employment, more subsidies, adequate grants and more tenders for local companies...
241 2018-02-12 05:00:01 Commodities: Copper +1.79%, Canola +1.77%
242 2018-02-12 04:53:10 No they don't, because SA doesn't own those commodities, politics affect The Rand the most. The Swiss Franc is mostly affected by gold, because it's mined here and stored there, and the Yen somewhat.
243 2018-02-12 04:42:34 The second attempt was to introduce a wide national system of rationally established prices of all commodities, for which the real cost of production and moderate trade profits had to be taken into account.

245 2018-02-12 04:20:21 There's nothing wrong with buying cyclical or commodities. Just don't start treating them as long-term holds. Sold one of the net-nets I had bought in June-July 2017 after 140% profit.
246 2018-02-12 04:18:15 While Germany freed itself from subjection to France and England, manufactured her own cotton cloth, constructed her own machines — in fact, manufactured all commodities — the main industries took also root in Russia, where the development of manufacture is the more surprising as

250 2018-02-12 03:29:16 #NatGas - In summary, may be some more downside but upside move like this past January is VERY possible. See pinned tweet but saw $UGAZ go from $50 to $100 in a 5 week period. Could even go higher this time with $NG_F going for 3.90 area

252 2018-02-12 03:25:54 Let the commodities bull cycle begin.
253 2018-02-12 03:16:13 “When we fail to name and celebrate the ‘being’ in ‘human being,’ we are more likely to treat each other like objects, commodities, or machines. In an era of non-stop violence to the human self, we must lift up the fact that everyone has an inviolable, sacred core.”
254 2018-02-12 03:14:46 I think he might think it means that a spike equates to pnd in the commodities world.  the futures market is confusing even though it's based on what the market does naturally, i.e., think forward...
255 2018-02-12 03:13:32 Inflation will put them to obscure situation since there will be no additional take home from Tax Cuts but additional burden for them as the result of TRAIN effect on prices of services and commodities. The Upper Class enjoys additional perks while working class remains in mud.
256 2018-02-12 03:02:43 Fears about securely buying domains with Bitcoins are a red herring. It’s easy to trade Bitcoins for other non-reputable commodities.

260 2018-02-12 02:29:04 From Daily: “my trading plan remains the same-lighten up on equities, watch the US dollar and interest rates. Plus, buy commodities once the dollar breaks back down under 23.50.” Thus far, dollar under pressure in the overseas Mkt
261 2018-02-12 02:15:00 Value is subjective - see the subjective theory of value. By your argument, it is impossible to invest in equities, or fixed-income, or commodities. 

If someone allocates their capital to X with the expectation of future profit, they are an investor.
262 2018-02-12 02:13:26 The federal reserve is very involved in ensuring the conditions are right for the US economy to grow. They do so using their discount window: manipulating short term rates. Affects the dollar, which affects the price of commodities.
263 2018-02-12 02:12:42 You should join us there. We talk about many of those former positions often. Commodities should do well as the Fed sees inflation rising.
264 2018-02-12 02:10:08 When all four markets line up, the trends are explosive. But sometimes there are years when the four markets are not in alignment. 1970s for example: commodities were high priced, rates were high.
265 2018-02-12 02:07:49 Since you asked , :) I watch four main markers: bond yields, commodities, currency, & equity markets. Equity markets tend to do best when inflation is low, which means, commodities are trading at lows, USD is strong, and yields are low.

269 2018-02-12 01:59:20 Apenas finalizando, Brasil virou dependente da exportação de commodities devido a uma gestão pública burra, incompetente e corrupta. Sem investimento em ciência e tecnologia, só populismo. Mas as commodities são comercializadas a preços de mercado, e não "tiradas".

271 2018-02-12 01:52:17 No, Im vegan I dont want harm to sentient nonhuman animals or sentient human animals. 
Have you not noticed I try to stay objective not subjective? I want the abuse of sentient nonhuman animals as commodities, for profit, to disappear yes. In the big picture, that includes humans
272 2018-02-12 01:49:22 Hi Sean. I am still holding onto legacy UWR stocks from 2013-2014. How do you see commodities performing in this volatile market
273 2018-02-12 01:40:44 You just dont get it? The $ is a reserve currency many foreign countries use for trade and sell commodities priced in the $ they want paying in $ not £. As the $ has been falling the supplier wants more $ to maintain their price hence inflation. £ been falling since 1945 not 2017

279 2018-02-12 01:20:26 Uma coisa não tem nada a ver com a outra. O fato de o Brasil ser exportador de commodities e importador de manufaturados não tem nada a ver com "entreguismo" de recursos naturais. "Eles" não tiram nada, o Brasil vende commodities a preço de mercado internacional.
280 2018-02-12 01:08:27 Money coming out of $XIV into commodities
281 2018-02-12 01:03:12 A ideia é priorizar um efeito multiplicador maior. Estocagem de commodities é um ponto discutível mas transporte de celebridade não. O contraponto é a indústria aeronáutica.

Acho saudável a discussão sobre beneficiários de subsídios. Só espero que nenhum defenda Estado mínimo.
282 2018-02-12 00:55:14 I don't Know guys 4 trillion dollars disappeared on that market dip, didn't go into commodities or securities or gold and that's also when Bitcoin dipped, just saying 500 billion market cap on crypto can be brought down with some of that 4 trillion to then buy the crypto dip

285 2018-02-12 00:42:14 Well the BoE have a remit to keep inflation below a certain level (2%) so they will be forced to raise rates unless the policy changes. You dont seem to have clue regarding inflation as major commodities and much trade priced in $ not £ so its value of former will drive inflation
286 2018-02-12 00:35:50 Of course, all that does depend on technology. If James Howard Kunstler's predictions come to pass, all that shall pass away, and the rest of us will be dealing in land, commodities and gold.

288 2018-02-12 00:20:44 & that will continue. White men dominate the media & they aren't going to criticize their fellow white male executives. Politicians are concerned with both groups making more & more money. People of color, & women, are seen as commodities whose purpose is to enhance the product.
289 2018-02-12 00:19:40 I think it plays into the hands of the idea that education/staff are merely commodities and the strike is an inconvenience rather than sending the message that the real inconvenience is the pensions being cut, thats where the pressure should be
290 2018-02-12 00:18:57 Pode expandir isso para todo o mundo das produtoras de commodities, na maioria. Fibria, Vale, várias baixaram seu custo caixa. Crises criam oportunidades de limpar a bagunça, ineficiências.
