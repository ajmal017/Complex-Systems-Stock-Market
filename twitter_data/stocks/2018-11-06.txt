67 2018-11-06 23:22:23 A “booming stock market” means nothing to the average American. The wealthy own those stocks & get that wealth. It’s also an indicator of another economic crash on the horizon. Low unemployment is meaningless when the jobs don’t pay,are insecure, have no rights/benefits.

71 2018-11-06 23:20:55 Solid as a rock. My other stocks opened lower or look stagnant this morning. $IME is just about done with the 3's imo. FA alone puts this stock at fair value well above 4c imo. $30m MC with $5m cash and $4.5m yearly contracted revenues. And growing!

73 2018-11-06 23:20:30 US stocks have ticked higher in thin trading, supported by strong earnings and a rebound in technology stocks from a two-day selloff, while investors brace for the outcome of US midterm elections.

129 2018-11-06 22:48:17 Tax loss selling season is here. Look for great companies that have been unfairly sold down and institutions may be selling for a tax loss. 
One idea is Legend Power (LPS-TSXV). Call or email me. It’s time to discuss this one. $LPS.CA #taxloss #trading #stocks #investingidea
130 2018-11-06 22:47:35 If this is the case, I'm worried that the ARU/Wallabies/Cheika etc a) haven't done a position depth chart of Aus rugby stocks AND b) haven't worked with the 5 teams to work towards fixing weak positions (eg flyhalf). Did cheika just nix this a couple of weeks ago?
131 2018-11-06 22:46:53 $SPY Since last Tuesday, people daily going out of their way to convince me, subscribers and my followers to not be long in stocks. Stop :)
132 2018-11-06 22:46:22 marijuana stocks deleted their tweet this afternoon where this morning They declared cxxi a dumpster fire and used the words “falling knife” “liquidity trap” and “no technical reason” to buy cxxi. Talk about bad timing, lol.
133 2018-11-06 22:46:08 Fark -28%!
Levered MOMO is almost funny.  Lets buy the highest beta stocks and then lever then and not have a mechanism to go to cash rapidly.

138 2018-11-06 22:43:57 The "division" is from liberals eating up fake news propaganda non-stop. Jobs UP. Unemployment DOWN. Unemployment of latino & African Americans LOWEST EVER.

140 2018-11-06 22:43:11 After the poor/disappointing data from $AVEO & $ONCS. This was my first catalyst plays ever and it turned out horrible. Culminating with a general terrible day, it actually got to me today. I know this is the same for you guys and I’ve talked positive about these two stocks (2/X)
141 2018-11-06 22:42:54 there are no excuses for not voting today - a quick google search will tell you wolf wants bans on assault rifles/bump stocks and wagner does not - PITTSBURGH if you were upset by what happened last weekend - GET TO THE POLLS BY 8

145 2018-11-06 22:40:14 But bump stocks and shoelaces to tie the trigger down! We must ban everything! If you have two hands you can throw two ninja throwing stars at the same time! That's a weapon of mass destruction! Unacceptable! You must obey, Groucho Marx! I mean, Karl.  
146 2018-11-06 22:39:17 $SPY Trump’s redneck racist base got no benefit from stock bubble because they don’t own stocks and their wages didn’t go up either.
147 2018-11-06 22:38:49 And that one is a yes, and a yes. First stocks and options and later , futures ... Everytime size up or change it seems
148 2018-11-06 22:38:47 U.S stocks rose head of #MidtermsElections2018 that could change control of Congress
149 2018-11-06 22:37:17 Is burning an effigy of Boris Johnson and Theresa May a “hate filled offence”? If so then most of Lewes need to be arrested and dealt with publicly. Would the stocks suffice? Or perhaps a gulag as proscribed by the Bolsheviks for  not following the party line or being Christian.
150 2018-11-06 22:36:22 Ha! Stats can show anything U want them 2, incl. a bunch of hedge-fund billionaires making stocks rise, while #WeThePeople , America's formerly great Middle Class, were strangled by those corp.-types like Obama's JOBS CZAR, Imelt, exporting our factory jobs to freakin' CHINA!
151 2018-11-06 22:34:44 HAHAHAHAHAHAHWHA. Opo mam madami po akong stocks dito
152 2018-11-06 22:33:44 I’ve seen it. There’s many dems that own guns and just want to stop the assault guns and bump stocks. Do you have kids?

158 2018-11-06 22:31:57 If the stock market was less populated as you imply (only speculators and less investors), stocks would have been cheaper and equities returns should have been even greater.

167 2018-11-06 22:25:42 Oil stocks will crash in this weekend. Not exactly.　　石油株は今週末に暴落するだろう。いや、そうでもないよ。
168 2018-11-06 22:25:35 Stocks gain.....how the hell is that caution?
169 2018-11-06 22:25:06 So myopic. Excess reserves peaked at $2.7T while the Fed's BS grew by $3.6T at its peak. Not incl what BOJ, ECB, BOE & SNB did (that owns about $100b of US stocks w/ printed $) is not a full analysis. Every single 10%+ correction since '10 was around the end of QE & rate hike.
170 2018-11-06 22:24:41 So i recently started to invest in stocks and so far ive made $67 in like 2 months, shits kinda difficult to understand because there's so much you gotta know but so far it's turning out good
171 2018-11-06 22:24:07 No matter what you think of Trump, his reign as president has been great for stocks
172 2018-11-06 22:23:38 Cryptocurrencies, bonds, stocks, commodities etc..
All markets are manipulated. End of the story

174 2018-11-06 22:21:34 There are "Few Sustained Market implications" anyway! It's all artificially propped up as it is! So don't blame Democracts when your Fiat-Inflated-Stocks go bust! Wall Street loves an inflated MONEY ORGY, and especially if they can blame someone else for their own excesses!
175 2018-11-06 22:20:21 MY FATHER WHO AT IN HEAVEN SEND DOWN THE HEAVENLY SPIRITS FILLED IN HOLY GHOST BLOOD HAVE A MAP VIEW OVER ME BUT ABOVE ALL OVER MY AMAISING FAMILY! NAYE GUYS U NEED TO ALL PULL U'ALL STOCKS UP.
176 2018-11-06 22:19:45 One of the best “gorilla” tactics I heard recently was grafting fruit trees onto ornamental stocks! Very sneaky!
177 2018-11-06 22:19:07 Stories of brokers collecting interest on hard to borrow stocks without actually locating the shares.
178 2018-11-06 22:17:54 Why is he selling everything ;-)  - My prediction if that happens - it wont fall until next year permanently for a bit - may see an initial emotional drop that will recover soon there after until the real fall next year - DIP BUYS!  Also - will be looking  hard at Cannabis stocks
179 2018-11-06 22:17:42 The stock has run up in line with all Telecom Cable Stocks. However, they are not able to generate sufficient cash from their core activity due to abnormal delays in sales realisation, they constantly need to bring in more money even to run the operations.

187 2018-11-06 22:15:21 Remember you said this when TRUMP'S ECONOMY CRASHES!

Borrow & Spend Trillion-Dollar Deficits, Artificially Inflated Stocks, Low Wages for Consumers, Mounting Credit  Card Debt & Rising Prices on EVERYTHING, will certainly lead to another Recession, if not Depression, TRUMP OWNS!
188 2018-11-06 22:15:10 Buy stocks in case the Republicans win, the stock market will skyrocket.
189 2018-11-06 22:14:47 My quest for @milkmakeup foundation continues apparently because nowhere around here stocks it!!
190 2018-11-06 22:14:29 Completely disagree! With due respect to the success & fortune you have achieved in stocks, I feel nothing can be compared to God in whatever aspect. I would have been really thanking God for His Blessings & Grace, if I had achieved similar success & fortune . No hard feelings.

192 2018-11-06 22:12:38 @CNBCFastMoney i really wish you guys wd stick to stocks! There won’t even be any blue anything- if the dems win the house it means nothing. Trump will still be trump!
193 2018-11-06 22:12:27 does longing weed stocks before the election count as an “adjustment”
194 2018-11-06 22:12:06 That can happen with stocks, especially if Guidance is weak, or they say something dumb on the call
195 2018-11-06 22:12:02 That's what land, stocks and savings are for.
And good luck having a robot fix a real car. A Tesla sure, but a '71 Challenger... not so much.

197 2018-11-06 22:11:12 Broken records of lies, unmerited boasts, riding on Obama's policies that got us out of the worst recession, caused by Bush's. He more than doubled our National Debt into the TRILLIONS! Tarrifs backfiring,  banks increased interest rates, stocks dropping, end of American dreams.
198 2018-11-06 22:10:44 In medical grade pot? I’m just skeptic because science is too strong rn to let that happen, especially when millions of dollars in stocks is going into it
199 2018-11-06 22:09:36 Key words:  investor class / those with stocks / corporate execs
I think we all know the percentage of our fellow citizens who’d be described that way.
200 2018-11-06 22:08:53 Final Smash Meter should definitely be on for competitive play in Ultimate I know Final Smash’s are complete BS and unbalanced but this can be mitigated by changing the ruleset IE adding more stocks, banning certain Final Smash’s, or my personal choice turning on items as well!
201 2018-11-06 22:08:48 Lol, Obama picked it out of the sewer and had it going up. If it’s continuing then wonderful. The fact is that most Americans don’t own stocks but they do buy houses and cars. The inc interest rates have hurt those things. @realDonaldTrump @CNN
202 2018-11-06 22:08:35 It’s just like the stock market. How many of the middle class and those at poverty level invest in stocks!!!
203 2018-11-06 22:08:03 So I got my knowledge up about stocks and investing in companies. And I bout a 10$ stock from AT&T and now I have 15.11$ . Shit really cool

217 2018-11-06 21:59:56 Your 401k is not a sign of a strong economy. When interest rates go down, people invest more. When investment regulations are stripped, people invest more and at more risk. Right now the stock prices are up down up down. Interest rates are up..stocks down
218 2018-11-06 21:59:16 Haha, for sure, the exchange loves to keep stocks halted for days.
219 2018-11-06 21:59:14 @CNBCClosingBell  Sara got in another snotty cheap shot telling the MAGA portfolio manager that not all stocks have done well under Trump.  This girl makes so many clueless comments. Only a few more weeks & Kelly will thankfully be back.

221 2018-11-06 21:58:34 US stocks ticked higher in thin trading, supported by strong earnings & a rebound in tech stocks from a 2 day selloff, while investors brace for the outcome of US midterm elections. Ahead of the local open SPI futures are 10 points higher at 5,860. #ausshares #stockmarket
222 2018-11-06 21:58:32 If all of maple bought an album from u, is that not black spending power? If they all put their money at key bank in these various stocks and bonds that’s power. Our economy is based of consumer spending. It’s power
223 2018-11-06 21:58:25 Hi there, thanks for the question. We are actively looking into the matter but our hunch is that it is likely related to the FSE policies around cannabis stocks. We'll follow up as soon as the company receives an official answer from the FSE. Thanks.

235 2018-11-06 21:50:57 @BrainandMoney Alcoa just 3% away from 52wk low and all other copper stocks already at 52wk lows. No way Hindalco should be trading at 240+. Expect a vertical fall up to 215-200 very soon. Watch VEDL fall to sub 200 as well
236 2018-11-06 21:49:49 Good trade!  Glad to see it work, and I’ve been very happy with the px action in ED since the stocks stopped getting slaughtered
237 2018-11-06 21:47:52 I just want to make a shout-out to @WCXofficial. Deposited some btc, did a couple of trades, withdrew BTC today (to buy a shitcoin and not a lot of time for stocks now).
You have OCO orders, you can split positions in multiple sub orders, no fees for trading nor witdrawal/deposit
238 2018-11-06 21:46:58 I only trade indexes, but the system I use can absolutely be used on all stocks.

241 2018-11-06 21:45:01 #US stocks rose on Tuesday, as strong earnings and easing of trade tensions lifted materials and industrial sectors, but trading volumes were light as uncertainty about the outcome of #US midterm elections kept investors on the sidelines.

242 2018-11-06 21:44:21 Stocks might not be headed for fall correction, another technician says.
Stocks might go up, stocks might go down.
243 2018-11-06 21:43:48 And I would add, an even bigger threat would be FANB opening stocks and supporting non-state armed actors. Largest stock of MANPADs and RPGs in Latinamerica are in Venezuela +huge stocks of light weapons and ammo. Small % alone could be highly destabilizing.

257 2018-11-06 21:40:04 Stephanie it is not surprising the wealthy only think that stocks and tax cuts are the most important thing when comes to their vote but fail to realize stocks and tax cuts won't matter too much if the economy tanks because consumers can't afford to purchase goods.

In that case then yeah, I’d go with A3U. Boris stocks pretty much all the main 3P stuff and tends to get a lot of the MMC exclusives too.
261 2018-11-06 21:38:23 Me too... s&p down... bonds down... international stocks down... us large companies down. About the only sector doing well is technology and it expensive to get into.

263 2018-11-06 21:37:19 It sad to think that stocks are the only that most pundits and wealthy seems to measure as to whether or not if the economy is doing good or things are good in USA.  Healthy economy should be how well people are doing overall in providing for their families.
264 2018-11-06 21:37:09 Since 1946 there have been 18 mid term elections. After 12 months stocks have been higher all 18 times, averaging 17% and up 32% from the lowest point. -Marketwatch
265 2018-11-06 21:36:35 I used to trade only higher priced stocks. But, I'm 7 or 8 months into mostly pennystock trading and prefer it. Looks like potential for a lot greater gains once you get the process down and train yourself to not over trade.
266 2018-11-06 21:36:32 I've alerted nothing by winning trades since I've started my private feed. It's been awesome! Thank you everyone for the support and I'm glad I can help you make money!

311 2018-11-06 21:14:46 Mkt commentary is clearly that mid terms are bullish for stocks whatev result. Numbers don't really validate that. No idea what result will be. Even if I knew the outcome I would have zero confidence in translating that to a return. Plenty of experts out there though.

Why should I sell it? I believe that 12 months from now it will be much highers due to buybacks in increase in dividends

I know it is a strange list of tickers - but with the midterms currently going on, the are worth in terms of buying on the dip!
383 2018-11-06 20:33:29 i think the gist of stocks is that they raise and lower in value based on economic performance. so just buy stock that you think will go up in value. analyze the markets!
384 2018-11-06 20:32:23 Is it time to sell or buy stocks?
385 2018-11-06 20:31:58 The trouble with egos like Eisman is they think they are really important. Sure he may cause a little local trouble for a short period of time but stock markets ALWAYS bounce back, especially with undervalued stocks, like the ones he may short.

418 2018-11-06 20:11:50 For me it's insufficient volume.  I don't like stocks that get a 400K volume candle and then have volume drop off to like < 100K.  Not enough violent washouts and instant bounces, the "washouts" are followed by grinders.  Usually these are high risk for infinite dump rugpull
419 2018-11-06 20:10:48 My 401K made $8000 in one week. Overall gain this year was twice what is was in 2015. Maybe you better check who you’re investing with. My stocks are up as well.

"Since 1946 there have been 18 midterm elections. Stocks were higher 12 months after every single one. That's 18 for 18."

444 2018-11-06 19:52:55 There also seems to be so inorganic manipulative price action on $BOXL making it not very fluid.  Big bigs and big offers all day long, you just know there's always a high risk of a random rug pull of all the bids for an infinite dump on these kind of stocks.
445 2018-11-06 19:51:15 $SPY Many think profit taking is after stocks go lower, based mainly on a 5 min chart. Truth is profit taking is also going on, higher. :)

491 2018-11-06 19:22:51 Just an instinct, but if stocks close down, they are probably sniffing out a Dem's taking of the House and if stocks close down big, a Blue Wave.

Most politicians cant answer a yes or no question. Some people can't handle Trump's honest answers I guess.
511 2018-11-06 19:10:44 I earned a lot of money with stocks which are currently worth ten times less than before. That doesn't mean that their business was financially sustainable all the time.

631 2018-11-06 18:11:17 I’m not voting. I’m buying stocks. Now leave me alone. 
632 2018-11-06 18:10:56 BUY STOCKS!
633 2018-11-06 18:10:55 $AMZN 1698 is a key short-term level and break above would expose 1820 - 1873 area next in the stock #Elliottwave #AMZN #Stocks #Trading
634 2018-11-06 18:10:39 Lying Joe...it's chicken pox, dumbass & other diseases, possibly including one that the CDC can't even put a name on. Small pox was eradicated but experts also suspect Iran, China, India, Syria, & Israel of having illicit
stocks of the virus. Why? For Biowar.
635 2018-11-06 18:09:48 now I'm investing in penny stocks on the marketplace of ideas!

637 2018-11-06 18:09:04 There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks. 131
638 2018-11-06 18:08:59 When I was a kid my grandmother (lifelong Saints supporter) would regularly say things we all thought were really old fashoined like “they should bring back the stocks for those football hooligans. The shame of it would sort them out”. Maybe twitter is what she wished for?!!
639 2018-11-06 18:08:08 Je suis pour une hausse massive des carburants. Cela sera la fin des importations à bas coûts. La fin des stocks sur la route. La fin des transhumances sauvagyect.. #SansMoiLe17
640 2018-11-06 18:07:38 @AttractaMooney  Re smart beta article. Hits my sweet spot: what is the best way to select stocks? Most active/semi-active strategies are under the cosh - inevitable given the narrowness of stock picking particularly limited macro consideration? ... to be cont....
641 2018-11-06 18:07:31 Think you need to calm down pal. I usually calm myself down by trading in stocks, dm me for more info 
642 2018-11-06 18:05:53 Yes definitely Stocks! I always felt like I was in WP when I was there. Haha.
643 2018-11-06 18:05:22 Here's one other thing I'm going to point out (again). What's ripping higher to multi-week/multi-year highs? Recession-ish/"Safe Money" names like $KO, $CLX, $XLP. What's still trading heavy and closer to multi-month lows? Overhyped, overowned growth/#FAANG stocks
644 2018-11-06 18:03:10 Some excellent action on stocks today.
645 2018-11-06 18:02:30 Sell your coins/stocks/etc while they’re still worth... whatever amount it is at any given second.
646 2018-11-06 18:02:25 I have no fear.  I just want jobs for everyone, my 401K to go keep climbing.  Fear comes from Democrats saying stocks will plummet if Trump wins.  Best market in the world under Trump!
647 2018-11-06 18:01:53 It's funny, but I see a lot of wisdom in @thefaceberg's advice to buy wine company stocks.

Cool Wine Aunt is a meme, but millions of people have bought into it, and they will be buying wine for the next 30+ years.
648 2018-11-06 18:01:44 I’m on the Robinhood app to check on my stocks and cryptocurrency and I’m in the comments section for the cryptocurrency I purchased to see what people are saying about it and everyone is just talking about politics 
649 2018-11-06 18:01:25 You really have these beliefs?

651 2018-11-06 18:01:01 How #Midterms2018 will effect America...

If #Republicans retain control, Americans will buy stocks.
If #Democrats take control of one or both houses and governorships, Americans will buy guns.

656 2018-11-06 17:59:59 Stocks rally into US mid-term election - the market is buying the rumor. I'd rather sell the news but if $SPX can break 2765 (the largest volume resistance right around the corner) stocks may squeeze enough to continue bull run. My book is net short $ES_F
657 2018-11-06 17:59:10 Why do you judge?  Essentially all she’s saying is to be nice to each other. Isn’t that what Jesus would do?
658 2018-11-06 17:58:46 Here's a question.
Premise: Fed's Powell is a hawk and doesn't want to see any inflation overshooting, plus he likes jobs and state of the economy, looks like he doesn't give a coin toss 'bout stocks. 
Dem or Rep win can't derail him. 
Or can sustained 'moral suasion' derail him?
659 2018-11-06 17:56:37 At midday, Mortgage Bonds are near unchanged. Stocks higher. 10-yr yield at 3.21%.
660 2018-11-06 17:56:11 Saudi Arabia owns more Twitter stocks than @jack does.
661 2018-11-06 17:56:06 Not always. I have a 25 yr old daughter who does not walk or talk with a seizure disorder. I work and I care for her but would not make it without help. I wish people would stop generalizing and consider individuals.
662 2018-11-06 17:56:06 Stocks higher soon after the opening bell. Dow +80 points.
663 2018-11-06 17:55:52 Seems to me that oil stocks showing positive divergence bc they’re not down as much as oil... you looking to buy soon?
664 2018-11-06 17:55:51 This is why I have two cats, they couldn’t give a shit about kerning or paper stocks.
665 2018-11-06 17:55:46 You shouldn’t be in the stock market if you don’t understand that market corrections are healthy and inevitable. Only matters to 410k if you sell. If you need retirement money short-term you shouldn’t be in stocks.
666 2018-11-06 17:55:02 I swear girls get everything ugh lol Just make me a girl for 72 hours I swear to GOD ill show you bitches how to come down the slide.

667 2018-11-06 17:54:43 My stocks!
668 2018-11-06 17:54:04 u just started stocks mikey
669 2018-11-06 17:53:45 Does that mean stocks are going to drop 30% otherwise?  Feeding corporations with deficit spending tax cuts is foolish financial engineering that won’t create lasting prosperity.  Wealth is created through investment not consumption.
670 2018-11-06 17:52:49 @CNNPolitics GET A GRIP! Maybe jobs  increased but wages haven't n the cost of living is skyrocketed! All those kids in cages added jobs. So did ICE  Attorneys n part time jobs.
GOP Tax fraud made big co's richer 2 reinvest in their OWN STOCKS!! Fake picture of USA. It's WORSE!!
671 2018-11-06 17:52:34 Sorry to burst your bubble and all, but stocks having performed well following midterms in the past does NOT mean they *always* will.... $SPY $SPX

674 2018-11-06 17:51:39 Sell off all stocks as the markets may tank if democrats take both house and senate. Start hiding money in my mattress, buy more guns and ammo, and tighten my finances for higher taxes to come as a start and cancel my tv as not to hear all the crap the media will spew.
675 2018-11-06 17:51:29 What are you talking about? He sold some stocks to buy more stocks 14 days ago. Warrants u know
676 2018-11-06 17:50:39 pot stocks on the move, watch $GCAN- been moving hard lately and looks like it will benefit even more from the action
677 2018-11-06 17:49:52 Every single valuation metric I know of says US stocks are expensive. But to each his own, if you think they’re cheap that’s cool too. That’s what makes a market....
678 2018-11-06 17:49:45 Stocks and shares ISA is good, no?
679 2018-11-06 17:48:55 Crypto Stocks and Crypto should heat shortly. Should be a good end of the year for all of us
680 2018-11-06 17:48:52 ...and stocks will drop (and/or rise) 15% at some point regardless of what happens with the midterms, or even if the midterms weren’t happening at all. #unremarkable

682 2018-11-06 17:47:47 Well just so happens that because there is so much money being dumped into these stocks AKA FANG w/out the F (FB).  Logic would tell you that if they go down they take the markets with them and vice versa.
683 2018-11-06 17:46:54 @marksandspencer  Hi - I'm trying to find out availability of beauty advent calendars in stores near my home / work, but keep getting stuck on a recorded message when I try to call the store direct. What is the best way to find out which stores still have stocks?
684 2018-11-06 17:46:27 Anyone into Stocks!?
685 2018-11-06 17:46:20 Unemployment low stocks high, but wages have only gone up 3%.
686 2018-11-06 17:45:47 It's a process that commonly takes place in the OTC when stocks go through a repetitive cycle. Can explain in more detail later > 
687 2018-11-06 17:45:44 You don't happen to know who stocks the lightshade and fitting you are wearing on your head do you? Is it a 'fascinator'? Interesting look!
688 2018-11-06 17:45:41 Well we're partying on their credit cards and on the 1 yr anniversary of the mass killing in LV(over 500 dead and wounded) from modified automatic weapons, still no federal ban on bump stocks. 
But don't tell the kids!#Midterms2018
689 2018-11-06 17:44:57 CNN now saying "keep these five charts in mind as people head to polls" saying US added quarter million jobs recently, that unemployment at half century low; stocks up 25%, the "Trump bump," if @realDonaldTrump complains about CNN coverage he should watch this @happningnow
690 2018-11-06 17:43:26 "Linke Tasche - rechte Tasche". Es gibt ca. 8 Mrd. USD die in den Exchanges frei zirkulieren. DASHUSD zeigt, wie der Ablauf ist. Kursanstieg wie bei BCH &  XRP. Dann lässt das Interesse nach und es geht wieder zurück auf "Anfang". Erinnert sehr an den Sektor der "Penny Stocks".
691 2018-11-06 17:41:34 Gamer sentiment at announcements is a poor metric for game stocks, as it turns out. 
Shame I bought stock in them weeks ago, though. Time to double down.
692 2018-11-06 17:41:04 Pot stocks rally toward sixth-straight gain ahead of midterm elections
693 2018-11-06 17:40:40 Almost all cobalt stocks green. $KAT suspended the sale of cobalt from one of its largest mines due to the presence of uranium
694 2018-11-06 17:40:16 As a hardcore @Blizzard_Ent fanboy dating all the way back to Warcraft I, I'm really disappointed at this year's #BlizzCon. No wonder stocks are down all year.
695 2018-11-06 17:39:04 Ils ont déjà fumé les stocks? 
696 2018-11-06 17:38:06 Sell stocks
697 2018-11-06 17:36:34 Yes. Isn't it funny that those who pay the least in taxes expect the most from our government. Actually it's sad.

704 2018-11-06 17:33:05 CNBC has found yet another way to spread pre-election fear! Guess what? Only about half of Americans have stock investments- mostly 401k type accounts. If stocks continue to fall, it’s the wealthy who’ll lose. They can afford it- they got their big tax cut!

708 2018-11-06 17:31:47 Markets are nervous due to elections but this will have little effect on long term gains of the markets, I suspect the Melt Up or extreme move up will continue and not give up til about Feb, get on board lots of good stocks pulled back and are bargains.

712 2018-11-06 17:31:09 General Electric sells its corporate lighting business to a financial investor. The lighting subsidiary Current go to American Industrial Partners, said the group. The deal should be completed in the spring, the selling price was not mentioned #stocks #economy #money

714 2018-11-06 17:30:07 At this point, stocks are poised to go up in rest of the year because investors just want a certainty. Bypassing the mid year election is getting rid of an uncertainty, regardless of the outcome. $AMZN $GOOG $FB $TSLA

719 2018-11-06 17:26:52 Same could be said about Motilal as well right. They have a process to ride on growth stocks and one or two picks here and there may fail in the process. U don't like them is it?
720 2018-11-06 17:26:35 According to @TrinityAssetMan the S&P 500 earnings yield has been firmly above 6% for three straight weeks, the direct result of a bad October for #stocks amidst (another) very strong earnings season. The last time we saw earnings yield >6% was in late 2015 / early 2016.

730 2018-11-06 17:21:35 The problem with cannabis-based securities is that they advertise outcomes in places like the US where their main product is against the law. I'm pro-legalization, but even so, what cannabis stocks are doing is ripping off investors with promises they can't keep.
731 2018-11-06 17:21:32 My stocks are just lounging around like "oh, we're not sure what we're doing today" ...

739 2018-11-06 17:18:18 And the ruleset isnt as arbitrary as you think. Its an attempt to level the playing field. They take out items to ensure fairness, take out stages with lethal hazards, and set x amount of stocks, and its all down to how you play/know your character/MU and knowing your setting.
740 2018-11-06 17:18:12 Does the market have to go to new highs or can good stocks make you money while over priced move lower and market tread water?

743 2018-11-06 17:17:27 For 90% of stocks, that mostly works. But you have to still stay informed. If you don’t want to watch your money, you don’t belong in the stock market. Buy a CD.

747 2018-11-06 17:14:50 Good for you. Sometimes bad situations incentivise good situations. With regards investments, you should put 20k per annum in isa share dealing account. Tax free gains with right stocks.

762 2018-11-06 17:04:19 People don’t realize they can call the billing company to have the cost adjusted>often,not always

The middleman mark up is due to Republicans (& some Dems) deeply invested in keeping the high cost system in tact. They directly benefit via pol donations, stocks and lobbying jobs
763 2018-11-06 17:03:59 “Invest in funeral home stocks. Your kids will be rich when you die.”
764 2018-11-06 17:02:50 Rather own bond closed end funds at big discounts....better yield and lower risk...$MREIT stocks have just too much leverage right now.
765 2018-11-06 17:02:45 No words...well, polite ones! 
Stocks on the market square...rotten food etc...
766 2018-11-06 17:02:37 Put that money in stocks and triple that profit b!!!
767 2018-11-06 17:02:13 both sides can learn from each other in a more professional way instead of coming off as some kind of fool when one goes wild as are so many social media types that fill sites with mostly personal insults and or hyping stocks to moon or bashing stocks to 0 24/7.  latest fools....

769 2018-11-06 17:01:25 We're seeing a similar market as two years ago, as stocks sold off in October while gold rose. After the election, the opposite happened. This time, stocks are down and gold is up.

La députée MOTIN site "les stocks" acheté + cher le mois dernier.? Ou sont passé les stocks acheté à 50€ Le baril? Qui à constaté une baisse flagrante à la pompe, suivant de près la baisse du brut?
771 2018-11-06 17:01:16 @kotaksecurities Hi, do you'll allow trading in US stocks for Indian residents?
772 2018-11-06 17:01:16 Lower oil, less inflation. Growth with less inflation should be good for stocks.
What else is the market looking at?
773 2018-11-06 17:00:38 Earnings strong but just doesn't feel right. I need to earn but forcing it doesn't turn out well. Long term cannabis stocks but that was rough on 11 trading days down 40%
774 2018-11-06 17:00:30 As traders we want to avoid trading when the market is in consolidation as it is the hardest condition to make profits.

777 2018-11-06 16:59:34 Note to all, and this IS investment advice.

1. Update spouse on green days.
2. Take spouse to dinner on red days.  This is not the time to discuss stocks.

Rinse and repeat.
778 2018-11-06 16:59:17 many stocks hit a wall as soon as the tax breaks went into effect.  Some momentum names ( HEAR etc) performed well even after, but have started to falter.  Any bad news on this front means these high flying names might get hit even harder...
779 2018-11-06 16:57:10 10:55am CST: Stocks at intraday lows (watch for buy opportunities): $BABA, $BILI, $MOMO (Chinese ADRs), $SLB, $UCO, $FTI, $GDX, $MRVL, $NFLX, $SLV.

795 2018-11-06 16:50:50 So if I read the market correctly today the Fed wants us to buy pot stocks with no earnings and staples at the highest valuations ever with rising rates.  Hmmm I wonder why I have such little faith in our system these days.
796 2018-11-06 16:50:36 Absolutely! Past two weeks I haven’t made any trades. Just watched all my stocks and crypto nosedive. But now they’re all coming up. Gotta enjoy the ride. I recommend Stash app
797 2018-11-06 16:50:04 I'll buy all the silver like I buy stocks: dollar cost average it. You should buy when you can afford it. Prices tend to be manipulated a lot when it comes to precious metals.

800 2018-11-06 16:49:21 Stocks  may continue to go up...not because Senate will block House in gridlock, but BECAUSE Senate will keep current policy by blocking anti-Business Dem bills coming from House-if they win.

805 2018-11-06 16:47:30 Well put, it's the only one of the major tech stocks that I see as having more depth than what can be seen. AAPL may/may not become more of a service co, FB popularity may erode even more, be less relevant- but Google has lots of arrows in quiver
806 2018-11-06 16:47:03 Sold all my pot stocks to buy $PUFXF (5-10 bagger, it's so undervalued)... I was in $NBEV under $1.50 FYI.

807 2018-11-06 16:46:52 Buffett has been buying equities at a rapid rate over the past five months, spending cash at one of the fastest speeds in recent history.Time to buy stocks? It seems that there has been a dramatic change in Buffett's perception of the market over the past 12 months.
808 2018-11-06 16:46:52 <--- still hates stocks, there will be some back and forth on the election but after that clears it's back to the program: pullback

812 2018-11-06 16:45:02 Bonds and MBS : WHEN fed stops strong USD policy: stocks, bonds (yes bonds even w/o QE), will scream higher, as they welcome liquidity to playball. Then inflation. Then stocks move sideways, then bonds sell off, only then does gold really matter. Bond bull mkt not done IMHO
813 2018-11-06 16:43:32 Another one of those VIX green, dollar green, stocks green days.  Weird.  Someone's really wrong.
814 2018-11-06 16:42:37 I’ll admit, like all of Engro’s other investors, I am furious over a lot of money that I lost in Engro stocks & bonds back in 2012 when the company almost sank.

819 2018-11-06 16:39:09 Yes, Started getting bulled up on these in Q1/Q2 2018.  Uranium prices hitting new multi year highs,  but the rally in the stocks probably are pricing in more than just current Ux prices.
820 2018-11-06 16:38:19 I got a $30K savings account that has paid -Interest paid in 2018: $83.74- and I think that beats all my stocks in 2018

822 2018-11-06 16:38:05 @AOTtrades Discipline poor today.  Bought 2 stocks.  About to be stopped out on one, NIO, and down on TWTR.  Only half positions, logical tight stops so losses will be small but mad at not being patient.  Been really disciplined for weeks now so will take today as an aberration.
823 2018-11-06 16:37:58 Does this make more of a statement about Bitcoin, or US stocks?
824 2018-11-06 16:37:34 No matter who wins the election, stocks could drop by more than 15% because of Republicans' fiscal recklessness.
825 2018-11-06 16:37:00 Yes, in 2009.  Went all-in on stocks and that is how I was able to leave the corporate world for good and eventually retire.  Hoping an opportunity like that arises again, but it looks like that was a once-in-a-lifetime event.
826 2018-11-06 16:36:54 So? How many in Trump's rally buy stocks?

830 2018-11-06 16:32:42 Me, a Mexican who is still underaged, often treated as less in the United States, knows they every time Donal Trump opens his mouth the Mexican Peso goes down in value and the dollar increases and is aware of the drastic stocks devaluation in Mexico, supports this message
831 2018-11-06 16:31:26 Does anyone have a site that displays all of the day's trade for CSE stocks? The only one I can find is limited to the last 25. Trying to get a little more info on API's opening volume.

835 2018-11-06 16:28:50 stocks are still falling
836 2018-11-06 16:28:46 At these levels most of the stocks are ridiculously underpriced. Look at the cost basis on Forsys. Bravo!
837 2018-11-06 16:27:41 Stop the fear mongering. Stocks go up and down for a variety of macro, technical and sheer dumb luck reasons.
838 2018-11-06 16:27:06 Agreed. Been saying that since day 1. Factors into #Fed's Trilemma thesis. When the time comes, they'll have to revert to #QE to prop up prices of both stocks and bonds. The dollar will sacrificed in the process. China, Russia, et al just hedging against this inevitable outcome.
839 2018-11-06 16:26:37 This is just a forewarning - Since 1946, stocks have risen an average of 17% in the year after a midterm. We can expect Trump to either take credit for the increase or attack Dems for the loss.
840 2018-11-06 16:26:25 No not of Werther's thanks, only if they've got Toffos.
But they might be in the Toffee shop, I'm not sure if th Caramel shop stocks them

846 2018-11-06 16:22:28 Policy summary: QT will be considered overdone when stocks drop to say, 2200. Then the Fed will ease or lag in its raising. This is what “permanent debt monetization” looks like. You will see more govt bonds issued at 30 yr again. Pols opt for inflation vs unemployment 3/x

849 2018-11-06 16:18:41 Best I can tell from listening to folks on TV, the midterms may send stocks higher, lower, or keep them in a trading range. SMDH

851 2018-11-06 16:16:49 I’ve seen some of this “government weed”... and if it’s all that quality I would short all the cannabis stocks. @fordnation needs to hurry and make dispensaries legal. Toronto Police have better things to do than protect monopolies. #TOpoli
852 2018-11-06 16:16:29 Spec stocks are constantly mispriced with little analyst or institutional coverage. Investors most often wait to be directed by GURUS & can't price start ups. It presents an opportunity for investors to buy under priced assets and then either wait or explaining why to buy. (pump)
853 2018-11-06 16:16:16 Ahhh. I feel that QT properly done will cause an orderly drop in stocks and a gentle rise in rates. And I think Powell is a man who can do that. That said: and this is not ms I stream I feel (as do many including nuts like TH) that in the end the fed MUST back off strong 1/x

869 2018-11-06 16:07:26 lmao if a blue wave immediately causes stocks to plummet and kicks off the market crash that has been pending since January.
870 2018-11-06 16:06:35 $qqq. Tech stocks really acting poorly this morning.
871 2018-11-06 16:06:21 Not sure the question context. “That” meaning what. Not to be dense. That said: pure conjecture- QT remains in place until dollar drainage finally crushes stocks here down to 2000. Then QT ends, debt still issued, dollar drainage stops. Then stocks scream higher.

883 2018-11-06 15:59:49 For #soybeans, the average trade guess is for a yield of 52.9 bpa vs. 53.1 bpa last month and a production estimate of 4.676 bb vs. 4.690 bb last month. This would place ending stocks at 898 mb vs. 885 mb a month ago

887 2018-11-06 15:56:31 $TSLA Looks like today is a lousy day for any stocks to run. Assuming a decent market bounce after the midterms are tallied - and that's a big assumption - My gut is the old highs around $390

894 2018-11-06 15:54:03 Even if WTI goes to $80, Canadian energy stocks will remain in the gutter. Most of them are breakeven at $65 WTI and that is with normalized spreads. We need sustained $85+ pricing for investors to jump back in. The political and investment climate in Canada does not help either.

930 2018-11-06 15:41:09 How do you get started in investing.

Easiest way... look up Vanguard ETFs. 

Find an ETF that focuses on the economy the  or one that follows FANG stocks. 

I wouldn’t invest anything below $500

1015 2018-11-06 15:10:29 If the Democrats take the House. Stocks will dive. If they take the House and the Senate, the system will collapse.

Oh and Mueller will go on a rampage.

1016 2018-11-06 15:09:50 Perhaps Peterffy means that if Democrats win both houses stocks could drop 15% and if they don't stocks could drop 20%?
1017 2018-11-06 15:07:09 We always have to determine "what kind of market we're in."  Is it a strong bull market? Are stocks making good, sustained moves? If not, we adjust our tactics so we can make some money. Don't argue with the markets.
1018 2018-11-06 15:07:09 That was some bull rush at open. As if stocks were being goven away
1019 2018-11-06 15:06:32 Stay with my iPhone 7, Sell the iPhone X for what it’s worth, take that 6G, invest 2G in Weed, it’s going to be a booming industry soon enough, 1.5G goes into a few stocks & bonds, diverse the portfolio a bit then lay low with the other 2G to sure up any loses, $500 gets pocketed
1020 2018-11-06 15:06:01 Agree except there are some powerful statistics. Every GOP president in 100 years has had a 1st term recession. But it's not absolute. This could be the 1st American decade without one. It could be short and over by 2020. Stocks know this. They remember govt shutdowns also.
1021 2018-11-06 15:05:39 How does that impact stocks?
1022 2018-11-06 15:05:08 In the same vein, I don't understand how the economy is considered such a positive for him. A large majority of people got basically squat for a tax cut, stocks being high only helps people who own stocks and investors, and it's not about the economy anyway!

1024 2018-11-06 15:04:42 $BOXL Since today is slow, be ready for low float stocks to move. The majority of these plays will not hold their gains so lock in quickly. No trade for myself, but want to help anyone who may think holding all day is a good idea.

1056 2018-11-06 14:52:34 Someone actually just reminded me of FAANG stocks. (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google). These are high performing tech stocks. Great pick but again can't put all your money into Tech.
1057 2018-11-06 14:51:44 Can’t find it, but curious what % of Americans own stocks in a taxable account? I’d guessing 10-20% tops.

1059 2018-11-06 14:51:06 Stocks moving higher on hope post election. Led by tech stocks that are way beaten down.  Some rumors of progress with #China so G20 will be important. Hopefully a nice Fed this week. $aapl $dis
1060 2018-11-06 14:50:55 Tech stocks are too volatile right now, not unless it's MSFT
1061 2018-11-06 14:49:55 stocks are trading like Republican' won already :)
1062 2018-11-06 14:49:45 I agree. Commodity stocks always look super cheap at the peak. Today's price action after solid earnings is another sign. I don't think GE pricing will decline but even if it stops rising, it'll hurt the massively elevated sentiment in GE stocks capping the upside from here.
1063 2018-11-06 14:49:02 It literally feels like being in the 90’s of internet.

1082 2018-11-06 14:42:11 Depends. If Senate and House have veto override, they can pass reversal of tax bill and others and override Presidential veto. That happens, I am selling all my stocks.
1083 2018-11-06 14:42:08 Is Peterffy implying that if Democrats fail to win both houses of Congress that stocks cannot drop 15%? An old options trader like Peterffy should know better than that.

1138 2018-11-06 14:23:36 Not much on watch today - mainly OTC pot stocks - but hoping to see another green day today before any moves. $ITHUF $ORHOF $EMHTF $TGODF
1139 2018-11-06 14:23:35 With that said, I have met quite a few good people that act professionally on social media about stocks and the markets in general like @BullishBearz @SetYourStop @effectemergence @Empiretrader82 @marinif @kelkun @savestacks @Senceidentity @Scottrades plus you know who you are 
1140 2018-11-06 14:23:24 The cost of housing has risen due to materials now thanks to the tariffs. Farmers are now being supported by welfare thanks to the  tariffs. Stocks are down. Companies have closed & are moving to Mexico. Its really not a bright future for people who currently don’t own shit.
1141 2018-11-06 14:22:24 I see stocks hit bottom on 5 minutes chart are:
$NVDA
$NFLX
1142 2018-11-06 14:21:58 Lol carbon tax....  it’s just money poured into an idea that is traded like stocks by countries ... nothing changes.. you want change, fix India and China...
1143 2018-11-06 14:20:30 U.S. stocks were on track to open slightly lower on Tuesday, as investors awaited the outcome of U.S. midterm elections that could shape the future of Donald Trump's presidency and test his tax and trade policies.
1144 2018-11-06 14:20:07 Amazing how stocks go  and 

Which of this applies to you Fantasy GMs? #NewYorkForever

1145 2018-11-06 14:19:56 I'm so glad to hear that you invest in stocks. But yeah game companies are usually risky anytime they announce something they almost always go down in then usually rise back after time.
1146 2018-11-06 14:19:50 That is why I rather buy a Chanel or Hemes, consistent classic fashion houses. They're basically like stocks!
1147 2018-11-06 14:19:24 In the good old days, these people would be put in the stocks and pelted with rancid vegetables. Nowadays they get to vote and spout bollocks on the internet
1148 2018-11-06 14:19:04 Next up..... The Air Arms Tx200 MK3 and the TX200 HC both built on the same action, the MK3 measures 41.5” the HC measures 39.25” both under leavers in .177 with beach stocks. Both have built in moderators and adjustable two stage triggers.

1150 2018-11-06 14:18:29 Billionaire investor David Einhorn's hedge fund Greenlight Capital posted a small gain in October, when stocks tumbled, but is still nursing some of the industry's biggest losses for the year, an investor said on Wednesday.

1154 2018-11-06 14:16:30 Since Trump's election,the S&P 500 has risen over 27%.-better than the early months of  Clinton, Reagan & George W. Bush. Obama's numbers were higher,but stocks were coming back from the depths of a financial crisis.
1155 2018-11-06 14:16:18 Still don’t have a great feel for the market right here yet. Weakness in big tech being ignored is a curve ball. Value stocks look like the place to be. $VIX still high. Will wait until I am more confident in a bias before putting on anything aggressively.
1156 2018-11-06 14:15:26 Honestly if all my stocks break even I’ll be happy

1193 2018-11-06 13:57:08 Business Math

Stocks - shares in the ownership of the company.

Bonds - interest bearing security which promises to pay amount of money on a certain maturity date as stated in the bond certificate.

Dividend - share in the company's profit.

1203 2018-11-06 13:53:45 Why does my view of a free market mean I am “pro tout”? They are not the same thing and you can’t see past that - which is frustrating. 

Do you have a problem with the resale of; stocks, cars or property?

I don’t have to agree with touts, to support a free, transparent market.

1207 2018-11-06 13:49:28 Study the Norwegian model.
Instead of privatizing the oilfields, tax The Global Elite´s Operators 85%, which is then reinvested in The Global Elite´s Financial papers, like Stocks, Bonds and Currency.
An insignificant amount is returned, to cover Norway´s deficit.

1237 2018-11-06 13:31:46 @CNN @hardball Here is why 55% or 58% of people think the economy is doing well. It’s because 52% of households own stock. If you own stocks, and the stock market is the primary measure of economy success then you believe the economy is humming along. Ask those without healthcare

big thing but even bigger thing if Reps lose the House.
1261 2018-11-06 13:17:44 You are absolutely right. But I prefer it that way with max 25 stocks.
As average holding period is about 46 days I keep it diversified so that I don’t miss out on new opportunities. Also because I do not check the fundamentals if Vakrangi PCJ happens not much of an issue as well

1277 2018-11-06 13:07:49 Fascinating indeed, but it's horribly drawn -should have been two lines on LHS + a ratio/spread on RHS. Anyhow:
1. Recent jump could have been repatriation driven (but there was a spike pre-08 also)
2. Buying own stocks at these levels indicates widespread C-suite myopia

1279 2018-11-06 13:05:05 Brexit is exerting pressure on OEM schedules for 2019. Two-way trade of LVs between the UK and Europe was 2.6 mn last year (UK exports 0.7 mn, EU imports 1.9 mn). If the sector stockpiles an additional month of stocks in Q1 this would boost Euro stocks by 200k.

1505 2018-11-06 10:08:01 I find it incredibly frustrating that he's smart enough to realise that depleted stocks of council homes is a serious problem but daft enough to produce this authoritarian, unworkable mess. Doesn't take much thought to see why it's not a goer!
1506 2018-11-06 10:07:53 Yes we want it, but we don't want the Democrats to raise our taxes and destroy jobs to get it. We aren't rich like Hollywood.  People use your brain, Vote for the Republicans. JOBS ARE BETTER. PAY IS HIGHER, STOCKS ARE RISING.  THE REASON IS, WE HAVE A BUSINESS MAN RUNNING THINGS
1507 2018-11-06 10:06:20 #RT @meirbarak: @GingerHeadTrade @TradenetAcademy When trading stocks with a high liquidity, you will continue to be filled at the Bid/Ask price. 3 cents is the guaranteed maximum.
1508 2018-11-06 10:06:19 #RT @meirbarak: @PerryKadeem The 3-cent Market order is intended to improve execution on mid-to-high liquid stocks and eliminates the need of using limit orders; allowing you get into any trade - usually being filled at Bid/Ask Or with a maximum of 3 cents from the Best Bid/…
1509 2018-11-06 10:06:18 #RT @meirbarak: @newtrader123451 @TradenetAcademy I suggest that you trade stocks with a tighter spread, using a market order. TLRY had over a 30 cents spread in this screen capture. Under 5 cents spread stocks is what I advise you trade.

1511 2018-11-06 10:02:21 Amazon what a shame. You have being walking off workers out of your facility in Arizona   Just because is a right to work state. You using that to get rid of the senior worker who had some kind of stocks in amazon. Being new employees will not get any stocks. No more amazon here

1516 2018-11-06 09:52:52 Not a great deal going on now and not much expected with the US elections today: Until we start getting exit polls later. Stocks and bonds very quiet so FX rather stuck in a range..
1517 2018-11-06 09:52:16 When trading stocks with a high liquidity, you will continue to be filled at the Bid/Ask price. 3 cents is the guaranteed maximum.

Remember! 

Nomatter how many Trillions you have in your account, stocks, hardware wallet,it doesnt matter if the stores are empty.If stocks, bonds n housing "dies".  1/2
1519 2018-11-06 09:48:40 If the people on the right had done a little more research from credible sources they would have found that man has harmed many. For a few more pennies from your taxes & gain on your stocks, we have lost peace, civility, principles & the meaning of America. Where is your dignity?

1522 2018-11-06 09:44:02 Yes, but you forget that hundreds if not thousands or tens of thousands, every single day, buy stocks, only to sell them at a later date. This causes stocks to go up and down outside of company blunders, and only part of it is day traders, who operate every single day.
1523 2018-11-06 09:43:26 Unemployment is down because every household needs two to three jobs to survive, single parents included. Economy is up because CEO's are buying their own stocks. If I get an extra $ in my check but every thing else goes up then I am not better off!
1524 2018-11-06 09:41:14 The 3-cent Market order is intended to improve execution on mid-to-high liquid stocks and eliminates the need of using limit orders; allowing you get into any trade - usually being filled at Bid/Ask Or with a maximum of 3 cents from the Best Bid/Ask price on less liquid stocks.
1525 2018-11-06 09:40:32 Indeed, all the media continues these falsehoods of a booming economy, employment growth, raise increase. These same ones who benefited from #TaxScam reinvested in their own stocks, (which in turns shows economic growth that is not the rest of the population) ignoring inflation
1526 2018-11-06 09:39:33 For an investor, the main concern is to have assets that perform in a non-correlated fashion to stocks and bonds. If the market has a meltdown alternative investments eg crypto assets may help steady the ship #intelligentinvestor #Crypto

1531 2018-11-06 09:33:32 True! With price action we need to time our entries and exit to make the best out of options buy trades. I have identified handful on highly liquid option stocks in which I play for 50-100% gains.

1582 2018-11-06 08:54:38 401K is your gauge? Stock market will fall and rise. Over the long-term, you need the drops so that you can buy stocks "on sale". Naivete is no excuse for ignorance.

A few years ago, people gauged their worth based on their bubble driven house prices...
1583 2018-11-06 08:53:27 Of the few stocks I had seen. Reliance was the best looking short canditate overall. Somehow price not budged. After all we need to obey what price says and it matters. Still not convinced with this move. A deep crack below 1k Soon there. Would look for rentry !

Sir if possible 

post stock cash positional calls long for 1 month 1 week 15 days calls on stocks 

By that risk is negligible 

Nd by that people also can manage in stock options

By predicting calls how far it can go 

Take this as feedback sir only

The big gainers have been #EMs but slipping slightly to 14.2000 this morning. #Gold is hovering around the $1230.00 level and #Oil at $72.80 despite the #USsanctions on Iran coming into effect yesterday.

1758 2018-11-06 05:43:02 So it's your position that no cryptocurrencies, stocks, nor bonds should be criticized because people own them? 

If I was just some idiot saying "Ripple is a shitcoin!11!1!!" or making mean-spirited personal attacks, I'd understand your frustration.

1766 2018-11-06 05:33:16 Apart from 1 or 2 bad ones , my stocks results have been good over all. Can't say how other companies have performed.

Problem is valuations. They are stretched so far that unless companies show extremely good results, stocks will mostly be sideways for 2-3 more quarters.
1767 2018-11-06 05:32:41 I’m buying food and booze stocks, gonna be a lot of drunk fat people for at least the next 6 years
1768 2018-11-06 05:31:52 @cvpayne $HPQ stock looking good.   Since Aug 31st the $COMPQX (NASDAQ) is down 9.62% while $HPQ is down only $.01

Strongest stocks in a correction are often the leaders the next move up.   We shall see regarding $HPQ
1769 2018-11-06 05:30:57 I would love to see the performance of the top percentile of the same size as "value leaders" (~38 stocks) sorted purely on value.

Adding complexity always looks promising when you're narrowing the portfolio, but often , simply using more of the best factor is superior.

1773 2018-11-06 05:28:28 Yes. Tax manufacturers. But taxing by waste might need some thought. For example: a whole chicken is cheaper per pound than, say pre-portioned foods. When I buy a chicken, I actually use the bones for stocks. It's not waste per se, though I do discard them afterwards.
1774 2018-11-06 05:27:47 
1775 2018-11-06 05:26:46 Value investing is dead. It is difficult to find a company that isn't already far over priced in relation to the metrics used in his time to purchase companies. Stocks are far too speculative now for that.
1776 2018-11-06 05:26:03 Best tip for ranging market's? Add a 12 and 26 DMA. Look for buys when 26 > 12. Look for sells when 12 > 26. Works with most stocks, $BTC, $SPX, Most things you could think of. #stocks #investing #investments #crypto #cryptocurrency #btcusd #SPX #QQQ

1882 2018-11-06 03:34:12 It's large cap universe only. So total number is ~500 stocks, give or take. Top quintile leaves 100. Remove traps (about 25%), then cut remainder in half, you end up with ~38 large cap stocks on average, give or take.

1888 2018-11-06 03:29:29 I don’t know. This type of stocks I feel is for pure long term story. Good dividend, occasional bonus. Slow and steady growth. A stock which can be passed to next generation.

1900 2018-11-06 03:18:30 Stocks are never good evidence that a company is going downhill, as there's multiple different kinds of stocks, and all of them do not work organically.

1910 2018-11-06 03:14:37 Not GE IR issue. It’s the overall market issue. The market selectively pumps up stocks that big money wants, and ignores stocks which they don’t want.

1912 2018-11-06 03:13:01 @hardball Here is why 55% or 58% of people think the economy is doing well. It’s because in 52% of households owned stock. If you own stocks, and the stock market is the primary measure of economy success then you believe the economy is humming along. Ask those without healthcare
1913 2018-11-06 03:11:21 Are you still primarily shorting or have you been working on your long game more now?
1914 2018-11-06 03:11:19 You say $BRK 's MD, David Prentice is not employed by Cicero but he and Loren King are both on your website as 'your people" and they are in other of your spec stocks, is that right like $LRM.?

1915 2018-11-06 03:10:57 U.S. Market Check
U.S. stocks climbed, with Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. powering gains in the S&P 500 Index.
The yield on 10-year Treasuries held at 3.20 percent.

1919 2018-11-06 03:06:55 Neither.  I think you may be unfamiliar with the concept of a straw man fallacy.  Also, animals have always recovered from historical fluctuations.  But it took a while, and at that time we didn't depend on e.g. fish stocks to feed 8B people.
1920 2018-11-06 03:06:18 "Bad news is an investor's best friend. It lets you buy a slice of America's future at a marked-down price." - Warren Buffett (in a 2008 op-ed to the New York Times).

1922 2018-11-06 03:03:07 Yeah that's what has me so excited.  Way faster movement + high damage outputs: stocks getting burned through
1923 2018-11-06 03:02:16 Don’t like lying, especially when it’s blatantly done. Trump boasts of economy, when you deregulate all the environmental protections of course jobs will be created but at what cost. When you give a 1.5 trillion tax cut to corporations and they invest 80% of it in stocks buybacks
1924 2018-11-06 03:01:40 Netflix has a weighted cost of capital equal to 13.68%. To lower this percentage the company would have to increase the debt to equity. This could be done if they issue more bonds than stocks. #Fin2209 @ProfLowell

1940 2018-11-06 02:48:54 Someone 50+ should not have more than 40-50% in stocks unless they plan to work beyond 10 more years

Equities climbed in Japan, Australia and South Korea, while Hong Kong and China futures also tipped gains.
1968 2018-11-06 02:17:20 Yeah. I don't think getting greedy is how we put fuel in transportation, shipping and selling products from place to place, or keeping the stocks in check while making a profit. That'll cause more damage than good.

Even a janitor knows that a decade long of low interest rates makes a bubble, where consumer are able to buy Amazon goods, while investor could buy Amazon stocks.
1971 2018-11-06 02:13:28 Low unemployment is because people have to work two crap jobs to survive. Wages are rising for the rich, not the poor or middle class. Low taxes are causing catastrophic debt. The economy is only strong for rich people investing in stocks.

1989 2018-11-06 01:55:53 Bump stocks have been on the market for nearly 9 years after approval by President Obama’s ATF.  They were used by ONE deranged individual in ONE event, so you believe that the hundreds of thousands which are owned by law abiding citizens should be banned?
1990 2018-11-06 01:52:43 Just remember majority of people don’t own stocks. You daddy’s tax cut went to the rich and corporations.  So we are not “all” better off.
1991 2018-11-06 01:52:37 This is more true than most know. Further #bitcoin is approximately 40bps vs US stocks, 15 bps global stocks. Its not even a pimp,e on the @@s of an elephant.# imagine how much it can go up. Bitcoin the highest quality, least expensive, most misunderstood asset globally.

1997 2018-11-06 01:47:41 If I were an investment advisor (I am NOT) I would sell all stocks if the democrats take the House. TWO more years of HATE cannot be good for the economy or America.
1998 2018-11-06 01:47:32 Shame we never hold Wall St accountable for bubble stocks though. Easy money is never an excuse for "smart" money managers to value AMZN at 200 PE. Same thing happened during dotcom bust, when low interest rates weren't the problem.

2008 2018-11-06 01:39:36 Stocks work by shares or units if u wanna call it. So example a Nike shares cost 20$ and u want 5 shares. 20x5= smart investment

2089 2018-11-06 00:40:34 Bond prices and yields are inverse. So as rates rise, price for bonds fall. That is true but I don’t think you can make any determination on the price of stocks off of that alone. Bonds were in a 30 bull market from the 80s thru last year and stocks had many cycles.

Another way, increasingly undertaken by universities, faith groups and recently even at a countrywide level, is to ‘divest’ funds out of polluting activities – such as avoiding stocks in fossil fuels, or banks that invest in high-emission
2102 2018-11-06 00:30:12 What drives that narrative? The stock market, its been bullish since March 2009 but after the tax cut, stocks growth accelerated, because of corporate buybacks due to tax cuts. Has nothing to do with the health of the economy. Made the market more volatile as it crashed already

2126 2018-11-06 00:10:46 ie, no sequential index w/ changing contents, just all the stocks in all the years thrown together into one huge pot (and take the avg future 1 yr return).

2128 2018-11-06 00:09:08 Finally, there is a difference in the way the chart and table were built. Chart shows avg june-to-june returns of an *index* over prior 5 yrs, whereas table shows the arithmetic average future 1 yr return of all stocks in all months in the stated time frame.

2131 2018-11-06 00:05:46 Pro marijuana for sure.  He hasn’t said much on guns that I know of other than being against the sale of bump stocks and plastic weapons.
2132 2018-11-06 00:05:23 Milo, Sargon, and Thunderf00t are all laughing stocks even in their own community of "skeptics" or whatever. Remember Milo's book?The 3 you named only have their relevance and influence tied to such fleeting social happenings they can very effectively be laughed into irrelevance
2133 2018-11-06 00:04:59 It is you capitalist pigs that left Bin Laden in and his gang of suicidal Freedom Fighters. Bin Laden was a capitalist mercenary pimp his stocks went through the roof. And you know what else Billy Bob Freedom ain't free. What mother doesn't worry about her son overseas.
2134 2018-11-06 00:04:39 Short version of my previous 8 tweets: Home Depot no longer gives veterans a 10% discount! Your discount is now capped at 50 bucks! But Home Depot got to buyback 15 BILLION in stocks after the GOP tax cut!!! My advice? Go to Lowes, vets still get 10% off purchases!
2135 2018-11-06 00:04:29 I just had to stop myself from arguing with some fools about how buying stocks/gambling is different.
2136 2018-11-06 00:04:08 Had the pleasure of chatting with Dan @Dpatcoon in person at my office today about stocks etc. Dan = good shit! 
2137 2018-11-06 00:02:42 Are you nuts? This economy's been in lift-off mode since Obama righted repub induced plummeting economy in 2009. All you did was give your rich friends giant tax cuts of which they took advantage of 2 buyback their own stocks to buoy market. The mid-class never got tax break.
