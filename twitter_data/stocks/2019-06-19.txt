7 2019-06-19 23:52:09 Even if stocks weren’t near an all time high, the economy is growing decently, unemployment is at record lows, the world is full of liquidity. Inflation is just under their goal. There is no reason to cut interest rates

15 2019-06-19 23:47:40 Agree. Stocks are in a critical position right now, very fragile. Fed is spinning plates and they are all wobbly at these historic heights. Bubble is in trouble.

38 2019-06-19 23:45:29 And I’m not dissing anyone who works at Walmart. A job is a job. But the guy who runs a company has way more responsibility and tasks and puts in way more hours than someone who stocks a shelf. That’s just the reality of it

41 2019-06-19 23:45:02 I don't disagree. Although fearing stocks as they become more risky sounds pretty sensible to me.  How do you explain this seemingly unexplainable bout of rationality?
42 2019-06-19 23:43:48 Really? You forgot how well US stocks had performed in 2012 and 2013?
43 2019-06-19 23:43:17 Since they like the old days perhaps if they spent time in the stocks or have their ear lobes nailed to the whipping post might suit the good Christians that support the Liar-in-chief
44 2019-06-19 23:42:03 People are going batshit over a 2 minute video that made fun of BTS because... why? It's normal to make fun of boy bands and popular music. Justin Beiber and Taylor Swift have been laughing stocks for years, why would BTS be any different?

47 2019-06-19 23:39:26 Thattttts where I gotta come in. If you’re asking for outside capital or buying picks your investing in a person, not their games day to day. That’s a form of investing regardless of what market. Same as a broker you let pick your stocks/investments.
48 2019-06-19 23:39:18 Ahhh yes MS report one and a half yrs ago is still effecting the GLOBAL lithium stocks, seeing they are all tracking on almost ~2-3 yr lows...... lol Im not disagreeing with any of trhe names and car manufacturers you suggest. Im talking about project economics now and ST
49 2019-06-19 23:36:53 The major resource stocks are already on borrowed time IMO. I think roughly 60% is shipped to China who are in a full blown trade war with our largest allies USA. When push comes to shove. China will shut out Australian exports.

51 2019-06-19 23:35:50 Nice to see NIO stock doing well, up %11 in one day. Now if you are going to enjoy days like today, don’t bash the company when stocks fall. It’s going to be a long ride, it won’t be easy. But you know the saying Stick with me baby and I will take you places
52 2019-06-19 23:34:30 Straw and other forages are not the same thing.
53 2019-06-19 23:33:41 By making Glazers trend they’ve made them worth more, Stocks are up 0.16% 
54 2019-06-19 23:33:41 Great idea. Used to find higher price stocks but then I watched vids where people said it’s best to focus on stocks less than 5.00 or 10.00 if you’re trying to grow an account. Some said keep it under 1.00 lol. But I’m seeing now there’s some gainers in 10+ stocks sometimes too.
55 2019-06-19 23:33:13 @TexasTea210 overnight millionaire dreams are a bunch of bullshit you make money by playing smart moves like this a little by little. And holding good stocks on a long-term basis. 
I’m not gonna lie ,had I went all in on this one I could’ve made $300,000 but hindsight is 2020

58 2019-06-19 23:29:24 LOL~ one of my classmates made the same comment on the logo referring to stocks!

OK, I’ll let the grad program administrator know that you guys, especially one faculty member at Princeton , disliked the logo... because it seems to refer to finance rather than econ! 
59 2019-06-19 23:29:20 US 2 year yield is at 1.75% and below the #Fed funds rate. That last happened 2007 & before that in 2000. Remember what happened to stocks then?

Unit Trust is one of the financial instrument we can sell. By all means, if you have the money, I can even ask fund manager to trade stocks for you.

S&P 500 has rallied 6% this month and is about 1% away from its closing record
65 2019-06-19 23:22:06 Hey @philbak1 - @RA_Insights Arnott just suggested $RVRS style index approach would be best performing style *if* smaller stocks were easier to trade  - he needs to do your podcast!
66 2019-06-19 23:21:16 Wait, you mean we can't eat, drink, and breathe money? Also, I thought everything was fine as long as the 1% who own nearly all of the stocks in the stock market were doing well. I mean, it's not like the bourgeois have ever risen up en mass to overthrow the aristocracy.

69 2019-06-19 23:20:28 Methane is not “produced” by ruminants, it’s part of the natural cycle of plant & animal production where methane is absorbed from atmosphere by plants which is then released at time of digestion
Methane levels are not increasing & livestock numbers are falling globally @GHGGuru
70 2019-06-19 23:20:01 Lets not forget too boycott all @ManUtd  merchandise and tv, social media etc. until we devalue the stocks to drive #GlazersOut 
and deter investment from sponsors not buying anything till they are gone
71 2019-06-19 23:18:44 Bet those military stocks of yours are doing well.
72 2019-06-19 23:18:41 I have a brokerage Roth IRA that has some stocks & mutual funds. I know you can get IRAs w/ bullion, too, but I was not aware property is possible. I assume you mean real estate, right?
73 2019-06-19 23:16:19 unless the person doesn't have social media... then the stocks would suffice.
74 2019-06-19 23:15:55 Yes, the job of a central banker is to out-bully the bully (helping out shorts who are tired of losing). Also, central bankers should not cut even if the economy is weakening because stocks are near ATH, i.e, they should keep their eyes only on the stock market.
75 2019-06-19 23:15:12 TERRA PRIME GROUP stocks pull-back amid troubling geopolitical headlines
76 2019-06-19 23:15:10 I did that until 5000 from 3200, now I’m using the Bitcoin I accumulated to margin to make more bitcoin through trading so I’m in gambling mode but the thing is, it was my job to do this professionally for many years with stocks so all of this is actually fun & exhilarating to me
77 2019-06-19 23:13:18 Tech stocks are hot! Until I see a sign of outward rotation, no point trying to pick bottoms elsewhere. Top 3 Tech stocks im watching based on price position on its daily/weekly: $ZS $ZM $TWLO
78 2019-06-19 23:13:11 Milk stocks at an all-time low.
79 2019-06-19 23:12:46 One could ask the same about mkt participants piling into SaaS stocks at 25x sales, HY & lev. loans in the 10th inning of the bull market.
80 2019-06-19 23:12:45 Maybe the masses have gotten smart. As stocks go up they become more risky not less risky.  Mean reversion is inevitable.
81 2019-06-19 23:11:06 Guys at the bar say stocks are up because of Trump. Perhaps they are into the market more than I assume.
82 2019-06-19 23:10:57 Shit he might be too strong he’s already taken everyone down to 8 stocks and he’s rocking steady at 10
83 2019-06-19 23:10:50 That’s fair. I respect that answer. For fantasy sakes, I hope Gurley is dominant. Although I’ll regret it because I’ve sold almost all my stocks

86 2019-06-19 23:07:50 Although that sounds interesting, I’d be real worried if someone told you you can only hold 30% of your assets in BTC, and the rest in stocks etc.

88 2019-06-19 23:03:22 There is more than one way to become wealthy - starting a business, investing in rental properties, investing in stocks, working in a high income profession for years, etc. - but there is a common trend among all people who become wealthy: they spend less than they earn.
89 2019-06-19 23:02:54 I’ve been going about this the wrong way, 

Fox Amiibo, Samus Amiibo, lvl 9 Fox and Ganondorf, ten stocks instead of three
90 2019-06-19 23:02:02 If and when stocks finish this up move it very much more likely Industrial commodity and USDJPY break. (and AUDJPY sub 75.00)

93 2019-06-19 22:59:28 Stocks are being held up by those that own stocks. If a art dealer owns 100 paintings by a certain artist, he always tries to buy every painting of that artist when they come to auction, at any price, to protect his inventory. Same w stocks
94 2019-06-19 22:59:25 Is it? Or are you talking the US again? Much more land is available globally for grazing than is suitable for growing crops.
95 2019-06-19 22:59:15 Wealth is actually a financial creation that’s what it is it’s an estimate of their stocks and holdings.  I may have stock that’s “worth” millions but if I don’t cash it out then it’s just an estimate of the market

99 2019-06-19 22:56:47 I'm with Caleb on this. Tried to short during recent retrace, BTC kindly handed my ass back to me.

When we recovered from a retrace after a broken parabola, I knew that a real bull market had started.

Keep doubting, rest of the world. Sold all my stocks and I'm all in.
100 2019-06-19 22:54:07 You assume only income/cap gains taxes, ignoring paying a wealth tax, which she has proposed. If you owe a wealth tax on stocks, you owe that regardless of a realization event, & either have to pay from your cash holdings, or have to liquidate something to get cash.

Your point is ?
106 2019-06-19 22:49:21 Out of all the things I learns over last 2 years, short turd and stocks that is under 200ma give you better risk/reward.  No matter how much you polish a turd, eventually the smell of it will be expose again 
107 2019-06-19 22:49:04 IMHO, it's far more likely that the existing financial system will collapse rather than Bitcoin.

Consider this: why would anybody elect to hold $ in stocks (that increase in value at a meager 7%) while Bitcoin is rising parabolically?

It's going to make 1929 look like a hiccup.
108 2019-06-19 22:49:02 Pride = stocks.  Why nationalism is
109 2019-06-19 22:49:00 I don't disagree that XLU down is bearish for stocks generally. However, inaccurate to say that XLU tops out months before the SPX at major tops. The 2000 and 2007 cycle tops for XLU were in Dec. 2000 and Dec. 2007. SPX tops were Sept 2000 and Oct. 2007.
110 2019-06-19 22:48:30 Funny as it might sound Jon but we run sheep to eat weeds, grain stubble, rest soil from cultivation, build up soil carbon, improve soil drainage & soil health and all the other good things that pastures do & crops don’t.
That you get to eat them is pretty much a fringe benefit

114 2019-06-19 22:45:09 Negus! Thts facts. If people knew what/who we are maybe they would start to take themselves more seriously and start moving with intention. Buying a chain isn’t the same level of success as buying 100 acres of land or property, or stocks. It’s a shift in mindset

119 2019-06-19 22:43:16 Market cap of crypto is not directly competing with fiat currencies. It's competing mostly with other investments like stocks , bonds , term deposits etc
120 2019-06-19 22:43:10 If I buy generic ground beef in a supermarket, what percentage of that comes from your farm, and what percentage comes from feedlots or the Amazon?

Is your beef cost-competitive with the market, or do you sell it at a substantial premium?
121 2019-06-19 22:42:40 It's okay if you're living paycheck to paycheck and don't have the money to put in stocks right now. Don't let the conversation on social media become discouraging. Save whatever and whenever you can. You can go to MVL with $3,000 and set up an account.
122 2019-06-19 22:41:52 It’s the way to do it. Diversification in a single asset class doesn’t work.

126 2019-06-19 22:39:04 "A China trade deal is priced into stocks."
"A Fed rate cut is priced into stocks."

Obviously, neither of these narratives were accurate... but you knew that.
127 2019-06-19 22:38:49 But how can you just put all the stocks in the world in one pie and say 41% pay out dividends, and second, so 59% lose money, where 52.8% is only needed to make money in a week/day/season/month/year.
128 2019-06-19 22:38:29 Ok. In the past when I’ve done it I would sell for a month or so out and then just let them expire. I would only do it on stocks I wanted to own and so would be ok if they had to be put to me. I never thought about doing it short term/day trade style
129 2019-06-19 22:38:01 Are we just going to keep predicting a rate cut until it actually happens? #investing #stocks #NEWS #bonds #invest #retirement
130 2019-06-19 22:36:36 Great buying point for their stocks too just saying ;)
131 2019-06-19 22:36:09 lolol... and they call us retail investors the "dumb money"... They said they were getting one today.. WRONG! and they'll be wrong again... and again.. you'll get 1 at best. #stocks #investing #NEWS #economy

136 2019-06-19 22:31:45 The Markets up for 2 weeks in a row per assumptions on 3 rates cuts, now no Cuts and another bullshit article about promise? The other time in history that this nonsense flies is in a bubble, real Economic fundamentals are detrimental to stocks. @jimcramer @Ufc26 @ParkerbBen

141 2019-06-19 22:29:51 It's all short term irrelevant noise when looking at the big picture bull market(idea from your book). Meanwhile, large cap stocks are doing very well. $dis, $jpm, $aapl, $pg, $mcd, $msft, $v, $hd, $jnj, $csco... just to mention a few...

143 2019-06-19 22:29:18 Futures are a lot more difficult than equities. Its a lot easier to learn how to trade on mid cap stocks. They move slower, less volatile.

146 2019-06-19 22:27:37 Animals are efficient in turning stuff we can't eat (grasses) into very nutritious stuff we can eat (them).

We would have to clear more land for growing crops if this happened which would have to be fertilised etc. Grazing animals is the better option.
147 2019-06-19 22:26:43 @wesbury Well...it seems the Fed is actually teeing up a rate cut for July.  We don’t think this is necessary, we don’t think it’s appropriate, but it certainly won’t hurt equities this year or next.  Still bullish on stocks! #FED $TLT $SPY
148 2019-06-19 22:25:53 What's your source for 67%? Animal feed is generally the crops that are considered not suitable for human sale or are the waste parts of plants that are not going to be used for human food (shells, husks etc).

175 2019-06-19 22:00:59 The only people really at risk are retail “buy and hold” investors since most of their portfolio is tech stocks plus index etfs and i doubt they’d pull their money or hedge these positions.

181 2019-06-19 21:58:47 If our education system was worth a damn it would be teaching children more fundamental lessons to prepare them for life. Teaching how to save, spend, invest (not talking about stocks), balance their budgets. Even in college they don't prepare students for the real world.
182 2019-06-19 21:58:31 Intellectually dishonest at best, fraudulent manipulation at worst (PPT). Amazing how the narrative flips so that stocks continue to rise for some reason or another. Anyone remember the whole "reflation" trade of 2017? It was all bollocks but stocks didn't give back the gains.

250 2019-06-19 21:13:12 So fear drives yields to negative territories(to meet safe heaven),but possible rate cuts, also adds to risk appetite when it comes to equities. We live in strange times my friends ....#stocks #equities #treasuries #dax #SPX
251 2019-06-19 21:12:41 I understand Jenny's logic. Recently, I've been doing the same thing. Great companies keep getting knocked off, creating short term opportunities. With political, international, and Fed nonsense, great stocks are unpredictable. Worst case, stuck with a great company at low value.

253 2019-06-19 21:10:43 $bioaq Have you ever seen someone argue that a steaming pile of crap was worthless, for over a year?! This is comical.  I could give you a list of 100 stocks where no one is posting.  Because they’re worthless.  It’ll be bittersweet when this comedy routine ends. Sigh.
254 2019-06-19 21:10:39 Respecto al salario real, era inevitable que cayera, puesto que parte de la mejora durante el kkismo se debió no a aumentos de productividad o mayor participación en la renta total, sino a fumarte stocks en la forma de infraestructura ydólar bajo p/importar y producir más barato.

262 2019-06-19 21:04:11 you sir are on another level. I held my stocks when I should have sold so went from +30 to -20 percent. I hope to at least break even on next run but lesson learned.

271 2019-06-19 20:56:30 My favourite part was where you mentioned you only learned tech stocks are volatile after you bought them. Most people would look into that before buying them. Not at GK!
272 2019-06-19 20:56:10 Deforestation? There's no need for it to make room for new herds. 66% of agricultural land cannot be used for anything rather than ruminant livestock. To this add the number of cows us following a declining trend for at least 40 ys. don't see how deforestation is plausible
273 2019-06-19 20:55:30 There's an entire generation of "investors" who haven't bothered to learn the first thing about markets. Why should they when central bank money-printing schemes mean stocks go up "forever"? They've never experienced a sustained drop and when it happens it will be epic
274 2019-06-19 20:54:33 But average people will drop gold just like they are dropping stocks
275 2019-06-19 20:54:01 So stocks are moving slightly higher today, because of a smorgasbord of shit that might, possibly, come together over the next two years?

278 2019-06-19 20:52:25 On Bernie’s idea for a single payer system specifically I disagree because it will ban all private medical insurance. The Health industry is 1/6 of our economy and health insurance employs the most Americans in the country, they also hold investments in real estate and stocks...
279 2019-06-19 20:52:19 World stocks ex Europe higher: US +.3%; Europe 0%. Markets liked FED indication that there could be a future cut. Won’t be enough to counteract China-US failure on trade but could lesson decline. Neither side wants failure but Trump will have to be realistic to avoid it.

371 2019-06-19 20:00:24 zone four, wall street we got plenty stocks
372 2019-06-19 19:59:49 They have an inflation target. Why talk about stocks and bonds?
373 2019-06-19 19:58:32 Stocks rose on Wednesday, bolstering their gains for the month, after the Federal Reserve opened the door for looser monetary policy in the near future. #StockMarketUpdate
374 2019-06-19 19:58:31 Your assumption is by cutting rates, that is going to give the economy the boosts it needs for companies to grow again. If lower rates is all we needed. European stocks should be going to the moon.
375 2019-06-19 19:57:43 That shit brazy I’m bouta just get more in depth in stocks and insider trading moe, that’s where all the money at
376 2019-06-19 19:57:40 Trump declares stock market an indicator of good times for Americans, guess what, “A whopping 84 percent of all stocks owned by Americans belong to the wealthiest 10 percent of households.” The market does not mean a good economy!
377 2019-06-19 19:57:19 This is how it works in a normal market. Market up on expectation of event, when that event does not meet market expectations it should sell off. But this doesn't apply to US stocks. Certainly didn't apply for the hundreds of points up on China trade deal but never gave back.
378 2019-06-19 19:56:59 So tempted to just call them and ask what's up.  All these large cross trades on multiple US cannabis stocks.
379 2019-06-19 19:56:49 $SPY Lot of garbage stocks flying up to high heaven - always a bad sign for the markets as selloff is coming here
380 2019-06-19 19:56:28 A news based stock may plumb to any depth ! Technicals generally fail in such stocks because either there is too much greed or too much fear in them.

That said it looks like it would touch 58 also.... next review after that.

And no need to call me Sir Bro...
381 2019-06-19 19:56:07 OR.... Stocks are higher because we are in a bull market?
382 2019-06-19 19:55:55 Don’t take his word for it. His father is a billionaire. Apart from stocks that would have been bought in his name, his assets (homes, luxury cars, jewelry) plus his liquid cash are way over a billion naira in value.
383 2019-06-19 19:55:36 Bring back the stocks. These scum need humiliating & to suffer the consequences of their actions. They need locking away indefinitely.
384 2019-06-19 19:55:29 So it’s thank a teacher today...I would personally like to thank my history teach Miss Stocks for her ongoing support, and always here for me whenever. And last but not least my English teacher Mrs Mapely for always pushing me to be the best I can be. 
385 2019-06-19 19:54:48 why... stocks breaking out....ride the flow
386 2019-06-19 19:54:44 Stocks are moving higher today b/c the Fed might cut rates 4 times in the next year b/c the economy is slowing & recessions are bullish but if the economy rebounds the Fed may not cut rates at all & stocks will move higher because the economy is growing & expansions are bullish.
387 2019-06-19 19:54:36 Too many stocks hitting 52-week highs...beware
388 2019-06-19 19:54:07 Trump claims all credit for low unemployment but, like growth in stocks, new job numbers on average, PER MONTH, were somewhat better under Obama. #TaxScam MAINLY helped billionaires and cuts in regs mainly help polluters and predatory lenders.

392 2019-06-19 19:51:01 There’s a lot to be concerned about. Stocks are booming. Jobs are booming. Military is growing along with the economy. I’m sure probably worried about prosecution if Trump gets a second term.
393 2019-06-19 19:50:48 stocks near all time highs and 10y almost under 2%.  sounds like a perfect time for ZIRP/QE.  why not
394 2019-06-19 19:50:30 I would spend £500,000 on moving to a bungalow, buy a new car and invest the rest in a bond or stocks & shares ISA.
395 2019-06-19 19:49:36 Dovish fed and 10yr yields fall and stocks rally. Please let’s stop the pretense that bond prices imply any information about economic activity. All they show is the massive excess in global liquidity.
396 2019-06-19 19:49:16 Having stocks is one thing but knowing what to do with your stocks is another thing. My stock market is growing better than I expected after just listening to people’s ups and downs about stocks and certain stocks.

402 2019-06-19 19:47:25 From murder of crows to a flamboyance of flamingos, so goes the vicious cycles of jr stocks from across all sectors, many exchanges inluding the likes of the lowest of low boards.  Some even rise from ashes over/a lot like phoenixes.  Take much care.  Learn something new daily.
403 2019-06-19 19:47:12 No, stocks have been rallying all of June on expectation of a superdovish Fed. There has been more buyers than sellers so its BS that people were positioned for a disappointment, the market trend says otherwise.
404 2019-06-19 19:46:22 I spent five hours there doing stock research. Visited Herbalife clubs (many), car yards (to see who their funders were and check they way they were giving credit), marijuana stocks (to check brand distribution), other sub-prime lenders (see car yards).

It is called research.
405 2019-06-19 19:46:16 My dad only ever texts me about stocks. He bought them for me as birthday gifts. The only thing I've ever done with them is cash them in to 1) buy a new laptop for work and 2) pay down the vet bills when my cat got very sick last year. Peak boomer, peak millennial?
406 2019-06-19 19:46:08 Traditional traded stocks, mainly invest in the biomedical world, new drugs or medical devices.. occasionally pot companies. Alt coins =trash, BSV is solid tech!
407 2019-06-19 19:45:19 Senator Corporate stocks are owned by Millions in our nation through 401 and pension funds. The increases have benefited millions of Americans.  Pretending otherwise shows your level of dishonesty.
408 2019-06-19 19:45:00 I'm afraid you have to have an opinion on this IN or OUT. You expected the public to vote on IN or OUT. This sitting on the fence approach from politicians has dragged this out and we have become laughing stocks. This is not a party political issue so stop making it one.

411 2019-06-19 19:43:45 One of the few out there who thinks both 1) stocks are over valued and should be, at a minimum, 10% lower, and 2) the Fed should already be cutting rates.

413 2019-06-19 19:43:10 I think it can be close to stage 2 or 3, but i'd say stage 2 due to the positive actions of the stocks i'm seeing. the action of leading stocks always supersedes everything else imo. If a growth stock breaks out on high volume after a nice basing period, I take the trade.

418 2019-06-19 19:41:24 No one talks about this.

But if the Fed can barely lower rates in the next recession, why can't US Stocks do a Nikkei for a decade or so?

Big drop and they just go sideways.

495 2019-06-19 19:14:12 @HalftimeReport Today's show was the best in a long time.  It was thoughtful, professional, well organized and people didn't talk over one another.  It touched on many interesting topics rather than just stocks already widely discussed in the news.
496 2019-06-19 19:13:59 It’s not only about short squeeze, it’s way more about getting institutional investors into Tesla -> they move stocks -> defeat FUD about perceived solvency -> create confidence for normal people that Tesla is a valid company with superior products. That’s what we want,don’t you?
497 2019-06-19 19:13:41 stocks rise by 1%.
498 2019-06-19 19:13:35 Interesting note here from @kevinolearytv: He mentioned that investing in cannabis stocks puts any investor at risk under RICO statutes. Important to remember that marijuana is a schedule 1 drug. #cannabis #cannabisstocks #investing #stocks

500 2019-06-19 19:13:30 Impoverishment and suffering is compounded by the effects of climate change - again, caused by US consumption - which is now destroying the subsistence crops/fish stocks/resources without which they cannot survive.
501 2019-06-19 19:13:18 Agreed.  It's kind of hard to get excited about this new website and sales when the financial are out of date, and it is listed as limited information on otcmarkets.  They had money for a PR (that no one seemed to read).  Website still says coming soon on homepage
502 2019-06-19 19:13:06 I’ve got a few hedges but more long than short.

Would love to know how many times Powell has said risk/s today and if much more than normal.

Bonds & stocks bid!

513 2019-06-19 19:08:31 #oott should the fed have cut today .. not sure why stocks are rallying
514 2019-06-19 19:08:24 3/3. It was lost by those buying in above $6. The value of $eros parts minus it’s debt, is well over 200 mil. It was driven below 200 mil by a short frenzy in the same way stocks go parabolic when longs go crazy. Bounce back imminent...
515 2019-06-19 19:08:08 Bonds are rallying, USD is lower, Gold is higher but Stocks can't catch a bid 
516 2019-06-19 19:07:55 I’ve started investing in stocks: beef, chicken, vegetable.... one day I hope to be a bouillonaire.
517 2019-06-19 19:07:33 just cleaning up the portfolio and buying in different stocks
518 2019-06-19 19:07:17 Stocks going to be at all time highs when the fed cuts.  Think about that
519 2019-06-19 19:06:58 Well...it seems the Fed is actually teeing up a rate cut for July.  We don’t think this is necessary, we don’t think it’s appropriate, but it certainly won’t hurt equities this year or next.  Still bullish on stocks!
520 2019-06-19 19:06:57 The current expectation for a rate cut at July meeting jumped to 100%
and that will be proven correct

And, there's still hope for a trade deal. 
Hope could prove better for stocks than actually getting a deal

525 2019-06-19 19:06:14 I feel prepatch oli mm was probably even but currently I feel it's too hard for to hit solid kills or combos just because of how zoning tools. Our ability to edgeguard oli is also so good and can lead to loss of stocks at pretty low percent especially now that his up got nerfed.
526 2019-06-19 19:06:07 Can't take the credit. Drunkenmiller made me have a rethink. Win if stocks fall..and win if fed policy is easy

539 2019-06-19 19:02:37 By Sept the stocks story may better support the cut they seem to want. By July earnings will just be beginning and not material yet. Worsening data by July and in September will support cuts. I'm beginning to warm to your crowding out thesis.  Not sure July offers enough for cut

546 2019-06-19 18:59:26 The problem with that is that Janet Yellin kept interest rates at practically zero for Obama and looking back further, Greenspan was quite accommodative to William Jefferson after his raise of the discount rate made stocks collapse.  Powell seems a bit lost.

551 2019-06-19 18:57:34 This Whataburger thing really isn't as big a deal as people are making it out to be. It's a change in who owns the biggest share of stocks and little else. I'll stand corrected if huge changes for the worse start happening but it's really not that big a deal.
552 2019-06-19 18:55:33 Really doing his best to not say the word "patient" but he has described it saying that they "need to look at more data". Stocks think this is dovish? I give up on equities, so moronic I just cannot comprehend

556 2019-06-19 18:54:54 which means if we dont get a cut stocks will fall hard ?
557 2019-06-19 18:53:44 Either of the two you know. SSL, Ideal, GKCM and some others allow discretionary (individual) buying. USD stocks are expensive though.
558 2019-06-19 18:53:33 Rates Unchanged = means "keep rates low" so bullish on stocks, bonds, RE, Gold, Bitcoin and bearish on the Dollar? :)

584 2019-06-19 18:45:40 Regardless of what the Fed says, there is one truth to the end of every economic cycle:

Wall Street will keep bidding up stocks until you lose 30-50% of your money and then claim they had no idea that was going to happen.
585 2019-06-19 18:45:37 Stocks cannot rise anymore in the US:

659 2019-06-19 18:24:39 Wow Kathryn, last night on Asian Streetsigns. , they were talking not til December.  I was thinking if they cut, I bet construction and the materials stocks an etfs will go up. Cheaper money to build homes, and renovate.
660 2019-06-19 18:24:25 I think they cut 50bps in September coinciding with the end of the rolloff. They cut in July only if things deteriorate further or stocks tank beforehand.
661 2019-06-19 18:24:21 Don't see how it matters. Stocks are insane.

666 2019-06-19 18:23:01 Its very frustrating. Two of three companies are at 0001. Whats stopping from the third one going the same way? Nothing is being done differently, but results expected are different. How can that happen? This has so much potential but dilution has killed all the stocks.

672 2019-06-19 18:21:27 But hardly a resounding rate cut cycle signal either - if anything underwhelming and bonds and stocks should be sold on the back of this

685 2019-06-19 18:16:14 That's why I'm in favor of a low leverage, diversified (FX, FI, stocks, commods, long/short) one-entry, one-exit + stop loss, systematic trend following approach - I might just survive chaos and crisis. Without that, it might not matter if I've ever managed through a crisis.

773 2019-06-19 17:46:16 1/ Today’s FOMC decision is one of the most critical in recent memory given its implications for markets across the board. Stocks, bonds, gold, Bitcoin, etc. all have a dog in this fight, but how it plays out in the near-term is anyone’s guess.  *insert "A thread below" here*
774 2019-06-19 17:45:54 How about raising the minimum raise to $15? Most people currently making minimum wage do not have stocks and investments. Stimulate the economy from the ground up. Instead of tax cuts for the 1% that never has the trickle down stimulus to the economy as sold!

787 2019-06-19 17:38:52 I don’t expect the #Fed to explicitly say rate cuts are coming but put rate hikes on hold. Market may not think this is good enough so a selloff in #bonds, #stocks likely this afternoon if I’m right. Macro numbers (and stock prices) are not weak enough to warrant guaranteed cuts
788 2019-06-19 17:38:27 How would that effect the indices & stocks, do you think?

794 2019-06-19 17:36:37 But stocks like ibull are not supposed to follow the market trend..many times it goes vice versa..though your stock selection paid well but I believe it can't be the part of pair trade
795 2019-06-19 17:36:31 It’s a ratio chart of High Beta ETF $SPHB vs Low VOL $USMV ETF  the consensus believes the chart rises which is right means high beta stocks should start to outperform low beta defensives. I agree and sentiment towards high beta is horrifically low so BTFD in high beta for now.

Is it feasible to invest thousands and lakhs of stocks to invest this way..just a question out of thoughts

890 2019-06-19 16:58:52 Qe is basically an asset swap from interest bearing reserve a/c to non-interest bearing reserve a/c at the BoE. It gave lots of liquidity to banks hoping that they would invest in private sector assets (they can't lend out reserves). So stocks and shares increased in value...
891 2019-06-19 16:58:08 Have made it a goal to learn something new everyday. Be it real estate, stocks, FOREX, doesn't matter.
892 2019-06-19 16:57:58 If I say I have invested and untoward happens!

Most stocks have invested I never know what may happen.

If I recommend on Twitter, all will coming running ..

Loss Loss Loss.

Maturity towards Investing is missing.

Failures are spoken very easily.

899 2019-06-19 16:55:42 Lol that’s the equivalent of me saying I know a guy who put all his money into penny stocks and now he’s broke! Point being saving money for money’s sake (or so you can retire at 63 instead of 65) isn’t necessarily the best way to have a happy life
900 2019-06-19 16:55:24 .@smartertrader if Powell cuts does @realDonaldTrump go harder on China negotiations knowing it won't hurt stocks as much?
901 2019-06-19 16:55:11 I would buy stock and then invest in more stocks to buy more stocks and then buy even more stocks
902 2019-06-19 16:55:01 Not my economy.  Gas prices up, food prices up, stocks lower, paid more in income taxes with same income as last year, after making adjustments. No more money in my paycheck.

909 2019-06-19 16:51:38  got you. I always see you talking about stocks. Was just curious my bad
910 2019-06-19 16:51:21 You bought a collection of the worst stocks available, bundled up pretty to keep you quietly employed and off the real markets.
911 2019-06-19 16:51:19 Stocks might fall if the Fed doesn’t guide for a rate cut like the Fed funds futures market projects.

The stock market wants a preemptive cut to help end this economic slowdown.
912 2019-06-19 16:51:15 Agreed but divvy stocks generally in unsexy sectors (Market Watch) Div stks, which have performed well this year, may get another boost if the Fed cuts rates.
Income-seeking invstrs could use div stks more than ever
913 2019-06-19 16:51:12 Careful today as you trade. FOMC event is due in less than 2 hrs and you need to plan your trades carefully. Volatility will also increase as we near the event. #forex #fomc #rates #fed #trading #forexsignals #stocks #interests #economy #fxtrader

915 2019-06-19 16:51:01 No. But they all habe the same financial interests and hold many of the same stocks.
916 2019-06-19 16:50:48 We'll have a team wandering around the area giving them out throughout the day, but if you want to, you can pop into the Acorn office to pick one up (while stocks last!)

Est ce que cette  polémique cache l’accord politique au PE?
919 2019-06-19 16:49:51 Decline in stocks is not a surprising event. It recurs. If you live in cold climate, you expect freezing temperatures and when it drops below zero you don't think of this as the beginning of the next ice age. You know summer will be warm again. Stocks do the same-- Peter Lynch
920 2019-06-19 16:49:26 Mike in Alberta:  $SOX  we don't follow it closely.  they haven't generated a lot of value for #shareholders.  Better names than Stuart Olson.  #stocks #investing
921 2019-06-19 16:49:19 Homes generally appreciate at a value of 3-5% annually. About the same as an average CD. Stock market averages 7-11% and crypto has been like 12% monthly or a factor of 3.2 a year. Too bad I was kinda late to coin and I lost a lot in stocks when the aluminum/steel war kicked off
922 2019-06-19 16:48:55 peach bair does all of that, but can float.  and other bairs like dk's are amazing for stringing off stage and getting early stocks.
923 2019-06-19 16:48:19 Some funda investors have more faith / knowledge about their stocks than the management / owners themselves. As a trader if a position goes against you massively , do we think we know more than markets or do we relook our analysis & accept that we are wrong and cut losses.
924 2019-06-19 16:47:55 @WHSmith are selling plastic bottled water (PBW) off cheap when you spend a certain amount. Why buy stocks of PBW in the first place when you’re a stationers? It seems to me to be so out of touch with #WarOnPlastics. We need PBW to be taxed; that would slow up sales. @HughFW
925 2019-06-19 16:47:38 If stocks are near record highs, what's the pretext for offering a rate cut?
926 2019-06-19 16:47:24 question about $DSG We like this company.  It's well run.  Getting into bigger acquisitions. You're gonna get your pull backs but it tends to bounce back over time. Pretty astute capital allocators.  #stocks
927 2019-06-19 16:47:21 #Gold is steady in $1345 range ahead of today’s decision. The #Fed expected to keep #rates unchanged, but Jerome Powell’s press conference should provide insight into #policy moving forward. #Stocks are up ahead of today’s #FOMC announcement, with the #Dow gaining 50 pts midday
928 2019-06-19 16:46:41 Great advice, and that is a lesson I am learning.
Very hard to trade futures, currencies, options, and direct stocks all at the same time.   Have narrowed my focus down to futures and need to further narrow to specializing in one or 2 of those markets/contracts.

933 2019-06-19 16:43:14 Lions... IF IF IF stocks fall after the Fed. decision, (just over an hour from now), exercise EXTREME CAUTION if you choose to short it.. WATCH crude, WATCH the 10yr yield. LISTEN to what Powell says at 2:30EST
934 2019-06-19 16:43:03 You can still have a weapon to defend yourself.  You just can’t have a military style assault weapon, bump stocks and high capacity clips.  Read his proposals. You have to have liability insurance for a car too.
935 2019-06-19 16:42:38 Yes i have implemented same in excel using vba/macro.

This macro helps to get huge oi Strick price details on nifty 50 stocks.
936 2019-06-19 16:42:35 I swore off investing in the oil space years ago. Too many macro factors and many current charts look awful with stocks just off lifetime lows. May take a look at refiners $VLO & $MPC as decent dividends & both look to maybe have bottomed. Thoughts 1 way or the other?
937 2019-06-19 16:41:27 There is lots of coffee ladies, although you'll not really be drinking that much I wouldn't have thought. It's my slightly stronger special blend - slightly stronger to me and Mr P time to prepare you for the games. There's a lot of you aren't there? Better check our rope stocks!
938 2019-06-19 16:41:23 Institutions move the market based on fundamentals. Traders trade as per direction of market. If midcaps/smallcaps are bleeding its becoz fundamentals may not be good for institutions to buy. Operators may operate on smaller stocks or illiquid stocks. They cant move the market.
939 2019-06-19 16:41:20 Question about $STN They recently sold the construction division. Some debt on the balance sheet. Not a bad name but we think there are better names than Stantec.  #stocks #investing
940 2019-06-19 16:40:49 The investigations would be over now if you hadn't obstructed justice. The news would not be so hard if you didn't feed them controversy. The economy would be better if you didn't impose tariffs and regularly sink stocks with your tweets. This is all on you.
941 2019-06-19 16:40:40 That 10% is what annoys me the most.I still have hope tho. My dad is very southern and believes the more items one has the more money one has so he spends unnecessarily, but he also owns property and stocks so I’m hoping that ppl are more educated than we think
942 2019-06-19 16:40:24 Let's not forget one of Warren Buffett's most famous adages regarding stocks and the $SPX on Fed day - "The first move is never the right move, unless it's up"

950 2019-06-19 16:38:02 When I played Ralphie last saturday there were like 2 stocks where I just knocked him off stage at like 40 and edgeguarded him to death with just up b. Working around d smash at the ledge and dodging lasers is the worst part of the matchup but i don't think that makes him harder
951 2019-06-19 16:36:45 Markets are reacting to President Trump’s tweet about meeting with the China President at the G20 for more talks on the trade. Just the mention of more talks had stocks moving higher at the open which pulled investors away from Bonds.
952 2019-06-19 16:36:30 I got an idea.

Gonna find a fellow stock market neophyte to do this stock thing.

Like we match funds per month (starting at 5k?) and invest in stocks and compare yields, notes & adventures on a Sunday evening while we read the  business pages of newspapers like 2 Warren Buffets
953 2019-06-19 16:35:57 Honestly, I’m new at this. Learning as it goes. I’ll wait for the call and take notes. I planned to only trade stocks for the first year, but tgod makes me experience the warrants. 
Thanks to them  
So I’ll wait and see ...

957 2019-06-19 16:35:06 I agree. Stocks that make quick upside moves like $BYND $HMNY $DRYS $TLRY etc. give new investors the illusion that the market is easy. Many get trapped chasing absurd valuations at the end of the hype and lose it all.

959 2019-06-19 16:34:46 Centrists are more than happy to let LGBTQ fight and die overseas if it means their 'defense' industry stocks go up.
960 2019-06-19 16:34:43 Stocks and indexes have different metronomes and mechanics.  Same can be said for different groups of stocks.  Price discovery has many faces. This is one of the key reasons to narrow ur focus in trading. Ur brain needs repetition in the same space to develop good instincts.
961 2019-06-19 16:34:28 @ScottWapnerCNBC There will NEVER be another "credit crisis" in our lifetime.  FED will go to negative rates before that happens and stocks will SOAR!!!
962 2019-06-19 16:33:10 ive been hawking $INKW all day. this has been an unreal run for long and flips. unreal. get get get it! #otc #otcmarkets #pennystocks #stocks
963 2019-06-19 16:32:14 Past Pick: $ATD UP 63%.  Well run company.  Great management team. Barely issued any #shares since 2009.  5 year annualized dividend growth is about 25%. Probably one of the few retail #stocks that are doing well in north america. 18x #earnings.
964 2019-06-19 16:31:27 Crypto in a bull market and Stocks in a crypto bear market? This might allow you to maximize opportunity cost in both scenarios.
965 2019-06-19 16:31:07 If anyone  can not identify small cap stocks then he should invest throuh index ETF/ small cap funds (direct plan) . 5 year absolute returns in small cap funds almost 100 % . e.g . HDFC small cap fund 5 year returns 102% . ज्यादा दिमाग लगाने वालों को बाजार पैसा नही देता ।

969 2019-06-19 16:30:25 "Our Economy"
Trump "boom" v Obama BOOM
GDP Growth: 2015: 2.9%, 2018: 2.9%
Real Wage Growth: 2015: 2%, 2018: 0.5%
Jobs: 2015: 2.71M, 2018: 2.57M

Trade Deficit: 2015: $500B, 2018: $620B
Stocks: 2015: 2%, 2018: -6%
Obama better as usual.
970 2019-06-19 16:29:38 Past Pick: $GC We like this company. #Revenues grew by about 35%.  Profitability slipped.  They are investing in the future. Optimizing gaming floors/increasing footage. 16x #earnings.  over 10 year long contracts. they have good partners.  #stockmarkets #stocks #investing
971 2019-06-19 16:28:28 Yesterday it was a posting on here regarding if someone would like your life stocks? I did answer for that. And then I received the message to contact you....

Also, the main “sink” for methane is hydroxyl oxidation.
974 2019-06-19 16:27:33 Past Picks:  $TCL - down 44%. They are transferring from a printing company to a packaging company. A bit of slippage in #revenues and margins.  But they've taken on a lot of #debt to do this. They spin off a lot of cash flows.  The valuation is about 5x forward earnings. #stocks
975 2019-06-19 16:27:18 This ain't you, chief.
976 2019-06-19 16:27:17 Lithium stocks more for trading and flipping now imho holding for longer-term could work if your time horizon is years. if someone wants quick “monster” gains, not likely unless u go with drill play, grassroots stories that are fresh new stories.

979 2019-06-19 16:26:42 Persons normally think its a either or situation between Unit Trusts and buying stocks individually but you can do both.

The percentage of funds u allocate to either is dependent on the risks u willing to take.
980 2019-06-19 16:25:53 i just be needing black peoples to talk to that do stocks i only know 2 niggas & we all just started basically together

984 2019-06-19 16:24:10 China’s working population is peaking now, and if Japan is any indication from ‘90s, Chinese stocks peaked about 5-10 years ahead it. The trade war probably accelerated a fragile situation...
985 2019-06-19 16:23:49 I've been holding off putting my weekly savings into my 401k and buying as much BTC as possible.  The stock market is so bloated right now.

990 2019-06-19 16:22:45 There’s so many stocks to venture into just a gamble and gotta have patience with it is all
991 2019-06-19 16:22:44 Le souci serait presque le même que pour les véhicules motorisés une fois les stocks de pièces de rechange épuisés : où trouver des pneus, chb à air, chaînes, cassettes... mine de rien même la mécanique "simple" demande un minimum de moyens de productions
992 2019-06-19 16:22:33 The price of unit trusts fluctuate up on down because it is an index of many stocks. Whilst if you just buy one stock if the company  does well you do well.
993 2019-06-19 16:22:29 A unit trust is a series of securities that may include stocks, bonds, fixed income managed by a fund manager. They pool money to invest. A stock is ownership or equity in a publicly listed business. You purchase it and benefit from price appreciation and dividends.
994 2019-06-19 16:22:07 Nina:  $PYR They haven't found their market niche. Their revenues have been stuck in a range of about 5-7M.  They have announced a $20M contract that is potentially pending. interesting company but not quite there yet.  #stocks #markets #investing
995 2019-06-19 16:21:59 I know the kpop community is young. There are some who seeks graphic designer's services for their fankits. I just have to say this, graphic designers, have to pay for a lot of things. Their laptops, the electricity bills, the membership/stocks items they paid for
996 2019-06-19 16:21:25 My plan to load up on stocks from bleach manufacturers before pitching it wide and partaking in the mountain of conflict of interest money is ruined.
997 2019-06-19 16:20:26 Sir, baring a handful of stocks, returns over the recent few years have come from PE expansion more than margin or sales expansion. The BOSCH picture that you've painted is symptomatic of most consumer stocks which are the ones holding up in this market.
998 2019-06-19 16:19:10 Anybody know anyways I can invest money more? Any information on stocks?
999 2019-06-19 16:18:56 Rory, is that sell stocks, or sell Bitcoin, or sell both?

1001 2019-06-19 16:18:50 Get into them cannabis stocks now. Then when it’s legal everywhere 
1002 2019-06-19 16:18:43 yeah but edgeguarding him’s free tbh. i think bayo’s killing problem is heavily overrated and it’s generally only on characters who DONT get edgeguarded hard. that’s why i find pikachus living to 250 where i can usually take stocks off snake around 120-150
1003 2019-06-19 16:18:42 It is time to be conservative and preserve to keep cash sometime. There majorly two choices 1. Stocks with high valuations 2. Stocks nearing junk as they slide everyday. cash if not handled properly becomes ash #investor #markets

1006 2019-06-19 16:18:12 If rate cut announced which stocks will be better to trade? Personally Nflx is good. Your thoughts?
1007 2019-06-19 16:18:11 Just to be clear, in the ‘greatest economy ever’ with record low unemployment, within 1% of stocks all-time highs and with interest rates only at 2%, we NEED a rate cut???  If that’s the case, just cut them to 0% and leave them there, I’m sure there won’t be any downside to that!
1008 2019-06-19 16:18:04 People say buy a lot of Gold, buy US stocks (after a 10-year bull run), short the Treasuries, etc, etc.

Firstly, this is just speculating. Secondly, this is not how long term wealth is made. It's easier when you're playing with monopoly money or just making "calls".
1009 2019-06-19 16:17:46 I’m trying to invest in liver stocks, with so many milenials drinking at young age by the time their 60 their going to need livers! It’ sounds like a long shot but I think it’s doable
1010 2019-06-19 16:16:43 Any more stocks which are on watchlist for shorting?
1011 2019-06-19 16:16:30 Doesn’t say don’t build a side hustle, just don’t let it distract you from getting promoted, raises, etc at day job since that will likely be the best source income.

Use money from your day job to pay off debt, build savings, and invest in stocks/RE so you’re not a “wage slave”.

1122 2019-06-19 15:29:55 "Those who can afford to invest in bonds get to collect annual interest payments; those who invest in stocks or real estate typically see their capital assets annually appreciate." 
Why there are still peoole who claim that @ThomasPiketty  is wrong I simply cannot understand.
1123 2019-06-19 15:29:53 why are people still buying jet airways or rcom?? we can see volume in both stocks when they are definitely going for bankruptcy
1124 2019-06-19 15:29:40 Nah small companies are harder. Big companies have tons of information and facts you can research. Small companies demand more research so like penny stocks are trash and risky

1129 2019-06-19 15:27:19 My friend got it from Fairprice online. They arent available in the physical stores. I heard some Korean marts around Singapore used to have as well though Im not sure if there are still stocks.
1130 2019-06-19 15:27:02 This is true. Investors remember Obama's bait & switch. Secondly, the big well run integrated companies are less impacted, the stocks reacting are the big players ones most dependent on oil price & market access, i.e. the most levered.

1136 2019-06-19 15:25:23 Hi Paul, what advice would you have for me, a Mexican borne Engineer, who migrated to USA by invitation of a High-Tech company, becoming US Citizen, and due to investing in Stocks and other instruments, I’m now retired in Mexico. What can I do to help poorer immigrants?
1137 2019-06-19 15:24:41 It varies actually. This week so far good 70%. Last 2 weeks  bad. So monthly bad. Last month was really good. overall I would say 60 %. I dont know how long you have been trading options, am doing this for over 8 years and stocks over 12 years.
1138 2019-06-19 15:24:36 The best business advice I have ever heard is that don't play the penny stocks.
1139 2019-06-19 15:23:52 You do options in index ox stocks as well
1140 2019-06-19 15:23:23 The only socialism I see is the handout to the 1% and the bailouts to farmers.
Out deficit has exploded, the trade deficit is much worse, farm bankruptcies are way up, home and car sales down, 2018 stocks ended in 10 yr low, border problem MUCH worse.
1141 2019-06-19 15:22:56 because they are fucking bought 

they don't call it "the corporate press" for no good reason 

the Mueller investigation on the other hand - that represents no threat at all to the upper 20% who are invested in Pharma stocks, so we hear plenty about the Mueller/Dem/GOP fight

1143 2019-06-19 15:22:32 My sister has lived in the states for the last 7 years.  Still has @HendoRelish shipped out to her.  Also who ever visits has to take at least one bottle to keep stocks running.
1144 2019-06-19 15:22:26 Rising stocks in face of currency debasement is equivalent of Zimbabwean worker putting his daily wage at end of day in a bottle of coke to save purchasing power.
1145 2019-06-19 15:22:15 this is not true of many stocks that create value. It is nonetheless  true of most non-utility tokens, as well as forex, futures, options, bitcoin and most tradable contracts/assets.

1150 2019-06-19 15:20:19 The day it appears the socialists are gaining traction is the day I dump my stocks. I'm not alone. Be careful who you support and fund corporate America. I'm already moving to defensive positions.
1151 2019-06-19 15:20:14 Keep your savings in stocks or real estate and you won't have to worry about currency fluctuations. The value of most companies will stay the same regardless of which currency it is denoted in, same with real estate. Speculate on currency futures at your own peril.

1156 2019-06-19 15:18:33 Supporting banning bump stocks or any accessory proves they no longer fight for the people
1157 2019-06-19 15:18:29 I agree that the cash market is crazy at this time (see my latest column Abby Normal). That's what leads me to believe some old-crop is going to be new-crop. Really screw with the Quarterly Stocks report.
1158 2019-06-19 15:18:03 "he's haunting the stocks, mate"
1159 2019-06-19 15:17:54 Trump and the republicans have banned "bump stocks". That is something the last administration failed to do.  

Banning bump stocks renders the AR-15 just like any other rifle where it shoots one bullet at a time.

Therefore your request to outlawing these weapons. is moot.

1167 2019-06-19 15:10:59 In their make-believe world they're unaware of becoming laughing stocks. Obviously, they aren't  joking.
Leaderships' talks and actions are so mediocre, appears disgruntled.
They are becoming Undesirable and  an Obliterating Lot.
Citizens are smart and they know who can deliver.
1168 2019-06-19 15:10:57 I agree that metals are the best hedge against a deflated dollar. I never heard of stocks being a hedge at all... That's what was confusing.

#Amazon stock lost 95% between Dec’99 and Oct’01 
#Netflix lost over 80% between July’11 and Sept’12

1174 2019-06-19 15:08:54 Everyone talks about stock diversification, and I agree, own more than one stock. However, if you have an idea that you've thoroughly researched, and a stock you are supremely confident about, every dollar spent on less confident ideas/stocks take away from your big $$ potential.

1181 2019-06-19 15:05:36 Sports betting and day trading are similar because both are zero sum games. Investing however is providing capital for the purposes of value creation.  That’s why stocks return 12% historically and all investors will generally profit.  The same is not true of sports betting.
1182 2019-06-19 15:05:14 The stock market is neither efficient nor random. It is not efficient because there are too many poorly conceived opinions; it is not random because strong investor emotions can create trends.

1262 2019-06-19 14:41:13 I'd wait until it gets a little bit higher, sell off. Wait for the crash. Then buy more when it's low, and wait for the rebound. It's what I do with stocks.
1263 2019-06-19 14:41:12 So, the level of stocks should dictate fed policy? Seems like this is, in principle, one if the things you’ve consistently railed AGAINST. Take a bogey. 
1264 2019-06-19 14:40:59 Nothing to worry. Piramal is a solid company. Stocks have their ups and downs. But depending on ur cost price, it may take a while for you to recover ur money
1265 2019-06-19 14:40:58 SALT certainly has a big impact. I also wonder if the huge December sell off in stocks weighed in since so many people wait until the end of the year.

1366 2019-06-19 14:10:26 Something I learned thru the years. (Decades.) Please don't surf too many websites. It will only confuse you. Best to study charts and fundamentals of past SUPER STOCKS and look for those traits in stocks today.  #stocks
1367 2019-06-19 14:09:21 What are you saying?  In terms of economics I see an WH that panicked in early May and through various intermediaries has tried to convince the markets that the decline in stocks was because of too high interest rates when in fact the problem has been created by WH policies.
1368 2019-06-19 14:09:20 True! Unfortunately there is no required certification or required educational hours to post TA/ Chart information related to Stocks and Cryptos. 

Also, I bet ONLY 2% actually have skin in the game and actually profit off their trading activity.
1369 2019-06-19 14:08:13 Well I think it’s a combination of things, the uncertainty of Brexit is affecting their GDP & stocks while American stocks are doing great because we have no laws to prohibit or curb stock buybacks lol there’s another recession coming in America soon
1370 2019-06-19 14:07:42 Can't blame them tho. The company had been hit by scandals after scandals. The future of the company remains unsure even their artist  since some of the scandals that hit them had a major effect on their stocks. But even though im not a YGE stan, i believe the company can recover

I recall seeing the "efficient frontier" curve of US/Int'l stocks in ~1991. Adding ~30% not only improved returns but reduced volatility. Is it possible that all those Int'l stock selling points are based on the bubble that hadn't burst yet?
1380 2019-06-19 14:03:41 with Facebook having the ability to monitor everyones conversations wouldnt this constitute the inevitability of insider trading in real time. An algorithm that detects key words and stocks in conversation then adjusting trades, sales and shorts. Seems shady AF

1420 2019-06-19 13:51:38 That's the problem with shorting those stocks.  You don't know when  the interest rate is going to effectively force you out.  I'd rather buy a deep in the money, long dated put when the interest rate is relatively low - At least you are locked in to that interest rate.

1471 2019-06-19 13:31:59 On days like this, look at the stocks which are just about 1-2 pc down or even in green than trying to average a stock which is down more than 5 pc. Whatever capital is left with you now, use it judiciously on ones which will generate returns than hope stories.

1480 2019-06-19 13:28:16 I dont track these stocks daily. Hardly 5-6% allocation of my entire portfolio here. Time will come for these stocks as well !!!
1481 2019-06-19 13:28:09 personally I trade the higher priced stocks as they are more predictable. But the swings are awesome if you don't have time to sit in the room. One example ARRY we got in at 16 and some change.
1482 2019-06-19 13:28:07 Dried hemp can be stored for years, with even more longevity in its extracted form. Crazy, I hope Wrld makes a ton from there hemp in Euro.
1483 2019-06-19 13:27:58 I've been trying out @BrainfmApp for focus music in the last couple of days..and it's damn good! Vibing sounds and it increases your #productivity a decent amount. (no, I don't have stocks)
1484 2019-06-19 13:27:44 Good morning investors! As you start to feel your way around those apps, it is important to build a few good habits. I recommend watching Squawk on the Street every morning and pick 3 stocks you are interested in and check them at market open and close Monday through Friday.
1485 2019-06-19 13:27:19 Stocks from the SMB Scanner: $AXTA $KURA $BHVN $RIO $ALDR $GPRE $LZB $WGO
1486 2019-06-19 13:26:36 What looks like Panic on a 5 min. chart is nothing on a day chart. #stocks
1487 2019-06-19 13:26:26 it is still a lot of work to look at micro stocks. you see a big percent move.. then you investigate the news the charts etc. versus the indexes where it is typically just news
1488 2019-06-19 13:26:07 USD & Stocks may move a lot when DJI starts 22:30 (JST = GMT+9h)
1489 2019-06-19 13:25:26 Some stocks on watch:

$SLS $VBIV $CALA $LGCY $SESN
1490 2019-06-19 13:25:18 •Remote flexibility
•Above market base + bonuses
•Career advancement opps
•401k + match (extra points if retirement funds provider allows us to pick our own stocks)
•Unlimited PTO/Vacation
•Monthly health/wellness budget
•Monthly office supplies budget

In that order 
1491 2019-06-19 13:25:13 SG wants to grow the sector by 50% in the next 10 years. IMO a short term view because welfare, the environment and the irreparable damage to wild fish stocks are all being made secondary issues - issues that will kill the industry in the long run. It’ll be too late by then.
1492 2019-06-19 13:25:05 NEW STOCKS NEXT WEEK!
1493 2019-06-19 13:24:10 European stocks edged down and U.S. stock futures were mostly flat on Wednesday as investors avoided big bets ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s highly anticipated interest-rate decision later in the day.

1494 2019-06-19 13:23:25 @SquawkStreet when the hell did this neurotic cramer become a political expert? Bad enough his stocks picks stink(he s been quiet on his 3 week attack on BYND) . HE blocks carl and dave from speaking forcing his dribble out nonstop.
1495 2019-06-19 13:23:07 @narendramodi @FinMinIndia  Health, Education, Irrigation, Water literacy and conservation, afforestation, Farmers' livelihood and security... These should be the pillars of the budget.
1496 2019-06-19 13:22:53 Hi! Thank you for your comment  I'll be opening my shop with Keychains, stickers, charms , prints and of course the cushion cases! The stocks might be limited however due to an upcoming convention I'm preparing for!
1497 2019-06-19 13:21:43 If there is no deal with China stocks get hit bigtime. Business will crumble.
1498 2019-06-19 13:21:28 Nice John! Let me know if you need help with anything when you’re here/ have time to chat stocks LOL 
1499 2019-06-19 13:19:25 what about 524 stocks hitting 52 week low, broader markets are doing horribly bad

1504 2019-06-19 13:18:24 No idea but a 10c SP would have been nice.
I could have made a lot more money if I bailed in Jan-Mar 18.
I held on too long too but had other assets to buy during the year forcing myself to sell down many stocks.
You need to contextualise when I started commenting on $AVL.
1505 2019-06-19 13:18:17 Keep grinding mate I'll be playing tomorrow to take on stocks and jhr
1506 2019-06-19 13:18:11 Yep, just getting rid of the leverage from stocks and using that cash to invest in long dated Treasuries via $TMF $ZROZ

Already long 2-Yr Treasury futures too.

My equity hedges will keep me flat and hopefully these positions will appreciate during any slowdown/recession.
1507 2019-06-19 13:18:10 #Goldspider points out that there is a huge gap between rising #palladium prices and Producer stocks.

The market hasn't priced in the increase in profit margin.

Do your homework and find stocks that have good exposure because we could see the metal make new highs.

1511 2019-06-19 13:15:59 Yes nasdaq IPO. It is what matters re US stocks
1512 2019-06-19 13:15:42  why don't you read them, they do exists in great numbers
just like with any medicine, it's the dosage and anyway, nobody has money to eat 300mg of epidiolex a day, so don't sweat it ;) it would be less expensive if you bought stocks in GW Pharma and be paid in products :)
1513 2019-06-19 13:15:38 I actually think bo is an alternative investment spoiler! Probably working for the same peeps who RIG the gol/silver and push stocks!
1514 2019-06-19 13:14:44 Its better to keep it idle unless you know the business in detail. Have position in 1-2 stocks & that too in pain. Lets see !

1516 2019-06-19 13:14:18 There is an aberration on CT regarding XRP. People seem angry that announcements for Ripple/XRP do not make the $ of XRP go up. The SAME people are fighting on CT that XRP is not a sec. XRP will go up with utility. Stocks (securities) go up or down based on news. XRP = utility.

1521 2019-06-19 13:13:11 In the long term, the market weighs stocks for their price... over the short-term it’s a voting process.
1522 2019-06-19 13:12:44 Stocks and global prospects could head south  of the markets see too many downturns from the European divorce.

1524 2019-06-19 13:10:13 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
1525 2019-06-19 13:09:54 Penny for your stocks... 
1526 2019-06-19 13:09:54 What's overvalued mean. The best stocks are overvalued stocks that stay overvalued. AMZN was overvalued for 20 years.
1527 2019-06-19 13:08:54 Watch your bit coin stocks 
1528 2019-06-19 13:07:01 imf has its own terms&conditions of giving money to someone,they don’t do it for free

1529 2019-06-19 13:05:55 Why should we believe a word you say? Every time you talk you lie. We’re headed for a trade war recession because of Trump’s lies and arrogance. Sell stocks before the crash. #ImpeachTrump
1530 2019-06-19 13:05:08 I want the Fed to unexpectedly cut and then stocks fall in response.
1531 2019-06-19 13:04:36 I never see the HRITHIK stocks on your list. Did you conciously eliminate them knowing they won't fall or the algo didn't trigger shorts in those Scrips?
1532 2019-06-19 13:04:27 @Amul_Coop we r retailer named prabhu kripa In kanpyr,gst no is 09ab hot9760h1z0. we r struggling For stocks and damage ice cream, no body cares, assist pl @MOFPI_GOI
1533 2019-06-19 13:03:54 And Non ESG stocks with loads of debt tanked 5 to 15%!
1534 2019-06-19 13:02:44 It won't be diff but your conclusion is right - nothing matters on a fed save and stocks do not belong lower. Most inv today are new to mrkts (since 2011, most since 2106) and have no ideas. They will learn. it'll be painful, For now logs, idiots & chart chasers still in charge
1535 2019-06-19 13:02:37 Another reason I invested in $cweb instead of pot stocks

1538 2019-06-19 13:00:02 Now that the time stated by you has almost elapsed and there’s panic all around do you think we are nearing the bottom ? Would also be thankful that f you could list a few stocks that can be bought for long term.
1539 2019-06-19 12:59:39 Excellent Ronak bhai ; please post how you pick stocks for intraday trade;thanks very much

1546 2019-06-19 12:57:37 OKAY BUT PHARMACY, That's a lucrative industry. I'm invested and want stocks.

1560 2019-06-19 12:54:20 I agree with that. It's lower for longer - a lot longer.  Dividend stocks will continue to be relatively cheap (compared to govies) yet absolutely expensive!
1561 2019-06-19 12:54:20 Time to take comfort in your favourite Warren Buffett quotes if you are a midcap/smallcap investor

1568 2019-06-19 12:52:35 I like to hear what you have to say about those stocks.
1569 2019-06-19 12:51:58 Spreads between growth and value are at extreme levels on some metrics, though on an absolute basis, value stocks look to be trading at historical average levels.

1578 2019-06-19 12:46:22 Totally. That's why your upside is limited with stocks: you have to build up your portfolio over years while still paying rent for the place you live in. But you can adjust the amount you invest. With mortgage, you pay, every month, forever… Welcome to the club @pepibumur! 
1579 2019-06-19 12:45:13 I buy a set of stocks worth 15k every month. It's an equity SIP that my broker suggested. The investment has already come in handy once.

1581 2019-06-19 12:44:48 Dotcom stocks did pretty well at one time too. If you think it will continue to outperform inflation and other assets, they by all means speculate in it. My original point was that it is only an asset and has no liability and no redemption value and therefore isn't "money."

1603 2019-06-19 12:36:26 One benefit of investing in property: you're doing it with somebody else's money. (aka leverage) with very very low interest rates: ~1% currently. Impossible to get loans for stocks at comparable rates.

The Fed is expected to leave rates unchanged at the end of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, but expectations are high that the central bank could reduce borrowing costs later this year. The Fed's statement and new…

1612 2019-06-19 12:31:39 Do I actually see movement in the steel stocks? Apparently $X idling 3 blast furnaces may be helping to alleviate oversupply concerns.  Keep an eye on $NUE and $STLD this morning.
1613 2019-06-19 12:31:16 Stocks & Bonds will literally save your life, if no one ever told you to invest your money in that. INVEST IN IT. Equal opportunity exist, equal education doesn’t. Educate yourselves! Learn finance and business!
1614 2019-06-19 12:30:38 Really enjoyed this one, thanks guys.

Took the Vanguard questionnaire. They told me to do 30% bonds and 70% stocks. Laughed to myself quietly. Stacked more sats.

1628 2019-06-19 12:24:20 There is a very simple answer to that question. The people up top benefit from the results. Every few years of FB's history is punctuated with further involvement in atrocity, sometimes with total admission -- and zero repercussions. Their stocks fall -- and bounce back higher.
1629 2019-06-19 12:23:43 I hate that word teaching. We were just discussing stocks as two friends. Glad you got something out of the big picture and not scared off over the concept it represents. Have a great day kid!

1654 2019-06-19 12:06:40 D.C. handed the keys to the economy to fed long ago for that reason, so they would not have to decide to anger constituents or get blamed. This may never change. Results for 10 years is convincing - stocks got rewarded, the economy is worst recovery ever for most debt ever.

1660 2019-06-19 12:05:08 When is for a jyotish /astrologers to answer...

I can only guide... about what you should do.

When is for you to decide... 

Stocks reverse only when there is more demand and less supply.. if this helps..use it or I can only give you regrets and regards from my end... 
1661 2019-06-19 12:05:00 Good question. My bet is that stocks get crushed and 5-7 year rates actually fall on lower inflation expectations. Could be chaos though.
1662 2019-06-19 12:04:05 Can we just skip to the part when central banks own all stocks, the top 1% own all land, and MMT governments print guaranteed incomes for the rest so they can play Fortnite 35 while AI bots drone deliver burgers and toys to their 3D printed homes?
1663 2019-06-19 12:03:47 Look at his "profession." He's one who's benefiting from the tax scam, deregulation of financial institutions, and Trump-created movement on specific stocks. Just one of the band of GOP crooks and liars who have a strangle-hold on our beautiful country.

1701 2019-06-19 11:45:58 We’ve certainly had a volatile couple of years. And we’ll likely remain volatile for awhile. And I can see how it’s easy to think the mkts are overbought.

2) they should not allow day trades on quite a few stocks
1831 2019-06-19 10:17:41 Ouais pour le moment ils se concentrent sur le Hellfest, ils y vendent des sérigraphies de l'année passée aussi, donc pour pas fausser les stocks ça m'étonnerait pas qu'ils shut down le site.
Mais ça reviendra après sans soucis, t'inquiète et garde le site en favoris! haha

1834 2019-06-19 10:15:03 ECB President Mario Draghi, speaking at a central bank event, emphasized the bank's readiness to add stimulus if the economic outlook doesn't improve. Global stocks and bonds rallied and yields fell in response, with markets betting that increasingly supportive monetary policy.
1835 2019-06-19 10:14:59 And one more thing I will give index calls only because I am an always an index trader if do stocks also my concentration towards #marketprofile and #orderflow will shed that is why I don't do those things I want to be clear in what I am doing then my calls also will be clear.

1840 2019-06-19 10:11:02 Sorry but I don't recommend stocks.
Right now I think producing mines are most interesting as finance will be tough for new mines. High quality, low cost and good customer base seems the best option but nothing certain in the current market. New resources need to be digested

1867 2019-06-19 09:58:02 I am tired of telling people that don't invest in these stocks, these stocks are wealth destructor, if you have money that doesn't mean you have to invest? There is bank fd too, if you can not understand market then don't take risk.

1870 2019-06-19 09:53:19 My point here is that most investors have some exposure to stocks, which gold can reduce in times of uncertainty.

The price of Bitcoin thus far is completely unpredictable and although its bounced back how many HODLRs do we still have at 12k, 13k, 15k etc?

1872 2019-06-19 09:52:56 Stocks rallied on word President Trump will meet with China's president at the G-20 summit later this month. The Dow jumped 353-points, Nasdaq climbed 108 and the S-and-P rose 28 points. Trump described a "very good phone conversation" with President Xi easing investor concerns.
1873 2019-06-19 09:52:32 discount sale going on, on many good stocks right now!
1874 2019-06-19 09:51:54 No... Powell will jawbone a willingness to adjust interest rate policy that suits incoming data... blah blah blah... and stocks will pull back giving the FED a reason to cut in July. Maybe 50 basis points. More importantly, how will PMs react?
1875 2019-06-19 09:51:29 Indeed.

But it's simply buying stocks (> 10K $) at the Western Exchanges that makes all politicians corrupt and obeying Billionaires demands for control.

What do you think?
1879 2019-06-19 09:41:47 The fact that stocks go up at the mere hope of an end to the tariffs shows how dependent America is on Chinese goods. Trump's whole populist war is utterly ridiculous. Where does he think his cell-phone comes from?
1880 2019-06-19 09:40:44 Perhaps a read of the book Empty Planet by Darrell Bricker and John Ibbitson will result in some sobering of this rather worrying scenario.

That said, India definitely needs to better manage the population..
1881 2019-06-19 09:40:41 Hmm I don't think a cut today,QT will stop earlier than September that's to prepare the markets for a cut,there growth forecast for 2nd Q is still 2.1% and stocks are a bit to high..
1882 2019-06-19 09:40:33 No it’s definitely NOT ok. The perpetrators of this kind of refuse disposal should be taught the error of their ways by a week in the stocks. Our village elders come down hard on that type of thing and don’t get me started on dog excretia...

1894 2019-06-19 09:31:15 The process is tested in this type of markets by:
1. Not holding any Stocks which are been crashed crazily,
2. Not having any lust to do bottom fishing in any crashed stocks.

1907 2019-06-19 09:23:46 Lot to unpack. 1/ Happy to bankroll the stock market punters too? RE a PE of 35 plus nose bleed for a stock. At least stocks are productive investment unlike established. The most effective, 95% plus union has unacceptable working conditions and unrelenting slander from Lachlan.
1908 2019-06-19 09:23:40 Or for such non secular type of stocks , one should sell some when the cycle is down and buy back on recovery ? But how does one identify the cycle ? Or is one better off investing in non cyclical stocks ?

1910 2019-06-19 09:22:32 Liquide les stocks
1911 2019-06-19 09:21:44 The reason for asking this is such stocks have sharp drawdowns in stock prices compared to secular industry stocks like paints etc
1912 2019-06-19 09:21:02 Scrap the vagrancy act, and substitute it with a "Sneering Tory act" Which means that anyone of limited means who votes Tory be placed in stocks for an indeterminate period!
1913 2019-06-19 09:20:30 Agree but then your exit should be based on technical indicator like break of 200 DMA. But some folks will argue stocks like MRF have lost 90% of value before becoming multibaggers

1948 2019-06-19 09:05:08 Asian stocks posted strong gains on Wednesday after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi opened the door to more monetary stimulus and U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans for an "extended" meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the Group of 20 summit in Japan.
1949 2019-06-19 09:04:46 @_anujsinghal ADAG stocks RelCap & RelInfra are whale & sole bread for their side income. Ask NSE/BSE members off camera & they will tell you.
1950 2019-06-19 09:04:15 Gwr had 40 year old stocks needed replacement. XC have 16 years old fleets. For failing Govt, funding was given to gwr to replace them. What govt could’ve done give them the hsts for comfort. That would be sensible. When did our govt do something sensible?
1951 2019-06-19 09:04:14 Hating stocks at 11700 nifty?! 
1952 2019-06-19 09:03:35 Looks like @BJP4India wants to wind up every small & midcaps firms look at carnage going on and government is just ignoring it, every sector is bleeding only index management through handful stocks.
1953 2019-06-19 09:03:25 This world is full of demons, stocks and bonds and bible traders. So I do the deed, get up and leave. A climber and a sadist, yeah

1957 2019-06-19 09:00:26 I am not eligible to give such specific advice.
You can easily find if you work hard - as several stocks have that potential

Don't have knowledge on sugar sector. I look at commodities only when they are at multi-year lows

1960 2019-06-19 08:59:16 Correct...but we get one or two stocks to short daily n make money...that's also great 
1961 2019-06-19 08:57:59 Yeah I’ve been do stocks and shares for 15 years but fi two months and it’s a lot more enjoyable  yeah I’d like to give spread betting a go

1964 2019-06-19 08:56:22 Stocks and shares. I like the idea of spread betting but it seems scary at the same time
1965 2019-06-19 08:56:11 @DerZuschauer7 Recvd a lot of queries this week to chk charts from many friends who are just investors, not active mkt participants. Most of those stocks were hitting 52 week and in a few cases multi yr lows. Makes me wonder how the hell is the index at 11700, 
1966 2019-06-19 08:55:52 Sir why so cynical? Please do invest in good quality stocks. You will make money in the long term :)

1971 2019-06-19 08:52:32 But with no risk,  can I at least keep money at same level? 

For eg,  Banks have NPA issues and insurance is only Rs 1 lakh. 

Shares,  Stocks,  Gold,  NCDs have market and credit risk. 

Govt securities have interest rate risk. 

So pensionees just wait to die penniless?
1972 2019-06-19 08:52:14 Today

IBHF is at 1/2 of its 52 week high.
Yes Bank is at 1/4th of its 52week high.

1977 2019-06-19 08:48:56 I learn from not putting all my money down In believing  it’s potentials in this volatility market. I think prices of crypto is more controlled than before.

1980 2019-06-19 08:48:11 Interesting from BOAML Fund manager survey.. Government bonds are now the ‘most crowded’ market trade, more popular than technology stocks- U.S. government bonds, cited by 27% of respondents, pushed the long-popular technology trade out of first place.
1981 2019-06-19 08:48:01 I think you could be right, it's so hard deciding which stocks go dead and which continue to spike, 4.2p premium just paid and I know from the past what this stock can do, cannot win them all #n4p
1982 2019-06-19 08:47:41 I wish the fans world wide can do this and also not buy the jerseys and ticket. The club should feel what the fans are feeling financially fall in stocks. I’d be so happy .

1984 2019-06-19 08:46:45 It’s said that one’s loss is another’s gain. But does not apply to aviation stocks. Exactly 2 months back Jet (19 Apr) flew its last flight. But gain in last 2 months in share price of Interglobe is 5% while Spicejet down 2%. Jet  down by 82%. Overall market cap of aviation down!

2000 2019-06-19 08:37:33 Lessons learnt from messages received:

1. People don't have clear views on why they held stocks in portfolio

2. People don't like to sell stocks even after things are clear . Ex. DHFL, Yes bank, Jet airways

3. People worry more about stock prices fall than business failures

2003 2019-06-19 08:34:22 USD/JPY remains rather disappointingly weak as stocks rally and intraday bias remains down. Consolidation from 107.81 could extend but upside should be limited by 109.02 support turned resistance to bring fall resumption.

2009 2019-06-19 08:30:28 Stocks are up but USDJPY struggled. We have been on this 108-handle since June 10. So this FOMC could be the trigger to get us out. Markets clearly waiting to see what message Powell wants to send re policy moves. A cut in July is fully priced..

2018 2019-06-19 08:24:15 When you buy stocks you always lose the difference between bid and ask, also called spread. That's why you see a lost in your portfolio right after buying the stocks. Check out our video tutorials.
2019 2019-06-19 08:23:28 Sir but for a stock like this one has to have done very detailed research and spoken to the ARC/management to see how value would unlock. Such stocks could be value traps unless you have specific insight.

2029 2019-06-19 08:18:18 You'd think the YG stocks would have gone down after the articles we read today about Hanbin/YG and Seungri. Yet they're up by 2.47%

2034 2019-06-19 08:11:45 Company performance matters the most.
Look at quarterly results, annual audit reports, consistency in performing, etc.

There are some stocks which have made investors rich such as Bajaj finance, TCS, Britannia, HDFC bank, HDFC, RIL, L & T, Infosys, etc. (Consider divided also).
2035 2019-06-19 08:09:03 Correct. Never go against the central banks as they now control the stock markets since 2009. Their game is the only way now if you want to be involved in stocks.  There’s a time to take on the contrarian trade and we will be there very soon after these rate cuts.
2036 2019-06-19 08:07:58 If a stock falls 5 % , it doesn't mean there is something wrong with it. In an open market , by nature , stocks will fall and rise.

2038 2019-06-19 08:06:50 I feel that Trump’s gonna win again because Dems can’t focus right now.  Biden will face as much backlash as Hillary did and middle america won’t give a shit about Trumps heinous shit or idiotic tweets as long as stocks are good.  I really hope I’m wrong on this though.
2039 2019-06-19 08:06:25 Wasn't so long ago that people in the stocks had tomatoes thrown at them, can't recall anyone being arested for doing so.

2076 2019-06-19 07:33:21 The effect of Stockviews and The Analyst notes are quite something - Accesso, Victoria, LTG all suffered hugely over last year. We have to watch stocks with seeminly unstoppable momentum and chunky valuations very closely

2080 2019-06-19 07:31:43 SA economy has been growing much slower than the global economy. It’s  unlikely for SA inc. stocks to outperform the SA economy. Look for value in offshore companies that operate globally. Invest in hard currency.

2093 2019-06-19 07:20:18 Stocks can’t be at ath when we are on the verge of a recession so either we’re not in a recession and hence rate cut doesn’t make sense or stocks don’t deserve to be so high.
2094 2019-06-19 07:20:02 @CNBCTV18News my sense equity markets is trying to segregate good vs bad stocks , eliminating high leverage stocks and even it should be selling due to margin calls . It’s purely eliminating the bad governance stocks versus the fair or good ones

2099 2019-06-19 07:17:22 I am not so sure. Denmark 20 year pays 1 basis point. Money in europe has no place to go to get a yield. Its forced into USD,s and Stock markets. I think any pullback could well be bought. Unless of course we enter earnings recession. 

Stocks are cheap in this crazy world

2108 2019-06-19 07:11:29 Expert Advice- Nifty witnessed sideways move in the last session but managed to sustain below the important support of 11770 levels. The trend continues to stay negative and it is advised to use sell on rallies until important resistance is taken out!

There are some good things he's done but his entire time so far is about pumping stocks on a fake narrative. He assaults the fed for not doing more of what he assulted them for as a candidate.

2119 2019-06-19 07:05:38 #QT has continued despite #Powell clarifying "QT autopilot" policy in January. Stocks rallied.

Why would the #FOMC take the political risk to cut rates today?

QT is deflationary, so the Fed's use of Phillips Curve predicts rates remain unchanged in June.

2151 2019-06-19 06:50:26 In 78, market didn't fall immediately but note it was at the same level 4 years later. In 89 episode, the market declined by 20% in '90 and again, it was at the same level as the time of the inversion.

Rate cuts does not necessarily means high price for gold as imvestors would take more risk and try to get greater returns

2192 2019-06-19 06:22:11 Stocks may see a boost post-FOMC, as long as the committee shows it’s open to rates markets being correct on the policy path.

2213 2019-06-19 06:07:03 Tim, the devil is in the detail. That’s a return on investment of 8.7%. It is not so out of the world. I don’t see anything special in buying stocks in 2007 at $499 only to earn $5700 in 2019 (12 years later). Low return! Not out of this world.

2415 2019-06-19 03:57:04 Are guillotines legal? Are there rapid-action guillotines, are there guillotine bump stocks? Does my state permit the open carrying of guillotines
2416 2019-06-19 03:54:44 Selling trade flow to funds. 

Marking up stocks and giving poor executions. 

When you have a lot of clients scalping them can be worth it.

2419 2019-06-19 03:53:09 At the same time, stock price of a bad company can appreciate by 50%. 
If this makes us run after bad stocks, we need to review our approach.
2420 2019-06-19 03:52:18 Stock price of even a good company can correct by 50%. If this distress you, you ought not to own stocks.

2423 2019-06-19 03:50:11 That's true. $RIG has the most scale & earnings leverage when utilization & day rates eventually rebound. Nobody believes that will happen anytime soon, which is why these stocks are trading near the low end of the ranges...we are willing to take a longer-term view & be patient.
2424 2019-06-19 03:49:01 Stock price of even a good company can correct by 50%. If this distress you, you ought not to own stocks.

2429 2019-06-19 03:43:50 Alex Jones deserves to lose every penny he has. And then be set in stocks in Newtown and pelted with rotten fruit by passing citizens.
2430 2019-06-19 03:43:45 Regulators/exchanges should bring more stocks into futures list over time.

Mkts can help the regulators and retail investors in flagging concerns on "poor"companies/mgmts via future prices 

If no futures, mkts have less avenues to flag these concerns, hurting retail investors

2436 2019-06-19 03:41:54 They have stocks and savings. They have partner who's earning enough. They can pull through. They have parents to leave the kids with and go on "sabbatical". They have probably paid off their student debt. And they'll get a new job soon. They know people.

2441 2019-06-19 03:39:20 This is probably the opposite of timeliness, but I’d love to see the @ReformedBroker post about setting ridiculously low prices for stocks you would want to own. Love the concept.

Be-careful while picking stocks........High debt companies still a big problem for investors/traders.

2457 2019-06-19 03:31:34 It’s hard to make sense of it. The crowd cheered wildly when Trump bragged the stock market went up today. What do you think the size of their average stock portfolio is?  What percentage of them own any stocks at all? Half the people standing behind him looked like meth heads.
2458 2019-06-19 03:31:26 how do you scan for stocks you will be playing each day?
2459 2019-06-19 03:30:44 After two days of relative underperformance,  one CAN expect metal stocks to do well today following optimism around trade talks with meeting between President Trump and President Xi likely on the sidelines of G-20 summit.

2477 2019-06-19 03:25:10 Quoting the index PE and saying the market is expensive is a way to fool retail investors!

Small and mid caps have never been so cheap over the past 5 years!

In fact in India the it is a momentum index they include the stocks that go up and throw out the stocks that go down!
2478 2019-06-19 03:25:04 The Vegas shooter tossed a coin....knives or ARs with bump stocks

2481 2019-06-19 03:22:38 Long term investment:-

Look at what happened to sintex, Jain irrigation, ADAG stocks, Yes bank, DHFL, Jet airways, etc.

In the past also, few script such as suzlon, unitech, J P associate, Punj lloyd, etc.

Do u still believe in holding stocks for years? Wanna be Warren buffet?

2484 2019-06-19 03:21:05 Just what the markets needed - a dovish ECB to send stocks higher. ECB went full retard in another attempt to stimulate the EU zone economy just as all major indicators were flashing red. This include expanding QE and cutting interest rate deeper.

2491 2019-06-19 03:18:07 The @Ripple partnership  and the use of #XRP pushed @MoneyGram stocks up +167% in just one trading day and pushed @WesternUnion stocks down -2.4% for that same day.
 I am sure Mr. Hikmet Ersek the @WesternUnionCEO of @WesternUnion is not  going to be so happy about that. 
2492 2019-06-19 03:17:47 Why retail investors are preferring small & micro cap stocks?
Majority thinking for low price & getting more quantity,quick gain!!
How many companies Sustain growth in this space? Only few!!
Operators also like this types of stocks bcz of easy to manipulate!!

2550 2019-06-19 02:33:55 I’m already over Trump because he didn’t keep his “campaign promise” of #BuildTheWall #DeportThemAll and illegals are coming in the largest numbers ever. That was my main reason for voting for him. But now, he’s banned bump stocks and is going after guns, war threatens, I’m done.
2551 2019-06-19 02:33:42 Stocks I avoid
-psu
-grps with multiple listed entities
-media hungry
-promoter says profit isnt main objective
-all promoter family in the company
-dependent on nature
-where promoter experience is unrelated to current business
-any regulatory overhang

Saved me lot of money.

2573 2019-06-19 02:18:21 As a conservative republican, I cannot support him until he reverses his unconstitutional bypassing of congress to outlaw bump stocks. Once he does that, he can have my vote. That isn’t too much to ask of a public servant, is it?

2659 2019-06-19 01:20:45 I think a lot of this could be avoided by not looking at the stock, and focusing on what the business is doing. The whole "it's up 20%/down 20%" thing, I mean I've had stocks drop 25% on me right after I bought them but after double checking the work, doesn't really bug me.
2660 2019-06-19 01:19:37 Two main reasons for this imho... 1) Different investor perceptions / narratives (BTC is digital gold, global money, etc.) which reflects changing demand.

2669 2019-06-19 01:10:56 But that was actually the intent & sense of my thread in the first place--yes I know stocks are not fully defined (tho they are probably now close to more so than ever before), and that substitutes exist (which I brought up), but largely this was precisely my point.

2671 2019-06-19 01:10:27 yeah? those investors would change their minds when they see the sales for that game, also are you pointing the article that said nintendo stocks drop prices? there are more factors there than a delayed game, such as nintendo not having a concrete plan about cloud gaming 1/2

2692 2019-06-19 00:57:44 EVERYONE is pushed into high risk investments.  Most of us have no business investing in stocks. But with our money depreciating year after year, we have to.  Mainstream economists think this is a good thing.  They've lost their minds.  The whole field is insane.

2717 2019-06-19 00:40:15 Stocks: No sign of intramonth dip as investors bet on Fed rate cut. It is okay, the next larger trend was to be up for a couple of weeks yet. But can end with an important peak. Last week there was some ugly biz/econ indicators. The long-term topping continues. But Fed?

Contrary to @GOP and Trump claims, DEBT-fueled #GOPTaxScam created few new jobs above 2011-17 average.

The stock markets rose in 2017 but have leveled since then.  Most people don't own stocks anyway.
2724 2019-06-19 00:35:56 I think @BeyondMeat makes really good products, and it's stock from IPO to now shows how it, and other products in this market will trend. New fintech, food & beverage and tech stocks are only just emerging and are very impressive; they will dominate.
2725 2019-06-19 00:35:41 The only reason the economy is still afloat is because of the tech industry. They aren't affected by the tariffs, and people are hiding in their stocks!
