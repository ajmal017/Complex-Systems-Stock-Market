38 2018-12-09 23:43:09 RT @EdwardTHardy: The start of December has been bad for US stock investors

Almost $1 trillion was wiped from the value of stocks in just 4 days of trading
39 2018-12-09 23:42:16 No wall, stocks down, companies closing, 1000’s losing jobs, farmers bankrupt, ACA not more comprehensive or better, no tax benefits for middle class If this is a good job you obviously don’t know what the job was supposed to be
40 2018-12-09 23:41:50 It’s Sunday night, futures are down, and investors are bracing for another volatile week. It’s been trade, and Trump, and maybe, it’s just the Fed. But a pause isn’t a panacea. Focus on your long term goals. Review your allocations. Adjust if needed. #investing #stocks
41 2018-12-09 23:41:10 You better sell your stocks because the DOW JONES will continue to slide down & you will continue to lose money. the time is now, sell or you will counting your loses & be sorry when is going to be too late. THE ONLY SOLUTION IS TO SELL YOUR STOCK, play smart
42 2018-12-09 23:39:47 @volalitegap @GreenlightEmpire not likely, a fed pause would signal a recession and stocks would free fall.
43 2018-12-09 23:39:35 Hey... Looks like buying that dip Friday paid off in stocks, huh?

Futures looking good 
44 2018-12-09 23:39:26 Stocks are seeing lowest MACD numbers in history right now.
45 2018-12-09 23:39:12 You should be the #SPOTY ..you were amazing last week. @BronzeBomber was gone for parts of the fight....next time....I think you could put pressure on him and stop him. Wilder is a hell of a fighter too. Both your stocks rose.  Joshua is a tarnished brand now..who likes a duck?

48 2018-12-09 23:37:17 China/US tensions have come back to the fore with the arrest of Huawei CEO in Canada last week. This has caused a negative environment across financial markets with US stocks tumbling Friday after largely ignoring the weaker than expected US Payroll data.

54 2018-12-09 23:28:16 That’s why his pussy ass is playing with items. I dare this nigga to play 4 stocks with no items (competitive mode. Where the real killas at.) and say “this is not a real fighting game. It’s not based for 1v1.”
55 2018-12-09 23:27:10 Yes people spam it that much. I saw 3 different k rool matches and 75% of the stocks taken we're from down throw

-aggregator of fragmented trading venues, like stocks and fx (exchange A has an higher Bid than exchange B lowest Offer)
-during fast markets the maching engine just mess things up for some second

65 2018-12-09 23:18:41 Do you have any views on #SecurityTokens, Tyrone? The SEC seems to be viewing them positively & IMO they represent the bridge between standard stocks & #blockchain tech. The regulatory compliant tokenization of existing stocks, as well as physical assets, seems a no brainer...
66 2018-12-09 23:18:38 Don't play the penny stocks.
67 2018-12-09 23:17:42 Most people do not remember when stocks crashed in 2000. If you know why they did, you will see how duped people are these days.

so I can pay my taxes five months later.”

71 2018-12-09 23:15:58 Quick matches works like this:
-choose a character (you cant swap it if you choose to rematch)
-doesnt matter if you choosed yo play on stocks the game throws you on a random set of rules
-yes there is input lag
72 2018-12-09 23:15:05 Do you remember the Patriots before Bill?  Pete Carroll years, Parcells, before that?

They were the laughing stocks of the league.  For decades.  Your take is horribly misguided.
73 2018-12-09 23:14:16 delusional again I see. All you did were EO and deregulated things. Now America is at risk for poison in food and water. Farmers are declaring bankruptcy and businesses are closing. Stocks are falling   Yes. You did a lot of harm
74 2018-12-09 23:13:34 Some investigative resources should be used to find the major donors of the GOP across the country trying to disenfranchise the voters. 

People can then go after the donors. Make their stocks plummet, their products fail!

There should also be laws against dark money of any kind
75 2018-12-09 23:13:00 Lol with stocks just dropping on the background

78 2018-12-09 23:11:44 $KL seems to be outpacing other gold stocks by fair margin - if it keeps its momentum, and if it breaks it’s ATH, it can go on outbreak spree.
79 2018-12-09 23:11:20 you really think  he is too stupid to know it? These kind of piranhas LOVE to tank the economy, buy up all the stocks, then make millions. Come on, if the country is broke would it really affect Trump?
80 2018-12-09 23:10:37 There are a lot of bullish setups but they have not confirmed yet and i doubt they do till $SPY PSI goes bullish which measn we need more selling.. BUT when we get teh turn around there are a lot of good stocks out there to ride the bullish wave
81 2018-12-09 23:10:12 Chaos....Trump creates chaos to hide his wrong doings.  GM layoffs, stocks falling, farmer bailouts, journalist murdered, Russians underfoot
82 2018-12-09 23:09:23 I played a match online. There was lag which could have been worse. It was definitely playable. Are you making sure to background queue? That's the only way I think you can play with custom settings. I set it for 3 stocks, 1 on 1, 5 minutes, all stages and it seemed to work.
83 2018-12-09 23:09:09 Plus stocks are down for year you put America in a depression
84 2018-12-09 23:08:50 Wouldn't it be funny if the entire post-Trump election move in U.S. stocks unwinds? We're getting surprisingly close to that on the Russell 2000 (only another 12% or so); more like 20% is needed for the Nasdaq and SPX.
85 2018-12-09 23:08:07 Sure am enjoying all the winning while my stocks are not
86 2018-12-09 23:06:13 Does anyone own stocks anymore? I cant afford to splurge on Starbucks coffee, let alone their stocks...

88 2018-12-09 23:05:11 Agree. I guess we can anticipate consolidation still happening in small and mid caps.  Most of these stocks have been wrecked and looks ripe for LBOs.  We should also keep an eye on the Windstream judgement in which the verdict could come as soon as this month or early January.
89 2018-12-09 23:03:24 Yeah you lose 2 stocks if you SD

94 2018-12-09 22:55:46 You can't put a COMPANY into a blind trust- he still knows he owns it. You can put a PORTFOLIO of stocks/bonds into a blind trust because the trustee would sell and buy other investments so you don't know what you own.

-Didn´t panic sell stock in the last bear market?
-Will be investing for > 20y?
-Free cash >1y expenses?
97 2018-12-09 22:53:13 Delete this tweet. You're making smash look bad.
Ultimate treats stock battles differently than older entries. Like timed matches, if you SD without being damaged by an opponent, you'll lose 2 points.
Guess you'll lose 2 stocks now if you don't get damaged by someone.

133 2018-12-09 22:23:34 12/9  I favor 90 day treasuries over stocks and bonds given the market uncertainty.   It gives  complete flexibility while earning 2.3% ...not bad in uncertain times.

136 2018-12-09 22:20:17 I need to invest in some stocks!
137 2018-12-09 22:19:12 12/9 Long-term bonds rose in price & both short & long-term interest rates fell after Fed said it may slow interest rate increases.  trump's international policies disrupted trade.  World stocks/economies are slowing.  Fed Reserve is scared. Doesn't know how to fix trump's mess
138 2018-12-09 22:19:05 A recession hurts everyone businesses lay off, stocks lose ground dailey, economy grounds to a halt crazy shit and all the work Obama did to give that moron a good economy he is destroying. Tarriff are already killing free trade and the U S  is no looked to as a leader globally

WHILE THE STOCKS STILL LOW
140 2018-12-09 22:17:34 The candidate performed exceptionally well at their viva.  I recommend a pass subject to minor corrections to the Brexit process, to be conducted within the next three months.  Such corrections to include cancellation and David Davis to be put in the stocks.  Congratulations.
141 2018-12-09 22:17:11 First JoeAlert trade: picked up 330 shares of STAF at $1.53. Probably will sell at $2, I’m more of an options man vs penny stocks. But thanks for the alert!
142 2018-12-09 22:15:55 There were a lot of eyes on the Copa game today because of the controversy surrounding it. Make no mistake, a lot of player stocks went up today. Even some that weren’t on anyone’s radar.
143 2018-12-09 22:15:47 muito épico jogar free for all com os chimpanzés do smash 4 que jogam do 4g colocam 2 stocks e escolhem brinstar depths
144 2018-12-09 22:14:52 Invested in myself and watched the stocks rise 
145 2018-12-09 22:14:49 The idea of an SD stock penalty of two stocks instead of one makes absolutely no sense. The penalty of an SD is innate to the nature of the action
146 2018-12-09 22:14:01 Bitcoin generally speaking is not correlated to anything: It falls no matter what happens to other asset classes. But I do believe that a bear market in stocks would accelerate bitcoins decline as bitcoin is the poster child of the bull market in stocks that started in 2009.
147 2018-12-09 22:13:08 Can you buy penny stocks with stash?
148 2018-12-09 22:12:44 It’s implied over time, Rome wasn’t built in a day. REIT stocks= literally buying the block via Fundrise or Robinhood if your interested.
149 2018-12-09 22:12:40 Don’t let them get you down you’re doing everything right and the things that you do for others is remarkable! You don’t have to do the things you do to teach people about Penny stocks but you choose to because you want people to understand that there is money to be made ! Study!
150 2018-12-09 22:11:42 Could. In what way exactly? The organs are harvested in the UK. The surgical teams are resident here. Plan B is high dose steroids in lieu of medication but stocks remain high so why the fear?

156 2018-12-09 22:09:55 Owning stocks is an investment because you are getting a risk premium, just like you are getting a spread above risk free rate by lending to corporations, are you telling me you are holding currency?
157 2018-12-09 22:07:58 I think SSBU’s online is “bad” on purpose as a statement to the competitive Smashers.  Smash is not just about 1v1s and stocks.  It’s trying to make FFAs viable by having more people exposed to it.

162 2018-12-09 22:05:37 I'm avoiding Healthcare Related Stocks including Pharmaceuticals & Biotech,   The concern is Geo-political.    There may be pressure on healthcare companies to reduce prices.   We are facing massive Budget Deficits and declining excesses in Medicare

165 2018-12-09 22:03:55 The real question is, why do you assume you’re “investing?” Cuz Aswath calls stocks “investment” instruments?  

Apologies, not trying to be arrogant... but you (and As-w) are kinda claiming that this thing called “value” can print money for investors.
166 2018-12-09 22:03:17 Considering the fact that I hold a small amount of Facebook stocks but also dislike scammy altcoins, should I be happy or sad if it turns out to be ZuckCoin?

169 2018-12-09 21:59:14 If I had to spend a million dollars a day for a year but couldn't donate it I could buy hella stocks or bonds or whatever kinda passive investments rich people do and then give tons of microloans to people who need it. People on the street. People in line at assistance offices.

177 2018-12-09 21:46:43 There’s a difference between interest and confidence, crypto is the former and most stocks or assest are the latter imo.
178 2018-12-09 21:46:34 Also really sad how people say what u teach is not legitimate because Penny stocks are a scam.. and you are a scam because of that?! Not the case, penny stocks are not a scam they are just businesses that arent very successful but that’s why we Cut losses quickly! Go Tim Sykes

181 2018-12-09 21:43:00 Happy Birthday to the man @PerchXLV today. Not sure how he isn't a verified account by now @Twitter best smile in the biz and the reason I invest in Folgers stocks
182 2018-12-09 21:43:00 Stocks shares = employment at the company?!?!? Dude, seriously, you’re looking dumb.
183 2018-12-09 21:42:58 I got bonds not stocks bitch that’s how u save
184 2018-12-09 21:42:21 Me: 3 stocks someone

Them: “King K Rool is broken.”

Me: “Sure. That’s what it was.”
185 2018-12-09 21:42:01 That's true for any stock you might be looking at- I still think the point remains- the buying interest (even if you never believed in it- you STILL bought it!) for many is in stocks/ cryptos when they are going higher and interest is lost when they go down
186 2018-12-09 21:41:53 i'm also not sure what the competitive rules are... 2 stocks doesn't feel like enough, 4 always feels like too many. 3 feels comfy. 

i just don't think 2 is enough to learn how to read your opponent, 2 stocks is like "i'm just gonna cheese to win"... idk
187 2018-12-09 21:41:22 Utility Stocks may be OK.  The sector is up 7% year-to-date.  And the federal reserve is signaling they may hold off raising interest rates.  Low interest rates are good for the sector.  Also, US utilities don't have exposure to trump's trade wars
188 2018-12-09 21:39:57 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda

194 2018-12-09 21:37:53 Yes mate same here. Could be a very interesting week on a number of stocks.

196 2018-12-09 21:36:51 STOCKS:  I'm staying away from stocks.  Short term - Oversold and near support levels, so they may bounce.  Longer term, stocks likely to decline. Trend is negative.  Fundamental declining.  Also trading partners hate trump.  No answer of what to do about MASSIVE BUDGET DEFICITS

201 2018-12-09 21:30:19 Yes, marine turbines can injure and kill fish. However, the effect of a tidal lagoon on fish stocks and other negative impacts has to be weighed against the benefits. On balance we feel that it should go ahead.

204 2018-12-09 21:29:51 Also, it’s been proven when markets bust, vice stocks go up cause everyone’s sad. I see this playing out within the next four years
205 2018-12-09 21:29:43 I've been getting people running 2 stocks 3 minutes. like lmao
206 2018-12-09 21:27:31 I love the fuckers doing 3 stocks, 3 minutes. Like what in the fuck.
207 2018-12-09 21:27:28 They as in those who trade stocks.
208 2018-12-09 21:27:10 I'm far more optimistic about my stock portfolio than I am about crypto. 

No, none of my stocks are significantly involved in crypto either.
209 2018-12-09 21:26:58 But first of all, believing that EFCC is inviting him for hate speech is somehow ridiculous. When we read headlines(without at least reading the story)  from (sometimes)  mischievous media and believe it, that's part of how we make ourselves laughing stocks.
210 2018-12-09 21:25:37 gotta love when you queue for 1v1, stocks, no items, and then you fuckin join a free for all or a fuckin timed match with items
211 2018-12-09 21:24:22 A few hours left take the time to sharpen ur skills, get rid of old stocks set new alert because of big drops price might be lower also 
212 2018-12-09 21:24:10 AK-47's that are made in the uS, are only semi-automatic, so they're not "assault rifles". Bump stocks don't change the mechanism of semi-automatics firing 1 round per trigger pull.

214 2018-12-09 21:22:10 401k investors are there because of their jobs.  Normally, that would represent a mix of stocks, bonds, money market etc., right. Their dividend reinvestment will buy more stock as prices are low. Are you saying they should pull out and take the tax hit when stocks go down?
215 2018-12-09 21:21:47 Bump firing is a technique,  not a stock. Bump stocks are for infirm people to bump fire with. A ban is basically a waste of time and effort, because there is valid oposition. Best to spend it pushing for better mental health services and checks.
216 2018-12-09 21:19:56 Can you point to evidence of stocks-bitcoin correlation?  If bitcoin shows sign of bottoming and/or entering new bull a lot of stock money will fomo in.
217 2018-12-09 21:18:55 Na man.  I am here for 2 years.  Been buying on all the dumps.  I gots plenty.  Even sold my stocks earlier this year.  Depending on which asset class bottoms first determins which gets a higher percentage of my remaining funds.  I have.
218 2018-12-09 21:17:41 U.S. stocks had the worst start to December since 2008. Dow Jones fell 700 points on Thursday. The trade war needs to end. Free market trade is better for everyone including American consumers that are basically paying higher taxes because of the tariffs placed on China.

225 2018-12-09 21:10:33 Still don’t understand how some “traders” focus on the #bitcoin chart every minute of every day and nothing else. There are thousands of stocks, about 50 forex pairs among other instruments as futures and CFDs. Expand your horizons.
226 2018-12-09 21:10:12 Is the answer......

but ......Im very rich and cushioned from the effects you commoners will feel. And I’ll make millions from short selling the stocks of the firms you all work for 
227 2018-12-09 21:10:02 Les stock options étant un type de rémunération c'est bien comparable. De plus sa plus value elle l'a faite sur des licenciements chez Danone. Donc le péquin lambda ne pourra jamais investir dans des stocks options et encore moins gagner autant.
228 2018-12-09 21:09:20 Is GOLD better than CRYPTOCURRENCIES??  As bitcoin came into favor, precious metals fell out of favor.  Now with Bitcoin on the ropes, will Gold regain its luster???  If so you can make serious money buying gold stocks and gold related stocks such as Gold miners.

231 2018-12-09 21:07:46 $RUT -5.69% YTD vs -1.52% for $SPX. Remember early this year when so many people were pitching the R2K as the best index for capturing the benefits of #Trump's tax cuts and the supposedly roaring US economy? So much for that. #StockMarket #Stocks #Economy

239 2018-12-09 20:57:05 I wished Americans would pay more attention to what in the hell is going on and just how bad things are becoming with our economy. Even if you don't have stocks or bonds, pay attention to bankruptcies, foreclosures even the amount of cars being reposed.  It all matters.
240 2018-12-09 20:56:22 Nope,you can hardly expect your children to believe theres a Santa,while telling them theres no such thing as God? 
Maybe they should run a parallel season,"The Season of Goods,Bills".instead of filling the kiddies Sock with toys,buy them stocks and shares?
241 2018-12-09 20:56:07 Economy relies on consumption. Consumption is fueled by cheap money and the wealth effect from rising stocks and home prices, which was created by the Fed via low rates.  Thus higher rates will slow the economy.  Fed kept rates low for too long and they know it.

248 2018-12-09 20:50:33 Cool idea.  Too bad it’s a socialist concept that your are getting “the fruits of your labor from”.  You could also gain the fruits of your labor through stocks, annuities, etc. But you rationalize social security based on meritocracy.
249 2018-12-09 20:50:06 Wages are down, stocks are tanked, taxes are disproportionately cut to favor corporate interests, our trade deficit is at a 50 year high, and the national debt is steadily climbing to astronomical levels.

258 2018-12-09 20:39:03 Internet stocks experienced a massive bubble, and yet the internet (and some internet stocks) turned out okay. From my perspective, investing in Bitcoin may be similar to if you could actually invest directly in the internet.

Fuck that! 

I buy stocks within my company 2x a month & they match it. 

We are not the same

261 2018-12-09 20:31:31 esta muy mal hecho pones 1v1 y te ponen de 4 con objetos y sin stocks que costaba hacer 2 colas separadas como en el anterior el sistema de ahora lo ha hecho un mono con deficiencia te lo juro
262 2018-12-09 20:30:16 Sorry, it was bump stocks, not AR's.

"They’re going to say, 'You give them bump stock, it's going to be a  slippery slope.' I certainly hope so," she told a reporter at a news  conference.

271 2018-12-09 20:23:31 The SEC and CFTC don't have much to say when cryptobugs argue stocks and commodities are also mostly traded and manipulated by HFTs.
272 2018-12-09 20:23:02 Don t you think that bad news is already for all to see...indices are a mockery...many stocks and sectors down 30 pc..housing is slowing big time ...what s wrong is morons bernanke and yellen pumping when there was no need

282 2018-12-09 20:11:57 This crypto bear market might be extended by the stock market opening tomorrow. If stocks go down on monday dec 10th, most probably, bitcoin follows. If that is the case, the next price target in my view 2950.
283 2018-12-09 20:11:49 How many people die as a result of bump stocks yearly? Property/vehicles are not Constitutional right. Buybacks? So you're wanting what? People to not own guns? How would you get rid of an organization because you simply don't like them?
284 2018-12-09 20:11:12 Enjoyed it very much, though I prefer the "Drag the Transport Secretary through the streets to the stocks, where he's pelted with copies of Northern & Arriva timetables" method.

290 2018-12-09 20:06:37 Stocks are up 30% since Trump. They'll go up again. Democrats don't give him credit when stocks are up either.
291 2018-12-09 20:05:38 Yeah... I bet everyone is lining up to turn their bump stocks in and selecting not to renew their memberships....

293 2018-12-09 20:02:31 I was in London. My local bookshop is lovely, but very small and stocks the bestsellers only. Browsing requires a bit more variety.
294 2018-12-09 20:01:50 Yup.  Longs and shorts both saw it that way.  There more I invest, and learn about investing, the more I realize that risk management is most of the game.  Stocks like these work until they dont.
295 2018-12-09 19:59:08 It's started. Hearing from friends they have had enough trying to trade stocks. Actively, canceling subscriptions and folding in their hands.

302 2018-12-09 19:55:11 If you can it's definitely a good to put something by. Many simply can't afford it but others who can and should don't. That rainy day always comes knocking in the end. Had about a 25% return in a few years on a pretty unspectacular fund in a stocks and shares ISA. It all helps.
303 2018-12-09 19:54:17 Lmao boii thats how u make most home made soup stocks, you boil the meat and veggies and garlic down and then strain it and u have a yummy broth, then add the good stuff u actually eat uwu
304 2018-12-09 19:53:33 Could be, I think all u stocks will go up significantly in the end so this concern of mine will  eventually be a moot point. But until it clears up I personally will feel better owning less of a few of the Canadian players and more African.
305 2018-12-09 19:53:10 Great. I'm not talking about banning all guns. I'm talking about AR15s, universal background checks, preventing people convicted of violent misdemeanours from buying guns, barring those on no fly lists from buying, banning bump fire stocks.
306 2018-12-09 19:52:47 Whygee keeping releasing those nonsense article these days. Their stocks dropped like a roller coaster since BB went to military break. They release those kind of media play, booking way too big concert hall to look like they are ok. ex) the day they released+

309 2018-12-09 19:49:16 So do most Americans.  Background checks are the least we can do.  Banning assault rifles and bump stocks (?) also seems like a good idea.
310 2018-12-09 19:49:08 When it comes to Media play, there are not much BH can do. Big3 companies (Also publicly listed) has many supporters who are not actually fans. They are stock holders and they also try to manipulate the media so their stocks get higher value. And that's why +

312 2018-12-09 19:48:36 Jackie shouldn't buy the deep stocks .

320 2018-12-09 19:41:14 I wish Trump enthusiasts would stop saying the US is booming. It doesn't sound or read honest where stocks crashed hard this past week. Return to trumpeting an economic boom when, and if, it recovers from that.

Wrong. The Brainlets of SSBU know the most intelligent move in this scenario is to go after the one stock to assure that both 1 stocks lose.

348 2018-12-09 19:23:36 For the bears to be right that the bull market is over, it would mean the 2001 bear market never ended. That would mean stocks would have to retest the 2007 and 2013 "highs". That would be the 3rd test of the old high which is what happened in the 1970s and 1930s bears.

371 2018-12-09 19:02:33 IMHO what is happening on Wall St. may have been part of the rich tax cut.  Everyone sells their stocks at high prices, waits until it hits bottom, the buys them all back, plus more, and makes even more money in the long run.
372 2018-12-09 19:00:49 In 2017, J.P. Morgan said that "fundamental discretionary traders" accounted for only 10 percent of trading volume in stocks. This is when traders look at companies' performance and outlook before deciding whether to buy or sell the shares.

Sure.

And at the right angle.

And were able to see into the future to know that he would start shooting.

Easier solution - ban bump stocks, assault weapons and implement gun registration/UBC.

403 2018-12-09 18:28:56 Correction or Bear Market? I’ve said it before, we’re in a correction phase of a Bull Market. This is not a Bear Market for good reason. There is zero recession. Select stocks were too high with high P/Es, and too high for the income. China no problem, Fed rates no problem.
404 2018-12-09 18:28:35 The corporate tax reduction translated into buying back stocks. NO JOBS were created by big corporations as a result of Trump's tax giveaways! Get real!

406 2018-12-09 18:25:38 It would have taken a long time to figure out where the shots were coming from, John Rich. Plenty of people would have died before your "sniper" figured it out. Maybe a ban on bump stocks would be better??

408 2018-12-09 18:25:15 Exactly. Before 1911 no one looked to buy stocks to protect wealth. The bought gold. The dug for it. They worked for it. No one wants to look what ppl did before the Fed or central banks.

410 2018-12-09 18:23:52 Government Motors - bailed out by the government,  given tax breaks by the government- buys back millions of it's own stocks, lays off 14,000 people, and still gives its executives millions in pay. How's that capitalism working out for ya?
411 2018-12-09 18:23:35 I'm glad I only invested a tiny bit in stocks.
People are more important than money, but his Last Will is all we have left of him.
We never received earthly remains; it's still called 'a death in absentia.'
Meanwhile, Trump keeps LIVilng & LIVing w/ not even a shred of gratitude?
412 2018-12-09 18:23:25  There you go, rationalizing again.

We don’t live in a world where investors buy stocks because they love  stock “value”. They buy stocks because they want more money. Go think about that 

{I know what you are thinking 10 levels deeper than where you are right now.}
413 2018-12-09 18:22:24 The stock market is corrupt... no way who would have figured. Markets are manipulated daily, earnings and profit margins are inflated. Share prices rise and stocks are dump just before they’re caught. Insiders then buy back in and repeat the process all over again.
414 2018-12-09 18:21:42 Sounds like a rich person speaking. Probably one with a portfolio of energy stocks and or some sort of advisory position. Just guessing.
415 2018-12-09 18:21:38 The Dow only works with a small group of stocks in the market and they are weighted depending on how many shares are actually available; Visa has more value than companies like AAPL since it has less available shares. #nottheeconomy

420 2018-12-09 18:19:23 The market has gone to shit yet again. I may wait for one more spike to sell and invest in bear market stocks
421 2018-12-09 18:18:45 Do you have a study showing that "NOBODY" complied with a bump stock ban?
Also limiting the sale and production of bump stocks is a net positive towards preventing their use regardless.

424 2018-12-09 18:17:23 @shannonrwatts murder is already illegal, so why would more laws prevent murder? Why would you trust criminals? I’d rather be proactive to prevent or reduce mass shootings than think criminals will suddenly start obeying laws outlawing bump stocks. Criminals will always do wrong
425 2018-12-09 18:16:37 My financial advisor said you people are wrong to blame one source for why stocks drop, but they had no problem blaming Obama.
I don't care WHAT the reason is; I want to know if I'm going to lose the money Eric gave me; losing it too would be terribly emotional.
426 2018-12-09 18:16:32 do both. You're going to have snipers at certain events (we had anti-aircraft guns on the roofs of buildings in Manhattan for a while). We should also ban bump stocks and large capacity magazines
427 2018-12-09 18:14:53 Any specific reason? I recall you saying there was a dearth of stocks a few months back. Has this changed due to pull back?
428 2018-12-09 18:14:41 that's not an argument against snipers at events, it's an argument for banning bump stocks. We can do both.
429 2018-12-09 18:12:04 @realDonaldTrump bump stocks aren't a problem, don't ban them. In fact repeal all gun laws. Back to 1933. Legalize suppressors

444 2018-12-09 17:58:34 I wonder about that. Every single @GOP regime trashes the economy, causing stock market to tank. The 1% are impervious to temporary dips, while we 401k holders suffer. Maybe they use it as opportunity to buy up cheap stocks.

463 2018-12-09 17:44:37 You have no idea if a sniper team could have identified and taken out the shooter at the MGM. How about an end to assault rifles, bump stocks, closing the gun show loophole and a mandatory background check for everyone?

466 2018-12-09 17:43:38 Also keep in mind that with 10 million shares Alpha is going to be in the controlling seat and they could cap the price at $1.50 by shorting stocks at or above the price. This is how they could make money in the interim.
467 2018-12-09 17:42:50 On a peak-to-trough basis this week, the SPX swung ~180 points, or >6% (2800 on 12/3 and 2621 on 12/6), as stocks remain in a period of extreme volatility.
468 2018-12-09 17:42:41 To correct that: he wasn't just early, he was very wrong. He called stocks undervalued in 08 and 09 by his own research, but continued to short. It demolished his reputation, as you know.
469 2018-12-09 17:42:32 Many of us would be fine with a money-saving idea.

486 2018-12-09 17:29:52 Invest in liquid funds, it always work.. even overnight. Markets is not just stocks and derivatives.. there’s is much more. In fact bonds are the real market, stocks are just a volatile subset of it and derogates are volatile subset of stocks.
487 2018-12-09 17:29:26 What about fully automatic weapons and bazookas? I assume you think these should be easily attainable as well for the general public? I’ll give Trump admin credit actually. I’ve heard he’s going to ban bump stocks. Good. Trump admin is right here.
488 2018-12-09 17:29:18 Stocks crashed to levels we saw during the Great Recession so is it a glimmer as to another @gop recession?
489 2018-12-09 17:29:05 Good point but it’s always about perception. It just feels ugly out there because the market has either gone up or down for stupid reasons.  It’s aggravating for those who are investors and not just day traders.  And although $SPY is only down 10%, a lot of stocks are a lot more.
490 2018-12-09 17:28:40 Banning bump stocks going make you feel safer. Any semi can be converted to AUTO! Ban fertilizer also so another Oklahoma City will never happen again. Ban alcohol so no more car deaths by dwi folks.

506 2018-12-09 17:20:32 Remember that time Obama said "Take the guns first, then due process"? 

Oh yeah, that was a Republican with an A+ rating with your beloved NRA & they still back. Now he is banning bump stocks too. 

Democrats never realized that to get gun control we had to elect a Republican.
507 2018-12-09 17:20:31 Yet, you want to bring in more violence with a gov't ban. People are not going to bow down to these bans. VT outlawed bump stocks, 2 turned in. Mass. did the same, 4 turned in. Now what? More bans that won't work?

509 2018-12-09 17:17:42 stocks will have technical bounces even when they are junk companies.  But, in GE's case, it has a technical bounce not so long ago, and now there is no reason for another technical bounce until low 6s IMO.  So there is really no reason for a bounce period at this point

Please consider it.

538 2018-12-09 16:54:57 Ok stocks 101 the market goes up and down. They will go up again and now is a good time to buy and make lots of money.
539 2018-12-09 16:54:05 No, RE is 'overvalued' today allocations wise because fiat is so shit, when you have sound money, it will absorb the SoV functionality that is currently forced to go to stocks/bonds/RE more so than it would with fixed supply money
540 2018-12-09 16:53:44 As long as they generate good returns , i dont care. Stocks are undervalued for a reason. Stocks are richly valued , also for a reason
541 2018-12-09 16:53:25 My last few Uk stocks hit their stop loss last week. 100% of the UK pot which is 2/3 of my funds is now cash. Not doing anything for a while now. Can’t seem to make a single good decision so I think it’s time to pause till the crap settles #ftse #aim

543 2018-12-09 16:51:13 Actually you are both right.  Concert goers probably aren’t aware of safeguards already in place.  And prohibiting bump stocks and an assault weapons ban would also help tremendously.  What is probably unlikely is that a sniper would have solved the LV shooter problem.
544 2018-12-09 16:50:08 Force est de constater que @castorama_fr a voulu se mettre sur le #PickUp / #ClicAndCollect mais que leur système informatique ne le permet pas...

545 2018-12-09 16:50:01 Referencing bump stocks and assault rifles exposes that you are only parroting ignorant liberal talking points crafted to further ensnare your kind in outright thought captivity. A hunting rifle could never be used to commit mass murder rriiiggghhtt?? @johnrich

They believe in holding quality stocks even when expensive.
550 2018-12-09 16:45:47 Just kidding impeach him before he can destroy us any more. I told you all the stocks were going to fall. But you would not listen he has no clue how it works.
551 2018-12-09 16:44:38 Their performance has had to do with pe re-rating. Well played, but continuing to hold the same when new money is coming at high valuation is a prob. I rather close for subscription or hold cash or hold undervalued stocks.
552 2018-12-09 16:42:56 From my point of view, things like tariffs may be bringing in money for the state but tax the individual. Bump stocks are being banned for “the greater good” even though they were mostly used to help disabled people shoot. Civil asset forfeiture is good for the gov...etc.

567 2018-12-09 16:28:00 So rather than prevent mass tragedy by banning bump stocks and also forgoing better screening for mentally unsound people,  you're saying we should have a free-for-all & let mass chaos continue. 

The end result of snipers is death.  Why not try to stop it without death?

579 2018-12-09 16:19:45 Nick is wrong, this is exactly the attitude that the EU want us to adopt. So when the French threaten to veto unless they have access to U.K. fish stocks you can’t just agree to “get it done”. The same applies to Gibraltar, Ireland and all of the other ransom demands. It matters.

600 2018-12-09 16:05:30 Banning bump stocks, improvements on mental health care, maybe if you have to buy special insurance to own a gun, take safety classes, and pay taxes on them like property/vehicles? Buybacks for the ones already in circulation. Getting rid of the NRA wouldn’t hurt either.

605 2018-12-09 16:00:51 I love at this and this is why I get the feeling we should play 4 stock in this game. Advantage state is very strong in this game and once players get better I think these super fast stocks will be common.

641 2018-12-09 15:35:37 Stocks R reacting to outside issues. The REAL story is the ECONOMY!
642 2018-12-09 15:34:55 If you manage $10 million in fund size (assets less debt or short position) and if you are short $1 million Tesla stocks, your short position is 10% (or -10%) of fund size. Shouldn’t be too difficult to calculate that number.
643 2018-12-09 15:34:21 That’s what I think!  WTF

646 2018-12-09 15:32:20 The following OTC stocks have major catalysts that should be announced in the coming months $VRUS, $ARGQ, $SHMP, and $MLHC IMO. The market should respond positively to these announcements.

657 2018-12-09 15:21:41 There have been many times when a death cross appeared, such as in the summer of 2016, when it proved to be a false indicator. Those who got out of stocks during the summer of 2016 missed the sizable stock market gains that followed throughout 2017. 2016 death star is an example.
658 2018-12-09 15:20:48 Hi Thoth - It doesn't work with bwmMischelle and TheManrulebook they blocked me which I am ok with because they will never agree with any DD we can provide about OTC stocks because they believe all the OTC filings are lies. Now Twitter is peaceful again LOL.

674 2018-12-09 15:07:21 The stock market is down this year. Is that Obama’s fault as well? If you read graphs, the stock market was on an upward trend all through Obama’s Presidency. So, if you want to gauge Trumps Presidency solely off of an uptick in the stocks when he won, pretty silly.

680 2018-12-09 15:03:59 Exactly! Those crappy thumb hole stocks are hard enough to get a hold of in the first place. Holding it like that is just begging for an ND.
681 2018-12-09 15:03:47 The time to stop inflows was 2017 and not now....now is the time to buy good stocks...available cheap!

But y would any amc stop inflows...it affects the money they make.

Morever people who sell mfs have targets and dont have any understanding of markets!
682 2018-12-09 15:02:33 Since the market closed on Friday, POTUS has been implicated in a court of law of criminal activity. But, by all means, buy more stocks as the talking heads on CNBC will tell you... #Sheep
683 2018-12-09 15:01:57 Do you have any tips on where to start with investing in stocks and shares?
684 2018-12-09 14:59:44 100% correct. I noticed this pattern in dolly's portfolio. she always pick stocks which have doubled.
685 2018-12-09 14:59:34 Nothing in particular. An aggregate portfolio of expensive stocks can blow up. While their since inception returns will still be v good, deservingly, but since inflows are not stopped at expensive prices, new investors experience will be v terrible.
686 2018-12-09 14:58:24 Mf universe will not have many undervalued stocks.......momentum investing is also a problem in many funds buying expensive stocks and selling stocks which go down...value investing in mf is dificult!
687 2018-12-09 14:56:22 Been contemplating whether to buy the DMUMT album (Allegro version) and the 2019 seasons greetings, so now.. I've finally decided to  buy it. I'm just hoping that there are still stocks. *crossfingers*
688 2018-12-09 14:54:50 Its not about good or bad. Its about owning overvalued stocks without stopping the inflows
689 2018-12-09 14:54:46 The former. I know the latter doesn't yet exist. The former, if it exists, could be a fitting location for bringing back the stocks.
690 2018-12-09 14:54:29 I agree about your view of Axis MFs. Which stocks are you particularly talking about though? Brittania? Bajaj Finance?
691 2018-12-09 14:54:06 Our small local M&S in NW7 stocks lambs liver, as does larger local Sainsbury’s in HA8
692 2018-12-09 14:53:15 This is wrong. Derivatives are created to be used along with stocks and infact lot of institutions take or make available derivative contracts along with stocks. In most conditions when they are not a zero sum game.
693 2018-12-09 14:52:26 I still favour the stocks as punishment for them. Cheaper for the taxpayer and far more entertaining.
694 2018-12-09 14:52:21 If they are paying in Nexo, it’s not bad for someone thinking long term investment and accumulation. It’s how it works for dividend stocks that you have set to roll directly into purchasing more shares etc. I could be totally wrong, but I think Nexo is a huge long term winner.

698 2018-12-09 14:49:26 Its not about good or bad. Its about owning overvalued stocks without stopping the inflows
699 2018-12-09 14:49:20 Its not about good or bad. Its about owning overvalued stocks without stopping the inflows. Since all hold such diversified portfolio cannot point which are v bad schemes

704 2018-12-09 14:44:22 Exact, ce que fait le gouvernement en éclusant les stocks est logique et la plupart des gouvernements font pareil dans ce genre de cas. L'erreur (qui a sûrement été faite par les gouv. précédents) c'est d'avoir à un moment donné choisi d'équiper la police avec ce type de grenades
705 2018-12-09 14:44:17 Correct, and as such they need to register as securities and be treated like stocks. Is it appropriate to use a stock as a currency? Or is a commodity more appropriate?

710 2018-12-09 14:40:37 Investors in Sri Lanka should start getting used to wild market swings. Since 26th October investors have been reacting to political, economic instability & shouldn't take the warning as a recommendation to sell. Investors should be picky about their stocks & hold on to them
711 2018-12-09 14:40:35 Notice that proposed "ban" went...nowhere?
There'd been plenty of time to ban bump stocks already - if Trump wanted to.  He obviously doesn't want to.

Of course there's the "everything bubble," so don't keep too much in stocks and real estate either.
716 2018-12-09 14:35:54 Who is willing to buy pledis stocks? Or shares?

#Want_Feedback @pledis_17 @pledisnews
717 2018-12-09 14:35:36 Those are the cost calculations that go into stocks. Stocks are always valued at some multiple of those costs (P/E ratio). Those systems can never grow beyond the effort put in by the creators. If everyone has to "work on" a reserve currency, it's not very useful.
718 2018-12-09 14:35:26 Should be three stocks just because of the overall flow being faster.

(Though still not as extreme as Smash 64 lmao)
719 2018-12-09 14:35:16 AGE should decide ur Body’s Risk tolerance ability not ur Investment’s Risk Tolerance ability
A 30 yr old with liabilities would be out of his mind if his portfolio is stocks heavy(100-AGE rule),similarly a wealthy retired person’s portfolio should be bonds heavy is no thumb rule
720 2018-12-09 14:34:30 So fellas....is Ultimate still two stocks or are three stocks now?

736 2018-12-09 14:22:42 @jimcramer Hi $ Doc. Why don't you believe in a recession, when you are so worried about big parts of the economy? And even if we do get a recession within a year, I'm not so sure stocks need to go down much. I mean, many of them are trading at recession valuations. #madtweets
737 2018-12-09 14:19:58 Let's turn on right wing Twitter see what those cheeky funsters are up to:

" Ugh muslim rape gangs are eating all our British fish stocks"

Ok. Still miserable nut jobs. Good to know.
738 2018-12-09 14:18:24 Uber’s market value will be between 100 and 120 billion at the time of IPO. There is no way hedge funds and other big players won’t be all over both stock options. They’ll be the hottest stocks to buy in all of 2019.
739 2018-12-09 14:17:27 Good job backing that up. I say again, there is cod in our waters, but we don't control the stocks.

Now, would we continue to import most of it? Probably, but from where?

Oh, that's right, Norway and Iceland, which are not in the EU, its Customs Union, or CFP, same as now. Oaf.
740 2018-12-09 14:16:42 It didn't go into the pockets of the People. It didn't end up being Invested in the Corporations so they would be prepared for the largest growth in a Consumer Middle Class in History. It went into cleaning up Corporate Books, Buying back Stocks, creating phony Profits.

744 2018-12-09 14:14:12 the shares are overstated.   if gm is closing down productivity and hasnt done anything to compensate those losses, then the value of the company has to be going down along with their value of their stocks. So something stinks on wall street - again!
745 2018-12-09 14:12:01 I love the OTC world & trading stocks. However I would Never EVER trade away my Ethics like I've seen others do. Some I looked up to 1-2 yrs ago are now the very Shark that preys & dumps on followers they used to criticize. I guess money can taint anyone. Live and Learn!
746 2018-12-09 14:11:58 Nope. Until cup sleeve stocks run out.
747 2018-12-09 14:11:47 Those are what you should be focusing on now. The list is getting longer and longer.  What about the Stocks, what about all the farmers that grow soy beans, cherries?

751 2018-12-09 14:04:19 I think the 1%ers like a volatile market. Especially the friends of trump, who seems to like to manipulate the market. Sharp drops allows them to buy otherwise expensive stocks at reduced prices. Then they can afford to just sit it out until it rises again-which it always does.
752 2018-12-09 14:03:55 No, the solution is not to vindictively drive down the price of oil company stocks. I don't know how this is done, but the solution is to make producers -- not just of oil but of everything -- responsible for the externalities from what they do, so the rest of us aren't.
753 2018-12-09 14:03:43 Can we talk about stocks?

758 2018-12-09 13:57:05 C'est vrai, mais si les autres pays n'utilisent pas ce type de grenades, c'est parce qu'elles sont trop dangereuses (pour du maintien de l'ordre face à des civils). D'ailleurs le gouvernement n'en rachètera pas pour cette raison et ne fait qu'écluser les stocks.

822 2018-12-09 12:41:41 Stricter licensing and testing. Tougher sentencing on illegal firearm sales, elimination of “bump stocks” by making them completely illegal. All guns should be re-licensed every year (including inspection for modifications and usage)
823 2018-12-09 12:40:51 Ross it’s not 16 P.E
It’s the prospect of a FUTURE P.E going down 30- 50% or stalling growth .

Multiples are leveraged by growth % 

Many stocks will have 30- 60% lower intrinsic value.

Happens every time

Its where the puck is headed not where it is ..now.

860 2018-12-09 11:36:50 My opinion is this. Federal Reserve raises rates. That pushes down stocks. Institutional traders sell as the market moves up to retail investors.  Market makers have a ceiling to sell at. Don’t worry.  After the market falls low enough Institutional traders will buy again cheaper
861 2018-12-09 11:36:48 @sunshinelu24 why dont you turn your Company from a crypto into a normal stok based Company? Switch the coins into stocks and remove #vechain from this sick cryptoworld. Keep using mainnet on the blockchain. 
Let partners pay for the mainnet and pay dividents with your profits.
862 2018-12-09 11:36:45 Agreed, that's really all they intended. The legislature, while tone deaf, isnt stupid enough to believe a million people will comply. In 1990, very few registered their "assault rifles", and recently I read that zero bump stocks were turned in.

886 2018-12-09 11:09:23 In active funds at least some application of mind, good or bad, has happened in choice of stocks. Not so in passive funds driven purely by flows.
887 2018-12-09 11:05:02 Do you comprehend their all payed for nothing has happened nothing will. Bump stocks is absolute nonsense they looked for the simplest thing to make it look like they did something. And a study wow that will stop a lot of bullets.

890 2018-12-09 10:59:09 Yes, that is true. Many get richer in a stock collapse by investing in the collapse itself. Even more have insider info that allows them to sidestep the collapse by selling 'about to plummet' stocks at high price then buy them back a very low price when they bottom out.
891 2018-12-09 10:57:08 He banned bump stocks and allowed the CDC to study gun violence. Trying to get anything through the legislative branch is a waste of time because of hyper partisanship which isn’t going to change anytime soon that’s why no pro or anti gun bills were passed even when republicans

896 2018-12-09 10:49:03 When Trump took office, I engaged in a stock market experiment. $50.00 in supposedly “High Return” stocks chosen as “best bets” by experts on Wall Street. Today the value of those stocks is $18.31. MAGA my ass.

908 2018-12-09 10:31:11 Valid point but with bonds, stocks, and commodities like oil correcting, I think investors will still look for alpha where they can. Considering BTC has corrected ~85%, it’s a much more attractive asset than cash holdings imo. Plus fundamentals improved drastically this year.
909 2018-12-09 10:30:37 More stagnation than anything and a crash is coming unless the shit we saw recently with companies stocks is what would be considered a crash for them (not an expert when it comes to finances other than i want more money)

924 2018-12-09 09:58:49 All businesses that Yelp has attacked with fake bad reviews, I find it amazing  they are still in business. But not for long. Their stocks have crashed by 70 %. Yelp is breathing through a straw. Their bogus reviews and unethical business practices, has caused their demise.
925 2018-12-09 09:58:08 The sort of people who need to be placed in town centres, in stocks, and publicly shamed. Lot to be said about mediaeval punishments.
926 2018-12-09 09:58:01 Stocks are heading for the worst year since before Obama, Ha - Trump Supporters Can't Put This On Obama Or The Clintons. Lol
927 2018-12-09 09:52:34 I really think the best place we can start making some changes is with background checks and mental health. Getting rid of bump stocks and like you said really large magazines. Those would be a good first step, and is approved by the majority of americans
928 2018-12-09 09:49:39 My recent comments re starting in stocks apply (largely) to ETFs. Open a brokerage account. Most have all ETFs available. Then investigate according to your interest. In general, I would stick with Satrix, Sygnia & Coreshares ETFs. Most brokers offer off-shore acc's too.
929 2018-12-09 09:48:46 Does Trump have a hotline to the employment agency. I bet they must keep stocks of dumbasses in the cupboard.

939 2018-12-09 09:35:13 At one point, over 80% of the USD holdings were outside the US.  If all these countries stop wanting to hold USD... it plummets... and not by 80%.

The USD dominance is held together with smoke, mirrors, and threats.

Americans have no where to flee to... Stocks are in a bubble.

948 2018-12-09 09:20:10 Not to mention that uranium one was/is Canadian owned and it took 9 Departments of government including Treasury and Obama to sign off on it plus no uranium left the country. It was about stocks. A quick google search tells all about it.

950 2018-12-09 09:18:25 How many retail have got stuck in KRC, AVZ etc.., and many of  the lithium /cobalt stocks at high prices ? Really bad scene but no one wants to talk about it.
951 2018-12-09 09:16:50 who knows about stocks and what apps to use or what sites to use to do them? need answers to these questions

958 2018-12-09 09:11:43 Naa and you are absolutely right. That idea is very ideal for someone like my homeboy though. Who’s super into J’s and Nike’s. I’m into heels and boots and etc. imma ask him about the stocks idea though.
959 2018-12-09 09:10:54 So I was it bloated when trump was praising his great work onthe stock market but suddenly trump is MIA when the stocks are at a long time low since 2002. I hope trump supporters keep the same energy they did before because this is also trump great work

964 2018-12-09 09:01:22 Unfortunate but way she goes, I’m sure everyone has some stocks they got caught in at some point. Another reminder to us to not get too caught up in a company that we ignore red flags
965 2018-12-09 08:58:52 Just now? I thought there were Lyft stocks already.
966 2018-12-09 08:58:23 Sir.. if i understand it correctly then in case of inflated stocks bears short sell them to bring it to around its fair value. But that is applicable only in case of F&O traded stocks which are approx 200. what about others? how does bear benifit there?
967 2018-12-09 08:52:53 True,most of the quality auto ancillaries & industrial stocks commanding premium valuation now,but BEL looks very attractive  with long-term track record of wealth creation (not as a recommendation, I'm not invested in BEL)

995 2018-12-09 08:16:40 neoliberal individualism of the media tries to convince us that things are better because stocks are going up, despite the fact that the people who work for a living still haven't recovered from 2008.
if our scenario isn't better, it's because of a personal failing on our part.

1020 2018-12-09 07:31:11 @Valuetrap13 Had noticed in recent weeks bellwether defensive stocks going straight up (classic Q4 early bear market signal from 2000 and 2007). Just noticed mega-cap pharma/health care stocks with big YTD gains. A 2000 parallel--Vanguard health care fund up 50% that yr I recall.

1022 2018-12-09 07:28:27 Madame Fancy Pants in Cuba St, Te Aro was my go-to for cool designer gifts. The same block as Fidel’s, but other side of the street.

Say Hi to Clare if you trek over there!
She makes jewellery & stocks other struggling NZ designers.
1023 2018-12-09 07:27:59 Going conservative (not politically) and getting total stock market ETFs like $VTI, was previously going super aggressive in tech stocks and made a lost a bunch. Barely a few hundred in the green so just moving on now.

1029 2018-12-09 07:16:42 When I talk about 2600, I'm referring to a range around that area. I don't ever look at price levels as exact stopping or reversal points. I look for stocks/indexes to trade around that area before turning or breaking through

1034 2018-12-09 07:06:36 Inflation, over time, the value of the saved currency drops. Instead of just letting your money sit in a box, the rich would invest or buy stocks to gain more dividend/profit. Your money ought to make more money for you!
1035 2018-12-09 07:05:19 Stocks can stay oversold similar to overbought timeframe.  You haven’t state any theory or logic other than you feel/think it can’t fall 20% from here. Another 15% isn’t that far out.

1045 2018-12-09 06:51:30 Trying to not have any negative bias on the markets but the price action on the indexes is certainly not presenting the bull case. 

Yes some stocks still look healthy but should markets get into panic mode, then these too will be tossed out irrespective of earnings

1050 2018-12-09 06:42:53 At the individual stock level. For the whole,  it all comes down to my job and personal interest: know long term if it's a good period for holding stocks over other assets.

The world changes when you think in terms of selling your cash for other things. @chigrl
1051 2018-12-09 06:42:20 As stocks rise to new highs and fall to new lows, correct and swing...no worries when you play the long game. Doesn't matter. Spartan's hold.

1053 2018-12-09 06:40:33 He said that about stocks which for stable companies at least have a base price that you can figure out by looking at their assets, P/E ratio etc. The only base for bitcoin on the other hand is zero.
1054 2018-12-09 06:40:07 Your math needs work. Specifically when & why it occurred. Stock market skyrocketed upon 2016 election. You measure upon when he was sworn it. Stocks dropped following DNC takeover of house in 2018 election. Stop believing talking points.

1072 2018-12-09 06:12:10 There’s also a lot of volatility right now which is why stocks are going up huge and dropping off just as much. Plus students are graduating with useless degrees and no skills. The labor market is severely weakened and many businesses can’t afford their employees.
1073 2018-12-09 06:11:47 Wrong Nawaz Sharif and Stock market movement have no correlation. Stock market hit all time high due to over excitement of MSCI index inclusion and investors thought that foriegn buyers will buy their stocks at higher prices but they are expert which resulted in massive drop.
1074 2018-12-09 06:09:48 How many trades/stocks can do for intraday..3-5stocks orelse 10 trades?#AskAmitAboutStocks
1075 2018-12-09 06:08:59 Kind of. it measures how many stocks are making new highs in the $NYSE or new lows. Then it measures the STD deviation. dark red/green is above std dev, and a light colored red/green is below. Not a typical volume measurement that you see.
1076 2018-12-09 06:08:43 The worst part of World of Light for me is that I'm constantly thinking "If I had Shulk this would be so much easier". Or the fact that some of the spirits are stupid hard and would be so much better if you were given 2 stocks instead of 1.
1077 2018-12-09 06:07:06 Also. I do not understand the fact that they have Billions of pesos in bank and stocks yet they ask us to donate money for their feeding program, church repair, missionaries and stuff.

1116 2018-12-09 05:14:27 I like 3 stocks but not because of the safety net factor for stuff like this, I really don't think adding stocks makes it so that the better player always wins, it gives them a chance to make a comeback but there's still ways people can play with leads to make that less likely

1143 2018-12-09 04:50:14 Pag nakaipon ako bibili talaga akooo. Mga sobrang stocks hahahahah.
1144 2018-12-09 04:47:26 @ScottWapnerCNBC please ask @petenajarian what he would do with $TGT. It's one his favorite stocks, and ever since he started recommending it,  I've been short the stock. Now that's it's down 24% from the highs, I would love to know what he thinks. #contrarian
1145 2018-12-09 04:47:02 Volatility is the double-edged sword of the stock market. It's good news for covered call writers who can stomach the possibility of stocks getting called away.
1146 2018-12-09 04:46:09 Good questions to ask, but these questions may apply more to an individual stocks behavior than that of the entire market. IMO.

1149 2018-12-09 04:42:41 My proudest ultimate moment thus far: won the k rool mirror against a guy who queued 2 stocks 3 minutes by timing him out while at 200%. He ate a crown in sudden death.

That's for queuing with a stupid ruleset dumbass

1154 2018-12-09 04:34:36 Just read an article titled “Stocks headed for the worst year since 2008 crash.”

Got scared... read the article. 

2008 Crash: -38.5%
2018 Prediction: -1.5%

I hate what news has become these days.

1158 2018-12-09 04:26:34 Does that include their entire families? Did you leave a giant loophole in the bill so you cant invest in stocks, but your buddy at Schwab can do it for you? Will you have to sell all investments immediately? Why is it only stocks? What about other kinds of investments?
1159 2018-12-09 04:25:37 Headline said stocks are heading for the worst year since 2008-- And, if any of this impacts the housing market then this is some good news
1160 2018-12-09 04:25:25 AP reports today that U.S companies have sent a record amount of cash to shareholders. $420 billion with a month to go!  Problem: $ is going to wealthiest 20 percent of population that owns 80 percent of stocks.  Workers are not getting raises or bonuses.
1161 2018-12-09 04:23:32 Jim some active traders short stocks they want the markets to fall further.  Dont buy the dip til $FB Hits double digits then buy for a dead cat bounce

1167 2018-12-09 04:13:26 I'd much, much rather change time to stock at the start of a match than have to back out of several menus to change the amount of stocks we're using or add a minute to the timer.

Smash Ultimate: "Okay, here's a four player match in stamina mode on wrecking crew with all items on"

I can't believe Smash 4's online system was better
1176 2018-12-09 04:04:10 One thing I really dislike about Ultimate is how setting up rules works. Everything is on a separate menu now. Its less convenient to just adjust a small setting between matches.
If I just want to change the match from 2 to 3 stocks, I have to back out. Its frustrating.
1177 2018-12-09 04:03:05 Not as bad as CBS makes it seem... Everyone knew the uptick in the stocks had to stop at some point. I think too many people blame POTUS. Aren't you the same people who said Obams set up this economic situation? So... Shouldn't he take the blame as well?

1181 2018-12-09 03:58:43 what part dont you understand? Real estate price has risen for 20 years, stocks 10 years, currency bad since US interest rate hiking, even living expenses like food cost are all worsen everyday. Why on earth do you have to fight for old US IRAN law to damage your own living?
1182 2018-12-09 03:55:08 I have mortgaged all my stocks with a bank in order to lock them for 20-30 years. Hence, I can't sell them in any circumstance

1192 2018-12-09 03:43:12 Problem is with no buyers y’all don’t have a bottom. Better switch to canibus stocks like the others. Then the big buyers will pull the rug from y’all once again.  #toearly
1193 2018-12-09 03:42:55 What about when you front load shit stocks like $cuv and $isol and then promote it?
1194 2018-12-09 03:40:53 Very smart to take advantage of the dips in stocks.
1195 2018-12-09 03:40:41 So is the USD, but it'll probably linger for a while....unlike XRP which is useless. If you actually used it, you would know this. The things I got last year were experimental,  like XRP. The things I've had for a few years like silver,  stocks, and BTC are not "experimental."
1196 2018-12-09 03:40:20 I have a switch as well, a PS4, PC, and was a old Xbox 360 player. And guess who does care about console wars. The dudes who's company value and profits rely on them. That's why exclusives exist. To protect their stocks and profits, lol.

1202 2018-12-09 03:36:42 Previously, I was chided for the term TBAW since though it was obviously not destroyed from all the supposed bear catalysts, it was not up compared to other tech stocks. Since then, $TSLA has outperformed $QQQ, up from both the beginning of 2017 and 2018.
1203 2018-12-09 03:36:31 Great. Compilation of so much of data ! Very useful.
Do we get portfolio stocks also somewhere ?
1204 2018-12-09 03:35:41 I’m not saying it’s not. Just saying the feel is the same. It’s a different level of run up this time. Not as severe, but stocks like MSFT went from 55-60 area to under 20 and then did nothing for 10 years. Others were worse.  I have no idea, but helps realize what’s possible.
1205 2018-12-09 03:34:53 Very well said
1206 2018-12-09 03:34:51 Styx Bump stocks are not technically Illegal. A machine gun is a weapon which shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot, automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger. BS's require more than 1 trigger pull.

1208 2018-12-09 03:33:51 Looking for stocks to trade the overall market weakness off Monday morn. Initially looking at stocks on 52 week lows, but knowing the chop thats been, moved to looking for weak stocks that have had a recent bounce & r topping out/coming off, maybe recent news has pushed them up?
1209 2018-12-09 03:33:34 I’m seriously wondering if his family/organization is shorting stocks. They take a short position, he posts some crazy trade-related tweets, the market plummets, and they make $$$.
1210 2018-12-09 03:32:46 For those of us with little to no investments, and no stocks.. Without as much to lose, it really is terrific fun!
1211 2018-12-09 03:32:42 Reasons to be bearish

- Fed rates going up --> interest rates going up --> borrow
- wages/employment data stagnant = less consumption.
- geopolitical turmoil.
- tech stocks, crypto already bearish. Private property, gold, other safe havens are on the up.

1215 2018-12-09 03:28:00 Yes, Jimmy. I love this market, and yes Jim it’s b/c I’m underinvested in stocks b/c employment, the primary driver of stocks, is full, and the Fed is pulling the punch bowl. Not rocket science. I’m beginning to find that many in HR77 are a bit slow on the take.
1216 2018-12-09 03:26:31 The fact that stocks have dropped to where they were about a year ago is very concerning for someone who's been invested in stocks for about a year and a half

1223 2018-12-09 03:16:34 @surya_here sir based on P/OP how can we select stocks???.  Is positive P/OP means stock will bearish vice versa???Is my assumption correct or wrong sir???  Pls suggest me. Tq
1224 2018-12-09 03:16:26 It doesn’t really remind me of 07-09. It reminds me more of 00-02 early action.  New tech led run up, core of major leaders called 4 horsemen (like FANG).  AD line fell away before peak, news wasn’t bad really just ran out of air, stocks got ripped on decent earnings, etc...
1225 2018-12-09 03:12:20 I have a portfolio of coins  (at all time lows)  not selling or adding, crypto markets are crazy, I prefer stocks

1229 2018-12-09 03:10:07 ? I meant Cheeto. He lives in Manhattan and everyone thinks he knows about stocks. Not trying to be nasty. My tweet was kind of a trainwreck because I don't like saying the idiot in chief's name. Sorry. Not mad or anything at you. 
1230 2018-12-09 03:09:35 It will if you believe in cyclical stocks.
1231 2018-12-09 03:08:28 I just lost momentum and literally spent my entire stocks on the edge getting reacted to for each getup option. That was a large factor. I really need to find a way back up vs this characters guard options. Obviously it was well played on his end as well but I'll need to review.
1232 2018-12-09 03:07:52 If you are slave to your emotions, it is almost as easy to loose money on good stocks as on bad.

1234 2018-12-09 03:05:48 Anyone blaming what has happened in the stock market over the last few weeks on “algos” doesn’t understand that people are making decisions to sell billions of dollars in stocks, not computers... Portfolio managers

1236 2018-12-09 03:00:23 All my ammo is gone. I even cashed out stocks in the summer to buy. I’m buying paycheck to paycheck now.
1237 2018-12-09 02:59:44 3% is the new 1% - daily range for averages.

6% is the new 2% for individual stocks.

Machines are enhancing the trading opportunities. 

$AMZN moving $100 so often means fundys don’t matter day to day.
1238 2018-12-09 02:59:41 Not locking in gains fast enough, watching stocks revers and holding back to breakeven. Or worse- letting a good profit turn into a big loss
1239 2018-12-09 02:59:30 Suggest me one best book from where you gained more knowledge about stocks.. The best book.. I guess readers are leaders.. @Amit_Gulecha
1240 2018-12-09 02:59:25 In twenty years we'll all be drinking weed juice and selling day stocks from our minds.

And by weed, I literally mean like thistles and dandelion.

And by day stock, I literally mean chunks of time we sell to our temporal alien overlords.

It'll be fun.
1241 2018-12-09 02:57:08 Hoping these stocks hit a 100 a piece
1242 2018-12-09 02:54:52 You can choose how your 401k money is invested. Including bond and commodity heavy funds. Even just investing in stocks is STILL preferable to a fixed pension fund. Any 20 year period still leaves you money way head even if you'd cashed out the day after the crash of 2008.
1243 2018-12-09 02:51:28 I recently saw on Facebook that he is banning or has banned bump stocks.... fake news? Probably if it’s true that’s one positive thing right?
1244 2018-12-09 02:47:05 Yes stocks R risky Period Keep ~20% in individual Corporate bonds rated ~BB <6yr maturity Remainder in market When you are up>15% within any year take some gains and add to bonds Rebalance in January every year NEVER buy bond funds or individual stocks You’re welcome

1245 2018-12-09 02:46:43 True that. Plus, my darn penny pot stocks are also way down. Makes no sense, but that is how it is :)
1246 2018-12-09 02:44:23 Correction plus tax loss selling is creating a lot of undervalued stocks.
1247 2018-12-09 02:39:07 People make irrational, non fundamental decisions all the time when trading. It's the way of the world, if we lived in a trading environment of rational markets, the risk premium on stocks wouldn't be at the zero-sum lows that they are at.
1248 2018-12-09 02:38:34 I’ll trade you in a heartbeat for my snowflake of prime minister.
As a Canadian, i am better off now due to YOUR economy/stocks than before.

1258 2018-12-09 02:28:28 @danshep55 just listened to both your chat with traders podcasts. Had a question... if you only trade the same 10 high beta stocks, why do you review 500 charts every night? Wouldn’t your main basket and indices suffice?
1259 2018-12-09 02:24:40 One reason the stocks are going down is the feds raised the interest rates to fast. I urge everyone to pay down your credit cards and not use them until the interest rates come down.
1260 2018-12-09 02:23:04 Only about half of the people own stocks in the US. The GOP also doesn’t  care about normal people either. ...only billionaires and corporations.
1261 2018-12-09 02:22:53 Really screwed up. My husband and I are retired. We lost all of our earnings on our stocks. This is eating up our retirement.
1262 2018-12-09 02:21:12 Land based farms aren't impossible. BC has bigger issues with the aquaculture industry then alaska... Do they need to put open net pens in direct migration routes of our wild stocks? Closed systems aren't impossible. Even in the ocean...

1268 2018-12-09 02:12:28 why fight over these boys though ? .. now a MAN that’s a different story but not these boys with no credit, no stocks or bonds, not saving to own properties, don’t even know what a 401k is? I’m not fighting over they asses 
1269 2018-12-09 02:11:49 Stocks going down every day in US. most hate crimes ever. Horrible president   Not mine.
1270 2018-12-09 02:11:41 Time to divest my stocks and go for a REAL ROI!
1271 2018-12-09 02:11:32 BUMAHA NG STOCKS HAHAHA Sa mga buyers maya nalang po may lalakadin lang akong importanteng mahalagang bagay :D
1272 2018-12-09 02:11:05 I feel great. Stocks are cheaper :-)
1273 2018-12-09 02:10:20 For anyone that’s looking into investing, NHPI is the investment that’s gonna give the biggest bang for your buck!! I’m one of slowest learners of the penny stocks, but the I thing I’m sure of is NHPI is going to dollars!
1274 2018-12-09 02:09:09 Yeah, I'm in love with it.  It's not gonna take any stocks but you can rack up damage and scare people with it really effectively.  I'd recommend running it with Mach Punch.
1275 2018-12-09 02:08:07 nice
1276 2018-12-09 02:06:57 I believe it would be a good time to invest in the market these days, particularly stocks in Vaseline products. There is going to be a BIG demand for such in coming days. Get in on it while the getting is good. The Left, are so giving, why not make bank on their blunders. #MAGA
1277 2018-12-09 02:05:23 Fooled me!
1278 2018-12-09 02:00:43 Aww, sacrificial stocks don't work with Ridley like they do with Kirby :'(
1279 2018-12-09 02:00:41 I guess I treat crypto like an asset class whereas it doesn’t seem like you do yet. I also optimize my total portfolio (stocks/bonds/crypto) to an expected risk. So if I reduce my crypto exposure I’d need to add stocks (which I didn’t want to do)
1280 2018-12-09 01:59:06 Can't decide if I want a girlfriend or if I should just invest in stocks. Both are risky, both need constant attention, and both can offer a seriously low rate of positive feedback. But, I hear it truly is worth it, so  it looks like I'm investing in Adobe next week.
1281 2018-12-09 01:58:34 Remember when ppl were arguing over whether ultimate should be 2 stocks or 3

LMFAOOOOO
1282 2018-12-09 01:58:32 Hahaha it's a control room of a processing plant, it would be wild to trade there tho
1283 2018-12-09 01:57:43 Worst start of December since 2008 for US equities market. Stocks are down, Bonds are down and commodities are down..
RUNNING A STARTUP = Priceless...
1284 2018-12-09 01:56:47 People need to take responsibility for themselves and stop relying on paid services, join a chat that’s ok but don’t solely depend on the moderator of the room. I can’t believe how shallow people can be when it comes to teaching yourself how to Trade Stocks.

1289 2018-12-09 01:48:21 Walt Disney gave his housekeeper stocks every year for the holidays, and she died a multi-millionaire.
1290 2018-12-09 01:47:51 needed no convincing on the latter.  

not much accomplished on the former.  the thing is, TSLA could have a bright future and be a $100 stock.

many good companies have been crap stocks to own for chunks of their history.
1291 2018-12-09 01:47:50 Lmfao, budget blowing up, stocks dip, and no healthcare due to republican blocking everything just because it’s known as Obama care. Just so you Obama haters it’s real name is affordable care act.
1292 2018-12-09 01:47:50 I agree, crypto should count total market cap because thats how stocks do it.....but keep in mind xrp wasn't mined, ETH was really pre mined and ETH has no limit on asset supply.....
1293 2018-12-09 01:47:42 My stocks way up since Inauguration Day can’t take a short term view
1294 2018-12-09 01:45:37 Stocks down, deficit up. Successful economy?
1295 2018-12-09 01:44:57 Never!
1296 2018-12-09 01:44:33 True, at most it's going to compound on the problems they already have.

Alot of people are already mad at them, & they had massive drops & over 3 months their stocks have dropped about 33% over 6 months it has halfed.
1297 2018-12-09 01:43:01 The twit is about knowing the value of something, in stocks you use the future cash flows and other methods. The idea is to find out if an asset is cheap (price<value) or it's overpriced
1298 2018-12-09 01:42:18 i just played against @juanpi_a1's dark pit on frigate and lost all 3 stocks to the stage

frigate orpheon can get bent
1299 2018-12-09 01:42:02 If you’re looking at Stocks in ur 401(k) or retirement acct of some sort, just sit tight & don’t panic. Unless companies go belly up losing their value, just remmbr u don’t get hit w/the loss unless u sell the stocks. As long as Wall Street doesn’t short everything it shld be OK
1300 2018-12-09 01:40:55 The housing market needs lower rates. This is good for both housing and stocks. End trade war and 10yr bond yield will jump.
1301 2018-12-09 01:38:59 I often wonder if Pro managers even enjoy having more money to invest. Especially, when they crib about inflows at high valuations. 

For individuals, the money available to buy stocks almost always seem inadequate.

We wish we also had flows. Why? We love

1302 2018-12-09 01:38:57 That estimate is actually very reasonable compared to MANY YouTube channels literally predicting that the global stocks will go to zero, the USD will be abandoned and replaced by a gold backed currency, and overnight gold investors with few ounces of gold will become the 1%.
1303 2018-12-09 01:37:57 Just another CEO with little big man syndrome. I predict with the company stocks continuing to down slide, poor Award performance, his outdated negative approach in the industry, the board of directors are going to ask him to step down. Bottom line is it’s all about the money

1305 2018-12-09 01:36:47 Extend his run a little further, and he’s 6 of 17. If you’re not fading this guy yet, you have only yourself to blame! Some of the smartest investors short stocks all the time. You short this guy, and you get rich folks.
1306 2018-12-09 01:35:24 Gonna start trading stocks and crypto
1307 2018-12-09 01:33:11 Nothing is more of a slap to the face than finishing someone off, and having to deal with someone else who still has all their stocks because whoever they were fighting kept SDing.

1315 2018-12-09 01:26:33 I wanted to thank @Tesla, I needed to purchase a few stock that I had as options, I couldn't afford all 40 some odd stocks and I tried to initiate on Dec 5th (Stock Market Holiday). They initiated the small trade manually and worked w/ @etrade to complete!

Thanks Stock Admin!
1316 2018-12-09 01:26:18 "Nobody has to buy anything. This is bitcoin. The only thing that must happen is selling."

1318 2018-12-09 01:24:52 Charlie can’t help himself. Professes to know everything about finances, but always delving into politics when it comes to Pres Trump. Pretends to be personal friends.

1321 2018-12-09 01:18:02 It’s a fantastic phone . But if it’s not gonna be available , what’s the whole point . Even after pre booking at @cromaretail huwawei is unable to honor the delivery date . Should have launched it only if u had adequate stocks
1322 2018-12-09 01:16:23 Not only dependent on stocks
but also dependent on Mutual Funds.

Mutual Funds are regulated such that
they can't sell short during a stock market downturn.

And they can't sell off and remain in cash.

Thus, Mutual Funds are GUARANTEED
to LOSE money during downturn!!!

1327 2018-12-09 01:11:56 If they're going to lose money on CFDs they'll also be losing on regular stocks too... learn how leverage works, minimise losses, take profits and only risk 1-2% of capital.
1328 2018-12-09 01:11:02 ISF=impôt de solidarité sur la fortune=the fortune tax (for solidarity)
Created in 1982, it added up income, property, stocks, securities, etc. and if you made more than 800,000€, you paid a proportional tax for being too rich.

•WarioWare should not be legal

•Fox and Mario are very good. No worse than high tier

•Inklings are strong but idk about number 1. They have counter play

•Frigate should not be legal

•Edgeguarding is important for stocks

•Ridley is very eh
1336 2018-12-09 00:58:58 Request: blue chip stocks most down?!
1337 2018-12-09 00:58:30 But they got massive bubbles in stocks bonds and real estate. They keep the multi-year pump and dump scheme going.
1338 2018-12-09 00:58:25 I just hope international stocks / funds etc. come back at soon, this notion of "diversification" lowering volatility is a LIE.

1340 2018-12-09 00:57:54 From what I understand of Syke's method, the main problem is it hits a wall due to liquidity of small-cap stocks.
I also found when I inquired about an email I'd sent with some pre-sales Q's I was directed to a paid signup page so I'd be able to ask my questions. Another wall...
1341 2018-12-09 00:57:51 You're the only one making assumptions.
The fact is corporations that received tax cuts used that money to buy back stocks at a record amount.
Please give me a source or link to the company(s) building and creating jobs.
Also look up GMs tax cut. How many were fired? 15000?

1344 2018-12-09 00:56:46 We can hope. I mean their stocks have plummeted since the announcement.
1345 2018-12-09 00:56:44 @larry_kudlow stocks are crashing and the Trade deal is a Dud.
1346 2018-12-09 00:54:40 Exactly. Shows our stocks are very, very low. When he’s in form he’s unreal.

1349 2018-12-09 00:47:53 Ronnie Rayguns drove the economy off a cliff and Star Wars/SDI still not viable.

1350 2018-12-09 00:46:53 Still doesn't make sense. You still owe taxes on the IRA when you sell it.  You're probably already going to want to own stocks REITs and bonds above the contribution limits so why not put those in there and keep the crypto low profile where you can avoid all taxes.
1351 2018-12-09 00:46:50 Stocks with low volume but great potential. Which is the Best Buy next week?

$KRFG .0007 to .0008

$PBYA .0007 to .0010
Volume 13.7 million 

$PJET .0005 to .0007
Volume 18.7 million 

$SBFM .0003 to .0005
Volume 14.1 million
1352 2018-12-09 00:43:38 Add in the gerrymandering and citizens united ruling, and it's easy to see why. Just the fact that sitting members of congress can own and trade stocks is utter bullshit. I'm glad to see signs of a movement against this conduct in younger candidates and voters.
1353 2018-12-09 00:42:19 Invest that money in some quick stocks, make a killing as we wait on you? Nah
1354 2018-12-09 00:40:37 Ok, all you wonderful voters. How little faith you have in my ability to diversify! I lost $41,544 yesterday, on paper. Down about 4% in my brokerage acct for the year. #downturn #stocks #buylowsellhigh

1359 2018-12-09 00:34:09 I think the fact that Trump is so unstable now has a serious effect on stocks
1360 2018-12-09 00:31:46 Stocks tend to be anticipatory. External events such as politics (i.e. - not earnings, the economy or interest rates) which has created considerable uncertainty of late can have a short term impact but seldom long term. Stocks have been discounting Trump's fail for several weeks.
1361 2018-12-09 00:31:31 Agreed but at this point of the cycle you would typically avoid holding high PE and high beta stocks particularly those who technically broke a major uptrend. $QQQ fits this category.
1362 2018-12-09 00:30:35 Major corrections (lower values) are on the horizon.  As it bottoms out go against your instincts to run like everyone else and buy the stocks you like when the price lowers.
1363 2018-12-09 00:27:04 Trying-trying!  no bitcoin or pot stocks. :)
1364 2018-12-09 00:26:32 How much did your 401k gain last year under Trump’s administration?  Being invested in stocks has always had ups and downs...
1365 2018-12-09 00:25:51 ROFLMAO. So what will liberals do when they find out that the Dems made before office and multi-millions they“acquire” after being in office a few years. Until a handful of years ago, Dems got inside information on stocks and never got prosecuted, like Martha Stewart=Pelosi thief
1366 2018-12-09 00:24:29 Ha merde, j'ai pris le coffret de base quand la Fnac l'avait bradé à -50% pendant les préco en me disant que les films valent 10 boulles à part.
J'aimerais tenter d'attendre voir les prochains réassort des films, ne-sait-on, mais pas sur qu'ils épuisent les stocks rapidement.
1367 2018-12-09 00:24:04 Yeah but treasury must borrow the money to pay the refunds and that must come from the market because the Fed ain't buying. Stocks will crash in February as that   gets added  on top of already crushing issuance.
1368 2018-12-09 00:21:03 Now that stocks are down.
1369 2018-12-09 00:20:49 Does this market correction scare me? Nope. 

I have no people in FANG stocks and have a short sell on Netflix. 

And I own Tesla, which is nearing its all time highs. 

Plus, my top pick for '18 $PTOTF is up 50%.

• #Gold up towards $1350 — (unvalidation if #GC < $1200)
• #Dollar down — (unvalidation if #DX > 97,5)
• #Yen up — (unvalidation if #USD/JPY > $115)
• #EM stocks outperform #US equities
1398 2018-12-08 23:53:42 Yup -noticed to some extent already.  Some leading stocks with mixed action -but showing resiliency.
1399 2018-12-08 23:53:35 The guys bigger than "OGs" in any space, whether it be #crypto, #realestate, #stocks, #bonds, etc all seem to cash it just in time.

1404 2018-12-08 23:46:15 I read a few tie bits that suggest Trumps tweeted talks with China are not only fake but having a negative effect on the DOW. Perhaps even some efforts to secure lower priced stocks.

1414 2018-12-08 23:56:48 Not hearing much info, just keep hearing the name pop up every now and then. Sounds like it was where weed stocks were 5 years ago. Plenty of reward if you want to wait

1434 2018-12-08 23:40:12 Hey bro. What do u trade on? Stocks or binary?
1435 2018-12-08 23:40:06 nice!
1436 2018-12-08 23:38:42 Wow @realDonaldTrump everything u bitched about @BarackObama doing u have done and more, then u lie about it. Stocks down, 3 COS, illegal immigrants that work for u, u bully, and can’t speak in full sentences.
1437 2018-12-08 23:38:29 Apparently the Red Light zine is by pre-order until stocks last and now I'm panicking to get money into my account to purchase it askdhfakjashf.
1438 2018-12-08 23:37:57 Only nonces use safari. That could possibly be the cause?
1439 2018-12-08 23:36:26 Got super high last night and watched a guy talk about stocks for 30 minutes and was convinced I was a genius and could do it and had 10 tabs open on paper trading. Woke up today realizing I’m a dumbass
1440 2018-12-08 23:35:43 12x, i have been going in and out, being killed a few Times. Bought a couple of weeks ago, so I am currently in. It looks pretty okay, especially IF The dollar and stocks drops which is what it looks like.????
1441 2018-12-08 23:35:30 Not sure about that.... could be two separate, near-by distribution centers. I don't think CP warehouse alone would have the capacity to deal with all that stocks from the OCS alone, but I can be wrong.
1442 2018-12-08 23:34:19 It's the same reason people think the earth is flat and that vaccines are evil. They're what we call our resident laughing stocks.
1443 2018-12-08 23:33:56 The key to trade large caps is to focus on a small group of high ATR names like the FANG stocks that constantly make big moves. The advantage of this is you can master these and learn how they trade. Also, they follow the $SPY and each other so are way more predictable.

1444 2018-12-08 23:33:07 Bump stocks can put more rounds down range but at a lost of accuracy where as a far more accurate weapon such as a bolt action scoped rifle in a larger cal like a 30.06 or greater can drive a tack ...
1445 2018-12-08 23:32:43 find a character you have an affinity towards... use all their moves... take notes about what works... don't be afraid to lose when trying new things... always more stocks
1446 2018-12-08 23:30:27 Waiting for some setups in stocks but they seem non existent or few and far between. Where is the santa clause rally @realDonaldTrump ? $SPY $SPX $DJIA $COMPQX
1447 2018-12-08 23:28:15 I believe they already bought us stocks but through proxy central banks like @SNB_BNS_en 
Trust me, they talk. And yes they will do anything to keep it going.

1449 2018-12-08 23:27:05 Everything new becomes toxic if we don't evolve as the market does. That's one of the characteristics of a map, that which you think is an asset becomes a liability as the market evolves. Stocks of capital aren't static whether activities, practice, data or knowledge.
1450 2018-12-08 23:22:53 Incorrect. The Managment Company owns the underlying stocks. Shareholders have an IOU from a Mutual Company.
1451 2018-12-08 23:21:28 It’s ok @JeffBezos will give me stocks if I don’t get it

1457 2018-12-08 23:11:14 Always an excuse. Also lol yes tech stocks crash when the government starts arresting people, good example of how this bill is damaging the aus tech sector.
1458 2018-12-08 23:08:57 The majority of folks have no investments.  I have friends, who having invested heavily in tech stocks, are losing their minds about now.
1459 2018-12-08 23:08:50 What, are you shorting the stocks!
1460 2018-12-08 23:07:50 Better management & co-operation is the key, it might take time but the IFGs are offering that framework locally. Like it or not we all have to co-exist, in some areas diving foe scallops is banned as it is considered unsustainable ro stocks. We have a mix & we say work together.

1463 2018-12-08 22:59:26 Imma get a sugar daddy and not tell no one. “How’d you get the Benz Ken?” I invested in stocks. 
1464 2018-12-08 22:58:23 As a 30 yr trader on the NYSE, one of the first lessons I learned was to stay away from penny stocks. They are penny stocks for a reason.
1465 2018-12-08 22:57:51 That not to say cannabis stocks can't run meanwhile, facts/logic never have a chance with a good story, especially like cure cancer
1466 2018-12-08 22:57:21 I already bank in stocks on pain, I'm completely destitute on pleasure outside of the momentary feeling you get when eating cuz you're starved.
1467 2018-12-08 22:55:26 My stocks have been in the outhouse lately.  I should be more mature and have a longer term view than to let that get me down.  But here we are.
1468 2018-12-08 22:55:02 Repeal gun laws that are unconstitutional & retroactive.  You dont need bump stocks, remove the patent. If you get caught with a rapid fire gun or device, its confiscated, thats it, no penalty no fine. Rapid fire guns have been illegal for yrs now. Make em happy but keep your #2A
1469 2018-12-08 22:54:55 My dad got my lil sisters flipping houses and buying stocks but didn’t teach me none of that 
1470 2018-12-08 22:54:20 Money.

Russian money, American taxpayers money, corporate shelters & corporate welfare, inflated stocks and ripping off Medicare and Social Security. 

GOP leaders are bought off.
1471 2018-12-08 22:53:39 It is still a great work in progress.  How your stocks doing???  You have any do 10x yet?
1472 2018-12-08 22:51:41 160 million Americans obese or overweight...We spend

1473 2018-12-08 22:50:14 Euro will rally on this news.  Stocks are looking at US / China
1474 2018-12-08 22:48:09 Stocks valuations can indeed be expressed in GDP%, but it doesn’t mean it contributes to GDP per se
You are pointing out wealth effect (If i get right). Let me oppose it ‘s unlikely that a 0% increase of stocks YTD can reverse the Fed compared to stocks up + 500% since 2009; no ?
1475 2018-12-08 22:46:29 Gold $GLD Implied vol still very cheap. Love to be in stocks or asset classes that the public/FinTwit has ignored.
Why?
I get in first and then let the public/FinTwit push my position up.
1476 2018-12-08 22:46:01 Hahaha these guys act as if demoRATs don’t own stocks. Republicans should add an amendment that says Secretaries of State aren’t allowed to use their office to for personal gain.
1477 2018-12-08 22:44:41 there is that reversion to the mean and when they see their growth stocks underperforming, i wonder how they would feel
1478 2018-12-08 22:43:35 apple stocks rise by 35%.

1480 2018-12-08 22:43:11 Another excellent market overview Chris.  The broad US markets (VVC/8100 US Stocks) has witnessed an 11.1% decline, peak to trough from 9/21 on a closing basis with yesterday’s close (48.84 to 43.42). #PatienceForLongTermInvestor
1481 2018-12-08 22:42:59 damn I gotta be quick when Nike stocks up on vapormax cause they be selling out too fast 
1482 2018-12-08 22:42:10 Exactly! No one is born knowing everything and when we all learn together it’s great! Bouncing ideas off of each other, catching stocks that are moving which one saw and another didn’t etc. The lone wolf thing doesn’t work all that well in the life of an entrepreneur.
1483 2018-12-08 22:42:09 The Canadian #PermanentPortfolio up 0.40% this week. A bad week for stocks, a good week for bonds and gold.

ZFL +2.31% #bonds
MNT +1.75% #gold
VSG -0.08% #cash
1484 2018-12-08 22:42:02 Shorting the rips and buying/covering the dips (in individual stocks as much as indices) worked quite well. Similar to 2000, 2015 and 2007 which were all flattish yrs (2000 slightly negative). Reminds me: (1) what's SPX YTD? (2) What happened in following Q1 in those 3 instances?
1485 2018-12-08 22:41:14 If people are going to sell stocks like $YEXT and $ZUO because their loses are growing, I’ll keep hitting the buy button. They are scaling and doing a land grab to own the market in their given industries that have no competition. I expect and want loses.

1488 2018-12-08 22:40:38 The plan is to ban AR-15s and AK-47s because they are weapons of war and no one needs them and we will ban mentally ill people and criminals from owning guns, then we will ban bump stocks and magazines, and the age to buy a gun will go from 18 to 21.
1489 2018-12-08 22:39:41 Good to hear that freezing works on parasitic worm stocks (I had the mistaken impression that they weren't being frozen much).

1506 2018-12-08 22:27:13 Lol. They don’t “hate”, they just love making money by spreading false info. Their hate will be gone once they cover. Then they move on to other stocks. They have no idea what Tesla is all about.

1518 2018-12-08 22:20:21 What else do you want? Should we bring back stocks? Should we ban comedy since this is where thoughtcrime is most likely to occur? Should we form Miniluv and start sending offenders to Room 101? Should he tear his garments and wear sackcloth? He apologized long ago: let it go.

1521 2018-12-08 22:16:39 No, just because it's happened more than once doesn't mean it's not bubble. Sure bitcoin has been gaining adoption throughout but it's had some bubbles along the way. Bubbles are natural consequence of financial markets, happens to stocks, commodities and crypto alike

1527 2018-12-08 22:09:42 Since when. The biggest group of cheaters are the members of Congress. Ultimate insider trading where the rules and laws passed have tremendous impact on the value of stocks. How else do we think these people retire filthy rich? They don’t work for us.
1528 2018-12-08 22:08:53 Where n how do you find these stocks?
1529 2018-12-08 22:08:49 I’m not listeting anyone, I follow shield cricket very closely. Can make my own judgements. I’ve been calling for Kurtis Patterson to come into the team.

The batting stocks are the thinnest I’ve seen for a long time.

Who specifically are you referring to?
1530 2018-12-08 22:08:45 With growth and inflation slowing, interest rates should continue to trend down making treasury bonds your friend. So, with no growth trade, and no reflation trade, why be long stocks unless you’re in staples or healthcare?

1537 2018-12-08 22:04:26 Why nasdac need to list crypto if they have enough stocks?
1538 2018-12-08 22:03:18 Premarket + Afterhour Gap scanners and follow people on twitter who tweet stock news.  I recommend @behindthebid @eWhispers and @OpenOutcrier for starters.  Read the news, trade stocks gapping the most and have the best news catalyst behind the move.  Trade stocks with RVOL 2+.
1539 2018-12-08 22:02:18 i got bonds not stocks bitch
1540 2018-12-08 22:01:36 This thread really sums up investor knowledge in pot stocks dunnit?
1541 2018-12-08 22:01:02 Actually, the correct pluralization is stocks ticker.
1542 2018-12-08 21:56:48 Yea , so see bill gates, steve jobs and other big names NEVER sold their stocks, because of passion and beliveing in their work, so i wonna never again hear people who comparing shitty icos, pump and dump coins and scamers woth amazon appld ebay etc...!!! 
1543 2018-12-08 21:55:32 If I was shopping for a house, I would love it if the housing market fell 10%! Why should I think differently about stocks?
1544 2018-12-08 21:54:35 I like hard copies I am old school.
1545 2018-12-08 21:54:03 #BT21Toronto can someone update me on the stocks for the plushies!
1546 2018-12-08 21:52:56 lol wut? They just cut the buds by themself and smoke it? Not like it's a commodity that's hard to come by in Mexico   Just kidding, but hey, good business for my pot stocks^^
1547 2018-12-08 21:52:03 It is stupid to blame crypto for not being what they are not. I respect people's -me too- investing in them but cryptos are not stocks or gold, even if  BTC returns to 20K.
1548 2018-12-08 21:51:03 Si empezaran por los enormes stocks de la banca rescatada con dinero público ya verías q rápido repercutía en los particulares
1549 2018-12-08 21:49:38 Because you can’t choose what kind of match you want. You won’t be guaranteed a match with items turn off, or use stocks, or have a 1 v 1 because the game randomly assigns you to a randomly generated match. The online is pretty speedy otherwise.
1550 2018-12-08 21:49:28 Users will have full access to trading in stocks, currencies, and crypto-crypto and crypto-fiat pairs
1551 2018-12-08 21:46:53 In years past he said he doesn’t do stocks. Real estate. Who knows
1552 2018-12-08 21:45:01 Banks could fail. Withdraw your cash, sell your homes, dump your stocks. A run on the banks would make assets worthless!
1553 2018-12-08 21:43:32 I’m currently down over $100 in these damn stocks who said this was a good idea???
1554 2018-12-08 21:43:23 I never really cared for stocks but now that I have a job and I’m apart of the economy I’m getting gradually more worried about the DJW crash
1555 2018-12-08 21:43:09 Actually while Obama was in office the market was at historic lows as in lows not seen since the Great Depression. My point is as soon as trump took office my 401k and stocks blew the fuck up and I have made a bunch of money while Obama was there I was just trying to hold on
1556 2018-12-08 21:42:57 Public stocks. Reflecting pool.
1557 2018-12-08 21:41:08 J’aurais archi chercher les stocks sa mère
1558 2018-12-08 21:39:56 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
1559 2018-12-08 21:39:43 Also keep in mind "Billionaires" dont HAVE a billion dollars in there bank account, its mostly in stocks and companies.
1560 2018-12-08 21:39:41 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
1561 2018-12-08 21:39:15 Haha,my God is greater than you!!

1563 2018-12-08 21:38:34 How many stocks do you have of these? Especially stray kids and NCT?
1564 2018-12-08 21:37:22 Go into the stocks, try to make a living with it, do something with myself
1565 2018-12-08 21:30:38 you get grouped up with better players. so you can fight legit 3 stocks and battlefield stages haha
1566 2018-12-08 21:30:21 People keep comparing crypto to the internet stocks.. tell me when could an average person in Russia or China or Brazil or Africa invest in Amazon stock?!?!?.. don’t worry I’ll wait... #xrp and crypto will crush the internet boom
1567 2018-12-08 21:27:51 I would argue stocks not in  control
1568 2018-12-08 21:27:17 Even though Cramer called this meltdown and told us to stay away from China stocks and take profits. #theyknownothing
1569 2018-12-08 21:27:05 put her in stocks for all guards to play with
1570 2018-12-08 21:26:40 The only English language TV channel in my hotel is CNBC Europe and it's creepy as fuck, literally MONEY STOCKS MONEY MONEY BUSINESS STOCKS MONEY MONEY MONEY Jimmy Fallon MONEY MONEY BUSINESS MONEY STOCKS STOCKS MONEY MONEY MONEY STOCKS MONEY BUSINESS MONEY
1571 2018-12-08 21:25:56 Let's be honest though: EA is in a free fall their stocks prices are dropping, their lat games were disasters (especially Battlefront and Battlefield). I'm worried about the quality of both Anthem and DA 4 tbh.
1572 2018-12-08 21:24:19 Yea the stocks telling a different story. 
1573 2018-12-08 21:22:32 2019 is going to be a hell of a ride for tech stocks, @Uber and @lyft have both filed for their #IPO s.
1574 2018-12-08 21:22:27 Look at the market taking a huge dive, huge corps buying back stocks from tax break- NOT adding jobs, small farmers going bankrupt due to poorly thought out tariffs, cutting food stamps to our vulnerable populations, destroying our environment to pay off his buddies......
1575 2018-12-08 21:22:18 Maybe u missed it but all cryptos crash even harder when stocks dump...
1576 2018-12-08 21:22:17 I'm not worried about the stock market. This is cyclical and stocks will rebound. Although I am having a hard time grasping why you are so concerned about my retirement.
1577 2018-12-08 21:22:14 Apparently if you go to background matches you’ll get matched up into stocks better. Try it out bro
1578 2018-12-08 21:22:11 New stocks will be on Dec 12,2018
1579 2018-12-08 21:21:31 @MrLeonardKim U.S. Stocks Markets big 5 has reached $43 trillion dollars !07 before U.S. President has ruing them .now they are recovering at a rate of over $5 trillion dollars per year for ten years straight.the Royal Liven God,s World Economies Rescue ops.
1580 2018-12-08 21:21:24 I don’t like how I can’t jump in a “For Glory” online match quickly. When I set up my no items/ stocks ruleset on quickplay, it throws me in FFAs most of the time #SmashUltimate
1581 2018-12-08 21:19:26 The restart trick works you just gotta do a longer match like 3 stocks so it triggers
1582 2018-12-08 21:18:06 clearly you have no idea what you're talking about because investors dont ask shit to their brokers. owning stocks isnt owning anything physical either. you own IOUs from the broker who promises to give you stock certificates. you just simply dont understand how wall street works
1583 2018-12-08 21:17:01 the more I see how sum of yall act I swear I dont want yall buying parts of BH stocks when they go public.
1584 2018-12-08 21:15:14 Mdrrrr y’a les stocks surtout.
1585 2018-12-08 21:14:58 pues
1586 2018-12-08 21:13:55 Eventually, economic theory will redefine the fact that data observations in stocks do not constitute value in as much as a given temperature in a thermometer never tells the climate reality of the day
#FakeValue
1587 2018-12-08 21:11:53 Will you have a function that transfer stocks to my Revolut stock account (from my existing broker)?
1588 2018-12-08 21:10:45 I don't think he like many other remoaners understand it was an example as to where £350m could be spent instead of funding French fishermen to control our fish stocks (another example)
1589 2018-12-08 21:08:04 Mark I am from Australia can’t seem to purchase your new book or momentum masters through amazon won’t ship it to Australia. Any idea where I can purchase from
1590 2018-12-08 21:03:49 Nice SCADA screens ;)

1595 2018-12-08 20:59:53 Going to be interesting watching people being shocked as to what happens to their penny stocks during a bear market. Venture exchange was over 3200 in 2008 before the last bear market ... what will it be after the next one?
1596 2018-12-08 20:56:21 Love to seek purpose and performance from my stocks!
1597 2018-12-08 20:55:52 why is either main party negotiating anything given theyre both in EU dock and stocks it seems.
1598 2018-12-08 20:55:09 If they were stocks, they’d both be growth.
1599 2018-12-08 20:55:08 Silver lining is that now is a good time to buy stocks
1600 2018-12-08 20:54:12 Check to see how many of his "friends" owns stocks or companies that sells filters.  Always,  always,  #followthemoney
1601 2018-12-08 20:54:03 Even though I know they'll make it hurt us more than it will ever hurt them, knowing that the richest 10% own over 80% of the stocks, I can't help but smile when I see stock prices crumble. I can't help it.
1602 2018-12-08 20:53:58 So when will you ban bump stocks as you promised?
1603 2018-12-08 20:53:19 There's an easy way to prove me wrong. Just explain how current investors who are holding $34 trillion in stocks can get their money back without taking money from other investors AND without using hypothetical assumptions Good luck!

BTW, did u figure out math/logic flaw yet?
1604 2018-12-08 20:53:03 Anyone involved in stocks?

1606 2018-12-08 20:51:04 Aw ran out of stocks and wiki facts :/
1607 2018-12-08 20:51:03 Sleepily misread the ‘stocks’ app on my phone screen as ‘socks’ and pressed it thinking, hmm I do need socks.
1608 2018-12-08 20:49:41 I will always hold a small amount of crypto. I take into account the risk of it going to zero. I make my profit day trading stocks.  Not my only investment. Love your advice and inspirations Tim.
1609 2018-12-08 20:49:31 Sold everything months and months ago except for one telecommunications stock and a couple utility stocks
1610 2018-12-08 20:46:42 I think you have emissions confused with stocks, stocks went down this year....
1611 2018-12-08 20:45:29 Hey everyone, this is a very important update on my #StockMarket stuff, and I just checked my returns part of my portfolio and it looks like that my returns have risen so far to 8.8K and I believe it’s going to get even bigger over time as well.

My name in Manuel D’Ambrosi, I am interested on of your report :TABLE-Forecasts for World oil demand, supply, stocks. 2012.  May I have the report of Dec. 2017 and the report of Nov. 2018. I cannot find it

1615 2018-12-08 20:42:48 I've spent my Saturday night opening a stocks and shares ISA. 

I used to be fun.
1616 2018-12-08 20:42:45 I need friends I can talk about my stocks and bonds with  lawd knows my ass getting frustrated at these market price fluctuating so damn much. Also stash has been teaching me so much it’s crazy the information being put out lately!
1617 2018-12-08 20:42:21 The US economy is heavily dependent on rising asset values (stocks and houses) to finance consumption. Explicit policy purpose of Fed’s low interest rate policy. So the whole economy should go into reverse as rising rates create headwinds for asset values, reducing consumption.

1619 2018-12-08 20:41:29 Not had any B12 supplements for a week now and I think my stocks have run out. Forgot how horrid it is 
1620 2018-12-08 20:37:22 i cant believe you took the most stocks and it was on yourself
1621 2018-12-08 20:37:09 #WhenTrumpOpensHisMouth the #grains prices and #WallStreet stocks swing wildly. Time to ask people who know about markets like @CapitalWinston
1622 2018-12-08 20:36:49 You can start, using the Robin Hood app, with as little as $100. The goal is to keep adding new savings every month, every year. Buy stocks and index funds. Hold them 5+ years. We can help!
1623 2018-12-08 20:30:57 And what we should pay more for gas. I don't think so. But new stocks then
1624 2018-12-08 20:30:22 Gas might be down, but so are my stocks and tbh, I’d rather pay more for one then lose money on the other

1627 2018-12-08 20:29:03 hola
1628 2018-12-08 20:28:31 "Dynamic Credit Allocation Fund" one of the more frightening names to own in a rate rising, tighter credit cycle. Watch out friend! These CEF discounts are like low pe stocks, not cheap when the E goes away. Pricing transparency?
1629 2018-12-08 20:28:25 J'ai vomis et je reviens pour dire : viens on y va, il me reste un vieux stocks de fusées de détresse et d'obus de la 2eme guerre mondiale.
1630 2018-12-08 20:27:56 you know someone in smash ultimate multiplayer comes straight from smash 4's for glory because............ why would you pick 2 stocks in a 3 stock game.
1631 2018-12-08 20:25:50 I’ve played about 10 games online requesting 1v1 3 stocks on BF.  i literally haven’t had a single fucking one that wasnt an ffa,  or a 1v1 with stage hazards on.... what the actual fuck.  That and i only aee about 8 full lobbies even if I refresh.
1632 2018-12-08 20:25:47 Help! Millennials Fingered Our Blue Chip Stocks ?!
1633 2018-12-08 20:25:15 So the worsening crisis caused by these tariffs: American producers and consumers are paying the price while China continues to sell to us. Farms going bankrupt, plants shutting down, wages dropping, stocks beginning to tank. That dude's an idiot. Globalism pays the bills, dork.
1634 2018-12-08 20:24:39 Lmao 20 minutes in and it's already sold out? Hell na man. You gotta make sure you double even tripple your stocks
1635 2018-12-08 20:23:39 @realDonaldTrump lost almost $1 trillion from the value of stocks in just four days of trading. Congrats dude on besting @BarackObama in one thing at least. #TariffMan
1636 2018-12-08 20:23:39 Just sayin, as far as “value stocks” go, if u wanted to get in, it’s looking attractive in this range, no?
1637 2018-12-08 20:23:25 $spy sitting next to a guy in a coffee shop staring at his iphone stocks app with all red watchlist! I think selling hasn't even begun! $qqq $dji
1638 2018-12-08 20:22:10 Hate to say it, but this giant bubble in stocks, real estate, bonds, & pretty much everything gonna blow on Trump's watch.

The socialists will take control in 2020 because the pendulum always swings too far.

I just pray Trump takes out deep state & builds the wall before then.
1639 2018-12-08 20:21:37 Govt is looking at rolling stocks options. That is why franchise bidding is on hold till then.

1645 2018-12-08 20:17:32 This is my belief as well- It's just a shame that someone with publicity and responsibility embodies hateful qualities. Worse still that the hate and anger is hidden under the guise of "warning people". I hope more people see through the bravado

1648 2018-12-08 20:16:23 Hey @ShortSqueezed1 I’ve gotta a silly question for you, how the gold to silver ratio can affect the stock market? I thought this ratio was useful to take be bullish on silver and bearish on gold but how this affects the stocks in general? Thank you
1649 2018-12-08 20:15:58 OK
1650 2018-12-08 20:14:45 This girl hates my guts now... but I still have her stocks in my room 
1651 2018-12-08 20:14:12 A great tip of mine is to buy stocks for a good price, get spooked, sell them for a small loss or gain, ultimately watch the stocks soar after selling, and then hold onto the ones that are down 65%, because you really don’t have much more to lose at that point.
1652 2018-12-08 20:13:24 You've exceeded your allotted stock tips. Now  buy and/or sell BorgWarner Inc. $BWA #Stocks
1653 2018-12-08 20:12:36 This is great, i would love to see the contrast between something like this against those with similar draft stocks that didn't cut it...the impatience of fans with such young players are at an all time high but where is it really stemming from
1654 2018-12-08 20:10:36 What’s funny is when stocks doing good “ oh he didn’t do that” ......when it tanks.. oh now it’s “ all his fault”
1655 2018-12-08 20:10:33 That’s like me with stocks except the opposite
1656 2018-12-08 20:09:30 What percentage of assessment stocks are likely to crash is based on technicals and what percentage is based on fundamentals?  Have stocks ever crash when the Chicago Feds National Activity Index been making new highs? 84 indicators included - so very broad measurement of Economy
1657 2018-12-08 20:09:18 He made his money in the 1980s and 1990s in penny stocks and hedge funds. He does absolutely no physical work and he has about 25 people working for him as caretakers and grounds keepers and to build his orange green house etc. He’s like a little Louis the 14th.
1658 2018-12-08 20:08:16 Love this. Every short seller needs to read this. You can't short stocks if the story isn't there. You may be right, but being right can cost you a fortune.
1659 2018-12-08 20:05:01 C’est simple: Nike ne sait pas gérer des stocks
1660 2018-12-08 20:04:19 It’s not
During the 10-year bull run we can once close to being officially in bear market and I remember that day stocks soared so high ending the possibility of entering bear market 
So the definition is legit
1661 2018-12-08 20:03:27 This man should be put in stocks for a day in every town or village in the UK and we should all get a go at pelting him with whatever rotten rancid foodstuffs we can find ! #brexitshambles author
1662 2018-12-08 20:03:13 Ah!  I get it!  Sorry.  Of course, it's completely irrelevant where it is on the chart it just sort of tells you if we're closer to a bottom or a top.  It was in Panic basically from Feb 2016 through Jul 2016 and that was a great time to be in stocks.
1663 2018-12-08 20:02:55 I on record in favor of forcing a halt on all urban/high-risk air strikes, but putting a hold on US precision bombs won't do that. They have stocks for another year or more, during which time they can procure alternative  aerial munitions. Again, best to make KSA willingly stop.

1674 2018-12-08 19:52:45 LOL WHAT!!!!! Noooo... we pay 1,200!!! The rate changes daily. It’s kind of like stocks here lol. If we didn’t book our apartment by November 30 it would of went up to 1,600 the next day. It’s all computerized.
1675 2018-12-08 19:52:42 I think most assume "Cal's system is just depressing his stocks and he's been better than that" but he really doesn't do much good usually besides def rebounding.

1683 2018-12-08 19:46:51 Take it, choose whichever method I believe is best to make it grow (small business, stocks, etc), and send that shit back. Everybody's saying not to question the Lord's blessing like you can't be that blessing.
1684 2018-12-08 19:46:32 2 stocks sur 6 minutes, le tout en BO5. Sinon rien !
1685 2018-12-08 19:45:55 I have to believe that more will have the "courage" to say something if stocks continue to tank and economy begins to slow down.  Money talks faster than values - unfortunately.
1686 2018-12-08 19:45:06 (1/2) The model I like to sort of simplify the notion of what goes o­n in a market for common stocks is the pari-mutuel system at the racetrack... a pari-mutuel system is a market. Everybody goes there and bets and the odds change based o­n what's bet.

1707 2018-12-08 19:26:39 ...that justify that nervousness, I’d point to the Vegas attack and I’d mention anti-gov’t extremists, and then I’d go on my own tirade about how we can’t even ban f*cking bump stocks to protect people from anti-gov’t extremists, despite the massive shift to our society...
1708 2018-12-08 19:26:37 How does Obamacare ruin his rep?  Obama inherited a terrible economy and 2 wars. By the time he left office he saved the auto industry, and his final 6 years saw us dig out of the 08 housing and banking market crash w steady decline in unemployment. Unemployment fell&stocks 1/2
1709 2018-12-08 19:26:15 Traders create liquidity which reduces volatility.

Stocks are now more over valued than at any time before.

Major Bear Moves occur faster than Major Bull Moves. The wealthy make more money on declines than rises.  The crash isn’t an ‘accident’. It is a planned reset of prices.
1710 2018-12-08 19:26:01 How long did your good for? A few years is fairly normal (ie in stocks etc) a few months is just trying to make a quick buck. Just my opinion. A project is being developed and from what I have seen it has a bright future. I'm holding.
1711 2018-12-08 19:25:28 Much like US Dollar #fiat #currency & #markets (Stocks, bonds, commodities, ETFs, etc.) based on $USD value: if your $AMZN gains 5% vs. $USD as $USD loses value, your gains are $AMZN minus $USD.)
#cryptocurrency is ALL underpinned by $BTC; #Bitcoin is here to stay for years. 
1712 2018-12-08 19:25:19 And then I think about the policy response. Remember the social response to Charlie Hebdo? And god knows we all remember the policy response to 9/11. 

After the Vegas attack – we couldn’t even ban f*cking bump stocks!
1713 2018-12-08 19:22:57 No rational reason? Vegas would like a word with you, that lunatic killed dozens with bump stocks and injured hundreds
1714 2018-12-08 19:21:04 I know the Vegas guy had some bump stocks, but did he actually use one?
1715 2018-12-08 19:20:33 Yeah I love selecting 1v1, 3 stocks, 5 minutes only to get thrown into 6 FFAs with items consecutively
1716 2018-12-08 19:20:01 Because there are no rational reasons to ban bump stocks.

1718 2018-12-08 19:16:21 I adore luxury fashion and marvelous things, but lately I’ve been so proud of myself for watching stocks, training myself how to invest properly, educating myself on taxes, and for saving until I can purchase my dream property

1729 2018-12-08 19:10:14 And Robert, every tweet you’ve ever made is about pot stocks. That makes you one of the miscreants contributing to this Dystopian Shitshow. So go fuck yourself, please.
1730 2018-12-08 19:08:56 Hi Jakob. Thank you for your tweet.
It is hard to say, it depends on your system. I would recomend to start with a simulation account and try and build a system that works for you.for me large cap stocks work better. further more  you need to find stock in play
1731 2018-12-08 19:08:45 Now they're being out the low stocks. Lol
1732 2018-12-08 19:08:32 He is not wrong. This is an exceptional sock. The Grand Poobah of stocks, indeed.
1733 2018-12-08 19:08:12 Yes I'm well aware of bump stocks and they are illegal in maryland as they should be. I believe no one should be able to own a automatic that only belongs in war!
1734 2018-12-08 19:05:58 I agree. #EndProhibition #EndTyranny I don't want the government or pHarma in my medicine. It's just a plant. A plant that scares the government. Because it actually helps. As opposed to their pHarma stocks.
1735 2018-12-08 19:02:10 Because they leave widgets and stocks to the markets and put things that involve the welfare of human beings into the hands of actual human beings.

1739 2018-12-08 18:59:26 Anyone doubt that @realDonaldTrump sold stocks before announcing his terrible tariffs?! We need his tax returns to see if he or his family engaged in insider trading!!
1740 2018-12-08 18:59:24 A good rule of thumb is when they destroy the leader, i.e., down 80% or more.  Then they have to take the next bull market, and maybe more than one, off.  While their might be a few new names that work, overall the vast majority of the stocks in that sector should be avoided.

1748 2018-12-08 18:55:07 Not convinced tbh, his stocks lowering this season so far, don’t think he’d leave unless he had a decent offer. (Waiver notice, that doesn’t mean I want him gone before anyone shouts at me)
1749 2018-12-08 18:55:04 You forget despite the stocks dropping is that they are still higher than ever before. Clinton spending would have been even worse as well

1754 2018-12-08 18:52:17 So bump stocks should be legal?
1755 2018-12-08 18:51:33 This is great.
"Legislators and top staff trade in stocks while making decisions affecting their value."

1756 2018-12-08 18:48:22 The writer is inexperienced. DOW is at low of year most popular FANG stocks down 40%. The wealth effect means people spend less on major items like homes. Sellers should hustle and get on market. If no recovery everything gets worse faster.

1781 2018-12-08 18:29:48 I stayed away from giving opinions on price targets and valuations of this company. I don't advise investors to buy or sell stocks.

We can’t touch them until they recuperate back.  They say to stick it out long term and hope for a different future.

1786 2018-12-08 18:26:39 Stocks and bonds are where I would start, and then I’d use some of the additional growth I would have experienced to fund acquisition of real estate that I could convert into passive income through a combination of house hacking and the BRRRR method.

1791 2018-12-08 18:23:18 My stocks says otherwise
1792 2018-12-08 18:23:18 I doubt it.

I doubt it because Donald Trump doesn't buy stocks. He doesn't understand how the market works and he doesn't see the value of investment, because it's putting money into something.

His whole deal is getting people to "invest" in him, then living off that money.
1793 2018-12-08 18:22:43 That would be bad for the country they’re one of the biggest industries who bring in a lot of money pretty much every American owns stocks in the gun industry
1794 2018-12-08 18:22:33 Its pretty awesome when you have a hand in getting the ball rolling in your direction too lol. This would never fly in traditional assets /stocks as their would be shareholder suits against Charlie Lee for sure.

1796 2018-12-08 18:17:22 And he's probably buying stocks right now since he has such faith in the tanking economy.

1801 2018-12-08 18:14:36 some people are trying to buy enough stocks so they could give exo's creative freedom, etc (like elfs did to suju)... the thing about boycotting and stop buying stuff is that it hurts exo too, so majority of us is reluctant abt doing such a thing

1803 2018-12-08 18:12:33 You act like is a crime to have to present ID to vote to help prevent voter fraud when you have to present an ID for things way less important than voting.

1806 2018-12-08 18:10:44 Anyone doubt that @realDonaldTrump sold stocks before announcing his terrible tariffs?! We need his tax returns to see if he or his family engaged in insider trading!!
1807 2018-12-08 18:10:42 Anyone doubt that @realDonaldTrump sold stocks before announcing his terrible tariffs?! We need his tax returns to see if he or his family engaged in insider trading!!
1808 2018-12-08 18:10:30 Yeah, that's true!  It was like a light switch turning on, the majority of pot stocks starting going up up up.
1809 2018-12-08 18:10:26 It’s infuriating. Congress should decry the crisis of sex trafficking and offer these women the assistance and opportunities of “rehabilitation” like they’ve decried the opioid crisis.

1811 2018-12-08 18:09:01 #Bitcoin is the love child of artificially low interest rates & speculative investing. When reality didn't suit their narrative, "Global Warmers" became "Climate Changers", the same way, "You can use #bitcoin to buy a cup of coffee", became, "It's an asset class, like stocks".
1812 2018-12-08 18:08:29 Gold has almost no intrinsic value. The asset bubbles affect assets that has values. Like housing, stocks and commodities.
1813 2018-12-08 18:07:17 Sweet. With interest rates historically low here, I've kept my $ in stocks. Maybe time to rethink
1814 2018-12-08 18:05:53 FYI all penny stocks say they are looking for non-dilutive funding. But why would they? Why pay back a loan with your own money when you can easily do it with shareholder money and keep more company profits in your own pockets? These are just my thoughts on the matter.
1815 2018-12-08 18:05:37 They say it is part of a normal and strong economy for stocks to produce the dynamics this way.

1830 2018-12-08 17:49:38 As @LMT978 always says, not a prediction just an observation but hard to make a bullish case from technical analysis, as well as trade war, yield curve, low oil, slowing Apple sales, global stocks in bear market, brexit worries, 8 year uptrend getting old.

1838 2018-12-08 17:42:11 1/1 The one dimensional buy and never sell strategy is cute when stock prices rise. But when stocks fall and you’re withdrawing 3 to 6% of your portfolio for #retirement income, the risk for running out of money substantially jumps.

1864 2018-12-08 17:20:52 HAPPY ANNIVERSARY, YOU TWO  May you continue to love and support one another to uphold this poetic persistence and patience, even as you suplex one another~! Your stocks or time are never misplaced in each other! Congrats!! 
1865 2018-12-08 17:20:49 So, tell us what it means in terms of stocks etc., I'm not an expert like all of you.
1866 2018-12-08 17:19:23 Notice dumpster fire @POTUS #littlefuhrert has gone silent. Debt worse and wosening under him & @GOP . Stocks lost all of 2018 and nearing level when he took office. Jobs going down and economy sliding. China and Mueller getting ready for pouncing.
1867 2018-12-08 17:18:31 The USA has never won in a war against insurgents. And there are 100M gun owners with over 300M guns, a trillion rounds of ammunition, and 500K “known” bump stocks in circulation. It would be one hell of an insurgency. It’s the only thing that keeps them in check.
1868 2018-12-08 17:18:19 Celine, lives on Saddleridge Drive with 2 kids.

Put all their savings into maca root stocks. Can't retire.
1869 2018-12-08 17:17:21 it's the # of stocks that are making new lows on the NYSE. Mine is only common stocks, Walter's is ALL stocks or really everything that trades at the NYSE like preferreds and bond funds
1870 2018-12-08 17:16:16 Very fascinating. From 2016 so I would think it would probably be higher now for each category as $cannabis stocks are still up quite a lot from that time. 2017 was probably the biggest year by far with 2018 looking down but hoping for the Holiday run!
1871 2018-12-08 17:14:46 Two: 2001 & 2008. Scared the hell out of me. But, I know 2019 is the BIG one. Brace myself and go long with mutual funds (I am not good enough to buy individual stocks)
1872 2018-12-08 17:13:32 Alright my only gripe in Ultimate is that you can't exit an online match while you're waiting (fighting the cpu) or when you've lost all your stocks. You're forced to wait unless you exit the game
1873 2018-12-08 17:12:41 Dan, I remember well in 1990 selling my bank stocks close to the low and watching them go up min 20X over next several years.  #Bitcoin will be much better. Spend more time learning about lightning.  I only own @bitcoin.

Hello r/Stock_Picks,

I am fairly new to investing so to just play around I opened a Robinhood account and bough 9 penny stocks about $0.81 a share. The trade was back in April 2018. Then I totally forgot about it. Today I open…

1893 2018-12-08 16:59:28 Probably this is because manipulation. @jono_t2000 told me that on metals stocks and fx patterns actually work, maybe because they are bigger markets and it's more difficult to manipulate the price

1901 2018-12-08 16:55:50 .. when i trade the open i trade the cheaper stocks, so more share size, i think i could offset the profit split by cheaper comms
1902 2018-12-08 16:55:06 count on it. analysts talk about 'death lines' in stocks as 20-day averages cross 1-year average, but ignore price of lumber, labor, and interest rates crossing sales in real estate. a 2x4 is still $3 per. As it was when houses peaked, but demand is dropping. no gonna last..
1903 2018-12-08 16:54:53 It could be a horrible cleansing with a much brighter future, 80% of stocks owned by top 10%, they will feel it bigly.
1904 2018-12-08 16:54:16 Besides, there was no real reason for the recent climb in prices anyway.  The companies weren't worth more, just the prices went up on stocks - it was an illusion.  It had to correct sooner or later.
1905 2018-12-08 16:53:48 You have much to learn friend.

1925 2018-12-08 16:45:27 Watched #AssaultOnwallstreet on @NetflixIndia . Loved the ending, nothing is fair in the game of shares and stocks. Male lead - Dominic Purcell, Brilliant acting , especially at the climax.
1926 2018-12-08 16:44:37 % asset breakdown in your “core” retirement accounts?  Bonds/stocks etc
1927 2018-12-08 16:44:23 Writers/Editors of rubbish like this should be put into the village stocks, and pilloried - most publicly.
1928 2018-12-08 16:43:37 $PVTL is like $ZUO $YEXT . Near lows . There are some other software-cloud SaaS companies that have had better performance this year like $TWLO $OKTA $MDB. This sector has some stocks near 52 week highs and some 52 weeks lows . $PVTL is near lows ....
1929 2018-12-08 16:43:12 Point taken. 
The only way I ever counter trend is when I see potential for full reversal on maximum extensions, or what I can best perceive as such. I’m also a futures only trader. For some reasons I have more intuition regarding them. I tried strictly stocks once.

1931 2018-12-08 16:41:08 Another sign is Tesla strength. Darlings / cult stocks failing is often a good sign too
1932 2018-12-08 16:38:32 It’s too difficult to keep up with what intersects with what these days, you know. But I’m quite certain someone in the New Puritan brigade shall eventually wind up in the stocks for this.
1933 2018-12-08 16:38:15 You mean the stock price? I am getting burned from their stocks. Evan Spiegal needs to do something. I think he needs to start by restructuring his company.
1934 2018-12-08 16:38:04 Can’t wait to see the inevitable fall of companies hailed as tech innovators - but simply an app provider. How many years of losses are we at now, 8? 

I fear for people who buy these stocks.
1935 2018-12-08 16:37:46 All this year people were screaming “growth unsustainable” “stocks way overvalued” “market needs a pullback (reality check)”. - then you get what you ask for and it’s Henny Penny everywhere screaming  “ the sky is falling!”

Get some perspective people, jeez.
1936 2018-12-08 16:37:05 Great report portraying nice self reflection skills!
What stocks do you recommend to trade for Beginners? Microcaps or bluechips rather?
1937 2018-12-08 16:36:36 Crypto isn't stocks, so options trading isn't as risky. I don't think anything you've done in the past is comparable to crypto. 

Also, margin debt is the highest it's been since the great depression...so there's lots of people like you. Overconfident. Just saying mane.
1938 2018-12-08 16:36:32 Would you consider non traditional assets or just stocks and bonds? Seems most of the responses here are focused on equity exposure
1939 2018-12-08 16:36:28 Made my 6 bagger in KRC and totally got out. Currently holding a position only in SRN:ASX based on M Cap /Resources  ratio. 
AVL, KRC etc charts not looking good ( SPs below 200 DEMA). It is a global bear market next year, Energy stocks may not do well at all.
1940 2018-12-08 16:35:59 Hm, would you go into any non-traditional assets? It seems everyone is concerned with stocks/bonds, just curious
1941 2018-12-08 16:35:42 @SenFeinstein #Mueller #Trump Is there any way to see if the president sold any stocks this week (knowing outcome of Cohen/Manafort tell alls )having "Insider Trading" info? Even Baron's account.

1946 2018-12-08 16:32:42 Nice one...like yourself..i have followed sub £20mln cap AIM stocks for many years...are u invested in both now?
1947 2018-12-08 16:32:25 Iran exports were cut in half in less than a year. I agree in that waivers are more important to sentiment not supply. Until then, market will start to see bullish data on falling crude stocks &  lower production figures. April will be nuts with waiver deadline and OPEC meeting.
1948 2018-12-08 16:32:20 This online is so fucking dogshit. How do i get into a game where its 4 player ffa with items on and no stocks.
1949 2018-12-08 16:31:51 I think given how much the FANG stocks now represent the Naz and S%P, until they stop going down, the market is not done going down.  A/D line loses validity.
1950 2018-12-08 16:31:46 @patternshifter @OldFngGuy @unsure12 for all my analyzing of stocks, and so on.
1951 2018-12-08 16:31:08 But you see, I don’t agree with a ban on bump stocks - for the same reason I just tweeted a warning about the elite civil war going on right now. When it spills over onto us, you will want something for self defense. Eh? Unless you are foolish enough to believe ANY of them.
1952 2018-12-08 16:30:55 Have a very large amount of cash to invest in stocks. Waiting for next year expecting a 15% decline from here (s&p 2633 Dec 8, 2018).
1953 2018-12-08 16:30:28 Deepak said the same thing. An election doesn’t affect the overall market. A couple stocks yes maybe. But India on a whole will grow whoever rules it.

Sir, This question is for long term(5-10 years). Which mid-cap/small cap stocks can be considered for slow accumulation? Is this the right time to start? Or should I wait for any correction?
1956 2018-12-08 16:29:56 Actually I was thinking stocks - and LOTS of rotten tomatoes ...
1957 2018-12-08 16:29:30 Stocks go down with 5% 

Investors be like ‘oh no I am losing everything’

Crypto goes down with 90% 

Investors be like  ‘hodl’
1958 2018-12-08 16:28:11 It's a very big risk. They don't even tell retail investors to leverage trade with stocks and you're really risking capital shorting crypto.
1959 2018-12-08 16:27:49 I was very, very bearish and warned loudly about complacency-- in August, September and prior, due to same issues that are manifesting now.  

I don't disagree with picking up long term tax loss value stocks.
1960 2018-12-08 16:27:38 Pulled my stocks out about two weeks ago. I am retiring in a few years and won't have time to 'debuild' like I did in the last crash.
1961 2018-12-08 16:26:00 I may have to, Everything tanked this week, even bonds. At least When my stocks are down, my bonds are up and vise versa. Usually. But EVERYTHING went down substantially. Trying not to panick and might see what this week brings. 
1962 2018-12-08 16:25:54 Or was it the plan to fix our fisheries that involved asking our own Govt to allow our own fisheries stocks to our own fleets?
1963 2018-12-08 16:25:46 @nixdulay way too many stocks for everyone. don’t fret if you’re not able to cop them today. 
1964 2018-12-08 16:24:00 @nixdulay plenty of stocks everywhere
1965 2018-12-08 16:23:31 For professionals less is more. They trade for life in only 5-6 stocks. In fact in 2008 I met a trader who traded in 2 stocks day in day out. They don't use too many technical indicators, infact they master 1 or 2 only. They seldom track more than 3 macro variables. Simple.
1966 2018-12-08 16:23:26 Have you been watching the #Vanadium stocks? One of the best performing minerals of the year.
1967 2018-12-08 16:22:34 The corps spent about a Trillion Dollars buying back their stocks - the most ever. Can any R explain how that benefited the American people? And the joke of it is they even acknowledged that was what they were going to do w/ their windfall even before R's pushed law thru.
1968 2018-12-08 16:22:17 We have no public option but do have subsidies.

Insurance stocks soared when ours passed. Telltale, that.

I used to blog over at @eurotribune & recall hearing about the French system. I was very impressed.

1978 2018-12-08 16:12:11 I don’t think people realize what an outlier LDI/MGP has been. Finding a bulk supplier just sitting on aging stocks means that their business plan had gone tits up and it’s nearly miraculous that it worked out for them.

2002 2018-12-08 15:56:07 Yes, as in just like what happened with ZRX when it was listed. For the most part though- No. it’ll drop back down to consolidate before beginning its climb through EOY.

2006 2018-12-08 15:53:26 The fact is that Ocasio is a lightweight freshman congresswoman who can only do as much damage as Pelosi allows. On the other hand a dumb statement by old Orange Blossom can result in anything from stocks dropping to a war. So I will continue to make the comparison.

2013 2018-12-08 15:48:21 Something the media won’t tell U = Relative value correction.   We are sitting on a notable relative correction now.  Price decline + Growth equates to a roughly 35% decline in total valuation.  That’s biggest since 2016 low.  It’s much larger in my preferred universe of stocks
2014 2018-12-08 15:48:14 Trading common is better than playing options if you are new to it. If you are playing naked calls, unlimited risk potential. Using options for protecting stocks is a common strategy that many experienced traders do.

2018 2018-12-08 15:44:37 I think in that case it is more likely the options sellers who are covering that is causing the spike in VIX - like a short squeeze in stocks. You can see this evidence in VXX going parabolic on huge volume.  Big shorts getting out at their levels.

2031 2018-12-08 15:35:34 @TeamCavuto @dagenmcdowell Dagen, the fall in the stocks is only partly due to the investigation. The MAIN fall is because @DNC is taking over the house and the @GOP has no juevos to stand against them with Paul @SpeakerRyan in there cowtowing to them so he can be liked by press.

2039 2018-12-08 15:32:38 @jimcramer Booyah Jim, Bonds and savings accts are still getting unreasonably low rates. Since the S&P hit record high in Oct, why not let rates rise? Why do you insist that the only yield that investors are allowed to get should be from volatile and risky assets like stocks?
2040 2018-12-08 15:32:20 Do you understand how the stock market works? 

When the stock market drops, it is because of people selling their stocks to make money. They don’t want to risk anymore of their shares. 

Stock market will go back up and drop again.

The stock marking has a ceiling.

2046 2018-12-08 15:28:54 Just in case you were wondering what former conservative GOP speaker of the house John Boehner is currently doing, he is hosting the American Cannabis Summit where he will advise you which cannabis stocks are about to take off!
2047 2018-12-08 15:27:46 @realDonaldTrump Stocks dropped sharply on Friday on Wall Street. A weaker-than-expected jobs report and China-U.S. trade tensions sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average lower by 558.72 points to 24,388.95 and ERASED IT'S GAINS FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR.

You can't do anything right.
2048 2018-12-08 15:26:33 Hopefully my weed stocks when up and use it to go long 25x!
2049 2018-12-08 15:25:38 With the inevitable downturn coming in the next year or two, I'd definitely be more conservative, with a 60/40 or 70/30 stock/bond allocation.  My current allocation is probably 80 to 90 stocks/ 20 to 10 bonds .  

Or maybe I wouldn't buy any at all and just wait it out?
2050 2018-12-08 15:25:13 Big difference is that now everyone has stocks, 401K's, not to mention the extreme systemic leverage..compared to early 1970's.

This will hit everyone.

Sure, will be buying op at some point..
2051 2018-12-08 15:25:09 US stocks trade 6.5 hours a day, 5 days a week. Bitcoin trades 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. I don't think that chart or comparison is even valid. In the course of a year $BTC will trade 4x more that the US stock market. How can you use that time frame to compare?

"Actions tell the truth"

They certainly do. 

"our country is successful more than it has been in decades." 

Tell that to my stocks. 

"Don't hold him back"

2078 2018-12-08 15:01:14 Instead, I would ask how can an investor perform using the right asset allocation mix over the coming years — even if capital markets such as US stocks & bonds correct from excessive valuations (priced to deliver NOTHING significant over coming years)?
2079 2018-12-08 15:01:00 Squid bagging is completely different.  You’re choosing to showboat rather than actually play the game.  Taunting in Smash happens during downtime between stocks.

Heck, I get way more annoyed when I see my own teammates squidbagging than I ever do when it’s done to me.
2080 2018-12-08 15:00:50 That's DOWN nearly 100,000 this month from where it should be. Markets are falling like a Brick cause Trump LIED about securing China Trade! 14,800 jobs LOST by GM!

2085 2018-12-08 14:56:56 @realDonaldTrump  doesn't care how the stock market performs, it's now lower than when he took office, his silence on this bloodbath inflicted by tariffs on the world is deafening. Every time he verbally ranted on twitter about a company stocks fell big time.
2086 2018-12-08 14:55:43 Next week is not going tone bullish as many ppl r expecting. Save profits n stay away from high volatile stocks
2087 2018-12-08 14:55:32 Slowing growth and inflation could mean positive things for bonds, low volatility stocks, and value equities.
2088 2018-12-08 14:54:00 Tell the whole story- Republican Senate continues to refuse to enact common sense gun laws bc they are beholden to the @nra. We want universal background checks, mandatory waiting periods, ban on bump stocks to get started.

2097 2018-12-08 14:49:41 And YOU and your colleagues missed many more by failing to pass sensible gun regulations for all these years. 

You couldn't even ban bump stocks after the Last Vegas massacre.

2104 2018-12-08 14:43:48 I don’t think things are ever technically mispriced but I do think lots of stocks are very undervalued.  Being a “stock-picker” and liking “stocks for the long run” has never been easy despite the sentiment that prevails on the extremes.
2105 2018-12-08 14:43:46 Always be considerate. Second picture is in bad taste as it makes innocent senior citizens laughing stocks.
Why subject them to mockery?

2107 2018-12-08 14:42:24 Stocks were way overvalued. There is no way the market could sustain those values. We are now back in normal territory.

Meanwhile, there is plenty of perma bulls that are still bullish and see this as a correction cuz stocks always go up. Doesn't mean we can't bounce to reset a little.

2141 2018-12-08 14:19:40 this is what happens when corporations use the massive tax breaks to buy back their own stocks - there is a harsh lesson here necessary for market survival - corporations will lose more than the people
2142 2018-12-08 14:18:20 "Time to buy, stocks are on sale!" That's a common phrase in my office when the market tanks and this is no different.
2143 2018-12-08 14:18:04 I answered ur question if u can read through. Further 10 k can happen or not . It’s a IF. Also u don’t buy market u buy stocks and the story behind it. So if price is right we should go for it.  Do sip investment.

2151 2018-12-08 14:10:23 Respectfully, I'm reading a fair amount of arguing with the market, particularly on the most popular and heavily weighted stocks like $AAPL that the pricing is irrational.  

It isn't.
2152 2018-12-08 14:10:18 You’d like that “stop it” to happen! Emoluments clause, my ass! If you use that on Trump Industries, you could use it on any President who ever owned stocks. Should he have put everything in a blind trust? Yes. But, by your logic they still could have gotten him unless he...

2159 2018-12-08 14:06:27 We feel it is fair because it gives a chance to those that have no chance of getting tickets though even we dont always manage it. The margin that is attempted to be made is the same principle as with stocks & shares,its all a risk & needs to be a calculated using risk models

Trying to stay positive...
2175 2018-12-08 13:56:31 I am already all in. I don’t want to sell my Tesla to buy more Tesla stocks :)
2176 2018-12-08 13:52:49 À ce rythme de lacrymo jeter, dans 2/3 weekend la @PoliceNationale (et notamment l’agent Robert @La_Pollice) auront plus de stocks. N’oublions pas qu’on est pas un grand pays et qu’on a pas un stock illimité !
2177 2018-12-08 13:51:05 Record breaking deficits and companies fleeing to Mexico and China. 15,000 jobs lost from GM alone.  Yeah, when do we start winning? Stocks tanked this year.
2178 2018-12-08 13:51:04 He was trying to manipulate stocks this week while the market fell by tweeting. @jpmorgan had to issue a memo to investors that his tweets were lies.
2179 2018-12-08 13:50:59 It's Christmas time. Plenty of stocks on sale !
2180 2018-12-08 13:50:09 You control what asset class you invest your money in and whether you choose stocks, bonds, REITs, CDs and so on. Whatever you choose, the key is diversification.

Make sure you stay diverse with your investment strategy and adjust your risk according to your comfort level.
2181 2018-12-08 13:50:00 PS, selling stocks would not appear on for returns as it's considered an asset.
2182 2018-12-08 13:49:41 What about  @squiremining stocks?
2183 2018-12-08 13:49:30 The taxes are coming regardless, why support environmental demise to feed the big corps. @fordnation will eliminate middle class. Two tier society, elite & poor. Which side of the fence are you on. We lose, why lose our environment- no economics there. Look to stocks - mini-trump
2184 2018-12-08 13:49:18 Saturday sermon, as it applies to stocks, companies involved in alleged fraud, politics and increasingly much of life itself, courtesy of the great @paulsimonmusic: "All lies and jest, still a man hears what he wants to hear. And disregards the rest…”

Enjoy the weekend!
2185 2018-12-08 13:48:34 will you not have these in stocks in Cebu?
2186 2018-12-08 13:48:16 Would you give interbank rates when buying US stocks? What about ISA?
2187 2018-12-08 13:48:11 First of all, when wasn’t the Paul’s laughing stocks? 

My idea of being hit is when your channel takes a blow, a bit like when a smaller channel loses a bigger number of subs and their views takes a dump
2188 2018-12-08 13:47:58 only stocks that look like they are going higher so far are miners, and I am not talking Bitcoin
2189 2018-12-08 13:47:35 Bah je vois surtout pas trop ce que ça va changer, les gens ils ont de l'alcool dans leur frigo et leurs armoires ils vont taper dans leur stocks de bière et c'est tout
2190 2018-12-08 13:46:42 Please show me what he as done. The economy, is not his doing. America as always been great. Look at the wall street stocks plugging this week 1000 point worse since 2011, watch out in about 8 months stocks is going to get worse.
2191 2018-12-08 13:46:35 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to treat your chronic fatigue
2192 2018-12-08 13:46:24 Really?  A few headlines today.  “Oil prices jump”, “stocks plummet”, “jobs below expectations”, “off course on warming planet”, “Cohen was in touch with Russian who offered to help Trump campaign”.  What a great leader you are.....

2195 2018-12-08 13:44:47 The cost was recouped from Pasha Manafort's asset forfeitures. The Mueller probe is paying for itself while you cost us billions, topped by $1 trillion lost in stocks this week alone. #DonTheCon #Dotard
2196 2018-12-08 13:44:34 Bring back the stocks. Jumped up little shits.
2197 2018-12-08 13:43:23 Thanks GYM.  Very interesting.  I added a little bit of cash to MO recently on the stocks weakness.  It's still my largest holding, so I don't want to over do it.  Have been meaning to send you an email to exchange some thoughts on blogging. And thanks for all the pins!

2200 2018-12-08 13:42:47 I like only #Marijuana Stocks and $TSLA as my longs.  Pair them with some shorts like $BABA, $MELI, $AMZN, net you should do fine.   Mkt turned ugly Friday on decent news, so that is a bad sign for days ahead.  $SPY, $IWM, $QQQ .  Weekly Charts going to look Bad

2202 2018-12-08 13:40:29 Those on the street are being locked up due to arcane laws of the Fed and State Govt. Being able to purchase stocks of this companies is no different than purchasing Pharma Cos stocks.
2203 2018-12-08 13:38:57 If you have the time and your stocks aren’t completely speculative...HANG ON!!
2204 2018-12-08 13:38:51 Anyone doubt that @realDonaldTrump sold stocks before announcing his terrible tariffs?! We need his tax returns to see if he or his family engaged in insider trading!!

2216 2018-12-08 13:29:32 Personally I wouldn't compare CBD now to Canada's October legalization for already run weed stocks. I think now in the U.S. for CBD is more like when Canada first announced weed legalization back in 2015 or 2016,  prior to massive run ups in the weed stocks.
2217 2018-12-08 13:28:43 My husband lost everything in the market shudder back in the 80's not sure how the retirement funds lost so much and the wall street made so much but it's always the middle class that lose while the rich just buy up the stocks cheap and the market recovers with them making more.
2218 2018-12-08 13:28:31 @ZeeBusiness NBCC @59 total 130 stocks.. slowly accumulating the stock..looking for long term .. is it having the potential to become L&T, if not a good stock then please let me know the alternative..

2221 2018-12-08 13:26:35 Ultimately, it is fairness we need! Retailers should be allowed to sue distributors and suppliers for out of stocks. It isn’t fair for them to have bare shelves. WHO IS THINKING OF THE MERCHANDISERS?!?!?
2222 2018-12-08 13:25:47 Dear Liberal Yahoo Finance, with stock buybacks like this one, there are more buyers than previously of corporate stocks, this will eventually drive prices higher. Supply and demand is real, the socialist economy you seek is not real and would do great harm to our country. #MAGA
2223 2018-12-08 13:25:39 This will be why the USD Collapses btw stocks are already declining because the Bubble only got bigger and what happens when FEDs raise rates? Down like a house of cards!
2224 2018-12-08 13:24:55 Does anyone know about regular December sell offs to prepare for the New Year? Geez Dow is still over 24K.  Great time to buy great stocks at discount prices.
2225 2018-12-08 13:24:40 Oh crap...
There go the stocks again.
2226 2018-12-08 13:23:38 @Vodacom111 why is Vodacom black Friday and cyber Monday hoax and scams not trending? When you order online while stocks are available they offer alternatives @hellopetercom @idea_cares @AdvBarryRouxs @CyrilRamaphosa

2230 2018-12-08 13:22:38 The stock market ended the week because of tech stocks after an incident with tech in China.

NAFTA at work.
2231 2018-12-08 13:22:36 Thank Trump his insane inconsistent policies his insane behaviors and criminality and #Tariffs and watch our economy tank!

 #stocks that so many in our aging  population rely on to live if they tank we are in deep deep trouble and the average Trump supporter is in a bread line
2232 2018-12-08 13:21:40 i told my sister i want ly:answer for christmas bc asda stocks it now, i bet any money she picked up the same version i already have 
2233 2018-12-08 13:21:08 Seemingly not. But a new factor has been introduced. The massive losses in stocks. Congress may very well conclude that enough is enough.
2234 2018-12-08 13:20:41 Our index is very easy to manage and thats been the case since Jan this year. I actually had an analysis around june july how high weightage stocks have had super performance to keep propping our index. Again thats been the case to help us not get toasted.
2235 2018-12-08 13:20:09 Please, share my Twitter with your friends so that we can get more stocks for the analysis @thinkervenu
2236 2018-12-08 13:20:05 “individual investors are significantly more likely to buy stocks in a given industry if other investors who live within a 50-mile radius are also buying.”

Fascinating.
2237 2018-12-08 13:19:54 Up talking stocks....
2238 2018-12-08 13:19:44 It can, but i tend NOT to go long in stocks trading below 10EMA which is at 108.40... so i would avoid
2239 2018-12-08 13:19:23 We need to start measuring finance into dirty energies and measure the retirement of old capital stocks in addition to the flows of climate finance says @bodnarclimate of @RockyMtnInst at #COP24 on mobilizing climate-aligned investment #ClimateFinance #MNCOP24
2240 2018-12-08 13:18:31 China stocks are where you want to be look at ntes chart, baba, sina etc
2241 2018-12-08 13:17:45 Yeah im sure fallout merch stocks are almost over with soo much demand. /s
2242 2018-12-08 13:16:51 Before calling names look at the facts.  Stock market flat in 2018 despite the tax cut which corporations used to buy back their stocks, raising market & their profits (not helping economy) Suger rush is over AND market increased faster worldwide and under President Obama. Facts.
2243 2018-12-08 13:15:13 "5. Morgan Creek bets $1M on crypto over stocks for next decade"

@APompliano tweets it like it was someone else who made the bet
2244 2018-12-08 13:14:04 By the time you are 80, you have enough money pouring in from stocks, hedge funds & GPF that you realise everyone ‘cares’..
.
.
.
Only about the money accumulated, people are not going to change, thereby they don’t care about you anyways..


2245 2018-12-08 13:11:41 Each player will start with a traditional 50 stocks, or 'lives',
2246 2018-12-08 13:11:08 Whn ur down 40% like I said earlier u just can't make positional portfolio changes only thg one can do is to check for dud stocks in ones portfolio and exit thm.I dnt hold any dud/foreseeable penny ones& if I churn ma of now I will loose20% in the new ones I'm anyway in 20% cash
2247 2018-12-08 13:11:01 They keep chasing a luxury audience, like the other place that only stocks diet canned fruit, and completely failing to provide staple groceries. And so the ShopRite looms large in front of the mall, the only grocery store that reliably stocks the food folks are used to.
2248 2018-12-08 13:10:49 (3) Gas prices are down as oil has dropped from $75 to $50s in last month. (4) Stock market is down but bottom 80% only owns about 7% of stocks, top 20% owns 93% so I wonder how much our neighbors in NY-8 have benefited from the market’s rise last 10 years...
2249 2018-12-08 13:09:53 You still stupid? Obviously  How much did you throw away to the rich? What did you do with tarriffs? How about those stocks?  Mueller is almost done and we will see the whole outcome. I don't think he is going for collusion...you are the one that keeps harping on that.
2250 2018-12-08 13:09:45 Will stocks ever go up again?

YES
2251 2018-12-08 13:09:41 YOU WISH!!! Nobody is taking or believing your crap any longer. Your house of cards is crumbling all around you. Stocks, jobs, exports, higher deficits, consumer confidence, world respect etc etc. All coming down like a burning falling star. You are a con man and it is showing FU
2252 2018-12-08 13:09:15 For the people worried about the matchmaking, VIP games solve a part of the problem. So far I played only in 1v1 and without items. The problem is : It's not because your preference is set on 3 stocks 7m that it means you'll only play in this format. I had some 2stocks 6min games
2253 2018-12-08 13:09:06 This week in crypto:

1. @binance released DEX demo
2. @coinbase to add 30 new tokens
3. @ConsenSys lays off 13% of staff
4. @Poloniex has institutional trading
5. Morgan Creek bets $1M on crypto over stocks for next decade

Onwards!
2254 2018-12-08 13:08:15 When one starts working for a government, he/she is not taxed on gains for selling his/her stocks (which he/has to do). I believe it is the only reason Tillerson worked for Trumbo.
2255 2018-12-08 13:07:30 Hooray!!! 
We decided to welcome 12.12 earlier for 2018...
Promo starts 09/12 ends 16/12.. while stocks last.. Will replenish when got free spaces.. heeee
2256 2018-12-08 13:07:15 The stocks will come back and the NEW DOJ will have Hillary’s whole Bullshit investigated wait!! We the people have voted and 2 states don’t make a President!! TRUMP 2020 
2257 2018-12-08 13:06:49 Powell spoke but why were US stocks and oil making new highs early Oct after multiple hikes, sagging global econ data, tariffs, etc?  Like $100 oil with massive fracking,  markets irrational longer than logic can stay solvent.
2258 2018-12-08 13:06:18 Stocks still up 7000 since election of Trump get a real job Michelangelo 
2259 2018-12-08 13:06:03 ano ba yan, ang bilis maubos ng stocks ng 23:11 :<
2260 2018-12-08 13:05:29 If you short stocks in a market correction you not only have to time that trade out but also must time when to go long again. If your in cash you only have to be right once, when to get back in.
2261 2018-12-08 13:04:33 U say investors made money since we r talking history here tke an hour out search the old bse data base for the nifty 500 stocks list of 2008 frgt 2008 take the jan 2007 and simply find out hw many still quote @ atleast10% of their  2007 prices ....(50% r down 80%or more)
2262 2018-12-08 13:02:59 Just seems someone wanted to sell huge quantity of other banks stocks so this news was planted in the market
2263 2018-12-08 13:02:16 While @realDonaldTrump is most likely “Individual #1” & guilty of countless crimes, almost $1 trillion dollars has been wiped from the value of stocks in just 4 days of trading.
This has been one of the worst weeks for the Trump’s presidency since he stole the election in 2016!
2264 2018-12-08 13:00:21 I wsnt event referring to leveraged traders I ws referring to the avg liquid investors who invest in mid/sml caps who bought stocks @20x p/e bt tday r trading @10/11x I'm hvnt evn included investors who lost money in shady/junk/ stocks with deepCorp governance issues
2265 2018-12-08 13:00:05 Order now while we still have stocks! We might not restock this item when it runs out 
2266 2018-12-08 12:57:46 I live in an area where 4/5 grocery stores have closed, moved, or changed ownership in the past few years. Can we talk about the way they're all trying to pursue luxury upscale customers that don't really exist? And also the one that only stocks SF Very Cherry fruit cocktail. WTF
2267 2018-12-08 12:56:51 Mood ko bumili ng stocks ng ABS-CBN tapos maging board member then pilitin sila na ayusin yung handling sa mnl48
2268 2018-12-08 12:56:17 Stocks are negative for 2018, wiping out any growth they made. And “full employment” is not a metric of success when the jobs pay so little that you need more than one and they are so transitory that they might be exported at any moment.
2269 2018-12-08 12:55:59 entire thesis being the fall wnt be a 1 day /a two day event it will ATLEASt last a fortnight with a 20% cut in most stocks whle the markets falling 10/15% to atlest 9,500 I HOPE & PRAY THT I'm wrong bt this is  the reality...
2270 2018-12-08 12:55:17 Get ready for $BTC to hit 0 boys! Time to get out of your basement and get a job, and quit with the get-rich-quick schemes(yes stop with the penny stocks too ) #cryptocurrency #crypto
2271 2018-12-08 12:52:01 ...and I won't even try to make light of that :-) 

Our little @mpi_astro_bib stocks some choice Irish authors as well. John Lighton Synge comes to mind, with a *very* good book on general relativity.
2272 2018-12-08 12:51:46 @jeffsnguyen @Moench no really. 20 years in the business. Yesterday was one of the easiest days to trade. Apparently you just own stocks
2273 2018-12-08 12:50:12 @Darty_Officiel vous êtes vraiment des incompétents ya rien d'autre a dire quand ça fait 2 semaine que vous attendez votre livraison et quand vous appeler le sav marre d'attendre on vous dit "rupture de stocks jusqu'à la fin du mois"
2274 2018-12-08 12:46:58 yung makita ule sila, yie char HAHAHA. (sana HAHAHA)

SVT perfumezzz, dami di nakahabol eh :((. Eh gustong gusto nila yunnn. So more stocks!! Hihi.

2275 2018-12-08 12:46:24 Long term investing has worked out pretty well for Buffett, dips and recessions are great buying opportunities be it for indexes or individual stocks
2276 2018-12-08 12:46:17 Uploading new stocks Po 
2277 2018-12-08 12:46:13 Stocks are worrying about 9 months from now when consumer Debt could start to implode and political incertainty.  Plus, the Fed might have to reconsider policy.....
2278 2018-12-08 12:44:17 Indices are a total joke . As rev says many stocks down 20 to 40 pc..autos..housing..oil names..materials..tech...when aal goes down 15 pc in a week on absolutely nothing except second rate shp d/ g for no reason either ..u know algos have gone nuts and taken control
2279 2018-12-08 12:44:12 SPIKER COMBINE stocks climb despite troubling geopolitical headlines
2280 2018-12-08 12:42:32 Di ko alam kung matatawa ako o ano pero tangina may stocks na ako ng smirnoff sa kwarto ko hahahahahaha.
2281 2018-12-08 12:42:00 Bullish on Cannabis stocks 
2282 2018-12-08 12:41:46 Yes, but look at the charts. The last few years these stocks carried the returns of the index. They were way to overbought as well as over owned. They were a top position in most mutual funds and ETFs. It couldn’t keep going without a correction. They are still great companies.
2283 2018-12-08 12:40:23 Why? Considering poor people are daily humiliated by poverty porn and the disdain of the govt? No hiding place. They're in the stocks. Being called 'rich' a problem? Only if you're a hypocrite.
2284 2018-12-08 12:38:57 It’s professional arrogance - they think they’re always right.  They aren’t - look at the past.  They should always be data dependent - look at the current housing market.  Stocks and yields yanked after Bullard said - maybe January lol - I think the message was ENOUGH !
2285 2018-12-08 12:36:58 What a predictable week in #stocks Given panic loves company, we may see some strong selling early in the week followed by support towards the end. Big money still sitting on sidelines.
2286 2018-12-08 12:36:05 Change the companies and keep buying stocks. You can't buy the whole world!
2287 2018-12-08 12:32:46 Yes. There is a lot of stress in the market now. Stocks catch the headlines, but it’s most likely in bonds the action (and perhaps greater risk) is.)
2288 2018-12-08 12:32:14 Vous avez d’autres insultes en stocks ? La vraie personnalité des macroniens se dévoilent en ces jours difficiles pour le pays.
2289 2018-12-08 12:31:50 A real conservative but truthful, fair and balanced news network is needed urgently. All the good crew from Fox and some from other networks and some unemployed can team up with their $ and expertise to make it happen. It will have a massive following and its stocks will rise

2292 2018-12-08 12:27:39 Sure. Advancing volume/declining volume. The volume of all stocks that were up on the day vs the volume of all stocks that were down on the day.
2293 2018-12-08 12:27:26 This fumbling fool has done nothing for the stocks but destroy it, we are heading for a recession and 2008 mortgage crisis  is going to look like a walk in the park!  We all need to put on our seatbelts as it is going to be a rough ride.
2294 2018-12-08 12:25:25 Stocks in tear gas might be holding the markets together.
2295 2018-12-08 12:25:19 I think this coupled with the debt, failing stocks, weakened economy, we might see an escalation in proceedings because it will now affect the GOP and wealthy donors. What do rich and powerful people do when the crap hits the fan?

2300 2018-12-08 12:10:47 Agree with you. More specifically
1. Non-crypto assets like stocks, bonds, currencies (more exchanges) and its derivatives get traded with BTC
2. Micropayment with Lightning (low fees)
3. More green bars to bring in a new set of believers as well as traders
2301 2018-12-08 12:10:32 Trump could be put into stocks and left out in the cold of winter or while in the stocks, he could be the target of thrown rotten tomatoes and such.

2303 2018-12-08 12:10:22 I heard the interview.  He thinks we have another 40% lower to go yet is 40% net long (if my memory serves).  I understand it’s a market of stocks but how could you be 40% net long if we’re going a lot lower.  Doesn’t make sense to me.
2304 2018-12-08 12:09:29 Good for him. That’s what I try to do, build long term cap gains. Dividends, mailbox money. What will be the long term stocks that march northward over the next 3 years. Do not give up on $FAANG. They still look good.

2306 2018-12-08 12:07:12 While @realDonaldTrump is most likely “Individual #1” & guilty of countless crimes, almost $1 trillion dollars has been wiped from the value of stocks in just 4 days of trading.
This has been one of the worst weeks for the Trump’s presidency since he stole the election in 2016!

2308 2018-12-08 12:01:45 The Ds also did not fully understand the impact of the financial strain on the Middle-Class. They did not recover from the 2008 meltdown. Businesses did, people wealthy enough to own stocks did, regular folks didn't. They were suffering. This fact was a major factor I think.
2309 2018-12-08 12:00:31 You must lack intelligence or live an elitist lifestyle. We know which side of the camp Ford comes from. At least Trudeau has intelligence to help us along. Ford will look like Trump on the world stage. Stocks will plummet & he will be richer for it.

Mogg + Johnson told us the NHS would be rich if we left. Johnson has since retracted. Mogg has since opened a hedge fund in Dublin to short UK stocks
2419 2018-12-08 09:31:54 Nifty next 50 pe is higher only due to these stocks. Very heavy on FMCG.

2421 2018-12-08 09:28:30 The best opportunities I think are companies that have a UK listing but no UK economic exposure & have sold off as capital has fled the UK market. A lot of small, cheap, FCF +ve resource stocks look interesting to me
2422 2018-12-08 09:28:30 I see a strong ISM and "kind of" safety trade in some US stocks and USD, however I fear all we might see is a bounce. Low crude will help lower inflation

2424 2018-12-08 09:26:26 So, you think it’s worth screwing our economy just because the EU is *trying* to manage fish stocks?
2425 2018-12-08 09:24:47 This is what it is happening with the stock market for at least 30 years thanks to the USD printing.
So, do you mean Bitcoin is acting like the stocks? Is this a test before the stock market crash?
2426 2018-12-08 09:23:34 And if exit polls turns out to be true then Tuesday again fall or recover?? What price action says??

2429 2018-12-08 09:21:56 No question is silly :) The NYSE Composite is a good index for checking the overall market performance as it includes all NYSE listed stocks. However, with such broadness, the reading could be a little distorted. In which case, the market-cap weighted S&P 500 index is better.

I went to the UPTC The Saem branch to check up on their stocks and the saleslady there was flamin mad. I went to her and asked her if coups and wonu will ever be restocked and she told me she isn't sure. I just said "oh okay" then looked
2472 2018-12-08 08:20:07 One moment, my example was purely about the 10th Am.
The 2nd Am. doesn't prohibit federal regulations of background checks, weapon types and numbers (e.g. no fully automatic machine guns), weapon accessories (magazines, bump stocks), gun storage (in safes), gun registration, etc.

2480 2018-12-08 08:04:42 Yeah it promised to limit the busts, so much for that, haha! Instead capitalists simply bought stocks at bottom dollar, taking a page from the book of Nathan Mayer Rothschild and his Waterloo trickery

Most of the HNI making mistakes when they opt LAS on higher value of stocks/ MF, Instead I believe, one should must opt LAS when market corrected significantly.

By this way, huge return can be possible.

Corker's four-a-day trade habit makes him a prolific day trader with a minor hobby serving as a US Senator.

2540 2018-12-08 06:39:07 Stocks are a bit overvalued historically, but I see it more as a reset than any big collapse.  This is not 2008.  The trigger could be anything but the real reason is the Fed.  Algos push everything too far but also create opportunity.  Control your risk.

2545 2018-12-08 06:34:29 It takes ages for food prices to increase. The stuff that increases quickly are fresh produce which isn’t that expensive so can go unnoticed. Manufactured foodstuffs have ingredient stocks so can take months to follow through to shelves.
2546 2018-12-08 06:33:22 Kabhi Kabhi toa lagta hei....
Yeh retailer ke hisab se toa 
Ketan parekh se leke RJ tak sub ke sub inke few lots trade ko trap krne bhete hei. Its funny .
Trust me we guys don't even stand in markets. Keep it simple n stay in realty. No one interested in ur trades. #stocks
2547 2018-12-08 06:33:10 Are Sheryl's and FB's CFO's investments the same?!Look into dumped Apple and Phone Company stocks and bought Microsoft and device makers.
2548 2018-12-08 06:30:56 Still comes back to, who can the public trust? These are the people we elected to do our business, handle our taxes, build and protect our province. A new model is required and I sincerely doubt that PR is the answer. Back to Guillotine & stocks?
2549 2018-12-08 06:30:31 I’m so sick of seeing losses to my IRA and stocks when Trump sends out one of his early morning toilet Tweets to send the market crashing. He may not care about a few thousand dollars here or there, but I certainly do! #WallStreet #Dow #WatchingMyStocksTank
2550 2018-12-08 06:25:38 Futures, Shorts/Longs, are for stocks commodities with large usages or proven business model with defined income stream. Name one start-up enterprise that faces these financial instruments, during validation! FB, Amazon, ... listed before dealing with these!!
So why does cryptos
2551 2018-12-08 06:24:57 Scott do u buy ETFs or stocks in your 401k
2552 2018-12-08 06:24:21 “Totally clears the President. Thank you!” You really are an idiot and a liar @realDonaldTrump BTW, how did your stocks do this week? Hope you took a bath like the everyone else. Stocks falling. Prison time coming. Happy Holidays, chump. #Resign
2553 2018-12-08 06:24:18 You can sell calls against your long ira. You cannot short. Lol. You can buy bear ETFs   If a stock is bad then you should short it. This isn’t 2008 dude. What examples do you have that short sellers are crushing good stocks?  You’re 10 years late on that complaint
2554 2018-12-08 06:21:39 I follow you because you are the best when it comes to updates and stocks. So reliable and helpful!! You’ve helped me get the cushions I’ve been wanting for a while  thank youuu
2555 2018-12-08 06:21:07 Vs and then just have one person kill themselves (lose stocks) then it should be a hidden character battle every time. Win and then close your game and open again. Rinse and repeat.
2556 2018-12-08 06:20:55 "No price too high" was the case of small & mid cap during 2017; was the case of few selected large cap (Private Banks, NBFC, Consumption stocks) during first half of 2018; was the case of Speciality Chemicals even today....these are the ultimate ingredient in a bubble.
2557 2018-12-08 06:20:29 You have to remember that financial media folks can’t own individual stocks (maybe except their own company) so they do have a financial interest in the market doing well.  Except for the few bond or cash only investors of which I’m sure is few
2558 2018-12-08 06:19:35 The market finds itself. No company ever went to zero that didn’t deserve to. You want to just have stocks go up but if i think the stock is terrible i should be able to bet the other way. It balances out the stock and prevents wild sell offs. Shorts keep the mkt balanced
2559 2018-12-08 06:19:12 Motley Fool has been promoting Canadian Bank stocks before the 10%+ fall this year saying they are so cheap, undervalued, oversold etc.. I suspect they have an automated daily process of sending bullish tone on TD RBC BNS shares lol.
2560 2018-12-08 06:18:36 I f-words accept htis   stocks ? :') 
2561 2018-12-08 06:18:08 This is another attempt to pass a bill to go after @POTUS. How transparent when everything he does will effect the stocks. @DonaldJTrumpJr
2562 2018-12-08 06:17:16 No. If ur shorting a “good company” eventually it will go to parity& the short sellers will get squeezed & lose a lot. You really don’t know much about the market.  We never short a good company. Most stocks have an uptick rule and a 10% rule that shuts the stock for 15 minutes
2563 2018-12-08 06:16:29 $PTX What I'd really like to know about  Stocktwits forum user Trubach or Guti (same person)  who trained this guy how to trade stocks? Even Timothy Sikes preaches cut your losses quickly!  I  shake my head in disbelief.
2564 2018-12-08 06:15:38 Whose stocks are falling exactly?
2565 2018-12-08 06:14:42 Well that’s no surprise considering that Trump has a lot of money in stocks. With the stock market plummeting he’s losing money and what’s more important to him than anything else is his money
2566 2018-12-08 06:14:34 okay bat ako nagreply sa kanila, natempt ako tuloy bumili ng shoes, not now! january para maluwag at ubos stocks na!
2567 2018-12-08 06:14:29 lmao if i had a dollar for each time we hugged, held hands, or clung to each other while in the pool last night, i’d be able to buy rbw + half of sm’s stocks. damn, i hope now that we won’t be seeing e/o everyday for the rest of the month, i can finally get over this silly crush
2568 2018-12-08 06:13:49 i already know it will be awesome
2569 2018-12-08 06:13:42 The actual fastest way to unlock is play classic and alternate btwn smash from like 1-3 stocks like five times. If you lose then just smash on a 3 stock smash battle or two and you’ll get the challenge option in the games and more menu
2570 2018-12-08 06:10:41 If I have $305k, i'd buy shares/stocks from Voopoo and be a partial owner of the company.. Then i'd fly to China once a month for site visits  @AngabeeDesignz @cosburndesigns @maria42901039
2571 2018-12-08 06:08:58 Can I just get a 1v1 game with three stocks and no items on a normal stage please? Like how is that not an option in this game???
2572 2018-12-08 06:06:53 @YoungDolph invest in stocks MJNA, EAPH, MCIG it might bring high tech leanand will make you a few more millions.
2573 2018-12-08 06:06:45 Secured stocks na ba? :/ i mean, nasa supplier mo na?
2574 2018-12-08 06:06:37 Yes we cover global stocks
2575 2018-12-08 06:05:28 Not so. I work helping people with their 401k/403b/etc plans. They’re virtually all in fund that invest in stocks and bonds. They’re both tanking.
2576 2018-12-08 06:03:30 Stocks dropped 3 days in a row. Doesn't seem like a up & down daily basis.
2577 2018-12-08 06:02:24 Things that work in investing: Value and momentum. I trend follow breakouts of value stocks. Simple.
2578 2018-12-08 06:01:53 Really? I don’t know if you need that much time for 3 stocks though.
2579 2018-12-08 06:00:27 Interesting point in Wealth report by Motilal Oswal on return on equity on balance sheet vs roe of business and why pe is deceptive- buying low PE stocks is barely right just as buying v high pe stocks doesn't work.
2580 2018-12-08 06:00:22 Totally understand...  tanking stocks is like World Cup Football.   Simply a must watch.
2581 2018-12-08 06:00:15 Seems like it's getting to a good time to buy good stocks. Apple, Amazon etc.
2582 2018-12-08 05:59:54 how do i invest in meth stocks
2583 2018-12-08 05:59:35 I never hesitate to tell a man that I am bullish or bearish. But I do not tell people to buy or sell any particular stock. In a bear market all stocks go down and in a bull market they go up. 
~ Jesse Livermore
2584 2018-12-08 05:58:39 So I’m guessing pilloried in the public square is a non-starter, which is most unfortunate. Settle for “egged in stocks.”
2585 2018-12-08 05:58:14 CDs are the only thing going up these days. Both bonds and stocks are crashing. They (@Marketplace) says this is very unusual.
2586 2018-12-08 05:56:59 New strategies selling most of my stocks and holding all monthly Dividend paying stocks. Most of Trump's misdeeds are coming to light and effecting the market in a very negative way. Going to mostly cash and when opportunities arise, I will treat the market like a shower. In &out
2587 2018-12-08 05:56:58 Also, check to see when your stocks or funds pay dividends. I checked and mine pay out on Dec. 22nd. You could be missing out on thousands in dividends because you didn't wait two weeks.
2588 2018-12-08 05:54:50 UPL
2589 2018-12-08 05:54:48 You dare to sell stocks at 10% loss (40% loss has more nerves) or better and buy a coin that has dropped 80%? ...  Dig deep to core .. if you have it ... you are a demon ... better enjoy it .... Best Wishes...

2598 2018-12-08 05:44:13 Nahhhh. Gold, silver, uranium and crypto look like a nice buy for mid to long term. Take profits and sell the majority of stocks though. Longest stock bulmarket ever is ending.
2599 2018-12-08 05:43:34 apple stocks rise by 10%.
2600 2018-12-08 05:42:15 Can't mention stocks on this platform, however there are some in chemicals space, FIBC space and there are some in pharma and building products which will be completing expansion in next 2-3 quarters
2601 2018-12-08 05:41:56 Enron is a great analogy for Trump. Banckruptcy, indicted, some execs in prison. Billions $ lost by shareholders & of course employees lost pensions. I remember seeing  an interview w/ a just retired man, gave 30 years to Enron & even bought stocks. Great way to run a country
2602 2018-12-08 05:40:32 Gold stocks, do it now.

2605 2018-12-08 05:38:13 You cut off the lower bulb bend the stalks several times to release flavor. Add to soups and stocks but remove before serving. You can slice it very thin to eat but be aware it is fibrous so it needs to be cooked well
2606 2018-12-08 05:34:48 Yeah price action is the best way to trade.... It's more effective if we have selected stocks in our watchlist

2617 2018-12-08 05:24:53 ”Good stocks, cheap!”
2618 2018-12-08 05:24:44 Its that time of year. Come and order your Xmas beer at Nutbrook Brewery to make sure you get what you want. Stocks are moving fast. See the farms new butchery and farmshop together with the coffe shop which is just about ready for business
2619 2018-12-08 05:23:42 I bowling Ball'd Walrus's Inkling on warioware and he died at sub 30% 2 stocks in a row. I was at 0% lol
2620 2018-12-08 05:19:16 Many Stocks in pharma are good as well .. m not bearish on as a whole ... Many Stocks look great .. as well ... #SecretList 
2621 2018-12-08 05:19:14 Either would be a challenge.  Since Toyota moved in, and the explosion of growth, Plano housing stocks are a challenge and a premium.  
San Antonio, on the same note, is growing exponentially, as well.  Same challenges, though housing stocks may have more options.
2622 2018-12-08 05:18:25 Not going to indulge us on the stocks you're looking at? 
2623 2018-12-08 05:17:53 Time to buy more stocks in these companies.

Stocks are up where? Certainly not in America. They are way down.
You have a job? Good for you. I haven't been out of work 25yrs now.
Your "president" is a habitual liar who is not going to last a full term.
He conspired with Russia to steal  the election

2642 2018-12-08 05:00:50 He is a total pig. The stocks are going down not up. He talks about grabbing women by the pussys.  Talks trash about other races and handicapped people. He has not one shred of human decency.  He will never admit fault in any of his wrong doings.  Narcissism at a high arc.
2643 2018-12-08 04:57:13 Maybe the brand has something to do with it? Maybe their marketing is so effective that even the garage speaks about them and stocks their gear in prominent view?

Could you suggest any short term - small cap stocks to Hold.
2651 2018-12-08 04:50:57 Lol at Lyft, Slack, and Uber IPOing now. More proof QE was bad for the supply of stocks?

2653 2018-12-08 04:48:41 You don't make money when you buy stocks. And you don't make money when you sell stocks. You make money by waiting." - @MohnishPabrai
2654 2018-12-08 04:48:04 My guess, which is all it is, the tax scams brought money to the 1% that it doesn't know what to do with, so they bought stocks and bubbled the market, and this was just a violent adjustment because stocks were so over valued.  When, not if, the recession comes, NO BAILOUT!
2655 2018-12-08 04:46:18 Can you change how many stocks there are in Squad Strike?

2658 2018-12-08 04:41:19 So true...lol..I say this because I wanted to gauge the inherent bias of owning the stocks.  ATM Cronos and Canopy have to have the edge simply because they are in bed with MAJOR US MULTINATIONALS.
2659 2018-12-08 04:40:37 To me there is no wrong hill to die on when it comes to the 2nd amendment. Stop conflating bump stocks with full auto. They aren't the same thing at all.

2665 2018-12-08 04:35:52 The way I open, close and manage my Forex Trades via futures is an area I need to work and improve on.
As with stocks money management is so important, need to do more work on when to open a position and when to close.
At this stage will only trade AUD/USD both ways
2666 2018-12-08 04:34:51 No wonder stocks fell today
2667 2018-12-08 04:33:52 broooooo…I've noticed you are sucker for stocks that move on air with very little volume. high volatility and low volume is a recipe for serious bag holding. good call though. please completely disregard this random observation of mine about your picks if need be. all jmo

2674 2018-12-08 04:29:59 "While prohibiting bump stocks is a common-sense step to keeping Americans safe, this alone isn’t enough — now we must focus on what comes next. "

It will never be enough, will it? Be honest and admit it - you don't want us common folk to have firearms.

2683 2018-12-08 04:24:04 I think you're right to be concerned. I took all my money out of stocks and mutual funds a year ago. I don't make much on it but also won't lose it all.
2684 2018-12-08 04:23:48 tbh his passive aggressive statements at vamp make me think Cog got under his skin so bad he went out and got all the stocks of @mortonsalt

2689 2018-12-08 04:20:12 You right if waters becomes chair of the finance committee! Maybe that’s why stocks took a big shot preparing for the worst!

2696 2018-12-08 04:10:46 @ChrisDunnTV Hey man love your content and definitely share the same mindset and approach as you when it comes to investing. You are great at understanding the herd mentality so here's a question for you... Thoughts on marijuana/hemp/cbd oil stocks and that market.
2697 2018-12-08 04:10:42 Nakakaloka. Kahapon ang dami pang stocks ng planner, ngayon nag-iisa nalang! Buti may naabutan pa ko. 
2698 2018-12-08 04:09:07 oo nga eh omg :(( pumunta lang ako ngayon tapos sabi nila 25 lang yung stocks kahapon! Hays dapat mga 500+ KSHJHDSJ
2699 2018-12-08 04:07:20 Oh gawd!  Who wants to see that?!?!?!?!  I'd rather they bring back the stocks.
2700 2018-12-08 04:06:55 Right?! I honestly am so over it and they don’t deserve my page anymore. Taking myself down is just easier so I can move on and past this dilemma, plus they lose stocks the less profiles they have.
2701 2018-12-08 04:06:50 I am surprised that SEC can't inspect accounts of Chinese cos listed in US at the moment.  Many non US co ADRs were subject to this for decades.  SEC demand is genuine with stocks like $BABA trading at lofty valns, knowing accounts is necessary to avoid big risks for investors.
2702 2018-12-08 04:06:23 I need to start investing in these brands stocks, since I’m always giving them my money
2703 2018-12-08 04:04:58 But then there's something where the rules change even thought you rematch the same player. I was sooo confused as to why this keeps happening. Like the match went from 3 stocks->2 stocks and 7min-> 5min from the same person I was just playing!!
2704 2018-12-08 04:02:45 Invest in people. Not stocks cause when the money is gone who will be there when you need to talk.
2705 2018-12-08 04:01:41 @AllyInvest MJNA,EAPH,MCIG invest stocks about to go up.

2712 2018-12-08 03:56:28 Mason Fine got looked over for this one. Better stats than Stocks. However, I have to say - if you watched this Conf Championship game, this kid runs a very VERY creative offense - I say that as a UNT Alumni. He was FUN to watch. More than Mason? No. But I’m biased. 
2713 2018-12-08 03:55:57 Anything to tank Trump. Stocks will go back up....
2714 2018-12-08 03:55:49 That will be a real financial eye opener when that comes out! Another popcorn moment. I'd say buy Orville Redenbacher stocks, but...
2715 2018-12-08 03:55:19 I have mortgaged all my stocks with a bank in order to lock them for 20-30 years. Hence, I can't sell them in any circumstance
2716 2018-12-08 03:54:23 I'd like to go to 4110 Calle Isabella San Clemente CA 92672 with keys from the Gates to all doors and be working on projects with stocks bonds and portfolio s in my hand not attached to some shape shifter van! I need a pitcher not a belly pitcher and Christmas is approaching fast
2717 2018-12-08 03:53:38 I have no investment in stocks but last time the markets tanked, so did banks, jobs all went away across all different fields, and everyone except the 1% suffered
2718 2018-12-08 03:52:45 Some people shouldn’t own stocks, ever
2719 2018-12-08 03:52:44 Robert, how much did you have to risk to achieve that return?  I never trade options, just stocks.  $20,000 is one helluva day...great work.
2720 2018-12-08 03:49:55 Most old people have a managed IRA also. One where they didn't pick which stocks to hold. This is an angle we may see if ETF gets approved... They will hold BTC without having to use it/store it.
2721 2018-12-08 03:48:32 Luckily he got to divest a lot of his stocks without having to pay taxes.
2722 2018-12-08 03:45:08 Apple Facebook Netflix Amazon all down 20-50%..these were stocks that were leaders in last bullmarket and are now sell on rallies...there is a bug shift in market dynamics if you look under the covers
2723 2018-12-08 03:45:03 Facts i been on @Stash grabbing mad cannabis stocks
2724 2018-12-08 03:44:44 Really shocked by the fact this isn’t covered by CCTV, a hideous thing to happen. Hope culprit is caught and put in the stocks so we can all throw rotten fruit at them. Shame on you @Morrisons
2725 2018-12-08 03:43:48 The main thing here is market is forward looking and always work in discounting mechanism. Right now market is discounting US growth/earnings have peaked and that is biggest pricing element for stocks...
2726 2018-12-08 03:43:42 No.  The volatility of the stock market is due to that stupid Muppet who can't make up his mind about whether he's going to sabotage the US economy with interest rate hikes or not!

Good God!  When he says he's going to raise rates, stocks drop. When he says he won't, they go up.
2727 2018-12-08 03:42:24 100% true fact: Fintwit is always best after a horrible week in stocks.

2729 2018-12-08 03:41:23 Kudos to @elonmusk and the entire $tsla team for defying the odds. Stock haters have turned romantic making it to be one of the best accumulated #investing stocks in this dampened, gloomy #WallSt. When would @GM and @Ford shift into innovation gears?
2730 2018-12-08 03:40:57 Market cap weights favour momentum. Rising stocks gain weight. Would prefer that smart beta indices scan top 250 stocks on fundamental metrics instead of just Nifty basket. Can be equal wt.

2735 2018-12-08 03:36:47 Is throwing money into stocks not the same thing as sports gambling?
2736 2018-12-08 03:35:38 when i was working at the bank i met the sweetest old guy who schooled me about stocks and accumulating wealth. he harassed me everyday with articles and research until i agreed to sit down with him for breakfast
2737 2018-12-08 03:34:37 So since The "President" declares credit for such a strong stock market, shouldn't he likewise take credit for the astounding fallout in stocks the last two plus weeks?   Credit where credit is due Trump.  I hear silence.

2739 2018-12-08 03:34:02 Following Wednesday’s news of the arrest of #Huawei Technologies CFO Meng Wanzhou, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index plunged nearly 2.5%, with tech stocks taking the brunt of the selling frenzy. Canadian authorities arrested Meng on Saturday for allegedly violating US trade controls.
2740 2018-12-08 03:33:38 The country’sbest interests are not being served. Top1% owns 38% stocks, the huge tax giveaway to the very rich, the plundering of federal land, the deregulation of protections for air, water and earth do not best serve Americans.Trump getting even richer does not serve USA.
2741 2018-12-08 03:32:40 And you then can find?  Why are all trumper's illiterate? Thank you for making the stereotype a reality.   Let me guess, you and your 70 followers don't have any stocks because McDonald's doesn't offer stock options.

Who the fuck is going to invest in Slack IPO, where’s it generating revenue/profit? Who’s going to buy Uber at $100 bln valuation? No one is. Fear is setting in. FAANG stocks are dead.

2759 2018-12-08 03:21:01 "NOW with added BLUE Passports!" Hurry! While stocks last!

Or before we get rumbled"

Tory  Ministerial Services. "Why pay less?" 

Persuading Britain to vote itself poorer since 2010.

(Just as long as we can still sell the NHS to America we Tories will be all right, Jack.)
2760 2018-12-08 03:20:57 I’m a lifelong firearm enthusiast, movement conservative and dedicated 2nd Am. supporter.   I do support this move.  The way I see it, bump stocks, cranks, etc. are loopholes around the longstanding full auto ban, which NRA has supported and we have all lived with just fine.

2781 2018-12-08 03:05:23 A year ago.....Barron’s strategist forecasts for 2018:

Why to trust jokers ??
2782 2018-12-08 03:04:34 We have opposite problems. I stock nothing that I really love eating, because I have zero willpower and it will all be gone in one day--but every time I visit, my mom stocks all my trigger foods because she equates food with love, and knows I enjoy them.
2783 2018-12-08 03:04:27 What do you think of those low volatility stock ETF's? @egfalken says they have out performed other stocks over long periods.
2784 2018-12-08 03:03:50 Congratulations on your fucking up the government.
How bad has the start to December been for U.S. stock investors? Almost $1 trillion has been wiped from the value of stocks in just four days of trading
2785 2018-12-08 03:03:23 Really insightful article! Let's keep our emotions in check while trading stocks and speculating.

2787 2018-12-08 03:02:57 FWIW, I have a value tilt in my tax-advantaged accounts and dividend payers are more likely to be value than growth stocks. We may have found a patch of common ground there.

Of course, past performance does not predict future results, etc...
2788 2018-12-08 03:01:09 What is fake? My stocks are down, I am unemployed, all the good people you hire leave you, and your products are made in China!

2793 2018-12-08 02:57:14 Not just volatile,  but negative . DJT, thanks for the bear market in most stocks , the slowing economy, the stagnant wage growth, the decline in capex and exports ,  falling housing, ag and energy prices that threaten small businessses, rising medical costs and interest rates
2794 2018-12-08 02:55:30 I finally invest money into weed stocks! Watch my shit blow up in couple years
2795 2018-12-08 02:55:11 But you’re fine with people with diabetes worrying, right? Cause you profited and likely will in the future when you’re done with govt and go back to pharma or cash in your Lilly stocks. You’re such a humanitarian.
2796 2018-12-08 02:53:55 may stocks pa ba sa trinoma or masasayang lang punta ko? :(
2797 2018-12-08 02:53:54 May you live in interesting times... That certainly will be the case as extreme volatility will arrive (more than usual). Before we can think about any sustainable rally, have to get sector stocks above the 200-Day MA. Long way to go still. Buy extreme dips with a long term view.
2798 2018-12-08 02:52:06 @OpTic_BigTymeR I wanted to ask you a quick question about your upcoming website. Is it intended for people of all kinds of experience? Or more for those with some knowledge? Im interested in learning but I know absolutely nothing about stocks.
2799 2018-12-08 02:51:41 Another REASON TO IMPEACH TRUMP... unless trump goes, stocks will continue declining.  Trump & his colleagues (1)disrupted international trade (2 )caused Massive Deficits (3 alienated ALL our trading partners...business and billionaires will turn on him @GOP @SenateGOP @HouseGOP
2800 2018-12-08 02:51:31 Prof Stiller I am a student of your Econ online course.

2803 2018-12-08 02:49:09 To quote our fine President*: WRONG!  Stocks are down because of Trump’s tariffs, chaos, and faulty economic policies.  The market does not like uncertainty, and uncertainty is just what Mr. Trump projects!
2804 2018-12-08 02:49:07 Our country is going to going to hell. Stocks are losing money and our senate and congress can’t come together to work on the issues that need to be addressed.

2807 2018-12-08 02:48:16 If uber and lyft are filing IPO. The feds better raise rates next month.... definitely should not be a one and done. Watch them pump those stocks up and dump for a quick buck.
2808 2018-12-08 02:48:03 U.S. stocks closes far lower Friday 12/07/18 $DJIA -2.24% at 24,388.95, $SPX -2.33% at 2,633.08, $COMPQ -3.05% at 6,969.25, $RUT -1.98% at $1448.09.
2809 2018-12-08 02:46:44 While I loved the potential income the stocks offered, there was never a concrete value attached to them.  Lump sum cash awards have replaced the RSUs for milestone anniversaries.  I think most people prefer cash...and it doesn't depreciate in value...
2810 2018-12-08 02:46:25 Cyah respect any woman that fck for what she have. And I doe mean a man you fckin organize you with something cuz he love/cherish/appreciate you. I mean straight up sexual transaction. You pass the pussy, he pass the stocks/funds. No respect #SorryNotSorry
2811 2018-12-08 02:45:28 Nice story @kayezad My problem with smart beta in India is that the stocks in NV20, Quality30 etc are still drawn from the market cap weighted indices.
2812 2018-12-08 02:45:18 The latest incident should raise additional questions as to the role of #HongKing as #CCP front for the purpose of circumventing American laws while maintaining as the #gateway for American portfolio investments in #Chinese stocks. Then again, it should have been raised in 1997!
2813 2018-12-08 02:43:56 when the mischievous egoistic non odia @Naveen_Odisha dropped the charged on @Iyervval  ,that shows what a tight slap that was on own face and on the overactive courts. and how laughable are the laughing stocks. btw 1rupee voters can hardly realise.
2814 2018-12-08 02:43:47 Pot stocks = 
2815 2018-12-08 02:43:29 Hmm these stages are gorgeous. But... Im having a hard time focusing on the battles right now because of the very detailed stuff! Is this how playing on modded stages feel like? Im sorry for making people loose stocks then!
2816 2018-12-08 02:43:00 Well, history shows that dividend paying stocks win out on total return.  Dividends are always a free lunch. I trust a management team that’s willing to reward shareholders rather than pay lucrative bonuses or acquire companies at non-accretive valuations.  (cc: $CRM, $NFLX)
2817 2018-12-08 02:40:11 There is much more to it. It’s the attitude towards Eire, the same oppressive plantation attitude that stripped Ireland of its food stocks whilst the potato crop failed. Cromwell and Trevelyan - its genesis was in the 17th century. The same under Churchill in Benghal - 4m dead.
2818 2018-12-08 02:39:52 Q is a fraud. Nothing the fed has done has influenced the downward spiral of the market. 1)housing downturn
2) oppressive tariffs
3)over valued stocks 
4)uncertain, irrational policies by THIS POTUS.
Again.
Q is a fraud.
2819 2018-12-08 02:38:46 Stocks crashing, Congress flipping, Mueller Indicting, Trade War Failing......bet Trump doesn’t sleep much tonight!
2820 2018-12-08 02:38:06 IF you were advising your buddy GUy on two Cannabis Stocks he must own forever, what would you tell @guyAdami ?? #DontBeaCramer
2821 2018-12-08 02:37:36 So far the Smash Bros Online is alright? No communication errors, and plenty of smooth 1 on 1 matches. 4 player matches are a lottery on if they'll go well. Granted when the player with the worst connection runs out of stocks, the match suddenly goes smooth
2822 2018-12-08 02:37:20 Also the damage is already being done, tech stocks crashed, companies are making decisions as they approach Christmas, goodbye Christmas bonus, goodbye planning for next year.
2823 2018-12-08 02:36:41 Dudeee what the hell are these shite matchmaking rules on Smash Ult? Lol I chose 1v1, 3 stocks, 7mins and it puts me in a team battle, 3mins instead???? Ya fockin wot m8
2824 2018-12-08 02:36:21 Why didn't @realDonaldTrump say anything when stocks go down?
2825 2018-12-08 02:35:53 Hello @PUMAPH_official, do you still have stocks of the BTS Patent Basket in Trinoma?

2832 2018-12-08 02:26:06 1. Will you or will you not admit that for whatever points this article makes, it says **nothing** about my point about Trump’s tax cuts being used to buy back stocks rather than create new work or pay existing workers more?
2833 2018-12-08 02:25:49 Elections, crude price, tariff war, Brexit - there is always something to worry about. If we're unable to ignore worries, better not to be in stocks. It's not worth trading peace of mind for wealth.
2834 2018-12-08 02:25:07 Mali nga yung basehan ng kaso, hindi naman napatunayan na dealer of stocks ang Rappler. Basahin nyo muna yung decision ng CA
2835 2018-12-08 02:23:20 That's exactly what they ask other citizens to do when asking for help. And also any other stocks and bonds. The oil company already got 12 billion dollars for doing nothing. How much do they need.
2836 2018-12-08 02:21:03 The stock market falls 10%, on average, every 11 months. Every 4 years, on average, it falls 20%. Now, it is down 10.4%.
Throughout history, these have been among the best times to buy the stocks of great companies.

This is the truth gerber.
2837 2018-12-08 02:20:44 It’s likely a rig; even though the Dow has dropped, try to scoop how many shares are sold and then bought on the cheap, and who is buying, and what stocks they are buying; then scoop who are investing direct funds and/or lobbying to expand the profits of those same companies
2838 2018-12-08 02:19:52 hey there Usual dummy. The big $ guys just sucker play the low intel guys like you with a booming high priced stocks out look, the simply sell &sell & sell..which means they are "taking profits". Yeah they do that. I know I was once of the $ losers too. Owe it hurts. Me = dummy.
2839 2018-12-08 02:19:21 Stocks plunge again.  Lost a bunch of money this week.  

I’m so tired of winning.  

However, when you think about it, losing money is worth it helps get rid of this cancerous pustule in the WH.
2840 2018-12-08 02:19:02 2 stocks just can't
2841 2018-12-08 02:18:33 Any election outcome is one day phenomenon for stock market whether its state or parliamentary elections.

Whoever wins doesn't matter for stocks like
UJAAS ENERGY

These are junks during Modi government and remain junk in any government .
2842 2018-12-08 02:17:38 @DavidGFool @TMFJMo @MArgersinger @TMFChrisHill @David_Kretzmann show idea: what stocks have y’all bought in the last month and why?
2843 2018-12-08 02:17:16 Those who would give up essential Canvas, to purchase a little temporary Track, deserve neither Breast nor Stocks.
2844 2018-12-08 02:14:41 Doesn’t sound bad at all I’m looking into real estate more and stocks as well.
2845 2018-12-08 02:12:29 It is from the net-net screener, which extends to stocks 100-300% of NNWC. The article has been updated to reflect this. Thank you.
2846 2018-12-08 02:11:59 Wow lol if you gsp is too high and you enter a casual setting, you only get one stock lmao. Fell off the map during a change and "Player 1 defeated" while everyone else had two stocks.
2847 2018-12-08 02:09:18 Evidently, you didn't get the memo...or forgot to read it.  Trade negotiations with China are on-going and the stocks are doing great!  
2848 2018-12-08 02:07:53 U.S. stocks plunged, capping the worst week for the S&P 500 Index since March, as the U.S. pressed its trade war on China, tensions rose over the arrest of Huawei's CFO, jobs data disappointed, and oil prices rose after OPEC agreed to cut output. (Bloomberg)
2849 2018-12-08 02:07:37 Trade war protagonists: SPX is down 1.5% ytd.  Shanghai Composite is down 21.2% ytd. I'm willing to predict that before 2018 is out, US stocks will have dropped by a lot more and closed a chunk of that 20% gap.
2850 2018-12-08 02:06:03 And buy stocks 75% cheaper with half the price 
2851 2018-12-08 02:05:06 The stock market falls 10%, on average, every 11 months. Every 4 years, on average, it falls 20%. Now, it is down 10.4%.

Throughout history, these have been among the best times to buy the stocks of great companies -- if you're willing to hold on for 5-10+ years.
2852 2018-12-08 02:05:03 A ban on bump stocks, improved background checks, safe storage laws, red flag laws, and possible assault weapons ban, you know the things people actually want, is common sense gun control.
2853 2018-12-08 02:02:58 An over educated financially illiterate British political scientist. Stocks don’t split? Comparing the Dow over a large span of time is no reflection of poor economic performance. Wow. Maybe you should head back to school...
2854 2018-12-08 02:02:09 .
Now THERE is someone who has found Jesus... and a growing fondness of 2nd amendment.

He might want bump stocks and extended magazines... and never enter his car again!
2855 2018-12-08 02:01:24 Charts held up at very end of the day Barely but good enough $IWM was ugly but I believe just an anomaly  I can also argue Feb low support  i had to buy $SPX & $QQQ big, not indiv stocks w little time
2856 2018-12-08 02:00:56 I am mega bullish on crypto and mega bearish on stocks. If you feel the opposite, I feel truly sorry for you. You will not change my mind, I will change yours.
2857 2018-12-08 02:00:32 I used to be a 401k analyst but haven't been for many, many years so don't take this as gospel (things may have changed) but you have options of what your money will be invested in so you can move to stable value funds & switch back to stocks in the future.
2858 2018-12-08 01:59:55 What about pot stocks?
2859 2018-12-08 01:59:44 @FoxBusiness Please explain how people make money when they sell stocks that are dropping (short sale).  How well are 401K accounts doing when the market moves ? When the markets move rapidly don' t the Brokers make money ?
2860 2018-12-08 01:59:02 Too poor to own stocks.
2861 2018-12-08 01:57:45 @GOP @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @SenMajLdr @SpeakerRyan

1TRILLION was WIPED out in U.S. STOCKS thanks to MR. Tariff MAN aka: Individual 1!
2862 2018-12-08 01:57:38 Okay, so, now we have Air BnB looking into building their own homes, Lyft and Uber looking to drop IPOs, how does that affect the hotel and taxi business? Time to buy some stocks, I guess?
2863 2018-12-08 01:56:43 @realDonaldTrump is geographically separating technology companies. Either you’re with #USA and it’s allies or you’re not. Technology companies will be required to choose. They’re fighting it right now and losing. Tech stocks are suffering and dirt is being dug up on them.
2864 2018-12-08 01:56:05 As always we all will have to wait for 11th Dec to know the final results and the mkt will will always go up and down with reason or without reason because market is always right and supreme

2866 2018-12-08 01:55:17 Nice job on the podcast Arun. Listening to it as I update one of your favorite areas of the market...pot stocks lol.
2867 2018-12-08 01:55:09 Ok now Sir Ed, tell me this as I’m confused. Cash flow out of stocks but where is it going? Stocks, bonds, gold, oil, emerging markets, euro are all no! Where’s the cash parked and going into next?
2868 2018-12-08 01:55:01 Pot stocks were marching to the beat of their own drum circle today.
2869 2018-12-08 01:54:48 How all things go if for current legal issues that president will not serve full term. That’s going be bigger political risks to stocks & business - double down on current risks. I hope someone will get regulation over Algos trading which makes investing fast & furious gambling
2870 2018-12-08 01:49:59 @realDonaldTrump

2872 2018-12-08 01:46:02 How to Make Money in Stocks
2873 2018-12-08 01:45:36 If these new leagues were stocks, I would short them
2874 2018-12-08 01:45:26 Need to invest into stocks next year
2875 2018-12-08 01:45:05 The correlation between stocks and bonds in the U.S. has started to trend upward. This means that using long-duration bonds as a shock absorber or hedge in a portfolio may become more difficult. Investors may need to look elsewhere for defensive positioning against equity risk.
2876 2018-12-08 01:44:07 Perfect.  Should be home by then.  Great day trading stocks so treating myself to a McDonald's 2am uk time lol.
2877 2018-12-08 01:43:25 @FcBlackHat 3 million shares at one time.. I’ve got to many other stocks that are about to pop to 3$ and they at .50 ... I’ll check back
2878 2018-12-08 01:42:34 I would rather short the dollar than stocks...Too many tricks will get stocks back to all time highs...the wave won't last...
2879 2018-12-08 01:40:30 This is the worst start to a December since 2008 for all three major U.S. indexes, which had another wreck of a day. The Nasdaq Composite, laden with tech stocks, bore the brunt of the selloff. The S&P 500 is now back to where it started at the end of October.

2883 2018-12-08 01:36:01 “Individual-1” isn’t Top Trend over Delly and #SeduceMeIn4Words ?



1. Mixing trends function is busted: ie “#MuellerFriday #CohenSentencingMemo 

2. Twitter Stocks need Trump Tweets

3. Twitter’s real owner and Putin’s muppet, Yuri Milner, will not allow it

4. Delly Rules!
2884 2018-12-08 01:35:37 Wife is over here giving me shit for not “taking a break” from stocks. I’m sorry that I prefer to look at stocks as opposed to watch Elf for the 20th time in the last two weeks.
2885 2018-12-08 01:32:25 Today wasn’t a fun day to have a portfolio full of high beta stocks but this tweet made me laugh very hard.  Next level sarcasm!  Much appreciated!
2886 2018-12-08 01:32:07 $SPY To be clear, I'm not bullish in the sense of calling for a new ATH on the market. Simply trading stocks long for a short period of time
2887 2018-12-08 01:31:31 Wtf just got put in a 3 stock free for all starting with 2 stocks is this a glitch or is it because of my gsp. Also plz stop putting me in free for alls
2888 2018-12-08 01:31:03 More articles about stocks; less articles of right wing / libertarian propaganda
2889 2018-12-08 01:30:19 Meron na ba sainyo? Wala pang stocks dito eh, ubos na pera ko
2890 2018-12-08 01:29:57 Very possible. Even as a bear I was suprised by the immediate give back of the entire rally from 263. There are still many individual stocks at very expensive valuations, and those are dragging everything else down
2891 2018-12-08 01:29:17 @DAWGS4LIFE @microm you don’t buy great stocks on charts unless you are short term trader !!
2892 2018-12-08 01:29:04 $SPY IMO, pessimism is overdone here. Today I loaded up long positions on relatively strong stocks for swing up. We shall see.
2893 2018-12-08 01:28:45 But what if total return for dividend stocks is better than non dividend stocks?

2898 2018-12-08 01:24:22 $5 is the price at which stocks are marginable. That may be what you are thinking of...
2899 2018-12-08 01:24:08 I'm pretty happy to see tech stocks crashing.

2904 2018-12-08 01:20:52 Looking at our records performance for swing trades past two months is atrocious. At least 30% losses on these biotech stocks:
$ALRN $TTPH $MLNT $LXRX 

To adapt and survive is we do daily options calls & puts. I think it’s very important to add options skills to your arsenal.
2905 2018-12-08 01:19:20 Time for everyone to sell all stocks and go to cash
2906 2018-12-08 01:19:13 If you're selling when stocks are down how are you not losing money??
2907 2018-12-08 01:17:49 My stocks are flying through the God damn roof, son.
2908 2018-12-08 01:17:20 Cannabis stocks are up!
2909 2018-12-08 01:16:28 Almost exactly half (748) of the stocks in the broad S&P 1500 are at least 20% below their 52-week high
2910 2018-12-08 01:16:27 @MariaBartiromo And it will, Comey will laugh as he skates free and clear. McCarthy will lead the Rinos to the coatroom for the next 2 yrs. What a disgrace last sellout over at K street selling Dope stocks Ryan heading there! This party has no decent leaders, Bush eulogy did what
2911 2018-12-08 01:16:08 i have 2 stocks... but its sisters want one?
2912 2018-12-08 01:15:46 If you trade stocks, once the bell rings on Friday that’s it, you’re done. With FX it takes an hour or two for the broker to close, and anyho the volume is so low there’s no point in trading.

This is is forced leave from stress until Australia opens.
2913 2018-12-08 01:15:31 I think that corporations spent all their tax cut cash on stock buy backs--something that was supposed to make their stocks go up in price.
It's weirdly nice to think that in just this one week, corps lost 5% of their value just because "tariff man" is threatening world markets.
2914 2018-12-08 01:15:20 Except CBD stocks have yet to have any kind of run up like the weeds had into legalization.
2915 2018-12-08 01:14:15 GUO YIN UNITY stocks climb despite troubling geopolitical headlines
2916 2018-12-08 01:14:04 This isn't the economy, it's the stock market. Stocks were oversold when Obama came in, so it stands to reason they would have a significantly higher % increase as they recovered. This chart is %, not mcap.
2917 2018-12-08 01:13:38 apple stocks rise by 69%.
2918 2018-12-08 01:12:18 Why should a retiree be guaranteed 80-100% of their working income in perpetuity?

You dont have to invest in stocks in your 401k. One can invest in a variety of asset classes. Even crypto now!

I expect to see USD 1850 - 1900 gold by early 2021 latest . We take it as it comes. I am basically a mining stocks investor.
2920 2018-12-08 01:10:26 Problem is that Trumptrash’s core base has no investment in stocks, no pension plans, very many unemployed or in black economy, and,above all too thick to have facts like those even register with them.
2921 2018-12-08 01:10:09 Yeah fuck US stocks smashing me for 4% today. Didn’t need that money anyway ya dick’ed 
2922 2018-12-08 01:10:08 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
2923 2018-12-08 01:08:52 The DJIA dropped 2.2% today, ahead of the S&P 500's 2.3% loss. The  Nasdaq fell 3.1%. In the end, the week turned into a mirror copy of last week. So basically we are exactly where we were 2 weeks ago. #investors #stocks #trade
2924 2018-12-08 01:06:05 My high risk stocks saved me today 
2925 2018-12-08 01:05:56 China talks going well. All stocks have lost in historical amounts since your great negotiations. Are you freaking blind and dumb?RESIGN,  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.
2926 2018-12-08 01:05:51 OTC stocks that closed green today. Which is the best buy at the opening bell next week? 

$KATX .0007 to .0011
Volume 201 million 

$RSHN .0013 to .0018

2930 2018-12-08 01:04:25 Stocks? I always assumed you had Bowie Bonds.
2931 2018-12-08 01:04:21 Well of course they are all about profits! Ever heard of capitalism? They have a board of directors and shareholders to answer to. Don't you own any stocks? Are you asking them too reduce profits?
2932 2018-12-08 01:04:03 Waited 9 months to trade again. Bought some at 4k for the bounce that didn't happened! :D If it goes lower with high volume maybe i will buy a little bit more. I am not a day trader. I am searching for lithium, asteroid mining and cannabis stocks.
2933 2018-12-08 01:03:24 Fun Facts: In #Byways Bk9, Brielle stocks up on paint. "Dartmouth Daisy" is a soft yellow. "Floating Island" is a pale blue. #NH #50States

2936 2018-12-08 01:00:35 interaction b/t Fed & markets not a one-way street as you imply. can be mutually reinforcing: stocks could just as easily get crushed on their own thereby causing Fed to turn dovish
2937 2018-12-08 01:00:12 You know the scary part is you all think #IndividualOne will be arrested tonight or over the weekend. He won't be. Not how this works and there is still a lot of bad shit a man with his power can do. Nukes, martial law, stocks, and just about anything else. #resisters

2939 2018-12-08 00:59:45 I'm having a real hard time on em'.
It's hard securing stocks without Side B confirms and getting caught without a jump or getting your side B countered SUCKS.
2940 2018-12-08 00:59:12 Nick, what are you and yours up to? Did she make a killing shorting stocks this week day trading? 
2941 2018-12-08 00:58:41 Les belges qui habitent à la frontière de la france tout ce qu'ils savent faire c'est vider nos rayons et nos stocks de bouteilles d'eau 
2942 2018-12-08 00:57:23 Same here... I lost both parents to horrible cancer. They left all 7 of us stocks. As horrific as that was, this just shits all over them again. They worked their asses off to surprise us all with that gift...
2943 2018-12-08 00:57:09 Stocks, prison, banishment  it's simple.
2944 2018-12-08 00:56:26 For sure, Rex Tillerson didn't bankrupt ExxonMobile,a job he held onto for 40 years. In fact he retired with $300 million in cash, stocks, and bonds, and has a wife of 32 years, a wife who didn't start her career as a high-class, low-browed hooker. And, she speaks fluent English.
2945 2018-12-08 00:55:40 Just not liking the USA Lithium Sector ETF LIT Charts , LT momentum indicator indicates a possible deep cut on the way . 200 DEMA at USD 32.52 is a powerful resistance. Staying away from all Ca / Au Li stocks except a position in NVA:ASX. Li bulls will be unhappy ofcourse.
2946 2018-12-08 00:55:31 Yes God it was, and to put the cherry on the icing,  stocks fell another 558 points today giving yet another reason  for the rich to turn against Trump. Thank you God
2947 2018-12-08 00:51:49 trump really sucks at negotiations.  He lied about a trade deal with  China putting trump and the USA behind the 8ball.  Now China knows they  have the upper hand because trump has to deliver something.  USA stocks  down 4.5% ..China stocks up for the week
2948 2018-12-08 00:51:13 trump really sucks at negotiations.  He lied about a trade deal with China putting trump and the USA behind the 8ball.  Now China knows they have the upper hand because trump has to deliver something.  USA stocks down 4.5% ..China stocks up for the week
2949 2018-12-08 00:50:41 I need to be doing an essay about stocks but instead I’m watching soap cutting videos what is wrong with me
2950 2018-12-08 00:50:16 New matchmaking system sucks.  I just want a way to play 2/3 stocks on fd/bf with no items
2951 2018-12-08 00:49:55 Just quit already. Everyone including Republicans are of your lies, your whines, & your lack of being presidential.
All your butt hurting causing stocks to crash. And when you hurt rich people money you are thru

2952 2018-12-08 00:49:36 Lmao. Wasn’t this piggy at 235 just a few months ago? I guess 50% drops on mega cap S&P 500 stocks is the new norm in the financial markets.
2953 2018-12-08 00:49:15 Aww. How cute. She’s a bear. Plenty of new stocks making all time highs today. I wouldn’t call it a bear market. I’d call the last year a “line.” Most likely a line of accumulation.
2954 2018-12-08 00:48:04 Stocks down 4.5% in this week and down 1.5% for the year after it was discovered trump lied about a China deal.   Europe was lower but China was higher.  Gold rallied 2%.  Oil was up slightly.  Fed is hinting on holding on  interest rate increases because of trump??
2955 2018-12-08 00:47:53 I am Donald I, me and myself   I live on your taxes   thank you for bid salary    I do insult everyone I can   and I make all stocks go down   basically    the opposite of my campaign slogan   I make America small again
2956 2018-12-08 00:47:18 Australia heading for a v difficult 2019 , real tight liquidity conditions next year, general markets and resource sector ( other than PM) as well as Real Estate will seriously test all investors. Expecting Au PM stocks will massively outperform all other stocks/asset classes.
2957 2018-12-08 00:46:31 How is this not already a thing? As a staff accountant making $45k a year I wasn’t allowed to buy and sell stocks. As someone who didn’t even sign off on audit opinions I wasn’t allowed to buy and sell stocks. It’s unconscionable that this is allowed for lawmakers
2958 2018-12-08 00:46:13 Yeah , in the real world where we are holding multiple stocks I think the % is probbaly like 5-10% right now . Most folks are flat to red now.
2959 2018-12-08 00:44:35 I don't care for the status quo, but I do care for competence. It's not enough to just want to disrupt things if the disruption is making things worse. We should want a disruption for the better. How much have you lost in stocks this year because of Tariff Man? Yeah, me too.
2960 2018-12-08 00:42:32 Is that why stocks are in free fall?
2961 2018-12-08 00:42:15 I still have stocks on my Gen one, I’m just waiting to get another set of tires for the Gen 2 wheels that my buddy gave to me
2962 2018-12-08 00:41:40 Each player will start with a traditional 50 stocks, or 'lives',
2963 2018-12-08 00:41:37 I just bought 553 shares of stocks with what I made in dividends off of my other stocks..
I don't know what I'm doing, but I just wanted to make a note of it in case I forget by next year on this date...

2964 2018-12-08 00:41:25 Do you think this will have a big impact on pot stocks Monday?
2965 2018-12-08 00:40:55 My tech stocks have taken a beating with this market correction. I think I should divest. If we're really headed for a recession, things won't get any better.
2966 2018-12-08 00:40:36 oh noo im 5.5 UK :(((( nabasa ko lang ngayon na may basket patent sa trinoma at akala ko swerte ako dahil sabi ng mom ko pupunta siya sa trinoma today PERO WALA NAMANG STOCKS ANO BA SJDJDJS
2967 2018-12-08 00:39:47 Australian batting stocks are in a phase of transition and the failings of a generation at the management level is bearing fruit now. Give whoever is picked a break. Once the series is complete re-assess. The revolving door is breathtaking.
2968 2018-12-08 00:39:43 Hillary was the American Choice, she is the real winner. Think how everything would be different. Would not have all corruption, criminal activity, stocks, environment trade problems like today caused by Donald. Put Americans chosen President in office and jail Trump already!
2969 2018-12-08 00:39:10 I heard you can short stocks too
2970 2018-12-08 00:38:51 I am getting stocks short in delivery trades in about 2-4% of trades in last 15 days with Sharekhan. Request traders to share their experiences. Is the case same with all brokers ? #nifty #Nifty50
2971 2018-12-08 00:38:01 Copper stocks still not willing to perform effectively , why ?
Is Dr.Copper sensing a global bearish phase scenario in 2019  ?
2972 2018-12-08 00:37:55 Stay with stocks Red Dog.  Your Northeastern upbringing is showing.  We love Trump in the South!
2973 2018-12-08 00:37:54 @jimcramer jim what’s the deal?
i have been an avid fan for years yet when i ask you about pot stocks you blow me off?
are you against investing in them?
2974 2018-12-08 00:36:56 RT @theblkwhtco: does anyone want to teach me about stocks and investing?
2975 2018-12-08 00:36:35 i mean really teh only thing else i did was when it stopped working to just kms and switch languages was make a second ruleset 3 stocks 7 minutes and fought a level 5 cpu to pass the 10 minute wait time. once you get down to chrom, i think you have to do story mode for them
2976 2018-12-08 00:35:41 He must have invested in stocks with our money!!
2977 2018-12-08 00:34:49 THERE'S ENOUGH STOCKS FOR EVERYONE
2978 2018-12-08 00:34:18 psa the science centre still stocks red label irn bru
2979 2018-12-08 00:33:32 make yg's stocks go down that's what
2980 2018-12-08 00:32:44 How many stocks do you have in the timber industry?
2981 2018-12-08 00:32:14 DOW down again on concerns of a US recession. Watch for Trump to start applying pressure to Jerome Powell to stop raising interest rates. Anyone investing in the market now is betting on this happening. The only thing that will make stocks have a sustained bounce. #ASX
2982 2018-12-08 00:32:13 32.Psychologically, it can be difficult to start buying stocks after weeks and even months of extreme market volatility. With that in mind, investors should always try and buy something on the follow-through day. IBD. Oh well, it didn't work out this time though. Let's move on.
2983 2018-12-08 00:31:42 does anyone want to teach me about stocks and investing?
2984 2018-12-08 00:29:54 It's not in reference to other stocks. I would have stated the same in any market conditions.
2985 2018-12-08 00:29:37 Went  to check stocks of pappu amrit left...there..
2986 2018-12-08 00:28:55 IMO energy stocks in general ( oil/uranium etc..,) cannot perform effectively in a global bear market scenario in 2019 , individual stocks may however perform, up to Chartists to take advantage of such cases.
2987 2018-12-08 00:28:54 Tucker must've been long stocks
2988 2018-12-08 00:28:39 Have you thought of hairshirts, flagellation in town square, the stocks?
2989 2018-12-08 00:27:17 So many stupid people with their comments on the original tweet. It’s no wonder these people are laughing stocks of the world. Their stupidity knows no bounds.
2990 2018-12-08 00:26:51 What's the rule for times like?? Income (dividend paying ) stocks right??
2991 2018-12-08 00:26:24 After this week and since Oct 2, only buy Alcohol stocks like $STZ maybe??
Thx again politicians. The world is watching. $SPY $IWM $AAPL $AMZN
2992 2018-12-08 00:25:40 Temporary, painful, tradable, shorten time frames for trading, uncorrelated natgas and other things are really moving up or down and require focus, suppy/demand of commods/stocks/bond etf's, get in there and make the money, take advantage of vol
2993 2018-12-08 00:23:54 Stocks look good! Carry on THOT.
2994 2018-12-08 00:23:45 Lol.  If i had stocks!  I just like to keep an eye on what the Orange Emperor claims to be his skill set.
2995 2018-12-08 00:23:39 1. Trump committed multiple felonies
2. Cohen going to pen
3. Heather Heyer murderer convicted
4. New AG named
5. House GOP grills Comey about HRC's emails
6. NC still fraudulent
7. Stocks plummet
8. Jobs lower than expected
9. Chris Matthews farted on air
Missing anything?
2996 2018-12-08 00:22:21 @lovestocktwist1 stocktwits is to provide opinion to the community about stocks traders follow, not to judge people what broker they use
2997 2018-12-08 00:21:49 STOCKS: Continue to sell rallies? Stock negatives include:
1) wealth index 
2) weak investor confidence (VIX) 
 3) negative trend 4) geopolitical tension.  
Positives are: 
1 ) stocks are near key support 
2) oversold
3) fed may back off interest rate hikes
4) Christmas rally???
2998 2018-12-08 00:21:44 There was no “racist bullshit”. 

And I did say I support universal background checks, banning bump stocks, ending the gun-show loophole. Mainly because none of those will do much harm. They likely won’t do much *good*, either. But they won’t hurt.
2999 2018-12-08 00:21:00 Friday PM Wrap: DowJ took a big hit closing down in the Red 558.72 pts and in response as money flowed out of stocks into bonds, great for rates, the benchmark bond closed strong in the Green @ $101.37, +28bps! #BetterCallGreg
3000 2018-12-08 00:21:00 When my day come to retire, I just want my stocks to fall align with my spirit..
3001 2018-12-08 00:18:59 For guys who track me : Platinum will be a huge outperformer over next two years, South Africa Platinum stocks will zoom much to the chagrin of SA eternal downrampers 
3002 2018-12-08 00:18:18 This Friday was really ugly and there was one comparison: Friday, Oct 16 1987:

I was live with another colleague watching Monday, Oct 19 1987. If it repeats next Monday, Dec 10, I have cash in hand to buy value stocks like V,KHC, SLB, ..high pressure on US-politics to deliver
3003 2018-12-08 00:16:32 Piñera sabe de stocks, poner y sacar dinero con intereses.Pomposa "industria de televisión"no puede manejarse con ese "talento financiero".
3004 2018-12-08 00:16:23 @realDonaldTrump U keep lying,won't change the facts.U will not get away with your crimes.Keep tweeting,maybe your base will believe u.What up with stocks???
3005 2018-12-08 00:15:57 Hi! Do you know if size 5.5 UK or 7 US is still avail or had a lot of stocks? I just found out now so im planning to go later 
3006 2018-12-08 00:15:55 But as long as it’s legal for senators to buy/sell - even stocks their committee work will influence - this will continue.
3007 2018-12-08 00:15:47 Fully loaded on Gold/Silver/Platinum miners & explorers, have been buying a lot last two days. Holding a few copper plays and uranium stocks.

 IMO Gold and Silver will be No.1 Performers over next many months. 

A one sided mega bet with no one on my side of the boat 
3008 2018-12-08 00:15:43 I will not touch any Big Pharma stocks.... it’s a sickness industry with full of side effects..
3009 2018-12-08 00:14:39 So #RexTillerson, ExxonMobil...."disciplined, highly process-oriented?" That the same ExxonMobil with poorly performing stocks and poorly maintained refineries and other facilities? THAT #ExxonMobil?
3010 2018-12-08 00:14:32 Jobless claims bottoming on a 3 month average is the most accurate indicator for economic peaks the last 7 business cycles.  They bottomed this year. Bottoming to economic peak ranges 4-10 months. ~ Economic peak is when stocks tend to stop going up. Just sayin.
3011 2018-12-08 00:14:17 GOLD COUNCIL stocks climb despite troubling geopolitical headlines
3012 2018-12-08 00:12:16 Final Smash is the finger snap, half of your stocks disappear.
3013 2018-12-08 00:12:16 And ill remember to put the settings on 2 stocks rather than 5 minutes.
3014 2018-12-08 00:10:59 Yeah trading stocks is a scam!
3015 2018-12-08 00:10:42 My financial advisor (a big nerd) tells me I need to diversify my portfolio with stocks other than Burger King and Gatorade
3016 2018-12-08 00:09:51 For the folks who track me: Gold and Silver have entered a bull market (may be an intermediate one , but possibly long term).Big upsides over next few /many months. GDX has broken out. Gold and Silver mining stocks will perform excellent.U have heard it here first @BlackAlex58
3017 2018-12-08 00:08:37 Headline: "Stocks heading for worst year since before Obama"
Well, well....
3018 2018-12-08 00:08:24 Certainly not in stocks. Possibly in silk tights, ruffles and powdered periwig,
3019 2018-12-08 00:08:04 Damn ! And I am holding longs in stocks ! 
3020 2018-12-08 00:07:45 I got news for ya Niel. DCVax isn't a drug, and great 'drugs' don't come out of OTC penny stocks.
3021 2018-12-08 00:07:05 @nytimes 

Traders in Seoul, South Korea, pushed the market down more
than 1.5%; stocks in Taiwan were down 2.3%, where those markets have been the
most stable in years. They are doing it to hurt American market.
3022 2018-12-08 00:06:37 If the #StockMarket has a few more weeks like this one it will eventually get back to fair value.

3024 2018-12-08 00:05:27 75k stocks? Is that the new stocks of upcoming noob assist/attack?
3025 2018-12-08 00:05:05 Aren’t your stocks doing better
3026 2018-12-08 00:04:24 I don’t take a day off, I study stocks weekends too. It’s a challenge and not work to me. I visit my kids (married, engaged) and when they’re gaming, I study. They have one word for me, “Borrrring”. Until they had to pay tuition, or travel, or.... now they say “All Right Dad!”
3027 2018-12-08 00:04:12 Nobody knows how to trade this correction that was called two months ago again better then @pjraitt and @IconicTrading let’s see how the Furus wipe out accounts now trying to play shorts. #daytrading #stocks #tradingmentor #Capomethod
3028 2018-12-08 00:01:52 It will only help him. The drop happened mostly post election. With the markets being scared of derailment by the Dems they are taking profits and hunkering down. Wonder how many of you have retirement plans with stocks/bonds? Wishing a market turn down hurts your nest egg too
3029 2018-12-08 00:01:38 The lighting could be improved on this one, like adding a glow to the lightning, the lightning itself should be placed into a distant perspective and be smaller, practice on chracter posing, photomanip and usage of stocks.
3030 2018-12-08 00:01:00 Y'all...real time...ala @mayawiley on @TheBeatWithAri ....Lettia James (first Black Woman Attorney General) comes into her job in January...The Michael Cohen filings seem to be able to work as "precendent" for #business #crime...#construction stocks WILL temper

3034 2018-12-07 23:59:49 What a week in markets. The story has changed. OPEC pull a buzzer beater on a deal to cut oil production. NFPs disappoint -- inflation not so much the fear, now it's slower growth. Treasuries up, stocks down. The next two weeks likely to be just as volatile.
3035 2018-12-07 23:59:37 name 1 thing more satisfying than watching people panic over stocks tanking
3036 2018-12-07 23:59:06 You do realize that all of the gold ever mined in human history is still in human hands. All of that gold is potential supply under the right conditions. For example, if they think of its worth in dollars--and think its worth is falling.

Mines add little to total stocks.
3037 2018-12-07 23:58:09 'Adobe' and 'Tesla' have proven that large cap Tech companies can be impeccable if they keep up with the day to day market issues down to the last penny.

I wonder if there's a way for 'Tech' and 'financial' stocks to form a symbiotic relationship until trade is resolved.
3038 2018-12-07 23:57:17 الشكر لكم على التفاعل مع كلامي..
3039 2018-12-07 23:56:41 It’s a bear market for stocks. Don’t need reasons. If or when recent lows break, will invite more institutional selling.
3040 2018-12-07 23:55:56 In the news tonight: If you had $10,000 in stocks in January 2018 you would now have $9,850 in stocks. 

Way to go Loopie.

3046 2018-12-07 23:52:31 You know how many people are not affected by the stock market dive? A lot. Because they don't own any stocks and they are to busy just trying to survive.
3047 2018-12-07 23:52:22 I’m starting to think I may have picked the wrong year to start buying stocks. Oh well, you’re either succeeding or learning. Looks like I’m getting a lesson in patience
3048 2018-12-07 23:51:56 Which reflect sales numbers and investor confidence. If sales are down, so do the value of the stocks. It’s not rocket science buddy.

3052 2018-12-07 23:59:49 What a week in markets. The story has changed. OPEC pull a buzzer beater on a deal to cut oil production. NFPs disappoint -- inflation not so much the fear, now it's slower growth. Treasuries up, stocks down. The next two weeks likely to be just as volatile.
3053 2018-12-07 23:59:37 name 1 thing more satisfying than watching people panic over stocks tanking
3054 2018-12-07 23:59:06 You do realize that all of the gold ever mined in human history is still in human hands. All of that gold is potential supply under the right conditions. For example, if they think of its worth in dollars--and think its worth is falling.

Mines add little to total stocks.
3055 2018-12-07 23:58:09 'Adobe' and 'Tesla' have proven that large cap Tech companies can be impeccable if they keep up with the day to day market issues down to the last penny.

I wonder if there's a way for 'Tech' and 'financial' stocks to form a symbiotic relationship until trade is resolved.
3056 2018-12-07 23:57:17 الشكر لكم على التفاعل مع كلامي..
3057 2018-12-07 23:56:41 It’s a bear market for stocks. Don’t need reasons. If or when recent lows break, will invite more institutional selling.
3058 2018-12-07 23:55:56 In the news tonight: If you had $10,000 in stocks in January 2018 you would now have $9,850 in stocks. 

Way to go Loopie.

3060 2018-12-07 23:54:20 NO. THEY WANT TO EARN A LIVING WAGE. THESE DISGUSTING TAX WINDFALLS WERE TOUTED AS A WAY FOR COMPANIES TO TRICKLE DOWN THAT MONEY TO WORKERS. 
THAT DIDNT HAPPEN. MONEY USED TO BUY BACK STOCKS.
NO ONE WANTS TO STEAL ANYONES WEALTH. 
PUT DOWN THAT CUP OF KOOLAID.  IT MAKES YOU DUMB
3061 2018-12-07 23:54:07 Is that #2 behind "why are my stocks going down"?
3062 2018-12-07 23:53:59 Well it seems he has ELQ stocks. That Edward left to the grandchildren he had no knowledge of..lol

3064 2018-12-07 23:52:31 You know how many people are not affected by the stock market dive? A lot. Because they don't own any stocks and they are to busy just trying to survive.
3065 2018-12-07 23:52:22 I’m starting to think I may have picked the wrong year to start buying stocks. Oh well, you’re either succeeding or learning. Looks like I’m getting a lesson in patience
3066 2018-12-07 23:51:56 Which reflect sales numbers and investor confidence. If sales are down, so do the value of the stocks. It’s not rocket science buddy.
3067 2018-12-07 23:50:53 If the Dbacks dont bring him back after letting Corbin, Pollack go and trading Goldy (for not even a starting rotation pitcher) then we are laughing stocks !!  Congrat Cards on giving up nothing for the best 1st baseman in National League

3069 2018-12-07 23:50:28 The S&P 500 was down 4.6% this week and is down 1.5% YTD. Over the past 3 weeks, U.S. #stocks have alternated between #gains and #losses of at least 3 percent. Not since the height of the #financial #crisis a decade ago have investors been faced with this kind of #volatility.

3071 2018-12-07 23:47:45 I'm just sooo glad I loaded up on all my favourite GOLD stocks today!! the way the markets are tanking GOLD is heading NORTH from here on in. Well done A  H____e

3073 2018-12-07 23:46:56 IT's the new 2018 Grifter movement.   Get inside info, buy stocks, or set up a PAC or lobbying business while you can get the inside game as a member of Congress.

How very Palinesque
3074 2018-12-07 23:46:44 Well good news is taxes are right around the corner. With trade deficit, stocks lower, and imploding deficit, then the tax whammy for most, any lie after that will be seen as such. There is not much russian bots can do to save him.
3075 2018-12-07 23:45:48 Good to buy stocks!
3076 2018-12-07 23:45:47 The total obsession by market prognosticators and media reports over technical analysis speaks to the reality that ppl have essentially turned off their fundamental thinking.  You will not find profitable stocks over a 3-5 year investment horizon by doing this.
3077 2018-12-07 23:45:45 Stocks down again bigly. #thanksdonnie
3078 2018-12-07 23:44:23 Not well enough- Stocks are down big time again!!!
3079 2018-12-07 23:43:07 Has nothing to do with it do you have stocks in carbon taxes taking more money from hard working Americas
3080 2018-12-07 23:42:37 Stocks plummet again today. Overall, negative for the year.
3081 2018-12-07 23:42:25 So like what's the deal with stocks? Like in general.

3083 2018-12-07 23:41:37 But you need to open investment at 5k then once you have you can buy stocks already
3084 2018-12-07 23:40:47 Awful! Millennials Trebucheted My Blue Chip Stocks !!
3085 2018-12-07 23:40:33 5 technology stocks slipped  on Thursday:
$MOMO -14.6%, $NPTN -16.1%, $MJCO -12.6%, $SGMA -20.1%, $ZDGE -11.3%
3086 2018-12-07 23:40:15 Seeing the decline in Samsung’s stocks only backs these estimates up.
3087 2018-12-07 23:40:08 Candy O have you tweeted anything condemning Agent Orange threatening private citizens, govt officials or public & private companies? You and @charliekirk11 are the laughing stocks on twitter.
3088 2018-12-07 23:39:57 Tim how much more did you think mj stocks went up the day of stz vs today? Look again
3089 2018-12-07 23:39:55 Bad day at the office for investors. Red everywhere on the stock market except maybe weed stocks.

3091 2018-12-07 23:37:54 I guess my bank manager is gonna give up calling to try to sell me stocks eh eh eh eh eh eh
3092 2018-12-07 23:36:56 With guys like that I don't think w's are important kinda like mark hunt and the Diaz bros. Losses dont lower their stocks cause they always put on entertaining fights
3093 2018-12-07 23:36:51 Nah, the one where you do a 10 minute timed game then restart into quick 1 stocks still works.
3094 2018-12-07 23:36:44 So far I lost a game againts Ridley, Little Mac and Daisy (don't ask). After about 3 games of regular smash 5 stocks I went over to the Classic mode and I was able to do all 3 Challengers again.
3095 2018-12-07 23:36:37 Ouch, good luck. Maybe the new Congress can rein in some of the admin's insanity-- these officials can't seem to stop saying stupid things or contradicting each other. 

At least unemployment is low & economy otherwise seems strong, so stocks may go back up before long (I hope).
3096 2018-12-07 23:35:52 Its called raising interest rates. Thats how you slow down market to stop bubbles.see no pres. Likes when fed raises rates makes the pres. Look bad by hurtin market. Repub or dem. Makes people buy more fixed assets and sell stocks.its really not that partisan
3097 2018-12-07 23:35:32 These are the 2 stocks in technology sector that yesterday hit all-time highs:
$CA, $MDB
3098 2018-12-07 23:35:16 You better sell your stocks because the DOW JONES will continue to slide down & you will continue to lose money. the time is now, sell or you will counting your loses & be sorry when is going to be too late
3099 2018-12-07 23:35:12 My stocks are slowly growing
3100 2018-12-07 23:34:50 So many people think they want more money. What they really want is more wealth. If you have a ton of stocks and bonds you have wealth, not money. Which would you rather have? You would only want it to be the money if you thought the stocks would fall. 1/2
3101 2018-12-07 23:33:25 Only thing up today was weed stocks....
3102 2018-12-07 23:32:57 Seems like a solid rule. How about red positions in stocks that happen to be relatively strong compared to rest of the market? For instance Twitter or JNJ today.
3103 2018-12-07 23:32:39 Great first half of the show today.  You should bottle it, and replay it on your days off. Some tech stocks drop 87% from their peaks, during bear markets. Shhhh @GaryKaltbaum

3106 2018-12-07 23:30:51 Been there done that. Let’s just say my three boys contributed to sky high Apple stocks.
3107 2018-12-07 23:30:50 Idk the model but we have a chevy 04 3500 dually with the stocks still in it. The brights are absolutely phenomenal in that truck and is part of the reason they are one of yhe last things that has been left stock on it.
3108 2018-12-07 23:29:56 In the Spring following rump’s election, “My stocks have already made  more money since rump’s been in office, then they did the whole time Obama was in office.”  My hubby told him he was full of shit.

BREAKING: Stocks sink again, continuing a dismal streak for markets; Dow Jones Industrial Average drops 500 points.
3114 2018-12-07 23:26:40 What do you drive exactly, like year wise. Some cars obviously have better headlights than others. Also like i said highlight caps tend to fog up. If im replacing them i might as well replace them with something that is better than the stocks. Which is why i got LEDs.
3115 2018-12-07 23:26:04 I remember when the NRA was FOR sensible and responsible gun ownership. Since that changed, they’ve not been worth much to me.

I don’t think I heard of bump stocks until the Vegas massacre, tbh. Assholes like that dude are the actual problem - which we should fix w/ or w/out 2A.
3116 2018-12-07 23:25:30 the reason konami fired hideo kojima was because he didn't put stocks on revolvers in mgsv

3117 2018-12-07 23:22:50 #Stocks down again? Great job #Trump! When you’re in #jail the stocks will go up again. Who are you blaming this time @realDonaldTrump ? #Mueller? #Comey? #Twitter? #MySpace? #PeteShelley?
3118 2018-12-07 23:22:39 So as far as having money readily available to me goes.. I’m pretty broke. BUT this year I added significantly to my 401k, Casey started a 401k, I received a decent amount of stocks, and I set up a savings account that is out of sight/out of mind with my dad’s life insurance
3119 2018-12-07 23:21:29 I live in Massachusetts, among strictest gun laws in US. I have no issues buying whatever I want legally. No bump stocks since this year but I dont need that to hunt or for home defense. I have no issues with common sense.
3120 2018-12-07 23:20:01 ...of the cost of owning a sports franchise. All the new teams entering the league aren’t skimping on the roster because they are building facilities. @PhilaUnion ownership is a complete joke and league laughing stocks!

3127 2018-12-07 23:13:28 Dragged out into the streets with Ivanka Jared don jr and Rudy GUILIANI put into stocks and all Americans would be allowed to spit on and urinate on all of them!
3128 2018-12-07 23:13:23 Man, it will be a great time to buy stocks once @realDonaldTrump is done fucking the economy like it was a porn star he paid.

(Unfortunately, we’re all Melania in this scenario.)
3129 2018-12-07 23:13:09 Is that right? Have you checked your stocks today?
3130 2018-12-07 23:12:36 Evidently the rumors that Cohen had good stuff

So it is back into the stocks you brigand.

3132 2018-12-07 23:11:19 Awath, What’s your take on the fact that the capital gains aspect of stocks operates as a system where current investors’ profits are dependent on the inflow of money from new investors?
3133 2018-12-07 23:11:09 Let's not forget your great work on stocks today.  My 401k can barely handle all the winning!

3137 2018-12-07 23:08:17 Two things I think of when comparing the dotcom to crypto:

1) Mcap from peak: 6.6T vs 0.3T
2) Use case differences. Stocks are useless. BTC is not.

Now, I'm not saying we won't capitulate further, but I highly doubt -99% will ever come.
3138 2018-12-07 23:08:16 Ok now bring the stocks up...
3139 2018-12-07 23:08:02 Under $60 to fill my suburban with 93 octane. I’m going out on a limb to say oil stocks aren’t doing well right now.
3140 2018-12-07 23:07:31 Hey @realDonaldTrump, you take credit for stocks go up, you get credit when it drops - The Dow dropped by 558 points on Friday, capping a wild week of trading that saw the blue-chip index lose close to 5 percent . It erased all gains for the year. #ThanksTrump

3146 2018-12-07 23:05:33 All of you trolls will pay end the end. Either being locked up, executed for you crimes or made out to be laughing stocks by the entire country. Everyone who supports our POTUS already points and laughs at how miserable and pathetic you trolls/shills are. It's so funny and sad!
3147 2018-12-07 23:02:41 At 35 followers now that is a whopping 10% increase! Better than how my stocks are doing.

3155 2018-12-07 22:56:42 And wasting our tax $$$$$ for a wasteful spite investigation while the deficit soars stocks are diving and a recession looms! Are we having prosperity yet? #MAGA
3156 2018-12-07 22:56:22 good for time pass-no use otherwise. You will not get Mercedes at the cost of Maruti. If these stocks were to trade low PE- GOD forbid the rest
3157 2018-12-07 22:55:02 I really need to learn more about stocks so I can invest in them
3158 2018-12-07 22:54:56 I landed in New York, pulled out my phone, and looked to see how my stocks were doing
3159 2018-12-07 22:54:27 Y’all voted for the Oompa Loompa cuz he’s a ‘businessman’ but stocks and the Dow are shit. Now what?
3160 2018-12-07 22:52:57 The stocks steady dropping, gas prices low....what the government trying to hide?
3161 2018-12-07 22:52:48 Honestly, if their invested, retirement, stocks and bonds, they wont speak up for #CPP. Conflict of interest. We got The Great Creator on our side, who really needs celebs? Their actors anyway. Just saying.
3162 2018-12-07 22:52:18 I would make a massive profit if I cashed out. I’m not planning to cash out for 5-7 years so for now it’s unrealized profit. I have ASX listed stocks that pay no dividend that have doubled in price.
3163 2018-12-07 22:51:52 Y’all president fucking up my stocks.
3164 2018-12-07 22:51:07 Number of people involved was way way less. OG’s or top CT folks only had a couple of hundred followers and with some exceptions in the thousands. The tougher the market the more people started trading stocks and forex. Others gambled with margin. Silently more and more left.
3165 2018-12-07 22:50:40 Another REASON TO IMPEACH TRUMP..unless trump goes, stocks will  continue declining.  Trump & his colleagues (1)disrupted  international trade (2 )caused Massive Deficits (3 alienated ALL our  trading partners...business and billionaires will turn on him @GOP @SenateGOP @HouseGOP
3166 2018-12-07 22:50:21 Bonds are rising because the Fed. Stocks aren't doing well right now because "muh feelings" of the elite. You know the same feelings that felt the economy would tank if Trump won and has been wrong for the last 24 months.
3167 2018-12-07 22:49:57 Good now I can afford some stocks to grab
3168 2018-12-07 22:49:54 Another REASON TO IMPEACH TRUMP... unless trump goes, stocks will continue declining.  Trump & his colleagues (1)disrupted international trade (2 )caused Massive Deficits (3 alienated ALL our trading partners...business and billionaires will turn on him @GOP @SenateGOP @HouseGOP
3169 2018-12-07 22:48:09 Stocks? What Did I Say? Okay My Take Is The Market Is Going To See A 300 To 400  Drop Monday But There Are Some Gems Out There To Buy. I'm Starting To Look More Toward Energy Stocks But A Lot Depends On Saudis Reaction To A Two Member OPEC ...
3170 2018-12-07 22:47:46 Ohh I forgot about his ELQ stocks! I can’t believe he’s a Q...he’s so dull and forgettable lol #gh
3171 2018-12-07 22:47:44 Well the world is in a mess, worse now thanks to your dad.
Let the women have a go of it may get better results.

Never happened under Obama.

3173 2018-12-07 22:46:41 Alright this quick play system sucks it legit hasn't giving what i wanted its been giving me ffas and 1vs1 3 stocks with 3 mins
3174 2018-12-07 22:46:30 Why are stocks crashing and bonds rallying?

I think those markets are too big to manipulate.
3175 2018-12-07 22:46:29 depends on the financial conditions indicator(which fed watches closely) stocks are a driver, but credit spreads and treasury rates are the biggest drivers. FC are still considered easy, so at this point december is prob a go. If credit spreads widen a lot more then maybe no.
3176 2018-12-07 22:46:05 Fang Stock Fall! well, the business model is the central point to find opportunities l !!! Which one is the best?

3183 2018-12-07 22:42:26 I wonder how of the returned capital goes straight into new biotech stocks?
3184 2018-12-07 22:42:21 Short your dog.  Short your cat.  Throw a dart at the stocks page.  Short that.  Buy a gun.  If the market goes up .... shoot yourself.
3185 2018-12-07 22:41:47 Sorry, he got through that phase because they allowed over shelf-life stocks to be supplied for a long time until stocks became available again. Perhaps that is the future for some going forward?
3186 2018-12-07 22:41:38 Yeah human nature hasn't changed since VOC stocks ;). From what I understand one of the key differences is that in '15 ppl were legit wondering if BTC would survive right?

3190 2018-12-07 22:39:55 most retail stocks fell after earnings and just continued downwards - just an observation
3191 2018-12-07 22:39:06 Trump is the one who just took away your precious bump stocks. No more full auto for potential mass shooters like yourself. Let me guess, you aren't upset about that cuz its president Garrison not Obama or Hillary taking away your gun rights.
3192 2018-12-07 22:39:03 Trump was reportedly shocked that Wall Street didn’t react more favorably to his fake trade deal with China

Stocks dropped precipitously, with the Dow ending the week down having wiped out its gains for the year. And for the life of him, Trump can’t figure out why #TrumpsTariffs
3193 2018-12-07 22:38:49 Looks like Mom squirrel doesn’t leave her babies until they’re ready to leave the nest. Mom stocks up food to last her through nursing time.

3199 2018-12-07 22:35:35 Deportations rose, ICE grew, stocks crashed. Yes, media has partisan bias, R vs D, but they're still center-right establishment.

Obama was pro:
- Bush tax cuts for rich
- Deregulation of banks
- Corporate subsidies
- Big oil
- War
- Gun

Pretty right-wing.

3209 2018-12-07 22:30:50 Why is the Trump Effect only affecting Canadian energy stocks then? Why not US or global ones as well?
3210 2018-12-07 22:30:11 Jacob, you realize no one takes you seriously, right?  From being barred from ever trading stocks to your ridiculous Mueller fiasco, you should really be hiding your head in shame.
3211 2018-12-07 22:29:38 @realDonaldTrump a trillion dollars. Because of your stupid tweets and uneducated policies. You should be investigated to see if you are shorting stocks.
3212 2018-12-07 22:29:27 Holy shit! Cron stocks shot up 
3213 2018-12-07 22:29:10 dami stocks ang cln sa marbel

3215 2018-12-07 22:28:41 It reminds me of the app Robin Hood so I'm assuming stocks
3216 2018-12-07 22:27:55 He is only responsible when stocks go up, common!
3217 2018-12-07 22:26:50 Stocks ridículo.

3223 2018-12-07 22:23:25 I’m confused? Soros is investing in energy stocks in 2015?

#GiganteDoBasquete #NBBnoFacebook
3228 2018-12-07 22:21:42 Stocks tumbled. Many say trade talks r slow, others just some uncertainty.
Let’s be sure, stocks R taking a beating bc trump’s dementia and pathetically stupid brain is waging a course of bankruptcy for.
3229 2018-12-07 22:21:41 Remember to always sell off your stocks when the market is really low or you will lose more money.  #buyhighselllow
3230 2018-12-07 22:20:10 Actually it’s a good time to get into stocks (in my unprofessional opinion).. one only loses in a down market when he sells, so only sell if you really really are going to need the money in the next 4/5 years
3231 2018-12-07 22:19:55 been shorting stocks for 30 years. never seen a release like this one.
3232 2018-12-07 22:19:54 GET SMALLER STOCKS
3233 2018-12-07 22:18:51 Agree on weakness in markets but tesla is Holding good and theres Some big players shorting so a break on 385 Will make shorts panic. Break Below 250 and its going to 180 but theres much easier money to be made shorting others stocks ,
3234 2018-12-07 22:17:38 Stocks right now are up and down bc no one knows what’s gonna happen with both mueller and China and Saudi Arabia. I can guarantee that if trump is indicted Dow falls below 17,000 within a week.
3235 2018-12-07 22:17:23 $SPY Mistake I keep seeing traders make, is just holding onto stocks; hoping they'll bounce back. It's a plan, just not a good one. $STUDY
3236 2018-12-07 22:17:12 What are you on about? Stocks are falling now and because of trump. Obama actually did help economy but most important he helped the world. Trump is about me and money and threatening. Two different things!
3237 2018-12-07 22:16:17 It will be beyond chaos. Civl war. I have been saying it for a while. U think stocks bad now, just wait if something like that happens
3238 2018-12-07 22:15:49 The poor get poorer. The motley crew of stocks hitting new 52-wk lows today includes:

3242 2018-12-07 22:13:54 Lol Obama left with 4.7 Unemployment rate booming economy..stock prices up ... 2 years 1.5 trillion dept and trade war makes him smarter.. he could road the wave no tax cuts ..negotiate the wall get of Twitter. Stocks down 500 again.
3243 2018-12-07 22:13:27 A guy in the mail office today asked if my feet get cold after seeing my Birkenstocks and socks ('stocks and socks). Little does he know lesbians are impervious to cold, I don't make the rules ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

3248 2018-12-07 22:12:25 The weekly Coppock Curve has a bearish bias for 26 of the 30 DJIA stocks
3249 2018-12-07 22:11:13 Not subtweeting any of my lovely comrades. It’s hard out here. I started doing this when being an indie band meant a P.O. Box full of letters/zines/ 7”s.  Most of you have no reference point for that. An indie community/economy not dependent on 11 tech stocks is unimaginable.
3250 2018-12-07 22:09:48 Typo. Abailability currently 65% and should be 80%. Also. Diesel stocks for Eskom and private generators will always be a challenge given limited refining capacity and import storage.
3251 2018-12-07 22:09:46 That and public humiliation. Three days in the stocks on the National Mall where we can throw rotted Big Macs and KFC at them.
3252 2018-12-07 22:09:20 Waaaaay easier to destroy the stock market than make it successful, would be nice to know who is shorting what stocks.
3253 2018-12-07 22:08:45 I told my mom the same about pot stocks.
3254 2018-12-07 22:08:33 @ReformedBroker stocks still down on the premise that Dems winning the house in the mid-terms.
3255 2018-12-07 22:08:10 Smash is a game I play a lot of. However: I only play it with my kids. We play with all the crazy items and stages, we don't play with stocks, I only have a loose idea of what high level play looks like, I don't have a main, I never look up tech. Highly recommend.

3261 2018-12-07 22:06:14 Almost $1 trillion has been wiped from the value of stocks in just four days of trading.
3262 2018-12-07 22:06:10 All this good economic news and the market's still selling off. Guess what? The market is a *forward-looking* mechanism. There is a real risk that this #TradeWar gets out of control. If it does, you will get your bad economic data in a year and stocks will be even lower.
3263 2018-12-07 22:05:32 No one has a right to use bump stocks.
3264 2018-12-07 22:05:30 Yeah that’s actually what I’m leaning towards. Cyber stocks and growth is the fastest growing yet! Thanks. I needed a little help.
3265 2018-12-07 22:05:16 Most investors who buy stocks believe they are investing in the long term growth of a company. Short sellers are gamblers and bail out at the first sign of trouble.
3266 2018-12-07 22:04:47 Dow dropped another 500 points. 2018 might become a year that almost everything (stocks bonds commodities, hedge funds) is down. Will cash and lowvol be the one eyed king in the land of the blind? 
3267 2018-12-07 22:04:15 Do you not think that stocks, over a long term basis, have an upward bias? There are bear markets and crap companies that one can profit off, but generally speaking, over the last hundred years, equity prices have gone up. I'd say bears are going against the grain at least, no?

3276 2018-12-07 21:57:21 Market now negative for 2018, but is that bad? Stocks aren’t up, but not way down…so vital wake up call re: volatility without painful drop

3278 2018-12-07 21:56:25 Might as well buy some stocks in a good coffee company

3281 2018-12-07 21:55:04 Canadian energy stocks are dead. Could not move up even with big news like today.
3282 2018-12-07 21:54:49 What're the rules on throwing things at the person in the stocks? Would the heft of the objects being thrown be commensurate with the crime committed or would it just be a free-for-all?
3283 2018-12-07 21:53:49 kass lives on twitter cause he's narcissist. 95% on real money ?? LOL yeah right.  funny kass doesnt mention his massive losses in banks stocks and SQ, my God..
3284 2018-12-07 21:53:35 It's funny how those that think they know how the economy works. Trump inherited no jobs. 401ks 
down. Those that can hire created the jobs that Obama said you didn't build that.
But they did. As for stocks.
Wall Street controls that.
My money is not in the market.
3285 2018-12-07 21:53:25 The only thing this would prevent is a few good Bible Belt citizens to go out to the hills and exercise their right for recreational use of bump stocks.
3286 2018-12-07 21:52:33 $OSTK Another one day wonder. Many failed breakout attempts on stocks in this market. $SPY The last thing you want to do is chase stocks.
3287 2018-12-07 21:50:14 How'd stocks do this week, expert?
3288 2018-12-07 21:50:01 it will do more than outperform stocks lol. you can see the way things are going. but i know one company thats gonna do well and thats @DeedToken there going to explode in the real estate industry.
3289 2018-12-07 21:49:32 Salut @CaelanEuw, apparemment c'est toi qui t'occupe de la boutique toussatoussa, j'aimerais m'offrir un bonnet @SolaryTV pour Noël, est-ce que tu peux me dire s'il y aura de nouveaux stocks avant? Merci beaucoup, affection.
3290 2018-12-07 21:49:30 theoretically when Global stocks start to collapse this is a precursor to a world war, and in reality this planet is long over due for a major world war it's mathematical
3291 2018-12-07 21:49:19 E as bolsas americanas fecharam perto dos mínimos da sessão pela primeira vez em muitas sextas feiras, entra se no fim de semana com o credo na boca, sabendo que este ano o Natal vai ser mesmo patrocinado pelo Grinch. #crash #panic #desinflation #bubblepop #stocks
3292 2018-12-07 21:48:44 No, you didn't, I just threw that in for good measure. Bottom line, as Jedimarkus pointed out, seniors have been suckered in by central banks to buy an imprudent amount of equities in search for some return on their money. The younger gen: sucked in to believe stocks always go up
3293 2018-12-07 21:46:35 What great job has he done? Do you own personal stocks?  Do you invest in a 401K? If you answer yes to either of these ?’s, have you checked your losses lately?
3294 2018-12-07 21:46:34 @JR007 @Stockman00 Market conditions are always changing. Sell offs in growth stocks have happened in 1972 and in 2001.

3305 2018-12-07 21:42:23 How do you KNOW he's a billionaire?

And even if he is,  if he'd put Daddy's $400 million into stocks, he would have made more money and not list $1.5 billion for stockholders, bondholders, and contractors.

Based on returns, I made a better return on my investments.

3314 2018-12-07 21:40:22 President Trump needs to do something about the stock market dropping. Stocks are still up by like 20% when compared to where they were over 2 years ago but we need the markets more stable or growing. Trump needs to fix this problem with China or we will lose or market gains.
3315 2018-12-07 21:40:04 Zucky boy is smart. Buy the stocks when they are low.
3316 2018-12-07 21:38:55 To be fair it was up like crazy a few days ago, stocks ride on more than just a tax cut tho. So trump can’t be blamed or given too much credit.  Lots of ppl are looking and seeing signs of another recession coming, and it will happen sometime. Always does it’s a big cycle
3317 2018-12-07 21:38:47 The lottery is the stupidity tax.

Stocks are the tax on optimism.
3318 2018-12-07 21:38:31 With respect to the stock slide, one must also look at the earnings multiple. Most stocks that took a slide have a multiple of earnings over 25x and most 35x-40x plus. The traditional number of 12x-18x has Benny exceeded indicating high risk.
3319 2018-12-07 21:38:11 Sorry for your loss. But did you ask Donald @realDonaldTrump about the ban on bump stocks that he promised ?
3320 2018-12-07 21:38:09 Oil up, stocks down, Trump sideways.
3321 2018-12-07 21:37:22 I know this is crazy but like, I think my words are causing the stocks to change.

3324 2018-12-07 21:34:59 If you ask questions in #fintwit you must actually execute using the information. Few people have read this book I can tell because I don't hear anyone talking about betting only on volatility in underlying stocks. I will forever know this can part of my strategy.

3327 2018-12-07 21:33:39 A trading career is based on learning from your errors,sizing only on A+ setups and always wiring out putting your money in something solid like real estate/metals.

3329 2018-12-07 21:32:36 I had the same feeling. It’s peculiar how badly stocks traded.

3332 2018-12-07 21:32:10 I started off in stocks and Forex, and made the switch to Crypto because i was attracted to the volatility :D
3333 2018-12-07 21:32:08 Not at all, I just look at (actually calculate) the intrinsic & relative values of 100's of stocks against each other.  Doing so allows me to rank stocks from least to most risky among a host of other factors.
3334 2018-12-07 21:31:51 The stocks also did not double under Obama.  They went up about 33% over 8 years (which is still impressive).  In 2 years, the stock market went up by more than it did in 8 years.

If you want to after Trump, go after how he chooses to do things, not the results of them.
3335 2018-12-07 21:31:45 Does Trump like his Sock Market that he created. Such a bumpy road for those with a buck trying to make 15 cents. But for those with millions it easy to make a million more. Just keep shorting the mess out of it. How those oil stocks, you make good money, taxes!!! @NancyPelosi

3337 2018-12-07 21:30:07 Remember that I started my "Value over Growth" Call from much higher levels on #FANG & FANG contingent stocks.  In prior Yr's I greatly favored Growth over Value.  There's a lot of factors at play.  But once Growth declines enough it becomes Value.
3338 2018-12-07 21:30:01 Looking forward to the rebound! Meanwhile great buying opportunity as stocks are discounted on highly profitable companies.
3339 2018-12-07 21:29:42 Gold and silver usually go up when stocks go down, investors look at something more secure.  Rn gold is like 1250 it was 1800 in 2013, I’m banking on it going up when we hit the recession soon
3340 2018-12-07 21:29:41 Starting to see good news get sold off a couple of examples:

Trump tweet China Trade talks doing good - Market doesn't care

Oil Prices go higher- Oil Stocks don't care 

Bullard Throwing everything he's got from the dovish side - Market down 2.3%

3343 2018-12-07 21:28:40 I disagree. If competitiveness matters when discussing skill then a match between Armada and a total scrub is non competitive and you would say it doesn't identify skill because he just JV5 stocks the guy. Skill can be identified independently from competition.

Thanks for the heads up and nagging. :)
3358 2018-12-07 21:23:58 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump why can’t U bring in @SteveForbesCEO to consult with? I voted for him to be president too for a reason. Get him on your team & stop killing my stocks.
3359 2018-12-07 21:23:50 As I say, watch & learn. Stocks are forward looking. All of the negatives you sited in the previous post are known & discounted in current prices. Positive catalysts will reverse sentiment & expectations & at some point upward momentum will beget more upward momentum.
3360 2018-12-07 21:23:21 You BETTER stop screwing around with China ... my stocks are going down and it is all your fault.  Hey Trump ... how’s that economy working for ya now?   No boasting ????
3361 2018-12-07 21:22:39 @cvpayne

Hence plunge in the markets. Sell high and buy low, which will start next year

3431 2018-12-07 21:04:06 Did you know that the gains and losses in the stock market are charted by algorithms in computer systems? Ups and downs aren't generally about sell offs. It just charts a few stocks.
3432 2018-12-07 21:03:54 I’m glad the market is closed. Did great with Futures. Stocks, let’s not talk about that.

3436 2018-12-07 21:02:59 Trump and FED chair Powell can influence the short-term direction of the market IF a bear market has not yet begun.  Is it too late? Will the big boys play ball before the market takes its now pre-ordained course.

3438 2018-12-07 21:02:03 #Gold has not yet given the danger signal. In the current environment, substantial flows into gold would signal that the financial markets are closing in on panic selling.

3469 2018-12-07 20:52:59 The Dow is down around 600 more today. Why? Could it b:

3474 2018-12-07 20:51:13 I find it comical. When stocks are falling TV folks say the economy is strong and selloffs are unwarranted but they site current economic data (backward looking). When stocks are rising they say the growth outlook is higher earnings forecasts are higher(forward looking).

3476 2018-12-07 20:49:19 It will be VERY difficult ... stocks will have horrendous connotation during the coming crisis because everyone will realize that Wall Street is nothing more than a "capital extraction machine" for elites!

3483 2018-12-07 20:46:16 I got carried away by the positive response on the trade truce. I had saved the cash for drop in stocks. Still put the cash to work when Nasdaq was down 10%.  Should I put more in since today is a big day down? Or do you see the downward trend going for a while?
3484 2018-12-07 20:45:38 Since the linchpin of your investment discipline is loading the boat with stocks having the greatest % of float held short, $ABEO and $VKTX have been great calls!

3554 2018-12-07 20:24:54 RT @WillBlackWriter: Should David Cameron be put in stocks and wheeled around markets up and down the UK?

LIKE = Yes

RT = FUCK YES

This could unite the UK

3555 2018-12-07 20:23:55 Stocks are up just over 25% since election night.. Oil is down over 30% since the peak in beginning of October and fell below $50 a barrel for first time in over a year just a week ago... tf you talking bout bruh
3556 2018-12-07 20:23:31 Initiated a small position in $ABBV today at 87.29 to increase Healthcare exposure and steady future dividend income. #stocks
3557 2018-12-07 20:22:55 The shift from defined benefit pensions to 401(k)s was one of the great injustices of the late 20th Century.
Working people generally didn't get a say in it, and it forced us into depending on stocks for retirement.

How many lost it all in 2008?  How many in the NEXT crash?
3558 2018-12-07 20:22:38 My mortgage rates have been lowered mid-day. Must mean Stocks are tanking again.
3559 2018-12-07 20:22:32 how about instead of stocks and bonds, you focus on bonding with your family
3560 2018-12-07 20:22:14 Looking at crypto and stocks like let these hoes drop, tryna get that holiday sale cop
3561 2018-12-07 20:21:48 Trump’s Tax Cuts gave businesses enough money to make it thru Trump Trade War so far but now the Trade War is hurting both the expectations and the actual business climate! Stocks and businesses need predictable expectations....not twists and turns from one day to the next! Sad!
3562 2018-12-07 20:21:19 Markets Right Now: Stocks plunge again, led by technology
3563 2018-12-07 20:21:01 I guess I'm the only one buying stocks here?
3564 2018-12-07 20:20:13 My many years of experience in capital markets and bear markets specifically is that counter-trend rallies tend to be explosive, rip your face off type events. We may be getting to a point when selling exhausts itself and stocks have a lightning speed huge retracement. Be careful
3565 2018-12-07 20:20:04 Never tried it, worth checking! My thinking here is that household NW since the 90s is really nicely leading the business cycle. Even though stocks are in hands of the richest in general it seems to be a plausible variable to be included in a standard spread model specification.
3566 2018-12-07 20:19:51 But I am not sure stocks are falling because investors are looking at economic models or stocks are falling because China is pulling money out of the market.  I don't know.  I don't have access to the live data lol
3567 2018-12-07 20:19:13 Not really, I’d like to live a bear market to gain experience is the only thing I have never go through. And my IRA is getting affected believe me but I still daytrading on the side so I’m rebalancing. In the end with feds or not feds 90% of the stocks were x90% over valued.
3568 2018-12-07 20:18:54 I mean, yeah, as a rational human I agree. As a holder of stocks, it sucks.
3569 2018-12-07 20:18:06 how bout those stocks
3570 2018-12-07 20:17:59 اللهم امين وجميعا الغالي وجزاك الله خير 
3571 2018-12-07 20:17:50 Thank you Donald Trump, for fucking up my stocks you stupid BITCH. 
3572 2018-12-07 20:17:39 There is big chance that stock market will witness big fall on Monday

Tuesday, market will turn green and many option players and btst players will earn money

3575 2018-12-07 20:17:15 So thankful for rules of "selling some into strength" and "not letting a gain turn into a loss." #stocks
3576 2018-12-07 20:17:06 Gold and dollar are related, but so are stocks and bonds.  As confidence in US financial mkts fall, investors leave, and go to other lower priced investments.  Maybe we have a short panic out of EM that is the crescendo, and then $ falls and stocks fall and gold goes up like 2000
3577 2018-12-07 20:16:53 Nah I just shorted it at 52 when the trend broke, my panic buy signal had flashed prior at 60, auto stocks were diverging, and everyone said it was dirt cheap. I have an article coming soon hopefully, but it's technical plus simple cyclical earnings concepts.
3578 2018-12-07 20:16:53 U are putting us in a recession. stocks down. taxes up., tariffs costing us so much more.. where is the winning.  such a failed president.
3579 2018-12-07 20:16:38 Yeah one stocks. Whenever I beat a new challenger, close game and open it up again. Repeat. And that dude is from Castlevania I believe lmao
3580 2018-12-07 20:16:25 Well, I don't think that's going to help the market rally into the close. Maybe @POTUS is short stocks?? It's all becoming clearer.
3581 2018-12-07 20:16:24 Mine was about stocks or something. Shit was pretty good
3582 2018-12-07 20:15:31 Stocks on Wall Street fell sharply Friday, landing back in negative territory for the year.
3583 2018-12-07 20:15:27 Id rather see buybacks, and acquisitions, that can replace eventual loss in revenues. GILD tried the dividend route didn’t do anything for the stock. MRK a div stock was dead in water before keytruda. Growth moves stocks to the upside

3586 2018-12-07 20:15:13 How about stocks that have his bollocks hanging out the bottom? Steel toecaps supplied free of charge. Knowing that lot, he’d probably be into it.
3587 2018-12-07 20:14:51 The $ will, briefly rise against EM currencies, but only a little. Then all investors in $ denominated stuff will understand & leave for greener pastures, like EM; The $ will crash below old lows as rates keep rising, & you'll still be waiting for the dollar and stocks to go up.
3588 2018-12-07 20:14:30 That would suffice. Maybe a day in stocks in front of The Lincoln Memorial.
3589 2018-12-07 20:14:20 Stocks, unless you wanted that shit back. Ain’t no way I’m taking an accident $15k unless I’m told otherwise

I'm going to do this. Maybe I'll carry carrot stocks and pretend to smoke them.  Too silly?
3592 2018-12-07 20:13:30 Do you think people actually buy or sell stocks based on what the media is saying?  They have also called for 100's or recessions since 2011...Just saying....
3593 2018-12-07 20:13:23 Hey Tariff Man, stocks are tanking because you are dumber than Rex Tillerson.

3617 2018-12-07 20:07:09 Did I say that? I was saying: Trump hasn’t changed much of Obama’s economic plan. Meaning as long as Trump doesn’t do anything crazy, IE: trade wars, it’ll work like it has been since ‘09.
There wasn’t massive drops like this in the stocks until Trumps trade wars if memory serves

3672 2018-12-07 19:51:20 imo if one is inclined to buy in these markets then it should be defensive and preferably dividend paying quite simply as no one knows how low this market will go....we have had it too good for too long.....Most of my holdings are yielders - cashflow I will use to buy more stocks
3673 2018-12-07 19:51:19 Yeah, that’s how a bubble works.  Want to play the same game with 1990’s dot-com stocks or 2000’s mortgage-backed bonds?

3676 2018-12-07 19:50:46 Observation of fear in the market and/or systemic risk being priced in. VIX is also more tame today with stocks being down so much. Not nearly as scary as yesterday. Has nothing to do with position performance
3677 2018-12-07 19:50:29 what are “stocks”
3678 2018-12-07 19:49:12 FAKE NEWS from @CNBC  "Stocks off session lows".
3679 2018-12-07 19:49:07 That cnut should be put in the stocks
3680 2018-12-07 19:48:52 Old people are so salty they didn't sell their stocks at the top of the market. Even my father in law said I was a fool for selling, but who's the fool now? But hey what do I know I'm just a troll with the intelligence of an Uber driver

3687 2018-12-07 19:46:44 I didn't know you made stocks during the war.
3688 2018-12-07 19:46:15 Some of the stocks I've been looking at are getting near buying territory. Knowing my luck the market is about to spring up right before they hit their price points . I'm not worried about this downturn though. Earnings are still strong and the economy is doing well. #Stayhappy
3689 2018-12-07 19:45:59 Two reasons.  Shorts are a legitimate part of price discovery and the uptick rule when in existence prices stocks at a lower value than without it.

3699 2018-12-07 19:42:27 So stocks continue to freefall; jobs report sucks; OPEC to decrease output which will mean higher gas prices...is this winning? Is this #MAGA??? @realDonaldTrump runs the country like his business into the ground!

3702 2018-12-07 19:41:43 10 matches

I set the following rules:

3 stocks

No items

10 matches 

Try to guess how many times I got what I asked for.

What I payed for.

Hint: it’s below 1

3709 2018-12-07 19:39:34 NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks sink again, continuing a dismal streak for markets; Dow Jones Industrial Average drops 500 points.
3710 2018-12-07 19:39:33 If the fleet hadn't been cut then there would't be a haddock, cod or whiting to be had from our waters today. The stocks were almost wiped out, not by foreigners, but by a bloated fleet of Scottish pair trawlers and pair seiners.
3711 2018-12-07 19:39:08 You can make money on a market going down, too. Trumps cronies and family are probably shorting stocks and getting richer as The Don drives them down.
3712 2018-12-07 19:38:24 I have been saying for years that @tim_cook is not a good CEO.  He knows how to buy stock at 10 billion year highs…no innovation, shitty phone, shitty keyboard.  Its a mature category.  iTunes Store stocks - SPOT way better.  Netflix way better

3717 2018-12-07 19:36:53 As a former fisherman/boat owner I can categorically say that this is utter shite. The only reason we have healthy white fish stocks today is because of EU intervention with quota enforcement and fleet decommissioning in the early 90's.
3718 2018-12-07 19:36:23 These QC's need a 3 strikes & your out, for trying to pull this shit.

I'm trying not to judge but ...
3722 2018-12-07 19:35:55 You lost that loving feeling #stocks . Don't you love me anymore? Did @realDonaldTrump  hurt you?

Thank you
3724 2018-12-07 19:34:42 Stocks go up and down. But they never peaked as high until Trump. During his present term there were record highs.

3727 2018-12-07 19:32:58 #Stocks,#Indexes Yesterday a rally followed. That is no guarantee of the same today. Such poor signals may be followed by about a 1-day rally, or none.  We simply report signals as they occur, and note their strength, with which rally duration is known to correlate.
3728 2018-12-07 19:31:41 Same rules apply for me as well if I am buying option or the underlying stock since momentum stocks will almost always move within a week or two of base completion.   And the R/R is extremely skewed in your favor even if you are paying a bit more for the extra few weeks of time.
3729 2018-12-07 19:31:32 #Gold sends a strong signal as it reached 1250 USD among speculations that the #FED won't raise rates again soon. If you don't have any in your #portfolio, add some now - it's a great #diversifier! (also look at precious metals mining stocks that were beaten down the past years!)

3731 2018-12-07 19:30:37 Should have gotten out of stocks  6 months ago, then. If you jump to something just maintaining, then wait til stocks are back up, you lose. If out 6 mos ago, then getting in now, you gain.

3738 2018-12-07 19:28:24 Economics students finished their GDP questions, then worked on their Stock Market Portfolios. The stocks have been pretty hard on a lot of our students this week.
3739 2018-12-07 19:27:57 If @realDonaldTrump are concerned about the #stockmarket turn your attention to programmed algorithmic trading that’s skewing the intrinsic value of stocks based on machine learning and not fundamentals and restoring the uptick rule
3740 2018-12-07 19:27:36 wtf...Altria has invested $1.8 billion into marijuana stocks. Robots on Mars, quantum computing, weed being a legal industry with investments...

The future is now.
3741 2018-12-07 19:27:07 Or as I've been saying for months... #Fed is the one crushing stocks via its #QT policies but needs a #crash to do a 180 back to #QE. Why the Fed? Easier to stimulate a market down 30% than at ATHs. Trade war just the smokescreen for the #Fed's plan all along.
3742 2018-12-07 19:27:02 Given some of the yobbo element on the streets these days, I think we should bring  stocks back in to service!  Rotten veg, take aim, fire...
3743 2018-12-07 19:27:01 What makes big market declines are human behavior- stocks tend to go way below intrinsic value just like they can overshoot significantly- better be comfortable w/ what's in your porftfolio if mkt gets weaker and willing/able to buy more- just sayin...

3749 2018-12-07 19:24:17 So stocks go up it Obama. Stocks go down its Trump. So tell me when Obama was in office and the stocks were down whose fault was it then? Trumps I suppose
3750 2018-12-07 19:24:17 The New attorney General is one of the pioneers of the war on drugs. Huge supporter for mass prison incarceration. Be cautious out there in Marijuana Stocks for the next week or so. We might not see a run until next ER.

3756 2018-12-07 19:22:57 Gold has not yet given the danger signal.  In the current environment, substantial flows into gold would signal that the financial markets are closing in on panic selling.  The movement into Treasuries recently is only a way station on the way to panic.

3758 2018-12-07 19:22:16 Think about how you may have stock investments, but you probably avoid margin-trading on the stock market -- bc you don't want your stocks sold when price falls. "Flight to safety" assets like Treasuries or bunds are much safer collateral to use as a borrower. 2/
3759 2018-12-07 19:22:00 Truly wild to think about how much money I’d have now if someone gave me like $10,000 when I was 12 and told me to buy whatever stocks I wanted to
3760 2018-12-07 19:21:44 If you look back on Fridays when the market looks like it is about to crack, buyers have always shown up in the last hour...Here we are yet again, if they don't and we sell off into the close you are setting up a gap down crash like sell signal into next week #stocks #share2steem

3803 2018-12-07 19:08:35 Sweet! - Just be a bit careful as there has to be some kind of bounce shortly. The Down is down over 530 points. Just a terrible week for stocks.

3806 2018-12-07 19:07:33 SESTA and FOSTA are intended for cracking down on illegal sex trafficking and distribution of CP and child prostition. Both Tumblr and Facebook took the lazy way out and their stocks are suffering for it. Don't blame the government for web devs being a bunch of schmucks.

Appears that nothing you do gives you any leverage with anyone.  

You're just saying shit and hoping it becomes real.

3874 2018-12-07 18:50:06 I didn't lose in those stocks, thankfully, just follow some of the "gurus" who run services, like Superman and @Professor_Money who is another joke.  Both will tout their winners all day long, then ignore their massive losses to suck in more paying sheep.  All are so shady.
3875 2018-12-07 18:50:03 Your own administration can’t agree on what lies come out of your office 

Dow fell 400 points Friday. The Nasdaq lost 2%, while the S&P 500 retreated 1.5%.

Stocks had been trading higher early, but the turned sharply lower following conflicting messages coming out of the WH
3876 2018-12-07 18:50:02 Gap up in several pot stocks like $ACB is telling me it's buy day!
3877 2018-12-07 18:49:41 I hope those stocks falling are the no production stocks like SM.
3878 2018-12-07 18:49:37 At midday, Mortgage Bonds are near unchanged while Stocks decline on falling tech shares, trade confusion with China. 10-yr yield 2.87%.

3881 2018-12-07 18:48:28 Way to respond to lying. Clearly character doesn’t matter to you. Which begs the question what does? Keep up the cult membership. Blue tsunami, trade war , stocks plunging , deficit rising , Mueller coming. Tired of winning yet? Hahahahaha
3882 2018-12-07 18:47:29 When interviewed about bitcoin and gold a couple years ago, Trump said he doesn’t hold either gold or bitcoin as investment. He only has stocks and real estates. That should answer your question

3884 2018-12-07 18:46:43 Exactly! Just be truthful.  Only they won’t because if they made an announcement like this their stocks would probably tank.

3888 2018-12-07 18:45:39 I also have a huge investment in Aphria but if you diversify the rest will help you cover some losses. These guys are slick weasles shaking up stocks for their profit. There would be instances that I'd sell at a loss but not this time. It will be okay. Don't let this scare you.
3889 2018-12-07 18:45:35 Truly  the wrong hill  to die on. If u fight for bump stocks u could very well force a court to tighten regulation on semis of all sorts and pistols as well. U need to expand the ol overton window. If defacto autos can not be regulated...... what choice do u give the court?
3890 2018-12-07 18:45:16 #US stocks resumed their decline Friday, with technology shares again bearing the brunt of selling as the #Trump administration pressed its trade war with #China and the latest batch of economic data added to concern that growth has peaked!

3894 2018-12-07 18:43:49 Dow is correcting, you dont know what plunging is plunging is like in 1987 when 800 drop in 2 days  near cut Dow in Half... a 1000 point drop  from 25,000-24,000 is not a plunge its a correction, prices drop enough, buyers will move in to buy up cheaper stocks pushing it back up

3903 2018-12-07 18:40:15 One thing I have learned as a new trader is When you trade stocks make sure you are well aware when the boat has left you behind so that you don’t chase it! Meaning don’t trade if you miss your setup!
3904 2018-12-07 18:39:42 Also, if stocks fall ANY further...

3923 2018-12-07 18:33:08 All the metrics used by Trump to gauge his econ success are failing him. Stocks at loss for year, trade def growing, debt growing, stag wages, unemploy numbs disappointing. At some point intrst rates will go up and thatll be ballgame. If he lasts, he will own the next recession.

3936 2018-12-07 18:27:08 I started in summer of 08 and put my money in energy and fertilizer stocks, so yeah, I hear ya... Most are too over-confident at the start and end up seriously drawing down their account so you're already doing better.

3958 2018-12-07 18:17:31 the @federalreserve must believe using more of what didnt fix it b4 will fix it now? Same CB that missed 2007 recession signals.

3959 2018-12-07 18:17:23 For those stressing about the markets right now just keep your powder dry and try to think of it this way:

3967 2018-12-07 18:14:21 Increased demand in general leads to price rise and increased supply leads to fall of price in real life. Same holds true for stock market.
Dynamics of Demand and Supply is also like in real life. When certain stocks are sold in bulk(dumped) price falls drastically.(1/2)

4058 2018-12-07 17:45:58 Market cap of Cannabis stocks, excluding PW Pharmaceuticals, is 27 billion. For this stock price to be sustainable they need profits around 1.2 billion meaning 32$ per Canadian citizen. With margins of 20% means every Canadian (0-110 years old) needs to spend 160 $ a year on Cann

4060 2018-12-07 17:45:33 + if one goes back to the basics and buys low debt stocks with good n.p.margins @ single digit p/e inorder to protect against p/e contraction... questions of mgmt integrity+bogus financial statements come up , stock further derating happens
4061 2018-12-07 17:45:04 I'm sorry to be a broken record.  Neither on TV nor Twitter do I read why stocks have no bid -- aside from well known issues.  
This catalyst had me short / defensive from August, and mainly since including now -- and that is liquidity as expressed  by Central bank balances.
4062 2018-12-07 17:45:02 1/2 Mr. Kamran I think you should learn about international economy as well. This time overall dollar is strong against all currencies I.e gbp, euro etc. stocks markets are lowest level of all the countries.
4063 2018-12-07 17:44:55 Other stuff is in play, but the only promising activity we've seen this week was the day Trump tweeted about reaching some agreement on tariffs with China. Stocks soared. Next day it came out that was a lie. They've been in freefall since (again).
4064 2018-12-07 17:44:50 $AAPL Holding $170 nicely. Bottom? Most analysts have a $230-$250 target. Apple has many suppliers for every part. No way anyone could know their demand. Same media bs before Q3 earnings which hit records and popped the stock $50. Bullish. #Stocks $DIA $SPY $QQQ $XLK $IVW
4065 2018-12-07 17:44:32 $iq deserves a spot next to $hmny as one of the worst stocks ever. Hate $iq.
4066 2018-12-07 17:44:06 So far the only place I’ve found that stocks it 
4067 2018-12-07 17:43:01 As I've written elsewhere, I don't think currency hedging overall is worth the additional cost, and you basically end up with US stocks, so why bother?
4068 2018-12-07 17:42:28 @realDonaldTrump THANK YOU!! Over the past few days I've made a small fortune on the stock market! Unfortunately - I started with a large one.... Reminder: Hoover had a great run with the stocks until the crash.
4069 2018-12-07 17:42:25 $ammj Just a matter of time before this revisits $1+.  May get acquired or just go up with the rest of the American Pot stocks IMO
4070 2018-12-07 17:41:45 They’re all shorting stocks so he has to keep an eye on his investments
4071 2018-12-07 17:41:08 He may be inspiring violence Buddy's not inspiring business investment, instead he's inspiring greed. Wall Street cashing in stocks dropping, downward spiral of loss in dollar terms worse than the Great Depression. Trump fault, but nobody's attacking him or GOP in media
4072 2018-12-07 17:41:01 With all due respect, easy to say "buy low, sell high". 

Kindly share 5 stocks with a low price to buy for us plebs.
4073 2018-12-07 17:40:04 I buy quarterly/yearly puts against momentum stocks and $SPY on spikes. I tend not to day-trade these, but weeks/months. 

The vast majority of my cash is in CD's paying less than 3% or in BIL or TLT. Trade money = <5% of my net worth, because I don't trust myself or the markets.
4074 2018-12-07 17:39:29 So from the read of it, sounds like smart beta=factor and smart beta index = Indexes that use factors to select stocks for index. They weight stocks by factor(s) instead of conventional weighting by capitalization. Smart beta etf/ fund is based on that smart index.
4075 2018-12-07 17:39:12 So good news. As of right now I still have a job for at least a month and this week is looking good for getting another extension to keep it longer. 

Just need to make it till Jan 15th to get my stocks.
4076 2018-12-07 17:38:21 I'm sorry to ask you...but do you know ANYTHING about stocks and stock market?

4093 2018-12-07 17:32:35 Remove Trump from office and his terriff from China.  Done.  Stocks go up, jobs go up, America spends, jobs increase.
4094 2018-12-07 17:32:35 Why is the stock market crashing, at this rate by the end of your second year stocks will be lower than when you took office. Stock market grew 140% under Obama
4095 2018-12-07 17:32:27 Gotta think as crazy as it sounds big pharma with their stocks at all time highs and biotechs getting killed they start taking these biotechs out to fill their pipelines over the next 6 months. I know it sounds crazy...
4096 2018-12-07 17:32:18 In a world of thousands of stocks, you only need a handful. Pick your battles. 

Understand the business. If it’s confusing, just pass.

Have a thesis so simple that you could tell it to a middle schooler. 

Complexity sounds smart and sexy but it isn’t necessary at all.
4097 2018-12-07 17:30:37 This is more an argument for going long the dollar than going long US stocks. Why not just currency hedge foreign stocks, which is cheap and easy these days?
4098 2018-12-07 17:30:22 Benefits of #ExitPolls

#1 Brings revenue to media by high TRP

#2 If against ruling party, helps stocks crash & some make enormous money by buying then

#3 No apologies required if proved wrong

#4 Can lobby with pol parties for giving fav exit polls

#5 Crap dished out as sense

Whether or not this $CRON news will hold stocks up and create a $STZ style run (unlikely) or be used as a liquidity event to distribute shares to eager beavers and continue the downtrend, will be a big tell for whether
4106 2018-12-07 17:27:35 quit ruining the economy Trump! If you resign Now Stocks will soar! Do America a favor and quit.
4107 2018-12-07 17:26:12 Honestly this is why i love having Nintendo Stocks. It’s just fucking cool to own a piece of something you love. Everyone keep buying the Switch and Super Smash Bros. Y’all funding my early retirement

4110 2018-12-07 17:23:32 6 months ago, I thought to myself “I’m 32 I should start investing in some stocks” 

I’ve lost $100 already. Serves me right for being a millennial who needs financial security.
4111 2018-12-07 17:23:17 You are killing it today- job growth missed bigly, stocks spiraling, tariffs out of control, and the deficit flying high! I can see why 49% think you are an economic genius  Glad to see you had a moment to reflect on how few people will be attending your funeral #CountOnOneHand
4112 2018-12-07 17:22:51 Another losing day on stocks, your numbers are useless.
4113 2018-12-07 17:22:45 And stocks continue their fall
4114 2018-12-07 17:22:32 You want to reallocate but you already took the loss. Move it and you won't be in stocks to make up when it rallies.

4120 2018-12-07 17:21:07 Stocks are sliding too.  The Dow’s down by 1.6% as of now.
4121 2018-12-07 17:20:30 #Gold's strong outperformance here vs most metals is reminiscent of 2008. #Palladium might be an exception but that market is thin. What's changed is that the mkt cap of financial assets vs gold stocks is FAR higher now and so potential gold outperformance is FAR higher too!
4122 2018-12-07 17:20:26 In case you have never seen a 20% pullback, this is when you actually buy stocks, not sell them. $IWM
4123 2018-12-07 17:20:13 In reality if you think about it.  If you are not retiring anytime soon.  A dip in the stock market is good for your 401k growth long term.  It's adding more stocks to your 401k at a lower price value
4124 2018-12-07 17:20:03 Sorry, but shouldn't we be looking at stocks in 2018?
4125 2018-12-07 17:19:58 I don't need that kind of negativity in my life. I'm avoiding my stocks and 403b until I have the courage to look.

4133 2018-12-07 17:16:49 I love to be long stocks. I love when there’s momentum.  I make a lot of money when we trend above the 8/21/50 Day** BUT- I’m not sure why after 9 years of gains.  Some are so upset about a corrective phase.  It happens!
4134 2018-12-07 17:16:46 I agree - just giving the historical context from glasgow from the 19th Century. Clearly the Flint, Michigan companies are happy to apply such outdated standards to their customers in 2018. Perhaps we should put them in the equivalent of a Victorian jail cell (after the stocks)?

4149 2018-12-07 17:13:22 @realDonaldTrump Private prison corporations lobbied to be able to indefinitely detain children. Then their stocks soared when Trump announced the family separation policy.

4160 2018-12-07 17:08:40 Sir, This is like TV anchors asking what is the target for Nifty?
The better question would have been, how many years one would want hold these stocks in their portfolio irrespective of the returns, assuming the Business fundamentals and Corp governance remain the same.

4178 2018-12-07 17:02:35 The GOP tax cut to the  Corporations and rich people was given in

America?
4179 2018-12-07 17:02:35 Why do you respect the hell out of @CitronResearch? Andrew Left just shorts overbought stocks, posts a tweet with inaccurate research, and then end his position shortly after he moves the market. Not a good person to get real info from.
4180 2018-12-07 17:02:24 I want to make a point … in 1987 we crashed and it had nothing to do with a recession …  prices were too high  and it resulted in a panic fed by derivative trading … point is economy didn't contract for that to happen... stocks CAN go down... I promise you....

4225 2018-12-07 16:41:24 Depends. I'm much more negative if you saw me talking particular stocks. Thing is my horizon is generally much longer than most here.  Crypto has extreme volatility (which doesn't bug me) so for me to dislike crypto long term I'd need something a lot more than a drawdown

4227 2018-12-07 16:40:07 That’s why today’s number means little.  In 2000, the economy reacted to stocks; not the other way around.

4237 2018-12-07 16:37:08 Since December 1969, the Dow went from 800 to 684 (or -14.5 per cent) in six months. Its previous peak, however, occurred in November 1968 at 985 (unemployment rate was 3.4 p.c. then). An overheated economy may be dangerous for stocks.

4294 2018-12-07 16:20:23 Well said sir ji.same applies if we do not apply  (value stocks) right idea we makes loss as well.
4295 2018-12-07 16:20:06 Yes, stocks if you own them. Meanwhile, they will need to pay almost $140M break fee.

4303 2018-12-07 16:17:52 Stocks stumble on news that the guy who hosted "The Apprentice" is actually the President and this wasn't all some weird dream we had.
4304 2018-12-07 16:17:28 Stocks always decline before corporate stock purchase dates and options vest dates...as if there is some unseen hand at work
4305 2018-12-07 16:17:24 Controversial, but no. That's not what we do. I'd like to see him apologise very publicly by saying he was wrong to promise to implement the result without having a super majority requirement and without leave having a clear meaning. Then put him in the stocks anyway...
4306 2018-12-07 16:16:57 I get that, but there’s a huge machine that is the gun lobby in the NRA that won’t let studies be done and propagate fear around confiscation in things like that that just won’t happen. Let’s do universal background checks let’s ban bump stocks, shit like that.
4307 2018-12-07 16:16:48 @InvResDynamics $PHM has got to be the most frustrating home stock. Home stocks have been up in spite of overall market declines and bad real estate news. Only a matter of time before they dump again, but still strange.
4308 2018-12-07 16:16:28 Already seeing quite a few stocks taking out their lows from yesterday's big reversal. This is why hammer candles need confirmation - you must see follow through the next day or at least consolidation $QQQ being red when $SPY was up was a pretty nice tell too
4309 2018-12-07 16:16:25 Whenever they talk about UK fish stocks I always think of slowly simmering lobster claws and crab shells then realise it's the actual fish in the sea...same with the sharp rise in knife crime. Or is it rise in sharp knife crime..

4311 2018-12-07 16:16:24 I have been to countless fishing ports where people say you could walk from one side to the other across the decks of fishing boats. Which is why we fished out stocks and they want to do it again.
4312 2018-12-07 16:16:22 Legality aside, bump stocks are stupid toys. They render the semi-automatic rifle inaccurate but more rounds per minute. NEVER will see one in a police or military application. No room for these gadgets in my gun safe.
4313 2018-12-07 16:16:11 This is getting really ridiculous, stocks are moving 3-5 % daily like nothing. Maybe with QE done/actually getting QT, are we getting the crazy empty HFT market everyone was talking about for years? Either way, its not pretty at all and damaging confidence big time.
4314 2018-12-07 16:15:57 #stocks @realDonaldTrump   We're just going to have to accept a negative year in the #stockmarket as the price for shaking "Tariff Man" #Trump out of the idiotic fantasy that he can pressure #China with tariffs and not harm the US economy.

4318 2018-12-07 16:14:07 MO investment helps weed stocks and adds credibility. I don't like it though. That would have happened anyway albeit at slower pace. And more importantly, the narrative that its a vice gains credence. In my view, it is not a vice.

4323 2018-12-07 16:13:10 Wrong, fully automatic weapons are illegal. Bump stocks turn semi automatic weapons into makeshift fully automatic weapons. They are a loophole to the law & have been used in mass murders of civilians. President Trump will always protect our 2A rights as should every President.

4327 2018-12-07 16:11:37 Yes, we citizens who have to survive on our IRAs and 401Ks in retirement have made absolutely no gains this year. Couldn't even get something out of interest from banks. Only the richest who have financial ppl controlling their (overseas) stocks keep gaining in wealth.
4328 2018-12-07 16:11:33 My best returns have come from stocks which were already up at least 100% from 52w low when I bought them. First 100% move, usually, is just the beginning.  

In this hard money environment, this is a very important key to remember when you are making your watchlist.

4371 2018-12-07 15:52:28 Not really. Lower real interest rates worldwide imply higher asset prices in general, yes. That does not mean that monetary policy only works through asset prices. Money does not magically flow into stocks without affecting anything else.
4372 2018-12-07 15:52:08 So then, are you comparing index investors with people who pick stocks on their own? How is that a fair comparison? 

Shouldn't you be comparing index investors with investors in actively managed funds?

4376 2018-12-07 15:49:54 Stocks trade on many things, with one of the biggest being instability in economic leadership. If traders and "programs" see constantly changing threats in monetary, fiscal and trade policy values go down.
4377 2018-12-07 15:49:42 Third straight day that stocks are down. I know Trump fans are saying if the Russia investigation wasn't going on he could focus more on the economy but my President had to deal with a republican house & Senate and the birther movement.

4420 2018-12-07 15:32:43 How many stocks should I own at any given time? Thats a question I was just asked by a new investor. My answer is, I only buy what I can afford to have held long enough to have (for me) long term gains. I like to have several. It’s a personal strategy. Short term I may have few.
4421 2018-12-07 15:32:32 This disconnect from fundamentals AND news is typical of penny stocks and fraudulent schemes. Just saying...

4451 2018-12-07 15:23:12 About options? I’d recommend taking the course at investopedia(it’s free) on options. They’re a somewhat counterintuitive methodology for buying or selling stocks, but they’re definitely much more powerful than actually buying or selling stocks and offer much more reward

4455 2018-12-07 15:21:51 It should shock more people that @tim_cook has failed to introduce a brand new Apple product as CEO, and he has not been fired.

4649 2018-12-07 14:16:03 The entire economy is based on 'manipulation' ...

1) Fed manipulates rates
2) CEOs manipulate stocks
3) Trump manipulates trade
4) OPEC manipulates oil

... and Wall Street manipulates the whole damn thing!

4662 2018-12-07 14:11:23 Stocks never have a certain direction, as they will continue to rise and fall given the current capital market situations. It is important to have a strategy when making investments and to choose one focused on fundamentally sound stocks.This is a ground rule for investments.
4663 2018-12-07 14:11:12 Agreed. Owning stocks over the long-term is the best way to get rich and buying at depressed levels makes this happen even faster. But I guess that message doesn't help sell fear and gloom

4720 2018-12-07 13:48:00 Economy dependent on bubbles to keep it robust or to enhance people's buying power. During the housing bubble people would refinance their home loans at a lower rate & go buy a new truck w the $$ they pulled out. Today stocks have taken on that role in a fragile real economy.
4721 2018-12-07 13:47:51 Which stocks did you short today?
4722 2018-12-07 13:46:01 This is still a Fed driven market or, in @EpsilonTheory terms, the "narrative of central bank omnipotence" is alive & well. A weak payroll / wage # just caused yields to fall and stock futures to rally (from neg levels) as an accommodating Fed trumps a strong econ for stocks.

4744 2018-12-07 13:40:33 my point is that someone is buying tech stocks because they see a potential good 2019 and they are hedging against the volatility that we are having this months and the volatility that we could see on the coming ones

4796 2018-12-07 13:24:15 @ThroughTheGaps  Might be wise for all parties to take a step back from the 2020 Cfp deadline of MSY 4 all stocks . Understanding has moved on from when this goal was set. Ask science @ices & others on how realistic this is in a fisheries/ecosystem context & time frame.
4797 2018-12-07 13:24:12 If world markets crumble all stocks will go down regardless. I have been involved in this sector for almost 4 years I don’t need to be told about the potential of the market. But doesn’t mean it’s gonna happen overnight. I would love this news to change the dynamics into
4798 2018-12-07 13:23:10 Buybacks could be good if pharma cos are saying 'we don't have super profitable R&D opportunities' so let's not carry all this equity capital. Buybacks could also reflect being annoying at short-term investors who've ditched their stocks and ignored long-term profitability.

4804 2018-12-07 13:20:44 There is nothing contradictory about both of you being “correct”. Altria’s stake is surely a secular investment and probably a starting point. With that said, cannabis businesses could be facing their first business cycle downturn and the stocks a mkt-wide bear market.
4805 2018-12-07 13:20:42 Who didn't see that coming?? Certainly Trump didn't really believe that the Chinese government wasn't going to start repaying the numerous insults and now the Chinese can manipulate US stocks thanx to Trump's bold lying by claiming that the deal was done

4847 2018-12-07 12:58:56 You cannot short IRA’s. If you had a smart advisor he would put you in funds that go up as the market goes down. Shorts make stocks go up quicker if the position is wrong. Look up short squeeze.

4907 2018-12-07 12:20:13 Most of the Multibaggers have been found where there is a lot of scepticism. Currently same is observed with SME stocks. I won't be surprised if this sector delivers a line of multibaggers in 2019

4975 2018-12-07 11:15:31 You can invest in equity through trading, direct stocks, PMS and mutual funds. Diversified Mutual Funds are the best way to invest in equities, says brijeshdalmia at #ETWIW
4976 2018-12-07 11:13:09 Bighit isn't publicly listed, so there aren't any stocks that could fall in the first place.
The article is somehow linking the stocks of some distant investors falling to BTS/BH...

4978 2018-12-07 11:12:23 I don't keep any of my 401(k) in those 30 stocks that make up the DJIA. Not a whole lot of growth opportunities there. It's safer, but you're still going to have your ups and downs.
4979 2018-12-07 11:12:16 Wages are stagnant, ppl getting laid off.   Stocks slipping, GDP helps no individuals paycheck.  That corporate tax scam is permanent.  It will not pay for itself.  Big deficit getting bigger.  Can you say recession is a coming.
4980 2018-12-07 11:12:02 In the 1780s there were food (wheat) shortages in France, because of bad harvests. The British had stocks of wheat so the French government asked them to sell them some. The British (William Pitt the Younger was the PM) refused, thinking it would make France weak. 1/2
4981 2018-12-07 11:10:26 The DJIA is not "the stock market". It's 30 stocks. There really needs to be better education about the stock markets (plural) and personal finance and investment in general.

5016 2018-12-07 10:36:43 Tesla “stocks” are “stocks”. Because they announced dividendeds would not be paid and money would be reinvested back into the company doesn’t suddenly not make it a stock. Stocks are classified as securities.
5017 2018-12-07 10:36:18 La baisse ne peut pas être immédiate à cause des stocks qui ont été acheté auparavant beaucoup plus cher....il faut arrêter la démagogie....
5018 2018-12-07 10:36:11 Hence, diversify. Across stocks, across assets.

5084 2018-12-07 09:36:59 Your questions are valid.. but 4% difference over 10 year period is huge.

QLTEF portfolio over 10y mostly limited to select quality stocks from Nifty 50 universe + low percentage of holdings from nifty next 50 stocks..

I believe there is a space for active & passive in a folio.

5191 2018-12-07 07:53:08 Thank you for the candid response. Then how do you invest directly into stocks.  As far as I know the consumer facing companies and mncs are termed as defensive and have high ROCE and RoA also good cash flows.  If we exclude them where to invest?
5192 2018-12-07 07:50:18 In response to @business the inflows by institutional investors in Qatari stocks is actually Qataris own money liquidated and brought back under different institutional names to ease investor fears. 
Reality is totally the opposite.

5204 2018-12-07 07:35:35 The only strategy that works is buying on average. The trend is obviously down, my feelings it will target 1k. Remember next year it will not be a good year for stocks and people will be depress , so not good time to find support for a massive demand for crypto

5213 2018-12-07 07:23:03 On that count, I agree with you, sir.

5238 2018-12-07 06:58:27 Less than 50% of ppl own stocks. Trade deficits are at record highs as is debt.

5365 2018-12-07 05:17:20 Honestly I don't think anyone is confident of anything right now #BTC . And if they are, be wary of them.... but look at stocks today, opened 800 pts down and then closed at even. The energy is very volatile right now.
5366 2018-12-07 05:15:37 Haha I'll try that "Charles Zidler was the original investor who traded in women rather than stocks" 
I think that's my angle done

5369 2018-12-07 05:12:24 Im hearing a lot about China potentially taking our corn but I'm not sure what they need it for.  Hog herds down, stocks adjusted dramatically upwards,etc.  is it realistic to anticipate that China will import our corn?
5370 2018-12-07 05:11:23 History rhymes... stocks show this behaviour..if it falls thru a major support level, it can go to zero quickly

2017 Christmas was a good time. People will compare & sell this year

5388 2018-12-07 05:01:41 There’s not enough historical data to support that, stocks have been in a bull run since the inception of bitcoin, yet crypto has been through 3 market cycles
5389 2018-12-07 05:01:03 The chopiness has made it very hard to trade.  Even when hedging vs a Benchmark single stocks have fallen or risen much higher then that benchmark

5392 2018-12-07 04:59:21 The wider problem with ETFs is liquidity. The market just doesn't seem to think of ETFs as viable alternatives to stocks or mutual funds. There are a few exceptions but for the most part ETFs suffer because of poor liquidity.

5397 2018-12-07 04:54:09 I guess my real question is this: should lack of stocks be a bigger warning sign than we make it out to be? Is there enough historical data to show it's troublesome for prospects?
5398 2018-12-07 04:54:02 The sell-off was again led by mutual funds which have dumped stocks worth $19m in the first week of the month.150bps hike in policy rate, commercial banking was the worst performing sector, dragging the index down by 290 points.

5400 2018-12-07 04:52:52 Stocks on sale! Or perhaps it is time for new sustained and steady leadership from the top of the country to the top of the board rooms.
5401 2018-12-07 04:51:57 Wrong, bump stocks aren't a conversion kit. I can bumpfire without a special stock, and there was something like 2 murders using automatic weapons in the 52 years between the nfa and the Hughes amendment. Everything you said was wrong.

5407 2018-12-07 04:46:03 You liberals are fantastic. When stocks are on the rise it has nothing to do with Trump. When stocks are callings it’s 100% Trump. It’s very entertaining to read. Gonna grab a beer and read some more.

5410 2018-12-07 04:44:38 what happened, graphite India is up 3.5%..

you need to understand that in bear market max stocks will fall, you cant just randomly say anything..if you hv articles to support the fall then there are more than double articles to support graphite story..
5411 2018-12-07 04:44:11 I thought so. Just curious & wanted to confirm I was assuming correctly that way I know if joining MIC would work or not. So sure trader has low cap stocks for shorting? Trade ideas would not have it at least on 1st day and then they would make it available.

Hello.
Do you guys apply the setup to different universe of stocks? Or are the logics applied are diff. (albeit may be slightly) from each other.
Bcoz both Telegram channels are giving out different alerts!
5418 2018-12-07 04:39:20 Broadly speaking, I see value in this space. Do your homework and pick moderately priced growth stocks among them.
5419 2018-12-07 04:39:05 Yes. We’ve already sold some of our personal stocks.
5420 2018-12-07 04:39:01 Haven't traded OTC stocks since 2012 since their peak. Trading options is similar, though.

5434 2018-12-07 04:29:30 Do you realize the more that you “spray fire” the less accurate you are and the fewer number of people get hit/hurt? If the jackass in Las Vegas didn’t use bump stocks, more people would have died because he would’ve been more accurate. Also, that caliber is good for wounding.
5435 2018-12-07 04:29:15 No they must not fund your wall. That’s just a waste of money. Obviously you don’t care the the deficit is up that stocks are down. You don’t care if you put the US in bankruptcy.

5441 2018-12-07 04:23:15 Consumption stocks PE multiples will come off only when investment-led sectors witness earnings growth. In india, only God knows when that will happen thanks to populist Govts.

Stick to stocks.
5443 2018-12-07 04:21:15 The problem is bitcoin has lost tons of trust. There are lots of governments and currencies and kinds of currencies including stocks, commodities and derivatives. Bitcoin has to be better than them all. But it's not even close.
5444 2018-12-07 04:19:52 Hm, I had an hour long conversation with a 65 yo client in a 30/70 portfolio losing his mind about the market (30% stocks).  He’s an outlier - most clients not seeming to notice right now.  Probably changes after annual statements are opened
5445 2018-12-07 04:19:43 In stark contrast with yesterday, my entire small cap watchlist is green and some of the stocks are up by over 5%.

5447 2018-12-07 04:18:44 If you are going to play the stocks, it's wisest to go for toothpaste or shoes. We know majority of humans will buy those new and you won't be just throwing money around, taking Russian roulette chances.

5449 2018-12-07 04:16:24 Hahaha sounds more like reporters don't know why stocks are moving...
Here's a tip,
World growth is slowing.
If world growth is slowing then so will corporate profits.
If profits are going down then so will share prices.
If share prices are going down then so will market indexes.

5454 2018-12-07 04:14:41 What the fuck do you think Trump is doing?  How do you think that tax cut is going to be paid for?  Have you bothered to think of that?  Where does that money come from?  Those corporations put it back into their own stocks.  That money has not gone back to the working class.

5460 2018-12-07 04:12:48 One important outcome of our perpetual trade deficit is that foreigners are investing in our economy. They can buy government bonds (helping to finance the government’s budget deficit), American corporate stocks and bonds, real estate (like Manhattan apartments)
5461 2018-12-07 04:12:33 Given your profession, would be interesting to hear your opinion on the possiblities for regulatory arbitrage using dai/augur/etc from other countries. What happens when future MKR tokens will be pegged to index funds, stocks, bonds, etc? Sounds pretty sweet to me...
5462 2018-12-07 04:11:41 Well, not less than most FAANG stocks now that they've shit themselves by 30% in the past few weeks too - but you're catching my drift....

5466 2018-12-07 04:10:13 If you wanna be popular, DO SOMETHING AMERICANS WANT. TRADE WAR= inflation+interest rates soaring, stocks, global economy,home values crashing+KILLING FARMERS. FIX ACA! END $1.5 TRILLION GIFT to corps for stock buy backs. Make Rosenstien AG! End War in Yemen! pick one..
5467 2018-12-07 04:10:01 This is the only solution, IMO. Charge all foreign holders of real and financial US assets an annual 2% tax. They will sell the houses, office buildings, bonds, stocks, and stop trying to accumulate USD assets. The trade deficit will disappear overnight.
5468 2018-12-07 04:09:56 Because stocks are heading much lower... writing is on the wall. Recession in 2019-2020.

Meanwhile crypto has declined all of 2018... so we’re close to the bottom with crypto. Not so with stocks which only started to really tank in October.
5469 2018-12-07 04:09:39 I was laid off August 2008. Because I had paid off my house and car in the two years prior (because stocks were too expensive, debt reduction made the most sense) and had a working DH I could actually get by on unemployment only.  It took 4 months to find a job.
5470 2018-12-07 04:09:36 Here’s an idea! Stop the self promoting and start doing something! How about just doing something positive! Resolve the DECA situation, ban bump stocks, end the tariffs to help the farmers, protect SS and Medicare, decrease drug costs to name a few of your promises!

4. sell the options?

I don't see any wise people would do 1 or 3.
5481 2018-12-07 03:59:38 No clear favourites. But too much nostalgia. I grew up watching my father wear one with a black dial. Every time I think of HMT, that's the first thing I think of. Want one so bad, but limited stocks = exorbitant pricing. 
5482 2018-12-07 03:59:21 Okay let’s say it’s the long game from you but why didn’t trump say it’s the long game when the stocks went up even though economist have said trump had nothing to do with it .. all I’m saying he should have the same energy from both side and he rarely ever does

5485 2018-12-07 03:57:30 teach me how to run stocks i got time
5486 2018-12-07 03:57:16 limited stocks so gotta get this bread!!
5487 2018-12-07 03:56:39 And many coastal communities also worry about the loss of chinook stocks and endangered resident orcas
5488 2018-12-07 03:55:48 The funny thing is that the indexes have hardly pulled back.  Yet so many great stocks are decimated. It’s annoying TBH.
5489 2018-12-07 03:54:59 I have mortgaged all my stocks with a bank in order to lock them for 20-30 years. Hence, I can't sell them in any circumstance
5490 2018-12-07 03:54:38 Stocks are too risky for this Manatee. Time to rotate into safe crypto!
5491 2018-12-07 03:53:58 Who you using for stocks? A service or a broker?
5492 2018-12-07 03:52:53 Why would you continue to HODL your crypto when you could plow what’s left into cheap stocks?
5493 2018-12-07 03:52:48 Any buyers on here im offering 2 fully functional ones at the same price ....hurry while stocks last
5494 2018-12-07 03:50:40 Stocks plunge hard as Huawei arrest renews China tensions
5495 2018-12-07 03:50:31 Nifty gains from 10200 to 10650 and rupee gains from 73.56 to 70.47 in one month & a week since 30th Oct 2018. Total 4% + 4% = 8% gains to FIIs & Chinese govt. Book profits and stay away from the stocks.
5496 2018-12-07 03:50:15 Everyone is rekt, i think it’s a leading indicator of the stocks too  I m in usd now  cash  king
5497 2018-12-07 03:49:45 I certainly hope stocks start a rebound tomorrow
5498 2018-12-07 03:49:13 So lying Trump said he’d “eliminate National Debt”.   INSTEAD—The Incompetent Bloviating Ignoramus INCREASED NATIONAL DEBT from about 8 TRILLION to OVER 19 TRILLION & lied about China deal. Stocks went up 300. But as lie discovered-Stock Market FELL 800 points. Welcome RECESSION
5499 2018-12-07 03:47:33 But that even happens in a portfolio too...out of 50 stocks only 10% or less gives super duper or abnormally high returns which compensates all other or bad choices 
5500 2018-12-07 03:46:52 many bullish  divergences on  spx , dow  ,stocks today
5501 2018-12-07 03:46:05 Canadians on the instruction from the US arrests Huawei CFO and sends stocks in Wall Street tumbling, I hope we won’t follow suit this morning when JSE opens.
5502 2018-12-07 03:44:33 I think Agri stocks will have a bull time today

Other stocks like kellton tech, Sakuma Exports could again have a follow up interest 

@BTVI
5503 2018-12-07 03:44:17 Too much tax related selling, next year might be great for stocks I agree
5504 2018-12-07 03:44:14 Market Breadth Picture
6 Dec 2018
Advance minus Decline at more than 1000 stocks
Third straight day market breadth in favor of decliners

28 Sept 2018
Advance minus Decline at more than 1339 stocks
Worst market breadth day in last 3 months 
Nifty declined over 5% in next one week
5505 2018-12-07 03:43:38 I don't see the need for hcm's. Not for protection. Also not a fan of bump stocks. Just my opinions and am comfortable debating. (2/2)
5506 2018-12-07 03:43:34 My expectation is for the correction to end in the region of 10440-300. If I were buying Indian stocks, I would start nibbling at current levels
5507 2018-12-07 03:43:32 Put Farage & Boris in stocks with him & send them on a tour now.
5508 2018-12-07 03:43:22 I have a friend that’s a Walmart employee and the pay him a base salary of over $360,000 plus substantial additional compensation like bonuses, stocks, stock options etc.
5509 2018-12-07 03:42:46 Responsible gun ownership, there are more regulations around a uterus & getting an abortion than purchasing a gun. People don’t need automatic weapons, bump stocks or hollow bullets. No rules or 48 hour waiting, no screening or parental permission, videos and not on every corner
5510 2018-12-07 03:42:44 Good or I prefer: “fair valued”... which means there are some winner trades to make right now. Some great stocks are currently on sale.
5511 2018-12-07 03:42:34 This is what happens when stocks take a dive and it becomes a bear market.
5512 2018-12-07 03:41:58 Great feed for both stocks and music!
5513 2018-12-07 03:41:44 Or Health Insurance Stocks :)
5514 2018-12-07 03:41:41 The only sales we would ban are assault weapons, high capacity magazines & bump stocks.  Other than that, anyone could own any gun they want, unless they’re a domestic violence offender, or found by a judge to be at immediate risk of using guns to harm themselves or others.
5515 2018-12-07 03:40:51 Did it? The CEO of MGM/Mandalay sold the majority of his stocks in the weeks leading up to the massacre. Although Soros was not interested in MGM stocks he shorted stocks prior to the incident. It's pretty doubtful that they'd be the only shrewd business people who lost. Plus 1/2
5516 2018-12-07 03:39:44 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
5517 2018-12-07 03:39:11 Trump will have to contend with a failing economy and a belligerent Wall Street.  Yesterday stocks fell 700 points. Today the stock market had a bloodbath losing over 6% of its overall value.  Wall Street is extremely wary of Trump's wavering foreign policy maneuvers.
5518 2018-12-07 03:38:57 Stocks in the news: Zydus Wellness, Khadim India, HCL Tech, NHPC, Wipro, Sagar Cements, REC, Coal India
                    Sagar Cements | Coal India | Rural  Electrification Corporation | HCL Tech | Kajaria Ceramics | IFCI and  Punj Lloyd are stocks which are in the news today.
5519 2018-12-07 03:38:24 lmao the stocks I invested in for my project were trash

5526 2018-12-07 03:34:52 Working hard increasing the deficit at the highest pace on record. Working hard to achieve the highest trade deficit with China ever. Working hard at lying on Twitter. Working hard at not providing middle class tax cut as promised. Working hard at not banning Bump stocks, etc!!!!

5545 2018-12-07 03:26:19 That’s some solid inside info!! We have a whole 25 days left in 2018.  Saying they are all down big time from their highs. Seems like your analyst buddy can really forecast where stocks are going! 
5546 2018-12-07 03:25:11 I am now ready to take your questions regarding stocks, just tweet me the complete name of  the company.  No direct messages, please! #thinkervenu

5548 2018-12-07 03:22:37 I have no idea how to sell or trade my stocks
5549 2018-12-07 03:22:33 #titan at 905 is starting its down leg with RSI topping out and MACD given negative crossover and other consumption stocks also seeing pressure. This will fall to 847. #Grivaa #consumption #markets #nifty
5550 2018-12-07 03:22:16 I agree. Fox already started feeding them that stocks are tanking because dems took the house.
5551 2018-12-07 03:21:54 Last pray is that stocks go really south and whales put crypto up to sell a safe heaven idea. Otherwise we will enter global recession with bear market on crypto. And has proven to harm the market, seen by this week drop on futures/btc
5552 2018-12-07 03:21:07 I think she's talking Tesla stocks. Dow Jones just dropped 785 points.

Coal India looks to be a value contrarian pick @ around this level. A dividend yield of close to 7% makes it a good choice for ppl seeking tax free recurring income.
Disclaimer- we hv this in our P.
5557 2018-12-07 03:18:15 #pidilte at 1135 will fall to 1078 levels as stock has topped out after moving from 900 to 1180 . The other stocks esp crude related are also exhaustion showing.
5558 2018-12-07 03:17:17 Just talked to a sell side analyst friend of mine who told me video game stocks may be one of the biggest disappointments of 2018
$EA $TTWO $ATVI all down big in 2018 even though fundies are strong. He said only way out is consolidation, the CEOs of these
5559 2018-12-07 03:16:46 I talk to many traders who have been at this game for decades. They trade human psychology not just stocks. While block-chain technology will change the future, the previous acceleration of the price of bitcoin is driven by the fear of missing out and the greed of current bitcoin

5564 2018-12-07 03:15:23 #Stocks,#Indexes We earlier mentioned how the weak bottom signal could extend into a significant signal. That was before we compared that signal with recent prior weak signals that did so extend, and discovered none were as weak as the current one.
5565 2018-12-07 03:15:22 Mr President: speaking of “fake news,” is it “fake news” that you are pushing for confiscation of guns without due process?
Also, is it “fake news” that you are pushing for the ban and confiscation of bump stocks?

U.S. equities closed up from the lows of the day after a late rally in large technology stocks helped to propel the Nasdaq 100 higher in what was the biggest reversal for the index since April.
5574 2018-12-07 03:10:16 The stock market - for years - has been wildly out of sync with the visible economy; stocks have soared - while the visible economy increasingly looks like a poor Caribbean tourist island where the locals can't afford what they sell.
Is it hard to see that stocks are gambling?

5582 2018-12-07 03:04:55 Here's how I find my target prices:
Review the stocks daily chart for any similar type of breakouts in the past (hopefully in the same direction) and look at how much it moved each time before hitting any chop. Most of the time they are similar amounts/percentages.

5586 2018-12-07 03:03:48 Whilst I mostly agree, a FC average of 41 is good compared to what else is out there.

There’s guys being selected with mid to low 30’s 

There’s only about 4-5 guys who aren’t in the test team that average over 40. Our stocks are thin.
5587 2018-12-07 03:02:39 High divi stocks on 2% plus down days. Portfolio builds itself. Divi gets cut so does position. Unique approach to a possible bear market.
5588 2018-12-07 03:01:47 it was reasonable to expect the market to rebalance and prices to recover from the $30s and $40s with a 1.8 mil b/d cut. It delivered the goods, in terms of mopping up the surplus in OECD stocks as well as shoring up crude prices.
5589 2018-12-07 03:01:31 It would appear as though Trump is really enjoying gun control too. Let’s see...confiscation prior to due process, ERPO laws. Also ban and confiscation of bump stocks. I’d say that falls in the gun control category!
5590 2018-12-07 03:00:47 Not all of a sudden. Don’t be a sacred to walk the streets. I’m sure criminals are not carrying illegal guns. The President is not correct on ignoring due process. Banning bump stocks. People with fingers can do the same thing. Worried about people’s ignorance about freedom.
5591 2018-12-07 03:00:02 I was kind of want to get the system tray to close family to sell their stocks before is STRONGLY ethical
5592 2018-12-07 02:59:32 Always expensive in relation with nifty. If market goes down , valuation stocks will also go down. Earnings one will only recover ?
5593 2018-12-07 02:59:27 For 4 stocks in this list.....

Hungry kid index needed to compare to DOW?
5601 2018-12-07 02:53:23 What instrument are you interested in trading? Crypto? Stocks? Forex? Futures? Options
5602 2018-12-07 02:53:21 People in crypto were willfully ignorant.  That's ego. #egokills. However I see many clear signs of their pivoting, much faster than traditional firms.  As a perennial failure* I still think capitulation is closer in #crypto than #stocks

*Good traders fail all the time.
5603 2018-12-07 02:53:00 Watchlist 12/7 Night:
$ASNS nice closing, watch over $4.25
$TNXP spiking AHs, watch over $4.
$PTX $UXIN what a pump and dump today! Always be careful with these kinds of stocks because one mistake can lead into a big loss.
$AETI $NVLN downtrend lines, but watch for short squeeze.
5604 2018-12-07 02:52:39 Tataas kasi ang presyo ng mga produkto diyan kung ang wages ng mga factory workers ay mataas kaysa sa Mexico at Tsina. Maging ang imported steel na mas mura. Babagsak namang ang profitability ng mga kumpanya at tutumal ang bentahan ng stocks nito.
5605 2018-12-07 02:52:22 They laughed at Reagan. Experts on TV said the stocks and GM & Ford were going to crash and burn, blah blah, 3 years later the market took off like nothing I have ever seen!
5606 2018-12-07 02:52:02 There is a community that has been thriving on luck by selling "hope". They are called #StockMarketExperts or #InvestmentAdvisers
They have bloody no knowledge (bcoz no one can know!) of how stocks behave! #FridayFeeling
5607 2018-12-07 02:51:59 If you think this scenario is likely then it would be crazy to hold pot stocks through this crash. Where do you see $HMMJ $MJ if $SPX gets to 2300?
5608 2018-12-07 02:51:45 Call out the record corporate profit, record low rates that fueled record high stock buybacks that sent stocks record high. Call out record high CEO pay. Call out the capitalists. Don't be a crony.

All the major stocks are crashing
Not because of Asad umar or #IK 
But because of CHINA and USA trade war.
5612 2018-12-07 02:47:21 yep $TLT resisting 200sma on daily again, extended from 10sma and that 118  has been tough on some stocks to cross too.

5614 2018-12-07 02:46:17 Don’t you think stocks can fall out of favor without a recession?
5615 2018-12-07 02:44:32 as i said earlier.  the best set up for tomorrow is a weaker headline NFP with a strong AHE number.   
Sell Stocks, sell JPY crosses , sell AUD and NZD, BUY USD/ EM .  If that isnt the result, I'll be done for the day at 8am.....
5616 2018-12-07 02:44:19 Money, stocks which haven't vested yet, and for immigrants, well immigration. Anyone on H1B at these companies won't dare speak out against it, unless they are a star on their own.

5621 2018-12-07 02:41:43 Reaching almost 4.0 GDP  Stocks fluctuate. Nothing one can do.
5622 2018-12-07 02:41:17 Is this why stocks turned around 500 points today?
5623 2018-12-07 02:40:27 Kool we lost 1200 pts ..I have no stocks idgaf about stocks , everyone else does
5624 2018-12-07 02:39:43 Good morning, 

Dow rebounds from 780-point plunge, ends day just slightly lower on report Fed may pause hikes

Stocks closed well off their session lows on Thursday after news broke that the Federal Reserve could tighten monetary policy at a slower pace than previously expected.

5626 2018-12-07 02:38:40 One of the biggest challenges: the financial media's talking heads are generally inexperienced "salespeople" profiting from the sale of Stocks, Bonds,& Property. Most do not understand valuation & parrot "It's different this time" It's NEVER different. Keep Up The Excellent Work!
5627 2018-12-07 02:38:28 Trump supporters have no problem with stocks.  Another prove that we are smarter. I am sure, your idols feel for you, dave.
5628 2018-12-07 02:37:40 With private estimates having the Brazilian crop as high as 130 million MTs, do we still have structural competition problems from massive soybean carryover stocks even if China removes its US import tariffs?
5629 2018-12-07 02:36:32 I want to start dabbling in stocks/investing but I don't even know where to start 
5630 2018-12-07 02:36:21 Don’t worry. I haven’t checked my IRA in years, and I don’t plan on it, especially since we moved it all from a slow-growing fund to a faster growing stocks fund.
5631 2018-12-07 02:35:12 The Church can give as many opinions as they want, but in the end, it's the Legislative members who vote and make decisions, and THEY are in the pockets of the UMA and Pharmaceutical cos.  The Church DOES not MAKE LAW, even if they own stocks in big Pharma
5632 2018-12-07 02:34:40 $spy $spx Still no man's land. However, keep in mind no matter how the reversals look - just because a recession may not happen tomorrow doesn't mean market should go up. Stocks remain hyper extended. Be prepared to change direction. $amzn $aapl $goog $nflx $tsla $fb $nvda
5633 2018-12-07 02:34:36 I try to trade like a robot, keep emotion out of the trade but when my stocks go down I still blow a fuse.

U.S.  equities closed up from the lows of the day after a late rally in large  technology stocks helped to propel the Nasdaq 100 higher in what was  the biggest reversal for the index since April.

5643 2018-12-07 02:28:54 Asian stocks posted modest gains in early trade following an afternoon rally in the U.S. that erased most of the day’s losses, as investors grappled with shifting indications on U.S.-China trade talks and prospects for a pause in Federal Reserve tightening.

5649 2018-12-07 02:25:11 All of this is very confusing, so I'm just watching #WillAndGrace while checking my stocks and having no idea what you and @SethAMandel are disagreeing about.
5650 2018-12-07 02:24:51 In this stocks situation it might take a long run
5651 2018-12-07 02:24:28 You were right. GM SHOULD HAVE GONE TO CHAPTER 11. This company is a black hole. HOW MUCH WAS THE BAILOUT? Al least the State should had receive STOCKS and control the company.

5655 2018-12-07 02:22:53 Stocks at a loss for the year. Deficit expanded. Trade imbalances increasing. Companies closing factories and moving overseas. That’s the economic side. On the personal side, he’s an ignorant, racist, misogynistic asshole. So why should people vote for him again, Ms. Romney?
5656 2018-12-07 02:21:22 A3 the best way to find out how to invest on social media is to research the different companies and what’s doing really good. I would invest in stocks or triple a something like that. #TXSocialMedia
5657 2018-12-07 02:19:19 Idk if y’all care but stocks are dropping. Which is the best time to buy while others are scared and selling. Just remember if its down it must go back up one day.
5658 2018-12-07 02:19:00 My stocks did go up for 10 years.  It crashed this past year
5659 2018-12-07 02:15:02 This is an unnecessarily extreme view. We can all create financial assets endogenously. By your logic stocks and bonds issued by corporations are also "fraud". Deposits are just assets created when new loans are made when two parties agree to a contractual obligation. Not fraud.

5664 2018-12-07 02:12:55 We were able to keep our jobs.  We purchased a home in 2008 after the market had declined some.  With a fixed rate FHA mortgage and the homebuyer credit.  

Kept buying stocks.

Felt it most in 2011 as it started to strangle the construction industry in Texas.
5665 2018-12-07 02:12:54 ASF is a big concern and has long-lasting impact, limiting soymeal in feed formulation not has much impact as ASF, but carry-out stocks are expected to move high.

5674 2018-12-07 02:03:44 @mikel15111 can’t believe you actually own $snap stocks, so of your tweets are so negative, I thought you’re a short lol
5675 2018-12-07 02:03:08 Yeah, but people who own companies own stocks and bonds, so the crash immediately caused business owners to cut back, which lead to mass layoffs, and the downward spiral went from there.  Just make sure you have 12 months cash in the bank and you'll be fine...
5676 2018-12-07 02:02:54 Percentage wise, it looks like one of those penny stocks pump and dump!
5677 2018-12-07 02:01:33 #Stocks,#Indexes Pretty damned hard to predict what's coming next. But least likely is continuation of the rally.
5678 2018-12-07 02:01:04 Weed stocks.
5679 2018-12-07 02:00:52 I generally agree with the sentiment. However, companies don't invest money in stocks generally. They buy back their stock, but the stock they buy back then ceases to exist. They sell stock, but whether the price of the stock goes down after they sell it does not affect them.

5681 2018-12-07 02:00:16 Expect the whole Russian intelligence apparatus to leak Trump dirt until election. Trump has become the new voice of American neocons looking to raise arms and military stocks. Trump was compromised from the moment Cohen was raided.

5684 2018-12-07 01:59:21 #Stocks,#Indexes Bottom signals of today are as weak as they come, just above subliminal. Recent signals of this strength were followed by resumption of selloff.  Resumption of the rallying is unlikely. The weakly founded rally is inconsistent with a final top signal.

5721 2018-12-07 01:35:18 Simple explanation- it’s “The Cooperman Rally” Lee Cooperman was interviewed on CNBC right as markets were plummeting. Lee shared his insights into the attractiveness of stocks and said markets would rally by year end and close higher.

5723 2018-12-07 01:33:26 I'm really excited for Ultimate, but I do not understand the crazy knockback that I'm seeing for a lot of moves. I swear people die at like 80% when being hit. Why not make it 4 stocks? Oh well, we can always change things if we wanted to.
5724 2018-12-07 01:32:25 Why so angry?  All the winning?  Stocks down, deficit up, trade imbalance at 20 year high, National debt skyrocketing, midterms, still losing in Afghanistan and cabinet member after member pleading guilty or resigning. It’s ok sunshine 2020 around the corner.
5725 2018-12-07 01:30:34 Btc has similar qualities to gold,so maybe considered a cash asset and although more volatile than gold,it may get demand from buyers in countries with currencies that weaken during recessions?
Utility tokens may be like high risk tech stocks which get less demand in recessions?
5726 2018-12-07 01:29:43 Me (a passive investor): What are stocks?
5727 2018-12-07 01:29:15 Stocks app for iPhone, cropped
5728 2018-12-07 01:28:55 No money to make in penny stocks? $NHPI - Price in August - .0001
               Price in December - .0192

Do the math.
5729 2018-12-07 01:28:39 Hardly a done deal. Nasdaq lists hundreds of stocks, many of which go down, Nothing listed trades for more than $2500 I believe.
5730 2018-12-07 01:27:39 It is so hard to choose:  Better Investing Magazine, Make Me Smart Podcast, Marketplace Podcast, Motley Fool Answers Podcast, Her Money Podcast, ValueLine Magazine, Edgar Database and more are great for financial education (stocks).  #VSAHKG #1FunKai #TryPod
5731 2018-12-07 01:26:30 As always people should make sure they’re allocated correctly stocks/bonds based on their retirement date. The Dow is still up 5000 points from Trump’s inauguration date!
5732 2018-12-07 01:25:36 I got bonds not stocks bitch that’s how you save
5733 2018-12-07 01:25:33 @Lel0uche_Vi_Brittania @vergun Ya we'll see. I'm positioned short in stocks that've been in downtrends for 3+ months... i like my odds
5734 2018-12-07 01:24:17 yep it goes slower when stocks are being smashed like WHK this morning. I use Spark for trading and Commsec viewpoint for TA
5735 2018-12-07 01:22:44 there are other stocks setting up as potential leaders as well, getting close to breaking out of their Darvas Boxes soon. #watching #waiting
5736 2018-12-07 01:22:23 Glad I dumped all my stocks at the top lmao. Cash is king for now. See y'all at the bottom. I have my eye on Apple sub $130.
5737 2018-12-07 01:21:50 By the time I figure out what you privileged folk are talking about I will be in my coffin . Nearly two-thirds of Americans (64 percent) admit they have gambled in the last year. just 54% of Americans invest in the market, either through individual stocks, mutual funds, pension
5738 2018-12-07 01:20:50 I’m watching my stocks tank because of you!!!!
5739 2018-12-07 01:20:05 Not too bad - I was pretty conservative (stocks) before that only down abt 3% - RE has very good appreciation and solid  cash flow
5740 2018-12-07 01:18:59 ATF prices may be cut further in Jan if crude prices remain at this level. It will give boost to spicejet and indigo.  One should buy if they can handel the wild swings in airline stocks. It is again time to watch and enter market after Dec12th
5741 2018-12-07 01:17:34 And their stocks are taking a shit.
5742 2018-12-07 01:17:27 Trump is bad for stocks

5744 2018-12-07 01:16:46 I only invest my stocks in the finest companies: Trump Casinos, Trump Steaks, Trump Vodka, Bitcoin, Nigerian 419 scammers, Q memorabilia, and so on
5745 2018-12-07 01:16:39 CHEAP VANADIUM STOCKS 
5746 2018-12-07 01:16:02 I'm going to puke if someone keeps mentioning cheap vanadium stocks...
5747 2018-12-07 01:15:34 Be nice if you could just transfer your stocks to another exchange like we transfer crypto.
5748 2018-12-07 01:14:14 SHUT UP...stocks have dumped because of your lies! Because you tweeted I'm The Tariff Man! You are an idiot of the largest degree! NOBODY believes a word you say! RESIGN! NOW!!
5749 2018-12-07 01:14:08 You #NeverTrumpers just don't get it! He wants to make stocks cheaper so Real Americans (TM) can buy them instead of just globalist elite liberals. It's all part of the plan #maga #WWG1WGA
5750 2018-12-07 01:14:03 @Reasoning bro honesty I deal with people like you online. The main focus is helping each other with the stocks not finding issue

5752 2018-12-07 01:11:47 Where did the idea of a recession come in? Understood that the markets have been bi-polar (we’re over the top! We are in the gutter!), but more causes a recession than stocks, all other signs are doing well.

5756 2018-12-07 01:09:19 Are you sure ? Don't lie again . I can't keep buying stocks based on your lies.
5757 2018-12-07 01:07:27 Wealthy are sleeping tight!  Thanks to GOP the top 10% are giddy with kickback cash and ready to buy our 401Ks, stocks and real estate at bargain basement prices.

5760 2018-12-07 01:06:10 Rates already very low and I doubt whether it will make any difference to the bubble bursting. Who’s going to buy in a rapidly declining market and now lenders are imposing stricter standards. What happens to interests rates if US and Australian stocks collapse?
5761 2018-12-07 01:05:26 Kansas City's food businesses stocks all just went up

5764 2018-12-07 01:03:38 @firstmetrosec How do I transfers my stocks from COL financial to FMS?
5765 2018-12-07 01:03:13 I hope so too. Im thinking baka it’s the easiest stuff to ship, since they posted it late na rin. Or they ran out of stocks after the previous tours. At least there’s a month before SG. But then Nagoya comes before. If nagoya has, then SG doesn’t, then... 
5766 2018-12-07 01:02:59 Yeah you managed to hold the Presidency too!  And NOONE is talking about it! 

'Oh.. They lost the house, they lost tons of red state seats, his disapproval rating is sky high, the economy is crashing, stocks are down, he looks stupid at G20, he's going to jail, he looks crazy.'
5767 2018-12-07 01:02:34 I’m a master at that.  Just short any stocks that gap up
5768 2018-12-07 01:02:15 Para mí que Donald manda a comprar stocks, tuitea, manda a vender, etcétera.

5773 2018-12-07 00:59:17 That is a really good news, boss for tomorrow. I wish this tweet had came up earlier to help the stocks market.

5776 2018-12-07 00:57:35 Estudar 4 cadeiras ao mesmo tempo tem os seus quês, tipo... um sistema de custeio total com uma variância pouco percentual da taxa de juro efectiva não irá provocar alterações na gestão de stocks kk
5777 2018-12-07 00:55:42 I can't remember who once told me that stocks go up by the escalator but come down by the lift, but it's a pretty apt descriptor of sharemarket behaviour.  

I do however remember my old boss at Mercer loved using "don't try to catch a falling knife" in markets like this. 
5778 2018-12-07 00:54:27 Binili ko na ang lahat ng stocks mumsh hahahaha

5782 2018-12-07 00:51:47 idk why I'm a finance major I hate stocks and the stock market
5783 2018-12-07 00:51:22 What if I told you the sec & cftc will actually REQUIRE all stocks, derivitives and swaps to be tokenized to blockchains because thats the only way they can regulate properly. Companies will have to explain if their math doesnt add up in the conversion, then its all public ledger
5784 2018-12-07 00:50:59 Stocks will ho up tomorrow.
5785 2018-12-07 00:50:51 Is it possible that we can institute at least part of the markets requiring stocks to be traded within tight parameters in actual relation to the company the stock represents?  Tired of all the volatility based on people’s opinions
5786 2018-12-07 00:50:18 Have you looked at the stocks lately?
5787 2018-12-07 00:49:20 And when I said 2 stocks to my 5 so that’s the end 
5788 2018-12-07 00:49:13 Well done sir. Now get stocks back on track. #MAGA
5789 2018-12-07 00:48:40 Stock-Market fell because institution buyers pulled out from tech stocks-and the fall of oil prices caused fall in prices of energy stocks-"Trump spoke so markets crashed"is a ridiculous talking point only fools would believe.Institutions not retail investors triggered the fall.
5790 2018-12-07 00:48:12 Just narrative... I'm willing to bet that a horde of average joes get destroyed by weed-stocks just like in the 2017 crypto-bubble. Does this mean weed industry will fail? Doubtful. As for fundamentals... on a base level I don't think they're any strong now than they've ever been
5791 2018-12-07 00:48:06 What are the stocks?  Thanks
5792 2018-12-07 00:47:47 He is paying to much money to be this hands on this league has no public stocks!
5793 2018-12-07 00:47:32 IMO no Fed rate hikes after Dec 2018 , big positive for gold and silver metals and mining stocks, needs a bit of patience though now
5794 2018-12-07 00:47:15 Going through some charts and beyond impressed by the strength in many software and medical stocks today. Many of these names want to explode higher once the pressure of the market is relieved.

5796 2018-12-07 00:45:29 If they was good. Then I'll start to watch Raw and Smackdown again, and not just the ppv. Why do I still watch WWE ppv. Because I own stocks. Can't get the corporate tax until after a year of holding a stock.
5797 2018-12-07 00:45:20 Congrats.......lIm sorry I just don’t mess with penny stocks. Good Luck!!
5798 2018-12-07 00:44:06 Honestly, I don't know what the answer is. Maybe outlaw high capacity clips and bump stocks. As a supporter of 2A and a Democrat I get tired of hearing the same drool from a lobbyist organization.
5799 2018-12-07 00:43:55 “I think most investors are over-exposed to the banks - you want to have bank stocks be 10-15% of your portfolio” 

Good luck with that, mate....
5800 2018-12-07 00:43:09 Following a rare midweek U.S. trading holiday, stocks tumbled at the outset of the trading, with the benchmark S&P 500 dropping as much as 2.9 percent.
5801 2018-12-07 00:42:03 While energy stocks responded to a sharp fall in the crude price as @Occidental sank 3.1%, @ExxonMobil dropped 1.3%, @Chevron fell 1.1% and @ConocoPhillips eased 0.5%.
5802 2018-12-07 00:40:25 So true! I've found learning in crypto (and your group) has helped me trading with stocks tho.  Market closing gives you a breather and time for more analysis.  Crypto...non-stop activity is tough for us newbies and great for the experienced!  Glad it's not going anywhere!

5811 2018-12-07 00:36:39 Energy stocks are cheap and the S&P Bullish Percent Index has lifted to over 17% after falling below the 5% table pounding buy threshold which we sent out to Black Gold subscribers.
5812 2018-12-07 00:36:09 Wider stops won't help. It's better to avoid entering stocks that are in a macro side trend. Like MSFT was stuck at 25 for years. So it helps to look at the longer term chart first to make sure you are in a macro healthy uptrend.
5813 2018-12-07 00:34:30 I can't believe $TLRY is still at $100 while all pot stocks are bleeding... what a fucking joke. In January when the shares unlock it would be a perfect short timing

5815 2018-12-07 00:33:22 How about they mention the tanking stocks, stagnate wages, skyrocketing deficit, and a never ending trade war with China? Oh, and your blind support of Saudi Arabia.
5816 2018-12-07 00:33:17 Stocks go up, stocks go down. As a long-term investor, this market turbulence is just noise and should not bother you in the slightest. Remember, when stocks go down, it means you can buy more shares at lower prices. Stay in the game.
5817 2018-12-07 00:32:25 Stop buying chinese stocks then. actually manage your fund. I bet you don't even know what your 401k is invested in. Smh.

“Oh auto factories firing thousands?”

“Oh debt soaring?”

5828 2018-12-07 00:29:24 I’m staying away from shorting the bank stocks. I think I heard from someone dear that I shouldn’t so I didn’t. But it looks like Deutsche Bank is in deep doo doo.
5829 2018-12-07 00:29:17 I’d like to see a tokenized index of a variety is assets; various metals, currencies, commodities, land, real estate, SP500 stocks, emerging market indexes.  All in one massive tokenized basket.
5830 2018-12-07 00:28:39 I hear you. On other hand, penny stocks are also made available to purchase in market. Lottery tickets have no better return or investment safe haven. My main point is, the market won’t grow, if they don’t allow it to grow and mature. 
5831 2018-12-07 00:28:27 As for oil, your window to short is now to about March.  Oil is seasonally strong in APR/MAY as refiners demand crude to make fuel for the summer driving months.  Oil stocks still may go down in APR/MAY but you are swimming upstream.
5832 2018-12-07 00:27:16 @Steve_Moore $SPY Most traders keep underestimating the power of going long on stocks, even though we've shown it can be quite profitable.

5846 2018-12-07 00:15:55 Evil people always exist, but an evil person with a gun is much more dangerous.

5847 2018-12-07 00:14:56 Depends on definition of active. Here, I was referring to certain low cost index fund companies offering “total stock market index funds” that are actually invested solely in US large cap stocks. Not diversified. I also believe in strategies that can beat indexing over time.
