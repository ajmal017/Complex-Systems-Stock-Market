7 2018-12-26 23:54:51 Agreed but it's also true that rich countries are more able to innovate and adapt. W Africa can't support its current population, much less 3 or 4 times as many people. Especially as the desert is growing every year, rainfall is decreasing and Europe is decimating the fish stocks

9 2018-12-26 23:54:44 I have seen them make a few tickers untradable during midday and the reason was that they are to volatile. One was an ETF, look at the spy that thing is/has been crazy lately. Are they gonna ban trading the spy and FAANG stocks
10 2018-12-26 23:54:29 Stocks always rise and fall..it blows my mind how many idiot actually want to see it do bad just to blame Trump
11 2018-12-26 23:53:56 Brokers say drops are an “opportunity to buy stocks at sale prices”. If you look at sectors with traditionally rapid recovery, or individual companies with strong financials, this can be true. But the index can take years to recover as some companies get revalued or don’t make it

13 2018-12-26 23:53:39 Agreed, but shorts needed to get their head blown off once to realize there is a level where most or all of the bad news priced in.  So far looks like that might be 2,300 on SPX, which equates to about 13x- appropriate for slow/no growth EPS environment.  #Stocks #StockMarket

15 2018-12-26 23:53:31 I simply published Monday that stocks were oversold and due for bounce. I was though 50 points shy of my S&P 500 to 3000 call for 2018 but not fundamentally bullish headed into 2019 shy fresh QE/buybacks. The liquidity drought is alive so my thesis stands. You may resume bashing.
16 2018-12-26 23:53:17 What now? Will money still flow from stocks to cryptos? Aye crypto investors just screwed?

Oh, yeah, I forgot; any good news that could possibly reflect on Trump's Presidency doesn't fit your narrative.

43 2018-12-26 23:47:55 Definitely start to look at books on basic index investing and the get wealthy slow techniques in the books if you want to hold on to stocks. There are very good books on vanguard index funds
44 2018-12-26 23:47:52 Ha ha
You should be put in the stocks!
Anyway your lot need to start losing
45 2018-12-26 23:47:50 Sería una economía guiada por la demanda, las "empresas" enviarían la información sobre la evolución de los stocks en el caso de los bienes a los centros de planificación para que el plan inicial se ajuste en todo momento.
46 2018-12-26 23:47:37 How safe are these investments when the banks randomly choose wealth asset owners to be "crime targets" while the stocks are "recycled" in merger & acquisitions in the "democratic" system of "government estate duties". This is Africa (TIA) in the name of "democracy"!

52 2018-12-26 23:44:55 Good time to enter or re-enter some Gold stocks today with this pull back, that is if you're a believer that we are heading into disinflation, dollar devaluing, lower interest rates and a slow down in world growth.
53 2018-12-26 23:43:59 You really have no clue how the stock market works do you? But really. Why do you care? You actually own stock?

The market wasnt going up under him in any sustainable way. It was nothing more than corporate buy backs of their own stocks.

False inflation of the market.

55 2018-12-26 23:43:29 1. people on benefits tend to spend all of their money so any benefits paid continue to stay in the economy.

2. QE raised the value of stocks and bonds by an estimated 26% (£600bn). The richest 10% of the UK saw their assets rise by £322k (pensions and wealth portfolios)

68 2018-12-26 23:40:14 When stocks were getting slammed, bears said how bad that was. When stocks ripped 5% higher today, bears are saying that’s bad too.
69 2018-12-26 23:39:48 Mostly that, it's an excuse for stores to sell their surplus stocks.
It's kinda like Black Friday, but in reverse and everybody is super polite.
It's also a good occasion to buy the things you would have wanted but didn't want to ask.

71 2018-12-26 23:39:07 Stocks are a social construct
72 2018-12-26 23:38:56 Sorry, Mr. Trump. One visit to the troops does not erase the chaos you have unleashed, both domestically and around the world. Same goes for a one-day jump in stocks. I’m sure you’ll claim all the credit, though—and take none of the blame when things go south.
73 2018-12-26 23:38:42 Sheldon probably got

(which is ILLEGAL for you and me) & probably owns Insurance co. stocks...

75 2018-12-26 23:38:23 De tanto estar de compras en tiendas de ropa, @petrogustavo confunde acciones con inventarios. (Stocks).

Se le abona que no las confundió con "medias" (socks).
76 2018-12-26 23:38:14 DOW up +1000 points and many stocks gaping up. Still not sure where overall market will move in coming weeks/months and so better to be very selective and only put minimal capital in the market.
Hence only one for me today. Knowing business model, chart and price range
77 2018-12-26 23:38:13 Do you think he was doing it to manipulate the market and gave advance warning to Oligarchs who protect him? That would be a crime, no? He did tweet about it being a good time to buy stocks....
78 2018-12-26 23:37:59 roys stupid good but all he has over chrom is sideb unfortunately

but hey sideb at ledge takes stocks mad early
79 2018-12-26 23:37:35 Gusfajo, por favor no cambies, ya de indignarnos con vuestra mala voluntad y capacidad de manejar ingenuos has pasado a divertirnos con total ignorancia y ridiculez. Stocks = inventarios. 
80 2018-12-26 23:37:30 Eighteen stocks on the watchlist. All positive. Seven had above average volume and nothing above 100%. Most were 20% or less above average daily volume.
81 2018-12-26 23:37:26 Ptdrrrrrr oh merde g pas fait exprès jvoulais faire une blague tape tes meilleures esquives stp quand tu seras la bas g vla les stocks de thé a ecouler avant de clamser
82 2018-12-26 23:37:13 Can you correct your BS false accusation please. Where is Trump right now?  What did stocks do today?
83 2018-12-26 23:37:06 7.) use the S&P 500 as your market baseline as to how the market is doing at that moment.
8.) learn about stochastics
9.) make sure you have at least 2 monitors for charts during the trading day
10.) make a short list of stocks to watch each week.
84 2018-12-26 23:36:36 Outlook for today 27.12.18 markets will be trade in green. #FIIs were buyers. #dow #nasdaq up approx 5% each. #crude up 8%. Beaten down stocks might correct.  #Trump shutdown update he is willing to wait  & whatever it takes. Monthly expiry today. Bears in a fix 
85 2018-12-26 23:36:14 2 stocks, no time limit. Fight me!

87 2018-12-26 23:36:02 No entendes @rosebor1976. SI le alcanza, porque habrá ahorrado sabiendo q esto podia pasar. Se llama postergar el gasto de hoy pensando en el futuro, algo novedoso después de tantos años de consumir los stocks de un país. Lo q dice es q debería alcanzarle al q siempre aporto. Mal
88 2018-12-26 23:35:42 #madtweets what do you think of hemp and marijuana stocks?
89 2018-12-26 23:34:59 U.S stocks markets swoon 
90 2018-12-26 23:34:37 This is why all my retirement isn’t in stocks and also why it’s a long term play not a year to year play no matter how much the news plays politics and sensationalizes every bit of movement.
91 2018-12-26 23:34:30 So.... are you familiar with stocks? I have a question.
92 2018-12-26 23:34:06 Don't we just leave it in the bowl until it goes bad and then pelt the peasants in the stocks with it?
93 2018-12-26 23:34:01 The stocks are sticking it to the Feds!
94 2018-12-26 23:33:54 Like a limit on what you can short and what you can't. Using simple stocks model...Hard to borrow others that are cheaper. It's easy to blowup shorting a .01 coin....IE structured what is available to short.
95 2018-12-26 23:33:49 Yup and all the rich dudes bought stocks low over last few days and now can sell high. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that Trumps behavior sunk the market and then today’s behavior rallied it. The guy is a complete con man.
96 2018-12-26 23:33:45 @Madtweets how do you feel about the hemp and marijuana stocks?
97 2018-12-26 23:33:20 No sorry. Why if i start an idea like apple phones or facebook and devolped over time. Should i go on to share it with people that didnt invest in me in the first place! Didnt support me through the tears and pains! Anyway they can share in the if they buy the stocks and shares
98 2018-12-26 23:33:06 Rishi picks me up after not seeing him in months. 
I get in the car to go to dap him up and with his phone in his hand he says “dude give me a second I’m trying to trade some stocks.” 
Good to know it’s still the same Rishi.
99 2018-12-26 23:33:04 Its not a real match unless your slapping stocks below 70%
100 2018-12-26 23:33:00 A lot of these are good but they need to really drive the point home about people owning individual stocks. I’m wondering how much people lost over margin calls and triggered stop orders in the last few weeks. You feel pain with etfs and mural funds but not like with stocks.
101 2018-12-26 23:32:48 Stocks dropping ...crypto rising
102 2018-12-26 23:32:38 Actually stocks were worse since Great Depression, farmers are losing their lands, people from your administration & campaign are going to jail plus quitting, Mueller, and the world views you as #WorsePresidentEver! RT this if you think Trump should resign before #impeached!
103 2018-12-26 23:32:37 Hahahahahaha Han ity doesn't know how stocks work. Lol
104 2018-12-26 23:32:11 Pretty nice. Just push A in any direction and there's his kit. Make sure to fill up your Chrom Meter by eating glue between stocks!
105 2018-12-26 23:32:07 I went to our state library last week and all the books I was interested in were dispersed amongst the community libraries, there was not one in stocks in the central state library.
Not sure what that says but there you have it.
106 2018-12-26 23:31:31 ¿Señores @OpenEnglish, tienen un programa de “Business English” para Petro? El señor cree que en ese contexto “stocks” son inventarios. Gracias.

108 2018-12-26 23:30:47 These unprecedented, eye popping big moves in stocks just show the financial mkts are broken with the growth of robots and algos. We are not in Kansas anymore. $DJIA $VIX
109 2018-12-26 23:30:28 You do stocks?
110 2018-12-26 23:29:49 Trump economy when stocks go up, Fed fault when stocks go down.  Hypocrite much?
111 2018-12-26 23:28:20 @RealJamesWoods how’d ur stocks end up doing?
112 2018-12-26 23:28:17 Stocks market falling is:
113 2018-12-26 23:27:58 To me it doesn’t matter if they have stocks. I tip them xrp on twitter then show them how I can use that value to convert to fiat and pay on a debit card(wirex/PayPal) in seconds. They get the point....

115 2018-12-26 23:26:46 the strength in the software stocks during this downtrend is obvious. these will be market leaders if this mkt finds its footing
116 2018-12-26 23:26:39 Also, remember that private businesses (with equivalent equity risk profiles) have intrinsic value fluctuations of 50-75% in a given year, just like individual public stocks.
117 2018-12-26 23:26:16 Trump leaves the country for a few hours and stocks surge.
Coincidence, no
118 2018-12-26 23:25:55 All 30 stocks in the Dow Industrial  notched gains as did each of the 11 sectors in the broader S&P

122 2018-12-26 23:25:27 Makes sense. I don't see a reason why oil wouldn't be big in the future.
I'm long on Danske Bank. I spent all the money I got at my confirmation on stocks (it was back in 2008 and they were low at the time).
123 2018-12-26 23:25:20 Amigo defienda a Petro está en su derecho. Pero justificar el hecho de que no sepa lo que significa "stocks" en lenguaje bursatil  y los confunda con "inventarios" siendo un supuesto economista en serio ya es ceguera intelectual, feliz día.
124 2018-12-26 23:25:18 omg they're running out of stocks already kakckakcks and i won't be able to get mine until this evening T_____T
125 2018-12-26 23:25:09 Usted no se cansa de hacer el ridiculo ? Inducir al error a los borregos que lo siguen ? No discernir entre qué significa stocks e inventarios ? Cómo se maneja la Bolsa ? Cómo, cómo pretende o aspira ser presidente de Colombia ? Sus “inocentadas” espero despierten a muchos
126 2018-12-26 23:24:35 The current recognitions would be around it being more numbers necessary to have placings on stocks I did a 27 digit access 27 digit written look name representing name ten and hundred
127 2018-12-26 23:23:51 Y para acabar de ajustar demuestra su ignorancia con el inglés

El señor se refiere a stocks... Acciones

128 2018-12-26 23:23:37 You guys know he banned bump stocks right?
129 2018-12-26 23:23:22 Who made this ignorant immigration policy, Obama! Montel is a ignorant man, if we had immigration laws this wouldn't have happened. The stocks are up 1,086. He is a fool.
130 2018-12-26 23:22:57 Market panic and traders know stocks are oversold for a short period
131 2018-12-26 23:22:36 No thanks! Gave me $650 over 2 years ago for my iPhone 6 but trade in on my 7 plus is $300? Ya you haven’t updated shit on your phone near enough to switch at that price. No wonder your stocks are dropping
132 2018-12-26 23:22:26 I did a little. You don't have to be rich to make money in stocks. Just do it on a smaller level.
133 2018-12-26 23:22:06 Notice it was when the DemoRATS got elected into the House the stocks started falling, the fed makes it worse, the dress start talking raising taxes, replacing regulations Trump got rid of to open the economy and the markets.
Then they will try to blame Trump for killing the good
134 2018-12-26 23:22:03 He went to get the news of his "home alone" whining. Shutdown, stocks, everyone that suddenly became pro war and worrying about the Kurds.
135 2018-12-26 23:22:00 It's difficult to pass all the rise in feed prices to the shipment price of pork, and livestock farmers seem to be getting stricter.
Also at the edible oil manufacturing factory raw material stocks're exhausted, seems to be insufficient in necessary quantity.
136 2018-12-26 23:21:19 And unfortunately I don’t own any Dow stocks. What a time to be alive.
137 2018-12-26 23:21:16 Stocks are up again, mister!
138 2018-12-26 23:20:46 We lost 150K of our pension money in stocks...just saying...the system is fixed
139 2018-12-26 23:20:35 Crippling our country? STOCKS ROAR BACK -- DOW +1,086 -- BIGGEST GAIN EVER -- BOOM: Holiday Retail Sales Strongest in Years -- Low gas prices lead to record travel. #MAGA #Trump2020Landslide
140 2018-12-26 23:20:33 Y no solo las singularidades del SPY a partir de las 11 AM se dio el Rally para otros stocks !!!  FB, AAPL, MSFT ... Virtualmente cualquiera hubiera podido verse beneficiado !!!
141 2018-12-26 23:18:58 Have you thought that maybe the “inner circle” shorted the market and then re-purchase stocks after price were down?
142 2018-12-26 23:18:56 I heard from my local radio, and unfortunately it was linked from Fox News, they said the stock market went up. They even said a credit card company's stocks went up a bit. It was like they were saying, "Oh, no! Everything is Good! It's not bad! C'mon! Don't worry!" :/ #tytlive
143 2018-12-26 23:18:41 Didn't it fall a lot further than it recovered or is it something I don't know bout stocks looks like it started falling last week and just came up some today aren't investors still in the hole or what IDK guess  I'd be happy for any gains after the fall
144 2018-12-26 23:18:25 His did after Christmas, because he had so much pressure to do so. One good thing, no tweets for hours! I think that's why the stocks rebounded. If he can just stop tweeting, it would help us all.
145 2018-12-26 23:18:07 If we send Trump to Mars, will stocks be over the moon?
146 2018-12-26 23:18:04 With such vision she should be picking stocks
147 2018-12-26 23:17:38 I just remembered I almost beat my brother with one stock on yoshi versus his 4 stocks on roy after our 5 player free-for-all was down to us and all my cousins were absolutely losing their shit and he won with a crazy counter and we gave each other a look of “what the fuck”
148 2018-12-26 23:17:28 Damn idiots with 2 stocks and non-omega and non-battlefield stages online. Get with the program.
149 2018-12-26 23:17:12 So Chris, you are trying to convince us that if the government was not shut down, stocks not taking a dump and he was at Mar a Largo he was planning to go to Iraq. Nope! He would be sitting around with his millionaire buddies and playing golf.
150 2018-12-26 23:17:11 You supposed to invest it in the stock market, when you do certain missions Lester tells you about certain stocks. You can get up to a billion dollars that way

154 2018-12-26 23:15:11 @gouvernement vient de refaire les stocks avec un matériel encore plus perfectionné à 6 coups(au lieu de 3) sans recharger.
155 2018-12-26 23:14:59 JCPenney stock falls below $1 for the first time ever...so now I guess "penny stocks" have a whole new meaning...
156 2018-12-26 23:14:55 Stocks started going down as soon as they heard the Dems were taking over the house, the day after midterms
157 2018-12-26 23:14:49 Furthermore, one day of historic ‘gains’ may not compensate for years of lost investments.  If the stocks in his portfolio didn’t rise today, his movement may be flat or possibly a greater loss.
158 2018-12-26 23:14:45 Interesting, trump leaves the country and stocks rally...
159 2018-12-26 23:14:22 Trump's been off twitter the last 20 hours and if you think stocks jumping around like this is a good thing, I have lots questions for you..
160 2018-12-26 23:13:41 Thanks for following me.  These tweets we're about two different stocks.  I have maintained a huge cash position in order to take advantage of a market drop.  It is just harder than I thought to pull the trigger.
161 2018-12-26 23:13:28 getting seriously into stocks
162 2018-12-26 23:13:05 Well good job for your stocks and it’s up and downs ! Dead children are just down - GOP laughing fuck Ken in Pasadena pass over the dead for your stocks by damn !
163 2018-12-26 23:12:43 @jimcramer Hmm looks like we had a bottom at Christmas Eve. Given that this bull cycle is taking a pause I think value stocks with safe dividends might take the lead given that many baby boomer investors will feel it is their last chance to adjust their portfolios.
164 2018-12-26 23:12:24 Rich people buying the tanked stocks
165 2018-12-26 23:12:22 "When they go low", I try to buy.

168 2018-12-26 23:11:27 Great day with @IcemanTrading. Barry’s premarket plan was to long high beta stocks. Got good enough entries to comfortably overnight AAPL, SQ, TWLO and ROKU. When a trade is working my favorite phrase to say is stops in the money.

171 2018-12-26 23:10:47 I trust my account manager to do right by me.  He has been for years.   I'm 57 and semi retired and told him to keep most of my money in low risk stocks.   

I'd still like Charles to reimburse me for last weeks losses since he admits to accountability.  
172 2018-12-26 23:10:16 So first you're banning so called bump stocks and  acting against  2a,  but  now you're in Iraq chilling with some operators? Is this really the America we know? All of the power to the government, I suppose... Also, a lot of respect to these soldiers on a deployment 
173 2018-12-26 23:10:06 Great call Tom on the exhaustion in stocks.  it's showing up in several risk markets.  I'll send them over later.
174 2018-12-26 23:09:37 $DJIA Today had the largest Dow point change, but biggest single day % increase was 15.34% on Wednesday, March 15, 1933, when the newly elected President Roosevelt had (seemingly) restored economic confidence in the midst of the Great Depression. $DIA #stockmarket #stocks $SPY

177 2018-12-26 23:09:07 Yes the @DowJones had a 4digit increase 2Day. My opinion it was corporate/Day trippers buying back stocks (december losses) at very low prices.
178 2018-12-26 23:08:49 Article from @cnn "Investors went bargain shopping the day after Christmas, where stocks just got too cheap relative to earnings, future earnings, any reasonable assessment of earnings,". No they didn’t, volume was light, the PPT was in action and most of it was algo driven.
179 2018-12-26 23:08:20 Can't believe how quiet #StephenMoore is a day after saying .. the good news are #stocks are cheap... time to buy .... MUM today #trump's #MarketManipulation #AbuseofPower #CNN
180 2018-12-26 23:08:07 Hope you were a buyer today for stocks! Wow!
181 2018-12-26 23:08:03 The Dow Jones just had its highest gain in a day in history. If you own stocks, get out now. You heard it here first.
182 2018-12-26 23:08:02 So, let me get this straight, Trump leaves the country and stocks go up?!  Hmmmmmm
183 2018-12-26 23:07:55 Is there a method to #offset personal #carbonemissions which works by #investing in stocks such as solar power companies?
184 2018-12-26 23:07:51 Today was the biggest one-day rally in stocks since March 2009! That’s when investors found out that overly strict mark-to-market accounting was going to be suspended.
185 2018-12-26 23:07:39 Montel, you should delete your account as well. Everything in this tweet is wrong. We can still have operations reach in Syria from Iraq (right next to each other so you can learn), stocks largest point gain ever, POTUS & FLOTUS in Iraq yesterday. Be better.
186 2018-12-26 23:07:34 I told people this was going to happen buy low sell high this seems to happen around holidays. Oil stocks are down now because gas prices are lower. It’s a good time to buy stocks.
187 2018-12-26 23:06:45 So dredging/scrapping the bottom of the sea, destroying everything, is ok in your book!

The reason we have no fish zones, is the new boats, have destroyed & stripped the fishing waters, & fish stocks were nearly gone!
188 2018-12-26 23:05:22 After moves like today do you now believe me that I turned $5k into a peak at $535k? Trading options not stupid commons or stocks that’s for losers.... $100 into 11k trades today not me but $SPX and $SPy calls did that
189 2018-12-26 23:04:40 My 2 stocks ( I'm a "Poor" btw) are down a total of 32% since August. So that 1000 pts doesn't mean a lot to me. 
190 2018-12-26 23:03:56 Yeah, I didn't understand when a Facebook friend said something about selling his stocks a couple days ago, Monday I guess. It didn't seem to make sense to me. He was expecting it to keep dropping, maybe.
191 2018-12-26 23:03:52 estan hablando de stocks acciones en bolsa animal !!
192 2018-12-26 23:03:32 Me when I almost get two stocks from you
193 2018-12-26 23:03:14 Will Tech stocks rebound in 2019?
194 2018-12-26 23:03:02 My read on today. Someone put up the oil market which then triggered a short covering rally in stocks. In my experience, it's very dangerous when oil leads because of the day to day volatility in oil prices. Could/should the rally continue? Sure, a few more days is quite possible
195 2018-12-26 23:02:58 Did trump plan this out?  The Dow dropped, a lot.  He encourages traders to buy stocks.  Then, at the end of the session the Dow is up 1,000 points, making history.  Next, a surprise visit to troops in Iraq.  A special time for President, trump.
196 2018-12-26 23:02:17 Stocks roar back today, biggest one day gain ever for DJIA!

Great news of course. But from a policy perspective the real news is soaring confidence in the real economy: Consumers, Small Business, Manufacturers

Big Christmas numbers just posted too

Main St believes & expands
197 2018-12-26 23:01:38 It's called "Regression to the Mean," you dolts. Nobody who understands stocks or basic statistics was surprised about today.

And I'll point out that the Dow is still not back to the 26,000 it was at before it started trending downward around October 3rd.
198 2018-12-26 23:01:38 Biggest Xmas eve stock losses and biggest single day gain in the same week? That’s odd right? #stocks #useconomy #wildride
199 2018-12-26 23:01:34 Well, looks like we were wrong today. But in a happy kinda way since I own stocks.

210 2018-12-26 22:55:11 AP: Stocks rocketed on Wednesday in Wall Street's best day in 10 years, snapping a stomach-churning, four-day losing streak and giving some post-Christmas hope to a market that has been battered this December.
211 2018-12-26 22:54:57 Perhaps we could open an Ameritrade account in his name (but he wouldn't be authorized to buy or sell) & we could buy fossil fuel stocks to put in his portfolio.

213 2018-12-26 22:54:16 What stocks are y’all invested in
214 2018-12-26 22:53:16 Dead Cat Bounce. Too many stocks propped up by cheap money. Artificial low rates keep up the window dressing but don't make for a robust economy, just malinvestment.
215 2018-12-26 22:52:57 T'inquiètes mes stocks de mouchoirs sont près, j'en prépare toujours d'avance 
216 2018-12-26 22:52:37 as it has.  Nothing he has done, from a legislating standpoint, has served to reverse the rise in stocks.  Now, it’s more about the Feds and performance of global markets.  If he cuts a good deal with China, the DOW will sky rocket to $30k.  That’s why he is saying it is a good
217 2018-12-26 22:52:14 1 of 2: A notable range of views among experienced market participants as to the implications of today’s enormous #rally in US #stocks, including the biggest single-day point gain in history for the Dow.
Some see it as the start of a bigger move up, others as an opportunity to...
218 2018-12-26 22:51:17 De que hablas, que entiendes por stocks? Lo escribes como inventario? Las acciones han venido al alza.
219 2018-12-26 22:51:08 So Trump says and does lots of stupid things to drive down the market, then tells “people” to buy stocks, and then the market miraculously has its biggest day ever? SEC needs to be on top of who just made a killing in one day.
220 2018-12-26 22:51:04 Too much, it's a bubble. Also, stock markets do not indicate economic prosperity fir the people, only for the 1% who own 93% of stocks.
221 2018-12-26 22:50:54 Which part do you take issue with?  That stocks sometimes go up or that stocks sometimes go down?
222 2018-12-26 22:50:05 How are benchmarks performing? See for yourself.

235 2018-12-26 22:46:40 So much for the doom and gloom @TheDemocrats were gleeful about last week. Dems actually hope the economy will turn bad, so they can use it politically against @realDonaldTrump. Stocks rise and fall, no need to  cry "the sky is falling" every bad week. Trump's economy is strong!
236 2018-12-26 22:46:31 Just left Mary Poppins humming “Nowhere to Go But Up.”

243 2018-12-26 22:44:15 Today’s upswing was mostly due to energy stocks which rebounded as crude oil went up. So...higher gas prices will be a drag on the economy.
244 2018-12-26 22:44:14 Oh, the Canes were at the NYSE. No wonder stocks had a great day.
245 2018-12-26 22:43:49 Then tearing up the stocks and laughing to own the libs
246 2018-12-26 22:43:14 Some stocks are looking like crypto today. Dead cat bounce, but it’s an answer based on ideology tbh

These terrible #wealthy people must be shamed &or badgered into disgorging themselves of these stocks.
251 2018-12-26 22:41:19 So, the "correction" is over? WSJ says today stocks lost 8-12% this year. Should we be celebrating this one-day rally behind that news? Discuss.
252 2018-12-26 22:41:17 If our president has to own it whenever it’s down dear msm bless all your little hearts, than he gets to claim it when stocks are high and all is well.
253 2018-12-26 22:41:02 Them stocks are soaring and Trump is with our troops - you viral STD!
254 2018-12-26 22:40:39 Why I won’t buy stocks- no rhyme or reason.
255 2018-12-26 22:40:12 I hear that, but I think this bear market in stocks will be looong.
256 2018-12-26 22:39:57 Hoje ter estado a fazer stocks no frigorífico negativo fudeu me
257 2018-12-26 22:39:51 If I bought stocks today does that mean im an algorithm?
258 2018-12-26 22:39:42 Nah just divert and deflect from the 2nd child’s death in CBP custody, Mattis’ firing, trump shutdown, every org he’s involved with ow investigated, stocks down, down, down.... et al right @realDonaldTrump @potus
259 2018-12-26 22:39:42 And the stocks plummeted today....
260 2018-12-26 22:39:40 TRUMP LEAVES COUNTRY 

STOCKS SURGE 
261 2018-12-26 22:39:38 I’m sorry but this is a poor take. Plus the Dow is just a composite of only 30 stocks. It is pretty meaningless these days.
262 2018-12-26 22:39:32 @realDonaldTrump leaves the country and Stocks rise. 
263 2018-12-26 22:39:25 The fact the markets kept rising while company and government corruption was in plain site and then finally the truth caught up was the big story. The fact that the stocks rose again without much explanation only makes one realize how rigged the system is.
264 2018-12-26 22:39:23 With the big bounce in today’s markets, some hope a bull market in stocks is still possible. It isn’t. All negatives that drove the market down still exist: huge increase in debt from tax cut, isolationism, tariff war, incompetent government. Recession coming within in a year.
265 2018-12-26 22:39:05 ok, a bit obsessive, but  essential nonetheless, Yoda impersonators in stocks
266 2018-12-26 22:38:37 if you thought about it for more than 3 seconds and quit whining youd realize a global recession is extremely bearish for bitcoin + crypto

stocks go in the tank = crypto is going with it
267 2018-12-26 22:38:36 TRUMP LEAVES COUNTRY 

STOCKS SURGE 
268 2018-12-26 22:37:40 Did you know the stock market Fluctuates this way when it drops like it did people can afford to buy stocks then it rises so they can make money for you
269 2018-12-26 22:37:39 Some of my best performing #stocks today were $AMZN $TSLA $SQ $XPO & $NFLX #BoxingDay
270 2018-12-26 22:37:20 Dump your stocks when or if Democrats take office long as we have trump out economy will continue to boom. When interest rates drop back down oil prices continue to drop tariffs start to work red tape removed America will be better than it ever was
271 2018-12-26 22:37:15 Going live in 5! It’s all fake! Stocks, Cryptos and News! Trust logic!
272 2018-12-26 22:37:11 Chris has tRump stocks
273 2018-12-26 22:36:59 Shorts in the hole walking away from the #StockMarket today. Bear market rallies are the best. #stocks And on the day Trump went to Iraq. Is that what it took?
274 2018-12-26 22:36:56 TSX closed today....FYI...
Canadian Stocks ON the US market - today
Suncor - 27.60  +1.42 (+5.42%)
Royal Bank -  68.44  +2.08 (+3.13%)
TRP -   36.35   +0.88 (+2.48%)
CPG -    3.16   +0.43 (+15.75%) 
IMO - 25.79      +1.11 (+4.50%)
275 2018-12-26 22:36:36 How about a "pro" tip. Financial sources (from stocks,bonds,funds,etc), are a fantastic source of truthful assessments of what is going on in the country and the world. Finance people either tell the truth, or lose credibility. OR get prosecuted.
276 2018-12-26 22:36:25 Of course at the beginning of World War 2 cats and dogs were euthanised to conserve war time food stocks
277 2018-12-26 22:36:04 Bloody hell, Danny Murphy praising Puel’s tactics on #MOTD. I hope he realises the severity of such a crime. Send him to the stocks.
278 2018-12-26 22:35:57 Sr Petro aquí en esta afirmación suya..stocks se refiere al valor de las acciones..que está sufriendo los ajustes del mercado de Capitales al final del año.. y se han visto afectadas por contexto del negocio globalcómo se le ocurre hablar de inventarios que entre más bajos
279 2018-12-26 22:35:31 Kathleen is a qareen who trades stocks as a hobby.
280 2018-12-26 22:35:28 I dabble with PM so im used to dying at -4, but yeah considering how much damage and knockback a lot of moves do in ultimate, stocks get deleted in half a second
281 2018-12-26 22:35:18 Haha isn’t that the meaning of life? Kicking a ball, running for nothing, cycling in circles, trading bonds and stocks but never making money – being paid to invent narratives & maintain the lifestyle that takes you back to work tomorrow.... Reading Thoreau and taking a holiday

288 2018-12-26 22:33:01 Market Close: MBS -17bps; DOW +1,086.25; NASDAQ +361.44; S&P 500 +116.60; 10yr Treasury 2.81%; WOW!!!! Stocks & Yields make a MAJOR COMEBACK today, as pricing on Mortgage Rates crept up, but still supported by 200 DMA.
289 2018-12-26 22:32:56 I really don’t, & I wonder if the Saudis are buying stocks....hmmmmm.
290 2018-12-26 22:32:40 Biggest FU to hedge funds and CTA’s today. Just when CTA went max short, and L/S equity guys were forced out, you get a 5% rally as pensions are forced to rebalance into stocks. Disaster for them. Agree, Friday we start the march to 2250. Screwing everyone again.
291 2018-12-26 22:31:58 Listening to it right now. Very interesting about dividend stocks as protection. Can I, as part of popular demand, ask for a podcast on good dividend stocks? Something above 4% + value?
292 2018-12-26 22:31:50 put options on FAANG stocks let's see what happens tomorrow
293 2018-12-26 22:31:43 Yeah... need to convert more stocks to cash. Crazy times.
294 2018-12-26 22:31:36 Fact: High emotions are not conducive to good investing. (we need to take a breath.) #stocks
295 2018-12-26 22:31:36 I had a winning year this year thanks to my broker who got me out of crap stocks. I had a winning year in 2017 with crap stocks when everything was winning. The reality is this is not a market for crap stocks and some times you need a slap in the face otherwise you get punched.
296 2018-12-26 22:31:29 Es que es muy bestia! Confundir inventarios con stocks en ese contexto! muy animal @petrogustavo
297 2018-12-26 22:31:18 ...so for well educated investors...you don’t invest in stocks and watch the market on a day to day basis, but are concerned about the long game 
298 2018-12-26 22:30:56 Ever notice when Trump leaves the country the stocks go up? 
299 2018-12-26 22:30:49 Fundamental discretionary traders" (like 401k holders) account for only about 10% of trading volume in stocks; most trading these days is passive & quantitative investing - computer and algorithmic driven
300 2018-12-26 22:30:47 Sarah got me into an elitist airport lounge wherein I had several free house reds and I have one thought:

We are appallingly silent about the fact that every public restroom only ever stocks one ply toilet paper. Hemorrhoids are an epidemic.
301 2018-12-26 22:30:09 Apparently they were a big enough issue at SoCal locals that they suddenly moved the timer up. Historically, lower amounts of minutes leads to higher amounts of timeouts. Stocks can go quick but camping is crazy strong rn.
302 2018-12-26 22:29:37 @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer I noticed you sent tweets about the recent stock market downturns, but didn’t notice your tweets about the best day in stocks history....12/26/18.
@realDonaldTrump
303 2018-12-26 22:29:34 Puts on CFA cap...
Buy the lowest MER S&P 500 ETF you can. As a portfolio manager, unless you are godlike and keep your fund small you'll likely never exceed the averages. Statistically once you have >30 stocks you're basically the broader index.
304 2018-12-26 22:28:58 Who's buying all the stocks?
305 2018-12-26 22:28:25 Liberals yesterday: I knew Trump was bad for stocks!
Conservatives yesterday: No we're still in the Obama Economy
Liberals today: The Volatility!  Um...Trump's fault still!  Lets watch Now This, Race Bait edition
Conservatives: MAGA!  Lets build another confederate statue!  Yay!
306 2018-12-26 22:28:03 Update post close as I update my stuff. Wow, a good day for stocks in the end. Lately where they open doesn't have a heck of a lot to do with where they close. Crazy swings, this time to the upside. STILL DOWN TREND, FULL HEDGES, although one day has us back into the range. ETR!
307 2018-12-26 22:27:54 HOLIDAY SHOPPING SPARKS RETAIL RALLY

DONALD TRUMP SAYS BUY STOCKS FOR THE 37TH TIME THIS YEAR

SANTA CLAUS RALLY IS BACK FOLKS
308 2018-12-26 22:27:32 A lot of very excited folks in my tl. It seems the people on the markets with the stocks have been buying more than selling today.
309 2018-12-26 22:27:31 And climate change is fake because it's cold in winter. We get it. You look at a single event and make a decision when it fits your narrative. The action of how 30 stocks move the Dow doesn't mean a recession isn't coming. Just like how Chicken POTUS showing up in Iraq fixes it.
310 2018-12-26 22:27:24 Think the U.S. fairs better than the two you mentioned... depends on how much Fed money is rolled out of stocks (trillions of dollars were bought during Obama admin after crash in ‘08). Dow lost 50% from Oct’07 peak to Mar’09 close.
311 2018-12-26 22:27:14 I think gold and gold stocks will still hold up reasonably well even if markets rally here for a while.  They re-established haven utility (not always the case) in this savage downturn, and people will want to keep/buy some for insurance against further volatility.
312 2018-12-26 22:27:02 Thank god you were there, think what would've happened if that weed was smoked! The restaurants of New York would have never been able to protect their stocks from the munchies!
313 2018-12-26 22:26:28 Stocks soar after disastrous Christmas Eve; Dow closes up over 1,000 points and all it took was for tRump to leave America.  Just think how the market would do if tRump never came back!
#TrumpResign
314 2018-12-26 22:26:18 The “gains” are due to corporations buying back their stocks  - paid for with the tax cuts that were supposed to create jobs and raise wages.  Corporate greed on the backs of the middle class!
315 2018-12-26 22:26:17 I thought something was weird when my two stocks that have been plummeting for weeks both jumped 3% and 6.6% today
316 2018-12-26 22:25:50 @DougKass You got the 5% right which will stand as a really memorable call. Yet none of your "... Top Ten possible events that could cause stocks to rise by at least 5% in one trading session" served as the catalyst. What do you make of that? Honest question. I'm puzzled
317 2018-12-26 22:25:34 It’s over sold stocks are cheap...house spouse and dog on Jan S&P^^^
318 2018-12-26 22:25:28 Stocks fly as soon as Trump flies. Correlation or causation?
319 2018-12-26 22:25:20 Wells Fargo rebalances $64 B bonds into stocks. Look at the $djia
320 2018-12-26 22:25:16 HISTORIC DAY: Stocks Jump 1,084+ POINTS in Biggest ‘Single-Day Gain’ in US History
321 2018-12-26 22:25:05 Jared, I know I am a neophyte, but over last month we have seen 1B to sell MOC regularly and it seems to be handled with very little price dislocation. Is that number based on individual stocks, not SPY. Be nice , pretend I am a CCC student AND a sub, please
322 2018-12-26 22:24:28 If I spend $1 million on a bunch of stocks that just cratered, and they gain back 1%, and I sell them, I just made $10,000. Simplistic, but that’s the idea. And they will bounce back if enough of my rich fans also try this. All the interest drives the price up.
323 2018-12-26 22:24:25 My biggest issue is that the DJIA is one of the most useless indices with only 30 stocks and there's a 'survivor' bias baked in as well
324 2018-12-26 22:24:10 (2/2) Trying to counter irrational emotion w/rationality is a frequent,  tactical, error of the right.

@realDonaldTrump argues like a Liberal,  and knows how to control the narrative. IMNSHO, Preemptively banning JUST bump stocks,  administratively,  was a tactical masterstroke.
325 2018-12-26 22:23:56 The #PermanentPortfolio up 0.91% on a great day for stocks.

327 2018-12-26 22:22:09 Trump opens mouth: stocks plummet

Trump closes mouth: everything else plummets
328 2018-12-26 22:22:03 ... Trump get the blame when stocks crash. Is it a #TrumpCrash? No! Maybe put blame on the #FederalReserve, the Bank of England and the City of London (The Crown) but no. You fools don’t know how #Freemasons run the City of London and that’s the real financial center. The ...
329 2018-12-26 22:21:48 Stocks are not bad but they have been really good.   Can’t fire? Just wait
330 2018-12-26 22:21:33 Stocks just reported biggest one day gain in history today. There ... baby want a bottle. See DT and Mrs having fun with the troops in Iraq. They love seeing them there. No one is looking for you!--! Hahahahaha
331 2018-12-26 22:21:28 As of Monday's close. DOW was down 4,000 pts in past 3 weeks. But the top 1% of wealthiest Americans own 40% of the DOW. Trump cut their taxes in billions. They didn't hire much. Just used gov't tax breaks to Buy more stocks. Become wealthier. Hence, their bubble has burst.
332 2018-12-26 22:20:54 Use case: freedom

333 2018-12-26 22:20:52 Señorita sirvame unos "stocks" en salsa. No señor. Hoy tenemos bolsas plasticas. De la casa. Bien, señorita. Pero las quiero con buen billete y a fuego lento.
334 2018-12-26 22:20:28 And stocks roar as government is shut down. Hmm .
335 2018-12-26 22:19:32 4.98% rise today so depending on how you're leveraged buying when stocks were down 10% was a Christmas Gift! 
336 2018-12-26 22:19:26 How’s your stocks doing today?
337 2018-12-26 22:19:15 I’m not sure the military stocks any XXXL camo...
338 2018-12-26 22:18:50 Yea I think there is a long road to regulating the market properly and no one is even talking about it yet. The goal is to create a stock market that will go up slowly and individual stocks will rise or fall based on how they do with less irrational price movements.
339 2018-12-26 22:18:18 There you go. Day after Christmas stocks had the biggest single day increase ever. Relax. Have a homebrew.
340 2018-12-26 22:18:01 on the one hand this is the first day in a long time that all my stocks have risen, and on the other hand I am still over 18% down.
341 2018-12-26 22:17:53 @realDonaldTrump Stocks UP 1084 - means YOUR message got through to your supporters (us) & TO American people & stock buyers/sellers: Govt stays closed until wall financed; people are donating money to finance it & BIGGEST of all - the Left, Deep State & Powell PLUNGED markets.
342 2018-12-26 22:17:49 A lot of stupid people were buying stocks because they think we've reached the bottom.
343 2018-12-26 22:17:44 I could have sold but I’m keeping my stocks and will buy more because I know they will make a huge profit in future
344 2018-12-26 22:17:30 Na I’m good lol but I have apple stocks, so keeping buying shit
345 2018-12-26 22:17:20 En este caso stocks son acciones, no inventarios.

348 2018-12-26 22:17:08 For the first time in awhile got the notification that stocks went up
349 2018-12-26 22:16:56 Kim, lives on Morningside Canyon with husband.

Put all their savings into banana stocks. Can't retire.
350 2018-12-26 22:16:54 When I’m at work I always stay away from the political/presidential discussions but this one mf at my job loves bringing Trump and stocks to start conversation and I’m forced to put on a fake laugh and smile 
351 2018-12-26 22:15:59 Most people just don’t have a clue and should never be in stocks or play the game ever. 1) FED very stupid this year, add in Dems  2) Year end, NEW tax rules coming, cripes  3) Sheep not understanding = most of the panic  4) Corrections long overdue. Zero to do with Trump. 
352 2018-12-26 22:15:20 So the Plunge Protection Team includes officials from the Federal Reserve as well as the SEC.  But what do they do exactly?  Conspire to freeze rates or suspend SEC rules, then call institutional investors to pump the stocks?  Does the US Govt buy stocks?  How does it happen?
353 2018-12-26 22:15:12 When stocks fall....Trump's fault. When they gain...... crickets sound off. 
The stocks by the way that "the rich" or the so called 1% who's money the the so called "oppressed"  want to just take and divide.
354 2018-12-26 22:14:32 Yes keep propping dem stocks up so that people put their wealth in them and then control every single aspects of the traditional market.
Pump and dump.

357 2018-12-26 22:13:16 In my view crypto currency is not an investment it is a speculation is a short term just like stocks and online trading, you have greater chances you will get burnt. Investing is long term and shares and ETF's is your net cause you are able to cross T's and dot I's.#Entrepreneur

362 2018-12-26 22:12:50 Ummmm, you didn't read the article, did you? Also, we know he is out of the country because stocks rebounded a bit.
363 2018-12-26 22:12:46 Looks like Santa Claus has turned up twice in three days. The Dow Jones up 5% and our market poised for huge gains today especially in energy stocks with oil up nearly 10% #merryxmas

365 2018-12-26 22:11:52 What's the deal with stocks associated with cannabis?
366 2018-12-26 22:11:51 Maybe whoever all were selling so hard got done. Or maybe the pause is happenstance. Only time will tell. Intuitively stocks had been oversold for quite a while.
367 2018-12-26 22:11:49 Why isnt tRump still bragging about stock market? 
ex:If the Dems  got elected, your stocks would be down 50% from values on Election Day
    what a goober...
368 2018-12-26 22:11:00 I'm back to feeling Bullish on Stocks!!!!
369 2018-12-26 22:10:22 Stocks vaults over 1000 points, biggest gain in history!!
370 2018-12-26 22:10:08 Lots of people losing lots of money! Whipsaw shaking people off stocks and poor people with puts and calls needlessly the shorts.
371 2018-12-26 22:10:04 Btc has little if any correlation to stocks. Maybe in a crisis(not in one)

Not sure where this idea started.
372 2018-12-26 22:09:59 All this "stocks are going to crash Wednesday". Biggest gain in one day for the DJIA ever 
373 2018-12-26 22:09:57 you need a better tracking system. He's been absolutely destroyed. He's down over 25% just on his bank stocks even after today, he's no where close to even on his SPY long trade he put on two weeks ago.
374 2018-12-26 22:09:37 And by the way...stocks are bought and sold daily...TRADED. Billions of shares...ANYONE CAN BUY THEM....if you can afford shares in quantity or buy single digits. It doesn’t matter. I know this because I buy and trade stock every day, and I’m not a millionaire.
375 2018-12-26 22:09:30 Cadet Bones Spurs is the biggest hypocrite in US  history. Five deferments for fake bone spurs during Viet Nam. "My Viet Nam was spent trying not to get an STD"...Donald Trump.

You have no shame Bradley. How'd your stocks do last week, BTW?
376 2018-12-26 22:09:09 Is it lost on his staff that as soon as he stopped tweeting, stocks went up 1000 points???  
377 2018-12-26 22:09:08 Should flip bitcoin for stocks though
378 2018-12-26 22:09:01 Trump leaves the country. Stocks soar 1000+ points. I think we’re on to something here. Individual #1 should stay in Iraq.
379 2018-12-26 22:08:58 Stocks surged today, the same day the president left the country....coincidence i think not

384 2018-12-26 22:08:10 So don't login stock and 401K accounts during down days.  Eventually those money will be buying stocks again.
385 2018-12-26 22:08:06 I am pretty sure neither Hussman, Kass , or even Jjc thinks we have seen a real bottom. Me, I keep reading this guy who says to watch price action in individual stocks.

387 2018-12-26 22:07:22 top economist said the media and democrats are lying about the economy that is bouncing back. Major gains on the dow and stocks. Dow making history in gains. They also said don't listen to the lies by the media there jealous of what the president can do
388 2018-12-26 22:06:58 We played a game where we had 2 stocks vs: Bayonetta, Cloud, Heavies with kill confirms at 50, Rage, Fox/Luigi killing us at 0, Falcon robbing us, Mario Up B killing you at 10, MK ladders killing us at 30, ZSS killing us at 30 with a grab, KO punch killing us at 5, and Ryu.

Get a meme for this one!
393 2018-12-26 22:05:42 WALL STREET HATES TRUMP. ECONOMY IS STRONG, NO REASON FOR STOCKS TO TANK BEFORE XMAS. GLOBES DID THIS ON PURPOSE BEFORE XMAS TO HURT TRUMP. MEANWHILE YOUR IRA TANKED.
394 2018-12-26 22:05:35 Spending 160 on some Air Pods instead of investing in some stocks lmao who raised y’all
395 2018-12-26 22:05:29 . @marketplace, yesterday you blamed @realDonaldTrump criticism of Fed Chair for "plummeting" stocks. Will you give credit to @POTUS for stocks going up today? Your reporting is so biased. Ready to attack #Trump every chance you get. Sell your stocks now and be grateful to #Trump
396 2018-12-26 22:05:16 The continued obsession with FAANG stocks in light of recent $MSFT performance is… interesting.
397 2018-12-26 22:05:14 Continue to maintain a list of stocks exhibiting the most strength, so as to be ready for anything that comes our way. In the meantime, we would continue to minimize exposure and never forget, cash IS a position and often an extremely effective one. $SPX $COMPQ

400 2018-12-26 22:04:09  Wall St fat cats figured out that owning themselves to own the Fed wasn’t the best strategy so they bought up all those severely oversold stocks that were oversold because the fat cats dumped them because they were upset that 0% interest rates wasn’t the new normal. 
401 2018-12-26 22:03:37 I’ve seen penny stocks halted when going up.
402 2018-12-26 22:03:25 Please don't sideline the fact that @FabianDelph17 always costs us points, games and momentum coach. We starting to look like laughing stocks because of a place who doesn't seem to take our game seriously anymore. Ever since the Wigan game last season. Please release him in Jan

404 2018-12-26 22:02:54 I got in a big argument with my lib uncle on Christmas about the Fed. I still love him and he still loves me but I told him the markets will get back in shape and Trump is not responsible for the weird shit going on with the Stocks and Dow.
405 2018-12-26 22:02:53 Stocks owned by the FEDS I wouldn't keep my stocks that is for sure...Kennedy tried to take over the Feds and was Killed ? Yep DIRTY people own our Stocks and Banking Systems "ROTHS"

409 2018-12-26 22:02:17 Higher rates would depress gold. Gold will move when we see Powell signal to the market December was the last rate hike and balance sheet unwinding is on hold. Load up on your favourite gold stocks with gold most likely topping for now.
410 2018-12-26 22:02:06 Noooooo stop I’m down 10000 on stocks 
411 2018-12-26 22:02:03 The way I see it they're all so jealousTrump beats them at their own game- under Trump gas the lowest for 77 days running- the stocks have the highest one day gain in history-China & No.Ko.pressed to do the right thing-NATO forced to pay their fair share-U.S.pulling out of Syria.
412 2018-12-26 22:01:53 Stocks are on sale when the market is down.
413 2018-12-26 22:01:45 Dow soars over 1,000 points as stocks bounce back from Christmas Eve meltdown
414 2018-12-26 22:01:21 Big day for stocks tomorrow - massive gains in the US - about time! Lots of companies looking very cheap right now! Time to deploy that Christmas cash into #VRS 
415 2018-12-26 22:01:11 Stocks are down 650 pts on Monday and it’s Trumps fault, 2 days later their up 1000 pts and it’s because of Obama. 
416 2018-12-26 22:00:49 LOL?? where do you people come from. Kass has been screaming to buy for 3 weeks, and to buy banks stocks for two months. He's been destroyed. he just keeps saying to buy so he can brag when the market finally goes up
417 2018-12-26 22:00:22 You both are such losers... 
HISTORIC DAY: Stocks Jump 1,084+ POINTS in Biggest ‘Single-Day Gain’ in US History... 
Not to mention the lies like he didn't go to see the troops...
418 2018-12-26 21:59:46 Trump wasn’t responsible for stocks tanking and he had nothing to do with today.
419 2018-12-26 21:59:44 The stocks are more manipulated than football matches, and this is a rise before the flood.
420 2018-12-26 21:59:24 As usual Jimmy is an after the move prognosticator and comically takes credit. His dumb money teaser all day on CNBC was anti stocks. You would have missed the greatest gain. Keep at it squeaks
421 2018-12-26 21:59:12 Today, the US stocks had the biggest rally since March 2009

423 2018-12-26 21:57:51 Who else thinks the dow is rigged? Who pushed the stocks back up? The Russians the Turks the Saudis or the devil?
424 2018-12-26 21:57:36 A large swing to the upside wasn't unsurprising given both low trading volume and the fact that there are a lot of stocks out there at bargain prices
425 2018-12-26 21:57:30 a nice comeback, but not enough to close out 2018

434 2018-12-26 21:56:00 Talk about fear mongering !! Stocks soar 1000 points........ biggest single day gain in history. Let me guess..... stocks dipped because of President Trump but soared back because of Obama , right ? Pretty sure that's how you'll try to spin it again
435 2018-12-26 21:55:42 Retail stocks lift the market every December... check your 401k and tell me who did that! Now who’s the sheep! 
436 2018-12-26 21:55:29 1) The Media just reports what you say and do, nothing more. 2) I thought you were going to make Mexico pay for that wall? 3) Look at the your stocks, the stock market is plummeting because of YOUR gov shutdown and trade wars. 4) You didn't even visit the troops.
437 2018-12-26 21:55:06 And thinking ov buying 40$ calls for Jan 25 #stocks
438 2018-12-26 21:54:54 No. It’s just planned that way stewie. They sold it right to the technicals and then funds come in at eom scoop up cheap stocks causing fomo in retailers and here we go. Lil gift to the funds. #manipulation
439 2018-12-26 21:54:54 Not coincidentally, my unweighted avg of 1207 liquid stocks had a +5.08% day.
440 2018-12-26 21:54:47 I won’t apologize to anyone for thinking and stating Trumps trip to Iraq is a PR stunt born out of the necessity to counter the negative narrative he’s written.  If Trump cared, he’d have visited them long before now and not after Mattis, shutdown, stocks and kids dying.
441 2018-12-26 21:54:43 I don’t think stocks like this normally care about the mkt.
442 2018-12-26 21:54:34 Except the FAANG stocks?
443 2018-12-26 21:54:23 Definitivamente ese guerrillero camuflado debe saber mucho de los SPX Stocks y el Real Time Trade and investing... debe ser que ese concepto lo saco de los “Stocks” que guarda entre bolsas... y recibe en la clandestinidad.....

449 2018-12-26 21:52:50 At the WH yesterday, the President said it was a good time to buy stocks. Apparently some people listened.
450 2018-12-26 21:52:39 So ya gotta be loving the stock market today.

Hopefully, you bought stocks when they were on discount last week.
451 2018-12-26 21:52:38 GREAT news, Sean. People have more money in their paychecks to invest in their retirements & stocks
452 2018-12-26 21:52:31 @FOXTV To fake news Fox- Show your President more respect, he is the best you A/hole Yankees have had!!!   Stocks up  President Trump is a genius,.,!!!
453 2018-12-26 21:52:26 Exactly...these colonizers faking the stocks increases. @hwmnylx69 @rolandsmartin
454 2018-12-26 21:51:49 oh thank you wise pinneapple.
1) the fluff tech stocks should go down. twitter and facebook are crap.
2) the left and cnn want to blame Trump for any downturn. and are trying tactics to make it fall.
455 2018-12-26 21:51:45 Or as CNN might report it:  Stocks make historic one-day gain - damnit!
456 2018-12-26 21:51:33 Stocks ended today with the biggest one day gain in the history of the stock market...+ 1085.25 almost a 5% gain in one day! #MAGA.
457 2018-12-26 21:51:10 I’m bullish real economy still, but not stocks in general.

This is a keeper
459 2018-12-26 21:50:41 @krassenstein you're a dying breed friend. Enjoy the stocks k? Btw, go suck a Blumenthal. Ha! Ps. Go dry chucks tears and SHUTDOWN Nancy smears. Disgusting human friend. Quite appalling.
460 2018-12-26 21:50:15 it's like pulling teeth.  try getting an old guy like 75 years old to get off his Ameritrade account, sell his stocks, and buy XRP and set up 2RFA and then warn him not to get the private key wrong by one digit or he loses his money, watch out for phishing, + Ledger Nano S.  
461 2018-12-26 21:50:06 So I’ve got a decent amount of money in stocks now and, I may be wrong, but I feel like a bear would win in a fight against a bull.... although I guess in reality I couldn’t win a fight against either of them so I truly don’t know what’s going to happen to my money
462 2018-12-26 21:50:01 I don't buy stocks because they've gone down the most. I buy stocks that refuse to go down in the first place. I don't buy extended and I don't buy on sale.

By the way, bump stocks we're a novelty in the gun community. No one really bought them. That company had a warehouse full they couldn't sell 

Until, people started calling for their banning.

466 2018-12-26 21:49:29 Trump said to buy this dip and he knows what his plan is for China. I wouldn't bet against that insider info. He doesn't get re-elected if stocks tank especially after telling everyone to buy this dip. This is the bottom.
467 2018-12-26 21:49:19 LOL. hey, if you keep saying to buy for the last 20%, I guess the market will go up one day. Not that kass actually trades stocks but he's been saying to buy for the last 3 weeks. He's been destroyed
468 2018-12-26 21:49:07 That’s just shrewd investors buying up oversold stocks.

470 2018-12-26 21:49:00 I didn't have much in short-term equities but got out on October 5th and also starting telling friends, posting, tweeting, etc. to get out of stocks for a bit while we get this correction. Also, I've seen similar moves like today during the 2008-2009 crash
471 2018-12-26 21:48:46 Please don't forget context of tax break,  buy backs and profitable volatility.  Who owned the stocks that were sold high and who bought low? With a gutted reg and investigative irs. Clever.
472 2018-12-26 21:48:15 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Fake Bone Spurs, collusion, tax fraud, golden shower, infidelity, stocks crashing, tax breaks 4 rich! #TrumpResign
473 2018-12-26 21:48:14 Nice "V" pattern on multiple stocks and indexes with VOLUME towards the end of the trading day...Hahahaha those "algo" painting a beautiful piece.... Everything is manipulated, everything, once you got the money and the connection its a casino with steroids

476 2018-12-26 21:47:53 and finally the RALLY of all RALLIES.. interesting how large players needed to get out of bonds and into stocks at low prices. retail just bought high and sold low!! rally was better than ever anticipated!!

478 2018-12-26 21:47:19 Thanks boss!
479 2018-12-26 21:47:14 Market is still in good shape. Interest rates going up always hurt stocks and we will see some more volatility, but we will be better off in the end. Sorry, but the sky isn’t falling, Cris.
480 2018-12-26 21:47:03 One day in Q4 when retirement funds have to rebalance target funds by buying a bunch of stocks before years end really changes never-Trumper minds? Maybe you dislike him for the wrong reasons.

482 2018-12-26 21:46:45 10 year bull market on stocks will not die overnight or in one months or three months.  Expect big bull trap.
483 2018-12-26 21:46:44 YM pulls stocks numbers out their ass. No one says anything. Other pages put stock numbers out, YM calls them out saying they’re trying to get attention
484 2018-12-26 21:46:39 Holy fuck my stocks, I might be able to retire again
485 2018-12-26 21:46:29 a test of $IWM recent low may converge with the uptrend line from 2009. we r going to have a fascinating earnings period. Optimist until that uptrend line is broken. Alot of stocks already put in heavy lifting on the downside.
486 2018-12-26 21:46:19 1.Stocks rallied
2. Trump visited the troops
3. Mattis knew what he was getting into
4. #Democrats killed the two kids with incoherent border policy that is meant to deceive
5. Since when have Democrats started calling for was (hint: TDS)
6. You are wrong on all counts
487 2018-12-26 21:45:48 Stocks posted their best day in nearly a decade on Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average notching its largest one-day point gain in history
488 2018-12-26 21:45:47 Expect Trump to tweet about his comment yesterday that it was "a great opportunity" to buy stocks.  He won't be able to control his impulse to take credit for pluses any more than he can control his impulse to blame others for the minuses.
489 2018-12-26 21:45:39 Stocks score broad rally; Dow racks up biggest one-day point gain in history
490 2018-12-26 21:45:26 When markets collapse, @CNBC invites on camera guests predicting the world's coming to an imminent end. When markets soar, @CNBC invites on camera guests predicting ample room to run as stocks are cheap. Sending Ritalin care package to their headquarters as a New Year's good deed
491 2018-12-26 21:45:17 I pulled out of quite a few growth stocks a little too late, but I'm glad I got out before this shit show. Sadly, plenty of folks will see this as an opportunity to "buy low." It's end of Q4, of course stocks are up.
492 2018-12-26 21:45:17 I’m as skittish as anyone with this recent action, but the corporate earnings are FAR more grounded than in the late 90’s. Certain stocks are in a “bubble”, but I don’t think the entire market is.

#Cannabis

3 red states in the US voted in favor of legalization measures and plenty of pro-legalization candidates took the keys to governors' mansions in midterm elections. 

On Wall Street, everyone  was talking about pot stocks, from #Tilray to #Cronos.
500 2018-12-26 21:44:11 Don't know much about stocks, but believe the confidence of American citizens today is due to POTUS 45 holding firm to FUND IMPENETRABLE SOUTHERN BORDER STRUCTURE S

Plus 45's pulling troops out of Syria, so as it should be UAE and Saudi Arabia move troops into Syria#MAGA
501 2018-12-26 21:43:41 Trump said to buy stocks... maybe that was it
502 2018-12-26 21:43:27 The stocks are soaring right now. What planet are you living on dip terd.
503 2018-12-26 21:43:23 Every day at 4:25 I sell all my stocks, then buy them again the next day at 9:35am... you’re a sucker if you have stocks going at night while the market’s closed
504 2018-12-26 21:43:09 When stocks drop prices so drastically, it is natural that investors will buy cheap.
505 2018-12-26 21:43:07 How long before Trump tweets "no one" reporting big day for stocks?
506 2018-12-26 21:42:51 @StephenMoore are ya happy ya get to manipulate the economy and buy up some cheap stocks ...? #US Prepare for a crash ...  NO ONE like Volatile markets with a volatile co called acting president #TraitorTot goes to #Iraq #CNN #StephenMoore Moron

508 2018-12-26 21:41:44 Stocks are still set for losses for the year and why the Trump picture?
509 2018-12-26 21:41:35 Why would you not accept that Nuclear has had a ton of accidents? The Fermi 1, SL-1, sub  meltdowns have nothing to do with stocks that I bought nor does any accident.  I dont short stocks nor do I work with shorters.  I dont think I am nuts since the info is easy to find.
510 2018-12-26 21:41:31 Dems win the house, and stocks plummet. Coincidence? I think not.
511 2018-12-26 21:40:49 Open up a shelter for teen moms/abused minors. New recreation centers for the neighborhoods in my city. Invest highly into stocks, pay my debt & spoil my kids. Everything else is savings? Why? Because good ’s go to heaven and longevity matters!
512 2018-12-26 21:40:45 The rally was because several large corporations had good Christmas figures.  Also, retirement funds bought chunks of "good" stocks while they were down (Bear Market), thus creating the SMALL rally.  Stock market is still considerably down for the year.
513 2018-12-26 21:40:22 Trump leaves the country to visit the troops. Stocks surge 2%. Coincidence?
514 2018-12-26 21:39:57 If you want safety, then also seriously consider better gun control/ban on assault weapons/bump stocks.  Illegal immigrants commit fewer crimes than US born.
515 2018-12-26 21:39:57 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
516 2018-12-26 21:39:53 ugh I could really smack myself for not purchasing those stocks when the Dow dropped drastically last week smh nothing but gains all day today 
517 2018-12-26 21:39:49 Big news on the Economy: Dow rises 1086 today, the biggest daily point gain ever - after the worst ever Christmas Eve for stocks. #StockMarket

519 2018-12-26 21:39:01 News on iphone yesterday : trump first president since 2002 to not visit troops on xmas / and with no sign of govt return, stocks plummet -- today: trump and first lady make secret trip to Iraq to visit troops - and, dow up 1000 points, biggest single day ever 
520 2018-12-26 21:38:39 Invest into stocks, build my 401k, established credit score, get me a car and move out the country
521 2018-12-26 21:38:29 Low interest rate environment helped fuel bull market during his Presidency. Rising interest rate environment Generally doesn’t help stocks
522 2018-12-26 21:38:12 The rich oligarchs are the ones playing with the stocks. It has nothing to do with any government official.
523 2018-12-26 21:37:57 And just like that, stocks are bouncing back up with the biggest daily point gain ever today. 

The world is not ending folks. 

Like @ScottAdamsSays has said, the stock market is based on news headlines...majority of which is #FakeNews.
524 2018-12-26 21:37:39 Natural stocks are low, the only thing we are guaranteed in abundance is bullshit
525 2018-12-26 21:37:32 I guess the rally was dur to rich people buying up the stocks that the middle class sold out of panic. Just widen that gap. No problem.
526 2018-12-26 21:37:17 Fishy business: markets were agitated, stocks down sting, now stocks bounce back in less than 2 days (of which one was a holiday) with record gain...investigation needed on who’s making money out of all of this! (Guess who...)
527 2018-12-26 21:37:13 NPR just now: "on Wall Street, stocks finished higher."

This was after a long segment on gay marriage in Brazil. As usual, NPR is beyond parody
528 2018-12-26 21:37:09 Truth be told I have very little knowledge of stocks, the stock market and what exactly it "means" in terms of our economy. I mean, the opposite of bigly knowledge.

If you see me quote RT with "MAGA" generally it's sarcasm as a lot of it probably has little to do with the POTUS
529 2018-12-26 21:37:08 Good question. 
1) Key bearish reversal during Oct 2018.
2) Dec 18 has seen the DJIA move below the previous low of 23,344 from Apr 18.
Looking now for series of lower highs and lower lows, classic definition of a downtrend. 
However, keep in mind Rule #5: Stocks go up over time.
530 2018-12-26 21:36:48 Someone at the Times should check the correlation of Trump being out of D.C. and stocks going up. R-Square is probably 0.90.

That or the #PPT is using fed money to buy up stocks as fake investors.

533 2018-12-26 21:36:13 As always, “someone” knew this news was coming and they got the first whack at the cheap stocks. Now the rest of us get to hear it :)
534 2018-12-26 21:36:12 U.S. stocks rebounded from the brink of a bear market, with the S&P 500 up almost 5 percent after weeks of losses.
535 2018-12-26 21:36:12 Trump signaled his billionaire buddies this morning with the "buy stocks" quote which I have been expecting for some time.  This whole thing seems a bit rigged for the downswing and I do think the biggest-boys out there are controlling this.
536 2018-12-26 21:36:00 Stocks soar 5%, Dow adds record breaking 1,086 points in one day, retail services during holidays the highest in 10 years, China reduced car tariffs from 40% to 15%. #MAGA @realDonaldTrump has much to be grateful for. TY POTUS! #WWG1WGA
537 2018-12-26 21:35:42 millennials brought back the economy and all your shitty stocks from the precipice by buying so many video game systems, edibles and fancy lunchables and we can put it right back in a heartbeat so watch it
538 2018-12-26 21:35:41 $DJI +$1086.00 something happen today to cause this swing? #stocks #trading #StockMarket
539 2018-12-26 21:35:32 Of course. It was bargain day as the markets reopened. Scooping up cheap stocks does result in market rallies.

541 2018-12-26 21:35:29 Great News 

U.S. stocks staged a ferocious rally on Wednesday, coming back from steep losses on Christmas Eve. The Dow and S&P 500 gained almost 5%, with the Dow up more than 1,000 points for a historic surge. The Nasdaq charged ahead, closing up more than 5.8%.
542 2018-12-26 21:35:25 SIEMPRE A 5 STOCKS!! Quien puede ser tan desagradable de jugar a 3? Esa gente no conoce la adrenalina!

546 2018-12-26 21:34:34 This is laughable. Last week experts predicted a market meltdown, further plunging stocks in 2019 & a recession. Today everything is great; 2019 will be a banner year, stock market will take off & Fed will lower rates. Experts are almost as crazy & unpredictable as Trump!
547 2018-12-26 21:34:33 When individual stocks have corrected 40-50% and the crowd says a bear mkt (look at the retail sales) and they are wrong you have to worry about the upside risk as well
548 2018-12-26 21:34:23 Well Kurt!!! Stocks are much cheaper now so if you hang in for the long haul (which is what a 401K does)!! You’ll be so much richer when the market comes running back!!! And for blaming Trump for your Renal Failure?? You’re a Disgrace!! I will@however Pray very for you!!!

550 2018-12-26 21:34:13 The DOW has it's own issues. All of the rich are selling their stocks and the common people are getting them in their 401K's now. No one else is buying them.

558 2018-12-26 21:33:17 As soon as word came that this dotard was on the other side of the PLANET -in danger amidst an active battlefield, no less- came news that the Dow Jones saw a historic record rise in points for the day: Gaining nearly some 5%!

Coincidence? Nah: Stocks love a world without Trump!
559 2018-12-26 21:32:50 I never understood stocks until you just explained it, thank you.

566 2018-12-26 21:32:00 When there’s a huge drop in the market there’s speculators standing by to buy up low-priced stocks. Their purchases drive the price back up. You just witnessed the wealthy make a ton more money in real time.
567 2018-12-26 21:31:44 Idk anything about the economy but a couple of months ago an economist was telling everyone to NOT PANIC and DEFINITELY DONT GET RID OF YOUR STOCKS which I know means a big ass crash is on the horizon
568 2018-12-26 21:31:44 Stock Market up big time today...better change your comments again and throw credit back to Obama again for Stocks. LOL

570 2018-12-26 21:31:24 Crypto markets are not any more "real" than stocks and futures.People are betting on the future value of some icos and the future use of digital coins. Commodities are the purest form of markets. That is until today. There is a lot of price manipulation still going on on crypto
571 2018-12-26 21:31:10 Stocks soar over 1000 points overnight....largest one day gain ever!
572 2018-12-26 21:31:00 Good day in the stock market. Definitely some buying opportunities. Hopefully we can get a couple days like this. #StockMarket #stocks #money
573 2018-12-26 21:30:54 It would be great if the SEC can look into his family’s stock transactions cause I’ll bet anything that they’ve been shorting stocks for some time now, knowing the actions their father is going to take. Can you say INSIDER TRADING!!!
574 2018-12-26 21:30:52 DJIA fluctuations, like weather fluctuations, are catnip for reporters. However, Khanna recanted that false claim. Apparently per the Federal Reserve Board 52% own stocks (though I thought it would be higher than that)
575 2018-12-26 21:30:42 Stocks surge!.... To where they were Friday at noon... Lol we've netted zero points gained in 2.5 trading days.
576 2018-12-26 21:30:37 STOCKS ROAR BACK
DOW +1,086
BIGGEST GAIN EVER

But of course the liberals and Democrats and media only say something when it goes down. They don't care about truth; they're just anti-Trump no matter what. They play politics and don't care AT ALL about facts.
577 2018-12-26 21:30:36 I guess we're not talking about stocks today
578 2018-12-26 21:30:33 Wow, I hit the jackpot of market timing, for one day at least, by shifting more into stocks on Monday.
Dow up +1,086.25 today
Looks like the January effect may be starting early this year. :)

582 2018-12-26 21:30:06 So.  Tax break, stock buy back, stocks grow, stocks sell. Stocks drop, then you buy more of them back with the same money, stocks bounce in biggest gain ever. Brilliant. 
Meanwhile deregulate, don't investigate.

589 2018-12-26 21:29:25 Largely Trump’s general idiocy, but rising interest rates combined with the trade war are real threats to equities. The higher interest rates go the more expensive even great stocks look so any threat to corporate profits, like a trade war, really impacts valuations.
590 2018-12-26 21:29:17 Don’t think of bear mkt as something horrible. Think of it as a large sale

(1) strongest holiday season in 7 years due to strong economy.
(2) record low unemployment
(3) great GDP growth
(4) great wage growth
(5) strong dollar
But somehow stocks are falling?

629 2018-12-26 21:24:02 Were you congratulatory two days ago? Of coarse people are going to buy because the stocks are cheaper. You can't base the economy on the stock market. You don't hear a word from the president when it slides. Only finger pointing.
630 2018-12-26 21:24:00 Agreed.  Now they can't use bump stocks for cover (camel's nose in the tent).  Trump & Republicans won't try to ban semiautomatics.
631 2018-12-26 21:23:42 Stocks way down the day before Christmas. Way, way up the day after Christmas. Nothing changed objectively. Before X-mas, pundits predicted Dow might drop another 20% in 2019. Now, pundits predict a rally in 2019. Classic hindsight bias. Stock market not good for mental health.
632 2018-12-26 21:23:39 @lookner I guess the CEOs got their Christmas bonuses and are buying back stocks.
633 2018-12-26 21:23:34 @lookner the stocks might be raising due to @realDonaldTrump visiting soldiers overseas.
634 2018-12-26 21:23:24 U.S. stocks staged a huge rally on Wednesday, posting their best day since 2009. The S&P 500 climbed 5%, while the Dow jumped over 1,000 points. -- Bloomberg
635 2018-12-26 21:23:20 U.S. stocks rebounded from the brink of a bear market, with the S&P 500 up almost 5 percent after weeks of losses. -- NYTimes
636 2018-12-26 21:23:19 When stocks sell off investors go to treasury bonds to buy. When price of bond goes up interest rates go down. Thats what the stock market was just trying to do to the feds. Force them to stop the rate hike. I think what they’re doing is a direct threat to our economy from within

638 2018-12-26 21:23:11 This is why I don't short individual stocks - even for companies that are begging for it. If one needs any further proof that there is zero thoughtfulness and rationality to this market, look no further than the swings in the last two trading days.
639 2018-12-26 21:23:08 Forever wishing I knew how stocks and shares work 
640 2018-12-26 21:23:06 Is the Santa Claus Rally on? After the worst Christmas Eve ever, stocks had their best December 26 ever, putting the S&P 500 up 2% through the first 2 days of the traditional Santa Claus Rally period. Still 5 more sessions to go.
641 2018-12-26 21:22:57 More like why tf do these people still play on 2 stocks
642 2018-12-26 21:22:31 The Dow is up so high that it can’t even fit the entire thing on the stocks app
643 2018-12-26 21:22:09 I deleted my reply. I didnt finish reading. I'm sorry for you. My sis is going through the same thing, with zero savings to lose gambling in stocks.
644 2018-12-26 21:22:03 The S&P 500 was up 5% today. Here are some of the stocks that led the way:

645 2018-12-26 21:21:53 HISTORIC DAY: Stocks Jump 1,084+ POINTS in Biggest ‘Single-Day Gain’ in US History
646 2018-12-26 21:21:35 U.S. stocks close far higher on Wednesday 12/26/18 $DJIA +4.98% at 22,878.45, $SPX +4.96% at 2,467.70, $COMPQ +5.84% at 6,554.35, $RUT +2.92% at $1329.81.
647 2018-12-26 21:21:35 When the democratics wanted to do it. As part of a much larger bill.

Trump doing it, in isolation,  deprived the democratics of using bump stocks as cover for their "assault weapons" bill
648 2018-12-26 21:21:26 Yesterday:  Trump says "great time to buy stocks".

Today:  market up 5% in one day.

So much WIN!!
649 2018-12-26 21:21:17 The Stock Market Tanked because the Fed keeps raising Interest Rates when there is no need. Also, Stocks/Indicies move on speculation, good or bad too. It’s not all about Economic Conditions. The only economical issue that is  is your government spending. Control Yourself!
650 2018-12-26 21:20:55 Mr. T, could you just stay in Iraq and not come back for a while, stocks are up since you left #stocksrally #nasdaq #potusaway
651 2018-12-26 21:20:51 Closed up 1086.25. Buy Hemp stocks. I made the median household annual income today.
652 2018-12-26 21:20:47 I have beed receiving notifications that all the irrelevant stocks are up 5% at the same time? Harley davidson and Kimco realty? This is a joke.
653 2018-12-26 21:20:38 So now they saying it's the best it's ever been after yesterday was the worst it's ever been . Sounds like bs to me . If your investing into stocks cause they say so your not the bright .

656 2018-12-26 21:20:18 @Activision can you let @Blizzard_Ent do their stuff like @Disney do with @DisneyPixar ? Thank you. By the way, nice drop on Blizzard stocks.
657 2018-12-26 21:20:17 About 50% of Americans have some investments in stocks including retirement funds
658 2018-12-26 21:20:13 But also probably one of the only S&P stocks that is up in the last month
659 2018-12-26 21:20:11 On the contraay always a reason why a stock is “worth” 172x earnings etc - for years.  Bears don’t need a reason when stocks are too expensive!
660 2018-12-26 21:20:09 NEW YORK (AP) -- Dow closes up than 1,000 points in best day for Wall Street in 10 years as stocks rally back from Christmas Eve beating.
661 2018-12-26 21:20:07 Stock Market prices do NOT EQUAL the Economy in USA.  Good economy & good biz earning don't mean upward movement on stock prices when value realization occurs & stocks R massively overpriced, up to multiple fold.  Bad stock fundamentals, but not bad economy or biz  fundamentals.
662 2018-12-26 21:20:07 Global stocks and oil rebound after pre-holiday thumping
663 2018-12-26 21:20:05 Markets tells stocks how to move; stocks tells Markets how to curve.
664 2018-12-26 21:20:02 Where is the Fake-news on the stock market performance, today... with the market up over 1000 points... so anxious to speak about some negative 'record' they dream-up when the market tanks... wasn't a 'record' broken today?  -After, Trump recommending a 'buy' for stocks!
665 2018-12-26 21:20:02 @petrogustavo Wachu, eres tu? Stocks = acciones. El tweet original se refiere al precio de la acciones que se acerca a estar igual que cuando trump inicio (cero ganancia). No es pecado no saber inglés, pero es increíble desviar el mensaje a su acomodo excusado en eso.
666 2018-12-26 21:19:55 CNBC Bulshit - persuading people to continue buying stocks on the stock  market, and the best they took even more credit - the stock lever

670 2018-12-26 21:19:27 Dow surges more than 1,000 pts
U.S. stocks rocketed up today, with the DJ industrial average soaring about 5%, or 1,086 pts.
The dramatic surge, which erased losses from Wall St’s worst Christmas Eve ever, also played out on S&P 500, which climbed about 5%, & Nasdaq, up 5.8%.
671 2018-12-26 21:19:24 What has been happening in E&Ps is now true for S&Ps. Market will trade at historically low multiples.

Growth > earnings for market, low discount rate not enough.

Massive debt in US, EU, Japan&China + ageing demographics, paint a bleak picture for stocks.
672 2018-12-26 21:19:19 Incredibly ridiculous. You tipped stocks in your papers only to sell them pa the next day!!!!
673 2018-12-26 21:19:07 So everyone had fun today, everything is ok they said. #stocks #investing
674 2018-12-26 21:19:07 @ChartTrade not all stocks are created equal. And too bad there are way better companies out there. Such as Amzn
675 2018-12-26 21:19:03 The Dow closes up 1,086 points to end at 22,878.  It was the best day for Wall Street in 10 years as stocks rally back from December plummet.
676 2018-12-26 21:18:58 Newsflash, congressional salary isn't remarkably high by any first-world standards. A wealthy congressmen has stocks, donations, and business connects that go right back to the source of the problem.
677 2018-12-26 21:18:57 Well Kohli came from the same ranji trophy fc system.... Wonder what they will say about that!! Not to mention how far India's bowling stocks are coming along. Clowns!!
678 2018-12-26 21:18:49 Santa rally on the market today, finally! Dow up 1086. In other news, the orange idiot hasn’t tweeted all day while finally visiting troops. Silence from trump, stocks rally...
679 2018-12-26 21:18:24 Wow! Trump leaves the country and stocks surge to gain over 1000 points. Can we extend the stay?
680 2018-12-26 21:18:23 Had Calls on several stocks I thought were going to heaven, could be a good day today 
681 2018-12-26 21:18:14 Are we sure this isn't just because billionaire friends of Individual 1 buying up cheap stocks that fell over the last week or so?
682 2018-12-26 21:18:11 @ChrisCuomo looks like stocks are up 1000...I don’t hear you saying anything good cuomo...you’re such a N.Y. HYPOCRITE A- hole...
683 2018-12-26 21:17:47 Oh now when vultures fly in and buy cheap stocks it’s a miracle ???
684 2018-12-26 21:17:45 you do know that your beloved Trump rolled out a fed reg officially banning bump stocks, right?!  Not only that, if you already own one, you have less than 90 days to turn it in/destroy it! How'd that taste?
Suckers!
685 2018-12-26 21:17:41 My conspiracy theory goes as follows.  Mnuchin and 45 shorted stocks last week, then announced a possible firing of the Fed Sec, and are now making a profit on today's rise.
686 2018-12-26 21:17:40 Can someone draw a graph of how high the stocks go when trump leaves the country or doesn't tweet
687 2018-12-26 21:17:34 Dow closes up more than 1,000 points in best day for Wall Street in 10 years as stocks rally back from Christmas Eve beating @wbz #wbz
688 2018-12-26 21:17:20 I like both answers! lol. Stocks started falling when dems won house back? Fed Reserve trying to save face in the "Deep State Operation Take-Down @realDonaldTrump" Plan D? E? F-ail?
689 2018-12-26 21:17:07 Considering how much it had loss in recent days, weeks, months...this isn't terribly surprising. Once Trump gets back on US soil and is tweeting, this 1000 will probably be wiped out by Friday. 

The large fluctuations should be a cause for concern for all those with $ in stocks.
690 2018-12-26 21:17:04 Wooooo, the #SantaRally is real baby! I haven't earned all my gains from 2018 back, but I'll take what I can get (still in the black). I hope this isn't a one off and reverses tomorrow. #stocks #stockmarket $MSFT FTW +6.83%
691 2018-12-26 21:16:54 Mostly retail stocks went up because of spending at Christmas will see

DOW +1,086
BIGGEST GAIN EVER

Any comment? #SchumerShutdown
693 2018-12-26 21:16:51 Monday stocks plunged. Today’s stocks rose. Holiday shopping on credit seems to have performed quite a trick.  But here’s a hint @business @WSJ , 90% of Americans are not on “solid footing.” And neither is the stock market.
694 2018-12-26 21:16:46 Je parle spécifiquement du gallium, après les métaux issus de la terre rare ou autre c'est un autre souci c'est clair, puis bon il faut aussi gérer les stocks de chinois qui creusent

699 2018-12-26 21:15:55 Remind them the stock market was proclaimed dead 100X more than Bitcoin, and this year is no exception. Then ask them if they're still gonna invest in stocks..
700 2018-12-26 21:15:54 Suspect? Yesterday #Trump said good time to buy stocks. Obviously he knew something. Was #PPT at play @CNBCClosingBell??? Sure would make sense given the #DowUp1000. #SmellsFishy... #WednesdayMotivation

728 2018-12-26 21:13:25 Many people did'nt know when Trump was young he had a lemonade stand! Trump found his purpose in life. Many assumed he was referring to buisness, real estate, stocks, no Trump was a failure at all of those. It was his kool-aid it was so powerful they would follow him anywhere.
729 2018-12-26 21:13:19 U.S. stocks staged one of the biggest rallies of the 9 1/2 year bull market after coming withing points of seeing it end, Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped more than 1,050 points and the Nasdaq 100 rallied 6 percent. Each gain was the best since 2009.

738 2018-12-26 21:12:36 World stocks ex US little changed, US soars 5%. Buyers stormed oversold market. Solid GDP + eps-growth overwhelms fear of tariffs & government dysfunction for at least 1 day. Economic realty has been lost in noise & fear. No guarantee Trump won’t rekindle fear & tank market.
739 2018-12-26 21:12:31 Ultra Islamic share holders of social media stocks are meddling in what content is allowed either directly or indirectly. This should be forbidden BY LAW to preserve, freedom of thought, speech and democracy.
740 2018-12-26 21:12:20 None of this will mean much to most Americans. Rich assholes keep making $$ off stocks & other mechanisms they've set up for themselves. Headlines keep blaring nonsense one way or the other while Trump bullshits his way into swindling still more for his crime syndicate.

751 2018-12-26 21:11:21 I do. Banning bump stocks and him/Kushner pushing forward for prison reform. Just because I don’t like him as a president doesn’t mean I hate everything he’s done. The bad just outweighs the good for me.
752 2018-12-26 21:11:20 Purchased a few stocks on Christmas Eve and they're up 12% in one day
753 2018-12-26 21:11:14 They have no clue about stocks trading and AI screwing up the stock market!
754 2018-12-26 21:11:05 Buy when stocks are low & sell when high. Not rocket science.
755 2018-12-26 21:10:45 Bump stocks weren't the hill to die on. And @PressSec making the announcement of the ban blew up certain narratives nicely.
756 2018-12-26 21:10:39 great day to reposition stocks into more gold and silver stocks.  Bought some $PYPL and $MSFT this morning and enjoyed the over sold bounce, looking to sell again soon.

759 2018-12-26 21:10:26 Record breaking day for Dow Jones. Up over 1.000 points almost 5% and Nasdaq up almost 6%. Extreme oversold market scenario caused this rally on Boxing Day. S&P P/E ratio only at 13.6%.  38% of stocks on US S&P500 at 52 week low. Amazon up almost 10% today. Apple up 7%.
760 2018-12-26 21:10:17 Well, stocks were down 20% from the highs of this year, but we did have a nice bounce today. Was it a dead cat bounce or Trump leaving the country?
761 2018-12-26 21:10:04 If you own #stocks, run home and look at your investments. Today maybe the best day to look at it in the next few months. There is so much market volatility, you should expect similar moves downward. For today, enjoy the results
762 2018-12-26 21:09:59 Ohhh nooooo stocks go up and down! Wow who knew?
763 2018-12-26 21:09:57 Breaking News: #BoxingDay good news for stocks. Instant replay? Yes, please! #StockMarket #PoliticsToday
764 2018-12-26 21:09:54 Dow ends more than 1,000 points higher as stocks rebound from Christmas Eve rout
765 2018-12-26 21:09:34 Stocks: they go up. They go down. But what if they don’t? Subscribe to my free email newsletter for more groundbreaking analysis.
766 2018-12-26 21:09:33 Must be consistent to warn Wednesday volatility in #stocks is too great to EXPECT a rally to sustain - that is, at least not without "backing and filling." Big losses on Thursday may NOT be "backing and filling." Solid followthrough would be "great," implying "beating the odds."
767 2018-12-26 21:09:30 Good to see everyone used their Christmas money to buy stocks
768 2018-12-26 21:09:15 #stocks have now entered the bulltrap phase, and #crypto is pulling back to test support. Nothing to worry about, this is perfectly normal. Just keep your eyes on the bigger picture.
769 2018-12-26 21:09:09 Stocks and crypto is a matter of patience. Those that are the most patient will succeed.
770 2018-12-26 21:09:07 So a year from now, will stocks be:
a) within 2% of where they are now
b) higher
c) lower
771 2018-12-26 21:08:30 Maybe Tomorrow also Europe stocks Will bounce
772 2018-12-26 21:08:28 Breaking: Dow closes up more than 1,000 points as stocks rally back from Christmas Eve beating
773 2018-12-26 21:08:21 Stocks stage manic rally after Xmas Eve plunge as buyers flood back in. Dow ends +1,086, +5.0% to 22,878 -- back to where it was early last Fri.

Nasdaq +5.8%, S&P 500 +5.0.

Crude oil also rebounds, +9.9% to $46.75.

So it's "risk on" again -- but for how long?
774 2018-12-26 21:08:20 I see Donnie's little friends are buying stocks again.

780 2018-12-26 21:07:07 I said stocks could fall 20% without a recession. Let's say close enough.

784 2018-12-26 21:06:42 Stocks have best day since 2009.  Literally, one quarter of the market decline was erased in one day. It usually doesn’t happen that way. Thank you Santa.
785 2018-12-26 21:06:35 Yesterday I put in an order to rebalance a bunch of my 401k away from stocks in anticipation of a rough 2019.  Which I meant to do weeks ago but forgot .  Pure luck to catch that bounce.
786 2018-12-26 21:06:32 Sometime things that the market didn't do is more important than the things it did do.  Today, many stocks and indexes did not fade.  They held and closed near their HOD. $SPX $NDX $RUT $ES_F $NQ_F $RTY_F
787 2018-12-26 21:06:19 A challenge for this thesis is that it is the defensive plays that tend to cause defensive sector stocks to remain held up and once conditions improve people take money out of them: examples are utility stocks, automobile car parts, gold etc.
788 2018-12-26 21:06:11 Why did stocks rally 1,086 points today?
Why did stocks fall 650 points Christmas Eve?
Nothing’s changed

795 2018-12-26 21:05:52 @jimcramer Booyah Jim and thanks for teaching us not to panic sell if the fundamentals of the stocks we own are good. I would have missed today’s rebound.
796 2018-12-26 21:05:51 Dow was ashamed from Christmas stocks collapse .
797 2018-12-26 21:05:48 Stocks then declined 30% over following 6 months
798 2018-12-26 21:05:42 @SusanLiTV give me a gift in the spirit of Christmas-I need a job-a house-and a bank account with good money-or just give me stocks in my stockings.
799 2018-12-26 21:05:39 I guess when @realDonaldTrump tells you to buy stocks you better listen

805 2018-12-26 21:05:14 Miami Hurricanes ring the bell of the NYSE. Stocks up over 1000 points today, biggest one day gain ever......coincidence? I think not
806 2018-12-26 21:05:12 Maybe I'm just overly cynical.  Yes, I love an up day for the market.  Yes there are factors that would cause that.  But it's one day. And it's a low volume day when a coordinated effort by high power investors could be influential.  #stocks

826 2018-12-26 21:03:45 After years of telling people to avoid the cigarette stocks (which were trading at 18-25x P/Es), I finally think the two biggest are buys today. Slightly favor $PM over $MO because the former benefits from a weaker USD over time.
827 2018-12-26 21:03:36 stocks added billions today... meanwhile the king shitcoin can’t even go up. if crypto is an asset class, it’s like a drop of a water in an ocean right now. crappy outlook

834 2018-12-26 21:03:14 It's all sunshine and rainbows in this fake stockmarket rally today. 64 billion dollars appear out of nowhere to buy stocks after government intervention to save the elites or rather opening exit doors for them.... That's how you know the entire system is just one big fat lie.
835 2018-12-26 21:03:11 Stocks rally day after #Christmas 
I'm sure the #FederalReserve is thinking about a third interest rate hike for 2019 now.
Any bets?
836 2018-12-26 21:03:10 Biggest point gain in DJIA history as strong rally sweeps stocks. DJIA + 1,086 (5%) in first-ever 4-digit gain, erasing Monday's 3% loss. 2018 is still in the red, but end of the world has been postponed - again.
837 2018-12-26 21:03:08 US stocks up 5% post Xmas (in 1 day), but Japan down 5% yesterday. This is extreme volatility & anyone in the investment game will tell you 5% 1-day moves are significant.

I don't know how they get some of these people on there. One woman today was saying retail stocks will probably get hit because of a slowing economy. IS SHE SERIOUS? They have already priced in Armageddon.
862 2018-12-26 20:58:51 One day isn't going to cut it with the energy stocks though. But if they string together 3 or 4 solid days, then we're talking.
863 2018-12-26 20:58:25 I‘ve heard they will get out of stocks as well, because the market dipped.

875 2018-12-26 20:56:00 #Stocks,#Indexes Ignore that reference to "strength" in "strength-duration" earlier.  Models signal DURATION, not magnitude (unfortunately).  Accordingly, the current rally has, AT MOST, 3 days to run (to a signaled top, we presume).

896 2018-12-26 20:51:38 don't read too much into the stock market rally. It is quite normal It has more to do with bottom feeders and bargain hunters salivating over the lure of cheap stocks not anything Trump has done.
897 2018-12-26 20:51:24 the last time stocks soared this much the US was downgraded
898 2018-12-26 20:51:08 We need to stop using the stock market as a measure of economic health.  Most people don't own stocks, and it's a system that in my opinion has a very dark downside that no one ever talks about.
899 2018-12-26 20:50:52 .@msnbc the Dow is up due to those “buys” because smart investors always buy when stocks are way down....bigger bang for your buck. It’s not rocket science or a head scratching wonder.

915 2018-12-26 20:47:16 Either equities are reassured that President Trump is not going to do  something he cant (fire the Fed Chairman) , or that rates are relatively low, or that a 3% US economy might not warrant a bear market, or that Santa had a good season. At any rate-- Stocks are higher.
916 2018-12-26 20:47:04 Real question and forget politics: if a President says people should buy stocks, is that not market manipulation?  Or is a President just considered another person voicing an opinion?

955 2018-12-26 20:38:16 The stocks probably did so well because he was in the air and couldn’t tweet.
956 2018-12-26 20:38:13 To professional investors, for they are the market, what Trump does or doesn't do has a nominal impact. Know how professional investors do what, how and why they do what they do and know how the markets function then you can better understand why stocks rise and fall.

963 2018-12-26 20:36:35 131. There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.
964 2018-12-26 20:36:32 Stocks plunged. Gave more time to review over holiday. Cheap stocks were available. Even I bought after wife freaked out Christmas Eve. Careful for that bounce though.
965 2018-12-26 20:36:29 Yesterday, everybody had too many stocks. Today, nobody has enough.
966 2018-12-26 20:36:14 Cool I'll look into it for new tax year, already got a stocks and shares isa iirc cant pay into two in a year I can't fuckin remember
967 2018-12-26 20:36:04 Plenty of traders that make 100k plus a year have done that though. Something is amiss either with the psychology behind trading or the system. Do you mind me asking what stocks you are in and where you went long or short?
968 2018-12-26 20:36:03 Stocks going up
969 2018-12-26 20:36:00 Wall street gyrations!!  Why?  I think all people like Soros have ito do is manipulate millions of stocks via surreptitious routs to manipulate the  economy measuring stick. Just another Democrap maneuver?

971 2018-12-26 20:34:33 #stocks $spx Trump leaves country (& stops tweeting) and market is up 3%. Imagine if he resigned! (Sorry DJT fans)

This could be mainly short squeeze but I think it’s valid correction of hugely oversold conditions and will continue into year end. I’m also very bullish for 2019.
972 2018-12-26 20:34:02 Buy me some stocks playboy
973 2018-12-26 20:33:59 Correct, but in combination with other asset markets they are very good indicators of the monetary stance - if the yield curve is inverting, stocks are down, commodity prices are down, the dollar is stronger and inflation expectations are down the signal would be very clear.

990 2018-12-26 20:28:20 Stocks up today?  Is that allowed?  Someone call Jay Powell and tell him to hike the rates again!
991 2018-12-26 20:27:36 me too. I don't flinch when the market goes down because some stocks are still earning enough in dividends to be better than a bank or bonds. worth investing in as long term. I did dump the mediocre value stocks over past 6 months & just kept more of the growth stocks.

1031 2018-12-26 20:16:30 Trump has cost most Americans to lose money every time the stocks go down so stop hating on people. Everybody loses.
1032 2018-12-26 20:15:51 No, the companies who spent most of the extra money earned from tax breaks on stock buybacks artificially inflated the prices due to the decreased supply of stocks and shares
1033 2018-12-26 20:15:38 @RobinhoodApp  Hey guys, look into a new feature that allows us to allocate capital into different stocks by percentage. Something similar to M1 Finance.

1036 2018-12-26 20:14:57 CNBC Bulshit - persuading people to continue buying stocks on the stock market, and the best they took even more credit - the stock lever
1037 2018-12-26 20:14:57 All because Mnuchin told the Plunge Prevention Team to buy stocks!
1038 2018-12-26 20:14:16 481 / 505 stocks in $SPX are green.
1039 2018-12-26 20:14:12 I was playing wolf, Samus, and corrin. I was bowser with 7 stocks on my belt but couldn't finish RIP
1040 2018-12-26 20:14:03 Saving face, saving money. Now that stocks have ticked up, he'll sell short, then tank the market again. He enjoys roiling the market and people's lives.
1041 2018-12-26 20:13:39 apple stocks rise by 30%.
1042 2018-12-26 20:13:36 Mr. Trump will claim his base acted on his "good time to buy stocks" pronouncement early in the a.m. -- but oversold conditions always spark nibblers. This could end badly for Mom & Pop. Or S&P is good basement value @ 14. Exhaustion either way.
1043 2018-12-26 20:13:36 Depends on your circumstances I suppose, I invest a lot in stocks and shares and I’ve moved a lot away from some American firms at the moment. But with every negative their is a positive I suppose.

1045 2018-12-26 20:13:10 Ppl just being merry for a couple of nights. Investor psych drives to buy stocks when happy, and sell when depressed
1046 2018-12-26 20:12:53 People are suffering all over this Planet.  Many of the World Powers do little to resolve this.  As long as the economic money train, stocks are flowing.
1047 2018-12-26 20:12:50 #Stocks,#Indexes Expected rally as described earlier and-- emphatically-- this is a rally in a LONG-TERM BEAR MARKET.  Long term, only SHORT positions are warranted, in keeping with major Model signals heretofore.
1048 2018-12-26 20:12:42 Joke around all ya want AFTER stocks close for the day :-)
1049 2018-12-26 20:12:42 Hey where the bears at today ? 

Sticking to my bullish call , everybody scared that bull market is over bla bla 

Yield curve not negative yet, GDP still easily over 2% for 2019 , consumer strong! 10 yr yield only 2.7%

S&P500 $SPY sees 2700 within next 90 days

1050 2018-12-26 20:12:26 It’s also greatly affected their sales outlook, which in stocks is even worse. Whether or not they publicly said anything about crypto helping their sales, it WAS helping their sales (many midrange cards going to mining, drying up the supply and allowing them to raise price).

1052 2018-12-26 20:10:56 What stocks did you buy today? 
#NASDAQ #DowJones
1053 2018-12-26 20:10:40 Crude up nearly 10%! This is causing energy stocks, and financials to be bid higher. I have outlined how this works for years! And now you see it in action.
1054 2018-12-26 20:10:36 Stocks are ‘close enough to a bottom’ for investors to step in: Guggenheim’s Minerd
1055 2018-12-26 20:09:17 #Stocks,#Indexes SPX,NDX bottom signal; SPX=2424;NDX=6148.
1056 2018-12-26 20:08:33 The Dow is on the rise, today. Why? Because rich people are buying the cheap stocks. The markets are legalized gambling. They are just as rigged as casino games.
1057 2018-12-26 20:08:17 I liken shorting stocks to setting the spinaker on a sail boat, either you have extreme confidence in your abilities or you've had too much to drink.
1058 2018-12-26 20:07:19 TY DJT for telling us to buy stocks.. awesome!!
1059 2018-12-26 20:06:49 Oh boy, if you have to Google it you got no business shorting stocks!
1060 2018-12-26 20:05:49 The Plunge Prevention Team is buying stocks. Meanwhile, Mnuchin, Ross, Icahn, Murdoch, and Kudlow prepare to sell the rip.
1061 2018-12-26 20:05:37 You are loved! Keep her! 
1062 2018-12-26 20:05:17 These suckers buying stocks right now are going to be so rekt.
1063 2018-12-26 20:05:04 Mr President. Can you trade the bump stocks for the hearing protection act?
1064 2018-12-26 20:04:51 Es una sandez absolutamente increíble de leer de parte de alguien que se precia de ser un economista. Se es feliz por tener sus stocks en cero en una economía de 400 millones de habitantes, aumenta la producción, se genera riqueza.
El mejor inventario es el dinero.
1065 2018-12-26 20:04:47 I want to know who is buying this market,,,who are the actual buyers.I don't have too many friends buying stocks lately,,,total fraud,,I can't stomach these morons on CNBC acting so giddy,,
1066 2018-12-26 20:04:42 I do not agree with taking away guns. But The bump stocks, which is the only ONE Trump supported. As I understand it, they turn non-machine guns into machine guns which illegal So if that is true, I do understand that. But not taking arms away. Bump stock is not a gun, right?
1067 2018-12-26 20:04:19 Most major companies experienced/ are experiencing a jump in the stocks over the holidays. Good time to make some moves before the quarter.
1068 2018-12-26 20:03:19 My stocks and investments are doing horrible. Are we winning yet? #annoyed #losingmoney #14monthdecline how much are you losing? — feeling pained
1069 2018-12-26 20:03:07 @realDonaldTrump trying to pull a @BarackObama and say it's a good time to buy stocks. Only difference, @BarackObama did it after a crash, not a little correction. $SPX $SPY $QQQ

1073 2018-12-26 20:01:36 El que haya un exceso de Stocks no implica que no los puedan vender!!!
1074 2018-12-26 20:01:22 What...are you losing money in stocks? Because thats the only thing you and prune face pelosi would be worried about. You sure arent worried about the country!
1075 2018-12-26 20:01:20 Stocks rally strongly on rising rates
1076 2018-12-26 20:01:17 I have love for legacy rags Wall Street Journal and Financial Times. But what if I ran an "investigative" piece on thousands of penny stocks, how scammy they were, and insinuated it's equivalent to the entire equities market? Losing your fastball guys. Sad!
1077 2018-12-26 20:01:09 And Mexico is paying for the WALL, tax cuts are resulting in booming economy in the form of stocks crash, federal workers are without pay on Xmas as one party rule of congress and President can’t pass a spending bill! Great!
1078 2018-12-26 20:00:36 Hablan stocks.  En serio consulte a Berny de donde se acuña el término.
1079 2018-12-26 20:00:30 3D Systems Corp (DDD) up 1.7454% 9.91 per share #stocks
1080 2018-12-26 20:00:02 ....and in thin holiday trading markets between now and Dec. 31st, the rally in $USD stocks can easily be another 5-7% to the upside by Monday night.  #explosive
1081 2018-12-26 19:59:29 I'm encouraging all equity investors to buy #xrp when you pull out of the equities market. It's going to be the new standard with thousands of investors, growing adoption, and stable technology. #XRPCommunity #xrpthestandard. Stocks are going to continue to fall is my prediction
1082 2018-12-26 19:59:26 My stocks say otherwise 
1083 2018-12-26 19:59:07 Dear I only have stocks!!!!

1086 2018-12-26 19:57:09 Very early to say for sure, but the truth is that stocks historically do very well in RISING INTEREST RATE environments.With the global bond market (3X+ the size of ALL equity market caps COMBINED) a bloated bubbly mess, the institutional allocations from bonds2stocks can be huge
1087 2018-12-26 19:57:08 Ehhhh lvl 9 CPUs aren't as hard as ppl make them out to be I just beat one with 2 stocks left
1088 2018-12-26 19:57:00 After four-day rout in US markets, stocks jump as much as 3 percent

1092 2018-12-26 19:56:00 Mr President. Could you trade the bump stocks for the hearing protection act?
1093 2018-12-26 19:55:51 It’s Time to buy stocks as chaos which is not to uncommon for new Socialist Dems are selling their stocks! American patriots are buying!  Woohoo !!!!!!
1094 2018-12-26 19:54:41 See through a drawn out investigation that continues to imprison officials for unrelated charges to the investigation of collusion because no matter how deep they dig they can't find a dang thing that Stocks? Yeah, I see through the hypocrisy because Obama did it on camera.
1095 2018-12-26 19:54:35 Stocks bouncing back today.
1096 2018-12-26 19:54:28 Yeah right, it’s the Fed that’s causing the Stocks to crash, not the three year old in the zonal Office.
1097 2018-12-26 19:54:07 “Stocks are currently in a _______ market”
1098 2018-12-26 19:53:52 @milhouser69 most likely a stock replacement. LEAPs are a safe way to replace stocks with options so your total capital exposure is lower.
1099 2018-12-26 19:53:36 Espiritu qliao de dr willy xD no le bajare la dificultad..... como ctm 9 stocks en un stamina battle  algun tip brocas? Tengo el espíritu que quita mas a los enemigos de metal, pero no puedo :( #SmashUltimate #WorldOfLight

1101 2018-12-26 19:53:09 I always ask my family if they have stocks in the light company cause our bills be wildin hahahhaa
1102 2018-12-26 19:53:00 No puedo creer que haya pensado que el mercado de "stocks" fuese de "inventarios".  
1103 2018-12-26 19:52:45 Conversely, 2017 was the BEST year for stocks in decades.  The market ebbs & flows. Anyone who's invested in the stock market knows this.
1104 2018-12-26 19:52:25 Y no ha dicho nada del desplome de los stocks en eua, jjajjjajajajajajajaja, no encontró minions en los estantes?? Ya q según el mega burro del Petro confunde la bolsa de valores con la bolsa de billetes, mejor dicho @petrogustavo la bolsa de balores pa q entienda
1105 2018-12-26 19:52:11 Stocks vs Sales
1106 2018-12-26 19:51:36 Who knows anywhere that stocks ducky one 2 mini keyboards? I’m tired of seeing “currently unavailable” 
1107 2018-12-26 19:51:27 Makes sense. When I used to wear my series 2 I'd use it mostly for fitness tracking, unlocking computer, checking stocks price. Nothing mission critical which made it easy to stop using.
1108 2018-12-26 19:51:15 Periodic Reminder: Stocks go up, not down, during "government" "shutdowns".
To own the libs.
1109 2018-12-26 19:50:39 Many years ago dad made all of our stocks for Christmas and one day I hope to do the same for my kids
1110 2018-12-26 19:50:18 It's a smart move? Stocks are way down and Muller is close and his criminal foundation is over, yeah it doesn't look suspicious at all
1111 2018-12-26 19:50:07 I think you've misunderstood. I'm asking whether you will stock Brixton hats in a size L? @ASOS currently only stocks sizes XS-M. Size L has never been available at ASOS– however this size is produced by Brixton. 
1112 2018-12-26 19:49:25 I'd like to hear him discuss it. and what he does invest in. I can understand why some people can't own stocks, either by company policy or by law (e.g. Chair of the NYSE, financial journalists such as those on CNBC, etc.), but not for someone like him.
1113 2018-12-26 19:49:05 I can barely keep my eyes open, but I'm still buying shares of stocks. My gains are quite good so far. I will keep buying until the close.
1114 2018-12-26 19:48:54 Stocks are on fire (today). Trump is clearly a genius.
1115 2018-12-26 19:48:52 I can barely keep my eyes open, but I'm still buying shares of stocks. My gains are quite good so far. I will keep buying until the close.
1116 2018-12-26 19:48:41 Apparently Santa had to park the sleigh before lifting and bidding this badly damaged #stockmarket. Boxing Day Dow stocks up over 3% include $NKE $AAPL $MSFT $HD and $V. Nike's actually up more than 5%. Volume not bad, considering the week. Big bounce so far.
1117 2018-12-26 19:48:29 Stocks in companies and crypto’s are very different! I know where I’d rather have my savings....
1118 2018-12-26 19:48:06 Stocks are up again :)
1119 2018-12-26 19:47:51 This ain't a rally for $stocks, this is just seller exhaustion.

The real rally is yet to come
1120 2018-12-26 19:47:42 It does seem that stocks will keep falling mid-long term, or not?
1121 2018-12-26 19:47:32 Happy holidays, sport. We got you a ban on bump-stocks as a Festivus present.
1122 2018-12-26 19:47:30 What did I tell everyone about the stocks? All Christmas gifts paid for in just a few hours lmao
1123 2018-12-26 19:47:28 No wonder stocks are jubilant. Maybe he'll stay over there!
1124 2018-12-26 19:47:13 The difference with this President is that every time the the stocks go up he is the first person to take credit for it. So he has definitely earned all the criticism people can can give him when the markets go down. Especially when they are record breaking declines.
1125 2018-12-26 19:47:02 it’s a good day:

1127 2018-12-26 19:46:18 Hey Ricardo, what cannabis stocks do you recommend and think have the most growth potential?
1128 2018-12-26 19:46:11 He’s taking the stocks into a downfall that there has never been such downturn since the Great Depression back in 1930’s
1129 2018-12-26 19:45:57 It’s amazing. If bitcoin guys applied their same mentality to stocks, they’d probably make good money over the long term
1130 2018-12-26 19:45:51 Shorting the casino stocks now.
1131 2018-12-26 19:45:30 Stocks are bouncing today because they were heavily oversold. Also, oil is printing a powerful bounce, currently up over 9%. Oil is rising after a report that there will be more xmas returns than ever this year. That is a boon for transports, thus an increase in oil demand.
1132 2018-12-26 19:45:08 I am sorry but I have to respectfully disagree over 75% of homeowners that I work with are POC that are predominantly in houses with price tags over $500,000. But you are correct you must by houses in areas that values increase more than others which is no different than stocks
1133 2018-12-26 19:45:00 Stocks and oil prices rebound. Strong x-mas season sales!
1134 2018-12-26 19:44:12 Such a joke.......... @potus could care less about the troops & everyone knows it.  It's another political stunt for him.   Children are dying at the border, because of Trump.  Stocks are in turmoil, because of Trump.  #ToddlerTrump should resign.
1135 2018-12-26 19:43:47 Did you buy stocks today or are you waiting for the next high?
1136 2018-12-26 19:43:36 what kind of jackass plays on 3 stocks 3 minutes
1137 2018-12-26 19:43:29 I fought someone and their rules was 2 stocks 3 minutes
1138 2018-12-26 19:43:10 I do it all. FUD, not-funny jokes, what-aboutisms. I'm short Tesla and long various oil stocks, but that doesn't mean Tesla isn't a fraud.
1139 2018-12-26 19:42:26 Trump just told you to buy stocks now that we are in a bear market — should you listen?   only idiots listen to liars
1140 2018-12-26 19:42:20 If we can boycott Fox News advertisers we can do the same to Japanese made goods and force pension and endowments to divest Japanese stocks.
1141 2018-12-26 19:42:18 I bet that was fun! I remember watching my mom and my uncle play a board game called Stocks and Bonds. Anyone else play that one? I was really young when they played it, maybe only around 8 or 9 years old so we're looking at the early 80's.
1142 2018-12-26 19:41:15 Which chart platform do you use to look at the JSE listed stocks..?
1143 2018-12-26 19:41:13 We had too. We have only one set left and those are family stocks. Hate him
1144 2018-12-26 19:40:59 FADE overplayed her hand today. Anybody with a brain knows this isn't real, as yet again they try to rally stocks & the USD while fading gold. Back to the woodshed.
1145 2018-12-26 19:40:47 Who is calling for the dollar the break higher in the next couple weeks? - even bulls seem to be calling for the opposite - but it has held up against collapsing everything - so if yields and stocks stop bleeding it may blast higher - spec longs have been exiting lately as well

1149 2018-12-26 19:40:32 With what f-ing money lost so much this year from our stocks. We took so far three good hits as in losing thousands each time over 10k this last one Friday I think we lost another 18k it’s bad this is our retirement he has passed away from us. We did sell all our stocks
1150 2018-12-26 19:40:14 Fair play to you mate....AIM too much of a basket case for me these days. Sold the last of my stocks earlier in the year. All about the sports now...
1151 2018-12-26 19:39:52 You do so much more your right. Lie nonstop just like trump. Tax cuts for rich good job. Obama's policies gave trump a gravey train presidency.  Now after hes screwed up what Obama policies created now stocks are tanking economic times slowing. Trump's a sleazy criminal con man.
1152 2018-12-26 19:39:49 Did the men in Nigeria beg for help for 13 hours?
I'm sure you've never mispronounced an unfamiliar name either.  
No different family policy from Obama's.  
My stocks are still higher than when BHO was there.  
Staff leaving is not new.  
You should pay closer attention.

1154 2018-12-26 19:39:00 I think every time trump tweets and stocks drop, all his rich cronies buy it up. Isn’t it illegal to manipulate the market for personal gain?
1155 2018-12-26 19:38:32 Strong indices today. A lot of growth #stocks show high gains. But wait for a proper setup. The #market tone can change within a second.

Let’s watch Rocky while we’re boxing
Fold my stocking, Fitbit’s clocking.”
1158 2018-12-26 19:36:25 Nope, as long as I can remember he said we are dancing with an eye on the exit and go all in short eu stocks and he was right
1159 2018-12-26 19:36:13 I was pretty sure rather than 28 it was closer than 22. But again that would depend also on where you live. Like I said. I own no stocks and really couldnt give a Damn.

1164 2018-12-26 19:33:33 Stocks are still the best non speculative passive income. The secret is to pick a company that is not popular/hip/trending (e.g Microsoft and Twitter a few years ago) while you identify a strong case for its future growth after going over its financial reports.
1165 2018-12-26 19:33:00 I think high quality energy stocks are at generational bottoms right here...commodities will be catching a huge bid next 10 years

1171 2018-12-26 19:31:45 The downturn has nothing to do with the midterms. It’s all about trumps tariffs. Stocks dropped recently because Wall Street is afraid China and the US won’t reach an agreement by a 3/1 deadline and Trump will raise tariffs 25% on everything China exports and they’ll do the same.
1172 2018-12-26 19:31:36 Exactly opposite of “shoe-shine boy asking you to buy stocks”!

Hope you had a marvellous Christmas CP & Santa replenished yours stocks of Artists materials. :)
1174 2018-12-26 19:30:17 With stocks on fire, makes sense.  Follow through in $Gold and $Silver depends on stocks.

1181 2018-12-26 19:26:59 I thought they only take stocks down so others can buy them cheaper 
1182 2018-12-26 19:26:21 If your argument is that people spent money on bump stocks so you can’t make them illegal. That doesn’t work. There is precedent for that. In a broad sense the biggest is probably emissions standards on cars. Standards change and your vehicle may not pass. Fireworks is another...
1183 2018-12-26 19:26:09 Dios Mío !! Urge que quienes creen que Petro es el estadista que necesita el pais acepten que es el mayor peligro que ha enfrentado Colombia... imagínense confundiendo stocks que son acciones con inventarios... no se sabe si reír o mejor llorar .... ABRAN LOS OJOS!
1184 2018-12-26 19:25:46 1/2
good point
Today's pump was apparently all buy-backs. 
If I read that correctly, these are instant loans for those buy-backs.
The corps doing the buying (of their own shares).
If the stocks continue the drop & the shares sell back at a loss, that liquidity can be 'retired'...
1185 2018-12-26 19:25:34 As a trader, i know its easy to talk.  If u want to brag about how smart u are forecasting stocks then show your trading account. Wheres your trades? My point is this.  Talk the Talk but make sure you can waLk the walk.
1186 2018-12-26 19:25:31 Closed out half those $AAPL calls from this morning. #stocks
1187 2018-12-26 19:25:26 $DJIA stocks up sharply today. Guess Big Bonus Daddy needs to pay for those Christmas gifts somehow.
1188 2018-12-26 19:25:21 Maybe those on Wall St. knew something and that's why stocks are rising... maybe they knew that trump was defecting... LOL
1189 2018-12-26 19:25:16 Sure. A grifting conman is suggesting you buy stocks, so you can watch them go down as the world economy slows and we head into a recession in the latter part of 2019. Trump is doing what he does best - screwing EVERYONE.
1190 2018-12-26 19:25:04 Im huge with investing . Black scared to take risk when all the money is within those stocks ! All they see is the negatives its sad. We could be rich af
1191 2018-12-26 19:23:22 Name one hate crime he has committed?
Btw- stocks have rebounded
1192 2018-12-26 19:23:09 Bertrand Russell (1872-1970) said... "The most valuable things in life are not measured in monetary terms. The really important things are not houses and lands, stocks and bonds, automobiles and real estate, but friendships, trust, confidence, empathy, mercy, love, and faith."
1193 2018-12-26 19:22:06 Ms Paquette
I JUST hear NPR hear and now spend 5 minutes on how to rebalance your portfolio, if you stocks have gone up to much

so people def have a point that media, even "liberal" media caters to the rich
this is objectively true
1194 2018-12-26 19:22:01 Look Donald isn't tweeting today. Is it because you're on the buy side in the market instead of shorting stocks?
1195 2018-12-26 19:21:34 @jimcramer Hey Jim, what happened to the bank stocks?  I bought a bank/financials ETF based on your glowing comments about the tax reduction and the wealth and investment that was expected. Right now the ETF is in the tank.....
1196 2018-12-26 19:21:24 I think this is mostly due to a combination of failing tech stocks & interest rate hikes. Time to audit the Fed & remind them of their place.
1197 2018-12-26 19:21:11 mina’s next ig post is gon be about starbucks and just watch as starbucks stocks rise
1198 2018-12-26 19:21:00 Don't miss out on this new Bull Market. Ride the tide!. Energy, Retail and Tech stocks - grab them up.
1199 2018-12-26 19:20:53 why are you picking on her ?
so stupid, esp considering the target rich environment

I JUST HEAR NPR , iirc hear and now, spend 10 minutes talking about how to rebalance  your portfolio if your stocks have gained to much

why don't you pick on the deserving ????
1200 2018-12-26 19:20:51 Don't miss out on this new Bull Market. Ride the tide!. Energy, Retail and Tech stocks - grab them up.
1201 2018-12-26 19:20:33 I’ve just always found them to be bland, fresh or stale. Just a personal taste.

1205 2018-12-26 19:19:55 This and how to short stocks using robinhood!!
1206 2018-12-26 19:19:54 Johan, I don't follow individual US stocks closely. AAPL seems very fairly valued, if not downright cheap, but that's about as much as I'll venture
1207 2018-12-26 19:19:52 Financial crisis of 2007-2009 was not a Great Depression, please. For the rest: Be happy stocks are on sale. I'm would like to get another 10% drop in S&P500.
1208 2018-12-26 19:19:47 So, health care is dangerous, but letting corporations and banks do anything they want is A-Okay. Cook your meat to well done and don't invest too much in stocks. You seem too naive to handle any of it thinking the rich are here for you.
1209 2018-12-26 19:19:46 Hablan del induce s&p y valor de stocks  que datos referentes al valor de las acciones en la bolsa. No de inventarios chavo alias el desinformador
1210 2018-12-26 19:19:44 Today is Boxing Day in Canada think I’ll open more dead stocks.
1211 2018-12-26 19:19:13 15 times $175 2019 SandP earnings is 2625. Sell off is definitely overdone. Can we mount a real comeback... going to take some time to tell. #stocks
1212 2018-12-26 19:19:03 Trump hasn’t tweeted today since he’s on his way to Afghanistan.  Stocks up over 575, so some truth to it.
1213 2018-12-26 19:18:48 You are replying to someone that 'shorts' stocks. AKA posts bad things hoping the stock will go down and he makes money. "shorters" Why America fails. The most unethical of stock traders.
1214 2018-12-26 19:18:35 $DPW is AMEX listed, what is minimum share price requirement? was looking for january poppers, stocks sold in december for tax losses, but is a reverse split in store? havn't seen any warnings from AMEX. ?
1215 2018-12-26 19:17:54 Stocks haven't crashed.
Mattis was leaving already
What happened to liberals call to bring our troops home.
Show me your outrage for the 18 kids who died under Obama while in custody.
Stay in reality
1216 2018-12-26 19:17:48 I'm hearing that stocks are on the  increase today.  Must be all those left over turkey carcasses.
1217 2018-12-26 19:17:26 Yes, certainly possible and would chime with lower low in stocks and perhaps Bond yields too before they ALL reverse hard.
1218 2018-12-26 19:17:24 Communication stocks looking good. Worth buying into, Verizon and AT&T.
1219 2018-12-26 19:17:13 Communication stocks looking good. Worth buying into, Verizon and AT&T.
1220 2018-12-26 19:17:11 Trying to Dodge a Bear Market in Stocks? It Might Be Too Late - Barron's:"BAREAZZ" GOT IT RIGHT, THEY ARE THE CAUSE OF THE STOCK MARKET CRASH ! THEY STOLE FROM   AMERICAN PEOPLE 'TIL THEY AIN'T NUTHIN' LEFT TO STEAL, FIRST JOBS, THEN "MADE IN THE USA" PRICES ON THEIR FOREIGN SHIT
1221 2018-12-26 19:16:41 I feel strongly that it is. At some level, the selloff in tech stocks feeds through to startups either directly (via the IPO window), or indirectly (companies have less "currency" to do deals) or indirectly via corporate efforts to cut costs and show profits.
1222 2018-12-26 19:16:23 Everyone enjoying their artificially pumped stocks today?
1223 2018-12-26 19:16:16 Oil surges again as stocks soar, today's $3+/bbl rise will eat into price declines... too early to tell if it's going to start a rally, but watching! #oil #oott
1224 2018-12-26 19:16:00 Yes we are and thank you! Stocks back up today without printing money! Thanks for not taking the Obama route to display FAKE stock increases.
1225 2018-12-26 19:16:00 And Doc R....I defended you REPEATEDLY. I've been crying all day trying to figure out what to do about the margin call, when I likely will lose the few stocks I have. I'm literally at the end of my rope.  Did you NEED 2 bring up politics, against group policies? Aggravated enough
1226 2018-12-26 19:15:20 You see plenty of fat stocks on leaners lifters tend to be lean and trim
1227 2018-12-26 19:15:00 wonder if this mentality is coming into focus because of the steep drop in tech stock prices (i.e. stocks up, “invest for growth”, stocks down “you need to turn a profit”)
1228 2018-12-26 19:14:43 Stocks are plunging due to the spiteful hikes the federal reserve (dirty globalists) is imposing. People aren’t quite as ignorant as you think, Chucky. We can indeed see what’s going on, and we don’t like it.
1229 2018-12-26 19:14:21 Trump is not tweeting, seems to be out of the country and the stocks are up......coincidence, market reactions?
1230 2018-12-26 19:14:19 #BreakingNews #Stocks rally #Dow UP 634 #NASDAQ up 235 #Oil UP $3.21 to $45.74 @KNX1070 @MottekOnMoney @KilduffReport @GasBuddyGuy $AAPL up $6.78 to $153.64
1231 2018-12-26 19:14:02 Nothing only goes up.  Always a bumpy ride even with the best stocks.  Oh and flippers gotta get their crumbs! We are looking very good today considering all the ticker change confusion and L2 not working correctly
1232 2018-12-26 19:13:46 Market crashed because of the internet stocks and the poor management of these progressive companies!
1233 2018-12-26 19:13:11 Hope you CASH our your stocks your 401K's

1238 2018-12-26 19:11:10 @PieFivePizza @PizzaInn_Inc @p5_franchising @KC_PieFive how many down days in a row?   Going for a record.  I remember a couple of stocks that traded like this.  Enron and worldcom.  At least there CEOs tried to defend.

1240 2018-12-26 19:10:48 For ex, Remember earlier in the year the DOW was over 1200 points down intraday - stocks were just going down 3% a min. That is the kind of capitulation that gets me willing to put a lot of money to work. Not saying we cant bounce here, but this kind of bottom today i can't catch
1241 2018-12-26 19:10:12 I want the government to be able to cut access to guns for known psychopaths like the terrorists that committed all those Mass shootings recently, yes. I want government to take away bump stocks, yes. In short: I want common sense gun laws.
1242 2018-12-26 19:09:54 Why not? The credit market will blow up in a few months, if the central banks don't reverse their course. Stocks could well anticipate that already.
1243 2018-12-26 19:09:33 Some stocks our traders are trading: $SPY $QQQ $C $IWM $XLF $TVIX
1244 2018-12-26 19:09:03 I know, that's why I'm following all foolish podcasts for years. Almost all of my US stocks have been chosen thanks to your advices. I would love if you could provide some investing ideas in EU/Switzerland once in while too. I think your international audience would appreciate.

1250 2018-12-26 19:06:26 Bet Trump got on the phone this morning to the Kochs, Mercers & whoever and just said please buy big today. Why not? Stocks so down they’re huge bargains.
1251 2018-12-26 19:05:57 Hopefully the stocks will be in the negative by closing the only people benefiting from the success of the stock market are the super wealthy billionaire/trillionaire class
1252 2018-12-26 19:05:42 Many people are such babies about taunting. I’ve had people get profusely angry irl if I taunt between stocks.

I just like hearing yoshis cute voice, but apparently people think a built in mechanic is bm.

1254 2018-12-26 19:05:31 #1.  Increase spending on lobbying legislators with campaign contributions.
#2. Increase spending on super pacs that attack legislators who don't support everything we want (ex: bump stocks).
#3. Increase the numbers of lobbyists in Congress.

1255 2018-12-26 19:05:27 If you wanna unlock characters quick go to smash mode set the stocks to 1 then do the random battle then the “a new challenger appears “ will pop up win that match then quit the game & start it again & repeat the process
1256 2018-12-26 19:05:16 The stock market is not the economy.

it reflects the sum total of investors' hopes, fears, prejudice and hubris about What Every Single New Thing Means.

Also after a big drop, prices are cheap and the Rich scoop up more discounted stocks.

Nice trick when you can afford it.
1257 2018-12-26 19:04:48 Actually, this is more like a classic barbell strategy @danielcrosby is doing.  Stocks for the long term and survival gear when it all falls apart.  
1258 2018-12-26 19:04:12 Most propitious @CNBC #BrianSullivan interview @ScottMinerd @GuggenheimPtnrs. 4-hike 2019 pivot to 50% 2019 #Fed ease. Makes up some for Monday's repeated #DavidTepper: "Buying some stocks" headline? Yeah sure, turn around selling?
1259 2018-12-26 19:03:40 It makes sense. This could be not just a rebound, but the end of the correction. So expect a switch from bonds into stocks. Bond yields higher = utilities down. They are defensive. Investors now will buy growth again (ndx).
1260 2018-12-26 19:03:07 I need to clarify my gif above. This is to illustrate the NRA members whining about outlawing bump stocks. It's not in support of them whining. It's critical of their whining. Yes, you heard right....whining.
1261 2018-12-26 19:02:45 You know, sold some investment stocks years ago way too soon for a quick profit. I’m hoping crypto is my 2nd chance! “Here’s to financial independence” 
1262 2018-12-26 19:02:24 Frankly we need stocks from actual labs. I once filmed a video to educate patients about clinical trials and the film directors did not believe an actual lab was attractive enough to film. They thought it should look more like CSI. That is many people’s understanding of science.
1263 2018-12-26 19:02:22 Because politicians don’t like to lose money. 

Why do you think they are allowed to trade stocks while in office?

1268 2018-12-26 19:00:45 if you haven't already, make sure you add some stocks to Netflix.
In a couple years i think they'll be completely independent with Netflix Originals.....their shows and movies only get better and better....
1269 2018-12-26 19:00:29 Best time to buy is when the market is down.  In fact, as twisted as it sounds, right after a company is caught doing something heinous & their stocks plummet & people are jumping ship, THAT's the time to buy (so long as you know the company will bounce back *cough* BP *cough*)
1270 2018-12-26 19:00:04 Short term bottom is highly likely, if we get a decent leg up I will be taking a number of growth stocks short.
1271 2018-12-26 18:58:15 All problems are solved... BUY those stocks damn you!

1273 2018-12-26 18:57:53 It’s what happens when retail investors/traders decide to go short. Someone told me today to short all pops. I laughed, I said stocks go up & down. He said this time was different. I asked how? No reply.
1274 2018-12-26 18:57:41 People are preparing for the Democrats to take control in January. We know the economy will decline once they are in control. I adjusted my investments from stocks to other funds. Many I know are doing the same in preparation.

1282 2018-12-26 18:55:31 Bump stocks are really pointless. I can trigger faster without one. The shooter in Vegas had full auto. Don’t believe the msm. Besides, when we get the rest of the constitution, it will be to how the founding fathers wrote it, not how it has been cut up over the years!
1283 2018-12-26 18:55:16 i just go company to company. i have only company views. I think it is pretty damn hard to guess if they S&P is going to have 7% EPS growth next year given geographic and sector mix. Better pick stocks.

1287 2018-12-26 18:53:10 These rough numbers frame up an even shorter runway

US Indv & Corporate savings(BEA #s) ~ 1.3 T

US Federal Deficit run rate through 2 months ~ 1.8 T

FED QT ~ 600 Billion

Meaning not enough savings to bid stocks with treasuries & QT running almost 2x savings.

1294 2018-12-26 18:52:20 i guess maybe we can all decide collectively that commenting on how much food someone is eating isn’t super fun?? maybe instead we can do things like “yum” or “the stocks are down”
1295 2018-12-26 18:52:00 Lol, this 1% meme needs to stop. Yeah. There's a small portion of elites, but upper middle class people are not part of the 1%. A lot of people own stocks. I have friends who make 45k a year invested in stocks. Not exactly billionaires.
1296 2018-12-26 18:51:32 I learned under Bush not to even look at stocks losses. Just hung on to them. Most went back up. I agree next two years will be brutal. We already have gone thru our budget and eliminated on all non-essentials (except the grandchildren).
1297 2018-12-26 18:51:17 Stocks rose in midday Wednesday trading, two days after the Standard & Poor's 500 teetered on the brink of bear territory....

1299 2018-12-26 18:50:54 @OpTic_BigTymeR Happy Holidays Will, I'm wondering if you have any tips or books that you have read about trading stocks  would you recommend? What's the key to get into stocks?

1305 2018-12-26 18:49:39 Quite possibly true! Bad for FAANG stocks, bad for America....
1306 2018-12-26 18:49:33 Day's Gain $3,612.03

Yes my gains dropped recently but if you hold good stocks a month ago, and nothing changes, you should be holding them today. The gains represent stocks regaining losses. I hold long term primarily.

1318 2018-12-26 18:45:15 Hi Terry, you are right - the broader market is not overvalued but the so-called momentum stocks are causing this short-term issues.  I see this as a healthy correction, and an opportunity to get into value plays once the dust settles down.

1328 2018-12-26 18:40:49 Yes very true. If you don’t like you can do other stocks that have cheap options and better delta instead of $AMZN

1330 2018-12-26 18:39:02 Yeah i don't think dair is that good but it can be used to bait and its decent for taking stocks, it just has way too much recovery time and you need both jumps if you want to get back from below stage
1331 2018-12-26 18:38:19 Really what about the cost  to all of the rebuilding bridges and roads projects as tariffs significantly increase the projects?. So great that we have to pay more and lose money in stocks.
1332 2018-12-26 18:38:16 People are not buying stocks they are buying socks and shoes.
1333 2018-12-26 18:37:59 The FED has 2 tricks. Raise/Lower interest rate, or PRINT money and buy into the stock market to increase  stock prices, this is called quantitative easing. Under Obama they lowered rates to ZERO %, and printed $4T and bought stocks, in an effort to “boost” the economy. #FakeEcon

1351 2018-12-26 18:33:26 The stocks are fucking up
1352 2018-12-26 18:33:12 C'est clair qu'on était loin des ruptures de stocks. Aux deux FNAC que je fréquentent elles étaient entassées devant l'entrée à la recherche d'âme charitables qui sont jamais venues.
1353 2018-12-26 18:32:54 where is the money that's lost when a manufactured stock market fall happens and are the democrats lining there pockets with American losses?   how many congressmen and women and senators are holding health care stocks and milking we the people?  ive seen people lose all savings.

1358 2018-12-26 18:31:22 know what's the pree for 2019? 

Stocks, and saving in USD.
1359 2018-12-26 18:31:14 1. been a while since a 20% correction. P/E of S&P of 2019 earnings roughly 13-14. 2. Comparative growth over past periods acceptable level = non stagnant. Meaning that stocks are a bargain. Don't see any other investments for bang/buck. 3. Ppl should take a chill pill...

1366 2018-12-26 18:29:02 Would be intrstng to knw your back testing results for which stocks on which to write strangles on... I generally start of writing deep OTM calls on individual stocks and then depending on movement of stock might make it a short strangle..
1367 2018-12-26 18:28:54 What are you talking about? Obama didnt ban bump stocks 
1368 2018-12-26 18:28:34 Bargains for the taking in the energy stocks, tech and communication stocks. BUY!!!
1369 2018-12-26 18:27:55 Another ridiculous tweet brought to you by the whiner in chief. We wonder why there's volatility in the stocks market. 
1370 2018-12-26 18:27:49 While I agree with you, it's my duty to report that numerous stocks are stunned to learn that they don't have feelings.
1371 2018-12-26 18:27:42 Trump telling people to buy stocks is a big deal. He wouldn't say that if he were about the tank the market with no China deal.
1372 2018-12-26 18:26:57 For once beg to differ. Mnuchin’s bank call highlights something very important - current drop in SPX differs very much from Lehman. This is asset manager crisis not bank crisis. Much lower feedback loop to real economy. Trump is right, stocks are a buy here
1373 2018-12-26 18:26:38 Bit weird that the stocks were all time high when R had the house, now the D have the house and the market is in the shitter.
1374 2018-12-26 18:25:50 Kass, can u just shut up. You said to short the S&P essentially every week since late 2009, you cover two months ago, buy all the bank stocks and add all the way down and you're giving advice?? Get a freaking life
1375 2018-12-26 18:25:26 Good invest in stocks or something black man 
1376 2018-12-26 18:24:12 There are so few Stocks which are good to write Strangles on. I was doing it mainly on the 2 Indices.
1377 2018-12-26 18:24:11 All depends on your dollar view. And à bit on you US stocks view.
1378 2018-12-26 18:23:20 1. Identify stocks past performance and if it's currently bullish or bearish

2. Find resistance/support levels

3. If bullish buy a call, bearish you want a put. Always buy with more than enough time to hedge risk.

4. If looking for shorter term trading, theory still applies.
1379 2018-12-26 18:22:52 If we are going to just think about this intuitively instead of running the numbers, then we noticed stocks only start the downward slide over the last few months. Bitcoin has been on a downward trajectory the whole year. That should put some doubt in your mind about correlation.

1384 2018-12-26 18:20:01 I wish @cnn had one economist that knew almost every December stocks fall as people sell off stocks for tax purposes.  Instead they use as part of their negative narrative.  I suspect in January when the markets rise they will ignore the results.

1390 2018-12-26 18:18:20 Could Trump be artificially influencing the market downwards so his rich cronies can buy in good stocks at a discount price? Is there a regulatory body looking at this?

1395 2018-12-26 18:16:57 It's exactly spot-on. The reason why this ban didn't result in an overall decline in gun violence is because the NRA lobbied to loosen restrictions on bump stocks and high-capacity semi-automatic guns like the AR-15. Mass shooters just changed their weapon of choice.

1415 2018-12-26 18:11:14 It's not that we're getting carried away because we're top of the league. It's the fact that less than two years ago our defence was probably one of the biggest laughing stocks in Europe.

1419 2018-12-26 18:10:00 Only the DUMMIES will buy any dips! The SMART MONEY will SELL the RALLY!!! MUCH BIGGER LOSSES ARE COMING!!!! 2019 will be a DOWN YEAR FOR STOCKS!!!
1420 2018-12-26 18:09:55 Me, terrible at Smash, instantly losing all my stocks and pounding my tiny fists on the coffee table: AIR COMBOS ARE GOOD AND FUN. I'M STUPID AND I LIKE THEM A LOT
1421 2018-12-26 18:09:51 Will you be stocking size L in any of the Brixton products? At the moment @ASOS only stocks size XS, S, and M.
1422 2018-12-26 18:09:33 thx @charliebilello Great reminder. Stocks can go down a lot with no recession. #BakesTakes_
1423 2018-12-26 18:09:03 That mad feeling when you lose money in stocks =(
1424 2018-12-26 18:09:02 So after Trump Finagles around with our markets ,stocks , trade agreements and boasts how well the economy is doing under his tutelagejust as I suspected , it’s looking like possibly a bear economy is about to creep up on us #thanksTrump #thanksGOP #yallaremessy
1425 2018-12-26 18:08:45 #Stocks haven't closed, so Wednesday's gains are not "in the bank." Since Dec. 3, rallies have been intraday and/or one-day events. If solid closes are posted on Wed AND similar gains are seen on Thursday, even in a holiday environment, it would be a change in pattern. (more)
1426 2018-12-26 18:08:37 Stocks can finally go up after long holiday newspaper research and good ole fashioned reasoning with friends and family to buy some stocks of companies. The type of buying that ramped this market for 8 years straight.
1427 2018-12-26 18:08:28 Explain to me why Mnuchin made that call when no one was worried about banks. He would make a huge fortune if he had shorted those stocks or stock market indexes, then made the call. Provide an explanation that makes sense other than this one.
1428 2018-12-26 18:08:05 Both as a TRUMP supporter and a savvy investor,  I would say now is a good time to start buying stocks “on sale”. Maybe spread it out a bit as stocks may still go up and down a bit, it’s difficult to catch the exact bottom.
1429 2018-12-26 18:08:04 I’m short investment grade credit at the moment. Not wavering until $HYG closes above $82. I don’t like stocks or bonds here. Bought $GOLD today before their annual divvy tomorrow of 240bps.
1430 2018-12-26 18:08:00 And you'll be there to help them just like you did with the NFA, GCA, Hughes Amendment, numerous import bans, NICS, FixNICS, and bump stocks. #NegotiatingRightsAway
1431 2018-12-26 18:07:44 Bounces are to be expected during a down trending/bear market. Watch for those stocks that gain during the rallies and give back little on the next decline. $TEAM
1432 2018-12-26 18:07:17 Yes sir, agreed. Not getting too aggressive on the long side because I'm still very bearish overall. Thinking re-connects with the 20/50d MA's will be great short re-entry points for most sectors/stocks.
1433 2018-12-26 18:06:12 "Get out of stocks and bonds, collect physical assets that can be traded" - the last time I asked this question .
1434 2018-12-26 18:06:07 Omg! You had 8 yrs Barry and didn’t do anything other than turn blacks on cops and bring back racism in a new , very ugly way. Trump banned bump stocks. You wouldn’t even do that! You did nothing but line your pockets and use the Presidency to push an un-American agenda. Go home!
1435 2018-12-26 18:06:02 Ca va c'est pas du 2 stocks non plus. 
1436 2018-12-26 18:05:56 our growth on a business front as exemplified by the fact stocks increased 3% the day he was sacked. But fair enough..: at least ur not one of those mourinho apologists who think he should have Kept that job
1437 2018-12-26 18:05:46 Stocks bouncing back. Wonder what the Dems will do or say to ruin the rally.
1438 2018-12-26 18:05:39 I trade stocks using charts (technical analysis). 

I buy stocks that are:

- On phase 2
- 52 week high
- All time high
- Overbought stocks
- Breaking above their 200 day moving average

Once a stock close below its 50 day moving average I sell it, even for a loss.
1439 2018-12-26 18:05:07 I can’t think of any reason not to buy stocks can you? I mean everything is going really great
1440 2018-12-26 18:04:51 @realDonaldTrump Please don’t tweet for the next few days weeks months years. I’ve lost way too much money because of stocks
1441 2018-12-26 18:04:51 No time for charting midday today, between family/friends/holiday continuation & some work from the day job, too slammed today. I do see on my trading charts support/resistance lines now being tested $VIX & some of the $SPX $NDX stocks 4-hour charts. Watching if holds or not.
1442 2018-12-26 18:03:52 So some stocks are up today. Ha I guess people wasted no time with their Xmas money lol.
1443 2018-12-26 18:03:42 Conveniently low stocks for his blind trust to buy.  He drove the markets down.
1444 2018-12-26 18:03:32 Once in a lifetime opportunity to buy into #Stocks #Dow #Nas #SPY. Go Rally!
1445 2018-12-26 18:03:10 Next year I will be in a position where I can trade Netflix, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, Disney, and other major companies stocks without batting an eye.
1446 2018-12-26 18:02:45 The recent stock market down turn explained: people sold off stock to buy Christmas presents.  Now that Christmas is over, people are rebuying their stocks...
1447 2018-12-26 18:02:37 The Stocks & Investing realm is actually pretty fun and interesting
1448 2018-12-26 18:02:27 FYI who makes money when Stocks plummet… And then they buy it back at next to nothing it’s only money mixing around with the billionaires

1450 2018-12-26 18:01:09 .@AliVelshi why are stocks rising today?
1451 2018-12-26 18:01:05 From CNN:

"Stocks have fallen too far out in front of the real economy," said Chris Rupkey, managing director of MUFG. "I suspect there may be less human being trades selling stocks here, than there are just mindless computer-driven trades following the latest trend."
1452 2018-12-26 18:01:03 Our volumes are high so it it cheaper to print in house, we have control over quality and can print on demand which eliminates the need to keep large stocks on hand. This helps when we update product, we can have new printed materials available immediately.
1453 2018-12-26 18:00:51 You can pick your stocks. You can pick your nose. But you can't pick your stocks nose. Or can you? Who nose... BTW, is 1PM too late to get into the wine?
1454 2018-12-26 18:00:17 No one has any confidence the DJ will get better but some stocks are considered cheap now so buying those stocks pushes up the DJ. It's called a dead cat bounce. Even if a cat is dead, when you throw it from the roof it still bounces up. Thanks #Trump

1459 2018-12-26 17:58:53 Thanks for posting something that proves my point. The ban was effective in reducing automatic assault rifle violence, but gun violence did not decrease overall because of the proliferation of high capacity clips, grandfathered weapons and new attachments like bump stocks.
1460 2018-12-26 17:58:37 Brightest part of my day so far is that stocks are going up a little. I need friends or something.
1461 2018-12-26 17:58:33 Wish I bought stocks in Amazon in November, every cunt for an Echo for Christmas
1462 2018-12-26 17:58:19 Este pedazo de loca no es más bruto porque no le da más. 
La palabra Stocks en ese contexto no significa inventarios, sino acciones.

1464 2018-12-26 17:57:57 What’s the problem in recommendation. All are gems by the way. One can hold them forever. Also current price doesn’t matter in such stocks. Buy and forget. And if possible add more time to time.

They  r not millionaires
Possible  downside wen U've already lost 35% is 2 much of a risk. THATS WHY PPL SELL . Jeez!?
1467 2018-12-26 17:56:42 omg the stocks are soaring ... you know what comes after ... i'd sell like a mo-fo right now if i had stocks ...
1468 2018-12-26 17:56:37 lost a very little this last year, because I move away from stocks  - anyone with have a brain knew the village idiot was going to tank the markets - his buddies needed to drive it down so they could buy back in @realDonaldTrump #tRumpResign #Resistance
1469 2018-12-26 17:55:37 461 stocks in the S&P 500 are green on the day. 76% of them are higher by 1% or more. The last time that happened we were still wiping gravy off our faces 
1470 2018-12-26 17:54:39 "US Stocks rebound as Trump says Buy the Dip"

1471 2018-12-26 17:54:08 I still think the consumer is strong. I like Home Depot here. We own it. Now too cheap. $HD I love control4, we own. Too cheap $ctrl home builders too cheap. Now rates coming down... buying these short term bonds. #housing related stocks.
1472 2018-12-26 17:53:28 Don’t know why anyone would buy stocks today when companies are reporting insane profits and stock prices are low.
1473 2018-12-26 17:53:08 He'll congresspeople have tens to hundreds of millions of dollars they've made off of Investments of stocks and bonds this shouldn't be able to be happening either
1474 2018-12-26 17:52:43 how many stocks？
1475 2018-12-26 17:52:20 HAPPENING NOW: After four-day rout in US markets, stocks jump as much as 3 percent; still mostly down for the week.
1476 2018-12-26 17:52:19 Why don't you make all of the Congress get rid of all their investment stocks and bonds then. If they're not supposed to have any business to make any money on then all of Congress is guilty as hell.
1477 2018-12-26 17:52:08 only thing that has changed is dems won house..oh wait, that doesn’t fit the narrative, hugh hewitt predicted months ago if dems won house, stocks drop 3,000 and he was still low

1490 2018-12-26 17:49:49 Those who say stocks are cheap - what would you consider 2008? US is in the tail end of its growth cycle and still can not top the growth seen in 2007-2008 yet mutiples are alarmingly high. When stocks are trending towards FORWARD p/e median doesn't suggest being cheap #pe #mkt
1491 2018-12-26 17:49:38 entry level engineers seem to get a lot of stocks these days.
1492 2018-12-26 17:49:23 Nada más es que se meta a comentar de lo que no sabe, para que se disparen “los stocks o inventarios” el 3%!!!
1493 2018-12-26 17:48:58 NEW YORK (AP) -- After four-day rout in US markets, stocks jump as much as 3 percent; still mostly down for the week.

1496 2018-12-26 17:48:02 "The market" is a scam. What does @RickSantorum have to say about that? Seriously. That's your metric for the "economy"? How well "the market" is doing. Let me ask. How many of you under 40 own stocks?
1497 2018-12-26 17:47:58 Seeing many traders looking for a specific level on the $VIX for signs of an exact bottom in stocks. These people most likely will be disappointed, the market doesn’t “have” to do anything - whether it’s on the way up or down. Be adaptive.
1498 2018-12-26 17:47:42 . @AP: After four-day rout in US markets, stocks jump as much as 3 percent; still mostly down for the week.
1499 2018-12-26 17:46:46 #Stocks,#Indexes SPX signal still incomplete. Note that the expected rally strength-duration comparability to that of mid-Oct. is an expected MAXIMUM.  Actual rally could be a lot less than expected.  But not more.
1500 2018-12-26 17:46:27 One benefit of this selloff is that some income-stocks and CEF’s are offering some really fat yields. Definitely worth looking into $SPX
1501 2018-12-26 17:46:03 I could be a millionaire if I had bought certain stocks but I’m not so I can only go on what is. Jordan didn’t have ad much free agent power in the 90s as players have now so that argument is invalid. He also didn’t win until playing with Pippin do again team success.
1502 2018-12-26 17:45:22 Stocks tanked, the Government is shut down, a child asylum seeker died in your custody, and you’ve lost the last adult in your Admin....@POTUS I’d say our country is on the brink of disaster. #ResignTrump

Except there are no flight suits. 
And no airplane.
And the jumper is wearing roughly 1bb of stocks around its ankles.
1509 2018-12-26 17:43:46 Dude when I read that last night I had to try and convince myself they didn't mean the whales when they said "stocks", it made me SO mad, like they're not a fucking product on a supermarket shelf
1510 2018-12-26 17:43:46 For shorts, this rally is extremely important. Watch what stocks are so sick they don’t catch a bid. Those are my future winners.
1511 2018-12-26 17:43:35 I got a new iPad for tweeting.
But have a lunch meeting with the broker to buy some stocks.
Later.

1518 2018-12-26 17:42:12 Setting up my 401K is harder than I thought. I had no idea you had to choose stocks & bonds which will either add to or decrease what you’ve saved. I wish they’d given us more lessons on stuff like this in HS.

1520 2018-12-26 17:41:01 Si, el desempleo en EEUU es históricamente bajo. Mi anotación era para corregir un error en traducción del Sr. Petro. Se confundió con la diferenciación entre stock (inventario) y stocks (acciones o valores bursátiles)
1521 2018-12-26 17:40:48 NRA has been trying to push doctors out of gun debate, but medical professionals keep yelling loud & clear, “stop sales of assault weapons, stop R-15 bump stocks, stop large capacity magazines & enforce mandatory background checks.”
1522 2018-12-26 17:40:31 Rates are slightly worse this AM following Monday’s big sell off in stocks. Trading volume should be light as we end 2018. The government shutdown is impacting certain loans.
1523 2018-12-26 17:40:12 True enough. It’s no fun to watch things crater, but ... I sure do need a good chance to build up my dividend generators, and the super high valuations in 2018 didn’t make that very easy. 

Dividend stocks ... yeesh, I’m getting old... 
1524 2018-12-26 17:40:10 We have experienced a 20% nasty correction/meltdown in the S&P 500 since September, and that index still has a dividend yield of only 2.1%.   That's pathetic.  On that metric, stocks are nowhere near cheap enough yet.

1528 2018-12-26 17:39:34 FED is data dependent we keep being told. Strong bad news becomes now good news, as FED can be expected to cut or hold rates sooner.

1537 2018-12-26 17:36:47 Reading FinTwit this quarter has been supportive of the idea that shorting stocks is a non-starter.

1542 2018-12-26 17:35:40 Stocks are Up this morning, as they take advantage of recent selloff, on light trading week.  MBS are currently down 6bps, but not enough to change Lenders pricing from Monday's Mortgage Rates.  Yields are fighting overhead resistance and sit at 2.76%.

1545 2018-12-26 17:35:13 @realDonaldTrump Today Trump said this is a great opportunity for Americans to buy stocks. // please Shut Up, my retirement account is ruined, all the gains of the Obama Recovery have been wiped out by the Trump Slump. worst Dec.since 1929 #ResignTrump
1546 2018-12-26 17:34:41 More like 50%. A simple solution is to reinstate the uptick rule once a stock breaks it's 100 day moving average. The uptick rule is a depression era reform. You can't short a stock when it's falling. Machines can instantly detect falling stocks with little buying then slam it
1547 2018-12-26 17:33:54 @BrianSozzi "Trump just told you to buy stocks" LOL, Great article. I enjoyed the sly humor so much. Thx

1550 2018-12-26 17:33:29 Very Cool ! Hulk 181 does better than most stocks when you look at the year to year price of the book .it has never gone down in value only goes up .
1551 2018-12-26 17:33:21 I’d really like to know what stocks they’re all shorting. It’s really as base as all that.
1552 2018-12-26 17:33:16 rip your face off rally -now the boys pump up the year end numbers to get a bigger bonus - they are unloading their crap stocks to the greedy retail investor - if you have profits - take em - before they take them from you
1553 2018-12-26 17:32:52 My family has it mostly right: I write about stocks for "Rooters."

Previously, according to various people, I interned at Microsoft (long game of telephone there) and worked for O the Oprah Magazine (still don't know how that one happened).
1554 2018-12-26 17:31:54 Hoping someone has an answer for this. With the Dow +440, 1084 NYSE stocks are hitting 52 week lows.

With Nasdaq up an ever bigger 175 points (2.8%), 640 stocks are at 52 week lows.

Advance/decline is 3-1 positive.Up/down volume is 4-1 positive.

What is up with 52 wk lows?
1555 2018-12-26 17:31:35 @POTUS So when the Fed raised rates, Trump said tney should be lower. when the Fed lowered rates, Trump is on record complaining they should be higher. //We have 2 weeks of Market Freefall & your advice? Americans should buy stocks. #ResignTrump #TrumpResign

1568 2018-12-26 17:28:19 the ECONOMY IS NOT OK if masses of people reject buying stocks and start talking about this massive DEBT BUBBLE OPENLY NOW. also credit cards are MAXED BY PEOPLE. HELLO

1585 2018-12-26 17:23:14 The stock market price isn’t necessarily equal to the company revenue trend (which is growing).
I do believe fb stocks where over valued and will normalize soon.
1586 2018-12-26 17:23:03 Let me know if you get a line on some decently priced stocks that have a chance to succeed. I only got 20 bucks to invest tho. Lbvs. My only worry bro is how this market keeps going up and down lately.
1587 2018-12-26 17:22:59 I dipped a toe... invested a 1/3 of my portfolio in growth stocks. The S&P is approximately 20% down from the highs. Next, another 1/3 at 30% drawdown
1588 2018-12-26 17:22:59 Nice rebound in US stocks post Xmas after worst-ever Xmas Eve selloff. Dip buyers saved a day. Could it last? $DJIA $VIX $SPX
1589 2018-12-26 17:22:51 I just hope that everybody is dumping #Gold and buying stocks for the good reasons and not because some central planner said he would print money to save the bankers again.
1590 2018-12-26 17:22:22 The advance-decline ratio was in favor of decliners. Of the 2,061 stocks traded on the #NSE, 742 advanced, 949 declined, and 370 remained unchanged.
1591 2018-12-26 17:21:50 Correction: No one can *agree* what stocks are worth.
1592 2018-12-26 17:21:47 Explain the "cash on the sidelines"? Today I sold some losers for tax purposes. I have the cash in my account. Someone bought the stocks from me. I guess he took his cash "off the sidelines". The only one who has "cash on the sidelines" is the Fed. lol.
1593 2018-12-26 17:21:46 Stocks up! I'm hold on to them though
1594 2018-12-26 17:20:55 I hope we don't get any #fed hike next year first half! Bought more #stocks on Friday and today!
1595 2018-12-26 17:20:24 Today's fingerprints of the FED are GeoPark Lmt only up a few pennies, while gold rally is being faded. Sooo nothing has changed and get ready for lower lows on stocks until they quit manipulating markets with HFT and let the USD fall. Sorry but Santa is drunk again & going down.
1596 2018-12-26 17:19:35 Been negative on stocks all year a lonely place so I wondered what Individual 1's approval polling would look like when the market and economy turned south. We are now going to find out.
1597 2018-12-26 17:19:35 But human psychology is the same, doesn't matter if stocks or crypto
1598 2018-12-26 17:19:15 I doubt he even owns equities. Real estate investors eschew the equity markets and sit on cash until they have to deploy it in their next deal. Also If he were an actual obligor of a proper bank they would have numerous tangible net worth covenants limiting his exposure to stocks
1599 2018-12-26 17:19:05 Dow industrials rise more than 500 points as stocks rebound from a sharp December selloff
1600 2018-12-26 17:18:30 Stocks are surging after Trump leaves the country?  Coincidence?
1601 2018-12-26 17:18:18 Crude now up 8%. Stocks been following oil. Not the other way around.
1602 2018-12-26 17:18:16 Mnuchin has a private meeting with bankers and the next open trading day sees a positive change. Stocks are a scam.
1603 2018-12-26 17:17:55 i love the cnbc chyron -- "stocks have the best day since nov 28th"

and if you bot the spx on that day you would still be down ~12% today

1606 2018-12-26 17:17:48 Still feels like a "trading" rally though, not "the economy is fine so 2019 will be awesome for stocks rally."
A tad overheated intraday. Watching for slight retrace, then another leg higher.
1607 2018-12-26 17:17:43 Although I expect some early January selling, the month may turn out alright, if tech stocks don't get crushed on earnings late January.
1608 2018-12-26 17:17:37 4. No one knows what stocks are worth
1609 2018-12-26 17:17:26 @MrATM_ do you ever sell covered calls? Since you are a dividend and therefore more of a value guy, you want to trim your positions when stocks get too high, I imagine selling covered calls would provide you more income to do what you would do anyway.
1610 2018-12-26 17:17:01 He probably shorted a bunch of stocks and made a bundle. Asshole.

1629 2018-12-26 17:13:57 State trying to get a rally in stocks while keeping gold suppressed (as usual) and as usual it won't work. This rally in stocks & oil goes nowhere until the USD is allowed to fall & gold set free. @LukeGromen
1630 2018-12-26 17:13:42 And the poor are doing neither because less than 1% of americans own any stocks.
1631 2018-12-26 17:13:37 why is grocery shopping ends up with snacks and candies and ice cream? we should buy food stocks, veggies and fruits! healthy food for you dreamies so you all will grow more healthily
1632 2018-12-26 17:13:30 Seeing a lot of this Trump/DJIA thing. Couple thoughts.

Year-end always has high vol and coming off a year of rising markets (which also builds vol), sell offs from bad news on tech stocks got heavily amplified. Most likely, the DJIA rebounds to ~23.5k by mid-Jan.
1633 2018-12-26 17:13:29 Etoro is not an exchange, it's nothing like coin base, you can trade stocks , copy traders etc so you can't compare when you no nothing about the platform, there trying to integrate with exchanges, with wallets etc, which can't be easy when, it wasn't done from the get go!

1638 2018-12-26 17:12:22 Absolutely. Also about his treatise on Airline stocks (he eventually ended up owning one). Buffet is all about a very strong discipline in an opportunity filed time of 2 decades.. where even after massive misses, his return numbers are stunning.
1639 2018-12-26 17:12:13 Stocks seem to be taking the cue that they got way too cheap. Under 15 PE. That’s pretty rare in a strong economy. Can’t think of when.... markets acting like recession around the corner. But still none in sight.

1643 2018-12-26 17:11:37 Sony problem is the opposite.
They shipped a lot of PSC to retailers but it isn't selling and worse many purchases are being returned to stores.
PSC run out of demand whereas NESC and SNESC being far more popular run out of stocks.

1673 2018-12-26 17:05:52 Stocks Down

Commodities Down  all down in 2018.
I wonder why?
1674 2018-12-26 17:05:47 Forward PE’s.  A fraudulent product of the late 90’s -2000 mania to herd people into stocks.  Trailing PE’s are a better measure of “value”
1675 2018-12-26 17:05:45 As stocks plummet. You live in a fantasy world.

1677 2018-12-26 17:05:06 Software stocks up 5 to 10%
1678 2018-12-26 17:05:03 Time to buy stocks.
1679 2018-12-26 17:04:40 So... fastest bear market ever huh? Stocks crashed in December for no reasons at all huh?

1685 2018-12-26 17:02:47 And remember during his campaign, he declared he was out of Stocks and ‘in Gold’. I believe it was in August 2016.
1686 2018-12-26 17:01:50 Because traders are buying cheap stocks. Tomorrow they could just as easily be selling them.

1690 2018-12-26 17:01:17 Correct.  *IF* there's a rebound.  Big "if" in the case of many stocks, quite possibly, even likely, including $TSLA and $HOG, and you have no way of knowing which will rebound.  

Were you around in 1999-2002?  Study the tech bubble, #bitcon, Tulip Mania, South Seas Bubble, etc.
1691 2018-12-26 17:01:03 If it takes you more than 3 seconds to identify a trend on a chart then it isn't an obvious opportunity and you should look for a trade elsewhere.

1698 2018-12-26 16:58:40 Like a ghost from A Christmas Story, the rally disappears and then reappears...still waiting for stocks to rally back up into resistance because nothing is an optimal short yet...
1699 2018-12-26 16:58:21 Stocks are higher today...if we can get above, and stay above Monday's highs, we'll likely have at least a short term bottom.
1700 2018-12-26 16:57:54 Now at 1/2 of full load in $AMD, $VIPS, $ZUO, $PVTL, $PSTG, $HPE

Next buy of 1/4th load will be done if the stocks fall 10% or more in either direction
1701 2018-12-26 16:57:39 Ultimately, though, whether you trade the stocks by hand, with a computer, or put your 'decision rules' into an algorithm, investors buy or sell based on their willingness to pay the price. 

Based on what may or may not be 'rational' expectations of the company's future. :)
1702 2018-12-26 16:57:35 Following stocks are likely to outperform...

1712 2018-12-26 16:55:12 Crude hitting resistance, so that means stocks are too
1713 2018-12-26 16:54:49 Of course he's going to say you should buy stocks, and all the time, you cluck. That's how an economy functions. It's not done, as you might think, by getting more people to constantly enroll in some kind of scheme to pay out the initial backers.
1714 2018-12-26 16:54:48 Having started my career ~20 years ago in the midst of the tech bubble, I remember being confused at the time "why are people willing to buy stocks at such prices/market caps when they literally don't even have a PRODUCT yet?" :)

Tech fascinates like little else?
1715 2018-12-26 16:53:48 Trump told his faithful followers to buy the dip and sure enough stocks are rallying today. Meanwhile, Mnuchin, Ross, Icahn, Murdoch and Kudlow are all getting ready to sell the rip.
1716 2018-12-26 16:53:36 And in an increasingly tech-driven world, the companies with "may take over the world" market opportunity are tech stocks.

In the 1950s it was industrials.

In the late 1800s, it was railroads.

It's always something. (Market) history doesn't repeat, but it rhymes. :)
1717 2018-12-26 16:52:59 Come back to @FifeFlyers
1718 2018-12-26 16:52:23 The Japanese talk about 'stocks' of whales, rather than populations. Given their social and cognitive complexity, stocks just sounds so wrong.
1719 2018-12-26 16:51:47 Yes, divergence of company market caps from their underlying economic "realities" definitely happens. But not unique to modern computer trading.

We did it with the .com bubble in 2000 even worse than FANG stocks today. And to lesser extent "Nifty 50" in the 50s. And the 1920s.

1722 2018-12-26 16:49:31 The observation that drawdowns are result of extreme overbought conditions can make sense if stocks find a floor at or near current levels. 9/10
1723 2018-12-26 16:49:30 All stocks look similar when it comes to how they habe been moving lately. Same with crypto
1724 2018-12-26 16:49:25 Congrats on that! Exactly what Steve said. The market has been terrible and yet the stock has been flying. Also, one of the reasons I was hesitant to load up on shares because most of the MJ stocks were going down with this market carnage. All good though.
1725 2018-12-26 16:49:14 Trumps economy?  How's your 401k, stocks, retirement doing?

1728 2018-12-26 16:49:05 Like tech stocks, $SPY also had similar drawdowns. For example $SPY in May 2015 hit 213.78 high and fell 15.3% to support 181.02 area. In Sept 2018 it hit a high of 293.94 and has fallen 20.3% from extreme overbought conditions to 234 area (potential support). 7/10

1730 2018-12-26 16:48:24 Nice one Amit, I personally think one should buy the stocks one likes for long term if they are available at attractive valuations as no one can predict what the market will do in the short term.

1738 2018-12-26 16:46:58 what do you use to find your stocks?
1739 2018-12-26 16:46:35 An important change I have made as a trader is to observe how my shorts perform in key rallies. Too strong and those stocks are not sick enough to short for long. $fb was well into this category. So many other better shirts.
1740 2018-12-26 16:46:14 I believe that there is an increasing concern where the global and U.S. domestic economy are headed that it is having a downward pressure on stocks. Now how much of it is due to the tightening of money supply, I can't say, but you may be right that it is most significant.
1741 2018-12-26 16:46:08 Yes do not buy this dip. Stocks are going a lot lower. Do not listen to Trump, he is trying to play you! Trump does not buy stocks. Trump is a FED puppet just like all the other presidents. Listen to their economic advice at your own peril!

1794 2018-12-26 16:31:57 For you @realDonaldTrump, who always has to be the best at anything: “Stocks rise in volatile trading as Wall Street tries to rebound from Worst Christmas Eve Ever.”  There you go, the best worst ever. Way to go!
1795 2018-12-26 16:31:23 “We in federal law enforcement have also been told that the government has a full database of all so-called “Preppers.” Those people will be dealt with first  by armed federal agents coming to take their guns, then their food stocks, so food can be re-distributed as the gov sees
1796 2018-12-26 16:31:19 #GoodMorning #Stocks struggle for gains after December sleigh wreck #Dow opens higher, dips to new 2018 lows and is now up 173 #Oil up $2.44 to $44.97 Wake up to the latest @KNX1070 @Radiodotcom @MottekOnMoney
1797 2018-12-26 16:30:25 Or maybe I was trying to better understand your position. But whatever, dude...

Stocks are essentially "confidence certificates" in a company, such that the buyer of the stock is expressing a measure of certainty that the business will make more money over time.
1798 2018-12-26 16:30:23 Or even socks with no ‘Stocks.
1799 2018-12-26 16:30:20 @KRob7 The Pools were never supposed to be used for greasy Oligarchs to day trade the major ETF's, Stocks, Indices etc etc. But they are...
1800 2018-12-26 16:29:57 stocks opened higher the other days and then dropped them
1801 2018-12-26 16:29:29 Many politicians (Trump included) are frauds.  Stocks will go up (and down) in months ahead.
1802 2018-12-26 16:29:17 Its about time....  stocks are over extended IMHO
1803 2018-12-26 16:28:33 Trick Question.
Stocks are only higher today because all of Sugar High from Fiscal Stimulus hasn't yet burned off.

*Now, if Bernie had been able to lift LFPR from 40 year lows, long term growth prospects may have been higher.
1804 2018-12-26 16:28:24 I like the 15 min action on a couple stocks but I need the 60 min to confirm for me to go ahead and go long somewhere.
1805 2018-12-26 16:28:22 $SPY Appears to me that market is making it harder to short now. We're long on what I believe to be select stocks (ETS's) i.e. $LABU $KL etc
1806 2018-12-26 16:27:43 It's the question of Guarantee vs Uncertainty. 
Most amusing part is investors don't accept uncertainty in stocks but will accept uncertainty for their child in horoscope prepared by an astrologer. 
Where as astrologer doesn't have any past statistical data and stock market has.
1807 2018-12-26 16:27:42 I've stayed on the sidelines for a few weeks, but some of my favorite stocks have become too cheap to ignore. Help me decide which position to add to this week. Of course, I'm open to other ideas! $T, $AAPL, $SQ, $FDX
1808 2018-12-26 16:27:37 Ill say it again. I CANNOT STAND THAT GUY. Why the F is he on the show when crypto comes up. He is so uninformed. Crypto has absolutely no bearing on FANG STOCKS. Boycott that show if he remains on asking stupid questions. Then at the end says he wants to buy bitcoin....moron...
1809 2018-12-26 16:27:03 Stocks were so High they had a pillow to fall on Thank Goodness! It should Get MUCH Better After the 1st of the year & 2018 Tax Year is Done!
1810 2018-12-26 16:26:46 Bump stocks? Really?  Not that great anyway.  YAAAAAWN
1811 2018-12-26 16:26:43 THANKS TRUMP -- WORST DECEMBER FOR STOCKS SINCE 1931

YOU hired the Fed Chair

First you criticize the FED, then the next day, you say they are doing a GREAT JOB

Your erratic behavior is making people nervous

You "govern" by what FOX NEWS says.

WORST PRESIDENT EVER
1812 2018-12-26 16:26:38 Just did some quick excel work. Bitcoin has no correlation to fang stocks. Not 2 years ago, not the last 100 days, not ever.
1813 2018-12-26 16:26:26 The 'guarantee' was taken out of context and fully explained in the video. 

My business partner (@1MarkMoss - a 20  year investor in real estate and stocks) says he guarantees a 10X with cumulative profits or they get another year for free

It's not "We guarantee 1000% profits."
1814 2018-12-26 16:26:10 I see 3 stocks 7 minutes during the loading screen and I'm like "okay let's do this" and then I see regular wrecking crew as the stage and I'm like "oh here we go..."

1823 2018-12-26 16:23:48 I particularly like your comment about "the temptation to abandon that [Buy and Hold] strategy" as stocks go lower and lower.   One of the main reasons is that retail investors are not financially equipped in America today, to lose money for several years at an alarming rate.

1828 2018-12-26 16:21:59 I have been  adamant that "lay off bets" should be legal however corporate bookies rarely manage their risk via "lay off bets." Failing to employee "lay off bets" is a colossal failure by corporate bookies.

Pro Investors (stocks, derivatives, etc) manage risk via hedging.
1829 2018-12-26 16:21:15 So nobody sees Ivanka carrying these black planers/diaries? These contain words. Words to advise the presidente from the beach, the pool, the hotel room, golf or tennis court, etc. They look exhausted, consumed with worry abt the gov shutdown, and their market stocks .
1830 2018-12-26 16:21:13 Let’s tweak this a bit. Could this also be said about speculators that buy anything at any price as in indexing and only believe stocks advance? Who is right? Who is wrong? And why? What is the difference?
1831 2018-12-26 16:20:37 Bear market stocks gamble that a company, whose stock has been purchased, will fail. It's a hope that they do poorly so one can capitalize off their misfortunes. The company lays off employees to recoup the losses absorbed by the vultures.  Those who did the real work suffer most

1833 2018-12-26 16:19:24 CNBC Guest on $AMZN: "My analyst are saying you buy Amazon w/ your eyes closed at this level."

A1 advice as always from @CNBC. They can't imagine stocks losing more than 20% of their value. We are about to go much lower.
1834 2018-12-26 16:18:46 I agree that there's a lot of anger from conservatives at the media, but I disagree that Trump didn't get credit for stocks going up last year. The bull market towards the end of last year/beginning of this year seemed pretty clearly tied to tax cuts, & was reported as such.
1835 2018-12-26 16:18:26 Stocks are forward looking.  We all know that.  They boomed when they saw tax cuts and deregulation, and now that the libs control the purse strings, they look at more regulation and more taxes.  not that hard to figure out.
1836 2018-12-26 16:18:21 I mean -20% is a dream opportunity. So why not add to your 401k here. 

Small adds to your individual stocks. $AAPL $SBUX $AMZN etc 

The real maker or breaker will be coming up ERs.
1837 2018-12-26 16:18:01 So nobody sees Ivanka carrying these black planers/diaries? These contain words. Words to advise the presidente from the beach, the pool, the hotel room, golf or tennis court, etc. They look exhausted, consumed with worry abt the gov shutdown, and their market stocks too..
1838 2018-12-26 16:17:35 Secular growth story stocks are holding up the best, will bounce the hardest it seems
1839 2018-12-26 16:16:57 How can the U.S. economy be in great shape with record budget and trade deficits, plunging savings, record consumer debt in credit cards, student and auto loans, collapsing credit quality, bear market in stocks, exploding inventory of unsold homes, and rising interest rates?
1840 2018-12-26 16:16:18 The US dollar has been pressuring the Petroquin market as the first statistical area and the adoption of the Central Statistics is the return of the market by equaling the currency of stocks and penetrating the global trade market
1841 2018-12-26 16:16:07 Can you look at defense stocks? Like $lmt and $rtn. They are down over 40% with Republicans increasing defense budget every 6 months. Worth buying this dip?
1842 2018-12-26 16:15:50 @KaitMarieox didn’t trump banned bump stocks?
1843 2018-12-26 16:15:07 For some reason my grandpa decided to buy stocks in his and my mom's/aunt's names so when he died my mom inherited all this stock that's not even worth much in dividends so she eventually just sold the damn things
1844 2018-12-26 16:14:32 Financial stocks are still struggling today despite the minor uptick in the major stock indexes. $GS is actually trading down into it's monthly chart 200 moving average. will the institutions defend this stock here?
1845 2018-12-26 16:14:32 It's pulled back 20% from the highs. You'd be foolish to not put at least some of it back into market right now. What percentage, that's your call. If you're still semi-bearish, put it in a fund that owns stocks but sells covered calls against them, like $EXG or $QYLD.

1849 2018-12-26 16:12:52 Technical queries during live session r given priority on reply than queries about views on stocks.. so can always push in a technical query if some dilemma exist !
1850 2018-12-26 16:12:48 So which stocks are you shorting/manipulating by doing this or is it just meant to tank the market as a whole?
1851 2018-12-26 16:12:40 What you are seeing is Wall Street wisdom in practice: "Let your winners run, sell your losers". When stocks are down you sell them. When they are up, you don't sell. 

In the long run it does work pretty well, I have to admit, because stocks rally more than 100% all the time.
1852 2018-12-26 16:11:39 Stabbing allies in back. Getting allies slaughtered. Killing children.  China, Iran, and Russia are making trade deals. We are now a banana republic. Stocks are tanking. You’re a mess.

1863 2018-12-26 16:09:15 One of my (many?) bugbears is the business-journalism tradition of giving human characteristics to stocks. 
"Stocks try to bounce back."
No they don't. 
They don't have feelings.
1864 2018-12-26 16:09:08 So the further back in history we go to find the “worst year for stocks” ... the worse the year for stocks??? 

Got it. 

Well how about the *chuckleheads* just tell us that US is in a cycle slowing growth and falling inflation while the FOMC is still hawkish?
1865 2018-12-26 16:09:04 people like spending money on christmas, you can sell stocks to get money

1866 2018-12-26 16:08:52 I think they just said on #CNBC that stocks are at 14.5 time this years earnings.  That’s super cheap.... $aapl $dis
1867 2018-12-26 16:08:51 #Trump The president's adamant stance on maintaining the government shutdown is telegraphing a powerful message to the financial markets, who now view him as a dangerously stubborn man.  The implications for a resolution of the trade war is seriously damaging to markets.
#stocks
1868 2018-12-26 16:08:36 Again, I think it depends on what happens. If Trump negotiates a bunch of bilateral trade deals favorable to the U.S., I think that would be recognized. If markets turn around b/c people look around and see stocks undervalued right now, I don't think he'll be credited with that.

1882 2018-12-26 16:02:52 Mutual Fund Stocks are on sale now. The market is down. Now is the time to invest more not jump off. The only person who gets hurt on a roller coaster are those who jump off. WHEN the market recovers the “on sale” stocks will recover lost funds plus some. Right @DaveRamsey?
1883 2018-12-26 16:02:45 I think it still is Fred. All stocks, defensive or not, getting crushed by the sudden and severe nature of the capitulation. Even things like $XLU (Utilities ETF) are down double-digits over the past 7 sessions!! That's a massive move on one of the most defensive sectors around.
1884 2018-12-26 16:02:30 Years ago, I took almost all of money out of stocks and put it into annuities. I never liked the stock market. Anything you make over years of time can be gone overnight.
1885 2018-12-26 16:02:09 Taking politics out of it entirely, the most likely outcome is a very good 2019 stock market. My point is that everyone now blaming Trump for the bad 2018 market will be AWOL in the event of a stock recovery. Because it isn’t about stocks for them at all—it’s about Trump.

1909 2018-12-26 15:55:29 I think they've sufficiently curtailed the risks of a major bubble at this point that they can pause and reevaluate as data comes in throughout 2019. People who wanted the Fed to keep stocks going up 20% and house prices up 10% are nuts.

GPS works so well because the locations of DC and NYC never change. 
Bid, ask, spread, volume, "momentum," etc. in stocks are changing by the fractional second.
1915 2018-12-26 15:54:07 Remember when we used to BUY stocks above RISING 5 day moving averages???
1916 2018-12-26 15:53:54 Certain stocks may be classed as cheap based on long term results, if a companies stock gets too cheap then they would be taken private and keep the profits to themselves. Hard to value stocks are the ones to watch out for.
1917 2018-12-26 15:53:14 Wall Street Worries
WORST DECEMBER FOR STOCKS SINCE  1931
1918 2018-12-26 15:53:02 Seattle (WA) Times-Business: US stocks rebound as traders return from Christmas holiday
1919 2018-12-26 15:52:59 Great to see the news about bump stocks. And the buying restrictions in Florida. NY, NJ and CT continue to be the bastions of progressive gun control thought. And it’s spreading.
1920 2018-12-26 15:52:51 DRD was up a hefty 15% in the US on Xmas eve. Now up another 3.5%. And there's actually a bit of volume. Could the old Durban Dog be growling at last? It's been a hopeless under-performer whilst other gold stocks have been shooting the lights out.
1921 2018-12-26 15:52:29 Shame.  Watching $HD wanting to explode. When we turn they be some missing out by some on stocks. 10/15% on individuals easy.
1922 2018-12-26 15:51:58 Lol @ market efficiency/rationality

Mid-2018: This market is so overvalued

End-2018: Why are stocks down 20%
1923 2018-12-26 15:51:47 My best guess is that Berkshire is probably around 1.35x current book value, if the equity positions on the 9/30 13-F were not traded at all since. Of course, I'm sure Buffett has been buying stocks, perhaps Berkshire itself.
1924 2018-12-26 15:51:08 Before nibbling at buying stocks, ask yourself “Is the company growing?”  

If you can’t answer the question with a full view, you may want to rethink which companies you are investing in.
1925 2018-12-26 15:50:45 Oops! Your #DarkMoney donors won’t be happy watching their stocks go poof, like a fart in the wind.
1926 2018-12-26 15:50:45 Weren't there regulations on CEO pay that Reagan got rid of; like the amount of stocks as payment to deter stock $$ manipulating buybacks and such?? Also regarding the % of pay compared to median pay. Think that was the case.
1927 2018-12-26 15:50:40 Most of Trump's followers probably can't afford to buy stocks.
1928 2018-12-26 15:50:14 Any stocks you plan on selling? ;)
1929 2018-12-26 15:50:04 So stocks will keep dropping to a point where I can buyout quality companies like $H with a few mil?
1930 2018-12-26 15:49:57 According to the article, Japan's whaling commission or whatever /is/ mindful of conservation efforts and they intend to follow such rules.

They left because, according to them, whale stocks have risen to a healthy amount and the IWC is too conservative for their liking.
1931 2018-12-26 15:49:52 Ohhh that's happened to me before. Teammate took all my stocks from me and just died all four times. I only had to die once and that was it.
1932 2018-12-26 15:49:47 Don't worry, he will blink when stocks keep their slide, unemployment starts to go up, deficit soars,housing slows and farmers keep commiting suicide at an alarming rates up then everyone who voted for him will see the real guy not the apprentice reality star
1933 2018-12-26 15:49:35 Never buy a stock that makes a fresh 52 week low? You realize the market along with most stocks is at more than a 52 week low right? Lol

1935 2018-12-26 15:49:20 Be careful with premature victory laps Peter. A recession and bear market in stocks does not vindicate your thesis. Only a debt crisis and inflationary depression with gold skyrocketing does.
1936 2018-12-26 15:49:19 I am middle class I have had a great year. Raise, Stocks still up over the last two years, and I received a $2000 bonus because of the republican tax cuts.

1939 2018-12-26 15:48:55 There's some great investment opportunities! Returns better than 12%. With stocks falling, the real estate market makes sense! Doesn't it? We've got the info you need to make good decisions! After all, you do want a good return right?
1940 2018-12-26 15:48:17 Sir next month result reason stocks hv to go up...who will sell at such low level
1941 2018-12-26 15:48:10 Yup, talk about "sale prices" of stocks....Coming soon...We agree.
1942 2018-12-26 15:47:36 Imo it’s the best bank and only bank I’d ever consider buying. If I liked stocks I’d be a buyer.
1943 2018-12-26 15:47:26 @BrianLehrer: On stock markets:
1. Reporters admit stocks are loosely tied to economy yet act as if stocks are an indicator
2. Perhaps stocks have been overvalued (see P/E)
3. Execs have focused on stocks at expense of firm (eg, Apple)
4. How many in media have vested interest?
1944 2018-12-26 15:47:02 The PPT failed. Trump's plea to America to buy stocks has failed.

Time for Gartman.
1945 2018-12-26 15:47:00 So he reveals the reason,  wonder what foreign nation is buying up stocks through Americans?
1946 2018-12-26 15:46:55 Losses are tough.  I learned to avoid stocks in the 90s.  I always felt that if they were so good, why were the fees so high?  Why were the stock sales people so highly paid?  It smelled fishy to me.  I was right.
1947 2018-12-26 15:46:53 @cvpayne Stock market is an irrational risk for main stream Americans. The stock market is less credible than fantasy football. Inflated stocks are for big traders and big companies. Refocus business news is on Main Street and stocks will follow. @realDonaldTrump
1948 2018-12-26 15:46:52 For awhile we had very loose financial conditions (stocks/credit spreads), the spike in freight rates, 3%+ GDP quarters in front of us. Their reasoning was at least defensible. Now? Not so much.
1949 2018-12-26 15:46:27 Let’s see, you have no retirement funds in a 401k & no stocks, you don’t work for the govt. so you are getting paid, the pres just said the borders are secure yet you STILL want a 25billion dollar wall?  A wall will stop the VISA issue for sure.  And no that’s not  a credit card.
1950 2018-12-26 15:46:22 Checking in on market, no surprise that gap faded.  Time to start your list of stocks you want and the prices you will pay.  $CONE, $SKT, $VER.F are three REIT plays I am happy with at these prices.  Nibble slow you never know how lowwwwww it can go.
1951 2018-12-26 15:46:17 So the current norwegian prime minister basically said "Let them buy stocks." as a solution to poverty in Norway.

It's the second term of the most right wing government we've had in the last few decades and it shows.
1952 2018-12-26 15:46:08 Didn’t trump banned bump stocks?
1953 2018-12-26 15:46:05 Damn... I should have bought stocks when they were only 280+ up today


1954 2018-12-26 15:45:48 Trump in his 1st presidential debate said that stocks would go  if feds raised interest rates  He called it 2 years ago. The feds raised interest rates 7+ times in 2 years & between that and the dems taking back the house it was inevitable that stocks would start tumbling 
1955 2018-12-26 15:45:33 Ive already stopped contributing to my 401k and moved the money already there out of stocks.
1956 2018-12-26 15:45:33 Exactly.  The economy can GROW while stocks go down. Stock market bubbles come and go.  Obama spent 8 years pumping all sorts of money into the stock market, it's time for that to deflate.
1957 2018-12-26 15:45:31 The problem this country has is you. Your'e a virus. A sad, lonely old bleached blond, home alone and bed ridden. You're like that four hundred pound man who hacked into our election only he never got caught. You did. Nobody's buying your story just like nobody's buying stocks.
1958 2018-12-26 15:44:55 Orange man bad. The philosophy goes something like this : If the stocks swing upward,this is due to the previous administrations policies,if the stocks fall that would be all due to the current administrations policies. It’s liberal science!
1959 2018-12-26 15:43:46 Most non-rich people don't own stocks directly, but still are affected by stock market plunges via their retirement accounts which own stocks.
1960 2018-12-26 15:43:29 World has already ended for some stocks.
1961 2018-12-26 15:43:02 I'd like to hear Buffet is starting to buy into the beaten down bank stocks.
1962 2018-12-26 15:42:56 $spx $spy #stocks overnight futures lows wiped out entire Trump presidency’s gains.

1965 2018-12-26 15:42:20 Ditto with me..i am bullish on stocks, but not so with Nifty Index.. Its likely to hover around +/- 500 pts.. 

However that said, I am bullish on BN.. Expecting new highs on or before election time.
1966 2018-12-26 15:42:13 Santa is not buying this year because all his stocks are on the naughty list after breaking all their MAs. Also the tariffs on Chinese toys has Mrs Claud pissed. Computers only do what their Chinese chip makers let them do so Blaming them is a fantasy.
1967 2018-12-26 15:41:24 When Trump was a presidential candidate he warned investors not to buy stocks, as the market was a big, fat, ugly bubble about to pop. As president, now that an even bigger, fatter, uglier bubble has just popped, he is urging investors to buy.  The candidate made the right call!

1997 2018-12-26 15:36:20 I have thought that for a long time too.  I bought a lot of bank stocks in 2010 and I swear to god they suppressed them on purpose while obama was in office.  I don't have any hard data at this point, but I'm sure we will in time.
1998 2018-12-26 15:35:48 Don't doubt it. It's what markets do. Demographic still favours retirees needing income. Dividend stocks without high debt will have relatively much better staying power through volatile markets. Other stocks will provide trading opportunities.
1999 2018-12-26 15:35:43 Now that stocks are a sure thing, the market will most likely deliver a 10+ year bear market. Like 60's to 80's.

2006 2018-12-26 15:33:47 At this point, there have basically been zero gains in stocks since you cheated your way into the presidency, proving once again that you can't hold a candle to Obama. You're an absolute disgrace and a disaster. #TrumpResign

2040 2018-12-26 15:25:31 do not invest in USA stocks   we are made to believe stocks sell off even if stocks at lowest since 15 years .  Sure  nobody hold stocks at those selling prices. Just computers machines  crashing the monetary system.

2043 2018-12-26 15:25:04 Samuel lo peor de esto es lo ignorante que este tipo cree que es la gente, se crea un indicador que no existe basado en una mala traducción. En el comentario de Krugman habla de stocks (Acciones) no de inventarios.

2045 2018-12-26 15:24:21 #trading #investing #stocks $spx $spy market pundits are like weathermen that look outside to tell you if it’s raining.

2051 2018-12-26 15:23:03 Delusional. Maybe we have dif definitons of "very well".

2058 2018-12-26 15:22:01 Oiga atembao, los "stocks" de los que hablan acá, y que están representados por el índice S&P500 son ACCIONES, no inventarios. Es el precio de mercado del capital.  Excelente el análisis que haces partiendo de una interpretación ignorante del tema 
2059 2018-12-26 15:21:43 Stop looking for attention and trying to divert attention away from your massive losses in the market. You said to short the S&P essentially every week since late 2009, u covered right at the highs two months ago and bought banks stocks and added all the way down. its ur fault

2062 2018-12-26 15:21:19 It means he was short of cash like most people are in life. Those who deal with stocks do not have cash available immediately to pay for taxes. For example in a few days the year is ending. Any one who got major realized gains in earlier part of the year may find it hard to pay.

2064 2018-12-26 15:20:33 1/ That's an excellent question. As a quant, my problem with Bitcoin (and any other new investment opportunity) is that I have no historical reference points. I think seeing how certain stocks behave over long periods of time gives you an advantage going forward. Does the past
2065 2018-12-26 15:20:31 No señor! Te equivocas el término de stocks en el comercio norteamericano hace referencia a inventario, bodega, almacén

Creo que el ridículo es otro

2066 2018-12-26 15:20:25 I don’t see crypto falling alongside the stock market. Fake markets such as stocks will behave much differently than free markets such as Bitcoin. You don’t have political puppets encouraging people to buy the dip in crypto. Also BTC did a 15x last year. Stocks didn’t come close

2090 2018-12-26 15:12:53 The stock market is up today because Trump is the world's best stock analyst and he recommended investors should buy US stocks. Trump cultists follow him blindly as usual. Yeeha!
2091 2018-12-26 15:12:52 Just another indication as to how out of touch with the working class (nobody needed nor asked for another indication BTW).

How many "average citizens" are buying stocks? Most are likely living paycheque to paycheque.

2098 2018-12-26 15:10:27 The ironic thing is we had what was called the Trump bump when he won and as soon as the Dems won the house the stocks crashed. Interesting.

2100 2018-12-26 15:10:18 Robin Hood my arse. Trump has improved the economy, the P/E around 13 makes the stocks most attractive since 2013, and I was surely doing what Trump recommends even some days before he recommended it.

2103 2018-12-26 15:09:42 @realDonaldTrump you're doing a great job. Tanking my 401k, throwing me a non-existent tax cut, letting Putin take over the east,  making us look like laughing stocks in the world, killing kids' dreams of Santa, or just killing them.. same same. You're a giant orange ass. Resign.
2104 2018-12-26 15:09:40 His Tax cut created a bubble. His tariffs created instability. We need to stop measuring the health of our country by stocks. The wealthy own most of them. Time to look at wages and our health. Both declining.
2105 2018-12-26 15:09:22 What policies have the Dems enacted?  They currently control none of the three branches of government?   Stocks are global commodities.  The US does not individually control the markets.  Investors don’t like uncertainty.  That’s what we’re seeing.

I don’t like that he went along with banning bump stocks. They’re not as some would have you believe. Nothing like full auto to me but shouldn’t be banned.
2119 2018-12-26 15:05:26 Hey, Denald, what do you think of my idea: it is VERY UNFAIR that Dow-Jones puts Loser Stocks in their In Decks, so every Day they should take out the LOSERS and put in WINNERS! Then the Stock Market will get REALLY BIG!
2120 2018-12-26 15:05:24 But in stocks, they actually get cheaper if they fall for a month. It’s not the same as a random bet on coinflips. There absolutely will be a bottom, and there will be a day when that bottom comes and anyone who buys, gets to hold on forever. Of course the bottom might be at noon

2175 2018-12-26 14:47:40 Great buying opportunities in this market.. stocks are trading at a discount, heavily oversold. BUY
2176 2018-12-26 14:47:35 I don't know why you wouldn't consider it. It would be an algorithm that takes into data and come up with odds of how stocks should preform. Basically what the people are doing now but presumably faster and more accurate. There would be never a guarantee just like with people
2177 2018-12-26 14:47:34 Do you think the economy is better now than in end 2016? Because your stocks rose to a crazy level , and it means the economy and the future of economy is treamendously better than 2016
2178 2018-12-26 14:47:30 One left - it's on order though. That's the problem when you get to the back end of the year, everything's awaiting further stocks.
2179 2018-12-26 14:47:14 All I have is sand.  Works great.  Last year we VT then striptilled.  This year just striptill between stocks.  Did some no-till last year in some Sandhills and worked awesome.  I’m sure having deltaforce helps out.

2191 2018-12-26 14:43:38 Top Ranked Growth Stocks to Buy for December 26th
2192 2018-12-26 14:43:02 The stocks everyone owns you mean? It’s a relative question and compared to some of the stuff in my universe, they ain’t cheap.
2193 2018-12-26 14:42:50 Always before the end of the year stocks on wall street will regain its value!
2194 2018-12-26 14:42:29 Can opindia and the likes of u do anything other than spreading misinformation? Modi has diverted all urea stocks to Haryana as revenge and u are reporting it as Congress's fault? Well people r not stupid. Wait til 2019, u lot will rot.
2195 2018-12-26 14:41:18 Are you going to buy your cheap stocks or make other investments into yours and your children’s future or are you going to waste it on strippers and other indulgences designed to separate you from your money?
2196 2018-12-26 14:41:13 are the 60/40 funds buying stocks today?  $SPY $QQQ
2197 2018-12-26 14:41:10 It’s amazing the media ignored the huge rise in stocks. But dems get the house and it’s Trumps fault they fall. most of them don’t know what a stock is. But they will be outraged
2198 2018-12-26 14:40:27 I think there are better gold stocks but definitely set up to break out from a bottom.
2199 2018-12-26 14:40:23 Stocks - Wall Street Sees Some Green in Early Trading
2200 2018-12-26 14:40:00 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
2201 2018-12-26 14:39:52 Perhaps Trump was right initially, but once he commented publicly and relentlessly he became wrong. The Fed has legitimate concerns. If Trump was silent any drop would’ve been less drastic and we may have seen a rally. Anyway, stocks are up this morning. #StockMarket #Thefed
2202 2018-12-26 14:39:29 Comparing the Tesla stock to the rest of the stock market, I would say that TSLA is doing good. The whole market is down and so is Tesla but percentage wise it hasnt been conpletly tanking like stocks such as Amazon or Apple.

2204 2018-12-26 14:39:26 Stocks likely to remain cheap for next few months, if not longer. Now's a good time to jump onto Robinhood app and buy stocks with no commission fees attached.
2205 2018-12-26 14:39:25 Bump stocks aren’t firearms. They are an accessory to a firearm. Where does it say accessories shall not be infringed? The banning of bump stocks doesn’t prevent your right to own firearms.
2206 2018-12-26 14:39:14 Stocks are rebounded today after a bruising four-session selloff that put the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 on the brink of a bear market.

2207 2018-12-26 14:38:54 I think that few people who take Trump seriously own stocks (directly).
2208 2018-12-26 14:38:29 Knowing them? Probably stocks lol.

2211 2018-12-26 14:38:19 They can also short a stock which is the opposite of buying and make a killing when stocks go down.
2212 2018-12-26 14:38:19 dude, if drumpf is saying "buy" - i'd HIGHLY recommend you dump all your stocks RIGHT NOW.

2215 2018-12-26 14:38:08 Not in Australia Mark. Here we skew our tax system to subsidise investment in residential property and high payout ratio stocks 

We don't like new technology or the new economy
2216 2018-12-26 14:37:59 @realDonaldTrump if you could stop doing stupid shit and fucking up the markets that would be good. I’m dependent on my stocks. So far your insanity has cost my retirement 100,000. I’m not rich. That money is VERY important to me. Worst president EVER.
2217 2018-12-26 14:37:16 Great, so I should be buying stocks right now?
2218 2018-12-26 14:37:08 Remember 40% in 2 months in '87? And 23% in ONE DAY in Oct '87?
Market recovered all of it in 1 1/2 to 2 years.
Calm down.The money managers are getting out of losing stocks o they look good on their year end reports..come Jan..or actually in a few days ,a huge bounce coming
2219 2018-12-26 14:36:44 Kevin you don’t even have a 401 k or a yacht, you’ve got no dog in the fight.  Do you really car about stocks?
2220 2018-12-26 14:36:43 trump is so happy...he told people to buy stocks this morning...and his followers are buying
2221 2018-12-26 14:36:42 I've also been learning so much about stocks shares and bonds and building companies ............. but I want to approach all of these subjects in my very own way .

2224 2018-12-26 14:34:03 US stocks off to a strong open, DJIA +200, a bit of way to go to reclaim Friday's >600-point drop.

2244 2018-12-26 14:28:16 I have an Idea for @POTUS @realDonaldTrump --
It is VERY UNFAIR of Dow-Jones to use Loser Stocks in their Index. Instead every Day they should swap out Loser Stocks for Winners.

What do you think, @realDonaldTrump? Good Idea?
2245 2018-12-26 14:28:05 Bitcoin is not uncorrelated to stocks  look at 2017, it’s connected to everything
2246 2018-12-26 14:27:47 Markets plunge. Japan’s Nikkei Stock Average fell 5% and into a bear market on Tuesday, following a 3% fall in U.S. stocks on Monday, the worst Christmas Eve trading day in history.WSJ
2247 2018-12-26 14:27:25 Bitcoin may be uncorrelated to stocks, but there is a high correlation between new half-zip sweaters and Christmas.
2248 2018-12-26 14:27:21 Eddy - just so I understand how your list works. In order for it to be successful you're recommending buying everything equally right? If I don't want a few of these stocks does it still make sense to buy the others?
2249 2018-12-26 14:26:29 Watch out for the stock market to be up and the he tweets something horrendous while he has stocks shorted and the market falls and he makes money. If it happens today he should be reported and his portfolio investigated.
2250 2018-12-26 14:26:10 Les canettes dans les stocks sont toujours plastifiées sur le dessus, on l'enlève que quand elles sont mises en rayon
2251 2018-12-26 14:26:04 Valuations today are nowhere near as low as March 2009. And you also don’t rates at zero nor do you have QE. We probably get a 10-15% rally from these levels soon but feel as if stocks see more significant lows in the future.
2252 2018-12-26 14:26:02 $AMZN decently strong Premarket. Her $AAPL $JPM are the 3 most important stocks to me. They haven’t been able to all rally 1-2%+ in the same day in what feels like forever.

Small Growth = +14.3%

2259 2018-12-26 14:23:58 Trump doesn't want them to stabilize. Crash them, keep stocks low so his buddies can buy in, just as he promised them during the campaign. We're tired of people thinking Trump likes anyone in this country. He HATES America for turning its back on him when he needed financing.
2260 2018-12-26 14:23:50 its not that people don't like fort gfx, is that everyone made this in halloween with the same skin, wallpaper and stocks lol (the header is cool tho)

2264 2018-12-26 14:22:32 What keeps you away from buying stocks?
2265 2018-12-26 14:22:26 Oui avec des gens qui bossent 60h sans se plaindre comme la Corée ou la suisse qui possède des stocks d'or monstrueux des juifs et de la mafia . Le Brésil s'en sort bien ? .
2266 2018-12-26 14:22:26 Still missing all his piece of shit stocks, I guess he didn't have time over the break to update the portfolio, you know, with all the crying, and trying to get back all the members who quit cause they went broke.  Followers are falling like his net worth.
2267 2018-12-26 14:22:21 When @realDonaldTrump tells you to " buy the dip" on the stock market, you should do exactly the opposite. The masses are just asleep to what is going on. See what happens on market open. Very interesting times. #stocks #dowjones #NASDAQ #trading #economy

2281 2018-12-26 14:18:15 YES! And if you had ever took simple economics in school you would already see the first signs and that’s housing! Housing is falling and makes up 1/3 of our economy! Stocks tumbling excessively, number 2, next number 3 massive layoffs! Oh that’s already happened with GM!
2282 2018-12-26 14:18:04 Tech-oriented marijuana stocks in Canada and the U.S. are showing phenomenal growth! For example Canada's Canopy Growth Corp. (Toronto Stock Exchange) is up over 2,000% since 2016!#MarijuanaStocks

2286 2018-12-26 14:15:19 Top Ranked Income Stocks to Buy for December 26th
2287 2018-12-26 14:15:04 STOCKS are very oversold (10 on 10 point scale).  I'm going to close out my short position on the open and take a very small long position for a short-term trade.  But this is a very risky trade, because the market is in a strong downtrend.
2288 2018-12-26 14:15:02 Thoughts that make me happy:
Trump's bone-spurs NYT story (he'll be PISSED)
Trump still getting criticized for forcing Mattis out
Chuck's not giving in to wall crap
Stocks tanking globally (Trump being blamed)
House Dems making Trump gnash his teeth in fear
Mueller AND Cohen
2289 2018-12-26 14:14:42 I'm glad he banned Bump Stocks. It is the minimum he could do after two of the worst mass shootings in the history of the US. While he did that he also supported open carry on all 50 states so there is always a quid pro quo with that guy.
2290 2018-12-26 14:14:39 So let me understand this, the government can't get its act together because of a wall but you should buy stocks because things are really great. 
Can you sue Trump if you lose money in the stock market based upon his advice?
2291 2018-12-26 14:14:20 This shouldn’t be news especially if it’s pre-market. Stocks fluctuate without warning daily. Wouldn’t be at least surprised if it turns negative within 10min of opening.
2292 2018-12-26 14:13:38 stocks rise by 1%.
2293 2018-12-26 14:12:37 Stocks are in the toilet, economy on the path to recession, trade war with China gutting farmers and other companies, deficit climbing, bailed on Kurds leaving them to slaughter .. yep, alls good
2294 2018-12-26 14:12:15 My 2019 goal is to get into stocks. Cause ion shit and I know there’s money in it
2295 2018-12-26 14:12:09 fed funds is now at 2.5% upper end, not zero.  much harder for 10yr to track spx over this time frame as a result.  stocks still too high, fed funds is too high 10yr probably too high also.  but until stocks go alot lower, fed funds isn't going lower, so 10yr yeild will stay rich
2296 2018-12-26 14:10:51 Citizens should if course think for themselves.  If they bought ethereum after wave two ended at 83 they'd had done quite well.  Buy silver now too.  Don't buy stocks or treasuries, people.
2297 2018-12-26 14:09:53 Just looked at my 401k, yeah that was a bad idea #StockMarket #WallStreet #EndTheFed #TrumpCrash #recession #stocks
2298 2018-12-26 14:09:01 Indian equities ended higher today, driven by a rebound in banking stocks amid firming trend in the US market. Stocks of aviation and oil marketing companies rose as crude prices fell to USD 50 per barrel. All sectors except IT and pharma closed in the green.

The REASON 4 the stock market drop is because the
DEMOCRATS won the house and the rich look 2 their pockets and the democrats look 2 their pockets
So WHO in the F is looking at MY POCKETS?
2302 2018-12-26 14:07:25 U.S. stocks will not die short, gold bulls will not stop long
The Fed may slow or stop raising interest rates next year as concerns about the weakening U.S. economy intensify. Gold's continued rise is a probable event.
2303 2018-12-26 14:07:00 I started really small and I really recommend that, because you can make small mistakes. 

And by small I mean 50€ on a #stocks trading site and/or 200€ into mutual funds.

2305 2018-12-26 14:05:20 Worth following the work of Luke Gromen on here, FYI, as he and others see UST supply overwhelming demand regardless of macro slowdown, and yields will rise, counter-intuitively ... could make for an ugly situation where stocks and bonds price correlated to downside

2307 2018-12-26 14:04:56 @realDonaldTrump President Trump is trying to pull an Obama by calling the exact bottom in a bear market, though he may be a little early, or maybe even a lot early. Obama called the bottom to the day when he urged Americans, on March 6, 2009, to buy stocks.
2308 2018-12-26 14:04:17 The stock market went down following the elections that caused the house to change hands back to big government dems.  And yes when they are sworn into office next week.  It will hurt the economy and your stocks

2311 2018-12-26 14:04:04 Oil is trying to rise and Trump is encouraging people to buy stocks. A lot of his followers will do that. Past Presidents who said to buy the market were right. I saw a chart yesterday.

2327 2018-12-26 13:55:03 No caravans have been repelled. Stocks average 10% per year so 3% over 2 years is PATHETIC

Yes they scare the foe.

2410 2018-12-26 13:17:20 How i prepare my day.
1. Watch Bloomberg Quint and some other source of news to know whats going on
2. Select 5 stocks by 9 am
3. As im a day trader, i write down how much i can buy using BO by calculating it for each of 5 stocks
4. Entry by 50% first and 50% on retracement.
2411 2018-12-26 13:16:25 I'd pay extra to watch them put in stocks in Trafalgar Square. I'm sure that'd generate a lot of income too.
2412 2018-12-26 13:15:46 mukha kang businessman jan na may-ari ng 30% of stocks sa isang company pero u still use ur old car kahit super yaman na even though u have 5 more expensive ones kasi u wanna stay lowkey and u greet ur co workers with whats up ketchup idk
2413 2018-12-26 13:15:34 Stocks have been volatile ever since Trump took office.
2414 2018-12-26 13:14:38 Wanna deal with me ha budd? I got a lot of stocks here budd. Come here budd. We can make a deal budd
2415 2018-12-26 13:14:32 There's a sale on over at my website at 2pm, Steals and Deals are all at 30-50% off whilst stocks last so you'd better be quick if you have your eye on something,
Message me for the party link 
2416 2018-12-26 13:14:03 I’m doing great! Too bad so sad if you invested in crap. You do know that when good stocks go down the dividend goes up... now go get a good advisor moron.

2425 2018-12-26 13:11:53 Our stocks are down, our interest rates up, the tax cuts did our family no good at all, you shut the federal government down over a wall that the majority of people don't want. Many of your "best people" have quit or are implicated/ charged with crimes.

2428 2018-12-26 13:10:08 His “many people” are those that haven’t jumped ship yet. He couldn’t go to Mara Largo even because stocks are tanking and he’d take a beating.
2429 2018-12-26 13:10:07 What a joke! Even with a 25% tax break for corporate America stocks are down , interest rates are going up. Companies are still outsourcing to India and other so called lower cost countries. #25thAmendmentNow #ImpeachTrumpNow #brankrupt

2432 2018-12-26 13:08:44 So the POTUS is telling people to buy stocks... What could go wrong?
2433 2018-12-26 13:08:19 True, but consider also that cash at 2.40%, gold at 1275, bonds at 2.70%, now don't offer much upside. Either the economy is a mess or effectively the case to switch back into stocks looks attractive. From 2660 then 2530 I think it was mainly technical trading driven + gamma.

2439 2018-12-26 13:06:49 I think there’s a lot to be said about a market that relies on value-conscious trading to set fair prices when more than 60% of the market doesn’t care what price they pay for stocks.
2440 2018-12-26 13:06:47 How does one play this out ? Almost a 200 pt recovery being new to stocks fail to understand this. May be you could help throw some light on this matter

2447 2018-12-26 13:03:30 Yes, makes v g  sense. Low IQ is predictive of “failure”, high not predictive of greater“success”. 
It’s a bit like the correlation of individual stocks. Increases on downward market moves, decreases on upwards moves.

2449 2018-12-26 13:03:18 Agree. Nothing like 2008. The fierceness of 2018 correction makes it feel like 2008. Big corporations trading like penny stocks (automakers and banks) in 2008. End of the year tax loss making this 2018 selling worse.

2460 2018-12-26 12:57:06 I notice many people on TV, on Internet, & in articles try to push concept that stocks are CHEAP compared to before. CHEAPEST does NOT mean not overpriced. If something was 600 when it should've been 250, & now it's 450, it's cheaper, & cheapest over years, but still overpriced.

2466 2018-12-26 12:52:16 Stocks are looking to bounce this morning. Still, this is the worst December ever for the S&P 500. The index is down 14.8% for the month, and 96% of the individual stocks are down more than 10% from their high.

Folks! the world is filled with fear and conundrum as its worst enemy.
2506 2018-12-26 12:29:51 Trump can only focus on one issue at a time.  His attention span appears to be extremely short and right now he's focused on the border wall, so stocks will continue to PLUMMET as the bear in the bear market awakens from hibernation.

2512 2018-12-26 12:25:38 Just like a True Trumpite! You single out the thing about the WALL only. Totally ignore what was said about the Stocks or the Military Generals! Trump better be careful! We, the Military helped build this Country!
2513 2018-12-26 12:20:49 Yeah I understand that you just can't have 3 stocks in your portfolio, but what is wrong with intu? Surely there's some value to having it as a small part of your portfolio, particularly if you're looking for income?

2526 2018-12-26 12:12:40 That's hilarious you're still assuming it's accidental.

The damage is intentional and the Trump admin is malignant. The chaos is Putin hired them for and the shorting of basically every stock while the oligarchs flee US stocks is part of the payoff.

2531 2018-12-26 12:09:29 Sale starts instore 27th Dec great deals not on website. Animal footstools NOW £99. Solid timber 3 drawer Plank bedside NOW £99.... LIMITED STOCKS!!!!
2532 2018-12-26 12:09:24 And if not for the fed, stocks would be soaring.
2533 2018-12-26 12:08:53 If you vote Liberal Democrat ..
You are no more than a Tory sympathiser on steroids, with Nazi tendencies.
You obviously believe in Tyranny and the persecution of those less wealthy, including innocent children.
Should be in the stocks, with your geriatric leader.
2534 2018-12-26 12:08:34 Fortunately or Unfortunately I don’t think they will print more money so growth will be normal going forward once the market bottoms unless of course you pick the right stocks.
2535 2018-12-26 12:08:20 Nope as soon as Democrats we’re announced as control of@house, stocks started tanking. China has just lowered 700 more tariffs
2536 2018-12-26 12:06:32 Unfortunately and sadly there are people that will believe anything and everything the MSM or Financial Experts tell them! The Stocks were going through the roof, no matter what was going on. Then you heard the Democrats and Hollywood a$$holes start mentioning The Economy & bang
2537 2018-12-26 12:06:24 s stocks... heh
2538 2018-12-26 12:05:15 Negative? More like realistic. I’d be bullish if it was a bull market. Already said there will be a bounce, nothing goes down in a straight line, but such damage doesn’t get suddenly repaired in 1 week , look at charts of all major US stocks they are destroyed for now
2539 2018-12-26 12:05:04 Waiting game for twin deficits to matter is over.

We’re currently running our fiscal at 2x+ our trade, removing incentive for ROW to particulate.

We’re also running Treasury sales plus QT near 2x US Corp & Indv savings. Not enough money to bid stocks & treasury auctions.
2540 2018-12-26 12:04:24 You mean the funds will buy enormous amounts of stocks right?
2541 2018-12-26 12:03:51 sm !!! medj madami pa stocks hehe

2543 2018-12-26 12:02:56 Folks, we are headed for a depression, worse than 1929. I’m not joking! Tariff wars are hitting us at an alarming rate! Stocks are being dumped faster than a wildfire!
2544 2018-12-26 12:02:33 When are the American People going to Wake the F$$k Up?This Volatility in the Stocks,Interest Rate Hikes,this is False,Fake,Utter Bullshit!This is pure & simply to ruin @realDonaldTrump the fact that they would go this far, to ruin Americans is because they are Enemies of the Ppl

2552 2018-12-26 11:55:15 Stocks - U.S. Futures Point to Bounce as Trump Sees ‘Tremendous’ Buy Opportunity
2553 2018-12-26 11:55:02 This is some great flow analysis, but you’re missing largest flow piece.

US Indv & Corporate savings ~ 1.3 T

US Federal Deficit run rate through 2 months ~ 1.8 T

FED QT ~ 600 Billion

Meaning not enough savings to bid both stocks & treasuries.
2554 2018-12-26 11:54:30 Sure it does apply. Buffet did his research, found it is a great company to invest in and bought it. Then he goes to the Media to explain why he bought them and the stocks get a Buffet bump. Same applies to QCM. How is it different when you are shorting it??
2555 2018-12-26 11:54:14 Even a well diversified PF will go down when market trends go down. It's always good to hold +10% cash that can be deployed in "close to or after" a crash/correction. Once market bounces back, like it always has, sell few stocks to accumulate +10% cash!
2556 2018-12-26 11:53:42 It’s not just rich people it’s anyone with. 401k and lets be honest rich people are diversified they don’t have all their money in stocks it’s the working class and middle class that is getting their life savings wiped out so maybe it’s not so fucking funny
2557 2018-12-26 11:52:52 ”Stocks fell sharply Monday near the end of what is shaping up to be Wall Street’s worst December since 1931.”
2558 2018-12-26 11:51:54 i still dont understand stocks and shares, the futures markets? Still a fantastic movie
2559 2018-12-26 11:51:05 @EASPORTSFIFA @EAHelp
Brownsword out. Merry Christmas and a Happy New year you motherfuckers. Enjoy the shitshow that youve created, and enjoy watching your stocks drop faster than ever before.
2560 2018-12-26 11:51:02 Those 8 PE stocks would have to show good ROCE improvement going forward otherwise your returns will be inline with low ROCE. Example - Chemicals in 2010-2014 had low PE and low ROCE. Look at recent / current ROCE trend and alpha over the years!
2561 2018-12-26 11:50:54 Congrats. Please change the minimum lot size for trading stocks. 0.01 lot size should be the minimum not 1 lot size. Thank you in advance
2562 2018-12-26 11:50:53 I was about to buy a very nice watch. It only costs P995. A very low price for a nice watch. Didn't buy it tho since there are no more 'new' and untouched stocks of the item. There were other models still P995, but nah I won't take it.

Tough? Yea! But I don't settle for less.
2563 2018-12-26 11:49:16 Top 10 marcap is same as top 10 stocks of nifty 50?
2564 2018-12-26 11:47:18 Don't understand the C2C offers from startups! 
Double what you're getting, but 70% of the pay will be stocks+performance linked bonus+food coupons+other non encashable components....
at last the take home component will be less that what you're getting now!!

2566 2018-12-26 11:46:28 They have been saying it for months, why are you people so stupid? They have been saying the only way ro ruin @realDonaldTrump is to plunge America into a recession, make sure that the Stocks Plunge! Even if it hurst every American, just to get at him! This is all FAKE BULLSHIT
2567 2018-12-26 11:45:16 We got a little glimpse on Monday of when the market bounces how quick it can be. For example $AMZN hit $1307 and that bounced to $1390 within 2 hours. Today will be interesting...again. I would bet anything that Monday was not the first time Tepper “nibbled” on stocks recently.
2568 2018-12-26 11:45:01 Not only that, but three years out from retirement your 401K should not be heavily invested in stocks.
2569 2018-12-26 11:42:41 But I see many decent quality stocks with 8-9 PE right now in market. However on index level market may not be cheap. Buy and sit tight for 1-2 years. Nobody knows the bottom but 8-9 PE never fails you in long term.
2570 2018-12-26 11:42:39 Just 10% above the 200 ma in SPX. If people start buying again there are a lot of oversold stocks to buy
2571 2018-12-26 11:42:28 Wow, @gassin123Charts, like I really needed a reminder of last February—when the $AUD, my stocks, and Ethereum—all went South.

Really harshed my mellow, dude.
2572 2018-12-26 11:42:23 Completely agree mate, US stocks in particular have beer on a tear since Trump Cams to power, unsustainable at that rate, healthy correction only Imv, the economy looks robust
2573 2018-12-26 11:41:02 When many “fisherman’s union” for wale hunting were resolved, because it was very profitable then, most of them were given stocks in ownerships of large trade ships, so these people still live simple lives but are multi-millionaires. Also, as most fish markets are, mob-mentality.

2577 2018-12-26 11:36:42 BTW, some of us "poor people" are glad that stocks are finally cheaper. It means that if we invest now, we have some chance of getting rich in the future!
2578 2018-12-26 11:36:34 walang stocks ng we bare bears kanina hays:((
2579 2018-12-26 11:35:36 You must not own stocks.
2580 2018-12-26 11:35:31 Ben Graham always made the point that even if we thought we had a portfolio of low priced stocks or great defensive bets, if the overall market itself isn't dirt cheap, we should have at least 25% assets in cash / Gold / Bank FDs.

#SensibleInvesting
2581 2018-12-26 11:35:16 Indeed all im saying if you want 80 stocks just go for index saves you time because if its individual stocks you have to monitor them individually and thats very taxing
2582 2018-12-26 11:34:42 Let us hope the stocks will bounce back. The 401(k)s, retirement plans, even the pension plans on people's lives depends on it.
2583 2018-12-26 11:33:43 6/x And if I were to choose a commodity and stocks in the australian stock market I would choose #uranium miners stocks. From 2011 after Fukushima accident these stocks lost over 90% of their value. In 2017-2018 the price of the #uranium grew from of a low of 18$ to nearly 29$
2584 2018-12-26 11:33:24 8/x So in my opinion the #AUD as a currency and the australian #uranium miners stocks could be seen as defensive currency/stocks as @PeterSchiff said in his video.
2585 2018-12-26 11:32:48 Actually not so big wealth effect from stocks currently
2586 2018-12-26 11:32:44 @TopAchat il n'y a plus de PS4 disponible sur votre site. Est-ce un bug ou  vous avez écoulé tous vos stocks ?

Unfortunately, in my opinion, a few big players are controlling the markets. Would love to see how many in Congress sold stocks in November after getting insider tips.
Thanks for responding!
2588 2018-12-26 11:32:22 Sharing 4 stocks to carry for the next bit maybe.

2589 2018-12-26 11:32:16 All of these ads that you’re suddenly seeing about stocks and trading them and all of this other stuff are all so America can convince dumb motherfuckers to dump all of their money into the stock market either to prevent the pending collapse or to take all of the money in before
2590 2018-12-26 11:31:57 Stocks to Watch: Citigroup, Apple, American Eagle, Hess, J.C. Penney
2591 2018-12-26 11:30:31 Lol it doesn’t prove you right or her wrong. 

80 stocks is like roughly just under 4% of the ALSI constituents. 

But def twice the main index which is the top40.

2593 2018-12-26 11:29:49 1/x Interesting  what @PeterSchiff says at 33:30> Sell US Stocks and buy the right foreign #stocks , sell #dollars and get in foreign currencies, sell #US #treasuries and buy debt instruments of governments that are in sounder fiscal positions that gone have stronger currencies
2594 2018-12-26 11:29:14 @TopAchat Bonjour,je viens de passé commande et je voudrai savoir le boitié que j'ai pris et en"Cour de reaprovisemen"et les autre en stocks je voulais savoir comment sa se passe si je recois d'abord les produit en stock ou attendre que le produit "Hors stocks" pour que sa parte?
2595 2018-12-26 11:29:04 Madam suggest few stocks
2596 2018-12-26 11:28:37 I saw this photo placed next to a photo of a rough sleeper, and I wondered if all those who applauded it would like to place photos of their lavish Christmas dinners, stocks of liquor and mountains of expensive gifts alongside the same photo...
2597 2018-12-26 11:25:53 I reeeaaallly need to learn more about stocks and bond but every time someone talks about it I zone tf out
2598 2018-12-26 11:25:53 The Dems taking the House is responsible for the Stock market tanking. Stocks are a future projection of growth
2599 2018-12-26 11:25:15 Even if owner had difficult choice to make, this was absolutely not the way to divest himself of his responsibility for his dog. If caught I'd like to see him put in the stocks.
2600 2018-12-26 11:24:33 Je peux pas savoir d'avance peut être que je serais en salle ou dans les stocks :(
2601 2018-12-26 11:24:27 I think she misunderstood Warren Buffet when he speaks about importance of diversification. Like 6 or 10 stocks thats fine but 80 your money gets too spread out and end up making peanuts in returns all over the place...
2602 2018-12-26 11:24:16 FOREX CALL: BUY GBP/USD ABOVE 1.2705 TGT 1.2725 /1.2745 SL BELOW 1.2675

@MondialCapitalM
2603 2018-12-26 11:24:05 Billionaires make big bucks buying distressed assets. The White House is full of them. Crisis bonds, banks not going bust, dirt cheap property, stocks after sell-offs. Buffet has said it again and again: he likes buying stocks after sell offs! #EngineeredCrisis
2604 2018-12-26 11:23:54 @business @bsurveillance : @CarolineHydeTV : Tell this #EdwardStringham that it's not always true that stock prices reflect future earning. You have a thing call stock market bubble when stocks are overvalued like now with QE. That notion about stock prices is outdated!!
2605 2018-12-26 11:22:32 The financial crisis dampened enthusiasm for “safe bets” on the next big thing, I would assume. I know that this did not affect stocks equally.
2606 2018-12-26 11:21:39 I hate battlefield and 3 stocks takes too long
2607 2018-12-26 11:21:12 Never chase stocks that are high in demand. If you do that, the probability is very high that you will end up buying companies at the top of the cycles #IndianStockMarket
2608 2018-12-26 11:20:04 Stocks are still in a bubble
2609 2018-12-26 11:19:49 With Trump Preaching Buy the Dip, Stocks Look Cheapest in Years
2610 2018-12-26 11:18:47 The stocks crashed on the uncertainty that the new Dems in the house brings. @POTUS tries to improve the economy, but they always find a way to tank things.
2611 2018-12-26 11:18:25 Even though I'm a great fan of diversifying while investing:
- Stocks
- Funds
- Cryptocurrency

And even diversifying within above assets. I always tend to focus on a specific asset.

2642 2018-12-26 10:54:45 Dec 24 (Reuters) - A steep sell-off in U.S. stocks worsened in a pre-holiday shortened session on Monday, as a move by the U.S. Treasury secretary to convene a crisis group and other political developments rattled investors and pushed the S&P 500 to the brink of a bear market.
2643 2018-12-26 10:53:44 Mais le pire, c'est les canettes. Quand on sait le nombre de rats qui traînent dans les stocks, tout le transit, toutes les mains entre lesquelles ça passe... Et on y colle notre bouche au calme.
2644 2018-12-26 10:51:14 I’m definitely getting in stocks this new year
2645 2018-12-26 10:50:40 Most lowbrow : bring back public shaming of certain criminals : publish their names locally with their specific crimes , start putting people in “stocks” in a very public location ! Announce the crime/ criminal in churches . Help them NOT to want a repeat of the punishment !
2646 2018-12-26 10:50:10 With property it’s very hard for the price to be wildly off unless at economic extremes like in a recession like 08/09.

In stocks the gyrations are more prevalent & they provide some good long-term buying opportunities.

If you have a fair assessment of value.
2647 2018-12-26 10:50:01 US stocks swoon changed trend.I say this is long trend.
VIX 1552 changed weekly step and monthly step.
NY Dow-Jones average 301ETF changed weekly step and monthly step.
Thay showed to attack ceiling.
2648 2018-12-26 10:49:11 Put in stocks outside the ground first then sacked. Never in a million years would India not produce a pitch which was favourable to their bowlers. As is the case these days Victoria just does things a little differently
2649 2018-12-26 10:48:10 - December worst month for stocks since 1928

2650 2018-12-26 10:47:59 Thanks for your reply. Please plan one webinar for all your followers, on how are you picking stocks and trade.
2651 2018-12-26 10:47:15 I wouldn't be surprised if Mnuchin & Trump are short-selling stocks & making a killing..
2652 2018-12-26 10:46:44 Not sure, don't follow real estate anymore in Belgium, but in general think it will do well together with stocks very well over next 10-20 years ( in contrast to gold and commodities ...). However compared to crypto it will be a waste of opportunity.
2653 2018-12-26 10:46:33 Dow close Dec 31, 2015...17425.03
Dow close as of Dec 24, 2018...21,792.20.
Feel free to correct my arithmetic, but that is a roughly 20% INCREASE since President Trump took office. If your stocks are tanking, maybe you need a new investment advisor.
2654 2018-12-26 10:46:12 Dow close Dec 31, 2015...17425.03

2655 2018-12-26 10:45:57 Tomorrow @niamheryoumind is visiting, and one of the set pieces I have is two sets of stocks, so I'm thinking we do one each and see what happens! #LaurenLearnsMinis
2656 2018-12-26 10:45:47 The day after Christmas, DOW and Stocks are DOWN, #TrumpShutdow in full effect and @ChristineRomans can only say people are returning gifts because they don't like them?

WRONG! @EarlyStart @CNN @joejohnscnn HAVE YOU NOT CLICKED #ShutdownStories ? People can't pay bills. #FAIL
2657 2018-12-26 10:44:09 Sell out of everything and buy reverse index stocks like TZA. Then dump in in all in, like, a week.

2660 2018-12-26 10:42:10 For Joe Public, longer term, is a diversified bunch of ETFs covering a global spread of markets and sectors and commodities a better idea than a diversified bunch of just stocks?

2669 2018-12-26 10:34:57 @FoxBusinessAM @KristinaParts : Tell this #JoelGriffiths that QE inflated not just real estates & stocks. It inflated asset bubbles at the expense of wage & economic growth, etc!!
2670 2018-12-26 10:34:19 I asked a friend of mine to buy LY Tear and Answer only to get replies that it sold out for Christmas and they had to restock and the stocks will only arrive by Jan. Imglad they're sold out it means theyre doing great in PH but iteans I have to wait for next month. 
2671 2018-12-26 10:34:11 Goldman Sachs said it's overweight Chinese stocks, citing the near-record-low valuation for all sectors in the market and the great room for faster overseas fund inflows.
2672 2018-12-26 10:32:53 Correct! Do you use any software..to filter stocks. I'm sorry to bug you..trying to gain some knowledge from you.
2673 2018-12-26 10:31:47 Ajay Kumar ji, the point u missed that Mr. Sawhney is trying to make is this that if China ever thinks of starting a war, then they have 1000s of missiles ready in each category (along with a massive defence manufacturing infrastructure to replenish stocks quickly) to take out...
2674 2018-12-26 10:29:23 U.S. stocks are on track for their worst year since 2008, which was during the Great Recession, and their worst December since 1931, which was during the Great Depression. If that’s doing well then I’m scared for what doing great or bigly entails!
2675 2018-12-26 10:28:40 Yung excited na ako makuha yung sb planner ko tas biglang bukas pa raw dadating yung stocks nila 
2676 2018-12-26 10:28:34 I don't know about why market closed so strong.. I just know that it was never so weak that it can closed below 10550 with such thin volume.
Pull back mainly based on short covering at bankniftyfuture and add on in tech/FMCG/ infra stocks.

2680 2018-12-26 10:22:51 These 8 stocks are investment newsletter gurus’ picks for the market rebound they expect in 2019
2681 2018-12-26 10:19:01 Ok, I think I have some explanation as to why everyone is so keen to get into Lush. Emma Bell, 24, says she’s heard they are discontinuing the ‘Snow Fairy’ line of products - these are Emma’s favourites and she usually stocks up at Christmas to last the rest of the year.

2684 2018-12-26 10:17:58 Gonna sit down later & get my short list sorted, wasn’t planning on trading for a couple weeks, but have a sizeable position in a couple stocks I just can’t ‘exit’ so might as well trade if I’m sitting there! #Oil, #lithium & #tech names will be first & foremost then $Gold longs
2685 2018-12-26 10:16:46 #ukog ... World stocks down 5%. Expect a 5% drop tomorrow.
2686 2018-12-26 10:15:27 Yup. That part makes no sense to me. We have survived almost all the brutal days...

There has been major pumping into our high weightage stocks so must be careful and watch if any of those start to breakdown. They are our FAANG.

Yes, I did notice he signed an order to ban bump stocks. In a dark backroom, amids al lot of heavy political turmoil. He did it sneaky and secretly, to avoid his base.
2689 2018-12-26 10:13:28 This is fantastic if people actually understand what is going on, this is great for all Humans. Dont be petty about your "stocks" if you are a real investor then this is buy oppty all on sales specially Tesla, as all the risk is gone & you get it at 50% stock growth a year to 1T

2694 2018-12-26 10:11:32 Bad example coz the shareholder yield factor doesn’t say buy the largest dividend payers as a divi investor.

It’s about companies that have shown consistent dividend growth and or share buybacks. 

This is done in a very diversified portfolio consisting of more than 3 stocks!

2697 2018-12-26 10:10:26 Anyone familiar with stocks?

I want to understand exactly how the stock market works and why stock market crashes can be so devastating.
2698 2018-12-26 10:08:40 Japan would like to thank the IWC for rebuilding whale stocks from being seriously endangered 30 years ago, so it can now fuck it up again. In other news Amazonian tribes call for return to cannibalism for “cultural reasons”. Chinese to eat pandas because they need the meat. 
2699 2018-12-26 10:05:53 So since whaling from Japan was banned, whale stocks have returned to normal, which is a good reason to start again....this world!!! #Neverunderstandthehumanrace! @theJeremyVine @BBCNews @scotgp @wwf_uk @GreenpeaceEAsia
2700 2018-12-26 10:05:35 I’ve lost on stocks I haven’t ever lost on & retirement accts are suffering at recession levels. Glad I’m 27 yrs from retirement.

2708 2018-12-26 09:57:29 Ahh. Grant will never change his mind. He believes money is a thing to collect because (understandably, look at our bank accts). By comparision, your comments suggest an understanding of money in terms of flows rather that focusing on just stocks.

However, these doomster "goldbugs" begging for a financial crisis ought to be careful what they wish for, especially if they are positioned in paper proxies and not in physical gold.

2752 2018-12-26 09:11:35 We were perfectly capable of introducing measures to protect fishing stock. You’re acting as if this could only have come from the EU. And in fact the problem came when Spain and Portugal’s entered into the EU, as they fished large stocks.

2782 2018-12-26 08:45:33 Not sure if this will work but attempts should’ve been made a while ago. As I recall, in the past 2 years #45 tweets about some companies/CEO’s affected their stocks. Although the effects were temporary, it became evident that his twitter use could be detrimental to businesses.

2785 2018-12-26 08:41:31 bhai i am under no such illusion that I know all.  Woh illustion to market ne kab ka choor  kar diya.  Let us discuss stocks dispassionately and respect all  opinions.  There is nothing personal here at all.

But retail is dangerously following high PE stocks. Unless they know when to exit, this strategy will erode money

2805 2018-12-26 08:21:35 Yes to nunchucks, no to bump-stocks... I really don't understand the legal basis of these determinations. I used to understand, but the utterances and penumbras bit hard and now it seems like some arbitrary attempt to appease different interest groups instead of coherent law.
2806 2018-12-26 08:20:40 Wait, so are we going to enter a second great depression bc of this stock thing? 

(I literally know nothing about stocks so if anyone that does could please explain it... i’d appreciate it!) #StockMarket #stockmarketcrash
2807 2018-12-26 08:20:25 Adani Ports CMP370.70 ...along with Cement Stocks did a Reversal . Wkly Close on 28Dec18 above 380 may confirm it as a Investment Stock for next few months.
2808 2018-12-26 08:19:41 Nunchucks are a gimmick. I looked at the shenanigans the "utterances and penumbras" used to exclude bump-stocks... Not a clever move - they can be jerry-rigged fairly simply. If they were genuinely worried they'd make them have serial numbers and surveil the buyers.

2829 2018-12-26 07:54:20 I agree fully. Trump's pulling out of mid east. If US isn't @war this affects military type Co stocks! Then the Dems want to raise taxes hugely. If they gain power it'll put a halt to good jobs! This makes me believe Co's considering coming back may not. It's too expensive. ..
2830 2018-12-26 07:54:05 IRA money pouring in early January and Q418 earnings = bullish. FED will stop hiking, bonds paying 3%? No thx. Stocks are pretty cheap at these levels in comparison. Eventually inflation will blow out and gold will rally, maybe a dollar confidence fallout, but thats yrs out imo
2831 2018-12-26 07:52:25 It's going to be a very peculiar rest of 2018... Such a contrasting difference between stocks and crypto... I think most of us are positioned quite well in more than one way.

2841 2018-12-26 07:41:54 Let's see! Stocks are tanking, You say Mexico pay for the wall! Then you get scared when Mexico says F-You!

2842 2018-12-26 07:39:52 This is not intraday trade... It's my view and the stock won't get to the target within 2-3 hrs...

2879 2018-12-26 06:59:27 I assumed that stocks which rise and fall a lot are prone to seeing a dip at the end of the year, because there are people who like to dump things in order to help their income tax.

2888 2018-12-26 06:53:32 I mean, shouldn't the advice be to start out with 100% stocks while you are young, and gradually shift towards more stable assets as you age?

I'm wondering .. is the social contract in the US really so broken so that people are forced to keep speculating? Or do they choose to?

2896 2018-12-26 06:48:45 One thing that puzzles me is that a lot of US people seem to keep a very large ratio of stocks in their 401K, even as they approach or pass retirement age (I'm entirely basing this observation upon Twitter threads).

Is this really so? If so, why?

2899 2018-12-26 06:45:44 This year BTC taught us how to survive a bear market. Use it next year to trade global stocks. Winter is here.
2900 2018-12-26 06:45:36 Unless you're retiring tomorrow, you're fine. And if you're retiring tomorrow, your money shouldn't be in stocks subject to volatility like this.
2901 2018-12-26 06:44:15 Chromcide has nothing to do with the MU itself though but I'd personally take stunning then killing at 0 without trading stocks over trading stocks with a suicide move even if it may be more consistent. Chromcide isn't something you see very often though outside of just clips.
2902 2018-12-26 06:43:08 I mean there’s no need because they’ll show you the stocks whenever a ko appears but the poll has spoken
2903 2018-12-26 06:42:44 This is not a very Merry Christmas. My stocks have plummeted and federal workers are out of pay. This is ridiculous
2904 2018-12-26 06:42:26 Stocks last week had their worst week since the Great Recession a decade ago, and the last time the market fell so far in December was in 1931, during the Great Depression. MAGA!!!
2905 2018-12-26 06:40:56 singlehandedly destroyed the franchise. their stocks are plummeting as we speak
2906 2018-12-26 06:40:33 But short period of stocks prices will recover soon.
2907 2018-12-26 06:39:49 Stocks are experiencing their worst decline since the financial crisis a decade ago amid worries about, among other things, a slowing of corporate profits and the impact of a trade war on global growth.
2908 2018-12-26 06:39:43 I have a feeling that the market will have one last crash on the last trading day of the year and will rally on Jan 2nd. How long would rally last would depend on how cheap stocks get before that.
2909 2018-12-26 06:38:39 Bought stocks on speculations (E.g. Jet Airways and Sun Pharma)
2910 2018-12-26 06:37:10 @VetriSmv @Datta_karan you need very high conviction,if your portfolio is having only 3 stocks. It's like you are acting like an entrepreneur who know that business insights very well. Also ready for any significant downside in portfolio like business can't earn profit every time
2911 2018-12-26 06:35:38 Which stocks are being affected by the shutdown?
2912 2018-12-26 06:35:06 I have to say this
Donald Trump cannot stop the economic crisis. No way since he lost midterm. 
Yes the stocks can rally again for 3 mths at most.
But the crash is still coming.
@realDonaldTrump
2913 2018-12-26 06:34:39 Facts:
Country doing well? Stock market into Bear territory, down 20%.

Securing borders? Borders are secure, “Wall” is ego-play to base. 

Great trade deals? Tariffs are hurting farmers, manufacturing, and stocks.

Troops home? Hurting allies, helping adversaries, helping ISIS.
2914 2018-12-26 06:34:25 Strong disagree (in some cases). Long-term, some portfolios that underperformed in 2018 could far outperform. Many small/micro cap growth stocks killed past 6 mos. 

Many factors will determine whether 2018 under/overperformance was signal or noise for individual portfolios.
2915 2018-12-26 06:33:33 as US stocks have  the worst time for a decade amid growing concerns over global growth and  geopolitical risks.
2916 2018-12-26 06:31:12 Stocks still going down. Crypto has basically hit the bottom and not going down anymore.
2917 2018-12-26 06:29:09 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
2918 2018-12-26 06:28:47 Wow. Those 30s lighting setups got some amazing angles. Two figures lit differently, on different stocks, out of phase with the background.

What is this “proof” of again?
2919 2018-12-26 06:28:45 As FAANG stocks falter, fund managers make bets on survivors
2920 2018-12-26 06:28:30 Well I guess it's a good thing that you and president Trump baned bump stocks now all our problems are solved?! As a NRA life member I was very let down!  I had been saving to buy NRA memberships for all my family members that are not currently NRA members.

2923 2018-12-26 06:26:15 Arun, I m admirer of the way you explain things and choosing most suitable words.
One question intrigues me as why u have put all your savings in Mutual fund (PPFAS LTE Fund & ICICI Pru Large & Mid cap Fund) rather than in individual stocks while your job involves equity reserach

2930 2018-12-26 06:20:15 Market corrections often give hints of the potential leaders of the next rally. Keep observing stocks that show resilience during bad phase. They may be the first to lead.

2932 2018-12-26 06:17:21 Who Knows stocks?
2933 2018-12-26 06:17:20 @smartertrader can you list your top 3 overvalued stocks in a bear market if it continues? Without #China stocks. So many have dropped, hard to tell. $NFLX $AMZN $TSLA
3 best to average in. $AAPL, $WMT, $JPM. Everything changes if the #FED changes. Just my opinion.
2934 2018-12-26 06:16:36 Twitter doesn't know what to do anymore as their stocks went in the toilet after their last shenigan if I remember correctly
2935 2018-12-26 06:16:34 Maybe if you spent more time on that then baning bump stocks you'd have the wall by now!
2936 2018-12-26 06:16:18 Whales eat fish in huge quantity to achieve such sizes, fishing them is a way of maintaining the fish  stocks Japan heavily relies on, it's also obvious nobody will eat something that is not readily available for consomption owing to bans on it. IWC should have imposed quotas.
2937 2018-12-26 06:16:10 The fall was technical and nothing has changed on the fundamentals front. Booking profits is part of every stock's journey. Stocks that rise up that much also correct to large extents.
2938 2018-12-26 06:16:10 hmm. you can trade stocks or buy options then.
As you must have seen, we recommend minimum capital of Rs. 1.5 lacs per lot of futures

2947 2018-12-26 06:06:12 Cautious call - Restrict yourself from   executing sell on Nifty or BANK NIFTY index and stocks were in positive trend from couple of weeks. #Market may bounce back any point of time. #nifty #BANKNIFTY
2948 2018-12-26 06:06:04 Bravo! Gas prices alone right now is putting money in people's pockets all across the forgotten lands of the Midwest. Certain major stocks have to tumble (talking to you social media stocks) because they have very little real income.  People are buying stuff, that is real.
2949 2018-12-26 06:05:49 Sir , Investing in  Family stock Portfolio is like per stock per year or SIP based like investing equally to all stocks ?
2950 2018-12-26 06:05:22 Then why is the P/C ratio at 10 year highs, sentiment the most bearish since Jan 2016, Aug 2015, and Mar 2009, and stocks still falling? "Everyone". LOL!
2951 2018-12-26 06:03:44 Does that mean their stocks on big pharma would also tank? You better hope it does. Watch. Martha Stewart was put in prison for insider trading. How is the Democrats steering us to certain health plans so they can invest in those markets any different. They know before we do.
2952 2018-12-26 06:02:33 The stock market does not always reflect the health of the economy although that's what most people tend to think. Stocks are a poor measure of the strength of any economy.
2953 2018-12-26 06:02:02 You never put America first it's always Trump first- Country is not doing well the stocks have plummeted and erased all gains and more- your crimes are destroying America if you cared about the USA you'd resign
2954 2018-12-26 06:00:10 It's December 26, 2018 at 02:00PM. Does anyone have any interesting #financial #stocks #tech stories to share?

2961 2018-12-26 05:51:42 How is this impact of demo? Mutual fund assets were growing strongly even before demo. The mutual fund flows are more due to out performance of stocks and under performance of real estate. Do you have any evidence that links this with demo?
2962 2018-12-26 05:51:30 Graphite stocks around the world have capitulated. They are currently trading near their 52w lows. We are far better. Reason: We never were that expensive.
2963 2018-12-26 05:51:17 How to buy stocks from NASDAQ? Anyone could recommend a good/save platform?

Yup. Capitalism.

2986 2018-12-26 05:32:25 So what you’re saying is global stocks would have sunk even without the head clown screwing up tariffs and shutting down the US Govt. from one “clown” to another, that’s a load of horse shit at its finest.

3002 2018-12-26 05:22:58 There was know booming Economy during the Obama era..stocks didn’t begin to rise until the very day Trump was inaugurated and Obama was out. Obama over regulated businesses putting many out of work and living on food stamps. Trump pulled out his magic wand and brought jobs back

3027 2018-12-26 05:04:08 In 1986, IWC members agreed to a moratorium on hunting to allow stocks to recover. Pro-whaling nations expected the moratorium to be temporary, until consensus could be reached on sustainable catch quotas. Instead, it became a quasi-permanent ban.

Good for Japan. Walk away.

Also, resign.
3054 2018-12-26 04:47:01 When we are out of this market slump things will grow! Jobs, fair trade w/other countries, stronger dollar, manufacturing coming back to U.S., all good! Time to buy those FB or AAPL stocks! Absolutely!

3057 2018-12-26 04:44:21 GUO YIN UNITY stocks climb despite troubling geopolitical headlines
3058 2018-12-26 04:44:19 Zuckerberg, Bezos and Google’s CEOs sold quite a bit of their stocks to cash out at the top. Insider trading?
3059 2018-12-26 04:43:42 Yep.. there is an eerie similarity to 2016 when we had an energy driven capex recession and SWF liquidating stocks to fill budget gaps
3060 2018-12-26 04:43:21 No doubt in my mind that all of those things are exaggerating the move and with stocks at these valuations I would be shocked if we don’t snap back hard before the market shows it’s hand.
3061 2018-12-26 04:41:49 Hold on, what happened to the graphite twins? down 5%? I was told these stocks will keep going up for a long time, they were such blind buys.

3063 2018-12-26 04:39:19 There’s is widely admitted to be roughly around a billion ounces of silver in existence in above ground stocks. Which is about the amount of silver that’s mined out of the earth’s crust in 1 year. 
So silver in reality is more rare above ground on the planet than gold.
3064 2018-12-26 04:38:57 Not sure that ratio makes sense tbh. Profit margins appear to be sustainably higher with tax rate changes also impacting things. Also stocks include foreign stocks and foreign earnings. This stat is stat bears love to use. Rightly so far.
3065 2018-12-26 04:38:28 I told you so. If Democrats take the House, it will be Stocks sell-off. Obama bad economy will come back. The American worker will lose 401K. Retiring money. VOTE REPUBLICAN. Don’t trust any left-wing Democrat.

Would you like me to reserve you some? Kasi sobrang limited lang po ng stocks ko ng lucisan at dk since I was still testing the waters when it comes to gbf merch xD
3067 2018-12-26 04:35:46 There could be many reasons the stock market is dropping. Democrats won the house,
large social media companies stocks are falling,
People are actually opening up savings accounts again,
The feds are raising the interest rates too quickly, the ones they kept in 0 to prop up BHO
3068 2018-12-26 04:35:03 Perfect timing, US stocks on the decline, US .gov partial shutdown, snap elections being called for Israel, situation changing on the ground in Syria.

3070 2018-12-26 04:33:28 1% is doing well, for the moment. Watch the stocks for their wages. 'Securing border' = STILL locking children in cages, rehashing trade deals to screw over the working class more, and pulling out of 1/7 illegal wars. But sure, celebrate Sky Daddy more
3071 2018-12-26 04:32:37 Except illegals commit fewer crimes than natives. Read the entire thread? Also, their coming here is their only "crime" and far less damaging than securities fraud, betting against yourself in mortgage stocks and looting workers' pensions. #ComeCorrect

3088 2018-12-26 04:25:09 $ may bounce and make new highs shorter term 2-4 months. However be prepared for 0% rates once again. Also when the curve starts steepening value will out perform growth stocks imo. But looks like $QQQ going to an 80$ handle

3103 2018-12-26 04:14:20 Believe it or not n again not repeated by main stream media, trump just last week signed into law banning the bump stocks which doesn’t allow a weapon to rapid fire.  A huge deal n goes against their narrative along with crime bill reducing jail time also passed-no coverage -zero
3104 2018-12-26 04:13:51 Hey dougie...I don’t recall you raising any objections when obama, as president (as frightening as that is to this day) in a more overt fashion said to buy stocks in the midst of a draw down of even greater proportion. Why not dougie? Because you are a blind trump hater perhaps?
3105 2018-12-26 04:13:37 the only thing keeping me from succumbing to end-of-Christmas sads is knowing me'n the brother are gonna hit up the game store tomorrow to look for oversized d20s for a kid's DND gamehe wants to run and I'm gonna treat myself to set of new dice cause the store stocks HDDice

3108 2018-12-26 04:11:14 Really my trader friends say it’s a unstable market 1) the stock buy backs ran out 2) trade wars 3) trump talks stocks go down. Watch if he shut up for a month they might go up. Stop fooling yourself with trumps blaming of the fed.

3112 2018-12-26 04:09:17 The GD and the Bubble were caused by lack of congressional regulation. In both cases, it was legal to borrow to buy stocks (or houses) with next to zero oversight. When the bubble burst, everyone was in debt with no funds to pay it off.

3116 2018-12-26 04:07:00 So true. The fact that I sold a few stocks before they dropped 20% was sheer coincidence. I absolutely did not see this coming.
3117 2018-12-26 04:06:55 You must not have any stocks in the market
3118 2018-12-26 04:06:00 She must be sitting at home checking her stocks.

U.S. Stocks Fall Sharply Ahead Of Christmas Holiday: 
It's very possible that the market will end this month as the worst December for stocks since 1931.
3125 2018-12-26 04:01:36 Someone should check the stock portfolio account of all who knew ahead of time what actions he and Trump were going to take, right after their actions in the past several days, knowing that the actions would most likely cause a huge drop in the market. Anyone shorted some stocks?
3126 2018-12-26 04:01:07 So I was off a couple of years. It was trading at 2x. Dirt cheap during that secular bear. Anyone else looking at super cheap stocks? Plenty out there paying dividends and trading with single digit P/Es. P/Es of 5. Could be value's chance to shine in 2019.
3127 2018-12-26 04:00:56 eh I can be pretty autistic on 2A issues mainly because I just don't trust our lawmakers not to slip in some bullshit that drastically changes the whole scope of the intended law. But I could see that being reasonable. but certain things I just don't care about like bump stocks
3128 2018-12-26 04:00:47 I warned someone at work last year this would happen. She said, “My 401K has never done better!” Bet she’s not so happy with Trump now. I moved my 401K shares out of stocks.

3132 2018-12-26 03:59:25 when a company we own is available at a discount we should be happy to buy it!

we dont own stocks,we own companies. and companies dont change overnight...if people think this way most questions r answered!
3133 2018-12-26 03:59:16 Instead of paying workers more money and expanding production capacities companies used their cash to buy back their own stocks ...if that’s not insane I don’t know what is.
3134 2018-12-26 03:56:27 @kobebryant Yo Kobe sell all your stocks, mutual funds etc.

3138 2018-12-26 03:52:32 96% of investment fund managers do not beat the S&P 500. And the 4% that do are not the same year over year. So you can remove the burden of trying to pick the best stocks. Invest in low-cost index funds.
3139 2018-12-26 03:52:16 @roysebag Stocks are not equivalent to and thus can not replace savings. If you buy a stock with your savings you have delegated the responsibility of saving to the seller of the stock: If he spends the money you gave him (=consumes) society has no savings to invest in capital.

3142 2018-12-26 03:49:31 Does this mean that we should not buy stocks starting Jan 2019 ?
3143 2018-12-26 03:49:22 People on elite smash that play with 2 stocks and quit after the first game can go to hell lol
3144 2018-12-26 03:48:31 Nothing in investing is a guarantee. But real estate is low risk compared to stocks and crypto and such but yes technically it takes more to get into.
3145 2018-12-26 03:47:14 yan yung time na nagkakaubusan ng stocks no :(((((
3146 2018-12-26 03:46:46 Always had a passion for the Stocks
3147 2018-12-26 03:46:45 That’s awesome!  I had thought about giving my nieces and nephews some stocks, but the only place I looked was super expensive.
3148 2018-12-26 03:43:26 I lost half of my 403b in the 2008 crash. Luckily I had 9 years to rebuild it before I retired.

My mom passed away last year, leaving me a little nest egg that she’d put into stocks over her lifetime. I’m watching that dwindle right now.
3149 2018-12-26 03:42:43 Can you believe I spent my day making money, plotting, shifting investments & stocks? Ha @Forbes ready for more color on your cover?
3150 2018-12-26 03:42:34 Monday, Dow drop 2.9% to 21,792.20, breaking 1918's record for worst Christmas Eve performance. Nasdaq lost 2.2% to 6,192.92. S&P 500 fell 2.7% to 2,351.10. U.S. stocks are on track for worst year since 2008,the Great Recession, and worst December since 1931, the Great Depression
3151 2018-12-26 03:42:10 The market had recovered from when he had taken office. It is a direct result of trump’s mouth that the stocks have been so volatile.
3152 2018-12-26 03:41:29 A kid died, stocks plummeted and federal employees aren’t getting paid for the Holidays. Blind devotion is a hell of a drug!

3158 2018-12-26 03:39:17 Besides,  with the market down  stocks are on sale..... better than Black Friday. If I  don't work tomorrow,  I plan on taking advantage of it. If one isn't in it for the long haul, it's best to stay out.
3159 2018-12-26 03:39:09 I'll be doing a new Value Investor Podcast tomorrow on stocks that are on sale. Also, I will have a new Market Edge Podcast with @johnblank100 on recession chances in 2019 and what that means for investors. Don't miss these episodes tomorrow!
3160 2018-12-26 03:35:00 ...don't gloat,  @SeanMcElwee;q tens-of-millions of 'Regular Americans' have ALSO watched OUR stocks-based IRAs, 401Ks & Pensions suffer these losses - with NO 'alternate retirement income sources'...
3161 2018-12-26 03:34:34 The market is not the economy.  When interest rates go up, individual investors may go to bonds instead of stocks.  Less risk and finally some return.   Large investors will not borrow money to invest in stock market either.
3162 2018-12-26 03:34:29 He's not even correct. 29 market topped at 381 & crashed to almost 200 by Nov '29, almost 50%.  We then had a 50% rally into 1930. The bulk of the damage happened in 1931 & was accompanied by policy errors and an unregulated and leveraged financial system, many banks owned stocks
3163 2018-12-26 03:34:23 At 8:00 a.m. IST, the SGX Nifty Futures was trading 0.2% higher at 10,636.5. It is at a discount to the Nifty’s previous closing of 10,663.5. On Monday, FIIs/FPIs were net sellers. They sold stocks worth INR 577 crore. DIIs bought stocks worth INR 186 crore #SGXNIFTY #NIFTY

Let the techies invent all the cool shit they want. Then tell them to build it. Get the point? And let's not forget; if you want to continue wars, DEMS. You need to build.

NASDAQ 


3182 2018-12-26 03:27:26 Dow Futures down 110 points. What it tells you? 

Dow breakdown will not let Nifty settle. It will push Nifty towards 10450. 

Index heavyweights wont be able to stand before this fall.

3183 2018-12-26 03:27:07 Stocks are pieces of paper. Just like dollars. Fiat currency. All really worthless in a death spiral. Remember that. 

If a stock entitles you to a future share or profits in a cash flow negative company, what is it worth? Lot of companies in the RUT make no money...
3184 2018-12-26 03:27:00 Trump has decided that, because the stock market has begun collapsing as a result of his own failures, someone in his administration must take the blame. Yesterday he publicly attacked his own Fed Chair Jerome Powell, but sent stocks plummeting further

3189 2018-12-26 03:24:37 The reason I left the NEA is because they compromise on our rights. They are the ones who pushed for the ban on bump stocks. Our rights are God given and man has no jurisdiction in telling us what we can or can’t buy. 16th jurisprudence 256.

3193 2018-12-26 03:20:41 Umm. Did the market really crash? NOPE! Investors will return soon when they realize how cheap tech stocks are. Happens every time there’s a major correction.
3194 2018-12-26 03:20:40 During the panic of 1907 stocks dropped 45% in 3 weeks. No algos. Octcober 1929, human emotion, no algos. When Prohibition was repealed on Dec 5, 1933 DOW had major rally; no algos, no fundamental news. Shit just happens.
3195 2018-12-26 03:19:43 When the president or CNBC tell you to buy stocks, you should run away as fast as you can!  We all remember when G.W. Bush told us to just go shopping...lol

U.S. stocks tumbled to the lowest since May 2017 as the turmoil in Washington kept investors on edge after the worst week for American equities in almost a decade. Crude sank below $45 a barrel and the dollar tumbled.

3226 2018-12-26 03:04:41 That depends and very stock specific, they may have plans for some stocks but not all. And sometimes it can be just hedge against holding.
3227 2018-12-26 03:04:41 As of now, “this is going to be the worst year for U.S. stocks since 2008. The Dow is up 18% under Trump, compared with 45% at this point under Obama. The Dow and S&P 500 are expected to notch their worst December performances since 1931.“ Obama better than you every dept.

3247 2018-12-26 02:51:56 Japanese stocks saw gains during trade on Wednesday morning following a Christmas Day plunge of both the Nikkei 225 and Topix.

The mainland Chinese markets, watched in relation to the trade spat between Beijing and Washington, also mostly saw gains in early trade.
3248 2018-12-26 02:50:55 Long term investors don't care about market "cycles." If I sold stocks every time a bear said "the doom is coming" I'd never have much of anything. Stocks are up much more than they are down. You buy great American companies when they are cheap. You hold. Simple.
3249 2018-12-26 02:49:58 If you didn’t ride GoPro from the top all the way down to the bottom in 2015, did you even trade stocks?
3250 2018-12-26 02:49:29 Outlook for today 26.12.18 markets will be sideways. #FIIs were sellers. Beaten down stocks might correct. Let's see #Trump shutdown already giving jitters to world markets. #crude big positive for our markets. Its down to $50....
3251 2018-12-26 02:49:27 NIFTY struggling to close in positive territory in 2018...business channels still talking about revival of capital goods' oriented stocks....
3252 2018-12-26 02:49:13 Man wtf if you dont change the damn stocks to 4
3253 2018-12-26 02:48:50 Once again.. you haven’t explained the mechanics of QE asset swap affecting stocks.. stocks are bought by pensions, individuals and hedge funds.. none of them get “free money from the Fed” to do so
3254 2018-12-26 02:48:49 Importa claro por que el metodo de financiamiento k era por agregados monetarios al 40 % de la base monetaria anual y consumo de stocks no entraba ni un dolar de inversion y para rematar acumularon el equivalente a 26.000 millones de dolares en lebacs.
3255 2018-12-26 02:48:37 Analyzed health/stability of both $NH $NK via major social media& publications. Feedback remarkably upbeat, opposite to complete stocks capitalization.

3256 2018-12-26 02:48:23 My stocks have been incredibly strong - but took a significant hit.  It’s a real pisser.
3257 2018-12-26 02:48:20 Buy and trade for the rips? Or buy and hold stocks long term?
3258 2018-12-26 02:47:15 Maybe drones with bump stocks 
3259 2018-12-26 02:46:34 when stocks are doing well, it’s all bc of OBAMA, but when stocks go down its Trumps fault! Can’t have it both ways!
3260 2018-12-26 02:46:16 all my pot stocks tanked the day after legalization. they are still in free fall
3261 2018-12-26 02:46:12 That scripture sends chills through me! God has been thinking of us centuries before Christ's earthly birth.

3263 2018-12-26 02:45:02 How management communicates mistakes is very important. No one is mistake-free - as investors 40% of the stocks we buy underperform the market - and I'd be concerned about any company where shareholder communication doesn't include a candid assessment of mistakes. - Bill Nygren
3264 2018-12-26 02:43:56 Mostly gold, then after the recession I'll sell the gold and buy stocks and real estate. Cause you buy real estate not before the recession, but after, when the prices are low.
3265 2018-12-26 02:43:44 I see the stocks tanking because of the PRIVATELY owned Federal Reserve Bank 
3266 2018-12-26 02:43:35 apple stocks rise by 10%.
3267 2018-12-26 02:42:30 still mostly a volume shooter but he’s looked pretty solid all-around in the minutes i’ve seen this year and statistically. stocks and passing numbers are way up, and he’s looked decent attacking closeouts but he’s not much of a ball handler and never gets to the line
3268 2018-12-26 02:42:19 Stocks under a cloud as U.S. political tumult adds to growth anxiety
3269 2018-12-26 02:42:16 It was said that stocks would tank if the dems took the house....
3270 2018-12-26 02:42:05 Buy oil at 40 (wti) , oil stocks, if the US does attack Iran you'll be millionaire. lol
3271 2018-12-26 02:41:32 And yet the giant cheeto that just banned bump stocks and still hasn't built a wall is the "extremist." 

I mean, can you see how we might have some confusion on this point?

3279 2018-12-26 02:37:51 GOP blows up the deficit via tax cuts, Fed responds by tightening aggressively, stocks tank, Trump loses the majority of his Cabinet, Government shuts down over a stupid wall, but it’s the Treasury secretary’s fault so get rid of him too. Why don’t GOP want to 25th this guy?
3280 2018-12-26 02:37:41 When Trump leaves , the economy will rebound, stocks will go up, and we will have real trade with nations.
3281 2018-12-26 02:37:37 The Government should come down very hard on the middlemen and conduct raids on their stocks and finances at regular intervels.

3289 2018-12-26 02:32:40 I have never been a Jim Cramer hater. I think the guy is a better investor than the haters give him credit for and I always like to hear what he thinks about markets and stocks. I couldn't agree more with his Christmas Eve comments:
3290 2018-12-26 02:31:53 good for my penny stocks $nouv $dksc
3291 2018-12-26 02:31:05 Our stocks are in the tank, our healthcare (your plan, not Obama’s) is higher than ever, more gun violence than any other nation....oh, and we will be missing our next few paychecks!  You’re a disgrace. #ResignTrump
3292 2018-12-26 02:30:53 The reason I shorted $roku was because it didn’t rally post Thanksgiving along with many other tech stocks. To me that was a sign it was seriously ill.

I’m going to use this approach as my yardstick for truly dead stocks. I hate nothing worse than shorting and having it turn.

3296 2018-12-26 02:29:06 I think amidst the American meltdown Indian story still looking good. Benign interest rates and good growth rates should work for us. We should stock away quality stocks and hope for a turnaround.
3297 2018-12-26 02:29:03 I believe Business News Channels should do a review of their 2018 new year picks before dashing into bringing a new set of stocks. Analyst who suggested them should explain what needs to be done, if they still see them as multibaggers, this will bring more credibility. Your views
3298 2018-12-26 02:28:18 In the Las Vegas airport. The last time I was here was the day after the mass shooting. It was heartbreaking. If I have to give Trump credit for one thing, it’s banning bump-stocks.
3299 2018-12-26 02:28:01 we actually have reason to believe what we believe. You just hate trump. November elections? Mattis? Bear market? Is that the best you guys have

3301 2018-12-26 02:25:23 They’re WAY overreaching.  They never even threatened this much with tobacco.  And yes, they do have an agenda. I mean the damn Surgeon General has 3 fixing tobacco stocks!
3302 2018-12-26 02:25:14 Stocks and bonds ratio rule, my frienda
3303 2018-12-26 02:24:29 Happy holidays Senator @SenKamalaHarris! Question: isnt there a law against manipulating stocks and such? And for personal gain, to boot? Seems like that's what DJT and Mnuchin are doing purposfully w their bank calls and Fed tweet rants. Bringing down the market on purpose. 
3304 2018-12-26 02:23:28 Worst December for stocks in almost 90 years—since the Great Depression. Fake news? MAGA?
3305 2018-12-26 02:23:28 Your policies are destroying my retirement stocks.
3306 2018-12-26 02:23:17 When Trump was elected, I moved my 401K to all bonds. While I’ve still lost some coin, the losses have been mitigated. Only info I retained from my college Economics class was to buy bonds in a bad economy. I knew Trump would bankrupt the US and that stocks would drop sharply.
3307 2018-12-26 02:22:48 Let's not forget the stock market. It is planning on open 350 points down. This is at the opening bell. Asia stocks are tanking because of us.
3308 2018-12-26 02:22:12 They were the real bubble all along - 'sustainable financial institutions' is a misnomer when they need to be bailed out every ten years; stocks are mispriced based on their valuation being based on a balance sheet which is mostly rooted in tax havens etc
3309 2018-12-26 02:22:01 Im sick all my stocks took a drastic hit lmao just gotta let them marinate until the stock market bounce back again
3310 2018-12-26 02:21:53 Statistically I won't live long enough for my stocks to recover.  But I'm in good company with many Americans.
3311 2018-12-26 02:20:29 Every time stocks fluctuate we are reminded of the Great Depression and Wall Street Crash. And now we have the added fear of Trump causing everything bad in the world.
3312 2018-12-26 02:18:58 Oh I would buy all the stocks... but for my derbs... no regulation thank you I trust my boy lol

3318 2018-12-26 02:14:29 stocks down 20%; mine down 9%, but it's still not pretty.

3332 2018-12-26 02:07:05 Buying your Mom a car is all good if that’s something she needs, but I hope buying stocks or even a house was done first. Better to increase wealth than to buy something that depreciates the minute that you use it. 
3333 2018-12-26 02:06:51 Get a clue how the economy works.   = WRONG.  It was riding before Trump took office, just like stocks.
3334 2018-12-26 02:06:30 Di ko talaga kinakaya. Ubos yung stocks sa oxygen kahapon
3335 2018-12-26 02:06:09 Stocks
3336 2018-12-26 02:05:44 You're ignorant. If you are a participant in the stock market or the economy, you have risks no matter who you are. The stocks are practically controlled by government, so stop blaming Trump because it obviously not his fault. It's the government's fault.
3337 2018-12-26 02:03:36 Lol stocks have fallen hate crimes are up and govt is closed.......
3338 2018-12-26 02:03:28 You have to hold some of it in stocks when you retire because you  have a few decades yet to live. No fixed rate cash vehicles are going to earn enough in that period to keep the average guy solvent til death.
3339 2018-12-26 02:02:49 A-hole. You ever hear of "Buy Low - Sell High"? You think investing is about buying stocks at record Highs?

3354 2018-12-26 01:54:02 The "permit" to own an auto is a $200 tax.... They are expensive because the supply available to the general public was closed in 1986. If you want bump stocks gone, the proper way to do so is legislation.

3357 2018-12-26 01:52:27 No letting corporations keep more of their money to buy up their own stocks did. Trickle down economics only works for those that r supposed to be trickling it down. Then everyone else gets caught holding the bag. Smh #taxscamtankedeconomy

3362 2018-12-26 01:49:22 Semantics. Most stocks already in a bear market. As gundlach said, bear market is just an arbitrary thing. Brat market is more of a mentality than a threshold.
3363 2018-12-26 01:48:55 Seems like ETF selling has created pretty good ops in single stocks. Galaxy brain stuff I know
3364 2018-12-26 01:48:06 Oh yeah our country is doing great. Stocks keep nose diving and border Patrol keeps killing children. But Merry Christmas to all the faux Christians.
3365 2018-12-26 01:46:02 it should be easier for the everyday person to invest in stocks
3366 2018-12-26 01:45:36 I appreciate the low gas prices - but my stocks losing 50% of their value ain’t cool.

3372 2018-12-26 01:39:41 What does Trump have to do with Mass shootings??? He just banned bump stocks which is more then Obama ever did. #TrumpDerangementSyndrome
3373 2018-12-26 01:39:25 The markets will continue their downward trends. Even though stocks are fundamentally strong. Peoples confidence in the economy is falling.
3374 2018-12-26 01:37:37 That's back when Pump Stocks were legal 
3375 2018-12-26 01:37:05 The negative market reaction to Dem control of house and Fed interest rate hikes is caused by their combined projected impact on valuation of future cash flows of public traded company stocks. The reverse applied to Trump win.

3377 2018-12-26 01:36:13 That is giving your gifts to the man!  The cash-out kiosks will offer you maybe $17 for a $25 gift card.  Plus, they mine your data; a mobile number, state ID, credit card, and email address is required in order to be ripped-off of 30%+ of the value.  Hope those are hot stocks!
3378 2018-12-26 01:36:03 Have you seen their stocks? The gaming industry is literally crashing....
3379 2018-12-26 01:34:56 Nope. Programs like Mad Money have been shilling stocks for decades.

They alway shill the top, and tell you to dump and run at the bottom.... Crypto, stocks, forex,.... Everything
3380 2018-12-26 01:34:23 Yes we are doing great, the entire B team is in the White House and stocks have a net loss for the year. #winning

3382 2018-12-26 01:33:06 Hulk i been looking to buy some apple stocks but little scared about this bear marker plus vix is at $36 now 
3383 2018-12-26 01:32:15 Well I have try to do the maths and ~39% of the household own 90k (average) of stocks & 10% of them own 2m (average) on stocks.
3384 2018-12-26 01:32:13 what stocks are good
3385 2018-12-26 01:32:10 Funny the stocks markets started going down as soon as we learned the Democrats got the house back, coincidence? I don't think so.
3386 2018-12-26 01:32:00 I agree. My stocks tanked, i stopped spending weeks ago fearful of crash. My elderly parents reeling from losses, I have 2 kids in college we lost part of their 529s. I know many people working 2 or 3 jobs wages R stagnant & 4 first year since ACA we all can't afford insurance
3387 2018-12-26 01:31:05 For Christmas, I bought all of my little cousins private prison stocks and explained that they are all now complicit with profiting from a racist system and the suffering of their fellow man. Now that they have some skin in the game, let’s see who they’ll choose to be
3388 2018-12-26 01:31:04 One of my buddies has a lot of money and was buying everything near the 2009 bottom. I kept telling him that the companies would go bankrupt take the 20-30% profits when they hit. Lol. He held and did well. Stocks were trading like options with no expiration.
3389 2018-12-26 01:30:45 Stocks, DOW, & Wall Street are at the lowest EVER, even over the Great Depression, b/c U R so freakin incompetent. Businessman? The only business you can handle is what comes out of you into the toilet.  UR wall WON'T happen, & it's NOT democrats. Wanker. UR base is leaving U.
3390 2018-12-26 01:30:29 The fact that M is calling banks is going to kill stocks to halfway back to Bush.
3391 2018-12-26 01:30:16 The dude seemed so confident going in with stocks trailing obamas terms, now nothing is going his way and hes focused on a wall thatll do nothing for us...
3392 2018-12-26 01:28:52 People are too freaking emotional, hope will destroy them.

Stocks are crashing and they think the crypto bear market is over!! Doesn't make any damn sense.
3393 2018-12-26 01:28:49 They get drunk and talk stocks. This move was the right move.
3394 2018-12-26 01:27:01 The government shut down is fucking with my stocks
3395 2018-12-26 01:26:14 And our stocks are tanking, you’ve shut down the government and leaving room for Russia and China to become more powerful on the world stage.
3396 2018-12-26 01:25:24 Don't buy property guys.Those markets are really bubbled and they will come down sooner or later.Sell those propertys high and invest that in new industry.Same goes with stocks too. Cars & Jets wont hold value either
Invest in Precious Metals or Crypto.BTC just bottomed.Think
3397 2018-12-26 01:24:47 And stocks in which they invest managed by Vanguard, Black Rock, BoA, State Street, et. al. - primary investors in Raytheon, Lockheed, Boeing, Exxon Mobil, et. al. Guess who buys THAT stock? Everyone, but especially media. #war4profit
3398 2018-12-26 01:24:36 Lol. Seriously. Like asking to short stocks, after the fact!
3399 2018-12-26 01:24:26 If you put a gun to my head, I’d buy stocks too. Notice the China PPT bought mostly financials. Same thing happened in USA in early March ‘09. Coincidence? I don’t think so..
3400 2018-12-26 01:24:23 these naive funds will find out how miscalculated they were the commie wants them to pump the stocks
3401 2018-12-26 01:23:45 @CallOfDutyUnite how the fuck is 3 armor more rare now EVERYTIME i die its to someone wearing 3 armor??? something is very wrong and unbalanced fix ur crap ass game. no wounder ur stocks dropped 50%
3402 2018-12-26 01:22:01 Ben had 11 points on 12 shooting possessions, 4 turnovers, 0 stocks, and was a -17
3403 2018-12-26 01:21:24 @IKEACASupport About your 15% sale on today, IRW834 message keeps showing up on payment and doesn't process my order. Also, the store has enough stock of an item (it says online), but when I try to proceed the purchase, it says out of stock (still saying in stocks online)
3404 2018-12-26 01:21:06 Your superficial research does not do you any credit. You should see through manufactured crap. You are winning on any shorts on US stocks right now because Trump has single handedly driven down the whole US market.
3405 2018-12-26 01:20:49 You can not sell stocks until you buy them, also if you have forgotten dividends
3406 2018-12-26 01:20:43 Bargain one-way fares? Is it me or are they stacking the bulldust higher than ever? Who buys a one-way ticket for a holiday?

3408 2018-12-26 01:19:38 Seeing so many ads for legal marijuana stocks makes it seem like such a pump and dump, like some of those shill crypto projects. There are better ways to subtly attract investors.
3409 2018-12-26 01:19:16 Did they buy pot stocks?
3410 2018-12-26 01:18:35 He doesnt own stocks he never did
3411 2018-12-26 01:18:22 How opportunist the demons are.  When the stock market went up after election was not Mr Trump responsible.  Now went down is his fault.  Stocks are like a business they going up and downs
3412 2018-12-26 01:17:35 Guess that's my thing. I gave you for the stocks, that'll come in handy.  No big deal.
3413 2018-12-26 01:17:01 Stocks do that; you are aware of how that works, right...criticism comes after it STAYS that way for oh......8 years or so.....
3414 2018-12-26 01:16:26 Fake News Media has thrown almost everything they have at Trump to get him out of office. Get ready for some news meant to make stocks fall. That’s their only way they succeed in avoiding a Trump 2020 win.
3415 2018-12-26 01:16:09 Country is doing very well except for basically anyone that has stocks, bonds, funds, etc...
3416 2018-12-26 01:16:01 We went from getting socks for Christmas 
To taking stocks for Christmas

3421 2018-12-26 01:13:14 Wells Fargo employees retirement plan defaults to buying all Wells Fargo stock. September of 2017 I had a few switch to an S&P 500 index fund. Wells Fargo has since fell 20% while the S&P fund has fallen 8%. #stocks #retirementplanning #indexfunds #sandp
3422 2018-12-26 01:10:21 My guess is 100% of Congress has "fossil fuel" stocks in their portfolios.

Why don't YOU GUYS ask them, for the record, eh?
3423 2018-12-26 01:10:07 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
3424 2018-12-26 01:09:58 It’s not just “rich people” who invest in the stock market. 

But dumbass liberals think that only the mythical “white wall street man” has anything invested in the stock market so therefor the dip in stocks is a “rich white person problem.” Idiots.
3425 2018-12-26 01:09:53 1) falling growth expectations have impacted oil 
2) 30 year UST are down on the year and up only 6.9% since low and stocks are down 20%.  Bonds protected 
from loss if instead of a 60/40 allocation you had a 25/75 allocation
Fed  is restrictive all assets down
3426 2018-12-26 01:07:46 Yes the Govt are getting pharmacies to stockpile meds for 6 weeks post Brexit as more than 50% made in other EU countries and there will be border hold ups, some are dependent on insulin and stocks could run out. Check it online.
3427 2018-12-26 01:06:54 Love the way you can't even be human on Christmas. Our country is headed into inflation then recession thanks to you. The Obama economy you enjoyed and took credit for is ending. The Trump destruction is starting to hit. First with the thing that always shows first. The stocks.
3428 2018-12-26 01:05:15 If stocks go down, it means its time to buy. A lot of stocks have reached 52 week low, great buying sign.
3429 2018-12-26 01:04:50 People Make Money SELLING STOCKS on #WallStreet ~ NOT Buying Them...What Part of THAT Did Your Broker Not Tell You...? #msnbc #foxnews #nytimes #cnn #wsj #cnbc #politico #huffpost #drudge #bbc #gop #npr #dailykos #thehill #wapo #nbc #cbs #aarp #401k #fed #eu #g7 #g20 #ecb
3430 2018-12-26 01:03:07 If stocks continue to dive head first, I think we'll see volume in the Crypto space. The wall street crew will need a 'safe haven' for their funds. Hopefully this theory proves to be correct.
3431 2018-12-26 01:02:52 #Trump has recommended buying US stocks, saying it’s a good opportunity with the dip. Next, he is going to recommend exactly which companies to buy!!
3432 2018-12-26 01:02:41 @realDonaldTrump When you said you would defend our 2nd Amendment rights I thought you actually meant it.  Now you ban bump stocks?  I guess I was wrong to believe you.
3433 2018-12-26 01:01:44 Global stocks under a cloud as U.S. political uncertainty adds to growth fears
3434 2018-12-26 01:01:14 Will we see a low $3k #bitcoin price again? Maybe... but I wouldn't expect sub-3k with the way stocks and fiat have been going 
3435 2018-12-26 01:00:24 Stocks crashing, ppl getting laid off, new recession starting, 800k fed workers can't get their paychecks, children dying in the hands of Boarder Patrol... is that what winning looks like?
3436 2018-12-26 00:59:22 Never considered going long. My watch list was all short for the day. All stocks opened up below support / my entry. Didn’t know how to trade it.
3437 2018-12-26 00:58:13 I'm new at this... most recent window gets filled and creates weakness. Then second most recent window gets filled and sets up HS top. Then stocks rally to ATH? Right?! 

My 401k is so effing underwater.
3438 2018-12-26 00:58:06 How have alt coins done compared to stocks? Facts are facts.
3439 2018-12-26 00:58:04 Shocked at how many young people I speak to who think a savings account is a better long term investment strategy than stocks.
3440 2018-12-26 00:57:43 Uhhhh that orange fucktard has been taking credit for the stocks for 2 years 
3441 2018-12-26 00:57:24 If you are a young person (35 and under) who considers yourself a long term investor, you should already be buying stocks/index funds as of last week. Returns are outsized on 5, 10, 20 year time frames when you buy 15% drops off highs. They get even more outsized the lower we go.
3442 2018-12-26 00:56:36 Maybe they like that insane pressure to be able to speed run stocks in 4 minutes or less
3443 2018-12-26 00:55:52 I’m not dumb enough to put my $ in stocks. It’s a crapshoot! I’d rather put it under my mattress. 
Actually it’s in cds and gift annuities. Safe!
3444 2018-12-26 00:55:38 Tomorrow is the last day for tax loss. Its going to be volatile as usual, many will dump but many will also pick up the boxing day cheap stocks sales

3446 2018-12-26 00:54:29 Stocks are dropping just like your teammates.
3447 2018-12-26 00:53:57 I just want to win some GSP and i keep getting matched with some assholes with 2 stocks and hazards on
3448 2018-12-26 00:53:33 Snowflakes are beautiful. The economy is doing beautifully now, isn't it. Stocks are up. More people employed than ever. Hooray for rump.
3449 2018-12-26 00:53:18 Ok, I got no problems with it when viewed in terms of asset allocation, i.e put more into bonds as values & ratios rise & less into stocks. Many folk preach CAPE to be the best predictor of stock valuations, it is far from perfect, a combination of ratios is ok to rely on.

3453 2018-12-26 00:51:46 Clothes, socks, and money in stocks for Christmas this year... woooo!
3454 2018-12-26 00:49:46 Implied open for stocks now flat. Who knows, maybe will be up 500 by morning. lol
3455 2018-12-26 00:49:08 minnasan i'm wheezing why is e trading stocks
3456 2018-12-26 00:48:55 Stocks are on sale! 30% off!*

*(The discounted price is probably the right price. When tech companies with zero profits were valued higher than blue chips with billions in profits AND billions in hard assets, we clearly had a bubble.)
3457 2018-12-26 00:47:34 All the millionaire / billionaire democrats are short selling their stocks, just speculation as I have no proof. But come on, what else could it be. Money or the stock market doesn't magically go up or down, it takes monetary transactions.
3458 2018-12-26 00:47:25 At the same time, you must be disappointed with Trump. He's taking away everyone's health care , shrinking the economy, and for the NRA, taking away bump stocks for guns. Trump also lies to everyone because he thinks his fan base is gullible and in a way, you're proof of that.
3459 2018-12-26 00:47:11 Well done sir.  I too refuse to make a gumbo without homemade stocks.
3460 2018-12-26 00:46:49 34 year-old JJ Redick is the Sixers’ only reliable source of quality half-court offense. I’d sell all of my 76ers playoff stocks if I still had any

3466 2018-12-26 00:41:13 When the stocks were good I heard all demorats say it was obimbo a market. Now it’s trumps really sad that now it’s his. Smh
3467 2018-12-26 00:40:50 The people that have bought stocks because you’ve been advertising it every time it peaked are going to see their portfolio-value decrease quicker that the value of any cryptocurrency.
3468 2018-12-26 00:38:59 According to my nephew, we need to be investing in “poop and babies” instead of stocks and derivatives. He’s five.
3469 2018-12-26 00:38:41 Markets go up, and markets go down. When Fed raises interest rates, it almost always hurts stocks. Obama never had to deal with this. Market will recover. It always has
3470 2018-12-26 00:38:12 He is right, when the market is down, time to buy solid stocks.

- worst Christmas eve ever for stocks
- government is shut down

3507 2018-12-26 00:11:00 Worst in history. Worst ever on record. Sent stocks into a tailspin. Took paychecks from hard workers for nothing but a tantrum. Kids are dying under this admin. Under investigation. Making independent military moves that make SecDef quit. Get this trash traitor out of office now
3508 2018-12-26 00:10:51 Daum. 50 stocks ×_×
3509 2018-12-26 00:10:49 About True Wealth BUY STOCKS! DON'T SELL!
3510 2018-12-26 00:10:33 If nobody wants US stocks at the moment and they keep falling, that's a problem but not a catastrophe. 

If suddenly nobody wants U.S. Treasury bonds because the world fears a madman occupies the White House, *that* would be a catastrophe.
3511 2018-12-26 00:10:19 I did lose money because I was planning on selling stocks the end of the year to finish up a remodel on my house, to increase the value and fund additional projects outside of the market.  Waiting for 2 years or so for them to go up again will continue to mean I lose money
3512 2018-12-26 00:10:15 A Bump stock is not a gun and not owning it has nothing to do with your 2nd Amendment rights. The NRA supported the ban on the bump stocks and pushed for it.
3513 2018-12-26 00:09:58 How much are stocks up for the year?
3514 2018-12-26 00:09:18 By the way, I don’t follow why you have no way of moving out of the stock market. Does your 401k not have non-stock choices? In general, younger people should have a higher percentage allocated to stocks than people who need to tap it soon.
3515 2018-12-26 00:09:04 Millenials should stop buying stocks outright, boomers can sell them to Fed. This is still not madness, how a 5% down can be madness?
3516 2018-12-26 00:08:58 Buy buy buy... stocks are on sale!
3517 2018-12-26 00:08:41 I think that another 10% to 20% decline is therefore feasible but if it turns out to no recession just slows earnings growth in 2019 stocks will bounce back. In any case I think with that level of downside and at reasonable valuation makes sense to increase equity allocations.
3518 2018-12-26 00:08:35 I been checking all my stocks all day and shit been going up and down like a mf
3519 2018-12-26 00:08:22 Quancy, you haven't lost the money unless you sold the stocks. Like I told my family, never try to catch a falling knife! We all need to sit tight. The market will correct eventually. And hopefully Mueller will have enough on the orange moron to get rid of him. 
3520 2018-12-26 00:07:50 I started moving my stocks and retirement out of the market.  I have a feeling it will be challenged for the next two years and will continue to go lower.  I can always jump back in when things get better (i.e. if the dems win in 2020)
3521 2018-12-26 00:07:34 Trade, Stocks Your Life its All Fuk 
3522 2018-12-26 00:06:53 "Maybe. But it definitely won't do well for the company stocks."
3523 2018-12-26 00:06:32 On the cool you’re gonna have to teach me stocks 101
3524 2018-12-26 00:05:56 the govt is down . so the stocks aren’t doing well .. thanks to trump
3525 2018-12-26 00:05:18 Have a read of some of my blog articles. I think I present a pretty sound argument. But I still think that maybe with some time, and if we can get something going with the farm bill (maybe more legalization), then stocks could go up. Don't see any other way, though.
3526 2018-12-26 00:04:30 I have no idea where stocks will go from here, but the tax loss harvesting “opportunities” presented over the past few weeks certainly aren’t going to be a tailwind through year end.
3527 2018-12-26 00:04:28 If you ever come upstate western new york I would like to buy u a beer and talk stocks lol come to Rochester!
3528 2018-12-26 00:04:04 I lost 100k in 2008.  And now I'm about 10 years from retirement, I can't bring myself to look.  I hate that my retirement is tied to stocks.
3529 2018-12-26 00:03:48 bump stocks are not guns ;) The NRA supports the banning of those btw and not having one does not violate your 2nd Amendment right.
3530 2018-12-26 00:02:11 How to identify stocks to trade with this strategy?
3531 2018-12-26 00:01:00 Not sure about you but I lost $1000s in my stocks and retirement account this last week bc of Trump and the @GOP.  I have only lost ground in all areas since this Administration started. 

And the next two years are going to be even worse (for all of us). 
3532 2018-12-26 00:00:46 Bitch, stick to Smash 4, and losing by 4 stocks
3533 2018-12-26 00:00:25 Stocks have had the worst December since the Great Depression thanks to you.
We don’t need closed borders or closed minds like yours.
Now resign, you goon.
