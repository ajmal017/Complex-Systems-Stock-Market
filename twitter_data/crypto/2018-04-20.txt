1 2018-04-20 23:59:51 #FlashbackFriday to when @Follow2TheMoney @Stock_Diva @ElenaVK  were pounding the table on $eth at $60 last year. Woooo great trading, thankful I learned from some of the best #Ethereum #Crypto

14 2018-04-20 23:57:35 There is no bull like a #crypto bull.
15 2018-04-20 23:57:18 thanks for responding I was hoping Crypto would answer though. on the other hand, TY for your honesty and some have destroyed them instead of selling them. Sad thing is that responsible gun ownership can not be legislated ugh
16 2018-04-20 23:57:10 Sir i am new crypto  i subscribe like video and retweet.....
17 2018-04-20 23:57:09 And back to 50 cents "lower than the pre ico price" so instead of trying to pump it to this poor fella tell him how this coin has done no growth instead

19 2018-04-22 23:59:33 This has been going on for decades...Banks do it with Govt backing. What can people do other than wait.
20 2018-04-22 23:59:27 remember if you cant catch em all, take 1k do 20% trades with that 40x and there you go, you have 1m. #crypto #altcoins
21 2018-04-22 23:59:14 Nice RR
22 2018-04-22 23:59:13 The entire #Crypto market now giving back. 
I urge #RiskManagement and #CapitalConservation once again.
#Cryptocurrencies are currently seeking supports:::No Play

The biggest runner has been #ETHEREUM which I will use as example::::

25 2018-04-22 23:58:41 wouldn't doubt if it doubled in a week or 2. Still so so so many doubters on crypto

27 2018-04-22 23:58:24 On a serious note have you looked at travelblock? I know other are out there but this one looks amazing prices on everything are ridiculous cheap and once mainstream hears about it. Well hello crypto

29 2018-04-22 23:58:10 Hey Crypto_Legit thanks for the follow!
30 2018-04-22 23:58:07 Awesome, another daily update on crypto news, makes my life easier!
31 2018-04-22 23:58:05 ボク、世界史で、それより点数低かった……
32 2018-04-22 23:57:39 If @SF_SEC doesn't deem Ether a security.

That'll create a perverse inventive for every ICO to get high powered lawyers and VCs that have a stake to lobby the SEC for an exemption.

This is bad both for the future of decentralized crypto and the integrity of US regulators.

He REALLY

REALLY wants us to learn
36 2018-04-21 23:59:46 Even though $icx is regarded as Korean $eth, no Korean shopper I’ve spoken with has even heard of it yet...
37 2018-04-21 23:59:22 good video
38 2018-04-21 23:59:12 Something very interesting going on in the market right now. #staywoke #crypto
39 2018-04-21 23:59:10 This actually created lots of problems for me this year. Add a holiday and time for checks to clear and it can be 5 days just to get "your own" money.
40 2018-04-21 23:59:02 I love when the #crypto experts talk about risk management and risk/reward ratio but they do not believe in using stop losses. 
41 2018-04-21 23:58:52 The difference is that in the case of $ you are forced to use something you have no control over. It’s this asymmetry that crypto people decry.
42 2018-04-21 23:58:44 Which universities have the best research programs/labs about crypto-economics? Other than @MIT_Cryptoecon

51 2018-04-21 23:57:18 I've been in the crypto game for 1 hour.  It aligns well with my need to gamble.
52 2018-04-21 23:57:11 #BUIDL #Blockchain Yes there is something worse.  Having your bank block you from moving your money out of your account to buy #Crypto after 30+ years with them.
53 2018-04-21 23:56:28 I would like to know details about the experience
