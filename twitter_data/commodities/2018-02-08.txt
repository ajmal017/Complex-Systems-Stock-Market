36 2018-02-08 22:24:44 Equities volatility and market sell off - caused systemic risk in commodities, all metals and energy now falling.  This is confirmation of RISK OFF across all assets, with the exception of GOLD. This is normal outcome. #asx #asx200 #ausbiz #stocks
37 2018-02-08 22:23:02 In 2008, EVERYTHING went down and continued down as people got margin called out of their commodities etc. Bonds got bought with Fed bailout, but that’s not happening on that level now so I think everything can continue down simultaneously here. I agree it probably won’t though.

42 2018-02-08 22:14:02 So you clearly don’t understand the concept of “hangover”. This is when the excessive wages increases experienced during the boom became unsustainable during the correction/transition away from commodities. In addition, those jobs where skills are in demand are seeing good rises.

50 2018-02-08 21:57:01 US wages are up. Ours will follow as we transition out of the commodities boom. We’re also dealing with the hangover of excessively high wages paid during the boom. We had catching up to do. It’s simple economics which Shorten and Bowen used to understand 5 years ago.
51 2018-02-08 21:51:50 Prior to food stamps, people receive commodities...  they were government issued cheese and canned goods. With all the abuse of food stamps, the government should go back to issuing commodities to the truly needy. It's a lot cheaper and less abusive!

69 2018-02-08 21:03:35 It’s a pre-industrial structure of labor while commodities and resources are tightly restricted and concentrated using the help of industrial technology, from a wider pool (so MORE people are being starved out of subsistence). The worst of both worlds.

77 2018-02-08 20:28:00 The "inflation cycle" turns 9 years old, next month...  

The money that is printed is chasing paper assets instead of goods.... the Central Banks advertise this, it is not a secret. That's why you get the inflation in assets (including commodities) and not incomes or goods.

84 2018-02-08 20:03:58 At the end of the day, mining pools are commodities, the cost of switching to another pool is very low. If you are unhappy with the PPLNS payout structure, we recommend giving SiaMining a try. PPLNS, has a lower fee structure so higher payouts in the long run, but more variance.

89 2018-02-08 19:31:40 This feels like hairsplitting. US equities are measured re: USD, and many commodities, and FX. If USD generally rises against all/most of these we say USD got stronger.

94 2018-02-08 19:15:04 looks like market sell of has a positive effect on MJ stocks, its a commodity after all and commodities usually do good during a market correction..imo alot of money might get moved into #potstocks in the shortterm from other equities;

96 2018-02-08 19:00:36 Thanks for being openminded and willing to give blockchain a fair shot. I do think a lot of these tokens are similar to commodities, so you may be able to relate and connect to them better than others.
97 2018-02-08 18:57:00 Markets are bleeding again !! Commodities are holding even with the USD show of strength
98 2018-02-08 18:56:19 We'll likely see a rate hike from The FED FOMC in March 2018. Economic data coming out of the US will almost surely demand it...yields on US Treasury Bonds will keep rising. Stocks will continue to "correct". Global growth outlook still positive. Commodities still best bet.

106 2018-02-08 18:36:56 The prices of all commodities are rising not because the intrinsic value of it but more so the lack of value in the dollar. Understanding this is crucial to grasp where our economy is headed.

114 2018-02-08 18:04:45 Yup. And leader @AmandaMDuffy gets it honest. When she ran @loucityfc here, she treated customers like commodities. Another “the beautiful business” > “the beautiful game” robot, probably has a motivational poster of @soccerkcarter on the office wall.
115 2018-02-08 18:03:59 For the @Lakers that depends on the endgame. For the @Cavs you probably do that 100 times in 100. A late first can yield good results, as we've seen, but Clarkson and Nance are known commodities that really don't mortgage this season. The dropoff isn't so big because of injury.

173 2018-02-08 14:18:12 It has more to do more with how traditional institutions look at commodities. Like an endowment wouldn't even look at $BTC as a possible investment under some, admittedly, arbitrary threshold. These are slow behemoths and they probably still wouldn't invest in it at $100B.

183 2018-02-08 13:30:40 You say 10% decline (but we have already declined such an amount from the peak). So you expect sideways and some down movement for 3-6 months especially in commodities and EM. Then when inflation picks up in Q2 a continuation of the reflation trend.

221 2018-02-08 09:38:04 Like, to put it another way, all forward movement is produced by some sort of force, but not all force produces forward movement, You could, for example, apply force to a wall and the wall would stay in place. So to is the connection between the value of commodities and labor.
222 2018-02-08 09:38:00 The other problem is that they're getting things backwards. To Marx, the value of all commodities is produced by labor, but the mudpie argument acts as if he's saying all labor produces value for commodities.

259 2018-02-08 06:16:34 I am not a social activist. Just an everyday common man. I was getting some fuel at the gas station a few days ago and was shocked by the prices. Interesting how "ache din" translated into exorbitant rates for commodities. #india2018 #bjplies #politics #PoliticsOverPeople

264 2018-02-08 05:56:14 @askGSTech In e way bill portal, cess is fixed by percentage based on base price but on some commodities it is based on quantity. so while generating e way bill we have to put cess amount manually??
265 2018-02-08 05:54:39 Funny how the ownership of basic commodities such as bread water and minerals etc has nothing to do with the Guptas, but these commodities are owned by the same people that own the media as well .

268 2018-02-08 05:37:18 More than regressive, it is so sexist as if women are only good for display, their bodies some commodities on display. And I could see as how men would ogle at these women and try to touch them too.
269 2018-02-08 05:36:08 Black people, don’t be fooled by all the inclusion. We are still commodities
270 2018-02-08 05:18:38  If the US wants to regulate, go ahead. But leave the rest of the world alone, we don't want it. Free market should be volatile and risky, not controlled with regulation. There is always commodities and PM's if you want 20% over 20 yrs. Let crypto be wild a free

276 2018-02-08 04:44:03 #Commodities - The Rand continues to be the best performer in the world against the dollar as President Zuma’s resignation draws closer.

It is currently 1.5% stronger at R11.93 against dollar.
277 2018-02-08 04:40:09 So I browsed the Trump store, um I've gotten better gifts from random salesman just to have five minutes of my time. I've even gotten better gifts on a public golf course for mixing up tee times. Looks like abc distributing/LTD Commodities  knockoffs.
278 2018-02-08 04:37:52 Is it fair to say, the jump in imports is helped by China buying large amount of commodities in addition to the working day effect.
279 2018-02-08 04:11:27 Unlike other commodities wine has a connection to most people: it brings us together, we celebrate w/ it, we commiserate with it. We romanticize it. Weaponizing wine has created a huge dialogue.  #BCWineChat

284 2018-02-08 03:47:30 I thought that $XLE would get a bid in a growing economy and Trump being pro oil and all, driving the Dow even higher and commodities would do good as well as markets and the economy. Apparently they continue to beat on commodities and investors are frightened of inflation

292 2018-02-08 03:00:38 i'm not here to explain to you why you should do anything.  dyor

before people hoarded crypto, they hoarded stocks, before that tradeable commodities, before that precious metals, before that spices, before that people.  

people hoard shit was @Socal_crypto's point lol.

306 2018-02-08 01:02:34 Correlation between commodities and stocks are all over the place.    Possible drops caused by concerns about more Fed rate hikes (to tame inflation - rate hikes can hold down commodity prices as well).

315 2018-02-08 00:26:44 The acorn was a random example.  But I’m sure someone in this big, crazy world has that much more money that sense.  The point still stands.
