7 2019-03-27 23:52:11 Damn @Converse, I own 12 pairs of Chucks (even grabbed some customs from LA when I was over there). Tried to replenish stocks and told the Chuck II was EOL. It solved the tongue sliding problem and had a more comfortable sole as I have a metal rod in my leg. What can replace ‘em?
8 2019-03-27 23:51:23 Some of these stocks lately just open high. 
Now how do you know which ones to buy that will just open high one day? 
We can all just wake up green and sell #ASX . Wake up in profit. I am yet to experience it .

15 2019-03-27 23:48:01 This is a complaint thread. 
1. Nintendo you have no excuse for such a shitty fucking online. Your smash matchmaking is so bad that whoever thought of it should be fired. If I ask for 7 minute, 3 stock, Battlefield, no itrms. Don’t fucking give me 2 stocks, 7 minutes, and FD.
16 2019-03-27 23:47:59 @ShimanoOZ Why is it so difficult to find a local retailer that stocks the XC7 or XC9 shoes in anything other than black?
17 2019-03-27 23:46:16 Martha Stewart never makes a bad decision, she will carry canopy to the stratosphere baby. Buy buy buy. Sell everything you have and buy Canopy stocks bro.
