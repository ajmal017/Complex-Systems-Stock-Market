34 2018-04-29 23:23:52 Having such a high number of positions doesn’t work for many people, as most active traders are taught to hold between 5 and 20 stocks at a time. I found that to work better on a shorter time frame, from a few days to a few months.
35 2018-04-29 23:21:53 @mjekm5 only bad things happen under the 200 day. I don’t buy stocks under it and I’m quick to sell stocks that break it #investing #trading #TomsTruths

41 2018-04-29 23:10:20  I did the same thing I gave up on waiting for them to be a crypto exchange, so I cashed out the stocks they gave me for referrals to buy crypto
42 2018-04-29 23:09:12 Also of interest at least to me is the differential between the big 4 Canadian bank stocks trading on the TSX which of course shut down at 1:30pm on Friday and the same Canadian bank stocks listed on US xchanges which ran as usual till 4pm. RY 0.45%, BNS 0.54%, BMO 0.3%, TD 0.1%
43 2018-04-29 23:09:06 Doc certainly does have the kill power to take g&w's stocks earlier then vice versa but that would be ignoring the fact that g&w has a fantastic edgeguard game that coupled with docs bad recovery allows him to more often then not gimp him everytime he hits him offstage.

47 2018-04-29 23:04:05 At Milken Global: @principal global investment strategist Seema Shah tells @IBDinvestors that US #stocks can still rise even if Treasury 10-year bond yields hit 3.25% by year-end, so long as #economy continues to grow. Tax cuts help offset more rate hikes #MIGlobal #investing
48 2018-04-29 22:57:48 As a very green trader it's easy to get caught up in the hype when traders are pushing their stocks hard.  Has been interesting to see swami and linewiper do their thing, a refreshing point of view.  Great way to knock me back down a few notches.
49 2018-04-29 22:54:28 True but isn’t what a company earned last year usually a good proxy for what it will earn next year? And if the market were really discounting future earnings, shouldn’t we have seen multiple compression in stocks like amazon and netflix as they grew?
50 2018-04-29 22:53:27 I think the scale of the attack, if the reports are true, is waaaaay bigger than anything before, reports of huge stocks of rockets destroyed, 40-60 people killed, etc. Last time it was 17 Iranian deaths and that was huge, this is even bigger by those standards.
51 2018-04-29 22:52:38 Wonder if that would hold true if value were defined by an enterprise multiple - tho that raises problems of handling financials, which I'd argue have spent long stretches as "value" stocks but will have totally wacky EBIT/EVs

57 2018-04-29 22:44:30 That was the thinking at the time (& not entirely without reason), which is why Hood, in the end, wasn't really a battle cruiser but a fast battleship, with all the armour of an unreconstructed Queen Elizabeth, having been massively redesigned on the stocks.

65 2018-04-29 22:32:12 There's a problem with the mechanics, but also a problem with people just blindly supporting anything different just because it's "not melee" or whatever.

If you want to make predictions about the future of oil, recognise that EVERYTHING is cyclical:
* investment 
* production growth 
* consumption growth 
* efficiency/conservation 
* costs
* prices
* stocks 
* inventories
* exploration
* refining margins

79 2018-04-29 22:03:22 Due to EU management, fish stocks are  really rather good.
80 2018-04-29 22:03:01 Yeah, that’s why the EU introduced fishing quota to ensure that fish stocks can regenerate. Kippers were foaming at the mouth because of that, but without it there would be no more cod in the British seas
81 2018-04-29 22:00:34 And the last time I checked, men were allowed in the same aisle of the supermarket that stocks female sanitary products in the same way women are allowed in the same section that sells condoms. What flaming century do you live in??
82 2018-04-29 21:59:13 Why don’t we sack everyone who doesn’t “believe” in Brexit and take their pensions from them. We could also put them in stocks and thrown rotten eggs at them. Let’s drain the swamp. Better still we could deport them.

138 2018-04-29 20:45:59 Probably not the most interesting takeaway, but I'm fascinated with managing a portfolio of 200 stocks, at a time when there was no computers.

141 2018-04-29 20:40:22 You’re lucky because most probably a manager of an equity fund holding oil company stocks has nominated you to receive 70% of the wealth after the owner of the fund died. All you need to do is to transfer USD 200 to the fund manager to make the transfer possible.

145 2018-04-29 20:36:14 Do so because a full prison means their stocks go up in value? Had a judge get over 20 years for sending first offense, nonviolent offenders away for years, always  kids of color..so healthy stock market? No problem with that but not from enterprises paid for with tax dollars
146 2018-04-29 20:35:58 The market is underestimating this substitution factor way too much right now.  Tons of people are over allocated to stocks versus bonds because of the lack of yield.  As this changes, so will how the equity market reacts to bad news.
147 2018-04-29 20:35:51 I’ll admit. I get different vibes from your posts.  It seems like lately I’m reading between the lines that maker is struggling than I read growth stocks appear fine

Too bad, so sad!
166 2018-04-29 20:07:15 I might have to invest in some stocks to speed up my goals.

172 2018-04-29 19:52:32 That’s just one example, tech and most other sector stocks are mostly down since the presidency changed hands. They’re just regurgitating lies and half truths taught to them by Fox, Alex Jones, and the like. Most of this can be debunked from government websites
173 2018-04-29 19:51:04 Considering the gains, if you were holding LTC for one year, you're way better off than holding traditional stocks. Even from the $110 low point to $160 in weeks is considerable.
174 2018-04-29 19:49:59 A friend asked me what I thought was a stupid question but on thinking about it there’s maybe more to his question than I first thought. So... why do you buy stocks?

217 2018-04-29 18:50:18 When I shot clays it was said with women it’s more like 50/50...interesting. Remember seeing guns with what can only be described as bendy stocks at arms fairs which were custom made for cross dominant shooters.

233 2018-04-29 18:35:04 Pot stocks have gone down in n Canada, but only due to overstocking. Once cannabis is legalized and the government is able to sell all the extra weed, the stocks should be jumping back up.

Dead fish may have been but so were many small fish.

Fish stocks have recovered because of this through EU regulations to the point where cod are now considered sustainable.

I never really understood with such clarity the term “blind hatred,” but the more I read of your work and your kindred hate-filled buddies, I get it. You are all becoming laughing stocks and making anything you might say, irrelevant and suspect. Give it a rest.
241 2018-04-29 18:25:13 The solution was the stock market but everyone let their financial advisors vote the stocks.

253 2018-04-29 18:13:37 Maybe they are going to place the "players" in stocks & provide house bricks instead of rotten fruit. I'd be up for that.

260 2018-04-29 18:05:25 Which methods I prefer to invest stocks?

Blend strategy(Value+growth),Momentum investing in bull market.
Price Breakout from consolidation,Narrow range breakout etc also good.

But,Cyclical investing is my favourite in sideways market due to better probability
261 2018-04-29 18:03:47 Let's break this down:

World #stocks, #bonds, #cash, #gold combined = $200 trillion. If a conservative 1% of that ends up in $crypto...

265 2018-04-29 18:00:25 When Trump bombed Syria, stocks of defence contracting companies like Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon etc went up. When Kim and Moon shook hands the Korean Summit, those same stocks dropped significantly. Explain 20 points.

What would be called “inside information” if committed in a corp.

285 2018-04-29 17:40:59 Technology changes.  In that sense markets change. But if we're talking stocks or crypto or whatever trading scenario we're looking at the way that people react to situations won't change anytime soon. We have generations of data to back this up.

291 2018-04-29 17:33:35 Stocks in Philly!
292 2018-04-29 17:33:32 I bought some Disney stocks a couple months ago when i heard about infinity war, so basically i just hit the jackpot.
293 2018-04-29 17:32:12 Same. You certain stocks were available?
294 2018-04-29 17:30:22 There isn't a question about it . There are alot of good stocks out there . Can't kiss all the girls . Just have to invest what u feel confident in. I have my main 4 but am in others. I am trying to play big in the ones which I think has the less risk .
295 2018-04-29 17:30:11 The most interesting thing about this is how divorced stock returns are from economic growth.  The economy grew faster in the '60s and '70s than in the '80s or '90s -- but stocks did better in the '80s and '90s because of interest rates & starting valuations.

299 2018-04-29 17:27:46 1/ Do you agree that if the balance shifts and stocks are sold en masse to buy bonds that interest rates will decline...?
300 2018-04-29 17:26:47 Um you need to have an account with a brokerage firm through which you can purchase stocks. Just like how it is here in Tadawul!
301 2018-04-29 17:24:30 Market Cap is misleading, not revealing the true market value of any virtual investments like stocks/cryptos. No wonder there are missing $ from wall street and why these investments can be easily manipulated. We need to calculate the true market value of all investments.
302 2018-04-29 17:23:55 This is a fine way to invest, but I think a lot of people are under invested in traditional assets such as stocks, and encouraging them use all of this money for coins is a disservice.
303 2018-04-29 17:22:47 1/ Interest rates are rising for a variety reasons, of which QT may or may not be one (on balance it probably is not, and normalization of inflation expectations is more influential).
2/ Very valid point regarding the relative (un-)attractiveness of stocks versus cash proxies
304 2018-04-29 17:18:44 The real reason you aren’t on $sx from the looks of the charts on your timeline is you only play stocks that are riding the wave to ZERO. Everything I see on your timeline is a play that was at its high and just going down... You don’t even know what the colour green looks like!

318 2018-04-29 17:05:47 Sir even indian railways charges 50% cancellation if you cancel within 4 hrs of departure. And you want airlines to charge only 25%. Strange. If you think airlines are looting people, best way to avoid that is buying airline stocks. You'll be millionaire by logic

365 2018-04-29 16:21:22 Ok but “your right” shouldn’t be to own any type of fully automatic rifle. Even ones that can be modified to be fully automatic shouldn’t be available. Bump stocks were a right? Come on.
366 2018-04-29 16:20:01 You probably saw my other tweet. Gold is insurance. Necessary to accumulate. Stocks are an investment. Keynesians love the stock market. You win by playing their game. Until they destroy the economy. Then your gold insurance kicks in.

Sure trade will continue but U.K. consumers will pay the tariffs on top of food already more expensive due to devalued pound 
397 2018-04-29 15:52:04 I also care because if it’s an app I rely on, I want to know that it’s being taken care of. Like, what happens if my preferred weather/stocks/whatever app breaks? Am I going to have to find a new one? Or is this an app under active development that would get fixed quickly?

399 2018-04-29 15:50:37 Problem is can the PI’s trust the house brokers who may also pump their stocks. I relied on sites like Stockopedia & iii, sat tight and prayed ! #IQE
400 2018-04-29 15:50:21 Stocks don't always have a dividend. And I have lost more in stocks then bitcoin. So you can call it investing or gambling, but they are BOTH in the same category. Maybe a CD or bond is guarnateed investing.
401 2018-04-29 15:50:13 We have a soda vending machine in our break room and I swear the dude who stocks it must hate us. It's all out of order and it's a gamble trying to get the drink you want.

I've been slowly getting better at soda roulette, since I knew to press the one for water to get Mt Dew.

405 2018-04-29 15:46:33 So you feel you need to further study this matter? Is this the same as when you said we need to further study bump stocks? #VoteThemOut2018

409 2018-04-29 15:44:30 Real estate can keep you busy with maintenance, disputes with neighbors, finding tenants, etc. Stocks tucked away and collect dividends so you’re able to focus attention elsewhere time with family, your business, or traveling. #RealEstateVsStocks #RealEstate #Stocks #Investment
410 2018-04-29 15:44:21 Hmmmmm my stocks are up and a very large %%% of our employees receive more $$$ in their weekly paycheck. You must be investing in @CNN or @MSNBC
411 2018-04-29 15:43:33 Yes, that is my takeaway also. Higher yields contribute to crash in stocks which causes flight to safety and bond yields dump. So up first then down. But I'm focused on the 10Y.
412 2018-04-29 15:42:59 hes so cute..... hes so cfucken cute he stocks all the cuteness and his muscles
413 2018-04-29 15:40:20 Not if lower yields are driven by a rush to safety as equities crash. I see 10Y bond yields rising again to higher highs and that contributes to the crash in stocks. Yields higher then lower. Commercials are telling you a peak in yields is coming, not when.

419 2018-04-29 15:35:52 Things like Real Estate & Stocks seem incapable to comprehend, but it's really just language. It's simple, just different terminology. I wish we learned these things as a people coming up.

423 2018-04-29 15:31:33 Lol same way you need a fool to buy your stocks at peak 
424 2018-04-29 15:31:26 Yes... They are... and if you're using "Market price" to compare two different tokens/stocks... you clearly shouldn't ever be reporting on tokens/stocks.  
Neither price nor cap have anything to do with popularity, utilization, or usefulness.
425 2018-04-29 15:27:56 Yes, let’s revist this in a month because I’m really curious on how this turns out.  We can agree to disagree on a certain ticker.  I have always appreciated your technical analysis when it comes to stocks.  I’ve just done my DD on this company and it’s not a typical OTC company.

429 2018-04-29 15:22:22 In stocks would just hold all At&t or would you have apple Google and some Amazon. Well that's how I look at it. BTC LTC ETH are majors with real use. EOS is snap chat to me right now. I hold a lil Eos my self. I use Abra/LTC for other good Exposure to other coins. MIX it up.
430 2018-04-29 15:22:18 Everything Katz said. I use volume profile the same way i use vwap. To find  holders. Also stocks move easier and with less “resistance” (up or down) through previous low vol areas, and tend to slow down/chop/consolidate when they reach prev high volume areas.

504 2018-04-29 14:06:25 Agree!!!! Been saying this for a couple years now. Treasuries are NOT safe long term due to US structural deficit impalance. Stocks are volatile, but safer long term (if diversified) bc business can adjust pricing levels to monetary shocks.

518 2018-04-29 13:57:00 Stocks sell offs can be justified or unjustified. Emotions can cause investors to run for the exits if they think economic conditions will weaken. My firm does not guess & takes the emotional part out of investing by measuring, testing & ranking sustainable sales & EPS est trends

530 2018-04-29 13:48:43 That's close to the issue we aim to help stakeholders imagine with the @FlourishingBiz toolkit. Sweeping in the "real ecosystem" stocks & services requires lots of tradeoffs in business models, that have to be mental modeled first.
531 2018-04-29 13:47:42 Not in my school it doesn't.. the entire time we learned about supply, demand&how the graph shifts.Thats it, we barely talked about money management. Only the different types of stalks. Not even establishing how to put money into stocks. The American education system is fucked up

¿Qué es Blue Chip Stocks?

Estas son las grandes compañías líderes en la industria. Ofrecen un registro estable de pagos de dividendos significativos y tienen una reputación de buena administración fiscal.
533 2018-04-29 13:46:52 I'm excited about BICB a company run by a U.S. Marine and HMPQ a company that is now producing medicine without the high with CBD oil. These two stocks just may improve my homeless from disaster situation. I'm publicly praying to GOD to please help through you
534 2018-04-29 13:46:25 Then why are stocks selling off on good earnings?
535 2018-04-29 13:44:45 I hope the prices just continue on dropping, and that I find them when I go to Tokyo again. I can only buy Kuroo merch if my friend’s hobby store has stocks of Kuroo
536 2018-04-29 13:43:46 Drove up cost of health care 10-50%. FACT: day after Obamacare passed, health care stocks went up 5% because these companies were set to make BILLIONS on high price plans with massive deductible that young healthy people would be forced to buy. Obama huge friend of Wall Street
537 2018-04-29 13:43:39 So the main thing I'm doing today is scanning for news on several stocks I have on my watchlist. Making sure I write down dates for PRs, conference Calls, and Earnings Report and then sorting through making different watchlists for each. #LetsDoIt #Simpltrader
538 2018-04-29 13:42:21 I been studying stocks for the last few years and I’m almost ready to invest. #ImAlmostReady #WatchMeWork
539 2018-04-29 13:42:05 Up like the stocks
540 2018-04-29 13:41:49 The biggest change I've made since trading live is trying to think like AJ during my scans. Most days, I just pat myself on the back for narrowing down my watchlist to 2 stocks that end up in AJ's notes. That was confirmation for me that I was beginning to see the bigger picture.
541 2018-04-29 13:41:14 How would u play the stocks if current govt doesn't get a clear majority in 2019?
542 2018-04-29 13:40:38 @valvesound80 Hi Valve, in a recent comment regarding em1, you mention better to leave stocks alone that some people are involved with, can you clarify who ? ... fine if you can't very interested though

548 2018-04-29 13:36:50 They were great if you enjoy a move to socialism...with Trump in the WH it is no surprise your stocks are doing well. Looks like we finally have a leader that will bring peace to Korea...another mess Obama left to clean up.
549 2018-04-29 13:35:03 I’m pretty sure the author acknowledges that a bear market is eventually coming and could sel stocks down by 40% or more.

567 2018-04-29 13:05:50 But rate rise means stocks probably go down and when stocks go down, gold goes up. Or am I missing something?

573 2018-04-29 13:00:09 The best way to earn wealth is to identify awesome stocks when they are shunned by all either due to temporary headwinds or when current financials hide the awesome value of an IPR, or when the industry is yet to be in limelight. Takes a lot of effort vision and balls of steel.

581 2018-04-29 12:52:40 @WarrenBuffett understood the economics of #Stocks back than to be great. But has failed to understand dynamics #bitcoin #crypto which will be used by world as most works will be done with the help of #AI.
582 2018-04-29 12:50:03 Yeah definitely the holy grail. If cryptos really are becoming a new asset class, leaving something in is definitely a good idea... We are trading Irish stocks here Mrs T, because they’ll just keep on Dublin  
583 2018-04-29 12:49:46 I'm really nasty when I tweet about tech stocks
584 2018-04-29 12:49:17 ah yes, a fish so slow growing that the stocks have been depleted.
they can live for over 150years..
585 2018-04-29 12:48:32 If the dollar rises, things priced in dollars fall... stocks?
586 2018-04-29 12:48:28 I went digging through Idex to find some gems and came up with a couple. 1) $AUC. retirement platform for crypto, stocks and bonds. Supply around $1 15 mil supply. 2) $ORI marketplace building platform backed by french banks, $.84 with supply of 4.2 mil!!!$AUC $BTC $ETH
587 2018-04-29 12:47:31 So why do you want to be in stocks? You don’t, if it’s for the short term. Waste of time and money. But, if for LT it can greatly increase wealth. Since 1990, $60/week in S&P 500 is now $400,000, Top 1/3rd wealth..
588 2018-04-29 12:46:43 The practice of flipping homes has removed too many homes, condos, & multi-families from the first time home buyer market. The places we live when traded like stocks vastly decrease the affordable # of places to live for individuals/families & increase home prices for everyone.
589 2018-04-29 12:44:25 How has the economy improved? Stocks volatile, interest rates rising, inflation too. In fact, economic growth SLOWED in the 1st quarter 2018.

611 2018-04-29 12:15:36 Yeah, very close - I use 20/48 EMA with 80 SMA.  Tbh, the actual #s don’t really matter that much, but I seemed to get slightly cleaner/more consistent pictures using these when I did testing.  And I use the 6H a lot so 80 sma translates to 20D on cryptos / 40D on stocks.

647 2018-04-29 11:18:47 Salary hike can’t make you wealth bcz inflation eats out more than your increased salary.  Therefore investments is better option to create wealth. Don’t invest only in stocks but also in real estate and government bonds because inflation impacts stocks market more than other 2.
648 2018-04-29 11:16:35 I need to clarify a bit... I  meant that the idea of 'Diworsified' portfolio was picked from Lynch book. Lynch had not dictated these stock numbers. To your specific question.. Lynch can have those many stocks because of the size of his portfolio, which ran to billions.
649 2018-04-29 11:16:12 Mine too. However, as not discretionary, I make bigger picture chart conclusions ie less interested in short term gyrations. Little suggests bear mkt in global stocks. Balance of probs is bull continues indeed strengthening.
650 2018-04-29 11:15:55 Mate. That's well done! Really good analysis. And record keeping. Would love to get your advice on some of my record keeping. As I'm starting to do more, but hard when I'm trading between 10-20 stocks a day all diff position size all diff reasons. Hard to keep track of.

656 2018-04-29 11:02:37 Regardless of whether 2011 was a -20% sell off or not, it was not a bear market in my opinion. It was a very sharp and swift correction which lasted about 2 weeks. In some ways like 1987 but not as strong.

It was a bear marker for European and EM stocks though.

664 2018-04-29 10:55:53 Big Mistake Newbie Crypto Investors Make... 
They think the price of the coin, means the potential gains are higher. 

Buying $EOS or $XRP because they trade under $1, do not mean they will ever reach $9000 like $BTC 

It's like new Stock Market investors buying penny stocks.

There are no thumb rules for investing. It's a really tough game. 

Anyone selling u - "cheap stocks", "low pe stocks", "richly priced stocks", "emerging sector", etc. are just good sellers. 

Best to stay away from story tellers & do ur own research.

687 2018-04-29 10:14:53 Sir, unstall/reinstall
688 2018-04-29 10:14:34 Having said that, while global stocks as a whole had a bear market in 2011/12 and 2015/16... US stocks (in my opinion) haven’t had a bear market since 2008.

After all they are up 9 years in the row, and on a monthly closing basis we haven’t seen a 20% drawdown since the GFC.
689 2018-04-29 10:12:27 My money is where my mouth is... gov bonds to bust, stocks and other tangible assets to rise. This is private investment cycle we’re in... not a public investment cycle. Bond Yields are rising (have doubled since late 2016), and will double again? And then again? Massive loses.
690 2018-04-29 10:10:28 @SiddharthaTopse Sir, please suggest 4-5 stocks to invest for decent return over next 9-12 months. Thank you.
691 2018-04-29 10:08:53 The Bond market will drive interest rate levels... the free market will decide the price of debt. Stocks are a tangible safe haven, the DOW being the ultimate stock market in the world. As bonds bust, I see capital moving into stocks. Perhaps the inverse of what you’re thinking?
692 2018-04-29 10:01:45 Funny you should say that, stocks was indeed a punishment given to fraudulent bankers in days past.  This sort of thing may well happen again, if the public mood becomes fiery

794 2018-04-29 06:45:49 A lot of the political message is in Namjoon’s verse with the wordplay, especially this part:

“Given up on 3? Given up on 5??
I like the number 6, how about giving up on 6?
The media and adults say we don’t have willpower, condemning us like stocks”
795 2018-04-29 06:45:36 No it’s not fuck wit Carlton wogs footy club are bigger laughing stocks than ess
796 2018-04-29 06:43:40 Given the structure of MF and likely participants, I believe MFs must avoid "obvious bad stocks"

800 2018-04-29 06:38:13 Stock investing is not a game?  Many stocks offer no decision authority in what the company does, nor share any profit.  How is that better than bitcoin?  At least bitcoin has no central control of a bank or government.
801 2018-04-29 06:38:12 How can anyone think Trump is doing a good job with the economy?   He is bankrupting the government. Stocks are falling. Prices are rising. Job growth has slowed. 

Only the super wealthy are doing better.
802 2018-04-29 06:35:40 Long af lmaooo ok ok I get it tho. I just think Warren is a conservative and sticks to perfecting his area of expertise. He's even said it. The future isn't just stocks bro lol
803 2018-04-29 06:35:36 You said I hate Muslims,blatant lie. My math?You claim 400 die weekly, every week,for how many weeks now?Stocks must be running thin 
Quote sources?Like biased articles & 'gospel' statistics?Lmfao.Your ideas are 100% flawed. You know this but just close your eyes when it suits.

814 2018-04-29 06:25:17 Was corporate governance always a question? I think there have always been corp governance questions on many stocks - from Reliance, to Indiabulls to Future group to Raymond. They all generated returns. And they haven't (yet) gone under. So that's okay?
815 2018-04-29 06:24:20 Investment idea: What until there is a dip in the market, then find a few stocks that have held up well and have reasonably solid fundamentals. Chances are many of them are going to come out blasting, while the remaining ones are caught by your stop loss orders
816 2018-04-29 06:22:19 Sir any new stocks for results,  like bhel and idea
817 2018-04-29 06:22:12 Chipkao to corrupt instituitional investors who would deploy 1% in such shit and not care abt it - old style uti lic fitting of kachra stocks which ultimately land at the bottom of the balance sheet under miscellaneous category

820 2018-04-29 06:18:57 They must be pulling their hair out in Silicon Valley. These fears may explain, at least partially, the rotation out of chip stocks lately. Disheartening...
821 2018-04-29 06:18:19 Congratulations for this achievement, only you can think of this as you know our problem. How about sr citizens above 75yrs health security, interest from Bank reduced children don't care, living has become defficult, in Karnataka we can not buy farm land. Stocks investment risky
822 2018-04-29 06:17:42 Manipulated balance sheets just like satyam did,

825 2018-04-29 06:15:53 But buying Maruti, HDFC Bank, HDFC , L & T and many such other blue chip stocks is also neither skill nor luck. It is just acting on basic information. Why do I need fund manager for that??
826 2018-04-29 06:12:10 Sell commodities/gold stocks? No thanks.
827 2018-04-29 06:11:58 There’s a mentally handicapped girl who stocks inventory at my work and she’s been really down because her case manager has been mean to her. Today our boss surprised her that she’s “employee of the month” and everyone got cupcakes :’)

829 2018-04-29 06:10:10 I did. You said 2018 is the FIRST year people had to read up on their investments. I said one should always research before investing.

You talking about yourself here? Cuz real investors do their homework. N00bs play penny stocks with remortgaged homes.
830 2018-04-29 06:09:10 Sir, its fundamental doesn't look that strong, if you compare its last 5yr performance, and its pe is 70, wht makes you think its cheap?
831 2018-04-29 06:08:52 Did you think of a way to bankrupt them? Like you tried to do to the Canadians invested in stock market (weed stocks) remember? You tried to bankrupt us? Couple weeks ago? Why won’t you respond? Canadians paid huge to bring everybody back to Ottawa!!! You don’t care about us
832 2018-04-29 06:06:28 Comedy winners in Aces buy call competition. Just like when MYSQ was picked earlier in year! The irony that the stocks ticker is P!ss Self Laughing is just brilliant! 
833 2018-04-29 06:06:28 What's your favorite JC Premiere product? DJ Chacha is loving her omni white soap to keep her radiant.

Stocks on hand.
834 2018-04-29 06:03:04 I think what we should ask is what exactly it takes to make you believe that you have a good chance at that awesome race you want to see. Personally I’ll watch street stocks all day if it involves a photo finish.
835 2018-04-29 06:02:46 Lmao I feel that, but hey it isn’t my life, I’m just trying to get the baby some fat stacks when it’s older. Imagine 10 mil worth of stocks and bonds 18 years later. That’s some mean growth

838 2018-04-29 05:57:33 I agree, he says bitcoin traders are not traders because who will pay more than the last.  Dip shit...  that’s how all stocks work.

841 2018-04-29 05:45:04 in terms of agricultural subsidies, rural employment schemes and finances locked into huge agricultural stocks, for getting at least comparable agricultural output growth. In any case, it is not too late even now.
842 2018-04-29 05:42:54 Thx. One more thing, is PE avl for individual nse stocks in chart format.

859 2018-04-29 05:03:11 This is a good moves @plus2u to add more SSK, as the terminal and reload services at petrol stations and other provider always out of stocks or offline. Quite troublesome sometimes at least this could make our travelling more convenient
860 2018-04-29 05:02:43 Everyone is a globalist puppet the amt of $$ being made from us talking about it on a major social media platform is making those at top $$$& so I wouldn’t be surprised if even a hedge funder based on stocks since SoCial media paid

867 2018-04-29 04:55:16 At the beginning of 2000, the 10 largest market-cap tech stocks in the United States, collectively representing a 25% share of the S&P 500 Index—Microsoft, Cisco, Intel, IBM, AOL, Oracle, Dell, Sun, Qualcomm, and HP—did not live up to the excessively optimistic expectations.
868 2018-04-29 04:53:16 So Trump degrades the office of the president in between personal attacks on whoever he targets that day NOT to mention tanking stocks AND he’s supposed to be off limits? Not in this lifetime.

874 2018-04-29 04:40:39 Expect a couple of brokers nobody seems to have survived or made a substantial fortune by investing in stocks among the madras brokers. The children of these have nothing to do with equity markets. Wonder why?

877 2018-04-29 04:37:24 One of my earliest memories is going to second line beach road to the offices of a broker and buying some stocks I must have been 18.

The response from our members were very overwhelming and thus the stocks has run out quicker than we thought. Could you please DM me?
879 2018-04-29 04:35:20 Because the only people the company is beholden to are the shareholders, no one else.  As long as the shareholders are happy and the stocks are making money, everyone is happy.  Everything else is secondary in their eyes.

889 2018-04-29 04:21:04 Of course. He 2 stocks every other bayo because they are scrubs. Always remember that.

892 2018-04-29 04:13:46 Sa fiesta mo na lang mararanasan kumain ng sunod sunod at dito mo lang mararanasan na di ka mapapagalitan kasi naubos na yung stocks niyo
893 2018-04-29 04:10:04 Yes, I have. If you are going to take 5-10 years to build up your down payment, odds get better. But if you started investing in 2003 with an intent to use your stocks to buy in 2008, well sucks to suck. Depends on your risk tolerance
894 2018-04-29 04:08:45 Oh no, not the defense stocks. Won't somebody please think of the arms dealers before they go negotiating historic peace treaties?

916 2018-04-29 03:31:48 I could see value working again but guessing it will have to get killed first. Valuation spread vs growth blowing out. The entire value category must become hated, just like its stocks. Still too crowded. The last time value was great was after it was ran over by the tech bubble.

921 2018-04-29 03:25:21 Statistical value has been arbitraged away in liquid stocks imo. It happened to low P/B a long time ago so only natural the other metrics followed. Writing was on the wall when factor investors with hundreds of billions arrived.
922 2018-04-29 03:22:44 Hell yeah. Playing the long game with the stocks/ crypts

924 2018-04-29 03:17:12 Two questions. 1)Are they going to be placed in stocks? 2)Will rotten fruit be available for throwing?
925 2018-04-29 03:14:36 No sir/ma'am I have not received anything yet I apologize. I would not be opposed to another resend of trade best stocks information. If that is okay with you guys?
926 2018-04-29 03:10:53 I was laughing last night when Anil said he likes wire! I thought he will discover the reality soon. These are like bad stocks. You may get attracted for some reason but you will run for your life soon. LOL!

929 2018-04-29 03:06:21 1/2 What would you prefer them to buy? Bitcoin that is beyond the comprehension of the world’s most successful investor?  You are intentionally misunderstanding him.

936 2018-04-29 02:59:24 Onloading and offloading both simultaneously is new tactical weapon of stocks , hv to be very careful
937 2018-04-29 02:59:11 The MACD in the third party data I use for stocks above MAs uses $BTK and is price adjusted. Big cycles are usually 6 and 10% drops eyeballing last 4-5 years. 12% did happen 2015/16. The drop from Jan into March was 6% with a bounce then on to 10%. Means nothing. Suggestive tho.

943 2018-04-29 02:45:34 important for all retail investors to study their pf stocks/ new purchases continuously, do not buy basis recommendations from brokerage houses/advice from people/channels like @sptulsian @CNBCTV18News.Moti,ISec,Kotak recommended PCJ. @_anujsinghal said pcj is a screaming buy.

954 2018-04-29 02:27:40 Check out Toys R US!! Upper Management is walking away with millions, the employees are losing their jobs and no money for them. Other corporations are buying back their own stocks and laying off workers!! So go ahead and continue to LIE to the American People.
955 2018-04-29 02:24:23 Weird tech cross currents. Since Apr 2 low, all groups up ~5% with bios at 6%! networking at 4%. Semis are down 2ish% though.

957 2018-04-29 02:21:51 Yes he is.. Like srsly. If you give money to companies that cause death and suffering you are rewarding that behavior.. And yes if you invest in war stocks you suck.
958 2018-04-29 02:20:43 good stocks ba
959 2018-04-29 02:18:14 I’m no expert either just my opinion and what I have observed with other stocks last while, seem to be highly manipulated
960 2018-04-29 02:17:01 Won’t this mean the presence of mostly “intelligent” investors in high-priced stocks? At first glance, seemed to me that this is detrimental to getting bargains. The best bargains are when fools are found in plenty!
961 2018-04-29 02:15:31 1/ This is so ignorant that it doesn't warrant a response but I'll give you a free lesson. Go look at the cover of @barronsonline in Dec '99 that read ''What's wrong Warren?" and chastised him for having 'lost his touch' and not investing in tech stocks in the tech bubble.
962 2018-04-29 02:13:19 yes, and I’m confident about it, but there always high risk with penny stocks, manage ur risk & how much u afford to lose.,, IMO

963 2018-04-29 02:12:45 Because they’re not trading stocks with the right trading mentor. Because they hurry to make riches and forget money does grow, just not on trees , in Trading the stocks ! Not investing in them.
964 2018-04-29 02:12:18 @NRA hypocrisy! They won’t agree to banning bump stocks and high capacity magazines to protect children, but willing to do gun grabs to protect @VP.
965 2018-04-29 02:11:45 I love late model stocks. That is all.

Hows trading SSR stocks different? I traded TNDM on fri & kept seeing hiden sellers but then it rallied hard
974 2018-04-29 02:01:29 Yes it does. You just have to stay consistent. I started investing in stocks junior year of college. Now I’m learning to invest smarter instead of just picking companies at random. That forex stuff is on another level.
975 2018-04-29 02:01:26 I feel you there, I love my MAS-36 but the 7.5 French ammo it takes is expensive. You can find old Syrian stocks of it, as I did, but the ammo is quite unreliable. At least half of the rounds I got failed.

990 2018-04-29 01:33:41 Ayy @kamkam2299 I’m getting some reviews from the Stocks from professional dancers and we need to work on our “technique and showmanship”
991 2018-04-29 01:31:37 seems like a waste of time. you could be researching stocks with that kinda time
992 2018-04-29 01:30:54 Ap's tip of the day. Always place a straddle call with plus-minus 5 percent for tech stocks near ER. It worked without exception for MU, LRCX and AMD.
993 2018-04-29 01:29:10 In 15 years EPS has gone up close to 8.5 times, while market cap has gone up more than 50 times. Does that have to do anything with these kind of stocks? Also how come market cap growth is not in proportion to stock price from 1100 to 80000?
994 2018-04-29 01:29:01 And no, banning bump stocks doesn't count.
995 2018-04-29 01:27:33 Not a whiny little baby man quite a happy man. Under Obama my stocks never moved, I plan on retiring in 12 years and now I can under Obama I would have had to work till I'm 80!  Perhaps if you got off your liberal high-horse and started really reading into things you would get it
996 2018-04-29 01:26:53 Yes he's gotten a lot in the auto industry. You can't blame Trump for the deaths of people, blame the killers. Trump banned bump stocks, but I guess that doesn't count.

1003 2018-04-29 01:01:52 When people ask me how i trade stocks or crypto I always tell them that they should look at thir own progress as a trader than the coin itself. #cryptocurrency #crypto However #dApps should be our main focus and utilize the technology.
1004 2018-04-29 01:01:43 Just buy good cryptos stocks are way overvalued and scammy. Those companies don’t stand a chance. Adapt or die.

1021 2018-04-29 00:40:07 Something I learned from investing is that stocks will move up or down before the actual result or event occurs. You got to be knowledgeable about predicting a stock’s move before the news comes out or you missed the move.

1024 2018-04-29 00:38:28 It’s unfortunate because Megan Kelly is a bonafide star. She was the conservative darling at Fox News and her stocks were high. Then she asked Candidate Trump that very appropriate question about his treatment of women and suddenly she became the enemy.
1025 2018-04-29 00:36:55 Oh Lori. I don’t even know what to do with this message. That said, it’s not nearly as bad as your disdain for raspberries which I simply cannot wrap my head around. It’s almost crazy enough to make me understand why you don’t have a blue check.
1026 2018-04-29 00:35:36 I don't trade low float stocks, its all about community for me. Myself a full time trader, trading from home its good to be in a community. #warriortrading or which works for you. I actually follow several chats social groups. I like seeing other trades progress & successs.

1035 2018-04-29 00:28:43 For Smash Bros. on the Switch Nintendo should make a mode where you can select multiple characters as stocks so when you loose a stock you'll switch to a different character and they should call it "Switch Mode"
1036 2018-04-29 00:27:16 Meh. I've tried five times. If I can't get more consideration than the guy who begged Wendy's for free nuggs, I'm done.
1037 2018-04-29 00:26:47 Nope nope nope.

When the American Middle Class was thriving & a family could afford a house, car, vacations, etc. off one salary, taxes on the top 1% were much higher. And you know what? They were still super rich!

Their stocks did well because working people had money

1039 2018-04-29 00:23:52 The Bin Laden family has owned stocks in the defense company Lockheed Martin; stocks which have tripled since the dawn of the war on terror.
1040 2018-04-29 00:17:28 Fair enough, when put that way I think it should be inclusive to the former. For example, if a course offered was about investment or the growth of savings we should see those finances invested into businesses or stocks which are benificial to the greater good
1041 2018-04-29 00:17:09 All I know is I’m gonna keep talking to you all and maybe I can someday write about sports too!  I mean, I do have an English degree. I write good. :)
1042 2018-04-29 00:15:22 News always has been the biggest mover of stocks. A stock moving up because of legit news isn’t a “pump”
1043 2018-04-29 00:14:44 The whole financial markets are gambling, bitcoin is not behaving differently than stocks, FX, or commodities
1044 2018-04-29 00:12:52 I also invested in stocks, land, and some other things that pays the bills to do what I want in life! I also don't have kids, or a wife Im enjoying life
1045 2018-04-29 00:11:44 Haha, he’s very persistent. Actually since our site is verified, we were able to have a handful of employees verified too.

1047 2018-04-29 00:10:00 Corporations are made of everyday people that buy stocks to support themselves and don’t you ever forget that asshole!
1048 2018-04-29 00:09:12 Small caps outperform over full market cycle. Over a 15 year period, as illustrated above, a
$10,000 investment in small cap company stocks would have grown to $124,669 compared to
$90,064 for large company stocks#raisingrates
1049 2018-04-29 00:05:18 Currently at 8 sprint cars, 10 Street stocks, 28 Northwest Focus midgets, 13 modifieds. Some sprint cars from Skagit are on their way down. So that count could change.
1050 2018-04-29 00:04:28 Maybe but I thought that was over. And you definitely should’ve gotten yours before the Nazis Lori.
1051 2018-04-29 00:04:18 TOTD for the ladies out there: if u dont wanna be stuck with premature osteomalacia, try wearing less foundation in the summer (its the occasion for ur skin to regenerate its vitamin D3 stocks, which will last you the entire winter). You can go back to wearing it after!!
1052 2018-04-29 00:04:17 seems like a good reason to suspend it.
1053 2018-04-29 00:04:06 Mm, I do like bonds. And stocks!
1054 2018-04-29 00:00:29 I believe they've actually suspended the verification process after some controversy over the fact that they gave Nazis blue check marks.
1055 2018-04-28 23:58:58 How did he get it for you?!?!  He’s a “Zero time Tony Award winner”. ;)
1056 2018-04-28 23:57:31 Well Tams having one should really get you moving. Evidently, they are VERY easy to get. Maybe just write a story about a musical you saw and they’ll give you one.

1059 2018-04-28 23:56:53 It also banned bump stocks and strengthened background checks...both of which I support.
1060 2018-04-28 23:55:20 trying to slide into my DM’s will get ya blocked, I’ll de-Feet you online and make your bots kick rocks. Stocks worth as much as a wet dutch master, ya low class tactics, over charging for bags, masking rules with an asterisk.
1061 2018-04-28 23:55:19 I have never smoked and don't have much respect for potheads...if I become a millionaire from weed stocks would that make me a hypocrite or be the best example of irony there ever was 
1062 2018-04-28 23:55:02 I’ve been angry at twitter lately for not given the ladies their blue check marks. Seems fishy to me.
1063 2018-04-28 23:55:01 I just haven’t wanted to go through the annoying steps to get one...I will eventually

1065 2018-04-28 23:53:54 Mom came up with new products and R&D done, so now is looking at marketing. We have so much stocks to prepare and insya Allah sale will look good.
1066 2018-04-28 23:52:33 Buying stocks is specifically part of the BOJ mandate, unlike the FED, the ECB, the BOE or the BOC
1067 2018-04-28 23:52:16 I’m not getting into a blue check mark contest (Lori would never talk to me again), but I got that for the exact journalistic opposite of sports
1068 2018-04-28 23:51:45 Not quite.  Stocks are going to be highly affected by monetary policy and ease getting access to money.  They can be highly overvalued in times when money is easy to come by, especially before malinvestments are realized due to increasing production costs/salaries.
1069 2018-04-28 23:50:40 Got you good Matt!!!!
1070 2018-04-28 23:50:35 those bottoms....lol my stocks look better than these
1071 2018-04-28 23:49:49 Well Matt, I tend to agree; but, you do have a blue twitter check mark....unlike Audrey. ;)
1072 2018-04-28 23:49:43 Feels like Christmas when your mother-in-law stocks you up with your favorite chip that seems to ALWAYS be sold out! Thanks mom!! Lol...nom nom nom. I was so excited that I knocked over the container. It was like gold was spilling all over the place. Lol
1073 2018-04-28 23:48:06 At some point the left will have to recede back into their socialist she'll and just watch. They'll  never give President Trump the credit he deserves. It goes against their global socialist views. Kleenex stocks should be up though.
1074 2018-04-28 23:45:51 Not sure I qualify as a sports journalist, especially compared to Audrey...

1095 2018-04-28 23:44:32 We need to show the Left no mercy- understanding what makes them powerful & dismantling it. We should demand that pension funds don’t include stocks for Alt Left companies that go after the Bill of Rights. There should be movements to divest from the companies the Left controls.
1096 2018-04-28 23:42:35 Dat feel when your biggest investment is up 25% in a single day.

I'll never be able to invest in stocks.
1097 2018-04-28 23:42:00 Are you thinking stocks buy back?
1098 2018-04-28 23:40:39 I buy 21% of stocks

1102 2018-04-28 23:35:58 Correcting chartdata said PURE: so in this case,only physical & digital sales are counted (not Track equivalent neither streaming equivalent sales)
Back to the topic: we need high sales & streams from

1106 2018-04-28 23:31:20 Lols you drank the kool-aid. Did you fact check numbers when idiot took over. They were low for job rate. Obama walked into a bad recession, got the Country out of it. Interest low, job rate 4.7, stocks high. Check your facts. In fact DT has had lower nos. At the same time period
1107 2018-04-28 23:30:01 Huge respect !!
1108 2018-04-28 23:25:13 Lost decade for stocks.
From 1972 to 1973, inflation doubled to more than 6 percent. By 1974 it was 11 percent. In those two years, the S&P 500 declined by a combined 40 percent. Inflation was higher in 1979 and 1980, topping out at 13.5 percent.

Hoffman-Shoop-Schoch after the first group.
1116 2018-04-28 23:12:08 Streaming from hell? Would be nice to get a sneak peek. You'll never know how much your stocks could rise.
1117 2018-04-28 23:06:26 Tank the stocks George Soros owns.
1118 2018-04-28 23:05:53 Hey shill you're too old for crypto go trade stocks or gold dude
1119 2018-04-28 23:03:12 US needs $5T in bond buying this yr; we likely can’t fund this internally w/out stocks falling, but as stocks fall, the amount we need to fund rises.
1120 2018-04-28 23:02:01 Never thought to associate pnd with anything but stocks or crypto.
Hmm.... 
This has opened my mind 
1121 2018-04-28 23:00:09 bud, the nasdaq took 6k days or 15 years to recover to its ATH from the .COM crash. likewise, internet stocks back then were also going to change the world. 90% died, 5% were very successful and many hadnt ben invented yet. just a bit of perspective, from us old enough to remeber
1122 2018-04-28 22:59:09 Record employment, strong economy, defeated ISIS, record stocks, denuclearized NK.  I hope he finds some more things to wreck.
1123 2018-04-28 22:58:33 And those job creators did what they told you they were going to do. They invested in their own stocks. #BlueWave2018
1124 2018-04-28 22:53:46 Been in stocks 25+ yrs and have learned few people actually know anything.  Trying to convince others that not only is crypto real, but that Cryptonary appears to really have insight is even harder.   Keep it going and they will believe, and I can prove them wrong!!
1125 2018-04-28 22:50:58 If you think so. When obama went iinto office we were loosing thousands of jobs a month. The stocks dropped I think from 14000 to 8000. When he left unemployment 5.4 percent stocks rise from 8000 to 18000 or more. People who never health care had it. Look up facts
1126 2018-04-28 22:50:53 They’ve been right so far... but you’re absolutely right; shame is not part of their dna. If I had my way, guys like Holder would be whipped through the streets of DC, then put in stocks in front of the Capital for public abuse.
1127 2018-04-28 22:47:40 There’s a sale at the BDSM shop. 

While stocks last.
1128 2018-04-28 22:46:59 After you've done some investing in actual stocks, based on the sales of actual products to actual customers, it's difficult to see crypto as anything other than speculative mania.  I recommend Robinhood for anyone looking to ACTUALLY diversify their investments.
1129 2018-04-28 22:46:12 He looks like he's in the stocks.
1130 2018-04-28 22:39:54 Pro Stocks are beginning to gear up for hot laps.  The track could be lightning fast tonight.
1131 2018-04-28 22:38:38 With respect to the textbook chapter I’m writing, secured transactions law applies to: auto financing purchases, pawn shops, and stocks bought on margin. Failure to repay = lender gets the collateral. #Banking #finance
1132 2018-04-28 22:37:25 There will be hedge funds which trade purely on crypto versions of stocks
1133 2018-04-28 22:32:24 Pro stocks are heading to the track for the first session of hot laps tonight.  Brad Mitch is the first car down the front stretch.  Mitch won this race last year.
1134 2018-04-28 22:26:29 Lol it was not you. What we Judge on is Draft value/potential talent. Kinda like judging a new business in the stock market on whether or not it's a good investment. Just like stocks though only time will truly tell.
1135 2018-04-28 22:26:11 Should i make an StreamOverlay-Pack for you guys ?  

With some Stocks // Textures // PNG´s // Tutorial how to animate Stuff...

I think it would be a crazy pack
1136 2018-04-28 22:21:51 I'm guessing you don't own any stocks then.
1137 2018-04-28 22:20:59 @CharlesSchwab same old crooked wall street scam suckering people to buy at the top like in 1987, 2000 and 2008.without stocks buybacks the dow would be 14000 not 24000. Amazon just made 4 dollars eps that 16. 1600 divided by 16 is a pe of 100 with no dividend.
1138 2018-04-28 22:18:45 هم في ورطة مثل ما خبرتك

1144 2018-04-28 22:10:09 Your "friends" surely should rely messages that the economy was fine long before Trump took office. What everyone should take note of now is who gets tax cuts, home ownership and interest rates, majority all ALL Americans don't OWN stocks so Stock Market doesn't matter to them
1145 2018-04-28 22:09:11 Better get one ready.
1146 2018-04-28 22:08:10 Absolutely 
Don’t have those Obamacare regs any more

1148 2018-04-28 22:06:04 Christ, with people like you out in the world, I need to invest in some tinfoil stocks.
1149 2018-04-28 22:03:42 For crying out loud.  That is baloney. Insurance down? Gas down? Stocks and hiring  are on the same trajectory as they were,  at least until recently.   But the bank regs thing might be true, except it was like that before and look what happened.
1150 2018-04-28 22:01:21 .@WarrenBuffett  says #Bitcoin is #Gambling not #Investing. But #Stocks are at ridiculously (2nd in history) dangerous #Schiller P/Es. So which is really more of a gamble putting in $10,000 now?

1155 2018-04-28 21:52:29 I'm playing with this robinhood app for buying stocks, got $20 in HMNY (Moviepass) because the value is in the gutter. If they survive this fiasco I'm sure it'll go up again. If they dont, well, what's 20 dollars

1157 2018-04-28 21:51:54 Apparently you need a lesson in economics: equity in real property is not a profit.  Real estate is not a liquid asset until it is sold, just like stocks.

What you're talking about is net worth.  His net worth is reported to be down $1 billion since he took office. So try again

17 410s, 42 @ULMSRACING late models, 18 355 econo late models and 10 extreme stocks are signed in.
1168 2018-04-28 21:29:44 Grinding with you is the most fun I have playing, and falling behind in stocks taken as is typically how it goes is such a big source of motivation to rectify my mistakes. As shallow as it might sound, keeping up with, or exceeding you in medals gives me a sense of accomplishment

If a D, whether state/fed level, doesn't support these, it's doubtful he'll get D base support.

1210 2018-04-28 20:59:37 tbh, that’s based on economy. that’s a variable cost in the economic world. POTUS has nothing to do w/ the rising of gas prices. only reason why they’re high is bc of inflation, even stocks are at high prices rn 
1211 2018-04-28 20:57:03 Only thing that will help at this point is vast #Entrepreneurship & owning properties. We have to switch our focus from materialism & switch to group economics. So instead of buying unaffordable Yeezy's, buy some stocks.

1217 2018-04-28 20:43:29 Any tips on value investing in cryptos?

Stocks = company factors that affect its cashflow

Fiat currencies = macroeconomics affecting countries GDP's and trade

Crypto = i have no idea
1218 2018-04-28 20:41:07 Of course he would seeing how Berkshire Hathaway has a major invested interest in the tens of billions in bank stocks.  Bitcoin and crypto takes out the banks and his life’s work will suffer tremendous losses.

1222 2018-04-28 20:38:18 Yes because all poor  people invest in stocks big boy. And that’s what y’all fugazi arse will never learn.
1223 2018-04-28 20:36:59 While growth stocks often appear expensive based on traditional metrics like the P/E ratio, growth investors believe these companies will grow earnings so rapidly that they are actually much cheaper than they appear.
1224 2018-04-28 20:36:37 موافق ،، اشتغل عليهم ٦ شهور وورجيني كيف مش حيطيرو

1225 2018-04-28 20:36:36 8. Growth stock investors are not worried about the income their stocks generate, or even their current valuations. The most important factor for growth investors is that their stocks have a long runway of growth ahead. The greater the growth, the better.
1226 2018-04-28 20:36:15 While some income investors might be content to hold safer investments such as CDs & bonds (in an effort to preserve capital over creating wealth), active income investors turn to owning stocks that pay dividends. When you purchase a stock, you become a partial owner of a company

1231 2018-04-28 20:32:53 This can be accomplished either through acquiring individual stocks or a collection of mutual funds run by active managers.
1232 2018-04-28 20:32:26 Passive investors prefer a hands-off approach, preferring to regularly put money into index funds or ETFs (exchange-traded funds), both of which are designed to imitate the performance of an applicable benchmark by purchasing all of the stocks contained within that benchmark.
1233 2018-04-28 20:31:23 2. For day traders, holding a position could be a matter of mere seconds. Swing traders generally hold onto stocks for a period of a few days or weeks.
1234 2018-04-28 20:30:39 6. Why active investing might be right for you
7. Income investing: Get paid to own your stocks
8. Growth investing: Finding companies with room to run
9. Value investing: Buy low, sell high

1257 2018-04-28 19:58:59 It seems, if the #NRA is sanguine about "gun free venue requirements" then the goal of #MSD and the rest of us, is for Statewide and Countrywide venue requirements  banning assault weapons, bump stocks, oversize clips and requiring background checks.
1258 2018-04-28 19:56:56 From what I’ve read, when you don’t include “sin stocks” (alcohol, tobacco, firearms) the returns have been better. Expense ratio is slightly higher. Obviously varies based on which index you choose ...

1264 2018-04-28 19:50:08 It's custody, not ownership. Like stocks or an apartment in a building. Ownership implies full  property.
1265 2018-04-28 19:49:57 Lls oh you included the magic numbers nice and did you put in protecting crooked cops. Oh yeah yes let’s pollute. The same stocks who are back they  where before, the umemployment rate has come back up and he has done worse unemployment wise than Obama. Tax cuts that gonna cost
1266 2018-04-28 19:48:20 Stocks are more complicated - firms are taxed at corporate level, dividend tax is complicated, then there are deferred capital gains taxes (with deferral at a greater subsidy than even BC). Point is that financial savings are taxed progressively, too.
1267 2018-04-28 19:48:17 Are bhai 
Pehle stocks to thik kar
1268 2018-04-28 19:48:15 يعطيكم العافيه نتعلم منكم ... ومن خلال ملاحظتي افضل شي انه الواحد لما يدخل الفوركس .. يدخل بهل طريقة ... مثلا لو اودع فحسابه ٣٠٠ دولار .. مايدخل فاي عمليه فوق ١٠٠ دولار والباقي يخليها لمارجن الخساره عشان ماتسكر عليه الصفقه بسرعه .. ويتريه الارتداد لو كان السوق ماشي عكسه

1281 2018-04-28 19:27:22 Going with his way of thinking. Buying any stocks is not investing as well as its not earning you passive income.
Funny enough some of the cryptos do offer passive income in various ways

1303 2018-04-28 19:01:15 I reckon if you put Nigel Farage in stocks and toured him around the country with a £1 fee to throw a rotten vegetable at him, you'd make a fuck load of money that could go to good causes. The toad-faced twat has to have some use
1304 2018-04-28 19:00:42 I don’t actually do that because I’m a student and unemployed, yet what I think is gonna work is investing money in stocks/bonds, that way it can’t be liquidized easily and can survive momentarily temptations.
1305 2018-04-28 18:57:45 Wonder what they are resisting? I see Jobs, bonuses, lower taxes and my stocks doing better than they ever have.  Sadly wisdom comes with maturity so they have about 15 years before they wake up.
1306 2018-04-28 18:57:28 TRUMPISM- shaped by the 1%:
Dismantle FED govt, weaken REGULATIONS, Selective enforcement.
TAXSCAM-Accord to CBO-80% of econo benefits go to non-US nations. 50% of stocks owned by non-US citizens.
Kochroaches-pollute environment, plunder the commons.
1307 2018-04-28 18:57:25 Just invested into some stocks
1308 2018-04-28 18:57:05 Gold, Silver, Crypto, Stocks, Property, all better than holding all your savings in USD.

1313 2018-04-28 18:45:54 صعبة ال ١٠٠ حبة والله اعلم.. اتطلع على المؤشرات الاخرى والكوريلشين مع الدولار .. يعني اغلب الترجيح ان نرجع نشوف هبوط للدولار عالمدى الاطول
1314 2018-04-28 18:44:28 I don’t need any person to manage my stocks and I don’t give any stupid recommendations and get paid for it.

1318 2018-04-28 18:40:59 نعم لاته بدل ما يدخل بمبلغ جيد وبتداول نفس ما يتداول في الاسهم كمبدأ ومخاطر وخلافه. بتلاقيه بفوت ب ٥٠٠ دولار او ٢٠٠٠ وبجرب بنحرقوا وبرجع بجرب وبرجع بجرب و٥٠٠ ورا ٥٠٠  وهكذا

1342 2018-04-28 18:19:07 Bump stocks do not make a semi auto into a fully auto. Also the bump stock is incredibly inaccurate.

1368 2018-04-28 17:46:17 Is the ban on bump stocks a violation of #2A?  I dont think so, but what do you all think?
1369 2018-04-28 17:45:02 Would bring you some back it wouldn't keep. There is probably an ancient law about artisanally crafted Cheshire cheese not being allowed to leave the boundaries of Cheshire. I don't want to risk being put in the stocks for cheese smuggling.

1374 2018-04-28 17:35:44 Hey buttholeface, when stocks trade at all time highs, and shareholder returns are the highest in history, CEO pay hits new highs as well. Pull your head out of your anal cavity and read a book on economics. You mo mo.

Term Limits & prohibition from Stocks while in Office. They are self-serving, NOT serving the ppl. Disgraceful and no honor or integrity.
1376 2018-04-28 17:34:04 You wanna be buyers only on stocks showing strength why would you even be at weak stocks and hoping to catch bottom . It never happens

1379 2018-04-28 17:31:53 My point is you rarely get high priced stocks among smallcaps which have the longest runway for growth. And the ones that have a high price aren't really exceptional. High price is mostly a large cap phenomenon.

1382 2018-04-28 17:26:07 For me it is never. I tried it but this is a real Zero Summ game in contrast to stocks and that means what you win must others lose, but this biggest market is a real professional market where all this big Boys an Banks are in.

1407 2018-04-28 16:59:05 $200 trillion in #stocks #cash #bonds #gold around the world ... all four over-valued. If 2% of that ends up in #crypto you have a $4 trillion total market cap ... 10X where we are today. If $BTC #bitcoin holds its current market share ... that would put the price at $90,000.
1408 2018-04-28 16:58:36 Importantly we import fish we eat cos UK fishers catch stocks the continent eats - there’s more profit selling pollock to the mainland than cod to UK. If you want British-fished fish for w/e reason convince the fishers to start fishing up the ones we eat.Nothing to do with the EU
1409 2018-04-28 16:57:17 @jasonzweigwsj ‘s column in the WSJ this morning on value investing was . Reading that value stocks are only 39% more expensive than average vs. 72% for growth made me happy.
1410 2018-04-28 16:56:40 3 things I learned today on 28/ Apr:

1. Insulting people is rarely persuasive 

Encouraging them that they can see more than what they see is persuasive 

Put potential into someone’s mind, dont be punitive.

2. Boring Investment in stocks turns out to be blockbuster returns
1411 2018-04-28 16:56:21 目が見えるようになったとこで涙ちょちょぎれたし脆い
1412 2018-04-28 16:54:08 The fish are imported from EU countries but fished from the exact same stocks the UK would fish them from. There’s no such thing as a ‘French fish’ or a ‘British fish’ because fish move without consideration for borders. Who fishes them makes no difference.
1413 2018-04-28 16:53:46 We have wilrich cultivator with 4 bar spike harrow.. we pull rolling basket for worked up corn stocks to beat the root balls and pull land roller on everything else .. I like spike harrow in corn stocks but can plug in oat trash with dew on top ..
1414 2018-04-28 16:52:27 Economic inequality has worsened since regan. If you own stocks they will certainly be worth less when trump leaves office than now.

1418 2018-04-28 16:45:06 (2/2) I invest when I believe the conditions... are probably not permanent... you can't be short-term oriented with this investment philosophy. If you're going to worry about short-term volatility, you're just not going to be able to buy the cheapest stocks. -- Rich Pzena

The main task of ECB is to become a full-fledged cryptobank in Europe for 4 years. ECB creates a link between the crypto currency and standard assets, such as stocks, bonds, real estate. Good luck!

1430 2018-04-28 16:30:40 Appreciate your insights very much. For a bottom picker convert like me, these are really very helpful to learn how to track growth stocks which have already done well.
1431 2018-04-28 16:29:59 CANT BELIEVE MAY HAS CREPT UP ON US ALREADY, IT’LL BE JUNE 7th BEFORE YOU KNOW IT AND IF YOU DIDNT BUY ANY CANNABIS STOCKS / STILL HOLD THEM, I FEEL SORRY FOR YOU ... ONCE IN A LIFE TIME OPPORTUNITY TO CASH IN ... IF YOU BOUGHT AT THE RIGHT TIME $$$
1432 2018-04-28 16:29:46 Lyn, isn’t it time to drop stocks and enter crypto already? It’s pretty clear by now where the opportunity is this year.

1436 2018-04-28 16:26:12 Is #OldHeadShotDay some plot from the face-recognition-software-exploiters-you-know-who to keep beefing up their stocks and nourish the algorithms using predictive AI to figure out how we we will look like in 10-20-30 years and keep track on us? #suspicious #gdpr #darkweb
1437 2018-04-28 16:24:12 Didn’t realize people still thought of stocks that way. Reminds me of my misbegotten and largely unprofitable youth.
1438 2018-04-28 16:24:07 @RFGent1 Hogg, it’s hysterical you say the @NRA has blood on their hands yet they didn’t kill or haven’t been responsible for any killings. Yet you praise this fool Obama who approved sales of bump stocks used to massacre 58 in Vegas. Who really has blood on their hands??

1443 2018-04-28 16:16:27 If you hit on even half of these numbers within 10% you should devote more of your time and methodology to picking stocks. I’m sure you’re good at what you do but this seems like reaching WAY into the bottom of the barrel here.

1450 2018-04-28 16:01:42 Hey Gary, what’s your thoughts about investing in pot stocks market?
1451 2018-04-28 16:01:25 What happened with PC Jewellers and Vakrangee can happen with your stocks too, if you invest without due diligence.

Choose your stocks carefully.

1453 2018-04-28 15:58:32 If the Management is involved in a fraud I don’t think its easy for any auditor to detect that. Its all about the intentions# It may be any other audit firm as well! Its your personal decision whether or not to buy Pw audited stocks
1454 2018-04-28 15:56:21 FYI, there's a ugly plan to take legal pain meds from people w/chronic pain & create a HUGE new market of pot users (check #WallStreet for pot stocks-massive numbers!).

The fishing industry is a minor part of UK economy & barring a hard Brexit will be sold for bigger gains, same as the Tories did in the 70s. CFP was accepted 2preserve stocks, % of quotas were a political decision.
1460 2018-04-28 15:49:27 They may preach it but they won’t even support banning bump stocks. They’re pushing silencers in states that ban them. What law abiding citizen needs those? Why are they taking Russian money? You drank the Kool Aid.

1463 2018-04-28 15:47:28 I wouldn’t doubt it, but what’s after that? They are running out of colorways that people want. This year all they have been doing is giving people what they’ve asked for for years but where do they go from there?

The most common comment I get is 'Don't you read the paper!?' Because if you read the paper, there's no way you'd buy these stocks.
1468 2018-04-28 15:44:01 I always wanted to invest money in stocks but I was too scared. Today I made my first investment and I’m really excited to see what happens
1469 2018-04-28 15:44:00 .@VincentDeluard "Europe may be a safe place to hide"
1. EU stocks have been out performers since the start of the trade wars
2. Macron is reforming the French economy

4. The GBP is close to pre-Brexit levels
5. Eastern EU is growing at 6%+

1481 2018-04-28 15:33:49 In the future I can see a conversion of #stocks to the #blockchain which would rattle the valuation of the #crypto market.

1571 2018-04-28 13:34:15 @HSvedang Thanks 4 sharing your insight.

1718 2018-04-28 10:16:51 "far-left wing biased" . It's only a publicly traded company, that means if you want to make changes on what it 'should be' you better buy some stocks!

1720 2018-04-28 10:15:18 it's quite possible, but I suspect they overplay the amount that comes from Iran vs what was captured in the civil war. Yemen government had Scud stocks before the Houthi takeover.

1790 2018-04-28 08:54:30 M&S said it was “cognisant of current and future risks and challenges to the Scottish salmon #farming #industry”. But are clearly either not 'cognisant' and/or do not care about the effects of this #toxic & #polluting production on #wild #fish stocks & wider #marine #environment!

1800 2018-04-28 08:41:26 True, but components of the largest markets (I'm thinking primarily stocks) will tend to correlate significantly on their way down, at least in the short run. When stuff goes suddenly on sale, everyone freaks.

1825 2018-04-28 08:14:42 The so called compounding and time affect  is agnostic to type instrument used. Be it derivatives or  stocks. but usually small account cannot diversify  enough to contain market risk (in derivatives that is)
1826 2018-04-28 08:14:27 Par le passé, les stocks Apetra ont été (largement) inférieurs aux 90 jours imposés par diverses législations ; qu'en est-il aujourd'hui ? Et quelles autres formes d'énergie sont envisagées ? L'électricité ?  
1827 2018-04-28 08:14:23 I wouldnt get into any stocks until the next crash, everything is deffinately over inflated right now
1828 2018-04-28 08:14:19 If you have the stomach for stocks, but neither the time nor the inclination to do the homework, invest in equity mutual funds.

1859 2018-04-28 07:25:44 Lot of the compensation is in terms of future vesting stocks and not cash. High expenses in these places leads to lower savings. Also higher early retirement estimates due to the higher expenses. Still it shaves off quite a few years for many of their employees.
1860 2018-04-28 07:25:40 More like shortage of products  hitting the stores is driving price up causing stocks to go up. Making the markets seem like there doing better then they are. At the same time devaluing the  u.s. dollar.

1891 2018-04-28 06:48:24 The US put a bunch of restrictions on Alaskans fishing of salmon a few years ago because of shrinking stocks they said. When I know for a fact the reason is because commercial fisherman are selling millions of lbs to Asia, illegally downgrading the actual quality to do so.
1892 2018-04-28 06:44:37 The weapons you are describing have been used in about 7% of defined mass shootings since 09.  So....i mean, that doesnt include fully auto rifles outfitted with bump stocks of course.

1909 2018-04-28 06:15:16 The rationale for not suspending trading in NCLT stocks was price discovery ! How can you award promoter 90-98% stake, after having this price discovery without any concerns for the minority shareholders??

How do proponents of EMH justify these swings? What new information is being factored in on a daily basis?

1940 2018-04-28 05:33:10 The stock market can also make you poor. The key is that you need to have some starting capital to invest in stocks.  A lot of people don't make enough to live on to get their head above water.  They make us compete with global wages, but rent keeps increasing.

1946 2018-04-28 05:28:13 Well we can start with the 600 something jobs he gave back to the coal miners in Wyoming. If that’s not enough we can look at the fact that Peabody stocks went up 50% after he removed us from the pacific trade agreement.

1969 2018-04-28 04:49:32 1) once established (e.g. post hyper-btc), BTC would function more like gold did in past and not be so volatile. Compared to stocks, bonds which can drop a lot more

1994 2018-04-28 04:10:09 I think so. I think the larger financial community is getting into cryptos because they secretly suspect stocks will crash as baby boomers liquidate retirement savings to live on them and millenials don't (or can't) pick up the slack and buy into equities or bonds.

2010 2018-04-28 03:43:37 Ok, let me clarify.. that the idea of the word 'Diworsified' portfolio was picked from Lynch book. Lynch had not dictated these stock numbers. Coming to your specific question.. Lynch can have those many stocks because of the size of his portfolio, which ran to billions.
2011 2018-04-28 03:41:11 So that which shall not be infringed must be infringed if society is to continue.  The question only is one of degree of infringement.  Current debates are magazine sizes, bump stocks, and permitting.  Government can regulate that.

2038 2018-04-28 03:09:59 I'm down like 10 grand overall from where I was in February which is not that bad considering I'm still up 3.5x from my initial investment last summer when I began this adventure

2093 2018-04-28 02:01:06 @jimcramer Big fan!  I am confused about the intersection of your principles. I split my buys into at least 4 different buys. Many times the price just goes up, so I only am able to get a 25% position or I violate my basis. This has led to me owning more than 10 stocks.  Help!

2118 2018-04-28 01:17:30 Lot of my stocks I have shared around. Lupin, Divis, SBI BoB etc. I will tell you what is wrong. Every stock doesn’t perform. If some buys watching 1-2 picks & those go wrong, they lose money coz they won’t have other winners. Also there is no follow up if I sold or bought back
2119 2018-04-28 01:17:17 I call it fishing. Take defensive stocks down so there is allowable rotation in future plans. Usually great shorts if you catch them early enough. Decent buys when bear flags fail, usually 50% of retrace.

2140 2018-04-28 00:49:02 Apparently the stocks of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google are collectively being referred to as FANG stocks by traders. Because that doesn't make them collectively sound like the bad guys from an 80's cartoon or anything.

2145 2018-04-28 00:42:17 A fair concern, but on the other hand floaties have trouble taking stocks without losing their own. Consider the out of the top 6, Armada’s average stock remaining per game is the lowest. Not to mention some of the most stunning crew performances are from spacies

2151 2018-04-28 00:28:28 Unemployment is down no different than why stocks have  soared. Businesses have confidence in the markets, rolled back BS regulation, gave them a growth plan through much lower taxes. Obama did nothing but KILL our economy with regulation & taxes.

2157 2018-04-28 00:23:35 So how about this, the rich get a billion dollar tax break, corporations are buying back their stocks and giving investors big money. Now HUD's-Ben Carson says the poor and disabled have to pay more for their housing to encourage them to work. WOW! (Ephesians 6:10-13)
2158 2018-04-28 00:23:13 Zuckerberg's expected to surpass Bill Gates! Facebook stocks up! Just facts...
2159 2018-04-28 00:20:59 The slide downward? Company buy backs; who are they buying the stocks back from? answer, willing sellers. The stock market is an auction, there has to be willing byers and sellers. What do the sellers do with the money? What ever they want; typically they reinvest it. Capitalism!

2167 2018-04-28 00:07:09 Hi Paul, I bought into your program last October, 2017. I bought all the stocks on your buy list. So far, I lost about 14% on the ORA sale. I’m now going to loose 15% on CY. The portfolio is currently under water 4.5%. So far, this is not looking good.

2170 2018-04-28 00:01:51 If you have money sitting aside and don’t know what to do with it, invest it. Mutual funds. Stocks. Bonds. Whatever floats your boat. Because someday you might need your fallback game to be strong with no one to tell you jack... as a woman.
2171 2018-04-28 00:01:44 Niggaz was watching stocks in elementary school. That’s wild right?
2172 2018-04-28 00:01:32 Yea I do but I don’t have the hard to borrow set up so I can only short mostly large cap stocks, apparently you need to have over 100k to get their HTB program.

2179 2018-04-27 23:43:03 Be patient. How much do you think is supposed to happen in barely a year? And investing in stocks isn't exclusive to the wealthy. Look, Trump annoys me sometimes and he wasn't my choice in the primaries, but has done well. Denying his accomplishment is unreasonable.

2220 2018-04-27 23:21:48 Hello Mark, I bought your 2 books. I am happy to inform you that your risk management style helps me to control my losses at this bearish market. I am trading in Philippine stocks exchange. I read the first book twice especially the last 2 chapters about risk management. Thanks!
2221 2018-04-27 23:19:56 Dirt Street Stocks. Say what yall want bout them being slow but some of my most fun races come from this class.
2222 2018-04-27 23:19:45 Exports will have a significant impact on carryover stocks. U.S. carryover will fall to some 4.2-4.4 million bales and world carryover to some 86-87 million bales.  Too, world stocks are expected to drop in 2018-19 and this is the basis for expecting new crop above 80 cents.
2223 2018-04-27 23:19:20 Sucker stocks no thanks
2224 2018-04-27 23:12:20 Oh yeah. For US multinational corps & stocks, & Chinese Corps & stocks, but not US GDP. Bear mind China apparently had a lot to do with the Korean Penninsula peace treaty, most likely with the objective of expanding trade. Think Asian markets will open more - not less.

2226 2018-04-27 23:11:48 Please do not buy or consume fish and other seafood, or any animal meat or by-products for that matter.. it's simply not needed in the human diet!

Worldwide "Seafood" exporters which supports the global overfishing of the oceans and destroy the fish stocks for greed.

2228 2018-04-27 23:07:13 Depends also on whether you want to trade a lot/ build positions in certain stocks.Personally prefer to work be patient and decide to trade/invest.
Being dependent on making money can lead to cutting corners and making mistakes,equally you can miss out by not being full time

2231 2018-04-27 23:05:57 Pony Stocks qualifications had Ryan Hollister @HollisterRacing with fast time at 15.203. William Larner and Jarin Larner are the top three. We have a little work to do to figure out who is running the outlaw class vs the stock class, but we will get it soon enough.
2232 2018-04-27 23:00:17 1/ So you are leaning toward USD cleanest shirt in the dirty laundry, lots of USD debt out there in the world needs repayment. US switching to QT drinks world's milkshake. However QT and raising rates also makes bonds more attractive than very highly price stocks.
2233 2018-04-27 22:56:52 Scott Pemberton @ScoPem51 is quick time in the Performance Automotive Northwest Spartan Stocks with a 13.724/ Bob Bauer and Tim Lahar were the top three.
2234 2018-04-27 22:56:44 Well, be glad that you live in the real world. I see no difference down here since Trump came into office. It's still status quo. 
People who occupied certain positions still do. Rich people have benefited from Trump, especially, in the stocks. They're about all that I can see.

Sur un semestre ça fait un bon 1% et sur an à ce rythme c'est un bon 2%, pas vrai ?

2278 2018-04-27 21:52:59 I think China and NK had more to do with ending Korean war. Trump out foxed by Kim. NK had very meager stocks of ICBMs and nuclear warheads. It was all bombast and loud B.S. to get Trump to negotiation table. A well planned scheme that fooled all of Trump's neocons.

2280 2018-04-27 21:50:50 When a stock goes up 250%+ up consecutively for 4 days in a row -25% is not a big deal. But based on what I know about this company this  stock is well worth .20 to .25 right of the bat. I am sure this stock will trial between .05 to .10 cents until we hear news from the company
2281 2018-04-27 21:50:16 You have the mentality , profitability will come. I tell most new trader to stay away from the 10$ and under stocks, the guys alerting them are taking your money. Trade names like these with a couple hundred shares and profits will come TSLA, NVDA, AMZN, AAPL. Good luck
2282 2018-04-27 21:49:12 Today it's #Day106 of #365daysofvalue. I analyzed LyondellBasell. The share price is $106. What's your opinion? #valueinvesting #investing #stocks #TwitterPoll
2283 2018-04-27 21:46:37 Stoked for you; is funny that failed hedge fund manager/failed short seller is now charging money to teach people how to run a hedge fund and short stocks! Great line-up of speakers (you included), but having smart friends didn't translate into good returns for him. Buyer beware.
2284 2018-04-27 21:46:07 Weird. During the campaign he insisted he had sold all his stocks, was holding nothing. So what has he sold short on when he's done crappy stories about companies? Steel. Amazon. Boeing.  .............????
2285 2018-04-27 21:45:56 If I were you I would look at the BRK.B Shares they are the same bundle of stocks at 1/1000 of the price. Much more liquid, and you can buy/sell options.  You could also trade SPY it’s an ETF of the S&P 500, options-dividend.  Jim would likely give you the same advice.
2286 2018-04-27 21:44:45 People still buy stocks?
2287 2018-04-27 21:44:15 I should buy some chipotle stocks

2290 2018-04-27 21:43:11 What’s your thoughts on defense stocks I loaded like a funny before ER & NK announcement so bought high. Hold for the next few weeks & suck it up or take the loss and move on bc it will be some time before they pickup steam again? Thanks
2291 2018-04-27 21:41:30 Jerry Jones got a shit ton of oil stocks in a new deal and y'all say he is racist. Trump as said racist is deeply tied to oil.. I believe the racist white folks just want money and power and nothing will stop them cause we just wanna work for them to play with petty cash they pay
2292 2018-04-27 21:41:26 This is the situation faced by those who operate in the multi asset space. Equity indexes have pairwise correlations close to 1, but correlations between stocks and bonds, or gold, or commodities, etc. sometimes stray into negative territory. And vols are wildly different.
2293 2018-04-27 21:40:42 they were all beats. biggest stocks beat at every metric. no places to fix, so must continue to perform at higher bar. price will tell us. let's see how the next couple weeks plays out.
2294 2018-04-27 21:38:43 Hopefully this helps their stocks go up
2295 2018-04-27 21:38:28 @AskRobinhood Can you buy and sell stocks using Robinhood web? Or do you have to use the app?
2296 2018-04-27 21:38:18 $DNKN versus $SBUX it's one of my favorite past-times. I enjoyed their coffees and pastries, but their stocks are more fun to follow. Quietly, Dunkin above $60 while Starbucks studders in the $50s.
2297 2018-04-27 21:38:03 Evening Market Wrap-up: stocks close flat as tech drags and the S&P finds upper resistance. PEP Options filled at an average of $3.83 and looking for lower support.
2298 2018-04-27 21:37:54 If there is small dispersion between pairwise correlations, and the assets that meet your criteria for investment have roughly equal expected Sharpe ratios, then inverse volatility is reasonable. Such is the case for individual stocks, sectors, equity indexes.
2299 2018-04-27 21:37:04 Of course the CEOs are silent -#GOPTaxscam allowing the 0.01% , CEOs included, to basically raid the treasury and to buy back their stocks. Rich getting richer under Trump, middle class dissolving and poor getting poorer under Trump. What a shocker #BlueWave2018

2320 2018-04-27 21:23:12 Nope. I have a job. I work in the poorest part of San Francisco; I see what people are going through. Trump is riding on Obama’s coat tails. Unemployment was declining steadily, and stocks were rising already. Now stocks are down. The tax cut disproportionately favored the rich.
2321 2018-04-27 21:23:12 @sullivanradio The bank will require retail clients to only sell guns if the customer has passed a background check, to restrict sales to people under 21, and to refuse to sell bump stocks or high-capacity magazines. Citigroup didnt touch any1's 2nd amendment right
2322 2018-04-27 21:22:35 So bitcoin is part of a 0.4T market cap of crypto 'stocks'. We have gold, our fav relic, at about 8T as highly liquid market benchmark. Gold is about 3 to 4% to global debt and real estate. A projected 20X resulting for BTC @ $180,000.- #revision #prediction

2327 2018-04-27 21:18:31 Whilst I agree that they are amazing animals I do question their sustainability in this tiny river / stream. This river has only just survived pollution and its fish stocks are spartan. Has this otter migrated through river systems or been released locally.
2328 2018-04-27 21:15:40 yeah no thank you, i believe people should be free to do what they want to do with what they have to do it with. Fuck him and all the people that think like him. They are thankfully becoming irrelevant laughing stocks to most gamers.
2329 2018-04-27 21:14:35 Was so strange to see $CCO cease trading before earnings conference call came to an end. On silver lining side, $URA was up nearly 2% which could lead to more Global X Uranium ETF units being created on Monday by Credit Suisse, their AP. Could light fire under TSX U stocks.

2371 2018-04-27 20:47:46 1) Great post. My hunch is that value doesn’t win but at some point, growth loses. Value stocks are more expensive than they’ve ever been. The margin of safety for buying a business with poor prospects that the market has over-reacted to isn’t there.

2399 2018-04-27 20:27:08 I say that's the high life  the best  how bout you   certain stocks pay dividends  very rare nowadays  like a pittance per  share   less than the share
2400 2018-04-27 20:26:22 Folks hold stocks hoping they'll come back. Good thing about options is they expire, so no need to deal with that dilemma. $SPY $SPX $STUDY
2401 2018-04-27 20:24:35 Stocks & Bonds in my outlook will always be a great way  invest your money.
2402 2018-04-27 20:20:05 This will probably go on until all the stocks prices that went up parabolically little by little settle into what the market truly deems the right price.  Looking at the charts, it becomes obvious which stocks still have to be adjusted before all moves back up
2403 2018-04-27 20:19:53 Canadian "Pot Stocks". 
2404 2018-04-27 20:19:52 World stocks edged higher: US +.1%; Europe +.2%. If market retains its focus on earning prices should move higher. Caveat: Unusually strong 1Q earnings could lead to disappointment even if 2Q earnings solid. Barring increased trade or political turmoil 2018 should be fine.

2430 2018-04-27 20:05:21 Great call by Wayne .. but I find it weird how all the gurus that teach to chase low float stocks never post anything when there is an actual setup. Best chatroom .. greatstockpix
2431 2018-04-27 20:04:57 This discussion reminds me of quote from a business program" If the price of stocks go up, anchors would find an analyst who predicated it, if price goes down they will find the one who predicated it" Always a win win situation 
2432 2018-04-27 20:04:30 Going to nail and bail after 1 or 2 trades. Stick to stocks priced $2.50 - $8 and i know emotions are going to be bigger than before so need to curb them as best i can.. i guess i need to remember it is points and not money
2433 2018-04-27 20:04:23 Do you think the big drop in February was just because people want the market to go down? There is a lot of positive data but how much better can it get? people are trying to be out before things potentially get nasty and maybe they don't want to commit to stocks with 3 % rate
2434 2018-04-27 20:03:49 is it possible to review specific politicians holdings in stocks or other financial interest in corporations?
2435 2018-04-27 20:03:25 I was driving to work listening to radio4 and they had an item with a 12 year old boy called  Jacob Reece-Mogg talking about his stocks and shares ... shouldn't he have been playing football , computer games , lego or anything else ..  what a childhood he had !

2438 2018-04-27 20:00:50 How management communicates mistakes is very important. No one is mistake-free - as investors 40% of the stocks we buy underperform the market - and I'd be concerned about any company where shareholder communication doesn't include a candid assessment of mistakes. - Bill Nygren

2499 2018-04-27 19:16:34 Exactly. I'm not selling a coin although I agree with Jim that Gold either stall or fall when stocks dump in the Fall. However Gold and silver will likely soar thereafter when the Fed and global CBs reverse course to QE infinity IMHO. Those in the know will vacuum physical.

2525 2018-04-27 19:01:00 Inv's have option of 2 stocks.  Option 1 has risen 42% in the last year, and has a 12% upside. Option 2, is trading near its all time lows, with a 300% upside. Hand over fist, they're buying option 1, b/c option 2 is much too risky for them. That's the very def of blind trades.

2530 2018-04-27 18:57:12 Much of the impact of QE was psychological in giving people the incentive to buy stocks on the belief that the Fed had their back. The result was not a non event with historic valuations that followed. The reverse will also not be a non event as valuations revert.

The estimated net worth includes stocks, properties, and luxury goods such as yachts and private airplanes. This is not how to drain the swamp!
2553 2018-04-27 18:38:27 Or perhaps stocks are just radically overvalued.
2554 2018-04-27 18:38:08 As for $CSCO and even more overvalued dot com stocks from the 1990’s. I can measure & forecast their sustainable EPS est revision deltas. They were horrible then.

AUDJPY tends to be a risk proxy pair (AUD is commodity backed, JPY safe haven). IMO we are going to have a bulltrap on stocks, so that should push AUDJPY up, catch people buying an upside breakout, then shift down and catch support buyers

2664 2018-04-27 17:19:45 Owing to the decline of fish stocks, British chefs including Heston Blumenthal and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall are attempting to raise awareness of alternative seafoods, by championing scampi[10] and other lesser-known seafood dishes as a more sustainable source of protein.

2673 2018-04-27 17:17:10 Mid-Day: Stocks rebound and are trading in positive territory.  MBS is up 14bps and Yields are hovering between 2.95% and 2.96%.
2674 2018-04-27 17:16:38 I agree to that being the reason ultra-boost was popular. No one can really deny that. But what I'm saying is that was THEN... adidas doesn't NEED Kanye now. I would probably argue that even back then Kanye needed adidas just as much (if not more).

2680 2018-04-27 17:14:14 There are exceptions and the leaders will break out earlier. If the whole stock market is in a downtrend or choppy sideways consolidation, single stocks are choppy, too. If you are #trading long-term it has a lower impact.

2790 2018-04-27 16:18:01 As a footnote, optimization is unhelpful for large and relatively homogeneous universes like stocks, sectors, or equity indexes, and for illiquid assets.

So like most things, it requires a little art, and depends on the situation.

Lots more to come in forthcoming article.

2798 2018-04-27 16:12:08 That would be good but some semi automatic private owners get so defensive w/this issue & they'll go over the top & claim that they'll lose all gun privileges. This isn't the issue.The deal is responsible gun reform & getting semis & bump stocks & such out of public availability.
2799 2018-04-27 16:11:59 Eh? This is a poor analogy. Capital gains aren't ever taxed on primary residences. And stocks don't receive muni services like fire, police, waste removal, water/sewer, educational, etc so why would we tax them annually?

2892 2018-04-27 15:26:23 @thecloudguy $SPY Easy, overnight profits to be taken, especially for those trading based on upcoming earnings of their favorite stocks.
2893 2018-04-27 15:24:31 Also bump stocks make them essentially automatic. What's the US childish fixation with owning guns when you have the highest gun murder rate in the developed world? It's almost like access to high powered weapons is causing more deaths than its preventing
2894 2018-04-27 15:24:19 I agree. I've seen so many overt (covert) ways they use to minimize and/or silence Conservative voices, particularly on social media.
To be honest, I'll be glad when Trump is done with social media, so I and many others can deactivate accounts and watch their stocks drop.

2916 2018-04-27 15:13:51 when I was a young whippersnapper and stocks were under real pressure, fixed income folks would buy Bills and 2's. Today's crowd grabs bonds, and like Bill mentioned, its a m/e thing too.
BTW, stks might as well be unchanged, 10 or 20 points in spoos is just noise.
2917 2018-04-27 15:13:05 4 months in 2018, with the biggest tax cut in history we are either flat or negative for most the major stocks. Where do you think we will end 2018 market on average? $XLF $BAC $JPM

2919 2018-04-27 15:10:57 I see California as a "value stock". Texas, Tennessee, etc. are "growth stocks".

They need *more* people, infrastructure, etc. 

We don't need growth as much as we need to keep our value. And we are: unlike states like Kansas, we balance our budget while maintaining our state.
2920 2018-04-27 15:10:16 Stocks should probably end higher today on the great news from Korea. No more war in Asia!

2926 2018-04-27 15:08:44 With how risky and volatile the penny stock market is you have to do your research. Penny stocks are highly prone to insider trading, and pumping/dumping. Unless you have disposable income to invest the risk isn't worth it. Just my 2 cents though.

2928 2018-04-27 15:07:44 Everybody cites $FB as a "valuation play." But big leading stocks often become "cheap" in terms of P/E just before they top...it shows that its future earnings stream is less valued by the market...

2956 2018-04-27 14:57:33 I think some of the selling was the retail rush into speculative stocks in January and now they are underwater and can't take the red stress. They have capitulated and finally accepted their loss and moved on.

2965 2018-04-27 14:52:58 @CNBC ok we are over halfway through #earnings and as expected lots of big beats but especially today stocks flat or selling good news as we are in a  #bearmarket.

Alot of people made alot of money in 2017 as alot of them loss . So good bet taxes were alot more than thought .  Others used a tax loss . So could be the reason why we see selling off of some stocks . To pay taxes . Usually don't see tax loss selling this early
3075 2018-04-27 14:08:18 If you can't use it to aim at a target, it is not an "arm." It is a toy.

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

Ban bump stocks.

3182 2018-04-27 13:27:07 This looks like a typical MM tactic designed to create
a panic sell off. Gap it up only to take it down to yesterday's
previous close and then some. But then again watch me
be wrong. =)

3216 2018-04-27 13:12:05 Fair point - may be relevant if you one defense-related stocks.   If you don't, hard to see how it is a negative for broad market.

3250 2018-04-27 12:58:06 The shorts will be all over this trying to hype it. After all,  a proposal by a guy with 12 shares of stocks is a serious threat to Musk. (For the sarcasm-impared, that was sarcasm).
3251 2018-04-27 12:57:48 Actually I have a theory that Trump & senior gop have secret dining room table & phone booth companies. And also likely security Headhunters & a door co. They just want nominees that have a penchant for blowing tax money on specific things...Maybe also private air stocks...

3258 2018-04-27 12:53:18 First thing to observe is that the calls given by Pandey has no stop loss and the fun is he seems to hv no idea where the stock is heading, he will ask you to hold the stock and once you start blaming him if the stocks goes down he will start claiming that the stop loss is 2 %.

3295 2018-04-27 12:28:46 I would recommend it if the stocks are solid DGI. At that point your just locking in profits and purchasing good companies at 52 week lows.

3301 2018-04-27 12:20:50 Your “perimeter” idea isn’t accurate. Cheaper and more nutrient dense foods like brown rice, quinoa, beans, broth, soups and most ethnic foods are inside. My grocery actually hacks your tip and stocks junk around the perimeter.

3406 2018-04-27 10:43:23 Lately I've been considering selling some profitable stocks to relocate the money to stocks which are attractively priced, in order to buy more into growth or better yield, If I can't manage to buy back the stock I sell for a better price, there is always other stocks. Thoughts?
3407 2018-04-27 10:43:00 I'm intrigued by the divergence from the trend of bitcoin and the general markets declining together.

It is possible that it's a headfake or it is also possible that cryptocurrencies are gaining interest as a hedge when both stocks and bonds are declining.

3409 2018-04-27 10:42:07 Rates matter even more at market extremes. High rates combined with high stock prices crashed the markets in 2000/2008/2018. Record low rates/cheap stocks fueled the 2003-2007 and 2009-2017 market advances.
3410 2018-04-27 10:41:36 Agreed, but Welfare to Work is the entire infrastructure, Jobcentres, Programmes, Providers. In 2008-9 new claims for benefit very similar to 1991-2, unemployment stocks lower as the infrastructure worked. Would it work now?
3411 2018-04-27 10:40:29 Both of them (together) Must have bought quality stocks by creating chaos in the recent past.

3415 2018-04-27 10:36:39 Two reasons I can think of:

Total growth, ex-dividends, over the last 30-months or so has been about 4%

3672 2018-04-27 06:30:41 It's not a capital gain. You have to sell and profit. Should the govt tax stocks before you sell and realize a profit because the market is up during a point in time? Let's say the tax is implemented, does it get refunded due to a crash caused by gov't intervention?
3673 2018-04-27 06:30:09 I know that @sofain likes crypto - very volatile investment instruments. Options (you may buy/sell stocks at a price for a price) are often volatile as well, but you can time them - the market usually surges in the morning and declines in the evening.

3892 2018-04-27 02:53:49 But good fundamentals trump technicals for these type of Bio stocks.   So these H&S could mean nothing in the interim.  I remember about 6 months ago when most were praising this

3953 2018-04-27 01:55:20 Those of who worked and had insurance as a measure of compensation got slammed with higher deductibles and co-pays. In other words, we got to pay for other people so they can enter into a private economic transaction and pay squat.

3959 2018-04-27 01:49:38 I am highlighting risks. That's what I do, as a risk manager in an environment where money is tighter. 
That doesn't mean I don't buy value stocks for long term periods.  I have a number of core positions I will not sell unless a stock specific reason occurs:
3960 2018-04-27 01:49:16 I would go back to 1995 and buy a lot of Apple stocks
3961 2018-04-27 01:49:15 Futures reminding everyone that one or two stocks doesn’t matter
3962 2018-04-27 01:48:48 These Digitization era stocks trading at crazy PEs and yet they shock market with their earnings.
Results come out and FB pops 9%. Then Amazon numbers come out and it pops 6%. Yes this is for real
3963 2018-04-27 01:46:22 Big 10% earnings pops higher in big stocks BUT futures are down tonight and for the week so far, that is Bearish....no way to spin it otherwise....sell.  $SPY $DIA $NDX
3964 2018-04-27 01:44:55 His buys show he is moving towards safer stocks, as he himself said, now mkt may not reward with multibagger returns as last year, so time for higher safety stocks. Its a dynamic view of the mkt given the run-up to the Gen election in 2019 is a year away.
3965 2018-04-27 01:43:21 You are delusional or just plain disengenuous about pushing a non viable option on a business. Farms aren’t depressing wild stocks...killing a productive industry won’t save wild salmon at all...

3982 2018-04-27 01:28:25 En el tuit que retuitaste, hablaba de flujos comerciales. Pero con liquidación no obligatoria, ni siquiera existen los flujos estrictamente comerciales: toda decisión de cambios (incluso la del exportador) es una decisión de portafolio, es decir, una decisión sobre stocks.
3983 2018-04-27 01:27:57 Not exactly news is it? There are thousands of things that may go into setting up a stock exchange identification of stocks by giving them a number is well just a bit arbitrary.
3984 2018-04-27 01:27:04 To point out the issue with bump stocks the issue with them is how to produce a legal definition that only targets them.  Like they are currently legal only because of how semi automatic is defined.

Attempts to ban it have failed as all the definitions would have banned more
3985 2018-04-27 01:25:26 Only one of my professors ever talked politics. I was an economics major. We did discuss monetary policies of administrations. But never express opinions of POTUS foreign policy etc.
3986 2018-04-27 01:23:38 @whitehouse @realdonaldtrump: Your bump stock regulations will place you to the left of the gun-hating Obama on this issue. I stand with @GunOwners and urge you to not regulate bump stocks.

3988 2018-04-27 01:22:06 Unless the class is discussing politics as a whole. Or you're in a political science class. It is inappropriate for a professor to express their political pov. In my opinion.

4004 2018-04-27 01:04:39 A lot...now the haters will rip me for telling me that stocks can remain irrational longer than I can remain solvent.

4006 2018-04-27 01:02:47 So I’ve made the goal to put money toward trading buttttt I’m going to make extra money and use that. For example, I cashed in credit card rewards a bought stocks today.

4023 2018-04-27 00:51:04 That was a great market . But nothing has ever compared to post GFC  when very good stocks were thrown out with everything else.  BHP got down to around $14 just a couple of years ago from memory.

In good times lots of stocks spike ,in poor times nearly everything gets punished
4024 2018-04-27 00:49:24 Y’all really be spending all that money on that designer shit when you could invest in some stocks and flip that money

4028 2018-04-27 00:48:47 Jesus no, never again. For starters changing my stocks data feed. Never seen anything this ridiculous before.
4029 2018-04-27 00:47:49 Everyone knows t-Shirts, underwear and socks should only be purchased from startups founded by an ex-Apple engineer. Your typo "stocks" instead of "socks" may be Freudian.
4030 2018-04-27 00:47:22 Clearly wut I'm sayin is losing u. We've seen it plenty of time over in business. A company has good standing, ppl love it. Said company pulls a stunt like Kanye for example, loses a large amount of it's standing, stocks drop company goes outta business
4031 2018-04-27 00:46:34 I have hope....and a lot of red in my account  lollllll

4037 2018-04-27 00:43:58 How about a "responsible, convenient, and safe manner" manner to rid our country of semi-automatic weapons, high-capacity magazines, and bump stocks that kill children. Or is your precious NRA money too good?
4038 2018-04-27 00:40:40 In contradictory moves both bonds and stocks rallied, reflecting ECB message of a positive outlook but no removal of monetary support. The Euro weakened & USD rallied @MicMcCarthy_CMC
4039 2018-04-27 00:40:31 It’s setting up for the Broncos to draft Josh Allen and, if it happens, @BroomfieldHoops will be camping out at Mile High until the team store stocks his jersey.

4041 2018-04-27 00:39:56 Very true - stops save u- no deadly trades if you stick to stops - stocks that go up 82.00 in a day...guarantee somebody got walloped today adding to their short all the way up
4042 2018-04-27 00:39:13 1 yr after starting my stock market journey:
-Am I profitable? Not yet
-Did I improve? Drastically
-More red days or green days? More green days
-Have I influenced people to start trading? Yes!
-Have I taught people how to screen stocks? Yes!
4043 2018-04-27 00:37:53 Lol. For now hope is all I got.. 
4044 2018-04-27 00:36:56 They have to get their money back so how. @realDonaldTrump help plunge the stocks. 
4045 2018-04-27 00:36:21 Don’t complain about working for the white man if your gonna spend the money you make recklessly. Ppl rather buy the latest shoe instead of investing in stocks! #levelup
4046 2018-04-27 00:36:15 You're already making stacks in stocks no need to do it on cod 
4047 2018-04-27 00:35:39 VET is one of those stocks I picked up in the 2015 bottom and have been holding ever since. Pays a good dividend and decent appreciation. Think the Spartan deal made them that much better. Could pull back temporarily, but see this easily going back to the 2016 highs.
4048 2018-04-27 00:35:33 The key word is "rumor", not a fan of that word haha but yes, I hope so as well.
4049 2018-04-27 00:32:10 bump stocks make accuracy irrelevant that is the problem domestic abuse gun bans should only be for convictions and agree on mental illness
4050 2018-04-27 00:32:07 I really dislike the commentators and draft stocks stuff .. they just be talking out they neck

EUR AND GBP BIGGEST FALLS VS USD OVERNIGHT AS ECB CONTINUE QE PAST SEP 2018. U.S. STOCKS HIGHER WITH FACEBOOK +9% AS USD REMAINS STRONG. TODAY WE HAVE BOJ MTG SO EXPECT SOME JUMPY PRICE ACTION WITH THE RELEASE BUT EXPECT NO POLICY CHANGE. AUD LEVELS 0.7530-70 TODAY.

4057 2018-04-27 00:26:33 I’m really curious and excited to see the real-world results of the #GDPR requirement that organizations notify regulatory authorities of data breach within 72 hours of discovery. How ever will executives dump their stocks in time?
4058 2018-04-27 00:25:10 SO frustrating they believed it (were retiring right when it kicked in) they believed what was told by FOX. But you know my GP told them don't sell your stocks..GP lost 300K they lost 75K said ride it out but they pulled out lol GP died with 1.2 M in stocks. They never recouped.
4059 2018-04-27 00:23:29 don't let him in! He's gonna take all the stocks :/
4060 2018-04-27 00:23:25 Goodmorning to our dear EXOLs, we receive an overwhelming amount of reservations for the ref magnets since last night, and because limited ang stocks, those na hindi na namin marereplyan, it would be first come first serve basis na po for the remaining stocks. :)
4061 2018-04-27 00:21:55 I mean everyone hates Trump be he’s lowered the government tax on your paycheck and increased revenue for stocks while making the national unemployment rate decrease people be hating everything the man does just like people did with Obama you just need to research shit then make
4062 2018-04-27 00:18:59 Now you have just gone off the rails with silliness. Guess you haven’t seen the record breaking stocks market, low unemployment rate, gdp, tax cuts, North Korea on the brink of historic meeting. Obama was using his pen & phone & partying in the White House.
4063 2018-04-27 00:17:47 @zzee @zbreima yes yes I’m talking regular stocks. Even BKNG doesn’t make 150 moves

4070 2018-04-27 00:10:18 I tweeted a gif that DL said would upset Kelly. I said might lose an oreo. Kelly stocks the basement with oreos. When Kelly came back she said I lost multiple oreos, but I think she issued judgment before seeing the gif.
4071 2018-04-27 00:07:55 Right.  As if those tax cuts haven’t already benefitted the ultra rich.  They waisted no time buying back stocks, raising CEO pay, and passing along their inheritances. They knew it was a boon and likely not to be repeated. My kid will pay for that!
4072 2018-04-27 00:07:53 @whitehouse @realdonaldtrump: Your bump stock regulations will place you to the left of the gun-hating Obama on this issue. I stand with @GunOwners and urge you to not regulate bump stocks.
4073 2018-04-27 00:07:40 Save up at least half of it, invest in stocks with a quarter, and use the left overs to cover expenses. If I waited a bit I could do everything on the list. Blankets would be nice.
4074 2018-04-27 00:07:26 Let's see Paris Climate Agreement, putting states in charge of National Parks, DACA, & offshore drilling. There's 4 for you. Class dismissed. Do your own homework as I am not here to do it for you. Knowledge is power, arm yourself. #MAGA
4075 2018-04-27 00:06:01 They can take the dividends they receive and hire more PhD's to create new models (as well as support staff) that justify printing more money to buy stocks.  Bingo....1000s of jobs potentially created.
4076 2018-04-27 00:05:45 David-putting your fortune teller hat on for a moment and assuming stocks do crash in the fall as you think what path do you predict gold goes from here (again merely guessing)? i.e. assuming we bottom here very soon, what possible up and down path over the next 12 months or so?
4077 2018-04-27 00:05:32 October. This is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to speculate in stocks in. The others are July, January, September, April, November, May, March, June, December, August, and February.
4078 2018-04-27 00:05:18 Hahahahaha. The two of you are laughing stocks!  Just like your swamp monster boss!

4080 2018-04-27 00:03:11 Inside tip: Mock draft stocks are about to nosedive.
4081 2018-04-27 00:03:05 He also said it following the completion of the third lower high for the year, and, eight days bouncing off/near the 200-day moving average this year. The NYSE of 1900 stocks is equally shady. Not exactly firm footing.
4082 2018-04-27 00:02:48 #ARCM A lot of stocks that had been beaten down are springing back to life. I suspect strong buyers will join the party at some point. Maybe not immediately, but there is a lot of interest surrounding this particular stock.
4083 2018-04-27 00:02:32 I actually know someone who lost big on Bernie . . . Madoff. I have my money invested in pizza stocks.

4085 2018-04-27 00:01:41 Also that's why it's better to Airbnb and buy rental properties. Agree that buying a house for yourself is usually not a good investment. Renting it out especially for short term rentals is better than the stock market, have made more past year then ever with stocks
