0 2018-08-15 23:55:37 I know you make the point of trading unknown picks for known commodities, but since the Knicks aren't close to contending, I'd prefer they keep the `19 and `20 firsts. I'd be ok with trading firsts after then cause they'd be closer to contending.

4 2018-08-15 23:41:18 The commodities market are literally a creation of the USDA, without those it is impossible to know what form grocery stores would take... Might have been hard to get out of the peasant economy.
5 2018-08-15 23:34:22 Historically, there has been a bull market in the commodities every 20 or 30 years.
6 2018-08-15 23:28:20 Lol. 7 yrs, oh my. I bought at the bottom 2yrs ago. As for the rest of these commodities? Check @quakes99  latest post, #uranium is the only commodity rising and you're complaining!
7 2018-08-15 23:27:56 Going to be a harsh day today for resource stocks with commodities down sharply overnight:

Zinc: -6.4%
Nickel: -4.06%
Tin: -3.91%
Coking Coal: -3.33%
Aluminum: -2.05%
Gold: -0.26% to US$1181

Time to buy or is there more to pain come?
8 2018-08-15 23:23:30 US stocks take biggest tumble in weeks, global equities and commodities sink as lira soars 7 percent against the dollar on Turkey's trade countermoves and Qatar's pledge of $15 billion in investments

10 2018-08-15 23:17:55 But tomorrow I will not need to buy toilet tissue or bird cage liner.  I will have their " free press" to thank for supplying those commodities.
11 2018-08-15 23:16:12 So, counter post to be grateful for what I've got:
Health, my 4 limbs good enough, some real good friends like @MitchieDT , @__Hex_  and also @OGSaltBreaker , both parents alive, not big economical problems and access to some commodities. Thanks for everyone who interacts with me
12 2018-08-15 23:15:10 I'm tired of " gifts". Been in this market for years! If you didn't get in after 7 years the train needs to leave you. I want to see performance like the rest of these commodities!! It's been long enough, damn it!
13 2018-08-15 23:11:27 Lol how much was Mercedes Benz when it was first made?? How much was the first loaf of bread since we want to go that route, the issue is under pdp the was a systematic rise in price of commodities unlike what happened in the last 3 years
14 2018-08-15 23:09:15 $MU vs other commodities :) 

but another serious stat if you don't mind graphing it - I feel like MU has these 20 percent pullbacks followed by 40 percent gains in a very brief time. Am I right?
15 2018-08-15 22:59:03 In their individual prices: as their number increases, so does the sum of the values of the commodities.

17 2018-08-15 22:53:37 Looks like a bear market across the board for resources/commodities, energy which has been immune seems to be taking a hit now too. Not pretty out there
18 2018-08-15 22:43:21 To Facebook, news, pictures of your kids, and a can of Coke are simply shiny baubles to get you to come and do something. 

They don’t care about any of them any more than millers cared about grist.

40 2018-08-15 22:34:55 Hi Ivana, I work with several analysts at @RaboWholesale who can talk about how trade tensions are impacting food commodities. LMK if you're interested.
41 2018-08-15 22:33:38 I read this the opposite way: as an indictment of 21st-century entrepreneurial culture: that we injure ourselves by turning ourselves into commodities.
42 2018-08-15 22:28:52 Hindi paba tayo kawawa ngayon? Look around u.. Sobrang mahal na nang basic commodities for the govt to raise funds.. Funds for what? Yung mga infrastructures na binibuild ngayon came from the the past admin pa..
43 2018-08-15 22:24:39 @madaznfootballr    Don’t be limited to just the penny stock market.   Learn how to make money in equities, forex, and commodities.  You will never have to worry about making money ever again.  Everyday there are ridiculous opportunities in equities (options) and forex.
44 2018-08-15 22:23:38 Time to reveal my analyst coffee test. Every time you visit an E&P, accept the cup of coffee. Low cost producer wins in commodities. Don't be impressed with the latte. Cherish the burnt drop coffee in the styrofoam cup. Spending culture speaks volumes, IMO. @EnergyCredit1
45 2018-08-15 22:21:45 Markets are already reacting. Commodities are in a bear market  because of fear that the trade war will hurt global growth. It's your baby, Mr. Trump. You've tanked Iran, Turkey, and China, and damaged Europe. Do you really think we'll be fine while everyone else crashes?
46 2018-08-15 22:19:33 Specious argument made on behalf of all entry level employees in any industry where ownership reaps the lion share of profits and benefits. Minor league players are commodities - readily replaceable like servers at Mc Donald’s
47 2018-08-15 22:19:23 drumpf has no 'friends'... sociopaths see everyone as an objects or commodities to be used.
48 2018-08-15 22:08:21 Azeez, there is reduction in price. Just that the olodos don't know the inflation index is a basket of numerous commodities and therefore an average.
49 2018-08-15 22:08:15 Apparently being a commodities trader in the city and being educated at Dulwich College somehow makes him a man of the people. Strange world.
50 2018-08-15 22:07:29 Just saw Cramer talking about commodities dropping. Lumber at lows. Hmm is this not a tailwind. Just an observation.

52 2018-08-15 22:01:39 $1180 gave way and too convincingly, lower levels are poised to come with target at $1165 and then towards the next best support at $1123 #Gold #Investing #Commodities #Trading #Metal
53 2018-08-15 21:59:50 Win Nov canola down A$7.01/t & EU rape down A$1.86. Strong US$ dragged commodities lower. Lower crude oil prices not helping oilseeds. Sth Am soybn area expected to rise pressuring the US mkt.
54 2018-08-15 21:57:16 @RaphaFigueredo td bom? Amigo, gostaria q vc comentasse a respeito do setor de commodities correlacionado com os países emergentes. Pois na composição do EEM, 60% do índice refere-se aos setores de tecnologia e financeiro. As commodities continuam tão relevantes assim?
55 2018-08-15 21:55:55 Lol what? You need to learn about supply and demand, when demand increases, prices increase, when demand decreases (during recessions, layoffs), prices decrease. Workers are commodities so they will follow that trend
56 2018-08-15 21:54:49 Win Nov canola down A$7.01/t & EU rape down A$1.86. Strong US$ dragged commodities lower. Lower crude oil prices not helping oilseeds. Sth Am soybn area expected to rise pressuring the US mkt.
57 2018-08-15 21:51:07 Beef appearing to be topping out. Open-order! Sell Oct. live Cattle at 111.45 & sell Oct. Feeders Cattle at 152.75. Stay long the Yen. Buy Dec. corn at 353 & Nov. Beans at 835. Should be stopped out of gold & on the sidelines. #Agriculture #commodities #Forex #Grains #Beef #farm
58 2018-08-15 21:45:50 Of course they are. So why are you wanting a low tax society that treats people like commodities?
59 2018-08-15 21:29:17 Nothing.  Insurance and healthcare are two different commodities.  A lot of them are young people who make choices to gamble on not needing insurance.
60 2018-08-15 21:23:58 China in March began operating a giant space mission station in Quintuco, Patagonia Argentina. Otherwise mostly railways. Control supply chain of commodities.
61 2018-08-15 21:23:57 Lula surfou na onda das commodities, teve a maior aprovação popular da história, recebeu votos da reaçada que hj apoia bozonaro.
Poderia ter mudado o país.

Mas esqueceu da indústria, acho que a maré boa duraria pra sempre e se abraçou com o CENTRÃO. 
PT age como se fosse santo.
62 2018-08-15 21:21:31 How is this good news. Does it reflect on the price of commodities in the market? You guys just feel like criticism of a govt means antagonism. Let them do well and let it reflect in the life of the common man and see the praises they will get.

64 2018-08-15 21:12:48 Bredda, recentemente participei de um evento na Camara de Comercio Americana (AmCham). Palestrou o Diretor Executivo da CME Group, que deu um overview sobre a visão dele nas commodities em geral, considerando o ritmo de crescimento da economia global. Achei ele meio pessimista.
65 2018-08-15 21:12:00 Qual projeto de país do lulopetismo? Quais as diretrizes do plano de governo? Como deixar de depender de commodities? Como aumentar renda e emprego? Como diminuir a violência urbana? Estão muito preocupados no teatro Lula x STF e esquecem do Brasil
66 2018-08-15 21:10:09 @GeorgeMonbiot Thank you for the obesity article. Dad was ag economist who headed a US presidential commission on "Food and Fiber" (textile fibers) in the late '60s. He said then "Be careful: most food will soon be only an end-product of the commodities market. Plant veggies!"
67 2018-08-15 21:07:54 I always thought slavery was a capitalist idea; people were literal commodities to be bought and sold and profited off of.
68 2018-08-15 21:02:15 Are they going to go buy it in the corner store? No. Commodities are what terrorists seek. Or assisted living equipment.
69 2018-08-15 21:01:51 Al no ver un mercado regulatorio y un soporte económico como en el caso de los commodities, a mi gusto es un gran casino. Siempre que compras una inversión es importante entender que estas comprando, sus oportunidades de crecimiento y sus riesgos.
70 2018-08-15 20:57:45 Commodities despencam nos mercados
71 2018-08-15 20:53:20 Descenso en Wall Street  en el contexto de la reciente crisis  cambiaria de Turquía, una caída de commodities y la incertidumbre  persistente por las tensiones comerciales entre Estados Unidos y sus  socios.
72 2018-08-15 20:51:00 given the way other commodities are trading, #cl_f looks strong.  crazy
73 2018-08-15 20:50:02 I wonder where they get their statistics from. Prices of commodities are still high. I hope it's not about the 2019 election.
74 2018-08-15 20:49:08 STOP treating animals like commoditiesgiven them a chance to a better life Animals R sentient beings capable of feeling emotions n no one can allow all this cruelty Their suffering deserves consideration#AnimalRights
75 2018-08-15 20:39:07 It's a kind of market fundamentalism, a belief that housing and land behave the same way as typical commodities (they never have) and that the market will provide for all if left alone. Fully unregulated capitalism would collapse in 2 weeks, tending as it does to monopolization
76 2018-08-15 20:37:52 They have great business/market indicator pages that you can set going in the background and know what share/currency/bond/commodities markets are doing real time 24/7. Same CNBC ... not everything is political.
77 2018-08-15 20:35:03 #LulaÉCandidato contra o golpe. Contra o Brasil Colônia. Contra o Brasil fascista. Contra o Brasil rentista. Contra o Brasil agrário. Contra o Brasil commodities. Contra o Brasil BB Bala e Bíblia. Contra o Tucanistão.
78 2018-08-15 20:29:54 The corporate definition of love is obsessed with commodities, property, and hoarding of things and experiences.
79 2018-08-15 20:29:11 Dólar está muito forte... USD e Commodities costumam ter correlação negativa, principalmente ouro, prata e platina.
80 2018-08-15 20:28:56 Importante que países de #Latam monitoreen precios de commodities.
Con dólar fuerte y algo de desaceleración del PBI impactará en cuentas públicas.

No one is willing to fight for what's right.
Courage and integrity are not and should not be commodities for purchase.
82 2018-08-15 20:23:32 No, it should not. Adoption is literally exploiting a woman for her functioning reproductive system, and turns babies into commodities
83 2018-08-15 20:17:34 So, with the statistics, has it reflected in the prices of commodities?! We need such decline in inflation to reflect, down to the common man. Thanks
84 2018-08-15 20:12:52 Inflation dropping yet prices of major  commodities remain the same or higher.
Whush kinda statistical data is this?
Are NIgerians not mad Laidis? 
85 2018-08-15 20:11:05 It is declared to be the policy of Congress, as a measure of national security, to safeguard the health and well-being of the Nation’s children and to encourage the domestic consumption of nutritious agricultural commodities and other food

87 2018-08-15 20:08:47 #US stocks headed for their worst day in almost 2 months, adding to a broad decline in global #equities, as technology shares were roiled by disappointing earnings from Chinese internet giant #Tencent Holdings Ltd. and #copper sank into a bear market, weighing on #commodities!

89 2018-08-15 20:07:41 The "concentrated spectacle," which Debord attributes to totalitarian and  “Stalinist” regimes, is implemented through the cult of personality and the use of force. 

The "diffuse spectacle," which relies on a rich abundance of commodities, is typified by wealthy democracies.
90 2018-08-15 20:07:39 I agree with this Harare is horrible potholes erratic power supply no running water congested CBD dirty water poor street lighting expensive basic commodities the list is endless only positives are hospitable people and peaceful in general
91 2018-08-15 20:05:25 We wake up everyday to something getting crushed - Lira, China, commodities - and our market still finds a way to remain mostly unaffected.

Tactically had closed half my VIX shorts. But US market still won’t give in.
92 2018-08-15 20:05:04 3265: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
93 2018-08-15 20:02:32 Lo he visto esta tarde. Creo que la inflacion ya esta aqui. Y esta para quedarse. Ahora bien, en los mercados todo son probabilidades al final, y no cabe duda que dicha probabilidad es menor ahora dado el panorama de guerra comercial, caida de los commodities, subida del dolar...
94 2018-08-15 20:01:22 #Commodities if is going down that means dollar getting stronger and China getting richer because of deficit.
95 2018-08-15 19:57:48 As we see EM struggle, commodities suffering, political instability, a tight bond market and high stock market expectations, it's a time of caution in the near term, not risk taking.
96 2018-08-15 19:57:19 You want to talk about absurdity, imagine that pot stocks did well on such a horrible day. When I see something that ridiculous, I know the end is near. Basic human needs like commodities are unprofitable to produce, but weed is what everyone is banking the future on. So stupid.
97 2018-08-15 19:55:32 Thanks.  China has been able to run this playbook b/c the US sees the *value* as USD's, while China sees the *value* as the commodities that those USD's buy.

102 2018-08-15 19:44:34 Not sure I agree - but with commodities falling & China getting a wake up call - might be much worse to come

104 2018-08-15 19:41:19 Also: on the highly speculative 'cheap-side' of the metals/commodities punk market: I believe @BanyanGold (#yukon) and two other small explorers (in Yukon, Ghana) deserve a look today -- subscribers TCR/The Calandra Report

112 2018-08-15 19:03:52 @JoelOsteen is running one of the best long cons in history. We need to implement laws similar to Australia regarding tax exemptions.  Mega churches mega rich “pastors” and board members enriching themselves while parishioners are in the commodities line is an abomination.
113 2018-08-15 19:02:14 What's nice is they are just on the edge of calling people commodities. Something to be valued and traded like on the stock market.
114 2018-08-15 19:00:31 Your personality and interests are commodities in the world we live in, because everything is a commodity in the world we live in, and it's just so amusing how you can turn your self into a commodity valued higher than other selves by branding said self.
115 2018-08-15 18:54:19 I hope that transfers to the ag commodities market soon...there's going to be a lot of pain soon if prices don't rise.

117 2018-08-15 18:44:02 Yes.  China been busy offloading USD's for commodities b/c US entitlement obligations alone are ~70 years of 100% of global oil supplies at 100m b/d & $60/bbl, & oil is by far the biggest commodity mkt.
118 2018-08-15 18:42:18 If the team wins a cup without a single American on the roster, I’d still be happy. But given the limited financial constraints of MLS, they have to leverage all their assets to succeed.

Domestic players also serve as valuable commodities to trade or sell within MLS.

128 2018-08-15 18:19:46 Wow @QueerEye’s @jvn cautioning us that going “too left” means we can’t win despite all the progressive primary wins recently to prove otherwise. Can’t expect more from a show that thinks you can effect change through selling commodities rather than organizing.

137 2018-08-15 18:04:31 It's the #TradeWars triggering this #stockmarket rotational trading, not Turkey's woes.

138 2018-08-15 18:03:10 Many countries have buffet stocks for commodities, Brazil had this for coffee, marketing boards in Africa, etc. it’s not sufficient to stabilize the price level
139 2018-08-15 18:02:24 Gvts actually used to have buffer stocks for key commodities to stabilize their price. JG is similar in that sense.

159 2018-08-15 17:22:08 It depends on how you see performance.
For me its in terms of job created/job loss, prices of goods and commodities, the strenght/weakness of our currency, security/lack of it; these are the things that affect d common man directly and PMB scores lower in all these.
160 2018-08-15 17:18:03 I thought it was a tough decision so I expected something close to a 50/50 split. Both were acts of clear inhumanity but tbh slaves lived something closer to actual lives. Some were elevated, they had children, they were treated as commodities which is of more value than

188 2018-08-15 16:23:46 It has been established in many categories that are 'quasi' commodities like packaged tea for new brand triers of  undifferentiated brands. Focusing on key attributes leads to equity movements and is usually followed by sales/share increase.

192 2018-08-15 16:04:17 Comic book characters by Marvel or DC are commodities. As long as they are profitable they will not be allowed to die. Readers will never experience the end of the story; just a neverending series of climaxes.
193 2018-08-15 16:03:25 @Iamsamirarora sir is strengthening of dollar not good for us as it keeps rising crude and other commodities in check. As well rates are kept in check. In recent times dollar has been acting like an offensive as well defensive currency. Offensive due to its growth.

195 2018-08-15 15:59:49 years of the Western world bombing, raping, pillaging third world countries are finally coming home to roost.

196 2018-08-15 15:59:45 I'm all for Freedom of Movement providing it's 'of People' and not just 'of Labour' - the latter reduces human beings to commodities on the same level of as Goods, Services and Capital.

204 2018-08-15 15:39:10 If you’re actively trading (which could be profitable if you’re really good given the volatility), do you really have another choice? Traders of other commodities do this all the time if I’m not mistaken...

219 2018-08-15 15:24:39 also, the market is never free, it's (and it was, and it will be) always "relatively free."

the market sustains itself by allowing free circulation of commodities and disallowing free circulation of labour. so there is cheap labour and commodities are sold with larger profit.

222 2018-08-15 15:20:39 "Opinions" are the cheapest commodities on earth. Everyone has a flock of opinions ready to be wished upon anyone who will accept them.
223 2018-08-15 15:20:26 Global markets have only succeeded in increasing corporate wealth and have raised prices for average Americans. Increased demand for our farm commodities raises shelf prices.
224 2018-08-15 15:17:49 Dodged a bullet on that copper stock.  Saved myself two days of serious pain.  This USD rally and the thrashing commodities are taking is going to punch some holes in some stuff. Kinda glad I'm 80% cash at the moment.

226 2018-08-15 15:16:18 We don't need pictures or " Barchat" to show economy picking up...if truly economy is picking up, it will reflect in the price of commodities, not on twitter.

We buy fuel for 145/litre, Bag of rice for 14000 which is against the 7000k ...pls tell me how the economy is picking up
227 2018-08-15 15:16:11 Totally agree, growth is already showing signs of deceleration. Commodities are getting slaughtered,  "Mack the Knife" (King Dollar + positive real US interest rates) is taking gold to the woodshed (Gibson paradox). Cash might be king right now but in US dollars.
228 2018-08-15 15:15:30 "Anti-livestock"? Yes, we are against treating "living-things" as commodities. We don't oppose the return of Pen Herd cows, we oppose their return to sexual manipulation until slaughter as rehabilitation through "animal therapy." Unnecessary. Counterproductive. SANCTUARY instead.
229 2018-08-15 15:11:30 This one is a cluster f@ck for the ages... Central Bank right on que to destroy global markets with $ tightening. Crypto gone, Commodities gone, EM equities gone, EM credit gone all in meltdown... US Equities and HY have been remarkably resilient. Maybe the US economy is strong
230 2018-08-15 15:09:53 commodities and currencies are inversely correlated to the dollar. Plus dollar shortage is causing short squeeze. Dollar strength usually means commodity weakness. U308 with political support, geo politcal events and supply demand fund should buck the trend
231 2018-08-15 15:07:59 Yes, but he has failed to deliver on his magical promises for the mining industry, and his trade war is absolutely killing farmers. While most are watching polls and tweets, I’m watching commodities prices.  Corn, soybeans, hogs - all well below break-even.  Bankruptcies coming.
232 2018-08-15 15:02:21 This is probably pushing the metaphor beyond its capabilities. The point of the initial tweet was simply to point out that rights are not commodities. If you are given the right to free speech, that does not mean that there are no more free speech rights to be granted to others.

244 2018-08-15 14:41:51 The expected market dip I had between August and November I feel is happening. This is a dip I will buy once we get 5/8% corrections in main indices . Took off some profits today as I feel I will buy cheaper soon #Trading #equities & #commodities

249 2018-08-15 14:33:48 The so called grabbing of public lands and construction at illegal areas has been further entertained by state agencies. e.g.  @KenyaPower @kenyawater these agencies should develop a policy of supplying these commodities only on areas that have not been encroached.@NemaKenya

255 2018-08-15 14:27:31 This is the $DXY ramp I’ve been talking about for 2 weeks. I’ve wanted this to send PSI bearish so we can get a nice setup long for commodities when it level sets back down

267 2018-08-15 13:42:55 Here we go again with comparing us to populations who come from homogeneous cultures, weren't subject to a forced mass migration and weren't treated as commodities and shackled into 2 centuries of free labor and subsequently several decades of institutional discrimination
268 2018-08-15 13:39:47 All true. The question I have is if there are risks to treating providers as commodities of equal quality. I am not pre judging this network exclusion, I think we lack adequate granular data to assess. But in general terms there is no question there are large quality variations.
269 2018-08-15 13:37:57 Deflate relative to what? If it's an inflating national currency, I think that's precisely what Hayek wants (something which has a stable value relative to *commodities*)

275 2018-08-15 13:29:10 Sentiment with commodities is very bad this morning.
276 2018-08-15 13:21:34 Not 'always' and not on a 'net' basis. When investment in commodities as an asset class took off in the mid 00's, there was an increase in Gross longs, but there is nothing to stop gross shorts overcoming this position. That's happening now, I think. 1/2

278 2018-08-15 13:17:49 The #dollar resumed its rise on Wednesday, surging to new 13-month highs and upping pressure on commodities, emerging markets and global stocks, though the Turkish lira managed out to eke out a second day of gains.
279 2018-08-15 13:14:52 Chile’s economy kept expanding throughout the commodities slowdown. We have Haitians and Venezuelans cleaning toilets, serving fast food and looking after kids. There are fewer Peruvian in menial jobs now because of their own copper boom. You do wonder what all that is built on.

283 2018-08-15 13:03:42 The fetishism for Scholastic book fairs is the end product of a corporate campaign to portray books as desirable commodities, and direct ownership as the only means of accessing authentic experience, thereby alienating poor students. This ain't a TEDTalk.

285 2018-08-15 12:58:51 I agree for loans taken in CNY/CNH and issued in China, these can be ultimately socialised to hide the losses. The real issue is the USD debt that is collateralised with commodities that are priced in USD. The loan needs to be repaid in USD and there in lies the problem...

D prices of commodities are still doubled. If inflation dropped from above 18% to 11.14% does it not affect prices?
Is it a real time inflation figure or politically influenced for 2019?

318 2018-08-15 11:31:16 Some foolish Capitalist Running Dogs and their Social Democrat Assistant believe that there must be Exchange of Commodities, no matter where and when, Obviously that's stupid. Socialism will abolish Commodities step by step, by transforming commodities into Pure Product.

323 2018-08-15 11:16:30 Good business is mostly about turn-over and high demands, and to be very successful, You have to always find a way to drive traffic to your commodities, by providing the "The People" what they want. Remember, more 'People' more Money.
324 2018-08-15 11:12:27 was waiting at 44.50 for a fill to short but never got there.. this aligns with the washout in metals today.. stocks about to drop and commodities bounce.
325 2018-08-15 11:10:34 this is about bretton woods, and the resulting treaties and institutions. the principle of commodities and trade based on USD. so every country works against the Cassa, except the United States.

327 2018-08-15 11:09:43 Keep a close eye on commodities over the next few weeks. This will be a very good indicator of whether the global economy has any legs left. For all the machinations about #gold, copper is a much bigger deal for global demand and also highly levered collateral in #china.

341 2018-08-15 10:13:33 Sir you are right, but our president know we get excited when we see development projects, we forget oil prices, we forget basic commodities prices....
342 2018-08-15 10:07:09 I know...Everything that has the word commodities is getting sold aggressively (silver, platinum, copper etc).
343 2018-08-15 09:53:05 2) As the dollar rises, those commodities will decline unless there is a real shortage in supply that dips below demand.
344 2018-08-15 09:52:36 1) Investors are betting on an economic boom in the U.S. and rising U.S. interest rates that will attract even more capital to the dollar. This also weighs very heavily on emerging market currencies and commodities prices expressed in dollars.
345 2018-08-15 09:52:22 "optimal basket of commodities used to measure and manage stability" 

There can be no monetary stability
346 2018-08-15 09:48:40 I am Brazilian and I couldn't agree more. It's a shame that my country only exports commodities.
347 2018-08-15 09:48:34 enquanto o projeto do Bolsonaro confunde bem de consumo com propriedade privada, o projeto do Daciolo defende a reestatização do que foi provatizado, a industrialização, a soberania do Brasil sobre os commodities tanto em exportação quanto na utilização real de matérias primas 
348 2018-08-15 09:42:59 Funny, it's been a key measure in how I look at #gold. As we keep in mind #commodities are broadly down to 4-5 month lows. Good call, Tony.

363 2018-08-15 09:00:34 Interesting? Privatised industry free market for the privateers but not for the workers.  Treat us like commodities but opportunity cost  not applicable. Why don’t you look at executive pay over the period perks share options and golden hellos and goodbyes then criticise?

468 2018-08-15 02:15:36 Crypto was a liquidity play on central bank balance sheet. That’s why it had such a strong surge from 2013 (QE kicked into full gear) until QT this year. Crypto was the most sensitive to liquidity, next is Emerging Markets (currently happening), commodities, then HY, stocks
469 2018-08-15 02:10:59 I understand. Gas cost is a part of Transportation cost and oil cost is a part of commodity cost both shown in the graph.

476 2018-08-15 01:53:02 No, I didn’t get s bump in pay. My stocks dropped s bit, and let’s not discuss my commodities. It really doesn’t matter who is in the WH, I will always make money. What I don’t like is the hypocritical rhetoric and explicit bias that you and your fellow Trump people bathe in.

478 2018-08-15 01:51:52 Freedom is one of the most expensive commodities. No amount of money will be enough to buy freedom.

483 2018-08-15 01:30:21 No question there. When I came in to the business in 2006 my father, who started selling insurance in 1980, told me product sales were going to be commodities soon. Insisted I meet with an early CFP he was friends with. Really good advice.

485 2018-08-15 01:19:48 People who think like you are indeed rare commodities. Thank goodness for that or our Country would be a train wreck. Not going to disrespect the hard work of our ancestors by putting up with your nonsense and taking everything we have for granted
486 2018-08-15 01:09:31 Idk how the inflation rate is calculated but for common man the basic necessities are still on the costlier side
E.g vegetables
Despite of global fall in oil prices Modi govt hasn't reduced the price which impacts the transportation & eventually impacts the price of commodities
487 2018-08-15 01:07:15 Interesting read.   Provides another slant on China and may explain broader weakness in commodities, however this is not really showing up in other markets. So I don't know what to conclude.
488 2018-08-15 01:02:54 It’s oscillating price is set by supply & demand but it’s underlying value is established by the exertion of energy. If its value as system for recording transactions ends up being far less than energy expended to create it, it’ll collapse as w/ so many other commodities.

490 2018-08-15 00:58:40 People as commodities. That sounds like a socialist.
491 2018-08-15 00:56:57 You're calling it Comex for commodities.  I see Nynex when I google. Talked to a friend Currency Futures Trader who told me he was shorting the Euro because something big is at play in the global currencies, setting up the USD to gain.  I asked what, he said highlevl manipulation

496 2018-08-15 00:31:16 Imagine a world w/out US $$ as world currency? 

Chaos. Only commodities would hold value, labor would be worth a lot less--arbitrage on steroids.

Goodbye US middle class--forever.
497 2018-08-15 00:30:10 .@SecretaryZinke’s suggestions are crap.

Our #wildlife & wild lands are not commodities to be sold off to the highest bidder.

He, @SecretarySonny & @DOIDepSec are not welcome in #California.

498 2018-08-15 00:16:30 Y los tres mas importantes, que no recuperamos más:
- Tiempo
- La mejor oportunidad con los mejores precios de commodities en un siglo
- La educación de una generación entera.
499 2018-08-15 00:14:23 2/ My beef with the deal: Jimenez was insanely valuable. Top-10 overall prospects a year out from the Majors (he'd be in the Majors already if he wasn't in a rebuilding organization) are among the single most valuable commodities in the game and with obvious reason.
