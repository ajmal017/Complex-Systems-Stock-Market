I hope you enjoy experimenting with oils though. I used to use acrylics exclusively, but it was love at first sight when I tried oil paints. The blending of colors is amazing.

7 2018-04-19 23:57:44 This is correct, we do in fact need a PROVINCIAL SALES TAX!  Just like every other province so we can stop basing decisions on oil prices.

41 2018-04-19 23:54:49 A pea-sized amount of baby oil can act as a shine hair serum before dashing out the door.
42 2018-04-19 23:54:48 New Brunswick has Canada's largest oil refinery and most of their oil comes from Saudi Arabia produce gasoline which is mostly exported but also used in Canada.
43 2018-04-19 23:54:36 Oil is 100% organic.
44 2018-04-19 23:54:28 I know I don’t matter in your CANADA Catherine. I’m white, male and I work in oil and gas. You’d probably like for me to disappear. I will not, I will fight against you and your communist ideology. You and your entitled boss are destroying this once great nation.#TrudeauMustGo

47 2018-04-19 23:54:13 If Sri Lanka had oil or something "valuable" for western countries, maybe the world would have paid attention to the hundreds of thousands of Tamil people being murdered.
48 2018-04-19 23:54:11 Newfoundland produces 70 million barrels of oil per year most of it is refined in the United States and Europe.
49 2018-04-19 23:54:08 I got 2 questions for the TL cooks:
1. Do u wash your rice before cooking it?
2. Do u oil your rice before or as it cooks?
50 2018-04-19 23:54:07 Yeah, it’s not THAT big. Source:I’ve seen oil drums in person and measured them
51 2018-04-19 23:53:57 @italksec crap I have synthetic oil!
52 2018-04-19 23:53:50 Looks like a buying opportunity.....  Bonds tracking oil.
53 2018-04-19 23:53:49 Bitumen shipped by rail isn't dangerous.  It's different from the light crude that comes from the Bakken oil fields in North Dakota which is very volatile.  Problem with bitumen is that it sinks so cleanup almost impossible.
54 2018-04-19 23:53:39 I think it's the palo seco oil power plant.
55 2018-04-19 23:53:02 The amusing thing is I’m simultaneously debating a climate change denier.

That’s Because Scientists don’t let political ideology over rule evidence.

There’s lots of things that can go wrong in oil and gas. But practically none of them are due to hydraulic fracture stimulation.
56 2018-04-19 23:52:59 somebody knowledgeable about cbd oil hit my dm’s
57 2018-04-19 23:52:52 Since starting the cbd oil a month ago, I can see my age spots or dark freckles getting lighter and lighter.  Yay!
58 2018-04-19 23:52:51 It’s still gonna happen, face reality! The oil is gonna get sucked out of Alberta and sold to the world!
59 2018-04-19 23:52:44 I'm told by some of the best geologists in Australia that NT could have enough gas to destroy Australia for almost 200 years. There could be oil too which would help our national security. It is hard to get a geologist excited but they are excited about this!
60 2018-04-19 23:52:23 What @tmod__ said coconut oil is wonderful. Also using good branded colourlock and intensifying conditioners.

67 2018-04-19 23:51:04 Great point - and Lucas Oil is another one of "those" stadiums I'd like to go to
68 2018-04-19 23:51:00 Is the oil price *higher* when it's $60 a barrel and the £/US$ is $1.20 to £1.00 or when the price is $70 a barrel and the £/$US rate is $1.42 to £1.00?
69 2018-04-19 23:50:58 Obviously they need 3 times the oil.
70 2018-04-19 23:50:47 Oil prices don't affect my pay.  Me working my balls off does. 

And I have worked my balls off!
71 2018-04-19 23:50:15 Thad’s the best part. In a stunning reversal, Alberta Cons want the feds to assert MORE control over the provinces. And establish a national energy program that forced oil companies to buy expensive domestic oil. Interesting stance from the Alberta firewall/free market crowd.
72 2018-04-19 23:50:13 He’s gonna be too shy to show his face in prison, because people are gonna be wanting to check his oil. (If he is even indicted)
73 2018-04-19 23:50:09 As opposed to larger carbon footprint manufacturing combustion engines and drilling for oil?
74 2018-04-19 23:50:01 Russia's economy is oil!

79 2018-04-19 23:49:20 Because the Globalist want to build a pipeline into Western Europe constituting of Natural Gas and Oil all apart destroying the economic vitality of Russia as Europe gets its gas from Russia. Russia is the largest oil producer besides US.
80 2018-04-19 23:48:18 Haha shut up. Looks like BP did another oil spill on your face.
81 2018-04-19 23:48:09 Big oil with the help of government will chip away at this planet until there is nothing left.

83 2018-04-19 23:47:56 After imposing a moratorium on oil drilling in Alaska, I seem to remember something about Obama providing a $$$ multi-billions sweetheart deal (courtesy of US taxpayers) to PETROBRAS, a Brazilian drilling Co, who counts Soros as its biggest investor.
84 2018-04-19 23:47:55 Lilac oil burning as well as beeswax candles makes for the best fae springtime awesomeness scent mixture ever. If I can’t have spring outside it can at least smell like it inside!

93 2018-04-19 23:47:01 Mustard oil is not good for our health. Please guy's mustard oil avoid. And olive oil used continue to our food. Because mustard oil found has 14% fat which % has 2% (saturated fat) Saturated fat means bad fat and found in colestrol. Which increases to hour heart attack.take care

97 2018-04-19 23:46:29 Try toothpaste (not the gel version) or olive oil
98 2018-04-19 23:46:27 Marsden Point does use approx 3% NZ oil

NZ oil is a higher quality & we import a cheaper oil to convert to various fuels

Its my understanding the @NZGreens stopped Marsden Point being upgraded to process local oil

114 2018-04-19 23:45:14 It would be nice for them to start a business, now Novichok aside. There is [nearly, coconut only IMO] no match for olive oil. Sesame [love it] is delicious but U can use ionly for enhancing the taste, being too strong. Canola doesn't taste.

125 2018-04-19 23:44:41 both the united kingdom and france are also absurdly wrong and supporting absurd attacks and violence in order to get oil. they’re known for that as well. but you’re not trying to actually have a fair conversation, you just want to be on a high horse. an easy read indeed.

129 2018-04-19 23:44:23 And where do you people dig up all the lies that you spew. We cpild shut down the oil industry in canada and it wouldnt change shot in the world. Why arent you people in the countrys that are the big polluters and miht make a differene. You would all be locked up if you did.

144 2018-04-19 23:42:39 we have #top #medical #marijuana strains , #wax, #cannabis seeds, #oil, pills good for chronic diseases and other associated situations like cancer and we do delivery within USA and all over Europe if interested, hit us for the menu.  (740) 560-0496

147 2018-04-19 23:42:24 It took 40 years to finally beat Big Tobacco in the Courts.
In 2058, governments will recoup some of the health care costs.
Someone should 'Court Order' the Oil Companies to stop shredding their research reports and memos.

153 2018-04-19 23:41:13 My blackberry seed oil finally came in and I’m so excited to see how it works for my skin.
154 2018-04-19 23:41:12 That’s so awesome
155 2018-04-19 23:41:11 No-one in their right mind could truthfully describe James Callaghan, Denis Healey, Merlyn Rees and David Owen as 'hard left'.    
    
The country was bankrupt when Labour took over in 1974, thanks to the Heath administration. The huge rise in oil prices then killed it off.
156 2018-04-19 23:41:07 All you LAZY Nigerian youths, just get out of my sight & out of Nigeria.The oil is NOT for you. It's for the geroncrats.The Generals. The Traditonal rulers. Go & work in Libya or Afghanistan or Iraq. Shikena. Kabisa. Siagware

Oh wait there's no oil

168 2018-04-19 23:39:34 I get them and my eyelashes don't get fucked up! I saw this tweet I had to say something lol, just make sure that when your going to take them off, don't yank them off! Put olive oil or coconut oil on them for a while and they slide right off

176 2018-04-19 23:38:43 Love ya, McQuaid, but you need to understand that the reversal pass behind the net to Chara -- when he's already established forward momentum -- is unwise. It takes longer for him to change direction than a fully loaded oil tanker in open seas.

177 2018-04-19 23:38:27 He wasn't referring to pple like u. Read again: "a lot of them haven't been 2 schl & they r claiming that Nigeria has been an oil producing country therefore they should sit & do nothing & get housing, healthcare, education free"
U went to sch right?
178 2018-04-19 23:38:24 i just grabbed some from whole foods and it said cooked in oil...but it never specified as to which oil #. 
179 2018-04-19 23:38:09 It’s only been a couple of days but @mydrunkelephant Facial Oil and Whipped Cream have changed my life 
180 2018-04-19 23:38:09 And fries aren’t vegan because any place that makes French fries cooks them in the same oil as meat so a true vegan can’t eat it. Same goes for falafel or spring rolls. Pasta and Oreos are exceptions to this nonsense diet.
181 2018-04-19 23:38:05 Wow I can't believe you got an oil change. That's something only rich people can do.
182 2018-04-19 23:37:55 He has that chilled olive oil in his veins.
183 2018-04-19 23:37:06 Yes that's the best policy for lean mass gaining.

Further to that, even drop protein a little from how high it was when cutting, drive
polyunsaturated fat (olive oil, oily fish like salmon/trout/mackerel) up a bit, plus put monounsaturated fat up a little (avocado, macadamias).
184 2018-04-19 23:36:59 The one about rubbing holy oil on Stephs ankle to heal it killed me! 
185 2018-04-19 23:36:50 the deadliest slip and slide has been created with over 50 bottles of dish wash and oil which will be the battleground for today's match
186 2018-04-19 23:36:31 Hey @bathbodyworks I've thought of a compromise. I understand how much work getting a product back to market can be. So, how about you just sell me a 55 gallon drum of Bergamot wall flower oil? 

No need to worry about nationwide logistics. Just a single barrel shipped to me. 
187 2018-04-19 23:36:26 Release Biafrans and their oil so we can see who is lazy.
188 2018-04-19 23:36:10 I'll need to oil up my walker, but I will be there!!!
189 2018-04-19 23:36:10 Him: well how do people get to the anti-oil protest, huh? Was it maybe using cars that run on gasoline??

Me: well what did you eat for breakfast? Was it maybe some form of solar-powered carbohydrate?? And yet you claim to support oil. Hypocrite.
190 2018-04-19 23:35:49 yes, and mct oil, but still black at times #bulletproof

194 2018-04-19 23:35:06 Except when looked at long term no offshore oil and gas exploration will help reduce emissions.
195 2018-04-19 23:35:00 It would have been a nice brand name for an expensive oil, now it's too late, say olive [delicious!] or sesame [Indian and CN cuisine] or coconut [expensive even in IDN, #1 w/ pasta olio-aglio-peperoncino ]. IR has olive groves, does RU, Caucasus, have a chance for olive trees?
196 2018-04-19 23:35:00 Idk what kinda oil to buy or anything  my car has said 0% oil for at least a month LMAO

199 2018-04-19 23:34:10 Tories said N Sea oil running out. Now Colin Clark, Conservative MP for Gordon, said: “This investment by a global leader... committing to a further 20 years in Aberdeenshire sends a clear signal that there is plenty of life left in the North Sea.”
200 2018-04-19 23:34:07 Light flavored oil like canola, grape seed, or avocado.
201 2018-04-19 23:34:00 Y’all are still using lights? In 2018?

Nah man

Use the classic oil lamp
202 2018-04-19 23:33:56 @freshfmibadan Nigerian youths are indeed lazy. All they do is ride expensive power bikes, get injured, and get flown abroad by their parents with Nigerian free oil money."
203 2018-04-19 23:33:43 Argon oil changed my life.  I can now see the light.
204 2018-04-19 23:33:29 We need more homes with solar to off set the big polluter for energy... wait NG is clean burn aahh and so is coal (English Tech) Now nuke plants need to be shutdown along with oil based. Just a thought to look into....
205 2018-04-19 23:33:24 I think I will really like it!
206 2018-04-19 23:33:09 What happened to jingles?
207 2018-04-19 23:33:00 If I take the perspective of a US citizen, buying cheap Canadian oil so I can build an extraordinarily powerful country appeals to me. That makes my financial flight from Canada feel better.
208 2018-04-19 23:32:38 I went there to see Bastille last year! It was cold and slushy but it looked like a beautiful city
209 2018-04-19 23:32:29 You get some CBD oil or something?
210 2018-04-19 23:32:23 I think it's gone up everywhere. Might be due to Syria bombing. Any time there's something going on in the Middle East oil prices go up.
211 2018-04-19 23:32:21 Nuts, seeds, vegetable oil and supplements in some cases.
212 2018-04-19 23:32:18 Also, still trying to figure out why "fusion" is your only answer here. So it's coal, oil, "fusion," or nothing? Why? Because that's what the coal and oil industries told you to think?
213 2018-04-19 23:32:14 Just dump a load of oil in it then, it'll be fine.
214 2018-04-19 23:32:07 Diamonds are not rare, they're just hoarded by one company. Oil is hoarded by many competing, in theory, companies.
215 2018-04-19 23:31:57 BINGO!

218 2018-04-19 23:31:32 Plenty of oil in the Americas. Probably cheaper to invade Venezuela.
219 2018-04-19 23:31:31 Not as obesogenic as you might think: all those foods were cooked with lard and butter, nary a vegetable oil to poison them.
220 2018-04-19 23:31:09 So everybody outta oil huh?
221 2018-04-19 23:31:08 can’t, not enough oil revenue

223 2018-04-19 23:30:50 Good to clarify because the cartoon specifically refers to oil & gas. I believe some vehicles run on gas as well though? Not sure numbers/proportion in NZ.
224 2018-04-19 23:30:43 Yes, because it’s Britain’s oil.

233 2018-04-19 23:29:46 But all our wars have been illegal per our Constitution. He was charged with war crimes because of torture.
 Even Afghanistan had more freedom for women prior to the US invasion. 
If you provide your proof,  I'll provide mine.
These are wars simply for oil and oil pipelines.
234 2018-04-19 23:29:43 i should’ve went to get a oil change like my dad told me to do days ago 
235 2018-04-19 23:29:41 TO REMOVE WHITE SPOTS FROM FURNITURE, rub first with oil, and its relation to the Tribe.
236 2018-04-19 23:29:39 @CBCCanada @CTVNews @globalnews @globeandmail @ElizabethMay  
Fair oil prices will take place when we start boycotting foreign owned companies - husky (China) shell (dutch) esso & chevron ((USA) . They dominate the market, buy Canadian, Fas Gas , Co-op, RCSS ,local independents
237 2018-04-19 23:29:33 That’s a sorry state of affairs. If nothing came out when you took out the plug and he’s not changed the oil since it was serviced (and why would he?) then it sounds like there wasn’t much to begin with.
238 2018-04-19 23:29:32 If you don’t mind me asking; where in Canada are you going?
239 2018-04-19 23:29:29 Boy, I say Boy (L.Graham)...you got more convoluted answers than a Circuit, Carnival Barker/Snake Oil Salesman.  GO Home.
240 2018-04-19 23:29:28 “When the devil caresses you, he wants your soul”  
Analysts expect Epidiolex to cost $2,500 to $5,000 .... a 10 ml flask of hemp oil costs $ 25.
241 2018-04-19 23:29:17 But them dey they the same container. You go still know say oil dey the water
242 2018-04-19 23:29:17 So what? Oil companies have massive expensive to set against tax, and tax rates on oil companies were slashed, at Swinney’s request. Tax revenue on oil is negligible and will be in the foreseeable future.

248 2018-04-19 23:28:49 The decline of foreign investment is owing mainly to withdrawal of foreign money from the Alberta oil patch caused by low oil prices. The current gov't doesn't dictate world oil price. There is a glut in the global oil markets caused in part by the global transition to renewables
249 2018-04-19 23:28:45 Is Gartman long oil yet? Asking for a friend.

255 2018-04-19 23:28:04 Rex Tillerson, Trump's first secretary of state, was an oil company executive. His dream was to use the State Department to open up more areas of the Earth for dirty technology. He just doesn't care about the environment at all.

264 2018-04-19 23:27:07 There goes the gas prices, going to jump up 50+ cents because of Texas and their no regulations on oil and gas refineries!!!
265 2018-04-19 23:27:04 It doesn’t matter, it’s still British oil.
266 2018-04-19 23:26:47 No one gets to tell God what he should accept from those observing the Sabbath. God required a burnt offering, “two bulls…, one ram, seven male lambs a year old without blemish; and two tenths of an ephah of fine flour for a grain offering, mixed with oil,” and a drink offering.

278 2018-04-19 23:24:38 For example, very few free speech absolutists are entirely opposed to libel laws, to laws prohibiting people from advertising the unproven medical claims of their snake oil, or from laws against fraud.
279 2018-04-19 23:24:34 Me and online conversations = oil and water. We nah mix
280 2018-04-19 23:24:31 I guess it depends on the location, and how long it's been since they changed their oil.

291 2018-04-19 23:22:33 Stop fighting each other so we don't have to go over there. 70% of the world's oil reserves are in the middle east of course we need to keep the area stable.
292 2018-04-19 23:22:30 Where the oil?
293 2018-04-19 23:22:08 Coconut Body Butter from our 
Essential Oil Free Collection
294 2018-04-19 23:21:50 That foot needs some oil ASAP
295 2018-04-19 23:21:42 Since the vultures in the National Assembly, the Labour union, and “our oil boys” will not allow the old refineries to be operated by private organisations, the government change her focus to dangote .
296 2018-04-19 23:21:31 First off tell them hopefully they have an entitled life and can live off their name sake. And know how to become a forked tounge snake oil salesmen
297 2018-04-19 23:21:01 Ah, so this is why oil/gasoline prices have been rising...days before this happened.
298 2018-04-19 23:20:57 Changed my own oil And switched out my battery , saved paying for labor when I’m well enough to do it on my own.
299 2018-04-19 23:20:51 Can't we just get something straight? The president only said a lot of Nigeria youths are taking advantage of the fact that Nigeria is an oil producing state and thereby doing nothing to improve their own lives....a lot he said,  not all. FFK and his think-alikes keep fooling us!

302 2018-04-19 23:20:32 She was sleeping under a table with her younger sister when a large pan of burning hot oil tilted over and the oil poured on them. That's what happened 
303 2018-04-19 23:20:29 Quick, oil them shredders!
304 2018-04-19 23:20:24 @BNN Please do a study or story on how Canada's lack of oil export to world markets has impact on my long term retirement.  Affect on TSX? Affect on future higher taxes because of lower royalties, corp and income taxes? Should we move all our investments out of Canada?
305 2018-04-19 23:20:15 My dad is not home and he promised me he will changed my oil and lights and he’s not here yet ! Looks like I have to do it myself!
306 2018-04-19 23:20:15 Self care has looked like rub downs with coconut oil and my aromatherapy essential oils
307 2018-04-19 23:20:04 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic
308 2018-04-19 23:20:00 I’ve never gotten them done personally though. Try using castor oil at night! I use it on my eyebrows and lashes!
309 2018-04-19 23:19:52 I have cut back to one 12ounce coffee per day since it’s fat fueled, I do 12oz coffee, 2 tablespoons grass fed butter, 1 tablespoon MCT oil, one scoop MCT powder ,1/2 cup cashew milk and one tablespoon of heavy cream 
310 2018-04-19 23:19:44 It will be intriguing to see how you drive your broomsticks to work (if you do work), move goods around BC and build all those new houses with no gas, oil, or money.

317 2018-04-19 23:18:24 In CCCP sunflower oil greases you.
318 2018-04-19 23:18:22 Charles will only believe it when he hear LAZY YOUTHS from Buhari.  He probably didn't understand the direct translation of 60% being below 30, seating and doing nothing because they produce oil.
319 2018-04-19 23:18:08 The irony is that sunflower oil IS poison !
320 2018-04-19 23:18:03 update: getting an oil change isn’t that hard i just have anxiety
321 2018-04-19 23:18:03 Don't judge yourself or others. What was once crude oil is now high octane fuel. All it needs is a little refinement.

329 2018-04-19 23:17:36 It’s cute. Those hard hats are made from oil, their shoes, those stickers.. I could go on and on. They just supported the cause they’re fighting by paying for that stuff. Idiots.
330 2018-04-19 23:17:35 NO BABY OIL

331 2018-04-19 23:17:30 well you did put oil on your face
332 2018-04-19 23:17:09 It shouldn't be forgotten how much North Sea Oil saved Britain's economy & it should be stressed that with the days of Oil dominance numbered, we are not working hard enough on developing things that can replace it's cash flow. Tax cuts for a new car factory won't cut it.

335 2018-04-19 23:16:49 They have always been like this regardless of what type of president was in power in Iran.The Islamic Republic has been and always will be the savage beast it is and the likes of you will always be there to sell the people and the country to oil money and lobby for these crooks.
336 2018-04-19 23:16:30 Oh!!!  Mr Charles, you want it to be spelt out to you right?  You will believe it only when he use the term "NIGERIA YOUTHS"? Please What's the meaning of over 60% of a population being below 30years seating and doing nothing because they produce oil?  It's your view after all.
337 2018-04-19 23:16:24 Went shopping, got my iPhone fixed, sushi & an oil change. Today was a win. (My bank account says otherwise tho)

339 2018-04-19 23:16:13 Every time I get my oil changed professionally done something breaks 
340 2018-04-19 23:16:02 That's not a bad thing. 
We had presidents promoting big oil, with shares in them and others that became multi million aires after their presidency. Nothing said; but because Inanka is a Trump we have reprocussion. Not the way to go.
341 2018-04-19 23:16:00 Wow can’t believe I can feel the fact that I’ve not taken any CBD oil for the past few days, I feel horrible and my anxiety is through the roof? I can’t get over how much it works and makes me feel normal again ? I’m so happy I found it

363 2018-04-19 23:13:10 That's not a HONDA! congrats and the best of luck to you
364 2018-04-19 23:13:08 In other words: broken. A broken federation. Can’t understand how the Supremes came to this decision, and can’t get over the hypocrisy of places like Quebec who hate our oil, but love the money they get because of our oil, and like to kick us when we’re down.
365 2018-04-19 23:12:49 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.

379 2018-04-19 23:11:23 Wow! If this Buhari called Nigerian youths lazy, he must be on something. Tf? Or maybe he's referring to the one from his generation. Shame it may be amnesia. So his memory is backdated. What oil money are the youths waiting on? Do we still have oil money? 
380 2018-04-19 23:11:21 As long as they have Brock Lesnar guy,  geddy lee and his mom clap clap clapping for all they do they're happy. If they can keep getting Saudi oil barons and TV companies subsidizing them maybe they won't need to sell tickets anymore
381 2018-04-19 23:11:10 What has occupied the poor Canadian garrison mindset since 2017?
- Softwood

What did they ignore during that time? Massive technological advancements in artificial intelligence, self driving cars, online retail and manufacturing. Basically the entire advanced economy

388 2018-04-19 23:10:50 I think they are desperate to push fossil fuel. They've run out of good reasons.

So, he's trying the good old scare tactic.

I've had it with their scare campaigns.

We need oil for national security?

Complete nonsense.

We need that senator replaced.

402 2018-04-19 23:09:30 It is out of place to conclude that over 60% of Nigerian youths are illiterate and depend on oil money. Sir,how many of these youths have access to oil money?
403 2018-04-19 23:09:26 Joel Osteen is a money grabbing waste of human space.

He contributes nothing to humanity. In fact he detracts by fleecing gullible people.

413 2018-04-19 23:08:00 The FDA approved Marinol (Schedule III) which is a 100% (synthetically created) THC solution suspended in fish oil - that performs horribly compared to full-spectrum extracts or raw flower. CBD on its own may help some, but it works better in combo w/other cannabinoids.
414 2018-04-19 23:07:58 No way! Oil is so safe, right?
415 2018-04-19 23:07:55 There are some ear mite treatments that can be shared with all family pets in the house safely.

416 2018-04-19 23:07:52 I mean I said it to make a point - which is exactly the point you made....when things get acrimonious, nobody wins...which is why all of us innocent bystanders in BC are questioning your Premiers insane consumer oil and gas policy against us.
417 2018-04-19 23:07:48 My skin got so oily out of the blue. Like whyyy? I can literally touch my forehead and there is oil on my fingers

419 2018-04-19 23:07:41 The answer is no, no, they did not. They wouldnt have sold us Alaska for dirt cheap if they would have known about the oil just sitting there under the earth.

431 2018-04-19 23:06:09 has anyone tried using body lotions etc infused with cbd oil for muscle pain or chronic pain etc? I've been interested in trying it but not sure if it's a waste of money?
432 2018-04-19 23:06:07 Dice the cucumbers finely and then cut the bread into croutons and bake in the oven. Place the croutons on the diced cucumbers. Add olive oil, salt/pepper, and balsamic vinegar.

442 2018-04-19 23:04:44 not sure if im actually tired or if the fumes from my oil burner are too strong --
443 2018-04-19 23:04:44 Illinois isn't as blue as Cook, Lake & St. Clair counties would lead you to believe it is.
444 2018-04-19 23:04:41 If you ever need an oil change or brakes I’m more then happy to to them!
445 2018-04-19 23:04:26 You would think that the fact that China invested ~$35 billion in Canada's energy sector might indicate that there is, in fact, a market for heavy oil.
446 2018-04-19 23:04:26 You can infuse milk the same way you would infuse oil or butter.  The milk can make all kinds of non cake desserts.
447 2018-04-19 23:04:25 Throw some peppermint oil in ya conditioner during your deep condition and thank me later
448 2018-04-19 23:04:24 My relationship with God is like your grandmother’s relationship with God. Not your religious granny but the power filled, pray down heaven and rebuke hell, filled with the Holy Ghost grandmother. The one that pleads the blood of Jesus and anoints her house with holy oil.
449 2018-04-19 23:04:23 YALL CONTAMINATED DA OIL
450 2018-04-19 23:04:07 Who has a fuckin jug of oil hahahahahah
451 2018-04-19 23:04:07 what is the difference between "a lot" and "most"  @MobilePunch 
“A lot of them haven’t been to school and they are claiming, you know, that Nigeria has been an oil producing country therefore they should sit and do nothing and get housing, health care, education, free,” Buhari
452 2018-04-19 23:03:56 Told you to keep topping up the suncream not baby oil you tit 
453 2018-04-19 23:03:43 "Saudi Arabia's like ISIS, just with a lot of oil" @RaniaKhalek  please co host more podcasts this is fantastic @strugglesesh
454 2018-04-19 23:03:34 I wouldn't be against hardware with that purple "oil slick" finish.
455 2018-04-19 23:03:33 it's cooking oil. chill
456 2018-04-19 23:03:15 I hope it works for mine! That’s what i did and i put coconut oil in it 
457 2018-04-19 23:03:10 All I have is dried herb... could make oil or butter... but I want something different... something unique. Like Trifle!
458 2018-04-19 23:03:07 Thank u almighty oil
459 2018-04-19 23:02:58 @carolemacneil #nntonight.  Hmmmm  I wonder if Beer according to the SCC affects oil?  Who has the better hand?.  Horgan or Notley?
460 2018-04-19 23:02:55 In fact you could literally make a pasta dish for like £1.50 per portion. Even less if you used an egg or oil/ butter based sauce.
461 2018-04-19 23:02:50 wtf is a hair test?? what kind of companies do you work for?? better get over to oil and gas!!!
462 2018-04-19 23:02:46 Another analogy would be to think of private companies. Suppose you are a raw materials supplier to a BigCo and they process your orders in dollars. If you suddenly quoted in gold, yes prices would be more stable (oil would be around 15). But they would soon quit doing biz w/you.
463 2018-04-19 23:02:42 Oh Brian, I LOVE this! "The musky scent of oil and apathy." YES!
464 2018-04-19 23:02:31 Print it and then what’s the bitch gonna do?

Then continues ripping a skull in half.
469 2018-04-19 23:02:16 Was referring specifically to oil, hence the reference to transport policy.
470 2018-04-19 23:02:15 "Week of the young child"! Artsy Thursday. Our children used paint, oil pastels, and watercolors to make a collage! 
471 2018-04-19 23:01:59 How High Can Trump Push Oil Prices? 
@realDonaldTrump, I’m not a US citizen but I strongly believe that Trump is one of the best US president in 20th century. He can Push oil and anything he want. Strong leader and very talanted
472 2018-04-19 23:01:55 Stop being so rational. Clearly a Russian bot. Only an assadist Putin apologist would ask such ridiculous questions. Next you’ll ask which banks transferred the money as oil isn’t bought in suitcases full of cash.

477 2018-04-19 23:01:12 Wow, Susan... that is just such a fabrication! You will never convince me that many or most of the nasty, divisive remarks against political rivals has been reprehensible.  But I don't expect anything less from people who defend the defenseless!
478 2018-04-19 23:01:09 It’s for real. My bearded husband keeps it *super* minimal (like owns no other products) but admits the beard oil stuff is pretty necessary.
479 2018-04-19 23:00:49 Here are the Lazy youths waiting for oil money.
480 2018-04-19 23:00:47 They want you to hate Russia because they don't want Russia to have oil.  #Syria
481 2018-04-19 23:00:41 They're still be foreign oil coming in. Why not process Canadian oil in Canada? More jobs for Canadians and you'll get a lot more money for exports of refined product.
482 2018-04-19 23:00:35 My tweet was about oil, hence the reference to transport. We have decades of gas production left, and the reality is we need to transition and find alternatives in the next few decades.

486 2018-04-19 23:00:14 Oil from the Ferrari's?
487 2018-04-19 23:00:12 Fake news support #GreenEnergy ....oil is killing the planet and it’s unsustainable.....greedy ppl R using disinformation to scare you #GETWOKE
488 2018-04-19 23:00:08 Heard coconut oil is good ...
 Who sells coconut oil here tho ?? 
   The  wants to Glow......
489 2018-04-19 23:00:06 If you can't disrupt the supply there you disrupt the supply here to keep the oil moving higher based on fears created by the news, so called accidents and terrorists.
490 2018-04-19 22:59:56 imagine if you even learned to change your own oil
self sufficiency is the fiction you imagine.
491 2018-04-19 22:59:48 The protesters are nothing but hypocrites for protesting oil, but use oil and oil based products dailey.

493 2018-04-19 22:59:41 My tweet was referring specifically to oil. Hence the reference to transport policy. We have decades of gas, as well. Plenty of time to transition.
494 2018-04-19 22:59:31 Thanks for the update, Brian. I will put all of these advertisers on my boycott list except ExxonMobil, which has already been on my boycott list since their drunken skipper ran a supertanker full of oil aground in Prince William Sound in Alaska. Let's hit 'em in the wallet.
495 2018-04-19 22:59:29 Me dijieron a las 19:00hs en la Oil, mira la hora que es y recien me despierto
496 2018-04-19 22:59:26 Sir, that is the reality, that is the truth. Oil money (easy money)
497 2018-04-19 22:59:16 Obviously as per usual for Big Oil, but it's not going to fly this time.
498 2018-04-19 22:59:15 Yes, that is the norm George, most fire departments have specialized training financed by organizations such as oil companies.  For example my company provides numerous fire departments foam etc. for training, FOC! Steve, most tank farms/refineries have industrial fire depts 1/2

500 2018-04-19 22:58:50 Just saw on NBC Nightly News that the FDA is going to approve an oil from cannabis through a pharmaceutical corporation.  How much will it cost the patient to get it from a drug company as opposed to a legal cannabis distributor?
501 2018-04-19 22:58:44 arms & back day yesterday and my triceps are on fire   how much fish oil is enough fish oil
502 2018-04-19 22:58:13 @dominos_india Stop exploiting people's health by swapping real cheese with a vicious mix of oil and mayo that explodes the calorie count off the roof. Just cus India does not require by law to display calories, doesn't mean you kill people with atrocious junk.  #boycottDominos
503 2018-04-19 22:58:07 there's a giant oil plant fire and local news is doing a story about a Gainesville, Florida police officer who plays basketball with kids
504 2018-04-19 22:58:06 There are many dangerous industries where goods are made by low-wage workers under abusive conditions. Some would even say they're mfg'd in exploitative working conditions. Apparel, Seafood and Palm OIl are just a few.
505 2018-04-19 22:58:06 Trying clove oil now!
506 2018-04-19 22:57:52 Do you even lift...babies?
507 2018-04-19 22:57:43 Such a purist!  Currently, your life is depends on all oil. I guess you prefer to screw Canada and supports dictators and regimes with no human rights. The solar panel industry in Saudi is a weak one mate... Your life depends on fossil fuels, face it. How did they make your car?
508 2018-04-19 22:57:38 This is what Prime Ministers do,not open borders indiscriminately,wear costumes, constantly go on vacations and tell the world that you wish you could destroy the livelyhood of Canadians dependant on oil much faster.Our hopes are with:

510 2018-04-19 22:57:23 boiling in oil comes to mind.
511 2018-04-19 22:57:23 Mr Man.. "seat down at home expecting freebies because you are from an oil producing nation".

What is the common name given to such a person?
- Lazy
- Agbaya
- Legbere

Etc..
512 2018-04-19 22:57:12 Oh Matt...how awful! I really hope it subsides. Soak some cotton wool in vodka or whiskey and apply to tooth. Clove oil also numbs. Big hug.
513 2018-04-19 22:57:12 #We don’t depend on the country’s oil to survive

We have to write WAEC, JAMB, POST UTME just to enter a Nigerian University

With our certificate, we’re poorly paid yet we manage to survive

The Nigerian Youths are not lazy, we just have a failed President!

#LazyNigerianYouths
514 2018-04-19 22:57:03 If you continue to use oil, having your own guanteed supply secures your nation from having an external supply cut off (in theory). Its a rubbish argument though as Aussie oil is classified as "light and sweet" and we import ""heavy crude" (plastics/lubricants) iirc.
515 2018-04-19 22:56:57 Funny to sit back and watch these nitwits try and out-liberal each other. Liars, con artists, snake oil salesmen, puppets from coast to coast. Moonbeam Brown in Ca to this icon of idiocy. How can everybody not see through his bs? Pass the popcorn.

518 2018-04-19 22:56:53 Burning mid night candles so i can be called to bar, yet oil and pepper stains my books from cooking. It's not called suffering, it's called an investment, the season of massive is here. I will rise. Someday, I'll rest but today, I work. Jehovah sees. Shalom.
519 2018-04-19 22:56:51 Yikes. You beat me, sir. Just oil & air filter here. Well done though. Man-card renewed for 5 yrs for you.
520 2018-04-19 22:56:47 Lol.. You want do like oyinbo..Our forefathers have sold our integrity alongside the oil.
521 2018-04-19 22:56:45 EZ shares -0.1%, US shares -0.6% led by tech stocks. US 10 yr yld +4bp to 2.91%. Oil -0.4% to $68.2, gold -0.2% to $1346.4, iron ore +3.7% to $68.6. ASX futures -0.2%. $A 0.7725 as $US index +0.5%
522 2018-04-19 22:56:38 @leomu no, RSI was higher before oil hit all time high, it didn’t follow the move, it’s called RSI divergence
523 2018-04-19 22:56:30 I am a self employed student,I'm not waiting to benefit from the oil revenues reserved for the bourgeoisie I am not lazy

524 2018-04-19 22:56:09 you sell snake oil to mentally unstable people under the guise of nationalism @RealAlexJones. I think if you were smarter you'd be ashamed. You're like a tornado filed with snake oil, douchebags, beta males, and lawsuits. We're laughing at you.

530 2018-04-19 22:55:20 @jimcramer @WarrenBuffetHQ I will try and make a wild assumption _ some companies in the energy (oil), industrial sector (steel), consumer discretionary (Cannibus),  want to c which ones will I be interested either investing in or possible capital allocation (interesting) - well
531 2018-04-19 22:55:14 Oh GREAT tomorrow is 420, I'll just tell ya know kids, Ur NOT COOL, " OH ITS 420 DERPP," ok it's a damn medicine, and LMFAO 420 SON that's 25/8 for me

537 2018-04-19 22:54:22 #LazyNigerianYouths Our president didn't make use of the word "LAZY". He was referring to the uneducated youths who want free things because the country produces oil. That statement didn't even sound like an insult.....he was only giving an instant.
538 2018-04-19 22:54:21 So then, does this make  it okay for AB to restrict oil and gas exports to British Columbia? This is ridiculous and Trudeau allowing interprovincial border wars to unfold like this, is more anti-Canadian than any of his other destructive behavior and policies.
539 2018-04-19 22:54:15 3/Scott Pruitt to run the Environmental PROTECTION Agency! He is a climate change denier, works for the oil & coal lobbyists to repeal environmental regulations and sued the EPA 13 times over clean air/water regulations as OK A.G.
540 2018-04-19 22:54:09 Even the Saudis are building solar. Maybe you’ve been sniffing too much oil and haven’t noticed the world is changing.
541 2018-04-19 22:54:03 “Under the bus”? That’s your modus operandi! You’re funny! You would be a great comedian though you are infinitely better at finding customers for your snake oil! Got to give you credit for that! After Sarah Palin you are the best! Have to #resist you though, for America’s sake!!
542 2018-04-19 22:53:56 Cooking with bubbling oil without a shirt! It's so exciting!
543 2018-04-19 22:53:54 A little bit of coconut oil can solve anything
544 2018-04-19 22:53:29 I think it's when we hit $4 a gallon. If we hit $5 we will have a recession. A lot of people worry about an inverted yield curve but I worry more about high oil prices.
545 2018-04-19 22:53:26 Don't misinterpret Mr. President, what he said was, "a lot of Nigerian youth below 30 years of age,  haven't go to school and they remain idle, waiting for the government to build houses for them, give them all luxury life they want, pride of their oil rich country".
546 2018-04-19 22:53:23 I used this new coconut oil today and now my hair smells like a whole snack
547 2018-04-19 22:53:13 If it wasn't for Russia..they would've killed Assad by now & turned syria into a complete shit hole, (as they did to Libya and iraq).The west wouldve taken full control of all the oil fields & balkanized Syria into 4 smaller states, 3 parts for Israel, turkey, Kurds & 1 for syria

561 2018-04-19 22:51:48 No sorry there's no olive oil on it
562 2018-04-19 22:51:42 Just did it today. New oil, blade, air filter and spark plug . 10 year old mower still works great.
563 2018-04-19 22:51:40 Today, I got to interview the CTO of Siemens about internet of things and electrification of transport, for a documentary we're making. You wouldn't believe how excited I was when he got his oil-to-car diagram out.
564 2018-04-19 22:51:28 What has FIFA got to do with oil prices?
565 2018-04-19 22:51:25 What a pile of rubbish, Canada has the most well regulated oil and gas industry in the world.  Canada is responsible for under 2% of total GHG emissions world wide.  CO2 is NOT pollution!
566 2018-04-19 22:51:17 They are already good!! Also, the beauty of an EV is its cheaper (good for cost focused), gets us of oil (Good for nat security and economic sec), cleaner (there’s your enviro), faster (zero 60 is WOW!). 

Basically EVs are just better for everyone!

569 2018-04-19 22:50:56 I would trust Burnaby Fire Department in containing fire over oil industry people, many of whom have no idea how to deal with the steep terrain on Burnaby Mountain  where oil storage tanks sit
570 2018-04-19 22:50:55 I hate taking medicine unless I'm in severe pain so I put peppermint oil on my back and now I smell like a piece of gum at work nice

573 2018-04-19 22:50:35 "Nigerian youths are lazy&uneducated. Always wanting free oil money" PMB:
Sir, you are absolutely correct. One of the lazy Nigerian youths who is enjoying free oil money had an accident with the power bike he bought with free oil money not too long ago, and he was flown abroad.
574 2018-04-19 22:50:32 Here we go... dirty oil versus ethical oil.  Like a script out of Greenpeace trash novel. Go live and take your electric car to Venezuela (or Saudi Arabia) and let’s see how you enjoy that scenario. Good luck Vinny! Good luck.
575 2018-04-19 22:50:17 @RaypowerNetwork in dis country wia I provide everrythin I need by my self,electricity,security,medics,etc, and some1 is here telin me we are oil rich country,wat have I benefitted from d so cold oil rich country,abeg some1 should not provoke me I don't lik cursin people at night
576 2018-04-19 22:50:11 The question is, is that baby oil in the bottle in Carls hand?
577 2018-04-19 22:50:11 I have to disagree and say that if there was more research for both your specific epilepsy and cannabis treatment, I think CBD oil/cannabis in general would help. At least for the headaches and depression.
578 2018-04-19 22:50:05 You seem to understand it just fine, Will...

579 2018-04-19 22:50:04 Love that I took my car in at 8 AM for an oil change and it’s still not done
580 2018-04-19 22:49:59 Dimming the midnight oil
581 2018-04-19 22:49:49 It’s odd, but if a doctor was to say something similar in medicine, they wouldn’t be told it’s ‘semantics’. 

I want people to solve the actual cause of the issues. ‘Fracking’ is being used as a bogeyman - a term wrongly used to mean ‘everything that can happen in oil and gas’.
582 2018-04-19 22:49:39 please preorder my band’s single my bandmate really needs her oil changed please
583 2018-04-19 22:49:36 ขายไปแล้วนะคะนุช ขอบคุณทุกคนที่ช่วยรีนะคะ ม๊วฟ 
584 2018-04-19 22:49:33 Obvious but still true life hack: Tea tree oil is great for zits but if you get it in your eye its like having your cornea bludgeoned to death with a tube of toothpaste I AM TYPING THIS HALF BLIND
585 2018-04-19 22:49:23 However the oil version is like 821.64 MB, and the pixar one is 270.28 MB. They're hefty overhauls.
586 2018-04-19 22:49:11 オイルだからってオイルツイートばかりな訳じゃないぞ。油ツイートもするよ。
587 2018-04-19 22:49:10 Oh, I will keep up the fight. We’ve defeated Energy East and we won’t stop until the oil era comes to an end.
588 2018-04-19 22:49:04 The more I think about this it’s all about oil and Russia having a warm water port. They will build a pipeline thru Turkey and take care of the Kurds for Turkey. Access for illuminating Turkey’s enemy.
589 2018-04-19 22:48:58 Prez Buhari also said a section of the uneducated 60% of our populace, want welfare from what they "claim" to be an oil producing Country
590 2018-04-19 22:48:57 NASA has nothing to do with those industries. And with advancements in technology will allow the use of coal and oil without carbon emissions. No need to destroy industries that help our economy,
591 2018-04-19 22:48:55 Prayers to my oil and gas industry  brothers hope everyone is ok

597 2018-04-19 22:48:00 Cut it into rounds/coins, brush with oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and bake at 400° for 20-30 mins. 
598 2018-04-19 22:47:58 Rosehip oil
599 2018-04-19 22:47:50 Buhari said Nigerian youth are lazy that they are depending on oil money to survive lol  I guess it maybe groundnut oil and  olive oil, palm oil, canola oil, corn oil, peanut oil, sunflower oil, avocado oil 
he was talking about #nigerianyoutharelazy
600 2018-04-19 22:47:44 If that's the case just give me the gun oil and a room.

606 2018-04-19 22:46:45 Getting an oil change because I need it and because I'm going to hang in Pittsburgh with the bro this weekend
607 2018-04-19 22:46:40 Get me some 3&1 oil and some ball bearings.

612 2018-04-19 22:45:49 Does someone want to tell me why the fuck ride now gave me Honda oil and not Kawasaki? They gave me Kawasaki diff fluid but not oil?
613 2018-04-19 22:45:12 The oil plant near by exploded. Nothing like breathing in cancer causing chemicals
614 2018-04-19 22:44:58 Running low on protein powder so I ordered a 5lbs Rule 1 Whey blend. Also have been out of Vitamin C Serum, so I’m trying this Asorbic Acid suspension from Ordinary (since Vitamin C is not stable... I’d been worried the serums are snake oil)
615 2018-04-19 22:44:56 5. Deep fried twinkies
4. Deep fried Oreos
3. Deep fried pizza
2. Deep fried oil
1. Deep fried

In that order.
616 2018-04-19 22:44:41 We see then: the means of production, however for about a week until the soap has absorbed the oil.
617 2018-04-19 22:44:34 That was my take I mostly use olive oil need to try coconut or palm when I fry up fish or try baking instead.
618 2018-04-19 22:44:02 Dan has already stated minimum $2 per litre starting point if no pipeline. I drive for a living and to pay for school, the cost of food, and everything transported by oil & gas will go up. Im glad you can afford that, I cannot. Good day to you.
619 2018-04-19 22:43:57 For pizza I need flour, yeast, olive oil, mozzarella cheese, tomato sauce and ham. I have water and salt.
#Englishclasscecy
620 2018-04-19 22:43:50 Wanna change oil? Lol
621 2018-04-19 22:43:48 Hmmm. Have tapenade? Or some sort of bitter green? (Nasturtiums would be perfect if spring was real). Toast the baguette, spread with tapenade (and cream cheese if possible), slice the cukes super thin, toss with olive oil, bitter green, pepper and layer on spread.
622 2018-04-19 22:43:45 Canadian Federal Government,  WHY would you sign a 4.1 billion dollar infrastructure agreement with BC when they won’t let you move OUR own oil? They make us buy Saudi oil??? R u crazy? Trudeau,  get that Federally Approved pipeline built. Enough!

I start getting cold in a hot bath water and jumped out to dry off like it would stop but it didn’t 

worked wonders for my cramps though 
641 2018-04-19 22:41:24 You believe the oil industry, i believe our environment is more valuable. Different set of priorities in life I guess.
642 2018-04-19 22:41:18 Their most likely the same people who own the oil companies. And the Telecom companies. Google some of the CEO names you'll figure it out. They have fairly distinctive names. Have you figured it out yet?
643 2018-04-19 22:41:17 I got this oil today called “Niggah stop sweating me” and it damn for sure gon make niggahs sweat you

645 2018-04-19 22:41:10 I an going to bet it has more to do with blocking oil deliveries and naval action rather than nukes. War on horizon? Is Israel ready for that?

#LazyNigerianYouths
659 2018-04-19 22:39:47 This is true! As we transition to near zero carbon emissions by 2050 we should be pursuing those sources who total emissions are lowest. I’d be love to see any data that compares total emissions from oil sands compared to say Middle East oil, or even coal?
660 2018-04-19 22:39:43 These comments show how racist America really is the minute of American is hurt or killed people are really affected but s*** if an Iraqi is murdered over a oil grab so be it...

665 2018-04-19 22:38:27 Capillary diameter is important (too large and it will leak, too small and it will clog). If the tube is in plastic or in glass may also affect surface tension (I think glass was better for me). Mineral oil is not crucial if you control evaporation + work with 100% water atm.
666 2018-04-19 22:38:27 Does it feel good to grind Blanche into penury beneath your heel, lording over the fact that you own what is soon to be a ghost town in a drilled-out former oil region?
667 2018-04-19 22:38:23 Happy 8th anniversary to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the largest marine oil spill in the history of the petroleum industry
668 2018-04-19 22:38:21 I heard him say: Youths want to get
school,healthcare,power free because Nigeria is an oil country, I don't hear him said youths are lazy. Can you
please send me your own video if you think mine doesn't cover that particular say?
669 2018-04-19 22:38:09 It does cause a lot of alcoholism, cirrhosis, and brain damage, far more than an oil spill! And domestic violence!
670 2018-04-19 22:37:59 "Nigerian youths are lazy & uneducated. Always wanting free oil money" ~ PMB

ME: Sir, you are absolutely correct. One of the lazy Nigerian youths who is enjoying free oil money had an accident with the power bike
671 2018-04-19 22:37:50 I would respectfully suggest someone  cocked up their service and didn’t put the correct amount of oil in,  If any, as Bike mainly used for short journeys.
672 2018-04-19 22:37:48 I put Cacay oil on my hair to condition it :). You can buy it in Holland and Barrett.
673 2018-04-19 22:37:38 The world, this country could make converting to renewables an all in challenge to save the earth and us along with her, but the 1% still all in on oil and gas
674 2018-04-19 22:37:25 it happens. Olive oil mixed with a little lavender oil in her bath or massaged into the scalp works wonders ..
675 2018-04-19 22:37:18 Oil change and inspection 
676 2018-04-19 22:37:13 Gartman just got stopped out of his oil short today so maybe a small green day tomorrow? but shouldn't beat today's high, so look to short at tomorrow's highs
677 2018-04-19 22:37:12 Yes, because it’s water based and super drying on the skin. All of the PR packages came with an oil for it.
678 2018-04-19 22:37:10 Seems reasonable. Triple the canvas size and oil to paint it.
679 2018-04-19 22:37:07 Nah- I’m just saying what’s inside is what matters more than what’s on the outside. Actions speak louder than words- “amigos,” notwithstanding. 
680 2018-04-19 22:37:06 Yup, I remember and I read it and still think that the oil is somehow more important than we think. Koch Bros have been actively directing this country into a different direction thru State Elect  & GOP is practically bought & paid 4 by Kochs "Foundations" top donars.
681 2018-04-19 22:36:35 school, and thy are claiming that Nigeria is an oil producing country and they think they can sit down and do nothing and get housing, health care and education free." So y'all should explain how he called the youth/ literate people lazy. 2/2
682 2018-04-19 22:36:26 No leaks, no drips. Nothing.  Modern bikes don’t use that amount of oil in 4 months. Also no warning lights re oil pressure/level etc.
683 2018-04-19 22:36:18 Wait... Oil?!?

688 2018-04-19 22:35:35 All they have to do is find Oil in their lands and USA military will comeback  in a blink of a eye.

694 2018-04-19 22:34:55 Na not vegan just ended up right by this place and it looked fun! 

Southern Italian food is super easy to make vegan because other than a little pork and occasional cheese it really relies on veggies, carbs and olive oil!
695 2018-04-19 22:34:37 I have a bottle in the pantry. It has sunflower and I was indeed wrong AGAIN about the vegetable oil but it's worse than I thought, it's fuckin canola. They fry donuts in canola dude don't drink it straight
696 2018-04-19 22:34:37 Got my oil changed! Now to make comfort food and watch Gotham! It's been a bad mental day.

701 2018-04-19 22:34:29 I suggest Alberta reduce the flow of oil/gas to BC out of concern for the health and safety of their economy.
702 2018-04-19 22:34:27 Year old bike.  Serviced 4 months ago,  oil filters etc.   Now engine completely seized.  Not a drop of oil in the engine. Took dump nut off. A dribble of oil came out.  Dealers response.  Not our problem. You should’ve checked the oil.  Maintenance yes. No oil whatsoever, no
703 2018-04-19 22:34:27 You weren't dumb. You were just persuaded by promises of swift & effective action in the face of Gaddafi's blood curdling threats against his own populace. Libya was oil rich. Gaddafi gone it would be an economically flourishing democracy. No need for strategy. It'd sort itself.
704 2018-04-19 22:34:23 I use olive oil......but also use a forgotten SOS pad to clean my cast iron and stainless pans.
705 2018-04-19 22:33:59 They hold the aces to cleaner energy but consumers have a role to play... Oil majors have the funds and expertise but waiting for either market forces or regulation to increase the pace to greener energy
706 2018-04-19 22:33:37 Aspirin is derived from willow bark. Penicillin comes from a mold. Sometimes a concentrated essential oil formula is just stronger & easier to take. Percentages of THC & CBD can be reliably measured, adjusted, & standardized in a lab for consistent quality, purity, & potency.

710 2018-04-19 22:32:25 As the senate sponsor, HB-1157 would have increased reporting of oil and gas incidents, as well as transparency and public access to these reports. Today it was killed in committee on a party line vote. #coleg #copolitics
711 2018-04-19 22:32:20 What is this. An oil company?
712 2018-04-19 22:32:20 This would cause the price of oil to rise. It’s good for everyone in the oil industry...except Valero of course.
713 2018-04-19 22:32:13 Sunflower oil = vegetable oil?
714 2018-04-19 22:32:11 So, in essence, GreedPeace supports big oil so long as it is US big oil to the detriment of the economic and social development of indigenous peoples in Canada. I doubt that GreedPeace will respond, because they have a track record of running away from the facts.

720 2018-04-19 22:31:13 Also, you say " Kurdistan’s oil export pipelines to Turkey". Are you referring here to the KRG operated line, as well as the one that used to be operated by Baghdad before 2014? Thanks.

723 2018-04-19 22:31:11 I'm amazed how many people think that baseball is like a car that will run forever without an oil change or a new fan belt. Do you people take your Oldsmobiles to the shop and tell the mechanic not to touch anything because the old baby is perfect as is?
724 2018-04-19 22:31:02 Depends, most people recommend water pump, oil pump and tensioner. If the vehicle has over 140k. My recommendation is if you or you have a friend that knows about cars buy the parts and have the shop put them on that will save you some money.
725 2018-04-19 22:31:01 BCers also pay less tax due to oil revenues from Alberta. In fact many of those opposed and collecting gov’t handouts are sipping from that same cup. Where do ya think all that dough comes from? Oh right. From the raw sewage dumped in their pristine ocean!! #hypocrites

731 2018-04-19 22:30:43 Yea ? Alberta isn’t the only place with oil on this planet?
732 2018-04-19 22:30:41 Yes ideally everything should be labelled as to whether it contains Palm oil or not. At least that would raise awareness. And many might even deliberately avoid it, thus dramatically reducing demand for it.

741 2018-04-19 22:30:01 Must be the oil company owners don’t have enough money.
742 2018-04-19 22:29:56 GreedPeace states that indigenous rights are threatened, but does not mention that over 40 indigenous nations support the pipeline.
Those that oppose the pipelines have been given Millions of dollars by US ENGOs many of which are in turn, are funded by Big US Oil.
743 2018-04-19 22:29:54 Western intervention is never about people. It is always about money and power. Iraq was all about oil. Syria is all about Assad's opposition to the Qatar-Turkey-Southern Europe gas pipeline crossing Syrian territory. Oil, gas, money, power. Absolutely NOTHING to do with people!

748 2018-04-19 22:29:28 You're confused Lori I am not against Alberta Oil, what I am saying is when the tap is turned off, ironically they will turn to imported oil and I'm saying put tariffs on that imported oil.
749 2018-04-19 22:29:04 2) As IEA reported, "Over 70% of global energy demand growth was met by oil, natural gas and coal, while renewables accounted for almost all of the rest." i.e., majority of capacity added (renewables) could only provide 30% of consumption increase.

757 2018-04-19 22:28:12 Agreed. Also, it doesn’t matter whether the sea level is higher because of the melted ice or because of the Archimedes principle of world trash and plastic islands raising sea level. The plastic islands and seeing companies dump oil in the water should suffice.
758 2018-04-19 22:28:05 Is 710 the 420 for dabs because if you turn it upside down and backwards it looks like OIL?

803 2018-04-19 22:22:59 during the oil market crash exporters couldn't stand to see reduced income so they started producing and selling more. Alberta is doing the same thing with the new #Pipeline. They're just too late.

829 2018-04-19 22:20:41 Agreed. Though the court case could further complicate any overarching settlement over oil and gas rights, ie hydrocarbon law. Your suggested solution, though, would inject a win-win option and possibly garner some goodwill.

844 2018-04-19 22:19:51 That’s basically how I just fixed it! Instead of avocado oil (which sounds way better) I used olive oil, salt and pepper at 425 for 17 minutes.
845 2018-04-19 22:19:32 why should people invest in Nigeria

More than 60% of the population is below 30, a lot of them haven’t been to school and they are claiming that Nigeria is an oil producing country, therefore, they should sit and do nothing, and get housing, healthcare, education for free.”.
846 2018-04-19 22:19:26 Oil pulling really works to whiten your teeth

848 2018-04-19 22:18:49 u know it’s summer when your coconut oil melts
849 2018-04-19 22:18:48 Line 5 should and must be shut down. So long as we are unable to guarantee the integrity of the pipeline, we cannot allow for the possibility of oil contaminating the largest source of drinking water on earth.
850 2018-04-19 22:18:46 I am a bot. I am a bot. I eat oil for breakfast & grease up in the afternoon. Someday I hope to converted to be a real person as soon as AI gets good enough. In the meantime, I guess I will have to continue to be a bot stuck in the rut of my far afield opinions.  Have a good day!
851 2018-04-19 22:18:36 “1,200 new coal-fired plants on the drawing boards in 59 countries, mostly in Asia, and China was the single largest contributor.”  & Green Peace lies about oil sands Carbon contribution
852 2018-04-19 22:18:27 I wish I could’ve been there to see it in person, but it was beautiful
853 2018-04-19 22:18:24 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic
854 2018-04-19 22:18:24 Ewww no. I don't even like cream in coffee. Oil sludge floating stuff ruins the taste #NotForMe
855 2018-04-19 22:18:20 @dmitryZ_reuters you say: "...Rosneft had taken over ownership of landlocked Kurdistan’s oil export pipelines to Turkey from the KRG in return for $1.8 billion." Does this mean Rosneft is now in control of the line to Ceyhan?
856 2018-04-19 22:18:17 Most of these politicians are d ones that enjoyed d goodness in Nigeria during d so called oil boom and dare put d blames on us?

860 2018-04-19 22:17:49 I just wanna be rubbed down with some oil by my man after soaking in the tub
861 2018-04-19 22:17:37 1) Article & @UNEnvironment hide poor progress by claiming: "in 2017, the world added more solar capacity than coal, gas, and nuclear plants combined."

Capacity is a dubious metric. IEA: "Over 70% of [2017] global energy demand growth was met by oil, natural gas and coal."
862 2018-04-19 22:17:34 I was gonna start this weekend.  What ya think?
863 2018-04-19 22:17:15 I can here to make this joke shamus. Now I have to find a new one. I’m gonna go with “does it have a button that shoots out oil slicks onto the court?” It’s not good but it’s what I have.
864 2018-04-19 22:17:07 @seabrite222 I wonder why people claiming to be Christian, remain silent while the most sacred anointing oil used by Jesus (recipe comes directly from God - Exodus 30, 22-33) is still illegal in most states (it contains a lot of Cannabis)?
865 2018-04-19 22:16:58 Maybe enlist the help of a fellow burger van entrapenuer .. @Epithemiou  ... He loves a good oil change and bad spelling on a Friday.
866 2018-04-19 22:16:53 How can the President that was brought into by the platform and the power of youth says same youth are lazy and illiterate and looking for free oil money.... Mr. President you have hit this one wrong, I foresee the repeat of what happened in 2015 to GEJ... You will congratulation
867 2018-04-19 22:16:51 Ideas based on flows/blocks, end of day 2018-04-19:

buy bonds, especially AGG, maybe TLT
short XLF/BAC
short FXI for sure, maybe EEM for continuation
buy TEVA
buy SWN
short FB
buy GLD/IAU
short XLE/oil

 Just not as flavoursome as the flavour adheres to the oil

873 2018-04-19 22:15:37 @RealKidPoker Just tried the beyond meat burger and it was very good, but what concerns me is that it has 20g of Fat and if you fry it oil as it reccomends, then that's even more fat. Please educate me on how 20 plus grams of fat can be good for you.
874 2018-04-19 22:15:31 @realDonaldTrump please do not let the gas prices get out of control in US. If USA is self-sufficient and non dependent on foreign oil then our gas prices should be nominal not climbing because of world events.

878 2018-04-19 22:15:04 #bbqt it must be because  Syria is selling their oil in € instead of $
879 2018-04-19 22:14:53 #bbcqt Or is all this bombing to do with oil??? Oh and don't tell one person to shush if everyone else is doing the same.

Coworker: and someone spilled oil all over so watch your step
Me: hides oil covered sleeve from earlier when I tossed in an empty oil box that wasn't actually empty

Kill All The Trees In The Igbo Villages.
Do Not Allow Igbos To Stay In Your Villages And Poison Your Trees.
882 2018-04-19 22:14:31 Any baby oil yet? 
883 2018-04-19 22:14:28 #bbcqt we talk about Syria and Yemen but no one talks about the atrocities in Venezuela because it’s too near the US who are stealing cheap oil for themselves

890 2018-04-19 22:13:29 It was filthy, but I had so much pride inside when I was cleaning it! Baby wipes do more then wipe baby asses! Basically I need to camp there with pledge, Murphy’s oil soap and a pop up tent to keep it pristine!
891 2018-04-19 22:13:27 And just maybe that’s what’s all wrong with your voting system, whoever raises the most money has the best chance of success, not policies or goals but who had the most money,no wonder the NRA and Oil gets people elected, cap donations.

894 2018-04-19 22:13:00 Je voudrais pouvoir aider, mais même ma langue d'oil est merdique.

I think it might help a little if @Google Translate and the like would support the Occitanian (and Frisian and other threatened language) dialects. I would certainly appreciate it.

There is a TON u can do! Good luck!

911 2018-04-19 22:11:38 You wrote a book about Scheer cheating to get the Con leadership using fake Con memberships & then u pull the book? What’s wrong with that picture?

912 2018-04-19 22:11:36 @City_tv I don't know what's dumber. These mothers saying there using this cannabis oil cause they get to hung over from alcohol or you guys for actually having a segment on the subject.
913 2018-04-19 22:11:30 Here’s my take on Ft MAC. There was this tar seeping out of the banks of the Athabasca River. Suncor and others have been cleaning it up for over 50 years. They seperate the oil from the sand then put the sand back.
914 2018-04-19 22:11:28 Well its obvious the only reason for United States to support the Saudis is the convenience of oil. I think the Saudi-Israel alliance is far more bizarre itself.

938 2018-04-19 22:07:59 I wonder about that. BC has an argument to restrict oil for environmental, health, and safety reasons for its people. 

Alberta has simply retaliated with a trade war. And the federal government is attempting to infringe on provincial sovereignty to force the pipeline through.
939 2018-04-19 22:07:53 He said we are waiting for some oil money and yet elders like himself under his administration are using monkey and snake to consume the money... he blames Nigerian youth for that like he’s blaming past government for his unfortunate ruling #LazyNigerianYouths
940 2018-04-19 22:07:40 2/ how the reputation of .@CommBank @AMP_AU can survive this is simple. Australians are just like Midnight Oil sing, “Short Memory”, if we were elephants we’d both opt out as customers/investors and leave these ruthless money factory machines. #BankingRC
941 2018-04-19 22:07:24 Mostly it addresses Starbucks immediate PR problem. It's unfortunate that it also lends credence to implicit bias theory which has not proved replicable and is probably snake oil.

Why not? What about this suggests that when the SHTF she wont be just as effective as any other trained soldier?

For about 30seconds, US kids thought soldiers were good guys again...

Not just pillagers hired by oil tycoons, or torturers of prisoners of war

For 30secs
950 2018-04-19 22:06:30 You're afraid to meet with your constituents. You can't sell that snake oil in person because there would be questions about your brain-dead platitudes.

952 2018-04-19 22:06:14 I'm all for public ownership, but I don't think an oil pipeline is something we should be investing in.
953 2018-04-19 22:06:11 Shoulda put oil on like we used to do in the garden

975 2018-04-19 22:03:27 Maybe because it is still 100% illegal to grow weed anywhere. There are raids almost every day. The wax/oil/etc. things may also be completely illegal as well, since they are “preparations”.

983 2018-04-19 22:02:21 The fact that my alma mater has decided to give David Suzuki an honorary degree is baffling. The oil and gas industry has resulted in charitable people giving back to the school and to turn around and give a man so opposed to the industry a prize is embarrassing

987 2018-04-19 22:02:06 That's a lie U.S.Cannot take over oil production from russia.Russia is four times land mass than United states.more oil than any country in the world.
988 2018-04-19 22:01:55 You're laughing, but I ran into a whole tree when I was a freshman in HS. The scar on my face was unavoidable. I put olive oil on it everyday.

991 2018-04-19 22:01:52 .@reneeswilliams yep, how many incorrect/spun fact in @MaximeBernier statement.
You can travel with alcohol it's limited.
Oil can cross borders, the objection is to the pipeline, not trains. 
Illegally cross the border..  you are arrested and processed.
992 2018-04-19 22:01:45 Hi, you can use it a couple of ways. Swipe all over your face and blend as a primer under the rest of your makeup, or on your T-Zone to absorb oil, and you can also pat it on the high points of your cheek for a natural-looking highlight over foundation.

1008 2018-04-19 21:59:03 To bad you don't understand economics.  With oil over $70 this morning and it expected to hit 80 to 100 this year were is it dodgy. Only thing dodgy is you

1015 2018-04-19 21:58:40 Yeah but I went to get an oil change
1016 2018-04-19 21:58:37 So I've been using me lemon oil first thing in the morning and OMG it helps so much with waking me up and getting me started with my day. And at night, lavender on my feet KNOCK ME OUT. It's amazing!
1017 2018-04-19 21:58:05 Welcome Canada - where we are complete pussies and a bbl of oil is worth less than a can of snuff regardless of the west Texas benchmark.
1018 2018-04-19 21:58:04 Oh come on maaaan! You just want to oil up her... shoulder with some sunscreen lotion! I know your moves! I have the same!

1022 2018-04-19 21:57:34 Darn auto correct.  I meant “oil your beat stick”
1023 2018-04-19 21:57:31 It would be interesting to see how 25% drop in total oil consumption would affect oil companies bottom lines (assuming it's more or less even market shrinkage). Reverse economy of scale...  and also how that change would affect consumption of oil as a feedstock, vs recycle or bio
1024 2018-04-19 21:57:28 We are equal No1 with Qatar in LNG export & earn less than 100th or the royalties & have a gas shortage domestically.
We are an exporter of oil already & earn less royalties than any equivalent nation and have high fuel prices domestically.
Why would this be a improvement?

1033 2018-04-19 21:56:23 I'm always curious why nuclear doesn't have more GHG supporters. BC has hydro. Alberta has oil. How about nuclear for Saskatchewan? How about the Maritimes? Hasn't France had considerable success with nuclear power?
1034 2018-04-19 21:56:17 A few youths you say? I'm not sure you understand the state of the matter. Man was breaking down the Nigerian economy. What is Bayelsa's IGR compared to SW states despite its oil resource and teeming youth populace. These are the true indicators he chose to dwell on.
1035 2018-04-19 21:56:14 Funny how these oil rich Middle Eastern countries can afford to buy imported livestock for slaughter, just so they can be killed halal style & not instantly, but can't afford power or refrigeration!! 
1036 2018-04-19 21:56:05 I have a brother who believes in the vision Nigeria, not the current change we have been short changed with, he got a masters in oil and gas engineering and management. He had opportunities to remain, yet he returned to Nigeria.    He currently runs a transport business.
1037 2018-04-19 21:55:58 Its time for a oil change tommorow
1038 2018-04-19 21:55:50 The state of Nigeria's economy is dependent on oil to a large extent. Let's apply the same question to other oil-dependent countries. Case study: Russia, Saudi, Angola. Are things currently better in those countries than they were in 2015?
1039 2018-04-19 21:55:47 Leave it to me to accidentally use a face wash that has avocado oil in it. I broke out in hives, have a headache and am completely exhausted still after Benadryl and sleep. Go allergies!!!

1055 2018-04-19 21:54:34 @aledeh When a man says "they don't want to do anything becos they feel they have oil ,they want education free,housing free,Health free.."  What does that implies Sir?
1056 2018-04-19 21:54:32 We have to talk...
1057 2018-04-19 21:54:19 Sorry but I think that's a weak reason. NL saw how environmental degradation can decimate an economy. Oil from the tar sands is better left in the ground and all the money AB saved from it should be invested in new industries. Oh wait...
1058 2018-04-19 21:54:18 My first thought was that a more urban population would have more access to sugar/seed oil and that causes Alzheimer's.

1064 2018-04-19 21:53:41 In Armenia’s case, the West wants calm. There’s no oil or gas, so no interest except that it not cause trouble.

1079 2018-04-19 21:52:23 A sure sign that oil is near $70 per barrel again; I’ll be paying more next week to stay at the Fairfield Inn in Midland, TX ($399 per night) than to stay at the W on Fort Lauderdale Beach, FL ($299 per night). #Oil #BusinessTravel #Midland #Odessa #Texas

1082 2018-04-19 21:52:09 Hi Sam, there's a large oversupply, which holders of spare capacity can deploy immediately. "Saudi Arabia has usually kept more than 1.5 - 2 million barrels per day of spare capacity on hand for market management" (IEA). Also, NZ produces just 0.014% of global oil supply.

1084 2018-04-19 21:51:28 You’re a backwater snake oil salesman McConnell. Pack it up and leave before we come after you with torches and pitchforks.
1085 2018-04-19 21:51:20 I would prefer that Labour also open up some other mines as well. Perhaps even dig for oil while they are at it.
1086 2018-04-19 21:51:02 We are also in our 6th mass extinction. There will be no more fish or marine life left in 2048 or chocolate. Corporations need to stop destroying our planet with all of their plastic and oil. Right now we have 3 tons of trash to every one time of marine life. :/
1087 2018-04-19 21:51:01 Jiffy lube , getting my oil changed. What you on??
1088 2018-04-19 21:50:58 I keep hearing about air fryers, definitely need to get one. Then use some chili oil. That does sound good
1089 2018-04-19 21:50:55 Isn’t the economy in the national interest? The greens think the country runs on good will. Wake up, it runs on money! Without oil, we will have a much lower standard of living, and NO money for the environment.
1090 2018-04-19 21:50:54 “But to the Son he says, “Your throne, O God, endures forever and ever. You rule with a scepter of justice. You love justice and hate evil. Therefore, O God, your God has anointed you, pouring out the oil of joy on you more than on anyone else.””

1101 2018-04-19 21:49:08 Getting us off fossil fuels would mean importing less oil from Russia.  So of course Putin has Trump doing the exact opposite?  With every decision this WH and Congress makes, you should be asking yourself “How does this benefit Putin?”

1112 2018-04-19 21:48:08 "More than 60% of population is below 30, a lot of them haven’t been to school & they are claiming that Nigeria is an oil producing country, therefore, they should sit & do nothing & get housing, healthcare, education free” - Buhari before world leaders
1113 2018-04-19 21:47:59 I clicked on it.
1114 2018-04-19 21:47:57 No central bank affiliates and their own oil. Much to hate there.
1115 2018-04-19 21:47:43 Who needs a thermometer when coconut oil works just as well. You know it’s hot when it’s turnt liquid.
1116 2018-04-19 21:47:42 im trying to thank you but my phone has slipped from my horribly greasy hands into a deep fat fryer, which ironically is less full of oil than my own body
1117 2018-04-19 21:47:34 Not sure about the get drunk part (though she’ll...stay hydrated ), but my sis sure fits that bill *wink*
1118 2018-04-19 21:47:30 Not sure the alternative is any better. Jason Kenney seems like a poor man's Harper. He might fight for big oil but he'll screw the middle class like they all do.
1119 2018-04-19 21:47:29 Even if there are other countries outside of international agreements and not committing to reductions, like Saudi Arabia, the developed world who buys that oil will quickly price their own consumers instead. In fact, they pretty much are.
1120 2018-04-19 21:47:16 Chili oil. Seriously, next time you make air fryer fries... dip them in chili oil.
1121 2018-04-19 21:47:13 Yep. Republicans gotta make more money off their oil and gas lobbyists.  Squeeze us dry. 
1122 2018-04-19 21:47:13 Chef McElroy cut up some carrots, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a blue stop sign, along with hot sauce.
1123 2018-04-19 21:47:10 I almost had one too. Turns out I just needed an oil change. Just take your car to the dealership, they’ll give you an oil change for a good price.
1124 2018-04-19 21:47:04 This is snake oil. In fact, I publicly challenge Mr Ethical to tell me how a 1% s/holder in HSBC (Capital Gp) might exercise material control over HSBC’s corp. actions in a way that cld. reasonably be called ‘corrupt’. He is barking at the moon.
1125 2018-04-19 21:47:01 Bad for beer. Good for oil. 



I guess I’ll take that as a win. 
#toughcall
1126 2018-04-19 21:46:40 Let me get this oil change
1127 2018-04-19 21:46:35 I came to do a oil change and i been here since 3. 
1128 2018-04-19 21:46:34 And suffering due to the volumn of boats in the area.  This is the worst kind of oil to spill into the ocean, it will sink and cause irreparable damage.
1129 2018-04-19 21:46:28 I think it’s so funny to see my mom complaining abt gas being like 2.70 a gallon bc I remember when it was like 4 bc of the oil spill a few years ago
1130 2018-04-19 21:46:14 A tip from one Oil Boy to another: every time you wash your hands, rinse your face
1131 2018-04-19 21:46:01 I. Am. The. One.
1132 2018-04-19 21:45:41 You might, and possibly rightly, argue that reduce our oil extraction isn't the most cost-effective way of meeting our obligations, but you'd either have to pick something else (agriculture?) or, my preference, back a massive increase in carbon prices.
1133 2018-04-19 21:45:40 A drop of pure and natural extra virgin olive oil is an amazing moisturizer for your skin and won’t clog pores!
1134 2018-04-19 21:45:37 The heat melted my coconut oil and I just accidentally spilt it all over my clean bed sheets im going to CRY
1135 2018-04-19 21:45:32 Talk about "sitting down" to eat "free" food because we are an "oil" producing country to England.

1136 2018-04-19 21:45:28 Progress. 48" x 36" oil on birch panel.
1137 2018-04-19 21:45:21 What do expect from this longtime supporter of oil pipelines who stood by & watched the atrocities at #StandingRock. ??
1138 2018-04-19 21:44:43 Nice wheels.
1139 2018-04-19 21:44:41 @dougemblidge @ginnyryan better oil her wig......it's drying out. My horse's stall has better looking straw
1140 2018-04-19 21:44:38 He's also deeper in the pocket of big oil than Tillerson was.
1141 2018-04-19 21:44:36 Mine is flowering like that right now. Almost all year round, I make a room spray from steeping cold-rinsed twiggy leaves in boiling water and leaving overnight, then adding drops of essential oil of lavender.
1142 2018-04-19 21:44:30 So, to meet those commitments, when other countries increase production or consumption of oil they must find redutions elsewhere (eg increasing productivity or decreasing production or consumption of other things)
1143 2018-04-19 21:44:22 Saw that coming Trump liking the pockets of his Oil buddies
1144 2018-04-19 21:44:06 Is this more durable than your Tung oil?
1145 2018-04-19 21:44:05 @ginnyryan better oil her wig......it's drying out. My horse's stall has better looking straw
1146 2018-04-19 21:44:04 Hey maybe the Democrats could, you know, BACK HIM UP instead of doing the bidding of corporations, big oil and the pharmaceutical industry.
1147 2018-04-19 21:44:01 Pemex Ceo Says Oil Production Currently At 1.9 Mln Bpd And Will Hit 1.97 Mln Bpd At The End Of The Year
1148 2018-04-19 21:43:54 You guys just won’t stop hey? OPEC. just announced they want oil prices higher, possibly the $100 mark. Oil trading up significantly overnight and today...
1149 2018-04-19 21:43:52 Coconut oil is screeching at you to use it sis
1150 2018-04-19 21:43:50 For those of us who did use of English in our 1st degree will understand PMB's statement was referring to youths who haven't gone to school or make any effort but sit down at home expecting freebies cuz they are from oil producing nation and the word "lazy youth " was never use

1152 2018-04-19 21:43:34 Beg to differ. Sometimes would be more accurate. Like drilling oil or building cars? Sure.

Done a crap job w/ health insurance, & pretty sure I don't want to spin off military or intelligence to mercenary concerns.

Finally, not everything is better when it has a profit motive.
1153 2018-04-19 21:43:19 Steinhoff is brain dead. $MFRM is a middle man. They bought these snake oil pushers for a huge premium. Unless $MFRM owns their locations, with little debt, Steinhoff will be sorry.
1154 2018-04-19 21:43:17 It feels great when the dealership recommends a new battery at a previous oil change because ita super low (it wasn’t) but at your future oil change never recommends again. /s

Do you know hw many graduates are on Uber and Taxify as drivers! Yet we are lazy! Can u explain d source of money your son used to acquire d power bike if not oil money. U need no explanation. If there is education in Nigeria, why did your kids studied abroad
1157 2018-04-19 21:42:58 PEMEX CEO SAYS OIL PRODUCTION CURRENTLY AT 1.9 MLN BPD AND WILL HIT 1.97 MLN BPD AT THE END OF THE YEAR: RTRS. #OOTT
1158 2018-04-19 21:42:57 Erm I beg to differ, UK gov will always follow the money....funny how regime change is only required in oil rich states, Sudan not so much
1159 2018-04-19 21:42:47 I marinade chicken in garlic herb marinade, melt butter in a pan and add canola oil and coat the butter and oil with garlic herb seasoning then pit the Chicken on the pan to fry add some mushrooms, add Alfredo Sauce and White Whine and boil Spaghetti Noodles
1160 2018-04-19 21:42:39 He's announcing @abstractdatabiz beard oil and chili sauce. 

Probably. I wouldn't know.
1161 2018-04-19 21:42:35 Lol I was sitting here getting an oil change n the guy that sold it to me started talking to me n then showed me the new model 
1162 2018-04-19 21:42:33 Cole + trash = water and oil
1163 2018-04-19 21:42:30 This outcome is true OF ALL MARKETS, so if you think this approach will be ineffectual in oil, it'll be ineffectual everywhere and you'll effectively be arguing to let the world burn.
1164 2018-04-19 21:42:27 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.
1165 2018-04-19 21:42:27 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1166 2018-04-19 21:42:24 It is, if you don’t use a priming oil with it. It’s super super dry.
1167 2018-04-19 21:42:18 The oil blotting papers save my lifeee lol

1169 2018-04-19 21:42:02 God bless the Donald! Saudi Arabia go 100 dollar oil in swimming in it
1170 2018-04-19 21:42:02 Pruitt must have done some off the books lobbying for some oil nation crook and he didn't deliver what he promised, now that crook is after him.
1171 2018-04-19 21:42:00 not to get super gross and detailed or anything but i get super gross zits full of slime and pus and oil in the stinky folds there
1172 2018-04-19 21:41:54 Soaked my hair in almond oil last night I feel like a goddess now

Mike Pompeo was #1 in his class at West Point...yeah yeah yeah... So what? You said Rex Tillerson would be great Sec of State because he was CEO of Exxon, #1 oil company in world  How did that work out?
1174 2018-04-19 21:41:48 A group of youths believe the proceeds of oil sales is their right. Agbero will stop your container and demand for pay before off loading and you say we aren't lazy?
1175 2018-04-19 21:41:43 Instead of having a “them vs us” attitude, ie labor, conservative, green peace. Why don’t we just work together, to make the country great! Fuck war. Oil is dead. Bring back community spirit. And renewable energy!! Rant over.
1176 2018-04-19 21:41:41 Am the Chairman of #LazyNigerianYouths... And please @Mbuhari my own share of Oil  for last month is yet to be receive. Make it quick. The work I do in a day if your son should try it he be in coma until the arrival of Jesus Christ.... #LazyNigerianYouths
1177 2018-04-19 21:41:39 Man it feels awesome when the dealership you bought your vehicle from at 50,000 recommends a fuel injection service during an oil change because I never had one done at 30,0000 /s
1178 2018-04-19 21:41:38 There used to be 3 of us stick shift boys at work but one of the guys ran his Honda out of oil and killed it so only 2 remain
1179 2018-04-19 21:41:32 Are you pulling your support for Keystone? Instead of shipping raw oil to Texas and buy it back at higher prices we can instead just refine it here?
1180 2018-04-19 21:41:28 I just started smoking weed again after only smoking cannabis oil for a few months and god damn
1181 2018-04-19 21:41:28 That is all they are doing. @NASA has some of the most accurate research on this issue, they are all greedy Oil and gas shills and Koch heads.... there in-lies the rub.
1182 2018-04-19 21:41:21 Burning midnight oil to understand what ‘life’ is!
1183 2018-04-19 21:40:57 Because I already paid them to gimme my oil change! Plus i didn’t even need one so eat my ass.
1184 2018-04-19 21:40:46 Butter and coconut oil
1185 2018-04-19 21:40:46 #A234 resembles colorless olive oil, that is.
1186 2018-04-19 21:40:43 Never realized how good squash tastes with just a lil olive oil, salt and pepper
1187 2018-04-19 21:40:33 I'm a woman who wants equal pay for equal work
I want to ensure people who want/provide abortions are safe
I want to ensure nurses, teachers, social workers, doctors, LPNs, etc are properly staffed/paid
I don't work in oil industry
I support GSAs
Is your tent big enough for me?

1193 2018-04-19 21:40:09 Oil is so fun but the turpentine smells soooooo strong make sure you have a fan
1194 2018-04-19 21:39:54 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other.

1213 2018-04-19 21:37:50 The #1 leading cause of what you state you are trying to protect and therefore your focus and all of your ilk SHOULD be on animal agriculture. But it's easier to blame "Big Bad Oil" as opposed to your neighbour at the grocery store buying hamburger.....sad...
1214 2018-04-19 21:37:48 Also, we're already being drawn into war by the Oil Cartel, Israel, and Globalist Banksters. They're pulling strings.
1215 2018-04-19 21:37:46 For soup, cook ground shallots in oil, then simmer with meatballs, cayenne, chicken broth and lemongrass. Top with basil.

1217 2018-04-19 21:37:30 does anyone else dress their salads with olive oil, vinegar and salt
1218 2018-04-19 21:37:19 Which one is the bank fraudster?

1230 2018-04-19 21:36:12 No, we need oil now while we transition to a fully electrified transport sector over 3 decades. Banning imports without transitioning is absurd. This is signalling the purpose of the transition, the future state, and signalling that we have to get on with it.
1231 2018-04-19 21:35:54 If we're being real it's too late to save the earth. Going green can't save us anymore. Stopping oil drilling won't make a fuck anymore. We're passed the point of no return and at this point all we can do is prolong the enevitable
1232 2018-04-19 21:35:52 I put lavender oil on my scalp last night (I'm gonna see if it'll help make my hair grow thick again), and I'm still smelling faint hints of lavender on my hair.
1233 2018-04-19 21:35:49 If you have a Mini Cooper S with a supercharger,  this is what happens when the supercharger's oil is never changed!
1234 2018-04-19 21:35:26 I can pump the gas and check the oil.. that’s it 
1235 2018-04-19 21:35:19 Maybe. But the truth is plastic will pretty much disappear from use in the next 20 years. And a good thing too before it totally chokes the oceans and the planet dies. 45 years until we run out of oil.
1236 2018-04-19 21:35:14 Oil Rumble? BEST THING EVER! (The nickname, not the event.)
1237 2018-04-19 21:35:10 Isn’t NASA the lynchpin to climate data? Isn’t this all a very deliberate scheme to gut climate change proof do oil companies and other climate destroying corporations can continue to churn out record profits?
1238 2018-04-19 21:35:08 #LazyNigerianYouths, He was talking about those that didn't go to school, he say More than 60% of the population is below the age of 30, *a lot of them haven't been go  to school* and they are claiming that Nigeria has been an oil producing company.
1239 2018-04-19 21:35:07 Somewhere that hasn't been leased to oil and gas interests.

1241 2018-04-19 21:35:01 How do I bid on the contract?
1242 2018-04-19 21:35:01 I like how you're quoting a guy who thinks diluted bitumen is oil and acting like he knows things about stuff. Sure, you fill your gas tank with diluted bitumen. See how far that gets you.
1243 2018-04-19 21:34:58 If I had 2 billion dollars I'd ... #ifihad2billiondollars @JustinTrudeau #StopKM Unplug from the oil industry! (and you'll win a lot of Canadians back, and change the voting method too!)

1245 2018-04-19 21:34:57 Dunno why I feel this Shell investment is questionable. Has the tenure of Oil well allocation expired? When are they likely to be allocated?

We must check our history books. Something similar happened with the LNG in the 70's/ 80's in connection with the Bishop of Canterbury.
1246 2018-04-19 21:34:56 I'm shirtless and covered in coconut oil at 76's cookout right now. Pass the bbq sauce

1251 2018-04-19 21:34:11 I don’t know where to go to get an oil change. For a reasonable price && not find other stuff wrong w my car bc that’s not what I’m going there for.
1252 2018-04-19 21:34:05 And immediately if K-E starts using Furnace Oil as per directive of NEPRA  !
You're a ROGUE MONOPOLY holding Karachiites hostage !
1253 2018-04-19 21:34:03 ? BC still consumes huge amounts of oil just like everywhere else. this does nothing to obstruct the actual industry. alternative is to import it from and fund countries that have nowhere near the same level of environmental conscientiousness
1254 2018-04-19 21:33:54 Of all the UK supermarkets, Asda's made-to-order pizza counter is by far and away the best. To make a Drewvelo: BBQ sauce base, standard cheese, hot and spicy chicken, chilli beef, chorizo, chilli cheese and chilli oil.
1255 2018-04-19 21:33:53 Saher says if you remove the oil and gas revenue from government finances, Alberta would have had a deficit every year since 1980. Time for Albertans to ask about how that “structural deficit” plays out over the next 35 years. #ableg

1257 2018-04-19 21:33:28 Can you kindly help me with the video where Mr. President said "Nigerian Youths are lazy, only want oil money?"

1270 2018-04-19 21:32:20 The marinade you use is important. Check out North American recipes. I used a mix of olive oil, chili powder and various herbs but some even soak the meat in Coca-Cola overnight!
1271 2018-04-19 21:32:09 I started using pure soap recently, yet to see the results, i have acne prone skin so coconut oil is out, will stick to argan oil.

1292 2018-04-19 21:30:02 Hey look into lawfirms (especially FL) that had every employee donate the max allowable to Hill. The lawfirms typically had one client -- big oil. I assumed it had to with everglades drilling. Retainers used to circumvent FEC laws?
1293 2018-04-19 21:29:56 I made some canola oil but it wasn’t as strong as I wanted it to be. I used like a half but I think I should have cooked it for longer

1297 2018-04-19 21:29:33 I've noticed sauce separate on pasta that has some sort of oil on it. It's usually the watery part of the sauce that won't stick and I often notice a pool of "tomato water" or "cheese water", as I call it, slowly collect in the plate.
1298 2018-04-19 21:29:30 as if coming to jiffy lube didn’t make me nervous enough, i think i have a crush on the man changing my oil....

1311 2018-04-19 21:28:13 I need to be getting up to get a oil change but im laid across the bed
1312 2018-04-19 21:28:12 It’s all smoke and mirrors. These were the prices were around when oil was $100 a barrel. We are now importing a finished product, as it’s cheaper. Yeah, right. Start refining our own oil, but no, more money selling it and buying it back.
1313 2018-04-19 21:28:07 @bellacrgz1 the loose powder and baby oil doesn’t work either :(

1318 2018-04-19 21:27:41 Maybe because you use baby oil instead of sunscreen
1319 2018-04-19 21:27:36 Same.  The ones I get don't have anywhere near that much oil and they taste amazing.
1320 2018-04-19 21:27:34 As a North Dakota born and raised, now MN resident I am so excited to perform in this show. Literally, all my mom wants to talk about is the oil patch.

1325 2018-04-19 21:26:27 But, as Markam identified, the translation of local intensity reductions to global emissions reductions depends on the what oil production ends up displaced by Canadian production.
1326 2018-04-19 21:26:23 He’d also be pleased to shut down Alberta’s oil industry ASAP.  Some leader, he’s a National embarrassment.
1327 2018-04-19 21:26:18 classically no
thin brush of olive oil. A drizzle of Pesto and some fresh Feta and finally a dusting of the finest chopped sausage you  have. And  you will probably not find that on the menu any were in North America.

1333 2018-04-19 21:25:45 We are talking about GHG remissions by reducing oilsands production but wouldn't it be more useful to separate the two? Why aren't we talking about reducing the emissions of production? Given that heavy oil creates more products & > value we will still need for many products.

1335 2018-04-19 21:25:38 role models are in Aso Rock enjoying free oil money without even solving any problem for the country.
Why would anyone disagree with you that the Nigerian youths are uneducated? It's very obvious.That's why they don't even know their rights. They keep defending your ineptitude.
1336 2018-04-19 21:25:35 @MBuhari said that we are relying on oil money, please when did they start sharing this oil money , they haven't given me my share oooooooooooooo.

1337 2018-04-19 21:25:32 And in any case deep sea oil exploration is unviable financially. The FT estimated cost of exploration and extraction at USD115 a barrel. That’s well above the selling price for oil, and there are already enormous proven reserves.
1338 2018-04-19 21:25:29 @ anyone and everyone who experiences cold sores: USE COCONUT OIL

1339 2018-04-19 21:25:20 If she really got 7 different cancers, whatever essential oil she’s using should be investigated as a carcinogen 
1340 2018-04-19 21:25:04 Republicans wanted so bad to export oil so Big Oil could make huge profits. Now we pay more for gas because our oil is going to other countries. Republicans and Trump always work hard for big money donors like Big Oil
1341 2018-04-19 21:25:03 This is an indirect & inquomputus response to a well made tweet, channeled towards calling incomvagress ladies to order.
Thumbs up to you sweetheart for such ingenuity. More oil to ur head honey.
1342 2018-04-19 21:24:57 Huge amounts of cologne or beard oil?
1343 2018-04-19 21:24:53 Nothing clean about coal. It is filthy. I lived In a place that used coal to heat your homes until it was switched over to oil then natural gas. Even when the coal in the coal cards are wet you still get some dust residual.  Fossil fuels the think of the past. Be progressive.
1344 2018-04-19 21:24:47 Walahi!!...that Nigerian youth is fantastically kwruupt,can you imagine even though he is unemployed he managed to buy power bike of #80 million and because he is lazy and idle,always spending oil money he celebrated new year in the hospital!!

1359 2018-04-19 21:22:08 “Creating tremendous vast amounts of oil”....?? And even if true, how does that translate to ‘tough on Russia’?
(Btw Trump is not doing that, but he wants to with offshore drilling and opening up ANWR) 
1360 2018-04-19 21:22:00 The Dog decided he wanted to switch to haute cuisine and refused to eat his regular food, even refusing yogurt with pieces of pear and salmon oil. Instead he got all-day hunger and now even the ordinary kibble tastes like haute cuisine.

1367 2018-04-19 21:21:32 Interesting, I've seen the city and state lawsuits. They look like money grabs as some of those cities actively courted big oil in the past.
1368 2018-04-19 21:21:19 Thank you for this. 2/5 of the world’s fastest growing economies are in Africa. We have the largest reserves of precious metals, 30% of the Earth’s remaining mineral resources. Nigeria is one of the largest oil exporters in the world. There is so much good and so much potential

Yep, it’s true!

1383 2018-04-19 21:18:59 He say More than 60% of the population is below the age of 30, *a lot of them haven't been to school* and they are claiming that Nigeria has been an oil producing company therefore they should sit and do nothing and get housing, health care and education free.

Sir, I completely agree with you that the Nigerian youths are lazy and uneducated and always wanting free oil money. Their role models are in Aso
1385 2018-04-19 21:18:52 I ate a whole bag of Trader Joe’s Organic Popcorn with Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil in my bed and the proof is everywhere and I’m not sorry.
1386 2018-04-19 21:18:44 Did I say I was okay with oil?  We need to start to find a better resource that doesn't do so much destruction to our environment period.
1387 2018-04-19 21:18:40 Why? Because we're the only ones that give a shit about the environment and the ocean? Unrefined oil spills will be catastrophic and they will go from 1 tanker a month to 1 day, only a matter of time until it happens. But hey, money is more important than the planet
1388 2018-04-19 21:18:37 I gave it up because of the palm oil.

1408 2018-04-19 21:16:25 @Mbuhari you said that the Nigerian youths are uneducated and lazy. That the we want free money from the oil.
1409 2018-04-19 21:16:16 When I was searching for internship positions for my SIWES experience, I found no opportunity in big oil/mineral corporations, banks or public offices. NPA was a mistake.
Guess who employed me. A #HardWorkingNigerianYouth, Sokari Gillis-Harry @cybersokari. I'm glad I met him.

1412 2018-04-19 21:16:06 Exactly!

Recently I got some baklava from a local bakery, then read they have palm oil. Ate 'em then, but never again.
1413 2018-04-19 21:16:06 They combine it with a technology to produce solid carbon to be included for exemple in concrete or the CO2 can be used for enhanced oil and gas recovery in their Siberian fields, the only current CCS technology making economic sense.

1415 2018-04-19 21:16:03 Now @PnPCBC, if you think Albertans are upset they might not be able to export their oil, how about Quebeckers now upset they might not be able to export their beer? And was PMJT right to punish his MP for voting his conscience?

This year, China (worlds largest consumer of oil) will require producers to transact in Yuan contracts.
1422 2018-04-19 21:15:26 #LazyNigerianYouths so tomorrow our beloveth @MBuhari will go to U.K or USA to borrow huge amount of money to reform our educational system for Nigerian lazy illiterate youth that doesn't want to be educated because of oil. #ThereIsGod oh!

1450 2018-04-19 21:12:42 Good to see some push back.  The oil industry benefits so many across this country yet the left wants to kill it.  Then they support buying oil from dictators st a higher price & these countries do not have any regulations nor human rights...I hope other donors do the same.

1472 2018-04-19 21:10:19 The Nigerian youth have every right to demand for free healthcare, housing & education from oil wealth. That's why we vote PMB to help reduce our burden and extend our life expectancy. BH is fueled due to the none existence of the social indices

1479 2018-04-19 21:09:28 when you're an oil king and you make $100mil in a single year, you walk into an office and ask if the staff own any of the paintings in here
1480 2018-04-19 21:09:19 Fracking helped lower prices.  Oil prices overall (ie through Saudi Arabia) were then artificially dropped below what wildcatting frackers could maintain.  Many shut down; many purchased by big oil 2 stay shut or sell hi. History: big beer did the same w local breweries yrs ago.

1486 2018-04-19 21:08:38 Does this tweet suggest that, in fact, the US Capitol isn't bought by the NRA, but instead is owned by business, medical, oil, comms, and defense?

1525 2018-04-19 21:05:57 When asked re Peak Oil Demand, IEA’s Fatih Birol: “this is one of my favorite topics.” Passenger cats only account for 25% global oil demand. Just 4 countries have trucking efficiency standards v 50 for cars.  Truck standards may slow demand growth. @ColumbiaUEnergy #CGEPevents

1531 2018-04-19 21:04:52 Also you've got to assume the market's dumber than you to fall for that stunt. I wouldn't make that bet, personally. My advice to MbS is keep price moderate. Maximize total sales $. You are in a race with time & technology. 30 yrs from now oil won't be worth cost of drilling it.
1532 2018-04-19 21:04:42 Interesting that the President mentioned OIL in his verbal assault on Nigerian youth.

Can anyone tell the President that his generation became EXTREMELY LAZY & have continually proven to be UNIMAGINATIVE because of oil?

#LazyNigerianYouths.
1533 2018-04-19 21:04:36 @MBuhari I'm lazy! Oh no youths are the reason why this country is still surviving,who extracts crude oil?,who does agricultural work and other relevant works?Youths keep this country alive while you old fools in the uniform of politicians take advantage of our sweat

1541 2018-04-19 21:03:46 I love this, my skin already feels and looks so much better, is it ok to use peptide 4 night recovery cream oil under it please and is it ok to use pro collagen super serum elixer under total glow tanning moisturiser please, sorry its a long question, Love Love Elemis
1542 2018-04-19 21:03:45 I ain’t got a leave in conditioner but I got three hair products I tend to use, a softener, an oil, and a wax/cream to make sure it keeps its “structure.”
1543 2018-04-19 21:03:44 Seems like there would be issues such as oil and other fluids on the canopy, scratches from gravel or tyre marbles, and issues with the canopy fogging up

1549 2018-04-19 21:03:00 I thank my lucky stars I found out about CBD oil for my cronic pain with arthritis. I was able to stop taking the painkillers every four hours before addiction kicked in. The side effects were horrendous yet I was still in pain. I feel normal again and so very glad 
1550 2018-04-19 21:02:58 I won't be angry if @MBuhari said we wait for football money from Bet9ja.. What is oil money please? We are not #LazyNigerianYouths
1551 2018-04-19 21:02:57 I've heard of high carb low fat, and I've heard of low carb high fat, but what about high carb high fat? Because that's a diet I could really get behind *dips potato wedge into a massive puddle of olive oil*
1552 2018-04-19 21:02:55 Fatih: Putting fuel efficiency standards for trucks would definitely slow down the rise in oil consumption due to trucks as only 4 countries have such standards for trucks but all countries have them for cars #cgepevents
1553 2018-04-19 21:02:50 That is awesome Damien ,keep educating everyone on the benefits of Cbd oil..Congrats..

1556 2018-04-19 21:02:26 What I am wondering is, if provinces can limit import of beer and wine from other provinces, does that also mean that oil exports can be limited. B/c if BC won't let energy go thru, maybe energy shouldn't go in either.
1557 2018-04-19 21:02:26 I was getting a much-needed oil change at the Firestone on Grand Avenue before work, so I didn't have time to grab lunch. So here's my theme song for the night.

1563 2018-04-19 21:01:10 Is that the reason why he insulted Nigerian youths. i kno our youths are resourceful only his children are lazzy because they only depend and get more than they needed from our oil money. God is watching and i know he fears no one

1566 2018-04-19 21:00:56 once you make the pilgrimage to The Great Oil Pit. You must offer up a part as sacrifice, after which a new road will open up to you leading to the The Station Of Eternal Gasoline.  The pump gnomes use stilts and not only fill the tank but check the oil and wash the windows.
1567 2018-04-19 21:00:54 The comment of PMB concerning Nigerian youth is not an insult but a wake-up call to ensure that most youths that believed that oil money is the ultimate should not do so instead focus on something else like agriculture, mining, trading thereby becoming self employed.
1568 2018-04-19 21:00:50 Mine only has, flour, salt, sugar, yeast, water, tsp oil. 6... make your own....

1575 2018-04-19 21:00:12 Try this for confidence, Darren: When driving along and you see a truck/van benching black smoke, give the driver a gentle toot, motion to roll the window down, then tell them they're burning oil. My dad said that's what the black smoke was. It's how I get my mechanical jollies.
1576 2018-04-19 21:00:08 Coconut oil is very healthy. It is high in special fats called medium chain triglycerides, which are metabolized differently than other fats
1577 2018-04-19 21:00:07 I am no oil expert but when Gartman made that foolish statement I knew he would be proven wrong simply because oil producing nations with a heavy reliance on those revenues would not allow such a low price indefinately!

1586 2018-04-19 20:59:00 I second this!! I just use the pure virgin coconut oil, the stuff you can also cook with, can get it very cheap in Lidl 
1587 2018-04-19 20:58:52 I love their foundation and it’s way cheaper than any other one I’ve used but has the same quality! I mix it with some maracuja oil to make it spread more evenly though
1588 2018-04-19 20:58:29 My hair is so healthy and thick, I’ve had customers coming up to me asking me what I use. I like castor oil and fresh rosemary!

1592 2018-04-19 20:57:57 Well oil price has been trending up since bottoming in 2016. But US oil production from shale fracking has started ramping up again too. So you can keep increasing the oil price until you can't. If you just want a price spike to maximise your Aramco float price that's OK.

1599 2018-04-19 20:57:22 The more u try to defend or define his words the more stupid both of you sound..the president is representing each and every Nigerian meaning his work is to paint each BD every Nigerian in glorious light.. he is d lazy one that didn't go to school nd has been enjoying oil money

1603 2018-04-19 20:56:48 Response from my source: He wants me to wait 24 hours for his HO to give him Ok to release most current Asian heavy crude oil refining capacity. What I can say is that it has increased substantially over the 2013 UofC study's numbers. This is why we talk to experts...shees.
1604 2018-04-19 20:56:26 Reno is one of the youth that PMB characterized as lazy one waiting to reap oil money from blackmail and gossip in media.

1607 2018-04-19 20:56:02 @armstrongcbc Why is it that I never hear any commentators mention Alberta refining capacity? Canada's foreign oil companies don't want to invest in Canadian refineries, and why should they? No Canadian politicians are putting any pressure on them. #cdnpoli
1608 2018-04-19 20:55:54 Falsies? The lashes? Oh yeah, they help. Also, being chubby stretches out the wrinkles so I look younger. Hair dye (I’ve been a redhead for ten years), Oil of Olay moisturizer every day, and a really great filter on your phone. Mostly it’s just the filter.

1632 2018-04-19 20:53:08 Reminds me of the flat top method at an old burger hangout.  Onions, oil & water and dome them to steam.  Them had page sized burger press on onions. As they browned, lift press, flip them and put press back on.  Great results. Always had multiple batches of onions going.
1633 2018-04-19 20:52:50 says a british labour trougher who kept her constituents poor at the height of a scottish oil boom to benefit herself and her odious party. That is not childish, it is bloody evil.
1634 2018-04-19 20:52:38 He spent 160 days in London hospital for free on thesame oil money, why must I be the bad person to demand for a free healthcare.

1636 2018-04-19 20:52:30 Portuguese olive oil is underrated, Italian overrated.
1637 2018-04-19 20:52:17 Considering the current price of oil floating at $80 a barrel, plus a weak pound.. the  inflation figure based on flows into the wider economic activity from the last 6 to 9 months, not whats happening today.

Added benefit is that it is absorbed though the skin and many people are magnesium deficient so you get your mag.
1641 2018-04-19 20:51:54 There’s no oil
1642 2018-04-19 20:51:49 Kai otondo keep quiet...
1643 2018-04-19 20:51:48 We think we are close to an oil top here. The global oil market rebalancing story has largely played out. The next leg up for oil, and commodities more generally, will be driven by a dollar breakdown, which is not yet on the horizon.
1644 2018-04-19 20:51:32 But the President said we’re producing record amounts of oil so what gives?
1645 2018-04-19 20:51:22 Congrats!!!!!

1648 2018-04-19 20:50:59 Are you adding the Oil from insects to existing dog food or do you have a totally new dog food to reveal?
1649 2018-04-19 20:50:52 McCabe should be boiled in oil! Because of his actions we have @realDonaldTrump and President Hannity lining the pockets of the wealthy worldwide!
1650 2018-04-19 20:50:45 Sorry. I worked in Oil & Gas for almost two decades. It's a sickness. Ask me about rigs and platforms.
1651 2018-04-19 20:50:43 It's stupid easy man. Chop onions, put in pot with olive oil, stir for a bit, add tomato paste, add wine, wait a bit, add beef stock, let it simmer for an hour. Come watch tonight.

1654 2018-04-19 20:50:26 Ok but applying an oil and a body moisturizer after it feels so good.
1655 2018-04-19 20:50:21 I can't believe the runup in price yesterday is attributed to KSA wanting "$100 oil". How gullible are traders?
1656 2018-04-19 20:50:19 Props.
1657 2018-04-19 20:50:16 @JustinTrudeau Straws don't need to be banned just made of a biodegradable product. Anything that is made of plastic can also be made of biodegradable hemp oil.

1663 2018-04-19 20:49:39 I really hate putting gas in my car, getting my oil changed on my car, shit I really hate spending any type of money on my car. 
1664 2018-04-19 20:49:38 If only our president weren't a smooth talking, snake oil salesman, with a broken moral compass.  I think it's OK at this point to let others more qualified carry on.
1665 2018-04-19 20:49:37 Comman buy coconut oil

1668 2018-04-19 20:49:28 I take CBD oil twice a day and THC oil at night. It is medical marijuana. The THC has been the best for me.
1669 2018-04-19 20:49:27 Agree 110 percent, what also pisses me off is companies killing the environment.
Big oil 
fracking companies etc etc

Humans can b disguising , we literally choking ocean like with our plastic garbage!!!!
1670 2018-04-19 20:49:19 All that winning!!!!  America increases oil productions to all time high and charge you more.

1675 2018-04-19 20:48:58 Nak minta rm1k servis kereta. Dgn tukar breakpad yang dah haus. Tak cukup bayar engine oil tengah bulan
1676 2018-04-19 20:48:54 Seeing what buhari has to say concerning the youth, its safe to say our president needs rest. How can he be accusing the youth for what these old aged folks are actually doing? Looting our oil money
1677 2018-04-19 20:48:51 I think @MBuhari was referring to SS ppl like d avengers, MEND etc who just sit and wait for oil money.
1678 2018-04-19 20:48:48 All these rich boy talk. You're one of the lazy Nigerians spending oil money the president talked about
1679 2018-04-19 20:48:47 Iraq 2003 was the right thing to do oil for the wealthy not the poor
1680 2018-04-19 20:48:40 In a quest for profits for fossil fuels, the oil industry will push their consumers to electric cars and solar power. Short sided thinking
1681 2018-04-19 20:48:33 Ok I’ll have the oil ready
1682 2018-04-19 20:48:31 90% of Nigeria youth truly want to get to the top position and also take their share of the oil money, I have had discussion with many.
All been said, I didn't like the fact that he said that on international duty, but nothing he said is a lie.
1683 2018-04-19 20:48:30 @RepJBridenstine So, like everyone else Trump has installed, I imagine you'll be spending your time hollowing out NASA, and denying science. After all, why try to inform and protect the planet when an oil company might lose money. Self-respect should have dissuaded you from this.
1684 2018-04-19 20:48:26 This is crazy. People are going to go mad for bee oil. If I were you I'd take a sabbatical, go to California, pitch your bee oil products unicorn to Silicon Valley and watch the money roll in. I'm serious! Then you can study your bees in biz.
1685 2018-04-19 20:48:09 Because the Gas companies can do whatever they want. Gas is now more than it was when Oil was $1.10 a barrel. I guess some gas executives need a new island 
1686 2018-04-19 20:48:04 @BANGONtrader 
Hey Buddy, any chance of one of your charts for #RKH Rockhopper please. I'm keen on this one with oil rising

1689 2018-04-19 20:47:42 Freeney will have a formal press conference to announce his retirement w/ Colts on Monday.

He's a Ring of Honor guy, and will see No. 93 up in Lucas Oil Stadium in a few short years. 98 should be next to him.
1690 2018-04-19 20:47:42 The market is down on oil related to fracking. It hits them all hard.
1691 2018-04-19 20:47:40 How did we go from drowning in oil to having to sell strategic reserves in like 3 seconds?
1692 2018-04-19 20:47:05 However is said they don't want to work because Nigeria is a oil producing state. As if the government has provided one.
1693 2018-04-19 20:46:52 Hell rules because you can do whatever you want there! Go to hell! Kill people! Burn shit! Fuck school! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
1694 2018-04-19 20:46:49 The American Lung Association released its annual State of the Air Report.
 "La Plata County in CO received an “F” grade due to high levels of ozone. ..less that 60,000 people in area, but is home to significant amounts of oil and gas production." @RepTipton @RepDMB @HanlonforCO
1695 2018-04-19 20:46:40 Why are Republicans so protective of the Trump Regime? Putin and Exxon's drilling for oil in the arctic circle, worth 9 trillion $
1696 2018-04-19 20:46:38 "A lot of Nigerians under the age of 30 haven't been to school, and are claiming that they should be idle and enjoy amenities for free because Nigeria produces oil."

Wetin come be my own?
1697 2018-04-19 20:46:30 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.
1698 2018-04-19 20:46:29 I treated myself tonight with buttery sweet potato mash and a whole baked garlic with olive oil and coarse salt. That's all, thank you for listening.

1706 2018-04-19 20:45:54 coconut oil is LIFE!
1707 2018-04-19 20:45:36 Connswater one is stinking. It's basically pressure fried so the oil is forced in. It's rank.
1708 2018-04-19 20:45:31 Plus the tax cuts are permanent for the wealthy and for ALL corporations whereas the rest of us have the tax cut rescinded in I think it's 5-7 years.  

And--Congress just opened up the Alaska Wildlife Refuge to oil companies in order to PAY for their wealthy-tax cuts. Crap!
1709 2018-04-19 20:45:30 Oil stocks $APC, $APA, $PXD to name a few. Also $XLE is a good ETF but its closely tied to $XOM, and $CVX
1710 2018-04-19 20:45:28 Actually, that's correct. There is unlikely to be a net reduction of emissions from the oil sands. FTR, I've never claimed there would be. My focus has been on carbon-intensity of oil sands crude, not total emissions. Take a bow, you're correct, sir. ;0)
1711 2018-04-19 20:45:21 Check your Engine oil this afternoon.
1712 2018-04-19 20:45:21 When you go to sears expecting to pay for a 20$ oil change and then your car breaks down in the auto center parking lot and you end up having to pay 200$ 
1713 2018-04-19 20:45:18 And I read this morning that SA has them in a box on oil.
1714 2018-04-19 20:45:08 I’m leaving coconut oil in my hair over night and the likely hood is that I definitely won’t be washing it out before school run! 
1715 2018-04-19 20:44:47 I definitely agree with that. I currently use their oil control primer with it, but I’ve done wear tests with Fenty, Wet n Wild, and Milani primers. The best results came with the NARS primer.
1716 2018-04-19 20:44:42 Absolutely not. They do not represent interests of the common people, they represent interests of transnational corporations, oil and military complex and bankers. They poison us with GMO/chemicals, drag us into wars and make basic necessities unaffordable.
1717 2018-04-19 20:44:39 oh oh what is big oil going to do with all the cheap leftovers from making gas?
1718 2018-04-19 20:44:38 Here's to all the midnight oil burners, the coffee makers and the deadline beaters.  
1719 2018-04-19 20:44:28 It comes with oil back rubbed n a manicure  I guess it’s worth it
1720 2018-04-19 20:44:20 I'm quoting the booth team here:  "We don't sell snake oil, sir, that's what everybody else here sells.  We're selling FAKE oil, and it handles all your security needs!"

1729 2018-04-19 20:42:53 Haha, I'll be honest, I always do this with other pasta sauces but didn't realise this was the case with a pesto and would just add some olive oil. Lesson learned as that was delicious!
1730 2018-04-19 20:42:51 Chris and I ordered from this Chinese that gave us really dry noodles. Should my review be "the noodles were dry, this can be fixed by 1) cooking the noodles in oil 2) add soy sauce 3) add msg 4) add Singapore sauce"
1731 2018-04-19 20:42:38 .@ColoradoOilGas opposes #HB1157 bill that tweaks & improves reporting of oil and gas accidents in Colorado. Accident report form is essentially a blank document and with dozens of accidents and explosions happening annually, we need more information. #COleg #copolitics

1741 2018-04-19 20:41:15 A great father with 10 youths and has only two of them looking at his "oil money" won't go to their neighbors house to disparage those two talk less a father that hasn't been responsible to the youths

1744 2018-04-19 20:41:04 Robbi, try tea tree essential oil. I'm not going to tell you that it won't sting, but it should dry it up.
1745 2018-04-19 20:41:02 If I had known it would take @pepboysauto over 3 hours with an appointment to change my oil and brakes I would’ve brought snacks and a pillow

1748 2018-04-19 20:40:41 PSA: Stop overpaying for basic oil changes! (Unless your car is newer and still under warranty) Have your local car dudes help you out or do it for you. WAY cheaper. 
1749 2018-04-19 20:40:35 US subsidies Tesla $465 Million. Oil and gas industry $37 Billion. Tesla is trying to save the planet.

1759 2018-04-19 20:39:21 Sheffield: in a vertical well the gas oil ration is 2500/1, but with horizontal wells the reservoir is depleting much faster and production is sped up. the gas oil ratio increased significantly but the oil is unaffected by this ratio. #cgepevents
1760 2018-04-19 20:39:20 Yes i like oil of Olay products!!
1761 2018-04-19 20:39:13 Which oil money is President Muhammadu Buhari talking about? @Bet9jaOfficial empower more youths than the Government
1762 2018-04-19 20:39:07 Wow! I had no idea. And in the south Port Harcourt's oil corrupts society.  What chance does peace have?
1763 2018-04-19 20:39:01 One of them slicked his fingers in oil and shoved them up Alvo’s ass.
1764 2018-04-19 20:38:47 The genie is out of the bottle, the struggle in Syria is about oil, very high placed people, formally from high places in the US government, are wanting to steal the oil discovered on the Golan Heights, The only way they can succeed , Is to kill or replace The President of Syria.
1765 2018-04-19 20:38:40 I love chilli oil on salad to spice it up as a dressing rather than mayo, or you can Mic the two for a creamy salad dressing x
1766 2018-04-19 20:38:35 The other Wall St Scam, when economy dies better price of oil & gas go up. Oil should not be subjected to Speculation!! The price should always b stable ensuring prosperity for condumers & oil companies who would still make a fortune..
1767 2018-04-19 20:38:28 Conveniently not mentioning that NAFTA requires that Canada supply the states with oil.  Not sure if it is a fixed amount or a percentage of what is produced.
1768 2018-04-19 20:38:28 “More than 60 percent of that population is below 30, a lot of them haven’t been to school and THEY ARE CLAIMING that Nigeria is an oil producing country and therefore, they should sit down, do nothing and get housing, healthcare, and education for free".  ~ Buhari.
Read youths!
1769 2018-04-19 20:38:27 So far your nominees have been doing a shitty job. But that's by design, isn't it #Trump . Gut the agencies. Tap all the oil and export the excess rather than stockpiling it for our National Security. And make us an isolationist Nation so we don't get in Putin's way.
1770 2018-04-19 20:38:26 Just oil??
1771 2018-04-19 20:38:21 Does it? I also like oil of olay for sensitive skin

1773 2018-04-19 20:37:57 This dude is such a clown. If he truly believed that, why not present a genuine offer and put 33% on the table??? The fixed purse is idiotic for a fight of this magnitude. Hearn is nothing more than a snake oil salesman.

1776 2018-04-19 20:37:34 Are you okay with human rights violations and lack of equality in oil producing counties that don't observe environmental rules?  What about our obligation to end poverty for children & women in other countries, to help make the world a better place for everyone who lives in it?

1792 2018-04-19 20:36:02 @AndrewBellBNN Why is it that Canada has had a 50 year old industrial policy of developing the Alberta oil sands yet no one ever considered how we would transport the oil to foreign markets until now? Where was Suncor?
1793 2018-04-19 20:35:43 Seems its like moving to ban manufacturing chocolate to tackle obesity but still letting it be imported.

1799 2018-04-19 20:35:01 Exactly @DrJenGunter. Drugs must undergo testing to be approved for use in  - so why are untested drugs available by prescription?  What changed everything and promoted proper testing? Thalidomide. So, drug companies undergo rigorous testing but snake oil is still available.

1. Your comment, “how ignorant do you have to be..” was condescending. My comment wishing the OP best of luck and giving some sound suggestions based on experience with a similar problem is not.

2. CBD oil, an anti-tumor diet, etc is not homeopathy.

1810 2018-04-19 20:33:57 Suspicion also falls on Israeli involvement now. They have already illegally secured the oil rich Golan heights for the western oil companies-mainly American and may need a buffer zone to protect them. Its an Imperialist pattern emerging once again!!

1907 2018-04-19 20:21:40 *getting my oil changed*

“Ooooo a Honda. Wait no, a hundee.”

Hyundai. It’s a Hyundai.
1908 2018-04-19 20:21:35 Lol Loko Oil Kumpul loi0iloLl0
1909 2018-04-19 20:21:30 nut oil = boneless fetus juice
1910 2018-04-19 20:21:30 I can’t wait to bust out my shimmering body oil on the weekends this summer and show the world my melanin goodness glow 
1911 2018-04-19 20:20:56 Beds are burning - Midnight oil - an Australian classic.
1912 2018-04-19 20:20:28 I find it disingenuous to suggest that the Suzuki foundation, a charity, should have donated to other charities like oil companies did.
1913 2018-04-19 20:20:27 Got a oil change 2 weeks ago and my engine oil light came on yesterday for a odd reason. Turns out whoever did my oil change left the cap off and now oil is all over my engine 
1914 2018-04-19 20:20:20 My day has consisted of me spending over $700 on new tires, alignments, oil change & rotations  #fffffffrrrriick
1915 2018-04-19 20:20:18 Sheffield: the trajectories of other countries in terms of oil prices points towards $50/60 oil prices.#cgepevents
1916 2018-04-19 20:20:17 So why start with "Has Vale softened his stance"? Even tho he says "I confirm all my words" Perhaps to the media vultures that were hoping for more oil thrown on the fire it indeed is soft. omg move on alrdy
1917 2018-04-19 20:19:41 I mean big oil gets trillion in subsidies because the government is totally trustworthy with the environment
1918 2018-04-19 20:19:37 Slowing growth as oil rises taking a big bite out of consumers pockets! Seeing stocks flailing in what is suppose to be a bang up earning's season.
1919 2018-04-19 20:19:32 so are we wasting our time taking high concentrated fish oil.  No t clear
1920 2018-04-19 20:19:27 *pours tea tree oil on entire life*
1921 2018-04-19 20:19:18 Low income growth, retailers collapsing each week due to plummeting sales on the high Street, increasing oil prices, inflation on its way down - where is the incentive to raise rates and reduce disposable incomes further?

1923 2018-04-19 20:18:57 I put castor oil in my beard and I’m telling you I felt magical after.
1924 2018-04-19 20:18:57 My apple oil finally came in today!! Can't wait to finally make the apple+vanilla scent!
1925 2018-04-19 20:18:51 Whoa!!! Did President Trump stifle news media?
Keystone pipeline BIG oil spill.
1926 2018-04-19 20:18:47 So this could very possibly mean that our fearless, hardworking, burn the midnight oil Citizen Journalist and all around BRILLIANT gal, Ms. Tracy Beanz, is correct in her suspicions about Cohen/Sater! 
1927 2018-04-19 20:18:45 Change the oil in your car, pour it in the yard. Have a smoke.
1928 2018-04-19 20:18:41 The batteries were the number #1 hurdle. Notice I put a period between that and my next two points. Tesla is trying to reinvent what Detroit perfected a long time ago. I don’t see it, auto/oil is too powerful
1929 2018-04-19 20:18:41 What will be the effect of higher oil prices on automobile sector? Dan: there is a lot more uncertainty, many futures are possible and it depends on how the automobile market changes and I believe there will be many gasoline vehicles #cgepevents
1930 2018-04-19 20:18:34 Their sushi love roll slathered in olive oil slithered into their rectum
1931 2018-04-19 20:18:16 I just wish I could work in the oil field af. I can't wait until all this is over 
1932 2018-04-19 20:18:07 My dudeeee , the guy who’s changing my oil is WOW
1933 2018-04-19 20:18:07 Been at sea all my working life Gary.....ex commercial fishing skipper.....then offshore construction oil and gas ......renewable energy projects. .....mainly construction ships and barges etc etc.....in the blood 
1934 2018-04-19 20:18:04 He didn't call me lazy bcos I'm not part of the youths he described. I'm the CEO of my small fashion brand and I don't believe we have any oil that should make me demand for free education and healthcare services. So by default he's not targeting me.
1935 2018-04-19 20:18:00 I think vape user should wear an item that resembles a large fish bowl over their heads to keep in the released oil residue.
1936 2018-04-19 20:17:51 Yesterday I did some hash oil with my runt Arob the hop-Sniffer.
1937 2018-04-19 20:17:51 I bought a oil painting of the Musbury Tor here about 10 years ago. It still hangs in my bedroom. Grey skies and moorland - perfectly encapsulates my time in Rossendale. Love it 
1938 2018-04-19 20:17:48 He can say  what ever he likes because if we were so educated how will we vote him to power. Even be hailing "say baba" . if we were so hard working why didn't we work his way out of sit when he traveled 4  months spending oil money in d name of sickness
1939 2018-04-19 20:17:36  Crude Oil Prices

1940 2018-04-19 20:16:57 ...unarmed & unloaded...
1941 2018-04-19 20:16:46 Oil leak, need some seals.
1942 2018-04-19 20:16:44 Oh, and we didn’t cause the oil and gas market to crash my dear. Not one bit, but sure, blame the WORLD-WIDE oil bust on Alberta alone. Seems fitting. You from Ontario or BC?
1943 2018-04-19 20:16:44 US Closing prices: #DOW -0.34% #NASDAQ -0.85% #Ftse100 0.16% #GBPUSD 1.4091 #EURGBP 0.8761 #EURUSD 1.2346 #Gold -0.01% #Oil -0.19%
1944 2018-04-19 20:16:30 Oil companies are also investing in other forms of energy, not necessarily oil. Let's see the fine print first.
1945 2018-04-19 20:16:26 I need to take my car to get an oil change
1946 2018-04-19 20:16:25 6-8pm...Chicken Oil Co. open mic.  @benkadmusic said he’s buying everyone’s beer.  If you’re not there you’re a rectangle.
1947 2018-04-19 20:16:24 Misinterpreting some how doesn't have a formal education in his life time...who enjoy oil free money? Buhari in his time..
1948 2018-04-19 20:16:14 SocGen said it saw a 70% chance of Iran sanctions snapping back into effect. This could remove up to 500k bpd of production and add $10 to the oil price, SG said, adding that $5 was already priced in. GS said the potential partial loss of Iranian oil could add $7 to price #oott
1949 2018-04-19 20:16:02 I'd cheerfully see Netanyahu boiled in oil, for sure. But I wouldn't want to say I "hate" him and his government. There is too much hate.
1950 2018-04-19 20:15:58 There’s a Taliah Waahjid oil i bought in Barbados for my braids that i cannot found out here and that whole brand is the Fucking goat. They had more of her products out there than i can find out here like wtf
1951 2018-04-19 20:15:55 Every time I go to @Honda just for my oil change there’s always some other shit I need where it’s gonna cost me an arm and leg 
1952 2018-04-19 20:15:52 If they do something that is harassment then some poisonous insect can kill them. Somebody can also spill the oil. Godly army
1953 2018-04-19 20:15:49 Can someone explain how the U.S is producing a record number of oil and yet gas prices are still spiking ridiculously high
1954 2018-04-19 20:15:14 Oh god i love them and miss them.
I know they have GF versions but they have palm oil in them. So i just eat mission figs plain.
1955 2018-04-19 20:15:12 Yup . One of the world's largest pension funds getting out of oil and gas Trudeau double downs on dirty pipelines. Wonder who knows more about financial risk and oil futures?
1956 2018-04-19 20:15:10 Congratulations Shea !
1957 2018-04-19 20:15:08 The shock was the collapse in oil gas prices in 2014-16 and the loss of Russia as an export market. Only paying customer now is China, but a lot of that cash goes to paying off debt for the construction of the pipeline to China. Govt refuses to dip in its fx in response to crisis
1958 2018-04-19 20:14:58 As I understand it they sloosh, diesel and or engine oil on the roads..Twats...
1959 2018-04-19 20:14:34 id love to try the chilli oil on my chicken salads for a twist on a healthy lunch!
1960 2018-04-19 20:14:32 Black seed oil will clear it up fast. You can google it. 
1961 2018-04-19 20:14:30 Yea I guess NG is cleaner than those examples but its still not the cleanest way to produce energy, which I think should be the goal. 

& also NG seems irrelevant to this convo cuz the KM pipeline is specifically designed to carry crude oil // dirty AB tar sands oil
1962 2018-04-19 20:14:28 I might be convinced they are destroying those guns if they put the whole destruction exercise on YouTube...
1963 2018-04-19 20:14:14 They gotta do something, right now the economics of shipping mean container ships run on burning heavy fuel oil, the filthiest energy source known to man
1964 2018-04-19 20:14:12 It took 3.5 hours for my oil change  and now it’s time for new tires! All this damn driving back and forth to LA killing me smalls.
1965 2018-04-19 20:13:49 Will Oil continue its run higher? $cl #crudeoil
1966 2018-04-19 20:13:44 @realDonaldTrump President thanks for all your are doing I have a question if we r now exporting oil which means we r importing less why can't we bring down our prices in the USA to help all Americans
1967 2018-04-19 20:13:39 Olive Branch? Please tell me any olive branch you are referring to.... He has been combative and divisive since even before his nomination. Please don't change history, Susan. Remember, he wants to "Drain the Swamp" but he's doing that with olive branches? Doesn't make sense!
1968 2018-04-19 20:13:27 I love adding a little chilli oil to humous, perfect for dipping veg and pitta bread in!
1969 2018-04-19 20:13:23 You did not discuss driving with her or me when I was in a month ago. I just knew better. You told her to get where she was going and then do it there. That was after she called twice. She was told to dilute it in coconut oil but you said she would need so much it would be $$$
1970 2018-04-19 20:13:04 International and interprovincial trade are fully within federal jurisdiction; transactions and their regulation within the province, Alberta in this case of oil/gas resource extraction, are provincial jurisdiction; #UNDRIP is a general statement with no standing in law.#bcpoli
1971 2018-04-19 20:12:59 Ooooh! Are they selling any Security Snek Oil?!
1972 2018-04-19 20:12:55 Why does every DeSmog piece about the oil sands, heavy oil markets, etc etc sound like it was written in 2013? My theory? Every writer, every "expert" is getting their information from Google. Happened last year when I debated Dr. Cornwall at VanPubLib. His source...Google.
1973 2018-04-19 20:12:29 i’m thankful for castor oil
1974 2018-04-19 20:12:10 Congratulations! So very happy for you.  Can't wait to see you at @roadamerica again this year!
1975 2018-04-19 20:12:05 The guys that say they demand women to know how to cook are the same ones that can’t change a tire/oil/ or pay any bills
1976 2018-04-19 20:11:56 Except Govts. low Crude Oil prices have not benefitted anybody. High Crude Oil Prices have always been happened with boom time and industrial growth phase.
1977 2018-04-19 20:11:48 Parity was usually enforced through displacement, sip rate-whatever.  Mercedes built a superior PU- hands down.  Now that everyone is burning oil for energy...- someone will have to properly explain how any of this is relevant to road cars.
1978 2018-04-19 20:11:44 @MossEurope list one but they are on back order and I haven't been able to locate another. When I was checking the oil it was akin to panning for gold.

1981 2018-04-19 20:11:13 Girls these days are pouring buckets of castor oil trying to get their eyebrows fuller these days so either donate it or love it! 
teehee
1982 2018-04-19 20:11:12 Try massaging castor oil into your sore areas :) its a miracle oil 
1983 2018-04-19 20:11:06 She also was on the side of big oil in at Stand Rock.... no surprise there she plays both sides... needs to go
1984 2018-04-19 20:10:57 Q: @EmmMacfarlane @MikePMoffatt If the #SCOC won’t *let* us bring alcohol from one prov to another bcs Can isn’t truly an economic union, wouldn’t that also mean they won’t be able to *force* AB or SK to send oil to BC? If so, BC may be able to stop the pipeline, but it’ll hurt.
1985 2018-04-19 20:10:56 Great. It might not be an automatic cure for things, but it's amazing what it can do. Ingesting oil seems to be one of the best ways to help anything internal. Report back when you find what works best for ya dude
1986 2018-04-19 20:10:51 Haircut 
Car insurance 
New tires 
New brakes-Saturday’s project
Wheel alignment & oil change-Tuesday’s project

Adulting is expensive af but you can’t beat the feeling of knowing you did all of it by yourself 
1987 2018-04-19 20:10:34 Luckily there was no oil 
1988 2018-04-19 20:10:29 ผมนี่ติดเกมส์ซะแล้ว ทั้งตีป้อม ทั้งโดดร่ม ทั้งชกมวย 5555555 โอ้ยยยโหลดเกมส์แข่งรถแปบ55555
1989 2018-04-19 20:10:24 Am not the idle or the lazy Nigerian, our president described as waiting on oil money or the government alone.
1990 2018-04-19 20:10:20 All with a gram of oil in my pocket
1991 2018-04-19 20:10:17 Man I Feel Like a Woman came on as I was changing my oil.. seems fitting #imsotough
1992 2018-04-19 20:10:15 The Book Of The Peace might be up for pre-order by that time, if you're lucky. :3 Otherwise I'd say go with Weapons Grade Snake Oil! It's a cyberpunky one about the less serious side of Faction life. And the main char is, ahem, quite familiar if you've seen the SJA pilot...
1993 2018-04-19 20:10:10 No such thing as military humor anymore. Not the best choice of timing, but demoted and forced retirement. Hell, Bill Clinton screwing in Oval Office, Killary selling uranium to Russians, Bushes starting wars over personal slights and oil. No charges.
1994 2018-04-19 20:10:07 サラダ油って体に悪いんですか？サラダなのに？
1995 2018-04-19 20:10:05 Oil? Awa wi ye! Lard.
1996 2018-04-19 20:09:57 *cough* there are multiple bootlegs floating around *cough* Wow, I really should put some peppermint oil on my chest for that cough...
1997 2018-04-19 20:09:36 He's trying to differentiate himself when he and Trudeau are on the same page when it comes to oil pipelines and the environment.
1998 2018-04-19 20:09:36 Spent almost 2 hours waiting on this oil change 
1999 2018-04-19 20:09:34 When you get an oil change and tires rotated, it’s like driving a new car again! Lol now gotta get this AC fixed... #grownupthings #adulting
2000 2018-04-19 20:09:29 Olive oil is a beverage
2001 2018-04-19 20:09:24 You see how that sounds condescending, right? “I know your doctor suggested this surgery/clinical trial, but just take this oil and change your eating instead!” It sounds like you think you know more than his oncologist. That’s ignorant and wrong place, wrong time.
2002 2018-04-19 20:08:51 Zane VS Zimele Bhengu, who will finally win the CEO position of Maluju oil, cause Both they won't give up. #ImbewuTheSeed
2003 2018-04-19 20:08:50 Same with fracking for oil/gas in USA. Many were quick to seek a ban but that industry lifted the USA economy out of a recession & was responsible for ~1.0%+ of gdp
2004 2018-04-19 20:08:41 Stephen has got his chefs hat on as we speak and about 1L of oil to get the party in your stomach started
2005 2018-04-19 20:08:33 Oh sooo not the same.  DōTERRA is all quality oil listed on the bottle
2006 2018-04-19 20:08:30 So real question here, if you are opposed to Alberta oil and international oil, how do you propose we drive, or heat our homes or manufacture all the products made with oil?
2007 2018-04-19 20:08:30 To infer doesn't necessarily that is what he meant though. At best, we can say that he shouldn't ve said that, but honestly I do not see why all the outcries. If knows he or she isn't waiting for oil money without doing nothing, why the worries?
2008 2018-04-19 20:08:28 4/13/2018 Baker-Hughes US Rig Count Total = +5 to 1,008 Oil +7 to 815, Gas -2 to 192, DIR = 70, HZ = 883, Vert = 55 (#RT)
2009 2018-04-19 20:08:27 Are they following oil minster’s comments these days 
2010 2018-04-19 20:08:24 They are going against oil pipe lines as they think they are so smart and going to be popular  in technology.  big laugh. They can’t even run a country
2011 2018-04-19 20:07:39 Trump bragged recently how we were exporting so much oil. What happened to America first?  We should not be paying this much for gas.
2012 2018-04-19 20:07:38 Sequoia this Saturday ,  then i get to change the oil in my whip  should be good till after edc
2013 2018-04-19 20:07:37 Wikihow said i could remove the adhesive from my iron on patch w coconut oil and baking soda and I was like that sounds fake but you know i still slapped it on there
2014 2018-04-19 20:07:32 Yeah let’s bring babies on oil rigs, operating rooms, courtrooms, chem labs. Just being your kid anywhere; what could possibly go wrong
2015 2018-04-19 20:07:27 regarding syria (middle east)- its all about the oil - can we even begin to imagine america with a significantly reduced rate of petroleum consumption - not to mention a u.s. economy without a militarized arms industry - 1492............................evolve
2016 2018-04-19 20:06:58 CBD oil (from cannabis, without the getting stoned part) helps a lot. There's been some great suggestions already, like Excedrin Migraine. Try to combine a few of the suggestions, then put a cold pack on the back of your head/neck and try to take a nap. Migraines are a bitch!
2017 2018-04-19 20:06:49 Your paranoia around governments and oil companies is amazing. How do you sleep at night. Humans are not going to be able to affect the climate, no matter what they do. As for so called peer review scientists, they are all part of the same crooked thinking. No respect.
2018 2018-04-19 20:06:48 Idiot,oil is decline,it's not Scotland that owns the whisky,it's companies,yer dafter than i first thought 
2019 2018-04-19 20:06:34 But you’re not dying of cancer. You don’t actually know what you’d do in that situation, and to suggest that you do is really insensitive to people who are stating death in the face. Your original tweet was no life-saving surgery, cbd oil, keto diet. That’s ignorant.
2020 2018-04-19 20:06:15 I mean, sure. [He chuckles and puts a few drops of olive oil in the pan to heat it up.] Do you want those?
2021 2018-04-19 20:06:09 Just passed a sign that said “ full-service oil change and steak dinner... $219” 
2022 2018-04-19 20:06:03 That they are used as oil for our cars
2023 2018-04-19 20:06:01 This middle aged man is hitting on me while stephen is doing an oil change on my car
2024 2018-04-19 20:05:58 I’ve shifted to about 2 meals a day so by lunch I get pretty damn hungry :P I start my day off with MCT oil in my coffee and that usually holds me over till then
2025 2018-04-19 20:05:54 Use Jamaican black castor oil and don’t use those locs if you do any styling. It should thicken back over time

2031 2018-04-19 20:05:05 #lazynigeriayouth 
I have worked @AmazonUK.
I have invested in a farm and I lost everything (300k).
I currently put food on people’s table through my very new startup - @DialACab_ib 
I currently work an 8-5 job that is 3hours away from my house.
Oh yes I am waiting for oil money
2032 2018-04-19 20:05:03 Congrats. 
So does this mean your world challenge program is over?
Or will you keep both going ?
2033 2018-04-19 20:05:03 And just read in an article from The Economist that " the clearest losers will be those blessed with ample fossil-fuel reserves and those who bet on oil for too long without reforming their economies. " One day Alberta will have to produce more than just oil.
2034 2018-04-19 20:05:01 Αγόρου μόνο για μπιτσόμπαρα είσαι να γυαλίζεις απ το baby oil #survivorGR
2035 2018-04-19 20:04:58 Our government travels the world promoting BAE for contracts in shipyards across the world. It’s all privatised. Same argument as ‘it’s our oil’.
2036 2018-04-19 20:04:48 Don'Terra or Living Essential Oil Scriptures.
2037 2018-04-19 20:04:41 Are you unhappy with your body wash because it dries your skin out ? Put a few tablespoons of baby oil in it. Shake before each use!
2038 2018-04-19 20:04:39 Bf took my jeep to get an oil change. Asked him to wash it while he’s at it. He straight up said “no I’ll let you do that.” Fast forward two hours later.. he washed it.
2039 2018-04-19 20:04:32 My car is not expensive, but I calculate a Leaf would cut my costs nearly in half, plus I'd never have to stop for gas or get an oil change.
2040 2018-04-19 20:03:57 I still need an oil change and my axel fixed but as far as payment i’m graby baby
2041 2018-04-19 20:03:48 How much money do you get from the oil industry 

BTW your last budget said you wanted to move away from natural resources... how are you going to do that?
2042 2018-04-19 20:03:42 Tea Tree Oil 
2043 2018-04-19 20:03:26 Noted  my tolerance has been low asf since I quit smoking daily. I already know an oil pen would have me geek’d lmao
2044 2018-04-19 20:03:12 And he said Nigerian youths are lazy looking for free oil money
2045 2018-04-19 20:03:12 @chris_bonafide FDA has approved CBD oil as treatment for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome. I have a feeling I’m going to be seeing these rare diagnoses more frequently 
2046 2018-04-19 20:03:07 Cairn stones near Culloden, Scotland. I am doing a daily painting series of miniature oil paintings, from my photos. I’ve done about a dozen and forgot to post - watch for the rest. They will be available for sale Woodland Celtic Games & Festival on the 28th-29th this month.
2047 2018-04-19 20:03:06 Good point.  If we are afraid of disasters we shouldn’t ever do anything.

Or we can work to mitigate them, hold people responsible if they do happen, while empowering growth, economic success, and displacing foreign oil suppliers.

Thanks for the discussion.  Have a safe day.
2048 2018-04-19 20:03:05 And that was How I got a call today from an unknown person saying I applied for a job at AGIP OIL & gas, that I can't even remember the last time I wrote an application let alone a CV.. Been Hustling since graduation from Highschool. So tell me how I became a #LazyNigerianYouth
2049 2018-04-19 20:03:05 He should try and get his hand on some snake oil too. I hear it's great for more or less anything. Even past tense bowel accidents.

2051 2018-04-19 20:02:57 . I use to put castor oil in everybody mouth

2054 2018-04-19 20:02:39 Palm oil is Destructive, hope other company’s stop using it
2055 2018-04-19 20:02:33 I agree that BC position on pipelines is nonsense and will kill oil and investment in Canada. A pipeline to get oil from Alta to USA our biggest customer is a priority and essential @JustinTrudeau
2056 2018-04-19 20:02:27 Outstanding to see your award winning olive oil reach the globe!
2057 2018-04-19 20:02:22 Tomorrow (Friday) is 420 Day (April 20th), thought it might be appropriate to talk about CBD Oil. Vid should be up by midday to afternoon, depending on my schedule.
2058 2018-04-19 20:02:08 You don't want oil drilling in the precious gulf!  Why is it ok to put a pipeline over fresh drinking water??!
2059 2018-04-19 20:02:03 Lemmie bring a set ah ganja by the lake and Maria nuh there wid brownies. And i plan to cook a nice pot ah oil down too eh.
2060 2018-04-19 20:01:59 my recent purchases from that aisle have included an outdoor rug, a bird feeder, a foil art thing where you scratch off the pattern and an ceramic oil bottle. No regrets.
2061 2018-04-19 20:01:54 Notice how your side has all three government branches and nothing's actually being achieved aside from: more 'globalist' trade, destroying the EPA (kochs money comes from oil), and getting tax cuts for the rich/corporations?

Why haven't they achieved anything else?
2062 2018-04-19 20:01:28 I really need to get my oil changed but it's such a hassle

2064 2018-04-19 20:01:23 Oh come on, they mean facts like "gender is determined by your chromosomes", "Climate change isn't real, or if it is, oil companies have nothing to do with it" and "The earth is 6000 years old".
2065 2018-04-19 20:01:21 Science experiments and exploration begin at 5pm tonight for our Tiny Discoverers!!  We will learn which objects sink and float, how a rain cloud works, make secret messages and get a little messy with water and oil art! See you soon!
2066 2018-04-19 20:01:16 “I need an oil change”
“I would give you one if I lived closer”
“Yeah normally my moms boyfriend does it but they broke up”
“Ohhh so she’s single, how old is she if I can’t have you I might as well take her”

I actually hate having friends in their late 20s

2080 2018-04-19 19:59:59 I've sent the 2013 study and the DeSmog piece off to a couple of energy economists who are current with global heavy crude oil markets. Will report when I hear back.

2083 2018-04-19 19:59:24 I’m 6 cups of coffee deep and haven’t had my lunch break cuz my car is getting the oil changed so I might just run 
2084 2018-04-19 19:59:10 Carols daughter cleansing conditioner, shea moisture Jamaican black castor oil hair masque, shea moisture hair milk, Virgin olive oil, and olive oil eco styler are my holy grail. I only wash my hair with shampoo once every 2 weeks. I use mane choice shampoo.
2085 2018-04-19 19:59:09 Upon first glance I thought this said "oil London" & thought you were telling us about something kinky going down when tour resumes.
2086 2018-04-19 19:58:52 I don’t think I will ever be able to say  I got an oil change and rid of my printer at the same time ever again 
2087 2018-04-19 19:58:46 This is what d he said 

“More than 60 percent of that population is below 30, a lot of them haven’t been to school and they are claiming that Nigeria is an oil producing country, therefore, they should sit and do nothing, and get housing, healthcare, education for free.”

2096 2018-04-19 19:57:38 Don't even sweat it! Try the lotion and seal with an oil and see how that works :)
2097 2018-04-19 19:57:20 Yeah! Jus recently started! Cleanse, toner, niacinimide, moisturizer n' spf in the morning.

And at night, double cleanse, toner, sometimes a clay mask, lactic acid, vit c, rosehip oil n' moisturizer.

2099 2018-04-19 19:56:58 Facebook Environmentalists: We need to stop using oil right now!

Me: The Canadian Pension Plan is balls deep in energy stocks and stopping the flow of oil would throw us into a depression, end pension payments, inflation would explode, and 1000's of people die

Them: no comment
2100 2018-04-19 19:56:42 Congrats :)!!
2101 2018-04-19 19:56:33 The only oil money I know is the   one I give to mama Conscience  to buy and groundnut and palm oil #lazynigeriayouth
2102 2018-04-19 19:56:28 Thennnnn seal your hair with an oil. I use virgin olive. Thennnn you put in the gel but use this process called shingling which is essentially you putting the gel in your hair in really small sections. As if you were flat ironing it. Look at vids on YouTube!
2103 2018-04-19 19:56:25 @terranovajoe I don’t think we saw an uptick in consumer spending b/c people were afraid so they paid down debt. Consumers(regular people) are just starting to feel like they can spend a little and if fake oil prices continue to rise it will have an effect on the market.
2104 2018-04-19 19:56:24 Help: I need to know why the girl who just screamed at me and called me a "shiny bald-head motherfucker" also told me to "get some oil for my head." Wouldn't the oil just make my head shinier, thus leaving me more vulnerable to insults?
2105 2018-04-19 19:56:16 It a pity that president Buhari could say such a thing, when jobs that are supposed to be served round some families in the highrank in the government are holding on to it, the oil money that are sold,  all are in  the bank accounts of Nigeria kabals.
2106 2018-04-19 19:56:15 More reasons to invest in renewable energy and ban the exploration of oil.

2109 2018-04-19 19:55:37 You can't cook french fries in butter.  The smoke point is too low.  You need to add oil to fry in butter.  With fries, peanut oil is tasty.

2129 2018-04-19 19:53:19 I guess the truth hurts, but what the President said is true. We the Nigerian youth are lazy. The oil money (easy money) is what most of us are targeting. Let's say it the way it is.

2133 2018-04-19 19:53:10 Have you tried tea tree oil on it? It works wonders on infected piercings. And what kind of metal is your jewelry made out of?
2134 2018-04-19 19:53:09 I have no doubt. Can't believe its even up for debate. As best we can, and as best we know, we don't purchase products containing palm oil.
2135 2018-04-19 19:53:08 Its not tar, it’s bitumen. It’s cleaner and more ethical than Saudi oil or from Venezuela and it is wanted/needed by the world AND will boost the economy. That is a good thing.
2136 2018-04-19 19:53:04 The oil price is far too high for them to mention.

2143 2018-04-19 19:52:00 I see on your ingredients list that you also have listed olive oil. Is this a corn-free source? What about the processing of the oregano oil? Do you use any of the hundreds of corn derivatives? It takes a lot of guts to comment on a random stranger's tweet about a *food allergy*.
2144 2018-04-19 19:51:31 There's a direct correlation between the number of people at the oil change place at one time and my blood pressure.

2168 2018-04-19 19:48:43 Once trump is able to dismantled our government enough to take control over it like putin did in Russia the two will lift sanctions, enjoy extreme oil wealth growth, their combined military weapons will be unmatched + they will easily overpower all other countries + ignore rules.

2174 2018-04-19 19:48:12 Al-Shifa plant had before the strik shipped veterinary medicine to Baghdad as part of the UN-sponsored plan to use oil shipments to buy food and medicine not available in Iraq. This might be the real reason of the missile attack.

2181 2018-04-19 19:47:29 However, oil is on the rise. And EURUSD may come down on carry positions.

2187 2018-04-19 19:46:44 The media knows that there are more oil and gas analysts out there than just Dan McTeague from GasBuddy, right?
2188 2018-04-19 19:46:12 are there any good oil deals for 420 weekend???
2189 2018-04-19 19:46:01 So you don’t think pharmaceutical companies, or oil companies, or big banks are responsible for ending American lives? Fascinating.

2191 2018-04-19 19:45:56 I know so many youths today, doing odd and degrading jobs just to make ends meet. Most of them do not even care whether Nigeria produces oil or not, they just want to survive.

2200 2018-04-19 19:45:03 1. Don’t expand the oil sands 2. Don’t subsidize BigOil in any way 3. Don’t build pipelines 4. Invest in green technology the way you’ve invested in oil & gas.

2206 2018-04-19 19:44:27 Sorry, and the one about not stopping oil and gas exploration. And the one about reducing GP visit costs. And the one about no new taxes until 2020. And the one about s**t in the walls at Middlemore. Have I missed any?
2207 2018-04-19 19:44:26 Apparently average Americans go home at night and oil and caress their guns.  Who knew?

Half the house too hot and the other froze.  I’ve put in baseboard heaters in half the house, now getting the other half done.

2257 2018-04-19 19:39:36 I'm a Lawyer. I went to school and studied my ass out in this educational system that doesn't work. A system you and your peers created. Your son went abroad came back bought bike #50Mill. Then crashed it. Then he went aboard with the oil money. Came back to standing ovation.
2258 2018-04-19 19:39:33 "Thank you!"

Smiling. Behind his mouth-plate.

"Oh, and it's energon. Not oil."
2259 2018-04-19 19:39:30 The infrastructure of the country depended solely on Oil and with the market prices going down the support system fell with it. The government did fail nationalizing industries. Notice how it is not the process and the policies that are an issue, it's the corruption.
2260 2018-04-19 19:39:21 Soybean oil is not something that has increased in every country. 

Other countries consume mainly corn oil, sunflower oil, rapeseed oil etc instead as added fats

So no, I did not. I probably contributed in the us though. Like all other added fats
2261 2018-04-19 19:39:16 Weed and CBD oil does NOT kill pain like opioids do. For low level pain relief and discomfort it's fine, but against truly excruciating pain it does next to nothing.
2262 2018-04-19 19:39:15 Variety of reasons....aluminium being one, poly pharmacy another, it ain't referred to as T3 diabetes for nothing either. Cannabis oil will reverse, yes, you heard right, reverse this condition in all animal models, including humans. Now scat ya dirty little Pharma rat.

2276 2018-04-19 19:37:56 See lazy Nigerians doing nothing. Only waiting for oil money to spend.
2277 2018-04-19 19:37:46 Don't worship "science".  Science and high technology gave us oil spills, Nuclear waste, chemical weapons, and many other very deadly modern ills.
2278 2018-04-19 19:37:35 He didn’t use the word “lazy”, but implied it when he said they “... sit down, do nothing and want free housing, healthcare and education because Nigeria has been oil producing nation”

2280 2018-04-19 19:37:13 Si. Next time you rent a car, rent electric. Smells clean. Starts like magic. Accelerates faster than all gas cars on the road. It's a space car. No brake pads. No oil changes. Uses a lamp's worth of electricity to charge. Driving a gas car now feels like using a rotary phone.

2283 2018-04-19 19:36:56 It's an oil from cannabis but has no THC. It soothes you and helps your body relax in spite if the pain. Doesn't work for everyone.
2284 2018-04-19 19:36:53 No three year grace period... Except for continuing new block offers on land, and the 31 oil and gas permits currently active, which run out as far away as 2030. So at least a 12 year grace period...

2290 2018-04-19 19:35:44 Rep. Jim Bridenstine (R-Okla.), has been confirmed to lead NASA. He reject the very notion of climate change(big oil backing?) and has the same background in science as a rabbit. This destruction of education and of our country seems deliberate at this point
2291 2018-04-19 19:35:41 I need an oil change 
2292 2018-04-19 19:35:41 I have heard that CBD oil is very helpful for anxiety!  I would love to try it for mine!  They don’t really have the good stuff here in GA though. 
2293 2018-04-19 19:35:39 Trump CAN'T fire Pruitt. He's not finished implementing the agenda! When the First People have nothing left, when our parks are oozing with oil/mining wastes, when we all share the the pain of #Flint poisoned water, when there no wild species left..
2294 2018-04-19 19:35:36 He is also selling off our oil reserves.  These were supposed to be for WWIII
2295 2018-04-19 19:35:22 If i buy that bag it better sneak me in to Afghanistan and steal oil on my behalf.
2296 2018-04-19 19:35:09 He was actually referring to his son who has never worked in his entire life but uses a power bike worth over 50m naira after all Nigeria is an oil rich country. Perhaps, @MBuhari isn't aware that every family in SE can boast of atleast 2 graduates no matter how poor they are.
2297 2018-04-19 19:35:01 Not true at all. He is NOT the only president to serve during 8 years of war. We have been at war somewhere since 1941. Never a break that some of our troops are somewhere trying to force democracy on an illiterate people or secure our oil supplies.

2304 2018-04-19 19:34:17 Could even get CBD oil which would relieve pain without the “high”

Might not be entir ely for the right reasons, but we'll take it. Hope Grassley doesn't back down when Trump puts ethanol back on table.
2307 2018-04-19 19:33:26 I've always said big oil's the enemy of democracy
Anybody whose read extensively on this industry knows it's true
The bigger this industry gets in Canada, the stronger their anti-democratic influence will become
2308 2018-04-19 19:33:20 I managed to find time for a quick can of Neck Oil earlier...
2309 2018-04-19 19:33:09 Funny how? Oil & gas are directly useful. #Dilbit is not oil, and requires further safety measures and controls.
2310 2018-04-19 19:33:07 and to that, we're going to need the money associated with our resources and those resources include our oil. We're global leaders in the responsible extraction and transport of petroleum; someone's going to supply the need, why not us? END
2311 2018-04-19 19:33:03 Oil change on my car done and I washed her up too and I still did other errands?? This nice weather be making me want to get shit done 
2312 2018-04-19 19:32:58 I do as well, specifically to help with the sticking problem. Keeper claims it prevents sauces from sticking to the noodles, but I haven't noticed it sticking any better without adding olive oil to the water.
2313 2018-04-19 19:32:43 Thank you. I agree with everything you said.
2314 2018-04-19 19:32:39 NG is 40-50% cleaner than oil and coal, if we want to make a real impact on GHG we will have to use it
2315 2018-04-19 19:32:39 i use any of the Garnier Whole Blends!!! The only one I don’t use is the Moroccan Oil one because my hair is so fine it makes it look too slick but i love the rest!!

2318 2018-04-19 19:32:31 "Nigerian youths are lazy & uneducated. Always wanting free oil money" ~ PMB

 SANI SAEED ALTUKRY: Sir, you are absolutely correct. One of the lazy Nigerian
youths who is enjoying free oil money had an accident with
the power bike he bought with free oil money not too long
ago,
2319 2018-04-19 19:32:31 Beds are burning by Midnight Oil, safe flight and enjoy Oz. Its an amazing place !!
2320 2018-04-19 19:32:19 If you keep an eye on oil usage it's fine. Used less the harder I drove, about 1ltr/6k. Some of my best point to point times were set in that car. Economy no better than my Octavia thought but I easily saw 35+ mpg every day. Lowest was 15mpg on a journey I hope never to repeat
2321 2018-04-19 19:32:06 What about inverting it and use buoyant tanks floating below the ocean surface with a winch/generator on the sea floor.

Potentially unlimited expansion.
Great way to reuse knowledge and experience from the offshore oil industry.
2322 2018-04-19 19:31:53 Sorry for the oil bots.  This Trans woman and commonwealth citizen thanks you for not just worrying what oil robots want.
2323 2018-04-19 19:31:25 Me nuh fraid a nuh threat, me nuh fraid a nuh oil or nuh damn powder

2325 2018-04-19 19:30:56 Buhari told world leaders at a Common Wealth Conference that we are all a bunch of lazy and uneducated young people who just want oil wealth
2326 2018-04-19 19:30:48 Pretty soon our #bicycles will have a real dashboard. Check my tires every other day, but I’m lazy about changing the oil. 
2327 2018-04-19 19:30:45 The US produces just 2 mill bbl per day of WTI crude oil. So, I would be careful to compare it with WTI prices. It is better to compare with condensate prices, which fell to 22 USD per barrel last month.

2329 2018-04-19 19:30:24 My point was that crime may be rising across the board in CA (as you said, it's a mess) but Trump isn't necessarily wrong. If you look at the stats, I would assert that the further you get from the major immigration hubs, the slower and less dramatic the rise of crime.
2330 2018-04-19 19:30:01 Have you tried fish oil? It works for Ru!
2331 2018-04-19 19:29:49 Congratulations Shea.   
Have a very good season.
2332 2018-04-19 19:29:35 Full service at the gas stations #OldThingsIWantBack

Yeah, they used to pump your gas, wash your windows, check your oil, coolant and tire pressure.
2333 2018-04-19 19:29:10 When will Trump supporters stop supporting T? When they can’t breath the air anymore, drink the water, can’t go to favorite parkland, there is an oil spill or drilling in their backyard, they can’t get health care, WHEN? Answer me Congress, people.
2334 2018-04-19 19:28:59 Just rub the oil into your skin that's what I do and I only have 10000 spots per cm square
2335 2018-04-19 19:28:52 @MBuhari was directing his speech to the economist that claim Nigeria is an oil producing nation, where citizen supposed to having those benefits ,d economist forgot where ng was when he came to power in 2015, bad economy, Boko Haram, alot out of school etc.
2336 2018-04-19 19:28:51 for all u guys so bearish oil you would never know $XLE is UP 0.24% today! After the selling of the news on OPEC not seeing $100 oil... And tomorrows Friday on an OPEC meeting... GL! @AdamMancini4
2337 2018-04-19 19:28:50 @realDonaldTrump Somebody needs to do something about oil and gasoline price  manipulation !!!!
2338 2018-04-19 19:28:48 So who is else uncomfortable with the knowledge that the Saudis dictate US Middle East policy and Western oil prices?
2339 2018-04-19 19:28:38 There’s a deeper meaning, of course.  African oil producers adopt Gulf Arab oil producing orientation. Or maybe just “Africa takes over OPEC from the  Arabs”
2340 2018-04-19 19:28:20 Genco Olive oil, that looks sharp!

2342 2018-04-19 19:28:13 I bought bees wax to use with mineral oil for sealing a butcher block cutting board. Also can make lip balm with it.
2343 2018-04-19 19:28:10 “More than 60 percent of that population is below 30, a lot of them haven’t been to school and they are claiming that Nigeria is an oil producing country, therefore, they should sit and do nothing, and get housing, healthcare, education” #PMB's Statement on the youths

2346 2018-04-19 19:27:51 We gotta get some prayer oil and throw a whole bucket on sark
2347 2018-04-19 19:27:44 What's wrong in wanting freebies as an oil rich country? Didn't the older generation in this country get freebies? We have a situation where a few have conered it,  sold public institutions built by the countries money to themselves and still want all us to bear the cost. So sad.
2348 2018-04-19 19:27:35 He didn't even need to refer to majority of the youth.

The issue is: how is what he said related to what he was asked?

Last word surrounding matters of NE & Free Trade agreement, he went on oil and idling and free health care

And his fans were attacking Cable for reporting
2349 2018-04-19 19:27:35 Adesina you are one of the most corrupt and lazy youth that the old man is talking about. All what you are after is the oil money.
2350 2018-04-19 19:27:22 Currently still getting my oil changed
2351 2018-04-19 19:27:19 You can use that or Jamaican black castor oil

2359 2018-04-19 19:26:22 Any beard oil recommendations?
2360 2018-04-19 19:26:21 Congratulations and look forward to seeing you later in the year @VIRNow
2361 2018-04-19 19:26:17 Canada: Shipping oil, restricting beer.
2362 2018-04-19 19:26:14 Funny how it was China, which opposed the war, that was the biggest foreign beneficiary of what became Iraq's booming oil business industry following the end of the war and that the USA did not really receive any large quantities of oil, as a result of the war. Nice try.
2363 2018-04-19 19:26:12 I really gotta stop riding around in my car like I don’t need a oil change lol
2364 2018-04-19 19:26:08 Given the appalling leadership US/UK have had since 9/11, & the suffering caused by regime-change wars which had nothing to do with 9/11 & everything to do with propaganda & oil, I fail to see why we or our govts should be dictating policy to any sovereign nation.
2365 2018-04-19 19:26:04 A lot of them (Nigerian youth) have not been to school & they are claiming that Nigeria has been an oil producing country, therefore they should sit & do nothing & get housing free...- Buhari

All Nigerian youths are hardworking - Atiku 

May thunder fire any of them that lie
2366 2018-04-19 19:25:55 I blame Aykut man, he has been pooring oil on this fire for an entire season. Somehow it’s like he doesn’t even care about Galatasaray, he’s been riling both the players and the fans up for months against Beşiktaş. I honestly don’t understand what his purpose in doing so has been
2367 2018-04-19 19:25:47 Funny how BC looks the other way when it’s US tankers importing oil 
2368 2018-04-19 19:25:33 Oo0o.. I should check my email regular.. I had a 2nd job interview for a chef on a oil rig.. 8 months ago...

2372 2018-04-19 19:25:00 He’s no oil painting ! But I guess now he is
2373 2018-04-19 19:25:00 once we showed them where the oil was,
2374 2018-04-19 19:24:56 But you are a Nigerian youth. You shouldn't botger about all these things. After all, we have oil
#LazyNigerianYouths
2375 2018-04-19 19:24:55 I too don’t have a toaster and I totally use oil n a pan, or quickly letting the bread sit in the oven, with oil too, depending. Oh, sprinkle a pinch of basil on the oiled bread, and get ready for fancy town
2376 2018-04-19 19:24:54 isn't the news fun? Was it yesterday, as oil knocked on $70, we were hearing how the glut has been worked off? @chigrl
2377 2018-04-19 19:24:54 I'm for clean energy,  I'm also realistic. The oil being shipped through the pipeline is potentially going offshore, so it has little to do with clean energy in BC.  The world still demands oil and will for many years.  A few months without oil in BC will show it's necessity.
2378 2018-04-19 19:24:51 Dead skin cells of the body can be removed by applying mixture of olive oil and salt. Replacing salt with granulated sugar can work too.

2380 2018-04-19 19:24:31 I think it does help with hair and lash growth (although I haven't ever used it long enough to see results). People use it on their scalp, their eyelashes and their eyebrows. I think I might try all of them. But I need the oil first.

They run slightly less boost than a conventional setup due to placement, and a little more lag, but no need to intercool or have custom manifolds made.

2404 2018-04-19 19:22:13 If you're ignorant of oil and gas Law, I am not. If oil is explored on your land in US, you own the land. In Nigeria, the Govt owns lands not individuals. Don't be "lazy", check before your tweet.
2405 2018-04-19 19:22:08 I have another no-need yeast loaf going. This one has more salt + added sugar and oil. It smells phenomenal in the oven. The oil makes the dough easier to handle so you can keep the flour to water ratio lower.
2406 2018-04-19 19:21:58 So, in your mind, it’s ok to have more tanker traffic, as long as they are bringing a refined product into Canada, we just are allowed to sell our excess crude oil, for a better price than the USA is willing to pay.
2407 2018-04-19 19:21:56 Nigeria youths want free oil money & dats why one Nigerian youth took free oil money and bought power bike of 57million, he got accident with it and was flown to Germany for treatment with free oil money. He was flown back to the country in a private jet hired with free oil money

2412 2018-04-19 19:21:38 Me I am not lazy oòoòoo. Oil money sef no reach my side. I go school, in fact I still dey go again. It doesn't take much to know that those at the   hems of affair don't have our interest at. Nigerian youths its time to take our future forcefully.

They had him killed like a dog, for what, money and oil.

2429 2018-04-19 19:20:02 I’ll be doing a face mask after work, drinking ample water, and diffusing some of my favorite essential oil blends in preparation of Cole’s new album. I’m so excited I could combust.

2438 2018-04-19 19:19:01 @MEAAIRLIBAN At first we thought it was water but then I realized that it was really oil. When he opened his suitcase we discovered that most of his belongings were full of oil, so at that moment, as soon as he picked up his suitcase, we went to give notice to the airline.

2451 2018-04-19 19:18:15 @MEAAIRLIBAN So here is that happened. On March 22, My husband and I took a flight with MEA from Paris to Dubai, making a stop in Beirut. Everything went well, except that when he picked up his suitcase it was completely soaked in oil. Really soaked!
2452 2018-04-19 19:18:15 So should I not get cute for the oil spill
2453 2018-04-19 19:18:02 Build gallows.

Knot nooses.

Oil trapdoors.

At least PRETEND laws are equally applicable to EVERY American who has committed such crimes.
2454 2018-04-19 19:18:02 Right! If you don't change my oil and rotate my tires so I can go! 
2455 2018-04-19 19:17:45 Massage them with coconut oil and they will go away!
2456 2018-04-19 19:17:37 “More than 60 per cent of the population is below 30, a lot of them haven’t been to school and they are claiming that Nigeria is an oil producing country, therefore, they should sit and do nothing, and get housing, healthcare, education free,”
2457 2018-04-19 19:17:35 Better get my aphrodisiac I’m massage oil ready
2458 2018-04-19 19:17:34 well yes the saudi/russian reduction in production to keep the barrel high is part of it, but from conversations I have had with Oil Distributors the price increases we have been seeing lately are due to inflation and rise in interest rates.
2459 2018-04-19 19:17:31 Can you define what makes one decent? Is not wanting to tear families apart is indecent? Not wanting to watch the LGBT community be abused as "lesser" is indecent? Not wanting to cut down the forests, or fill the oceans with oil, or our streams with toxic runoff is indecent?

2477 2018-04-19 19:15:59 Maybe oil companies should pay to clean up their spills rather than taxpayers footing the bill. That'd save a few $$$

2481 2018-04-19 19:15:45 Funny thing is Buhari's attempt was to insult the oil producing state youth, but ended up making a joke of himself.

2488 2018-04-19 19:15:23 If I had the time to review, I'm sure I would find that the majority of these projects are in some way, handing over profitable opportunities for big real estate/oil/gas/chem/coal investors that pay for @EPAScottPruitt's plundering career. #BootPruitt

The evening is approaching, the day is almost through.
Do you have enough oil for the journey with a good bit more to spare?
Have you been to the sellers before you came so you know you have the fare?
2493 2018-04-19 19:14:45 I feel the same way about Jiffy Lube and not even sure they exist any more. Don’t give a f though. No oil change chain will ever have a name that rolls off the tongue like Jiffy Lube.

2511 2018-04-19 19:12:08 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.

2513 2018-04-19 19:11:58 @NASA @ScienceMarchDC @neiltyson @rdfrs @weatherchannel It is flat out dangerous to ignore or deny what humans are doing in burning fossil fuels. Our planet CANNOT be a pawn used to protect the profits of big oil.
2514 2018-04-19 19:11:41 he should have stopped at “a lot of them haven’t been to school”.. cuz as an oil producing country, we at least deserve free education & health if it wasn’t looted all the time. So ‘our claim’ are even right if we are being technical about this tbh.
2515 2018-04-19 19:11:36 so the fact that oil is mentioned does it mean he is referring to the southerners and Easterners ? oh Nigeria my country why did atagiru do this 
o weep for my country

2531 2018-04-19 19:10:21 Looking at this only sporadicly, like every Two hours or so, keeps me emotionally resonably stable. Shutting down Twitter also helps. if natgas is the widowmaker, what's Oil then at the Moment?  It's a Two sided sword, this volatility.

2541 2018-04-19 19:09:33 I just put a little bit of olive oil in the water while I'm cooking the pasta.  That keeps it from sticking together, and I personally think it makes it taste better too.

2547 2018-04-19 19:08:43 Without giving the credit to anybody, including Buhari, things are looking up for us. Except tension in the middle East eases, oil will hit $80/b before year end. Nigeria's capital importation now is massive. The only thing FG needs to do now is to step in with heavy regulations.

Did the media cover what MANY people thought about 9/11? Nope. Stamp "TERRORISM" on it and invade for oil. Point is you can't change the past.

2560 2018-04-19 19:07:48 Your boss Buhari who also clearly falls into the category of our youth he was condemning (no record of his GCE) does not know that Nigeria's greatest assets are her YOUTH. He probably think its oil.

2577 2018-04-19 19:06:27 An employment medium's potential to employ large numbers of people isn't determined solely by the amount of investment sunk into it. Yet an economic illiterate just suggested to me this is why green energy employs less than the oil production sector.

2581 2018-04-19 19:06:15 The McDonald's menu was simple and easy. Then they had to satisfy the green industry and give us a bunch of high price salads and other crap that nobody wants there. Now the menu is too big and complicated. Plus, they destroyed their fries when they changed the cooking oil.
2582 2018-04-19 19:06:14 Matt. Will you be having the credit facility reviewed soon? Almost double production and oil price is marching on. Surely Washington bank will be happy ??

2679 2018-04-19 18:57:09 And what does 60% of the youth population mean? It means the overwhelming majority of Nigerian youths are not educated and still want freebies from the government because of our oil producing status.

2690 2018-04-19 18:56:16 I get your point,but i dont think that US will attack unprovoked . By doing that,US could lose many allies and Iran could pose a threat to the oil flow in the region.

2765 2018-04-19 18:48:08 Very uneducated statements. We should be trying to source more of our oil needs from the most responsible petroleum production in the world in Canada. Less from the middle east where human rights and environment mean nothing.

2860 2018-04-19 18:40:50 I’m so sad/mad that I dropped my brand new 80 dollar face oil this morning and half of it spilled  that’s literally 40 dollars gone to the trash
2861 2018-04-19 18:40:49 But on a daily I lightly spray water ( my hair gets really dry ), then I use hair oil ( my own mixture of avocado oil, rosemary oil, Jamaican castor oil and olive oil)  and then lastly I use shea butter to lock in the moisture
2862 2018-04-19 18:40:32 Am I the only person that likes the smell of Amla oil?
2863 2018-04-19 18:40:31 Hold your horses. Other than BC sabotaging Alberta oil and Ontario screwing itself, Canadian provinces love each other. Except Quebec. They hate everyone.

2865 2018-04-19 18:40:19 I’d like to slap the guy who’s idea it was to remove important gauges from cars. Like temperature and oil pressure and shit. Most people can’t understand the stupid pictures they put in place, at least people know that Red = Bad.
2866 2018-04-19 18:40:16 This man is so insensitive to the struggles of the nigerian youth striving to make something out of nothing. He mentioned 'nigeria being an oil producing country' as if we ever had a share in the oil revenue! Revolution is near

2873 2018-04-19 18:39:33 No disagreement but I think it's very unfair to pin last season on Bednar. He was tossed into a frying pan filled with oil that was already boiling. It was a definite recipe for disaster and that was very clear before the season even started. This season was an example of him.
2874 2018-04-19 18:39:32 What's up with all the weird bible passages? Trump is not a moral person. Don't get confused. He is a snake oil salesman. Why, oh, why can't you see this?
2875 2018-04-19 18:39:24 we need to just "take the oil"... I don't see the confusion @JeffMerkley also, we need to rename Facebook to something more "my privacy" oriented... 3 guesses
2876 2018-04-19 18:39:18 That I get no hours for and also got car insurance to pay I need to fix my car window cuz it won’t come back up need new breaks need a oil change and gas in that bitch so yah I’m broke

2879 2018-04-19 18:39:07 I’m surprised Kinder Morgan hasn’t cancelled this oil pipeline and said they are going to put in a sunshine and wind pipeline from Alberta. The BC government would pay for it and kinder Morgan could make their money as project managers
2880 2018-04-19 18:39:02 People don't realize how liberal both George the Senior and George the Younger were on social issues. So both went to war over oil. They did so because we demand low gas prices. George the Younger loves dogs, baseball and mountain biking - that makes him ok in my book.
2881 2018-04-19 18:39:01 The #ClarkSisters have prayed and nearly dead folks came back to life. #WendyWilliams better not try to mess with that oil! I wouldn't come for nobody who could get a #prayer through.

The sanctions were Saddam's choice. Meanwhile France and Russia were getting rich on illegal oil sales. And he was filling mass graves with innocent civilians.
2889 2018-04-19 18:38:17 Only 650  I paid 40 for a oil change like get real
2890 2018-04-19 18:38:09 Remember when US & UK claimed that Iraq had weapons of massive destruction, bombed & invaded, overtook some oil business? No such weapons found but hey... Good times!

2897 2018-04-19 18:37:48 The oil sands are far from being the worst emitters. Canada imports oil from producers that are worse, and the tankers that bring in the oil are also emitting. Protesters are selective in their targets

2901 2018-04-19 18:37:38 Trump's son in law was trying to get Saudis to reign in ISIS that was funded and created by Deep State & Obama by offering deals as Middle East has no more oil. They have no power except terrorism use. Trump surrounded by back stabbers. Pence is President after Trump's 8 years.
2902 2018-04-19 18:37:22 We are the only oil  producing and exporting country that isn't feeling the impact of having oil. We have one of the most lucrative natural resource in the world but we are suffering like pirate ridden Somalia .
2903 2018-04-19 18:37:11 I can't even remember the last time I thought of Nigeria as an oil producing country sef talkless of wanting anything for free

2912 2018-04-19 18:36:25 Why not? What better way to turn your AR-15 into a *real* assault rifle? A weapon of ass destruction? Then again, my ass hardly needs the help. A round of Taco Bell after a night of hard drinking, and the UN weapons inspectors are knocking at my door.
2913 2018-04-19 18:36:23 & we definitely can't reach our climate target if we increase oil production. I would love to see any evidence you have to the contrary.

& I do think NL's offshore oil is 
1. Under taxed
2. A threat to our fishery
3. A threat to our environment

2919 2018-04-19 18:35:58 I told someone that i didn’t have to get an oil change cause my pops checked my oil, told me it was low, and that i needed to buy oil... once i added the oil, i didn’t think i needed an oil change cause the oil was fresh. Pretty sure I drove dude nuts that day
2920 2018-04-19 18:35:46 Are they automates or heat release. Is there a sprinkler pump.

Even sprinklers don't necessarily put out the fire, they will only suppress larger ones.

What's the fuel source? If it's an oil based propellant...

Oil beat Montreal in 1980, lost in the final in ‘83 and won it in ‘84. All within 5 years of entering the NHL.

2989 2018-04-19 18:29:48 Twitter/other social media can be fantastic but it also can be, on days, a spewing of toxic negativity the equivalent of a giant oil spill.

You do what adds to your happiness. Always. And step back from anything or anyone that takes from it as needed.

3002 2018-04-19 18:28:48 Can we just be honest. The green energy sector has had 1/100th invested in research and development compared to oil extraction and gas refinement sector.

3012 2018-04-19 18:28:04 I was just told that my cottage cheese recipe is "amazeballs"

So for all of you, here is what I do:

1 bowl of cottage cheese
Shake some garlic salt over it
Shake some basil and oregano over it
Introduce a HINT of sesame oil, a minuscule drop
Stir

3016 2018-04-19 18:27:45 The bombing in Syria is terrible and will have consequences for years. But hey, guess that doesn't compare to a literal coup that went on for over a decade started by a dude who used a tragic event to stage an oil raid.
3017 2018-04-19 18:27:39 I’m not. I’m perfectly aware of his brand of “oil & gas” journalism
3018 2018-04-19 18:27:34 bombarding the senses.. Is that the title: Room of Oil" ? You just gave it a wonderful review. A quiet installation out of the mere mid-20th century. It's like the saying: If you want to be heard, whisper. that alludes to your discovery of R. Wilson's art. I'm speechless; in awe.
3019 2018-04-19 18:27:32 It's crazy, the US is producing more than we can use in light shale crude and we can't sell it internationally yet oil prices keep rising.
3020 2018-04-19 18:27:30 The should disappear ooooo I envy them.  Would you say they are lazy waiting for freebies and oil money?

3048 2018-04-19 18:25:18 Try baby oil. While I never in my life used it on a real life infant, it does take off all kinds of things like magic. Excellent eye makeup remover.
3049 2018-04-19 18:25:15 I had some reservations about the effectiveness of the peppermint/sugar/coconut oil lip scrub that I cobbled together, but my lips feel freakishly smooth now.
3050 2018-04-19 18:24:57 Hibiscus Facial Cleansing Bar,Pomegranate Oil (use as your daily facial moisturizer accompanied by SPF,at all times) and Avocado Moisturising Overnight Serum (use daily at night after cleansing)
3051 2018-04-19 18:24:56 Don't worry, the oil wasn't injured.
3052 2018-04-19 18:24:52 So you would like your oil to arrive by truck or rail? Because it already does. Lac Megantic ring a bell? It's already rolling through your towns night by night. On the Lac Megantic comment , I wonder if most Vancouverites or Victorians know that there is a Country east of Hope.
3053 2018-04-19 18:24:47 Building a pipeline to protest the building of pipelines??? Seems as sound as suing Alberta for sending oil to BC but also suing them for not sending oil....

Maybe they could build it through BC to teach the government that OILsands pipelines are bad?

3056 2018-04-19 18:24:15 Add that to the cost of the wti differential and extra cost of oil by rail due to delayed ppls and policy costs like mktg boards and green energy and you are getting close to $1 bn.  We must be v rich ti afford this.

3064 2018-04-19 18:23:00 Getting an oil change turns into getting your entire car repaired 
3065 2018-04-19 18:22:58 yeah but not as complicated as confit. Just like cooking a bunch of bacon, onion, garlic then using the leftover fat to sauté the chard or add a lil stock/oil to braise it. Alternatively maybe simmer it like collard greens, but I saw ur other tweet abt losing nutritional value.

3070 2018-04-19 18:22:44 I have a Grand Cherokee now - built in Detroit like God intended. Next version of the Grand Cherokee (WL) in 2020 will have a hybrid. I think I may buy it to hedge against increase in gas. Noticed oil crept up to $70. The shale guys must be happy

3072 2018-04-19 18:22:33 I’m literally never coming back to the dealership for an oil change ever again. I’ve been here over a fucking hour.

3074 2018-04-19 18:22:30 It's not about sex. It's about his "breeding" comments from yesterday: you don't need a eugenics program if you can keep "those people" from even reproducing. 

And then you go get the oil and rare-earth metals and probably, Trump thinks, the vibranium.

From last few days your channel is alerting consumer, stock market investors & traders about surge in oil prices, but would you evaluate the weakening of INR v/s USD and vis-a-vis it's net impact on exchequer. I beleive this will give through analysis.

3091 2018-04-19 18:20:50 I know That’s why I said it’s not perfect. The day the last drop of oil comes out of the ground will be a day to celebrate by then we’ll have alternative energy & no wars in the Middle East. Going for ground source heat next using my piling experience with a simple drop rig.
3092 2018-04-19 18:20:36 He said 60% of our population is under 30. Alot of them haven’t been to school but claim that housing, health  and education should be given to them free because we are an oil producing country.  What he said wasn’t fair IMO but he didn’t say 60% youth want freebies .
3093 2018-04-19 18:20:19 Sure, just like the government doesn't pick and choose who will get the the money like Foxconn, or oil subsidies or any other economic aid like the tax cut to the rich or Citizen's United that says corps are people. Maybe you should stop being a selective reader.

3095 2018-04-19 18:20:11 maybe they do. maybe they believe essential oil is meant to be used not as treatment, but just to make things smell good, and that's their mission?

3098 2018-04-19 18:19:59 I know the hippy types will be here soon, so before they bitch about oil, can we be honest that the green energy sector is not even a tenth of the employer potential of the oil industry and probably will never reach even that.

3102 2018-04-19 18:19:39 Attracting foreign investment? The oil is an export same as hydro to New England for us. We can reach our Paris agreement goals with the oil still flowing & NGas replacing coal & oil eventually. Should NL stop producing oil?
3103 2018-04-19 18:19:35 Get some alternative energy going then that is accessible as oil.  Bearing in mind the prices NEED to competitive with oil otherwise the middle class & poor will not be able to afford.  Time to offer solutions NOW not later, otherwise it doesn't work.

3119 2018-04-19 18:17:24 Can the federal government please place a ban on these semi-automatic idiots?
3120 2018-04-19 18:17:18 Kale and a tiny bit of olive oil with some salt is to die for 
3121 2018-04-19 18:17:17 Most of the rational, thinking world already aware, long ago. 
What's shocking is Swedes not revolting en masse. Interesting.
3122 2018-04-19 18:17:11 Are you pulling your support for Keystone? Instead of shipping raw oil to Texas and buy it back at higher prices we can instead just refine it here?
3123 2018-04-19 18:17:08 But leading experts like @martijnkatan recommend vegetable oil. What to make out of this?
3124 2018-04-19 18:16:58 tea tree oil smells fucking disgusting

Grab a skillet and oil it up, woman!

3137 2018-04-19 18:15:15 I put seasalt spray in and sometimes coconut oil
3138 2018-04-19 18:15:09 Ademas pagamos el fuel oil carisimo, porque se lo compramos a Shell (oh casualidad señor aranguren) habiendo otras alternativas mas economicas a nivel regional.

3140 2018-04-19 18:14:27 Please where can I find this oil that's making Nigeria's youth lazy? 
I'm tired of schooling and working myself out.
3141 2018-04-19 18:14:25 Just had a matcha smoothie with Cbd oil in it and I wish I could have one everyday now
3142 2018-04-19 18:14:18 I guess she doesn’t remember the oil spill? 
3143 2018-04-19 18:14:15 hot tea and a heating pad!! CBD oil if you have access to it - my cramps get so bad i black out sometimes and CBD is my saving grace 
3144 2018-04-19 18:14:13 Let’s just say it did get to that amount, like someone already mentioned it has more to do with your state taxes, & the amount of oil cost per barrel. This is why i stayed in my tweet earlier that i didn’t blame trump, nor would i blame Obama...
3145 2018-04-19 18:14:12 It’s a corner liquor store/Mexican/Sri Lankan restaurant in Northridge, California called Baja Subs. All their vegan Sri Lankan items are cooked with coconut milk and coconut oil 
3146 2018-04-19 18:14:10 Deep condition every week 
Hot oil treatmeants once or twice a month 
3147 2018-04-19 18:14:09 doesn't sound right to me
my company, COGS (cost of goods) reduction is a constant activity; we are always trying to find cheaper vendors for the big ticket items

also, something about psychology of your salary vs price of oil vs salary of coworkers
3148 2018-04-19 18:13:52 Oil paint is expensive and his portrait will require more than his predecessors'
3149 2018-04-19 18:13:48 nah, I was drinking motor oil like that one dude in the finals, much like you would in a totally normal, realistic situation.
3150 2018-04-19 18:13:27 "More than 60% of population is below 30,a lot of them haven’t been to school & they are claiming that Nigeria is an oil producing country, therefore,they should sit, do nothing & get housing, healthcare, education free”-Buhari. Is this one a Leader? @DeleMomodu @ProfOsinbajo
3151 2018-04-19 18:13:21 Must be nice to have a garden dome that you get to play around in all day when you marry a man in the oil field  #youdidntreallygettheironyourown
3152 2018-04-19 18:13:17 This oil change for my car is no joke
3153 2018-04-19 18:13:17 I used to copy them when I was an art student in oil on canvas 
3154 2018-04-19 18:12:59 doused myself in tea tree oil, firmly believing it will solve all of my problems
3155 2018-04-19 18:12:59 Wait...is that John Cena?

3158 2018-04-19 18:12:47 I guess all the youths in Nigeria are all from the oil producing states. . Sir pls stop defending what’s not. It’s clear what President @MBuhari meant. We will surprise you sir. Come 2019.
3159 2018-04-19 18:12:46 Why is the USA still buying oil from them? Explain that to me please. Oh that's right Republicans never have any new ideas. Take take
3160 2018-04-19 18:12:28 I remember serving in a riverine community in Southern Ijaw where able bodied young men climbed the school buildings to removing roofing sheets to mend their huts, leaving most of the classrooms roofless. You sit down and wait for oil money. You are lazy.
3161 2018-04-19 18:12:26 I’m glad the rain washed my car a bit. Wish it would’ve also given it an oil change and rotated the tires and changed the breaks and updated the software that woulda been great.
3162 2018-04-19 18:12:19 Oil prices go up and down for no real reason, apart from making the oil cartels more money.
3163 2018-04-19 18:12:17 I have warm water and olive oil infused crispy bacon snack bits 
3164 2018-04-19 18:12:15 Lol!! I've never drank in my life, so that all sounds like a really scary idea.

3166 2018-04-19 18:12:04 There is that rule at my workplace, but unfortunately that's the only scent-related rule - my boss currently has an essential oil infuser going, and my asthma is getting pissy about it. But - 3 days left of this job, so... eff it.

3168 2018-04-19 18:11:51 Right. Find one that is or don’t complain about oil companies then. They get you to your job while giving your kids asthma. You can feel good about your work. Thinking that some man being paid by the oil companies cares about your vote is foolish.
3169 2018-04-19 18:11:45 Use African black soap or a cleanser bc normal soap is bad for your skin especially rubbing it directly on your face. Your face gets dry and produces more oil which causes acne. Also buy a moisturizer.
3170 2018-04-19 18:11:36 He needs to do those oil injections, fam.
3171 2018-04-19 18:11:35 free oil change and tire rotation NICE
3172 2018-04-19 18:11:32 Poa tu
3173 2018-04-19 18:11:28 Oil - WTI - Price nearing a top, not much room, $72 to $74 then a large wave down - if WTI breaks above $75 there is one outlier that it could run up to $85, so watch and Caution if your long or hoping for $100 not in the cards. This move is a bit higher than projected.
3174 2018-04-19 18:11:24 Susanna, wow that is a very beautiful oil painting, I wonder who the artist is, it's amazing, great detail of the people from myself an Artist. Anyway wow could not notice a likeness to

3177 2018-04-19 18:10:49 A pea-sized amount of baby oil can act as a shine hair serum before dashing out the door.
3178 2018-04-19 18:10:39 @todd_harrison Gartman recently switched from equities to oil. Was this capitulation of bears?
3179 2018-04-19 18:10:29 What is the correlation with Es & oil,  thank you chigrl.

3184 2018-04-19 18:09:41 @ReformedBroker long term commodities cycle (not just oil, gold) has begun, we all need to talk more about what's available to average investor, ie: DBC, DBB, etc. Excellent hedge
3185 2018-04-19 18:09:39 Lucic at half price? No team will take that contract, even at half price, unless they add was substantial. Also, the player has the final say thanks to the NM clause.
3186 2018-04-19 18:09:38 My Top 10 photos from the Schaeffer's Oil Spring Nationals at Tazewell Speedway where Dakotah Knuckles won $5,000 in his first ever Super Late Model victory.
3187 2018-04-19 18:09:33 Is it oil?
3188 2018-04-19 18:09:25 It's Amazing how I've been feeling since starting to use CBD Oil.
3189 2018-04-19 18:09:20 But you can’t watch the playoffs and see all these quick skilled teams dominating and think there’s a place for Lucic on the roster.  The game has passed him man. Gotta figure out the most creative or least painful way to make him disappear
3190 2018-04-19 18:09:05 Alberta law to restrict the amount of oil going to BC is not unconstitutional.  They have just been given the green light to allow or restrict whatever good or service between provinces that they feel like for whatever reason. (NB reason is profit protection)
3191 2018-04-19 18:08:54 And oil immediately turns lower. Gartman is the best/worst.

3193 2018-04-19 18:08:32 The same thing happened to me! I use moringa seed oil and vitman e oil and it helps A LOT. But if I forget even one day it’s dry af again 
3194 2018-04-19 18:08:30 How do you think we got oil?
3195 2018-04-19 18:08:30 I’m sure those oil companies will be giving their employees raises from the windfall #taxscam too, NOT.
3196 2018-04-19 18:08:26 Scented candles

Bath salts, scrubs etc

3201 2018-04-19 18:07:48 So hard for people though- it's in EVERYTHING processed Even when I first went #keto #NSNG was wrongly using salad dressing w/no carbs or sugar but didn't look at seed oils. Again heard @VinnieTortorich say use REAL olive oil/vinegar no bottled dressings

3208 2018-04-19 18:07:07 44 years and you have nothing to show for it but a measly $17 billion heritage fund America is awash in oil and it's a hell of a lot cheaper to frack than use dump trucks

3213 2018-04-19 18:06:38 I guess Magellan/Elcano's ships probably used a little oil for light and heating? Presumably from non-fossil fuel sources though, so still carbon neutral.

High oil prices help Russian economy but will kill ours. Please keep gas below 2.75$ a gallon.  The fake 100$ a barrel oil created the last great recession. Keep THEM from doing it again.

3256 2018-04-19 18:01:55 So effectively the BC govt can set a limit of how much oil they will allow into the province and it's fully constitutional.  Likewise, Alberta can fully restrict how much oil leaves the province to BC and that's also fully constitutional
3257 2018-04-19 18:01:45 But it's OK for u and your family to have the free oil money.

3262 2018-04-19 18:01:19 They were protesting Alberta oil long before Trump ever came into power.
3263 2018-04-19 18:01:15 We have no family here. Plus I’m not in oil and gas anymore I’m working all over Canada so we can live anywhere. Wife wants to go home to Winnipeg and well, happy wife happy life.
3264 2018-04-19 18:01:09 Nothing could be farther from the truth than the fact that Nigerians live with a sense of entitlement because of oil.Nigerian youths expect very little from government,they struggle to make a head way. That our president can't see this shows he's still in 1985.

3267 2018-04-19 18:00:56 It was clearly the vow that won it...

In the face of all the polls..

Despite no answer on currency..

Despite the £20k FOI resistance that established Salmonds lie about non-existant EU legal advice..

Despite the wreckless deoendence on high oil prices..

Damn that vow.
3268 2018-04-19 18:00:55 Wow Called  myself copping oil early, and my plug is dry...so y’all know anyone w oil in rva tell ya girl while I wait in my other response
3269 2018-04-19 18:00:52 For several reasons actually, 
But one Id consider to be the biggest is because it is very closely related to hemp, which could be a more effective but less lucrative substitute for many huge industries. Oil, clothing, paper, etc. Basically big buisiness isnt a fan of it
3270 2018-04-19 18:00:43 They fight for god - gold oil and drugs
3271 2018-04-19 18:00:39 WSSC crews are investigating the cause of a sewer overflow this a.m. @pgparks Bladensburg Waterfront Park in @PrinceGeorgesMD. Residents should avoid the Anacostia River in this area. Signs will be posted. Early indications are an oil substance was discharged into the sewer main.
3272 2018-04-19 18:00:38 I would say that his high school should be ashamed of turning out such an uneducated child, but sadly it is the norm.
3273 2018-04-19 18:00:31 I just made a dentist appointment sleep clinic appointment and an oil change appointment. AND yesterday I made an eye appointment. I’m such an adult.

3278 2018-04-19 18:00:18 Don’t bash your head LOL the olive oil softens the wax up so when you do go see the doctors they’ll be able to remove it easier, but if they don’t then tell them how much of an inconvenience and hopefully they will~
3279 2018-04-19 18:00:15 Leave the Oil in the ground and go about your business
3280 2018-04-19 18:00:12 BCLib house leader Mike de Jong is calling for an emergency debate in the #bcleg on government’s decision to send a reference question on oil pipelines to the BC Court of Appeal.

“We’re coming for you”
3283 2018-04-19 17:59:52 Scientist have now made oil from human bones.
Your value as a human, a gallon of gas.
3284 2018-04-19 17:59:51 If corn oil is made from corn, and vegetable oil is made from vegetables, then what is baby oil made from?
3285 2018-04-19 17:59:46 Put out there at half price with a trade down on our first. I think Bode Wilde should be the Oiler's guy anyway, big fast and he has an adventurous spirit and style.
3286 2018-04-19 17:59:38 Looks like the firing of Cons in Tech, media, academia justified. Just a consequence and they should know better.
3287 2018-04-19 17:59:37 Hi @HammerheadA2 yup, I do mean "affluent".  Can you explain your second point?
3288 2018-04-19 17:59:17 I never thought I could use an oil cleanser because my face tends to be oily at times. Since getting some in a subscription box I've found it leaves my skin feeling soft & supple. An added bonus, I'm seeing tiny lines just disappear!!
3289 2018-04-19 17:59:14 there's oil in your head. I am proud of you !!
3290 2018-04-19 17:59:09 Huh. Is he just going to dump Scrabble tiles on the floor & put letters together randomly? Because I think THAT would produce a better sentence than what that boy typed. This is a product of public schools in an affluent area in FL. Hmmm.
3291 2018-04-19 17:58:49 I loveeeeeee when I take my clothes/jackets and they still smell like my perfume/body oil. Omg omg omg. It drives me wild.
3292 2018-04-19 17:58:46 Hey @JustinTrudeau, do you really want to go down in history as #JustinCrudeau? Do the right thing & don't build new oil pipelines. The world is watching. #StopKM #StopPipelines
3293 2018-04-19 17:58:46 Blunt is also owned by big oil. Those are his 2 biggest donors & his time is over. Also, Greitens must go! MO deserves a Gov that wants schools fully funded, invests in clean energy & moves MO forward.

3297 2018-04-19 17:58:23 Even Obama knew enough to make the USA self sufficient in oil and gas! Our gang simply employing a divisive political tactic aimed at re-election.
3298 2018-04-19 17:58:17 I put vitamin E oil on my legs cuz I don’t have any tanning oil. Holy shit I feel the sun baking 
3299 2018-04-19 17:58:16 Hate waiting to get my oil change 
3300 2018-04-19 17:58:14 No one takes a bath on Friday, purifies himself as much as he can, uses oil or perfume in his house, then proceeds for prayer, and does not separate two persons sitting together, then prays as much as is written for him, and remains silent
3301 2018-04-19 17:58:05 Look at the last bastions of the religious Republicans in Hannity that while George Bush and Dick Cheney ruling the world with a war I fought and killed in as a war that would be paid for by Iraqi oil and oil by GODS might blacken the sands of our country with the oil promised
3302 2018-04-19 17:57:56 Oil kumar legacy continues
3303 2018-04-19 17:57:55 Even in a good retail job, this happens. The amount of people who think vinegar and oil are the same thing are baffling.

3311 2018-04-19 17:56:34 You'd like yo think I was. I stuck some oil based  gloss on it first and painted on top of that.  Worked a treat

3314 2018-04-19 17:56:21 That moment I go get an oil change & the guy tells me I have a snake under my hood.

3318 2018-04-19 17:56:11 Saving the planet is good idea. We can't agree on that Chase? Are you struggling with the fact life is dependent upon its' environment? We should be working to become less oil dependent and not creating, "the largest – and most destructive – industrial project in human history."

3323 2018-04-19 17:55:49 At Holton, I initially began oil painting in an Impressionism style
3324 2018-04-19 17:55:18 The oil boom in AB raised the value of the dollar, which contributed to the decline of manufacturing in Ontario before the crash.
3325 2018-04-19 17:54:59 Mike D taught me how to check/ put oil in a car when I was like 12 in tuxedos parking lot "Yo heads come over here and learn something"
3326 2018-04-19 17:54:54 I go to school everyday so i can gain knowledge of what i don't know before, and someone somewhere without an SSCE Certificate is calling me a Lazy Youth Depending On The Country's Oil?

Fuck You! Fuck Your Oil!!

3327 2018-04-19 17:54:46 You sold weapons to Turkey ...I don't trust you anymore to protect Syria. All about oil you are as bad as America. Shame on you @PutinRF_Eng @KremlinRussia_E @EmbassyofRussia
3328 2018-04-19 17:54:36 All the time, doctors say use olive oil when there’s literally things they can do to get rid of it. The ringing affects sleep and concentration and in exam halls all I can hear is this ringing. So I tell my mum that I need to go to the doctors for it and she says okay after a bit
3329 2018-04-19 17:54:19 Of course. #foodsecurity is not only about quantity, it is also about quality. For instance, the (rural) Central Asian diet is rich in carbohydrates (primarily bread) and fat (cotton oil), yet poor in essential vitamines and minerals (vegetables and fruits).
3330 2018-04-19 17:54:04 Breakout the swimsuit, suntan oil, sunglasses, and where’s the pool?
3331 2018-04-19 17:54:03 They have a state owned oil company, we don’t. Big difference.
3332 2018-04-19 17:54:00 Really hot oil just fell on my hand and it hurts so bad omg
3333 2018-04-19 17:53:56 Did you know that one of Benito Mussolini's favourite dishes was a mixture of garlic, olive oil and lemon?
3334 2018-04-19 17:53:48 When did you stop working for the people and start working for American oil companies that want to export Canadian resources to China?

You should resign Rachel.  Do your life's passion and become a full time oil lobbyist, people might actually think your still a politician.
3335 2018-04-19 17:53:27 Some good dupes for Rihanna’s body shimmer oil are Bath and Body Works - At the Beach ($18.50) and Victoria’s Secret Shimmer Bronze ($25)

3338 2018-04-19 17:53:18 If by "good" you mean "affluent," I would agree. But if you mean as far as reasonably possible from the immigration epicenters, it's a different argument entirely. Truckee, Redding, Tahoe, Eureka, etc
3339 2018-04-19 17:52:55 But you’re ok with Vancouver being the largest coal exporting port on the pacific... oil burns cleaner than coal and can be used by the same markets. Want to truly help the environment. End the distribution and use of coal. Not oil.
3340 2018-04-19 17:52:30 I agree QC should let NL use its power lines. 
But this pipeline is more in the interest of attracting foreign investment than national unity. I don't agree we should be expanding oil production and I don't agree with building pipelines.
3341 2018-04-19 17:52:19 So many of us did, and then watched as the snake oil salesman became president! 
3342 2018-04-19 17:52:15 A tip: (mostly for shiitake mushrooms) if you want to make it more fragrant, cook in dry heat first then add oil... it’ll brown the mushrooms more nicely rather than putting oil first (esp mushroom soaks up a lot of oil)
3343 2018-04-19 17:52:09 I may be no oil painting but at least some peeps will fancy me for my £££ saviness!

President Buhari has said many Nigerian youths are uneducated, not ready to work and dependent on revenue from oil to survive ...... also waiting to get social amenities free without doing anything.

DO YOU AGREE WITH MR. PRESIDENT?

You can reply as well
3347 2018-04-19 17:52:06 That oil painting will require more oil than the Exxon Valdez spilled.  Sorry.

No. No I won't.  I'll probably actually just buy a few more.

Could you not afford a separate fryer lads?
3359 2018-04-19 17:50:59 OK I gotta get out of here. If the short sellers want to take this market down, they need to take, oil, and semi's, down. Fat chance...

3361 2018-04-19 17:50:50 And it’s more than about oil and money. The AngloZionist / Neocons want to break the axes of resistance.

3364 2018-04-19 17:50:33 Having managed both cargo-carrying systems for a while now, the "my pocketses" complaint is overstated.
3365 2018-04-19 17:50:33 I'm reminded of a chick I met at a con once. She was so hardcore into eating less then like 500 callories a day that she raged when the waitress brought out asperagus that had oil and salt.
3366 2018-04-19 17:50:23 Nice of you to join us! Call us if they can't hook ya up with passes 
3367 2018-04-19 17:50:16 We don’t have antigravity because the deep state fears the loss of profit from the current oil industry.  A lot industries are linked into oil and the change would be very significant.  They are also holding onto “privileged technology.”
3368 2018-04-19 17:50:15 Overheard at the oil changing place:

Employee 2: What the fuck are you talking about. That is not in the Bible. What Bible are you reading?
Employee 1: The one I wrote myself.

On a side note, is getting drunk and riding roller coasters a good idea?  That sounds like a bad recipe.

3376 2018-04-19 17:49:41 And no Palm Oil so my family will let me sell them in our cafe !
3377 2018-04-19 17:49:37 The Oil Companies are leaving daily.  Not because they attackWorkers. Liberal Morons attacked the Oil Industry. Justin Trudeau in true JT form has lied to every group in  and abroad about energy sector. When investors have no faith it hurts every sector FOOL.
3378 2018-04-19 17:49:36 Addition of olive oil is actually a great way to enhance omega-3 in the diet and large studies show increased fat through nuts and olive oil decrease all causes of death compared to a low fat diet.
3379 2018-04-19 17:49:33 They should be quiet, enjoy this years show and buy all the oil off the shelf throughout the year & RoilBAA will be back!

3381 2018-04-19 17:49:28 No, the story goes a female pours vegetable oil on the ground & tells her lil siblings or off spring to come in the kitchen & get their juice, she's playing a prank on them but she never thought they'd run right into the stove & break the glass.

3386 2018-04-19 17:49:00 If you need to stop extreme oil, why don’t you guys start by protesting Russia, Saudi Arabia or Nigeria? Afraid you’ll get shot or imprisioned?
3387 2018-04-19 17:48:51 Dollarization looks nice in the short term. Smart way by uncle Sam to neuter nationalists and continue plundering venezuela's oil et al, but its unsustainable in the long run. Non oil industry will begin to suffer and wealth gap increase together with corruption. ask #Zimbabwe

3389 2018-04-19 17:48:41 No, what's bad for business is people like you advising the industry at all, which is why even our terrible NDP government kicked you off the oil sands advisory group
3390 2018-04-19 17:48:33 Who bought the oil? They are not smuggling a few cigarettes. Same in Libya. There are not enough suitcases for that kind of cash. Nobody seems interested.
3391 2018-04-19 17:48:31 Presume it's Oil Seed Rape....
3392 2018-04-19 17:48:06 The Holy oil and the Extreme oil can cure cancer. that's why cannabis is such a threat to Big Pharma.

3394 2018-04-19 17:48:00 Frying bread in olive oil is one of my small joys
3395 2018-04-19 17:47:57 Is it because we awarded the contract of the oil refinery to USA instead of stupid British companies
3396 2018-04-19 17:47:36 US oil falls from more than 3-year high as dollar and rates rise #energy #oil
3397 2018-04-19 17:47:36 Following the oil crash, GERS clearly shows the gap between revenue and expenditure and, in the absence of any credible plan to bridge that gap, separatists are now arguing that the GERS that they said once proved their case is now suddenly flawed.
3398 2018-04-19 17:47:31 I’m at Chevy getting an oil change. And there’s an Adeer here getting his as well. Of all the seats open he decides to sit right near me.

3401 2018-04-19 17:47:17 Just in. 10th ethical investigation into Pruitt announced. It seems the criminal in the White House refuses to get rid of the criminal at the EPA. Why? Simple money from the oil barons.

3408 2018-04-19 17:46:51 "You know just because the majority thinks something is right, doesn't make it right. So, that is up to us, the people that see the wrong, that see the injustice, that stay educated, stay informed, stay involved. And there's an old phrase 'the squeaky wheel, gets the oil".-Otep
3409 2018-04-19 17:46:44 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
3410 2018-04-19 17:46:44 That @BrooklynHanz freestyle got me ready to gun butt somebody! That shit is straight back in the days dirty block with abandoned car leaking oil in the gutter, crack house next to and empty lot littered with dirty clothes, pissy matress and drug paraphernalia nasty! Shit!
3411 2018-04-19 17:46:37 He kills lines.  I’d find a stop gap.  Something in the 3M range.  For all the griping about RW we don’t talk near enough about how shallow LW is.

3415 2018-04-19 17:46:08 No fly zones lately gave been used to sart to destroy a country.
They harvest terrorists and pull out oil while preparing to destroy the region.
No respect for life.
3416 2018-04-19 17:45:56 but Joe! He’s not drilling oil! So that means it’s a-ok! for the environment! We gotta let him do it because tunnels are the fuuuuuuture. 


3417 2018-04-19 17:45:26 Housing prices here are so high because of oil workers being fleeced that people rather live in "tent city"

3426 2018-04-19 17:44:35 @bpnutrition  I'm not sure if I invented this, but it tastes exactly like a mocha: Coffee + Brain Octane Oil + 1 Tbsp grass fed butter + 1 tsp maca + 1 tsp reishi + 1 Tbsp raw cacao powder + 2 tsp local/ Manuka honey
3427 2018-04-19 17:44:33 Imagine if @JustinTrudeau was also concerned about protecting our oceans from increased tanker traffic and inevitable oil spills as well?
3428 2018-04-19 17:44:31 Yup. Just gotta see if the coolant is in and my oil changed and we good. Can't wait to whip it down the highway today.
3429 2018-04-19 17:44:29 Bashir, dont be a blind follower to an extent such that when you reflect on your past you feel disgusted by your by it. Nigerian youths fight for survival everyday & most have forgotten about Oil. PMB fucked up, it wont be his first nor his last, when it's glaring just admit so.
3430 2018-04-19 17:44:25 ok then when oil leaks out doesnt it affect all types of life?
3431 2018-04-19 17:44:22 It appears the official is saying shame on them for wanting to breath air that is clean and is not polluted by gas and oil.
3432 2018-04-19 17:44:21 My wife: We need bread, milk, baking soda, and vegetable oil. Make sure to write that down. 

Me: Nah, I won’t forget.

3436 2018-04-19 17:43:55 You need to get a CBD oil gummy bear
3437 2018-04-19 17:43:40 Absolutely YES!  Taking CBD oil has kept me from having to seek knee surgery. About damn time FDA starts approving this stuff.
3438 2018-04-19 17:43:35 @EPAScottPruitt I'm seriously concerned over the EPA's decision to roll back Control Technique Guidelines that help state, local, and tribal air quality agencies set standards for reducing air pollution emissions from oil and gas industry sources that contribute to smog formation

3441 2018-04-19 17:43:33 When the CIA will stop regime-changing for oil (& other interests), when the UN will be democratized (with no veto powers mem.), when we'll have ways to dethrone a dictator without killing millions in the process, when the US war criminals will have gone to jail, then we'll talk.
3442 2018-04-19 17:43:30 Prayers up, he can do it!!!!! Lost of veggies and cbd oil the Rick Simpson kind

3445 2018-04-19 17:43:18 Is Ramzan cooking oil coming with something new?
3446 2018-04-19 17:43:16 War is to the 21st century what oil was to the 20th; the pillar that supports the global economy.
3447 2018-04-19 17:43:15 Lmao dead end  the low life struggle. I remember one time when I had the Audi it was slammed and I took it to Morgan territory and I came back with a loose ass oil pan and no AC lines cus they got fucked so don’t go up there lol
3448 2018-04-19 17:43:14 The orc blushed and chuckled. "Sure, lets go there! And were gonna need a lot of that oil, looking at the size of your cock..." He said as he walked towards the horse, prepared to follow him.
3449 2018-04-19 17:43:13 @pepboysauto Had an appointment for an oil change yesterday at 5 called me at 5 to say they couldn’t do my appointment because of short staffing go in this morning for an appointment at 8. While checking in I’m asked what year my car is and let them know it’s a 2016 then show him
3450 2018-04-19 17:43:01 Hey @JustinTrudeau, do you really want to go down in history as #JustinCrudeau? Do the right thing & don't build new oil pipelines. The world is watching. #StopKM #StopPipelines
3451 2018-04-19 17:42:55 Learning the squeaky wheel gets the oil
3452 2018-04-19 17:42:48 Tatcha beauty oil and silk primer!
3453 2018-04-19 17:42:31 No doubt the sinister influence of Big Oil had a hand in this. Big Vinegar, too.
3454 2018-04-19 17:42:30 Plastic is made with oil.
I dont know if you ever noticed but oil has quite the lobbyist capacity - its what our wars are all about.
3455 2018-04-19 17:42:26 When the oil sinks in and takes over your life!  #MsJouvert
3456 2018-04-19 17:42:19 Thanks to the expansion of Kinder-Morgan.  I'm sure the U.S is now pissed they're not going to be able to screw us over Oil.
3457 2018-04-19 17:42:10 She is following Cathleen Wynne into green debt and delays acting then panicking on pipelines.  She places a carbon tax on albertans then says 60% will go into general revenue.  She Hires anti oil advisors and increases taxes on tertiary care facilities.
3458 2018-04-19 17:42:10 When I had mine on my nose, I'd spray it with a piercing aftercare spray twice a day and alternate between tea tree oil and vitamin e oil. It helped clear up my keloid pretty quick. I hope it goes away soon! Keloids are a pain in the ass!

3460 2018-04-19 17:41:56 you look like oil
3461 2018-04-19 17:41:56 FACT CHECK
Norway generated £381b more than the UK Government in tax revenue from their North Sea operations between 1964 to 2016 — while producing 4.7 per cent less oil and gas. In the two years since the oil price dropped, Norway generated more than £29bn in oil and gas revenue
3462 2018-04-19 17:41:56 Yeah.....oil, natural gas, coal, cow-burps, and lobbyists
3463 2018-04-19 17:41:54 For an oil change... cause i go in for a $30 oil change, and come out spending $300
3464 2018-04-19 17:41:45 Fuck no. I was gonna replace it with an all aluminum cause it's stronger but nigga told me a clamp got loose that's a dub. Saved some money. Just paying for a clamp the vacuum testing n allat shit n a oil change. Pray they put coolant in my shit.
3465 2018-04-19 17:41:37 Again. That is the reality of the job. Send your faux shaming to the selfish oil companies that laid these folks off.
3466 2018-04-19 17:41:33 Probably was on his way to change Lurie’s oil
3467 2018-04-19 17:41:32 Today I got my tires rotated and my oil changed...I am ashamed at how happy I am because of it.
3468 2018-04-19 17:41:31 Also car people where can I get an oil change for cheap, cheap cheap? 
3469 2018-04-19 17:41:28 You need an oxygen mask to be able to be able to breath in that sardine can. Oil is cheap now so time for airlines to use bigger & comfortable  planes! This is one reason we have passenger rage all the time.
3470 2018-04-19 17:41:25 My mom's used to squeeze the juice into a cup with a tablespoon of castor oil
3471 2018-04-19 17:41:21 Bruce smirked at Garrosh, he’d then motion his head over to his studio apartment 

“Then come on, I’ve got baby oil with your name on it!”

3476 2018-04-19 17:41:01 You're becoming part bunny 

Also, oven roasted carrots with olive oil, salt, and pepper are the best <3 Carrot juice too~
3477 2018-04-19 17:40:57 Oil about to break a barrier at 70. 

Signals from Saudi Arabia aren’t encouraging and there will be a few months lag before shale production can be accelerated in US to increase the supply.
3478 2018-04-19 17:40:52 Hey @JustinTrudeau, do you really want to go down in history as #JustinCrudeau? LOL. Do the right thing & don't build new oil pipelines. The world is watching. #StopKM #StopPipelines
3479 2018-04-19 17:40:45 Kidnappers in Nigeria are youths

90% of arm robbery is done by youths
Cyber criminals in Nigeria are youths
Oil bunkers are youths...
TBH Buhari is right
3480 2018-04-19 17:40:44 Trudeau asked how can Cda have a free trade agreement w/ Britain when he can't even move oil or beer fr province to province, Trudeau says he'll study the ruling, references internal Cda interprov'l free trade agreeement, and "progress."
3481 2018-04-19 17:40:34 I’m the worst vegan ever how did I not know palm oil wasn’t a vegan ingredient I feel so bad :’)
3482 2018-04-19 17:40:32 I'd guess it's usually like a tablespoon of sugar, two of soy sauce, and a little swirl of the hot sesame oil, the rest I just kinda hurl in haphazardly

3486 2018-04-19 17:39:56 For those of us who did use of English in our 1st degree will understand PMB's statement was referring to youths who haven't gone to school or make any effort but sit down at home expecting freebies cuz they are from oil producing nation and the word "lazy youth " was never use
3487 2018-04-19 17:39:29 I never argued EE would have passed NEB process. I am stating that fall in oil prices affected both TMX & EE. Fundamental difference between TMX & EE was that government never required an emissions test for TMX as it supported previous government NEB review. #cdnpoli
3488 2018-04-19 17:39:26 I'm pretty sure I just ate 5 tablespoons of oil and I feel really sick right now 
3489 2018-04-19 17:39:25 the cucumber salad: I cut up the cukes + onions, salt them, and let them rest in a colander for a while so they sweat some water out, then I whisk up a mix of soy sauce, a few cloves minced garlic, hot sesame oil, sugar, salt, pepper, red pepper, paprika, vinegar until I like it!
3490 2018-04-19 17:39:18 You just called me a lair, after I gave you examples of countries that we can say oil is more like a curse to them from anyway you want to look it. And I said oil is more of a curse than blessing. Please go back to the first tweet.

3492 2018-04-19 17:39:09 Soo i took my car in for service today at the dealer and they told me that my oil change was going to be free this time ? umm yaaaasss I’ll take it
3493 2018-04-19 17:39:07 @EPAScottPruitt  BLM's recent proposal to weaken crucial methane waste protection. Doing so defends the worst actors of the oil & gas industry, and puts their interests above the health and safety of American families and their communities. #humansoverbusinesses
3494 2018-04-19 17:38:56 that's some v expensive coconut oil
3495 2018-04-19 17:38:46 For wavy or curly hair: spray bottle with a cup of water, table spoon of sea salt, tablespoon of aloe, teaspoon of coconut oil, essential oils (I used 2 drops of lavender and 2 of eucalyptus) you’re welcome
3496 2018-04-19 17:38:45 The $2 estimate is a direct response to us getting cut from next doors oil. To clarify, I shouldn't have said "nobody" can pay housing prices (who can is a different topic); a great deal of people are already locked out. Getting further out of hand will increase that number.
3497 2018-04-19 17:38:44 I need to go put in a hot oil treatment...but I'm too lazy
3498 2018-04-19 17:38:42 Lmao make we dey sip tea dey watch, them go follow am go daura by may 29 2019, since they are all lazy youths waiting for oil money.

3501 2018-04-19 17:38:25 Higher gas prices make shale oil and tar sands oil economically feasible.  Guess who pays.

3510 2018-04-19 17:36:46 Forget Big Oil, Big Sugar and Big Tobacco...Big Pasta transcends the evil of all of these combined.
3511 2018-04-19 17:36:36 @zerohedge with a global growth slowdown imminent, led by China, how is it possible oil demand growth comes close to the estimates? Projections were based on $55-65 oil, demand destruction has to be amplified at $70-75 oil. India & China can’t sustain consumption at these prices.
3512 2018-04-19 17:36:35 Lol...sir, I read the news. Here's the thing, increase in oil prices makes up the increase in reserves not debt. BH holds no LG. They're hiding. Corruption is fighting back. The judiciary is weak and can't be touched by the executive or else there's trouble. It's deep sir.
3513 2018-04-19 17:36:27 It's also a question of whether CA's crime would be *even lower* without immigrants. Comparing it to other states doesn't address causality like these folks think it does.

Secondly, you said Oil is a curse and I was telling that's a lie they tell us when there are countries that used oil well.
3517 2018-04-19 17:36:00 Your tanning oil would've been so lonely in your cart! You were being considerate! 
3518 2018-04-19 17:35:55 I need consistent male friends, cause a bitch literally been driving around with 0 oil in her car 
3519 2018-04-19 17:35:41 We got Morgan CBD oil.
So far in the 2 hours since taking it:
1. She finished 3 bowls of food and hasn't been sick (mildly impressive).
2. She is completely clean.
3. She still doesn't like Misty.
3520 2018-04-19 17:35:22 @MBuhari waiting for oil money revenue allocations u say.. The real oil money doesn't exceed nnpc and our politicians. He was talking like he / Nigeria has ever given any allowances to the youth. Even Allawee gan nah strong we use dey collect am. 
#LazyNigerianYouths ? How?!
3521 2018-04-19 17:35:19 So yea, big picture. Canadian oil = objectively better than Russian or Saudi. Not a fail, just the use of brain cells. Try it sometime.
3522 2018-04-19 17:35:15 In 1939, A second barter deal with Italy is concluded providing for the exchange of Mexican oil for rayon.
3523 2018-04-19 17:35:12 But the wars are also sold as "good wars" promoting freedom, democracy and #HumanRights.  That it seems to be most about Oil, dominance in general, installing USA "friendly" regimes, and getting rid of the opposite, and that the "good things" seem to be down the list. Not clear.
3524 2018-04-19 17:35:07 weed lube [cannabis infused coconut oil ]__ ok
3525 2018-04-19 17:35:06 Me: Puts oil in my car.

To myself: “yeah I’m pretty much a mechanic”
3526 2018-04-19 17:35:02 The market got use of a cushion because of such high #oil inventories but that "cushion" is almost evaporated which should make the markets more sensitive on the geopolitical front.

3528 2018-04-19 17:34:42 Shell and any other company responsible for sustaining oil doesn't give a fuggggg. Mo money!!
3529 2018-04-19 17:34:36 I will change my oil tomorrow!
3530 2018-04-19 17:34:33 take a snapshot of him, take to FedEx/Kinkos and have it converted to a fake oil painting.  Cost maybe $200 if that much.  They'll even stretch it and frame it for a few extra bucks.
3531 2018-04-19 17:34:33 I’m so pumped to slather myself in tanning oil and BAKE
3532 2018-04-19 17:34:32 Pained Niccur... You are one of those lazy and depending on oil money youths Buhari is talking about..
3533 2018-04-19 17:34:19 Someone ask him why the CBC is destroyed all the originals in it's archives eh?  And if he's ever visited an Oil spill....
3534 2018-04-19 17:34:12 $HMPQ is a leader in the CBD oil market! Watch it!
3535 2018-04-19 17:34:12 キャップのOILで混乱しそうw
3536 2018-04-19 17:34:11 1992 VH would be sad to learn that 26 years later, Crystal Pepsi would be long gone and the oil companies and old men would still be running the show.
3537 2018-04-19 17:34:09 i just have oily ass skin so it’s hard to find a primer and foundation that doesn’t my me look like i just dumped oil all over my face lmao
3538 2018-04-19 17:34:07 لاتجلطنا دخيلك
3539 2018-04-19 17:34:05 Ah yes, because blocking this pipeline will totally save the environment, and the Russian and Saudi oil that gets used in the place of Canadian oil will be far more ethical and environmentally concerned. You're so smart. Tell more Mr planet saver
3540 2018-04-19 17:34:00 ConocoPhillips' "sustainable" oil price - the one that keeps its production flat and covers investor payouts - is now $40, according to CEO Ryan Lance @ColumbiaUEnergy summit. Huge reduction from 2014; I remember analysts saying shale was toast at $60-70.
3541 2018-04-19 17:33:34 Shit, if she wants to play musical plates with pepper pots I ....you get the idea.
3542 2018-04-19 17:33:25 " . A lot of them have not been to school and they are claiming that Nigeria has been an oil producing country, therefore they should sit and do nothing and get housing, healthcare and education free.” # PMBinlondon
3543 2018-04-19 17:33:20 What pisses me more is this bullshit talk about moral and values. These neo-cons allways need an "enemy" but at the end of the day? Oil baby. Money.
3544 2018-04-19 17:33:15 That’s a lot of oil paint, if it’s life-sized
3545 2018-04-19 17:33:15 My name is Suleiman
I am a Nigerian youth 
I love my country 
I created a job for myself 
I hustle hard to provide for myself
I am also trying to create jobs for my fellow youths 
I don't depended on oil returns

3548 2018-04-19 17:32:56 The morrocan Aragon oil is expensive as hell but it’s so worth it
3549 2018-04-19 17:32:55 China just invested $320 billion into renewable energy by 2020. Volvo will stop  making gas powered cars after 2020.
You know the story behind Whale oil?
3550 2018-04-19 17:32:47 I would start making a peppermint oil spritz for the doorways and windows. I used to have that issue too.
3551 2018-04-19 17:32:43 How can there be a peaceful resolution? Alberta’s economy is hurting and needs the pipeline. While BC says no pipeline, ever! BC is not willing to negotiate period. Any talks are really a stalling effort until the oil companies get frustrated and leave.
3552 2018-04-19 17:32:30 Or go shooting
3553 2018-04-19 17:32:20 I just wish you could have some vape oil in your state. The cartridges, batteries and lanyard neck pouches are super discreet, you can use them in public with little to no odor with most brands,. They're selling 1/4s of outdoor bud this week for $25 up here this week
3554 2018-04-19 17:32:14 ATTN: Sunshine chasers!

3556 2018-04-19 17:32:10 I'd rather see us subsidized the vets, as oil companies, or weapons manufacturers.

3560 2018-04-19 17:31:43 Notice of Intent released today for Arctic Refuge oil lease sales on sacred caribou birthing grounds.

3566 2018-04-19 17:31:20 5 jobs straight women can’t handle-Construction,Auto Mechanic,Heating/Air Conditioning,Steel Worker & Oil Rig Worker. Most likely the main reason why men are paid more. #EqualPay

3568 2018-04-19 17:31:17 Ted is a snake oil salesman.  He made Glen Beck look foolish too. Cannot be trusted. Remember what John Boehner said about him?
3569 2018-04-19 17:31:11 I developed a mild rash so I made mine own poultice of oat milk, coconut oil, honey and avocado oil. Very exciting.
3570 2018-04-19 17:31:06 Tell us if they're are really working under any organization ... Now tell us who's really waiting for oil money 
3571 2018-04-19 17:31:05 I may be mistaken but I thought I heard even the leader of the Green Party in BC said he would accept refined oil coming through the Trans Mountain pipeline.
3572 2018-04-19 17:30:58 Why Is Kinder still using Palm oil in its sweets?????? 
3573 2018-04-19 17:30:57 Here's the thing.  This is GOOD.  Instead of costing the manufacturer a fortune selling them back, they are increasing the demand for production.  Those rifles are already paid for by Dick's.  This is a huge win, not a loss.
3574 2018-04-19 17:30:52 ดีใจมากๆเลยที่ชอบนะคะ 
3575 2018-04-19 17:30:47 If you have an Iceland near you babe, they do to gorgeous flavours in tubs, bubblegum and tiramisu .... totally addictive ..  Oh and Iceland have now stopped using palm oil in their own products yaaaay xxxx

3580 2018-04-19 17:30:32 Dotard Donnie thinks he's really doing something and that it's all about him.  Russia has been supplying NK oil. They are laughing at DJT!

3585 2018-04-19 17:30:13 Have you ever tried coconut oil
on your toast it comes in solid form
will soften in warmer weather I use 
It on every thing I use to put butter on and I cook with it. It is very good for you.
3586 2018-04-19 17:30:12 Let’s see $100 Oil Baby!
3587 2018-04-19 17:30:11 人生中很多事機會只有一次‧
厲志話通常會說，機會永遠都存在
世事無絕對，人生是自己的，走到最後的人，臉上也未必有笑容
3588 2018-04-19 17:30:06 Also sometimes I can be found in the bathroom at work literally patting my face down with blue roll so nothing is 100% oil proof but it’s by far the best. At least it doesn’t slide off like most tbh.
3589 2018-04-19 17:30:06 One dances - not quite an elixir but better than snake oil.
3590 2018-04-19 17:30:02 I was going to go with TWSS, but it didn't quite work. The media keeps trying to make gender politics difficult, but when it comes down to it, drunken rollercoaster riding is the way to any worthwhile girl's heart.
3591 2018-04-19 17:29:51 About 20 years ago, a doctor told me that pasta is not a problem for weight because it takes more energy to digest it than is in the pasta. He said the problem is what is added to or on the pasta. I eat pasta every day w olive oil & grated parmesan. No weight gain.
3592 2018-04-19 17:29:47 now i do is vegetable oil when she
3593 2018-04-19 17:29:37 Hmmm... Is there oil we can drill for in the superfund site? Asking for a friend...

3595 2018-04-19 17:29:28 ぽやしみます
3596 2018-04-19 17:29:27 Dear @realDonaldTrump, seems like last time oil prices soared from $2-3 dollars was when an oil man was president like #GeorgeBush! Can’t help but think it’s because you’re an oil man?
3597 2018-04-19 17:29:17 @ShankerASingham is harming the national interest with his snake oil.
3598 2018-04-19 17:29:04 You want to ignore the "most" in the tweet like some people are ignoring the "alot" in Buhari's yesterday statement. I'm not generalising. Rather I said most. And even Saudi will still be OK with their Gold and tourism. And Russia don't depend solely on Oil.

3606 2018-04-19 17:28:27 For those of us who did use of English in our 1st degree will understand PMB's statement was referring to youths who haven't gone to school or make any effort but sit down at home expecting freebies cuz they are from oil producing nation and the word "lazy youth " was never use
3607 2018-04-19 17:28:19 I come with that done too but they braid and install it. Now if sis out here charging over $120 to install weave, she better wash, dry, oil, trim ends, and braid my hair. Cause I swear these $45-$60 sew ins last the same amount of time as a $100 one.
3608 2018-04-19 17:28:19 Oil/gas=GREED!

3610 2018-04-19 17:28:09 French is correct. 
These books are covered by the first amendment in precisely the way a snake oil salesmen can claim to cure blindness and gout with his miracle tonic.
3611 2018-04-19 17:28:06 Just going to come up to the oil shop more often they make you feel like a goddess over here! 
3612 2018-04-19 17:28:01 おわ〜

3614 2018-04-19 17:27:43 “Let me spray this oil all over your face Sam”
3615 2018-04-19 17:27:43 It's your splash guard. Stop at a oil change place to have it secured. Valvoline usually will do it free of charge.
3616 2018-04-19 17:27:39 You mean allowing any large corporation (especially oil, gas & coal) to freely pollute and poison water supplies and destroy public lands if they can make a quick buck? Yes, that is really mega mega!
3617 2018-04-19 17:27:38 2-that Nigeria has been an oil producing country, therefore they should sit and do nothing and get housing, healthcare and education free.”

3621 2018-04-19 17:27:15 From SCC today: "...to require full economic integration would significantly undermine  the shape of Canadian federalism, which is built upon regional diversity within a single nation". From beer to oil. #TransMountain #kindermorgan #comeau
3622 2018-04-19 17:27:08 I want him to keep young water clean of pollution, food free from pesticides and cancerogens, keep birds from being killed by oil spills, and mountains destroyed by coal companies. I want him to serve this nation and protect our natural resources. That's his job description
3623 2018-04-19 17:27:07 Once oil runs out in Arab countries they will be useless. Their people don’t produce anything of value. The only thing of value they give to the rest of the world is the natural resources from the land.
3624 2018-04-19 17:27:03 What a useless argument. The price of oil today is more than it was in September. If they wanted to back out due to economic validity they would have done so at first opportunity in September at the first delay. FYI Suncor and Teck have both applied for Oil Sands projects.

3628 2018-04-19 17:26:49 Looks like it might be the oil pan cover panel?  Same thing happened to my VW Jetta a few years ago.  The bolts that held it in place rusted and broke.
3629 2018-04-19 17:26:48 I had a similar experience the other day, so I treated myself to an MOT...

The car, I mean. I wouldn’t pass an MOT with all this oil leaking.
3630 2018-04-19 17:26:46 ...or that other crimes exist besides murder.
3631 2018-04-19 17:26:46 I get it, you view Lucic as being completely washed up but I think he's a yr or two away from reaching that spot.

3644 2018-04-19 17:25:47 “I can’t wait to get my oil change” said no one ever
3645 2018-04-19 17:25:26 Same. For that, I always have my laptop bag. It’s not as easy a draw as on body, but hey, I got it at least.
3646 2018-04-19 17:25:16 Try the tea tee oil range or seaweed range in body shop
3647 2018-04-19 17:25:15 For those of us who did use of English in our 1st degree will understand PMB's statement was referring to youths who haven't gone to school or make any effort but sit down at home expecting freebies cuz they are from oil producing nation and the word "lazy youth " was never use
3648 2018-04-19 17:25:11 Of course he is and Lucic was awful this year but don't think he's that bad. Lack of confidence made him even worse. As far as replacing him in the T6 goes, if they find one great but at the moment, there isn't one.
3649 2018-04-19 17:25:00 $Saudi's $80/b vs. #Iran/#Oman's $60/b: Depends how you see the future of Iran #oil export & conflicts in Yemen and Syria!

3655 2018-04-19 17:24:08 It's so silly. They are making shit up. The whole business case from KM was proposed when oil was 100-150 a barrel and now it's 60. They are playing the feds and Alberta and if we use 2bil in taxpayer money, we will just be throwing it away.
3656 2018-04-19 17:24:05 Wait is palm oil a good thing for the planet or a bad thing, I'm sorry I'm confused
3657 2018-04-19 17:24:01 Anyone selling their oil spill ticket??? #tsu21 #tsu20 #tsu19 #tsu18
3658 2018-04-19 17:24:01 @POTUS @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr you must coordinate with Governors to make sure they don’t raise gas  tax as WTI Crude Oil is heading back to $90-$100Bbl which will eat into 𝐓𝐚𝐱 Cuts benefit.

3661 2018-04-19 17:23:46 Somebody just sent me an email that was so dumb! I read it 3 times trying to understand the point. 

I think if I see them I’d chase them. Literally chase them in the streets and wipe dem dung wid olive oil. 

My assistant had to respond because I was...
3662 2018-04-19 17:23:43 Indeed. Im in a situation where I can't exactly carry on body at work, so I keep my piece in my briefcase. Anywhere else I carry on body.
3663 2018-04-19 17:23:29 Coconut oil ?
3664 2018-04-19 17:23:26 I need to be in some sun and tanning oil already. Summer isn’t ready for me.
3665 2018-04-19 17:23:25 Wait, where's the Good Olive Oil?
3666 2018-04-19 17:23:21 The Hellespont Alhambra has a carrying capacity for 3,166,353 ballers of oil.
3667 2018-04-19 17:23:17 Youth to the people just released a DOPE beauty oil
3668 2018-04-19 17:23:10 onions, paprika, terragon, olive oil and pizza seasoning included in the stuffing content.
Stuffed tomatoes with a bird or tuna gardener salad.
A fried milanesa covered with tomato sauce and nothing else, accompanied with french fries.
3669 2018-04-19 17:23:00 Michael smell like olive oil
3670 2018-04-19 17:23:00 It's essentially vegetables with croutons and an oil based dressing, so yeah.
3671 2018-04-19 17:22:51 The coconut oil is fucking unreal man. I'm cooking with it and putting it in coffee the whole time hahaha
3672 2018-04-19 17:22:51 looks like he got trapped shorting oil at 60s.. haha.
3673 2018-04-19 17:22:43 See lazy Nigerians doing nothing waiting for oil money.

3677 2018-04-19 17:21:56 Because it’s funded by the Roundtable on sustainable palm oil who are funded and run by big palm oil producers like wilmar et al who have oodles of money to spend to defend their making more money from deforestation #saynotopalmoil #palmoilkills

3698 2018-04-19 17:20:33 Virgin olive oil is the first pressing of olives, the purest & sweetest. It's the FIRSTFRUIT, coming before all others.

3702 2018-04-19 17:20:01 I love organic freshly made peanut butter.  Less oil, more crunchiness.  It's the best.
3703 2018-04-19 17:19:52 I’ve never been urged to take fish oil supplements by my GP. I’ve heard a varied diet (real food) was the best way to go for most folks. Can you really even trust supplements? Are they even regulated?
3704 2018-04-19 17:19:50 @DeleMomodu - in the country where this statement was made! Every child born is entitled to child benefit whiles the mother and father entitled to tax credit based on income.

3706 2018-04-19 17:19:45 Another gift from Trump was realized today when I read that Saudi Arabia and Russia had agreed to drop their supply of oil and create a shortage. Now we know why gas has gone up lately. Trump and his buddies have done it again. Now everything else will follow and go up!
3707 2018-04-19 17:19:36 Hell yes! I hope that your entire country will block oil exports from Canada through the United States too! Please idle and remove the 17 oil and gas pipelines that Canada pimps through America's towns and ecosystems, defiling our nation's environments and communities. Get Out!
3708 2018-04-19 17:19:26 Wow, I guess my random lazy cooking can turn out to be a hit; sliced beef, spinach, spring onions, soy sauce and sesame oil. So easy & good! Why haven't I done this before?!?

3720 2018-04-19 17:18:47 Congratulations to Dr. Dan Houser, who successfully defended his PhD in Anthropology this morning. Dan's dissertation was entitled, "Feeding the Wrong Wolf: Work, Gender, and Generosity in a Northern Alberta Oil and Gas Community."
3721 2018-04-19 17:18:32 Yeah I can't imagine Doughty is too happy today, that's the problem with setting a precedent and not staying consistent. Tough job, but in my opinion they got it wrong for Doughty and right for Kucherov. Which I guess is wrong overall lol
3722 2018-04-19 17:18:01 I also suggest getting to know lentils of any kind. Slow cook chopped onions in a fat, boil lentils in salt water, add some tomato paste and spices to the onion/oil, then fry the lentils in that. Add liquid (water, chicken stock, a little milk or cream) and you got curry.
3723 2018-04-19 17:17:52 Wow my oil change was stupid quick so like do i go back to work or say fuck it?

3726 2018-04-19 17:17:39 Want to know the best indicator that @realDonaldTrump is #MAGA?

Look no further than higher oil/gas prices and the growing US domination of the production markets.

It's not the best news to hear, but it's a great indicator of how well the economy is doing.
3727 2018-04-19 17:17:39 If syria did not have rich Gas or Oil reserves then nobody would actually care what goes on in syria .

3748 2018-04-19 17:16:04 I have no words for this society.

As my son reminds me often, the squeaky wheel gets the oil.
The louder and ruder you are....the world falls at your feet!
3749 2018-04-19 17:16:01 Sorry.  I was taking you literally as in Hubbert pushing a scam. In the 90's I couldn't get reserves booked on 8% porosity rock. Now, that is considered to be conventional reservoir.
Personally, I wouldn't talk about peak oil now. But, oil isn't infinite...
3750 2018-04-19 17:16:01 Love this. Thank you for posting and for pouring oil on the troubled waters of the #Timeless / #Lyatt fandom. Can't wait for Sunday!
3751 2018-04-19 17:16:01 Sir, you are absolutely correct. One of the lazy Nigerian youth who is enjoying free oil money had an accident with the power bike he bought with free oil money not too long ago, and he was flown abroad for treatment with free oil money.
3752 2018-04-19 17:15:58 Maybe, but if there’s any type of seal, there’s a risk oil based products on the face can ignite-from what I understand.
3753 2018-04-19 17:15:35 The irony of the PM saying medicines need to be “tested properly”! If we legalised it, the oil would be put through standard pharmaceutical testings. So what is the problem? 
3754 2018-04-19 17:15:33 Let’s get some baby oil and cheap highlight and make a knockoff body lava

3756 2018-04-19 17:15:14 this isn't how it actually works tho.  gauge of the needle often depends on the type of injection being administered. for example, we use the 29G needle to administer a PPD skin test. when i was getting progesterone shots, it NEEDED that 18G needle, b/c it was an oil suspension

3766 2018-04-19 17:14:41 Mebbe. I could make a peace offering of that new year-round motor oil and see if it appeases.

3777 2018-04-19 17:13:40 I think Mr President myopic view of Nigerian youth was restricted to the North. As a lot of them didn't go to school and believe the country is an oil producing country with their own at hems of affairs #LazyNigerianYouths

3787 2018-04-19 17:12:59 Did you know that methane pollution is mainly caused as a dangerous byproduct of the oil and gas industry? #cutmethane
3788 2018-04-19 17:12:51 I don’t think it’s as widespread. Most people aren’t putting washing machines, motor oil and diapers in the recycling. Municipal recycling is many years behind the larger world of things that can be recycled. It’s not set up to fail, it’s just old technology

3790 2018-04-19 17:12:48 It's a curse because @MBuhari generation made it so

Norway is an oil producing nation and they are different on every social and economic indicator of development

3792 2018-04-19 17:12:35 Three months ago Trump said that he was prostituting our land in order to decrease our dependency on foreign oil.  Yesterday he says he has made some "great deals" on foreign oil.  I guess the Koch's have instructed him on what position to take.
3793 2018-04-19 17:12:10 ECONOMIC INDICATORS: 19 April @ 18:00 
The dollar is trading at R11,94, the euro at R14,76 and the British pound at R16,98. Gold is selling at $1343,92 a fine ounce and Brent crude oil is quoted at $74,44 a barrel.

3794 2018-04-19 17:11:53 Small minded people are those who don’t see a hypocritical snake oil salesman getting you all riled about about the EVIL EU while quietly getting his kids EU German passports. Nigel obviously wants to keep their options open while closing ours. That’s a textbook case of hypocrisy
3795 2018-04-19 17:11:51 Maybe a rising oil price will help Russia a bit. If the USA can't bomb a country they will use sanctions to do the damage. As things are right now, it is hard to not get hurt if the USA want to damage your country.
3796 2018-04-19 17:11:49 I am with you @levinepmc @marketcall on the oil issue .You named it perfectly,it is a debacle.@bnn

3798 2018-04-19 17:11:41 Ziza lee. Your next beard oil should be called "Connect". Don't say I never did nothing for you.

3800 2018-04-19 17:11:06 think that's what traders were betting on. Geopoiltical tensions seem to have little to do with oils continued rise looking at what's happened to equiteis since Syria eneded. $100 oil today will be worse off on an indebtetd consumer than the last time I suspect.
3801 2018-04-19 17:11:04 What about $99.99 oil?
3802 2018-04-19 17:11:02 Yes. I have a very small stomach due to stomach cancer. This time, had pasta with olive oil. 

Have a very sensitive stomach.

3809 2018-04-19 17:10:26 Maybe its because students and Millennials will be the ones who suffer in 30-50 yrs time and they want change, as opposed to the old GOP who are sucking on the teats of the oil/gas businesses will be dead by then, but would have died rich.
3810 2018-04-19 17:10:25 questions for you if i may 
1- with eurochf trading at 1.20 , would it put major pressure on the euro

3822 2018-04-19 17:09:18 Wrong! The issue is do we let shills like you keep muddying the waters for big oil or do we realize that, just like acid rain, DDT and burning rivers, we are the cause and must act decisively now for future generations. The earth > your IRA

3829 2018-04-19 17:08:26 My question is that if Clove Oil is supposed to kill pests, why do they need to spray clove trees for pests?
3830 2018-04-19 17:08:25 I've said this before and I will continue to say. Oil is a Curse to most of it producing countries. Venezuela, Iran, Nigeria, Angola. Etc. It's more of a curse than a blessing
3831 2018-04-19 17:08:23 No what looks bad is America’s inability to solve systemic racism and capitalist exploitation. What looks bad is Pigs executing unarmed black men in the streets. What looks bad is Pigs firing water cannons at indigenous people so an oil company can profit off of climate disaster.

3836 2018-04-19 17:07:48 The risks and consequences are very different for products carried. collisions risk loss of fuel from freighters and direct loss from takers. Other products while harmful have far less impact in the long term than an oil spill. You are correct, this is about risk acceptance.

3850 2018-04-19 17:06:31 They say Argan oil is the solution to almost everything 
3851 2018-04-19 17:06:18 I think you're being a bit harsh in calling Peak Oil a scam. It was a theory from 1956. At that time large, easy to produce reservoirs like Leduc were economic. I started in the early 90's. Then rocks at 8% porosity were uneconomic and "non-reservoir". Shale wasn't even a dream.
3852 2018-04-19 17:06:15 That's true, she copied the questions from elsewhere if I recall correctly.
3853 2018-04-19 17:06:13 But some people like engine oil.
3854 2018-04-19 17:06:11 I feel same way. It isn't worth it to me, to change my own Oil for $30 saving. My time was paid higher than that in my lowest paid job. I get dirty, have waste-oil to dispose of. But at $50, I'll do it myself. Actually takes 15 min, 30 with cleanup. Reasonable priced are busiest
3855 2018-04-19 17:06:09 From another Perspective- I think the President didn't want to mention the 5% from Chatham house. But his statement could hv been referring to the "Militants" the the Amnesty programme. 

Most Youths from the south west/North/Southeast etc dont quite feel Entitled to Oil Money.
3856 2018-04-19 17:06:01 Come to think of it, what's the usefulness of a state who exploits oil and can't make life easy for its citizens.
3857 2018-04-19 17:05:59 They are good for tires but would never go for oil change.
3858 2018-04-19 17:05:45 Yes, but Oil will dump with stocks this Fall imho, like it did post 2007 and 2000, Gold to a lesser extent if at all. They will both soar together afterwards when the Fed and global CBs turn on the monetary spigots again imho: "hard assets".
3859 2018-04-19 17:05:40 Which one are you selling to mining and oil companies this week? Guess we need to go there first before they're smaller and polluted.

3915 2018-04-19 17:00:39 I just bought the coconut oil soap bar and it’s AH-mazing! I’m a huge fan of your products, and they are ‘clean’!. I especially love the charcoal detox bath wash  .. Keep them coming!
3916 2018-04-19 17:00:36 Ted who?
53 % Of Texans don't know enough about Beto O'Rourke to form an opinion, so let's change that. @BetoORourke Dem U.S. Rep of Texas' 16th district is an occasional member of Los Diablitos de El Paso sandlot baseball team w/great ideas for energy jobs.Texas is gas and oil,

3920 2018-04-19 17:00:27 Here are some helpful sleep treatments...Cannabis oil  - Cannabinoid- plants are among the most effective treatments not only for disorders of the nervous system but also for sleep disorders known. This includes intractable insomnia.
3921 2018-04-19 17:00:25 @WhatsOnWorcs Come see works by Ylenia Mino at her #artopening this Wednesday. The opening features her Italian oil paintings which will be on display at the Edward Jones Office of James Normington.

3925 2018-04-19 17:00:05 I have heard a lot of people say that the USA only goes to war for the greed of oil, like the invasion of Kuwait. What a shame no one stopped the invasion of the Rhineland.
3926 2018-04-19 17:00:05 “More than 60 percent of our population is below 30, a lot of them haven’t been to school and they are claiming that Nigeria is an oil producing country, therefore, they should sit and do nothing, and get housing, healthcare, education free.”

-PMB
The real PMB STATEMENT
3927 2018-04-19 17:00:02 vitamin c serum is a staple in my skincare regimen! if you're into it you should try avocado oil, jojoba oil, and/or rosehip oil. all great for skin + scarring
3928 2018-04-19 16:59:54 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
3929 2018-04-19 16:59:54 So...... You're 100% committed to stopping oil development in the Artic Refuge (as you should be), but you're also 100% OK with adding hundreds of millions of people to the US through mass immigration?  You should be against both!
3930 2018-04-19 16:59:51 Manipulation is the only reason why oil isn’t <$20 right now.
3931 2018-04-19 16:59:48 In just finishing up my credentials for Forks Over Knives Plant based cooking class without dairy or oil ! Wow ! It’s been awesome cooking fabulously healthy foods over the last three months !! Here’s just a few of my submissions !!! Lol

3935 2018-04-19 16:59:27 What’s the cost of supplying Saudi Arabia with US Arms To fight in the Yemeni civil war

Besides killing civilian women and children

Increase the price of oil to pay for war

Pump price Shock

Someone’s got to pay for the carnage
3936 2018-04-19 16:59:21 Do not use Cannabis oil if it was made with Naphtha.
3937 2018-04-19 16:59:20 @AMEXHI_Oficial ignored defects in the design of the oil reform, such as the inability to subdivide a lease block & the use of polygons.
3938 2018-04-19 16:59:20 Ha ha. You morons can't invent nothing but shit. All you do is terror acts and murder one another. You haven't contribute anything to humanity. If it wasn't for oil, which you also don't know to produce, you would be still living in the middle ages.
3939 2018-04-19 16:59:17 私もoil paint flat brushメインで塗ってるので20枚くらい壁越えればマイタケさんのレベルに近づけるんではないかと思うと希望がわきました、いつもかっこいいイラストありがとうございます！
3940 2018-04-19 16:59:12 Is this the same and one brand as Cafe Javas in UG ( opp Acacia Mall, City Oil on Mbombo rd, etc)? Love the ambiance, the good food and service!
3941 2018-04-19 16:59:11 The pipeline company is not selling the resource, it is selling the transportation of the resource, just like the railroad company doesn’t own the oil that they transport to the B.C. coast.

3945 2018-04-19 16:58:57 We can each have a resource that someone else needs. I mean Jed was just out back shooting rabbits when he hit oil. Look at them now. Living in Beverly Hills. Being one percentiles. 
3946 2018-04-19 16:58:49 Oil boy required?.
3947 2018-04-19 16:58:46 it doesn't seem logical that the S&P should be positively correlated to oil prices--so it is more likely that both records are correlated to the same thing--inflation.
3948 2018-04-19 16:58:46 I had once thought oil may never reach 100 Usd again
3949 2018-04-19 16:58:44 Worth it, if painted in oil, from life. Fine artists who can do a realistic portrait are not common these days. Kudos to Paul Newton.
3950 2018-04-19 16:58:43 and Rupert Murdoch, Jacob Rothschild and Richard Cheney of Genie oil obviously have you in their pockets
3951 2018-04-19 16:58:28 Oman Oil Min: Does Not Think Oil Cuts Deal Is Mission Accomplished 
Oman Oil Minister Says Would Like To See Opec, Non-Opec Supply Cut Agreement Continue Until End Of Year
3952 2018-04-19 16:58:14 some guy @ autozone sat & watched me put oil in my car & said “wow I didn’t think u could actually do it, good girl” yep ok thx Frank bye
3953 2018-04-19 16:58:02 Hahahaaha. Dulu aku keje oil and gas. Tu mcm gelap sikit
3954 2018-04-19 16:57:49 Getting oil change and then buying some mulch .... way too much adulting today
3955 2018-04-19 16:57:45 I just use head and shoulders conditioning shampoo and conditioner and I use I think it’s the designline leave in conditioner and then Moroccan argon oil when my hair is damp, and just on the ends
3956 2018-04-19 16:57:35 not bothering any other oil stock
3957 2018-04-19 16:57:30 HOW TO PREVENT IT ; 
— pre-wash moisturizer 
— vitamins
— oils (castor oil, almond oil, etc)
— sulfate free shampoos & hydrating conditioners
— use a brush that is right for your hair and be gentle
— avoid heat and chemicals. trim hair when needed
3958 2018-04-19 16:57:29 Exactly. They are going to lose money, lose customers, they won’t save a single life — all to virtue signal to Leftists who don’t really shop there much.
3959 2018-04-19 16:57:27 They have no choice and I still believe he would be fine w/ Leon if they can find another useful winger.
3960 2018-04-19 16:57:19 I was just talking to my friend about this. I won’t get an oil change if there is a line, will  leave restaurants that have long waits, etc.
3961 2018-04-19 16:57:17 Any mention of square mileage to them would cause a cerebral hemorrhage.
3962 2018-04-19 16:57:15 Oman oil min says 65-75 dollars is a realistic range for oil prices #OOTT
3963 2018-04-19 16:57:13 I remember those days!  Sorta...
3964 2018-04-19 16:57:07 Saudi Arabia wants price of oil at or above 75.00 a barrel to fund it's war in Yemen, via WSJ. 
Billions of ameeican taxpayer dollars have been spent protecting these assholes.
3965 2018-04-19 16:57:03 @TacticalDigs @JourdynBerry @thejeffvibbert in Texas we have the trifecta. Cheese (normal and jalapeño), marinara, and olive oil with herbs. Let’s go cuzzos
3966 2018-04-19 16:57:00 How does a Presidential Candidate like Killary swear to destroy the coal mining, oil and steel industries then go into those areas demanding votes?!?
3967 2018-04-19 16:56:54 Oil company wanting money is the only thing I wasn't confused about.

I just don't know what memes you want. What memes do you want Chuck
3968 2018-04-19 16:56:53 He looks like he smells like patchouli oil!
3969 2018-04-19 16:56:43 I need an oil change 
3970 2018-04-19 16:56:41 Carrot oil was a daft idea
3971 2018-04-19 16:56:35 There's not much room for immaturity when you're a seething vessel of hate.
3972 2018-04-19 16:56:27 Oman oil min says the JMMC doesn't have the mandate to discuss future opec / non opec deals #OOTT
3973 2018-04-19 16:56:24 The team has been hard at work this week making repairs to the ABRacingForTime #86 and will be back @PortRoyalSpdway this weekend to compete against the Lucas Oil Late Models on Sunday, April 22nd.  See you there!
3974 2018-04-19 16:56:23 I doubt if some do. 1 dispatch rider stained my document with oil
Another 1 didn't deliver all d goods to a client
Another spilled my food
Some riders smell of alcohol

3978 2018-04-19 16:56:05 as @WST73 often points out, oil prices rising, interest rates rising, debt levels at all-time highs - it won't take much for the first cracks to form
3979 2018-04-19 16:56:03 Are we voting for oil companies?
3980 2018-04-19 16:55:59 Money money money money! Shame the people with all the oil, buy my green energy 80% less efficient, but hey carbon shaming amir
3981 2018-04-19 16:55:58 Where the oil

3983 2018-04-19 16:55:34 Hey @JustinTrudeau, do you really want to go down in history as #JustinCrudeau? Do the right thing & don't build new oil pipelines. The world is watching. #StopKM #StopPipelines
3984 2018-04-19 16:55:32 The thing is, he's no oil painting himself!
3985 2018-04-19 16:55:29 Full capacity??? KE stop lying you pathetic bastards. NEPRA has declared in it's report that K-Electric has not been using their oil furnace based units to their full capacity. You people are liars and you should be held accounted for all the deaths in recent years by Court.
3986 2018-04-19 16:55:27 Salt and vinegar, oil and pepper.  #whoops

3992 2018-04-19 16:54:46 Will the Putin mobile require the mixing of gasoline and 2 cycle oil?
3993 2018-04-19 16:54:42 Bon alors on oublie tarzan bou et on prend Midnight Oil ?
3994 2018-04-19 16:54:37 yeah that's why you have to put oil in a pan and cook the corn tortilla first for a little bit it's BASICS in food preparation
3995 2018-04-19 16:54:31 .@DanielYergin on changes in the US market: We've increased from 6% to 20% in oil production and have become exporters as well. #CGEPevents
3996 2018-04-19 16:54:23 Our president is a freaking monkey terrorist--but instead of a banana, he wants a little Ball of Oil!
3997 2018-04-19 16:54:22 #oil ugh!
3998 2018-04-19 16:54:14 I could never! I already bought all my oil so that base is covered!  I hope you have the stoniest day tomorrow hun!
3999 2018-04-19 16:54:04 Thankful for @KristineJutras for giving me a mental health day Bc I’m sick and really needed an oil change 
4000 2018-04-19 16:54:03 Somali/Canadian Hussen ,whose political campaign was 100 % funded by Liberal Party "funds" is now paying back the Soros anti oil money sources for favours given
4001 2018-04-19 16:54:01 @elonmusk check the oil war between Alberta & BC. $2/L  forecast. Perfect time for push into electric for a province, or Vancouver ;)#Tesla
4002 2018-04-19 16:54:00 arnica oil is my saviour
4003 2018-04-19 16:53:59 The stronger business case is to ship the crude to Gulf coast where refineries have systems in place to handle this poorer quality oil.
4004 2018-04-19 16:53:48 Hahahah I thought oil changes were like $12
4005 2018-04-19 16:53:46 Trying ingesting virgin coconut oil from tonight. Parkinson chalega,Alzheimer nahi.

4007 2018-04-19 16:53:39 Hey, DIY peroxide pals. I used coconut oil on my hair before bleach—my hair feels like silk AND I got it to level 10.  Before I tone, has anyone used the oil during toning as well? @jamielynncrofts @xxLuxeria Thoughts? #hairdye #Platinum #HairCare #hairgoals #platinumgoth
4008 2018-04-19 16:53:37 anyone wanna come w me to get my oil changed
4009 2018-04-19 16:53:36 killing kids for oil wont help them either, who are the western government to decide when they have wmd and a vast chemical arsenal who else should and shouldn't have it? rather arrogant if you ask me, if they really have it that is, I'll refrain from personal insult's =)
4010 2018-04-19 16:53:34 I remember the days i said i would never ever stop smoking and sipping oil  now look at me
4011 2018-04-19 16:53:33 Olive oil is great.  Particularly in salad dressing.
4012 2018-04-19 16:53:30 I’m always like maybe I’ll do natural make up today and will get to the highlighter and get overly excited and walk out of my bathroom looking like an oil slick
4013 2018-04-19 16:53:23 Great to enjoy your presentation today at #PeopleConnect2018 I can't wait to tell the fish oil joke to my team when we get back to @dartmouth
4014 2018-04-19 16:53:10 This story is pure bullshit. Dicks hasn’t stocked an AR since just after Sandy Hook. There is not a single AR platform rifle in their entire inventory. They are destroying nothing. 
It’s all free publicity about virtue signaling.

A perfume oil called forest nymph, rosewater hydrating
4017 2018-04-19 16:52:54 Spoiler alert: That new facial oil you just bought? It’s not a matter of IF you spill it all over the bathroom counter, but when. #thisiswhyIcanthavenicethings
4018 2018-04-19 16:52:50 Two hour wait to get an oil change 
But I refuse to go to raggedy ass jiffy lube

4020 2018-04-19 16:52:38 How does truth and reconciliation work when you silence indigenous voices to allow a Texan oil company to profit? @JustinTrudeau @liberal_party #oppression #nopipeline #KinderMorgan #fundingtexas
4021 2018-04-19 16:52:37 Could be oil got spilled on to the engine and is now burning off because the engine is hot.
4022 2018-04-19 16:52:30 Evangelicals = #FakeChristians  That is why they created a different name other than Catholics who actually follow #Jesus.

4024 2018-04-19 16:52:28 Far more? lol - on the polling on Trudeau taking money to Texas: "sure give the oil companies more of our money" losing out to "wait what...what are you talking about? Billions to a Texan oil industry company? no... what  NO...!?"
4025 2018-04-19 16:52:24 oh fuck no this couple is sitting next to me and the boyfriend says “babe why’s your face so fucking oily?? that’s hella gross fix it. it has more oil than the potatoes i made” WTF???
4026 2018-04-19 16:52:16 Keep those ugly stinking oil riggs off our coast. Have you ever been to the Gulf of Mexico, the whole place smells like an oil refinery. We have a multi-billion dollar tourism industry on the Jersey shore and thats better for locals. Put some friendly wind power off the coast.
4027 2018-04-19 16:52:09 Dada kahit new set nalang ng oil pastel and more bundels of sign pen na majangaz hehe
4028 2018-04-19 16:52:05 @FrazierFarmsMKT Morning! How can I find nutritional facts for your High Energy Muffin? (Whole wheat, eggs, baking powder, almonds, pepitas, cinnamon, salt, canola oil, honey, pineapple, raisin, cranberries, carrots, orange juice)? I'm counting cals and can't find anything online
4029 2018-04-19 16:52:02 Might as well go get an oil change
4030 2018-04-19 16:51:59 Just because oil can create some core inflation and hurt their economy and their vision plan??come on 100 is good..
4031 2018-04-19 16:51:58 GOD = Gold Oil Diamonds
4032 2018-04-19 16:51:46 I am a Vet, I have Neuropathy...cdbg oil sometimes works, but, this disease, you can only treat symptoms...so, any relief is good relief, however minor.
4033 2018-04-19 16:51:45 Look, I just found out that my meibomian gland produces slightly less oil than it's supposed to, so I'm going to need some time to process this. Maybe even a leave of absence.

4035 2018-04-19 16:51:31 You are so out of touch with reality jobs and oil fields in CANADA will save our economy. Not your false fantasy reality go move to Europe do us all a favor. Then our economy will be booming.
4036 2018-04-19 16:51:30 Wilbur Ross direct link. And who bought that 20 per cent stake in Russian oil company?

4038 2018-04-19 16:51:13 How crazy is this country biggest producers of cannabis oil in the world 90 tons last year ,all for medical issues and we export the lot out of our country as illegal hear ...shameless MPs
4039 2018-04-19 16:51:12 What if I tell you Vox doesn't care about facts.
4040 2018-04-19 16:51:04 Finally got my baby an oil change.
4041 2018-04-19 16:51:03 Even the really good areas have seen a significant increase in crime rate. Its a fact. California is a mess.
4042 2018-04-19 16:51:02 Got a primavera olive oil & garlic pasta for lunch. It’s pretty good. But I kinda wish I got the carbonara instead. #Bacon #Cream

4044 2018-04-19 16:50:57 Raw soybean oil may not be terribly unhealthy, but the majority that people consume is oxidized in deep fat fryers and highly pro-inflammatory. If fast food joints returned to using lard in their fryers as they did in the 1960s, it would improve public health.
4045 2018-04-19 16:50:55 I'm a political scientist and holder of Msc without any scholarships from oil money. I'm now a full time farmer and entrepreneur... Sir this is an embarrassment to us #LazyNigerianYouths

4051 2018-04-19 16:50:19 @jatkinz your kind of story! they are listing the names of Kurdish oil tankers to Israel!
4052 2018-04-19 16:50:18 Did you see that shite on the BBC or was it in the mail?
What has snp support got to do with the indy movement?
SNP have HUGE support,as you will see,,,some scots have a backbone,,well 45% do at least.
When the oil is gone WM will kick scots out and say "At least we got the oil"
4053 2018-04-19 16:50:06 This video of this lady putting motor oil on her fish before she frys it is so cringe worthy. Some of the traditions black people pass down 
4054 2018-04-19 16:50:04 I randomly want braids. And I want to wear a sundress. And shimmering body oil. And large mirrored sunglasses.

Summer is upon us.
4055 2018-04-19 16:49:57 QQ Followers! Anyone able to point me to resources related to the merits/benefits of CBT Oil? That scary marijuanases arent legal in TN, but the CBT oil stuff is everywhere, and my Dr said to try it for anxiety...
4056 2018-04-19 16:49:55 ....60% of  population is below 30, Lot of them haven't bn to school, are claiming that  is an oil producing country, therefore they should sit and do nothing and get housing, healthcare, education free....

4066 2018-04-19 16:49:01 Cost of oil per barrel is going up..
4067 2018-04-19 16:48:55 Wonder if i can say oil will hit $80 a barrel even before one thought...who will win OPEC/Russia or the US?
4068 2018-04-19 16:48:47 CBD oil—now legal in my state—seems to be working for me. Admittedly, this is not a double-blind clinical trial or anything but since I started taking it, the aches of pains associated with aging have lessened significantly, as has my consumption of NSAIDS.
4069 2018-04-19 16:48:45 It would take a bigger canvas, and gallons of oil paint!

4076 2018-04-19 16:48:05 Because you ARE smarter than the average bear! I put a thing on my FB page early about wearing pearls for a couple of days...fake ones preferred! Had 'em on for an oil change with jeans & a tee!

4085 2018-04-19 16:47:22 Hi Rab. Don’t fully understand the graph but looks like a huge spike in interest in oil at $80 a barrel. Five times as much as at lower prices
4086 2018-04-19 16:47:17 Many English people do support scots indy,,mostly cos the English press has told them for decades that they subsidise scots,,WM can NEVER admit to little England that scots have propped them up for 40 years

4088 2018-04-19 16:47:10 It’s a good start however most of those are built one way or another using oil. Canada is not the one you should target. Do you think Saudi or Russia’s oil fields are cleaner? Fact is the world still needs oil.

4135 2018-04-19 16:42:45 Hey @JustinTrudeau, do you really want to go down in history as #JustinCrudeau? Do the right thing & don't build new oil pipelines. The world is watching. #StopKM #StopPipelines
4136 2018-04-19 16:42:39 He said becos nigeria is an oil producing nation "therefore the youths think they shuld sit and do nothing" didn't call anyone lazy IMO
4137 2018-04-19 16:42:33 Exactly. The business case for expanding the oil sands is extremely weak. The environmental argument against expansion is very strong. But we have to pretend the business case justifies the environmental costs. It doesn't. Even with a $100 carbon tax.

4140 2018-04-19 16:42:22 Thoughts from an oil lube waiting room: Just because I don’t want to change my own oil doesn’t mean I don’t know how long it takes to do it. Longer I wait, the less likely I am to ever come back.
4141 2018-04-19 16:42:22 BS, he just realized that oil prices won’t go back to pre-2013 levels, so he needs one last welfare cheque.

4144 2018-04-19 16:41:57 This is a huge argument that many anti-pipeline seem to ignore. They want all these social programs but don't understand how funding works. They also want alternatives now but fail to understand that you need oil to get off oil for r&d. They just expect things to happen, somehow.

4150 2018-04-19 16:41:47 Ah, well I meant just the tomato pieces & oil with the herbs. I like ketchup and bbq but I consider them more of a sauce than a spread. You should definitely look up sriracha (not sure if it is available in Italy) and horseradish! I love spicy food and those spreads are gr8.

4158 2018-04-19 16:41:01 That entire story is oil-dependent rooted .. It's moot to the discussion that we need to work on phasing out oil and finding better options .. No one is talking about flipping a switch from one to the other (except Scheer's initial at Trudeau at the very top of this thread) ..
4159 2018-04-19 16:40:38 You are crazy. Drinking bottled water? Breathing fresh air? No oil on your beach or garbage? For how long before your privilege doesn’t guarantee this? Not long probably unless you have an epiphany, wake up to saving the earth and people’s health.

4194 2018-04-19 16:36:55 Reminding him he's no oil painting either 
4195 2018-04-19 16:36:53 I will add...The renewable energy sector could be a huge industry if the Government were willing to subsidize it like they do Big Oil and Coal. Subsidies are meant for struggling companies, not monoliths. We could easily manufacture Solar Panels/wind turbines here
4196 2018-04-19 16:36:45 WTI oil at $69.31/barrel, +$0.84.
4197 2018-04-19 16:36:41 Yes! It's just so sane to allow mining waste to be dumped into water. It's so sane to cut back on car emissions regulations so we can kill people with dirty air. Open public lands for mining and drilling! Open up the coastlines to oil rigs. In short, your comment is ridiculous.

4212 2018-04-19 16:35:29 I read the book while pregnant & loved it. But none of the snake oil in this book works for children with actual reflux -- which is what colic is. After trying to swaddle, and calm my miserable refluxing baby with a vacuum, I turned to actual experts, like a pediatric GI doc.
4213 2018-04-19 16:35:16 Y u relying on gas when u have an agreement to produce electricity on furnace oil. Also if u producing electricity on gas y r u then charging nation prices of furnace oil production. Totally profit making organisation no moral or ethic ms
4214 2018-04-19 16:35:15 I take it you didn't read the column? No interest in lower SAGD SORs as a result of substituting solvent for steam? No interest in paraffinic froth treatment? No interest in the fact that no other heavy crude oil producing jurisdiction is de-carbonizing its oil?

4227 2018-04-19 16:34:11 AP: Trump admin moves toward oil & gas drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Notice Friday in Federal Register starts 60-day review to sell oil/ gas leases in ANWR. Opening remote refuge to drilling is longtime GOP priority that most Democrats fiercely oppose.
4228 2018-04-19 16:34:00 Ottawa will sacrifice the western grain and oil producers just to pacify @CanadianPacific union votes. Where is our domestic leadership? Our pipelines are stuck and 1/2 of our rail shipping is next #wethewest
4229 2018-04-19 16:33:58 I was waiting for a parking spot on campus and this total ass stood with his driver door open for 3 minutes while on his phone, check HIS OIL, added MORE oil, stood there on his phone some more, and then waved at me and said “never mind I don’t think I’m going to leave”
4230 2018-04-19 16:33:55 Nah man I'm good I had to cut back on some of them cause something was burning so I still have plenty of the oil
4231 2018-04-19 16:33:36 Is the U.S. Shale Boom Hitting a Bottleneck?

Apr.18 (Dow Jones) -- The oil field at the heart of the U.S. shale boom appears to be choking on its own growth, a surprising development with big ramifications for energy profits and global markets.
4232 2018-04-19 16:33:28 No fan of Trump, May, Saudi leader, Netanyahu and Assad. It's always about oil. What right have the West got to bomb other countries, and create instability. The world would be a better place, if not for Saudi and Israeli buying favours with their money.
4233 2018-04-19 16:33:17 What is the benefit of the oil, if it is only to provide Mr President free medical bills for 160 days in a London hospital and I a Nigerian should not enjoy the benefit of thesame oil money. All of you guys supporting this wickedness is evil.#LazyNigerianYouths
4234 2018-04-19 16:33:09 Data is the new crude oil.. Strathmore business school. @LiquidTelecomKe
4235 2018-04-19 16:33:09 The combination of advanced hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, employing cutting-edge technologies, is mostly responsible for surging U.S. oil and natural gas production. Its for both!
4236 2018-04-19 16:33:03 Shell is planning to invest $20 billion in the Nigerian oil sector. This was revealed at the CHOGM business forum.

It’s unfortunate that this has not made news headlines. Rather, the president was misquoted by the media to have insulted the youths of Nigeria. SMH.

4239 2018-04-19 16:32:45 More than 60 per cent of the population is below 30, a lot of them haven’t been to school and they are claiming that Nigeria is an oil producing country, therefore, they should sit and do nothing, and get housing, healthcare, education free,
4240 2018-04-19 16:32:42 Look back a few years at prices that were ridiculous. There is absolutely no reason for high oil and gas prices in the USA like they were then and certainly not now. Our POTUS could take care of much more if the morons in our govt weren’t constantly playing their demonic games.

4243 2018-04-19 16:32:32 My BS theory is pent-up selling demand for Treasuries, which rallied as oil spiked on geopol risk before.

4245 2018-04-19 16:32:18 Because Republicans are not *really* pro-life. They are tricksters and con-men who exploit the ignorant to vote against their own best interests. They’re too busy selling snake oil to MI to help them at all.

4324 2018-04-19 16:25:04 A client just broke my heart, crying in pain and frustration bc CBD oil is the only thing that helps several of his illnesses including chronic seizures w out the cruel sideffects that Rx generates.

4328 2018-04-19 16:24:43 Some oil producing countries where they hide their assets and stolen funds ,provide that for their citizens, why can’t it happen in NGR if that was the case ?
4329 2018-04-19 16:24:32 My mom takes cbd oil as well. She had back arthritis and it has helped her sleep through the night!! I may start taking it myself soon for my tendinitis and bad knee.

4331 2018-04-19 16:24:16 See the lazy Nigerians youth doing nothing waiting for oil money.....
4332 2018-04-19 16:24:15 Yo ya is yo-yo.castor oil of debates...
4333 2018-04-19 16:24:01 Affordable and great education, Business start up and drastic reductions on exports(closing illegal markets), stop to oil production and concentrate on other industries
4334 2018-04-19 16:23:35 5th Division of the 19th Army of PLA "The Oil Corps" is the progenitor of the Chinese Oil and Gas Industry-so, would be of immense interest.
4335 2018-04-19 16:23:33 @jimcramer Mr Cramer what do you thinking about the oil Market is it Pump and Dump? thanks

4336 2018-04-19 16:23:31 "A lot of them haven't been to school, and they are claiming, you know, that Nigeria has been an oil producing country therefore, they should sit and do nothing, and get housing, healthcare, education, free..."
4337 2018-04-19 16:23:30 So, the knight-commander... Boiling in oil? That one never gets old.
4338 2018-04-19 16:23:30 MHA Hutchings “was the decision to transfer $20m for exploration work to nalcor the result of the CEO of Nalcor cutting $20m from the oil and gas exploration fund?” #nlpoli
4339 2018-04-19 16:23:18 @mrbinnion How is it possible to use so long time to make a oil and gas regulations in quebec ?. The oil and gas makes good economy and good for the klimate with clean gas
4340 2018-04-19 16:23:17 O you noticed the obvious pro oil slant in van/province sun too?
4341 2018-04-19 16:23:17 You all on twitter you ain’t getting no mf oil change
4342 2018-04-19 16:23:13 I love summer weather, the heat, the alcohol, the BBQs, the children crying because they've fallen and can't take their oil, wonderful

4346 2018-04-19 16:23:06 Ask him why Ontario a heat their homes with US Nat gas. Ask him why my Vespa has to use has refined from offshore oil. Ask him why 50 ppm had to die because there is no east west pipeline. Etc etc etc
4347 2018-04-19 16:23:04 Happy medium, there will alway be a need for oil, trees, fish...It needs to be done responsibly though.  I look at it this way.  I’m from BC and have a swimming pool.  The other provinces want to come for a swim, great! Problem is someone has diarrhea and may shit in my pool.
4348 2018-04-19 16:22:55 Yes honey. My eyelashes always been long but since I put the oil on them they’ve gotta much fuller! I put it on my eyebrows too lol
4349 2018-04-19 16:22:54 If I had 2 billion dollars I'd invest in food forests... end peak oil and global hunger in one move. #ifihad2billiondollars @JustinTrudeau #StopKM

4351 2018-04-19 16:22:51 This one time my character saw a suspicious line of oil and lit it on fire.. she may or may not have blew up the entirety of Luxembourg.
4352 2018-04-19 16:22:50 you must be at Walmart getting an oil change
4353 2018-04-19 16:22:12 My only absolutes are only coconut oil, ghee and a little olive oil now and then and extremely limited grains.
4354 2018-04-19 16:22:09 SO you can carry on with your day as I’ll do mine. I’ve got to get an oil change, run to the bank, buy some new shoes... I know it’s all irrelevant but so is your opinion to me.

4356 2018-04-19 16:22:00 Today is a series of naps between events.

Home at 4am, napped until 7:30am. 8am oil change. Got home at 9am. Napped. 10am Bfast. Got home at 11:15am and napped. Off to lunch; it’s 12:30pm. After lunch: groceries, cook, laundry, nap, then 7pm dinner. Then home by 10pm and sleep.
4357 2018-04-19 16:21:44 @MarcZicree you're totally right. The "science" on Lost in Space is really frustrating. They cannot have a science advisor, or he/she is being ignored. Their fuel is "liquid methane" and looks like crude oil?
4358 2018-04-19 16:21:37 Rose oil is so lovely for your skin. Lavender is a great antibacterial blocker and tea tree (in small amounts) is awesome.

4360 2018-04-19 16:20:59 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @MBuhari is a terrorist. You don’t have to associate with the killer of your own supporters; the Biafrans. It will be the height of evil and ingratitude. He killed thousands and counting. Forget about the oil deal with him. It’s a NO deal. Biafrans own it.

4363 2018-04-19 16:20:41 As disgusting as that High Life commercial was when the guy had the powdered donut and oil all on his hands from working on his car...

I've taken to saying disgusting shit is "just flavor... to a High Life Man" ever since.
4364 2018-04-19 16:20:32 Lavender oil on your pillow or bedding, and less screen time prior to sleeping, especially phone

4368 2018-04-19 16:20:20 How much gold do they have and could they introduce a new gold standard to back their currency ? Maybe China is more likely to be first. We are already seeing oil priced in Yuan.
4369 2018-04-19 16:20:15 @jjhorgan It seems totally hypocritical of you to oppose the pipeline and yet demand that Alberta supply oil to B.C.  Do you really think shipping oil via rail or trucks is better for the environment?  Stop your political posturing and do what's right for Canada's economy!
4370 2018-04-19 16:20:12 What if it’s for his gfs cat orrrrr to use as oil dry!
4371 2018-04-19 16:20:07 My lil flimsy hair chile I'da been splattered all over the ocean rocks  AND I oil my braids... so yea  no
4372 2018-04-19 16:20:07 Didn't see anything offensive on the statement by PMB that some youth  want Nigeria to feed,cloth & build houses for them without working bc Nigeria is blessed with crude oil resources.The fact is that youth all over the country have this wrong notion of earning without working
4373 2018-04-19 16:20:03 Alberta taking Chinese money to ship oil to China.  Bc taking American money to stop the pipeline so we don’t ship oil to China.
4374 2018-04-19 16:20:00 It’s probably just an oil change lol
4375 2018-04-19 16:19:56 Putting peppermint oil in coffee >>>
4376 2018-04-19 16:19:47 Ah- the sweet memories- getting stuck on the logging road, a tree falling and getting me out of class, blowing a motor up on the WVa turnpike because I never changed the oil.
4377 2018-04-19 16:19:45 Because these snake oil salesman are taking your money selling you a "lifestyle"? You are the one investing it he lifestyle and "vertical branding integration" ..thats not my level.
4378 2018-04-19 16:19:32 Thyers Rosewater Witchhazel, Vitamin E Oil, couple drops of Tea Tree Oil, and Water in a little spray bottle has changed my life
4379 2018-04-19 16:19:32 You guys don't have Blockchain Oil?? I heard that cures everything!!
4380 2018-04-19 16:19:29 For those of us who did use of English in our 1st degree will understand PMB's statement was referring to youths who haven't gone to school or make any effort but sit down at home expecting freebies cuz they are from oil producing nation and the word "lazy youth " was never used
4381 2018-04-19 16:18:59 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。
4382 2018-04-19 16:18:58 mix baking soda & water until pasty and add some essential oils (I usually use lavender and rose or something gentle) and then I sometimes add a little coconut oil and let it sit in the fridge for a while then just apply with your fingers or whatever you prefer works wonders
4383 2018-04-19 16:18:39 Wat is d purpose if I may ask?  I come from an oil producing community in an oil producing region & I can categorically say the president's comment is spot on & captures wat some youths represent in my region. Truth is bitter but we shld b humble enough 2 accept it & make amends
4384 2018-04-19 16:18:30 @MBuhari is a terrorist. You don’t have to associate with the killer of your own supporters; the Biafrans. It will be the height of evil and ingratitude.

4385 2018-04-19 16:18:26 Have you tried a tea tree peppermint oil combo?
4386 2018-04-19 16:18:26 If oil literally gets over $70 a barrel I might just actually piss my pants #GoodThings
4387 2018-04-19 16:18:18 I added tea tree oil back to my skincare routine for the first time in years and I swear the smell has been following me around all morning. It’s so good but smells so bad.

Can I also use it to wash my car?
"totally"

There's been a terrible oil spill. Can it help save baby animals?
"hell yeah man"
4390 2018-04-19 16:18:13 And for AB shutting off oil to BC.
4391 2018-04-19 16:18:06 I describe your beauty with oil, acrylics, rhyme and reason.
4392 2018-04-19 16:18:01 con oil superior a 70 creo que estamos entrando a la recta final...
4393 2018-04-19 16:17:49 may question ako kumain ako ng chicken na luto tapos nagkachicken skin ako. pag pinahiran ko ba to ng chicken oil, mawawala? o may tutubong chicken sa balat ko?
4394 2018-04-19 16:17:48 And with a US glut of oil! WTF?

4401 2018-04-19 16:17:17 Indeed; Even oil companies know this and are investing in renewables. We can’t keep poisoning our environment.
4402 2018-04-19 16:17:17 It's a good thing Moe's focus is to score points with the oil industry in a dispute that doesn't involve him. #priorities
4403 2018-04-19 16:17:14 Restricting Alberta oil to BC might have an issue.
4404 2018-04-19 16:17:06 10 year Treasury note back at 2.93% versus 2018 peak of 2.94%... up from 2.40% at end of 2017. And stock market down less than 1% after a pretty good week in stocks. And $68/$69 oil going to translate to even higher gas prices heading into summer

4408 2018-04-19 16:16:46 “Hi I’m Winry and welcome to Full Metal Alchemist.” 

 Drinks an entire can of oil and stares into the camera.
4409 2018-04-19 16:16:45 If we even assume, were thout conceding, that most Nigerian youths are lazy, want freebies because of oil money, the question is, who created and continues to uphold the rentier state? Who supports federal character over merit? who is against fiscal restructuring and continues /1
4410 2018-04-19 16:16:37 @MBuhari is a terrorist. You don’t have to associate with the killer of your own supporters; the Biafrans. It will be the height of evil and ingratitude. He killed thousands and counting. Forget about the oil deal with him. It’s a NO deal. We own it in abundance.
4411 2018-04-19 16:16:37 “Tremendous vast amounts of oil” for some reason reminds me of General Ripper warning of fluoridation “And as human beings, you and I need fresh, pure water to replenish our precious bodily fluids.”
4412 2018-04-19 16:16:28 I tried to get my hair braided but oil think im a pass
4413 2018-04-19 16:16:27 Taking applications for someone to help change my oil
4414 2018-04-19 16:16:20 I take CBD oil drops! Took me a while to deal with the taste but they seem to help take the edge off my chronic pain issues :) It's pretty magical  I'm so glad it's helping you find comfort as well
4415 2018-04-19 16:16:19 One time when I was a little kid my mom told me my cat ran away so I grew up hoping he was happy with a different family. BUT, when I got older, I found out he really just drank out of a puddle of motor oil under a car & died when I was 7 & my mom didn’t have the heart to tell me
4416 2018-04-19 16:16:11 No matter.....Zinke will just destroy the animal in favor of the damn and oil prospects....
4417 2018-04-19 16:15:48 fashion is the no.2 polluting industry in the world 
(second only to the oil industry)
4418 2018-04-19 16:15:43 That was very obvious in his handling of oil pipelines. Did a 180 overnight.
4419 2018-04-19 16:15:29 Check your Engine oil this morning.
4420 2018-04-19 16:15:28 Europe & Asia are slowing because of higher Oil prices. Lower Oil prices were what I had cited as the reason for their growth 2 years ago. Now the inverse is true.
4421 2018-04-19 16:15:10 Premier Horgan and his protesters are hypocrites.   They have no problem exporting almost 40 million tons of coal annually to 20 foreign countries and think it's in the best interests of British Columbians to block Alberta oil pipelines because only oil is a pollutant!
4422 2018-04-19 16:15:09 If he means that they politicians sit around and wait for oil money, then that's fine.
Nigerian youths don't sit around waiting on them anymore.
We hustle!
I've never gotten any oil money alerts. Or have you? Pray tell.
4423 2018-04-19 16:15:05 Hey @JustinTrudeau, do you really want to go down in history as #JustinCrudeau? Do the right thing & don't build new oil pipelines. The world is watching. #StopKM #StopPipelines
4424 2018-04-19 16:15:05 So I just found out that Shell has engineered a blueprint to switch over to renewable energy at any time if major states refrained away from oil.
4425 2018-04-19 16:14:22 Took my car to the mechanic for a $40 oil change and came out with a $700 bill. Awesome. Cool. Thanks.
4426 2018-04-19 16:14:17 You seem to forget the oil depletion allowance.  They will drill a hole, cap it off claiming conservation of resources then bill the government for keeping the oil in the ground.  It's been a big scam for years.  Do some homework and research how many wells are sitting idle.
4427 2018-04-19 16:14:17 If you experiment you'll find a natural oil that works but without paying endless $$$ for expensive hair products that are possibly filled with chemicals.
4428 2018-04-19 16:14:16 What happens to those jobs as the world transitions away from oil as a source of energy?
4429 2018-04-19 16:13:59 Hei Sigrun, How about investigating the #bullying, #harassment & #discrimination .@DNVGL? Companies like #DNVGL are bad for #Norway's citizens & can't be #trusted.

4431 2018-04-19 16:13:43 For the time being.I wouldn't be so sure in the future.The Scots want to stay in the EU and they will fight for it. UK is four different nations and the other 3 don't feel part of 'little England'. There isn't much 'Scottish oil' left anyway.

4435 2018-04-19 16:13:19 Hehehehehe. Conveniently left out the important Part cos of "space" 240 xtrs o. Its is you who has 105m o. I spoke to a doc from SS a while ago, he told me that 80% of them don't wanna work, the turn down jobs for free oil money & would rather do bonkering than work.
4436 2018-04-19 16:13:10 Fake news set up to stop Assad winning the war against the carazy jihadis who the west has supplied cos they want them to fight Assad.
Funny how the countries who don't want to sell oil in dollars are the "terrorists"
Assad was elected,,there is no "regime"
4437 2018-04-19 16:13:04 What is the benefit of the oil, if it is only to provide Mr President free medical bills for 160d days in a London hospital and I a Nigerian should not enjoy the benefit of thesame oil money. All of you guys supporting this wickedness is evil.
4438 2018-04-19 16:13:03 Why do so many things have palm oil in them when it's the most evil substance on the planet
4439 2018-04-19 16:13:03 I would think coconut oil on wet hair works well after you wash.  I also mix fractionated coconut oil (so it stays liquid) and put it in a spray bottle with water to spray on frizzy, tangled hair.  Argan oil is another one to try.
4440 2018-04-19 16:13:02 I can't recall the last time I had a good sleep, currently working for free as a welding and fabrication Engineer in a steel company. We manufacture oil tankers, underground tankers, silos and NBL bodies. Steel fabrication and welding ain't beans. #LazyNigerianYouths

4447 2018-04-19 16:12:08 We need a President, not a charade. You are the snake oil salesman fleecing the country and world for your benefit. Resign.

4458 2018-04-19 16:11:16 Mayonnaise is mostly oil and it works great for cleaning flat top grills and in a pinch works as well as butter for grilled cheese; I'd stick to the Dukes myself tho.

4461 2018-04-19 16:10:58 The gold mining industry is finished. Oil prices are way up and just about to bite. A 2008 type crisis looms. If the miners enter a 2008 like this, there will be nothing left. And the industry has only itself to blame.

4469 2018-04-19 16:10:12 Also of note: the original Diesel engine was designed to run off of vegetable oil. The first demonstration of the engine was with peanut oil.

There is plenty of modern research that biodiesel could replace petroleum diesel. Hemp grows fast, cheap, and produces a lot of oil

Russian = Putin is the worst equation anyone has ever come up with and for some reason the entire media is using it.

4482 2018-04-19 16:09:29 Neoliberalism seeks to include everyone. Even conservatives. And Nazis. Actually, anybody who will help get neolibs elected is gold. So they will deal with mafia & oil companies & Wall Street.

Liberalism is about Principles over Power. Neoliberalism is “anything for Power”.
4483 2018-04-19 16:09:25 LOL my suspicion dates back to that 2014 Channels TV interview where he was asked how he would manage the economy with the slumping oil prices (or something like that) if elected as President. He went: He would use the army to protect the economy.
4484 2018-04-19 16:09:07 Only those in the oil segment and govt. Get paid heavily
4485 2018-04-19 16:09:03 Silly tweet. But if we're going there, entitlement to oil money as he mentioned in the video is more common in the south.
4486 2018-04-19 16:09:00 Crude oil is the topic when the @CNBCFuturesNow joins the @HalftimeReport at 12:45pm--up over 5% last few sessions --is there more room and what's driving it?

#istandwithPMB
4506 2018-04-19 16:07:21 Wait, how is it possible that the emissions aren't concentrated at oil production areas? Almost as though 85% of emissions happen at the tailpipe rather than extraction...?

4511 2018-04-19 16:07:04 I guess with the oil company in Syria he won't be around long.  He will never make it past another election and he will soon be just a terrible memory.  Excellent work Protecting our Borders!
4512 2018-04-19 16:07:04 Yeah. Its supposed to be matte on crack according to the bloggers . I'm going to use maracuja oil underneath and see if its all facts.

4519 2018-04-19 16:06:09 Wait... is that the sound the incinerated Wagner men made at Conocco's refinery ? My mistake, the only sound they made was 'puff.' Sad.

How much does #LilVlad make from wasting #Russia 'n blood in occupied Ukraine/his oil war in Syria?

How long will the brave RUS let him?! ;-)
4520 2018-04-19 16:06:09 Have you really though? Bcs historically, mediocre white dudes have floated to the top like oil in water while better women, POC, and other minorities have generally remained underpaid and in lower positions.

4535 2018-04-19 16:04:55 I’m glad they asked you. This decision is completely unacceptable. Oil and gas activity is incompatible with marine protection. Full stop.
4536 2018-04-19 16:04:54 We don’t depend on the country’s oil to survive

We write WAEC, JAMB, POSTUME just to enter University 

With our certificate, we still become entrepreneurs and don't depend on the govt

4543 2018-04-19 16:04:12 It doesn't even look like they fried it with the Fruity Pebbles on the shrimp, just like they threw them on after they came out of the oil. I'm sure they'd dissolve but that's still false advertising!
4544 2018-04-19 16:04:12 Too excited to finally have my wheels rotated and my oil changed this weekend
4545 2018-04-19 16:04:11 Well oil spike at 180$ (which is actually quiet easy to do) can spark a worldwide depression.
4546 2018-04-19 16:04:11 And who pays for the cleanup from oil and gas polluters . . . if we last long enough to do so?
4547 2018-04-19 16:04:10 No one is going to invest in our oil industry knowing @JustinTrudeau is working on phasing it out while current oil companies are looking elsewhere to take their money before they get shut down.
4548 2018-04-19 16:04:06 Bahrain just discovered 80 billion barrels oil on its territory.. Brazil hasn't started its 200 billion barrels of offshore oil projects yet.. that's equivalent to Canada's tarsands yet to mined.. and they're both cheaper to process then bitumen..
4549 2018-04-19 16:03:57 1. Is this project finally been to Tamilnadu after rejected by few states? Reason for the rejection if so?
2. Scientists? When OPS was calling out common people with buckets to remove the oil spill, where were they hiding ?
Hoping for some answer..

4552 2018-04-19 16:03:53 Right. Which is because of the threat of US reimposing sanctions. So where do you think their oil production goes from here with lack of outside investment...

4586 2018-04-19 16:01:10 About internal issues in the decision making process at the highest levels. For example, requests for access to the special oil reserve —that he manages— without proper justification.
4587 2018-04-19 16:01:06 @NigeriaNewsdesk  As Zero Emission Vehicles become a requirement in more areas of the world are you ready in welcoming or adapting to sustainability by providing  recharging and maintenance services by helping us in oil crisis stopping harsh hazardously consequences for nature
4588 2018-04-19 16:00:52 Yeah except we were not ambushed. The mercs and regime forces crossed the river (which was the agreed line of control) and headed to an oil facility in US hands. They were bombed by various gunships and planes and hit by artillery and rockets. 100s died.

4596 2018-04-19 16:00:16 I'm big into oil. I own lots of it and I know what it smells like. It's rich smelling. The smell itself spawns property and mansions.
4597 2018-04-19 16:00:15 Should tbis not be going against EPA standards of the rule of law when it comes to protection of the enviorment from polloution that will save the oil and gas personal from exposure to toxic fumes?
4598 2018-04-19 16:00:12 Hi there. We do lovely cheese and charcuterie platters, olives, nuts (salted almonds), bread&oil and sardines & mussels. Hope to see you tomorrow. Ps good shout about the menu to be available online. Will look into.

4604 2018-04-19 15:59:44 In most scenarios, if the loss exceeds 2x the credit received, I now just take it off. Granted, I'm defending oil by rolling up, because I don't think it can get too out of hand.  I'm all about making sure my capital is being used in the best way possible....
4605 2018-04-19 15:59:36 It's the oil fry that's more of a concern hahaha
4606 2018-04-19 15:59:34 God is allowing this process because the oil is going to be so much greater this time around 
4607 2018-04-19 15:59:30 I really don't know the way and manners we analyze Mr president  speech. I think Mr president is telling us the youths that we need to think out of the box and do something tangible also to be more creative and forget about oil.
4608 2018-04-19 15:59:25 Oh man I still have to fly home for like 20 hrs  lavender oil helps me.
4609 2018-04-19 15:59:15 Follow the money. I bet there are some Canadian politicians getting HUGE kickbacks to keep our oil landlocked.

4618 2018-04-19 15:58:20 I keep getting sooo many good reviews on my Goodnights sleep oil/spray set . Im telling you it worksss !!! A women told me it has basically cured her insomnia and she just purchased it a week agoo 
4619 2018-04-19 15:58:19 When @NGRPresident that has zero media chat or press conference for 3yrs have the moral decency to go to London and say Nigerian youths are not educated, lazy and expect to be feeding on oil. I think this is the height of irresponsibility @MBuhari
4620 2018-04-19 15:58:08 @RipplsApp Stop by the Edward Jones Office of James Normington this Wednesday for an #artopening featuring artist Ylenia Mino. She will be displaying her bright Italian oil paintings.
4621 2018-04-19 15:58:07 And she hasn’t pushed hard for our energy. Phasing our coal ect. Green energy need to be phased in slowly. Look at Ontario. 1200$ hydro bills. We can’t get our oil to market now barley.... and at 1/2wmp. Rail is backed up. Farmers are having trouble getting their green to market
4622 2018-04-19 15:57:46 Loooooove coco oil! 
4623 2018-04-19 15:57:34 “More than 60% of the population is below 30, a lot of them havnt been to schl and they are claiming that Nigeria is an oil producing country, there4, they shld sit and do nothing, and get housing, healthcare, education 4free.”
4624 2018-04-19 15:57:30 My limited understanding of what goes on in Bismarck is like this, a small group of Republicans meet for fancy dinners with oil executives and do their bidding for political donations.
4625 2018-04-19 15:57:27 For those of us who did use of English in our 1st degree will understand PMB's statement was referring to youths who haven't gone to school or make any effort but sit down at home expecting freebies cuz they are from oil producing nation and the word "lazy youth " was never use

4629 2018-04-19 15:57:15 1/2
Another opinion piece.  
This author points out the very real fact most of our oil currently ships to us markets at huge discounts making the refineries in us very profitable. We already know this. This is because we only the capacity for one option...the us refineries

4632 2018-04-19 15:57:07 Why are oil stock so low? Do we have enough refineries? If not why?

4637 2018-04-19 15:56:44 Thank you very much sir for the courage to always counter and resist evil and insulting  statements directing to hardworking Nigerians youths like me and others. I am a cinematographer and a palm oil dealer, working hard to earn a living and take care of my family. #IamnotLazy
4638 2018-04-19 15:56:44 two keys---relationship is more or less direct---stock prices and oil prices. Good times are high stocks and low oil. It gets confusing because once upon a time KSA bought stocks with proceeds from high oil. times change, behaviors change, No answers, lots of questions
4639 2018-04-19 15:56:40 Oil inna me back mek me glisten
4640 2018-04-19 15:56:40 So how, ideally, do you contend with Dr Peterson critics who insist he is saying nothing meaningful and that all he's doing is using big words and complex terms to sell people snake oil?  How are they overcome?
4641 2018-04-19 15:56:38 Haha Na it’s an Arab family. You know that oil money
4642 2018-04-19 15:56:34 Honestly I’ve never meet a Nigeria Youth till date that think the oil money belongs to them.. they just want to survive.
4643 2018-04-19 15:56:30 It's disappointing, there was so much good will from the public in 2015. Now the libs have changed in search of easy oil patch $. All these meetings held in private, with FN, the Canadian public not included. Again a country is held hostage by a single sector of the economy.
4644 2018-04-19 15:56:28 Dubya loved oil just as Pruitt does. They’re both dolts
4645 2018-04-19 15:56:26 Right now probaby merely to distract! The U.S. eventually wants to have control over Syria. They want to run oil pipe lines through it and more. None of what the U.S. France and the  U.K. has done  has anything to do with how Assad treats his people.
4646 2018-04-19 15:56:20 Precisely. Just as Alberta is busy de-carbonizing the oil sands. Kudos to the AB govt and industry.

4648 2018-04-19 15:56:15 Who has Buhari not blamed for his failure? He has blamed oil price, blamed PDP, blamed GEJ, blamed all the past leaders..now resulted to blaming the masses, specifically the #lazynigeriayouths does this WAECless fellow know what it means to be the CIC of a country?
4649 2018-04-19 15:56:00 i used to always joke that every ex boyfriend i will ever have will have to deal with no more free haircuts and brow waxes. but now i’m like “fuck i need my oil changed” okay you win. 
4650 2018-04-19 15:55:56 The oil companies are just sucking your wallet empty there sucking your car up to LOL
4651 2018-04-19 15:55:53 JT has no convictions anyway. He tells each audience (Canada, France) what he thinks they want to hear re oil sands. Like a teenager craving approval. Pathetic.
4652 2018-04-19 15:55:46 What an arse of a day it's been today haha sponsored by starr tattoo supplies using world famous inks croc oil and the bumble bee killer bee crew Richard Batey Lloyd Bantleman Babs Bantleman Jordan Williams
4653 2018-04-19 15:55:45 $CEI another low floater in the Oil sector that can run hard over 72c. Worth watch.
4654 2018-04-19 15:55:41 Did he actually said Nigeria Youths?
"A lot of them didn't go to school and wan everything freely, claiming that we are oil producing country"
Does that statement generalised every hardworking, educated and innovative youths?
Only the lazy youths are insulted.
4655 2018-04-19 15:55:32 And you will vote for him even tho' he has a conflict of interest with China, importing oil field equipment from company owned by China. Party first, country second. Asshole!!!!!!!
4656 2018-04-19 15:55:32 $REXX Bullish MACD crossover on daily. Small cap oil play.
4657 2018-04-19 15:55:30 Yup, but shoring up NE Syria with US and ME allied military and controlling  oil a good step.  Reducing the use of chemical weapons by attacks beats doing nothing.  Too bad GOP foreign policy experts personally attacked @POTUS making it difficult to evaluate their advice.
4658 2018-04-19 15:55:04 Slappin masses of baby oil on so people believe we actually had a day of sun 
4659 2018-04-19 15:54:52 8:30 oil change appointment, literally was the 1st few folks here, I’ve seen at 12-15 folks come and go since and I’m still waiting waiting on a fucking oil change I really hate y’all @hudiburgtheppl
4660 2018-04-19 15:54:49 So was the money expectation. It was based on oil at $100.
4661 2018-04-19 15:54:40 I support @OilsandsAction and the many thousands of Oil Patch workers who do not support the @UAlberta preposterous plan to give Davis Suzuik an award. We in the Alberta Oil Industry consider him a deplorable for his reckless condemnation of our Resource Industry!
4662 2018-04-19 15:54:40 Yea I use the oil... it’s great. Haven’t used it in a while tho
4663 2018-04-19 15:54:35 For those of us who did use of English in our 1st degree will understand PMB's statement was referring to youths who haven't gone to school or make any effort but sit down at home expecting freebies cuz they are from oil producing nation and the word "lazy youth " was never used
4664 2018-04-19 15:54:32 Yes,  we Nigerian youths are very lazy, the only thing we can do is to ride power bike get injured then flown abroad with free oil money. Shame shame shame -----shame

4667 2018-04-19 15:54:25 With hindsight Yellen was right ! low oil is boon for economy

4674 2018-04-19 15:53:54 I Think a few of Nigerian youths would have being better . cause the reality is that the percentage of youths directly or in directly having there daily bread from Oil money is Minute
4675 2018-04-19 15:53:54 دكتور انور يالغالي, هل تعلم ماذا حصل في 2008 بعد زيارة بوش الابن, وتم ضخ 500 الف برميل زيادة. وانا اتفق معك في رأيك لا زالت هي المؤثره رقم 1 في العالم.
4676 2018-04-19 15:53:50 Hopefully #Canada and oil can hang on for a couple more years until we can elect a sensible and competent PC gov't.

4677 2018-04-19 15:53:46 Haha nice! HUGE debate locally right now.. Fed Gov on board w/ oil co. going toe to toe vs Provincial (state) Gov. who’s against the pipeline. Those waters are pretty 
4678 2018-04-19 15:53:30 Why would the curve flattening/inverting be good for stocks???? The bond market is literally saying lower growth ahead. Baa yields are moving higher & HY mainly bring subdued by higher oil prices.
4679 2018-04-19 15:53:24 I’m irked the Rio de Janeiro body glow oil is sold out every damn where  halp me oprah
4680 2018-04-19 15:53:18 Yes... not exactly but in curry also same tadka is given! Tastes different... even for masoor dal I eat it without any tadka, just with little mustard oil and a chilly.. it tastes good also!
4681 2018-04-19 15:53:12 Free lil oil change but i gotta pay for my tire rotation
4682 2018-04-19 15:53:06 Instead of oil pipelines water pipelines, instead of gas use solar hydroponics for energy and food.
4683 2018-04-19 15:53:05 Baby oil for make up remover 
4684 2018-04-19 15:53:01 So can Alberta now abandon transferring money and oil to the rest of the provinces, citing provincial borders as an excuse. After all its in the best interest of Albertans to keep their tax money

4686 2018-04-19 15:52:59 Anyone seen a solid explanation for why govvies getting taken to the woodshed today? Oil up, but not nearly as much as breakevens, and commods broadly down.
4687 2018-04-19 15:52:58 Oil got Carter, Clinton, Bush, and made first 4 years of Obama really hard
4688 2018-04-19 15:52:56 Don't trust a "free-thinking" organisation that takes 7$ milion from big oil companies as tax deductible donations.
4689 2018-04-19 15:52:52 "No surgery" is a great way to die sooner and in more pain.

4700 2018-04-19 15:52:12 March 28. 5.2mb SPR oil sold. "delivery period for this sale shall be May 1-May 14, 2018 (site 1)and May 1-May 31, 2018 (site 2).  early delivery in April is encouraged to the maximum extent possible." If early delivery, could start soon. #OOTT #EIAreport #oil
4701 2018-04-19 15:52:08 Oil runoff isn't going to create half the problem that literally forcing a town onto contaminated pipes that are falling apart, though.

Flint was an act of racism that isn't nearly comparable to simple pollution.
4702 2018-04-19 15:52:08 Oh Jessica, you are in over your head here. You comparing Norway to Canada. Ask yourself, what allows Norway to get away with all this? Statoil, a govt owned Corp who has oil and gas operations in 60 countries. This has allowed them to have such a high standard of living 1/2
4703 2018-04-19 15:51:50 you coulda paid my manly ass to change the oil for you lol
4704 2018-04-19 15:51:49 Seriously. I'm a south south man.Nigeria&JV dug oil in our land and rendered it polluted.We had fishes&farms but no more. Our wealth was used to build Abuja.They share our wealth as allocation. We are feeding d entire nation for 50yr now.Tell me one person begging in SS
4705 2018-04-19 15:51:47 Again drilling isn't done in NJ. It's done 50 to 100 miles out. With  refineries already along the Delaware River you don't hear about oil  spills if at all. Off shore is even safer and IT"S not NJ waters. Murphy  is just a hack that's rich, so he doesn't care about lower prices.
4706 2018-04-19 15:51:45 if you're wondering why #OIL can't hold gains, Denis Gartman is now long

4708 2018-04-19 15:51:33 My vitamin e skin oil smells like cherries, I wanna drown myself in it
4709 2018-04-19 15:51:19 Sun & wind will be here for millenia to harness power- coal, diamonds, oil will not. Advances of today can capture that clean  energy! We need more on board to force our government to invest in viable -  long term  clean energy ventures- result employment and profits. Win win!
4710 2018-04-19 15:51:19 We had a CO that liked shooting at lube oil barrels with an M-14. Anytime the snipes had empty barrels to go over the side, CO would go DIW, have them dropped and sink them. RHIP.

4715 2018-04-19 15:51:00 Nigerian youths in film work 20 hours a day or more on sets, shooting and editing and the president thinks they're lazy and waiting for oil money. 

#LazyNigerianYouths
4716 2018-04-19 15:50:59 Dear Mr. President,

I didn't graduate top of my class, but I made it through a very hard school. I also bagged a Master's Degree in 2015.

I'm not unemployed. I'm NOT waiting for free oil money & free housing. I work long hours all week & do a bit of farming.  #LazyNigerianYouth
4717 2018-04-19 15:50:59 I’m reading Hawking’s "A Brief History of Time" in which he speaks of “singularities.” I don’t quite get the idea, but it's clear that Pemex is a “singularity” in Mexico’s oil regime.
4718 2018-04-19 15:50:56 @TransArtGuide Brighten up your Wednesday with wonderful Italian oil paintings by Ylenia Mino. Her paintings will be on display at the Edward Jones Office of James Normington.

4720 2018-04-19 15:50:51 @SpinalResearch @JOsborneNeuroPT #LondonMarathon2018 Just having a think about the runners this weekend. Shall we pack after sun instead of massage oil for the runners? #tohottorun #gandtforme #seeyouatthefinish

4731 2018-04-19 15:50:20 Awesome. I got the idea watching Tom is am doing the same. I was filled on my order a bit ago. Now wait to see what oil does. This was a big move up.. over 10% so I am very inclined to get a bit directional here with rich premium.
4732 2018-04-19 15:50:07 Any foreigner that watches that video or listens to that speech will conclude that Nigerian youths are lazy and banking on oil for free healthcare and education - which should normally, actually be free in a sane country.
4733 2018-04-19 15:50:06 I fully believe that AB would pass a bill that required them to run generators/fuel oil engines full time and they they need all their oil to do it, thus incidentally inconveniencing BC
4734 2018-04-19 15:50:03 Fun Fact: It's literally motor oil.
4735 2018-04-19 15:49:48 So, I guess Alberta really can turn off the oil pipes now, @EmmMacfarlane?

4751 2018-04-19 15:48:21 Supreme Court won't free our beer. And Cdn politicans won't free our capacity to export oil. If I were a citizen of any other country, I would conclude the Cdn government is screwing its own citizens out of the opportunity to be comfortably middle class.

4755 2018-04-19 15:47:43 KSA spent $250b of reserves and 95mmb of oil to keep prices low and the world from drilling.  When someone says $75 oil? That doesn't recover anything, just brings offshore competition back.
4756 2018-04-19 15:47:43 @realdonaldtrump Why if we're so oil efficient, and less dependent on import oil are we paying 70bucks a barrel? Almost 3.50gal in Wa St..

The greed to  of the insane digging the last piece of coal, the last gallon of oil is the downfall of us all.
4776 2018-04-19 15:46:09 I just don't understand why it is necessary to sell off what has been protected for years to big oil. Are they that greedy?
4777 2018-04-19 15:46:08 I can remember when u said we shouldn't worry about the oil the will not finish when our time comes we will enjoy the oil
4778 2018-04-19 15:46:06 Too bad you aren't a cabinet member, then you could spend $12,000 in taxpayer money to gallavant around the country. I hear there's an opening coming soon. What do you know about trashing our environment and catering to the oil and gas industry?
4779 2018-04-19 15:46:00 would it hurt, to nationalize the US oil industry or ?
4780 2018-04-19 15:45:59 Getting an oil change and just found my next car.... fuck! Need to start my go fund me....
4781 2018-04-19 15:45:59 Weather is cyclical, but 2think that not switching 2 NG fueled vehicles, (large tractor trailer rigs) wud not b better is goofy. Big Oil doesn’t want it; they buy votes to get what they want, therefore they get what they want. The air we breath gets dirtier by the hour.

4792 2018-04-19 15:44:57 Nope she's right. Oil is still going to flow. It's just where that oil comes from and what the human cost of it is. Look at the bigger picture bud. #blind

4816 2018-04-19 15:43:02 Where oil gets refined is irrelevant. Shutting a pipeline doesn't change the worlds demand of oil it simply moves the supply to the M/E.
4817 2018-04-19 15:42:58 How about you just start by giving up your toothbrush, cell phone, plastic bottles, laptop, ipad.  NO OIL NO TOYS. I can certainly tell by your tweet you have zero experience in the oil field.
4818 2018-04-19 15:42:58 Oil is at $160 a barrel right now...

4840 2018-04-19 15:41:03 WTI oil at $69.31/barrel, +$0.84.
4841 2018-04-19 15:40:57 First the added salt and sugar now palm oil. Instant Whip ( pharmaceutical grade), Kit Kat, Brunch bar, shortcake biscuits, Penguin biscuits, all containing palm oil. Not my dietary advice by the way. This could be a demanding project.
4842 2018-04-19 15:40:47 Lie, there is no proxy war on Iran, is a Yemeni Saudi  war, but the destruction and killing of Yemenis under the pretext of Iran? I am sure that there is no Iran in Yemen, neither near nor far, and the truth is that there are oil wells on the border with Saudi

@maryjane00003 There is no humanity left in our world! US, UK and France are keeping their silence on the yemen genocide in exchange of arms and oil deals
4844 2018-04-19 15:40:41 What a shit disturber. Flip the question; if he was elected PM next year when would HE shut Alberta's oil industry down?
4845 2018-04-19 15:40:41 I’m just sayin. Population will continue to rise while oil availability will decrease. This will create some SERIOUS issues. Economically. We need to find another way 
4846 2018-04-19 15:40:33 yea my bf has a shit ton of tea tree oil so i will definitely use that!! thank U!

4849 2018-04-19 15:40:21 Hey Jordan! This is bad, but not as bad as when I dropped an entire bottle of olive oil on my tile, kitchen floor! . Kiss the kids for me!
4850 2018-04-19 15:40:16 Basically the highest price of oil in almost 3 years. 
Dunno why the N isn't stabilizing against the $.

4852 2018-04-19 15:40:09 Genco Pura sounded familiar.  It was The Godfather’s olive oil company! It’s now the actual name of a hemp oil company!  Whee!!!
4853 2018-04-19 15:39:54 Could someone please explain to me how having another pipe will keep our prices down. Don't we sell oil to the US they refine it and sell it back to us?  If the 2nd pipe is going to be sold offshore(china), how does that benefit BC? We'll just get the cleanup when it leaks/spills

4861 2018-04-19 15:39:33 Oil spills could be soaked up by a new floating substance that combines waste from the petroleum industry and cooking oil. The new polymer acted like a sponge to remove crude oil and diesel from seawater. The polymer can be squeezed to remove the oil and then reused. …

4876 2018-04-19 15:38:26 No no no, you got it all wrong. AB is attempting, in the words of Notley, to"provide Alberta with the legal mechanisms needed to get full value for our energy resources." The tariff-like measures of an oil embargo clearly only has "incidental effects" on interprovincial trade. ;)

4883 2018-04-19 15:37:59 Yea! My piercer said that and vitamin C oil are super good for healing, I never had to use vitamin c because the tea tree worked so well (just dilute it with water on a cotton swab/pad) and it's also great for healing acne :)

4889 2018-04-19 15:37:20 And the darn gas needs to go down too... I guarantee that once electric cars and renewable energy begins to surge, then the demand for oil will drop and force the prices of oil (and therefore gas) to plummet.

4932 2018-04-19 15:33:33 idk if I quite agree with that comparison. power lines can be used to circulate green energy. pipelines are strictly used as infrastructure for the dirty oil industry and are much more likely than power lines to accidentally spill harmful chemicals into the environment

4939 2018-04-19 15:33:01 Oil works well. Smear it on, let the jar sit overnight, peel off what you can, repeat. For sticky residue left behind, try scrubbing it will baking soda or coffee grounds or a copper scrubber, or all of the above.
4940 2018-04-19 15:32:59 I am skeptical of the Saudis for many reasons.  They have been a bad actor on the world stage for years, but have gotten away with it because we need oil.  I think they're trying to make changes for very cynical reasons and WWE and others are pawns in this.

4947 2018-04-19 15:32:28 No infrastructure, permafrost (which will get worst with climate change,) the Saudis still able to drive the price down to bankrupt competing oil sources & so-so reserve potential will probably keep all but the reckless out - but the reckless can cause lots of damage

4974 2018-04-19 15:30:27 If you use EMS exercisers like I do... here is a little secret... you don't have to use the gel that they sell for these... essential oil works well. Since I tend to have oily skin, (and a bit of a rebel I guess) I figured this out...
4975 2018-04-19 15:30:22 One of the assistants in this shop has a dental abscess which is painful. One of the other assistants has brought her clove oil, and the third has told her to rub it with salt water.

I am attempting to impress on her the possibility of sepsis.

4977 2018-04-19 15:30:22 Aren’t we buying the refined oil back from the States at a higher price??
4978 2018-04-19 15:30:16 みんな、夜更かしはだめだよ。そろそろ寝ましょう。
4979 2018-04-19 15:30:05 Yes it would, but refined product is more profitable by truck & by rail.  Also, existing pipelines can handle refined product much better.  The primary opposition to pipelines & coastal concern is the Dilbit.  We are blessed with oil sands but, it's pretty caustic stuff.  #ableg
4980 2018-04-19 15:30:04 it's the new oil boom!
4981 2018-04-19 15:29:57 That’s a falsehood and you’re spreading it. The NEB completed *another* review of the business case in May 2016. Oil prices imploded years before that. 

Don’t spread fake news.

4983 2018-04-19 15:29:49 But,  a lot of them did not go to school and they are claiming Nigeria has oil. Hmm.  It's unfortunate bro
4984 2018-04-19 15:29:47 But do you have an oil field ?
4985 2018-04-19 15:29:45 Me quedo con esta frase de @andres_azpili “Data is the new oil” #InnovationDayIAB

4988 2018-04-19 15:29:42 How much disel fuel did you burn getting the equipment there?

Canada's Oil Sands is cleaner fuel than most of what the world produces. Which also produces less polution than one single refinery in California. But please, keep protesting something you use.

if women are like car keys then you must have wondered why yours snapped at the ignition because of your views on women.
4992 2018-04-19 15:29:31 Careful. Run that for oil sands bitumen - your refined product yield per barrel bitumen is much lower than same bitumen diluted for shipment, plus you don't need imported diluent moved by pipe.
4993 2018-04-19 15:29:26 It's not oil. It's a hot broth/soup :)

Cheiii God. What is life?

5018 2018-04-19 15:27:55 Fair bit going on there, but largely will come down to oil price and operational updates I expect - just good to see some change in sentiment there

5046 2018-04-19 15:25:55 This only includes Indiana schools, but you get a sense for what it looks like here. IU often eliminates the massive paydays by doing 2-for-1 contracts with lower-level FBS and P5 teams. When they do it with Ball State, the BSU end is played at Lucas Oil in Indy.
5047 2018-04-19 15:25:53 Not dissimilar to the auto industry - cars become more featured, and thus more heavy, solve it with more powerful engines. It takes an oil crisis to drive efficiency over power.

5064 2018-04-19 15:24:39 She is actually correct.

5112 2018-04-19 15:19:58 @mikko On Information as Oil. 
Like Standard Oil (pre the Seven Sister split up). Like monopoly or oligopol. Like not using anti-trust legislation on Google etc. Why don't ppl talk about that? Consequencies of market imperfections & infosec.
Strange times.
Just a friendly thought
5113 2018-04-19 15:19:54 much oil and pipelines have been good for last 7 days...
5114 2018-04-19 15:19:46 ZB shouldnt be allowed to uptick until oil loses $3

5121 2018-04-19 15:19:28 40% of US oil imports are from Canada and only about 17% comes from all mid-east countries combined. The idea that we are reliant on some foreign advisory for oil is a false narrative.

5130 2018-04-19 15:18:42 But we have to pretend that we aren't subsidizing oil. Our economists write reports justifying the continued status quo and we have to pretend they are making fair and reasonable analysis...

5178 2018-04-19 15:15:05 With common sense we can easily understand that blocking oil & gas produced to the highest standards in the world and in a socially responsible way is the surest way to make the planet worse for our kids.

5239 2018-04-19 15:10:10 No, if you read what I sent you it because of very high taxes, which Cons don’t want.  The government owns the oil in Norway and they didn’t spend their heritage fund so people didn’t have to pay taxes like Alberta did.  No taxes, no programs.  It is not the oil industry.

5244 2018-04-19 15:09:31 I’m saying the idea that local control is always reactionary and should be done away with is overly broad and the question should be at what scales are decisions best made. To exclude housing is clearly wrong but is excluding an oil train equally so?
5245 2018-04-19 15:09:31 'some of them HAVEN'T BEEN TO SCHOOL claiming Nigeria has oil so no need to work' but you here talking about having 6 degrees so you not lazy. You reacting to something you haven't taking your time to read. Lazy folks way if you ask me.
5246 2018-04-19 15:09:30 @AMEXHI_Oficial should have focused its attention on the economics and administration of an efficient minerals regime. For this, the oil history of Mexico and the prognostications of IEA are irrelevant.

5253 2018-04-19 15:09:07 In late 2016, the authorities changed the definition of debt to a consolidated basis; [...] The IMF’s definition of debt includes advanced oil sales, treasury certificates, central bank loans, and domestic arrears that are excluded from the official debt definition.

5255 2018-04-19 15:08:56 I’ve worked for several of these. There’s always been competition, price wars, and oil at even higher prices. The CPG behemoths have never been able to pivot quickly

5266 2018-04-19 15:07:53 Since the outbreak of the conflict in Syria, Israel has awarded drilling rights for oil and gas in Israeli occupied Syria to a company called Genie Energy (board consists of J.Rothschild, Murdoch, Cheney) – that’s why the Syrian war is good for business.
5267 2018-04-19 15:07:47 You have to pan fry it first on a cast iron skillet with olive oil both sides for about 2mins letting rest for 2 more mins after and then you have to boil it for 5 mins and then bring down to a simmer for an additional 5 mins. Then place on cooling rack over night after that-

5322 2018-04-19 15:04:16 The oil industry has been one of Canada's primary meal tickets for so long, it has assended to sacred cow status. Mark my words, we will still be fighting over getting oil to market in 40 years, even if the world has gone electric.

5509 2018-04-19 14:47:38 I agree. Oil and tobacco divesting is something that’s already done. Yet 401k providers look for cheaper funds so they can be competitive. Funds that are socially aware tend to be a bit more expensive so you rarely find them in 401ks. 1/2
5510 2018-04-19 14:47:35 These people and their countries have had an infiltration of CIA Saudi Arabia and god knows what other groups to remove the men who decide they want better than the petro dollar. The white helmets are hardly a squeaky clean organisation. Its dirty. Its for oil. Its not right.

5515 2018-04-19 14:47:13 Today I’ve mainly been cleaning a guitar that a friend has asked me to set up. It was his nephew’s. It has to said that I have never seen strings as black or a fingerboard as dirty. It’s clean now and the lemon oil is soaking into the rosewood board

5517 2018-04-19 14:47:09 Boss: How was the Flyers game last night?
Me: It was like you set a dumpster on fire, emptied that into a truck full of dried wood, leaves, and paper, then crashed that truck into an oil tanker.
5518 2018-04-19 14:47:02 I put the last of our veg oil in my outdoor wood burner. Might as well use it for something constructive lol
5519 2018-04-19 14:46:54 Or we can take the oil trains. These trains are lightly regulated, have gotten more unsafe and are ultra secretive in their movements. Folks are rightly scared their towns could be wiped from the map or could be poisoned. What recourse should folks have, if any?

5527 2018-04-19 14:46:02 Most of the oil on the east coast come from the US.

Review where all the oil from Nfld goes. It goes to the US.

Why don't they supply eastern Canada?

5528 2018-04-19 14:45:59 Indian Rupee ended marginally weaker today. Persistent Dollar demand by oil importers, noting rise in crude oil prices to over 3-year high weighed on Rupee. However, some losses were recovered due to Dollar sales by foreign banks and exporters.

5544 2018-04-19 14:44:45 Please, what does “"A lot of them haven't been to school, and they are claiming, you know, that Nigeria has been an oil producing country therefore, they should sit and do nothing, and get housing, healthcare, education, free” mean to you?
5545 2018-04-19 14:44:41 #LazyNigerianYouth Go out of the country, and see how Nigerian youths are excelling, Why? duh, because the Country where they reside is organised. Nigerian Youths are the brightest and most hardworking any day anytime. In the eyes of PMB we're Lazy and waiting on "oil Money" SMH!
5546 2018-04-19 14:44:35 Yes And you can produce it from any oil. But once again It is not a name I gave it, blame the petroleum industry, not me. They called it that for decades and then hired a PR firm (one that tried to convince us Cigarettes don’t cause Cancer) to change its Dirty image #tarsands
5547 2018-04-19 14:44:22 We really don't need polls to tell us people's opinions on this matter. Count the number of SUVs on the road. The people have signalled where they stand. Count the number of people leave the supermarket with plastic bags. Those numbers show support for oil.
5548 2018-04-19 14:44:18 π！π！

5557 2018-04-19 14:43:43 $DNR $GST $XOM $DVN $NFX if oil passes $70 watch out, money flow will be off the charts.
5558 2018-04-19 14:43:39 Don't the oil companies understand that when a new Democratic president takes over, they will have to forfeit all their investments in obvious spots of contention like this? Oil is a product that will see falling demand continue. Peak oil production was reached in 2005, folks..
5559 2018-04-19 14:43:37 Like others, before I could read I still would like to look over the Sunday comics.  I used to think that Nancy and Sluggo were Olive Oil and Popeye when they were kids, like Muppet Babies.

5562 2018-04-19 14:43:05 Hardly. We serve it at wedding receptions to indicate how inclusive we are along with butter naan/rumali roti. And of course, what can restaurants do when people come to 'Keral' and ask for veg-khana that has no coconut oil in it? So they dish up paneer
5563 2018-04-19 14:43:05 First I need to let my yard dry, then pick up the yard and rake up debris leftover from the winter, then I need to sharpen my mower blades and change the oil in both mowers... Then the mowing begins.

But I’m sure you already did all of that

5565 2018-04-19 14:43:01 waiting for the benz technician to pull up to the crib and give my car an oil change.
5566 2018-04-19 14:42:59 Wait which oil d jakky get?
5567 2018-04-19 14:42:58 I do most of my own maintenance on my truck - my dad raised me to work on cars myself. I've replaced the whole rack and pinion, spark plugs, etc. I [normally] change my own oil and that sort of thing, too.
5568 2018-04-19 14:42:56 One little change can make all the difference! I dont use oil anymore. Only to untwist. I think my hair prefers it. it weighs my hair down but my hair LOVES shea butter.
5569 2018-04-19 14:42:55 Tea tree is good but for me jojoba oil is better
5570 2018-04-19 14:42:52 Ugh, pro tip: never use olive oil to grease the pan for cooking eggs. Eww.

• what do you take it for?
• how often? 
• what source (brand) do you get it from?

Thanks guys 
5579 2018-04-19 14:42:03 They probably tested a nuke. Earthquakes can be triggered by mass explosions or even shale oil drilling.
5580 2018-04-19 14:42:00 I thought the goal was to have clear skin not oily? Why are we looking like we poured baby oil on our face.
5581 2018-04-19 14:41:59 Use olive oil as a conditioner by leaving it warmed up on your hair for 15 minutes before shampoo.

5589 2018-04-19 14:41:00 Motive behind the bombing is not ISIS its to keep the military bases there and dig the OIL. so America is greater terrorist then ISIS. There is soo much in justice in this world. Sham on America

5602 2018-04-19 14:40:03 Yeh yeh yeh. In addition to the battery problem (& cobalt mining in Congo) Norway continues to export it’s CO2 through export of oil & gas. It’s like pissing in your trousers to keep warm

5612 2018-04-19 14:38:25 RT oiltalk99: RT nuanalytics: #OilTalk  - Talk that Saudi Arabia has its sights on $80-$100 a barrel oil again and of more U.S. sanctions on Russia ignited a rally in commodities and resource stocks on Thursday, though the potential boost to inflation hit fixed-income assets.
5613 2018-04-19 14:38:21 People & animals die every day, from the mess industry (Gas&Oil&Coal) has caused. Children with asthma gasp for breath.  Grouse & other bird numbers decrease.  Frogs & fish are disappearing.  Admin Pruitt is CORRUPTED by his relationship to industry.  FIRE PRUITT NOW!
5614 2018-04-19 14:38:17 Why isn’t @PremierScottMoe having a hissy fit over the gouging at the pumps by big oil!  Oh right, don’t bite the hand that feeds you!
5615 2018-04-19 14:38:08 Based on 56 yrs of the current line w/o incident? Based on the decades of tanker traffic bringing Alaskan crude thru those waters 2 WA refineries? Or US special interest funded hysteria whipped up to ensure AB oil is land locked and they remain it's only buyer at a reduced price?

5619 2018-04-19 14:37:35 The Alberta govt is likely to be sued, epically via NAFTA if oil companies profits are hurt. Turning off the taps is likely to blow up in our faces.

5621 2018-04-19 14:37:15 What does he mean by they evade education, expect free house. The oil money fela said was missing 2.8billion naira was when he was a dictator
5622 2018-04-19 14:37:07 Saudi Arabia is an ‘ally’, in that they sell us oil and buy a ton of weapons. The selective & hypocritical outrage that’s directed at Iran, Syria and others but not SA is really a question of geo-politics IMO. Saudi Arabia behead more people than ISIS, a truly vile regime.
5623 2018-04-19 14:37:00 Idk if this is new oil or spilled oil from yesterday 
5624 2018-04-19 14:36:59 Change the oil, rotate the tires!
5625 2018-04-19 14:36:54 I think Indy would do well to buckle down in Lucas Oil Stadium and try to grow as much as possible within that. Prove their worth which will take longer given the market with Colts/Pacers and then in ten years? You get a few co-owners no reason not to build a stadium.

5639 2018-04-19 14:35:37 The oil industry isn't going to like this.
5640 2018-04-19 14:35:33 This is a basic misunderstanding of the proponents of oil.  We are drawing a line at the expansion of the tar sands--meaning no new pipelines.  Who said anything about Toronto surviving without fossil fuels?  There is going to be a time of transition.
5641 2018-04-19 14:35:31 Why were we not told the correct info to start with ? A fire fight resulting in 200-300 deaths is a serious matter. How many deaths were US soldiers ? Notice that it was another case of protecting an oil & gas field.
5642 2018-04-19 14:35:29 Harper also saw the completion of the Alberta Clipper, to Wisconsin, approved 2008 and active in 2010. The changeover in line 9 taking oil west to east was approved and activated under Harper. Alberta added 1.25 million BPD pipeline capacity under Harper . Check your facts.

5656 2018-04-19 14:34:36 So it is OK to ban the interprovincial trading of beer for safety reasons. Good thing no province could ever possibly consider oil, or any other product, as a safety issue...

5677 2018-04-19 14:32:58 @NGRPresident @MBuhari 
How do you expect them, not to be lazy?
Not to sit down and be waiting for oil money?

Mean while the slots and vacancies are not been occupied or filled with the appropriate and qualified youths, rather the privileged ones with connection.
No job creation
5678 2018-04-19 14:32:54 So you gon pay rent, light bills, gas bills, WiFi, baby ? Bottles, formula ? Car ? Gas ? Oil changes ? I don’t think nobody really plans to have a baby. Shit just happens
5679 2018-04-19 14:32:54 Oil & gas development uses increasing amounts of available groundwater, which is especially bad during times of drought. Guessing if wildfires are bad, there's a drought. And surprise: a lot of that is in Western Oklahoma.
5680 2018-04-19 14:32:51 BTW ... didyou ever find proof to back up your claim oil from the oil sands is the dirtiest in the world? I'm still waiting.
5681 2018-04-19 14:32:39 The only one I supposed to have gotten wrong I was sure was the Esso Humble Oil tiger.

5685 2018-04-19 14:32:14 Ngl a lot is based on what I’ve seen and research and I’ve done. But the facts are there; their GDP is just about $600b (for the 2 largest oil producer),most of their service sector is run but expats (even the F16s they buy from the US has to be flown by Pakistanis), corruption.
5686 2018-04-19 14:32:06 Yeah, food sells fast. You can start at work. Edibles is easy. You can youtube the recipe for butter, or oil. At this point I make the salt and sugar too.
5687 2018-04-19 14:32:00 meanwhile the feds will force one province to receive oil from another...
5688 2018-04-19 14:31:59 If oil speculators keep driving the crude oil prices up on Wall Street that’s when the market will spiral downward!

5692 2018-04-19 14:31:34 I deadass feel like comfort colors t-shirts absorb oil 
5693 2018-04-19 14:31:24 No most of the world calls them oil sands. You see, as our knowledge about them advanced we realized the original term was incorrect. We moved on, environmentalists with a political leaning did not. I'm guessing you fall into the latter. P.S: you can't get tar from oil,
5694 2018-04-19 14:31:22 Not anymore. City has surpassed united. 3 titles in 7 yrs and saudi oil money will keep it that way.
5695 2018-04-19 14:31:16 How can you say no bias? That's like polling 12000 Alberticans how they feel about oil. Our subscribers do not buy the overpriced "dirty" being "pushed" by so called licensed"growers". We get our SAS Clean Green from farmers familiar with agricultural, CFIA, and Tobacco Acts.

5706 2018-04-19 14:30:25 This is, to put mildly, a troubling last sentence from you. To equate the cost of acquiring commodities with labour is intrisically problematic. Acquiring labour is tatamount to permanently change the firm's fixed cost structure whereas buying some more oil isn't.
5707 2018-04-19 14:30:22 Then first let’s keep the oil in Canada and offered to people of Canada at a price we can afford to buy not give it to the Chinese for nothing
5708 2018-04-19 14:30:12 Ms Jarrar spoke truth; Bush's were butchers and racist. Led USA into unjust war for oil and $.

5711 2018-04-19 14:30:01 Actually, doctors recommend olive oil. And no, it’s not a ‘contraindication’ for statins. And yes, statins lower the incidence of cardiovascular events in high risk patients. But hey, don’t let facts & evidence stop you from providing unqualified medical advice.

OK he that is employed what has he done with the employment? Is Nigeria better with him as her president? 
This man just keeps insulting and disgracing us constantly.

I am embarrassed I ever supported you.

5724 2018-04-19 14:28:32 I'm always real - Trump demonstrates his lack of knowledge on an hourly basis.  He doesn't understand the basics of civics nor how the government works.  He's nothing but a cheap huckster of snake oil, and he has taken you in.
5725 2018-04-19 14:28:32 The "Dangerous & Chaotic" Foreign Policy of the Trump Presidency:

Isis is decimated in Syria
North Korea will denuclearize
North & South Korea end WAR
Israel moving its Capital to Jerusalem
Exportation Of US Oil & LNG to Europe

America as the World's only SUPERPOWER is back.

5740 2018-04-19 14:27:45 There are many viable alternatives to oil and such but implementing it is halted by big businesses caring about money and not the planet, until that's addressed, we should stay on earth lol
5741 2018-04-19 14:27:45 I buy a CBD oil that is legal in all of the US, yet they go through the same issues with credit card processing and now resorting to overseas processors.  Power in numbers, they should join up!

5749 2018-04-19 14:26:25 It is pathetic that after our 2015 support. @MBuhari  could describe Nigeria youths as Lazy, uneducated and waiting for oil money. i leave home 5am and get back 10pm daily for 18k minimum wage and my president said I am lazy. 2019 is here #LazyNigerianYouths

5808 2018-04-19 14:20:35 The cartel plus Russia has never had the worlds best interest at heart. The good news the US is slowly moving towards energy independence. The downside higher oil prices push the risk of recession. Higher oil revenues in certain hands also lead to higher risk of terrorism by prox

Only later did I see the note simply to massage him with Nivea oil
5813 2018-04-19 14:20:17 And if I may ask in what area is the investment, more oil exploration they've been doing for years, how far as it gotten NG, not one single refinery they have running in NG.

5819 2018-04-19 14:19:52 Actually that’s my point, thanks. They would have pulled out by end of September. I was in Ft.Mac when  oil crashed, they shut the gates instantly, they didn’t wait eight months and then give a two month warning. Remember they didn’t ask for Gov buy in either.

5831 2018-04-19 14:18:43 That's very true... 
crude oil and Nifty can simultaneously move higher... Crude has its own trajectory while Nifty however bad news it is if liquidity pumps in it will move higher regardless of inflation, oil prices or Bank scams.
That's how market works.

5851 2018-04-19 14:16:36 I think you should look up what "tar" is. There is NO TAR in the oil sands. If you already know this and continue to use the term, then I will disregard anything you say as I would consider it to be false also. Understand?

Bro, let him ignore d lazy; concentrate on d 40% and reward their hardwork accordingly if he can.
5867 2018-04-19 14:15:09 The Crosby guy thinks oil is going to 120 this year. He is one of the many Madani supporters/enablers that I will have fun with once we are vindicated.

5868 2018-04-19 14:15:01 Im sitting on 70,70.5 & 72 calls so watching close. Oil can reverse, as big as first move. So I wait. Lots of fundamentals going on.

5918 2018-04-19 14:11:37 In fairness, he meant a lot of youths (not all, not majority) had a sense of entitlement because Nigeria is an oil producing country. Whether this was a good thing to say should be the subject of debate. He never said anyone was lazy nor did he answer off-point
5919 2018-04-19 14:11:35 I love getting out of the shower and slathering myself in a thick layer of coconut oil and immediately putting on a robe to allow myself to marinate

5926 2018-04-19 14:11:14 #Nigerian President @MBuhari says young Nigerians claim the country is producing oil thus they should sit down and do nothing, get free housing, healthcare and education.

I get it, you need to feed your families, you're doing what you can to survive but oil is not the right way.
5954 2018-04-19 14:09:28 There are presently thousands of young people hustling in Computer Village who don't  even care about the oil but @MBuhari thinks they deserve to be called #LazyNigerianYouths

5964 2018-04-19 14:08:39 So trading oil I like at least a 10 wide spread or more like you have done when initially putting on. Rolling up in this case to 16 delta puts it a bit close to call side. I would rather roll up to 10ish delta & wait. I don't like to invert. I would rather roll out to next month.

6060 2018-04-19 13:59:22 @Varneyco love how when Obama was president Fox News used Brent oil price now with Trump its WTI! Today Brent is $74 and WTI is 68. Fair and balanced!
6061 2018-04-19 13:59:18 Apparently not.

6063 2018-04-19 13:59:02 ...and oil...
6064 2018-04-19 13:58:56 The economics are rather splendid at the current oil price. Nice profit coming in each month now at the provisional 212-236 bopd. Seriously doubt you will be able to pick up placing price shares given the market knows this is coming and expecting a bounce post-RNS.
6065 2018-04-19 13:58:47 If you want a fucked up sleep schedule just work in the oil field
6066 2018-04-19 13:58:47 try to get some compression socks and when you get home soak your feet in hot epsom salt with blood orange oil for awhile then elevate them and make sure they’re above your heart so the flow of blood is workin good
6067 2018-04-19 13:58:34 That's good oil.  As opposed, you know, to the stuff from Alberta.
6068 2018-04-19 13:58:27 @WhiteHouse 2) Experts agree #Syria #Douma #Skripal Hysteria by Fake Media CEO's & Congress charlatans is pushing Oil+Gas to $100/barrel :Lobby is biggest donor for Political Campaigns, so Congress incompetence makes US Workers+Farmers+Industry+Families  pay for this disaster .
6069 2018-04-19 13:58:20 What of the ones that have been to school? Are they seeing any benefits of Nigeria being an oil producing country? That man needs a high five in the face with a chair made of steel on adrenaline rush from hulk.

6074 2018-04-19 13:57:43 Bingo! They are going to have to shift the baseball and football seasons eventually. I now count on making money in golf in November, and being pretty much stagnant until mid May. But I guess "Oil" and "Jobs", right? Joke.

6078 2018-04-19 13:57:26 Many youths are uneducated and want freebies cos of oil.
6079 2018-04-19 13:57:21 Hello again everyone. Another issue i’ve been thinking about is alternative energy. We should invest more in new ways to make energy that doesn’t cause as much pollution. We should also expand our oil expedition because we are running out of oil very fast.
6080 2018-04-19 13:57:17 Trumpers bought the snake oil. They should have listened to New Yorkers, but, they didn't because Trumpers think New Yorkers are east coact elitists.
6081 2018-04-19 13:57:16 I use only water soluble products. Wax based products will build up and not rinse out. I scrub my head for a couple mins in a hot shower. In the beginning you’ll go through a bit of a greasey phase but it will even out and train your scalp to produce the right amount of oil.
6082 2018-04-19 13:57:10 I need a oil change
6083 2018-04-19 13:57:03 We're going to end this conspiracy against the American people right now and nip this high interest rate high oil price fiasco in the bud.

2.6% rates and $60 oil is fine.. gouging is not acceptable.  Gore and his friends. are going to have to live with that.

6093 2018-04-19 13:55:56 When I compare ND to other states in the US... is hard to understand why ND has such a high property taxes AND sale taxes but other other hand so much money comes in from the oil industry ND never had before. Something’s goes very wrong here.

6102 2018-04-19 13:55:00 “Nebraska has fewer wells than some fields within states. ... Despite Nebraska's  low overall oil and gas production, several companies are acquiring  substantial leases in the state. And at least two have drilled  horizontal wells—which often employ fracking, in the Panhandle.

6110 2018-04-19 13:54:20 listen to me @MBuhari , you will be roundly disgraced in the 2019 elections, for calling Nigerians lazy,  oil money dependants. I am not lazy,  and a know many other Nigerians aren't lazy too. I pay my rent,  I provide myself with water and electricity, I pay for my healthcare.
6111 2018-04-19 13:54:15 I think Buhari is comparing Nigerian youths to his children and their pampered friends that don't want to work and rely solely on the oil wealth of the nation.
6112 2018-04-19 13:54:15 If you call me Lazy to my face, might just fuck around and show you how lazy youth waiting for oil money behave, since we trynna be foolish

6130 2018-04-19 13:52:11 Wish the nl gov didn’t assume higher prices in the future though. Should always budget for low oil prices.
6131 2018-04-19 13:52:11 Christian Horner regarding the #ChineseGP: Following the @ScuderiaFerrari cars was more difficult than following @MercedesAMGF1. Is it because of Ferrari creating dirtier air or that oil coming out from above the rear light? #F1
6132 2018-04-19 13:52:00 In order to produce renewable nergies, you need capital and technology, we don't have that. Producing oil would give us at least capital to develop our country. To refuse that in the name of an agenda promoted by countries who don't share our interests is insane.
6133 2018-04-19 13:51:54 @SanMiguelCO let me get this straight.  You are suing oil & gas companies because they provide the products that your entire economy is built on?  How do you expect all of those tourists and celebs to travel there, have skis and mtn bikes, clothing, etc.?  Hypocrites much?
6134 2018-04-19 13:51:52 Obama is a Satanic Illuminati Witch--which is kinda cool actually! All tragedy is a farce! A farce...of farts! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
6135 2018-04-19 13:51:35 What buhari said “More than 60 percent of the population is below 30, a lot of them haven’t been to school and they are claiming that Nigeria is an oil producing country, therefore, they should sit and do nothing, and get housing, healthcare, education free.”
6136 2018-04-19 13:51:32 How will this effect the #KinderMorgan #Transmountain pipeline? BC can say ok, here’s a law that prohibits oil across my border.
6137 2018-04-19 13:51:29 The Comeau ruling is about liquor not oil, doesn't deal with the scope of any federal law to limit or broaden interprovincial movement of goods, such as oilsands crude, but I think it could bolster B.C.'s NDP govt's intention to try to restrict bitumen movement through B.C.
6138 2018-04-19 13:51:21 Smh, the new engine in my car is burning oil . this car is giving me nothing but problems this year. definitely gonna get myself a new car by the end of this year.

6149 2018-04-19 13:50:26 Aside from that, wind/solar cause REAL pollution. See Congo, China, solar panel disposal, etc.

Btw, it takes about 400 tonnes of COAL to make a wind turbine. 1,000 liters of oil per year. Many cubic meters of cement. Lots of cables.
Plus BACKUP.
What's the CO2 benefit again?

6163 2018-04-19 13:49:29 Think oil a bigger driver now, as well as a 20 mcm/d cut in Norwegian supply to Oct. 1 announced today. Coal has been losing out to gas in the UK for some time because of the carbon floor price
6164 2018-04-19 13:49:15 I perceive inflation . . . everywhere.  Price of oil approaching $70.  Gold up tp $1350.  10 year Treasury yield now above 2.90%.  The story is being told.#moretocome

6182 2018-04-19 13:46:46 Also, you have to be careful with using CBD oil made with  coconut oil and added salmon oil for pets because that's a lot of grease for small dogs especially if its a thunderstorm lasting hours. Might want to give doggie more than one dose. #CBDoil #CBDoilforpets
6183 2018-04-19 13:46:45 I also believe when oil gets low we will see countries make plays to take over other countries. How are missles, tanks, and jets gonna run without fuel?

6190 2018-04-19 13:46:06 And they say Nigerian youth are lazy, that we want free oil money. Is the oil your own? Have your own children not been eating from this same 'Oil money' all their lives? While we eat palm oil and we're still the lazy ones. We need to make sure @APCNigeria is voted out mbok!
6191 2018-04-19 13:46:05 Petrol price - compare with the crude oil price. When crude oil price is falling, why are petrol
prices still high? #No2Modinomics

6192 2018-04-19 13:45:54 No, it is not their interest to develop oil in other countries. Their interest is in the renewable energies because they have the monopoly on the technologies for their production.

I graduated in 1998,learnt barbering and set up my shop since then. I'm also into ice block production to diversify my earnings. I'm not lazy. President Buhari has been leaving and feeding on Nigeria's oil since he was in his 20s

6204 2018-04-19 13:45:20 I lost my mother-in-law 40 years ago and it's upsetting to read this. If I'd thought of olive oil, it would've been 45.

6234 2018-04-19 13:43:08 But it is OK to continue to offer subsidies & tax breaks to oil & gas? To pass legislation protecting Insurance from consumer lawsuits? To tag consumers w/ “fees” on virtually all our utility, cable & phone bills? Are u blind to this?

6236 2018-04-19 13:42:58 That means they lied when they said they can’t control the price but in fact right now they are keeping it steady despite the fact that global oil prices has increased.

6256 2018-04-19 13:41:07 2/2 Additionally slowing supply into a market with growing demand only drives prices higher, and in oil and gas this increases the likelihood of pursuing a more marginal barrel and pressuring the industry to try to recover more faster.

6322 2018-04-19 13:35:23 Hi Amy, what you're seeing is actually a mixture of oil and crumbs that can sometimes form during packaging and it is not peanut based. Please DM us the UPC, expiration date with the letters & numbers that follow. Thanks!
6323 2018-04-19 13:35:18 Buhari is saying Nigerian youths don't want to work bcoz they believe their country has oil??...The man has a big problem.

6328 2018-04-19 13:34:55 Agree, we have Natural Gas generators as part of our oil and gas property portfolio. We need power over $0.80 (with gas below $2) to even have a sniff at ROI. 

Not apples to apples but $0.12 does not pass my smell test for full cycle ROI, not even close

6336 2018-04-19 13:34:12 I also like Boqvist. Oil in a tough spot if they want him. Won’t be there at 9, could take him at 3 if they draw that spot. Likely they would need to trade up a few spots if the like him that much.

6403 2018-04-19 13:28:57 I think it’s all about oil and hiding connections and sales.

6459 2018-04-19 13:22:14 I don't disagree that eventually the bid for CGBs for safety/diversification will become a structural story, but the collapse in 10yr CGB yield was all on the back of the RRR cut and had nothing to do with the CNY oil contract.
6460 2018-04-19 13:22:11 Meanwhile, a recent commodities rally following U.S. sanctions against Russia, a major materials producer, continued. U.S. crude oil surged to a fresh three-year high and lifted shares of energy firms
6461 2018-04-19 13:22:08 The problem of Nigerians is accepting facts. It's true that Nigerian Youth are lazy and want things free. They want oil money.

6463 2018-04-19 13:21:58 The reality of it is that once chronic illness and chronic pain starts, there is no cure. CBD oil is the safest way to maintain it, everything else causes you addiction to chemicals and a hard opioid addiction. At this point doctors don't cure the illness, they mask it

6466 2018-04-19 13:21:46 Well Jet, I went and blew up an oilfield.

Oil fires are fucking hot and the initial explosion is mildly ridiculous.

Not just ANY oilfield, mind you, it's the biggest oilfield on this planet, so... it was a really big explosion.

And there weren't a lot of places to hide-
6467 2018-04-19 13:21:29 New Priest does the quarterly "anointings" after Mass where you stand in line but instead of getting the white thing Father puts oil on your hands and gives you *airquotes* anointing of the sick *unairquotes*
6468 2018-04-19 13:21:29 I do it just like that with olive oil and parsley. Comfort food to the max (also loads of Parmesan and Pecorino but you specified no dairy and it’s just as good without)
6469 2018-04-19 13:21:26 @realDonaldTrump Kim Jong-Un & North Korea have already signed denuclearization contracts with various entities. NK has already benefited (free heating oil, etc) from such  agreements. Ask China to protect the world by taking possession of North Korean nuclear sites immediately.
6470 2018-04-19 13:21:25 So, why have you decided to criticize our PM over building one pipeline? We find it odd that you are not campaigning against your own country-the very country which is shipping oil to us via tankers just off our East Coast? Do you not see the hypocrisy on this issue?

So three hours later I've got a new tropical background and now slowly working through every surface of original character. Fun part: I am longing for actual oil paints instead of these digital PS brushes. They're really not the best.

6481 2018-04-19 13:20:30 I think that's a common mistake - snake oil won't do anything for a sunburn.

6484 2018-04-19 13:20:04 My story is brief. Was vacationing on Quadra Island where Suzuki has one of his several homes. I stopped at a local store for a coffee. Suzuki came in and bought 5 different newspapers, went out to his VW Van which was leaking oil badly and puking blue smoke and drove 500 m home

6507 2018-04-19 13:17:50 Crude oil, the strategic commodity. If you want to kill an economy, choke off its energy. The questions are, why and who benefits?

OPEC is dead. Has been dead for decades. Each should go their own way instead of being controlled. The same way the EU should disintegrate.
6519 2018-04-19 13:15:52 No, California and Venezuelan oil sand extraction is more polluting and carbon intensive

6522 2018-04-19 13:15:21 Yeah but start if off in cold oil, not hot. Then warm it up until you can smell it. You don’t want crispy brown garlic.
6523 2018-04-19 13:15:15 Is this peak oil, peak capitalism, or peak laziness? Asking for a friend.

6525 2018-04-19 13:15:07 PMB is so naive to know that Nigerian oil is not only the resources he should manage but also those uneducated, those that want free healthcare and education as refered to in his statement are part of the resources he should manage. He clearly demonstrated that he has failed.
6526 2018-04-19 13:14:58 “More than 60 percent of the population is below 30, a lot of them haven’t been to school and they are claiming that Nigeria is an oil producing country, therefore, they should sit and do nothing, and get housing, healthcare, education free”
6527 2018-04-19 13:14:48 Crude oil is now US$69.22 a barrel

6534 2018-04-19 13:14:20 Best of luck my man. 

My two cents: CBD oil, keto diet, no surgery. Also major lifestyle change. Whatever you are doin, try something else.
6535 2018-04-19 13:14:04 Didn’t OPEC and Russia cut oil production last year to drive up the price per barrel?
6536 2018-04-19 13:14:03 Eight years ago, America suffered the largest oil spill in our history. Today the president and his administration are proposing opening the Pacific coast to federal offshore drilling for the first time in decades. #DeepwaterDisaster #ProtectOurCoast

6543 2018-04-19 13:13:13 The oil price is rising from low of £40 now £75 so gas bills will rise.

Electricity becoming more expensive as we close old power stations and more and more renewables come on line.

It's easy to believe evil corporations pushing up prices but down to
Government green policy.
6544 2018-04-19 13:13:12 Why don’t the drugstores take back the drugs? Stores that sell motor oil have to take the used oil.
6545 2018-04-19 13:13:00 The maths are pretty straightforward, cost of buying the car + petrol, + insurance + parking + oil changes/maintenance + repairs + MOT + tolls etc.... This is the math no one does.

6562 2018-04-19 13:10:50 He’s probably say something like, “what’s her niche; what sets her apart from the thousands of other brands in the clothing industry” - the industry in which he’s mentioned being in the top 3 WORST eco-friendlies behind oil/petrol (he asked not to be quoted on that ranking stat)
6563 2018-04-19 13:10:35 Much of what's going on in the Middle East is part of what I believe to be the globalist narrative. Keep countries off the gold standard for currency and control oil. I think @sahouraxo is right on the money. MSM is in bed with globalists. Syria smells like Iraq, it's BS.

6590 2018-04-19 13:08:07 Roast them at 400 degrees F— a little olive oil, some sea salt and pepper — they are done when the edges are brown/blackened. Trust me, they won’t taste like icky cabbages anymore.
6591 2018-04-19 13:08:04 Got my tire fixed and oil changed for less than i been paying for just my oil...that sure pissed me off but I’m happy
6592 2018-04-19 13:08:01 There is a level of nausea this morning that is the equivalent of seeing Scooter naked covered in motor oil.

By the way, always knock before going to his garage at night.

I've seen things.
6593 2018-04-19 13:07:56 Sounds gross but warm olive oil. It always works for me. I take a spoon, put a small amount of olive oil on it then take a lighter under it for a bit. Make sure it isn’t too hot and pour that shit in and hold your head still for a few minutes. Then tilt it back & clean spillage
6594 2018-04-19 13:07:43 Although oil ignores the dollar moves.... while gold is manipulated.
6595 2018-04-19 13:07:42 man im on 2 hours of sleep & my day has begun with an oil change 
6596 2018-04-19 13:07:32 On another note, I need a haircut & an oil change

6603 2018-04-19 13:07:07 @JonErlichman How will higher fuel (crude oil) prices affect the Canadian economy when gas prices start hitting upwards of $1.50/L ? Bad time for the Liberals to start adding frivolous carbon taxes to everything. Add can't afford to drive to work, to can't afford to heat homes.
6604 2018-04-19 13:07:04 Coachella is urban outfitters lvl duplicity driving money to a climate denying oil billionaire actively holding down marginalized communities & helping elect pro gun republicans.

There are ethical places to spend $ on music locally that also dont generate 700 tons of solid waste
6605 2018-04-19 13:06:57 As some from south Louisiana, 10 years ago our oil business was BOOMING. Now, more than half of those jobs are gone.
6606 2018-04-19 13:06:52 The eyeball at the top of the pyramid on money is actually a tiny camera!  No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
6607 2018-04-19 13:06:50 coconut/mct oil and coffee are both confounders. Especially if had on morning of test or frequent intake in days leading up. Cut them out for two weeks and retest and see if any difference

6611 2018-04-19 13:06:12 Hey @JustinTrudeau, do you really want to go down in history as #JustinCrudeau? Do the right thing & don't build new oil pipelines. The world is watching. #StopKM #StopPipelines
6612 2018-04-19 13:06:02 Change the oil within the suggested service intervals. Checking and changing your oil will help your engine and vehicle run smoothly. While changing your oil as required is important, using the manufacturer’s recommended oil for your vehicle can improve gas mileage by 1-2%.
6613 2018-04-19 13:05:39 Then give back the $3.2 Billion in oil industry subsidies.  Looks like the business can stand on it's own two feet without government handouts.

6615 2018-04-19 13:05:21 Yusuf Buhari is a typical example of a Nigerian youth who depends on Nigerian oil

6616 2018-04-19 13:05:17 After Ont election build port services on great lakes and build pipeline East to Ont. Expensive, but gets Canadian oil to market.
6617 2018-04-19 13:05:13 I think the words you're looking for is"modernise" and "transform", rather than "phase out" and "destroy". We must leave the coal, oil and gas in the ground.

6623 2018-04-19 13:04:19 Dave, will oil perform like gold or relative to equities?
6624 2018-04-19 13:04:10 So you think that is right? That 60% of Nigerian youths haven't been to school and 60% are of Nigerian youths are claming that we are oil producing country therefore want things free??
6625 2018-04-19 13:04:10 Two fact should separate. Maritime Boundaries and Oil. For Timorenses more proud to have boundaries clear that the oil. That was our dignity. Small country can bring big country in table & guarantee other big country (Indonesia) not involving in negotiations.

6636 2018-04-19 13:03:21 @fkeyamo a brilliant lawyer, no doubt, but a terrible economist & political  analyst. Any one who equates low oil revenue to our welfare has complete missed the point. Besides we vote for a party's manifesto. Leader's integrity is only one consideration.
6637 2018-04-19 13:03:17 Growing up I was told oil and water don't mix. Thank you Exxon!
6638 2018-04-19 13:03:17 Same philosophy that has my state's leaders giving oil companies the lowest production tax rate in the nation while calling our profession "greedy".

6675 2018-04-19 13:00:10 Oh yes I do. I have the 'optimal' diet! Fruit, vegetables, nuts, legumes, olive oil, whole foods, not junk food (or rarely junk food). Despite that I am vulnerable, so go preach elsewhere.

6681 2018-04-19 12:59:41 So,  you can’t pin the lazy mentality on the APC government of 3yrs. Laziness made the Nigerian terrain a fertile ground for yahoo boys, drug big boys, slay queens, bobrisky-esqe eccentrics, ‘Oil’ big boy e.g Ifeanyi Ubah etc. Laziness brought about this whole madness.
6682 2018-04-19 12:59:39 @barometerca As the energy sector attracts bids do you think $CAD goes up with it?  Do you think there’s risk of a similar 1990-91 oil spike that brought $CAD to 90 cents (perhaps by 2020-21)?

6720 2018-04-19 12:56:05 Where did you make up that data from? We all want to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, that won't happen overnight. The pipeline is the safest way to bring ethical oil with high environmental standards to the coast and reduce reliance on blood oil.
6721 2018-04-19 12:55:59 You are not able to confirm that TSX has no oil burning issues or are you not able to guarantee that the TLX or MDX will not have similar issues?

Uganda is set to convene a conference on oil and gas to discuss opportunities in the sector a head of the oil exploration which is expected to kick off in 2025.
6861 2018-04-19 12:41:07 I'm not going to go into politics, but those ear buds need to go! Just went through 4 weeks of olive oil and a flush out of my ears as I'd pushed the wax back and counldn't bloody hear due to them things!
6862 2018-04-19 12:41:05 Are any of you suffering hardships? You should pray. Are any of you happy? You should sing praises. Are any of you sick? You should call for the elders of the church to come and pray over you, anointing you with oil in the name of the Lord.
6863 2018-04-19 12:40:51 Not taking any funds from them may be ok for Weld County, but this is a big district. S.E. Colo. Would like some oil/gas exploration. It would give us a big boost. Send them here!

6867 2018-04-19 12:40:36 An Imperative Sentence gives a directive. The subject is "you" which can be stated or unstated. Example: Dissolve yeast in the water and let it sit for 10 minutes. In a big bowl, combined the water/yeast, milk, sugar, salt, and oil.

6880 2018-04-19 12:39:32 Amazing fact: 15 of them were saudi nationals, 9/11 led to the invasion of iraq, in 2002 saudi aramco was an 'underdog' in terms of revenue, in 2018 they're the richest oil company, meaning saudi arabia either got lucky or they planned the entire thing along with the us gov.

6883 2018-04-19 12:39:05 TBF watching the demise of crude oil from like $110 to $30 a barrel was pretty fucking special. People abandoning oil stocks when it dipped below $50 because we didn't know where the floor was 
6884 2018-04-19 12:38:56 I'm sorry but if you're saying you LOVE drinking almond milk with tumeric and coconut oil and it's your new FAVORITE drink, you haven't been drinking the right things in your life.....
6885 2018-04-19 12:38:55 Have an agenda. And that's fine. But take a company like Exxon or another big oil company. Say they go find a group of independent scientist to research climate change. Big oil doesn't want scientists to say that fossil fuels are a leading contributor to climate change.

6926 2018-04-19 12:33:41 But oil companies hired @simonjbridges and @NZNationalParty  to protect their profit. Why did this happen? Let's tell people less fossil fuel causes cancer or less jobs or more global warming, anything to scare them from moving away from it.

6932 2018-04-19 12:32:47 Conclusion: Centralbanks buying OIL, BECAUSE OF THE 2 % INFLATION TARGET. TILL TODAY I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY NEED 2 % BUT THE MORE THEY TALK ABOUT IT THE MORE PEOPLE STARTING TO BELIEVE IT..BIG BIG JOKE

6934 2018-04-19 12:32:46 That's just a blatant lie. Doctors can say whatever they like about diet, lifestyle changes - including telling patients to use olive oil to displace saturated fats, to EAT more oily fish, NOT fish oil caps which aren't always potent. But you've just made up a crock full of it.
6935 2018-04-19 12:32:38 Jeff, you need to oil and break that bad boy in, lol.

6946 2018-04-19 12:31:19 with the historical precedent of cigarettes and petrol, I've little hope.

6975 2018-04-19 12:28:58 Buhari says Nigerian youths are "lazy" and want "freebies".

This is a man whose administration has spent taxpayer's money looking for oil in the Northeast.

Is it not lazy not to find ways to improve education, infrastructure and healthcare?

Lesson: It's easier to shout CHANGE!
6976 2018-04-19 12:28:58 Buhari is right on this:

"More than 60% of population is below 30, a lot of them haven’t been to school & they are claiming that Nigeria is an oil producing country, therefore, they should sit & do nothing & get housing, healthcare, education free”
6977 2018-04-19 12:28:56 Increase rates and yield curve inverts. Hold rates and dollar declines, oil prices shoot up and inflation rises. What will fed do??
6978 2018-04-19 12:28:55 Lets accept the fact that oil boils under rebulican rule. Historical price trend is the evidence.

7057 2018-04-19 12:21:52 The Saudi King has said many times that crude oil at 20$ is an acceptable price. Why? Because they have already pumped and stockpiled enough of it to last 1000 years. He said it in an interview and several times since.

7171 2018-04-19 12:12:09 Well informed people know exactly what happened to the Russian mercenaries who tried to take an oil refinery the US was protecting in Syria. It was a lightning fast, lethally devastating conventional defense. It kills Trump that his Russian paymasters won't let him brag about it.
7172 2018-04-19 12:11:58 US stock futures are down 0.1% with Asia positive and Europe mixed.  Oil is $69.42 with  gold at $1,353. See how oil has edged up to almost $70 a barrel and gold has rose to over $1,325 to over $1,350. Nerves are still on edge.

7199 2018-04-19 12:09:22 Trump has halted drilling permits and is selling our oil reserves. He is depleting our reserves so that he can jack oil prices. This is why gas has gone up so much!! .75 cents!!

7264 2018-04-19 12:03:44 Curious to see the pace of this diversification. Reducing reliance on oil will likely reduce the influence of the royal family, making it harder to get away with human rights violations and autocracy.

7347 2018-04-19 11:58:01 AU CONTRAIRE... ?

7551 2018-04-19 11:41:08 That oil needs to be taxed coming in to make it a level playing field with our own.  We need a National Energy Independence policy in this Country, we need true leaders to shows us all what the financial benefits are to Canadians' prosperity not just Albertans.

7595 2018-04-19 11:36:36 I strongly disagree about debunking. They are HIGHLY useful for those, who don't know how to find out if particular project scam or not. Now many people are more skeptical and not investing in one more snake oil... or solar roadways.

7681 2018-04-19 11:24:45 Again, Harper had 10 years, why didn’t he do something? The conservatives are always the one screaming about oil industry.  My point is the can’t scream and criticize when they did absolutely nothing when the had the chance. Quite frankly I think KM is the one playing games here.
7682 2018-04-19 11:24:27 Yeah but what’s in it?  Mostly oil?
7683 2018-04-19 11:24:21 @chigrl #WTI I tried to gather former crude oil POCs: I got $75.70, $81.15 and $93. 
Do they tell you something or I'm off like an off-road? Thx.
7684 2018-04-19 11:24:17 Hi there should i sell oil ?
7685 2018-04-19 11:24:10 Canadians need to also keep in mind, the producers of the oil sands is predominately, foreign owned. So what we're arguing about, is, foreign investors are the ones who want to pipe oil across Canada's environment, to save transportation cost, to increase profits.
7686 2018-04-19 11:23:59 You dumb twit! Your portrayal of #Alberta's oil sands as TAR SANDS is not appreciated & hurts our economy. It's unfortunate that climatards listen to anything you spew! #cdnpoli #abpoli

7695 2018-04-19 11:23:20 #SaudiArabia is hitting hard times due to low oil prices. They had their first movie screening in 35 years last night in 1 effort by the Prince to boost the economy and create jobs. Saudi Arabia in tough financial times?! Say what.

7703 2018-04-19 11:22:10 Hi there I was just wondering how you make magnesium oil also the products I have are all non toxic if you open to hear about them
7704 2018-04-19 11:22:08 sis really needs to chill out w the coconut oil & lotion
7705 2018-04-19 11:22:04 But yet there are still dis-believers. It has to flood the house/yard...before they can see...we were on the the right course, but this reverse in policy will end in global catastrophe. Oil prices are on the rise again, corp are dropping emmployees for furture gains.

7710 2018-04-19 11:21:17 @MBuhari meets with Royal Dutch @shell in London, discussing new possibilities in Nigeria while the cleanup of the Niger Delta has been stalled. 

A fallback or reliance on oil, a fast depleting and non-replaceable asset. 

Now, who is lazy over here?
7711 2018-04-19 11:21:14 I just laughed at the internet are in their enemies apply specter oil and it leaves me drink This was not a bunch of thought,
7712 2018-04-19 11:21:06 It is estimated that a USD 10/bbl rise in crude oil prices on a sustained basis could impact annual CAD by 0.4% of GDP. Similarly, it is estimated that a USD 10/bbl rise in crude oil worsens  fiscal balance by 0.1% of GDP,” Kurian, Senior Vice President, Kotak Mutual Fund
7713 2018-04-19 11:20:58 Funny thing is, d very thing our dear president has accused #LazyNigerianYouths of, is what this president and all his predecessors have been guilty of over d years & decades. The discovery of oil made our rulers abandon what we had previously achieved economically.
7714 2018-04-19 11:20:55 I'm still discovering my one thing, but I have a feeling it will be with oil painting as my main medium. As far as the subject. I want it to be expressionistic, but right now I'm still playing around with more traditional subject matter. So glad you've found your artistic voice.

7716 2018-04-19 11:20:39 Abuse is what you get when a foreigner conquers, subdues, usurps your country and your government. He sees himself as your god,lord,and you his slaves, who labour for him to enjoy. Why he takes a 150days medical vacation to clone himself with our oil money, fly our jets...
7717 2018-04-19 11:20:18 Blockchain News is listening to @CoinAnalystTech and plotting how to make the #crypto market more transparent. Snake oil salesmen, your days are numbered!
7718 2018-04-19 11:20:14 Yes oo, he tried with the oil swap deals and how he transformed nnpc in his 1st one year
7719 2018-04-19 11:19:54 The fact that @jkenney doesn't understand publicly threatening to "cut off oil" as a leverage tactic is what puts the legislation he supports, in constitutional jeopardy is a real concern.

Maybe we need someone with legal & contract negotiating experience at helm? #ableg #abpoli
7720 2018-04-19 11:19:41 Yeah and how many oil companies have pulled out of alberta? You think they would pull out if there was still money to be made?

7723 2018-04-19 11:19:26 Oil spills could be soaked up by a new floating substance that combines waste from the petroleum industry and cooking oil. The new polymer acted like a sponge to remove crude oil and diesel from seawater. The polymer can be squeezed to remove the oil and then reused.
7724 2018-04-19 11:19:23 When a man deep his finger in oil, it must touch the other fingers or else stains the floor. Keep speaking in parables to your former benefactors

7730 2018-04-19 11:18:49 Dear @MBuhari @APCNigeria I'm a Nigerian youth, a Graduate from an oil producing community. I'm underemployed. However, I paid for my education, I pay for housing, healthcare, electricity, water, tax, and so on, as well as support my family. I am not a #LazyNigerianYouths
7731 2018-04-19 11:18:42 yea...very soo  when they'll win the PL, manutd fans will be like."oohh it's Chinese money, or is it oil money or whatever fuck they'll say"hahahaha
7732 2018-04-19 11:18:07 There is more to this story. I think the government is privy to information that alludes to future profits considering that Kenya has oil. Listing is a long and thorough process that involves investigation into a company's future. Profitability must have come up.
7733 2018-04-19 11:17:52 Standard oil?
7734 2018-04-19 11:17:47 FAO: @anasalhajji from this lecture at 8:05 : "swing production shifts from conventional oil to US shale...so far it's shale oil 1, conventional oil 0"


7735 2018-04-19 11:17:29 Oil $100 before years end.
7736 2018-04-19 11:17:08 “I’ve always said oil is not Nigeria’s greatest asset. Our greatest asset is our youth who created Nollywood out of nothing and an entertainment industry that is second to none in Africa.

7738 2018-04-19 11:16:56 $tsla always benefits from high gas prices. We could see a huge surge in sales as oil rises too fast and gas pushes through $3-4 a gallon.

7747 2018-04-19 11:15:51 Agreed Nigerian youths want the free oil money, during your generation is the free oil money that got you educated and till today some of you are enjoying the free oil money. Besides is a national cake, share it and let it go round @MBuhari

7750 2018-04-19 11:15:34 I think some of the more 'traditional' industries have not seen a huge shift towards freelance. I currently work in the Oil & Gas industry and actually there is a shift back toward perm currently as the market has compressed slightly due to the drop in oil prices.

His actions including his travel, purchases and putting sound proof booth in his office on our tax dollar is proof!
7754 2018-04-19 11:15:17 That's not how it said it tho, this is what he said which I largely agree with "A lot of them have not been to school and they are claiming that Nigeria has been an oil producing country and therefore they should sit and do nothing and get housing, healthcare and education free,”

7762 2018-04-19 11:14:14 Where he told them that lots of Nigerian youths are idle,lazy,uneducated & looking for free oil money..this administration should be ashamed of this man presenting as President!

7770 2018-04-19 11:13:08 I repeat, I  am an educated Nigerian youth that  works to earn a   living.  It is my  government that is run by uneducated  people who are   lazy and  depend  on oil money to survive.

7775 2018-04-19 11:12:43 Again you are wrong. Maybe you just don’t think there was football before the oil money saved your pathetic club from being a Tesco’s

7777 2018-04-19 11:12:29 I am a Nigerian youth and I do not depend on oil money to survive.
 I earn a living with my education, skill, creativity, connection and hard work.
   It is my President that is not educated (Who thinks western Germany  still exists on the world map.),

7783 2018-04-19 11:11:58 You must have your own data sources. Natural Resources Canada shows oil sands as 0.16% of global emissions.
7784 2018-04-19 11:11:50 This country is rolling on some comic board. We Will be aright but no one should tell me Nigerian youths are lazy. Provide proper education system, give us good medical facilities, repair our oil refineries, build home for destitudes(homeless) empower them and see wonders

7815 2018-04-19 11:08:04 The oil had spilled over into 45 miles along the river, a major sanctuary for aquatic animals in the Sunderbans. At least 20 canals and a major river, Pashur, are connected with the river.
7816 2018-04-19 11:08:04 There are other oils that can be used and there are alternatives being looked at. The only reason palm oil is used is because it is cheap. No one needs Oreo cookies. If they want them that bad they can pay a little more for them.

7818 2018-04-19 11:08:01 Commenting on outlook for oil markets at a media briefing, MUFG's Ehsan Khoman said OPEC, non-OPEC compliance to output deal likely to fall going forward, with current levels of prices #OOTT.
7819 2018-04-19 11:08:00 LOL. Please I need to ask this questions. President Buhari said youths look to oil & do not want to do anything. Which of you youth have benefited from oil? Did oil sponsor your education? Do youths own oil blocks? Has oil even translated to stable electricity to benefit youths?

7821 2018-04-19 11:07:50 A tanker carrying over 3.57 lakh litres of furnace oil sank in the Shela River at Jaimanigal under the East Zone of the Sunderbans, severely affecting the aquatic creatures, biodiversity and plants in the mangrove forest.
7822 2018-04-19 11:07:47 FWIW The 2 year and the oil market have beautifully opposing narratives here when it comes to perceptions of supply, demand and policymaker behavior.

7826 2018-04-19 11:07:10 Just bought Shu Uemera cleansing oil.. possibly the most expensive skincare stuff I’ve ever bought considering how I don’t invest much in that. But it’s so good!
7827 2018-04-19 11:06:55 A total of eight commercial ships — one oil tanker, six vessels carrying coal and fertiliser, and a launch — sank in rivers running through the Sunderbans in the last five years from March 14, 2013 to April 14, 2018.
7828 2018-04-19 11:06:44 Hoping having enough of a base tan is going to be enough to not use any oil. Could end up lobstered.

7830 2018-04-19 11:06:36 Agree but we will need to be prepared for the negative spin that would be put on it. We shouldn't put oil at the forefront of the Indy 2 argument.

7840 2018-04-19 11:05:45 City’s first trophy was in 1898/99 - a second division title. Not really much to brag about seeing as you were relegated two seasons later, to win the second division again. Ceiling height for City before Arab oil money and an owner who does not believe in human rights.

7847 2018-04-19 11:04:17 He said.. "A lot of them have never been to school. They say because we are an oil producing country, they should do nothing and get free health, free things..."

This man is dumb. I can't even cry. Has he been to oil producing states and see how they live?

7848 2018-04-19 11:04:15 Aroma oils were used by the ancients, not just for the mystical but also for health and well being. The advantage of using cinnamon oil for depression and post traumatic disorder is something we can look into even today. Hot oil but cool benefits.

So which is it?

7892 2018-04-19 10:58:31 I'm still waiting for someone in a position of power to state the obvious, that cartels are a violation of WTO rules and membership in one should lead to sanctions. Supply/Price manipulation/collusion is considered illegal in every other industry. Why is oil any different?
7893 2018-04-19 10:58:18 So were Ford and GM, IBM, TransAmerica Insurance, Dupont, Swiss banks, oil companies, and other major US and European corporations which benefitted financially by working with the Nazis. Their collaboration affected millions.
7894 2018-04-19 10:58:03 I will suggest we read Bode Augusto recent presentation on Nigeria and we will understand that Nigeria is not an oil rich country. His words: "The federation account receives less than =N=10 trillion annually which is less than 10% of national income."

7899 2018-04-19 10:57:29 I write about oil derivatives. A degree of frivolity is essential! Jokes aside, climate change is a central part of our commods coverage, whether that's oil or ags or lumber. Debate and discussion are always welcome :)

7946 2018-04-19 10:49:37 Although palm oil is the most sustainable, more and more locals are looking to it for their income therefore more land destroyed. Comparing European and Asian ecosystems to defend use of palm oil is wrong and way below the belt. Attitudes are changing and you should change yours

7963 2018-04-19 10:45:20 If I’m not mistaken, Letsetu averaged about 7 and a half minute at evens this year for the Oil.  Maybe overuse on special teams - especially after it was clear that he was struggling big time on the PK.

8005 2018-04-19 10:37:30 We were known 4 farming and fishing before the oil boom, now our lands are no longer fertile, our rivers are contaminated immensely. People die of hunger while we contribute to the wealth of the nation...

8007 2018-04-19 10:36:54 lol Nigeria has never been ready for independence. The moment the british left us its been one chaos to another. P.s idk this groundnut gist lol, Nigeria 's major source of income especially back then has always been oil. Oil is found where exactly?
8008 2018-04-19 10:36:45 If Buhari becomes our president Next year, He rigged it.. If possible, we ourselves will share rice and oil to those people they always share it to so as to Vote him out.. Clueless old president

8023 2018-04-19 10:34:37 @MBuhari you need to know the number of Nigerian trained doctors in the UK, USA, Australia, Canada, Saudi and many other countries. We are educated, we are not lazy and we don't need oil money we only need an environment to thrive and we would flourish.
8024 2018-04-19 10:34:34 Again: While most traders are looking for the top in oil; I'm looking for support....
8025 2018-04-19 10:34:29 Well its always a good idea to have combination oil. Like when you are sauteing or for stir fry, Olive Oil, Peanut Oil is best. Cow Ghee is best for Dals. For deep frying use Vegetable Oil or Sunflower Oil.. :)
8026 2018-04-19 10:34:20 Mine look dreadful because they're so short, but once I tidy them up they won't look too bad. I need to smother them in peach oil and sort out my hideous cuticles *cringe*

8079 2018-04-19 10:26:30 Hi Tracey. Great to see your passion for this; we realise it’s not black and white, We're working in South East Asia & the best way to prevent extinction now is to support (and continue to improve) sustainable palm oil as increasing demand for other oils would be catastrophic.
8080 2018-04-19 10:26:18 I don't no which part of Nigerian you are operating from but if you are in Lagos u should no that tech industry is run by Nig youth which is why Mark of Facebook  and Bill Gate are always coming here...but your MCM is talking about oil prices as if his life depend on it.

8092 2018-04-19 10:24:23 8 yrs ago today industrial negligence led to the #BPOilSpill in the Gulf of Mexico. 11 workers were killed. Largest marine oil spill of all time and it took 87 days to contain. 4.9 million barrels of oil were released. Only 80,000 barrels were captured. Devastating. Unacceptable
8093 2018-04-19 10:24:13 Six weeks, mate, they’ve left this hole in the middle of a live lane of traffic, leaking water and then tar oil, when @thameswater reinstated the #OckStreetHole without actually repairing the water leak underneath it. Shockingly incompetent work.

8103 2018-04-19 10:22:55 Generic answer: Not as much oil
8104 2018-04-19 10:22:51 Fair play to Vince. He just used an analogy about changes in the oil industry at the end of the 19th century which he may well have been around for in a speech about tackling internet oligopolies, and it's remarkably far from Silicon Playgrounds.

All these were what Buhari was trying to eradicate from Nigerians. We tot we were meant to stay at home and have money cos we got oil.
8130 2018-04-19 10:19:54 I now get it. It's OK for an old man  not go to school and since Nigeria has oil, he sits and does nothing, yet gets housing , healthcare etc for free, even abroad. Is this not Buhari's situation?

8165 2018-04-19 10:13:17 What I want, is an economic benefit in the movement of that oil, to the Canadian economy.

8385 2018-04-19 09:37:48 He said “Nigerian youths are waiting for the oil money, they want everything free and don't want to go to school". When you don't have something good to say, its better to keep quiet rather than SLANDERING YOUR YOUTH!
8386 2018-04-19 09:37:12 Truth is, the President might be wrong politically, but he is right about the fact that "MANY" think since NIGERIA is an oil major, they don't have to work hard. This is the belief of so many youths.
8387 2018-04-19 09:37:09 The context there relates to tax payers rev as a sum game for every citizen. "ammounts to ₦50,000 per person per annum"

8393 2018-04-19 09:35:54 I would suggest that if 95% of your economy is dependent on oil EXPORTS then you have already made an almighty hash of it by having no diversification or other value adding sectors. 

High oil prices make many sectors uncompetitive (e.g. chemicals).

Services must be nonexistent.

I have never benefitted NOTHING from govt and whether Nigeria has oil, it has no effect on my life.

8486 2018-04-19 09:21:18 And president Buhari is busy telling everyone at common wealth meeting that Nigerian youths doesn't go to school but sit at home waiting for free healthcare because Nigeria is an oil producing state... I then wonder, whose fault is it???

8490 2018-04-19 09:20:48 Nigerian Youths are Lazy cos this Buhari and his likes saying this NONSENSE who actually didn't finish schooling, made lots of MONEY from Oil, became people in life and now are saying SHIT about Youths cos they had a better life then. Honestly GOD WILL PUNISH YOU ALL..
8491 2018-04-19 09:20:26 Smart move by @weirgroup . Diversification away from oil & gas is strategically sensible although I'm sure @OpportunityNE_1 wouldn't agree.  Now need to move into renewables. Also less dependence on Brexit UK will help long term. Provides an escape route for them perhaps.

8501 2018-04-19 09:18:44 Yusuf Buhari is a typical example of a Nigerian youth who depends on Nigerian oil ..
8502 2018-04-19 09:18:43 When we engage in discussing Nigeria we understand our problems better, but many youth today after school wants to work in either banks or oil firms, only few thinks of being self-employ. We can only change this narrative by asking the govt. to create the enabling environment for

8513 2018-04-19 09:17:35 Cool, Art should address that, as it's his graph not mine. Again, my point remains, based on our shared numbers - oil was 1/3 higher in real terms during a company destroying downturn than 86-04 b/c we now have to exploit more expensive resources to meet demand.
8514 2018-04-19 09:17:30 I honestly think my new dry skin treatment of slathering oil all over my face might have been the culprit  #mynoseringisgone

8519 2018-04-19 09:16:31 Something I came up with Factorio - why not recycle the cartridge of ammo and refill it with less resource used?

i.e) Ammo cartridge(2 Iron plates) + 2 Iron plates = Ammo

Flamethrower cartridge = 5 Steel plates

F.t cartridge + 50 diesel + 50 heavy oil = F.t ammo

like such.

8556 2018-04-19 09:11:13 That you cannot see it is part of the problem. Many of our people cannot see it too. The attitude that we are oil "rich" has driven our economy, into the ground. And many of us actually believe we are paying full price for the first class services we expect to recieve

I feel like a canvas swells when it is oil painting.
8572 2018-04-19 09:08:57 Believe me you surprise me Olumide. I just watched the two clips, and I can’t find any difference. He claimed that Nigerian youths making 60% of the population have refused to be educated, claiming Nigeria is an oil producing state and so deserve all these social goods.
8573 2018-04-19 09:08:56 We import around 2% of our oil from Saudi Arabia.
8574 2018-04-19 09:08:08 I agree in totality with the President. Because most of the Nigeria youths hitherto been engaged in political thuggery by the then PDP led government who corruptly shared the huge funds generated from d sales of crude oil then. Today govt is doing every things 2 engage positively

8577 2018-04-19 09:07:36 Yes, the $22/bbl. oil price from 1986 to 2004 is definitely NOMINAL/CURRENT dollars and not REAL/CONSTANT dollars, i.e. NOT adjusted for inflation and NOT in 2018 dollars.
8578 2018-04-19 09:07:14 I’ll have to stop you right there. You guys go around policing the world yet your own homes need sweeping. Now you see what the likes of you did to Libya, Kuwait, Syria. Afghanistan..... now that our president discovered oil you want to come and collect. We are safer with him.

a) oil is a third higher in its most recent downturn than it was for 18 years
b) the nadir of the 15-17 crash is approx. midway in 86-04's range.
8595 2018-04-19 09:03:41 Sir,farming is a honourable profession. Kindly refrain from insulting us sir. It's farming not the oil in the Delta or any form of enterprise, that's keeping this country alive.

8607 2018-04-19 09:01:21 Thanks, madam, for calling me to attention. This is want @AdeBanqie should have simply done. 

And how truth is this statement? 

Do we actually demand free healthcare and free education "because we are an oil producing country" as the man claims?
8608 2018-04-19 09:01:17 President Buhari didn't even call Nigerian youths lazy. He queried their sense of expectations which is primarily because Nigeria is an oil producing country
8609 2018-04-19 09:01:11 I was there in 2013. The country was already falling apart. Oil was over $100 per barrel

Don't let facts get in the way though
8610 2018-04-19 09:01:08 Like the global oil price, gas price, wheat price, soy bean price, corn price, cocoa price etc etc? Or are those global markets scary too?
8611 2018-04-19 09:00:59 We just discouraged investors with this comment. Come 2 Lagos n see very hardworking unskilled, semi-skilled and skilled youth population hustling to make ends meet on a daily basis. Youth in oil producing state are less than 0.05% of youth population in Nig.
8612 2018-04-19 09:00:49 Not a thing in the US? But also, don't be. The truck was pretty grimey and the choc mix looked a little like an oil slick going on. But the guy was very smiley!
8613 2018-04-19 09:00:44 CBD oil has been touted to work miracles & I've tried several different types for my arthritis & fibromyalgia.  I have FINALLY found one that is absolutely fantastic & the results have had me feeling great with much less pain & more energy.  It's been amazing, so I had to share!

8618 2018-04-19 09:00:23 Another Oldling saying trash about the ND. please go and see what these oil companies did to the ND. they destroyed their homes, farmlands, rivers, took away their sources of livelihood, when the people went to courts for justice, of course they lost.

8628 2018-04-19 08:58:54 He didn’t say 60% are lazy. He said 60% of our population are the youths and some of them who don’t want to go to school are claiming that everything should be given free to them because we are an oil producing country.
8629 2018-04-19 08:58:45 Obviously us Ossies don’t get our oil from Syria. No news outlets warning of a severe price hike since the merry cans bombed them. I guess we get to enjoy all time low prices of $1.60 per litre for a little while longer.

His words "our population is conservatively 180mil, about 60% are below 30. Alot of them don't go to school & they believe Nigeria is oil producing....... "
8641 2018-04-19 08:57:51 @MBuhari Baba, Grandpa, You should know that not every Nigerian is a Northerner who are Illiterates, Not every Nigerian is a Militant who wait on oil Money. the average Nigerian Youth has a lot to offer more than you can ever offer because we are strong...

8652 2018-04-19 08:55:54 But we do have oil. Lots of oil. It's just not being pumped out yet. Next few years will ne interesting.

Side Note : Munyes wasn't made minister for anything else. Raise his profile, automatically he becomes governor Turkana in 22. Then the harvest begins.

8659 2018-04-19 08:54:16 the whole country is dependent on oil, as he also specifically mentioned that 60% of 180million, are youth, at no point in that speech did he speak of "region" 

what ever he was trying to say those words only projects myopia or a man who detests the youths he is suppose to lead

8702 2018-04-19 08:48:14 Certainly not exclusive to vegans. If anything I’d guess that vegans consume less palm oil simply because they’re more aware of the issues associated with it.

Slavery continued so long because people wanted to buy reasonably-priced cotton goods

KSA cuts off heads because we need the oil

8706 2018-04-19 08:46:59 My president has not even met me yet..

But there's a high probability that I have been "zoned" into the category of youths who depend on Nigeria's oil and don't want to do something for/with my life until the country does it for me. 

And we've not even met.

8844 2018-04-19 08:28:23 You see why I talk about context ,history and trajectory?
They are tools in economic analysis.

GDP was rebased in 2013(1990-2010), declined from 2015 while nominal GDP started its trajectory of decline in 2014.

Oil price crash, devaluation etc

They are intertwined.

8876 2018-04-19 08:23:08 I doubt any huge civilisation existed though! If It did we would find newly discovered coal seams empty empty oil fields exhausted ore mines etc. They may have existed pre ice age but would have been stone age societies not technological!

Cant avoid using oil all together until there is another solution for gasoline.  Otherwise there will be a serious shortage & you think gas prices are bad now???

So is pointless complaining about something that has no other viable solution atm, or cant be changed.

8919 2018-04-19 08:15:29 It is true the youths need health care, housing and other basic amenities.

It is  true that Nigeria is an oil producing country.

 Is it also true that the youths are sitting down doing nothing? 2019 election will answer that I hope!

- Doing nothing about the abducted Chibok girls
- Meddling with our judicial system

9035 2018-04-19 07:53:00 Sometimes I wished oil was never discovered in Nigeria because it's has been more of a curse than a blessing to Average Nigerians.

Who actually relies on oil? 

The Nigerian youth or Buhari? 
9042 2018-04-19 07:52:18 This was pre-WWI, so not sure it would hold then? Or might it? They were using fairly low quantities, e.g. in 1910 Tasmanian Railways used 276 gallons of red machinery oil compared to over 10,000 gallons of kerosene and 4,000 of castor oil.

This 15% number is a flat out lie.
9080 2018-04-19 07:47:36 Palm oil is actually the most efficient source of farmed oil. Forcing a switch to other plants means more land needs to be cleared for the same about of oil.

9126 2018-04-19 07:40:02 Yeah, used to work for an art store. Had to explain to folks about oil drying times. And they never dry fully - if you put them behind glass, make sure there's spacers or you'll ruin the painting.

9141 2018-04-19 07:38:03 And all we do is send our oil offshore for refining and buy it back. Why don’t we make a few demands on them after becoming more self sufficient?
9142 2018-04-19 07:37:54 We need oil. I support Canadian oil industry. Family & friend in the industry. But until I see a government publish a real plan to reduce Canadian emission to levels inline with our targets. None of it will have my support.

9267 2018-04-19 07:16:49 @mungaikihanya @SokoAnalyst  3) My concern is whether the President was duped into announcing the listing of National Oil Corporation in the two bourses without clear information and facts.

9270 2018-04-19 07:16:29 Short sighted. That's one of the reasons customers hate oil. Any smart businessman knows that raising prices is not a long term winning strategy, whatever the excuse for it.

9287 2018-04-19 07:14:10 As per reuters, resource stocks were on a roll in Asia on Thursday as oil prices hit heights not seen since late 2014 and ignited a rally across commodities, though the potential boost to inflation globally also put some pressure on fixed-income assets.

@SokoAnalyst  As far as I know, and available information in the markets, National Oil Corporation has not in the last five yrs made profit. Its balance sheet has been in the red and I wonder who will put money in a company with unhealthy books.

9305 2018-04-19 07:11:11 #MYN This is looking very good as they expected to make a margin at $30 oil. With more wells to be put into production imminently the news flow should get even better. Asphalt Ridge should give a major boost when they release news of full production commencement.

9318 2018-04-19 07:08:34 The Nigerian Govt is lazy  and clueless in my opinion. They should go n fix  Ajeokuta steel industry and other Natural resource centres.

9530 2018-04-19 06:33:27 while the world relies on oil nothing will change in Saudi.

9536 2018-04-19 06:32:25 Hey @CoriumSkincare 
So my journey with you guys has been amazing so far 

I have been using the black soap, tamanu oil and the lemon brightening serum so far and I'm loving the results.

I have a bit of acne scarring and dark marks, what else can I use for this?

9538 2018-04-19 06:32:16 Yeah we know it's not friendly why do you think we're building a treatment facility in victoria now. Just look at all the contamination near oil wells and all the leaks that happen from pipelines can poison the earth and water. That makes agriculture difficult.

She: "Hmm...thanks." 

Later, she to another lady.

"I don't know why babes like to lie. Common body cream, she can't tell me."

Lesson: Some girls dislike the truth.

9563 2018-04-19 06:26:49 Everything isn't snake oil - one of the key problems here is that there's a piece missing. These products CAN have value, but often, orgs don't have the necessary skill or time to configure them correctly. Often, they're not tested to make sure they're working properly.
9564 2018-04-19 06:26:41 Looked at #JOG lately for #oil exposure bud?

Given the worst case NPV for Verbier, I don’t think there’s any downside, unless something seriously unexpected happens?!

9654 2018-04-19 06:11:22 #GirlTalkZA Castor Oil is the plug for my hair. I mixed it in  Garnier Ultimate Blends Moisturiser with Avocado & Shea Butter for very dry and damaged hair. I have very dry sculp and it is working wonders. I've been using it for a month now.
9655 2018-04-19 06:11:09 @NexaExperience very bad service by Sai Service of Porvorim, Goa. My New Baleno free service they gave it back with all oil patches on the body and seat.  Poor service

9668 2018-04-19 06:09:49 #India imports 83% of its #oil and pays $88 billion to other nations even when we have over 75 billion barrels of oil-equivalent resources. It’s time to support domestic players with policies that ensure energy self-sufficiency in India.

9671 2018-04-19 06:09:18 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
9672 2018-04-19 06:09:17 Those citizens who survive in areas of high deprivation who voted for Trump should take a moment to look at the opulence that surrounds him.

9723 2018-04-19 06:00:12 I know. I’ve seen other things regarding its production and it ain’t good. That we video was to balance out my contempt for it. I hope it’s better than I think but I don’t think so. Hemp oil could replace it

9732 2018-04-19 05:57:34 It’s not good for dry skin cause it doesn’t moisturize deeply enough and it’s terrible if you’re acne prone. I suggest organic face serums/moisturizers. If you prefer natural oils, olive oil is better- Argan oil, rose oil, tea tree oil(great for acne) are great too.

9735 2018-04-19 05:57:06 Does that decided by @narendramodi ?
Do you know about global crud oil prices?

Concerning taxes, 
Why other parties not agree to bring it under GST? Let people choose BJP in @BJP4Karnataka , 22 states will be in support for GST of petrolium
9736 2018-04-19 05:57:02 Demand for health services is fairly predictable in the short to medium term based on population growth, age/burden of disease of the population served. So is supply. It’s determined by gov. We’re not talking oil and gas here.

9745 2018-04-19 05:55:47 We need a full and public inquiry into the oil and gas industry in Canada! Is it operated in the interest of Canadians? Are prices fixed illegally? Is there a more beneficial way to conduct the business? Should the subsidies paid out result in an equity position?
9746 2018-04-19 05:55:41 Ah confession time

(3) softening in EU economic growth;
(4) German 10y yield 0.5%;
(5) highest spread US-German 10y yield for a while;
(6) stocks in a good shape!
The least bad: to have US 10y yield at 3.25% now!!!

9754 2018-04-19 05:55:17 certainly my life isn't dependent on it but we're using it just the same.  Where's the sense using foreign oil rather than our own?  If you can answer that, I'm listening.

9766 2018-04-19 05:52:53 It's because of the length of your journeys. There is a fault with RR with the new engine. I have a similar issue. You need to do over 15 miles in a journey to let the adblue do it's job or it contaminates the engine oil. LR/Jag know about this fault and continue to sell cars.
9767 2018-04-19 05:52:39 yes totally!! many essential oils actually control excess facial oils and help reducing your pimples! the best ones for oily skins are tea tree oil, lavender oil and jojoba oil!

9771 2018-04-19 05:52:29 1/My honest question to you Brett. Why is the Canadian government putting up with this global war on Canadian oil. We have the best standards and practices in the world. Would it be that we can produce the most ethical oil at the lowest cost of any other nation?
9772 2018-04-19 05:52:23 Damn right. These 'journalists' should be held to account. I see the NZD has taken a slight turn for the worse (at least against the AUD) following last week's gas/oil announcement. Such disastrous decisions will ultimately send the economy and NZD tanking.

9783 2018-04-19 05:50:07 AMERICA IS TOO GREEDY TO KILL BIN LADEN! HIS FAMILY OWNS TOO MUCH OIL, & MONEY!
9784 2018-04-19 05:50:06 Says a 122 follower spokesman for the oil industry. I have researched the subject and the vast majority are very much against the pipieline as I would be, such intrusion & sense of entitlement are wholly unacceptable in the 21st Century.
9785 2018-04-19 05:49:55 Unfortunately there are no alternatives right now. Period. The pipelines are safer then having it transported by rail and trucks. Oil and it’s by products are in your home, vehicle, bike, shoes etc. BC needs to wake up
9786 2018-04-19 05:49:51 You’ll sleep so fire after some NyQuil then laying down with some oil diffused aromatherapy and rain sounds playing on hifi speakers
9787 2018-04-19 05:49:48 I sat and watched the colors on my oil diffuser change for probably 10 minutes and I was literally so happy I cried.
9788 2018-04-19 05:49:42 The biggest factor for the price rise since last summer is the collapse of Venezuelan exports/production. If Saudi were reasonable and understood that the last thing the world economy needs right now is an oil shock, they would compensate for it. But they’re greedy instead...
9789 2018-04-19 05:49:31 If you call devasting the environment and pimping out our natural resources to big oil accomplishments then ok he’s accomplished huge amounts of devastation
9790 2018-04-19 05:49:21 オイルbotって何⁇とよく聞かれますが、…オイルはオイルですYO

9796 2018-04-19 05:47:44 the eco styler gel, the black castor oil & flaxseed oil one is great. It keeps my hair soft, but it doesn’t have that maximum hold unless you use a lot. Where can I get ORS?

9798 2018-04-19 05:47:14 Summary is that we are a lazy set of people expecting the government to help all of us because we are an oil producing nation. He said we should go and work and help ourselves.
9799 2018-04-19 05:47:09 Yes and yet we are letting migrants come in from other countries and handing them the keys to a house and a full tank of oil for heating! There is not a housing crisis in Ireland. There is a priority crisis. #IrelandforIrish #PriorityCrisis #Ireland
9800 2018-04-19 05:47:03 you wash it to get rid of dirt, sweat etc. But it also removes the natural oil/grease, for the other hair it's no problem as it's shorter and has another structure than beard-hair. If I apply oil it gets softer, doesn't split an is less "struppig" (in my experience)
9801 2018-04-19 05:46:51 NAHI.................! WAIT TILL CRUDE OIL SATTLE
9802 2018-04-19 05:46:51 I love rubbing baby oil gel all over my legs after I shave them

9808 2018-04-19 05:45:56 Trump said he's been tough on Russia by building up the military, creating vast amounts of oil & raising billions of $'s for NATO. Wow, Russia must really be hurting from all that. Hey Trump if you really wanted to be tough on Russia you would impose sanctions.
9809 2018-04-19 05:45:48 Buhari: Many Nigerian youth haven’t been to school — they want to sit and do nothing bcos of oil money

IS BUHARI RIGHT OR WRONG?
9810 2018-04-19 05:45:45 So after a decade a fair chance Vancouver will replace Exxon Valdez in the public's mind when they hear oil spill on the west coast.
9811 2018-04-19 05:45:34 Love them, hate them, nurses are the oil that lubricates the HDS....look how it has come to a complete  standstill in state run institutions. I feel for the majority who can't afford the private facilities fees. Lord have mercy on us.
9812 2018-04-19 05:45:32 Keep tabs on Commodity oil stock as crude retraces back to $100.00 (Pre Sept 2014 oil prices) XOM, Rig, SDRL, CVX; etc.. ) . Era of cheap oil over!!!

ive never made anything like this before, it's really interesting but really good
9822 2018-04-19 05:43:55 Nonsense! Are they sharing the money from cattle sales the same way oil money is being shared????? Nigeria is fraud
9823 2018-04-19 05:43:54 I’d believe that 90% of the people who think whiteness is a thing they have support him.

9842 2018-04-19 05:39:38 What's his recipe for creating tremendous, vast amounts of oil?
9843 2018-04-19 05:39:33 So you swish coconut oil in your mouth in the AM for 20 minutes every day before you eat or drink anything. It pulls all of the toxins from your throat/mouth and whitens the fuck out of your teeth in as lil as 3 days.
9844 2018-04-19 05:39:31 Or we could cut corporate taxes to 7.5% and have a dictatorship like the Uzbeks. Maybe that's too distasteful?
Just an oil backed monarchy that uses indentured labour like Qatar? Then you could cut them to 10%.
Seriously you guys are children driving a tank and it's scary
9845 2018-04-19 05:39:30 “Ah, but the chemicals are nasty”. Yes, a bit like oil eh? Besides, once this stuff is out of the ground it can largely be recycled, unlike oil. Once it is out of the ground it largely need not create toxic waste issues (unlike oil).
9846 2018-04-19 05:39:25 New episode. Now the talk is about incorporating cannabis oil with sex
9847 2018-04-19 05:38:51 Poor fool Brew had to block and run for the hills, like the ALPHA that he is!  Hopefully the snake oil he gets from Infowars heals his burns.
9848 2018-04-19 05:38:19 You didn't anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment. Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little." He said to her, "Your sins are forgiven."
9849 2018-04-19 05:38:10 How is it that a caretaker government can put their hands into the kitty to pay off the oil companies for the increase? Thought being in this position they have no authority.
9850 2018-04-19 05:38:02 We don’t want to start going yet, but keep the oil in the engine
9851 2018-04-19 05:37:38 Just think how much better the world would be had Exxon not buried electric car patent in 1963 and Ford would expand its hydrogen engine. Green energy is right in our grasps, stop caving in to big oil.

9856 2018-04-19 05:36:44 @OilPriceHourly @GarethAFuller what happened to the oil price hourly? it’s not been updated for couple of days now.
9857 2018-04-19 05:36:26 ... increased use of renewables is important then there is a greater good argument from an industry trying to be responsible.  I’m sure that were we THAT concerned over the fate of children then we’d also look to Nigerian oil fields and their damage.
9858 2018-04-19 05:36:17 I want that money to supply fresh safe drinking water to all Canadians instead of going toTexas oil men!  That would be a travesty!

9861 2018-04-19 05:35:21 Are you hurting? Pray. Do you feel great? Sing. Are you sick? Call the church leaders together to pray and anoint you with oil in the name of the Lord. Believing-prayer will heal you, and Jesus will put you on your feet. And if you’ve sinned, you’ll be forgiven,healed inside out.

9873 2018-04-19 05:33:49 So under trump, our troops' lives are being risked to protect foreign oil from being seized by Russian Oligarchs, dictators that murder their adversaries AND their citizens, often w/Chemical Weapons, but he'll impose sanctions "as soon as they very much deserve it"? 
Got it. 
9874 2018-04-19 05:33:32 And gas prices are being kept atificially high by oil companies shutting down refineries for "maintenance" which reduces production of refined products keeping prices of fuel high.

9880 2018-04-19 05:32:31 They started investing when the oilsands were boomed in 2013 when oil was going for $80+ a barrel. At current prices it's not feesible and seeing the new reserves being discovered and tapped into in the world those prices are not coming back anytime soon.

9913 2018-04-19 05:27:11 No, it’s not creative at all. Shit, UK is an island with no oil, virtually everything that’s there, from pavement to food is dependent on oil pipelines and tankers. You have the North Sea oil fields, is there a legit reason why Canada can’t sell our oil???

9922 2018-04-19 05:26:13 What country would you want to own Arsenal? I think Saudi Arabia is ok, they have some oil.
9923 2018-04-19 05:26:07 you print them out of what? straw? I'm guessing oil is involved there somehow. Which is why we will still be talking about pipelines for quite a while.
9924 2018-04-19 05:25:55 I’m pretty sure I have an essential oil for that....

9927 2018-04-19 05:25:29 How can FGN be responsible?????? Please pick up a book on Oil & Gas Exploration History, probably get another one on the murder of Ken Saro Wiwa and another on why the National Assembly has refused to pass the PIB. Cheers
9928 2018-04-19 05:25:22 World oil consumption will rise by 20-30 mmm/d by 2040. Not using Canadian oil will increase global GHGs.
9929 2018-04-19 05:25:19 Would India also try to procure more Iranian oil at a discount as China does?
9930 2018-04-19 05:25:02 Lol.. These physical oil traders just love the words demurrage,  transit loss, SIDL and tank top.. As momok.

Adik2.. Abang dulu waktu muda muda hidup makan tido on physical oil trading tau. Bukan buat paper je.  Toksah kelentong. Surveyor kencing pon ramai.

9932 2018-04-19 05:24:39 Can I ask in all innocent curiosity about the different ways they get them? I never had them or wanted to, but I seem to recall hearing back when I was in high school some of the white alternative kids put like oil or wax to get them started?... I might be wrong, it’s been awhile

9945 2018-04-19 05:22:05 So you're saying destroy the environment for money and the government can subsidize the oil industry at cost to us so they can move their uneconomical product to buyers that will only buy it because it's subsidized. Sounds like a great plan for all canadians.
9946 2018-04-19 05:21:48 Division, says the member for Shuswap will have kids that are writing this down. That was the Oil and Gas Activities Act. The fact of 1/3
9947 2018-04-19 05:21:41 It’s called free trade. NAFTA designates where oil goes, it’s sent to the global markets. It’s cheaper to buy Saudi oil and have it shipped here. 
It has nothing to do with Alberta or Canada. It’s how free trade works. 
We would have to drop out of NAFTA and nationalize our oil.

9971 2018-04-19 05:17:52 The entire oil glut is gone... If US doesn't renew the NPT pact with Iran on 12th May, b/w 0.5-1mmbbl per day of supply will go out in next 9-12 months. Unless US shale compensates, we are looking @$80-85/bbl by end May based on US decision. Bad for inflation, CAD, exchange rate.

9978 2018-04-19 05:15:55 But where did he wrong? Those of us who have lived in Bayelsa and Warri can write a book on how women and aged men work harder than young boys who are waiting to shut down plants and demand for money from oil companies. They make 50% of the youths there.
