6 2018-12-01 23:08:40 The point is that commodities can’t possibly be a “right”, as by definition commodities are limited. In other words, someone has to produce them. If a commodity ceases to be produced, saying one has a “right” to it is meaningless.

We'll be trading with cigarettes, food & other life life sustaining commodities.  If you're hungry a piece of silver or gold isn't going to cut it.

38 2018-12-01 22:05:46 Yo creo que es un llamado de atención a lo fácil que es decir que hay que dejar de exportar commodities y agregar mas valor. Ver que cuando alguien se la juega por un proyecto innovador, puede ir bien o muy mal incluso para quienes conocen bien su negocio
39 2018-12-01 22:01:40 It’s my theory that eventually the USD (fiat currency) will be replaced with a Fed-controlled cryptocurrency. A crypto would enable them to squeeze out underground and black market trade. At that time, only commodities and barter would be remaining means of private trade.
40 2018-12-01 21:53:36 Guardatelo. Spiega come funzionano le commodities benissimo.
41 2018-12-01 21:50:53 the more you live, the more you see that the human race has corrupted itself with farcical notions of freedom which solely rely on the wherewithal to buy commodities.
42 2018-12-01 21:39:29 Rule #128: Secrets are commodities, sell them.
43 2018-12-01 21:33:06 So far BTC exactly followed its own previous bear market path. Gold and BTC are commodities of different class and age. Plus what's the point of keeping BTCs price suppressed "for years" if "cartel", as you say, can make mega $ again by repeating the same trick as with 20k?
44 2018-12-01 21:25:31 Is this the guy who likes to think he had a proper job, producing nothing of tangible value, speculating on commodities in The City?
45 2018-12-01 21:14:05 Alan sólo siguió el modelo del piloto automático, y los precios altos de los commodities. Para nada tiene que ver con la gestión de este paquidermo cobarde

47 2018-12-01 21:03:30 The all idea is to create an investment opportunities for youths in which they can be empowered through creation of various industries of commodities. It will give youths otopportunities to reduce unemployment through sustainable income generation.
48 2018-12-01 21:00:38 I'd argue that literally every investor today has to be a global investor to understand what's going on - certainly in markets like energy and commodities, but also to take advantage of where we think the best opportunities are going to be.  - John Burbank

51 2018-12-01 20:40:20 I'll read it with an open mind, I reacted to the precis. But the algebra has now gone beyond Sraffa's understanding, e.g. his production prices are proportional to the labour time supplied to produce commodities.
52 2018-12-01 20:26:44 @SimonCowell if you took better care of your signed artist as opposed to treating them like commodities, perhaps artists like @FleurEast may well be making music successfully.

53 2018-12-01 20:13:02 No es que la paguen a sobreprecio, por que el azúcar, al ser commodities, tiene precio internacional.
Es el sobrecoge que le mete el régimen al azucar importado, y hacer ver a la población, que le están reventando con los precios.
Ese beneficio extra queda en algún banco.
54 2018-12-01 20:02:51 Yuan already down, what, 10-11% in less than a year. Drop in commodities buys them time. Again, doesn't stop them from undergoing another 2001. Likely far worse then expected. I reckon the most recent collapse out of bitcoin and ethereum is Asian capital flight.
55 2018-12-01 19:57:02 I realize that animal hairs and furs are popular commodities. But have we ever even considered human hair? Specifically baby hair. Who wouldn’t want a baby hair scarf? Leave your response in the comments below.
56 2018-12-01 19:50:57 This is a very sinful idea have u asked yourself questions about those innocent Zimbabweans who do not have access to hard currency.. Have you asked yourself about innocent Zimbabwe suffering to get basic commodities... Think about wer they can access the money
57 2018-12-01 19:40:49 No sé de qué commodities hablaban. Aceros y aluminio han ido a la alza, mayormente por tarifas. Cu bajó todo 1H’18 y se estabilizó por China el resto del año, maderas y papeles a la alza en 2H’18. El petróleo ha estado arriba de los precios de 2017 pero con subidas y bajadas.
58 2018-12-01 19:39:57 It will never cease to amaze me that #Sooners don’t treat timeouts like precious commodities. This is a horrible time to take one. Good lord.
59 2018-12-01 19:37:27 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
60 2018-12-01 19:35:54 2. The fact that fiat can be printed or typed in infinitum, and the fact that currency is used to trade all other commodities, leaves open the possibility of market manipulation on a large scale.

64 2018-12-01 19:01:02 Gotta love these politicians. When commodities are in demand world wide, it’s easy to manage. When commodities turn south, this guy bails because he knows the electorate will turn on him when they see he’s nothing.

I "did not" anonymously pay salaries to people in random other countries to work on various software projects for me.
70 2018-12-01 18:24:05 Rules of origin can't be over emphasizes. How much input must be sourced locally or regionally. Those with manufacturing base can source commodities from each other. If foreign companies relocate and localize production it's a win. Technology transfer, jobs.

80 2018-12-01 17:08:28 Interessante! Tenho visto uns dados para analisar a queda, e acrescentaria que, embora não tenha afetado em termos reais, a queda do preço das commodities impactam muito a renda. A queda do consumo pode ter vindo muito dessa frente. Grande problema de depender delas pra crescer
81 2018-12-01 16:55:58 Also the overtly disastrous war on drugs, which, BTW, is responsible for the refugee crisis, and which is a front for covertly profiteering in a wildly profitable black market—to say nothing of private prisons.

120 2018-12-01 13:46:26 Why taking forex when USD and Bond notes have been declared the same by RBZ? I was thinking it’s better be a crime of selling commodities in forex because it is in direct contravention with the implemented legislation!
121 2018-12-01 13:40:28 Patience and faith you will win in the end are rare commodities these days
122 2018-12-01 13:36:18 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.

124 2018-12-01 13:20:25 True and since January we are in a trial and error and no really effort to turn around the ailing ecnmy. The taxing things sent prizes skyrocketing and disappearance of basic commodities. Now USD duty An ordinary man will still cling to his USD and live for another day with bond

129 2018-12-01 12:47:50 1. Boom de commodities
2. PBI inflado por celulosa, que no genera divisas para Uruguay
130 2018-12-01 12:46:59 Devaluar? Estás hablando de CFK? Quemó las reservas, dejó pasar los años récords de commodities, no industrializó, agigantó al Estado, empezó a emitir, se fue con una inflación acumulada del 550%, con un déficit de 7 puntos y con 30% de pobres, estúpido mononeuronal.
131 2018-12-01 12:46:14 Hay casi 600.000 personas con problemas de empleo (desempleados, subempleados y en negro). Cifras oficiales. Después de la bonanza más grande de los últimos 100 años. Boom de commodities, le llamaron
132 2018-12-01 12:41:53 Some of us don't think about crypto like commodities and speculative investments. We really want it to be money/fuel and that's it. We want it to replace our need for using fiat, not our means of making more fiat.

177 2018-12-02 22:03:39 Because there aren’t resources available to buy and develop. Most countries, under-developed and developing, don’t have real resource availability...skilled labour, commodities, energy sources. Nor do they have developed institutional structures.
178 2018-12-02 21:51:52 Remember guys, buying local produce and American products = less distance travel and therefore less co2 emissions. Buy products that are gonna last and try to avoid temporary commodities until you can afford a long term one. Borrow/rent when you rarely need it. Reusable>singleuse
179 2018-12-02 21:47:36 Commodities are things the world competes for.
180 2018-12-02 21:38:23 I’m talking about the Y axis of your graph: it should start at zero, not because commodities ever cost zero, but because starting the Y axis at $6 is misleading w/r/t the change over time. Starting at $6 makes small differences look larger than they are.
181 2018-12-02 21:32:16 Es importante saber si en el G20 se discutieron temas que preocupan a la Argentina, a Latinoamérica y a los países en vías de desarrollo: el futuro del trabajo, migrantes, exportar productos industriales (trabajo argentino) y no solo commodities.

E mesmo assim o Sonegador analfabeto vai acabar com o Brasil

188 2018-12-02 20:53:13 Wonder how such idiots from Congress want to rule a state with no knowledge in the head! how does policies of state curb inflation? prices of most commodities are similar almost in all states so vasundara is responsible for prices? Dumb getting dumber in congress! Pappu effect
189 2018-12-02 20:52:58 China has agreed only to increase imports of commodities it has no intention of ever developing internally: soybeans, crude oil and industrial products.
190 2018-12-02 20:48:39 Sim ; estão baixos e com certeza é desesperador. O mercado é cruel mas justo. Sempre devemos observar a oferta e a procura. São eliminados do mercado quem não fez uma reserva de caixa ; tanto produtores de commodities quanto consumidores.
191 2018-12-02 20:44:45 Legado do PT: 16 mais proficuos anos em financiamento, boom de commodities, e o Brasil? Crescimento de 40% contra 80% da AmericaLatina e 280% da Koreia.

195 2018-12-02 20:26:09 El Gobierno no está viendo que la Argentina es el país más conectado del Mercosur y el 3ro en ventas por Internet de LATAM. El mercado digital podría superar a los commodities en 5 años si fuésemos estratégicos, replicando modelo de Chile, Israel, Gran Bretaña, España o India.
196 2018-12-02 20:24:46 I think the Front Office would be a deal breaker for most known commodities.  The QB situation going forward is horrible...
197 2018-12-02 20:17:42 To be honest, there are some clubs who treat their players like commodities so I wouldn’t blame them if they just care about the money.
198 2018-12-02 20:10:33 "themselves" as individuals and not commodities or "live stock". FYI that isn't a chicken.... 
199 2018-12-02 20:10:29 Ou seja, é preciso esquecer a ideologia e focar nos números. Precisamos da China e Índia para vender commodities. E eles precisam do Brasil para a sua segurança alimentar. Então não seria o obvio focar nessas relações bilaterais?
200 2018-12-02 20:07:33 The Left believes commodities like Healthcare and Birth Control can become rights and rights like free speech and the bearing of arms can become commodities.
201 2018-12-02 19:49:57 A ideia de que país não pode se desenvolver sendo produtor de alimentos (sendo um "pasto") é errada. A nova zelandia por exemplo, não é rica por ser uma grande PRODUTORA de tecnologia, e sim por produzir commodities com o AUXÍLIO de tecnologias para aumentar a produtividade
202 2018-12-02 19:30:16 Deflation is caused by saving money under the pillow, or in commodities
203 2018-12-02 19:23:10 Klingt eher wie die Aussage eines Casinosüchtigen. Risiken herunterspielen, Gewinne hervorheben. Es ist nicht Staatsaufgabe, Zocker zu alimentieren. Egal ob Pferdewetten, Pokern, Future Options auf Commodities oder Aktien: Glücksspiele gehören besteuert.
204 2018-12-02 19:21:31 I went thinking it was a seminar on commodities trading
205 2018-12-02 19:21:14 The specific point on China shows up in industries like Semiconductors, Smartphones, automotive and commodities. These cyclical industries are already under pressure and facing fundamental slowing in their businesses and therefore cash flows.
206 2018-12-02 19:16:51 Le politiche anti dumping americane servono a regolare il libero scambio, non a negarlo. Poi, mi permetta, che Malesia, Taiwan e Messico sostengano le proprie economie sulle commodities non mi sembra esatto. Venga a KL a vedere una classe media in crescita
207 2018-12-02 19:14:20 It's going to be a buy everything market again....including commodities! Silver and gold this is your month!
208 2018-12-02 19:13:18 90 days truce between China and US over trade war should bode well for commodities tomorrow! Hopefully see an improvement in #copper and #kazminerals
209 2018-12-02 19:12:25 Sunday night calls are sharply higher on US/China 90 day truce ,#soybeans up 20to cents, corn up 5 to 10 cents ,wheat up 8 to 15 cents. #China agrees to yet to be announced agriculture ,energy,other products.
China agrees to reduce trade imbalance, IT issues, funds caught short.
210 2018-12-02 19:06:35 I was researching the commodities market for wheat & sugar & somehow stumbled across ur Oatmeal Cinnamon Bread recipe. LOL. I've never baked in my life but ur recipe looks so tasty, & more importantly EASY, that I'm giving it a shot. Going to the store now. fingersX
211 2018-12-02 18:59:55 Poor systems to distribute the wealth of commodities as well, created in my opinion a welfare state and the population aren't too innovative or have need to be
212 2018-12-02 18:56:31 But... inelastic vs elastic demand. Consumers can’t “shop around” in situations where they can’t easily walk away, like healthcare decisions. 

Markets are good for some commodities (iPhones, Doritos...), but are not a good fit for exchanges with disparate bargaining power.
213 2018-12-02 18:51:33 It's always about control and money makes it harder to control, so they keep us poor.  The futures, stocks, commodities aren't really helping the producers.
214 2018-12-02 18:47:27 Consumer benifits from
lower prices. We have too much poppulation working in farming and producing same commodities.
215 2018-12-02 18:45:04 I read an article discussing who the richest fictional character was recently. Scrooge McDuck was the #1 spot & I was like, “Obviously, he’s killing it in the commodities market with that vault of gold. That shit is recession proof!”
216 2018-12-02 18:43:45 And we had the chance to change in july,and some because felt otherwise,we are stuck.hopefuly that lot is getting commodities at a good price and life is smooth!
217 2018-12-02 18:33:49 Who would have guessed that the con game would have gone on for this long.  Commodities via miners are ridiculous cheap again.
218 2018-12-02 18:20:41 Also listing the major case of innovation becoming commodities vs exceptions is not aggressive, it’s making a good case. The evolution of mankind and knowledge is based on innovation becoming commodity and raising us up entirely as a species. Even wine.
219 2018-12-02 18:16:38 The breakeven cycle in commodities vs bitcoin:

Commodities => Price drops below BE => miners shut off => less supply => less inventory => price bounces (with prolonged lag)

BTC => Price drops below BE => miners shut off => less hashing power => lower difficulty => same supply
220 2018-12-02 18:12:00 The market is entirely speculative. The science will proceed but unless there is a compelling enonomic reason to buy synthetic wine who will buy it. Yes, scientific innovation evolves into commodities but markets determine what is needed. Don’t see the need.
221 2018-12-02 18:10:39 Depends on their cash position. This Cycle seems to be unfolding faster Ex-US (China) and now commodities so companies exposed there seem most at risk. Also depends on whether we get the Systemic Shock I think is likely. That could freeze credit markets for awhile hurting all cos
222 2018-12-02 17:53:34 Who cares about commodities Rick!! We are talking options and con man @smartertrader
223 2018-12-02 17:44:49 It’s just unlikely that: 1) Uber could pull off central kitchens across all cuisines 2) most consumers see food (esp specialized) as pure commodities 3) that the market would allow that / a competitor that sticks to branded will have an edge
224 2018-12-02 17:41:31 Hilarious commentary. Arbitrage! Futures trading! Commodities! Interstellar war!
225 2018-12-02 17:39:28 Uno de los efectos del crecimiento económico q experimentó el Peru, como consecuencia del precio de los commodities, fue q nos creímos el cuento del milagro latinoamericano y convertimos al Estado en incapaz (1/3)
226 2018-12-02 17:33:32 Sadly these commodities are interlinked. They can not be treated in isolation...
227 2018-12-02 17:31:52 I’m just giving context on the price of French fuel in US dollars and gallons. Of course the price goes down as you trend backwards, but the commodities scale does not begin at zero
228 2018-12-02 17:31:37 Communism assumes all property, wealth, and commodities are shared equally amongst the people and the people work to support the necessities of society- please point to the democrats or the democratic platform that supports this?
229 2018-12-02 17:28:08 Eagerly waiting to see this week's agri commodities price performance after happy ending to Trump-Xi meeting@G20 BA! Overwhelming short positions in Soy complex will be sth quite interesting to keep an eye on!
230 2018-12-02 17:26:06 I tried to defintely keep the long term projection in tact but of course in the short run it’s a tightening cycle so I’m not exactly bullish on commodities until that trend changes. 
But I’ll try to improve upon that - thanks for reading
231 2018-12-02 17:04:58 Ha,$GS Dec 2017

Strong global demand growth across raw materials said in a Dec. 11 2017 report, maintaining its 12-mon overweight recommendation on commodities. Goldman sees returns of 7.5% in 2018, driven by backwardation that’ll lead to a positive roll yield

232 2018-12-02 16:56:23 Today India is a leading producer of several food commodities – cereals, fruits, vegetables, milk, eggs and fish. In the crop year 2017-18, food grain production has reached 284.83 million tonnes, a new record.
233 2018-12-02 16:54:22 I wonder if you realize how big of an impact real life commodities mining has on the environment
234 2018-12-02 16:53:22 Agreed, I meant that we can go for commodities having international markets….but, then we would need efficient farming techniques too, to keep the inputs in check
235 2018-12-02 16:49:23 Plus, the uranium market is probably the most inelastic and least transparent of all the commodities. I believe that is what will drive spot price to extreme overvaluation. Can you imagine if we saw the number of physical uranium holding funds rise to even a quarter of the ICOs?
236 2018-12-02 16:44:02 60% do nosso PIB vem das commodities. 
Estamos no início de mais uma safra de soja (que se estima que seja recorde) e sem o acordo os preços na Bolsa de Chicago (CBOT) estão virando pó... se o acordo não sai, o agronegócio vai sofrer (quase quebrar) e precisar de mais $$
237 2018-12-02 16:43:55 The rising cost of commodities  largely due to Trump's 25 percent tariff on imported steel – took a bite out of General Motors during the second quarter.  GM turned a $2.4 billion profit for the quarter, the company on Wednesday reported $300 million in increased commodity costs,
238 2018-12-02 16:29:21 Commodities continue rising, Fuel still in short supply and Salaries and Wages remain as it is, Bond note continue to lose value against USD, Workers still paid in RTGS n No meaningful intervention from the powers that be. We felt short changed as a nation. #CrymybelovedZim
239 2018-12-02 16:28:20 @PMOIndia sir thanks ur our prime minster but u r not think about essential commodities of daily usage of gas& petrol u thinking 5₹ time is u r having still 6 months work more not speech pm Modi sir 
240 2018-12-02 16:23:29 Mr President 
Please impose BAN on non essential commodities
241 2018-12-02 16:19:50 Yes vegans have reason to dislike wool. It's because it has been industrialised and demand has turned sheeps lives into commodities for wool production rather than living, feeling beings.
242 2018-12-02 16:17:16 Without the Fed the market would always find and adjust rates and even inflation. Downturns would be short and sharp, recoveries quicker. I like the idea of a basket of commodities backing currency also, it's a good idea
243 2018-12-02 16:02:29 Hmmm.. Goldman is super bullish on Commodities for 2019.
244 2018-12-02 16:02:01 Exato. Nunca vi fornecedor de commodities ter grande poder de barganha.
245 2018-12-02 15:56:41 Exactly, deregulating a scarce commodity is an invitation to chaos and price anarchy to the detriment of the poor and fixed salary earners. Diversification and improve local production should precede deregulation, especially for essential commodities.
246 2018-12-02 15:52:39 It's simple, Eddie.
If the yuan rallies, gold and commodities will rally, too. However, if the yuan falls and USDCNH pushes toward 7 instead, commodities and gold will fall in dollar terms.
247 2018-12-02 15:46:25 Burning & front burner issues, the incumbent govt is facing are; shrinking investment, export & remittances on one hand, rising inflation, energy prices & skyrocketing prices of all other edibles &commodities on the other,still all emphasis are being wasted on back burner issues!
248 2018-12-02 15:44:06 supply move from investment assets and education to daily goods and commodities. Hard to call inflating the currency supply ‘prudent’ when it wouldn’t have been necessary on a sound money system to begin with.
249 2018-12-02 15:37:48 Neither are commodities
250 2018-12-02 15:32:46 The workers keep their jobs, but the companies would have a government controlling interest in order to fix prices of essential commodities. You may not agree personally, but polling shows most people in the UK are in favour of nationalising essential commodities.
251 2018-12-02 15:29:30 Those are worldwide commodities and their trade ends up governed by rather different rules. Also extractive, not productive.
252 2018-12-02 15:29:17 Results in a nutshell:
US: Sell more AG products, get Fentanyl listed in China, Energy and Commodities sales, IP Theft and other technology investigations....
China: no tariffs for 90 days
I would have to say this is a win
253 2018-12-02 15:26:10 Okay isu tiri pwere tinoita ma demostrations. Ko imi vanhu vakuru maitei ne ma fuel & cash shortages, increase of prices of basic commodities. The life of an ordinary citizens is now hard. It was once easy when pwere idzi was in gvt 2009  - 2013

255 2018-12-02 15:06:55 The farm bill is also this:

"And the Farm Bill, a giant $90-billion piece of policy, determines that taxpayers will subsidize the growing of GMO monoculture commodities—but not the growing of healthy, organic regenerative fruits and vegetables."
256 2018-12-02 14:52:16 @Statsfund I thought I read on Bloomberg China fixing buy more agriculture commodities.
257 2018-12-02 14:49:51 Trust, credibility and faith are very expensive commodities, don't expect them from cheap people. You out of all should know this. #lka #couplk #MY3Out
258 2018-12-02 14:45:50 Commodities are outside of their jurisdiction.
259 2018-12-02 14:42:15 except that the commodities are dug up by corporations that all siphon the profits through shell companies in the Cayman Islands and pay little to no tax in Australia....???
260 2018-12-02 14:39:20 Given the Mining Index has been strong I believe that also given the current price of iron ore and oil & other commodities, the @ASX may have some more of a correction as I believe that the ASX in the past of the Bull Run has been propped up by the mining sector?? @MarketMatters1
261 2018-12-02 14:32:14 A big issue early on could be logistics to get ships moving back to PNW, etc. It will take time to see if China starts buying commodities like corn and wheat again, which China stopped buying long before tariffs.
262 2018-12-02 14:31:50 A continued stress of Union Govt on manufacturing sectors engaged in the Nation or abroad by their MNC expension at global as global corporates and export of commodities & technology always as a ride on evolutions may prove a driving force to us to sustain all over evolutions.
263 2018-12-02 14:23:04 Question my opinion of how commodities will react to events of the G20, if this assists my Skype is lit up with investors in every continent waiting for the opening.

Bulls kicking in the stall.
264 2018-12-02 14:18:37 'Selling steel' is a massive oversimplification as controlling trade in commodities central to military equipment production would certainly be a step forward in reducing potential for conflict which was also a motivating factor. Inevitably the peace was due to many processes.
265 2018-12-02 14:02:59 Tyson Fury is truly one of the hottest commodities in boxing. He deserves it.
266 2018-12-02 13:49:01 Even then, they paid a somewhat premium price for commodities that are saturating the free agent market...
267 2018-12-02 13:48:20 -Increased input cost due 2 Crude COULDN’T b passed on fully, as also indicated by 7.1% Q2GDP +Liquidity Crunch
-Slackness in Commodities, esp. Steel

DEC LOWER: Diwali Holidays, sudden crude crash delaying purchases, unutilised credit 4m costlier inventory, & lower gst on output
268 2018-12-02 13:46:01 The market doesn't care about drill results. Especially with commodities that are at the bottom of cycles/trends. Hence drop. The only reason this has risen back from 6p is because Tops got involved.
269 2018-12-02 13:41:45 An economy that can no longer absorb the impact of sanctions, or tolerate artificially low prices for its commodities - the key economic driver. But these are just the effects of a broader malaise as you very correctly indicate.
270 2018-12-02 13:37:51 21. Fastest growing economy in Africa.

272 2018-12-02 13:33:42 Entre el solomillo y el panqueque no esperaba que se firme ningun acuerdo. Se sentaron las bases (que es lo importante). Tarifas quedan en 10, China se compromete a comprar commodities, se aprobaria la compra por parte de Qualcomm, etc etc.
273 2018-12-02 13:28:17 The signs of an emerging bull are everywhere.

The whole world's bearish . Commodity and resource hopefuls being pummelled. Commodities,IO etc on the floor . Trade negotiations  .Geopolitical risks. Plus a first term republican.

It's there if you look.
274 2018-12-02 13:27:47 double digit growth is just wishful thinking!can this happen when our economy veers round subsidies ,freebies and less prices of all sorts of commodities!
275 2018-12-02 13:19:09 I DID read your 1st tweet. Where is your 'evidence' that people buy these commodities 'instead' of food?
276 2018-12-02 13:01:14 Treating women like commodities is glorifying her going to work, fronting on friends, being a homebody, cooking, cleaning and loving scented candles ? Lmfaoo FOH with your rhetoric .... immediately though
277 2018-12-02 12:59:20 Until y'all stop treating women like commodities we'll do this everyday
278 2018-12-02 12:57:35 What is happening or has happenedin our country is very scary from water to electicity. Critical commodities needed by citizens n business.
279 2018-12-02 12:53:04 How will commodities react after G20?
280 2018-12-02 12:45:12 A #GreenNewDeal is about more than natural resources & good jobs. It’s about protecting our most precious commodities: our people & our future.
281 2018-12-02 12:40:51 Paul van laar's ultralight sleeping tent can quickly transform into an innovative mix of commodities and – by accident – stumbled on the imperative to extract as much capital from a plot while paying….
282 2018-12-02 12:33:23 Please help spread the word. This affects every single one of us. While one woman is for sale in the capitalist markets, all women become commodities - & that affects how men treat us. It should surprise no one that male VAWG is at epidemic levels when prostitution is normalised.
283 2018-12-02 12:06:00 Best time to enter the market is when brands trade close to multiples of commodities and best time to exit/avoid entering is when commodities trade at multiples deserved by brands. Everyone knows where we are now.
284 2018-12-02 12:05:02 Yeah. I would have to go back to road work.
If commodities dont change I might be going back while Farming
285 2018-12-02 11:59:11 O Pará é a grande alternativa para o escoamento das commodities brasileiras, e se destaca como solução para os gargalos logísticos que emperram o crescimento econômico
286 2018-12-02 11:58:58 Aparte la dependencia enérgetica, Europa todavía tiene un nivel muy elevado de dependencia fiananciera que le impide tomar decisiones autónomas con respecto al comercio de estos commodities.
287 2018-12-02 11:57:20 Control of commodities, such as entertainment, and access to commodities translates into control over people.

328 2018-11-30 21:37:15 We're still fighting for safe spaces. Women aren't looking to drive trans people out of their homes, towns, or countries. Women don't want to send trans people to death camps. Women don't want trans people as slaves or commodities or see them as inferior. Your comparison sucks.
329 2018-11-30 21:34:54 I mean, sure. When I listened to Linkin Park or STP back in the day I was rarely concerned with the mental health of the singers. I suppose that makes me a bad music fan too because I was treating the musicians as commodities. FF is a game
330 2018-11-30 21:34:39 Ah my bad just saw the energy commodities. Correct on the midstream language as well in v13. Previously just CF from qualifying activities involving energy commodities
331 2018-11-30 21:23:35 Appeal to nature is an invalid argument.  Animals are commodities under the herding culture of farming (birth of capitalism).  The planet/wildlife are too.  Vegans see wildlife, ecosystems & all animals as having intrinsic value, not mere possessions to exploit for personal gain.
332 2018-11-30 21:15:40 Random thought- Memphis should probably work out a handshake deal with Hugh Freeze to come home because the Tigers will probably beat UCF and Norvell will be one of the hottest commodities out there. They already missed him once when he was at Lambuth.
333 2018-11-30 21:09:26 I want to know what we could naturally become if we stopped treating animals as commodities and killing them... starting making magnetic cars, and plant hemp for the enviroment. Started integrating more holistic medicine...
How would we, as humans, naturally start to evolve...
334 2018-11-30 21:00:58 I agree, but I'm not convinced Trump's random tariffs on specific commodities are the best way to accomplish that.  IMO, a fair tariff policy would apply to every country based on wages and environmental practices.  high tariff for low wage, poor environment.  1/2
335 2018-11-30 20:59:56 Exercise and physical training is going to the ONE thing you cannot truly replace with gene editing

339 2018-11-30 20:21:51 Fuel is subsidized and it's not sustainable. It's better to sell it at a normal price where it becomes readily available. The prices of other commodities will go up but that's normal. We can't force the economy

352 2018-11-30 19:08:21 Wealth is not a thing; it's a conception of a thing. Actual material thing/service is a commodity. A capitalist(noun) must produce new wealth; it's for manufactures to supply commodities which is the harvesting of the value cultivated by the capitalist. Then the marketeers trade.

356 2018-11-30 18:44:09 It seems to me that the scope of things that 'are not commodities' is constantly expanding: the gov't should force everyone to pay for everyone else's travel, education, water, gas.  Why not say that leisure is 'a right' and get the gov't to pay for people's Spanish holidays.
357 2018-11-30 18:42:12 They shoulda monopolized an unsettled territory and set up a banking and commodities cartel then
358 2018-11-30 18:41:02 Fuel pricing angling towards dollarization. Duties ,taxes on most commodities now USD. Pricing of most products in shops is premised on a 1:3 rate. So technically it's a dollarized economy. The Greatest Thief of our time, the govt keeps stealing by paying civil servants in bond.

360 2018-11-30 18:35:33 Modern energy means going away as much as possible from commodities.
361 2018-11-30 18:35:23 Perhaps we need to advance a global norm that the ill-gotten gains from corruption-driven deforestation should not be purchased or traded by respectable parties? And then back it up with legal measures?Demand for commodities is undermining forest countries’ laws.
362 2018-11-30 18:33:39 His children were raised as he was, as FELONS.

Donald was a prepubescent felon, receiving fraudulent money transfers through shell companies existent only to mark up commodities for resale to the family business, evading income tax on those profits.

Sins of the father.
363 2018-11-30 18:30:42 Commodities in general.
364 2018-11-30 18:25:35 The resurgence of diseases that were thought to be eradicated (measles, mumps, chickenpox, pertussis and more) especially in wealthy areas ( who have the food safety, health care and other hygiene related commodities), but with low vaccination rates should be a big clue.
365 2018-11-30 18:14:10 The fact that you haven’t even seen what the final trade looks like and are crying says to me you don’t understand the business. At the end of the day it is a business and the Mets are giving up potentially 3 unknowns for 2 known commodities.
366 2018-11-30 18:13:55 We are agriculture country and we become prosperous with agriculture commodities like Australia and new zeland where they both provide milk and meat to world
367 2018-11-30 18:13:20 Fed gov receives billions in taxes from agricultural commodities and activities. They dump billions into such things as auto companies and oil subsidies. I don't feel too bad if thy put few million here and there back into agriculture. Especially in an area like plant breeding
368 2018-11-30 18:08:14 Whenever there is a loyalty program breach I’m always interested in this question: "Were my SPG loyalty program points misused?” Loyalty programs are valuable commodities worth targeting.
369 2018-11-30 18:07:49 I do. 

Everybody sucks at guessing the future. 

And #Goldman sucks at commodities.
370 2018-11-30 18:06:18 exactly! hooked on cheap commodities

373 2018-11-30 17:57:46 Cruelty has been normalized on industrial farms which treat animals like commoditiesWe shd hve the ethical responsibility to protect all animals from harminstead abhorrent acts of cruelty R committed every single year cause most people R only looking for an economic gain
374 2018-11-30 17:57:13 I think we need to strike a balance. Both are very important. If fuel prices shoot prices of most goods will follow suit including the medicines as well. I think the issue here is of over subsidising fuel. Goz is subsidising a lot of commodities!
375 2018-11-30 17:56:30 The coercive imposition of the market logic into learning saw university degrees become commodities, knowledge and learning marketised, staff outsourced, wages decline, pension funds robbed, teaching standards lowered and students in debt for life.
376 2018-11-30 17:56:08 Elimination of fractional reserve lending and the use of commodities would go a long way toward letting the public keep the purchasing power of their money.
377 2018-11-30 17:54:40 That medicine needs to be moved by me the purchaser to my mom in binga. I will need fuel for that...

I hear your opinion, but I challenge the premise. We cannot treat these issues in isolation. We need all these resources in their forms. That's why they thrive as commodities...
378 2018-11-30 17:47:52 Pa fuel vari kuona kuti 1:1 haiite cz they are buying with forex bt being sold here nema bond it's like giving us fuel for free 1ltr of petrol it's 3,50 under normal circumstances ,cz price of commodities have risen only fuel is cheap
379 2018-11-30 17:47:50 La caída de los commodities que hemos sido testigos durante todo este año y especialmente el #petróleo aunque sea manipulado por la #Opec no tiene mucha importancia. Porque lo relevante es crecimiento global y este ha sido corregido a la baja.
380 2018-11-30 17:45:57 Un paso mas a minimizar la exportación de commodities. Bien, vamos por mas tecnología, comida no va a faltar.
381 2018-11-30 17:44:31 It's not a business, this is a country. People, not commodities. People lives are being ruined. Trump only care for the Rich. Has no respect for middle class or poor people or Brown people. Be nice if he'd honestly say why .

383 2018-11-30 17:33:22 Level of expectation is very high but practically there has been no relief for common man. If there is something.. it is just on paper.. believe me.. nothing from common commodities has decreased...  a lot is expected from a man like you who is very down to earth #AskAsadUmar
384 2018-11-30 17:33:15 Thoughtful analysis, but I'm not yet sold on higher inflation. Fed has been hitting the brake at an accelerating rate (hikes & QT) for over a year with results showing in commodities, housing, autos, global PMI's. Cap. utilization and initial claims may have turned as well.
385 2018-11-30 17:30:46 Realmente é incrível a quantidade de análise lixo no mercado. A inflexão de 2016 de Brasil foi muito explicada na retomada de inflação no mundo/commodities/fluxo para Emergentes. Brasil foi a reboque e teve o alfa da troca de governo. Penso que essa discussão (eem) é essencial.
386 2018-11-30 17:28:50 Seriously?

Benefits to the US have been
- Increased total trade 
- increased exports
- Lower prices on essentials / commodities
- A healthier auto industry 
- Direct investment increases. 

It net created more jobs than were lost. Just different industries.
387 2018-11-30 17:28:14 Thats a good idea, but the old commodities were good solid food too.
388 2018-11-30 17:16:04 Sub commodities ki fluctuation chalti hai not just gold!!!
389 2018-11-30 17:14:57 Borrowing a quote from my new friend James Park, CEO of Garbanzo Mediterranean:  I like my data raw and my analytics well done. #fintech #commodities
390 2018-11-30 17:11:19 Precisely @maxnrgmax, the proverbial 'pick and shovel' and the race to economical and efficient desalination. 

Commodities, 'things people need'.

Wait until you get me talking about fertiliser. :)
391 2018-11-30 17:08:50 None of those proven commodities are 24
392 2018-11-30 17:06:34 Time will tell. Ppl made many wrong assumptions on other commodities.

Not trusting govt policies is a disease born to ignorance. Or prejudice. Or, both. The last is the only reason i can think of.
393 2018-11-30 17:06:15 It's the ironic part isn't it @maxnrgmax, because commodities get very little investor attention (as in money invested, not articles or 'likes') but it is 'what people need'. 

Water is the ultimate commodity but few understand. Yet.
394 2018-11-30 17:03:14 Well I mean even if u don’t want to say “career mediocre” how is a 3 year record like that for a reliever, who are typically sporadic, elite? There’s no excuse to trade for that and give up what you are, when there’s 3 proven commodities on the market
395 2018-11-30 17:01:57 And in commodities generally.
396 2018-11-30 17:00:17 From the prices of commodities, no one can tell.

400 2018-11-30 16:53:31 @PMOIndia Sir ,Agri commodities में Ncdex का Trading समय  बढ़ाने का निर्णय Trade और Traders की सेहत के लिए बिलकुल सही नहीं है यथा स्थिति बरकार रखने के लिए पूरे Spice (Fiss) trade की और से विनती है .त्वरित intervation की अपेक्षा.

401 2018-11-30 16:47:48 Indeed. I moved ours over to an individual 401k allowing for a much broader range of investments better prepared for the continuation of the 2008 financial crisis. Every crisis creates equal, and more focused, opportunities to thrive. Commodities, mining stocks, farm land, etc.

403 2018-11-30 16:37:56 Women in Congress are treated like commodities. Over years many women have openly come out in media and said that they were asked to compromise for power. 
Women Wine Wealth are 3W of Congress & spoils of their power. Each congress Minister has a extra martial affair. It’s common
404 2018-11-30 16:31:24 Los commodities se verán impactados por la eventual baja del dólar contra otras monedas importantes, pero ante todo cuando deje de ser patrón de referencia, ahí su valor será un 30-40% más bajo del actual.
405 2018-11-30 16:31:18 GND would be a great step forward! But a real goal is to guarantee that people, the future and the planet won't be commodities at all!
406 2018-11-30 16:27:26 He is tough with immigration; it’s debilitating to a city having thousands and thousands of needy sick people come in just like that, demanding for commodities and human rights when they don’t act like humans. I speak for everyone in my city, WE WANT THE MIGRANTS OUT! (9).
407 2018-11-30 16:26:03 And if this system is a temp one focused on getting people back out into the work force and off assistance I would be inclined to support it.  Social safety nets can be good but they do not require making commodities rights.
408 2018-11-30 16:25:17 Predicted categories for prospective crypto commodities and tokens: $BTC - stored value $TRX - gaming/gambling  and entertainment content $XLM - act as credit  $XRP - will act as paper 
409 2018-11-30 16:20:16 #Procurement should always “Prove and show their worth” by tracking historic and final cost when sourcing commodities and services as well as negotiating or renegotiating contracts. Document supply/demand management levers and value outcomes.
410 2018-11-30 16:19:33 I'm more than a little concerned with your push to price fix a commodities market.  Whose pocket are you in this time?
411 2018-11-30 16:18:49 Govt. Should trading Ban on consumption FMCG commodities from Future market, Farmers ll motivate to produce more, inflation controlled, import reduce & export boost, farmers get price that help to reduce Agri huge NPA, Mn agri MSME also get benefitted, Election benefits also.

414 2018-11-30 16:15:00 Crypto twitter has been quite for some reason as of late.  This is what happens with speculative commodities.
415 2018-11-30 16:14:25 Pass on gold and commodities (and longer-term bonds and allocations excessively weighted to large cap stocks), the rest are in the DFA 60/40 Balanced Strategy with obvious benefits I’d say

418 2018-11-30 16:06:27 Someday I am absolutely going to do a Futures Market/Ars Magica game, since it was ultimately all about commodities, and the result will basically be a slightly less cool version of @maxgladstone's stuff.
419 2018-11-30 16:05:24 You keep on asking as if DLC Third Way "New Democrats" haven't run shop for 30 years. We see the fruits of thier labor, Gramm-Leach-Billy, Commodities Futures modernization act, telecommunications act of 96 etc. Bernie has always said he can't do it by himself but we need to vote
420 2018-11-30 16:02:55 could we live without emerging mkts, gold, commodities, reits, small caps, etc (smart beta) for the next 20-40 years too?
421 2018-11-30 15:59:48 Use your voice so your words can be heard. Do not allow yourself to be passively led to your time and energy being misused. Stand your ground and assert that your time/energy are valuable commodities that are yours to use as you please.
422 2018-11-30 15:58:07 THEY ARE THE CARTELS!!!!!  The cartels hire/use people like this woman ALL of the time to illegally transport drugs and guns and other illegal commodities. It works BECAUSE she’s a “mother” with “five children ,” and what kind of person would question HER?!?!? 
423 2018-11-30 15:56:47 america is so disgusting turning trauma, oppression, and death into commodities.
424 2018-11-30 15:55:49 I hope so thx for posting ag commodities!
425 2018-11-30 15:54:31 You down with this move? I'm usually in favor of giving up unknowns for proven commodities. Definitely a win-now move, but I don't know how much runway Cano has left on him. Diaz is fire though apparently...haven't seen him pitch myself though, just what I've heard.
426 2018-11-30 15:51:24 Products and services are only commodities if you treat them that way.
427 2018-11-30 15:49:17 See Nigeria news (made CNY 2nd reserve currency to ease USD shortage.)  Or yesterday's Russia news (issuing EUR bonds 1st time in 5 yrs).  Multi-currency oil/commodities is happening.  USD liquidity will be eased by sales of $7T in USD FX rsvs.
428 2018-11-30 15:45:28 Many traders trade dollar ranges (absolute values). That amplifies bitcoin volatility at these depressed levels => a 300 range now = 7% move. This should adjust down with time were BTC to remain at these levels. This phenomema is also observed in other commodities after a crash.
429 2018-11-30 15:45:08 Farmers are not making headlines. You are turning them into headlines. If govt gives more prices of agricultural commodities and consequently prices of food items go up what will be your stand. You will have some more headlines.

431 2018-11-30 15:35:09 So you think someone who has built a large successful business and traded in commodities every day is ignorant do you?
432 2018-11-30 15:35:02 Sí, más que productos, commodities, porque el modelo económico y exportador de #Macri no está basado en la industria "El modelo de país que quiere #Macri es India (...)
