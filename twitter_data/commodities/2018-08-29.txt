212 2018-08-29 16:44:35 See the number of people paying taxes. Tax to GDP is raising. If this continues prices of various commodities will reduce bcoz of tax reduction. Soceity is now tax abiding, not evading @fayedsouza
213 2018-08-29 16:35:18 Is marketed to make the poor strive towards the ideal we’re all told we want. The people who have those ideal (loose term) lives are commodities bought and sold as marketable goods. The poor think those “things” achieved what they could not but still continue to strive for.
214 2018-08-29 16:34:14 Igual es una discusión estéril. Inflación hay. El dólar sube. Y punto. Pero siempre me llamo la atención que somos el único país en el mundo q mide su economía en dólares cuando su moneda es otra, siendo q ella commodities dolarizados lo están para todo el mundo
215 2018-08-29 16:28:00 IMO he's wrong about commodities (short term) and correct about equities.  Even a broken clock is right twice a day....
216 2018-08-29 16:27:34 UKmarket slipped into the red, caused in part by continuing concerns over U.S.-China relations.

221 2018-08-29 16:13:48 Filthy corrupt person making such statement just adds to credibility of the campaign against saleable commodities in media arena.
222 2018-08-29 16:11:57 I thought the same yesterday. IMO, that debate will fade. Waymo and Tesla are spending more and more time on the functional part: They have a realtime model of the world, what to do in each situation?

America deserves better, and we the people must demand a higher standard to protect our democracy and moral authority.
228 2018-08-29 15:45:09 Los economistas de cambiemos y del kirschnerismo son ambos unos inoperantes. Los K tuvieron la suerte de tener precios de los commodities altísimos y tasas de interés muy bajas o nulas es EEUU. La política económica K fue nefasta, tuvieron huracanes de cola nada más.
229 2018-08-29 15:41:18 You mean to say the world in 2012 was same as 2018? Does only crude price decide the cost of commodities. Aren't their lateral expenses such as labour costs, service charges, duties, etc that have risen?
230 2018-08-29 15:41:10 What does complicate it is tax funded programs that pay farms not to produce certain commodities! Selling grain etc to 3rd countries at greatly reduced prices! It’s harms their own agricultural industries!

234 2018-08-29 15:33:48 What is missing in all these analysis about the cost of PoW is that a supply shock causing the price of energy to rise as high as it has in previous instances will destroy all their math. We've been in a declining real energy cost regime commodities don't always operate this way.

237 2018-08-29 15:32:22 O Lula fez um bom governo no primeiro mandato, porque o Brasil surfava na onda dos commodities e vinha de uma estabilidade econômica. No segundo já foi capenga. Com a Dilma foi um desastre econômico, fazendo com que muitos pequenos e micros fechassem. Justiça é o Lula preso.

312 2018-08-29 13:01:18 I agree,  there is actually quite very little economic value of Canadian trade commodities ( excluding oil )
313 2018-08-29 12:59:34 The larger point is that the frivolous stuff are commodities which can have a value placed on them and thus get cheaper based on volume and efficiency- the things you mention can’t have a uniform value and thus they are hard to enforce universally.
314 2018-08-29 12:59:27 2/3 So what I meant with this tweet is that every-day people have a chance of getting a decent amount of money with cryptos to: buy a house, pay off their debt, afford quality commodities, and have a shot at creating wealth for themselves.
315 2018-08-29 12:53:17 Owners want to deunionize the mines, mechanize to the max. They have no affinity for miners other than as commodities. What good is coal if it doesn’t support the communities where it’s mined?

320 2018-08-29 12:12:39 Shorting crypto very dangerous as it is the asset that goes up the most over time... Short term (1-2 years) odds to go down but long term odds to go up, unlike commodities where inverse is true, so a much better asset to short
321 2018-08-29 12:11:38 The SP500 is up 8% Ytd (just look at the graphic I tweeted), commodities are up on average 20-30% Ytd, housing prices in Tampa are up 15% (broadly which doesn’t reflect real inflation) and you’re celebrating a $741 a year ($28.50 p/check) pay raise. Please tell me you’re joking?

333 2018-08-29 10:29:26 Presently UK had secured no deal for brexit. Its going to be hard on UK's economy. Hence they are on the look out for best deal outside EU.

349 2018-08-29 09:00:10 It's back to school again and prices for basic commodities have sky-rocketed. Zimbabwe is on auto-pilot. The pilot has taken a big nap in the cockpit. Understandably so because of age.
350 2018-08-29 08:41:37 That will mean also developing a product-focused food strategy. Processing Irish farm produce into commodities using centralized stainless steel is not working for farmers, for rural communities or for tourism. No sign of change, more of a case of just build some more.
351 2018-08-29 08:40:24 The corporate definition of love is obsessed with commodities, property, and hoarding of things and experiences.

395 2018-08-29 04:45:29 These tariffs incentivize cronyism, where certain companies get exceptions as determined by a central planner. They also have side effects, where supplies cost US manufacturers more and agricultural commodities drop in price. Hence, the "farm bailout."

421 2018-08-29 01:24:09 They killed them to make money. Their lives were commodities. The animals were justified in fighting for their freedom and lives by any means necessary.
